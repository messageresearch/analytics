[0:28] for
[2:07] good morning everyone morning good
[2:10] morning Saints good morning God blessed
[2:13] people and uh I'm happy I'm excited to
[2:17] be here amen it's wonderful to see all
[2:19] your faces it's wonderful to see young
[2:22] children grow and um yeah we we were
[2:26] talking in the in the car on on the way
[2:28] here um about the verse I think they did
[2:30] last week the younger ones um around do
[2:34] not hinder the children coming to me and
[2:37] trying to explain that and say well
[2:39] we're all children we all
[2:42] Jesus he's he's our father and uh we are
[2:45] all children they are our children we
[2:48] we're Guardians over them and uh but in
[2:51] the end there's only one one God one one
[2:54] father for us amen
[2:56] um that's right I don't know who
[2:58] listened to the um this why not why not
[3:02] me why not now um it struck struck a
[3:05] cord with me I think with a lot of
[3:07] people um and my mind wondered at the
[3:11] point where is it brother Cadre is that
[3:13] what you say um talk about talk about
[3:16] David and he's on his way to uh to meet
[3:19] this giant and uh I was I was thinking
[3:23] because now I heard I I need to do the
[3:25] the songs this week I was thinking you
[3:27] need to create an atmosphere and I think
[3:29] David was you know at the stream and was
[3:32] picking out his Pebbles and it was
[3:33] interesting that it was five Pebbles and
[3:35] faithless spout with five letters and
[3:37] stuff like that so I was thinking ah
[3:39] he's picking it up and the enemy is just
[3:42] there you can see them but would he
[3:45] would he would have would he have stand
[3:48] there and panicked would he have stand
[3:49] there and created that atmosphere that
[3:53] um called upon that anointing to come
[3:55] over him and
[3:56] say what do I do or and and we know he
[4:00] was a great musician so he I think he
[4:03] either prayed or he sang a song and I
[4:06] think he was picking up his pebles and
[4:08] he was looking at that would it be big
[4:10] enough but while he's doing that he he
[4:12] was probably whistling he was probably
[4:14] um doing something like um As the deer
[4:17] panth at the water you know um creating
[4:21] an atmosphere and going into that that
[4:23] rest and that peace to say I'm not Fe
[4:26] I'm not fighting this enemy it's God
[4:28] that's fighting it for me
[4:30] and
[4:31] um and with and like the same song that
[4:33] we well the song that we will start
[4:34] today what a mighty God we serve he
[4:36] might have might have say that who knows
[4:39] um but it was just wonderful cuz he was
[4:42] I think he was he was at peace um with
[4:45] the Enemy just on the other side of the
[4:47] stream I think he um he he created that
[4:50] that right atmosphere so and um what I
[4:53] wanted to get to is he was he was Serena
[4:57] to God he was he was giving he was was
[4:59] worshiping in all his Strife or well it
[5:02] seemed like Strife around him he was he
[5:04] was worshiping God he was enjoying um to
[5:07] spend time with God doesn't matter about
[5:09] his surroundings or atmosphere um well
[5:13] he created the
[5:15] atmosphere so what we are doing here
[5:17] today the musicians in front and
[5:19] hopefully you can keep this thought is
[5:21] we're not cating to you we and and you
[5:24] are not sitting there waiting to be
[5:26] sermonized is that a
[5:28] word we we need to serenate to God we
[5:31] need to all get up have your have your
[5:33] moment here and doesn't matter about the
[5:35] atmosphere and anything goes around you
[5:37] who who's had a tough week I've had a
[5:40] tremendous tough week um but then at the
[5:43] end of it retrospectively you go back
[5:44] and say well this is a tremendous week
[5:47] Satan just couldn't keep me alone he
[5:49] just didn't want to you know have that
[5:52] have that nearo walk to uh or try and
[5:55] prevent that near walk to him so before
[5:59] I'm babbling on too much let's open up
[6:02] and pray and
[6:04] pray thank you Jesus that we can have

[41:54] that takes a stand Amen in this
[41:57] generation or any generation there's
[41:58] ever been they will fight the greatest
[42:02] battle otherwise they're just in it and
[42:04] they're just part of that enemy's
[42:06] Kingdom and they can just do what they
[42:07] like and it's pretty easy and they go
[42:09] through all sorts of things but for you
[42:11] and for me and for those that make a
[42:13] stand in their day for the I am for the
[42:16] everpresent God for those that make a
[42:18] stand there is a fight hallelujah amen
[42:22] and so I called this the greatest battle
[42:25] ever thought
[42:26] is exposed now we're going to expose
[42:29] this we're going to expose the enemy and
[42:31] we're going to expose in a positive way
[42:34] the provision of the Lord and how it
[42:35] applies to us because we need change in
[42:38] our lives amen we need channels cleared
[42:41] we need things unblocked amen we don't
[42:44] even we might think that we've got all
[42:46] of them unblocked but remember God sees
[42:49] deeper and he can go deeper and he can
[42:51] bring healing down in the depths
[42:53] Hallelujah and he will and this morning
[42:56] you're going to be healed with something
[42:57] this morning you're going to have
[42:58] channels unblocked Hallelujah is that
[43:00] your
[43:01] expectation amen hallelujah hallelujah
[43:05] let's turn our Bibles to um Romans
[43:08] 1:21
[43:11] Hallelujah the subject this
[43:13] morning well I kind of just wanted to
[43:16] put it in a synopsis is the extent of
[43:19] the in Corruption of the entire world
[43:23] and the standoff between Michael and
[43:25] Lucifer raised Aging in the minds of
[43:27] humanity I know that sounds like a lot
[43:29] but really that's just sort of what
[43:31] we're going
[43:33] into amen let's just read because that
[43:36] oh sorry verse 21 Romans 1: 21-27 it
[43:39] says because that when they knew God
[43:41] they glorified him not as God neither
[43:44] were thankful but became vain in their
[43:47] imaginations remember we're dealing with
[43:49] the mind now this is how Satan gets
[43:53] in they became vain in their imagination
[43:56] and their foolish heart was darkened
[43:58] professing themselves to be wise they
[44:01] became
[44:03] fools there's the degradation of the in
[44:05] deluvian world right there in four four
[44:08] components they glorified him not as God
[44:11] when they knew him just like this
[44:14] generation is
[44:15] doing neither were they thankful amen
[44:18] then they became vain in their
[44:20] imaginations that's
[44:21] three and their foolish heart was
[44:24] darkened four
[44:26] the four stages of the anal luian
[44:29] degradation and you're seeing you're
[44:31] living in the middle of another complete
[44:34] repeat of what's happened
[44:36] there and it says here professing
[44:39] themselves to be wise they became fools
[44:40] and changed the glory of the
[44:42] uncorruptible god into an image made
[44:44] like corruptible
[44:45] man now that is what man that's religion
[44:50] and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[44:52] creeping things and wherefore God also
[44:55] gave them up to un cleanness through the
[44:56] lust of their own Hearts to dishonor
[44:59] their own bodies between themselves who
[45:01] change the truth of God into a lie and
[45:04] worshiped and served the creature more
[45:05] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[45:08] amen for this cause God gave them up to
[45:11] vile
[45:14] affections for even their woman did
[45:16] change the natural use into that which
[45:18] is against nature and likewise also the
[45:21] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[45:24] burned in their lust one to towards
[45:26] another men with men working that which
[45:29] is unseemly and receiving in themselves
[45:31] the recompense of their error which was
[45:34] meat let's turn to 2 Timothy
[45:41] 3 remember the extent of the enemy's
[45:44] Corruption of the entire
[45:46] world because this is a personal thing
[45:48] that we are dealing with and a and an
[45:51] exodus that we're coming out of and a
[45:53] Deliverance that's happening in our
[45:54] lives and we're all born with that in us
[45:57] and we actually live with that on us you
[46:00] believe it or not but you still wear
[46:01] this body and it's still got all that
[46:03] stuff in it amen and we spoke about on
[46:06] Wednesday how you've been given a
[46:07] jubilee you've been given dominion over
[46:09] that stuff but you need a feast on the
[46:11] body word of the son of man to give your
[46:14] soul a jubilee out of that so that you
[46:16] can tell that what to do and take
[46:18] control of your own
[46:19] Spirit otherwise you're a City built
[46:21] without walls and whatever comes in it
[46:23] just this big Highway in and out of your
[46:25] life causing you to do whatever the
[46:27] devil wants you to do but the word of
[46:30] God has come in this generation to give
[46:32] you discernment between good and evil so
[46:33] that you can discern the Antichrist
[46:35] spirit in your midst and he will become
[46:37] powerless against you
[46:40] right 2 Timothy
[46:43] 3:8 this know also that in the last days
[46:46] perilous times shall come for men shall
[46:49] be lovers of their own selves Covetous
[46:52] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[46:56] unthankful Unholy without natural
[46:59] affection they need something else to
[47:01] make them have
[47:04] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[47:07] incontinent fears despisers of those
[47:09] that are good traitors heady High minded
[47:12] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[47:14] God having a form of godliness meaning
[47:17] this they go to church but denying power
[47:21] thereof from and the power is not just
[47:23] the anointing the power is the word the
[47:27] word has the power in it the word has
[47:29] the original life in it that will bring
[47:32] you back to the original life that will
[47:34] transform you not just the anointing
[47:38] because you can go to Pentecost you can
[47:39] go to charismatic and have an anointing
[47:42] a genuine anointing and see Supernatural
[47:45] That's not the power of God that's the
[47:47] blessings of God these people are
[47:49] denying the transforming power of the
[47:51] word to transform them even the words
[47:54] that you're hearing this morning which
[47:56] are the words of God has got the power
[47:58] inside it to transform every part of
[48:00] your life and that's God's provision for
[48:02] you Hallelujah whether it comes from my
[48:05] mouth any ministerial mouth you're the
[48:08] word of God when you're listening to the
[48:09] prophet when you're reading the Bible
[48:11] when it's the transforming power of the
[48:13] word the expectation we have when we
[48:15] hear it will change what how it affects
[48:17] our life if we just listen to it as
[48:20] information to get more intellectual
[48:22] understanding that's all you will get
[48:24] but if we realize there's power inside
[48:26] there to change us am we will receive
[48:30] that
[48:33] transformation lovers of pleasure more
[48:35] than lovers of God having a form of
[48:36] godliness but denying the power thereof
[48:38] from such turn away now as janny's and
[48:41] jambre withstood Moses so do these also
[48:44] resist the truth oh sorry I skipped a
[48:46] few verses now as Janny I skipped to
[48:48] eight now as Janes and jambre withstood
[48:51] Moses so do these also resist the truth
[48:54] men have corrupt Minds reprobate
[48:57] concerning the
[48:59] faith amen just finally now from Daniel
[49:03] 12 to draw another a
[49:08] context because remember we're talking
[49:10] about the greatest
[49:11] battle this is this is no small thing
[49:15] this is no thing to just put it as a
[49:18] category in your life of of the message
[49:21] or that things that you're taught the
[49:23] battle in your mind is the foremost
[49:26] battle that you will face it's something
[49:28] that you should never neglect or never
[49:31] just think okay I'll deal with this deal
[49:33] with it first have God have that that's
[49:36] that's such an important thing in your
[49:38] life and is the pivotal point of your
[49:40] Victory to walk in this flesh is to
[49:43] understand and to receive the
[49:45] transforming power of God's Mighty power
[49:48] to deliver you and to raise you up so
[49:50] that you can have a good that you can
[49:53] work in this realm in this arena with
[49:55] the Enemy
[49:56] amen the the Bible says my people perish
[49:58] for lack of knowledge that word
[50:00] knowledge is an understanding of law an
[50:03] understanding in the court so meaning
[50:06] say say if someone doesn't understand a
[50:08] legal system and they're standing in
[50:11] court representing themselves and the
[50:13] devil's right there and he understands
[50:15] everything the prosecuting lawyer and
[50:17] he's got all these things that he's just
[50:19] using against you if you don't
[50:20] understand what you have you're just
[50:22] going to be he's going to be you're
[50:23] going to be powerless against him but if
[50:25] you can
[50:26] understand what you have he will be
[50:27] powerless against you because he has no
[50:30] legal right over you amen and you've
[50:32] received a message that's clearing
[50:34] everything that's ever been against your
[50:35] name and every complex that's been in
[50:37] your life every blockage and every
[50:39] channel in your life you've received a
[50:41] message that will clean all that out
[50:43] because the me you're hearing is the
[50:45] Original Seed of the word which is
[50:47] coming into your life and it's got the
[50:48] very spirit of God inside it to
[50:50] transform you Amen brother Brandon
[50:53] preached the transforming power of God
[50:57] the God's power to transform it's a good
[50:59] sermon have a listen as he's speaking
[51:01] about those things now let's read Daniel
[51:03] 12 1 and
[51:05] two and at that time shall Michael stand
[51:08] up th great Prince which standeth for
[51:11] the children of thy people and there
[51:13] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[51:16] was since there was a nation even to
[51:19] that same time and at that time thy
[51:22] people shall be delivered everyone that
[51:25] shall be found written in the book Let's
[51:28] just bow our heads father we thank you
[51:30] Lord and just pray you'd add your
[51:31] blessing to the reading of your word and
[51:34] father just draw a context from these
[51:36] scriptures and father just take us on a
[51:38] journey Lord we just want to hear from
[51:40] you whisper your your secrets into our
[51:43] ears father as it were for Lord we we
[51:46] are a needy people and I pray you'd have
[51:48] your way now Bless the people father May
[51:51] Lord our minds and our hearts Lord be
[51:53] focused May the children be settled and
[51:56] may we hear from Heaven this morning
[51:58] Father Lord and may we never forget Lord
[52:02] what we hear this morning may it be such
[52:04] a an awesome time with you father All
[52:07] Because Of You Lord we depend on you in
[52:10] Jesus Christ's name amen
[52:14] hallelujah normally I um you can have
[52:17] your seats
[52:18] sorry
[52:24] Hallelujah just want to take a a Sunday
[52:27] school this morning but more of an
[52:30] Evangelical Sunday school so there'll be
[52:32] a bit of reading a bit of quotes I just
[52:35] you know normally I only use maybe one
[52:37] quote and then we just keep going you
[52:39] know but I just want to read a little
[52:41] bit because the prophet says it so well
[52:44] I just I can't add to it I can't take
[52:47] away from it I can just say it as he
[52:49] says it and it's just been such a
[52:51] blessing do we have that clicker thing
[52:54] still right somewhere buried in the bags
[52:59] somewhere amen and God saw that the
[53:02] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[53:05] and that every imagination of the
[53:07] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[53:09] continually and it repented the Lord
[53:11] that he had made man on the earth and it
[53:13] grieved him at his
[53:15] heart as it was in the days of Noah so
[53:18] shall it be when the son of man is being
[53:20] revealed who believes that the son of
[53:23] man is being revealed in this generation
[53:26] that Christ has come and he's revealing
[53:29] himself and he revealed himself in a
[53:32] prophet and then he took the prophet off
[53:34] the scene and he
[53:36] stayed he stayed and he's continuing to
[53:40] reveal himself through the message that
[53:42] the prophet brought see a prophet
[53:45] preaches differently than a minister a
[53:49] prophet preaches in seed form there are
[53:53] prophetic Ministries that also preach in
[53:54] seed form as well but it's it's a minor
[53:57] compared to how a prophet preaches and
[53:59] so the example we have is Jesus Christ
[54:03] when he preached you can take anything
[54:05] he said now and he and it sounds so
[54:08] simple it's very simple what he says he
[54:10] uses Parables and he uses seeds and he
[54:12] uses trees but you can take that now and
[54:15] preach 5,000 sermons from it more one
[54:19] little sentence what is seed says
[54:22] preaching seed now a prophet comes in
[54:24] this generation and he also preaches in
[54:27] seed form so that so that over the next
[54:30] 50 years things have been opening to us
[54:32] that we've never even seen and they
[54:34] didn't see back then and and and and and
[54:37] and the understanding is being
[54:38] enlightened because that same Lord Jesus
[54:42] is unveiling himself the son of man
[54:44] Ministry is being revealed the body word
[54:48] of the son of man is the feast that we
[54:50] have been gathered to where the
[54:52] carcasses the Eagles will be gathered
[54:54] this is our the in there is the power
[54:58] for our Exodus in there is the power for
[55:00] our Jubilee Jubilee from our s Jubilee
[55:05] from everything that we were born with
[55:07] cuz we were born with corruption we were
[55:10] born deranged
[55:13] derailed born in sin full of lies with a
[55:17] a path that was just going to take us
[55:19] into
[55:21] destruction and you can go to any
[55:23] denomination I'll tell you this now any
[55:26] denomination and you'll you'll just
[55:28] Plateau at a certain level you'll come
[55:30] out of that stuff and you'll just
[55:32] Plateau at a certain level you just
[55:35] can't go
[55:36] further you you just can't until finally
[55:40] you hear the word for your day that seed
[55:43] word the truth of the scripture will
[55:47] actually take you out of that deranged
[55:51] thought pattern and uncorrupt your mind
[55:56] and break spiritual
[55:58] Amnesia we are born not knowing who we
[56:01] are but one day we hear the eagle
[56:05] scream amen and when you hear that eagle
[56:09] scream it starts to sound familiar and
[56:12] now the remedy to break your Amnesia is
[56:15] is is sounding upon your
[56:18] ears and it's starting to break those
[56:20] things and you're starting to see those
[56:21] things and your mind is wrestling
[56:23] against it but the heart down deep is
[56:27] rejoicing in the waters of the word amen
[56:30] and then as you come into the presence
[56:32] of the Lord and you Fellowship in that
[56:35] presence he turns the water into wine
[56:38] and it starts to inebriate you amen it
[56:42] starts to make you feel good Hallelujah
[56:44] because that's the stimulation of
[56:46] Revelation Hallelujah he's starting to
[56:50] set you free he's giving you a
[56:52] transforming power to transform you from
[56:55] what you were covered in darkness a a
[56:59] seed of a lily down in the depths of a
[57:01] pond all murky and horrible and growing
[57:04] up through all of the creepy crawlies
[57:06] and finally you're going to come out and
[57:08] spread your petals amen and soak in the
[57:12] sun Hallelujah to come into the full
[57:15] strength sunlight so that you can
[57:17] photosynthesize the word of God and then
[57:20] you finally that
[57:22] channel where there's such a connection
[57:24] between you and God and he starts to
[57:27] clean everything out the sunlight is is
[57:29] an antiseptic the sunlight is a stain
[57:32] remover
[57:34] Hallelujah and the Bible many places and
[57:38] I'm just going to paraphrase it all that
[57:41] in every age light came forth light came
[57:44] forth light came forth but they were
[57:46] only one color of the rainbow and then
[57:48] finally in the last age all of it came
[57:51] forth and it became
[57:53] White see if you look at color science I
[57:57] guess you can call it light that all the
[57:59] colors together make white light now if
[58:03] you now we are we are beneficiaries of
[58:05] white light shining the white light now
[58:09] has the full capability to to to take
[58:13] all the stains away amen so now what we
[58:18] need to do cuz we're still a free moral
[58:20] agent we can walk below our privilege if
[58:23] we like God's not going to we still got
[58:25] in the Rapture if you if you've been
[58:27] filled with the Holy Ghost and you can
[58:29] walk and just struggle and be trampled
[58:31] on by every devil if you want you can
[58:33] choose that or you can choose now to
[58:36] open your petals to the Lord open your
[58:39] mind and let the word of God
[58:42] penetrate to
[58:44] penetrate right down because there's a
[58:48] spirit inside the word which is the
[58:50] spirit of God that will transform you
[58:53] you just need now in your own free moral
[58:56] agency to expose yourself to everything
[58:59] God has given with
[59:03] that we will go to slide
[59:06] two and just click it
[59:08] again sorry it's small you just never
[59:10] know way until you actually bring it
[59:13] up the importance of being placed by the
[59:16] anointed word see the word does
[59:19] everything we not going to cover
[59:21] everything but the word does everything
[59:22] right we can have our we can hang our
[59:24] soul upon the word of God and and not
[59:26] just the information now the power the
[59:28] life the very mind and will of God the
[59:32] motives and objectives and intentions of
[59:35] God our Father the father of our spirits
[59:39] to to to to accomplish now in in Isaiah
[59:44] it says that that the it's the intense
[59:47] devotion of God that will perform
[59:50] this he he's intensely devoted to his
[59:53] cause he says he will he will accomplish
[59:56] this Covenant and he will cause it with
[59:58] all of his heart and with all of his
[1:00:00] soul he's intensely devoted to your
[1:00:04] success to your Exodus to your Jubilee
[1:00:08] to your freedom amen and this is the age
[1:00:12] where he's clearing everything off
[1:00:14] hallelujah what a beneficiary we are
[1:00:17] amen we don't it's not that we pray more
[1:00:20] or enter in more or do more or study
[1:00:23] more or no more is that we are in an age
[1:00:26] where he's giving more we are
[1:00:29] beneficiaries of the final move of God's
[1:00:32] spirit to prepare us to change us to
[1:00:35] Rapture us off the Earth amen but now as
[1:00:39] we are in this and we can see these
[1:00:41] things and we have an expectation for
[1:00:43] these things and it's exciting but yet
[1:00:46] now we're walking in the natural and now
[1:00:49] we have a mind battle and now we are a
[1:00:52] great lovely group you know and it's
[1:00:56] wonderful but the devil is already at
[1:00:58] work and he's putting thoughts
[1:01:01] everywhere trying to put us back into
[1:01:03] stale mate that's like an old church
[1:01:06] with baggage he wants that again so now
[1:01:09] sermon this that's my burden is that we
[1:01:12] will he will be powerless against us
[1:01:15] we'll have discernment against the
[1:01:17] Antichrist Spirit we'll have love in our
[1:01:19] hearts and we will understand the
[1:01:21] Dynamics of the spiritual warfare sorry
[1:01:25] to use big long words but man I don't
[1:01:26] know how to say it anyway
[1:01:31] else he that has no
[1:01:34] rule over his own spirit is like a city
[1:01:37] that is broken down and Without
[1:01:40] Walls it's quite a quite a verse that he
[1:01:44] that has no rule over his own spirit is
[1:01:48] like a city that is broken down and
[1:01:50] Without Walls click again please
[1:01:55] Proverbs
[1:01:56] 16:32 he that is slow to anger and is
[1:02:00] better or is better than the mighty and
[1:02:04] he that rules his Spirit than he that
[1:02:07] takes a
[1:02:08] city it's a very um this place this is
[1:02:13] like the utopic place of a of a Believer
[1:02:17] to be in Dominion to be placed back in
[1:02:22] Dominion in your life not to to be
[1:02:24] tossed about by every wind of Doctrine
[1:02:26] tossed about by every thought that the
[1:02:28] devil just has a field day and places
[1:02:30] them on you cuz he's going to do that
[1:02:32] he's going to send an army every now and
[1:02:35] again he's going to fire 4,000 fiery
[1:02:37] darts at
[1:02:39] you now someone that is in this position
[1:02:44] they're going to that's going to be dumb
[1:02:45] of course it's never easy it's never
[1:02:49] Pleasant and every time a thought comes
[1:02:52] it's not just information that comes
[1:02:53] it's the spirit and the emotional
[1:02:55] attachment to the
[1:02:57] thought and when we realize that then we
[1:03:00] don't get condemned by feeling that way
[1:03:02] but you can deal with it straight
[1:03:04] away cuz it's not see it's not when when
[1:03:08] the devil starts giving you a thought of
[1:03:10] Discord or something that's going to try
[1:03:12] and Tackle down the atmosphere in the
[1:03:14] church you know when he starts to give
[1:03:16] you those thoughts or starts to make you
[1:03:18] feel condemned or unworthy or whatever
[1:03:21] you don't it's not just information
[1:03:22] going in your head it's the feeling of
[1:03:24] it you feel
[1:03:27] unworthy but doesn't matter how bad you
[1:03:30] feel it doesn't matter how much you feel
[1:03:33] what you're thinking that's normal you
[1:03:35] always do cuz a thought is a spirit you
[1:03:39] know it's a concept it's it's deep they
[1:03:43] can't even describe it you know I went
[1:03:44] on a website to try and find out what a
[1:03:46] thought is you know like what psychology
[1:03:48] world thinks and they they just can't
[1:03:49] describe it they cannot find the origin
[1:03:52] without going into spiritual
[1:03:55] uality they can't and even then they
[1:03:57] don't they they don't so it's it's it's
[1:03:59] deeper than we think that have thought
[1:04:00] Remember come we can take the thought
[1:04:02] back to God or we can take the thought
[1:04:04] back to Satan
[1:04:07] corruption okay
[1:04:09] so if we read this here says for though
[1:04:14] we walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:04:17] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:04:19] are not caral but Mighty through God
[1:04:23] Amen Mighty through God Amen to the
[1:04:27] pulling down of strongholds sometimes
[1:04:29] the devil gets in sometimes we get found
[1:04:33] we find ourselves with a couple of
[1:04:35] strongholds in us and now you're in a
[1:04:37] little battle and it feels like a really
[1:04:39] big battle you know and he's managed you
[1:04:42] you've let him in you stopped for a
[1:04:44] second you started reasoning With the
[1:04:47] Enemy you know because sometimes it
[1:04:49] feels good feels like you can justify
[1:04:51] what that person
[1:04:53] did and then you find yourself feeling
[1:04:56] bitter you
[1:04:57] know says be careful unless the root of
[1:05:00] bitterness rise up and strangle and
[1:05:03] start to strangle you
[1:05:05] down cause a stalemate cause a cause a
[1:05:08] glitch a breach in the
[1:05:11] fellowship but we have power Mighty
[1:05:13] through God now to pull down those
[1:05:15] strongholds amen if anyone's got a
[1:05:17] stronghold this morning it can be pulled
[1:05:19] down right here it can be pulled down
[1:05:23] Hallelujah just be sincere be
[1:05:29] transparent casting down notice in here
[1:05:32] there's a lot of uh verbs there's a lot
[1:05:35] of doing and expressions and actions
[1:05:37] it's not just Doctrine this is this is
[1:05:40] your Warfare
[1:05:42] here casting down imaginations and every
[1:05:45] High thing that exalts itself against
[1:05:48] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:05:51] captivity every thought
[1:05:55] to The Obedience of Christ and being
[1:05:57] alert to Revenge all
[1:06:00] Disobedience when you're dis when your
[1:06:02] obedience is
[1:06:05] fulfilled
[1:06:10] amen you go to the next
[1:06:13] one some of you have seen this before I
[1:06:16] sort of simplified it a bit just because
[1:06:18] there's too much writing on there before
[1:06:20] but what we have here this is you
[1:06:22] everyone's seen this brother has
[1:06:24] preached on it youve heard many sermons
[1:06:26] on it no
[1:06:28] doubt we are a
[1:06:30] soul we have a spirit and we live in a
[1:06:33] body that's right the soul is the person
[1:06:37] the spirit is and is is the Mind realm
[1:06:40] and the body is the vessel the house
[1:06:42] that you live
[1:06:43] in now this is a diagram that I have in
[1:06:47] my own way of understanding have the
[1:06:50] dove has flown into this person's heart
[1:06:52] they've been born again and and the
[1:06:54] Darkness is gone the snake has left the
[1:06:56] heart and the dove is flying in the
[1:06:58] heart now and that person has been set
[1:07:01] free and they've been walking with the
[1:07:03] Lord under the body word of the son of
[1:07:05] man the light of their age they're
[1:07:07] walking with the lord they're walking in
[1:07:09] the will of the lord they're in
[1:07:11] communion with the very present God not
[1:07:14] just a god of History not just a god of
[1:07:16] church or a god of Doctrine or a God of
[1:07:18] this or that but the person of Jesus
[1:07:22] Christ in his ex current expressed will
[1:07:26] the what he is doing the word he is
[1:07:28] fulfilling the lives that he's
[1:07:31] touching the program they are right up
[1:07:35] there with that bar where the Beats of
[1:07:37] the music is beating out in the symphony
[1:07:39] Hallelujah where the drums are going and
[1:07:41] where the violins are singing and where
[1:07:42] the where the where the obos are going
[1:07:45] amen where the clarinets are and the
[1:07:48] trumpets are blasting and the shout of
[1:07:50] the king is in the camp
[1:07:52] Hallelujah someone that's in that place
[1:07:55] can get to this utopic condition even
[1:07:59] though still covered in that Earth still
[1:08:02] covered in this flesh and it's still
[1:08:04] full of sin and it will always like sin
[1:08:07] and it will always enjoy looking at the
[1:08:09] pretty woman on the street it will
[1:08:10] always enjoy that horrible old stuff and
[1:08:13] fleshly things because it will never be
[1:08:15] converted that's right but because now
[1:08:18] the Dove's in there that Soul has been
[1:08:21] placed in its position that soul has
[1:08:24] been given Dominion amen over the spirit
[1:08:28] that person now can take rulership of
[1:08:31] their spirit and that Soul now with a
[1:08:34] discernment now because they got an
[1:08:36] understanding of God and an
[1:08:37] understanding of the word to how much
[1:08:40] the Lord reveals because we can only
[1:08:42] walk in what he's
[1:08:44] revealed really with power with
[1:08:49] conviction now that person now can have
[1:08:51] a clear memory Channel a clear
[1:08:53] conscience a clear reason a clear
[1:08:56] imagination a clear affection Channel
[1:08:59] That's controlled now by the soul that's
[1:09:02] not controlled by things that they hear
[1:09:04] not controlled by things that they feel
[1:09:06] not controlled by things that they taste
[1:09:08] smell or see now seeing and hearing is
[1:09:13] probably the the greatest offenders of
[1:09:16] our
[1:09:17] flesh smelling well you know always that
[1:09:22] bad
[1:09:24] tasting well you know sometimes it's
[1:09:26] pretty bad if you like
[1:09:31] me but but the
[1:09:34] hearing now the devil now uses these two
[1:09:37] channels a lot and he starts to bombard
[1:09:41] Humanity with his gospel with his
[1:09:44] preaching with his all the stuff that
[1:09:46] comes from him and we're going to go
[1:09:47] into this he starts bombarding your ears
[1:09:50] so the the concepts and the spirits that
[1:09:53] drive those things start to affect you
[1:09:55] and you wonder why you're having trouble
[1:09:57] with your thoughts you're wondering why
[1:09:59] you're struggling
[1:10:00] spiritually what are you listening to
[1:10:03] what what muck are you feeding into
[1:10:05] there you're wondering why that
[1:10:07] conscience is always always struggling
[1:10:10] and wondering why those imaginations are
[1:10:12] always coming and you're trying to pray
[1:10:13] and get down and the the thoughts are
[1:10:15] coming what is you're listening to what
[1:10:18] are these eyes seeing
[1:10:21] amen hallelujah the imagination clear
[1:10:25] the affections are clear that affection
[1:10:27] channel is a very bad offender you know
[1:10:29] you want to really get the Lord to
[1:10:31] really come in and and really start to
[1:10:34] clean these flu out and this
[1:10:37] morning the Lord himself is here if
[1:10:40] you've got any channels blocked he can
[1:10:43] he can f he can clear those out for you
[1:10:46] and he will clear them out for you you
[1:10:48] just lay it at his feet amen be sincere
[1:10:52] be transparent about it
[1:10:54] don't hide
[1:10:55] it you
[1:10:58] know and and you'll find yourself now
[1:11:00] coming and
[1:11:02] now because you see now why if if that's
[1:11:06] clear like that and those channels have
[1:11:08] got it they go They're not just a
[1:11:10] one-way channel in they're a channel out
[1:11:13] that's an expression of your
[1:11:15] spirit it's like a healthy home where
[1:11:19] the husband is connected with God and he
[1:11:23] he got a Godly character and you know
[1:11:26] and the wife is
[1:11:28] Happy
[1:11:30] Hallelujah the house is
[1:11:32] subdued
[1:11:35] amen happy in their place now there can
[1:11:39] be a communication now people can come
[1:11:41] and that wife is happy to have people
[1:11:43] around happy to have people because she
[1:11:46] she feels comfortable and
[1:11:50] secure the channels are clear amen the
[1:11:55] communication can be clear we can come
[1:11:57] around for fellowship and we can have
[1:11:59] glorious Fellowship because the channels
[1:12:01] are clear we can and not just for our
[1:12:04] own blessing or our own entertainment
[1:12:08] Fellowship is far more than
[1:12:09] entertainment Fellowship is is taking
[1:12:14] all the things that you've heard and
[1:12:16] coming with each other and talking about
[1:12:17] the Lord and and meditating on what
[1:12:19] you've heard and coming into Realms of
[1:12:22] of Glorious fellow Fellowship where
[1:12:24] we're talking about the Lord and then he
[1:12:26] comes near and and things that you
[1:12:28] didn't understand maybe click and it
[1:12:31] pieces together and the cogs start
[1:12:33] turning and the channels start clearing
[1:12:35] and you start communing with God
[1:12:37] hallelujah I've had wonderful times of
[1:12:39] Fellowship wonderful some of my most
[1:12:42] momentous Transformations have been in
[1:12:44] fellowship with people in my younger
[1:12:46] years still young but you know like very
[1:12:49] young when when you're still
[1:12:52] AWOL man you can imagine what I was
[1:12:55] like man I was just
[1:12:59] everywhere AB
[1:13:02] BR we were very excited about the
[1:13:04] message very excited but you know now
[1:13:06] the Lord starts to you know take that
[1:13:10] ambition or take that anointing and take
[1:13:12] that Zeal and start to channel it so
[1:13:15] that it become
[1:13:16] effective amen and some people it takes
[1:13:18] a bit more dealing than others you know
[1:13:22] because you just got you know it's just
[1:13:24] everyone's different everyone has their
[1:13:25] own different
[1:13:26] battles Hallelujah so this here is what
[1:13:31] we are attaining
[1:13:33] to let's go to slide
[1:13:37] four sorry you probably can't read that
[1:13:40] but I'll read it out says here now did
[1:13:43] you ever all of you has had this times
[1:13:48] that when you would think well I don't
[1:13:50] know whether it could happen or not and
[1:13:53] all at once something just tells you
[1:13:56] it's going to
[1:13:58] happen regardless of what anybody else
[1:14:01] says you know it's going to happen we've
[1:14:04] all had them
[1:14:05] experiences that's when your heart is
[1:14:08] thinking that's your heart telling you
[1:14:11] now the Mind reasons but the heart
[1:14:14] doesn't reason it just believes it if I
[1:14:17] could ever drive that home to one of my
[1:14:20] audience I'll have a real healing
[1:14:22] service if if I could ever get my
[1:14:25] audience to see that that it's not what
[1:14:27] your head thinks at all there's there's
[1:14:30] where the the devil abides but he
[1:14:34] reasons it out I'm sick I can't get well
[1:14:37] I got this or I can't be saved I've done
[1:14:40] this I've done too much see that's
[1:14:42] reason but we are to cast down
[1:14:44] reasonings that's right casting down our
[1:14:47] reasonings We Believe with our heart in
[1:14:50] the Garden of Eden man was divided in
[1:14:53] two Parts the devil took his head and
[1:14:56] God took his heart the devil makes him
[1:14:59] look at things and say well it just
[1:15:01] can't happen I can't reason it out and
[1:15:05] God took his heart to dwell in his heart
[1:15:07] to make him believe things that his head
[1:15:10] don't even know nothing about that's
[1:15:13] right so it's in your heart you think
[1:15:16] down here that's where the real certain
[1:15:20] sound comes from is from the heart
[1:15:23] there's where God talks and here's where
[1:15:26] the devil talks from up here he's
[1:15:29] pointing so let's cast down what the
[1:15:32] devil said and take a certain sound and
[1:15:36] that certain sound is God talking in our
[1:15:39] heart that's truth God's
[1:15:43] promises you know down here in the in
[1:15:45] the in the heart is where the is where
[1:15:48] is where your soul is and is where truth
[1:15:51] is and where you really believe and
[1:15:52] think
[1:15:55] now up here is the battle this is where
[1:15:58] good and evil starts coming now the
[1:16:00] heart will choose okay I'm going to

[1:16:19] now I'm going to cast one out because I
[1:16:22] know that's the enemy
[1:16:24] so be not weary and well-doing Fain not
[1:16:27] when it's raging you address that enemy
[1:16:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and

[1:24:08] everywhere you swim is Darkness every
[1:24:10] Church you go to is Darkness it's just
[1:24:13] all hopeless and that's what it is gross

[1:25:04] amen has given us a Liberation from
[1:25:06] these things he given us a jubilee has
[1:25:08] given us spiritual food in due season to

[1:25:30] preaching about all the stuff and not
[1:25:31] going or what can I do that's what you
[1:25:33] can do the reason I'm preaching these
[1:25:36] things is so that you can have an
[1:25:38] expectation when you are listening to it
[1:25:40] cuz all the stuff comes from
[1:25:42] here hallelujah this is so good it's
[1:25:45] amazing because here the Lord wants us
[1:25:47] to be in Jubilee He wants us to be
[1:25:49] liberated from all of this stuff and to
[1:25:52] have hope and to have faith and to have
[1:25:58] understanding what is it C taste F smell
[1:26:00] hair imagination conscious memory reason
[1:26:02] affections he begin to use all those
[1:26:05] different little channels as long as he
[1:26:06] could get in above this one here he's
[1:26:09] got to come in your mind first and you
[1:26:12] have to accept it so the fiery D comes
[1:26:15] in it's a little concept and Hy won't
[1:26:18] make it too outrageous just be
[1:26:21] believable all a sudden you start to
[1:26:24] reason you stopped that's where you went
[1:26:26] wrong you don't stop you have to deal
[1:26:29] with it straight away doesn't matter how
[1:26:32] good it sounds or feels to your flesh I
[1:26:35] wouldn't be led by my flesh cuz when it
[1:26:38] feels good in the flesh it's got to be
[1:26:39] it's not always good amen hey if it's
[1:26:42] food it's
[1:26:44] okay if it's Bri it's
[1:26:47] good no okay um so listen as mine first
[1:26:52] and you have to accept it listen it can
[1:26:55] batter against you but it can't get to
[1:26:58] you until you accept it when Satan
[1:27:01] walked up to Eve and said you know the
[1:27:03] fruit's pleasant she stopped for a
[1:27:05] moment oh that's when she made a mistake
[1:27:09] when she stopped for a moment don't stop
[1:27:12] for nothing you've got the message Jesus
[1:27:15] Lives God's A Healer that's the message
[1:27:18] don't stop for nothing no reasonings
[1:27:21] nothing else but she stopped for a
[1:27:23] moment that's when Satan walked right
[1:27:25] into that mind said well it sounds
[1:27:28] reasonable oh don't do that just take
[1:27:32] what God Said
[1:27:35] Amen take what he
[1:27:39] said slide six
[1:27:43] please and the
[1:27:46] next Ephesians 41:3 the whole Ephesians
[1:27:50] is just beautiful and we if you read
[1:27:53] that you'll read our journey that we're
[1:27:55] in we're sort of around verse 26 I think
[1:27:57] or you know right where it's all
[1:27:59] starting to work together where all the
[1:28:01] joints are supplying why because we have
[1:28:04] endeavored to keep the unity of the
[1:28:06] spirit in the bonds of Peace a church
[1:28:09] can have and will have those that are
[1:28:12] born of the spirit have got Unity but
[1:28:15] the devil can come in there and take the
[1:28:18] peace he can remove the peace he can
[1:28:20] bring fussing
[1:28:23] and even though you're born again can
[1:28:24] live down here like I said before below
[1:28:27] privilege or now because but the Lord's
[1:28:29] not going to allow us to live under
[1:28:31] there he's preparing a bride for a
[1:28:33] Rapture he's preparing a people to take
[1:28:34] them off the Earth he's not going to
[1:28:36] settle for us sitting down there he's
[1:28:38] going to he's going to brood over us
[1:28:41] amen he's going to rear us up and
[1:28:43] nurture us hallelujah so that we can
[1:28:46] come into our position amen so that our
[1:28:49] minds can come and be clear of all these
[1:28:51] things so that we can express the very
[1:28:54] Divine Expressions of God what is the
[1:28:57] greatest Divine expression of our age is
[1:28:59] a
[1:29:00] Rapture amen what a Divine expression
[1:29:02] he's going to bring us there you know
[1:29:05] being confident of this very thing that
[1:29:06] he which began a good work in you shall
[1:29:09] continue it unto the day of Jesus Christ
[1:29:12] you just remember back when you're under
[1:29:13] a barriage of fiery darts just remember
[1:29:16] back when he did that for you or he did
[1:29:19] this for you and you say get out of here
[1:29:21] devil get out in the name of Jesus
[1:29:24] Christ he has to listen he hates it he
[1:29:28] hates it when the church knows who she
[1:29:29] is he hates it when you realize that
[1:29:32] you've got authority over him you don't
[1:29:34] have to work it all up and get all Angry
[1:29:36] sometimes you do but you just have to he
[1:29:39] just has to listen to you
[1:29:43] amen I therefore the prisoner of the
[1:29:46] Lord I just thought that's key that he
[1:29:48] puts that in
[1:29:49] there this is this is this is liness and
[1:29:53] humility and it's the key absolute key
[1:29:58] for a harmonious Fellowship of human
[1:30:01] beings that are in these bodies born
[1:30:04] again but in these bodies in these
[1:30:07] Minds I therefore the prisoner of the
[1:30:09] Lord plead to you that all of you walk
[1:30:12] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[1:30:14] called with all loneliness and
[1:30:18] meekness with
[1:30:20] longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:30:23] that word forbearing is to put up with
[1:30:26] you got to put up with each other we got
[1:30:27] to put up with our Humanity put up with
[1:30:30] failures put up with mistakes put up
[1:30:32] with with maybe someone says the wrong
[1:30:34] thing sometimes you know they're having
[1:30:36] a bad day or or maybe they didn't really
[1:30:38] mean it the devil will actually magnify
[1:30:41] it you know and and really in all cases
[1:30:44] we have to give the benefit of the doubt
[1:30:46] if you don't give the benefit of the
[1:30:47] doubt you're going to just go right down
[1:30:49] a spiral of bitterness and crit ISM and
[1:30:52] critical a critical spirit forbearing
[1:30:56] one another in love amen hallelujah you
[1:30:59] know when you have when you're in a a
[1:31:02] family situation and you you you know
[1:31:05] all the faults and you know all the
[1:31:07] issues and and and things can annoy you
[1:31:09] but to have a harmonious sibling you
[1:31:12] know like group you have to forbear each
[1:31:15] other you just have to you know the
[1:31:17] closer you are you forbear each other
[1:31:20] you and and so here now say here
[1:31:24] endeavoring that is with all that's
[1:31:26] within you to keep the unity of the
[1:31:29] spirit in the bond of Peace because now
[1:31:32] in this atmosphere he's painting this
[1:31:34] picture here because now if you read
[1:31:36] Ephesians 4 which you should um you'll
[1:31:38] see him unfold the very Journey that the
[1:31:42] church takes right up into the full
[1:31:45] image of Christ right up until she leads
[1:31:47] the Earth
[1:31:49] Hallelujah this very Ephesians Amen
[1:31:52] brother brandom said we are in our
[1:31:54] Ephesians amen what is Ephesians what is
[1:31:56] the whole it's coming out of the
[1:31:58] Wilderness and into the promised land
[1:32:00] and being given your
[1:32:01] inheritance hallelujah we're in the age
[1:32:04] where all of our inheritance has been
[1:32:06] bequeathed through our Joshua brother
[1:32:08] brandham he's bequeathed it all to us
[1:32:11] but to be able to take possession of
[1:32:15] these things there needs to be there's
[1:32:18] all these enemies in our own life that
[1:32:21] needs to be
[1:32:23] overcome and now the Lord Has Come
[1:32:25] himself into our very life personally to
[1:32:29] us to subdue all the enemies in our
[1:32:31] lives amen amen to give us our
[1:32:34] inheritance little by little as we
[1:32:36] mature in the
[1:32:38] Lord as we mature and have the maturity
[1:32:42] to handle the power of
[1:32:46] Freedom the power of
[1:32:48] Freedom you see when you're completely
[1:32:50] free and there's no things blocking you
[1:32:54] you'll be a manifested Son of God
[1:32:55] speaking words into existence if you
[1:32:57] need to fully free fully in everything
[1:33:01] that God's given you and there's nothing
[1:33:03] to hold you back but do you have the
[1:33:06] character to handle that at the moment
[1:33:08] could you handle that we all say amen
[1:33:12] amen but the Lord
[1:33:13] knows he knows just well amen and so
[1:33:17] little by little he will drive out all
[1:33:19] these things out of our life little by
[1:33:21] little he'll clear that channel little
[1:33:23] by little he'll remove that complex
[1:33:25] little by little he'll remove that scar
[1:33:27] that's down deep in your spirit that you
[1:33:29] don't even know it's there and you
[1:33:31] wonder why you you you're affected by
[1:33:33] certain circumstances and and it and it
[1:33:35] breaks you or it makes you excited and
[1:33:38] in ways you don't want to be excited or
[1:33:40] whatever it may be you wonder these
[1:33:42] things but the Lord eventually as you
[1:33:47] unfold your petals to the
[1:33:49] sunlight just eventually it starts to
[1:33:51] deal with you and starts to wash you
[1:33:53] starts to turn the water into wine and
[1:33:55] and you start to become free you know
[1:33:58] he's really at the moment we're we're
[1:34:01] stuck on we're we're right involved with
[1:34:05] this world but very shortly very soon
[1:34:08] you know the the Lord's going to allow
[1:34:10] the devil to squeeze us right off the
[1:34:12] tree of knowledge right out of the
[1:34:14] dependency on money and dependency on
[1:34:16] society so that we're 100% dependent on
[1:34:19] him but because we are dependent on
[1:34:21] society it affects us we're out there
[1:34:25] we're doing things that interact we're
[1:34:27] interacting with these people we're
[1:34:28] being affected and our
[1:34:32] thoughts being affected by all these
[1:34:34] things
[1:34:35] amen but one
[1:34:38] day we will be free completely from
[1:34:42] those things Hallelujah so here now for
[1:34:46] us in the fellowship because it's so
[1:34:50] important as brother said you're all one

[1:35:05] bitterness he wants to take the unity of
[1:35:07] the spirit out of the bonds of peace and
[1:35:10] make a fighting family with baggage and
[1:35:12] problems and people leaving and when
[1:35:14] people come in they don't they feel oh
[1:35:16] this is not a very good atmosphere
[1:35:17] what's wrong what ministers come through

[1:37:05] going even anything to be thoughts of
[1:37:08] unbelief the thoughts wondering about
[1:37:11] stuff as soon as it's contrary to the
[1:37:13] word in the slightest way in the name of
[1:37:16] Jesus Christ I cast you out Satan gone
[1:37:19] changes I've been through many
[1:37:22] many and this changes things very fast
[1:37:26] he must listen but now this is the this
[1:37:29] is that's that's rarely the Crux of our
[1:37:31] Victory now says to him them that
[1:37:34] received him Jesus Christ gave he power
[1:37:37] and authority to become the sons of God
[1:37:39] to to to stand your ground amen
[1:37:42] hallelujah to to hold and stand fast in
[1:37:45] the Liberty where Christ has made us

[1:38:05] hydroponic amen we're raised in the
[1:38:08] planted by the rivers of Living Water
[1:38:09] you're on a good diet strong with
[1:38:12] vitamins hallelujah amen God can really
[1:38:15] use us amen he will use us as a group
[1:38:19] you know we are all always dealing with
[1:38:22] the
[1:38:23] individual but we don't really hear much
[1:38:25] about the group you see it takes because
[1:38:28] really God doesn't save a group but he
[1:38:30] saves a group of Saved
[1:38:33] individuals you know what I mean so when
[1:38:36] a group of Saved individuals who are
[1:38:37] walking in that place free from these
[1:38:40] things and have

[1:38:44] become a tool for God hallelujah

[1:38:55] as a group to do all sorts of things
[1:38:58] let's be open to the Lord for what he
[1:39:00] wants to do with us as a people that are
[1:39:03] individually free
[1:39:07] Hallelujah go to the next slide
[1:39:10] please here's an example of loneliness I
[1:39:12] just thought I'd put this in here it is
[1:39:14] in the greatest battle ever fought and
[1:39:16] it's the opening comment and I thought
[1:39:18] well well brother brandham doesn't he
[1:39:20] doesn't just
[1:39:21] there's always a reason for these
[1:39:23] opening comments that he makes in his
[1:39:24] sermons and you think oh he's just
[1:39:26] having a just you know talking to the
[1:39:28] people and sometimes he might be that
[1:39:30] many times there's some key things in
[1:39:32] there and this is one of them in the
[1:39:33] greatest battle ever fought which is
[1:39:36] basically sort of the lines I'm
[1:39:37] preaching on says here we have just come
[1:39:39] back couple of the trustees here at the
[1:39:41] church and myself was out in Arizona and
[1:39:44] we went out really to have a meeting at
[1:39:46] Phoenix with brother sheret at his
[1:39:48] Tabernacle but when I found out that a
[1:39:50] brother was in town having services in a
[1:39:52] tent well then I felt a little reluctant
[1:39:55] about holding a meeting I thought maybe
[1:39:56] I would have it on the Sunday afternoon
[1:39:59] so that no one would be bothered in
[1:40:00] their churches see this see this
[1:40:03] character he's not wanting to be like
[1:40:06] cuz he's the seventh Church age
[1:40:07] messenger man like the he's got this
[1:40:09] Mighty message that can that that's
[1:40:12] that's just so major like more just as
[1:40:14] major as Moses and all these great
[1:40:16] prophets and yet the character you know
[1:40:19] a lot of people will be like I'm the man
[1:40:22] everyone should stop for me you know the
[1:40:24] whole city should stop all the churches
[1:40:26] they they're better off coming to me you
[1:40:29] see this brother here he just wasn't
[1:40:31] like that wasn't like that it's such an
[1:40:33] example for us amen such an example
[1:40:36] doesn't matter how great you think you
[1:40:38] are or that you don't think you are God
[1:40:41] you know and this is character I think
[1:40:43] man it's amazing I thought maybe I would
[1:40:45] have it on the Sunday afternoon so that
[1:40:47] no one could be bothered in their
[1:40:48] churches but find out that he had Sunday
[1:40:50] afternoon services also and I was a
[1:40:52] little bit worried about having a
[1:40:54] service and so we Brethren instead of
[1:40:56] going on through the day as we were out
[1:40:58] hunting we went into the City and got
[1:41:00] ready and went to Brother Allen's
[1:41:02] Services brother AA Allen was having
[1:41:04] services so we went to the services and
[1:41:07] brother Allan preached a mighty sermon
[1:41:09] we had a good time listening to brother
[1:41:11] Allan hearing the singers and so forth
[1:41:13] how they sang and shouted and had a
[1:41:15] great service and then we seen all along
[1:41:18] the road the hand of the Lord where
[1:41:20] wherever we went the Lord Jesus would
[1:41:22] meet with us and there's something about
[1:41:24] being out to yourself out in the deserts
[1:41:27] man you know that's the result of
[1:41:29] loneliness and meekness loneliness and
[1:41:33] meekness that doesn't mean weak and like
[1:41:36] a jellyfish this is just a character
[1:41:40] preferring one another amen it's
[1:41:42] something that you know we can all grow
[1:41:44] in of course amen amen especially me I'm
[1:41:48] the chief chief grow need I I'm the
[1:41:51] chief of all un
[1:41:54] loneliness I need it amen but you see
[1:41:57] now the Lord is dealing with us dealing
[1:42:00] with us all and because he is dealing
[1:42:02] with us all
[1:42:04] forbearance and love is so important you
[1:42:07] know it's so important because that's to
[1:42:10] maintain the Harmony in the church to
[1:42:12] maintain that Spirit where we can end up
[1:42:16] in the vision of the Lord so while we're
[1:42:19] going there there is forbearance needed
[1:42:22] there is loneliness because you might
[1:42:24] have a great gift you might have a great
[1:42:27] anointing but to just go out there and
[1:42:30] try
[1:42:30] and be lonly the Lord the word of God
[1:42:34] does the plac thing the word of God
[1:42:36] don't be the opposite though and when
[1:42:38] he's calling or when he's moving you to
[1:42:41] do don't just be false humility now
[1:42:44] that's you know you got to find that
[1:42:46] balance and just let the Lord lead you
[1:42:48] and be and have courage step out in
[1:42:51] faith step out for the
[1:42:53] Lord these are all things it's all
[1:42:55] related to thoughts cuz
[1:42:58] see we have to discern now the motive
[1:43:01] and objective if God starts calling us
[1:43:04] to Something Search Your Heart what's
[1:43:07] your motive why do you want to do it
[1:43:09] what's in there what's the motive of
[1:43:10] that thought that's coming to
[1:43:13] you if it's to please people then bring
[1:43:17] it before the Lord but if it's to please
[1:43:19] the Lord and to bless people or to to to
[1:43:24] help it's just finding these motives and
[1:43:27] and you know I'm I'm guilty of bad
[1:43:29] motives and we're all guilty of bad
[1:43:31] motives you know like we've all had them
[1:43:32] and do them but as as you fail more you
[1:43:36] know you start to realize and the Lord
[1:43:38] starts to deal with you and operate
[1:43:40] deeply because those motives and
[1:43:42] objectives those really is the root of
[1:43:45] all of our
[1:43:47] actions amen let's just carry on here
[1:43:50] let's go to slide

[1:47:45] just them being
[1:47:47] ungrateful there was demon power
[1:47:51] attacking them making them doubt the
[1:47:54] Integrity of God making them think that
[1:47:56] Moses had just taking them out as a joke
[1:47:59] you know the devil was there firing the
[1:48:01] fiery darts into their minds because
[1:48:03] they didn't have any
[1:48:04] discernment they just believed it and
[1:48:06] became subject to every thought tossed
[1:48:10] about by every wind of
[1:48:11] Doctrine you know thinking that the
[1:48:14] baptism you know was just fruitless they
[1:48:17] should go back to Egypt and and and many
[1:48:20] people have gone back after being
[1:48:21] baptized because the devil just fires it
[1:48:23] all on
[1:48:24] them but fight through that doubt those
[1:48:27] doubts they're not even real they're
[1:48:29] just false it's just the devil what does
[1:48:32] the heart say you know and I've been I
[1:48:34] had nine months of unbelief when I first
[1:48:37] got saved just afterwards that I had to
[1:48:40] battle with and my heart believed the

[1:48:45] Warfare and I didn't understand it and I
[1:48:48] couldn't I didn't know what to do every
[1:48:51] time I stopped praying it was like a a

[1:48:59] driv me crazy but because in my heart I
[1:49:02] believed it but I didn't understand this
[1:49:05] that's why I love preaching us so much

[1:49:10] know about addressing the enemy I was
[1:49:12] just always Lord help me Lord help me
[1:49:14] and he was just allowing me to go
[1:49:16] through this for character development
[1:49:17] till finally I heard this sermon the
[1:49:19] greatest battle ever
[1:49:21] in there the prophet says that anything
[1:49:23] that ever comes to you that's contrary
[1:49:25] to the word is the devil and that

[1:55:08] thoughts of this whole sermon because
[1:55:10] it's so important now as we live in this
[1:55:12] world full of
[1:55:13] stimuli full of Satan's
[1:55:18] attacks that's what we call life now is
[1:55:21] only a shadow or a negative we all like
[1:55:23] to Rejoice but we can Rejoice over the
[1:55:26] right thing that shows that we're hooked
[1:55:28] up with the real thing when we Rejoice
[1:55:30] over the right thing but when we Rejoice
[1:55:33] over the wrong thing it shows we're
[1:55:35] hooked up with the wrong thing so our
[1:55:37] life can tell right now what we are
[1:55:40] which way our emotions are
[1:55:43] running I'll just repeat that so our
[1:55:45] life can tell right now what we are
[1:55:48] which way our emotions are running do
[1:55:51] you
[1:55:52] see if we're rejoicing over the world
[1:55:56] and the evil things our minds and our
[1:55:58] souls are inspired by below Boogie WGY
[1:56:02] rock and roll bgs all that sort of
[1:56:05] rubbish you know just music of the world
[1:56:07] anything that's not given by God is is
[1:56:10] in here basically very very very few
[1:56:13] artists are not inspired by Satan that
[1:56:14] AR inspired by God actually you can
[1:56:16] either be inspired by one or the other
[1:56:19] there's no middle
[1:56:21] ground Boogie wogie dances heartaches
[1:56:23] drinking and all these other things that
[1:56:25] we run after it's from below but if we
[1:56:29] rejoice in the spirit that we have
[1:56:31] eternal life and we raise our emotions
[1:56:34] to God Amen do you raise your emotions
[1:56:37] to God when you worship are you feeling
[1:56:41] love towards God are you you got an
[1:56:44] emotion about it are you emotional to
[1:56:46] your king does he make you cry with joy
[1:56:51] not that you have to cry not you know
[1:56:52] everyone's built differently but but are
[1:56:55] you is it just a a feelingless thing
[1:56:57] that you're doing as a as a Duty or is
[1:57:00] it something you feel is if it's just a
[1:57:03] Duty or if you're just struggling with
[1:57:04] it there's a channel blocked this
[1:57:06] morning can be cleared amen right here
[1:57:09] amen hallelujah right now amen
[1:57:14] hallelujah we raise our emotions to God
[1:57:17] and praise him then we have have
[1:57:20] joy then we have joy Jesus said I that
[1:57:24] your Joys might be full see he's the
[1:57:26] creator of Joy he's the creator of
[1:57:29] Serotonin and dopamine and all those
[1:57:31] chemicals that make you feel happy he's
[1:57:34] the creator of this body he wants your
[1:57:37] spirit he wants your spirit to be so
[1:57:40] clean and so healed so that it can
[1:57:43] produce the right chemicals in your
[1:57:45] body you can be with natural
[1:57:48] affection you don't have to take drugs
[1:57:50] to feel happy you don't have to take
[1:57:52] drugs to to feel free because your
[1:57:55] spirit is healed he doesn't he wants to
[1:57:58] deal deep down heal those things
[1:58:01] hallelujah amen it says earlier way
[1:58:04] earlier don't overlook these things
[1:58:06] don't overlook thoughts in the whole
[1:58:08] thing just remember
[1:58:13] now he's the creator of
[1:58:16] Joy amen you know he went to Calvary
[1:58:19] because he he saw us we the joy that was
[1:58:22] set before
[1:58:23] him now he's turning that because see he
[1:58:27] wanted it back he didn't just want to be
[1:58:29] the joy he didn't just want us to be the
[1:58:30] joy he wanted to become the joy that set
[1:58:33] before us he wanted to be he he wants it
[1:58:36] to be the reason why we take up our
[1:58:38] cross why we sacrifice our life for the
[1:58:41] king because he's the joy that is set
[1:58:43] before us you know he's the he's the
[1:58:46] underlying overlying every Ling motive
[1:58:49] you know man in every part of our Lives
[1:58:52] the the principal theme of our
[1:58:55] life The Joy set before
[1:58:58] us it
[1:59:01] depends but not full of the perverted
[1:59:04] life but full of eternal life above so
[1:59:08] you can see it depends on what you look
[1:59:10] at now just for an instance for the
[1:59:13] psychology part of
[1:59:16] it
[1:59:18] psychology the the prophet said it you
[1:59:20] know there's a lot of people are a bit
[1:59:22] funny about psychology you know but the
[1:59:24] there is a psych there's a truth to
[1:59:26] psychology there's a truth to it it's
[1:59:29] not just all mind of man God has
[1:59:32] psychology he created the mind he
[1:59:34] created all these things he created
[1:59:35] feelings he created the spirit now he
[1:59:37] wants to give us an understanding of the
[1:59:39] very spirit that we're to take control
[1:59:41] over now before I go any further I want
[1:59:44] to show you that when your soul is in
[1:59:48] harmony with God
[1:59:49] when your soul is placed and God is at
[1:59:52] the head of you your spirit will
[1:59:54] eventually come into
[1:59:56] subjection your spirit will eventually
[1:59:58] be all healed it'll eventually be all
[2:00:01] cleared out eventually because this is
[2:00:03] the age where he's doing everything
[2:00:05] other ages gone by we can't we don't
[2:00:08] have anything to say they had their day
[2:00:10] they had their light they had their
[2:00:11] revivals but in the end time it's time
[2:00:14] to clear the title it's time to clear
[2:00:16] everything because the church is going
[2:00:18] to come to her perfect place so because
[2:00:22] of that he has to clear all these things
[2:00:24] so now he raises the soul of man back
[2:00:27] into its position then the spirit of man
[2:00:31] starts to come clean starts to all clean
[2:00:34] out starts to all become in harmony now
[2:00:38] the body because the spirit now is
[2:00:41] responsible for producing the right
[2:00:43] chemicals in the body the spirit is
[2:00:45] responsible for the chemical reactions
[2:00:48] thank you brother
[2:00:49] for the chemical reactions in the
[2:00:52] body the spirit now when based on what
[2:00:56] you're seeing based on what's happening
[2:00:58] around you based on the circumstance in
[2:01:00] this room based on you're in you you
[2:01:02] might be in a in a in somewhere I don't
[2:01:05] know like in a in a circumstance where
[2:01:08] it's a it's a different situation and
[2:01:10] you're sitting there and you're
[2:01:11] wondering deep down this it's just
[2:01:13] troubled and everyone else is just
[2:01:15] sitting normal and you're troubled and
[2:01:17] you don't know what it is I can tell you
[2:01:20] I don't know what it would be because
[2:01:21] this is all hypothetical but there will
[2:01:23] be a breach in your spirit deep deep
[2:01:25] deep down and it's and it's something
[2:01:28] that's happened to you or something
[2:01:29] you've inherited that's in there and you
[2:01:31] react differently to the situation than
[2:01:33] other people might and that needs to be
[2:01:36] dealt with so what's happening is that
[2:01:38] little breach in there is pouring out
[2:01:41] adrenaline into your body and your body
[2:01:44] feels adrenaline and you feel start
[2:01:46] shaking and you start and you wonder
[2:01:48] what's going on you physically feeling
[2:01:50] something here and you're sitting in the
[2:01:51] situation you think you're weird you're
[2:01:54] wondering what's going
[2:01:55] on your spirit is producing these kles
[2:01:59] for for no reason seemingly but
[2:02:01] Something's Happened deep down and it
[2:02:04] needs to be dealt
[2:02:05] with that's like an Aaron's rod and it
[2:02:09] needs to come into the shakina it needs
[2:02:11] to come and kneel down before the Lord
[2:02:14] and that shakina will start to brood
[2:02:15] over you and bring healing right there
[2:02:19] Hallelujah you might just be kneeling
[2:02:21] down you might be just washing the
[2:02:22] dishes one morning one night putting the
[2:02:25] dishwasher in and all of a sudden Boom
[2:02:28] the Lord is there boom that's what it is
[2:02:31] cuz you're walking with him you're
[2:02:33] walking with God he's dealing with all
[2:02:36] these issues he's dealing with all of
[2:02:38] these things so now he wants to throw
[2:02:41] your body into
[2:02:43] balance he wants to throw this physical
[2:02:45] body now into balance so that we when
[2:02:49] you are in this situation it reacts
[2:02:51] Godly so that when you're in this
[2:02:53] situation it reacts Godly it reacts in a
[2:02:56] certain way it's balanced you know and I
[2:02:59] remember before I was a Christian and
[2:03:01] all of that I needed to take drugs I
[2:03:03] needed to take substances to feel
[2:03:07] balanced I don't know I don't know why I
[2:03:09] was raised normal everything I guess I
[2:03:12] mean every every parent has their issues
[2:03:13] and stuff especially in the world you
[2:03:15] know
[2:03:17] but I just felt like what is what's the
[2:03:20] point of life if you needed take all
[2:03:21] this stuff to feel happy or not that I
[2:03:23] didn't feel happy but I wanted to always
[2:03:25] feel really happy you know I wanted to
[2:03:27] be really in you know like really
[2:03:29] completely intense and like partying and
[2:03:32] just going
[2:03:33] hard hey you know and it's it's just now
[2:03:37] because see because of that there was a
[2:03:40] imbalance my spirit was having all sorts
[2:03:43] of troubles so it was not producing the
[2:03:46] right chemicals all the time but I came
[2:03:47] in connection with the the very creator
[2:03:50] of this Spirit of this body and so now
[2:03:53] my soul gets placed in its position now
[2:03:55] the spirit comes into Health the spirit
[2:03:58] comes into Harmony and now she starts to
[2:04:00] keep the home well she starts to look
[2:04:03] after the house she feels happy she can
[2:04:07] communicate with people she's not
[2:04:09] feeling withdrawn from a
[2:04:11] situation she can raise her hands in
[2:04:14] church now she's healthy she's got a
[2:04:17] good headship amen amen hallelujah the
[2:04:21] soul is in communion with God the wife
[2:04:23] comes into subjection the house is
[2:04:26] kept
[2:04:28] hallelujah amen that's not just a
[2:04:30] natural this is the spiritual in our
[2:04:32] life the soul is the husband the spirit
[2:04:36] is the wife and the house is the
[2:04:38] body and now there's Harmony now you
[2:04:41] feel balanced and I remember when I met
[2:04:44] the Lord for the first time in my life I
[2:04:47] just felt balanced you know I just felt
[2:04:48] like I'm content just content without
[2:04:52] substance
[2:04:54] hallelujah amen but always there's a
[2:04:57] longing there's a deep calling to the
[2:04:59] deep but now there's a there's a real
[2:05:02] deep to answer to that it's not some
[2:05:03] chemical that Satan made in a lab but
[2:05:05] it's God himself The Giver of Joy
[2:05:09] Hallelujah so my emotions now have been
[2:05:12] turned towards the the the king turn
[2:05:14] towards that deep Hallelujah to that's
[2:05:18] going to draw my heart out to him it's
[2:05:20] going to draw me it's going to give me a
[2:05:22] jubilee from all this hallelujah it's
[2:05:25] going to give me a Rapture amen amen
[2:05:28] hallelujah let's move um hold on still
[2:05:31] got a bit to read on here so now now
[2:05:34] just for instance for the psychology
[2:05:35] part of it psychiatric now let's notice
[2:05:38] just a moment this psychic view here is
[2:05:42] the picture of Christ and here is an
[2:05:45] electric fan two pictures it depends I
[2:05:49] think he's got it in his church maybe
[2:05:51] he's pointing to them
[2:05:56] says it depends on which one I look at
[2:05:59] see if my emotions is moved this way or
[2:06:02] if my emotions is moved this
[2:06:06] way if I look at that and long for that
[2:06:10] and desire
[2:06:13] that my emotions are set towards the fan
[2:06:17] but if I look this way and my desire is
[2:06:20] set that way that's the reason Jesus
[2:06:23] said whosoever lookth upon a woman to
[2:06:26] lust after her has committed adultery
[2:06:28] with her already in his heart see it's
[2:06:31] where your emotions is
[2:06:33] set where your thoughts is next slide
[2:06:37] next yep if ye then be risen with Christ
[2:06:41] seek those things which are above where
[2:06:44] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[2:06:47] your affection on things above not on
[2:06:51] things on the earth and I've written
[2:06:53] there set your emotions right for what
[2:06:55] do we covet what are we looking after
[2:06:58] what does the devil do he sends you
[2:07:00] flyers and brochures all the time
[2:07:01] barrages your mailbox what is he doing
[2:07:04] to you you're reading through it you
[2:07:06] don't really need the stuff but you're
[2:07:08] reading and I do it I read through it
[2:07:09] thinking it might stimulate something
[2:07:11] that I need you know I might have
[2:07:13] forgotten something and I want and so
[2:07:14] you just start thinking in these things
[2:07:16] and you wonder why you start getting
[2:07:18] lust problems you wonder why you start
[2:07:20] getting Covetous cuz now you're wanting
[2:07:22] things that you don't have all the time
[2:07:24] you're setting your emotions on things
[2:07:25] that you don't have you're setting your
[2:07:27] emotion on things that you don't need
[2:07:29] your your emotions start to become
[2:07:32] covetousness it's bad we we want to be
[2:07:36] content you know and when God gives us a
[2:07:39] need hey we got to be balanced of course
[2:07:42] you know when you see that Ferrari drive
[2:07:45] past you go man that's the nice car I'll
[2:07:48] never have
[2:07:50] it amen I'm sure you know we don't want
[2:07:53] to be robots or anything but but there
[2:07:55] is a but to cover say if you you become
[2:07:58] a fixed on it you know and you and
[2:08:00] you're always oh man I wish I had one of
[2:08:02] those and your your emotions are set
[2:08:04] towards it you're going to start drawing
[2:08:06] towards covetousness you're going to
[2:08:07] start drawing towards things that you
[2:08:08] can't
[2:08:09] have and it all links together there
[2:08:12] scriptures in James it says it actually
[2:08:13] starts to lead to U like complete real
[2:08:17] bad you if you start getting Covetous
[2:08:19] for things so transfers not just to like
[2:08:23] inanimate objects and things it
[2:08:25] transfers to wives of neighbors and all
[2:08:28] sorts of things you can just it it it's
[2:08:30] covetousness is all linked together it's
[2:08:32] not just like things that are not you
[2:08:35] know like just standard items it leads
[2:08:37] into Contraband and things that are
[2:08:39] actually evil and detrimental to your
[2:08:41] soul so set your affections on things
[2:08:44] above not on things of the earth set
[2:08:47] your affections on Christ set your
[2:08:49] affections on what he's done for you set
[2:08:51] your affections on this message that
[2:08:53] he's given you to transform you to make
[2:08:55] you Rapture Ready to clothe you in the
[2:08:57] wedding garments Hallelujah that higy
[2:09:00] has has has given you the recipe so that
[2:09:03] when you walk before the king you are
[2:09:05] the reflection of the king Hallelujah
[2:09:08] set your affections on things above not
[2:09:11] on things of the earth you will keep him
[2:09:13] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[2:09:16] you because he trusts in you you trust
[2:09:19] all of you in the Lord forever for the
[2:09:21] Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength God
[2:09:24] give me strength hallelujah amen and now
[2:09:28] I've
[2:09:31] got we're nearly we're nearly
[2:09:35] closing few more
[2:09:38] slides hell is gearing up for a great
[2:09:41] onslaught of fiery darts and suen
[2:09:44] attempt to crush the bride and either
[2:09:48] keep her or place her in
[2:09:51] stalemate
[2:09:53] individually in
[2:09:55] family
[2:09:57] locally nationally and
[2:10:01] internationally he's they're gearing
[2:10:03] up we are the
[2:10:08] supernatural bride of Jesus Christ the
[2:10:11] the mystical Body of
[2:10:13] Christ that's us and we have a vision
[2:10:18] and the Lord has a purpose for each one
[2:10:20] of us amen and now there's coming a
[2:10:23] great
[2:10:24] attack a huge
[2:10:26] attack on the bride to crush her down
[2:10:30] but I'm standing before the provision
[2:10:32] that's going that's an exodus from these
[2:10:34] things and we as a group God has called
[2:10:38] us to do great
[2:10:39] things we're going to stand still and
[2:10:41] see the salvation of the Lord I'm
[2:10:44] looking at the arm of the Lord that's
[2:10:47] why he wants to clear your mind and give
[2:10:48] you discernment so that we can remain in
[2:10:50] this atmosphere he wants us to remain in
[2:10:53] this atmosphere and unlike any other age
[2:10:55] even in the message now because you know
[2:10:58] and I know that there's many message
[2:11:00] churches that are that are crippled that
[2:11:02] are that have been stalemated because of
[2:11:04] thoughts they didn't understand maybe I
[2:11:06] don't know but maybe now it's the
[2:11:08] program that churches have to come into
[2:11:10] an exodus of that it's come a time now
[2:11:14] where the church is made of individuals
[2:11:16] are coming out of that thing and they
[2:11:18] coming into and they're going to
[2:11:19] maintain a liberty am maintain Jubilee
[2:11:23] walking not on a plateau but walking up
[2:11:27] Hallelujah sometimes I feel like I'm
[2:11:29] going up amen hallelujah sometimes I
[2:11:31] feel like Heaven's come down amen so
[2:11:34] we're going right up everything that the
[2:11:36] first church went down from and left the
[2:11:38] first love and and had false Apostles
[2:11:40] coming in and all these things going on
[2:11:43] but finally now the very opposite is
[2:11:45] happening and we're walking right into
[2:11:47] our first love walking right into the
[2:11:50] very thing that has been prophesied over
[2:11:52] the church for 2,000 years 6,000 years
[2:11:54] being in the back part of God's mind
[2:11:56] preached by a prophet in 1963 he says
[2:11:59] I'm going to reach into the back part of
[2:12:00] God's mind and deliver to you what was
[2:12:03] in there that's the great Secret Of God
[2:12:07] who says that that's glorious some major
[2:12:11] things going on and so now we're coming
[2:12:14] into these things we are our beneficiary
[2:12:17] we become the arm of the Lord as a group
[2:12:20] now under that Divine Captain to free
[2:12:23] Rahab from his prison to free rabs all
[2:12:26] over the country from prisons to be an
[2:12:30] outreaching church with a vision am with
[2:12:33] Minds that are set on Christ with
[2:12:36] affections that are set on things above
[2:12:38] with dedication Men of
[2:12:41] Valor woman of
[2:12:43] Faith
[2:12:44] Hallelujah like David whenever a Goliath
[2:12:48] comes there's no way we're going to sit
[2:12:50] there and be scared hallelujah we're
[2:12:52] going to stand together amen because now
[2:12:56] there's discernment when a Goliath comes
[2:12:58] and sits in the middle you just draw
[2:13:01] that much closer together amen
[2:13:04] hallelujah draw closer together and
[2:13:07] eventually they'll either be converted
[2:13:09] or they'll leave amen hallelujah you
[2:13:12] just do that amen you always trust your
[2:13:15] pastor cuz God's called him and anointed
[2:13:17] him him to to lead through these things
[2:13:20] Hallelujah serious and we will face
[2:13:23] these battles he will not leave us alone
[2:13:26] and neither will the Lord forsake us

[2:14:37] instrumentation is the complete
[2:14:39] degradation of the world being
[2:14:41] manifested through that all the things
[2:14:44] that you can see the Bible says it she's
[2:14:46] the mother of all the minations and
[2:14:49] mother of harlots or religion doesn't

[2:15:31] I hope not but if we are you've got to
[2:15:35] wonder why you're troubled with your
[2:15:36] thoughts you got to wonder why you're
[2:15:38] not walking in the victory because
[2:15:39] you're supporting the
[2:15:41] devil and it's time to clean out the
[2:15:43] leaven it's time to eradicate that stuff
[2:15:46] out of your life amen it's time to take
[2:15:50] the Feast of unleavened bread amen it's
[2:15:53] time to Feast only on things that are
[2:15:55] unleavened amen stop feasting on leaven
[2:15:59] you know leaven bread tastes good and it
[2:16:01] grows
[2:16:03] more but it's got Liv in it
[2:16:08] amen so here we have this is my
[2:16:12] finishing preaching thought and then the
[2:16:13] rest I've just got a couple more quotes
[2:16:14] to
[2:16:15] read Daniel 3
[2:16:20] so here we have the original
[2:16:22] Babylon and this
[2:16:25] Nebuchadnezzar and the original Babylon
[2:16:28] and that's Satan where Satan was and his
[2:16:30] kingdom and and expressing over the
[2:16:32] Earth and all of his pantheons and gods
[2:16:35] and everything like that in
[2:16:36] debauchery and here is Nebuchadnezzar
[2:16:40] and then finally he calls all the Great
[2:16:42] Men of the Earth the Great Men of his
[2:16:44] kingdom all the sheriffs and all the
[2:16:46] governors and all the presidents and and
[2:16:49] the Bohemian groups and all of those
[2:16:51] Illuminati type people the ones that
[2:16:54] worship Satan and their leaders of the
[2:16:55] world all those he gathers them all and
[2:16:58] they make this big golden
[2:17:01] image finally there they're building
[2:17:04] this big huge
[2:17:05] image in
[2:17:07] Dura it's 60 feet high and 6 feet wide
[2:17:12] or whatever
[2:17:13] meters it's big image and they got now
[2:17:17] he calls them all together and how do
[2:17:19] they get the people to worship this
[2:17:22] what's going to turn their hearts What
[2:17:25] Spirit or what medium do they use to to
[2:17:29] get the people to Fall Down and Worship
[2:17:31] this
[2:17:33] image
[2:17:35] music
[2:17:37] music is the tool of the devil that's
[2:17:41] also the tool of God but we're not
[2:17:42] dealing with that we're dealing with
[2:17:43] this music now is the principal tool of
[2:17:46] the devil to take the whole world turn
[2:17:49] them against God and worship this image
[2:17:53] that's right the spir brother Brandon
[2:17:55] said the spirit of rock and roll will
[2:17:57] take will turn the people from God and
[2:17:59] bring them to the battle of Armageddon
[2:18:01] I'm paraphrasing it might not be exactly
[2:18:03] how he says it but and then we see these
[2:18:06] big great concerts like G3 or whatever
[2:18:08] they're called you know the boner from
[2:18:10] U2 and all of that and all the religions
[2:18:11] and they pour water and all this
[2:18:13] jellyfish rubbish you know they're doing
[2:18:15] all this crazy stuff rock and
[2:18:18] roll the Pop's there and all these
[2:18:20] things and they just doing all this
[2:18:23] ecumenical they're turning the whole
[2:18:25] world against God against what we
[2:18:29] believe and to their own
[2:18:32] God now there's a people now I believe
[2:18:36] I'm looking at them like Shadrach mesach
[2:18:39] and Abednego who who refuse to bow down
[2:18:42] to this image or worship those gods and
[2:18:44] completely will not listen to what the
[2:18:46] king nebuch NZ would say hallelujah now
[2:18:51] why would that happen you see now that
[2:18:54] is the whole world now as music plays
[2:18:57] and the music is going in people's ears
[2:18:59] and it's turning their minds and the
[2:19:01] spirits of it and it's turning them from
[2:19:03] God and it's turning them to this
[2:19:05] wishy-washy homosexual jellyfish Society
[2:19:09] where all things are all right and the
[2:19:11] only thing that's not all right is the
[2:19:13] what people that think they've got the
[2:19:15] absolute truth the
[2:19:16] fundamentalist so they actually defeat
[2:19:18] their own cuz they should say that we're
[2:19:20] all right too cuz they said all things
[2:19:22] are all right so you should be allowed
[2:19:23] to be a fundamentalist but they just but
[2:19:25] the thing is it's a spirit and Satan
[2:19:27] cannot be complete so here's all of this
[2:19:30] music playing people bowing down but
[2:19:32] there's a people that resist that music
[2:19:34] there's a people that kick that music
[2:19:36] out there's a people that remove it from
[2:19:38] their lives hallelujah amen remove that
[2:19:40] television stuff and get rid of all
[2:19:43] disconnected from Hollywood disconnected
[2:19:46] from all books and anything that's of
[2:19:48] the
[2:19:49] devil and only
[2:19:51] connected three times daily as Daniel
[2:19:53] open a window and pray to the Living God
[2:19:55] towards the temple set affections on
[2:19:58] things above amen Who Wants to Be Free
[2:20:02] set your affections on things above amen
[2:20:04] not on things of the earth hallelujah
[2:20:08] amen and so now they now they come
[2:20:10] before the king and he gets pretty mad
[2:20:12] amen and so what happens is in the
[2:20:14] society they heat up seven times hotter
[2:20:16] but I tell tell you God's given us a
[2:20:19] seven seal Revelation to combat that the
[2:20:23] seventh seal himself so and now that the
[2:20:25] furnace is seven times hotter Hallelujah
[2:20:28] and they walk in Bound Hallelujah they
[2:20:32] walk in Bound in this furnace amen and
[2:20:35] and we're living in this furnace and we
[2:20:37] come to it bound but then one day
[2:20:40] Hallelujah the Fire gets seven times
[2:20:42] hotter when you refuse what happens
[2:20:45] Hallelujah those trials start to bre
[2:20:47] bring out all that stuff in you bring
[2:20:49] out all those complexes in you bring out
[2:20:51] why and you start to get delivered from
[2:20:53] them all the fire at self breaks the
[2:20:56] bands and you stand Hallelujah walking
[2:20:58] around in the midst of the fire free
[2:21:01] from the effects of the fire why because
[2:21:03] a descended Mighty angel came down
[2:21:05] hallelujah amen to walk with you amen
[2:21:09] for those that take a stand against
[2:21:11] Nebuchadnezzar's lies against
[2:21:13] Nebuchadnezzar's denominational image
[2:21:15] for those that take a stand he will be
[2:21:17] angry angry the devil will be mad and he
[2:21:19] will try everything that hell can do he
[2:21:21] will heat it up seven times hotter and
[2:21:23] make it really hard for
[2:21:25] you my goodness it make it so hard for
[2:21:28] you but that's the very thing that sets
[2:21:30] you free those trials and that hardship
[2:21:33] will bring every disgusting thing out of
[2:21:35] your life every hideous thing that's
[2:21:37] been hidden down in there every bruise
[2:21:39] everything will be
[2:21:40] exposed because the Lord himself comes
[2:21:43] down and he puts a leash on the very
[2:21:46] fire
[2:21:47] that Satan has decided to burn you with
[2:21:52] Hallelujah so to such an effect that you
[2:21:55] can be surrounded by this horrible fiery
[2:21:58] sinful sin and world and not even smell
[2:22:02] like it Hallelujah not even smell like
[2:22:06] it amen and they Marvel at it these
[2:22:09] churches and these people they Marvel at
[2:22:11] you they Wonder but they don't want what
[2:22:14] you got cuz they're already worshiping
[2:22:16] the golden image they're already
[2:22:18] listening to their rock and roll it's
[2:22:19] even in the
[2:22:20] churches the whole thing is complete
[2:22:22] debauchery it's gone finished
[2:22:26] unsavable the only way is to come out of
[2:22:29] that
[2:22:30] stuff my goodness so finally they come
[2:22:33] out you don't even smell like it
[2:22:36] Hallelujah the Lord himself is to come
[2:22:38] down because you see now when we look at
[2:22:40] fire we think of the Flesh and all that
[2:22:42] but it's the Mind see the fire is coming
[2:22:45] with the fiery darts so many of them
[2:22:47] that it's like a seven times hot of

[2:23:02] affected by those things anymore that's
[2:23:04] the main thing you can have in your life
[2:23:07] that is the message of the hour is the
[2:23:09] very being coming down into your furnace
[2:23:11] the very person setting his feet upon
[2:23:14] the sea and upon the Earth of your life
[2:23:16] Hallelujah
[2:23:17] so that all the thoughts and all the
[2:23:19] fiery darts and everything that he could
[2:23:21] ever throw you none of these things move
[2:23:23] me Hallelujah you've been stabilized by
[2:23:26] the gyroscopic stabilization the seas
[2:23:29] are perilous and you're rocking in this
[2:23:31] 15 meter swells and you're standing with
[2:23:33] the Lord amen in the fiery
[2:23:36] furnace
[2:23:39] glory
[2:23:41] amen oh man that makes me feel good can
[2:23:43] you go to the next slide please I'll
[2:23:44] just read some Hallelujah
[2:23:49] oh my
[2:23:51] my yep I'll read this I was going to
[2:23:54] skip it but I think we should read it
[2:23:55] but after you become a Christian then
[2:23:58] you are fortified by the word and any
[2:24:00] promise in the word pH I didn't know I
[2:24:04] was going to say that see I'll just
[2:24:07] repeat that's such a good thought when
[2:24:10] you become a Christian then you are
[2:24:12] fortified by the word and any promise in
[2:24:16] the word isn't that amazing what does
[2:24:18] your heart say yes the Mind might be
[2:24:21] doubting even now there might be doubts
[2:24:23] flying it's not for you or you might not
[2:24:25] have access to it but the heart believes
[2:24:27] it and when you need it God will bring
[2:24:30] it hallelujah amen doubt your doubts
[2:24:33] when you become a Christian you're
[2:24:35] placed behind the word of God see now
[2:24:37] there's your Fortress safety oh my every
[2:24:39] promise in that is yours only thing you
[2:24:42] have to do is just reach to get it and
[2:24:45] go right on with it how do you know it's
[2:24:47] going to work I don't know how it's
[2:24:50] going to work explain to me I don't know
[2:24:53] the only thing I know that God gave his
[2:24:56] children the best attack that they could
[2:24:58] have and the best thing to attack with
[2:25:01] cuz he knows the working of the enemy
[2:25:03] now let's diagnose that down like take
[2:25:06] the chemistry of the blood or the
[2:25:08] chemistry of water or whatever it is see
[2:25:10] let's diagnose it down why why did he
[2:25:13] give the word because are you ready the
[2:25:16] word is eternal see and if God made a
[2:25:19] promise that's Eternal and there's
[2:25:22] nothing nowhere can stop it they
[2:25:24] couldn't have turn every atom upside
[2:25:26] down turn it backwards could never
[2:25:27] pierce the word of God one little word
[2:25:30] see cuz Jesus said both heavens and
[2:25:32] earth will pass away but my word shall
[2:25:34] never fail see see that's the best
[2:25:38] weapon there is it's the word of the
[2:25:41] Eternal God now what is the word of God
[2:25:44] the word of God is God himself so God
[2:25:48] gave the believer himself amen it's God
[2:25:52] himself he gave the believer himself to
[2:25:56] attack the Enemy by that's what we just
[2:25:58] s talked about in the fire that's what
[2:26:00] we talked about when they came over
[2:26:01] Jordan is the captain
[2:26:04] hallelujah it's the Lord himself it's
[2:26:07] Revelation 10 coming down with an open
[2:26:09] book it's
[2:26:11] himself Hallelujah he gave the fullness
[2:26:14] of the word the revelation of the word
[2:26:16] and he came himself himself to make it
[2:26:17] manifest in other words he is the father
[2:26:21] and the word is God then the word is our
[2:26:24] father we're born by the word and he's
[2:26:26] standing in the Forefront for his
[2:26:28] children amen there you are he's
[2:26:31] standing out there for his children what
[2:26:33] are we scared about the Rapture is sure
[2:26:35] the coming is sure every blessing that's
[2:26:37] been promised is ours all belongs to us
[2:26:40] got from behind the now we kind of slack
[2:26:42] up and say now if we kind of slack up
[2:26:44] and say Satan say come right over on
[2:26:47] this side I'll reason that out with you
[2:26:50] oh no you got from behind father then

[2:26:56] where father stands right where it stand
[2:27:00] and says thus sayith father see thus
[2:27:02] sayith my father thus saith my father
[2:27:05] it's going to defeat him as sure as the
[2:27:07] world it's got to all right but when you
[2:27:10] get out from behind that like Eve did
[2:27:12] The battle's Lost next slide
