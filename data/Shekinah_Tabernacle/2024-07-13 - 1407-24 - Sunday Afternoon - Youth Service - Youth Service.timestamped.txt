[28:22] word uh Lord heavenly father I thank you
[28:24] Lord for this time we have together Lord

[28:36] blessing to God's people Lord I Thank
[28:38] you Lord for the opportunity obviously
[28:40] and um want to do my due diligence name
[28:43] of Lord Jesus Christ amen am amen um
[28:47] yeah so before before we sit down so
[28:49] Matthew chapter 6 uh 26 verse
[28:55] 30 um just make sure I have it my
[29:06] s and when they had sung A Hymn they
[29:09] went out into the Mount of Olives and
[29:12] then sath Jesus unto them all ye shall
[29:16] be offended because of me this night for
[29:19] it is written I will Smite the shepherd
[29:22] and the sheep of the flock shall be
[29:24] scattered
[29:26] abroad but after I am risen again I will
[29:29] go before you into
[29:32] Galilee Peter answered and said unto the
[29:35] unto him though all men shall be
[29:38] offended because of thee yet will I
[29:41] never be offended and Jesus
[29:44] saith and Jesus said unto him verily I
[29:47] say unto thee that this night before the
[29:50] Crow thou shal deny me Thrice and
[29:54] Peter said unto him though I shall die
[29:57] with the thee yet will I not deny thee
[30:01] likewise also said all the
[30:05] disciples um May the Lord add His
[30:08] blessings to the r of his words you may
[30:09] be may be
[30:12] seated um so a couple of weeks ago or a
[30:15] week or so ago um Ben asked me if I'd
[30:17] take a service I um thought I had
[30:21] successfully dodged the question and not
[30:23] answered um but he's resilient and uh
[30:28] made sure I answered and uh here we are
[30:29] so you can blame Ben for me being here
[30:32] basically that's what I'm
[30:34] saying but no I um obviously suitably
[30:38] nervous and
[30:40] um as it should be when you're talking
[30:43] to God's people there's a certain
[30:44] reverence and a and a
[30:47] um type of care you take with it um so
[30:51] yeah
[30:54] um right let's start
[30:58] okay so apart from that being the first
[31:00] reading I want to now switch to a
[31:02] different story and it's actually in
[31:03] Matthew 25 so uh no you don't need don't
[31:08] need to turn to it sorry it is not
[31:10] Matthew 25 it is yeah it is Matthew 25
[31:14] there you go um story of the wise and
[31:16] foolish virgins now the story of the
[31:20] five five wise and five foolish virgins
[31:24] I'm hoping obviously the kids know I'm
[31:27] saying kids sor sorry anyone under
[31:29] 20 um knows the basic story of the um
[31:33] five wise and five
[31:35] foolish do we cool sweet you can tell me
[31:38] it then right so if I if we sort of just
[31:41] there's a group of them over here
[31:43] there's a few hiding over this side but
[31:45] um if I just sort of point to you I'm
[31:48] nervous already and I forget names as it
[31:50] is so don't get offended but if I point
[31:52] to you how about we start running
[31:54] through the the five wise and five
[31:56] fullest versions all right we good we
[32:00] good no you're not looking at me so what
[32:03] we'll
[32:03] [Laughter]

[32:43] the
[32:49] goal okay so they have they have oil yes
[32:51] and they have lamps yep so they've got
[32:54] oil and they've got lamps and they are
[32:56] burning their flames all right jump into
[32:59] the there you go you're right there

[33:24] front we'll skip you so five wi five
[33:27] foolish we have lamps where do we go
[33:29] from there where's the story
[33:33] go no okay can I I'll I'll try and I'll
[33:36] try and catch up myself um okay okay so
[33:39] what's what's the difference between the
[33:40] five W and five foolish what what made
[33:42] them different do you
[33:44] remember give my here if I
[33:55] want they did so five the wise had spare
[33:59] oil
[34:01] great okay now what what are the the The
[34:04] Virgins what are they what are they
[34:05] waiting for what what is what is the the
[34:07] story in a
[34:12] of they were they were they were part of
[34:16] the wedding moving along so we got five
[34:19] wise five fullish they have oil they
[34:20] have lamps they're waiting for the um
[34:23] for the wedding and then what happens um
[34:28] the oil runs out yeah the oil runs out
[34:30] because the bridegroom carries he
[34:32] doesn't turn up on
[34:34] time wasn't a female this time it was
[34:36] the
[34:39] guy oh
[34:42] my it's getting hot in
[34:45] here okay so so the so so the cherry and
[34:49] the and the Flames all go out and then
[34:50] the C sorry I won't Jump Ahead what
[34:52] happens next
[35:01] so we're all waiting and everyone falls
[35:04] asleep you got five wise foolish
[35:07] five
[35:10] wise and they're all waiting for the
[35:12] bridegroom and
[35:18] then should we skip ah H that's right
[35:21] that's right skip ahe to the back what
[35:23] do we
[35:25] got no no no the the the younger
[35:34] ones I began to a birthday party I don't
[35:36] think you're
[35:38] quite memory fails me
[35:41] anyway okay okay so we all wait they're
[35:43] all waiting they fall asleep and then a
[35:45] call comes
[35:46] out
[35:51] yep they they do we've skipped the head
[35:53] a little bit so obviously the bridegroom
[35:55] we're waiting for him he finally the
[35:56] call comes out PR here let's go let's go
[36:00] and then they go we don't have enough
[36:02] oil well the the fil fullish don't so
[36:04] they don't have enough oil so yes they
[36:06] go to buy oil and what happens while
[36:08] they're buying
[36:09] oil yes staring straight at
[36:14] here G closes pretty much they they go
[36:18] and they're not allowed in so that's
[36:20] that's a basic quick run through of the
[36:22] story so I've got I've got a few notes
[36:25] um against against that that part of the
[36:27] story did no we won't read it um right
[36:32] so the kingdom of God is likened under
[36:34] 10 V likened unto 10 virgins Waiting for
[36:37] God so five wise and five
[36:40] foolish um quick precursor that's that's
[36:44] the the The Virgins they are not
[36:49] worshiping other gods they are not
[36:53] following Past Times They are in God's
[36:56] word as God's word it is now they're
[36:59] virgins they are pure they are absolute
[37:02] they are the best
[37:03] okay but says five wise and five foolish
[37:07] and not to put a scare or or a moment or
[37:11] anyone to look sideways but some people
[37:13] won't make it that's that's that's just
[37:15] it that's that's the run of the game
[37:17] it's you're called and you need to have
[37:20] the oil so the five foolish um took no
[37:23] extra oil now the oil is is the Holy
[37:28] Ghost amen that's that's the depiction
[37:30] of it in this in the story The
[37:32] Five wise and foolish virgins they had
[37:35] oil they both had oil both they they
[37:38] both sets had lamps do we do we know
[37:41] what a basic old oil lamp looks like you
[37:44] know the idea of it yeah okay so so it's
[37:47] a bowl well the really basic version of
[37:50] it is a bowl and they can make it out of
[37:52] clay Humanity but they can make it out
[37:54] of clay or whatever they want and they
[37:56] fill it with oil put a little bit oil in
[37:58] there and then they get a wick which is
[38:00] um you see a candle the the wick is is
[38:03] sort of the same sort of thing um I
[38:06] think there's a there's a texture they
[38:07] put on to stop it just burning all the
[38:08] way down but the idea is the the wick
[38:12] sits into the bowl just drapes in there
[38:15] and sort of squrs around into the bottom
[38:16] so that's in the oil and the oil gets
[38:18] soaked up the wick and it comes to the
[38:20] top and then they light the top of it
[38:22] and it's actually the oil that burns at
[38:24] the tip of the wick so that's your basic
[38:26] you know that made fancier ones because
[38:28] obviously you need to now protect the
[38:29] flame so the flame doesn't go out and
[38:31] and they get they get more more and more
[38:33] intense as as the um as people became
[38:35] smarter and decided what they wanted to
[38:37] do with these oils but that's the whole
[38:39] idea so you're burning the oil and that
[38:42] is your
[38:44] light
[38:46] so the the five wise and foolish had
[38:50] these lamps they had the flame going
[38:52] they had oil in their lamps because they
[38:54] were burning
[38:55] it um but
[38:59] the um but uh the lamp yeah so the lamp
[39:03] gives out light burning oil burning the
[39:05] Holy Spirit showing the life on display
[39:09] and you can even sing the little song
[39:10] that's a lot of mine I'm going to let it
[39:11] shine so that's they were all doing the
[39:14] right thing at the right time they were
[39:16] all virgins all perfectly honoring God
[39:19] and worshiping him so I keep looking at
[39:21] you guys cuz you're the biggest group
[39:23] don't
[39:24] don't everyone else is sort of spread
[39:26] out and hidden um
[39:28] so they're they're definitely putting
[39:29] their putting their life and putting
[39:31] their token on display they're letting
[39:33] they letting people know that um hey we
[39:35] are Christians we do worship God and
[39:39] that they're doing the right thing um
[39:41] but you see the difference is the wse
[39:44] took extra oil now to have oil separate
[39:48] that you aren't burning and isn't on
[39:51] display is something that you keep for
[39:54] yourself that is you and your walk with
[39:56] God that that is I'll jumped ahead that
[39:59] that is that but that is also rapturing
[40:01] Faith so there's a difference between
[40:04] what you're burning what you're showing
[40:05] what your token is on display and then
[40:08] there's your reservoir of this is my
[40:10] rapturing faith this is this is what I'm
[40:12] going to go to this is what I've got
[40:15] when I've shown and tried to talk to
[40:19] anyone I can try to sh share the message
[40:21] try to give out all that I have once
[40:24] that's run out I have rapturing faith
[40:27] and God will take me um so I've jumped
[40:33] ahead um so the bridegroom tered waiting
[40:35] um and that's Waiting for the End how
[40:37] how much longer Lord and all slept which
[40:41] I thought was quite
[40:42] interesting um and at midnight the call
[40:45] came the brim is here go out to meet him
[40:48] and that's that's the most exciting time
[40:51] as a Christian that's it we're going to
[40:53] the Rapture let's let's
[40:55] go um and the foolish did not have
[40:58] enough
[40:59] oil um and that's that's the moment of a
[41:04] little bit of a moment of Reckoning as
[41:06] in at this point I've given all I can
[41:09] but I don't have any
[41:11] inall why why have I not got any in
[41:15] store
[41:17] um and then they asked the wise they
[41:20] said hey can can you give us some can we
[41:23] can we pray through with you can we can
[41:26] we get in with you guys
[41:28] and unfortunately the wise said no
[41:29] because as good as they all are even the
[41:33] wise do not have spear to
[41:36] give and that's that's a very hard thing
[41:39] to to know um you can do all you can for
[41:45] anyone and everyone but at the end of
[41:46] the day you need to look after yourself
[41:48] and your walk with God it's um very
[41:52] important and they said no sorry we
[41:54] can't we've got enough for ourselves and
[41:57] our Rapture um if we if we give to you
[42:01] we we wouldn't have enough for
[42:02] ourselves
[42:07] um yeah so the foolish asked for the
[42:10] wise for the wises oil they could not
[42:12] give it to them even if they wanted to
[42:14] the bride elect did not have enough to
[42:17] spare did not have enough rapturing
[42:19] Faith no one has enough to
[42:22] spare your mom your dad it's an
[42:26] individual walk
[42:28] could even say your
[42:29] pastor anyone they do not have enough to
[42:32] spare for you it's your walk it's an
[42:35] individual walk um you and God you need
[42:38] to walk with
[42:39] god um I've got
[42:44] a quick um except from a William
[42:48] Brandon's sermon um these your five wise
[42:53] virgins who had oil in their lamps
[42:56] rapturing in faith believ in all the
[42:58] signs wonders prophecies and
[43:01] everything and these five cut out of the
[43:04] remnant was taken away the rest of them
[43:06] were still virgins and will not be lost
[43:09] but they will go through the tribulation
[43:11] period and Jesus said there there will
[43:14] be sort of trails off there and they
[43:16] said give us some of your oil we want
[43:18] the Holy Ghost now now anyone knows that
[43:21] the Holy Ghost in Zechariah 4 and oh
[43:24] James
[43:26] 5:14 all know that it represents oh he's
[43:29] he sort of skipped ahead um all know
[43:31] that it represents the Holy Ghost now he
[43:33] said that's the reason we anoint with
[43:35] oil representing the Holy Ghost now the
[43:37] oil of the spirit the Bible
[43:44] said now these had the Holy Ghost and
[43:47] were Sanctified these
[43:49] were Sanctified plus the Holy Ghost
[43:51] believe in all phenomenons and in
[43:54] everything of God's power everything God
[43:56] spoke of here
[43:57] they had it believ in it these were
[43:59] taken out and they said give to us now
[44:03] and they said we just got enough to get
[44:06] him with and they went away in the
[44:08] Rapture and it said go and buy from
[44:11] those who sell and they said they went
[44:14] to try to pray through then to receive
[44:16] the Holy Ghost but the Gentile
[44:18] dispensation had finished and the
[44:20] persecution Rose and he said they were
[44:23] cast into outer Darkness where there was
[44:25] weeping and wailing and there of teeth
[44:28] but in the second Resurrection there
[44:30] will be sheep that separate separated
[44:32] from the goats but never the bride never
[44:35] elect that's the remnant of the seed of
[44:37] the
[44:42] woman
[44:44] um so we've got how how to build Rapture
[44:47] in faith first of all faith is god-given
[44:51] um so what we can do is look to those
[44:54] who have been raptured so we have Enoch
[44:56] we have Elijah and Enoch walked with God
[45:00] and was not for God took him amen walk
[45:03] with God that's how that's how you get
[45:06] rapturing Faith so how do you walk with
[45:08] God stay in his presence move as God
[45:12] moves have the one-on-one relationship
[45:15] with
[45:19] him yeah not God Pastor me god dad then
[45:24] me God propit me
[45:27] it's just God and you amen spend time in
[45:31] his word read your Bible
[45:34] pray it's great to have family time and
[45:37] Bible time but you need to pray and read
[45:40] your Bible yourself
[45:43] am um listen to God's word for for this
[45:46] day so William brandom sermons come to
[45:48] church as we do what you feed on will
[45:53] what you feed on you will be
[45:59] if you listen to things that will be if
[46:02] you listen to
[46:03] things if you listen to bad things
[46:06] you'll be grumpy and upset all the time
[46:08] listen to rock and roll that is a spirit
[46:10] of suicide on it movies and
[46:13] entertainment lustfulness what you feed
[46:16] on will affect you until you do the
[46:19] things that you don't want to do and
[46:21] believe things you wouldn't normally
[46:24] believe now we can't now we can't always
[46:27] see things but you can stop the second
[46:33] look yeah see you can't always stop
[46:36] seeing things but you can stop the
[46:38] second look and that's when you start um
[46:41] uh an ad comes on or a prompt in in the
[46:45] the YouTube I um quite a few years ago
[46:48] now um started getting quite a few
[46:50] YouTube prompts for watching some of the
[46:52] more political things and they they go
[46:57] quite hard against um certain certain um
[47:02] um presidents and and you can swing one
[47:05] way or the other and then they started
[47:06] going into some of the the movement at
[47:09] the moment which is into um The People's
[47:12] self identifying as whatever they want
[47:14] to be and you can sum it up quite
[47:17] quickly as fashion but hey that's what
[47:19] it is but you start getting wound out
[47:21] when they start talking about
[47:24] influencing younger people um and and
[47:27] what they teaching in schools and the
[47:29] likes and things like that and I was
[47:31] getting a little bit wound up because
[47:33] you know what you hear of what's going
[47:34] on in America and things like that it
[47:36] affects you and I found that I was
[47:38] getting grumpy I was getting grumpy I
[47:40] was getting upset I would not that I
[47:43] ever saw much of it here it was um as I
[47:46] say a few years ago but I caught myself
[47:49] I caught myself needlessly getting upset
[47:52] and I'm like what what am I what am I
[47:54] doing and it's what I was feeding on and
[47:55] I was so quick there was no sort of like
[47:58] little bit of little bit of here little
[48:00] bit of there then you start sort of
[48:01] scroll and of course the the YouTube
[48:03] algorithm is the more you look on it the
[48:06] more it feeds those little things and
[48:08] and of course it keeps you on one side
[48:09] because that you watch more of it if
[48:11] they show the full spectrum you start
[48:13] listening to both and and and you do and
[48:15] and I started getting wound up so what I
[48:17] fed on What affected me straight
[48:21] away so I stopped watching it by the
[48:24] way and yeah and know that obviously as
[48:28] you cuz I'm sort of thinking about
[48:29] myself and raising kids and and in that
[48:31] perspective obviously I want them to be
[48:33] growing up in God's word and God's word
[48:36] said man female and sorts it out so from
[48:39] that perspective I was like no no no I
[48:41] need to not get myself wound up about
[48:43] this give it back to God and carry it on
[48:45] with my walk with
[48:46] god um so that's that's that second look
[48:50] so you see one and it's a it's a
[48:52] clickbait it's it's interesting and and
[48:54] then you watch again and then the second
[48:56] look and then the look and then by that
[48:58] time you wrapped into it um what about
[49:00] in the physical more
[49:03] um um what about a half-dressed woman or
[49:06] man goes both ways um walking down the
[49:09] street you can't help seeing that's just
[49:12] normal the second look you can't help
[49:14] and that's when you start stopping what
[49:17] the devil's trying to throw in front of
[49:19] you and know it for what it is it's not
[49:20] the person it's the spirit on them you
[49:23] stop that second look cuz the second
[49:25] look becomes a third look becomes now
[49:27] you're interested and now you're
[49:29] actually trying to follow those types of
[49:34] people um yeah so stop the second look
[49:39] Man's eyes are attracted to movement
[49:41] that is a natural thing where are
[49:42] Hunters by by trade some of us are by
[49:46] trade um but we notice the movement and
[49:48] that's what we we follow but you can
[49:51] quickly see what's appropriate and
[49:54] what's not no need for the second look
[49:58] God has your wife or husband sorted for
[50:00] you and it's not some half-dressed
[50:02] person walking down the street stop the
[50:04] second look build rapturing Faith walk
[50:08] with
[50:09] god um stand on God's
[50:13] word and you'll be an anomaly in this
[50:16] world and always will
[50:20] be um just going back to our first
[50:22] reading so the first reading is in
[50:25] Matthew and
[50:28] you don't need to turn back to it I
[50:30] haven't actually references I do have a
[50:31] few more references but I haven't um I
[50:35] sort of want to keep keep the kids
[50:37] interested um so um going back to the
[50:40] first read of Jesus and his disciples on
[50:41] the Mount of Olives and it's a real
[50:44] place um Rachel's not here to sort of
[50:46] pointed out but she has been there oh
[50:47] and and K you've been there um it's a
[50:50] real place you can visit it if you want
[50:51] to but Jesus was there and he says to
[50:54] them you're all going to be offended
[50:56] because of of me tonight now that's
[50:58] that's a hard saying for anyone even if
[51:01] it's just a friend saying that to you
[51:03] it's hard for you not to instantly push
[51:05] against it and Peter being the the sort
[51:08] of quick to respond type of guy that he
[51:11] is said no I'll never I I'll never be
[51:14] ashamed of
[51:16] you
[51:18] and then Jesus responded you'll deny me
[51:21] three
[51:25] times yeah you me three times and yeah
[51:28] imagine that
[51:30] imagine you're
[51:33] there you followed this guy you've
[51:36] dropped everything and he did he dropped
[51:38] everything he was a fisherman his whole
[51:39] livelihood what he used to know he
[51:41] dropped the lot and he followed Jesus
[51:44] he' been through the pile that had left
[51:46] and it was just down to the 12 he still
[51:48] followed him and this night you'll deny
[51:52] me three
[51:53] times um the story carries on that
[51:57] um Jesus also talks to them and um says
[52:02] I'm just trying to paraphrase but says
[52:04] have you gotten any swords those that
[52:05] don't have swords you should sell your
[52:07] garments and go buy
[52:09] swords um and they said hey we've got
[52:11] two already and Jesus said that's enough
[52:15] and then Jesus went off to pray and they
[52:17] all fall asleep he comes back finds them
[52:20] and scolds them and says why are you
[52:21] falling asleep you couldn't wait for an
[52:23] hour you couldn't and um and then
[52:25] they're like oh okay and then he goes
[52:27] back off and prays again and he comes
[52:29] back and finds him asleep again and he
[52:30] leaves
[52:32] him
[52:34] now
[52:35] then
[52:37] before yeah so then Jesus comes back and
[52:40] then you've got this multitude of people
[52:42] coming at them and it's a multitude of
[52:45] um people with swords and it says staves
[52:46] so that's that's all your spars and
[52:48] sticks and things coming at them and
[52:50] then you've got Peter now Peter is he's
[52:53] a he's a reactor he's he was the first
[52:54] out of the boat he he's the one that
[52:56] jumps and that I've got this so you've
[52:58] got Peter he's been told you're going to
[53:00] deny me three times he's been asked do
[53:02] you have a sword yeah I got a sword um
[53:05] and actually says later um I think it's
[53:07] in John that it says that it's Peter
[53:09] that jumps up and then you got a
[53:10] multitude of people coming at you oh
[53:12] it's it's it's fight time let's go so he
[53:15] grabs the sword out goes out to defend
[53:18] Jesus and takes takes the first
[53:21] swing and either he wasn't very good or
[53:24] the guy dodged and he got his ear off
[53:27] got him um and then Jesus stops them now
[53:30] you want to be
[53:31] confused how about being wound up this
[53:35] is this is what's going to happen you're
[53:36] going to you're going to do this you
[53:38] know you're going to deny me you're
[53:40] you're going to going to pretend I'm not
[53:42] even here you're going to and then oh
[53:44] you got a sword yeah y yep and then and
[53:45] then a battle comes on at you that's it
[53:48] I'm in and then he stops you no this is
[53:51] not your
[53:53] fight so we need to know CU if you
[53:57] actually go back to where he Jesus was
[53:59] talking he talks to them and says
[54:02] tonight I'm I'm going to I'm going to be
[54:05] taken um paraphrasing again sorry
[54:10] but he wasn't listening he was all
[54:13] focused on self he was focused on no no
[54:16] no I've I've been told I'm going to deny
[54:17] him I'm not I'm never going to deny him
[54:19] even if they kill me right there's a
[54:20] whole bunch of people for me to fight
[54:21] against I'm in there's and it wasn't his
[54:24] fight
[54:30] um yeah oh oh it's fight time God warned
[54:33] me I have my sword let's go what
[54:35] happened Jesus stopped him it's not his
[54:37] fight the world coming to the end is not
[54:40] our
[54:41] fight that's what is forone for for told
[54:45] we knew he knew he should have known
[54:47] that it was that Jesus needed to be the
[54:49] sacrifice if he' listened we know that
[54:52] this Earth is is to come to an end it's
[54:54] not our fight we need to stay with God's
[54:56] true word then Jesus and then Jesus got
[55:00] LED away and now for Peter comes the
[55:04] test
[55:06] because it is a
[55:08] lot um so now comes a test Peter follows
[55:10] him and
[55:12] watches and it takes one maid someone
[55:16] who
[55:17] is against a guy back in those days who
[55:20] was strong a fisherman and had done he
[55:24] was he was about ready to take on a
[55:25] multitude of God guys with this one
[55:27] little sword took one little Maid to say
[55:30] hey aren't you the guy that walked with
[55:32] Jesus for him to go no no never been
[55:35] that that's n and another one no no
[55:39] surely you're the one with Jesus no no
[55:41] not that and it sort of shows it is
[55:44] sometimes actually most the time a lot
[55:46] easier to have something dead against
[55:48] you for you to
[55:50] fight you get a little niggle or a
[55:53] little oh no come on you can you can
[55:55] come along with us this will be fun oh
[55:57] yeah okay maybe oh just just just one
[56:00] little drink oh yeah oh no I don't drink
[56:02] oh you don't drink oh that's fine it's
[56:04] fine just come along just come along
[56:05] anyway just come to the party don't have
[56:08] to drink just just to just whereas if
[56:11] someone stood there and held something
[56:14] I'm using drink as an example everyone's
[56:16] got their own
[56:17] um um what what's the what's the word
[56:20] when something comes against you it's
[56:22] like a everyone has their own thing they
[56:24] struggle with or get packed by um so you
[56:29] know just just just one little just one
[56:31] little
[56:32] drink and it would have been easier to
[56:34] fight if someone was standing in front
[56:36] of you with a drink saying I want to
[56:37] force this down your throat for you to
[56:38] actually fight back and go H there you
[56:40] know that is easier than than someone
[56:42] little unassuming
[56:45] um physically not imposing or strong to
[56:49] just go oh just just take a little bit
[56:51] oh come on be cool join in and for for
[56:54] you to actually then start questioning
[56:57] what you stand on and if you're not in
[56:59] God's word you will
[57:01] partake that's that's the long and the
[57:03] short of it
[57:05] um yeah when it was guys with swords and
[57:08] a fight he he was in but a little bit of
[57:11] peer pressure and he
[57:14] folds now this is this is Peter he
[57:16] walked on water with Jesus he cast out
[57:19] demons with Jesus was ready to defend
[57:21] Jesus against the multitude and one maid
[57:24] saying you were with Jesus you're a
[57:26] Christian you pray to God for him to
[57:29] deny
[57:34] Christ
[57:36] um so don't don't underestimate peer
[57:39] pressure and he folds sometimes it's
[57:42] easier to have a defiant opposition to
[57:45] fight against than a little bit of peer
[57:47] pressure there's a um a sort of an easy
[57:51] scenario where is if you're standing
[57:54] there and say the devil PS in front of
[57:56] you and he's red as he is in the the
[57:59] little comics and he's got a pitchfork
[58:01] and a fork tail and he says oh you
[58:04] you're going to deny God for you to
[58:05] suddenly fight against but he doesn't
[58:06] come at you like that cuz he's he's
[58:08] smarter than that he knows how to get
[58:10] around things he knows how to just just
[58:12] drop those little bits of oh come on
[58:13] come do this oh here's a little ad just
[58:16] watch this oh here's a little bit of a a
[58:18] show here's a here's a bit of a whatever
[58:21] your fight is he he will he knows what
[58:23] it is and he'll just just niggle away at
[58:25] it until you start partaking and if
[58:28] you're not walking with
[58:30] God I'm sorry you will fail it's it's
[58:34] it's written through
[58:38] um yeah come come with us have a smoke
[58:41] have a drink you're not going to tell
[58:44] are you just relax I know you go to
[58:46] church just join
[58:47] in uh no need to pray no need to pray
[58:50] over your food at
[58:52] McDonald's this this was an interesting
[58:54] one for me so as as a kid I um Dad Dad
[58:59] would always pray and before you before
[59:01] you eat and it fine no no issues um I as
[59:05] a kid didn't really recognize um
[59:07] McDonald's as a restaurant it was just
[59:08] to grab food and carry on for me a
[59:10] restaurant was you go to a nice
[59:11] restaurant you sit down you pick the
[59:13] menu um and so I sitting in this in this
[59:16] restaurant and at McDonald's and dad
[59:20] goes to pray and all of a sudden and if
[59:23] you look at it sort of logically all of
[59:25] a sudden I'm more concerned about all
[59:27] these people in this restaurant that I'm
[59:29] I don't know I'm never going to see
[59:30] again probably I'm more concerned about
[59:32] what they think of me than actually
[59:34] praying to God it was an instant like
[59:37] hang on a minute and it wasn't until I
[59:39] got older that I sort of re-evaluated
[59:42] things like hang on where where do I
[59:43] stand what what actually is the show
[59:45] here it could be even for someone
[59:48] sitting in that um that that restaurant
[59:51] seeing someone else praying and being
[59:52] like Oh actually it's been a while since
[59:54] I've prayed and and that might have been
[59:56] all the kick they needed but in my
[59:58] little mind I was suddenly more
[1:00:00] conscious of people I didn't know it's
[1:00:03] and it's funny how someone you don't
[1:00:05] know affects your life and you shouldn't
[1:00:08] let it you should be walking with
[1:00:11] god
[1:00:13] um yeah peer pressure it's real and if
[1:00:17] you're not walking with God have the
[1:00:19] Holy Ghost rapturing Faith you will
[1:00:22] fail uh but don't worry Peter had enough
[1:00:25] of room experience and that changed him
[1:00:28] from head to toe now nothing could shake
[1:00:30] him nothing going on in the world
[1:00:32] nothing walk nothing walking by in front
[1:00:35] of him nothing distracting as a phone
[1:00:37] social media popular opinion fashion of
[1:00:40] the day what others would think he lived
[1:00:43] for
[1:00:45] God young people live for God your walk
[1:00:50] you read your Bible and you pray
[1:00:53] remember God deals with Israel as a
[1:00:56] nation and Gentiles as

[1:07:58] musicians uh let's just turn in our
[1:08:00] Bibles to Hebrews chapter
[1:08:06] 10
[1:08:08] um can you bring up the the
[1:08:16] PowerPoint all right we'll just read
[1:08:18] this and then you can have your seats is
[1:08:20] that big enough oh it's really really
[1:08:22] small
[1:08:23] um okay
[1:08:26] um so the Bible says here for the law
[1:08:29] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:08:32] and not the very image of the things can
[1:08:34] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:08:36] offered year by year continually make
[1:08:39] the comers there unto
[1:08:41] perfect so um I just want you to notice
[1:08:44] there one thing the law has a
[1:08:46] shadow and but the shadow is not the
[1:08:49] very image of the things to come and
[1:08:52] then if we can just drop down to um
[1:09:02] uh uh down to verse
[1:09:06] 19 um we won't read all of it we'll just
[1:09:09] read that first verse having therefore
[1:09:11] Breen boldness to enter into the holiest
[1:09:13] of holies by the blood of Jesus Amen you
[1:09:16] can have your seats so uh I just want to
[1:09:20] say two things brother Ben if I say
[1:09:22] anything not quite right you can correct
[1:09:24] me afterwards and and just tell everyone
[1:09:26] okay that wasn't right um and then the
[1:09:30] other thing is um I think for any
[1:09:32] minister or any person standing here and
[1:09:35] preaching because you're preaching the
[1:09:36] word of God you're preaching it to
[1:09:38] yourself
[1:09:39] so you know the things that you preach
[1:09:42] is it doesn't mean that you don't
[1:09:43] struggle or you've got it down pat for
[1:09:45] lack of better words um it applies to
[1:09:48] you just as much as as as the
[1:09:50] congregation
[1:09:51] so um all right I hope this works but um
[1:09:56] but B mentioned a few things um in this
[1:09:58] morning service which I'm glad about
[1:10:00] because it means that we're in the same
[1:10:03] I'm on the right channel if you like so
[1:10:05] I hope this was going to work but I
[1:10:07] don't know if it will
[1:10:08] but I have a shadow right everyone has a
[1:10:12] shadow so uh I should have grabbed a
[1:10:15] torch or something but if I hold my hand
[1:10:19] here if you see that shadow can you see
[1:10:22] right now what's making that shadow
[1:10:25] no you can't but the closer I come to
[1:10:29] it okay it's a little bit more clearer
[1:10:31] okay we can see it's a long Shadow but
[1:10:33] we still don't know what it is if I'm
[1:10:35] about there you can probably make out
[1:10:36] okay these fingers okay that's a hand
[1:10:39] but when my hand gets here you see oh
[1:10:41] okay it's a hand it's a hand what we're
[1:10:43] looking at so the
[1:10:48] law is a shadow and it was showing
[1:10:51] something coming so um so all the uh
[1:10:57] stories and things we read in the Old
[1:10:58] Testament um had foreshadowed something
[1:11:02] had showed something um it talked about
[1:11:04] something that was
[1:11:06] coming um
[1:11:08] and yeah so so so a lot of things in the
[1:11:10] Bible is like brother bam says you've
[1:11:12] got to read between the lines um it
[1:11:14] means something it means something
[1:11:15] that's that that was going to come and
[1:11:17] it's painting a picture
[1:11:21] so all right
[1:11:26] so yeah so all these old stories and
[1:11:29] things in the Bible it all pointed to
[1:11:31] Calvary and God's Redemption plan on
[1:11:34] Earth um brother Ben preached about the
[1:11:36] Redemption plan this morning so it's
[1:11:39] it's it's it's painting a picture and
[1:11:40] it'll probably become more clearer as we
[1:11:42] carry on so can we put up the next
[1:11:46] slide
[1:11:50] please yep that's the one so this is a
[1:11:55] picture of um Abraham and Isaac probably
[1:11:58] after Isaac was going to be offered but
[1:12:00] what I just want to show was just a
[1:12:01] sacrifice so um so obviously uh the Old
[1:12:05] Testament Believers had to perform
[1:12:06] sacrifices and all these things under
[1:12:08] the law
[1:12:10] um and and that was a picture of Christ
[1:12:16] coming and dying on the cross so all
[1:12:18] these things that happened was a shadow
[1:12:20] but it wasn't the hand yet the hand was
[1:12:23] Jesus coming and dying on the cross our
[1:12:25] sins the perfect lamb
[1:12:30] so um so it's not just that there many
[1:12:32] things that happen so
[1:12:34] also uh so we know natural Israel is a
[1:12:38] type of spiritual Israel which is us
[1:12:40] which is which is the
[1:12:42] believer so and the things which Israel
[1:12:45] went
[1:12:46] through in the Old Testament reflects
[1:12:50] what we go through what the church goes
[1:12:51] through and also the the individual the
[1:12:53] believer goes through
[1:13:00] so so brother brandom says so we're
[1:13:03] going to talk about Abraham for a bit so
[1:13:04] brother Bram says the beginning of
[1:13:06] Christianity the beginning of the church
[1:13:08] was with
[1:13:10] Abraham so um okay we're going to have
[1:13:14] like a little bit of a history lesson
[1:13:15] and uh if you can put on the Le next
[1:13:17] slide please Talia so uh I hope that's
[1:13:20] visible but I thought it would be nice
[1:13:22] to just visualize it so I don't know if
[1:13:24] this picture is correct it's the only
[1:13:26] one I could find and it it it lines up
[1:13:28] with what the Bible says so uh so if
[1:13:32] brother baham says Christianity started
[1:13:34] with the beginning of the church was
[1:13:35] with Abraham so the life of Abraham and
[1:13:38] his Descendants the children of
[1:13:40] Israel
[1:13:42] um is painting a painted a picture and
[1:13:45] we'll we'll we'll see as we carry on
[1:13:50] so um I'm just going to read these
[1:13:52] scriptures but um Talia if you could be
[1:13:54] on the trigger I would appreciate it and
[1:13:56] if you could just put up this actually
[1:13:58] no keep the map on there keep the map on
[1:14:00] there
[1:14:02] um the Lord came to Abraham so this is
[1:14:05] the first time in the Bible that God
[1:14:07] appeared to
[1:14:09] Abraham and
[1:14:11] um and the Bible says now the Lord had
[1:14:14] said to Abraham get thee out of thy
[1:14:15] country and from thy Kindred and from
[1:14:18] thy Father's House unto a land which I
[1:14:20] will show thee and I will make of thee a
[1:14:22] great nation and I will bless thee and
[1:14:24] make thy am great and thou shall be a
[1:14:26] blessing and I will bless them that
[1:14:28] bless them and curse him that curseth
[1:14:30] thee and in thee shall all the families
[1:14:32] of the earth be blessed okay I'll
[1:14:34] backtrack slightly so before this
[1:14:37] Abraham lived with his father and er of
[1:14:39] the chales which is up
[1:14:41] here up here um you guys probably
[1:14:44] recognize that is um modern day Israel
[1:14:46] is roughly there and that was canaan's
[1:14:48] land back then so so Abraham's father
[1:14:53] and Abraham and Sarah and family members
[1:14:56] traveled up to that place called haran
[1:14:58] right at the top I don't know when he
[1:15:00] came in but I can't see it speaking
[1:15:02] about it on the Bible but there
[1:15:04] Abraham's father died and this is when
[1:15:07] the Lord appeared to Abraham and said
[1:15:08] and said um get thee out of thy country
[1:15:12] and from th Kindred and from th Father's
[1:15:13] House unto a land which I will show thee
[1:15:16] and that was canaan's land down there
[1:15:19] so
[1:15:22] uh so at this point Abraham was 5 years
[1:15:25] old so when he was 75 he departed from
[1:15:29] haran and went down to shikim which is
[1:15:33] somewhere I don't know where all these
[1:15:35] stops on the way what what they meant to
[1:15:37] mean but this is just the picture I got
[1:15:38] off the internet so so Abraham went
[1:15:40] there but the Lord said to
[1:15:45] Abraham get thee out of th country and
[1:15:47] from th Kindred and from their father's
[1:15:49] house but brother bam says he did
[1:15:51] exactly what the Lord told him not to do
[1:15:54] and he took lot
[1:15:55] his nephew with
[1:15:59] him okay
[1:16:02] so so so as Abraham's life is carrying
[1:16:05] on oh I wanted to put a picture up there
[1:16:07] of um them living in tense because
[1:16:09] that's what they lived in back then was
[1:16:10] tense in that desert country so um so
[1:16:14] Abraham continued down and the Bible
[1:16:15] talks about him going down into Egypt
[1:16:17] because there was a famine up there and
[1:16:19] then he went South of Egypt and then he
[1:16:20] came back to the land that God initially
[1:16:22] called him to
[1:16:25] and
[1:16:28] uh and then in Genesis 13 the Lord comes
[1:16:31] to Abraham
[1:16:33] again actually sorry in
[1:16:37] between okay so the next thing that
[1:16:39] happened was um was the argument that um
[1:16:42] Abraham's her men had with lots her men
[1:16:44] they separated so lot went to Sodom and
[1:16:47] Abraham stayed we in canaan's land and
[1:16:51] then the Bible says and the Lord said to
[1:16:53] Abram after that lot was separated from
[1:16:56] him lift up now thine eyes and look from
[1:16:59] the place where thou art northward and
[1:17:01] Southward and Eastward and Westward so
[1:17:03] Abraham's in the land looking northward
[1:17:05] Southward Eastward and Westward for all
[1:17:08] the land which thou seest to thee will I
[1:17:10] give it and to thy seed forever and I
[1:17:13] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[1:17:14] earth so that if a man can number the
[1:17:16] dust of the earth then
[1:17:18] shall then shall thy seed also be
[1:17:21] numbered arise walk through the land the
[1:17:23] length of it and the breadth of it for I
[1:17:25] will give it unto thee so that was one
[1:17:29] of the first instances instances where
[1:17:31] the Lord promised that land to the Seed
[1:17:33] of
[1:17:35] Abraham all right so
[1:17:39] so so uh this was after lot separated
[1:17:43] Abraham separated from lot so finally
[1:17:45] Abraham was in the place where the Lord
[1:17:47] wanted him from the
[1:17:49] beginning and then he came and reminded
[1:17:52] him of his promise so bear in mind God
[1:17:55] is promising all these things to Abraham
[1:17:57] but his wife can't have children he
[1:17:58] doesn't have any children so how is this
[1:18:01] going to be your seed he said to
[1:18:04] Abraham so I just want to just make a
[1:18:07] point on
[1:18:09] um on how lot had to separate abraam had
[1:18:13] to be separated from lot before the Lord
[1:18:16] um continued as as plan um in Abraham's
[1:18:20] life so uh we just the next um slide
[1:18:24] we'll just read a quote of brother
[1:18:26] brandham so brother Bram says sometimes
[1:18:29] you have to separate from everything
[1:18:30] that's dear on Earth to you to take your
[1:18:32] position that God has called you to I'm
[1:18:35] sure you can read between the lines what
[1:18:36] I'm saying see sometimes the very
[1:18:38] dearest person on Earth you have to
[1:18:40] shake hands with them and take your
[1:18:41] position in Christ to where God has
[1:18:43] called you but what is God doing
[1:18:45] transforming you from what you was maybe
[1:18:48] a daughter or son or whatever it is from
[1:18:50] a lovely family sometimes he places you
[1:18:52] somewhere else because it's his way of
[1:18:55] doing it see by the renewing of your
[1:18:57] mind to obey the word of God regardless
[1:19:00] of what the price is
[1:19:04] um our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing
[1:19:07] it was the son of God had to die for us
[1:19:09] see things of value come at great price
[1:19:13] next
[1:19:14] slide to bring this message it wasn't
[1:19:17] easy see no it isn't I had to forsake
[1:19:19] everything that was dear to me even my
[1:19:21] own people everybody but see the value
[1:19:23] of it is you see is to do the will of
[1:19:26] God and to do that which knowing that
[1:19:28] there's something in me when they used
[1:19:30] to say well they was going to put me
[1:19:32] away thought I lost my mind baptizing in
[1:19:35] the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the
[1:19:37] church and all these things they said
[1:19:40] he's crazy but you see no matter what
[1:19:42] they said there's nothing there there is
[1:19:44] something has to be done and God just
[1:19:47] takes a person sticks him in his hand
[1:19:48] and say do this and you do it so um yeah
[1:19:53] so the same way for for abraam you know
[1:19:55] the Lord for his will to
[1:19:57] um he he he he he's moving in your life
[1:20:01] for you to walk in his will for your
[1:20:04] life all right so so back to Abraham can
[1:20:08] we just go back to that map again just
[1:20:09] I'll just keep it up there um in between
[1:20:12] the other
[1:20:13] slides actually I can control it from
[1:20:16] here can't
[1:20:17] I I think
[1:20:23] um sorry excuse me but Ben if I go over
[1:20:27] time just give me a nod and I'll cut it
[1:20:29] off
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:32] okay
[1:20:34] uh all right
[1:20:40] uh yeah so back to Abraham a few things
[1:20:42] happened and then for example um lot was
[1:20:46] taken captive by those kings and Abraham
[1:20:49] went and got them back um and like the
[1:20:54] king of Salem met him and and then again
[1:20:57] in Genesis 15 the Lord comes again to
[1:20:59] Abraham and and the Lord
[1:21:02] says after these things the word of the
[1:21:05] Lord came unto Abraham in a vision
[1:21:07] saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield
[1:21:10] and the exceeding great reward so see
[1:21:13] God is keep keeping on promising this to
[1:21:15] Abraham but Abraham is probably thinking
[1:21:17] well sarra kind have any children how is
[1:21:20] this going to
[1:21:21] happen and then uh the Bible says and
[1:21:25] Abraham said Lord God what Willl thou
[1:21:27] give me seeing I go childless and the
[1:21:30] steward of my house is this Ali ASA of
[1:21:34] Damascus and Abraham said behold to me
[1:21:38] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[1:21:40] in my house is mine Heir so Lord how are
[1:21:42] you going to fulfill this is this guy
[1:21:45] this servant in my house is he going to
[1:21:46] be my Heir is he going to is are you
[1:21:49] going to fill the promise through
[1:21:50] him um
[1:21:55] and then the Lord repeats his promises
[1:21:57] to Abraham I'm not going to read it it's
[1:21:59] quite a it's a long bit um
[1:22:03] but the Bible says and he believed the
[1:22:06] Lord and accounted it to him for
[1:22:08] righteousness so Abraham believed what
[1:22:10] the Lord said to
[1:22:13] him and then okay okay so this is the
[1:22:16] next interesting bit
[1:22:17] so so he said okay Lord your promis is
[1:22:20] to me but how by what will I know that
[1:22:23] you made this promise promise that I
[1:22:25] that I that I will inherit this land my
[1:22:27] seed will inherit this land and then
[1:22:30] um I'm going to read the verse in the
[1:22:33] Bible listen to it and then we'll I
[1:22:36] guess sort of unpack it um once I've
[1:22:39] read it
[1:22:42] um and he said unto him and he said Lord
[1:22:45] God whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:22:46] inherit it and he said unto him take me
[1:22:49] an hepher of three years old and a sheo
[1:22:51] goat of three years old and a ram of
[1:22:53] three years old and a turtle dove and a
[1:22:55] young pigeon and he took unto him all
[1:22:58] these and divided them in the midst and
[1:23:00] laid each piece one against the other
[1:23:02] but the birds he divided not and when
[1:23:05] the fouls came down upon the carcasses
[1:23:07] Abraham drove them
[1:23:09] away can we just put that up as I'm
[1:23:11] reading please um thank
[1:23:15] you and when the sun was going down a
[1:23:18] deep sleep fell upon Abraham so this is
[1:23:22] the response God gave to Abraham when he
[1:23:24] said how um should will I know you make
[1:23:26] this Covenant with me and when the sun
[1:23:29] was going down a deep SE sleep fell upon
[1:23:31] Abraham and low a horror of great
[1:23:33] Darkness fell upon
[1:23:35] him sorry that is um Genesis
[1:23:41] 15:3 and he
[1:23:43] said unto Abraham know of assurity that
[1:23:46] thy seed shall be a stranger and the
[1:23:48] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[1:23:50] them and they shall afflict them 400
[1:23:53] years and also that Nation whom they
[1:23:55] serve I will judge and afterward shall
[1:23:57] they come out with great substance so
[1:23:59] here God already foretold that the
[1:24:01] children of Israel Abram seed was going
[1:24:03] to be in Egypt and become slaves and the
[1:24:05] Lord was going to bring them out and
[1:24:08] thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[1:24:10] thou shall be buried a good age and so
[1:24:12] on and so forth and it came to pass that
[1:24:14] when the sun went down and it was dark
[1:24:17] so remember okay so
[1:24:20] um and it was dark Behold a smoking
[1:24:23] furnace and a burning lamp passed
[1:24:25] between the pieces so the carcasses that
[1:24:27] Abraham split of the
[1:24:29] animals in the same day the Lord made a
[1:24:31] commant covenant with Abraham saying
[1:24:34] unto thy seed have I given this land
[1:24:36] from the river of Egypt under the Great
[1:24:38] River the river Euphrates the land of
[1:24:41] the kenites the Kites and all those
[1:24:43] different
[1:24:45] names um right may I use one of you
[1:24:49] young guys for an example um for an
[1:24:52] example just to help me
[1:24:55] make an
[1:24:56] example all
[1:24:58] right all right so okay so
[1:25:03] here what we saw was God was making a
[1:25:06] covenant with
[1:25:07] Abraham um he promised him his seed will
[1:25:10] possess the land of his enemies Gates of
[1:25:12] his enemies and um and and he was making
[1:25:16] a covenant so in our day let's say
[1:25:18] you're a builder and I want a house to
[1:25:20] be built and B you can correct me this
[1:25:22] is wrong
[1:25:24] um
[1:25:26] so I'm going to pay you a certain amount
[1:25:28] of money and you're going to build me
[1:25:29] this house but we need to write up a
[1:25:32] contract so that none of us can pull out
[1:25:35] of the uh pull out of this agreement so
[1:25:39] we're write up a contract and that's
[1:25:41] legally binding and maybe we'll say okay
[1:25:43] yes um we we have a deal okay that
[1:25:47] that's today but back in um that day uh
[1:25:53] um what they used to do was they used to
[1:25:56] take an animal and cut it in half split
[1:25:58] it like we cut a deer up on the weekend
[1:26:01] so you guys would have a fresh picture
[1:26:02] of your mind what a animal taken apart
[1:26:05] looks like so and then they would put
[1:26:08] the animal split on the ground and then
[1:26:11] me and you would stand in between the
[1:26:12] animal and we would write on a piece of
[1:26:15] paper our
[1:26:17] contract yeah so probably not um that
[1:26:22] probably uh building a house probably is
[1:26:24] a little bit too serious for this but if
[1:26:25] it was a really serious Covenant okay so
[1:26:27] we wrote it on the paper we ripped the
[1:26:29] paper in half I gave you half and I have
[1:26:31] half so those two papers come back
[1:26:34] together so that's the Covenant no no
[1:26:35] one else can come and say uh no it was a
[1:26:39] different Covenant because you've got a
[1:26:40] half and I've got a half okay and then
[1:26:42] that's our agreement okay right thank
[1:26:45] you
[1:26:46] Mo
[1:26:48] um so that's how they did it back then
[1:26:51] so what was the Lord doing to Abraham
[1:26:53] there can you connect the dots he was
[1:26:56] making a covenant with Abraham with the
[1:26:59] with the animals that Abraham cut in
[1:27:00] half and the Bible says and it came to
[1:27:04] pass when the sun went down and it was
[1:27:06] dark Behold a smoking furnace and a
[1:27:09] burning lamp that passed between those
[1:27:12] pieces that passed between those pieces
[1:27:13] of animal so God was making a covenant
[1:27:16] he was he was confirming or making a
[1:27:18] covenant with Abraham that his seed will
[1:27:22] possess the land of Canan and will
[1:27:25] possess the gates of his
[1:27:27] enemies all
[1:27:32] right this is probably very basic but we
[1:27:35] we'll go through it anyway probably it's
[1:27:36] nothing new
[1:27:37] but all
[1:27:45] right all right I'll just read this
[1:27:47] quote
[1:27:51] um brother bam sees uh God told Abraham
[1:27:55] I have blessed you and I've made you a
[1:27:57] father not I will I have I have made you
[1:28:01] and you'll come to me in an old age
[1:28:03] you're going to be saved and I've
[1:28:04] already done it I've already said so you
[1:28:07] haven't got nothing to do with it it's
[1:28:09] unconditional God God determined to have
[1:28:12] his church so every time he made a
[1:28:15] covenant with man man breaks his
[1:28:17] Covenant and he does yet today man will
[1:28:20] always break his Covenant with God but
[1:28:21] God can't break his Covenant with man so
[1:28:24] I will so brother bam says that Covenant
[1:28:28] that God made with Abraham was
[1:28:30] unconditional so it wasn't it didn't
[1:28:33] depend on how good Abraham was he was a
[1:28:36] human being like me and you with sinful
[1:28:38] incl inclinations and faults and
[1:28:42] problems but the Lord said it doesn't
[1:28:44] matter who you are what you are I'm
[1:28:46] making this Covenant with you
[1:28:50] um so we we all know about the garden of
[1:28:54] Eden um the Covenant Covenant that God
[1:28:57] made with the Covenant that was there
[1:29:00] between God and Adam and Eve it said if
[1:29:03] you obey my word if you do this if you
[1:29:06] do that you will not die but if you
[1:29:08] don't you will die so this Covenant was
[1:29:11] sure it was it was because this was the
[1:29:15] whole picture of the Plan of Redemption
[1:29:17] God said it is so it's not if there's no
[1:29:19] questions about it so and I pray that
[1:29:21] the Lord makes that real to each one of
[1:29:23] us
[1:29:34] so um so once
[1:29:36] again so all these things that happened
[1:29:38] to Abraham in the natural means
[1:29:40] something in the spiritual it was
[1:29:42] showing something that was um was to
[1:29:45] come so we are not the may not
[1:29:50] necessarily be the physical descendants
[1:29:53] of Abraham
[1:29:55] but because this is a type of the
[1:29:58] spiritual Abraham believed God's promise
[1:30:01] and This Promise applies to the believer
[1:30:05] um we're going to get into it as we go
[1:30:07] on I'm probably running ahead of myself
[1:30:08] a bit but if we have faith in the
[1:30:11] promise of God we are Abraham's seed
[1:30:13] spiritually this is what the picture is
[1:30:16] showing
[1:30:22] so yeah and and the land that um the
[1:30:25] land that Abraham's seed was to
[1:30:28] possess
[1:30:30] um as a type of God's promises to the
[1:30:34] believer everything from salvation to if
[1:30:39] if we have a need healing every promise
[1:30:42] in the book is ours and and um and yeah
[1:30:47] the way I I I understand this is that
[1:30:49] the that promised land and also going to
[1:30:51] heaven is also part of our Promised Land
[1:30:54] um it's it's our inheritance so that's
[1:30:57] what canaan's land this
[1:31:00] place spiritually means for the believer
[1:31:03] um all of our promises it's our land but
[1:31:07] we have to fight for it as Abraham may
[1:31:09] not have known it but his seed would
[1:31:11] have had to fight to possess those
[1:31:13] promises it wasn't given to them on a
[1:31:15] platter um even
[1:31:17] though I mean salvation is as simple as
[1:31:21] believing it because it's yours Lord's
[1:31:23] done it you don't have to do do anything
[1:31:25] um but there's maybe battles in our life
[1:31:28] that we face that uh you know just walk
[1:31:32] through it and uh slay the giant slay
[1:31:35] the next one easy peasy you're probably
[1:31:38] going to fight and there's going to be
[1:31:39] blood sweet and tears but um but the
[1:31:41] Lord but the thing is do you believe
[1:31:43] that the Lord has given it to you he
[1:31:45] said it's yours and and as I said I'm
[1:31:47] preaching to myself here because
[1:31:50] sometimes our minds make yeah we
[1:31:53] probably over think things but
[1:31:56] um all right I I won't get off track
[1:31:59] we'll just keep
[1:32:05] going all right yeah just to um okay we
[1:32:08] put Romans four up there please um verse
[1:32:18] 13 I'm trying to go a bit fast because
[1:32:21] I've got a lot to go through but uh uh
[1:32:24] uh yeah so just just bear with
[1:32:29] me all right so that verse says for the
[1:32:32] promise that he should be the heir of
[1:32:34] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[1:32:36] seed through the law but through the
[1:32:38] righteousness of
[1:32:40] faith and if you drop down to verse
[1:32:44] 16 it says therefore is is of faith that
[1:32:47] it might be by grace to the end the
[1:32:49] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:32:52] not to that only which is of the law
[1:32:55] like natural Abraham seed but to that
[1:32:58] also which is of the faith of Abraham
[1:33:00] who is the father of us all so in the
[1:33:03] natural that picture of Abraham seed is
[1:33:05] painting a picture but what it's
[1:33:07] actually painting is in the spiritual do
[1:33:10] you believe God's promise and if you are
[1:33:12] if you do you are Abraham's
[1:33:16] seed and uh we'll just go back to our
[1:33:19] opening verse Hebrew 10 I'll I'll just
[1:33:22] rip it I'll put it up on here I've got
[1:33:23] it
[1:33:25] um so if we read that again it says for
[1:33:28] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:33:30] to come and not the very image of the
[1:33:32] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:33:35] which they offered year by year
[1:33:37] continually make the cers there unto
[1:33:39] perfect so all that Old Testament law
[1:33:42] all the sacrifices and
[1:33:44] things could not make us perfect because
[1:33:47] they were not the very
[1:33:49] image which is Jesus Christ coming and
[1:33:52] um and yeah completely obliterating sin
[1:33:57] and his life the Holy Spirit the
[1:34:00] brothers both brothers mentioned the the
[1:34:02] Holy Spirit and and being sealed you
[1:34:04] know the life of Jesus coming back on
[1:34:06] the believer that was the very image
[1:34:08] that was the hand that we talked about
[1:34:10] not the
[1:34:11] shadow so
[1:34:26] brother Ram says now as I expressed a
[1:34:28] few moments ago about reading between
[1:34:30] the lines but if you're reading between
[1:34:32] the lines and trying to make it say
[1:34:34] something that in between the lines says
[1:34:37] something different than what the line
[1:34:39] says then it's wrong but it's got to
[1:34:41] agree all the way through it the Bible
[1:34:44] is just like a great jigs or puzzle if
[1:34:46] you'll excuse the expression and if you
[1:34:48] just try to put it together just the way
[1:34:50] you look at it you've got to have
[1:34:52] something over here to look at
[1:34:54] if you don't you'll ruin your scene
[1:34:56] you'll have a cow picking grass on top
[1:34:59] of a tree Uh something's not quite right
[1:35:02] there uh so you know the Bible says lead
[1:35:05] not to your own understanding we should
[1:35:08] um yeah we should pray that the Lord
[1:35:12] reveals it to us otherwise yeah we might
[1:35:15] not get the picture so that's the way it
[1:35:18] is when you try to put the Bible
[1:35:20] together with a intellectual
[1:35:21] understanding of it you can't do it
[1:35:24] it's a spirit written word and it takes
[1:35:26] the Holy Spirit to place it together
[1:35:29] then you get the whole great picture
[1:35:30] from Eden out into chaos so what he's
[1:35:33] saying is from Eden I believe this is
[1:35:36] what he's saying from Eden all the way
[1:35:37] to the end of the world Satan and his
[1:35:41] imps going into
[1:35:43] chaos um so then you get that whole
[1:35:45] picture great picture from Eden out into
[1:35:49] chaos and the way of the Cross back home
[1:35:52] that's the entire picture God God's
[1:35:53] Redemption storying of story of sending
[1:35:56] his own son to redeem a lost and
[1:35:58] polluted people so once again all these
[1:36:01] Old Testament stories and things
[1:36:03] pointing to the great Redemption
[1:36:06] plan um of God sending his own son to
[1:36:10] redeem a lost and polluted
[1:36:17] people right so let's keep looking at uh
[1:36:21] Abraham I just put that picture up just
[1:36:23] something nice to look
[1:36:24] at
[1:36:27] um we'll just keep um on with Abraham
[1:36:30] and a seed and what happened to them in
[1:36:32] the
[1:36:35] natural so a certain amount of time
[1:36:38] after the Lord made the promise to
[1:36:41] Abraham that his seed will um all these
[1:36:44] promises to Abraham Sarah got impatient
[1:36:48] or maybe she didn't believe it at that
[1:36:50] time she did believe it in the end
[1:36:52] because the Bible says um Sarah judged
[1:36:54] them faithful who had promised um and so
[1:36:58] she she did she did believe in the end
[1:36:59] but at this time she said well Abraham
[1:37:02] I'll give you my maid servant Hagar
[1:37:05] maybe the Lord uh
[1:37:08] wanted uh you to have a son through her
[1:37:10] and then she'll give the son to me and
[1:37:12] I'll raise the son and thereby fulfill
[1:37:16] God's promise but that's not what the
[1:37:17] Lord
[1:37:21] said so yeah so s jum ahead of the
[1:37:24] promise of God by doing
[1:37:27] that um but it it didn't work so
[1:37:36] um but yeah so
[1:37:39] uh I guess I guess that's the same of us
[1:37:42] like we can do that sometimes but I'm
[1:37:44] thankful that in the end you know in the
[1:37:47] book of Hebrews it said through faith
[1:37:49] Sarah did this and through faith Abraham
[1:37:52] and through faith all the Believers it
[1:37:53] doesn't say anything about her doubting
[1:37:55] so in the end what actually mattered was
[1:37:57] Sarah believed so the Lord brought her
[1:38:00] through and same with us he'll
[1:38:03] um yeah he'll he'll bring us through
[1:38:05] those questions and things in our minds
[1:38:08] so
[1:38:10] um for lack of B
[1:38:13] words
[1:38:20] uh okay
[1:38:27] um all right so in Genesis 17 sometime
[1:38:30] later the Lord came to Abraham again
[1:38:33] this was very close to the time when
[1:38:35] Isaac was actually born and he said to
[1:38:37] Abraham the Bible says and when Abraham
[1:38:40] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[1:38:43] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:38:45] the almighty God walk before me and be
[1:38:48] thou
[1:38:49] perfect so this is quite amazing you
[1:38:52] know the Lord said to Abraham walk
[1:38:54] before me and be thou perfect and he
[1:38:58] requires me and you to walk before him
[1:39:00] and be perfect but not through our own
[1:39:03] effort because we cannot walk before him
[1:39:05] and be
[1:39:07] perfect and um you know the Bible says
[1:39:10] that our righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:39:12] so all of our efforts and trying are as
[1:39:14] filthy rags even though the believe the
[1:39:18] Lord sees the intents of our heart um
[1:39:21] but he sent a perfect sacrifice a
[1:39:23] perfect lamb Jesus Christ and if we have
[1:39:26] accepted that sacrifice then God doesn't
[1:39:28] see us he looks through his blood and he
[1:39:30] sees us perfect and
[1:39:37] sinless and Genesis 18 um it says and
[1:39:42] the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham
[1:39:44] that thing which I do actually if you
[1:39:46] can put that up please Genesis 18 verse1
[1:39:49] 17
[1:39:57] and the Lord said to Abraham uh and the
[1:39:59] Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that
[1:40:01] thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[1:40:05] shall surely become a great and mighty
[1:40:07] nation and all the nations of the Earth
[1:40:09] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[1:40:11] that he will command for I know him that
[1:40:14] he will command his children and his
[1:40:15] household after him and they shall keep
[1:40:18] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:40:20] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[1:40:22] Abraham that which he hath spoken of him
[1:40:26] so for the Lord to be able to bring that
[1:40:28] Covenant to pass in Abraham's life
[1:40:31] Abraham had to walk in the Lord's way
[1:40:33] and believe the promise
[1:40:36] um what if Abraham turned his back on
[1:40:39] God and walked away I don't I I can't
[1:40:41] see the Promise being fulfilled if he
[1:40:42] said no Lord I walk away I don't believe
[1:40:45] you but the Lord because he knew because
[1:40:48] Abraham was a son and daughter of God
[1:40:49] the Lord knew he would not do that
[1:40:54] so just the same way
[1:40:56] because the Lord knows his sons and
[1:40:59] daughters will keep his way
[1:41:02] um um he he knows that his sons and
[1:41:06] daughters will keep his way so that his
[1:41:08] promise can be fulfilled in their
[1:41:10] lives um even though it's actually him
[1:41:13] keeping us and not us holding on to him
[1:41:16] um
[1:41:27] I'll just find my place here
[1:41:34] quickly all right so there's a few times
[1:41:37] after this where um the Lord speaks to
[1:41:40] Abraham again and reminds him of his
[1:41:42] promise and says um just repeats it to
[1:41:46] him um and at one point Abraham actually
[1:41:49] said to God um oh that Ishmael might
[1:41:52] love before thee Lord is Ishmael the one
[1:41:55] you're going to bring this promise to
[1:41:56] pass through and then the Lord came to
[1:41:59] him and said no Sarah thy wife shall be
[1:42:02] the bear the a son indeed and thou shalt
[1:42:04] call his name Isaac and I will establish
[1:42:06] my Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[1:42:08] Covenant and with his seed after him as
[1:42:11] for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I
[1:42:14] have blessed him and will make him
[1:42:15] fruitful and will multiply him
[1:42:17] exceedingly 12 princes shall he beg get
[1:42:19] and I will make him a great nation but
[1:42:21] my Covenant I will establish with Isaac
[1:42:23] which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this
[1:42:25] set time in the next
[1:42:27] year so um yeah we all know the story of
[1:42:31] um King aimc wanting Sarah for wife and
[1:42:35] and then Abraham lying lying and saying
[1:42:38] she's my sister and how the Lord visited
[1:42:42] Abraham before going to Sodom and Sarah
[1:42:45] laugh in the tent when the Lord reminded
[1:42:46] Abraham of his
[1:42:49] promise but then the time came where the
[1:42:52] Lord fulfilled his promise so I love
[1:42:54] this verse um Genesis
[1:42:57] 21:1 says we'll put it up there please
[1:43:01] Talia
[1:43:05] um and the Lord visited Sarah as he had
[1:43:08] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[1:43:10] had spoken so 25 years after he made
[1:43:16] that first promise the promised son came
[1:43:18] and and and Isaac was born and it still
[1:43:21] didn't fulfill everything
[1:43:23] um Isaac still have to get children get
[1:43:26] many children many na uh
[1:43:29] um and the 12 tribes of Israel so Israel
[1:43:32] is obviously the descendants of
[1:43:35] Abraham all right um I've got way too
[1:43:39] much here I'm just going to I'm just
[1:43:43] going to cut down a bit so if we fast
[1:43:47] forward all this
[1:43:49] um it came a point where um
[1:43:54] uh we all know the story of Joseph and
[1:43:57] how they ended up in um in
[1:44:00] Egypt
[1:44:02] um and and how they multiplied and the
[1:44:06] Egyptians started oppressing them and uh
[1:44:11] and before Moses came on the SE and the
[1:44:13] Lord took them out of Egypt so I just
[1:44:16] want to drop something in here I don't
[1:44:17] know how many of you guys knew that
[1:44:19] Joseph was a type once again a type or a
[1:44:22] shadow
[1:44:23] um of
[1:44:25] Jesus because if you look at Joseph's
[1:44:28] life it parallels very nice with the
[1:44:32] life of Jesus so Joseph was loved by his
[1:44:35] father but hated by his Brethren and so
[1:44:38] was
[1:44:39] Jesus um you know when the the spirit of
[1:44:42] God ascended on him like a dove and said
[1:44:45] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:44:47] pleased um but the Jews hated him
[1:44:50] because he was a prophet and a spiritual
[1:44:53] person and they called him
[1:44:55] beab um his Brethren the Jews hated him
[1:44:59] and when Joseph was cast into prison
[1:45:02] after P's wife falsely accused him um
[1:45:06] and he went down uh into prison and met
[1:45:08] the Butler and the
[1:45:10] baker
[1:45:14] um uh Joseph had the Butler and the
[1:45:17] baker I think had the dreams and Joseph
[1:45:18] interpreted them and one of them was uh
[1:45:23] um was basically put to death by pharaoh
[1:45:25] and the other one
[1:45:27] was um forgiven or proven to be not
[1:45:30] guilty and he was um brought back into
[1:45:33] service to pharoh he was um just the
[1:45:36] same as that um on the cross when Jesus
[1:45:39] died the one
[1:45:41] Thief did not um revile Jesus and and
[1:45:45] and he went to hell and the other Thief
[1:45:48] was forgiven he asked for mercy so
[1:45:50] there's that type and
[1:45:53] once Joseph came out of prison he was
[1:45:56] exalted to the right hand of um pharaoh
[1:46:00] and after Jesus was crucified and rose
[1:46:03] again he was exalted to the right hand
[1:46:04] of
[1:46:06] God
[1:46:08] um and Joseph took a a gentile bride do
[1:46:12] you guys know what Gentile means I'm
[1:46:14] sure you do it means not a Jew so in the
[1:46:18] Bible there's essentially the Bible
[1:46:21] talks about three people so Jews
[1:46:24] Gentiles which are not Jews and
[1:46:26] Samaritans which are half Jew or part
[1:46:28] Jew and part Gentile so so Joseph
[1:46:32] actually married a he married um I'm not
[1:46:36] sure if it was pharoh's daughter but um
[1:46:38] he married an Egyptian a gentile and
[1:46:42] Jesus Christ took a gentile bride we are
[1:46:46] Gentiles
[1:46:51] um yeah so so the life of Joseph was
[1:46:55] another um type in the Old Testament
[1:46:57] pointing to Calvary and Jesus coming to
[1:47:00] Earth and and his great Redemption
[1:47:06] plan so yeah so after all this um when
[1:47:11] they multiplied in Egypt and a pharaoh
[1:47:14] um raised up which didn't know Joseph
[1:47:17] they started oppressing the Israelites
[1:47:19] and um and and then Moses came on the
[1:47:22] scene all right
[1:47:26] oh but God had already told Abraham that
[1:47:29] this was going to happen so yeah excuse
[1:47:31] me if this is Bland but it's it's
[1:47:33] probably just a history lesson like it's
[1:47:35] nice to see from the start how the Lord
[1:47:38] called Abraham how everything happened
[1:47:41] and yeah and the picture it
[1:47:51] paints right
[1:47:54] so so we know the Lord made the promise
[1:47:57] to
[1:47:58] Abraham Abraham was long off the scene
[1:48:01] by now and then the Lord brought Moses
[1:48:04] into the picture to fulfill that promise
[1:48:07] so the Bible says and when the Lord saw
[1:48:09] that he turned aside this is now the
[1:48:11] burning
[1:48:12] bush um that um the Lord spoke to Moses
[1:48:15] out of when the Lord saw that he turned
[1:48:18] aside to seea God called unto him out of
[1:48:21] the midst of the Bush and said Moses
[1:48:23] Moses and he said here am I and he said
[1:48:26] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[1:48:28] from off thy feet for the place where on
[1:48:30] thou standest is Holy
[1:48:33] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[1:48:36] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:48:38] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[1:48:41] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[1:48:43] God and the Lord said I have surely seen
[1:48:46] the Affliction of my people which are in
[1:48:48] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[1:48:51] of their taskmasters for I know their
[1:48:53] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[1:48:56] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:48:58] and to bring them up out of that land
[1:49:00] unto a land a good land and a large unto
[1:49:03] a land flowing with milk and honey unto
[1:49:06] the place of the Canaanites and all the
[1:49:08] other
[1:49:10] ites now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[1:49:12] children of Israel has come unto me and
[1:49:15] I have also seen the oppression where
[1:49:16] with the Egyptians oppressed them come
[1:49:19] now therefore and I will send thee unto
[1:49:21] Pharaoh that thou mightest bring my
[1:49:22] people the children of Israel out of
[1:49:26] Egypt
[1:49:29] so to
[1:49:32] me uh the children of Israel being in
[1:49:34] Egypt is a type of us being some of us
[1:49:38] came out of the world some of us were
[1:49:39] raised in a Christian family but we
[1:49:41] still had to come to a point where we
[1:49:44] came we come out
[1:49:45] of um we still have to come to a point
[1:49:48] where we accept Jesus Christ as our
[1:49:49] savior and make a decision and come out
[1:49:51] of our Egypt so so to speak and and once
[1:49:55] they came out of Egypt um they were on
[1:49:59] their Journey to the promised land and
[1:50:04] um and you know the Bible talks about
[1:50:08] the task Masters and the Egyptians being
[1:50:11] hard on the
[1:50:14] Israelites uh but though that was
[1:50:18] because you know the time was coming for
[1:50:20] the Lord to deliver them of those
[1:50:21] Egyptians and I believe that sometimes
[1:50:24] the Lord allows troubles in our lives um
[1:50:27] and things to become Grievous because
[1:50:30] it's time for us to be delivered from
[1:50:32] those
[1:50:32] things and he wants but but for him to
[1:50:35] be able to move and deliver you you need
[1:50:37] to be at a place of desperation where
[1:50:39] you say Lord I don't want this anymore
[1:50:42] so he can deliver you from it um if
[1:50:45] we're happy to live with them but don't
[1:50:47] want to be delivered you won't be
[1:50:49] delivered you've got to want it
[1:50:57] all
[1:51:00] right we won't be long we'll be just
[1:51:02] another 15 minutes I
[1:51:14] think so brother bam says now they've
[1:51:18] had many exoduses of course but I'm
[1:51:20] speaking on the time that God called in
[1:51:22] Exodus a separation from where they
[1:51:26] were at the present time here God is
[1:51:29] making ready to fulfill his Divine
[1:51:31] promised word that he had give to
[1:51:33] Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob years
[1:51:36] hundreds of years had passed but yet God
[1:51:38] never forgets his promise in the season
[1:51:41] the due time God always makes his
[1:51:43] promise
[1:51:45] right therefore you can rest assured
[1:51:48] that what God has promised in this Bible
[1:51:50] he's going to do it just kn need of
[1:51:52] trying to think anything else and say
[1:51:55] well the prophet was maybe was wrong or
[1:51:58] that couldn't happen in this day looked
[1:52:00] almost impossible then more impossible
[1:52:02] than it does now but God did it anyhow
[1:52:05] because he promised he would do
[1:52:07] it amen so yeah so it make take many
[1:52:11] years for things to happen but if God
[1:52:14] said it is going to
[1:52:18] happen all right
[1:52:20] so we all know how the children of
[1:52:23] Israel traveled through the Wilderness
[1:52:25] after Egypt and many things happened and
[1:52:27] they came to Kadesh Bania just before
[1:52:29] the promised land and um and they sent
[1:52:34] in 12 Spies and 10 of them came back and
[1:52:36] said no we can't do it we're not
[1:52:38] able um and Joshua and Caleb said no we
[1:52:41] are able because the Lord said we're
[1:52:44] able um but because of that so because
[1:52:48] of of of the majority of them saying no
[1:52:51] we can't do it they had to go another 40
[1:52:54] years in the wilderness and all those
[1:52:55] people that said we can't do it died in
[1:52:57] the wilderness so you can see how God
[1:53:00] hated it when they said we can't do it
[1:53:01] because he said I've I've given it to
[1:53:04] you I will do
[1:53:05] it
[1:53:08] um so um in Joshua verse one it says
[1:53:14] Moses my servant is dead now therefore
[1:53:16] arise go over this Jordan thou and all
[1:53:19] this people unto the land which I do
[1:53:21] give them even to the children children
[1:53:22] of
[1:53:25] Israel
[1:53:27] so remember how we said all these things
[1:53:29] paints a picture and it all mean
[1:53:33] something so that Covenant that God made
[1:53:36] with Abraham also types A Spiritual
[1:53:37] Covenant God made with his church and
[1:53:40] every
[1:53:41] believer and as we said um the promised
[1:53:44] land is a type of all the promises God
[1:53:48] made to his to to the believer in his
[1:53:50] word um and that Promised Land there's
[1:53:53] eternal life there's healing there's
[1:53:54] overcoming there's forgiveness every
[1:53:57] Redemptive blessing written in the Bible
[1:53:59] is in that Promised Land but we've got
[1:54:01] to fight to possess
[1:54:02] it so to carry on
[1:54:06] Joshua uh the Bible says Moses my
[1:54:09] servant is dead now therefore arise go
[1:54:12] over this Jordan thou and all this
[1:54:14] people unto the land which I do give
[1:54:17] them even to the children of Israel
[1:54:20] every place at the sole of your foot
[1:54:22] shall sh upon that have I given unto you
[1:54:24] as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[1:54:27] and this Lebanon even unto the Great
[1:54:29] River the river
[1:54:30] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[1:54:33] and under the great sea towards the
[1:54:34] going down of the sun shall be your
[1:54:36] Coast there shall not be any man be
[1:54:40] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:54:42] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:54:45] speaking to Joshua as I was with Moses
[1:54:48] so will I be with thee I will not fail
[1:54:50] thee nor forsake thee be strong strong
[1:54:52] and of a good courage For unto this
[1:54:54] people shalt thou divide for an
[1:54:56] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:54:58] their fathers to give
[1:55:00] them amen
[1:55:02] so um the brothers talked this morning
[1:55:05] about the Holy Spirit and being born
[1:55:06] again so what gives us the right to
[1:55:09] possess all these promises in our
[1:55:12] land um the Holy Spirit brother Braham
[1:55:15] says the holy spirit is the
[1:55:17] token um the token that we um that gives
[1:55:21] us a right to all all these
[1:55:23] promises he says now we want to check
[1:55:25] ourselves just for a
[1:55:27] moment when God gives you the true
[1:55:29] baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life
[1:55:31] of Jesus Christ is within you now that's
[1:55:34] true and every Theologian will have to
[1:55:36] admit that to be yes sir is the new
[1:55:38] birth you're born and new of the Holy
[1:55:41] Ghost and because that God has did this
[1:55:43] and you know you're no good in yourself
[1:55:46] and you accept what God has did then he
[1:55:49] seals you into his kingdom by the Holy
[1:55:51] Spirit and everything that Jesus
[1:55:53] purchased and promised you in the Bible
[1:55:55] is yours it's your property it's your
[1:55:58] property because it's paid for amen life
[1:56:01] is mine he paid for it life is yours he
[1:56:04] paid for it healing is mine he paid for
[1:56:06] it healing is yours he paid for it
[1:56:09] freedom is mine he paid for it Heaven is
[1:56:11] mine he paid for it he has paid the
[1:56:14] price everything he purchased belongs to
[1:56:16] the man that holds the
[1:56:18] token so we can see how important it is
[1:56:22] to have the Holy Spirit and I believe
[1:56:25] that if you don't have it or you're not
[1:56:28] sure if you open your heart the Lord
[1:56:31] will give it it's like um it's like
[1:56:33] brother Brandon mentions about that 100
[1:56:35] foot pipe in the sky imagine a massive
[1:56:38] long pipe with water in it like hundreds
[1:56:41] of hundreds of meters in the sky um the
[1:56:45] pressure at the bottom that water trying
[1:56:46] to come out that's like the pressure of
[1:56:48] God the Holy Spirit over every life if
[1:56:51] you open up to him he will rush into
[1:56:58] you brother B says and then if you are
[1:57:02] Christians you have a right a legal
[1:57:04] right for everything that Christ died
[1:57:06] for it's your possession you own it it's
[1:57:08] yours now the only thing that you can is
[1:57:12] to do like Abraham after he had endured
[1:57:15] a fight he obtained the promise Satan
[1:57:17] just don't let you take it easy you've
[1:57:19] got to have faith you've got to believe
[1:57:21] it you've got to
[1:57:23] God told those Moses said that land
[1:57:26] belongs to you and yet it was all fenced
[1:57:28] up with Philistines and everything else
[1:57:30] he said it's yours I have give it to you
[1:57:33] now go take
[1:57:35] it Divine Healing is to every one of you
[1:57:38] it belongs to you now can you go take it
[1:57:41] go take it this
[1:57:47] morning and um and another sermon he
[1:57:50] says like it is today many have looked
[1:57:52] for these things and yet they don't
[1:57:54] recognize them they don't realize the
[1:57:56] way out they still trying to seek
[1:57:58] pleasures and things of the world trying
[1:58:00] to find their way out there was been
[1:58:03] many signposts that pointed to that day
[1:58:06] many great foreshadows it had been
[1:58:08] foreshadowed by the Lamb by the bulock
[1:58:10] by the turtle dove and all of these
[1:58:11] things but yet could not break
[1:58:14] it um it could not break that death hold
[1:58:17] where Satan had the Earth
[1:58:23] and I want you to notice where it says
[1:58:25] there um what at 50 paragraph 59 there
[1:58:30] was there's been many sign posts that
[1:58:32] pointed to that day and that day is
[1:58:34] Calvary so it all points to Calvary and
[1:58:38] the Plan of Redemption and what God is
[1:58:39] doing in this day and the spiritual
[1:58:42] battle we find ourselves in as Believers
[1:58:44] to take our promised
[1:58:46] land and even though it's hard I mean we
[1:58:48] all can say it's hard the Lord said it
[1:58:51] is yours I've given it to you so I pray
[1:58:53] that the Lord helps us to be able to
[1:58:55] take him at his word and and possess our
[1:58:59] land and by his grace we
[1:59:08] will yeah so um yeah forgive me if this
[1:59:12] was very chopped up but I I hope at
[1:59:15] least um uh we can see the picture um
[1:59:20] that throughout the lives of all those
[1:59:22] Old Testament Believers Abraham Moses
[1:59:25] David Ruth and Boaz it's all painting
[1:59:28] something to come um like Hebrews 10
[1:59:31] said I'll pull that up
[1:59:34] again for the law having a shadow of
[1:59:37] good things to
[1:59:40] come um yeah so all the lives of those
[1:59:43] Believers painted a picture and today we
[1:59:46] are walking out in
[1:59:47] it
[1:59:49] um yeah so I'll just finish with this
[1:59:53] one quote
[1:59:55] um and then I'm off the
[1:59:59] hook
[2:00:02] uh yeah I'm so glad that a man can live
[2:00:05] so close to God till the devil don't
[2:00:07] know what to do with him yeah I don't
[2:00:10] feel I'm there yet I don't know if
[2:00:11] you're there yet but I believe if yeah
[2:00:14] if the prophet said it um we can have
[2:00:18] that and I believe we will have that so
[2:00:21] yeah amen can uh we just have the
[2:00:24] musicians and brother Ben can you come
[2:00:26] up
[2:00:26] [Applause]
[2:00:37] please can we sing Father
[2:00:40] Abraham but I don't want to lead
[2:00:45] it okay we don't have
[2:00:48] to okay
[2:00:58] amen praise the Lord as we heard fish
[2:01:01] saying you got to have a personal walk
[2:01:02] with God I like the the hidden reservoir
[2:01:04] of oil there it's a SE rapturing faith
[2:01:07] is a secret between you and God I mean
[2:01:09] the world don't know about it but you
[2:01:11] know it amen praise the Lord now I was
[2:01:13] thinking about the um Covenant brother M
[2:01:15] come here again sorry come here so you
[2:01:18] know you know how the Devil comes to you
[2:01:20] and tells you you're not an over come
[2:01:22] you can't have Victory you're never
[2:01:24] going to get out of this you're not
[2:01:26] really a Christian right so God he took
[2:01:29] the coven right who this
[2:01:33] is that's your heart right then the
[2:01:36] Devil comes along and tries to tell you
[2:01:39] what is part of your
[2:01:41] Covenant right so he tries to tell you
[2:01:44] you can't win you're never going to out
[2:01:45] this you never going to be free you're
[2:01:47] not really a Christian you have
[2:01:48] rapturing faith what you need to do is
[2:01:50] look at your
[2:01:53] and try and match it with what he's
[2:01:55] telling you and you'll find out what
[2:01:57] he's trying to tell you doesn't match
[2:01:58] what God's given you right amen thank
[2:02:02] you for that amen so I think we should
[2:02:04] just we should take everything the devil
[2:02:06] tells us back to the Covenant God has
[2:02:09] given us we say hey this ain't matching
