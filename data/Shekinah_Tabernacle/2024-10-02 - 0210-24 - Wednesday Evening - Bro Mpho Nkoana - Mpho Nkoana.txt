aming God Amazing Grace amen what an amazing grace we have amen amen an ending love amen amen I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ tonight so I was just a bit nervous because I don't get used to stand here so let's just read the word of God and then I'll let you sit down and then we can we can start to to forget what happened today and listen to to to the word of God let's read in the book of my favorite uh chapter lately that's lately this is my favorite chapter thank you so much musicians for getting us in the atmosphere thanks brother Marion God bless you and brother Marion was going to ask me to pray and he realized that brother PO is preaching so he didn't want to give me double job so thank you and let's read Romans chapter 8 it's my favorite chapter lately but we'll just read I would like us to read a lot more but let's just read two verses and then we see we pray and sit down are we all there once you are there just say Amen it's a powerful verse man if you just read this verse with me there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life is in Christ Jesus ha made me me he has made me H me free from the law of sin and death our heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ father what can we say to these things Lord it just humbles us to realize that father out of billions and billions and billions of people that you could foree and choose but you chose me Lord me and an insignificant human being from insignificant people from born by a father and a mother in the way of sin Lord you chose me Father God and you chose each and every one of us we are so privileged father we want to thank you for reading your word tonight we know that anyone can open this Bible read it even better than us that is why we are asking you Lord to come tonight and Inspire it get me out of the way father because there's nothing that I can do to your for your people come and speak come and use the lips of this men lord to bless your people thank encourage them Lord to motivate them Lord to reassure them Lord let your word heal them tonight let every desire every need be answered father we commit the service into your hands in the name of our Lord and savior our loving father Our Redeemer Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can sit um I want to welcome my dear friend H rhyo at the back there thanks for coming Rhino and uh Rhino I told him that hey I'm I'm I'm the one who's preaching tonight he said ah I'll come I said but look don't come because because I'm preaching I'm actually I can't I can't give you anything but I invited him before I knew that I was going to preach today because R Rhino is my sorry to put on the sport Buddha because he he's the one who sold me a little car that you see me driving around here H so but because the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord I don't believe it was about the car so we started talking about God and here here is Right visiting us with us tonight may God bless you my brother he has F said Africa off so what I meant by that for for you Q is that he's also from South Africa so welcome righto and just feel free at home all these are brothers and sisters talk to anyone after the service if you you want to when they approach you they just love you it's because we are Christians so just feel at home and uh only take what I say not what about who about me so may God bless you tonight we have read we have read this powerful scripture and if you listen to verse two it talks about H for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus ha made me free from the law of sin and death that's initially that's what I wanted to speak speak about which we I can't talk about tonight we'll talk about it some other time but that thought is just so powerful these two laws are so powerful I wanted us to talk about them more in the context of the greatest battle that is being fought right now but we'll talk about this some other time somehow along the way the Lord just changed my thoughts and inspired me to speak about led by the spirit being led by the spirit so and as usual if you just hear me calling your name please don't take offense I I mean it in a good way I just mean to engage and to participate with you I don't mean to put you on the sport I I like when I talk for people to follow what I'm trying to say so the only way that I do that is to say Hey you get it David you know so just like when you talk I want you to understand that I'm attentively listening to you I was remanded One Time by my dear sister K but by not looking at her when she was greeting me so so I know that when someone talks to you pay attention to them so it's good to have Elders Among Us and and and listen to them I like sister K because she she's sister K so brothers and sisters I won't be long tonight but I want us to look at this thought of being led by the spirit and uh just take a few a few uh things around this thought brother bham the messenger of this hour preached this sermon a few times and H using different titles and but it just set on my heart to be led by the spirit you know it's such a deep H topic for me to be led by the spirit it has got so many aspects and I don't have a spreadsheet tonight I mean a PowerPoint I'll just go through my notes and my notes are are available for you if you want me to email you to read them um but let's just understand what is the meaning or the context of this word lead to be led what because many times we just say words and we speak them without internalizing them to be led in the context of what we are talking about here today tonight is that you know to be led you've got to have been surrendered right to be led you you you you must agree and uh can you imagine a sheep that I'm leading and I'm I'm the shepherd but that that does not has not fully surrendered me as a she to me as a Shepherd it will get lost the Wolves and the J calls can grab it because it goes astray it goes different ways it does different things and it's here in the in the flock but it's not here so to be led has got a lot of a lot to do with also surrendering you know giving yourself amen so it's not about you or me continuing to have self trust you know it's about letting go letting everything that you can do for yourself to know that Jesus Christ can do it better for you so so so so so all you human capabilities means nothing when it comes to surrendering being led by the Lord all of them they are secondary right the primary person becomes the leader the one who whom is leading you in other words when you make decisions when you when you think when you process things when you live your life daily you are under this leading so you also have to be able to to to to to to be sensitive to to this one that is leading you to his instructions to his uh H you know coachings because he's your Mentor he's everything to you we read there that he's he's he's got an amazing love he's our friend our father he's everything to us so you need to be able to to know your Shepherd and and and and be led by his instruction by his spirit amen so that is the context that I want us to be and also to be sensitive about what what he want you to do because if you are not careful you can actually agree and want to do that but if you are not sensitive if you're not careful all what is teaching you can pass you above the head because you're not being sensitive you're not being careful I mean you know the holy spirit is sensitive very sensitive and I Was preparing the suon and then somehow I just went out and I saw this pigeon called a a that is a pigeon yeah it's a wild pigeon and those Bears they are very sensitive they eat seeds they they don't just eat anything and find a dead dog and start eating there or they're sensitive like the holy spirit is the holy spirit is is so sensitive even if you are the Son of God and you offend the Holy Spirit he's not happy you'll stand there and you you repent he comes you see but that does not change the fact that you are a son of God but don't offend him be sensitive what I'm trying to we're not talking about offending the Holy Spirit we're just talking about being sensitive to the spirit of the Lord and being sensitive to the spirit of the Lord it means you'll also be sensitive to the people of God because those people have got God inside them they've got the spirit of the living you'll be sensitive to them when you talk to them when you deal with them when you think about them when you engage with them you you'll be sensitive because you you are dealing with God am I right so that's the context of this word lead to be led the the attitude of I know doesn't work there me and my studies and my wisdom whatever I can think of is zil is there such a word zero yes is zero it means Z zero I just want to emphasize that about me it means nothing I'm nothing before the Lord my thinking my whatever even the most intelligent person amen but let's go back to this chapter because I love it so much and and I'll jump I'll hop between different uh verses uh like brother Greg was doing but I want to you to look at the this chapter every every time where I read what the word says about the spirit right let's just go on and jump to verse four but let's just let's just go from verse three where we ended for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God seen in In the Flesh sorry is that right that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so we walk after the spirit verse five for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so it's already showing you there's two if you mind the things of the flesh you're that side or you thinking you you can be a son and daughter of God and just have this thorn of just minding the that must be removed so that the Holy Spirit can completely lead you right for to be kindly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace that's for you and I'm not kidding if you listen to this chapter first verse it opens up with a promise for you there is therefore now no more condemnation this is a guarantee it's a promise right through this chapter if you read it you find your promises I didn't give them to you God gave them to you they're yours but he wants me and you to be led by him at all times and to learn to know how he operates and the only way to learn to know God and to experience him is through the spirit of the Living God no capacity no ability of men can teach you through that process it's only through the spirit so I cannot overemphasize the importance of ensuring that you have the Holy Spirit of the Living God and you cry before God to give it to you so that he can lead you because it's much easier when you is you sealed in inside your soul and you're closed have you ever seen a te a tin of H I don't want to say Coke because Coke you can just press like this and says and open it a tin of like you know beans not this new ones with a little Clips is like no no a sealed one the one we open with the te open ch ch ch that one it's sealed it's sealed completely closed it's like you when the Holy Spirit is sealed you huh it's much easier when you make an error when you it's much easier for you to be sensitive to the spirit because we are still fighting this guy yeah so he will come and bother the old nature will come but when you has inside sealed it's much easier it works out much the the way God wants it to work but if the holy spirit is still in the periphery if the holy spirit is still just in the in just inner the inner court is still around there you are a son of God but walk that Journey to the End I don't want to go deep now now let's go to verse seven because the caral mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be right let's jump to verse 9 oh sorry verse 8 so they that are in the flesh cannot please God so I thought without faith you can't please God without If You In the Flesh that means you don't have the faith let's be careful okay let's be very careful on a this what I'm trying to talk to you tonight is about our daytoday walk it's about our minute to minute walk it's about our hour to hour walk our hour to hour thoughts our life you know when you've got when your life is centered around you you it does not Tire you or bother you to think about him every time in fact it becomes an experience when you walk and you say I wonder why what does my Lord think about this because you are in a relationship with him you are walking with him and you'll see as you grow in the Lord that the Lord makes things open for you you start to to communicate ah Lord I didn't know you this way in me in the olden days I never used to to to do something and think that if the Lord is willing I never right but nowadays when I don't know what makes that if you are led by the spirit he makes you to think hey I want to do that thing if the Lord is willing because he's always there he's he's very careful he he cannot afford to lose you he wants you every time to do things right when you think when you talk so being led by the spirit is a wonderful thing now let's talk about some few quotations then we go home but I just want to read a few more in inside this chapter I'll be just take a quote from Brother bam from the spoken word and then link it to a verse maybe inside this chapter otherwise if I just read the whole chapter now you may not be able to get as I get to a quote that I want to quote in the message oh yeah I forgot to also read for you Luke 2:25 this one is there's many in the Bible that we find these people that were led by the spirit but this particular one the way the man of God dramatizes him him about how he was led by the spirit the Holy Spirit promised him that you cannot die until you see the Messiah amen it's a beautiful story if you listen to how he dramatized and you know he was talking about how when Mary Mary Mary after burying the Lord then it was a custom for all the Jewish to take Jewish women to take their children to the temple to be circumcised on a certain day and also they will bring a sacrifice right if you don't have a sheep you'll just bring a ttle dove and then you ask your sacrifice and then maybe he'll say maybe it will been a beautiful morning on on that beautiful morning then all the human are going there who had children and then then maybe they queuing can you see them queuing and waiting for the priest you know and to to do their sacrifice and then as they come there there was this one little girl who was also just at the corner nobody wanted to be next to her because she had an illegitimate child soall nobody wanted to be next to her you know and then as they come along and and that priest came from the the Holy Spirit the Bible says as we read here luk says who can read it for me I like to engage people sorry what should I do I must say one two one two yeah who's going to read for me as you just keep it brother to read for me Jimmy right Luke 2:25 let's let's let's hear about this man again behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the man was just a devout waiting on the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon Him ah the Holy Spirit was upon this man that is why the Holy Spirit could tell him go out and then he went out as he walk on the Queue and then he found this little girl who was holding the Messiah and then his eyes saw the Messiah he said Lord now I can die because my eyes have behold the Messiah so because he was he was led by the spirit he was led by the holy SP Spirit when you are led by the Holy Spirit people can think that you are not normal people will think that you are actually insane because actually in in the worldly way in the flesh way you are you are not normal you are up above normal not below above because the things that you do are not of the flesh you are led by the spirit you you are an old ball don't be surprised don't question why am I like this why people no no know who you are because you are an odd ball don't be surprised when you certain then you just don't find this world accept easy for you to live because you must know who you are so when you are led by the spirit you find that you you you you can do certain things that we don't what's wrong with Naomi no no if I can only know or be in the spirit of what what then I will know what Nai is doing what he's going through the people who are led by the spirit don't follow much about the things of the flesh they led by the spirit I'm going to read first quotation for you when the people take God at his word and believe his promise it is so Supernatural till it becomes crazy to the people of the world the people think that you are not okay so therefore we must not try to be okay no no we mustn't try to conform to be okay to adaptable to the world no no we just live according to the word of God let it break wherever it breaks huh so it so I won't read the whole thing but I just wanted to tell you that when you are led by God and you believe the promise of God you see a man and a woman can promise you something and then they make it sure that they promising you they even sign on the contract brother Callen and they promise prise you but it can happen that they can fail to fulfill their promise because they are human we are human being even governments politicians are even worse we normal people I can promise that sister Mike I'll come help you and I can fail to come help you you understand even if I promised then I phone and I apologize and expect you to understand even you a sister there then I don't come but that's human nature we fail but you see when God promises you he never fails when he says to you there is no more condemnation in other words you are not condemned under sin the law of sin anymore that's for real he means that and you see God is not a man that he can lie when whatever he says we take it raw as it is because what he said it must come to happen because he does not operate about the law of sin and death he operates according to the law of Life the law that says Let There Be and there is if he says i' I save you that's it brother no need for you to question to doubt to to to analyze it when he says I've saved you that's it I just you just take it like that and all you need to do you is to allow yourself to be led by him right because because if God can fail to fulfill this then then he's not God you see otherwise for God to be God everything that he says comes to pass am and he makes him God and that is above everything because no us we fail we say I come I fail I promise you brother KU that I'll come to eat your dinner I fail you see so we fail we human being and we fail also one we fail one another that is why the Lord said we must forgive one another because we fail one another we disappoint one another but but the people who are led by the spirit they find it easy to forgive they find it easy to forgive even without you asking them because he said people who are led by the spirit have got long suffering we'll read Galatians you'll hear about Galatians let's continue quote number two amen this this word of God Is Power powerful I like to stop here just a moment to say this if you make a oh this is what I told you if you make a promise I was just trying to paraphrase about that I'll jump this one so that we can save time but you heard me about when God promised oh yeah when God promis when he says I will heal you brother and sister he means that in fact when he says I have healed you just take it like that it's like how how can I explain this it's like you you just take it like that as is as it faith is so simple but many times we fail to get it because it's so easy but yet so powerful when is when Sister Jenny says yes come to my place and eat you won't go there and find she lock the door she's gone no you'll find her there right and we don't question that we just go that's EXA faith is like you just go to your car and start without even thinking that is faith that is capable enough to heal cancer that's as easy as that the problem is that our the law of Flesh complicates it to weaken our faith and it's so easy Lord you said you've heal I just I'm Healed I'm Healed don't make me think about he said I've healed you done because otherwise God is not a liar so what he said he said it all my duty is just to make sure that I am led by him I love him I I I because that's the first commandment with all my heart with all my soul and just follow what he says in his word and in in any way he said he'll walk with me he'll make my B and easy so why are Christians so tossed about why why does it appear as the world huh now I want to talk about mortifying yourself and now this will be linked to verse uh verse 13 of the chapter for if ye live after the flesh he shall die but if you you you you through the spirit you do motify the Deeds of the body shall live now I looked at this word motify amen it's not a day a a word that we use on a daily basis the root the root of the verb motify is from the Latin word mors which means death to motify something used to mean to destroy its life huh so that's the origin the origin of the word mortify so doesn't that take you back to that the flesh must die I must die to myself and let him live in me I must mortify now in in the modern day English it means you know when you em to embarrass to bring to shame the Deeds of the flesh to to disown them so let I just wanted to to to underline that word also the word surrender to full surrender to be led by the spirit you've got to be fully surrendered you don't want the Lord to lead you part- timely therefore I must not worship Him worship Him part Ely by the way all these things that I'm saying to you here brothers and sisters I'm actually wanting the Lord to tell me more yes yes because the minister is the first one sorry brother Ben know the pastor Pastor sitting behind you there that one is the pastor there if I say something wrong you talk to you now you see the minister is the first one to be led by the spirit imagine if I come here and I tell you to be to be led by the spirit but I didn't set myself aside prayerfully and seek God's ways without my analogy without saying Lord lead me take my mouth take everything aside let me speak only what you want then how can I help you to show you to be led by the spirit you understand so we have got a big task ministers I think theyard me because I'm one of them and quote number three so if God was so pleased with Christ till he act he accepted him and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased and through Christ being the perfect one as dead to our own thoughts and ideas being born of the spirit of God walking not after the theology but after the spirit inside us then let the dead in Christ walk not after the things of the world but after the things of the spirit so this spirit is inside us so we learn to hear him we learn to talk to him we we learn over time as you pray as you get as that little button grows grows grows you say wow you see things better you talk to him better you are you are careful about him because he's careful about you you you worry about what the Lord how the Lord will take this you worry about my ah the way that I spoke to my sister it was not right ah the way that I I was thinking about that thing is not right because you're sensitive we'll get to the point now of being sensitive to the spirit see you are you your inside of Christ walking then all the things of the world pass away the great then all the GES that you had of this thing and of that thing is all vanished away and your heart and mind becomes singular on Christ Jesus that shows you have died to yourself and born again you see so don't be like I like what brother Greg said on Sunday he said he said the Queen the the sin question is done we are talking about the working now the journey that sin question the devil mustn't bring to you the devil must never come to you and threaten you about things that you did in 1909 that's right no the sin question is settled D all what is left now is the daily walk and even that just like the sin question was sorted even the walk it will come to Perfection one of these days that is why we come to church that is why we we read the sermons that we preached in 1960 that is why we read the Bible that was preaching in ad m m you see because we these things are there to remind us to to to make make sure that our button is growing is growing is growing before you know it one of these days we Rapture and go home just take heat to what he says he's there not even a preacher can bring him to you you and him is that relationship with him it is your personal duty to be a friend to Jesus a close friend dying to ourselves quick code number four I I wrote here brother and sister so many people laugh about baptism of the holy spirit it's only thing that that will save you that's the only thing that will save you not not another thing God has no other way provided but for me for men and women to be filled with the Holy Spirit and be led by the Holy Spirit correctly that's what he says here you see so the issue of being led by the spirit and being filled is so important is something that I would imagine on your daily tasks if you haven't received it it must be a a something that that is burning in your heart I want to baptism of the Holy Ghost and be sure that you have it and I don't believe that this a that we are you know we get different experiences we get I cannot explain to you how how is what's going to happen when he come and you experience him because he he make himself available he make himself he give you the experience and he anoint you in a unique special way each one has got a story or let me say a testimony of how because it's a personal relationship how can it be like mine when when when when it's a personal relationship it's a personal it's Unique because each one of us if there's this this level of speciality is special like this way like this before him there's no one who's no special and lesser special to him we are equally special and that's why the Lord showed us even through you know the fingerprints no one is got same fingerprints like you he took careful consideration to make you and the and that thing in the what do they call it the retina or what the retina oh sorry my my accent the retin now they ident he can identify you because no one has called one like yours so God is so careful and these things of the flesh are basically just trying to show you that hey he he made you you are so special to him that he even want his experience you and him that's why when he he said I'll find you in there on the third pool no one can teach you or tell tell you how that I'll find you in the experience is maybe one day the pastor will teach us about the let's meet up in the experience then you go and experience yours but it's not something it's it's a special spe but you must have it amen we're going to close now I check time because when there's visitors I know you can finish late now the work of the spirit there's works of the spirit and there's work of the flesh I know you don't do all those things of the work of the flesh it's the devil who can make you and me to be tricked into them some of them are just horrible and then let I just I want to read and bring a thought to you I want to read read it and then bring a thought to you Galatians 5 if it's possible sister um Talia you can display it if it's possible H I'll start from verse 16 Mel 5 ver 16 Galatians there right this is I then walk in the spirit walk in the spirit this is like an instruction walk in the spirit there's no jokes here when when when when the prophet saw the bride an overview of the Bride marching going he said I saw them of different nations and were of different colors and of different things and then at the end there towards the tail there there were some that went almost out of Step I said walk in line so it's an instruction you can't be a son and daughter of God and don't want to take instruction walk in line so walk in the spirit I'm not he's not asking you walk in the spirit you are a son of God you are a daughter of God don't don't mix the two don't confuse serious every day that's what it means every minute in it he says walk in the spirit and he shall not fulfill the last of the flesh for the flesh lth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that he would but if he be led of the spirit you are not under the law that law of the flesh right now the works of the flesh are manifest which are this now listen to this these are the works of the flesh adultery fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred VAR variance ulations wroth Strife seditions heresies envyings murderers I mean murders drunkness revealings such and such like now what Paul is telling you here of which I tell you before okay let me stop there you see this things that Paul wrote here that that list doesn't end there that is why he says and such like there are these are some of the strong ones but there are some that are not so strong the cousins of these ones the cousins and sisters and brothers demons are related they've got their cousins they skillful in different things and they help one another and some of them you can't one day I was talking to a brother he said Hey Brother the Lord revealed to me as I was praying I found that I had 45 demons that were attacking me that I need to deal with and I asked him can you tell me some of them what are those you can't believe some of the Demons things that we many times we just take like a light and and don't think that it's a this is a demon because why it comes disguised because it's a cousin of the cousin of the cousin of Envy is related but you know when he related down the line then you don't suspect it and it comes disguised so demons are like that right so we need to be know aware that this things that Paul read here we don't just say I don't do that that that that that that I'm good you must watch out and pray to be led by the spirit so that any of those and such like related to them how can how can how many demons did Legion have how can so many spirits be in one man and we hear that now in the days that we are living in 250 million were released from the river Euphrates and they here no wonder the people people don't want to pray every day no wonder people want to make other things idols and we want to make to we just feel tired and lazy do you think it's not a demon making you like that and we you just want you just oh I just I'm not I'm not feeling I'm just feeling upset what's that there an evil spirit around there you cast it and and you jump before you know it you're out of that that that we are supposed to dominate The Devil he's notos to dominate us oh no no I just I don't I don't I don't feel her I don't like her I don't know why that's a demo you just feel like ah you want to be extra beautiful I'm not saying it's wrong but check the spirit remember in as much as you must be led by the spirit of God and be sensitive you must also brother here I'll read for you he says also you must be sensitive and careful of the evil spirits and know how they operate and their moves you see you cannot just just just talk to the sister of a child of God in a certain way and you call yourself a brother maybe there could be and some some Spirit don't even want you to know that they there they hiding because they want to get them hibernate lay X later on hch that's how the devil work he was he a bad news guy the devil that all these ones that Paul spoke that's why Paul says and such like so God has made these things open and clear to us but most importantly the Holy Spirit once he's there he's going to just reveal show you with all these gifts and things that he gave to us but let's finish this scripture because really I can't just read just the The Works of the Flesh and leave it there let's hear the the works of the spirit of God oh yeah anding so I ended up there that um of of of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in the time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God and the devil know that Paul told you and he knows that you're going to watch for those things so he'll bring those cousins he'll bring those hidden ones those subtle demons I don't think and I didn't plan to say this but I don't think serpent went to Eve's house once no I think he was coming every day for coffee even when Adam was there until Adam used got used to him and ah this is the guy is a local guy and even when Adam was going out and Satan coming in he said oh no no I'll see you now I'm just going to do something I'll be back soon because he he said you know he was a he was he wanted to make himself a family friend I think he was coming every day that is why it was so easy to deceive Eve so be very careful about the familiar spirits that want to at and make you get used to them until you can't see your eyes can't see your reasoning can't understand that this is wrong let's be careful about those that wants to make themselves your family friends be very careful they want to come in this family and make themselves comfortable until you they use you to defend them and say no no this is right this is what did the prophet say that but how can I teach you sister brother you get let the spirit of God make sure you that is why it's so important that's the point number one to make sure you have let's read about we hear that those ones you can't inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love love joy peace longsuffering longsuffering meaning I must be patient with my brother even if he's doing something wrong to to me I I must be patient with people of the Holy Spirit are not normal we are above normal gentleness gentle goodness Faith weekness Temperance against such there's no law and I don't think this list is exhaustive it's not the things the holy spirit will make you do things that will say ah Christine you because it's the Holy Spirit I can tell you now I can converse there certain things that when brother Ben does I think ah this brother because he's led by the spirit of God only people who are led by the spirit will behave like this brother that's why I live I love him sorry brother been to put on the spot who else can I give an example he's our Shepherd so he'll be on the pedestal sometimes follow me as I follow Christ amen so and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust and if we live in the spirit if we live in the spirit let us also walk it's not a static settlement we walk because we are in a Journey so we walk Walking it mean that we are walking together when we are walking me and the spirit is in me and then I'm in him then we engage we talk we know we talk about things about my life and he tells me how Heaven is going to be that ah he even tells you that your ears and your eyes cannot understand but wait and see and then I I talk to him then I tell him I miss to go home and then we talk about that when you know another singer says you know me and the Lord had a talk about you then then then the Holy Spirit even bring words that you never thought and the Holy Spirit goes and and because he's careful about our infirmities also the Holy Spirit when he's leading you he's also careful about the things of the Flesh on your body your sickness is that you don't even know yourself when he he prays when he intercede for you he tells the Lord about those sicknesses that you don't know that are your body about some problems that you don't know that are waiting for you the Holy Spirit enter that's what happens when you walk and you are led by him he intercedes for you my wife was telling me about an accident an accident that happened last week it happened just just few seconds before them you saw it and it so because the the holy spirit is careful and even if we are careless he's still careful let's just not offend him and the only way not to in our caral flesh we can't make it is to allow him to come that's going to give us the ability or the way to be sensitive to him to be careful to be led by him it's not something that you can make yourself to do no in your ability as a human being I can't but him but allow him fully open open and then he comes fully fleshed and seal you you tell me the man it change the whole character of a man the the way you know brother let's say you know him as a talkative man he he suddenly not not like that why because something happened to you I don't know if I'll be able to be quiet lastly I wanted just to close with this one about you know the story when brother bham was there in Memphis about anima how can you the holy the the prophet said no he was they landed there and then he says H this is the middle of the story I'll paraphrase it because you know the story but what I want to tell you is that there was no vision that came to him he didn't see any Vision he didn't see the angel come to him he was just going to post the letters and then something things that turn back go that way and he thought he's hearing things it was and it was not an audible voice like hey David how are you no so now but the thing is this he obeyed he allowed himself to follow if someone stopped him and asked him what do you think he was going to say is that are you okay no no something said I must go this way 10 then he actually stopped some point wanted to no no go that way and but how can you explain that then he found the sister who had a vision a dream and prayed for that boy and he got healed and so when you are led by the spirit you must be sensitive to the spirit and ask the Lord Lord am I make me to be sensitive to the spirit to you when you talk so that I can hear you with that word that is not an audible voice because lord it's no argument that I'm your son so I would like to be sensitive to you when he's that's that's why I brought this quotation but I wanted just to summarize it because my time has run out so brothers and sisters lastly he says now we realize and everyone knows there are are spirits then if they there Spirits then there's bound to be a master of the spirit because it changes the nature of Sinners into Christians and they is bound to be the master the head there somewhere and that's God there's many spirits be very careful be very sensitive so be aware in our own capacity we can do it amen so I trust that I've blessed you with this few words and then you can go and read this poen called led by the spirit or you could go do me a favor go and read Romans chapter 8 I like it just the page I think if the page get loose I'll just do super because I like Romans chapter 8 lately just go read it and enjoy it
