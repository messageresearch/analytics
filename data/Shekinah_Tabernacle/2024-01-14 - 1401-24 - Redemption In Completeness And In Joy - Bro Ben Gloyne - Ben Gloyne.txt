power I'm working miracles I live a life of favor cuz I know who I am oh I know who I [Music] am I know who I am [Music] oh I know I know who I amen you can take your seats this morning it's important to know who we are you know I always think Paul when he when he he said I've fought a good fight I've kept the faith I know who I am I've done the right thing now I'm going to go into Glory you know he he he went with confidence and that's what we should how we should go we shouldn't be oh we're not sure who we are we're not we don't know no we know who we are we know we were G we're sure we walk in the light you know when you're in darkness you don't know where you are where am I that's why you see these crazy sort of hippie ideas that are just funny because there's no substance to it CU they don't know where they are new age ideas are just nonsense nothing ties together because it's Darkness but when you're walking in the light you know who you are you know where you're going amen I'm going to call out brother Ben we've got a special something this morning amen praise the Lord yes we do amen amen we're going to have a baby dedication this morning with little Ezekiel Al Alejandro for so do you want to is that right see close nearly not really aleandro I guess okay do you want to come forward though I mean let's sing that song as I come forward bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in bring the little to [Music] Jesus amen glory amen what a wonderful day what a wonderful time you know it's um it's it's such a tremendous thing when life comes into a family am we got a little bundle of joy here and um you know the Bible says that uh you as we follow the Bible way you know we don't baptize babies but we dedicate them to the Lord because the little ones came to Jesus and Jesus blessed them and we sure ain't the Lord Jesus but he still is the same God so just want to read uh just about his name because you know there's you know there's power in the name you know you notice that there's I've never met anyone called nabal in my life because nabal in the Bible means a fool you know I've never I've never met anyone called nabal you know says power in the name and um you know Ezekiel we know it means uh the strength of God and um alandro means defender of men or protector of mankind and I was thinking about eek in the Bible where you know he was would say in Ezekiel 24 and 24 that um I'll just read it here it says thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh you shall know that I am the Lord God yeah so Ezekiel was a signed to to Israel and I pray that this Ezekiel will be a sign to this world that Jesus saves Jesus redeems that the power of the blood works you know that that people would see him uh in his life we see the Lord Jesus in his life and you know Ezekiel uh uh in in Chapter 2 of Ezekiel he was told by God to take a scroll and a vision and and and and eat it and it was sweet in his mouth and belly in his U sweet in his mouth and bitter in his belly there there's Ezekiel 2 and3 and we know it's the same with John as a symbol in the Book of Revelation he was a symbol of you and I and he was told in Revelations 10 take the book and eat it it'll be sweet in your mouth and belly in your bitter in your belly and so the words that is Ezekiel were told to speak to Israel was of Woe and lamentation and mourning but the word we have received is of joy and Redemption and salvation and eternal life so I pray that that that he'll become one with this word that and and and then his life will speak it forth under inspiration you his actions everything he does will be God and uh amen so that's my prayer for little Ezekiel so can I hold them you kind of forget how small they are right praise the Lord amen let's B our heads in a word of prayer shall we gracious father as we come to you this morning Lord with a little little Ezekiel Alejandro P dear God we dedicate him into your hands father as brother Jimmy sister Stephanie Lord have Lord come to not Place him in my hands but to place him in your hands Lord Lord CU you are your

their home and Lord wherever they go in church here father may he know your presence and Lord as he comes to an age where he can respond Lord I pray he' just give his life to you and may you live in

amen his name is great amen amen amen let's um turn to the scripture shall we um don't think I have any oh we've got the ministers meeting after lunch before lunch depend how hungry all are but um amen I want to speak this morning on Redemption and complete completeness and in Joy amen amen it's one of the first messages I ever heard W and it's it's a real blessing and um amen so we're just going to go through this a little bit amen so we're going to go to Luke chapter 15 um yeah actually um Christine I think a couple of weeks ago woke up with just those words Redemption and completeness and enjoy I thought I'm going to look into that again you know because you know we should be the happiest people in all the world irrespective of what we're going through the troubles we Face God is God and we are his children amen and we can just praise him no matter what so Amen to Luke Luke 15:1 yeah it's neat this whole we won't read this whole chapter but this whole chapter is about Redemption The Parables of redemption but it doesn't just show the joy of the one who saved it's the joy of the one who's redeemed that one back amen so then Drew near um unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them and and he spake this Parable unto them saying what man of you having a anund sheep if he would lose one of them doth not leave the 9 and9 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when Heath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing Hallelujah and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have lost my sheep which was I mean sorry for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 99 just persons which need no repentance Hallelujah I mean notice just here I mean just as you're turning to First Peter 1:7 you know it's the Shepherd that lays the sheep on his shoulders rejoicing amen the shepher doesn't say oh I finally found you and oh what a mission that was and look how grubby I am and look at the pain I had to go through no he's just happy he's got a sheep back amen it's like the Lord the joy that was sit before him when he went to Calvary was you and I redeemed amen amen he knew what he had to go through but the joy of you redeemed was far greater than what he had to endure amen so praise the Lord now first Peter 1:7 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though ye now you see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory resending uh receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen I trust you're in that condition today Hallelujah joy unspeakable full of glory amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen this morning shall we gracious father as we come into your presence this morning Lord we have Thanksgiving in our hearts because of what you have done and I just pray dear God that may you touch each life Lord Jesus as as as we're assembled here together I I pray Lord that we would see what you have done how you see what you have done Lord God and may we walk out of these doors change renewed transformed Lord may you grant it dear God may you lift burdens Lord may you set the captives free may you fill us with the Holy Ghost may may Faith rise in every heart Lord Jesus may you have your way and may you bless those who couldn't be here today as well be their portion father anyone who may be watching Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we commit the day and the service and ourselves into your hands and ask may your blood cover us all and may you have preeminence For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about this uh redemption in completeness and en joy and it's really an experience that everyone must must uh experience amen so I pray if this comes across this Theory I pray it doesn't come across this Theory because amen I was there when it happened to me amen and you know it's amazing with Redemption how you know just just looking here with you know Redemption is to find that which was lost it's not it's not a replacement you know Redemption is not replacing something you've lost it's getting back that which you lost so just like the shepherd he lost one sheep he didn't just go buy another one he went to get that one that was lost it's the same thing with you and I friends he has come down upon the Earth to find that which was lost so you're in his thoughts in the beginning before the foundation of the world now you're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to World speaking lies you don't know who you are really you think you're from New Zealand or from Africa or wherever you think you're from but really you're from glory and that's why he comes down his word speaks to your heart like it does because he wants to open your eyes to see you came from me going back to me amen so Redemption is not replacement it is restoring that which was lost now there's just something about it when you think about how good our God is you know this joy unspeakable being full of Glory you know we have a joy that the world knows nothing about I wish they did know about it but they don't know about it you know we have a joy that is far Supreme compared to anything else I mean when you think about how he's coming back to receive us back to himself again to take us into Glory it's an incredible thing now this law of redemption we know God works by laws okay and and he has to work according to his laws now the um so so in Exodus is the first time it's not the scripture it's another one we'll get to us the first time the word redeem is ever used in the scripture uh this is in Exodus 6 but I'm just you I'm just saying in the book of Exodus it's used but now now notice this law here it says for the firstling of an ass shall thou redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then Thou shalt break his neck all the firstborn of thy Sons shal thou redeem and None Shall appear before me empty so now we know that um this is not about a natural birth order anymore you know the uh we are all the Church of the firstborn and even even in the scripture how how how the younger received the blessing when Joseph took his two sons before his father and you know you know his father crossed his hands and the blessing that should have gone on the Elder son went upon the youngest son about Ephraim and Manassa and we know that through the cross the blessings that the Jews the firstborn should have received Came Upon Us Gentiles am mean so through the cross we received the blessing of the firstborn you know Esau being the firstborn had right to the birth right but Jacob really wanted it amen so you know so even though he was second born but we know now under the blood of Jesus Christ it's got nothing to do with the order you're born in a family I'm just saying that we are all the firstborn Sons and Daughters of God Amen so there's a law now God says I must redeem my children I cannot leave them unredeemed I must restore them back to their original state I cannot leave them lost in bondage under sin nature I cannot leave them in darkness I must redeem them that just puts the shouting in the in the day shouldn't it amen where God says I have to amen if God says he has to he will amen I'll say he has amen I'm so thankful that we're looking back to Calvary we're not looking forward to Calvary amen cuz there he purchased Us in completeness the Lord praise the Lord so it says here now and None Shall appear before me empty so none not one of his children is going to appear before him empty or in another um translation it says empty-handed amen we're not going to appear before him unrobed or naked as the Bible would say we're going to be robed in his righteousness we're going to be prepared to meet him on that day and you know if there's a joy unspeakable full of Glory in your soul when you think about the goodness of God you know you've know you've met him he's changed your life you can Rejoice saying I'm ready I mean the Lord has made me ready amen so we can we can go shouting and rejoicing the rest of our days amen because we've been redeemed in completeness and in Joy yes sir not a partial Redemption not just a down payment on Redemption no we've been redeemed in completeness and in joy if the devil's fighting you this morning remind them I've been redeemed in completeness and in Joy amen because if there's joy it means you've been redeemed completely amen because there's always a manifestation of what God has done it's not just a head knowledge of that's a nice idea it becomes a reality that's right amen so it becomes a reality now this is such an incredible thing it says even says that the firstborn of a donkey of an ass Thou shalt redeem you know and it doesn't matter you know if you think about it it doesn't matter of the condition of that donkey it may be knocked knee cross side the worst looking little baby donkey you'd ever see but you know and and you know that you know that baby donkey may have a right to be afraid see the brother you know will it be redeemed or not now brother Bram says the trouble the church is scared oh I'm afraid of this don't be afraid you say oh if I can just it isn't you it's him I'm not worthy of healing sure you're not I'm not nobody's not or rather nobody is but he's the one it's not our worthiness it's his goodness to us see Hallelujah in the old Covenant what if a little mule would have been born out of a pasture some night I don't know whether you ever um farmed any or not but this mule was born with flopped ear and a horri horrible mule to begin with he was knocked kned he was crosseyed his tail sticks right straight up what a horrible looking mule now if he could look around to his mamy he'd say you know what as soon as the Master of the House comes out he'll knock me in the head I'm not even worth the eat of the food I eat I am no good now this is this is the condition people get in as as is they think I'm worthless I'm useless I failed I'm no good I've never amount to a hell of beans or anything but we but you but there the problem we look at ourselves see you got to turn your eyes away from you to him I mean because you will disappoint yourself 24/7 we're human right but if you look to him he never disappoints amen he never disappoints amen so keep your eyes upon him but see but now notice now but if his mommy was really instructed she'd say wait a minute son just a minute I'm going to tell you something you don't know that's what I want to tell you you see you don't know who you are son you see you were born under a Birthright amen you were born under a Birthright friends amen and then the master of the house I don't care what you look like when the Master of the House comes out to see he's got a new Mo new mule born then the thing he has to do is get a lamb without a blemish and take that perfect lamb and that perfect lamb dies so you can live I mean then the little little mule can kick up his heels and have a big time hallelujah amen well that's the way it is with us we're imperfect no good born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies we're no good to begin with but God don't look at you look at what God don't look at he don't look at you we look at you ourselves but God don't look at you amen he looks at the sacrifice he looks at the lamb he doesn't see you because he sees Christ Jesus died for you Hallelujah I'm talking about Redemption here he he doesn't look at you he looks at the sacrifice see we've got to get our eyes off ourselves see this is the problem this is the this is the selfie generation amen you can have real time people can I don't know if they do I haven't been looking and I wouldn't advise it but I don't know maybe some people live like The Truman Show they live stream their lives all the time it's all about me me me me me no no it should be all about him him him him him right because we get our eyes on ourselves we'll be disappointed but look to him look at your Redeemer look at the one who has brought you back amen who has restored you back to your original position but you see now you judge yourself by the way you treat God's propitiation Therefore your sin see he you judge yourselves you don't judge him just enough to forgive you see if you think he'll forgive you confess your faults and he'll forgive you see so so so you judge yourself by the way you treat God's propitiation by his by the way you treat his lamb is it enough it's actually more than enough his blood is more than enough am mean it's not just enough it's not just a even no no it's more than enough you know the greater than sign and physics it's always whatever's going to be chewed up oh no whatever is greater is never less than what's less where the sign is right the greater than okay his blood is greater than sin amen his blood is greater than any problem his holy spirit is a greater comforter than any trouble amen he's always greater than Hallelujah so so you're judging Yourself by the way you treat God's propitiation see if this mule did not judge see see if the mule did not believe his mama and did not believe that the lamb was good enough to be a propitiation for his birth amen he wouldn't be kicking up and having a good time see his life that he lived was a manifestation of how he judged himself based on Amen by the way he would treat God's propitiation see so if he judged himself now redeemed because of the Lamb he kicked up and have a big time you follow me today amen so you see it's how you treat God's sacrifice amen we should treat it with the utmost respect and Thanksgiving and reverence amen cuz when I could not go where to to where he was he came to where I was amen amen he came to me here in this world of darkness and praise God I'm so thankful for that now amen we know that we are not redeemed under the blood of bulls and goats but we are we have Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace so now when I talk about the Old Testament bring it to the new remember we're under a far greater Covenant than than the old amen we're not under the blood of a natural lamb amen that cannot change a person take sin nature out of them but we're under the supernatural blood of Jesus Christ Christ amen it doesn't just forgive sins it takes it far away and it takes the sin nature out of the person praise the Lord amen we are the Church of the firstborn I'm just dropping these things in to show you we are to the general assembly this is where we've come to to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are wrot in heaven see God wants you to realize your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life that he put on there before the foundation of the world see this is what Redemption is he's got a book he's got a book of names amen he knows when they'll be born how they'll be born all those different things and then he goes searching hunting out for those names for in a certain season of their lives you may be young you may be old but there's a certain season when he's going to meet you amen and he because he wants to reveal himself to you he wants you to know that you are his you're not the Devils you never were you're his amen child of mine don't you know you belong to me amen that you know should be the question I pray that we should yes Lord I do know amen amen so we can Rejoice the this morning see people see people ask the question do they have the Holy Ghost or not the question really should be not you shouldn't stop there but do you believe it's for you you know I don't know if he died for me well but do you believe it's for you you know because people get stuck in this well do I have it or not no do you believe it's for you if you believe it's for you you can step out in faith and claim it amen because we got to realize that Everything Everything Jesus did was finished that day on Calvary he says he says in the meeting my meeting has never been able uh never been to a place to where I've tried to make the people think that there was something that God had given me a little special towards healing someone that's an error God has given no one any powers to heal someone healing comes by faith alone and faith in a work that's already been done a finished work that Christ did at Calvary it's so much like this if I was starving for food and one loaf of bread would save my life and you passed by in the country somewhere and you seen me starving and you say brother Bram are you hungry I'd say I'll die shortly if I do not have some bread and you reach into your pocket and give me 25 cents and you say brother Brown this is the purchase power of a loaf of bread now I reach out and receive the 25 cents now if you tell me that and I just imagine I've got 25 cents I'm only deceiving myself I've got to hold the 25 cents of my possession the 25 cents is the faith that you have to have faith is a common thing yeah remember it was a weed a common weed that they took and applied the blood on the door in lint and in the first Exodus it was such a common thing you imagine all these weeds that are growing out here take that apply the blood and you will have salvation this is this is a natural this is how common faith is right that's why you think 25 cents it's not a lot of money right it's not a million dollars it's something that actually we I'm sure we all would have 25 cents to get what we need to live naturally now now I believe we have faith of that value which is enough for what we have need of amen amen now sorry I got to find my place again I can just be as happy with that 25 cents as I could be with a loaf of bread in my hand I can Rejoice just as much when you give me the 25 cents as you give me the loaf of bread because I have the purchased power of the loaf of bread and I know there's plenty of bread for sale and when I have faith that God is going to keep his word though I'm not healed at the present time I know that God has plenty of healing power and I've got faith to bring it to me I'm just as happy with the faith that says you're going to be well as you would be if you were sound and well at that minute that makes no difference because you've already possessed it faith is a substance not a make belief if you holding it uh not in your but but you're holding not in your hand but in the possession of your heart you have purchased power of your healing right so if you can look straight into Calvary and see he has redeeming and completeness there and it's revealed to you you're just as happy with the purchasing power of that Faith than having the thing right now amen See Redemption Redemption is a very powerful thing now I'm sorry if this feels like we're just trudging along a bit but we'll get somewhere now he would say he would say in Exodus chapter 6 is the first time this this word is used speaking to Israel uh speaking to Moses bringing uh Israel out of Egypt and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians kept keep in bondage and I have remember remembered my Covenant wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I'll bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I'll rid you out of their bondage and I'll redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments amen so this word Redeemer means to be according to an oriental law it's you it's one of kinship where there's a law in the Bible of the kinsman redeemer where where where someone who is who is a relative who has to so just say if I sold myself into slavery CU I had to because of a debt I couldn't pay one of my relatives had to be a blood relation of course they could come and redeem me out of that slavery they had to be related to me they had to have the purchasing power and they had to have the will to do it amen and that's what our lord Jesus did he you know he changed from from from from great eternal spirit to man he changed his form right so he became kin folks to one of us he came one of us am mean in order to fulfill his law of kinsman redeemer Amen to to to Ransom us out of the grip of sin amen so so this is this is what this redeeming is it's to see see when Israel got into slavery in Egypt God didn't find another people he didn't just start somewhere else no he said the people that have gone down into slavery I'm going to bring them out I'm going to redeem them back I'm going to fulfill my promises I'm going to remember my Covenant see when you begin to cry out to God about trouble and bondage and things the devil's trying to do in your life God remembers his Covenant with you am mean God remembers his word at cause them to come on the scene praise the Lord amen so I will redeem you so I'm going to I'm going to bring you know I'm going to buy you back I'm going to you know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to restore you back to your original estate amen now this is this is where see men are in this earth to be Sons and Daughters of God and when you've wandered out in sin they're out of their original conditions and the Holy Ghost through the blood of Jesus Christ redeems them back in their right position to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen Redemption brought back a man said one time said brother Bram to redeem me says the devil put me in the porn chop and the Lord Jesus redeemed me I thought that was pretty cute and right too that the devil put you in the porn chop but Jesus come and redeemed you amen so so it's like it you know for example I don't go when I go pick up my kids from school you know I don't go buy them out of there but you know I don't just go to school and pick any children you know I could go into a classroom and say Well they're the right age they look about the right height the right color whatever more you know they're girls or they're a boy so I'll just take them no no I go looking for them I go to school with a specific Mission my children are there I'm going to redeem them out of the yok of the teacher amen I'm going to I'm going to set them free Hallelujah the Liberty Bell Rings and they have to come out amen I say the Liberty Bell is ringing amen of the blood of Jesus Christ amen the Lord Has Come not just to find anybody but to find you Amen to find his children amen so when I go to school sometimes I've walked in there and they're still facing the teacher they can't see me but I see them I say you're coming with me amen and then the bow goes and they walk out like the Lord many times he sees you well before you see him right amen like the story that you know you know the eagle egg how the farmer you know he went to an eagle nest he took one of the eggs put it under his chicken chicken in his chicken C you know and that eagle was born and he's you know trying to be like a chicken he's trying to be like what he sees but but you know he's not an ugly duckling but he's an ugly duckling he doesn't fit in something in him just doesn't fit in he tries them with the jocks and the Nerds and the in and the whatever Emos I know what's going on these days and you know he just doesn't fit in in those kind of places and but you but then mama mama really knows because she comes back to the nest and she says there's one egg here this is wrong I had two I want my two amen one's not enough 50% you know God don't God don't do a pass Mark he does 100% I mean he does all amen he has 100% with honors right so then mama you know you know that baby hatches but then on her you know you know in the nest but then in in in Mama's mind she's thinking but I have two and if this one's born that other one will be born somewhere then she starts hunting amen it's the same thing with our Lord how he begins to brood over the Earth looking for you and then that little that little Eagle there in the barnyard you know maybe picked on by the other you know chickens and you know made fun of and all these things and you know beaten down but then one day it's out in the barnyard and and you know it's trying to pick around trying to find something and then all the chicken starts scattering scared to death and then a shadow passes over it of Mama Eagle Hallelujah and then he looks up and then he sees mama mama saw him a long before long time before he ever saw Mama and then Mama looks down and just screams saying come up here my son you don't belong I'm going to redeem you out of the chicken yard I mean but you got to realize that God put a life in you to fly out of the chicken yard I mean because the same life that's in mama was in the baby I mean because why you because look down see the same potentials to fly in the heavenlies like Mama was already in the baby see we don't become Sons and Daughters by the new birth we receive the new birth because we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen so so so M so so he looks up to her and says how do I get up there mama and and she just says stop flopping your wings I maybe you started flopping and you got onto a fence rail you're justified by faith and that felt pretty good but it wasn't up there yet you flopped again you got onto the top of the chicken Co you know all the other chickens all your friends y peer pressure is a demon peer pressure wants to keep you all the same you know and it's really friends who aren't friends just want to get something out of you that's why they want you around they see value in your friendship and that's peer pressure you know it's like the people there in uh wherever it was in the book of Acts how there was that you know there was that girl or that woman there with that with that Spirit of Enchantment you you would you would follow around Paul saying these men show us the way of Salvation you know and she was just used by her by those men that controlled her just to make some money and friends will do the same thing with you see they weren't rejoicing I'm so thankful she's free now I'm so thankful she doesn't tear herself and scream and do bunch of crazy stuff no they're upset because what they got out of her they couldn't get out of her anymore cuz she was free it's the same thing with fake friendships people just are your friend because they want something out of you and that's why people get upset when you come to the Lord because because whatever influence they have upon you to get what they want is broken so now these little chickens are crying out you know come to safety come to safety but that little baby saying no I belong up there I belong up there and then and then and then and then she just says you just flap your wings one more time I'll swoop down and catch you am mean so so so he jumped off that he in faith he jumped off the chicken coop knowing that she would catch her and then she swooped down caught him and fle up into the heavenlies what happened the baby was restored back from where he fell from back from where he was taken from We're taken by sin into this world Amen but God has come to catch us and take us back up again that's right hallelujah amen so amen Lord amen and that's what the Lord you know see Satan put us in the porn shop just as something to be traded but God came to get us out amen I mean we are not a commodity in God's kingdom we're not just something see the devil uses people destroys them sends them to Hell once he's done with them that's what he does he choose them up splits them out that's what this world has done choose people up spits them out I'm sure we can all agree us who came out of it what did it do it chewed us up it spat us out amen but God didn't come to just to chew us up and spit no he came to heal us restore us make us whole show us who we really are amen and once he has lived through us he takes us back he takes us to our reward amen I feel like I'm shouting a bit but I'm not shouting at you I'm just happy okay but you know you see you see he's Tak you know he takes us to our reward down Redemption we know is to buy back that which was lost now Redemption I said is incompleteness yeah and um I think this is Webster says it's completeness means having all necessary Parts elements or steps Glory there what Redemption it's not a partial Redemption you're going to realize if you're under the blood of Jesus Christ this morning you're not sometimes the devils and sometimes Gods doesn't matter what the devil tries to tell you because the devil he puts thoughts and mind Batts and troubles in our minds and he tries to say well you belong to me because you got a mind battle now you got a mind battle because you're still in this body right but he but the devil can't touch your soul amen right he can't touch your soul the Eternal part of you he can't get that Soul he can strike you with sickness it doesn't mean you're not a Believer he can put a mind battle in your spirit doesn't mean you're not a Believer right but he'll try and make you think you're not a Believer because you have those things but you just got to put it back in the devil's face say no my soul's been redeemed by the by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so so this Redemption is not a partial Redemption it's not a shared custody between you and I mean I mean between God and the devil where they've negotiated some term no God says they're mine they have no part in you you have no part in them I'm going to prove it to you Satan they are my children I'm not going to lose one of them they cannot be lost am amen so this Redemption is in completeness just like when um Abraham would would purchase I think it's the first property sale that's recorded there in the Bible where he purchases that field from the children of Heth to bury his wife Sarah and he and he defines the boundaries of that place cuz he doesn't want any dispute on that piece of ground he says this is this is the bearing place for my wife amen so so so that was and then he paid for it in full the price they got um required was the price he paid he didn't say well I'll come back and pay off the interest no he paid it in full before she was ever buried amen it's a same thing when our lord Jesus died on Calvary he purchased a burying place I mean a place of safety that not just when we die we're safe there but when we're alive we come under the blood of Jesus Christ and we're safe amen he has made borders of this place that the devil has no claim on you when you're under the blood amen praise God hallelujah amen so you know it's so so it's it's it's it has all the parts praise the Lord as you know this is one of my favorite scriptures in Colossians and you being dead in your sins and and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all I like that word all trespasses amen having forgiven you all let's say that all all trespasses I mean blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it amen so when Jesus went down to hell he took the keys of Hell death and the grave of Satan amen he see under the blood of balls and goats that was a mighty uh redemption in Shadow but the reality is far greater amen amen when we realize that truly he has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen amen so he's taken them away from us as far as the east as from the West amen he's taken them and put them in the sea of his forgetfulness that is so deep the Bible says even the adders can't get down there am me so the bottom of that sea is so deep the devil can't get in amen he can't those sins are gone and it even gets better than that because you know someone's going to have to answer for that sin and it ain't you amen if it's confessed under the blood of Jesus Jesus that's what I'm saying Redemption and completeness and en Joy see we don't go from this life praising God knowing we're redeemed to the next World wondering if we're going to make it or not see this Redemption goes through every Dimension amen it goes from here to Glory right Hallelujah it still stands on the other side as well see it's not just well am I going to make it no if you've been redeemed in completeness and in joy you can stand and say praise God Lorden if I my if this is my last breath my next breath is is going to take me to the presence of the one I love and I'm going to stand undefiled redeemed washed in his blood I don't have to fear going through that portal of death amen that's right praise the Lord the Lord now brother Ram says it says now when man before he sinned I'm closing but don't you miss this I'm not closing I'm halfway but don't you miss this when man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed the great Chasm and put himself and Death on this side he left there's no way back exactly there's no way for him to get back but when he did he accepted a God sorry accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or something for blood which Adam spoke of or Abel spoke of on the other side of the chasm on that side he's a Son of God he's an offspring of God he is an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a Creator himself he's an offspring of God but when he crossed he separated his sunship so he left the sunship position he's a sinner by Nature he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan and God took a sacrifice as a chemical of the blood but the blood of balls and goats did not divorce sin it only covered sin if you've got a red spot on your hand and cover it with white the red spot's still there see it's still there but God went down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son that when out confess and drops into God's bleach try to find it again am That's The Power of confession from a sincere heart try to find it again you won't be able to find it the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through time until it hits the accused of Satan and lays on him to the till the day of the Judgment I that's why I said someone's going to pay for it someone's got to answer for the sin and it's not you now all the sins that the devil made you do when you're unconverted they go upon the head of the enemy and he's got to answer for those things and not just the past ones but the present and the future ones hallelujah amen now now if our sins lays upon the accuser till the day of the Judgment then what happens to you and I what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him no more there is no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he is free Hallelujah just as that clorax or that ink can never be ink no more because it's broke up and sent back again and when confessed sin is confessed and being dipped into a man or woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil laid on him to the day of judgment where he is he where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire and the chasm is bridged and never to come in remembrance no more a man stand stands justifies the Son of God he says Simplicity Hallelujah that's your condition if you're under the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen that's so isn't that wonderful you see when the Lord Jesus bowed his head that down Calvary and said it is finished he said exactly what he meant I've paid it in full just like Abraham buying the bearing place for Sarah it's been fully purchased I've ransomed my children I've bought them back I've atoned for their sin amen it is finished now I pray we could just look at Calvary the way he looks at it amen because through the Lord's eyes it is finished it was done that day and I Pray by faith we could look at Calvary the same way and see it is finished amen the sin question's been settled amen the argument's over amen the discussion's done my Lord Jesus has redeemed me in completeness amen amen and en Joy amen hallelujah now the wonderful thing about this Redemption is that is that what it purchases you can live on it for the rest of your days amen just like the just like the widow woman went to Elisha and she had two sons that were going to be sold as slaves because they were under a debt they couldn't pay just like we were under a debt we couldn't pay and then and then so she knew she didn't have the money to cover her dead husband's debt she knew it was done in the morning her sons are going to be taken and be become slaves but then she went to the prophet said what shall I do and then so now the woman you know was instructed by the prophet go borrow all the vessels you can find from the neighbors put them into your house close all the windows and doors and that little that little jar of oil you have that one you have which you think is insignificant take it and fill every one of them now I've never I've never taken a vessel and poured it into another and just say just say the other jars would have been a lot bigger and you she took that jar how big it was and you pour it and it doesn't get lighter as you pour and then what's in here was Far bigger than what should be in here right but this was now Redemption because redemption in action because she was going to because the prophet instructed her to do this that now her sons going to be redeemed they were going to be redeemed from that debt so they took all the jars filled them all up amen and then when the last one was um full the oil stopped flowing Hallelujah and then she went to the went to the prophet no doubt rejoicing could could you imagine the feeling is this going to work well he told me it's going to work you know so I believe it's going to work but then when Faith becomes sight I mean when when the first jar is full and the second jar is full and the third jar is full and maybe your arm was getting a bit sore so now swaps over and then every Jar full full full full but yet she's holding this little you know our faith is far greater than we know she had to to do that in faith amen she had to take the word of the prophet in faith and apply it amen so that's what she did and then she went to the man of God and said and he said go sell the oil pay your debts and you and your sons can live on the rest see so now this Redemption see this Redemption what it purches it gives us the ability to live off it what do we live off joy peace love Comfort when the Devil comes and with troubled well in this Redemption is comfort you don't know which way to turn well in this Redemption is guidance he's our Shepherd amen sickness comes in well in this Redemption is healing Amen in this Redemption is salvation for our families it's all we can live off these things amen all of our days amen that because the beautiful thing about Redemption is once we have re been redeemed we don't go back to what caused us to go into into slavery again because the thing is with this Redemption it's not just a forgiveness of a debt you know because it's like a man I think I heard brother Tim PR say this I thought it was a very good analogy where he said it's like a man see just say if I was in a big mess of financial debt and then a and then a wise businessman came along and said I can pay your debt off and I'd be very happy about that I'd be I'd be rejoicing because my debts you know but yet Within Me is still a nature that I can fall into debt again but then now what if the spirit of that wise businessman didn't so so he didn't just pay off my debt but it now came into me that now my thinking everything changed that I could not fall into that dead again because I've be made a different person right and that's exactly what happens when the Holy Ghost comes into US amen we're no longer that deta that's just being forgiven no the wise master builder the Lord Jesus Christ now steps in that we can't fall back into sin debt anymore praise the Lord so it's not just it's not just forgiven amen we are changed amen but this oil that we've been given this Redemption we've been given we can live off it now don't use it sparing Hallelujah don't use the promises of God sparingly amen it's an inexhaustible Fountain amen this is not a diet amen no this is a this is a gastronomical jubilee of goodness amen you say well I better just read the Bible sparingly because I'm going to run out no this word's Eternal am mean you can read the same scripture for every day for the rest of your life and something else will become greater in it am me because that word is eternal amen it never runs out amen it's like the hidden manner amen that was that was that was under the mercy SE in the Ark of the Covenant that manner never went stale it never got Roden amen it's the same thing when the Holy Ghost comes into your soul the word comes into your soul it never gets old it never becomes common I mean when you're redeemed in completeness and in Joy it never becomes common that you were once lost now you're found amen you never take it for granted that you're a son of or daughter of the king amen it is it never spoils amen it never gets boring it never becomes common it's Finger Licking Good Honey in the Rock that's what it is amen it's satisfying to any thirsty Soul Hallelujah now when Jesus said it's finished it's because all of Jesus's Works was complete everything was complete total delivered he totally delivered the leper from leprosy he totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church there's no need for us to live under privileged people there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians who's a Christian today amen filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have to have the devil dictate to us Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from the from Habits delivering us from Talking delivered us from the um um from black God Deliver Us from all kinds of smudy things he totally delivered us and puts us in his holy hands a complete total Deliverance he delivered our sickness he delivered us from sickness for we have an abstract deed to that Hallelujah for he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed he is our healer that's why that poor little poo woman trying to take care of a cancer dying husband she walked into the Realms of the prince of God she had faith and the doctors had done all they could do so she followed God's instructions and was totally delivered amen so this so so this is a total Deliverance so we're redeemed in completeness now I'm getting to the Joy bit amen amen to the definition of Joy it's a gladness it's the joy received from you it's the cause or occasion of Joy amen it's a person who are one's Joy amen so there's a great cause or occasion of Joy what is that we are redeemed in completeness amen we have a great occasion to be joyful that's right I mean as that as that scripture in 1 Peter 18 the uh ESV version it says though you you have not seen him you love him though you do not see um though you do not now see him you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inex expressable and filled with Glory why because it's such a great joy I mean you can't really put words to describe the reality of being redeemed or being washed in the blood or being transformed by the Holy Ghost you can't quite put it into words but you try I mean you try and put it into words amen but you just can't quite get it there amen of Lord why because it's such a because it's not a mental thing that you can teach only but it's got to be a reality that comes into our lives like you see like the you know the children of Israel they under the blood of bulls and goats they left Egypt you know but then there was the cry you know they heard the chariot wheels and things behind them and all the fear of all their task Masters and the and the trauma and the pain that they they experienced in Egypt as slav started to flood back into their minds and they began to panic there by the Red Sea and they said to Moses did you not bring us you just brought us out here to die wouldn't there b graves in Egypt why have you brought us this way but God had delivered them by Blood and by power now he is going to completely show his power of redemption amen and give them such a Redemption of completeness and en Joy because he wanted to them to completely know they had been redeemed he wanted to completely show them that they were redeemed that they didn't just Escape Egypt and they could have been overcome by what they brought out of God wanted to show them that that that their task Masters those that beat them as slaves and killed their children and did horrible things to them we're going to be no more that's why Moses before the sea ever opened God spoke through him and said these Egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever there's going to be a change in your life from this moment on this enemy that's been def defeating you and tearing you down is going to be drowned Amen in the Red Sea amen so then Moses lifted up his staff and he parted the waters and then Israel walked on on dry land and then they came when they all safely across the sea the Egyptians thought that they could cross as well but then they got drowned in the Red Sea what a feeling it must have been I mean when they saw their task Masters drowned those ones that beat them maybe they saw the exact ones that were beating them was now face down in the Red Sea what a feeling that would have been to realize Jehovah God has redeemed Us in completeness amen from Egypt complete Redemption amen what a what a feeling that would have been for those Jews when they look back and they saw the ones that whipped them and made fun of them and thrw Stones them spit on their faces did terrible things were now dead and could torment them no more amen that's Hallelujah no wonder Miriam who was an 80 80 oddy old woman I mean picked up a tambourine she got anointed by what she saw I mean she got anointed by the fact that she had been redeemed and completeness and she started to dance amen and bang the tambourine on the Shore Bank amen and then all the other women of Israel begin to dance and rejoice with it God in the spirit of the meeting I mean brother MCS talk about a Pentecostal meeting am mean when they look now Hallelujah see our religion we have is old it's not new this is an old religion this is an oldtime religion actually started before the foundation of the world and job was asked by God where were you when the sons of God praised amen hallelujah why so so what a what an atmosphere that would have been in because they looked at the Red Sea and they saw their enemies were drowned I mean no wonder Moses got in the spirit begin to sing the songs of Moses am amen praise God for all that he had done yes sir amen now listen friends that was just a physical enemy was drowned in a physical sea I mean now how much more see they were just they were delivered from a physical bondage they redeemed from a physical enemy that was a great day but tell you friends thousands of years after that amen when our Lord Jesus Christ bowed his head and died amen and he redeemed Adam's Fallen race amen not just from a not from a physical oppression but a spiritual oppression from a sin nature that they were born with that they could not free themselves from amen what a day that is when you can look into the blood of Jesus Christ and you can see your enemies dead amen you can see that family Spirit dead you can see that tormenting Spirit dead amen what a joy that that gives us amen we can see our enemy is dead amen sometimes we need to go back and look in that red sea of the blood of Jesus Christ and realize what he has taken from us Glory hallelujah amen it was a complete see it's a complete Redemption and complete and in Joy amen God's joy is not based on a true Joy is not based on circumstances right amen when when Paul would would meet the Lord on the road to Damascus and God transformed his life he realized that he was truly redeemed sin nature didn't rule him religion didn't rule him his culture didn't rule him I mean he wasn't under the slavery of those things no more but he was a l prisoner to Jesus christall amen that's why he could look at that chopping block and say death R is your thing grave where is your Victory amen hallelujah hallelujah see the joy that Israel experienced was nothing compared to the 120 on the day of Pentecost I mean where God had gather them to show the full power of his blood amen that was far greater than the blood of bulls and goats that just covered sin and took sin uh but but it took sin and sin nature out of the people I mean that's why you know when we can we can look at Calvary and see what Our Redeemer has done for for us Amen in its completeness how can you not have joy how can it not make you happy Hallelujah the Lord praise the Lord amen that's why they staggered like drunk people there after the Holy Ghost filled them they were jabbering and speaking in other languages staggering around like drunk people amen they were they were carrying on that seemed very indifi but what had happened they realized they had been redeemed and completeness and en Joy amen The Joy was springing up because they realized that the blood that they saw come out of their Lord's body amen the life that was in the blood now came in them amen and they were now completely sealed to the day of their Redemption see this is why it's such a complete a complete Redemption why because when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost you're sealed into the day of your Redemption the devil can't burn it out of you he can't he can't argue it out of you he can't take the holy ghost out of you you are safe as safe can be sure you go through trouble you go through hardship but the devil can't take those things out of you and I that's right am mean he cannot take the baptism of the Holy Ghost from you and I amen it quickened their bodies it quickened their souls they scream they dance amen even even even Mary you know jesus' mother there you know she she had to climb up there into the upper room receive the Holy Ghost and act like a b just like a drunk woman Amen to get into heaven Hallelujah but why why did they do that because the stimulation was so great The Joy was so great it was more than just a human Joy amen but it was God's Own Joy cuz remember we started off with the script where the where the shepherd is rejoicing you keep reading and there's a woman that loses one of her coins she rejoices when she finds the coin amen there's the story of the prodical son amen this the father rejoices when the son comes home amen so it's not just our joy that we're redeemed but God has a joy amen amen I'm going to finish with this thought amen it says now if you abide in me and my words abide in you you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as the father has loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things I have spoken unto you that my joy might REM might remain in you and that your joy might be full see there's a moment we can go back where we know the Lord got a hold of our lives and it gave us great joy and and we think how can we stay in that kind of a joy wouldn't it be nice to stay in that all the time well you can amen because because the Lord wants his joy to remain in you amen amen that your joy might be full so he wants our joy to be full he wants us to be happy Christians amen he doesn't want us to be sad sad and downcast and down he wants us to be happy amen and he wants us to be happy in every situation even though it's hard there may be great trouble going on but he still wants us to have joy Joy now this is the great secret he says this is my commandment that you love one another as I loved you so if you want his joy to remain in you love one another as he has loved you amen amen don't hold any grudges bitterness resentment ill feelings just get those things out of the way and because you'll find as soon as those things come in Joy goes out you can't you know because when there's joy there when you're when you're Punch Drunk on the Holy Ghost you seen someone who real happy drunk who's seen a happy drunk before more everything's fine they can have no money in the bank they can have all kind of trouble but they're happy why cuz they're drunk just and now this is just a natural drunk now you take a a a a holy ghost drunk who's ever been drunk on the spirit everything's good everything's fine Hallelujah nothing matters the goodness of God just overflows you and you're just happy amen what's happened why because the joy of the Lord now comes into your life amen hallelujah so we got to stay in the love of God don't let any ought come in if you can't Overlook someone's mistake I say you got to come back to a love where you can Overlook those things where actually everything is okay amen there's no bad feelings no trouble no I mean there'll be trouble sure because we're human but there should be no ill feelings you know we should never ever hold something against someone we should always give people the benefit of the doubt amen if we want the love of God God's love I mean Joy well his his love is but his his joy to remain in US amen CU he wants our joy to be full so we can't we must love see see he loved us with a redeeming love remember the Bible says when we were his enemy he died for us we were we weren't his neutal we were neutral we were his enemy once upon a time but yet he loved us anyway amen amen when we were lost in darkness he came looking for you and I so should should we not have that s same kind of sacrificial love who wants a full Joy remember because if you are redeemed in completeness you will have joy there'll be a manifestation if you're not happy in your religion you say Lord created me a Clean Heart Lord renew a right Spirit Within Me David said restore unto me the joy of my salvation am mean so he didn't lose his salvation but he lost the joy of it that's what the devil wants us to do he wants to Rob our joy of being saved amen the joy of our Redemption the devil wants to take that from us amen but you see we can stay in that Joy amen this is not a thing where we just enjoy God for a little bit we fizzle out we just occupy a Pew no This Joy should be greater amen amen the more we walk with God the greater reality of what he brought us out of should become apparent I mean the greater power the full power of the blood should become more apparent what he's done for us you think about it if we all left right now and we're in heaven I think we'll really realiz what he's done the things he's kept us from the things he saved us from the things he's delivered us from the things that we walked in both eyes open he took us out of Amen his love that's kept us he's guided us Comfort Us in great times of trouble if we could really see you know like that sheep that's just lost we read about the opening scripture just wandered off the path looking for some grass somewhere not knowing where it's going it doesn't know but now the shepherd's going to climb up Mountains go through valleys maybe Wade through water you know maybe get injured hurt hung hungry you know the Sheep doesn't know what the shepherd had had to go through to get it right it's just like really we can read about Jesus being mared more than any man you know his bone you know you know bones out of joint and all those things but we don't know what he had to go through and because we just look at the physical things what about carrying the sin of the world upon their shoulders we all you know I'm sure we all knew that day when we really felt that burden of sin on our shoulders and we all know that day when we laid it at the cross and it was gone right so we don't know really what the Sheep's really gone through and its full magnitude but you see when he found the Sheep he just laid on his shoulders and rejoiced amen he didn't say you stupid sheep you shouldn't have done this no he's happy amen that sheep that's mine has come back and he wants that same joy to be transferred into US amen that that that how that that how he looks at Redemption we would look at it the same way amen so friends love one another if you want your joy to be full love one another be quick to forgive be have a very short account have no ought love everybody amen that his Joy will might remain in you and your joy might be full amen amen so let's have the musicians uh this morning but Redemption and completeness and en Joy I pray that you know you're redeemed I pray you know the completeness of it it's not a partial Redemption it's not a down payment it's not a you know but no the blood of God has fully redeemed us back to him amen amen that the devil has no part in you and I even though he wants to think he does he has no part he doesn't belong he's not welcome amen I pray that You' be able to look into the blood of Jesus Christ and see what see what your enemies have been drown that day when you gave your life to the Lord and you can rejoice and keep walking on Amen let's um stand shall we amen they's stand and sing amen um uh let's do we have
