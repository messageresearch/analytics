[21:30] in Jesus wonderful name amen amen praise
[21:34] the Lord thank you musicians thank you
[21:37] brother
[21:38] Josh it was nice I was hoping for a nice
[21:41] uh song service to create a nice
[21:42] atmosphere
[21:44] because I've had a bit
[21:46] of I woke up this morning a we bit
[21:51] tired and it's not the greatest thing to
[21:54] wake up tired because our natural man
[21:59] uh maybe isn't as longsuffering as we
[22:02] would like him or her to be was that
[22:05] just
[22:09] me so it feels like I've been yelling at
[22:11] people all day but I don't think I have
[22:12] it just feels like I have maybe I yelled
[22:14] in my mind but my better sense enabled
[22:18] me to not
[22:19] yell and yet in my mind maybe I think I
[22:23] was but you know they when we get in the
[22:28] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that
[22:28] changes everything you know and and
[22:31] that's what we want to do is to live in
[22:32] the atmosphere atmosphere of the Holy
[22:34] Ghost I won't keep you standing long
[22:35] let's um let's turn in our Bibles to
[22:38] Ephesians
[22:45] 3:8 it says unto me who am less than the
[22:49] least of All Saints is this Grace
[22:53] given that I should preach among the
[22:55] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[22:57] Christ and to make all men see what is
[22:59] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[23:02] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[23:03] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[23:05] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[23:08] principalities and
[23:10] powers and Heavenly places might be
[23:12] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[23:14] of
[23:14] God according to the Eternal purpose
[23:17] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[23:19] lord in whom we have boldness and access
[23:23] with confidence by the faith of him amen
[23:27] amen may God bless is where you can take
[23:28] your seats um this evening
[23:31] amen the thought that I want to speak on
[23:36] this evening is a thought called
[23:40] unworthy um yet
[23:44] worthy amen so how you feeling you're
[23:46] feeling
[23:47] good very
[23:49] good I was moving so fast today I forgot
[23:51] to eat
[23:54] food so I got home and there was my
[23:57] emergency supply of food and it's these
[24:01] um smoothie drinks for
[24:05] diabetics I think they've gone all
[24:07] through the church and nobody wants them
[24:08] but I
[24:09] still I'm still a willing
[24:12] participant and these drinks come
[24:14] courtesy of brother Phil CU he has his
[24:16] operation so he's got to live on these
[24:17] smoothies I don't think even he doesn't
[24:19] like
[24:20] them but you read on the packet it says
[24:23] on the bottle it's got 27 essential
[24:26] minerals and vitamins
[24:28] and it's a complete food in itself I
[24:30] thought that'll
[24:33] do I had two of them for dinner complete
[24:39] food I'm going to mention to brother
[24:41] Phil you know if he
[24:43] um when I when my Supply runs a bit low
[24:45] maybe you could quickly just have
[24:46] another operation and get a whole bunch
[24:50] more I don't know if you'd be so
[24:53] obliging
[24:54] um but you know the word of God I'm I'm
[24:57] glad that the word of God is a complete
[24:59] food in itself you know that's actually
[25:02] all that we need for our soul is the
[25:04] word of God the the Lord said man shall
[25:06] not live by bread alone but by every
[25:08] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[25:10] God Amen and this thought that I have I
[25:15] pray that I could deliver it in the
[25:18] inspiration that I received it in you
[25:21] know it's often a hard thing for
[25:23] ministers when you're in your you you
[25:26] may not always be in your quiet place
[25:28] you may be driving you may be somewhere
[25:29] then you just get this bit of
[25:30] inspiration and something moves your
[25:32] heart you know and it often times it can
[25:34] move you to tears or move you to Rejoice
[25:35] or whatever the inspiration whatever the
[25:38] emotion of the inspiration might be you
[25:40] know you sort of you catch something and
[25:42] then then you feel like you at some
[25:46] point in time you have to deliver that
[25:47] and you try to you hope that you know
[25:50] when I go to delivering this that I can
[25:52] capture that same emotion that same
[25:53] feeling that that I had when I received
[25:55] it you know because I I mean it would
[25:57] just be words if it all the word of God
[25:59] is true but you know we want that we
[26:00] want the spirit that was delivered in
[26:02] and and I've I've enjoyed um this this
[26:06] thought behind this one
[26:09] and you know this idea of unworthy you
[26:13] often times in my life I felt unworthy
[26:15] has anyone ever had that sort of
[26:20] feeling you know we look at ourselves
[26:22] and
[26:23] we often times when we end up at the
[26:26] feet of the Cross or
[26:28] calling out to the Lord is because often
[26:31] times we've usually come to the end of
[26:33] ourselves you know and we we've tried a
[26:35] lot of things we think we're good we
[26:36] think we can do this and we can do that
[26:38] and then eventually we find out that we
[26:40] can't and we realize that Lord I just
[26:43] need some help and we we come to the
[26:44] Lord just asking for help so we turn up
[26:47] very unworthy you know we've maybe tried
[26:49] everything else and we we turn up
[26:51] unworthy and we've got nothing really
[26:52] that we can bring to the table yeah now
[26:55] it's like if there was some sort of uh a
[26:58] business deal maybe that we wanted some
[27:01] to to purchase some sort of business and
[27:03] we it will be like us going to the
[27:05] business owner but turning up at the
[27:07] table with no money no we haven't tried
[27:09] that business before no nothing they
[27:10] saying look we want the whole business
[27:12] though we just we just want it you know
[27:13] we're sort of unworthy to even get it we
[27:15] don't have anything that would Merit
[27:16] that we should receive it or anything
[27:18] but and yet that's the way we turn up
[27:20] with the Lord is we turn up unworthy RAR
[27:23] you know and if we haven't turned up
[27:25] that way maybe we haven't turned up the
[27:27] right way yet yeah you know so so in
[27:29] ourselves in our natural our natural man
[27:33] or
[27:34] woman we we have this feeling that we're
[27:36] unworthy and then and then God being
[27:38] such a good God just does things for us
[27:40] sometimes you know and maybe we haven't
[27:42] been the greatest and yet some good
[27:43] things just happen to us and we think
[27:44] Lord I'm So Unworthy of this you know
[27:46] what why do I do these things and yet
[27:49] you just pour your goodness out upon me
[27:51] you know I think of that story I forget
[27:52] the man's name but he was a used to do a
[27:54] bit of hunting and that the the um
[27:56] colored brother and I think I think he
[27:57] shot a whole bunch of animals one day
[27:59] and he thought to himself he thought
[28:01] Lord you must love me look I just I'm
[28:02] not even really serving you not doing
[28:04] anything you just give me all this game
[28:06] I believe I serve you you know he
[28:08] realized Lord I'm just unworthy but you
[28:10] just do these good things for me that
[28:12] that that love overwhelmed
[28:15] him but yet you know part of our
[28:19] Christian walk or part of being a
[28:20] Christian is realizing but you are
[28:22] worthy that you do actually have value
[28:26] like you can't live your whole Christian
[28:27] walk thinking I'm unworthy I've got no
[28:29] value because if if you if you actually
[28:32] didn't have any value then the Lord
[28:33] wouldn't come and die for you that's
[28:35] right therefore there was a a perfect
[28:37] life came to die for you if you were the
[28:40] only one on Earth that would he would
[28:42] die for you amen therefore that places
[28:45] some sort of value upon you you have
[28:48] value you're not just a nobody that is
[28:49] worth nothing you you must be worth a
[28:52] lot if the god of Heaven would be
[28:54] willing to pay the ultimate price which
[28:56] was his life to to purchase you you must
[28:59] be worth a lot you know we thank you
[29:01] Lord more so than that we're not just uh
[29:05] we realized Lord we can't just go about
[29:08] thinking well I'm just I'm Just a Nobody
[29:09] just a sinner saved by grace well that's
[29:11] correct but then there's another part of
[29:13] us it has to realize we maybe I'm more
[29:15] than that may maybe I'm a maybe I'm a
[29:18] Son of God maybe I'm part of this whole
[29:20] inheritance maybe maybe I'm part of this
[29:22] whole family that's right even more than
[29:24] that I'm not just a A handmaid or this
[29:26] I'm actually a bride of this almighty
[29:29] God I'm actually I'm a part of this I I
[29:32] have an inheritance this thing belongs
[29:33] to me it's it's it's far different than
[29:36] turning up thinking we're unworthy and I
[29:37] deserve nothing to actually realizing at
[29:39] some point but I am worthy yes sir and
[29:43] and I want to speak tonight about these
[29:45] two sort of places that we go in our
[29:47] mind to on one hand we're unworthy which
[29:50] is true you know and it's if you want to
[29:52] get anywhere with God you got to realize
[29:53] you're unworthy you know that's that's
[29:56] the way when you come humble and and and
[29:58] realize you're nothing before the Lord
[29:59] then he can use you but you know on the
[30:01] other hand we realize that but but I am
[30:03] worthy otherwise the devil will keep
[30:05] tripping you're up the whole way along
[30:06] and you you won't claim all the promises
[30:08] of God for your life
[30:10] okay so I'm going to speak in a type
[30:14] tonight so I'm going to take us through
[30:16] a a story and it's going to be a I'm
[30:17] going to preach in the type so I'm going
[30:18] to have a story and the story that I um
[30:22] the story that I want to speak in a type
[30:23] of is the story of um Ruth and Naomi
[30:29] which is an unusual um story for me
[30:32] because I usually pick a
[30:34] king but it's good it's good this one we
[30:37] want to talk about this is a story about
[30:40] Ruth I'm just going to give you a bit of
[30:42] background but you all know the story
[30:44] but and then when we get to a certain
[30:45] point then I'll put the types in okay
[30:47] and I believe you'll be
[30:49] blessed so here in this picture we have
[30:52] um
[30:54] imik and Naomi
[30:58] and her two
[30:59] sons now there was a famine in the land
[31:01] of Israel and the economy wasn't doing
[31:04] so good so they left that land and went
[31:06] across to a place called Moab which was
[31:09] if you can see in this picture here Moab
[31:11] wasn't too far away but they had to
[31:13] journey across outside of Israel into
[31:15] Moab to um work and do things there that
[31:19] hoping that it would be a better life
[31:21] for them
[31:24] there now while they were there the two
[31:27] Sons met
[31:29] two uh women of
[31:32] Moab one by the name of Ruth and one by
[31:35] the name of
[31:36] Ora and they married these one brother
[31:40] married one of these women and another
[31:41] brother married the other and life for
[31:45] them was going along quite
[31:49] well then it says here and they took
[31:51] them wives of the woman of Moab the name
[31:53] of the one was Opa and the name of the
[31:55] other Ruth and they dwelt about 10
[31:59] years and Maron and chilon died also
[32:03] both of them and the woman was left with
[32:06] her left of her two sons and her husband
[32:08] so before that the husband passed away
[32:12] and then her two sons passed away so
[32:15] Naomi was left with these two daughters
[32:18] of um
[32:21] Moab so she's in a Strange Land with
[32:23] these two daughters of Moab okay now
[32:25] this is where we're gonna put our
[32:27] spiritual thinking caps on and go into
[32:29] our spiritual type okay because we're
[32:32] going to run it all the way through and
[32:34] it's about being unworthy yet worthy
[32:36] okay so Ruth in this story is going to
[32:40] be typed as our Earthly uh body and as
[32:45] far as I can see we all have one of
[32:47] those and it generally is the thing that
[32:49] gives us all the problems you know as
[32:52] Paul said oh Wicked Richard man who that
[32:55] I am who shall deliver me from this body
[32:56] of death
[32:58] when when he'd been tormented by it so
[33:00] long but that's this Earthly body that
[33:01] we find ourselves in that's the five
[33:03] senses that's the a mind that works and
[33:05] everything that's our this is our
[33:06] Earthly
[33:08] body the second type I want to use in
[33:11] the story is Naomi and I want to type
[33:13] Naomi as Ruth's Celestial body or her
[33:17] theophany which is which is the same
[33:19] thing because you know we have a we have
[33:23] a Celestial body already waiting for us
[33:26] so we have our Earthly body here but we
[33:27] have our our Celestial body that is
[33:29] waiting for us when this one finishes we
[33:31] have a Celestial body and then the final
[33:33] body we have is our glorified body which
[33:34] is everything which is this flesh
[33:36] redeemed and that it's all together as
[33:38] our our our glorified body right but but
[33:43] we have our Celestial body or our
[33:44] theophany we all have one if we have
[33:48] representation right if this body be
[33:50] dissolved we have another one already
[33:51] waiting we meaning the bride okay now
[33:54] this may seem strange but the husbands
[33:56] that died I want to I I want to type
[33:59] them as the word for the hour any hour
[34:02] not that the word for the hour dies but
[34:04] it's a you know things take place and
[34:06] then we have to really find out who is
[34:08] this word what's behind this word then
[34:10] you know we have to we want to find out
[34:11] more than just the we want to hear more
[34:14] than just a man speaking we want to find
[34:15] out what's the voice behind the voice so
[34:18] it's in that sense that it died not
[34:19] saying the word died okay the other one
[34:21] I didn't put in here but I think it's
[34:23] applicable is emik can actually be typed
[34:26] as God
[34:27] okay okay because emik went away as well
[34:31] you you think well that's strange but I
[34:32] thought about it I thought yeah that
[34:33] kind of works all the way through
[34:34] because at the end when Boaz redeemed
[34:36] him he said I'm claiming all that was
[34:38] emik and all that was Naomi I'm claiming
[34:40] the whole thing he said all that the
[34:42] father has given me will come I'm going
[34:43] to claim the whole thing all poers given
[34:44] to me so he actually he actually
[34:46] redeemed everything that that belongs to
[34:48] em emik all right okay all
[34:53] right and I'm going to type or
[34:58] as the church natural with no Celestial
[35:01] body okay because Ora just heard that
[35:04] word and then when when when hardship
[35:07] arose when something happened when when
[35:08] maybe there was a fuss in the church or
[35:10] something she she she turned away she
[35:13] didn't because she didn't actually have
[35:14] any representation of what was behind
[35:16] that word who it was what was there okay
[35:20] so now if we go on this with this in
[35:23] mind then then the scene is set where we
[35:26] have
[35:27] we have Ruth and Naomi uh Ruth Naomi and
[35:31] Ora now Ruth is not from Moab H sorry
[35:34] Naomi is not from Moab she is from
[35:36] another land yeah she's from the
[35:38] promised land okay and Ruth is from Moab
[35:43] she's a she's from not the promised land
[35:46] she's not part of that inheritance not
[35:47] part of that Kingdom and so is
[35:50] Opa now you you following me so far okay
[35:54] you you this is very simple this is not
[35:57] don't let Satan tell you that the word
[35:58] of God is hard and types are hard and
[36:00] that they're not they're very the word
[36:01] of God is very simple okay it's very
[36:03] it's very it's just when when the Lord
[36:06] when Jesus preached he just preached
[36:07] about the sewer sa went forth to se
[36:09] seeds he kept it nice and simple okay so
[36:14] now these Ora and Ruth had both heard
[36:18] the word of God okay via uh Naomi from
[36:24] this and Via am from this other land
[36:26] they'd heard word and they they were
[36:27] rejoicing in it they they' received it
[36:29] they were happy but then at some point
[36:31] something happened and and maybe they
[36:33] had to go through a bit of hardship
[36:34] maybe things happen and that and they
[36:37] and so the challenge was laid out Naomi
[36:40] said look it's not working for me I'm
[36:42] going to head back to my land where I
[36:43] come from you two stay here I'm going to
[36:46] go
[36:47] back now Ora took her up on that
[36:50] proposition because Ora maybe couldn't
[36:52] she didn't like all the having to wear
[36:54] these dresses and do these things and
[36:55] all this sort of stuff and all these
[36:56] rules regulations when she thought about
[36:58] it she thought I'm not really too keen
[37:00] on this
[37:01] really
[37:03] she when she waited up she thought yeah
[37:05] well moab's not so bad you know this
[37:07] land that they've talked about I've
[37:08] never been there never really seen
[37:10] it hey I I'll take my chances and just
[37:14] stick around here I know family here
[37:15] it's it's this is more comfortable for
[37:17] me but you see the reason why she did
[37:20] that is because she didn't have a
[37:21] theophany she didn't have a
[37:22] representation from the other land
[37:24] that's right she had no representation
[37:25] so that her that meant nothing that this
[37:28] word of God although she heard it maybe
[37:29] rejoiced in it for a season it didn't
[37:30] really mean anything to her when it came
[37:32] to actually digging a bit deeper and and
[37:35] getting to the land where it came from
[37:37] because remember that word came from the
[37:38] promised land okay it came from there
[37:41] when it came to that nothing in her
[37:43] seemed to want it and yet Ruth when this
[37:46] happened when Naomi said I'm going to go
[37:49] back to my land you stay here because
[37:51] she had representation from there she
[37:54] said I don't understand this but there's
[37:56] something in me that's going to head
[37:58] back that way even though it's all seems
[38:00] to have gone wrong and I've suffered all
[38:01] this
[38:02] hardship there's something in that land
[38:04] that I want Hallelujah that that I'm
[38:07] that that's just a part of me somehow I
[38:09] don't know what it is I don't know why
[38:10] but Hallelujah there's something there
[38:12] for me come on she had representation
[38:15] there was something calling her now she
[38:16] didn't know what it was she'd never been
[38:18] there didn't see any photos didn't know
[38:23] anyone else here apart from the three
[38:24] that the her husband that had passed
[38:26] away
[38:28] and yet she she just wanted it so
[38:30] strongly that Ruth said she said to
[38:34] Naomi and this is a this is a verse that
[38:37] I think all of us Believers will speak
[38:40] the same as Peter spoke Lord to whom
[38:41] shall we go you have the words of
[38:42] eternal life Ruth said entreat me not to
[38:45] leave thee or to return from following
[38:47] after thee for whether thou goest I will
[38:50] go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge
[38:53] thy people shall be my people and thy
[38:55] God my God God I don't want this God of
[38:58] Moab amen I don't want this whatever is
[39:00] here I want your God am it doesn't
[39:02] matter if everything looks like it's
[39:03] falling apart there's something in that
[39:05] land there's something in that promise
[39:06] that I want I want that don't tell me to
[39:09] leave cuz I'm getting that cuz she was
[39:11] actually a part of Naomi she just there
[39:14] was where Naomi was from was where she
[39:16] was supposed to end up cuz where our
[39:19] theophany is is where we're supposed to
[39:20] end up even though at some point we're
[39:21] out in the world and Moab we're supposed
[39:23] to end up over there so there's a
[39:25] connection that's pulling us all the
[39:27] time as brother benam said you heard
[39:28] from your theophany it's just it's
[39:30] calling
[39:31] you where thou dest will I die and there
[39:34] will I also be buried and the Lord do do
[39:37] so to me and more also if ought but
[39:40] death part thee and
[39:41] me and Naomi said that the Bible says
[39:46] that when Naomi realized that she was
[39:48] that Ruth was steadfastly minded then
[39:50] she didn't bother trying to hinder her
[39:52] anymore yes you know when someone has
[39:55] got that seed of God in them I tell you
[39:57] they're steadfastly minded for the
[39:59] things of God you can't shake them off
[40:00] nothing they just they're so fixated on
[40:03] it all the church could fall apart they
[40:05] could suffer all sorts of ridicule
[40:07] everyone make fun of them everyone leave
[40:08] them they're steadfastly minded they'll
[40:10] carry on regardless you know it's like
[40:11] the seed that just it it finds its way
[40:13] out it'll come to life that's the way
[40:15] that we
[40:17] are and now this is just Ruth natural
[40:20] she hadn't had a there was not she
[40:22] didn't know anything about the land
[40:23] there was nothing like that it was just
[40:25] Ruth and the natural this worthy Ruth
[40:27] but she said I want to go with
[40:29] you so now they turn up in this promised
[40:33] land they they make this journey
[40:35] there and I wondered how I was going to
[40:37] run this type through because it you
[40:39] know not all types sort of don't always
[40:40] work all the way through every story or
[40:42] you know they start at a certain point
[40:44] and they finished a certain point you
[40:45] can't really run them through
[40:46] there but you know when they got back
[40:49] there theyi said call me uh call me not
[40:53] Naomi which means Pleasant don't call
[40:56] call me Pleasant call me Mara which
[40:57] means bitter you know for the almighty
[40:59] ha dealt very bitterly with
[41:02] me you know I often think and that
[41:05] respect you know there were you think
[41:08] about you've got your
[41:11] theophany K Shantel everyone's got this
[41:14] theophany there there was a point in
[41:16] your life where you were so distant from
[41:18] your
[41:19] theophany was in Heavenly places and you
[41:22] were in the virtually in the pits of
[41:25] hell you know eventually we want to come
[41:28] together but you know Naomi had to make
[41:30] it all the way down to This Strange Land
[41:32] and and you know and endure this journey
[41:34] with you know just to bring that just to
[41:36] bring that that so that Ruth would come
[41:40] back when I was in
[41:44] Germany we went across the road and the
[41:46] light was red where it said walk and I
[41:49] looked left and looked right look this
[41:51] way again there were no cars so you know
[41:52] we walk and then the the brother that
[41:55] was with me the Pastor said I no no no
[41:56] we we wait for the light to go green the
[41:59] walk light he said you know in Germany
[42:02] we ever saying he said you know your
[42:03] theophany will stay on this
[42:05] side where you walk
[42:11] across we were driving to church the
[42:14] other day and one of the brothers won't
[42:15] mention who it was shot past us at about
[42:17] 120 km and I had all the boys in the car
[42:21] and I said oh look boys wave out to
[42:23] brother that's Brother s so on his way
[42:25] to church going 120
[42:28] K you know maybe his he got there before
[42:30] his
[42:31] [Laughter]
[42:35] theophany but there was a point in time
[42:37] where you know it seems at at ends you
[42:39] know where where we should be and where
[42:41] we
[42:43] are now you can picture Ruth now as
[42:47] she's coming into this land she turns up
[42:49] as a
[42:50] nobody she's got nothing she she doesn't
[42:53] belong in the land she's not from there
[42:54] she's got no family apart from naom me
[42:56] but she's a nobody when she turns up
[42:58] she's got nothing to offer she's got
[43:00] she's of no benefit to anybody
[43:02] there no benefit and so she says to
[43:07] Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and
[43:10] glean ears of corn after him in whose
[43:13] eyes in whose sight I shall find Grace
[43:16] and she said unto her go my daughter so
[43:19] she just went out looking for Grace
[43:21] because she realized I'm just totally
[43:22] unworthy I'm
[43:24] unworthy and all I'm going to be doing
[43:26] is probably going out there getting in
[43:28] somebody's way picking up wheat and
[43:31] whatever these people are harvesting
[43:33] barley it was picking up barley after
[43:36] the rapers I'm more than likely going to
[43:38] get in the way I'm of no value to them
[43:40] but I'm just going to head down the
[43:42] anyway and hopefully some of them will
[43:44] be nice to me and I'll be able to get a
[43:46] wee bit
[43:47] of uh corn or
[43:49] barley that's she's saying in herself
[43:52] I'm just totally unworthy I'm just Ruth
[43:54] the moabitas from Moab I'm here this is
[43:56] not my land I'm I'm unworthy to
[43:59] even do this but I'm just going to go
[44:01] and try and glean a bit of corn a bit of
[44:04] wheat a bit of barley and that's often
[44:06] the way that we come to God we say Lord
[44:08] I'm Just So
[44:11] Unworthy and so she went there and she
[44:13] started to glean this is Ruth the moabit
[44:15] is Ruth from the world Ruth this
[44:17] unworthy
[44:19] one and Ruth is gleaning in the field I
[44:23] put the pictures on for the children I
[44:25] wasn't going to have pictures
[44:26] but I specifically put them on for the
[44:27] children I was just going to
[44:30] preach I like nice pictures too I can't
[44:33] stand modern art abstract
[44:37] art one day there was a person that had
[44:40] a they had a rubbish bag as a piece of
[44:42] art and they put it as an exhibition and
[44:44] at at night the cleaner came in and
[44:45] threw it
[44:47] away and then the next morning the man
[44:49] says oh where's my piece of art and they
[44:50] realized it's in the bin he said they
[44:52] said I'll just go get it out of the bin
[44:53] he said no I have to make a new one
[44:55] that's too damaged
[44:56] [Music]
[44:58] this is a pathetic world we live in now
[44:59] minds of
[45:01] insane you that man needs to be told
[45:03] you're insane think
[45:06] normally get the word of God in you and
[45:08] think normally this is nonsense you know
[45:09] we need to stand up say this is
[45:11] nonsense that's what the Lord would say
[45:14] you know he was a he was a man of he
[45:16] didn't suffer fools gladly and he called
[45:19] nonsense nonsense you know we become so
[45:22] PC we end up putting up with stuff like
[45:24] that to our detriment
[45:28] now
[45:31] Ruth after a while Boaz a man called
[45:34] Boaz turns up to the field he looks
[45:36] around and he sees he sees a woman
[45:38] gleaning in the field and he asks his
[45:40] servant he said who is that
[45:41] woman and the servant says oh that's
[45:44] Ruth the moabitas that's that's her from
[45:47] Moab not part of us just from
[45:50] Moab out of the country of
[45:53] Moab and Boaz go goes over begins to
[45:56] talk to
[45:59] her and he says he said look I've heard
[46:03] about
[46:05] you I kind of like you you he said don't
[46:09] you know today when you're gleaning just
[46:11] stay in my field just glean here don't
[46:14] don't go and glean in other fields just
[46:16] just glean in my field stay here and you
[46:18] know maybe at lunchtime come and get
[46:20] something to eat and then come back out
[46:21] and when it's dinner come and get some
[46:22] food and then you can you can carry on
[46:26] Ruth went out looking for
[46:28] Grace I need Grace Just give me Grace
[46:32] and here comes this man and gives her
[46:35] grace because she felt like I'm So
[46:37] Unworthy now now what is she to Boaz
[46:39] really Boaz had handmaids he had workers
[46:42] he had Fields he had all the stuff what
[46:43] value was she to Boaz nothing let's be
[46:48] honest she brought no value to the table
[46:50] to no value to the relationship she was
[46:53] just coming there
[46:54] gleaning if he had told her to leave or
[46:57] stay it would have meant it would have
[46:59] been would have meant nothing to him
[47:01] either way it wouldn't have affected his
[47:02] life either way she brought nothing to
[47:05] the table she was going completely
[47:07] unworthy and she was and so are we when
[47:10] we come to Christ lot of just
[47:12] unworthy right amen and then it says
[47:14] then it says she fell on her face she
[47:17] bowed her she fell on her face and bowed
[47:19] herself to the ground and said unto him
[47:20] why have I found Grace in thine eyes
[47:22] that thou should us take knowledge of me
[47:25] seeing I am a stranger Lord I I I don't
[47:28] belong in this this is not for me you've
[47:29] just been you've been so good to give me
[47:32] Grace amen you've just given me Grace
[47:35] and I don't I don't deserve it I don't
[47:36] I'm just a stranger in this land but the
[47:39] thing about it was she
[47:40] wasn't she just had to have a revelation
[47:43] from a theophany later on that you're
[47:44] not actually a stranger in this land
[47:46] This Is Your Land but at that point she
[47:48] was just looking for Grace Lord just be
[47:49] merciful to me you know this is a part
[47:51] of our journey but we can't stay here we
[47:54] can't stay in this spot because
[47:56] there was more for her to have than just
[47:59] a bit of barley a bit of corn a bit of
[48:01] food in here you know many many
[48:03] Christians just settle for that settle
[48:05] for these good things of God without
[48:06] actually coming into a union with the
[48:09] King himself see there was a union to be
[48:12] had but but but she would never have
[48:15] thought in wildest dreams I'm going to
[48:17] have there'll be in Union with that man
[48:19] she never thought that she just thought
[48:22] wow he's given me Grace to give me all
[48:24] these good things
[48:26] many many Believers just stay here not
[48:29] you you
[48:31] know and she said
[48:33] why and boas said unto her it has been
[48:37] fully shown me all that thou Hast done
[48:39] unto thy mother-in-law since the death
[48:41] of thine husband and how thou Hast left
[48:43] thy father and thy mother and the land
[48:45] of thy Nativity and a come unto a people
[48:48] which thou knewest not here too
[48:51] for so he's kind of saying look way back
[48:54] when you made that choice and you
[48:56] decided you're going to come and and go
[48:58] with Naomi and you just you had to push
[49:00] through a bit of that persecution and
[49:01] you just had to push through I I liked
[49:04] that that's why I had Grace on
[49:08] you so it was it was purposeful Grace he
[49:11] he he actually heard about her through
[49:13] other people I've heard about you and I
[49:16] I like what you've
[49:19] done the Lord recompense thy Work and a
[49:22] full reward be given thee of the Lord
[49:25] God of Israel unto under whose wings
[49:27] Thou Art come to trust now that could
[49:28] have been the end of her relationship
[49:30] with
[49:30] Boaz thank you thank you look I'll be
[49:32] head to glean this year then I'll come
[49:33] next year I'll come the year after come
[49:35] the year after I'll just do my little
[49:36] thing because I'm Just So Unworthy I'm
[49:38] just I'm not worthy of any of this but
[49:40] thank you every year thank you thank
[49:42] you which is okay but that's not where
[49:45] we uh should be there's a point where we
[49:48] come into more than that and we realize
[49:50] who we are and who he is and more ways
[49:54] than just throwing out some coin born
[49:56] all right and this is
[49:59] where I want to bring this now to a
[50:04] revelation
[50:06] that Ruth had you could say from a
[50:10] theophany because Ruth came back and
[50:12] told
[50:14] Naomi you you won't believe this I was
[50:16] out in this such and such a field and
[50:18] look at all this look at all this Grace
[50:20] I was shine look at all this look at all
[50:22] this corn look at all this wheat look
[50:24] look at all that I've got
[50:27] and now remember this is a theophany
[50:30] this this is Naomi from that land she
[50:32] said whose field were you
[50:35] in
[50:37] and Naomi said Ruth said to Naomi uh the
[50:41] man that owns the field his name was um
[50:45] Boaz
[50:48] now Naomi gave Ruth the
[50:51] Revelation she said to her blessed be he
[50:55] of the Lord who hath not left off his
[50:57] kindness to the living and to the dead
[51:00] and Naomi said unto her this man is near
[51:04] of kin to
[51:06] us one of our next Kinsmen she didn't
[51:10] say oh bless the Lord he's near of kin
[51:12] to
[51:13] me she got a deeper Revelation this man
[51:17] is near of kin to you you're not just
[51:20] Ruth the maritus yeah come on now amen
[51:23] that's right Ruth the nobody Ruth the
[51:25] Unworthy
[51:26] one you are near kin to this man
[51:31] Boaz you you you're actually you're
[51:34] somebody this is your inheritance you
[51:37] you don't need to come and say I'm a
[51:38] stranger in the land I don't deserve any
[51:40] of this actually you do deserve this
[51:43] amen that man is your near kin see
[51:45] that's where we need to come to when we
[51:47] get that Revelation actually hold on I'm
[51:50] a part of this even though I may have
[51:52] come out of the world and come this way
[51:54] I'm from that land
[51:57] thank you Lord Jesus I'm a part of that
[51:59] and this great Redeemer
[52:02] actually dare I say it has a
[52:05] responsibility if I can put it that way
[52:07] as a kinsman redeemer to who to me yes
[52:11] sir right I'm not just a stranger I'm
[52:15] part of this promise I've got
[52:17] inheritance here that was a long way
[52:19] different thinking than just Ruth The
[52:21] Stranger Ruth the Unworthy one now she's
[52:23] thinking hold on a minute yeah am I
[52:26] worthy cuz remember it was through that
[52:28] word that she had heard that was her
[52:29] connection through this the the daughter
[52:32] uh the son of Naomi that was her
[52:35] connection she heard that word and she
[52:36] was she was connected through that but
[52:38] that word wasn't the actual thing itself
[52:40] that first husband that wasn't the
[52:41] actual thing itself she had to find The
[52:44] Giver of that word the the the voice
[52:46] behind that voice see but it was through
[52:48] that that she was connected that's why
[52:50] Naomi said it's our inheritance you
[52:53] seejah yes amen amen you see it's it's
[52:56] now it's your inheritance not just Naomi
[52:59] said it's not just mine but it's yours
[53:00] yes thank you Lord that's
[53:03] why
[53:05] when the next meeting that she has with
[53:07] Boaz is not be gracious unto me give me
[53:11] some corn give me some wheat I'm just a
[53:14] I'm just a sinner I'm Ruth from Moab now
[53:17] I don't want to say that we come to God
[53:19] like ah you you owe
[53:22] me but you see it's balanced because we
[53:25] we have to at some point realize who we
[53:26] are amen because then we can walk into
[53:29] the promises Satan always chose to say
[53:30] no it's not for you you're just Ruth the
[53:31] maitus it's not for you it's like no
[53:33] hang on hang on hang on all right no no
[53:35] I've got an inheritance I'm actually
[53:36] from here I've got an inheritance from
[53:38] this even though it feels like sometimes
[53:40] I'm not I'm So Unworthy but yet I am
[53:42] worthy I'm not going to be robbed of
[53:44] these blessings I'm not going to be
[53:45] robbed of these promises because my
[53:47] feelings tell me I'm not worthy I am
[53:49] worthy Lord so she goes to
[53:54] Boz and Boaz is laying down in the in
[53:58] the threshing floor and then he wakes up
[54:00] and he sees a woman lying at his feet
[54:02] and he's startled and he says who are
[54:06] you he said who are you now she doesn't
[54:10] answer and say I'm Ruth the
[54:12] moabitas because she's not Ruth the
[54:14] moabitas she says I'm Ruth thine
[54:16] handmaid
[54:18] Glory moreover she says spread your
[54:22] skirt over
[54:23] me for thou art a near Kinsman to me
[54:27] Hallelujah you're a Kinsman to
[54:30] me I belong to you I'm part of this
[54:33] promise there's a connection between you
[54:35] and me you're a near Kin I'm not Ruth
[54:38] the maritus I'm actually a kin to you to
[54:40] the great
[54:42] Redeemer I'm worthy spread your skirt
[54:45] over me I'm worthy because I'm part of
[54:47] this promise not because I'm anything
[54:49] but I actually I am this I am I'm a Son
[54:53] of God I'm the bride of Christ
[54:55] I'm worthy Hallelujah spread your spirit
[54:58] over me you're a near kin to me that's a
[55:00] lot different than having me some
[55:02] corn hand me some corn that's I want to
[55:05] come into a union with you redeem me
[55:07] raise up a seed raise up the Eternal
[55:10] seed in
[55:17] me Boaz what a Bo
[55:20] say I will
[55:24] amall he said I will amen what you've
[55:28] asked me to do I'll do it GL you are
[55:31] right you're correct you are my king
[55:37] you're correct you all are my king
[55:39] Hallelujah you're correct I have a
[55:41] responsibility to redeem you you're
[55:43] correct you are worthy you're worth
[55:45] redeeming you're part of
[55:47] me
[55:49] am see and but there was one issue there
[55:53] was one issue
[55:56] one last issue that they had to
[55:58] conquer was that there was another man
[56:01] that was near a king than he
[56:04] was than Boaz brother R types this man
[56:07] as the as the devil you know and in a
[56:10] way when you run it through like this
[56:12] you know he he can
[56:13] be so the custom was that boas had to go
[56:16] to the gate in the morning and and wait
[56:18] for this man to come and he has to stop
[56:19] him and say how want I have a talk with
[56:22] you now he started off talking about
[56:25] Naomi he said there's a woman Naomi that
[56:28] emik
[56:31] emik um our our
[56:34] brother
[56:36] married and he passed away and there's
[56:39] no one to um raise up seed on her
[56:42] inheritance so I want I I want to redeem
[56:47] Naomi that's what he first said he
[56:49] didn't say Ruth he said I want I want to
[56:50] redeem
[56:51] Naomi and Satan not without thinking
[56:54] about it says
[56:55] and then he and then sorry Boaz said to
[56:57] her to him to this other man uh but it's
[57:00] up to you if you want if you want to
[57:01] redeem the land and redeem them then you
[57:03] can and him without thinking said I'll
[57:05] take it I'll do it I'll do
[57:09] it but then Boaz Bo said hold on hold on
[57:13] hold
[57:14] on I didn't do that on purpose but I
[57:16] just said that no there's no CB in here
[57:19] but he did say hold on hold
[57:23] on the day you redeem
[57:26] Naomi you must redeem
[57:29] Ruth the day you redeem Naomi you must
[57:32] and what did he call her he said you
[57:34] must redeem Ruth the
[57:35] maitus you must redeem her you must you
[57:38] must be able to redeem her from that
[57:40] land you must have the power within you
[57:41] to
[57:42] redeem this body not just that body this
[57:46] body you must actually do you have the
[57:48] purchasing power in you to redeem this
[57:50] body this flesh this world this this
[57:53] Fallen man this can you redeem her yeah
[57:56] you can redeem Naomi but can you redeem
[57:58] Ruth do you have the power in you to
[58:00] redeem Ruth can you do it and he looked
[58:03] at his bank account he said I cannot do
[58:04] it I do not have the purchasing power to
[58:07] redeem Ruth oh boy I cannot do itj I
[58:10] forfeit it see God came down as a man to
[58:14] redeem Ruth the moabitas to bring her in
[58:18] Union with her theophany to make one
[58:20] complete being not just not just up
[58:22] there but he came here to redeem truth
[58:25] to redeem us to make everyone
[58:28] worthy and the the other man said I
[58:31] cannot do it I cannot redeem
[58:34] them he said okay then I redeem the
[58:36] whole lot all that was emc's all that
[58:40] was his is now
[58:41] mine and I'm going to raise up a seed on
[58:44] their inheritance which is going to be
[58:45] the promised son Hallelujah and that's
[58:47] where David came from that's right all
[58:50] that the father has given me will
[58:52] come and you know when I was was
[58:56] just thinking about this you know I I I
[58:59] I'm just enclosing now I was I was
[59:02] thinking so much about my own Journey
[59:04] how that you know I've been I've been in
[59:06] these different places in my mind where
[59:08] even in even you hear the word but even
[59:10] in your in your mind you still think
[59:11] Lord I'm So Unworthy I'm just unworthy
[59:14] but you know as you go on and as you get
[59:16] closer to your theophany and as the word
[59:17] is revealed to you more you start to
[59:20] realize yes I know I'm unworthy I've
[59:23] never disputed that but you start to get
[59:25] shine actually but actually I'm a part
[59:27] of this promise he is my
[59:31] redeemer there's there's I'm worthy of
[59:34] redemption I'm worthy to dwell in his
[59:37] courts I'm worthy to sit by his
[59:40] side not because of what I've done but
[59:42] because of who I am I'm this that's I'm
[59:46] a part of that Kingdom yeah I was born
[59:48] into
[59:49] it generational
[59:52] wealth Glory that's what we've got and
[59:56] you know it's we we in our meekness try
[59:59] not to do that but it's important that
[1:00:01] we actually by faith recognize who we
[1:00:04] are so that we can move forward into the
[1:00:06] promises of God and recognize God
[1:00:08] redeemed Christ redeemed all of us and
[1:00:11] he redeemed us because we were worthy
[1:00:13] because we were next ofin to him that's
[1:00:15] why he redeemed us and don't let Satan
[1:00:18] ever tell you you're not part of this
[1:00:19] this is not your thing like Ruth the
[1:00:21] maritus oh I'm not part of it no I'm
[1:00:23] just a stranger in the land you're not
[1:00:24] strangers you're not strangers in this

[1:00:53] anything less
[1:00:55] if you start to get a bit prideful about
[1:00:56] it then just think to yourself I'm just
[1:00:58] an unworthy
[1:00:59] servant I'm an because you're still
[1:01:01] unworthy Ruth from Moab but you know
