[42:13] here to meet the challenge of this hour
[42:15] and so you don't have to feel just a
[42:18] general Christian tonight know you're
[42:19] very special and there's as I was
[42:22] ministering over the weekend down in the
[42:24] South Island there's a place at the
[42:25] wedding supper that has your name on it
[42:27] and nobody else can fill there's no
[42:30] substitute there's nothing that God you
[42:33] know there's not somebody else he's
[42:35] going to raise up to take your place
[42:36] you're the person that's going to happen
[42:37] to you talking to the young people the
[42:39] other day I told them you might as well
[42:40] accept the fact that it's going to be
[42:41] you it's not another generation coming
[42:44] so we better rise to the occasion
[42:47] this is it this is our our this is the
[42:49] moment we were made for to express this
[42:51] is our moment on the stage where we're
[42:53] supposed to say our line and do what God
[42:56] is he's firing us to do so I believe in
[42:59] a positive gospel absolutely I really
[43:00] believe God is here to bring you into a
[43:02] higher height to bring you in that email
[43:04] kind of a walk because this is the hour
[43:05] of the translation and talk on the word
[43:08] 1953 I need to find out pointed over
[43:12] there he says what we today are God's
[43:14] spiritual church with a spiritual law
[43:17] written on the tables of our hearts led
[43:19] in a spiritual form God's intention was
[43:22] to write in our hearts and that's what
[43:24] it was such a great disappointment over
[43:26] there when Israel said put it on stone
[43:28] for us put it out there but their desire
[43:31] didn't match that law that's why they
[43:33] kept on transgressing it even while God
[43:35] was writing it down they were
[43:37] transgressing the first commandment they
[43:39] could not keep that law because the
[43:41] desire in their hearts didn't match so
[43:43] he wanted to change the desire in the
[43:45] heart and not just to give you a
[43:46] commandment give you another set of
[43:48] rules is why for many young people it's
[43:50] ood is to try and live the message
[43:52] because it's just a hundred and ten
[43:53] commandments but if it writes it on your
[43:56] heart is no longer a commandment it's no
[43:58] it's something that comes naturally to
[44:01] you
[44:01] and that's why I believe in the Baptist
[44:03] where the Holy Ghost and experience with
[44:05] God not just a knowledge or a no so I
[44:07] knew it all my life I believe that all
[44:09] my life never had power to walk in it
[44:11] until God baptized me with that Holy
[44:13] Ghost then it was a different thing then
[44:15] you can't say out of it then there's
[44:17] somebody else he control so not in the
[44:20] output keeping of Commandments but a new
[44:22] and a living ways the Bible calls it he
[44:25] is that way who was either manifested
[44:27] word the Word made flesh and when you
[44:29] take on it's like we baptize people at
[44:31] the camp and I thought that's exactly
[44:33] acts 2:38 made flesh right there in the
[44:36] water in front of us the Word made flesh
[44:39] letting off the pressure 63 says this or
[44:43] trust in his promised work his words are
[44:45] written on our heart he's words our
[44:49] hearts are the tables of his word now
[44:51] think about it what did he write for
[44:53] this time behold I show you a mystery we
[44:56] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[44:58] changed in a moment in its
[45:00] jingling of an eye where is that written
[45:02] say it's written on the Bible it's
[45:03] written here that's God's desire not on
[45:06] the page not on a book he's not
[45:07] rapturing a book but he writes it on
[45:09] your heart he's actually writing his
[45:11] very creative word in you hell the Bible
[45:15] told us by the Holy Spirit
[45:17] that's why I believe the brother quoted
[45:19] right there the beginning and hearing
[45:20] the song services to worship Him in
[45:22] spirit and truth not just in truth but
[45:25] he spirit of truth because it's that
[45:27] spirit it gives life and spirited
[45:29] quickens that word and makes it live out
[45:31] in your life that's why the Christian
[45:33] life is easy as life there is it's a
[45:35] life of yielding it's a life of giving
[45:37] up giving weight to the Holy Ghost and
[45:40] that Holy Ghost quickens the word and he
[45:42] lives it out through you you don't have
[45:44] to manufacture nothing like the Sheep
[45:45] doesn't manufacture we'll just bears it
[45:48] how just like being a sheep amen it's
[45:51] coated in there it's written in there
[45:54] and you can eat as much as much grass as
[45:56] you like it'll never bear any wool
[45:58] because it's not coated in you but it's
[46:00] coated in there so where does it will
[46:01] come from not from the grass from what's
[46:05] inside the sheep already what's written
[46:07] in there by God so God writes in you the
[46:11] message of the hour it was here to be
[46:13] expressed so Paul told those people said
[46:15] the Corinthians and told them you are my
[46:17] letter oh you're reading a letter I
[46:19] wrote words but you are the letter
[46:21] because what I wrote is taking on flesh
[46:24] and is living out in the world today God
[46:27] who is rich in mercy says God is the
[46:30] word it was made flesh and dwelt among
[46:32] us now that he might bring forth the
[46:35] other attributes of God that's Jesus
[46:37] being the fullness of the word all that
[46:39] God was poured into Christ that's my
[46:41] brother Brown has said when he was on
[46:42] the earth you were on the earth when he
[46:44] went to the cross you into the cross we
[46:46] rose from the grave you rose from the
[46:47] grave that is not a thought that's not a
[46:49] mystical something out there not a
[46:51] metaphor not an example it's a literal
[46:53] truth you were in him because he had the
[46:55] fullness of the word in him and if
[46:57] you're part of that word that part for
[46:59] today you have to being in Christ what
[47:01] he walked on the earth so he says the
[47:04] body Jesus was the body of God and
[47:06] attribute Moses seen him passed the back
[47:08] part of him no man had seen his face but
[47:10] now we see him we have beheld him see
[47:13] him as the sacrifice he's talking about
[47:15] Christ being going to Calvary
[47:17] since now see he was he was an attribute
[47:21] of God being displayed the word when
[47:23] when God gave that promise remember when
[47:26] they were had to leave Eden but God
[47:28] couldn't couldn't see them go he loved
[47:29] him too much gave that promise the seed
[47:31] of the woman shall bruise the head of
[47:33] the serpent here was that promise now
[47:35] revealed that promise taking on flesh
[47:37] that attribute of God that he spoke
[47:39] there
[47:39] he's attribute of redemption it's
[47:41] walking out in flesh and actually
[47:43] performing the task as God had set for
[47:46] him and he says here he was the word
[47:49] being displayed isn't that exactly what
[47:51] Paul told these Corinthian said you are
[47:53] the word displayed over made open
[47:55] declared revealed you become the entire
[47:59] message revealed oh it's a mystery
[48:02] violets on the book but once it takes on
[48:05] flesh in you it becomes an expression of
[48:07] what God wanted in this hour oh you
[48:09] might as well accept it yes sir uh-huh
[48:13] he says that's what he was and when any
[48:16] believer comes to God any believer say
[48:19] well that was Jesus Christ he lived such
[48:21] a perfect walk you know he manifests
[48:23] with every word never put a foot wrong
[48:24] what about little old me with all my
[48:26] mistakes says when any believer comes to
[48:30] God he becomes God's attribute of his
[48:32] word he's used to manifest the word
[48:35] that's promised for that day so when God
[48:38] said behold I send you Elijah the
[48:41] Prophet he'll turn the hearts sometimes
[48:43] we think it's just speaks about brother
[48:44] Branham who are the hearts you're as
[48:47] much a part of Malachi 4:5 as brother
[48:50] Branham is because my heart was turned
[48:54] so I'm part of that scripture that's
[48:57] taken on flesh I'm part of God today the
[49:00] word expressed for this hour this is
[49:02] this is the hour and you are born for it
[49:05] oh my what a place to stand what a
[49:08] wonderful thing that's why you call you
[49:09] that's why you came in here not because
[49:11] you willed it or decide it or that
[49:13] nothing that that was a drawing power
[49:14] what was it that predestinate elective
[49:16] love of God and place you at this end
[49:18] time to take a rapture to live through
[49:20] this change of the body to defy all the
[49:22] filth in this world to live in the
[49:24] Satan's Eden that you could live in a
[49:25] condition that was just like the book of
[49:27] Acts that's the God that's the power of
[49:29] God it's available you know what
[49:31] sometimes you hear all these great high
[49:33] things you think whoa my little life is
[49:35] so far removed I want to encourage you
[49:37] tonight whatever is whatever scene the
[49:39] word is yours tonight you don't have to
[49:40] live under your privileges you walk out
[49:42] of here say God baptized me with that
[49:44] same power that same Holy Ghost make me
[49:46] that kind of a Christian and he's here
[49:49] to do it he's exactly here to do it if
[49:51] you'll yield to him yes that's what he's
[49:53] here for
[49:54] I believe in a present tense Jesus
[49:56] Christ this is not a lecture this is not
[49:58] an information session we're here the
[50:00] very words that you hear Amendment
[50:02] Cornelius house while Peter yet spake
[50:04] these words the Holy Ghost fell upon
[50:06] them you catch the word of God the Holy
[50:08] Ghost comes in to make that word power
[50:10] if use if you'll just say yes Lord it's
[50:13] me I believe it this is my hour this is
[50:15] my day this is the time I'm gonna rise
[50:18] to the occasion I'm the actor on the
[50:20] scene here to live that word by the Holy
[50:24] Ghost power that comes into me praise
[50:27] the Lord
[50:27] oh wow you can see where we asked
[50:30] friends we're here we're in the hand of
[50:32] God tonight he says well God's purpose
[50:36] God's purpose our identity set out
[50:38] either scriptures whatever the Bible
[50:40] says is what you are not what you feel
[50:42] not what they tell you in this world not
[50:44] the identity to try and push on you or
[50:46] what you were born with your carnal
[50:48] little nature no sirs whatever the Word
[50:50] says that's what you are a man you were
[50:53] born for this hour you're anointed to
[50:55] face the challenge of this particular
[50:57] moment right where we are the anointing
[50:59] right now remember the Bible says when
[51:01] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[51:04] Spirit of God raises the standard
[51:07] man the Spirit of God raises the
[51:09] standard and he raises that standard in
[51:12] you in your life that's what the Bible
[51:15] says or you might not feel like it
[51:16] what's that got to do with it
[51:18] what if you gave a stage four cancer and
[51:19] you're gonna say well I'll look at the
[51:21] symptoms well you're dead yeah but you
[51:24] say but it's real it's there brother
[51:26] Brennan said sure it's there sure
[51:28] there's a real devil but the Bible says
[51:29] greater is He that is in me than he that
[51:31] is in the world so you've got something
[51:33] that will defeat that devil every single
[51:35] time regardless the symptoms so I got
[51:37] this complex I got this habit I can't
[51:39] break I've tried this I've gone to be
[51:41] prayed for I've been anointed I've done
[51:43] all these things brother what does the
[51:45] Bible say oh yeah an overcomer that's
[51:51] what the Bible says don't care how you
[51:53] feel you might be sick as a dog it's
[51:55] still healed yes sir a believer is what
[51:58] the Bible says exploits exploits we'll
[52:02] be done in this hour who's gonna do them
[52:05] that Holy Ghost in you that's who's
[52:07] gonna do it
[52:08] amen a wise virgin is what the Bible
[52:12] calls you Rahab Rahab Ameri you know an
[52:15] Abraham that's what the Bible calls you
[52:18] oh you might as well accept it tonight
[52:20] yes sir what the word says in type we
[52:23] will manifest and every type of speaks
[52:26] at the endtime we're here to fulfill
[52:27] that scripture what do you care whether
[52:30] you work in this city or that one
[52:32] whether you got a bigger salary over
[52:34] here then over there what doesn't matter
[52:36] you're here to fulfill the Word of God
[52:38] for this time bodies to be changed in
[52:42] the moment that's what the Bible says
[52:43] about you and the message Shalom 1964 I
[52:47] like the way brother Brennan puts it
[52:49] here he says now to you adults of
[52:51] Scripture is God's symphony God's
[52:54] symphony it's quite a complex story is
[52:56] told by a symphony it's not just a
[52:58] little bit of music to make you relax
[53:00] there's a big drama being played out in
[53:03] a symphony and it takes all the
[53:04] different twists and turns and different
[53:07] fragrances and and sometimes dark and
[53:09] sometimes light and sometimes happy and
[53:11] sometimes sad but it's all playing out
[53:13] to God's timing perfectly to express
[53:16] that great attributes of God since Oh
[53:20] the composer knows what it really means
[53:23] only the composer you know why cuz he
[53:26] heard it before he wrote it he heard it
[53:28] he had the exact expression there and
[53:31] then he captured it in that music and he
[53:33] gave little instructions there little
[53:35] hints along the way to the musicians who
[53:37] will be performing this in a director
[53:39] who bill directing it directing it but
[53:42] only the composer knows and I look at
[53:44] this and he says and he reveals it to
[53:47] those who are listening who are
[53:49] interested in knowing what the drama is
[53:52] what gave you a thirst like that what
[53:55] created that something in you you know
[53:57] it's the best evidence that you were
[53:59] part of God's economy if they're just
[54:01] and he calls it a little dim something a
[54:04] little tug in your heart the devil won't
[54:07] give you that tub and Jesus said those
[54:11] who have the talk I will in no wise cast
[54:12] out those that come to me won't be
[54:15] turned down so there's a tug in your
[54:17] heart tonight you know it comes from God
[54:19] and he wouldn't put it there unless
[54:21] you're part of that economy oh I don't
[54:24] care how miserable your life might be
[54:25] what a kind of a hypocrite you feel like
[54:27] you are it doesn't matter at all if God
[54:29] is doing the drawing there's nothing
[54:31] that nothing that'll prevent you from
[54:33] coming to coming to maturity so but you
[54:36] have to know what the sympathy the
[54:38] sympathy calls it here first I like that
[54:40] you see it's not just something you see
[54:43] it's the it's the changing the
[54:46] Junction's of the word or the music and
[54:48] we are at the greatest Junction ever we
[54:51] hear the Bible calls of the fullness of
[54:52] time we'll touch on it later says it
[54:54] throws sometimes it's going this away
[54:58] for a while
[54:59] a certain beat after a while changes all
[55:02] around what is it to you who wouldn't
[55:04] understand it or don't know nothing
[55:05] about it not interested in it it's just
[55:06] a racket just a fuss what are these
[55:09] people shouting about what's wrong with
[55:11] him why do they come here on a weeknight
[55:14] just a fuss praise the Lord
[55:19] says but through those who know about it
[55:21] they're watching for it they know it's
[55:23] coming they know it's coming remember
[55:26] that little Dew Drop brother round talks
[55:27] about oh it's been lying there all night
[55:29] long it fell from the heavens came down
[55:31] is sitting there on the leaf waiting
[55:33] waiting but just before that dawn on the
[55:35] Sun starts rising is a little tremble it
[55:37] goes through that little Dew Drop lie
[55:38] because it knows the power to take it
[55:40] back to the heavens it's coming it's
[55:43] coming and so they start stirring that's
[55:45] what's stirring your heart that's what's
[55:46] stirring the people today that power
[55:48] that's rising upon you right now right
[55:50] now because it's almost over
[55:52] we're almost there oh brother said God
[55:56] was not caught off guard you know he
[55:59] wasn't caught off guard when the madman
[56:01] man fell in sin he didn't have to make a
[56:03] plan quickly oh no sorry it was already
[56:06] written in a drama you already knew what
[56:08] the answer was and that promise who went
[56:11] out there you already had a lamb slain
[56:12] the Bible says he was slain from the
[56:14] foundation of the world there was
[56:15] already a way out provided and the
[56:19] quality of the Holy Ghost today faces
[56:21] the challenge of the day that's exactly
[56:23] what God does that is a living word
[56:25] that's a living way now the seat has to
[56:27] go into the ground we know the great
[56:28] symphony is God played it out through
[56:30] the ages that seed going to ground
[56:31] through the seven ages and how they how
[56:33] it worked out and not to kind of spend
[56:35] time on that we all know it well the
[56:37] church wasn't defeated at Nicaea it was
[56:40] supposed to go that way there was the
[56:42] sound of the symphony there was the
[56:43] sound of the drama it had to go into
[56:45] that winter it had to go into that
[56:46] darkness so the springtime could come
[56:48] around that a restoration could flow out
[56:50] say well it looked like a defeat from
[56:52] the outside there well if you looked at
[56:54] the outside of Calvary what did the feet
[56:55] that was not realizing what was
[56:57] happening behind the scenes oh sure he
[57:00] descended into hell - what as a sinner
[57:02] Oh - take those keys of death hell in
[57:05] the grave to take over that's what he
[57:08] went there for sure cuz the price was
[57:10] paid amen so we see those minor chords
[57:14] playing during the dark ages and here
[57:16] wintered setting darkness flooding the
[57:18] earth for that spring could be announced
[57:20] and the restoration could begin from the
[57:22] beginning all these heroes of faith you
[57:24] read the book of the Hebrews chapter 11
[57:26] those heroes of faith and you see there
[57:28] they were prompted by faith moved by
[57:31] faith what his faith is the
[57:33] violation of the will of God for that
[57:35] hour it's not just a good life a moral
[57:37] life you could be as good as you wanted
[57:39] to be if you didn't enter the ark in the
[57:41] days of Noah you drowned with the rest
[57:42] so it didn't matter how much you thought
[57:44] you were patting yourself after God's
[57:46] will there was a particular particular
[57:48] instruction for a particular hour and
[57:51] you had to meet up with God's program
[57:52] God's symphony whatever God's director
[57:55] was showing at that point you had to be
[57:57] playing there you can't just play some
[57:58] random tune of your own and say well
[57:59] that's a good tune forget the good tune
[58:02] is God's tune or no no dude so able as
[58:06] the Bible says able by faith prompted by
[58:09] faith moved by faith Abel offered not
[58:12] not because you know Oh Adam whispered
[58:14] in his ear it's a lamb it's a lamb hey
[58:16] that didn't happen God was moving on his
[58:19] heart to show it will take an innocent
[58:21] life in the place of your guilty life
[58:23] and an innocent blood must be shed
[58:25] that's what was happening there you know
[58:27] what it's no different to the Holy Ghost
[58:29] today prompting you moving you when the
[58:32] whole Christian world is believing in a
[58:33] Trinity doctrine baptizing some strange
[58:35] way God takes you right into acts 2:38
[58:38] God's takes you takes you through the
[58:39] water and the way they did in the Bible
[58:41] why cuz it's that same prompting of
[58:43] faith that same Holy Ghost moving on
[58:45] your life yes sir a more excellent
[58:49] sacrifice to Bible calls at Enoch by
[58:51] faith by faith Enoch was translated what
[58:55] is faith remember again it's not just
[58:57] that little something that you know I'm
[58:59] healed and so forth it's much more than
[59:00] a revelation of the God's will God
[59:03] didn't want to let him carry on war he
[59:05] just I'm not gonna just come on up home
[59:08] there it is we're living in that very
[59:11] hour that very time Enoch a type of you
[59:15] yes sir
[59:16] Noah my faith saved his household the
[59:20] Bible says direct instruction from God
[59:24] it only Noah could hear Abraham left his
[59:28] homeland by faith you go read that
[59:30] chapter again you see they did strange
[59:32] things they did impossible things why
[59:35] because the Spirit of God is moving upon
[59:37] them now think about it this is your
[59:39] hour
[59:39] this is your day the Spirit of God is
[59:41] here to move on you to do strange things
[59:44] to do odd things
[59:46] I love this one by faith Sara received
[59:49] strength Wow by faith we read about Sara
[59:53] we think all she doubted she laughed
[59:55] poor Sara God would have killed her if
[59:58] Abraham wasn't there gonna get stuck on
[1:00:00] that go read what God said about or in
[1:00:02] wrote in Hebrews 11 by faith Sara
[1:00:05] received strength to bring forth what
[1:00:09] about it friends oh you could be in
[1:00:10] whatever condition you like and never
[1:00:12] write anybody off
[1:00:13] never never write anybody off you just
[1:00:18] you just you just keep on reporting them
[1:00:20] to the management and he'll take care of
[1:00:25] it yes sir Isaac blessed Jacob the Bible
[1:00:29] through there you see some strange
[1:00:30] scriptures in this in this in this
[1:00:32] chapter of faith by faith Isaac blessed
[1:00:37] Jacob and Esau concerning Saint things
[1:00:39] to come lady out there hold the course
[1:00:42] of their lives and their nations by that
[1:00:46] blessing by faith not by tradition not
[1:00:50] because it was the done thing or because
[1:00:53] Jacob deceived him that nothing's
[1:00:55] mentioned there it says by faith and
[1:00:57] inspiration from God Jacob did those
[1:00:59] things
[1:01:00] Joseph prophesied Joseph prophesied
[1:01:04] remember when he was down there he knew
[1:01:06] there was going to be a sorry I skipped
[1:01:07] that one
[1:01:09] Jacob blessing the sons of Joseph God
[1:01:11] crossed my hands he said you know and
[1:01:14] Jacob or Joseph being down there in
[1:01:16] Egypt in that you know he wasn't he knew
[1:01:18] there was going to be a resurrection way
[1:01:20] up in Palestine how did he know that
[1:01:22] where is that written between the Lions
[1:01:25] sure and he caught that inspiration by
[1:01:28] faith he knew and he said don't leave me
[1:01:30] down here when you leave how did you
[1:01:33] know they were going to leave things
[1:01:34] were going fine in the days of Joseph
[1:01:37] they were prosperous they were living
[1:01:38] down in Egypt they were protected they
[1:01:40] were taking care of the Egyptian armies
[1:01:42] were out there fighting their battles
[1:01:43] for them but they knew Joseph knew there
[1:01:46] was going to be a pharaoh didn't know
[1:01:48] him get rise on the scene why because
[1:01:50] God has given that promise to Abraham
[1:01:52] your siedel's sojourn for so long in
[1:01:54] that strange land then I will bring him
[1:01:57] out and he said when God brings you out
[1:01:59] don't leave me
[1:02:00] down here because there's going to be a
[1:02:01] resurrection over there in Palestine by
[1:02:04] faith he could look into the future to a
[1:02:06] resurrection Moses by faith Moses was
[1:02:11] hid by his parents
[1:02:14] that wasn't Moses faith no sir because
[1:02:18] the season was coming around for the
[1:02:20] deliverer and now God is prompting
[1:02:22] moving on people it's a season for the
[1:02:24] rapture right now God is moving
[1:02:26] prompting people bringing them into
[1:02:28] position oh yeah just Terry a little
[1:02:31] longer at the prayer meeting you just
[1:02:32] stay a little longer here just put that
[1:02:34] person on your heart to pray for you
[1:02:36] think that's my chance because you feel
[1:02:38] like it it's the Holy Ghost moving on
[1:02:39] you it's God preparing a people for the
[1:02:42] hour to face that hour amen there was
[1:02:45] Moses all his life refused the Egyptian
[1:02:47] inheritance by faith not because by a
[1:02:50] biological decision not at all by faith
[1:02:53] he refused that Egyptian inheritance I'm
[1:02:55] not part of this looks enticing looks
[1:02:58] pretty good but I'm not part of this I
[1:03:00] rather take my weight with the Lord's
[1:03:02] despised theory forsook Egypt the Bible
[1:03:04] says kept the Passover I thought he was
[1:03:06] kicked out didn't the Bible say Pharaoh
[1:03:08] banished sima kind of kicked him out in
[1:03:10] violence is here by faith he forsook
[1:03:12] Egypt oh God looks at it very
[1:03:14] differently passed through the Red Sea
[1:03:18] kept the Passover all those things the
[1:03:21] walls of Jericho by faith the walls of
[1:03:24] Jericho came down by faith Rahab the
[1:03:27] harlot yes sir it includes her in there
[1:03:31] perished not because she had received
[1:03:33] those spies what told her to become an
[1:03:36] enemy of the state Justin she's never
[1:03:41] saw one miracle just heard yeah and that
[1:03:44] was enough faith and that free
[1:03:45] inspiration for her oh well what if what
[1:03:48] about you hey you weren't in those big
[1:03:50] healing campaigns but here you what make
[1:03:53] you believe the same inspiration the
[1:03:56] same faith the same spirit of God moving
[1:03:59] on the people from the highways and the
[1:04:01] hedges the nobodies of the world I read
[1:04:03] the quote on the weekend the slums of
[1:04:05] the world brother Branham called he
[1:04:06] called you out of the slums of the world
[1:04:09] to be at that wedding supper all the
[1:04:12] heroes are the ages you go through and
[1:04:13] run through we'll just skip through here
[1:04:14] the that line anointing on the first age
[1:04:18] those the the anointing of the Ox the
[1:04:20] martyr is going into those arenas what
[1:04:22] they went in there by faith by
[1:04:23] inspiration by the Holy Ghost nothing
[1:04:26] else is here you read accounts even in
[1:04:28] one of our history socials books in the
[1:04:30] schools in Canada I know because I
[1:04:31] taught it for awhile they bring about
[1:04:33] this account first-hand account from
[1:04:35] martyrs going into those arenas two
[1:04:38] girls we'd say teenage girls standing
[1:04:42] that arena and the gladiator hesitated
[1:04:44] because he felt he couldn't kill them
[1:04:47] and they were so inspired to die that
[1:04:50] the only one of the two took his hand
[1:04:52] and guided the sword into her that's
[1:04:55] there was no pain there was no tears
[1:04:57] there was no crying they were singing
[1:04:58] all the way through
[1:04:59] they were so anointed they were so in
[1:05:01] God's program in God's Symphony like
[1:05:04] like we'd look at the very first martyr
[1:05:06] Stephen
[1:05:07] well the Branham said if he didn't feel
[1:05:09] those stones and Bible said he didn't
[1:05:11] die the Bible said he fell asleep and he
[1:05:14] was transformed in that moment he said I
[1:05:16] see heavens open something happened to
[1:05:18] him he was translated he said well he
[1:05:22] suffered he certainly did not it was the
[1:05:24] guy whose guys that killed him that
[1:05:25] suffer was poor Paul standing there they
[1:05:27] could never get away from that moment
[1:05:30] all the heroes going through the
[1:05:33] faithful martyrs it would give ever
[1:05:34] marbled and the Bible calls his name
[1:05:36] before he was even on the earth
[1:05:39] somebody's name is in the scriptures
[1:05:41] that faith Antipas my faithful martyr
[1:05:44] before he arrived I guess a lot of
[1:05:47] mothers must have named their sons
[1:05:48] Antipas although maybe they didn't want
[1:05:49] to be martyrs right but there he was God
[1:05:52] identified him by name before he arrived
[1:05:55] like was God knew the attribute God knew
[1:05:57] the expression in that time it was going
[1:05:59] to take on a body called Antipas and
[1:06:01] that martyr spurt that anointing this
[1:06:03] item is God take him through that
[1:06:05] martyrdom a faithful martyr say what
[1:06:09] about you how can we fail how can we
[1:06:11] fail to express exactly what God said
[1:06:13] for this hour we can't do it he already
[1:06:15] called you he already brought you where
[1:06:17] before the foundation remember in the in
[1:06:19] in in in
[1:06:20] visible Union he says where did he slip
[1:06:22] that ring on your finger before there
[1:06:24] was the world not now when you got
[1:06:26] married and now now when you took his
[1:06:27] name but you always had his name that's
[1:06:28] why you took it now because you're
[1:06:30] always the eagle in the barn yours is my
[1:06:32] perfect example didn't it wasn't
[1:06:34] changing to an eagle he was always an
[1:06:35] eagle that's why I could hear the scream
[1:06:37] would respond to it and that's why when
[1:06:40] it sounded over here there's nothing you
[1:06:42] can do that's the quickening power of
[1:06:44] God spoken the time you're in is going
[1:06:46] to transform you and you'll realize my
[1:06:48] appetites not for this barnyard stuff
[1:06:50] yeah others may crow on the dunghill not
[1:06:53] me
[1:06:53] I'm not interested in that I don't fit
[1:06:55] here there's a deeper calling my life I
[1:06:58] can't understand it but I'm not meant
[1:06:59] for this there's something greater for
[1:07:02] me and of course when that call comes
[1:07:04] well how it does change you acting out
[1:07:08] they're part of the symphony each one
[1:07:09] acting out the missionaries came the
[1:07:11] Reformers came all these people that the
[1:07:14] stock the stock shooting up and those
[1:07:16] those leaves going to the four corners
[1:07:17] of the world that the life that's coming
[1:07:20] through that plant spreading out why
[1:07:22] because it's the season and that's the
[1:07:24] nature was in the seed that went into
[1:07:25] the ground
[1:07:26] all right nothing no merit to the plant
[1:07:27] it's a life who was in the seed and here
[1:07:31] we are in that same seed life again now
[1:07:33] they Bible says without us can't be made
[1:07:35] perfect can't be completed the picture
[1:07:38] is not complete without you if it took
[1:07:43] human courage I would encourage you
[1:07:45] tonight but it takes more than that we
[1:07:47] all know it and that's why we are here
[1:07:49] for a baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:07:52] time you hear the word it's turned into
[1:07:54] power that's what it does that's the
[1:07:56] kingdom of God the Bible tells us so
[1:07:58] what are we to Express I want to kind of
[1:08:00] stand still a bit on that tonight
[1:08:02] what are we to express in this hour what
[1:08:04] does your life or it's your life
[1:08:05] supposed to look like and I'm not
[1:08:07] talking about trying to follow a some
[1:08:09] pattern or code of conduct or some
[1:08:11] ethics or a good life that the rich
[1:08:13] young ruler tried that didn't work
[1:08:16] brother Branham and I'm not gonna say
[1:08:18] these are all the qualities but I want
[1:08:21] to highlight some of them I believe God
[1:08:24] you know it doesn't waste time doesn't
[1:08:25] waste your time somewhere along the line
[1:08:29] he said and I always say this and it's
[1:08:31] very important I have a lot of
[1:08:32] information on the screen don't try and
[1:08:33] remember that
[1:08:34] there's no quiz at the end of the
[1:08:35] service yeah passing grade that doesn't
[1:08:38] exist he might speak just one line - you
[1:08:40] don't miss that line that's all keep
[1:08:43] your heart keep your heart so in tune
[1:08:45] with him and say lord when it comes let
[1:08:46] me hear it let me receive it it might be
[1:08:49] the whole service I don't know maybe you
[1:08:51] got a big pot tonight to fill up but I
[1:08:52] don't know some sometimes we don't feel
[1:08:54] that way you know really because we got
[1:08:56] so much stuff in our heads and so much
[1:08:57] on our plate it's kind of hard to juggle
[1:08:59] everything but there's a line coming for
[1:09:01] you that's guaranteed or you wouldn't be
[1:09:02] here so in the message Christ revealed
[1:09:06] in his own word 1965 where the Brennan
[1:09:08] says this talking about stabilizers and
[1:09:10] I believe very much in stabilizers that
[1:09:12] little picture up there you can see that
[1:09:13] ship that stabilizer on the side there
[1:09:16] and they got some fancy stuff today it
[1:09:18] kind of it knows by itself the captain
[1:09:20] doesn't even have to control that it's a
[1:09:22] there's there's a code there's a program
[1:09:24] in the ship and that's the sensors can
[1:09:26] pick up as their waters are getting a
[1:09:28] little rough and then it compensates
[1:09:30] there's something in your life it
[1:09:32] compensates when it gets rough when the
[1:09:34] trials come there's something in there
[1:09:35] to compensate brother Branham says this
[1:09:38] he says a fine Minister said a while ago
[1:09:39] say brother Branham if I could just have
[1:09:41] the joy of the Lord in my heart I said
[1:09:45] son the revivals over you mean we can't
[1:09:48] have joy of course we can have joy it's
[1:09:49] in the word and and it says the joy of
[1:09:52] the Lord is your strength
[1:09:53] right so if you don't have you don't
[1:09:55] have strength you know what you wonder
[1:09:56] what's going on oh maybe I don't have
[1:09:58] the joy I should have and it's enjoy the
[1:10:00] Lord take note not the joy of the world
[1:10:02] okay here what did Jesus say here you'll
[1:10:05] have tribulation yeah you're gonna have
[1:10:07] trouble but be of good cheer how can I
[1:10:10] be of good cheer when I have trouble
[1:10:11] because I have overcome the world he
[1:10:13] said so there we are there's a there's a
[1:10:16] joy that doesn't make any sense that's
[1:10:18] the kind of joy we're talking about
[1:10:19] that's the joy of the Lord amen not 1 -
[1:10:21] everything's going well when it's not
[1:10:22] going well
[1:10:24] that's tough I know I feel I failed
[1:10:27] there just about all the time but
[1:10:28] there's somebody who can't fail
[1:10:30] somebody's already overcome in my place
[1:10:33] since I said son the revivals over see
[1:10:35] the stabilizers being put on the ship
[1:10:37] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:10:40] us but we know just beyond that wave
[1:10:43] yonder we're nearing this the shore sea
[1:10:45] we're nearing the shore here's what a
[1:10:48] stabilizer is just stay stable just stay
[1:10:56] in the word stay with God no matter how
[1:10:59] you feel
[1:11:00] what anything else stay right with the
[1:11:03] word let it stay stable when you see all
[1:11:05] these great big old clouds around us and
[1:11:07] storms are coming and atomic bombs and
[1:11:09] everything else they're talking about
[1:11:10] but our stabilizer is right straight in
[1:11:13] the word God said it would be here we'll
[1:11:15] crest
[1:11:16] every one of them Amen it's already been
[1:11:19] spoken about you says yeah we'll go
[1:11:21] right over the top of them yes indeed
[1:11:25] they can't sink us they can't drown us
[1:11:27] you put us in the grave we'll come out
[1:11:29] again just this just all there is to it
[1:11:32] since there ain't no way in the world to
[1:11:34] keep it down there will Crist every one
[1:11:35] of them cause our great chief captain is
[1:11:37] calling at the other side oh if you can
[1:11:40] just get quiet enough you'll hear that
[1:11:41] call mm-hmm every time you open the
[1:11:44] Bible to Lord oh I'm so tired the days
[1:11:46] be long don't just get there just get
[1:11:50] quiet for a bit he'll talk to you out of
[1:11:54] one verse you don't have to read all
[1:11:56] chapter for your conscience sake just
[1:11:59] Lord speak to me what else there
[1:12:04] stabilisers I believe we are supposed to
[1:12:07] manifest faithfulness this is something
[1:12:10] special you know because we know it
[1:12:12] takes God's faith yeah Paul said the
[1:12:15] life I now live in the flesh is by the
[1:12:17] faith of the Son of God not my faith the
[1:12:20] faith of the Son of God Peter went
[1:12:21] through the gate beautiful and he said
[1:12:22] you're looking at us as if we erased
[1:12:24] that man up it wasn't us it was the
[1:12:26] faith of the Son of God Jesus faith
[1:12:28] takes Jesus faith in me
[1:12:31] that's what's gonna change his body I
[1:12:33] don't have much but there's something
[1:12:35] the Bible calls faith which really means
[1:12:37] faithfulness you're watching the in the
[1:12:40] church age book retire in age where the
[1:12:42] Branham brings it out sees when he
[1:12:43] talked to the AG says I know thy faith
[1:12:45] sorry you did I skip that I know thy
[1:12:48] faith since now he does not say as he
[1:12:51] did here to the church in Pergamos you
[1:12:52] hold my faith so what is our faith you
[1:12:55] want to want to ask because he's not
[1:12:57] talking about his faith now but he's
[1:12:59] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:13:02] see not faith faithfulness so what is
[1:13:05] that and as he does he also mentions
[1:13:07] their patients now faithfulness and
[1:13:09] patience go together he says in fact
[1:13:12] patience is the outcome of faithfulness
[1:13:15] Wow just four it says in James 1:3 the
[1:13:19] trying of your your faith worketh
[1:13:22] patience right there's absolutely no
[1:13:25] other way in which to gain patience
[1:13:28] newsflash what is the trying of your
[1:13:31] faith when you don't get your answer
[1:13:33] immediately when you have to wait 25
[1:13:36] years that's the trying of your faith
[1:13:39] that's why it works patience right and
[1:13:42] that was attributed to Abraham for what
[1:13:44] righteousness okay
[1:13:46] just has to come by the trial of our
[1:13:49] faith Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh
[1:13:52] patience Wow nobody volunteers for that
[1:13:55] I quoted this on the camp and don't
[1:13:59] misunderstand me I like to quote it from
[1:14:01] time to time and there's a context sure
[1:14:03] but brother Branham made this statement
[1:14:04] and when he made it I it struck me he
[1:14:07] said you'd had you'll have your hell
[1:14:08] here or hereafter here it's temporary
[1:14:13] there lasts pretty long time and it ends
[1:14:15] in the lake of fire but you're going to
[1:14:18] have to go through something there's no
[1:14:20] way to gain character or develop or be
[1:14:22] expressed unless there's a battle unless
[1:14:24] there's a struggle and nobody wants it
[1:14:26] I'm not saying Oh Lord increased my
[1:14:28] troubles I don't thinks nobody asked
[1:14:30] that since no Jesus himself he was on
[1:14:32] the earth and said look let the cup pass
[1:14:34] well how about that so it's not like we
[1:14:38] have an excuse to be weak but there's no
[1:14:40] way we're going to ask for a cancer
[1:14:42] there's no way we're gonna ask for you
[1:14:43] know let my whole family back slow
[1:14:45] nobody wants that but when it happens
[1:14:48] it's for a purpose
[1:14:50] there's a reason there's something God
[1:14:51] isn't some part of the symphony God
[1:14:53] wants to play and it's gonna be you it's
[1:14:56] gonna be your voice your patience your
[1:14:57] faithfulness Wow
[1:15:01] he says how highly God regards this
[1:15:03] outworking of our patience is seen in
[1:15:05] James 1 4 but let patience have her
[1:15:08] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:15:09] entire lacking nothing since the God's
[1:15:12] will for us is perfection Jesus said so
[1:15:16] that's the requirement be you therefore
[1:15:19] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:15:20] perfect okay let's just give up right
[1:15:23] now when Jesus the fullness of the
[1:15:28] Godhead and a sinless virtuous body on
[1:15:30] the earth when when the rich young ruler
[1:15:32] called him good he said don't call me
[1:15:34] good really so how dare we call one
[1:15:39] another good Wow he said God's will for
[1:15:44] us his perfection that perfection is
[1:15:46] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:15:50] God
[1:15:50] oh brother I thought it was seven steps
[1:15:53] up and then I tick off this box and then
[1:15:56] I move on to a higher realm and I'm more
[1:15:58] spiritual than you no sir it's waiting
[1:16:03] on God waiting for God yeah this is the
[1:16:06] process of character development wow I
[1:16:09] guess you know all these things I just
[1:16:11] underline things you know that's what I
[1:16:12] do so I'm gonna jump off there because
[1:16:16] we got a few other hurdles to go before
[1:16:18] we close we are supposed to manifest and
[1:16:21] this never changes this is ageless those
[1:16:26] fruits of the spirit that
[1:16:27] characteristics of God's Spirit is
[1:16:28] always there and say well I don't have
[1:16:31] like two of them I don't even know if I
[1:16:33] have one well they're yours and we and
[1:16:36] we take this by faith like everything
[1:16:39] like you take healing just the same
[1:16:40] thing against the symptoms against the
[1:16:43] temper tantrums
[1:16:44] against the rough edges in your
[1:16:45] character you say well it's not he's not
[1:16:47] refining your character either he's
[1:16:49] manifesting his character
[1:16:52] patience meekness godliness knowledge
[1:16:55] all those things
[1:16:55] temperance faith brotherly kindness the
[1:16:57] love of God how all by the Holy Ghost
[1:16:59] its fruits after what the spirit so it's
[1:17:03] the spirit in you that'll bear that
[1:17:05] fruit second Peter one I love this this
[1:17:08] to me is just a huge huge huge promise
[1:17:10] if you don't happy with yourself like me
[1:17:12] then this promise is for you
[1:17:14] second Peter one according as his divine
[1:17:17] power his divine power hath past tense
[1:17:21] given us what all things that pertain
[1:17:27] unto life and godliness already given
[1:17:31] it's already in here it's not coming
[1:17:32] from heaven tonight if you have the
[1:17:34] Baptist of the Holy Ghost those
[1:17:35] qualities are in you already since
[1:17:38] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:17:40] called us to the glory glory and virtue
[1:17:42] that's your calling glory and virtue
[1:17:45] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:17:48] great and precious promises that by
[1:17:51] these what the promises we might be
[1:17:56] partakers of the divine nature God's own
[1:17:59] nature God's own character he'll by a
[1:18:02] promise and what happens to a promise
[1:18:04] has to be planted in somebody's heart
[1:18:06] has to be watered with praise thank you
[1:18:09] Lord for healing me when you're blind as
[1:18:11] a bat
[1:18:11] but you say it anyhow why because the
[1:18:13] word says it and by that watering a
[1:18:16] phrase what happens you're being
[1:18:17] transformed before you know it the world
[1:18:20] don't recognize me you don't even
[1:18:22] recognize yourself because God's
[1:18:24] transforming power will bring out of you
[1:18:26] the qualities that he has planted with
[1:18:27] this age receiving by faith what you
[1:18:32] cannot see remember faith is the
[1:18:34] substance of things we can't see the
[1:18:36] evidence of things we can't see can't
[1:18:38] feel can't understand we're here we're
[1:18:42] here to manifest that endtime light now
[1:18:44] I love these you know what God said
[1:18:46] about you when you talked about the end
[1:18:48] time in Zechariah 14:16 to pass in that
[1:18:50] day the light shall not be clearer nor
[1:18:52] dark but it shall be one day we shall be
[1:18:54] known to the Lord not day nor night but
[1:18:56] it shall come to pass at at evening time
[1:18:58] it shall be light that's not the moon
[1:19:01] that's not the Sun okay it's not these
[1:19:05] big lights that
[1:19:06] up at the stadium what did Jesus say you
[1:19:10] are the light of the world so what's the
[1:19:14] light shining oh brother branham he's
[1:19:15] come and gone there's a message now
[1:19:17] there's a people Jesus never went he's
[1:19:22] still here brother Brad said the angel
[1:19:24] of the Lord is still here to lead the
[1:19:25] church like he did in the first Exodus
[1:19:27] same angel of the Lord where is he he's
[1:19:29] right prison here if God would open your
[1:19:31] eyes you'd see him tonight sure
[1:19:33] absolutely
[1:19:35] Isaiah 60 verse 1 we know this so well I
[1:19:37] love this so personal for me arise shine
[1:19:39] for thy light has come not a light my
[1:19:42] light has come yes sir and the glory of
[1:19:47] the Lord is risen upon thee personal not
[1:19:50] upon the age not upon the church but
[1:19:53] upon you personal for behold the
[1:19:55] darkness shall cover the earth gross
[1:19:57] darkness the people oh my goodness if we
[1:19:58] ever had that it's here right now I
[1:20:00] don't have to underline it for you but
[1:20:01] the Lord shall rise upon thee who's that
[1:20:03] light it's the Lord shall rise upon the
[1:20:06] east glory shall be seen upon the his
[1:20:08] glory Wow think about Mount
[1:20:10] Transfiguration think about it like me
[1:20:12] so bright they couldn't stand it
[1:20:13] they got all religions one of the book
[1:20:15] Tabernacles and start denominations and
[1:20:17] things but the fact is God said hear ye
[1:20:18] him oh and Jesus said if you speak if
[1:20:23] you say not if you pray to me if you say
[1:20:28] so who's speaking it's the same one on
[1:20:30] Mount Transfiguration say well I've been
[1:20:32] what the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:20:34] me oh I know we can't get it no can't
[1:20:39] get brother Brent says the law that
[1:20:40] controls us or we all all create private
[1:20:43] worlds and go live on it dodge all our
[1:20:46] trials just hear about a sickness and
[1:20:48] speaker gone but God controls it by a
[1:20:50] law God throws the switch when when the
[1:20:54] symphony changes oh but you can already
[1:20:58] feel a change in cancer oh brother what
[1:21:03] a time to be alive
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:06] and have not I Cynthia and I gotta hurry
[1:21:08] up here he says but it's time for the
[1:21:10] evening lights to be shining that's you
[1:21:11] now now he's gonna bring it he's gonna
[1:21:12] say it I'm not cooking this up friends
[1:21:14] that's why I like putting it up here
[1:21:15] because I stack up the evidence on you
[1:21:17] you said oh it's brother a B saying this
[1:21:19] or that no no uh-uh it's right the car
[1:21:21] coming right straight out of Scripture
[1:21:23] coming right straight out of message at
[1:21:24] you and you've got to do something with
[1:21:26] it now it's on your hands okay Wow it's
[1:21:30] time for the evening lights Laurel to be
[1:21:32] shining he says as the song says shall
[1:21:35] be light in the evening time it's time
[1:21:36] for those evening lights to shine this
[1:21:37] is the time now what's to keep them from
[1:21:41] shining since you go out any day any day
[1:21:43] you want to just move back all the
[1:21:44] clouds in the sun is shining anyhow
[1:21:47] since the sun shining all the time just
[1:21:51] move the clouds is the same God that
[1:21:54] healed the same God filled with the Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost the same God made every promise is
[1:21:59] he says the Esso end of God is shining
[1:22:01] at all times just move the clouds of
[1:22:05] doubt out of the way he is the same
[1:22:07] yesterday today forever there it is the
[1:22:10] light of the world the God's light
[1:22:11] reflected off you I'm probably going to
[1:22:14] get to that evening star so don't want
[1:22:15] to jump right there to it now just in a
[1:22:18] minute what what else have thus saith
[1:22:21] the Lord the Bible says you have thus
[1:22:22] saith the Lord but you know it's just as
[1:22:23] important I believe to keep still when
[1:22:25] you don't have it the Bible tells us in
[1:22:28] Romans 8 as those them that are led by
[1:22:31] the Spirit of God they are the sons
[1:22:33] sometimes you quoted the other way
[1:22:35] around and we say those that are led
[1:22:37] those the sons of God are led by the
[1:22:39] Spirit God now that's true but the
[1:22:41] identification of a son of God is he's
[1:22:43] led by the spirt which means he doesn't
[1:22:45] just go blast this and blast that he's
[1:22:48] sensitive to the leading of the Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost
[1:22:50] right in the pergamene church a church
[1:22:54] age book we know this quote well just
[1:22:55] want to put it up there again for your
[1:22:56] reminder he said those in the bride do
[1:22:58] only his will no one make them do I can
[1:23:03] make them do otherwise they have none
[1:23:04] say the Lord or they keep still
[1:23:06] that's hard isn't it the keeping still
[1:23:09] part they know that it has to be God in
[1:23:12] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:23:14] word they didn't he did not complete all
[1:23:17] his work while he was in his earthly
[1:23:19] ministry so now he works in and through
[1:23:20] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:23:24] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:23:28] that he must now do he must now do but
[1:23:32] he will now fulfill through the bride
[1:23:34] that work which he left for this
[1:23:36] specific time yes sir
[1:23:39] here's a tough one and I just mentioned
[1:23:41] it earlier but conducting ourselves with
[1:23:43] joy Isaiah 60:1 you know I love this
[1:23:49] part to remember the second part of that
[1:23:50] was fulfilled in our day Jesus stopped
[1:23:53] halfway through the verse but here at
[1:23:57] well let's take from verse 3 he says to
[1:23:59] appoint under them that mourn in Zion to
[1:24:01] give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil
[1:24:03] of joy for mourning the garment of
[1:24:06] praise for the spirit of heaviness now
[1:24:08] there's a spirit of heaviness and it
[1:24:10] tries to get on you just about everyday
[1:24:12] but you just exchange it say no no I
[1:24:15] have a garment of praise that's what he
[1:24:19] says about me yes sir I have a garment
[1:24:21] of praise that they might be called
[1:24:23] trees of righteousness the planting of
[1:24:24] the Lord that he might be glorified amen
[1:24:28] first Peter 1:7 Bible says the trial of
[1:24:30] your faith
[1:24:31] here we quote it now being much more
[1:24:33] precious than of gold that perishes
[1:24:34] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:24:36] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[1:24:39] the appearing of Jesus Christ whom
[1:24:41] having not seen he loved in whom though
[1:24:43] now you see him not ye believing what
[1:24:46] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[1:24:50] glory oh brother I believe that's as
[1:24:52] much a part of the bride and end time as
[1:24:53] anything else as any other attribute as
[1:24:56] anything else we can say is that joy
[1:24:57] unspeakable and full of glory just
[1:25:00] something that warms your heart
[1:25:01] something that moves you and stirs you
[1:25:02] remember Billy call the revival that
[1:25:04] wind coming on the lake doesn't add one
[1:25:06] drop of water to the lake it just stirs
[1:25:08] up what the lake already has and what
[1:25:10] does it do wash all the trash to the
[1:25:11] sides oh we need that wooden to blow
[1:25:13] don't you don't you think so yes sir
[1:25:16] blow on me Lord
[1:25:19] here's that big one from the smyrnaean
[1:25:21] church agent this thing you know I've
[1:25:23] had to ask the Lord for giving us so
[1:25:25] many times does he love us yes but how
[1:25:28] shall we know we shall know because he
[1:25:30] said so and manifested that he did love
[1:25:34] us for he brought us to himself who gave
[1:25:36] you this truth who gave you an ear to
[1:25:38] hear it now that proves the love of God
[1:25:41] right there gave us of his birth placing
[1:25:45] us as sons he's in how shall I prove my
[1:25:47] love to him he says by believing what he
[1:25:49] said and conducting myself with joy
[1:25:54] we're amidst the trials not after the
[1:25:57] trials amidst the trials that he and his
[1:26:01] wisdom allows to come to pass that's
[1:26:04] hard I'll just be plain honestly that's
[1:26:06] hard because I feel miserable and I want
[1:26:09] to feel miserable and I want everybody
[1:26:11] else to feel sorry for me you know but
[1:26:13] that's not how a son of God or daughter
[1:26:15] God conduct themselves she's a guy who's
[1:26:17] praising God the loudest he's probably
[1:26:19] going through the biggest trial amen
[1:26:23] praise the Lord with joy help me Lord
[1:26:27] true worship that was mentioned at the
[1:26:29] beginning here I believe in true worship
[1:26:30] and that's not just in truth but in
[1:26:32] spirit and truth
[1:26:33] yes sir John 4:23 but the hour cometh he
[1:26:36] says and now is when the true worshipers
[1:26:39] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:26:41] truth and the father seeketh such to
[1:26:42] worship Him God is a spirit and they
[1:26:44] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:26:46] spirit and truth quite often we get so
[1:26:49] full of truth we've become social away
[1:26:50] down by we can't lift our arms anymore
[1:26:54] truth has been restored but truth is a
[1:26:57] person not a whole bunch of rules if
[1:27:01] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[1:27:03] the life
[1:27:05] so it's that what is it it's the
[1:27:06] manifested word that's what Jesus was
[1:27:08] the Word made flesh oh brother that
[1:27:11] brings that that brings the rejoin you
[1:27:12] can't you can't sit still when that
[1:27:14] happens in here you can so without the
[1:27:17] spirit we are bound to miss the moment
[1:27:19] of inspiration night those ten virgins
[1:27:21] right they were virgins they were
[1:27:22] following the word but they missed the
[1:27:24] corner they missed the junction why cuz
[1:27:26] they didn't have a spirit a whole lot of
[1:27:28] truth no spirit
[1:27:30] brother balint like and he said if we
[1:27:31] had a whole bunch of cars over here now
[1:27:33] let's say their raptures and/or heavens
[1:27:34] in Auckland we have perfect car sitting
[1:27:37] out here in the parking lot a whole row
[1:27:38] of them sit without gasoline we're not
[1:27:40] going to get there so as much as we're
[1:27:43] right fundamentally right scripturally
[1:27:44] right all these things we have all the
[1:27:46] perfect conditions they can run just
[1:27:47] fine not a drop of gasoline that's the
[1:27:49] Holy Ghost
[1:27:50] so Holy Ghost is going to get you there
[1:27:52] in that car which is the Word of God
[1:27:55] which is the fundamental doctrines and
[1:27:57] the truth is coming out of here so you
[1:28:00] don't want to hit a wrong note get in
[1:28:01] that place where you're not reflecting
[1:28:02] who he is and that's my prayer tonight
[1:28:04] you know I want to be so in the spirit
[1:28:06] and you know what it takes takes dying
[1:28:07] yeah you say well I died when I got born
[1:28:10] again no no Paul said I die every day so
[1:28:13] he might live you don't get born again
[1:28:15] every day but you have to die through
[1:28:16] this old nature you say Lord you do the
[1:28:18] leading in my life you do the
[1:28:19] inspiration in my life you bring me to
[1:28:21] that place where I'm reflecting the
[1:28:22] right image the right quality that you
[1:28:24] want in this hour not another day but
[1:28:26] right for this day let me reflect
[1:28:28] reflect what you have right here now
[1:28:32] yeah let me skip over that and some yeah
[1:28:35] let's leave that alone I'm gonna take
[1:28:38] let's just move on to completely
[1:28:40] surrendered peace of trumpets and want
[1:28:44] skip I'm not cheating you but I think
[1:28:47] we've made the point already a complete
[1:28:49] surrender this is beautiful and
[1:28:51] spiritual adoption remember that time
[1:28:53] talked about the quarry said you didn't
[1:28:54] choose yourself the Angels chose you
[1:28:57] they picked you out of that quarry and
[1:28:58] the reason they picked you out because
[1:29:00] you had a quality you had something in
[1:29:02] you and you know what it is he said you
[1:29:03] never know there I just read it the
[1:29:05] angel of God one night working the
[1:29:06] quarry called you out and you submitted
[1:29:07] yourself to me and I cut you in my
[1:29:10] fashion because I made you the way that
[1:29:13] I wanted you to be I done the sawing you
[1:29:15] just stood still
[1:29:16] it just takes us a render friends we
[1:29:18] not gonna add one cubit to our stature
[1:29:19] here it takes God's shape and God's
[1:29:22] moving just say Lord be it unto me
[1:29:23] according to thy word just like Mary how
[1:29:25] many how is she going to bring forth the
[1:29:27] Son of God without even knowing a man
[1:29:29] the son of God didn't mind you know any
[1:29:31] son what did what did the angel tell her
[1:29:34] the Holy Ghost will overshadow you how
[1:29:36] will these things be the whole egos
[1:29:38] gonna overshadow you and say well how
[1:29:39] can I take a rapture I can't change this
[1:29:41] body I can't do anything about my
[1:29:42] lifestyle I can't change my desire the
[1:29:44] Holy Ghost will overshadow you the
[1:29:46] answer is always the same friends and
[1:29:48] that same Holy Ghost is right here if
[1:29:50] you have a willing heart and I'd say
[1:29:51] Lord I want to stand still I'll stand
[1:29:52] still and be cut you cut me you shaped
[1:29:55] my life
[1:29:55] you make me in the image you want me to
[1:29:57] be here believe from the heart how do we
[1:30:00] do this since if you can just empty out
[1:30:02] your own intellectual thoughts this
[1:30:04] isn't give God the right away he can
[1:30:06] declare look at this his character
[1:30:09] through the what the work of your
[1:30:12] yielding it's work
[1:30:14] empty out get the world get your doubts
[1:30:18] out of the way so well that means I have
[1:30:21] to kind of clean up my life and then
[1:30:22] come to the Lord no sir uh-uh there's
[1:30:24] somebody here gonna turn on the light
[1:30:25] you can't sweep the darkness out of the
[1:30:28] room you can try all you like take
[1:30:30] somebody to turn the light on and that's
[1:30:32] what God does he turns the light on all
[1:30:34] the darkness just scatters it just moves
[1:30:36] out of the way just yield yourself to
[1:30:37] him he does the sawing he does the
[1:30:39] building he does the working he knows
[1:30:41] what it do here and I know we were kind
[1:30:43] of ooh just the scary thing that's watch
[1:30:46] you're kind of running out of time but I
[1:30:48] want to just underline these few things
[1:30:50] for you before we go now we ought to
[1:30:52] conduct ourselves like sons of the King
[1:30:53] daughters of the king
[1:30:54] especially the worse it gets the more
[1:30:57] the closer the brighter in a rail 56 is
[1:31:03] men and woman we are aliens here on this
[1:31:07] earth aliens with pilgrims and strangers
[1:31:11] our garden our crisis on the other side
[1:31:14] and we are sons and daughters of the
[1:31:15] king we ought to be conducting ourselves
[1:31:17] not in the gambling smoking drinking
[1:31:19] picture shows television programs
[1:31:21] scandal lies carrying on we should
[1:31:23] conduct ourselves as sons and daughters
[1:31:25] of God walking with our heads up living
[1:31:27] in the light of the King yes sir it's
[1:31:30] yours he says if you want it
[1:31:31] how about it it's yours if you believe
[1:31:35] that you have to have it
[1:31:36] don't just slop around just live a
[1:31:38] second grade Christian life don't have
[1:31:41] to if you say well I want it that's all
[1:31:44] it takes tonight just I want it and he
[1:31:47] does the work he does the sawing he does
[1:31:48] the shaping amen it's yours tonight not
[1:31:52] tomorrow the biggest lie the devil can
[1:31:54] tell you is put it off you'll get
[1:31:56] another chance grab the opportunity
[1:31:59] while you head we might not have another
[1:32:00] service what if he comes tonight then
[1:32:04] this is our last chance why would you
[1:32:07] miss it what would you make make you

[1:33:02] day it doesn't take a smart guy doesn't
[1:33:05] take a clever guy it doesn't even take a
[1:33:06] brain because how can animals without an
[1:33:09] understanding come to the ark Noah
[1:33:11] didn't go out and drag him in he didn't
[1:33:14] go preaching the bush somewhere and
[1:33:15] there the animals came God brought them
[1:33:18] how surprised Noah must have been here
[1:33:22] they're coming we've been building all
[1:33:24] these making all these preparations here
[1:33:25] they come they could those animals could
[1:33:28] hear the voice of God what about it what
[1:33:30] about me what about you
[1:33:31] can you hear that peace sake come up
[1:33:34] higher we're getting out of here the
[1:33:37] countdown is on yes sir oh I believe in
[1:33:40] the whole heart you must feel it like
[1:33:43] the veil is getting pretty thin isn't it
[1:33:45] between here and there it's just it's
[1:33:47] all over you you touch the word now and
[1:33:50] it's electricity it's just amazing the
[1:33:53] same things you read 10 years ago all of
[1:33:55] a sudden they're jumping out at you
[1:33:56] because this is the time this is the
[1:33:59] translation hour it's on us amen yes say
[1:34:03] your good-byes if you want to we're
[1:34:05] leaving mm-hmm
[1:34:08] message influence 63 says if I see a man
[1:34:14] walking fine looking young man a few
[1:34:16] years watch his hair turned green slip
[1:34:18] out his shoulders threw down beautiful
[1:34:20] young girl standing with a sainted godly
[1:34:22] face on harassed and praising God and
[1:34:23] come back in a few years and find her
[1:34:25] stoop-shouldered packing two or three
[1:34:26] children well my it shows that in that
[1:34:28] body there's death no matter how well it
[1:34:30] is how lovely it looks it's still got
[1:34:32] death in it is now watch i watch which
[1:34:37] away that spirit in there leans if it's
[1:34:41] always representing the light speaking
[1:34:43] of the light talking of the light it'll
[1:34:44] go with the light it's but if it's
[1:34:46] always on the other side of the world
[1:34:47] the things of the world influenced by
[1:34:49] the world there's nothing but it to turn
[1:34:51] into darkness when it dies into outer
[1:34:53] darkness this is so you see since what
[1:34:56] we are we must remember that we are only
[1:34:58] what we are by the grace of God none of
[1:35:01] us can brag about it we can only bow in
[1:35:03] adoration and humility before God and
[1:35:05] give praise to him for his goodness what
[1:35:07] you are today is only by God's grace and
[1:35:09] here we are this is the Bible calls it
[1:35:12] evens 110 calls it the fullness of time
[1:35:15] in King James in the amplified that's
[1:35:18] not the amplifier that's the King James
[1:35:19] I got that's the mistake in the EM
[1:35:21] amplified I've got the reference there
[1:35:23] to remind me it causes the climax of the
[1:35:25] ages the climax this is what it's all
[1:35:28] been about really so it wasn't what's
[1:35:31] the Calvary the climax to the ages
[1:35:33] Calvary was for now Pentecost was for
[1:35:36] now when death will be abolished death
[1:35:39] will be conquered and they'll walk home
[1:35:41] straight because it shows you the blood
[1:35:43] of the power the power of the blood of
[1:35:45] Calvary that life who was in the blood
[1:35:46] the same spirit raised jesus from DES
[1:35:48] now in us quickening our mortal bodies
[1:35:50] so here we are this is the climax this
[1:35:53] is it brothers no wonder we can feel it
[1:35:58] all things is going to gather all things
[1:36:00] in Christ both which are in heaven those
[1:36:02] are those those already gone on coming
[1:36:04] back to the resurrection and on the
[1:36:06] earth that's us it'll be translated in
[1:36:08] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:36:09] even in him see the discrepancy he says
[1:36:12] so we find the same old solar
[1:36:14] discrepancy and remember that sin was
[1:36:16] never forgiven that's causing adding a
[1:36:18] little thought to God's Word so now
[1:36:20] brother if it was never forgiven then
[1:36:21] what about now says when the real seed
[1:36:23] of all the ages are coming together all
[1:36:29] the ages here it is rather bran says the
[1:36:32] six thousand years I sometimes had the
[1:36:34] idea was just the last two thousand you
[1:36:36] know uh-huh
[1:36:37] six thousand years you're gonna see Adam
[1:36:40] one of these things you're that knock on
[1:36:42] your door sometimes wonder if they'll
[1:36:44] knock oh they'll just come here and give
[1:36:45] you a big fright wouldn't they but
[1:36:48] you'll know who it is
[1:36:49] it's not like they have to introduce
[1:36:50] themselves can you imagine
[1:36:54] do you know how close it is sometimes a
[1:36:57] little while ago is reading revelations
[1:36:58] nineteen seventeen and nineteen there
[1:37:00] were they heavenly oh it's coming down
[1:37:01] to Armageddon and I read it and I
[1:37:02] thought man I'm gonna be there I'm gonna
[1:37:04] see this and it's like you think about a
[1:37:07] birthday or Christmas or something
[1:37:08] coming up it's pretty exciting said oh
[1:37:10] yeah we got to make these plans it
[1:37:11] became that real to me I thought you
[1:37:15] know I can't tell you what excitement is
[1:37:17] it's just way beyond that because that's
[1:37:20] what's lying ahead for you oh I've got
[1:37:22] to go to school to write exams and learn
[1:37:24] math brother your next stop is to have
[1:37:27] any supper that that's where we're going
[1:37:30] Oh doesn't it just make you feel a
[1:37:34] little better
[1:37:36] or a whole lot maybe for like me our
[1:37:39] lives our lives these lives you're
[1:37:41] living right now our testimony so the
[1:37:43] tie posts for this age do you realize
[1:37:44] that you're gonna read that absolute
[1:37:46] message again I'm gonna give you a
[1:37:47] little quote from absolute and I'll hold
[1:37:48] on to your chair okay don't want you're
[1:37:51] going anywhere
[1:37:51] listen to this just really put a
[1:37:56] spiritual thinking cap on now it says in
[1:37:57] the portion of his word that's allotted
[1:37:59] for this day that's the rapture Elijah
[1:38:02] then the days of the voice of the
[1:38:03] seventh angel all those scriptures his
[1:38:06] Holy Spirit is here to manifest that
[1:38:08] portion of word
[1:38:11] now watch it says just like it was back
[1:38:15] there at his birth Isaiah 9:6 all down
[1:38:19] through the scriptures everything was
[1:38:21] spoken of him it was fulfilled right all
[1:38:23] those things that spoke about Jesus when
[1:38:25] he came it happened there he was his
[1:38:28] over in the Book of Luke we see see it
[1:38:31] there it was the a he and he was the end
[1:38:32] he was the end of the prophecy - of him
[1:38:35] they could argue they could debate oh
[1:38:37] and Messiah comes he's gonna come this
[1:38:39] way he's gonna come that way he's gonna
[1:38:40] do this he's gonna do that but when he
[1:38:42] stepped on the scene and did it all that
[1:38:44] was the end of the argument he was the
[1:38:45] interpretation of the word this is what
[1:38:48] God meant when he said those things
[1:38:50] right you know watch this he fulfilled
[1:38:52] that the history the songs everything in
[1:38:55] the Old Testament that spoke of him was
[1:38:56] fulfilled right there that become the
[1:38:59] ultimate what not the words in the book
[1:39:02] the words in flesh the same words
[1:39:05] manifested became the absolute the
[1:39:08] ultimate sunderson
[1:39:08] the Bible is my ultimate you don't know
[1:39:10] what you're talking about the Bible made
[1:39:12] flesh is the ultimate the absolute
[1:39:15] I'm gonna now watch as I say - hold onto
[1:39:16] your chair here we go
[1:39:18] and I'm sure you know where I'm going
[1:39:19] because that became the typos of the
[1:39:22] Word of God for that age mmm-hmm that's
[1:39:25] Jesus wonderful praise the Lord how
[1:39:27] about it and the real born-again people
[1:39:30] of God next paragraph he says of this
[1:39:34] age that's filled with the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:36] the type oast of this scripture that's
[1:39:40] got to be fulfilled in these last days
[1:39:42] they they are the ultimate right in the
[1:39:46] absolute message you can't argue with
[1:39:47] that
[1:39:48] so what does it become not you the word
[1:39:50] manifested in years becomes the ultimate
[1:39:52] for this age oh your dreary little life
[1:39:56] story
[1:39:58] uh-huh the things you've faced the times
[1:40:02] you failed you say what about the
[1:40:03] failures what about Jacob uh-huh but
[1:40:07] when God thought about that age he
[1:40:09] thought about Jacob but not Esau there
[1:40:12] you are brother what God spoke
[1:40:15] concerning you takes on flesh in you
[1:40:18] becomes your daily walk it is God's
[1:40:20] ultimate because it's his word and the
[1:40:21] word is Christ - ty Post there's no way
[1:40:24] to get away from it
[1:40:25] something that holds you something that
[1:40:27] holds you why don't you go with the rest
[1:40:29] of them but Jesus asked the Apostles the
[1:40:31] disciples that day oh I've said things
[1:40:34] you don't understand it's a cloud it's a
[1:40:36] rocket you know don't understand can't
[1:40:38] figure it out there's no scientific
[1:40:40] proof for this they you know with a
[1:40:41] bridge that the incident never happened
[1:40:44] all that stuff why you still here
[1:40:51] because wait where you gonna go
[1:40:55] these are the words of eternal life this
[1:40:59] is God in you manifesting himself can
[1:41:04] you see the supernatural power God you
[1:41:06] know I spoke to my sister she lives on

[1:41:29] God is there her life like she's just
[1:41:31] living in ordering life I asked her you
[1:41:33] still believe the message she's yeah of
[1:41:35] course I said okay there it is there it
[1:41:38] is this is the falling away we're in the
[1:41:40] falling away what's keeping you can you
[1:41:44] read that something that holds you what
[1:41:45] is that the ultimate the absolute for
[1:41:48] this age because you don't keep yourself
[1:41:51] if he doesn't keep you you're gone like
[1:41:53] everybody else so isn't that a proof
[1:41:56] that isn't that a confirmation to you
[1:41:57] tonight that he loves you sure it is
[1:41:58] because he keeps your heart when
[1:42:00] everybody else is turning away he say

[1:42:04] what are you gonna join some other
[1:42:05] church gonna go what what what is out
[1:42:08] there
[1:42:12] praise the Lord I gotta wrap up here Oh
[1:42:15] seed of discrepancy this is too
[1:42:17] beautiful get back in the seat of
[1:42:19] discrepancy now says this he was the
[1:42:20] Word made manifest we saw that he was
[1:42:22] God's interpretation of the word look at
[1:42:24] that he says it out straight out he says
[1:42:26] because he said search the Scriptures
[1:42:28] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:42:29] life and they are they which testify of
[1:42:31] me right there you are he was the
[1:42:34] interpretation of the word and every
[1:42:37] born-again son a daughter of God not
[1:42:39] just him every born-again son and
[1:42:42] daughter of God of this age is the
[1:42:45] interpretation of the word oh my when
[1:42:48] God said those things when he showed the
[1:42:50] vision to John on the Isle of Patmos and
[1:42:51] he wrote it down there and he saw those
[1:42:54] people rejoicing and singing a new song
[1:42:56] what was he seeing you
[1:43:00] you are the Ripon epistles rid of all
[1:43:02] men just what Paul said in the beginning
[1:43:04] you know God is doing the writing here
[1:43:06] not me you might read this letter to the
[1:43:08] Corinthians but there's another letter
[1:43:09] being written oh yeah it's the imprint
[1:43:12] of God on the hearts of people that's
[1:43:13] what's being written this is your our
[1:43:15] that you were born for this no other
[1:43:17] time not no it's time not Jesus time
[1:43:20] right now you were born for a body
[1:43:21] change you were born to believe the
[1:43:23] message you were born to hear that Eagle
[1:43:25] scream you were born to come out of her
[1:43:28] not be partakers of her place further
[1:43:31] Donnie says the word becomes alive in
[1:43:34] our own flesh that shows the presence of
[1:43:37] God whoa
[1:43:39] not the feeling not an anointing but the
[1:43:42] word becoming flesh in you shows the
[1:43:45] presence of God now you can see when you
[1:43:47] get sick then you don't have to run to
[1:43:48] the doctor the first thing you say by
[1:43:51] stripes I'm healed Lord I commit this to
[1:43:53] you and if you lead you to the doctor
[1:43:55] and go to the doctor but the truth of it
[1:43:57] is there's no healing but from the
[1:43:59] doctor life is the healer all healing
[1:44:01] comes from God all healing is divine
[1:44:03] healing doctor gonna only kill that rat
[1:44:07] that invaded but who's gonna fix the
[1:44:09] hole he can't do it he said brother
[1:44:12] Brown said if we could do that we could
[1:44:13] make a man right here if we had that
[1:44:14] kind of a material but we can't make a
[1:44:17] man
[1:44:18] things that are to be in one winding
[1:44:20] down here things that are to be only one
[1:44:23] form of eternal life was God there to be
[1:44:26] a son of God you had to be in him always

[1:44:32] there was even a molecule see and you
[1:44:34] are nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:44:36] gene of life that was in God as a son of

[1:45:50] if you're young or old tonight you want
[1:45:51] to say well I realize that and I want to
[1:45:54] make my decision I want my way with a
[1:45:56] Lourdes biased view I want to there's an
[1:45:58] attraction for me from heaven I don't
[1:46:00] understand it all their understanding is
[1:46:02] never required

[1:46:06] your heart the fade is little tug on
[1:46:08] your heart you say Lord me I'm coming I
[1:46:11] want to be part of that I want to be

[1:46:26] one of these you don't even see the
[1:46:27] kingdom
[1:46:28] praise God it doesn't take intellectual
[1:46:31] Giants understanding all laying it all
[1:46:32] out we saw those they were dressed up in
[1:46:35] Pharisee ropes he said some of these
[1:46:38] glorious days now got there now some of
[1:46:42] these glorious days you'll find out that
[1:46:44] this bunch of power that changes harlots
[1:46:46] to ladies and drunkards to gentlemen
[1:46:48] that presence is the very power that
[1:46:52] will lift them out of this earth and
[1:46:53] take them home in the rapture to glory
[1:46:56] isn't that something that little tuck
[1:46:59] rather vanishes that thing that made you
[1:47:01] certain of the gospel there it is oh
[1:47:04] it's not just the power it's somebody
[1:47:07] somebody it's coming to you and he's
[1:47:11] taking you with him when he leaves the
[1:47:12] earth says what is it since I've walked
[1:47:16] out and looked at that great that great
[1:47:19] morning star she begins to move yonder
[1:47:21] what does the morning star say the
[1:47:23] morning star is only reflecting the
[1:47:24] supreme light of the Sun coming remember
[1:47:26] that it's just the planet out there we
[1:47:28] call the morning star reflecting the Sun
[1:47:30] this is that right the morning star the
[1:47:32] reason it's so bright you know why it is
[1:47:34] the Sun so much closer to it it's
[1:47:36] suppressing on in the morning star hails
[1:47:38] the coming of the son it's alright you
[1:47:40] morning stars it's time to go to hailing
[1:47:42] is coming not just the prophets message
[1:47:44] he your life that message becomes a life
[1:47:47] in you and now you become the life you
[1:47:49] become the voice because it's a voice
[1:47:52] speaking overriding your reasoning and
[1:47:54] your understanding and your feelings and
[1:47:55] your on your nonsense it's overcoming
[1:47:57] all of that and shining outshine the
[1:48:00] morning stars rise early says it says
[1:48:02] the Sun will soon be here which is when
[1:48:05] we look and see that morning star just a
[1:48:08] glistening in the skies and means that
[1:48:10] the Sun will shine pretty soon and when
[1:48:12] we see the morning stars of God rising
