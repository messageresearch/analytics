========================================

[music] Mirales [singing] when you move. Such an easy thing for you to do. Your head is moving [music and singing] right now. You were still showing up at the tomb of every Lazarus. And your voice is calling me out. And right [music and singing] now I know you're able. And right now [music] we're comfortable again. You can [music and singing] do all things. You [music] can do all [singing] things cuz you never [music] lost a [singing] battle. No, you never lost a battle. And I know I know [singing and music] you'll never win. [music] Everything's possible by the power of the Holy [singing] Ghost. A new wind is [music] blowing right now, [singing] breaking my heart of stone, taking [music] over like it's Jericho. And my walls are [music and singing] all crashing down. Right now, I know [music] you're [singing] able. My God, come [music] through again. You can [music and singing] do all things. You can do all [music] [singing] things but fail. Cuz you never lost a battle. No, you never lost a battle. And I know I [singing] know you never will. [music] You never lost a battle. You never lost a battle. You never lost a battle. You never win. [music] You never lost a battle. [singing] You never lost a battle. You never lost a battle. [singing] You never [music] will. Oh, you never lost a battle. [music and singing] You never lost a battle. You never lost a battle. You never will. You never lost a battle. You never lost a battle. &gt;&gt; You never lost a battle. You never win. [music] You [singing] can do all things. [music] You can [singing] do all things [music] but fail. Cuz you never lost a battle. No, you never lost a battle. I know. I [music] know you never will. You can do [singing] all things. [music] You can do all things. [music and singing] Cuz you never lost a battle. No, you never lost a battle.
