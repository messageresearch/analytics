[27:59] you touch each life that's here it's
[28:01] afternoon Lord and Lord you just
[28:02] everyone will be blessed I pray Lord
[28:04] that we'd all lift leave with uplifted
[28:06] uplifted hearts
[28:08] that your holy presence will just steal
[28:10] or Jesus sweep through the building
[28:13] and Lord take all thoughts of the enemy
[28:15] thoughts the devil away thoughts of
[28:16] nervousness and did all Jesus unrest I
[28:18] pray that they'd just be done away with
[28:19] Lord that we could just have peace in
[28:21] your Holy Spirit Lord and be blessed I
[28:23] pray I thank you Lord and the wonderful
[28:25] name of Lord Jesus Christ to pray amen
[28:28] amen always standing if we could just um
[28:31] open open our Bibles to Genesis chapter
[28:34] 1 verse 1 through I would go to verse
[28:37] one
[28:42] and the title I'm going to title this
[28:45] the service the almighty God that we
[28:48] serve amen
[28:50] so if we go to Genesis 1 chapter 1 verse
[28:53] 1 it says here in the beginning God
[28:54] created the Heaven and the Earth and the
[28:57] Earth was without form and void and
[29:00] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[29:04] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[29:06] face of the waters and God said let
[29:09] there be light and there was light amen
[29:12] so our almighty God created the Heaven
[29:14] and the Earth people everything that we
[29:15] see around us all the trees everything
[29:18] there was a God Almighty who created all
[29:20] of it amen I found that so powerful
[29:24] and I was saying to myself that I was
[29:27] like you know I think oh I did a little
[29:28] Garden in order for this to happen I'll
[29:30] need a little bit of a miracle you know
[29:31] or something great like that and then I
[29:35] was there was like a frame of myself
[29:36] when I was a little child and I thought
[29:37] my goodness I got born how incredible
[29:40] what what a miracle that was you know I
[29:42] actually I'm here you know I was I was
[29:44] born I was like right and then if we
[29:46] could turn to um Genesis chapter 2
[29:49] and we'll go to verse seven and it says
[29:51] and the Lord formed the man of the Dust
[29:54] of the ground
[29:55] that's quite powerful I can't I've never
[29:58] seen anybody take up you know to go to
[29:59] Stanford and you like get up things
[30:01] handfuls of sand you know nobody's ever
[30:03] you know God Almighty did that but it
[30:06] turned into somebody you know it turned
[30:07] into you and I am in how powerful
[30:10] I meant man of the Dust of the ground
[30:12] and breathed into his nostrils the
[30:14] Breath of Life
[30:15] and Man became a living soul I mean
[30:18] that's very powerful
[30:21] and then if we could go to Second Peter
[30:24] and we'll go um chapter three
[30:30] foreign
[30:35] Peter
[30:38] chapter three
[30:42] and we'll go to verse 13.
[30:45] and it says here
[30:47] and shall receive the reward of
[30:50] unrighteousness as they that
[30:53] I'm on the right that's what
[30:55] uh
[30:58] second paid off chapter three sorry I'm
[31:00] on chapter two
[31:02] and says here nevertheless we according
[31:04] to his promise look for the new heavens
[31:07] and a new Earth where indwelleth
[31:09] righteousness amen so this the Earth
[31:11] that the Lord created you know at the
[31:13] moment it's not the nicest place to live
[31:14] you know there's wars and rumors of wars
[31:17] and stuff
[31:18] but our great golden Mighty is going to
[31:21] is going to create a new heavens and a
[31:23] new Earth amen amen amen your mouth have
[31:27] your seats
[31:28] now I've I've found that quite powerful
[31:30] you know that our Lord God you know
[31:32] because I sometimes think you know this
[31:34] Earth is just a place of suffering you
[31:35] know I just go to work and you know it's
[31:37] hard for me and I sweat and you know but
[31:40] the Lord is creating a greater place for
[31:43] this amen I like how dad says you know
[31:45] we'll struggle on this and on on this in
[31:47] this Earth but you know there's coming a
[31:48] new heavens and the Earth where we're
[31:49] gonna all rest I mean it's going to be
[31:51] an awesome awesome and awesome place
[31:54] and it's going to be forever you know
[31:56] it's going to be eternity we're never
[31:58] going to leave that awesome place I mean
[32:00] it's never going to stop amen
[32:03] now for a good turn to um John chapter
[32:07] 14.
[32:18] let's go John chapter 14.
[32:20] and we'll go to verse 17.
[32:23] and we now want to talk about you know
[32:25] the god the Lord didn't just make this
[32:27] Earth and just he didn't just make us
[32:29] and leave us here
[32:30] amen he comes and dwells in US I mean
[32:32] he's always with us I mean
[32:35] the Lord God never leaves us and it says
[32:38] here in verse 17 even the spirit of
[32:41] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[32:43] because it Seth him not neither knoweth
[32:45] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[32:48] you and shall be in you
[32:49] aiming how powerful the god of who
[32:51] created everything comes and live in us
[32:53] and we know that in order to for the
[32:55] Lord
[32:56] to come dwell in us we must be filled
[32:58] with the Holy Ghost
[33:00] amen
[33:02] and then once we have filled the holy
[33:03] ghost in the um uh sorry once we
[33:06] baptized we shall receive the Holy Ghost
[33:07] so after we're baptized then the Lord
[33:09] can come and live inside us and we are
[33:11] made into new creatures amen and the
[33:15] Lord Jesus
[33:17] amen but but you know in order for the
[33:19] Lord to come live inside us we can't you
[33:21] know um
[33:23] out we need to we need it's like the
[33:26] lord it's like we're like our our bodies
[33:27] are like a house for the Lord you know
[33:29] once we have the Holy Ghost the Lord can
[33:31] then dwell in us you know who wants to
[33:32] go on to a house that's messy and you
[33:34] know run down and people have thrown
[33:36] their letter everywhere you know it
[33:37] wouldn't be very nice
[33:39] and go to your lounge and there's all
[33:41] that there's no furniture no or
[33:42] something like that you're not wouldn't
[33:43] want to be you know but we need to have
[33:45] a house furnished you know and
[33:47] everything needs to be nice for the Lord
[33:48] you know maybe when he goes to make guys
[33:50] into the kitchen maybe there's food food
[33:52] already made for him you know opens up
[33:54] the pantry and there's all food
[33:56] I mean it needs to be clean
[33:58] so if we go to our first Corinthians
[34:01] we'll go to um chapter three
[34:08] so First Corinthians chapter three
[34:11] and we'll go verse 17.
[34:18] says here if any man defile the temple
[34:20] of God him shall God destroy for the
[34:23] temple of God is Holy which Temple ye
[34:26] are
[34:28] I mean so it just States here you know
[34:30] God the Lord doesn't like a temple
[34:32] that's been all you know littered upon
[34:34] you know maybe you know that's been been
[34:36] run down amen we need to look after
[34:38] ourselves I mean we need to morning and
[34:39] night we should well this is just for me
[34:41] you know I need to pray and read my
[34:43] Bible
[34:44] you know and we should always be
[34:46] feasting on the Lord to make our temples
[34:48] you know more holy be filled with more
[34:50] of the Lord
[34:52] amen
[34:55] and I was thinking um
[34:58] I mean even myself you know I was um you
[35:01] know I wasn't probably wasn't then I was
[35:03] definitely a very messy house for the
[35:05] Lord at one stage you know but then
[35:08] been thousand hours I'm I remember I was
[35:11] I wasn't I was on this fan and I was it
[35:13] was night time and I was sitting there
[35:15] and then the Lord told me you know play
[35:16] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and I
[35:19] was like oh yes and then I started
[35:20] playing it
[35:21] and in My Hope because you know I
[35:23] thought I was going to hell at that
[35:25] stage you know and then um
[35:27] started playing Amazing Grace How Sweet
[35:28] the Sound and then the Lord just came
[35:30] and met me in the van and I was like
[35:32] that I was changed I could see things
[35:34] properly and everything changed for me I
[35:36] mean
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] I mean and you know now the Lord lives
[35:40] inside me so the very same Lord Jesus
[35:42] who died on the cross now lives inside
[35:43] of me and then he came and changed
[35:46] changed my life around I mean
[35:49] I thought you know how powerful when I
[35:51] was I mean when I was a little boy I'd
[35:52] always used to ask the Lord deal of God
[35:53] please you know please come film with
[35:55] the Holy Ghost
[35:56] and I believe we know at that stage of
[35:58] fight if I died I would have probably
[36:00] Gone to Heaven because you know my life
[36:02] was my life was right you know I was
[36:03] doing anything right but then you know I
[36:04] didn't feel any different I thought oh
[36:06] my
[36:07] but I have to look back I think you know
[36:09] I wonder if the Lord took me through all
[36:10] that stuff just so I could be filled the
[36:12] Holy Ghost just so he could answer you
[36:14] know the the longing that I was that I
[36:16] was
[36:17] you know wanting and I just think I'm so
[36:20] thankful of the Lord that when the new
[36:21] heavens and youth come I'll be there
[36:23] amen you're going to see David Lee
[36:25] walking the streets of gold event
[36:26] shouting glory amen glory to God Amen
[36:30] now you know the law doesn't just come
[36:32] and um
[36:34] doesn't just come live in us the Lord
[36:36] leads us amen we we are LED we are LED
[36:40] of the Lord now you know we look at the
[36:41] prophet um brother Branham you know he
[36:43] got he he was very LED of the Lord
[36:46] like um someone was saying oh I think
[36:49] it's he he was um
[36:52] he was going he was going to go um B he
[36:55] just want to go live in the wilderness
[36:56] and go hunting and stuff and then
[36:58] the Lord I think the Lord showed him
[37:00] there were two people two two people on
[37:02] the street and they they were very broke
[37:04] just living you know I don't think that
[37:05] I think they might have been homeless
[37:06] and the Lord said you know if you go and
[37:08] do and go up in the wilderness I'll make
[37:11] you like these people amen by that you
[37:13] know the Lord you know the Lord let him
[37:15] the Lord showed him those things so that
[37:17] he wouldn't go and do that you know so
[37:19] he would stay ministering the word he
[37:20] went over to Africa you know who just
[37:22] goes over to Africa you know doesn't you
[37:25] know it's not a very nice place from
[37:26] what to say I could say you know you
[37:28] could go get killed and stuff oh my
[37:29] goodness you know I'd rather stay in
[37:31] America in a nice in a nice place you
[37:33] know nice nice food
[37:35] I mean but you know he went over to
[37:37] Africa and started ministering under
[37:39] people that you know that's that's the
[37:41] Lord leading someone I believe
[37:46] I mean even me you know I used to smoke
[37:48] and drink and do all this evilness you
[37:49] know the Lord led me away from those
[37:51] things
[37:53] but you know the Lord you know and but
[37:56] you know the law can lead in the in the
[37:58] big
[37:58] things and the Lord can also lead in the
[38:00] small things
[38:02] I have a little little bit of testimony
[38:04] I was um
[38:05] I went down to the beach one day and the
[38:07] work van and you know the work Van's
[38:09] only rear wheel drive so I can get stuck
[38:10] quite easily anyway as I was driving
[38:11] down I lost the track oh no I'll go to
[38:14] the side there was like this little side
[38:15] route so I went around there and then I
[38:16] got stuck in the work van on the beach
[38:18] oh my
[38:20] I was like oh it's all right because
[38:22] there's there was a truck parked up and
[38:24] I was like oh so right you know there's
[38:25] a full drive I'll just quickly hop out
[38:26] of my van and go ask this guy
[38:28] and I don't really want to I was like
[38:30] now I'll just have to go to it so I went
[38:32] went up and I got within 50 meters of
[38:33] the sky and then this voice told me to
[38:36] not go back and go back to your van and
[38:37] sudden I thought you know this is this
[38:39] is going Beyond logic you know I should
[38:41] just go quickly ask this guy to tow me
[38:43] out and then I'm gone you know and I got
[38:44] 50 meters he could probably see me walk
[38:45] up to the van I was like oh no so I just
[38:48] turned around and walked back to my van
[38:49] and Hopton and about two months later I
[38:52] thought that was the weirdest thing
[38:53] we've done now I want to hop back out
[38:55] and quickly go go get him and then the
[38:56] first time again he said nope stay here
[38:58] and he I don't he the voice said I don't
[39:01] care if you stay here till midnight stay
[39:02] here because I have a phone to me I
[39:03] couldn't ring you why not I was like I'm
[39:05] just gonna sudden you know Ponder upon
[39:07] the thoughts of the Lord until midnight
[39:08] and
[39:10] um
[39:10] and then anyways about probably about
[39:13] five minutes later
[39:14] there was a truck come past and he was
[39:17] Towing someone so someone else had got
[39:18] stuck and he was tying him out I said oh
[39:20] you know this guy's got a toe rope and
[39:22] the truck I'll just he's going to come
[39:23] past me I'll just quickly go stop him
[39:26] before he drives on so I hopped out and
[39:28] he came past excuse me I I'm I got stuck
[39:30] he's like oh no quick I'll just unhook
[39:32] this guy and then I'll come pull you out
[39:34] oh thanks man you know I'm out of here
[39:36] five minutes later you know thank you
[39:37] Lord anyway so you unhook me
[39:40] he was going to tell me he's like yeah
[39:42] um yeah a lot of people getting stuck
[39:43] today
[39:44] um I've just got this follow-out and
[39:45] then someone's gonna have to go get that
[39:46] fellow out too and it was the dude I was
[39:48] walking up to he was actually stuck I
[39:50] mean so yeah if I walked out from God I
[39:52] wouldn't have gotten too much help so
[39:54] yeah
[40:00] in our Bibles
[40:02] we'll just go to First Kings
[40:15] and First Kings chapter 18.
[40:18] and we will go verse one
[40:21] and it says here and it came to pass
[40:23] after many days
[40:25] that the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[40:27] on the third year saying go show thyself
[40:30] unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the
[40:33] Earth
[40:34] and then if we go down to verse 4
[40:37] it was so that when Jezebel cut off the
[40:40] prophets of the Lord the Obadiah took a
[40:42] hundred and hundred profits and hid them
[40:45] buy 50 in a cave and fed them with bread
[40:48] and water and Ahab said answer Obadiah
[40:51] go into the land
[40:53] unto all Fountains of water unto all
[40:56] Brock's pre-adventure we might find
[40:58] grass to save the horses and mules alive
[41:01] that we lose not all the beasts amen so
[41:04] what's happened here is
[41:05] as this this was a season of drought and
[41:08] we all know
[41:10] um I trust we will read through kings
[41:11] that what what's what's happened is
[41:13] Elijah's Elijah said there was going to
[41:15] be a famine
[41:17] amen so now now Ahab as as you know he's
[41:21] king of Israel and there's a big family
[41:22] in the land amen so I have probably
[41:24] wouldn't be too happy you know because
[41:26] and and he probably wouldn't be too
[41:27] happy at Elijah either because Elijah
[41:29] said there was going to be a a famine
[41:31] and um and also
[41:34] Jezebel was killing all the prophets
[41:36] amen and Elijah was a prophet so the
[41:38] Lord is telling Elijah go to Ahab you
[41:41] know even and if Elijah if Elijah looked
[41:44] at that with his logic he might have
[41:46] thought I'm going to go die you know
[41:49] and men end up you know if that was a
[41:51] worldly person I believe they would have
[41:52] thought I know I'm going to go die I
[41:54] want to go do something else you know
[41:55] but the Lord told Elijah you must go
[41:57] there
[41:59] and if we could go to chapter sorry
[42:02] verse 15.
[42:03] it says here and um so so now Obadiah
[42:07] has come to Elijah
[42:10] and his Elijah has told Obadiah I need
[42:13] you to go to Ahab before before me and
[42:15] tell him
[42:16] that I'm going to go see him
[42:20] I mean and and CeCe here and Elijah said
[42:23] as the Lord of host Lilith before whom I
[42:26] stand I will surely show myself unto him
[42:29] that day and so Obadiah went to meet
[42:33] Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet
[42:36] Elijah and it came to pass when Ahab saw
[42:40] Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou
[42:43] he that troubleth Israel
[42:46] I mean so Ahab wasn't even very happy
[42:48] amen but Elijah still went Elijah still
[42:51] went to Ahab I mean even though he could
[42:53] have died he'd still win I mean so I
[42:55] thought that you know what what an
[42:56] example for me you know he's a man who's
[42:58] about to die and we all know how Elijah
[43:01] died he did not die amen he the Chariots
[43:04] of Fire took Elijah away I mean so I
[43:06] think for myself you know if the Lord
[43:08] tells me to do something I must do it
[43:10] you know
[43:11] I mean
[43:12] but I thought you know how how powerful
[43:14] and then if we could turn go to Jonah
[43:16] chapter one
[43:23] so if we could go to Jonah I trust me on
[43:26] another story I'm just going to read
[43:27] these verses quickly now the word of the
[43:29] Lord came unto Jonah the son of am matai
[43:33] saying arise go to none of that great
[43:35] City
[43:37] and cry against it for their wickedness
[43:39] has come up before me but Jonah arose up
[43:42] to flea and tutashus from the presence
[43:45] of the Lord and went down to Joppa and
[43:48] he found a ship going to tarshish
[43:51] so he paid the fear thereof
[43:53] and went down into it
[43:56] to go up with them in tutashus from the
[43:58] presence of the Lord now I found the
[44:00] story very interesting because you know
[44:02] it's I almost feel like there'll be a
[44:04] question of you know how do I know that
[44:06] the Lord's talking to me or how do I
[44:07] know where the Lord's going to lead me I
[44:09] mean well I look at the story of Jonah I
[44:11] think to myself I don't think Jonah
[44:12] could help but be led by the Lord and
[44:15] when he tried to go he tried to go go
[44:17] somewhere else and still and we if we
[44:19] read on the story we'll find that you
[44:20] know Jonah got swallowed up by a big
[44:22] fish
[44:23] so Jonah actually couldn't go anywhere
[44:24] amen the Lord so you know we shouldn't
[44:27] question oh dear Lord you know well you
[44:29] can um the Lord can
[44:32] um how do I know where to go amen but if
[44:35] the Lord really wants you to do
[44:36] something I believe you'll end up doing
[44:38] it at the end of the day you will
[44:40] fulfill that you know if the Lord really
[44:42] wants to adore you it's you know like
[44:43] you'll be like Jonah who couldn't help
[44:45] but be led
[44:47] amen but you know in order to be led by
[44:50] the law in a deeper way you know we must
[44:52] die to ourselves daily we must die to
[44:53] the our flesh daily you know to have a
[44:56] have a closer walk with the Lord so the
[44:57] Lord can have more of a pool so we can
[44:59] you know enter into the Lord's presence
[45:01] more and that voice that the Lord's
[45:03] voice will become clearer amen that can
[45:05] you know because you know I like how I
[45:08] think this brother man keeps saying you
[45:09] know we shouldn't always be watching
[45:10] YouTube I mean don't always be hearing
[45:12] YouTube's voice because it might drown
[45:14] out the voice of the Lord eventually you
[45:15] know if you keep watching it too much
[45:16] there's a nice balance you know you'd
[45:18] learn quite a few handful things on
[45:20] YouTube but you can't you know always
[45:21] listen to YouTube
[45:23] I mean you want to hear the that that
[45:25] sweet that sweet voice of the Lord
[45:28] amen
[45:30] and now I want to go to Romans we're
[45:32] going to turn on Bible to Romans chapter
[45:33] six
[45:46] so go Romans chapter six and we'll go to
[45:48] verse 23.
[45:50] it says here for the wages of sin is
[45:53] death but the gift of God is eternal
[45:56] life through Jesus Christ
[45:58] amen so just just to just to finish here
[46:02] on you know we have eternal life I'm in
[46:05] the I was read this again for the wages
[46:07] of sun is death but the gift of God is
[46:09] eternal life you know there's Assad
[46:10] space it's like there's two choices to
[46:12] choose from you could choose the wages
[46:14] of death which is
[46:15] um sin but you'll you'll die or you
[46:18] could choose the gift of God's eternal
[46:20] life you know but you know you must die
[46:21] to yourself daily I mean
[46:23] you must live in the ways of the Lord
[46:25] but I'll sing to myself you know I was
[46:27] thinking oh you know I wonder who I'm
[46:29] going to see up there in eternity and
[46:31] you know I remember um I think it was
[46:33] you know brother Andy's sister Ron you
[46:35] know they had um I think when their
[46:36] first child was you know had a fatal
[46:38] that had a fatal death you know but I
[46:40] believe you know we're going to see her
[46:41] up in glory because sister Brahman had a
[46:43] dream Angie saw she saw um here off in
[46:46] glory I mean so how cool is that gonna
[46:48] be okay amen and then I was you know we
[46:51] all um we all know that um brother
[46:53] Branham he went beyond the curtain of
[46:54] time and he saw I think he saw um his
[46:58] wife hope and his his daughter
[47:02] and you know um and he said we cannot
[47:04] miss it we have to be there amen so you
[47:07] know even if there's like you know I
[47:08] find myself often you know this life is
[47:10] a struggle you know I knew the desires
[47:12] of the flesh can pull you one way but
[47:13] you know you have to be there so even if
[47:15] your desires or your flesh try to grab
[47:17] you I mean you must be an eternity I
[47:19] mean you know
[47:20] I mean and you know I was also I was
[47:23] also thinking um my grandpa he died a
[47:26] while ago when I think I was about seven
[47:28] and we were back in Gisborne and Mum was
[47:30] you know she wasn't very happy she said
[47:32] oh my you know my grandpa's dead we
[47:34] didn't go to the the funeral or anything
[47:35] so you know I don't I don't really know
[47:37] what happened but I hope that he's going
[47:39] to be up there in glory too
[47:40] amen and my mum we used to go to like
[47:43] pack and save and go shopping and go
[47:44] shopping with her and I remember her
[47:46] telling one of the the people who was on
[47:48] the tellers this lady she's like
[47:50] um when I get to heaven I know I believe
[47:52] my Grandpa's gonna my dad is going to
[47:54] come back from the dead oh my you know
[47:56] is that something here every day I mean
[47:58] but but you know and I was thinking to
[48:01] myself I thought oh my if grandpa has
[48:03] has gone into eternity he might come
[48:04] back with the Saints amen so he might
[48:06] actually come back mum you know how
[48:08] that'd be awesome so grandpargan I mean
[48:12] and and just just one thing as I as I
[48:14] close that actually it was by the
[48:15] brother brother Chris Gershon told me I
[48:16] found it quite powerful for myself it
[48:18] says I he this is why she said to me he
[48:21] said um because I I was questioning a
[48:24] couple things and he said you should
[48:25] always be growing in the Lord
[48:28] you know and you should never you should
[48:30] he said you should never just as you
[48:32] grow you know you come to points where
[48:33] you just Plateau along and you know you
[48:35] get a bit lazy and you know if you're if
[48:38] you're you're diligently seeking the
[48:40] Lord you know it's all it's very good
[48:41] too you know but he said you must just
[48:43] always ground the Lord if you find
[48:45] yourself come to a point where you're
[48:46] just plateauing along and you'll walk
[48:48] with the Lord he said start going
[48:49] upwards again you know and I found that
[48:51] quite powerful I was like oh my yes

[51:04] God bless you praise the Lord amen
[51:08] hallelujah amen all right let's turn to
[51:11] Proverbs Chapter 3. so I've got a few
[51:12] questions to um
[51:14] that I got sent through so I'm just
[51:16] going to go through them and if I don't
[51:17] make it through all of them or we'll
[51:19] just pick up another time
[51:21] um but as always you know I'm sorry I
[51:23] haven't given them the
[51:25] uh you know every question is a very
[51:28] good question and probably deserves a
[51:29] lot more of an answer and things but
[51:31] um yeah we can always pick these things
[51:33] up
[51:34] um so Proverbs three and five and and
[51:36] we'll read verse seven as well just uh
[51:39] amen so it says here in Proverbs 3
[51:41] verses five to seven it says trust in
[51:44] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[51:45] not unto thine own understanding and all
[51:48] thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall
[51:50] direct thy paths be not wise in thy own
[51:52] eyes fear the lord and apart from evil
[51:56] hey malicious about our heads in a word
[51:57] of prayer thank you Lord Jesus truly uh
[52:00] What a Mighty God you are Lord you
[52:02] creator of heavens and earth Lord you're
[52:04] so awesome and we thank you we can
[52:06] gather this afternoon just pray your
[52:07] blessings upon the word oh God these
[52:09] questions as well we thank you in Jesus
[52:10] Christ's name take the service into your
[52:12] control For Your Glory we ask in Jesus
[52:14] Christ's name amen amen God bless you so
[52:17] you can have your seats so I've got a
[52:19] few this is not an e particular order
[52:21] so um I want to start with this the
[52:24] first one is the best advice for young
[52:25] people in this day and age well I think
[52:29] the best thing is uh make sure you know
[52:31] the Lord above everything if you know
[52:33] him you'll be successful in life you
[52:35] know just so
[52:37] make sure you know him and everything
[52:39] and as I read there in Proverbs 3 you
[52:42] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[52:44] lean not to thy own understanding and
[52:45] acknowledge Him in all and in all thy
[52:48] ways acknowledge Him so in everything
[52:49] you're going to do in life acknowledge
[52:50] Him and he'll direct your paths right
[52:52] and you know I think it's such a
[52:54] fundamental thing and also don't don't
[52:58] wander through life aimlessly have a
[53:00] goal have a desire to better yourself
[53:03] you know have you know I think life
[53:06] goals are good to have you know so I
[53:08] mean be flexible the law can guide you
[53:10] right if you acknowledge Him in all your
[53:11] ways he'll direct your paths okay and
[53:13] also the question really should be is
[53:15] who do you want to be in five years
[53:17] because of the decisions you make now
[53:19] will make you the person you are in five
[53:20] years time so so normally people say
[53:23] what do you want to be doing it's a fair
[53:25] enough question but who do you want to
[53:26] be do you want to be more sincere do you
[53:28] want to be more honest you want to have
[53:29] more Integrity do you want to you know
[53:31] be more loving and kind and
[53:33] understanding and patient do you want to
[53:34] be that kind of a person you know so you
[53:36] should really look um yeah but but you
[53:39] should you know we shouldn't just
[53:41] aimlessly go through life we should have
[53:42] a goal say well one day when I grow up I
[53:44] want to be a you know I want to have
[53:46] this kind of marriage I want to have
[53:48] this kind of home I want to have this
[53:49] kind of you know we should have that
[53:50] kind of you know goals in life
[53:53] because there's such a big net in this
[53:54] day if we go to uh habakkuk chapter one
[53:57] I'm gonna read verses 14 to 17. it's
[54:00] such a big web brother Ram talked about
[54:02] the web of fashion different things
[54:03] people get caught into these things but
[54:06] there's also another net and we know
[54:08] this is no stretch of the imagination
[54:09] when you know the reason why it's called
[54:11] the internet you know it's a net
[54:13] but it's designed to catch people catch
[54:16] your imagination and your and your
[54:17] thoughts and everything you are so have
[54:19] a cook uh 1 and 14 now just like
[54:21] anything with technology there's nothing
[54:23] wrong with the piece of technology it's
[54:24] how you use it so for example like
[54:26] YouTube there's nothing wrong with
[54:27] YouTube it's what you watch on YouTube
[54:29] right so so happy cook 1 and 14th is and
[54:33] maketh men as the Fishers of the sea as
[54:36] the creeping things that have no ruler
[54:38] over them they take up all of them with
[54:41] the angle they catch them in their net
[54:43] and gather them in their drag therefore
[54:45] they rejoice and are glad therefore they
[54:48] sacrifice under their net and burn
[54:49] incense under their drag because by them
[54:52] their portion is fat and their meat
[54:54] plenteous shall they therefore empty
[54:57] their net and not spare continually to
[54:59] slay the Nations now there's more than
[55:02] one way to kill a people you can
[55:03] physically kill people but then you can
[55:04] entrap their minds and that's what the
[55:07] you know the reason things are popular
[55:09] is because they're addictive you know
[55:11] marketing a different thing they um you
[55:13] know I think is a term called like brain
[55:15] hacking where like entertainment they
[55:17] actually have ways of how how to hack
[55:19] someone's brain so they get addicted to
[55:21] things so don't be caught up in the
[55:23] wrong kind of things you know you've got
[55:24] to be you know we really need Holy Ghost
[55:26] leadership when it comes to every part
[55:27] of our life but don't be caught up in
[55:30] the in cyberspace you know we went to
[55:32] live down here right sure use computers
[55:35] use technology but don't don't let it
[55:37] rule you remember these tools are for
[55:40] you not for you to be a tool for it yes
[55:42] so I think it's very important so I
[55:43] because especially when you know there's
[55:46] so much you're in this day and age
[55:47] there's a people have a internet kind of
[55:50] identity and it's been proven that
[55:52] people will argue and fasten things on
[55:54] on social media way differently than
[55:56] they'd sit down and talk to the person
[55:58] so they have one Persona on the web and
[56:00] the other persona in real life we should
[56:01] have one Persona not two right so we
[56:04] shouldn't so we should be the same
[56:05] person here as we are on the internet as
[56:08] we are at school or at work whatever we
[56:10] should be the same person
[56:12] so let's not be caught up in I'm just so
[56:14] I'm just going over this very briefly
[56:15] but these are things to avoid use them
[56:19] for your benefit but don't be dragged
[56:21] caught up into it you know like social
[56:23] media and the internet different things
[56:24] because people just give their whole
[56:26] life to living in cyberspace but they
[56:28] have no real reality of you know so
[56:32] don't be slaying in that net
[56:34] you know God's God's made a knife of his
[56:36] word to chop Us free so um yeah but I
[56:40] think the main thing is if you know him
[56:42] know him above everything
[56:44] and you'll be successful brother bear
[56:47] says give me a housewife give me a
[56:48] farmer give me a preacher a factory
[56:50] worker that'll put God first in
[56:51] everything and that person will be
[56:53] successful in spite of what the devil
[56:54] can do to them so put them first in
[56:56] everything oh I said Lord would this be
[56:59] pleasing for you this is my decision
[57:00] that I want to go I'd know study this or
[57:03] I'd know whatever it may be but put him
[57:05] first and he'll direct your paths
[57:08] now uh the next question now all of
[57:10] these questions I could spend a lot
[57:12] longer on so forgive me if some are
[57:13] shorter and longer answers different
[57:15] things but big question is how do you
[57:17] know you have the Holy Ghost I think
[57:19] brother Dave praise the Lord I'm so glad
[57:21] you shared that testimony there that's
[57:22] powerful that's so awesome so now I'm
[57:25] going to go through a few things first
[57:27] first brother Bram says and I believe
[57:29] that you must have an experience that
[57:31] changes your life changes your heart
[57:32] okay so I'm just going to read a few
[57:34] quotes but
[57:36] um so but this is not my whole answer
[57:38] okay so I'm going to give the whole
[57:39] thing because we get into a stage where
[57:40] we think well is my experience big
[57:42] enough
[57:43] you know because someone else had this
[57:44] amazing experience in a van but I've
[57:46] just you know given my life and here I
[57:48] am you know is is and but we shouldn't
[57:50] we should never get caught up in that
[57:52] kind of thinking we should think has my
[57:54] life changed you know so everyone's
[57:56] experience would be different but has
[57:57] our life changed right and we'll go into
[57:59] what that change is so because like
[58:01] Brother Band see is an invisible union
[58:02] he says now he says he says
[58:06] the modern Church don't want none of
[58:08] them screaming hollering blabbering acts
[58:10] 238 miserable creatures she thinks they
[58:12] are it would certainly embarrass her it
[58:14] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[58:15] scientific Society Church that she
[58:18] belonged to here they would throw her
[58:20] out at the next Council she can't have
[58:21] it so she don't want to be impregnated
[58:23] with the word because it's the only kind
[58:25] the word can bring forth talking about
[58:26] babies born of the spirit of God it has
[58:28] to be the spirit of God in it no
[58:30] intellectual Church joining Creed going
[58:32] bobbed head painted face no such a thing
[58:34] as that and all that you don't find that
[58:36] in the word of God you find an
[58:38] old-fashioned Sanctified holy
[58:40] ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[58:42] God screaming hollering shouting and
[58:44] praising God
[58:45] so we look in the book of Acts when
[58:46] people receive the Holy Ghost did
[58:48] something happen to them right they
[58:50] didn't just accept it by faith and that
[58:51] was it they did accept it by faith but
[58:53] then God confirmed their faith by giving
[58:54] them the Holy Ghost so there's a
[58:56] definite see he says he says many places
[58:58] he says you know a birth is a mess a
[59:01] natural birth doesn't matter if it's in
[59:03] a it's in a palace or a pig pen or a
[59:05] hospital room any birth is a mess he
[59:08] says in the New Birth is the same thing
[59:09] it's a mess but it comes life out of
[59:12] that mess so so life is produced out of
[59:14] whatever that experience is only the way
[59:16] you can receive life is through a birth
[59:18] it's messy but it makes life people try
[59:21] to dodge it see some births are very
[59:23] simple and straightforward others are
[59:24] very complicated naturally speaking and
[59:26] it can be the same thing with a with a
[59:28] spiritual birth they can be either a big
[59:30] thing happen or a small thing but it's
[59:32] the life that's lived afterwards is the
[59:34] is the main thing see see all of our
[59:37] experiences can be different and
[59:38] everyone has different experiences
[59:39] because God is not a cookie cutter right
[59:42] he doesn't give us all the same
[59:43] testimony God deals and changes our
[59:45] lives and different ways so we should
[59:47] never get caught up in a trap to say I
[59:49] wonder if my experience is big enough
[59:51] but the main question we should be
[59:53] asking is what life did I once live and
[59:56] what do I live now after whatever
[59:58] happened to me because the Apostle Paul
[1:00:00] would say in Galatians 2 and 20 says I'm
[1:00:02] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:00:04] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:00:06] and the life which I now live in the
[1:00:09] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:00:11] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:00:13] so he sang the life I now live so he's
[1:00:15] saying I used to live a different kind
[1:00:16] of life but I'm different now
[1:00:19] amen now brother Brown spends um for
[1:00:22] some reason it's it's it's recorded but
[1:00:24] he has this interview with his sister
[1:00:25] Bruce and it's uh he has a private
[1:00:27] interview but it's recorded I don't know
[1:00:28] how that worked but it worked so if you
[1:00:31] go look through the message sister Bruce
[1:00:33] has been part of like she comes like
[1:00:35] she's actually in quite a few sermons
[1:00:36] that brother bear mentions and she comes
[1:00:38] to the altar fairly I know in the 50s
[1:00:41] and then you know she gets healed and
[1:00:42] God prays for I mean brother Brown prays
[1:00:44] for her she gets healed and God's
[1:00:45] working in her life but she comes to
[1:00:48] um it's an it's a 1964 she's wondering
[1:00:51] this is I think at least 10 years she's
[1:00:54] been a Christian and she and she has
[1:00:55] this interview with brother Branham
[1:00:56] because she's looking that the prophet
[1:00:58] will reveal something in her life to to
[1:01:01] to say that's when you receive the holy
[1:01:03] ghost or does she even have it she needs
[1:01:05] to know so she so she's a sincere
[1:01:07] Christian she's been walking with the
[1:01:09] Lord however many years but she but she
[1:01:11] needs to know that she has the Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost I think this is one of the biggest
[1:01:14] questions that many people have is do I
[1:01:16] really know him because if we do know we
[1:01:19] know him we can stand on that say Lord
[1:01:21] you met me and you didn't you didn't
[1:01:23] meet me to leave me but you met me to
[1:01:25] kept me keep keep me right so you know
[1:01:28] so he says now
[1:01:31] um
[1:01:32] um so he says no I visit you in the
[1:01:33] hospital that time so he's talking about
[1:01:35] in um in the past I prayed constantly
[1:01:37] God wouldn't let you die because you're
[1:01:38] a value to the church now I know you I
[1:01:41] know you're going to be all right sister
[1:01:42] Bruce I believe that with all my heart
[1:01:44] see so so she's an asset to the church
[1:01:46] she's valued to the church so she was
[1:01:48] part of the body right and sister Bruce
[1:01:51] is brother Baron most of all I want the
[1:01:52] experience that I have been sealed in
[1:01:54] the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it
[1:01:56] to your hearts this is a question you
[1:01:58] can hear it on tape she wants to know I
[1:02:00] want that experience now she's thinking
[1:02:02] she doesn't have that experience and the
[1:02:04] enemy can twist our thinking round to to
[1:02:06] to get us to even think are we even
[1:02:08] saved are we even Christians you know we
[1:02:10] even you know we're being walking with
[1:02:11] the Lord how like however many years but
[1:02:13] do I even know him
[1:02:15] is it just me he does that too because
[1:02:17] he does that to me constantly
[1:02:19] and um now he says I believe with all my
[1:02:22] heart that you're a real Born Again
[1:02:23] believer sister Bruce how could that
[1:02:24] Spirit just leave when you get sick you
[1:02:27] get weary and you're a nervous type of
[1:02:28] person sister Bruce says yes and you get
[1:02:31] things on your mind little buddy things
[1:02:33] they just keep building up both ways
[1:02:34] you'll get somebody on your heart and
[1:02:36] you want to pray for them and get up and
[1:02:38] pray for it you can't rest until until
[1:02:40] that person's prayed for that's you so
[1:02:42] that's how God worked in her life she
[1:02:43] was built that way she had a burden for
[1:02:45] prayer and God answered her prayers and
[1:02:47] he says Satan works the other side he
[1:02:50] might present you something out this way
[1:02:52] see God see you've got a nature God
[1:02:55] works and Satan works then when Satan
[1:02:57] tries to make you believe that you're
[1:02:58] not see you keep building this and maybe
[1:03:00] this and this see don't look at yourself
[1:03:02] sister Bruce so she got so the devil
[1:03:04] would work in her life using her own
[1:03:06] nature that God gave her against her and
[1:03:09] and getting her to you know think on
[1:03:10] things and build up thoughts about it is
[1:03:12] she even a Christian and different
[1:03:13] things but but brother Brown tells it
[1:03:16] don't look at yourself you look at the
[1:03:17] wrong person you should look at the lamb
[1:03:19] he says I'm now fixing to pray for you
[1:03:21] I'm not worthy to do that I think what
[1:03:23] would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting
[1:03:25] here what would he do if he was sitting
[1:03:27] here he'd lay his hands upon you with
[1:03:29] his great faith he'd see see you'd get
[1:03:31] well well I think well I'm just a sinner
[1:03:33] I'm not because but I come to represent
[1:03:36] him but remember me being a sinner and
[1:03:38] before God I'm not a sinner neither are
[1:03:40] you we've got a blood sacrifice laying
[1:03:42] there God don't even see us he hears our
[1:03:44] voice but he sees the blood of Christ
[1:03:46] that's it see he sees the blood of his
[1:03:48] own son it's our voice Christ's blood
[1:03:50] then it's Christ that's talking through
[1:03:53] us to God so therefore we're not Sinners
[1:03:56] no more we are Christian I believe you
[1:03:58] to be a genuine Christian woman
[1:04:00] but then but then she says but I make so
[1:04:03] many mistakes and he says that's why
[1:04:05] Christ had to die so that you with your
[1:04:07] mistakes won't be lauded to you see he
[1:04:09] took your mistakes your desire and your
[1:04:12] heart is to serve him she says yes all
[1:04:14] right that's what he died for so you
[1:04:16] could serve him see your mistakes are
[1:04:18] not looked not lighted to you see here's
[1:04:20] your propitiation see he's your sin
[1:04:22] offering your sins are not known you're
[1:04:24] not a sinner before God Christ took your
[1:04:26] sins and became you because your desire
[1:04:29] is to serve him but then she says but I
[1:04:31] never had an experience that I've been
[1:04:33] filled with the Holy Ghost that I could
[1:04:34] put my foot on that's her words and and
[1:04:36] so brother and says all right notice
[1:04:38] this ordinarily a human being is born in
[1:04:40] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:04:42] speaking lies that's the nature of a
[1:04:44] human being sister Bruce is yes see that
[1:04:47] was your nature that changed once but
[1:04:50] what changed it and and she says Christ
[1:04:52] and he says there you are sister see
[1:04:54] that's it he that heareth my words and
[1:04:57] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:04:58] eternal life and shall not come to the
[1:05:00] Judgment but uh but hath past tense past
[1:05:02] from Death to life at Saint John 5 24
[1:05:05] Jesus speaking see he says see you're a
[1:05:08] Christian sister Bruce I've watched your
[1:05:09] life I've watched you on Division I know
[1:05:11] you're a Christian so so she was saying
[1:05:13] I need to know the experience I've got
[1:05:15] the Holy Ghost and brother man put it
[1:05:17] down to one day she was she she's
[1:05:19] walking this way away from God doing her
[1:05:20] own thing and then something turned
[1:05:22] around to walk with God and she wants to
[1:05:24] serve him with all her heart and and
[1:05:26] that's why he asked the question well
[1:05:27] what changed it she said Christ he says
[1:05:29] that was the experience you had that was
[1:05:31] when you received the Holy Ghost see
[1:05:33] it's such a simple thing but yet it's
[1:05:35] such a powerful thing so you're going to
[1:05:37] really look at what your
[1:05:39] desires are
[1:05:40] uh after CCS after the whatever
[1:05:43] experience it is or where you are now to
[1:05:45] what you used to be
[1:05:47] you know if you used to be just come to
[1:05:49] church don't really care mum and dad do
[1:05:51] it or whatever but now you want to serve
[1:05:52] them with all your heart what's happened
[1:05:53] Christ has stepped in
[1:05:56] and then another big thing is is
[1:05:59] there's there's a difference that
[1:06:01] changes in a person's life
[1:06:03] where where we begin there's a spirit
[1:06:06] comes within us where we am in every
[1:06:08] word
[1:06:09] so it's more than just agreeing or
[1:06:11] saying Lord I want to believe that but
[1:06:14] you actually identify in it he's talking
[1:06:16] about me
[1:06:18] that's when the spirit of God comes in
[1:06:19] and I've got a scripture to back this up
[1:06:22] see it actually changes you to it's more
[1:06:24] than just I want to be but something in
[1:06:26] you changes that you say he's talking
[1:06:28] about me
[1:06:29] right because it's actually because the
[1:06:31] spirit within you will like amen every
[1:06:33] word it's not us in our Humanity
[1:06:34] amending it trying to line up with it
[1:06:36] but God puts a spirit within us and he
[1:06:39] becomes a Christian in our lives and
[1:06:41] it's like brother Brown would give a
[1:06:42] story he'd say about a like a little boy
[1:06:45] who who lived out in the country they
[1:06:46] didn't have a mirror before he'd never
[1:06:48] seen his own reflection and then he goes
[1:06:50] and uh visits his family or someone and
[1:06:53] they have a big door door sized mirror
[1:06:55] he walks in the hallway he sees he sees
[1:06:57] a little boy in the door and and then he
[1:06:59] moves and the boy moves and moves the
[1:07:01] same way and he comes to realize that's
[1:07:03] me
[1:07:04] that's me in the mirror so there was no
[1:07:07] identification took place where he could
[1:07:09] he could actually realize the one in the
[1:07:11] mirror is is him
[1:07:13] and it's the same thing when it comes to
[1:07:15] the Bible he says so I so I just
[1:07:17] wondered today if we couldn't look in
[1:07:18] the Bible say that's me as we wonder
[1:07:20] which one it is which character in The
[1:07:22] Bible we would look at and let's just
[1:07:24] take that for a little text down and
[1:07:25] stay on it with a um for a little while
[1:07:27] as we look into God's word let's
[1:07:29] identify ourselves for he give others in
[1:07:32] here for examples of what we are now
[1:07:34] remember that God takes his Spirit or
[1:07:36] sorry takes his man but never a spirit
[1:07:38] Satan takes his man but never a spirit
[1:07:39] so let's see if we can identify our
[1:07:42] present State now with Bible characters
[1:07:43] and they the Bible said all those things
[1:07:46] happen back in those days for examples
[1:07:48] for us they're our examples so there
[1:07:52] should be something when the when the
[1:07:53] Holy Ghost comes in we can actually
[1:07:55] identify in here and it's not I want to
[1:07:57] become this you say it's right it's it's
[1:08:00] written about me how do they know who I
[1:08:02] am you know because why the same spirit
[1:08:04] that wrote the word comes into you and
[1:08:06] lives the word
[1:08:07] amen he says here and God's provided
[1:08:10] place of worship he says now you've got
[1:08:12] to be born regenerated baptized with the
[1:08:14] Holy Ghost into Jesus Christ quickened
[1:08:16] to every word your spirit in you will
[1:08:18] punctuate Amen to every word of the
[1:08:20] Bible outside of that it just shakes its
[1:08:23] head on one you've got to get rid of
[1:08:24] that spirit it's not the spirit of God
[1:08:26] that will dispute the word of God it'll
[1:08:29] keep the word of God not only does it
[1:08:31] believe it but it makes it live it
[1:08:32] manifest the word of God he says yes sir
[1:08:35] so if the spirit of God is in you you
[1:08:37] won't say the words wrong you'll say
[1:08:40] Amen your life will say Amen to it
[1:08:42] because you can identify with it because
[1:08:44] it's part of you and then in Romans 8 15
[1:08:48] and 16 he says for we have not received
[1:08:50] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:08:52] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:08:54] where you cry Abba Father the spirit
[1:08:56] that's big capital S that's the Holy
[1:08:58] Spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:09:00] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:09:02] says a bearing witness within us when
[1:09:04] the word comes forth you can identify
[1:09:06] with it because you're part of it
[1:09:08] amen now I can't tell any of you if you
[1:09:11] have the Holy Ghost that's between you
[1:09:13] and God right but I'm just saying all
[1:09:16] these things because you should be able
[1:09:17] to look something happened in your life
[1:09:18] where you can identify now with the word
[1:09:21] of God it's talking about me
[1:09:23] and and the bit that it's talking about
[1:09:24] me is not the devil part or the Lake of
[1:09:26] Fire but it's the Rapture Parts Made In
[1:09:28] His Image all the Believers down Through
[1:09:29] the Ages right there's something in you
[1:09:31] that identifies with those Believers or
[1:09:34] identifies with the scripture because
[1:09:35] the spirit a new birth what his Spirit
[1:09:37] Beth witness with yours that you're a
[1:09:39] child of God
[1:09:41] right
[1:09:42] amen so the experience can be so simple
[1:09:46] but it's so powerful because what
[1:09:47] happens is your life now changes one day
[1:09:49] you're going this way and then something
[1:09:51] happened and you all you want to do is
[1:09:52] serve him what was that that was the
[1:09:54] Lord
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:58] now
[1:09:59] now I've got a big section on a
[1:10:01] preparation of advice on courting dating
[1:10:03] and marriage
[1:10:04] now preparation
[1:10:06] what do you have in mind there's a
[1:10:08] question no no I'm putting the question
[1:10:10] back what do you have in mind what's
[1:10:11] your goal
[1:10:12] you know when it comes to courtship of
[1:10:14] marriage and dating and so on what's
[1:10:15] your goal
[1:10:17] you just want to date someone just
[1:10:18] because it's something to do everyone
[1:10:19] else is doing it or do you actually have
[1:10:21] a goal that you want to get married to a
[1:10:24] Godly person
[1:10:25] right you want to have a Godly family
[1:10:28] have Godly children
[1:10:30] you know some people well especially
[1:10:32] this day and age now when I talk about
[1:10:34] dating I'm just talking about getting to
[1:10:35] know each other I'm not talking about
[1:10:36] dating like in the world here okay so
[1:10:38] maybe I'll just give out a glossary term
[1:10:39] right there I'm not talking about
[1:10:41] worldly dating just to just to get noted
[1:10:43] like friends okay so what's your goal
[1:10:47] because ultimately
[1:10:49] we should have on on our mind that the
[1:10:52] one we're getting to know could be the
[1:10:54] one the Lord has for you and for life
[1:10:56] that's what you should be looking for
[1:10:57] ultimately long-term thinking right
[1:10:59] because this world is full of less you
[1:11:01] see where this goes
[1:11:03] and we can't be like that because the
[1:11:05] Sons and Daughters of God led by the
[1:11:06] spirit of God right God is not reactive
[1:11:09] he leads us deliberately and so we need
[1:11:11] to be really think about now where do we
[1:11:14] want this to go and that should be
[1:11:15] ultimately in our mind is this one could
[1:11:17] be the one that he wants us to as our
[1:11:20] soul mate right you know he or she is
[1:11:23] part of us
[1:11:24] and in every phase we want to treat
[1:11:28] treat others with utmost respect
[1:11:31] because they are either our spouse or
[1:11:33] someone else's and ultimately they're a
[1:11:35] son or daughter of God
[1:11:37] so you want to be very careful we're
[1:11:38] going to be careful how we treat one
[1:11:39] another we should have utmost respect
[1:11:41] because really when you think about it
[1:11:43] you we're dealing with God's children
[1:11:45] like right now I'm dealing with God's
[1:11:47] children that's that's a big thing
[1:11:49] that's not a casual thing you know so
[1:11:51] we've got to really keep that in mind
[1:11:53] that we we don't enter into anything
[1:11:55] selfishly but with prayer you know
[1:11:57] seeking God's will
[1:12:01] um it says and it says in first Timothy
[1:12:03] five one and two rebuke not the older
[1:12:05] but and treat him as a father and the
[1:12:06] younger men as Brethren the Elder women
[1:12:09] as mothers this younger as sisters with
[1:12:12] all purity
[1:12:13] so it's very important when we go into
[1:12:15] any of these things we we we we treat
[1:12:18] each other with respect right we
[1:12:19] shouldn't be afraid to talk to one
[1:12:21] another
[1:12:22] all the young people said amen
[1:12:25] don't we shouldn't get all you know no
[1:12:27] we should we should be friends right
[1:12:29] right we shouldn't be oh I can't talk to
[1:12:31] him or her whatever no no just just
[1:12:33] relax
[1:12:34] but you know see see that the dating
[1:12:37] phase what what I'm calling the dating
[1:12:39] phase is just to get to know each other
[1:12:40] before you enter into a courtship now
[1:12:43] first there should be an attraction
[1:12:45] I'm glad we have a yep somewhere
[1:12:48] there should be an attraction
[1:12:51] but then the next thing is the question
[1:12:53] should be do they know the Lord are they
[1:12:55] real Christians that should be the next
[1:12:58] thing
[1:12:59] because you can't go into anything hope
[1:13:02] hoping that they will meet the Lord
[1:13:04] you know it's like the um there's a
[1:13:06] Sight and Sound play Samson you know
[1:13:08] Samson there's one scene he wants to uh
[1:13:10] go get Mario Philistine girl and you
[1:13:13] know Samson of course his dad is not
[1:13:15] happy about it doesn't want you know
[1:13:16] Samson to get caught up with his
[1:13:18] Philistine girl and you know what Samson
[1:13:19] says but you know you're always telling
[1:13:21] us not to marry them because they'll
[1:13:23] drag us away from our garden but but
[1:13:25] what if we marry them to do the opposite
[1:13:27] why can't God do the opposite and and
[1:13:29] Samson's dad says but that's not the
[1:13:31] reason you're doing it
[1:13:33] it's not the reason you're doing it see
[1:13:35] so you can't just you can't just enter
[1:13:37] into something hoping that you know
[1:13:39] they'll become a Christian in the long
[1:13:41] run
[1:13:41] because if they don't know the Lord
[1:13:43] don't take it any further than that
[1:13:44] don't get emotionally entangled
[1:13:47] you should never do that amen and don't
[1:13:49] fixate on the what could be
[1:13:51] because the what could bees don't always
[1:13:53] end up to the reality
[1:13:55] right and and the second question really
[1:13:58] should be what kind of character do they
[1:14:00] have
[1:14:01] what kind of character do they have see
[1:14:02] who you who you marry actually reflects
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:06] brother Brown would tell us that they
[1:14:08] that that the woman is actually the
[1:14:10] heart of the man
[1:14:11] so the kind of woman that a man goes
[1:14:13] after is actually his heart
[1:14:15] now if that man is not fully surrendered
[1:14:17] to the Lord or not actually want a
[1:14:19] commitment then they'll go after that
[1:14:21] kind of a woman
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:24] but then it can be the other way around
[1:14:25] that the woman's not fully surrendered
[1:14:27] to the Lord then she can go after a man
[1:14:29] like that
[1:14:30] so we're going to look at now what kind
[1:14:32] of person am I attracted to
[1:14:34] I've actually sold out Christian that
[1:14:36] wants to serve God they can have their
[1:14:38] ups and downs their faults their fathers
[1:14:39] but do they want to serve God above all
[1:14:40] things do they know him have they had a
[1:14:42] real experience
[1:14:44] so you're going to look at that because
[1:14:45] really the person you go after reflects
[1:14:48] what's on the inside of you
[1:14:50] just like a you know a woman who's
[1:14:52] looking at you know interested in a in a
[1:14:54] guy that what what they're looking at
[1:14:57] this is the kind of leader the headship
[1:14:58] that I want for my future
[1:15:01] so it's very important that you you know
[1:15:03] we approach these things prayerfully
[1:15:05] and we really look at you know
[1:15:08] also look at how they treat other young
[1:15:10] people how they treat their families
[1:15:12] right because they can put one front up
[1:15:14] to you but then it can be a different
[1:15:15] thing you know in family circles or even
[1:15:18] you know with young people and so on so
[1:15:19] you've got to be
[1:15:20] prayerfully approach these things
[1:15:23] right it's it's very important
[1:15:26] now now I could expand that further but
[1:15:30] sorry that's just all I have on that one
[1:15:31] um but but I'm going to this later okay
[1:15:33] it's not just this is this is not the
[1:15:35] only questions and answers we'll ever
[1:15:36] have in the history of this church right
[1:15:38] so we can we can you know send it again
[1:15:41] hey more part two so I can do that now
[1:15:44] the question is now now a big question
[1:15:45] is how do I know which one is the right
[1:15:48] one because you could have right you
[1:15:50] could have someone who really knows the
[1:15:52] Lord you know they've got very good
[1:15:54] character they treat their family well
[1:15:56] you're attracted to one another but how
[1:15:58] do you know it's the right one
[1:15:59] well
[1:16:00] from my experience there's my experience
[1:16:03] okay I'm a dummy I take a while but you
[1:16:06] know when I first saw Christine I knew
[1:16:07] she was different I knew she was
[1:16:09] different she wasn't like any of the
[1:16:10] other girls in church I knew she was
[1:16:13] different and I liked it but you're
[1:16:16] special something that just caught my
[1:16:17] attention
[1:16:18] and but I was I was so maybe there was
[1:16:21] the culture of the church I was in I
[1:16:22] don't know but it was basically like
[1:16:24] don't talk to the opposite sex they're
[1:16:27] all kind of weird about that kind of
[1:16:28] stuff we shouldn't be weird about that
[1:16:29] kind of stuff it's normal right and um
[1:16:32] and so I knew she was different I liked
[1:16:36] her you know we you know I knew she
[1:16:38] loved the Lord so all those things were
[1:16:41] fitting into place and I wasn't even
[1:16:42] really looking to get married I was just
[1:16:44] happy serving God you know but thing is
[1:16:46] when you know and then and then and then
[1:16:49] so it started our friendship started to
[1:16:51] grow but she hasn't Tauranga I was down
[1:16:52] in Christchurch and she would visit
[1:16:54] every so often but um you know they came
[1:16:57] to a point where I was like Lord I need
[1:16:59] to know I need to know she's the one and
[1:17:01] we were just friends that's as far as it
[1:17:04] went because I didn't want to waste her
[1:17:05] time I thought she's an incredible young
[1:17:07] woman she's awesome she's one eight
[1:17:10] billion now you know she's Priceless so
[1:17:12] I don't want to one hurt her or you know
[1:17:14] get emotionally entangled and it's not
[1:17:16] right or you know I didn't want to do
[1:17:17] that to her because she's worth far more
[1:17:19] than that and that's I think how we
[1:17:20] should approach these things we should
[1:17:22] be careful right and then now this is
[1:17:24] over I think over a year she could tell
[1:17:26] you the story far better than I could
[1:17:27] but it was over a year from our first
[1:17:29] meeting given to win win when this was
[1:17:31] coming up and the Lord had already told
[1:17:33] her multiple times Ben's your husband
[1:17:35] you know in the world heard multiple
[1:17:37] times spoke to Audible Voice all kinds
[1:17:39] you know God I mean God just talks to
[1:17:41] her a lot and um but me it takes me a
[1:17:43] while to catch up you know but the
[1:17:45] slowest City win the race I hope
[1:17:47] um you know but so I was I was praying
[1:17:49] because I said Lord I want to know and
[1:17:51] how how God you still works with me as
[1:17:53] he is as he speaks to me out of here
[1:17:56] and I think you've got to really know
[1:17:58] it's such an important thing
[1:18:00] at every age you know God's leadership
[1:18:03] in your life
[1:18:04] see just like Dave said about the um you
[1:18:06] know the van and everything that you
[1:18:07] know I believe that was the Lord
[1:18:09] speaking to you the thing is the more he
[1:18:11] speaks the more you can trust his voice
[1:18:12] because remember the Bible says my sheep
[1:18:14] know my voice and so there must be a way
[1:18:16] he speaks to you but it's proven
[1:18:19] that that you can actually because
[1:18:20] because God interprets this word by
[1:18:22] bringing it to pass right so if he
[1:18:24] speaks to a certain thing and it comes
[1:18:25] to pass then you know it's him
[1:18:27] and um and of course it won't be out of
[1:18:29] his word it'll be in his according to
[1:18:31] his word but how he speaks to you you
[1:18:33] should have confidence how he leads you
[1:18:35] so that's why it's so important that you
[1:18:37] know the leadership of the shepherd
[1:18:39] the Lord Jesus Christ you must know
[1:18:41] that's so important and so
[1:18:44] you know the Lord would show her you
[1:18:46] know in the scripture multiple places
[1:18:47] multiple times and you know I was going
[1:18:49] to see her on the 18th of uh October I
[1:18:52] believe it was and um she was reading
[1:18:54] Proverbs on the 17th of October I mean
[1:18:56] yes on yeah on the 17th of October she's
[1:18:57] reading Proverbs chapter 18 and she had
[1:19:00] no idea that um that that at this stage
[1:19:03] I would read a proverb every day it was
[1:19:05] like my devotional in the morning like
[1:19:07] first of the month I'd read Proverbs one
[1:19:09] and as we go on and so I was doing this
[1:19:11] for about a year by this stage
[1:19:14] and she was reading proverbs 18. and
[1:19:16] there's a scripture here it says and
[1:19:18] whosoever findeth a wife findeth a good
[1:19:19] thing to obtained favor of the Lord and
[1:19:23] see the Lord said do it once again see
[1:19:25] Ben's your husband and she said Lord
[1:19:27] that's great you tell me but tell him
[1:19:30] I think it's a good way God should work
[1:19:32] both ends right you should never ever
[1:19:34] see see me maybe I'm just a bit slow and
[1:19:37] stuff but I just have confidence God if
[1:19:39] he shows you something I believe he'll
[1:19:40] make it happen
[1:19:41] sure you don't sit in the corner and you
[1:19:43] know but but God so we don't have to
[1:19:45] force things to happen right if God is
[1:19:47] leading you he will cause it to happen
[1:19:49] and so she said yep well that's great
[1:19:51] Lord but tell him so the next morning
[1:19:52] which is the proverb which is the 18th
[1:19:55] of of
[1:19:55] um October I was reading Proverbs 18.
[1:19:58] and I got down to that verse and as soon
[1:20:00] as I got and I read that for over a year
[1:20:02] but as soon as I read that verse the
[1:20:03] Lord said Christine is your wife
[1:20:05] so he confirmed it in the scripture
[1:20:08] right so I mean that's my experience
[1:20:11] that's how I know she's the right one
[1:20:13] one we're attracted to each other we
[1:20:15] love each other but he confirmed it in
[1:20:16] the scripture
[1:20:17] right so we can and and there's many
[1:20:19] other places as well but we can we can
[1:20:21] take always take it back to there
[1:20:23] so you can have confidence now boom so
[1:20:26] yeah so it's awesome but you know you
[1:20:28] just got to rest in the Lord's
[1:20:29] leadership
[1:20:31] you know just just trust them and uh
[1:20:33] he'll he'll he'll see you through you
[1:20:35] know I'm sure we can we could all have
[1:20:37] testimonies where God led us through
[1:20:38] right showed us which way to go so so
[1:20:41] just know his leadership and like even
[1:20:44] brother bam says you know like your
[1:20:45] parents they can instruct you in these
[1:20:47] things
[1:20:48] so if you've got a question about a boy
[1:20:49] or a girl go to your mum and dad
[1:20:52] go to them remember because they know
[1:20:54] you better than you know yourself
[1:20:56] you know they raise you as a baby they
[1:20:58] bottle feed you they did everything for
[1:20:59] you then then here you are at this age
[1:21:01] so talk to them
[1:21:02] right because sure they'll they'll have
[1:21:05] their mama bear you know defenses and
[1:21:07] papa bear depending on boy or girl but
[1:21:09] they have they can see things you cannot
[1:21:11] see
[1:21:12] rights are always always have your
[1:21:14] parents involved because Dad is
[1:21:16] gatekeeper to the daughter right so it's
[1:21:17] absolutely essential that when it comes
[1:21:20] to boys gonna go wanting to know girls
[1:21:23] they have to talk to the dad
[1:21:25] because it's got to be a respective
[1:21:26] headship because ultimately there's
[1:21:28] going to be a transfer of headship where
[1:21:29] where she will come under your head
[1:21:31] chips there's a very important thing you
[1:21:32] respect to a current headship it's
[1:21:34] absolutely essential because it's far
[1:21:35] head chippers are far more spiritual
[1:21:37] important thing than we realize it's not
[1:21:39] just a here's the family tree and this
[1:21:41] one's marriage of this no it's farmer
[1:21:42] it's a spiritual thing so it's very
[1:21:44] important that you keep your
[1:21:46] um
[1:21:47] talk to your appearance about them
[1:21:50] okay
[1:21:52] they will they will help you out far
[1:21:54] more than I think anyone ever could in
[1:21:56] those you know in those matters
[1:21:58] anyway we can go part two um later on
[1:22:00] that so now
[1:22:03] when do we start this 2 30. okay
[1:22:06] this won't take much longer now how to
[1:22:08] have unconditional love
[1:22:10] so unconditional love has no conditions
[1:22:12] so if you want to have an unconditional
[1:22:15] love don't look for love in return
[1:22:17] see don't look so so brother bam says
[1:22:19] it's like Grace you know Grace is not
[1:22:21] I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch
[1:22:22] mine gracious says you need a back
[1:22:25] scratch I'll scratch your back it's the
[1:22:27] same thing with unconditional love
[1:22:28] you're not looking for anything good in
[1:22:29] response but you want to give love
[1:22:31] anyway and the reason why we give love
[1:22:33] anyway is because we have an end goal in
[1:22:35] mind so maybe there's a family of its
[1:22:37] Wayward you want them to meet the Lord
[1:22:38] or a friend or whoever it may be then
[1:22:40] you love them unconditionally because
[1:22:42] you have faith Lord that you're going to
[1:22:44] get hold of them through this
[1:22:46] so I think it's a very but you've got to
[1:22:48] have that end goal in mind and you've
[1:22:49] got to
[1:22:51] um just love them no matter what comes
[1:22:53] back because it's unconditional
[1:22:55] right but remember you've got to have
[1:22:57] faith Lord You're Gonna touch them
[1:22:58] through this in some way
[1:23:01] amen uh advice for mine battles now
[1:23:05] first you've got to identify it's a mind
[1:23:06] battle
[1:23:07] because sometimes the devil can be
[1:23:09] talking to you and you can just be
[1:23:10] thinking it's you I get into that trap
[1:23:12] quite a lot that I realize hold on
[1:23:14] hold on so first you identify it's a
[1:23:17] mind battle
[1:23:18] and then secondly don't entertain them
[1:23:20] think the opposite
[1:23:21] you know if you've got a mind battle
[1:23:23] like an inferiority complex no one likes
[1:23:25] you no one cares think the opposite
[1:23:27] you know do the opposite that's so
[1:23:30] important you know also your mind think
[1:23:32] of you know like the Apostle Paul gives
[1:23:34] such good instruction here and in in in
[1:23:36] Ephesians 5 19 20. speaking to
[1:23:39] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[1:23:41] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:23:42] melody in your heart to the Lord giving
[1:23:45] thanks always for all things unto God
[1:23:47] and the father in the name of our Lord
[1:23:49] Jesus Christ so if you've got mind
[1:23:51] bowels and you're feeling down and you
[1:23:53] know because you know mind bowels will
[1:23:54] will always try and isolate you make you
[1:23:57] feel down and make you feel bad against
[1:23:59] other people
[1:24:00] that's how they and make you feel
[1:24:01] worthless
[1:24:02] right because you know you you look at
[1:24:05] the conclusion of the whole thought
[1:24:06] process that's really what it wants to
[1:24:07] do the deer wants to isolate you make
[1:24:09] you think you're worthless no one cares
[1:24:10] you have no value you know that's what
[1:24:12] he wants to do but if you if you speak
[1:24:15] to yourself in your heart to the Lord as
[1:24:17] you know with Psalms and hymns and
[1:24:19] spiritual songs and making melody in
[1:24:21] your heart what happens is your thinking
[1:24:22] will change
[1:24:23] right so so if you're going through a
[1:24:25] mind battle what's your favorite song
[1:24:27] push play in here and sing it with all
[1:24:30] your heart only well if you can sing
[1:24:31] outwardly but if you can't sing you're
[1:24:33] singing yeah right but I mean you can
[1:24:35] sing outwardly anyway but you know what
[1:24:36] I mean like change the atmosphere don't
[1:24:38] just keep and and the Bible says that we
[1:24:41] can cast down imaginations and every
[1:24:43] High thing that exalts itself against
[1:24:44] the knowledge of God and bring into
[1:24:46] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:24:48] of Christ and I think the best way to do
[1:24:50] that if you can see your you're having a
[1:24:52] mind battle some kind of negative
[1:24:53] thought going on it's so good you start
[1:24:56] singing and giving thanks to the Lord on
[1:24:57] your heart it will change your thinking
[1:25:00] you know I think it's such a powerful
[1:25:01] thing that you know you know the Lord
[1:25:03] would have uh Inspire the Apostle Paul
[1:25:05] to write there in you know in Ephesians
[1:25:07] 5. it's absolutely important now
[1:25:09] next question we can go on these things
[1:25:11] another way yo if you want part two say
[1:25:14] there's more to that surely okay how to
[1:25:17] spread the gospel to the people in the
[1:25:18] world that's such a fundamental this is
[1:25:20] why we're here going to All Nations and
[1:25:22] preach the gospel the first thing is
[1:25:24] pray first
[1:25:26] be be prayerful
[1:25:28] be prayerful because we want to find
[1:25:30] that last one that we can go home
[1:25:32] hey don't ultimately want to go home you
[1:25:35] know I hope I didn't make it sound wrong
[1:25:36] on Wednesday you know we should want to
[1:25:39] go on a Rapture right but we shouldn't
[1:25:41] want to go because we're unhappy with
[1:25:43] our current life we should want to go
[1:25:45] because we want to see him
[1:25:46] okay but that you know but there's a
[1:25:48] whole reason you want to see Souls come
[1:25:50] in because we would find that last one
[1:25:51] that we can go home
[1:25:53] and even even even the Lord would say in
[1:25:56] Matthew and you know also in a different
[1:25:57] gospel um you know pray ye the lord of
[1:25:59] the Harvest that he'll send laborers
[1:26:01] into his Harvest so to say Lord send
[1:26:03] laborers into your Harvest even though
[1:26:04] he's the lord of the Harvest himself
[1:26:06] you know so so I think it's so important
[1:26:08] that we have on our heart
[1:26:10] that we try and witness the people
[1:26:13] now if you if you're looking for what to
[1:26:16] say I believe the Lord will guide you
[1:26:18] but people are looking for reality they
[1:26:21] don't want a theory they don't want a
[1:26:22] religion they want a reality so I think
[1:26:25] one of the best things to do is tell
[1:26:26] them how your candle got lit tell them
[1:26:29] what happened to you tell them what
[1:26:30] Jesus has done for you
[1:26:32] right because show them the reality of
[1:26:35] the message people are looking for
[1:26:36] reality they don't want religion
[1:26:38] you know and if you talk to someone and
[1:26:41] you got on your heart you want to
[1:26:42] witness to them mention God or church or
[1:26:45] a testimony in as you're talking and see
[1:26:48] how they respond if they just ignore it
[1:26:50] well then maybe you know but then if
[1:26:52] they start changing the subject towards
[1:26:54] the Lord or saying then you can open it
[1:26:56] further right but so so take an opening
[1:26:59] if it's there but stop when you feel
[1:27:00] resistance
[1:27:02] you've got to be sensitive to the Lord
[1:27:03] you know too
[1:27:05] and also remember that your life speaks
[1:27:07] louder than you realize
[1:27:09] so you're actually a living testimony
[1:27:11] without even saying anything you're
[1:27:13] because people read us read Our Lives
[1:27:16] see our character see how we respond to
[1:27:18] things they're watching they're reading
[1:27:19] us and saying is what he believes or she
[1:27:22] believes producing that
[1:27:23] you know because they may never come to
[1:27:25] this church read the Bible or listen to
[1:27:27] the message but they'll read your life
[1:27:29] and so I think it's so important to
[1:27:32] spread the gospel start with just being
[1:27:34] a living witness to the people you know
[1:27:36] at school or job or wherever it may be
[1:27:39] and and let the Lord lead you maybe
[1:27:41] you'll lead you to hand out tracks or
[1:27:43] give out books or sing on the street
[1:27:44] corner but whatever it is just start by
[1:27:46] being a witness to those around you
[1:27:49] amen it starts you know it all starts
[1:27:52] like that
[1:27:53] right and God can God can guide it but
[1:27:56] you know it's it's so important just
[1:27:59] just trust in the Lord and have a burden
[1:28:01] for lost souls
[1:28:03] right and and just go be a witness and
[1:28:06] see however it'll you know the Lord is
[1:28:08] the one who brings them in but I think
[1:28:11] it's a good it's a good burden to have
[1:28:12] now we can go on more about that too now
[1:28:14] how to trust in the Lord even in the
[1:28:16] silent moments of Life how to trust in
[1:28:18] him well that's when Faith takes you
[1:28:20] through
[1:28:21] it's when God is silent that's when
[1:28:22] Faith really takes you through
[1:28:25] see remember he didn't save you to lose
[1:28:27] you always remember that
[1:28:29] now it says in James here my brother
[1:28:31] encountered all joy when you fall into
[1:28:33] diverse Temptations knowing this that
[1:28:35] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:28:37] patience
[1:28:38] say that when your faith is tried when
[1:28:40] the when when God seems silent but but
[1:28:43] you see the enemy's doing something is
[1:28:44] trouble well your faith will work the
[1:28:47] trying of your faith worketh patience
[1:28:48] now that worketh means to work out to do
[1:28:52] that from which something results so so
[1:28:55] you get you so the trying of your faith
[1:28:56] will work your patience we'll we'll
[1:28:58] we'll produce a result now that patience
[1:29:01] is patience with God
[1:29:04] amen so when he's silent you can be able
[1:29:07] to rest and trust in him that in his
[1:29:10] time he will answer he will come on the
[1:29:12] scene
[1:29:12] but just because he doesn't speak
[1:29:14] straight away doesn't mean you just quit
[1:29:17] keep serving the lord
[1:29:19] right we'll have silent moments in our
[1:29:21] life where we we can't seem to find a an
[1:29:23] answer from you know you know just said
[1:29:25] Lord where are you but he said I'll
[1:29:27] never leave the nor forsake me and we
[1:29:29] can have confidence that he will he will
[1:29:31] guide us through but see Faith see if if
[1:29:34] we knew from this moment
[1:29:36] every detail of our life to the rapture
[1:29:38] we wouldn't need faith because God's
[1:29:41] already shown us
[1:29:42] right but it's a we walk by faith and
[1:29:44] not by sight
[1:29:46] so Eve so in those silent moments God
[1:29:49] hasn't left you you just have confidence
[1:29:51] that he'll see you through those moments
[1:29:52] just keep walking through
[1:29:55] amen you've got to be certain of God
[1:29:59] amen maybe I'll just
[1:30:02] read this here he says
[1:30:04] um yeah but let patients have a perfect
[1:30:05] work that you may be perfect an entire
[1:30:07] wanting nothing if any of you lack
[1:30:09] Wisdom ask him of God that giveth to all
[1:30:12] men liberally and upgradeth not and it
[1:30:14] shall be given them but let him ask in
[1:30:17] faith nothing wavering for he that
[1:30:19] waveereth is like a wave of the sea
[1:30:21] driven with the wind and toss so don't
[1:30:24] be wavering will you get the answer or
[1:30:25] not is he with you or not you know he's
[1:30:28] with you
[1:30:29] hey man so you can just rest in him
[1:30:33] praise the Lord let's just um
[1:30:36] and how do you display eternal life and
[1:30:38] live for others well that's you know by
[1:30:40] showing unconditional love you display
[1:30:42] eternal life just by your actions by
[1:30:43] your life that you live
[1:30:45] because remember we don't get eternal
[1:30:46] life by walking in these doors and then
[1:30:48] we when we walk out there we're like the
[1:30:49] world we're Christians everywhere right
[1:30:51] right so so your life when you go to
[1:30:54] work you go to school wherever you go
[1:30:55] it's actually eternal life on display
[1:30:57] but it's just like the Lord Jesus you
[1:30:59] know he was he looked like anyone else
[1:31:02] he you know he dressed in the common
[1:31:04] common robes everything he looked like
[1:31:06] anyone else but there was eternal life
[1:31:07] walking it was God made flesh walking
[1:31:10] the streets of Galilee and so on and
[1:31:12] Nazareth and you know so it can be so
[1:31:14] simple but yet it's God
[1:31:16] so just just display eternal life by by
[1:31:19] being salty create an atmosphere people
[1:31:21] like to be around you you know they say
[1:31:23] man I like that person he's so friendly
[1:31:24] they're so kind they're so warm and
[1:31:26] what's they doing that's an atmosphere
[1:31:27] it's crap it's putting an influence on
[1:31:29] someone they can come and meet the same
[1:31:30] God you know
[1:31:31] right that's how you do it amen let's um
[1:31:34] let's just hit pause there and if you
[1:31:37] want me to expand on any of those points
[1:31:39] we can we can pick it up next time let's
