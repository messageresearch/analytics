[4:47] [music]
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Good morning.
[4:52] You happy?
[4:55] We live in such a great country. Can I
[4:57] just let you know that
[4:59] like we can drive here on nice roads
[5:04] because this [music] country is one run
[5:06] well. The Lord's blessed us with a with
[5:08] a system that it just it runs well. We
[5:11] can all go out to work. Our power's on.
[5:13] We get everyone gets paid [music] and we
[5:16] can come here freely and just worship
[5:18] the Lord. There's no there's no
[5:20] restrictions whatsoever [music]
[5:21] that we can all meet together and
[5:23] worship the Lord.
[5:26] We're in the top echelon of the world.
[5:30] The the the what we [music] have. I
[5:32] sometimes wonder what the Lord thinks.
[5:34] You know, when we when I complain about
[5:35] my first world problems, when I when
[5:37] really I have I I'm we're so blessed in
[5:40] this country that we can [music] we can
[5:41] be here this morning. We can worship
[5:43] God.
[5:45] Our life works well. We have such easy
[5:47] lives here. And and you know, when I
[5:50] think about that, I think, Lord, I want
[5:52] to do what I can to, you know, utilize
[5:53] these resources you've given and bless
[5:55] your kingdom and just just, you know, do
[5:57] whatever we can for the Lord, which I
[5:59] know you will do as well. So, let's um
[6:01] let's stand. Let's [music] thank the
[6:02] Lord that he's for blessing us so much
[6:04] and and you know but he adds blessing
[6:07] upon blessing. So even if we have
[6:09] everything, he still wants to come down
[6:10] and and meet our hearts. You know,
[6:12] because it doesn't matter what part of
[6:13] the world you're in, doesn't matter
[6:14] where you are.
[6:16] You know, when [music] we come to the
[6:17] Lord with the right heart, then the
[6:19] living God will meet someone in this in
[6:21] a great country like this or in a
[6:23] country that doesn't work, but doesn't
[6:24] that that stuff doesn't matter when it
[6:26] comes to the human heart connecting with
[6:27] the Lord and the spirit of God meeting
[6:29] the human heart. Like you can be in a
[6:30] prison and meet the Lord there and often
[6:32] people do because they got more time to
[6:34] focus on God. But you know, so we we
[6:36] want to just lay all this stuff [music]
[6:38] aside this morning and and with our
[6:40] hearts come to before the Lord with an
[6:42] open heart and just let the Lord work in
[6:44] [music] our midst this morning. So let's
[6:45] just bow our heads. Lord, we thank you
[6:47] for the this opportunity, Lord, that we
[6:49] can that we know you, Lord, that you've
[6:52] revealed yourself to us, Lord, that we
[6:55] can come here and under expectation,
[6:58] [music] not not as not turning up as
[7:01] critical or as let's see what happens.
[7:04] But but as believers, Lord, we we've all
[7:06] each one of us this morning, we've all
[7:07] turned up as believers this morning,
[7:10] Lord. We believe in the Son of God. We
[7:12] believe you, Lord, that you that you're
[7:14] the great creator of the universe. That
[7:16] you came down, Lord. That you paid the
[7:18] price for our sins. That you filled us
[7:19] with the Holy Ghost, Lord. That you move
[7:21] in our mids. That you work through a a
[7:23] body, Lord. That you work through a
[7:24] five-fold ministry. That there are gifts
[7:26] in our midst. That we all have callings,
[7:29] Lord. That we are victorious in you,
[7:31] Lord. We're all believers this morning.
[7:32] So, we just pray, Lord, that you said
[7:35] we're two or three gathered together in
[7:36] your name. We believe that you said
[7:38] there you are in the midst, Lord. So, we
[7:39] know that you're going to be here with
[7:40] us this morning. You're going to you're
[7:42] going to bless us. You're going to fill
[7:43] each heart with your spirit. Lord,
[7:45] [music] that each each person here is
[7:46] going to leave this place more on fire
[7:49] for you, changed, renewed, refreshed in
[7:52] the Holy Ghost. Lord, that's what is
[7:54] going to happen today. Because where the
[7:56] spirit of God is, there's liberty, Lord.
[7:57] And when you come, there's always
[7:58] victory. Lord, there's always a [music]
[8:00] there's there's the shout of the king in
[8:01] the camp, Lord. It brings us so much
[8:03] victory. So, we just commit the service
[8:04] to you. Bless brother Ben as he
[8:05] ministers, Lord. May you just anoint him
[8:08] with the Holy Ghost and he he speak as
[8:10] the oracles of God this morning. So we

[37:51] go to the scripture this morning. We're
[37:52] going to go to Genesis uh chapter 3 and
[37:56] um verses 9 to 9-15.
[38:03] And then we're going to Yeah, we're just
[38:06] going to read this here. So, Genesis 3
[38:08] and 9-15
[38:10] and um he's going to hear my musings
[38:13] basically for the week. They're coming
[38:15] out on a Sunday. So, um Genesis 3 and 9
[38:20] um yeah 9 says this, "And the Lord God
[38:23] called unto Adam and said unto him,
[38:24] where art thou?" And he said, "I heard
[38:26] thy voice in the garden, and I was
[38:28] afraid because I was naked, and I hid
[38:31] myself." And he said, "Who told thee
[38:33] that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of
[38:36] the tree whereof I commanded thee that
[38:38] thou shouldest not uh eat? And the man
[38:41] said, The woman whom thou gavest to uh
[38:43] to be with me, she gave me of the tree,
[38:46] and I did eat. And the Lord God said And
[38:50] the Lord God said unto the woman, "What
[38:52] is this that thou hast done?" And the
[38:55] woman said, "The serpent begal me, and I
[38:57] did eat." And the Lord God said unto the
[38:59] servant, "Because thou has done this,
[39:01] thou art cursed above all cattle, and
[39:03] above every beast of the field, upon thy
[39:05] belly thou shalt go, and dust shall uh
[39:08] dust shall thou eat all the days of thy
[39:10] life. And I'll put emnity between thee
[39:12] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[39:14] her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and
[39:16] thou I mean, sorry, that it shall bruise
[39:18] thy head, and thou shall bruise his
[39:20] heel." Amen. So may the Lord bless the
[39:22] reading of his word. Let's just bow our
[39:23] heads in a word of prayer. If you have a
[39:24] need, as always, just slip your hand up,
[39:26] say, "Lord, remember me during this
[39:28] day." Amen. Let us pray. Gracious
[39:30] Father, we thank you so much, Lord, as
[39:32] we have this grand opportunity to come
[39:33] into your presence once again. And as
[39:35] we've read your great eternal word,
[39:37] Lord, we need you to come on the scene,
[39:39] Lord God, to anoint your word to our
[39:41] hearts. May you anoint me to speak,
[39:43] anoint everyone to hear. May you take
[39:44] complete control as we know the greatest
[39:46] thing we, you know, the greatest gift
[39:48] any of us could ever have is to get
[39:50] ourselves out of the way that you can do
[39:51] what you want to do. So, Father, we all
[39:53] want to get ourselves out of the way
[39:54] today. Not just me, but all of us here
[39:56] that you can you can you can worship
[39:58] through us, Lord. You can do what you
[40:00] want. Touch every heart, Lord. Meet
[40:02] every life. Lord, both here and those
[40:03] who are streaming. Dear God, be our be
[40:06] our portion this day. We love you. We
[40:08] thank you for this day in Jesus Christ's
[40:09] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[40:12] have your seats this morning.
[40:15] I'd like to speak, if I could, if I
[40:16] could title this, uh, I'd like to speak
[40:19] about a victim mentality. this morning.
[40:22] Now, this may seem a bit negative, but
[40:24] we're going to go positive, okay? So,
[40:27] not that a victim mentality is positive,
[40:28] but we just need to look into I think,
[40:31] you know, I've been I've been kind of
[40:32] musing about the day and age we live in.
[40:35] And there is a a big a big expansion of
[40:41] this thought of people are victims.
[40:45] And it's how it it it has shaped
[40:48] people's thinking. It shaped how they
[40:50] live. It shaped uh their attitudes uh
[40:53] where everyone is a victim of something.
[40:56] And this was first shown in the Garden
[40:58] of Eden where where Adam begin to blame
[41:02] uh his wife. He actually was blaming
[41:03] God. That's why I put it in yellow. Uh
[41:05] he said the woman whom thou gavest to be
[41:08] with me. This is the reason I have
[41:11] befallen this calamity. This is why we
[41:14] hid ourselves, fears gripped us, sin has
[41:16] overtaken us. Is because it's your
[41:18] fault, God. you set me up to fail. And a
[41:21] victim mentality, as we'll read the
[41:23] definition soon, is always puts the puts
[41:26] the problem or the responsibility of the
[41:29] reason why things have happened on
[41:31] someone else. Never it never takes
[41:33] ownership for for what has happened. And
[41:36] so we can see here just from the very
[41:38] first time fallen man begins to speak.
[41:40] See, before this happened, uh Adam, Adam
[41:43] Adam as as as the last uh act of being a
[41:46] son of God, his position tried to save
[41:48] Eve. His first act as a fallen son of
[41:51] God was blaming God for why he's in this
[41:55] position. Is everyone following me
[41:56] today? I mean, so this was this was the
[41:59] uh so this is the first time that fallen
[42:02] man would have a victim mentality would
[42:03] would would would blame someone else for
[42:06] the reason they're in this state. Now I
[42:08] don't believe we are in this condition
[42:10] today but this is a spirit that's upon
[42:12] the world that wants to come upon you.
[42:14] This age of lados oair of people's
[42:16] rights and entitlement cuz entitlement
[42:18] and victim mentality is very intertwined
[42:20] together. This wants to get into your
[42:22] thinking gets into your attitudes. This
[42:24] anointing wants to take over your life
[42:26] that instead of being an overcomer meant
[42:28] you're a victim.
[42:30] You know, if I can say it, the only
[42:32] thing we're a victim of is God's grace
[42:34] and and and election, if I can put it
[42:37] that way. You know, not that we're
[42:39] victims, but you understand if what what
[42:41] what governs your life is really what
[42:43] your identity is. Okay? So now, if
[42:46] you're a victim, then that is your
[42:49] identity. You've been wronged by someone
[42:51] something or your forebears or whatever.
[42:53] Now, I'm not diminishing any of history.
[42:56] It happened. It was terrible. We
[42:58] understand that. I'm not sweeping
[42:59] anything under the rug, but how do we
[43:01] deal with it as individuals? Now, how do
[43:03] we how do we deal with it? Because the
[43:05] world wants us to deal with it in a very
[43:08] negative way of being a victim.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; We could all find something we're a
[43:11] victim of.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what country we're from,
[43:14] race, gender, whatever age, you know,
[43:16] even our upbringings, people will live
[43:17] under. They're a victim of their
[43:19] upbringing and they just let that thing
[43:21] rule them. Why not? Why not overcome
[43:23] that? Why not actually say, "No, the
[43:25] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from
[43:26] all sin. Amen. He's the remedy to my
[43:29] pain. He's the remedy to my hurt. He's
[43:31] the remedy of my past. Why not? Why not
[43:34] let God take control? Now, now Google
[43:37] will say a victim mentality or a victim
[43:39] complex is a persistent mindset where
[43:42] someone sees themselves as a perpetual
[43:45] victim believing bad things always uh
[43:47] happen to them due to others actions or
[43:50] unfair circumstances, feeling helpless
[43:52] and avoiding personal responsibility,
[43:55] often stemming from trauma or defense
[43:57] mechanisms. It's characterized by
[44:00] blaming others, feeling powerless, and
[44:02] interpreting events negatively even when
[44:05] evidence suggests otherwise. That means
[44:07] that someone who has a victim mentality
[44:09] and someone who doesn't can have the
[44:11] same upbringing, have the same parents,
[44:12] have the same everything exactly the
[44:14] same. They can be literally twins,
[44:16] identical twins. One can have a victim
[44:18] mentality, one cannot. And and and the
[44:21] one with the victim mentality always
[44:22] look at everything negative. Oh, mom was
[44:24] like this, dad was like this, and this
[44:26] was all negative and nothing was fine.
[44:28] But the person who's the overcomer will
[44:30] look at those same circumstances, that
[44:32] same story, and their conclusion comes
[44:34] out different because they're not a
[44:35] victim.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Now,
[44:39] we understand that everything everything
[44:41] we go through will either make us better
[44:43] or bitter people, right? So, pain pain,
[44:47] you know, the devil uses pain to try and
[44:49] open a door into someone's spirit. And
[44:51] this is where depression comes from.
[44:53] This is where any any kind of uh
[44:55] spiritual wounding can happen is when
[44:57] there's a trauma, something happens and
[45:00] then what does he do? the devil tries to
[45:02] get you to agree with him that he can
[45:03] open that door and he can step into that
[45:06] thing just like a complex or a pain or a
[45:08] hurt or you know anything people who
[45:10] people have a complex of their of their
[45:13] of their gender even you know because
[45:15] the devil whispers to them you're on the
[45:16] wrong side of the fence and you know
[45:18] this is not where you belong and all the
[45:20] negative perceived negatives you know of
[45:22] that gender but you know what does he do
[45:24] he's trying to step into a wound that
[45:26] shouldn't be there
[45:27] &gt;&gt; but it's but but but it's how you
[45:29] respond to his his uh his preaching, you
[45:33] know, do you say amen to him and say,
[45:35] "Yes, I'm a victim and poor me and I,
[45:37] you know, I don't deserve I, you know, I
[45:39] shouldn't have been raised in that
[45:40] family." God placed you in that family.
[45:42] God gave you certain parents because
[45:45] like brother Bram says, it's like when
[45:46] they mold a mold a bell, you know, a
[45:49] bell you put in a tow that you ring,
[45:50] right? They take certain amount of iron
[45:52] and different elements and he and he
[45:54] molds the bell. He shapes it a certain
[45:56] way cuz it gives a specific sound he's
[45:58] wanting to give, right? It's like God,
[46:00] he took our forebears and he ordained
[46:02] this one to marry this one and this one
[46:04] not to marry that one, but to marry this
[46:06] one. And it all come down because God is
[46:08] molding your character. He's molding
[46:10] your nature a certain way through your
[46:12] natural lineage. And he'll allow even
[46:14] complexes to come into your life because
[46:16] he wants you to be a certain way.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Like brother Bram, he he actually he
[46:21] said he had a complex against immoral
[46:23] woman.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; God allowed him to have that complex
[46:27] &gt;&gt; because he had to be Elijah. His
[46:29] upbringing shaped him a certain way. He
[46:32] was a man of the wilderness. If he was
[46:34] an urban, spoiled rich kid, he would not
[46:36] have been a man of the wilderness. He
[46:38] would have been a man of the cafe. I
[46:41] don't know, whatever you want to call.
[46:42] Yeah. But but he would just he wouldn't
[46:43] touch grass, you know. He wouldn't have
[46:45] been out what but so his upbringing
[46:47] shaped him because he had to be a
[46:48] certain way. So God used that to bring
[46:51] an expression out of his life. Now it's
[46:53] very easy to see brother Brown that way.
[46:55] But what about yourself? Right? See, God
[46:57] has mold us. He's given us. We are not a
[47:00] cosmic accident.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; We are not by chance. You did not come
[47:04] here by chance. You came here by design.
[47:07] You g came here by election, by
[47:09] predestination. And how you came, the
[47:11] the the nation you're born in. Amen.
[47:14] Your parents, your socioeconomic
[47:17] settings, or how rich or poor you were,
[47:20] God allowed that because God wanted a
[47:23] certain nature. He wanted a certain
[47:25] thing. When your bell sounds that only
[47:28] you can ting.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; I'm custom made.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't just come off some
[47:36] stamp machine factory thing. No. No. I'm
[47:39] custom built.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we're all custom
[47:42] built.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz God had a certain sound
[47:45] he wanted to give.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the key characteristics of
[47:50] a of a person with a victim mentality uh
[47:54] it's blaming others, attributing
[47:55] misfortune to external factors like
[47:58] partners, family or the world rather
[48:00] than personal choices. Lack of control,
[48:03] feeling helpless and believing outcomes
[48:06] are entirely outside their influence.
[48:09] Pessimism, expecting negative results
[48:11] and feeling constantly wronged. avoiding
[48:14] responsibility, deflecting
[48:16] accountability for mistakes or problems,
[48:18] seeking sympathy, sometimes driven by a
[48:21] need for attention or validation of
[48:23] their suffering. They interpret neutral
[48:26] events as personal attacks, resist
[48:29] solutions because problems reinforce
[48:31] their identity or worldview. This is
[48:34] some now this is just Google, okay? This
[48:36] is not me and my putting words here.
[48:38] This is what Google told me, okay? that
[48:41] this is [laughter] this is the symptoms
[48:42] of someone who had now this is not
[48:44] saying we won't have moments of feeling
[48:46] sorry for oursel who's had those moments
[48:48] let's be honest
[48:49] &gt;&gt; you're like why me going through this
[48:51] but you don't stay in that state all the
[48:53] time okay so so we have those moments
[48:56] okay we'll feel down we'll feel poor me
[48:58] and overwhelmed and all those things are
[49:00] natural but someone who has a victim
[49:02] mentality that's the only way they view
[49:04] everything you know they're like Eeyore
[49:06] and Winnie the Pooh they're always
[49:08] negative and down and life is terrible
[49:10] It can be the greatest day ever and it's
[49:12] the wor it's just just average at best.
[49:14] Average is the you know so but so they
[49:16] always look at they always blame someone
[49:20] for what they've gone through just like
[49:21] Adam did in the beginning. Now
[49:24] people with a victim mentality is they
[49:26] always look at they always look at a
[49:29] like they're just a victim of of their
[49:31] environment. Now we look at Cain.
[49:35] Cain was Cain's sacrifice was excellent
[49:37] but it was rejected by God.
[49:40] and and he came to a place in his life
[49:43] where he just blamed it was God's fault
[49:45] that he was rejected.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; You know, he's just a victim of why
[49:50] didn't I get a revelation? Why didn't
[49:52] you know, it's always an inward-looking
[49:54] thing, a victim mentality. It's not
[49:56] outward looking. It's all about self.
[49:57] Self is exalted and the state they find
[50:00] themselves in. So, Cain was Cain was not
[50:03] happy that that that Abel got a
[50:06] breakthrough. Cain was not happy that
[50:08] that that that Abel's sacrifice was
[50:10] answered. Wouldn't you just say we're
[50:12] back in church there? I know there's
[50:13] only two of them, but just imagine we're
[50:14] all there, you know, and you know, and
[50:16] and it's a prayer meeting and then so
[50:19] Abel's praying and God just comes down,
[50:21] anoints his prayer, he gets a real
[50:23] breakthrough, the answer comes.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't we be happy about that? You
[50:28] know, heaven answered a worship. Heaven
[50:30] responded, God responded back. This is
[50:32] incredible. Cain wasn't happy about
[50:34] this. He was upset. He's like, "Well,
[50:36] what about me?" Here I am. Instead of
[50:39] rallying around God's provider way of
[50:41] worship that that that Abel had the
[50:43] revelation for, he was offended.
[50:46] And then he kills, you know, he, you
[50:48] know, he kills um Abel and all those
[50:51] things. But what did he perceive himself
[50:53] as? A victim.
[50:55] This is not my fault. I'm doing this.
[50:58] This is totally outside of my control.
[51:00] And he had reasoning. He wasn't a robot.
[51:03] He could think. He watched it happen. He
[51:05] would have felt, this is just me, would
[51:07] have felt the presence of the Lord come
[51:08] and anoint Abel's life. He would have
[51:11] seen the response that, you know, the
[51:13] manifestation of when God came down and
[51:15] received that sacrifice. He would have
[51:17] heard the hallelujah. He would have seen
[51:18] a change in Abel's countenance. He would
[51:21] have seen God, you know, the victory
[51:23] come and he would have seen all those
[51:24] things. But he wasn't happy about it.
[51:29] And he said, well, this is just But you
[51:30] see, then he had to reason. Well, and
[51:32] then God even came to him just said
[51:34] flat. Just do like your brother did. It
[51:36] worked for him. It'll work for you
[51:38] because God's door's open to everyone.
[51:40] He doesn't close his door of mercy to
[51:42] anybody. It's open to everyone. No
[51:44] matter how bad whatever it doesn't pass
[51:47] doesn't matter. It really doesn't
[51:49] matter. None of that comes into God's
[51:51] account. You see? And so God even said
[51:53] just do like your brother did. Didn't
[51:55] even have to Abel. I mean Cain, you
[51:57] don't even need to understand what's
[51:59] going on here. Just do like your brother
[52:01] did and you'll be accepted. Oh, but I'm
[52:03] the victim. Poor me. And this is this is
[52:05] your fault and this is not mine. And
[52:07] then he ends up murdering his brother.
[52:08] And what happens? He gets marked by God
[52:10] and leaves the presence of God.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; He's just a he's just a big it's like a
[52:15] big cosmic accident and now he's a
[52:17] victim. No, he planned it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; He he he received God's word in his mind
[52:21] and rejected it and then acted
[52:23] accordingly.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; So who's the victim here? Yeah,
[52:29] &gt;&gt; it's not okay. But if we we can get into
[52:30] a victim mentality. Oh, I come to
[52:32] church, too. Why doesn't God bless my
[52:34] life? And why doesn't God do this for
[52:36] me? And it's not fair. And no, we should
[52:38] rally around answered prayer. We should
[52:41] rally around victory. We should
[52:43] celebrate it. We should c We should be
[52:45] the biggest cheerleader for one another.
[52:47] Praise the Lord. You're a victorious
[52:49] believer. You're going to make it. Amen.
[52:51] God's God's found you. I'm so thankful
[52:54] God answers prayer. I'm so glad I can
[52:56] see Calvary works.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I'm happy about this. That the blood
[53:01] does what it says it would do. That it
[53:03] would cleanse the people. That the Holy
[53:05] Spirit of God can dwell in those people.
[53:07] I'm so thankful I can stand up here
[53:09] every Sunday and look at the effects of
[53:11] Calvary.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So maybe I should
[53:16] get some pom poms. You know, you see,
[53:18] I'm happy about it. I'm happy about what
[53:21] God does. I'm not offended. I don't get
[53:24] annoyed or oh that's not fair. What
[53:26] about me? No, I'm not a victim.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe any of us are victim
[53:32] mentality, but it wants to try and get
[53:33] in somewhere
[53:35] because remember we're in this world,
[53:37] but we're not of this world. But this
[53:38] world wants to get into you. Right? So
[53:40] we we are living in Lady Oia. The
[53:42] world's in Lady Oia, but we're in a
[53:44] bride age, but we're still in this
[53:46] world. Right? So, we've got to be very
[53:48] aware that, you know, we can't let the
[53:50] the spirit of this age, this this victim
[53:53] mentality, this entitlement spirit come
[53:56] and rob us of our victory in Christ
[53:59] because it wants to. I say, you know,
[54:01] this is a great country. I agree,
[54:02] brother Isaac. Absolutely. But it is the
[54:05] epitome of Lady Oia. But we should take
[54:07] what we have and use it for the kingdom
[54:09] of God. Right. But this is the epitome.
[54:11] This this country is the epitome of Lady
[54:13] Oia. Everyone wants their rights and
[54:15] everyone's rising up and feeling
[54:16] entitled and victim mentality and victim
[54:19] of all kind of things and everyone's a
[54:21] victim. We aren't a victim.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; We are not a victim. No. If if God has
[54:26] found you, if this message has spoken to
[54:28] your life, quicken that seed on the
[54:30] inside, change your life. You're not a
[54:32] victim.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we should look at life
[54:35] in a different matter and say, "No, I'm
[54:37] not a victim. Oh, the world's falling
[54:39] apart. I'm just a victim of a economic
[54:41] collapse." No, we're not a victim of it.
[54:44] Just like the widow woman at Zeraphat,
[54:46] she was not a victim. God sent Elijah to
[54:48] her house and she and her son were
[54:50] sustained. I mean, through that whole
[54:52] drought, God looked after them because
[54:54] she looked after the word. I tell you
[54:56] what, you take care of the living word
[54:57] of God and God will sustain you. Amen.
[55:00] Not just spiritually, but naturally,
[55:02] he'll take care of you. I mean, you may
[55:03] have to go through some testing times,
[55:05] but God is just developing character in
[55:07] your life that you can rest in
[55:09] everything that's going on cuz God is
[55:11] using it for your good. Amen. It's not
[55:13] that your bank balance gets good or you
[55:14] get a bunch of big flash shiny things.
[55:17] It's that your character is developed.
[55:19] Amen. We're going through a developing
[55:21] process. So, every trial, we're not a
[55:23] victim of trials. No, we are the
[55:26] beneficiary of trials. We're the
[55:28] beneficiary of hardship. We're the
[55:30] beneficiary of trouble and anguish and
[55:32] trouble. We get the benefits out of it
[55:34] and those benefits are not complexes,
[55:36] pains or hurts. No, those those benefits
[55:39] are character
[55:41] &gt;&gt; or is character if that's better
[55:42] English. I don't know. Amen. I wish it
[55:44] was my second language. I can say I
[55:45] speak it in self-defense. But anyway,
[55:47] you see, we are not victims.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; We are not victims.
[55:54] Amen. Now, Cain would Kane would have
[55:57] this mentality. Then we then we would
[55:59] see here this painting is about Judas
[56:01] and he's and he's discussing with the
[56:03] high priest and so on the value of of
[56:05] the Lord Jesus. Now if you look at uh
[56:08] Judas he did not end up this way. I mean
[56:10] he did not sorry he ended up this way.
[56:12] He didn't start this way. He would have
[56:14] been caught up in wow the Messiah is
[56:16] upon the earth. This man is God in flesh
[56:18] and look at the miracles he's doing and
[56:20] look how great he is. And look I'm in
[56:22] the inner I'm in the inner circle man.
[56:23] I'm not just some guy in the back. I'm
[56:25] one of the 12 disciples. He called me.
[56:28] [snorts] I didn't join myself to him. I
[56:30] wasn't looking for him. He was looking
[56:31] for me. I mean, just like the message of
[56:33] the hour came looking for you. Amen.
[56:35] Messiah, you weren't looking for the
[56:37] Messiah. The Messiah was looking for
[56:38] you. And what he looks for, he finds and
[56:41] keeps. Amen. But you see now, so Judas,
[56:44] Judas would Judas would start off this
[56:46] way, but then he began to find himself
[56:49] in a victim mentality where the where
[56:52] the external where he became a victim of
[56:55] really misunderstanding
[56:58] because he came to a point in his life
[57:00] where he where he where he thought
[57:02] selling the Lord for 30 pieces of silver
[57:05] was greater value than keeping the
[57:07] Messiah. Now he would he would come to a
[57:09] point where he would blame the Lord
[57:12] Jesus and the other other disciples for
[57:15] for the state he found himself in. He he
[57:18] he felt himself he was pushed into a
[57:20] corner. Now a victim mentality comes
[57:24] there's normally underlying conditions
[57:27] right? There's always an underlying
[57:28] condition that will bring forth a victim
[57:30] mentality. It's never just it in itself.
[57:33] There's always something that it
[57:34] attaches itself to. Now we understand
[57:37] from the scripture where John would John
[57:39] would speak about it that that that
[57:41] Judas Judas was a thief. This was the
[57:44] underlying condition. So when he joined
[57:47] the Lord Jesus, he he he saw the
[57:49] benefits. Yes, he's the Messiah, but
[57:51] what can I get out of this? How can this
[57:53] feather my nest? How can this benefit
[57:55] me? And so so so Jesus now would be
[57:58] anointed by Mary. This is before the
[58:01] crucifixion and so on. And you know
[58:04] Judas Judas was actually uh in in other
[58:07] accounts you read about it. Um he is the
[58:10] one who says this is such a waste. He
[58:12] was offended at this. He thought man
[58:15] this this lady is spending what what a
[58:17] waste of time and and money cuz he says
[58:21] why would this o not this ointment be
[58:23] sold for 300 p and given to the poor. So
[58:27] he saw the value of what she was going
[58:29] to pour upon him. She did. He did not
[58:31] see the value of what she was doing. And
[58:33] even the Lord Jesus would sit there for
[58:35] a moment and say, "No, she's done this
[58:37] for my burial." Amen. So, so he actually
[58:40] got a revelation after, you know, while
[58:42] she was anointing him that that that she
[58:44] was anointing the Lord Jesus for the
[58:46] next part of his ministry. Wouldn't it
[58:48] be wonderful, friends, if our praise
[58:49] would anoint the word for the next part
[58:51] of what he's about to do? Amen. That
[58:53] that that this that you know that that
[58:55] our lives that we've given to him and
[58:57] our praise, our adoration, Amen. would
[58:59] anoint the living word. Amen. For what
[59:01] he's about to do. Well, what is he going
[59:03] to do next? While the dead in Christ are
[59:04] going to raise. I mean, before that, the
[59:06] prodals are coming home. I mean, God's
[59:08] going to God's going to fill this place.
[59:10] That's just my conviction. That's what I
[59:11] feel. I mean, but but but the wayward
[59:13] are going to come. You know, the hedges
[59:15] and highways, they're going to come out
[59:16] of those places. You know, this is what
[59:18] I'm believing for, you know. So, so why
[59:20] not anoint the Lord? Anoint the word for
[59:22] what he's about to do next. Give him
[59:24] praise. Amen. For it. So, but but Judas
[59:28] didn't see the value of what she was
[59:29] doing. He only saw the value in what she
[59:33] was wasting because he was the thief.
[59:36] It's interesting that it's only in the
[59:38] Gospel of John, that eagle anointing
[59:40] that um that that that actually
[59:42] identifies Judas being a thief.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; See that? See God, we can't hide
[59:46] anything from the Lord. He sees the
[59:49] underlying condition. He sees the state
[59:51] we're in. Right? So, now here here he
[59:53] is. He's offended. Uh then then then he
[59:56] thinks, man, this is and then he saw the
[59:58] rejection the Lord was, you know, cuz at
[1:00:00] first look at this young rabbi, how
[1:00:02] wonderful it is. Look what he's doing.
[1:00:04] But then he begins to reveal himself. He
[1:00:06] opens the scripture. He, you know,
[1:00:08] begins to uh preach preach the truth of
[1:00:11] the word. He saw the following of the
[1:00:13] Lord. Jesus was going down and down and
[1:00:16] down. And so he got to a point where he
[1:00:18] thought, "Man, I have joined up with the
[1:00:20] wrong cause. I am now a victim of this
[1:00:23] man's charisma, of the supernatural. I
[1:00:25] can't explain what he's doing, but I've
[1:00:27] become a victim of, you know, this man
[1:00:30] is just drawing me in. And so, what did
[1:00:32] he do now with this victim mentality? He
[1:00:34] used it to betray the Lord Jesus. Now,
[1:00:39] this is the this is the after after this
[1:00:41] because the Lord Jesus would say, "Let
[1:00:43] her alone against the day of my bearing
[1:00:45] hath she kept this." So he actually he
[1:00:47] actually corrects Judas in his thinking
[1:00:49] saying this is not a waste but this is
[1:00:51] actually a good thing he's um she has
[1:00:54] done to me. So he he got offended by
[1:00:57] this. We must never be offended by the
[1:00:59] word when it corrects our lives. We say
[1:01:00] thank you Lord Jesus. It may it may tear
[1:01:03] high strips off our back. It may skin us
[1:01:06] till there's no skin no more. Thank you
[1:01:07] Lord. Appreciate that. I you know I need
[1:01:10] that correction. Right? We must never
[1:01:12] become like Judas and be offended. And
[1:01:14] so what did he do? He began to blame the
[1:01:16] Lord Jesus for for the state he found
[1:01:18] himself in. Because if you think about
[1:01:21] uh the day he lived in in order to
[1:01:24] follow the Lord, he had to forsake
[1:01:26] everything.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He wasn't allowed in the synagogues
[1:01:29] anymore. His name, he had a he had a
[1:01:31] black mark against his name. Everyone
[1:01:34] knew who he was because of his
[1:01:35] association. It wasn't like in, you
[1:01:37] know, this country you can go to this
[1:01:39] church and change to that church and
[1:01:41] there's not really a big upheaval.
[1:01:42] You're not or you're not ostracized from
[1:01:45] society because you change your church.
[1:01:47] But in that day, oh my different kind of
[1:01:50] a different kind of a culture going on.
[1:01:52] It was a big deal to say that man is the
[1:01:55] Messiah when all the religious leaders
[1:01:57] are saying he is be elabub. So he had he
[1:02:01] he he
[1:02:03] was happy to take on that reproach. But
[1:02:05] then he began to see now I'm a victim.
[1:02:07] I'm painting a picture here. Okay, as
[1:02:08] you can see, Judas came to her, but the
[1:02:10] underlying cause was he is a thief. But
[1:02:13] what happened is a a victim mentality
[1:02:15] came out. He didn't take responsibility
[1:02:17] for his choices. He began to blame. And
[1:02:20] then so right after this, right after
[1:02:22] this where where um the Lord Jesus
[1:02:25] corrects him about Mary anointing him,
[1:02:28] what does he do? Then one of the 12
[1:02:30] called Judas of Escariat went unto the
[1:02:32] other chief priests uh sorry went unto
[1:02:35] the chief priests and said unto them,
[1:02:37] "What will you give me?" And uh that I
[1:02:39] will deliver him unto you. And they
[1:02:42] coveted with him 30 pieces of silver.
[1:02:44] And from that time he sought opportunity
[1:02:47] to betray him. You see, someone with a
[1:02:49] victim mentality is not loyal.
[1:02:52] Judas's loyalty was to money. That was
[1:02:54] his underlying condition. He was more
[1:02:56] interested in what he can get more than
[1:02:58] the Messiah fulfilling the word. So he
[1:03:01] was offended. And this is why you got to
[1:03:02] be careful. Where do offenses take you?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You got to be very careful because we
[1:03:07] will offend one another. And we probably
[1:03:09] have offended each one of us, all of us
[1:03:11] equally, right? Some more than others,
[1:03:15] but we're human,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; you know. So, so what do we do with our
[1:03:19] offenses? Do we do we do we build a
[1:03:22] complex? Nobody likes me. I got no
[1:03:24] friends. or I'm just a victim of this my
[1:03:27] upbringing or I have to come here or
[1:03:28] whatever more or do we take those
[1:03:30] offenses to the Lord and say, "Father,
[1:03:33] forgive them. They don't know what they
[1:03:34] do. They're human like me, Lord."
[1:03:36] Because we know that if we take people
[1:03:37] in before the presence of God, God can
[1:03:40] maybe begin to speak to us and tell us
[1:03:41] the reason they're that way. And once we
[1:03:43] get down after that prayer, we come down
[1:03:45] from the presence of God, we feel sorry
[1:03:47] for that person. Now, that's a quote,
[1:03:49] right? We you know we feel genuinely
[1:03:51] sorry for that person and we love them
[1:03:52] all the more because we have
[1:03:54] understanding why they are the way they
[1:03:56] are because God has shown us. Aren't you
[1:03:58] glad God can do that?
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can actually give us a give us
[1:04:02] an insight that we can actually have a
[1:04:03] feeling one for another instead of a
[1:04:06] push away.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; So this was Judas's this was Judas's um
[1:04:12] this was Judas's uh plan. Now after the
[1:04:14] betrayal, after he had betrayed the Lord
[1:04:17] Jesus and and and taken the arm men to
[1:04:19] take him in the garden, you know, he
[1:04:21] would he would take that he would take
[1:04:22] that 30 pieces of silver and he would
[1:04:25] take it he would take it back to back to
[1:04:27] them.
[1:04:30] And what did he do? He says, "I have
[1:04:31] betrayed innocent blood."
[1:04:34] And they said, "What is that to us?
[1:04:36] That's your problem. Are you going to
[1:04:38] take responsibility for what you've done
[1:04:40] or are you just going to see, you know,
[1:04:42] what are you going to do about this?
[1:04:43] Now, there is nowhere in the scripture
[1:04:44] that, you know, you know, before Judas
[1:04:47] hung himself where, you know, I believe
[1:04:49] if you know, I believe if Judas now hung
[1:04:53] around till Pentecost,
[1:04:56] God's mercy is great.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus called him a devil, well,
[1:04:59] there's even but he's still a human
[1:05:01] being,
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; right? I just think God's grace is big.
[1:05:05] There's room for everybody who wants to
[1:05:07] come.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; There's no exclusions anywhere. Amen.
[1:05:10] This is just how I feel cuz he found me.
[1:05:13] That's just how I feel. Right? But you
[1:05:15] see Judas now, he began to blame. He
[1:05:17] says, "Well, I betrayed innocent blood.
[1:05:19] I'm a victim of a whole big
[1:05:21] misunderstanding." But he didn't take it
[1:05:23] on himself as a responsibility. He just
[1:05:25] blamed the whole condition he found
[1:05:27] himself in. He externalized the blame.
[1:05:29] We must always take responsibility for
[1:05:31] our actions. I mean, we can't blame
[1:05:34] someone else for the reason we are how
[1:05:35] we are, right? We need to very much own
[1:05:38] it for ourselves. You say, "My
[1:05:40] upbringing was terrible, but what have
[1:05:42] you done with that upbringing? Have you
[1:05:44] allowed it to make you a better person?
[1:05:47] Or has it shaped you in a very negative
[1:05:49] way and now you stay that way and now
[1:05:52] you're a victim of how you were raised?"
[1:05:54] You know, I've never seen a little kid
[1:05:56] like you go like when William was a
[1:05:58] preschool. You know, you go into the
[1:05:59] preschool or the girls, you know, you go
[1:06:01] into a preschool, you see a little
[1:06:02] toddler there, you know, hello, how are
[1:06:04] you, all happy, bubbly, you know, I
[1:06:08] don't see any kid that that's more of
[1:06:10] the victim mentality. Oh, life's not
[1:06:12] fair and this is wrong, you know. But
[1:06:14] but upbringing and time shape people a
[1:06:17] certain way,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; I think.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're overcomers. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; We need to make peace with where we came
[1:06:27] from,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; who we are,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; our nature, our upbringing, how much
[1:06:34] money we have or don't have.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; We need to make peace with those things.
[1:06:38] Say, "God, you wanted a certain thing.
[1:06:41] You want a certain sound in my life. I'm
[1:06:43] a custommade job. I'm one of a kind. And
[1:06:47] and God, you didn't make me with any
[1:06:50] defects."
[1:06:52] Praise the Lord. I wasn't I wasn't just
[1:06:54] a you know broke the mold and they threw
[1:06:56] the mold away and they you know you know
[1:06:59] none of us are born with a disability
[1:07:02] a spiritual disability right none of us
[1:07:05] are born with that God wants to use us
[1:07:08] as we've been made a victim of our
[1:07:12] upbringing I feel to just go down this
[1:07:14] avenue because this can be it's amazing
[1:07:16] how a few years can shape a person for
[1:07:18] the rest of their life and they're still
[1:07:19] looking back with a with I think a wrong
[1:07:22] view Many times our parents were all
[1:07:25] human.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; If we're human, therefore they made
[1:07:29] mistakes. They said things wrong. They
[1:07:31] could have done things a better way
[1:07:32] because we're human, right? But we can't
[1:07:36] change the past.
[1:07:39] We can't be a victim of how we were
[1:07:41] raised because when the Lord Jesus comes
[1:07:43] in, he wants to give us a new identity.
[1:07:45] He wants to give us a different
[1:07:47] thinking. He wants to give us a new
[1:07:49] outlook where we can look back and say,
[1:07:50] "Lord Jesus, everything has worked for
[1:07:53] my good."
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Everything, even the bad things, worked
[1:07:57] for my good. Moses could stand there and
[1:08:00] say, "The time in Pharaoh's palace
[1:08:02] worked for my good." The time back side
[1:08:05] of the desert was working for my good.
[1:08:07] Those 40 years in the desert raising his
[1:08:09] father-in-law's sheep with a
[1:08:10] hightempered wife, that was working for
[1:08:12] his good.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God was shaping him a
[1:08:16] certain way.
[1:08:17] God shapes us a certain way.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't have to take 80 years
[1:08:21] for God to get us into condition to
[1:08:23] speak to us, right? Amen. But we got to
[1:08:25] realize everything that's happened in
[1:08:26] life is is for our good.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm going to we're
[1:08:31] going to make a shift here soon. But you
[1:08:34] see
[1:08:35] um
[1:08:39] the Lord Jesus gave us this promise.
[1:08:41] Behold, I stand the door and knock. If
[1:08:42] any man hear my voice, open the door. I
[1:08:44] will come into him and will suffer with
[1:08:46] him and he with me. To him that
[1:08:48] overcomemeth will I grant it sit with me
[1:08:49] in my throne. Even also as I also
[1:08:52] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:08:54] his throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[1:08:56] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:08:58] churches. Now before these verses
[1:09:00] there's a there's the uh uh the lord
[1:09:03] Jesus is describing the age of ladosia
[1:09:06] which means people's rights. So this is
[1:09:08] or or um justice of the people is what
[1:09:10] ladosia means. Now what has happened is
[1:09:13] this is the condition the world is in is
[1:09:15] a lady condition. It's more than a
[1:09:17] lukewarmness. It's more than rich
[1:09:20] increase with goods. It's a feeling of
[1:09:21] entitlement and a victim mentality.
[1:09:25] Right? You look at politics. You look at
[1:09:27] you know uh identity politics any kind
[1:09:29] of way. Even even people protest over
[1:09:31] climate change. Young people do cuz
[1:09:33] they're saying that our future's been
[1:09:35] robbed from us because of the prosperity
[1:09:37] of our parents.
[1:09:40] Right? Look at look at the world's
[1:09:42] nature's falling apart. We're a victim
[1:09:44] of technology. Look at what's happened.
[1:09:46] And and what it's a victim mentality
[1:09:48] that our future's taken from us because
[1:09:51] of what's happened in the past. This is
[1:09:52] just on an environmental level. Isn't
[1:09:55] that right? There's a climate change
[1:09:56] anxiety is a real thing. It's actually a
[1:09:59] psychological disorder where young
[1:10:01] people get so anxious about nature
[1:10:03] falling apart and pollution and all
[1:10:06] these things. Now, what have they done?
[1:10:08] They've taken on a victim mentality, but
[1:10:11] it's been preached to them. It's been
[1:10:12] it's been put upon them. You're a victim
[1:10:15] of what industrial industrialization has
[1:10:19] done. And this came out very much even
[1:10:21] before the environmental issue when when
[1:10:23] when the social gospel came to the
[1:10:26] forefront. Now, I used to think the
[1:10:27] social gospel, brother Brandon speaks
[1:10:29] against it, is that the social gospel is
[1:10:31] basically just be a good person, be kind
[1:10:34] to one another. It's like a watered down
[1:10:36] gospel. And it is a watered down gospel.
[1:10:38] But a social gospel is where the
[1:10:40] pulpit's used to preach about social
[1:10:42] issues and social justice as opposed to
[1:10:45] preaching the word of God that can
[1:10:47] transform a life. I mean that's the
[1:10:49] social gospel where where whatever is
[1:10:51] trending in the world can be a trouble
[1:10:52] or injustice in just in culture. The
[1:10:55] pulpit becomes a platform to speak
[1:10:57] against those things. And so it actually
[1:11:00] dilutes or actually moves the gospel
[1:11:02] from a place where people can be born
[1:11:04] again. They can meet the living God.
[1:11:06] They can be transformed. God can change
[1:11:08] their lives to just talking about social
[1:11:10] issues.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; This is what the social gospel and this
[1:11:14] is what has permeated this generation
[1:11:16] from the 50s even earlier than that all
[1:11:19] the way to 2026. That's a long time.
[1:11:22] That's 86 years if my math is near
[1:11:24] close. I don't know. But you know that's
[1:11:26] a long time. That's like three
[1:11:28] generations you could have in that span
[1:11:30] easy.
[1:11:31] And so now the the pulpit has been
[1:11:34] changed to just preach about social
[1:11:36] things.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But where is the true power of God?
[1:11:40] Brother Ram says the problem is it's not
[1:11:41] the politicians that are the problem.
[1:11:43] It's weak pulpits.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Because if the gospel was preached in
[1:11:47] power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:11:49] Ghost where actually you can be
[1:11:50] transformed where God can get a hold of
[1:11:53] your life and live in you like he did in
[1:11:54] the Bible days. Amen. Then what would
[1:11:56] that do? That would shut down every
[1:11:58] beard joint. It would remove a victim
[1:12:01] mentality. Amen. Entitlement would not
[1:12:03] be how it is today where people just
[1:12:06] want to get all that because entitlement
[1:12:07] is is is a feeling of special treatment
[1:12:11] based on gender, race, whatever it is.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; We aren't called to live under that
[1:12:16] entitlement.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Man was never made to live with an
[1:12:20] entitlement selfish motive and attitude.
[1:12:23] All that has done is degraded people
[1:12:25] around the world. Sadly, the the social
[1:12:27] gospel has ruined people, ruined whole
[1:12:30] demographics of people. And but the
[1:12:32] thing is, we are not called to live
[1:12:34] under that.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I trust you're with me today.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure, we should speak about what's
[1:12:40] going on in the world, but we're not
[1:12:41] here to further some social cause. We're
[1:12:44] here to further God living in a people.
[1:12:47] As brother Bram said that his ministry
[1:12:49] was here to make powerhouses of the Holy
[1:12:51] Ghost. Amen. Statues of the living God.
[1:12:55] Amen. The full you know the full stature
[1:12:58] of God. The statue of the perfect man is
[1:13:00] a living God living in a living people.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now so so here is so
[1:13:06] this is a this is the case we find
[1:13:08] ourselves in. Now there are people in
[1:13:10] the scripture that did not have a victim
[1:13:13] mentality even though they had every
[1:13:15] reason to have it. And I'm going to
[1:13:17] start with one. To me, this is this is
[1:13:19] the greatest one is when we speak about
[1:13:22] Jonathan and Saul.
[1:13:26] Speak about Jonathan and Saul. Now, Saul
[1:13:30] Saul died sadly on the battlefield.
[1:13:32] Jonathan with him because he he had a
[1:13:35] jealousy. The underlying condition in
[1:13:37] his life, he had a jealous heart. He had
[1:13:40] an inferiority complex because the
[1:13:42] scripture says, I don't have it here, is
[1:13:44] that is that Saul was from the smallest
[1:13:46] family in the smallest tribe. But yet
[1:13:48] the Bible says that his father Kish was
[1:13:50] a mighty man of power. Amen. So but but
[1:13:53] this was and even Saul was head and
[1:13:54] shoulders above the rest of Israel. But
[1:13:56] see, he was he he allowed his his his
[1:14:00] station in life, the smallest family,
[1:14:02] the smallest tribe. Look how little I
[1:14:04] am. This is his perception that he was a
[1:14:07] victim. that he thought that God just
[1:14:09] set him up to fail. I tell you, God did
[1:14:12] not set Saul up to fail. It was it was
[1:14:14] Saul's complexes that set Saul up to
[1:14:16] fail because God even um I don't know if
[1:14:19] I have it here, but even God told him
[1:14:21] when when when Samuel came to actually
[1:14:24] tell tell uh tell Saul that the
[1:14:26] kingdom's taken from you. Samuel said to
[1:14:29] Saul, "If you just obeyed what God said
[1:14:31] to do, I would have established your
[1:14:33] kingdom forever." Amen. So So God God
[1:14:36] didn't set Saul up to fail. It was
[1:14:37] Saul's perceived victim mentality.
[1:14:40] Everyone else is at fault. Oh, the
[1:14:42] people made me worship early and the
[1:14:44] people did this and the, you know,
[1:14:46] blaming everyone else. Instead of
[1:14:47] instead of actually taking the
[1:14:48] responsibility upon himself, I am king.
[1:14:51] I have the final say. I've been anointed
[1:14:53] by God for this position. You see what
[1:14:55] did he and then so he never wanted the
[1:14:57] kingship. Now, this is after Samuel had
[1:14:59] anointed him and told him he's king. And
[1:15:01] then so Samuel gathers all the tribes of
[1:15:04] Israel to come and the tribe of Benjamin
[1:15:06] was taken. Now they're casting lots to
[1:15:08] see who's going to be king. Then finally
[1:15:09] it whittleles down to to Benjamin. Then
[1:15:12] it came to Kish. And then and and then
[1:15:14] the lots came to to Saul. But he wasn't
[1:15:18] found anywhere. What was he doing? He
[1:15:20] was hiding in the baggage. He was hiding
[1:15:22] away because he knew the whole reason
[1:15:25] for this gathering was that he would be
[1:15:26] publicly anointed king. But he was
[1:15:28] running from the very call of God. And
[1:15:31] so this would have now this is just me
[1:15:33] because I like to kind of think about
[1:15:34] how people would think here because you
[1:15:36] know the Bible characters are like you
[1:15:38] and I. So Saul Saul started off with
[1:15:41] this reluctance. I don't want to be
[1:15:43] king. You know now now what is he
[1:15:45] saying? You know he becomes this thought
[1:15:48] in his mind as he's just a victim of
[1:15:50] God. You've set me up to fail God. Look
[1:15:53] at this. It's your fault. He had a
[1:15:55] jealous heart and all these things. And
[1:15:57] so what did he do? Is he is he because
[1:15:59] of jealousy and because of because of
[1:16:02] this victim mentality that came into his
[1:16:04] life, he blamed everyone else for why
[1:16:07] God left him as opposed to taking the
[1:16:10] responsibility. Now, if he was if he was
[1:16:13] not like this, he would have been like
[1:16:16] David. He would have been a man after
[1:16:17] God's own heart. Now,
[1:16:20] there was someone in his family who was
[1:16:22] a man after God's own heart as well,
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; and that was Jonathan. Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:29] Amen. He He would He did not live. You
[1:16:32] think about here's a man I I don't know
[1:16:34] if I have the scripture here. I think I
[1:16:35] do. But yes. So So David I mean I mean
[1:16:39] Samuel would tell Saul, "Thy kingdom
[1:16:41] shall not continue. The Lord hath sought
[1:16:43] him a man after his own heart."
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And and so now here is here is Jonathan.
[1:16:51] He's the He's the crown prince of
[1:16:53] Israel. By right, just by time going on
[1:16:57] long enough, he would become king of
[1:16:58] Israel. But you see what happened is
[1:17:01] because of the choices of his father,
[1:17:03] the kingdom was taken from him where he
[1:17:06] had now no chance at all to be God's
[1:17:08] anointed king of Israel. If there was
[1:17:10] someone who could have blamed others and
[1:17:13] and and developed a uh victim mentality,
[1:17:16] it would have been Jonathan.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; This is not my fault. that's his fault.
[1:17:21] Why do I have to be punished for
[1:17:22] something my father did and look at his
[1:17:24] choices and look at what he's done and
[1:17:26] this is all wrong and I'm just a victim
[1:17:28] and everything goes wrong for me in my
[1:17:29] life. He could have developed that but
[1:17:32] he chose not to.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; He chose not to develop that kind of
[1:17:35] complex. And what did he do? He actually
[1:17:38] was rejoicing knowing that his friend
[1:17:40] David would be king. And I think this is
[1:17:43] the greatest thing where where we can we
[1:17:46] can come to a point in our lives that we
[1:17:49] don't feel sorry for ourselves as God
[1:17:51] chooses someone above us that we're
[1:17:53] happy with whoever God uses. Praise God.
[1:17:56] Amen. You think about Saul a right kind
[1:17:59] of a heart. And Sam, now this is just
[1:18:00] me. If I was Saul and God told me, you
[1:18:03] can't you can't be king. I'd be okay.
[1:18:06] I'm going to set this up
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; for when that man comes along. It's
[1:18:10] going to be easy for him. I'm going to
[1:18:12] do all I can that this kingdom can be
[1:18:16] can be a smooth transition. There's no
[1:18:19] civil war. There's no fighting among the
[1:18:21] churches. There's no fighting among the
[1:18:23] tribes. You know, I would I would set it
[1:18:26] up, wouldn't you?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Because you see, God is God's plan is
[1:18:30] unfolding. And and I might be not part
[1:18:33] of the next phase of his plan, but I'm
[1:18:35] going to do all I can to build a
[1:18:36] platform that when that man arrives,
[1:18:39] he's going to be on the throne. It's
[1:18:40] going to be easy. But Saul wasn't like
[1:18:43] that cuz he had a victim mentality. This
[1:18:45] is not fair. Well is me. What about me?
[1:18:49] But Jonathan wasn't that way.
[1:18:52] Jonathan, the man who should have had a
[1:18:54] victim mentality, had integrity. Amen.
[1:18:57] He wasn't He wasn't caught up in He
[1:18:59] wasn't caught up in the the victim
[1:19:02] mentality of his father. He was his own
[1:19:04] man. Amen. And what did he do? He was he
[1:19:07] was a friend of David.
[1:19:09] and and he even saw said to so so let's
[1:19:12] just read this and David saw that Saul
[1:19:15] was come out to seek his life and David
[1:19:17] was in the wilderness of of Ze in a in a
[1:19:20] wood and Jonathan Saul's son arose and
[1:19:22] went to David into the wood and
[1:19:23] strengthened his hand in God so here's
[1:19:26] someone someone who doesn't have a
[1:19:28] victim mentality strengthens the hands
[1:19:30] of those around them I mean they want to
[1:19:32] lift up those who are going through
[1:19:34] something you see David was in a great
[1:19:35] transition where he was in the throne
[1:19:37] room he could have stepped on the throne
[1:19:39] But God had to get him out into the
[1:19:40] wilderness on the run. All kinds of
[1:19:42] trouble to develop his character. And so
[1:19:44] David's going through a great transition
[1:19:46] in his life. And what does Jonathan do?
[1:19:48] He strengthens his hands. Amen. I think
[1:19:50] this is what we should do to all of us.
[1:19:52] Amen. Those going through teen teenage
[1:19:54] years, we strengthen their hands. Those
[1:19:56] are going through menopause, we
[1:19:57] strengthen their hands. Those who at the
[1:19:59] end of their life, we strengthen their
[1:20:01] hands. Their babies, whatever age,
[1:20:03] whatever transition people are going
[1:20:04] through, we strengthen their hands in
[1:20:06] the Lord. Amen. saying, "God has
[1:20:08] ordained you to go through these
[1:20:09] things." I mean, God has allowed it. He
[1:20:11] isn't angry at you. He's not bitter.
[1:20:12] He's not He's not resentful. No, he
[1:20:14] loves you with unfailing love. And God
[1:20:16] will see you through every stage of your
[1:20:18] life.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said unto him, "Fear not, for
[1:20:22] the hand of Saul my father shall not
[1:20:24] find thee, and thou shalt be king over
[1:20:26] Israel, and I shall be next unto thee,
[1:20:29] and that also Saul my father knoweth."
[1:20:31] And they too made a covenant before the
[1:20:33] Lord. And David abodeed in the wood and
[1:20:36] Jonathan went to his house. So Jonathan
[1:20:40] knew this would be the kind of the thing
[1:20:41] that was going to go on.
[1:20:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Just trying to find where I am.
[1:20:48] See, [snorts] he had every opportunity.
[1:20:51] He had every opportunity to to to have a
[1:20:55] victim mentality. But what did he do? He
[1:20:58] said, "No, you're going to be king. I'm
[1:21:00] going to strengthen your hands. this has
[1:21:02] passed from me out of out of things
[1:21:04] completely out of my control, but you're
[1:21:07] going to be king and you're my friend
[1:21:10] and I'm gladly going to step aside to
[1:21:12] let you in.
[1:21:14] Praise the Lord. You see, Jonathan was a
[1:21:17] man after God's own heart like David.
[1:21:19] Because anyone who's a man after God's
[1:21:21] own heart wants to see the word of God
[1:21:23] go forward. And it's not out of a out of
[1:21:26] a selfish motive. They just want to see
[1:21:28] God's kingdom expand. They're not
[1:21:30] interested whether they get used or not.
[1:21:31] They just want to see God's word unfold.
[1:21:33] They just want to see people come to
[1:21:35] their position in Christ. They want to
[1:21:37] see an adopted church. Amen. That's what
[1:21:39] they want to see. Amen. So, David, David
[1:21:41] was I mean, Jonathan was like a like a
[1:21:44] like a twin to David and the fact he was
[1:21:46] a man after God's own heart. Amen. And
[1:21:49] he was he was he even, you know, he was
[1:21:52] not angry, but he was said happy that
[1:21:54] his friend was going to become king. And
[1:21:56] but someone who's a victim mentality is
[1:21:58] if they aren't number one, they get
[1:21:59] angry, they get upset. Now, I think the
[1:22:02] reason for this is because he could
[1:22:04] identify. It's amazing with Jonathan. I
[1:22:06] don't think there's any instance in the
[1:22:07] scripture says he was anointed by God,
[1:22:09] that God moved in his life. Sure, he did
[1:22:11] mighty exploits with faith. But you see,
[1:22:14] I don't think there's any instance where
[1:22:15] the anointing was upon him, but
[1:22:18] something something in his life could
[1:22:19] recognize the word in front of him.
[1:22:22] Amen. Because David was the beginning
[1:22:24] was the beginning of this scripture
[1:22:26] where where the blessing would come upon
[1:22:28] the tribes and and and and one of the
[1:22:30] blessings speaking of Judah was the
[1:22:31] scepter shall not depart from Judah nor
[1:22:33] a lawgiver from between his feet until
[1:22:36] Shiloh come. That speaks of the Messiah.
[1:22:38] And unto him shall the gathering of the
[1:22:40] people be. So, so Jonathan somehow knew
[1:22:43] that the kingship, could you imagine
[1:22:44] that? You've been made king. You're in
[1:22:46] the tribe of Benjamin.
[1:22:48] You know eventually the kingship's going
[1:22:50] to is going to go to another What kind
[1:22:52] of person are you going to be? Are you
[1:22:53] going to be like Saul saying, "No, this
[1:22:55] is mine and how dare anyone come and
[1:22:57] take it. I'm going to wipe out anyone
[1:22:58] who stands in my way." Or are you just
[1:23:00] going to build a foundation to make it
[1:23:01] easy?
[1:23:03] Like for example, if the rapture was
[1:23:06] going to happen in 100 years time, I'd
[1:23:08] want to make sure that every young
[1:23:10] person in this church knows God. Doesn't
[1:23:12] matter if it's going to happen tomorrow
[1:23:13] in 100 years. Amen. What we do? We're
[1:23:15] going to lay up lay up treasure of the
[1:23:18] word for our next generation. Amen. the
[1:23:20] pitfalls and things we had to go
[1:23:22] through, they don't have to repeat it.
[1:23:24] You know, why should you know people get
[1:23:25] a mentality? Well, I had to struggle,
[1:23:27] they have to struggle. WHY DO THEY HAVE
[1:23:28] TO STRUGGLE?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I had to find my way by myself,
[1:23:31] therefore they have to. Why do they have
[1:23:33] to DO IT? IT'S A DIFFERENT SEASON.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Why do they have to start from
[1:23:37] scratch like we did? We should be able
[1:23:39] to like just just be a stepping stone
[1:23:41] for them to go forward with God.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; That's what our life should be. Amen.
[1:23:45] Because we want to see God's kingdom go
[1:23:47] forward. Why should they have to start
[1:23:48] from scratch?
[1:23:50] Oh, but I had to I had to suffer. That's
[1:23:52] a victim mentality speaking. I had to go
[1:23:55] through hardship. I had to, you know,
[1:23:56] all these things. We didn't have all
[1:23:57] this when we were started off. Yeah.
[1:23:59] God's moved on.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go back into a leaky
[1:24:03] building or a house or, you know, we
[1:24:07] don't have to go back into that because
[1:24:09] we started like that. There's another
[1:24:12] generation here.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And they can take the word
[1:24:15] further.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] What if they see things in the word I
[1:24:20] never see? Am I going to be annoyed? No.
[1:24:22] I'll be happy. I see the love of God
[1:24:24] shed abroad in their hearts, God moving
[1:24:26] in their midst. Praise the Lord. I'm
[1:24:27] going to be happy for that. Shouldn't we
[1:24:29] be happy or should we be? No, I don't.
[1:24:31] No, that's wrong. Cuz this is this and
[1:24:33] this is not fair, God. Why do you do it
[1:24:34] for them? Why Why have you given it to
[1:24:36] them on a silver platter, God? That's
[1:24:38] not fair. Do we say it like that? No. We
[1:24:41] say, "Praise the Lord. Make it gold,
[1:24:43] Lord.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Take it from a silver platter to a gold
[1:24:45] one. Give a golden spoon, Lord. Pour it
[1:24:48] in.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; A not trying to be jokey, but yeah, this
[1:24:53] should be our heart.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; We don't want them to struggle like we
[1:24:56] did. They'll have their battles. Why
[1:24:58] give them yours?
[1:25:02] Yeah, our battles were dumb. They were
[1:25:03] good, but they were dumb. Why? Why? Why
[1:25:06] pass those things on? Amen. So, what h
[1:25:09] but I think what happens is a real
[1:25:11] believer when he gets into the prince of
[1:25:12] God, he can recognize other believers. I
[1:25:15] was thinking of Mount Transfiguration.
[1:25:18] It's interesting in the scripture where,
[1:25:20] you know, nowhere does it say Peter,
[1:25:21] James, and John asked Jesus, "Who are
[1:25:23] the two men standing next to you?" But
[1:25:25] they s and they didn't have any
[1:25:26] photographs. There's no video footage of
[1:25:28] Moses and Elijah. They had no idea what
[1:25:30] they really look like. But when they're
[1:25:31] in the presence of God and they saw
[1:25:33] those two men speaking to the Lord, they
[1:25:35] realized this is Moses and Elijah, they
[1:25:38] recognize their position in the
[1:25:40] scripture. And so anyone who really
[1:25:42] comes into the presence of God, who's a
[1:25:44] gene seed of God, will recognize other
[1:25:47] people's position in the word. Amen.
[1:25:49] Like Jonathan recognized David's
[1:25:51] position that the kingdom is going to
[1:25:53] come through Judah. So it's going to
[1:25:55] come through you, David. Of course, it's
[1:25:56] according to the scripture. The the
[1:25:58] kingdom can't continue with Benjamin
[1:26:00] because the Lord said it's going to come
[1:26:02] through Judah.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So Jonathan did not have a a um
[1:26:09] victim mentality.
[1:26:11] He had an overcomer mentality.
[1:26:14] And when he died there with with his
[1:26:16] father,
[1:26:18] David would say they were they were
[1:26:19] united. They're not divided. He stood in
[1:26:22] his integrity. Amen. He was loyal to
[1:26:24] David, but he was loyal to his father at
[1:26:26] the same time. He didn't betray his
[1:26:28] father. He didn't kill his father to let
[1:26:30] David on the throne. He didn't do
[1:26:31] anything underhanded. He stood there in
[1:26:33] his integrity. Why? Because he was not
[1:26:35] he did had not have a victim mentality.
[1:26:37] He didn't feel entitled at all. He was
[1:26:39] just happy to see God take over and God
[1:26:42] take the kingdom forward using David.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyone like that has a real
[1:26:48] overcomer overcomer anointing upon them.
[1:26:51] They're actually made to be an
[1:26:52] overcomer.
[1:26:54] Amen. Like the Apostle Paul would say,
[1:26:56] "But we have this treasure in earth and
[1:26:57] vessels." I'm just going to kind of wind
[1:26:59] this up real soon. That the excellency
[1:27:01] of the power may be of God and not of
[1:27:03] us. We're troubled on every side yet not
[1:27:05] distressed. We are perplexed but not in
[1:27:07] despair. This is an overcomer. He
[1:27:09] doesn't say there's nothing wrong. Hey,
[1:27:11] we're distressed. You know, we got
[1:27:13] trouble on every side. We're perplexed,
[1:27:15] but we're not in despair. Persecuted,
[1:27:16] but not forsaken. Cast down, but not
[1:27:18] destroyed. See, a real overcomer says,
[1:27:20] "Yes, there's obstacles. Yes, there's
[1:27:22] problems, but I'm not a victim of
[1:27:23] problems. I'm not a victim of the
[1:27:25] devil's schemes. I'm an overcomer."
[1:27:27] Amen. I've been built to overcome
[1:27:29] whatever whatever comes against me.
[1:27:31] Amen. In the spiritual world, I'm here
[1:27:33] to wrestle with this thing and overcome.
[1:27:36] Praise the Lord. always bearing about in
[1:27:38] the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
[1:27:40] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:27:42] made manifest in our body. For we which
[1:27:44] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:27:46] Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus
[1:27:48] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:27:50] flesh. So then death workketh in us, but
[1:27:53] life in you. Amen. That see the Apostle
[1:27:57] Paul didn't have a victim mentality.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He was an overcomer.
[1:28:01] Amen. He says, "Now thanks be unto God
[1:28:04] which always causes us to triumph in
[1:28:06] Christ." always cause a he caused us to
[1:28:09] triumph. I mean, someone who's a victim
[1:28:11] never never speaks positive. You know,
[1:28:13] look at your your thinking, your thought
[1:28:15] patterns of life. I mean, someone who's
[1:28:18] has a victim mentality always thinks
[1:28:20] negative. Someone's who's entitled
[1:28:22] always thinks negative. What about me?
[1:28:23] And it's always upon self. But someone
[1:28:25] who's an overcomer, they realize that
[1:28:28] God within them is far greater, more
[1:28:31] powerful. He, you know, they realize
[1:28:33] that God is more than able and God has
[1:28:35] allowed this to come into our lives to
[1:28:38] pro for him to prove his word.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he always caused us to triumph
[1:28:43] in Christ. You should put that on the
[1:28:44] fridge if you want to put something on
[1:28:45] the fridge. Always cause us to triumph.
[1:28:47] Amen. And make manifest the savior of
[1:28:49] his knowledge of by us in every place.
[1:28:52] Amen. The apostle Paul say, "For who
[1:28:54] shall separate us from the love of
[1:28:55] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:28:58] persecution, Amen. or famine or
[1:29:00] nakedness or peril or sword. See, he
[1:29:02] always looked at things in the positive
[1:29:04] way. I've been through all these things.
[1:29:06] It hasn't separated me from the love of
[1:29:08] God. It can't separate me. I've been
[1:29:10] through the I've been through the fire.
[1:29:12] I've been through the ringer and it's
[1:29:14] just proven to me nothing can separate
[1:29:16] me from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[1:29:18] our Lord. Amen. For it is written, for
[1:29:20] thy sake we are killed all the day long.
[1:29:22] We are accounted as sheep for the
[1:29:24] slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we
[1:29:26] are more than conquerors through him
[1:29:28] that loved us. Not just a conqueror,
[1:29:30] more than a conqueror. Amen. More than a
[1:29:32] conqueror. For I'm persuaded that
[1:29:34] neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:29:36] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:29:37] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:29:39] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[1:29:41] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:29:43] God, which is in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:29:46] Amen. So when he says angels there, he's
[1:29:47] not just speaking about angels in their
[1:29:49] position. He's speaking about fallen
[1:29:50] angels. He's talking about Satan and all
[1:29:53] of his demons. Amen. So he says that
[1:29:55] there is nothing in existence that can
[1:29:58] separate me.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so what shall we do then? If
[1:30:05] this is how we should be, what's our
[1:30:07] mentality towards this world? I'm kind
[1:30:09] of going to going to segue back to this
[1:30:11] now.
[1:30:12] Now, when the you look at the you look
[1:30:14] at the Jewish people, you look at the
[1:30:16] Jewish people, the most persecuted group
[1:30:19] in existence is them. Everywhere they
[1:30:22] go, they've been they've been killed,
[1:30:24] forced to convert, they've been driven,
[1:30:27] they've lost everything. Are they
[1:30:29] victims? When you think of Israel, do
[1:30:31] you think of a victim mentality?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; You think of someone uh there are people
[1:30:36] that say, "This is who we are. We're not
[1:30:38] ashamed that we're the sons and
[1:30:39] daughters of Abraham." Amen. We this is
[1:30:42] our land and this is how we are. But
[1:30:43] they they are overcomers. They've had
[1:30:45] great obstacles. You just look at their
[1:30:47] history, you know, through the creation
[1:30:49] of the Jewish state, all these things.
[1:30:50] But they do not feel a victim mentality.
[1:30:54] No, not at all. They they have every
[1:30:56] right to say poor us and wo is us and
[1:30:58] everything's wrong and you know, no,
[1:31:00] they do not think that way. That's why
[1:31:03] they're the most successful nation in
[1:31:05] terms of technology and advancements.
[1:31:07] People say they want to boycott Israel.
[1:31:10] Well, basically boycott every part of
[1:31:11] technology that you have cuz part of it
[1:31:14] came out of there,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; right? But so so
[1:31:20] what did Jeremiah tell the people?
[1:31:21] Because this is this is how they begin
[1:31:23] to live. Now this is this is Jeremiah
[1:31:25] writing to the exiles that have already
[1:31:27] been taken into Babylon. He says, "Thus
[1:31:29] say the Lord of hosts, the God of
[1:31:30] Israel, unto all that are carried away
[1:31:33] captives whom I have caused to whom I
[1:31:36] have caused to be carried away from
[1:31:38] Jerusalem unto Babylon." I thought it
[1:31:40] was the Babylonians. No, God caused it.
[1:31:42] Build ye houses and dwell in them. Plant
[1:31:44] gardens and eat the fruit of them. Take
[1:31:46] ye wives and begget sons and daughters,
[1:31:48] and take wives for your sons, and give
[1:31:50] your daughters to husbands, that they
[1:31:52] may bear sons and daughters, that ye may
[1:31:53] be increased there, and not diminished.
[1:31:56] And seek the peace of the city, whether
[1:31:59] thou where I have caused you to be
[1:32:01] carried away captives, and pray unto the
[1:32:03] Lord for it, for in the peace thereof
[1:32:05] shall ye have peace." So, he didn't say,
[1:32:09] "Now, this is what you do when you go
[1:32:10] there. Feel sorry for yourselves. you're
[1:32:12] a victim of international
[1:32:15] wars and strife and politics and this is
[1:32:17] the high priest's fault and this is why
[1:32:20] you're here and have a victim mentality
[1:32:21] and you know and and then go protest and
[1:32:24] cause a bunch of trouble and feel sorry
[1:32:26] and entitled cuz you're God's people. He
[1:32:27] doesn't say that, does he? Did you read
[1:32:29] that in there? No. He said he said no.
[1:32:32] Live life, build houses, grow the
[1:32:36] community. Amen. And pray for the peace
[1:32:39] of the city where you dwell. And I was
[1:32:41] thinking about this. I thought, when was
[1:32:42] the last time I prayed for the peace of
[1:32:44] Lower Hut? I'll be honest. I don't know.
[1:32:47] That's a bad thing cuz he's giving them
[1:32:50] instructions. Pray for the peace of that
[1:32:53] city where you dwell.
[1:32:56] Amen. For the peace thereof shall be uh
[1:32:58] shall ye have peace. So, we're not
[1:33:01] victims of circumstance. They weren't
[1:33:03] victims of circumstance. God's telling
[1:33:06] them through Jeremiah, "No, build live.
[1:33:09] Don't just sit back and say, "Wo is me."
[1:33:11] And pray that the peace of God would
[1:33:13] reign where you are. Oh, in a heathen
[1:33:15] nation, absolutely.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Everything that happens in life, let's
[1:33:25] just
[1:33:27] remember this is my musings, okay? So,
[1:33:28] we're just kind of jumping a bit.
[1:33:30] Brother Ram says this, he proves all of
[1:33:32] his words. All of his words. Just think
[1:33:34] of it. All of his words. And you were
[1:33:37] his word. He was the word. and you're
[1:33:39] part of his word. And that's the reason
[1:33:41] you're sent here to confirm your place
[1:33:43] in life. Amen. So what is your place in
[1:33:46] life? An overcomer.
[1:33:48] Victorious.
[1:33:50] Going through many mighty battles, but
[1:33:52] coming out packing the victory. Amen. A
[1:33:55] surrendered, consecrated life to God as
[1:33:58] the bride of Jesus Christ. This is why
[1:34:00] trouble comes. This is why God has
[1:34:03] placed you in the darkest of ages. that
[1:34:06] God is going to prove his word. He's
[1:34:09] going to prove these words. Not your
[1:34:12] mental ability, not how not how strong
[1:34:14] you are, not how quickwitted you may be.
[1:34:16] No, that gene seed of God in your soul.
[1:34:19] He's going to prove that to you like he
[1:34:21] proved it in Abraham, like he proved it
[1:34:23] down all through the ages. He's going to
[1:34:25] prove his word.
[1:34:27] And it will confirm your place in life.
[1:34:30] Not as a victim, but as an overcomer.
[1:34:33] Not as someone who's got an entitled
[1:34:35] mentality, but an overcomer. Amen. Who's
[1:34:38] thankful, who rejoices, who's made peace
[1:34:42] with their lineage, who's made peace
[1:34:44] with their past, who's made peace with
[1:34:46] where they came from, and they say, "No,
[1:34:48] I'm a son of God.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, I can trace my family back, and I
[1:34:53] say, they're a bunch of Skellyywags.
[1:34:57] I could talk about my my my past, the
[1:34:59] Dutch East India Company and all these
[1:35:01] different things. They're a bunch of
[1:35:03] renegades, but through that I'm here.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; I'm here. I can't answer for what they
[1:35:10] did. I can't live under some cloud of
[1:35:11] look at what they did. This is me today.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And being a son of God, I'm not even
[1:35:16] part of that. God used it to bring a
[1:35:19] ting.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Okay? Just like all of us. So, we can't
[1:35:22] be ashamed of where we came from. We
[1:35:24] can't allow culture and upbringing to
[1:35:26] shape us to say, "Well, I'm from this
[1:35:28] place, therefore, I'm less than someone
[1:35:29] else." There's no lesser in the kingdom
[1:35:31] of God.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; We're all equal as the bride of Jesus
[1:35:34] Christ. We're all equally valuable.
[1:35:36] Doesn't matter where we came from, our
[1:35:38] upbringing. Let's get rid of that stuff.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Let's not think, "No, we're no, we're
[1:35:43] less." No, none of us are less.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all these things come upon us
[1:35:52] that God will confirm. He wants to
[1:35:54] confirm your place in life.
[1:35:57] Praise the Lord. So, what's the summary
[1:35:58] of all this thing? Be careful for
[1:36:00] nothing, but everything by prayer and
[1:36:02] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[1:36:04] requests be made known unto God. And the
[1:36:06] peace of God which passes all
[1:36:08] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:36:09] minds through Christ Jesus. Right? So,
[1:36:12] you give with prayer. So, be careful
[1:36:15] means be anxious for nothing. Okay? This
[1:36:17] is how you don't have a victim
[1:36:19] mentality. This is the answer right
[1:36:20] here. Okay? Make all your prayer and you
[1:36:24] know prayer with supplication with
[1:36:26] thanksgiving. Be thankful when you pray
[1:36:28] that your requests be made known unto
[1:36:30] God. And with that then you get the
[1:36:32] peace of God which passes all
[1:36:33] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:36:35] minds through Christ Jesus. So if you
[1:36:36] want your spirit to be kept
[1:36:39] anxious take it to the Lord in prayer
[1:36:42] with thanksgiving. Right? And then
[1:36:44] finally brethren, now this is this is
[1:36:46] the opposite. This is the opposite of a
[1:36:48] victim mentality thought pattern.
[1:36:51] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[1:36:52] true, whatsoever things are honest,
[1:36:54] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[1:36:57] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[1:36:58] lovely, whatsoever things are a good
[1:37:00] report, if there be any virtue, if there
[1:37:02] be any praise, think on these things.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; So, don't think on the negative. Stop
[1:37:08] the negative thinking. Think positive.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, but my life's falling apart. But
[1:37:13] there's a way out.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; It's all happened for a reason,
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; right? David came to Ziglag. They lost
[1:37:20] all their families. The lowest point in
[1:37:22] his life was that point. What did he do?
[1:37:24] He encouraged himself in the Lord his
[1:37:26] God.
[1:37:28] God then spoke to him. What should I do?
[1:37:30] He didn't say, "Well, now I'm a victim
[1:37:31] of just circumstances and I was running
[1:37:33] for my life and God, why don't you deal
[1:37:35] with Saul and why is this so hard?" He
[1:37:37] never had that kind of thinking. He just
[1:37:40] thought, "Lord, what next?"
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He say, "But his life was in ruins. He
[1:37:44] lost everything." Yeah, but God can
[1:37:45] change that.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And what did God say? Pursue. for you
[1:37:49] will recover all without fail.
[1:37:52] Basically, you David, you're going to
[1:37:53] get everything back. Amen. So, what did
[1:37:55] he do? He went to his men with that
[1:37:56] revelation. Brethren, we've lost it all,
[1:37:59] but we're going to get it all back.
[1:38:02] We're not victims. We're not victims of
[1:38:04] some big political move between the
[1:38:06] Philistines and Saul, the Amalachites.
[1:38:07] No, we're not victims. We're overcomers.
[1:38:10] And God is going to prove
[1:38:13] he's going to confirm our place in life.
[1:38:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Well, they do. They pursued and
[1:38:19] recovered all because a victim does not
[1:38:22] pursue. They just want to hide in a cave
[1:38:24] and feel sorry for themselves. An
[1:38:26] overcomer will recognize, "Yeah, the
[1:38:28] devil's taken some things. I'm getting
[1:38:29] them back."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. My joy may be gone, but I'm
[1:38:32] getting it back. And my family may be
[1:38:34] gone, but I'm getting them back. Amen.
[1:38:36] God, show me how to pursue. Show me how
[1:38:38] to pursue and take the enemy's head off
[1:38:40] that I can get them all back. Oh, you
[1:38:42] can't do that. David did under the blood
[1:38:44] of bulls and goats. He did. Amen. And we
[1:38:46] may be not fighting a war with swords
[1:38:48] and spears and bows and arrows, but
[1:38:50] we're fighting a spiritual war. Amen.
[1:38:52] And we fight against spiritual powers.
[1:38:54] And we have the authority of God's word
[1:38:56] in our lives. I mean, we're living in
[1:38:58] prophecy just like David did. David was
[1:39:00] prophesied, you're going to be king. He
[1:39:02] got there.
[1:39:04] Praise the Lord. He got there. Amen. His
[1:39:07] son, he said, "Your son will build the
[1:39:09] temple." He got there.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're living UNDER
[1:39:12] WE'RE LIVING UNDER PROPHECY. a bride
[1:39:14] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:39:17] thing. An overcomer that's worthy to sit
[1:39:19] in the overcomer's throne. Amen. That's
[1:39:22] prophecy. We're living in that prophecy.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You know, brother says the that the
[1:39:26] anointing sent in the age is the only
[1:39:28] way the believer can live.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the martyrs, they
[1:39:33] lived under an ox anointing. They could
[1:39:35] only live by that anointing. That's why
[1:39:37] they live the way they live. They gladly
[1:39:39] gave their lives. What about those under
[1:39:41] an eagle prophetic anointing that can
[1:39:43] look beyond what the five senses tell
[1:39:45] them? Look beyond what their mind even
[1:39:47] tells them is contrary to the word and
[1:39:48] they can look to the end. Just like
[1:39:50] brother Ed was preaching about being
[1:39:52] outside of time. You can look to the end
[1:39:54] by this anointing. And it doesn't mean
[1:39:55] you live as some monk who's useless in
[1:39:57] the world. No, you're useful. I mean,
[1:39:59] God gives you understanding and wisdom
[1:40:01] how to live in this world, not as a
[1:40:03] victim, but as an overcomer.
[1:40:05] There is there is many ways. There's a
[1:40:07] saying, and I'm going to use this and
[1:40:08] and and I I don't mean to sound
[1:40:10] sacrilegious, but there's many ways to
[1:40:12] skin a cat.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Have you heard that saying?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; There's not just one way. If the first
[1:40:18] method doesn't work, try another method.
[1:40:20] There's many ways to do it. You have an
[1:40:23] objective in your heart for the word to
[1:40:25] be fulfilled. You have a longing for a
[1:40:27] prayer to be answered. Say, "God, show
[1:40:29] me how to do it."
[1:40:31] It may be a totally different approach
[1:40:32] than you think of, but God will give you
[1:40:34] the wisdom. See, David didn't always
[1:40:36] just charge into battle. He always
[1:40:38] consulted the Lord. Lord, what should I
[1:40:39] do? And God says, rise up, attack them.
[1:40:42] Next time, go back around this side,
[1:40:44] hide under the mberry trees. But when
[1:40:46] you hear the sound of a going, rise up
[1:40:48] and kill your enemy. See, God showed him
[1:40:50] what to do in every battle. It was
[1:40:52] different.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; What about the battles you face?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; God will give you the key to unlock that
[1:40:58] thing.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we know it's a key of faith,
[1:41:01] but God will show you how to use it.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, but no, everything's falling apart.
[1:41:05] I'm just a victim. We're not victims.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; We are overcomers.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, this message came to identify
[1:41:11] overcomers, and it has. You are
[1:41:13] overcomers. Are you still a believer?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You're still walking with the Lord. His
[1:41:19] grace is still upon your life. Amen.
[1:41:21] He's kept you all these years. You may
[1:41:22] have gone astray, but he pulled you
[1:41:24] back. Amen. He's been with you. His
[1:41:26] blood atones for you. What is that?
[1:41:28] You're an overcomer.
[1:41:30] You you have overcome another week.
[1:41:32] That's why you're here again.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every day, the faith
[1:41:36] that the martyrs use to overcome the
[1:41:39] lions and the torture and the coliseum
[1:41:41] and all those things, the same faith,
[1:41:43] Brother Ram says you use every day to
[1:41:45] overcome.
[1:41:47] Just a different enemy,
[1:41:49] right? So, let's not be victims.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; I don't Yeah, it's easy to preach you
[1:41:55] because I'm preaching to the choir,
[1:41:56] right? The world may have a victim
[1:41:58] entitled mentality. You don't have to
[1:42:00] have it.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. We're not here to
[1:42:03] feel sorry for ourselves. We're to say,
[1:42:05] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:42:07] strengthens me. I mean, I'm not a
[1:42:08] victim. I'm an overcomer. I'm sorry.
[1:42:10] Let's just have the musicians, please.
[1:42:12] Otherwise, I'm just going to keep going.
[1:42:13] But you see, never ever think, Paul, wo
[1:42:15] is me.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Your world falls apart. It's like,
[1:42:18] praise the Lord, God. What do you want
[1:42:20] to show me? Hallelujah. God, you want to
[1:42:24] prove your word in my life? Oh, well
[1:42:26] that was very unexpected. Praise the
[1:42:28] Lord. What do you want to show me Lord?
[1:42:31] You want to prove yourself in this
[1:42:32] situation.
[1:42:35] Amen.
[1:42:38] So summary, victim mentality is not for
[1:42:40] a child of God. Overcomer mentality is
[1:42:43] what we need.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:6, for to be connly
[1:42:48] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[1:42:50] minded is life and peace. Amen. A victim
[1:42:53] mentality is a carnal mind. It doesn't
[1:42:55] bring life, doesn't bring victory. But a
[1:42:58] spiritually minded is to be his is life
[1:43:00] and peace. And that's an overcomers
[1:43:01] mentality. Hey, the devil will tell you
[1:43:03] all kinds of things how useless,
[1:43:05] hopeless, and lost cause things may be.
[1:43:08] Don't listen to him. He doesn't know the
[1:43:10] end. He's trying to sell you a lie. Why
[1:43:13] not take God's truth and say, "Satan,
[1:43:15] that's what you think, but I don't care
[1:43:17] what you think anymore. I'm taking what
[1:43:18] God's word says about the situation."
[1:43:20] Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's um let's stand
[1:43:24] shy. Let's sing that song. I'm fighting
[1:43:26] a battle. You've already won. Whatever
[1:43:29] comes my way, I have overcome.
[1:43:32] I know I'm bad. Yeah, I'm naughty. I
[1:43:34] change songs. I think, you know, I sing
[1:43:36] I know what you're doing cuz I know what
[1:43:37] you've done. Praise the Lord. Well, how
[1:43:40] do you know what he's doing? Well, I
[1:43:42] know what he's done. He's called me to
[1:43:44] be a son of God. So, what is he doing?
[1:43:46] He's molding my character in this trial.
[1:43:51] Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; There's peace that outlaws darkness.
[1:44:00] [singing]
[1:44:02] Hope that's in the blood.
[1:44:06] There's [music and singing] future grace
[1:44:08] that's mine today. That Jesus Christ is
[1:44:14] one

[1:49:56] [music]
[1:49:57] You're already one.
[1:50:03] [music]
[1:50:09] [music]
[1:50:15] Why would I [singing] worry? [music]
[1:50:17] Giants come calling my name.
[1:50:24] My God is so much bigger. [music]
[1:50:28] Troubles I face.
[1:50:34] Why would [music] I hunger power or
[1:50:37] riches of faith?
[1:50:41] [music]
[1:50:43] My God is [singing] so much bigger than
[1:50:46] all [music] of these things.
[1:50:51] I won't be shen. [music]
[1:50:56] I won't be moved.
[1:51:00] My [music] God is faithful.
[1:51:04] His promise is true. [music]
[1:51:09] So I speak to the mountain.
[1:51:12] [music and singing]
[1:51:14] It's time.
[1:51:19] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:51:24] greater [music] than.

[1:51:42] [music]
[1:51:48] died for my ransom. He rose up [music]
[1:51:51] on the third day.
[1:51:54] My God is greater. [music] My God is
[1:52:03] I won't be sh [music]

[1:55:35] Amen. Gracious heavenly father, as we
[1:55:38] bow our heads, we say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:40] We don't need to be a victim."
[1:55:42] Hallelujah. We don't need to have an
[1:55:44] entitled spirit about us, but Lord, we
[1:55:47] want to be clothed in the humility of
[1:55:48] the Holy Ghost. Lord, as an overcomer,
[1:55:51] Lord, I believe you've made every one of
[1:55:53] us to be overcomers. Dear God, that we
[1:55:56] would not be not feel sorry for
[1:55:58] ourselves permanently. We would have
[1:56:00] some pity party spirit or anything of
[1:56:02] that way. But dear God, we would just
[1:56:04] look at every situation we're facing and
[1:56:07] say, "My God is more than able." Lord,
[1:56:09] you're more than enough. Lord, you
[1:56:11] purchased every every redemptive
[1:56:13] blessing, Lord, that you wrote in your
[1:56:15] word. You purchased for us that day on
[1:56:16] Calvary. And Father, I pray we just
[1:56:19] press forward, press the battle,
[1:56:21] knowing, dear God, that you always cause
[1:56:23] us to triumph, that we're more than
[1:56:25] conquerors in Christ Jesus. Thank you,
[1:56:27] dear God. I pray you touch each one
[1:56:29] here. And Father, if that if that
[1:56:32] thought pattern ever comes near us,
[1:56:34] tries to get us to agree with it, Lord,
[1:56:36] that we're victims and everything's
[1:56:39] that way, may we resist it in the name
[1:56:42] of Jesus Christ. May it be a shock to
[1:56:44] us, those thoughts even to enter our
[1:56:45] mind. May we turn it down in Jesus
[1:56:48] Christ's name because you didn't make us
[1:56:49] that way. You made us to be overcomers.
[1:56:51] So may you bless each one here. Bless
[1:56:53] those who are streaming. Father, be with
[1:56:55] us, Lord, for the Sunday school picnic
[1:56:56] now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:56:59] Amen.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
