the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church wherefore I um am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to to whom God would have made uh would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer and if anyone want to be remember pray want to raise your hand to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father we so thankful that all is well Lord that we have found that place of perfect rest within the inner Veil Lord that you rent that Veil for us to come and dwell in

Soul father doesn't matter how old or young we may be Lord I pray you'll speak to every heart father may you be our portion today Lord I ask that Lord as we uh Lord may you continue to change us from Glory unto Glory Jesus father I just ask that you'd have preeminence in the service Lord meet every need that's here father I ask Lord that you'll give us strength Lord and and Lord I pray you'll heal those who are not well father be with those who are not here father be their portion as well we just want to commit them into your hands as well and we ask Lord that you'd have Lord you'd receive all honor glory and praise Lord this day in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning um I'd like to just take a little thought about Christ in you the hope of glory now notice the Apostle Paul when he is writing this out he does not say that it is religion in you the hope of glory or a group of collection of man's ideas or theories of morality or correct Doctrine or a knowledge of historical events but Christ in you the anointing in you right and we know that Christ means the anointed or the anointing that's right amen so Christ in you is the life of God the Living Word manifested in you amen it is Christ as Christ has been revealed down Through the Ages is that same one revealed in you amen so now when you know you know we're living in a day where where where the bride has come to its manifestation you know as as there were two there was a man and a woman in the Garden of Eden and they were one flesh and and they were part of each other so down through the Old Testament after the fall God rebuilt the man and that man is Jesus Christ but then there also has to be the the the Redemption of the woman so there has to be a second Eve so now as as and from Calvary down to now the the second Eve has been manifesting down through the church ages and now we have come to a time where we're not just manifesting Christ in part but Christ in fullness so it's not just part of the word living it's now the fullness of the word is manifested in the people hallelujah so you know so so if we talk about Christ in you the hope of glory it is the word made manifest in you amen it's more than just being anointed because you know as I said the word Christ means the anointing or the anointed so people can be anointed but we have to be more than just be Anointed with the Holy Ghost now we're going to I'm going to show you this quickly but you know Jesus when he came you know he went to the river a Jordan and he was baptized and it says in Luke 3 and 21 and 22 and verse 22 it says and the Holy Ghost ascended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice from Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son in thee I'm well pleased and then in Luke 41 it says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness and and the Apostle Paul would would would write in the book of Colossians not in the piece we've just read but he said but in the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ so all that God was he poured into Christ he he wasn't he wasn't manifesting God in in in a partial way like you see Christ was in Moses in part Christ was in Joseph in part he was in David in part he was in Jeremiah in part all the Believers down through the Old Testament they were manifesting part of God but God became flesh the fullness of the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us that's why the fullness of God was in Christ but then brother Braham says all that God was he poured himself into Christ and all that was in Christ is poured into the church is poured into you Hallelujah so now we are not just a you know we're not here haphazardly we're not Believers haphazardly but we are part of him we're part of his word and we're called to manifest a part of the scripture all lighted to us hallelujah so as I said now we can be anointed but there are as it says in Matthew 24 and 24 Jesus is speaking of these last days that there shall arise many false christs and false prophets and they shall show forth great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect amen so so he's saying so so notice he's not saying false jesuses even yet there are people in the world that say they are Jesus but that wouldn't full a real believer amen it wouldn't bring into question of you know if I stood here and said I am Jesus Christ you'd say this place is crazy and you walk out the door iust you would right but then if someone comes along and says they're anointed they're the man of the hour with power you know you know then you got to be wary with that because it says that there are many false Christ or false anointed ones so the anointing is genuine but the vessel's not true that's right right so they are falsely they are false vessels with a true anointing and this is this is where the dangerous part comes in and a classic example of this is balum you got to look at everyone's motive and objective balum when know was was hired by Moab to try and curse Israel as as Israel was journeying from Egypt to the promised land and the king of Moab knew that he could not defeat Israel with his armies so he had to come a different way so he went and hide balum and asked him can you curse these people that that you know that we can have Victory so balum was a genuine prophet he knew he had the right approach to God he he offered the same sacrifices that Israel sacrificed seven Bullocks and seven Rams different things he had the right approach to God but his but his motive in worshiping God wasn't pure his motive was to get money amen and that's why when I was writing this down I asked you know I kind of asked myself the question I asked you the same question when we come to worship God why are we worshiping him amen because many people have a lot of different motives but you know you got to have the right motive our motive should be Lord I worship you cuz you've be you've called me you've you've redeemed me you've washed me in your blood your your your I am here to be made in your image I mean I've been here to be made in the image of your word and that's why I worship you because of what you've done for me not what I can get out of him Hallelujah but balum balum had a genuine gift it says in if you read from Numbers 22 to 25 is the account of balum and it says the spirit of the Lord it said the spirit of God Came Upon him and he prophesied and his prophecies are still reading true today so the so the gift in him was was right but the vessel was wrong because the vessel was looking for material gain instead of actually standing for the promised word of the day because if he was a real genuine Prophet as in a true vessel he would have joined him with Moses saying you know God has called you and and the promise of the day is that Israel will go into the promised land what can I do to help God's program not work against God's program but work for his program and that's why it's so V you know so vital that we know God's program for our day which I'm not going to go into but you know we don't want to be working against what God is doing brother B said people are praying and fasting for Revival but but yet working right against it we don't want to fall into that category amen so he was worshiping God to get uh material gain to get money so that's the same question now what is our motivation are we a believer that we'd get influence over people have a little kingdom you can have one person following you you've got a kingdom it's very small but you can have an influence human influence over someone and what you've got a kingdom is that why we're Believers that we can influence different people control them under our Humanity amen is it that we can have some kind of social standing among people or is it because what he's done for us is it because we're part of his word that's why we worship Him Hallelujah so we want to be we want to look at our motive and objective amen now if we go to the um if we go to the book of Hebrews chapter 10 we're just going to read a bit more Hallelujah is everyone feeling good amen Hebrews 10 and 4 it says for it is not possible that the blood of balls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me and burn offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hest no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst thou pleasure therein which are offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all then he said then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God Amen now we know this is speaking of the Lord Jesus saying he has come I come in the volume of the book written to me to do thy will so it was already recorded what he would do amen when when our lord Jesus when God became flesh and his Earthly Ministry happened it was already prophesied what he would do and he fulfilled many Prophecies of the Old Testament many types many you know you can look into the you know the even the order of the Tabernacle and the different sacrifices they appointing to Christ amen so now but our Lord he knew what was written it was written already what he would do so when he was walking upon the Earth because remember he was a man he was the god man right he was fully God but he also fully man cuz he had to be a man in order to be our kinsman redeemer to redeem us back to God but he had to be God because only God could do the job right so so as a man now he had to he walked according to the prophecy that he had to fulfill he told his disciples many time for this cause I've come into the world I'm going to be given over to sinful men they'll you know they will kill me by third day I rise again he know he told these things to the to his disciples cuz he knew why he was there because the word wasn't sealed to him I mean the book the book wasn't the book wasn't sealed to him it was very clear when he went into the synagogue of Nazareth among his own people and he and he opened to the book of Isaiah he wasn't just looking for something cool to say or something to tickle their ears he found in the place where was written the spirit of laws upon me and he began to read the prophecy that was in the Old Testament and says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears am mean he wasn't making making any guesses he was declaring that he was the physical manifestation of that prophecy am mean that the people would know I am here to fulfill this word hallelujah so he wasn't guessing he knew who he was and brother Braham said that Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was amen and that's what this message has come to do is that you would know who you are amen amen that you are not just some random person stumbling around this world Amen but Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me and all that will come to you are in no wise cast out that's why this message is a supernatural call am mean to gather God's seed to himself Hallelujah we think sometimes we stumble into it you know I was listening to brother Braham here saying that you know sometimes Heaven just kind of bumps into us you know we just bump into this realm that we don't really know anything about A Hallelujah because you know we can't see the supernatural many of us some can see visions and things but you know many of us we feel the presence of God but we don't see the pillar of fire come down necessarily that doesn't mean he's not here amen right amen amen it's like brother B said about a blind man blind man never seen the son before born blind but he goes out he feels a sun rise upon his skin but someone he can say what is that doing that to me and someone who can see and say that is the Sun in the sky that is why you feel that that way it's the same thing we've had a Prophet come in this generation to declare that he is here I mean the Holy Ghost has been poured out amen he said he you know the pillar of fire was there in the meetings God was present we didn't many people never saw him but but he had eyes to say that's the Sun and then people say oh now I know what that feeling is upon me it's God hallelujah it's the same thing with us amen the spirit of God comes down you may be in your car may be anywhere God will come and meet you Hallelujah and you say the sun is shining cuz I feel it's affecting my life Hallelujah I'm glad we don't we don't follow a historical being I mean someone who's somewhere far away died in 1965 or God left the scene there no the son of man is present upon the Earth Jesus Christ is here hallelujah so now it says when it says the book written of me that word written means a uh that that is that is uh that is uh especially to write figurative figuratively to describe so it's a book that is written to describe me Hallelujah that's what he's talking about written of me it it was describing him what he would do and as I said the Lord knew exactly the parts that described him that's why he could walk with a to on the way way to a m for 6 hours he said now this is where it's written of me to do this and this and this and this and I'm like this and he went through all the types and shadows all the prophecy cuz he knew what he us to fulfill now this has to become the same with us amen that the Bible you know brother Braham said when the seals came open when the Seven Seals came open the Bible became a new book he never said that it was a different translation right but the truth in its fullness became manifested because brother man said the the seals are Christ amen they are Christ so Christ became unveiled he became unsealed that now we don't see him in obscurity anymore but we see him as he is hallelujah just like when you look into the scripture and you can spend a lifetime look people debate how to get baptized how much water lack of water sand all kinds of things age you know people go all kinds of things but then brother you know the prophet came it says baptize in the name of the father son Holy Ghost what's the name father's not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is what he is but what's the name and and for nearly 2,000 years people have just skipped over the word name why cuz it's obscured but now it's become clear well what is the name Jesus said I come in my father's name you receive me not what's the name of the father Jesus all the family in Heaven and Earth is name Jesus Christ amen amen Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost and gives the name repent and be baptized every one of you for remission of sin and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ am H and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's quite simple they don't contradict one interprets the other amen hallelujah amen so now so so the Bible became plain and so now with us we should be able to look into the scripture and say I come in the volume of the book it's written of me hallelujah amen we should be look into the scripture say this book describes me amen that's why we can go to Ruth and I trust you see yourself in Ruth Hallelujah you see yourself when Joseph is revealing himself to his Brethren his Gentile bride already in the palace amen speaking of the Gentile bride is taken up in the Rapture when he comes and reveals himself to the Jews amen Moses took a gentile bride I'm sure you can see yourself in there Hallelujah where Christ is manifesting himself down through the scripture you should be able to see you amen but the thing is you have to go beyond the veil of tradition I mean you have to go beyond the veil of just well this is the message this is church this is how it is and really meet him you for yourself I mean cuz when you really step into his presence become one with him am mean it it it doesn't become common the word doesn't become common am mean when the pot of Mana was put in the holy of holies it never went off it was fresh every generation every time a high priest went into partake of that Mana it was still fresh the word was still fresh in the shikina Glory Hallelujah it's the same thing when this word is placed in your soul and God abides amen not it's not common it doesn't become just some casual thing that that you become indifferent to and you begin to look around now it becomes richer and greater and deeper Hallelujah I trust that's your experience yes sir amen hallelujah you know we were reading a couple of days ago about zakus just at home and zakus wanted to see Jesus for who he was it says in the scripture Hallelujah that's a good way to be amen but he climbed up the sycamore tree and he wanted to try and look down on him you can't look down on the word to see him for who he is remember he was the shortest man in the city so Jesus said come down you're looking at me the wrong way cuz if you look down you're looking at a critical angle you can't look at Jesus you can't look at the message in a critical way and see the son of man amen you got to come down off that tree and look up at him Hallelujah and then when you re look up because when he came down and look up at him he said Lord you know if I've done anything anyone any wrong I'll restore it for fold I'll give half my goods to the poor and now then Jesus because he was looking at him right then Jesus says now salvation has come to your house hallelujah thank he wasn't just a Man from Nazareth to zakus anymore amen I trust that this word is not just a oh it's a Bible and a message and no it's God revealing himself Jesus Christ amen so so our lives I trust when you look into the scripture amen I trust that that that your life no long longer is obscure but it becomes plain yes Hallelujah I me when the angel came to brother brah and commissioned him to take the two gifts of healing to the world the gift of healing and discernment to the world to start the post World War II healing Revival which he did history documents it he said he said the purpose I've come is to explain your peculiar birth and your misunderstood life so the angel came to him to give him Clarity in the scripture what his purpose on the Earth was so he wasn't know cuz other ministers said St you know these visions of there of the devil and all these things and he was all influenced by man's opinion he wasn't sure who he really was but then the Lord had to come himself I mean to show him in the scripture who he was so after that he wasn't tossed to and fro anymore but he knew who he was because God himself came and showed his position in the word amen and it has to be the same thing with you that God comes and anoints this book to your life Hallelujah that that the cross is no longer a story or a tradition it becomes a reality amen that you know in your soul he took your sins up Calvary that day and you bear them no more because they're nailed to his cross Hallelujah what's happening he's giving you Clarity in the scripture of who you are amen that as I quoted the scripture Jesus said all that the father has given me will come and when it becomes a reality you know you're one of them Hallelujah that's why you've come that's why he's revealed himself to you am mean because he's giving you because you begin to realize you know my dad's from Cape Town my mom's a kiwi I'm I was born and raised here but ultimately this is not me this is just where I was born that's just my natural lineage that's right amen nothing against those things but that doesn't give me stability in this life cuz culture can change opinion can change man can change and then if I don't know who I am in in the Lord then I'll just I'll toss to and fro with those things right but if I know who I am if God has revealed himself to me in his word it doesn't matter what comes or what goes I can stand sure saying I know in whom I have believed Hallelujah and then so it has to be the same thing with us the Lord has to come himself and reveal himself to you in the word that you know who you are hallelujah oh God granted amen now so it says in Genesis 1 and one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period in verse two and the Earth was without forn void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters now that same one says in John 1 And1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father father full of grace and truth so the same one that created all things became flesh Amen in Jesus Christ now this may be Elementary but it's very vital because he didn't just become flesh in him he has to become flesh in you amen right the same God that became flesh in Jesus Christ has to become flesh in you that's right because if we're Christians we're Christlike amen and the only way to really be Christlike is that he comes into you and lives his life out of you otherwise we're just being a mimic otherwise we're just being a carnal impersonation but if he comes in if his word his Living Word comes and dwells in you amen it's no longer you living as Paul says but Christ that liveth in me Hallelujah his word his word's got to put on flesh amen that's what it's got to do you see the Apostle Paul when when Jesus said that he was a light to the Gentiles so so Jesus so the scripture said that Jesus is a light to the Gentiles but then God comes to the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus Christ comes to him reveal you reveals himself to the Apostle Paul and then a few years later the Apostle Paul says I'm the light to the Gentiles why is that because it was the same Ministry in Jesus Christ is now in the Apostle Paul amen and then now the life that the Apostle Paul then lived wasn't his own life anymore what he once was he no longer was he was no longer the Pharisee am mean he he was no longer leaning on man's organization to further his status in the church you following me because he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he used his own ability to become something within his organization and he was leaning upon his organization to further what he wanted to do he went to the high priest before he went to Damascus he got letters he got Authority from the high priest to find any Christians in Damascus to put them in Chains and bring them back he was leaning on man's influence to further his own cause but then when he met God himself amen he wasn't worried about Jerusalem he wasn't worried about the high priest and being a Pharisee he had his commission from God himself amen and so as God led him he walked Hallelujah and then he came to the end of his well near the end of his ministry he says you know he says I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision am me so what God called him to do he was faithful to that call amen and because he had a Christ centered life he didn't have a Pharisee centered life no more or the opinion of the Church centered life he had a Christ centered life amen and therefore he could stand against any opposition and he was Victorious remember Christ in you the hope of glory it's more than just nice phrase it's got to be a reality thank you Lord hallelujah now brother B says in the deity of Jesus Christ he says the deity of him who who is he some of them thinks he's a little baby back there he's the one that stood on the invisible platform uh raped out his hands and spoke and said let there be light and there was light that was Jesus Christ he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was he was the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there you talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which are not he spoke and it was so and that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time we found out who you are am mean the devil's trying to hide you back tell you you're just some little trod down something amen you're you're not you're Sons and Daughters of God deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah you I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you it's all right my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made by what was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down the plagues in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity and brother sister that deities in you a little while the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in a Manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life Hallelujah the Creator God himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see him as he isall hallelujah amen so we're living in an hour you know brother brah you know y y we listen to the sermon uh well most of it the Mighty God unvailable for us on Wednesday and and he begins to speak in that uh you know in the beginning and he says usually God has something to do has to do something so unusual to get the people back to the Bible again I can imagine that Noah was a kind of a nut to that scientific age he lived in because they could prove there was no water in the skies but God said there'd be some there so Noah preaching and believing that he became a nut and I'd imagine when Moses went down in Egypt he was a kind of a nut to Pharaoh but remember Pharaoh was a nut to him too amen we realize that even Jesus was considered a heretic that's right Martin Luther was a nut to the Catholic Church John Wesley was a nut to the Anglican so you know it's about time for another nut don't you think so but before there could be a nut there's got to be a bolt first to thread to it so you know Noah being a nut it takes the nut it pulls the bolt pulls something together and hold something together so Noah was able to pull all out that would believe into the ark out of the judgments by being a nut and we find out Moses pulled the church out of Egypt by being a nut that's right I think we need a nut now to pull the bride out of the church amen we need something now another one so we are a very odd sort of people and I thought tonight if the Lord willing I would try to read some scriptures pertaining to this and I want to speak to you just a few moments to try and show you why we're such an odd people so he's saying so he's speaking of now we need a nut we need a Ministry to come to pull the bride out of the church right and then he's going to say I'm going to read some scriptures pertaining to this amen he's not just remember when when the prophet speaks like Jesus when he when you know when he was speaking The Parables he spoke them in a certain order there's a reason he spoke what he spoke where he spoke okay he's not just saying things at random it's the same thing with the ministry of brother brandham when he's preaching a message it's not just something to excite people but he's declaring something amen and so he's saying now I'm going to show you the the scriptures that pertain to the nut that's going to pull the church out the bride out of the church rather amen and now notice let's just go to let's just go to them shall we let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter um Second Corinthians 3 I just want to read these because you know it's so amazing you think of you think of the woman at the well oh Hallelujah and she's she's living her life she's had five husbands the ones with she's not married to and she thinks this is me I'm a Samaritan we have no dealings with the Jews I know about Jacob's Well I'm here at Jacob's well and you know our fathers your fathers say we should Worship in Jerusalem and whatever you know she has all these kind of ideas but that's not why she's there that's not her purpose amen but now the Lord Jesus amen he she was the first building stones in the bride of Christ amen she was the beginning of the restoration of the Of You' say or or the building of the second Eve you following me and she's living this life and this is how I am and I guess I've just got to you know endure this you know and being an outcast in my Village and no no no that wasn't her purpose in life amen but her purpose is that she would become one she was part of the Lord the bride is part of the bridegroom as Eve was part of Adam amen Eve Eve didn't come out of the earth you know separately to Adam Eve was the only female that came out of the male in the creation where God was showing that the the bride of Christ came out of him hallelujah amen that's why the Apostle Paul would pick up where where Levi paid ties and Abraham am mean so what Abraham did was attributed to Levi am mean so when the Lord died on Calvary to redeem you because you were in him it's attributed to you amen hallelujah that's why the sacrifice becomes effective the blood becomes effective amen cuz you were in him when he went to Calvary Hallelujah that's whyu amen I trust the word I trust this is not a this is a reality to you he washed all my sins away he's redeemed me Hallelujah I'm a child of the king amen he's washed me white as snow the devil has no account against me no more my book of life has been washed clean my life is in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah it's not my works anymore it's his Works in me hallelujah amen but because Levi was in Abraham and the Apostle Paul says not figuratively but Levi was literally in the loins of Abraham when he pay tized the mesc and it was attributed to it was attributed to Levi Hallelujah glory to God Amen so you know we have to come to a realization we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and it's not your Humanity we wrestle with the guy in the mirror too much we needed just to come to realization Lord you've made me a certain way with our Perfections and Imperfections you read through the scripture take the lineage of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1 there's Tamer that's not a that's not a that's that's like a scandal amen you know Tamer dressed up as a harlot sleeps with the father-in-law to to bring to bring forth Judah that's part of the lineage Rahab married Salon the lineage continues down it's not a it's not a perfect picture that we would think of but God ordained him that he would even though we know that physically he had nothing to do with you know the natural line coming forth his body was created in the womb of Mary but God said I'm going to attribute my seed coming through these people you following me so so what he's saying is I'll take the broken Hallelujah I'll take the wounded I'll take the hurting I'll take the you know the ones in pain those are the ones I used to bring forth my Glory Hallelujah not the perfect ones not the ones who have it all together not the ones who have got it worked out those aren't the ones I use I use the broken I use the the the hurting the pain the the the you know the bad history whatever it may be God uses them amen David's record wasn't all that good you think he takes bash Sheba Hallelujah he takes asba kills Uriah tries to cover it up and yet through that woman Solomon would come think about it hallelujah hallelujah he had a lot of sons amen he had probably maybe better Sons naturally that would have had better you know you know no black name to begin with no scandal in their family history like that but he to but he used basba to bring forth Solomon wow Hallelujah we'll get into that soon Glory oh I'm just going to read no actually yeah yeah we we're going to go there but but I want to go here first so we're going to jump this is why I don't really use PowerPoint I mean um what do you call it uh yes um iPad I have it here sorry because I'm on this line so I want to go Hallelujah you know I'm glad at least I get to print stuff out anyway here we go let's go to Second Corinthians 5 before we go to 3 now there's a reason God does this because he wants us to look Beyond the Veil of humanity right he doesn't want us to be caught up in our carnal nature and that's not just ourselves but each other amen amen but God uses the broken that's why we but we wrestle with ourselves so much but God through the scripture remember Ruth was a type of Youth Ruth was a moabitas enemy of Israel had no part of the Covenant of God she was a widow but yet God attributed his son coming through Ruth Rahab was a harlot Tamar did her things Hallelujah there's all Scandal and and and terrible history but that is the shadow right now I'm not condoning sin you all understand me am right but sometimes we look at our past and we wrestle because we disappoint ourselves and the more we walk with God the worse we see our past was amen because you're lifted higher above those things so so we we wrestle with our past but if they're the Shadow and they came out of such chaos and God was not ashamed to put them in the in the lineage of Jesus Christ there were many women who who who would have been more suited to marry Salon to you know you know to to continue the line of Judah more woman but why did he choose Rahab Hallelujah because God is showing this is the person I use there are a lot of women in Israel who would have would have wanted to marry Boaz that would have been more suited why did he take why did he take a gentile because God is showing the shadow of you right if that's the shadow this is what we have to come to terms with the shadow is showing a real ity so for example I can't really do it but if I had a shadow of my hand right and as I bring the as I bring you know my hand closer that you actually begin to see my hand you're not going to see a flipper of a dolphin if you look at a shadow of a hand it will be a hand because the hand because what's making the shadow is not going to be something different it's going to be the same thing right so what you see is the shadow in the Old Testament will become the reality in the new amen amen that's why you know if he used those kind of people there he uses them in the new cuz the shadow is pointing the new hallelujah amen now where are we second Corinthians 5 and and and 15 and that he died for all that they which uh live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore because of this henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth we know him no more because we know we know the Lord by his manifested word that's how we know him when his word becomes manifested that's Jesus Christ amen right but he's saying but but we henceforth know we know man after the flesh so we should not know each other after our personality after our culture after anything that is pertaining to this amen we are not I now I pray it's this way I trust we are not in this church because we get along because our personalities just gel and everyone just gets along so well you know that's not I trust that's not why you're here because that's knowing people after the flesh that's actually just being kindly minded amen but we're called to henceforth know no man after the flesh am mean so when we see each other I should say I see I see the word I see the word and just pretend I point it to you all just so no one gets offended I me but but I see the word made flesh I see Jesus Christ in flesh again that's why we have Fellowship that's why we have Oneness around him because we're part of him doesn't matter what age you can be young you can be old you can be in the middle somewhere with with a few more years experience being 18 but you know as long as you can look beyond the human Veil and say I see the word I see de has been made flesh in this person I see that they are part of the Bride Hallelujah that's why the Apostle Paul in First Corinthians 11 says that you know around the Lord's table that's why many are sickly and weak and many sleep not Discerning the Lord's body that's right cuz they're not Discerning actually that is the word made flesh that person is the word made flesh this person's the word right they get caught up in this thing this thing will always disappoint that's right brother right because we have a sticky nature amen and we meant iron needs to sharpen iron Hallelujah and the thing is God is tailor made do you believe your walk is pre-ordained amen so God God sees your nature now in eternity he has a picture of you at your best in his family album right and he's determined you become that image he's determined right at your best not at the peak of your natural best but at his best so now he says I've ordained this person they will look like this my word when they get to the other side so now when he's plann this all he's singing now I know I've got to get them there and I've got to use their free will that they will actually give their will over to me that I can mold them shape them into that image and then so what happens he says well and I know in 2019 whoever place your name here will be in this place amen but he also knows now now I need iron to sharpen iron so now need this person to be here too cuz they are cuz they need to rub they need to Wi scrape and rub and because they have to look like this Hallelujah than God you're God I won't say he's an opportunist but he uses every opportunity hallelujah amen that's why we should henceforth know no man after the flesh glory to God Amen Hallelujah I want to look like him don't you amen you know especially with children you have children and I don't know who said it but it's so true uh they are God's Little agents in your life amen they are they are God's agents and they work full-time sometimes they never sleep they work overtime and you wish they'd take leave but hey you know but God knows what you have need of that's right amen and that's why we shouldn't get frustrated in life because if we're frustrated we're not looking at what as what God's doing cuz if we really can see what God is doing doing then the frustration should go cuzz you see God's purpose in every trial that's why whenever a trial hits could be big or little say Lord what do you wanting to teach me amen you cuz he's got something he doesn't just oh I'm just going to mess up their life and do the you know I'm going to cause some trouble just for them to pull their hair out and no there's a purpose if we can see the purpose then we can with faith faith worketh patience right so if we really believe him then we'll have patience in the trial Lord hallelujah all is well Hallelujah I've heard the message Shalom all is well amen so you know our Lord is a very good teacher Hallelujah and I want to be taught and you know a disciple is one who is actually a pupil right but a true disciple is is is taught by actually doing it's practical it's not just Theory right the Apostle Paul had a lot of theory but then he met the real teacher he met the Lord on the road to Damascus and then went through all practical things he went through child training he went through hardship and distress and things he would never have probably imagined before he met the Lord and the Lord takes us through things it's like what's a trial practical learning Hallelujah practical learning we're going to practically apply this to your life now and sometimes you know it's easier just to sit at a desk and write notes but our God isn't that way he's a practical teacher Hallelujah so thank you Lord glory amen I'm glad okay now let's go back to Second uh Corinthians 3 I mean I just wanted to drop that in because that's where we were second Corinthians 3 says I saying that brother Braham is saying that I want to um so we need a nut to pull the bride out of the church and I'd like to read some scriptures pertaining to this so he goes to 2 Corinthians 3 and and we'll read we'll just read down from verse 7 am I in the right place yes here we are 2 Corinthians 3:7 pardon me but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses from the glory of his countenance which Glory was uh to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceeding glory for even that which was made glorious have no more glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is uh there is Liberty but we all with open face which means unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord I changed transformed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord and then let's go to um he reads another place in in Philippians 2 and 1 and I just want to read these I'm not going to go in great depth into them but I just want to give a quick um a quick uh thought of this here before we wrap up so it says in Philippians 2 and 1 if there be therefore any cons ation in Christ any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and being became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross now so brother Braham is reading these scriptures and he's saying that these pertain to the bride being pulled out of the church Hallelujah now so he's saying so we read here in in in Philippians 2 that when says that he was made in the form uh being in the um that that who was in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation but took upon himself the form of a servant now that word form in the Greek means a morphe which is the physical appearance of something and brother Brown speaks about it's like an actor in a play can take multiple roles they can they can play the part of the villain go out get changed play the part of someone else go out get changed be a different one and it's the same thing with our lord Jesus down Through the Ages he's taken on different forms amen he was in the pillar of fire same God he came as mesc to to Abraham without father or mother descent to your beginning Days end of life mesc was not a man he was God in a different form amen he was in the burning bush to Moses right he was the pillar of cloud By Night by by night and the cloud by day same God Amen is the captain of the Lord's host to Joshua same God different form I mean he came to Moos um Abraham in Genesis 18 as a man and had a meal same God different form right he appeared like an old man to gide him with a staff same God different form amen the same God all the way down through hallelujah amen Ezekiel saw him as the wheel within the wheel same God different form all the way down through and then he became flesh so he changed his form going from invisible to visible Hallelujah so he did this and then he changed his form again where he went from one man into a multimember body Hallelujah and then he appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus as Pillar of Fire again same God different form Paul said who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute and the Apostle Paul is persecuting men and women filled with that Pillar of Fire amen so God changing his form and this is done to call out a bride Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's why we live in the end time where the mighty Angel has descended Revelations 10 with an open book so God put on for me he hid himself behind a prophet Veil to manifest the promised word for the age just like Moses god came down and Moses spoke the word right those people who received that word took their inheritance amen they weren't in the wilderness anymore they weren't by Jordan they went and took their Mountain like Caleb I mean cuz they received they didn't they weren't they didn't know Moses after the flesh like Corin day and different ones they knew him by the revelation of who Moses was in God I mean he was the prophet of the age to bring the word that they would manifest the pro promise of that age which was dwelling in the promised land Hallelujah are you following me am mean it's the same thing in this age brother brah says that the seventh angels on earth when they Revelations 101 that Mighty Angel descends amen so now God comes to his Prophet manifests his word to the people which is the truth of this scripture I mean that a people would come to their position in Christ in their fullness I mean that everything that the church was before the Ephesian age fell or began I mean we would be restored to that same book of Acts Church am mean that there's a people not just talking about the cross but the power of the Cross is manifested in their lives that the word puts on flesh once again I mean we don't just talk about healing we see healing we don't just talk about deliverance we see deliverance we don't just talk about the Holy Ghost we see him in his power I mean we see him in his mighty acts why cuz the end time message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people hallelujah so God changing his form right is now part of God pulling out a bride a nut Hallelujah that threads the bride onto the bolt the word that they become one amen and then and then we read in 2 Corinthians 3 where he says that when the veil is taken away speaking of the Jews when they read the Old Testament that their hearts AV veiled that that when they read it they cannot see what it says that's why the scribes and Pharisees the herodians they said we're moses' disciples we know who Moses was they couldn't see the one who Moses had would come they couldn't see the one that the prophet said would come and he he the Lord manifested all the scripture that was pertaining to his ministry but they couldn't see it because their hearts were veiled right but when the veil was taken away then the people really saw him who he was amen so now it's the same thing even in this day that it's when the veil is taken away that people's spiritual eyes come open amen that's when we can really see him for who he is not hunting stories not just testimonies amen but you see him in his word all those things sure are good and fine but you've got to see him in this day in his word amen that that that when you read the scripture when you hear the message it's not just information it's not just maybe a nice sermon but is God revealing himself to you in order to transform you into His Image amen as it says if the veil is taken away amen now where the spirit of the Lord is where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and that means with there's liberty it means they're no longer slaves but now we're Sons so we're no longer under the bondage of religion or bondage of sin or bondage of the devil amen but now there's liberty now we've come from slavery and now we are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah that's why it's so powerful I mean the devil doesn't want us to know who we are he doesn't want us to come to our position but it's time just to kick the devil off our Mountain amen If he if he's afflicting you just tell him to get out amen by the blood of Jesus Christ he has to listen to your voice not someone else's voice your voice you've got to stand there and say Satan get out out of my life I'm sick of you we're through am mean your divorc we're done away Hallelujah you have to say it you can't just say oh help me help me no God called you to speak his word Moses was there at the Red Sea and God said to him why you crying why are you crying unto me Pharaoh was coming the Red Sea was there God LED them to that place you go read it they didn't just run and where are we going to go let's go this way let's go this way now God said go here go here you'll end here and then now Moses is panicking because the people because he's under the influence of the people because the people are all stressed God Called Moses God had commissioned Moses so the people's opinion shouldn't have mattered to Moses are you following me amen if you are called by God if you have been commissioned by his holy spirit amen if you have who's made him if you have met him you've been commissioned amen so you shouldn't be leaning on the arms of man and man's ideas and what's going on in a trial that's why when the enemy comes in like a flood don't lean on this guy don't lean on someone's opinion you talk to God about it amen cuz when any comes like in a flood he says I'll raise up a standard and you'll find out you're actually that anointed standard hallelujah hallelujah but he was getting all tossed because the people were saying have you brought us out here to die let's go you and he got a word and God and he says God what am I going to do I imagine he wasn't just Cal about it he really cried out and God just says why are you crying why are you crying speak move forward yes just speak and move forward speak to the situation I know the Christian world has perverted that but there's still a truth in it just speak to it and move forward I mean you know God you know sometimes we think he's just going to be it's all right and you come on you being equipped take that rod you mean the shepherd stuff you know Moses comes to the burning bush he's carry I don't know how long he's been carrying this rod for it was the rod of God's Deliverance Hallelujah there was you could say Atomic it was an atomic bomb he was fully primed and ready to go but God had to take the safety off it that's right he had to see what his weapon could do Hallelujah and then so he's carrying this stick and has done many things he's still carrying the same stick and he's crying unto God that's why my God why are you crying hallu what do you got in your hand you understand what I'm saying the shepherd stick without the anointing was just a bit of wood but when it was anointed Hall then it was he was Unstoppable and it's the same thing with this word when this word just ink on paper doesn't do anything but if it's anointed by the spirit of God in your life Amen brother B says when it's Spirit-filled man takes the word of God speaks it across their lips it is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go nothing can stand before that man or say or that woman Hallelujah you say well that's all very glorious that's you that's you Caleb Caleb was a slave he heard a word I have an inheritance now I want it he simple give it to me you're a simple man we should be the same way you see a child you know it's about to be Christmas or birthday time they don't want to wait how many sleeps I remember being a little kid I couldn't the night before Christmas I couldn't sleep I was so excited you know and you'd go up and you'd pick up the presents and rattle them and see what it is you know because it was promised by your parents this is yours right and something in you said I want it because it's been given amen because it's been given I want this present because it's my my name's on it two two Ben from Mom and Dad whatever so my name's on it so why can't I have it now no you've got to wait but I want it no no got to wait no but I want it I wonder what it is this is more than a birthday gift this is more than a Christmas present it's got your name in it it's got your name on it hallelujah amen and we should be the same like little kids can I have it now I want it now I want to know I want to know when's it going to be when's it going to be and then Caleb for 40 years I got a mountain I got a mountain I got a mountain when's it going to happen when's it going to happen Hallelujah I'm going to take it and then finally he comes to Joshua it's now surely it must I've served God these 40 years can I have it now can I unwrap it now is it time is it time he says go take it you got to do the same thing we you understand we have to do the same thing Hallelujah speak and move forward Hallelujah I might just leave it there but I want you to think about it why do we cry God just said you know it's like even even Moses he brings all his complaints to God at the burning bush God doesn't sympathize he just got mad you read the account he was actually angry at Moses oh I can't speak well who made man to speak I can't do this who made man to do this yeah why is it because we think this thing can't do it now this thing can't do it we have to come to that realization this man cannot bring forth the promise of God one bit okay even in our good attentions it takes God in you to do it amen but but the thing is you've got to have confidence if God has called you I mean that he will do it he doesn't just say now now become the bride of Christ and we're like well okay what are we going to do it says in the Book of Revelation that that the bride has made herself ready it was granted to her that she' be a raay in fine linen clean and white which is the righteous of saints so he's got the wedding garments and he calls you then you just got to put on the Garment cuz the garment's cut to fit you the word has been cut to fit you Hallelujah you just got to put it on it's not oh how am I going to obtain to this no Walk This Way here's the showroom or here's the what you know it's there where's my one there's your one there Hallelujah wonderful you following me you know we're not just we're not just stabbing the dark people amen God's called we just have to respond and then he enables you to do what you need to do but he does it we're not called to produce um ishmail and whatever no that was human instrumentality that was human doing but when God came it was was perfect amen and it's the same thing with us amen we're not called to lean on the arm of Flesh God will do it but you got to have confidence he'll do it amen let's just leave it there but we're changed no wait I want to read that a bit more but see the veil's been taken out of the way no no this is this is so vital because we take we can take the message and just oh it's just a bunch of sermons that's Jesus Christ revealing himself in the scripture as Jesus Christ revealed in the scripture he says when that Veil is taken out of the way what's that Veil taken out of the way oh I'm actually a son or daughter of God that's a start of it you begin to realize I'm not from this place maybe I was born in this part of the Earth but this is not my identity amen I am a Christian before I'm in New Zealander even though I love this country but I'm a Christian first I trust you all the same way my identity is not in my flag right my identity is in the word hallelujah that's what it's got to be sure we can be proud of where we're from whatever but that's not that's not the real thing I am not a New Zealander first I'm a Christian Hallelujah and if that is your you know if that is your heart I'm a believer I'm a Christian then it doesn't matter what nationality people are from you'll have a heart for them doesn't matter what culture because Jesus died for all and it won't be all national politics and fighting and this nation this nation the devil's got it all uh wrapped up that's right don't worry about it everything The Book of Revelation says that God put in the heart of those people that his word will be fulfilled God has allowed it he's not in shock he's not in panic mode at the world falling apart and nuclear war on its way he's not panicking he knows where his bride is he's busy with her and a predestinated time when the last name comes it's in the book as manifested comes in we're gone Hallelujah and a bomb can't drum before that happens amen it's not going to be like oh there's the Great Tribulation because God's program is running late and then the bride's called No the bride will be called before so he says now where that Spirit of the Lord is neveress when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away am mean when that heart is turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away and then we all I'm just skipping verse 17 with open face that means unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so saying when the when the Lord unveils your heart but not only unveils you but he's unveiled I mean the Book of Revelation it means the unveiling so it's like a statue with a with a cloth over it and then finally the cloth comes off and you see what the statue is am mean for nearly 2,000 years people have seen Christ under a cloth cuz you can see you see a statue and you see it covered you think well I think it's this or I think he's doing this and you you have a general idea based on its shape people have probed at the Bible they've got a lot of Truth out of it but it took god with a prophet vessel to to take the veil off himself I mean that finally we see that's why the Bible's not a mystery The Book of Revelation is the bride's book amen we know where we are in it we know what the devil's doing we know what God's doing and we know what's happening cuz it's all made plain in the Book of Revelation when a symbol becomes plain it's no longer a symbol it becomes a reality right oh I think it's this now God says no it's that okay I know what it is that's real you know but the reason that is all done is that he would call us out the bride is called out of the church right amen so now when so he so brother Bram is saying is now when we when when the when that Veil is taken off the people's hearts which it has been I trust it's being done so again you know you this morning then we with an open face unveiled face beheld Behold Him The Living Word right and as we are we are changed or transformed into the same image into the image of his word we're made to be like Jesus amen amen and we're changed from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so brother said and the Mighty God unveiled that this scripture pertains to the calling out of the Bride where God would come down take the veil off of our Hearts unveil himself that when we Behold Him in his word right we are changed or transformed from glory to glory hallelujah amen I'm so glad that that you know Hallelujah this is happening friends amen cuz I trust we you say well how does how does that really work well what were you a year ago what were you two years ago what were you 6 months ago amen I trust you're further up the ladder with the Lord than you were back there what happening is you've been beholding the word if the veil has been taken off your heart I mean you've been transformed from glory to glory because youve becoming more like him the things that once bothered you are under your feet hallelujah how you used to react to a certain way you know abashi you're no longer abashi why because you gone from glory to glory as you're beholding him in his word hallelujah we have the can the musicians come I remember that's a part of the calling out of the Bride Hallelujah I'm glad we have an unveiled word in this day amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen let's stand shall we let's sing that song from glory to glory he's changing me I trust he's changing you amen don't be stagnant amen let's go to a not that I can ever sing a key amen let's sing though from glory to glory he's
