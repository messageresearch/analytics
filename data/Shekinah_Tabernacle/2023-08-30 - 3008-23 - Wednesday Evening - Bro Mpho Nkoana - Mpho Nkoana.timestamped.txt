[33:57] privilege and for the opportunity

[34:14] listen tonight is the Lord Jesus that
[34:16] you are here to listen I'm just but a

[34:51] you do for the people of God Amen so
[34:54] we'll be reading the prayer request at

[34:58] believe
[34:59] um brother Armand and brother Ed are
[35:01] ready for me at the back
[35:03] and then we can just go straight into
[35:06] the reading of the word in John chapter
[35:07] 11. amen if you don't mind we can stand
[35:10] again Hallelujah
[35:12] praise the Lord who is excited to be in
[35:15] the presence of God I am happy because
[35:18] there's no better place to be this
[35:19] evening and
[35:22] we we we understand that
[35:25] the word of God was spoken from the
[35:28] beginning and when it was spoken it came
[35:30] out of God it was meant to to create
[35:33] everything and it was meant to bring
[35:35] everything that was in the mind of God
[35:37] to to manifestation amen and so I am
[35:41] looking at what was in the mind of God
[35:43] today before the foundation of the world
[35:46] Amen that was what was in the mind of
[35:48] God what I'm what you are looking at
[35:50] tonight amen let's read John chapter 11
[35:53] then we can sit down verse 21.
[35:58] um
[36:00] sorry let me just
[36:06] um we find the story of of Jesus when he
[36:09] went to raise a Lazarus we know the
[36:11] story right and then we know that he
[36:13] went over there after Lazarus has died
[36:15] but in his map in his view in Jesus
[36:19] Christ's World Lazarus was not dead amen
[36:22] so we're reading the it says from verse
[36:25] 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if
[36:30] thou hasn't been here my brother had not
[36:33] died what Mata is trying to say is that
[36:35] because you were absent because you were
[36:38] not present
[36:39] my brother died but if you were present
[36:43] if you were present my brother wouldn't
[36:45] have died
[36:47] and then let's hear what Jesus says okay
[36:50] mother continues but I know that even
[36:52] now
[36:53] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[36:56] give it to thee amen right Jesus said
[37:00] unto him
[37:01] thy brother shall rise again
[37:05] I just like that kind of statements
[37:07] where there's no maybe
[37:11] where there's no perhaps
[37:14] it's a clear-cut statement
[37:18] I was going to be shocked if I was I was
[37:21] Mother
[37:22] but it sounds like mother knew
[37:25] told Jesus that but I know that whatever
[37:28] you ask God you'll give you
[37:30] let's hear verse 24. Martha said unto
[37:34] him I know that he shall rise again in
[37:37] the resurrection at the last day I think
[37:40] Martha here has just missed the point it
[37:43] is not incorrect for what she's saying
[37:45] it is true however it's not the whole
[37:48] truth what Mata is saying there is not
[37:52] what Jesus was talking about
[37:54] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[37:57] forever okay let's let's go I'll talk
[38:00] about Martha just now Jesus said unto
[38:03] him
[38:04] I am Resurrection I am the resurrection
[38:08] in the life
[38:09] he that believeth in me though he were
[38:12] dead he shall
[38:14] yet he shall he live
[38:17] amen I mustn't pass up to where I'm
[38:19] supposedly
[38:20] and then verse 26 and whosoever liveth
[38:24] and believeth in me shall never die
[38:28] believe us doubt this
[38:31] Believers doubt this mother that's Jesus
[38:34] asking him believe us doubt this what
[38:36] I'm telling you now in other words in Me
[38:38] There Is No Death in me there is no uh
[38:41] oh no yesterday it happened today it
[38:43] can't there's no such a thing
[38:49] um she said unto him yeah Lord I believe
[38:52] that thou art the Christ the son of God
[38:54] which should come into the world
[38:57] would you just join me in prayer
[38:59] Heavenly Father
[39:01] Lord Jesus we lift up our hearts and our
[39:03] hands before you
[39:05] we understand Lord as we read the way
[39:07] that father you made it very clear
[39:10] that you are the resurrection you are

[41:37] just my computer
[41:38] I mean phone or I can use this one can I
[41:41] use this one
[41:42] yep I think I can see something there so
[41:46] this evening I would like us to speak
[41:48] about being present in the presence of
[41:51] the Lord
[41:52] who wants to be present in the presence
[41:54] of God Amen you know there are times
[41:57] when you you are you are there but you
[42:01] are not present
[42:03] ah you are physically there
[42:07] I would say your mind is there but you
[42:09] are not there right that's an awful
[42:12] thing isn't it to be there but not there
[42:18] Jesus Christ was not there
[42:20] but he was there
[42:22] because he if he was there physically he
[42:26] would have intervened in Lazarus would
[42:28] have maybe not died
[42:30] he would have just prayed for him but he
[42:32] went and he delayed on purpose when they
[42:35] told him that your friend
[42:37] is sick
[42:38] he knew
[42:41] right because he knows that his presence
[42:45] it changes things
[42:47] he knew that if I can be there ah my
[42:51] presence is a problem to the devil
[42:54] my presence is the problem that is why
[42:56] he never I don't know did you ever hear
[42:59] that Jesus attended the funeral
[43:01] someone said Jesus never attended the
[43:03] funeral but that's not the dog thing I
[43:05] want to preach here I'm just trying to
[43:07] say that his presence his presence is so
[43:10] important
[43:12] to me and to you and that's what we want
[43:15] to talk about this evening for a little
[43:17] bit and then to understand just to
[43:19] realize how crucial and important it is
[43:22] for us to be present and by the way I am
[43:26] happy to see my two daughters home this
[43:28] evening I heard on Sunday the pastor
[43:30] saying Esther Esther oh Esther is here
[43:32] and I was excited who's not happy when
[43:35] his daughter comes home
[43:37] so Esther and Liz we're happy to see you
[43:40] tonight and and each one of you by the
[43:43] way
[43:43] you are very special
[43:45] I'm not you know that talk that says lip
[43:48] service
[43:49] I'm not giving you lip service
[43:51] I'm saying it from the bottom of my
[43:54] heart
[43:55] that you are very very special
[43:58] sometimes maybe you don't realize
[44:01] that you are very special and you are
[44:03] very important that is why you are here
[44:06] tonight
[44:07] this is the chair that was allocated for
[44:09] you to be
[44:10] but let's go back to the story of Jesus
[44:13] Martha and the sister and Lazarus had
[44:16] had he been here even Martha says Lord
[44:19] if you were here
[44:20] my brother wouldn't have died I'm sure
[44:23] Jesus was saying it was good that I was
[44:25] not here but Martha was taken from a
[44:28] different angle
[44:30] to for Lazarus to be healed physically
[44:32] but Jesus was looking Beyond
[44:35] what Martha was trying to ask Jesus was
[44:38] looking at Lazarus whose Resurrection is
[44:41] going to affect the lives of many
[44:44] maybe it wouldn't have been even in the
[44:46] Bible
[44:48] if Jesus went there and he healed
[44:50] because there's other things I believe
[44:52] that were not necessarily written in the
[44:53] Bible that were not necessary for the
[44:56] Holy Spirit to bring to our attention in
[44:58] the form of the Bible what we have is
[45:00] enough maybe during the been here
[45:04] but let's hear that I want to read for
[45:08] you again
[45:09] a scripture
[45:11] look
[45:14] chapter one
[45:17] 19-20 and the angel answering said unto
[45:20] him this is now the angel of the Lord
[45:23] speaking
[45:24] to a man called a
[45:30] Zechariah yeah
[45:32] and the angel answering said unto him I
[45:34] am Gabriel
[45:37] that stand in the presence of God
[45:41] Gabrielle stand in the presence of God
[45:43] so that means Zechariah the presence of
[45:46] God is with him at the time
[45:49] Zachariah he's talking to Gabriel and
[45:52] telling him Gabriel that I Gabriel I'm
[45:55] the one and I'm the one who stand in the
[45:58] presence of
[46:00] God now listen
[46:02] and am sent to speak unto thee what a
[46:06] privilege
[46:08] someone sent from the present of
[46:10] presence of God to come and talk to you
[46:12] which means that person is bringing the
[46:14] presence of God to you
[46:19] this and show the these sled tidings
[46:23] verse 20. and behold thou shall be
[46:26] dumped because Zachariah did not believe
[46:28] Zachariah doubted the angel
[46:30] Thou shalt be dumped and not be able to
[46:32] speak until the day that these things
[46:35] shall be performed because thou has
[46:37] Believers not my ways which shall be
[46:39] fulfilled in their season it is very
[46:42] very very very
[46:45] dangerous brothers and sisters to doubt
[46:48] what the angel or the spirit of God is
[46:50] telling you because you are in the
[46:52] presence of God it is it is better to
[46:55] believe everything that has been said
[46:57] when the presence of the Lord is there
[46:59] Hallelujah
[47:01] so we don't want to be
[47:03] damp to our mouth to be close our
[47:05] understanding to be shut
[47:07] because we doubted the presence of the
[47:10] Lord
[47:12] psalm 46.
[47:14] God is our refuge and strength
[47:18] a very present help in trouble
[47:21] a very present help in trouble
[47:26] meaning okay let me know Jump Ahead
[47:28] let's read verse 2 therefore will not
[47:32] therefore will not we fear though the
[47:36] Earth be removed and though the
[47:38] mountains be carried into the Mist Of
[47:39] The Sea the Lord of hosts is with us
[47:44] the god of Jacob is our refuge Salah
[47:48] be still be still
[47:53] and know that I am God in other words be
[47:56] sober
[47:57] be be present
[48:00] be focused on on me be still don't don't
[48:03] be if don't be haphazard
[48:06] and know that I am God
[48:08] because to know that he is God to know
[48:11] him
[48:12] is life eternal Hallelujah I will be
[48:16] exalted among the Heathen I will be
[48:18] exalted in the Earth this is God
[48:21] talking to you and to me in the mouth of
[48:24] on the mouth of David now the question
[48:26] that I want to bring to you tonight
[48:28] brothers and sisters is am I present am
[48:32] I present
[48:33] or are you present
[48:37] are you ask yourself that question
[48:40] am I
[48:42] present but not present
[48:44] when the word is being taught you know
[48:46] you know if you hear the pastor saying
[48:48] are you with me
[48:50] yeah everyone is anyone following me
[48:52] tonight or is anyone I had him even on
[48:55] Sunday is somebody with me
[48:58] I asked myself many questions Lord bring
[49:01] me here make me present Lord I don't
[49:04] want the pastor to ask me that question
[49:05] I want to be present
[49:08] when God has descended
[49:11] let me be there because to to ignore and
[49:16] play around with the presence of God is
[49:18] to go down
[49:20] is to be shut
[49:22] be present rather rather not come
[49:27] let us stay home
[49:29] because come to the presence of the Lord
[49:32] you want his presence you want His
[49:34] blessings and he's sure giving them to
[49:36] you for Mahala
[49:38] Mahala means for free
[49:40] he's giving it to me and to you so to
[49:44] come in the presence of the Lord is so
[49:46] important but in the form of preaching
[49:48] when by the way we understand and we
[49:51] know that
[49:52] God is Omni present
[49:56] who knows that word omnipresent you know
[49:59] talking about his his ever present we
[50:02] will see and understand that okay so if
[50:05] God is ever present
[50:07] then then that means it is everywhere
[50:11] right at any time he's omniscient his
[50:15] omnipotent talking about his power
[50:19] he's all power
[50:22] he's all ever present
[50:25] he is now he is omniscient he knows
[50:29] everything he can be everywhere
[50:32] I would like to say he can be everywhere
[50:34] at any time
[50:35] a friend of mine who was not it's not a
[50:37] Believer but he believes in God he
[50:40] trusts God he used to say to me Mr
[50:43] you know we trust in God
[50:45] we trust in God because God can hear the
[50:48] prayers of billions and billions and
[50:50] billions of people at the same time
[50:54] he can listen to each one attempt and I
[50:57] said that's exactly true my brother it's
[50:59] because he is omniscient
[51:01] he knows everything everywhere right now
[51:05] if he is omnipresent right so this means
[51:08] the question is it is for me to get into
[51:11] his presence
[51:13] because I can be out of the presence of
[51:16] God but then because he's present he
[51:18] won't be with me he won't be in me right
[51:20] but the issue is for me because he's to
[51:23] access his presence
[51:25] are we together
[51:27] we need to come to a point in our lives
[51:29] where the presence of the Lord
[51:32] is not leaving us because he promised us
[51:35] there is an enemy whose main job is to
[51:39] drift you away from the presence of God
[51:41] that enemy that we said he's working
[51:44] he's a full-time enemy
[51:46] he's looking for believers and
[51:48] Christians who are part-time Christians
[51:50] he's looking for those ones those ones
[51:52] he's looking for them so that he can
[51:54] manage to take a certain percentage of
[51:57] their lives daily hourly from the
[52:00] presence of God because he knows that if
[52:03] he removes you from the presence of God
[52:06] he's gonna finish up he's got you a lion
[52:09] when it wants to destroy an animal and
[52:12] the animal is in a group of lions it
[52:15] knows that this is a fortress I cannot
[52:17] access these buffaloes even the zebras I
[52:21] cannot access them so it wants to
[52:23] separate you from the presence of the
[52:26] Fortress so that it can catch that's how
[52:29] the devil fights you know the Bible is
[52:31] saying he's going around us like a
[52:32] roaring lion that's exactly how he
[52:35] fights he's looking just to separate you
[52:37] yeah
[52:39] and then you can be there physically
[52:42] but you're not there
[52:45] love your God with all your mind your
[52:48] spirit and your soul
[52:50] 24 7.
[52:52] Hallelujah
[52:54] but now
[52:55] let's let's just understand
[52:58] the way to come in the presence of the
[53:01] king
[53:02] I always give this example about the
[53:04] royal family because you are the royal
[53:07] family I can't help it you are from the
[53:10] royal priesthood
[53:12] you are children of the king so how do
[53:16] we let's think about a worldly royalty
[53:18] because they place it so high
[53:21] so high
[53:23] but it's good for them to do that
[53:24] because it shows us how our royal family
[53:28] came
[53:29] how we should go imagine you know when
[53:32] you go to the presence of the president
[53:34] or the royal family person or whoever
[53:36] there is a process huh
[53:39] there is a process that which you you
[53:41] you go through you know they don't just
[53:43] take you and you go there no even if I'm
[53:46] wearing nice they check me and recheck
[53:49] my credentials everything I can't just
[53:51] go and meet the king
[53:53] there is a process even when I'm there
[53:55] there is a way to greet the queen and
[53:58] the princess
[54:01] I don't know what men do
[54:03] or what what ladies do with their
[54:05] dresses yeah
[54:06] they do that there is a process there is
[54:10] a way when you eat you on the table with
[54:12] the queen and the King you don't just
[54:14] grab your fork and throw the soup there
[54:15] no you there's a way you don't just grab
[54:19] the bowl of salad before leaving the
[54:21] queen candy
[54:22] there is a process
[54:24] there's a way in which you conduct
[54:26] yourself how you chew your food on the
[54:29] table where the queen and the King are
[54:31] you don't just chew anyhow Danny
[54:35] there is no way right so imagine if a
[54:40] wealthy King has got such an order
[54:44] your king
[54:46] eternal life Giver
[54:50] and he's so big
[54:52] he's so big then he realized that you
[54:55] know what the way I'm so big let me make
[54:58] myself simple he said let me simplify
[55:01] myself until he come in Simplicity for
[55:05] us to be able to access his greatness he
[55:08] became simple
[55:10] it's not a human beings are complex
[55:13] but God he's so complex until he's so
[55:17] simple
[55:18] you get it
[55:19] he's so great your mind my mind will
[55:23] never fathom or understand his greatness
[55:27] he then made himself simple simple he
[55:31] became a simple man until
[55:33] they missed him
[55:36] because we are we are too complex as we
[55:38] are complex we are born complex and we
[55:41] don't even understand our complexity
[55:43] ourselves
[55:45] so God became simple
[55:48] so that today we can sit here and talk
[55:50] about how simple he was he was so simple
[55:53] until he didn't have a place of his own
[55:56] if he was in Stokes Valley maybe you'd
[55:58] be sleeping by by the at least Force
[56:00] this weekend next weekend he's sleeping
[56:02] by the moodless the other weekend is by
[56:05] down by the clients or the other month
[56:06] by his friends and then he goes by his
[56:09] sister sister Maggie then the next thing
[56:12] he's going back to her Upper Hutt he
[56:14] goes to then he goes to taita to to
[56:16] Sister Hannah so and then the next thing
[56:18] we hear he's in kapiti
[56:20] he did not have his own place yeah
[56:23] that's how simple he was simple
[56:26] and if you want to be simple these days
[56:28] you are out of fashion you're out of
[56:30] tune
[56:31] you are not moving with the times when I
[56:34] try to be simple my boy says are dead
[56:39] sorry boys
[56:41] so so what I'm trying to say is that
[56:44] there's a process
[56:46] to enter the Royal Family
[56:48] to go to the king that's a process right
[56:51] and as long as you will remain also in
[56:54] the presence of the king
[56:56] and you're going to be in company of the
[56:58] king at all times which means you're
[57:00] going to permanently be that way
[57:02] you are not going to you there's a way
[57:04] we wake up in the morning you there's a
[57:06] protocol even when you stand you say all
[57:10] protocol observed
[57:11] then you can talk
[57:14] huh so there's a way think about those
[57:16] guys who live every day with the king
[57:18] and the Queen
[57:19] they know the process how to greet what
[57:22] the king is what irritates him and
[57:24] everything what he loves and they do
[57:26] what the king loves eventually they
[57:27] behave like they kill themselves
[57:29] they become like the king
[57:32] The King The Queen Is this if the queen
[57:34] says no no blueberries are no good for
[57:36] us for you then then they don't eat
[57:38] blueberries any longer
[57:41] because that's what the queen says
[57:44] so
[57:46] so if you are a king you are in the
[57:48] king's Inner Circle
[57:50] and you are a relative or you are a son
[57:53] or you are a daughter
[57:55] there is a way in which you conduct
[57:57] yourself when you are a member of the
[57:58] Royal Family
[58:00] when you are the son of the king
[58:02] it was only the prodigal son who did
[58:05] what he did being a son of a rich man
[58:07] and he found himself in the picture he
[58:10] forgot he lost his side but one day God
[58:13] restored him so that today you and me
[58:15] can read about it
[58:17] and remember that oh I was like that guy
[58:20] but he has always been a son of the king
[58:23] one day God restored his mind and
[58:26] revealed who he was and he realized that
[58:28] ah
[58:30] let I'll settle for being a servant
[58:33] because even sevens in My Father's House
[58:35] live better than this
[58:38] right so he came back to his senses now
[58:42] talk of General conduct yourself
[58:46] otherwise you bring the king's name into
[58:48] this repute
[58:50] if you don't conduct yourself in a
[58:52] certain way I'm talking about the ethnic
[58:54] King brother Hindi I I'm talking about
[58:56] the Earthly King you can extrapolate it
[58:59] and think about the heavenly father how
[59:02] you need to be engaging talking being in
[59:06] his presence how important how Paramount
[59:09] importance
[59:10] it is to you
[59:12] I'm giving you a perspective of the
[59:14] worldly King
[59:17] imagine how amazing have a specific suit
[59:21] to be to meet
[59:23] the Pope
[59:25] hey a wealthy man who's born like me
[59:29] how much more about the king
[59:32] can you don't you realize that we then
[59:34] which means we are actually
[59:36] we who are called Believers and
[59:38] Christians we are underrating this King
[59:42] every day
[59:44] because now if I can just take you here
[59:46] to Chris's house the Prime Minister I
[59:49] don't know if he lives in apart over but
[59:50] I know it's an Upper Hutt
[59:52] if I can take you to his house now let
[59:55] me go first home and change my my suit
[59:57] if your brother Andy our brother we are
[59:59] just meeting Chris
[1:00:00] no no is the prime minister say yes
[1:00:04] I can't go like this
[1:00:06] because he's a respectable man yeah he's
[1:00:09] the prime minister of a country you're
[1:00:11] going to meet him unless if he told you
[1:00:13] no no Andy let's meet at the gulf then
[1:00:15] you'll also go buy new golf shoes
[1:00:18] and a new t-shirt that can meet the
[1:00:21] prime minister right how much more about
[1:00:23] the king of kings
[1:00:26] how do we address him how do we interact
[1:00:28] with him
[1:00:29] because that is the thing that
[1:00:31] determines and explains his presence in
[1:00:34] your life every day
[1:00:38] being in the presence of the Lord talk
[1:00:40] about being in fellowship with him
[1:00:43] being being in his presence it means
[1:00:46] that you have to be in full fellowship
[1:00:48] with him it's a continuous Fellowship
[1:00:50] that keeps you in the presence of the
[1:00:54] king
[1:00:54] all the time when when what your
[1:00:57] thoughts your ideas your jokes your your
[1:01:01] seriousness your business your work your
[1:01:04] everything
[1:01:05] you everything you want to link it to
[1:01:08] your spirit to any to a spiritual life
[1:01:10] you want to think oh I wonder what does
[1:01:13] my father think about this idea
[1:01:16] imagine I mean even even on the physical
[1:01:19] side Emma when you do decisions you
[1:01:21] think I wonder what Mom will say don't
[1:01:23] you I wonder what Dad will say
[1:01:27] even Gaby she thinks oh I don't think my
[1:01:29] dad will like this
[1:01:31] hey buddy you consider your your
[1:01:33] heavenly I mean your elderly father and
[1:01:35] mother and acquaintances you consider
[1:01:37] their views right but why is it why is
[1:01:40] it so easy not to consider the view of
[1:01:42] our father
[1:01:44] we only tell him afterwards oh thank you
[1:01:46] Lord for helping me to get that job but
[1:01:49] you didn't tell me even before I don't I
[1:01:52] I just saw you going for an interview I
[1:01:54] said oh my son one time you realize that
[1:01:55] I'm right here with him I want to talk
[1:01:57] to him
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:00] now his absence is what makes us
[1:02:04] very very bad his absence his absence
[1:02:08] lead to trouble you can see he was not
[1:02:11] there then Lazarus died
[1:02:13] but if he was there Lazarus wouldn't
[1:02:15] have died didn't you hear Martha Say if
[1:02:19] if God is not ever present in your life
[1:02:22] you are heading for trouble here says
[1:02:25] and and he says where am I
[1:02:29] um and then his PR his ministry got so
[1:02:32] popular that he went and he went away
[1:02:34] and home and then um at any time when he
[1:02:37] goes away from home then trouble sets in
[1:02:40] and you just remember these friends
[1:02:44] these friends you Christians anytime
[1:02:46] that Jesus leaves your home look out for
[1:02:49] trouble
[1:02:50] is on his road to your house
[1:02:52] he must never leave your house and the
[1:02:56] only thing that is going to keep him in
[1:02:58] your house is your fellowship with him
[1:03:00] it's your talk with is that we let's not
[1:03:04] complicate our relationship with God God
[1:03:07] wants you to come to him talk to him
[1:03:11] someone a friend of mine used to pray
[1:03:13] and say papa God Papa you know Papa God
[1:03:16] this this this this Papa you know you're
[1:03:18] addressing him a person to person level
[1:03:21] not all heavenly father who who is and
[1:03:24] synonyms
[1:03:25] talk to him and say Lord you know me
[1:03:28] like the way friends talk you know if
[1:03:31] you listen to maybe uh
[1:03:33] Esther and Tiana talk as friends you'll
[1:03:37] hear that these are friends listen to
[1:03:39] how they talk to each other
[1:03:40] because when you talk to your friend
[1:03:42] when you talk to your dad Dad it's your
[1:03:46] dad you pour your heart you say
[1:03:48] everything when you talk to your friend
[1:03:50] what is called your confidante it's
[1:03:53] called a confident you tell them because
[1:03:55] you have got trust in them you've got
[1:03:57] you've got you you respect their opinion
[1:03:59] you want their view you know you engage
[1:04:02] sometimes you just tell them your wife
[1:04:03] your husband sometimes you just tell
[1:04:05] them just for them to hear
[1:04:08] so what must I do lovey no I'm just
[1:04:10] telling you
[1:04:11] you are just telling me yes because you
[1:04:14] are my husband I believe for God I'm
[1:04:16] telling you for the sake of just telling
[1:04:18] you I'm fellowshipping with you okay
[1:04:20] then the husband catches it
[1:04:23] so what I'm trying to say is that he is
[1:04:27] not to be allowed
[1:04:28] to leave your house including even this
[1:04:31] house
[1:04:32] this house I'm talking about as well
[1:04:34] this house it must be the ever present
[1:04:37] dwelling of the Lord
[1:04:40] halleluia
[1:04:42] you know in the presence of the Lord
[1:04:44] things happen
[1:04:45] yes when when when when when he's
[1:04:47] present listen
[1:04:50] uh
[1:04:51] during the time of brother Branham
[1:04:54] he used to say I'm I'm waiting for him
[1:04:56] waiting for the angel of the Lord to
[1:04:57] come and the angel of the Lord will come
[1:05:00] from his right hand right and he'll say
[1:05:03] he is here
[1:05:04] now
[1:05:06] if you don't pick up what he's saying
[1:05:07] there you're going to miss your healing
[1:05:09] you're going to miss
[1:05:10] what is trying to say he is here meaning
[1:05:12] the presence of the Lord is here for me
[1:05:15] to access now
[1:05:17] that's why some people got healed
[1:05:19] sitting there
[1:05:21] some had to come to the front to be told
[1:05:24] more for their faith to be uplifted
[1:05:26] right now
[1:05:29] we realize that how little we are
[1:05:33] sorry then we realize how little we are
[1:05:36] when we realize how great he is
[1:05:39] and how close we come or in sorry and
[1:05:44] how close we come in for coming to his
[1:05:47] presence somehow or another is always
[1:05:50] throwed a great effect upon people to
[1:05:52] come into the presence of God
[1:05:54] I asked a question one time I said if we
[1:05:57] are sitting in the service like this
[1:05:59] and then
[1:06:01] he just come in his physical body the
[1:06:04] Lord with his gown and you can see that
[1:06:08] oh
[1:06:10] I'm not dreaming and you see all of us
[1:06:13] and he comes and sits maybe you sit
[1:06:15] there at the back next
[1:06:17] or he comes straight to the front and
[1:06:18] sit next to David because I think the
[1:06:20] lord loves to sit in the front
[1:06:23] nothing about sitting at the Backpage
[1:06:26] so he come
[1:06:29] and then he sit here
[1:06:30] right here next door Brother David
[1:06:32] what what do your first reaction be
[1:06:40] and you think you are dreaming
[1:06:42] and he and you check that you are not
[1:06:44] dreaming
[1:06:45] what do you think the MC will say
[1:06:49] Joshua maybe we'll say Lord Jesus is
[1:06:51] that you
[1:06:54] and then all of us will what if you look
[1:06:56] at Joshua anymore
[1:06:59] everyone will want to come and sit in
[1:07:01] the front next to him I think I'll want
[1:07:04] to sit next to you I'll come and sit
[1:07:06] here yeah yeah right here
[1:07:08] and just a lot that man can stop with
[1:07:10] choruses
[1:07:13] because his presence is so important so
[1:07:15] important but he said I'm Gonna Be With
[1:07:17] You
[1:07:18] I'm gonna be with you even in you until
[1:07:22] the end of the world
[1:07:24] but sometimes we find that we lose his
[1:07:27] presence we we lose his acquaintance
[1:07:31] because of other things that come to
[1:07:34] disturb us
[1:07:35] and we don't
[1:07:36] flick back flip back you know flip back
[1:07:39] you know those people who do wrestling
[1:07:40] they push you down and then you just
[1:07:43] that one flies back again
[1:07:50] until we lose his presence we are still
[1:07:53] his children we are still saved we are
[1:07:55] still filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:57] but there's an insomnia of some kind
[1:08:01] there's no contact with the wire
[1:08:04] you are still a fool full full-blooded
[1:08:07] son and daughter of God
[1:08:09] but his presence
[1:08:10] is oblivious
[1:08:13] blurry
[1:08:15] it's blurry
[1:08:18] we don't want to be like that right
[1:08:20] because his active presence
[1:08:23] things happen in his presence
[1:08:27] let's read here and hear what the
[1:08:28] prophet says
[1:08:31] I
[1:08:32] I've seen time in my Ministry when you
[1:08:35] would see the presence of God come in
[1:08:37] into such a place that it will bring a
[1:08:40] person up and just reveal the life
[1:08:43] to them and call out their sins of all
[1:08:46] kinds of immoral acts and bring such a
[1:08:50] holy hush amongst the people till they
[1:08:53] drop out of the prayer line before they
[1:08:56] were before they ever come up to be
[1:08:59] prayed for
[1:09:00] and run to the Altar and and get right
[1:09:03] with God before they come up for his
[1:09:05] presence
[1:09:06] see there's something about coming into
[1:09:09] the presence of God it costs things
[1:09:12] to happen
[1:09:13] I've seen people laying in cars and
[1:09:16] stretches and that changes so that's
[1:09:19] what the presence of God does the
[1:09:21] presence of God things things from under
[1:09:23] the cover and it's so wonderful for the
[1:09:26] things to come and the Holy Ghost to
[1:09:28] bring things from under the cover
[1:09:29] because the devil wants to hide them
[1:09:31] the devil puts things in a bag you do
[1:09:33] something he takes and put in the bag
[1:09:35] he's following you he takes and put in
[1:09:37] the bag you do another one he takes and
[1:09:39] put in the bag and works with you one
[1:09:41] day
[1:09:42] you get in the presence of the Lord you
[1:09:44] want to save God and you speak about
[1:09:47] everything that is here
[1:09:49] that is here that is maybe here in Your
[1:09:53] Vision in the Lord welcomes you and
[1:09:55] forgives you and say my daughter and
[1:09:56] fill you up with the presence and the
[1:09:57] devil just just pull up another one from
[1:10:00] the back and say what about this one
[1:10:02] that's what he does he keep files for
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:06] but the moment you come in the true
[1:10:08] presence of God no sin can dwell in his
[1:10:11] presence everything just that the Lord
[1:10:14] just call at this even grab that back
[1:10:16] from the Devil
[1:10:17] and
[1:10:19] and have you ever emptied their back
[1:10:21] and everything just evaporate in the
[1:10:23] presence of the Lord
[1:10:25] the devil now has
[1:10:27] now has a bag
[1:10:28] that he can hold for you and then you
[1:10:30] live like
[1:10:31] like you believe up now everything that
[1:10:34] happens you you've got a sensitivity of
[1:10:36] the spirit that you you quickly pick up
[1:10:39] that ah the way I spoke to that sister
[1:10:41] Maggie I didn't speak to you right the
[1:10:44] Holy Spirit condemns me I'm sorry my
[1:10:46] sister she says what I have soy so right
[1:10:50] you see because now sensitive to the
[1:10:52] spirit you are now always in the
[1:10:54] presence of the Lord
[1:10:55] ah brother Ben forgive me my brother you
[1:10:58] know I was thinking about this and I
[1:11:00] didn't think right about you would you
[1:11:02] forgive me God want us to be like that
[1:11:04] God wants us to to expose any evil thing
[1:11:09] that wants to take occupants in our
[1:11:11] lives he wants us to be so sensitive to
[1:11:14] the spirit but we can only be like that
[1:11:17] if we remain ever in his presence
[1:11:21] are we together
[1:11:22] I'm I'm closing
[1:11:24] because today is a prayer meeting
[1:11:28] um
[1:11:29] you become humble when you're in the
[1:11:31] presence of God you become obedient
[1:11:33] you become a Nila you know people that
[1:11:35] are called the nilas you kneel too much
[1:11:40] you kneel until your knees are so
[1:11:43] you kneel a lot you are in the business
[1:11:46] of Neurology
[1:11:51] when you are in the presence of God you
[1:11:53] pray a lot
[1:11:58] now
[1:12:00] I want to read at the bottom of that
[1:12:01] paragraph there but when God moved in in
[1:12:03] his presence the patriarch fell on his
[1:12:05] face because he couldn't stand in the
[1:12:07] presence of God when you get in the
[1:12:09] presence of God
[1:12:10] everything about you your ego your
[1:12:12] integrity your status in the society
[1:12:15] falls off that's why you even fall on
[1:12:18] you the the mighty Prophet fall on his
[1:12:21] face Daniel on his Facebook
[1:12:24] because that's that's what must happen
[1:12:26] when Jesus come I'm fled out is him it's
[1:12:30] now him in me right that is why these
[1:12:32] people fell on their face because they
[1:12:34] couldn't stand Moses the man who was
[1:12:36] highly educated
[1:12:38] when he came in the presence of the Lord
[1:12:40] At The Burning Bush experience
[1:12:43] I mean you know to be told to take off
[1:12:45] your shoes is something I only see dear
[1:12:48] in New Zealand and I hear that it's
[1:12:50] because it will make the house muddy
[1:12:53] because maybe it's always raining and
[1:12:55] it's a culture I understand but to take
[1:12:57] off the shoes has got a meaning
[1:13:00] a meaning you know is you take off your
[1:13:03] shoes and stand here
[1:13:05] in my presence because the place that
[1:13:07] you are standing Moses is a Holy Ground
[1:13:10] well taking off shoes could have many
[1:13:11] different meanings for different people
[1:13:13] but what I'm saying is that taking off
[1:13:15] your shoes
[1:13:17] Moses because the place an educated man
[1:13:21] I can imagine that there was some grass
[1:13:23] some Stony things that you couldn't even
[1:13:24] you could even walk like this and then
[1:13:26] and to Bow before God bow
[1:13:29] even the pope bows
[1:13:34] he will bow diseases every time will
[1:13:38] confess
[1:13:39] brother Brian then South Africa he sings
[1:13:42] a song
[1:13:43] he says
[1:13:44] before him you know Krishna even even
[1:13:48] Muhammad bows before him even the devil
[1:13:52] but even covet bows before everything
[1:13:54] will bow
[1:13:55] we need everything that can come in the
[1:13:58] presence of God must bow
[1:14:01] but you see the devil came in the
[1:14:03] presence of God and he was he went there
[1:14:06] as a clown you know a clown
[1:14:11] he didn't really access the presence of
[1:14:13] God he was there as an opportunist and
[1:14:15] God knew so don't come to the presence
[1:14:18] of God like the devil where he comes to
[1:14:20] scout you know what is to fish
[1:14:22] yeah so who are you permitting today
[1:14:26] and God talked to him and say hey where
[1:14:28] have you been God know that in this
[1:14:30] thing's mind is this and this and this
[1:14:33] so he talks to God Taking Chances and of
[1:14:35] course okay you know you go do it God
[1:14:38] and gay that's not coming in the
[1:14:40] presence of God I'm talking about the
[1:14:42] way the Devil Comes no he will come the
[1:14:45] way Daniel and Abraham and Moses come
[1:14:49] the devil didn't come respectfully
[1:14:52] but God still tolerated him because he's
[1:14:54] a tool in the hands of God God wanted to
[1:14:56] use him he says yes what do you want boy
[1:15:00] today our job okay why
[1:15:03] then he
[1:15:05] because you're shielding him blah blah
[1:15:07] you know the story
[1:15:08] okay go get you but don't do one two
[1:15:10] three
[1:15:12] but we when we come in the presence
[1:15:14] armor we come with all understanding
[1:15:16] that we are coming before God who is so
[1:15:20] big
[1:15:21] but so simple to dwell in my little
[1:15:23] heart in my room me and him
[1:15:27] shutting inside that room and telling
[1:15:29] the Lord everything from your heart my
[1:15:31] girl isn't it
[1:15:34] I like talking to people when I preach
[1:15:36] I'm so sorry
[1:15:38] and here he talks about Moses which I
[1:15:41] already spoke to you about
[1:15:43] then I'll jump to this one
[1:15:49] I mean in the presence of God
[1:15:53] how you will you eventually come to the
[1:15:55] full knowledge
[1:15:57] to know him
[1:15:59] not just to know that
[1:16:02] his sister Debbie I know her
[1:16:05] and then you know when we say you know
[1:16:06] someone
[1:16:07] yes you you know you just met them and
[1:16:11] then you just know them that's not
[1:16:13] knowing them but when you know someone
[1:16:15] you can even tell that no I know brother
[1:16:18] Mario that's not him he cannot do that
[1:16:22] I know him and I know that suit you're
[1:16:25] buying him he won't lie this brother
[1:16:27] just just buy some things I wanna give
[1:16:28] this to Mario because he knows him that
[1:16:31] he will like this so that's the knowing
[1:16:34] I'm talking about to know him
[1:16:37] right so you've got to be able to be in
[1:16:41] contact in contact continuous Fellowship
[1:16:43] in the presence of someone to know them
[1:16:47] are we together you have because
[1:16:49] otherwise you are not going to know me
[1:16:52] you are just going to think that you
[1:16:54] know me but you don't know brother
[1:16:56] because you haven't been in full
[1:16:58] fellowship with me just three months
[1:17:02] and you say ah I know this South African
[1:17:05] guy no you don't because you haven't you
[1:17:08] haven't experienced me enough the Lord
[1:17:11] wants us to be with him to be in
[1:17:14] fellowship with him until we know how
[1:17:17] the Lord operates
[1:17:20] every day
[1:17:22] because to know him is life life
[1:17:26] eternal just to know him in the power of
[1:17:29] of his resurrection so to know him as
[1:17:33] your personal savior as the one who has
[1:17:36] filled you with his presence I saw this
[1:17:39] quotation on a sister
[1:17:41] and
[1:17:42] was it sister Landis status you know
[1:17:45] these statuses are good
[1:17:46] I saw it on the sister status I said man
[1:17:48] I'm gonna put this on my slide I just
[1:17:50] liked it he says but to know him his
[1:17:53] life
[1:17:53] to know him as your personal savior as
[1:17:57] the one who had filled you with his
[1:17:59] presence you were there when he it
[1:18:02] happened there's nobody can take it away
[1:18:04] from you there's no one can explain it
[1:18:07] away from you when when when when that
[1:18:10] experience happens to you you'll know
[1:18:13] who he is to me he is Jesus Christ the
[1:18:16] same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:20] until sister Belinda got an inspiration
[1:18:22] and wrote a song and and she said when
[1:18:26] when the battle is Raging and the
[1:18:28] pressure is on when all hell is against
[1:18:30] us and we fell and we fell we and we
[1:18:34] fell we are not strong we feel we are
[1:18:36] not strong sorry I'm not English and we
[1:18:38] feel we are not strong we need to take
[1:18:41] time with Jesus
[1:18:44] we need to worship Him for he won the
[1:18:48] battle
[1:18:49] back at Calvary
[1:18:51] and as she went ahead and says take time
[1:18:54] therefore
[1:18:55] take time with Jesus
[1:18:57] it is the best thing to do to think of
[1:19:00] his good to think of his goodness
[1:19:02] yeah
[1:19:04] the way he sees us through to serve with
[1:19:07] him at his table to have a sweet
[1:19:10] Fellowship take time with Jesus it is
[1:19:13] the best thing to do that's what the
[1:19:15] inspiration of the sister got
[1:19:16] is just fell in line with what I wanted
[1:19:18] to talk about I hope that what I'm
[1:19:20] trying to convey to you
[1:19:23] it's not just passing above your heads
[1:19:26] you're getting the point and the Holy
[1:19:28] Spirit will continue to go and minister
[1:19:31] to you the importance of being in the
[1:19:34] presence of the Lord being present
[1:19:37] Not absent but present
[1:19:40] at school they used to call a register
[1:19:42] when they call your name you say present
[1:19:45] present
[1:19:47] present
[1:19:48] present and they call your name you are
[1:19:51] there
[1:19:51] quietness
[1:19:54] Samson then another friend says present
[1:19:58] and you see you are present but not
[1:20:00] present
[1:20:01] be present
[1:20:04] actively present in the presence of the
[1:20:07] Lord amen I'm gonna jump this slide so
[1:20:10] that we can pray
[1:20:13] and then we have to recognize the
[1:20:15] presence of the Lord today
[1:20:17] so these ones I can share on the
[1:20:19] brothers group
[1:20:21] then you can read them yourselves
[1:20:23] but I'll close with this one
[1:20:28] I often said the greatest enemy I got is
[1:20:31] William Brenham
[1:20:32] he's the one that go that gets in in
[1:20:34] God's way
[1:20:36] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[1:20:39] that gets to a place sometimes where he
[1:20:42] thinks he can do some things about it
[1:20:43] and when he does that shows shows God
[1:20:46] right out of the picture but when I can
[1:20:49] get rid of that guy
[1:20:51] that guy called pong one
[1:20:54] when I get to a place that he is out of
[1:20:57] the way then God come over and do things
[1:21:00] that William Brenham knows nothing about
[1:21:03] Hallelujah
[1:21:06] the last one is this one of being led by
[1:21:08] the spirit
[1:21:10] and now one of the most wonderful things
[1:21:12] of God and the Christian
[1:21:15] the connection of the fellowship between
[1:21:17] God and the Christian
[1:21:19] is that they are
[1:21:23] I can't see that word there
[1:21:26] are so soled of God no no
[1:21:30] I don't know what it is that it's not
[1:21:32] visible on my side
[1:21:34] but uh
[1:21:37] of God are led by the spirit is that
[1:21:40] they are
[1:21:41] that they
[1:21:47] they are the sons of God are led by the
[1:21:50] spirit yes I think that's what he says
[1:21:51] there
[1:21:52] sorry about my bed I should have made
[1:21:54] smaller to be visible
[1:21:57] but the greatest thing I found in a
[1:21:59] Christian Life Christian Life is letting
[1:22:02] the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[1:22:04] and his work is marvelous how many is
[1:22:08] here it's ever been led by the spirit
[1:22:10] let's see your hands oh my that's
[1:22:13] wonderful let by the spirit of God to be
[1:22:18] in his presence to have a sweet
[1:22:19] fellowship with him that's what I wanted
[1:22:21] to convey and to speak to you tonight
[1:22:23] about it might have not come the way
[1:22:25] that I wanted but it's not up to me is
[1:22:29] the Lord maybe somebody picked up that
[1:22:32] ah this presence of God Is So crucial
[1:22:34] and so important for me I must keep the
[1:22:36] fire burning all the time when I think
[1:22:39] when I do things let me be thinking of
[1:22:42] your presence Lord your view about my
[1:22:45] life and what you want to lead me into
[1:22:47] Hallelujah
[1:22:50] let's just come into the time of prayer
