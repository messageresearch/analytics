hallelujah amen thank you musicians amen praise the lord he's a miracle-working god hallelujah amen praise the lord praise god amen let's go to genesis chapter 24. i just want to i actually want to apologize for the last two services i've just made a big you know i get kind of a certain place and then i don't know what hit so i just want to you know i've come to realize that people don't understand what real faith is and so i want to get onto that maybe next wednesday or sunday or something but you know we we need to have a time where where real faith is not human faith not make believe faith god's faith and we know what that is and so but i just want to apologize for the last two services i think the first half were it was going okay but then yeah so i'm sorry about that um uh well no i mean yeah okay sure but thank you but anyway we're in genesis 24 today i want to speak about i did it did it refresh okay sorry so if you want to just throw up genesis 24 and verses 34. um we're going to a bit of a lengthy reading here to end down down to and down to verse 55 i'd like to welcome our visitor god bless you welcome bro hello yeah that's you yeah i trust you feel at home part of the family but yeah god bless you great to have you here today um yeah so we're going to read down to verse 54 here then we're going to go to romans chapter 11. i'm going to read one verse from there so he's so this is eliezer he's speaking to rebecca's family he's giving the report of um of of him being commissioned and seen to find a a bride for isaac abraham's son and he said i am abraham's servant and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he has become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and manservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah my master's wife bear a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath and my master made me swear saying thou shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell but thou shalt go into my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son and i said unto my master pre-adventure the woman will not follow me and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel before thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred of my father's house then shall thou be clear from this uh my oath when thou cometh to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shall be clear from my oath and i came this day into the well i said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to drink water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of a picture to drink and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed to um out for my master's son and before i have done speaking in my heart behold rebecca came forth with her picture on her shoulder and she came down into the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee and she made haste and let down her picture from her shoulder and said drink and i'll give thy camel's drink also so i drank and she made the camel's drink also and i asked her and said whose daughter are thou and she said the daughter of bethul unto him and i put the earring upon her face and bracelets upon her hands and i bowed down my head and worshiped the lord and please and bless the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter under his son and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i might turn to the right hand or to the left and lebanon bethel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee good or bad behold rebecca is before thee take her and go and let her be thy master's son's wife as the lord has spoken and it came to pass that when abraham's servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raymond and gave them to rebecca and he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and carried all night they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master and then one verse just a bit of a context romans 11 and 29 here amen so we go to romans 11 and 29 it says this i'm trust this is a familiar uh verse to to us all very foundational he says for the gifts for the gifts plural gifts and calling one calling of god are without repentance i mean may the lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning so i'd like to speak about the uh gift in and without the body of christ there's a difference between having gifts and being in the body of christ by the baptism of the holy ghost and having gifts outside the body now i'm not going to talk about your spiritual gifts where where where the prophet told us that that gift could just fall upon someone use them once and then move on i'm not talking about i'm talking about gifts that you're born with now notice that we read there in romans now we're going to get to rebecca we're going to kind of do a big big detour and get back there but you know we read there in in in romans 11 said no says for the gifts of multiple gifts and calling one calling of god or without repentance now that means before a person ever repents the gifts and calling of god are there right so they're without repentance you don't get those things by repenting but they're actually there before a person repents now a gift that people are born with gifts right people are born with gifts and and we'll go into it but you can see in the world that there's very gifted people it's not a shock to tell you that there's gifted people and they're not just christian people they are anything people very gifted people but but the prophet of god says this in the deep calls to the deep he says now seeing visions is justice so he's speaking of his own ministry now he's seeing visions is just as common to me as it would be for you to get hungry it's a nature and that's where the churches fail today in many i say it with reverence brother and sister that when we try to do something that we are not we can't make you can't make your eyes blue when they're brown uh who can add a thought who by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature gifts and callings are without repentance people are born to be singers some time ago i was buying my little girl a little piano for christmas she seemed like inclined to be that way me and my wife cannot play either and i was trying to pick out a court on the little thing and a little boy came up about eight years old little shoes on his feet little here needed trimming very bad it was down to his shoulders old raggedy coat he stood and looked at me a little bit and he said what are you trying to do mister i said i'm trying to make this chord so he's trying to play the piano he says let me have it i thought well what would this poor little ignorant child know about playing the piano oh my he was a master with it he was playing anything he wanted to well i looked at him he walked over to one of those little xylophones he picked it up and played it silent night i never heard anything like it and then took about a six or eight inch piece of gas pipe laying there in the hardware store and blowed the star stars spangled banner through that gas pipe i said son did you ever have a music lesson and then he said what's that see he was born a musician it was just a gift to know how to do it it's like tuning that instrument the piano whatever it could be as far as it making a noise it'd be all right to me but the master knows just how to tighten the string there's something in them tells them that that's the way gifts are they're just natural to see a vision doesn't make you well is to help you it helps set the church in its place so he's saying that that little boy was was born to be a musician and when we can see it in our midst you know i could never play any of these instruments like us among us who are gifted you know to do so i could never do it even with all the training the best tutors they could even try and teach me themselves and i think i just end up being frustrated because i don't have it within me the gift i was not born though it could be trained i could be trained to a certain level i'm not gifted in that way so but those kind of gifts come before a person ever repents that they're already laying within them amen so you know brother brown says here he says i've saw visions for 40 something years and it never has failed i saw visions when i was a sinner why it was a gift first vision i ever remember my mama told me of me speaking it to her when i wasn't quite two years old he says you know he said he heard a voice victim said they're going to move and live near a place called new albany and then shortly after that they moved to that place you know you know you know his mother was shocked by that he you know i said you know you're born that way it's a trait that's in you just like you're born with blue eyes or black eyes or brown eyes or what it's something god has done it's just it's the only way it can correctly be it has to come from god not something you made it's what god has ordained to be then if it's of god um then it's of god if you're just bluffing and make it up you're see you're wrong see so it's something that we're born with you can't help it it's just something that begins to express within you someone who wants to play music they just attracted towards music they can't help it right it's just something that's within them they are pre gifts are predestinated of god and this is to every every human being it's this is not just the believers this is to everyone on the earth there are gifted people because they're born you know that way you're just born with it it's without repentance now you know so this is not a shock when i say that there's very gifted people in the world you know these very gifted musicians singers motivational speakers you know people who can make people laugh because remember a merry heart does good like a medicine that's actually a gift now what the person does with that gift can be a very different thing but they but they're placed in the person's life and they'll be will be held accountable because they're all gifted we're all gifted people right we're all gifted but we'll be how to count by how we use that gift who we surrender it to rather if we surrender it to god it will further god's work further god's kingdom but if we surrender it to the devil well it will further his kingdom right so a gift can either bring heaven down or bring hell up amen it depends who we surrender it to so you know just like people who have very gifted your motivational speakers they could you know if that was really a a real to me that's a preaching gift now we know that someone can be very charismatic and just because people can talk till the cows come home it doesn't make them a preacher but right there but there's a gift within that people can speak it charisma now many great gifts that are in the land today actually started off in church they started off in in in in christian circles but then they sold their gift for fame because the devil will try and buy you it depends the value he puts on you but he'll try and buy you a certain way so the lord jesus he put the highest value he could put on him said i'll give you all the kingdoms of the world if you bow down and worship me now he may not put that value upon you but he'll try and give you a little kingdom a little influence among some people it'll sway among friends or a little popularity he will he'll try and give that to you based on the estimation of of of your value to him but you've got to come to a place where you can't be bought because jesus has already bought you i've already been purchased i'm not for sale i've already been sold i've been bought by the blood of jesus christ i mean i cannot be bought amen that's that's that's how we should be hallelujah amen it says in james 1 and 17 sorry i'm tally i'm gonna if you could just throw these up quick um in james 1 and 17 it says this here maybe i'll just start and if you get there well yeah um it says that every good gift if you oh here we go she's quick on the trigger every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning so james is saying every good gift and every perfect gift is from above now i'll say every gift is actually a good gift that's how it's used every gift is good but it's how it's used that's why i said it depends what you surrender it who you surrender it to if it will be used for good or for evil but that's up to you because it's placed within your hand i mean every good gift and perfect gift is from above romans 12 and 3 it says is here because you know everyone has a measure of faith even an atheist actually has a faith because when you talk to them and and and i've talked to quite a few you know as everyone knows i i work in the science field at a biochemistry at university i was there too long to postgraduate study all those things but you know even even the the laws of basic chemistry actually stop evolution from happening down this is before life you know the prebiotic life whatever it's called you know but but the thing is an atheist will actually believe no with enough time it will happen they say no no if you put enough time into the equation then life will begin evolution will happen so what they're basically saying because they cannot prove it is they believe that so everyone has a measure of faith right and do we have that romans 12 and 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but who think soberly according as god hath dwelt to every man the measure of faith so every man has been given a measure of faith doesn't matter if they're believer unbeliever everyone even the devils believe in tremble but the faith they have is not a revelation faith it's an intellectual faith otherwise they'd be saved because they believe right but we'll get into that in a in a future service so everyone has been given a measure of faith i say faith is a gift of god so we all fall into these brackets right so you know if we look into let's just stay in the realm of the arts i think this is quite interesting how brother isaac preached on god being the great director and and already had these notes before he preached it but it's just a bit of a continuation i just yeah it just blessed me saying thank you lord it's not just me rattling around in my little mind trying to conjure something up so let's just stay in the realm of the arts you know it is um you know to be able to sing if you think you're just the gift of a singer that's a good gift to be able to play an instrument that's a good gift to be a an incredible artist that's a good gift because god's an art gods and music the right kind to be an author to be a gifted author that's a good gift right to be a storyteller someone who can make films incredible gift amen being able to make someone laugh is is a good gift a merry heart does good like a medicine he said i'm not very gifted but if you can create an atmosphere where people people come to you or burden but they leave all light and happy you know what that's a gift that's a gift amen to create an atmosphere where people actually their burdens are lifted amen just to have that kind of place you go relax that's a gift amen now all of those all of those gifts that i've just listed they are they're good but it's how they're used it's very important all gifts so so that as i said either bring heaven down or they'll bring hell up right so someone who can ride a you know there's many famous authors in the land today what if they gave that gift to to god and that god inspired that gift what would that do for the kingdom of god someone who's a great artist today what what could that do someone who can you know paint great paintings or put put put videos together whatever what if that was put in god's hands you know the multi-billion dollar industry that's hollywood what if that was put in god's hands the gospel would have gone around the world multiple times you know so because all those gifts are god-given but it's who they surrender them to that matters you know elvis presley actually he grew up in a pentecostal church and and in those days pentecost was actually a real pentecost it wasn't a put on with smoke machines and lights and different things it was actually the spirit of god was moving and brother braham even said that he knew he knew um his pastor so elvis presley's pastor was a friend of his and so how he learned to dance was actually by seeing people anointed with the spirit of god he said those dance moves were actually god it was he saw that first in church where people would dance in the spirit and rejoice but he took that gift and he was a very gifted man but he took that gift and he sold it sold it for a fleet of cadillacs where he could have used it and and and shaken the world with that kind of gift amen for the kingdom of god so he learned his his maneuvers as jerking shaking amen he he he learned it under the anointing of the spirit of god in the church now i've seen i've seen meetings and and people have been dancing and running around rejoicing in the spirit and not and it astounds me that they don't crash into each other but to me it's just god doing it and then i saw that i thought you know what you know what so that what that is on the devil's side is a mosh pit at a concert so so he takes a genuine and perverts it and makes it that but the genuine we had the genuine first amen so you see people jumping shouting rejoicing you say that looks like a mosh pit to me but it's not unclean it's not filthy there's no perversion because the spirit causing it to happen is god amen so we can never ever you know if we're inspired to dance dance amen god made dancing the devil's perverted it to what it is today but god made dancing amen amen he made singing he made rejoicing he made shouting god made it the devil doesn't have claims on that he just perverts anything god has done i mean but elvis elvis we know he he he took his gift sold it to the world and you can just see how the world rapidly changed there by the demon anointing came into his life and spread out into other people's gifts changed the whole of the whole whole world by that demon power of rock and roll moving through the world change the whole place you know but this is not just unique to elvis you know you know the band you too actually started as a christian band they they were part of an evangelical christian congregation most of the band and they actually were challenged when they first started how can you do this music yet be christian so they um if i get it right they they kind of paused for about a week and thought about it then they continued on and see what they are today so they had a great gift and they started off in the church but they sold that gift to the world justin bieber started off in church apparently he's anyway but you know he took that gift look what he's done with it katy perry the same kind of thing they were raised as christian people now i'm just using the whole banner of christianity right but they but they were raised as christians but they took their gift soul to the world and look what it's done to the world so but it but to me it's astounding where people like that or any gift that actually starts in the in the realm of christendom that actually god is allowing to be used for his kingdom but then they sell the gift to the world and the devil uses it isn't it amazing that god just doesn't take that gift from them god just says no how do you use that for for my enemy i'm gonna take that from you no he doesn't do that he allows people to go right on he allows because it's part of who they are that no gift is taken from someone that that walks away from god god allows them to keep it because it's part of them you know and the same thing applies to ministry gifts people are born with them you know brother brown preached a sermon this is in the last part of his ministry he called it anointed ones at the end time and he said that that message was prophecy so he preached it back in 1965 and he says he says this now i've decided or felt led by the holy spirit to speak this morning on prophecy to kind of inform us see it's something that we if we're not informed in something anything happens just casually we should know about this the holy spirit has given to us to warn the people of the comings you know the bible said that god will do nothing except he shows his servants the prophet so he's saying actually what i'm preaching is prophecy you may see it in a small form right now in 1965 because we did with the beetles and and and and elvis and different ones but now it's just spread everywhere so what it was in a baby form there is now in its mature form now and then he would take the scripture from matthew 24 24 he says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that as it were possible if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now he says this jesus saying here this shall arise false christ notice it did not say there shall arise false jesus because who's going to fall for someone standing saying i'm jesus now actually around the world there are people who claim to be jesus christ in the flesh and some people have fallen for it but the vast majority say no i'm not i'm not buying that because the bible says we'll meet him in the air right where physically his physical coming has not happened yet his spirit's here upon the earth sure but his physical coming has not come we're still waiting to meet him in the air we're going to meet a literal jesus the same one that has said in acts 1 we're going to meet him in the air right but so so to be a false christ christ means the anointed or the anointing so many false anointed ones shall come and and and false prophets and if it were possible they'd receive the very elect so so jesus saying there'll be a people that will be anointed but they'll be false anointed now this is now brother abraham said that this is prophecy so we need to see now um if it's prophecy we're living in the fulfillment of the prophecy remember i'm talking about gifts outside and outside of christ and in christ everyone has a gift we're going to come to rebecca we'll get there as i said but we're just going on a detour now but this detail is important now so so notice the lord said false christ shall arise and false prophet now christ means anointed one so be ones who are anointed but they but they are false vessels so the anointing can be genuine it can be the genuine holy ghost falling it's a genuine move of the holy ghost but yet the vessel is false now how could this be it seems so deceiving and it is deceiving but how could it be well the thing is that the gifts and calling of god are without repentance so someone who actually has the gift of seeing visions prophecy interpretation of of tongues whatever it may be they have that before they repent it just has to come into the body right so so god can even allow it to be used but it's a false anointed one but you see now the motive of a false anointed one will always be not according to the word it'll be according to their own fallen nature because their own fallen nature their sin nature they're born with will govern them because they're not converted completely though they may do miracles signs and wonders now the purpose of this is to stop people truly being united with the word christ himself this is the purpose we can see it through through the through the through the bible we can see the first ones if we can take it as janice and jamburus as you know they were the they were the corp magicians of pharaoh and so so moses was inspired he was he was commissioned by god in the burning bush by these two signs i mean you'll deliver israel if they don't listen that they don't hear the voice of the first or the second sign then you'll take the water pour it on the ground and become blood that'll be the third sign judgment starts to happen and so moses goes into pharaoh's court he takes a staff he throws it on the ground and it turns into a serpent now you think that's an incredible thing and it's an incredible thing but then but then pharaoh's magician said well well they saw the genuine be done and then they copied it after the genuine was done first so they threw their their rods down and they turned into serpents also but then moses once swallowed them up and then moses picked it up by the turn to a staff again where'd their staffs go went into this one i've been showing that the devil may do false things or try and copy what god has done but god just follows it up i mean it didn't deter moses but he he could see it was actually just the devil trying to stop the deliverance of israel right it didn't stop him amen it must be the same thing why because moses came with a scriptural uh commission amen because he was the fulfillment of the prophecy given to abraham abraham your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land 400 years they're going to be afflicted but i'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand and his ministry was an answer to that prophecy so therefore he could go down to egypt no matter what the what the problems happened the obstacles that he faced he could go down there because he was he was going down with thus saith the lord and he could come out packing the victory amen so but you see moses did the sign first then janice and jamburus copied and the whole purpose of that was to harden pharaoh's heart to try and stop israel leaving amen because remember the promise for israel in that day is that they would go dwell in the land that was the promised word for their day that was the purpose of the exodus was not just to leave egypt but to go into the promised land so those false anointing ones janice and jamerus they were there and they could copy moses up to a certain point if you go read through the exodus story there comes a point they say we can't do this anymore amen but it was but they resisted the truth so so in second timothy um three and eight says now is janice and jamerris worsted moses so do these also resist the truth men of crop minds reprobate concerning the faith so they had a faith but not the faith amen but they were they were resisting the truth so so he says that so timothy's saying in the last days people like this will come and they'll copy what's already be done the supernatural has already been done but the purpose of it is to resist the truth saying have nothing to do with this ministry it's got you know that person's wrong we're right because look we can do the same thing but what is that that's false if they were true anointed once they would have joined up with moses can we come with can we come well i see god's visited you can we no but they because they were so there so so what they did was genuine it was the same as what moses did but the vessel was false false anointed one they were false christ now how can and then we can even go down let's go down to jesus day if we if we were living there before the lord was betrayed by jew um yeah the lord was betrayed by judas we would have we would have probably enjoyed judas's preaching remember he was anointed he was commissioned go two by two cast out devils preach the gospel you know heal the sick and so he was anointed by the holy ghost he was he was a he was he was actually an anointed christ by an anointed one by the holy ghost and he was sent out and he cast out demons healed the sick preached the gospel and no and so he was a gifted man we would have enjoyed it did you hear what brother judas preached the other day in that village you see the miracle god used them in a mighty way praise the lord that would have been incredible it would have been incredible but you see he was a false anointed one the reason he was a false anointing because he didn't go to pentecost he did not hang around enough to go and be truly united with the lord jesus christ that's why he's a false anointed one and he betrayed the lord we know that but you know so we don't ever want to fall into that kind of bracket but you see he was here to supernatural ministry cast out the devil did incredible things but he wasn't truly born again because he did not go to pentecost but he was an anointed you say he was a false christ right because he loved money more than the word because he was a thief he kept the bag and that's why you know so so he loved something else more than the word and so it's fallen nature cause him to betray the word itself we don't want to go fulfill that i don't believe i'm looking at the people that that that are here for that are you all following me today amen so so a person can preach under the inspiration they can have a supernatural ministry and yet not actually be born again and they can be anointed just like judas was judah sold the word for 30 pieces of silver and people sadly today will sell them out for much less than that as as the apostles would would be there in acts chapter 1 and they had a meeting saying we've got to find someone to replace judas and they would even say for he was numbered with us and obtained part of this ministry so he had part of that holy ghost ministry there i mean before the lord jesus christ was crucified he wasn't just an onlooker he was part of it he was part of the inner circle you know he was active in the ministry his act of getting the word to go out but yet jesus in john 6 called him a devil he knew exactly who he was but the lord to me well i'm not god obviously but he lets people do things but yet he knows he's that that person's going to betray him in the end even call them friend so we have to go beyond just having gifts they've got to go into the body jesus would even say in matthew chapter 7 and verse 20 down to 23 he says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them so the life that's produced not just what's said but the life everyday life that's produced that's the fruit not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven what is the will of the father the word of god amen so he that doeth the word that is the you know that is the will of the father right many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and the thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many mighty many wonderful works then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so now notice this is matthew 7 20-23 if you're looking for it so notice jesus does not deny that they did those things he does not say no you're a liar you never cast out devils in my name you never prophesied in my name he never did many wonderful works he never ever denies that they did those things but the thing he says is i never knew you so i never became one with you amen sure you were anointed you're inspired by my own spirit to do those things in my name but you never became united with me so he says i never knew you depart me ye that work iniquity so these ones they do incredible miracles now i trust you can see i'm talking about today right but we can bring it in down home too i'm not just talking about out there let's bring it in here right so so so people can prophesy in his name and the prophecy can come true they can cast out devils amen what is healing what is laying on of hands praying for someone because of the the devil causes sickness right you cast the devil like that sickness of you know that devil of sickness gets cast out person begins to be made well you know laying hands in different things and have they and in thy name done many wonderful works so we could we could fulfill all that but yet the law can say i never knew you but notice now these people are making an appeal to the lord in that day the great great white throat great white throne judgment day they're making appeal but lord we did all this lord so so basically he's saying he's saying but lord i i i did this and i did this and i prayed this and i preached this i sang this i went here it was all it's all meaning me lord but i've read this much i've prayed this much i've done all these things see it's all i i but someone who so it's all performance they're trying to merit heaven by what they have done but we are not entitled to heaven by what we have done that was never meant to be the picture salvation is not the blood and your own human works salvation is the blood alone amen is by the cross of calvary alone it is not blood and the blood and your good conduct we know we have good conduct but because of the blood right we have works because of what he has done i mean because it's his life living through us amen just but it's not we will never ever be entitled to anything by what we have done that is human reasoning and human reasoning will always fail amen but a true christian can only validate their christian experience because he has saved them he has redeemed them he has washed them in his own blood he's filled them with the holy spirit he has revealed himself to them it's all him him him amen because and i live for him because he first loved me that's a real christian where they can look back and see the person i once was though i may be religious i may know the bible from the cover to the cover but there was a time where i met him and he changed my nature and it wasn't me trying to be the christian he came into me and now he's a christian in my life amen this is not learned behavior it's not adjusting to a social norm of a church and trying to conform to a word no it's a full surrender that he changes your nature transforms your life i mean that's real christianity jesus did not die that you could have a part in your own salvation no it's all him alone amen and that's what that's what a true christian does is it's all him it's all the lord it's not what i have done it's what he has done that matters hallelujah now we can go back into the old testament and we can take the prophet balaam this is the numbers 22 to 25 you want to go read the account now it's amazing here was balaam he was a false prophet had a genuine anointing but but his prophecies are still playing out today now talia could you put up numbers 24 8 and 9 for me so he wasn't a true prophet if he was as i said like janice and generous see he withstood moses like janice and jamers did because remember the king of moab hired him to try and get god to curse israel because the king of moab knew hey i can't send my armies out to fight israel they've defeated others we'll lose too so we're gonna change tactic so he said if i can get someone who is in contact with god and get them to be anointed and inspired by god and to and to pronounce a curse on these people then i've won so he went and tried to hire balaam and at first balaam was told by god don't go but then but then the prince of moab came you know that greater dignitaries came to him with more money different things he says i'll ask again and god tells them yeah you can go now god's first decision was the right one but god will allow your free moral agency to actually go against his will because he's a gentleman he does not force you to obey him you have to surrender to his leadership and many times it's contrary to our own desire see if balaam could lay down his own desire for money he would not be the balaam of the bible amen she says god hath brought him out of egypt now this is him speaking under inspiration here of the holy ghost he hath as it were the strength of it of an unicorn he shall eat up the nation's um eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows now verse 9 he crutched he laid low as a lion as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed us he that curses thee now if you look at the nations of the world there's many nations laying basically their virtually failed states they're in ruin today because they curse israel whether they know what they're doing or not because they've tried to we're going to wipe them off the map we're going to destroy them look look look what's happened to these people they are they are virtually it's failed states broken economies broken generations all these things why because they've tried to curse israel but god threw a false vessel said whoever blesses thee will be blessed and whoever curses he will be cursed that's why there's still some nations that still have a bit of blessing today because they've always been on israel's side but there'll come a time where the whole world will turn against them and we're seeing that in its in its fulfillment so i'm sure we can agree with you i i don't need to go into details of lebanon and syria and different countries this is just you know we'll we'll are aware of these things right so but it's amazing because this was a true prophecy now notice just because he is a false prophet doesn't mean we get our twink out and scrub out everything he said it was still god it was it was a genuine anointing upon a false vessel now we can even go down to numbers 24 1 and 2. i just want to show you this to you just to say just to show i'm not just making up stuff right so numbers 24 1 and 2 if we can put that up there we go and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face towards the wilderness and verse two and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him so as a spirit of god upon him that that caused him to speak so he was a false vessel but he had a true gift as i've said that prophecy you can see the blessing and cursing what he said however many thousand years ago is playing out today because it's still god's word so he had a genuine anointing and god genuinely met him and god genuinely spoke through him but he was a false the vessel was false but the anointing was true he was a true he had a true prophet he was a true prophet but it but but it was in a wrong unconverted vessel now and balaam's whole point of being hired by by by the king of mob is to stop the children of israel going into the land as i said about janice and jamers the the whole pattern of this is it stops the people fulfilling the promise of their day now if we have all this in mind then we can actually bring uh rebecca and her family interview okay so are you all with me okay so now we can bring rebecca and her family interview now as i as we read there all of her family received gifts they were believers because they said the lord has done this thing we can can you speak neither good or bad so they weren't they believed in the lord they all received gifts from eliezer now if you go look into history the post-world war ii healing revival historians say was initiated by the ministry of brother branham and and and if you go look into history when that started in 1946 or 48 whenever it started there there was a massive increase of healing evangelists just in the north american continent about over 200 had 10 revivals and they went around america at its height so there was a there was a great explosion of gifts and the reason was is because the spirit of elijah was poured out upon the earth right and it fell on all kinds of people but the thing is though and many miracles signs and wonders were done but the reason was is because the spirit of elijah was poured out because god was going to call a bride through a ministry just as eliezer gave gifts to the whole family so gifts were poured out but many of these gifts were used for selfish gain trying to be who has the biggest tent who's got the biggest ministry who's got the biggest video i mean tv ministry all these different things all about me me me it was all about personal gain making boundaries different things but the spirit of god never came for that the spirit of god came to prepare people for a rapture aiming to restore a true book of acts worship to restore a true book of acts church to be restored because the age of restoration amen when we go back where the original pentecost happened and where god dwelt in his people once again amen manifested his will through his people amen so now just as just as eliezer was sent to get a bride for the promised son so the spirit of elijah was sent upon the earth i mean to get a bride ready for the promised son now we know there's been a bride down through seven church ages but there's got to be a bride upon the earth that breaks the cycle of death amen that does not die in the faith amen but their bodies are changed while they're alive hallelujah that they are actually restored back to the original faith of the fathers now this post-world war ii healing revival morphed into the charismatic revival whose effects are still going on today so the initiative that was the ministry of brother branham not to lift up a man but say this is what god did now remember eliezer came for rebecca but her whole family and and rebecca received gifts now some people don't want to be the anointed one in the end time because i think it's just false anointed ones in the end time but there's a true anointed one in the end time the bride is anointed the bride is gifted i mean we're gifted not just these four walls around the world the bride of christ is a gifted woman and she's been gifted by through the hands of the anointed servant amen the spiritual gifts are within her god is still manifesting people don't want to be the anointed one no no everyone is anointed in the end time they're either anointed by unbelief by by their culture by tradition just by church entity a religious spirit or they have the spirit of god amen so we want to we want to still be anointed we must be anointed we're not here just to go through a lecture christianity's a supernatural life it's not a natural life the atmosphere you carry around you as a believer is supernatural it's contrary to this world's atmosphere amen where this atmosphere of the world is just lukewarmness indifference not caring that's not within us and it's not you trying to be on fire god makes the fire why because the atmosphere that you carry hallelujah so now see some people don't like me to say this kind of thing that you know brother brown had an eliezer ministry because it's the holy because they say well it's the holy ghost hunting the bride that's true but god uses men god always uses his body because of he didn't you know because you even you look at peter there's cornelius that about gentile praying in his house he's a he's a devout jewish way he's a what do you call it a someone who converts i can't i can't find the word right now but you know he believed in the jewish faith they were gentile an angel appears to him says cornelius your arms and your prayers have gone up before god now go get peter he'll tell you the words of eternal life why didn't why did the angel just just give him the holy ghost because god uses the body god uses his people upon the earth you've got to realize that you and god he's actually connected you with his program he said well god's greater than yeah but he's connected you with this program god god has no hands on the earth but your hands no eyes but your eyes no feet but your feet no mouth but your mouth upon the earth amen that's why the angel said go get peter he'll show you the words of eternal life and peter preached them and why it's peter spoke these words the holy ghost fell upon them and they are sealed into the kingdom so god uses man hallelujah now it is true that the holy ghost is hunting a bride but he works through his body and i'll say this he's still giving an alias a call today i mean because the same inspiration is now on a five-fold ministry it's also on you amen why do we go about this why do we go about our daily walk it's an eleazar call to people whosoever will let them come come drink of this water of life that flows amen that will give you eternal life that will give you rest and it will give you a peace in your heart it'll change your life it'll change your world come and drink amen that's what we do don't we that's the life we love that we want to see others meet the same jesus see others fall in love with him like we have all this joy that i had if you could only you can have it if you want it hallelujah because the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away amen so rebecca and her family believed in god because laban and bethel said this thing proceeds from the lord we cannot speak unto thee good or bad remember eliezer gave the gave the testimony that abraham said the angel of god will go before me hallelujah so it was a supernatural meeting there's a divine meeting at the well and he gives the whole thing and you know he didn't say to rebecca you know the angel of god has come before you and this is you know come before me and this is why you're doing this but he just asked can you give me a drink and she just feels inspired oh i'll give you a drink and also water your camels and and he she has no idea that she is fulfilling a prayer that was in his heart and actually she's being moved by the inspiration of god because the angel lord went before him what to do to prepare her heart to receive the message that she'll go and be married to isaac hallelujah so you've got to see that your life is bigger than what you think amen but god went before to prepare you that when you hear his true jubilee call the true gospel you receive it amen and become one with him i mean but now notice now the similarities between rebecca and her family cease right there the only similarity is sure they're family but also they all receive gifts but now but notice only rebecca married the bridegroom so they had their gifts the mother the the you know her family had gifts and no doubt they would have enjoyed those gifts but eliezer was sent for a bride he was not sent just to send out gifts he was after an elected woman that's that was the purpose in his heart to find her find me a find a bride for my son the father said abraham said amen so only rebecca married the bridegroom amen only she became mrs isaac amen she was no longer after she married isaac she was no longer rebecca of naha amen her old identity was gone when she married isaac and it's the same thing with you and i when you become one with christ by the true baptism of the holy ghost your old identity is gone amen it's washed in his blood god in the sea of his forgetfulness you may be living in the same body but you're a different person someone says about your past you say hold on that guy died that guy died sure sometimes we're gonna talk about our past if it's actually still affecting us but why should we be and and then we can deal with it right but why be haunted by a memory and that memory is associated with a different person it's not even you it was your old man it's your old nature but that person dies hallelujah so the devil comes against you with your memory so hold on i didn't do that he says yes you did no no no that was the old me he died he died he really died i didn't just turn over a new leaf satan but you were dethroned out of my heart amen and the lord became the king of my life i became a new creature i'm not patched up we're not a patched up people we're a new creation amen not a not one made over a new one i mean that's why the things you once do you can't do i mean the things you once did rather you can't do them no more as i've given the simple illustration of when i was a child i couldn't stand broccoli so things i couldn't stand now i eat because something happened within me hallelujah but now praise the lord eat your greens children and adults it'll do you good but you see things you once did and you loved because when the lord changes your nature changes you you can't go back there as i said i used to make home brew different things i could live in a brewery now and be sober because it's not within me to want it it's gone the desire left all those things and and you say where did it go i don't know he took it from me though that's all that matters hallelujah amen so we are not a patched up people we are a new creation amen hallelujah so her old identity her old life was gone when she married isaac but her family stayed in the land only she got on the camel and left they didn't they all got gifts they stayed there hallelujah and brother ram says that because those camels carried her to her isaac and the same holy ghost that we water with praise and thanksgiving will pack us to our bridegroom hallelujah amen so now see uh paul would say in romans 4 and 8 blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin so he doesn't impute sin to your new self that's to your old self and that's gone under the blood of jesus christ amen we have a perfect lamb that he gave his life to totally remove sin and he doesn't remember it no more it's in the sea of his forgetfulness hallelujah he doesn't put it in a jar or he does not save he does not archive your old life for later it's gone and uh and the forensic i.t guy that the devil is to try and find that deleted file he can't find it doesn't matter how back he goes back the iterations it's not there because the blood of jesus christ annihilates it hallelujah it's totally gone amen so now only the true believer has a name changed from church to bride remember within christendom there's a church in the bride right so that's why brother i'm sitting the first seal i'm going to call you bride now so you'll understand amen so now now it's only the true believer now as their name has changed from church to bride just like rebecca went from rebecca to mrs isaac amen so now notice now her family none of them left the land and went into the promised land and this is very significant we'll come to it soon they stayed right there in the world and enjoyed their gifts though they were religious they said they believed in god they had church different things they had those gifts now but they stayed right there so none of the others left only rep now this may be very elementary it's obvious of course rebecca got on the camel and left but where she traveled to is very significant i mean because the promised land was more than just a land flowing with milk and hunting it was more than a nice well-watered land they had that in goshen right so it was more than just nice rolling hills and nice places to live and being free from task masters the promised land is more than that because in that promised land is a resurrection i mean that was the most important thing when when abraham had to find a bearing place for his wife sarah he went to the sons of heth and he and he said oh i need to buy a bearing place and he and it says in the scripture i don't have it but in genesis he stipulated the boundaries of that land so therefore the sons of heth after the purchase was done could not could not make a land dispute happen and said no no hold on it's not this but it's this but no no he he ordained the boundaries he said listen we've got to get this right within this boundary is the bearing place outside this boundary is not the bearing place and because he had to find a place to bury his beloved bride hallelujah so so he paid the price in full that she could be buried in that land now jesus when he died on calvary he purchased our salvation in full amen he he gave the boundaries of the land he paid it in full that when the devil came along to try and say hold on peter james and john i've got claim on them jesus could say hold on no no no no i purchased their salvation and their redemption and full amen though they have gone the way of the grave they're mine they're not yours devil they're mine and i say bury me in christ don't bury me in a church don't bear me in man's ideas bear me in the lord jesus christ the word that's where i want to be buried i mean that's why joseph would would be inspired he'd say to his son say to us say to his descendants don't bury no jacob said to joseph rather don't bury me here and then joseph said the same thing don't bury me here because remember joseph could have built the biggest biggest uh mausoleum tomb for his father because he was the right hand of pharaoh but jacob told don't bury me here sure the tombs are fine sure the pyramids are nice but don't bury me here bury take my body and bear me up in the promised land why because being a prophet he could see there was a resurrection in that promised land and joseph he said to he said to the people concerning his bones don't don't leave me here god's gonna take you one day when you do don't leave my bones take my bones with you and bury me in that land why because there's a resurrection in that place hallelujah so now here comes here comes rebecca and she leaves she leaves where she was with those gifts she comes she becomes united with isaac and she is now buried in the promised land hallelujah this is the big difference to me is that it's not it's can you put up uh genesis 49 30 for me and then we'll just kind of wrap up with this but you see to me this is the biggest thing she became united with isaac she became mrs isaac though they are all gifted the rest of her family stayed outside the body but she went into the body of christ amen and she left there she left her old life behind she went into the promised land she lived in that land may i live in the word am i living the anointed word for our day we have a promised land i mean sure there's lots of nice places in the in the world like egypt but no no bury me in christ amen hallelujah do we have that genesis 49 and 30. amen and then she was buried in the same place as abraham isaac and jacob hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and i here we are in the cave that is in the field of machpelah this is this is where abraham bought the bearing place it says it here which is before memory in the land of canaan which abraham brought with the field um uh with the field of of of ephraim the hittite for a possession for a bearing place there they buried abraham and isaac's wife there they buried um so there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebecca's wife and there i buried leah so this is this is um it says there they at the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth now verse 33 and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet to his bed yield up the ghost and was gathered unto his people so he's saying now that rebecca was buried in the same place hallelujah and then when jesus came forth he says many of the saints arose with him matthew 27 who was that that was rebecca abraham isaac and jacob many of them arose walked about the streets about 40 days and went out with him at at his great ascension hallelujah that's why i say sure you can be gifted but fully surrender your life to the lord and allow him to put that gift into the body well how do you do that it's very simple you repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ remission sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost not just to be anointed now but to be sealed to the day of your redemption i mean false christs are just anointed they have an anointing but their soul is not changed right but a true person is anointed and their soul is changed and god abides in their soul makes him a new creature in christ so may we be like rebecca god's poured out gifts in this age we're born with them as well but may when we heard the eliezer call don't just use your gift and run around do what you want with it no surrender to the lord get a allow the holy ghost to take you to the bridegroom hallelujah that's what uh the true seal of the holy ghost unites you with the bridegroom the anointed word hallelujah amen so praise the lord hallelujah that's the difference i want to be in the land i want to i
