[11:30] and we're expecting to be refreshed and
[11:32] renewed
[11:33] and we know that we were approaching a
[11:36] good god this morning
[11:38] a god that that
[11:41] didn't have any reason to come
[11:43] and do anything for us outside of the
[11:45] fact that we would benefit from it
[11:48] which actually is love
[11:50] when you boil it all down
[11:53] that's what love is is is actually doing
[11:55] something that is of no benefit to the
[11:57] person doing it but it only benefits the
[11:59] person receiving it true love is that
[12:01] you know when when we waited all up we
[12:03] there was nothing really that the lord
[12:05] would say okay i've got a good reason to
[12:06] do this that's going to benefit me but
[12:08] we're so grateful that that's the god
[12:10] that we serve
[12:11] that he did it all to benefit us and
[12:14] we want to come
[12:16] gratefully this morning to the throne of
[12:18] grace and

[48:04] i would ask the lord lord can you send
[48:06] the rain away and it would go away
[48:08] hallelujah and then when i came back to
[48:10] new zealand i asked my mum how the
[48:11] weather is and things and she said it's
[48:13] just
[48:14] the roads are like rivers because when
[48:16] it rains there it rains there
[48:17] you know so i know the master of the
[48:19] wind i know the maker of the rain
[48:21] hallelujah and not just those kind of
[48:23] storms he can cast away but spiritual
[48:25] storms as well
[48:26] amen but our god lives
[48:29] hallelujah let's go to genesis 24. uh
[48:31] we're going to read verses 61 down to 65
[48:34] then we're going to zechariah chapter
[48:36] four
[48:40] hallelujah
[48:42] this is here in genesis 24 and verse
[48:46] 61.
[48:48] and rebecca arose and her damsels and
[48:51] they rode upon the camels and followed
[48:54] the man
[48:55] and the servant took rebecca and went
[48:57] his way and isaac came from the way of
[48:59] the well the harori for he dwelt in the
[49:02] south country and isaac went out to
[49:04] meditate in the field at the even tide
[49:07] which is the evening time and he lifted
[49:09] up his eyes and saw and behold the
[49:11] camels were coming and rebecca lifted up
[49:13] her eyes and when she saw isaac she
[49:16] lighted off the camel for she had said
[49:18] unto the servant
[49:20] what man
[49:21] is this
[49:22] that walketh in the field to meet us
[49:25] and the servant had said it is my master
[49:27] therefore she took a veil and covered
[49:29] herself
[49:31] hallelujah and let's go to zechariah
[49:35] 4
[49:38] and verses 6 and 7.
[49:54] and he answered
[49:55] and spoke unto me saying
[49:57] this is the word of the lord unto
[49:59] deservable
[50:00] saying not by might nor by power
[50:03] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[50:06] who art thou o great mountain before
[50:08] zerubbabel thou shall become a plane
[50:11] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[50:14] thereof with shoutings
[50:16] crying grace grace unto it it's not the
[50:19] headstone crying grace grace it's those
[50:21] that receive him
[50:23] because the headstone is not a piece of

[53:09] your seats this morning i'd like to
[53:11] speak i just want to take this one um
[53:15] uh this one question that uh
[53:18] that that rebecca asked eliezer and when
[53:21] i first you know this
[53:24] we could really just think about this
[53:27] she asked the question what man is this
[53:30] that walketh in the field to meet us
[53:33] now we know that the book of genesis is
[53:35] the shadow of the new and you know the
[53:37] lives of the believers are acting out
[53:39] god's great plan of redemption and you
[53:40] know so so we can see these things but
[53:43] when you when we really think about
[53:45] you know because we're not meeting just
[53:47] a man
[53:48] we're not just meeting a man we're not
[53:50] just meeting a prophet but it's a very
[53:52] lord of glory made flesh the very king
[53:55] of the universe
[53:56] the high king of heaven i mean he has no
[53:59] he has no peer he has no equal i mean
[54:01] he's the god of the universe i mean the
[54:03] devil's nothing in his sight i mean is
[54:05] the all-conquering almighty god who made
[54:07] heavens and earth amen that came to
[54:09] redeem you and i i was a very god who
[54:12] made all things he said let there be sun
[54:14] moon and stars and there is hallelujah
[54:16] and when he was sinking when he was
[54:17] creating or singing a view in the back
[54:19] part of his mind or in his heart rather
[54:21] was you and now you're expressed upon
[54:23] the earth and then he's revealed himself
[54:25] to you and you know we're on this
[54:26] journey but when you think you think
[54:27] because we're going to meet the lord
[54:28] halfway
[54:30] hallelujah just like just like isaac he
[54:33] you know he came halfway he he met
[54:35] rebecca halfway in the field in the
[54:37] evening time
[54:39] hallelujah and and she asked the
[54:41] question what man is this
[54:43] that walketh in the field to meet us
[54:45] hallelujah i think you could spend the
[54:47] rest of your life pondering that
[54:49] what is this this this great man
[54:52] hallelujah that's advancing from glory
[54:55] brother man says in the seals he says
[54:57] you know how the lamb takes the book
[54:58] advances from the eternities you know he
[55:01] said if you just lay aside your sin
[55:03] sinful thoughts i mean the lamb will
[55:05] advance all the way for eternity to you
[55:08] hallelujah so just lay aside your
[55:10] problems and what's going on in your
[55:11] life and you're hurting your pain
[55:13] whatever baggage you're carrying just
[55:15] drop it
[55:17] think upon the lord
[55:18] and he can advance all the way from
[55:20] glory to you
[55:22] today in this service
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:26] amen what man is this
[55:28] that walketh in the field
[55:31] hallelujah
[55:32] amen our god is gathering a people and
[55:35] we happen to be part of that number
[55:38] hallelujah
[55:39] amen so now
[55:40] he says here on earnestly contending for
[55:42] the faith it was once delivered to the
[55:44] saints remember it was isaac that wanted
[55:46] a wife when the father abraham sent the
[55:48] servant out a very beautiful type of god
[55:50] the father sending out
[55:52] for his bride to get his bride his
[55:54] servant the holy spirit eliezer it was
[55:56] in the call of the evening when the
[55:57] beautiful rebecca came out to water the
[55:59] camel he says
[56:01] you know the story
[56:03] and then he comes down into the end of
[56:05] his ministry and he's and he's and he's
[56:07] having these different dreams about
[56:08] being back in the public service company
[56:10] different things and he's running what's
[56:12] going on he says and i close my eyes
[56:14] and just let the bible fall open put my
[56:16] finger on the scriptures genesis 24 7
[56:19] eliezer abraham's faithful servant the
[56:21] model servant of the bible being sent to
[56:23] hunt the bride for isaac chills run over
[56:26] me sure that's my that's right with the
[56:28] rest of my message pulling out the bride
[56:31] he said swear that you'll not take a
[56:33] bride out of these but go to my own
[56:35] people
[56:36] we're made of a different material i'm
[56:38] not talking about our nationality our
[56:40] skin color our accent whatever that's
[56:42] not the material i'm talking about but
[56:43] we're made out of different material
[56:45] than that than other people and i'm just
[56:47] thankful that god made me out of a
[56:49] different kind of material because i'm
[56:51] the kind of material because rebecca was
[56:52] actually family was blood relation to
[56:54] isaac i mean and by the blood by the by
[56:57] the sea gene of god we are family we are
[57:00] blood relation to the lord of glory
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:04] amen i'm glad about that
[57:07] hallelujah
[57:08] this should just take all the blues away
[57:10] you know you think about this as you
[57:12] just take all the blues and troubles
[57:14] you know hallelujah
[57:16] amen
[57:17] yeah hallelujah now
[57:19] where are we yes here we are okay see
[57:22] then you're free of this oath i mean
[57:24] what if the woman won't come with me
[57:25] then you're free of the south he said
[57:26] and the god of heaven will send his
[57:28] angel before you to direct you he went
[57:31] straight out and began praying and he
[57:33] met the beautiful rebecca that became
[57:34] the bride of isaac just a perfect
[57:36] message back to the word go get that
[57:38] bride that's a duty that's what i'm here
[57:40] for that's what i'm trying to do is to
[57:42] call out a bride so i understand that
[57:44] elias is not just a holy ghost but it's
[57:47] also the prophet's ministry amen he was
[57:50] sent he was given all the gifts of the
[57:51] father was bestowed upon a ministry and
[57:54] he was sent to the earth go find my son
[57:57] a bride go find the right kind of woman
[57:59] not just any woman but the woman the
[58:01] elect lady
[58:02] hallelujah so he had all the gifts and
[58:04] even even gave some of those gifts
[58:05] because he gave some of the gifts to
[58:07] laban and the denominations they tried
[58:09] to you know explain it yeah you just
[58:11] read genesis 24 and you parallel with
[58:12] the prophet's ministry just perfectly
[58:14] you know so much of his ministry he
[58:16] tries to explain the gifts just like
[58:17] eliezer spent time and explained it to
[58:19] laban well you know abraham is my as my
[58:23] mastery and he has a son and now i've
[58:25] come to get a bride for him and now i'm
[58:26] here and the angel lord sent me here and
[58:28] these are the two gifts god commissioned
[58:30] me to take the healing gift of healing
[58:31] to the world one's in my hand amen one
[58:34] i'll know the very secrets of the
[58:35] thoughts and tense of the hearts begins
[58:36] to try and explain the gifts and the
[58:38] denomination tries to try to hold on to
[58:40] rebecca tried to hold on to the bride
[58:42] because the church was being blessed
[58:44] when the bride was among her
[58:46] amen
[58:47] but then there had to come a time where
[58:49] where eliezers are saying no no we can't
[58:51] we can't just stay in this holding
[58:52] pattern we've got to leave i mean
[58:54] because it's got to be uniting taking
[58:56] place between isaac and rebecca
[58:59] hallelujah amen and so now here we are
[59:02] we're in that story now when i talk
[59:05] about a uniting we are united now by the
[59:08] true baptism of the holy ghost you're
[59:09] one with christ now but there's going to
[59:11] be a meeting in the air
[59:13] right so when i talk about the uniting
[59:14] don't think i'm putting it off some
[59:16] other time but we're united now
[59:19] amen
[59:21] hallelujah and really if we if you look
[59:23] in genesis 24 this is actually god's
[59:26] focus right now in this earth
[59:28] it's the evening time
[59:30] he wants his bride home
[59:33] the journey's almost it's been 2 000
[59:35] years the bride has been journeying
[59:37] because it's not just us that are the
[59:38] bride of christ but all the elect down
[59:40] through the seven church ages is the
[59:42] bride and they'll come forth brother
[59:44] abraham said that the same attitude and
[59:46] spirit they died with they'll come forth
[59:47] that same way
[59:49] it'd just be like a moment them like
[59:50] they blinked and now they're back again
[59:53] hallelujah i mean the apostle paul will
[59:55] still be the apostle paul i mean
[59:57] iranians will be arrhenius martin
[59:59] polycarp all them and the them under the
[1:00:00] messages they'll be the same kind of
[1:00:02] people
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:05] amen so now but it's now the evening
[1:00:07] time
[1:00:08] it's the evening time of time it's the
[1:00:10] evening time of the seventh church age
[1:00:12] there's no more church ages after this
[1:00:14] there's no time will be no more
[1:00:16] soon
[1:00:17] hallelujah
[1:00:18] time just can't go on sure we plan for
[1:00:20] the future but there is no future
[1:00:24] but we should plan for the future
[1:00:27] amen but time has run out
[1:00:30] brother abraham said if he knew he said
[1:00:32] that if he knew jesus was coming in the
[1:00:34] morning he'd get up he'd go to church
[1:00:36] he'd preach all the same
[1:00:37] amen if he knew his coming in the
[1:00:39] afternoon he'd go to work do everything
[1:00:40] all the same i don't know how you do
[1:00:41] that that's what he said you do
[1:00:43] right so he's just keep keep on keep it
[1:00:45] on
[1:00:46] but keep watching and waiting
[1:00:49] amen if it's not today it'll be tomorrow
[1:00:51] if not tomorrow be the next day if it's
[1:00:52] not the next day i'll be the next day
[1:00:54] after that
[1:00:55] but there will come a day
[1:00:57] the day we are looking for
[1:00:59] amen to see the lord face to face
[1:01:02] hallelujah there won't be any veil any
[1:01:04] dimensional difference between us amen
[1:01:06] but we'll be where he is
[1:01:08] hallelujah i'm looking for that day
[1:01:12] amen brother braham says now here in
[1:01:14] this
[1:01:15] so
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:17] now
[1:01:18] this people we are represented in
[1:01:20] rebecca
[1:01:21] who made their decision i'm going to
[1:01:23] follow this word because i know in my
[1:01:26] soul that there's a power within it to
[1:01:27] take me into glory
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] he says in time of decision and it was
[1:01:33] in the evening time when isaac had
[1:01:34] wandered from the tent out into the
[1:01:36] fields to meditate and then he seen the
[1:01:38] camel's coming rebecca looked at him and
[1:01:40] then it was love at first sight she had
[1:01:42] to believe it before she went
[1:01:45] faith cometh by hearing she didn't know
[1:01:47] what the man looked like and it didn't
[1:01:48] make no difference it was god making the
[1:01:51] decisions
[1:01:52] it was god making the decision in her
[1:01:54] it's more than just a you know it's more
[1:01:56] than just a who wants to make a decision
[1:01:57] for christ like a top two inches mental
[1:02:00] it's more than that it's god that
[1:02:02] actually makes a decision you've got to
[1:02:04] yield to that decision but you know it's
[1:02:06] god because god chose us before we chose
[1:02:08] him
[1:02:09] and if he chose us he can't unchoose us
[1:02:12] right because god makes up his mind he
[1:02:13] can't change his mind he can't change
[1:02:15] his mind about his word i mean he can't
[1:02:17] change his mind about his election
[1:02:19] hallelujah and that gives me that makes
[1:02:22] me happy because even in spite of my
[1:02:24] humanity and my failings and my
[1:02:26] quirks and
[1:02:27] whatever bits you undescribe he still
[1:02:29] loves me
[1:02:31] hallelujah and we should love each other
[1:02:33] if he loves me i should love you and if
[1:02:34] he loves you you know how it works
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:39] amen i so get stuff mixed up sometimes
[1:02:41] anyway you know what i mean though if if
[1:02:43] he loves you
[1:02:45] and he loves me we should love each
[1:02:47] other
[1:02:50] now
[1:02:51] he says i don't care whether he's big or
[1:02:53] little what color he is that makes no
[1:02:54] difference to me he's my lord i'll love
[1:02:57] him when i see him because he's god's
[1:02:59] gift to me and to you
[1:03:01] she lighted off the camels she had the
[1:03:03] veil over her face and as her lovely
[1:03:05] eyes caught the eyes of isaac into her
[1:03:08] into his
[1:03:10] arms he into his arm she went and took
[1:03:14] her to the mother's place or the
[1:03:16] father's place and married her brother
[1:03:18] listen there's no time to linger it's
[1:03:20] time to make the decision
[1:03:22] what kind of effect i've underlined this
[1:03:24] what kind of an effect has the message
[1:03:26] made on you
[1:03:28] what kind of effect has this message
[1:03:30] made on you amen it's made you more than
[1:03:32] a church member it's made you more than
[1:03:34] just a religious person made you more
[1:03:36] than just a group of people i remember
[1:03:38] this message just quickened your soul
[1:03:40] and it made you a new creature in jesus
[1:03:42] christ that's the kind of effect amen
[1:03:44] it's actually turned your life i mean
[1:03:46] you're headed towards destruction but
[1:03:48] then god interrupted the devil's plan
[1:03:50] turned you back around i mean you
[1:03:51] started walking towards glory that's the
[1:03:53] kind of effect amen it's had on you
[1:03:57] hello even kant it was contrary to our
[1:04:00] nature we're born with because it says
[1:04:02] in the bible not one seeks after god
[1:04:04] it's not even in man
[1:04:06] but god overrides that
[1:04:08] by election because it's deeper because
[1:04:10] salvation is deeper elections deeper
[1:04:12] than just our flesh even our mind our
[1:04:14] spirit it goes down to the soul
[1:04:16] hallelujah
[1:04:18] amen and god calls
[1:04:21] hallelujah so what kind of effect it
[1:04:23] saved me from hell
[1:04:26] i don't have to go to i don't have to go
[1:04:28] into a tribulation
[1:04:29] that's the kind of effect this has had
[1:04:31] even to say you know this the effect
[1:04:33] this message has had on me is i'm
[1:04:35] sinless
[1:04:36] i'm virtuous
[1:04:38] i'm as holy as god as holy because i
[1:04:40] have god's holiness because of his blood
[1:04:43] hallelujah don't wrestle just say yes
[1:04:46] because it's what god has done not what
[1:04:48] you think you have done it's not what
[1:04:50] it's not how you view yourself forget
[1:04:52] that if you do that the devil's got you
[1:04:54] on a distraction and there would have
[1:04:56] been a lot of this is just me there
[1:04:57] would have been a few distractions on
[1:04:59] the way
[1:05:00] because the path they took was like
[1:05:02] state highway one
[1:05:04] there would have been other people you
[1:05:05] know some one my little mind is there's
[1:05:08] there's abraham and his people all by
[1:05:09] himself and eliezer just journeys
[1:05:12] through a wilderness and there's no one
[1:05:13] around
[1:05:14] then it comes to rebecca and there's
[1:05:16] laban a few other people then he goes
[1:05:17] back that there would have been other
[1:05:18] people traveling
[1:05:21] it was a trade route
[1:05:22] apparently it was the same same same
[1:05:25] journey that israel took when the
[1:05:26] babylonians took them into captivity
[1:05:28] they took them the same way
[1:05:30] so there would have been other men
[1:05:33] on the on the journey if you give me
[1:05:35] this liberty there would have been there
[1:05:37] would have been other people on the
[1:05:38] journey and maybe because because
[1:05:40] rebecca doesn't really know where she's
[1:05:41] going she's never been to the holy land
[1:05:44] she's never yeah and and i'm assuming
[1:05:46] that the geography and things are
[1:05:47] slightly different from iraq to there
[1:05:50] and so maybe they were getting close she
[1:05:52] began to ask the question who's that man
[1:05:55] who's that person
[1:05:57] and you know because eliezer
[1:05:59] he's a faithful servant
[1:06:01] the word that he sent
[1:06:04] is faithful
[1:06:06] and keeps us on track
[1:06:08] so maybe liaise is there rebecca's
[1:06:09] either going on the camel and she looks
[1:06:11] she sees a man over there says who's
[1:06:13] that man
[1:06:14] and ella and elias would say no that's
[1:06:16] just communism that's just socialism
[1:06:19] don't get off your camel to meet that
[1:06:21] that's not the right one
[1:06:23] amen oh then what's that one oh that's
[1:06:26] just politics
[1:06:27] don't get off and meet him
[1:06:29] stay on the camel
[1:06:31] stay on the camel i mean don't get off
[1:06:33] the camel rebecca that's not the one
[1:06:34] you're called to marry stay right on the
[1:06:37] camel
[1:06:38] amen well what is the other one oh
[1:06:40] there's gender identity don't get off
[1:06:42] that one don't get off and visit that
[1:06:44] one
[1:06:45] whatever is trending would have been a
[1:06:46] distraction
[1:06:48] but if she listened to eliezer which she
[1:06:50] did she got to isaac right but if she
[1:06:53] didn't listen to him and thought well
[1:06:54] that must be the one where she would
[1:06:56] have got off the camel and her journey
[1:06:57] would have stopped right there
[1:06:59] so don't get caught up with what's
[1:07:01] trending i mean be caught up in the word
[1:07:04] be caught up with the lord jesus christ
[1:07:06] hallelujah
[1:07:08] amen you know people get so
[1:07:11] worried about stuff
[1:07:13] it has to be here it's the even time
[1:07:15] what's that one that's pestilence and
[1:07:17] fear don't get caught up on that one
[1:07:18] rebecca look sure it's there but you
[1:07:20] know don't be distracted just stay on
[1:07:22] the camel
[1:07:23] what about that one there
[1:07:25] and now they say yeah you should keep an
[1:07:27] eye on that one because he looks so much
[1:07:29] like isaac but he's not it's that
[1:07:31] religious spirit that form of godless
[1:07:33] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:07:35] turn away look so close that religious
[1:07:38] spirit that tries to come and make us
[1:07:39] formal lukewarm powerless you know that
[1:07:41] one of the definitions of lukewarm just
[1:07:43] in the webster is lacks conviction
[1:07:45] and you can be very on fire for the
[1:07:47] wrong thing
[1:07:49] right you can be people are on fire you
[1:07:51] look at what's going on in the world
[1:07:53] some people are on fire for a lot of
[1:07:54] things but when it comes to the lord to
[1:07:56] his word they're lukewarm why because
[1:07:59] they're on fire for something else
[1:08:01] so elias would say to rebecca yeah you
[1:08:03] watch him because the prophet remember
[1:08:05] aleiza told us watch the purple curtain
[1:08:07] he says about communism when it's on its
[1:08:09] height and there's a fever pitch of
[1:08:11] nuclear war he actually says communism
[1:08:13] is not even a pebble on the beach
[1:08:15] everyone's crying about communism he
[1:08:17] said all the preachers and all this
[1:08:18] stuff and it's not even a pebble on the
[1:08:20] beach
[1:08:21] and on that and and in that day
[1:08:24] that there was a cuban missile crisis
[1:08:26] all there was you know they used to have
[1:08:28] i think it was in berlin where there was
[1:08:30] the you know the berlin wall there'd be
[1:08:32] different checkpoints and there'd be
[1:08:34] soviet tanks and and american tanks
[1:08:37] lining up on either side
[1:08:39] just standing there ready to go point
[1:08:41] blank
[1:08:42] there's a lot of stuff going on in the
[1:08:44] world he says don't worry about it
[1:08:47] that's just a tool in abraham's hand
[1:08:49] elias you would say it's just a tool
[1:08:51] everything's work don't worry about that
[1:08:53] have your focus on meeting isaac
[1:08:56] i will point him out to you when we get
[1:08:58] there
[1:09:00] hallelujah
[1:09:01] you know it's like brother donnie reagan
[1:09:02] said about um lions in africa where you
[1:09:04] know if you listen to those services
[1:09:06] which if you feel the blues just go
[1:09:08] watch them
[1:09:09] hallelujah
[1:09:11] yeah he said about lions in africa i
[1:09:12] think he's up in kenya or something and
[1:09:14] he you know they're on safari and
[1:09:15] there's a lioness sitting on a uh ant
[1:09:18] mound and there's all the gazelles and
[1:09:19] stuff around and things and you know but
[1:09:21] there's this there's this line sitting
[1:09:23] up here
[1:09:24] and
[1:09:25] and and said brother donnie yeah what's
[1:09:27] this line doing what's going on and you
[1:09:29] know the guy said oh no hold on hold on
[1:09:31] i'll look around for other lions because
[1:09:33] he said that's just the distraction
[1:09:35] it's the ones that are creeping in the
[1:09:37] tall grass you don't need a lot of grass
[1:09:39] to hide a lion we found out when we're
[1:09:41] in the kruger you know you don't need a
[1:09:42] lot of grass it can be this big in the
[1:09:44] iguana you know it's the ones that you
[1:09:46] can't see the ones that are going to
[1:09:47] devour
[1:09:48] it's not the distractions that's why
[1:09:51] don't worry about what's trending in the
[1:09:53] world today
[1:09:55] that's just a distraction
[1:09:57] it will make you get off your camel
[1:09:59] right and be eaten we want to stay with
[1:10:03] the word we want to walk with him
[1:10:06] sure these things are here we should be
[1:10:07] aware of them but it's just a
[1:10:09] distraction
[1:10:12] hallelujah
[1:10:14] amen now where are we i'm not sure where
[1:10:16] we are here we are now so he says what
[1:10:17] kind of effect so so rebecca
[1:10:21] was introduced
[1:10:23] to
[1:10:24] oh before i go there
[1:10:26] you know
[1:10:27] abraham told eliezer the angel of the
[1:10:29] lord will go before you
[1:10:32] so it wasn't even so
[1:10:34] so
[1:10:35] the angel of the lord prepared rebecca's
[1:10:37] heart
[1:10:38] to say i'll go
[1:10:40] before eliezer ever got there god was
[1:10:42] working as the same thing with you and i
[1:10:45] trust this is real personal there
[1:10:47] shouldn't just be some concept you
[1:10:48] should be able to see yourself by god's
[1:10:50] grace in the scripture saying actually
[1:10:53] she's she's living me out
[1:10:56] maybe just even in a condensed form but
[1:10:57] this is my life this is the story of my
[1:11:00] life where before i even heard the
[1:11:02] message god was stirring me up there's
[1:11:04] more to life than this i gotta what's
[1:11:06] going on and why is it this way why am i
[1:11:08] feeling this way why is everyone else
[1:11:10] seems unconcerned but i'm concerned
[1:11:12] about my soul what is it the angel lord
[1:11:14] begins to steal with you hallelujah and
[1:11:16] then the message comes your way
[1:11:18] and and she didn't even realize at the
[1:11:21] time because elias didn't say to her
[1:11:22] when she first when they first met the
[1:11:24] angel lord has come to prepare you to be
[1:11:26] a bride
[1:11:27] no he just begins to explain about the
[1:11:29] camels and gives her gifts and different
[1:11:30] things he actually testifies to laban to
[1:11:33] the denominational brethren saying
[1:11:35] actually the angel lord amen came before
[1:11:38] me
[1:11:39] hallelujah and all this has happened
[1:11:41] and then rebecca's by standing saying
[1:11:43] god moved on me
[1:11:45] this is why i've said yes this is why
[1:11:46] i'm stirred up
[1:11:48] hallelujah god stirred me up
[1:11:50] god made me respond
[1:11:52] it was god anointing me to say yes to
[1:11:54] his word
[1:11:55] hallelujah
[1:11:57] you know what i love is that you know
[1:11:59] that same angel of god we know
[1:12:03] i'm glad someone agrees
[1:12:05] the same angel of the lord we know we
[1:12:09] don't know a different god we don't know
[1:12:11] we don't know a lesser god but the very
[1:12:13] same one that that spoke to rebecca
[1:12:16] hallelujah the same one we've met you
[1:12:18] know i was listening to brother dwayne
[1:12:19] lawson he was preaching on the dynamics
[1:12:21] are here and and he was telling a story
[1:12:24] he was talking about daniel and the
[1:12:25] lion's den he said when daniel was
[1:12:27] thrown into the lion's den or the dean
[1:12:29] of lions i mean he said he felt the
[1:12:31] anointing come down
[1:12:33] hallelujah and then of course that made
[1:12:36] the lions be tame as little kittens and
[1:12:38] he said that daniel had a real good
[1:12:40] night real good night's sleep that night
[1:12:42] now i begin to rejoice because i begin
[1:12:43] to realize i know someone
[1:12:46] amen who's been in the lion's den who's
[1:12:49] had exactly the same effect where
[1:12:51] physically they should have been
[1:12:52] murdered i remember then god stepped
[1:12:54] down and intervened and actually took
[1:12:57] the enemy under subjection and they
[1:12:59] walked out free now you may be asking
[1:13:01] well who is that person was she's just
[1:13:03] through those doors there i mean where
[1:13:05] christine was was you know when she was
[1:13:08] younger about 20 the sisters in church
[1:13:10] up in town were trimming their hair some
[1:13:12] of them and she was feeling tempted to
[1:13:13] do the same she was struggling with some
[1:13:15] things but then she had a dream where
[1:13:17] she had some scissors in her hand and
[1:13:19] angels were standing around her and she
[1:13:21] was and she was about to cut her hair
[1:13:23] but the angels were crying out don't do
[1:13:25] it because if you do it we can't protect
[1:13:27] you and then one of the angels took the
[1:13:29] scripture and opened it up to first
[1:13:32] corinthians 11 he said for this cause a
[1:13:35] woman ought to have uncut here along
[1:13:37] here because of the angels
[1:13:39] and then she had a dream shortly after
[1:13:41] this of she was working in her father's
[1:13:43] knife shop now if anyone ever went to
[1:13:44] that shop you know there's only one way
[1:13:46] in and out that's the front door
[1:13:48] if you're behind the counter you can't
[1:13:50] hide
[1:13:50] because the back walls literally right
[1:13:52] here here's the counter here and she had
[1:13:54] a dream that a crazy man came in with a
[1:13:56] knife and was gonna try and kill her but
[1:13:59] but the man couldn't touch her because
[1:14:01] the lord came down and protected her and
[1:14:04] then it was a shortly time after this it
[1:14:06] was a public holiday and and every other
[1:14:09] shop had closed but you know
[1:14:11] albert being albert made to keep the
[1:14:12] shop open it's very quiet there in the
[1:14:14] arcade who's been in that arcade it's
[1:14:16] not on the street front it's a very
[1:14:17] quiet spot you imagine a public holiday
[1:14:20] no one's going to be in there they'll be
[1:14:21] at the beach or something outside you
[1:14:22] know so but then the man in a dream came
[1:14:25] in frothing at the mouth like a rabid
[1:14:27] dog so i'm gonna kill you started
[1:14:29] swearing and cursing and everything but
[1:14:30] and she was behind the counter she
[1:14:32] realized that she couldn't escape
[1:14:34] because he was you know he could easily
[1:14:35] reach over and stab her but then when he
[1:14:37] came and did these things she said she
[1:14:39] felt the presence of god come stand down
[1:14:41] i'm in between her and the man and then
[1:14:44] he just kind of froze and was shocked
[1:14:45] and then he ran out the building
[1:14:47] and then he came back a few minutes
[1:14:49] later all sober-minded looking sober and
[1:14:51] said sorry about that lady
[1:14:53] what happened that's the same angel that
[1:14:54] was with daniel amen
[1:14:57] with was with one of us
[1:14:58] we have a living testimony amen the same
[1:15:01] god amen will protect you if you take
[1:15:03] god at his word it's all about our
[1:15:06] attitude towards the word it's not that
[1:15:07] thou shalt thou shall not know god has
[1:15:10] put protection in his word
[1:15:12] i mean we've got to have the right
[1:15:13] attitude towards it i mean then a few
[1:15:15] years after that she was walking from
[1:15:17] work that that's why i said she's been
[1:15:19] in the lion's den twice
[1:15:20] she is walking i know you know these
[1:15:22] testimonies but i think it's good to
[1:15:23] tell them again you know because that
[1:15:25] same angel we know he's not an idea he's
[1:15:28] not a theory he's not history amen but
[1:15:30] we can go step back in the scripture
[1:15:32] because we can see our lives in the
[1:15:33] scripture hallelujah and then so she's
[1:15:36] walking from from work and she's going
[1:15:38] back home in this long a park area there
[1:15:40] by the motorway there in taranga and
[1:15:43] there's a man standing on the path in
[1:15:44] front of her there's this bushes and
[1:15:46] there he is he's got a dog on a lead and
[1:15:48] he's just standing in the middle of the
[1:15:49] path and she just decides well i can't
[1:15:52] act scared and you know turn around and
[1:15:53] go back so she decides to keep walking
[1:15:55] and when she gets up to where the man is
[1:15:57] three other men jump out of the bushes
[1:16:00] they are not they don't have looks on
[1:16:02] their faces like they're saying hello
[1:16:03] how are you
[1:16:04] they have murderous intent
[1:16:07] in them
[1:16:09] and then then so so she was surrounded
[1:16:12] but then she and and she even thought
[1:16:13] this is a bad situation to be in
[1:16:16] but then a revelation struck her because
[1:16:18] she felt the anointing come down again
[1:16:20] i mean they can't touch me because my
[1:16:22] uncut hair my vow with god and the angel
[1:16:24] of the god stepped down just like he did
[1:16:27] in the shop
[1:16:28] they all froze including the dog
[1:16:30] and she actually pushed the dog aside
[1:16:32] aiming to keep walking on
[1:16:34] hallelujah but then when she got outside
[1:16:36] of those those men and that dog she
[1:16:38] started running because she began to
[1:16:39] realize actually what god got rid of
[1:16:42] hallelujah see it's not us trying to say
[1:16:44] i'm going to fight the devil i'm going
[1:16:46] to deal with him no when the devil comes
[1:16:48] along i mean god steps on the scene
[1:16:51] because remember it's not us trying to
[1:16:53] fight it's god will come down and fight
[1:16:55] our battles
[1:16:56] hallelujah
[1:16:57] amen hallelujah so i was real happy
[1:17:00] driving in the car thing i know someone
[1:17:01] like daniel in the lion's den
[1:17:03] hallelujah he's all about god
[1:17:08] hallelujah
[1:17:10] a
[1:17:11] man
[1:17:12] you know brother brown tells a testimony
[1:17:15] when when his little rebecca was real
[1:17:17] young between about two or three years
[1:17:18] old and she'd just be screaming all the
[1:17:20] time and you know they'd be in a
[1:17:22] restaurant one of them would eat say
[1:17:23] sister mita would eat and brother brown
[1:17:25] would walk around outside because she'd
[1:17:26] just scream and scream all the time i
[1:17:28] don't know how long this went for but
[1:17:30] then one day he was driving along with
[1:17:32] her and the lord spoke to him saying
[1:17:33] this is the devil trying to get at your
[1:17:35] ministry
[1:17:36] and then so
[1:17:37] well there's actually a photo um i don't
[1:17:39] have it on me but actually in the field
[1:17:41] because he's driving on this
[1:17:43] there's a middle field there with your
[1:17:44] flowers and stuff
[1:17:46] and the lord tells him this he stops the
[1:17:47] car gets rebecca out prays for her and
[1:17:49] she turns to a sweet normal happy little
[1:17:51] girl
[1:17:52] and so now a few years ago now what i
[1:17:55] rejoice is the same god the prophet
[1:17:57] knows we know
[1:17:59] right and if the devil came against the
[1:18:01] prophet that way we've got to be sure
[1:18:03] he'll come against us that way but if we
[1:18:05] know the same god the prophet knows amen
[1:18:07] the devil will will be losing again
[1:18:10] hallelujah so now when our little gabes
[1:18:12] was real little like that date she would
[1:18:14] start screaming and shouting and just
[1:18:15] writhing on the ground you just couldn't
[1:18:17] do anything for her
[1:18:18] and then and then this was going on for
[1:18:20] quite a while and then one saturday
[1:18:22] night i'm preparing here and christine
[1:18:24] calls me because this is going on and
[1:18:25] i'm running home and that testimony of
[1:18:27] brother brown about rebecca came to my
[1:18:30] mind and the lord said this is the devil
[1:18:32] trying to get at your ministry so i went
[1:18:34] in
[1:18:35] and i pray
[1:18:36] she's in the hallway right by our
[1:18:37] kitchen writhing and shouting and
[1:18:39] screaming unconsolable we prayed for
[1:18:41] laid hands and prayed for rebuke that
[1:18:43] devil in the name of jesus christ and
[1:18:45] she turned into a calm little swingle
[1:18:46] that she is today
[1:18:48] hallelujah
[1:18:50] and then i promptly i probably came back
[1:18:53] here but then now christine's at home of
[1:18:55] course the girls are asleep and she's
[1:18:56] playing the piano and she felt like
[1:18:58] there was someone standing looking over
[1:19:00] her shoulder
[1:19:02] because that spirit was actually still
[1:19:04] in the house
[1:19:05] and then she went into the bathroom and
[1:19:08] the bathroom tap it was like someone
[1:19:10] turned it on fully on them fully off and
[1:19:13] she was anywhere near it and she
[1:19:15] realized actually that spirit is still
[1:19:16] in the house so she opened the window
[1:19:18] and she commanded it to leave in the
[1:19:20] name of jesus christ hallelujah we have
[1:19:22] the most peaceful bathroom in the world
[1:19:26] all the peaceful house in the world
[1:19:28] and the reason she did that is because
[1:19:30] when she was a little baby the devil
[1:19:32] tried to kill her in her cot
[1:19:34] and her parents realized they're on a
[1:19:35] rented flat they realized there was an
[1:19:37] evil spirit in that place
[1:19:39] and they prayed and then that that that
[1:19:42] devil was cast out of the christine as a
[1:19:44] baby but it was still lingering in the
[1:19:45] flats they opened the window they prayed
[1:19:47] again and the thing was cast out
[1:19:50] amen but we but we're going to realize
[1:19:53] the same devil that the prophet fought
[1:19:55] or the believers fought we fight
[1:19:58] but the same god that was on their side
[1:20:00] is on our side we don't have a lesser
[1:20:02] god you know the angel of the lord did
[1:20:04] not leave when the prophet left in 65 no
[1:20:07] that same angel is on the earth
[1:20:08] preparing a bride amen for isaac
[1:20:12] hallelujah
[1:20:14] amen and then we can go yo we were
[1:20:16] having family prayer talking about these
[1:20:18] things then christine said you know we
[1:20:20] have we have naaman's little israelite
[1:20:22] servant girl in the family too
[1:20:24] i've been gonna think a while i said
[1:20:26] yeah that's right remember the remember
[1:20:28] neyman had an israelite servant girl
[1:20:30] remember the bible should come alive
[1:20:33] we're living in the pages of the
[1:20:34] scripture this is not history
[1:20:37] this is not the the same life actually i
[1:20:39] was tempted today to preach on family
[1:20:41] traits maybe it'll be another take but
[1:20:43] you should be able to see family traits
[1:20:44] of the believers in the scripture
[1:20:46] usually those same traits and you and i
[1:20:49] of rugged faith overcoming faith
[1:20:51] hallelujah and so now so yeah yes a name
[1:20:54] and servant girl you know she said oh i
[1:20:56] wish you know naaman because he had
[1:20:58] leprosy you know that he would go and yo
[1:21:01] yo because there's a prophet in israel
[1:21:03] that can heal them
[1:21:04] and then so now we have a little lily
[1:21:06] about two or three hallelujah amen we're
[1:21:09] up from you know brother our monster
[1:21:10] chantal's house his mum had is going to
[1:21:13] get baptized and corbus's dad has said
[1:21:15] no i'm not going to get baptized very
[1:21:17] you know i wouldn't even raise his hands
[1:21:18] in church very religious kind of man but
[1:21:20] very strict or whatever you could define
[1:21:22] it as and then you know i'm there i'm
[1:21:24] reading romans 6. that's why i love to
[1:21:26] read this because there's power in god's
[1:21:28] word
[1:21:29] now
[1:21:30] all this time god was dealing with him
[1:21:32] because you know he was so getting so
[1:21:34] agitated because he because people would
[1:21:36] testify to him god spoke to me
[1:21:38] i talked to god he spoke to me
[1:21:40] he showed me this and he's getting so
[1:21:42] mad saying where's that phone i can pick
[1:21:44] up and call god i want god to speak to
[1:21:46] me
[1:21:47] but see he had this religious kind of
[1:21:49] covering but he had sin like naaman had
[1:21:51] armor
[1:21:52] but he had sin in his life had that
[1:21:54] leprosy tried to keep it hidden because
[1:21:56] once you're outed as a leper you're
[1:21:57] outcast and so there he was he had this
[1:22:00] religious armor on but he had leprosy of
[1:22:02] sin in his life corbuster and then so
[1:22:04] i'm reading romans 6 we were going
[1:22:06] having a baptism there going to baptise
[1:22:07] header and um you know in their bathtub
[1:22:10] and then
[1:22:12] corbus before this said i'm not getting
[1:22:13] baptized tonight the next morning
[1:22:15] they're about to fly to south africa
[1:22:17] three in the morning had to get up and
[1:22:18] take them or something silly you know
[1:22:19] the silly hours you know and so this is
[1:22:22] at 11 at night or something and they
[1:22:24] said they're they're here saying i'm not
[1:22:26] going to get baptized i'm reading the
[1:22:27] scripture and i'm standing there like
[1:22:29] this and then out of the corner of my
[1:22:31] eyes i'm reading i see lilia who was yay
[1:22:33] big and she would and she came along and
[1:22:35] i just saw her go like this at the court
[1:22:37] pointing up at the bible
[1:22:38] and then so during this time
[1:22:41] corbus wanted her to come sit with her i
[1:22:43] mean sit with him but she wouldn't she
[1:22:45] ran over pointed up at the scripture as
[1:22:47] i was reading it and then walked along
[1:22:48] got a little like toy like zorro mask
[1:22:51] and gave it to him
[1:22:52] and then he broke down crying because
[1:22:55] the lord spoke spoke to him saying
[1:22:57] listen to the word take off your
[1:22:59] religious mask that's why we gotta don't
[1:23:01] wear a mask
[1:23:03] this is not a masquerade party we're
[1:23:05] going to be real god wants real people
[1:23:07] who are real with him not trying to put
[1:23:09] up a front and all this and this and
[1:23:11] this no just be real if you need god say
[1:23:13] god i need you if you need help he's
[1:23:15] here to help this is not a place to
[1:23:17] condemn this is not a place of
[1:23:18] condemnation this is a house of liberty
[1:23:21] there's a house of praise there's a
[1:23:22] house of worship this is a house of
[1:23:24] deliverance
[1:23:25] amen so so he just broke down crying
[1:23:27] saying you know
[1:23:29] through this little girl
[1:23:32] name and servant name and servant girl
[1:23:35] because she delivered a message and when
[1:23:37] he obeyed that message he was washed
[1:23:40] hallelujah and so she and then so he
[1:23:42] broke down saying you know
[1:23:44] i you know i didn't want to get baptized
[1:23:45] but the lord spoke to me through this
[1:23:46] little girl through lilia
[1:23:48] said listen to the word take off your
[1:23:50] religious mask and do what the word said
[1:23:52] and so after we baptized header we
[1:23:53] baptized corpus and when he came out of
[1:23:55] the water he had his hands raised to the
[1:23:57] lord totally different man
[1:24:00] hallelujah
[1:24:02] hallelujah
[1:24:04] so you know we should be in the bible
[1:24:06] you know then then analysts say well
[1:24:07] what about me
[1:24:09] hallelujah and then well we said well
[1:24:11] you know you've had a thus saith the
[1:24:12] lord personally to you
[1:24:14] i said the lord i know what you think
[1:24:16] about when you lay down on your bed at
[1:24:18] night i am calling you
[1:24:20] i mean just come to me and i'll fill you
[1:24:22] with the holy ghost because she was
[1:24:25] she'd lay down on her bed saying i
[1:24:26] wonder is it god calling me or is it
[1:24:28] just me and is it just family and you
[1:24:30] know because it's what we do and god
[1:24:32] answered saying no no i'm calling you
[1:24:34] this is not your thought saying should i
[1:24:36] or shouldn't i no no this is god calling
[1:24:38] in the scripture those things are uh
[1:24:40] whole chapters
[1:24:41] where god people would seek and you know
[1:24:43] seek god god would come down and to give
[1:24:45] an answer to me thus saith the lord
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:49] we're all in the bible we should all be
[1:24:51] in the bible
[1:24:52] amen why because we know the same angel
[1:24:54] of the lord he's not a different god
[1:24:56] he's the same god and the same angel of
[1:24:59] the lord that spoke to rebecca's heart
[1:25:01] she said i will go has moved on our
[1:25:03] lives
[1:25:05] amen and we have said we will go
[1:25:08] and here we are
[1:25:09] we're on our
[1:25:10] journey we are on
[1:25:14] our journey
[1:25:16] hallelujah
[1:25:18] amen now
[1:25:20] we gotta not get off our camel
[1:25:23] now the camel in the scripture a beast
[1:25:26] in the bible represents a power
[1:25:29] and so those camels that that that
[1:25:31] rebecca was watering were going to carry
[1:25:33] her to her isaac
[1:25:35] and brother brahm says in enticing
[1:25:37] spirits i believe it is here he says and
[1:25:39] rebecca had to make the choice because
[1:25:41] he said
[1:25:42] she is the maid let her make the choice
[1:25:44] laban said pardoning
[1:25:46] and as soon it was was made to her
[1:25:48] quickly her mind was made up she said
[1:25:50] i'll go and she mounted upon the camel
[1:25:52] and went to meet look the very camel she
[1:25:55] watered was a camel that packed her to
[1:25:57] her bridegroom and all of her success
[1:26:02] who wants success on the way
[1:26:06] so it's not just to our bridegroom but
[1:26:08] it's to all of her success
[1:26:11] and the very camel the very power i mean
[1:26:13] the beast in the bible represents a
[1:26:15] power and the very power that we give
[1:26:17] water and praise to amen water life
[1:26:20] praise to the word is the very thing
[1:26:22] that packs us into the glory land to
[1:26:25] meet the bridegroom yes sir so the same
[1:26:27] word the same holy ghost we water with
[1:26:29] praise and thanksgiving it's the same
[1:26:32] power that's going to change these atoms
[1:26:34] of this body
[1:26:35] take us to that next dimension that's
[1:26:37] why we should be very very adamant let
[1:26:40] nothing take your praise from you let
[1:26:42] nothing rob you of your praise to god
[1:26:44] amen let nothing diminish it let nothing
[1:26:47] dilute it let nothing rob you of it amen
[1:26:50] but you should be praising god from a
[1:26:52] from a thankful heart i mean what you're
[1:26:54] watering the same power that's going to
[1:26:55] take you out of the world
[1:26:57] hallelujah
[1:26:59] amen amen why is it psalm see don't let
[1:27:02] nothing steal your praise you know some
[1:27:05] people think that people don't deserve
[1:27:07] to praise and shout and you know cry in
[1:27:09] god's presence because they haven't been
[1:27:11] through enough hardship to me that's
[1:27:13] nonsense no we've been through enough
[1:27:16] i've been justified that's enough
[1:27:18] i never did it in the first place his
[1:27:20] blood has cleansed me
[1:27:22] i stand in his in his presence undefiled
[1:27:25] without sin
[1:27:26] that's something to praise god about
[1:27:28] hallelujah and i've been sanctified he's
[1:27:30] taken all the worldly desires out of my
[1:27:32] life he cleans my life that's something
[1:27:34] to praise god about
[1:27:36] hallelujah amen and not only that but
[1:27:39] i've been filled with his goodness
[1:27:40] filled with the spirit i mean the very
[1:27:42] lord of glory dwells in me
[1:27:44] hallelujah that's something to praise
[1:27:46] him for thank you god you called me
[1:27:48] thank you god you washed me i mean thank
[1:27:50] you god you filled me with your spirit
[1:27:53] hallelujah
[1:27:54] amen so let nothing let nothing rob you
[1:27:57] of your praise
[1:27:59] hallelujah
[1:28:00] sure there's testimonies along the way
[1:28:02] and we just thank thank the lord more
[1:28:04] for them
[1:28:05] but if you've got nothing you think
[1:28:06] about praising god about just thinking
[1:28:08] where he found you
[1:28:10] he saved you for a reason he saved you
[1:28:12] for a purpose he didn't just call you
[1:28:14] just to just to see if he could do it no
[1:28:17] or just because
[1:28:19] he
[1:28:20] saved you
[1:28:21] for a purpose
[1:28:22] he saved you because he loved you
[1:28:25] hallelujah
[1:28:27] heaven has a spot for you
[1:28:29] he wants you there that's why this
[1:28:31] message has gone forth and we're going
[1:28:33] to respond to it that it can take us up
[1:28:35] into glory so let nothing rob you of
[1:28:37] your praise i think in the end time
[1:28:39] there should be more praise when we see
[1:28:41] the headstone coming down i mean that
[1:28:43] he's the holy ghost himself uniting
[1:28:46] himself with a people
[1:28:48] what that's crying grace grace unto it
[1:28:51] that means when we see the lord becoming
[1:28:52] one with us
[1:28:54] what should be our response grace
[1:28:56] grace what is grace magnified oh what
[1:28:59] graciousness has come upon me what
[1:29:01] divine influence has come upon my life
[1:29:03] just like it became upon rebecca's life
[1:29:06] i mean what kind of divine influence is
[1:29:08] this oh what man is this that's walking
[1:29:09] out to meet me in the field
[1:29:11] hallelujah
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:14] amen but the devil wants to shut us up
[1:29:16] but we'll say no devil this is the time
[1:29:18] for the bride to speak
[1:29:20] you've been accusing for long enough but
[1:29:22] now there's going to be a response
[1:29:25] hallelujah now it's going to be it's but
[1:29:27] it's going to be through your lips
[1:29:29] you've got to tell the accuser where to
[1:29:30] go get back to out of darkness from
[1:29:32] where you belong go back into chains of
[1:29:34] torment down into hell where you belong
[1:29:37] that place was created for you and your
[1:29:39] angels get back where you belong
[1:29:41] in the name of jesus christ
[1:29:43] hallelujah
[1:29:44] amen the accuser of the brethren he's
[1:29:47] going to make his last accusation one
[1:29:49] day
[1:29:50] but every every voice that raises itself
[1:29:53] up in judgment against you thou shalt
[1:29:55] condemn that's from isaiah says no
[1:29:57] weapon formed against he shall prosper
[1:29:59] there'll be a lot of weapons formed
[1:30:00] against you but they won't prosper when
[1:30:02] you begin to realize what is this thing
[1:30:04] i'm talking with
[1:30:05] that makes me feel useless and not loved
[1:30:07] and not appreciated not wanted not part
[1:30:09] of the body of christ not an overcomer
[1:30:11] what is this thing it's the accuser it's
[1:30:14] not your own self it's the accuser and
[1:30:16] you've got you've got to tell to shut up
[1:30:18] in the name of jesus christ because he's
[1:30:20] the one that's condemned you know what i
[1:30:22] love about this
[1:30:23] in the old testament under the blood of
[1:30:25] bulls and goats is all the believers
[1:30:27] failures
[1:30:29] hallelujah but in the new testament
[1:30:32] there are none of the believer's
[1:30:34] failures it's just by faith through
[1:30:36] faith by faith hallelujah when paul
[1:30:39] wrote the divine commentary of abraham's
[1:30:41] life you've got to think about this
[1:30:43] he would have known the five books he
[1:30:45] would have known the old testament by
[1:30:46] heart right but then he's inspired to
[1:30:50] write the divine commentary of abraham's
[1:30:52] life and he would say he staggered not
[1:30:55] at the promise of god but was strong
[1:30:57] giving praise to god being fully
[1:30:58] persuaded he is able to perform that
[1:31:00] which he has promised
[1:31:01] now that was god writing that about
[1:31:03] abraham that wasn't paul writing it
[1:31:04] about abraham
[1:31:06] but but the reason is because through
[1:31:08] the blood of jesus christ now it's
[1:31:10] actually it's not the acts of their
[1:31:12] failures that are recorded it's their
[1:31:14] victories of who they are because they
[1:31:16] believed
[1:31:18] and their faith was manifested in their
[1:31:19] lives but you know what i love in the
[1:31:21] old testament the sins of the devil are
[1:31:23] still recorded
[1:31:25] iniquity was found in me
[1:31:27] isaiah says you'll be brought down to
[1:31:29] the pit
[1:31:30] and in the new testament his sins are
[1:31:32] still recorded
[1:31:34] hallelujah because the blood wasn't for
[1:31:36] him he can't be redeemed
[1:31:38] hallelujah so you've got to take the
[1:31:40] book and say a devil
[1:31:42] hold on
[1:31:44] um
[1:31:45] this word's true you know it's true
[1:31:47] that's why you fight it that's why you
[1:31:48] try and tell me it's not true you know
[1:31:49] it's true
[1:31:50] uh ezekiel would record your life and
[1:31:53] say this and isaiah would say this
[1:31:56] and then uh have you read the end of the
[1:31:58] book
[1:32:00] not the maps in gloucester i'm talking
[1:32:01] about the book of revelation have you
[1:32:03] read that um you burn in the lake of
[1:32:05] fire
[1:32:06] that's where you get off
[1:32:08] and this is where i continue on
[1:32:10] and you can say devil devil this has all
[1:32:12] been just no we know it's not
[1:32:14] chronological but just bear with me just
[1:32:15] an illustration
[1:32:17] uh devil this part's all been fulfilled

[1:32:32] of jerusalem you couldn't stop the
[1:32:34] temple being rebuilt you couldn't stop
[1:32:35] the walls being rebuilt you couldn't
[1:32:37] stop john the baptist coming you
[1:32:39] couldn't stop jesus coming you couldn't
[1:32:41] stop the apostles i mean you couldn't
[1:32:42] stop the church ages you couldn't stop
[1:32:44] it and satan you won't stop it now
[1:32:47] because you couldn't stop it then
[1:32:50] hallelujah

[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:55] hallelujah

[1:32:59] fight it but you've got to make up your
[1:33:00] mind now i'm following this word

[1:33:07] to empty promises no it will lead me to
[1:33:10] where my joys be full
[1:33:11] i'm not talking about just at the end of
[1:33:13] the road this is on the road

[1:37:39] it's all gone all cleansed now
[1:37:41] hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:37:43] amen
[1:37:46] now
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:51] so we're living in this time and
[1:37:54] where time and eternity are blending
[1:37:56] together
[1:37:58] we're in reality and i don't even think
[1:38:00] i've really touched what i'm
[1:38:01] wanting to get it but
[1:38:03] there is now this time
[1:38:05] brother abraham says that he may not do
[1:38:07] it but this message will introduce jesus
[1:38:10] christ to the world
[1:38:12] right and i'm sure that is your
[1:38:14] testimony you heard this word maybe
[1:38:16] you're in church maybe you were just out
[1:38:18] in the world wherever you were
[1:38:20] but then you heard this message what did
[1:38:22] it do it didn't introduce a prophet to
[1:38:24] you
[1:38:24] alias's mission wasn't to get rebecca to
[1:38:27] fall in love with her
[1:38:29] elias's mission was to get rebecca to
[1:38:31] fall in love with isaac right as the
[1:38:33] same thing with brother brown the
[1:38:35] biggest disservice you could ever do to
[1:38:37] the prophet's ministry is fall in love
[1:38:39] with the man william branham and be
[1:38:41] caught up in his personality in what he
[1:38:42] did that's the biggest disservice you
[1:38:44] could ever do to the prophet but the
[1:38:46] biggest compliment you could ever give
[1:38:48] him was fall in love with jesus christ
[1:38:50] the word because this message he said i
[1:38:52] shall not do it but this i may not do it
[1:38:54] but this message will introduce jesus
[1:38:56] christ to the world
[1:38:59] i'm i was part of the world that
[1:39:00] introduced the lord to me
[1:39:02] hallelujah
[1:39:04] amen so we're living in a time there's
[1:39:06] no more church ages after this the
[1:39:07] dispensation of the of grace for the
[1:39:09] gentiles is almost done
[1:39:11] amen because there's going to be a
[1:39:13] meeting in the air
[1:39:15] amen and we who are believers
[1:39:18] have been going on this journey from
[1:39:19] this world into glory as we have walked
[1:39:22] with our lord jesus and through the
[1:39:23] message the scriptures have come alive
[1:39:25] revealing to us who our lord jesus is
[1:39:27] his character and his nature what he
[1:39:29] loves and doesn't love and yet
[1:39:31] don't get me wrong we're united with
[1:39:33] christ now by the true baptism of the
[1:39:35] holy ghost but there is a literal jesus
[1:39:37] christ we're going to meet
[1:39:39] right there is a literal heaven we're
[1:39:40] going to go to brother braham says in
[1:39:42] three kinds of believers see don't
[1:39:43] spiritualize everything some people
[1:39:45] spiritualize the rapture already no no
[1:39:47] there's going to be a literal
[1:39:48] translation of our bodies there's going
[1:39:50] to be a literal raising of the dead in
[1:39:51] christ it's not going to be a thought
[1:39:54] it's going to be a reality where we're
[1:39:55] going to see our loved ones walk through
[1:39:57] the door they may be buried in africa
[1:39:59] they may be buried in some other part of
[1:40:01] the world but they'll step into this
[1:40:03] place because distance will be nothing
[1:40:04] to them and they'll walk through the
[1:40:06] door maybe you'll say hello young man
[1:40:08] young lady who are you but somehow
[1:40:10] you'll know them
[1:40:11] hallelujah they'll speak to you by name
[1:40:13] like jesus did to mary and you realize
[1:40:15] the resurrection's on
[1:40:17] hallelujah it's been going on for a
[1:40:19] while i mean we were once dead and sins
[1:40:21] and trespasses we've made alive in jesus
[1:40:23] christ remember there's got to be a
[1:40:24] resurrection from unbelief and death and
[1:40:26] sin
[1:40:27] enter the living word into lord jesus
[1:40:29] christ before this thing can be
[1:40:30] resurrected before the dead in christ
[1:40:31] can be resurrected
[1:40:34] that's the reason i do believe that when
[1:40:35] the bride is called out and elected
[1:40:36] brother braham says in three kind of
[1:40:38] believers and sit in the book of life
[1:40:40] that there will come a sound from heaven
[1:40:42] that will take that'll take such a
[1:40:43] baptism of the holy spirit into that
[1:40:45] bride that i'll take it from the earth
[1:40:47] in a rapturing grace god promised it
[1:40:49] don't care how many signs and how many
[1:40:51] astronauts they've signed up and
[1:40:53] everything else and how many million
[1:40:54] miles they can see i don't care nothing
[1:40:57] about there is a heaven
[1:40:58] and there's a literal jesus christ that
[1:41:00] will come in a body form to receive his
[1:41:03] church to himself no matter how old the
[1:41:06] story seems it's still the truth god
[1:41:08] said so that's what believers believe
[1:41:12] amen
[1:41:13] so if you're a believer today you
[1:41:14] believe you will see meet a literal lord
[1:41:16] jesus christ in the air
[1:41:18] hallelujah and there's a literal heaven
[1:41:20] he's going to take us to
[1:41:21] amen we are going to be met halfway
[1:41:25] hallelujah now he says in questions
[1:41:27] answers 1964. he says that remember
[1:41:30] isaac had left the tent was standing out
[1:41:31] in the field meditating in the late
[1:41:33] afternoon which is the evening amen amen
[1:41:36] when he saw rebecca coming and he never
[1:41:38] saw him and he never saw her but it was
[1:41:41] love at first sight she fell in love
[1:41:43] with him and he with her and she was
[1:41:45] even veiled amen oh my and look when she
[1:41:48] seen him her heart was so full of joy
[1:41:51] she didn't know who she was going to
[1:41:53] marry but by faith amen
[1:41:56] so because remember there came a time
[1:41:58] when everything eliezer told her
[1:42:00] became sight
[1:42:02] it wasn't just a story
[1:42:04] isaac's like this and he likes this and
[1:42:06] this is what he looks like this how he
[1:42:07] dresses is how he treats his servants
[1:42:09] and this is how he treats his dad and
[1:42:10] that you know no it went from just a
[1:42:13] word like that
[1:42:14] to became material
[1:42:17] now we know that in our lives christ is
[1:42:19] becoming material
[1:42:21] right but there came a time if i put it
[1:42:23] this way where it went from faith faith
[1:42:25] became sight
[1:42:27] because she heard about him but then she
[1:42:29] saw him
[1:42:30] amen and now this is what this is what
[1:42:32] faith has done to us we heard about
[1:42:35] jesus but now we begin to see him
[1:42:37] right by faith
[1:42:39] hallelujah now we know there'll be a
[1:42:40] time we'll meet him in the air but
[1:42:41] actually our faith i believe is becoming
[1:42:43] sight
[1:42:45] it becomes reality amen brother paul
[1:42:47] that's right amen so now
[1:42:50] and remember jesus will leave the
[1:42:52] kingdom will not meet him in glory where
[1:42:55] to meet him in the air between heavens
[1:42:57] and earth where it's expanded to redeem
[1:43:00] us and he met rebecca in the middle
[1:43:02] between her home and his home amen took
[1:43:05] her into his home and married her and
[1:43:06] fell air to everything his father had
[1:43:08] amen oh perfect just perfect all right
[1:43:10] but he's saying here that glory expanded
[1:43:13] now
[1:43:14] or glory has expanded to meet us
[1:43:18] hallelujah says now it's actually
[1:43:19] there's been an expansion of glory now
[1:43:22] down
[1:43:23] to meet us
[1:43:25] hallelujah because he met rebecca in the
[1:43:26] middle so now this is what's happened in
[1:43:28] this end time you say heaven has
[1:43:30] expanded down upon the earth now we know
[1:43:33] hell's empties itself out upon the earth
[1:43:35] but heaven has expanded itself also i
[1:43:38] mean so the prince of god has come down
[1:43:40] upon the earth i could this is just me
[1:43:42] in a greater way than ever has in the
[1:43:44] world
[1:43:45] amen why because god is going to take a
[1:43:47] people they'll walk with him and they
[1:43:49] shall be made in his very image what the
[1:43:51] ephesian age was aiming to become the
[1:43:53] very image of christ but they but they
[1:43:56] were anointed to aim at and relax and
[1:43:57] eventually the church would go down to a
[1:43:59] dark age brother man says we'll come to
[1:44:01] an ephesians again but in this age we're
[1:44:03] not just going to aim at aim at the the
[1:44:05] high calling in christ be made in his
[1:44:07] image we will become it there will be
[1:44:09] the cycle will be broken
[1:44:11] hallelujah so now heaven has expanded
[1:44:14] itself upon the earth to redeem us to
[1:44:16] gather us up
[1:44:17] so now in his presence now
[1:44:20] i'm just going to list these off and
[1:44:21] then maybe we'll stop
[1:44:23] in his presence
[1:44:25] is the fullness of joy you've got to
[1:44:27] think about who is this man who comes to
[1:44:28] meet us remember his presence goes
[1:44:30] before him
[1:44:31] hallelujah
[1:44:33] in his presence is the fullness of joy
[1:44:35] this is the one this is the mighty one
[1:44:37] who walks among us
[1:44:39] amen remember it wasn't it wasn't
[1:44:41] aliases charisma rebecca was caught up
[1:44:43] with it wasn't his personality it wasn't
[1:44:46] his argument it wasn't even his gifts it
[1:44:48] was actually the angel of the lord moved
[1:44:49] upon her heart to say i'll go
[1:44:52] amen but now in his presence is the
[1:44:54] fullness of joy
[1:44:56] his angel goes before us as he did the
[1:44:58] children of israel
[1:45:00] amen he encamps about those who fear him
[1:45:03] and he delivers them all
[1:45:05] the angel lord it doesn't say the angels
[1:45:06] of god it says the angel of the lord
[1:45:08] that's the prince of god himself and
[1:45:10] camps about those who fear him and he
[1:45:12] delivers them all
[1:45:14] in his presence sin has come to
[1:45:15] repentance
[1:45:17] in his presence the dead are raised man
[1:45:19] this glory has expanded heaven has
[1:45:21] expanded to redeem us
[1:45:22] in his presence the devil has to leave
[1:45:25] amen in his presence the yoke of the
[1:45:27] devil is broken because the anointing
[1:45:29] breaks the yoke in his presence as
[1:45:31] children find out who they truly are
[1:45:34] hallelujah in his presence his enemy is
[1:45:36] defeated amen in his presence the power
[1:45:39] of his blood is fully manifested i mean
[1:45:41] because the letter kills but the spirit
[1:45:43] giveth life i mean it's in his presence
[1:45:45] the power of his blood is fully
[1:45:46] manifested that's why when the spirit of
[1:45:48] god fell upon you the power of his blood
[1:45:50] became manifested because why you are
[1:45:52] loose from the bondage of sin and death
[1:45:55] became alive in jesus christ amen in his
[1:45:58] presence all those who want forgiveness
[1:46:00] can find it
[1:46:02] in his presence he commissions his
[1:46:04] children to fulfill what they're
[1:46:06] ordained to do
[1:46:07] amen be a housewife be a preacher be a
[1:46:10] deacon be a farmer be a businessman be
[1:46:12] whatever we all have you know brother
[1:46:14] man spoke about adoption and he actually
[1:46:16] said that a housewife that's a position
[1:46:18] that's an adopted position in the body
[1:46:20] of christ
[1:46:22] we think of prophets we think of
[1:46:23] fivefold ministry no he see the
[1:46:25] housewife in her position she's actually
[1:46:27] come to her adopted position in the body
[1:46:29] that's powerful amen when you realize
[1:46:31] you're actually in your god-given
[1:46:32] position amen david realized by the
[1:46:35] anointing of samuel he was king amen
[1:46:37] over israel and any enemy that came into
[1:46:39] his ground had to die and goliath was so
[1:46:42] you're the devil so stupid you know i
[1:46:44] was thinking about you know when
[1:46:45] christine said about the tap turning on
[1:46:47] in the bathroom
[1:46:48] you know the devil just can't help but
[1:46:50] reveal himself
[1:46:51] and when he reveals himself then he can
[1:46:53] be cast out but he just can't help it
[1:46:55] you know he's so trying to look in the
[1:46:57] shadows but he's just got to somehow
[1:46:58] just get busted
[1:47:00] you know so now goliath
[1:47:02] goliath where they were fighting there
[1:47:04] was king saul's army there's goliath and
[1:47:06] the philistines that was actually in
[1:47:08] judah
[1:47:10] david came out of judah
[1:47:12] that is david's inheritance as judah so
[1:47:14] here he is now he's been anointed king
[1:47:17] sure he's not on the throne yet but he
[1:47:18] is actually the king of israel david god
[1:47:21] said david's my king saul's not my king
[1:47:23] anymore but saul was still on the throne
[1:47:25] humanly but in god's mind david's king
[1:47:28] so now here comes the devil into david's
[1:47:31] inheritance
[1:47:32] into his adopted position
[1:47:34] and he thinks he can win
[1:47:37] bring me a man
[1:47:38] bring me a champion and here's david
[1:47:40] anointed by a vindicated prophet of god
[1:47:42] he's killed a lion he's killed a bear he
[1:47:44] just looks like a shepherd boy but he's
[1:47:46] king amen and he hears the boast of
[1:47:48] goliath and he just says you know
[1:47:51] who's going to fight him
[1:47:53] why is he making this boast why is
[1:47:55] someone why are you standing here and
[1:47:57] not meeting the challenge of the day
[1:47:59] why don't you take your because you're
[1:48:01] trained to do it why can't you do it but
[1:48:02] everyone's afraid because they're
[1:48:03] looking at his height but david was
[1:48:05] looking at a promise with god harlow
[1:48:08] because he was anointed to be king so
[1:48:09] therefore any enemy that came against
[1:48:11] him had to fall because he had to go to
[1:48:12] the throne it's the same thing with you
[1:48:14] and i amen we're on our way to the
[1:48:15] throne we're on our way to meet isaac
[1:48:17] hey amen the meeting in the air any
[1:48:19] enemy that comes against us god will
[1:48:21] fight our battle maybe because it wasn't
[1:48:23] david that was going to kill goliath in
[1:48:25] his own strength it was god and him
[1:48:27] going to anoint amen david picked up
[1:48:29] five stones
[1:48:31] hallelujah went against them and you
[1:48:32] know and then goliath thought you're
[1:48:34] just mocking me
[1:48:35] you're making fun of me i've made this
[1:48:37] boast for 40 days and now now israel's
[1:48:41] just pulling a prank
[1:48:43] and he says you just said i'm going to
[1:48:44] feed you a glassy what am i a dog you
[1:48:46] come against me with a stick and a safe
[1:48:48] see the devil doesn't really realize
[1:48:50] what's in you
[1:48:51] if goliath knew
[1:48:53] what was in that shepherd boy he would
[1:48:56] he would have quit i'm done
[1:48:58] who wants was attacking i don't want to
[1:49:00] fight this one
[1:49:01] if he knew the god that was in him
[1:49:03] hallelujah but the devil and his pride
[1:49:05] doesn't look at really what's within us
[1:49:07] you know we've got a resource that can
[1:49:09] make worlds
[1:49:11] within us well graham said if there
[1:49:13] wasn't a law constraining it you could
[1:49:14] create a world and live a private life
[1:49:17] on it
[1:49:18] hallelujah so there's actually unlimited
[1:49:21] power
[1:49:22] as actually in the resources and you can
[1:49:25] tap into
[1:49:26] by prayer and supplication you can
[1:49:27] actually tap into god
[1:49:30] and god can do anything
[1:49:32] hallelujah and jesus said nothing's
[1:49:34] impossible all things are possible to
[1:49:36] them that believe so why should we limit
[1:49:38] god
[1:49:39] by what we pray what we ask for but it's
[1:49:42] going to be according to his will it
[1:49:43] can't be our selfish will
[1:49:45] amen and so so dave your glass just here
[1:49:47] to my dog you come against me with
[1:49:49] sticks and stones and and then and then
[1:49:51] david just said i'm going to feed you to
[1:49:53] the birds or whatever and everyone

[1:50:27] of um first samuel 17.
[1:50:37] no no 43. and the philistines said unto
[1:50:39] david am i a dog now that they'll come
[1:50:42] us to me with staves and the philistine
[1:50:44] cursed david by his gods
[1:50:47] and the philistines said to david come
[1:50:48] to me and i'll give thy flesh into the
[1:50:50] fowls of the air and to the beasts of
[1:50:52] the field then said david to the
[1:50:54] philistine thou cometh to me with a
[1:50:56] sword and with a spear and with a shield
[1:50:58] but i come to thee in the name of the
[1:51:00] lord of hosts the god of the armies of
[1:51:02] israel
[1:51:03] who thou has defied this day will the
[1:51:06] lord deliver thee into mine hand and i
[1:51:08] will smite thee and will take thine head
[1:51:10] from thee and i will give the carcasses
[1:51:13] of the host of the philistines this day
[1:51:15] and to the fowls of the air and to the
[1:51:17] wild beasts of the earth that all the
[1:51:19] earth may know that there is a god in
[1:51:22] israel
[1:51:23] he didn't say we will he said i'm going
[1:51:24] to do it
[1:51:26] so he said basically i'm going to kill
[1:51:27] you and all of them
[1:51:29] all your friends here all these devils
[1:51:31] that's what he said he said i will
[1:51:34] hallelujah he's he's a shepherd boy with
[1:51:37] five stones you know i believe he could
[1:51:39] have done it himself
[1:51:41] because he fulfilled the first part of
[1:51:43] it
[1:51:44] he took glass head off he didn't even
[1:51:45] have his own sword he used glassware to
[1:51:47] cut his own head off this is i'm gonna
[1:51:49] i'm gonna kill you in this whole host
[1:51:51] hallelujah
[1:51:53] see the devil doesn't realize what's
[1:51:54] within us
[1:51:57] we're gonna realize what's within us
[1:51:59] i mean it wasn't david fighting the
[1:52:01] battle god anointed david to fight the
[1:52:03] battle
[1:52:04] hallelujah
[1:52:06] that's why we should be the same way
[1:52:09] amen
[1:52:11] that we were here we are
[1:52:13] he has the name in his presence he
[1:52:14] commissions his children to fulfill what
[1:52:16] they're ordained just like i'm saying
[1:52:17] david was just a shepherd boy but he was
[1:52:19] in his position and he defeated any
[1:52:21] enemy came against him just like a
[1:52:23] housewife anyone who's adopted into the
[1:52:24] body any devil comes against you you
[1:52:26] have a god-given authority to cast them
[1:52:28] out amen
[1:52:31] he has a name that's above every name
[1:52:33] everything that can be named in his name
[1:52:35] must bow to his almighty power
[1:52:38] in his presence the redeemed realize who
[1:52:40] their father is who he is and where
[1:52:42] they're going
[1:52:44] in his presence we realize who's
[1:52:46] fighting our battles in his presence we
[1:52:48] re we realize and believe that all
[1:52:50] things are possible

[1:53:17] the voice of sadness or or defeat or i
[1:53:20] think it might work no with the voice of
