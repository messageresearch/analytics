[5:47] has a table where the things of God
[5:52] invite
[5:55] [Music]
[6:00] and divide our
[6:03] orgeous reaches up
[6:07] [Music]
[6:20] [Music]
[6:34] just obey
[6:37] [Music]
[6:49] five
[6:52] [Music]
[6:58] [Music]
[7:04] [Music]
[7:30] they
[7:32] [Music]
[8:00] come and
[8:04] [Music]
[8:19] come and come and die
[8:24] [Music]
[8:49] I mean you always get satisfied when
[8:53] you're down at the Lord's table
[8:54] brother Joshua I'm like a sheep when you
[8:57] like the shepherd bro when you lead I
[8:59] follow because you're all the words here
[9:03] you know you know it's interesting
[9:10] thinking of that concept about a
[9:13] shepherd because the Shepherd always
[9:16] knows things that the sheep don't know
[9:19] and it's the sheep's job to really just
[9:23] have faith and know that the Shepherd's
[9:26] intentions are good and that
[9:27] everything's all right even if it
[9:30] doesn't seem like it's all right or even
[9:31] if you can't see what's happening
[9:34] I just had a I've got a little funny
[9:37] story so there was we suspected there
[9:41] was somebody snooping around the home
[9:43] last night in the early hours like 1:30
[9:45] and I said to Melissa
[9:47] I rang around 12 to us it rang Melissa
[9:49] and said do you did you hear that there
[9:52] was the Karen things and she said no I
[9:55] didn't but because we've definitely come
[9:57] past a house and she said I'm kind of
[9:59] scared
[10:00] you know like can you can you come down
[10:01] and you know look around so so mister
[10:05] survival man kicked into gear so I got
[10:08] my torches and
[10:11] this is not a miracle but I got my gun
[10:15] because hey you have to invite yourself
[10:17] you know you might come across three or
[10:19] four guys so I'm but I'm thinking like
[10:23] I'm not just gonna because he was deeply
[10:24] someone let me hit me right so I thought
[10:25] I'm not just gonna drive down in my care
[10:27] and like spoke four guys in like hey
[10:29] yeah didn't even know what they're up to
[10:31] you say so I thought I'll creep down oh
[10:34] well take my daughter so I hear them off
[10:36] and I'll just Creek down slowly down the
[10:37] drive with my handle you know it'd be
[10:39] like a stealth man so she's expecting me
[10:43] to turn up within about five minutes and
[10:45] you know hey everything's alright cuz
[10:46] she lives down the bottom right out in
[10:47] the country but I probably took about
[10:49] thirty minutes because I'm just sneaking
[10:51] down but all the time I could see your
[10:52] house and I'm always watching your house
[10:54] and I'm sneaking I stopped by what she
[10:56] has and I'm just checking there's no one
[10:57] around a house in there but she's and
[11:00] I'm thinking you know she doesn't know
[11:01] what I'm doing she's probably worried
[11:02] that I'm not gonna come and she's
[11:03] probably thinking oh we were see but she
[11:05] doesn't realize I'm watching a house the
[11:07] whole time it's alright
[11:08] you know I can see her house probably
[11:11] was from my position you know but she
[11:15] doesn't know that they know that's what
[11:17] I thought of the Lord you know often
[11:18] he's watching we don't know what's going
[11:20] on but he's watching he's got it all
[11:21] under control
[11:24] but everything was alright but the
[11:26] Lord's got everything under control
[11:28] I mean let's um let's think he's got the
[11:30] whole world in his hands see this is a
[11:33] different tempo please because the other

[26:05] them in his hands I mean so it's a great
[26:08] privilege today to dedicate little Lena
[26:10] Caitlin mounted to the Lord you know I
[26:13] was thinking you know you're from
[26:14] different parts of the earth mr.chair
[26:16] other Kris and brother Brennan would say
[26:19] and the unveiling of God he'd say like a
[26:21] man building chimes or making chimes the
[26:24] molder each Bell has got a ring
[26:26] different from the other the same
[26:29] materials but so much I earn so much
[26:30] steel so much brass but to give it the
[26:34] ting hmm that's the way God did he
[26:37] breathed this one - that one - this one
[26:39] - that one - this one - that one until
[26:41] he got exactly what he wanted and I
[26:43] believe little eNOS got a special ting
[26:45] that the Lord wanted upon me with a
[26:47] special sound that she had to come by
[26:50] you but God had in his mind before the
[26:54] foundation of the world that she would
[26:55] be brought in this season now I was
[26:57] looking at her name I love the meaning
[26:59] of names I'm sure you've you know looked
[27:00] as well and the Lena we know it means
[27:03] light Caitlin means pure and mounta I
[27:08] was looking at the name mounter and it
[27:11] means of course a amount of hill but the
[27:14] suffix
[27:16] winner's attached to a topographical
[27:20] feature means the dweller at something
[27:22] so there's a the dweller at the mountain
[27:24] and I was thinking you know as Jesus
[27:27] would say in Matthew 5 yeah the light of
[27:29] the world a city that is set on a hill
[27:31] cannot be hid neither do men light a
[27:33] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[27:36] a candlestick and it giveth light unto
[27:37] all that are in the house that your
[27:40] light so shine before men that they may
[27:42] see your good works and glorify your
[27:44] father which is in heaven
[27:46] and brother bran would speak of our
[27:48] future home he says in the future home
[27:51] of the heavenly bridegroom earthy bride
[27:52] he says now you've got the city see it's
[27:55] a holy mountain nothing shall hurt or
[27:58] destroy in all my holy mountain say at
[28:00] the Lord the city is not a cube it's a
[28:02] mountain and the width by the breadth by
[28:04] the height that equal see 5th
[28:06] 900 miles away 1,500 miles that way
[28:09] 1,500 miles all around and 1500 miles
[28:11] high so it's a great mountain like the
[28:13] pyramid and the city is on the mountain
[28:15] he says glory so here's a dweller I
[28:18] believe she's going to be a dweller on
[28:19] the mountain I'm in that future home so
[28:22] I pray that she will be a pure light I
[28:25] know that's your heart desire to that
[28:28] she'll be the light of the world we need
[28:30] little ones to manifest this word as

[48:52] the people of the God of Abraham for the
[48:55] shields of the earth belong unto God he
[48:58] is greatly exalted I mean may the Lord
[49:01] bless his word you may have your seats
[49:02] this morning I want to I want to take a
[49:04] if I could title this I want to speak
[49:07] about removing the stigma of your past
[49:11] now now we know the word is eternal you
[49:14] know it speaks to all people all
[49:16] generations and you know all scriptures
[49:19] for reproof for doctrine for exhortation
[49:21] you know all Scripture is that but we
[49:23] but I want you to notice that that
[49:25] there's there's a few of the Psalms and
[49:27] they are directed to the sons of korah
[49:29] and God is wanting to show us something
[49:31] and this is not just God filling up ink
[49:34] on paper you know but there is a reason
[49:36] why they are directed to the sons of
[49:38] korah or for the sons of korah now the
[49:41] sons of korah we know kora was one that
[49:44] that would would raise up during when
[49:46] when Israel was going for in from Egypt
[49:49] into the Promised Land he he he rose up
[49:51] he was a man of renown and any and he
[49:53] rose up with with the young you know
[49:56] with Dathan and abiram and and the great
[49:59] princes and they rose up before moses
[50:01] and you know with certain of the
[50:03] children of israel now i'm reading
[50:04] number 16 two hundred and fifty princes
[50:07] of the assembly famous and the
[50:08] congregation men every now and this is
[50:09] core here here's a famous one in an
[50:12] israel he had great influence and
[50:14] something moved in his heart that he
[50:16] wasn't happy with god's provided way of
[50:18] god speaking directly through moses the
[50:20] Word of God to lead them into the
[50:22] Promised Land so because of his great
[50:24] influence they begin to speak among
[50:26] themselves and they had a better idea of
[50:27] doing it and whenever man has a better
[50:29] idea there's one thing for sure it's the
[50:31] wrong idea
[50:32] God is always right his word is always
[50:34] correct amen every time so they rose up
[50:38] and they they they rose up before Moses
[50:40] and they gathered themselves together
[50:42] against Moses and against Aaron and they
[50:44] sit unto them you take too much upon you
[50:46] seeing all the congregation are holy
[50:48] every one of them and the Lord is among
[50:51] them wherefore then lift ye up
[50:52] yourselves above the congregation of the
[50:56] lords so they were actually accusing
[50:57] them you're actually placing yourself in
[50:59] this position but God put them in that
[51:01] position and so sure the whole
[51:03] Congressional vote was holy because God
[51:05] was in their midst but God placed
[51:07] officers in Israel and Moses and Aaron
[51:10] happened to be the Prophet and the high
[51:12] priest they were placed in those offices
[51:14] so they were saying you've lifted
[51:16] yourselves up but of course they didn't
[51:18] God put them there
[51:19] and so now Moses yeah we won't continue
[51:22] reading but Moses basically said you
[51:24] know well God's going to show you whose
[51:26] side is on whose side and you know if
[51:28] God does a new thing and the earth
[51:29] swallows you up you'll know whose side
[51:31] their God is on and they separate
[51:34] themselves from them the earth swallowed
[51:35] them up and cut you and and they all
[51:37] perished and even Jude would speak about
[51:40] this is the gainsaying of korah
[51:42] so these gained sayings are men with a
[51:44] political spirit political mind rising
[51:47] up against the order of God trying to
[51:48] take control now this was Cora now the
[51:54] scripture says that that in numbers 26
[51:57] and 11 notwithstanding the children of
[52:00] Korah died not so that Korah died but
[52:03] his children weren't caught up in this
[52:05] and this in this event but now imagine
[52:10] the stigma your daddy was now part of
[52:14] this rebellion remember in Israel
[52:17] lineage was everything they were the son
[52:19] of the son of whoever you know so
[52:20] lineage was everything so there was now
[52:22] a stigma attached to Cora's name so to
[52:25] be now a son of Korah what was then the
[52:28] father we know is passed down into the
[52:30] children so the same attributes are
[52:32] potentially now in the children so they
[52:34] carried that stigma with them now I
[52:36] remember when I was young maybe I was
[52:38] and Lisa Lily as age and my dad read us
[52:41] from the Bible when we read about the
[52:42] first murder on the earth of course Cain
[52:44] killed Abel and there was a little boy
[52:46] at my school I don't know if he is in my
[52:48] class but I the next day I went and told
[52:50] him you know you're named after the
[52:51] first murderer in the world I know I
[52:55] don't have much filter going on uh-huh I
[52:57] hope I got more of a filter now think
[52:59] before speak but you know imagine if he
[53:02] was I don't think he was a Christian or
[53:03] but imagine if he was a Christian he
[53:05] would have now a stigma attached to his
[53:07] name you mean I'm named after a murderer
[53:10] yeah there'll be a stigma attached to it
[53:12] so now there was a stigma attached to
[53:14] Korres name now we have a stigma
[53:17] attached to our past and the devil wants
[53:20] to hold our past against us it may not
[53:23] be what we've done maybe what we our
[53:25] parents have done maybe our grandparents
[53:27] whoever it may be but there's a stigma
[53:29] attached to sins that people have done
[53:31] and the devil wants to hold it against
[53:34] you to stop you coming into your
[53:35] god-given god-given place I mean we're
[53:39] going to understand our Lord has taken
[53:40] care of it all hallelujah so now know so
[53:44] the children of Korah died not with the
[53:46] gain things of their father but there
[53:48] was a great stigma you know associated
[53:51] with Cora's name you know so if I told
[53:54] some some kid at school he's named after
[53:56] a murderer how do you think they would
[53:58] have been in Israel oh you're the sons
[54:01] of Korah you know because imagine
[54:03] sitting there listening to the tour of
[54:05] being read and you are a son of Korah
[54:07] and I come into numbers think about the
[54:09] gang saying of core and what kora did
[54:11] there be a stigma attached to it you'd
[54:13] feel bad that you're called that way he
[54:16] followed me I mean so they would have
[54:19] been living under that condemnation but
[54:21] God don't want us to live under the
[54:23] condemnation of the past he wants us
[54:25] free of it
[54:25] I mean cuz if God don't remember why
[54:27] should we remember if God doesn't hold
[54:30] it against you why should we hold it
[54:31] against ourselves hallelujah so Cora now
[54:35] you know and and it's amazing the
[54:37] influence that Cora and Dathan had
[54:39] because after Moses said well you know
[54:42] if God do a new thing in the earth
[54:44] swallow you up and it did yet you keep
[54:47] reading God in numbers 16 it says in
[54:49] verse 41 but on the morrow all the
[54:51] Congress of Israel murmured against
[54:54] Moses and against Aaron because saying
[54:56] ye have killed the people of the Lord so
[54:59] they had that kind of influence upon the
[55:01] congregation even though God suppressed
[55:02] she said no that they're not speaking
[55:04] for me that people had a so twisted in
[55:06] their mind they were God's people that's
[55:09] how strong the influence was but now so
[55:12] here are these sons of korah
[55:14] living under this stigma for generations
[55:18] but there comes a time when the stigma
[55:22] does not remain
[55:23] that's why we read I you know that's why
[55:26] I pointed out to you that those these
[55:28] Psalms are written for the sons of Korah
[55:30] so God is taking God is taking David
[55:33] who's king he's anointed he's brucey
[55:36] placed in the body he would prophesy
[55:38] speaking first person of Calvary my God
[55:41] my God why self a sake admitted so
[55:44] moving his life he - he'd speak first
[55:46] person of future events like he was
[55:48] there he had began to prophesy things
[55:50] and they're still coming to pass and he
[55:52] would use God would use his lips I mean
[55:55] to address the sons of korah how they're
[55:57] to say now this this word that's being
[55:59] released now you're going to receive
[56:01] this song and you're going to be
[56:02] anointed I mean hallelu to sing forth
[56:04] the praise of God so what - what David
[56:07] did now no I'm gonna try and slow down
[56:12] we know that in this day we have journey
[56:17] through a wilderness the church came out
[56:20] of Egypt now are in the promised land
[56:23] but there was a wilderness journey there
[56:25] was fighting there was all things going
[56:27] on people wandering around lots of sins
[56:29] and things happening but now we're
[56:31] living in a new day where we're even
[56:34] Moses would tell the children of Israel
[56:36] and Judah enemy 29 and to me it's
[56:38] astounding he says that you know so
[56:39] Deuteronomy as 40 years they've been in
[56:42] the wilderness for 40 years they're
[56:43] about to go into the Promised Land and
[56:45] he tells us roll you saw the miracles
[56:48] God did in Egypt you saw everything he
[56:50] did for you yet God has not given you
[56:52] eyes to see your heart to perceive until
[56:54] this day so they walked with a pillar of
[56:57] fire they went across the Red Sea they
[56:59] were fed manner out of the wilderness
[57:00] they saw God come down on the on the
[57:02] tabernacle and all incredible things
[57:04] they saw God come down a Mount Sinai
[57:07] they saw all those things but yet God's
[57:09] but Moses say no you don't you didn't
[57:11] understand what was going on but now you
[57:13] do and you're about to go in holy and
[57:17] it's the same thing people in the
[57:18] message have been journeying for 40 50
[57:20] years now but now God is causing the
[57:22] lights to turn on where it's more than
[57:25] quotes more than debates more than
[57:26] doctrine but a living reality of a
[57:28] living God and a people where people are
[57:30] now possessing their inheritance we're
[57:32] living in a different hour
[57:34] hallelujah so now so so to me now you
[57:37] know the message has always been the
[57:38] same but but I believe the potency of it
[57:40] the reality of it the potency of the
[57:43] word is so much more richer now because
[57:45] God's given us eyes to see we never did
[57:48] it in the first place where's the first
[57:49] place God's thinking I mean when he saw
[57:51] you before the foundation of the world
[57:53] when he would address Jobe in his trial
[57:55] where were you when I laid the
[57:57] foundations of the world the morning
[57:59] stars shouted for joy and guys trying to
[58:01] get job to see him to realize you were
[58:03] in my thinking you were there before
[58:06] before there's ever a molecule upon the
[58:08] earth you and me hallelujah and that's
[58:11] why when the Prophet said you never did
[58:12] it in the first place well where's the
[58:14] first place God's thinking of you before
[58:16] the foundation of the world I mean so if
[58:18] he saw me rejoicing hallelujah I want to
[58:20] manifest that Amen why should we you
[58:25] know I'm not gonna let a rock cry out in
[58:27] my place and it's not shouting for the
[58:29] sake of shouting it's shouting because
[58:31] of Revelation it's shouting because I'm
[58:33] free it's rejoicing because I'm a free
[58:35] person I mean this Liberty in this place
[58:37] how they should mean Liberty in our
[58:39] lives that we should be free to express
[58:41] ourselves how we feel - well you sound
[58:45] quiet well that's fine but don't resume
[58:47] the people who allowed you say I'm loud
[58:49] well don't resume the people who are
[58:50] quiet you should be free to express
[58:52] yourself how you want to express
[58:54] yourself because of its God doing it
[58:56] it's an order you know a Billy Paul
[58:59] Brandon would tell the story and I've
[59:01] said it before but there'd be a woman
[59:02] who had heard swung her handbag and bam
[59:04] tabernacle and she had throw it across
[59:06] the church when she got so excited I've
[59:08] never heard her tank where brother
[59:10] Brahim said stop that now sister that's
[59:11] wrong why cuz God was doing it you know
[59:16] their stories are y'all heard the other
[59:17] day brother brandman you know at the end
[59:18] of meetings you take his coat he'd swing
[59:20] it around and around and around
[59:21] rejoicing and he'd go outside and swing
[59:23] it around and around rejoicing oh my we
[59:26] got to have the right we are Free People
[59:31] amen what we should shout with the voice
[59:33] of triumph Kali we've got the victory
[59:36] we're on the victors side hallelujah
[59:40] amen so here they were now when David
[59:46] became King and the kingdom was
[59:49] established under David they possessed
[59:52] the fullness of the promised land they
[59:54] never possessed it in the days of Joshua
[59:56] they possessed all that was promised
[59:58] through Moses in the kingship of David
[1:00:00] so when the king came to the throne then
[1:00:03] they took the full inheritance and it's
[1:00:05] the same thing today through the church
[1:00:07] ages where your people have gained
[1:00:08] ground they've gained a possession but
[1:00:11] it's when the King steps forth and takes
[1:00:13] over there is no longer church ages but
[1:00:16] now it's the son of man I mean the king
[1:00:18] himself stepping into the church and
[1:00:20] taking over that's when the fullness of
[1:00:22] the inheritance of the word I mean we
[1:00:23] receive it hallelujah I mean under the
[1:00:26] days of Moses they didn't take all the
[1:00:28] way to the the review Freddie's so there
[1:00:31] was parts of the word that they didn't
[1:00:32] possess but then when David came to the
[1:00:35] throne any any way and he went in
[1:00:37] conquered there and he possessed it why
[1:00:40] because the king came to the throne and
[1:00:43] so now under David we had people coming
[1:00:46] into an adoption right David instituted
[1:00:50] the singers Institute a different temple
[1:00:52] worship even before there was the temple
[1:00:54] built he received the inspiration for
[1:00:56] the temple to be built but he began to
[1:00:58] put things in place that wins when
[1:01:00] Solomon would finally put the physical
[1:01:01] temple together everything was there
[1:01:03] that the worship could be instituted so
[1:01:06] under the kingship of David people came
[1:01:07] to their adoption the mighty men came to
[1:01:09] their adoption now adoption we know is
[1:01:11] placing in the body right so now the
[1:01:13] mighty men before David came to the
[1:01:15] throne they were just Gentiles they were
[1:01:17] just vagabonds destitute afflicted
[1:01:19] whatever they were and distressed
[1:01:21] tormented but then under the anointing
[1:01:23] that was on David they came to their
[1:01:25] position in the body right they came to
[1:01:27] their adoption just like the sons of
[1:01:29] Korah they had a stigma to their name I
[1:01:31] remember then David on the inspiration
[1:01:33] of the Holy Ghost God told him no take
[1:01:35] the sons of korah place them in the
[1:01:37] worship place them in a very influential
[1:01:39] place Amen we
[1:01:41] where their father could not be I mean
[1:01:43] I'm going to put the sons and I'm gonna
[1:01:45] put the sons in a show that the stigma
[1:01:46] attached to their name has been scrubbed
[1:01:48] off I mean that I don't see it no more I
[1:01:51] mean but now they are in their position
[1:01:53] hallelujah glory to go man that should
[1:01:57] make you real happy why does it make you
[1:02:00] feel happy because there was a stigma
[1:02:01] attached to our first nature amen sin
[1:02:05] was yeah we were born with sin nature
[1:02:06] we're born and darkness doesn't matter
[1:02:09] who you who you are what your last name
[1:02:12] is a man we must be born again there's
[1:02:14] got to be God's got to transform your
[1:02:16] life and change you so there's a stigma
[1:02:18] with our first birth with our first name
[1:02:20] but I remember when brother brems
[1:02:21] preached the first seal he says that
[1:02:24] you'll understand I no longer call the
[1:02:26] church but I call you bride why does he
[1:02:29] why are we no longer called church
[1:02:31] because there's a stigma associated with
[1:02:33] the name Church I mean with church
[1:02:36] there's a stigma off men's ideas man's
[1:02:38] dogma man controlling man all those
[1:02:40] different things going on hierarchy
[1:02:42] politics whatever it may be that's all
[1:02:44] associated with the name church they
[1:02:46] said I'm not calling you that name no
[1:02:48] more gonna call you bride you're under a
[1:02:50] different dispensation now you're in a
[1:02:52] different office now I mean because now
[1:02:54] bride the bride of Jesus Christ is no
[1:02:57] stigma with that name wholly away
[1:03:00] because everything we are we are because
[1:03:02] of him I mean we no longer have our own
[1:03:04] identity Holly we have his identity Amen
[1:03:08] just like when when Ruth Ruth came into
[1:03:10] Israel
[1:03:11] she was cheered a stigma she was a mob
[1:03:14] itis the law said no mob I could into
[1:03:16] the congregation of Israel there was a
[1:03:19] stigma she is a widow worth nothing I
[1:03:21] mean there's a stigma under her mother
[1:03:23] yeah you're over a mother-in-law don't
[1:03:25] call me Naomi no more call me Mara my
[1:03:29] life's become better why there's a
[1:03:33] stigma associated with it but then when
[1:03:36] Boaz came
[1:03:37] when Bowens came to the field and saw
[1:03:40] and saw Rusia fell in love with her
[1:03:42] hallelujah amen and and took her his
[1:03:45] wife I mean now she had no stigma
[1:03:47] associated to her name because she's no
[1:03:50] longer Ruth from Moab now she was Ruth
[1:03:52] of Bethlehem she was the wife of boy's
[1:03:54] father it's the same thing with us I
[1:03:57] mean how God is taking care of our paws
[1:03:59] she say I I wrestle with a lot of things
[1:04:02] just give it to him he's already taking
[1:04:04] care of it parlor he's already taking
[1:04:06] care of your pass you say well a fool of
[1:04:08] many times just get back up I mean he's
[1:04:10] already taking care of us hallelujah has
[1:04:14] he not I mean when he died on Calvary he
[1:04:17] didn't say well I got you know I need to
[1:04:19] dog in at the end of the age I mean to
[1:04:21] to to take care of all the sins in the
[1:04:22] future no he took care of it all from it
[1:04:26] from when sin first came in to when sin
[1:04:28] will end he took care of it all under
[1:04:31] that blood hallelujah so if he took care
[1:04:34] of it all I mean we just got to have
[1:04:35] such confidence Lord you've done it
[1:04:37] you've taken away yeah the devil tries
[1:04:40] to put a stigma on us you did this you
[1:04:43] said this you thought this you acted
[1:04:44] this way
[1:04:45] Amen you say no devil that person died
[1:04:51] I'm an overcomer I've had overcome you
[1:04:55] by the blood of Jesus Christ member this
[1:04:58] message is a positioning message it's an
[1:05:00] adoption message
[1:05:01] I mean if it's adoption message
[1:05:03] therefore we will be placed as the Bride
[1:05:05] of Christ and I believe now we are being
[1:05:07] places the Bride of Christ we're not
[1:05:09] looking for a future event now this word
[1:05:12] I mean it's here to place you in your
[1:05:13] place hallelujah amen
[1:05:17] that's something is shout about I mean
[1:05:20] oz wants us I was once like the sons of
[1:05:23] korah Oh your daddy did this or you did
[1:05:26] this under your first breath look at
[1:05:27] this puts a weight on you imagine them
[1:05:31] let's not have a family you know family
[1:05:34] you NuWave you know they were they were
[1:05:36] stuck with this name they couldn't
[1:05:38] change this name but one step to the
[1:05:40] throne hallelu they had the short
[1:05:42] mercies of David and he and God said no
[1:05:45] no no no don't let them live under that
[1:05:46] anymore place them here place them here
[1:05:49] is the worshipers
[1:05:51] and I'm gonna speak through you Psalms
[1:05:53] and they're going to receive that
[1:05:54] inspiration of that Psalm they're gonna
[1:05:55] sing it forth themselves and the same
[1:05:57] inspiration that fell upon you is going
[1:05:59] to fall upon there and then they're
[1:06:00] going to sing it and then to create an
[1:06:02] atmosphere and I'm gonna come down and
[1:06:03] dwell in their praise how that's the
[1:06:05] same thing Amen God anointed the Prophet
[1:06:07] hallelujah and God spoke forth a word
[1:06:09] amen and then and then God took us
[1:06:12] placed us in our position we received
[1:06:13] that word holy the same inspiration
[1:06:15] falls upon us holy then God comes down
[1:06:18] among us hallelujah Amen I happen to
[1:06:22] believe that because the only way that
[1:06:25] this message can livers of the same
[1:06:27] inspiration that it was given in it
[1:06:28] falls upon you I mean the same Holy
[1:06:31] Ghost that anointed that man's lips
[1:06:33] brother Browns lips to speak it comes
[1:06:34] upon you for you to receive it
[1:06:37] hallelujah and I believe that
[1:06:39] inspiration is present that's been here
[1:06:42] quite a while
[1:06:43] hallelujah it's been waiting for you and
[1:06:46] here you are hallelujah
[1:06:50] so they came to their adoption amen
[1:06:54] under the kingship of David now brother
[1:06:58] bran would say what to me to me when we
[1:07:02] when we when you read through the seal
[1:07:05] series it's not it's not some sermons
[1:07:07] it's an event
[1:07:09] he would stand there in the breech and
[1:07:11] he would go to revelations four and five
[1:07:13] and he would begin to come down to the
[1:07:15] scripture where it says and a mighty and
[1:07:18] a strong angel called he said who's
[1:07:21] worthy to take the book he says maybe I
[1:07:24] just feeling this way but who let him
[1:07:27] come well inspiration was coming and he
[1:07:30] said every everyday the angel Lord would
[1:07:32] come into the room and tell them what
[1:07:33] the seer was the book would come open to
[1:07:35] the Prophet - to be given to us so so
[1:07:38] here it was what was happening when John
[1:07:40] was there up in the eternity
[1:07:42] he saw no one was worthy to take the
[1:07:44] book what are the elders said we've not
[1:07:46] John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:07:49] has revealed the Kings prevailed and but
[1:07:52] when he looked he saw a lamb now to some
[1:07:55] people he's King he's judge right but to
[1:07:59] the bride he's lying I mean I mean so
[1:08:00] he's lamb
[1:08:02] I mean he's both things at once I mean
[1:08:04] but the Sami rules out as judgment but
[1:08:07] but the others he shows mercy hallelujah
[1:08:10] and it's by our relationship to her me
[1:08:12] shows us mercy
[1:08:13] we're always part of them we're ice part
[1:08:17] of us word Amen so so he's our lamb he's
[1:08:20] my sacrifice
[1:08:21] he's my high priest amen he's my he's my
[1:08:24] propitiation he's my advocate he's my
[1:08:27] husband he's my he's my lord he's my
[1:08:30] everything so now what's happening now
[1:08:32] as the king is coming forth to take over
[1:08:36] what happened when Jesus came the first
[1:08:38] time because remember the church when
[1:08:43] Jesus came or the Old Testament church
[1:08:45] when Jesus came it was all when he came
[1:08:47] what they have man-made systems man-made
[1:08:51] ideas it was all just the church doing
[1:08:53] this thing but then he cared the King to
[1:08:56] come to his church and they didn't want
[1:08:58] him some of them accepted but most
[1:09:01] didn't why because headship was coming
[1:09:02] to the body but Israel wouldn't accept
[1:09:05] it and then so what happens down the end
[1:09:07] time a chip comes to the body
[1:09:10] hallelujah but there's a body upon the
[1:09:12] earth to receive it though the majority
[1:09:14] may not I mean these are prepared people
[1:09:16] that will receive the headship of the
[1:09:18] word and will become one with him and
[1:09:20] I'm looking at her right now
[1:09:22] hallelujah so now here comes the king
[1:09:25] he's got the contents of the kingdom he
[1:09:29] opens it up and he begins to speak it
[1:09:32] forth and as he speaks a fourth now
[1:09:35] people are taking their position
[1:09:36] remember under the under the
[1:09:38] administration of Moses and Joshua it
[1:09:41] wasn't just Israel receiving their
[1:09:43] inheritance or get or having their place
[1:09:45] Moses they yeah you know God tells Moses
[1:09:48] his Moab
[1:09:49] leave them alone just journey through
[1:09:51] different ones this is their portion
[1:09:52] they weren't in the promised land but
[1:09:54] they were you know they were actually
[1:09:56] related to Israel through life and his
[1:09:58] daughters and so on so just leave them
[1:10:00] where they are just keep journeying
[1:10:01] through you know if there's trouble well
[1:10:03] there'll be trouble but you you just
[1:10:05] leave them where their leave the church
[1:10:06] nominal where they I don't facet them
[1:10:08] there's the bride call it they have
[1:10:11] their place right we have our place a
[1:10:13] mess just God's grace we have
[1:10:15] our place and it's not that place so
[1:10:18] never look down just keep churning
[1:10:19] through keep walking with the Lord right
[1:10:21] so one just Israel receiving their
[1:10:23] inheritance they all had their allotment
[1:10:25] as well amen
[1:10:27] so now so when the book came open it
[1:10:32] wasn't just the bride receiving her lot
[1:10:33] the devil's going to lake of fire right
[1:10:37] maybe what was sitting in there the
[1:10:38] whole time but now it's time for it to
[1:10:40] be manifested this is who's going for
[1:10:42] the lake of fire this is going to
[1:10:43] receive what mercy the white throne
[1:10:44] judgment the bride won't be judged
[1:10:46] Christ took her judgment that down
[1:10:48] Calvary
[1:10:48] hallelujah she's going to be judging the
[1:10:50] world amen the Saints will judge the
[1:10:52] earth right so everyone receives their
[1:10:55] portion Allu you we just happen to
[1:10:58] receive the best portion but there's
[1:10:59] nothing we did it's God's predestination
[1:11:02] hallelujah that's why we should just be
[1:11:04] glad Lord I'm so glad you made me me and
[1:11:06] you I'm so glad you called me
[1:11:08] under this word hallelujah amen so now
[1:11:13] the king has come and now we received
[1:11:16] the full inheritance of the word
[1:11:18] hallelujah amen now Jesus would say to
[1:11:27] his disciples I'm kind of jumping in
[1:11:30] around maybe but he would say to his
[1:11:32] disciples after they were sent to to
[1:11:35] cast out devils and and you know heal
[1:11:37] the sick and so on they came back
[1:11:38] rejoicing and Jesus would say to them
[1:11:41] don't rejoice that you have dominion
[1:11:42] over unclean spirits but rejoice rather
[1:11:46] because your names are written in heaven
[1:11:48] amen now we must understand that that
[1:11:52] had me Judas was with them so these
[1:11:57] names we know if you you know I'm sure
[1:11:59] we're all familiar with this but this
[1:12:00] but there's there's parts of the book of
[1:12:02] life I mean or in the book of life that
[1:12:05] that names can be rubbed out and Judas
[1:12:07] his name was written in heaven but it
[1:12:08] was erased because isn't that but his
[1:12:10] name wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:12] right so now though sure in the Lamb's
[1:12:14] Book of Life will not worship the beast
[1:12:17] they actually sees in the book of
[1:12:19] Revelation that they will have right to
[1:12:20] go into the city and dwell there now the
[1:12:24] last book of life we know it's it's a
[1:12:27] record of names
[1:12:29] that God thought of before the
[1:12:31] foundation of the world that they will
[1:12:32] rule and reign with him and Jesus is
[1:12:35] saying don't rejoice just because of
[1:12:37] this but rather rejoice because your
[1:12:38] names are written in heaven so we should
[1:12:40] rejoice not because people are healed
[1:12:43] necessarily though that is wonderful but
[1:12:45] you should rejoice that your name is in
[1:12:47] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:48] because remember if it's sudden their
[1:12:50] brother James sent me a quote you know
[1:12:51] brother Bram said that no your no
[1:12:54] rubbing all the rubbing compound in the
[1:12:56] earth brother Bram said couldn't take
[1:12:57] your name off that book Talia said
[1:12:59] nothing can take a remember all those
[1:13:01] names they mean the devil can't take he
[1:13:04] can't take those names he can't take
[1:13:06] those lives I'm in their gods and if our
[1:13:09] gods Amen that nothing can pluck them
[1:13:11] from his hand they belong to him
[1:13:14] kaalia so now if they are in the know if
[1:13:16] our names are in that book I mean God
[1:13:19] has to take all claims the devil can put
[1:13:22] upon us I mean and that's why I'm in the
[1:13:24] blood of Jesus Christ amen as I said
[1:13:26] takes care of our past president future
[1:13:30] Amen so therefore there's nothing that
[1:13:32] he can hold against us because our Lord
[1:13:34] took care of it all
[1:13:35] holy it's like the sons of Korah I mean
[1:13:38] we can sing praises unto our God I mean
[1:13:41] we can rejoice Amy will you say thank
[1:13:43] you Lord we don't have to live under the
[1:13:44] stigma of our first birth or what our
[1:13:46] parents did whoever did Amy but we can
[1:13:48] rejoice I because God your places and
[1:13:51] the body to sing praises unto you I mean
[1:13:53] they're more than just singers in the
[1:13:55] temple Amen but worshipers and spirit
[1:13:57] and truth I'm in the Bride of Christ
[1:13:58] yourself hallelujah that's why we should
[1:14:01] rejoice amen isn't it wonderful God has
[1:14:07] a record of us in heaven and that's why
[1:14:10] we've got to understand as young as
[1:14:11] brother Aaron would say there's only one
[1:14:12] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:14:14] life the scripture says who has the son
[1:14:16] has life eternal life who has not the
[1:14:19] son doesn't have eternal life
[1:14:20] and so now but he said amen to in order
[1:14:23] to have eternal life you did not have a
[1:14:25] beginning because it's because eternity
[1:14:27] has no beginning has no end so now when
[1:14:30] you think about that it shows us that if
[1:14:31] you have received the Holy Ghost today I
[1:14:34] mean this word has become a living
[1:14:36] reality in you I mean that's actually a
[1:14:38] vindication to you that you have eternal
[1:14:40] life I'm not talking just about
[1:14:42] anointing but when the wood comes down
[1:14:44] into your soul amen and you begin to
[1:14:46] manifest this message today more than
[1:14:49] just an anointing people get anointed
[1:14:50] but they're still got their old nature
[1:14:51] living but those who have truly strained
[1:14:53] at all and God lives through them
[1:14:56] hallelujah amen so it's so it's showing
[1:15:00] by receiving the Holy Ghost is actually
[1:15:03] God saying to you I'm putting my seal
[1:15:05] upon you that you would know you're with
[1:15:07] me from the foundation of the world
[1:15:10] hallelujah now Joshua I'm just going to
[1:15:14] go back to Joshua again well rather than
[1:15:21] going to read a definition this is what
[1:15:23] I was going to originally title this was
[1:15:26] to be impacted by the supernatural now
[1:15:30] to be impacted it means you come into a
[1:15:31] forcible contact with another object
[1:15:33] that's being impacted and some of us
[1:15:36] have been impacted by bigger things or
[1:15:38] lesser things but although what it feels
[1:15:40] like to be impacted by something now
[1:15:43] Joshua took the people into the land and
[1:15:46] they were instructed they were
[1:15:49] instructed to walk around jericho
[1:15:51] certain number of times
[1:15:54] christina having fellowship with us
[1:15:55] yesterday I believe it was or day before
[1:15:57] and but on the seventh time around
[1:15:59] member of silence until a certain point
[1:16:02] and in the trumpets blew and the people
[1:16:04] shouted now I do with a great shout now
[1:16:07] just what do you think about this they
[1:16:09] were under expectation to see the walls
[1:16:11] come down remember they had just crossed
[1:16:14] Jordan and I was on dry ground I
[1:16:16] mentioned I was just thinking about this
[1:16:18] rejoicing imagine imagine you you know
[1:16:20] Jordan wasn't flood in that kind of
[1:16:23] season it was there was the harvest
[1:16:25] season that they came into came into the
[1:16:27] Promised Land and so so it's banks were
[1:16:29] swollen but then imagine you're walking
[1:16:32] so so you're way in the back somewhere
[1:16:34] and you're walking over you come over
[1:16:36] the hill and you see where the Jordan
[1:16:38] wasn't as dry ground and you see four
[1:16:41] priests holding an ark in the middle of
[1:16:42] the river
[1:16:43] you just see this and you're walking
[1:16:46] past this you're walking past and you
[1:16:49] just see these men you walk over and dry
[1:16:51] ground and then after you've once
[1:16:55] crossed then you see those same four men
[1:16:57] with the outcome over and maybe you
[1:16:59] don't look back and go see where's that
[1:17:00] river and it's flowing they give it put
[1:17:05] yourself I put myself in Bible stories
[1:17:07] imagine seeing that and you've already
[1:17:10] been in the wilderness you've seen
[1:17:11] mighty things God has done that put them
[1:17:15] an expectation for the walls to come
[1:17:17] down I say everything that God has ever
[1:17:20] ever done for you put it in an order he
[1:17:23] did all this for me he's gonna do all
[1:17:26] this for me I mean because remember the
[1:17:28] works have been finished from the
[1:17:30] foundation of the world I mean so every
[1:17:32] every miracle God over do you say this
[1:17:34] long this list is this long if he's
[1:17:37] already done this but he has to do this
[1:17:39] but I think it's the same God that did
[1:17:41] the stuff in the beginning will do the
[1:17:42] rest
[1:17:42] right amen see here they were there and
[1:17:45] the expectation I don't believe they're
[1:17:46] walking around saying what are we doing
[1:17:48] they didn't walk around saying no no
[1:17:50] remember we cross that River that was on
[1:17:53] dry ground Joe the same God that was
[1:17:55] with Moses as with Joshua that same
[1:17:57] presences that was with Moses now with
[1:17:59] this man he said he met the captain our
[1:18:01] host and Lord he instructed him what to
[1:18:03] do and we're walking around hallelujah
[1:18:05] and we heard the spies report and they
[1:18:07] said the hearts of all the men have
[1:18:09] failed because of what God did for us in
[1:18:11] Egypt and he'll do it again
[1:18:13] you'll do it again Lord you'll do it
[1:18:14] again Olli will do it again Lord you
[1:18:17] saved me you'll do it again save my
[1:18:19] children how do you help me once you'll
[1:18:20] do it again you heal me again I mean
[1:18:22] what I've been financial need you help
[1:18:24] me then you'll do it again
[1:18:25] probably when I couldn't find my way
[1:18:27] you'll do it again off I'll find my way
[1:18:31] so they walked around under expectation
[1:18:34] that's why I say well we'll go to prayer
[1:18:36] request we should have no expectation oh
[1:18:38] we've got a trouble or something we
[1:18:40] should be under expectation God's gonna
[1:18:42] fight your battle Amen mimic this is
[1:18:44] God's bride
[1:18:45] we are his bride here's our husband
[1:18:47] we're his life amen if we're his wife
[1:18:50] then we're under his Dominion we're
[1:18:51] under his care his protection
[1:18:53] he'll guide us through he said well what
[1:18:56] about the martyrs in the and the in the
[1:18:58] murder age they died in faith because
[1:19:02] God wants to show the devil doesn't
[1:19:04] matter what you do to people they will
[1:19:06] still believe and love me hallelujah
[1:19:09] brother bran tell a story it was about a
[1:19:12] woman I you know I don't have the quote
[1:19:14] here but but there was a woman in
[1:19:15] Germany and and they just had a newborn
[1:19:18] baby and the baby was actually died and
[1:19:20] now calling for brother Branham to come
[1:19:22] from the United States to come to
[1:19:24] Germany to pray for the baby that the
[1:19:25] baby would come back and live and now
[1:19:27] brother Baron prayed and the Lord said
[1:19:29] no this is the hand of God tell them
[1:19:31] this is a and so he related that message
[1:19:35] to the parents and in a while later the
[1:19:37] parents came to America and then she was
[1:19:40] asking brother baron was it because of a
[1:19:41] lack of faith that my baby wasn't raised
[1:19:44] to the dead and and he said no no you
[1:19:46] have great faith but he said no no but
[1:19:50] you still love the Lord anyhow it's not
[1:19:53] based on if your baby was raised or not
[1:19:56] because she she kept walking on loving
[1:19:58] God anyway irrespective of what happened
[1:20:01] and the Prophet didn't actually you have
[1:20:03] great faith because your circumstance of
[1:20:05] what's happened to your life has not
[1:20:07] changed your love for God hallelujah
[1:20:10] because remember having having the
[1:20:12] revelation the hour does not exempt us
[1:20:14] from trouble it does not exempt us from
[1:20:16] trials it does not exempt us from
[1:20:18] hardship I mean but the revelation of
[1:20:20] the hour gives us overcoming power that
[1:20:22] our faith will not waver irrespective of
[1:20:25] what's going
[1:20:26] how they just like jobim a job was an
[1:20:29] extreme case God just said you're
[1:20:31] Satan's head to God well you just put a
[1:20:33] he'd drown job that's why he loves you
[1:20:34] and and God said well I'm gonna prove
[1:20:36] you wrong and so job was on his ash heap
[1:20:39] he was they're all in this trouble but
[1:20:40] yet with his mouth he did not sin
[1:20:42] against God he had great faith he didn't
[1:20:45] understand what was going on and
[1:20:46] remember there has never been once in my
[1:20:49] life with God sat me down and said okay
[1:20:50] this is your next six months this is
[1:20:52] what's going to happen to you never
[1:20:54] never because of laws that way we
[1:20:56] wouldn't need faith right but God
[1:20:59] reveals himself to you and so whatever
[1:21:01] trouble you can go through you can walk
[1:21:03] through it
[1:21:04] irrespective of outcome amen
[1:21:11] that's not defeatist
[1:21:13] faith is unwavering remember the devil
[1:21:18] once just like jhope God nobody so the
[1:21:22] devil said to job the only reason he
[1:21:24] loves us because this is hitch and God
[1:21:27] proved him otherwise and it's the same
[1:21:29] thing with us you say your brights
[1:21:30] perfect there's done like on all the
[1:21:32] earth it's just because you've got the
[1:21:34] armies of heaven around her there's a
[1:21:35] wall of fire I mean that's you know and
[1:21:38] God says that I'll show you I showed you
[1:21:41] in the dark ages
[1:21:42] I'll show you today hell yeah and he
[1:21:47] does he puts us for he puts certain
[1:21:50] people forth as a example of overcoming
[1:21:52] power that's but our walks are all
[1:21:56] tailor-made I mean but Jobe wasn't on
[1:21:58] the ash heap because he was a secret
[1:21:59] sinner Jobe was on the ash heap because
[1:22:02] God was proving to Satan the power of
[1:22:03] the blood of the Lamb I mean anyone he
[1:22:06] shot to jove himself hallelujah see
[1:22:11] everything works for a good now so they
[1:22:15] were so so here was israel they're
[1:22:18] walking around jericho under expectation
[1:22:22] then finally they came the final circle
[1:22:25] of the wall and the priests blew the
[1:22:29] trumpet and the people when they heard
[1:22:32] the sound of the trumpet the people
[1:22:33] shouted with a great shout now a trumpet
[1:22:36] has to be fashioned a certain way to
[1:22:38] give a certain sound
[1:22:40] it can't be made every trumpet that the
[1:22:42] reason it gives a different sound it's
[1:22:44] because of shape different that may be
[1:22:46] very obvious but you know you take a big
[1:22:47] French on or a little whatever they have
[1:22:49] different shapes they they make a
[1:22:51] different sound
[1:22:52] now the gospel is your the gospel is the
[1:22:55] gospel trumpet that's the trumpet of
[1:22:57] jubilee it's got to be shaped in a
[1:22:59] certain way I'm in an order for the
[1:23:01] sound or the note to be made that's just
[1:23:03] right now it's the same thing with us
[1:23:05] remember we as believers you know we
[1:23:10] have to be shaped a certain way and all
[1:23:12] for the right sound to come out of our
[1:23:13] lips it means a God has to take us from
[1:23:16] the world and it's not the dimensions of
[1:23:18] your vocal cords I'm talking about I
[1:23:20] mean I'm talking about now when God
[1:23:21] takes you he justifies you sanctifies as
[1:23:24] you and fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] now you can make the right sound before
[1:23:28] that maybe you could sing the same songs
[1:23:30] everyone else and maybe sing a lot
[1:23:32] better than those who actually know the
[1:23:33] Lord but there comes a time when you
[1:23:35] meet them and it may sound the same but
[1:23:37] there's an anointing that travels now on
[1:23:39] your on your song or on your prayer I
[1:23:41] mean so it actually to God sounds
[1:23:43] different way because the trumpet has
[1:23:45] been has been shaped the right way now
[1:23:48] but in order for a trumpet to blow
[1:23:50] there's got to be a force got to be a
[1:23:51] breath that passes through the trumpet I
[1:23:54] mean so now we know the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:56] the breath of God he breathed on his
[1:23:58] disciples he said receive ye the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost so now they received a force they
[1:24:02] were impacted I mean by the life of God
[1:24:05] he's our breath went into them what is
[1:24:07] inspiration part of the definition of
[1:24:09] inspiration is actually like breathing
[1:24:11] in you receive something Allu you but so
[1:24:16] so now there has to be a force there's
[1:24:18] got to be a life go through the trumpet
[1:24:20] in order to make the sound this is the
[1:24:23] same thing with you and I the breath of
[1:24:24] God has to dwell in us that when we
[1:24:28] begin to praise God or we begin to say
[1:24:30] no God can do it again God's here he's
[1:24:34] in charge he'll take care of us he'll be
[1:24:36] our boss he'll supply our needs he'll
[1:24:39] fight our battles whatever thing we're
[1:24:41] facing right now he's in charge of it oh
[1:24:43] yeah hallelujah he's more than able I
[1:24:45] mean you began to confess that in God
[1:24:47] God here's a different kind of sound
[1:24:49] because he like you know he loves to see
[1:24:51] us confess this word
[1:24:53] he likes us to have a positive
[1:24:54] confession hello I'd like to see his
[1:24:57] children begin their fellowship and they
[1:24:59] let me say I've God's alive he's risen
[1:25:02] hallelujah he's cleanse me from all my
[1:25:05] sin I mean sure the devil's on my case
[1:25:07] but God's on my case Gaza I'm on the
[1:25:10] Lord's side
[1:25:11] hailer he's here to fight my battle my
[1:25:13] children are coming in my family's
[1:25:15] coming in particles are coming home
[1:25:16] Holly he likes to hear that kind of a
[1:25:18] confession that's why I always think
[1:25:21] positive always speak positive yeah you
[1:25:24] know the old saying if you've got
[1:25:25] nothing good to say say nothing at all
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:30] we should only speak good hallelujah so
[1:25:36] now God took a gospel trumpet God
[1:25:38] fashioned a trumpet in this hour he went
[1:25:41] through many trials until finally the
[1:25:43] sword landed in his hand and Sabino
[1:25:44] Canyon but now the trumpet was ready
[1:25:47] holier now there's a life came into that
[1:25:49] trumpet and a blue forth of Jubilee I
[1:25:51] mean that all who heard that sound of
[1:25:54] the gospel trumpet can go free so now
[1:25:57] this way the message came because it's
[1:25:59] the jubilee trumpet hallelujah a life
[1:26:02] force was pressing through it hallelujah
[1:26:07] but then when the people heard the sound
[1:26:09] of the trumpet the people shouted with a
[1:26:12] great shout hallelujah why is this
[1:26:16] shouting why is there noise what happens
[1:26:19] with noise you you just take the devil
[1:26:22] knows how this works that's why you see
[1:26:26] his entertainment people get excited
[1:26:28] they get relaxed first they begin to
[1:26:30] enjoy it they get into the spirit of it
[1:26:32] and then he can inject his doctrine his
[1:26:36] life into them people go to rock
[1:26:40] concerts they get caught up in the music
[1:26:41] whatever concert it is what they begin
[1:26:43] to enjoy it there's the lights the sound
[1:26:44] everything then the spirit that travels
[1:26:46] on that music comes upon the people
[1:26:49] because he knows how it works but
[1:26:52] remember he's just a pervert oh right so
[1:26:55] he takes what God does makes a perverted
[1:26:57] copy of it to achieve his own ends
[1:27:01] amen why do we have camps and different
[1:27:04] things in God yo everyone shouts and
[1:27:06] rejoices has a wonderful time
[1:27:07] it's what it shouldn't be just emotion
[1:27:09] it shouldn't just be excitement because
[1:27:11] other people are doing it and sure
[1:27:12] because God's moving on your soul to do
[1:27:14] it right but what happens in that kind
[1:27:16] of atmosphere we relax right we relax we
[1:27:20] begin to enjoy it we get into the spirit
[1:27:22] of the meeting and God can now work amen
[1:27:26] brother Brahim said about about iron
[1:27:27] that's like in order to shape iron
[1:27:29] you've got to heat it up first if you
[1:27:31] try and smash it with a with a with a
[1:27:33] blacksmith hammer you just shatter it
[1:27:35] but if you get it hot enough then you
[1:27:36] can shape it to what it needs to be is
[1:27:38] the same thing when the Spirit of God
[1:27:39] moves what's happening it's putting heat
[1:27:41] putting heat into the iron hell yeah so
[1:27:44] so we can be shaped into the image of
[1:27:46] his word I mean that's why we shouldn't
[1:27:49] come to that's why do you think you know
[1:27:51] from wherever you live so from there for
[1:27:53] me to hear it's all tense mind battles
[1:27:56] you know all these things what was that
[1:27:58] because the devil's trying to get me all
[1:28:00] tense that I can't enter into the
[1:28:02] service is it just me and then and then
[1:28:09] if we sit there with that mind battle we
[1:28:11] have Co and we sit through the service
[1:28:13] all that way what's happening and we're
[1:28:15] all quiet we just all this is going on
[1:28:16] in these people what's happening you
[1:28:18] could use a coal bit of iron but God
[1:28:20] wants you to come out of that thing
[1:28:22] that's why we have trouble but that's
[1:28:24] why we shout that's why we you raise our
[1:28:26] hand say Lord you're so lovely you're so
[1:28:28] good I'm so thankful in spite of me you
[1:28:30] called me you save me you redeem me
[1:28:32] hallelujah that's how we should be he
[1:28:38] say well you're a book Pentecostal the
[1:28:40] Pentecostal Church I was in before I
[1:28:41] came to the message they did not believe
[1:28:43] in raising their hands I was telling by
[1:28:47] the Andy who shocked about that that's
[1:28:49] true they did not believe in raising
[1:28:51] their hands they believe that wasn't
[1:28:52] right so you can imagine what kind of
[1:28:54] church it was Amen so it's not because I
[1:28:58] had seen it somewhere else I'm happy
[1:29:01] because I've been redeemed
[1:29:02] I shot because he's means everything to
[1:29:04] me I rejoiced because his word is true
[1:29:07] and I have more confidence in him now
[1:29:09] than I ever have
[1:29:11] I'm not looking for a means per minute
[1:29:13] or people on their feet no I am looking
[1:29:15] god is alive amen what birth cue was an
[1:29:19] atmosphere
[1:29:19] what burst here was an atmosphere bo-ram
[1:29:22] said you can take a hit
[1:29:23] chickens ed put under a pup the right
[1:29:25] temperature it'll hatch a chicken right
[1:29:27] - the same thing with an eagle you put
[1:29:29] an eagle egg and in the right atmosphere
[1:29:31] and Eagle will be birth that means the
[1:29:33] right atmosphere was needed for us to be
[1:29:35] born how much our children amen
[1:29:39] isn't that right that's why I say Lord
[1:29:42] come not just in church live in my house
[1:29:44] Civic sense atmosphere around us Lord
[1:29:46] you're alive Lord you're so wonderful
[1:29:49] Lord hallelujah that's how it should be
[1:29:52] shouldn't it an atmosphere at the right
[1:29:55] atmosphere will bring the right results
[1:29:57] holy remember we have the mechanics this
[1:30:00] we have the word but where the dynamics
[1:30:03] and the Holy Ghost
[1:30:04] they are coming together in this end
[1:30:06] time when brother and priests arising of
[1:30:08] the Sun they said you need both coming
[1:30:09] together amen amen
[1:30:14] that's why Europe I find it strange and
[1:30:17] a voice found this strange when people
[1:30:20] preach about miracles other people think
[1:30:22] well they're just not preaching opening
[1:30:24] of the word and then we're people preach
[1:30:26] the opening the word other people think
[1:30:28] well they're just not preaching the
[1:30:29] supernatural power of God for some
[1:30:32] reason it's always been that way this is
[1:30:33] what I found maybe they just might a lot
[1:30:35] yeah your observation people preach the
[1:30:37] power of God others look at us how they
[1:30:39] just don't know the third Paul well they
[1:30:41] just not preaching the opening of the
[1:30:42] word but the supernatural is in the
[1:30:45] opening of the word the supernatural is
[1:30:48] in the opening of the word I mean when
[1:30:50] David came to the throne the power of
[1:30:51] God was there I mean when the sword
[1:30:54] landed in the prophets hand I mean
[1:30:56] brother man see there's more things
[1:30:57] happening in the supernatural now I just
[1:30:59] don't have time to tell you about it
[1:31:00] under the opening of the word hallelujah
[1:31:03] so it's the Satan that's how it should
[1:31:05] be the angel of the Lord brother Branham
[1:31:08] says follows the message of the hour
[1:31:10] wherever the message the hours that
[1:31:11] Angel Lord is there to fulfill that
[1:31:13] message Amen - under the third pole is
[1:31:16] the opening of the word right it opens
[1:31:18] our eyes give us an understanding who we
[1:31:20] are amen who we are not who we shall be
[1:31:23] we already are we just step into that
[1:31:25] image right so these so the word came
[1:31:28] open
[1:31:28] you're the Bride of Christ when he
[1:31:30] preached invisible union I don't hear
[1:31:32] all him blasting all the people who are
[1:31:33] living in denomination I just hear him
[1:31:35] say you're sinless you're virtuous you
[1:31:38] never did in the first place you had a
[1:31:40] wedding band of unmerited premier
[1:31:42] predestinated grace on your finger
[1:31:44] parlor you already already had the
[1:31:46] wedding band hallelujah
[1:31:49] you already had it on you you's gonna
[1:31:50] come I just got to come over and say
[1:31:52] Lord this is what you've made me to be I
[1:31:55] mean when brother Roberts would would
[1:31:58] preach spurt slab Nisha and he talked
[1:32:00] about the soldier that was shell-shocked
[1:32:02] from the battle and he says part of
[1:32:03] amnesia actually you get amnesia by
[1:32:05] being between two opinions as the
[1:32:08] world's right as the word right is this
[1:32:11] message right or what you know people
[1:32:12] get between two opinions and they forget
[1:32:14] who they are he's saying about thee
[1:32:16] about the soldiers they were on their
[1:32:18] way to a mental institution wherever
[1:32:21] they call it and they were being being
[1:32:23] being a transported by rail and and the
[1:32:26] and the soldiers that had to Ebenezer
[1:32:28] they they got out of the railway
[1:32:30] carriage and the guards were watching
[1:32:31] them and one one of them begin to start
[1:32:33] looking around this is more than a story
[1:32:36] I was on my way to a mental institution
[1:32:40] didn't know who I was don't know where
[1:32:43] I'm going to know where I'm from but
[1:32:45] ever get to look around but they're not
[1:32:47] begin to look around and I'm gonna see
[1:32:50] familiar places something in me
[1:32:51] identified I am Ruth I am Easter I am
[1:32:57] right here hallelujah I am David I'm his
[1:33:01] mighty men I can see myself as Peter
[1:33:04] James and John I can see myself as John
[1:33:06] on the Isle of Patmos I can see myself
[1:33:08] in the New Jerusalem holy and what
[1:33:10] happened the amnesia begins to break and
[1:33:13] then now the one who wrote the book
[1:33:16] comes out just like the father the
[1:33:19] soldier with the amnesia he begins to
[1:33:20] walk the guard say just just let him
[1:33:22] walk just let him walk that's why young
[1:33:24] people begin walking through the
[1:33:25] scripture
[1:33:26] just let them walk walk through the
[1:33:29] message you'll find who you are
[1:33:30] hallelujah he begins to walk and they
[1:33:32] follow me finally he comes to a house
[1:33:34] and then old man comes out the ports and
[1:33:36] then gives a big hug his son I knew
[1:33:39] you'd come home hallelujah and his
[1:33:41] amnesia broken show this is who I am I
[1:33:44] mean the shellshock was gone
[1:33:47] hallelujah it's gonna be the same way
[1:33:49] with you and I Wow I'm beginning to see
[1:33:51] myself in the word that he stepped forth
[1:33:53] I knew you'd come home saying hallelujah
[1:33:57] now I'm beginning to see who I was
[1:34:00] hallelujah to God
[1:34:02] don't let the stigma of your past hold
[1:34:05] you back
[1:34:07] hallelujah ain't gonna set this off I
[1:34:10] was once shell-shocked the father and
[1:34:12] kid the amnesia brought your home
[1:34:14] hallelujah and that's why this word
[1:34:16] should be such something to you
[1:34:17] it just sounds like home to me
[1:34:20] hallelujah
[1:34:21] in spite of my past in spite of whatever
[1:34:24] stigma it feels like home hallelujah and
[1:34:30] the reason it feels like home is because
[1:34:32] it is home and God through it is calling
[1:34:35] you home never ever forget it well we
[1:34:40] got trials and troubles in life now I've
[1:34:42] been called I didn't call myself no one
[1:34:45] else call me God called me God found me
[1:34:48] he say but your parents were believers
[1:34:50] another one day and they weren't at that
[1:34:52] time but one day God found me
[1:34:55] hallelujah remember it's your walk it's
[1:34:58] your walk with God it's not someone
[1:35:00] else's walk he said well I've just
[1:35:03] started walking keep stepping I keep
[1:35:07] falling over just like when the girl
[1:35:08] started to learn to walk they didn't
[1:35:10] just get up one day and start running
[1:35:11] along and skipping they held onto things
[1:35:14] they'll walk here long and what I do go
[1:35:16] we're encouraging them daddy's proud of
[1:35:19] you you can do it you can do it and in
[1:35:22] their legs begin to muscles begin to
[1:35:24] grow they really had stronger bouncing
[1:35:25] than that then they would let go that
[1:35:27] launched out into space or mostly oh hi
[1:35:30] Ben they are really going they fell over
[1:35:32] more when they launched out without
[1:35:34] holding onto things and sometimes we've
[1:35:36] got to hold onto the framework of the
[1:35:37] church right people hold onto a certain
[1:35:40] thing
[1:35:40] but then you're gonna let go and you
[1:35:42] just got to walk with God hold on to
[1:35:44] that unseen hand but then eventually you
[1:35:47] go from falling over then you're up when
[1:35:50] a child learns to walk and they fall
[1:35:52] over do you ever see a parent in their
[1:35:53] right mind berating them you're useless
[1:35:56] you what are you give you know you never
[1:36:00] ever see that do you think God beats us
[1:36:03] because we fall down does it deal you
[1:36:06] know older siblings I'll just kind of
[1:36:07] put their foot out you know not that the
[1:36:10] devil's out older sibling video I don't
[1:36:11] mean you know the deal all triples up
[1:36:12] sometimes you know the first thing we
[1:36:14] know childhoods himself what appearance
[1:36:16] do pick them up in your cake is
[1:36:17] everything fine calms them down that's
[1:36:19] okay
[1:36:19] you know let them go on their way that's
[1:36:21] what the Lord wants to do with us but I
[1:36:24] fell daddy don't worry about the stigma
[1:36:25] of falling it doesn't matter
[1:36:28] get up you're fine catch you up whatever
[1:36:32] you need just walk on continued on let's
[1:36:36] hatch that's what God wants with us he
[1:36:38] never ever ever holds our past against
[1:36:40] us never he never purchased our
[1:36:44] salvation just to hold it and though
[1:36:46] well if they get naughty enough I'm
[1:36:47] gonna bring this out that's not how he
[1:36:50] works he took care of it remember he
[1:36:53] took all of your sin in your shame he
[1:36:56] says I'm gonna take care of this I'm
[1:36:58] gonna carry it up Calvary I'm gonna take
[1:37:00] it down to hell for you that you don't
[1:37:03] need to carry it I'll take that stigma
[1:37:05] give it to me I'll take care of it
[1:37:08] hallelujah that's how he is and then
[1:37:12] when we come back to then we're walking
[1:37:14] with this condemnation man I wish I
[1:37:15] could Y myself why am I still a son of
[1:37:18] Korah my father did this boy right yeah
[1:37:21] I did this and God looks this is I don't
[1:37:24] remember that why are you carrying that
[1:37:27] why are you carrying your past I don't
[1:37:29] remember your past the past the only
[1:37:33] past I remember of you is when you're
[1:37:35] shouting and rejoicing before the
[1:37:36] foundation of the world that's what I
[1:37:38] remember I remember
[1:37:39] that's eternal there's no time right so
[1:37:42] what you were then you'll be there
[1:37:45] hallelujah says's that's all I remember
[1:37:47] of you and that's what you're going to
[1:37:49] be
[1:37:50] so don't carry we wrestle with our
[1:37:53] humanity I'm glad people said yep
[1:37:56] because hey baby it's just me but God
[1:37:59] made you a certain way God gave you your
[1:38:01] personality he didn't want us all to be
[1:38:03] like God is not a cookie cutter right he
[1:38:07] said well I he said well I don't want to
[1:38:10] be so emotional God made you emotional
[1:38:14] you know God made you how you we got to
[1:38:16] be comfortable in our own skin I
[1:38:19] remember singing in what Bible four
[1:38:21] schools are promised y'all thank you
[1:38:22] Father for making me me and when you let
[1:38:26] say you're just singing it you don't
[1:38:28] really assign when you get to a certain
[1:38:30] age and you see the flaws in your
[1:38:32] character it's a bit harder to sing but
[1:38:35] God made you you for a reason and we
[1:38:39] have to come to peace with that Lord you
[1:38:41] made me with my personality for a reason
[1:38:44] amen hello Lou young so they blew the
[1:38:51] trumpets they shouted hallelujah and the
[1:38:56] more the walls came down I believe the
[1:38:57] more they shouted why go so begin to
[1:39:00] crumble and it fell down Flint
[1:39:02] hallelujah and it should be the same
[1:39:04] thing with us amen underneath go from
[1:39:08] expectation to rejoicing hallelujah amen
[1:39:14] we're on our way home friends we're on
[1:39:18] our way home this is this is Nick's
[1:39:20] toppers home next stop is heaven
[1:39:23] remember think of everything that the
[1:39:26] Lord has ever done for you
[1:39:28] amen if he did all that imagine them
[1:39:31] going around Jericho they wouldn't let
[1:39:33] maybe when they went back to camp
[1:39:35] they'd have testimony meeting anymore
[1:39:37] it's like when the Death Angel came so
[1:39:39] Joshua and Caleb were there let's say no
[1:39:41] you know they put the blood on the door
[1:39:43] and lentil there's great screams that
[1:39:44] night but there's no screaming our
[1:39:47] houses because the blood was applied we
[1:39:49] were safe we can lead off the pressure
[1:39:51] and then that there then in the next
[1:39:54] morning whether it was we walked out of
[1:39:55] Egypt Caleb you remember what that was
[1:39:57] like I'm so great hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:00] we're walking free and they went to the
[1:40:03] Red Sea
[1:40:03] oh my we were there there's great
[1:40:06] distress among the people but Moses said
[1:40:09] these Egyptians that you see you won't
[1:40:13] see them again and they were there the
[1:40:15] pillar fire was behind us Kipnis as a
[1:40:17] buffer between us Aryan to me and then
[1:40:19] he lifted his stuff in the red sea
[1:40:21] opened I never seen the heaven before my
[1:40:23] life and then we walked over dry land
[1:40:27] wholly dry land and we got to the other
[1:40:30] side
[1:40:30] I'm just we talk about what God has
[1:40:33] always done you gotta have a testimony
[1:40:35] service the same God that meant their
[1:40:37] misfit you may be different dispensation
[1:40:40] but the same God there is the same God
[1:40:41] here and then so they walked across dry
[1:40:43] land and then now we saw the Egyptians
[1:40:46] coming after us
[1:40:47] then Moses lifted his staff and the sea
[1:40:50] came back over hallelujah and then we
[1:40:54] realized our enemy was dead I mean an 80
[1:40:57] something-year-old woman lifted up a
[1:40:59] tambourine and she began to rejoice
[1:41:01] maryam was not a young Chuck young
[1:41:04] sister she was all that she lived in my
[1:41:06] worship imagine a million people
[1:41:08] shouting and praising God holy on the
[1:41:10] roof yeah you're on the seed bank
[1:41:12] because their enemy wants the admission
[1:41:13] there
[1:41:14] hallelujah and then we came to the
[1:41:16] waters of Mara it was bitter but Moses
[1:41:19] found a tree is inspired he cut it down
[1:41:21] it became sweet so sure there was a
[1:41:23] bitter part in our walk but but the
[1:41:25] cross she put it in with the cross that
[1:41:26] became a sweet experience then we walked
[1:41:28] on a bit more and God fed us out of the
[1:41:30] heavens and God came down on Sinai what
[1:41:33] a precious air was you remember Joshua
[1:41:36] Oh my pitcher
[1:41:37] Caleb then we went into the land I might
[1:41:40] be skipping a few things remember
[1:41:41] testimony you think what is God done for
[1:41:44] you there's a reason
[1:41:46] Caleb why did he do that first we got
[1:41:48] inheritance remember Caleb going over
[1:41:50] looking at that mountain and you said I
[1:41:52] want that one hell yeah
[1:41:54] have you ever gone to a store you can
[1:41:55] buy whatever you want I haven't but
[1:41:57] that'd be cool right that was like that
[1:41:59] going to the land remember they're
[1:42:00] looking there's an inspiration coming
[1:42:02] upon them they're identifying themselves
[1:42:04] with the part of the land that stairs so
[1:42:07] there's now a burden on Caleb saying
[1:42:09] that's mine and then he comes back and
[1:42:12] they come back with the grapes and all
[1:42:13] those things and Caleb says I'm seeing
[1:42:16] where I'm living
[1:42:17] it's a mountain and he begins to tell
[1:42:20] his children about it
[1:42:21] they began have fellowship day after day
[1:42:23] after day and the promise just gets
[1:42:25] greater and greater and greater why is
[1:42:27] it getting greater because God told
[1:42:29] Moses for one year for every day that
[1:42:32] the spicer shout the land you'll be in
[1:42:34] the you'll be in the world and so forty
[1:42:35] years
[1:42:36] so after year number one Caleb says
[1:42:38] children 39 years to go next year 38 I'm
[1:42:43] not gonna go all the way down to zero
[1:42:45] but you know what I mean and the
[1:42:46] expectation would have got greater and
[1:42:49] greater because the promise was getting
[1:42:51] more real and more real and more real
[1:42:54] and it's the same thing with this
[1:42:55] rapture it's getting more real and it's
[1:42:58] getting closer and got to getting us
[1:43:00] ready and we going to leave this world
[1:43:02] probably the expectation yeah me pills
[1:43:05] are it's been years
[1:43:06] hallelujah it's been years we're close I
[1:43:10] remember on our way and the expectation
[1:43:13] gets greater why because the Lord's
[1:43:15] getting us in condition it's not us
[1:43:18] getting ourselves in condition I mean
[1:43:20] what haven't win/win/win brother Bram
[1:43:22] you know he saw he saw the preview of
[1:43:25] the bride and those ones that were in
[1:43:27] European garments they were they were
[1:43:29] walking off the trail cuz they were
[1:43:30] looking at the wrong thing but he cried
[1:43:32] out stay in line why because their focus
[1:43:35] was coming off what they should have
[1:43:37] been following right and it's got to be
[1:43:39] the same thing with us we're being led
[1:43:41] by the pillar of fire I mean this
[1:43:43] message I mean this is a pillar of fire
[1:43:45] leading us right but if we keep our take
[1:43:47] our eyes off and look at other stuff we
[1:43:50] get out of step and that's even if you
[1:43:54] look at yourself you get out of step
[1:43:56] because I've got this problem this is
[1:43:58] going on do it a little sure all those
[1:44:00] things may be there but look at him
[1:44:02] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:44:04] finisher not looking unto yourself amen
[1:44:08] and then now finally here we came Caleb
[1:44:16] yes Joshua hellooo yeah we're going into
[1:44:20] the land now and Caleb's 84 years old no
[1:44:25] doubt he would relate those testimonies
[1:44:27] over and over and over again
[1:44:28] and here tell us children
[1:44:30] God told me I'm gonna take this mountain
[1:44:32] God told me it wasn't even my desire God
[1:44:35] came and said you know your desire here
[1:44:37] for that mountain you have that that
[1:44:39] burden you have for that mountain that's
[1:44:41] yours
[1:44:41] and then he was only four years old then
[1:44:43] he comes to Joshua Joshua he begins to
[1:44:46] testify to him I wasn't like the other
[1:44:48] spies we believe that selves
[1:44:50] I've been fighting all these years now
[1:44:52] give me my Mountain and an 84 year old
[1:44:55] man hallelujah Joshua said that's yours
[1:45:01] you can take that now oh yeah there he
[1:45:04] goes
[1:45:05] anything that's what he got that
[1:45:07] mountain cause he kept that promise in
[1:45:09] front of him it's mine and here's under
[1:45:12] expectation it's mine I mean the stigma
[1:45:16] of the wilderness was gone how about
[1:45:21] your stigma I'm gonna leave it there
[1:45:24] Jesus is taking care of it you see I
[1:45:27] came from a terrible background that
[1:45:29] don't matter that's irrelevant don't
[1:45:33] ever let it hold you back I'm going
[1:45:35] through big things don't worry about it
