[53:01] could you just bring that up on
[53:03] to the screen here Romans 16:
[53:13] 25-26 it's not on my slide it's just a
[53:15] scripture I want to read before I
[53:17] start it says now to him that
[53:21] is of power to establish you according
[53:24] to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus
[53:28] Christ according to the revelation of
[53:29] the mystery which was Kept Secret since
[53:31] the world began but now is made manifest
[53:34] by the scriptures of the prophets
[53:36] according to the Commandments of the
[53:38] Everlasting God made known to All
[53:40] Nations for The Obedience of faith and
[53:43] the last verse to God only wise be glory
[53:46] through Jesus Christ forever amen am
[53:49] amen may God bless his word you can take
[53:50] your seats this
[53:52] morning amen good morning
[53:57] how are you all doing
[53:59] good I'm doing
[54:02] good this is like catching up with old
[54:05] friends you
[54:06] know having a nice
[54:09] conversation you know when you when you
[54:11] come up here it's it's not like you
[54:14] don't want to just get into it but you
[54:16] kind of just got to catch the atmosphere
[54:18] for a while and just see where the
[54:19] spirit is and just kind of settle in
[54:21] maybe it's a human thing but there's a
[54:23] you know there's an atmosphere in places
[54:25] and there's a there's a connection in
[54:28] spiritual Realms there just things that
[54:30] that are happening you know and we we
[54:32] walk and think that we're natural beings
[54:34] but we're actually supernatural beings
[54:36] we're Spiritual Beings you know you're
[54:37] all very Spiritual Beings this morning
[54:39] so so we try and just just get into that
[54:42] atmosphere this morning not like just a
[54:44] natural atmosphere where we talk about
[54:47] the weather we talk about this and that
[54:48] and the other thing we actually want to
[54:50] get into a spiritual atmosphere and just
[54:51] catch thank each other's spirits and I
[54:54] think you all have warm Spirits like you
[54:56] know when people would come into the
[54:58] prayer line with brother brandom he
[54:59] would say you're a Christian I sense a
[55:01] warm Spirit about you yeah and we all
[55:05] have warm Spirits I believe this morning
[55:07] so there's there's an atmosphere
[55:09] here and and and sometimes you know it's
[55:13] interesting the things that you
[55:14] sometimes if you come up and
[55:16] speak at the ppit it's interesting the
[55:19] things that you say
[55:20] sometimes because there's an there's an
[55:22] anointing here and often times I think I
[55:24] wonder if I'm thinking the right thing
[55:25] and I I think I I when I'll try and say
[55:27] it when I'm up there and see if it comes
[55:28] out and if generally if it comes out
[55:31] it's usually if you're led by the spirit
[55:32] of God it's the it's the right thing you
[55:35] know we're not always perfectly correct
[55:36] in everything we do but you know some of
[55:38] the things that get set up here are
[55:39] actually super they're more than
[55:41] Supernatural and there's prophecies and
[55:42] there's things that speak directly like
[55:45] when I think we spoke about I think it
[55:47] was Deborah one time you I saw a saw a
[55:50] name it just something was that
[55:52] happening at that moment you know the
[55:53] name was spoken I don't know if Deb
[55:54] remember members us too she was playing
[55:56] the the piano one time and we we um
[56:00] after service we called up brother Ian
[56:01] hmer to pray he was here for that
[56:04] weekend and Midway through his prayer
[56:07] Deborah started playing the steadfast
[56:09] love of the Lord never ceases she was
[56:11] playing one song then she stopped and
[56:12] went to the other song and I think
[56:15] brother Ian maybe passed away two months
[56:18] after that or something um but you know
[56:21] that was for Years the song I had for
[56:23] brother I was that song the steadfast
[56:25] love of the Lord never ceases it was and
[56:28] I think I told him one time this is the
[56:29] song for you his Mercy's never coming to
[56:32] an end and you know just there was an
[56:33] atmosphere when it started to be played
[56:35] on the piano as he was praying she knew
[56:36] nothing of the song and that and I think
[56:38] a few weeks ago there's something for
[56:39] brother Ben you know scripture was
[56:41] spoken and there something just said
[56:43] that's for brother Ben Bailey you know
[56:45] and then it you just so that's the God
[56:47] we serve he's a supernatural God this
[56:49] morning amen I feel a good
[56:52] atmosphere amen um so
[56:55] the I had another idea that I was going
[56:58] to speak about that I've been working on
[56:59] for a while and it it wasn't really
[57:01] working for this one so the um the the
[57:04] thought that I had this morning was a
[57:07] secret a secret and I couldn't get away
[57:10] from this thought and often when you you
[57:12] know when you start getting it
[57:14] together I I I look into it and I think
[57:17] man I could I'm not going to get five
[57:18] minutes out of this
[57:20] thought you know and then and then as
[57:23] you're going on and just looking into
[57:25] the different things about it you think
[57:26] man I don't know how I'm going to
[57:27] squeeze this in to to about 55 minutes
[57:31] or an hour you know and and it's turned
[57:33] out I've just got to skim across it now
[57:35] there's there's there's a lot in it
[57:38] wonderful but the idea is a secret do
[57:40] you children know what a secret is you
[57:42] know what a secret is it's one of those
[57:44] things that you say to your friend this
[57:45] is a secret I'll tell you but don't tell
[57:47] anyone else hey and then that person
[57:51] says to someone else I got a secret I'll
[57:53] tell you but don't tell anyone else and
[57:54] they're just just goes around
[57:56] yes yeah it's not really a secet it was
[57:59] never a secret to begin with cuz you
[58:00] just say don't tell anyone else but I'll
[58:02] tell you the secret and they just tell
[58:03] other people that same
[58:06] thing that's true but there are
[58:09] secrets
[58:12] hallelu and the secret of something that
[58:14] is not known or seen or not meant to be
[58:16] known or seen can I just drop something
[58:18] else in there ton is good to see you
[58:21] here when I
[58:23] was when I was
[58:25] uh you know we had the church in giz and
[58:27] then we came here and there were three
[58:28] people I told Sister Louise the other
[58:30] day there were three people that
[58:32] something about those three people just
[58:34] did something in here and I thought they
[58:36] were very good people and I always had a
[58:38] special little place for them one was um
[58:40] Sharon Marriott one was Louise Maloney
[58:44] and one was
[58:47] tonyan and I said to Louise the other
[58:50] day I I just pointed out hey look two of
[58:53] you are here now
[58:58] and and um the funny thing is that the
[59:00] ppit that was there is this one
[59:04] here I thought I'll say that up under
[59:06] the anointing and see if it comes
[59:08] out came
[59:10] out
[59:13] okay so now back to our thought God that
[59:16] of the secret now the things of God
[59:18] God's a secret he's actually a secret
[59:20] although you can see him everywhere if
[59:22] you look he's actually God is actually
[59:27] in reality God is a
[59:33] secret
[59:47] work
[59:53] okay
[1:00:03] you know what I'll try this
[1:00:10] one
[1:00:12] secret secret secret
[1:00:16] yeah maybe I disconnect that one and not
[1:00:19] try this
[1:00:22] one try this click oh
[1:00:28] man Back to Basics okay I just need to
[1:00:32] read it off here though that's the thing
[1:00:34] okay all right it is no secret what God
[1:00:37] can
[1:00:40] do so now God Jesus when he was here
[1:00:44] speaking about God being a
[1:00:46] secret even though he spoke openly the
[1:00:48] things he were talking about were
[1:00:50] actually a secret you couldn't just
[1:00:52] catch them they were there's something
[1:00:53] inside that that was a secret you know
[1:00:56] and he said um Jesus it says at that
[1:00:59] time Jesus answered and said I thank
[1:01:01] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:01:03] because thou has hid these things from
[1:01:05] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[1:01:07] them unto babes he's saying so he's got
[1:01:09] this ability to he keeps these things as
[1:01:11] secret to certain people then he reveals
[1:01:13] it to other people that's the way that
[1:01:16] this word is and that's the way that God
[1:01:17] operates he's a lot of the things that
[1:01:20] there are secret another time he said
[1:01:22] blessed art thou Simon Jonah for flesh
[1:01:25] and blood has not revealed this secret
[1:01:27] to you but my Father which is in heaven
[1:01:30] he said God's decided to show you this
[1:01:32] little secret it was his and and he
[1:01:34] thought I'll tell Peter who I am Peter
[1:01:38] I'm the Son of God now and Peter heard
[1:01:41] the secret
[1:01:42] somehow okay but that's the way that God
[1:01:45] operates and here he says that seeing
[1:01:48] they may see and not
[1:01:51] perceive and hearing they may hear and
[1:01:53] not understand understand cuz they
[1:01:55] weren't actually told the secret
[1:01:56] although they heard it they didn't
[1:01:57] actually hear the secret lest at any
[1:02:00] time they should be converted by hearing
[1:02:02] this little secret of God well big
[1:02:04] secret of God and their sins should be
[1:02:11] forgiven here he says no man can come to
[1:02:13] me except the Father which has sent me
[1:02:16] draw him that's right and I'll raise him
[1:02:18] up at the last day so saying you can't
[1:02:20] really even go to God unless God Reveals
[1:02:22] His little secret and something in your
[1:02:23] heart decides that you want God but
[1:02:26] that's just God revealing his secret to
[1:02:30] you I've got a lot to get through so I'm
[1:02:32] going to go reasonably fast but we
[1:02:34] understand that faith in itself then is
[1:02:35] a secret it it this this concept of
[1:02:38] Faith it's not just something you can
[1:02:39] just wake up in the morning and I just
[1:02:40] want to have faith it's the the ability
[1:02:43] to have faith is actually a revelation
[1:02:45] it's God revealing something to you and
[1:02:47] then you something in you goes yes I
[1:02:49] believe that and then you walk towards
[1:02:51] whatever that thing was that you heard
[1:02:53] right right that's that's how it works
[1:02:55] you don't you it doesn't work the other
[1:02:56] way around where you suddenly decide I'm
[1:02:58] going to believe something it's God has
[1:03:01] to reveal to you something first maybe
[1:03:04] it might be you're a sinner am I I am
[1:03:09] yes okay there must be a solution for
[1:03:11] this problem I have then and Faith
[1:03:13] starts to try and find a solution to
[1:03:15] that secret that God's revealed but if
[1:03:16] that was never shown to them as a TR as
[1:03:19] a revelation they wouldn't you wouldn't
[1:03:21] we wouldn't act on it see so faith in
[1:03:23] itself is actually a revelation you you
[1:03:25] have to get revealed something to have
[1:03:26] faith in it that's how it works he says
[1:03:30] what is it he's talking about faith
[1:03:31] that's a revelation what is faith is God
[1:03:33] by the spirit Spirit revealing to you
[1:03:35] something he's going to do or he's
[1:03:37] promised then that's the church that God
[1:03:40] built upon the rock that the gates of
[1:03:42] hell can't Prevail against it so that's
[1:03:44] God's true means of operating is
[1:03:46] actually by showing you the secret of
[1:03:48] himself and that's that's the gospel
[1:03:50] that's Christianity it's not a natural
[1:03:52] thing where we hear it go yeah I believe
[1:03:55] I I I think I understand that and we
[1:03:57] just carry on acting in in our own minds
[1:03:59] it's actually a there's an element to it
[1:04:01] that is
[1:04:02] Supernatural That's either there or it's
[1:04:04] not that's how this gospel works now
[1:04:08] brother BR talks about Abel and he says
[1:04:09] and Abel rolled him up a rock and made
[1:04:12] him a church or worship place but when
[1:04:15] Abel came here by faith he said Faith
[1:04:17] isn't something that's an imaginary
[1:04:19] thing I want you to get it faith is a
[1:04:20] direct Revelation am see if you only
[1:04:23] accept Christ you say if you're by an
[1:04:25] intellectual you haven't got it yet you
[1:04:26] cannot say that Jesus is the Christ
[1:04:28] until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to
[1:04:30] you see the intellectual Faith oh if I
[1:04:33] could only get that one point right now
[1:04:35] to go down home in every heart I'm
[1:04:37] thankful for this place possession right
[1:04:39] now see if you can only see this you'll
[1:04:42] see the greatest thing you've seen in
[1:04:43] years you want to see the greatest thing
[1:04:45] you've seen in years you're seeing
[1:04:48] it look not because I'm standing here
[1:04:50] saying it but if you can understand how
[1:04:52] it is that faith is not something
[1:04:54] mentally perceived but it is a
[1:04:56] revelation a revelation of God by faith
[1:04:59] not intellectual but by his heart he's
[1:05:01] saying it's God showing his secret right
[1:05:05] now this is just a little picture it's
[1:05:07] quite an extreme
[1:05:08] picture but yet this is the first
[1:05:10] example of a an intellectual perception
[1:05:13] of God and actually God revealing a
[1:05:17] secret that they another way and this is
[1:05:20] a perfect example of the
[1:05:21] two operating because
[1:05:24] Cain just thought okay God's a good god
[1:05:27] yes he made us and I grew this fruit and
[1:05:28] I'll just offer it to God and they were
[1:05:30] both worshiping God but they both the
[1:05:33] their modes of operation were very
[1:05:34] different their approach to God was
[1:05:36] different because one was based on I
[1:05:38] think this is a good idea and I I want
[1:05:40] to worship God this way another one had
[1:05:42] this Revelation and he worshiped a
[1:05:44] different way so so this now played out
[1:05:47] in our real life you know and and this
[1:05:51] has what we contend with on a daily
[1:05:53] basis in the Christian world is this
[1:05:55] sort of stuff here right it's it's not a
[1:05:56] hard thing to understand it's just this
[1:05:58] is just how it works you know so it just
[1:06:02] carries on and on and on so the the same
[1:06:04] the same attitude that Cain had towards
[1:06:06] Abel and Cain had towards God it was me
[1:06:10] when Jesus was here on Earth he met the
[1:06:12] same attitude of these intellectual
[1:06:14] people thinking they knew God worshiping
[1:06:17] the very God that they say they worship
[1:06:19] yeah that's how far intellectual Faith
[1:06:22] could get them they killed the very
[1:06:25] person they say they
[1:06:26] worship that shows you how far off that
[1:06:29] that we cannot perceive god without God
[1:06:31] revealing to us the secret and and when
[1:06:33] you carry on you get to this sort of
[1:06:35] predicament where your perception of God
[1:06:38] this one on the here the perception of
[1:06:42] God is and an intellectual Faith would
[1:06:43] be when I get there I'm going to see a
[1:06:45] father on the throne then I'm going to
[1:06:46] see a son Jesus sitting next to him then
[1:06:49] I'm going to I'm going to see a holy
[1:06:50] spirit flying around that was where the
[1:06:54] natural perception would take
[1:06:57] us but but when we are sh on the secret
[1:07:00] we realize that no I'm actually only
[1:07:02] going to see one being which is the
[1:07:04] image of the invisible God which is
[1:07:06] Christ that's who I'm that's who's going
[1:07:08] to be there so we end up in two
[1:07:11] different places based on our
[1:07:12] intellectual perception or the
[1:07:14] Revelation that's why you know Peter was
[1:07:18] said the
[1:07:19] Revelation uh be baptized in the name of
[1:07:21] Jesus Christ because he knew this is
[1:07:23] that was the name of the father son Holy
[1:07:24] Ghost so that was that was God revealing
[1:07:27] his secrets to Peter and not everyone
[1:07:30] else that goes down that road they've
[1:07:32] just thought about it and thought this
[1:07:34] could be correct
[1:07:35] right I like when brother um Bean said
[1:07:39] when he you know when we try and maybe
[1:07:40] find a new song to sing if we we we we
[1:07:42] look up and send a link to it and it
[1:07:46] sort of looks like this you know some
[1:07:47] sort
[1:07:48] of like a rock concert sort of set up
[1:07:52] and one day he said you know it's like
[1:07:54] offering you know and and it's true and
[1:07:57] I thought that was a good example
[1:07:58] because you look in the beginning when
[1:08:00] Cain came he had this perception of who
[1:08:01] God was and he just offered this nice
[1:08:03] beautiful thing but Abel offered the
[1:08:08] lamb he killed this lamb and the lamb
[1:08:09] bleeded and he offered he offered that
[1:08:11] because he knew by Revelation life has
[1:08:13] to die in order for me to live and it
[1:08:15] was a messy thing it was a gruesome
[1:08:17] thing it was It was kind of weird you
[1:08:19] know it was all Kane Kane's little
[1:08:21] church service over there was was a lot
[1:08:23] Morey than H sorry Abel's church service
[1:08:25] over there was a lot more messier than
[1:08:27] kan's one was you know kan's was well
[1:08:29] polished his fruit was maybe grown
[1:08:30] really nice but but you get the scenario
[1:08:33] here where you get a contrast and one
[1:08:36] has just an intellectual understanding
[1:08:38] of another one is the secrets of God
[1:08:41] have
[1:08:42] been showing to people so that they can
[1:08:45] actually approach God the right way amen
[1:08:47] now if brother BR says here I've got a
[1:08:49] lot of quotes is that right
[1:08:51] okay now I think thanks
[1:08:54] bro now you know me that I only have a
[1:08:57] grammar school education I know nothing
[1:08:59] of psychology I know nothing about
[1:09:00] Medics I know nothing about the
[1:09:02] anatomy I only thing I know I love the
[1:09:06] Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart
[1:09:07] that's all I know I'm uneducated
[1:09:09] illiterate and I have no abilities of my
[1:09:11] own not even a normal personality that's
[1:09:13] right but I know one thing and I'm
[1:09:15] thankful for that I know how to submit
[1:09:17] myself that Jesus Christ can work
[1:09:20] through me that's he said I'd rather
[1:09:22] have that than all your educ that there
[1:09:24] is in the world up here I'd rather know
[1:09:26] how to submit myself to the spirit of
[1:09:29] God and say Lord here I am I'd rather
[1:09:31] have that secret in my heart than have
[1:09:34] the secret of every hydrogen and atomic
[1:09:36] bomb in the world or could be made for
[1:09:38] it's more powerful than all the atomic
[1:09:40] bombs that could be thought of so under
[1:09:42] his Everlasting wings I take my refuge
[1:09:44] tonight so saying of the two options if
[1:09:47] I could have all this information here
[1:09:48] or just God revealing a secret to me
[1:09:50] that I could submit to him here I'd
[1:09:52] rather take that yeah okay and that's
[1:09:54] the road that we go down is we want the
[1:09:56] secrets of God to be revealed to us now
[1:09:59] that then that then brings us to this
[1:10:01] place when when God starts to reveal
[1:10:03] himself to us that gets us to this place
[1:10:04] called the secret place CU then then
[1:10:07] there is this because there's a secret
[1:10:09] God that's revealing Secrets there's
[1:10:10] then a secret place that you can go to
[1:10:12] to have communion you all know what I'm
[1:10:15] talking about the secret place you know
[1:10:16] it's just that it's that secret place
[1:10:18] with God and he said
[1:10:22] and and brother Brown said say brother
[1:10:24] sister there is a secret place that
[1:10:25] every belie believer should go the
[1:10:28] backside of the desert there in those
[1:10:29] sacred Sands oh no doctor of theology no
[1:10:32] Greek or Hebrew scholar no school or
[1:10:34] seminary that might twist you all up in
[1:10:36] these kind of things but if you ever met
[1:10:39] God on those sacred sand Satan can't put
[1:10:41] his feet on them Sands you know you met
[1:10:45] God something real what was it you talk
[1:10:47] to God yourself you had an experience
[1:10:48] you went into that secret place with God
[1:10:50] where Satan can't go there amen he can
[1:10:52] go in this place he he he dwells in this
[1:10:54] other place and all these rock concerts
[1:10:56] and stuff like that that's where he
[1:10:57] dwells but he doesn't dwell in the
[1:10:58] secret place but listen to a still Small
[1:11:02] Voice every one of you people who
[1:11:04] profess to be Christians don't uh get
[1:11:06] yourself quiet before him don't let the
[1:11:07] washing
[1:11:09] hinder don't let the work hinder don't
[1:11:11] let nothing hinder don't let nobody know
[1:11:13] what you are doing just go before him
[1:11:15] get up in the woods somewhere get out on
[1:11:17] the side of the road go into the secret
[1:11:19] closet and close the door when the kids
[1:11:21] get at school they get down on your knee
[1:11:24] hallu you've heard all kinds of voices
[1:11:27] everywhere more so on this day but just
[1:11:30] get down and stay there until those
[1:11:32] voices are silenced and you begin to
[1:11:34] lift up it'll change you it'll make you
[1:11:36] different like it did to this little
[1:11:38] Samuel it'll do something to you if
[1:11:40] you'll just do it now it'll make you
[1:11:42] what you should be it'll make you the
[1:11:44] kind of Christian that you ought to be
[1:11:47] right so that's the secret to living an
[1:11:49] overcoming Christian life is to get in
[1:11:50] the secret place and let God reveal his
[1:11:52] secrets to you and it just changes you
[1:11:55] now it's hard to explain it's kind of
[1:11:56] not really explainable just like he said
[1:11:59] there's a piece that passes all
[1:12:00] understanding you can't tell them tell
[1:12:02] people this is how the peace works and
[1:12:04] I'll work it out for you because it
[1:12:05] doesn't it's not intellectually
[1:12:07] understandable And yet when we get in
[1:12:09] that secret place with God we just have
[1:12:10] some sort of peace from somewhere
[1:12:11] somehow you don't have to explain it but
[1:12:14] it happens brother B says did you ever
[1:12:17] walk out in the morning in that real
[1:12:19] fresh cool morning God has refreshed as
[1:12:20] Earth fragrance did you ever go down to
[1:12:23] a rose and he said down at by place they
[1:12:25] got a lot of honeysuckles the
[1:12:26] honeysuckle don't smell much along In
[1:12:28] the Heat of the day when it's all hustle
[1:12:29] and bustle he said but it's early in the
[1:12:32] morning when all the air has been
[1:12:34] purified then that Aroma of the
[1:12:37] Honeysuckle and he Likens it he says let
[1:12:39] a man be out fussing fighting stewing
[1:12:42] with his mind and just he says you'll
[1:12:45] never get much Aroma from that of the
[1:12:47] Gospel the gospel won't come out of that
[1:12:49] it's just all worked up and all the sort
[1:12:50] of
[1:12:51] carryon but let him get alone one time
[1:12:54] in the Stillness of God every man that
[1:12:57] comes to the pilit ought to dwell alone
[1:12:58] first then comes the fruits yielding
[1:13:00] forth its fruits every man that stays in
[1:13:02] the presence of God into this great
[1:13:04] secret place hid away will yield the
[1:13:06] fruits of righteousness peace love joy
[1:13:09] long suffering goodness gentleness
[1:13:10] patience don't fuss about these other
[1:13:12] things all up here get that in your life
[1:13:15] and you'll never get that until you hide
[1:13:17] away with God into that land of adoption
[1:13:19] into the secret place but that's what's
[1:13:21] that's what belongs to us yes I got one
[1:13:24] I got this one here I want to read this
[1:13:27] why do you hunger Church why do you
[1:13:29] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[1:13:31] this hidden secret to you God's there
[1:13:33] wanting to reveal to us all of his
[1:13:34] Secrets amen amen but you let so many
[1:13:37] things get it out of you you know in
[1:13:38] terms of it distracts you to find other
[1:13:41] secrets that are worthless secrets to
[1:13:43] know you let your job you let your wife
[1:13:46] let your husband you let your children
[1:13:47] you let the cares of this world you let
[1:13:49] some Pastor you let somebody else get
[1:13:50] that out of you when you know that way
[1:13:53] down in your heart you're thirsting
[1:13:54] hungry it's God trying to reveal to you
[1:13:56] see the Revelation the last day is here
[1:13:59] he's got so many secrets for us now more
[1:14:01] so than he ever has before he's
[1:14:02] revealing more secrets to his people now
[1:14:05] than he ever has he's got so many
[1:14:06] secrets to just reveal amen and another
[1:14:11] thing about the secret is actually in
[1:14:13] this time there's a secret of the end
[1:14:15] time like I just said there there are
[1:14:16] secrets now that he's saying well this
[1:14:18] is the time I'm going to reveal all my
[1:14:19] secrets amen and he's he he's made it
[1:14:22] public and yet only those that are part
[1:14:24] of his will actually receive these
[1:14:26] secrets that's why he said here but thou
[1:14:29] oh Daniel shut up the words and seal up
[1:14:31] the book even unto the time of the end
[1:14:34] don't tell these secrets yet I've got a
[1:14:36] People AR going to tell all these
[1:14:36] secrets to many shall run to and fro and
[1:14:39] knowledge shall be increased and he say
[1:14:42] say surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:14:44] but he Reveals His secrets to unto a
[1:14:47] servants the prophets yes and then they
[1:14:49] Minister those Secrets God tells God
[1:14:51] told Paul a lot of Secrets and then he
[1:14:53] said Paul Minister this All Through the
[1:14:55] Ages he's told people secrets and this
[1:14:58] is where we're at now but in the days of
[1:15:00] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:15:01] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:15:03] should be finished all his secrets are
[1:15:05] going to be told as Heath declared to
[1:15:07] his servants the prophets and we've had
[1:15:09] a um messenger that's come here to tell
[1:15:11] all the secrets of God and he and he he
[1:15:14] says this he says now God's secret
[1:15:16] mystery he had before the world began
[1:15:19] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:15:21] there was something that he was trying
[1:15:22] to and was going to Chief and he had a
[1:15:24] motive in doing it in order to let
[1:15:25] himself be expressed his he said God way
[1:15:27] back they had the secret in this plan
[1:15:29] and I'm going to tell you what the plan
[1:15:30] is that's what he told us I'm going to
[1:15:32] tell you what God's plan is this great
[1:15:34] Eternal guy way back before anyone was
[1:15:36] here and he said you know what his plan
[1:15:38] is his plan is to express himself
[1:15:40] completely to man amen to to come down
[1:15:42] as God in Christ to show that I'm one of
[1:15:44] you to to be understandable not to be
[1:15:45] this God that fills all time of space
[1:15:47] but to actually become a man the great
[1:15:49] God I I'll become like you and he said
[1:15:51] the second thing was to have Liberty
[1:15:54] and to dwell in them and express himself
[1:15:56] through them to that they would be
[1:15:58] submitted to me like Paul says Paul a
[1:16:00] prisoner of Jesus Christ that they could
[1:16:02] be they they could subdue their flesh
[1:16:04] and I could dwell in them and I could
[1:16:05] have a liberty to live through them and
[1:16:07] the third thing was to restore the
[1:16:08] kingdom back to the way it was when Adam
[1:16:09] was here restore back to that I've got
[1:16:11] this plan and I'm going to achieve that
[1:16:13] plan amen I want to read you this
[1:16:15] because this is this is powerful look
[1:16:17] what was once God's Great secret great
[1:16:19] mysterious Secret in his mind is now put
[1:16:22] into the hearts of the belever that is
[1:16:23] the body of Christ what was God's once
[1:16:26] great Secret in his mind before the
[1:16:28] foundation of the world is now made
[1:16:29] manifest he's revealing his secrets to
[1:16:32] us think of it friend oh I'm sure we
[1:16:34] don't we don't get it well I I can't see
[1:16:36] it the way I ought to and I'm sure that
[1:16:38] you don't but God's great mystery what
[1:16:41] the Eternal God had as a mystery has now
[1:16:44] been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given
[1:16:46] right down to his church amen what was
[1:16:49] once in God's mind is now in the body of
[1:16:51] Christ Jesus making love to the Church
[1:16:53] his bride Whispering secrets to her you
[1:16:56] know how you tell your wife or your
[1:16:57] husband things you know the little girl
[1:16:59] that you're going to marry you love her
[1:17:00] so much you just tell her the secrets to
[1:17:03] get her up next to you and love you and
[1:17:05] everything you know what it is that's
[1:17:06] what God Christ is doing to the church
[1:17:08] he is letting her know the secrets just
[1:17:10] the secrets not these flirters I mean
[1:17:12] his wife amen by having the revelation
[1:17:15] of a secret made known to them by his
[1:17:17] grace how the grace of God and the last
[1:17:19] one here says people I know I hope you
[1:17:22] don't think this personal to a bunch of
[1:17:24] people he's saying I hope you think it's
[1:17:25] not just for a little group he says God
[1:17:27] is sharing it with the whole church with
[1:17:29] he's trying to share it with everyone
[1:17:30] but not everyone will receive it he says
[1:17:32] if they would just receive it see it
[1:17:34] doesn't mean just me or just you it
[1:17:36] means the church and he is trying to get
[1:17:37] it to get it and you say well why don't
[1:17:40] they receive it he said they can't
[1:17:41] receive it he said again he said these
[1:17:43] things and how could they because oziah
[1:17:45] said they can't see it seeing they won't
[1:17:47] see it hearing they won't perceive it
[1:17:49] right so it's just it's even though he's
[1:17:51] put it out there it's public it's it's
[1:17:52] not this little cult that it's just for
[1:17:54] us no it's for anyone here it all is
[1:17:56] it's all
[1:17:57] open and and brother Brown said now did
[1:18:01] you notice before he was going to reveal
[1:18:02] the great unfold The Mystery of the
[1:18:04] seven cells which actually unlocks the
[1:18:06] whole word of God it just opens
[1:18:07] everything up before he was going to do
[1:18:08] that he said do you notice there was a
[1:18:10] there was a he said there was a
[1:18:11] mysterious light showed up in the
[1:18:13] heavens which was a cloud and even the
[1:18:15] the public the Science magazine there I
[1:18:18] think it was quite fitting that their
[1:18:20] title was a high Cloud a ring of Mystery
[1:18:23] yeah what's this
[1:18:25] mystery this is all a mystery that's
[1:18:27] right it's a mystery that's being
[1:18:30] revealed it it was a mystery
[1:18:33] and and then he said after that happened
[1:18:36] then he said he sent me back to at that
[1:18:39] time to and said that that it's time to
[1:18:41] break open the seals and to to minister
[1:18:44] the to reveal the word of God reveal my
[1:18:47] things I've had hidden it's time to
[1:18:49] reveal that now in doing that God showed
[1:18:52] Who We Are
[1:18:53] yeah in Christ and and all all that
[1:18:55] pertains to us but also in doing that he
[1:18:58] showed who the enemy was so while he
[1:19:01] revealed the secrets of who we are he
[1:19:02] actually revealed the secrets of who the
[1:19:04] enemy is and what he's up to and what
[1:19:06] what he's been scheming now when you
[1:19:08] reveal the secrets of someone's secret
[1:19:10] plan they generally don't like you very
[1:19:12] much Satan had the secret plan that he
[1:19:14] was working and scheming and and he had
[1:19:16] the church all bound up and he was
[1:19:17] winning and then someone came and
[1:19:19] revealed all the secrets I can guarantee
[1:19:22] you he's going to be very upet with that
[1:19:23] little new unfolding that new that new
[1:19:26] thing that's happened so don't be
[1:19:28] surprised when you get all this all this
[1:19:30] nonsense against the the revealed word
[1:19:32] just coming at it from every direction
[1:19:34] because Satan's upset right I want to go
[1:19:37] just to I just talk about
[1:19:39] that talk about people being upset
[1:19:42] because they reveal Secrets who knows
[1:19:44] this guy was um not snow it was the
[1:19:47] other dude um uh jul Julian Assange
[1:19:52] someone watches the
[1:19:53] news Australian guy so he had a website
[1:19:57] called Wikileaks and he would get
[1:19:59] different information and a a contractor
[1:20:01] for the US military that had had access
[1:20:04] to a lot of uh secret information
[1:20:07] thought that the secret information
[1:20:09] needed to be exposed because he thought
[1:20:10] that what the government were doing were
[1:20:12] wrong so I'm going to expose these
[1:20:14] secrets and so he went to this guy and
[1:20:16] he said he got all the data and he gave
[1:20:18] it to this guy to publish on his
[1:20:21] website and and one of the one of the
[1:20:24] things that the videos they published
[1:20:26] were this was Iraq you know it was a
[1:20:29] video of the the American soldiers
[1:20:32] basically just they just killed all
[1:20:34] these guys it was essentially it was
[1:20:36] just murder you know they they didn't
[1:20:37] have any guns they thought they might
[1:20:38] have these two of them were journalists
[1:20:40] and it was just a routine operation and
[1:20:43] they just murdered all these guys and it
[1:20:45] was kind of a bit of a joke you know
[1:20:46] yeah we got them good shooting John you
[1:20:48] know and then you know guys are trying
[1:20:51] to run away they're just getting mowed
[1:20:53] down by these Apache helicopters and
[1:20:54] machine guns and then they you know and
[1:20:56] this other guy he's he's crawling along
[1:20:58] and they're saying they they've got
[1:21:00] their gun on him and they're saying oh
[1:21:01] there's a guy crawling away uh pick up a
[1:21:04] gun man pick up a gun they want him to
[1:21:06] do something so they can shoot him
[1:21:07] because they have to at least have some
[1:21:09] reason but he he he just stays here and
[1:21:11] then a van pulls up and starts to load
[1:21:14] the wounded up and they get permission
[1:21:16] to shoot the van or shoot everyone in
[1:21:18] the van as well so just blast the van
[1:21:20] and there's kids in the van and all
[1:21:21] sorts it's basically murder
[1:21:23] right and so this man is seeing the
[1:21:25] stuff and he's saying well I got to get
[1:21:26] this out cuz I mean there I know war is
[1:21:28] war but there then there's murder
[1:21:29] there's a There are rules you can't just
[1:21:31] go and murder people so so then he
[1:21:35] publishes this but because he's
[1:21:36] published all of these secrets the US
[1:21:38] government doesn't like him anymore you
[1:21:40] know you've published all my secrets and
[1:21:43] we don't like you and so he had to he
[1:21:46] had to get and going hiding and and try
[1:21:48] and escape and uh they brought up some
[1:21:52] bogus charges some girl in Sweden said
[1:21:55] that he raped her which was just a bogus
[1:21:57] one and he knew it was they were only
[1:21:58] doing that to get him in custody and
[1:22:00] when they were in custody that the US
[1:22:01] government was going to file charges and
[1:22:03] then have them extradited to the US and
[1:22:05] lock them up and throw away the key sort
[1:22:06] of scenario that he knew that's what was
[1:22:08] happening so instead of facing these
[1:22:09] charges of rape he took refuge in the
[1:22:12] Ecuadorian Embassy in in the UK and they
[1:22:15] they sort of granted him uh uh and yeah
[1:22:20] because these these these embassies are
[1:22:23] kind of like it's it's a separate
[1:22:25] country within a country so the the the
[1:22:27] UK police can't walk into the embassy
[1:22:29] because they're essentially going into
[1:22:31] Ecuador it would be an act of War right
[1:22:33] so so they said you can stay in the
[1:22:35] embassy indefinitely so he was there
[1:22:37] from 2012 to about
[1:22:40] 2019 s years he lived in a room in the
[1:22:43] embassy and this is how much the people
[1:22:47] were upset the government was upset the
[1:22:50] the the British government had police
[1:22:52] police wait outside this many police for
[1:22:55] 2 and 1 half years they waited outside
[1:22:57] in case the guy tried to come out and
[1:22:58] Escape I think they spent about 122
[1:23:01] million guarding the place after about 2
[1:23:04] and a half years the public was saying
[1:23:05] come on team you've spent 125 million on
[1:23:09] this guy just don't worry about it you
[1:23:11] know say but they had these guys waiting
[1:23:14] day and night out the front in case this
[1:23:16] guy tries to get away they there was
[1:23:17] somebody very upset that this guy gave
[1:23:20] away their secrets they were going to go
[1:23:22] to any and at the same time another guy
[1:23:25] this guy Snowden he maybe a year after
[1:23:28] that he actually he worked for the he
[1:23:29] was a contractor for the NSA and he he
[1:23:32] gave out this information to show that
[1:23:34] you know the government was spying on
[1:23:36] the on not just foreign governments but
[1:23:38] on all their own people and they were
[1:23:39] gathering data essentially saying what
[1:23:41] we all knew was everything on your phone
[1:23:43] is recorded they had access to all the
[1:23:44] servers and they're just basically
[1:23:46] nothing is private it's all going to
[1:23:47] them even though they say no no we can't
[1:23:49] do that New Zealand was all involved
[1:23:51] with this because it was a five eyes
[1:23:53] countries it was all just so he exposed
[1:23:55] all of this and and so now they're after
[1:23:58] this guy as well there the US government
[1:24:00] were after Edward Snowden and so he he
[1:24:03] released the documents when he was in
[1:24:05] Hong Kong then his plan was to go to
[1:24:07] South America to a friendly country
[1:24:09] there and and maybe live there
[1:24:12] but I think he went he was going Hong
[1:24:16] Kong Russia and then down to Ecuador was
[1:24:18] a Transit flight but when he by the time
[1:24:20] he got to Russia the US government had
[1:24:22] gotten on to him that it was this guy
[1:24:24] that leaked all the information and they
[1:24:26] canceled his
[1:24:28] passport where while he was in Russia so
[1:24:30] he's in Russia and and and the Russian
[1:24:32] government you know they go to scan his
[1:24:34] passport and they realize this passport
[1:24:35] has been canceled
[1:24:38] so so now um Assange is going to help
[1:24:43] this guy he says okay well we can we'll
[1:24:45] try and get a a a a president of a
[1:24:48] friendly country in South America we'll
[1:24:50] try and fly you out on their plan
[1:24:52] because you won't get out using normal
[1:24:55] channels now of public transport but but
[1:24:58] foreign governments and their presidents
[1:25:00] they can fly in with immunity and sort
[1:25:02] of they didn't have to you know go under
[1:25:04] the same so
[1:25:08] they but they knew that everything they
[1:25:09] were doing was being listened to so they
[1:25:12] were formulating a plan but they were
[1:25:14] formulating it with another uh uh
[1:25:17] another country but they said it was the
[1:25:19] Bolivia they said when they were talking
[1:25:21] that they said it's Bolivia that we're
[1:25:23] going to use the Bolivian president's
[1:25:25] plane and he's going to come in and pick
[1:25:26] you up and and take you away but it
[1:25:29] wasn't the Bolivian president's playing
[1:25:31] it with someone else but they just threw
[1:25:33] a bit of a decoy so then the Bolivian
[1:25:35] president flies to Russia for some oil
[1:25:38] meeting starts flying back home and
[1:25:41] because the government US government
[1:25:42] have been Eve dropping and all these
[1:25:44] calls they said I think snowden's on
[1:25:46] that plane so they rung up uh France
[1:25:51] Spain Italy and said there's a plane
[1:25:54] coming deny them access to your
[1:25:56] airspace and so the these countries
[1:26:00] denied their plane access and this plane
[1:26:01] had to go and land in um Austria and
[1:26:05] they searched the plane for Edward
[1:26:06] Snowden now this is totally against the
[1:26:08] rules you cannot you you can't do this
[1:26:10] to president's planes but he said that
[1:26:12] just goes to show you how corrupt the
[1:26:13] whole thing is a phone call close your
[1:26:15] airspace and they down this plane this
[1:26:17] guy's like what's going on here cuz cuz
[1:26:20] they yeah but that's how desperate they
[1:26:21] were to this guy they they'll stop a
[1:26:24] presidential plane to catch this guy
[1:26:27] think of how much Satan hates you you
[1:26:29] know all these secrets and he hates this
[1:26:31] message because it's revealed his whole
[1:26:32] plan he just hates you he hates you he's
[1:26:34] going to go to any length to see that we
[1:26:36] don't succeed that's that's what he's
[1:26:39] doing in the end Snowden became a he's
[1:26:41] now a a citizen of Russia he's lived
[1:26:44] there for so long he's now become a
[1:26:46] citizen of
[1:26:47] Russia and and incidently enough after I
[1:26:50] think 2019 this
[1:26:53] Snowden uh Assange got something
[1:26:56] happened in the embassy and then they
[1:26:58] the Russia the police from the UK went
[1:27:00] and arrested him he's he was in he's
[1:27:02] basically been in solitary confinement
[1:27:03] from then to now 23 hours a day sitting
[1:27:06] in a Cell he L out 1 hour a day waiting
[1:27:09] for charges he's not being charged he's
[1:27:11] waiting for charges and I think that
[1:27:13] this was actually last week of all times
[1:27:15] was
[1:27:16] when he's on he's sort of at the last uh
[1:27:19] part of his court battle to try not to
[1:27:21] be extradited to the United States so
[1:27:23] that they've had the court case and
[1:27:25] they're going to decide within a week or
[1:27:26] two so this is happening so think of
[1:27:28] what you were doing in
[1:27:29] 2012 to now this guy's been going
[1:27:31] through this since
[1:27:33] 2012 but that's how desperate and that
[1:27:37] that Satan's going to be doing the same
[1:27:39] thing towards us that's why when you go
[1:27:41] online you say all this sort of stuff
[1:27:42] you know it's all he's just going to
[1:27:44] attack this message as much as he can
[1:27:45] it's going to be everywhere to to
[1:27:47] because he knows it's exposed to all of
[1:27:48] his Secrets because this message has
[1:27:50] effect on people it changes life you
[1:27:52] know it changes lives and I I want to
[1:27:56] keep talking about this now that that
[1:27:58] God when he when when the seven cells
[1:28:00] were revealed there was it's like the I
[1:28:03] just want to read the seventh one was
[1:28:04] kept the mystery in a sense it was like
[1:28:06] a he said God's great mystery of how
[1:28:08] it's a secret he kept it a secret
[1:28:10] talking about the seven cells no one the
[1:28:11] seventh cell no one know nothing about
[1:28:13] it even the angels didn't understand see
[1:28:15] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:28:17] under our seventh mystery when the
[1:28:18] seventh seil was open there was silence
[1:28:21] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[1:28:22] to know when he would come he said it's
[1:28:24] not even the son of God don't know when
[1:28:26] it's going to happen see God has a all
[1:28:28] to himself it's a secret so saying this
[1:28:29] a secret of the seven C it's just kept
[1:28:31] the secret which is the coming of the
[1:28:33] Lord
[1:28:34] and and that's the reason there was
[1:28:36] silence at heaven for a space of half an
[1:28:38] hour and seven Thunders uted their
[1:28:39] voices and John was even forbidden to
[1:28:41] write write it see the coming of the
[1:28:43] Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:28:45] yet of how he will come and when he will
[1:28:46] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:28:49] no he has revealed all the six CS but he
[1:28:52] don't say nothing about the seventh and
[1:28:54] the end time Cale when it starts it will
[1:28:56] be absolutely a total
[1:28:59] secret the coming of the Lord and he's
[1:29:01] coming in you he's coming in me it's
[1:29:02] just the secrets of being revealed just
[1:29:04] to those that he's coming for it's just
[1:29:05] a secret being unfolded just to his
[1:29:08] bride amen it'll be an absolute total
[1:29:10] secret according to the Bible therefore
[1:29:12] known that and remember Revelations 10
[1:29:14] 1-7 and 10 at the end of the seventh
[1:29:17] Angel's message all the Mysteries or all
[1:29:18] the secrets of God will be none we're at
[1:29:20] the end time the opening of the seventh
[1:29:22] seventh cell which is the coming of the
[1:29:24] Lord but it's also a coming of the Lord
[1:29:25] in you it's just it's all just the
[1:29:27] secret being unveiled and that brings us
[1:29:29] on to this concept now this the Rapture
[1:29:31] is not a secret it's just that many
[1:29:33] people are going to be a part of it
[1:29:34] because they don't want to be so then we
[1:29:36] get the secret going away of the Bride
[1:29:38] it's just a it's just this little secret
[1:29:39] thing that that that brother BR says why
[1:29:42] there wasn't I guess onethird of the
[1:29:44] whole Jewish race ever know that Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ was on Earth didn't they they
[1:29:48] might have heard some fanatic along down
[1:29:50] there somewhere but they didn't pay any
[1:29:51] ATT attention to it just go on you know
[1:29:54] he came to his own and his own received
[1:29:55] him not now there is where I believe
[1:29:57] even now I didn't say he would secretly
[1:29:59] come because it doesn't say that but he
[1:30:01] said when he come how much more will
[1:30:03] they will the Rapture be unknown see
[1:30:05] they they won't know directly they'll
[1:30:07] say well I thought that we were supposed
[1:30:08] to have a Rapture and all this judgment
[1:30:10] upon the Earth and he say it's already
[1:30:12] taken place and you didn't know it see
[1:30:13] it'll be just like a thief in the night
[1:30:15] he's saying it'll just be a secret it's
[1:30:17] just a secret for the bride it's just
[1:30:18] it's just it's for whomsoever Will and
[1:30:21] but those that to be in the secret place
[1:30:22] and meet God and fellowship with him
[1:30:24] it's now between him and
[1:30:26] them at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:30:28] we are supposed to receive according to
[1:30:30] the word of God uh to according to the
[1:30:32] word as God helped me tonight to show
[1:30:33] you through here that we are to see
[1:30:36] receive a messenger that will take all
[1:30:38] those loose ends out there and reveal
[1:30:40] the whole Secret Of God for the
[1:30:41] rapturing of the
[1:30:42] church that's where we're at I've got
[1:30:44] amen and now at the coming of the Lord
[1:30:47] Jesus those who are really loving his
[1:30:49] coming that's living for it when he
[1:30:51] appears in the the sky the church that's
[1:30:52] dead in Christ shall rise the the the
[1:30:54] the saints that have been sleeping that
[1:30:56] actually knew the secret they'll rise
[1:30:58] and those will be changed in a moment
[1:30:59] the rest of them will know nothing about
[1:31:01] it see because when Jesus came it says
[1:31:03] that some of the Saints arose and
[1:31:04] appeared in the city not all of them
[1:31:06] just just those ones the Rapture will be
[1:31:09] like that we'll see each other and then
[1:31:11] we'll see them amen hallelujah amen and
[1:31:15] the rest of the world won't see them
[1:31:17] it'll be caught away as a secret going
[1:31:18] waiting for that time so that's the
[1:31:20] secret we've got this secret waiting for
[1:31:23] us I want to move on to something now
[1:31:25] the secret of the hearts you know we
[1:31:26] talk about these secrets but you know
[1:31:27] there's also secrets of our hearts that
[1:31:30] that that we could possibly
[1:31:32] have and a scripture in Corinthians says
[1:31:36] if therefore the whole church be come
[1:31:38] together into one place and all speak
[1:31:39] with tongues and there comeing those
[1:31:41] that are unlearned or unbelievers will
[1:31:43] they not say that you are mad because
[1:31:46] they just you're speaking in a language
[1:31:47] they don't understand and it's just all
[1:31:48] this carry on and they're going this is
[1:31:50] crazy man what's happening here yeah but
[1:31:52] he says but if all prophesy actually
[1:31:54] speak and prophesy something and there
[1:31:56] comeing one that believeth not or one
[1:31:58] unlearned he has convinced of all he has
[1:31:59] judged of all and thus are the secrets
[1:32:02] of his heart made manifest and so
[1:32:04] falling down on his face he will worship

[1:32:59] the secret of every heart now I'm going
[1:33:01] to read these I'm going this is just
[1:33:02] quotes but I just want to read these
[1:33:04] little stories to you because I want to
[1:33:06] make this impactive okay I've got four
[1:33:08] of them a young lady came up into the
[1:33:10] house here not long ago been prayed for
[1:33:12] so much till she had been anointed 50
[1:33:14] times I guess how that everything had
[1:33:16] taken place I had prayed for her through
[1:33:18] there I had prayed for her there but sit
[1:33:20] down in the room one morning when the
[1:33:22] angel of the Lord came near he began to
[1:33:24] speak to her and tell her just what she
[1:33:25] had done and something she was harboring
[1:33:28] back in in her soul she had had it there
[1:33:31] for eight long years there was a secret
[1:33:33] there men had prayed for her she' gone
[1:33:35] to all sorts of things trying to make
[1:33:37] this thing go but there was just a
[1:33:38] little secret laying down
[1:33:41] there then he revealed it to her he said
[1:33:43] she wouldn't tell nobody her secret the
[1:33:45] psychiatrist couldn't pull it out of her
[1:33:47] and she almost fainted when she was told
[1:33:50] the secret fell on the floor and began
[1:33:51] to cry and I said you go make that right
[1:33:54] and God will heal you that's right she
[1:33:56] went and go her husband and made the
[1:33:57] thing right and came back up she's
[1:33:59] healed today cuz God exposed the secret
[1:34:02] that was that she was trying to hide how
[1:34:05] many knows who I'm talking about in the
[1:34:06] building many of you do sure I think if
[1:34:08] I'm not mistaken the woman may be
[1:34:10] sitting here now it was a very
[1:34:12] embarrassing thing kind of is when
[1:34:13] Secrets get revealed but God did the
[1:34:16] work now see all of the praying all the
[1:34:18] Stomping all the casting out of evil
[1:34:19] spirits she was harboring way down deep
[1:34:22] in your heart that she didn't want to
[1:34:24] tell nobody that she did it but the Holy
[1:34:27] Spirit revealed The Secret of your heart
[1:34:29] she went and made that right then she
[1:34:31] was clear God won't bless over the top
[1:34:33] of sin you got to clear it up first
[1:34:34] that's right that's right amen another
[1:34:36] one reminds me of another case one day I
[1:34:38] just came home um if I'm not mistaken
[1:34:41] they were there was a an escapan or
[1:34:43] Presbyterian people that had brought a
[1:34:45] little girl from Kansas and the doctors
[1:34:47] had give her up with leukemia and they
[1:34:50] gave you I believe 4 days to live she
[1:34:52] had gotten so bad so they said they just
[1:34:55] spend those four days coming over here
[1:34:57] through the snow drifts and things
[1:34:58] across the country to have her prayed
[1:35:00] for and the grandfather a very fine
[1:35:02] looking elderly man was gray-haired and
[1:35:04] they had her already 2 days down here in
[1:35:08] a motel I guess it isn't stand there now
[1:35:10] this is this side of Silver Creek and so
[1:35:13] I went down that night to pray for her
[1:35:15] it was early in the morning I came in
[1:35:17] that night from out of town and went
[1:35:18] down and the elderly father grandfather
[1:35:20] was walking and the floor and the mother
[1:35:22] trying to take care of her child and
[1:35:24] while I knelt to pray the Holy Spirit
[1:35:26] revealed to me a secret that was between
[1:35:28] the mother and the father of something
[1:35:30] they had done I called them to the side
[1:35:33] and asked them about it they started
[1:35:34] crying and said that's right because
[1:35:36] something
[1:35:38] happened then he said and this is a
[1:35:39] vision then he says I look back and I
[1:35:41] seen the little girl skipping a rope
[1:35:43] going and playing once they' made that
[1:35:45] right he saw he saw the girl in a vision
[1:35:47] and then he says and later on and now
[1:35:49] about 3 weeks after that they sent me a
[1:35:51] picture of the little girl back in
[1:35:52] school skipping a rope had no leukemia
[1:35:53] at all that's the almighty God that we
[1:35:56] serve sometimes it's a bit embarrassing
[1:35:57] for us but you know when us if there's
[1:35:59] any Secret in their heart and anything
[1:36:01] you know I think I'd rather have an
[1:36:04] alive daughter and a wee bit of
[1:36:06] embarrassment rather than a dead
[1:36:07] daughter and hold the secret in my heart
[1:36:10] amen that that's that's where we're at
[1:36:12] folks come on
[1:36:15] now now this is him talking to a mother
[1:36:18] he's saying you have you have some
[1:36:19] children you have a boy overseas you
[1:36:20] want to see him don't you mother you
[1:36:22] will I want him to see you too now look

[1:38:04] an awesome God we serve that he can he
[1:38:06] has got that he loves us enough to re to
[1:38:09] show us these little secrets last one
[1:38:11] here with this thought I was speaking a
[1:38:14] little Club footed baby came by you
[1:38:16] remember the little feet in like that I
[1:38:18] seen the vision what have caused it what
[1:38:19] have taken place I took the little baby
[1:38:20] to side and asked the parents the secret
[1:38:23] that they were doing in the line of
[1:38:24] birth control and things that wasn't
[1:38:26] right he's saying you're doing the
[1:38:27] certain thing so I talked to them
[1:38:28] privately and so they I asked them if
[1:38:31] they' do a certain thing like are you
[1:38:33] doing this and will you change it and
[1:38:35] they said yes we will that's what we're
[1:38:36] doing and we will change it he said now
[1:38:38] take the brace off the baby and they sat
[1:38:41] down there cut those CLS off the baby
[1:38:43] and its little feet was just as normal
[1:38:45] as they could be walked on off and went
[1:38:48] onise God last one for this thought
[1:38:51] Peter this this was ananas and saf they
[1:38:54] thought they could hold a secret from
[1:38:56] God when when all the the the the the
[1:38:58] pressure leadership of the Holy Ghost at
[1:39:00] that time was for people to sell all
[1:39:02] that they have and to give the money to
[1:39:03] the disciples and they were going to
[1:39:05] spread it around amongst the people and
[1:39:06] just go out and Minister the word of God
[1:39:08] and just as the Lord LED so they got
[1:39:09] caught up in this idea of doing that but
[1:39:11] in their heart they didn't really want
[1:39:12] to so they sold their house and they
[1:39:14] thought we'll just keep some of it we'll
[1:39:16] give them maybe 50% we'll keep the other
[1:39:17] 50% and they schemed amongst themselves
[1:39:19] as husband and wife and they came to
[1:39:22] Peter and said and Peter when they came
[1:39:24] before Peter God revealed the secret to
[1:39:26] Peter what they had done he said these
[1:39:28] people are going to tell you this is the
[1:39:29] full price of their house but theyve
[1:39:31] keeping back half that they could they
[1:39:32] could have kept a whole lot was their
[1:39:34] money God didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:39:36] mind it was a fact that they tried to
[1:39:38] tell it to lie and and scheme this
[1:39:40] little secret but the secret was
[1:39:42] revealed Peter said do you sell it for
[1:39:44] this much he said yeah I did and he said
[1:39:45] you told a lie and and when his secret
[1:39:48] was revealed he dropped down and died
[1:39:50] then his I think I believe that's the
[1:39:52] the wife came in and they said oh did
[1:39:53] you sell it for this much they said yeah
[1:39:55] that's what we did and he said the same
[1:39:57] people that carried your husband will
[1:39:58] carry you it as well and she died as
[1:40:00] well just trying to keep a secret from
[1:40:01] God just be honest with God he knows
[1:40:03] everything anyway don't keep a secret he
[1:40:05] knows
[1:40:07] everything Amen in time of death I've
[1:40:09] heard people when they know they were
[1:40:11] dying the things they kept secret all
[1:40:12] their life they in desperation they were
[1:40:14] trying to confess see trying to say take
[1:40:16] this make it right do this when they
[1:40:17] were dying they knew I'm going to face a
[1:40:19] God that knows all things yeah something
[1:40:21] in the human heart knows I'm going to a
[1:40:24] place that everything's going to be
[1:40:25] exposed and and this secret I've managed
[1:40:28] to hold from this person that person
[1:40:29] from my wife from everyone but I've got
[1:40:31] to meet a God and and they know human
[1:40:34] beings know themselves my secrets all
[1:40:37] going to be uncovered I I'm going to
[1:40:38] stand before whoever it is there I'm
[1:40:40] going to stand before somebody and it's
[1:40:41] all going to be made known and and I
[1:40:44] thought there was a powerful thought you
[1:40:46] know of these deathbed confessions of
[1:40:48] Secrets and things that they've done
[1:40:49] it's actually very common
[1:40:51] death bear confession saying now that
[1:40:52] I've come to die I'm going to I'm going
[1:40:54] to tell all this now because they know
[1:40:57] they don't want to cross the line with
[1:40:58] that on themen I was surprised at some
[1:41:01] of the things you know there was this
[1:41:02] this man was in he was actually in New
[1:41:05] Zealand he was actually the he became
[1:41:07] known as the first serial killer but no
[1:41:09] one knew he did that he he was a bit of
[1:41:12] a Riff Raff just up and down sort of
[1:41:15] life and he was in out of prison for
[1:41:17] different things but he did end up
[1:41:18] murdering somebody which they charged
[1:41:20] him for never admitted to murdering this
[1:41:22] person he said no it wasn't me it wasn't
[1:41:24] me but he did get charged for it um then
[1:41:27] he escaped and he got caught again but
[1:41:30] on his deathbed he said he just said
[1:41:33] look I've you know I've been an awful
[1:41:34] man my whole life I not only did I kill
[1:41:36] that person I killed three other people
[1:41:38] and and he confessed to killing this
[1:41:40] this lady here was actually a Christian
[1:41:43] lady her and her sister worked at the
[1:41:44] Salvation Army on wi and this was in the
[1:41:47] 40s this was 1942 and she'd actually
[1:41:49] been a missionary to Japan and come back
[1:41:51] so during the war she was quite
[1:41:53] sympathetic of the Japanese because she
[1:41:54] was a missionary there and I think she
[1:41:56] had quite a outspoken personality CU she
[1:41:59] would go down to the local pub and tell
[1:42:02] all the guys down there as they were
[1:42:03] drinking that you're all going to go to
[1:42:04] hell you got to stop drinking you're all
[1:42:06] Sinners condemned to hell she was an
[1:42:08] evangelist and no one liked her and this
[1:42:10] guy word got around that she had a whole
[1:42:11] lot of money stash in her place so
[1:42:13] that's why this guy just went around
[1:42:14] there and just killed her trying to find
[1:42:15] the money and killed her older sister
[1:42:17] she was 60 and her sister was like 74
[1:42:19] just killed them and he killed another
[1:42:21] man but I don't know I find it
[1:42:23] interesting that you know God exposed Us
[1:42:25] in the end to to tell us that because
[1:42:26] that was his his woman you know she was
[1:42:29] actually she was a
[1:42:31] Believer this other man killed someone
[1:42:34] when he was in the in the
[1:42:36] 70s she was actually a sex worker but
[1:42:39] then he went on and had got away with it
[1:42:41] then he went on had a had a family
[1:42:43] raised children and that and then on his
[1:42:45] deathbed he couldn't really speak
[1:42:46] anymore but then he wrote this letter
[1:42:47] and said to whoever it concerns I would
[1:42:50] like to put the record straight I can't
[1:42:52] go on with the guilt I've lived with it
[1:42:54] for over 20 years he's trying to confess
[1:42:56] it trying to say sorry but he but he
[1:42:58] knows he's got to go to the Grave with
[1:42:59] us he had a chance to to confess it when
[1:43:01] he was around but he he held it his
[1:43:03] whole life and he took it to the Grave
[1:43:05] he said I'm truly sorry for the pain
[1:43:06] I've caused I'm sorry you know I love my
[1:43:08] kids and and help me God it's funny when
[1:43:11] people are there they call out to God
[1:43:13] but often times it's sometimes it's too
[1:43:15] late not always but you know cuz they
[1:43:19] realize right at the end well actually
[1:43:20] hang on someone's going I'm I'm meeting
[1:43:22] someone that's going to know what I've
[1:43:23] done and he he died like that this this
[1:43:26] other person was horrible she an
[1:43:28] African-American man this was in the 70s
[1:43:30] went to her house and she accused him of
[1:43:34] um
[1:43:35] rape and robbery and so this man got
[1:43:39] charged for that and was in prison for
[1:43:41] 12 years for this attempted rape and
[1:43:44] robbery of this lady but on her deathbed
[1:43:47] she confessed to her neighbor I didn't
[1:43:50] that wasn't true I actually invited him
[1:43:52] in and if I got him actually drunk but I
[1:43:54] just didn't want anyone to know that I'd
[1:43:55] brought this African-American to my
[1:43:57] house cuz she was a bit older he was
[1:43:58] younger and she said truth be n to I
[1:44:00] actually robbed him when he was drunk I
[1:44:02] took his money so she confessed on her
[1:44:04] deathbed and then they let this man out
[1:44:07] because they realized that but you
[1:44:09] imagine being that lady for she she she
[1:44:11] held that secret in her heart she was
[1:44:13] happy that he was another man's life
[1:44:14] ruined and the whole family ruined and
[1:44:17] on her lie and she held that secret in
[1:44:18] her heart right till her death but then
[1:44:20] she told her neighbor that's what I've
[1:44:21] done you know the funny thing was that
[1:44:24] man was a he wasn't a Christian winning
[1:44:26] winner but he said I'm free and I feel
[1:44:28] wonderful this is when he got out he
[1:44:29] said to the
[1:44:30] newspapers he said I was bitter when I
[1:44:33] went in but since I turned my life over
[1:44:35] to Jesus I'm not bter
[1:44:37] anymore and then they gave him about a
[1:44:39] million dollars to go and live the rest
[1:44:40] of his life or something like that you
[1:44:41] know so he came out serving the lord
[1:44:43] wealthy could serve God and she I'm
[1:44:46] going to say she died and went to
[1:44:47] hell
[1:44:49] so
[1:44:52] I've got two more things I want to talk
[1:44:54] about then we're done this
[1:44:55] one's this is a concept that's happening
[1:44:58] now in a natural sense that I just want
[1:45:00] to make sure no one gets caught up in
[1:45:02] there's this idea now in in a in the
[1:45:04] world this wake up you know this all
[1:45:07] these conspiracies and wake up to see
[1:45:09] what's happening you know we've come
[1:45:11] across this big secret you need to wake
[1:45:14] up and and this is what this government
[1:45:16] is doing this is what these bad people
[1:45:18] are doing they're trying to take over
[1:45:19] the world and all this sort of stuff
[1:45:21] now I'm not saying it's there's no not a
[1:45:22] bit of Truth in it but it's become such
[1:45:24] a powerful force if you haven't been
[1:45:27] paying attention to it whole political
[1:45:29] systems and whole countries are there's
[1:45:32] this
[1:45:33] massive do you know what I mean yes it's
[1:45:36] this is massive like 10 12 years ago I
[1:45:39] was looking into some of the stuff and
[1:45:40] this was Fringe 20 years ago I was
[1:45:42] looking into this was Fringe information
[1:45:44] only a few of us in it like yeah yeah
[1:45:46] interesting stuff you know it's
[1:45:47] interesting but it's become now Main
[1:45:50] stream
[1:45:51] headline now it's almost like now to be
[1:45:54] a Christian these days you don't need to
[1:45:55] serve God don't need to do nothing you
[1:45:56] just need to say I oppose Biden I oppose
[1:45:58] these leftwing liberals I oppose this
[1:46:00] and that and you're a Christian and all
[1:46:01] the Christians are caught up in this
[1:46:03] thinking it's a we've uncovered the
[1:46:04] secret now it's a righteous War it's a
[1:46:07] total load of nonsense and they're just
[1:46:09] being dragged in I can see the it's a
[1:46:12] global the Christianity because they've
[1:46:14] cuz they've they've rejected the first
[1:46:17] secret that God actually wanted to
[1:46:18] reveal to them the secret they've just
[1:46:20] gone off onto this total nonsense like
[1:46:23] this sort of stuff Lord Jesus thank you
[1:46:26] for president Trump the Lord doesn't
[1:46:28] really care about Trump in the terms of
[1:46:30] he's not the Savior all this nonsense
[1:46:32] it's just and they're so caught up and
[1:46:35] and and it's like that's Evangelical now
[1:46:37] you know they have seminars on how to
[1:46:39] outreach to your friends to wake them up
[1:46:41] to what's
[1:46:42] happening but it's a total load of
[1:46:45] nonsense but this movement is this is
[1:46:48] massive like we got big names and and
[1:46:50] big people like this was actually the
[1:46:51] guy that played Jesus you know and the
[1:46:53] films come out and this guy's the guy
[1:46:55] that owns my pillow he funds it he's got
[1:46:57] a and but but it but
[1:47:00] then it's a massive war
[1:47:03] because this the baddies are trying to
[1:47:05] take down his business and they're doing
[1:47:07] all these things and the big Walmart had
[1:47:09] taken his pillow out of their shops and
[1:47:11] it's just all out War but it's a war of
[1:47:14] no value and the Christians I think
[1:47:16] people all want some sort of cause they
[1:47:17] fight for and all the Christians that
[1:47:20] that that actually don't have this real
[1:47:21] secret and the real word are just caught
[1:47:23] up in this massive fight even people
[1:47:26] like taka cson like international news
[1:47:28] media figures are caught up in the fight
[1:47:30] you know he was he's now come over to
[1:47:32] the good side and all this sort of stuff
[1:47:33] you know and he then he got fired from
[1:47:35] his organization even though he was the
[1:47:38] he was the guy that was the most viewed
[1:47:39] the most popular guy why would they fire
[1:47:41] him they're saying look that shows they
[1:47:43] just hate anyone that's going on that
[1:47:44] side they fired him
[1:47:47] it Christians are so caught up in this
[1:47:50] it's just just it's nonsense you know
[1:47:52] Alex Jones Trump used to go on there
[1:47:53] before he was president he'd go on these
[1:47:56] and he talk about it and they would you
[1:47:58] know the FBI are arresting old men that
[1:48:00] have done nothing they're shooting
[1:48:01] around to their house and arresting them
[1:48:03] they're saying see look what the baddies
[1:48:04] are doing there these guys are martys
[1:48:06] for the lord they're
[1:48:08] not I'm just saying don't get caught up
[1:48:11] in this nonsense it's actually going to
[1:48:12] drag the church into the mark of the
[1:48:14] beast into that it's it's totally the
[1:48:16] wrong way around they don't realize
[1:48:17] they're being actually it's going to be
[1:48:19] the
[1:48:21] they're going to do it themselves
[1:48:22] they're going to drag themselves into it
[1:48:23] not realizing it's total nonsense so if
[1:48:25] you I mean it's interesting stuff if you
[1:48:27] want to if your brain needs a rest and
[1:48:29] kind of you want to process a bit of
[1:48:30] natural thought but don't get caught up
[1:48:32] in it there are there are people that
[1:48:33] leave churches if the pastor doesn't
[1:48:35] believe that this guy has got some sort
[1:48:37] of agenda well even the church you don't
[1:48:40] believe that uh this guy that what's
[1:48:43] that what's the thing they're
[1:48:44] doing that guy the German guy that like
[1:48:47] they do this like the uh economic World
[1:48:51] economic forum wec and all this you know
[1:48:54] they've got they've got videos now of
[1:48:55] him on the superimposed on the face of a
[1:48:57] bad in the movie and the other guys like
[1:48:59] fighting him and punching him it's just
[1:49:01] nonsense yeah it's it's but you see
[1:49:04] they're caught up in this idea that oh
[1:49:06] we've exposed a secret but and when
[1:49:09] we're going to expose a secret it's not
[1:49:11] a secret it's nonsense yeah it is wanted
[1:49:14] to throw that in because this ain't a
[1:49:15] secret this is just this is
[1:49:18] just rubbish
[1:49:21] I've got two more things this next one
[1:49:23] is keeping things a secret you know we
[1:49:24] talk about actually we shouldn't keep
[1:49:26] things a secret but actually sometimes
[1:49:27] God says keep this a
[1:49:29] secret one of them he talks about he
[1:49:31] says take heed that you do not your arms
[1:49:33] or your giving before men to be seen of
[1:49:35] them otherwise you have no reward of
[1:49:37] your father which is in heaven therefore
[1:49:39] when thou doest thine arms do not sound
[1:49:41] a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites
[1:49:42] do in the synagogues and in the streets
[1:49:45] that they may have Glory of men verely
[1:49:47] areound to they have their reward what I
[1:49:49] mean that's what the world does right
[1:49:50] they have sponsorships hey guys I
[1:49:52] sponsored this event this little
[1:49:54] fledgling operation That Couldn't
[1:49:56] support itself I came along and I gave
[1:49:57] them this much money and I'm going to
[1:49:59] let you know that I did that and aren't
[1:50:00] I so great you know cuz I'm helping out
[1:50:02] this little fledgling
[1:50:03] organization and that's what sometimes
[1:50:05] you know and God's saying if you're a
[1:50:07] Christian don't let your right hand know
[1:50:08] what your left hand does don't be like
[1:50:10] that keep it a secret if you give just
[1:50:13] keep it a secret keep it a secret what
[1:50:14] you're doing he says but when th do THS
[1:50:16] when you give when you do these things
[1:50:18] let not your left hand know what your
[1:50:19] right hand doeth that thine arms may be
[1:50:22] in secret and the Father which seeth in
[1:50:24] secret shall reward thee openly saying
[1:50:26] also if you fast you know don't be like
[1:50:28] the Hypocrites they've got a they look
[1:50:30] like they've got a sad face and look I'm
[1:50:32] so spiritual cuz I'm fasting you know
[1:50:34] anoint your head with oil make it look
[1:50:36] like you nothing yeah it's just another
[1:50:37] day yeah just working doing this and
[1:50:38] doing that you might have be on your
[1:50:39] fourth day fasting just do it between
[1:50:42] you and God Amen and keep it a secret
[1:50:44] and God will reward you openly but don't
[1:50:46] let don't don't try and show how
[1:50:47] spiritual you are sometimes I watch
[1:50:49] these denominational things and they're
[1:50:51] like you know I prayed and I talked to
[1:50:52] God and God told me this and God told me
[1:50:54] that and like having this conversation I
[1:50:56] think man I'm I'm not spiritual at all
[1:50:58] cuz I go to try and talk to God and I
[1:51:00] might get might take me an hour and I I
[1:51:01] get barely get anything you know I think
[1:51:03] man these people are more spiritual than
[1:51:05] me you know BR to S it like that but you
[1:51:07] know it's just it's just like I know God
[1:51:09] this and you know it's all sort of just
[1:51:11] keep it to
[1:51:12] yourself amen he
[1:51:15] says that they appear not to
[1:51:18] fast but um but unto thy father which is
[1:51:21] in secret and thy father which say in
[1:51:22] secret shall reward thee openly one more
[1:51:25] here and when thou prayest thou shall
[1:51:27] not be as the Hypocrites are for they
[1:51:28] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[1:51:30] and in the corners of the streets that
[1:51:32] they may be seen of men verily I say
[1:51:34] unto they have their reward but th When
[1:51:35] you pray enter into the closet then let
[1:51:38] people know what you're doing and when
[1:51:39] th have shut the door pray to the Father
[1:51:40] which is in secret and the Father which
[1:51:42] seeth in secret shall reward the openly
[1:51:44] just keep it a
[1:51:45] secret here's another one a taale bearer
[1:51:48] reveals secrets
[1:51:50] but he who is of a faithful Spirit
[1:51:52] conceals a
[1:51:54] matter you know a Believer just you can
[1:51:56] you can actually hear things in this and
[1:51:58] there it just it stops with you all the
[1:51:59] gossip stops with you you don't no I
[1:52:00] don't need to talk about that it just
[1:52:02] stops with me I'm not going to go in and
[1:52:04] you hear what s did and you just carry
[1:52:06] on this nonsense just a a Son of God
[1:52:09] will just keep things a secret just keep
[1:52:11] it a secret keep those things a secret
[1:52:13] because if you keep them a secret they
[1:52:14] just they don't carry on past you that's
[1:52:17] right this is actually another one Peter
[1:52:19] saying for what glory is it if when
[1:52:22] you're buffeted when you've been you
[1:52:24] know got buffeted means you have got a
[1:52:28] uh
[1:52:29] uh yeah you have a recompense like a
[1:52:34] you've reaped what you've sewn something
[1:52:35] you've done wrong if you take it
[1:52:37] patiently yes I was wrong I deserve that
[1:52:39] you're right if you take it patiently he
[1:52:42] said but if you do well and you suffer
[1:52:45] for it and you take it patiently in
[1:52:47] other words don't say do you know what I
[1:52:48] did I did this and this and this with
[1:52:50] that person and then that person did
[1:52:51] this to me can you believe that they're
[1:52:53] like that's outrageous that person's so
[1:52:56] wrong to do that to you I
[1:52:59] know you're actually not supposed to say
[1:53:01] anything just take it patiently yeah
[1:53:04] yeah I was actually right they were
[1:53:05] totally wrong I've been done over here
[1:53:07] just he's saying just take it patiently
[1:53:10] he says because you've actually been
[1:53:12] called for that the same as the Lord
[1:53:13] when he when he went up he just faced
[1:53:14] all the accusers they said all these
[1:53:16] sorts of things he took it patiently and
[1:53:17] went and took the suffering went through
[1:53:19] it all he didn't say nothing about
[1:53:21] it some of things we just keep a
[1:53:24] secret last three
[1:53:28] slides no
[1:53:31] secrets but we've already talked about
[1:53:32] this but I just wanted to finish with
[1:53:34] these two because I believe we here
[1:53:36] don't want any secrets now do you know
[1:53:38] inside a door of the human heart we got
[1:53:40] little secret compartments oh we don't
[1:53:42] want to admit it but it's the truth sure
[1:53:43] we got little secret compartments yes
[1:53:45] sir we like to call we welcome in our
[1:53:47] heart but we don't want to make him our
[1:53:49] Lord
[1:53:50] we don't want to go to hell so we say
[1:53:52] Lord Jesus step into the door so I won't
[1:53:53] go to hell but you can't be my Lord you
[1:53:55] can't go into these other doors but
[1:53:58] here's us we must welcome him Lord come
[1:53:59] into my house if there's anything if
[1:54:01] there's anything in here that you want

[1:54:08] creator of heavens and earth has knocked

[1:54:41] you're going to live a Victorious
[1:54:43] Christian Life which I believe you all
[1:54:44] are and I want to encourage you don't
[1:54:46] you know I think God is more than able
[1:54:48] to we sometimes hear these things we
[1:54:51] think or maybe there's something that
[1:54:52] I'll never find out what it is I think
[1:54:53] God's more faithful than that I think
[1:54:55] he's more
[1:54:56] faithful you know if you don't if you
[1:54:58] can't find anything can't hear anything
[1:55:00] can't nothing there just then there's
[1:55:01] nothing there but if there's something
[1:55:02] there God will show it sometimes we go
[1:55:05] to searching because we hear these
[1:55:06] things we think right man I've got to
[1:55:07] search deeper there's got to be
[1:55:08] something somewhere and Satan can start
[1:55:10] to play in our mind and oh and he and he
[1:55:13] digging up something that maybe it's
[1:55:14] already been been made right or twisting
[1:55:16] around something God used to Satan used
[1:55:18] to tell me that I was blessing the Holy
[1:55:20] Ghost because when we were kids I was at
[1:55:22] 10 or 11 playing in the river I said to
[1:55:24] my brothers you know we we pretended we
[1:55:26] were baptizing I baptized you next one
[1:55:29] and then you know for months the devil
[1:55:31] said H look you blessed him the Holy
[1:55:32] Ghost cuz you were playing around with
[1:55:34] that you know there's no no hope for you
[1:55:36] for even for years I thought that cuz
[1:55:39] you did that wasn't the truth I was
[1:55:40] there was nothing in it you know we we
[1:55:42] weren't I wasn't making fun it was just
[1:55:43] something we'd seen at church you know
