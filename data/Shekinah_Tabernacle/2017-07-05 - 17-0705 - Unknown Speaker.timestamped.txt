[23:46] I mean Thank You musicians thank you
[23:48] brother Andy amen good evening everyone
[23:50] I mean good to have you one here on this
[23:52] very cold night I trust you all thought
[23:55] out amen so if you got your Bibles handy
[24:00] let's just turn to the Book of Psalms
[24:01] and then we're going to go to Ephesians
[24:05] chapter 1 so just a reminder we're going
[24:09] to have communion and foot washing this
[24:10] Sunday evening and we're gonna have the
[24:13] service around 3:30 so Psalms hundred
[24:18] and seven
[24:19] I love the Book of Psalms just something
[24:25] about the word you know it just gets
[24:26] better it doesn't matter how many times
[24:29] you read it just something just speaks
[24:31] to you a different way or means more to
[24:33] you or you know it's just such a
[24:35] blessing so Psalms 107 read from verse 1
[24:37] down to verse 8 I give thanks unto the
[24:40] Lord for he is good and as for His mercy
[24:43] endureth forever let the redeemed of the
[24:46] Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from
[24:49] the hand of the enemy and that is us
[24:51] we've been redeemed and gathered them
[24:53] out of the lands from the east and from
[24:55] the west and from the north and from the
[24:56] south they wandered in the wilderness in
[24:59] a solitary way they found no city to
[25:02] dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul
[25:04] fainted in them then they cried unto the
[25:06] Lord and their trouble and he delivered
[25:08] them out of their distress and he led
[25:11] them forth by the right way that they
[25:14] might go to a city of habitation Amy in
[25:17] the New Jerusalem oh that men would
[25:19] praise the Lord for His goodness and for
[25:22] his wonderful works to the children of
[25:25] men for he satisfies the longing soul
[25:28] and filleth the hungry soul with
[25:31] goodness hallelujah now Psalms I mean
[25:34] sorry
[25:35] Ephesians chapter 1 and we read a few
[25:40] verses feeds one and we reverse one down
[25:47] to verse seven I mean I love the book of
[25:50] Ephesians don't you
[25:52] I mean Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[25:54] by the will of God to the Saints Richat
[25:57] are at Ephesus to the faithful in Christ
[26:00] Jesus grace be to you and peace from God
[26:03] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[26:05] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[26:08] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[26:10] us with all spiritual blessings in
[26:13] heavenly places in Christ a gauzy
[26:15] according as he hath chosen us in him
[26:19] before the foundation of the world that
[26:22] we should be holy and without blame
[26:24] before him in love having predestinated
[26:27] us unto the adoption of children by
[26:30] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[26:34] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[26:36] of the glory of His grace and he hath
[26:39] made us accepted in the beloved in whom
[26:41] we have redemption through his blood the
[26:44] forgiveness of sins according to the
[26:47] riches of His grace wherein he hath
[26:49] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[26:51] prudence having made known unto us the
[26:54] mystery of his will according to the
[26:57] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[27:00] himself
[27:02] amen may the Lord bless us would you may
[27:04] have your seat now tonight I want to
[27:10] take a I want to speak a bit about
[27:13] adoption but I want to take a title if I
[27:16] could I'd like to take it from Ephesians
[27:19] 1 and verse 6 to the praise of the glory
[27:22] of His grace I mean so we read there in
[27:25] in Psalms hundred and seven you know
[27:29] that the redeemed of the Lord you know
[27:32] it said let the redeemed of the Lord say
[27:35] so whom he hath redeemed from the hand
[27:39] of the enemy we understand from the
[27:42] reading of Scripture and from you know
[27:44] from the message of the hour that truly
[27:47] the redeemed to be redeemed us to be as
[27:49] to be restored back to our original
[27:52] condition that's what it means to be
[27:54] redeemed
[27:55] it's as if that something was your
[27:57] property and it was stolen or you lost
[28:00] it but then you searched around and you
[28:02] found it and if it was stolen and sold
[28:05] to some
[28:05] one else then you would have to buy it
[28:07] back and then it became yours and it
[28:09] came back to its original condition and
[28:11] that's what it means to be redeemed now
[28:13] we understand from the scripture that
[28:16] before there was a son before there was
[28:18] a star or a molecule or anything we were
[28:21] in God's thinking before the foundation
[28:23] of the world and in his great thinking
[28:25] he slew the land before the foundation
[28:27] of the world and so already a way had
[28:30] been made for redemption even before was
[28:32] manifested in time and we read there in
[28:35] Ephesians chapter 1 that we are
[28:37] predestinated unto the adoption of
[28:40] children by Jesus Christ to himself so
[28:44] and then we even read before that that
[28:46] we were that we were chosen according as
[28:50] he hath chosen us in him before the
[28:52] foundation of the world that we should
[28:55] be holy and without blame before him in
[28:57] love so when we became a believer you
[29:01] know it wasn't a haphazard thing when
[29:03] God began to call us it wasn't just some
[29:06] some stab in the dark that we were
[29:08] trying to find your peace of trying to
[29:10] find a religion of trying to find a
[29:12] different way of life but it was God
[29:14] calling us it was God drawing us
[29:17] hallelujah amen so when you're like
[29:20] brother Graham says very simply he says
[29:22] he says there's a deep call to the deep
[29:25] and he said if there's that there's a
[29:26] longing in here it's because there's
[29:29] something somewhere calling drawing that
[29:31] longing there's that there's a deep
[29:33] calling to the deep and he says that
[29:35] they had to be at God somewhere an
[29:37] orifice for you to have a longing for
[29:39] that God hallelujah so before there was
[29:42] a longing here there was a God to
[29:44] fulfill that longing hallelujah so
[29:47] that's a glorious thing now we read here
[29:50] that we are predestinated met now notice
[29:52] everything about our Christian walk is
[29:54] for the praise of his glory I mean so
[29:58] everything is done for us as to the
[30:00] praise of his glory so in order you know
[30:03] when we gather you just think about when
[30:05] we gather around the throne that day
[30:07] none of us are going to be standing
[30:09] there in eternity
[30:10] saying praise God my mother and daddy
[30:14] had it that's why I'm here
[30:15] well praise God you know it was just a
[30:18] religion
[30:19] so idea and that's why I'm here it will
[30:20] not be that way it'll be thank you Lord
[30:23] I was lost but then I became found I
[30:25] mean I was wandering in darkness and sin
[30:28] and then you found me a meant you became
[30:31] a reality to me I was sick and then you
[30:33] healed me I mean I was I was lost I was
[30:36] in darkness I was wandering around in
[30:39] darkness and then you found me I'm in my
[30:41] you set me on the right path hallelujah
[30:44] you revealed yourself to me and the ages
[30:47] living in you gave me overcoming power
[30:49] Amen you gave me the faith to rise up
[30:52] above this world hallelujah you placed
[30:55] me in your and yourself Amen you placed
[30:58] me in the body of Christ hallelujah we
[31:00] can have the glorious time I mean
[31:03] thinking about someone who's done so
[31:04] much for us you think about a natural
[31:06] person I mean if you're in debt up to
[31:08] your eyeballs or you know something you
[31:10] could you know if you were facing a
[31:12] firing squad or the electric chair and
[31:15] then someone stepped in and just settled
[31:17] the whole thing and you walked out free
[31:19] you would want to go find that person
[31:20] you'd want to go and brace that person
[31:23] and you'd want to tell them how much you
[31:25] appreciate them times that by Julian
[31:27] billion billion infinities I mean
[31:29] helping worse like we were around the
[31:31] throne Lord you found me I couldn't save
[31:33] myself I couldn't redeem myself I mean I
[31:36] couldn't even be a Christian myself and
[31:38] yet then you came
[31:40] hallelujah then you revealed yourself to
[31:42] me and that's why it's such a blessed
[31:44] thing if there's something in here that
[31:46] says this must be more to life than this
[31:49] I'm not satisfied with with jobs or
[31:53] place the nice things or you know
[31:55] there's got to be more to life your than
[31:57] Joe there's going to be a real peace is
[31:59] going to be a real life if you have that
[32:01] in you you're a blessed person I mean
[32:03] because if there's that in you then
[32:05] there's that there's that to respond and
[32:07] if there's a if there's a a desire for
[32:09] real life is real life to have amen
[32:12] eternal life I might get into that on
[32:14] Sunday cuz I think I'll be thinking
[32:16] through the week what is life what is
[32:19] life is it you know is good life good
[32:24] good situation and in bad life is having
[32:27] bad situations or you know what is life
[32:30] because John says and
[32:33] first job that this worked on he said
[32:36] eternal life which was in the bosom of
[32:38] the Father we held him we beheld him
[32:41] life amen and in the same day life has
[32:45] come again life has been restored and
[32:48] we've handled the word of life
[32:50] hallelujah so you know life is a very
[32:53] different kind of thing but anyway he's
[32:56] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[32:58] children now I just want to break down a
[33:01] few things I've been listening to the
[33:03] adoption series and it's amazing brother
[33:06] branham no this is just me
[33:07] this is what he pens it down to and this
[33:10] is really want to get to he pens it down
[33:12] to well there's just me you have to have
[33:15] confidence the one that's leading you
[33:17] you have to have confidence the one
[33:19] that's leading you ain't meant and
[33:21] you've got to understand that the one
[33:23] that's leading you has a far greater
[33:25] intelligence and wisdom than you do amen
[33:29] it's amazing the Prophet he says really
[33:31] okay I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read
[33:34] you a quote and you'll think this is
[33:35] just funny but I was listening to this
[33:38] driving home the other day I thought
[33:41] this is so profound
[33:42] now he's talking about a pig in a pig
[33:44] pen he's comparing it to humanity
[33:46] he says God by his election grace called
[33:50] you God by his election grace sanctified
[33:53] you colu you God by his election grace
[33:56] and his power baptized you and put you
[33:58] into this land of rest which is the Holy
[34:01] Ghost which they which have entered into
[34:04] this rest have cease from their going
[34:06] astray
[34:07] hallelujah Amen they remember a prophet
[34:10] when he speaks he says sings very
[34:12] deliberately there's a reason why he
[34:15] sees things a certain way he's just not
[34:17] throwing words out there to excite
[34:18] people but prophets say things in
[34:20] specific ways you see the even the
[34:23] Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ how he
[34:26] started with the Beatitudes he began to
[34:28] unfold himself down through there was a
[34:30] reason why he preached things in a
[34:31] certain order the same thing with the
[34:33] Apostle Paul the same thing with the
[34:35] Ministry of brother Branham how would
[34:37] unfolded there's a reason for it so
[34:39] there's a reason why things are spoken
[34:41] in such a way they ceased from their
[34:43] works like God did from hers they have
[34:46] unspeakable and full of glory the tree
[34:49] of life is blooming in them they have
[34:51] long-suffering gentle goodness patience
[34:54] made faith faith meekness gentleness and
[34:56] so forth
[34:57] The Tree of Life is blooming in them
[34:59] because their hope is anchored in Christ
[35:01] Jesus this is where the hope is anchored
[35:03] remember I said that is that yet so
[35:06] forgive me we read that first put it can
[35:10] you put that verse up there just leave
[35:11] it Ephesians 1:5 no no can you put up
[35:14] four and five in there because I want to
[35:17] these are the two these are the two
[35:19] take-home thoughts you'd have confidence
[35:23] according as he has chosen us in him
[35:25] before the foundation of the world so
[35:27] before anything you were chosen in him
[35:29] and if there's a longing in here it
[35:31] means you were chosen in him if you want
[35:33] more than just the natural life and you
[35:35] want to meet who made me where did I
[35:37] come from it's because it's calling you
[35:39] I mean that you should be holy and
[35:41] without blame before him and love this
[35:44] is what God purposed and what God
[35:46] purposes happens I mean it never you
[35:49] know we have plans and we say we're
[35:51] going to do certain things in it can
[35:52] maybe it doesn't work out but when God
[35:54] sees things they always work out
[35:56] hallelujah I mean so that means I have
[35:59] chosen in him before the foundation of
[36:01] world that I should be wholly without
[36:03] blame before him and love that means the
[36:05] devil can't blame me for anything I mean
[36:07] because the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:08] cleanses me from all sin so we found in
[36:10] him before him in love okay love divine
[36:14] love governs the Christian life right
[36:17] and having predestinated us unto the
[36:21] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[36:23] himself according to the good pleasure
[36:25] of his will so we found without blame
[36:27] before him and love right and then we're
[36:30] predestinate so our destination is
[36:32] determined that we would be adopted but
[36:35] in the Bible it means a placing of a
[36:36] child the placing of a son in the
[36:39] household right so we are predestinate
[36:41] to be placed in the body where we meet
[36:43] to be hallelujah so our destination has
[36:47] been determined I mean we will come to
[36:50] our adoption to wit the change in the
[36:52] body Alleluia
[36:54] so now it's in love but then the second
[36:57] point is now so the whole the whole
[37:00] Christian walk is governed by divine
[37:02] love and you have to have confidence
[37:04] down the one that's leading you okay so
[37:08] and as I said the third thing is if
[37:10] we're gonna have three points we'll have
[37:11] three points tonight you got to
[37:13] understand his intelligence it's greater
[37:16] his ways he says my ways are greater
[37:18] than your ways my thoughts are greater
[37:21] than your thoughts is what God says in
[37:22] his Bible see saying that my
[37:24] intelligence is far supreme to how you
[37:27] could think I mean he says he said you
[37:30] know the Bible says that the wisdom of
[37:32] God is foolish to man but the wisdom of
[37:35] man is foolish to God so what we think
[37:38] is great and wisdom God says that's
[37:39] foolish yeah hallelujah
[37:41] because this thinking is so much greater
[37:43] than ours okay now where was I so
[37:47] there's those three things you can leave
[37:48] that up there if you wish bearing
[37:51] witness of the Holy Ghost bearing record
[37:53] with signs and wonders following the
[37:55] believers these signs shall follow them
[37:57] that believe as they go along they'll
[37:59] heal the sick they'll cast out devils
[38:01] I'll speak with tongues see visions and
[38:03] they walk with God they talk with God
[38:06] no devil can move them their steadfast
[38:08] looking for forgetting those things in
[38:11] the past they press on towards the mark
[38:13] of the high calling in Christ Jesus
[38:14] there they are there they are that's
[38:17] that's pardon me that church it says how
[38:20] do you get there you can't say well Lord
[38:22] do you know one day I started smoking
[38:24] cigarettes and I fell then I thought I'd
[38:26] oh no no no he says predestination he
[38:29] calls us and when we followed him as
[38:32] when we say God we were lost and undone
[38:35] we didn't even have a mind to save
[38:37] oneself we have a nature of a pig I hope
[38:41] this doesn't stand in anyone's feet but
[38:43] now I'll just read this new play I think
[38:46] it's funny but he's saying very profound
[38:47] things in this to me okay we was a
[38:50] nature of a pig we were pigs to begin
[38:53] with so he had a fallen nature when
[38:55] we're born that's what he say you go out
[38:57] to a Pigpen and you look at an old sow
[39:00] and say now lookie here old gal I want
[39:03] to tell you something it's wrong for you
[39:05] to drink slop
[39:06] she'd say oink oink see now that's as
[39:09] much as you have a saving your own self
[39:11] that's exactly you say lady shouldn't
[39:13] we're closed on that you should dress
[39:15] neatly you should do this you shouldn't
[39:17] go to this you should you should not
[39:19] have these car parties you shouldn't
[39:20] smoke cigarettes you shouldn't do this
[39:22] Messer you shouldn't carry on he'd say I
[39:24] think I belong to the oink-oink
[39:26] uh-huh that's just as much as they know
[39:29] then that sounds funny doesn't it wait
[39:32] hold on well I know well I'll tell you
[39:36] I'll let you know I'm just as good as
[39:38] you are oink oink
[39:40] see they reject the leadership of the
[39:42] holy ghost for the Bible said that if
[39:44] you love the world of things of the
[39:45] world the love of God is not even in you
[39:47] now when I heard that the first time I
[39:49] laughed for these guys I'm I belong the
[39:52] ointment cause he's saying it's a man
[39:53] talking to a pig but what he's saying is
[39:56] his God comes to the Pigpen which is
[39:58] this world and he looks down at humanity
[40:01] and he's and he's actually trying to
[40:03] tell you there's a better way to look
[40:05] there's a higher way of living you don't
[40:08] have to live in this slop you don't have
[40:10] to eat the scraps from from the table of
[40:12] the world you know mine tell you think
[40:14] of a farmer as fast smart even the
[40:16] dumbest farmer is way smarter than a pig
[40:19] you can take some ignorant guy who can't
[40:22] read or write write as our name he is
[40:24] far more intelligent than a pig all the
[40:27] pig knows how to do is eat right roll
[40:30] around in the mud when they're hot have
[40:32] asleep you know we lived we lived for a
[40:34] couple years my parents lived outside of
[40:36] Cambridge on this they rented this place
[40:39] but was in the country and one Christmas
[40:42] holidays I was sleeping in a tent on the
[40:43] lawn because there's no room in the
[40:45] house and over the fence there was this
[40:47] big fat couldn t Cooney pick and there
[40:49] were three sheep and the noise as I
[40:51] heard from that pig it just walked
[40:53] around this is literally all it did have
[40:55] you've seen a pig just all day walking
[40:57] eating eating walking eating just just
[41:01] unstoppable and then it would find its
[41:04] place under the trees it just rolled
[41:06] laughing it didn't even need to kind of
[41:08] fall over it just kind of rolled and it
[41:10] was on its side and then roll back up
[41:12] and it kept eating and that's all it did
[41:16] that sounds ridiculous doesn't it do you
[41:19] think what a silly pig doing that kind
[41:21] of thing but here's the stinger the this
[41:24] is how God sees us
[41:27] without him because we're just wandering
[41:29] around in our little paddock or just
[41:32] eating trying to find something to eat
[41:34] find somewhere comfortable to live you
[41:37] know just walking around being basically
[41:39] an animal but then he comes to the fence
[41:42] he says now mr. wink like this has been
[41:46] away he's showing that you say it's a
[41:49] silly story now it's not because God's
[41:51] intelligence it's greater than a pig's
[41:53] intelligence he's saying if and he's and
[41:56] he's to me he's going along those lines
[41:58] is because he says straight up as I said
[42:01] he says they reject the leadership of
[42:02] the Holy Ghost so he's saying the Holy
[42:04] Ghost comes down to them this is how God
[42:06] sees them just like a pig in a pig sty
[42:08] but the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[42:11] wants to take them take us lift us up
[42:14] out of the pig sty
[42:15] amen give us a new mind a new way of
[42:17] thinking
[42:18] Alleluia a new life and you I mean that
[42:21] a fallen nature is not in you anymore
[42:23] but the nature of God himself the very
[42:25] life of God Himself comes unto you I
[42:28] mean then you stand on your feet and you
[42:30] don't go one going anymore I mean you
[42:33] don't live that kind of life anymore but
[42:35] the same intelligence that's in the
[42:37] farmer comes unto you Alleluia so the
[42:40] same same thinking the same way that God
[42:42] views things and those things you begin
[42:44] to do hallelujah amen they reject the
[42:49] leadership of the Holy Ghost for the
[42:50] Bible said if you love the world or the
[42:51] things the world the love of God is not
[42:53] even in you I mean that's an that's an
[42:58] um that's an adoption part - 1960 so we
[43:03] read now and I won't be too long though
[43:06] right there in the scripture in
[43:07] Ephesians 1:5 so now if that pig as I've
[43:12] said before us like a shepherd he is our
[43:14] Shepherd it says Jesus is I'm the great
[43:16] Shepherd now if that sheep understands
[43:20] that this this thing on two legs because
[43:22] the Sheep was just like a you know when
[43:24] it comes to intelligence a sheep is not
[43:26] a smart thing a sheep has you know you
[43:28] drive along you see them on the hills
[43:30] and they're running along and well you
[43:33] know and I just think if there are some
[43:34] Wolf's or any kind of kind of predator
[43:38] man yeah man you
[43:39] have a pedicure chic and you look after
[43:41] those sheep you just eat one at a time
[43:43] you'll live like a king because they
[43:45] can't get away they have no defense I
[43:47] mean they're dominant animals sometimes
[43:50] they get caught in the bushes with their
[43:52] wool if they're as helpless as helpless
[43:53] can be and God God sees this is how our
[43:57] condition is right we are sheep and
[43:59] we've all gone astray the bible says but
[44:01] here's the Shepherd of our souls so if
[44:04] we've gone wayward then he is not
[44:06] satisfied with just ninety and nine
[44:07] sheep and the sheep and the Sheep pen
[44:09] but he goes out and finds that one
[44:12] hallelujah and it should be the same
[44:14] heart should be in us I mean we
[44:17] shouldn't be satisfied with well this
[44:19] person saved will this person say what
[44:21] about some sheep that's gone astray I
[44:24] mean so like so if the sheep now it's
[44:28] like David looking after sheep if those
[44:30] sheep was smart I'd say I'm going to
[44:31] stay close to him not because he just
[44:34] plays a hot real good but I recognize
[44:37] he's going to slingshot Amen he can he
[44:40] can if he's killed the line and he
[44:42] killed a bear he can take care of me
[44:44] right and then a shepherd can see
[44:47] further and higher than where the sheep
[44:50] are because the sheep was just down here
[44:52] and if the grass is a bit long they're
[44:54] not going to see too good but a ship is
[44:56] standing up he can scan around he's got
[44:59] this perception you know a prey item
[45:02] they have their eyes on the side of
[45:03] their head they don't have good depth
[45:05] perception they can look around but they
[45:07] can't tell because if you don't get
[45:09] depth perception you can't tell how far
[45:11] away things are you follow me but uh but
[45:15] a shepherd with his eyes here they have
[45:17] a better measure of distance so they can
[45:19] see the enemies this far away or he's
[45:21] right here the Sheep is just going bad
[45:23] just walking along oh he's there are no
[45:25] he's far away I'm fine but he can be
[45:27] right there you following me right so
[45:30] sheep needs to understand this Shepherd
[45:33] has greater intelligence than me I can't
[45:36] even think like him sheep can't think
[45:39] like us I know this is very basic we got
[45:42] to think about it a sheep cannot think
[45:44] human thoughts they cannot think I
[45:47] wonder what the wind is going to do
[45:48] tomorrow I wonder if I should move to
[45:51] this other paddock or I wonder if I need
[45:53] to put food
[45:53] on this paddock but I wonder if I need
[45:55] to dag these sheep or I wonder when
[45:57] lambing season is going to come if I
[45:59] need to move the separate they use in
[46:01] the and the RAM so you know he can't
[46:03] think like that I wonder if I need to
[46:05] get the shearing gang in next week and
[46:06] you know sheep don't think like that
[46:08] they walk along and they hate their eat
[46:11] their grass and do sheep thinks it's the
[46:14] same thing with us now I'm saying these
[46:18] things it's because you've got to
[46:19] recognize we are sheep but God doesn't
[46:23] want to keep us as as as separate from
[46:26] him right he wants to lift us up by the
[46:29] blood of Jesus Christ so it says in the
[46:31] Bible where joint heirs with Christ I
[46:33] mean that means him where he is his
[46:36] level we become the same as him that's a
[46:39] joint heir right so he wants to take us
[46:41] from that kind of thinking human
[46:43] thinking which is way down here and his
[46:46] thoughts away up here it was elevate our
[46:48] thinking's as thinking in our thinking
[46:50] of the same Amen because adoption as I
[46:54] said is the placing now if the sheep has
[46:58] confidence in the shepherd they'll stay
[46:59] by the shepherd they won't try and fight
[47:01] their own battles right they won't try
[47:04] and sort out their own problems they'll
[47:06] go straight to the shepherd if they're
[47:08] sick or they have another sheep that's
[47:09] sick they'll take that sheep and they'll
[47:11] take it to the Shepherd because in a
[47:13] script bag he's got the honey to put on
[47:15] the rock I mean he's got one he's got
[47:18] the medicine and if there's a predator
[47:19] around they don't feel too safe I mean
[47:22] they'll go to the you know they'll go to
[47:23] the Shepherd because he's got stones to
[47:25] kill the enemy Alleluia
[47:28] but if the Sheep does not have
[47:29] confidence in the shepherd they'll try
[47:31] and sort it out themselves and it's the
[47:33] same thing with us as I said you've got
[47:35] to have confidence and the one that's
[47:37] leading you and the one that's leading
[47:39] us is the Holy Ghost right amen so now
[47:45] let's go to Galatians 4 and we're going
[47:48] to read a bit about adoption
[47:55] but before we read that before we read
[48:00] that I want to really quote from a
[48:02] position of a believer in Christ I just
[48:05] like this and if you plant and if you
[48:07] plant and this little tree begins to
[48:09] draw it just drinks till it can't drink
[48:12] no more
[48:12] then drink more than that and it pushes
[48:14] out then move more and more fruit
[48:17] bushels and bushels of oranges and when
[48:20] a man comes into Christ it doesn't first
[48:23] get your oranges you get the tree and
[48:26] the tree is planted in Christ Jesus the
[48:29] inexhaustible fountain of life and in
[48:31] every and and everything that a believer
[48:34] has has to do after he's placed in
[48:37] Christ Jesus everything he has need of
[48:39] in this earthly journey is given to him
[48:42] when he's placed in Christ and all he
[48:44] has to do is drink and drink and push
[48:46] out and drink until every fruit of the
[48:49] Spirit every gift of the Spirit
[48:50] everything that's in Christ Jesus that
[48:52] belongs to you will be in you for the
[48:55] entire journey and I read that because
[48:59] you've got to understand everything we
[49:00] have need overs in him so if you stay
[49:02] close to him I mean if you have
[49:04] confidence in him guiding you then
[49:06] you'll get what you need I mean but
[49:09] that's why I believe just spend time in
[49:11] the word spend time in prayer just drink
[49:13] drink from the fountain and drink
[49:15] strength from the fountain Alleluia and
[49:18] just push out you know a tree has to
[49:21] drink more water than it needs in order
[49:22] to grow
[49:23] amen it's like a child if you just give
[49:26] it if you give it exactly the amount of
[49:28] food it needs to survive it's not going
[49:30] to grow too well amen but if you give it
[49:33] more food it'll grow hallelujah so
[49:36] that's why we need a full diet of this
[49:39] word I mean we need a full course I just
[49:43] don't want it on tray I don't want some
[49:45] garnish hello
[49:48] amen I want the whole thing and the
[49:51] garnish - Galatians 4 and 1 it's got
[49:55] equations 4 and 1 and we read down to
[49:58] verse 6 he says now I say that an ear
[50:06] as long as he is a child differeth
[50:09] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[50:11] of all she's saying in ear so a child
[50:14] that's born into the family though he is
[50:16] part of the family he is not different
[50:19] from a servant at that point but he is
[50:22] under tutors and governors until the
[50:24] time appointed of the Father even so we
[50:26] when we were children were in bondage
[50:29] under the elements of the world but when
[50:31] the fullness of the time was come God
[50:33] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[50:36] under the law to redeem them that were
[50:39] under the law that we might receive the
[50:41] adoption or placing of sons and because
[50:45] he our sons so notice he says because
[50:48] he's not well I should just read it
[50:50] because she are sons god sent forth the
[50:53] spirit of his son into your hearts
[50:54] crying ever father or my father my
[50:57] father so you did not become when you
[51:00] received the Spirit who's got the Spirit
[51:02] of the Lord on them the Living God comes
[51:04] and dwells in you amen that's it he's
[51:07] saying here you do not become a son or a
[51:09] daughter of God when God comes and
[51:11] dwells on you he says because you are
[51:13] one of them one of them one of them amen
[51:17] because you are one of them he comes and
[51:20] lives in you I mean because remember God
[51:22] is searching over the earth to find his
[51:25] children and when he finds us children
[51:27] he lays claim on his children amen he
[51:30] says this one's mine in any place claim
[51:32] on them because he fills them with this
[51:34] with a spirit amen he died on Calvary in
[51:37] order to claim you hallelujah amen so
[51:41] that's why he says now that we're under
[51:43] the bondage of the elements of the world
[51:45] amen it was a once upon a time we were
[51:47] slaves to the world
[51:48] we're slaves to our society to our
[51:51] culture to our first birth our first way
[51:55] of thinking amen but then God came so we
[51:59] were sheep we were pigs in the Pigpen
[52:01] we're under the elements of the elements
[52:04] of the Pigpen but then the farmer came
[52:07] hallelujah and he spoke a word into this
[52:11] earth he following me I don't care if
[52:14] you've heard it a million times getting
[52:15] here two million and one it does your
[52:17] good I mean so now and then say
[52:19] came this way that's why it's so amazing
[52:22] the prophet's ministry it's not william
[52:24] branham it's not William Brennan's
[52:26] ministry it's God steps into the vessel
[52:29] and speaks it's like Paul writing the
[52:31] epistles that's not Paul writing that's
[52:34] God writing it wasn't Moses writing
[52:37] Genesis God wrote Genesis through Moses
[52:39] wasn't jeremiah writing it was God
[52:42] writing through Jeremiah
[52:43] it wasn't the Sam's were not David they
[52:45] were God through David all the way down
[52:47] through the Bible this is God riding
[52:49] through human scribes amen so it's not
[52:53] it's not man it's not man's doing it's
[52:55] God's doing so he's saying because you
[52:57] were this way but then God sent forth
[52:59] his son I'm so glad he did I mean he was
[53:02] born into the human race became our
[53:04] kinsman amen to redeem them there under
[53:07] the law we were under the law but he
[53:09] came to redeem us rendre a mention we're
[53:11] not under the penalty of death anymore
[53:13] hallelujah but to restore us back to our
[53:15] original possession hallelujah this
[53:18] means something to me
[53:19] I meant and because I mean that we might
[53:22] receive the placing now Adam before the
[53:26] fall was in his position as God over the
[53:29] earth hallelujah
[53:31] he had dominion god created all things
[53:34] he made he made man as a spirit man made
[53:37] it him in His image he said have
[53:39] dominion over the earth and he put that
[53:41] spirit man into a body called Adam
[53:45] hallelujah and then he was God over the
[53:47] earth he was in his position right and
[53:50] then so now God is calling now that he's
[53:53] went when the fall came he says I'll not
[53:55] leave my children this way under the
[53:57] elements of the world but I will redeem
[53:59] them back to the way back when they have
[54:02] a what they fell from hallelujah amen so
[54:05] everything Adam lost now the position
[54:08] Adam was in has the man and woman have
[54:11] to be restored back to that position I
[54:13] mean that's why the second Adam when he
[54:16] came Jesus Christ he had dominion over
[54:17] nature hid dominion over all the devils
[54:20] hallelujah everything that could be
[54:23] named or his name must bow to the name
[54:26] of Jesus Christ he proved that I am I am
[54:29] in my position hallelujah I have
[54:32] dominion
[54:33] Adam had dominion he proved it right but
[54:36] that was a lived example to show you
[54:39] this is what I'm going to make you
[54:41] hallelujah and that's why brother
[54:43] Branham Winnie
[54:44] you should go listen to the rising of
[54:46] the Sun hallelujah I love that sermon I
[54:49] love that message is more than just a
[54:51] more than just an Easter message but he
[54:53] takes the he takes from Leviticus and he
[54:56] takes about the wave sheaf offering Allu
[54:59] yeah and what they did is they had a
[55:01] field of corn or or or barley whatever
[55:03] it was and they would cut down the
[55:06] mature part of the field because because
[55:09] grain if you look at a field it doesn't
[55:11] grow doesn't mature the same level just
[55:14] like the believer hallelujah but we're
[55:17] growing that's the main thing as long as
[55:19] you're growing and so it cuts down the
[55:21] mature part and the priest would wave it
[55:23] before the Lord giving thanks saying
[55:26] thank you Lord the rest of the field
[55:28] will become like this hallelujah and
[55:30] then Jesus was the mature part of the
[55:32] field I mean the fullness of God it
[55:35] boldly came into wealth in a man he has
[55:37] cut down at Calvary waves before the
[55:39] Lord hallelujah amen at a Thanksgiving
[55:42] to God saying your people will come
[55:45] forth like this and then your people
[55:47] will be made in this image your people
[55:49] will live the same kind of life your
[55:50] people will have the same nature
[55:52] hallelujah
[55:54] then brother Brahim says now it's the
[55:56] rising of the Sun again the Esso in has
[55:59] risen Jesus Christ he says in this day
[56:02] the Son of Man Jesus Christ will be
[56:04] revealed again wholly in Luke 17 30 and
[56:07] he and it was shown year after year
[56:10] message after message was shown in his
[56:12] ministry he says now what is this
[56:15] it's that quickening power Hurley the
[56:17] life of God manifested the light of God
[56:20] being displayed again they said now this
[56:22] this life is being waved before a
[56:24] generation hallelujah and we behold that
[56:27] we're in the field member the earth
[56:28] earth is the field
[56:30] hallelujah and this and his weeds and
[56:32] all kinds of crazy stuff but this week
[56:34] in the field
[56:35] amen as long as your wheat and you look
[56:37] up and you see a priest hallelujah
[56:39] waving that and there's something and
[56:41] you say I'm going to be I'm going to
[56:43] come forth I mean
[56:44] because the same life that was in him as
[56:46] in me Polly I may be green it may be
[56:48] this big it doesn't matter him in the
[56:50] field
[56:50] I mean I'm growing into his image
[56:52] hallelujah and that was God promising
[56:55] you see this you see this life
[56:58] hallelujah
[56:59] this will manifest I mean this will be
[57:01] reproduced into people hallelujah so
[57:05] Adam was in his position adopted placed
[57:08] in his position over the earth amen and
[57:11] it'd be the same thing must happen to us
[57:13] amen
[57:14] the same thing must happen remember it's
[57:16] not you can that's doing it to searle
[57:18] life I trust there's a life in you
[57:21] partly because if there's that life and
[57:23] you you'll come to your you'll come to
[57:25] your adoption but you've got to remember
[57:27] you say well I don't know what it means
[57:30] to be placed in the body I'll tell you
[57:32] you'll find yourself in that position
[57:33] before you even realize it
[57:36] amen and you've got to recognize that's
[57:38] like kale you know and the Old Testament
[57:41] yeah we've got heaps of time and the Old
[57:43] Testament you know here was here was
[57:46] Israel and now we're going to come and
[57:48] be placed in the promised land certain
[57:51] certain tribes were placed in different
[57:53] places and the and the we know the
[57:55] promised land was a shadow of us being
[57:58] placed in the Holy Ghost in the New
[58:00] Testament because that was their
[58:01] inheritance right and so here comes
[58:03] Caleb now remember he he crosses Jordan
[58:08] he's been waiting 40 years he's 80 years
[58:11] old girl whatever crosses Jordan
[58:13] hallelujah 40 years ago I saw my my
[58:17] adoption I saw my resurrection mountain
[58:20] he crosses Jordan he defeats every enemy
[58:23] he comes against poly he comes as he's
[58:26] 84 years old he comes to Joshua he says
[58:29] I've been fighting how lujah remember he
[58:32] had the power he had the overcoming
[58:34] power he had the victory when he crossed
[58:37] Jordan he had the victory when he saw
[58:39] the land forty years before I say he had
[58:41] the victory when he came out of the came
[58:43] out of Egypt under the shed blood parlor
[58:46] he had the victory when he crossed the
[58:47] Red Sea he had confidence and who was
[58:50] I mean he knew it wasn't Moses speaking
[58:52] he knew it was God
[58:54] I mean that's why he followed that word
[58:56] as close as he could
[58:57] hallelujah something anchored in his
[58:59] soul this is going to take me in amen
[59:02] and that was now that was now has leader
[59:04] it wasn't Moses as God and Moses Ali
[59:07] wasn't the 80 year old man who to win
[59:10] unto Egypt as God in a man I'm gonna
[59:12] take my children they were under that
[59:14] they were they were under the bondage of
[59:17] the world the elements of the world I'm
[59:19] not gonna leave them there I'm gonna
[59:21] place them in their land place them in
[59:23] their inheritance amen so remember I
[59:25] said you could have confidence the one
[59:26] that that's leading you and because
[59:28] Caleb and Joshua there were other people
[59:30] corn dazed and raised up Balaam came out
[59:33] of nowhere did the things they did they
[59:35] stuck to thanks doc right by Moses
[59:37] because I knew here was here was God in
[59:40] this man amen the Bible says they were
[59:43] of a different spirit than the other
[59:45] ones I mention that being personally led
[59:48] by the one that was in Moses was
[59:50] personally leading them and you got to
[59:53] have confidence who's leading you amen
[59:56] because if you have confidence the one
[59:58] that's leading you you're going to get
[59:59] there because we're found as we read in
[1:00:02] Ephesians found in him in love without
[1:00:04] blame Amen
[1:00:05] so now love governing your walk but then
[1:00:08] you've got to have confidence the work
[1:00:10] he started he's going to perfect he's
[1:00:12] going to finish hallelujah so here he
[1:00:15] was sorry I need a bit of this here he
[1:00:20] was I'm 84 years old you gotta read it
[1:00:23] I'm 84 years old you know I'm as strong
[1:00:25] as I wasn't there I left Egypt give me
[1:00:28] this mountain so here he comes he's
[1:00:30] coming because he's going to be placed
[1:00:31] in the land under the ministry of Joshua
[1:00:33] I mean we've received a Joshua ministry
[1:00:35] in this day this means that you'll place
[1:00:37] you remember this message has a life of
[1:00:40] its own this Bible has a life of its own
[1:00:43] yes this is not ink on paper only this
[1:00:48] is the mind of everything God has has
[1:00:49] been recorded in this word I mean when
[1:00:52] you open this you're reading God and
[1:00:53] printful think about hallelujah God has
[1:00:58] revealed in this word and to hearing
[1:01:00] what so he says give me my give me my
[1:01:02] placing in the body
[1:01:04] hee hee oh he didn't start overcoming
[1:01:06] when he was placed
[1:01:07] he was overcoming before he was play he
[1:01:10] following me everything you have needed
[1:01:12] her so I read that quote from the
[1:01:13] position of the believer in Christ
[1:01:15] everything you have nito for your
[1:01:16] earthly journey is in you a man when you
[1:01:19] receive the Holy Ghost it just got a
[1:01:20] grown mature hallelujah so now we have
[1:01:26] to have confidence they had confidence
[1:01:28] in their leader which was not Moses he
[1:01:30] was what he was but it was God leading
[1:01:32] Moses right so they had confidence now
[1:01:36] that he would take them all the way we
[1:01:39] are more than able and then Moses was
[1:01:42] taken off the seat and to show to Caleb
[1:01:45] and the others that it's not just the
[1:01:47] man versus spirit leading the man he
[1:01:50] took Moses off the scene he brought just
[1:01:52] sure to come and finish the part of the
[1:01:54] work to place them in the land but the
[1:01:56] same God that was leading Moses lead
[1:01:58] lead Joshua hallelujah and Caleb got his
[1:02:05] adoption now you have to have let's go
[1:02:11] to Romans 8 22 and 23 just want to read
[1:02:16] this as well because the fullness of the
[1:02:18] adoption which will read as what we've
[1:02:23] been looking for that we could spend
[1:02:26] more time on that we'll go to Romans 8
[1:02:27] 22 and 23 for we know that the whole
[1:02:33] creation groaneth and travaileth and
[1:02:36] painting together until now all of
[1:02:38] nature is groaning thirsty yo they're
[1:02:42] hungry for life they know you know the
[1:02:44] earth is fallen and not only they but
[1:02:47] ourselves also which had the firstfruits
[1:02:51] of the Spirit even we ourselves groan
[1:02:53] within ourselves waiting for the
[1:02:55] adoption to wit the redemption of our
[1:02:58] body and this way you know like Abraham
[1:03:01] he said I'm a pilgrim and a stranger he
[1:03:03] wasn't satisfied with this with this
[1:03:06] earthly journey he knew there was a city
[1:03:08] he was going to dwell in he was looking
[1:03:10] for that city
[1:03:11] he was even walking where that city was
[1:03:13] going to come down on the New Jerusalem
[1:03:14] there was something in him saying this
[1:03:16] mortal
[1:03:17] from this I'm not satisfied with justice
[1:03:19] I'm looking for a city and he was
[1:03:22] looking for the city because he meant
[1:03:24] the king of the city he met Malka sonic
[1:03:26] and brother Brad was standing 1965 and
[1:03:29] he said to the question who is this
[1:03:32] melchizedek he didn't say who was
[1:03:34] melchizedek who was this one and he
[1:03:37] showed Jesus Christ as Melchizedek they
[1:03:39] said now that same one is present
[1:03:41] howling supernaturally proved he's the
[1:03:43] high priest and touched by the feeling
[1:03:45] of your infirmity and God came down
[1:03:46] supernaturally to prove what the Prophet
[1:03:49] said was true I mean I am Melchizedek
[1:03:51] Jesus and I'm present Amen so therefore
[1:03:54] if we have met the author of the word
[1:03:57] Amen if we've met Jesus Christ who's met
[1:04:01] Jesus Christ you are the heaven heaven I
[1:04:03] trust you have if you have you met Malka
[1:04:05] Sadiq and there's something in you
[1:04:07] saying that's why we grow I've met the
[1:04:09] king
[1:04:10] I met the king of the New Jerusalem I'm
[1:04:13] not satisfied with being on here I want
[1:04:15] to go to that City
[1:04:16] hallelujah cuz the reason that you're
[1:04:19] groaning is because he came in Mitch and
[1:04:21] he's telling you you have a place in the
[1:04:23] city hallelujah
[1:04:25] hey if I got told I ever mentioned
[1:04:27] somewhere awesome I'd want to go that's
[1:04:32] an earthly thing this is you can't even
[1:04:34] compare people try and express how great
[1:04:37] heaven is the Prophet couldn't express
[1:04:39] that he went there came back changed his
[1:04:41] life the Apostle Paul couldn't speak
[1:04:43] about it for 15 years is translated up
[1:04:45] it came back down it's so glorious
[1:04:48] hallelujah that's why we groan not
[1:04:51] because the world is just the evil it's
[1:04:54] more than that is something and you're
[1:04:55] saying Lord I want to be where you are I
[1:04:58] feel your presence and you move and you
[1:05:01] touch me and you speak to me and it's so
[1:05:03] glorious but you don't want to be where
[1:05:05] you are
[1:05:05] hallelujah I trust that your hearts cry
[1:05:08] I mean there should be a pull
[1:05:10] hallelujah towards the Lord and that's
[1:05:12] why we feel such a feeling that comes
[1:05:14] over us from time to time as you
[1:05:16] recognize Amen there's more to life than
[1:05:19] this hallelujah just beyond the veil
[1:05:22] Amen I want to see your face what
[1:05:25] produces that feeling I asked you that
[1:05:27] question
[1:05:29] what produces that feeling you can be
[1:05:31] walking down the street you can be at
[1:05:33] work you can be in your car you can be
[1:05:35] in your bed you can be at church you can
[1:05:37] be playing kicking the ball around with
[1:05:40] the boys whatever you're doing there's
[1:05:41] something and you're king of war I'm
[1:05:43] with your kids but something just comes
[1:05:44] over you what is it
[1:05:47] what makes that feeling that's God
[1:05:49] that's Jesus Christ brooding over you
[1:05:52] brother Graham says sometimes it feels
[1:05:54] you feel such a sweet humble feeling
[1:05:56] come over you
[1:05:57] he says that's angels that's angels
[1:05:59] coming around you that's not crazy we
[1:06:03] believe in a supernatural world don't we
[1:06:05] amen there you go by feeling no I do not
[1:06:09] but feeling comes with it just like love
[1:06:13] is not a word it's a feeling and it
[1:06:15] changes your life if you love someone
[1:06:17] your whole life has changed because you
[1:06:18] love them Alleluia now I'm glad we grown
[1:06:25] we have a longing it's not because we're
[1:06:28] getting older it's because we want these
[1:06:31] bodies to be changed because we know
[1:06:34] something's got ahold of our souls and
[1:06:36] now we want these bodies to be changed
[1:06:38] don't you want to be where he is amen
[1:06:41] you can take this whole world I want
[1:06:43] Jesus amen you can take this whole world
[1:06:46] I don't care amen waiting for the
[1:06:49] fullness adoption is the redemption the
[1:06:51] change of this body
[1:06:53] Alleluia now we read in Galatians about
[1:06:57] how we're under tutors until the time
[1:07:00] appointed now brother Graham says now as
[1:07:03] I said in the beginning adoption is all
[1:07:06] about
[1:07:06] we're motivated by love you have to have
[1:07:09] confidence the one that's guiding you
[1:07:11] okay he says now now let's change the
[1:07:15] picture now to me this is very profound
[1:07:17] as well now the father his sons a good
[1:07:21] boy he's just dramatizing his sons a
[1:07:23] good boy his father's right along here's
[1:07:27] a tutor the Holy Spirit which way the
[1:07:30] Holy Spirit he says I'm going to walk
[1:07:33] the tutor said I'm going to walk the
[1:07:36] child said I'll walk right with you I'll
[1:07:39] be worth you so is dramatizing two
[1:07:41] people once the tutor
[1:07:43] leading the child the other one's the
[1:07:44] child coming to adoption okay
[1:07:47] and the tutor says oh the hill is awful
[1:07:50] hi son but then the child says I'll go
[1:07:54] right with you I got confidence in you
[1:07:56] if I start getting tired he'll raise my
[1:08:00] hand up and hold me on but there's lines
[1:08:03] up the hill there doesn't matter as long
[1:08:06] as you're around don't make a bit of
[1:08:09] difference I'm walking right along with
[1:08:12] you I mean there's trouble up there

[1:08:44] said you know what father your son is
[1:08:48] just like a chip off the old block
[1:08:49] here's absolutely exactly like you every
[1:08:52] word you say he says amen to it
[1:08:55] I had him turn over in the Bible the
[1:08:57] other that said Jesus Christ the same
[1:08:59] yesterday today and forever you know
[1:09:01] what he said he screamed and throw his
[1:09:03] hands up in the air said hallelujah amen
[1:09:05] and oh and you know it's it in your word
[1:09:13] the works that he the works he that
[1:09:16] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:09:17] shall he do also yeah I remember writing
[1:09:20] that one to my son y'all remember riding
[1:09:22] that old when he saw that he just
[1:09:24] screamed and jumped up and hold
[1:09:26] hallelujah Amen take all the world out
[1:09:28] of me make me like that yes sir
[1:09:30] and all those things that he has done
[1:09:32] and then the father says my sons ready
[1:09:36] hallelujah so he say now the one that
[1:09:40] goes to the adoption he has confidence
[1:09:42] the one leading him oh yeah and you have
[1:09:45] to have the same thing oh we're going to
[1:09:48] go through this trial well as long as I
[1:09:50] know you're holding my hand
[1:09:51] Amen you're gonna go through this dark
[1:09:53] place though I walk through the valley
[1:09:55] of the shadow death
[1:09:57] with me they robbed my staff they
[1:09:59] comfort me all the days of my life
[1:10:01] Alleluia I mean because he leads us
[1:10:03] through but you have to have confidence
[1:10:05] and the one leading you Alleluia
[1:10:08] are you following me amen that is that I
[1:10:12] trust it's in your heart
[1:10:14] amen wherever he leads me I will follow
[1:10:17] hallelujah over high mountains down
[1:10:21] through valleys through the fire through
[1:10:24] the flood wherever it is amen
[1:10:27] he's gonna lead me through I mean
[1:10:29] remember the seat to me this is this is
[1:10:32] this is profoundest because the the Sun
[1:10:35] he doesn't say well I'm young I can do
[1:10:37] it he says as long as you're with me
[1:10:40] I'll be okay because I have confidence
[1:10:42] in you hallelujah amen
[1:10:48] we have some musicians to come do you
[1:10:53] have confidence I'm just good I just
[1:10:54] because I want to have a real kind of
[1:10:56] take home thought do you have confidence
[1:10:58] the one leading you well it's getting
[1:11:01] awful tight I don't know how we're gonna
[1:11:03] make it through but who you looking at
[1:11:05] who you follow it who do you have
[1:11:08] confidence in amen because if you have
[1:11:13] confidence in him now you'll turn out
[1:11:17] all right and he'll say he's exactly
[1:11:21] like you father he believes your word he
[1:11:25] doesn't care what other people say more
[1:11:28] than you all he wants to do is please
[1:11:31] you amen
[1:11:33] you have to have confidence in the
[1:11:35] shepherd now the shepherd is the Holy
[1:11:37] Ghost hallelujah Amen friends we're
[1:11:41] going through we're going through you I
[1:11:44] believe we're going to make it
[1:11:45] I mean God is so real in this end time
[1:11:48] and because he's one to show you what
[1:11:51] you're following is not cunningly
[1:11:52] devised fables of man but the author of
[1:11:56] the word has come to reveal this member
[1:11:58] this is not a textbook we don't have to
[1:12:01] learn it we don't have to study it from
[1:12:04] a human standpoint you know I've said
[1:12:06] before I remember when I was at
[1:12:08] University studied biochem
[1:12:11] Street I should I should maybe put a
[1:12:13] picture up one day there's the Kim the
[1:12:16] the molecular mechanism of how blood
[1:12:18] binds oxygen and how the whole active
[1:12:21] site changes when oxygen is bound then
[1:12:25] how it changes when it's loosed and how
[1:12:28] it changes the it changes the what I
[1:12:32] call the the whole chemical attraction
[1:12:35] of it changes because the structure
[1:12:37] changes when when oxygen is bound it's a
[1:12:39] very complicated thing professor puts it
[1:12:41] up and sees it so well-designed
[1:12:44] this the words it's so well design would
[1:12:47] they say there's a god not in their life
[1:12:50] so they've studied something so so much
[1:12:53] they become blind because they're
[1:12:58] looking at nature because that would say
[1:12:59] to me how's that made I should show you
[1:13:03] a picture it's actually quite
[1:13:04] fascinating you know because there's an
[1:13:07] iron there's an iron molecule and this
[1:13:09] and this nitrogen ring and it moves up
[1:13:13] and down based on when the ions bound
[1:13:14] the whole active Scyther of the blood
[1:13:16] changes the whole thing and to me I'd
[1:13:20] say that's God something made this and
[1:13:23] it cuz it works it doesn't just hold on
[1:13:26] to oxygen just hold on to it lets it go
[1:13:28] and then it gets it again there lets it
[1:13:30] go and transports it and then baby yo
[1:13:34] you know this hemoglobin this myoglobin
[1:13:37] different different your blood is made
[1:13:40] for different things that's amazing so
[1:13:43] well-designed they don't believe there's
[1:13:45] a god because they've studied something
[1:13:47] so much they've become I'd say foolish
[1:13:49] yeah and people have studied this so
[1:13:52] much they miss their very Creator trying
[1:13:53] to speak out of it that's why it to me
[1:13:55] this is not a text book you say Lord
[1:13:58] speak to me out of your word he says
[1:14:01] well be waiting for you to ask that from
[1:14:02] us and see how I will and he does
[1:14:05] hallelujah because that's now the tutor
[1:14:07] trying to get a hold of you saying now
[1:14:09] I'm going to take you by the hand
[1:14:11] now I'm gonna lead you and place you in
[1:14:13] my body hallelujah but if you hold on
[1:14:16] you got a string to your will say Lord
[1:14:19] take my life make it lying there now the
[1:14:22] tutor can use you you know how these
[1:14:23] those kids in class they were
[1:14:24] cut up the ice they never want to do
[1:14:26] what the teacher says they don't get too
[1:14:28] far in exams when it really comes to
[1:14:31] crunch time when these real exams those
[1:14:33] ones that throw stuff and they cut up
[1:14:35] and stuff man just write a big fat F and
[1:14:38] send you on your way why because they're
[1:14:41] not yielded to the tutor because the
[1:14:44] tutor or the teacher has a has something
[1:14:47] in their mind I want to teach this to
[1:14:49] them because it will help them it's just
[1:14:51] natural things
[1:14:51] it's that I'll never use calculus in
[1:14:53] real life some people do you never know
[1:14:58] you know so but it's those those
[1:15:02] students that really say I want to learn
[1:15:04] something I want to learn this they
[1:15:07] really get the full benefit and then
[1:15:09] they can really use what they learn amen
[1:15:13] let's just stand shall we you love the
[1:15:15] Lord tonight hey man we are you say well
[1:15:18] yes just take what you have who's on the
[1:15:23] Lord side Amen just walk with Him have
[1:15:26] confidence in your shepherd the Holy
[1:15:28] Ghost he's got a person he lead you
[1:15:30] eight men and he is not a goat it
[1:15:34] doesn't lead you to the slaughter a man
[1:15:36] I'd like to sing we're more we're able
[1:15:38] to go up and take the country I mean we
[1:15:41] have an inheritance and Jesus Christ
[1:15:44] let's not Plateau there's not get
[1:15:46] comfortable what would it be like if
[1:15:48] you're there with with Israel you
[1:15:49] crossed Jordan supernaturally you put
[1:15:53] about two steps on the bank and maybe
[1:15:55] here's the bank of the Jordan and you
[1:15:57] stop put your tent out here put your
[1:16:01] fishing pole in the river you know and
[1:16:04] someone come along and look at you say
[1:16:06] you're in the tribe of Dan yeah I'm and
[1:16:09] Dan you're not meant to be here what do
[1:16:12] you mean I'm in the land no no you mean
[1:16:14] to be over there no but I'm in the land
[1:16:17] but you want to stay here I'm happy here
[1:16:21] but there's victories to him you know
[1:16:23] what if what if Caleb just crossed over
[1:16:25] it said I'm gonna make me a houseboat
[1:16:27] and I'm gonna be right here I know
[1:16:30] forgive me if I sound ridiculous but
[1:16:32] what if he just said that he would never
[1:16:34] have got his resurrection Mountain
[1:16:36] I mean so don't just satisfy with I'm
[1:16:39] happy being saved
[1:16:40] pressin isn't the title deed is being
[1:16:45] given all that Adam lost has been
[1:16:49] restored to the church why should we
[1:16:51] just sit back and say that's nice
[1:16:53] now hey if there's an inheritance being
[1:16:56] left up for me where is it
[1:16:58] what is it where is it and why don't I
[1:17:00] have it amen that's how it should be
[1:17:04] we're more than able brother in our own
[1:17:07] program says he says there's untapped
[1:17:10] resources in Jesus Christ
[1:17:12] there's untapped resources it's like a
[1:17:15] mountain full of gold and no one's
[1:17:17] minded amen and then there's many places
[1:17:21] in the world where the place has been
[1:17:23] mined out and they start mining through
[1:17:25] the dumps of the rock they discarded and
[1:17:28] they find these valuable stuff in there
[1:17:29] I mean I've been to a place just north
[1:17:32] of Vancouver Squamish there's called is
[1:17:34] this mine now a mining copper and stuff
[1:17:37] and they just dumped all of this mud and
[1:17:40] slurry just out into the bay everywhere
[1:17:41] and they begin to a years later they
[1:17:43] look at this stuff and there's gold
[1:17:45] silver there's more valuable stuff and
[1:17:47] that than there was what they're getting
[1:17:48] in the in the first place it's the same
[1:17:51] thing you say well I've mined all this
[1:17:54] go back and look I've heard every tape
[1:17:58] go back and look there'll be a lot in
