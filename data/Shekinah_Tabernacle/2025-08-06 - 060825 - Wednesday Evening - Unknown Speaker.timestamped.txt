[18:22] Amen. Let's just um pray this evening.
[18:28] Lord, we thank you that we've
[18:29] experienced that
[18:31] amazing love of God, Lord, when we've
[18:33] experienced that it's so rich, so pure.
[18:36] Lord, its motives are so pure. There's
[18:39] no no hidden agenda to do us harm Lord.
[18:42] But your love towards us, Lord, is only
[18:44] for our good, for our benefit, Lord, to
[18:47] to build us up, Lord, to to enrich our
[18:50] lives, Lord. And as we surrender to you
[18:52] more and more each day, we we Lord, we
[18:56] we experience more and more of your love
[18:58] towards us and your goodness, Lord. And
[19:00] we're confident no matter what situation
[19:01] we find ourselves in. We begin to be
[19:04] confident of your love towards us, Lord.
[19:07] Lord, although things might seem
[19:08] contrary in our minds when we look at
[19:09] things, we we know that Lord, everything
[19:11] you do, every step we take, Lord, is for
[19:14] our benefit, Lord, when you're with us,
[19:16] Lord Jesus. So, I just want to pray a
[19:18] blessing upon each one. Thank you for
[19:20] your grace to us, Lord. Thank you for
[19:22] calling each one here this evening,
[19:25] Lord, that none of us are here just as
[19:27] an accident or with no purpose, Lord,
[19:30] but we all have a purpose for being here
[19:31] this evening. We all have a purpose for
[19:34] being on this earth. And we just thank
[19:35] you Lord for touching each heart and
[19:37] soul. And we just pray you bless those
[19:38] that are streaming tonight also. We just
[19:40] commit the service into your hands in
[19:41] Jesus wonderful name. Amen.
[19:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[19:46] all. How you doing? You doing good?
[19:49] That's good. You can actually take your
[19:51] seats. My opening scripture isn't um for
[19:54] a little bit. Thanks musicians.
[20:02] So
[20:05] this is how the sermon came in into
[20:08] being tonight.
[20:10] Two weeks ago it was a Wednesday night
[20:14] and I actually on that particular
[20:16] Wednesday I couldn't make it along. I
[20:18] had to there was things I just had to
[20:21] um
[20:24] do unfortunately which I try not to do
[20:27] that but
[20:30] and um I was busy doing something at
[20:33] 7:30 when the 7:29
[20:36] when the service here starts and my
[20:40] phone was a little bit from me and I
[20:42] noticed it rg
[20:44] and it was brother Ben
[20:47] ringing me at um 7:29. I'm thinking
[20:50] that's unusual. Why would I be getting a
[20:52] phone call at 7:29 from Brother Ben at
[20:55] church here? And and then at this this
[21:00] sort of very
[21:02] awful reality
[21:04] sunk down upon me and I thought, "Oh
[21:06] man, I've done messed up this time."
[21:10] So I I was up in Levvin and that phone
[21:13] call was brother Ben Ring me saying um
[21:15] you realize you're preaching tonight and
[21:17] are you on your way here? Oh man,
[21:22] there's no excuse for it. I said, man,
[21:23] are you I said, look, I I done messed up
[21:25] this time and then slot me put me
[21:27] straight back in the next one. I don't
[21:28] want to let the team down. Um you know,
[21:32] we can say we're busy and this and that,
[21:33] but now we just need a proper calendar
[21:34] and put it in. And anyway, so I thought
[21:38] about that. I, you know, I forgot. I I
[21:41] just I knew it was there, but it just I
[21:44] it was just it's never happened before,
[21:45] but I forgot,
[21:48] which was not good.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Do you forgive me?
[21:59] So So,
[22:02] so that got me thinking about this
[22:04] thought. But I thought, you know,
[22:05] there's this concept that we forget and
[22:06] there's this concept that we remember.
[22:09] You know, as people, we we we
[22:12] remember some things. Sometimes we
[22:13] remember things we ought to forget and
[22:16] sometimes we forget things that we ought
[22:17] to remember.
[22:20] And there's a lot in the word of God
[22:22] about forgetting about and about
[22:23] remembering.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to speak about. Um
[22:27] my thought tonight is remembering and
[22:29] forgetting.
[22:31] We just stand and I just want to read
[22:32] the first scripture. So, if we could
[22:33] turn to um um first Coronicles,
[22:38] I believe it is 16:12. We'll just read
[22:41] this one just as we stand this evening.
[22:48] And this verse says, "Remember
[22:51] his marvelous works that he hath done,
[22:53] his wonders, and the judgments of his
[22:56] mouth." May the Lord bless his word. You
[22:58] can be seated. There's a lot of things
[23:00] in the word of God about remembering and
[23:02] there's a lot of um exhortations or
[23:05] encouragements to us to remember. And
[23:08] this scripture here says remember the
[23:10] marvelous works that he has done his
[23:11] wonders and the judgments of his of his
[23:14] mouth. And David would also say he said
[23:17] bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not
[23:21] all his benefits. He's speaking to his
[23:23] soul. He's saying soul don't forget all
[23:25] that the Lord's done for you. reminding
[23:27] his soul, don't forget what the Lord's
[23:29] done.
[23:31] There's an exhortation to youth. It says
[23:34] when you're young, there's a lot of
[23:35] opportunity out there and things you can
[23:36] go and do and entertain your mind with.
[23:38] But the the scriptures encourage us to
[23:40] say, "Remember now thy creator." Don't
[23:43] let the memory of your creator slip from
[23:45] your mind and you go you start to go
[23:47] through life and through these exciting
[23:49] things without without remembering the
[23:50] God without remembering the great
[23:52] creator and just going your own way and
[23:54] forgetting that there's a God that he's
[23:55] watching that he's looking over all that
[23:57] you do. Remember now thy creator
[23:59] &gt;&gt; in the days of thy youth. There's
[24:01] another scripture that that we're taught
[24:03] that when we hear the word of God, we're
[24:04] taught to remember it. Don't just hear
[24:07] it and then it just means nothing to you
[24:08] and it just drifts away. James says,
[24:10] "But be ye doers of the word and not
[24:12] hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
[24:14] For if any be a hearer of the word and
[24:16] not a doer, he is like a man beholding
[24:19] his natural face in a glass." If you
[24:21] ever tried this, you know it's true. You
[24:22] look in the mirror to see what you look
[24:24] like. You turn away. You can't remember
[24:26] what you look like. You forgot. He says,
[24:29] "For he beholdeth himself. He looks at
[24:31] himself. Then he goes his way and
[24:33] straightway forgets what manner of man
[24:34] he was." It's like he's saying, "Don't
[24:37] be like that with the word of God, where
[24:38] the word of God comes and then you
[24:39] straight away you just forget it." We're
[24:41] not supposed to do that with the word of
[24:43] God. We're supposed to remember it and
[24:44] do it. Don't forget it. He says, "But
[24:47] who so lookth into the perfect law of
[24:48] liberty and contin
[24:51] forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
[24:54] work, this man shall be blessed in his
[24:56] deed."
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and God's got this awesome
[25:00] memory that God can remember things and
[25:02] he can forget things. Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; He's got a way of doing that. And God
[25:06] remembers the things he's supposed to
[25:07] remember. And he forgets the things he's
[25:09] supposed to forget. And there's no
[25:10] blurring the lines between the two.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; And he he says of us, he says, "This is
[25:15] the covenant that I'll make with them
[25:16] after those days, sayeth the Lord. I'll
[25:18] put my laws into their hearts, and in
[25:20] their minds will I write them, and their
[25:23] sins and their iniquities will I
[25:24] remember no more."
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. you and me when we when we repent,
[25:27] when we commit our lives to the Lord,
[25:28] when we receive the Holy Ghost, he says,
[25:30] "I'll write my law in your hearts. I'll
[25:31] cause you to remember it and all of your
[25:33] sins, all your iniquities, I'll forget
[25:34] them all."
[25:36] &gt;&gt; We serve a God that forgets it all. We
[25:38] We confess our sins to the Lord and he
[25:40] forgets every single one of them.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; He doesn't remember it. He can't recall
[25:43] what it was. He forgets it all.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just It doesn't suddenly
[25:47] creep back into his memory. It's gone
[25:48] forever. He forgets it. Your sins, your
[25:50] iniquities will I remember no more.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] He doesn't forget his promises to us
[25:57] too. One day he was there and he went
[25:59] down and and the children of Israel were
[26:01] in bondage for 400 years and they were
[26:02] they were afflicted. They were crying
[26:04] out to God. And one day God visited
[26:05] Moses and he said, "I've heard the
[26:07] groanings of the children of Israel whom
[26:10] the Egyptians keep in bondage and I'll
[26:12] remember my covenant."
[26:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't just drift away and forget
[26:16] that I had made a covenant with Abraham,
[26:17] with Isaac, with Jacob. He remembered
[26:19] his covenant with them. you can be sure
[26:21] he was going to live be true to the
[26:23] covenant that he made with them because
[26:25] he wasn't going to forget it. Sometimes
[26:26] we think, "Oh, is that person going to
[26:28] remember that I'm here waiting for
[26:29] them?" You know, are they are they going
[26:30] to meet me here? Do they remember? God
[26:32] never forgets. If he's supposed to meet
[26:33] you somewhere or meet his word, if he's
[26:35] at meet you at a place where his word
[26:37] is, he'll be there. He never forgets.
[26:40] And yet, yet we in our minds, we can
[26:42] sometimes uh remember things that we
[26:44] ought to forget.
[26:46] The children of Israel left Egypt. They
[26:48] should have just left Egypt. They should
[26:50] have left all the things that were there
[26:51] and they should have moved on to the
[26:52] promised land and just forgotten all
[26:53] those things that were in the past and
[26:55] move forward to the promises of God to
[26:56] the new the new land that he had. But
[26:59] the but the word of God says that there
[27:00] was a mixed multitude of different ones
[27:02] that some were trying to forget, others
[27:04] were trying hard to remember what was
[27:07] back there. So they were mixing
[27:08] together. And it says and then they it
[27:10] says they fell a lusting or they started
[27:12] thinking about this and desiring it. And
[27:13] it says and then the children of Israel
[27:16] wept because they were starting to get
[27:18] hungry. They were starting to get sick
[27:19] of the manner all the time. And they
[27:20] said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
[27:24] &gt;&gt; And then they said, "For we remember,
[27:28] &gt;&gt; we remember the fish that we used to
[27:29] eat." I can still taste it in my mouth.
[27:32] The fish back in Egypt. We remember the
[27:35] cucumbers.
[27:37] Who craves after cucumbers?
[27:42] And the melons. Melons. I can
[27:43] understand. The leaks, the onions, the
[27:46] garlic. They remembered all these
[27:47] things. cuz they remembered well it was
[27:49] that was quite good. They were starting
[27:50] to relive all these memories and it
[27:51] displeased God cuz they should have been
[27:53] not even thinking about that just
[27:55] looking forward to his promises.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; And then they said there was nothing at
[27:59] all besides this manner which was
[28:00] angel's food.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; They despised that and they started
[28:04] casting their mind back and remembering
[28:05] things that they ought to forget.
[28:08] And other times when God had wrought a
[28:10] mighty deliverance in their land, he he
[28:12] had raised up a man called Gideon and he
[28:14] he had worked powerfully through Gideon
[28:16] and he had defeated all of their enemies
[28:18] and he he gave them peace in the land. I
[28:20] think it was for about 70 years or 80
[28:22] years they had peace and God blessed
[28:24] them once Gideon came through and
[28:25] defeated all their enemies. But then as
[28:27] time went on and they began to they
[28:29] forgot what God had done for them. It
[28:32] just become common that they were
[28:33] blessed in the land and that it was
[28:45] it became common that they were blessed
[28:47] in the land and and that things were
[28:49] just going their way. And it says, "And
[28:50] the children of Israel remembered not
[28:52] the Lord their God who had delivered
[28:54] them out of the hands of all their
[28:55] enemies on every side." They they began
[28:58] to forget that the great thing that God
[29:00] had done. They just began to forget it
[29:01] and they that they let it fade from
[29:03] their memory when they ought to have
[29:05] remembered it.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; They they were busy remembering the
[29:08] leaks, remembering the cucumbers and
[29:09] busy forgetting the powerful works of
[29:11] God.
[29:13] They they deemed a cucumber more
[29:15] important than the mighty deliverance of
[29:17] God.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; God when people become like that, he he
[29:21] speaks in Psalm 50 about those that
[29:24] follow the Lord. And he talks about the
[29:25] wicked that forgot God and how they
[29:27] would just cast God from their their
[29:29] thinking and they just do all sort all
[29:30] the things that they want to do. And God
[29:32] says he he he
[29:35] doesn't have a lot of time for that sort
[29:36] of behavior because he says now consider
[29:38] this ye that forgot God lest I tear you
[29:40] in pieces and there be none to deliver.
[29:42] He's not interested in people that ought
[29:44] to be remembering him that just start to
[29:46] forget him and walk another way. He
[29:48] doesn't like that approach
[29:49] &gt;&gt; to himself. He wants us to remember. And
[29:52] there are many men in the Bible and
[29:54] women in the Bible that went through
[29:55] very hard times. Yet, they still
[29:57] remembered God. They still they still
[29:59] cried out to God. They didn't just
[30:00] forget. One of them was Job. And in all
[30:04] of Job's trials, he still remembered
[30:06] God. He didn't just forget God like his
[30:08] wife said, "Oh, just curse God and die.
[30:10] Forget about God and move on." But Job
[30:13] would cry to God. He said, "Oh, that
[30:14] thou wouldest hide me in the grave. That
[30:17] thou wouldest keep me a secret, keep me
[30:18] secret until thy wrath be passed. hide
[30:20] me away somewhere. He said, "But at an
[30:23] appointed time, remember me."
[30:26] &gt;&gt; At an appointed time, come and find me
[30:28] again. Don't just leave me there, but
[30:29] remember me.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible called
[30:32] Hannah. And Hannah had always wanted a
[30:34] child, but she was barren. She can never
[30:36] have a child. And one day, she she came
[30:38] to the was in the temple and she was
[30:40] crying out to God. And I believe it was
[30:42] Eli, the priest in the temple. They
[30:44] thought she was drunk because she was so
[30:46] desperately crying out to God. And she
[30:48] was saying, "Oh God, hear me, Lord." She
[30:50] She was saying, "Lord, look on the
[30:52] affliction of thy handmade and remember
[30:54] me. Forget not thine handmade. Lord,
[30:57] don't forget me." If we cry out to God
[30:59] and say, "God, don't forget me." He
[31:01] won't forget us. Lord, remember me.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; And he thought she was drunk, but she
[31:05] was just in desperation crying out to
[31:07] God. Lord, remember me. Give me a child,
[31:09] Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; And if you do, Lord, I'll commit him
[31:11] over to you. Two things. She made a
[31:14] promise to God. And God knew that she
[31:15] would remember her promise. Yeah,
[31:17] &gt;&gt; she wouldn't. She said, "Lord, remember
[31:19] me and I'll remember my promise that I
[31:21] make to you."
[31:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that she went home and
[31:24] she they she knew
[31:27] she she knew her husband. They did that.
[31:29] And it says and then it says, "And the
[31:31] Lord remembered her
[31:33] &gt;&gt; when that happened. The Lord remembered
[31:35] her. Remembered that she'd cried out and
[31:37] and we know the story that she had a had
[31:40] a child. There was another man which was
[31:42] the thief on the cross when he was there
[31:43] and he was he was on his last breath and
[31:46] he'd seen the whole situation unfold and
[31:48] he'd seen this innocent man being put to
[31:50] death and there was something in him
[31:51] that that he knew that this person was
[31:53] more than just a mere mortal man that
[31:55] this man was the son of God. That's why
[31:56] he said Lord remember me when you go
[31:58] into paradise
[32:00] remember me. The Lord said this day you
[32:03] should be in paradise with me. Samson
[32:05] was the same when Samson would looked
[32:07] like he lived a failure of a life. The
[32:08] Lord had blessed him in time past, but
[32:10] over as the years went on, he forgot
[32:12] God. And he began to go after other
[32:13] things, and he ended up grinding in the
[32:16] middle with his eyes plucked out. And it
[32:17] seemed like there was no hope for him.
[32:19] And he was like all his hopes were gone.
[32:21] And his life was going to amount to
[32:22] nothing. And he was just going to become
[32:24] a a a skeleton, a few a bag of bones in
[32:27] some grinding mill, and amount to
[32:29] nothing. But he said, "Lord, once more,
[32:32] just remember me. Lord, remember me."
[32:35] But the promise to him that God had made
[32:37] was that he'll be a Nazarite from the
[32:38] day of his birth till the day of his
[32:40] death.
[32:41] That means he was a son of God. He had
[32:43] the power of God upon him from when he
[32:44] was born to when he died. Didn't matter
[32:46] how bleak his life looked. That's why he
[32:48] could cry out, "Lord, remember me." And
[32:49] and right in the last moments of his
[32:51] life, the Lord remembered him.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord has this way. He the Lord
[32:56] has knows how we think and that we
[32:58] forget things easily. So the Lord
[33:00] actually puts things in place and wants
[33:02] us to do things out of repetition to
[33:04] make us remember
[33:07] before he delivered the children of
[33:08] Israel when he was going to when he was
[33:11] going to slay all the firstborn in
[33:12] Egypt.
[33:14] He he said they had to get some hissop
[33:16] and they had to get some blood. They had
[33:16] to paint it around the door. Then they
[33:18] had to kill a a lamb and eat it with
[33:20] bitter herbs.
[33:22] But he said you're not just going to do
[33:24] it tonight. I want you to do this every
[33:26] year. We're going to call this month the
[33:27] first of the month for you. And every
[33:28] single year you are going to do this
[33:30] year after year after year purely for
[33:33] the fact that so you remember what I've
[33:34] done.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; So this doesn't just this massive event
[33:37] doesn't just happen then it just drifts
[33:38] off into the past and there's no memory
[33:40] of it. But I want you to every year in
[33:42] this same day make a feast eat and
[33:44] remember what I've done and then down
[33:46] the line it says
[33:48] down the way you way way way down it
[33:50] could be a generation could be 10
[33:52] generations it could be now children ask
[33:54] why are we doing this feast? Why are we
[33:56] eating this? And the what's this for?
[34:00] And he says, well, this is so we
[34:01] remember that way back then, God
[34:04] delivered us from the from bondage.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And you know how you know it's true.
[34:10] Do you know that? Do you do you want to
[34:11] know how that that happened to the
[34:13] Egyptians that the Lord sail the
[34:14] firstborn?
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Because they still remember it now.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; This originated from a certain point
[34:21] which was the night that it happened.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; It didn't get made up later on. And it
[34:26] happened. That's why 2,000 3,000 years
[34:29] later, the Passover feast still happens
[34:32] in this world. People still remember it
[34:34] &gt;&gt; because it happened.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; And and children still ask, "Why do we
[34:39] do this?" And they still say, "Because
[34:40] we remember."
[34:43] God and and the Lord when he was here
[34:46] before the day the night before he was
[34:48] going to be crucified it said he took he
[34:50] took the wine and he took some bread and
[34:51] he broke it and he said I want you to do
[34:54] this always in remembrance of me
[34:56] &gt;&gt; this do in remembrance of me remember
[34:58] don't just forget that I've paid for
[35:00] your sins but he he he often does
[35:02] something to trigger our memory that's
[35:04] why he says take it take some unleaven
[35:06] bread take some wine and when you look
[35:08] at it it will trigger your mind to
[35:09] remember I I'm not eating this bread
[35:12] because it's something special in the
[35:13] bread, but I'm eating this because I
[35:15] remember that the Lord's body was broken
[35:17] like I'm going to break this bread. We
[35:18] He He said, "Do this so you remember."
[35:22] Every time you drink the wine, you're
[35:23] not drinking the blood of the Lord. But
[35:24] you're remembering this wine looks like
[35:26] blood. There was some blood that was
[35:28] shed for me. Now, when I drink it, I
[35:30] remember that there was blood shed for
[35:31] me. I remember that I'm paid with a that
[35:33] I've been bought with a price. I
[35:34] remember this wasn't cheap. I remember
[35:36] someone had to make an effort for me.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; I remember a body had to be broken for
[35:40] me. We remember
[35:42] Peter says a lot of times after he's
[35:45] after he finished talking about the
[35:46] stature of a perfect man, Peter was was
[35:50] so intent on making sure we remember.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He said it four times. I want to make
[35:56] sure you remember that that that this is
[36:00] that that as a Christian, you're
[36:01] supposed to be being built up in the
[36:03] faith and you're supposed to be enriched
[36:05] every day and you should be adding to
[36:07] your faith virtue and to virtue
[36:08] knowledge to knowledge, temperance to
[36:10] temperance, patience to patience,
[36:11] godliness, to godliness, brotherly
[36:13] kindness. You should always be doing
[36:14] that. I want you to remember, don't just
[36:16] forget that and focus on something else.
[36:18] You should always be being built up in
[36:19] your spiritual self to the stature of a
[36:21] perfect man. He said, "Wherefore I will
[36:23] not be negligent to put you always in
[36:25] remembrance of these things, though you
[36:28] know them and be established in the
[36:29] present truth." And he said again, "Yay,
[36:31] I think it meat or I think it's a good
[36:33] thing as long as I'm in this tabernacle
[36:35] to stir you up by putting you in my
[36:37] remembrance."
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Always reminding you, reminding you, are
[36:40] you building up the into the stature of
[36:42] a perfect man or a perfect woman? Are
[36:44] you making effort into that or are you
[36:45] just letting it drift aside? Are you
[36:47] remembering it all the time? Lord, build
[36:48] me up to the stature of a perfect man. I
[36:50] don't want to forget that, Lord. I want
[36:51] to make that my focus. And he said
[36:53] again, knowing that shortly I must put
[36:55] off this my tabernacle. In other words,
[36:56] I'm going to die. I'm not going to exist
[36:57] anymore. Even as our Lord Jesus Christ
[37:00] has showed me, then he says, "Moreover,
[37:01] I will endeavor that ye may be able
[37:03] after my deceased to have these things
[37:05] always in remembrance, even after I've
[37:08] gone. Don't forget this stuff. Read it.
[37:10] Tell your children. Tell the fellowship.
[37:12] Tell everyone about it. Build yourself
[37:13] up into the statue of a perfect man."
[37:16] We had a very drastic one of probably
[37:19] the most traumatic events that happened
[37:20] to this country was was World War I
[37:24] where it wasn't here, but a lot of our
[37:27] young men, the the you'd say the best
[37:30] and the the brightest, the fittest young
[37:32] men went overseas to fight in in in a in
[37:35] a in these wars that are a complete
[37:37] waste of time just because a couple of
[37:40] people can't sort of resolve their
[37:43] differences. millions of young men and
[37:46] women now have to go and die for some
[37:48] pathetic squabble that a few people
[37:50] have. There's nothing good about a war.
[37:53] People that glamorize them. There's
[37:54] nothing good about wars whatsoever. We
[37:57] know that in this world where there's
[37:58] hatred, there's going to be wars. But we
[38:01] I don't I I personally think you you
[38:03] imagine this like like you've got a
[38:05] you've got a some a family's raised up a
[38:07] a couple of boys and they spent their
[38:09] them think of all the effort that the
[38:11] mother and father have put into these
[38:12] boys from a baby to raise them up and to
[38:14] to instill values into them to teach
[38:16] them about to teach them skills. all
[38:19] these things in years, years, 15, 20
[38:21] years and then these boys get taken off
[38:23] to some foreign shore and then some
[38:26] bullet that another person just kills
[38:28] that person that doesn't even know who
[38:29] they are or why they're there or
[38:30] nothing. They just shoot them and that's
[38:32] that that whole life gone. It's such a
[38:34] futile, silly waste of time. But this
[38:38] war here in New Zealand, there was one
[38:40] there was a about a million people in
[38:42] New Zealand at the time of 1.1 million
[38:43] and about 120,000 went off to war. So
[38:47] that's that's one in every 10 people
[38:49] went to off to this war. That's a
[38:51] massive part of the population. That's
[38:53] that's huge. And two out of every 100
[38:57] people in this country died from that
[38:58] war. You might not think that's very
[39:00] many, but you know 100 people easily in
[39:02] your circles. You easily know 50 people.
[39:04] That would be you. That would be two
[39:06] people that you know dying.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And some people know more than 100
[39:10] people. That would be two people. And
[39:11] you imagine everybody that you knew in
[39:14] the whole country knew someone that
[39:15] died. Whether it be close to you or a
[39:17] friend or someone, you all knew someone
[39:18] that died. So the whole country, it was
[39:20] like this time of mourning. This whole
[39:22] the the whole country had had suffered
[39:24] mourning because two two out of 100
[39:27] people had suddenly died.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; You can imagine it was such a traumatic
[39:30] time for this country. That's why you go
[39:33] around there's so many memorials all
[39:34] throughout. You go to some rural little
[39:36] town in the middle of nowhere, there's a
[39:37] memorial,
[39:39] there's a there's a hall and there's a
[39:40] memorial because from that little
[39:42] community, someone died. It was such a
[39:44] traumatic thing. And these these the
[39:46] people didn't want to forget.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; They that the whole saying is less we
[39:50] forget. Less we forget that this is what
[39:52] happened to us. We these boys went off
[39:54] and they half of them didn't come back.
[39:57] Less we forget. There's a and they
[39:59] that's why Anzac Day they read this this
[40:01] little poem. It says they shall not grow
[40:02] old as we that are left grow old. Age
[40:04] shall not weary them nor the years
[40:06] condemn. At the going down of the sun
[40:08] and in the morning we will remember
[40:09] them. We won't just forget that that
[40:11] this massive portion of our population
[40:13] just went and died on foreign soil. But
[40:14] we will remember them.
[40:18] But not so for the righteous. The of the
[40:21] righteous it says he shall never be
[40:22] shaken. The righteous will be remembered
[40:25] forever.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; That's the part I want to get into here.
[40:28] That the righteous will be remembered
[40:30] forever. But not the wicked. The wicked
[40:33] are going to be forgotten.
[40:36] And every man and every woman that
[40:38] thinks that they can they can go on with
[40:40] their life without making Jesus the king
[40:41] of their life, eventually they're going
[40:42] to be forgotten.
[40:44] They're not going to be remembered
[40:45] forever. There'll be a there'll be a
[40:47] time where every even the memory of them
[40:48] is forgotten. They don't exist anymore.
[40:51] They're forgotten.
[40:53] The wicked will be forgotten. There's a
[40:54] scripture in Psalm and it says, "Wilt
[40:56] thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the
[40:59] dead arise and praise thee? Shall thy
[41:01] love and kindness be declared in the
[41:03] grave? All thy faithfulness and
[41:05] destruction? Shall thy wonders be known
[41:07] in the dark and thy righteousness in the
[41:09] land of forgetfulness?"
[41:11] There's a land of forgetfulness where
[41:13] it's just forgotten.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; There's a land of forgetfulness where
[41:17] everyone that turns up there is
[41:18] forgotten. It's the land of
[41:20] forgetfulness and all and that the
[41:22] wicked go to the land of forgetfulness.
[41:24] We we call it hell. We call it whatever.
[41:25] But it has an end because it all gets
[41:27] forgotten.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; It's the land of forgetfulness. There is
[41:30] the there's no righteous man that's
[41:32] going to have a memory in the land of
[41:33] forgetfulness.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And that's why even all of our sins
[41:36] that's that's why they all originate
[41:39] when your sins are forgiven. and they go
[41:40] on to the one and dragged down to the
[41:42] land of forgetfulness and gone forever.
[41:44] And that's where the Lord, when you get
[41:45] forgiven of your sins, it goes back to
[41:48] whoever originated it because it was
[41:50] caused, you were caused to sin by
[41:52] somebody, somebody tempted you to sin.
[41:56] You realize that?
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And when the Lord, the Lord cast it in
[42:00] the sea of his forgetfulness, he casts
[42:02] it back here.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a and it goes back
[42:04] to the land of forgetfulness and it's
[42:06] going to be gone, punished, and gone
[42:07] forever one day. But there is a land of
[42:10] and forgetfulness.
[42:12] You've all seen these pictures of old
[42:14] cities where these were once glorious
[42:15] cities that that now they they dig a bit
[42:18] under the ground. They say, "Well, there
[42:19] was a city here at one point. The city
[42:21] was forgotten.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; It was no more. This the city at one
[42:25] point was maybe a glorious city with
[42:27] commerce bustling, people coming and
[42:29] going, festivals in it, all sorts of
[42:31] things. But at some point something
[42:32] happened and the city began to decay and
[42:35] fall and another country, another
[42:37] kingdom took it over and the city
[42:38] becomes forgotten and they they find
[42:40] ruins of an old city that's been
[42:41] forgotten.
[42:43] And all of these cities in the world, we
[42:44] think of these great cities in the
[42:46] world. If these cities don't surrender
[42:48] to the name of the Lord Jesus, which
[42:49] they haven't, these cities one day are
[42:50] all going to be forgotten.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; You might go there now and think, well,
[42:53] this is such a glorious city. They're
[42:55] all going to be forgotten.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; They're all going to be forgotten. Every
[42:59] single one of them are going to be
[43:00] forgotten.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; They're going to be worse than this one.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; No matter how glamorous they look, how
[43:06] how great they are, how big they how big
[43:08] they build the buildings, nice glass
[43:10] faces and all that. They're all going to
[43:11] be forgotten. Every city in the world is
[43:13] going to be forgotten. But there's one
[43:15] city that's never going to be forgotten.
[43:16] That's the new Jerusalem. That city's
[43:19] never going to be forgotten. It's never
[43:20] going to be never going to be under
[43:22] ashes anywhere. And John said wrote
[43:24] about it. He said, "I saw the holy city,
[43:25] the new Jerusalem, coming down from God
[43:27] out of heaven, prepared as a bride for
[43:30] her husband, the new Jerusalem. This
[43:32] city is a city we're after. It's a city
[43:33] that's never going to be forgotten.
[43:35] These are the cities. I don't care too
[43:37] much for these, but I'm into this. New
[43:39] Jerusalem, the city that's never going
[43:41] to be forgotten." And and as a type in
[43:43] the natural, that's our spiritual
[43:45] Jerusalem. But there is a natural
[43:47] Jerusalem. And and the the what what
[43:49] that is to the believer is what
[43:51] Jerusalem is to the Jews. And that's why
[43:53] David said, "Oh, if I forget Jerusalem,
[43:55] let my right hand forget her cunning."
[43:58] Think of how good David was with his
[44:00] right hand, too, with a sling and with a
[44:02] spear. Think of how good. And he said,
[44:04] "Lord, if I forget Jerusalem, if I
[44:07] forget that holy city, let my right hand
[44:08] forget how to throw a stone, how to
[44:10] sling a sling. Let my right hand forget
[44:13] her cunning." He's saying, "Let
[44:15] everything else, oh, let me forget
[44:17] everything else. Don't let me forget
[44:18] Jerusalem." And that should be like with
[44:20] a believer. Lord, I don't mind
[44:21] forgetting everything else, but don't
[44:23] let me forget you. Don't let me forget
[44:25] your kingdom. Don't let me forget your
[44:26] love and kindness. Lord, don't let me
[44:28] forget your goodness. I don't mind all
[44:30] this other stuff, but don't let me
[44:31] forget that. Just like David said, Lord,
[44:33] don't let me forget Jerusalem.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; That's why when that when the children
[44:37] of Israel ended up when when they sinned
[44:40] and they forgot about God and they were
[44:41] dragged over to to Babylon, they sat
[44:43] there and they said and and and David
[44:46] describes it. He says, "By the rivers of
[44:48] Babylon, there we sat down and there we
[44:50] wept. When we remembered Zion,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; when we remembered that city, we'd
[44:54] forgotten about the city. We remembered
[44:55] it again. There many times the
[44:56] backslider. They get to this place.
[44:58] They're they're in the good things of
[45:00] God. They're serving God, but they
[45:01] forget God and they go away. And when it
[45:04] all comes crashing down, they end up in
[45:05] Babylon by some foreign river somewhere
[45:08] that means nothing to them. And they
[45:09] think about the good things of God. And
[45:11] they weep when they remember Zion. when
[45:12] they remembered, I I I just want to be
[45:15] back there like the prodigal son when he
[45:16] was in a pig when he remembered far
[45:19] better back in my father's house.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, all their captives
[45:26] said, "Oh, sing us some of those happy
[45:27] songs of Zion. Pick you up your guitar
[45:30] and give me a nice old strum and sing
[45:32] some of those happy songs of Zion." They
[45:33] said, "How can we sing these songs in a
[45:34] strange land?" And then David goes on to
[45:37] say, "If I forget thee, oh Jerusalem,
[45:38] let my right hand forget her cunning. If
[45:41] I do not remember thee, let my tongue
[45:42] cleave to the roof of my mouth. If I do
[45:44] not remember, prefer Jerusalem above my
[45:47] chief joy. And that's why I say, Lord,
[45:50] let me forget everything. Whatever there
[45:52] is here to forget, let me forget, Lord,
[45:54] but don't let me forget you. In my in my
[45:57] time here in my mind, Lord, I don't mind
[45:58] if I I learn a math equation, I forget
[46:01] the answer. Who cares?
[46:03] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to forget you, Lord. I
[46:04] don't want to forget your word. If I I
[46:06] learn a bit about the sound and I forget
[46:08] it, who cares? I'll relearn it. I learn
[46:10] a recipe, I forget it. Who cares, Lord?
[46:12] But don't let me forget you,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Lord. And that's what Paul says. Yay.
[46:15] Doubtless I count all things but loss
[46:17] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[46:19] Christ Jesus. Lord, I'll forget
[46:22] everything, but don't let me forget you,
[46:23] Lord.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; For whom I've suffered the loss of all
[46:26] things, and do count them, but dung that
[46:28] I may win Christ.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Paul was prepared to forget everything
[46:32] he ever knew, just so he could remember
[46:34] Christ, remember his word. That's why he
[46:36] ended up in a prison. But he said,
[46:37] "Doesn't matter everything else I can
[46:39] forget. Forget my old life. Forget
[46:41] everything, Lord. But don't let me
[46:42] forget you." And sure as anything,
[46:44] that's the one thing we need to
[46:46] remember. Don't matter about anything
[46:47] else really. When you boil it all down,
[46:49] you can forget forget everything else.
[46:51] Don't forget the Lord.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Many people forget the Lord and they
[46:54] walk off certain ways and it doesn't do
[46:56] them any good.
[46:57] And that we can get like that in our own
[46:59] life. We can sometimes let our carnal
[47:01] nature take over and start to plant in
[47:03] us an evil heart of unbelief. We we we
[47:05] we even serving the Lord, we begin to
[47:07] forget him. We begin to forget his
[47:09] goodness. We begin to forget his ways
[47:11] and we can actually be dragged away from
[47:13] our from really having the Lord in full
[47:15] remembrance in our mind. It can drag us
[47:17] away and we start to just push it aside.
[47:19] But we can let that carnal nature come
[47:20] in and and take us aside this way or
[47:23] take us that way. We all know that we've
[47:24] been there. That's why Paul says, "But I
[47:26] keep my body and bring it into
[47:28] subjection less that by any means when I
[47:30] have preached to others, I myself should
[47:32] be a cast away." And once more he says,
[47:34] "Take heed, brethren, lest there be any
[47:36] of you an evil heart of unbelief." When
[47:38] you start to forget about the things of
[47:40] God and then unbelief just starts to
[47:41] settle in a bit and he calls it an evil
[47:44] heart of unbelief because it starts to
[47:45] just cloud over your mind and we start
[47:47] to forget God and other things become
[47:49] more important than than the word of God
[47:51] than the things of God. The things of
[47:52] God no longer satisfy us anymore. They
[47:54] no longer give us joy anymore. they no
[47:56] longer that that little bit of that
[47:58] little bit of warmth in your heart that
[48:00] used to give it doesn't give it anymore
[48:01] because we've let this evil heart of
[48:03] unbelief unbelief come in and this type
[48:07] kind of works and I just want to go
[48:09] through it a bit but you can look at
[48:10] Egypt you know as long as Egypt had
[48:14] Joseph there they were blessed
[48:16] &gt;&gt; even though they were an evil nation as
[48:18] long as they had Joseph there they were
[48:19] blessed and and they were going along
[48:22] and and and life was going well for them
[48:24] because he because They they had Joseph
[48:27] there and they let the children of
[48:28] Israel dwell with them and and you could
[48:30] say that was like the spirit of God was
[48:31] dwelling with them and that and and as
[48:33] long as they were dwelling there with
[48:35] the children of with Joseph, they were
[48:37] right. But the Bible says that later on
[48:41] uh the the Egypt's carnal nature rose up
[48:44] because there arose a pharaoh. There
[48:46] arose a king that knew not Joseph.
[48:48] Stopped caring about Joseph. didn't care
[48:50] that ah that the reason why we're
[48:51] prospering. The reason why we're one of
[48:53] the greatest nations in the world is
[48:54] because we've got Joseph with us. But
[48:56] they begin to not care. And it's the
[48:58] same with a with a man or a woman or
[49:00] it's the same with a even a
[49:01] denomination. They could the law can
[49:03] move and they start to think, "Oh, we
[49:04] don't really need the Lord the spirit of
[49:05] God as much anymore. We can carry on our
[49:07] own way. We've got this now. We got a
[49:09] bigger church. We got everything sorted.
[49:10] We don't really need the spirit of God
[49:11] as much anymore. We can go our own way.
[49:13] We we can sort of forget about the how
[49:15] we used to be all in revival. We don't
[49:17] really need that anymore." Even
[49:18] countries, you know, they start off in a
[49:20] revival, but then they drift away. We
[49:21] think we don't really need God anymore,
[49:23] but they always need God. And God God is
[49:26] he he was diligent to point out to us.
[49:28] He told of the children of Israel, he
[49:30] said, "Watch out for that mindset coming
[49:31] in you." He said, he said, "When you get
[49:33] into the land," he says, "If you start
[49:34] to say in your heart, my power and the
[49:37] might of mine hand have gotten me this
[49:38] wealth." If you start to think that,
[49:40] forget that it's the Lord. He said, "But
[49:42] thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,
[49:44] for it is he that giveth thee power to
[49:46] get wealth, that he may establish his
[49:48] covenant, which he swear unto thy
[49:49] fathers, as it is this day." But over
[49:52] time, Egypt began to despise Joseph.
[49:54] They began to forget what he the Lord
[49:56] had done. They begin to not care, and
[49:57] they just they despised Joseph so much
[50:00] that that one day Joseph departed from
[50:03] them.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Now, they were thinking, "This is the
[50:05] greatest thing out. Joseph departed."
[50:07] But it was the worst thing that ever
[50:08] could have happened to them was Joseph
[50:10] departing.
[50:12] And the Lord says, "My spirit will not
[50:14] always strive with man and that he is
[50:15] flesh." You know, and we don't want to
[50:17] strive with the spirit of God so much
[50:19] that one day it just decides to depart
[50:20] from us because the minute it does,
[50:23] we're in trouble. We our life can be
[50:24] going a certain way, but you you'll
[50:26] you'll know for sure when the spirit of
[50:27] God begins to depart from you because
[50:29] things aren't as good as what they used
[50:30] to be. Life is not as fresh as what it
[50:32] used to be. It goes a certain way. And
[50:34] that's just what happened to the to
[50:35] Egypt when Israel departed.
[50:38] But they thought they could just go on
[50:40] without the spirit of God. Forget about
[50:42] it. Forget Joseph,
[50:44] but
[50:46] where's I haven't got a picture, but
[50:56] but Egypt only prospered for a short
[50:58] short season
[51:01] &gt;&gt; and the whole of the Egyptian army was
[51:03] brought down in a single day. the whole
[51:06] might, the whole everything that Egypt
[51:08] was was brought down in a single day.
[51:10] And it was the same with Noah. They
[51:12] forgot God. They didn't want to retain
[51:13] God in their thinking.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And what happened in a and within two
[51:18] months from a certain point, the
[51:20] civilization was finished.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; But not so for the righteous.
[51:28] In the book of Isaiah, it says that we
[51:30] might become at a time where we we we
[51:32] can get a bit despondent with life, you
[51:33] know, because things can sometimes get a
[51:34] bit hard. It says, "But Zion and and the
[51:38] Lord can I think he understands how we
[51:40] get in our minds sometimes." And it
[51:41] says, "But Zion said, the Lord hath
[51:43] forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten
[51:45] me." You ever get that situation? You
[51:47] think, "Oh, maybe the Lord's forgotten
[51:49] me."
[51:51] Maybe he's forsaken me. You know, we
[51:53] know he hasn't because he says he'll
[51:54] never leave us or forsake us. But we can
[51:56] sort of we don't watch it. We can let
[51:57] this sort of thing come upon us. But the
[52:00] Lord's reply to that to you
[52:03] to you to his children is always the
[52:05] same. Can a woman forget her her
[52:08] suckling child that she should not have
[52:11] compassion on the son of her womb? And
[52:13] he says, "Yay, they may forget, yet I
[52:16] will not forget thee.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget thee."
[52:21] &gt;&gt; You might think the Lord's forgotten me.
[52:22] And the Lord's reply back is, "No, no,
[52:24] you're my child. I'll never forget you.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you. He goes one step
[52:28] further. He says, "Behold, I have
[52:30] engraved you, engraven you on the palms
[52:32] of my hand."
[52:33] &gt;&gt; That's how much I'm not going to forget
[52:34] you. Your your your name is engraved on
[52:37] the palm of my hand. I'm not going to
[52:39] forget you. And he even says, "I've
[52:41] written a book before me about you."
[52:44] And he said, "It's called the book of
[52:46] remembrance. And all the thoughts and
[52:47] all your deeds,
[52:49] everything you've thought and everything
[52:50] you've done, I've written in a book
[52:52] before me. It's called the book of
[52:54] remembrance.
[52:56] Malachi spokes about it. He says, "And
[52:58] they that feared the Lord spake one to
[53:00] another. And the Lord hearkened and
[53:02] heard it, and a book of remembrance was
[53:04] written before him for them that feared
[53:06] the Lord and their thought upon his
[53:08] name." And we're not talking about the
[53:09] book of life. We're talking about the
[53:10] book of remembrance. The Lord loves it
[53:13] so much when he hears you talking about
[53:14] him and when he sees the things you do,
[53:16] when he sees it not going well, but you
[53:17] still praise the Lord anyway, that he
[53:19] wanted to write a book of remembrance
[53:20] and keep it before him to write all of
[53:22] your deeds in in that book of
[53:24] remembrance.
[53:26] And the thing about it is everyone
[53:27] that's written about in that book, God's
[53:28] going to take with him.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "And they shall be mine, sayith
[53:33] the Lord of host, in that day when I
[53:34] make up my jewels and I will spare them
[53:36] as a man spareth his own son that
[53:37] serveth me." He's talking about the
[53:38] people that are written in that book in
[53:40] that book of remembrance. And why is
[53:42] that? It's because you and I remember.
[53:46] We don't forget.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; If we're on a mountain, we remember
[53:50] &gt;&gt; that he's a good God.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's easy.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; But if we're in the valley, what do we
[53:55] do? We remember.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He's a good God.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; We don't suddenly forget when we're in
[54:01] the valley. We remember.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I'm on the mountain, I remember
[54:04] you're a good God. If I'm down in the
[54:06] valley, I remember you're a good God.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; I remember. Remember, if we're well,
[54:11] we're in good health. We remember God's
[54:13] a healer. Praise God. He's a healer. I'm
[54:14] in good health. He's a healer. I
[54:16] remember God's a healer.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; If we're sick, who is he?
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Not a healer anymore. No, he's a healer.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's a healer. If I'm sick,
[54:24] he's a healer. I remember he's a healer.
[54:26] I don't let Satan come into my mind and
[54:28] say, "Ah, maybe he's not. Maybe he's
[54:30] just left you." No, he hasn't left me.
[54:32] He's a healer.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what my body looks like,
[54:35] what it's telling me. He's a healer.
[54:38] If we have abundance, we have a lot.
[54:39] What do we say is he's our provider.
[54:41] Well, you're just saying that cuz you
[54:42] got everything. That's what Satan said
[54:44] about Job. Oh, he's just happy cuz
[54:46] you're blessing him. Take away all his
[54:48] stuff and he won't be happy anymore. So
[54:50] God said, you watch this. So he took
[54:51] away all his stuff and he was still
[54:53] happy. He said, "Though God slay me, yet
[54:55] will I trust him. The Lord gives, the
[54:56] Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of
[54:58] the Lord." He remembered he's a good
[54:59] God.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't just He didn't suddenly forget
[55:02] when times got tough. He didn't suddenly
[55:03] forget. And you and I, I said, we don't
[55:06] just forget when times get tough that
[55:07] he's a good God. We remember he's a good
[55:09] God. No matter how much the devil tries
[55:11] to tell us otherwise, we remember he's a
[55:13] good God. That's why when we have
[55:15] nothing, we still remember he's a
[55:16] provider, but you got nothing. Don't
[55:18] care. He's a provider.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; He provides all my needs. When we're
[55:22] surrounded by those that love us, we got
[55:24] a got a good group of friends and
[55:25] family. It's like we're we got all that
[55:27] we could need. We remember he's our
[55:29] comfort. Well, you don't really need him
[55:30] cuz you got good family, you got a
[55:31] fellowship, you got all this. There
[55:33] might be other times where we end up all
[55:34] alone. We still remember he's my
[55:36] comfort. Even in that's what he's my
[55:38] comfort. Whether I've got plenty,
[55:39] whether I've got nothing, he's he's
[55:41] still my comfort. Whether I've got
[55:42] friends around me, whether I don't, he's
[55:43] my comfort.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; We know we're in if we're in a storm, we
[55:47] don't just forget, well, he's left me.
[55:49] We remember he's the master of the
[55:51] storm.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; The disciples got in a storm and they
[55:54] got all flustered. They forgot who he
[55:55] was.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "How long must I suffer little
[55:58] faith?" He spoke to the wind, "Peace be
[56:00] still." When you're going through
[56:01] something, don't forget that God's your
[56:03] deliverer.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan come in and try and move
[56:06] your mind away so that you forget. Don't
[56:09] just remember. It's real simple. Just we
[56:11] just remember God's my deliverer.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; The next day when you're still not
[56:15] delivered, he's my deliverer. Every
[56:17] single day when you wake up, he's my
[56:18] deliverer. Doesn't matter what it looks
[56:20] like. And a time of peace. I remember
[56:22] he's the he's the prince of peace.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; But then in a time of war, he's the
[56:26] prince of peace. If there's war in my
[56:28] house, after there's all these things
[56:29] going on and it seems hard, he's the
[56:31] prince of peace. He's going to come in
[56:33] and bring peace.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Doesn't look like it. It doesn't matter.
[56:35] He's the prince of peace. I remember.
[56:37] That's what he said. I'm not going to
[56:39] forget it. In a time of war, I'm going
[56:40] to forget. I'm going to remember that
[56:41] he's the prince of peace. The Lord said
[56:43] when times get hard, he's he's already
[56:46] said in this, we remember. Oh, that's
[56:48] right. The Lord said in this world, I'll
[56:49] have tribulation, but don't worry. I've
[56:51] overcome the world. Just remember that.
[56:53] Don't suddenly forget that when it gets
[56:55] hard. Just remember, we remember that
[56:57] that if God's word says it, we believe
[56:59] it. That settles it.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; We remember that. That's right. I
[57:02] remember the word of God says it. What
[57:04] do I do then? I believe it. What happens
[57:06] then? That settles it. I remember. Easy.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Easy equation.
[57:12] Satan tries to reason something out with
[57:14] you. You say, "No, hang on. The word of
[57:15] God says this. I believe it. That
[57:17] settles it." The Bible says, "Resist the
[57:20] devil. He will flee from you. The best
[57:21] thing to do is remember the word of God.
[57:22] Apply it. The devil just has got nowhere
[57:24] to stand because he cuz he he can only
[57:27] he can only come and stand and and and
[57:29] get you if you say the word of God says
[57:31] it, but I'm not sure if I believe it.
[57:35] Then he can come in and have a go at you
[57:36] there. But if you say the word of God
[57:37] says it, I believe it. That settles it.
[57:39] He has to flee. Where can he go? What
[57:41] can he do?
[57:44] We remember that we should hide his word
[57:45] in our heart and meditate upon it day
[57:47] and night. We remember that. we
[57:48] remember. Well, if I want to like David,
[57:50] Lord, I want to I I I I love you so
[57:53] much. I want you to read your word and
[57:55] remember it so I know what it is. So
[57:56] then so that when things come up, I can
[57:58] apply your word. I people make so much
[58:00] effort to get a PhD in a certain thing
[58:02] and they learn all the equations,
[58:04] everything there is to do with that
[58:05] certain thing. We want a PhD in the word
[58:07] of God where we study the word of God so
[58:08] when we end up in situations we know
[58:10] which part of the word of God to apply.
[58:12] We don't want to end up there and not
[58:13] know what to do. We want to study the
[58:15] word of God. As David said, Lord, thy
[58:17] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[58:18] not sin against you that I can remember
[58:20] it. When a situation comes, I remember
[58:22] what your word says. And we remember
[58:24] that. He says, "If you love me, keep my
[58:25] commandments."
[58:26] &gt;&gt; We remember that. We don't just forget
[58:28] that. We say, "Lord, I remember you said
[58:30] to keep my commandments." We remember
[58:32] that every situation we got to act like
[58:33] a son or daughter of God. We reme we
[58:36] don't just forget one day that we're a
[58:37] that we're a son or daughter of God and
[58:39] just act in your old certain way. No, we
[58:40] remember when we wake up in the morning,
[58:42] I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[58:43] I remember. I'm not just going to forget
[58:45] like that slave that was ended up in
[58:47] America. Even though he was far from
[58:49] home, he remembered he was a son of a
[58:50] king. I remember I'm a son of a king.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't one day, He didn't one day wake
[58:55] up and forget. He remembered every
[58:56] single day. And that's what we want to
[58:58] do. Remember every single day that we're
[59:00] sons of the king. We remember that he
[59:02] watches us. We don't just go and oh
[59:04] well, no one will see this. We remember
[59:05] God sees us.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; We remember that he that he sees all
[59:10] that we do. So we want to be live right
[59:11] before him because we remember.
[59:14] We remember that he hears all that we
[59:16] think. So we want to keep our thoughts
[59:17] pure. We can't just think things and God
[59:19] doesn't hear it. He hears it. Brother
[59:21] Brham said his thoughts speak louder in
[59:23] heaven than do our words. So we remember
[59:24] that. So when our mind starts to think
[59:26] something it shouldn't, we remember.
[59:27] Hang on. God hears this.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; God hears this.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, you hear this. There's no point
[59:33] hiding anymore because I remember you
[59:35] hear this.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Cleanse me, oh God, from my secret
[59:38] faults. Lord, help me to think the right
[59:39] thought then, Lord. when there's no one
[59:41] else around, when it's just you and me.
[59:43] That's the hallmarks of a Christian man.
[59:44] It's just you and the Lord. No one else
[59:45] knows. That really is your Christian
[59:47] walk. It's not what everyone else sees.
[59:48] It's between It's what you and what you
[59:51] and God know together. That's really
[59:53] your Christian Christian walk. But we
[59:55] also remember that if we do wrong, we
[59:58] remember that we can ask him to forgive
[1:00:01] us our sins. And we remember that he's
[1:00:02] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[1:00:04] sins. We remember that. We don't let the
[1:00:06] devil come and say, "No, he doesn't
[1:00:07] actually forgive you." Oh, no. I
[1:00:09] remember that he does. I remember that
[1:00:11] if I ask for forgiveness, he and I
[1:00:13] confess it, he'll forgive me.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And I remember that not only that, he
[1:00:17] casts our sin into the sea of
[1:00:19] forgetfulness. I remember that. I don't
[1:00:21] forget that. I remember. And then then
[1:00:24] if we remember that, then we can move on
[1:00:26] and say, "I never even did in the first
[1:00:27] place." Satan tries to come at you with
[1:00:28] these past sins you've done. If they're
[1:00:30] under the blood, you say, "I can't
[1:00:31] remember a thing. I forget that."
[1:00:33] Because God said, "You can just move on
[1:00:35] from it. Just forget it. I've forgotten.
[1:00:37] You forget. Just move on.
[1:00:40] And we also remember that he told us to
[1:00:41] forgive others
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; and apply the same tactic to other
[1:00:45] people. Don't remember stuff that they
[1:00:47] did and bring it up and that. Forget it.
[1:00:50] Apply the same thing to others. If if
[1:00:53] you just forgive, forget, move on. Don't
[1:00:55] don't harbor things. I remember that
[1:00:56] they did that. Don't remember just
[1:00:58] remember good things.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Just remember good things. Don't
[1:01:02] remember any evil stuff. Just forget it.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Satan's the one that always wants you to
[1:01:06] remember bad things. He's always
[1:01:07] bringing it up, wanting you to remember.
[1:01:08] I remember what they did to you.
[1:01:09] Remember what they said to you? Remember
[1:01:10] what that person said? Forget it all.
[1:01:12] We're called to forget those sort of
[1:01:14] things. Don't remember them. Just forget
[1:01:15] them.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You can be sure of anything that if we
[1:01:18] confess our sins to the Lord, we want
[1:01:20] him to forget it.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And then we want to hold on to this
[1:01:25] other remembrance that someone else did
[1:01:26] something someone else did to us. Just
[1:01:28] forget it.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Don't remember any evil stuff. Just
[1:01:32] forget it all. That's I found that to be
[1:01:33] the best technique in my life is I just
[1:01:36] forget any evil. I just remember the
[1:01:37] good. Gets me in trouble sometime. Some
[1:01:39] sometimes cuz I remember, man, that was
[1:01:40] a good time, wasn't it? And I shouldn't
[1:01:42] say this, but Shannon will say, "That
[1:01:44] time, don't you remember this and that
[1:01:45] and that?" I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's
[1:01:46] right.
[1:01:48] I forgot all the bad stuff. You just
[1:01:50] remember the good stuff." Because we
[1:01:53] remember that that the Lord gave us an
[1:01:55] example. He said when you come to the
[1:01:56] altar, he said if you remember, he
[1:01:58] didn't say if you remember what someone
[1:02:00] else did to you
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; cuz you're supposed to forget that. He
[1:02:03] said if you remember that you've done
[1:02:05] something to someone else,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; go and make it right.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Not not ah I remember he did that. We
[1:02:12] don't remember that stuff. We forget it.
[1:02:14] That's why and Paul says, "Brethren, I
[1:02:17] count not myself to a reprehender, but
[1:02:19] this one thing I do, forgetting those
[1:02:21] things which are behind and reaching
[1:02:24] forth unto those things which are
[1:02:25] before, I press forward for the prize of
[1:02:27] the high calling of God in Christ
[1:02:29] Jesus."
[1:02:31] We want to forget.
[1:02:34] The devil always wants us to remember
[1:02:35] stuff from our past and and bring these
[1:02:37] things up. Just forget it. And we just
[1:02:40] want to Lord, we want to remember you.
[1:02:41] We'll remember your promises. You want
[1:02:43] to move forward into into the the the
[1:02:46] promises of the word of God. Move
[1:02:48] forward into all the things that he has.
[1:02:49] And and and if you've put everything
[1:02:50] under the mud, just forget it. Move on.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it.
[1:02:55] I want to share one more. That was that
[1:02:58] was my thought I had
[1:03:00] um about remembering and forging. Can I
[1:03:03] share one little testimony with you? Is
[1:03:04] that all right?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Shannon's looking at me.
[1:03:12] Okay, I want to I I was I I want to
[1:03:16] share this at the end because um I want
[1:03:17] to share this because um I spoke about
[1:03:20] this I think maybe three Wednesdays ago
[1:03:22] or four. I think it was a maybe it was a
[1:03:25] morning. You remember me talking about
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; So
[1:03:31] you all know but you know this I've been
[1:03:32] on that this um mission to make this
[1:03:36] film for about 12 years. And just to
[1:03:38] recap this one here and when I was at
[1:03:39] the dump you know this can was there and
[1:03:41] was going to boot it in. The Lord said
[1:03:42] pick up the can and um
[1:03:46] you know keep it never get rid of it.
[1:03:47] And I didn't know what it was but it
[1:03:49] looked and it was the you know the the
[1:03:51] same the the inside the can not in this
[1:03:54] one but it was a mint cake that Edmond
[1:03:56] Hillary ate on the top of Mount Everest.
[1:03:58] So and that was significant was the Lord
[1:04:00] had always said you know the this is the
[1:04:01] mountain you got to climb and you'll get
[1:04:03] to the top and those sorts of things.
[1:04:05] So, um,
[1:04:07] uh, and the date, I actually didn't get
[1:04:09] it, but I wrote the date 14th of the 7th
[1:04:11] on the inside of the can, which was when
[1:04:12] the Lord said, "Now start
[1:04:15] climbing to the summit." Does that make
[1:04:16] sense?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Um,
[1:04:20] and
[1:04:23] there So, the other Call me crazy, but I
[1:04:26] kind of am, but I think when the Lord
[1:04:27] does things, you can always there's
[1:04:29] they're always strange. like when the
[1:04:31] Lord not strange but but the they go
[1:04:36] outside the realms of probability a lot
[1:04:37] of the time they're not just a normal
[1:04:39] occurrence when the Lord's hand is on
[1:04:41] something you can see wow that looks
[1:04:42] like the hand of the Lord you know
[1:04:44] there's something bigger on it you know
[1:04:46] it's like if you feel like I should move
[1:04:47] to this place but you're not sure if the
[1:04:49] Lord wants you to go he will do all
[1:04:50] sorts of things to make it known that no
[1:04:52] this is my hand you can you can go and
[1:04:55] so um the date on that was 14th of the
[1:04:58] 7th And um I didn't time it this way,
[1:05:02] but from when I got up and spoke and
[1:05:04] then went down, it was 14 minutes and 7
[1:05:06] seconds when I shared that, which I the
[1:05:09] Lord always does things in twos, you
[1:05:10] know. So, but but
[1:05:15] now I've got to say this the right way
[1:05:17] and I think I will. this and in and with
[1:05:19] Shannon I it's always sort of been I've
[1:05:21] had this you know this idea to build to
[1:05:24] do this film and do that and Shannon's
[1:05:26] been very supportive all the time you
[1:05:27] know of me and everything I do so so if
[1:05:30] I'm going to do something she's going to
[1:05:31] support she supports me with a ro that
[1:05:33] way or that way so if I go and do that
[1:05:35] she'll support me in that
[1:05:37] not but the difference is she's not so
[1:05:40] much doing that she's doing this and I
[1:05:43] go and do that you know like okay we'll
[1:05:45] go and do that but it's not like I'm
[1:05:46] going to do that I'm going support you
[1:05:48] if you do that then we do that. If you
[1:05:50] do that we do that. But I it was always
[1:05:53] interesting to me because I thought you
[1:05:54] know the the and because I'd shared this
[1:05:57] the the Lord there's this idea that when
[1:06:00] the Lord calls someone he calls his wife
[1:06:02] brother Ramstead you know that you get
[1:06:03] sort of called together in a certain
[1:06:05] thing and and I thought it's kind of I
[1:06:09] haven't really had that
[1:06:12] like that with this film you know it's
[1:06:13] been Shannon's been very supportive
[1:06:15] don't get me wrong it's always been but
[1:06:16] just not that not not a little moment to
[1:06:18] go oh actually I want to do that as well
[1:06:20] sort of is that
[1:06:23] I got to tread carefully, man. I got to
[1:06:25] live with her.
[1:06:28] I got to go home tonight.
[1:06:32] But I want to explain it in the right
[1:06:33] way. So So it's understood, right?
[1:06:36] Okay. So we we haven't been away for a
[1:06:39] long time, so I wanted to go take her
[1:06:41] away. So we went to um Toppo um on the
[1:06:44] weekend. Just went for a couple of days
[1:06:46] that we could have off. And um we do a
[1:06:50] bit of running here and there just for a
[1:06:53] bit of fun. And um we were Shannon was
[1:06:56] driving cuz I still had to do a little
[1:06:58] bit of stuff on the way. But we got to
[1:07:01] this place is on the um
[1:07:04] at the start of Lake Topold near um
[1:07:06] Tudangi.
[1:07:09] And when we're about 5 minutes from this
[1:07:11] place, I said, "Oh, Shannon, there's a
[1:07:12] place up ahead of me that I would I
[1:07:14] actually want to stop at because I've
[1:07:16] always had this idea that there's a I've
[1:07:18] looked at it on the map, Google Maps,
[1:07:20] and I figured that if we park in this
[1:07:23] certain parking spot here, which I don't
[1:07:25] know if it's there, but it looks like it
[1:07:26] is on the map where the red starts by
[1:07:27] the road. If we park there, I figure we
[1:07:29] can run down this track there. We can
[1:07:31] run along the be uh like the the lake
[1:07:34] front there. We can cross over the
[1:07:36] eststerie there like through through
[1:07:38] where the lagoon is and then I think
[1:07:41] that's a there's a mount there like a
[1:07:44] big hill little mountain. I want to
[1:07:46] basically I'm telling her I want to go
[1:07:48] to the summit of that mountain real
[1:07:49] quick
[1:07:51] like it's about a 12 13k round trip or
[1:07:55] something like that but can we just pull
[1:07:56] over here real quick? I just want to
[1:07:58] let's do a quick run up to the top of
[1:08:00] this mountain and back.
[1:08:03] Right. So, she was not happy at me,
[1:08:07] but I kind of figured once we get to the
[1:08:08] other side there, there's a little
[1:08:09] township over there. There probably is a
[1:08:12] track that goes and up to the top of
[1:08:14] this mountain. So, we can go across and
[1:08:15] intercept the track and then go up the
[1:08:17] nice track. Man, was I wrong. So, that's
[1:08:21] the that's that's where I wanted to go
[1:08:23] up to the top of that. This is actually
[1:08:24] on the other side, but we were starting
[1:08:26] off on the other side there. This is the
[1:08:27] next day. So, I want to get to the top
[1:08:29] of that mountain because I like
[1:08:31] mountains. cuz I like to climb to the
[1:08:32] top of them. Now, if you're new in New
[1:08:36] Zealand, we have a thing called a trig,
[1:08:37] which is this thing here, which marks
[1:08:38] the highest point at any given piece of
[1:08:40] land. If you have a station or land,
[1:08:42] you'll have a trig. And
[1:08:45] um
[1:08:46] so we start the first bit is nice. We
[1:08:49] run along the the the down this nice
[1:08:52] open track and then we run along the the
[1:08:53] the waterfront. That's beautiful day.
[1:08:56] Everything's things are going well. Then
[1:08:57] we hit the bush and man, this is thick
[1:09:00] bush. I don't mind it because I'm a bit
[1:09:01] of a bush man from way back, but this is
[1:09:03] thick bush man. And I notice Shannon's
[1:09:05] getting quieter and quieter as we're
[1:09:07] running through this dense bush and I'm
[1:09:09] pulling branches out the way and stuff.
[1:09:11] Muddy would have loved it. But um yeah,
[1:09:14] we're going through and and I'm thinking
[1:09:16] to myself, man, she does not want to be
[1:09:17] here. And she's got these running like
[1:09:20] she's got her skirt then these running
[1:09:21] tights and they're being ripped by all
[1:09:22] the gor and the the um the
[1:09:26] supple jack and all sorts of stuff
[1:09:28] that's in there. and um and her brand
[1:09:30] new shoes, these white ones, they're
[1:09:31] full of they're covered in mud. She's
[1:09:33] like, "If I knew we were coming here, I
[1:09:35] would have bought my hiking shoes."
[1:09:38] So, and and we get over to the point on
[1:09:42] the where I think the track should be. I
[1:09:44] think I say the track's coming up here
[1:09:45] soon. All this hardness is going to be
[1:09:47] over and we're going to be able to go up
[1:09:48] to the summit in a nice track. So, we
[1:09:51] get to the end there and there is no
[1:09:53] track in sight. I'm like, man, it looks
[1:09:54] like we're the only ones ever in
[1:09:55] civilization to ever set foot in this
[1:09:57] place.
[1:09:58] Nobody's here. So there's no track.
[1:10:01] There's no nothing. So
[1:10:04] we say I say I say, "Look, what do you
[1:10:08] want to do? Do you want to do you want
[1:10:10] to head up to the summit or do we turn
[1:10:11] back and we could go back to the town
[1:10:13] and then run back down the road?"
[1:10:17] In my heart, I hope she'd say, "Go to
[1:10:18] the summit." Cuz I'm like, "Man, I've
[1:10:19] come this far. I don't want to not make
[1:10:21] it to the summit." and she she very
[1:10:25] enthusiastically said, "Yes, I'd love to
[1:10:28] run up to the summit.
[1:10:32] Lead me on."
[1:10:35] Okay. I wasn't that enthusiastic, but
[1:10:36] she managed to get a
[1:10:41] well. Okay. Like, we've been going for
[1:10:43] maybe 45 minutes by this time and
[1:10:45] through all this bush and that and then
[1:10:47] the the um so we were sort of down by
[1:10:50] where my head is behind there. where to
[1:10:52] go up to the from that point all the way
[1:10:54] up to the top. It was a bit of a hike
[1:10:55] through all this bush. There was no
[1:10:56] track and I've kind of got my I didn't
[1:10:58] come prepared. I had my phone with a
[1:10:59] Google map and it sort of could tell you
[1:11:00] which way to go. But I kind of being a
[1:11:02] bushman, I know my way around the bush.
[1:11:06] I figure we just go we'll go flat and
[1:11:09] then when we start going in that
[1:11:10] direction, we'll be going up a hill and
[1:11:12] we'll just keep going up a hill till we
[1:11:13] get to the top of the hill. That sort of
[1:11:15] made sense to me. So, so we go up there
[1:11:19] and then and then which I hope this will
[1:11:23] be there. We get right to the top of
[1:11:24] this thing and there's a trigger at the
[1:11:26] top which is kind of neat. You know,
[1:11:27] there's something there to mark. Okay,
[1:11:28] this is the top and that's actually the
[1:11:29] that little marker on the ground is the
[1:11:31] summit. So, they put that in then they
[1:11:33] build a trigger around this little
[1:11:34] marker. So, so, so we're at the summit
[1:11:38] and then people being people, they love
[1:11:40] to graffiti and I thought, oh, people
[1:11:42] have probably graffitied and scratched
[1:11:43] names all through the underneath. So, I
[1:11:45] get underneath the the trig there and
[1:11:47] look around. And then I pointed out to
[1:11:50] Shannon, I said, "Oh, look, there's um
[1:11:53] look that there's your name written up
[1:11:55] here and there's your name on the behind
[1:11:59] the trig there." And and we we go up a
[1:12:03] little closer to it and it's her name,
[1:12:05] but it's also says 81. Shannon saw this.
[1:12:09] Shannon 81. She said, "That's so
[1:12:11] strange. That's the year I was born,
[1:12:13] 1981.
[1:12:16] And I don't know, call me crazy, okay,
[1:12:20] but what are the odds? We've just got
[1:12:22] the summit thing in our mind and the
[1:12:24] law's busy sort of Okay, now put I'll
[1:12:28] just cut to the chase. Shannon said,
[1:12:29] "This is weird. I wonder what that
[1:12:30] means." I said, "You know what it means?
[1:12:33] It means that we climbed this whole
[1:12:35] summit for you. This is so you could
[1:12:37] come and realize your name's on the top
[1:12:38] of the summit. Shannon 1981. When you
[1:12:41] were the the year you were born, your
[1:12:43] name was up here. Another Shannon the
[1:12:46] other side of the world walked all the
[1:12:47] way up here, wrote their name and wrote
[1:12:49] 81 and walk back down again. And and
[1:12:52] it's just one of those moments where you
[1:12:53] feel like, you know, this has been this
[1:12:54] is so uncanny. It feels like the Lord
[1:12:56] the Lord calling I want to call you to
[1:12:58] the summit as well. It's not just Isaac
[1:13:00] going up, but I'm calling you to the
[1:13:01] summit. And there you are, Shannon 81.
[1:13:04] And Shannon said, "Yeah, I think it sort
[1:13:05] of means I was born for this." I'm like,
[1:13:08] "Oh, you got me there."
[1:13:13] Okay, I might be crazy, but the the the
[1:13:15] the whole playing out of the situation
[1:13:18] was like I think when I got back down,
[1:13:20] we we were back down at the back down at
[1:13:23] the this was where we ran across and
[1:13:24] there's the mount on the back there up
[1:13:26] at the top. I pointed to Shannon, I
[1:13:29] said, "We ran all the way up that hill
[1:13:30] just for you."
[1:13:35] But I thought I wanted to share that
[1:13:37] just because the Lord does these little
[1:13:38] things to, you know, and and because I
[1:13:40] shared the thing a few weeks ago. I
[1:13:42] wanted to just share that because I
[1:13:44] think when the Lord does things, it's
[1:13:45] kind of like, you know, when it's the
[1:13:46] Lord, like the the the balance of
[1:13:48] probabilities are just too strange that
[1:13:49] you think, okay, I think the Lord's
[1:13:51] trying to speak to me. And I think, you
[1:13:53] know, in your own life, you know, we
[1:13:54] begin to realize we serve a supernatural
[1:13:56] God where we bump into people. There's
[1:13:58] unusual things and we can start to see
[1:13:59] the hand of God move in our life. But
[1:14:01] don't be shy to sort of to just look out
[1:14:04] for the hand of God in your life and
[1:14:05] look out for his leadership because he
[1:14:07] does he does want to lead. He hasn't
[1:14:09] forgotten you. He wants to lead you and
[1:14:10] guide you in your life and and give you
[1:14:12] purpose, give you direction, let you
[1:14:13] know which way you should go and and
[1:14:15] give you answers to things. He doesn't
[1:14:16] just want to leave you there, confuse
[1:14:17] you, give you answers. He'll show you
[1:14:18] the right way to go. Amen. So, let's um
[1:14:21] let's just stand. Um maybe I'll just
[1:14:24] lead us in a a song this evening. Let's
[1:14:26] um
[1:14:28] let's stand and we'll just start. Can I
[1:14:29] ask some musicians to come up?
[1:14:48] Amen. We'll just um
[1:14:51] uh there's a song um I'm this sing I'm
[1:14:54] amazed that you love me. But just as
[1:14:55] they start playing, we just we'll just
[1:14:56] um pray this evening.

[1:15:09] different paths that I've been on, I

[1:16:02] I'm amazed
[1:16:05] that you love me.
[1:16:08] For I'm amazed
[1:16:12] how you care.
[1:16:16] Through your precious
[1:16:18] blood. I found pardon.
[1:16:22] Oh, and my sins
[1:16:25] are washed. They're all washed away. All
[1:16:30] my sins
[1:16:32] are washed away. Oh, no one knew. No one
[1:16:38] knew how alone I was feeling.

[1:16:49] hide.
[1:16:51] Though I love said my life was fine
[1:16:55] without you.
[1:16:58] I was covering up the secret tears I
[1:17:03] cried.
[1:17:05] Then one day someone told me of your
[1:17:10] mercy
[1:17:12] and the love you showed on a hill called
[1:17:16] Calvary.
