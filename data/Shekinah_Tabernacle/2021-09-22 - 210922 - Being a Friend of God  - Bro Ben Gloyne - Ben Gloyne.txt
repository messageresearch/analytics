Hallelujah hey man it's great to be in the house of God tonight great to see everyone here praise the Lord amen I trust you'll feel at home and welcome and praise the Lord amen we're going to go to um we're gonna go to James chapter two sorry if all the young people who are at the banquet I I I spoke on this I just couldn't get it off my heart so the best way to get off my heart is to tell you about it and then we can move on so um I just feel to uh continue on in this vein uh about being a friend of God so I you know as always things always come out differently so uh don't don't um hit snooze if you're there so in James 2 and 23 and we're just going to read one one verse here James 2 and 23. um and it's a prayer night tonight as well so um we have a time of prayer after this so James 2 and 23 it says here and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was reputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God Amen my what a what a thing to be known as right may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight so I want to talk about being a friend of God you know we um I don't know how you view God uh many people have a very wrong idea of her of him even even brother Branham would say uh early on in his Christian experience he'd say you know he says I used to think that God was angry with me but Christ loved me and I come to find out that Christ is the very Heart Of God he is God's heart Jesus Christ is God's heart now love overcome love hides sin or gets rid of sin God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen so he so brother babe used to think that God was angry with him but Christ loved him and you know what a what a sad condition to be in if you think God is angry at you you know you know imagine waking up every morning thinking this this being that you're going to pray to is mad at you you know but I'm so thankful that we don't have to live under that with that kind of relationship God God doesn't want us to think of him that way it's really man's idea of God or the devil perverting who God is to the people that makes people think that God is angry you know at them but God is not angry at people you know remember Jesus Christ is the very Heart Of God he wants a real relationship a love relationship with you not one that's just based on like a job or some kind of servanthood he doesn't want somebody wants sonship Sons and Daughters of God made co-equal with him that's what he wants and you know so so I trust you do not think that God is angry at you you don't think of him some angry father that's always correcting and lecturing and beating down and that's not the kind of God of that that's not the god of the scripture that's not the god of the message either he no it's it's it's Sovereign Grace it's divine grace being projected you know you know it's the love of God being expressed that's really what you know that's the heart of the scripture is divine love so he used to think of God being angry with him but he found you know Christ loving him he found out Christ is the very Heart Of God so I trust that you'll um uh uh you you you'll see that you know he's not a angry fathers I'm just laboring this point because many people are scared of God they think of you know people are terrified of going into Rapture because they're going to stand before an Angry God but you know no that's the most exciting thought to be you know these bodies have changed and then we get to see Jesus you know some people are terrified how's it going to work out over there well if it if it's fine here it's going to be fine there so you know if you've given your whole life to him he's changed you transformed you made you a new creature in him amen the love of God has shed abroad in your heart it'll be the same over there right so it's good to get these things settled here that you'll be right over there hey man so you know friendship can be you know has has many different layers and um you know we know that a true husband or wife they should be best friends with each other yeah first and foremost you should be enjoy hanging out with your spouse like me if I have the whole day with Christine that's that's a great day that's an awesome day well if we just sit on the couch and have coffee after coffee it's a brilliant day yeah yeah tick I'm I'm a happy man because I get to hang out with my best friend amen and and that's just gotten more and more since since I've been married to whatever it's just got better and richer and that's how it should be so so it's not just a kind of a casual kind of a friendship but it's a but but you know a real to be a friend of God you know he wants to have a real good friendship with you you know he doesn't we know some friendships are difficult he's had a difficult friendship before where it's actually all kind of one-sided you know and it's normally because one of the friends is very insecure they're not secure on their friendship you know they'll get insecure if you don't call them enough or text them enough or and you know invite them enough you know they see photos of you status of photos of you doing something with someone else and they get offended why didn't you invite me on that trip why why am I not in that selfie you know you know and it's an insecure kind of a friendship now our God is not insecure he's very secure he knows who he is he knows he made all things he knows from the end from the beginning he's very secure right so so it's only can be our side is insecure but our Lord wants us to be secure in this friendship he doesn't want us to be insecure well what is that insecurity am I going to make it am I not going to make it he wants to get that out of your head or get that out of your heart he wants you to know that you know that you know that you're going and you're gonna make it because remember he made it for us at down Calvary but he wants that Victory to come into your life that you could just have such a peace in your life no matter what happens you're under the blood and you are his child and he's your God that's what he wants you to know not guessing but knowing right because you know when Jesus hung there on Calvary and he purchased the Redemption of of Adam's Fallen race of you and I he carried our sins up his shoulders up there you know that day of Calvary he was our sin offering he was our lamb when he said it is finished he wasn't doubting it was finished or not it was finished he knew it was paid in full he knew that this wasn't just a down payment or some interest or you know no it was paid in full that all of Adam's Fallen race could go free I mean they could be redeemed back to God so in his mind the sentence question is settled but as it settled in your mind Hallelujah right see it's going to be settled in your mind that he paid it all for you right because if it's not settled in your mind you'll try and earn the friendship buy things you can do but that's not how it works no he paid it all he just receive it and enjoy it and walk in it amen right because he paid it all we you know he knew that we could not keep our half of the friendship right because remember he put Adam on condition if they'll you know don't eat this tree if you do this is gonna happen he failed you know he gave he gave Israel the law don't do this if you do this you'll do you know this is going to happen they failed but with Abraham was unconditional Covenant I've made you father of Nations and he made him father of Nations and the Covenant that we're under under the blood of Jesus Christ is unconditional right he puts a faith in our heart to fulfill the word right that's not nothing we could do but we're going to surrender ourselves completely to him right we can't hold anything back you're gonna give it all yeah amen and let him come and be not just savior but Lord amen amen of your life let him control you let his word govern you above all things above how you feel what you think the things you know let the word govern you amen so you know some some friendships are very insecure you're like you never text me you never call me you know and it and it feels like it's just work you got to try and maintain this friendship and you've got to be careful how you you know act around that person act around that friend because you're going to offend them if you do something wrong you can't be yourself necessarily you know that's not a real friendship you know a real friendship is you can be yourself what's in all you can be yourself and they enjoy you for you right they don't enjoy you for for some idea of who you are they enjoy you for you that's a real friendship you don't have to put on a Persona you don't have to try and dress up or impress them or or use a different kind of vocabulary you can be yourself right that's a real kind of friendship amen and that's the kind of friendship that God wants with you and I he wants us to be ourselves remember this remember the gospel is not like a cookie cutter kind of thing or just a machine that God puts us in a mold and we come out we're all just all the same you know doing the same speaking the same and you know having the same kind of character no he made you because he wanted to be a friend with you so if you're so if you're very loud he enjoys a loud friend if you're quiet he enjoys a quiet friend if you're somewhere in the middle he enjoys that kind of a friend but because he wants to be you he wants to be a friend with you he made you to be you if he didn't want you to be you who he would have made you someone else there's no mistakes with God right so you know a real friend you enjoy that person for who they are not what they have many people will be your friend because you throw money around those aren't friends they just want a free drink or something that's what they're after they're not really friends I had friends like that in the world wasn't too good amen but real friends will stick with you yeah amen bro you know the Bible says that a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity so a friend loveth at all times now our lord Jesus the Bible says when we were his enemy he died for us so he was our friend when we were his enemy we weren't even friends we were enemies because of sin nature Made Us totally contrary to him so when we were has that when we were against him he loved us at all times he loved you when you were lost he loved you and you were trying to please him out of your own Works he still loved you he loved you when you failed he loved you when you said the wrong thing he loved you when you put your foot out of the line he did all kinds of wrong things and you're eating yourself up saying I can't believe I did that and but we know he's saying lord well he's not praying because he knows but he's like maybe they just learn and grow and become more like me right but you know he loves you at all times a real friend will love him in the good times you're loving the bad times or she'll loving the bad times and the in between times when you're not doing your best they're still their best they still love you anyway right so our lord Jesus his love is constant it's not based on anything see his love does not change based on our what we do yeah that's right our love I could I could know you I mean or hear about you say you are the greatest person in all the world or vice versa I can hear about you and so I'm staying a mile away from that person I need a restraining order you know I don't I've never met them but they're that scary I don't want to know them so I've got virtually no love for you right human love but then when I meet you and you begin to talk with me and we do stuff together I say man this person's awesome and what happens my love for you goes up right it goes up based on what you do how you treat me but then God's love doesn't change that way his love is constant praise the Lord and I'm so glad that that's that is our way otherwise he'll be like he's not coming into my presence I'll be honest but you know but our Lord our Lord's love is is constant it's great it's far above human love that changes like the weather amen amen now Friends of the same character come together birds of a feather flock together right so those of the same spirit will gather themselves together I can't remember who said it but but if you want to see who you are see who your friends are right because your friends show Who You Are right so if your friends uh you're a bit that way but if your friends are awesome well maybe you're awesome too because birds of a feather flock together see the character of your friends and you see your own character because birds of a feather flock together oh my so so the Lord wants to be friends with those who are like him and the only way you can have that true friendship is if his own Spirit comes into you changes your nature and now it's him living and not you praise the Lord but see his friendship wins us over to become his friend right because what happens is Once Upon a Time Calvary was just a story right it was just a historical maybe happen story The Resurrection who knows you know but then one day he came and met you and you know the tomb's open and empty not because you see a photo on Google but because you've met the resurrected one right so so he wins your friendship over by proving himself who he is to you and then then once you see him that way how can you not give your whole life amen amen as he heals the sick raises the dead you know castes out Devils how can you not just say Lord you're awesome I want to be like you change my heart to be like your word Lord amen Proverbs 22 and 11 says he that love loveth pureness of heart for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friends so those who love the pureness of heart who loves the pureness of heart amen we don't love Shady deals or things that are perverse or not right we love the pureness of heart I mean so for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend so what comes out of their mouth the king himself will be their friend and when I read that I thought thought of the syrophoenician woman that Greek woman who came and she had a daughter grievously vexed with the devil and she came to the Lord she had a faith that she knew if she just got to him amen that that Spirit would be cast out she just had to get to him but you know and and her faith faced a lot of obstacle well she faced a lot of obstacles because the disciples said go away and even Jesus himself said to her well said to his disciples to tell her you know I'm not even sent to her she's not even no this is this is wrong you're not welcome you know but so she had obstacles but her faith had no obstacles she her faith carried her through those things and she said you know I'm not even you know you know um the Lord called her a dog saying you know you're not even meet for the you know you know the crumbs just go down to the dogs and all those things and calling her a dog but then she said true Lord but at least the dogs get their Crumbs from the table I may be butchering the scripture but we but you know what I mean right and so so her her lips had Grace on them because you came with the right approach right she came in humbleness of heart right and he said for the saying you know you'll find your daughter as well right so the king became her friend praise the lord we want to have that kind of friendship don't we we said Lord I have this need and even if he seems to say no and knows as good as a yes right and maybe cut us very deep hurt us a lot we maybe have a lot of sadness associated with it but if he says no we can still rejoice amen right that's real Faith yeah when you've when you've done all you can but yet it seems like your prayers not answered but you still love them anyhow that's real Faith amen amen maybe it's quite a mouthful to say but it's true right we don't have faith just because he answers prayer brother Ram says it's easy to have faith when you see mountains moving but when nothing seems to happen and you still love him anyhow amen that's real faith I want to have that kind of faith amen you know a friend can come and really talk to another friend about deep issues some things that can cut a real friend feels they have the Liberty they can come to you and talk to you about things they don't just keep the friendship surface they can go down into real meaty things that are going on they can really just say it out because they're not afraid to lose the Friendship if you keep a friendship surface level it's because your friendship's not a real friendship it's just an acquaintance you can say hey buddy buddy hey friend but it's just surface and because a real surface friendship is no deep connection you know it's just a it's just an acquaintance you know but if but many people keep things surfaces because they're afraid the Friendship might fall apart or they're even afraid to go to a deeper friendship but the thing is a real friend can just speak things straight and they know their friend will actually be able to receive it it says in Proverbs 27 and 6 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful so faithful are the wounds of a friend so the wounds of a friend as if they come to you and they say hey why'd you do that I saw how you treated that person I see pride in your life something's not quite right here you're the D you've changed how you speak to people's different hey your attitude something's crept into your life oh yes you know they can really and and that's wounding that's wounding but but any surgery leaves a wound any any surgery even even pinhole surgery there's still a lot of pain there yeah because the needles have been in and things have moved around and you know there's a wound but there's still a surgery had to take place and when a friend can go to a friend and say hey good that's not right we have to talk about this and a real friend will sit there and talk till the Matter's done doesn't matter if they get better they're going to say no no hold on we need to really talk and then pray this through yes see and that's why the law can come with his word if you're a real friend he can come to you and say hey I'm not looking at anyone in particular when I say this yeah you're prideful brother yo you become arrogant you've lost your love for people you've hardened your heart you know you've you think you're above everyone you know look at how you treat people you think you're holier than now yeah he'll come to you and what does he do he wants to actually cut the devil up from your life you know he said he why why are you harboring that complex why are you holding on to that pain you know I need to do some surgery the Lord but because he's your friend he can come to and actually talk to you in that manner because he loves you right a real friend that loves won't let their friend just go off and go on and to sin they'll say hold on this is not right and if you want if you won't listen to me I'm going to get some heavier artillery I'll get my I'll get our parents involved I'll get someone else involved because I love you you know because even Cain asked God am I My Brother's Keeper and yes you are yes we are our Brother's Keeper if you see some if you see me go wrong please talk to me about it thank you I'm glad Brother Paul's got my back see he's my friend brother and Paul's my friend some of you I'm not sure yet but hey we need to work on this all right we're going to do some outings or something all right but you know but it should be that way irrespective of office blah blah blah no that doesn't really matter oh man friendship goes beyond that remember to respect to be a respecter of persons is sin she said well I can't talk to that person because they're that personality that's respecting them but I can talk to the other person about that's fine no that's respecting one person above another we should treat each other the same respect officers all those things but hey if I if if my foot's out of line come talk to me about it please I know I'm serious I'm not saying this flippingly I mean it right and then I'll say actually thank you actually value me as a good friend amen amen now a real friend knows the nature of the other friend Abraham that was our opening scripture was he said that he was a you know he's called the friend of God now brother Brown would say and who is this he'd say he'd say what if Abraham would have took what it looked like 25 years waiting for a promise that God gave him why he'd never had the baby that have never they'd never have um been the father of little Isaac but he believed God's word and wouldn't turn it loose but he watered it day and night strong giving praise unto God oh when Sarah was saying honey it's been 25 years ago since the promise was made here I'm nearly a hundred he'd say praise God we're going to have it anyhow because God said so and that settles it that's right he knowed the nature of God because he was a friend of God so he knew the nature of God that when God gives a promise he's going to fulfill that promise well because it was a revelation to Abraham they're going to have the promised son so because it was a revelation he he and he knew God is a god of his word he knew God was going to fulfill that because he knew the nature of God because he was a friend of God I trust we know God above the letter right I trust we know God above just but other band's voice on tape right but we know the voice behind the voice we see the heart of God Amen being expressed because a lot of people who don't know the heart of God they'll take isolated quotes and scriptures take it totally out of context and away they go but those who know the True Heart Of God don't get swayed by those things because they know the whole character of God Amen amen amen praise the Lord amen it's like for example there was a there was a Lutheran Minister during the Nazi era and he actually was killed by the Nazis he was a he was a German by the name of a Dietrich Bonhoeffer and and and here's a Lutheran Minister very smart man and and he was he was there in the Lutheran Church when the Lutheran Church got swung into Nazism and he stood dead against it and because the Nazis were trying to get the church on board not because they were Christian at all but because they wanted the control because the Lutheran Church even even Luther's Bible had a massive sway over the German Nation because he unified the German language it was a very powerful you know part of their history and so they knew if they could swing the Lutheran Church into Nazism they had the country and so so little by little they did because that Spirit came in and just swung them into it because at first they would have you know you know within the Lutheran Church there there were there were Jewish believers who became Christians but they're Jewish by Blood but they became Christians then the Nazis came in and they and they and they and they tried to make the church change their change your list of beliefs saying you cannot have Jewish Christians they are not allowed in the Lutheran church anymore but he stood dead against this verse so but what the Nazis did is they found a bit of Luther's writings where he was actually anti-semitic and they blasted that Across the Nation saying look Luther said this therefore we should do this but it didn't sway people like uh Bonhoeffer because he knew all of Luther's writings so he knew the whole heart of Luther right so if you really know the whole heart of God yes or the whole heart of the message you don't get swayed by isolated quotes and things that are taken out of context she has to sway you out of it you see this you know so we've got to know the heart of God Amen amen right but unfortunately other people they said oh really he said that then it swung it into them but that Spirit had to come and do what it did but anyway he died he was actually he was actually executed by the Nazis at the end of the war for standing against what they were doing but you see because he really knew all of that Luther taught all of his writings he wasn't swayed by isolated quotes yeah and it should be the same thing with us if we really know the heart of God then isolated parts of the message won't sway us or isolated scriptures right amen so we've got to know the nature of God now sometimes you know if we really know the nature of God we can rest when God appears to be silent right we can rest when he appears to be silent we can trust no matter what happens if we've made Brothers one of the most powerful things in the world is a full committed God when he fully commits something to God when you father give it to him like a sacrifice that's powerful because now it's in God's hands amen and he can do what he sees as the best thing to do amen and if we're really his friend and know his nature we can rest at whatever happens in life you know he has our best interest in mind this is not just sitting back like a fatalistic kind of idea like what will be will be no if your life is in his hands completely then what comes you can rest in it good and bad you can rest in that amen so I think I'm gonna just wrap it up there because this is a prayer night but I want to ask you the question as your friendship with God now now a good friend you love to be around it's not work you enjoy there presence you enjoy their company you and and a good friendship is if you can basically you know you spend time with that friend and you may not see them for however long it could be years even and then you see them again it's just like you hit pause and now you put play again and you're back together that's a good friendship right it's not like Oh Where Do We Go From Here and where do we no no it's like you never were apart yeah because you're a good friend it's the same thing with us and God now we should never be apart from him right but but but but we can actually enjoy we you know a real good friend enjoys his presence it's not you know a friendship you got to work at so it's not you know if if you your relationship with the Lord is it takes work like it takes work to read the Bible or if it takes work or effort to come to church or it's work or effort to pray or listen to the message that's not the friendship that God wants with you he wants you to enjoy it just like a real good friend that you enjoy their presence you love to be around them it's like when you open the scripture you enjoy it you know you pray you enjoy it you know you come to church you enjoy it you long to do it because you want to be in his presence you and right so so I trust that that is how your friendship is with him it's not work right it's not something well it's expected of me you're like a friend that takes work well it's expected me I need to text him today you look at whatsapp now I'm not saying I do this some people do they look at the words happen they say where's the last time I messaged my friend this friend because if I don't measure them within three days they're not going to be happy with me you know it's not that kind of Friendship with God it's because you want to right it's like sometimes now I'm not saying this happens to me but you know you get a call on the phone and you see the name and you've got to steady yourself before you answer these are those kind of phone calls some people some that's like a phone call God's trying to get your number trying to try to get your attention I trust you don't cringe when it's when it's when it's ringing for you when the word has come to your address and wants your attention and wants to God wants to speak to you I trust you don't cringe and say oh hi you know I trust I trust that's not your relationship with the Lord it should be as soon as it rings yes Lord praise the Lord you know Hallelujah that's how it should be with you and God right so if you don't have that kind of relationship change your relationship with the Lord praise God he hasn't changed it's our approach to him so I pray that you think about your relationship with him is it out of fear is it out of well I feel I have to do this to maintain some kind of relationship and it takes work or is it a joy and you love him and you can be yourself Hallelujah and he he can be himself Hallelujah and you enjoy each other's presence and it's not work to be a Christian it's a joy I trust that that is your relationship with the Lord tonight that you're a friend of God like Abraham was amen amen let's have the musicians tonight before we go to prayer amen God bless you friends and I want to sing that song uh as a dear penis for the water because there's that verse there you are my friend and you are my brother even though you are my king I love that you're my friend
