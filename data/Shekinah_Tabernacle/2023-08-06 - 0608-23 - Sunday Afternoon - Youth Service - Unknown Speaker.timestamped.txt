[18:32] we're gonna
[18:34] um kind of imprompt except we did do one
[18:37] practice round and this was our um so
[18:39] this was our uh lesson this morning it's
[18:42] a little bit well
[18:45] we've we've changed it a little bit can
[18:47] you hold this for a second
[18:49] I'm going to be reading the script
[18:53] um so thank you
[18:55] um
[18:55] so you know how Jesus used Parables to
[18:59] tell a lesson and
[19:01] that was kind of the thought my my
[19:03] beginning thought and
[19:06] um then it kind of turned into a little
[19:08] bit of a play so
[19:11] anyways I hope you enjoy
[19:13] um this you'll get from it and um if you
[19:18] put on your spiritual jackets as brother
[19:20] Marcus
[19:22] um yeah as the brother says
[19:25] um you'll you'll get the gist behind it
[19:27] is about by by Grace we are saved right
[19:36] okay so this is Christina
[19:40] AKA Christian
[19:43] um I'm gonna tell this story
[19:48] this Story begins with a Christian named
[19:50] Christina and the devil having a
[19:52] conversation
[19:53] Christina said I got a ticket last night
[19:57] I gave my heart to Jesus and I got a
[19:59] ticket into heaven
[20:01] she's got a ticket
[20:05] but you know what the you know what the
[20:07] devil always does whenever you you get
[20:09] you have an experience and
[20:12] there's always somebody sneaking around
[20:14] we're ready to tell you that's not true
[20:17] so um I was going to read first Peter 5
[20:20] 8 which is what happened
[20:23] be vigilant because your adversary the
[20:27] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[20:31] seeking who whom he may defer
[20:35] and the devil said
[20:37] you don't actually believe that it's
[20:39] just a trick you won't make it if I can
[20:42] stop you
[20:44] oh yeah there's Christine
[20:49] um where was I
[20:51] um Christina said but I'm a good person
[20:53] my parents taught me to read my Bible
[20:55] and pray every day I've got good morals
[20:57] I do good things I'm I'm a good
[20:59] Christian
[21:00] but the devil said
[21:02] there's a lot of good people out there
[21:03] and they're going to Straight to Hell
[21:05] where I want them
[21:06] but Chris so Christina got desperate
[21:09] really desperate and she prayed
[21:11] and she prayed and she prayed some more
[21:14] until she knew that she had surrendered
[21:16] everything to the Lord and God gave her
[21:19] an assurance and a confirmation of where
[21:21] her journey would take her
[21:23] but do you think the devil was done
[21:26] do you think the devil was done
[21:30] no he said okay you think you gotta
[21:33] figure it out but you know how he likes
[21:35] to be all sneaky right
[21:37] one of his favorite tricks is to
[21:39] distract
[21:40] so he snuck up on Christina when she
[21:43] wasn't completely focused and said
[21:46] I'm gonna get that ticket from you I'll
[21:48] just steal your joy
[21:50] oh steal some more joy
[21:54] yeah
[21:55] well steal your happiness
[21:58] I'll steal your peace you know what he
[22:00] does
[22:01] and he ran away laughing but first he's
[22:03] got a rip of two-thirds of the ticket
[22:06] away
[22:09] because that's exactly what the devil
[22:10] does when when we have an experience
[22:13] hello
[22:15] so Christina got on her knees and asked
[22:18] God forgive for forgiveness for
[22:20] listening to the wrong voice as all
[22:22] Christians must when they make mistakes
[22:24] she opened her Bible and found Ephesians
[22:27] 2 verse 8 and 9. Fool by grace
[22:32] and none of your cells it is a gift of
[22:35] God no works with any Manchester best
[22:39] yeah
[22:40] So eventually because there's too many
[22:43] times like this that we can't tell the
[22:45] tell the whole story like ever a whole
[22:47] life story in 10 minutes but Christina
[22:50] finally made um she finally got to the
[22:53] Pearly Gates
[22:54] and the angel at the gate asked to see
[22:56] her ticket
[22:59] and Christina started to weep
[23:03] she said I was given my ticket I've held
[23:05] it close but the devil came when I
[23:07] wasn't watching and ripped off
[23:08] two-thirds of my ticket and now I only
[23:10] have this I've done the best that I
[23:12] could to take care of it but I don't I
[23:14] don't know if you can let me in I was
[23:15] reading the other day in Ephesians 2
[23:17] verse 8 and it says that by Grace were
[23:19] saved so I was wondering if there'd be
[23:21] Mercy for me that maybe I could still
[23:23] come in
[23:26] and meanwhile
[23:28] the devil's Advocates came behind
[23:30] Christina waving the pieces of the
[23:32] ticket they had stolen from Christina's
[23:34] ticket trying to taunt her with fear and
[23:36] lies only the devil knows how to do but
[23:39] the angel said I need to read some
[23:41] instructions first
[23:43] and gabes are Gabe's is going to read
[23:45] the instructions
[23:46] [Music]
[23:54] go and bring forth fruit and that your
[23:58] fruit should remain there whatsoever he
[24:02] shall ask of the father in my name he
[24:06] may give it you amen it was him that
[24:10] chose us right
[24:11] so the angel said
[24:13] to give me everybody give me the pieces
[24:17] of your tickets and we're gonna lay it
[24:18] out and see see where um you know you
[24:21] know when you go to a play or you go to
[24:23] you get in a plane they tell you okay
[24:26] you're on road D4 because you've got
[24:28] that written on your ticket right
[24:30] so
[24:31] um I can't really I can't show you it
[24:34] right now come stand up we're not
[24:36] actually gonna do what we did in the
[24:38] Sunday school class because nobody can
[24:39] really see it but if you unfold this
[24:42] is the two-thirds the devil took
[24:45] and this is the third that she had left
[24:48] just hang on I'll show you the I'll show
[24:50] you what the devil got it was his um
[24:53] his seating
[24:55] and this is what it said once you lay it
[24:58] out
[25:01] and what's that
[25:04] pardon me behind us
[25:07] oh sorry yeah can you see I'm sorry
[25:12] if you laid out all the pieces that the
[25:14] devil had taken this is what it said
[25:17] and and then show us what what you had
[25:20] at the Pearly Gates
[25:32] thank you
[25:37] that's it by Grace we are saved
[25:42] [Applause]
[25:51] um
[25:52] I thought it the second um the second
[25:54] part of the verse had a really fitting
[25:56] line and I've been meaning to sing it
[25:58] for a while
[26:12] foreign
[26:20] if you listen to the
[26:23] the words of the second
[26:26] verse it's really fitting because we
[26:29] know
[26:30] we know how the story ends even though
[26:32] the enemy might not know we know and
[26:37] that's our Assurance right
[26:43] [Music]
[27:00] oh
[27:13] [Music]
[27:15] the weapon may be formed but it won't
[27:18] prosper
[27:22] in the darkness fall when the Darkness
[27:25] Falls it won't prevail

[35:18] me Lord I want to ask you to be with us
[35:21] in this meeting in the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:23] amen
[35:32] um
[35:35] here we go
[35:37] amen
[35:39] I have a scripture here that I'm gonna
[35:42] read
[35:43] some Isaiah 6
[35:48] he says in the year that the King Josiah
[35:51] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[35:54] throne high and lifted up and his train
[35:56] filled the temple
[35:58] about it Steward the seraphims each one
[36:00] had six wings with twine he covered his
[36:03] face and with twine he covered his feet
[36:05] and with trying he did fly
[36:08] in one cry unto another and said holy
[36:11] holy holy is the law of hosts the whole
[36:14] earth is full of his glory Kimberly that
[36:17] verse together
[36:19] verse number three one two three in one
[36:22] cry and to another and say holy holy
[36:26] holy is the Lord hosts the whole here is
[36:30] full of his glory let's do it again just
[36:32] one verse and one two three and one cry
[36:35] and to another and said holy holy holy
[36:39] is the law of host the whole earth is
[36:42] full of his glory amen I'm gonna just
[36:46] pray again
[36:47] Almighty Glory I want to give you thanks
[36:50] I need to ask you Lord to use me
[36:53] you were able to use a donkey to speak
[36:55] to a man to save his life Lord I want to
[36:58] ask you to please use me to speak to
[37:00] your children
[37:01] thank you for everything
[37:03] in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen you
[37:07] can have your seat
[37:09] amen
[37:12] um they're going back there
[37:14] um
[37:15] I was quite shocked when I went this is
[37:17] a well-known scripture but
[37:20] I think it's quite amazing how the Lord
[37:24] inspired Isaiah to to write this because
[37:28] the Lord has many attributes
[37:31] but the one that he really make him show
[37:34] to be there is that he was holy and not
[37:37] only once he was holy holy holy
[37:41] he is a holy king
[37:44] amen amen so I want to talk today about
[37:46] who's influencing you
[37:49] this is um
[37:51] this sermon actually was of course was
[37:53] preached by Brother Branham he is an
[37:55] inspiration day
[37:57] but I'm gonna
[37:58] speak like in a different way I can't
[38:00] speak like that
[38:05] um also for the kids I have like a
[38:08] little bit of trivia
[38:10] I'm gonna give the answer so you're
[38:12] gonna have to answer now and he said how
[38:14] many times did they Israelites March
[38:16] around Jericho before it fell
[38:19] one time seven thirteen or nine times
[38:24] we're gonna do it later seven
[38:27] amen so I want to speak to to the young
[38:31] ones
[38:32] so I'm pretty sure that pretty much
[38:35] everyone that is here well no the
[38:38] parents but they are adolescents in
[38:41] adolescent is a word that means a young
[38:43] person in the process of developing from
[38:46] a child into an adult between 10 and 19
[38:49] years
[38:51] um is where they start experimenting
[38:53] physical cognitive and psychosocial
[38:55] development
[38:57] yeah in that picture you can see the
[38:59] brain of a person
[39:01] with five years old the red you can see
[39:04] the square
[39:06] that's mean their color red means that
[39:08] that's not a material brain he is still
[39:11] developing something there then
[39:14] as uh he's growing you can see the
[39:16] change in the color
[39:18] that means that his brain is maturing in
[39:22] that square it's
[39:24] showing something that's called the
[39:26] executive functions
[39:28] in in that little square you can put all
[39:32] those things together
[39:33] with a impulsive control organization
[39:36] task initiation planning and prodigizing
[39:40] self-monitoring work memory flexible
[39:43] thinking and yeah
[39:45] it goes again so a person that is
[39:49] a young person his brain is not fully
[39:51] developed so he's drawing he's looking
[39:55] what the other people do he can get
[39:57] really influenced yeah because he
[40:00] doesn't have a personality yet
[40:03] and I can say like um when I was young
[40:06] when I was a teenager my mom used to say
[40:08] that uh I was like a dog
[40:10] because if I were not barking I was
[40:12] biting someone I was just horrible
[40:15] I'm really happy that the Lord changed
[40:18] me amen
[40:20] that's how some of the young ones are
[40:23] it's just there's so many hormones going
[40:25] on and they're developing um all those
[40:28] uh functions
[40:30] so just going back to the to the
[40:32] scripture
[40:33] we're going to talk about the king
[40:39] we call him OCS
[40:42] okay so this King actually he was a good
[40:44] King
[40:45] it was very good
[40:47] she was in charge of the Southern
[40:49] Kingdom of Judah you know after the
[40:51] after King Solomon died the kingdom was
[40:53] divided into North and South he was in
[40:56] charge of the South part
[40:58] um while he was in charge he
[41:00] experimented military greatness and
[41:02] victories
[41:03] wealth and his people really love him he
[41:07] was a really good man
[41:08] but um
[41:10] yeah well this King here we have another
[41:12] picture
[41:13] I brought him a picture for the kids and
[41:16] for me too
[41:17] so if you can see the face of the king
[41:19] he's angry
[41:21] in the priests that they are the side
[41:23] they are trying to stop him to do
[41:25] something
[41:26] so um
[41:28] in the story tale that he wanted to
[41:31] offer incense
[41:33] in the temple
[41:34] and when I was reading the thing it's
[41:37] like
[41:39] it wasn't that bad he was trying to do
[41:41] something good you know but
[41:43] that was something that only the priest
[41:45] was ordered by God to do so in his mind
[41:49] he thought man I'm a king I'm doing
[41:52] super good
[41:54] so I'm something something more I can do
[41:58] something
[42:00] that I'm not allowed to do so he really
[42:02] thought that he was something amen
[42:05] so after
[42:07] a couple of minutes there when the
[42:09] priest they told him to please stop he
[42:11] got angry and the lord gave him a mark
[42:14] in the in his forehead was a leprosy
[42:18] I I really think that
[42:22] the lord gave him leprosy in his
[42:24] forehead was because he had really bad
[42:26] thought and we know that the leprosy
[42:28] means sin right
[42:30] so there was something wrong in his mind
[42:32] so the Lord marked him and after that
[42:36] of course if you have leprosy back in
[42:38] those days you will Cast Away you you
[42:40] will not will receive anymore you were
[42:43] unclean you were
[42:44] you were filthy
[42:46] so this King
[42:48] he died and his people love him so when
[42:51] he died there was like um
[42:54] morning
[42:56] we were mourning upon the people
[42:58] everyone was there even Isaiah
[43:01] so we're going to go here
[43:04] so I was trying to research about the
[43:07] like the connection that Isaiah and
[43:12] no use
[43:14] I'm gonna call him his names in Spanish
[43:21] so
[43:23] in some places you can find that they
[43:26] were
[43:27] usia was his ankle
[43:30] in other places that you can find that
[43:32] they were framed but
[43:33] sure thing that they were really they
[43:36] were friends
[43:38] in some places you can find that they
[43:39] used to go to the temple to pray so this
[43:42] the Isaiah was younger than him so of
[43:46] course he was looking up to that man he
[43:48] was a good man
[43:50] so when he died all the people were said
[43:54] and Isaiah
[43:57] he
[43:58] was a prophet of God
[44:01] but
[44:02] that was not all
[44:04] there was something more
[44:06] I think the
[44:08] because he was influenced by that King
[44:10] the Lord couldn't totally use him
[44:13] so when that King died
[44:15] he saw a mighty vision of the Lord
[44:17] that's the scripture that we just read
[44:20] he wrote in the entire Bible if you see
[44:22] if you read the book of Isaiah it's then
[44:25] time over there from beginning to the
[44:27] end
[44:28] to the millennial Kingdom so there was
[44:30] heaps more in store for him
[44:35] so
[44:37] want to do another question here's who
[44:39] do you admire
[44:41] to the young ones
[44:42] do you have my like the music stars the
[44:45] Hollywood stars famous people rich
[44:47] people talented people
[44:49] if you admire those people I can totally
[44:53] say that their influences
[44:55] the influences of the devil because you
[44:59] can see by the work that they do
[45:02] here in Galatians we can find here said
[45:05] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[45:07] which are these adultery fornication
[45:10] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[45:14] witchcraft hatred variance emulation
[45:16] rough strife seditions heresies and
[45:19] Vines made this drunkenness revealing
[45:21] and such like of the which I tell you
[45:23] before as I have also told you in the
[45:27] time past that they which those such
[45:31] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[45:32] God
[45:33] if you see all these influences or all
[45:36] the famous people in the world
[45:39] these are the works that they do
[45:41] they marry and they remarried and then
[45:44] have the God with someone else and one
[45:47] day they are men one day their woman
[45:49] next day they can be a giraffe or
[45:51] something they can
[45:53] they just change the mind all the time
[45:57] in
[45:59] when I was young I used to because I
[46:02] play guitar I used to admire
[46:05] people from the world that they play the
[46:07] guitar
[46:08] and that really dragged me into what I
[46:11] ended up doing like drugs and whatever
[46:12] everything what I did but I didn't
[46:14] notice because it's so something so
[46:17] subtle isn't you
[46:19] um oh you're gonna listen
[46:21] it's just something you don't realize
[46:24] what are you doing and I was looking at
[46:27] a picture of of me like in 2017 or 19 no
[46:30] less when I was like
[46:33] 20 years
[46:34] leather jacket long hair drinking
[46:37] alcohol
[46:38] that was that was what I was looking you
[46:41] know that kind of people was it oh man
[46:43] these guys are awesome I want to be like
[46:45] them
[46:46] I was totally wrong and then when I Was
[46:50] preparing this
[46:52] I started thinking what well who's
[46:54] influencing me and there's
[46:58] the brothers and sisters over there here
[47:01] they're really good
[47:03] you can see the fruits of the spirit in
[47:05] them
[47:06] in the fruits of the experience they
[47:07] have love joy peace long suffering
[47:11] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[47:14] Temperance against such
[47:16] there's no law
[47:19] and
[47:20] I was thinking I really admire Ben
[47:24] I can see all those frozen him but then
[47:27] something spoke to my hand said
[47:29] you are doing exactly what I saw you're
[47:31] doing you're looking the mean but all
[47:33] those fruits are not from Bean
[47:36] those Frozen from the Lord
[47:38] and everyone that you can see the fruit
[47:42] s Lord so young people if you can look
[47:45] up to someone just remember
[47:48] that you have to look up to the Lord not
[47:50] a man amen and
[47:53] um
[47:54] that's something really powerful because
[47:56] if you base
[47:57] you walk with the Lord in a human he he
[48:00] can fail
[48:01] but the Lord's Never Gonna fail amen
[48:08] she just took Iran
[48:11] so how many times
[48:13] okay okay wait one time someone said one
[48:16] time
[48:17] no one seven times
[48:21] heaps of time 13 times
[48:26] eight nine times
[48:27] no one okay
[48:29] well the correct answer it's 13 times
[48:32] he said according to Joshua the walls of
[48:35] Jericho fell after the Israelite March
[48:37] around the city walls once a day for six
[48:40] days and seven times of the seventh day
[48:42] and then you blow their horns
[48:46] so it was 13 times
[48:49] amen
[48:53] it was only a few there at the back that
[48:55] they need the answer
[48:57] amen
[48:58] so what I wanted to talk today was about
[49:01] having a an experience with the Lord
[49:04] an experience with the Lord is something
[49:06] that's going to change you like forever
[49:09] yeah what was night became day and you
[49:12] just change
[49:13] I have sorry I have experience with the
[49:16] Lord and it's not because of
[49:18] I'm a great person he gave me an
[49:21] experience with him that's why I feel so
[49:24] blessed it meant an experience with the
[49:27] lord it's something that no one can take
[49:29] it away
[49:30] even if if you look up on a man and if
[49:33] he fails
[49:34] that's nothing I'm looking the Lord
[49:36] because I met him and that's something
[49:39] that's the best thing that you can have
[49:42] um so I have a quote here saying
[49:45] that's what the Devils try to do all the
[49:47] time burn you up on something make you
[49:50] sicker when you prayed for make you
[49:53] think you you have lost your experience
[49:55] with God he's lying to you the time
[49:58] comes when you have to stand on God's
[50:00] word stand alone but when the time comes
[50:03] stand there there's got to be a time
[50:05] when you have got to separate yourself
[50:07] between your feelings and your faith
[50:09] that's the time it's tonight
[50:12] it's today for the young people um I
[50:15] really want to encourage you to pray and
[50:18] to have an experience with the Lord
[50:21] so this is something that I've found on
[50:24] the internet said um your friends
[50:25] influence you choose them wisely
[50:28] your friends
[50:29] the friends you have in your life can
[50:32] impact what you ended up achieving in
[50:34] your life if you have specific career
[50:37] aspiration or a desire to inscript
[50:40] increase your education it's invaluable
[50:42] to ensure they support who you are and
[50:45] what is important to you
[50:47] they don't necessarily need to be on the
[50:50] same life path or hold their same dreams
[50:53] but they need to be a positive support
[50:55] system and bring value to their
[50:57] relationship considering the way you
[51:00] think feel and behave is significantly
[51:02] influenced by your friends it's
[51:05] imperative we choose our friends wisely
[51:08] they are you people and are you most
[51:11] vital assist that's why I really think
[51:14] I really love that song what a friend we
[51:16] find in Jesus
[51:18] if he's your friend
[51:20] you're gonna get all those nice fruits
[51:22] of the spirit you are you're gonna be a
[51:25] good prison I think what's brother being
[51:27] what he was preaching he was saying if
[51:29] you can make the lower thoughts your
[51:30] thoughts
[51:32] man your life it can be so much better
[51:35] if you can do the thing and if you can
[51:37] really
[51:38] ask the lawful experience with him your
[51:41] life can change it can be so much better
[51:42] you don't have to go through all the
[51:44] rubbish of the world you can just do it
[51:47] now yeah
[51:48] yeah amen
[51:50] um
[51:52] have another scripture here I was
[51:54] listening a sermon on Friday
[51:57] while I was working and
[52:00] the Potter he started reading this man
[52:02] there was something in me I was like
[52:04] because I can jump now in the in the
[52:06] parents group because I have a little
[52:08] small daughter
[52:11] and says Deuteronomy 6 said and he's
[52:15] talking about um his Moses after his uh
[52:18] give the Ten Commandments and these
[52:20] words which I command thee these days
[52:22] shall be in thine heart and thou shalt
[52:25] teach them diligently unto thy children
[52:28] and shall talk to them when thou cities
[52:30] in thine house and when thou walketh by
[52:33] the way and where thou lies down and
[52:35] when thou rise it up and thou shalt bind
[52:38] them for a sighing upon their in hand
[52:40] and they shall be as a front
[52:42] front list between thine eyes and thou
[52:45] shalt write them upon the pose of thy
[52:47] house and on the gates
[52:51] when I was reading when I was listening
[52:53] this man but how do you call that when
[52:56] you have like something like Goosebumps
[52:59] yeah because it's really up to us the
[53:01] parents
[53:03] to pray for our children to really
[53:07] teach them the word
[53:09] and um
[53:11] I really know that
[53:12] you know had the way that the devil
[53:14] attacked
[53:16] he's going to try to give the the father
[53:19] because he's the head of the the family
[53:21] and if he cannot he go for the wife
[53:24] and
[53:25] I saw that in in my parents life
[53:28] he was getting my father okay now my
[53:31] mother sickness you know
[53:34] um
[53:36] depressed that the president because she
[53:39] was alone in the house
[53:40] so all those thoughts all the thoughts
[53:43] if he cannot get the father he's gonna
[53:45] go for the wife and then he's gonna go
[53:47] for the children
[53:49] because
[53:50] as a Naomi was reading
[53:52] the devil is acting like a lion he wants
[53:56] to be alive he's not a lion but he act
[53:59] like a lion and if you see how the lion
[54:01] attack
[54:02] they see like a hear it of animals and
[54:05] they look for the young ones for the old
[54:08] ones and for the sick ones
[54:10] they went there they say Target for him
[54:12] yeah
[54:13] yeah so yeah
[54:14] it's really up to you children to have
[54:17] like a experience with the Lord you can
[54:19] pray if you don't have an experience
[54:21] with the Lord
[54:23] we should pray for that because
[54:25] if the family is all together
[54:28] man the family is an invincible family
[54:32] so just wanted to finish with the
[54:35] question who is influencing you
[54:37] are you gonna keep being influenced by
[54:39] the world
[54:40] or for God
[54:42] there's many many ways to get Influence
[54:45] of Music the things that they watch it's
[54:48] sports or whatever you know all this uh
[54:50] team plays that they are good man I want
[54:53] to be like that guys of
[54:55] your life is just going down downhill
[54:59] so this is everything what I have it was
[55:02] my thought so if if we can stand we can
[55:04] pray if the children if if you want to
[55:07] rise up with your hands because you
[55:09] don't have an experience with the Lord
[55:10] we can pray so let's just stand
[55:15] and pray to the god
[55:18] just leave your hand if you don't have
[55:19] an experience with the Lord
[55:21] because he can give you one
[55:25] almighty God
[55:26] we give you things
[55:28] because you are awesome Lord
[55:31] we want to give you things because you
[55:33] take care for us
[55:35] you're an awesome God lord there are
[55:37] many hands
[55:39] your children's Lord that they want to
[55:40] experience with you we need an
[55:43] experience with you Lord that can change
[55:44] our lives
[55:47] we need a burning bush experience Lord
[55:49] we need a road to Damascus experience
[55:52] Lord
[55:53] we want to ask you Lord to please give
[55:55] experience with you to all these
[55:56] children Lord
[55:58] be with us Lord
[55:59] thank you for all your blessing father
[56:02] in Jesus Christ's name I prayed amen

[1:01:16] I I was looking at a picture like that I
[1:01:18] thought no I'm not going to put that in
[1:01:19] I guess well because someone else put it
[1:01:21] in for me but praise the Lord so I want
[1:01:24] to take part two of who's influencing
[1:01:25] you
[1:01:26] and um yeah so God bless you let's just
[1:01:29] read um Second Timothy 1 7.
[1:01:32] um
[1:01:33] I also like to give brother Ben a
[1:01:34] bouquet
[1:01:36] you know this man has real faith
[1:01:39] last uh Tuesday when I think Mario's at
[1:01:42] her lowest he said he committed her and
[1:01:45] the baby to the Lord and brothers it's
[1:01:47] the most powerful thing one of the most
[1:01:49] powerful weapons is a full committal to
[1:01:50] God
[1:01:51] it's Faith bro you're an inspiration to
[1:01:53] me
[1:01:54] so God bless you
[1:01:56] okay really it's yep it's because
[1:01:58] remember when pressure comes on
[1:02:00] something's going to come out
[1:02:02] faith comes out praise the Lord amen to
[1:02:05] God bless you amen
[1:02:07] I mean first second Timothy one and
[1:02:09] seven for God has not given us the
[1:02:12] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:02:14] and of a sound mind I mean let's just
[1:02:17] bow he's in a word of prayer gracious
[1:02:19] father we're so thankful Lord we can bow
[1:02:21] our heads in your presence once again we
[1:02:23] thank you Lord we can uh thank you for
[1:02:26] that soul-searching message we just
[1:02:27] heard Lord about who's influencing us
[1:02:29] Lord I pray father that all of us Lord
[1:02:33] just be you o God may you grant it Lord
[1:02:35] bless brother Jimmy for that we
[1:02:37] appreciated it so much Lord and fathers
[1:02:39] we just opened your word once again I
[1:02:40] pray you'll just take it once again Lord
[1:02:42] anointed to our hearts For Your Glory we
[1:02:44] love you so much and we thank you in
[1:02:46] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[1:02:49] you may have your seat so
[1:02:51] um
[1:02:52] so yes I want to take a part two from
[1:02:54] what brother Jimmy was saying is is
[1:02:56] who's influencing you and I want to talk
[1:02:59] about the effect of influence talking
[1:03:00] about in the body
[1:03:02] so um as we've got here um uh the the
[1:03:06] word A sound mind is actually one word
[1:03:08] in Greek and it's an admonishing
[1:03:10] according to soundness of mind to
[1:03:12] moderation and self-control so that's
[1:03:13] what it means from the Thea Bible
[1:03:15] dictionary now what happens is when
[1:03:17] things affect us in our spirit it
[1:03:18] affects our body okay so brother Brown
[1:03:21] brings out a couple of uh you just go
[1:03:22] through the prayer line You'll see these
[1:03:24] here many times but I just want to bring
[1:03:25] two out and all of you that have heart
[1:03:28] trouble stand to your feet just a moment
[1:03:29] every person with heart trouble there's
[1:03:31] too many to call you just can't catch
[1:03:33] them stand here for a moment sister come
[1:03:34] our sister suffers with the stomach
[1:03:36] trouble caused from nervousness so she
[1:03:39] had a physical problem because of a
[1:03:41] spiritual problem
[1:03:42] and and and you'll see this at many
[1:03:45] times that's that that the devil will
[1:03:47] attack our spirit and will begin to
[1:03:49] affect our body it'll manifest
[1:03:51] physically so things that are spiritual
[1:03:53] manifest physically
[1:03:55] and he says here now yes you're
[1:03:57] suffering with a high blood pressure
[1:03:58] that's right caused from a nervous
[1:04:00] condition
[1:04:01] so there's there's trouble in the world
[1:04:03] today and it and it and it's your
[1:04:06] nervousness we know we live in a very
[1:04:07] nervous age we live in a very fast pace
[1:04:09] age very complex neurotic age and but we
[1:04:13] see that you know uh spiritual things
[1:04:15] manifest physically so notice he didn't
[1:04:18] say you just have high blood pressure
[1:04:20] because of high cholesterol or whatever
[1:04:22] it is no it's from a nervous condition
[1:04:23] so we need to look at what I want to
[1:04:25] look at actually is the effect of
[1:04:29] um the internet on our lives now
[1:04:31] remember every this is a tool there's
[1:04:35] nothing wrong with this
[1:04:37] there's nothing wrong with this there's
[1:04:39] nothing wrong with that
[1:04:40] it's how you use it right
[1:04:43] so
[1:04:44] so there's nothing wrong with these
[1:04:46] things but but how do we use them and
[1:04:48] how do they affect us this is what we
[1:04:50] want to go into because this is very
[1:04:52] important and this actually covers every
[1:04:53] age
[1:04:54] so not just young people but but old
[1:04:56] people and and in between people those
[1:04:59] young at heart people and so
[1:05:02] um I'm sorry I just have this here so so
[1:05:05] so here's a take-home thought let
[1:05:07] technology be a tool for you don't be a
[1:05:09] tool of Technology because we live in a
[1:05:12] consumer age right and and what happens
[1:05:15] is that that you know anything that is
[1:05:18] popular today there's a science behind
[1:05:20] it why it's popular it's not popular
[1:05:22] because of a stab in the dark wow how
[1:05:24] did this thing go organically grow you
[1:05:26] know even even you look at McDonald's
[1:05:28] and like the the the discomfort of the
[1:05:32] seat the color of the room everything in
[1:05:34] that everything in the restaurant not
[1:05:36] even so we're not even talking about the
[1:05:38] food yet is engineered because they want
[1:05:41] to turn people over at a certain rate to
[1:05:43] earn a certain amount of money okay and
[1:05:45] then of course with the food they've
[1:05:47] engineered that to be very addictive to
[1:05:49] all ages
[1:05:51] because imagine if McDonald's was
[1:05:54] um organic free range Whole Food you
[1:05:57] think your kids would be I want to go to
[1:05:59] McDonald's
[1:06:00] no that that Chain's gone you know why
[1:06:05] because it's not addictive
[1:06:06] it's good for you I mean if it was that
[1:06:08] way it'd be good for you but you see
[1:06:10] what happens is is is very powerful uh
[1:06:14] very very popular things are addictive
[1:06:17] and there's been a manipulation of the
[1:06:18] human mind and body for it to be
[1:06:21] addictive
[1:06:22] so this is what we're going to go into
[1:06:23] now
[1:06:25] um
[1:06:26] who knows
[1:06:28] we're gonna have a science lesson today
[1:06:31] some people oh man Sunday afternoon
[1:06:33] anyway who knows what this chemical is
[1:06:36] does anyone know what this chemical is
[1:06:38] anyone doing anyone want to guess
[1:06:42] uh yes Malachi
[1:06:44] no it's not water but it floats in water
[1:06:49] we're 70 opposite water do you know
[1:06:50] you're a bag of water walking around
[1:06:52] with a life and anyway this is called
[1:06:55] dopamine so we're going to talk about
[1:06:56] brain chemistry today so dopamine is a
[1:06:59] pleasure chemical that is released in
[1:07:01] your brain now what happens is is
[1:07:04] especially I'm going to talk about the
[1:07:05] internet in specific but isn't anything
[1:07:07] when you eat McDonald's it produces
[1:07:09] dopamine your body is being told I like
[1:07:12] this a lot
[1:07:13] that's why you go back for more and if
[1:07:15] you could again you know this is why you
[1:07:18] beat you if you could you'd be through
[1:07:19] the drive through every day because your
[1:07:21] brain is producing dopamine and this is
[1:07:24] in everything you enjoy even if you love
[1:07:26] the presence of the Lord which I pray
[1:07:27] you all do your body will be producing
[1:07:29] dopamine in the brain I like this this
[1:07:31] is good this is awesome on the amen it's
[1:07:33] because it's a pleasure chemical right
[1:07:35] but you see Silicon Valley which I'm
[1:07:38] just encompassing all social media in
[1:07:39] the internet I'm just all of them are
[1:07:40] just a one big lump they've exploited
[1:07:43] this chemical
[1:07:44] Coca-Cola any any popular brand known to
[1:07:48] man has exploited this chemical
[1:07:51] this is from this is from a newspaper
[1:07:54] called The Guardian this from 2018 an
[1:07:56] article says Silicon Valley is Keen to
[1:07:58] exploit the brain chemical creative with
[1:08:00] keeping us tapping on apps and social
[1:08:02] media
[1:08:03] in an unprecedented attack of of Candor
[1:08:06] which is honesty
[1:08:07] Sean Parker the 38 year old founding
[1:08:10] president of Facebook recently admitted
[1:08:11] that the social network was founded not
[1:08:13] to unite us but to distract us
[1:08:17] the thought now I read this I'm thinking
[1:08:20] I'm still on Facebook am I going to get
[1:08:22] off Facebook because of this probably
[1:08:23] not
[1:08:24] because it's a tool
[1:08:26] it's very easy just to scroll all day
[1:08:28] I'm throwing myself in this too I've
[1:08:30] realized after this man I'm on my phone
[1:08:32] way too much
[1:08:34] see not to unite us but to distract us
[1:08:36] the thought process was how can we
[1:08:38] consume as much of your time and
[1:08:40] conscious attention as possible
[1:08:43] that's the thrust
[1:08:46] he said in an event in Philadelphia in
[1:08:48] November to achieve this goal Facebook's
[1:08:50] architect exploited a vulnerability in
[1:08:52] human psychology explained Parker who
[1:08:54] resigned from the company in 2005
[1:08:56] whenever someone likes or comments on a
[1:08:59] post or photograph he said we give you a
[1:09:02] little dopamine hit
[1:09:04] so produces that you get a like you see
[1:09:07] a photo you see a video you like it's
[1:09:09] producing dopamine in your brain
[1:09:12] so we've built a little we give you a
[1:09:15] little dopamine hit Facebook as an
[1:09:16] Empire of Empires then built upon a
[1:09:19] molecule
[1:09:21] so it is popular because it exploits
[1:09:23] this
[1:09:24] see
[1:09:26] the devil knows our bodies too
[1:09:29] he knows how to exploit human
[1:09:31] vulnerabilities against us now as I said
[1:09:33] does that mean I'm going to get off
[1:09:35] Facebook no I'm going to stay on
[1:09:36] Facebook
[1:09:37] but is it something where I just
[1:09:39] actually just get my daily fix
[1:09:41] or is it at all see don't let don't be
[1:09:45] let let the in let technology be your
[1:09:48] tool don't be a tool for it okay because
[1:09:51] they want to keep your attention because
[1:09:53] they make money off of you and your data
[1:09:56] now this is now you just think about
[1:09:57] this this I just Googled this top 21
[1:09:59] social networking sites 2023 and this is
[1:10:02] your the first few so an Mau because I'm
[1:10:05] like what's an Mau it's a monthly active
[1:10:08] user so this is a number of active users
[1:10:10] on these platforms okay so Facebook has
[1:10:13] 296 billion ma use
[1:10:16] that is so the world population is about
[1:10:19] 8 billion people that's a lot of people
[1:10:21] on One platform that's a lot of people
[1:10:24] scrolling that's a lot of people liking
[1:10:26] a lot of people commenting a lot of
[1:10:28] people posting that's a lot of people a
[1:10:29] month they
[1:10:30] YouTubers 2.2 billion
[1:10:33] WhatsApp two billion Instagram two
[1:10:35] WeChat 1.26 billion Tick Tock is one
[1:10:39] billion and
[1:10:40] um the other one is 573 million
[1:10:44] that's a lot of people a
[1:10:46] but the reason that people are on it is
[1:10:49] because it's addictive
[1:10:52] see what
[1:10:54] what's influencing you as we heard now
[1:10:56] how's it influencing you because all
[1:10:58] this changes your brain chemistry
[1:11:01] it's not just a thing that doesn't it's
[1:11:03] like you eat a Big Mac the first one may
[1:11:05] be good the next one just carrying
[1:11:07] around with you for a bit longer and
[1:11:09] then you get older you carry it for
[1:11:10] longer
[1:11:12] right it goes here and for me it goes
[1:11:14] here
[1:11:14] okay so if you take that just your body
[1:11:17] like that then how much more your brain
[1:11:20] because what happens is technology
[1:11:22] rewires our brains especially in
[1:11:24] adolescence as we as brother Jimmy
[1:11:26] showed the development right of the
[1:11:27] brain
[1:11:29] so now what this causes
[1:11:32] is a
[1:11:34] so this exploits also so especially in
[1:11:37] young people this this exploits
[1:11:41] chemistry in the brain now what happens
[1:11:43] is you know our brain as we saw it's not
[1:11:45] fully developed when we're when we're a
[1:11:47] baby
[1:11:48] right it's when you're about 20 you're
[1:11:50] you're you're there maybe for me 26. I
[1:11:54] get there eventually but what happens is
[1:11:56] the more dopamine you produce
[1:12:00] they actually so so
[1:12:02] you can produce a lot of it but then
[1:12:04] actually the body begins to produce less
[1:12:05] of it so something is very addictive you
[1:12:08] really begin to enjoy it but then you
[1:12:10] need a greater hit of it to produce that
[1:12:12] same feeling in your body so this
[1:12:14] produces a real lethargic person
[1:12:18] and so you've got to keep that in mind
[1:12:19] when we talk about these things because
[1:12:20] what happens especially in a young brain
[1:12:22] is it begins to rewire your brain now
[1:12:25] we're gonna I'm gonna show you a video
[1:12:26] soon I hope you don't fall asleep in it
[1:12:28] because it's a science video but I'm
[1:12:30] just going to show you these things
[1:12:31] first okay so now I don't know if you
[1:12:34] can see this but this is a this is a
[1:12:36] um a diagram of a connection between two
[1:12:40] uh basically two neurons in in a brain
[1:12:43] has you ever seen a picture I was going
[1:12:45] to show you a literal picture of a brain
[1:12:47] but I thought no I won't show you that
[1:12:48] you know someone's brain anyway so what
[1:12:52] happens is it's actually a transfer of
[1:12:54] chemicals causes transmission between
[1:12:56] your brain now dopamine you see here
[1:13:00] you see these here so neurotrasmatic
[1:13:03] molecules one of them is dopamine
[1:13:05] so your body will produce a lot of it
[1:13:07] when it's enjoying something and then it
[1:13:09] will produce and then it will send a
[1:13:10] chemical signal and then you'll feel
[1:13:12] happy or whatever more but then the more
[1:13:14] you have that head of that thing your
[1:13:16] body will produce less and what actually
[1:13:18] that causes is a lack of a a lack of
[1:13:21] empathy in that person
[1:13:23] so the more technology the more
[1:13:24] addiction we have the greater the drop
[1:13:27] of empathy between one another
[1:13:30] now when you're when your brain is first
[1:13:33] um so so there's all these connections
[1:13:35] like this now your brain actually
[1:13:37] rewires itself when you go through
[1:13:39] adolescence
[1:13:40] so this is now us now this is a diagram
[1:13:43] I don't know if you can see it very well
[1:13:44] but your brain is full of synapses which
[1:13:46] are these connections that we just saw
[1:13:48] like this right
[1:13:49] and your so
[1:13:51] so from 36 weeks so this is I don't know
[1:13:54] how they've got these pictures
[1:13:55] but this is a braid at 36 weeks not many
[1:13:58] connections right
[1:13:59] and in a newborns like this and then you
[1:14:02] see as you go along there's heaps more
[1:14:04] connections made
[1:14:05] but then notice now
[1:14:07] from four to six years is actually a
[1:14:10] decrease
[1:14:11] so it actually comes a point where you
[1:14:13] have all these connections and then what
[1:14:15] happens is in your body just you know
[1:14:17] around this time and then and then as
[1:14:19] you go along there's a lot of these um
[1:14:22] synapses here actually get cut away
[1:14:24] there's and it's called you either use
[1:14:26] it or you lose it so your brain builds
[1:14:28] all these pathways and then the ones you
[1:14:31] use the brain says we need this we're
[1:14:32] going to keep it we don't use that one
[1:14:34] we're going to get rid of it
[1:14:36] so if you're addicted to a certain thing
[1:14:38] like your hit is is technology or
[1:14:41] whatever then your brain will keep that
[1:14:44] connection
[1:14:45] and the other ones you don't use it'll
[1:14:46] be cut away and and this happens at a
[1:14:49] great rate after six years old and it
[1:14:51] begins to Plateau then but then slowly
[1:14:52] as you age you lose these synapses
[1:14:56] slowly
[1:14:57] but then it's amazing because between
[1:14:59] the ages of 10 to 13 is there's a big
[1:15:02] drop of this other chemical which
[1:15:04] actually takes away all the chicken
[1:15:06] balance in your brain so before you hit
[1:15:09] puberty there's a balance of chicken
[1:15:10] balancing a child's brain is this a good
[1:15:13] I want to do this is this a good idea no
[1:15:16] okay but then when you get to older into
[1:15:19] puberty the the check or the balance
[1:15:22] goes real small so the I'm going to do
[1:15:24] this crazy thing
[1:15:26] and before and I was like yeah that's
[1:15:27] crazy let's not do it but now it's I'm
[1:15:29] going to do this thing and this little
[1:15:31] voice says that's crazy
[1:15:32] well I can't hear you that's a crazy
[1:15:34] thing who's had kids that you know you
[1:15:36] think man they're just playing something
[1:15:38] that's like whoa what are they doing
[1:15:39] it's because their brain is developing
[1:15:41] nothing wrong with the child it's just
[1:15:42] their brain is developing you see so but
[1:15:45] then what happens around that time
[1:15:46] around 10 years old many many parents
[1:15:49] think well my child's 10 I can trust
[1:15:52] them so they pass them a smartphone
[1:15:54] then it opens a whole Gateway
[1:15:57] to a world of Crazy Town
[1:15:59] because if you look at any if you look
[1:16:01] at any
[1:16:02] search and I don't recommend it you'll
[1:16:05] start with something wholesome you'll
[1:16:06] end up in crazy
[1:16:08] because the devil wants you to go to
[1:16:10] crazy
[1:16:11] but the thing is people should be
[1:16:13] naturally be curious
[1:16:19] you should want to know what is the
[1:16:20] world what what's you know what's going
[1:16:21] on what you know what's happening to me
[1:16:23] all these things it's natural to have a
[1:16:25] curiosity
[1:16:26] but then it's up to us as parents to
[1:16:28] guide that Curiosity
[1:16:30] okay
[1:16:32] so now this causes so so this is synapse
[1:16:36] pruning okay now I've talked about that
[1:16:38] so you've got to be careful how your
[1:16:40] brain now your brain can get rewired
[1:16:42] right but you've got to be we must be
[1:16:45] careful that we don't just get addicted
[1:16:47] to anything and our brain's only wired
[1:16:50] that way
[1:16:51] just like I was saying about how the
[1:16:52] people have high blood pressure because
[1:16:54] the nervousness is anything else because
[1:16:55] you know so a spirit got you know
[1:16:57] something affected their spirit and
[1:16:58] their wired their body a certain way
[1:17:01] high blood pressure different things see
[1:17:03] so that so is manifesting what was
[1:17:05] spiritually going on and it's the same
[1:17:07] thing when we when we're on anything
[1:17:09] right spiritually it will affect us but
[1:17:12] then physically it will affect it'll be
[1:17:14] manifested who's with me so far right
[1:17:17] this is probably all of the biology you
[1:17:20] ever want in your life but you know
[1:17:23] so there's a physiology physiological
[1:17:26] effect from these things
[1:17:29] now
[1:17:30] dopamine I'm just going to go this demo
[1:17:33] that I may be put on the video now does
[1:17:35] dopamine affect empathy this is what
[1:17:38] this is what we were told now
[1:17:41] does so how dopamine drives human
[1:17:44] behavior healthy levels of dopamine can
[1:17:47] also make us more social and extroverted
[1:17:49] this feel-good
[1:17:51] neurotransmitter also helps increase our
[1:17:53] empathy for others make us more willing
[1:17:55] to adapt to others needs dopamine can
[1:17:58] also stimulate creativity
[1:18:00] so if you have if you have a low level
[1:18:02] of dopamine because of addiction you are
[1:18:04] less empathetic
[1:18:05] less yeah you have less empathy you're
[1:18:08] less creative and you're more
[1:18:10] introverted
[1:18:12] now I haven't put this up but everyone
[1:18:15] should I mean this is extreme cases but
[1:18:18] and I know I've said it before but
[1:18:20] there's a whole group of young men in
[1:18:22] Japan called the hikomori over a hundred
[1:18:25] thousand of them
[1:18:26] that live in their rooms and their
[1:18:28] parents place they never go out they're
[1:18:29] addicted to online world
[1:18:31] it's a it's a it's an epidemic or a
[1:18:34] pandemic or whatever it is bad
[1:18:36] in that country
[1:18:37] because these these young men that
[1:18:40] should be living to their full potential
[1:18:41] and I think it's even women too but
[1:18:43] they're locked in this little world
[1:18:45] and they don't know how to get out of it
[1:18:48] and because they've been because they've
[1:18:50] trained their bodies unfortunately to
[1:18:53] live off the stuff
[1:18:55] but you see
[1:18:57] that may be an extreme case but we don't
[1:18:59] ever want to
[1:19:01] we don't ever want to get caught up in
[1:19:03] an addiction that makes us anti-social
[1:19:05] you know the reason people uh I've heard
[1:19:07] there's been studies done that addiction
[1:19:09] happens because of a lack of connection
[1:19:12] that's actually the major cause of
[1:19:13] addiction a lack of connection to other
[1:19:15] people
[1:19:17] what is technology addiction
[1:19:19] Google tells me technology addiction
[1:19:22] also called internet addiction or
[1:19:23] internet use disorder among other names
[1:19:25] is a broad term used to describe any
[1:19:27] obsessive Tech related behavior that can
[1:19:30] be gaming online shopping social media
[1:19:32] use video watching or any anything else
[1:19:35] involving digital technology
[1:19:38] now all of those things
[1:19:41] can be good
[1:19:43] gaming can help reflexes I'm not
[1:19:45] advocating gaming but you know there's
[1:19:46] all good online shopping all the
[1:19:47] scissors you say praise God
[1:19:50] it's a good thing you know social media
[1:19:53] use you can talk and video whatever
[1:19:55] you're video watching YouTube you know
[1:19:57] all you know there's good things right
[1:19:58] but when it becomes an addiction
[1:20:01] that is the problem
[1:20:03] right and in the causes so addiction to
[1:20:06] screens generally develops when the
[1:20:08] subject seeks to divert its attention
[1:20:10] from discomfort
[1:20:11] so it's looking for a place of safety
[1:20:15] amen it can't find Comfort oh well Mom
[1:20:18] doesn't understand me dad doesn't
[1:20:19] understand me I don't understand me this
[1:20:22] person doesn't so I need to find I need
[1:20:23] a safe place
[1:20:25] well the Lord is our place that we can
[1:20:28] find Comfort we can find rest we can be
[1:20:30] ourselves in his presence amen see to
[1:20:33] divert its attention from discomfort
[1:20:35] boredom sleep sleeplessness lack of
[1:20:37] purpose or even social isolation can be
[1:20:40] triggers
[1:20:41] boredom's a good thing
[1:20:45] it actually should stimulate creativity
[1:20:49] oh yes I'm getting a head shake right
[1:20:52] there
[1:20:53] boredom is a good thing
[1:20:56] how many no okay we went to a talk at
[1:20:59] school where they talked about these
[1:21:00] things but you know how many of us
[1:21:01] endured boring road trips as kids
[1:21:06] are you alive
[1:21:09] did you survive it
[1:21:12] well you know it's good to be bored some
[1:21:16] of the greatest discoveries in the world
[1:21:17] known to man is because of boredom
[1:21:19] people are going to think and experiment
[1:21:21] do things play things you know how do
[1:21:23] you think a lot of games were invented
[1:21:25] get outside and play well what are we
[1:21:27] going to do well there's a ball okay
[1:21:29] next minute we have an international
[1:21:32] game
[1:21:34] they all started somewhere you know FIFA
[1:21:37] didn't turn up and say Let There Be
[1:21:38] soccer and now there's soccer no it
[1:21:40] evolved it evolved from something it
[1:21:42] evolved away from kids being bored
[1:21:44] kicking around a I don't know something
[1:21:47] how did rugby start you know
[1:21:50] all these things
[1:21:52] nothing wrong with the game
[1:21:54] don't let it be your God but you know
[1:21:56] what I mean boredom is actually you know
[1:21:58] Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree
[1:22:00] and threw an apple fall
[1:22:02] then he wrote the laws of motion because
[1:22:03] he was a genius
[1:22:05] gravitational Laws of Motion but things
[1:22:07] you're sitting under a tree watching an
[1:22:08] Apple for
[1:22:10] yeah you know
[1:22:11] he began to understand the world because
[1:22:13] he saw an apple fall what is oh he's
[1:22:16] probably bought at the time just sitting
[1:22:18] there lovely you know then this thud
[1:22:20] then it sparked something in his life
[1:22:22] how much more you and I meditate on the
[1:22:25] word maybe I was having a boring day you
[1:22:27] think on a scripture a song comes to
[1:22:28] mind boom in the whole world of God just
[1:22:31] opens up and everything
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:35] now who we are online should be the same
[1:22:38] as we are in real life
[1:22:40] we don't have an online Persona and a
[1:22:42] real life Persona we should have the
[1:22:43] same thing
[1:22:45] amen we shouldn't be different kind of
[1:22:47] people
[1:22:47] you know
[1:22:49] there's a lot of things I think we need
[1:22:51] as families because because every family
[1:22:52] is Sovereign but you need to have a
[1:22:54] discussion you should have a government
[1:22:56] policy
[1:22:57] on device use
[1:23:00] you should because you know children
[1:23:02] children in Intermediate School
[1:23:05] they share newts
[1:23:07] boys collect them like Pokemon cards
[1:23:10] and of course that Lee and there's a lot
[1:23:11] of pressure on girls to share notes
[1:23:15] Intermediate School
[1:23:17] there's a lot of pressure on that
[1:23:19] that also leads to Blackmail
[1:23:22] then they share more
[1:23:24] then they're trapped
[1:23:26] we shouldn't be trapped by anything
[1:23:28] even if you've done those things you'll
[1:23:30] be able to talk to your parents
[1:23:32] because they can have even just a
[1:23:33] confession exposure will actually unlock
[1:23:35] you from that thing
[1:23:37] you know at least a black male boys
[1:23:39] trade them
[1:23:41] um you know like Snapchat what is
[1:23:43] Snapchat I mean to me Tick Tock is Crazy
[1:23:45] Town
[1:23:47] you've got to be careful what you're
[1:23:48] looking at you have to know before the
[1:23:50] Lord well that's a cool video but then
[1:23:52] what about the one after that you can't
[1:23:54] unsee that's on there even YouTube can
[1:23:56] be crazy town
[1:23:57] Google image search crazy a town you've
[1:24:00] got to be Lord guide me in these things
[1:24:02] because when you after you see something
[1:24:04] you can't unsee it and it's not a lot of
[1:24:07] things are not worth seeing
[1:24:09] yep
[1:24:11] amen there's a lot of things like that
[1:24:13] so we've got to be very diligent about
[1:24:14] these things because the devil wants to
[1:24:16] Mark us with a thing doesn't mean we
[1:24:18] cannot be free of it right but why go
[1:24:21] through the drama of the whole thing
[1:24:22] where you just bypass the whole trial
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:25] I'll say about pornography one it's evil
[1:24:28] it is a it is a person
[1:24:30] right as people
[1:24:32] but don't let that ever become your
[1:24:34] normal of what love really is
[1:24:36] you shouldn't be watching it in the
[1:24:38] first place but don't let that be a
[1:24:39] normal that's not normal
[1:24:41] so don't but the thing is the world is
[1:24:43] conditioning children and my age to say
[1:24:47] that's normal that's not normal
[1:24:49] that is someone that someone's daughter
[1:24:51] someone's mother someone sister
[1:24:53] someone's brother whatever on there
[1:24:55] don't look at it it's not worth it
[1:24:59] okay yes it is very evil that's what the
[1:25:03] devil's done
[1:25:04] but don't be don't be trapped by these
[1:25:08] things
[1:25:10] but it produces this
[1:25:13] we shouldn't be a slave to these things
[1:25:17] remember they want to consume as much as
[1:25:19] your time and conscious attention as
[1:25:21] possible in the in the yellow in the
[1:25:23] middle
[1:25:27] um where are we now synapse uh it's
[1:25:29] called synapse pruning do we have oh
[1:25:31] wait maybe I can put that on can I put
[1:25:32] that on
[1:25:33] who wants a science video
[1:25:39] this is
[1:25:45] maturation
[1:25:46] and human brain starts its development
[1:25:49] in early embryonic stage and reaches the
[1:25:51] maximum number of synaptic connections
[1:25:53] sometime in early childhood at which
[1:25:55] point it is about double of what is
[1:25:57] normally present in an adult brain this
[1:26:00] is when the elimination of excess
[1:26:02] neuronal synapses known as synaptic
[1:26:04] pruning begins the process removes
[1:26:07] roughly half of all synapses and occurs
[1:26:10] mainly during adolescence but may
[1:26:12] continue well into young adulthood by
[1:26:15] getting rid of unnecessary connections
[1:26:17] synaptic pruning helps to refine neural
[1:26:19] circuits and increase Network efficiency
[1:26:24] computational models suggest that
[1:26:26] learning performance is optimal when
[1:26:27] synaptic connections are first over
[1:26:30] generated and then pruned an analogy is
[1:26:33] the task of writing an essay the easiest
[1:26:35] way is to put all possible ideas into a
[1:26:38] longer than needed first draft then trim
[1:26:40] it to keep only the essential points to
[1:26:43] create an effective final message
[1:26:46] synaptic pruning is activity driven and
[1:26:49] follows the use it or lose it rule
[1:26:51] synapses that are rarely used are
[1:26:53] eliminated while frequently used
[1:26:55] synapses are protected from removal
[1:26:58] in fact it has been shown that
[1:27:00] activation of the glutamate receptor
[1:27:02] nmda a marker associated with long-term
[1:27:05] memory retention and learning is the
[1:27:08] major protective factor for a synapse
[1:27:10] thus active synapses are selectively
[1:27:13] stabilized while Superfluous synapses
[1:27:15] are eliminated
[1:27:17] while the mechanism underlying synaptic
[1:27:19] pruning is in most part still a mystery
[1:27:22] recent Studies have implicated the
[1:27:24] brain's supportive cells known as glial
[1:27:26] cells or glia
[1:27:28] specifically two types of glia
[1:27:30] astrocytes and microglia are responsible
[1:27:33] for identifying and removing unnecessary
[1:27:35] neural connections a number of signaling
[1:27:38] molecules are involved in control of
[1:27:40] glial cell movement Target recognition
[1:27:43] and ingestion
[1:27:45] given the important role of synaptic
[1:27:47] pruning in sculpturing and refining the
[1:27:49] brain's neural circuits it is plausible
[1:27:52] that aberrant synaptic pruning is
[1:27:54] associated with a number of neurological
[1:27:56] disorders such as schizophrenia autism
[1:27:59] and epilepsy
[1:28:00] too much pruning results in shortage of
[1:28:03] connections and is thought to underlie
[1:28:05] schizophrenia
[1:28:06] the first occurrence of schizophrenia
[1:28:08] symptoms typically in late adolescents
[1:28:11] or early adulthood coincides with the
[1:28:13] time when synaptic pruning is most
[1:28:15] prominent
[1:28:16] too little pruning on the other hand
[1:28:18] leaves the brain with too many redundant
[1:28:21] connections which can be confusing
[1:28:23] inefficient and may limit learning
[1:28:26] potential
[1:28:27] excessive synapses are observed in
[1:28:29] autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy
[1:28:35] okay everyone got that use it or lose it
[1:28:39] don't be so addicted to one thing that
[1:28:41] your branches hardwired that way
[1:28:43] okay have a well-balanced life
[1:28:46] okay don't don't become a
[1:28:50] don't become an uh just someone who's a
[1:28:53] hermit
[1:28:54] and lives online
[1:28:56] you'll find the reason people are so
[1:28:58] there's so much mental illness is
[1:29:01] because people are less connected than
[1:29:03] ever before in this day even though we
[1:29:05] may be connected to hundreds and
[1:29:07] thousands of people all around the world
[1:29:08] on the internet but the relationship's
[1:29:10] not the same as person to person right
[1:29:12] so if you ever feel see a a big wait if
[1:29:16] I've got this here
[1:29:19] to show you've got to think about
[1:29:22] what if I've got this
[1:29:26] if you if you're addicted to something
[1:29:28] then you'll find yourself lethargic and
[1:29:31] not having no drive to do other things
[1:29:34] so if you're always driven to go on here
[1:29:37] and you're lethargic to just you don't
[1:29:38] have any you know to to connect with
[1:29:40] your family or connect with people in
[1:29:42] the real world and you say Lord help me
[1:29:47] because you know that that actually get
[1:29:49] enjoyment out of real life because we're
[1:29:52] here to live real life hey we shouldn't
[1:29:54] be living just an online as I said
[1:29:56] there's nothing wrong with this
[1:29:58] there's nothing wrong with this there's
[1:30:00] nothing wrong with computers but it's
[1:30:02] how we use them
[1:30:05] now
[1:30:07] as I was talking about here where I'm
[1:30:09] just going to wrap this up
[1:30:12] we live in a nervous
[1:30:15] neurotic age
[1:30:17] remember people get addicted to things
[1:30:19] because it diverts their attention from
[1:30:21] discomfort
[1:30:23] and this is an age where we build up
[1:30:25] pressure
[1:30:26] it's a high pressure h
[1:30:28] but we can lead off the pressure
[1:30:31] we can let off the pressure we can let
[1:30:33] God rewire our brains but remember it
[1:30:35] starts it's got to start with us
[1:30:37] actually doing something isn't it
[1:30:38] amazing how when we saw in that video
[1:30:40] there's that synaptic pruning all these
[1:30:43] different molecules and enzymes come
[1:30:45] together and start trimming
[1:30:47] but it all starts but but why does that
[1:30:49] happen because of choices
[1:30:51] right and you say well you may not feel
[1:30:53] like doing something different
[1:30:55] but if you begin to do it then your
[1:30:57] brain will rewire itself again in the
[1:31:00] right way
[1:31:02] okay
[1:31:03] now in a time of sickness when sickness
[1:31:05] strikes and doctor says there's nothing
[1:31:06] else I can do about it so this is a
[1:31:08] discomfort right don't build up pressure
[1:31:11] lead off the pressure call your past let
[1:31:13] them anoint you in all the prayer over
[1:31:14] you the prayer face shall save the sick
[1:31:16] let off the pressure see he's our refuge
[1:31:18] while you're in this Refuge you've got
[1:31:20] to write to anything that's in the
[1:31:21] Refuge and Christ is our refuge and
[1:31:23] everything we have need of is in him
[1:31:25] amen and sickness don't build up
[1:31:27] pressure let off pressure you say well I
[1:31:30] wonder brother Branham you don't have to
[1:31:31] wonder you just you just let off the
[1:31:33] pressure just let the pressure off
[1:31:34] commit your case to God and go on as if
[1:31:37] it was all over don't build up pressure
[1:31:40] it lets off pressure well you say I'm so
[1:31:43] worried brother Graham I just don't know
[1:31:45] let off the pressure amen and the City
[1:31:47] of Refuge he took your worry so you
[1:31:49] don't have to have it
[1:31:51] um cast your cares on him for he cares
[1:31:53] for you don't you worry about your cares
[1:31:55] that's his business
[1:31:58] right so don't don't don't go to
[1:32:00] anything
[1:32:01] to to to cure your discomfort apart from
[1:32:05] the Lord
[1:32:06] sure God is in everything I mean a lot
[1:32:08] of things right and we should we should
[1:32:12] have Fellowship one with another be
[1:32:13] connected to our family but our
[1:32:15] alternate our ultimate Comfort should be
[1:32:17] in the Lord himself I trust this is
[1:32:19] making sense Amen to the Bible says here
[1:32:21] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:32:23] mercies of God that you present your
[1:32:24] body is a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:32:26] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:32:28] reasonable service oh we're still there
[1:32:30] good and be not conformed to this world
[1:32:33] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:32:34] your mind that ye may prove what is uh
[1:32:37] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:32:40] perfect will of God
[1:32:42] so if you're addicted to this I think to
[1:32:46] be honest I'm addicted to this I need
[1:32:48] the Lord to help me I'll be honest I'm
[1:32:50] on it too much
[1:32:52] I want my mind to be renewed
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:57] so how's your brain
[1:33:00] I trust is good if not you say Lord
[1:33:03] help me
[1:33:05] help me change my behaviors and what I'm
[1:33:07] doing because really if you think about
[1:33:09] it
[1:33:10] how beneficial was it for scrolling for
[1:33:12] an hour
[1:33:14] did you really need to read that article
[1:33:16] did you really need to watch that video
[1:33:17] did you really no did you really what
[1:33:19] benefit has it given to your life
[1:33:21] probably not a
[1:33:23] you know so just think about that BC
[1:33:26] they want you as connected as possible
[1:33:28] amen so let's let's have the musicians
[1:33:30] this afternoon
[1:33:31] I see it's four o'clock sorry thank you
[1:33:33] for letting me take your time
[1:33:38] amen let's just um
[1:33:40] yeah let's just stand and brother kid
[1:33:42] I'm just going to pray and then I'll now
[1:33:43] then I'll pass the service over to you
[1:33:45] so
[1:33:46] so I enjoyed that brother Jimmy amen
[1:33:49] who's influencing you
[1:33:51] and then I could say part two what's the
[1:33:53] effect of the influence is it making you
[1:33:56] more like the Lord is it making you more
[1:33:57] connected to your family to your spouse
[1:34:00] to your friends to Brothers and Sisters
[1:34:03] in Christ you know is it making you more
[1:34:05] connected or is it actually lowering
[1:34:07] your empathy and making you withdrawal
[1:34:10] so I trust our influence today is the
[1:34:13] Lord himself amen so let's balance and
[1:34:16] we'll pray that I'll turn the service
[1:34:17] over to you bro I mean let's pray
[1:34:19] together gracious Lord Jesus we love you
[1:34:22] so much dear God please Lord I pray
[1:34:24] father you touch your hearts Lord touch
[1:34:26] our minds o god father if we have gone
[1:34:29] off Lord I feel I'm guilty of it Lord of
[1:34:31] being addicted to to the internet Lord
[1:34:33] uh to social media to the news to
[1:34:36] different things Lord that really the
[1:34:38] vast majority of it doesn't profit me
[1:34:40] none so I pray Lord God you'd forgive me
[1:34:43] Lord Jesus and I pray Lord you you'd
[1:34:45] renew my mind father anyone else here
[1:34:47] Lord Jesus it needs a touch from you o
[1:34:49] God Father's become addicted to to to
[1:34:52] anything father that's Lord that Lord
[1:34:55] that Lord that's walled them up in a
[1:34:57] prison somewhere oh God that they've got
[1:34:58] to be online or somewhere else and
[1:35:00] they're disconnected from reality Lord I
[1:35:02] pray you touch them too oh god father I
[1:35:04] pray would be like Isaiah and the temple
[1:35:06] oh Lord we have a visitation from you
[1:35:08] Lord Jesus Lord Uzziah had to die that
[1:35:11] that that that that influence had to go
[1:35:13] because we know Isaiah the prophet seen
[1:35:15] too much on the king but Lord you had to
[1:35:18] reveal yourself to Isaiah you had to
[1:35:20] write a Bible through him oh God and
[1:35:22] Lord I believe you you want to write the
[1:35:23] Bible through our lives oh God not not
[1:35:26] pen and paper necessarily like Isaiah
[1:35:28] but but a living Bible Lord that your
[1:35:30] word would put on flesh in our lives o
[1:35:32] God that father all 66 books would be
[1:35:35] manifested in our lives oh god father of
[1:35:38] your character of Your Love Lord of all
[1:35:39] that you are so I pray you grant it dear
[1:35:42] God pray you'd wash us in your blood
[1:35:43] Lord we love you we just commit
[1:35:45] ourselves Lord into your hands in Jesus
[1:35:48] Christ's name amen
[1:35:50] amen God bless you friends Amen brother
[1:35:52] God bless you bro amen
[1:35:57] amen God bless you brother Ben thank you
[1:35:59] for that
[1:36:01] um if we could just sing
[1:36:03] Jesus be the center
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:14] be the same
[1:36:24] be my life
[1:36:34] oh Jesus
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:57] things
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:14] Jesus
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:38] in yourself
[1:37:41] be the reasons

[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:19] oh Jesus
