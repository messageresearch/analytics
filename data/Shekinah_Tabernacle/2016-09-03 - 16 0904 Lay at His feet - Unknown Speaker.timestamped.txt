[35:58] sayth unto me I will do and she went
[36:01] down unto the floor and did according to
[36:03] all that her mother-in-law bade her and
[36:05] when Boaz had eaten and drunk his heart
[36:07] was merry he went to lie down in the end
[36:09] of the Heap of corn and she came softly
[36:12] in and covered his feet uncovered his
[36:14] feet and laid her down and it came to
[36:16] pass at midnight that the man was afraid
[36:19] and turned himself and behold a woman
[36:21] lay at his feet and he said who art thou
[36:26] and she answered now notice she answered
[36:28] I am Ruth thine handmaid spread
[36:31] therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid
[36:34] for thou art a near Kinsman and he said
[36:37] blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter
[36:39] for thou Hast showed more kindness in
[36:42] the latter end than at the beginning in
[36:44] as much as thou Fest not a young man
[36:47] neither rich or poor and now my daughter
[36:49] fear not for I will do to thee all that
[36:52] thou requirest for all the city of my
[36:55] people doth know that thou art a
[36:57] virtuous woman and now it is true that I
[37:00] am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a
[37:02] Kinsman nearer than i t this night and
[37:05] it shall be in the morning that if he
[37:07] will perform unto thee the part of a
[37:09] Kinsman well let him do the kinsman's
[37:11] part pardon me but if he will not do the
[37:14] part of a Kinsman to thee Then I then I
[37:16] will do the part pardon me of a Kinsman
[37:19] to thee as the Lord liveth lie down
[37:20] until the morning and she lay at his
[37:22] feet until the morning and Rose up
[37:24] before one could know another and he and
[37:27] he said
[37:28] let it not be known that a woman came
[37:30] into the floor may the Lord bless his
[37:33] word you may be
[37:34] seated now this may seem like a unusual
[37:38] unusual scripture reading but you know
[37:41] we I want to I want to approach a a a a
[37:45] topic if I may if I could put a title to
[37:47] it I want to speak about the
[37:48] responsibility of our
[37:50] Kinsmen now Ruth we understand you know
[37:53] the Book of Ruth is more than just a
[37:54] nice love story but but you're you're
[37:57] Ruth amen Ruth is a is a story of
[38:01] redemption and it's not just Ruth uh
[38:04] being redeemed you know it's not just
[38:05] put in the Bible just to fill in some
[38:07] pages buddies but God is laying out a
[38:09] patent for you and God is laying out a
[38:12] patn for all the bride of Christ now
[38:15] before so before this moment that we
[38:17] just read it was Ruth that was doing
[38:20] everything so she in the beginning in
[38:23] the in in chapter one you know she had
[38:25] to decide to to follow her mother-in-law
[38:29] to
[38:30] Israel and and she came to the
[38:33] conclusion in in in in verse 16 you know
[38:37] um because Naomi said to Ruth and to her
[38:39] other daughter-in-law go back to Moab
[38:42] I'm going to Israel you know just go
[38:44] back to your father's house but then
[38:46] Ruth made a decision she said I will not
[38:49] entreat me not to leave thee or to
[38:51] return from following after thee forther
[38:53] for where thou goest I will go and where
[38:56] thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people
[38:59] shall be my people and thy God be my God
[39:02] where thou die I will die and where I'll
[39:04] be buried and and there will I be buried
[39:08] Lord do so to me and more also if I
[39:11] ought but death part thee in me so she
[39:14] had to decide that she was never going
[39:17] to return to Moab unless her
[39:19] daughter-in-law went back to Moab amen
[39:21] she had to make a decision I'm not
[39:23] coming back to this place anymore I am
[39:26] going where you go and if you go back
[39:28] here I'm coming back here she makes a
[39:30] decision I will never return to my old
[39:33] life anymore remember Moab and Israel
[39:35] they were different different nations
[39:37] they lived a different kind of lives
[39:39] amen so she had to make a decision this
[39:41] old life that I once lived I'm never
[39:43] going to live again Hallelujah and but
[39:46] you know I'm going because I will never
[39:49] return to this old life because I'm
[39:51] going with you Naomi now there is no
[39:53] record that Ruth ever went to Israel
[39:55] before there's no record of it in this
[39:57] scripture she didn't know where she was
[39:59] going that's right amen no doubt many of
[40:03] you were asked where are you going am me
[40:06] I want to I just trust God will make
[40:07] this just so personal that when you read
[40:10] the book of Ruth you always just see
[40:11] your name in Ruth and it's not the Book
[40:13] of Ruth it's the book of whatever your
[40:16] name is amen so many you know no doubt
[40:19] people would have asked Ruth where are
[40:20] you going I'm going to Israel have you
[40:22] ever been there I've never been there
[40:24] before I'm following my mother-in-law
[40:26] and so many many people would ask where
[40:28] are you going that's right amen Israel
[40:31] believed in a different God to Moab
[40:34] Israel had one God Moab had a whole
[40:36] bunch of gods amen Ruth you know no
[40:39] doubt people would have said to Ruth
[40:40] Ruth don't you know Israel doesn't
[40:42] believe in three persons in the godhead
[40:45] amen don't you know they believe in a
[40:47] prophet that led their forefathers out
[40:49] of Egypt into this land they live in and
[40:51] that this Prophet supposedly received
[40:54] the word of God on a mountain don't you
[40:56] know that they think they an exclusive
[40:58] bunch of people amen don't you think
[41:00] they think they're a special class of
[41:02] people God made them a special class of
[41:04] people I mean it wasn't you know it
[41:06] wasn't they made themselves special God
[41:08] made them special and it was it's not
[41:10] that we try and make ourselves anything
[41:12] God's made you something you got to know
[41:15] who you are in Christ amen so people no
[41:18] doubt would have you know and then they
[41:20] would have said that you know because
[41:21] Moab had had prophets too they had balam
[41:24] they had prophets but they say they have
[41:27] this prophet and and he received the
[41:28] word of God and he's the only source of
[41:30] Truth and they would have said Ruth that
[41:33] sounds a bit cultish to me
[41:36] amen amen and so people no doubt you
[41:39] would have had that conversation with a
[41:41] lot of people why do you go to that
[41:43] place why do you listen to what they're
[41:44] saying why do you listen to those
[41:46] sermons it sounds all a bit cultish down
[41:48] there they say they have truth we all
[41:50] have the Bible who has the
[41:52] interpretation of the word
[41:55] amen but is but Ruth was
[41:58] told Ruth was told that Israel had bread
[42:03] and she was hungry amen and there's
[42:06] something in the believer that their
[42:08] hunger is only satisfied from The Bread
[42:10] of Heaven amen there's nothing else will
[42:13] satisfy the hunger and the saint of God
[42:15] doesn't matter where they're born what
[42:17] they're from what they used to do
[42:19] there's something in them says I'm still
[42:21] hungry amen because in Ruth 1: 6 uh
[42:26] Naomi arose with her daughters-in-law
[42:28] that she might return from the country
[42:30] of Moab for she had heard in the country
[42:32] of Moab that how the Lord had visited
[42:35] his people giving them bread so that's
[42:37] all she knew about Israel there's food
[42:39] there I mean there's food among these
[42:42] people that are not my people and that's
[42:44] what made her go amen amen she didn't
[42:48] know anything she didn't know anything
[42:50] about Israel's God the only the only
[42:53] living example of a was Naomi and when
[42:56] Naomi went back Israel she said don't
[42:58] call me don't call me Noom anymore call
[43:00] me Mara cuz my life has become bitter
[43:03] and Ruth was part of that
[43:05] bitterness amen Ruth was part of her
[43:07] bitterness and but yet somehow there was
[43:10] something in Ruth says where you die
[43:11] I'll die amen your God will be my God
[43:15] the only thing she saw Naomi's God do
[43:17] was afflict Naomi that's all she saw of
[43:20] her life Nomi wasn't living a prosperous
[43:22] life she didn't have it all together it
[43:24] wasn't all going perfectly well amen she
[43:28] didn't she you know Nomi didn't say well
[43:30] my God is a good God and you know maybe
[43:32] she did but oh look at it manifest how
[43:35] is it good if look what's happened to
[43:37] you but Ruth just said my God will your
[43:39] God will be my God where you die I'll
[43:42] die Hallelujah I trust that you've made
[43:46] that same kind of decision amen that
[43:49] you've you've burnt every bridge amen
[43:52] there's no turning back yeah I I I made
[43:55] my mind up years ago there's nothing to
[43:57] go back to the world has nothing for me
[44:00] denomination has nothing for me am mean
[44:02] there's just no appeal in there I know
[44:04] what it does and it just destroys people
[44:07] hallelujah so I made up my mind wherever
[44:10] this leads me I don't know where it's
[44:11] going to lead me I don't know where it's
[44:13] going to lead me but I'm not worried
[44:15] about the details just lead me Lord amen
[44:18] I trust that you you've had that same
[44:20] kind of
[44:23] experience now Ruth after this they come
[44:26] back in too they come back into
[44:28] Bethlehem the house of God's bread which
[44:30] is what Bethlehem means and there's the
[44:32] harvest season is going on and then so
[44:35] Ruth decides and you know if you know
[44:37] the kinsman redeemer sermon this is all
[44:39] in there and then Ruth labors in the
[44:41] field to find just enough food for her
[44:45] and her
[44:46] mother-in-law now but when she was in
[44:49] the field she finds herself in boaz's
[44:51] field she doesn't find herself in any
[44:53] other field and Boaz is the lord of the
[44:56] Harvest
[44:59] and he comes down and he speaks to his
[45:01] Reapers he says who is this gleaning you
[45:04] know among the other maidens and they
[45:06] say this is Ruth the
[45:08] moabitas and he instructs his young
[45:12] men don't touch her leave her drop
[45:15] handfuls of purpose for her you know
[45:17] give her a bit of food a bit more food
[45:19] along the way and it's so wonderful when
[45:22] when God drops a few more blessings your
[45:24] way am mean that's handfuls of purpose
[45:27] he just drops them as you're reading and
[45:29] praying he just gives you a few more
[45:31] blessings every so often he sweeps
[45:33] through the church every so often Amen
[45:35] to you know to give us a few more
[45:37] blessings and then so
[45:40] Boaz instructs Ruth you stay in this
[45:43] field you don't go to any other field
[45:45] you have protection in this field and we
[45:47] know that the field remember this is
[45:51] this is speaking of you you're not out
[45:52] in a literal field finding barley amen
[45:56] but the field is is is the word of God
[45:59] and if I had a message book I'd put it
[46:00] in here too CU to me it's the same thing
[46:02] cuz the message reveals Christ in
[46:05] here who who of us were trinitarian some
[46:08] of us were trinitarian some of us
[46:10] probably believed in two at one stage
[46:13] some of us oh how who got baptized wrong
[46:15] some of us got baptized wrong well what
[46:18] was happening you know because but what
[46:20] made this all clear not just by all of
[46:23] it clear the message made it clear
[46:25] because it reveals Jesus Jesus in here
[46:28] it's not another testimony it just
[46:30] reveals Jesus in here that's why just
[46:32] like when I first to do you first I do
[46:34] Mission work and I still do it this way
[46:37] to a large extent I preach the message
[46:39] but by never quoting the message amen
[46:42] because you go and you show them in the
[46:44] scripture this is what's happening this
[46:45] is where we are this is the baptism this
[46:47] is the godhead and it's just all in
[46:49] here and it's proving that it's not what
[46:52] brother Braham said the reason he said
[46:53] that is cuz it's in here and the reason
[46:55] he said it's because God revealed the
[46:56] truth of the scripture to him amen amen
[47:00] it's that
[47:01] simple because it reveals it in here so
[47:04] that is the field that you're to stay in
[47:07] you understand and if you stay in that
[47:09] field there's
[47:10] protection because she was protected
[47:12] when she stayed in the field now Boaz we
[47:16] know is Christ Ruth is you he I trust
[47:19] you say praise God Boaz boaz's fi is the
[47:23] word of God the true interpretation of
[47:25] the scripture which I said the Mage
[47:27] reveals Christ in the scripture the true
[47:29] interpretation but now but I want you to
[47:32] notice there is a time when you when
[47:37] when when the word begins to be opened
[47:39] up to you and you say oh this message
[47:42] feeds my soul how glorious it is yeah
[47:46] because she'll get a handful of purpose
[47:47] look we're going to eat a bit better
[47:48] today no me look we're going have a few
[47:50] more cakes we're going to have a feast
[47:53] amen and that's true that's Ruth getting
[47:55] food from Bo's F I've never heard the
[47:58] word like this before it fits all
[48:00] together I'm so glad we're not walking
[48:02] in confusion I'm so glad we're not
[48:04] walking in man's ideas amen but we're
[48:07] walking in thus sayith the Lord and it's
[48:10] glorious but that's still not it amen
[48:14] don't just now don't just stay at the
[48:17] point where the word is glorious you got
[48:19] to come into Union amen Ruth in boz's
[48:23] field though protected though getting
[48:26] drops handfuls of blessings she's still
[48:28] a moot us she is still a
[48:30] widower
[48:33] amen it's still not there
[48:37] now Ruth chapter 3 before that it was
[48:41] Ruth doing everything but then now she
[48:43] CES to a place where then after this now
[48:47] Boaz starts acting and she comes to a
[48:51] place where now Ruth becomes his
[48:54] responsibility Hallelujah amen if you
[48:58] want God to act on your behalf you have
[49:00] to find where he laid
[49:02] down amen Mark the place he laid Lord
[49:06] and uncover his feet and lay down there
[49:10] that's what Nomi told told her to do you
[49:13] to find the place he laid down and then
[49:15] when you find that place lay down at his
[49:18] feet and then he will begin to act on
[49:20] your
[49:21] behalf amen I try this is not
[49:24] complicated amen I just but I want to
[49:26] Anchor in real deep because the place he
[49:29] laid was
[49:30] Calvary amen I'm going to read this from
[49:32] the kinsman redeemer remember when Ruth
[49:35] came to this place then Boaz had to act
[49:39] amen Boaz had to act when she came here
[49:43] amen and we have a Boaz today our Lord
[49:45] Jesus Christ who's alive and well who's
[49:48] among us
[49:50] hallelujah now in Kingsman Redeemer 1960
[49:54] if you haven't heard it please go listen
[49:56] he said
[49:58] uh now put thy garments upon thee s
[50:01] actually no me said this not take thy
[50:03] garments off of thee how contrary of
[50:05] today G thy garments upon thee when you
[50:07] go to meet him he's going to win oaly
[50:10] tonight go down put your garments on you
[50:12] cover yourself up to meet him says today
[50:15] they want to uncover themselves cover
[50:17] yourself go down where he winth barley
[50:20] and then Mark the place where he lieth
[50:22] did you go did you do it on gol gotha
[50:26] many years years ago I marked in my
[50:27] heart where he laid down his life that
[50:30] he might take me Hallelujah Mark the
[50:34] place that he lieth down watch where he
[50:36] laid that's what every believer should
[50:39] do mark what he done for you he says
[50:43] last Sunday's message to visit to
[50:45] Calvary mark what he did for you she
[50:47] said Mark where he lieth down then when
[50:50] he lith down to sleep to rest you go lie
[50:54] down by his feet not his head his feet
[50:57] unworthy take the blanket that he was
[50:59] covered with and pull it over you you
[51:02] see it oh my I know you think I'm a
[51:05] fanatic but that suits me just right and
[51:07] I say amen that's exactly how I feel
[51:09] that spirit of God Mark where he lay at
[51:12] Calvary where he laid down um that just
[51:17] suits me no where he laid down the tomb
[51:19] of Gethsemane Mark and crawl up to his
[51:21] feet and lie down there and die to
[51:24] yourself there you are cover yourself
[51:26] over with his skirt she said skirt she
[51:28] called it and Ruth said what what you
[51:31] say I'll do see this is why part of the
[51:34] Bride what everything you say that I'll
[51:38] do amen because it's a because there's a
[51:41] intent in mind and it intent is a
[51:44] union oh what a clear-cut decision for
[51:47] the believer this is the same quote what
[51:49] the Bible says that I'll do it says
[51:51] repent and be baptized in the name of
[51:53] Jesus Christ I'll do it if it says go
[51:55] into all the world preach the gospel
[51:57] I'll do it if it says whatever it says
[51:59] Jesus Christ the same
[52:01] yesterday um today and forever wherever
[52:04] it says for me I'll uh to do I'll do it
[52:07] see the church taking its orders from
[52:09] the word she laid down now remember that
[52:12] was a disgrace for that young widow
[52:14] woman to be laying by the side of this
[52:16] man at his feet a disgrace to the
[52:18] outside world oh can you stand it here
[52:21] it is look here it is the church the
[52:23] young woman the young man or old or
[52:25] young as asked to separate themselves
[52:27] from the world come into a place a
[52:29] kingdom of a kingdom of the Holy Ghost
[52:32] that's disgraceful to the world in their
[52:34] own heart they know what it's all about
[52:37] but to the world they become a fanatic
[52:39] they become a Holy Roller or something
[52:41] on that idea some disgraceful name but
[52:44] the church has asked to do it are you
[52:45] willing to Mark the place and lie down
[52:48] and let the world call you anything they
[52:51] want
[52:53] to this is what she had to do
[52:56] amen and when she did this now and we
[52:59] read the scripture he woke up and she
[53:03] says to him cover cover me with your
[53:06] spirit amen cover my
[53:09] shame cover my first nature amen cover
[53:14] my identity so people no longer see me
[53:16] in my Brokenness they see you in your
[53:19] glory amen this is this is what she's
[53:22] asking him to do because she laid down
[53:25] where he laid down
[53:27] and she laid down at his feet and if you
[53:29] lay down at the foot of the cross where
[53:31] Jesus laid down then Jesus begins to act
[53:34] on your behalf hallelujah amen and then
[53:36] because this was her request I don't
[53:38] want to be a moabitas anymore Hallelujah
[53:42] I don't want to be a widow anymore I
[53:44] don't want to be an alien in a Strange
[53:46] Land anymore I don't want to be an alien
[53:48] from the economy of God anymore I want
[53:50] in Hallelujah that's why she laid down
[53:53] there and says cover me with your
[53:56] hallelujah it's like MTH which was
[53:58] Jonathan's son and then David after he's
[54:01] King he says now does Jonathan have any
[54:03] children and then he says yeah he's got
[54:05] one mbth then mbth comes in as a
[54:10] and and then David says you know what
[54:13] happened and mes was scared because they
[54:15] were there you know the house of Saul
[54:17] the House of David they were enemies but
[54:20] remember David swore to Jonathan I'll be
[54:23] good to your children you be good to
[54:25] mine and the o was forever settled and
[54:28] then so he wanted to so he made the oath
[54:30] and he wanted to put it right amen
[54:33] that's why he inquired about MTH and he
[54:35] was scared to come into the prince of
[54:37] David because remember if MTH M should
[54:40] have been on the throne you following me
[54:43] he should have been on the throne so he
[54:44] was David's enemy technically as we were
[54:48] amen but then God called us into his
[54:50] presence and we were born in a crippled
[54:53] State we were blind spiritually blind
[54:56] having no idea what was going on in this
[54:58] world we were crippled we couldn't walk
[55:01] the way we should have walked Hallelujah
[55:03] and then he comes and he because he's
[55:04] lame in his feet you go read the story
[55:06] it's a beautiful I trust you put
[55:07] yourself in that story and then David
[55:10] says come and eat at table Hallelujah
[55:13] and then when MF slip under the table

[57:26] you still got your Bibles handy we're
[57:28] going to read the law of the kinsman
[57:32] redeemer now in
[57:35] Israel well we'll just read this now the
[57:37] devil loves to tell us you'll Beyond
[57:40] Redemption who's who's been down that
[57:42] road who's received that mail

[57:48] up because there's a law remember God
[57:51] works according to his law amen he he is
[57:54] a man of his word yes he doesn't go
[57:56] around his law he doesn't try and cut a
[57:58] corner he works according to his law now
[58:02] Leviticus 25 see this is what I love
[58:04] this is what I love about this message
[58:06] it makes Jesus you the Old Testament is
[58:08] not a story book that's right and it
[58:10] glorifies God it glorifies his
[58:13] Redemption all I see in this message oh
[58:15] it's from the from the beginning to the
[58:17] end from the opening of the seals I see
[58:18] a lamb step forth I see a Kinsman St
[58:21] forth we're going to come to that later
[58:22] but it's just so glorious now it says uh
[58:25] L 25 and
[58:28] 47 oh love of God how rich and pure
[58:32] hallelujah how measureless and strong
[58:35] Hallelujah I trust you're feeling like
[58:36] I'm feeling just now it says in verse 47
[58:40] and if a so joura or a stranger wax Rich
[58:43] by thee that thy brother that dwelleth
[58:45] by thee wax poor and sell himself unto
[58:48] the stranger or soier or by thee or to
[58:50] the stock of the stranger's family after
[58:53] that he is sold he may be redeemed again
[58:56] one of his Brethren May redeem him so
[58:59] notice he may be
[59:00] redeemed that's you got to always
[59:03] remember this principle if you're a son
[59:05] or daughter of God you're redeemable and
[59:08] you must be redeemed amen you cannot be
[59:11] left in slavery you cannot be left in
[59:14] slavery amen either his uncle or his
[59:16] uncle's son may redeem or any that is
[59:18] nigh of kin unto him of his family may
[59:21] redeem him for if he be able he may
[59:24] redeem himself and he shall reckon with
[59:27] him that brought him from the year that
[59:29] he was sold to him until the Year of
[59:31] Jubilee and the price of his sale shall
[59:34] be according unto the number of years
[59:36] according to the time of a h servant
[59:38] shall it be with him if there be yet
[59:41] many years behind according unto them he
[59:43] shall give again the price of his
[59:45] Redemption out of the money that he was
[59:47] brought for and if there remain but few
[59:49] years until the Year of Jubilee then he
[59:51] shall count with him and according to
[59:53] his years shall he give him again the
[59:56] price of his Redemption amen so the law
[59:59] was if he's an Israelite he is
[1:00:03] redeemable and he must go free amen
[1:00:07] because there Comes The Year of Jubilee
[1:00:09] as well where everyone has to go free
[1:00:12] that chooses to go free okay so it's a
[1:00:15] law of God Amen so if you're a son or
[1:00:19] daughter of
[1:00:21] God you have to be
[1:00:23] redeemed amen hallelujah
[1:00:27] so the kinsman
[1:00:29] redeemer has to be a Kinsman or a
[1:00:31] relation yeah he has to be able to do it
[1:00:34] he has to have the price the money to do
[1:00:36] it and he has to be willing to do it
[1:00:39] amen you know those are the three things
[1:00:42] and
[1:00:43] so Boz now was Ruth's
[1:00:48] Kinsman but part of the Redemption of
[1:00:53] Ruth was that the Kinsman has to marry
[1:00:56] Ruth and raise up children in place of
[1:01:00] her first husband yeah that's part of
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:03] requirement and we can read about this
[1:01:05] in Ruth chapter
[1:01:07] 4 sorry just a
[1:01:13] second now this is it's going to read uh
[1:01:17] three verses in Ruth chapter 4 from
[1:01:18] verse
[1:01:20] three now we said unto the Kinsman so
[1:01:23] this is now the nearer Kinsman is
[1:01:24] actually the devil
[1:01:26] to humanity if you can accept that or
[1:01:28] not because when when the devil came in
[1:01:31] the garden and he injected himself into
[1:01:34] the human race that and we were born in
[1:01:36] a fallen State we're actually naturally
[1:01:39] more related if I can put it this way to
[1:01:42] the serpent amen than God yeah so the
[1:01:47] near Kinsman was actually the devil yeah
[1:01:50] and he does not worried he's not worried
[1:01:54] well let's just read this and he said
[1:01:56] unto the kingsman noi that has come
[1:01:58] again out of the country of Moab sth the
[1:02:00] pel of land which was our brother
[1:02:04] ales and I thought to advise thee now
[1:02:07] Satan and and Jesus aren't Brothers by
[1:02:09] the way it's just part of the story okay
[1:02:12] but don't don't go to that conclusion
[1:02:14] because Jesus says he has no part in me
[1:02:16] I have no part in him amen and you have
[1:02:19] to come to that same conclusion and I
[1:02:20] trust you come to it to the end he has
[1:02:22] no part of me I have no part of him I
[1:02:24] have no part of Satan whatsoever
[1:02:27] amen which was our brother ales and I
[1:02:29] thought to advise the saying before AB
[1:02:32] before the inhabitants and before the
[1:02:33] Elders of my people that if thou will
[1:02:35] redeem it redeem it but if thou will not
[1:02:37] redeem it then tell me that I may know
[1:02:39] for there is none to redeem it besides
[1:02:41] thee and I after thee and then this
[1:02:44] other Kinsman said I will redeem it okay
[1:02:47] but now notice the next verse but then
[1:02:49] Boaz then say
[1:02:51] Bo what day that thou buyest the field
[1:02:54] of the hand of Nomi thou must buy also
[1:02:56] of Ruth the moabitas the wife of the
[1:02:58] Dead to raise up the name of the Dead
[1:03:00] upon his upon his inheritance so it's a
[1:03:03] requirement of the Redemption you have
[1:03:04] to marry Ruth and if you keep reading he
[1:03:07] says I can't do it amen because only God
[1:03:11] has life in him you understand so Ruth's
[1:03:14] Redemption was tied into marriage with
[1:03:17] Boaz amen that's was how she was
[1:03:20] redeemed is because she got married to
[1:03:22] Boaz you following me amen so
[1:03:26] now what so Jesus
[1:03:29] now why did Jesus
[1:03:32] die
[1:03:34] okay
[1:03:35] Jesus Jesus died for
[1:03:38] you that he would take your first nature
[1:03:42] amen he would take your first nature and
[1:03:45] he would crucify that man amen he would
[1:03:48] take him away and kill him that you can
[1:03:50] be married to another amen because you
[1:03:53] got to understand Ruth Ruth first
[1:03:55] identity I'm a moabitas I'm a widow I
[1:03:59] have nothing I'm destitute in a foreign
[1:04:01] land the only way that could change her
[1:04:04] station in life and her identity was
[1:04:07] that Boaz would take her and marry her
[1:04:10] and then after their marriage she's no
[1:04:11] longer rotth the moabitas but she's Mrs
[1:04:14] Boaz of Bethlehem amen and then
[1:04:17] everything Boaz is she becomes
[1:04:20] Hallelujah so she's no longer a moabitas
[1:04:22] who is outside the economy of God
[1:04:24] remember Moab it even says in the law
[1:04:27] Moab shall not come into the
[1:04:28] congregation of Israel you got to
[1:04:31] understand Grace oversteps the lawj amen
[1:04:34] it oversteps the law
[1:04:38] Hallelujah I find this real
[1:04:44] quick he says in the he says in the
[1:04:47] breach
[1:04:48] message he parallels now forgive me if
[1:04:51] I'm jumping around but brother B
[1:04:54] parallels Bo is claiming Ruth and
[1:04:56] redeeming Ruth as the lamb taking the
[1:04:59] book Amen to get you an understanding of
[1:05:03] oh it's a lamb taking a book no as I
[1:05:05] said last Sunday no it's God claiming
[1:05:07] you amen it's GL God claiming you and
[1:05:11] restoring you to what you're meant to be
[1:05:14] amen and so we needed you it even you
[1:05:17] know we read there in Leviticus if a man
[1:05:18] can redeem himself he can do it but no
[1:05:21] man naturally can redeem himself from
[1:05:24] being born under the curse of the law
[1:05:27] amen because we're born with a fallen
[1:05:30] nature so we're all in prison doesn't
[1:05:33] matter doesn't matter if it's a nice
[1:05:35] prison you know there's like overseas
[1:05:36] the gang leaders they have a like a
[1:05:38] palace in prison they're still in pal
[1:05:40] you know they're still in prison you can
[1:05:41] have the nicest prison you want you're
[1:05:43] still in prison we needed a man we
[1:05:46] needed a Kinsman to come we needed a
[1:05:49] relation to come who was not born the
[1:05:51] way we were born amen that wasn't born
[1:05:54] under the curse of this first nature
[1:05:56] amen but was born into the human race
[1:05:59] Hallelujah so blessed by the Anisa's
[1:06:02] Bible story their book there it's got a
[1:06:04] like a timeline and and the heading is
[1:06:06] the baby everyone wanted and it just has
[1:06:10] uh pictures of prophets prophesying of
[1:06:12] the Redeemer to come Hallelujah because
[1:06:15] they're all looking for a redeemer to
[1:06:17] come we need a Kinsman Lord when you
[1:06:19] will when you will send this Kinsman to
[1:06:21] undo all these things and God said I
[1:06:24] can't send someone else I've got come
[1:06:26] Hallelujah so God the word became flesh
[1:06:29] amen the Kinsman became flesh and dwelt
[1:06:31] among us hallelujah and he and he did
[1:06:34] that because he he knew you were coming
[1:06:36] remember God he does things once but he
[1:06:39] attributes it to all his Believers amen
[1:06:42] that's why Jesus had he only had to die
[1:06:45] once 2,000 years ago but he did it one
[1:06:48] by one offering and so then when he went
[1:06:51] to Calvary he took your son to Calvary
[1:06:53] you weren't even born but the joy that
[1:06:55] was set before him he knew you'd be here
[1:06:57] in this day he knew the struggles you
[1:07:00] would have he knew the battles you would
[1:07:01] fight and he and he knew all those
[1:07:04] things and he picked them up Hallelujah
[1:07:06] all my children are coming back to me
[1:07:08] Hallelujah and he took your sin up that
[1:07:10] cross that day Hallelujah and he died
[1:07:13] there he died in your place am mean cuz
[1:07:15] someone who's dead they're not subject
[1:07:17] to the law anymore you understand so if
[1:07:20] you're dead in Christ Hallelujah no
[1:07:23] you're not subject to the law anymore if
[1:07:24] you're dead
[1:07:26] amen because a dead man the law doesn't
[1:07:28] affect a dead man he's dead Hallelujah
[1:07:30] and if you're dead well the it doesn't
[1:07:32] bother me anymore why is that cuz this
[1:07:35] this guy's still moving but he's dead
[1:07:38] Hallelujah 2007 I died September time I
[1:07:42] died Hallelujah I'm so glad I died that
[1:07:46] day amen and then God has just been more
[1:07:49] glorious all the time sure there's been
[1:07:50] battles struggles ups and downs lefts
[1:07:52] and rights whatever more but the
[1:07:54] shepherd I the Kinsman grabs you by the
[1:07:57] hand and make sure you're going to make
[1:08:00] it Hallelujah and so now let's read in
[1:08:05] Romans chapter 7 let's just read
[1:08:10] this
[1:08:15] Hallelujah Romans 7 verse1 brother bam
[1:08:18] uses this uses this scripture as a as a
[1:08:21] text for a sermon the invisible Union of
[1:08:23] the bride of Christ
[1:08:25] and many people see it as a negative
[1:08:27] sermon I do not see it as a negative
[1:08:29] sermon because he's telling he's he's
[1:08:31] making a declaration let's just read
[1:08:34] this before I go on know you not
[1:08:35] brethren for I speak to them that know
[1:08:38] the law how that the law hath dominion
[1:08:40] over a man as long as he lives for the
[1:08:43] woman which has a husband is bound by
[1:08:45] the law to her husband as long as he
[1:08:47] liveth but if the husband be dead she is
[1:08:50] loose from the law of her husband so
[1:08:53] then if while her husband liveth she is
[1:08:56] also married to another man she shall be
[1:08:58] called an adulterous but if her husband
[1:09:01] be dead she is free from that law so
[1:09:03] that she is no more adulterous though
[1:09:05] she be married to another man therefore
[1:09:07] my brethren ye also are become dead to
[1:09:10] the law by the body of Christ that you
[1:09:12] should be married to another even to him
[1:09:15] who is raised from the dead that we
[1:09:17] should bring forth fruit unto God so
[1:09:23] now in The Invisible Union sermon you go
[1:09:25] listen to it amen you go listen to it
[1:09:28] God's making a declaration he takes a
[1:09:30] scripture and he says it's a higher form
[1:09:31] of marriage and divorce and he speaking
[1:09:33] of a people now where Jesus at
[1:09:37] Calvary amen took your took your first
[1:09:41] nature took it to the Cross amen killed
[1:09:44] it Hallelujah by one offering remember
[1:09:47] the lamb was slam before the foundation
[1:09:49] of the world so it's already done but it
[1:09:51] has to be expressed down into time amen
[1:09:54] so it's already done the battle is over
[1:09:55] the victory is won you just got to walk
[1:09:57] into it Hallelujah just walk into it
[1:10:00] it's already done and so he took your
[1:10:02] first nature your first Union that you
[1:10:04] were born with and he took it to Calvary
[1:10:07] and he killed it there amen that you
[1:10:09] just wouldn't be now oh now I'm a widow
[1:10:11] no he didn't want to leave you in that
[1:10:13] state he wanted to unite him to himself
[1:10:16] amen but he knew he had to kill that
[1:10:17] first nature to kill your first Union I
[1:10:20] trust I'm not
[1:10:22] speaking Chinese or something to you I
[1:10:24] trust it makes sense
[1:10:26] amen oh he it's more than just him dying
[1:10:29] for your
[1:10:31] sin he died in your place to kill that
[1:10:34] First Union because he wanted to be
[1:10:36] married to you Hallelujah and that's why
[1:10:40] now but then when you come now when you
[1:10:43] so well that was 2,000 years ago what
[1:10:45] about today you've got to find where he
[1:10:47] laid amen like Ruth did and say cover
[1:10:51] me Hallelujah because you believe it
[1:10:54] happened but now you say Lord I want to
[1:10:56] see it
[1:10:57] lived amen that that first Nature's dead
[1:11:00] I want to see that expressed in this
[1:11:03] body
[1:11:05] Hallelujah and so now only God as now
[1:11:10] just jumping back again only God could
[1:11:13] be the one that could be our
[1:11:15] Kinsmen amen no man could do it no
[1:11:18] Prophet could do it doesn't matter if
[1:11:20] they Liv the perfect life we're all born
[1:11:22] in sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[1:11:25] world speaking lies amen I want to say
[1:11:28] these things because brother BR speaks
[1:11:30] in perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:11:33] he says you have to
[1:11:34] master uh human
[1:11:37] ability and what that means is you have
[1:11:39] to master the fact you cannot do it in
[1:11:41] your own ability that's what that means
[1:11:44] you have to master just come to the
[1:11:46] realization I cannot do
[1:11:48] it and don't sit back and say well
[1:11:50] what's the point in trying the only
[1:11:52] thing you can do is just surrender and
[1:11:54] die yield yourself and if you can master
[1:11:57] that fact that it's not you that works
[1:11:59] it out how you're going to do it you
[1:12:01] just have to stay yielded and dead amen
[1:12:04] you got to master he says it's very
[1:12:06] important you got to master that fact
[1:12:08] that human ability cannot do you nothing
[1:12:10] no good amen he says that's why the
[1:12:13] church is church world has miserably
[1:12:15] failed why because they Ed their own
[1:12:17] human ability we're going to learn the
[1:12:18] Bible this is what we're going to do and
[1:12:21] they where's it gone amen but that's
[1:12:24] still comes upon us we have to master
[1:12:27] that fact it's not by power it's not by
[1:12:30] might but by thy but by my spirit sayith
[1:12:32] the Lord
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:38] so Jesus now so so in so in Revelations
[1:12:42] chapter 5 we won't read it but maybe go
[1:12:44] read it
[1:12:45] later but we have a picture now John's
[1:12:48] taken up into the
[1:12:49] eternities he sees a book in the right
[1:12:52] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[1:12:54] sealed
[1:12:56] amen and then there was a strong Angel
[1:12:58] proclaiming who's worthy to open the
[1:13:00] book and loose the seals and John wept
[1:13:02] because he saw no one was worthy amen
[1:13:05] all the prophets were there all the
[1:13:07] Believers were there down through time
[1:13:09] but there's no man because a man Adam
[1:13:13] with his eyes opened allowed sin to come
[1:13:15] into the world yeah so if a man lost
[1:13:19] eternal life then a man has to come to
[1:13:21] restore eternal life Hallelujah that's
[1:13:24] why we need to Kinsman we have a Kinsman
[1:13:27] Hallelujah and this said John WEP
[1:13:30] because he knew remember John was there
[1:13:32] at the
[1:13:33] crucifixion amen John was there standing
[1:13:36] at the foot of the cross because Jesus
[1:13:38] was there and he looked down and he said
[1:13:40] to Mary woman behold your son looking at
[1:13:43] John and John behold your mom amen so he
[1:13:47] says basically says John look after Mary
[1:13:49] so je so John was there looking at him
[1:13:52] on the cross
[1:13:53] dying and it and he went to the tomb
[1:13:56] after he rose and he wasn't there amen
[1:13:58] so so John knew that he died and he rose
[1:14:01] again he even preached about the blood
[1:14:03] he preached about the cross he preached
[1:14:05] about Redemption but then when he looked
[1:14:07] at this he says where is this one where
[1:14:10] is this
[1:14:11] Kinsman and he went much cuz he knew the
[1:14:15] whole Plan of Redemption broke if there
[1:14:17] was not a man who was worthy to come and
[1:14:19] take that book
[1:14:21] amen and then one of the elders says
[1:14:24] weep not because the Lon of the tribe of
[1:14:25] Judah has prevailed and he looked and he
[1:14:28] saw a lamb
[1:14:31] Hallelujah and then so now and then he
[1:14:35] rejoiced because the lamb came and he
[1:14:38] took the book and brother Ram say the
[1:14:40] most Sublime act in scripture he took
[1:14:43] that book and then everyone all the
[1:14:46] elders everything bowed down and they
[1:14:48] said worthy out thou because you have
[1:14:49] redeemed us back to God out of every
[1:14:52] Kindred nation and tongue amen so here
[1:14:56] it now I I just trust I wish I had the
[1:14:58] vocabulary but here is John John is
[1:15:01] already a Believer like Ruth has become
[1:15:04] a Believer remember Ruth said your God
[1:15:07] will be my God she became a Believer
[1:15:08] before she left Moab then she comes to
[1:15:11] then she comes now to boaz's field and
[1:15:14] then she comes to where Boaz laid
[1:15:17] down and then she's basically crying out
[1:15:20] redeem me I mean cover me with your
[1:15:23] skirt Redeem Me undo my first my first
[1:15:28] part of my life wipe it out I don't want
[1:15:30] to be a moobus and here's John he's
[1:15:33] standing here saying I don't see a man
[1:15:36] who can do it someone needs to do it
[1:15:38] he's basic I I'm not no I trust you
[1:15:41] don't think I'm making a big Quantum
[1:15:43] jump but here he is and he's crying out
[1:15:46] basically within himself there must be a
[1:15:49] man who can
[1:15:52] undo my first part of my life remember
[1:15:55] that book that's the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:59] your name is in that book this is the
[1:16:02] book amen remember it's all symbolic but
[1:16:05] you're part of that book I said last
[1:16:07] Sunday it's like Jesus now the lamb
[1:16:10] Jesus comes and claims you amen so what
[1:16:14] what Boaz had to do because remember
[1:16:15] brother bam he he parallels The Book of
[1:16:18] Ruth and the lamb taking the book he
[1:16:21] says it's actually the same act so now
[1:16:23] what Boaz does
[1:16:25] as he says everything he says now
[1:16:28] everything that you've asked I will do
[1:16:31] if the near Kinsman won't do it and then
[1:16:34] after that
[1:16:36] scripture
[1:16:38] um the last part of Chapter 3 of Ruth
[1:16:41] she goes back to
[1:16:43] Naomi and then Naomi says to her then
[1:16:46] said then said she sit still my daughter
[1:16:50] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:16:53] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:16:56] have finished the thing this day am me
[1:16:59] so now as I said the time where Ruth is
[1:17:01] doing everything now it's all Boaz and
[1:17:03] noi says just ru just rest so she made
[1:17:07] the appeal cover me with your skirt cuz
[1:17:09] you're near a Kinsman and then now Ruth
[1:17:12] I mean Bo stands up and begins to act on
[1:17:14] her behalf and she's just resting and
[1:17:16] then so John is there who's and and he
[1:17:20] was weeping cuz he didn't see anyone
[1:17:22] worthy all the prophets were there you
[1:17:24] were there cuz it's Eternal realm amen
[1:17:27] Moses was there Elijah was there John
[1:17:29] the Baptist was there Joseph was there
[1:17:31] who Abraham Isaac Jacob all the way down
[1:17:34] brother Brandon was there all the
[1:17:36] Believers were there but no but they
[1:17:39] were all we were all born by sex amen
[1:17:43] but one man was not born that way
[1:17:47] Hallelujah and it was God creating a
[1:17:50] body creating a sacrifice in the womb of
[1:17:54] Mary cuz you go look in the scripture he
[1:17:57] never calls Mary mother once he always
[1:18:00] says woman amen and you go look at the
[1:18:04] wording I'm pretty sure the the word
[1:18:07] mother and woman are two different
[1:18:10] words amen remember because he is the
[1:18:13] word he never brings an error so that's
[1:18:15] why he never because she wasn't
[1:18:17] naturally would say well she is the
[1:18:19] mother because she birthed him and
[1:18:21] raised him up but he called a woman
[1:18:24] because
[1:18:25] naturally they weren't related
[1:18:28] whatsoever
[1:18:30] amen and so John is there saying you
[1:18:34] know he was weeping because no one
[1:18:36] because because that's what he wants to
[1:18:37] see he wants to see what someone take
[1:18:39] the book he wants to see someone take
[1:18:41] the Lamb's Book of Life amen because our
[1:18:46] lives are recorded in a book amen just
[1:18:49] like Ruth's life was recorded in a book
[1:18:53] yep and so now but she is depending now
[1:18:56] upon Boaz to undo the first part of her
[1:19:00] life amen so so so put it this way when
[1:19:04] Ruth came to an age of accountability
[1:19:06] she was writing her
[1:19:07] life amen she made decisions now I'm
[1:19:10] going to do this now I want to do this
[1:19:12] oh look at these look at this Israelite
[1:19:14] family why have they left Israel oh now
[1:19:16] they're here oh he's he he's a handsome
[1:19:18] young guy and then you know they I'm
[1:19:19] want to get married yeah I'll marry you
[1:19:22] you know makes all these decisions
[1:19:24] but then there comes now a time in her
[1:19:26] life where it's actually Boaz is now
[1:19:29] saying now I'm going to write your life
[1:19:32] I'm going to rewrite your life look
[1:19:34] where you ended up now B wouldn't have
[1:19:36] said this to her basically Ruth's
[1:19:38] decisions even though it brought her
[1:19:40] into Israel but before that decision she
[1:19:42] became a widow amen she was outside the
[1:19:45] economy of God this was her decisions
[1:19:47] led her there until Nomi you know Nomi
[1:19:50] said I'm going back your God will be my
[1:19:52] God and so that's where where her life
[1:19:55] ended up as all God ordained sure but
[1:19:58] her decisions led her that way and but
[1:20:01] then now Boaz comes upon the scene and
[1:20:03] by him redeeming Naomi marrying Ruth he
[1:20:07] was actually taking her old book amen
[1:20:12] dropping it into the sea of God's
[1:20:14] forgetfulness Hallelujah and it came
[1:20:16] forth what it was meant to be Mrs Boaz
[1:20:19] of Bethlehem you understand so now when
[1:20:22] you come to an age of accountability
[1:20:24] there's a record in heaven and it begins
[1:20:27] writing everything you do think say
[1:20:29] whatever more but then now you come to a
[1:20:32] point in life and I trust if you haven't
[1:20:33] come to that point you need to come to
[1:20:35] that point where you say Lord I need all
[1:20:37] my sins washed away I want my first life
[1:20:41] eradicated amen and that's why you go
[1:20:44] find where he laid down and you lay down
[1:20:46] there then what's happening now Jesus
[1:20:48] says I'm going to take your take your
[1:20:50] take your book of life I'm going to put
[1:20:53] it in the blood of put it in my own
[1:20:54] blood Hallelujah and when it comes forth
[1:20:57] out of his blood it's not even there
[1:20:59] anymore it's in the sea of God's
[1:21:01] forgetfulness Hallelujah God doesn't
[1:21:04] remember it you should forget it amen
[1:21:07] all you need to remember is God
[1:21:08] delivered me god Set Me Free God healed
[1:21:11] me God restored me that's all you need
[1:21:13] to remember amen just remember that oh
[1:21:16] this person did this to me just forget
[1:21:18] it move
[1:21:21] on you know history is not always a good
[1:21:23] thing
[1:21:25] amen because many nations many groups of
[1:21:29] people are still bitter by things that
[1:21:31] happen to their fourbe fourbe fourbe and
[1:21:33] they live in the past and their whole
[1:21:36] life is affected by things they never
[1:21:38] did amen so just just forget about
[1:21:42] it amen am just move on with God amen
[1:21:46] amen oh it's hard no just just say Satan
[1:21:50] it's done I'm not doing this dance
[1:21:52] anymore
[1:21:55] amen amen so now Ruth so Boaz by taking
[1:22:00] Ruth and changing her nature is exactly
[1:22:04] well how'd she Chang her nature she
[1:22:05] wasn't known by her old way anymore
[1:22:07] she's identified with a whole different
[1:22:09] kind of Life Hallelujah and she could
[1:22:13] not go back to her old life because she
[1:22:15] was not that person anymore hallelujah
[1:22:19] amen and now the Lord by claiming you
[1:22:22] remember he died at Calvary that he
[1:22:24] would kill that first nature that you
[1:22:26] could be United to him amen that's why
[1:22:28] we can never be United to Creeds and
[1:22:30] dogmas of man amen we are not we're not
[1:22:33] United to a bunch of Doctrine we're
[1:22:35] United to a living God Amen and God knew
[1:22:38] you'd be born the way you were
[1:22:41] Hallelujah but that's why he died for
[1:22:43] you because he he knew and you was part
[1:22:47] of
[1:22:48] himself Hallelujah I may say these
[1:22:50] things every Sunday but just just enjoy
[1:22:52] it for what it is because you got
[1:22:54] recognize remember your position in
[1:22:57] Christ you must know in here you must
[1:22:59] know who you are you must know what he's
[1:23:01] made you and if you if you can recognize
[1:23:04] I'm a son and daughter of God I'm not in
[1:23:07] slavery I've been set free I've been
[1:23:09] restored to my former estate what I
[1:23:11] meant to be Hallelujah then you can
[1:23:14] really shake it in the devil's face amen
[1:23:16] amen because God wants you to know who
[1:23:18] you are in him amen that your old life
[1:23:21] your old nature what you used to be as
[1:23:23] he annihilated
[1:23:25] Hallelujah sure you still live in this
[1:23:27] body but I tell you what you have a life
[1:23:29] in you I trust you do that can overcome
[1:23:31] the desires of this flesh amen it could
[1:23:34] overcome the things you used to think
[1:23:36] about things you used to do amen you say
[1:23:40] well I'm struggling with something say
[1:23:41] God put a greater desire in me for you
[1:23:44] than that thing amen that's all you need
[1:23:47] don't say Lord don't you say I need to
[1:23:49] get rid of this no say Lord put a
[1:23:51] greater desire in me for you amen that
[1:23:54] is that is the great secret because if
[1:23:57] you love something you'll do it amen oh
[1:24:00] I just love to ice skate now I'd be
[1:24:03] there every day I enjoyed it it was
[1:24:04] awesome but you know what I mean if
[1:24:06] there's a passion if there's a drive if
[1:24:08] there's a love you'll do it amen it's
[1:24:11] not no I got to I got to go and do it
[1:24:13] it's such a weariness no if you love it
[1:24:16] why do people do crazy things they train
[1:24:18] they do all kinds of crazy things some
[1:24:20] people you know you admire them for it
[1:24:22] cuz they you know the determination
[1:24:24] everything do but but somebody say
[1:24:25] that's crazy because there's a love and
[1:24:28] a drive and a passion
[1:24:30] amen and so if you just just say Lord
[1:24:33] give me that because what does the devil
[1:24:35] try and do numb you down make you feel
[1:24:39] disinterested make you feel like
[1:24:40] everything's common you know because if
[1:24:42] you come to that place you say well I
[1:24:44] better find something else to
[1:24:46] do that's what he tries to do he tries
[1:24:48] to numb it down this is the problem with
[1:24:50] his age where you know everything's just
[1:24:51] trying to numb you you see the you see
[1:24:53] the mess in the world and all the
[1:24:55] terrible things that happened we're not
[1:24:57] shocked by it
[1:24:58] anymore
[1:25:00] amen and why that's because the devil
[1:25:03] wants to numb us down numb us down in
[1:25:05] our walk with
[1:25:07] God but you've got to
[1:25:10] understand God has taken you hello Ruth
[1:25:15] how are you doing
[1:25:16] today amen good
[1:25:19] Hallelujah such a ky answer but he's
[1:25:23] taking you
[1:25:27] amen remember we are not our own but
[1:25:30] his amen if you know who you are if you
[1:25:34] know who you belong to that changes
[1:25:37] everything
[1:25:40] Hallelujah now so in the breach
[1:25:43] message but the law required a kinsman
[1:25:46] redeemer and every man on Earth was born
[1:25:49] of a uh I was born of a sex now don't
[1:25:52] you see that's where it come from that's
[1:25:54] where sin started you see where it's at
[1:25:56] now there comes your seed of the serpent
[1:25:59] in see notice required a kinsman
[1:26:01] redeemer see John needed a
[1:26:03] Kinsman amen and the Redeemer kinsman
[1:26:06] redeemer must be born of the human race
[1:26:09] there that leaves us out on a limb but
[1:26:12] let me sound a trumpet to you the Virgin
[1:26:15] birth produced the product amen the
[1:26:18] Virgin birth produced our kinsman
[1:26:20] redeemer none other but the almighty God
[1:26:23] became Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the
[1:26:26] kenman Redeemer was met you see how God
[1:26:29] makes a requirement and there's nothing
[1:26:31] we can do but then Grace steps in and
[1:26:34] overshadows that law and produces the
[1:26:36] product amen oh when you get over home
[1:26:40] when I get my little cabin down there as
[1:26:41] brother Neville sings about when you all
[1:26:44] hear something down there one morning
[1:26:45] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[1:26:47] saved a wret like me you say you say
[1:26:49] praise God old brother Brandon made it
[1:26:51] here he is see oh yes it's Grace that
[1:26:53] taught my heart the fear it was Grace my
[1:26:55] fears relieved how true that is
[1:26:58] hallelujah how precious did that Grace
[1:27:01] appear the hour I first believed wait
[1:27:03] till you get down there just in a moment
[1:27:05] oh my now we look The Book of Ruth gives
[1:27:07] us a beautiful picture of this amen
[1:27:10] because he pays for Ruth but then he
[1:27:12] marries Ruth amen and it's exactly what
[1:27:15] he did for you he died for you but now
[1:27:18] in on this day he comes to claim you
[1:27:20] Hallelujah that now he's going to unite
[1:27:22] himself with you that's what the this
[1:27:24] word does this is a this is a claiming
[1:27:26] word amen he said the bridegroom call
[1:27:28] will come right through this what's a
[1:27:30] bridegroom call the bridegrooms here go
[1:27:33] get married Hallelujah that's what the
[1:27:36] call is and he sends his word to prepare
[1:27:39] you Amen to become United with him
[1:27:43] Hallelujah and that's why you've got to
[1:27:45] understand if he's changed your
[1:27:47] nature Allelujah whose Nature's been
[1:27:50] changed amen you know there's a
[1:27:52] permanent you're not just living on you
[1:27:54] know there is amazing highs you know cuz
[1:27:58] it's cuz God brings emotion and
[1:28:00] something with emotion it's dead you
[1:28:02] should bury it and be born again amen
[1:28:05] but there's something you know
[1:28:06] something's happened to you and know
[1:28:08] your heart is turned towards heaven and
[1:28:11] you love him with all your heart so it's
[1:28:13] not just all the word blesses me it's
[1:28:14] something and you says oh I love him
[1:28:16] because he first loved me Hallelujah and
[1:28:18] you can't shake that it's more than a
[1:28:20] feeling it's more than a Something's
[1:28:22] Happened to you what's that you've been
[1:28:24] United the word has United you to Christ
[1:28:28] Hallelujah so now what you used to be is
[1:28:30] being annihilated hallelujah
[1:28:33] hallelujah amen and it's a reality yes
[1:28:37] sir amen I remember the day I died and
[1:28:39] was born again I've never been the same
[1:28:44] hallelujah amen
[1:28:46] nowall our Boaz and Ruth uh sorry Ruth
[1:28:50] uh noi had lost the
[1:28:52] estate and he says this Boaz had to
[1:28:56] become a redeemer he was the only one
[1:28:58] that could he had to be a Kinsman a near
[1:29:00] Kinsman now I say Boaz could be the only
[1:29:03] one that could do it because out of Boaz
[1:29:05] and Ruth came came David came Jesse OB
[1:29:09] Jesse David amen so there wasn't I'll
[1:29:12] say in the near the because it says in
[1:29:15] the book of
[1:29:16] Hebrews that Levi was an Abraham when
[1:29:20] Abraham paid ties to
[1:29:22] mzc yeah he says he was in there not
[1:29:25] figuratively Levi was in a was in the
[1:29:28] loins of Abraham great great grandfather
[1:29:30] whatever it was amen so now when so in
[1:29:36] Boaz was Jesse in Boaz uh forget I'm
[1:29:41] stretching it too far but but in Boaz
[1:29:43] was David he wasn't in the other one
[1:29:47] that David wasn't in the other Kinsmen
[1:29:49] he had to come through Boaz you
[1:29:52] understand and it so but but now the
[1:29:55] beautiful thing about Abra Levi being in
[1:29:57] Abraham when Abraham paid T to meis now
[1:30:00] is that was attributed to Levi I'm
[1:30:03] probably going down a rabbit hole but
[1:30:04] it's a glorious one now you got to
[1:30:06] understand that Jesus now you were in
[1:30:09] Christ when he went to Calvary amen
[1:30:12] because you are part of him you're part
[1:30:14] of his word and here's the fullness of
[1:30:16] that word the fullness of God a b was in
[1:30:18] him amen and he went to Calvary the word
[1:30:21] was made flesh and went to Calvary and
[1:30:23] you if you're part of the word you're
[1:30:25] part of them back there Hallelujah so
[1:30:28] now Levi was not conscious of when
[1:30:30] Abraham paid T to malisic but was
[1:30:33] attributed to him you following me you
[1:30:35] were not conscious when Jesus went to
[1:30:38] Calvary and died for you but because
[1:30:40] you're in him there amen his death is
[1:30:42] attributed to you Hallelujah him taking
[1:30:45] your sin upon his shoulders of Calvary
[1:30:47] is attributed to you Hallelujah and that
[1:30:50] oh well how do you know that well what's
[1:30:52] it happened what's it caused you to you
[1:30:54] what's what's happened to you amen
[1:30:57] because you see when he died he
[1:30:59] eradicated
[1:31:01] sin he he crucified your first nature he
[1:31:05] released an overcoming power to live
[1:31:07] above sin hell death in the grave he put
[1:31:10] Satan under your feet amen he put the
[1:31:13] device of this world under your feet he
[1:31:15] put everything the enemy has devised no
[1:31:17] weapon you know it says let's just go to
[1:31:20] Ephesians I'm just wanting to read the
[1:31:21] scripture let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:31:23] 3 I believe it is
[1:31:25] I want to read this real
[1:31:32] quick sorry it's um it's Ephesians
[1:31:36] chapter
[1:31:37] 5 the enemy comes
[1:31:40] in this is my instruction to
[1:31:43] you this is Paul's instruction or rather
[1:31:46] I'd say it's God's
[1:31:48] instruction he says in verse
[1:31:50] 19 speaking to yourselves
[1:31:54] in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:31:58] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:32:01] to the Lord giving thanks always for all
[1:32:04] things unto God and the father in the
[1:32:06] name of our Lord Jesus
[1:32:09] Christ so when the enemy comes
[1:32:12] in and things begin to snowball in your
[1:32:16] mind what do you Calla to do God is
[1:32:19] telling us through the book of Ephesians
[1:32:21] don't think on those things cuz those
[1:32:24] things will lead you to stress anxiety
[1:32:25] and ruin amen but think upon speaking to
[1:32:29] yourself this is what he says you're to
[1:32:31] consciously you want to defeat the enemy
[1:32:33] in your life amen speak to yourself in
[1:32:37] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:32:40] singing making melody in your hearts to
[1:32:42] the Lord why Psalms and hymns and
[1:32:45] spiritual songs is because the right
[1:32:46] music brings the presence of God
[1:32:49] hallelujah that and that's how the
[1:32:51] anointing comes down and breaks the Yol
[1:32:54] you say well you're just trying to force
[1:32:55] it out maybe at first but then but then
[1:32:57] you get into the swing of it then you
[1:32:59] begin to sing and then you say what was
[1:33:01] I so worried about in the first
[1:33:03] place amen always keep down that road
[1:33:06] and you'll do well worrying about
[1:33:09] tomorrow and problems will do you no
[1:33:11] good amen pray about it but you should
[1:33:14] pray I can't remember who said it
[1:33:16] yesterday don't worry about the problem
[1:33:19] praise God that he's greater than the
[1:33:20] problem forgive me if I get that wrong
[1:33:22] but you know you should always just
[1:33:23] focus delight yourself in the
[1:33:26] Lord amen yeah you got just I don't know
[1:33:31] just but inscribe that scripture into
[1:33:33] your soul and say Lord whenever the
[1:33:35] enemy comes in and things go wrong cause
[1:33:38] me to do this
[1:33:41] Hallelujah now that's what we must do
[1:33:45] and so now our
[1:33:48] Kinsmen our Kinsman has
[1:33:51] come in order
[1:33:54] so yeah that's where I was now the
[1:33:57] reason he died our said was for us to
[1:33:59] overcome everything of the enemy amen
[1:34:02] and we know it's attributed to us
[1:34:04] because it's manifested in
[1:34:06] you amen that's how you know how do I
[1:34:09] know he died for me because I see the
[1:34:12] victory that he won at Calvary
[1:34:13] manifested in this flesh Hallelujah
[1:34:17] that's how we know hallelujah it's just
[1:34:20] like Levi why was it attributed to Levi
[1:34:24] when he wasn't conscious of it because
[1:34:25] it was manifested later on where where
[1:34:27] the law said they shouldn't pay do you
[1:34:29] know they have no inheritance among you
[1:34:31] and all these things because that was
[1:34:33] because Levi was an
[1:34:35] Abraham amen and it was attributed to
[1:34:39] him when he paid tithes same when Jesus
[1:34:42] you're in Jesus that's why many you know
[1:34:45] why do we what how do we live this
[1:34:47] Christian life it's so simple why why do
[1:34:50] we live a Victorious Life oh there's ups
[1:34:52] and downs and hard ship and stress and
[1:34:54] trial there's of course there's those
[1:34:56] things I mean God just you know God just
[1:34:59] doesn't Force us through a pipe and now
[1:35:00] we overcome everything amen there's
[1:35:03] there's things you must overcome amen
[1:35:06] but you're anointed for
[1:35:07] victory amen you got to understand that
[1:35:10] and that's why that's why we should
[1:35:12] never you know but that's why why do we
[1:35:15] seeall why do we see New Birth why do we
[1:35:18] see people be born again why do we see
[1:35:20] the very divine nature of God come into
[1:35:23] people
[1:35:24] because Calvary is attributed to them
[1:35:26] because they were in Jesus when he
[1:35:29] died
[1:35:31] Hallelujah put that on your
[1:35:33] fridge amen so
[1:35:37] now so Boaz had to become a redeemer now
[1:35:41] I'm going to wind this up soon and he
[1:35:42] was the only one that
[1:35:44] could then Jesus Bo typ in Christ and
[1:35:48] when he redeemed Israel he got the
[1:35:49] Gentile bride Boaz redeemed Naomi and
[1:35:53] her land but he did that in order to
[1:35:56] marry Ruth amen so when Jesus died on
[1:35:59] the cross he redeemed Israel but he was
[1:36:01] doing that to get you
[1:36:04] Hallelujah so very
[1:36:06] beautiful he says he says we have it on
[1:36:09] tape somewhere said now notice he must
[1:36:11] be a Kinsman you see an angel couldn't
[1:36:13] do it a man couldn't do it it must be a
[1:36:14] man but he couldn't be born of a woman a
[1:36:18] sex act so the Virgin birth the Holy
[1:36:20] Spirit overshadowed Mary therefore Jesus
[1:36:22] was not a Jew Jesus was not a gentile
[1:36:24] Jesus was God that's exactly his blood
[1:36:27] didn't come from any sex act he was the
[1:36:29] Holy created blood of God and we're not
[1:36:32] saved by Jewish blood neither we saved
[1:36:33] by Gentile blood we're saved by the
[1:36:35] blood of God that's according to the
[1:36:38] Bible because Paul himself says you be
[1:36:40] overseers of the flock uh that's you by
[1:36:43] the that's been given by the Holy Ghost
[1:36:46] whose blood was shed for us
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] now we're saved by the blood of God
[1:36:54] that's according to the Bible it says so
[1:36:56] we're saved you see Jesus was God he was
[1:36:58] not a third person a fourth person
[1:37:00] second person he was the person he was
[1:37:02] God he was God Emanuel God came down
[1:37:04] from his glory revealed himself that's
[1:37:07] the one met the requirement Grace
[1:37:09] produced the person of Jesus Christ and
[1:37:12] we find this book now God stretched his
[1:37:14] tent came from God to become a man he
[1:37:17] changed his strain from Almighty to be a
[1:37:19] man to take on the form of man so he
[1:37:21] could die to redeem man wait till we see
[1:37:24] him again when there's nobody worthy all
[1:37:27] right in the Bible in the Book of Ruth
[1:37:28] as you read it you'll find such a person
[1:37:31] who is called a go a g o e l was called
[1:37:35] a goal however you say it it was a
[1:37:37] person that could meet the requirement
[1:37:39] and the
[1:37:40] goal must be able to do it must be
[1:37:43] willing to do it must be a Kinsman next
[1:37:45] Kinsman to do it and God the creator of
[1:37:48] spirit became king kin folks to us when
[1:37:51] he became a man in order he could take
[1:37:53] our sins upon him and pay the price and
[1:37:56] redeem us back to God again there it is
[1:37:58] there is the
[1:38:00] Redeemer
[1:38:03] amen and that's what Jesus
[1:38:06] did you say well he died 2,000 years
[1:38:11] ago the god that is alive Jesus Christ
[1:38:14] the same yesterday today and
[1:38:16] forever amen so he is still our
[1:38:20] Kinsman amen he is still our Kinsman
[1:38:24] Redeemer but I want to just give an
[1:38:27] invitation you need to lie down you need
[1:38:30] to Mark the place you laid down and need
[1:38:33] to lie down at his feet if you want
[1:38:36] Jesus to work on your behalf you got to
[1:38:38] Mark the place you laid and you got to
[1:38:41] go lay down at his feet and then you
[1:38:43] become his
[1:38:45] responsibility amen many times we make
[1:38:48] our walk with God our
[1:38:51] responsibility it's not that way
[1:38:54] if you've laid down at his feet I trust
[1:38:56] you have amen then you are his
[1:39:00] responsibility amen you come under his
[1:39:05] headship you and if you are his
[1:39:08] responsibity I mean responsibility all
[1:39:10] of the pressure and the you know all of
[1:39:14] the consequences and the pressure and
[1:39:15] what could happen lay upon his shoulder
[1:39:19] it's not upon you it's upon Him amen
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:24] oh am I going to make the Rapture it's
[1:39:26] his responsibility because I marked
[1:39:29] where he laid down and I laid down at
[1:39:30] his feet and I said redeem me oh God
[1:39:34] you're a near Kinsman to me Hallelujah
[1:39:37] and then he and then he acted on my my
[1:39:39] behalf because I'm a new creation I'm a
[1:39:42] brand new man so therefore I'm under his
[1:39:45] headship and it's his responsibility to
[1:39:47] get me there amen but outside of that
[1:39:51] you can do all you want and you get a
[1:39:54] thing amen unless you're willing young
[1:39:57] and old to lay at his feet and die amen
[1:40:00] you're outside of his responsibility oh
[1:40:03] but he knows the end from the
[1:40:05] beginning don't lean I lean on
[1:40:08] predestination now because I know I'm
[1:40:09] predestinated because I know I met God
[1:40:12] Amen so don't just say well what will be
[1:40:15] will
[1:40:16] be don't lean on that too much amen say
[1:40:21] Lord I've I've decided I'm I'm following
[1:40:23] you I'm following Jesus I'm going all
[1:40:27] the way amen and I and I I have a choice
[1:40:32] every day and I want to live for you
[1:40:35] amen because of Ruth remember I said
[1:40:39] probably I don't think it's too many
[1:40:40] times but I probably say it every Sunday
[1:40:42] God is a
[1:40:43] gentleman you can't he can't force you
[1:40:47] to become a Believer neither can we
[1:40:49] force anyone amen you have to make your
[1:40:53] own conscious Choice Ruth had to make a
[1:40:57] choice wherever you go know me I'm going
[1:41:00] doesn't matter what people say and then
[1:41:03] n says find out where he lies down mark
[1:41:05] it down lay at his feet all you have
[1:41:07] said I'll do she had to yield herself to
[1:41:09] the word that was instructing her amen
[1:41:13] because
[1:41:14] Naomi's in mind she wasn't trying to
[1:41:16] humiliate Ruth or I mean yeah she wasn't
[1:41:19] trying to humiliate Ruth she wanted Ruth
[1:41:21] to be married to Bo
[1:41:24] amen but to the caral mind it seemed
[1:41:27] ridiculous and to be a believer to the
[1:41:30] carnal mind seems ridiculous oh you're
[1:41:32] Overboard you're just crazy you just got
[1:41:34] too much religion you're just too
[1:41:36] serious amen I I agree Hallelujah I'd
[1:41:40] rather be in the deep end where I'm
[1:41:42] totally covered you know if you jump
[1:41:44] into deep water you may drown but you
[1:41:47] won't break your neck you jump into
[1:41:49] shallow water you will break your neck
[1:41:52] amen amen and if you jump into Christ
[1:41:55] you don't
[1:41:56] drown amen this water you cannot drown
[1:42:00] amen so I'd rather be oh you you know
[1:42:03] you know I've been told years ago oh you
[1:42:04] just jumped in the deep end so praise
[1:42:07] God Amen praise the Lord because the
[1:42:10] water's
[1:42:11] good but you got to understand if you do
[1:42:14] not lay down at his feet amen then he
[1:42:18] cannot act on your
[1:42:19] behalf amen it's really that simple
[1:42:23] am mean we have some musicians to
[1:42:25] come but on the other side of that if
[1:42:28] you
[1:42:29] do then he's responsible for
[1:42:32] you
[1:42:34] amen and he's responsible for the
[1:42:37] restoration of you and your
[1:42:40] family
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:44] amen and so if that's the
[1:42:48] case then I'd rather lay down at his
[1:42:51] feet well I'm a good person I've done
[1:42:53] nothing wrong the Rich Young Ruler
[1:42:55] didn't do anything wrong but he wasn't
[1:42:57] willing to lay down where he you know he
[1:43:00] wasn't willing to lay down his life take
[1:43:01] up his cross and follow him amen and he
[1:43:04] ended up he didn't end up in
[1:43:06] heaven
[1:43:08] amen and the problem is if you compare
[1:43:12] yourself with someone else you won't be
[1:43:14] in heaven that's right oh look but I'm
[1:43:17] better than this I'm better than brother
[1:43:18] so and so sister so and so forget it
[1:43:23] how Lord how do I compare with
[1:43:26] you amen because if you keep your focus
[1:43:29] if you keep your focus on the Lord
[1:43:32] you'll come out
[1:43:33] right amen because this is not keeping
[1:43:36] up with the
[1:43:37] Joneses amen oh but I've been a good
[1:43:41] Christian all my life what about
[1:43:43] now amen because because normally people
[1:43:46] say that they're actually in their mind
[1:43:47] comparing themselves with other people
[1:43:48] they
[1:43:49] know
[1:43:51] amen don't don't don't worry about those
[1:43:53] things I say have you laid your life
[1:43:55] down have you laid down at his feet amen
[1:43:59] because it's between you and God doesn't
[1:44:01] matter doesn't matter what everyone else
[1:44:03] is doing what have you
[1:44:05] done
[1:44:07] amen amen let's just sing that song
