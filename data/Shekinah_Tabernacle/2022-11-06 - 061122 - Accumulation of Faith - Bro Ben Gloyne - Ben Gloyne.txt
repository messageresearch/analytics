the Lord amen see if I'm all relaxed just let the tension go tomorrow take care of itself God's greater than your problems he is the solution to every problem why uh your man's been trying to fix themselves and each other for since the fall and look where it's heading in nuclear war doesn't mean to rhyme that but you know what I mean like it's gonna so let's just let God be the fixer amen but uh Esther chapter nine and we're gonna read from verse 20 down to um verse uh 30. it's gonna read ten verses here so it's easier an Esther 9 and 20 and Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of King hazardous both nine far to establish this among them that they should keep the 14th day of the month of ADA of the 15th day of the same yearly as the days that wherein the Jews rested from their enemies and and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to Joy from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and ascending of portions one to another and gifts to the poor and the Jews undertook to do all um as they had begun and as Mordecai had written unto them because Haman the son of hamadatha the agar guide the enemy of all the Jews had devised against the Jews to destroy them and to cast per that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them but when Esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his Wicked device which he devised against the Jews should return upon his his own head and that he and his son should be hanged on The Gallows wherefore they called These Days Purim after the name of purr therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them the Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail and they should keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every Province every city and that these days of pyrams should not fail from among the Jews nor the memorial of them perish from their sea then Esther the Queen the daughter of Abigail the and Mordecai the Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim and he sent the letters unto all the Jews to the 120 and seven provinces of the kingdom of a hazarus with words of peace and Truth Glory praise God Amen let's just bow heads in the word of prayer this morning gracious father Lord we want to bless your name today Lord that's why we've gathered together that your name which is the name above all names will be lifted on high Lord that you'll be exalted Lord unto the position that is worthy of your deeds and your love Lord and your mercy and your grace Lord we thank you Lord you have done great things and are doing great things in our midst my God we thank you we could read your word Lord we thank you Lord it's not just a history book it's a Living Word and father I pray you take it by your Holy Spirit anchor it into our hearts oh God may bring forth a hundredfold lord we sometimes sing that song word of God changing me changing you Lord we just pray father your word would change us today from glory to glory dear God I pray you would just remove every part of us Lord or every part in this Lord that's not of you Lord and may you just receive all honor glory and praise today may you increase our faith dear God and Father may you also be the portion of those who couldn't be here this morning Lord I pray you'd anoint them and keep them o God and Father visit them in a mighty way as well we love you Lord we thank you we can commit our lives and every need every burden every question on our hearts unto you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning praise the Lord I want to um I was going to speak on something else but I um went to the supermarket last night and I um it's kind of whole swung around you know seeing that we live in an hour or we live in a day where um you know we celebrated or the world or celebrated Guy Fawkes now Guy Fawkes you know many people just think it's a time to get some uh you know fireworks and fire them off and scare the pets and you know do that kind of thing but the but the but the Guy Fawkes has come from from a celebration of of when um when the uh Catholics tried to blow up the House of Lords there in England this is in 16 uh 05 they tried to do it because at that time King James was on the throne he's a Pros Protestant King and they wanted to blow up the House of Lords and blow up Herman you know reinstall a Catholic uh monarchy there but it was a failed plot it was exposed and the day before because the House of Lords was uh going to convene on the 5th of November and on the 4th of November that night the plot was exposed and Guy Fawkes was one of the conspirators and he was guarding all the gunpowder under the House of Lords and they found the others and and anyway it's a celebration every year of a commemoration of a victory over over a defeated foe now if we look into this uh this this Feast of Purim we know we do not celebrate it as the Jews do because you know we're not Jewish but it is it is a feast or a celebration of when a foiled plot of the enemy Was Defeated now we we should just Rejoice because you know we live in in a feast of Victory today amen where our enemy has been defeated he has been exposed he's been vanquished he's been conquered and you know we can Rejoice because if if God conquered him there then the victory he won there will manifest here right so we can Rejoice that you know you know we can have our Feast of Purim every day praise the Lord because our enemy has been defeated you know uh I believe that the reason that the uh Gunpowder Plot failed is because the King James Bible had to be had to be published it would begin to be um you know uh but yeah before this time it was um you know King James instituted or or said about the having the bible translated and was finally released in 1611 so to me uh you know the reason is because we had to have the word as we do in this day and I believe it's a good enough translation of the Angel of the Lord would would direct brother Branham to it I think it's a good translation don't you amen and it's and it stood the test of time so you know so we see that the Jews they still celebrate the Feast of Purim because it reminds them of the Unseen hand of God turning certain death into Victory and we can do this but in a far greater measure praise the Lord amen we can do this in a far greater measure because this wasn't just a plot to destroy our natural lives but was to destroy us in our entirety where we would be cast out into into Everlasting destruction and be consumed in hell but God rich and mercy intervened amen I want to thank the Lord that before the devil ever devised Us in his in his heart he had already made a way to undo what the devil is doing now if we look at the Feast of pure and what I love about this is is before Haman ever came to his position a queen was already ordained called set in position the crown was already on her head if you read through the Book of Esther Esther came to her position then Haman came to his position and we know the devil is always late he's habitually late he turns up too late amen he's always over budget you know running you know way too late you know his time frames always gone and you know he's always late but God is always on time we may think God's timing is not good timing but God's timings always perfect timing maybe it's a weekend rest assured that God is on time amen so the queen was already in her position now you think about the power that this woman possessed she came out of nowhere it's amazing how we can let our past derail our current walk but Esther would not allow her being herself being an Orford or I mean orphan living in a Strange Land having to actually deny her name to take on a a Persian name she did not let this hold her back for when the time had come for her to take her god-given rights and take her position she stepped forth and it was her she you know no one else could do the job like she could do the job sure Mordecai would say that you know if you do not go Deliverance or rice from another place but perhaps you've come into the kingdom for a Time such as this and it's the same thing with you and I there's a reason you've come into the kingdom this morning there's a reason you've come in this season amen not another season but this season where there's a culmination of the ages is here all things are here right now where the manifestation of the third pull is in full manifestation right now you've come into this Kingdom for a Time such as this amen where the enemy would be thoroughly defeated where his plans and his schemes and his plus to trap the seed of God in this age amen we'll be do we'll be absolutely defeated and we'll March out of here victorious in a Rapture I'm man Hayman schemed a lot no doubt it would be passed down through his family line of the of the wars of the Jews against the amalekites which he came from and King ahag which he came from being killed in if I'm going too fast just just okay just say slow down a bit you know but you know those things were passed down and he thought finally is the opportunity I can right the wrongs of my people so he schemed and you know the devil finally thinks he's got us he thinks he's trapped us here in this world with all the amusements and shiny things of the world and being born in unbelief and you know born born under a curse anyway who think he's got the human race but he doesn't have the human race he does not have Adam's Fallen race because our God step forth from the portals of Glory became one of us they mean to take upon the seed of Adam Amen to take upon human flesh to redeem us back to himself amen but Esther had to stand in her position it was no good her sitting in the palace saying I'm the queen she had to exercise her god-given office remember it wasn't herself that decided I'm going to be Queen no she just found herself in a current of events that that somehow you know the you know the decree she didn't say she didn't get vashti too you know reject the king's orders and be you know exiled whatever she didn't plot that she didn't scheme any of those things but she just found herself caught up in this Vortex of events and then she finds herself being summoned to the palace and she finds herself finding favor with hair guys she finds herself reasoning in a different reasoning than the other woman where she said haggai what should I wear to go before the king you seem to know the king more than I ever could and it's the same thing with us where where we've come into this age and God has sent a haggai in this day the seventh angel messenger who knows the heart of the king and there's something in it says says Lord what should I get dressed in and we approach the word and we don't come to God according to what we want we come to God according to what he wants amen and this is and Aang and we are a woman of Grace right well we do not approach God according to what we think we should do and I think I'll dress this way I don't care what it goes it doesn't matter all those things no we come and say Lord how can I live that's pleasing unto you not that we're trying to earn heaven but because of what he's done for us it's out of appreciation Lord you're so good I was in darkness and you found me I was lost and blind and you opened my eyes and I wasn't looking for you but you were looking for me and you found me and now Lord how can I live in a way that will please you because of what you have done amen so so Esther went and she spoke to haggis because haggar knew the heart of the king and so then he said you know she he said well this is how you should dress this is how you should be baptized there's not three kings there's one king this is how you should dress this is how you should conduct yourself this is how you should treat your brothers and sisters just how you should treat your family this is how you should do these things and you know she just dressed in it Hallelujah and then she goes them before the king and maybe there were a lot of other women who went before her who who who had the had the lineage you had the reputation of being a you know being being of royalty and having a church history which is better and greater whatever more but they didn't know the heart of the king they just knew the heart of their movement amen so she went in before the king and she found favor in his sight Hallelujah and then she finds herself kneeling before him I don't know how the ceremony exactly went but but the Royal Crown was placed upon her head and she found herself being the queen of Persia of the meats and Persians the superpower of the age she was the queen Hallelujah but it wasn't her schemes that got her there it was she was applauding nothing it was God's foreordained grace because he knew she when she got into that position that she was going to be used to defeat the devil's work praise a lot it's the same thing with you and I you know it's amazing how God would allow the fall to happen and he would allow us to actually be born in unbelief and you know and these lips that would speak cursing and blasphemy and mockery this life that that that the devil would actually be allowed to use to to to just be a mockery of you make a fallen people but then God would come and by the bleach of his blood not just wash our sins away but change our nature where it went from unbelief into faith if you're a Believer this morning you've been changed amen you've been God's son of work in your heart Hallelujah and then to the same lips that actually exalted the kingdom of Hell upon the Earth and now the same lips that tear the kingdom have held down holy where God could use your lips and cast out demons and could bring healing and could bring deliverance and could bring comfort and understanding where once maybe God would I mean I mean the devil would would actually anoint you to tear down and to rip apart and to break down God uses those same lips to build up and to edify and bring healing and love to one another amen hallelujah we're anointed to tear the kingdom of Satan down but you see Esther had to step into that position it wasn't enough for it just to be Queen like I've said but she had to use the office that God had placed her in amen you know it's amazing you know I really want this morning to be a accumulation of faith you know brother bam says this this is from thy house I think it's a very striking statement now he says now if you're sick here's healing you just believe it now you can't make yourself believe it's going it's got to be something happen to you just like your conversion has got to happen he says I was telling my wife the other day how much I loved her so I don't guess she wants me to talk about this but I do it in private so I guess I can do it in public right now pardon me I was telling you how much I loved her and how I always loved her since the The First beginning Amy I said I don't it don't make any difference she said oh Bill she said oh talking about how fat she was getting and her hair was turning gray I said honey you could be that way to know here I'd still love you just the same see because it has to be something there that uh that you have you have to meet that you love somebody and unless that person loves that other person this is for you young girls that are not married to your boys when you meet that girl that you love and there's just something you know you love her and that's just all there is to it or you love him and you don't care whether he's handsome whether he's not handsome or whether she's pretty or not pretty it doesn't matter but you love them just the same they better watch kind of hold around close there because we're getting close to home and a marriage based outside of that is sure to fall it'll never be successful they'll never be happy now I said that it's going to get around to one thing I want to say friends a conversion outside of the same thing won't last either it won't when you go to church and you say well I'm going to church I'm going to be baptized if it isn't coming from a heart of love to God Yonder it'll go nowhere all you'll do is just join church and be baptized but when you're converted to Christ I love to Christ then you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would do for your wife or for your husband you accumulate a faith that you walk in that fight I don't see it's just something about you you've got something that anchors you there you see well it's the same way it is about Christ and what Christ says you believe it you just stay right with it that's the way it just raises you right up above it and God brings it to pass and fulfills his promise that thou will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thine in thy house shall be saved so it's an accumulation of facing see a conversion outside of a coming to God with a heart of love and a change of nature it won't last see we don't just want to join church and get baptized and say the same kind of way we're going to see a difference in our lives you know the word should be working mildly in us to changing our Natures changing our hearts and you see but when you come when you converted to Christ you get a love to Christ then you accumulate the faith in Christ you begin to gather faith amen amen and that's why I believe we should do when we should you know you know when we come to church when we read the word when we pray when we hear the message we're actually accumulating Faith you're Gathering it you're collecting faith building your faith Bank up amen amen because we're going to look at now if we could look at the victories that the Lord has won in the past amen and in our lives and see that by faith that God if God has given the first Victory then he'll give the next Victory and if he's promised and fulfilled the first promise he will fulfill every promise and ought to accumulate a faith in you and I that he's more than able to do that which he has promised hallelujah amen that's you know that's how we should be we come to accumulate faith and we can accumulate Faith from every Divine promise in the scripture we can see every type and Shadow that we're here to fulfill it we should accumulate Faith through them amen to you and see Esther now she no doubt she was you know it's a strange thing that she was fearful to God to the prince of the king in the great hour of need where Haman had written the law that you know all the Jews were going to die of the 12th I mean 13th day the 12th month you know that was Laura you know in the kingdom and in this great hour where she could go in and get access to the king like no one else could she was afraid to do so but you know you really think about the you know the the position she was in the crown was given to her the crown that she put on was given to her by the king the robes that she put on were given to her by the king it wasn't her own robes these were these were given to her amen amen they you know the you know the shoe she put on they were given to her by the king you know so she had to you know put those things on now you think about you and I this crown of Grace that's been given to us God gave it to you God gave it to you he put it on your head the Rope of his righteousness that you wear the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word he gave it to you amen he is or die ordained that you should be a raid and fine linen and clean and white I meant to be to be shot with the gospel preparation of Peace of the Gospel he gave you that I mean so so he's he's a raid you to go into his presence you know you think about how great it is in this hour the reality of justification see all these things should accumulate Faith now Martin Luther would preach to Josh shall live by faith we're justified by our faith but true justification is not just a forgiveness it's a inevited in the first place that's the kind of justification that you know we live under now you've got to think about now where where is the first place now the first place before there is anything upon the Earth anything in existence was in God's mind so when God thought of you he saw you just like he said about Joby asked job where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth and the morning Stars sang For Joy and shouted and he's trying to get job to see job you were with me when I did those things you were shouting you're rejoicing job I didn't see you in my mind on an ashy this is not your final destination you're just passing through this Trail because I want to show you the resurrection but when it all is said and done what I thought of you in the beginning you're going to be in the End Amen so when he thought of you he didn't see you in your sins and your struggles and your trials and your troubles and your past and your burdens he didn't see you like anything be shouting and rejoicing and worshiping around the throne amen so that's why we say we never did it in the first place that's how God thought of us you think about sanctification now the methodists would say there's a method to being sanctified where where they lived the holy life out of their own human effort to be sanctified people and you know God worked on that but true sanctification is not us trying to cleanse ourselves right but a true sanctification is when the blood comes and cleanses our desires cleanses those things the world from us that there's nothing in us that wants it anymore that's a true sanctification amen Hallelujah now then you take the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Pentecost will say well they've got gifts and they've been anointed therefore they have it but the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is that on the day of Pentecost where God came and didn't dwelt his people and then walked in them talked to them acted through them manifested his word through their lives I bet you think shouldn't that accumulate faith in our hearts I've been Justified Hallelujah I never did it in the first place I've been Sanctified amen all the desires for the world are gone where'd they go I don't know but I don't want them back they're not boomerangs they're gone Hallelujah I've been filled with the spirit of God all that God is he's poured into the church he's poured into you and I amen now I'm a living Tabernacle of the Living God hallelujah shouldn't that accumulate Faith but but why did he do that it's because we're part of this amen is a prophecy of a bride that's being laying on the pages of the Bible amen and we just happen to be in the season because when God saw it when he would write in Revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and unto her be she should be a right and like fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints you know when John penned that he saw it in symbol form God thought of you God thought of you because remember a prophecy must have someone to fulfill it it's not just put there and God says well you know it's not like some algorithm or some guesstimation where maybe someone will step into it and fulfill it it well that was close enough so therefore that must be the Fulfillment no that's not how it works that's not how it works when God speaks something he knows exactly who's going to fulfill it when it's going to be fulfilled and how it's going to be fulfilled so when we saw the marriage supper of the Lamb when that was when that was prophesied through John God thought of you amen hallelujah shouldn't that accumulate faith that I'm not just coming through to sing into a haphazard way or maybe you know stab in the dark but God ordained that you would hear his word that you respond to his word you'll become one with his word you'd manifest that word through your life Hallelujah and that's what God just like Esther Esther was ordained before she knew she was ordained she was called before she realized it and she was in a position but she had to step into that position and use it amen so she was afraid to go before the king because the law said none could come without being summoned but Grace always overshadows the law Hallelujah that's why when she walked into the king's presence he extended the scepter of Grace to her pardoning grace amen there's something else is I must go to the king I cannot stay in this position I can't stay with this death threat over me and my family I've got to go before the king the losses you can't but Grace said I provided a blood for you to come into my presence amen then extended a scepter of grace to you you touched the head of it and he says now what is your request that's amazing you're the king the main thing he seems to say and Esther to me is now what is your request what do you have need of today well you've come into my presence for a reason you've come to church for a reason what is your request today what's going on in your life remember you've got to speak it to him he knows all about it but you've got to voice it to him because he wants to have a relationship amen he wants to have a communion with you will you speak to him and he speaks back Amen to the king says no what is your request I'll give you even up to half my kingdom now that does not mean now God split the Persian Empire into two into sdu of the Eastern side I'll have the Western no that that's not what it means it actually means I'll make you co-ear with me I mean I'll be Co I'll make you join air and that's exactly what our Lord Has Done where it says that we are now joint is amen and if children let's go to Romans 8 and 15 for for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that's not the anointing we're under but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father or my father we know who our father is you know who your daddy is amen the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may also be glorified together so we're joint is now that word jointly a means a co-ear amen we are we are ears together so all that the Lord Jesus now remember he fell into all things all things old Power and Heaven and Earth is given to him right so so he conquered all things but he didn't want to just he didn't just purchase it for himself he wanted to enjoy the victory with his bride with his wife I mean so he now elevates Us by his own blood to be joining us with him police all that he fell here too we fall there too maybe not because we have done anything to Meredith no but because he fell into it and he wants to share it so he wants to share the victory he wants to share The Spoils of War he wants to share the Feast of his word he wants to share his presence with you and I that's what he wants to do I mean the word realize we're falling into every Divine promise every promise right now is yours in the scripture wouldn't that accumulate faith that's all that's all yours that's all yours right now or maybe one day no now right now it's yours Hallelujah so I'll make you join here amen so because he says what will thou Queen Esther what does I request that shall be given unto even half the kingdom now when she went in before the king she invited him to a banquet of wines no I know you know the story but let's just enjoy it today praise the Lord because we're having a feast of Purim every day I mean where the name of the devil's we're going to be blotted out under heaven and we're celebrating that day right now we need to be thrown to the Lake of Fire so if he was cast out of your life remember the first factories won the final Victory will be won where death will be no more hallelujah amen isn't that right so if we can we can Rejoice now because if this has happened that's gonna happen Hallelujah so she invited him and the enemy you think why would you invite your enemy but you know he sets the table before us at the Prince of our enemy God is not afraid to set a feast up for you with the devil in your presence he says just come eat you just come eat and fish sure he's there makers boasts whatever more but just eat on the word just enjoy his presence Hallelujah no I I you know I can do that too you know praise the Lord I don't have enough room we need to pick a church a banquet of wines no there's something that moves the heart of God it's it's real worship it's not a performance but a real heartfelt worship worship from the heart moves the heart of God Amen that's what we want to do that our lives would move as hard amen that he just hears us say thank you Lord a real thankful heart now it can be expressive it can be quiet but it's what the heart projects out amen as as really what matters you know you can be dancing the aisles you can have a tear run down your cheek but it can have the same effect right but but that moves the heart of God and so now the King was invited to this banquet of wines now we have the biggest wine banquet there's ever been in the history of man we have a seven seal we have a seven sealed menu we have a seven course menu of the word all of God remember Jeff remember the prophet said the the opening of these seals reveals Christ rice is not just horse riders and tribulation and the Jews and although it's Christ being revealed through all those seals right so it's Christ being real the word being revealed amen so we have the biggest banquet of wines we could ever have because amen Revelation causes a stimulation right so the oil is the Revelation the anointing comes down on the word anoints it to our hearts and then it stimulates us we act like drunk people we get excited Hallelujah that's why that's why you know we get here on Wednesday hearing brother Chris preach about the Queen of Sheba that's getting a bit drunk I was getting a bit happy well it was a revelation with anchoring praise the Lord just like at Camp getting a bit drunk yeah we're a bunch of happy drunk amen we're not we're not depressed drunks we're happy drunks because what happens is you know someone who's drunk the real them comes out the inhibitions go amen right so when you get drunk in the spirit of happiness comes out because that's who you really are you can be having a bad day you can feel down you can be depressed you can be troubled but when you get drunk in the spirit amen a happiness comes forth because that's the real you that's right Hallelujah so don't ever go by your feelings sure we all have bad days we have ups and downs we have trouble sometimes but that's not the real us that does not define you being a Christian you're a Christian because you took God in his word you came God's provided away you repented were baptized in his name filled with his holy ghost living according to his word that's what makes you a Christian because you can believe and receive the word that's what makes you a Christian not not better with reasoning but you can welcome and receive it amen hallelujah so so it moves the heart of the king now the king can't sleep after the first banquet he can't sleep he can't rest it's something stirring within him sure maybe before that he could sleep every night but now there's a time of action and now his memory's got to be stirred up so he calls for the for the records of the Kingdom to be read and finally it gets to the place where it would speak of when Mordecai would tell the king about the about the plot of a big thing and cherish you know trying to kill him and how Mordecai exposed the plot and then the king now asks well what did Mordecai receive what was his reward and the answer was well he received no reward that's right so now what happened is the where where what I love about it is God God loves to change the story Heyman no doubt was feeling very rested in himself even though he was angry and he couldn't well okay he was rest assured that on the 13th day of Adar the Jews are going to get wiped out it was law it was basically done he was just waiting for that time to come right but then and it's the same thing with the devil he thinks yeah I've got them there's no way they're ever going to meet God I've watered them off in their mind they've caught up in all kinds of things this is just how it is but then God always interrupts the devil's plans anyways interrupts the devil's plan he intercedes where we think there's no way it can be done God steps down that's why we always don't look at what you see but look at what you believe I mean take the word above what you see above what you hear above what you feel take the promise more than what you see amen so so the devil's plan was interrupted and it all began to change when the records came open amen so so when the book came open the records when the seals came off the book amen and the Scribe began to re read the history of the kingdom it was sealed in the records but now the book comes out the lamb steps forth and takes the book and opens the seals of it and then the history begins to be read then the king says no why wasn't he rewarded hallelujah what happened is now the fortunes are reversing the tables are being turned we live in a season where the tables have been turned against the enemy we are no longer under his feet but he's under Alfie amen we are no longer his slaves but he must do what we say Amen where he once used us to bring his kingdom forth now we God uses to tear his kingdom down Hallelujah so never ever diminish the fact God has loosed you from his clutches amen the best claws have been ripped off your life amen he's now a trophy on your wall and you stand Victorious Hallelujah do you believe that this morning hey man don't ever let the devil wrestle in your mind saying you're not an overcomer you're an overcomer he always tries to reclaim that which he was cast out from but I tell you we are not his property no one in this room or maybe listing here as his property I remember we're free Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah so when the book came open then then the fortunes of what was going on were totally reversed Hallelujah and then now then now the king rewarded Mordecai and his enemy had to pray them through the streets on the king's horse and the King's apparel with the crown of the king there and everything and then now now it was Haman was caught up in a whirlwind of events that it was totally out of his control you know this world is actually totally out of the devil's control God is supreme over all things right God is Supreme Over All Things We may think all the Devils controlling the world he has a he has a limitation of control that God has ordained and allowed him to do praise God nothing can happen in this world without God saying yes first you know the devil is the biggest lobbyist there is who knows what a lobbyist is they'll Lobby the government say you're pushing their agendas they have no Authority but they'll just they'll just they'll just get into the air of politicians and begin to whisper what they want and you know they're paid to do things and you know they Lobby the devil is the worst lobbyist there is well we're going to realize that he is the accuser of the brethren this is what his lobbying is all about to stand before God and to accuse us before God day and night outside that's what he does he accuses us but we've got to realize that actually he has no Authority no more you know where the devil will accuse will stand before God she did this and he did this and he said this and she did this and trying to pull up all of your past and use it against you but then the king actually goes into his records and says hold on but in my records which are perfect amen all there is against their name is a blank as a blank as a blank sheet hallelujah it's been eradicated by the blood of Jesus Christ it's all gone amen but he's a lobbyist see he will go before God and try and stop God's plans amen just like before we went to Canada you know the law was speaking to Christine about how the devil's trying to give you covert he's trying to stop your flights he's just trying to stop the trip but what are you asking and we know the story The Storm turned up too late we flew out and while we we just had a staycation when we got home let's praise the Lord yeah so yeah the devil's plans were defeated see so but you see now if if the devil's a lobbyist how much more you and I to go before the Throne of God to intercede for others to plead the blood over other people Amen to go before him because the devil wants to kill maimon destroy but now what should we do now because he's a full-time devil right we should be full-time believers amen so you see here that you're in you're in the Book of Job Satan would Lobby for job's life because the Lord would point out to the devil how great job is he's a perfect man right but but then the devil says here in Job 1 and 9 then Satan answered the Lord and said doth job fair God for naught Hast not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side that was bless the work of his hands and his substance has increased in the land put forth don't hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan and behold all that he hath is in my power on by may only upon himself put forth not thy hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord so you see now Satan had some limitations of what he could do but it's because he was lobbying God let me touch him let me get a hold of his life he only loves you because everything goes fine for him but God had confidence in job just like God has confidence in you amen that you know the devil go up and Lobby to try and get a hold of your life or or allow a trial or sickness or something to strike your family or to strike you but God has confidence in you not in your Humanity now but in the seed he put in your soul before the foundation of the world Amen to now just as God at confidence and job under the blood of bulls and ghosts how much more you and I under the blood of Jesus Christ and I knew I'm better Covenant than that right amen so Now esther was elevated into the position of Queen amen and she went into the prince of the king and now the King was moved by by the first banquet of wines and then now the records were yo yo I'm just reviewing quickly then the records came open and now the whole whole course of the Story begins to change when the word came open now it's the same thing in this hour the word has come open now the course of the story is changing because when the book comes open Revelation is 10 it's manifested then it said he said that time shall be no more and that word time shall be no more means there shall be no more delay I'm gonna wind up my plan I'm gonna gather my bride to myself the Jews are going to be in their Homeland I'm going to take her in a Rapture amen and then they are going to be revealed I'm going to reveal reveal myself to the Jews Hallelujah you got to think about now prophecy cannot be stopped no no prophecy cannot be stopped right the devil's tried to stop Prophecy from the Garden of Eden but he could not stop a single one amen he could Haman could not destroy the Jews because the Messiah had to come amen out of out of those people amen where where there would be a prophecy now of Balaam would speak in numbers 24 and I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel maybe so a ruler shall come Genesis 49 and 10 the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver from between his feet until shallow come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be there's prophecy now that a king would come out of Judah now Haman couldn't stop this happening amen no matter all the plans of the enemy it looked like that you know it was basically checkmate for the Jewish people here was a man an egg a God and a malachite the enemy of the Jews as prime minister of the whole you know superpower of the age you think it's done he's got in law they're going to die but he cannot stop prophecy being fulfilled yo your life could be back up against the wall right now you'd say it's absolutely impossible the devil's got me tied up and not my family and nuts we're done that's Checkmate I've got Yo I can't there's no I can't get out of this but God won't let it that way amen you got to realize that God's going to intervene on your behalf you are a bleep remember fear and worry will help no one faith will deliver that's why we've got to take God in his word amen just believe what he has said Hallelujah no I love it in Isaiah 9 and 6 run to us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hateful even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform us so the Zeal of God is going to make this happen amen now the in the Contemporary English version it says it like this where it says the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform it he says the Lord all-powerful will make certain that all of this is done oh this is the Lord all-powerful not just powerful all-powerful the almighty in other words will make certain that all of this is done now what is all this has done well all of this has done that Jesus Christ God would become flesh that he is supreme deity that he had sit on the throne of David in the Millennium now if he's going to sit on the throne in the Millennium he and he's going to be king then he's going to have to have subjects to rule over and not just that but he's going to have a queen amen the feminine part of himself that she reflects him will be there by his side Made In His Image now this is prophecy I just want to encourage you this morning we're living under prophecy amen and prophecy cannot be broken it cannot be stopped I mean if you're part of the word it cannot be stopped no matter how much the devil hinders how much he fights how many questions he bombards you with troubles he gives you remember prophecy will be fulfilled amen if you fully surrender yourself to the Lord prophecy will be fulfilled Hallelujah so God is going to make it all of this he'll make certain that all of this is done amen hallelujah so if God that he's going to have a bride Made In His Image she's going to be there sure is West we are here this morning amen hallelujah amen see there'll be a people that are truly one with him have been so made that God's nature is in them I'm not going to read this from Oneness now the first man of first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired to talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve now they were so perfect in harmony uh with God till they were one with God God and his family was one any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family as one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with child all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture that's God's purpose and his purpose is Father Supreme was to be one with his family Earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way they could be one with the family all with God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other and God they all become one isn't that a beautiful picture God and his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one praise the Lord now it is not the very nature of God and it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man Hallelujah so now at the very nature of God is in us then we are one with God praise the Lord irrespective of our feelings and different things so now at the very Nature's in us now we can now Rejoice because we'll just follow in line with God we'll follow in line with his word you can't help but to follow in line with it because you are one with him Hallelujah said no Here Comes Easter you know I'm going to wrap this up about soon but you know you see now remember real worship moves the heart of God hey man and and and it moves the heart of God as you know that God's uh our desires will be released to us brother Braham says the reason that the angel of God comes down into the meetings is that God would release our desires to us so if we ever desire for healing or for salvation or for deliverance maybe someone not even here but somewhere else God can release that desire to you and I Faith Rises to get a hold of the promise and God manifests that promise Hallelujah so now a real worship amen a stimulation by Revelation moves the heart of God just like he has to move the heart of the king see Allah our lord Jesus loves it when we respond to him when he whispers his love secrets into our hearts amen see when we say amen and enjoy him it moves his heart see the lord taketh pleasure in his people Psalms 149 and 1 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the Timberland heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their bed so if we go back to that verse 4 for the lord taketh pleasure in his people amen amen do you see yourself in that scripture I trust you do he taketh pleasure in you he's not ashamed of you he doesn't want to leave you in a corner and say no don't come out you know don't don't let anyone see you no he taketh pleasure in you behold my wife she's up today Hallelujah I get to walk with her today I get to talk with her spend time with her amen he takes pleasure in you you are his Delight this is what he thinks about you he's not ashamed of you he's not embarrassed by you he's proud of you praise the Lord amen Zephaniah 3 and 17 the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will Rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing amen many times you think well we will rejoice in him but he rejoices in US amen he rejoices over us with joy not with regret not with sorrow but with joy he's happy when he says you're walking upon the Earth redeemed he's like there's my joy there's my heart's desire there she is Isn't She Wonderful that's what he thinks about you yeah you have a bad day and you think well if I'm really gonna make it well you gotta think about what does God think about me he has a joy over me Hallelujah praise the Lord amen so now remember Esther Esther came before the king and I'm going to wrap up with these few thoughts here Esther came in before the king she had two things on her heart the salvation of her people and the destruction of her enemy those are the two things that were on her heart right and you know if we're really serious if we're really honest we have those two things on our heart when we come to church when we kneel down in prayer when we open the Bible we listen to the message we have those two things the salvation of our people yeah we all want the family circles to be unbroken on that day we want our loved ones in but yo we won though we're on the salvation of them and we want the destruction of our enemy amen that he'll be cast out of every life that is plans will come to nothing that will actually backfire you know every every sin he's going to pay for everything he's going to pay for remember all the sins he's trying to impart upon your life they just return to the head of the accuser yes where once he accused God you know before God day night say they did this and they did this and they did this but on the day the great whites are in judgment because he doesn't realize but a transfer has been going on when we confess ascended into the blood of Jesus Christ they had known a lot of trust anymore and they're allotted to the accuser because he is the not the Creator but he perverted amen righteousness into sin and cause it all to happen so there'll be a that day where all the fingers all the accusations where once he was trying to pour it on the people we'll backfire and come back onto him Amen to he's going to pay for every one of them every every time there's a fear and a sin and a separation and pain every every sickness every every death everything he will pay for that Hallelujah and we'll rejoice when he's passing the Lake of Fire amen so we're looking CeCe we're coming to God's presence with those two things Hallelujah and now he wants us to speak it to him amen when the spirit of God begins to move that's when it's the time to start talking to God I mean don't don't keep your mouth silenced but speak to him so God I have a need you have placed me as Queen I have the crown on my head I know who I am I know who you made me to be but I have family that must come I've Got Friends that must come I mean they must be delivered I want to see my enemy burn and I'll see my family restored that's what I want to see oh God and you have the power I mean to reverse the curse you have the power to reverse the order I mean and change this whole situation hallelujah amen this is why we come to church isn't it amen amen you'll see God move and what we think is impossible situations see God move on the situation and do exactly what he wants to do but he's looking for you you've got to talk to him yes I'm not worthy he's made you worthy Esther Esther was given the crown I was going to repeat that again Esther was given the crown as a crown of Grace I'm in the Robes of righteousness were put on her shoulders just like you the righteous of God you've been robbed in it and you can't take it off if you're the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't take it off you arrived in it you say well I'm not much of a Christian if the weakest of Christians gets on their knees the kingdom of Health shakes they must not about what you think you are it's what God says he is and what he has done in your life that's what matters see we've got to take our focus on our off ourselves and onto the Lord we have a perfect lamb he's a spotless lamb a one without blemish an all-powerful lamb that's stood on our behalf that day on Calvary and went up into heaven into City on our behalf and because his blood is accepted I'm accepted God never looks at the worshiper he looks at the lamb hallelujah we're going to keep that before us I have a perfect lamb I've got a perfect sacrifice I don't need to patch it up I don't need to make it better it's been accepted amen as holy spirit's come upon my life he's changed me from a heart of Doubt into Faith Hallelujah changed my life and because I have a perfect Landmark come boldly before his presence I can ask whatever ask whatever you desire shall be given unto you if two agree on Earth concerning anything I'll do it that's why I need to start agreeing I want to see my family save while you agree for my family I'll agree for your family I mean we're two omnipotents meet the supernatural takes place all right so we're gonna start agreeing for one another we agree for our families we agree for our loved ones we agree for our work colleagues whoever it may be our friends at school we agree for them amen do you agree with me today maybe the healing will take place salvation will take place people come and find their rest in this place oh Leah we agreed for that don't we maybe they can be across the streets who cares about the sea God is still there Hallelujah we agree amen hallelujah because his word says it not because we're enthused the only reason I could be enthused is because it's worth it oh well so grip your brother Chris yo you said at camp that we could have a word Revival a Revival based on the word maybe when we look at the word and it awakens us saying Lord these promises are mine Hallelujah you're here to manifest them in my life not a Revival On Emotion but a Revival on the word Hallelujah and the whole word has come open in this hour amen amen so there there was The Cece she had to speak she said you had saved me see she lumped herself in with her family with her people because she was one of them we're gonna have feelings for our family and loved ones who are lost and undone we're going to say while they're there and here I am and you know we said no she included herself because she was one of them Hallelujah and she said look King my life is under death and then that made the king mad who would who would dare touch my queen who did come against my wife who would did try and take her life you know yo many times we're scared the wrath of God will be poured out upon us you know God's Wrath was poured out that down Calvary Jesus took our judgment the Judgment we should have received it was poured out upon him remember the price of sin was a great price yes when he was mad more than any man he hung on Calvary Between Heaven and Earth a great price was paid the Judgment we should have received he took it all Hallelujah so the wrath of God cannot come upon you because it's come upon him he fulfilled it that damn Calvary amen right remember he went as a sinner to Hell on your behalf that you don't have to go oh Hallelujah he paid it all that's why we don't have to go through a Great Tribulation for a purging because he took all of our judgment everything that day so the wrath of God you say well that's pretty bold this is how I feel yes I stand sinless righteous mindless image no spot against me because of his blood I can stand in confidence so there's no judgment for me because he took my judgment that down Calvary and I can come before his presence anytime I have need of so we get scared oh the wrath of God's gonna be poured out against us now the only one the wrath of God is going to be poured out against the is Satan righteous like the Wrath of the King was poured out against Haman Hallelujah amen that is the same thing with you and I see see we should never be afraid God's Gonna punish us sure he can correct us but he's not going to pour His wrath out against us he wants to guide Our Lives correct us because he wants a closer walk so it's a good thing when those things happen right but we're not going to receive his judgment because he took his judgment that don't he took out judgment on Calvary praise the Lord amen said no the Wrath of the King was poured out against Haman right and then he was hang on The Gallows The Gallows that were made for Mordecai he was hung on them just like this whole you know the devil thinks he's going to destroy you and I but actually it's actually just going to destroy him well he thinks that the seed of God will be thrown to the Lake of Fire not one of them are gonna go one of them can go God cannot lose a part of himself Hallelujah amen now we're going to have a burden that we're going to realize people that we speak to our families they're part of God so they can't be lost Lord they've got to come I believe they're part of you Hallelujah and then said no the Wrath of the King was poured out against Haman but that's not the end of it wait no actually the Signet ring the of authority was given to Mordecai to Easter to write another law to overshadow what the devil had done Hallelujah so now the Signet ring of authority has been given to the bride what ye say whatever you bought on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever is loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven right she's got it he's given you the power to speak right to reverse what the devil has done sure to be according to the word it won't be outside the word don't get me wrong about those things but you have power to speak amen where are we speaking faith that now that God will work on your behalf Hallelujah that's amazing though even though that the law was reversed even though Heyman was hung even though it was proclaimed that actually Mordecai was now the Prime Minister and he was a Jew there's still some people still yeah gathered to try and destroy the Jews the devil's back was broken on Calvary he's just a wounded animal right and sputs but for some reason the devil still try and band together to come against you and I to destroy us right but the law the word has been reversed now that we are the Victor and not the victim amen amen amen we are the Victor we are the Overcomer Hallelujah but what I love about it is that they were given a day where they could actually go and destroy their enemies the Jews could and take their spoils I mean with the Enemy may have stole their joy and stole their peace and stole their love and stole their long suffering and all those things they could come and take those spoils back Hallelujah but it didn't just happen once it happened twice you gotta read the book of Esther they didn't just do it once they did it twice amen so we shouldn't be satisfied with one victory let's go kill them again let's go out and Destroy enemies again take back things again Hallelujah praise the Lord Hallelujah amen praise the Lord no it says here see we live in a different hour now we once were in mourning now we're in rejoicing now why is this a feast of Purim because we're going to realize if God has won the victory here here he's won the victory here Hallelujah your brother bam said this is such a precious quote here with you know maybe I'll finish you know I'm about to close her I'm trying to close or one of those things now he says and and here he says now doesn't Lord show us the father and it's sufficeth us he says and that's the way a Christian is we are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey everything that means everything not some things most things everything Divine Healing the power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for your planted in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for this life's journey even the Rapture is right in you then that's right that's right praise God you said well I need faith for a Rapture if you've got the Holy Ghost that's in you the Rapture is actually already in you see it should take all the fear out am I going to make it well if you've really got the Holy Ghost you're there hey man you the the Rapture is already in you now hello aces are proven by the gospel those who he called he justified and those who he justified he hath glorified Hallelujah then in heaven today we are glorified and the prince of God now he says I'm just pushing out to it amen so now he's just pushing out to it he's just growing into it praise the Lord and that's what we're doing it's already within us but we're just pushing out we're just growing out into it amen amen see it's already in me but it's just going to become material praise the Lord see one day the Rapture will become material these bodies will be changed right it's already the rapture's already within but it's gonna because remember God works from the inside out he doesn't work from the outside in he works from the inside out that's why your heart's will be going to change from doubt to Faith right and then and then and then there goes from the Outside Inside Out see it's already in me it's just becoming material like a little baby growing into an adult all of their potentials they'll reach in intelligence ability stature is already in them by their DNA praise the Lord now Sons and Daughters of God have a spiritual DNA amen that now we're just pushing out to it we just drink and push out that's why it's so important Amen to feed on the word feed on the word listen to the tapes read your Bible pray every day absorb it comprehend it meditate upon it think on the promises right what are you doing drinking then you begin to push out amen every promise is already laying there now the reason we can have a feast of pyramid we can Rejoice from what because one Victory is one that means the other one's coming it's because if God has promised one he's gonna he's fulfilled one he'll fulfill the other that's why it's so important acts 16 it says it's about the Philippine Jailer and he brought the mountain sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house right so now he would already become a Believer now what must I do he was already a Believer believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved Hallelujah so now if one party will be fulfilled the next part will be fulfilled you're following me that's why we can have confidence now we could have a feast of pyramid say the devil's being defeated amen Hallelujah one Victor has been one another Victory is on the way but because this Victory is being won this Victory is going to be won but it's just time has to go until that Victory is won but it's as good as done that's why we can rejoice and shout and praise God Amen that now there's the time we can have a feast of Purim just like every year they commemorate Haman being killed the victory that happened back there now we can take every Victory through the scripture let it and look at them it'll accumulate faith in your life take all the prayer lines take your own testimony testimonies Among Us and use it to accumulate Faith saying Lord you did it for them you can do it for me Lord you did it for that family you can do it for my family Lord that situation do it for my situation and
