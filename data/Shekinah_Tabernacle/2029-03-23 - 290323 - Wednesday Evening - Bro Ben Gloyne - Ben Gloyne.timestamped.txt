[26:43] dear God May forgive us all our sins
[26:45] cover us in your blood tonight Lord amen
[26:47] you receive will honor glory and praise
[26:49] and Lord may you also be with those who
[26:51] couldn't be here tonight as well be
[26:52] their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's
[26:54] name amen hey man God bless you friends
[26:57] you may have your seats tonight so I
[26:59] want to talk about you know we know we
[27:00] understand that when we take the um take
[27:03] the communion and we know it's just
[27:04] symbols of of the Lord's body the bread
[27:06] and the and the wine being symbolic of
[27:08] his blood but we're making a public
[27:10] testimony we've become one with our
[27:12] sacrifice and and his life is is now
[27:15] flowing in our lives now but I want to I
[27:18] want to just kind of bring this to our
[27:19] attention a bit here where where this
[27:22] it's very interesting when you look at
[27:23] this where it says the least of my
[27:24] brethren many times we'll read these
[27:26] kind of scriptures and just kind of Let
[27:29] It Go by the wayside because
[27:31] um you know we think well it doesn't
[27:32] really bother us or pertain to us but
[27:34] it's amazing how you know if we're
[27:36] really a Believer we'll treat people
[27:37] differently and um and even when we read
[27:40] First Corinthians 11 it says that many
[27:42] are sick or sleep because they don't
[27:43] discern the Lord's body where they could
[27:45] not discern actually look beyond the
[27:47] Flesh of someone and see the Lord and
[27:49] that person and so now this word little
[27:52] ones or little here it's the same one as
[27:55] as we would probably be more familiar
[27:58] with with the scripture where the Lord
[27:59] says for example in Matthew 18 and 6
[28:01] this is for whoso shall offend one of
[28:04] these my little ones which believeth in
[28:06] me it is better for him that a millstone
[28:07] be were hanged about his neck and we're
[28:09] drowned in the depths of the sea so this
[28:12] this word leased from the least of my
[28:14] brethren actually the root word of that
[28:16] word is actually this one little ones
[28:18] here and that and that little means
[28:21] actually it doesn't just mean the size
[28:23] or a stature but it means an age by a
[28:25] birth or being younger so we could
[28:27] actually change a bit and this is not
[28:30] changing the scripture but someone who's
[28:31] younger someone who's a child or a baby
[28:33] we could say they are immature they
[28:35] haven't become fully grown they're not
[28:37] fully adults yet they are growing to
[28:39] become that but they are not mature so
[28:41] we could say they are immature ones so
[28:43] someone who's a uh immature one you know
[28:47] and and I want to talk more spiritually
[28:48] as opposed to physically here but you
[28:51] know there's there's there's people in
[28:52] the body of Christ who could say they
[28:54] are little ones they are not mature you
[28:57] know they're they're still babies in the
[28:59] faith but that's okay as long as there's
[29:00] life as long as they're growing so you
[29:02] know it doesn't matter if you're a
[29:03] toddler in the Lord or you're some old
[29:05] age veteran spiritually speaking you
[29:08] know we're still the part of the same
[29:09] body of Christ but you see now it says
[29:12] as you've done unto the least of these
[29:14] my brethren so you can say as you've
[29:16] done unto the immature ones unto the
[29:19] ones who are not fully developed those
[29:21] who are still growing maybe they're
[29:22] still even in diapers spiritually and
[29:24] you know they've just been birthed
[29:25] they've just met the Lord you know those
[29:28] ones you could say they're still babies
[29:29] in the faith now this has nothing to do
[29:31] with your natural age people could be in
[29:33] their 80s and still be a baby
[29:34] spiritually that's okay as long as
[29:37] there's life God will get us to maturity
[29:38] we understand that and whatever God
[29:40] thinks of maturity is the thing that's
[29:42] important it's not what we think is
[29:44] mature because often man you know if
[29:47] we're honest what man thinks is right
[29:48] and what God thinks is right it's not
[29:50] even on the same scale you know so
[29:53] so but we know we've matured when these
[29:55] bodies change we understand that right
[29:57] we know we've made it when these bodies
[29:58] change okay but someone who's immature
[30:01] you know you think of someone naturally
[30:02] someone who goes from a child into
[30:04] adulthood you know going through going
[30:06] through puberty going through the
[30:07] teenage years you know they have mood
[30:09] swings they have emotional outbursts
[30:11] they get moody they do crazy things
[30:12] sometimes and you know Medical Science
[30:15] tells us that the brain their brain is
[30:17] not fully developed so they can't even
[30:19] make sound well thought out decisions
[30:20] yet Medical Science tells us that it's a
[30:23] it says that you should be at least 25
[30:25] years old before you make a
[30:26] life-changing decision
[30:28] because your brain is still growing yeah
[30:31] yeah amen I think I'm there hopefully
[30:34] that could be debatable anyway
[30:37] but you see we can understand that
[30:39] naturally we say Well they're a teenager
[30:41] or they're a kitten you know and you can
[30:43] expect children to do crazy stuff and
[30:45] have wild outbursts and be moody and
[30:46] have mood swings and up and down and but
[30:48] you know because you understand that
[30:50] because they're children you know
[30:51] they're growing then it's very easy to
[30:53] have to be patient with them to be
[30:55] long-suffering with them because you
[30:56] know the way they're acting now is not
[30:58] how they're going to act in the future
[30:59] because they're growing they're going
[31:01] through a stage right they're not you
[31:02] know they're not going to be this way
[31:03] forever and but the thing is it's easy
[31:06] to look at people naturally and be
[31:07] patient with them because they're well
[31:08] they're teenagers they're hormones and
[31:10] things are going crazy they don't even
[31:12] know who they are really and you know
[31:13] they're changing and you know I remember
[31:14] being 18 it was a horrible time of life
[31:17] for me I didn't enjoy it
[31:19] was a dumb age I'm so glad I'm not 18
[31:22] anymore if you are 18 and if you know
[31:24] the Lord that's great but you know it's
[31:25] like a it's it's like brother Isaac
[31:28] showed you know the youth going around
[31:29] the corn and the go-karts as long as you
[31:31] get around the corner hey have your
[31:33] cart's on fire at least you get around
[31:34] the corner you know you may be smooth
[31:36] maybe not but as long as you get around
[31:39] but there's a lot of things going on in
[31:41] your life I mean there's a lot of
[31:42] changes but we understand those things
[31:44] so it can be long-suffering with those
[31:45] kind of people but
[31:48] you know but what about now spiritually
[31:49] immature people
[31:51] you know because sometimes we can look
[31:53] at an adult
[31:54] and we can and and they may be still
[31:56] spiritual babies we get frustrated with
[31:58] them in a different way that we wouldn't
[31:59] get frustrated with a naturally a
[32:00] teenager if you think man they should be
[32:03] further along God should be you know but
[32:05] the thing is it says to the least of my
[32:07] immature ones you do it unto me so it's
[32:10] more we're going to look at each other I
[32:11] think a bit differently you know we
[32:13] should you know I was telling I was
[32:16] um I was you know I was talking to a
[32:17] young brother and and Chile and he was
[32:20] in a roundabout way saying he's unhappy
[32:22] with his pastor and I and I said well
[32:24] you know it's just like naturally a
[32:27] child when they're young they think
[32:28] their parents are superheroes they can
[32:30] do anything but then you come to an age
[32:32] when you begin to grow up you're going
[32:33] to realize actually your parents are
[32:35] adults I mean I mean they're human they
[32:38] make mistakes they're you know they're
[32:39] fallible when you're a child they were
[32:41] still adults they were still the same
[32:43] people but because you're because you're
[32:45] a baby you couldn't you couldn't you
[32:47] couldn't see them for what they really
[32:48] were but then you come to a stage we
[32:50] begin to see them for who they really
[32:51] are and it can be a shock when you
[32:53] realize dad's not a superhero anymore
[32:55] oh Mom's not a superhero anymore but
[32:57] then as you keep growing and you get
[32:59] become an adult then you appreciate your
[33:02] parents far more than you did when you
[33:04] thought they are superheroes
[33:05] right because you see the humanity but
[33:08] you appreciate all that they did for you
[33:10] I hope you kind of give me that kind of
[33:12] Grace right you know but it's the same
[33:15] thing as an adult growing and people
[33:16] growing in the Lord amen but
[33:19] but because perception has changed off
[33:21] my you know my voice packs up well
[33:23] that's fine amen okay so what about
[33:26] those now who are spiritually immature
[33:27] now now we know people when they first
[33:30] come to the Lord we have all kind of
[33:31] complexes we have all kind of pains and
[33:34] hurts and like our life is a chaos but
[33:37] God doesn't leave us in that chaos
[33:39] and the thing is though people who are
[33:41] spiritually immature will say it like
[33:42] this is that they allow those complexes
[33:44] pains and hurts to still rule their
[33:46] lives
[33:47] amen you know that you know that's how I
[33:49] feel about it you know that you know
[33:50] that someone who's mature can actually
[33:52] actually separate
[33:54] they they're not run by their feelings
[33:55] anymore they're not dictated to by their
[33:58] past anymore because the Lord has dealt
[34:00] with it and they know he's dealt with it
[34:01] and they now have a victory where they
[34:03] once had a defeat amen so they can they
[34:06] can look at life differently because God
[34:08] has grown them up they're not tossed to
[34:09] and fro anymore
[34:11] but there's still going to be spirit I I
[34:13] might be wrong because people think that
[34:15] the bride is going to be an utmost
[34:17] Perfection when the Rapture goes of
[34:18] maturity and humanly maybe not
[34:24] we're still going to have little ones
[34:25] this is just me you may disagree well
[34:28] the well the wheat's got to come to
[34:29] grain and you've got to come to maturity
[34:31] and but what is that maturity going to
[34:32] look like
[34:33] you know are we going to walk around and
[34:35] just have no problems
[34:38] no
[34:39] we're going to have problems still we're
[34:42] going to have complexes still
[34:44] maybe right we're still going to have
[34:47] pain and things in our minds we're going
[34:48] to be questioning and and wondering and
[34:50] why you know wrestle within wrestling
[34:52] with our personalities
[34:54] well this is not very Victorious but the
[34:56] thing it well that's what you might be
[34:58] thinking why are you preaching this to
[34:59] us well we've got to come to terms with
[35:01] actually our Victory is not based on how
[35:03] we feel our Victory is not based on our
[35:05] personality our Victory is not based on
[35:07] how sick or I mean or how well we are
[35:10] and body how much finances we have
[35:12] external things it's based on what the
[35:14] Lord has done for our souls amen that's
[35:16] where our Victory lays amen you take the
[35:19] two on the way to Emmaus they were in
[35:21] the greatest moment in history the death
[35:23] burial Resurrection Lord Jesus Christ
[35:25] brother Ram says that that the two on
[35:27] the way to a masses prophecy mondavis
[35:29] made clear by prophecy and those two
[35:31] prophecy speaking of a people that will
[35:33] fulfill that prophecy the Believers are
[35:35] brokenhearted downcast their whole world
[35:37] has fallen apart but they're part of the
[35:38] resurrection and brother I am saying is
[35:40] they are prophesying over future people
[35:42] so you know we're going to look at life
[35:44] a bit differently we're not going to
[35:45] have it all together when these bodies
[35:47] are changed necessarily we may be it may
[35:49] be the worst moments of our life
[35:51] that was the worst moment of their life
[35:54] their Messiah was dead the treasury
[35:56] committed suicide the preachers had to
[35:58] hold themselves up in a place somewhere
[35:59] their whole world had fallen apart but
[36:02] yet he walked with them revealing
[36:04] himself until they realized one he had
[36:07] resurrected but two he they were part of
[36:09] that Resurrection
[36:10] I mean so we can't we're we're not going
[36:13] to go on a Rapture because we're in some
[36:14] Nirvana state
[36:17] praise God
[36:19] so let's just throw that out of the way
[36:21] okay
[36:24] so maybe the spiritually immature will
[36:26] always be with us
[36:28] okay
[36:30] don't settle for being immature though
[36:31] grow let the Lord change our lives
[36:34] amen so it's those okay so so what about
[36:36] the ones who are complexed those are
[36:39] hurting the height behind bravado or
[36:42] insecure they're double-minded see
[36:44] people can have all those things and
[36:45] still be Believers they're still going
[36:47] to rapture
[36:49] right
[36:51] I'm sorry this is not a victory dance
[36:53] but we're going to look at what see we
[36:56] can't have a condescending look on
[36:58] people see Lucifer said I know I'm going
[37:01] to preach at one day I preach it in in
[37:02] Chile he said I'll Ascend above the
[37:04] stars of God so he says I'm going to
[37:06] ascend and look down on them the ones
[37:09] who are inherited will receive all
[37:11] things from God be part of him I'm going
[37:13] to send a look down on these people
[37:15] condescending look down upon them we
[37:17] can't have that kind of view in our
[37:19] lives none of his attributes belong to
[37:22] us yeah of the devil so we can't look at
[37:25] we can't look at someone say Well
[37:27] they're never going to get there they're
[37:28] always going to be a problem in things
[37:30] and we can't look at people like that
[37:33] as you've done to the least of my little
[37:34] ones you've done unto me
[37:40] how do we do we bear with them
[37:43] do we bear with them that have had a
[37:45] real experience in the Lord but yet in
[37:47] their Spirit they're still wrestling
[37:49] in terms of complexes pains in their
[37:51] past is still dealing with those they're
[37:53] still you know how do we how do we treat
[37:55] those kind of believers
[37:57] do we push them to the Wayside do we do
[38:00] we speak evil of them
[38:02] or do we or do we do we love them
[38:05] do we treat them with with probably more
[38:07] love than someone else
[38:09] you know it's the it's this it's the
[38:12] Young
[38:13] that actually dictate how fast we go
[38:15] into a rapture
[38:16] because because the Lord said in
[38:18] Deuteronomy that as a father does bear
[38:21] his son so I carried you to this place
[38:24] out of Egypt into the promised land so
[38:26] it's not the pace of the strong or the
[38:28] fast or the young
[38:30] that actually dictates the bride's
[38:32] journey into Glory that's it's the young
[38:34] it's maybe the feeble that think they
[38:36] can't make it because they're part of
[38:37] God they're going to make it it's those
[38:39] ones
[38:40] praise the Lord
[38:42] Hallelujah blessed us your weakened
[38:45] spirit
[38:45] porn spirit amen you know Jesus spoke
[38:48] about those things
[38:49] we're blessed you say well I'm feeling
[38:51] like I'm not blessed you're a blessed
[38:53] person if you're part of whom you're a
[38:55] very blessed person
[38:56] it means it's not the strong it's like
[38:58] when Christy and I took the family over
[39:00] to Canada you know we're going through
[39:01] customs in L.A and jet lagged and well
[39:04] that was me and didn't know where I was
[39:05] and you know but it wasn't me and
[39:07] Christine's Pace getting from one gate
[39:09] to another that dictated us getting
[39:11] there it was the the children we
[39:13] couldn't leave them behind you can't
[39:15] leave your family behind you've got to
[39:16] carry them all that's the same thing
[39:18] with God you know we may feel like we're
[39:20] going slow but God will carry us through
[39:23] now I say all this but uh but I'm not
[39:26] don't get me wrong and say I'm not
[39:28] telling you just live in a defeated
[39:29] State and think that this is just how
[39:31] you're going to be no we're going from
[39:32] Victory to Victory
[39:33] right but you know we shouldn't let
[39:35] those things rule Our Lives
[39:39] you know how we treat people does not
[39:41] give us license to treat them the same
[39:43] way
[39:44] Jesus it's amazing I was just looking at
[39:46] the statement where where the Lord said
[39:47] in Matthew 7 and 12 therefore all things
[39:50] whatsoever you would that ye would that
[39:53] men should do to you can you put this uh
[39:55] maybe not yeah can we put it up Matthew
[39:57] 7 and 12.
[40:02] this is this to me what do we got is
[40:04] this a honey drink
[40:06] or something
[40:09] brother Pedro and I lived on this in
[40:11] Chile
[40:12] thank you
[40:15] all right
[40:18] Matthew 7 and 12.
[40:20] 7 and 12. yeah no not that one
[40:22] that's not our scripture
[40:28] we've got a seven and a top it's coming
[40:30] it's all right pause for effect here we
[40:33] go therefore all things whatever you do
[40:35] that men that you would that men would
[40:37] do should do to you do you even so to
[40:40] them
[40:41] so whatever you do to others do as a
[40:43] unto yourself for this is the law and
[40:46] the prophets
[40:48] so you mean the whole Old Testament is
[40:49] encapsulated in this one phrase
[40:51] absolutely
[40:53] so
[40:54] we should treat others how we want to be
[40:56] treated that's basically what Jesus is
[40:57] saying they're saying the whole Old
[40:59] Testament is encapsulated in that one
[41:00] phrase so if I want to be treated well
[41:03] I'm going to treat others well
[41:05] yeah right not based on how they treat
[41:07] me
[41:07] now I'm going to do unto others as I
[41:10] would have them do unto me
[41:12] it says in First Peter 3 and 9 not
[41:14] rendering evil for evil or rallying for
[41:17] railing but contrast blessing
[41:19] knowing that ye are there unto called
[41:23] that ye should inherit a blessing so we
[41:26] shouldn't render evil for evil
[41:29] amen we shouldn't be railing for railing
[41:31] basically we're not reactionary
[41:33] the believer the world is reactionary
[41:35] but the believer should not be
[41:36] reactionary what does reactionary mean
[41:38] well you react based on how someone
[41:40] treats you first so if they're nice to
[41:42] me I'll react and be nice to them if
[41:44] they're mean to me I'll react and be
[41:45] mean to them we're not meant to be those
[41:47] kind of soundboards amen if someone
[41:49] loves you you love them if they hate you
[41:50] you love them if they're mean to you you
[41:52] love them if they speak you love you you
[41:54] love them right if if they treat you
[41:57] with absolute absolute disrespect you
[41:59] Retreat them with respect you treat them
[42:01] with love
[42:02] amen because knowing that ye are there
[42:05] unto called that you shouldn't hear it a
[42:07] blessing
[42:09] amen that's why you should contrast not
[42:11] railing for railing or evil for evil but
[42:13] contrast blessing knowing that you there
[42:15] aren't too cold that you shouldn't hear
[42:16] a blessing you know
[42:20] it's amazing how some people think that
[42:22] the great white Throne judgment or the
[42:23] Judgment seat of Christ works
[42:25] we know the Judgment seat of Christ we
[42:27] shall all stand before it it's for
[42:29] rewards right there's a great way I
[42:31] thought judgment the bride doesn't go
[42:32] there right but there's a judgment seat
[42:34] of Christ
[42:36] but it's amazing how some people think
[42:38] um you know think those judgments work
[42:40] like for example people think that
[42:42] they're going to stand before God one
[42:44] day and God's going to say what did you
[42:45] do with me and they'll say well this
[42:48] this hypocrite did this in church and
[42:50] this pastor to this church and this
[42:52] Deacon did this and this Scandal
[42:53] happened here and that's why I didn't
[42:55] serve you and then the Lord says well
[42:56] enter into the joys of the Lord
[42:59] you know that was prepared for you
[43:00] before the foundation of the world
[43:01] that's how some people think it's going
[43:02] to work because these people Hypocrites
[43:05] did all these evil things therefore they
[43:07] didn't that they didn't become
[43:08] Christians so therefore God's going to
[43:09] let them in
[43:10] it's not going to work that way
[43:12] you know because
[43:16] we no one is going to enter into heaven
[43:18] or get any reward
[43:20] for their walk with Lord because they
[43:22] treated somebody bad because that person
[43:24] did it first
[43:26] you're not going to get any blessing for
[43:27] that
[43:28] right
[43:29] we're all going to stand before because
[43:31] it says in Romans 14 and 10 why does
[43:33] thou judge thy brother or why does thou
[43:35] sit at naught thy brother for we shall
[43:37] all stand before the Judgment seat of
[43:39] Christ now so why do you sit at naught
[43:42] by brothers that means to make of no
[43:43] account to despise utterly well how do
[43:46] you see them but not like that you run
[43:48] them down
[43:50] running down brother so-and-so sister
[43:51] so-and-so she's always doing this saying
[43:53] that the other day X Y and Z blah blah
[43:55] blah that's setting them at naught
[43:58] we yo why why do because we're all gonna
[44:00] have to give an account for those things
[44:06] see
[44:08] that's what people but people think that
[44:10] they have license
[44:12] they have license and we shouldn't say
[44:14] well I'm just immature therefore I can
[44:16] do what I want people going to be with
[44:17] me we shouldn't have that in our minds
[44:20] you know so because the question
[44:23] will be
[44:25] why you know why did you because people
[44:28] because the questions will be asked
[44:30] every man woman and child what did you
[44:31] do with my word when it came your way
[44:32] and in reality the question is what did
[44:34] you do with me
[44:36] what did you do with me because
[44:37] sometimes it sounds very impersonal when
[44:39] you say what did you do with God's word
[44:41] this is God in print form so the
[44:43] question will be that day what did you
[44:45] do with me did you allow me to rule your
[44:48] life in the good times and the bad in
[44:50] the in the very uncomfortable stressful
[44:52] times the the times where people were
[44:54] mean to you and evil and stabbed you in
[44:56] the back and spoke evil of you and you
[44:58] know it was harsh and they did things
[45:00] that made no sense what did you do with
[45:02] me in those times did you allow me to
[45:05] rule your life did you allow me to be
[45:07] king and take control of that situation
[45:09] or did you allow your carnal nature to
[45:12] push me aside that it can live and have
[45:14] its way
[45:16] because I tell you what to the carnal
[45:18] man it can be satisfying to get one in
[45:19] there
[45:21] right but we're not called to be carnal
[45:23] we're called to be spiritual
[45:25] we're called to be made in the image of
[45:27] God
[45:28] amen so that's why the question will be
[45:30] you know
[45:32] what did you do with me
[45:34] in those times the Lord speaking here I
[45:37] feel Amy because this is in First
[45:39] Corinthians three and three for for a
[45:41] year yet carnal four hours is there
[45:43] among you envying and strife and
[45:44] divisions are ye not carnal and Walker's
[45:46] men we're not called to walk as men
[45:49] are walking in a certain direction the
[45:52] redeemed walk in another Direction amen
[45:54] and the redeem walk with the word of God
[45:56] so we shouldn't be carnal to be there
[45:58] shouldn't be any envious rifle problems
[46:00] amen sure they can be misunderstandings
[46:02] sure there can be difference of opinion
[46:04] because we're all human
[46:06] right if we sat down and said now what
[46:09] color should the walls be painted or
[46:11] what color should the carpet be or the
[46:12] chairs or the decor we would have every
[46:14] how many people are here everyone would
[46:16] have a different idea and that's fine
[46:18] we're all different
[46:19] right but we shouldn't let those things
[46:22] be a wedge we should appreciate
[46:24] differences like I'm proud to say we're
[46:27] like the United Nations here I'm very
[46:29] happy about that I'm glad we're not just
[46:32] a bunch of white people
[46:34] praise God I'm glad we're a
[46:36] multicultural you know from all parts of
[46:38] the world God can do a super there's a
[46:40] supernatural Gathering
[46:42] different cultures age groups
[46:44] backgrounds whatever whatever we're all
[46:46] one in Christ that's a powerful thing
[46:47] the United Nations can't do what God
[46:49] does here
[46:52] because they all have their own agenda
[46:54] we have one agenda that Jesus Christ
[46:56] will be made on
[46:57] that's incredible they can't even agree
[46:59] on I don't know what
[47:01] oh man I'd be so frustrated sitting in
[47:03] their meetings you know however that
[47:04] works oh boy we have on vetoes and walks
[47:06] out and Stomps and blah and you know man
[47:09] good luck trying to remodel that place
[47:11] with the committee anyway
[47:13] yeah no let's leave that one alone but
[47:16] praise God we're better things than that
[47:19] amen so you know
[47:21] see and and that's why I put this I put
[47:24] this um the quote on the brothers and
[47:26] sisters here I just want to read it here
[47:28] so to me it's powerful now don't you
[47:30] listen to one Falcon the devil has got
[47:31] to say see if the devil shows you some
[47:34] or tells you something evil about one of
[47:35] the members of the body of Christ don't
[47:37] you believe it for as soon as you
[47:38] believe it you my your experience you
[47:41] might your own experience it's not the
[47:43] person being mad it Mars you
[47:44] and if you see one of the members of the
[47:46] body of Christ doing something evil
[47:48] don't tell nobody else but go to that
[47:50] member and with love and see if you can
[47:52] bring them back to Christ again and if
[47:55] you can't do that then tell one person
[47:56] or let them go with you do it the way
[47:58] the scripture says but don't if somebody
[48:01] says sister so-and-so brother son so
[48:03] don't believe one word of it you just
[48:05] leave it go because remember
[48:06] is the devil trying to tear you to
[48:08] pieces now just look for him to come in
[48:11] because he'll do it now you let the good
[48:13] man of the house Faith stand right there
[48:15] and don't don't you receive one thing
[48:18] these people have all set in Heavenly
[48:20] places with you Fellowship together
[48:22] pardon me around the blessings of God
[48:24] taking communion at the table and the
[48:26] Holy Spirit has witnessed that they are
[48:28] the children of God just let just let
[48:30] that real sweet kind-hearted forgiving
[48:33] loving and if the other person talks
[48:34] evil against you you talk sweet against
[48:36] them amen watch how sweeter comes to you
[48:39] then see that's right just always return
[48:42] good for evil love for hate
[48:44] amen that's how we should be
[48:47] there amen because remember and so much
[48:49] you've done to one of these my immature
[48:51] ones you've done unto me
[48:54] right so we shouldn't tear someone down
[48:58] are you all on the same page well don't
[49:00] you know what they did to me Jesus said
[49:03] father forgive them they don't know what
[49:04] they do
[49:06] he could have called for 12 reasons of
[49:07] annuals wiped out level the whole of
[49:10] obviously but because of love he went
[49:12] there
[49:13] and his last one of his last words was
[49:15] forgive them they don't know what they
[49:16] do
[49:17] amen we should be the same way because
[49:19] we had to be like Jesus
[49:22] amen
[49:24] praise the Lord but I hope you don't get
[49:26] me wrong there's overcoming power for
[49:28] all complexes paints hurt your past
[49:29] everything God can take care of it all
[49:31] okay
[49:32] but sometimes people have been birthed
[49:33] into the kingdom but they those things
[49:35] still rule them but do we bear with them
[49:37] do we love them
[49:39] amen like a child becoming an adult
[49:41] going through teenage years
[49:43] amen so
[49:45] we shouldn't we shouldn't let those
[49:46] things trouble us
[49:49] we should love you know there's the
[49:51] world is starving for love
[49:53] and I believe we have Divine love and we
[49:55] should protect Divine love we should
[49:57] nurture it we should treasure what we
[49:59] have in the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:01] amen so now if the Lord can love like
[50:03] that remember he loves the unlovable he
[50:06] Bears remember he was long-suffering
[50:08] with you and I am
[50:09] he was very long suffering he let us go
[50:12] a long time but he knew when he'd find
[50:13] us amen so if so so if he was
[50:16] long-suffering with us can't we be
[50:17] long-suffering with someone else well
[50:19] they should know better we all should
[50:20] have known better
[50:24] in church we all should know better
[50:27] right not one of us is a special case
[50:30] that we had it all together the Bible
[50:33] says we were all like sheep going astray
[50:35] that's right oh not some all
[50:39] do I put my I'm part of the all
[50:42] right amen I went astray but he came and
[50:43] got me back
[50:45] Hallelujah and then he gave his life
[50:48] that we his life would come into us he
[50:51] washes of our sins make us new creatures
[50:54] in Christ amen that's why to me it's
[50:56] such a precious thing we can come and
[50:58] say Lord
[50:59] I wanna I wanna be clean Lord forgive me
[51:02] if I've done wrong forgive me if my
[51:04] tongue is rattle off things against
[51:05] people I've hurt hurt part of you
[51:08] one of your little ones Lord Jesus
[51:11] forgive me if I haven't acted as I
[51:12] should have acted in life and I got to
[51:14] carnal sometimes I lost my vision and
[51:16] been mean and you know
[51:18] they say Lord I want to rededicate my
[51:20] life tonight
[51:22] Hallelujah that when I come to the
[51:24] communion table and I'm showing this
[51:26] world remember there's a public
[51:27] testimony
[51:28] that his body was broken for you
[51:31] and you become one with the lamb just
[51:33] like in the first you could say
[51:35] communion the first Exodus the lamb was
[51:38] shed for the house in Israel they had to
[51:40] eat that lamb
[51:41] and they became and then the blood of
[51:43] course was on the door and lentil right
[51:45] but they became one with their sacrifice
[51:47] and by the power of the Lamb they left
[51:49] Egypt and they went into the Promised
[51:51] Land
[51:52] and so
[51:54] one time you saw the lamb and the family
