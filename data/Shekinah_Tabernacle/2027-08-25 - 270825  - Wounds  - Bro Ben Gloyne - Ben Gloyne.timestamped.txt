[0:01] Maybe we'll do. No, I don't want to joke
[0:04] tonight. But you see, you know, but you
[0:05] see, we get worried about those things,
[0:07] but it can be like a wound where the
[0:09] enemy wants to step in and say, "Look,
[0:10] God doesn't care. God doesn't you've
[0:12] been paying your t tithes faithfully and
[0:14] all these things, and look what happened
[0:15] to you. See, he's not interested in
[0:17] you." And that can see the devil wants
[0:19] to use that wound to bring in a poison,
[0:22] but God wants to use that wound to show
[0:23] his glory.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't let See, he says here in
[0:27] a time of sickness, when sickness
[0:29] strikes and the doctor says there's
[0:31] nothing else I can do, don't build up
[0:32] pressure, let off the pressure. Call
[0:35] your pastor. Let him anoint you in oil
[0:37] and pray over you. Prayer of faith shall
[0:39] save the sick. Let off the pressure.
[0:41] See, he's our refuge. While you're in
[0:43] this refuge, you have a right to
[0:45] anything that's in the refuge. And
[0:47] Christ is our refuge, and everything we
[0:49] have need of is in him. Amen. In
[0:51] sickness, don't build up pressure. Let
[0:53] off pressure. You say, "Well, I wonder,
[0:55] brother Bram." You don't wonder. You
[0:57] just let the pressure off. Commit your
[0:59] case to God and go on as if it is all
[1:02] over. Don't build up pressure. It lets
[1:04] off pressure.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Sickness can strike. It can be a
[1:08] lingering thing. What happens? It's a
[1:11] dark cloud of your spirit tries to come
[1:13] over people and make them down and
[1:15] depressed and always look negative.
[1:17] What's that? The enemy trying to use
[1:18] that wound. But God wants to use that
[1:21] wound. God wants to use that to prove
[1:24] himself. I mean, because God wants to
[1:26] use it that it becomes a testimony for
[1:28] you and I.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, you say, "Well,
[1:31] you say, "I'm so worried, Brother
[1:33] Brandham." You don't um I just don't
[1:35] know. Let off the pressure. Amen. In the
[1:37] city of refuge, he took your worry, so
[1:39] you don't have to have it. Cast your
[1:40] cares on him, for he carth for you.
[1:42] Don't you worry about your cares. That's
[1:45] his business. And he's good at what he
[1:48] does.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this wounding now we
[1:51] read about about the serpent with of
[1:53] course our Lord Jesus. We know that
[1:54] every every uh all healing was purchased
[1:58] at day on Calvary salvation deliverance
[2:02] everything in the atonements not just
[2:03] for heal I mean salvation of the soul
[2:06] but it's for healing of the spirit and
[2:07] body complete. Amen. So he was his
[2:10] wounding was perfect if I put it that
[2:12] way. Amen. He purchased our our full
[2:15] redemption and whole that day. He didn't
[2:17] have to pay anymore. We didn't have to
[2:19] pay off interest or any other debt. Our
[2:21] sin debt was paid that day on Calvary.
[2:23] Amen. So, we can let off the pressure.
[2:25] We say those wounds, we needed those
[2:27] wounds.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; Our sin caused those wounds, but we
[2:31] needed those wounds.
[2:34] Amen. It's like um like brother Brandon
[2:36] says um on that day on Calvary, what did
[2:38] he do? He zeroed in on Calvary. He
[2:40] wounded that animal called Satan
[2:42] forever. Amen. Now, he's been more
[2:44] vicious since then because it's brought
[2:46] light to the human race. Amen. Because
[2:48] remember, his head was crushed or
[2:50] bruised, the serpent's head that day on
[2:52] Calvary. Amen. So, and so now he's more
[2:54] vicious now than he ever was in the
[2:57] history of the world. I say he's even
[2:59] more vicious in 2025 than he was 2,000
[3:02] years ago cuz even more light's been
[3:04] shone. I mean, the title deed of
[3:06] redemption, the seals have come off the
[3:08] book. I mean, Christ has become fully
[3:10] unveiled. That's why the devil's such a
[3:13] vicious beast in this day. Amen. Why?
[3:15] because there's been light has been uh
[3:18] given to the human race. And anyone
[3:20] knows that a wounded animal is its most
[3:22] vicious crawling around with its back
[3:24] broke. Amen. Now, Satan was knocked out
[3:26] at Calvary. The earth proved that it was
[3:28] the greatest price that was ever paid.
[3:30] The only one that could pay it, come and
[3:32] done it at Calvary. That's where the
[3:33] great price was paid. That's one of the
[3:36] things God had required it. No man was
[3:38] worthy. No ma man was able. No one no
[3:40] man could do it. And God came himself
[3:43] and was made human and lived in a human
[3:44] life under human desires and was
[3:47] crucified at Calvary. And there when
[3:49] Satan thought he wouldn't do it, he
[3:51] wouldn't go through it. He went through
[3:53] Gethsemane and every temptation any man
[3:55] ever stood, he went through it just like
[3:57] all men. But he paid the price. I'll say
[4:00] the wounds that our Lord Jesus received,
[4:02] being scorged, scourged, being um, you
[4:05] know, crucified, many other men had
[4:07] received those wounds, but he was a
[4:09] different kind of a man. He is more than
[4:11] a man, more than a prophet. He was the
[4:13] God prophet. He was Emmanuel, God with
[4:16] us. Amen. So when he was wounded, it
[4:18] brought out something different. Amen.
[4:20] Because when everyone else was
[4:21] crucified, it just brought death. It was
[4:23] the end of it. Amen. But when he was
[4:25] crucified, it released eternal life,
[4:27] amen, upon the human race for those who
[4:29] would receive it. Amen. Not only that,
[4:31] the bride of Jesus Christ was released
[4:33] out of him.
[4:35] Praise the Lord.
[4:37] Amen. But you see now the enemy is is is
[4:40] in such a rage and we can see it very
[4:43] much in this day when people get all
[4:45] tore up and get you know you know you
[4:47] know that you know um a temper tantrum
[4:50] is the first sign of insanity first
[4:52] stage of insanity. Brother Ram would
[4:54] speak about it about when the hogs were,
[4:56] you know, you know, the maniac of Gdara
[4:58] there and the, you know, the, you know,
[5:00] the legion was cast out of him and those
[5:02] spirits before they were cast out and
[5:04] they asked, "Can we go into those pigs
[5:06] at least?" Because spirits always need
[5:08] something to work through. And then so
[5:10] so they um, you know, Jesus permitted
[5:12] them to go into the hogs. And what the
[5:13] hogs do? They had a temper fit. They ran
[5:15] down into the into the lake there and
[5:18] they drowned themselves. And he said
[5:20] they choked themselves in the river.
[5:21] Isn't that right? Now, they did it. Of
[5:23] course, the devils went out of them cuz
[5:24] it killed the hogs. It just run them
[5:26] into a fit. They had a fit like anyone.
[5:29] Did you ever see a person have a temper
[5:30] fit? You ever seen that? They just begin
[5:33] to fire out words and just lose their
[5:35] cool and they're not even sane anymore
[5:36] and they just blast everything and they
[5:38] break things and shout and curse and do
[5:40] all kind of crazy. Who's seen that?
[5:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know what it was like
[5:45] that day in Gdara when that when those
[5:47] hogs ran into the water.
[5:51] Amen. And it's just them devils. That's
[5:52] what happened to them. You ever seen one
[5:54] of them having a temper fit? You say,
[5:55] "Uh-huh. I I know what happened in
[5:57] Gdara." Now, see, that's just exactly
[5:59] just a few more come in there run him
[6:01] completely insane. Cuz the medical
[6:03] doctor will tell you that a temper is
[6:05] the first stage of insanity. That's what
[6:06] Mayo says, the first stage of insanity.
[6:10] Well, what happens is normally a temper
[6:12] saying something because something will
[6:13] strike someone and cause them to react a
[6:15] certain way. Maybe it's something they
[6:17] don't want to do, but they need to do
[6:18] it. Maybe they've crashed a car or they
[6:20] run a light or they road rage and all
[6:22] these things, they just let it fly. What
[6:24] is that? That is actually the first
[6:26] stage of insanity trying to set into
[6:28] that person. The pressure of life can
[6:30] build up and instead of letting off the
[6:32] pressure in the presence of the Lord,
[6:33] they let it build up where where the
[6:35] devil wants to use that now to step in
[6:37] and cause a great big chaos in their
[6:39] life. Aren't you glad we can let off the
[6:41] pressure?
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad we can come into the
[6:43] presence of the Lord? And I'm not just
[6:44] not talking about here twice a week. I'm
[6:46] talking about everywhere we go. He'll
[6:47] never leave us nor forsake us. Amen.
[6:49] That we can let off the pressure. Amen.
[6:51] We can let it off. We don't let need it
[6:52] to build up. We can let off the
[6:54] pressure. Amen. Where God can use these
[6:56] things instead of, you know, because you
[6:58] got to realize, you know, we live in a
[7:00] day where patience is very thin.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; This world is very impatient.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; You know, can you imagine
[7:09] going back a hundred years ago?
[7:12] There's no there's no microwave. There's
[7:14] no instant noodles. There's no Door
[7:17] Dash. There's not all this instant
[7:19] stuff. You know, I was amazed. It was a
[7:21] few months ago. I ordered something
[7:23] online and it was there this you know
[7:24] the I think the next morning it was like
[7:26] within 24 hours. I couldn't believe it.
[7:28] I never experienced that in my life. But
[7:30] it'll become normal. Oh, this thing's
[7:33] been 48 hours. What's going on? This is
[7:35] terrible. You know why? Cuz patience
[7:37] will be start to I pray I never get that
[7:39] way. But you know what I mean. People
[7:40] get this expectation. Why don't I have
[7:42] it right now?
[7:46] You know, you know, once upon a time
[7:47] with the internet, with dialup internet,
[7:50] this is a history lesson. You literally,
[7:52] you know, open a page, you could go make
[7:55] yourself a drink, come back and it's
[7:57] still slowly loading, you know, and that
[8:00] was normal and we accepted it and it was
[8:01] okay. Imagine if it went back to that
[8:03] today. Oh boy, there'd be riots in the
[8:07] street for, you know, cell towers be
[8:09] burning. It be everyone be crazy.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz it's taking so long.
[8:14] Patience is wearing thin.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; But God allows things to happen because
[8:19] he wants patience to rule. He wants the
[8:21] Holy Ghost to take control of our life.
[8:23] And it's through everyday circumstances
[8:25] God wants to develop these things in our
[8:27] lives. You're stuck in traffic.
[8:30] Praise God.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Patience.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the L. Oh, but I'm running late.
[8:35] It's okay. You know, Jesus is I heard
[8:38] brother um brother Chris Andrews say
[8:40] this. You know Jesus is never late. He's
[8:44] right on time. So if Jesus is in you,
[8:47] you're never late cuz he's never late.
[8:51] If you're stuck in traffic, there's a
[8:52] reason,
[8:54] &gt;&gt; right? If you're running late, there is
[8:55] a reason. Maybe it's normally we're the
[8:57] reason, but you know, you just got to
[8:58] let off the pressure. Don't let these
[9:01] first world problems bug us and grind
[9:03] us. Does it really matter?
[9:05] &gt;&gt; So just let God work.
[9:08] We should be the most patient people in
[9:09] all the world.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, but but I'm a from a military
[9:14] background and always on time and all
[9:16] these things. Just let it go.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Island time is good.
[9:23] Don't get so caught up. These things
[9:24] really don't matter.
[9:27] when we're the first moment when these
[9:29] bodies are changed or we we see him as
[9:32] he is and right you know are we really
[9:34] going to think about I was late that day
[9:37] &gt;&gt; are these things really going to come
[9:39] near our thinking but yet it can be this
[9:41] big massive problem in life and we can
[9:44] throw adult tantrums because we're late
[9:46] or someone else is late. I think we
[9:49] should just let these things go. You do
[9:51] your best, you be diligent, all those
[9:52] things, but you know, don't let it it
[9:54] shouldn't be grinding any gears because
[9:56] God is in control. Is everyone with me
[9:58] tonight? Is that okay? Amen. I think we
[10:00] just trust the Lord. Amen. Now, but so
[10:03] we got to be very careful. We don't
[10:04] allow these things become temper fits
[10:08] in any part of our lives.
[10:11] See, Peter would say, "When you fall
[10:14] into uh wherein you greatly rejoice,
[10:18] though now for a season of need be,
[10:20] you're in heaviness and through manifold
[10:21] temptations, that the trial of your
[10:23] faith being much more precious than of
[10:25] gold that perisheth, thou be tried with
[10:27] fire might be found unto praise and
[10:29] honor and glory at the appearing of
[10:30] Jesus Christ." Amen. So, we got to
[10:32] realize that the wounding is for our
[10:34] good. the trial of our faith. I'm kind
[10:37] of bringing this maybe a bit of a broad
[10:38] brush with wounding, but it can be the
[10:40] tri our faith is tried. It comes under
[10:43] pressure. It comes under impact by
[10:45] something. It's good. That's why it says
[10:48] you, you know, you greatly rejoice.
[10:51] You're going through the ringer. Glory.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's hard times. Praise
[10:56] God.
[10:58] If you're not going through a hard time,
[10:59] praise God anyway.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Maybe I pray should just be
[11:03] a constant thing because God's constant
[11:05] in every situation.
[11:07] Amen. It would say in James, "My
[11:09] brethren, count it all joy when you fall
[11:10] into diverse temptations, knowing this
[11:12] that the trying of your faith workketh
[11:14] patience. But let patience have a
[11:16] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[11:18] entire wanting nothing. But if any of
[11:19] you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that
[11:21] giveth to all men libery and abrath not,
[11:24] and it shall be given him." Amen. So we
[11:27] need to count these things all joy. You
[11:29] get wounded. Praise God. God's doing
[11:32] something. Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; God is working something. He wants to
[11:36] show further part of himself that I've
[11:38] never experienced before in my life. He
[11:40] wants to prove himself. There's a big
[11:42] part of his character I say we haven't
[11:44] all really necessarily ex we haven't
[11:47] experienced the full nature of God
[11:49] personally. This is just me. You know,
[11:51] you you go back 10 years ago, what we've
[11:54] been through, what all of us have been
[11:56] through individually. We've been through
[11:58] trials in the last 10 years that we
[11:59] didn't go through or imagine the 10
[12:02] years before.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Right? So, there's been things now that
[12:06] we've gone through that have been kind
[12:07] unique to our own lives that showed a
[12:10] part of God's nature that we've never
[12:12] experienced.
[12:14] Praise the Lord.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's a good thing. That's why
[12:17] these wounds are good. God wants to
[12:18] reveal himself through the wounds.
[12:22] Amen. Now, if we So, I'm just trying to
[12:24] catch up where I am here.
[12:29] Joseph, Joseph could look beyond his
[12:32] wounds.
[12:34] If you look at the life of Joseph, many
[12:36] times we kind of skim over the really
[12:39] the magnitude of what he went through.
[12:41] He was hated by his brethren. His
[12:44] brothers hated him. He, you know,
[12:46] imagine being around every family dinner
[12:48] time. Everyone's just picking on Joseph.
[12:51] snide remarks, tripping him up, being
[12:53] mean, bullying him, rejecting him, you
[12:56] know, not even including him in
[12:58] anything. He was hated without a cause.
[13:00] And it wasn't his doing. It was actually
[13:02] God's doing in his life. God was
[13:04] allowing wounds to come in.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, because he had to be a perfect
[13:07] type of Christ, right? So, so God
[13:10] allowed these wounds. God allowed him to
[13:12] be the favorite son, you know, have a
[13:14] code of many colors. Well, that dude
[13:16] just brought in wounds of jealousy from
[13:17] his brethren, from his brothers, and
[13:20] then he was sold as a slave. Imagine
[13:21] your own brothers throwing you down a
[13:23] pit. And maybe I'm just maybe just to
[13:27] dramatize, but maybe, you know, imagine
[13:29] you're at the bottom of the pit, you're
[13:30] Joseph, and you can you can hear their
[13:32] voices across the top. Let's just kill
[13:34] him. Let's just get rid of him. Well,
[13:36] how are we going to tell dad? We'll just
[13:38] we'll just tear his coat up and put
[13:39] goat's blood and tell him that a wild
[13:41] animal ate him. And you're hearing these
[13:43] things. These are your brothers. And God
[13:45] has promised promised your lineage that
[13:47] that the Messiah is going to come
[13:48] through. You're meant to be a separated
[13:50] people, a holy nation, and look at what
[13:52] your brethren are doing to you, you
[13:54] know. And then, you know, then he hears
[13:55] Reuben, now let's not do that. And then
[13:57] he hears, you know, the Islamite,
[13:59] Ishelite traders come along, you know.
[14:01] Then then he gets hauled out of the pit.
[14:04] He doesn't know what's going to happen.
[14:05] And then these guys tell, "Oh, this
[14:08] guy's just a slave. We'll sell him to
[14:09] you as a slave." Imagine, imagine the
[14:11] emotion that would be running through
[14:12] Joseph's being.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; So you wanted to kill me, but now I'm a
[14:17] slave. I'm less than a human being now.
[14:20] You, my own brothers have done this to
[14:23] me. This is a big wound. This is a big
[14:26] wound. And you know, he goes down to
[14:28] Egypt. He ends up in Piper's house, ends
[14:30] up there, you know, in charge of the
[14:32] whole house. And remember, those dreams
[14:34] that he had were greater than the
[14:36] wounds. The word coming open to him was
[14:38] greater than the wounds, right? Because
[14:40] he had those two dreams that his um
[14:42] family is going to bow down and worship
[14:43] him, follow him, right? But these wounds
[14:46] had come in. God had allowed those
[14:48] wounds cuz God needed him in Egypt.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; He needed him on a certain position that
[14:54] when those dreams came into
[14:55] manifestation, he'd have the character
[14:58] that life
[15:00] would be preserved.
[15:03] You say, "Well, I'm not Joseph." Yeah,
[15:05] but you're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; You got to realize everything you go
[15:10] through is that life will be preserved.
[15:13] Amen. It will preserve someone's life.
[15:15] It'll help somebody. Everyone's
[15:18] testimony is powerful.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will allow you to go through
[15:24] whole kind of things maybe just for one
[15:26] soul. You say, "Well, is it worth it?"
[15:30] It is cuz eternal things can be done.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; You can step because of wounds. You can
[15:35] step into someone else's wounds. Amen.
[15:37] And bring healing and bring deliverance
[15:40] and bring salvation that someone without
[15:42] the wounds couldn't enter in like you
[15:44] can. You're like, "Brother Brown, I've
[15:46] known I've not said, you know, said
[15:48] these things before that, but you know,
[15:49] like you're like with the prophet,
[15:51] there's Sharon Rose dying her eyes
[15:54] crossed of pain as a little baby dies."
[15:56] And you know, God God was allowing those
[15:58] things to happen. Satan tried to climb
[16:01] into those wounds. tried to make it
[16:03] well. He tried to commit suicide twice,
[16:06] right? But then after after he came
[16:08] through that great trial and then you
[16:10] know you know then the ministry went
[16:13] worldwide and people would bring their
[16:15] crosseyed children across the platform
[16:18] and brother Ram said those people did
[16:20] not know what I went through when I was
[16:22] young having Sharon Rose die with cross
[16:25] crossed eyes. But he said because of
[16:27] that, every child with cross eyes that
[16:29] came across the platform went with
[16:31] straight eyes
[16:32] &gt;&gt; because because of his wounding, he
[16:34] could step into their wounding.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why every testimony is
[16:39] powerful.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you can step. You say, "Well,
[16:42] God hasn't really done too much for me."
[16:44] God's done a lot.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; All of our lives have had purpose.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just wandering around. You ain't
[16:49] wandering.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the righteous are
[16:52] ordered of the Lord. And God's been
[16:54] developing a character that in time of
[16:56] need, you can step in, that life could
[16:58] be preserved.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because you know,
[17:03] if no one's been through what other
[17:04] people have been through, we can maybe
[17:06] sympathize. We can have a real But
[17:08] someone who's been through it can really
[17:10] have that feeling.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And really pray for those people
[17:13] more than anyone else can. So you see
[17:15] his wounding, he could look beyond the
[17:17] wounds because he realized the wounding
[17:20] was all part of the plan for his life.
[17:24] Same thing with you and I.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That life would be
[17:29] preserved.
[17:31] Amen.
[17:33] Now, I feel like I'm running out of
[17:35] time, but we're going to speed up a bit
[17:36] here.
[17:40] Brother man speaks about this statue of
[17:41] the perfect man. I think I took the uh
[17:43] some of these before, but I just want to
[17:44] kind of just go into temperance a little
[17:46] bit because temperance is such an, you
[17:49] know, temperance is self-control
[17:51] and it's a very important thing. It's
[17:53] part of being a complete Christian,
[17:55] right? We know if you have the Holy
[17:58] Ghost, you have all the virtues in you,
[17:59] right? But temperance is such a powerful
[18:02] thing. See, he says, "Add temperance to
[18:05] it." Oh, temperance, how to answer in
[18:08] kindness when wrath is spoke to you.
[18:11] Amen. Somebody somebody say you bunch of
[18:13] holy rollers down there don't jump up
[18:14] and roll up your sleeves now see don't
[18:16] do that but talk with godly love
[18:18] temperance kindness is that the way you
[18:20] want to be when you're rolled upon roll
[18:24] not back let him be your example I mean
[18:26] when they said if thou be the son of God
[18:28] turn those stones into bread he could
[18:30] have done it and showed he was God but
[18:32] he had temperance
[18:34] amen he could look beyond their wounding
[18:36] of their words and he saw their need we
[18:40] do the name
[18:42] &gt;&gt; with people in our lives. They start
[18:44] attacking, guns blazing, whatever it is,
[18:46] misunderstandings just erupt into some
[18:48] big thing. Do we have the temperance to
[18:50] to to to give a soft answer that turns
[18:52] away wrath? Can we look beyond what's
[18:56] coming at us and and and see the need of
[18:58] that person?
[19:01] Amen. You say, so so when your knowledge
[19:03] is like his knowledge, I come to do thy
[19:05] will, oh God. See, with the father's
[19:07] word, he defeated every devil. Heavens
[19:09] and earth will pass away, but the word
[19:10] will not. See, when you get that kind of
[19:12] knowledge, it'll vulcanize with your
[19:13] faith. Then when you get that right kind
[19:15] of temperance like he had, it'll
[19:17] vulcanize. If you had haven't, just like
[19:19] a man-made halfway sousted up belief or
[19:21] temperance, oh, I ought to slap him
[19:23] down, but maybe I better not cuz they
[19:25] might put my name in the paper about it.
[19:27] That ain't the right kind of temperance
[19:28] he's talking about. So, it's not have a
[19:31] temperance of I better not say something
[19:32] cuz I'll look bad. That's not the right
[19:35] kind of temperance. Don't try and add
[19:37] that. It won't work. But when you can
[19:38] really with the sweetness in your heart,
[19:40] forgive every man, hold your peace, let
[19:43] it be gone. See, then it'll vulcanize.
[19:45] You can add that to your faith.
[19:47] Amen. Why is that? Because you realize
[19:50] this person is no doubt probably
[19:52] responding out of wounds,
[19:54] right? And the enemy's got into that
[19:56] wound and now this is this, you can say
[19:58] this infection is coming through. And if
[20:01] you can look beyond his wound and see
[20:03] his need, then you can really with
[20:05] sweetness from your heart forgive every
[20:07] man. Really, the only people who can
[20:09] forgive upon the earth are Holy Ghost
[20:10] fil people.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Only true forgiveness can can come from
[20:14] God.
[20:16] Amen.
[20:18] Now, wounds can wounds can um
[20:22] infected wounds can come out in many
[20:24] different ways. Now, I shared this um
[20:26] well, the first part of this anyway um a
[20:28] while ago, but I just want to focus in
[20:31] on the yellow bit that I put there. It
[20:34] says, "Now consider thyself least, thou
[20:36] also be tempted." So, to restore a man
[20:38] who's overcome a fault, you know, those
[20:40] who are spiritual, restore such one in
[20:42] the spirit of meekness, considering
[20:44] thyself least, thou also be tempted.
[20:46] It's amazing what happens when people
[20:49] will will will cast judgment and and and
[20:52] drag someone down and murder someone's
[20:54] character and and find fault in people
[20:57] and the things that they find fault in
[20:59] others, they end up manifesting in a
[21:01] greater way. Amen. I've seen it. I've
[21:04] seen it among believers. People come in,
[21:06] they criticize some family, some person
[21:09] going through something and the next
[21:10] thing you know, you see them going
[21:11] through the same thing because what's
[21:13] happened now is because they are not
[21:15] coming in the spirit of meekness
[21:17] &gt;&gt; and they're not even interested in
[21:18] restoring that person anyway. They want
[21:20] to see that person pushed down to show
[21:22] really how unspiritual that they are.
[21:24] Then what happens is that same person
[21:26] does the same thing.
[21:29] I've seen it. I'm sure we've all seen
[21:30] it.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. someone who comes in, some sister
[21:33] comes in and complains about some sister
[21:35] who's halfway in with a splitter on a
[21:37] dress and says it's wrong and all these
[21:39] things and and then drags the deacons
[21:40] into every problem that goes on in life
[21:42] and then they end up wearing worse
[21:44] dresses than them. Why? Because they're
[21:47] actually the judgment that they measure
[21:48] out is given to them
[21:50] &gt;&gt; whether they uh realize it or not. You
[21:53] know, it's the same thing, you know,
[21:54] where where where people, you know,
[21:56] people have a disagreement with a
[21:57] brother or sister instead of going and
[21:59] talking to them about it. I mean, let's
[22:02] be honest. Are we not all Christians?
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Are we not all on the same team? Are are
[22:08] we not all friends?
[22:11] &gt;&gt; So, friends can talk about things,
[22:14] right? Friends can and and aren't we
[22:16] more than friends, but family?
[22:18] &gt;&gt; So, then why now? Now this is no one
[22:20] here but I'm using using this as a real
[22:22] example I've seen as someone have a
[22:24] disagreement with someone instead of
[22:26] talking to that person they drag the
[22:27] deacons in they drag myself in and
[22:30] instead of talking to that person that's
[22:32] not even a thing that even matters but
[22:34] instead of you know talking to that that
[22:36] person about it they will try and use
[22:39] the offices of deacon and pastor to to
[22:42] be like heavies to come in and be on
[22:43] their side that's not even scripturally
[22:45] way of addressing things the first step
[22:48] is go talk to the person.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; It's not drag everyone into it and make
[22:53] it a big thing.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; We're not here to do people's bidding or
[22:56] or carnal people's bidding. We're here
[22:58] to do the bidding of the Lord.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we got to be very careful of
[23:01] things. You know, people have said, you
[23:03] know, you before they have children.
[23:04] Famous last words. Now, here's advice to
[23:07] all pe all young people who are don't
[23:09] have children or unmarried, want to get
[23:12] married. Okay, I'm I'm I'm I I sure you
[23:15] all want to have kids who don't have
[23:16] kids.
[23:18] Never ever say these words. When I have
[23:21] kids, my kids will not be like X, Y, and
[23:23] Zed.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Because you are setting yourself up that
[23:28] your kids will be worse than those kids
[23:30] you are finding fault with. I've seen
[23:32] it. I've seen a sister say, "Well, my
[23:34] kid, when I was young, we all sat on a
[23:36] bench and we didn't say nothing and
[23:37] there was five of us and they can't
[23:39] control their children and their
[23:40] children are a million times worse than
[23:42] any kids here."
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz the judgment you give out, you
[23:47] receive.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; So don't ever give marriage advice.
[23:51] Don't ever give parenting advice.
[23:54] I mean, do it in a right spirit if you
[23:56] do.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Okay? Don't come in a spirit of
[23:59] meekness. So, actually, I take that
[24:01] back. Give advice if you feel to. But in
[24:03] meekness, don't come up in it. Well, I
[24:05] know everything.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Because honestly, I've seen it time and
[24:10] time again. People give out this advice
[24:13] and they end up eating their words
[24:15] &gt;&gt; because their own children are God's
[24:17] agents in their life. Hallelujah. And
[24:20] they are 10 times worse than whatever
[24:21] they're criticizing people for.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's a very interesting thing.
[24:28] So, okay, we're all good. log that way
[24:30] for later.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; It's important. You'll save yourself a
[24:33] world of trouble.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, how we going
[24:39] for time? We got a bit of time. Okay.
[24:43] Wait, hold on. Just want to make a bit
[24:44] of a bit of a shift here.
[24:49] Now, the thing is, as I said about the
[24:52] Lord, his wounds are different. They
[24:55] brought healing. They brought life.
[24:57] Satan's wounds just bring death. Okay.
[25:00] And it's the same thing with you and I.
[25:02] A Christian is built different. Not
[25:05] because of upbringing, not because of
[25:07] culture, not because of their family
[25:09] structure, but because of the baptism of
[25:12] the Holy Ghost, that makes us different.
[25:14] The new birth solves every problem. Will
[25:17] we have struggles? Yes. But when you
[25:18] receive him, you you receive the one who
[25:21] has overcome all things. And you receive
[25:25] that power that can overcome all things
[25:27] that come into your life. Amen.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a different force in you
[25:32] that the world doesn't have. Amen.
[25:34] Because you have the creator of heavens
[25:35] and earth dwelling in you. Deity is in
[25:37] you. Right. So you have a power within
[25:40] you that can overcome all things.
[25:42] Remember the Lord Jesus overcame all
[25:44] things. Every enemy that can be named,
[25:47] he conquered it. Okay? So never think
[25:49] you're facing an enemy he hasn't faced.
[25:51] He faced it all and overcome it all. He
[25:53] was tempted by everything and he
[25:55] overcame that temptation. Amen. and he
[25:57] is interceding on your behalf actively
[25:59] right now. Amen. He's in your corner.
[26:03] Praise the Lord. So now a believer has
[26:07] something in us that can deal with
[26:08] wounds. It's like having the magic
[26:11] medicine.
[26:13] Praise the Lord.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Right in our spirit, we have something
[26:17] the balm of Gilead, that healing virtue
[26:19] of God himself. Amen. The love of God,
[26:22] God is love within our soul, that can
[26:24] actually come forth into our spirit and
[26:27] bring healing. Amen. Where someone else
[26:30] can be wounded in their spirit the same
[26:31] way as you, but by God's grace that can
[26:34] turn into a testimony instead of staying
[26:36] as bitterness, right? It can, you know,
[26:39] sure there's pain, sure there's hurt,
[26:40] there's resentment, there's questions.
[26:42] But when when the Lord, when you give
[26:44] that to the Lord, he takes those things
[26:46] and he brings healing into it. Amen. He
[26:48] takes those questions and he just brings
[26:50] a he just brings the right answer. As I
[26:53] said, he may not tell you all the
[26:54] details, but he give you the right
[26:55] answer. You feel resentment. Then what
[26:57] happens? You take that to the Lord and
[26:58] you feel love for that person who did
[27:00] it. Amen. You feel bitter. He just makes
[27:03] it sweet somehow. Just like when the
[27:06] children of Israel, they left the Red
[27:07] Sea, they're journeying three three days
[27:09] into the desert. They came to a place of
[27:11] bitter waters, a bitter experience,
[27:13] right? In their walk, they just had
[27:15] victory. They were from victory to
[27:16] bitterness in a few days and they're all
[27:19] complaining about this bitter time and
[27:20] God inspires Moses to cut down a certain
[27:23] tree and put it into that bitter water
[27:25] and it became sweet. Amen. And that tree
[27:27] is still here in existence. It is the
[27:29] cross of Calvary. I tell you what, you
[27:31] take any bitter thing, it will heal it
[27:34] and make it sweet.
[27:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we have
[27:38] something different that the world
[27:40] doesn't have, but it needs, which is God
[27:43] himself.
[27:45] Amen.
[27:46] Now, this means that we can we can see
[27:51] we can see Christ.
[27:54] We can see the mystery of godliness.
[27:57] We can see the mystery of God. Okay,
[27:59] this is this is what happens is people
[28:01] who don't know the Lord can only see
[28:03] carnal things. They can only see
[28:05] natural. So, so for example, if I don't
[28:07] know the Lord, then I'll just see I'll
[28:10] just respond in a natural way, which is
[28:13] normally eye for an eye, tooth for a
[28:14] tooth, hold a grudge, make a wall, cut
[28:16] ties, that's it. Right? But if I know
[28:19] the Lord, I can look beyond those things
[28:22] and I can intercede and pray and believe
[28:25] that the love of God is going to bring
[28:27] healing to myself and also to that
[28:29] person. There's going to be a
[28:30] reconciliation take place because he is
[28:32] in my life. It's not me doing it. It's
[28:34] he. It's him within me. Are we all
[28:36] together tonight? We got to realize we
[28:38] have a bomb. We have the cure all. Amen.
[28:41] We have the cure all. So now we
[28:44] understand the mystery of God that God
[28:46] is manifested in the flesh, right? He's
[28:48] manifested in flesh, but now he's
[28:50] manifested in your flesh.
[28:53] And now if he is now, we can see
[28:57] we have these virtues built within us.
[28:59] But then I just want to come down to the
[29:01] where I put in yellow. So he says, "But
[29:02] he that lackth these things is blind and
[29:05] cannot see a far off." Now the words
[29:07] cannot see a far off is actually one
[29:09] Greek word. It actually means you cannot
[29:12] see the mystery of God. Your eyes are
[29:14] blind to the mystery. God becoming
[29:17] flesh.
[29:18] Amen. So, so if you have these virtues,
[29:21] if you have Christ in you, which gives
[29:22] you these virtues, then you can see a
[29:24] far off. You can look beyond the wound.
[29:27] You can look beyond the pain. You can
[29:29] see and then what do you see? You see
[29:30] the mystery of redemption where God has
[29:34] come and dwelt in our lives to finish
[29:36] his plan of redemption.
[29:38] Amen. We can see a far off. We can look
[29:41] beyond like Joseph could look he got to
[29:43] a point in his life he looked beyond the
[29:46] painful memories of rejection, hurt, and
[29:47] being sold as a slave. He could look
[29:49] beyond those things because actually
[29:51] realized I'm part of the mystery of God
[29:53] unfolding. My life is actually a
[29:55] manifestation, a prophecy of God's plan
[29:58] of redemption. Because we know Joseph's
[30:00] life encompassed the whole work of
[30:02] redemption because when he's in uh when
[30:04] he's in Egypt, he takes a gentile bride,
[30:06] right? And then when his brethren come
[30:09] back, he gets everyone from him from the
[30:11] palace. Then he reveals himself to his
[30:13] brethren. So where's his gentile bride?
[30:15] Away from him. So where do we go when he
[30:17] comes to reveal himself to the Jews?
[30:18] We're at the wedding supper in the sky.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the whole plan of redemption is
[30:22] encompassed in Joseph's life. He's
[30:24] living out a mystery.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the same thing with us. We're
[30:27] living out redemption. It's more than
[30:30] just a doctrine or more than just a
[30:32] church though. It's it's redemption
[30:34] being manifested. Yeah. Because why? We
[30:36] are the beneficiaries of God's great
[30:38] plan of redemption. God found you in the
[30:40] mud, picked you up. Amen. Cleansed you,
[30:43] washed you, put you on the table, filled
[30:46] you with his presence, and set you in
[30:48] that now you're in service. Amen. That
[30:50] what? You can go and you can find others
[30:52] that are tied to him. Part of the great
[30:54] plan of God's redemption.
[30:57] I mean, you see the scribes and
[30:59] Pharisees, they could not see a far off.
[31:01] They were blind to God's mystery that,
[31:03] you know, Christ was here to redeem the
[31:05] world. That's why they would say, "If
[31:07] thou be the son of God, come down from
[31:09] the cross." They weren't sure. You see,
[31:11] and the devil made the devil's made a
[31:12] lot of blunders in his life, if I can
[31:14] say, it's his life. He's made so many
[31:16] blunders. And and this was his biggest
[31:18] blunder because if he knew who was
[31:21] there, he would never have crucified him
[31:23] because because he thought the devil cuz
[31:26] he just thought connly wounding of him
[31:28] will kill him. But actually his wounding
[31:32] of him brought life.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was wounded that you'd be
[31:36] healed. Amen. He gave his life that you
[31:39] would be saved. Amen. He went to hell
[31:41] that you don't need to go to hell. Amen.
[31:44] He carried your sins far away. Praise
[31:46] the Lord.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so they did not understand
[31:49] this whole mystery. So, if they really
[31:51] knew, if they really knew this mystery
[31:54] of God, they would never have crucified
[31:56] the Lord of glory.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] But you see now
[32:03] our wounds, God wants to use our wounds.
[32:07] God uses our wounds to bring us to a
[32:09] position.
[32:11] But does he really? Yeah, he does. This
[32:13] is Esther.
[32:15] Esther was an orphan girl. That's a big
[32:18] wound.
[32:20] I was blessed enough to to to to have
[32:22] both parents in the same house growing
[32:24] up. They're still together. Thank the
[32:26] Lord. Right. And my my my mom's parents
[32:30] were next door to us growing up and also
[32:32] my great uncle. So, I had I had I had a
[32:35] wonderful family circle around me
[32:36] growing up. So, I don't know what it's
[32:38] like to not have a mama or a dad or be
[32:39] an orphan, but it's a big hole. God can
[32:42] fill that hole, right? God is father to
[32:45] the fatherless, right? But you see now
[32:48] she was so this wound came into her life
[32:50] where she was an orphan. But God
[32:53] allowed, you know, isn't it amazing? God
[32:56] allowed Israel to fall in idolatry. You
[32:58] got to look at the domino effect to get
[33:00] Esther here. It's a big domino effect,
[33:03] right? It started off with with the
[33:05] split of the kingdoms with the son of
[33:07] Solomon and you know Jeroboam and
[33:09] Riaboam. Jeroboam made the two golden
[33:11] calves. Idolatry came in. All there's a
[33:14] domino effect starting to come. But the
[33:16] whole reason God allowed it is because a
[33:18] son of Aag and Amalachite had to be
[33:21] taken care of. This is this is Hmon. He
[33:23] was the Agite, the son of, you know,
[33:25] he's an Amalachite, the ancient enemy of
[33:27] the Jews, right? So now God allows this
[33:29] domino effect to come that finally we
[33:31] have this scene hundreds of years later.
[33:34] But you see her wounding caused her to
[33:37] be raised in Shusham. Her wounding
[33:39] caused her to be an orphan. Her wounding
[33:42] caused her to be there and then be
[33:44] picked. Wasn't married for whatever
[33:46] reason. We don't know, right? But God
[33:48] allowed all that to happen that she
[33:50] would end up in this position as queen
[33:53] of of of the superpower of the age. And
[33:56] she was carrying this secret of her
[33:59] identity.
[34:01] I am the bride. I'm the queen. The king
[34:05] by his grace has placed me in this
[34:06] position. We're carrying this mystery,
[34:08] too. The devil looks at you and can't
[34:11] quite see it, just like he couldn't
[34:12] quite see our Lord Jesus on the cross
[34:15] being the Messiah himself. But he is
[34:17] carrying the mystery of redemption. And
[34:20] then here, here comes Esther. She's
[34:22] carrying this mystery. This is what to
[34:23] me is so beautiful about the message. It
[34:25] reveals who God is. It reveals who you
[34:28] are. It also reveals who Satan is.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Right? And so now here is here is
[34:33] Esther. This is at the second banquet of
[34:35] wines. And between the first and second
[34:37] banquet, the king can't sleep. And the
[34:39] book comes open. The record comes open
[34:41] about Mori saving the king's life. So
[34:43] what happens? The seals come off the
[34:45] book. And then and then when the seals
[34:47] come off the book, there's a whole role
[34:48] reversal goes on because in the
[34:51] beginning of this whole scene, the Jews
[34:52] are under a death sentence. But at the
[34:55] end of it, after the book comes open,
[34:56] Hmon's under the death sentence.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the book comes open. Esther
[35:02] stands in her God-given position
[35:04] carrying this mystery. Heymon, I know
[35:06] who you are. You're an Amalachite.
[35:08] You're my enemy. Isn't it amazing? She
[35:10] came out of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul
[35:12] was out of the tribe of Benjamin. King
[35:13] Saul. Saul did not finish the job like
[35:16] he was told to. So God raised up someone
[35:18] of that same tribe to break that stigma
[35:20] and finish the job.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like many things in our lives
[35:24] from our forebears, they could not
[35:25] overcome. But God raises you up. Amen.
[35:27] To break that thing. Amen. that you
[35:29] would stand on its head and prove Satan,
[35:32] you put this in my lineage, but I'm
[35:34] going to finish it by the power of God.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there she is. She's carrying
[35:39] the secret. The king doesn't know who
[35:41] she is. Oh, she's Esther, a star. She
[35:44] was more than that. She was Hadassa one
[35:48] hidden. I think it means star. Esther
[35:50] means star, right? And then so finally,
[35:52] now she's carrying this mystery. I know
[35:53] who my enemy is. I know who I am. And
[35:56] then she reveals the whole thing to the
[35:58] king in order to turn the wrath of the
[36:01] king against Hmon.
[36:03] Praise the Lord. And then he his whole
[36:05] scheme of making the gallows against
[36:07] Mori. He hangs on his own scheme. He
[36:09] hangs on his own gallows. He's lifted up
[36:11] high. And then now what's happens? The
[36:13] signant ring that that that Hmon was
[36:16] given by the king is now in Esther's
[36:17] hand. And she has the authority and
[36:19] power to write a new law which overcomes
[36:21] what Hmon has already given.
[36:24] Amen. All because of wounds.
[36:28] She ended up there because of w I know
[36:30] there's probably a small you got to look
[36:31] at the magnitude of her life. Maybe just
[36:33] go think about these things. But God
[36:35] allowed those wounds to get her there
[36:38] that salvation would come to her people.
[36:41] Life would be preserved.
[36:43] And I'm going to close with that. How
[36:46] much you and I you say well I don't
[36:47] understand my life. We don't necessarily
[36:50] need to understand everything that
[36:51] happened in our life but we need to come
[36:53] to a peace in our hearts. God, you've
[36:55] allowed it that life would be preserved.
[36:57] That you can take these wounds, Lord,
[36:59] and manifest yourself through them. That
[37:01] they're a testimony now that they can
[37:02] help someone else.
[37:05] Amen. So, thank God for the wounds.
[37:08] Amen. Thank God. Lord, you want to prove
[37:11] yourself in the wounding. No one likes
[37:14] pain, but we got to count it all joy.
[37:17] There's a purpose in the pain. There's a
[37:19] purpose in the wounding. Can we have the
[37:21] musicians, please? Um, tonight I'll
[37:23] finish there. I've been a bit long.
[37:24] Sorry.
[37:28] But praise God.
[37:34] Amen.
[37:36] Thank you, Lord. All things are working
[37:38] together for good for those that love
[37:41] God and are called according to his
[37:43] purpose. I believe I'm looking at people
[37:48] that scripture very much applies to.
[37:51] You love the Lord and you're called.
[37:54] You're called according to his purpose.
[37:58] Do I have that? I just want to put that
[37:59] up. I think I have it. Maybe. Here we
[38:01] go.
[38:04] Yeah. We're called according to his
[38:06] purpose. We're not called to our purpose
[38:08] or whatever. No, he called us according
[38:10] to his purpose as the bride of Jesus
[38:13] Christ in this end time.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; So, everything's working together for
[38:16] good. You say, "I don't know what I've
[38:18] been through." I mean, you don't know
[38:20] what I've been through. I don't.
[38:22] But this scripture applies to everyone.
[38:25] I know it applies to me.
[38:28] Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; We say, "Lord, you know what you're
[38:31] doing." Maybe let's sing that song. Let
[38:35] Oh, let's stand, shall we? No, I think I
[38:36] have another song I'd like to sing. Oh,
[38:38] yeah. Turning graves into gardens.
[38:42] Amen. He sure does that.
[38:45] Amen. So, thank you, Lord, for the
[38:47] wounding. Thank you, Lord, for what
[38:48] you've brought us through, what you're
[38:50] taking us through. Lord, it's working
[38:51] for our good cuz he wants to prove
[38:53] himself in everything.
[38:58] Amen.
[38:59] Amen. Let's sing this, shall we? Amen.
[39:05] I searched the world,
[39:10] but it couldn't fill me.
[39:15] Oh, man's empty praise and treasures and
[39:19] faith are never enough.
[39:25] Oh, then you came along
[39:30] and put me back together.
[39:35] And every desire is now satisfied
[39:41] here in your love.
[39:46] Oh, there's nothing
[39:50] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[39:55] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[40:00] nothing is better than you.
[40:06] I'm not afraid
[40:11] to show you my weakness,
[40:16] my failures and flaws. Lord, you've seen
[40:19] them all and you still call me friend.
[40:26] Because God of the mountain
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] is God of the valley.
[40:34] [Music]
[40:36] Oh, there's not a place your mercy and
[40:40] grace won't find me again.
[40:44] [Music]
[40:46] Oh, hallelujah.
[40:47] Lord, there's nothing
[40:51] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[40:56] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[41:01] nothing is better than you.
[41:08] Lord, there's nothing
[41:11] better than you. Lord, there's nothing
[41:16] better than you. Lord, there's nothing
[41:21] nothing is better than you.
[41:26] Amen.
[41:29] You turn mourning to dancing.
[41:34] You give beauty for ashes.
[41:39] You turn shame into glory.
[41:43] You're the only one who cares.
[41:49] You turn graves into godens.
[41:54] You turn bones into armies.
[41:59] You turn seas into highways.
[42:03] You're the only one who cares.
[42:11] Oh, there's nothing
[42:14] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[42:19] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[42:24] nothing is better than you,
[42:29] [Music]
[42:32] Lord. There's nothing
[42:35] better than you. Lord, there's nothing
[42:41] better than you. Lord, there's nothing
[42:46] nothing is better than you.
[42:52] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's pray. Be
[42:55] thankful for the Thank you for the
[42:57] wounds, Lord Jesus. Thank you, dear God.
[43:00] First, we want to thank you for your
[43:01] wounds, Lord. Your wounds bring brought
[43:03] eternal life to us. We're so thankful,
[43:06] dear God. You are wounded for our
[43:07] transgressions. The chastisement of our
[43:10] peace was upon you and by your stripes
[43:11] we are healed. Oh Lord you're mad more
[43:14] than any other man that eternal life
[43:16] could be released Lord unto us. We want
[43:19] to thank you for that so much. Thank you
[43:21] dear God that you bruised the head of
[43:23] the seed of the serpent that day on
[43:25] Calvary. And dear God we also want to
[43:27] thank you Lord for the wounds that are
[43:29] in our lives. Lord we do count it all
[43:30] joy when we come and fall into diverous
[43:33] temptations. as we go through fiery
[43:35] trials. Lord, we want to thank you for
[43:37] these things because we know during
[43:39] these times, you want to prove your
[43:40] word, Lord. You want to step into the
[43:42] wounds and prove yourself, show yourself
[43:44] alive and well, that you're the same
[43:46] yesterday, today, and forever. So, I
[43:48] pray, dear God, that whatever's go,
[43:50] Lord, we're going through in life, may
[43:52] we not allow the enemy to come in and
[43:54] try and try and poison those wounds to
[43:57] make us bitter and doubtful and down and
[44:00] depressed. Lord Jesus, I pray dear God
[44:02] that all of us here, those who may be
[44:04] watching, Lord, I pray there'd be such a
[44:06] joy in our lives, Lord. The joy of the
[44:08] Lord, Father, Lord, far beyond what
[44:11] circumstances we're going through,
[44:12] Father. But Lord, may it be your joy,
[44:14] the joy of your salvation, Lord. May it
[44:16] overflow us. I pray, dear God, and may
[44:19] we just praise you for every moment,
[44:20] Lord, knowing that, Lord, there's a
[44:22] purpose for everything we go through in
[44:24] life. Like Joseph went through many
[44:25] different things, but it's that life
[44:27] would be preserved, dear God. And
[44:29] father, may we see that that Lord, we
[44:31] have all had different paths, unique
[44:33] journeys you've brought us through. But
[44:35] Father, may we see that all those
[44:36] things, Lord, that you you've allowed
[44:38] that life can be preserved. Maybe
[44:40] someone who's walking the path that
[44:41] we've already walked through, we can
[44:43] enter into their needs and pray for them
[44:44] and intercede and put an arm over their
[44:46] shoulder and say, "We understand what
[44:48] you're going through cuz the Lord has
[44:49] brought us through." Grant it, dear God.
[44:51] I pray you bless each one here. May you
[44:53] dismiss us with your blessing now. We
[44:55] love you so much and thank you, Lord.
[44:56] And truly, there's no one like you, oh
[44:58] God, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[45:02] God bless you, friends. Amen. Sing us a
[45:05] song, bro.
