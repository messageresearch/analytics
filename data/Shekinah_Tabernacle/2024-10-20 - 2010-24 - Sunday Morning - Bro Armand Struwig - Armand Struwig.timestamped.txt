[40:09] musicians usually I let the musicians
[40:11] sit and you all stand for some reason I
[40:12] don't know why do that such emotional
[40:15] service I'm so so sorry I couldn't keep
[40:17] it together I was sitting there at the
[40:19] back and it's all J's fault he started
[40:21] picking the
[40:23] songs and then Sister Barbara was
[40:25] entering in and I just thought you know
[40:27] what a mighty God we
[40:29] serve that that no matter where we are
[40:32] he's there with us and uh so I'm going
[40:34] to share a little bit of of a couple of
[40:37] photos with you but first what I want to
[40:39] do is I think because we're not didn't
[40:41] go into the service we we'll go into the
[40:42] service officially so we'll maybe just
[40:44] make a time for testimonies and um if
[40:47] you feel led to say something this is
[40:50] your time but before we do it if we all
[40:51] can just stand up I just want to open
[40:53] the word today and so we all do it in
[40:56] the presence of Our Lord
[40:58] um because I think it's right let's go
[40:59] to the Book of Joshua and we go to
[41:01] Joshua 1 now this is not my service
[41:03] there my sermon um but it is part of it
[41:07] so this was not my opening scripture but
[41:09] I thought I'll just put it in there and
[41:11] we're going to start there from verse
[41:14] number
[41:15] three oh actually we can we can yeah
[41:17] let's start from verse number
[41:21] two uh chapter one Joshua chapter 1 and
[41:25] for you Bible scholars there's no first
[41:27] Joshua second Joshua there just Joshua
[41:30] yeah he didn't have to do it once twice
[41:32] he did it once and he just done it so it
[41:34] says
[41:36] there every place that the soul of thy
[41:39] foot shall tread upon I have given unto
[41:41] you as I said unto Moses every place
[41:45] that thy soul of thy foot shall tread
[41:47] upon that I have given unto you as I
[41:50] said unto Moses for the
[41:53] Wilderness um this Lebanon even unto the
[41:56] great Riv River the river e frates all
[41:59] the land of the Hittites and unto the
[42:00] great sea towards the going down of the
[42:02] sun shall be your Coast there shall not
[42:06] any man be able to stand before thee all
[42:09] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[42:12] so shall I be with thee I will not fail
[42:15] thee nor forsake thee um let's just pray
[42:19] Lord Jesus as we open the Service we're
[42:21] going to share some testimonies Lord but
[42:23] there's no point opening this Bible Lord
[42:25] and not inviting you here Lord you only
[42:27] can reveal this Bible to us Lord and
[42:30] reveal the heart of God Lord in our
[42:32] situation I just pray Lord that you'll
[42:34] just take the scripture May the blessing
[42:37] be upon your word Lord and may it fall
[42:38] on prepared ground in Jesus Christ's
[42:40] name we pray amen amen so now I want to

[50:22] desire was if you come to New Zealand we
[50:25] need a church because we we are from
[50:28] Nairobi church so we tried to look
[50:32] around we saw different churches
[50:35] wanganui was always coming first so when
[50:39] we finally decided that we coming to
[50:42] Wellington so we searched we saw
[50:45] shakina
[50:47] so the first Sunday we were very tired
[50:50] we could not make it then the second one
[50:53] we came in and we were saying we just go
[50:55] and see we are not sure if we stay
[50:59] because we we are looking for a real
[51:02] Church where we can feed from his table
[51:06] but uh when we came in we did not have
[51:09] any doubt from there on end forth this
[51:12] became our church amen we really thank
[51:15] God the first year was very difficult
[51:17] for us looking for jobs and all
[51:20] everything in happens when you move to a
[51:23] new country but through the prayers we
[51:26] we always came in and we got the prayers
[51:28] and all our needs were answered we
[51:31] really thank God for all the Believers
[51:34] this it has been really a wonderful
[51:35] place I really last Sunday Joan was
[51:39] telling me when we were going
[51:41] out you mean we are not going to come
[51:43] back here next Sunday will be our last
[51:45] Sunday I told him yes then he said no I
[51:50] love this place what do you mean now we
[51:52] not be coming here on
[51:54] Sundays so it has been really wonderful
[51:57] for all everyone including the young
[51:59] ones and we thank God for it God bless
[52:07] [Applause]

[52:13] you up here right God bless you um
[52:17] Shalom
[52:18] Saints um if I don't speak the rocks are
[52:23] going to speak
[52:25] and um
[52:27] I'm not going to allow the stones and
[52:30] rocks to praise and um speak about the
[52:34] greatness of God while I can be able to
[52:40] speak it's almost two years for us we
[52:44] came here I think on the 28th of October
[52:48] so we sort of couple of days from our
[52:51] second year anniversary
[53:00] I met sister
[53:01] Priscilla in South Africa no I haven't
[53:05] met her in South Africa she was given a
[53:08] name and she loved the name before
[53:10] seeing the
[53:12] face
[53:16] she made sure that I don't know how that
[53:21] I'm catered
[53:23] For that's why I'm saying I met her in
[53:25] South Africa magically in New
[53:29] Zealand Sister Christine already I'm in
[53:32] South Africa I don't know her I don't
[53:35] even want to know her because my
[53:37] thinking when I leave was that when I
[53:40] get there I'll meet everybody I got
[53:42] sister Priscilla's number while in South
[53:44] Africa from her friend called sister
[53:46] Tanya and I'm like I'm not going to call
[53:49] her up until I get there so let me get
[53:52] there then all the arrangements will be
[53:54] done but she's like I'm not having any
[53:56] of that Tanya give me her number before
[54:00] I know it um I get a call from Sister
[54:03] Christine like oh my God what has she
[54:07] done um before I know it I know of
[54:11] sister Lani in Oakland that I have never
[54:13] even met before I know it I know Sister
[54:15] Tei I'm talking to Sister Tei she's
[54:18] giving me
[54:20] encouragement she has never even seen me
[54:22] because we had issues of the Visas and
[54:24] all those things she's talking to me
[54:27] like she has seen
[54:28] me I come here I have a car I come here
[54:32] I've got a place to stay I come here
[54:35] I've got furnisher a house fully
[54:38] furnished I've got plates I've got
[54:40] fridges everything that you can think
[54:44] of um and I think I have said Thank you
[54:48] sometime last year but I don't think I
[54:50] did Justice to it I'm going to do it
[54:53] again and
[54:55] say the God that we serve is
[55:00] unlimited um when you are in the message
[55:03] you think that you have reached
[55:07] it I am here in Shak I know that I
[55:10] haven't reached it I came to this
[55:14] service and service after service is you
[55:18] can make it you are stronger than what
[55:21] you think you are that has been the the
[55:25] message for me through out all the
[55:27] services this is the service where
[55:30] somehow I believe that Pastor
[55:33] Ben is outside my house all the time
[55:37] listening to our
[55:41] conversations seeing everything that is
[55:43] happening in my house because something
[55:47] happens on Monday I come on Sunday and
[55:49] brother Ben is standing here and talking
[55:51] about exactly the same thing and I'm
[55:54] like this man somehow is if dropping on
[55:57] us it's
[55:59] impossible that he can know what is
[56:03] going
[56:04] on beyond that it is the love from each
[56:08] and every
[56:10] sister there are times where I feel like
[56:13] I'm
[56:14] falling and I just have sisters that I
[56:17] carry
[56:21] me there's one in particular I don't
[56:23] want to mention her name
[56:31] she treats me like a child sometimes
[56:34] when she talks to me she talks to me
[56:36] like I'm a young
[56:40] child but she's got so much respect for
[56:43] me that I also don't understand it's
[56:46] like a paradox how can you speak to me
[56:48] in such a
[56:49] manner but you treat me in such a manner
[56:53] as well and it's the love the respect
[56:57] everything that comes from each and
[56:59] every one of
[57:00] you in the kitchen the
[57:03] fellowship where we fellowshipping over
[57:05] food it's something that is new to some
[57:09] of us we come from various churches in
[57:13] the mes as well the love is just there
[57:16] because the prophet taught us it's about
[57:21] love more than
[57:22] anything and that's what you will get in
[57:25] every every message church that you go
[57:27] to not that we are perfect but that is
[57:29] what you will get but we come here
[57:33] Sunday in Sunday out we come here we eat
[57:37] we Fellowship we get to know sister how
[57:41] was your
[57:43] week and when you can get how was your
[57:47] week that's how you are able to pray
[57:50] specifically because you know how my
[57:53] weak was you don't pray generally that
[57:57] I'm just praying for the sister you are
[58:00] praying specifically to my challenges
[58:02] because I would have told you how my
[58:04] week was and I just also want to
[58:09] encourage that let's talk about our
[58:12] weeks because it's through those
[58:16] conversations that we can fight the
[58:18] battles that are
[58:20] targeted we can know specifically what
[58:24] it is that we are praying for I want to
[58:27] thank um the pastor Sister Christine to
[58:31] thank the deons it's not an easy job
[58:35] sometimes it looks like it's easy we we
[58:36] know that we are very very difficult
[58:39] brother Kuan brother Ed but everything
[58:43] that you are doing you are doing with
[58:45] all smile all the time no matter how

[58:55] brothers and sister sisters shakina is
[58:58] you shakina is in you everything that we
[59:02] want out of this service is in us and we

[1:00:57] uh you know it's it's a bit different
[1:01:00] when you are still
[1:01:02] young because you cannot really look
[1:01:04] much back to see you can only learn from
[1:01:08] others learn from reading the Bible how
[1:01:11] others went through but when you get to
[1:01:13] where I am at the moment I'm 48 and this
[1:01:17] year I attend 48 but I just look back in
[1:01:21] my life from when I was
[1:01:24] small and uh I'm I'm just
[1:01:27] shocked because God knew every moment I
[1:01:31] didn't know he knew every step he knew
[1:01:34] all my weaknesses he knew my the
[1:01:37] pitfalls which I will fall in he knew
[1:01:40] everything and he also knew how he's
[1:01:43] going to deliver me so I just want to
[1:01:46] thank him because you know we come we
[1:01:49] come from a country that is very or used
[1:01:51] to be a hostile probably still is as we
[1:01:55] know every country has got his own
[1:01:57] Spirit allocated demons and chief demons
[1:02:00] so our country beloved mother South
[1:02:02] Africa has got also so I grew
[1:02:06] up hating a white
[1:02:09] man I grew up like that and
[1:02:13] uh so because I I I couldn't faom how
[1:02:18] can you want to treat another human
[1:02:21] being the way you treat and I I didn't
[1:02:23] like that so when the go El started to
[1:02:26] be preached to me that was like now two
[1:02:29] extreme sides that frustrates me let's
[1:02:33] preach this gospel in line with hating
[1:02:36] these
[1:02:37] [Laughter]
[1:02:41] people combined with growing up and the
[1:02:44] challenges of growing up and being a
[1:02:47] teenager then that led me into a wrong
[1:02:51] direction fast forward University life
[1:02:54] was better because I was away from home
[1:02:57] who parents who say this and this and
[1:03:00] very legalistic background and all that
[1:03:02] so University was a first eye opener for
[1:03:04] me my first experience of the Holy
[1:03:07] Spirit at University but I still had you
[1:03:10] know demons can hibernate and hide you
[1:03:13] don't overcome they they realize you
[1:03:16] want to raise your head they hide and
[1:03:18] they they gather the power and wait for
[1:03:21] another opportune moment the Lord
[1:03:24] exposes them so what happened I
[1:03:26] eventually the Lord knew that that demon
[1:03:29] you didn't overcome
[1:03:30] it so the Lord made things in my
[1:03:34] preparation for the marriage that my
[1:03:36] wife could not travel then we had to had
[1:03:39] to have a wedding Minister advised and
[1:03:43] and and officiated by the white
[1:03:47] Pastor
[1:03:49] so at any point in my life I can without
[1:03:53] any Shadow without any fear of contra
[1:03:55] addtion yeah that the Lord placed me at
[1:03:59] any specific time in any specific place
[1:04:04] and he placed the right people for that
[1:04:06] and that's what I want to thank God for
[1:04:08] and he did the same he the Lord repeats
[1:04:11] the Lord does not change he repeats if
[1:04:13] you fail a question paper for the Lord
[1:04:16] he doesn't change it he brings the same
[1:04:18] one you see the Lord is not like a very
[1:04:21] unfair examiner who tricks you no he
[1:04:23] brings the same question paper until
[1:04:25] till you pass it and he'll make a
[1:04:27] provision for you to pass it that's what
[1:04:30] he did for me the Lord repeated himself
[1:04:32] throughout my life looking back and then
[1:04:36] shakina was was was
[1:04:40] cream Shaka was scam one of the
[1:04:42] outstanding sermons that I always tell
[1:04:45] sit down with brother Ben just to chew
[1:04:46] it
[1:04:48] again was breaking the the generational
[1:04:51] cases it was a series and I landed here
[1:04:54] with my family in the middle of that
[1:04:57] series
[1:04:59] man man I never had you know God has got
[1:05:02] gifts and I I can't praise a man but God
[1:05:05] has got gifts that comes and and reveal
[1:05:08] certain things in your life and exposes
[1:05:11] you to the sunshine yeah so that's what
[1:05:13] I thank God for today and I just want to
[1:05:16] give him all glory and all honor and I
[1:05:18] cannot if I go on brother brother Ben
[1:05:21] said there's no preaching just give you
[1:05:24] a testimony so but may God really bless
[1:05:26] you let's take this battle forward and
[1:05:29] not not we are almost there we are
[1:05:32] almost there I love each and every one
[1:05:34] of you continue I'm in a season now in
[1:05:38] my life Armand
[1:05:39] where I'm raising children at an age
[1:05:43] where I never raised children to be 18
[1:05:46] 22 I never did that kind of a thing it's
[1:05:48] a new experience for me and God said no
[1:05:52] no you don't have to have experience to
[1:05:53] raise them I am with you amen so I
[1:05:56] really thank God and I appreciate my
[1:05:58] children because sometimes I'm
[1:06:00] hard and the Lord said am I hard to
[1:06:05] you the Lord asked me am I hard to you
[1:06:09] that's right I said Lord change me again
[1:06:12] so I want to give God all the glory and
[1:06:15] I'm so proud and privileged to call each
[1:06:17] and every girl in this church my
[1:06:20] daughter BL
[1:06:27] it's coming he knew I was going to call
[1:06:29] him next day and I look at the other
[1:06:32] Deacon too if you get the deacons on
[1:06:34] your side you sort them I told brother
[1:06:35] gben he needs to come with me and we
[1:06:37] stand here
[1:06:38] together so a lot of things happen for
[1:06:42] me in my life here in chak Tabernacle no
[1:06:46] it's not the end like we said so it's
[1:06:49] now exciting we're moving we're making
[1:06:51] space for those last souls to come in so
[1:06:54] we're excited and we still we still
[1:06:57] hungering and thirsting for
[1:06:58] righteousness for everyone I was lost
[1:07:02] and I was found and I'm here so there
[1:07:05] must be someone out there I was the
[1:07:07] worst of the worst and if it can do it
[1:07:09] for me it can do it for him or her and
[1:07:12] that's why we and that's why we're
[1:07:13] moving that's why we're moving we need
[1:07:15] to press on um a couple of things the
[1:07:19] best song leader ever I cannot change my
[1:07:22] testimony I've said this many a times so
[1:07:26] when my testimony changes something is
[1:07:28] is not right my testimony cannot change
[1:07:31] so best song leader is sitting there at
[1:07:33] the back brother kin he stepped into a
[1:07:36] gap he sang with with all he had all the
[1:07:41] keys he had and and it was
[1:07:43] wonderful that made that M that started
[1:07:46] to change in me that started to go Lord
[1:07:50] so now I'm speaking to the Lord and I'm
[1:07:52] seeing this this warehouse and buckets
[1:07:54] standing everywhere and water dripping
[1:07:57] and moldy and the brother Ben was
[1:07:59] crooked and all that you know that's my

[1:11:54] [Applause]
[1:12:01] I think pin will take too long hey
[1:12:04] like um God bless you I just want to
[1:12:09] make a continuation from what brother Ed
[1:12:11] said it's interesting how
[1:12:14] God plans everything in ahead for you
[1:12:17] because we just came in after everything
[1:12:19] has been laid out there's a sing this
[1:12:23] everything is done here there's a pastor
[1:12:24] there's you know this just but for
[1:12:28] me I've been a Believer I've been raised
[1:12:31] in the message all my
[1:12:34] life but I want to say coming here it
[1:12:39] made me step a notch higher
[1:12:43] spiritually and I thank God that you
[1:12:46] said what you said everything was laid
[1:12:48] out but that was what we see in the in
[1:12:52] the physical but there's also what I
[1:12:55] came and I saw in the spiritual and for
[1:12:58] me that's what really touches me about
[1:13:00] this church it's not the
[1:13:03] building cuz we living here so it's Shak
[1:13:07] is not this this building Shak is
[1:13:09] you and what I received spiritually and
[1:13:14] how I've grown spiritually from just
[1:13:16] fellowshipping with all of
[1:13:18] you I cannot I cannot put words glory is
[1:13:23] to the Lord
[1:13:26] and on top of that this is my hair I
[1:13:31] have to say I have to say that this is
[1:13:34] my hair I look at the mirror every day I
[1:13:37] know I have given a testimony God
[1:13:39] delivered me from something we call
[1:13:41] trania and I've been wondering should I
[1:13:44] come and say should I but I just said
[1:13:46] yeah if if I don't say rock will speak
[1:13:48] for me I'm not going to allow that
[1:13:50] because this is a battle I've fought
[1:13:52] since I was around 9 years old
[1:13:55] and for as long as I
[1:13:58] remember this section of my head up to
[1:14:01] around here uh this section and at the
[1:14:04] back was as you can see
[1:14:07] here it's not because it's pulling
[1:14:09] itself out or it's not growing it's
[1:14:11] because I'm pulling it my hair out man
[1:14:14] is a disorder where you pull your your
[1:14:17] hair out I started having that uh
[1:14:21] disorder when I was around 9 or 10 years
[1:14:23] old and and I something bad had happened
[1:14:27] to me and um it's when we came to New
[1:14:30] Zealand that God really kind of just
[1:14:34] give me a flashback spiritually of what
[1:14:36] really happened and how those demons
[1:14:38] just came in and took anchor and all my
[1:14:42] life until then I kept asking
[1:14:46] God how do I pray God heal this person
[1:14:50] you heal them how do I pray God help me
[1:14:53] with this and you give me you've you've
[1:14:54] given I can
[1:14:56] count and run out of what you I have
[1:14:58] prayed and you have answered but you
[1:15:01] just don't answer this which is right on
[1:15:03] my head and all my life nobody has ever
[1:15:07] really seen as apart from my husband and
[1:15:10] maybe my family that really seen me with
[1:15:12] my with my natural hair cuz I've always
[1:15:15] done wigs and weaves and just to cover
[1:15:17] my hair and I've always when I wear them
[1:15:19] I got to a point where the devil was
[1:15:21] telling telling me that um uh you'll
[1:15:24] just you just live like that for the
[1:15:26] rest of your life maybe God will deliver
[1:15:27] you when you go to heaven but I'm
[1:15:30] like so what's the point of Deliverance
[1:15:32] if if you cannot deliver this and then
[1:15:36] more I hear that then I I put on the
[1:15:38] message and the prophet says you're here
[1:15:40] you're here and I'm like go those are
[1:15:42] two two different Spirits talking and
[1:15:45] I'm not going to listen to this other
[1:15:46] one I want my Deliverance so this is a
[1:15:50] testimony that I can put my hair my com
[1:15:53] and com a hair at the front
[1:15:55] and I have all this this is a testimony
[1:15:59] that
[1:16:00] I've I've dreamed all my life as long as
[1:16:03] I knew I had hair on my head so I'm just
[1:16:07] grateful that when we came here we found
[1:16:10] a spiritual
[1:16:12] Landing not saying that there are no
[1:16:15] battles
[1:16:17] but it's through the fights and it's
[1:16:20] through the victories that I've learned
[1:16:23] and I've grown spiritually in a way that
[1:16:25] I cannot say I did uh when we were back
[1:16:28] home so I'm just grateful for all of
[1:16:32] you sometimes I might look like I'm just
[1:16:34] in my own world and I disappear and they
[1:16:36] come back but I'm forever grateful for
[1:16:41] Shak and like my husband said when we
[1:16:45] came we just we just
[1:16:48] felt at peace I think that's the word we
[1:16:51] just felt at peace when he walked in and
[1:16:53] we saw brother kuin and he just smiled
[1:16:56] and you know the way he does and he was
[1:16:58] just so at peace when we left and we
[1:17:00] were driving back to the hotel we were
[1:17:03] like that's the church that's the church
[1:17:06] J was like I'm not going to any other
[1:17:11] church that's the church but it's not
[1:17:14] the church it's not the building it's
[1:17:15] the people so we are grateful for that
[1:17:18] and I just want to add that when one
[1:17:20] door is closing it means there's another
[1:17:22] door opening and I believe and I pray
[1:17:25] that we have our own not not rental God
[1:17:28] bless
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] you the war
[1:17:35] truck I wasn't going to wait for you to
[1:17:37] call
[1:17:39] me okay I was sitting there and I was
[1:17:42] thinking should I should I should I
[1:17:43] should I and yeah um so we all stand
[1:17:48] here today giving a testimony but
[1:17:50] there's no testimony without a
[1:17:53] test and
[1:17:56] um I I came into the message um a major
[1:18:02] test it was not something that
[1:18:05] um that anyone would want but
[1:18:09] um I believe that the the foot footsteps
[1:18:13] of the righteous is ordered of the Lord
[1:18:15] and even though it was through major
[1:18:18] heartache that I sought the
[1:18:20] Lord I believe that that was meant for
[1:18:25] me to appreciate what he was going to do
[1:18:27] in my life later on and going through
[1:18:31] that is it's not a nice thing
[1:18:35] um
[1:18:36] but okay I can't stand you all day
[1:18:38] giving a whole testimony because it's
[1:18:40] way it's it's too much but um you
[1:18:45] know I always ask the Lord why you know
[1:18:49] losing a baby is the hardest thing a
[1:18:51] mother can ever do but when Ben and Mark
[1:18:55] had um little
[1:18:58] Gabriel I went on my knees so many days
[1:19:02] praying for them and praying for that
[1:19:03] little baby because I could enter in
[1:19:07] knowing what it was like going through
[1:19:10] the trauma of having the baby and Market
[1:19:12] being in hospital and the baby born and
[1:19:16] the first pictures and things like that
[1:19:19] I said to the Lord so many times I said
[1:19:21] to the Lord we've lost a baby
[1:19:25] please please let them have that it's
[1:19:30] just the hardest thing and it would be
[1:19:33] something that will be their anchor and
[1:19:35] I'm thankful that the lord gave them
[1:19:38] little Gabriel because he's such a
[1:19:39] blessing he's I call I call him a little
[1:19:42] Smiley baby because every time you look
[1:19:45] at him and every time you call his name
[1:19:47] he smiles so for that Journey I'm
[1:19:51] thankful I'm I have a such a thank heart
[1:19:55] to the Lord for our little
[1:19:57] Gabriel but that's just one little
[1:20:00] testimony you know I've also learned
[1:20:04] through the years you know we've we've
[1:20:05] been serving the lord for 22 years
[1:20:08] now Never Say Never
[1:20:14] okay you knew that was coming
[1:20:18] um you know we we were in New Zealand
[1:20:21] just just a couple of years and we came
[1:20:24] we came down to Wellington and um we
[1:20:27] stayed at sister Kay's little um Cottage
[1:20:32] and you know Matt said to me oh we
[1:20:35] should move down to Wellington and I
[1:20:38] said to him I will never move to
[1:20:42] Alon oh
[1:20:44] de and um here we are and um you know
[1:20:48] when when the Lord put it on on Matt's
[1:20:50] heart for us to move down here you know
[1:20:52] up until that point you know um every

[1:21:33] Heart of Gold and for his people he is
[1:21:36] so selfless and I'm not lifting the the
[1:21:40] man up I'm just lifting the the Lord in
[1:21:43] the man you know and what he's done for
[1:21:47] us here looking at everyone listening to
[1:21:50] everyone's testimony you know he's done
[1:21:53] and touched every sing single life
[1:21:55] that's sitting here and had an impact um
[1:21:59] on everyone's life um for me personally
[1:22:04] I have grown so much under his ministry
[1:22:10] I've
[1:22:12] found peace and rest and I'm happy the
[1:22:16] journey hasn't been easy the walk hasn't
[1:22:20] been without his trials but sister ping
[1:22:25] you hit it right on the we have to talk
[1:22:29] about it as a family as a church family
[1:22:32] we pray for each other constantly we
[1:22:35] support each other through everything we
[1:22:37] talk about it and that's how we can go
[1:22:40] on from day to day and week to week um I
[1:22:44] feel exactly the same sometimes I feel
[1:22:47] like adant or Isaac or brother Ben also
[1:22:50] standing outside our window listening to
[1:22:52] our conversations you know last week um
[1:22:56] brother Isaac brought his message across
[1:22:58] and you know afterwards Tiana said to me
[1:23:01] you know that's we were driving to
[1:23:02] taranaki and we were talking about stuff
[1:23:05] and that's ex everything that he said
[1:23:08] was exactly what we were talking about
[1:23:10] how does he know those kind of things
[1:23:12] but the Lord does amen and when when
[1:23:16] those confirmations come through it's
[1:23:18] actually just to secure and anchor your
[1:23:22] walk and your faith and that's what I
[1:23:25] believe um I'm excited for the new

[1:23:33] me they know that I really struggle with
[1:23:36] change um I'm very grounded and very

[1:23:45] like okay you know cuz I just don't do
[1:23:49] well with change but um I have peace
[1:23:53] about this I know that the Lord taking

[1:25:26] get a race up here um I just want to say
[1:25:29] God bless you all um it's been an
[1:25:31] amazing journey um a quick testimony
[1:25:34] from myself is obviously we have shifted
[1:25:37] down to Wellington um the the journey or
[1:25:41] or the the kicker was um to well i' say
[1:25:46] we've got this Camp not the camp before
[1:25:47] the camp before that um but before that
[1:25:51] camp we well person Al I has um got into
[1:25:56] a bit of a a uh everything was ticking
[1:26:01] over type scenario nothing was wrong
[1:26:03] nothing was really that right and I got
[1:26:06] lazy and I
[1:26:07] started um just just leaving things un
[1:26:12] unsettled un
[1:26:15] um I'm just sort of put it
[1:26:18] um there was okay looking back there was
[1:26:21] three things in my life that were
[1:26:23] affecting me but push them aside I
[1:26:25] didn't go fix it I didn't go out there
[1:26:28] and and actually organize these things
[1:26:31] in in a way that was best for the Lord
[1:26:33] and myself and my family and they they
[1:26:35] crept in and they started causing me
[1:26:38] to um I I guess get into the rut of
[1:26:41] daily living I was I was going to church
[1:26:45] I was going to work I was just just
[1:26:48] living but not on fire for God and um
[1:26:53] and and it just and continued in this
[1:26:55] way and that that camp um I'd say three
[1:26:59] 3 years ago um down here in wton was an
[1:27:04] amazing time an absolutely amazing time
[1:27:07] um
[1:27:08] the the the atmosphere the people and
[1:27:11] everything and and I and I switched and
[1:27:13] I was like oh man now now I'm I'm on
[1:27:16] fire like things are right with me now
[1:27:18] like we're we're good and it took a week
[1:27:21] of coming home that those three things
[1:27:23] got shut back in my face not fixed not
[1:27:26] fixed not fixed and I'm like no no no no
[1:27:30] we we're fixed like these things are
[1:27:31] fine like like like how and why what's
[1:27:34] what's what's changed and I sort of took
[1:27:37] took stock of that I'm like how is that
[1:27:40] not
[1:27:41] sorted um and I and I started praying
[1:27:45] and and looking in I'm like okay okay
[1:27:47] what's wrong I was like I know I'm good
[1:27:49] now like I'm I'm not in a in a bad space
[1:27:52] I'm good I'm good with the Lord with
[1:27:54] we're good so why are these things not
[1:27:57] fixed when I'm sure they were and
[1:28:00] started looking into that and thinking
[1:28:03] okay right maybe maybe I'm right I'm
[1:28:07] good with the Lord but I'm not where I'm
[1:28:09] supposed to be and from there it was uh
[1:28:13] okay well if if God blesses me then I
[1:28:16] will I will start putting out feelers
[1:28:18] and see if that is right if I'm I'm good
[1:28:21] with the Lord but I'm not where I'm
[1:28:23] supposed to to be so from there um I've
[1:28:26] always had a a heart for the church down
[1:28:28] here um always tried to help out and
[1:28:31] almost almost had a toe in the door at
[1:28:33] times I feel so that was the first sort
[1:28:36] of inclan okay try Wellington and we had
[1:28:39] tried in the past um many years ago I
[1:28:42] think you guys were downstairs or even
[1:28:43] at the first church to to move down this
[1:28:46] way and it didn't work out so okay fine
[1:28:48] fine um so I tried again and the initial
[1:28:52] response was and I tried work was was
[1:28:54] the initial thing so if I need to move I
[1:28:56] need to be able to support my family so
[1:28:59] I'll see if there's a job down here um
[1:29:01] initially the the people I tried sort of
[1:29:03] came back with no not not really going
[1:29:04] to work and then it was a week later
[1:29:06] they rang up and said yes please come
[1:29:08] and I was like okay cool that's the
[1:29:10] first inkling and we organized
[1:29:13] everything we moved and it hasn't been
[1:29:17] an easy easy Road it took us over a year
[1:29:19] to sell the house in Teran
[1:29:22] so mother-in-law okay is obviously here
[1:29:25] but she put up with us for a year living
[1:29:27] in her house which as anyone knows when
[1:29:28] you're living in someone else's space
[1:29:30] with your own family it's it's difficult
[1:29:32] um and I say things with with work and
[1:29:36] and the struggles there with the change
[1:29:37] of how I had to move things but looking
[1:29:40] back God has blessed the road it hasn't
[1:29:43] been oh we've come down here and
[1:29:45] everything's gone switched back straight
[1:29:46] we're good um my life is perfect no no
[1:29:49] no there's still struggles there's still
[1:29:51] character building there's still
[1:29:52] testimonies but I know I've done the
[1:29:55] right thing because of as Colin said the
[1:29:57] fruits and it took about half a year
[1:30:01] with yourself and and now you're coming
[1:30:04] my eldest two kids have been baptized
[1:30:06] and it's and it's just you see it
[1:30:08] through the fruits so I just say thank
[1:30:10] you Lord and um God bless you
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:19] all it's good to have you on the base
[1:30:21] let's make two more testimonies so so

[1:54:21] we're going to go to Joshua 4 please
[1:54:24] we'll just start
[1:54:28] that oh de let's try this
[1:54:40] again
[1:54:42] um maybe next time when I have a
[1:54:45] chance maybe go back just a couple of
[1:54:48] can I go back is just driving let just
[1:54:50] see go back a couple of slides just
[1:54:52] before Joshua
[1:54:54] 4 this is what it's all
[1:54:57] about this is what what we lab before is
[1:55:02] to birth Souls into the kingdom of God
[1:55:05] to give them a chance to meet the great
[1:55:07] God that we have met this is what we
[1:55:09] what we here for there many a more but
[1:55:12] these are the golden moments I went
[1:55:14] through all my memories of this church
[1:55:16] every brother that meant something to me
[1:55:18] I've got I've got so many I could say
[1:55:20] but I I we've we've got gone over the
[1:55:23] time but this is G in flesh because
[1:55:28] every one of you young persons have to
[1:55:30] have a chance to meet him every one of
[1:55:34] you older persons brother Colin must
[1:55:37] have a chance to meet him that's why we
[1:55:40] here that's why brother Ben stands
[1:55:42] behind this Pulpit day in day out Sunday
[1:55:45] preaching giving his heart burdens
[1:55:48] because he wants to see people birthed
[1:55:50] into the kingdom of God
[1:55:53] amen so let us just go here Joshua 4 and
[1:55:56] we're going to read here the 12 memorial
[1:55:58] stones we'll start the at verse number
[1:56:01] eight and the children of Israel did so
[1:56:05] as Joshua commanded and took up the 12
[1:56:08] Stones Out of the midst of the Jordan as
[1:56:10] the Lord spake unto Joshua according to
[1:56:12] the number of the tribes of the children
[1:56:14] of Israel and They carried them over
[1:56:16] unto the uh um is unto the place where
[1:56:20] they lodged and they laid them down
[1:56:22] and Joshua set up the 12 Stones in the
[1:56:25] mid of the Jordan in the place with the
[1:56:27] feet of the priest which bear the Ark of
[1:56:30] the Covenant stood and they are they
[1:56:32] unto this day amen may the Lord just
[1:56:36] bless his word you may be
[1:56:39] seated
[1:56:41] so you're a written
[1:56:43] epistle read and known of all
[1:56:47] men and they they look at
[1:56:50] you but before you can have a testimony
[1:56:53] like they said all of you preached my
[1:56:55] sermon so I don't I'm just going to go
[1:56:56] over it a little softly but I want to
[1:56:58] Anchor in something today I'm not a I
[1:57:00] don't have a Teaching Ministry as such
[1:57:02] I'm not a very good teacher I'm more
[1:57:04] like you know just a soldier just March
[1:57:07] and do it but there's something that the
[1:57:09] Lord placed on my heart and I thought
[1:57:12] sometimes we just have to take one step
[1:57:13] back to
[1:57:14] basics because we we want this
[1:57:17] highflying moments and we want Miracles
[1:57:19] and days of Miracles and seeing s uh
[1:57:22] people birthed into the kingdom of God
[1:57:24] but we we forget the basics of the whole
[1:57:26] thing there's a certain way God wants
[1:57:28] you to come and and it's he knows you're
[1:57:31] coming he selected you predestinated
[1:57:34] before the foundation of the world and
[1:57:36] so he's already chosen you you're you
[1:57:38] want you're there but he wants you still
[1:57:43] to come a certain
[1:57:44] way so what's the point of sending us a
[1:57:47] prophet in this end age if we can just
[1:57:49] do and make and say and please what we
[1:57:51] want to where's the what's the point of
[1:57:53] brother brandom coming and preaching
[1:57:55] this message living a life having to go
[1:57:57] through all of that and we just glaze
[1:57:59] over these things so you children this
[1:58:01] is for you I've put as many pictures as
[1:58:03] I can in here possibly and I want to I
[1:58:06] want to drop something in
[1:58:08] here and which we see the memorial
[1:58:11] stones if we go one
[1:58:13] back brother it is that driving oh back
[1:58:16] here okay sorry we had a technical
[1:58:18] glitch don't worry it's not our first
[1:58:20] rodeo there we go so we look at these
[1:58:23] memorial stones and basically what
[1:58:25] happens is Joshua came to the River
[1:58:28] Jordan and God gave him which we read in
[1:58:31] the in Joshua 1 he said you go over the
[1:58:33] river you take the land it's your
[1:58:35] promised land so God's telling him to
[1:58:38] come over the river God's giving the
[1:58:40] instruction to go over the river but
[1:58:42] what happens is Joshua has to still do
[1:58:47] it don't get me wrong we always see
[1:58:49] Moses cross the river with the Red Sea
[1:58:51] we always see Joshua going through and
[1:58:53] there's wonderful Miracles but remember
[1:58:55] he's standing in front of this big body
[1:58:57] of water and it's
[1:59:00] daunting and I says I don't know how
[1:59:03] it's going to happen but God wants me to
[1:59:05] go through here and so when he takes
[1:59:08] these 12 Stones he takes it and he
[1:59:10] builds a memorial and he says I want to
[1:59:12] remind you that God did this in this
[1:59:17] place right here and he laid those
[1:59:20] stones at the foundation there where the
[1:59:22] Ark of the Covenant was standing right
[1:59:24] there in the river and he laid them
[1:59:26] there at their
[1:59:27] feet because he wanted to know there's a
[1:59:30] place which going to tie you back where
[1:59:31] your journey
[1:59:33] started so it brings us to
[1:59:37] justification so children justification
[1:59:40] is very
[1:59:42] simple Abraham had a promise God said I
[1:59:46] will deliver my people with a mighty
[1:59:49] hand they're going to sojourn in a land
[1:59:52] but I'm going to come I God is going to
[1:59:54] deliver my
[1:59:55] people he didn't say Moses was going to
[1:59:58] do it he said I'm going to do it how
[2:00:01] he's going to do it Joshua didn't know
[2:00:04] Moses didn't know yet but he said I am
[2:00:06] going to do it for 400 years and also
[2:00:09] that Nation who served them will I judge
[2:00:12] because our God when he fights for you
[2:00:14] he fights for everything all your
[2:00:17] battles all your hurts all your troubles
[2:00:20] all your doubts all your frustration all
[2:00:22] the things that's daunting to you God
[2:00:23] will fight it for you we need to show up
[2:00:26] but to know that there was a promise for
[2:00:29] the
[2:00:29] Israelites so the Israelites find
[2:00:32] themselves here in Pharaoh's U Palace
[2:00:35] and they just mud doublers they just
[2:00:37] busy busy with their everyday life and
[2:00:41] uh they got used to being there and
[2:00:43] there was three stages of their Journey
[2:00:46] you know so if you think about
[2:00:47] justification there's three stages of
[2:00:49] your journey with God okay for we
[2:00:52] justified by faith believing on the Lord
[2:00:55] Jesus Christ forsaking the land of
[2:00:58] Egypt so we know we have to come out of
[2:01:00] this land of Egypt because the promise
[2:01:03] said you're not part of this world your
[2:01:06] the promise of God says you're you're
[2:01:08] part of a world to come you know we
[2:01:11] don't seek a kingdom here on Earth we
[2:01:13] seek a kingdom up there in heaven amen
[2:01:15] you know and that Kingdom will come down
[2:01:17] and will reign in the Millennium there's
[2:01:19] a promise for you but we found ourselves
[2:01:22] in this place in
[2:01:24] Egypt we find ourselves on the cyber
[2:01:27] world we find ourselves in YouTube
[2:01:30] channels and all these type of things we
[2:01:32] find ourselves in Hollywood Fame and
[2:01:34] Fortune we find ourselves come to a
[2:01:37] place when we were birthed that is
[2:01:39] riddled with
[2:01:41] sin Superstars and super cars and all
[2:01:44] these wonderful things out there don't

[2:02:40] your legs do it we won't we won't think
[2:02:42] anything bad of you but just follow me
[2:02:44] through this one this is very important
[2:02:47] so you are in this
[2:02:50] place you were Bor born in sin shaped in
[2:02:53] iniquity coming to this lies um world
[2:02:55] speaking lies this is the state that you
[2:02:58] are in you can't change it no matter how
[2:03:02] much you want to change that state you
[2:03:04] cannot change it that's your natural
[2:03:07] birth it sucks you're in
[2:03:12] Egypt but the only place that you know
[2:03:15] how to come out of Egypt is there has to
[2:03:17] be a call upon your heart and there must
[2:03:20] be a Divine reflection to say hey there
[2:03:23] must be more than
[2:03:27] this and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:30] and the preacher is preaching and Camp
[2:03:32] is going on because we're preparing for
[2:03:34] camp and he's and he's delivering the
[2:03:36] word and he's telling you a lesson
[2:03:38] there's more for
[2:03:40] you listen the world is shiny but I've
[2:03:43] got more for you I've got a place where
[2:03:46] you can have happiness all the time I
[2:03:50] have a place where you can have peace
[2:03:52] all the time look a trial is a trial you
[2:03:54] can be in the biggest battle you ever
[2:03:56] fought and you can still be
[2:03:58] happy I'm a witness to it who who who's
[2:04:02] seen it you look at your bank account in
[2:04:04] the end of the month you go oh Lord
[2:04:06] Brother Ben how are you're going to do
[2:04:08] it but you get more excited because you
[2:04:10] know he's going to do it you just don't
[2:04:11] know how because you're standing at that
[2:04:13] River and that River looks really
[2:04:16] daunting and you go God I don't know how
[2:04:18] we going to cross this thing I don't
[2:04:20] know how I'm going to overcome this sin
[2:04:22] I'm not know how am I going to drown
[2:04:24] depression how am I going to do this I
[2:04:26] don't know I'm here at the river and he
[2:04:28] says all I want you to do is cross over
[2:04:31] but put me
[2:04:33] first so he goes to
[2:04:36] them and he goes and he meets Moses and
[2:04:39] he says to Moses I want you to deliver
[2:04:41] my
[2:04:42] people and he goes to brother Ben and he
[2:04:44] says brother Ben I've got a message for
[2:04:46] Sunday I want you to deliver my people
[2:04:49] but see the people wasn't ready to
[2:04:50] receive from Moses
[2:04:53] yet because they were looking for God
[2:04:56] but they didn't see God in the man so
[2:04:59] respecting the offers that's behind the
[2:05:01] pulpit respecting the gifts in the body
[2:05:03] is very crucial because that's God
[2:05:05] sending a man to deliver you now he told
[2:05:08] them all he saw a burning bush he went
[2:05:10] to the Egyptians man this would be the
[2:05:12] coolest thing you've ever seen a brother
[2:05:14] I come there to you and I walk in I go
[2:05:16] hey brother I saw a bush that was
[2:05:19] burning and it wasn't consumed
[2:05:23] it was on fire it was I could feel the
[2:05:25] heat I've had it all it was so big that
[2:05:28] I had it got me noticed cuz I was just
[2:05:30] doing the Sheep you know for my dad and
[2:05:32] father-in-law and and it got my
[2:05:34] attention and when I got there it says
[2:05:35] take off your shoes and he's bringing
[2:05:38] this message to Egypt but Egypt's not
[2:05:40] ready for him here you are in church
[2:05:43] young people old people the message is
[2:05:45] here you can be taken all your sins as
[2:05:50] paid for already
[2:05:52] but the messenger comes and he says do
[2:05:54] you want to give it up so can you repeat
[2:05:57] the can you believe the report of The
[2:05:59] Messer or is it too
[2:06:01] unbelievable we had testimony after
[2:06:04] testimony in this place in these four
[2:06:06] walls we God delivered people from sin
[2:06:09] and from darkness and from drugs and
[2:06:12] from alcohol and partying and all those
[2:06:14] things and he sends a messenger not just
[2:06:17] the message of the hour but even your
[2:06:19] pastor and saying you could have that if
[2:06:22] you want to let it go amen but see to be
[2:06:25] purely Justified you have to accept the
[2:06:28] word of the Prophet or else you're still
[2:06:31] just a mut
[2:06:33] dobler you're living under your
[2:06:36] privilege you ain't free from that sin
[2:06:39] no matter how many people said we buried
[2:06:41] that thing H sister we buried that thing
[2:06:44] and all of a sudden the H it shows its
[2:06:46] head again why cuz you still haven't
[2:06:48] accepted your way you're still living
[2:06:49] under your privilege you're still a
[2:06:51] Slave
[2:06:53] and yes we need to fight but hold on
[2:06:55] justification says you never done it in
[2:06:57] the first place the blood of Jesus
[2:07:00] Christ Struck it off you've never done
[2:07:02] it God looks at you it's never been done
[2:07:03] amen so as much as the devil wants to
[2:07:05] come you you still have sin you go nah I
[2:07:09] don't have sin God took it away but you
[2:07:12] need to come the right way there's a
[2:07:15] provided way for God so children don't
[2:07:17] miss this now here we go

[2:07:55] totally separated from God and if their
[2:07:58] life should end right there on that day
[2:08:02] they will come before the great Throne
[2:08:03] of judgment and they will be judged
[2:08:05] according to the way they

[2:09:06] Spirit you know the thing is you cannot
[2:09:08] justify my sin if somebody else's sin is
[2:09:11] greater then that justifies me sinning
[2:09:13] don't look at justification like that
[2:09:16] we're all individuals in front of God so
[2:09:18] the world is having fun they're online
[2:09:20] gaming they've got Facebook Twitter all
[2:09:22] those other stuff they're so busy and
[2:09:24] they so much in contact with the
[2:09:28] world they forget about Christ and

[2:09:35] sleep they spend hours till
[2:09:38] 12:00 2:00 in the morning partying and
[2:09:42] having fun and fellowshipping in the
[2:09:44] name of Jesus Christ and the next day
[2:09:45] brother Ben is trying to share a message

[2:09:53] why if life is here and it's freely
[2:09:57] available for you to help you in the
[2:09:59] times when you need it why are you

[2:10:08] all have you ever thought about it if
[2:10:11] you're so under the anointing of God if
[2:10:13] you're so prepared to come here to
[2:10:14] church and say today I'm having my
[2:10:17] blessing and last night when you went on
[2:10:19] your knees before you slept say Lord

[2:10:28] has to just come say here Lord Jesus
[2:10:30] take over and he will take over he
[2:10:32] doesn't have to study no scriptures he
[2:10:34] doesn't have to come and try to get a
[2:10:36] thought the thought will be already
[2:10:38] there because you have a hunger you have
[2:10:41] a need but but unfortunately because we
[2:10:43] have a need we're filling it with these
[2:10:46] things but you actually need
[2:10:49] him you actually just need him you can
[2:10:52] still do all these things don't get me
[2:10:54] wrong no drinking hold on that was cool
[2:10:58] drink by the way I'm sure um you can
[2:11:00] still have fun we have the most we had
[2:11:02] Marion's birthday yesterday most awesome
[2:11:05] time I had at my house we were playing
[2:11:07] touch rugby and Ben was getting all
[2:11:09] excited and he I beat him that's all I
[2:11:12] wanted to say there was only one try
[2:11:14] sorry intercept right down the corner we
[2:11:16] had fun we were jumping trampoline we
[2:11:19] were just visiting we had the Bri master
[2:11:21] here we had the best food we had
[2:11:23] Fellowship we were all sitting there
[2:11:25] just having an awesome time clean
[2:11:28] beautiful awesome
[2:11:31] time so you can have it but don't have
[2:11:35] it all the time and then when you come
[2:11:37] here you don't give God the first fruits
[2:11:39] that's right so this is just for us it's
[2:11:42] just to encourage you when you come here
[2:11:44] be a zealous as when you're there at a
[2:11:47] party be as zealous here and you will
[2:11:49] not leave you hungry you will not leave
[2:11:51] your malnutritious you will not leave
[2:11:54] you boring and bored out of your mind
[2:11:56] you will actually enjoy it the only
[2:11:58] thing is you're not in the right place
[2:12:01] but you want God to be in the right
[2:12:02] place it don't work like that God always
[2:12:05] comes where he's invited but you must
[2:12:07] prepare for war
[2:12:10] amen he says Where in the past times you
[2:12:13] were according to the course of the
[2:12:14] world according to the prince of the
[2:12:16] power of the air that worketh in the
[2:12:17] children of disobedient this is how we
[2:12:19] came but then said one day in this
[2:12:22] church there we had M he gave me brother
[2:12:26] Ben as a brother Ed as a deacon and
[2:12:29] brother Ben as a as a friend the pastor
[2:12:31] now see God sense a humor you know the
[2:12:34] the worst sinner you could think of
[2:12:36] possibly God goes don't worry armont I
[2:12:38] know you lie and you take chances I'm
[2:12:40] going to give you a really good friend
[2:12:41] he'll be a deacon and then your other
[2:12:43] good friend he'll be the pastor and
[2:12:45] they're going to shape you and those two
[2:12:48] men in my life that times played such a
[2:12:50] significant role
[2:12:51] because they were the balance to my
[2:12:53] unbalanced life so you have that
[2:12:56] brotherr in church that just rubs you
[2:12:58] the wrong way God put him there say
[2:13:01] thank you because that brother is not
[2:13:04] rubbing you hey James because he doesn't
[2:13:06] like you the brother's rubbing you
[2:13:09] because you're a pearl of Great Value
[2:13:13] but you need to be rubbed a bit and
[2:13:15] don't worry as much as I rub James James
[2:13:18] rubs back on me and the more I think man
[2:13:21] James annoys me I think he's preparing
[2:13:23] me for Ruben and Liam cuz they're coming
[2:13:25] cuz they're going to be his age so now I
[2:13:27] know when James comes and he looks like
[2:13:29] he wants to wrestle me I'll start
[2:13:30] running cuz I cannot take him anymore
[2:13:32] he's too strong he's just not faster
[2:13:35] than me yet cuz I get Ruben Liam to
[2:13:37] tackle him on the way out so we know
[2:13:39] we're done so so the question is you as
[2:13:42] a child if you haven't accepted the Lord
[2:13:44] Jesus Christ as your savior you are
[2:13:46] still living in sin because the sin
[2:13:49] question hasn't been settled
[2:13:51] you you haven't surrendered your life to
[2:13:53] Christ yet so you're still part of the
[2:13:55] world that's fine hold on you have a
[2:13:59] chance there's always a chance but when
[2:14:02] you say I accept the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:05] you must accept it with all of
[2:14:08] you you can't just accept him on your
[2:14:11] terms and conditions you know uh uh I'll
[2:14:15] I'll cut maybe deep with this one you
[2:14:16] can't say and I don't mean it that way
[2:14:19] remember my heart is cuz I love all you
[2:14:21] I share my life I accepted the Lord
[2:14:24] Jesus Christ but I still wanted to play
[2:14:27] cricket I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:30] and cricket's not wrong I've bring the
[2:14:33] balance but I wanted to drink
[2:14:35] still I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ I
[2:14:38] was sitting in brother Andy's house and
[2:14:39] I said man I love
[2:14:42] smoking because I wasn't clean yet the
[2:14:45] desire of those things was still in me
[2:14:48] so mentally I just accepted them but I
[2:14:51] I've not given a full
[2:14:53] surrender but it came so don't worry if
[2:14:56] you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:58] and you don't really kind understand why
[2:15:00] things don't work out all of a sudden
[2:15:01] and you're having battles and you can't
[2:15:03] get this depression and all those things
[2:15:05] gone you you can't get it gone hold on
[2:15:09] let's move on Amen cuz God don't just go
[2:15:12] Bing you're a Believer you're going to
[2:15:13] have Heaven Rapture let's go you're good
[2:15:15] fully mature awesome Elder in the church
[2:15:18] don't work that way God knows how to
[2:15:20] deal with you because he made you and he
[2:15:22] created
[2:15:23] you so we know as well that now you have
[2:15:26] to be washed and because you have to be
[2:15:28] cleaned you said Okay I accept the Lord
[2:15:30] Jesus as my savior and you sold out you
[2:15:32] say Lord who else do I go to just you
[2:15:35] and you say Lord your blood is enough
[2:15:38] but now you have to apply the blood you
[2:15:40] know because if you look at these
[2:15:42] Hebrews they were Moses said to them hey
[2:15:44] you just cover the lentil and the door
[2:15:46] POS with blood and your firstborn shall
[2:15:49] live now I want to be very serious if
[2:15:52] you didn't do it your firstborn was
[2:15:56] dead so if the word says to you to let
[2:15:59] something go the word I'm not going to
[2:16:01] say the g Lord Jesus Christ because he
[2:16:04] is his word but sometimes we listen to
[2:16:07] Jesus Christ so much and it's the wrong
[2:16:09] Jesus Christ you're listening to because
[2:16:11] you're listening to an enticing Spirit
[2:16:13] go find it in the word but no I don't
[2:16:16] have time to read the word because
[2:16:18] Twitter says this and this and this and
[2:16:20] this and you'll be deceived the voice is
[2:16:23] so close it will deceive you children
[2:16:26] wake up if you're not reading your word
[2:16:29] your Bible he will deceive you and no
[2:16:32] matter what any Angel preaches to you if
[2:16:35] it's contrary to this word do not take
[2:16:38] it brother brandham said I will believe
[2:16:40] any experience that a brother would tell
[2:16:43] me about seeing visions and talking to
[2:16:46] the Lord I'll believe all of it but if
[2:16:48] it doesn't matches the word I'll just
[2:16:50] leave it alone but I will believe it
[2:16:52] because I don't know how God talks to
[2:16:54] people that's not my job I know how he
[2:16:56] speaks to me and it's through his word
[2:16:58] and his preaches in the adoption series
[2:17:01] and the whole thing I'm doing is is
[2:17:03] we're just going to bring the basis
[2:17:04] because hopefully brother Ben lets me
[2:17:06] back one day and I if I don't say too
[2:17:08] many bad things Sister Christine but
[2:17:11] then we go on with the adoption because
[2:17:13] the adoption is placing you not just in
[2:17:16] Christ but positionally in Christ amen
[2:17:20] so actually saying that you're not just
[2:17:22] in Jesus Christ but there is a place for
[2:17:25] you a purpose a expected end that God
[2:17:28] wants to use you for a certain reason
[2:17:30] but I will place you there but you have
[2:17:32] to come a certain way and that's why
[2:17:34] brother Brandon preached the adoption
[2:17:36] series he wanted to tell little young
[2:17:38] ones is even if you're sitting in the
[2:17:40] Pew and you feel you're nothing in this
[2:17:42] church don't worry just come my way I
[2:17:45] will place you in the land cuz the book
[2:17:47] of Ephesians places the Believers right
[2:17:50] in the land
[2:17:51] and the Book of Joshua where Joshua
[2:17:53] takes the people and places them in the
[2:17:54] land it's the same old and the New
[2:17:56] Testament and here God comes to the
[2:17:58] prophet prophet and he says to us I'm
[2:18:00] going to place you in your land I'm
[2:18:02] going to say who you are the bride but I
[2:18:04] won't get ahead of myself we're not
[2:18:06] going to go there today so don't worry
[2:18:08] so I'm just letting you know the
[2:18:09] sanctification bit is if they did not
[2:18:12] apply the blood the firstborn
[2:18:15] died if you don't apply the blood you
[2:18:19] will die
[2:18:22] so no matter how much you spoke now to
[2:18:24] Moses and you spoke to Pharaoh one child
[2:18:28] lived and one child
[2:18:31] died it is what it is so if you do not
[2:18:34] apply the blood if you don't accept the
[2:18:36] Lord Jesus Christ you don't take his
[2:18:38] sacrifice that he died for your sin and
[2:18:39] you don't settle the sin question you
[2:18:41] haven't started as a Christian in the
[2:18:43] kingdom of God yet you're still an
[2:18:45] unbeliever you're still born in sin
[2:18:47] because the blood didn't strike off that
[2:18:49] sin but once you've sold out once that
[2:18:53] blood is applied to your heart and you
[2:18:55] said Lord by your grace see me through
[2:18:57] the blood then you're walking with the
[2:18:59] Lord but we're not there yet I want to
[2:19:02] ask how do you apply the blood do you
[2:19:05] know all you Bible
[2:19:08] readers he says now after the death of
[2:19:11] the Moses the servant the Lord spake
[2:19:13] unto the son of n Moses Minister saying
[2:19:16] Moses my servant is now dead therefore
[2:19:18] arise go over the Jordan
[2:19:20] so he's telling them that they should go
[2:19:22] over the Jordan he's telling them the
[2:19:25] promised land is through this Waterway
[2:19:27] right here why would God in Old T
[2:19:29] Testament do
[2:19:30] this why didn't he just take them around
[2:19:32] the
[2:19:34] Jordan why did he say I want you to
[2:19:36] cross through some
[2:19:38] water make
[2:19:42] sense he says my servant is dead go over
[2:19:45] the
[2:19:45] Jordan go over the
[2:19:49] Jordan if you want to receive the
[2:19:52] fullness of Christ there's your answer
[2:19:56] who knows it we preach about it so much
[2:19:58] acts
[2:19:59] 238 he says here then Peter said unto
[2:20:02] them repent be baptized everyone in the
[2:20:04] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[2:20:05] your sins and you shall get the gift of
[2:20:07] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is our
[2:20:08] Promised Land that's our token
[2:20:12] yeah so he says there's a way for you to
[2:20:14] enter into this light way he also says
[2:20:17] he straight As the gate and narrow as
[2:20:18] the way Jesus speaking says in few are
[2:20:20] they that will find that that straight
[2:20:22] is a Waterway so this is the if you
[2:20:25] could see in the back TV it looks better
[2:20:27] this is the big straight of jalra it's a
[2:20:30] massive
[2:20:32] thing but it is important because it
[2:20:34] links two continents together and a lot
[2:20:37] of trade goes through there and if they
[2:20:40] have a traffic jam it will be ter
[2:20:41] terrible but he wants you to go through
[2:20:44] the water and accept him and be washed
[2:20:47] by the blood so yes you can't and this
[2:20:50] is where we as as the message church we
[2:20:52] differ from people that says I gave my
[2:20:54] heart to the Lord and now I'm right I
[2:20:57] had a debate with someone very close to
[2:20:59] me and they said I don't need to be
[2:21:00] baptized they said that's wrong that's
[2:21:03] the devil speaking to you you need to be
[2:21:04] baptized because if you haven't been
[2:21:06] baptized you're not a Christian and he
[2:21:08] said you can't say that I gave my heart
[2:21:09] to the Lord I said yes that's true but
[2:21:12] acts 238 said you need to be baptized
[2:21:14] for the remission of your sin I said why
[2:21:16] did Jesus Christ get clean and
[2:21:18] Sanctified before he goes why why did
[2:21:20] John the Baptist have to to to um
[2:21:23] baptize Jesus Christ wash the sacrifice
[2:21:26] so if our Master does it why can't why
[2:21:28] don't you have to do it and I would like
[2:21:30] to see John the Baptist go there to
[2:21:32] Jesus and go go I sprinkle you and uh
[2:21:35] that's not washing you go to shower for
[2:21:38] that like a week I'm telling you your
[2:21:39] mom and dad ain't coming close to you if
[2:21:42] you're washing you want to get clean you
[2:21:45] want to fully submerged you want to get
[2:21:47] as far off the filth and dirt in your
[2:21:50] life as possible you want to get that
[2:21:52] out of you so a little bit of sprinkling
[2:21:55] ain't going to help it you have to go
[2:21:57] under the water you have to wash all
[2:21:59] that sin away and come up and it's a
[2:22:01] it's a it's a sign an outward sign to
[2:22:04] the rest of all the world here and
[2:22:07] Beyond the Veil which you can't see and
[2:22:09] in the other regions to say I am washed
[2:22:11] in the blood of the Lamb it's an open
[2:22:13] declaration that's why we doing it it's
[2:22:16] you saying I take the blood of Jesus
[2:22:18] Christ I come the way of the despise few
[2:22:21] few are they that would find it because
[2:22:23] they're debating about it so I'm always
[2:22:25] saying this thing for them I said if you
[2:22:26] want to have the power of Jesus Christ
[2:22:28] in your life but you don't want to get
[2:22:30] married to him that's the marriage
[2:22:33] ceremony if you don't want to get
[2:22:34] married take his
[2:22:36] name why are you using his name why
[2:22:39] can't you just cast demons out in the
[2:22:40] name of the father but the name of Jesus
[2:22:43] got power and people use it day in day
[2:22:46] out but they want to have the titles
[2:22:48] well I say give me Jesus
[2:22:51] cuz if I want to sign the checkbook I I
[2:22:53] want to make sure that Jesus's name is
[2:22:54] on that
[2:22:55] checkbook cuz no promise is going to
[2:22:58] come to pass yes God rewards Faith but
[2:23:00] the promises of God for his bride is in
[2:23:03] that this is where we start I'm going to
[2:23:06] make it short cuz I know we had a long
[2:23:07] one hang in there with
[2:23:09] me why did Moses go through the Red
[2:23:13] Sea so in Egypt brother brandom says
[2:23:17] here in Egypt they took the mo word of
[2:23:19] Moses and then they saned them through
[2:23:22] the blood washed them sins and then they
[2:23:23] became pilgrims and strangers and
[2:23:25] claiming where they seeking a city that
[2:23:27] was promised so even the Israelites had
[2:23:29] to cross this body of water to go to the
[2:23:32] promised land on their Journey now they
[2:23:34] went into the Wilderness and we know why
[2:23:37] because that was just where they didn't
[2:23:39] listen and they had to spend 40 years
[2:23:41] there they could make it so much
[2:23:43] faster he says oh I copied that one
[2:23:46] twice sorry okay so here Joshua he goes
[2:23:51] and he says let's go over the Jordan and
[2:23:52] they go over the Jordan and guess what
[2:23:54] they get there don't worry as if a baby
[2:23:57] never gr they get to the other side of
[2:23:59] the Jordan and now they're there they're
[2:24:02] in the promised
[2:24:03] land and he looks up and he sees those
[2:24:06] walls and he goes hey you say you're
[2:24:10] going to give me the promised land I
[2:24:12] accepted Jesus Christ I got baptized so
[2:24:14] everything's now fixed and brother col
[2:24:17] say what nope so we're still going to
[2:24:20] fight
[2:24:21] and guess what those cities that you
[2:24:22] testified of Joshua and Caleb that you
[2:24:24] said oh it's easy to take I'm going to
[2:24:26] test you now cuz that's what's waiting
[2:24:27] for you cuz they said we are more than
[2:24:30] able to take the land and God says sorry
[2:24:34] we are more than able to now I'm going
[2:24:35] to
[2:24:36] test I'm going to give you a test to
[2:24:39] have that testimony so be careful what
[2:24:41] you say oh I can overcome this cancer or
[2:24:43] I can overcome this depression I okay
[2:24:46] let's battle with him a bit on your own
[2:24:49] ability you can't do it but see nice
[2:24:52] thing that God said like all these
[2:24:53] things past hurts complexes
[2:24:55] unforgiveness angers lust depression
[2:24:57] anxiety sickness self that's the worst
[2:25:00] one those things are your land they they
[2:25:02] the jebusites and they all those
[2:25:04] Hittites and iri ties and everything
[2:25:07] that's in your way somebody have a ran
[2:25:09] out of some words there but they they
[2:25:12] it's the thing that irks you the most
[2:25:13] it's like why can't I get over this why
[2:25:16] do I my hair why is it such a thing Lord
[2:25:19] why can't you deliver me me and it's
[2:25:20] just sitting there waiting for you and
[2:25:24] God goes I got the battle no you worry I
[2:25:28] just I want you to show up and you're
[2:25:30] like Lord but when my time and then
[2:25:33] Joshua meets the captain of the host and
[2:25:35] the captain of the host goes remember
[2:25:38] God said to you be of a good courage he
[2:25:39] says but I'm here to take over the
[2:25:41] battle so I'm just paraphrasing because
[2:25:43] we I want to make up for time we're
[2:25:44] almost there so God's saying I'm going
[2:25:46] to step right into your battle because
[2:25:48] you came my provided way now I'm on on
[2:25:50] the scene because you didn't just accept
[2:25:52] my name you took my name and now you
[2:25:55] call upon my name now I step into the
[2:25:58] battle now I can start fighting for you
[2:26:00] CU you're now in the land hallelujah
[2:26:03] amen and guess
[2:26:06] what I thought if we had a long service
[2:26:08] will be to continue there there's much
[2:26:10] more hold on now I'll preach a bit
[2:26:13] there's actually way more but we we'll
[2:26:14] stop there for now cuz it is halfast
[2:26:18] 12 man you might want to hear this
[2:26:23] let's do this one I I'll land it here CU
[2:26:27] I must I must at least get some
[2:26:29] attention we're going to a new
[2:26:31] church we we we we we starting a new
[2:26:34] Journey we we we have turn the corner
[2:26:37] because we all accepted the Lord Jesus
[2:26:38] Christ is a mightier things for us okay
[2:26:40] but there's more land to possess there's
[2:26:43] more seeds to be fold there's more
[2:26:45] things to be done but young people this
[2:26:48] one is for you you have to still fight
[2:26:51] for every inch of the ground you stand
[2:26:54] on you're going to have to fight now
[2:26:58] I'll tell you as a old Warrior and a and
[2:27:01] a and a true man that can I like
[2:27:03] wrestling and fighting you can't pick a
[2:27:06] battle with someone that you know is
[2:27:08] going to beat you if you haven't trained
[2:27:09] before that
[2:27:11] fight CU they're going to beat
[2:27:15] you but you want to come in here in a
[2:27:18] Sunday and 5 minutes before Church get
[2:27:20] ready and do two push-ups and then think
[2:27:22] you're going to fight the massive
[2:27:26] giant isn't that the state of us you
[2:27:29] know we're like McDonald's eater and
[2:27:31] burger Fuel and all this La of rubbish
[2:27:33] food through the week and then we walk
[2:27:34] in here Wednesday in a 5 minutes God
[2:27:36] should just do
[2:27:39] everything when a when a preacher refers
[2:27:41] to scripture we don't even know where
[2:27:43] the book is he can give me he can go
[2:27:46] second opinions 5 and you'll still find
[2:27:47] it in your Bible you'll be paging the
[2:27:50] whole time you just hear this I I I'm
[2:27:53] this guy hey hey he goes okay let's go
[2:27:55] to the Book of John John John John John
[2:27:57] first John oh no now you made it
[2:27:59] difficult come on John first John John
[2:28:01] Matthew Luke John no not that first John
[2:28:03] first John your we first John and
[2:28:05] everybody's reading and Arman still
[2:28:08] going is it Old
[2:28:12] Testament how was that guy now I got
[2:28:15] clever I got a phone so I just go First
[2:28:17] John 3
[2:28:20] well I know where it is I can at least
[2:28:22] tell you if it's in the new of the Old
[2:28:23] Testament but I just want to say I was
[2:28:25] that guy but I never prepared for battle
[2:28:28] but then I expect God to come on the
[2:28:29] scene and fight my battle and he said to
[2:28:31] Joshua he didn't say hey the land is
[2:28:34] yours go sit there and your your play
[2:28:36] your guitar and have nice music there by
[2:28:39] yourself that's all you do playing
[2:28:41] guitar having a fun oh love you Jesus
[2:28:43] because see this is a bug bear of me but
[2:28:45] I'll say it now if you listen more to
[2:28:48] music then you listen to the message
[2:28:50] you're out of balance if you listen more
[2:28:52] to music then you read your Bible you're
[2:28:55] out of balance I don't care what gospel
[2:28:58] music it is children that it's lulling
[2:29:01] you to sleep because I've never seen
[2:29:04] people overcome in a and and and live a
[2:29:07] better life in one of y song Services
[2:29:10] they had an emotional experience there
[2:29:13] they didn't overcome cuz they didn't
[2:29:14] have the
[2:29:16] word they had emotion they had some word
[2:29:20] but they didn't have the word because
[2:29:22] they weren't in their Bible but every
[2:29:24] day you see people with iPods and ear
[2:29:26] pods and snob pops and my battery is
[2:29:28] dead so we just stop that one there and
[2:29:31] they in their own little world being
[2:29:33] lulled to
[2:29:35] sleep and you say Hey Brother Hey where
[2:29:37] did they write about again remember the
[2:29:38] baptism where is it
[2:29:40] written I don't know can't really put my
[2:29:43] finger on
[2:29:44] it huh where's the seals where was it
[2:29:47] Revelation or oh yeah I think the book
[2:29:49] of re solution
[2:29:51] yeah but that's what they do you I asked
[2:29:54] some K they where's the Ten Commandments
[2:29:56] written they couldn't tell me it had to
[2:29:59] be a debate because I find ourselves
[2:30:02] we're not in this word we're everywhere
[2:30:05] but in this word and this is the thing
[2:30:07] that's going to judge you one day and
[2:30:09] it's judging you now and you're getting
[2:30:11] caught out because the word comes over
[2:30:13] the pulpit and I don't see anybody
[2:30:15] checking what the preacher is saying not
[2:30:17] that you have to we had a chat about
[2:30:18] that yesterday but do you
[2:30:21] check or is the blind leading the blind
[2:30:24] then so so every guy on YouTube that has
[2:30:27] opinion about Jesus Christ and it's not
[2:30:29] in the word are you just going to follow
[2:30:31] it see this is what I'm meaning by this
[2:30:34] fighting fighting is making sure you
[2:30:36] know your ground making sure you know
[2:30:38] your weapon making sure you know it
[2:30:40] works and if the enemy comes in and says
[2:30:43] it's written you said yeah but it's
[2:30:44] written
[2:30:45] also yeah but it's written there and
[2:30:47] surely you said no it's not surely it's
[2:30:49] God word hallelujah because the thing is
[2:30:51] if you're trained in your sword and
[2:30:53] you're trained in your word you will not
[2:30:55] be deceived but if you're trained in
[2:30:57] music Lys and they say and the truth
[2:30:59] shall set you free I go where does it
[2:31:02] say set says the truth shall make you
[2:31:04] free it's a process set free is like I
[2:31:07] let you go and you're just gone now you
[2:31:09] can do whatever you want make free is
[2:31:11] we're going to have a bit of a rubbing
[2:31:14] session think about it but we accept it
[2:31:17] because it's been preached over all
[2:31:18] these songs and you think it's gospel
[2:31:20] but it's rubbish they sing Trinity
[2:31:22] Spirit they sing all these other things
[2:31:24] and we just eating it eating it father
[2:31:27] son no the father praise to the son
[2:31:29] praise to the praise to Jesus Christ
[2:31:31] amen who are you praising you're wasting
[2:31:34] your time don't be
[2:31:37] laabi stay in your
[2:31:40] word I'm about to close we're almost
[2:31:45] there aen didn't stay with the word and
[2:31:49] a whole campaign was fought and God said
[2:31:51] you will not lose one man but aen
[2:31:54] couldn't stay with the
[2:31:56] word he had clear
[2:31:58] instructions when you come to church be
[2:32:00] prayed up when you come here and you've
[2:32:03] got a besetting sin that you know you're
[2:32:05] doing you better strike that off because
[2:32:07] if somebody comes forward for prayer and
[2:32:09] they're not getting healed your
[2:32:13] fault I'm sorry your fault you got
[2:32:16] unconfessed you bring it into the camp
[2:32:19] people die
[2:32:23] you think God is going to turn a blind
[2:32:25] eye to that one day he will not but if
[2:32:28] you come here and you put your your your
[2:32:30] sin and you confess it and you put it
[2:32:31] under the blood and you start entering
[2:32:33] into the service people walk forward
[2:32:36] they get healed miracles happen because
[2:32:39] God respects the
[2:32:41] person CU he knows the guy that God you
[2:32:44] got real help and you in your position
[2:32:46] can really pray for that person and
[2:32:47] enter into their burden and you're so
[2:32:49] the spirit of God and God just moves
[2:32:51] over the place and then we have the
[2:32:53] brother Brandon meetings again where
[2:32:54] he's talking to the sister and he turns
[2:32:56] to the brother go hey you brother you've
[2:32:58] got so and so you believe God can heal
[2:33:01] yeah you're healed what did that brother
[2:33:03] brandom just the gift of healing it was
[2:33:06] God and brother brandham that did it I
[2:33:08] listened to those prayer lines and I
[2:33:10] just I just cannot believe how God can
[2:33:13] just come on a scene like that and there
[2:33:15] was unbelievers in there don't now take
[2:33:17] it as gospel hear me out but they didn't
[2:33:20] leave unbelievers and if they left
[2:33:21] unbelievers they missed the
[2:33:23] blessing but we as a church we should
[2:33:26] make sure that when we come here we're
[2:33:28] ready for
[2:33:29] battle because our heart is can my
[2:33:32] sister be healed can my brother be
[2:33:35] healed my heart before I walk into this
[2:33:38] church am I singing the right songs
[2:33:40] brother
[2:33:42] Josh is this the ones that God placed on
[2:33:44] my heart because all the songs was
[2:33:46] leading up to all these testimonies and
[2:33:48] he was opening a place where there was
[2:33:49] such an atmosphere that God can move am
[2:33:52] I in the right place delivering that
[2:33:55] then God will move in this place very
[2:33:58] mightily there's a difference I'm going
[2:34:00] to skip forward this is where brother
[2:34:02] brandom says that when you bring the
[2:34:04] sick before us they'll fail to be healed
[2:34:06] we need to call a solemn
[2:34:08] fast because something is wrong
[2:34:11] somewhere God made the promise God has
[2:34:14] to stick with the promise and he will do
[2:34:16] it so when we see stuff like that
[2:34:18] starting to happen us as Believers we
[2:34:20] should take a step back and go hold on
[2:34:23] Lord you got our taste cuz when 16 men
[2:34:25] died Joshua stopped the whole campaign
[2:34:28] they were already set in Array they all
[2:34:30] already everywhere they were advancing
[2:34:32] the enemy 16 men di Joshua goes hold on
[2:34:35] let's stop it let's get back stop stop
[2:34:38] stop the whole thing now you think
[2:34:40] you're on the battlefield starting
[2:34:41] fighting and and say stop what hold on
[2:34:46] and he walk back he goes sorry what's
[2:34:47] wrong 16 men die what what do you mean
[2:34:49] 16 men died we've been fighting a whole
[2:34:51] campaign not one got a scratch on him no
[2:34:53] Red Cross no bandages the anointing of
[2:34:56] God was the 16 men
[2:34:58] died they all were very sincere to find
[2:35:01] out what happened there and that's why
[2:35:02] they did it because they wanted to get
[2:35:05] that sin out of the camp now getting
[2:35:07] sent out of the camp is not removing
[2:35:08] people from under the blood getting sent
[2:35:10] out of the camp is not pointing fingers
[2:35:12] getting sent out of the camp is looking
[2:35:14] to the inside and go Lord what am I
[2:35:17] doing wrong here because you can't tell
[2:35:19] me if you look at a dead brother next to
[2:35:21] you go Lord was it me should I have
[2:35:23] covered him with my shield should I have
[2:35:25] my sword out was it what what killed him
[2:35:27] what was was it out of position was it
[2:35:29] supposed to be in my position if that is
[2:35:32] the attitude of the Christian he won't
[2:35:35] die so when we see people not being
[2:35:38] healed are we in position are we are we
[2:35:41] having our Shield of Faith up are we
[2:35:43] striking at the enemy or are we pitch
[2:35:45] walking to the guy next to us yeah he's
[2:35:46] not in position or maybe she's not in
[2:35:48] position oh and that one Wonder are we
[2:35:51] reflecting in here because if we could
[2:35:54] do that God could come back and say well
[2:35:57] let's Carry On We're All in the right
[2:35:58] place and people get healed and the
[2:36:01] gospel moves on we don't have to start
[2:36:02] back there at at the
[2:36:04] repentance we don't have to start again
[2:36:07] accepting the Lord Jesus Christ by faith

[2:39:39] vain he speaks about this
[2:39:42] um this little girl and I'll I'll tell
[2:39:46] you the story but it is it is also in
[2:39:48] the adoption series brother Brandon
[2:39:50] speaks about this little Goldie sorting
[2:39:52] or dating and uh brother Lee is the dad
[2:39:56] and uh he says to brother Ben to brother
[2:39:59] Mar Marion to brother um U Brandon wow
[2:40:04] think that brother brandom he says come
[2:40:07] and stay over the
[2:40:08] night and he says okay I'll come and
[2:40:10] stay over the night and the the girls
[2:40:12] are sleeping upstairs and the and him
[2:40:14] and brother Vale they they at the bottom
[2:40:15] sleeping there and brother Vale gets a
[2:40:18] dream
[2:40:20] and in this dream he dreams that he gets
[2:40:22] the blueprints of a house I wonder if I
[2:40:24] do I brother it can you put the
[2:40:25] blueprints of that house no let's do it
[2:40:27] I'll do this part we're going to read
[2:40:28] that and he says he gets this blueprints
[2:40:30] of the house and he looks at it being a
[2:40:33] contractor and he says the windows are
[2:40:37] wrong so he goes when we building the
[2:40:39] house he says no but before he does that
[2:40:41] he says to brother brandom I don't
[2:40:43] believe in the the baptism in the name
[2:40:45] of our Lord Jesus Christ I don't see it
[2:40:49] and and he leaves it and brother Brandon
[2:40:51] goes back with him and and he gets this
[2:40:54] dream and he look and he looks at this
[2:40:56] blueprint and he sees the windows is
[2:40:57] wrong and he goes and he changes the
[2:41:00] plan and he builds the house according
[2:41:02] to to the windows that he knows is right
[2:41:04] he says it's absolutely wrong building
[2:41:06] the windows that way this way is the
[2:41:07] better way and he builds this house he
[2:41:11] says he didn't believe it that he was a
[2:41:14] contractor he says brother brandom I
[2:41:15] have to read this too small maybe I can
[2:41:18] get it here he says yeah I just dreamed
[2:41:20] about it I dreamed that I went up near
[2:41:22] albery and there was a building in a
[2:41:23] man's house and it gave me a blueprint
[2:41:25] but when I seen a certain way the
[2:41:27] windows was cut and it fixed a certain
[2:41:29] place I said that's not right it just
[2:41:31] can't be right that's contrary that
[2:41:33] isn't right man's
[2:41:36] opinion he says but I built it the way I
[2:41:39] thought it was right and when he came
[2:41:41] back from Florida from his vacation he
[2:41:43] saw that the house was almost done and
[2:41:45] he looked at the house and he goes and
[2:41:47] he gets the blueprint and he looks at
[2:41:51] that children
[2:41:57] blueprint he looks at the blueprint he
[2:42:00] says sorry you've built my house
[2:42:05] wrong and I said to him no I haven't
[2:42:07] built your house wrong that is how it is
[2:42:09] in such and such a place he said well
[2:42:12] that's really don't belong there he said
[2:42:14] tear it down if you expect me to pay you
[2:42:18] you will build it way the blueprint
[2:42:22] said this is not games the Lord will
[2:42:25] come back one day we all will be judged
[2:42:29] according to what we've done here there
[2:42:31] will be a judging you get your judgment
[2:42:33] here and we know that in the white
[2:42:34] Throne judgment we may be right sitting
[2:42:36] next to him and and ministering upon a
[2:42:39] lot but brother brandham was standing
[2:42:40] for a message which Paul preached and he
[2:42:43] had to be judged and all of us was
[2:42:45] according to that message be careful
[2:42:47] when you leave the blue
[2:42:49] because the blueprint will get when the
[2:42:52] Lord comes back he says well done my
[2:42:55] true and faithful servant enter into
[2:42:56] joys of heaven or did he say you worker
[2:42:59] of iniquity I didn't know you because
[2:43:01] the blueprint is asking us to do a
[2:43:03] certain thing in a certain way it's not
[2:43:05] for us to interpret he says and then he
[2:43:08] speaks to brother Bram and brother Bram
[2:43:11] he says what do you think about that I
[2:43:13] said is there a creek
[2:43:15] running down there below the house and
[2:43:18] we went to it and I said I don't want
[2:43:20] tearing down on that day I will get it
[2:43:23] right now and put it according to the
[2:43:25] blueprint so if anybody fights you
[2:43:27] according to the blueprint if it's not
[2:43:30] written in this word it's man's opinion
[2:43:32] leave it alone amen but if it's in this
[2:43:36] blueprint stick with it because in the
[2:43:38] day of judgment this is the only thing
[2:43:40] that will stand for you is this word of
[2:43:42] God Amen so I encourage you when you
[2:43:44] come to service you can take that off
[2:43:46] there brother Ed and and it's been a
[2:43:48] such a mixed up service because I had to
[2:43:50] try to yank through a lot of things this
[2:43:53] church was built on a blueprint he says
[2:43:55] if you be
[2:43:57] humble people and you stay humble people
[2:44:00] will come and find their
[2:44:02] rest so if we can stay humble and we
[2:44:05] stay with the word of God people will
[2:44:07] send Souls here and they will be saved
[2:44:09] and they will go into the kingdom of God
[2:44:10] there will be all his work but let's not
[2:44:12] get out of the blueprint let's not
[2:44:14] forget that the little things make sense
[2:44:16] so kids I encourage you and especially
[2:44:18] you musos you you got the greatest
[2:44:20] battle on you because you musos don't
[2:44:24] let music take the part the the place of
[2:44:26] the word of God it is a gift it is not
[2:44:29] the word of God Amen maybe we'll just
[2:44:31] stand and we'll just pray together um I
[2:44:35] want to sing that song we sang last
[2:44:36] again touching Jesus so if you can start
[2:44:38] playing that please and uh we just pray
[2:44:42] say Lord Jesus is it's good to know that
[2:44:45] many of testimonies has come through
[2:44:47] this church father and and that we all a
[2:44:49] witness of your great love and mercy
[2:44:51] upon our life Lord but we also do know
[2:44:54] Lord that there's certain things that

[2:44:58] within the the message of our hour Lord

[2:45:03] walking with you and being in fellowship

[2:45:08] Lord and we thank you for revealing it
[2:45:09] to us we don't want to push any promise
[2:45:11] and and bring it to pass before you
[2:45:13] bring it to pass Lord but we just want
[2:45:15] to say Lord as we stay in the in the
[2:45:18] letter of your word father may you just
[2:45:20] always keep us in your hand father and
[2:45:22] guide us through that Promised Land we

[2:45:33] us right now Lord but you said be of a
[2:45:35] good courage go and fight cuz I will be
[2:45:38] there so we know that we lord we know
