Thank you for this atmosphere. Bless the musicians. [music] Bless the the pastor, Lord, that's open this pullpit for for someone to step in, Lord. And may that may that someone be you, Lord. May you just speak here. May you be the mouthpiece. May you deliver the message, Lord, [music] and and and and and tug on those hearts that need to be tugged. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much, musicians. Thank you, brother Fish. I think it's now the second time that I've I'm here as a first. So, as a first, Brother Fish has led us into some songs and some worship. It's awesome. I see myself as a privileged man. Thank you so much for um the privilege, Brother Ben, that I can be here. Um Josh, you can Oh, are you good there? &gt;&gt; Okay. Hey, &gt;&gt; you want to have this? I was just trying to um be technical and um all of the above. Um if you want to turn your Bibles to Deuteronomy 5:33, I need Yes, please. Deuteronomy 5 verse 33. Thank you. Amen. Who's had a good day? &gt;&gt; Good day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day closer to heaven. &gt;&gt; Let's read, shall we? You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess. May the Lord add the blessing to his words. You may have your seats. Um, the Lord's worked um on a thought. Who likes testimonies? I love testimonies. I really I really do love testimonies and um it is it's unique and it's personal and it's so no one can take it away from you. And that I like it's so it's so honest and so true. And the Lord said um he actually gave me a little photo. He he brought a photo in remembrance of my of my yes here and u [clears throat] I thought um maybe I should share a little bit of my testimony and a little bit of my path and from there we'll we'll bring it home as to as to speak. So, if you would allow me um to uh to I guess talk a little bit freely and just share a little thought and and and in particular this um uh this this memory I guess and the path how the Lord led me to to this point in my life. Um yeah, if you if you would be so gracious. So, one thing um brother Isaac, he's not here. Um but his sermon on confidence was was really good. Um brother Ben, you said it. It was a masterpiece. I I have to amen. It was really good. And um we've got we've got confidence in this word. We've got confidence in where we where we we stand, where we at there, where you sitting right now. You've got confidence in what the Lord's done in your life, what he's doing right now. And as long as you open your heart and let him work in you, um you'll you'll have even more confidence. Now, this is me. That's this is what I like to do sometimes. Um would a little fun fact. How many times do you think Brother Isaac said the word confidence or confident in his sermon? Anyone want to take a guess? Yes, Lilia. &gt;&gt; 150. &gt;&gt; 150. Very close. So the word confidence was 116 times. The word confident was 284. So those with quick maths 364 times he said the word confident or confidence including the title that I sneakily put in there. So almost one time a day for the entire year that you need to be confident and have confidence in this word. So thank you brother Isaac. I really enjoyed it. I started listening to it again and I was just it was really um uh insp um just inspired. Yes. Um prior to that, brother Isaac also um we we were talking about um his his prior service and he mentioned I think he was baptized when he was 12. Is that what he said? Yeah. So, and I thought, "Oh, yes. I think I was baptized when I was not baptized. I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 12." So with the knowledge that I have and the and the in the denomination where I was um you know I told him yeah no I think I was 12 as well. I remember I think it was 1992 and then I remembered there was this photo not a photo a little card that I had in my Bible of the date and I found it. So there is Ianodia where I lived in 1994. So I was 13. I wasn't 12 at that time and um in the in K is um here oh Dutch reformed K in Zanin and my dad was my was my counselor was um it just so happened that that there was an evening and there was a visiting minister and there was this tug of my heart and I thought I have to heed to this now long story short dad didn't I think there was a few people and he was uh uh running around to to sort of help and counsel and and pray with the other people. So, he didn't get around to me standing on the one side. But then afterwards when we left home, we sat down and I was in my room. He said, "Was there something that that happened? was it something that we, you know, and he came in and we sat and we actually filled this in at home which was which was for me it was special that uh we could do that and I thought um yeah um it was quite nice that I had this little this little thing in my Bible. So again with the knowledge that I had um and how it was presented to me this was a this was this was my first steps basically of of being a Christian. You probably can't read there at the top, but it says sort of uh this evening I've I've recognized or I've realized that Jesus Christ is my savior, my redeemer, and that he will forgive my sins and he will just redeem me from all the sins and uh he will he will um adopt me as his um and then he will never leave me nor forsake me which is which is awesome and I thought oh wow nice. Now coming back to the date 1994 I was 12 uh 13 sorry that means you got a testimony you young ones you're already working with your testimony you've got a testimony and it's powerful treasure it build on it protect it you know be m make it make it um don't hide it um be very um gracious what the Lord is doing in your life and this is this is where the bride starts moving. This is where um testimonies of the past come together where some of the bride at a particular date in their life what happens some events that was significant and then it brings you to to this present present hour. Now that was not the picture that the Lord brought to me to remembrance but this one was. Now that's that's us there as a team. I I did service here for Christ. Uh we called it DJC. Uh DJC. Yes. Yeah. But that was now in Africans for so um you were you was you were a servant or you you were did service for Jesus and uh through adventure through music through outreach in this case through drama and in this particular um case can you can you see where am I? Can can you should I should I make it quite obvious? &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; is it or is it Josh? I thought I could see a little bit of both in there. Anyway, they're definitely my sons. E, so [snorts] a little bit of background. This was this was in 2000. This was Y2K and I I did service year for Christ two years. This was my second year. And I always there was always drama around me. I was part of the drama team. But in this case, they made the drama team an outreach team as well. And there was always one team that will go outreach outside of South Africa and in this case in that particular instance we are sitting in Amsterdam and the previous year was in Russia. So I was actually quite excited if we can go back to Russia but then it changed and went we went to Amsterdam. So um very very special and I treasure moments like this where we served. Um, a little bit more detail is that obviously it costed a lot of money to get there and we just you know from South Africa with the rand it it was always hard to get all the funds and just before we left we we prayed and we fasted and I think it was about three days three days and three nights and from memory it was the last day that that Kristoff our leader oh I don't think he's in that photo um he said that we made we got all the funds and we as a team as a collective we could all go um on the outreach which was which was awesome. So what I'm trying to say is from a young age testimonies came and and nothing like that could change. You know I remember him showing us how much do we owe him saying hey this is this is what the scripture says. Let's do this. We got together every time the the team ate and we were there at the hookie. So that was in Ptoria. So um and and I'll get now to why I'm pointing there. um we they would eat dinner and lunch and whatever and we'll gather together we'll and we'll pray and and just have our minds on this and yes that's the evidence of that we made it there um so yes so it was this this photo that came to remembrance and at that moment I how my mind works is like the location I map the location oh where was this yes this was in in um Amsterdam in a place called the cliff. Now there's the cliff. So any of you that's been in Amsterdam before? Ah, Omar is here. God bless you, Omar. Oh, nice. Okay, so if I say Dalan, that's it's a it's a little rocky place. This is the end. I like to say this is the end of the red light district actually. And you're looking towards the the red light district. So if you don't know what's a red light district, may young ones, may your parents enlighten you. Now there were paths to to this cliff uh that we could take and obviously we could go through the red light district. We try to prevent that as much as possible. It broke your heart when you walk through there. So the cleft was there for those that was a safe haven for people that's had a bad background that's not just bums but just had a history of of really being uh taken advantage of and and really abused and um so this was actually a very very special place the cliff I was actually very surprised when I could find that on on Google maps Now, the main aim, and I'll I'll go back here, cuz you'll see what we we're busy doing. Um, we're busy making some some lunch. We busy preparing some sandwiches with ham. And is it is it peanut sauce? What do you call in in Dutch? You had that special peanut butter. &gt;&gt; There we go. Pinda Pinda sauce or pindagas. Yeah. Um, which people loved. So that's me with the knife there with some with that on my on my knife. Um we prepared lunch and so the one mission was to just play some games with these people that didn't have place to go or maybe has been um abused or just want to get away from life. Now for us here's our safe haven. Here we get together. Here we can have fellowship. For them they didn't have a outcome. Oh, and then just across the street is that big church. Uh oh, I can't remember the name, but it's it's a massive church. Um there's actually a lot of churches around in in Amsterdam, which is which is amazing. Um so our mission was to sit and play chess, get out a board game or something like that, just play with them, just talk with them. Uh and then there was one of the rules was you never never speak about the Bible. You never talk about the Bible or Christendom or anything like that which forced you to be the life that forced you to be here's the testimony. I'm preaching the gospel with what you see in front of you. So again very special to us that that we could have a time like that. And then if I go back to that photo of the cliff you will see little steps going up on the right. And that photo of what we've been preparing is just past that glass. And by then there's there at the bottom there's some steps uh some a basin basement and we'll we'll get together we'll split the teams. So those that's at the top that's busy with um with the people and so we've got the other team that's praying for us for praying for the people that's busy upstairs to stand in the gap and give us an opportunity. And so so we we did this and this was uh two or three months that we that we would do this once a week or so. So very very special and yeah there I just sort of put the put the two together. Now rewind. Oh, did I miss now? Oh my I missed one photo. Sorry. Okay. There's one photo that is from 1999. So it was basically a year before this year prior this with this uh long a photo of taken in Marcelsport. Now we're back in South Africa and this long string of cars, this long convoy of cars and comies and utes and everything and we are on our way to to somewhere and in that convoy was none other than sister Lundy was one in one of those comies with me but not with me just with service here. And I'll share this for you. Right here at the bottom is where that convoy was. It's called Marcel Sport. It's very close to Bloom Fontaine. And I started thinking, ooh, Bloom Fontaine. That's not too far from where by the Arman Shantel lived. And I started putting all these little pictures together or where would they have been at this time. [clears throat] This is about December December uh 1999. So the second um little circle there is Tennison as where brother Arman grew up and the third one right at the top is Valkum was where sister Shantel was. So all amongst this at that very time we were about 120 kilometers uh apart. So they're highlighted there at the top right. So just from another n from another angle here's Marcus right at the bottom left and then tion and valkum. Now all of a sudden when I started playing with the maps I'm going oh but that's porch and is is sister puling not from porch. So I go that &gt;&gt; hey &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; oh the previous slide. Oh well there we go. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; So, and that's that that's what triggered this thought. I I go, we are all from here. Tolly, you want to put up that little video and I'll show you what the whole aim was? No. So there's Valk from Tennison to Valk and then from Valk we've got Joberg you know the mile and a lot brother MO and then from Joberg we had Nigeria and we had even Nairobi and people there all the other way on the other side of the globe we've got uh family from uh from uh South Korea coming back and all of them ends up here here in in crazy Willington. Thank you. Is that all right? I've got a big head. So, uh yeah, we'll have to work on that. That's all right. It'll make it work. So, so the whole just by that I just wanted to show that from a from a globe and I wish I could just get all these little uh uh lines drawn that's coming from all walks of life, all cultures. We didn't know a bar of soap from each other and now we ended up here. Now, if we can flip back to that. Um, yes, thank you, Tia. If um, what I want to show there is the path. The path. Everyone's got a path. Everyone's the Lord's chosen a path for you and you are walking it. And you don't know sometimes why. You don't know sometimes when and where and how did I end up here? What what's the reason for this? It's not always negative, but like how the Lord physically took us and my path where I was still in South Africa where we did some outreach. I was even thinking about Hillbrow. So the previous year 1999 we did the outreach in Hilbrow Hillbrow Joberg Center. Joberg um you wake up with gunshots and people dead in the street and you know it was quite quite real. We got shot on as well. Um there was a we came from a church and um yeah so anyway but some [sighs] we we were there to just give a little bit of a light just be a little bit of hope you know um children that's at a at a early childhood center they get dropped off 6:00 in the morning maybe they get picked up that night you know it's one of those that and you the only little glimmer of hope all I did for one day I remember was just the the boys running around actually boys and girls running around this crash and I'll grab them and I'll yank them and then you know on the monkey bars or throw them or do something. I was tired. I was phys. I couldn't feel my arms. They just wanted that physical that interaction that touch that hey there's someone that's not hurting me. Here's someone that's loving me, you know. And it's um what we what we have is just tremendous. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So sometimes I feel like this this is my life. I feel like the big old burnt stump, a lot of lot of ashes and everything around me. So there's a lot of uh a death that had to happen. But then through that all you have this this little green that comes out that the little uh a path that changes you know a season that changes. So from our physical path is obviously in our spiritual journey we've got the same. So how many times that we stop and wonder and ask God why did this happen? Why here? Why New Zealand? Why do we come here? you know, my thought of why we're coming to New Zealand and the Lords were were polar opposites. And um so I I guess he had a bit of a giggle when when you think, you know, oh yeah, this Ed, he's he's coming here to, you know, save the world and be a role model for whoever, you know, like no, this is where I'm going to start with your journey to becoming a man of God, to becoming a a a a husband, to become a a priest, a prophet, a someone that that that's steadfast in in the walk um of the Lord. So we all come to the same place. So we all come from all over the world but we come spiritually to the same place. That bride that's adorned in white that seat at the table that meeting in the air that is where we're coming um together [clears throat] as Christians as the bride as a body of believers. So we are you had to go on this certain path. You had to walk this walk. You had to uh cross paths with people. Maybe you had to uh stop maybe so that people can seed or sew a seed in your life, you know. Um you could get to a point where uh where he wanted he wants you uh he wants you to get to a to a point in your life where he wants you and then that certain character can be built and that's it and and you can be formed and developed even further. What what came to mind in that in that in that moment where of the refining and the and the and the character building and how the Lord is shaping and forming us through our paths and where we have to go for a certain reason and talk to people and and interact and fellowship is that that that Jesus was God made manifest and through that. So he wanted to he is pressing now to become that in us. &gt;&gt; He wants to be God manifest. He wants to manifest himself through your life. &gt;&gt; And bec you have to do this journey. You know, whether you like it or not, you have to go because the Lord wants you at a certain point in your life to be unique enough to be a personality and everything that comes together, that beautiful bouquet of flowers to talk to someone to to to to have a channel or opportunity to say, you know, Ed, he's he's he's meant to talk to this little Johnny at this moment in time. their crosswalk path at this moment in time. His character will be built and his and his life will be such a such a place and such a testimony that it will impact little Johnny no with the sisters as well. Um and brother Brandham talks about this. know I I I was busy with uh life path of life the path of life the the the and and it and it sort of struck me um I wasn't listening to it for this uh sermon but it was so so fitting he was talking about um a letter that someone wrote to him 22 pages very critical saying um didn't address him as brother or anything like that or just respectful it was just saying Brandham and he was talking about his grammar. He was talking about even the fact that he said that Satan couldn't heal and and it was just taking him on, you know. Now, look at the path that he has to take now. So, so listen now to what I'm saying in terms of physically and and spiritually the path he's taking. He's receiving this 22 pager and going through that. And he replies now and he responds just with two pages. And within that two pages he said to the best of his abilities he was you know scratching as he says and he was he was trying to to to incorporate and give some love. So he's come now from a path from 33 to about I think it was 62 or something this message that he had to take to get to this point &gt;&gt; to be able to write this letter but not to to to write this letter to get now a response back saying I we invite you come &gt;&gt; now it's changed now there was this very critical to oh wait a minute he's human he wants he's he's talking he's he's there's there's something in him and he goes and fellowships with them and they get they have questions they're from this Lutheran college and the deans got question and the brother asked for forgiveness that he had this 22 pager written you know and brother Brham forgave him immediately and said I will never hold this against you prayed at that at that college um and and there was a particular order that he told them cuz they wanted to have the Holy Ghost. They were asking this Pentecostals is jumping up and down. What do they have? And he said the Holy Ghost. Now this Lutheran, what do they have? And he said the Holy Ghost. And they they were they were now stunned. How? Why? How? So we want the Holy Ghost. And he gave them a a an instruction. And at that point, 40 of them at that time received the Holy Ghost right there. So that's someone with a sincere heart. And that's someone looking from this Lutheran and the journey that he took, the path that he took and the you know maybe a a different spirit that was on him. But then that sincerity came and something struck the heart and there was a tug and he said uh he's changed his mind. Please forgive me. Show me how can I have this this uh uh baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, and I think he said something like they went on to be 500 um strong that that was that was baptized uh uh and and received the Holy Ghost. So, praise the Lord for that. And just to refer back to uh a little story in the from the Bible um Simeon. So this is from the message I think expectation. Yes. Says yes Lord. He laid it down. So uh it'll color in the picture. That was the voice of the Holy Ghost. I can hear Simeon say up. Start walking. Where Lord? Just walk. I'll take care of the rest. How am I going to walk um after I get out of the stretcher? I don't know. He will take care of the rest. See, just start walking when he tells you. How am I going to get up out of this wheelchair? How am I going to get over cancer and heart trouble? How am I going to tell my mother if I get the Holy Ghost and my daddy? They belong in a different church. Just get it. He will take care of the rest. You see, you don't have to worry about that. He will take care of it. You How am I going to face school and my playmates? Don't worry. Just keep going. He will take care of that. &gt;&gt; Simeon raises up and there he starts not knowing where's he going, just walking. But the Holy Ghost is directing his steps. Don't you believe men are led by the spirit of God? They that are the sons of God asks. Is that right? Here he comes not knowing where is he going, but he's led by the spirit of God. He moves over into that line of circumcision coming down his mother. Here he stand he starts walking down not knowing where's he going. The Holy Ghost is leading him. And the Holy Ghost brought him right straight before this little despised mother standing there with this baby sat swaddling cloth. I can hear the Holy Ghost say, "This is it." He reached over and got the baby in his arms, took it to Mary's arms, tears rolling down a a white beard, said, "Lord, let thy servant depart in peace according to thy word, for my eyes have seen thy salvation." That's right. the word spurnt out but and and that man loved it. The same thing today the the world uh spurns the baptism of the spirit and the works of the Holy Ghost but there's hungry hearts that's coming to it and moving to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now look the same Holy Ghost not there's no two Holy Spirits there's only one. And the same Holy Spirit that gave um Simeon that promise is the same Holy Spirit that's drawn you out here tonight. He made you come, sister, and to you, sister. And you and you and you and all of you that's here tonight in Shik Shikina tabernacle. He brought you here. The devil would never bring you around a place like this. I'll guarantee you that the Holy Ghost brought you here. If you believe in divine healing, then the Holy Spirit brought you where the fountains open just like he did Simeon. You embraced God's promise like Simeon did. Now, as the musicians would come, that's good. I didn't want to b you too long and I didn't want to share too much of my of my testimony. I'll give you just little um little nuggets, you know, so to keep you curious. But now we are the ones that are pointing the way. We are the ones showing the signs. We are the ones throwing a pebble into the water so it starts rippling. Someone else is on this path. Someone else is on their own little journey that they need to get here and come here. And throughout your own life together with the Lord, they were ones that helped you to get where you are today. So now remember young ones and older ones. I mean brother Colin is young because he started now in the youth band. Your life is a testimony. It is important. No one can change your story. It is lifech changing. So go and preach the gospel with your life. Amen. And God bless you. May we have a time of prayer. It's definitely needed. Uh we are a needy people and I think uh Satan knows his days are numbered. &gt;&gt; So may we really enter I I really enjoy our prayer uh evenings here. I really feel like we are entering in and we we are we are leaving here victorious every time there's an answer to prayer. So let us sing a song and I'll invite um brother Ben for the fish you can come up. Um, I'll invite Brother Ben to just go through the go through the um prayer requests. Um, what song shall we sing?

I went to the high school right across the road from where from a you know, the gospel tape ministry there in Gisbon, you know, where that was the mecca of the message in New Zealand. I was going to school right there. I was in Gisbon probably kicking around where the leaves were somewhere without even knowing it, you know, but God had his hand on us all and he's guided us and amen. Praise God for that. Amen.
