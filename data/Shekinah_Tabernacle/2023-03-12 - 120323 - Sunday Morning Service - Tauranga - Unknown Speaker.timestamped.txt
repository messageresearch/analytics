[1:34] brother Ben the ability to you have to
[1:37] step aside this morning that your Holy
[1:39] Spirit may be able to come down and Lord
[1:41] break the chains of bondage that would
[1:43] be holding us back from entering into
[1:46] the complete Liberty of Jesus Christ
[1:49] Lord for we know that that is what you
[1:52] have for us as Liberty and freedom or
[1:55] God and I just pray for a freedom of

[4:47] have a message from the Lord
[4:52] [Music]
[4:59] right and we have a technical glitch
[5:02] here we go we've got it
[5:04] [Music]
[5:06] man I've a message from the Lord
[5:16] I'll give you it's recorded in his words
[6:25] Hallelujah
[6:27] it is
[6:49] today
[6:54] look and live my brothers
[7:15] look and live my brother lives look to
[7:22] Jesus
[7:30] foreign
[7:37] amen we thank the Lord that the gospel
[7:39] message is so simple just look to Jesus
[7:42] and live
[7:44] amen I thirsted in a Barren land
[7:49] let's sing this one this morning
[7:51] [Music]
[7:54] hi thirsted in a Barren land of sin and
[7:59] shame and nothing
[8:02] satisfying there I found
[8:06] the Blessed Cross of Christ
[8:32] a wonderful and beautiful
[8:48] have Glory Grace and blessing Mark the
[8:52] path of trouble I'm shouting Hallelujah
[8:56] every day
[9:26] a thousand there is
[9:53] looking at the Springs of Living
[9:56] Waters
[10:03] amen praise the Lord now you may be
[10:06] seated this morning
[10:11] I was just wondering does anybody have a
[10:14] testimony this morning for the glory of
[10:15] God maybe something the Lord's been
[10:17] doing in your life
[10:21] no takers
[10:23] I can maybe break the ice a little bit
[10:27] um I just want to thank the Lord that
[10:29] he continues to give opportunity to
[10:31] witness and I have had some
[10:34] opportunities recently to witness to a
[10:37] number of people about the coming of the
[10:39] Lord
[10:41] um and it's it's been really encouraging
[10:43] for me it's it's almost like a Drogo I
[10:46] just want to find more people to share
[10:48] the word of God with because
[10:50] this world is heading for an absolute
[10:53] train wreck and the only answer is the
[10:57] coming of the Lord and I mean you have
[11:00] to use a bit of a discernment of course
[11:01] but if you really kind of fall into that
[11:05] channel and you find hearts that are
[11:07] willing
[11:08] it can be life-changing you may not see
[11:10] it straight away but when I've shared
[11:12] the word they've received it and we
[11:15] don't know
[11:16] what might happen to that person but the
[11:19] word of God's a seed Saints and
[11:22] we just trust it if I was in the good
[11:24] ground so I just want to thank the Lord
[11:26] for that I think we have an obligation
[11:28] to tell people because
[11:31] there's an oncoming judgment and there's
[11:34] there's a shaking coming like that's
[11:36] going to make turkey and some of these
[11:39] great earthquakes look like nothing and
[11:42] I think sometimes we need to shake
[11:45] ourselves
[11:46] and and realize one of these days 1400
[11:50] miles of coastline is going to sink
[11:52] and and we don't want to I don't want to
[11:55] see my friends my family my associates
[11:57] go through that and I don't want to see
[12:00] people
[12:01] you know the dad comes to me and say why
[12:03] don't you tell me I I think we we need
[12:05] to warn people and and tell them he's
[12:08] coming amen he's coming real soon
[12:11] so
[12:13] we just praise the Lord for the message
[12:14] of the hour that's that's warned us
[12:16] about these things amen
[12:20] so I hope I've inspired somebody maybe
[12:22] not
[12:24] does um does anybody have any prayer
[12:26] requests this morning spoken or unspoken
[12:31] yeah
[12:32] one of my some of our friends
[12:35] a woman's name is Candice and she's very
[12:38] sick with something shaking the whole
[12:41] body is shaking for the past 12 months
[12:43] and the doctors are getting no hope and
[12:45] it looks like that could just get worse
[12:48] until she dies right and I told him that
[12:50] I'll play for it oh that we'll pray for
[12:52] her sure
[12:54] the Lord is the only hope

[34:16] your seats uh this morning and I want to
[34:18] I want to speak about I want to pose a
[34:21] question and and we know the answer to
[34:23] this question but I want to ask the
[34:24] question can there be another revival
[34:26] can there be another Revival you know we
[34:29] find ourselves uh you know brother
[34:31] Brandon would identify where we are
[34:33] currently as as the disciples here on
[34:36] the way from from one side of the Sea of
[34:39] Galilee to the other to the to the to
[34:41] the country of the gadarines now on the
[34:42] Gatherings there was we know there were
[34:44] tombs there there was not just a Maniac
[34:46] in the Tomb but there was there was the
[34:48] there was the dead there and and you
[34:49] know we understand that we're traveling
[34:51] you know our our journey will ultimately
[34:53] take us to the dead in Christ will race
[34:55] right so we're on a journey in a ship
[34:57] Jesus is in your ship I trust he's in
[34:59] your ship today and if he's not you can
[35:00] call him on the scene and he'll come
[35:02] into your ship you know it's amazing how
[35:04] the very one that can save us is the
[35:05] very one we're afraid of right you know
[35:07] there's another account in the gospels
[35:09] where where Jesus sent them you know to
[35:11] to travel in their ship to you know the
[35:14] other side of the lake and he and he
[35:15] waited on the other side and that night
[35:16] when they were trying to row and they
[35:18] were rowing against the window weren't
[35:19] getting anywhere and they saw him and
[35:20] they thought he was a spirit on the
[35:22] water and the Very one that could help
[35:24] them in their ship they were afraid of
[35:25] and they're very worried that God has
[35:27] sent in this age people are afraid of
[35:29] because it's the Lord Jesus Christ and
[35:30] it's amazing when you look at the first
[35:32] time fear ever gripped man was in the
[35:35] Garden of Eden after the fall Adam never
[35:37] knew what it was like to be afraid until
[35:39] he heard that voice he heard the voice
[35:41] of God walking in the garden and they
[35:43] tried to cover their sin with the Fig
[35:44] leaves and you know the story about the
[35:46] first time fear man ever felt fear was
[35:49] when his God came to have fellowship
[35:51] with him but because of sin I mean they
[35:54] were afraid of him but we shouldn't be
[35:55] afraid of him this morning he's here to
[35:57] come into our storm he's here to come
[35:58] you know I'm so thankful we can awaken
[36:00] him in our boat he may be asleep but if
[36:03] he's in your ship you can awaken him and
[36:05] if he's but if he's not in your ship
[36:07] he's walking on the water of your life
[36:08] to come and step into your boat but
[36:10] you've got to invite him in I mean so so
[36:12] we're much like the disciples where they
[36:14] would they would be you know brother
[36:15] Brown would dramatize it and he would
[36:17] speak about how how when he was asleep
[36:19] in the back of the ship the disciples as
[36:20] they were rowing the boat they would
[36:22] they would begin to talk and testify of
[36:24] what they had just seen the Living God
[36:26] do and you know they would they would
[36:27] get up one after the other and say you
[36:29] know I can't you know it's so amazing to
[36:30] see that crippled man just get up and
[36:32] how he took the Bro bread and the fish
[36:34] you know break it and feed the people
[36:36] and you know then maybe John would get
[36:38] up and give a testimony and Peter would
[36:39] interrupt and give his testimony and
[36:41] tell everyone to be quiet and you know
[36:43] you're because they were feasting on the
[36:44] results of a great Revival that they
[36:47] just had and brother Brahm says in
[36:49] calling Jesus on the scene this is this
[36:51] is a 19th 63 he says he says that
[36:54] something like us today those disciples
[36:56] out there on that ship that night after
[36:58] the Revival they were feasting on the
[37:00] results now maybe between revivals now
[37:02] we're looking for another stir where
[37:04] there's got to be something happen now
[37:06] that will gather the church together
[37:08] there's got to be some kind of a press
[37:10] God always does it that way to run as
[37:12] people together I believe it's already
[37:13] being formed that will shut out
[37:16] everything that won't agree with them
[37:17] and then it's going to be run the church
[37:19] together and we're waiting for that to
[37:21] happen and we're living on the results
[37:22] of the great Revival that we've just
[37:25] passed and he is resting now remember
[37:27] Christ was in the ship with them the
[37:29] word was there with them so so we have
[37:32] we're not looking for God to open his
[37:33] word further we don't need an eighth
[37:35] messenger the seventh has come the
[37:37] mystery of God is finished right so
[37:38] we're not looking for another Prophet to
[37:40] come on the scene and open the scripture
[37:41] it's already happened just like Christ
[37:43] they weren't looking for Christ to come
[37:45] he was already in the boat amen so but
[37:47] but he must be awakened now now we are
[37:50] living off the the result adults were
[37:52] facing off the receipt
[37:54] um we're facing on the results of
[37:56] Revival yeah even even if we you know we
[37:58] go back 50 years The World Is Still
[38:00] feasting off the results of the post
[38:01] World War II healing Revival where that
[38:03] swept the world and churches were
[38:05] birthed and people came into the kingdom
[38:06] the power of God was poured out brother
[38:08] Brahm initiated that Revival history
[38:09] tells us but then we can even come
[38:12] forward to when the message came into
[38:13] this country there was a great Revival
[38:14] that swept the country right and then
[38:16] you can even bring it down to your life
[38:17] when he met you there was a Revival you
[38:20] were awakened you're Once Dead and
[38:21] trespasses and sins thinking you're from
[38:23] New Zealand or from some country but
[38:25] then when he came your way and opened
[38:27] your eyes you realize I'm actually a son
[38:29] or daughter of God I came from God and
[38:31] I'm going back to God you had a Revival
[38:33] because a Revival means an Awakening it
[38:36] means I've trust you've been awakened to
[38:38] the fact you're not this you know child
[38:41] of your parents you're a son or daughter
[38:43] of God Amen because when you are
[38:45] awakened you begin you begin to live
[38:47] different you begin to act different
[38:48] because you realize who your parent
[38:50] really is what your main not this not
[38:53] this body but your soul I mean it came
[38:55] from God it's going back to God
[38:57] so they can be a mighty Revival who had
[38:59] that guy I trust you had that kind of
[39:00] time in your Christian walk where God
[39:02] became alive you saw a little you know
[39:04] it wasn't a just just an intellectual
[39:07] Revival
[39:08] because the thing is the disciples no
[39:10] doubt they begin to talk about the you
[39:13] know because it wasn't just the Miracles
[39:15] they would have talked about but what
[39:16] Jesus was teaching and they began to
[39:18] discuss The Parables back and forth and
[39:21] it's amazing when you get men together
[39:22] and they look forget who's with them
[39:24] they begin to have disagreements one
[39:26] with the other and no doubt they were
[39:28] rowing and you know when you're rowing a
[39:30] boat you need to all be rowing in unison
[39:32] otherwise you start going in circles
[39:35] whoever tried to roll a boat well even
[39:36] yourself you've got to have the ores
[39:37] together you can't go like this
[39:39] otherwise you start going like this
[39:40] right and you know so so they had to be
[39:42] rowing in unison but you know no doubt
[39:44] you know maybe one of the disciples said
[39:46] something about a parable and maybe
[39:48] Peter because you know Peter was always
[39:49] quick on the trigger you say brother I
[39:51] just don't see it that way you know I
[39:53] don't believe Jesus put that emphasis on
[39:54] that quote like that and you know I just
[39:56] you know I you know I think you're
[39:58] barking up the wrong tree and I don't
[39:59] agree with this kind of Doctrine and
[40:00] maybe he got us all out maybe maybe
[40:02] splash the disciple with the oil you
[40:05] know that he was disagreeing with them
[40:06] you know what happened a fuss in a fight
[40:08] started them in the boat and this is
[40:10] sadly what has happened down from since
[40:12] the prophet's been here down into this
[40:14] day people have risen up there's been
[40:16] eighth Messengers specialty doctrines
[40:17] whatever you've got to listen to certain
[40:19] preachers to go on the Rapture all kind
[40:20] of nonsense you know and what's happened
[40:22] it's caused a fuss and a fight in the
[40:24] bride of Christ and people have picked
[40:27] up their rules and and and and their
[40:28] focus is not getting to the other side
[40:30] to bring a resurrection amen of the of
[40:33] the Dead Saints their whole focus is
[40:35] using their or or the quotes and the
[40:37] scriptures that are together as a weapon
[40:39] to try and take out the others I pray
[40:42] none of us are in this boat or in that
[40:44] category right but you know this is
[40:46] sadly what has happened the disciples
[40:48] took their Vision off the master said
[40:50] we've got to go to the other side he
[40:52] said let's go to the other side there's
[40:53] a reason why the Lord wanted them to go
[40:55] there because we know the maniac was in
[40:57] the Tomb right and there's a reason why
[40:59] God has us on our path is because the
[41:01] dead in Christ must rise we've got to
[41:03] get to a certain part of our journey
[41:05] then they're going to come out of the
[41:06] grave and we're going to be caught up
[41:07] with them to meet the Lord in the air
[41:09] that's our Focus that's our goal right
[41:11] the grave is not our goal the sky is our
[41:13] goal amen so that should be our focus
[41:15] and everything we do like brother MSM
[41:17] was saying testifying to family is bird
[41:18] no God bless your Zeal brother Emerson
[41:20] amen so I really appreciated that you
[41:23] know why because he sees the goal the
[41:25] judgment's coming but there's always a
[41:27] way God always gives a way of Escape
[41:28] before the Judgment strikes you know
[41:31] just like Jesus would tell the Disciples
[41:33] of Matthew 24 he says when you see
[41:34] armies can pass around Jerusalem
[41:36] basically Flee for Your Life you know
[41:39] don't even get your stuff just just run
[41:41] and he was prophesying of when Titus
[41:44] would come and surround the city because
[41:46] he knew he was going to be rejected he
[41:47] knew he's going to be crucified and he
[41:49] knew judgment was going to come upon
[41:51] Jerusalem because they rejected the word
[41:53] the Messiah and so so he told them when
[41:56] you see these things flee and so now the
[41:58] believer now wasn't caught up in the
[42:00] politics and the religious nonsense
[42:02] going on in the day they held on to the
[42:04] words of life and then when G then when
[42:07] they saw the Romans come around they
[42:09] weren't caught up with the zealots and
[42:10] this Pharisees and all those guys who
[42:12] are trying to make a religious political
[42:15] move to to renew the nation they held on
[42:17] to the words of the Messiah and when
[42:19] they saw the Romans surround Jerusalem
[42:21] they ran for their life and history
[42:23] apparently says it not one true
[42:25] Christian was caught we're caught in
[42:27] Jerusalem when Titus came in a massacred
[42:29] the place why because they held on to
[42:31] the words of the Lord but the lord gave
[42:33] a way of Escape he said there's a
[42:36] judgment coming but I'm giving you a
[42:37] warning that you can flee you have a
[42:39] place of safety to go to and I'm so
[42:41] thankful we have a place of safety right
[42:43] now and it's not a hill up you know it's
[42:45] not the mountain it's not some Hill up
[42:47] here somewhere but as Jesus Christ
[42:49] himself is our place of safety that we
[42:52] can go to and it's whosoever will you
[42:54] you can go in amen it doesn't matter
[42:56] what state you're in or where you've
[42:57] been or what you've done or what you've
[42:59] said or what life you've lived that's
[43:00] irrelevant amen there is a place of
[43:03] safety you can go to this morning amen
[43:05] I'm so thankful when Jesus gave the
[43:07] parable of the wedding supper he said
[43:10] get the good and the bad get the lame
[43:12] get the Hulk get the get the
[43:14] even if they can't just just pack them
[43:16] in yeah BCS get the good and the bad so
[43:19] I'm glad I'm so thankful when he said
[43:20] the bad it means I I could come amen
[43:23] hallelujah I have a place in there I you
[43:25] know I can get in the door
[43:27] Hallelujah and what I love about it is
[43:29] in the old um you know Jewish custom it
[43:32] didn't matter if you're the richest
[43:33] person in the world or the poorest
[43:35] person in the world a homeless person
[43:37] when you when you came through the door
[43:39] your feet were washed you're Anointed
[43:41] with oil your um your perfume and so on
[43:43] you're made welcome and you're given a
[43:45] new robe
[43:46] so after you've walked through the door
[43:48] everyone looked the same you could have
[43:51] you could be Elon Musk or you could be
[43:53] someone who's homeless but you'd be
[43:54] wearing the same kind of rope you'd look
[43:56] exactly the same on the outside because
[43:58] you've come through the door it's the
[44:00] same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:01] when you repent to baptize the name of
[44:03] Jesus Christ for mission of sin you
[44:05] receive the Holy Ghost you put on that
[44:07] robe Hallelujah you look all the same we
[44:10] look all the same Amy but there's a way
[44:11] of Escape now here they were they were
[44:14] they were arguing and fussing there in
[44:16] the boat and they did not realize that
[44:18] storm a storm was coming now I don't
[44:21] know if any of you maybe brother Emerson
[44:22] has and anyone else who loves to be on
[44:24] the water but you know being who's ever
[44:26] been caught in a storm on the ocean all
[44:28] right well the martu has is a few here
[44:30] you know it's it's it's amazing when it
[44:34] catches your unawares you know I
[44:35] remember one time this is when my
[44:37] parents they lived in Papua New Guinea
[44:39] and I was I was there in the Christmas
[44:40] season and in the Christmas season over
[44:42] there they have a monsoon season so they
[44:44] don't have winter they have they have
[44:46] monster sooner or or dry season now in
[44:49] the monsoon season it can be very Dead
[44:51] Calm and then gusts will come and it'll
[44:53] start blowing like a gale they'll just
[44:55] start pouring down with rain
[44:57] and I was sailing at catamaran which is
[44:59] a two-man boat and it was just me myself
[45:01] and actually when you sell it you meant
[45:02] to wear a harness to lean out you
[45:03] actually literally only your toes are
[45:05] actually in the boat when you're sailing
[45:06] it but I didn't have a harness I didn't
[45:08] have a crew man I was just myself in a
[45:10] boat which was for two and then I was
[45:12] sailing in the bay it was all I did look
[45:14] nice and then a gust came
[45:16] and then another gust came and then the
[45:18] gusts got closer together I didn't heed
[45:20] the warning see warnings were coming
[45:22] this this the monsoon rain is coming you
[45:25] better get into Shore I didn't heed the
[45:26] warning I was just enjoying the sunshine
[45:28] thinking life is just going to go on as
[45:29] it always has right but then suddenly
[45:31] the gusts came together and just a big
[45:33] one came and then the boat was capsized
[45:35] I couldn't get it back up and I had to
[45:38] wait for the thing actually to be pushed
[45:40] onto the shore to get it back up and get
[45:42] get to safety
[45:43] now the reason I say that is because if
[45:46] I really knew what I was doing I'd
[45:47] realize the first gas would come because
[45:49] I knew where I was I was in monsoon
[45:51] season I was in the tropics I was
[45:53] sailing a boat racks you need two people
[45:54] but I thought I can do it myself and how
[45:56] many people think in this world they can
[45:58] live they can they can sell life solemn
[46:01] Maine by themselves I can do it I know
[46:03] what I'm doing I've done this before I'm
[46:04] a professional just like the disciples
[46:07] they lived they would have cut their
[46:08] teeth on the on the on the rail of the
[46:11] boat of their parents boat of their
[46:13] dad's fishing ship they knew exactly
[46:14] what it was like to be on the Sea of
[46:15] Galilee they knew all how the weather
[46:17] was they knew exactly they knew that sea
[46:20] like the back of their hand
[46:22] so it's amazing how you know the storm
[46:24] began to grow began to brew and then
[46:26] they begin to think we can handle this
[46:28] we can handle the storm we can we can
[46:31] handle this thing sure they were fussing
[46:32] and fighting and but you know when
[46:34] storms begin to come it it changes our
[46:36] Focus yeah I trust it should stay change
[46:39] your focus yo there's got to be a change
[46:41] Among Us I'm talking about myself
[46:43] especially we can't just plow on as we
[46:45] always have there's a change in season
[46:47] here right now amen where it's time to
[46:50] stop hitting each other with oars
[46:52] don't fortify ourselves anymore with
[46:55] quotes and scriptures and just stay
[46:57] there like a bunker you know bunkers are
[46:59] dingy places I've been in you know where
[47:01] my parents were the Japanese had their
[47:03] headquarters for World War II and I've
[47:05] been in so Admiral Yamamoto was the
[47:07] leader of the Japanese forces there in
[47:09] that part of the Pacific I've been in it
[47:10] in his bunker it's dingy it's low
[47:14] ceiling it's not a nice place to live
[47:16] but because of Warren things they had to
[47:18] build the bunker But but so don't build
[47:20] a bunker out of quotes and scriptures
[47:21] and say this is my position this is how
[47:23] I'm going to be always put a comma after
[47:25] what you believe and keep walking see
[47:27] God doesn't want us in a bunker thinking
[47:29] I'm fine and I'm just going to hide away
[47:31] from things going on and these people
[47:33] are doing this and this trouble forget
[47:34] all that stuff God wants us to walk in
[47:36] his Green Green Pastures besides Still
[47:39] Waters Hallelujah
[47:41] amen so so here they were the storm
[47:43] began to brew now brother man says yo as
[47:46] I said we're we are looking for another
[47:48] stir now we understand that this is not
[47:51] a this is not more of his word to open
[47:54] you know brother bear has come Malachi 4
[47:57] has come to reveal the mystery of God
[47:59] it's finished right the word has come
[48:01] but now we know that a Revival a true
[48:03] Revival now if we look at revivals in
[48:05] the past it was always a company with
[48:07] great power of God it was never just an
[48:09] intellectual Revival it wasn't just a
[48:12] putting the quotes and scriptures
[48:13] together just right there was always
[48:15] power behind it I mean even John Wesley
[48:18] when he would he would preach the second
[48:19] work of Grace about sanctification how
[48:22] God how how we should live a holy life
[48:24] you know there was power in his
[48:26] preaching people will be slain in the
[48:28] spirit in the thousands you know he he
[48:30] would he would write I don't know how
[48:32] many miles a year preaching around
[48:33] England on a horse and his horse one day
[48:35] would stumble and break its leg he
[48:37] anointed it with oil prayed for it
[48:38] according to the scripture got up got
[48:40] back on the horse and kept writing and
[48:42] God would do many mighty things and you
[48:44] know it wasn't just with you know in his
[48:45] ministry but down through God you see
[48:47] see God's Doctrine is always accompanied
[48:49] with power as as we speak of the Lord
[48:52] Jesus Luke 4 and 32 he says and they
[48:54] were astonished at his Doctrine for his
[48:56] word was with power see it wasn't just
[48:59] an empty argument that sounded right it
[49:01] wasn't just a reasonable discussion but
[49:03] there was power there was a company with
[49:05] the word and it should be the same thing
[49:07] with you and I that this bride's Revival
[49:10] that we're currently in I mean because
[49:12] the Thunders have uttered your God has
[49:13] opened his word he's awakened his bride
[49:15] Amen to the power and the reality of the
[49:18] blood of Jesus Christ and so now the
[49:20] bride's Revival is not an intellectual
[49:22] Revival of just realizing what the
[49:25] prophet messenger told us and putting
[49:26] quotes together now that is what Bible
[49:29] schools have been doing for Generations
[49:31] they have taken scriptures they've made
[49:33] their stand they've made schools they've
[49:35] made disciples that have just learned
[49:37] what they've been taught but there's
[49:38] been no power in it but we live in a
[49:41] season where it's meant to be a Breaking
[49:42] of that kind of a cycle where it's not
[49:44] just learning the Bible or learning the
[49:46] message those things are good we should
[49:48] study it please don't quit studying just
[49:50] because I'm saying this don't give me
[49:51] wrong we should study it we should
[49:52] memorize it we should comprehend it we
[49:54] should absorb it amen but it's got to be
[49:57] more than just something learned it must
[49:59] be lived where God takes those quotes
[50:01] and those scriptures and anoints them to
[50:03] our lives and makes it live amen because
[50:05] remember it's not just it's not just an
[50:08] argument that we have we don't just have
[50:09] an argument Christianity is not an
[50:11] argument Christianity is a life is a
[50:14] life of the Lord Jesus Christ coming
[50:15] into you and changing your life amen see
[50:18] the problem is these disciples thought
[50:19] they could sail that storm by themselves
[50:22] and that's what Christians especially
[50:23] you know the worst kind of devil is a
[50:25] religious devil because it can reason so
[50:28] much with the truth it can use quotes
[50:30] and scriptures to defend itself amen but
[50:32] I trust we can never defend sin in our
[50:35] lives using quotes and scriptures you
[50:38] know we should never ever be a human
[50:39] shield to the enemy like that amen if
[50:41] there's something wrong in our lives we
[50:43] should just be honest with God because
[50:44] God knows it anyway and say Lord change
[50:47] me I can't change myself and we can't
[50:49] change ourselves anyway we must be
[50:51] surrendered vessels to almighty God that
[50:53] he can moles and shape us into his very
[50:55] image and you're glad where his
[50:57] workmanship he's still working on me
[51:00] well then how do you know when you're
[51:01] going to be completed when this body's
[51:03] changed Hallelujah
[51:05] so until that I'm on the wheel but mold
[51:07] me Lord don't leave me on the Shelf to
[51:10] get dry and crusty and hard and cracking
[51:12] now be wet with your with your spirit
[51:14] anointed amen molded in shape with the
[51:16] Master's Hand Hallelujah that's how I
[51:18] want to be
[51:19] now we just think about it now I just
[51:21] want to pose this question now just
[51:23] think
[51:23] what if the Holy Ghost had everyone here
[51:26] completely in his control just just in
[51:28] these four walls right now what if the
[51:30] Holy Ghost had everybody in here
[51:32] completely in his control just think of
[51:34] what would take place tonight this
[51:35] brother but I'm saying and just once
[51:36] more Lord just think of what would take
[51:38] place in Shreveport or say in Tauranga
[51:40] by this time tomorrow night there would
[51:42] be headlines ever a bunch of people went
[51:44] crazy they were Healing The Sick they
[51:46] were raising the dead they're doing all
[51:47] kinds of things down in Shreveport
[51:49] Louisiana United States USA that have it
[51:51] on television of what was doing if the
[51:54] Holy Ghost could take completely control
[51:56] why don't he he wants to he's willing to
[51:59] he is waiting well you say I've asked
[52:02] them so many times I just hate to ask
[52:04] him too much ask abundantly that your
[52:06] Joys might be full amen I'm so thankful
[52:09] there's not a ceiling we can put on our
[52:11] God Amen he he is the unlimited God he's
[52:14] Unlimited in potential Unlimited in
[52:16] power and but he wants you pardon me to
[52:19] call him on the scene this morning
[52:21] Hallelujah so what would he do in
[52:23] Tauranga right now I mean if he had us
[52:26] all completely under his control amen
[52:28] that we stop whacking each other with
[52:30] our oars stop splashing each other with
[52:32] our arguments and our well I don't agree
[52:34] with you on whatever
[52:35] put down our oars that way and awaken
[52:37] the master this morning amen he could
[52:40] step on the scene and calm the storm
[52:42] that's going on aiming to get us to the
[52:44] other side because he's willing to but
[52:46] he is waiting see Jesus knew the storm
[52:48] would come
[52:50] he wasn't surprised he knew the maniac
[52:52] was there and you know in the tombs he
[52:54] saw it by Vision he says the son can do
[52:56] nothing till the father shows him and
[52:58] what the father does he does likewise
[53:00] that he was led by Vision amen so he was
[53:02] led by Vision so he saw the storm would
[53:04] come he knew what the disciples would
[53:06] even do Hallelujah but I'm so thankful
[53:09] they came to a point where they actually
[53:10] came to their right mind and awakened
[53:12] the master don't you care Lord that
[53:15] we're going to perish Hallelujah he knew
[53:17] they wouldn't perish because he knew
[53:18] that he had to get to Calvary and go to
[53:20] the go down to Hell take the keys off
[53:22] hell death and the graveyard Satan and
[53:23] the Ascend and be trumpet so he knew
[53:25] that his Earthly Journey wasn't going to
[53:27] end in that sea and you're going to
[53:29] realize whatever trial you're in right
[53:30] now that's not the end of your Earthly
[53:32] Journey amen but you've got glory to go
[53:34] to you've got streets of gold to dance
[53:35] upon Hallelujah you've got a wedding
[53:37] supper to attend amen you've got a
[53:39] reservation at the table I trust God has
[53:41] revealed that to you amen so this is not
[53:44] the end of your journey amen but I'm so
[53:47] thankful that trials actually are made
[53:49] that that it will release the power of
[53:51] God to us there are many times we think
[53:52] Charles and hardship are uh uh you could
[53:55] say a curse or no they're actually a
[53:57] blessing where trials are built actually
[53:59] to not just release the power of God to
[54:02] us but to free us of trouble now we look
[54:04] at the you know um Shadrach Meshach and
[54:07] Abednego they were Bounder you know they
[54:09] were bound they're under a great trial
[54:11] there that a lot of pressure was upon
[54:14] them to bow to the golden image that
[54:15] Nebuchadnezzar set up and say that they
[54:18] were bound and they were thrown into the
[54:20] furnace now to me you know I mean I mean
[54:23] the reason we we often think of them is
[54:25] because they didn't get burnt up in the
[54:27] fire but I believe they'd still be
[54:29] perfectly good Believers and good to
[54:30] refer to their testimony if they got
[54:32] burned up and the fire never came out
[54:34] because they said if God's willing to
[54:36] save us praise God if not we're still
[54:37] not going to Bow and to me that is that
[54:39] is truly the heart of a real believer
[54:42] but you see the thing is they were Bound
[54:43] by circumstances but they're now so the
[54:45] so the pressure of the king the fiery
[54:48] furnace all it did was release them from
[54:50] their bands and release the power of God
[54:53] to them because they begin to realize
[54:54] hey God is not just in a prayer meeting
[54:55] because they had prep meetings with
[54:57] Daniel and Daniel got the interpretation
[54:59] to the image that that King
[55:01] Nebuchadnezzar saw so it's not just God
[55:03] in a prayer meeting he's God in great
[55:05] trouble he's God in a furnace Hallelujah
[55:07] and all the fairness did was release
[55:09] them from their bands and they walked
[55:11] out and the smell of smoke wasn't even
[55:12] upon them they didn't need someone to
[55:15] Cut the Ropes off them God released them
[55:17] in the fire amen so in that great trial
[55:19] it just actually released them to walk
[55:21] with God
[55:22] Hallelujah and you're glad trials are
[55:25] built that way
[55:26] hallelujah amen so
[55:28] he's willing amen but he's he God is
[55:32] waiting
[55:34] amen now we understand that you know
[55:36] many people stand in this day and they
[55:38] say well we don't need we don't need the
[55:40] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[55:42] and I I really disagree we need the
[55:44] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need to we
[55:47] need the mechanics of the word and we
[55:48] need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[55:50] we're neither both together amen I was
[55:52] going to call this the Temple of the
[55:53] mechanics and the Dynamics now now the
[55:55] now the disciples had the mechanics and
[55:58] they had the Dynamics but they had to
[55:59] awaken him to manifest the Dynamics
[56:01] because he is the Dynamics right it
[56:04] means that some people think well we
[56:05] don't need the move of God in our
[56:06] churches no more you know we have the
[56:08] full truth and we've gone past the uh
[56:10] Pentecostal age but the thing is you
[56:13] know when God does something in history
[56:14] he doesn't take away when he advances so
[56:18] for example but just shall live by faith
[56:20] is what Luther preached right there was
[56:22] a lot of things Luther did that we don't
[56:23] agree with he sprinkled babies in the
[56:25] titles he was smoking he was drinking
[56:27] you know he's you know you know he was
[56:29] against the Jews and all those kind of
[56:30] things we don't agree with those things
[56:31] right but he preach the just shall live
[56:33] by faith so it's because there's a lot
[56:35] of faults but there was the truth in
[56:37] there but then that truth when Wesley
[56:38] came with sanctification you know he
[56:41] didn't throw away justification he did
[56:42] not throw away the just shall live by
[56:44] faith but God added to amen and then
[56:47] when the Pentecostals came with the
[56:48] restoration of the gifts they didn't
[56:50] take away justification or
[56:51] sanctification God added right to them
[56:55] why do we come now when the full word is
[56:56] being manifested why do people come
[56:58] along and throw away the gifts and the
[57:00] moving of the spirit
[57:02] I mean because but to me I think the
[57:04] reason is is because those gifts are set
[57:06] into the body to call Sin out that's the
[57:09] reason that people don't want the moving
[57:10] of the Holy Ghost no more is because God
[57:12] will use those gifts to call Sin out in
[57:15] the church amen to keep the church clean
[57:16] so we need the gifts I mean we need God
[57:19] to come down and tongues interpretation
[57:21] or prophecy and call out someone because
[57:23] that's actually the mercy and grace of
[57:24] God to that person amen because you know
[57:27] it's like David King David thought that
[57:29] he got away with it with Bathsheba we're
[57:31] told that two years after that all
[57:33] happened Uriah was dead they were
[57:34] married different things that that
[57:36] Nathan the prophet came into the throne
[57:37] room and began to power you know you
[57:40] gave the parable of the two you know one
[57:42] rich man and one poor man one had many
[57:43] sheep one had none and all those things
[57:45] and David you know called out his own
[57:46] judgment saying that man should die that
[57:48] stole the sheep from the poor man and
[57:49] you know Nathan said you're that man
[57:51] what was that it was a gift in the body
[57:53] giving Mercy to David
[57:56] I mean so so we need the moving of the
[57:58] spirit amen we need the gift see God
[58:00] hasn't taken them away they're still in
[58:01] the body amen we need the Dynamics of
[58:04] the Holy Ghost
[58:05] but then we need we need the so so
[58:08] brother Brian CC says now he says I'm
[58:10] just letting off the steam I said now I
[58:13] don't think that we have to
[58:14] um
[58:15] um I don't think that had to be
[58:16] necessary but I think
[58:18] um they've got to have a vent somewhere
[58:19] to speak about Pentacles see I'd rather
[58:21] have someone to shout and let the steam
[58:23] off at least they got steam to let off
[58:24] Hallelujah like you see a steam trainer
[58:27] can be just standing there but all the
[58:28] steam comes out of it well you know
[58:29] there's fire in the engine fuel's being
[58:31] put in amen there's a fire in the engine
[58:33] at least they've got the engines can run
[58:35] it's not cold and just sitting there on
[58:37] the train tracks right and at someone
[58:39] who begins to shout and rejoice hey let
[58:41] the steam off praise the Lord at least
[58:43] that person's got steam to let off
[58:45] Hallelujah amens he says no he says now
[58:49] if they would just take all that Steam
[58:50] and could know how to direct it
[58:52] fundamentally in the word the big regime
[58:53] of God would start moving on
[58:55] Hallelujah that's where Satan got in and
[58:58] made it all mechanics and no Dynamics
[59:00] back where all the uh back all Dynamics
[59:03] and no mechanics see there we've got to
[59:05] put it together we've got we've got the
[59:07] power of the Holy Spirit but we've got
[59:09] to come back with the word to feed this
[59:11] machine
[59:13] amen we can't feed it on a Creed it
[59:16] won't burn it chokes up the flus it it
[59:18] will not burn it it was made for the
[59:20] word of God man should not live by bread
[59:21] alone but by every word not just part of
[59:24] it every word that proceeds out of the
[59:26] mouth of God I'll say it won't it won't
[59:28] be fed on opinion
[59:31] and and and it won't be fed on just
[59:33] defending a lifestyle that thing will
[59:36] never feed the engine of God it's got to
[59:38] be genuine a grade coal genuine a grade
[59:41] word amen without malice or Strife just
[59:43] a pure heart amen that will get this
[59:45] great regime of God going amen we've got
[59:47] to feed this machine on the word of God
[59:50] now brother bear it's amazing how much
[59:52] he emphasizes the Dynamics remember he's
[59:54] in the ship the Dynamics itself is in
[59:57] the ship amen see he says he says see
[59:59] now what if someone would have said Noah
[1:00:01] I want you to explain the mechanics of
[1:00:03] the Ark floating he couldn't do that he
[1:00:06] didn't know how the mechanics he just
[1:00:07] the Dynamics of us see it's the
[1:00:09] mechanics is what we want to know
[1:00:11] and he says the Dynamics of this church
[1:00:13] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[1:00:15] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:00:18] while The Headstone is coming down to
[1:00:19] unite with the body but when that hidden
[1:00:21] body unites together the full power of
[1:00:23] the Holy Spirit Will Will would raise
[1:00:25] her up just exactly like that even the
[1:00:27] dead the dead in Christ for 400 for
[1:00:29] hundreds of years ago will rise up in
[1:00:31] the beauty of his Holiness and take a
[1:00:33] flight to the skies the Dynamics is the
[1:00:35] Holy Spirit
[1:00:37] Hallelujah he says that we want Dynamics
[1:00:39] I don't care about the mechanics no no
[1:00:41] we don't want to throw away the
[1:00:42] mechanics we but we have the mechanics
[1:00:45] amen we have the mechanics we have the
[1:00:47] word right we have the mechanic so we
[1:00:49] don't need more mechanics we have it
[1:00:52] right and we can study the mechanics to
[1:00:54] see exactly the detail of the mechanics
[1:00:56] yeah right but we need the Dynamics and
[1:00:58] the mechanics to come together see we've
[1:01:00] got to have the Lord come on the scene
[1:01:02] to be awakened to make it work
[1:01:05] who's with me this morning who wants to
[1:01:07] see more of God in our lives amen see
[1:01:09] this is not just well there's a lot of
[1:01:11] Home Focus I'm preaching like I'm at
[1:01:12] home amen but praise the Lord yeah but
[1:01:15] you see it's see we've got to have the
[1:01:17] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost but you see
[1:01:18] now the disciples when they were on the
[1:01:20] ship they had forgotten that the
[1:01:22] Dynamics himself was asleep
[1:01:25] but then they needed to wake him I mean
[1:01:29] they needed to put down their oars of
[1:01:30] opinion they needed to put down their
[1:01:32] complexes and the hurts and their pain
[1:01:34] and refocus on the one who was with them
[1:01:36] see our God is so real he's so alive
[1:01:39] amen he's more than a nice idea but he's
[1:01:42] a true and living God
[1:01:44] amen you see brother Brown would ask the
[1:01:46] question and the world again falling
[1:01:48] apart now as I said we've had a Revival
[1:01:50] even personally we've all had revivals I
[1:01:52] want to you know a time of Awakening
[1:01:54] where God moved in great power but then
[1:01:57] where are we now in our Christian walk
[1:01:59] right where are we now you we said well
[1:02:02] I just started a couple of weeks ago God
[1:02:04] bless you but keep keep the freshness
[1:02:06] and the love and the Zeal for God in
[1:02:08] your heart I mean always don't lose your
[1:02:10] first love love for more every day
[1:02:12] appreciate it more every day I think it
[1:02:14] was Brother Martin who said to me after
[1:02:15] the um waiting you know um um you say he
[1:02:19] said man this is such a blessing to have
[1:02:20] a Christian wedding in this day it's a
[1:02:23] rare thing yes yes and and I think it
[1:02:25] should be celebrated well we did
[1:02:27] celebrate but we should appreciate it
[1:02:28] all right two two young people coming
[1:02:30] together
[1:02:31] as real Christians are getting married
[1:02:33] that's an awesome thing we should never
[1:02:35] take it for granted but the thing is we
[1:02:36] get acclimatized to where we live right
[1:02:39] we get used to having the Lord with us
[1:02:41] you know we like like the disciples well
[1:02:43] he's just asleep in the ship he's right
[1:02:45] here with us we know who he he's there
[1:02:47] you know we should never take for
[1:02:50] granted him in our lives
[1:02:53] amen because once upon a time I was dead
[1:02:56] and trespassing since I was living in
[1:02:58] absolute Darkness but he found me I
[1:03:01] wasn't looking for him he was looking
[1:03:02] for me and he found me and now I live in
[1:03:03] a different atmosphere Hallelujah and
[1:03:06] you know it can be it can be quite
[1:03:07] shocking really when you when your eyes
[1:03:08] come open you're spiritualizing you see
[1:03:10] you know what's shocking to see that you
[1:03:12] need him you're a wretched sinner you
[1:03:14] need to be washed you need to be
[1:03:15] cleansed but then you come through the
[1:03:17] other side and you begin to think man I
[1:03:18] used to live that you know because you
[1:03:20] can't identify who you are now to who
[1:03:22] you were then hallelujah I'm so glad God
[1:03:24] does such a work in our lives amen but
[1:03:27] you know but then we get used to being a
[1:03:29] believer it becomes comfortable but we
[1:03:32] should never take him for granted I mean
[1:03:34] we should always appreciate his goodness
[1:03:36] and his Mercy
[1:03:37] Hallelujah but you see now a brother bam
[1:03:40] would ask a question he'd say about this
[1:03:41] being being between revivals
[1:03:44] he'd say now I don't care how much that
[1:03:46] car runs out there it's got pistons and
[1:03:48] cylinders I don't know how much pressure
[1:03:50] is used the other thing I know is the
[1:03:52] Dynamics put her out there and and drive
[1:03:54] it that's and that's what we know God
[1:03:57] made the promise I'll pull my spirit out
[1:03:58] upon All Flesh your sons and daughters
[1:04:00] shall prophesy how's he going to do it I
[1:04:03] can't tell you I just want to know the
[1:04:04] Dynamics of God's system that's the main
[1:04:06] thing today we've studied the mechanics
[1:04:08] until it's all mechanical what's good is
[1:04:10] an automobile without knowing um without
[1:04:13] something in it to drive it what's good
[1:04:15] is the lights or the fixtures if there's
[1:04:17] no current to go in it see we've we've
[1:04:20] got all the mechanics we've got the
[1:04:21] schools the Educators and so forth that
[1:04:23] can train a man till he can stand the
[1:04:25] pulpit with such manners till he's an
[1:04:27] eloquent person that still don't bring
[1:04:29] the power of God where is the power of
[1:04:31] God that used to be in the church where
[1:04:33] is that Pentecostal blessing that used
[1:04:36] to flow through the churches that's the
[1:04:37] reason our world is falling apart
[1:04:39] because we've got away from the real
[1:04:41] principles of God and educated men into
[1:04:43] systems and things and that's what it's
[1:04:45] got to take that's what's got us in this
[1:04:47] condition we are today I believe that's
[1:04:49] the reason our world is falling apart
[1:04:51] why because they got away from the
[1:04:53] Pentecostal blessing the Pentecostal
[1:04:55] blessings are just Amplified in the
[1:04:56] message that's right we have the full
[1:04:59] power of God we have all that he is I
[1:05:01] mean we can't just look back and say
[1:05:02] well those people had that what do we
[1:05:03] have we have that yeah I mean but you
[1:05:06] gotta awaken him from to come upon the
[1:05:09] scene hey man see my house desire is
[1:05:12] this puts on flesh yes and and you and I
[1:05:16] I mean that it's not just that we're not
[1:05:17] just a bunch of religious people that
[1:05:19] can quote right and look the part but
[1:05:22] God comes and lives in our lives and
[1:05:24] manifests what he said that's why he
[1:05:25] died on Calvary amen that every promise
[1:05:27] of God will be manifested in our lives
[1:05:29] amen because remember all that he is I
[1:05:32] want
[1:05:33] Hallelujah I want forgiveness of sins
[1:05:35] that's in him praise the Lord I want his
[1:05:37] transforming power to change my life
[1:05:39] that's in him I want it praise the Lord
[1:05:40] I want to be a new creature in him amen
[1:05:43] that's in him right but then in them is
[1:05:45] tongues and prophecy and all knowledge
[1:05:47] and gifts and discernment and healing
[1:05:49] all the nine spiritual gifts are still
[1:05:51] in the message because Jesus Christ is
[1:05:53] the message right you know you're forgot
[1:05:55] to come down and change our lives that's
[1:05:57] that's in the message right Hallelujah
[1:06:00] who's with me are you all okay today see
[1:06:03] see he's in the ship amen he's in the
[1:06:06] ship we just got to wake him up I want a
[1:06:08] Revival I want to Revival myself I want
[1:06:10] more of God you know I don't you know
[1:06:12] remember this this mountain or this Walk
[1:06:15] we're having with God is not a plateau
[1:06:17] right it's not like I was saying in
[1:06:18] South Africa who's saying Table Mountain
[1:06:20] you know it's like steeping this like
[1:06:22] flat on top it's a table right I walk
[1:06:24] with God is not like climbing Table
[1:06:26] Mountain you get up certain height
[1:06:27] there's just a plateau and you just keep
[1:06:29] going on until the Rapture and here we
[1:06:30] are no we're climbing a Mount Zion yeah
[1:06:33] right it's always onwards and upwards in
[1:06:35] our Christmas sure we may have dips in
[1:06:36] trouble but but as long as we're
[1:06:38] trending upwards
[1:06:39] Hallelujah that's the main thing why
[1:06:41] because there's more of God to have and
[1:06:43] he wants to give you more of himself
[1:06:45] amen they see all that he is is
[1:06:48] available to you and I he see he loves
[1:06:51] us so much he doesn't just give a part
[1:06:52] of himself he doesn't just give maybe a
[1:06:54] good church service and a bit of healing
[1:06:56] here and there no all that he is amen
[1:06:58] and and he actually calls us his friends
[1:07:01] amen that that he will actually show us
[1:07:03] the things that are to come
[1:07:05] Hallelujah he forewarns us before it
[1:07:07] comes on the scene he's made a way of
[1:07:09] Escape that we don't have to go into the
[1:07:11] Great Tribulation amen but all his power
[1:07:13] is not for the tribulation or not for
[1:07:15] the Millennium it's now healing right
[1:07:17] what is what will be the body change
[1:07:19] it'll be the greatest Divine Healing
[1:07:21] sweep that's ever struck the world where
[1:07:23] these bodies these add-ons will be
[1:07:24] changed from Mortal bodies to Immortal
[1:07:26] bodies Hallelujah
[1:07:28] Hallelujah but all these things are here
[1:07:30] yeah I'm not telling you anything new
[1:07:32] this is not something we're looking for
[1:07:34] it's here
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:38] Hallelujah because brotherbraham said
[1:07:39] it'll take those seven Thunders to
[1:07:40] awaken the bride he says and he says
[1:07:42] that the revelation of Seven Seals is
[1:07:43] the seven Thunders so it's here right
[1:07:45] we're not looking for it to come it's
[1:07:47] here right now but you've got to wake
[1:07:48] him up
[1:07:49] he's in your ship he's having a good
[1:07:51] sleep you're journeying on the right way
[1:07:53] but you got to wake him up
[1:07:55] amen that's he says here see
[1:07:58] see so we used to be this power this
[1:08:01] Pentecostal blessings that used to flow
[1:08:02] through the churches where is it gone
[1:08:05] he's asleep
[1:08:07] we need to wake him up
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:11] now
[1:08:13] the devil does not want us to have
[1:08:15] Revival no he wants us to be called
[1:08:18] lukewarm formal and Powerless that's
[1:08:21] what he wants us to be he wants us just
[1:08:23] to go through the motions not get
[1:08:25] anything more from God not be changed
[1:08:27] just just Plateau walk you know and lose
[1:08:30] our vision put our eyes out that's what
[1:08:32] what the world he wants to gouge our
[1:08:33] eyes out we don't see the promises of
[1:08:35] God just like Samson you know it's
[1:08:36] amazing Samson you know he didn't heed
[1:08:38] the warnings you think Delilah's trying
[1:08:40] to find out the source of my strength
[1:08:42] you think he would have woken up maybe
[1:08:43] after at least the second time
[1:08:46] but he was loud to sleep by the world
[1:08:48] until the world gouges his eyes out you
[1:08:51] know but the thing is see see but his
[1:08:53] the power of God was upon him to give
[1:08:56] total Victory to Israel and the power of
[1:08:58] God is upon us
[1:09:00] Amen to bring in whosoever will the
[1:09:03] dynamic power of God to flow through our
[1:09:05] lives once again amen for God to move in
[1:09:08] power that people come to the Lord where
[1:09:10] there's such an atmosphere around us
[1:09:12] that that people want what we have
[1:09:14] Hallelujah
[1:09:16] so finally the disciples got to a place
[1:09:20] they had been arguing maybe for hours as
[1:09:22] they were rowing I went from a testimony
[1:09:24] winning two to to arguing about The
[1:09:26] Parables that Jesus had had spoken and
[1:09:30] maybe they'd already split into camps
[1:09:32] about the different Parables that they
[1:09:34] had heard because of your different
[1:09:35] understandings but then as the wind
[1:09:37] began to blow and the storms begin to
[1:09:39] rage they begin to think well we can
[1:09:42] still have our fusses and arguments you
[1:09:44] know and and still handle the ship
[1:09:46] because they were raised on the sea but
[1:09:48] they came to a point where they realized
[1:09:50] all of their faith fussing and fighting
[1:09:52] and arguments has achieved nothing
[1:09:55] and they need to lay aside their oars
[1:09:57] their arguments their their their
[1:09:59] misunderstandings and call Jesus on the
[1:10:02] scene
[1:10:03] Hallelujah and that's exactly what we
[1:10:05] need to do this morning
[1:10:07] amen is call awaken him he's he's asleep
[1:10:10] because we how many times especially us
[1:10:13] men we try and work out our problems
[1:10:15] we're built to fix things we can fix it
[1:10:18] we can just do you know just just change
[1:10:19] our behaviors and make things a bit
[1:10:21] better and you know but but in our
[1:10:23] Humanity in our strength we try and fix
[1:10:25] our problems like the disciples and
[1:10:27] their strength and they're what they
[1:10:28] knew they could fix the you know they
[1:10:30] just adjust the sales change how they
[1:10:31] wrote adjust things in the boat and
[1:10:33] they'll get through the storm but they
[1:10:35] came to a point where they realized that
[1:10:37] that that in their human ability and all
[1:10:40] that they knew they could not save
[1:10:42] themselves
[1:10:44] and it's when we get to that point
[1:10:46] instead of just going around the Myriad
[1:10:49] go around and saying I'm going to do
[1:10:50] better this time and I'm going to quit
[1:10:51] drinking and I'm going to quit the drugs
[1:10:52] and I'm going to stop doing this and you
[1:10:54] know I'm going to turn a new Leaf you
[1:10:56] know when we get to a point where we
[1:10:57] realize we cannot do it we cannot
[1:11:00] improve ourselves we cannot free
[1:11:01] ourselves that's when we can call Jesus
[1:11:04] on the scene I'm
[1:11:10] got across the ship I mean got across
[1:11:12] the sea without ever Awakening him in
[1:11:15] their own strength but this God allowed
[1:11:17] the storm to be in such a way because
[1:11:18] remember brother Brown would say that
[1:11:20] you know because Jesus was so tired from
[1:11:22] the meetings and healing people and
[1:11:23] everything that you know he was so wore
[1:11:25] out and then then and then brother Brown
[1:11:27] said ten thousand Demons of Hell got
[1:11:29] into those waves and they swore that
[1:11:31] they would drown him
[1:11:32] it means I saw the same thing there's
[1:11:34] storms that come in our lives and the
[1:11:36] devil said I'm going to destroy them in
[1:11:37] that storm but in those storms is when
[1:11:40] God can step on the scene if you awaken
[1:11:42] him if you call him on the scene amen so
[1:11:45] they had to they had to now they had to
[1:11:48] drop their oars and they had to awaken
[1:11:51] the master
[1:11:53] Hallelujah I'm just trying to find a
[1:11:54] book bit too um because I just want to
[1:11:57] get this point to us because this is up
[1:11:58] to us right so they had to wake him up
[1:12:00] saying Master do you not care that we
[1:12:02] perish you know it's amazing how how
[1:12:05] they would they would think that God did
[1:12:07] not care of the storm in their room
[1:12:08] though he was in the ship with them see
[1:12:10] his remember God's hands are tied unless
[1:12:13] we call them on the scene he is the high
[1:12:15] priest of our profession right and he
[1:12:18] will not work on your behalf unless you
[1:12:20] call upon his name unless you take his
[1:12:22] promises and lift them before him he
[1:12:25] cannot help you unless you do that see
[1:12:26] many times people expect well God's got
[1:12:28] to just do a work and he's got to change
[1:12:29] me and all these things but you've got
[1:12:31] to invite him to do it you've got to be
[1:12:33] willing for him to become the master of
[1:12:35] your ship see they call them on the
[1:12:37] scene not that he would lend an ore and
[1:12:39] just join in their arguments and fusses
[1:12:41] but he called they called him on the
[1:12:43] scene and he would take over he'd become
[1:12:44] the captain of that ship and that's what
[1:12:46] we must do is we must be willing to let
[1:12:49] him take over our lives not just fix our
[1:12:51] problems but take over our lives I mean
[1:12:53] and that's what he did he called they
[1:12:55] called him on the scene they woke him
[1:12:57] out of that sleep that he could step on
[1:12:59] the scene and and calm the storm
[1:13:03] Hallelujah
[1:13:05] amen so they got to that point don't you
[1:13:07] care that we perish and sometimes we get
[1:13:09] that attitude doesn't God care that I'm
[1:13:11] in this state
[1:13:12] he cares
[1:13:13] he cares whatever if we're on a mountain
[1:13:15] in a valley he cares where we are if
[1:13:18] we're lost in darkness or a walk in the
[1:13:20] light he cares where you are he cares
[1:13:21] about our family he cares about our
[1:13:23] situations but they said don't you care
[1:13:25] that we Pierce Lord are you not
[1:13:27] interested in the fact we're going to
[1:13:28] drown in the storm and they woke him up
[1:13:30] thinking he did not care but he cared
[1:13:32] but he was waiting for them to call him
[1:13:35] on the scene and it's got to be the same
[1:13:37] thing with you and I friends we've got
[1:13:39] to get to a place if we want Revival in
[1:13:41] our lives we're going to waken up the
[1:13:43] Lord in our boat remember he's in your
[1:13:45] ship I trust he's in your ship if not
[1:13:48] invite him into your ship but if he's in
[1:13:49] your ship he can say master I need you
[1:13:52] yes I need you to come on the scene Lord
[1:13:54] I need you that your name will be
[1:13:56] glorified in my life I can't live this
[1:13:58] message in my strength I can't be a
[1:14:00] Christian in my own ability all I've
[1:14:02] done is hit people with oars and quotes
[1:14:04] and ideas and cause fusses and troubles
[1:14:06] but Lord I need you to come on the scene
[1:14:08] forgive me Lord that we ever were
[1:14:09] fighting and having trouble and building
[1:14:11] camps and all this trouble Lord we need
[1:14:13] you to change this reason we need you to
[1:14:15] break the cycle that that Unity will
[1:14:17] come among the body that will be love
[1:14:19] one for another there's no big eyes and
[1:14:21] little ears but we're all on the same
[1:14:22] team I mean they're all the same in the
[1:14:24] Lord so they began to wake him up and
[1:14:26] immediately he got up and he just spoke
[1:14:28] he said peace be still Yes Hallelujah
[1:14:31] and then then the wind and waves ceased
[1:14:33] and there was a great calm and then they
[1:14:36] were even more afraid
[1:14:37] of the one in their ship because they
[1:14:39] didn't realize the power that was within
[1:14:41] him until they called him on the scene
[1:14:43] and I woke him up
[1:14:45] now how about us friends today this may
[1:14:48] be a bit short but I'm just gonna this
[1:14:50] is just what I want to place on your
[1:14:51] hearts
[1:14:52] wake him up
[1:14:54] wake him up wake up the master he
[1:14:57] honestly the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:58] flow through our lives again wake up the
[1:15:00] master he's there all All That Heaven is
[1:15:03] is actually here I meant all the say
[1:15:05] we're going to meet him physically in
[1:15:06] the air right but all Jesus Christ is
[1:15:08] apart from his Corporal body is here
[1:15:09] right now the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:12] is here all the blessings of God are
[1:15:14] here all the promises are here there's
[1:15:16] no we're not waiting for a time for them
[1:15:18] to be unlocked all the problems have
[1:15:19] been unlocked to the believer if it's
[1:15:21] healing if it's Deliverance if it's for
[1:15:23] prodigals to come home whatever it might
[1:15:25] be you say Lord how gonna how can I come
[1:15:28] back he'll make a way he always makes a
[1:15:31] way for a willing heart amen that's a
[1:15:33] big thing it's not about the state we're
[1:15:34] in they are in a terrible state but they
[1:15:36] call them on the scene you know the
[1:15:38] woman of the well was in a terrible
[1:15:39] state but but she she realized that he
[1:15:42] was Messiah and she got what she needed
[1:15:44] amen the woman with the blood issue it's
[1:15:46] amazing how the chosen brought it out
[1:15:48] how she wasn't allowed because of the
[1:15:50] blood issue she was actually unclean
[1:15:51] wasn't allowed among the Israelites
[1:15:53] right but but she pressed past all the
[1:15:55] rejection all the things she would faced
[1:15:57] because she had to get to the master and
[1:15:59] it's the same thing with you and I he's
[1:16:01] here we can Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:16:03] by faith amen can meet our needs even
[1:16:05] now amen there's no case too helpless
[1:16:08] there's no one too hopeless amen if
[1:16:10] there's life in their bodies God can do
[1:16:12] anything he can turn the heart he can he
[1:16:15] can take the hardest heart amen and make
[1:16:17] it a heart of Flesh amen he can
[1:16:19] transform anyone I believe it he he
[1:16:20] saved me I believe he can do it for
[1:16:22] anyone Hallelujah so we can call him
[1:16:25] on the scene we can call the Lord Jesus
[1:16:28] on the scene amen so how about you and
[1:16:31] your situation see pride will keep him
[1:16:33] asleep amen but if we lasside our pride
[1:16:36] in what people will think maybe maybe
[1:16:38] Peter because he was the Burly fisherman
[1:16:39] maybe you know he had to come to a point
[1:16:41] where he realized his pride was actually
[1:16:43] going to get them sunk you know there's
[1:16:45] water filling up in the boat they
[1:16:46] couldn't bail it out fast enough he
[1:16:48] could do all the things he tried he had
[1:16:50] to lay aside his pride of who he thought
[1:16:52] he was and he had to call the Lord Jesus
[1:16:54] on the scene how about you and I people
[1:16:56] are afraid what will people think of me
[1:16:58] well actually the Believers will
[1:16:59] actually think more of you amen say
[1:17:01] praise God Amen someone was genuine with
[1:17:04] the Lord and then
[1:17:05] and they came to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:07] so we should never look down on anyone
[1:17:10] amen you know you know um
[1:17:13] amen we should never look down at anyone
[1:17:14] but we should we should love everybody
[1:17:16] that's it Amen Brother Bear makes a
[1:17:19] statement he says now he says
[1:17:21] um so so this is in the Lamb of the dove
[1:17:23] and this is actually the um Jubilee
[1:17:26] um 50th year from the Azusa Street
[1:17:28] Revival he he says now brother Brown
[1:17:30] what's the way back to the old-fashioned
[1:17:32] meetings
[1:17:33] they said just become Lambs again
[1:17:36] let's all just get back to being sheep
[1:17:38] the dove hasn't gone very far he's just
[1:17:41] waiting a chance to get back there's the
[1:17:43] road back to Azusa Street that's there's
[1:17:45] the place back back to the Azusa Street
[1:17:47] meetings again is a return to a lamb
[1:17:51] nature again now some people think well
[1:17:53] we're not going back to Azusa Street
[1:17:54] maybe we're not but what happened to
[1:17:57] Azusa Street the Holy Ghost came down
[1:17:58] and took over everyone was under his
[1:18:02] control and he did what he wanted to do
[1:18:04] in the meetings now how much more now
[1:18:05] the Bride of Jesus Christ we want to
[1:18:07] have those old-fashioned meetings again
[1:18:09] where it's not political maneuvering in
[1:18:11] man and human humans you're elevating
[1:18:13] themselves and you know just religious
[1:18:15] spirits but it's actually God comes down
[1:18:17] and takes over the whole service
[1:18:19] Hallelujah do we want those
[1:18:21] old-fashioned meat I do I want God to
[1:18:23] come down and just change every life and
[1:18:25] change my life and if he wants to anoint
[1:18:27] someone to speak or whatever more made
[1:18:29] happen to you you know he anoints the
[1:18:31] musicians the noise the song leader a
[1:18:33] nicer congregation to worship amen that
[1:18:35] when we walk out these doors with change
[1:18:37] we get Washed by the Water of the word
[1:18:39] amen if we feel need to pray for someone
[1:18:41] God leads us and we pray for that person
[1:18:42] they get delivered amen whatever it may
[1:18:45] be I want those kind of meetings myself
[1:18:48] well how do we get back to it see they
[1:18:51] had to become Lambs again and the
[1:18:53] disciples had to become Lambs again to
[1:18:55] awaken Jesus amen because they because
[1:18:58] you know when they disagreeing what
[1:18:59] happens that old carnal nature comes
[1:19:01] back and it can be so hidden behind
[1:19:03] message terminology and quotes and
[1:19:06] scriptures all those things but it's
[1:19:07] what a wolf nature comes and he's asleep
[1:19:10] but if you become a lamb again Lord I'm
[1:19:13] sorry for holding that ought against
[1:19:14] that person I'm so sorry for having that
[1:19:16] prejudice and that indifference towards
[1:19:18] that person Lord make me a lamb again
[1:19:19] Lord I want to feel your presence come
[1:19:21] upon me again oh God hallelujah what
[1:19:23] happens in that his great Holy Spirit
[1:19:25] Dove as a dove comes upon you you feel
[1:19:27] that sweetness that love for everybody
[1:19:31] and now we're in condition amen for an
[1:19:34] old-fashioned meeting once again
[1:19:37] and he first met
[1:19:39] the look the grass is greener the sky is
[1:19:42] Bluer everyone is more wonderful doesn't
[1:19:45] matter how terrible someone is you just
[1:19:47] love you just can't I just you just
[1:19:48] can't help but love them why what's
[1:19:50] happening why because the lamb because
[1:19:51] your Nature's been changed to a lamb and
[1:19:53] now the great Heavenly Dove the Holy
[1:19:55] Ghost is biting upon you and everything
[1:19:57] is awesome
[1:19:58] and God moves he just he just you know
[1:20:00] you're not worried about what everyone
[1:20:02] else is doing you're just having a
[1:20:03] Revival with God yourself you know like
[1:20:05] the Welsh policeman saying I am the
[1:20:07] Welsh Revival and everything's amazing
[1:20:09] his word is Rich and pure and it's great
[1:20:11] and you know who wants to come back to
[1:20:14] that yeah and I I I I placed myself on
[1:20:18] that tooth Lord I don't want any malice
[1:20:20] I don't want any Stripes see the devil
[1:20:22] wants us to have malice and indifference
[1:20:23] and unforgiveness towards people they
[1:20:26] can be on the other side of the world
[1:20:27] but you still think bad about them see
[1:20:29] we're going to get those things out
[1:20:30] we've got to say Lord take that out of
[1:20:32] me I want that lamb nature I want to
[1:20:33] feel the sweetness of your presence once
[1:20:35] again amen where you lead me in the
[1:20:38] scripture and you would become so alive
[1:20:39] and then yeah the message is more than
[1:20:41] just going through the motions of
[1:20:42] listening to the tapes with such a joy
[1:20:44] and God speaks you in such a personal
[1:20:46] way
[1:20:48] amen I want an old-fashioned meeting
[1:20:51] and not just on a Sunday morning or a
[1:20:53] Wednesday whatever our midweeks are
[1:20:54] about but every day we're living in an
[1:20:56] old-fashioned meeting I mean because
[1:20:58] what makes an old-fashioned meeting the
[1:21:00] people that come to the old-fashioned
[1:21:01] meeting because they're in an
[1:21:02] old-fashioned condition everything's
[1:21:03] amazing God's God's awesome filled my
[1:21:06] way every day with love Lord
[1:21:07] I mean you're just drunk on the love of
[1:21:09] God Amen his word has become so rich in
[1:21:12] this amen
[1:21:13] Hallelujah now
[1:21:16] John must have stood up brother Brahm
[1:21:18] says because he was he was one of the
[1:21:19] youngest disciples
[1:21:22] must have been young John get up his
[1:21:25] heart his heart wasn't so much so
[1:21:27] scarred with so much theology
[1:21:29] different Winds of Doctrine and troubles
[1:21:31] the younger generation got up Hallelujah
[1:21:36] his heart wasn't so much scarred with so
[1:21:37] much theology he must have said
[1:21:39] something like this think of it right
[1:21:41] here in this ship this one that that is
[1:21:44] identified by Jehovah's word to be
[1:21:46] Jehovah's servant
[1:21:48] in whom he is pleased is right here on
[1:21:51] the ship with us what a secured feeling
[1:21:54] amen when his heart wasn't so scarred up
[1:21:56] with fusses of the past this younger
[1:21:59] generation got up and said just think
[1:22:01] Jehovah God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] himself the one who went to Calvary for
[1:22:06] you and I the one who arose triumphant
[1:22:09] the one who sent back his holy spirit on
[1:22:11] the day of Pentecost the one that was in
[1:22:12] the prophet's life in the previous
[1:22:14] generation's life that same one it's
[1:22:16] with us in the ship today just think
[1:22:18] about that very Lord of Glory
[1:22:20] that even the angels look filthy in a
[1:22:23] society so pure and holy Amy became a
[1:22:26] man to take our sins upon himself Amen
[1:22:28] to wash Us in his blood amen that he
[1:22:31] became sin for us it would become the
[1:22:32] very righteous of God in Christ amen
[1:22:34] that when he looks us he doesn't see our
[1:22:36] Humanity or our failings he see his
[1:22:37] blood he sees his own blood how many
[1:22:39] hears he hears our Voice through his
[1:22:41] blood amen and because he has done that
[1:22:44] for us we are as righteous and as pure
[1:22:46] as he is I mean just think about that
[1:22:48] one before there was a sun moon or star
[1:22:51] and he thought of you and I now he's
[1:22:52] here in the ship with us hallelujah just
[1:22:55] think about that one that the prophets
[1:22:56] met down Through the Ages is not a god
[1:22:59] of History anymore he's not just a
[1:23:01] promise anymore he's a living reality
[1:23:03] right now
[1:23:05] Hallelujah I believe that would have
[1:23:07] changed the whole scene right there when
[1:23:09] they begin to think the very God of
[1:23:10] creation was in the ship with them now
[1:23:12] think about the one that walks of I
[1:23:13] Fearless presence here now I feel his
[1:23:15] presence in this in this meeting here
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:19] the very God of creation is here in the
[1:23:21] ship with us the very one amen that died
[1:23:23] on Calvary field is here with you right
[1:23:25] now amen but if you'll just wake him up
[1:23:27] if you'll just lay aside pride and
[1:23:30] trouble what people will think and say
[1:23:31] Lord I need more of you Lord Jesus wake
[1:23:34] up oh perish Lord
[1:23:36] Hallelujah
[1:23:37] he says we've got to disturb him there's
[1:23:40] an Awakening Jesus 1963 we've got to
[1:23:42] disturb him till you can see him come in
[1:23:45] can't our prayers disturb him can't our
[1:23:48] prayers awaken him from his rest till he
[1:23:51] to to bring him on the scene they did
[1:23:53] they cried out Lord we're perishing and
[1:23:55] he moved on the scene now we can do the
[1:23:58] same thing
[1:23:59] now do you believe that see it's not
[1:24:02] just the noise of our voices it's our
[1:24:05] faith when our faith contacts with him
[1:24:07] it awake so so you can be praying as
[1:24:09] quiet as you want or as loud as you want
[1:24:10] it's the faith in that prayer that God
[1:24:12] hears and he's waiting this morning to
[1:24:15] be called on the scene
