[7:31] [Music]
[7:36] okay praise the lord
[7:41] [Music]
[7:43] you know just a thought
[7:46] today you know that we're gathered here
[7:48] we were eagles
[7:50] yeah we know who we are it doesn't
[7:52] matter what's happening out in the world
[7:56] we know that there's a destination and
[7:58] that eagles are predestinated to be in
[8:00] that destination
[8:03] and that's what is so good about it you
[8:06] know this gathering here is not just
[8:08] because we're gathering we're gathering
[8:09] because there's a destination
[8:12] there's a place that we're going to
[8:14] there's a home
[8:16] that's gone to be prepared for us
[8:20] which means we don't have to even go and
[8:22] build the house
[8:24] hey ben whether this tiny house or a big
[8:28] mansion
[8:29] it's what you desire that god says
[8:32] you'll meet all those desires
[8:35] my you know that destination is like
[8:42] you're going on a plane trip somewhere
[8:45] somewhere maybe down to south africa
[8:48] and you know that that's your
[8:49] destination
[8:52] and so you've got to put things into
[8:54] order
[8:55] you got to go and get your flight
[8:56] tickets you've got to make sure your
[8:58] seats your
[8:59] your passport and everything has to be
[9:02] put in order
[9:04] amen but you know that when you get on
[9:08] that plane
[9:10] as you sit down like you're sitting now
[9:12] on this flight ready to go
[9:15] you do a checklist have you got this
[9:17] have you got that
[9:18] are the kids tucked in the seatbelts on
[9:22] these are things that you have to look
[9:23] at because they say order
[9:25] and god is a god of order amen
[9:30] and then just as you're ready to take
[9:32] off the captain comes over
[9:34] the intercom says ladies and gentlemen
[9:37] there's been a delay
[9:38] [Music]
[9:40] my
[9:43] and that's where satan tries to buffet
[9:45] us that's where we feel
[9:47] that sometimes it's put there for a
[9:50] purpose
[9:51] and this delay that you the captain's
[9:54] telling you
[9:55] is just the environmental atmosphere
[9:59] and the same for us it's just the
[10:01] environmental atmosphere that we're
[10:02] standing in
[10:04] and then he tells you that it's going to
[10:06] be a delay of an hour and a half but
[10:08] we're about to take off anyway
[10:10] but now the route has been changed
[10:13] amen but the destination is still the
[10:16] same
[10:17] hallelujah so wherever we go
[10:21] in our walk in our life don't worry
[10:24] you're going to get there
[10:26] the destination has been chosen and
[10:28] predestinated for you
[10:30] amen and that's our purpose tonight
[10:33] our prayers are going to reach that
[10:36] destination
[10:38] our prayers are going to go around
[10:40] instead of going over or through
[10:42] they're going to go around the obstacles
[10:45] and as we heard about these little foxes
[10:48] they're just little obstacles praise a
[10:50] lot
[10:52] not you the obstacles the little foxes
[10:56] but our predestination has been chosen
[10:58] already praise the lord
[11:02] so just let us stand hallelujah
[11:04] [Music]
[11:09] our gracious lord hallelujah
[11:12] lord with everything that we have with
[11:15] everything that we have a desire father

[27:16] be still all
[27:21] peace
[27:24] be still
[27:27] often i sailed
[27:30] through life's stormy
[27:35] the situations are proclaiming
[27:39] you will not prevail but
[27:42] your word saves you
[27:46] the raging of the seas
[27:49] when the waves arise
[27:54] still then jesus

[29:12] peace be
[29:15] still
[29:18] and in your darkest hour
[29:23] keep your eyes on jesus when there's
[29:27] fear all around you keep your
[29:30] eyes on jesus all the
[29:34] raging and rolling
[29:37] is trying to make you
[29:41] forget who you have
[29:44] with you
[29:47] [Music]
[29:51] jesus
[29:52] is here
[29:56] waves you won't break me

[30:06] jesus is here
[30:08] [Music]
[30:10] oh ye tempest you will
[30:13] all be still
[30:20] peace
[30:23] [Music]
[30:34] peace
[30:36] be still
[30:37] [Music]
[30:48] peace amen
[30:50] thank you brother isaac god bless you
[30:54] first time i heard that song it did
[30:56] something for me
[30:58] and it was in a time where a lot of
[31:00] things went wrong a lot of things
[31:02] and all at the same time and brother
[31:05] isaac wrote that song a while ago and i
[31:07] never forgot it and i'll never forget it
[31:09] because when
[31:10] the word comes your way it changes
[31:12] something
[31:12] [Music]
[31:13] and a testimony is your testimony
[31:15] because it makes such a mark on you
[31:18] that you cannot walk away from that
[31:19] place it touches you so deep that no
[31:22] matter how many times people reason it
[31:24] out
[31:25] it cannot remove it from what's in here
[31:28] so my whole thought tonight and if you
[31:31] all maybe understand
[31:33] we'll read in the word is
[31:37] calling jesus on the scene so we're
[31:39] going to go to the book of matthew
[31:42] and we're going to read from matthew 8
[31:45] and we'll read
[31:46] from verse 19 and we're going to read to
[31:49] verse 26
[31:50] thank you musicians very much thank you
[31:53] brother isaac
[31:55] before we read it i just want to say
[31:57] something a bit of a disclaimer yeah
[32:01] when we come here we create an
[32:03] atmosphere so god can come
[32:04] down and he can speak to us no man's
[32:08] always got two dwelling places
[32:10] you can either dwell in the heavenlies
[32:13] or you can
[32:14] stay on earth so there's enough of
[32:17] us that can keep our minds occupied
[32:19] tonight but let's leave that for once
[32:21] and let us enter into the heavenlies
[32:24] because that is where overcoming power
[32:26] comes from
[32:28] so on a wednesday when i sell out to a
[32:30] wednesday and and i used to hate
[32:32] long services because i came from a
[32:34] denominational background
[32:36] but see i'm resolved you know
[32:39] i'm sold out so i know i suffer the next
[32:42] day but you know what these things
[32:45] changes lives this is important
[32:48] work is important but this is more
[32:50] important
[32:52] you know and you'll be thankful brother
[32:54] ben said he just sees you drag your body
[32:55] here
[32:56] and you'll drag your body into church
[32:58] and you'll drag your body wherever you
[32:59] have to go to stay away from everything
[33:01] i wonder you're going to drag it into a
[33:02] rapture and we'll thank you for it
[33:04] so let's drag our bodies in here and
[33:07] let's just let god
[33:08] do what god does best hey change our
[33:11] life
[33:12] amen so we start that verse 19
[33:16] and it says a certain scribe came and
[33:18] said unto the
[33:19] said unto him master i will follow thee
[33:23] wherever
[33:24] thou goest and jesus said unto him the
[33:27] foxes have holes
[33:28] and the birds of the air have nests but
[33:31] the son of man
[33:32] have not where to lay his head nowhere
[33:37] and another of his disciples said unto
[33:39] him lord
[33:41] suffer me first to go and bury my father
[33:45] but jesus said unto him follow me
[33:48] capital letter follow me the instruction
[33:52] he says let the dead bury the dead and
[33:56] when he was entered into the ship his
[33:57] disciples followed him
[33:59] and behold there arose the great tempest
[34:01] in the sea in so much that the ship was
[34:04] covered with the waves but he was asleep
[34:08] and his disciples came to him and awoke
[34:10] him saying lord
[34:11] save us we perish and he sayeth unto
[34:14] them
[34:15] why are you fearful oh ye of little
[34:18] faith then he arose and he rebuked the
[34:21] winds
[34:22] and the seas and there was a great calm
[34:26] but the men marveled saying what manner
[34:29] of man is this
[34:30] that even the winds and the seas obey
[34:33] him
[34:34] amen may the lord add his blessing to
[34:36] this word
[34:38] we may be seated so i want to encourage
[34:40] you tonight the reason i ask brother
[34:42] isaac to sing these songs is
[34:44] is because it creates that atmosphere so
[34:48] that we can be attentive to what is
[34:49] going to happen now
[34:51] and thank you brother um phil for for
[34:54] leading tonight and i appreciate
[34:56] everything you guys do for me
[34:57] i just enjoy it so much i'll talk all
[34:59] night so i don't want to do it i just
[35:01] really want to deliver a thought for me
[35:03] the prayer
[35:04] that we do on a wednesday night is so
[35:06] important
[35:07] and we'll hopefully we can hit that
[35:09] tonight just
[35:10] and then and then that might open
[35:13] something up for you why we're here
[35:16] so we look at verse 19 and i'm just
[35:18] going to jump quickly through this
[35:21] this matthew 9. verse 19 we have a
[35:24] scribe
[35:25] and i want you to parallel this journey
[35:28] that jesus is having here and his
[35:30] disciples
[35:31] parallel it with your life so when we
[35:34] speak there put your spiritual cap on
[35:36] and see
[35:37] how you entered this message see how you
[35:40] met christ see what it pertains to you
[35:43] make it personal
[35:44] don't don't make it matthew 9. don't
[35:46] make it matthew 8 don't make it
[35:48] romans and make it yours take it on
[35:51] search your life and say where did this
[35:54] happen in my life
[35:55] because there's some things here that
[35:57] god is showing you that that he's
[35:59] already giving us the victory and he's
[36:00] or giving us the weapons to have the
[36:02] victory
[36:03] but he just wants you to know where you
[36:04] are now where are you now
[36:06] because if you could see where you now
[36:08] you could see the waves coming and you
[36:10] could see the master but i don't want to
[36:11] jump ahead
[36:12] but you can actually see where we are so
[36:15] you don't need to be fearful
[36:16] you don't need to be fearful you just
[36:18] need to call him on the scene
[36:20] so verse 19 it says and a certain scribe
[36:22] came to him and said to him master
[36:24] i will follow thee wherever thou go so
[36:27] of course this guy he was sitting
[36:29] and there was a prayer line going you
[36:31] know and
[36:32] and jesus christ was healing the sick
[36:35] and he was
[36:36] casting out demons and miracles happen
[36:38] and lame threw their crutches away and
[36:40] everything was happening and the scribe
[36:42] was all there because the scribe
[36:43] takes down notes he makes sure he
[36:45] doesn't miss anything
[36:47] and a testimony of the testimony of the
[36:49] testimony of the testimony of the
[36:51] vindication of the vindication
[36:53] every time jesus spoke no man spoke like
[36:55] this things happen
[36:56] and this guy he's zealous he says man
[37:00] he comes to jesus and he says to him and
[37:02] this is a wonderful thing and i don't
[37:03] think they emphasize it good enough yes
[37:05] this
[37:05] and the certain scripture said to him
[37:07] master
[37:08] i will follow you wherever you go so
[37:11] he's now
[37:12] he's now decided i'm going to follow
[37:14] jesus okay he's happy i'm going to
[37:16] follow this jesus because
[37:18] things happen around this man you know
[37:20] this is more than a man
[37:23] okay think about the message think about
[37:26] your life
[37:27] and i was in the world and i heard
[37:29] something it prickled my ears
[37:31] and so i was more than a man or that
[37:33] miracle oh that prayer line something
[37:34] started prickly mind going oh
[37:36] there's more amen you know this is not a
[37:38] dead book there's more
[37:40] so i said master i will follow you
[37:44] i just want to be part of you i want to
[37:45] just be in it oh yes
[37:49] so now jesus gives him a warning
[37:52] look at verse 20 he says that jesus
[37:55] saith unto him
[37:56] the foxes have holes and the birds of
[37:58] the air have nests
[37:59] but the son of man hath nowhere to lay
[38:02] his head
[38:03] so he's saying i have no place where i
[38:06] call home here
[38:07] because this is not my home and if
[38:09] you're going to follow me
[38:10] you ain't going to have a bit of ease
[38:12] just
[38:13] can i just move this away sorry it's
[38:16] restricting me
[38:16] you know you're not gonna have a bit of
[38:18] ease
[38:20] okay it's there's gonna be some
[38:22] decisions coming
[38:23] there's gonna be stuff happening because
[38:25] i'm gonna come here to settle down
[38:27] build my little house and just say
[38:29] that's it it made it
[38:30] and i'm a christian he said no no if you
[38:32] walk with me
[38:34] we we're gonna fight some battles that's
[38:35] right so he gives him a warning though
[38:37] he says reap between the lines there's a
[38:39] warning coming
[38:41] so now we see the disciple come ahead
[38:44] and the disciple now comes to jesus and
[38:46] these are devout men that calls him
[38:48] their master their rabbi this is a very
[38:50] devout man that follows every word of
[38:52] jesus that believes it
[38:54] not like the scribe the scribe is just a
[38:56] reporter he's just happy
[38:58] but the disciple is a bit different he's
[39:01] been there before he's got teaching from
[39:02] the
[39:03] from from jesus no man spoke like this
[39:05] they went through the scriptures
[39:06] searching the scriptures so they they
[39:08] bit more into the
[39:09] into the word but listen to this man
[39:12] he goes there and he says and another of
[39:14] his disciples said unto him lord
[39:16] suffer me first to go and bury my father
[39:19] it's a good request say lord i just want
[39:23] to go take care of this business
[39:25] and then i'll be in the boat with you
[39:27] i'll jump in
[39:29] and what does jesus say unto him he says
[39:31] to me
[39:32] follow me capital letter
[39:36] follow me and let the date bury the dead
[39:38] so saying now here i come out of this
[39:41] world and i'm infused with the message
[39:44] and it's preaching jesus christ and i
[39:45] spring up in church and i go amen and
[39:48] everything
[39:48] and now it comes to a side where jesus
[39:50] says now leave all that behind
[39:53] leave it all behind now you follow me
[39:57] it's going to be a tough road but now
[39:59] you are going to walk with me
[40:02] now you can't worry about the dead you
[40:05] can't worry about
[40:06] all the things hollywood all this other
[40:09] stuff don't worry about it
[40:11] remember we're here for a pre-meeting
[40:13] children
[40:15] eyes on the prize because one day
[40:18] jesus will call you to follow him don't
[40:22] miss this
[40:23] because that call will come and you'll
[40:24] be kneeling at the altar and after you
[40:26] gave your heart to the lord there's a
[40:28] couple of things we need to do
[40:29] and when we get here what do we do then
[40:33] so nobody said this is a flowery bit of
[40:35] it but jesus said
[40:36] when i call you and you cannot come here
[40:39] there's something you're gonna have to
[40:40] do
[40:41] because you don't just jump in the boat
[40:43] there's a certain way to get into this
[40:44] gospel boat
[40:45] there's a certain way in a strict
[40:47] instruction and you children
[40:49] and our spirits all come the same way
[40:54] you have to be born again the message
[40:57] of this hour if you're in a message
[41:00] church do not
[41:01] save you amen period
[41:05] if you tell me i've been this message
[41:06] and i've walked in this message 25 years
[41:09] doesn't mean
[41:09] nothing i heard it i heard it too many
[41:13] times
[41:14] then you made the message to the
[41:15] nomination then you through jesus christ
[41:18] the person he introduced away
[41:21] this message don't save people
[41:25] sorry i believe this message i eat this
[41:28] message
[41:29] but it introduced a person and the
[41:32] message took all these doctrines and
[41:34] creeds and confusion
[41:36] and it opened it just up for you so what
[41:39] are we eating hey
[41:41] what are we eating so sorry i get
[41:43] passionate about these things because it
[41:45] means something to me because
[41:46] i wasn't a denominational chicken once
[41:49] but i was an eagle but i was scratching
[41:51] around there and nobody came with these
[41:54] answers so but don't become a
[41:57] denominational chicken
[41:58] a message denominational chicken amen
[42:02] because measles don't save you i know
[42:04] jesus christ saves you
[42:07] so now the next step we need to get in
[42:10] that boat so what do we do to get in the
[42:11] boat
[42:12] very important jesus says
[42:15] in matthew 7 14 he says enter ye
[42:18] at the straight gate for wide is the
[42:21] gate and that's verse 13
[42:23] and broad is the way that leadeth to
[42:25] destruction and many are there
[42:27] be which go in there it it says because
[42:31] straight now see how they spell that
[42:33] straight
[42:33] brother um uh
[42:36] ed can you maybe put that up that verse
[42:38] 14 so matthew 7 verse 14
[42:41] he says but straight yeah
[42:45] now tell me do you use do you spell
[42:47] straight and i'm afrikan's
[42:49] first language so for me spelling is
[42:51] it's a monumentous challenge
[42:53] but tell me that's straight does that
[42:55] mean
[42:56] straight
[43:03] but i did some homework that's straight
[43:06] i'm going to get to it now you see
[43:08] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[43:10] way
[43:11] which leadeth unto life and few
[43:14] there be that find it amen
[43:17] so jesus is busy telling his disciples
[43:19] there's one way to get into here
[43:21] and you're going to have to use the
[43:23] straight gate
[43:24] so if we look at a straight and i went
[43:26] and i said mr google please tell me
[43:28] about straight he says
[43:29] it's a narrow passage of water
[43:33] it's usually connecting two seas large
[43:37] assets of water together
[43:39] so it's a place where two oceans combine
[43:42] it's a straight
[43:43] okay and then the second definition
[43:46] which i thought would fit in so nicely
[43:48] is it's used in a reference to a
[43:51] situation that character
[43:52] characterized by a specified degree of
[43:56] trouble and difficulty
[43:59] so then he says here the the economy
[44:02] is in dire straits
[44:06] so jesus basically if you read between
[44:08] the lines it says you're going to have
[44:09] to come away
[44:10] but it's going to be difficult because
[44:12] some church
[44:13] in the in in the the what was it what
[44:16] they call that age brother andy
[44:19] the church that came with pepper rome
[44:21] and all those things that that
[44:23] oh yeah yeah so the catholic church came
[44:26] and they said oh if you're baptized in
[44:28] the name of father son and holy ghost
[44:29] that doctrine
[44:30] okay from the catholic church if yeah
[44:33] okay i'll get there but what happened is
[44:36] he's the library we'll just
[44:37] display so so they came with a false
[44:39] baptism and jesus knew this
[44:42] they knew it but it still says one name
[44:45] he says what is the name of the father
[44:49] the son and the holy ghost you don't go
[44:52] what's the name of the father
[44:54] the name of the son and the name of the
[44:56] holy ghost now i know this is maybe a
[44:58] bit
[44:58] it's one name singular one name then it
[45:01] says
[45:02] and he says that a lot of people will be
[45:04] thrown off by this little
[45:06] waterway this little small narrow way
[45:09] to get into you but luckily we have the
[45:12] truth
[45:12] praise the lord because in acts 2 38 now
[45:15] when the book of acts continues
[45:17] peter stands up and he says unto them
[45:19] repent and be baptized every one of you
[45:22] in the name of jesus christ
[45:25] for the remission of your sins and ye
[45:27] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[45:28] for the promises unto you
[45:30] and your children and as far off as what
[45:33] and as many as the lord our god so cool
[45:36] so there's a certain way children
[45:39] parents people that we get into this
[45:42] this gospel ship okay so there's a
[45:45] little bit of doctrine that's our
[45:46] through that that's a little sunny
[45:47] school lesson
[45:48] you cannot bypass it you cannot come by
[45:50] the window
[45:51] you cannot come any other way you'll be
[45:53] thrown out you have to come through that
[45:55] way
[45:56] that's it so so brother caleb leave that
[46:00] up there please because i might refer to
[46:02] it again
[46:04] so okay here i go i say lord jesus
[46:08] i'm gonna follow you i'm gonna pick a
[46:10] side today i wanna
[46:11] and that's what i did and and i did this
[46:14] in faith i didn't know what was going to
[46:15] happen
[46:16] so i walked through the water and asked
[46:17] brother ben i've never seen
[46:19] so much fear on someone's face than mine
[46:22] before i got baptized we had a photo
[46:25] there
[46:26] and if you would see the look on my face
[46:28] and i would
[46:29] i wanted to have it here but i didn't
[46:30] know i was going to go down this way so
[46:32] sorry it was a kind of a bit of a segway
[46:33] but
[46:34] i was scared to get baptized
[46:38] for what was scared to get baptized me
[46:40] the real me
[46:42] or that spirit that was on me yeah there
[46:44] we go because he knew once i did that
[46:46] and i decided to change
[46:48] sides now all of a sudden now things got
[46:51] real
[46:52] because when i was partying in the world
[46:54] and doing all these things he was happy
[46:55] you just go yeah go and there's more and
[46:57] there's more and there's more and you
[46:58] love quick and you'll love don't
[46:59] games and all those things i did pretty
[47:01] much everything you can think except
[47:02] drugs
[47:03] praise the lord i never did it but i did
[47:06] everything and he left me alone to do
[47:08] all of that
[47:09] but the moment i picked this side
[47:11] [Music]
[47:15] things change things change glory
[47:18] so now we we've and this is how it
[47:20] happened with me we decided to get
[47:22] baptized it wasn't this
[47:23] massive woo moment but the whole
[47:26] experience going through it i didn't
[47:28] come out of the water feeling anything
[47:29] different but
[47:31] clean i didn't feel the holy spirit
[47:34] brush over me i didn't feel
[47:36] tongues and others say i didn't feel
[47:37] anything fancy because it was a sincere
[47:40] moment where i picked a side
[47:42] that's it god said because i picked a
[47:44] sign i came out of the water and had the
[47:46] privilege of leading my wife into the
[47:48] water
[47:48] and she went and she got baptized as
[47:50] well and praise the lord we both started
[47:52] walking
[47:52] and then of course the first two days we
[47:55] had honeymoon
[47:56] because it was it was nice you know and
[47:59] the preacher preaches the right message
[48:01] on the sunday for the baptism
[48:02] and and he's so friendly and all the
[48:04] brothers and sisters shakes my hand they
[48:06] go god bless you and you
[48:07] oh they're all so happy and i have
[48:08] honeymoon a honeymoon i'm now
[48:11] in the gospel show and the ship sits off
[48:14] and now it starts sailing all the way
[48:16] down
[48:16] we're going jesus is in the boat and
[48:18] we're celebrating and i'm a christian
[48:20] and i'm saved and
[48:21] i'm bubbling all the way down the street
[48:23] and i sang that song that brother
[48:24] for you saying it um what was that last
[48:27] one we said when uh the the short one
[48:28] second last one
[48:32] no no no the other one on top of it
[48:37] no no the one that
[48:40] it was something beautiful
[48:44] yeah you have something beautiful
[48:45] something right this is all my confusion
[48:47] sorry i just couldn't get i couldn't get
[48:48] the song he understood so i was actually
[48:51] working on the roads back then
[48:52] shoveling roads and singing bubbling and
[48:55] you know whistler i promise you
[48:56] and people whistle it past me and i was
[48:58] on honeymoon it was glorious
[49:01] and in the wednesday they broke into my
[49:03] house
[49:04] amen for praise the lord they stole all
[49:07] my games
[49:08] they stole everything they had to steal
[49:10] to get rid of it because i was still a
[49:11] bit addicted to that thing
[49:13] so they stole my playstation they stole
[49:15] the games they stole
[49:16] everything anything electronic without
[49:19] my house
[49:20] and guess what i didn't have insurance
[49:24] and i wasn't getting paid much either so
[49:26] i couldn't just replace it so praise the
[49:28] lord
[49:28] the way those things came into my house
[49:30] man like this
[49:32] i had a friend that was a cricket
[49:33] captain and he basically
[49:35] offloaded everything to me dvds games
[49:38] that
[49:38] i thought man this is cool these kiwi
[49:41] people love us
[49:42] you know they just give us games and
[49:44] everything i never saw
[49:46] what was happening until it was given
[49:48] away and i was actually a bit angry at
[49:50] the guys for breaking into my house i
[49:51] felt like
[49:52] violated you know like why would you
[49:53] break into my house and steal my stuff
[49:55] so now i'm off track but i just want to
[49:56] say something and then my wife said just
[49:58] pray for these people
[49:59] yeah because they might need that i see
[50:03] but they broke into my house i'm angry
[50:04] man and she goes yeah but just pray for
[50:06] them anyways yeah
[50:07] yeah why the answer i they don't
[50:09] understand it i understand it now
[50:12] but that time oh i just wanted to i
[50:14] wanted to catch somebody
[50:16] so now all of a sudden
[50:20] all of a sudden we go to verse 24
[50:23] and it says here and behold there are
[50:26] raves
[50:27] a great tempest in the sea in so much
[50:30] that the ship was
[50:31] covered with waves now i'm going to stop
[50:34] just there
[50:36] now we're in the gospel we're in the of
[50:39] the hour
[50:41] and some brother says something to you
[50:45] and it cuts and it hurts
[50:48] and you think why would he say that
[50:53] and it says in the rose and a great
[50:55] tempest
[50:56] in the sea in so much that the ship was
[50:59] covered
[51:01] i come to the altar
[51:04] and i pray for healing and it's not
[51:07] happening
[51:08] and i'm devastated why not
[51:12] i'm praying i'm a sincere christian
[51:14] praying for healing
[51:15] what's going on is it my faith is it the
[51:18] lack of it
[51:20] is it the promise of god that's not real
[51:22] i'm here i'm praying
[51:24] i'm not getting healed i've got a son or
[51:27] a daughter running in the world
[51:29] they don't care and i pray and i pray
[51:32] and i pray
[51:33] nothing's happening and i start doubting
[51:38] i start doubting i feel it i was there
[51:42] every son of god and every daughter of
[51:45] god
[51:46] will be tested but that don't make them
[51:49] less a son and daughter of god
[51:52] just want to bring it on level playing
[51:53] field
[51:55] but see we are stuff from the lord i
[51:58] pray for revelation
[51:59] i i asked for something that god would
[52:01] reveal to me maybe serpent seed or
[52:03] baptism or anything i pray for it and
[52:05] god's not answering
[52:08] i just don't understand i'm just a
[52:10] little sheep lord i'm just crying out
[52:13] why don't you hear me
[52:16] but we see it and we want to get angry
[52:19] but see you
[52:20] forfeited your right to get angry
[52:22] [Music]
[52:24] you're forfeited you're right to argue
[52:26] back
[52:28] you forfeited that right
[52:31] you can ask and you can ask
[52:35] and you can knock and you can knock but
[52:37] you forfeited your right to kick the
[52:39] door down
[52:40] you forfeited that right because god is
[52:44] sovereign and he knew what's in your
[52:45] heart
[52:46] before he chose you and before he drew
[52:49] you
[52:49] you forfeit it or if you don't
[52:51] understand it leave it just a bit
[52:54] it doesn't mean if we go to the list
[52:57] but jesus was asleep that doesn't mean
[52:59] god is sleeping
[53:01] that means god is dealing amen that's
[53:04] right
[53:04] that means god is dealing that's right
[53:06] that's right yes sir
[53:08] he didn't save you to lose you he didn't
[53:11] bring you
[53:11] in just to tell you you don't have
[53:13] overcoming power amen okay
[53:16] same counts for everyone because when
[53:17] you get baptized
[53:19] it says and for and it says here and the
[53:21] promise is unto you
[53:23] and your children and to all that are
[53:27] far
[53:27] off as many as the lord our gods are
[53:29] called so as long as god is calling
[53:31] that's how long we shall be walking and
[53:33] praying
[53:35] so don't stop you that promise for
[53:36] nothing amen
[53:38] okay amen amen
[53:42] now you cried and you cried and you
[53:44] prayed and you prayed
[53:46] and you begged and you begged and you're
[53:48] at the point where you cannot go anymore
[53:51] let me tell you something let's go to
[53:53] luke 18.
[53:58] let's go to luke 18.
[54:08] and we're to read this from verse 1 and
[54:11] we're going to read there
[54:14] and it says at the same time
[54:20] at the same time came the disciples unto
[54:23] jesus saying
[54:25] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[54:26] heaven
[54:28] oh wait sorry sorry i got that wrong
[54:30] sorry
[54:31] that's not it i think it's i've turned
[54:34] my page back luke 18 sorry this is good
[54:36] again sorry i didn't turn the page i
[54:39] would say
[54:40] here we go
[54:46] and he spake about he spoke a parable
[54:48] unto them
[54:50] to this end that men ought always do
[54:57] and that men ought always to
[55:00] and that men ought always to pray amen
[55:04] and not faint
[55:10] saying there is this there is in a city
[55:12] a judge
[55:13] which feareth not god neither regarded
[55:15] man and there was a widow in that city
[55:18] and she came unto him saying
[55:20] avenge me of my adversary and he said
[55:22] not for a while
[55:25] but afterward he said within himself
[55:27] though i fear not god or a god not men
[55:30] yet because this woman troubleth me i
[55:34] will avenge at least
[55:35] by her continual coming
[55:38] she wears me and the lord said
[55:42] hear what the unjust just say amen and
[55:45] shall not god avenge his own elect which
[55:48] cry day and night unto him
[55:50] amen though we bear along with them
[55:54] i tell you that he will avenge them
[55:57] speedily
[55:58] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[56:01] shall he
[56:02] find faith on the earth
[56:05] amen not overcoming power
[56:11] not perfect people faith because every
[56:16] promise in this word is for
[56:17] us everyone and he's only asked you to
[56:21] believe
[56:22] only believe what did the prophet preach
[56:24] only believe all things are possible
[56:26] now he's saying before i come back
[56:28] before the son of god is revealed
[56:30] if i come back shall i find faith
[56:35] so we just need to hang in no matter
[56:37] what happens we just need to hang on
[56:39] amen no matter what happens
[56:43] amen that's right just hang on
[56:48] the reason for it in romans 7
[56:51] and i'll just read it it's verse 18 to
[56:53] 23 it says for
[56:55] i know ben said it on on sunday and it
[56:57] touched me so much he says for i know
[56:59] that
[56:59] in me that is the flesh dwelleth no good
[57:02] thing
[57:03] for i for to will is present with me
[57:08] but how to perform which is good i find
[57:11] not
[57:12] for the good that i would i do not but
[57:15] the evil which i would not
[57:17] that i do now if i don't do that
[57:20] which i would not it is no more either
[57:24] do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[57:29] i find then a law so
[57:33] so here in romans paul's speaking about
[57:35] this law
[57:36] and he says i find a law that when
[57:39] i would do good evil is present with me
[57:42] so now remember when we preach the
[57:44] greatest battle ever fought
[57:46] now basically what happens is he says i
[57:49] find
[57:50] that when i try to do good evil is right
[57:53] at the door
[57:54] he says but now look at the let's look
[57:56] at the the
[57:57] um the types here he says
[58:01] verse 22 for right the light in the law
[58:03] of
[58:05] god so there's a law of god
[58:08] okay which wareth against or
[58:12] warring against the law of the mind
[58:16] okay and bringing me uh
[58:19] but i see another oh sorry sorry sorry
[58:22] sorry sorry
[58:22] he says for i delighted from the law of
[58:24] god which is the inward man so that's
[58:26] your soul man that's your soul
[58:28] okay that comes from god that's the holy
[58:30] spirit is in there but i see another law
[58:32] in my members
[58:34] so there's a second law and this is the
[58:37] the the man that fights the game god
[58:39] that this is satan
[58:41] and this is this is god so your flesh
[58:44] the fallen man fighting against the law
[58:48] god which is in you so this is to do
[58:50] fighting but look where they fight they
[58:52] say
[58:53] warring against the law of my mind
[58:56] and bringing him into captivity to the
[58:59] law of sin which
[59:00] is in my members so now he's saying i
[59:02] identify
[59:03] the moment i start making things wrong
[59:06] there's something here going on
[59:08] and then most of the battles is here
[59:10] doubt
[59:11] faith you know belief unbelief god's
[59:14] promise
[59:15] i don't get the promise um uh i've i've
[59:18] written a couple of things that i maybe
[59:20] want to touch it quickly because it's
[59:21] gonna
[59:21] it's gonna come to the story
[59:25] he says here this is what happens in our
[59:27] body faith versus doubt believing
[59:30] unbelief
[59:31] spirit against the flesh soul against
[59:33] the body
[59:34] we we get so worked up by which dog are
[59:37] you feeding
[59:40] which dog are we thinking remember you'd
[59:42] preach that
[59:43] how's your diet so jesus says i'm in the
[59:47] boat he's in the boat he's not asleep
[59:50] he didn't forget he's not slumbering
[59:53] he's just putting you in a situation
[59:55] where you just have to find your feet
[59:57] just work on that faith muscles
[59:59] just go boob devil back because he's
[1:00:02] already got the answer
[1:00:04] i'll show you now
[1:00:08] here comes a lady and she comes to
[1:00:09] brother branham
[1:00:11] and i'm sorry i'm taking a bit longer i
[1:00:13] really apologize for that
[1:00:15] and he says and she says to brother
[1:00:17] branham she says
[1:00:18] jesus christ was a man
[1:00:22] and brother branham goes everybody was
[1:00:24] god
[1:00:25] he said okay i'll prove it i'll prove it
[1:00:26] by the scriptures he was a man
[1:00:28] and she goes to the book of where
[1:00:30] lazarus is in the grave
[1:00:31] and jesus walks to the grave and he's
[1:00:34] crying
[1:00:37] he's crying because he loves lazarus she
[1:00:40] sees see
[1:00:41] he's a man she goes okay but when they
[1:00:44] rolled away that human he says lazarus
[1:00:46] come
[1:00:47] forth he was god amen now here's jesus
[1:00:50] in the boat
[1:00:51] sleeping tired resting he was a man
[1:00:57] but when he came on that boat and all
[1:01:00] the disciples were doubting he says fear
[1:01:02] not
[1:01:02] i don't know why you're fearing i'm here
[1:01:05] and he said
[1:01:06] be still that's it amen and everything
[1:01:10] in nature kept quiet
[1:01:12] now here's the devil raging at you your
[1:01:15] children won't come in
[1:01:16] yeah come on you don't have enough faith
[1:01:19] the rapture is not for you
[1:01:20] healing is not yours you're an
[1:01:22] unbeliever
[1:01:24] keep doubting who's calling jesus on the
[1:01:27] scene
[1:01:29] who's calling him when it gets too rough
[1:01:31] and you you want to tap out
[1:01:33] why don't you go to the boat and wake
[1:01:35] jesus up why don't you go and say lord
[1:01:38] i know you're sovereign but i'm
[1:01:40] struggling here i can't fight this
[1:01:42] battle
[1:01:43] i'm not winning but come fight it for me
[1:01:47] amen and then god comes and he says i
[1:01:49] the lord shall fight for you
[1:01:50] you shall hold your peace and god will
[1:01:53] take that battle
[1:01:54] he will fight it for you but we have to
[1:01:56] get to that point where we know
[1:01:58] that it's not your how good you are for
[1:02:01] how long you are
[1:02:03] it's god's promise in this word so why
[1:02:06] do we come tonight for a pre-meeting
[1:02:09] no i don't i i honestly come here every
[1:02:11] time we pray here
[1:02:12] i have someone i want to pray for
[1:02:15] someone i testify to
[1:02:16] somewhere i need help and guidance this
[1:02:19] is why i come here
[1:02:21] so we're here so let's pray to the
[1:02:25] living god to come on the scene to
[1:02:26] change these things
[1:02:28] yes our children our friends our family
[1:02:30] or workmates
[1:02:31] amen i did not come here
[1:02:34] to get blown over by waves amen i didn't
[1:02:38] come here to get shipwrecked i came here
[1:02:41] to call
[1:02:42] jesus on the scene amen lord jesus there
[1:02:45] is nothing
[1:02:47] nothing that god can't do amen
[1:02:52] we believe in the sovereign god that
[1:02:53] created heaven and all his glory
[1:02:56] that has sovereignity that can come into
[1:02:58] a room and dwell with his people and go
[1:03:00] out
[1:03:00] and you can feel these presents and you
[1:03:02] can see miracles and people can get eyes
[1:03:04] in the
[1:03:04] these sockets and they can throw
[1:03:06] crutches away and walk
[1:03:08] see it was all good when the prophet was
[1:03:09] preaching it the people believed because
[1:03:11] it was there the anointing was there
[1:03:13] where did it go
[1:03:15] where did it go when did miracles stop
[1:03:19] come on when i find it hard to believe
[1:03:23] yeah come on
[1:03:24] that's right huh it's not a camp to camp
[1:03:27] to camp to catch the camp
[1:03:28] we're making ready for camp we're not
[1:03:30] making ready for camp this
[1:03:32] is camp this is camp glorious
[1:03:36] so yes maybe some people feel they want
[1:03:39] to do fishing at camp
[1:03:40] it's fine get them there because one
[1:03:42] moment in god's atmosphere can change
[1:03:44] their life
[1:03:45] amen changes my life okay so whosoever
