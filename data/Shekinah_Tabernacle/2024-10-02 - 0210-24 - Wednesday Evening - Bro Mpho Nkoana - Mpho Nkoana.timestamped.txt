[26:31] let's read Romans chapter 8 it's my
[26:34] favorite chapter
[26:36] lately but we'll just read I would like
[26:38] us to read a lot more but let's just
[26:41] read two verses and then we see we pray
[26:44] and sit
[26:46] down are we all there once you are there
[26:48] just say
[26:50] Amen it's a powerful verse man if you
[26:53] just read this verse with me there is
[26:56] therefore now no condemnation
[26:59] to them which are in Christ
[27:02] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[27:06] after the spirit for the law of the
[27:10] spirit of life is in Christ Jesus ha
[27:14] made me me he has made
[27:18] me H me free from the law of sin and
[27:23] death our heavenly father Lord Jesus
[27:26] Christ father what can we say to these
[27:29] things Lord it just humbles us to
[27:32] realize that father out of billions and
[27:35] billions and billions of people that you
[27:38] could
[27:39] foree and choose but you chose me Lord
[27:43] me and an
[27:45] insignificant human
[27:48] being from insignificant
[27:51] people from born by a father and a
[27:55] mother in the way of sin Lord you chose
[27:58] me Father God and you chose each and
[28:01] every one of us we are so privileged
[28:03] father we want to thank you for reading
[28:05] your word tonight we know that anyone
[28:08] can open this Bible read it even better
[28:11] than us that is why we are asking you
[28:14] Lord to come tonight and Inspire it get
[28:17] me out of the way father because there's
[28:19] nothing that I can do to your for your
[28:20] people come and speak come and use the
[28:23] lips of this men lord to bless your
[28:27] people thank encourage them Lord to
[28:29] motivate them Lord to reassure them Lord

[28:34] every desire every need be answered
[28:37] father we commit the service into your
[28:39] hands in the name of our Lord and savior
[28:42] our loving father Our Redeemer Lord
[28:45] Jesus Christ amen amen you can sit um I
[28:48] want to welcome my dear friend H rhyo at
[28:52] the back there thanks for coming
[28:56] Rhino and uh
[28:58] Rhino I told him that hey I'm I'm I'm
[29:01] the one who's preaching tonight he said
[29:03] ah I'll come I said but look don't come
[29:05] because because I'm preaching I'm
[29:08] actually I can't I can't give you
[29:09] anything but I invited him before I knew
[29:12] that I was going to preach today because
[29:15] R Rhino is my sorry to put on the sport
[29:18] Buddha because he he's the one who sold
[29:21] me a little car that you see me driving
[29:23] around here H so but because the
[29:26] footsteps of the righteous are order of
[29:28] the Lord I don't believe it was about
[29:31] the car so we started talking about God
[29:34] and here here is Right visiting us with
[29:36] us tonight may God bless you my brother
[29:38] he has F said Africa
[29:41] off so what I meant by that for for you
[29:45] Q is that he's also from South
[29:50] Africa so welcome righto and just feel
[29:54] free at home all these are brothers and
[29:55] sisters talk to anyone after the service
[29:57] if you you want to when they approach
[29:59] you they just love you it's because we
[30:01] are Christians so just feel at home and
[30:04] uh only take what I say not what about
[30:08] who about me so may God bless you
[30:10] tonight we have read we have read this
[30:12] powerful scripture and if you listen to
[30:16] verse two it talks about H for the law
[30:19] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus ha
[30:22] made me free from the law of sin and
[30:25] death that's initially that's what I
[30:27] wanted to speak speak about which we I
[30:30] can't talk about tonight we'll talk
[30:32] about it some other time but that
[30:34] thought is just so powerful these two
[30:36] laws are so powerful I wanted us to talk
[30:40] about them more in the context of the
[30:42] greatest battle that is being fought
[30:44] right now but we'll talk about this some
[30:46] other time somehow along the way the
[30:48] Lord just changed my thoughts and
[30:50] inspired me to speak about led by the
[30:54] spirit being led by the spirit so
[30:58] and as usual if you just hear me calling
[31:01] your name please don't take offense I I
[31:04] mean it in a good way I just mean to
[31:06] engage and to participate with you I
[31:09] don't mean to put you on the sport I I
[31:11] like when I
[31:13] talk for people to follow what I'm
[31:15] trying to say so the only way that I do
[31:17] that is to say Hey you get it David you
[31:20] know so just like when you talk I want
[31:23] you to understand that I'm attentively
[31:25] listening to you I was remanded One Time
[31:29] by my dear sister K but by not looking
[31:32] at her when she was greeting me so so I
[31:35] know that when someone talks to you pay
[31:37] attention to
[31:39] them so it's good to have Elders Among
[31:41] Us and and and listen to
[31:45] them I like sister K because she she's
[31:49] sister
[31:53] K so brothers and sisters I won't be
[31:55] long tonight but I want us to look at
[31:58] this thought of being led by the
[32:00] spirit and uh just take a few a few uh
[32:04] things around this thought brother bham
[32:07] the messenger of this hour preached this
[32:09] sermon a few times and H using different
[32:13] titles and but it just set on my heart
[32:16] to be led by the
[32:18] spirit you know it's such a deep H topic
[32:21] for me to be led by the spirit it has
[32:24] got so many aspects and I don't have a
[32:26] spreadsheet tonight I mean a PowerPoint
[32:29] I'll just go through my notes and my
[32:31] notes are are available for you if you
[32:34] want me to email you to read them um but
[32:38] let's just understand what is the
[32:39] meaning or the context of this word lead
[32:44] to be
[32:45] led what because many times we just say
[32:49] words and we speak them without
[32:51] internalizing them to be led in the
[32:54] context of what we are talking about
[32:55] here today tonight is that
[32:58] you know to be
[33:00] led you've got to have been surrendered
[33:03] right to be led you you you you must
[33:08] agree and uh can you imagine a sheep
[33:11] that I'm leading and I'm I'm the
[33:12] shepherd but that that does not has not
[33:15] fully surrendered me as a she to me as a
[33:18] Shepherd it will get lost the Wolves and
[33:21] the J calls can grab it because it goes
[33:24] astray it goes different ways it does
[33:25] different things and it's here in the in
[33:27] the flock but it's not here so to be led
[33:31] has got a lot of a lot to do with also
[33:35] surrendering you know giving yourself
[33:37] amen so it's not about you or me
[33:41] continuing to have self trust you know
[33:44] it's about letting go letting everything
[33:48] that you can do for yourself to know
[33:51] that Jesus Christ can do it better for
[33:54] you so so so so so all you human
[33:58] capabilities means nothing when it comes
[34:01] to surrendering being led by the Lord
[34:03] all of them they are secondary right the
[34:07] primary person becomes the leader the
[34:09] one who whom is leading you in other
[34:11] words when you make decisions when you
[34:14] when you think when you process things
[34:16] when you live your life daily you are
[34:18] under this
[34:20] leading so you also have to be able to
[34:24] to to to to to be sensitive
[34:28] to to this one that is leading you to
[34:31] his instructions to his uh H you know
[34:34] coachings because he's your Mentor he's
[34:37] everything to you we read there that
[34:38] he's he's he's got an amazing love he's
[34:40] our friend our father he's everything to
[34:43] us so you need to be able to to know
[34:46] your Shepherd and and and and be led by
[34:49] his instruction by his spirit amen so
[34:52] that is the context that I want us to be
[34:54] and also to be sensitive about what what
[34:57] he want you to do because if you are not
[34:59] careful you can actually agree and want
[35:03] to do that but if you are not sensitive
[35:05] if you're not careful all what is
[35:07] teaching you can pass you above the head
[35:10] because you're not being sensitive
[35:12] you're not being careful I mean you know
[35:14] the holy spirit is
[35:16] sensitive very sensitive and I
[35:20] Was preparing the suon and then somehow
[35:23] I just went out and I saw this pigeon
[35:26] called a
[35:30] a that is a
[35:32] pigeon yeah it's a wild pigeon
[35:36] and those Bears they are very sensitive
[35:39] they eat
[35:40] seeds they they don't just eat anything
[35:42] and find a dead dog and start eating
[35:45] there or they're sensitive like the holy
[35:48] spirit is the holy spirit is is so
[35:49] sensitive even if you are the Son of God
[35:52] and you offend the Holy Spirit he's not
[35:54] happy you'll stand there and you you
[35:57] repent he
[35:58] comes you see but that does not change
[36:02] the fact that you are a son of God but
[36:03] don't offend him be sensitive what I'm
[36:05] trying to we're not talking about
[36:06] offending the Holy Spirit we're just
[36:07] talking about being sensitive to the
[36:09] spirit of the Lord and being sensitive
[36:12] to the spirit of the Lord it means
[36:13] you'll also be sensitive to the people
[36:15] of God because those people have got God
[36:18] inside them they've got the spirit of
[36:20] the living you'll be sensitive to them
[36:23] when you talk to them when you deal with
[36:25] them when you think about them when you
[36:27] engage with them you you'll be sensitive
[36:29] because you you are dealing with God am
[36:32] I right so that's the context of this
[36:36] word lead to be led the the attitude of
[36:42] I
[36:43] know doesn't work
[36:45] there me and my
[36:47] studies and my wisdom whatever I can
[36:52] think of is zil is there such a word
[36:56] zero yes is zero it means Z
[37:01] zero I just want to emphasize that about
[37:03] me it means nothing I'm nothing before
[37:06] the Lord my thinking my whatever even
[37:09] the most intelligent person amen but
[37:11] let's go back to this chapter because I
[37:13] love it so
[37:15] much and and I'll jump I'll hop between
[37:19] different uh
[37:21] verses uh like brother Greg was doing
[37:24] but I want to you to look at the this
[37:28] chapter every every time where I read
[37:31] what the word says about the spirit
[37:34] right let's just go on and jump to verse
[37:39] four but let's just let's just go from
[37:41] verse three where we ended for what the
[37:44] law could not do in that it was weak
[37:47] through the flesh God seen in In the
[37:50] Flesh
[37:52] sorry is that right that the righteous
[37:56] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[37:58] walk not after the flesh but after the
[38:01] spirit so we walk after the spirit verse
[38:05] five for they that are after The Flesh
[38:09] do mind the things of the
[38:12] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[38:15] the things of the spirit so it's already
[38:18] showing you there's
[38:19] two if you mind the things of the
[38:23] flesh you're that side or you thinking
[38:26] you you can be a son and daughter of God
[38:28] and just have this thorn of just minding
[38:31] the that must be removed so that the
[38:33] Holy Spirit can completely lead you
[38:36] right for to be kindly minded is
[38:41] death but to be spiritually minded is
[38:44] life and peace that's for you and I'm
[38:47] not kidding if you listen to this
[38:49] chapter first verse it opens up with a
[38:52] promise for you there is therefore now
[38:56] no more
[38:58] condemnation this is a guarantee it's a
[39:01] promise right through this chapter if
[39:04] you read it you find your promises I
[39:06] didn't give them to you God gave them to
[39:08] you they're yours but he wants me and
[39:11] you to be led by him at all times and to
[39:16] learn to know how he operates and the
[39:19] only way to learn to know God and to
[39:21] experience him is through the spirit of
[39:23] the Living God no capacity no ability of
[39:26] men can teach you through that process
[39:29] it's only through the spirit so I cannot
[39:32] overemphasize the importance of ensuring
[39:36] that you have the Holy Spirit of the
[39:38] Living God and you cry before God to
[39:40] give it to you so that he can lead you
[39:43] because it's much
[39:45] easier when you is you sealed in inside
[39:49] your soul and you're closed have you
[39:51] ever seen a te a tin of
[39:54] H I don't want to say Coke because Coke
[39:56] you can just press like this and says
[39:58] and open it a tin of like you know
[40:02] beans not this new ones with a little
[40:05] Clips is like no no a sealed one the one
[40:07] we open with the te open ch ch ch that
[40:09] one it's sealed it's sealed completely
[40:12] closed it's like you when the Holy
[40:15] Spirit is sealed you huh it's much
[40:19] easier when you make an error when you
[40:22] it's much easier for you to be sensitive
[40:23] to the spirit because we are still
[40:26] fighting this guy yeah so he will come
[40:29] and bother the old nature will come but
[40:30] when you has inside sealed it's much
[40:33] easier it works out much the the way God
[40:37] wants it to work but if the holy spirit
[40:39] is still in the
[40:40] periphery if the holy spirit is still
[40:42] just in the in just inner the inner
[40:44] court is still around there you are a
[40:46] son of God but walk that Journey to the
[40:50] End I don't want to go deep
[40:53] now now let's go to verse seven
[40:58] because the caral mind is
[41:00] enmity against
[41:03] God for it is not subject to the law of
[41:06] God neither indeed can be
[41:10] right let's jump to verse 9 oh sorry
[41:13] verse 8 so they that are in the flesh
[41:15] cannot please
[41:17] God so I thought without faith you can't
[41:21] please
[41:23] God without If You In the Flesh that
[41:25] means you don't have the faith
[41:28] let's be careful okay let's be very
[41:30] careful on a this what I'm trying to
[41:32] talk to you tonight is about our
[41:34] daytoday walk it's about our minute to
[41:37] minute walk it's about our hour to hour
[41:40] walk our hour to hour thoughts our life
[41:44] you know when you've got when your life
[41:46] is centered around you you it does not
[41:48] Tire you or bother you to think about
[41:51] him every time in fact it becomes an
[41:54] experience when you walk and you say I
[41:56] wonder why what does my Lord think about
[41:58] this because you are in a relationship
[42:01] with him you are walking with him and
[42:04] you'll see as you grow in the Lord that
[42:06] the Lord makes things open for you you
[42:09] start to to communicate ah Lord I didn't
[42:11] know you this way in me in the olden
[42:14] days I never used to to to do something
[42:17] and think that if the Lord is willing I
[42:19] never right but nowadays when I don't
[42:23] know what makes that if you are led by
[42:25] the spirit he makes you to think hey I
[42:29] want to do that thing if the Lord is
[42:30] willing because he's always there he's
[42:33] he's very careful he he cannot afford to
[42:35] lose you he wants you every time to do
[42:38] things right when you think when you
[42:41] talk so being led by the spirit is a
[42:44] wonderful thing now let's talk about
[42:47] some few quotations then we go home but
[42:50] I just want to read a few more in inside
[42:53] this chapter I'll be just take a quote
[42:55] from Brother bam from the spoken word
[42:58] and then link it to a verse maybe inside
[43:01] this chapter otherwise if I just read
[43:03] the whole chapter now you may not be
[43:05] able to get as I get to a quote that I
[43:08] want to quote in the message oh yeah I
[43:11] forgot to also read for you Luke
[43:15] 2:25 this one is there's many in the
[43:19] Bible that we find these people that
[43:21] were led by the spirit but this
[43:24] particular one the way the man of God
[43:26] dramatizes him him about how he was led
[43:30] by the
[43:31] spirit the Holy Spirit promised him that
[43:34] you cannot die until you see the
[43:36] Messiah amen it's a beautiful story if
[43:39] you listen to how he dramatized and you
[43:42] know he was talking about how when Mary
[43:45] Mary Mary after burying the Lord then it
[43:48] was a custom for all the Jewish to take
[43:50] Jewish women to take their children to
[43:53] the temple to be circumcised on a
[43:56] certain day and also they will bring a
[43:58] sacrifice right if you don't have a
[44:00] sheep you'll just bring a ttle dove and
[44:02] then you ask your sacrifice and then
[44:04] maybe he'll say maybe it will been a
[44:05] beautiful morning on on that beautiful
[44:07] morning then all the human are going
[44:09] there who had children and then then
[44:12] maybe they queuing can you see them
[44:14] queuing and waiting for the priest you
[44:17] know and to to do their sacrifice and
[44:19] then as they come there there was this
[44:21] one little girl who was also just at the
[44:24] corner nobody wanted to be next to her
[44:26] because she had an illegitimate child
[44:29] soall nobody wanted to be next to her
[44:32] you know and then as they come along and
[44:34] and that priest came from the the Holy
[44:37] Spirit the Bible says as we read here
[44:41] luk
[44:44] says who can read it for me I like to
[44:47] engage people
[44:50] sorry what should I do
[44:57] I must say one two one
[45:01] two
[45:04] yeah who's going to read for
[45:06] me as you just keep it brother to read
[45:09] for
[45:11] me
[45:16] Jimmy right Luke 2:25 let's let's let's
[45:20] hear about this
[45:21] man again behold there was a man in
[45:24] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[45:27] man was just a devout waiting on the
[45:29] consolation of Israel and the Holy
[45:32] Spirit was upon Him ah the Holy Spirit
[45:35] was upon this man that is why the Holy
[45:38] Spirit could tell him go out and then he
[45:40] went out as he walk on the Queue and
[45:42] then he found this little girl who was
[45:44] holding the Messiah and then his eyes
[45:46] saw the Messiah he said Lord now I can
[45:48] die because my eyes have behold the
[45:51] Messiah so because he was he was led by
[45:54] the spirit he was led by the holy SP
[45:57] Spirit when you are led by the Holy
[45:58] Spirit people can think that you are not
[46:01] normal people will think that you are
[46:03] actually insane because actually in in
[46:07] the worldly way in the flesh way you
[46:10] are you are not normal you are up above
[46:13] normal not below above because the
[46:17] things that you do are not of the flesh
[46:19] you are led by the spirit you you are an
[46:22] old ball don't be surprised don't
[46:25] question why am I like this why people
[46:27] no no know who you are because you are
[46:30] an odd ball don't be surprised when you
[46:34] certain then you just don't find this
[46:36] world accept easy for you to live
[46:40] because you must know who you are so
[46:43] when you are led by the spirit you find
[46:45] that you you you you can do certain
[46:47] things that we don't what's wrong with
[46:49] Naomi no no if I can only know or be in
[46:52] the spirit of what what then I will know
[46:55] what Nai is doing what he's going
[46:57] through the people who are led by the
[46:58] spirit don't follow much about the
[47:02] things of the flesh they led by the
[47:05] spirit I'm going to read first quotation
[47:07] for you when the people take God at his
[47:10] word and believe his promise it is so
[47:13] Supernatural till it becomes crazy to
[47:16] the people of the world the people think
[47:18] that you are not okay so therefore we
[47:21] must not try to be okay no no we mustn't
[47:24] try to conform to be okay to adaptable
[47:28] to the world no no we just live
[47:30] according to the word of God let it
[47:32] break wherever it breaks huh so it so I
[47:37] won't read the whole thing but I just
[47:39] wanted to tell you that when you are led
[47:42] by God and you believe the promise of
[47:44] God you see a man and a woman can
[47:47] promise you
[47:49] something and then they make it sure
[47:52] that they promising you they even sign
[47:54] on the contract brother Callen and they
[47:56] promise prise you but it can happen that
[47:58] they can fail to fulfill their promise
[48:01] because they are human we are human
[48:04] being even governments politicians are
[48:07] even worse we normal people I can
[48:10] promise that sister Mike I'll come help
[48:12] you and I can fail to come help
[48:14] you you understand even if I promised
[48:17] then I phone and I apologize and expect
[48:19] you to understand even you a sister
[48:21] there then I don't come but that's human
[48:25] nature we fail
[48:27] but you see when God promises you he
[48:30] never
[48:31] fails when he says to you there is no
[48:35] more condemnation in other words you are
[48:37] not condemned under sin the law of sin
[48:40] anymore that's for real he means that
[48:44] and you see God is not a man that he can
[48:46] lie when whatever he says we take it raw
[48:50] as it is because what he said it must
[48:53] come to happen because he does not
[48:55] operate about the law of sin and death
[48:57] he operates according to the law of Life
[49:01] the law that says Let There Be and there
[49:04] is if he says i' I save you that's it
[49:08] brother no need for you to question to
[49:11] doubt to to to analyze it when he says
[49:14] I've saved you that's
[49:17] it I just you just take it like that and
[49:20] all you need to do you is to allow
[49:22] yourself to be led by
[49:24] him right because because if God can
[49:27] fail to fulfill this then then he's not
[49:31] God you see otherwise for God to be God
[49:35] everything that he says comes to pass am
[49:37] and he makes him God and that is above
[49:40] everything because no us we fail we say
[49:44] I come I fail I promise you brother KU
[49:47] that I'll come to eat your dinner I
[49:50] fail you see so we fail we human being
[49:53] and we fail also one we fail one another
[49:56] that is why the Lord said we must
[49:57] forgive one another because we fail one
[50:01] another we disappoint one another but
[50:03] but the people who are led by the spirit
[50:05] they find it easy to
[50:08] forgive they find it easy to forgive
[50:11] even without you asking
[50:13] them because he said people who are led
[50:15] by the spirit have got long suffering
[50:17] we'll read Galatians you'll hear about
[50:18] Galatians let's continue quote number
[50:23] two amen this this word of God Is Power
[50:27] powerful I like to stop here just a
[50:29] moment to say this if you make a oh this
[50:31] is what I told you if you make a promise
[50:33] I was just trying to paraphrase about
[50:36] that I'll jump this one so that we can
[50:38] save time but you heard me about when
[50:40] God promised oh yeah when God promis
[50:43] when he says I will heal you brother and
[50:46] sister he means that in fact when he
[50:49] says I have healed
[50:51] you just take it like
[50:54] that it's like how how can I explain
[50:57] this it's like you you just take it like
[51:01] that as is as it faith is so simple but
[51:05] many times we fail to get it because
[51:07] it's so easy but yet so powerful when is
[51:11] when Sister Jenny
[51:15] says yes come to my place and
[51:19] eat you won't go there and find she lock
[51:21] the door she's
[51:22] gone no you'll find her there right and
[51:26] we don't question that we just go that's
[51:29] EXA faith is like you just go to your
[51:32] car and start without even thinking that
[51:35] is faith that is capable enough to heal
[51:39] cancer that's as easy as that the
[51:42] problem is that our the law of Flesh
[51:45] complicates it to weaken our
[51:48] faith and it's so easy Lord you said
[51:51] you've heal I just I'm
[51:53] Healed I'm Healed don't make me think
[51:56] about he said I've healed you done
[51:59] because otherwise God is not a liar so
[52:01] what he said he said it all my duty is
[52:04] just to make sure that I am led by him I
[52:08] love him I I I because that's the first
[52:10] commandment with all my heart with all
[52:13] my soul and just follow what he says in
[52:15] his word and in in any way he said he'll
[52:17] walk with me he'll make my B and easy so
[52:20] why are Christians so tossed
[52:24] about why why does it appear as the
[52:26] world
[52:32] huh now I want to talk about
[52:36] mortifying
[52:37] yourself and now this will be linked to
[52:41] verse
[52:43] uh verse 13 of the chapter for if ye
[52:47] live after the flesh he shall
[52:49] die but if you you you you through the
[52:52] spirit you do motify the Deeds of the
[52:55] body shall live now I looked at this
[52:58] word motify amen it's not a day a a word
[53:03] that we use on a daily
[53:05] basis the
[53:07] root the root of the verb motify is from
[53:12] the Latin word
[53:15] mors which means
[53:18] death to motify something used to mean
[53:22] to destroy its life
[53:27] huh so that's the origin the origin of
[53:30] the word mortify so doesn't that take
[53:33] you back to that the flesh must
[53:36] die I must die to myself and let him
[53:40] live in me I must mortify now in in the
[53:43] modern day English it means you know
[53:45] when you em to embarrass to bring to
[53:48] shame the Deeds of the
[53:51] flesh to to disown
[53:55] them so let I just wanted to
[53:59] to to underline that
[54:01] word also the word surrender to full
[54:07] surrender to be led by the spirit you've
[54:09] got to be fully
[54:11] surrendered you don't want the Lord to
[54:13] lead you part-
[54:14] timely therefore I must not worship Him
[54:17] worship Him part Ely by the way all
[54:19] these things that I'm saying to you here
[54:21] brothers and sisters I'm actually
[54:23] wanting the Lord to tell me more
[54:27] yes yes because the minister is the
[54:30] first one sorry brother
[54:32] Ben know the pastor Pastor sitting
[54:35] behind you there that one is the pastor
[54:36] there if I say something wrong you talk
[54:38] to you now you see the minister is the
[54:41] first one to be led by the spirit
[54:44] imagine if I come here and I tell you to
[54:46] be to be led by the spirit but I didn't
[54:49] set myself aside
[54:51] prayerfully and seek God's ways without
[54:55] my analogy
[54:57] without saying Lord lead me take my
[54:59] mouth take everything aside let me speak
[55:02] only what you want then how can I help
[55:06] you to show you to be led by the spirit
[55:09] you understand so we have got a big
[55:16] task ministers I think theyard me
[55:20] because I'm one of them and quote number
[55:24] three so if God was so pleased with
[55:26] Christ till he act he accepted him and
[55:29] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[55:31] pleased and through Christ being the
[55:34] perfect
[55:36] one as dead to our own thoughts and
[55:39] ideas being born of the spirit of God
[55:41] walking not after the theology but after
[55:44] the spirit inside
[55:46] us then let the dead in Christ walk not
[55:52] after the things of the world but after
[55:54] the things of the spirit
[55:56] so this spirit is inside us so we learn
[56:00] to hear him we learn to talk to him we
[56:04] we learn over
[56:06] time as you pray as you get as that
[56:09] little button grows grows grows you say
[56:13] wow you see things better you talk to
[56:15] him better you are you are careful about
[56:18] him because he's careful about you you
[56:20] you worry about what the Lord how the
[56:22] Lord will take this you worry about my
[56:26] ah the way that I spoke to my sister it
[56:28] was not right ah the way that I I was
[56:31] thinking about that thing is not right
[56:34] because you're sensitive we'll get to
[56:36] the point now of being sensitive to the
[56:38] spirit see you are you your inside of
[56:41] Christ
[56:43] walking then all the things of the world
[56:45] pass away the great then all the GES
[56:49] that you had of this thing and of that
[56:52] thing is all vanished away and your
[56:55] heart and mind becomes
[56:57] singular on Christ Jesus that shows you
[57:01] have died to yourself and born
[57:05] again you see so don't be like I like
[57:09] what brother Greg said on Sunday he said
[57:12] he said the Queen the the sin question
[57:15] is
[57:16] done we are talking about the working
[57:18] now the journey that sin question the
[57:20] devil mustn't bring to you the devil
[57:22] must never come to you and threaten you
[57:23] about things that you did in
[57:25] 1909 that's right no the sin question is
[57:28] settled
[57:30] D all what is left now is the daily walk
[57:34] and even that just like the sin question
[57:36] was sorted even the walk it will come to
[57:39] Perfection one of these days that is why
[57:41] we come to church that is why we we read
[57:43] the sermons that we preached in 1960
[57:45] that is why we read the Bible that was
[57:47] preaching in ad m m you see because we
[57:52] these things are there to remind us to
[57:55] to to make make sure that our button is
[57:58] growing is growing is growing before you
[58:00] know it one of these days we Rapture and
[58:03] go home just take heat to what he says
[58:06] he's there not even a preacher can bring
[58:10] him to you you and him is that
[58:13] relationship with him it is your
[58:15] personal duty to be a friend to
[58:20] Jesus a close
[58:23] friend dying to ourselves quick code
[58:26] number four I I wrote here brother and
[58:29] sister so many people laugh about
[58:31] baptism of the holy spirit it's only
[58:33] thing that that will save you that's the
[58:35] only thing that will save you not not
[58:38] another thing God has no other way
[58:42] provided but for me for men and women to
[58:45] be filled with the Holy Spirit and be
[58:48] led by the Holy Spirit correctly that's
[58:52] what he says here you see so the issue
[58:55] of being led by the spirit and being
[58:56] filled is so
[58:59] important is something that I would
[59:01] imagine on your daily tasks if you
[59:05] haven't received it it must be a a
[59:08] something that that is burning in your
[59:11] heart I want to baptism of the Holy
[59:13] Ghost and be sure that you have
[59:17] it and I don't believe that this a that
[59:22] we are you know we get different
[59:24] experiences we get
[59:26] I cannot explain to you how how is
[59:30] what's going to happen when he come and
[59:32] you experience him because he he make
[59:34] himself available he make himself he
[59:37] give you the experience and he anoint
[59:38] you in a unique special way each one has
[59:41] got a story or let me say a testimony of
[59:45] how because it's a personal relationship
[59:48] how can it be like mine when when when
[59:50] when it's a personal relationship it's a
[59:52] personal it's Unique because each one of
[59:55] us if there's this this level of
[59:56] speciality is special like this way like
[59:58] this before him there's no one who's no
[1:00:00] special and lesser special to him we are
[1:00:03] equally special and that's why the Lord
[1:00:05] showed us even through you know the
[1:00:08] fingerprints no one is got same
[1:00:10] fingerprints like you he took careful
[1:00:13] consideration to make you and the and
[1:00:17] that thing in the what do they call it
[1:00:19] the retina or
[1:00:20] what the retina oh sorry my my accent
[1:00:25] the retin
[1:00:28] now they ident he can identify you
[1:00:30] because no one has called one like yours
[1:00:33] so God is so careful and these things of
[1:00:35] the flesh are basically just trying to
[1:00:37] show you that hey he he made you you are
[1:00:41] so special to him that he even want his
[1:00:45] experience you and
[1:00:47] him that's why when he he said I'll find
[1:00:50] you in there on the third pool no one
[1:00:53] can teach you or tell tell you how that
[1:00:57] I'll find you in the experience is maybe
[1:01:00] one day the pastor will teach us about
[1:01:02] the let's meet up in the experience then
[1:01:05] you go and experience yours but it's not
[1:01:07] something it's it's a special spe but
[1:01:10] you must have
[1:01:13] it amen we're going to close now I check
[1:01:18] time because when there's visitors I
[1:01:21] know you can finish
[1:01:24] late now
[1:01:26] the work of the spirit there's works of
[1:01:29] the spirit and there's work of the
[1:01:33] flesh I know you don't do all those
[1:01:35] things of the work of the flesh it's the
[1:01:37] devil who can make you and me to be
[1:01:41] tricked into them some of them are just
[1:01:44] horrible and then let I just I want to
[1:01:47] read and bring a thought to you I want
[1:01:48] to read read it and then bring a thought
[1:01:50] to you Galatians 5 if it's possible
[1:01:54] sister um Talia you can display it if
[1:01:56] it's
[1:02:00] possible H I'll start from verse 16 Mel
[1:02:04] 5 ver 16
[1:02:08] Galatians there right this is I then
[1:02:11] walk in the spirit walk in the spirit
[1:02:14] this is like an instruction walk in the
[1:02:16] spirit there's no jokes here when when
[1:02:19] when when the prophet saw the bride an
[1:02:21] overview of the Bride marching going he
[1:02:23] said I saw them of different nations and
[1:02:25] were of different colors and of
[1:02:27] different things and then at the end
[1:02:28] there towards the tail there there were
[1:02:30] some that went almost out of Step I said
[1:02:32] walk in
[1:02:34] line so it's an
[1:02:36] instruction you can't be a son and
[1:02:38] daughter of God and don't want to take
[1:02:39] instruction walk in line so walk in the
[1:02:41] spirit I'm not he's not asking you walk
[1:02:45] in the spirit you are a son of God you
[1:02:48] are a daughter of God don't don't mix
[1:02:50] the two don't
[1:02:51] confuse serious every day that's what it
[1:02:54] means every minute in
[1:02:57] it he says walk in the spirit and he
[1:02:59] shall not fulfill the last of the flesh
[1:03:02] for the flesh lth against the spirit and
[1:03:04] the spirit against the flesh these are
[1:03:07] contrary the one to the other so that
[1:03:10] you cannot do the things that he
[1:03:14] would but if he be led of the spirit you
[1:03:18] are not under the law that law of the
[1:03:21] flesh right now the works of the flesh
[1:03:24] are manifest which are this now listen
[1:03:26] to this these are the works of the flesh
[1:03:30] adultery fornication uncleanliness
[1:03:33] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[1:03:36] hatred VAR variance
[1:03:41] ulations wroth Strife seditions heresies
[1:03:46] envyings murderers I mean murders
[1:03:49] drunkness revealings such and such like
[1:03:53] now what Paul is telling you here
[1:03:58] of which I tell you before okay let me
[1:04:01] stop there you see this things that Paul
[1:04:03] wrote here that that list doesn't end
[1:04:05] there that is why he says and such like
[1:04:08] there are these are some of the strong
[1:04:10] ones but there are some that are not so
[1:04:13] strong the cousins of these ones the
[1:04:15] cousins and sisters and brothers demons
[1:04:18] are related they've got their cousins
[1:04:21] they skillful in different things and
[1:04:23] they help one another and some of them
[1:04:26] you can't one day I was talking to a
[1:04:27] brother he said Hey Brother the Lord
[1:04:29] revealed to me as I was praying I found
[1:04:31] that I had 45
[1:04:35] demons that were attacking me that I
[1:04:38] need to deal with and I asked him can
[1:04:40] you tell me some of them what are those
[1:04:43] you can't believe some of the
[1:04:46] Demons things that we many times we just
[1:04:50] take like a light and and don't think
[1:04:52] that it's a this is a demon because why
[1:04:56] it comes disguised because it's a cousin
[1:04:59] of the cousin of the cousin of
[1:05:03] Envy is
[1:05:05] related but you know when he related
[1:05:09] down the line then you don't suspect it
[1:05:11] and it comes disguised so demons are
[1:05:13] like that right so we need to be know
[1:05:17] aware that this things that Paul read
[1:05:20] here we don't just say I don't do that
[1:05:23] that that that that that I'm good you
[1:05:24] must watch out and pray to be led by the
[1:05:27] spirit so that any of those and such
[1:05:30] like related to
[1:05:32] them how can how can how many demons did
[1:05:35] Legion
[1:05:38] have how can so many spirits be in one
[1:05:42] man and we hear that now in the days
[1:05:45] that we are living in 250 million were
[1:05:48] released from the river
[1:05:49] Euphrates and they
[1:05:54] here no wonder the people people don't
[1:05:55] want to pray every day no wonder people
[1:05:58] want to make other things idols and we
[1:06:01] want to make to we just feel tired and
[1:06:03] lazy do you think it's not a demon
[1:06:04] making you like
[1:06:06] that and we you just want you just oh I
[1:06:08] just I'm not I'm not feeling I'm just
[1:06:11] feeling
[1:06:12] upset what's that there an evil spirit
[1:06:16] around there you cast it and and you
[1:06:19] jump before you know it you're out of
[1:06:20] that that that we are supposed to
[1:06:23] dominate The Devil he's notos to
[1:06:25] dominate us oh no no I just I don't I
[1:06:28] don't I don't feel her I don't like
[1:06:31] her I don't know
[1:06:34] why that's a
[1:06:39] demo you just feel like ah you want to
[1:06:42] be extra
[1:06:45] beautiful I'm not saying it's wrong but
[1:06:48] check the spirit remember in as much as
[1:06:50] you must be led by the spirit of God and
[1:06:53] be sensitive you must also brother
[1:06:56] here I'll read for you he says also you
[1:06:58] must be sensitive and careful of the
[1:07:01] evil spirits and know how they operate
[1:07:04] and their
[1:07:05] moves you see you cannot just just just
[1:07:10] talk to the sister of a child of God in
[1:07:13] a certain way and you call yourself a
[1:07:15] brother maybe there could be and some
[1:07:19] some Spirit don't even want you to know
[1:07:20] that they
[1:07:22] there they hiding because they want to
[1:07:25] get them hibernate lay X later on
[1:07:29] hch that's how the devil work he was he
[1:07:32] a bad news guy the devil that all these
[1:07:36] ones that Paul spoke that's why Paul
[1:07:37] says and such
[1:07:39] like so God has made these things open
[1:07:43] and clear to us but most importantly the
[1:07:45] Holy Spirit once he's there he's going
[1:07:48] to just reveal show you with all these
[1:07:52] gifts and things that he gave to us but
[1:07:55] let's finish this
[1:07:58] scripture because really I can't just
[1:08:00] read just the The Works of the Flesh and
[1:08:02] leave it there let's hear the the works
[1:08:05] of the spirit of
[1:08:12] God oh yeah anding so I ended up there
[1:08:16] that um of of of the which I tell you
[1:08:19] before as I have also told you in the
[1:08:23] time past that they which do such things
[1:08:26] shall not inherit the kingdom of God and
[1:08:28] the devil know that Paul told you and he
[1:08:30] knows that you're going to watch for
[1:08:32] those things so he'll bring those
[1:08:33] cousins he'll bring those hidden ones
[1:08:35] those subtle demons I don't think and I
[1:08:39] didn't plan to say this but I don't
[1:08:41] think
[1:08:42] serpent went to
[1:08:44] Eve's house
[1:08:47] once no I think he was coming every day
[1:08:50] for coffee even when Adam was there
[1:08:52] until Adam used got used to him and ah
[1:08:55] this is the guy is a local guy and even
[1:08:58] when Adam was going out and Satan coming
[1:09:00] in he said oh no no I'll see you now I'm
[1:09:02] just going to do something I'll be back
[1:09:03] soon because he he said you know he was
[1:09:07] a he was he wanted to make himself a
[1:09:09] family
[1:09:10] friend I think he was coming every day
[1:09:13] that is why it was so easy to deceive
[1:09:16] Eve so be very careful about the
[1:09:20] familiar spirits that want to at and
[1:09:22] make you get used to them until you
[1:09:25] can't see your eyes can't see your
[1:09:28] reasoning can't understand that this is
[1:09:31] wrong let's be careful about those that
[1:09:34] wants to make themselves your family
[1:09:37] friends be very careful they want to
[1:09:40] come in this family and make themselves
[1:09:44] comfortable until you they use you to
[1:09:46] defend them and say no no this is right
[1:09:49] this is what did the prophet say that
[1:09:52] but how can I teach you sister brother
[1:09:54] you get let the spirit of God make sure
[1:09:57] you that is why it's so important that's
[1:09:59] the point number
[1:10:02] one to make sure you have let's read
[1:10:05] about we hear that those ones you can't
[1:10:08] inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit
[1:10:10] of the spirit is love
[1:10:13] love joy peace
[1:10:17] longsuffering longsuffering meaning I
[1:10:20] must be patient with my brother even if
[1:10:24] he's doing something wrong to to
[1:10:26] me I I must be patient with people of
[1:10:29] the Holy Spirit are not
[1:10:31] normal we are above
[1:10:38] normal
[1:10:40] gentleness
[1:10:42] gentle goodness Faith weekness
[1:10:48] Temperance against such there's no law
[1:10:50] and I don't think this list is
[1:10:53] exhaustive it's not
[1:10:56] the things the holy spirit will make you
[1:10:58] do things that will say ah Christine
[1:11:00] you because it's the Holy
[1:11:03] Spirit I can tell you now I can converse
[1:11:06] there certain things that when brother
[1:11:07] Ben does I think ah this brother because
[1:11:09] he's led by the spirit of
[1:11:12] God only people who are led by the
[1:11:14] spirit will behave like this brother
[1:11:16] that's why I live I love him sorry
[1:11:18] brother been to put on the
[1:11:21] spot who else can I give an example he's
[1:11:23] our Shepherd so he'll be on the pedestal
[1:11:28] sometimes follow me as I follow
[1:11:31] Christ amen so and they that are Christ
[1:11:36] have crucified the flesh with the
[1:11:39] affections and lust and if we live in
[1:11:42] the spirit if we live in the spirit let
[1:11:46] us also
[1:11:49] walk it's not a
[1:11:51] static settlement we walk because we are
[1:11:54] in a Journey so we walk Walking it mean
[1:11:57] that we are walking together when we are
[1:12:00] walking me and the spirit is in me and
[1:12:03] then I'm in him then we engage we talk
[1:12:06] we know we talk about things about my
[1:12:09] life and he tells me how Heaven is going
[1:12:12] to be that ah he even tells you that
[1:12:14] your ears and your eyes cannot
[1:12:16] understand but wait and
[1:12:17] see and then I I talk to him then I tell
[1:12:21] him I miss to go home and then we talk
[1:12:23] about that when you know
[1:12:25] another singer says you know me and the
[1:12:28] Lord had a talk about
[1:12:30] you then then then the Holy Spirit even
[1:12:33] bring words that you never thought and
[1:12:35] the Holy Spirit goes and and because
[1:12:37] he's careful about our infirmities also
[1:12:40] the Holy Spirit when he's leading you
[1:12:42] he's also careful about the things of
[1:12:44] the Flesh on your body your sickness is
[1:12:46] that you don't even know yourself when
[1:12:48] he he prays when he intercede for you he
[1:12:51] tells the Lord about those sicknesses
[1:12:53] that you don't know that are your body
[1:12:56] about some problems that you don't know
[1:12:59] that are waiting for you the Holy Spirit
[1:13:01] enter that's what happens when you walk
[1:13:03] and you are led by him he intercedes for
[1:13:06] you my wife was telling me about an
[1:13:08] accident an accident that happened last
[1:13:11] week it happened just just few seconds
[1:13:14] before
[1:13:16] them you saw it and it so because the
[1:13:20] the holy spirit is careful and even if
[1:13:23] we are careless
[1:13:25] he's still
[1:13:27] careful let's just not offend him and
[1:13:30] the only way not to in our caral flesh
[1:13:33] we can't make it is to allow him to come
[1:13:37] that's going to give us the ability or
[1:13:38] the way to be sensitive to him to be
[1:13:41] careful to be led by him it's not
[1:13:44] something that you can make yourself to
[1:13:46] do no in your ability as a human being I
[1:13:49] can't but him but allow him fully open
[1:13:53] open and then he comes fully fleshed and
[1:13:56] seal you you tell me the man it change
[1:14:00] the whole character of a man the the way
[1:14:03] you know brother let's say you know him
[1:14:05] as a talkative man he he suddenly not
[1:14:08] not like that why because something
[1:14:10] happened to
[1:14:12] you I don't know if I'll be able to be
[1:14:17] quiet
[1:14:19] lastly I wanted just to close with this
[1:14:22] one about you know the story when
[1:14:23] brother bham was there in Memphis
[1:14:26] about
[1:14:28] anima how can you the holy the the
[1:14:32] prophet said no he was they landed there
[1:14:34] and then he says
[1:14:36] H this is the middle of the story I'll
[1:14:39] paraphrase it because you know the story
[1:14:41] but what I want to tell you is that
[1:14:43] there was no vision that came to him he
[1:14:46] didn't see any Vision he didn't see the
[1:14:49] angel come to
[1:14:51] him he was just going to post the
[1:14:54] letters
[1:14:55] and then something things that turn back
[1:14:58] go that way and he thought he's hearing
[1:15:03] things it was and it was not an audible
[1:15:05] voice like hey David how are you no so
[1:15:10] now but the thing is this he
[1:15:14] obeyed he allowed himself to
[1:15:17] follow if someone stopped him and asked
[1:15:20] him what do you think he was going to
[1:15:21] say is that are you okay no no something
[1:15:24] said I must go this way
[1:15:26] 10 then he actually stopped some point
[1:15:29] wanted to no no go that way and but how
[1:15:33] can you explain
[1:15:37] that then he found the sister who had a
[1:15:41] vision a dream and prayed for that boy
[1:15:44] and he got
[1:15:46] healed and so when you are led by the
[1:15:49] spirit you must be sensitive to the
[1:15:53] spirit and ask the Lord Lord am I make
[1:15:56] me to be sensitive to the spirit to you
[1:15:59] when you talk so that I can hear you
[1:16:02] with that word that is not an audible
[1:16:05] voice because lord it's no argument that
[1:16:08] I'm your son so I would like to be
[1:16:10] sensitive to you when he's that's that's
[1:16:13] why I brought this quotation but I
[1:16:14] wanted just to summarize it because my
[1:16:17] time has run out so brothers and sisters
[1:16:21] lastly he says now we realize and
[1:16:23] everyone knows there are are
[1:16:26] spirits then if they there Spirits then
[1:16:30] there's bound to be a master of the
[1:16:33] spirit because it changes the nature of
[1:16:36] Sinners into Christians and they is
[1:16:39] bound to be the master the head there
[1:16:42] somewhere and that's God there's many
[1:16:45] spirits be very careful be very
[1:16:48] sensitive so be
[1:16:50] aware in our own capacity we can do it
[1:16:54] amen so
[1:16:55] I trust that
[1:16:57] I've blessed you with this few words and
[1:17:01] then you can go and read this poen
