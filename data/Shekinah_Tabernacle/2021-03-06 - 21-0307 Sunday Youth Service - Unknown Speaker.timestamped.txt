[14:54] kiera joshua it's for you all of you
[14:57] individual not for all of you for you
[15:01] so let's start talking to the lord this
[15:04] is david
[15:05] in psalm 19 verse 24 to 37 he says thy
[15:08] testimony are
[15:10] also are my delight and my counselors
[15:14] my soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken
[15:18] thou me according to thy word
[15:20] quicken thou me according to thy word
[15:24] i have declared my ways and thou
[15:27] heardest me teach me thy statutes
[15:32] see that's going and then he says
[15:36] make me understand the way of thy
[15:38] precepts
[15:41] so shall i so shall i
[15:44] talk thy wondrous works of thy wondrous
[15:46] works my soul melted for heaviness
[15:49] strengthen thou me according unto thy
[15:52] word it's again
[15:53] unto thy word remove from me
[15:56] the way of lying and grant me the law of
[16:01] grace
[16:02] of graciously die lord graciously i have
[16:05] chosen the way of truth
[16:07] thy judgments have i laid before me
[16:11] so you may be seated so i don't want you
[16:13] to stand so long
[16:15] he goes on to say and he says i
[16:18] have stuck i have stuck unto
[16:22] thy testimonies oh lord now remember the
[16:24] word testimony i want you to concentrate
[16:26] on this word
[16:27] does this thing have a pointer
[16:29] testimonies
[16:30] okay i want you to focus about testimony
[16:33] because there's going to come apart
[16:34] in your life a place in your life if you
[16:37] choose life or death if you choose
[16:39] god or satan if you choose the world or
[16:42] heaven
[16:43] what you choose you're one day
[16:46] going to be called for a testimony
[16:50] here on earth and in heaven
[16:54] think about it here on earth
[16:57] and in heaven and i'll explain myself
[17:00] now in due time
[17:01] i will run the way of thy commandments
[17:04] when thou shalt enlarge my heart teach
[17:07] me o lord the way of thy statutes
[17:10] and i will keep i shall keep it unto the
[17:13] end
[17:14] give me understanding and i shall keep
[17:16] thy law yea
[17:17] i shall observe it with my whole heart
[17:20] so david
[17:22] is having a one-on-one year with the
[17:23] lord so david is not just happy with a
[17:26] normal everyday walk
[17:28] he wants to talk to the lord every day
[17:31] personally
[17:32] the mighty king david that went through
[17:34] so many things
[17:36] is saying to the lord i see
[17:40] i i i not we
[17:44] not us not them but i
[17:47] so meaning that this walk is a very very
[17:50] very personal walk between you
[17:53] and god no one else's revelation
[17:57] no one else's teaching no one else's
[17:59] vision
[18:00] no one else's thoughts could change you
[18:03] from what
[18:04] you and god are talking about
[18:08] i might not know what's going on in
[18:10] mormo's life but god does know because
[18:12] every day when more more
[18:14] thinks god listens and now brother
[18:17] brother isaac come and preaches
[18:19] surveillance man what a sermon but
[18:21] see even if you talk inside of your
[18:24] heart even if you speak to god here
[18:26] no matter what you say even if you say i
[18:28] don't understand i don't think
[18:30] it's not clear everything you say in
[18:32] here god
[18:33] hears god sees and is going to help you
[18:36] to get where you need to go because he's
[18:38] not a god of
[18:41] confusion okay if i'm going to i'm going
[18:43] to go like brother
[18:45] and call you out if you are not
[18:47] listening hey
[18:49] okay so i think i'll skip these but go
[18:52] read some
[18:53] to go go read this song this is a
[18:54] wonderful song because what happens is
[18:56] it basically psalm 119 is a big psalm
[18:59] but when you go from verse 24
[19:01] and you go all the way to the end and
[19:03] the year where i am is 30
[19:06] yeah here 37 so let's get that one up he
[19:10] says
[19:11] make me to go in the path of thy
[19:13] commandments
[19:15] for therein do i delight incline my
[19:18] heart
[19:18] unto thy testimonies their testimonies
[19:21] again
[19:22] and not to covetness turn away
[19:25] mine eyes from beholding vanity
[19:29] okay so be holding things that that will
[19:32] will go away
[19:32] without self-image anything in the world
[19:34] anything that will exalt you above the
[19:36] word of god
[19:37] turn my eyes away from those things i
[19:39] want to be in your word
[19:41] and quicken and thou me in thy way
[19:45] so we're going to talk about mr jonah
[19:49] mr jonah he's not here
[19:52] so i'm saying you're going to be called
[19:55] out on your testimony david is asking
[19:57] lord keep me in thy testimony not just
[20:00] mine
[20:00] but thy testimony so we've got jonah
[20:03] jonah god goes to john he says
[20:06] now the word of the lord came to jonah
[20:08] the son of
[20:09] amitai saying arise go to nineveh
[20:13] that great city and cry against it
[20:16] for their wickedness has come up before
[20:19] me
[20:20] so i'm watching i've got my i've got my
[20:24] eye upon them
[20:25] and they're getting wicked same with
[20:26] sodom and gomorrah this morning see what
[20:28] i'm talking about the preaching over the
[20:30] pulpit see what's happening god is
[20:31] trying to warn all of us
[20:33] big and small that there's coming a time
[20:36] where we get to a place where the
[20:38] wickedness of this
[20:39] world is irking god and he repents that
[20:43] he made man
[20:45] but he never just punishes he first
[20:48] warns but now he says you go
[20:52] and you go warn them mr noah
[20:55] you gonna jonah you're gonna go and warn
[20:58] them
[20:58] please go warn them now
[21:02] how many of you have been called to be a
[21:04] witness
[21:08] how many
[21:13] can i see some ants amen all of you
[21:16] sitting here is accountable that you are
[21:18] a witness
[21:19] why because you're not sitting here with
[21:22] no
[21:23] accident god didn't call you here to
[21:26] this sermon this church and this
[21:27] fellowship and this wendy wellington
[21:30] just to fade away he called you for a
[21:32] witness
[21:33] because there are wicked people out
[21:35] there
[21:36] that needs to hear god's wrath is going
[21:39] to pour out
[21:40] upon this world and they might not even
[21:42] know about it
[21:44] but somebody has to say it somebody's
[21:46] going to go out
[21:47] so there you are in your school there
[21:50] you are in your workplace
[21:52] there you are in your church people
[21:55] walking away from church
[21:58] how many youth do we have in this church
[22:00] i don't see them all here
[22:04] who's the witness
[22:09] who's the witness so if we all just stay
[22:12] away what's going to happen to the
[22:14] kingdom of god if we all just give up
[22:17] who's going to warn these people
[22:20] because if you look at the story of
[22:22] jonah and we'll get there but the
[22:23] there's a wonderful part in the story
[22:26] where god goes and shows the prophet and
[22:28] says
[22:28] i need to send you because these people
[22:30] wanted to repent
[22:33] i knew their hearts though i grieved me
[22:35] and they were wicked
[22:36] and i was going to punish them and
[22:37] destroy them i know that if
[22:40] i send you i send you jonah
[22:43] the way you will preach the word of god
[22:45] the way you would live it
[22:47] was going to get them to repent and then
[22:49] i will give them grace
[22:52] but see jonah no man he was in a little
[22:55] bit of a world of his own
[22:56] he says but jonah rose up and flee
[23:00] he ran away a prophet called by god
[23:03] flee unto tarshish from the presence of
[23:05] the lord
[23:08] he didn't even want to have nothing to
[23:09] do with it
[23:11] so god calls him and says hey here you
[23:13] are in wellington
[23:15] here you are as a witness for me in this
[23:16] end time brother
[23:18] isaac is preaching time is no more it's
[23:21] later than we think
[23:22] and i need you to go get the last ones
[23:25] but what are we doing we flee because
[23:29] the world is so nice natasha's for me
[23:31] is just driftwood darstars is for me is
[23:34] a place of
[23:35] safety where you can do just what you
[23:38] want
[23:40] because you're a christian and you're
[23:42] saved tarshish for me
[23:44] is a place where you can go where you
[23:45] feel safe because you're in your comfort
[23:48] zone that's darsha's
[23:50] so when when jonah was asked to go
[23:53] he just fled into his comfort zone
[23:55] because then i don't have to talk about
[23:57] god
[23:57] i don't have to stand in front of
[23:59] friends that says there's no god
[24:01] i don't know have to be in a workplace
[24:03] where everybody walked past me
[24:04] uses the name of the lord in vain i
[24:06] don't have to share a testimony back to
[24:08] someone to say hey
[24:10] but wait there is a heaven and a hell
[24:14] no tarshish is a place where i can just
[24:16] fade away into the background
[24:18] and nothing ever happened don't worry oh
[24:21] he's a christian but he's nice because
[24:23] he he never says it as it is
[24:25] he hides it all he just sweeps it under
[24:27] the carpet he's one of us
[24:28] i ain't one of this world i am not
[24:32] come to this world to be one of this
[24:33] world i am a witness and a testimony and
[24:36] i want you to realize at a very young
[24:38] age
[24:38] you will always be tested on your
[24:41] testimony
[24:43] satan is always going to call you out
[24:46] when you least expect it
[24:47] when you're having the most fun or when
[24:49] you're at the lowest point in your walk
[24:51] with god
[24:52] satan is going to come and say are you a
[24:54] christian
[24:55] and it's usually the people the closest
[24:57] to you that hurts you the most
[24:59] so i'll rather prepare you for it and
[25:01] know that when this comes
[25:03] god will put the words in your mouth but
[25:04] are you willing to speak those words
[25:08] or do you just run to tarsus
[25:13] come on it's easy to run to tasha's
[25:17] it's easy to keep quiet when your friend
[25:19] says no let's just do this rather than
[25:21] go to church
[25:22] or let's just do this rather to go to
[25:23] the next youth event oh i just couldn't
[25:25] be bothered i'd rather stay at home
[25:28] who is those people and why are we
[25:31] as christians happy with that conduct
[25:34] who is standing at that time for the
[25:36] lord and saying no you know what
[25:38] i will still go because i'm a christian
[25:41] we need that
[25:43] god needs it because remember you're not
[25:45] representing
[25:46] you're not representing just hannah
[25:48] you're not representing
[25:50] momo as momo or armantazar you are
[25:53] representing the kingdom of god
[25:56] so when you stand you you're a
[25:57] representative of god
[26:00] first before you are mad
[26:04] because every prophet that spoke through
[26:06] every age had a name
[26:09] every prophet had a name but god had to
[26:10] call them first before their name was
[26:12] made known as a prophet and had to
[26:14] vindicate them
[26:15] so you never know when god says to you
[26:17] to say something if you keep quiet you
[26:19] get in trouble
[26:20] no i don't want to go too far away but
[26:22] look now
[26:23] this man this prophet loving god
[26:26] believing in god runs from the presence
[26:28] of the lord
[26:29] and he went down to joppa and he found
[26:30] the ship going to tarshish and he
[26:32] paid them he paid the ship to take him
[26:35] away
[26:37] away from the presence of god this is
[26:38] how this world is we pay
[26:40] games we pay movies we pay everything
[26:43] out there to get us away from the
[26:44] presence of god
[26:46] we pay for entertainment the biggest
[26:49] commodity today is entertainment data
[26:52] internet all the faults you see there
[26:54] people pay to have that on their phones
[26:57] they pay to go to a place where they're
[26:59] comfortable
[27:00] it's the same it's the same no i'm not
[27:04] i'm not just fighting but i need to lay
[27:06] something here so that we realize is
[27:08] this is a time
[27:09] where there's life and death there is a
[27:11] time where there comes that decision
[27:13] what you're going to do
[27:15] and unfortunately being a dad i see that
[27:18] time for my sons coming closer
[27:20] and closer and closer and the older
[27:22] they're getting and the older you're
[27:23] getting the more you're gonna fight
[27:25] these battles and it's gonna happen
[27:28] but i'll rather have you being ready for
[27:30] the devil when he has a punch
[27:32] then just get knocked out the first time
[27:34] right because i got knocked out
[27:36] i come from the world and i still today
[27:39] pick up pieces that i got knocked out
[27:40] because nobody told me this
[27:43] like that man that brother isaac
[27:45] preached about what came to heaven and
[27:46] he says i was a good person
[27:48] but when his life started being
[27:49] displayed on that big tv
[27:51] he couldn't hide anything now i don't
[27:53] want us to be there
[27:55] that's my job okay
[27:59] jonah so now here comes the testimony
[28:01] pod remember i said hold on to this
[28:03] testimony part
[28:06] here it says so now he's on the boat
[28:09] storm breaks up
[28:11] we all know the story big storm breaks
[28:12] up and these guys are get together and
[28:14] they go
[28:15] in the in the story it says and they
[28:17] each one pray to their own god
[28:19] that's what it says there in the story
[28:21] just before we get here and he says
[28:23] and then they said unto him because they
[28:25] now caught him he was sleeping in the
[28:26] boat
[28:27] because he's a christian so he doesn't
[28:29] care about a storm okay
[28:30] because he knows god is in control of
[28:33] everything
[28:33] though he's still running away from god
[28:35] he was fast asleep in the boat
[28:38] he says and then they called wake him up
[28:40] and say please pray unto your lord he
[28:42] says and then they said unto him tell us
[28:43] we pray thee
[28:44] now here comes it for what cause
[28:48] this evil is upon us what is thine
[28:50] occupation
[28:53] what are you where have thou cometh from
[28:57] what is thy country and of what people
[29:00] are thou
[29:01] yeah so they ask you
[29:04] so who are you who are you
[29:07] you come here into down there and come
[29:09] and work here and do those things but
[29:11] who are you
[29:12] who told you to come and be awful
[29:14] righteousness in here who are you
[29:17] who says this is wrong who says gays and
[29:19] lesbians and those things are wrong who
[29:20] are you to say it
[29:22] this is what they do because you're
[29:24] rocking the boat when you come as a
[29:25] christian into a workplace
[29:27] and you stand for the truth then they
[29:29] want to know who are you
[29:30] why do you not play games there's
[29:32] nothing wrong with games
[29:35] huh why don't you watch all these filthy
[29:37] stuff on the internet
[29:39] or all the stories why don't you know
[29:40] the newest superhero story
[29:42] avengers plus -17 or whatever
[29:46] why don't you know it because i don't
[29:49] look at it
[29:51] but they're going to ask you out on it
[29:54] now
[29:54] here he comes and he said to them i'm a
[29:57] hebrew
[29:58] and i say to them i'm a christian
[30:01] i don't do those things i don't believe
[30:05] it's right because the bible says it's
[30:07] not right
[30:09] fear and he says and i fear the lord
[30:14] and the god of heaven which have made
[30:16] the sea
[30:17] and the dry land that's his testimony
[30:22] then were the men exceedingly afraid and
[30:25] said unto them
[30:26] why has thou done this for the men
[30:29] knew that he fled from the presence of
[30:31] the lord because
[30:33] he had told them so
[30:36] jonah on the boat had to come clean and
[30:38] go boys you know what
[30:41] i got it wrong god said i have to go
[30:44] here and i decide i'll go here and now
[30:46] the storm is upon your boat and you're
[30:48] all gonna die
[30:49] pretty much if you don't throw me over
[30:51] the side
[30:53] and they go these people they go we
[30:55] can't throw you over the side we don't
[30:56] want
[30:57] your blood on our hands he goes but
[31:00] god said you have to do it it's thus say
[31:03] of the lord
[31:04] so he has to go over the side and the
[31:06] moment they threw him over the side of
[31:08] the boat
[31:09] everything went gone and then they were
[31:12] exceedingly afraid
[31:15] so now i'm asking you when the boat is
[31:17] wrong
[31:18] and people ask your testimony and you
[31:20] say but i'm a christian
[31:22] i don't do these things brother muppo
[31:24] said it so nicely
[31:25] my feet will not let me go into this
[31:27] place
[31:28] he'll just turn around right here and go
[31:30] this way but my feet cannot let me go
[31:32] into a bar because they got designed
[31:36] from heaven to go in there
[31:39] but it's not him it's his feet his
[31:42] feet's telling him he's walking there
[31:44] and he goes no i can't do this and then
[31:46] i just walk this way
[31:48] and then the guy goes but why don't you
[31:49] do it this is because i'm a christian
[31:51] so he comes to a place where he has to
[31:53] share his testimony with someone
[31:56] because the people like it or not the
[31:58] world is watching you
[31:59] they're watching you so close not
[32:01] because they want you to slip
[32:03] up but they want to see if this rapture
[32:05] is real now think about it
[32:07] one moment they see you one moment you
[32:10] got
[32:12] okay
[32:14] because it will be a twinkling of the
[32:15] eye and you'll be gone
[32:18] and all the 20 years you've been
[32:20] spending in that company working for
[32:22] them
[32:22] every time you've been saying the
[32:23] rapture's coming the lord's coming
[32:26] this day is going to end they look at
[32:28] you and you're gone what then
[32:30] then they will be filled with exceeding
[32:33] fear because there was a testimony
[32:38] in this church sorry if i bore you
[32:44] now here's another testimony who knows
[32:46] the story
[32:48] he's a dude on the rope and there's
[32:50] someone there on the top letting them go
[32:52] down what's that story
[32:54] yes no
[32:58] yes what's her name
[33:02] who likes rayab now rayab
[33:05] she had a testimony as well these two
[33:08] spies comes to her house she goes and
[33:10] hit them
[33:11] and then she goes she tells them and she
[33:13] said unto them
[33:14] i know that the lord has given you the
[33:16] land and that your terror has fallen
[33:19] upon
[33:19] us and that the inhabitants of the land
[33:21] faint because of you
[33:23] of what you did you crossed the red sea
[33:26] you went out of
[33:27] egypt you slew the kings of the amorites
[33:30] and you had the king of shylon and gog
[33:32] og and as soon as they hear these things
[33:35] our hearts did
[33:36] melt neither did they remain any courage
[33:39] in any man because of
[33:41] you christian standing in a workplace
[33:43] saying the lord's gonna come
[33:45] the lord's gonna come
[33:48] she had a testimony that came via the
[33:51] grapevine and when two believers came
[33:53] into her house
[33:54] she knew that was her chance to get
[33:56] salvation for a whole family
[33:58] two believers it took to enter into our
[34:00] house and say good morning sister how
[34:01] are you doing
[34:03] we came on some business we we came to
[34:05] look something for the king you know
[34:07] you know we've got caleb and joshua they
[34:09] they're taking the land they go oh no
[34:11] i know all about you just go hide away
[34:14] and then when they came out she said we
[34:15] know about you because you guys are just
[34:17] giving us the creeps because everybody
[34:19] is just dying around you and you're just
[34:21] conquering every nation and the waters
[34:23] even open up and you walk over it on
[34:25] drive
[34:25] and she had a testimony she was scared
[34:27] but it took the two guys to go to her
[34:30] but when they showed up the work was
[34:32] already done because the testimony of
[34:34] joshua and caleb already arrived
[34:36] in this city before they even beseeched
[34:38] it
[34:40] so the whole big walls jericho all those
[34:42] things were already scared of these guys
[34:44] coming
[34:45] because the testimony went went forth
[34:49] so again your testimony will come back
[34:54] and i'm not angry i'm actually happy i
[34:56] just want to get something here
[35:00] man running away from the presence of
[35:01] the lord how many wishy-washy
[35:05] that's what too many christians are
[35:07] today soft soap
[35:09] and everything until they think they
[35:11] just join a church
[35:13] go somewhere put their name on a book
[35:15] and a little something jump up and down
[35:17] shout something like that and they call
[35:18] that christianity
[35:20] christianity is a everyday rugged life
[35:24] living for god in this present world
[35:27] amen that's christianity that's the
[35:31] definition of christianity brother isaac
[35:32] preached on it as well
[35:34] that's why he found himself six times
[35:36] here
[35:37] maybe he'll be here seventh time and
[35:38] then that's us we've gone
[35:40] i love the numbers but see there was a
[35:43] there was a
[35:44] in there christianity is everyday rugged
[35:47] life
[35:48] he said that little dog who remembers
[35:50] that little dog that he thought he was
[35:52] just a puny dog
[35:54] but that dog had so much fight in him
[35:56] and he said that's it
[35:58] that's it he might be the smallest dog
[36:00] but he thinks he's the king of the block
[36:03] and he acts and conducts himself as the
[36:05] king of the block
[36:07] okay little dog i don't think he'll stay
[36:10] little
[36:12] so
[36:16] it is a consistent burning of fire and
[36:19] love of god so we get our judgment here
[36:22] unfortunately us as christians the
[36:24] moment we as kids we said
[36:26] i have decided to follow jesus
[36:31] then the fire falls and unfortunately
[36:34] when fire falls it burns
[36:38] and it is tough when your best friend
[36:40] tells you i don't believe in god
[36:44] it is tough when a lot of people tell
[36:46] you we don't believe in god
[36:48] show me god joshua this morning
[36:52] how many of my colleagues come to me and
[36:54] say okay here i am show me god
[36:56] where's god i want to talk to him right
[36:59] now
[37:00] don't you think someone that met the
[37:02] lord has seen the miracles he can do
[37:05] standing and looking at a guy that's a
[37:07] real good guy
[37:09] and he's just not seeing it
[37:12] just not seeing it blind to it
[37:18] my dad asked the same question and guess
[37:20] what he made god
[37:22] but he asked that out of respect and
[37:24] humility
[37:25] and these people are asking it out of
[37:27] defiance but that's not your fight
[37:31] you just live that's not your fight
[37:34] you just live the life if you defy the
[37:36] work word of god you're already blinded
[37:38] to it you shall never see the kingdom of
[37:40] god
[37:41] okay unless he gives you grace you
[37:43] cannot see it so if you've asked
[37:45] it's same going to your dad and asking
[37:46] him dad can i have 20 bucks you say hey
[37:48] you owe me 20 bucks
[37:50] you're gonna get two different results
[37:51] from your dad i can promise you that
[37:53] one would be a loving kind yeah maybe
[37:54] i'll give you one the other one will go
[37:56] sorry
[37:57] because your approach is wrong well
[38:00] we're not going there sorry i want to i
[38:01] want to speak about this
[38:05] so we know now we're not wishy-washy
[38:07] chris
[38:08] christians but here we go another one
[38:10] and now this is where you need to please
[38:12] realize this is where my thought came
[38:14] from this little verse right here
[38:16] but it's easy to go the way of the world
[38:20] it is easy to flow down the stream
[38:23] go out there and sit down at the river
[38:25] with your boat so all picture
[38:27] we're in our boats give a bit of space
[38:29] give a bit of space give a little space
[38:30] come on you boys i like it give a bit of
[38:32] space you're in a boat
[38:34] the river's flowing
[38:38] that way so which way are you supposed
[38:40] to be rowing
[38:42] the river's flowing that way which way
[38:44] are we rowing
[38:45] we're rowing up the river why
[38:50] because if you stop rowing what's going
[38:51] to happen
[38:54] okay so you stopped rowing where you
[38:58] going
[39:00] now he's still rowing so you're still
[39:01] standing still you're still rowing ruben
[39:02] went all around now you went as well
[39:04] he's gone as well those two are still
[39:05] rowing so stop rowing
[39:07] here she goes no you stop throwing as
[39:09] well you go as well so just these two
[39:10] are still rowing
[39:12] it's easy to stop the boat
[39:16] and just drift it's much more fun
[39:19] to just let the boat go down the river
[39:22] and it's all nice
[39:24] because if i row my arms get tired hey
[39:27] if you can
[39:28] you think you can do that for the rest
[39:29] of the service like this you tell me how
[39:31] your arms feel
[39:33] okay i might just leave you to do that
[39:35] he says here
[39:37] you will get your oars and start pulling
[39:39] up against the current
[39:41] you don't make much time and it goes
[39:44] hard
[39:45] but you just once let loose of those
[39:48] ores
[39:48] and watch how fast the trees passes past
[39:52] you going down
[39:53] but you but you look where you are going
[39:57] when things are floating easy remember
[39:59] you're going towards a great
[40:01] cataract down there of some sort you are
[40:05] going towards the falls
[40:07] and you won't be long until you're going
[40:09] to
[40:10] go over that falls just floating with
[40:12] the world
[40:13] easy the way it goes you don't want that
[40:16] no sir
[40:17] but you must accept your responsibility
[40:28] keep on rowing but not keep on rowing
[40:31] okay
[40:32] so now he says here when you stop rowing
[40:35] and you the greater the older ones when
[40:38] you stop
[40:39] rowing mr sander don't stop rowing
[40:44] when you stop rowing you will go with
[40:48] the river
[40:49] and when you go with the river there is
[40:52] consequences
[40:53] amen i'm sorry but there is consequences
[40:57] so here we go
[40:59] and the devil that deceived them all was
[41:02] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[41:05] where the beast and the false prophet
[41:06] are and it shall be torment meant it day
[41:10] and night forever and ever now remember
[41:11] that for ever and ever is not eternity
[41:13] it's a time it's a time and a time okay
[41:16] so it's not eternal that forever ever is
[41:18] just a time at all the white throne
[41:20] judgment where they'll be
[41:21] be called before the lord and it says
[41:23] here and i saw a great white throne
[41:25] and him that sat upon it whose face the
[41:28] earth and heaven fled away
[41:31] and were found no place for them
[41:35] and i saw the dead small and great
[41:38] stand before god and the books were open
[41:41] and another book was opened which is the
[41:44] book
[41:44] the book of life and the dead were
[41:47] judged out of those things which were
[41:50] written in the books according to their
[41:54] works workers of iniquity
[41:58] works when they had to stand for the
[42:01] lord their works
[42:03] show different christians and let's say
[42:06] not christians or not they just said
[42:07] they were dead
[42:08] i'll explain to you what death is now
[42:11] not everyone that sayeth unto me lord
[42:14] lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven
[42:16] but he that does the will of my father
[42:18] which are the heaven
[42:19] many will say to me on that day lord
[42:22] lord heaven we prophesied
[42:24] in thy name and in thy name heaven we
[42:26] cast out devils and
[42:28] in thy name done many wonderful works
[42:32] the name of jesus christ talking it's
[42:35] easy to sing it
[42:36] easy to sing and i will profess unto
[42:40] them
[42:40] i never knew you depart from me ye that
[42:42] work iniquity iniquity
[42:44] means something you know and you don't
[42:47] do
[42:49] something you know you ought to do but
[42:52] you don't do it that's iniquity
[42:55] that means god's coming and revealing to
[42:56] you something to say hey it's really
[42:58] important to come to services like this
[43:00] because we don't preach at you just
[43:02] because we think you're bad
[43:04] it is to strengthen you and to help you
[43:06] to see maybe around you because these
[43:07] brothers and sisters around all of you
[43:09] that might be struggling and you're the
[43:12] key
[43:13] you're the key that can unlock that door
[43:16] you because god can preach through the
[43:19] trees he can preach to the roof he can
[43:21] preach through a rock he can preach
[43:22] through anything but he
[43:24] chose you
[43:27] and these people dying in this church as
[43:29] we speak
[43:31] as we speak because we're failing to
[43:34] keep our testimony
[43:37] we're failing to stand in the gap and
[43:39] praying for them how many of you
[43:40] sincerely
[43:41] pray for your brothers and sisters how
[43:44] many at night goes on their bed
[43:47] and kneel and sit put your face in your
[43:49] bed and start crying
[43:51] for your brother that's just walked out
[43:53] of the church
[43:54] but it's easy to say right from wrong
[43:56] it's easy to say they're doing it wrong
[43:58] and look at him but who is bringing him
[44:01] before the lord because god needs those
[44:03] cries
[44:05] god needs it but here we stand
[44:08] and we just accept it ah it's just not
[44:11] for them
[44:16] one of your brothers walk away out of
[44:18] your house say i don't believe in the
[44:20] lord
[44:21] what would you do you can't beat him
[44:24] into
[44:25] a submission what will you do
[44:29] you're going to follow or you're going
[44:31] to go into battle mode into warfare
[44:34] and start fighting back what are you
[44:36] going to do it's happening
[44:38] you tell me youth of today i'm looking
[44:40] at all of you
[44:41] how many is here that's supposed to be

[46:48] was flowing in my animation it just
[46:50] doesn't want to do it on this one
[46:52] but that river is flowing and the snow
[46:54] covering this tree
[46:56] tell me how does that tree feel
[46:59] who he's cold but
[47:03] he's a driftwood

[47:10] so do i always have to be happy and
[47:12] bubbly
[47:14] no do i always understand everything
[47:17] that comes over this pulpit
[47:20] no but you see that tree is still
[47:23] planted
[47:24] and that water is still flowing but it
[47:26] didn't become part of that river
[47:28] now there is the most beautiful rich
[47:31] trees i'm thinking it's a maple canadian
[47:33] maple tree or something like
[47:34] i don't know beautiful color and it's
[47:36] autumn so another season where it's a
[47:39] bit dry and he's just struggling he just
[47:41] he doesn't want to be here he's been
[47:42] sitting in church the whole day
[47:44] and now he comes and this guy with a big
[47:46] nose is sitting here and preaching at
[47:47] him and he's just
[47:48] i just can't anymore i'm just tired i
[47:51] just want to sleep
[47:52] and it feels like that i'm just about to
[47:55] fall asleep
[47:57] but where's the tree tell me where's
[47:59] those trees
[48:02] stole by the water hey so you still
[48:04] showed up
[48:05] though i'm the most boring thing you
[48:07] want to see now you still
[48:09] showed up ah okay where's that tree
[48:14] whoa man makes me thirsty i just want to
[48:16] drink some water right now
[48:20] he's out of fellowship bye huh
[48:23] he has no ways he's brothers and sisters
[48:25] show me those three
[48:27] brothers and sisters brothers and
[48:30] sisters
[48:30] where's that trees
[48:34] oh but he doesn't have excuse that tree
[48:35] does it because look at his leaves
[48:38] he's still growing because this tree
[48:41] has a personal walk with the lord jesus
[48:43] christ and the god said
[48:45] i will water you day and night. so not
[48:48] your circumstances
[48:50] but i the lord will give you strength
[48:52] and that tree is growing in the middle
[48:54] of a desert why
[48:56] because it's good to be in fellowship
[48:58] but there's no excuse if you get out of
[49:00] fellowship to walk away from the lord
[49:02] no excuse because it's god first
[49:04] brothers sisters mom dads all those
[49:06] things
[49:07] last sorry it's true
[49:11] god said i come to divide
[49:15] not to unite because i'm a jealous god
[49:18] and i want all the attention
[49:19] where's that tree now the rest
[49:23] of this is about that eye
[49:26] it's about that eye okay it's a massive
[49:29] waterfall
[49:30] is that driftwood okay
[49:33] what's flying there seagulls or eagles i
[49:37] just hope it's eagles and not seagulls
[49:39] but okay
[49:40] pick up the purpose too they're rats
[49:42] with wings they eat everything and clean
[49:44] everything up seagulls but they're
[49:46] really annoying those are eagles flying
[49:47] there i just said pretend i'll make it
[49:49] eagles
[49:50] so that plant tree is on a mountain this
[49:53] high having a jubilee
[49:55] and he's singing it's bubbling it's
[49:56] bubbling it's bubbling every day
[49:59] so some days you find yourself here
[50:01] christians
[50:03] some days you find yourself here some
[50:05] days you find yourself here
[50:07] i pray you don't find yourself here
[50:10] or there now i'm going to ask you one
[50:14] thing
[50:15] i want you to now just think about
[50:17] yourself because this is my whole lesson
[50:18] i don't have much more
[50:21] i know it was the blood there's a
[50:24] scripture i wanted to read
[50:29] and i just want to end with that and
[50:30] then
[50:32] i want you to think about where you
[50:34] standing with god at this moment
[50:39] can we go to philippians 3 verse 9
[50:46] and verse 10 this is my bible
[50:50] i used to use this phone for everything
[50:53] but god
[50:55] now i use this phone to further the
[50:58] kingdom of god
[51:00] awesome i the devil don't like it he
[51:02] tried to make me sick before i came here
[51:04] he says and be found in him not having
[51:08] my
[51:08] own righteousness which is of the law
[51:11] but which is through the faith of christ
[51:14] the righteousness which is of god by
[51:17] faith
[51:18] i need faith that i may know
[51:22] him in the power and the resurrection of
[51:25] his resurrection
[51:27] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[51:29] being made
[51:30] con conformable unto his death
[51:34] now what that means in short
[51:37] is may you be found in jesus christ
[51:40] before you get found in this world
[51:42] now how many of you and this is where
[51:45] you get to speak to the lord
[51:47] and i maybe give you just a couple of
[51:48] minutes i want you now to
[51:51] just maybe separate their boys a little
[51:53] bit from each other
[51:54] more you move there and
[51:57] there in the middle just there's a
[51:59] reason there's a lot of space in here
[52:00] which is good
[52:02] i want you to think quickly just
[52:05] quickly are you driftwood
[52:09] or are you a tree
[52:15] okay so if you're a tree
[52:19] and there's wood drifting past you what
[52:22] should you do
[52:26] help them
[52:29] pray for them
[52:32] we come up whatever it needs to be done
[52:35] that's what we need to do
[52:37] so you came to a youth service you
[52:39] didn't need to be here
[52:41] i didn't want to preach we wanted to do
[52:43] a skit today
[52:46] but it didn't work out that way and i'm
[52:48] glad i didn't because when brother isaac
[52:50] started preaching this morning
[52:52] see the thing that we forget as children
[52:54] is you think that
[52:55] you have no power because you're just a
[52:58] kid
[52:59] is that right kid is a goat you're not a
[53:01] kid you're a child of god
[53:03] though you're still a child you're a
[53:05] child of
[53:06] so who's got power who's got the most
[53:09] power in the whole whole universe who's
[53:11] super duper awesome triple power
[53:13] everything
[53:15] yes why
[53:19] because i got god so can you pray and
[53:21] things change
[53:23] so do you want things to change in this
[53:24] church
[53:26] do we want things to change in this
[53:27] church yes you know why we're all here
[53:30] somebody prayed for you
[53:33] you know that you know why you're here
[53:35] just because your mom and dad comes
[53:38] no why why are they there brother isaac
[53:40] why did you come here
[53:43] brother why did you come here
[53:46] huh brother james you you shared
[53:49] same same similar stories than i do
[53:53] just a bit more next level but where did
[53:55] you come from
[53:56] and what brought you here and if it was
[53:58] so nice out there what are you still
[54:00] doing here
[54:01] why do you come every sunday every
[54:04] monday
[54:05] when it's hot when it's cold why are
[54:08] they here
[54:11] there's no excuse for staying at home
[54:15] if you can be here
[54:18] if you are sick and you're in bed
[54:22] you've got a massive headache or
[54:23] something like that i could understand
[54:26] but we are here because we want everyone
[54:28] to be here
[54:29] now there is some children that that
[54:31] recently and this is your burden
[54:33] this is where i want to bring it into
[54:35] your your lap
[54:36] that either can't make it by a
[54:39] circumstance
[54:41] or just not the decided to follow jesus
[54:44] now i want to ask your children what can
[54:46] we do about it
[54:48] so can we pray for them can we honestly
[54:52] now in this service pray for them
[54:55] do you think it's fair now i want to ask
[54:58] you something do you think they'll come
[54:59] in
[55:03] yes because who can stop the prayers of
[55:06] the saint
[55:08] nothing nothing can stop the
[55:11] almighty god's power if you pray with
[55:14] sincerity
[55:15] so why don't we as a church start
[55:17] praying for our brothers and sisters
[55:19] young and old instead of saying what's
[55:22] wrong
[55:23] instead of pointing out the driftwood
[55:25] but actually
[55:26] praying for them can we do that as young
[55:29] ones
[55:30] i don't need to preach to the old ones
[55:33] i'm talking
[55:34] about you you're the you're the ones
[55:35] that that is in the middle of it
[55:38] right who understands if somebody walks
[55:41] away
[55:43] who understands it i don't
[55:48] i don't understand why somebody would
[55:50] not choose life
[55:53] but is it going to stop me praying for
[55:54] it so let's pray
[55:58] i want you all to take time now close
[56:00] your eyes
[56:01] and pray together with me you can pray
[56:04] out loud
[56:05] you can pray in your heart doesn't
[56:06] matter all i want you to do is be
[56:08] sincere now
[56:10] and pray for someone that you know
[56:14] that needs it right now
[56:18] just one person whoever is in your heart
[56:20] who is even your head
[56:22] i want you sincerely go before god now
[56:25] and say lord jesus
[56:27] be merciful bring
[56:30] them back let's close our eyes
[56:37] lord jesus we love our brothers and
[56:41] sisters so much
[56:44] lord and church is not the same without
[56:45] them here
[56:47] lord i've got so many prayer requests on
[56:49] my heart that i
[56:51] i just see children lord jesus walking
[56:53] from the face of god
[56:56] lord and good children lord with praying
[56:58] parents lord and devout
[57:00] christian homes that they were raised in
[57:02] lord
[57:03] and lord satan is trying them
[57:07] lord and they need help father they need
[57:09] reinforcements
[57:10] they need what brother isaac said today
[57:13] they need your bodyguards around them
[57:15] lord jesus
[57:16] they need mercy and they need grace
[57:19] father so every child in this church i
[57:22] know has someone in their heart
[57:24] even one of their friends lord that
[57:26] really need you
[57:27] lord jesus that truly needs to know that
[57:30] you live and i pray today
[57:32] of all these children lord that they
[57:35] will be witnesses unto thee
[57:37] that they would be living trees no
[57:39] matter in what season in their life
[57:42] but be living trees for you lord jesus
[57:45] lord that what they do and what they set
[57:48] out every morning
[57:49] lord for your kingdom lord let there not
[57:52] be children in this church that's a
[57:54] false witness
[57:55] that is lord sitting in school and
[57:58] hiding away like noah lord jesus
[58:01] oh jonah lord sorry
[58:04] lord because jonah lord he refused
[58:08] to be in your presence he refused to be
[58:10] that testimony
[58:12] lord to go down lord to nineveh and
[58:14] speak to those people
[58:15] who were ready to receive your word lord
[58:17] jesus
[58:19] he forsook that and lord he had to go
[58:22] through many a trials
[58:23] to put him on that place so that you
[58:25] could use him and even then lord
[58:28] he didn't understand how you saw the
[58:29] whole situation
[58:31] lord but we want to see how you see lord
[58:33] and we know that our prayers
[58:35] it matters we know that if every son
[58:38] and daughter of god matter how big and
[58:40] or how small lord
[58:42] comes before the king and bows down and
[58:44] asks for your help lord jesus
[58:46] that all hell will shake lord jesus
[58:49] because we are believers
[58:51] and they said that all things are
[58:53] possible to
[58:54] them that believe this prophet ours lord
[58:57] jesus came with nothing new
[58:59] but the truth no man spoke like this man
[59:02] lord because he came and told the truth
[59:04] lord jesus and no matter what this world
[59:07] says
[59:08] we are sold out lord to the truth and
[59:10] the message of this
[59:11] hour now lord i just want to ask if
[59:14] there is children in here
[59:15] that don't believe this if there's
[59:17] anyone in your lord jesus that haven't
[59:20] met you personally
[59:21] or decided to follow you lord or even
[59:24] lord has the desire in the heart at the
[59:26] moment
[59:27] even to follow you lord may you come to
[59:30] their pew
[59:30] may you come to this seat now right now
[59:33] in the name of our lord jesus christ as
[59:35] the great creator lord
[59:36] i didn't come in and stand here lord and
[59:39] talk to these guys for anything of me
[59:41] lord
[59:41] but to introduce christ to each child
[59:44] lord jesus
[59:45] and each mom and dad or jesus because
[59:47] that is what is in my heart
[59:49] and that is if we are outside of you
[59:52] if we are outside of you lord it is
[59:55] certain
[59:56] death it is firewood lord it is
[59:59] driftwood lord
[1:00:00] and i don't want to be driftwood lord
[1:00:02] jesus i want to be a tree
[1:00:04] lord that stands against the elements
[1:00:06] and draw
[1:00:07] my strength from you o lord the the
[1:00:10] river of god flowing through the city of
[1:00:12] god lord jesus
[1:00:14] lord i pray that these children may
[1:00:16] realize that they have a great
[1:00:18] commission
[1:00:19] towards their friends that on their age
[1:00:22] their testimony could set someone free
[1:00:26] if if lord if jonah never shared that
[1:00:29] message
[1:00:30] the princes of that city wouldn't have
[1:00:33] said to the whole city to repent
[1:00:35] put satcloth and ashes over all the
[1:00:37] animals over
[1:00:39] everything and ask god for mercy
[1:00:42] lord and it was granted unto them and a
[1:00:44] whole nation
[1:00:46] a whole nation came to repentance
[1:00:49] because of
[1:00:49] one man that went and just did as he was
[1:00:52] told lord
[1:00:54] lord may we not forsake to do what we
[1:00:56] are told right now
[1:00:58] to be a witness in our schools in our
[1:01:00] workplace
[1:01:01] lord even in this church when someone is
[1:01:03] doing something that's not
[1:01:06] not pleasing to you lord
[1:01:10] as hard as it may be that we would
[1:01:12] correct them out of love
[1:01:13] in a nice way saying have you thought
[1:01:16] about this
[1:01:18] lord because we receive our correction

[1:01:26] corrected here lord so that we don't go

[1:01:34] found
[1:01:35] in the lamb's book of life they don't
[1:01:37] get judged lord
[1:01:38] because they accepted your sacrifice
[1:01:41] lord may our children
[1:01:42] stand between the living and the dead
[1:01:45] may they stand between the driftwood and
[1:01:47] the trees lord

[1:05:10] this morning
[1:05:13] if there is nothing if there was no god
[1:05:17] okay and you lived a christian life
[1:05:20] loving other people and caring for other
[1:05:22] people what do you have to lose

[1:05:27] of the widow
