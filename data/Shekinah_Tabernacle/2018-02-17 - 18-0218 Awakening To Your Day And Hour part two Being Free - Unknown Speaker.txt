brother Nene has moved down hallelujah so praise the Lord [Applause] have you a man plays the Lord just what announcement is we're turning to the scripture if you got your Bibles go to Deuteronomy 32 but just as we're turning up so there's lunch at the community hub down there it stucks fairly just by the new world everything there at one o'clock and also if we could just remember in prayer let's uh let's just read the scripture here and then we'll we'll go to prayer so Deuteronomy 32 great heavy everyone here today praise the Lord you know it's always it's always good together and see what a little here for us so verses 9 to 12 of Deuteronomy 32 and we have it there says here for the Lord's portion of his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in a waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttering over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them birth up on her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there is no strange God with him Amen so and just as we go to prayer brother Doug bakers he's a passion to son of love divine fellowship they've had a head of fire in their sanctuary they think it's suspicious there's been an arson or something that happened on Wednesday let's just pray for the believers and louse how they're being persecuted by the denomination they're being threatened don't preach anymore don't baptize the people name Lord Jesus Christ you know we're going to call the police and well leasing siliceous let's just remember these needs and if you ever need you want to lift your hand to the Lord just as we go to prayer gracious father we just want to come before you Lord just with such Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord for what you've done for us father we thank you that your blood is made us night to you Lord you have bridge the chasm father you've broken down the middle wall of partition father we're on speaking terms logger and fellowship with you father we're so glad Lord you're not a distant God some place or some God of the past but you're God of the present and you said you'd be among your children where two or three are gathered in your name and we're gather the name of Lord Jesus Christ father we want to pray for brother Doug Baker father love divine fellowship there in Tucson Lord as there's been a fire in their sanctuary father may be suspicious they don't know there's been an arson attack but Lord they want to have meetings Lord and I just pray your strength in the congregation father now they

threatening to call the police and doing different things in that place lor I pray you'd strengthen your children yes father we know this persecution Lord their father if it was but Lord if the truth

need you to come Lord we don't want to just be a gathering of people we're not interested in that Lord we want to be gathered to You Father we can speak to our hearts you can change our lives Lord we can have a closer walk with you so father I pray you'll just have your preeminence in this service may you grant it Almighty God we ask in your wonderful name and name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning now I have another scripture to readin in the book of Galatians as well Galatians 4 and 21 to 24 just tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one was a bondmaid the other was a free woman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was a by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one was from Mount Sinai which is gendereth to bondage which is agar which is Hagar in the Old Testament for this agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem witches of above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written rejoice thou barren that birth not break forth and cry now that travail if not for the desolate hath more children than she which as and a husband now ye brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even solders now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so then brethren ye are not children of the bondwoman but of the free amen and I want to I want to continue from Wednesday we're talking about yeah being awakened to the day and hour in which we live and I want to talk about being free you know we read there and Deuteronomy as an eagle stirreth nice and and and and your bridge over her little ones and that says the Lord has done for but speaks of Jacob there in Deuteronomy we know that that speaks about us and a believer lives in a very different kind of atmosphere and place than people in the world and this is if I could say this you know where are you living today now yeah I'm going to show you two photos and this is basically my entire sermon right here now this is the children of the bondwoman now this is not a barnyard maybe you know you'd have a free-range chicken but a chicken is still stuck behind the fence it's not it's earthbound that's not free to soar in the heavenly Amen it's stuck in a man man-made device just as just as these chickens are here that's like a battery farm but they're but they're in a cage now a cage there's many different cages in the land today but legalism and liberalism are both cages I mean we want to go beyond just just being earthbound and stuck in some kind of cage God doesn't want us bound God wants a soaring in the heavenlies with heaven I mean that's what he wants he doesn't want us to be stuck in you know rats can go through their mice can go through their anything can go through those cages and the things trapped account it can overcome and it can't fly above it but that's not where we mean to be I mean this is what this this is not what this message is called us to become as we start to be an earthbound creature we're called to soar without with our Poppa God Alleluia so is that where you're living or is this where you're living Alleluia now this is the this is the question this is an eagle's nest high up in a harp and a mountain place amen you see it's not there's no cage around it there's just blue sky hallelujah is just up in the mountain they can see for miles around holily there's no rats or any things of any devils going to get into that kind of mess hallelujah that's where that's where God's free born children are meant to dwell that's where we're meant to dwell so where are you where are you going I mean where are you living because freedom you know people speak of being free in Christ and the whole pretty much the whole church will say we are free but what does it mean to be free because some people say well we're free that means they can do what they want but that's not real freedom real freedom is to fly with him I mean because people are still a lot of people say well Randa oh well just gonna I'll find it first I'm gonna jump around a bit but hey now here in Romans what are we free from we're free from sin Christ makes us free from sin and the attributes thereof he doesn't we don't just say we're free but we're still balland those chickens would say well you know look we're we're we've got a roof over our head we're being protected we're being fed you know we're we're not out you know being being under attacked by predators so we're kind of free in that way but they're bound a man they're still back we're not called to be bound when I could just a beast you know you know eat some little old you know stuff that man just puts out and stuck there in a cage and that's not what life is to be amen so now I'll come back to all that later but it says in Romans 6 it says now freedom real freedom us to be free from sin real freedom is to be free from the effects of sin that's real freedom amen and Christ died to give us that freedom he didn't die just for us to have some religion and talk about it he died that we would experience actually live out freedom hallelujah because man has always been bound since the fall in the garden man has been a slave I mean but our Lord Jesus came to die on Calvary arose again over hell death and the grave triumphant that you would be free as he is free amen and this message is come in this in time to show you this is what freedom really is I mean this is what freedom that's more than just talking about it I mean it's living it I mean like a prisoner a prisoner in a Cell they can sit there and they can talk about what it's like to be free but when the gate comes open hallelujah and then the warden or whatever says now you're free to go hallelujah Amen I bet you I don't think there'd be any real prisoner and their right mind that would be said to walk out of their cells matter how long they've been in there how much how nice it may have been you know anyone in their right mind would say now I'm free hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends I trust you should I pray you know the freedom the real liberty that's in Christ Jesus our Lord that you can live and you do I pray by the power of his blood above sin above this flesh hallelujah this is what Christianity is about it's not just being bogged down by you know just a religion or whatever more he's a real Liberty it's a real Liberty so he sees he that is deed it's freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe we shall also live with him now if you'll really did you're free from sin amen I'm nothing about you know if you've really died out to yourself really died out being born again a real birth a real new birth you're free from sin if you did you got to be dead I mean you got to really die out to everything you think everything you once loves all of your ambitions hopes and plans and your pride and everything you think you are yeah it's got to be dead it's going to be dead and done away with hallelujah and that's what's our glorious God is here to give us that it's not something we could never obtain - that's why he died that we could have it he died two places and man's hand again you can be free from the effects of the devil you can be free from this bondage you can be free from everything he tries to put down your throat you can be free and not just a part time freedom all the time free hallelujah Jesus himself said whom the son is set free is free indeed that's not partially free that's not well negotiate and you can have weekends and all over the week free and D hallelujah this is what the power of the Cross does and it's got to be more than a talking about it it's got to be a live it's going to be something we actually have and I and I believe with all my soul we have the the powers present in this word and this entire message to free people amen hey that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise Rick and he also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord now that's not just mental gymnastics it's got to become a reality no we go again does this died on me yeah we know alright let not sin therefore reign over your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness understand but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness under God for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace now this is the definition of grace straight from the Strong's Concordance of this this here grace under grace and you'll find this in the New Testament find this in the Old Testament see it's here I know I've showed this many times so I wonder they're really there now if you're under the law I mean if you're not under the law something's happened to you I mean something's happened to you as I said you can be liberal and be under the law you can be legal and be under the law but if you're really free from it something's happened to your soul something's happened to you so he said graciousness as gratifying of manner or act abstract or concrete literal figurative spiritual especially I love this word especially especially the divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection in the life this is what the definition of Grace's is a divine influence I mean has come upon the heart of the you know of the believer and it's reflected in the life so it's not just saying our grace grace God's grace there's a reflection I mean as a manifestation grace has come upon me God's grace is falling on me and my life is reflecting that Christ hallelujah amen that's like an eagle who's been in a chicken coop in the grace of the mother Eagle comes I mean she flies over there kept looking for a child I mean begins to scream out that Eagle begins to look up I mean there's a divine influence begins to move hallelujah and that chopping is to recognize I'm not meant to be down here can you imagine living in this kind of place and you're not even built to live in this place can you imagine living there and and and your body is not built to digest the food your body is not built to be in a cage like that hallelujah imagine living in that kind of place that's how every man woman and child is amen but in there yeah in among humanity it's not just all chickens you're an eagle and the chicken and the same kind of bird I mean I mean they are birds I mean they are the same kind of family tree or wolf whatever you want to call it but an eagle is different to a chicken I mean a chicken you know it just scavengers around and eat seeds and different things and eagles not built that way an eagle and a chicken is more of an earthbound kind of creature Eagles are not earthbound creatures they called the sore upon the heavenlies I mean I remember the first Eagle I ever saw some Papua New Guinea and it was high up and just had its wings fixed and was just I was just soaring straight across the across the sky as fast but it wasn't even flapping trying to mention a chicken trying to get up here flapping its little wings as high as it could go I think you're just sets of wings soils and heavily hallelujah and that's what we mean to be that's what God has called us to be God and God did not make us he did not design men to be in a battery farm like this of life amen imagine being an eagle stuck in that kind of place you'd get around you'd feel sick amen you know you you're trying to digest the food because it's all you have you're trying to find something to sustain you amen and you got these big wings you can't even move because you're stuck in this kind of cage but then one day mama comes amen and you begin to realize this is actually what I mean to be this is what I mean to be I'm not meant to be a chicken stuck there just to be you know a production-line kind of person I meant to soar in the heavenlies hallelujah but it's only when grace comes I just leave that up for maybe a few moment I want you I want everyone to read that again especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life do you know grace do you know the grace of God God's grace is not oh I can do what I want and he'll forgive me later no it's a divine influence comes upon you I mean that whatever his word wants you to do you're yes Lord yes Lord your smallest your your smallest desire because my greatest command you're a greatest commandment to me because I love you I want to fulfill your word I don't just want to have a casual kind of relationship with you I want my whole life to manifest you I want my whole life to glorify you hallelujah but pride stops that many times self ability stops that many times what we think we are amen our stubbornness stops grace really manifesting in our lives and her and the only person we rub ourselves off as ourselves imagine imagine earth chicken I mean an eagle a proud eagle stuck in here mother comes flying over you mean to soar with me little child Eagle get sprout what do you mean I'm I'm the king of this place because all the chickens are scared of Eagles I'm the king of this place I have great influence down here what do you mean you I meant to soar with you I'm doing perfectly fine down here and the pride of that little Eagle will keep it earthbound don't let your pride keep you stuck earthbound you say Lord you want me I'm built this Saul with you I'm going to soar with you hallelujah I would not be stuck down here on the earth God has not made us to be earthbound creatures I mean when the devil just comes in rats come in mice come in Devils come in do whatever they want to our lives I mean that's not where I mean to be amen we're eager you know one of God's eat I mean the saw said why's he called you isn't cool you just refer you to look up and see him there I mean he called you that you would begin to flap some wings flap your wings your god-given winter faith I mean soar up into the heavenlies with them you say well is that there's the case let's go here amen divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life that's grace that is what grace means in the Greek and I say Amen I mean since God's grace has gotta fall upon you because if it's not reflected if this word if you're still fighting the scripture I mean grace is not fallen upon you because it's not our reflection of it in your life I mean when someone when the grace of God falls upon someone repented me baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ amen partly that's reflected yes flood I wanna be buried with you I want to be identified with you Amen there's a life of holiness to live amen hallelujah I want to dress the way is pleasing to you don't act the way that's pleasing because it's a reflection and the life it's not because I've got to do this because there's no it's being reflected the grace of God is reflected in your life oh how glad I am hallelujah amen you take someone it depends what spirits in you you take someone who's a who's a crazy you know soccer fan I'll just use it or rugby whatever they get to the stadium stadium early you know they're they're having a having a barbecue and the parking lot would evil more their pre-loading you know they're having a few bit they're getting in the spirit they put on their national colors because they want to be identified with their team and they're getting excited and they've got their tickets doesn't they don't really care the cost of it they've been saving maybe for a long time hallelujah do they go to the stadium I mean they want to get there early they don't want to turn up at halftime they don't want to turn up late that would it be there I'm in my seat hallelujah I'm really hallelujah I'm waiting for them for for my team to come and then they and then when their team comes and they begin to scream they begin to shout those are my people on the field I'm identified with them and I begin to sing the songs of the rest of the crowd of their team and I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I mean these people almost everywhere hearts roll aflame hallelujah by the fire that fell at Pentecost amen but they wouldn't be singing it in but you know what I mean I mean they'd be gonna be singing their songs and when they're and when their team is doing well I mean they're rejoicing they think they're bulletproof and when their team is failing I mean they're broken they're discouraged waste on them sometimes they won't turn up to work the next day you know bad things happen and they're and they're so discouraged and why is that because they're in the spirit of the game and you don't have to drag them there you don't have to talk them into it all will be the best game and look at the players this is the best final you ever see it this is the best rugby or cricket or whatever more you don't have to drag them there be there hallelujah and you don't have to kick them to you know keep them staying there to watch it they're there they'll be there the whole time hallelujah and when they leave the stadium they'll continue talking about it and the highs and lows now watch the replays and won't even walk why because they're in the spirit of what's going on and they are proud to be identified they don't care about the reproach of their team they're proud to be identified with them that's just natural things that's not eternal things amen how much more how much more people I mean that has the same spirit of a God hallelujah and he comes down I mean you don't have to drag them to church to attract them to a meetings they want to be there I made all this special meeting somewhere let's go on being God's presence I'm gonna be where my father is hallelujah and they'll dress up I mean though we're your godly clothing because they want to be identified and not just on the Sunday every day of the week yet wearing their team colors hallelujah I'm on Jesus estate amen and every night of the week that's how they'll be and when they go home that's how they'll be how live cuz the game is going on hallelujah and when God's doing you know when God moves they rejoice amen and then when this hardship they pray however they know they have the victory and they're not ashamed you see some of the people in you likely you know soccer fans and stuff you know those crazy fans fan is short for phonetic and they paintin themselves all crazy colors that it's sub-zero weather and they're there and they're screaming and they're rejoicing most people don't care they're not worried or what will that guy in seat 5d think of me if I start shot it they don't care about that or what if I'm on camera they don't care about that they just rejoicing in the atmosphere of the meaning of the game hallelujah what about us this is eternal things Jesus is not dead he's not in history he's risen and he's present I am very happy to be identified with him I'm not ashamed of him and everything I do I'm not ashamed of her hallelujah we should be proud because it's not you trying to join the team he he's called you to join the team I mean come be one of them I've chosen you to be one of them hallelujah but what will my friends and family whatever more think of me I'm not worried forget what other people say about you it gives about peer pressure you know our family and culture and whatever more now I want to be identified with him hallelujah amen but don't be proud and sit back and say no I'm not willing to be identified with these people I'm identified with the woman at the well I'm identified Amen with Legion in the tombs I'm identified with a bunch of illiterate fisherman who became the apostles I'm identified with those in the apple room who bother approach hallelujah I identified with all the believers down through with all their glory everything that they did all their shame whatever people said about them I'd be proud to be there in the upper room I'd be proud to be identified with the apostles in the first age wouldn't you now here's a bit of a stinger you say yeah be proud but what about today because if you're not proud to be identified with the word in this day you wouldn't stand with it in that day it's that simple now Ephesians 1:24 and you had he quickened who once in the battery farm I'm just going to read it a bit differently just keep that picture of the chickens in there and you have a quick and maid of life who once in the battery farm dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you're stuck in a barnyard coop thinking this is what you'll mean to be amen thinking what you mean to be we're an entire space you walked according to the course of this world according to the farmer who just feed you all this old food all the time according to the Prince of the power of the year this is what we once were hallelujah the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also you all had your conversation in times past this is where you used to live and the chicken coop amen and times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind now that's just more than going and committing adultery fornication whatever will that's pandering to the sky I don't feel like going I don't feel like doing this you're pandering to this I'll look like some old some old model somewhere who's who's out of date with clothing and fashion that's pandering to this amen fulfilling of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as even as others see you in the coop but God who's Richard mercy for his great love we're and he loved us came searching for you hallelujah even when you were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved divine influence comes upon you o God forgive me of my sins amen the cross is not a story just a story it's a reality it's not just something of history hallelujah raises up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus taking you from the barnyard up into the heavenlies because heavenly places the believers position in Christ this is where wants you to be that an ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace you saved through faith and it's not of yourselves as a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them that God has ordained that you would fly with him in the heavenlies and that's what he's ordained you to be so friends it's got to come a sanctification it's got to be a cleansing and a sitting apart you have to be cleanse from the world you can't you can't take the world and bring it into Christ I mean so he's got a change if there's something in your heart that is fighting against his word you have to say Lord change my heart that I will live your word I mean God just doesn't exclude some parts of a scripture not to you because you say I'm not ready to do it you have to say Lord take my heart cleanse it that there's nothing in me that fights you because if you fight us word you're fighting him amen and gods and Paul sit with the missile the Ministry of reconciliation I mean to be reconciled to God that's not God doesn't have to change it's us it has to change I mean if there's something in our hearts that says no I will not live your word God you have to say Lord take that out of me because all that is is the barnyard trying to pin you down on the earth that is not your portion friend you've got to say Lord take it out of me I want to fly with you amen it has to be that way it has to be a cleansing you may come out of Egypt but Egypt has got to come out of you and then you've got to cross Jordan to get the self and go into the Promised Land hallelujah that's what he wants us to do that's not as I said legalisms a cage liberalism's a cage walk out of the cage amen fly with him don't have anything against God's Word in your heart whatever you do kick it out because that is the devil robbing you of soaring in the heavenlies don't let the devil rob you don't let them rob you he wants her do you think he wants God's children to fly free what is his plan all of God's children I'm going to drag with me down to a lake of fire and they will not they will not be free sin since shackles will never be broken this is what he this is his purpose when he came against Eve and made man fall that was his best shot because he knew if I can get the whole of humanity board and said lost and undone separated from God then I've got them hallelujah this is what he wanted this is his purpose amen and the Lord knew that it would happen and your oughta happen he wasn't scared and wringing his hands when the fall happened in Eden he knew was going to happen they meant he and he had already provided a way of redemption back hallelujah and so now and so now that's why that's why that's the devil's purpose but what is God's purpose now I want my children by me I want my bride by me that where I am they will be also I mean I want them to soar with me I want to show my power you know a mother or a father Eagle they're in their nest they can't have a relationship with their child that's down in the boneyard I mean they've got to bring the child to where to where they are hallelujah because just like any parent they want to express themselves their children they want to make themselves known to their children I mean their character their nature everything they can do they want their children to look up and have confidence in them mommy and daddy know what your they've got it in control hallelujah Amy it's just like great great Jehovah regal Amy remember Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus Christ her than you I mean he wants to gather us lift us up hallelujah begin to show himself shows power amen yes what he wants to do now sinners unbelief it's that simple sinners unbelief does Jesus Christ the same in 1963 now we all know that sinners unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already now sin is the attribute of unbelief smoking cigarettes is not a sense is not a sin lying is not a sin commit committing adultery is not a sin what is it then you'd say it's the attributes of unbelief if you're a believer you could not do those things amen if you remember when grace comes in when grace fully comes in and it's manifested in the life your life is different there's got to be a difference amen and sin has to go hallelujah sin has to go if faith comes in unbelief goes out amen so if you are now filled with faith Amen then there's attributes of faith that are now manifested your life is different that's the attributes of unbelief if you're a believer you could not do those things the reason you do it proves you're an unbeliever now this may scratch it but but I just I just want you to you know you got to look at the devil will make you think you're a believer and everything's fine amen he will actually think make you think you're fine when you're still in the barnyard he will lie to you saying no everything's fine you don't want to be stuck in that category amen don't let him lie to you yeah we are call to fly with walk with God hallelujah are you following me now the reason you do it proves you're an unbeliever there's only two factions that's either you're a believer or not a believer and how it always possibly that a man could claim to have the Holy Ghost in them and deny the word being true amen hey you may stumble I'll just say this you may stumble and fall right but that's different then actually it's actually just having unbelief in your life working amen that's two different things so I want I want you to settle that in your mind but you say he says now it always puzzled me that a man could claim to have the Holy Ghost and deny the word of God being true now well how do people say what's not true they just don't throw it out they just say well that's just not for me and that is the same as saying it's not true amen it's just as the same as saying it's not true see now when the Holy Ghost itself wrote the word of God do you believe it do you believe all was poor and John and Moses and whoever more know God took people use their well I'm left-handed but maybe most yeah whatever but I pass this and begin to write that was God writing this is God riding through me he may have used men but this is God's words it's not Moses and Isaiah in different one this is God writing hallelujah so he wrote the scriptures and he stands by the scriptures and God watches over them to confirm them now this isn't why in 1963 I believe in this old-time Holy Ghost salvation oh brother sister it does something to you the same God loved one time still lives today his same his same doctrine of holiness just lives tonight is the same as it ever lived just the same thing yes sir notice the people has got away from the doctrine over that's all now now yes sir number our number one heart disease doesn't the main thing that kills people today it's number one is the sin disease and sin is unbelief I'm believing what the Bible that's right yes it's the number one sin disease that kills the people today both spiritually and they'll make them kill them physically of course cuz they already can prove that man that holds grudges and woman who fussing stew and fighting argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus everything else will sit and ulcers see you were made to be happy and free you were made to live like children before your father and know that he makes every day everything work out for you each day yes sir the people's just afraid of this new birth that's all they're afraid to come to it because it'll straighten them up amen that's what people are afraid of it you say well how could how could temper and fussing and grudges cause disease well a merry heart does good like a medicine but the other one drop the bones yeah it does bad you see people who are always always so tense and anger and different things it begins to manifest physically in their bodies amen so that's why of course and this sin causes this thing this is not where we call now whenever I'm just you're going down this line just think chicken coop okay just think chicken coop battery farm this is no way we're cool tool if we're not cool to live in those kind of places we have to we are called to live in the heavenlies with him amen this is where we're not called to be be dictated to by the spirit of this world hallelujah now you notice an eagle it lives wait where we will go back I think an eagle builds its nest high up off the ground high up off the ground it doesn't put its nest on the ground it puts it in a different atmosphere then then we're the chickens look they're both bullets but Eagles live in a totally different realm that a chicken knows nothing about now an eagle can think it's a chicken but a chicken can even become an eagle amen and it's like when we were born in this world we were chickens we thought we were chickens they meant we thought this was this is our lot in life and this is just the well we've got to get a good job and get the mortgage in the end and in the quarter acre section and all that you know living the family or whatever the American dream or the Kiwi dream or whatever you know it's it's this is this is what we've got to do but that's just that we're not cool to live like this we got the call to live in a different atmosphere and so we can we were born that way thinking this is our lot in life maybe join a church have some kind of religion but there's a big difference from having a religion than really walking with him it's a totally different thing hallelujah and we're not called just to just to have a religion he wants us to fly with him I remember now there comes a point now where we're like this little baby in the little baby in the in the nest here now this one I don't think and slide you see it but there comes a time with a little baby II who can actually fly that's got feathers now the nest Eagle's Nest a very big if you go google it they're actually very big very big places and there's and and the mother Eagle puts like rabbit skins and different things in it to keep it nice and soft but there comes a time where now baby Eagles gotta fly and then now mother you'll begin to stir up the nest and take out all the comforts you know when we started you know when you first had a walk with the Lord everything was glorious I pray it still is but it comes a time when the nest begins to be stood up because he doesn't want you to sit in the nest and I praise the Lord Here I am a my little list he wants you to fly he wants you to exercise your faith he wants you to really say do you trust me and when you imagine mother Eagle because you're about this big mother you will be massive to you flies them with these big wings lands and flaps and wings and you get kind of blown across than this and she begin to say I'm Your Mother you say men I'm all-powerful hallelujah amen amen I'm the same yesterday today and forever remember he's Jehovah regal he doesn't talk to you I mean I'm the same yesterday today and forever amen I took you out of the barnyard ain't in daddy hallelujah I've been lifted up in the cleft of the rock and the secret place how hiders were your dwelling amen I'm your healer amen I'm your provider Amen Lord yes you are hallelujah you are I'm looking after you I'm nourishing you in the face yes look I want you to be like me Amen but then now here comes the okay do what does that entail because mama or daddy flies and you're stuck in a nest and you may watch him go up and do everything but now I want you to be like me now here comes the nest during time the baby has a lot of loose feathers we don't want to have loose but the mother knows if that baby's got loose feathers and they begin to fly those feathers will come out and the baby won't be able to fly it will crash and die it's the same thing with us it comes a time when we have to fly where it's more than just argument and debate and as this Wright and his brother burn right here and right here now he wants us to fly to go beyond our human opinion of dismiss as you say this is you Lord manifested in this hour hallelujah this is the Son of man being revealed this is Jesus Christ walking this generation I mean making this Bible live again hallelujah this is what it is it's not something else it's heaven amen so there comes a time when we're going to recognize this and then us now so now daddy's like okay now you're gonna fly but there has to be a nice during hallelujah there's got to be a lot of loose feathers they've got to be dug out of you now see if I can find this one I hope you don't mind the reading we we called the fly don't be earthbound he says now this live little eagle as she's done that purposely so this is to stir up the nest because God doesn't want to suggest it he doesn't want to suggest it to this world no matter how nice it may be going for you he doesn't want us to be adjusted here I mean he wants us to fly we're gonna the church is gonna take a flight one of these days and then the bride is gonna be lifted off this earth hallelujah and each one has to exercise how when's your faith Amen that an Irish or damn bobbed off but they're long and flowing and beautiful amen he got power and those wings to fly no it's just a little eagle she's done that purposely so he wouldn't get adjusted to that nest he's an eagle he's not a chicken she wanted him to get out of there so he can trust his own so after a while he just can't sit down it's at that time of life of this person saying this and this is going on here and and and you're jumping around the nest because there's no comfortable son and I thought this is the one and what's all going on what's happening the nest is being stood up and you're hopping around from from one stick to to another stick to another branch and huh and then well there's a purpose for at all he wants you to fly he doesn't want you in the nest the nest is not the end of it's not your destination just a sit cook there and not use your wings and let everyone else take care of it I mean there comes a time when everyone has to supply their their gift to the body and it's not what I can get what can I give I mean that's how it has to be you can't just sit back and say well this person doesn't do this and this doesn't know what can you give this is what the every gift in the body if one has a gift in the body and that gift is not for you it's for others and the gift of them is not for themselves as for others and you have to be God God doesn't want us to be a bunch of individuals he wants us to work together as a body but pride will keep us as an individual amen I prayed God just go down into every heart just now pride is such a stops us so much we can be proud in our self-pity amen we can be proud of our pour me pour me pour me and what is that you just want anyone to look at you no there's no reason to finger pull me oh yeah oh poor me yeah poor poor you Jesus died for you I'll pour you that he took all your sins away I'll pour you he's reserved a place in heaven for you I'll pour you he's giving you the power to overcome healthy from the ground I'll pour you the peoples under your feet I'll pour you that's so terrible I feel so sorry for you right now hallelujah poor but we look at our situation this thing stirred up he wants you to fly and this person looked at me funny in this person didn't even look at me funny and poor me poor me yeah poor you you've got a rapture oh poor you there's no tribulation for you idea well we just have one big pity party but if you begin to look at it that way no you're sorry should turn into joy hallelujah Lord you have my life under control I don't want to hold anything back I don't want any pride to stop you dealing with me I mean I want to soar with you you have called me to soar with you I mean that's why that's why I believe we're having this kind of service God doesn't want to suck on the earth he wants this flight with him I need to see you win to say here I come daddy here I come to soar with you hallelujah brother Brandon preaches a swim in the countdown and he shows thee you could say the the evolution of technology matches what God is doing in the spirit realm a seed it began just with the horse and buggy just with like now I may get this rhombus like Luther or Weasley horse-and-buggy age and then there was the auto mirror yeah that was Luther than the Ottoman order of mobile age with vo with cars and everything that was that was Wesley then the Pentecostals was now the airplane age where where people begin to fly but they were so so now they're off the ground hallelujah you're like manifesting and so the spreading poured out amen but they're still being dictated to by the atmosphere amen of Lee what's the weather conditions doing it's too windy I'll stay down here the head of my plane is going to crash amen but he said that's not the end of it now we're in the astronaut age I mean when we go above the effects of this world through the atmosphere of this world probably even to a place where all things are possible hallelujah that's where we're cool to be and man is trying to leave the planet I mean it's because there will be a people leaving the planet one of these days but they're not going to Mars they're going to heaven hallelujah so the technology is this to the murmur of what God is doing but we're not meant to imagine imagine someone pull up at a horse-and-buggy here you'd say buddy you back in the back in the whatever eh but they're like no I'm justified by faith hallelujah God's dealing with me but they just in a horse and buggy but you've been up in space and you just come back down here to say it's wonderful up there and God gave me the rocket to go hallelujah and I've seen things you don't know nothing about come one little how many horsepower you got well I've got one horse I got one horsepower and then someone pulls up in a car and they look at and you and you look at them say why are you still worth pound you're still stuck in nearly 100 years ago what do you mean no better than this guy I've been sanctified I've been clean since it apart hallelujah that's good but don't stay here and then someone comes in an airplane and a little sister flying around and they're having a glorious time up there and they begin to come back and say do you know what Wellington looks like from from up there I've seen and it's wonderful and about you know and then but then you're looking at them saying an airplane get with it me you got to come into the space age hallelujah but what do you mean I've received the gift of the Spirit God's pulled out a spirit again we got the spiritual gifts working praise the Lord Azusa Street amen but we're not meant to be back there don't just stay back this being justified or sanctified I mean be filled the Holy Spirit hallelujah to become an astronaut hallelujah and then and then you meet another astronaut and you can have some real fellowship I mean you can you can talk with them nice fire but when it comes to being in space oh my good say yeah that wasn't you know you talk about all the geez you got to suffer and whatever you got and then you see that and you know the acceleration as you go lifts off within a year you can't talk about that with a piston with a horse and buggy you say what do you mean going up there Missy can we get there Missy says no you know but don't stay with the horse and buggy don't just stay just being justified by faith don't you stay justified and sanctified I mean be sealed under the kingdom become an astronaut God wants astronauts it's what he's looking for Alleluia now there comes a time but God has to stir up the nest and we get all upset things are going wrong and gods causing it gods causing it because he wants to see what you gonna do but there'll come a time and I pray it does come he's gonna push you out out of the nest out of your comfort zone this is how I am and this is always yeah a baby eagle all they knows the nest all they know they don't know what it's like to be up there just like a guy with BC the horse and buggy and you know whatever they all they know is that they don't know what it's like to be in space and but the thing is if there's something in them if there's something in that horse and buggy driver that's satisfied with the horse and buggy they'll stay there they may see how great it is and how wonderful it may be even see the rocket go up I mean you see the spirit fall on someone transform and make them into a new creature there's some going up into space hallelujah they may see that but they may say well it's not for me yeah that's a lie the devil that's a lie of the devil amen he doesn't want us to stay here with a horse and buggy he doesn't want us to stay in the nest he wants us to fly that's why we're made and Eagle is built to fly and Eagle is not built to hop around on a nest and Eagle is not a Kiwi bird hallelujah you know a New Zealand had the biggest eagle in the world had the biggest eagle in the world hallelujah we still have eagles amen but we're not meant to be used to catch more go looking deep opera it's got the talons and everything their massive thing oh yeah anyway um we but we're not mean to be like little Kiwis on the come out at night cause the sun's shining you know we want to be in the sunlight we want to be in the sunlight of God's Word hallelujah we don't want to be a little Kiwi but we're called to be Eagles so why stay in the knees then it comes a time now I just read this so now yep he's an eagle so he's ready to leave this leave the nest now he's dissatisfied with these old things of the world the first thing you know she said now if he's an eagle if he stays like that all the time he'll become a chicken because it's because it's like any muscles you know if you stop using it yeah if you don't use it you lose it amen and we won't go any further into that but anyway that's the same thing with like an eagle having big wings if they don't use those muscles they'll lose the ability it's in them to fly but they need to exercise their wings Alleluia so that's why he'll become like a chicken so I've got to get him out of here give him some experience then she comes over to the nest she spreads out of great big wings oh you ought to see it my some of them Eagles stretch 14 feet from tip to tip she had throw them big wings out like the Sinhala what a big scream like that she had waved them big wings them little Eagles lay back like this that wind Fanning like that then she she's brush them big wings out like that he says that's what the matter is the church today it needs a goodness stirring to get some of these loose feathers out of it maybe we want to fly out of its wings packing a chip on your on your shoulders and grudges and things like that you'll die in the flight that's a loose feather what's a grudge just a bit of unforgiveness as I said before that person looked at me funny this person didn't say hello to me this person thinks this and you put them in a box and there they are they're in liberal they're legal there whatever more and you're actually just carrying a chip on your shoulder you'll die in the flight I want to fly in the flight don't you I don't want to die I wasn't built to crash and burn I was built to soar Alleluia how can God ever have a church with signs and wonders and miracles when they're fussing one another unless I'm there and grudges grudges and everything founded up the Holy Ghost comes down like a rushing Mighty Wind fan all the differences and denominationalism and all those little loose feathers I'm les and I met you're nothing that you ought to be what the scripture said found out all the loose feathers oh my get them all tighten up because she's going to take them on a real ride pretty soon a solo oh my that solo flight the first one then she fans out of fans all the feathers out and then this just boils like that the loose feathers are flying everywhere get all the feathers flying up so they get real tight ones in there and she examines them over to see if they're ready and now there comes a point now where the mother takes the babies and puts them on her back and because they've got a hook in their bill they can hook around the around where the feather attaches to the body of the mother eagle and she lifts them up on their great big wings that's what God wants to do he doesn't want you in a nest I didn't I didn't birth you into this kingdom to keep you in a nests I brought you into this kingdom that you'll fly with me and then so she picks them up she flies up into the heavenlies and we're at the right altitude she doesn't say now hold on tight she just flips around and then they lose their grip and then now they're flying and there comes a point where maybe the mother Eagle I remember the babies they have confidence in mama because they've seen mama how she can fly hallelujah but she she shakes them off because now they've got to really really use those wings and once upon time they are standing on this thing look at me I can fly they're just standing there not even moving but now they're up in the air hallelujah this is where some of you are this morning now you're up in the air and you're flopping your wings about you just got to sit them Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm the Lord other heels all my diseases I'm my comforter I am my peace trust in my word God I just believe my word have faith in my word hallelujah and and in the mother's circling around them just like the Holy Ghost is circling around us holy as we're trying to get our wings just right amen and then she sweeps under there and catches them up again holy and lifts them up into the cliff to the raft hallelujah this is what our God wants to do I mean we're not earthbound creatures don't be stuck gonna don't be stuck in a in a cage of a you know a cage of Lies cage of unbelief amen as he said you know unbelief as the son it just it just manifests in a different way I mean dressing ungodly it's not the sinister unbelief smoking drinking it's not the actus the unbelief that causes those things God doesn't want us down in a chicken coop he doesn't we're not built you say well I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm about to close his brother car Jerry would maybe say he doesn't want to stack down on the earth just walking around while I believe the message and this is wonderful God's in a Providence you know and I can quote it back the front he wants it to be lived he doesn't just want he does he just doesn't want the illegals and nesting oh yes I think they can fly and it looks like they can fly in here they can yeah Oh yep yep they're my children and they look like me and he says now I want to prove it now I want to prove it than they like me and so he takes you up takes you up into the heavenlies checks you off parlor it stirs up an inch amen that you'll begin to fly and you'll come a point where where where the wings will Isis maneuver now they get their coordinator I mean you get a real balance in the word Alan yeah you're not unbalanced oh that's yeah oh that's being legal in you flew you bringing one wing and you big enough well like this and then you said about all that's liberal and you flip like this you're falling falling for he doesn't want you like that hey yeah Brother Bear me told the story of when he is in a storm and then there was a little chipmunk came out and am I gonna go chatta chatta chatta chatta and he's and he's looking around like lord why have you got me here to to look at this thing and they noticed this this little chipmunk you know it's not looking at him with this gun it's looking an eagle that's been blind down into the storm and he'll comes out with great big wings and the and the chipmunk chatter chatter chatter you know days of miracles as fast gods not real it's all in your head you know and then this great big Eagles there and this chipmunk yeah there's a waist there's a way so you know the devil always bring someone in to say no it's not true it doesn't really work and yeah that's chipmunks you know called it me a chipmunk or a squirrel whatever it is just some some little rodent that climbs a tree you know called me there and then and in this chip max looking of this eagle and this eagle comes out of the out of the bushes a great big wings and then brother bands got this gun because he's he's hunting he you know he's not gonna shoot the eagle cuz he cuz he admires it but that Eagles don't even scared of her because Eagles got confidence in his wings hallelujah and now before all this is happening brother Bram's dancing around the tree going hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah even he's having a time in the and the in the you know and the wilderness you know you know with God and then I was told sir someone's him when he was relaying that story you know preaching it he began to dance around the poop was like it was a tree hallelujah we should be free hey

with its great wings get up hallelujah and he knows the Eagles not scared of the hunter with the gun we shouldn't be afraid of the devil why should we be scared of her I've God is greater than than than any enemy any weapon formed against he shall not prosper we don't need to be afraid oh he'll get me no you gotta have confidence in your wing amen and then before in York amen the Eagle sittest wings I mean flew up into the heavenlies and he's seen Eagle when they get a certain height they just sit there wings you've even seen it but you sit and they just glide glide gliding that climb and they off they go that's incredible it's not like these seagulls here these vermin of the sky China we're not called to be like that let's eat our wings I mean our balance in the scripture once your balance is there it's not legal liberal lot what does your would say grace is fallen upon me and there's a reflection of it in my life hallelujah and you set your wings and then finally when you're
