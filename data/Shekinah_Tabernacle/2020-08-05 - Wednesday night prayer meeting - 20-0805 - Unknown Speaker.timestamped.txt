[32:08] they wandered in the wilderness in a
[32:10] solitary way
[32:11] we're just in a bubble to ourselves
[32:13] going around about and
[32:15] in a wilderness they found no city to
[32:17] dwell in
[32:18] couldn't find a place where we fit in
[32:19] hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in
[32:21] them then they cried unto the lord in
[32:23] their trouble
[32:24] and he delivered them out of all their
[32:25] distresses hallelujah
[32:28] and he led them forth by the right way
[32:29] that i might go to a city of habitation
[32:32] oh that men would praise the lord for
[32:34] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[32:37] to the children of men for he satisfied
[32:40] the longing soul and filleth the hungry
[32:43] soul
[32:43] with goodness who can testify to that
[32:46] verse
[32:47] hallelujah amen such as sit in darkness
[32:50] and in the shadow of death being bound
[32:52] in affliction
[32:53] and iron because they rebelled against
[32:55] the words of the lord and condemned the
[32:57] council of the most high
[32:59] therefore he brought down their heart
[33:00] with labor they fell down and there was
[33:02] none to help
[33:03] then they cried unto the lord in their
[33:05] trouble and he saved them
[33:06] out of their distresses he brought them
[33:09] out of the darkness in the shadow of
[33:11] death and break their bands
[33:12] in sunder oh that men would praise the
[33:15] lord for his goodness
[33:16] and for his wonderful works to the
[33:18] children of men
[33:20] hallelujah now we're gonna we could just
[33:22] keep reading but you know
[33:24] we've got to find a place to get off
[33:25] somewhere and we're going to go to
[33:27] deuteronomy chapter 4
[33:29] and we're going to read verses 7 and 8.
[33:38] deuteronomy 4 and verses 7 and 8.
[33:44] amen um yeah it's good to be a believer
[33:47] isn't it amen
[33:49] pretty good amen yeah i think i
[33:52] i can't remember who said it originally
[33:53] i think maybe brother blue kennedy did
[33:55] but you know um christine's granddad
[33:56] brother kevin says all this in heaven
[33:58] too
[33:59] you know so you know we get all this and
[34:00] heaven too so it's pretty good down here
[34:02] it's gonna be way better up there but
[34:03] yeah all this in heaven too
[34:05] sometimes we just need to look at what
[34:07] really the main thing is you know
[34:08] there's many things we look at with our
[34:10] five senses and there's trouble and
[34:12] the world's just like a drunken man's
[34:14] teetering along
[34:15] and craziness but you know we have a
[34:18] sure word of prophecy
[34:20] holy you know we know where we're going
[34:21] we know where we came from and no and we
[34:23] know who we are
[34:24] amen and we know where our god is that's
[34:26] the main thing amen deuteronomy
[34:28] 4 chapter 4 verses 7 and 8. for what
[34:31] nation this is this is moses
[34:33] and his part of his last address to the
[34:35] children of israel before the lord takes
[34:36] him home
[34:37] for what nation is there so great who
[34:40] hath god so
[34:41] nigh unto them now to me the reason
[34:44] they're such a great people is because
[34:45] god is so nice so close unto them as the
[34:48] lord our god is in all things
[34:50] that we call upon him for and what
[34:53] nation is there so great that has

[36:02] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[36:06] bless you friends you may have your
[36:07] seats
[36:07] uh tonight but if i could just
[36:11] have a you know give a bit of a thought
[36:12] tonight i just want to talk about you
[36:14] know
[36:15] how great is our god how great is his
[36:18] word
[36:19] you know brother bram you know a a a
[36:21] woman would
[36:22] would come to him and he would he would
[36:24] uh you know bring this up from time to
[36:26] time where
[36:27] where you know she would say you know
[36:28] brother brown there's one thing i hold
[36:30] against you
[36:31] you know you preach pretty well but
[36:32] there's one thing and and then brother
[36:34] and thought well
[36:35] obviously i found grace in your sight
[36:37] and then he then she said you know the
[36:38] problem i have with you
[36:40] with you is you brag on jesus too much
[36:43] and there's a brother abraham said well
[36:44] i hope that's what the
[36:45] the only thing that the lord holds
[36:46] against me i mean because we know that
[36:48] the lord you know jesus christ is god
[36:50] himself
[36:51] so she would say that's the problem you
[36:52] bet you brag on jesus too much and i
[36:55] think in reality we can never brag on
[36:57] our lord too much
[36:58] amen he's so great he's so wonderful
[37:01] amen he's so merciful he's full of grace
[37:03] amen he's full of love
[37:05] he's full of judgment he's full of peace
[37:06] he's full of all things
[37:08] hallelujah i mean all things that are
[37:09] good amen and and we should just rejoice
[37:12] amen in our lord
[37:19] israel as we read there in deuteronomy 4
[37:21] for what nation
[37:22] is there so great who hath god so
[37:25] nigh unto them as the lord our god and
[37:29] all things that we call
[37:30] upon him for now if you just think about
[37:32] where they were standing in that day
[37:34] you know god was god was with them but
[37:37] god could never be in them you know even
[37:39] when
[37:40] god was about to come down on mount
[37:41] sinai and give the word to moses
[37:43] you know god instructed moses tell the
[37:45] people set a boundary around the base of
[37:47] the mountain
[37:48] no one's allowed on the mountain not
[37:49] even their animals if they do they're
[37:51] going to be killed so
[37:52] when god would came down on the mountain
[37:54] there was actually a gap a separation
[37:56] amen between the people and god but yet
[38:00] moses is saying
[38:01] how great is this people that god is so
[38:04] nigh unto them
[38:05] now we know that that back in the old
[38:07] testament it was death
[38:09] i mean to to to go into the prince of
[38:11] the pillar of fire
[38:12] unless you've been invited but now we
[38:14] know it's death not to go in
[38:16] i mean because beforehand under the
[38:18] blood of bulls and goats only a few
[38:20] people could go into that presence like
[38:22] the high priest once a year into the
[38:23] holy of holies and moses we know went up
[38:25] into the you know
[38:27] you know into the mountain but but under
[38:29] the blood of jesus christ i mean god is
[38:31] not just a distance now
[38:32] but god comes and dwells in his people
[38:35] where now we become the living dwelling
[38:37] place of the living god
[38:38] hallelujah so we could yo so i could
[38:41] actually say now
[38:42] how great is this
[38:46] because we know that we are we weren't a
[38:48] people but now we are a people
[38:50] i mean we weren't a nation but now we
[38:51] are a holy nation a royal priesthood as
[38:53] the scripture tells us
[38:54] so now we are the bride as a nation
[38:57] hallelujah we have the passport
[39:00] i mean we have our birth certificate
[39:01] proving that we are
[39:03] born again amen we're genuine sons and
[39:05] daughters of god
[39:06] hallelujah amen you know we you know we
[39:09] we we have a nation hallelujah we are a
[39:12] holy nation in this hour
[39:14] amen but you know it's incredible
[39:16] because even even you know if you look
[39:18] at what jesus would say about john the
[39:19] baptist
[39:20] he would say there is no greater prophet
[39:22] like him and he's talk and he's looking
[39:24] back through the old testament
[39:25] but he said the least in the kingdom of
[39:27] god is greater than john
[39:29] now why was that because john was the
[39:31] last prophet under the old dispensation
[39:33] of blood of bulls and goats
[39:34] it could only bring him to a certain
[39:36] level in christ right because the blood
[39:37] of bulls and gods could never bring a
[39:39] people to be joint heir
[39:40] with god himself but under the blood of
[39:43] jesus christ we're actually elevated
[39:45] above the old testament believer
[39:47] in our position in christ and we are now
[39:49] joint heirs with christ hallelujah
[39:51] i mean we are not you could say
[39:53] second-class citizens but we are joint
[39:55] ears with
[39:56] our king i mean and that's what he wants
[39:58] he doesn't want his bride
[39:59] way down somewhere he wants his bride
[40:01] lifted up to where he is
[40:04] hallelujah so even he would tell the
[40:06] disciples in john
[40:08] 14 he would say behold i go and prepare
[40:10] a place for you
[40:12] and if i go again wait let's just let's
[40:14] just read that shall we john john 14.
[40:17] let not your heart be troubled don't be
[40:19] troubled in this day
[40:21] don't let your heart be troubled that
[40:23] tells me you can let your heart be
[40:25] troubled
[40:26] but don't let it be troubled hallelujah
[40:29] amen you believe in god believe also on
[40:31] me
[40:32] in my father's house in many mansions if
[40:34] or not so i would have told you
[40:36] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[40:39] go and prepare a place for you i will
[40:41] come again and receive you unto myself
[40:43] that where i am not where you are but
[40:46] where i am you shall be also
[40:48] and whether i go you know and the way
[40:50] you know
[40:52] so jesus is saying that i'm gonna go
[40:54] prepare a place for you i'm basically
[40:55] just rehashing what we just read
[40:57] i'm gonna go prepare a place for you and
[40:59] if i do i'll come again and receive you
[41:00] unto myself that where i am in that next
[41:02] dimension
[41:03] you know this message was a voice from
[41:05] another world
[41:06] you know this message wasn't a voice
[41:08] from kentucky it was a voice from
[41:09] another world
[41:10] brother ram would be standing there and
[41:12] he'd say i'm standing in two worlds
[41:13] right now
[41:14] he was staying there in front of the
[41:15] people but he said he was looking he was
[41:17] seeing visions as he was talking to
[41:19] people on the platform he says i'm
[41:20] standing in two worlds
[41:22] and he saw things that happened years
[41:24] ago amen
[41:25] and he saw things that were going to
[41:26] happen in the future where was he
[41:28] standing
[41:30] he was standing in another world so this
[41:32] message was actually
[41:34] a a voice from another world it was from
[41:36] glory i believe
[41:38] highly it wasn't from it wasn't from
[41:40] hell it wasn't from the reasons of the
[41:41] lost it was from glory
[41:43] i mean it was the lord jesus coming down
[41:45] to receive a people
[41:46] unto himself now we must be very very
[41:49] clear
[41:51] the reason that moses could say the
[41:54] people were so great is because god
[41:56] gathered them
[41:57] it wasn't them boasting look at me yeah
[42:00] i'm a son or daughter of abraham
[42:02] no no god made them great god called
[42:04] them out
[42:05] god justified them god set them free
[42:08] from slavery
[42:09] god washed them hallelujah god called
[42:11] them that was god's doing it wasn't
[42:13] their doing
[42:14] you know moses tried it himself he just
[42:16] killed one egyptian
[42:18] and that was that was his success
[42:20] pointed to one dead body in the sand ran
[42:22] away as a runaway prophet that was his
[42:23] success
[42:24] but when god got a hold of him
[42:26] hallelujah that same one just just shook
[42:28] that whole nation and brought out
[42:30] god's people he fulfilled the word for
[42:32] his life so you know the reason they
[42:34] were great is because god was among them
[42:36] god chose to be among them they didn't
[42:38] choose god to be among them god chose
[42:40] to be among them and it's the same thing
[42:42] with you and i god chose
[42:44] to come and dwell on you god choose to
[42:46] call you amen it wasn't you calling you
[42:48] seeking it was god
[42:49] amen they chose to call you hallelujah
[42:51] it was god that chose to turn your heart
[42:53] it was god that said i want to get that
[42:55] person's attention and i'm going gonna
[42:57] get their attention
[42:58] and what's god doing it wasn't you doing
[43:00] it was he doing
[43:01] you know brother brown would say oh
[43:03] people say i sought god i saw god no no
[43:05] no the pattern is always god seeks man
[43:09] man recognizes he's a sinner and he runs
[43:12] and he will run into the world or he'll
[43:14] become religious and try and justify his
[43:16] fallen nature
[43:17] by a whole bunch of scripture and that's
[43:20] the biggest barricade that needs to be
[43:21] bursted through
[43:22] because hey i came out of the world i
[43:24] knew i was lost and undone
[43:26] i didn't have a leg to stand on and the
[43:28] one leg i had to stand up i thought was
[43:30] i i never
[43:31] ended up in prison killed anyone shot
[43:32] anyone you know but then god came along
[43:35] in a dream said no
[43:35] your righteousness is filthy rags boy
[43:38] you know
[43:39] so it's wonderful when you realize man
[43:42] i'm i'm toast without him because at
[43:45] least at least you've got a starting
[43:46] point right
[43:47] but then when you come to the other side
[43:49] of that when you surrender your whole
[43:52] life to him
[43:53] amen and you give your whole being to
[43:55] him and he changes you like only he can
[43:58] holy then you're standing on the other
[43:59] side you can say i'm as righteous
[44:02] as god is righteous i'm as holy as god
[44:05] as holy
[44:06] i'm as justified as god is justified why
[44:09] because the scripture says he became
[44:10] sin amen right he he became sin that i'd
[44:14] become the risers of god in christ
[44:16] hallelujah so i hope that's not too
[44:19] shocking but it's true
[44:20] if i'm under the blood i'm under the
[44:22] blood amen
[44:23] hallelujah amen amen so i i just want to
[44:27] ask you know when we really think about
[44:29] it
[44:30] is there any ever been a people since
[44:33] you could say the book of acts
[44:35] where god is so nice to them has there
[44:38] ever been a people where god is so close
[44:41] where we're not living looking at the
[44:44] promise of a restoration
[44:46] in the future but we're living in it
[44:49] you know people before azusa street they
[44:52] actually
[44:53] they actually saw in the scripture
[44:54] there'd come a time when the holy ghost
[44:56] would be pulled out again
[44:58] they actually said it was going to
[44:59] happen again what they read about in the
[45:02] book of acts was going to happen again
[45:04] hallelujah they actually would read
[45:06] about a restoration they would have a
[45:08] longing
[45:08] but they weren't they weren't living in
[45:10] the season of that full restoration
[45:13] now we know we've gone past azusa street
[45:14] because we now have the giver himself
[45:16] we've gone back to the book of acts
[45:18] pentecost but there was a hunger in
[45:20] people's hearts
[45:21] they wanted to see a restoration
[45:24] and we're living in that season god
[45:26] allotted this
[45:27] their portion of time then but god's
[45:29] allotted our portion of time
[45:31] now hallelujah so so has it ever been
[45:34] do we do we know what we have this day
[45:37] do we really recognize we're not just
[45:39] justified by faith like luthor
[45:42] still still smoking pipe drinking beer
[45:44] brought a whole bunch of catholicism
[45:46] with them under the you know
[45:47] you're in that sardis age have a name
[45:49] but you're dead because they had their
[45:50] own name of a church
[45:52] you know or even under the wesleyan
[45:54] movement
[45:56] do we you know do do you really do we
[45:59] really recognize
[46:00] what we have in him
[46:03] you know we have all things we don't
[46:06] just have a partial restoration
[46:08] you know when brother ram would stand
[46:09] there and preach it's the restoration of
[46:11] the bride tree
[46:12] hallelujah and then he would go to
[46:14] ezekiel's dry bones
[46:16] and you go about the four stages of
[46:17] restoration and he'd say about you know
[46:20] then finally because there comes that
[46:21] part in ezekiel's dry bones where
[46:23] the skin's on the flesh is on but they
[46:25] don't have any life for them
[46:27] but then but then ezekiel said prophesy
[46:29] son of man
[46:30] amen and that prophet began to prophesy
[46:32] they got up like a mighty army life came
[46:34] into them
[46:35] and he said oh if i just had time to go
[46:37] into ezekiel's drive bones we said
[46:39] prophesy son of man
[46:40] what had to happen there had to be
[46:42] malachi 4 upon the earth
[46:43] i mean that god could actually fulfill
[46:45] that scripture through a prophet on the
[46:47] earth that could release a word of life
[46:50] hallelujah upon a people we were not
[46:52] just a bunch of bones on the ground
[46:55] or even them come together or even just
[46:56] flesh on the body but now we're standing
[46:58] up
[46:59] waka's life has come in hallelujah and
[47:03] if you think about that scene
[47:04] could those dry bones say i'm going to
[47:07] come back to life again
[47:08] no no they're in the valley they're just
[47:11] sitting there
[47:12] and here we were in this world
[47:16] i don't know where you were but i was a
[47:17] place and it was dry
[47:20] no life in me desert hallelujah
[47:25] but when god looked down remember it's
[47:27] god's choosing
[47:29] you say well that's not fair to everyone
[47:30] else i'm just happy i'm in
[47:32] you know that's how i view it i'm just
[47:34] glad he called me
[47:35] and i just hope the honey will spread on
[47:37] some other people amen and they'll begin
[47:39] to lick and rejoice and taste and see
[47:41] the lord is good
[47:42] hallelujah so why are you happy how can
[47:45] i not be happy
[47:47] we live in a time of trouble the world's
[47:48] falling apart it has to fall apart it
[47:51] will get worse it must get worse it's
[47:52] prophesied to get worse
[47:54] but we have our ticket out of here i
[47:57] mean we have our ticket
[47:59] if you've got the holy ghost on the
[48:00] inside of the inside of you you're
[48:01] carrying your token
[48:03] holly you can't drop it you know who's
[48:05] ever been
[48:06] you know you can't fly overseas well you
[48:08] probably can now but it's pretty hard
[48:09] but
[48:10] who's ever sat in a departure lounge and
[48:12] you check where your ticket is
[48:14] you check where your passport is five
[48:16] minutes later you check where your
[48:17] ticket is
[48:18] you check where your passport is you go
[48:19] sit a bit closer to the gate you check
[48:20] your ticket
[48:21] you check you know i don't need to do
[48:23] that
[48:24] i can't lose it we're sealed into the
[48:27] day of our redemption
[48:28] i can't lose my ticket hallelujah
[48:31] amen so i was in a dry place but god saw
[48:34] this potential in those bones
[48:37] i didn't see any potential in me but god
[48:39] saw potential
[48:40] just like all of us i mean all the all
[48:42] the seed of god wherever they are
[48:44] hallelujah
[48:44] you may still be a bone on the ground
[48:46] but i'll say god sees potential in you
[48:48] i remember if you just cry out say god
[48:51] hallelujah i don't want to stay in this
[48:53] condition
[48:55] amen and we're just going to skip
[48:56] through that but you know we're standing
[48:58] up as a mighty army right now
[49:01] i once was dead but now i live i was
[49:03] once blind but now i see
[49:06] amen so do we know where we're standing
[49:09] where's god brought us we're not you
[49:12] know
[49:14] brother bram says that a bridegroom call
[49:17] will come right through this
[49:20] it's a call to a marriage
[49:24] and it's not just people to fill in at
[49:26] the reception
[49:28] this is not the lord saying well i've
[49:30] got so many seats seats of the wedding
[49:31] supper
[49:32] i need to fill and then go look at
[49:34] extended family third cousin twice

[49:37] the weird uncle bob that you wouldn't
[49:38] you know you know those friends from
[49:40] school you know
[49:41] that's not how it works it's all the
[49:43] same category of people
[49:45] it's all bright kind of people
[49:47] hallelujah it's not it's not even
[49:50] it's not even maids of honor and you
[49:52] know flower girls no no bride
[49:55] this message is a bridegroom call
[49:58] hallelujah
[49:59] all the same category of people is
[50:01] called hallelujah
[50:03] amen hallelujah that's why i ask you
[50:06] do you know where you're standing and
[50:08] yeah many times we look in the mirror
[50:09] and we say how can i ever make it
[50:11] because there's a war within and without
[50:13] we know
[50:14] right that's why when there's a body
[50:16] change hallelujah
[50:18] hallelujah you know we're going to be
[50:20] happy when this thing's changed
[50:23] but just because there's battles going
[50:24] on doesn't mean amen that
[50:27] that that we are not believers
[50:30] now hopefully i can find this scripture
[50:32] but i'm just gonna let's go to
[50:34] philippians

[50:47] philippians 1 and 28.
[50:55] you know who's oh yeah yeah brother
[50:58] ahmad says it turn your frown upside
[50:59] down and give your face a rest
[51:02] it takes more muscles to frown than to
[51:04] smile
[51:05] so let's be happy and look it uses less
[51:08] energy
[51:11] you know the real lazy ones among us
[51:12] should be smiling
[51:16] anyway and nothing
[51:19] yes and nothing terrified by your
[51:23] adversaries
[51:25] which is to them an evident token of
[51:28] perdition
[51:29] but to you of salvation and that
[51:32] of god so don't be terrified by
[51:36] your adversaries i've got this mime
[51:38] battle
[51:39] i've got this sickness i've got this
[51:41] trouble don't be trouble can you can you
[51:43] just leave that up
[51:47] don't be terrified by them
[51:51] which is to them an evident token of
[51:52] perdition
[51:54] had the devils the devil's picked aside
[51:57] we picked the side too
[51:59] and him coming against us is just
[52:00] evidence where he's going and where he's
[52:02] from
[52:03] right but to you of salvation why
[52:06] because if the devil has someone he just
[52:07] has them and he leaves them alone he
[52:09] prospers them
[52:10] gives them a little kingdom can be very
[52:12] big can be very small depends what kind
[52:14] of price he puts on the gift in their
[52:15] life
[52:17] yep he'll give you
[52:20] well we've all been on the auction block
[52:24] right and the devil's bid and god has
[52:27] bid
[52:28] but the thing is we get to choose who we
[52:30] get sold to
[52:33] remember the higher the value of a soul
[52:35] the more the devil will try and give
[52:37] them
[52:39] right but the thing is there comes a
[52:41] point where actually
[52:42] if you just let the bidding war go
[52:43] higher and higher and higher
[52:45] the devil says i can't match that bit
[52:47] amen
[52:48] hallelujah he can't match the bit of the
[52:50] blood why because you've got to look at
[52:52] now
[52:53] what can i get what can i get from the
[52:56] devil
[52:56] can i receive eternal life can i receive
[53:00] peace for my soul
[53:01] can i receive forgiveness of sins so he
[53:05] has nothing to give me
[53:07] right he can't give me heaven amen he
[53:11] can't give me a rapture
[53:13] he can't give me overcoming power not
[53:15] that he want to give it because he wants
[53:16] us to be mashed down under
[53:17] his control but he has nothing to give
[53:20] me
[53:21] hallelujah but anyway which is to them
[53:24] an evident token of perdition but to you
[53:25] of salvation and that of god
[53:28] so don't be terrified of your
[53:29] adversaries
[53:32] hallelujah i think that i thought that
[53:34] was pretty cool
[53:36] you know are the enemies against me well
[53:38] that's actually a token of your
[53:40] salvation
[53:41] that's proof that actually you have
[53:42] something the devil wants but you're not
[53:44] giving it to him
[53:45] even because you've already given it to
[53:46] someone else which is the lord jesus
[53:48] christ
[53:49] hallelujah amen see as i said if the
[53:52] devil
[53:53] you know if he's got you he just leaves
[53:55] you alone really because you you know
[53:56] because you become
[53:57] coercive to what he wants but if you
[54:00] have something that he wants that you
[54:01] won't give him he's going to come
[54:03] against you
[54:04] because he knows the potential
[54:07] of the sons and daughters of god he saw
[54:10] adam in the garden said tree come here
[54:12] lion come here window here he saw the
[54:14] power
[54:15] of the sons of god in in in his dominion
[54:19] he saw moses come into egypt as a
[54:21] serpent bruiser
[54:22] and he saw him bring the children of
[54:23] israel out he saw joshua say
[54:25] sun stancil moonstand still how he saw
[54:28] that
[54:29] he saw rahab bring her family in
[54:32] he saw ruth coming hallelujah
[54:36] he saw joseph amen do what he did to the
[54:38] santa cruz
[54:39] yeah your prosperity yo in egypt he saw
[54:42] elijah shut the heavens
[54:44] he saw he saw the son of god conquer all
[54:48] things
[54:50] hallelujah he saw it and he reads the
[54:53] same bible you read in the and this
[54:55] bible tells me
[54:56] that we're to be like jesus as he
[54:59] overcome will overcome
[55:01] as he conquered we are more than
[55:03] conquerors to him that loved us
[55:05] so the devil sees the potential of the
[55:07] sons and daughters of god and that's why
[55:09] he fights you
[55:11] but if we could just recognize what god
[55:13] has made us because of who he is not
[55:15] because of who we are but because of who
[55:16] he is
[55:17] hallelujah remember this the whole plan
[55:19] of redemption is resting upon him
[55:22] amen hallelujah it's not resting upon
[55:24] you and i
[55:25] sure god uses man to work his program
[55:27] out but ultimately it's his
[55:29] program if you know if we turn the call
[55:32] down he's got someone else will do it
[55:37] i'm glad we didn't have a rejoicing amen
[55:38] just out of that
[55:41] you know but you know that's god's
[55:43] program
[55:45] as i said a few sundays ago putting that
[55:47] picture up at boaz by the gate ruth
[55:49] isn't there
[55:50] ruth's not in the picture it's him doing
[55:52] it
[55:54] hallelujah so has there ever been a
[55:57] people
[55:58] i don't i don't want to be too long and
[56:00] and i'll just finish with this but
[56:02] has there ever been a people where god
[56:04] is so close to them
[56:06] closer than your next breath hallelujah
[56:09] i'll be with you even in you to the end
[56:11] of the world
[56:12] hallelujah isn't it amazing that we can
[56:16] just come into his presence
[56:18] the prophets of old longed
[56:21] to even just look into what you actually
[56:23] have right now
[56:25] they longed for this day daniel asked
[56:27] god when's it going to happen
[56:30] he says you stay in your lot the book
[56:32] sealed to the time of the end
[56:34] and here we are receiving an open book
[56:36] the book that was sealed has now come
[56:38] open
[56:39] hallelujah and now there's a people upon
[56:41] the earth
[56:42] that are blood washed remember the blood
[56:44] puts us on speaking terms
[56:46] that's why i put that by the door there
[56:47] i trust you read that when you walk in
[56:49] says the blood puts us in that condition
[56:52] puts us on speaking terms with god
[56:55] and here we come we can bow our heads
[57:00] and we can talk to our lord and he hears
[57:02] our prayer
[57:04] and he answers our prayers and his time
[57:06] according to
[57:07] to the good pleasure of his will and do
[57:10] you know that someone who's just met the
[57:12] lord five seconds ago
[57:13] has more authority with god than an
[57:15] archangel that never fell
[57:17] hallelujah gabriel or michael i'm just
[57:20] dramatizing they can be talking to the
[57:22] lord about something but then when one
[57:23] of us
[57:23] can be a little child they bow their
[57:25] head begin to talk to the lord
[57:27] the lord says shh my daughter's talking
[57:30] to me
[57:31] my son's talking to me they're more you
[57:33] know and he puts all of his attention on
[57:35] us
[57:38] isn't that wonderful
[57:41] amen so i think we should just
[57:45] finish there he hears our prayers
[57:49] has there ever been a people upon the
[57:50] earth like we happen to be
[57:54] never the book wasn't opened in paul's
[57:56] day it's open today
[57:58] it wasn't open in john's day it's open
[58:00] today he saw it but he's told to seal it
[58:02] up
[58:03] it wasn't open in luther's day martin's
[58:05] day wesley's day
[58:06] azusa street day it's open today
[58:10] hallelujah and what's it to do it says
[58:12] the
[58:13] brother brahm says that the seals
[58:15] opening it reveals christ
[58:18] there's been parts of him that have been
[58:19] hidden up since the world began
[58:22] and he's revealed himself to you
[58:27] that makes me feel about this big my
[58:30] fingers are together by the way
[58:32] it makes me feel this big that the lord
[58:34] would put us here in this moment
[58:37] and he put us our lives upon the earth
[58:39] to shake the kingdom of hell one more
[58:41] time
[58:41] to torment the devil just before the
[58:44] great tribulation
[58:45] and to not taste death has he ever been
[58:48] a people like
[58:49] us many people have longed to see the
[58:51] rapture they'll see it
[58:52] they'll be the dead in christ but
[58:54] they've longed to be alive and remain
[58:56] and we've known a few of them but
[58:58] they've died in faith
[59:00] hallelujah but we'll see them again as
[59:02] young young people
[59:04] and they'll tell us it's on and before
[59:07] we even know it our bodies will be
[59:09] changed
[59:10] oh my it's gonna happen
[59:14] you look the pa you just look at the
[59:15] past maybe 10 years
[59:18] it's been a time of refreshing has come
[59:20] from the presence of the lord
[59:22] the spirit of law has been poured out in
[59:24] greater ways
[59:26] greater reality what's happening it's
[59:28] going home time
[59:31] but he put you under the spout of his
[59:33] anointing
[59:34] because he wanted to fill you to
[59:37] overflowing
[59:38] he want to open his word to you so we
[59:41] can't look at the devil tells us you're
[59:43] not it you'll never make it you'll never
[59:45] overcome look at all these
[59:46] things he ain't my god
