[12:19] choice at the end of the service amen
[12:23] we're practicing now you know so the
[12:28] Lord I actually this came in a dream and

[12:37] to change
[12:38] amen I'm gonna not preach okay I'm just
[12:43] gonna tell you the poem have you ever
[12:46] seen a girl who's been teased all her
[12:49] life ever seen a little lady
[12:52] living in the strife of a fallen world
[12:55] knowing there's so much more for deep
[12:58] down inside she's born to be the bride
[13:01] all her surroundings everything that
[13:03] keeps her on the ground it's about to
[13:06] change
[13:09] she's about to leave this world leave
[13:12] everything behind she's looking
[13:14] everywhere because she's called to find
[13:17] more of her kind there's an atmosphere
[13:20] brewing in the ear it's kind of strange
[13:22] to this fallen world because it's all
[13:25] about to change
[13:26] I know of a lady she does not look like
[13:30] much in this world according to its
[13:32] pride she comes from God goes back to
[13:35] God she's thought of kind of strange she
[13:38] don't really fit in this world but it's
[13:40] all about to change
[13:42] she's about to leave this world leave
[13:44] everything behind she's looking
[13:46] everywhere because she
[13:47] being called to find more of a kind
[13:49] there's an atmosphere brewing in the air
[13:52] it's kind of strange to this fallen
[13:54] world because it's all about to change
[13:56] because of our Lord has named as
[13:59] glorious Jesus Christ coming down in
[14:01] perfect love to rescue me to change my
[14:04] life full of grace mercy never-ending
[14:07] praise everything my all blessed be your
[14:09] name for everything I see is about to
[14:12] change
[14:12] amen go play sure
[14:24] this song is a one that I've written and
[14:28] coming through
[14:41] this is a song that I wrote a while ago
[14:43] as we were I don't want to say too much
[14:45] but as we've been through our walk with
[14:48] the Lord and coming into the full
[14:50] revelation of this message and we
[14:52] realized that there was so much more
[14:54] whose heard an Eagle scream amen and
[14:58] that Eagle scream pulled you out of
[15:00] Egypt but that was only the start of
[15:02] your journey and so what I started to
[15:05] realize that there was this whole
[15:06] adoption process and one thing I wanted
[15:09] to say is that with this adoption you
[15:13] know when we've got so much power over
[15:15] the devil because what we found out was
[15:18] that we were wearing this wedding band
[15:20] of predestinated unmerited grace before
[15:23] the foundation of the world so I want to
[15:25] say if you're a believer you're neither
[15:27] where a child of the devil you were
[15:29] always a child of God and you're now
[15:31] growing and I realized that there was
[15:33] this process three stages to the
[15:35] adoption where we had to cross through
[15:37] the Red Sea and then we had to cross
[15:40] through the desert and then we come to
[15:41] the Jordan and beyond the Jordan there
[15:43] was a Canaan's land and it's ours and
[15:45] it's our promise for now and what I come
[15:49] to realize that there were message
[15:50] believers right from coming out of Egypt
[15:53] all the way to ones that had gone into
[15:54] the Promised Land now and a living and a
[15:56] bride aged and rejoicing but there's
[15:59] people right through there and I just
[16:00] had this desire in my heart to encourage
[16:03] those people to come into the fullness
[16:05] and to Kanaan's land so that was the
[16:08] inspiration for this song and I'm not
[16:10] much of a singer
[16:15] we were born into Egypt and bondage we
[16:23] had no peace at all for this Pharaoh no
[16:28] longer knew our Joseph all the power of
[16:35] our God but Jehovah has sent to us a
[16:40] Moses saying let my people go
[16:46] Satan no longer has a hold of us we are
[16:53] heading to the promised land we've been
[16:59] walking through the desert
[17:03] on our way to the promised land
[17:08] [Music]
[17:09] or a Moses he said that he would lead us
[17:14] if we will put a trust in him but the
[17:22] people did now trust and Moses you will
[17:27] have to make your choice where you will
[17:30] stand for jehovah is looking for the
[17:36] people who were looking for the promised
[17:41] land we are able to take the promised
[17:47] land
[17:49] Ford's yours the saith the Lord
[17:54] all he's promised a mighty host of
[17:58] angels to ban camp around them who fear
[18:04] his name
[18:05] and he said be strong I'll never leave
[18:10] you just put your trust in the one who
[18:14] lady's friend
[18:17] if you only just be courageous he's by
[18:23] your side
[18:25] combined for you and Joshua and Caleb
[18:31] who went into the land to see what they
[18:37] would have to fight against there were
[18:41] giants and Donnie's all kinds of mighty
[18:44] man horses and chariots walls around the
[18:50] land but Jehovah has said that we can
[18:55] take it the enemies of Israel will fall
[19:02] if we'll only trust him to lead us we
[19:08] can take
[19:10] the promised land
[19:13] but the people would not trust you hold
[19:19] theythey
[19:21] it of what would come they were looking
[19:27] back to Egypt fruits and water replace
[19:33] to lay their head
[19:35] and start is doubting
[19:39] their noses even though they gotta talk
[19:45] to him
[19:46] the hand for God and the things that
[19:50] he'd spoken we're able to take Canaan's
[19:56] land
[19:58] we're able to take the promised land
[20:04] towards you
[20:06] the Santa
[20:09] he's promised a mighty host of angels to
[20:16] vancamp around them who fit his name
[20:20] he said be strong I'll never leave you
[20:25] just put your trust in the one who
[20:29] ladies read
[20:31] if you only just be courageous he's by
[20:37] your side you find for you we must learn
[20:45] to trust the prophets for they have
[20:50] heard the will of God
[20:54] from the mouth the word has been spoken
[20:59] and we must obey their voice if we don't
[21:06] want to wander in the desert
[21:11] or perish then the shifting sands then
[21:16] stay connected to his message and the
[21:23] people heading to the promised land
[21:27] he has sent to us a message revealing
[21:35] the son of man
[21:38] crying come out of her my people God is
[21:45] given to you the promised land
[21:49] he has sent to us a message revealing
[21:57] the son of man
[22:00] crying come out of her my people God's
[22:07] given to you the promised land

[1:00:21] around when it comes to the things of
[1:00:24] God so I'm just want to say thank you

[1:00:46] brother Cobain and and brother Armand

[1:00:55] I love you know just sitting one-on-one
[1:00:58] and just just listen and you get to
[1:01:01] realize and you get to appreciate each
[1:01:04] other so much more you get to sit in New
[1:01:08] Year the testimonies all the believers
[1:01:11] in you you discover how a God has
[1:01:14] brought them from where they are today
[1:01:17] and you say Lord thank you so much
[1:01:20] because father I can identify with these
[1:01:24] testimonies and that's where I read the
[1:01:27] scripture tonight it says David says O
[1:01:30] God thou art my god so tonight I want to
[1:01:37] brag about my god
[1:01:40] these are loving reality to me
[1:01:44] personally he's done too much for me I
[1:01:48] cannot tell it all excuse me I just I
[1:01:53] get very enthused I gotta help her but
[1:01:57] he's done too much for me miss miss miss
[1:02:00] picked me from wherever I was he's
[1:02:03] picked me up from the band he's turned
[1:02:05] me around he checked me on the road
[1:02:09] toward my adoption it was my body change
[1:02:14] I love him and I don't just say it
[1:02:24] because I want you you know just to make
[1:02:26] you feel good I love my Jesus he sees an
[1:02:31] amazing chord
[1:02:33] he's a God by the island it can be
[1:02:36] touched by the feeling of your
[1:02:39] infirmities
[1:02:41] he's a God that knows when you go in
[1:02:46] through certain situations when you go
[1:02:49] in through certain trials when you go in
[1:02:52] through certain tests he's not a god
[1:02:56] that's on the outside that does not know
[1:03:00] what you going
[1:03:03] he's a god the Bible says that can be
[1:03:08] touched by the feeling of your
[1:03:13] infirmities he knows what it's like to
[1:03:18] get a headache so when you get a
[1:03:22] headache and he said Oh God
[1:03:25] help me heal me he knows what you going
[1:03:29] through he's a god that can be touched
[1:03:32] by the feeling of my infirmities and
[1:03:37] I've seen it I've experienced it I've
[1:03:42] got a quote here the deity of Jesus
[1:03:44] Christ but the blenheim talked he he
[1:03:47] talks about the blood of Jesus but he
[1:03:51] says he says because we know the Bible
[1:03:53] says God he's a spirit so he says
[1:03:56] talking about the blood he says how was
[1:03:59] it God's blood he says God has no blood
[1:04:03] how could it be because it was God's
[1:04:07] creative blood that he created in order
[1:04:12] to redeem us and came and loved in the
[1:04:17] same body that he created therefore now
[1:04:23] the Branham says God had to suffer but
[1:04:30] the Brennan says as God he couldn't
[1:04:32] suffer temptation but the Brennan says
[1:04:35] he had to suffer sexual temptation he
[1:04:41] had to suffer all kinds of temptation to
[1:04:46] be tempted by the devil in riches and
[1:04:49] power and Dominion and so forth
[1:04:54] to suffer all of that so that ye can be
[1:04:59] touched by the feeling of your
[1:05:03] infirmities so when you get tempted he
[1:05:08] knows he knows what it likes what it is
[1:05:12] like to be tempted and that is why he's
[1:05:16] a god that can come down to whatever
[1:05:22] whether it's a little child that's my
[1:05:26] god he can come and you can meet that
[1:05:29] little child at the level that let
[1:05:33] little child ease with him he can come
[1:05:37] and he can meet the minister at the
[1:05:40] level that the minister is with him he
[1:05:44] can come with a deacon with you the
[1:05:46] pasta he can meet you at your feet and
[1:05:56] you know what he's a god that loves he's
[1:06:01] a God that forgives that's my god
[1:06:07] revising I failed God so me know I was
[1:06:11] testifying to the church last week I
[1:06:13] testified and I told him couple of weeks
[1:06:16] ago something happened in my life and I
[1:06:20] felt that I had slipped and I had
[1:06:23] disappointed the Lord and I made a
[1:06:25] mistake I went to God I said lord I
[1:06:30] didn't mean that I slipped I fell but
[1:06:34] lord I want to keep up and I said lord I
[1:06:37] am sorry please forgive me and so the
[1:06:41] Slovak said the Sunday before lost I
[1:06:44] came into church and I sat in the bench
[1:06:47] and the pastor preached that powerful
[1:06:49] sermon I wanted to stand up and I wanted
[1:06:54] to raise my hand and I wanted to say
[1:06:56] Amen them to plant in my mind
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:05] say Amen you remember what happened how
[1:07:11] can you how can you even raise your hand
[1:07:15] but it was a sort of few seconds and
[1:07:18] they winded that thought came to me
[1:07:21] I rebuke the devil in me as a devil you
[1:07:27] got nothing for me I'm a son of God I
[1:07:32] went to You Lord and I said I'm sorry
[1:07:37] [Applause]
[1:07:38] so I raised my head in fact I raised
[1:07:42] both hands and I was free you see
[1:07:50] because that is what the devil likes to
[1:07:52] do he likes to do that to the people of
[1:07:56] God we human rebirth the Bible says we
[1:07:59] bought flesh we make mistakes but they
[1:08:04] know the Dharma is a song it says Watson
[1:08:07] what's in it is gone the very minute you
[1:08:12] confessed
[1:08:13] so we failed God we make mistakes but
[1:08:16] God you know we gotta go team and say
[1:08:19] Lord forgive me and then he forgives and
[1:08:23] it's gone and the devil cannot bring it
[1:08:27] up before you again so when he tries
[1:08:33] when he tries to bring up that post
[1:08:36] before you and you know you can talk to
[1:08:48] the people and you say devil what sin
[1:08:52] you talking about
[1:08:54] it was gone the very minute I confessed
[1:09:03] that's what I love about this walk as a
[1:09:07] believer we walk in victory to read you
[1:09:13] another quote possessing the enemy's
[1:09:15] gates but the Branham praise of pray now
[1:09:19] Lord now our God and we are your
[1:09:23] servants we thank you for your word
[1:09:26] you know how thankful I am for the Word
[1:09:30] of God it's transformed my life he says
[1:09:34] we thank you for your word for the Holy
[1:09:37] Spirit who has blessed our hearts and
[1:09:38] now we happy we sitting here knowing
[1:09:41] that we are conquerors we already
[1:09:44] possess all the gates of the enemy it
[1:09:47] has been given to us and he says we have
[1:09:51] the master key
[1:09:54] in our hand you as you said yet tonight
[1:09:58] this evening
[1:10:00] you have with a Branham identify a
[1:10:02] master key in your head they know what a
[1:10:08] master key is this is probably a
[1:10:10] building is about many rooms and
[1:10:12] probably each room will have a different
[1:10:14] key and footing that door a master key
[1:10:18] is a key that you bring and a key that
[1:10:22] and go into every single door in this
[1:10:27] building and that can open up every
[1:10:31] single door in this building never the
[1:10:35] Brenin seized with a master key in our
[1:10:40] hand and then he identifies what this
[1:10:44] master key is he says the name of Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ shall open every date of the
[1:10:53] enemy take verse P the key of the name
[1:11:00] of Jesus and open every gate of the
[1:11:04] enemy that has you bound away from every
[1:11:09] promise so right now is your city
[1:11:16] to a mosque and maybe some of us might
[1:11:21] be sitting here and we might have boss
[1:11:23] or gates
[1:11:26] maybe gates of the pastor or certain
[1:11:29] gates that's that they'd be struggling
[1:11:31] to overcome the master key himself is
[1:11:37] yeah and the master key has given
[1:11:42] himself to you and to me he's saying
[1:11:47] Here I am
[1:11:48] use me I'm the master key I did go into
[1:11:53] that door that door that you think the
[1:11:59] enemy has not and he's sitting being
[1:12:02] Glee with Glee on his face and dangling
[1:12:05] his key in front of you you and I today
[1:12:09] brother branham identified the mosque as
[1:12:15] the name I read this quote in South
[1:12:29] Africa one time in a church and a young
[1:12:32] sister was sitting in the meeting
[1:12:35] you see these quotes that we read it's
[1:12:39] not just good black letters on white
[1:12:42] paper
[1:12:44] this quote is powerful this quotes that
[1:12:50] we read and she went home that night and
[1:13:10] the next day she was facing some
[1:13:12] situation and she told the Lord for the
[1:13:18] tears of yesterday telling me I
[1:13:24] have a must that can unlock every door
[1:13:29] every situation and she said Lord right
[1:13:33] now I want to use that master key in the
[1:13:38] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she
[1:13:42] says I used that master key for that
[1:13:45] situation and she said that door had to
[1:13:48] open even though it looked like it was
[1:13:53] locked
[1:14:02] we love the Word of God I just love this
[1:14:11] precious you know this you will somebody
[1:14:14] see that this message it's don't ever
[1:14:20] down please the value of this message
[1:14:25] this message is powerful
[1:14:28] this message is life-changing this
[1:14:31] message takes you and turns you around
[1:14:33] maybe you were walking with your back to
[1:14:36] God but this message has come your way
[1:14:38] turned you around and sit you on the
[1:14:42] right Road and a lot of times for the
[1:14:47] young people a lot of times we hear this
[1:14:51] hype sometimes that says you know Mike
[1:15:17] he says yeah we all end time red light
[1:15:24] down flesh coming of the Lord is at hand
[1:15:29] yes sir
[1:15:31] he says endtime message should meet end
[1:15:40] conditions look around look at the world
[1:15:45] that we're facing fault on every hand
[1:15:49] and time conditions this message is as
[1:15:56] powerful as it was then it's as powerful
[1:16:02] today so young people don't let me ever
[1:16:07] hear you say it's hard that this message
[1:16:11] is not powerful enough I want you to
[1:16:15] know that take the squirts put it on
[1:16:19] your phone or whatever and time message
[1:16:22] should meet endtime conditions don't
[1:16:30] forget that the enemy's going to try and
[1:16:34] his Trident with many people many people
[1:16:38] like we heard this morning has walked
[1:16:40] away because they didn't understand or
[1:16:43] maybe never had the revelation or I
[1:16:46] don't know but I want you to know
[1:16:49] tonight I don't see this evening I want
[1:16:56] you to some times you look at the
[1:17:17] situation it's powerful enough to make
[1:17:27] you walk with all the demonic forces
[1:17:31] around it's powerful enough to make you
[1:17:35] walk and not allow yourself to be
[1:17:38] defiled
[1:17:41] but the things happening around us you
[1:17:46] see I grew up in the message and I took
[1:17:50] discover after a while that this message
[1:17:54] it's not just a bunch of complicated
[1:17:58] intellectual quotes it's not just a
[1:18:02] bunch of complicated intellectual words
[1:18:06] cuz that's how I grew up
[1:18:08] sitting with with my family very
[1:18:11] intellectual sitting with my family my
[1:18:14] uncles and and the brothers and jjust
[1:18:17] man taking the message and splicing it's
[1:18:21] you splicing it year and doing that then
[1:18:23] explaining this explaining that and
[1:18:26] that's what I thought the message was
[1:18:30] the more I could quote brother Brennan
[1:18:33] the more I felt her I'm in the message
[1:18:40] but God had to come and deal with me
[1:18:46] personally
[1:18:49] anything she came to tell me she tears
[1:18:51] you have a relationship with the quotes
[1:18:55] with a letter you have a relationship
[1:18:58] with scripture you have a relationship
[1:19:01] with the picture brother branham but
[1:19:04] tears you don't have a relationship with
[1:19:06] me that's regarding to come and tell me
[1:19:10] in 1994 before that I was just walking
[1:19:15] along as a message member loving what
[1:19:20] they call a message lifestyle he'll miss
[1:19:23] his lifestyle long hair long dress
[1:19:26] brothers don't wait dude all these
[1:19:28] things the rules in the end them in the
[1:19:30] do's and the don'ts and that was my life
[1:19:32] but then Jesus came my way
[1:19:37] he turned me around and he came to tell
[1:19:42] me you have to know the quotes don't get
[1:19:47] me wrong you have to know the quotes but
[1:19:53] it's not an intellectual thing it's not
[1:19:56] about how much you know it's about who
[1:19:59] you know and thus close you and me we
[1:20:07] have to manifest the quotes that speaks
[1:20:11] about me so this morning pas fini came
[1:20:19] in he said then this is my favorite
[1:20:22] quote and he read his favorite quotes
[1:20:25] now I want to read you my favorite quote
[1:20:28] because this is a favorite quote and I
[1:20:32] see happening in my life
[1:20:38] statue of a perfect man never ate that
[1:20:42] never listened to it go listen to it
[1:20:45] statue of a perfect man 62 1014 in the
[1:20:51] morning he says and this is my favorite
[1:20:56] he says we not both organization I'm not
[1:21:03] here this morning to build an
[1:21:06] organization Christ never sent me to
[1:21:11] build organization of the next part but
[1:21:16] it's he says Christ see me do bold
[1:21:24] individuals do the statue of Jesus
[1:21:28] Christ
[1:21:30] that they might be the powerhouse and
[1:21:35] the dwelling place of the spirit by his
[1:21:41] word this is my quote so when I read it
[1:21:46] I say God sent me to build casual to the
[1:21:53] statue of Jesus Christ the casual might
[1:21:58] be the powerhouse and the dwelling place
[1:22:01] of the spirit by his words that's my and
[1:22:13] by the end do you know what I see
[1:22:16] happening in my life what did my wife
[1:22:19] sing little by little we will win every
[1:22:24] battle we see little by little he's
[1:22:29] molding tests lots of by little he's
[1:22:33] cutting off the things that doesn't
[1:22:35] belong little by little he's forming
[1:22:39] tests were all into that perfect image
[1:22:43] of Jesus Christ so this message is not a
[1:22:54] bunch of complicated intellectual

[1:24:34] tries he tries things but he's like a
[1:24:38] burger in ships brother Andy
[1:24:40] I believe whether James got so inspired
[1:24:42] but the change was in Christ Church and
[1:24:45] he was listening to the sermon over
[1:24:47] there in here but the end he was
[1:24:48] preaching and behind you see the devil
[1:24:49] is like like like I like bargaining's
[1:24:52] and by the James got so inspired about a
[1:24:55] James put a song together
[1:24:57] is it resents the temple is like
[1:25:00] beginnings now we know we don't play
[1:25:05] around with it when we read in the Bible
[1:25:08] how Daniel prayed and then at the end of
[1:25:11] the day they need reinforcements but
[1:25:14] we're God in the ship of our lives
[1:25:18] the devil has got nothing on doing me so

[1:27:21] was this there was this evil spirit it
[1:27:25] was just
[1:27:26] the stabbing this evil spirit was just
[1:27:30] trying to keep now remember I was
[1:27:34] driving in my car in Cambridge before I

[1:27:40] said I must greet the church for the bin
[1:27:42] from Cambridge where the David Shirley
[1:27:44] is the only he's one of the brothers in
[1:27:46] Cambridge at the Lourdes just allowed us

[1:27:51] here he said please greet the believers
[1:27:53] so I want to greet you from brother
[1:27:55] David Shearer I was driving in my car as
[1:27:58] I was driving I started talking I said I
[1:28:20] feel in my just change something then I
[1:28:37] heard myself it's like I was sitting in
[1:28:42] the passenger seat I was watching myself
[1:28:48] I heard words coming from my mouth
[1:28:56] speaking to this evil spirits and it was
[1:29:01] words it just just flowed it addressed
[1:29:09] that when I came out of it I just I'd I
[1:29:18] was so weak and I I took my car I turned
[1:29:21] it around and I came home and in a night
[1:29:23] I pulled up in my driveway I got that to
[1:29:26] the coin I was walking like a drunk bus
[1:29:28] and I walked into the house in my wife
[1:29:30] said hey you okay what's wrong
[1:29:34] so I'm going to go throw myself on the
[1:29:36] sofa and I said I need to rest a bit off
[1:29:40] powers vested strength came back into me
[1:29:44] but do you know what the beautiful part
[1:29:47] of the season I'm the kind of person I'm
[1:29:50] very emotional I get very but I don't
[1:29:54] allow the emotion to dictate and I want
[1:30:04] to see so the next day I watched it and
[1:30:24] no no no no demon trying to disturb me
[1:30:27] the next week I watched it nothing the
[1:30:30] next month but went on to a year two
[1:30:33] years later and that the Devils are
[1:30:44] subject to the name of Jesus when he
[1:30:49] brought the pregnancy's house of hell
[1:30:51] deep way to the name of Jesus you see

[1:37:12] the apples you can change situations in
[1:37:17] your home

[1:37:22] of God I love the courts but for me you
[1:37:25] know it's more than a court these are
[1:37:28] things that I want to see manifest but
[1:37:32] the Branham says justified in his sight
[1:37:35] why are we justified
[1:37:38] we are his victory you as you said you
[1:37:44] are his the church is his victory we
[1:37:52] come forth in this last days this
[1:37:55] glorious gospel showing so as you love
[1:38:00] your life as a Christian you are showing
[1:38:03] his victory he died for this purpose and
[1:38:10] we are proof of his victory when we see
[1:38:16] him coming down in loving amongst the
[1:38:19] church that's his victory it shows that
[1:38:26] he couldn't keep in the grave neither
[1:38:30] can they keep us in the grave we are
[1:38:34] life is his life that's flowing and
[1:38:39] pulsating within us and I'm grateful to
[1:38:45] Almighty God to know that Calvary
[1:38:50] because of Calvary
[1:38:53] I am NOT the man I used to be thanks to
[1:38:57] Calvary because of what he did for you
[1:39:01] and what he did for me we can walk in
[1:39:06] victory I'm gonna finish it with this
[1:39:11] musicians can come it's a quote that my
[1:39:14] favorite brother-in-law in New Zealand
[1:39:16] he raided many years ago and I just
[1:39:20] couldn't get away from this now I'm
[1:39:24] gonna end up with this musician joking
[1:39:25] come it's in the message the great and
[1:39:29] mighty conqueror but since men was
[1:39:36] refused from heaven the highways was
[1:39:41] closed there was no highways but the
[1:39:46] balances but where there was no highways
[1:39:49] he come to make him brother branham's
[1:39:54] thoughts dramatizing he says oh my he
[1:39:57] says the first line around the earth was
[1:40:01] demons of doubts he says then the next
[1:40:06] line was prejudice he says the next was
[1:40:11] selfishness he says this earth was
[1:40:15] covered over with lines of deep pain
[1:40:22] sicknesses diseases him by the brand
[1:40:26] name refers to the sermon he says last
[1:40:28] night we heard him coming out of hell
[1:40:31] with the keys of death and how on his
[1:40:34] side this morning by the Benham says we
[1:40:37] taking him up they by the balances
[1:40:39] hallelujah then Dan the Baron says when
[1:40:42] he arose he was he broke every devil
[1:40:54] power that holds over man
[1:40:59] so been abandoned first early said this
[1:41:01] world was covered with demonic powers
[1:41:05] for the Branham says as he went up he
[1:41:10] broke every devil power that holds over
[1:41:15] man so if you think that there's a devil
[1:41:20] power that's trying to hold you down
[1:41:24] Jesus Christ broker every devil power
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] that holds over man he has seen that on
[1:41:35] high so that's my my alum I don't want
[1:41:40] to preach too long yeah he has seen that
[1:41:44] on high and gave leads to mean the gift
[1:41:48] of the Holy Spirit the mighty Conqueror
[1:41:52] he stands alone and brother Branham says
[1:41:56] between he is the blessed and mate for
[1:42:35] us for you and for me all the way
[1:42:40] through Easter so you see all he wants
[1:42:43] of us is to walk and to follow in his
[1:42:48] bloody footprints
[1:42:50] he left this and we walk he left the
[1:42:54] days and we walked the demon might be
[1:42:57] yeah the devil's might be there but we
[1:43:00] walk and as long as you walking
[1:43:03] following the bloody footprints of Jesus
[1:43:08] Christ
