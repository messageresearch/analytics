[31:26] see it at the the musicians I'm not
[31:28] going to make that mistake again
[31:30] God bless you
[31:32] um
[31:34] what a week
[31:36] Brother Andy would say tumultuous it was
[31:38] that
[31:41] but it was good because
[31:44] the higher the waves the closer the
[31:46] master amen
[31:48] sometimes we we need a Peter experience
[31:51] and sometimes we
[31:53] we need the mountains and sometimes we
[31:56] need the valleys and other times we just
[31:58] want to be under a tree sleeping a bit
[32:00] and resting but that's all good that's
[32:02] all in time
[32:04] we've got a bit of a Bible study tonight
[32:06] and that's not a Bible study it's more
[32:07] take out your word and just follow with
[32:10] me Liam to your Bible say sorry but um
[32:13] the phone can't keep up
[32:15] so you're gonna have to share with
[32:16] Reuben but just just invite him in and
[32:21] and just ask that the Lord would speak
[32:23] to you tonight maybe knock on your door
[32:25] you know just just come and speak to you
[32:27] and and help you to understand when I
[32:31] was putting this service together it
[32:33] started with
[32:36] um being a for real life Christian okay
[32:39] it means that it's with your failings
[32:41] and your ups and downs and your
[32:42] everything by just standing for Christ
[32:45] in your time and it kind of
[32:47] went into something different a little
[32:49] bit but more serious but for us as
[32:52] Believers we know where we stand so so
[32:55] if you feel or maybe preaching at you
[32:57] and you you want to start feeling like a
[32:58] buzzard you're not don't let Satan trick
[33:01] you into it just hear go back into the
[33:04] scriptures and search it
[33:06] for this is what we do so we're going to
[33:08] open our scripture with one Peter 2.
[33:13] and I just got onto that scripture and
[33:15] it kept coming back as the song service
[33:17] was coming loud and clear just keep
[33:19] coming back and I remember the Sunday
[33:21] School teachers that we love so much I
[33:23] think sister Braun when you did this
[33:24] scripture with the Sunday School
[33:28] or it may be a sister cheers when she
[33:30] was here but it was awesome it says but
[33:33] you're a chosen generation a royal
[33:35] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[33:38] people that ye should show forth the
[33:41] Praises of him who hath called you out
[33:43] of Darkness into Marvelous Light
[33:47] I hope you read this with me is that is
[33:49] that did you find it one Peter
[33:52] 2 verse 9. sorry didn't I give you the
[33:55] verse my bad verse 9.
[33:59] so let's read it again but you are a
[34:01] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[34:03] holy nation A peculiar people we're an
[34:06] odd bunch of fellas if you really think
[34:08] about it you know
[34:11] um I'm just thinking about it we'll
[34:12] finish this I want to finish the
[34:13] scripture I'm just thinking about when
[34:16] you go to a a Works function and
[34:18] everybody gets food and they all just
[34:21] jump right in there and they just jump
[34:22] it and you stop and you say thank you
[34:24] Lord for this food and you pray for each
[34:26] one on that table that maybe the Lord
[34:28] would touch them will go by their way as
[34:30] well
[34:30] You're A peculiar people they cannot
[34:33] figure you out
[34:35] amen but your reason here is that ye
[34:39] shall so show forth the Praises of him
[34:42] who have called you out of Darkness into
[34:45] Marvelous Light you may have your seats
[34:48] amen
[34:49] um so young people let's not lose this
[34:53] service I never really preach at anyone
[34:57] but myself so this is for me but I
[34:59] really feel
[35:00] strongly to speak to our young gentlemen
[35:03] and young ladies that went to the the
[35:08] what did they call it banquet I want to
[35:10] keep calling it a bull but Tiana keeps
[35:12] telling me it's not a ball because they
[35:14] dance at balls so it's a banquet okay
[35:17] and and it's a wonderful thing because
[35:19] when I was young it is quite exciting to
[35:21] go to those you know when I was young
[35:23] brother beans are going to get me for
[35:24] that one and uh
[35:26] it is you're dressed up and you look
[35:28] nice and you and you feel nice and it's
[35:30] a different atmosphere in the air it's
[35:32] just a wonderful time in a young
[35:34] person's life
[35:36] but we live in a world which is which is
[35:39] really
[35:40] dangerous
[35:42] it is really dangerous spiritually and
[35:44] physically it's a real dangerous world
[35:46] it's it's it's War out there it's war
[35:49] between God it's war between Satan
[35:51] that's the only two Powers there there
[35:53] is no other power these two Powers these
[35:56] the superpower which is God and then
[35:58] there's just power which is Satan okay
[36:00] he still has power and he can deceive
[36:03] and he uses that that deception really
[36:06] nicely even starts in church you're
[36:08] tired you want to sleep you don't want
[36:10] to listen you had a big day I wonder
[36:12] what he's doing he's got power and they
[36:14] both gonna fight right here in the stop
[36:16] four inches
[36:18] so the only way you're going to get your
[36:20] blessing is if you're going to clear
[36:22] this top for inches and say Lord may
[36:24] your word go in there and from there may
[36:27] come in here so ask him to give you
[36:30] those words so I'm going to go to Romans
[36:32] 8 as well I've got this scripture here
[36:34] as well my title is living in the word
[36:37] now
[36:38] if you fight a lot of spiritual battles
[36:41] if you fight a lot of people from from
[36:44] the world they always use a certain type
[36:48] of scripture to justify
[36:51] why they do things
[36:54] they take that scripture they make it
[36:56] their Solace they could have heard it
[36:58] from a third party they could have heard
[36:59] it from a pastor they could have heard
[37:01] it from a very good sermon but they only
[37:03] take that scripture and they mold their
[37:06] reasoning and understanding around the
[37:08] scripture but this is dangerous because
[37:11] that's not Revelation that's reasoning
[37:14] I'm off my notes but I need to clear
[37:16] this up Revelation is when you find it
[37:19] in the scripture and the scriptures ties
[37:21] together the old and the new and the the
[37:25] word of God just comes together and it
[37:28] actually sinks it into your heart and
[37:29] the message of the hour why we follow
[37:31] the message of the hour is because a
[37:33] prophet stood here and he took the Old
[37:36] Testament and he took the New Testament
[37:37] and he said the Shadow and the the what
[37:40] is now the reality is coming together
[37:42] and it's all the Lord Jesus Christ he
[37:45] didn't say it is me he says it's the
[37:47] Lord Jesus Christ unfolding more
[37:49] revealing more of himself but we find
[37:52] ourselves in the dangerous place we find
[37:54] ourselves in a world which is absolutely
[37:57] geared up for the young people
[38:01] because the young people want
[38:03] entertainment
[38:05] I don't want the service
[38:08] do you like a service Lily every Sunday
[38:10] every Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[38:14] no YouTube
[38:16] no nothing
[38:17] oh I got a thinking
[38:20] no basketball no football Jaden nothing
[38:23] just church church preaching preaching
[38:27] who would like that
[38:31] Brother Andy would love that
[38:35] but these do you think that when we come
[38:38] here together that the kids don't find
[38:40] it boring
[38:41] some days they do
[38:43] that's all right
[38:45] but I want to ask you if you come here
[38:47] every Sunday in every Wednesday and you
[38:50] still find it boring
[38:52] are you putting in anything
[38:55] because this is going to be a tug of war
[38:57] this is a tug of war between Satan and
[39:00] you God already has you because you
[39:03] predestinated it's wreaked you win yes
[39:05] but every Sunday there's going to be a
[39:08] battle
[39:09] and the one that pulls the hardest is
[39:12] the one that's going to win and if you
[39:14] let the world pull the hardest you're
[39:16] gonna go to the world and your mind will
[39:18] go into the world and you'll start
[39:20] doodling on pictures and riding on your
[39:22] pins and papers and digging in your nose
[39:24] and doing all those other things and
[39:26] scratching your nails and doing your
[39:28] toes while you're in church because I
[39:30] cleaned the church the other day and I
[39:31] saw shavings of toes on the on the floor
[39:35] I was like it must be so boring in
[39:37] church that you would scratch your toes
[39:39] in church
[39:40] oh mama I'm I'm serious I want to drive
[39:43] down a point we are at a place with we
[39:46] don't have time for this there is no
[39:49] more time the prophet preached a sermon
[39:52] in 1965 in June
[39:55] June is the six months hey June July
[39:58] yeah on the 23rd the flashing red light
[40:01] of his coming
[40:03] and I was fortunate enough to to go and
[40:06] listen to the sermon so I want to ask
[40:08] you kids the the the young men and the
[40:11] young woman that likes to go to all
[40:13] these fancy things and dress up how many
[40:15] sermons do you listen to
[40:17] in a week
[40:22] how many times do you put the voice of
[40:24] God on in your house or in your place or
[40:27] in your phone because we listen to music
[40:31] day in Day Out
[40:34] music ain't gonna get you in heaven
[40:38] see what brother Branham hit that thing
[40:39] hard he says there was a spirit of rock
[40:41] and roll that came amongst the churches
[40:43] he says and those people are led by that
[40:46] spirit and it's going to lead them all
[40:47] the way into Armageddon because they
[40:50] listen to music they don't listen to
[40:52] sound Doctrine anymore they don't listen
[40:55] to the word of God they don't listen to
[40:57] the prophet of God they just listen to
[41:00] music
[41:02] have you found yourself every day
[41:04] listening to music yet you put the word
[41:07] of God to the side and then tonight you
[41:09] jump in bed and we all just quickly read
[41:11] our scripture we pray very sincerely and
[41:13] then we sleep
[41:15] have you actually meditated upon the
[41:18] word of the Lord have you taken food and
[41:20] fed yourself and how is your diet
[41:24] because what you put in
[41:26] is what's going to come out that's right
[41:29] that's right you know when I know
[41:30] somebody stuck in the world I look at
[41:33] them
[41:34] if I start seeing the eyes are glossing
[41:37] a bit a little more and the cheeks are
[41:38] getting a bit more reader you know and
[41:40] clothes are a bit more tighter you know
[41:43] boys I'm not going to hit you hard I'm
[41:45] just eat you soft the hairstyles change
[41:49] I'm honest I can see where your focus is
[41:53] I can see where you're looking I can see
[41:56] the influence upon your life
[42:00] so I want to I want to show you
[42:02] something
[42:03] brother Brandon preaches this and he
[42:06] sees these three things that would taste
[42:08] a man okay money popularity and
[42:12] thank you
[42:14] the responsibility when brother Brennan
[42:16] was preaching what fell heavily upon the
[42:18] woman and he got criticized a lot for it
[42:22] but see God wasn't like in the Old
[42:24] Testament looking for a king or a leader
[42:27] to lead his people he's looking for a
[42:29] bride
[42:30] so when the prophet of God came here he
[42:32] was looking for a woman a bride for
[42:36] Christ
[42:37] so hence why when brother Brennan was
[42:40] preaching the woman got out of control
[42:42] the main let it happen it's true but his
[42:46] Focus was not the men though he
[42:47] addressed them many a times he said
[42:49] woman you're responsible for it meaning
[42:51] also the church
[42:54] because remember this is the bride call
[42:57] and what happened is it was as in the
[43:00] days of Sodom and Gomorrah it was as the
[43:02] days of Noah and when the prophet
[43:04] stepped on the scene and he started
[43:05] looking around he saw the same Trend
[43:07] that was happening in both those ages
[43:10] happening right now
[43:12] and that's why God made him a certain
[43:14] way to hit it so if your sisters listen
[43:16] to the sermons and you think he's only
[43:18] picking on your hair your skirts and
[43:20] your way you conduct yourself it's not
[43:22] that it is also a really big part of it
[43:24] but it is about the church
[43:27] the church lining up with the word the
[43:30] full word not a little bit of it but
[43:32] every bit of it and sometimes when we as
[43:35] as as I can't say ministers
[43:39] come and we hit a certain thing then
[43:41] people get offended but that's not right
[43:44] because we don't get offended as
[43:46] Christians
[43:48] we we just go Lord why did you say that
[43:51] because if you truly believe that the
[43:54] vessels standing in front of you every
[43:55] Sunday and Wednesday doesn't matter who
[43:57] it is it's anointed by God and preaching
[44:00] the full word of God and he can show you
[44:01] in the scripture where he's getting it
[44:03] from should you not go back to the
[44:05] scripture
[44:06] instead of going back to reasoning
[44:09] because there's a lot of voices out
[44:11] there but there's only one Bible and
[44:14] this Bible does not contradict itself
[44:17] now you young man I'm going to tell you
[44:19] something today and I said it earlier to
[44:22] Tiana and then when we had a chat this
[44:23] week
[44:24] if you want the righteous woman
[44:28] do you gonna you're gonna the image that
[44:30] you have in your head you're gonna look
[44:31] for so if you want someone like your mom
[44:36] mom's I'll give you full credit
[44:38] you're looking for someone that's
[44:39] dressed modestly you're looking for
[44:41] someone that's in their place you're
[44:43] looking you're not looking at a loud
[44:44] mouth you're not looking at someone that
[44:46] flirts with every every other boy if
[44:48] your heart is looking for a wife and a
[44:51] mother then your taste will reflect it
[44:54] and you will look for that woman
[44:56] and you will dress accordingly and
[44:58] you'll walk accordingly and you'll act
[45:00] accordingly because you are going to act
[45:02] like a man because you want a woman
[45:06] so a woman when she's looking at a man
[45:08] and he stays is Takis and all those
[45:12] things and that this the slit can come
[45:15] up to here and the skirt is the end is
[45:17] nothing in between there and all those
[45:18] things that just reflects the taste he
[45:21] has
[45:22] I know I was in the world
[45:25] so I know it's a bit hard but that's the
[45:28] type of girl he wants so he doesn't want
[45:30] a mom he doesn't want a wife a help mate
[45:33] he just wants something that looks nice
[45:35] so it's as if you look at a Porsche or
[45:38] you look at a Ferrari or you look at a
[45:40] fuller it's the same thing I'm not happy
[45:42] with this I want that because it's
[45:44] pleasing to the eye but that's not how
[45:46] God sees people
[45:48] and this is what I want to tell you
[45:50] young people I've got such a burden for
[45:52] you because Snapchat and all these
[45:54] things and all these shorts are just
[45:55] grooming you to look for women like that
[45:58] but you should not look for them
[46:02] because it's not your position
[46:05] you're selling your Birthright you're
[46:07] actually lowering your standard and all
[46:10] you're gonna get is a mess in your house
[46:12] one day you're young take my advice
[46:16] take my advice if your taste is not a
[46:19] Godly taste what you're going to feed it
[46:22] is not going to be from God
[46:24] and whatever you look upon on YouTube
[46:26] and all those things and wherever I can
[46:29] see everybody can see it because it
[46:31] comes out because you can put only this
[46:33] much in before it starts coming out oh
[46:36] yes
[46:39] so so then I say some people come and
[46:41] say we struggle the the prophet preaches
[46:45] hard things and he's always hitting
[46:47] women and he's always why
[46:49] I listen to it and I see Life
[46:51] I see a soberness I see a reality check
[46:56] I listen to and I go oh God let that not
[46:59] be me I don't want to do that I want to
[47:01] just be lined up with your scriptures
[47:02] and time and again when he preaches he
[47:04] preaches at me I don't Fork it
[47:07] doesn't help no one
[47:08] he preaches to me
[47:10] so I wanted I want to show you a couple
[47:12] of things grab your Bibles open it up in
[47:14] in um
[47:16] Matthew 24. oh wait wait go go to
[47:19] Genesis 6 I'll Do Matthew 24. so Jesus
[47:22] and the disciples are at the Mount of
[47:25] Olives and the disciples asked him three
[47:28] questions okay some people think it was
[47:31] only one question but it was three
[47:32] distinct questions they asked him what
[47:35] would be the sign of the end of the
[47:37] world
[47:38] what would be the sign of you coming and
[47:41] when will be the no stone left upon this
[47:43] this Temple
[47:44] three questions but I want to answer the
[47:47] one tonight because I want you young
[47:49] people to know where you are right now
[47:52] because if in 1965 which was 58 years
[47:56] ago according to my maths and I could be
[47:58] wrong
[47:59] he already shared that the the flashing
[48:02] of the light the train is coming and he
[48:04] used this analogy he said they called it
[48:07] the trains and the blocks so you
[48:08] standing at the station and and the
[48:10] light is off
[48:12] and you're having a coffee and you're
[48:13] talking to to Davey and to Liam and
[48:15] having a lack of chat and it's all good
[48:17] and all of a sudden the light goes red
[48:19] pong
[48:20] Punk bang and you're like my train is on
[48:24] the way so what should you do coffee is
[48:27] not allowed on the train you don't smoke
[48:29] on that train you don't have other bad
[48:31] behaviors on that train
[48:33] okay you cannot take your friends on
[48:35] that train because you only have your
[48:36] ticket they need to get on the train
[48:38] what do you do you put everything down
[48:41] you get your ticket and you go wait for
[48:43] the train
[48:44] and you stand
[48:47] and the train comes you can't see it
[48:50] you can't even hear it but you know that
[48:53] that light flashing red says it is a
[48:56] coming and you need to get on it and in
[48:58] the old days they didn't wait for you
[49:00] you're either on the train or it leaves
[49:02] without you we're again at that time
[49:06] you're either going to get on the gospel
[49:08] train or it will leave without you there
[49:10] is no buts or maybes I know we preach
[49:12] Grace I know we preach all those things
[49:14] God is a good God but you still have to
[49:17] have your ticket which is the Holy
[49:19] Spirit you still need to get on the
[49:20] train
[49:22] so if the light's flashing and it's
[49:24] saying that there's time to repent and
[49:26] to get ready and to get good with God
[49:28] and make it right now is the time
[49:30] because the light has been flashing for
[49:32] 58 years
[49:34] there will be a day where the train
[49:36] comes in and it will be gone
[49:39] don't be left without your ticket
[49:41] whatever you do
[49:43] I'm not throwing you over hell or
[49:45] Doomsday it's a reality brother Branham
[49:47] said it's such a secret calling away he
[49:49] says in the days of Noah eight Souls
[49:51] were saved and all of those people only
[49:54] ate
[49:56] are you one of them brother being
[49:58] preached the sermon with the three
[49:59] monkeys
[50:01] man I was glad I was one of those
[50:02] monkeys hey I don't know who the guy was
[50:04] that was left behind but I was in there
[50:06] I know it was me and Ben at that time
[50:08] you know because Ben was preaching it so
[50:09] Sister Christine sorry I just thought
[50:11] I'm pushing him before you because he
[50:13] says this only place with two monkeys I
[50:15] felt like a monkey that day but I got on
[50:18] the boat okay don't know why they picked
[50:20] up the sand flies and all those other
[50:22] things and the creepy crawlies I wish
[50:24] they could have left him behind but they
[50:26] went in the boat so in Matthew he asked
[50:28] those three questions but now we're
[50:29] going to go to Genesis 6. so let's go to
[50:31] Genesis 6.
[50:34] young people I hope you follow me
[50:36] because you're gonna have to get on this
[50:38] boat tonight
[50:39] because if you don't get on this boat
[50:41] there might not be
[50:43] a world for you tomorrow
[50:45] no one's life is guaranteed
[50:47] no one
[50:49] so we go to Genesis and we go Genesis 6
[50:52] I've got my place all the year though
[50:54] it's the first book of the Bible
[50:57] Genesis Revelation I got that okay so
[51:00] it's easy and it came to pass when the
[51:03] man began to multiply apply on the face
[51:05] of the Earth and her daughters were born
[51:07] unto them so we'll pause there for a sec
[51:10] because it's a little bible study so
[51:11] just follow me
[51:13] so in 19th of Genesis 6
[51:16] verse 1. so in 1950 so I thought before
[51:20] the prophet really really opened the
[51:23] seals and all those things let's just go
[51:25] a couple years 15 years so he was born
[51:27] in 1933 so I thought if I hit it right
[51:30] in the middle 1950 would be a good good
[51:32] place to get these stats okay
[51:35] so
[51:36] here is 1950 births on this whole face
[51:40] of this Earth okay was 92 million people
[51:45] were born in 1950 which was recorded so
[51:49] by Abacus or pin or whatever they they
[51:52] made it happy okay so 92 million people
[51:56] in 2022 which is last year because we're
[51:59] going to use this year we're still
[52:00] halfway in there
[52:01] 133 million people were born
[52:06] now you say that doesn't sound much it's
[52:08] 44 million more a year that's being
[52:10] birthed on this Earth
[52:12] but see when I looked at the statute it
[52:14] didn't look like this scripture because
[52:15] brother Branham takes the scripture and
[52:17] he says that the people were multiplying
[52:20] he says and today they are multiplying
[52:22] at a rapid rate let me go tell you how
[52:25] many people should be on this face of
[52:27] the Earth abortions for the year 2022 is
[52:31] 73 million
[52:33] accounted for not the ones you don't
[52:36] know about
[52:38] so if you take 73 and you take your your
[52:41] 44 million you've got 104 million people
[52:44] more a year than 50 years ago or
[52:48] 70 years ago
[52:50] so people are increasing upon the Earth
[52:52] exactly as it was in the days of Noah
[52:56] we are increasing in exactly we cannot
[52:58] even feed most of the people we could
[53:00] but we wouldn't want to because greed
[53:02] plays a big role of it but our current
[53:04] situation now is we've got so many
[53:06] people and the place in the earth is
[53:09] just getting smaller
[53:11] and I want to ask you this is something
[53:14] that just the Lord just showed me if we
[53:16] have
[53:17] llqbtt plus hashtags and all those
[53:20] things communities with that's not
[53:23] having children what if everybody was a
[53:25] real mom and a real dad
[53:27] for real mom and dad and had children
[53:29] how many would we then be multiplying if
[53:32] they weren't all confused or wanted to
[53:34] be a pot plant in the center of the room
[53:36] like seriously man the the world is
[53:40] losing the marbles they're absolutely
[53:43] going insane but we think it's funny but
[53:46] it is but it's not funny
[53:48] because the same so so when God looked
[53:51] at him was gone I can't go I can't jump
[53:53] ahead go to the next verse please
[53:55] he says and he was the sons of gods or
[53:58] the daughters of man and they were fair
[53:59] and they looked up and they took upon
[54:01] them wives of all which they chose now
[54:04] that wives wasn't marrying wives if you
[54:07] look at the strong concordance and
[54:09] brother Branham hits this thing he says
[54:11] they just took upon them woman the word
[54:14] means their woman in the strong
[54:15] concordance go find it it actually sees
[54:18] that Hebrew words it's a adulterous
[54:20] woman
[54:21] okay so I've got it here on the and it
[54:23] hits that hard he says because what
[54:26] happened is the girls looked so pretty
[54:29] that the sons of God not angels
[54:32] was not angels it was sons of God looked
[54:37] upon this woman and they were really
[54:40] pretty
[54:41] now I'll tell you now you go walk and I
[54:44] went to Google 1963 fashion okay and I
[54:48] looked at the most prettiest girls
[54:50] because I just do this in 1963
[54:52] they have nothing
[54:54] nothing on the goes out day today
[54:58] nothing
[54:59] not even a patch
[55:01] not not this much so you sisters you
[55:04] think that's your competition it's not
[55:07] it's a abomination in the sight of God
[55:10] and I feel for those people because they
[55:12] trapped they trapped and they following
[55:15] the media and they're following a
[55:16] fashion and they're following such
[55:18] pressure put on them you need to be
[55:21] natural the prophet says the woman needs
[55:23] to be natural boys you need to be
[55:25] natural don't fake it we don't fake it
[55:28] till we make it we natural we're for
[55:31] real life Christians we are who we are
[55:34] and what the scripture says we are that
[55:36] we are
[55:38] we don't deny it
[55:40] so go to verse 3.
[55:42] he says then the Lord said my spirit
[55:44] shall not always strive with man for
[55:46] that is also
[55:48] um
[55:50] for he also is flesh yet his day shall
[55:52] be 120 years strange
[55:56] Noah preached for 120 years so that
[55:59] generation might not get it but now I
[56:01] want to say to you God looks at these
[56:03] these sons of God
[56:04] that goes through this woman and
[56:06] starting to make this abomination
[56:09] and he says you know what
[56:11] I don't want to strive with these people
[56:14] now now look at this type here we've got
[56:16] the churches that is cutting up Christ
[56:19] in so many pieces and saying you can do
[56:21] so many different things different
[56:23] baptisms false doctrines all these
[56:25] things
[56:26] isn't it the same that God would look at
[56:28] this woman this church and go no this
[56:31] one but I mean I chose like like
[56:33] Methodist Baptist that takes the word of
[56:36] man over the word of God and doesn't he
[56:38] say the same my spirit will not strive
[56:41] with him
[56:42] so why did the message have to come
[56:44] because God said I'm going to remove
[56:46] myself from all these denominations and
[56:50] I'm going to get myself a word bride it
[56:53] had to happen because who's right if the
[56:56] Pentecostals is right the Baptist is
[56:58] wrong the Methodist is wrong the
[57:00] Presbyterians is wrong the whole thing
[57:01] is a mess so God looks as this in 1933
[57:05] sins of prophet says you know what
[57:06] elieza you're going to go get me a bride
[57:09] but you're going to get me one that is
[57:11] dressed the way I want to dream that's
[57:13] going to walk the way I wanted to walk
[57:15] you know her hair will look a certain
[57:17] way her apparel will look a certain way
[57:20] she will like certain things she will
[57:22] pray different than the others they all
[57:25] might at the end of the day can be a lot
[57:27] of copies out there but that one would
[57:29] be genuine she will be for real life
[57:32] so that's the prophet's Ministry it is
[57:35] not a bunch of rules and regulations
[57:36] young men it is God lining us up to say
[57:39] this is the Taste and this is the taste
[57:42] of a real man
[57:44] and this is the response of a real woman
[57:48] so he goes on the inverse um
[57:50] four and it says there were giants on
[57:52] the earth in those days
[57:54] and also after that when the sons of God
[57:57] came not the Giants he says they were
[58:00] giants
[58:01] he says stop
[58:03] see they were giants on the earth on
[58:06] those days and also after that when the
[58:09] Suns came into the daughters of men
[58:13] there's no marriage said they
[58:16] isn't it exactly where we are today
[58:19] you can be partners
[58:21] you can be lovers you can be friends you
[58:24] can be whatever you want to be I don't
[58:27] want to marry you I don't have time for
[58:28] that isn't that exactly where we are
[58:30] today wake up man
[58:33] this world is exactly in that condition
[58:36] and the prophet said already in 50 or in
[58:39] 65 it's done it is done he says it is so
[58:43] bad that and I'm gonna play you this
[58:44] clip I want to play it right after this
[58:46] because I want to go into the life of
[58:48] lot as well he says it's so man it's so
[58:51] bad that that even him having to present
[58:54] the bride to Christ when he saw the
[58:56] vision he felt ashamed
[58:59] and you can hear it
[59:01] that's why I said are you listening to
[59:03] the tapes are you sober minded or are we
[59:06] busy with entertainment right because
[59:09] entertainment is going to leave you
[59:10] right here
[59:12] I'm sorry but it is it's only the ones
[59:15] that know God he says he says you're a
[59:18] worker of iniquity I never knew you
[59:21] you're not having a relationship with me
[59:23] you're not you're not you're not talking
[59:25] to me you're not fellowshipping with me
[59:28] you're not married to me because all you
[59:30] do is you eat everything else and when
[59:32] you need me you call me
[59:36] when things go wrong you go on your
[59:38] knees
[59:39] when things go really right you go all
[59:41] praise the Lord but what's the in
[59:43] between like it's not just for better
[59:45] and For Worse what's this in between
[59:47] where's our talk at night
[59:49] or when you walk
[59:51] you go yes Lord I love you
[59:54] you know I look at Brother Andy when you
[59:57] wrote that song
[59:59] blessing and honor and praise I can see
[1:00:02] you sing it in front of the throne
[1:00:05] I can see I can see that song came out
[1:00:07] of somewhere it wasn't just it must have
[1:00:09] come out and you would have just shouted
[1:00:11] it I hope it did you write the song you
[1:00:14] did because when I see him sing it I
[1:00:16] know that's a for real life Christian
[1:00:18] and I don't put you on a pedestal
[1:00:20] Brother Andy but if I have to listen to
[1:00:22] saving service in a week about I would
[1:00:25] still listen to them same as you because
[1:00:27] for me that's life it's not because I'm
[1:00:28] trying to keep myself and be like a
[1:00:30] Mormon and I can't do this I just love
[1:00:33] hearing about my Lord
[1:00:35] amen I can't get enough of it
[1:00:37] amen so we'll finish that can you uh
[1:00:40] brother Ed put that up and I want you to
[1:00:42] take a moment and just listen what the
[1:00:45] prophet says about a vision that he saw
[1:00:48] about that bride and where we are now
[1:00:51] in time
[1:01:15] the lovely bunch of women real nice
[1:01:19] dress long hair fixed nice in the back
[1:01:22] sleeves skirts down deeply and they were
[1:01:26] all in a marching tune like Onward
[1:01:30] Christian Soldiers marching as to war
[1:01:33] with the cross of Jesus going on before
[1:01:37] and as they pass by us stood and there
[1:01:40] was something there uh some Spirit God
[1:01:43] and said there is the bride
[1:01:47] and I looked and my heart was happy and
[1:01:49] she went around this way and passed
[1:01:52] around behind me after a while when she
[1:01:55] come back this way he said now the
[1:01:58] modern church will come into preview and
[1:02:01] here come the Asian Church up honor
[1:02:04] received such a filthy bunch here come
[1:02:06] the other churches up all the different
[1:02:08] nations they look horrible and I I'll
[1:02:11] say this because I'm Duty bound to tell
[1:02:14] the truth before God and when he said
[1:02:17] Here Comes the Church of America now to
[1:02:20] be previewed if I ever seen a bunch of
[1:02:24] devils it was that
[1:02:26] them women were strip naked with an old
[1:02:30] gray looking thing like a color of an
[1:02:32] elephant's hide
[1:02:33] and just hold it in front of him with no
[1:02:36] upper part on it at all and they were
[1:02:39] doing this kind of stuff that these
[1:02:41] these dances that these kids do out
[1:02:43] you're that twist and stuff and that
[1:02:45] kind of music going on
[1:02:47] and when I seen Miss USA come up
[1:02:52] I almost faded
[1:02:54] now this is thus saith the Lord
[1:02:58] if you believe me to be his servant you
[1:03:01] believe me now I would say that for
[1:03:03] nothing in the world
[1:03:05] there's not enough money in all the
[1:03:07] world to get me to say that if it wasn't
[1:03:08] true
[1:03:10] and when she come by that was a
[1:03:12] filthiest looking thing I ever seen and
[1:03:14] I thought God his heart is preachers and
[1:03:16] we brother have Labor to get you a bride
[1:03:19] and that's the best we could do
[1:03:21] she was twisting holding this in front
[1:03:23] of her like all these hula skirts of a
[1:03:26] thing holding it in front of her Parts
[1:03:28] the lower part like this dancing and
[1:03:30] twisting like these kids do out here on
[1:03:33] the on these vulgar shows that they had
[1:03:36] Tristan
[1:03:38] that was Miss
[1:03:41] Christianity of America
[1:03:44] so help me by the help of God that's
[1:03:48] what it looks like in his face
[1:03:50] I I just I started I could have faded I
[1:03:53] go to all the trying and the preaching
[1:03:55] and the persuading every one of with bob
[1:03:58] hair
[1:04:01] and they were twisting and carrying on
[1:04:03] holding this in front of they come
[1:04:05] around where I was standing there with
[1:04:06] this supernatural being I couldn't see
[1:04:08] him I hear him talking to him he's right
[1:04:09] around me but when they turned this way
[1:04:11] the whole is this twisting and laughing
[1:04:13] and going on carrying on like that
[1:04:15] holding this in front of him
[1:04:17] let me standing in his presence there
[1:04:19] and his servant
[1:04:21] and of all our child that's the best I
[1:04:23] can do
[1:04:25] I hope God
[1:04:27] what good did it do me
[1:04:31] what good did he do all the crying and
[1:04:33] begging and persuading and the great
[1:04:35] signs and wonders and miracles that you
[1:04:37] showed and how I stood there and go home
[1:04:39] and cry after preaching to him and
[1:04:40] things and what good did it do man
[1:04:43] and then I have to present something
[1:04:45] like that for you for a bride
[1:04:48] and as I stood there looking she passed
[1:04:51] on by and you can imagine the back part
[1:04:53] of her with nothing on
[1:04:55] holding this in front of her as she went
[1:04:57] Shinning by like that to this twist
[1:05:00] throwing her limbs out like that and her
[1:05:01] oh it was vulgar how she was carrying on
[1:05:04] her body shaking around like that
[1:05:07] I I you say what does it mean brother I
[1:05:10] don't know I'm just telling you what
[1:05:11] I've seen
[1:05:13] and when she passed by like that I
[1:05:16] looked at her oh I just got real pain I
[1:05:18] just turned around and thought God I'm
[1:05:20] condemned there's no need to be trying
[1:05:22] anything I just might as well quit
[1:05:25] Miss Carl Williams if you're sitting
[1:05:26] here in that dream that you told me
[1:05:28] about a while ago that you had the other
[1:05:29] night that's been bothering you there it
[1:05:31] is
[1:05:33] the starting Wheels taken from the hands
[1:05:37] then
[1:05:39] I just thought I I just might as well
[1:05:42] forget it I was gone and all of it once
[1:05:45] I heard it coming again
[1:05:47] and coming up on the this side come the
[1:05:51] same bride that went around this way
[1:05:53] here come them little ladies again
[1:05:56] and each one of them was dressed in
[1:05:58] their National Guard from where they
[1:05:59] come from like Switzerland Germany and
[1:06:01] so forth each one wearing that kind of
[1:06:03] guard all long hair just exactly like
[1:06:05] there was the first
[1:06:07] and really was coming walking Onward
[1:06:09] Christian so marching as to war and when
[1:06:13] they'll pass by the previous stand where
[1:06:15] we were standing just all at once for
[1:06:17] every eye went that way and then they
[1:06:19] turned back home they went marching and
[1:06:22] just as they started to going right up
[1:06:24] into the skies this other one went up to
[1:06:26] the brick of the hill and went down like
[1:06:28] that these started marching right up
[1:06:30] into the sky
[1:06:32] and when they went to marching I noticed
[1:06:34] a couple of little girls in the back
[1:06:35] looked like they might be of some
[1:06:37] foreign girl like Sweden or Switzerland
[1:06:40] or somewhere they started to look around
[1:06:42] and got I said don't do that
[1:06:44] don't get out of Step It is a screen
[1:06:47] like that I come to a division center of
[1:06:49] my hand out like that
[1:06:52] I thought well
[1:06:55] that's the reason I said what I have
[1:06:58] tonight
[1:06:59] I want to ask you a question
[1:07:02] is it later than we think
[1:07:06] could she already be called and chosen
[1:07:10] sealed away
[1:07:13] there won't be one extra one you know
[1:07:16] could it be possible oh yes
[1:07:20] no man
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:25] amen
[1:07:29] be your chosen generation a royal
[1:07:31] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[1:07:33] people
[1:07:34] that you should show forth the Praises
[1:07:36] for him who have called you out of
[1:07:38] Darkness into Marvelous Light
[1:07:41] we heard so many things that the prophet
[1:07:44] has said to us and I think this is the
[1:07:46] most striking thing in the most sobering
[1:07:48] moment I had even within this week
[1:07:52] is that a prophet that preached so many
[1:07:54] servers
[1:07:55] so many services prayed for so many
[1:07:57] people
[1:07:59] would feel ashamed to choose a bride for
[1:08:02] Christ
[1:08:05] but the nice thing about this and don't
[1:08:07] lose hope and don't think different as
[1:08:10] there was a bride that was walking
[1:08:12] instead
[1:08:15] but we'll we'll go to Genesis 19 if you
[1:08:19] want to go and follow me there we want
[1:08:20] to talk about and it we're going to
[1:08:22] finish this because we definitely have
[1:08:24] the answer
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:28] amen but sometimes it's good
[1:08:30] to just stop
[1:08:32] and sober up for it for a second
[1:08:35] just shake it all or shake the world off
[1:08:38] get back
[1:08:40] to where we leave Christ
[1:08:43] get back to to Our Roots which we are
[1:08:46] and who we are because if you know who
[1:08:48] you are and you know how God sees you
[1:08:50] then the things of the world don't
[1:08:52] matter
[1:08:54] we we go here in an angel's visit to
[1:08:57] Lord wegothi from verse 4. it says
[1:08:59] so so lot finds himself in Sodom and
[1:09:03] Gomorrah and he's at the gate and he's
[1:09:04] busy he's a he's a judge
[1:09:08] and so the two angels come to him and he
[1:09:12] falls at their feet and says my lords
[1:09:14] because he knew they were angels and he
[1:09:17] invites them into his house
[1:09:19] but see the state of the city let's read
[1:09:22] in verse 4 see it's before they laid
[1:09:24] down
[1:09:25] the men of the city even the men of
[1:09:27] Sodom compassed the house round and
[1:09:30] about old and young all the people from
[1:09:32] every quarter and they called lot and
[1:09:35] they said unto him where are the men
[1:09:37] which came unto thee this night bring
[1:09:40] them out unto us so we may know them
[1:09:43] so they didn't want to be their friends
[1:09:46] see brother Brandon picks this up as
[1:09:48] well and he says that the woman
[1:09:50] lost their value in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:09:54] they lost their purpose for the woman of
[1:09:57] Sodom and Gomorrah now I want to ask you
[1:10:00] something it's a simple question has
[1:10:02] this world currently not lost the
[1:10:06] purpose of a woman
[1:10:07] when you get transgenders and and
[1:10:10] lesbians and all these type of things
[1:10:12] and you speak to them and people that is
[1:10:14] now General neutral and the the people
[1:10:17] asked him what is a mother that they
[1:10:20] can't answer them
[1:10:21] they can't tell them what the dictionary
[1:10:24] says a mother is or a woman is they
[1:10:27] cannot tell them the answer
[1:10:29] isn't this the very same situation we're
[1:10:32] living right in now
[1:10:33] it is later than we think
[1:10:39] so a lot reasons with these guys and
[1:10:41] he's trying to save these angels and if
[1:10:43] you go to the next verse he says and lot
[1:10:46] lot went out the door unto them and shut
[1:10:48] the door after him
[1:10:49] and he said I pray you Brethren do not
[1:10:51] so wickedly behold now I have two
[1:10:54] daughters which have not known Men Let
[1:10:57] me I pray you bring them out unto you
[1:10:59] that you
[1:11:01] um that and you do what is good in your
[1:11:03] eyes only these two men do nothing for
[1:11:06] therefore they are under my shadow of my
[1:11:08] roof
[1:11:11] so I'm asking you
[1:11:13] they've lost all reasoning this city of
[1:11:16] a lot
[1:11:17] how many people that we testify to
[1:11:21] that you talk about God Miracles things
[1:11:23] happening and they blind to it
[1:11:26] it is the same day we're living in
[1:11:29] and it's a horrible day but it's time
[1:11:32] that we get sobered up because if you
[1:11:34] get into the wave of the world you just
[1:11:37] drift along we we ain't driftwood
[1:11:40] we are trees planted By the Waters we're
[1:11:43] not Driftwood We Don't Drift with the
[1:11:45] world
[1:11:47] we're not
[1:11:49] and the day you stand at the Judgment
[1:11:52] you will be glad that you stood for this
[1:11:54] word because this word is going to stand
[1:11:56] for you that day
[1:11:58] so yes you are a peculiar people you are
[1:12:01] a real royal priesthood you are
[1:12:03] different and that's fine but see you
[1:12:07] have authority with God because as much
[1:12:09] as all these things look bleak
[1:12:11] it's just a current status of the world
[1:12:14] but that's not who you are
[1:12:17] because when God sent to choose a bride
[1:12:19] when he said that bride and he took his
[1:12:22] scepter and he reached it out for you
[1:12:24] and he says touch it he gave you half
[1:12:26] the kingdom he made you a co-heir with
[1:12:28] Christ you have privileges
[1:12:31] you have rights
[1:12:33] but see the world just wants to lull you
[1:12:35] to sleep so you forget about them
[1:12:37] you you forget about who you are you
[1:12:40] forget about who you us husband really
[1:12:42] are you actually forget that he is
[1:12:44] Almighty Sovereign God and no one can
[1:12:47] stand before him nothing can stand
[1:12:49] before him in his holy presence that is
[1:12:52] your husband that is your equal
[1:12:55] because remember you didn't lift
[1:12:57] yourself up he went to the Cross took
[1:13:00] your sin so that you could be coerced
[1:13:01] with him nothing you could do but you
[1:13:03] find yourself as the bride of Christ
[1:13:05] being called
[1:13:06] so when spirits of depression come or
[1:13:09] when anger come malice Strife lust
[1:13:12] Spirits all these things all these
[1:13:13] Devils come at you trying to to attack
[1:13:16] you do you know who you are
[1:13:20] do you know who is your husband
[1:13:23] and do you know that your husband is so
[1:13:25] close to you he dwells right within you
[1:13:28] so sometimes we pray into the ceiling
[1:13:30] and we think God can't hear us he's not
[1:13:32] above the ceiling he's not far removed
[1:13:35] from us he's a very present help in a
[1:13:38] time of need
[1:13:40] but see it's easy for us to forget our
[1:13:42] privilege
[1:13:43] it's easy for us to forget the promises
[1:13:45] and the power of it
[1:13:47] but why because we're busy being lulled
[1:13:50] asleep
[1:13:52] so that little bride at the end when she
[1:13:55] was walking and she started looking
[1:13:57] around
[1:13:58] she wasn't looking around at anything
[1:14:00] else but those people that were going
[1:14:02] down there
[1:14:03] and I'm telling you now it's God's word
[1:14:06] or the world that's the two
[1:14:09] hello
[1:14:10] that there is no other
[1:14:12] Satan's Eden God's Eden
[1:14:15] okay there is no other so if you're
[1:14:17] focusing on the world you're getting out
[1:14:18] of Step
[1:14:19] get back into State you have time right
[1:14:22] now the train is in the blocks the light
[1:14:24] is flashing so I was praying today when
[1:14:26] I went I went to see someone
[1:14:28] and I was praying and I was just talking
[1:14:30] to the Lord in the car and I said Lord
[1:14:31] should I talk about this tonight and
[1:14:34] guess where I stopped brother Ed
[1:14:37] there at the gates at the trade Gates
[1:14:39] and the light was flashing red and the
[1:14:42] gates came and I looked for the train
[1:14:43] ago at the trades are here and it's
[1:14:46] exactly what brother Branham says he
[1:14:48] says even if you don't see that train
[1:14:50] it is coming

[1:14:54] want to go over that rail you're going

[1:15:08] Twitter and all those other stuff we
[1:15:09] don't have time for that there's no time
[1:15:11] for it it's a waste of your time

[1:15:32] something that's got nutrition and you
[1:15:33] can chew and you can fill and you can
[1:15:35] feel filled because when you do this
[1:15:38] you're still a shallow and as Hollow as
[1:15:40] what you were before you started it
[1:15:42] cut those things I'm always going to
[1:15:44] preach again said I hate a cell phone I
[1:15:47] hate computers it is good in them but
[1:15:49] most of it that I have found is evil
[1:15:52] it's a distraction it is out of the pit
[1:15:54] of Hell why does the Apple have an apple
[1:15:56] that is bitten anyways can you not see
[1:15:58] it yeah
[1:16:00] yeah can you not see it
[1:16:02] Satan is so blase he's like oh I don't
[1:16:05] care I'll even I'll even show them a
[1:16:07] billboard with an apple that's bitten
[1:16:09] because he fell for an apple did she now
[1:16:12] that's how he is he's so arrogant but if
[1:16:15] you knew who you have and you know that
[1:16:18] he is Haman and you know who you are oh
[1:16:21] Lord
[1:16:23] you just call the King on the scene and
[1:16:25] it's over and he'll hang him by his own
[1:16:26] Gallow hey man he made for himself amen
[1:16:30] so let's go I'm going to finish with
[1:16:31] this Isaiah 59 let's go there
[1:16:34] oh man let me lose sight now I'm really
[1:16:36] now I want to preach
[1:16:38] because the thing is you know what makes
[1:16:40] me happy
[1:16:41] okay what makes me happy is if a child
[1:16:43] of God
[1:16:44] realizes who he is and who she is and
[1:16:48] all of a sudden there's a excitement
[1:16:51] there's the excitement you can see that
[1:16:53] the veil has come off that that
[1:16:55] blindness and they start sobering up and
[1:16:58] when you talk to them you're actually
[1:16:59] hearing the Lord speak back to you
[1:17:01] because he's now cleaned out vessel he's
[1:17:04] ready for service and God starts talking
[1:17:06] through a brother that was so thick and
[1:17:09] sin this day and the next day he goes
[1:17:10] man the Lord showed me this in the
[1:17:12] scripture here like okay
[1:17:15] thank you Lord It's Only God that can do
[1:17:18] it but you need to wake up
[1:17:22] amen let's go Isaiah 59 and we go to
[1:17:26] verse 19.
[1:17:28] the spirit of the Lord raises that
[1:17:30] standard who knows the scripture
[1:17:32] okay so yes the world's evil yes it's
[1:17:36] lot yes it's Sodom well what's God going
[1:17:39] to do right now let's read There He says
[1:17:41] so shall they fear my name
[1:17:44] of the Lord from the West and his glory
[1:17:47] from the rising of the sun when the
[1:17:50] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:17:51] spirit of the Lord will lift up a
[1:17:53] standard against it and remember
[1:17:55] and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and
[1:17:58] unto them that turn from transgressions
[1:18:01] in Jacob
[1:18:03] say is the Lord as for me this is my
[1:18:07] Covenant which them say with them save
[1:18:09] the Lord my spirit is now listen to this
[1:18:11] my spirit is upon thee and my words is
[1:18:16] worth Thee I have put them in thy mouth
[1:18:19] who is doing the work here
[1:18:23] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[1:18:26] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[1:18:28] the mouth of thy seed seed who's got
[1:18:31] children they want to come back to the
[1:18:33] Lord yes yes what does the Lord saying
[1:18:36] he says it will not go from this seed
[1:18:38] seed
[1:18:39] so as long as you remember that
[1:18:41] scripture it will not depart out of my
[1:18:43] life it will not the part of my it
[1:18:45] doesn't matter what the obvious States
[1:18:47] it will not depart out of my life
[1:18:51] and out of my mouth because God has put
[1:18:54] those words there and if God has done it
[1:18:57] it is a finished work
[1:18:58] don't doubt it just believe amen amen
[1:19:03] he says no out of the mouth of thy seed
[1:19:05] seed saves the Lord for hence more and
[1:19:08] forever there is no period
[1:19:12] there's no limitation we go on Isaiah 60
[1:19:15] the Lord Glory rests on Israel it says
[1:19:18] arise and shine for the light of come
[1:19:20] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:19:23] thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover
[1:19:25] the Earth gross Darkness the people but
[1:19:28] the Lord shall arise upon a cell arise
[1:19:31] upon thee and His glory shall be seen
[1:19:34] upon thee
[1:19:37] now I want to tell you when you sober up
[1:19:40] and you start realizing who you are and
[1:19:43] who your husband is it you don't need to
[1:19:46] do anything but grow closer to him
[1:19:48] and go for safety and pray and read your
[1:19:52] Bible and get to know your your savior
[1:19:54] get to get to know your husband and then
[1:19:56] when all those difficult things you know
[1:19:58] I couldn't stop smoking
[1:20:01] I said to Brother Andy I love smoking
[1:20:04] ask him correct
[1:20:06] in his house
[1:20:08] but see the Lord was starting to deal
[1:20:10] with me
[1:20:12] and he started to giving me a heart of
[1:20:14] Flesh and not this Old Smoky Stony heart
[1:20:18] and then one day I just started finding
[1:20:20] out this is this is just not going to
[1:20:22] work for me
[1:20:24] and I and I say to my wife I'm going to
[1:20:26] stop smoking and I took my cigarettes
[1:20:28] and I let three cigarettes smoked them
[1:20:30] in a space for five minutes and I'm like
[1:20:31] I'm done smoking and I've said this
[1:20:33] millions of times
[1:20:34] but this time the Lord was doing the
[1:20:36] work
[1:20:38] and for the next 21 days you know it was
[1:20:40] harder to drive past because don't say
[1:20:42] it's not a battle it is a battle
[1:20:44] everything is a battle you're gonna
[1:20:46] fight but we're warriors we've got we've
[1:20:49] got so many demon no it's called Zia
[1:20:52] that's been cracked by These Hands by
[1:20:53] fighting hey and stomped under your feet
[1:20:55] my my soul's got calluses on them
[1:20:57] already because they don't they come
[1:20:59] back up because they're a spirit but you
[1:21:02] stomp them back down
[1:21:04] because your old nature brother Branham
[1:21:06] said is just behind you and it will be
[1:21:08] there till the day you change this body
[1:21:10] and that old nature always wants to come
[1:21:13] back yes and your job is to be so
[1:21:16] surrendered that you go Lord you sort
[1:21:18] out my old nature because I want the new
[1:21:20] nature because you cannot sort that guy
[1:21:23] out he is not tameable okay he's gonna
[1:21:26] be that old nature will go but your new
[1:21:28] nature the real you that's the one we're
[1:21:30] working with so I found myself not
[1:21:32] smoking but while I did that I found
[1:21:35] myself not drinking while I did that I
[1:21:37] found my music taste changed my change

[1:21:43] conversation changed I had a prayer
[1:21:45] meeting on a Friday night in my house
[1:21:49] you tell me that 20 years ago I would
[1:21:51] have gone you've got to be joking me
[1:21:54] because when people used to say for me I
[1:21:56] pray for you I thought it was an insult
[1:21:58] I did that's what the world thinks
[1:22:00] because they're so blind
[1:22:02] but see now the Lord says here I will
[1:22:05] shine my light upon you so now there's
