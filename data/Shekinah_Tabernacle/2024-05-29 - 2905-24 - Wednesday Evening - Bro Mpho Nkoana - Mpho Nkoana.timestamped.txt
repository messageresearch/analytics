[27:37] you for being here tonight and uh we are
[27:40] going to speak on a small subject not
[27:42] small but just a short seron and uh I've
[27:46] tried to minimize it as much as I could
[27:49] I didn't finish the whole seron myself
[27:51] but we'll just take a little journey as
[27:54] we as we read in the Book of Luke
[27:56] chapter 7 um um I pray you under
[27:59] expectation tonight not because brother
[28:02] Paul but because you are prayed up and
[28:04] you've asked the Lord Lord come and
[28:06] speak to me even if it's just one word
[28:10] and then I'll try to to not to be
[28:14] dramatic so that you can understand me
[28:16] so that you can follow what the Lord is
[28:18] trying to say amen and uh uh Luke
[28:22] chapter 7 amen then we'll read from
[28:25] verse 36 then then we will sit down and
[28:29] continue with other verses
[28:32] amen um Luke 7 verse 36 it's a little
[28:37] bit of a long passage but please just
[28:40] bear with me because I need to paint a
[28:42] certain picture for
[28:44] you you all know the
[28:46] scripture and then it it reads that and
[28:50] one day I mean sorry and one of the
[28:52] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[28:55] with
[28:56] him he desired him right and he went
[29:01] into the Pharisees house and he sat down
[29:04] to
[29:06] meet and behold a woman in the city
[29:09] which was a sinner which she knew that
[29:12] Jesus set at meat in the phes house
[29:15] brought an alabaster box of
[29:20] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[29:23] him weeping and began to wash his feet
[29:26] with tears
[29:28] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[29:32] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[29:35] them with the
[29:38] ointment and now when the Pharisee which
[29:41] had bidden him saw it ah he saw
[29:46] it he spake within
[29:49] himself saying this man if he were a
[29:53] prophet would have known who and what
[29:57] manner of woman this is that touches his
[30:01] feet that toucheth him for she is a
[30:04] sinner can you see already you're
[30:07] already seeing two personalities the one
[30:09] of this woman and the one that is
[30:11] emerging of this man who desired Jesus
[30:14] to come but he's already doubting that
[30:17] he's a prophet or not so you're starting
[30:19] to have question marks there put on your
[30:21] spiritual jackets like brother marus
[30:23] said am where was I
[30:26] verse let's go to 40 and Jesus answering
[30:29] said unto him I I don't know if Jesus
[30:33] had him with this ears this ears because
[30:36] the Bible says he said in
[30:39] himself but Jesus answering him after
[30:43] this man spoke inside his heart another
[30:46] personality you are seeing you are
[30:48] seeing another person again let's hear
[30:50] what what he said when he's answering
[30:52] him for what he said inside his
[30:55] heart said unto him Simon I have
[30:58] somewhat to say unto thee and he said
[31:02] Master say
[31:04] on what a contradiction you just said in
[31:07] your heart this man if he be a prophet
[31:10] he'll know this woman but no no no no
[31:13] master master master say on who
[31:18] Master amen there was a certain creditor
[31:23] which had two DTS and one owed 500 p p
[31:28] and the other
[31:30] 50 and when they had nothing to pay he
[31:33] frankly forgave them both tell me
[31:36] therefore which of them will love will
[31:39] love him most I think let's pause here
[31:43] pray and then sit down then then we'll
[31:45] start our drama amen our lord
[31:49] Jesus God most high we thank you tonight
[31:52] for your loving kindness for your mercy
[31:56] for your grace for your your salvation
[31:59] for your Redemption for your healing for
[32:02] your love we thank you for your thoughts
[32:05] about us tonight and Heavenly Father we
[32:09] cannot Lord think enough of what you
[32:12] have done at the cross of Calvary and
[32:16] father you died for my sins to be
[32:19] forgiven for me to be called a Christian
[32:22] and you suffered alone and you died
[32:25] because Lord you loved us so much that
[32:27] you could not leave us to go to hell
[32:31] father we come with thankful Hearts
[32:32] tonight and we come in your presence
[32:35] here realizing that we are

[32:41] grace and I ask father God that you
[32:44] forgive us our iniquity forgive our
[32:47] errors and our mistakes we want to be
[32:49] honest and open with you father God that
[32:52] tonight we are not capable but father we

[33:06] that you provide for them according to
[33:08] the desires of their hearts Lord that
[33:10] you speak to them Lord according to
[33:12] their needs father for you we hear from
[33:15] the Bible that you hear people speaking
[33:18] in their hearts and you answer them
[33:21] openly my father my God how blessed are

[36:23] you are a dedicated believer yeah right
[36:26] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[36:29] he to whom he forgave most and he said
[36:32] unto him thou has rightly judged and he
[36:35] turned to the woman and said unto said
[36:38] unto Simon seest thou this woman I
[36:41] entered into this house thou gave gavest
[36:45] me no water for my
[36:47] feet but she had washed my feet with
[36:50] tears and wiped them with te with the
[36:52] hairs of her head thou gavest me no keys
[36:56] but this woman see since the time I came
[36:58] in with in have not ceased to kiss my
[37:04] feet my head with oil
[37:07] thou didn't not anoint but this woman
[37:10] had anointed my feet with ointment
[37:14] wherefore I say unto her unto thee her
[37:17] sins which are
[37:19] many are forgiven for she loved much but
[37:24] to whom little is given the same loveth
[37:28] little did I read it correctly and he
[37:31] said unto her thy sins are
[37:34] forgiven now and they that sat at meat
[37:37] with him began to say within themselves
[37:40] again within themselves who is this that
[37:44] forgiveth sins also and he said to the
[37:48] woman Al alier means
[37:51] again thy faith had saved thee go in
[37:55] peace amen so we we see a story here I
[37:58] want to to dramatize it a little bit and
[38:01] then we go home but we see a story or we
[38:04] see this record of this woman and this
[38:07] Simon the Pharisee and the Lord Jesus
[38:11] and we want to talk I want to talk to
[38:12] you about the UN the unwelcomed Jesus
[38:17] Christ the unwelcomed Jesus I know that
[38:20] you welcome him and tonight maybe if I
[38:24] can say something that uh you you are
[38:28] not so comfortable about just know that
[38:31] I love you I don't mean to to be rude or
[38:35] I don't mean to be hard on you and uh
[38:38] just just just forgive me and but don't
[38:41] throw away just take it then go home and
[38:45] play and Rewind and listen to it and
[38:48] maybe by the grace of God you can see
[38:51] what I was trying to show you don't
[38:53] don't throw it away if I'm reading from
[38:56] the word of the Lord okay
[38:58] so H because why why am I saying this
[39:02] you are not the ones that are not
[39:04] welcoming him but hey we have to be
[39:08] cauti from time to time be reminded we
[39:11] have to be made aware that there are
[39:14] these Spirits let's read Timothy second
[39:17] Timothy 3:
[39:21] 6 May God help us is it possible to put
[39:25] it there my dear sister tell thank you
[39:27] so much there it is 2 Timothy
[39:31] 3:6 sorry I I meant to say 16 forgive me
[39:36] 16 thank you all scripture is given by
[39:39] inspiration of God I just want us to
[39:42] agree and put this these three
[39:44] scriptures aside and just agree as the
[39:46] basis all scripture is given by is given
[39:50] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[39:53] meaning
[39:55] beneficial for Doctrine for reprove for
[39:59] correction for instruction in
[40:02] righteousness so I don't think that list
[40:04] is
[40:06] finished is for comforting is for
[40:08] encouraging you is for healing you is
[40:11] for saving you is for everything for you
[40:14] don't you sing a song He's everything to
[40:16] me he's everything to me so the word of
[40:19] God is meant for all those things to
[40:22] you can we set that that one aside let's
[40:26] read Revelation 3
[40:28] verse 19 rev
[40:30] 3:19 when I say rev I think of my sister
[40:33] because her name is revelation so is the
[40:36] Revelation Revelation 3
[40:40] verse
[40:43] 19 sorry my girl I'm depending on you
[40:46] tonight I'm not going to page a
[40:48] lot as many as I love huh you see this
[40:52] is the problem brother Ben many many and
[40:55] I'm sorry parents
[40:57] I'm I'm sorry but not really sorry I'm
[41:00] not apologetic in saying this many of
[41:02] you many of us just remember everything
[41:05] that I say
[41:06] here believe you or me believe you or
[41:10] not it comes here to me first the Lord
[41:13] speaks to me first every word that I
[41:15] utter to you the Lord talks back to me
[41:18] first I must be repenting on that right
[41:23] I must be I don't want to say also I'm
[41:25] the first one to benefit of course
[41:27] because the lord gave me a thought to
[41:29] come speak but the the key is don't
[41:32] think that ah he's preaching to us but
[41:34] what about him no it's for me too I'm
[41:36] number one cuz I'm standing here I'm
[41:39] number one right now many I wanted to
[41:42] say you see you see
[41:45] parents I've always wondered why brother
[41:47] Bram says
[41:50] uh we have a problem
[41:52] of children delinquency
[41:58] he says we've got a problem of children
[42:00] delinquency but I've realized that it's
[42:03] not much about children
[42:05] delinquency is the problem of Parental
[42:11] delinquency pause just walk with me you
[42:16] see many of us we miss the word
[42:20] correction we place it a
[42:23] Miss correction is not supposed to be on
[42:25] the two extremes
[42:28] it's not supposed to be too soft too
[42:31] spoiling oh Jimmy my boy sorry BR Jimmy
[42:35] oh little Jimmy
[42:37] Jimmy huh and you are correcting Jimmy
[42:41] to move away from the rail of the
[42:42] oncoming train Jimmy the train is going
[42:45] to knock you my big boy get off the rail
[42:48] now now okay and then you continue doing
[42:51] that huh is that
[42:54] love or so angry kick Jimmy from here to
[42:59] Across The Rail and even break his leg
[43:02] and say you don't listen you and you are
[43:04] angry is that
[43:07] love the word correction is supposed to
[43:10] be underpinned by this word called love
[43:13] yeah true genuine love you see when the
[43:15] Lord says he whom I
[43:19] love as many as I love what do I
[43:24] do or you don't want to say it only
[43:26] brother
[43:29] I
[43:30] rebuke you love me but you rebuke me yes
[43:34] but I have to make sure me the
[43:36] rebuker I've got love otherwise I must
[43:41] zip and
[43:43] zip and zip in my mind because I'm not
[43:48] going to properly correct my son if I'm
[43:51] not bringing that love inside this
[43:54] correction whether I'm doing it on this
[43:56] extreme
[43:58] or on this extreme so why why I'm saying
[44:00] many of us parents we miss it that is
[44:03] why we produce young children or adults
[44:06] who are not serious about the weight
[44:09] across the world you look many of the
[44:11] young people don't take the weight
[44:12] seriously because of us
[44:16] parents they don't have to hear you they
[44:19] just observe you they they don't even
[44:22] you don't even have to they don't even
[44:23] have to see your action sometimes the
[44:25] energy that you you a meat the life that
[44:28] you live the energy that because we Are
[44:30] Spiritual Beings you know you know you
[44:33] just look at David and then there's
[44:35] there's an energy between that's
[44:39] right just like when you love someone
[44:41] there's a chemistry amen you know a
[44:43] chemistry so there's also a chemistry
[44:46] when you do something wrong there's a
[44:49] chemistry it eventually create what is
[44:51] called an atmosphere and any spiritual
[44:54] being children included can detect that
[45:00] ah can you see what I'm saying so the
[45:02] problem is not that we are correcting
[45:04] them wrong is because we don't leave
[45:07] what we are trying to correct them about
[45:10] that's the problem and and they can't
[45:13] help it but they can pick it
[45:15] up and then it brings the fruits of
[45:18] adults who Foundation is skew or their
[45:21] their house is skew the problem it's not
[45:25] like children are are Scot free is that
[45:27] the right word no no but the problem the
[45:31] foundation you see Paul said I've laid a
[45:33] foundation and everyone who's going to
[45:36] be building must build on this
[45:38] foundation and we are supposed to be now
[45:40] they've come and gone and we are
[45:42] supposed to be on the same foundation
[45:44] not just with words but with our lives
[45:46] too that's right that's
[45:50] right God bless you parents you love mej
[45:57] um it's because he said he said it's not
[46:00] me who wrote that the Lord said that
[46:03] it's because he loves you so much
[46:04] imagine the owner of a flock of sheep
[46:07] just going to e sister na break his leg
[46:10] is that
[46:11] love on the physical part is not but the
[46:15] true fact of the matter is that he went
[46:19] through the hills and the mountains in
[46:21] the Snows and everywhere
[46:24] suffering and breaking
[46:27] his feet and everything to find this
[46:29] sheep which did not
[46:31] listen when he find it out of
[46:35] love I always say to my kids hey come
[46:37] let me give you a px with a
[46:41] smile they say a px with a smile is very
[46:44] painful cuz it's like you enjoying
[46:47] this no no I'm I I don't want to be
[46:50] angry I want to hit you with my
[46:55] love Fair
[46:59] okay but on brothers and sisters we are
[47:03] supposed to be leaders by
[47:06] example not only by our talk but by the
[47:10] energy that we we emit the the
[47:12] atmosphere that we create
[47:16] so let's go to First Peter 5 just going

[47:24] while first Peter my sister first Peter

[48:22] humble yourself therefore under the
[48:24] mighty hand of God that he he may exalt
[48:28] you in due time right casting all your
[48:33] care upon him for he carth for you you
[48:38] agree amen verse eight be sober be
[48:43] vigilant because your adversary the
[48:46] devil as a roaring lion walth about
[48:51] seeking whom he may devour and that's
[48:53] the verse I want to to tell you why I
[48:55] was quoting re the Revelation and the
[48:58] other scripture because you see the
[49:00] devil the devil has got no somebody made
[49:03] a statement one time he said the Devil
[49:05] is a full-time Devil he's going around
[49:08] you where when you say the devil is
[49:10] going around you sometimes we just think
[49:12] about here on Earth he's lering around
[49:14] here looking no no he's going around
[49:16] even around your spirit around your soul
[49:19] where the faith of God is you a daughter
[49:21] and a son of God he's going around there
[49:24] the next thing you find him on your
[49:25] imagination you find him on your
[49:27] affection on your memory on your
[49:29] conscious you he's going around you he's
[49:31] going around you looking to devour you
[49:34] to devour that Faith because he knows
[49:36] you are a son and a daughter of God
[49:38] there's no question about that but he's
[49:40] going around you day in day out sleeping
[49:46] awake he's going around you he's going
[49:49] around you with the thoughts in the mind
[49:52] he's going around you looking how he can
[49:56] devour you
[49:57] whe from any angle he's got you on a
[49:59] dash a big screen a dashboard he
[50:02] analyzes you daily your weaknesses your
[50:05] strength your grow he's the he got the
[50:07] ratios of how you grow how you read your
[50:09] Bible how you it's got every analysis
[50:12] you can think about about you so that is
[50:15] going around you day and night but hey
[50:19] be of good courage
[50:22] because there is a
[50:24] confirmation he while he's seeking whom
[50:27] he can Devour the Bible gave a solution
[50:30] that hey
[50:31] simple seek ye first the kingdom of God
[50:33] stay in the presence of God at all times
[50:36] he cannot do anything be in the
[50:39] atmosphere of the Lord simple things
[50:42] like praying every day reading your
[50:43] Bible every day being in the right
[50:46] atmosphere of the
[50:48] Lord come what may come whatever THS he
[50:51] throws or darts they shall not
[50:54] Prosper any weapon that will be thrown
[50:57] to you cannot Prosper it will only
[50:59] Prosper if you open a gap you forgot the
[51:03] lion is going around you now let's hear
[51:06] about this unwelcomed Christ by this man
[51:09] because we know the story we even know
[51:11] about that woman right so let's just go
[51:14] a little bit and just here we find that
[51:17] Jesus went to this Pharisee knowing very
[51:20] well the behavior of this Pharisee Jesus
[51:23] was a prophet he knew and he was was
[51:26] greater than the prophet he knew that
[51:28] this man who is inviting him he's going
[51:31] to put him at a a garage is even better
[51:35] in the storage there the corner corner
[51:37] corner
[51:38] there he knew but one thing about Jesus
[51:42] Christ is that whenever you invite him
[51:45] he
[51:45] come even if you know that you're are
[51:47] going to embarrass and harass him and
[51:50] put him in a corner and do all sorts of
[51:53] funny monkey shenanigames and anything
[51:56] he knows he knows even if you're genuine
[51:59] and you're going to forget about him and
[52:02] even when you he knows when you only
[52:05] come to him when you need help he knows
[52:07] Jesus Christ knows but you know one
[52:09] thing about him he never says Ah no I'm
[52:11] tired with
[52:12] you when you invite him he comes because
[52:16] he wants to give everyone and every
[52:19] opportunity to come and take for free so
[52:24] he went
[52:29] knowing that he's not going to welcome
[52:32] him even though he invited him he still
[52:36] went now let's read here what the
[52:38] prophet says you see what the first
[52:40] thing that you need to know about the
[52:42] Pharisee is
[52:45] that
[52:46] a a farise the prophet here in this
[52:50] message of unwelcomed
[52:53] Christ he says preached in 1955 I I
[52:56] think there was three or four serons the
[52:58] one of
[53:00] 55091
[53:02] 55091 far see the first thing I want you
[53:06] to know what a Pharisee means a Pharisee
[53:09] means an
[53:12] actor find the Greek word of Pharisee it
[53:15] means somebody that's
[53:17] acting and the prophet says I don't like
[53:20] that somebody who's trying to be what
[53:22] he's
[53:24] not you see that is why h Ood is so
[53:27] popular in today's economy because it's
[53:31] full of
[53:33] actors they act they become
[53:37] imagine if your your character in in the
[53:40] drama you always given to be a wife how
[53:43] many people you would have kissed at the
[53:45] end of your 100 movie that you
[53:49] made you're kissing
[53:52] them in this
[53:54] movie you're acting because you are in
[53:58] Hollywood right so I just gave that
[54:01] example because someone
[54:05] said and this is may be this may be a
[54:08] hard
[54:09] one you're watching a movie of people
[54:15] kissing and they are not husband and
[54:17] wife they're Ting they are Pharisees you
[54:19] are watching them and they
[54:23] kissing what do you think happens to you
[54:32] I'll just leave that one there but that
[54:34] was not my main point a pH is an actor
[54:38] we have too much of that in America it's
[54:42] true actors pretending to be something
[54:45] that you are not acting like something
[54:47] that you are
[54:48] so he knew that he did not mean to
[54:52] invite the Lord he knew actually that he
[54:54] hates him he hated him but he's still in
[54:58] because he wanted to embarrass him he
[55:00] wanted to expose him he wanted to do all
[55:01] sorts of things to make fun of him I can
[55:05] see them coming after the Lord accepted
[55:08] I can see the preparations of the
[55:10] banquet I can see the estas the 6s 600s
[55:15] coming there and The Limousines The
[55:17] Cadillacs and the
[55:19] mays coming on the day at the veranda of
[55:22] the Pharisee coming Great Men of renown
[55:25] coming because he was a rich man yeah I
[55:29] can see them coming and each one gets
[55:31] welcomed get wiped oiled everything
[55:35] given every everything for a wedding
[55:36] because they important I mean for the
[55:38] banet they are important people I can
[55:40] see him boastfully walking around
[55:43] preparing for this great event to take
[55:46] place I can see him you know people
[55:49] given wine glasses what what you know
[55:52] from France what are the names of the
[55:54] ones but arm you know he was in that
[55:56] business before sorry not he he he was
[55:59] in that business not that he was
[56:00] drinking but he'll know he'll give me
[56:02] he'll give you a French name for a wine
[56:06] H so he was there this man and boasting
[56:11] around and and and the Lord also
[56:15] came came and then
[56:20] they probably used that they used the
[56:23] big door that door you know the was
[56:26] those guys at by the door and by the
[56:27] gate by the Vera that were muscled up
[56:30] there were bouncers you know a bouncer
[56:32] yeah those guys like
[56:35] you I don't even know how to do
[56:38] that were wearing suits and duck sasses
[56:41] and red
[56:43] ties and they had things here talking
[56:46] about who's coming that's right back
[56:48] door back door yep over talking
[56:51] discussing and then the Lord they
[56:54] welcomed him then they showed him that
[56:56] that room to go to that storage where he
[56:59] can maybe see from a far off
[57:03] and yet he was an invited there was a
[57:07] messenger a CER the prophet calls him a
[57:09] flank who rushed for maybe he was on the
[57:12] other Hill that side of Mara then from
[57:17] upper heart going to go and invite the
[57:19] Lord and he invited him and he he worked
[57:22] very hard to get through the disciples
[57:25] he persisted because the master the
[57:27] Pharisee Simon sent him and the Lord
[57:30] accepted and when the Lord arrived
[57:33] there he already prepared that when he
[57:37] come the so-called
[57:40] Prophet show him that sign wow okay
[57:44] wow and then the Lord said
[57:48] there before we go there let me just
[57:51] read a few more quotes and then we will
[57:54] finish quote number two from the same
[57:58] message oh yeah this is what I was
[58:00] telling you he hated him he didn't love
[58:04] him everything that the Pharisee does
[58:07] I'm sorry to be hard on the far
[58:09] everything that the Pharisee does you
[58:11] must know you must take the
[58:12] opposite if he says I love you you know
[58:15] that he doesn't love
[58:17] you a Pharisee because he's not himself
[58:21] he's acting he he's acting up on
[58:24] everything that he so he hated him but
[58:28] he say
[58:29] master he just short off saying my
[58:31] master say say it
[58:35] on now why would he be asking him to his
[58:39] dinner for guests when he hated him
[58:42] usually men ask one another to for
[58:45] dinner when they love one another but
[58:47] this Pharisee inviting Jesus but yet he
[58:50] doesn't he that this didn't look right
[58:53] he hates him invites him
[58:56] because people of different categories
[58:59] you know there's a word that says Bears
[59:01] of the same
[59:02] feather Christians we go together
[59:06] because we are beds of the same feather
[59:09] non-christians until when they smoke
[59:12] they scave you your
[59:14] smoke and give your brother because they
[59:18] they appreciate one another he doesn't
[59:21] mind to suck the speit of his friend
[59:24] because they are best of the same
[59:25] feather
[59:26] they they go together yeah they they
[59:29] smoke they
[59:30] share under normal
[59:33] circumstances that cannot happen it's
[59:35] because of the admiration for one they
[59:38] are BS of the now Christians children
[59:40] you know children I've never seen
[59:42] children when we all come together you
[59:45] know H Mo and ab running around and
[59:48] kicking each other only brother
[59:52] armandas did you ever see them playing
[59:54] tou touch and then also Isaac is running
[59:57] with them and kicking each other or

[1:01:53] see right quote next quote you don't
[1:01:57] only find it around on strees you find
[1:01:59] it in the pull pit what the spirit of
[1:02:03] phism this is a hard one for us the
[1:02:07] spirit of Pharisees you find it on the
[1:02:12] pulpit you get the fellows go in the
[1:02:14] Pulpit they get a Pulpit voice well I
[1:02:19] tell you Brethren a Pulpit voice
[1:02:23] acting Pharisees hypocrite talk like you
[1:02:26] you do on the street when when when you
[1:02:29] are at school you my brother young
[1:02:32] friend when you are with your group talk
[1:02:36] the same way as you are in church you
[1:02:39] see if you can find someone who can tell
[1:02:41] you something about someone but they're
[1:02:44] not ready to say that thing when that
[1:02:46] person comes you know they are
[1:02:49] Pharisees someone tells me yesterday he
[1:02:52] says Ah the person who talks about other
[1:02:54] people at my work
[1:02:56] I know it's the so and so he's the one
[1:02:58] who reports all of
[1:02:59] us I said to myself hey man if that guy
[1:03:02] comes here will you talk like
[1:03:05] that if you're not ready to speak that
[1:03:08] that we are saying about David telling
[1:03:11] brother
[1:03:13] col if you not ready that if David comes
[1:03:15] here you later you do that you are a
[1:03:20] phe or you are not a Pharisee but be
[1:03:23] careful of the spirit of
[1:03:25] just to say you a Pharisee is too hard
[1:03:27] is let me not put it that way I I
[1:03:29] withraw that one let me say be careful
[1:03:31] of the spirit because you have to be
[1:03:33] able to speak the same thing that you
[1:03:36] are saying that brother brother David no
[1:03:39] no no yesterday yeah he he refused to
[1:03:41] borrow me money and David comes here oh
[1:03:44] yeah here he is I was just telling my
[1:03:46] brother that you refuse to borrow me
[1:03:47] money can you see because you shouldn't
[1:03:50] be doing it with males with bad spirit
[1:03:52] with everything everything when you talk
[1:03:53] about your brother or your sister you
[1:03:55] should be something that you can say no
[1:03:57] no I meant this is what I was telling
[1:03:58] him I was not happy about you I even
[1:04:00] knew I told
[1:04:01] you you see
[1:04:04] so the spirit of far Pharisees behaves
[1:04:08] it acts all the time
[1:04:12] so um the prophet says a lot of sisters
[1:04:16] sometimes you know they like like the
[1:04:18] men they they put they put on go up to
[1:04:22] their houses hear them say this is not
[1:04:25] the sister John get over there in the
[1:04:29] corner talking to John I don't know if
[1:04:32] John is the husband or what then while
[1:04:34] she's talking like that then the phone
[1:04:36] rings hello this is Sister s so here
[1:04:40] this is's household how can I help you
[1:04:43] but she just shouted at John to sit
[1:04:49] down this is what the prophet is trying
[1:04:52] to give an example that you cannot be
[1:04:56] both sides
[1:04:58] yeah that is a spirit of that you are
[1:05:00] not welcoming Christ by doing that if
[1:05:03] you read that scripture that book of SEC
[1:05:05] Timothy H be before on top there before
[1:05:09] you go to that verse 16 if you read it
[1:05:12] you'll see all sorts of things that
[1:05:14] nowadays they are creeping into the life
[1:05:16] of a
[1:05:18] Believer those things are creeping into
[1:05:20] the life of a Believer because the devil
[1:05:23] has covered the world with iniquity is
[1:05:26] full everywhere he vomit stinking
[1:05:29] everywhere he's got no more place to put
[1:05:32] his stuff now he's going into the
[1:05:34] churches he has gone into the churches
[1:05:36] now he's coming into the life of a
[1:05:38] Believer because all the world is full
[1:05:40] of vomit and everything now he time that
[1:05:43] for the cup of iniquity to be fully full
[1:05:47] he wants to have a full full full full
[1:05:51] full coverage of his things now let's be
[1:05:55] careful
[1:05:56] that this lion going around us his
[1:05:58] iniquity let us be
[1:06:01] sealed with the spirit of the Lord our
[1:06:04] souls are sealed our Earnest expectation
[1:06:07] is already done and we are sealed and
[1:06:09] anything that happens around us it won't
[1:06:12] affect us that's right right that's what
[1:06:14] I would like us to do because this
[1:06:17] unwelcome Jesus Christ must not even be
[1:06:20] Hur Among Us how do we unwelcome him no
[1:06:25] we not going to we are not doing like
[1:06:27] what the Pharisee have done we welcome
[1:06:29] the Lord in our lives we acknowledge Him
[1:06:32] as our personal savior we get baptized
[1:06:34] for many
[1:06:36] years but our Behavior our actions Our
[1:06:40] Lives shows that ah we have put him at a
[1:06:44] corner he's in a corner in a Dusty room
[1:06:47] somewhere in this big
[1:06:50] compound only when we need we go to him
[1:06:53] May Master you know I was just thinking
[1:06:56] that you can just come and bless the
[1:06:57] food for us and open the
[1:07:01] occasion when we need him only
[1:07:04] so that is a a Pharisee spirit that we
[1:07:06] must be very careful young people
[1:07:09] elderly let's be aware and alert the
[1:07:11] Bible somewhere says Hey be wise yeah
[1:07:15] like serpents be be wise to be wise is
[1:07:19] to be alert of your environment and
[1:07:21] circumstances which you find yourself in
[1:07:24] we know we work on this world we work
[1:07:25] with unbelievers we business we do with
[1:07:28] unbelievers people who cut Corners
[1:07:30] brother Isaac we work with them so let
[1:07:33] us be wise let's pray for wisdom for God
[1:07:36] to give it to us let's pray for an an
[1:07:38] anointing every time even minute things
[1:07:41] I've seen someone even brushing their
[1:07:43] teeth they pray for that
[1:07:45] toothpaste
[1:07:47] imagine you you are so much you're not
[1:07:49] just being religious but you mean this
[1:07:52] thing that Lord we know these things
[1:07:53] have been poisoned to destroy us and you
[1:07:56] know you're the target of the devil the
[1:07:58] devil is not going to Target some people
[1:08:00] he's going to Target you Christians and
[1:08:02] your children he's what's going to do so
[1:08:05] when you pray pray hard pray for real
[1:08:07] real real and cry until you see the life
[1:08:09] of your daughter or your son changing
[1:08:12] we're going to pray and until that
[1:08:14] changes this woman that we are talking
[1:08:16] about here just to wrap up she she you
[1:08:21] know if you listen to the how the
[1:08:23] prophet dramatizes it when she heard
[1:08:25] that Jesus is there she was not invited
[1:08:28] here yeah yeah that's right she was not
[1:08:30] invited but you know what she ran home
[1:08:33] she saw an opportunity she she became
[1:08:36] wise she saw an opportunity by
[1:08:38] Revelation she saw it that Jesus is here
[1:08:40] in my Village to this man she went home
[1:08:42] quickly that's right you know she went
[1:08:45] and took all the money and everything
[1:08:47] everywhere she took all the money that
[1:08:49] she
[1:08:50] had and ran to that person there who
[1:08:54] sells all or or H

[1:09:06] yeah expensive perfume in the shop the

[1:10:07] there and she took that Alabaster Box
[1:10:10] and he was shocked and she didn't wait
[1:10:12] for him to get shocked or unshocked she
[1:10:14] took it ran when she got there to the
[1:10:18] compound brother and sister she found
[1:10:20] the bouncers you know those guys who are

[1:10:26] the more you get closer to where the
[1:10:27] banquet is it's many of them they
[1:10:31] armed they don't
[1:10:33] joke but that woman she you know with
[1:10:38] the alabaster she I think by the time

[1:10:46] finished because there were the boun
[1:10:48] house were F fighting her where's your
[1:10:50] invitation and she fought her way and

[1:11:33] service to the Lord we we read about it
[1:11:36] after she did the service to the Lord
[1:11:38] and then because the story starts from
[1:11:40] Back to Front then the Pharisee was
[1:11:43] looking and waiting for this the Lord
[1:11:45] knew all about
[1:11:48] it and then the Lord was telling him
[1:11:51] that

[1:14:12] goodies to suit a queen that's right and

[1:14:49] to look at
[1:14:51] it huh but you find a believer talking
[1:14:56] how the footprint
[1:14:58] talks there's something that the Angels
[1:15:00] don't even want to look at me and you
[1:15:03] are not supposed to be young people

[1:15:23] dreams and everything that you have it's
[1:15:25] just for a little season and you're not
[1:15:27] going to die yeah therefore be

[1:15:50] easy I want to cry and the Lord's going
[1:15:53] to those cry that crying those tears are
[1:15:56] going to be a blessing to the Lord and

[1:16:01] for your blessing don't give up don't
[1:16:03] give up easily and be easy come easy go
[1:16:06] no you have been bought with a great
[1:16:09] prize a great great prize I I'm going to
[1:16:12] I want I'm going to want to W wrap up
[1:16:14] this one so that we
[1:16:17] can
[1:16:20] pray the problem that we have and that
[1:16:23] enemy also uses to make us Pharisees is
[1:16:26] this thing called I I
[1:16:29] I he says that's I I I you know that's a
[1:16:32] disease this thing called I I
[1:16:36] I so many people get it I'll do it I did
[1:16:39] it I will me
[1:16:43] me AR is telling me about his situation
[1:16:47] or his work or his then I say oh it mean
[1:16:51] me
[1:16:53] brother it's time for me to end in his
[1:16:56] section and his need feel what he feels
[1:17:00] but I don't know I'm say even me my
[1:17:01] brother but he's not talking about me he
[1:17:04] came to me to tell me me can you see
[1:17:08] remember the devil is not going to come
[1:17:10] the Bible says he went to even he was
[1:17:11] subtle yeah to be subtle means you want
[1:17:15] to be
[1:17:16] undetected because if a snake comes with
[1:17:19] such a big noise it will be detected the
[1:17:22] devil come in a subtle way
[1:17:25] by the time you realize that is the
[1:17:27] devil you're gone yeah so be careful
[1:17:30] about these things and the only way to
[1:17:32] be careful and aware is to be in the
[1:17:35] presence of the Lord all the time
[1:17:37] there's no way there's no two ways about
[1:17:39] it you cannot do it that's right the
[1:17:42] only way is to follow what he said then
[1:17:46] you'll find out that without no effort
[1:17:48] without no hard work you come out
[1:17:52] right because the word of God is got a
[1:17:54] force behind it amen he called Power
[1:17:57] behind it if he says let there be light
[1:17:59] there will be light amen and it will be
[1:18:02] there because he's God Amen there's no
[1:18:04] way in which God can place his spirit
[1:18:06] inside you and he said I'm going to save
[1:18:08] you and I'm going to give you all your
[1:18:10] heart desires and then that does not
[1:18:12] come to pass no ways amen otherwise he's
[1:18:14] not God yeah there's no way if he says
[1:18:18] hey I will give you your heart's
[1:18:22] desire I'll give you a wife I'll give
[1:18:25] you a husband just know that he's coming
[1:18:27] and she's coming and because God said it
[1:18:30] that's
[1:18:31] right it's got so much
[1:18:34] power that can create he can create your
[1:18:37] wife or your husband and he will come
[1:18:40] because he said I'll give you a if he
[1:18:42] find that the whole up I don't have a
[1:18:44] husband he will make him to come right
[1:18:47] he'll cross the
[1:18:49] Seas he just find that he wants to go to
[1:18:51] New Zealand and he wants to go to Shak
[1:18:54] all right
[1:18:55] he doesn't know why meanwhile there's a
[1:18:58] girl or there's a
[1:19:01] boy God can do that amen so the only
[1:19:04] thing is for me and for you one to know
[1:19:09] it deep down in our heart to know it and
[1:19:12] to believe it and to obey it amen and
[1:19:16] then we just walk on the line no matter
[1:19:19] what the devil does because that man
[1:19:21] wanted to ridicule Jesus if we do that
[1:19:24] brother and sister we have invited him
[1:19:27] and we have welcomed
[1:19:28] him don't worry about the hardships up
[1:19:32] those things until Paul said brother
[1:19:35] Isaac oh death he he told death because
[1:19:39] you preach brother you said I mean who
[1:19:42] cares what the devil can do the the
[1:19:44] worst thing he can do is to kill this
[1:19:47] flesh and we are not afraid of
[1:19:50] dying we're not afraid of going of
[1:19:52] course we don't want to go we want to
[1:19:54] decide if it was possible when to go and
[1:19:56] when not to
[1:19:57] go but we've got all the
[1:20:01] power to say Lord 20 more years please
[1:20:06] I'm not going to I'm not going now
[1:20:08] because must be a spiritual it must be
[1:20:10] according to the spirit of the Lord Lord
[1:20:13] I'm not going Lord I want this house to
[1:20:16] be sold Mike and it must be sold for
[1:20:20] this price am I in this cleaning
[1:20:23] business sorry I'm just giving our
[1:20:25] practical
[1:20:26] examples I want so much this is the
[1:20:28] amount I want Lord because this money I
[1:20:30] want to use it for this this this this
[1:20:32] this include the Lord in there you we we
[1:20:36] must set our own
[1:20:38] salary and said I want this much I hear
[1:20:42] you you're paying all your people so
[1:20:44] much and I understand the circumstances
[1:20:46] of your company but let the Lord bless
[1:20:48] your company so that because I can I
[1:20:50] want so much this is what I want and I'm
[1:20:52] a daughter of God me for your
[1:20:54] information and you by the way you're
[1:20:57] going to be blessed in this company
[1:20:58] because you've got a daughter of God
[1:21:00] nothing about me but there's a daughter
[1:21:02] of God inside me me I'm going to make
[1:21:04] mistakes don't say ah daughter of God no
[1:21:06] no no no there's an inside
[1:21:10] me right so let's get to that point
[1:21:13] where we exercise his word as he said it
[1:21:18] not as a Pharisee who says master and
[1:21:22] and and and and so the i i issue that's
[1:21:24] what led me to say these things the i i
[1:21:27] issue let's get rid of it get out of the
[1:21:29] way where Jesus belongs in this thing
[1:21:32] I'll do I'll do I'll have no no let it
[1:21:36] be as the Lord will amen as the Lord
[1:21:40] will if the Lord is
[1:21:42] willing right yeah and you remove the
[1:21:45] eye you put him there so I'll I'll stop
[1:21:50] it here brothers and sisters what I want
[1:21:52] us to do is to use this opportunity that
[1:21:54] we
[1:21:56] have because the Pharisee lost
[1:22:01] it he suspected that this man is a
[1:22:03] prophet and he doubt he doubted yeah but
[1:22:08] it was a great opportunity for because
[1:22:10] that man agreed to come to his house
[1:22:11] amen he was supposed to give him top of
[1:22:14] the
[1:22:16] row he lost an
[1:22:19] opportunity until the Lord addressed him
[1:22:22] I can see when he started to make that
[1:22:23] wedding and just about him him and
[1:22:27] him selfish and then he the
[1:22:31] Lord told him he still did not get the
[1:22:36] Revelation so let's let let us change
[1:22:39] that seron and make it the welcom Christ
[1:22:42] in our lives amen and not only verbally
[1:22:45] we are going to be welcoming him on our
[1:22:48] day today lives in our thoughts in our
[1:22:52] actions in our Behavior knowing very
[1:22:54] well
[1:22:55] that our enemy is going around us like a
[1:22:57] roaring lion seeking to devour you
[1:23:00] knowing very well that no matter how
[1:23:02] hard it can be he who I love I rebuke
[1:23:05] and I chastise knowing very well that
[1:23:07] the cup of iniquity wants to taint you
[1:23:10] just to taint you a little bit so let
[1:23:13] certain things not even be heard Among
[1:23:17] Us let certain things let not the pastor
[1:23:19] come here and say I'm tired of people
[1:23:22] who are gossiping let's let's not get
[1:23:24] that's
[1:23:25] our food is supposed to be we when are
[1:23:28] we go we are going but the moment the
[1:23:30] Holy Spirit comes and rebuke us
[1:23:32] that like Paul says I've heard that
[1:23:35] among you there are some who are doing
[1:23:36] this you know Paul Paul spoke
[1:23:39] frankly so let let let us pass that
[1:23:42] bridge let's pass that road let that
[1:23:45] Spirit know where where it belongs
[1:23:47] that's right and let us move on into
[1:23:49] higher places in Christ Jesus so that's
[1:23:52] my encouragement that's my my my
[1:23:54] encouragement to you that we don't just
[1:23:59] come to
[1:24:00] church and have and be
[1:24:02] religious and just be good and support
[1:24:05] the community of this church no no no no
[1:24:07] no I rather I rather be
[1:24:11] home let's not just come to
[1:24:13] church let's come to church that's a
[1:24:16] good thing but let it be a secondary
[1:24:17] priority the first priority is that
[1:24:20] Jesus must find a
[1:24:22] welcomed in my heart in everything that
[1:24:26] I do in everything that I I I think
[1:24:28] about everything that I plan Lord are
[1:24:31] you approving
[1:24:32] this are you approving this in my life
[1:24:35] Lord Lord this is my
[1:24:38] Salary thank you how how can I use
[1:24:43] it
[1:24:45] Hallelujah so may the Lord bless you I I
[1:24:48] I pray
[1:24:49] that I've done more encouragement than
[1:24:54] then
[1:24:56] rebuke I I I'm not qualified to rebuke
[1:24:59] the Lord so if you just go and read the
[1:25:01] Bible you'll find him rebuking and
[1:25:03] encouraging you and loving you so me I'm
[1:25:05] just convey I'm just like this
[1:25:08] mic this mic and those speakers that's a
[1:25:11] conveyor
[1:25:12] belt so don't cut the conveyor belt so
[1:25:16] all I'm trying to say is that he loves
[1:25:18] you so much that he can take an
[1:25:21] unworthy sinner SA sa by Grace like
[1:25:25] myself to come and and remind you we are
[1:25:28] just reminding one another I'm being
[1:25:30] reminded myself that be careful of your
[1:25:34] thoughts be careful of your behavior be
[1:25:37] careful how you address your wife be
[1:25:39] careful how you address your brothers
[1:25:40] and sisters be careful of how you think
[1:25:42] about them be careful of what you say to
[1:25:44] other people about them and let us pass
[1:25:48] that
[1:25:48] stage into higher places amen and
[1:25:52] Rapture one of these days amen can you
[1:25:54] have you ever imagine how is it going to
[1:25:56] be when when we just above this roof and
[1:25:59] you realize that oh look you know the
[1:26:02] excitement is going to be funny it's
[1:26:03] going to be this body can't contain it
[1:26:06] it's going to be have you ever seen a
[1:26:08] happy little
[1:26:10] puppy have you ever seen it he doesn't
[1:26:12] know what to do it looks like the own
[1:26:15] where do you come from to give me such
[1:26:17] food so the excitement is going to be
[1:26:21] unimaginable that day you realize that

[1:26:48] where you'll go there in two seconds and
[1:26:49] come back quickly here and and that body
[1:26:52] is capable of doing that because it's
