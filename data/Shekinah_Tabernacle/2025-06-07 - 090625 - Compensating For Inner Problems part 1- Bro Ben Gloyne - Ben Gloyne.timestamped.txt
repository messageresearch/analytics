[5:01] God bless you this
[5:03] morning. Welcome to the house of God.
[5:05] How you feeling?
[5:06] Good,
[5:08] happy,
[5:11] saved. Your soul is
[5:14] eternal. Amen. Then we're good. It's all
[5:16] good. Praise the Lord. Let's um stand
[5:19] this morning. I already feel a nice
[5:22] atmosphere here and I believe um the
[5:23] Lord's going to bless us in a powerful
[5:25] way here this
[5:26] morning. We are coming to the solution
[5:30] this morning. Life gives us us a lot of
[5:34] problems. But you know as believers we
[5:36] can when we when we come to the Lord we
[5:38] come to the
[5:39] solution of everything. You know, like
[5:42] like like um Jonah when he was in the
[5:45] belly of the whale, he could have looked
[5:47] a lot of at a lot of different
[5:49] directions to towards his problem, but
[5:51] he chose to look to the solution. I'll
[5:54] look to thy holy till to thy temple. I
[5:57] I'll face where the the direction of
[5:58] you, Lord, where you are, and I'll look
[5:59] to you. And he looked to the solution.
[6:02] And not long after that, he got spat up
[6:04] on the beach.
[6:08] If you're in the belly of a whale this
[6:09] morning, if you just looked for the
[6:10] solution, eventually you'll get spat up
[6:12] on the
[6:14] beach and it will all fall into
[6:17] [Music]
[6:19] place. You know, God's ways are far
[6:21] above our ways. He He We sing a song, he
[6:24] makes a way where there is no way, you
[6:26] know. You know, like his ways are he's
[6:29] just got a way of working working
[6:32] complex things out and making them all
[6:33] simple. Amen. So, let's just pray this
[6:35] morning. Heavenly Father, we so grateful
[6:37] that we can look to you this morning,
[6:38] Lord, as the solution, Lord, that we as
[6:42] Lord, the the objective of our life,
[6:45] Lord, is just to look to you, Lord.
[6:47] There's many distractions in this world
[6:49] that we can look to other things. We can
[6:50] look here, look there, look all around.
[6:52] But Lord, we come here this morning to
[6:54] look to you, Lord Jesus. Where there's a
[6:56] song that says, "Look and live, my
[6:57] brother, live, my sister, live, Lord. We
[6:59] we look to you, Lord, and we believe
[7:01] you're the answer to all things. And we
[7:02] just want to look to you and live this
[7:03] morning, Lord. and just pray that you'd
[7:06] continue to shine your face upon us,
[7:08] Lord. That the light of your countenance
[7:09] would shine upon us this morning, Lord.
[7:11] Just bless us. Bless the songs, bless
[7:12] the ministry, bless the specials. We're
[7:14] under great expectation, Lord, to
[7:16] receive from you this morning, Lord. We
[7:18] believe you're already in our midst,
[7:19] Lord. And you're going to bless us in a
[7:21] powerful way. We're going to leave here
[7:22] refreshed, renewed, Lord, full of faith,
[7:24] encouraged, Lord, strengthened for the
[7:26] the journey ahead, Lord. So, we just
[7:28] want to commit the service to your
[7:29] hands, Lord, and just pray your
[7:30] continued blessing upon us in Jesus
[7:32] wonderful name. Amen. Praise the Lord.

[20:24] and a
[20:25] testimony. And we'll ask um Fish and his
[20:29] family to come up first.
[20:32] that that uh turn me on that um just
[20:35] where they're getting ready that the
[20:37] author of that song was a lady Fanny
[20:40] Crosby. She wrote a lot of different
[20:43] hymns and she was um blind.
[20:47] Yeah. So she wrote a song called I know
[20:49] him by the nail prints in his hand. But
[20:52] you know that song came because people
[20:53] were making fun of her that oh how you
[20:56] going to know what he looks like when
[20:57] you see him? You know you're blind. And
[20:59] she she her response was, "I'll know him
[21:01] by the nail prints in his hand." And she
[21:03] wrote a song with that same name.
[21:29] Brother Fish, you're really pulling
[21:31] ahead in the specials department.
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] Bring your
[22:11] tide. Bring your shame. name. Bring your
[22:16] guilt and bring your
[22:19] pain. Don't you
[22:21] know that's not your
[22:24] name? Oh, you always mean much more to
[22:31] me. And every day I wrestle with the
[22:35] voices that you tell me I'm not
[22:39] right. That's all right.
[22:44] And so I hear the voice and he calls me
[22:48] redeemed when others say I'll never be
[22:54] enough. And greater is the one living
[22:58] inside of me than he who's living in the
[23:05] world. In the
[23:11] world. In the
[23:13] [Music]
[23:17] world. And greater is the one living
[23:22] inside of me than he who is living in
[23:27] the
[23:29] world. Bring your
[23:32] doubts. Bring your tears.
[23:36] Bring your
[23:37] hurt and bring your
[23:40] tears. There'll be no
[23:44] conflation
[23:45] here. Oh, you holy righteous and
[23:52] redeemed. And every day I will there'll
[23:56] be those who will call me a
[24:01] mistake. But that's okay.
[24:05] Cuz I hear the voice and he calls me
[24:11] redeemed. When others say I'll never be
[24:17] enough. And greater is the one living
[24:21] inside of me than he who is living in
[24:26] the
[24:28] world. In the
[24:34] world. In the
[24:41] world. There'll be days I lose a battle.
[24:44] Grace says it doesn't matter cuz the
[24:48] cross already won. The war is greater.
[24:52] He's greater. I'm learning to run
[24:55] freely. Understand just how he sees me.
[24:58] And it makes me love him more and more.
[25:01] He's greater. He's greater.
[25:05] Cuz I hear the voice and he calls me
[25:11] redeemed. When others say I'll never be
[25:15] enough.
[25:17] And greater is the one living inside of
[25:22] me than he who is living in the
[25:28] world. In the
[25:29] [Music]
[25:34] world in the world.
[25:39] [Music]
