[45:57] the sinus cavity and different things
[45:59] like that so I've had a lot of trouble
[46:00] with that and it wasn't healing and I
[46:03] was in a lot of pain and this is um
[46:06] middle of March um may now so I had had
[46:08] a second operation like thing where they
[46:10] tried to fix this but it didn't wasn't
[46:13] successful so I was driving up to tango
[46:14] and I was a lot of pain I remember I was
[46:16] all black inside my mouth I was really
[46:17] sore and I was driving up to Tonga and I
[46:20] just was asking the Lord why because the
[46:22] devil started attack me like oh do you
[46:24] have faith now where is your Fai faith
[46:26] and I've seen the Lord do so many
[46:28] miracles in my life I've seen him I've
[46:30] had sister disappear when I was on the
[46:32] waiting list for operations I've had
[46:34] I've had grow fall off my face I've had
[46:36] so many miracles I know he's a Healer I
[46:38] know he's Mighty and I know that's not
[46:41] anything I doubt but I was like where is
[46:42] my faith and the Lord spoke to me
[46:45] driving up to Tonga that time so clearly
[46:47] he said this is a light Affliction just
[46:51] for a moment but with a far more
[46:52] exceeding weight and glory and when he
[46:54] spoke that to me it was
[46:56] I just shouted all the way to to I
[46:58] couldn't I was just rejoicing and it
[46:59] didn't matter whether I was in paying or
[47:01] whether I wasn't I knew I'd heard from
[47:04] the Lord and I knew that's what he said
[47:05] to me so I've held on to that ever since
[47:07] I've stopped worrying about it I'm just
[47:09] thankful to the Lord and then I saw the
[47:12] specialist um it was was also a miracle
[47:15] because it was so quick it was the same
[47:16] day that I rang up that when I was
[47:18] referred so normally it's months someone
[47:21] had canceled and I got to go in and they
[47:23] said that I've got two um large holes in
[47:25] the sinus which need to be repaired and
[47:27] I've got to sent to me to a bone missing
[47:28] which theyve got to fix
[47:31] so um I went home from that feeling like
[47:34] whoa now that is something I've been
[47:36] afraid of all my life is surgery so I'd
[47:39] had a very minor thing I thought oh well
[47:41] that's kind of like it but all you know
[47:42] it's not really that and I've always
[47:44] been had a great fear of being
[47:47] sedated it's because it's like out of
[47:49] controls so I've had this massive here
[47:52] and so I was went home from this and El
[47:54] Marie Rings me up and she says what's
[47:56] happened I've had you on my heart the
[47:58] whole day something to do with your
[47:59] mouth and I told nobody I think I might
[48:01] have told Chantel cuz she was there or
[48:02] something but I told nobody about it so
[48:04] the Lord had just put it on her heart so
[48:06] strongly and she um when she rang me she
[48:10] said I don't know why but the Lord has
[48:12] told me like I feel like I've got to
[48:14] tell you about my dad and I asked her if
[48:16] it's okay if I share this because it's
[48:18] quite personal but and she said that her
[48:21] dad had had a fear of being stabbed his
[48:24] whole life he just had this fear and
[48:27] that when he he was brutally murdered he
[48:31] was stabbed but she said that when he it
[48:35] took quite a long time before they
[48:36] killed him but he said to her mother who
[48:40] was lying there that he is no fear and
[48:42] that the Lord was with him and he knew
[48:44] that and she said he died a Victorious
[48:46] man because and so he had to go that way
[48:50] to overcome that fear and I felt the
[48:52] Lord speak to me so clearly whether it's
[48:54] the or Audible Voice I don't know but he
[48:56] said to me that's why you have to go
[48:58] through this so you know I'm with you
[49:00] even in a surgery something you fear and
[49:03] I am so excited cuz tomorrow is my
[49:06] surgery I'm so excited to know that the
[49:09] Lord's going to be with me and there's
[49:10] something Supernatural it's more
[49:12] Supernatural for me now than if he just
[49:14] healed me and I know it sounds funny to
[49:16] say because I've already experienced him
[49:18] as a Healer like that but I haven't
[49:19] experienced him as a comfort in this
[49:22] time like that before so I'm very
[49:24] excited to know that and um yeah looking
[49:26] forward to it and thank you for all your
[49:28] prayers especially for
[49:30] tomorrow

[52:55] um
[52:57] Hebrews I want to go to Hebrews um
[53:02] chapter N I believe it
[53:19] is so now we'll go from Hebrews
[53:22] 9 verse 11
[53:26] but
[53:27] Christ being come and high priest of
[53:30] good things to come by a greater and
[53:32] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[53:34] hands that is to say not of this
[53:37] building neither by the blood of goats
[53:38] and of carbs but by his own blood he
[53:41] entered and once into the holy Place
[53:43] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[53:45] us amen for if the blood of bulls and of
[53:47] goats and of Ashes of a he sprinkling
[53:50] the unclean sanctify to the purifying of
[53:52] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[53:54] of Christ Christ who through the eternal
[53:57] spirit offered himself without spot to
[53:59] God Pur your conscience from dead Works
[54:01] to serve the Living God am and for this
[54:04] cause he is the mediator of the New
[54:06] Testament that by means of death for the
[54:09] Redemption of the transgressions that
[54:11] were under the first testament they
[54:13] which are called might receive the
[54:16] promise of Eternal inheritance amen amen
[54:21] may the Lord bless his word you may you
[54:22] may have your
[54:24] seats and also I want to read another
[54:27] scripture from from John chapter
[54:34] 8 and Jesus speaking to the scribes and
[54:36] Pharisees in John 8 and
[54:41] verse3 it says as he spake these words
[54:43] many believed on him and we're going to
[54:45] read down to uh verse 36 then said Jesus
[54:50] to those Jews which believed on him if
[54:51] you continue in my word then are ye my
[54:54] disciples and indeed and you shall know
[54:56] the truth and the truth shall make you
[54:59] free they answered him we be Abraham's
[55:03] seed and were never in bondage to any
[55:04] man how saith thou we shall be made free
[55:08] Jesus answered them verely verely I say
[55:10] unto you whosoever committeth sin is the
[55:13] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[55:16] not in the house forever but the son
[55:19] abideth ever if the son therefore shall
[55:22] make you free ye shall be free indeed
[55:26] amen hallelujah now we read there in if
[55:30] you go read the book of Hebrews Paul you
[55:32] know the Apostle Paul is constantly
[55:35] contrasting between the blood of bulls
[55:37] and goats and the natural high priest
[55:39] they had the you know the aonic
[55:41] priesthood the sprinkling of you know of
[55:44] the blood of bulls and goats and he
[55:45] would contrast that with the blood of
[55:47] Jesus Christ and he says a few uh in a
[55:50] few places in the book of Hebrews that
[55:52] it's by one offering he did not you know
[55:55] the the high priest under the order of
[55:57] Aaron they had to go on once a year into
[56:00] the holiest place they had to offer
[56:01] their blood you had to offer the blood
[56:04] once a year you know but the blood of
[56:06] Jesus Christ was offered once amen it
[56:09] wasn't it doesn't have to be offered
[56:10] again our lord Jesus when he you know
[56:13] when he died that day on Calvary he paid
[56:16] the full price of redemption for every
[56:17] man woman and child you he died for the
[56:20] sins of the world so no one can say that
[56:22] Jesus has never done anything for them
[56:25] because he's already paid for our sin
[56:28] he's cleared our sin dead if we will
[56:29] receive it Hallelujah and he did it once
[56:32] so he didn't need to do it again he
[56:34] doesn't need to pay off any interest he
[56:36] doesn't need to do anything else it's
[56:38] already done hallelujah that's why he
[56:41] said the last few words he said is it is
[56:44] finished amen so now the reason the
[56:47] reason that he had to Die the way he did
[56:49] to purchase our Redemption is because he
[56:52] wanted man to be free amen and it's
[56:55] amazing when you know the scribes and
[56:57] Pharisees the very religious ones that
[56:59] Jesus even came to redeem they were
[57:03] rather in uh indignant that day where he
[57:05] said who you know we are Abraham's seed
[57:08] why should you know we have never been
[57:09] in bondage to any man but they had not
[57:12] realized that they were been in slavery
[57:15] because they were under slavery of a
[57:17] religion that could never free them they
[57:20] were under slavery to a religion that
[57:22] they could never climb above their
[57:25] fallen nature are you following me they
[57:27] were under a religion it was God
[57:29] ordained God told them to kill you bulls
[57:32] and goats and offer blood and have
[57:34] priests and do different things but it
[57:36] could never free them it only put them
[57:39] in prison because the law was only
[57:41] rarely given that man would know that
[57:44] they are in trouble that's right amen
[57:46] that man would know that they are under
[57:49] they are in prison I mean that's the
[57:51] only reason for the law it did not free
[57:53] anyone brother brandom said said that
[57:55] the law was just a policeman that put
[57:57] you in jail but the grace of Jesus
[57:59] Christ gets you out of jail Hallelujah
[58:03] so we can be really free this morning
[58:05] amen amen and I want to really pose the
[58:07] question to you are you free are you
[58:10] really free to worship the Living God
[58:12] Amen are you really free from your
[58:14] pasten are you really free from a guilty
[58:17] conscience that's right amen are you
[58:19] free from the things maybe you did
[58:20] yesterday right are you free of these
[58:23] things because realr Christianity is not
[58:25] to make you to reform you to make you a
[58:28] better person real Christianity is the
[58:30] life of God comes into you I mean
[58:32] changes your nature and your desire amen
[58:35] that you are not ens slavery to anything
[58:38] amen I am the most freest person today
[58:41] am mean I am not afraid of falling in
[58:43] sin I'm not afraid of falling into my
[58:45] old life I mean as I've said if I lived
[58:48] in a brewery I would be sober every day
[58:50] I live there Hallelujah because there's
[58:52] no desire in me for those things anymore
[58:55] I am free Hallelujah and the beautiful
[58:59] thing is I we don't deserve it we do not
[59:02] earn it I mean it is a free gift from
[59:05] God I mean Freedom real freedom to be a
[59:08] real person I mean a real son and
[59:10] daughter of God like you're meant to be
[59:12] is a free gift amen and it's nothing you
[59:14] can it's nothing you have earned that's
[59:17] right it's not on good behavior right
[59:19] hallelujah it's not because you're a
[59:20] good boy and girl you you you earn a new
[59:22] star on your on your wall thingy or you
[59:26] lose one cuz you're bad it's a free gift
[59:31] Hallelujah nothing wrong with rewards
[59:33] though and saying all that amen so
[59:38] now this is the question Jesus was
[59:40] asking them he say you are not free and
[59:44] they were not happy with his his his
[59:46] answer because he said You shall know
[59:48] the truth and they thought they knew the
[59:50] truth right they could have said to them
[59:52] what do you mean we shall shall know the
[59:54] truth we have the we have the word that
[59:57] God said through Moses and the prophets
[1:00:00] we know the truth but because it was
[1:00:02] under the blood of bulls and goats it
[1:00:04] could not make them free indeed amen
[1:00:07] they were still under a religious
[1:00:09] bondage they could never be free but
[1:00:12] Jesus came and he was actually the one
[1:00:14] who gave the law on Mount Si amen but he
[1:00:17] came to say the son if you know the
[1:00:19] truth the truth shall make you free it
[1:00:22] is not us that makes ourselves free the
[1:00:24] truth will make you free there is a law
[1:00:27] or a power behind the truth that it will
[1:00:29] make you free Hallelujah I'm so glad you
[1:00:32] know it will make you free Hallelujah
[1:00:35] now I believe it amen he says now if the
[1:00:38] sun therefore shall make you free you
[1:00:40] are free indeed amen right verse 36 so
[1:00:44] he's not saying you'll be partially free
[1:00:47] or free some of the time you'll be free
[1:00:49] indeed if you're free indeed there's
[1:00:51] nothing holding you back amen if you're
[1:00:54] free indeed there's no shackle binding
[1:00:56] you down you're free indeed you're
[1:00:58] totally loosed to do whatever you feel
[1:01:01] to do right Hallelujah so if we are
[1:01:04] called to run in this run in this day to
[1:01:07] run this race with patience there's no
[1:01:09] there should be no encumbrance there
[1:01:11] should be nothing holding us down amen
[1:01:13] you following me we can run amen amen so
[1:01:16] we have been called to run and we have
[1:01:18] been given the ability to do so y so I
[1:01:21] want to ask you the question now I've
[1:01:22] asked it already but I really want to
[1:01:24] just put this in are you really free you
[1:01:27] say well I'm a Christian I believe in
[1:01:29] the Lord Jesus that he died for me and
[1:01:31] he died on the cross fre but are you
[1:01:33] really free amen because it's it's the
[1:01:37] devil likes to hold our past against us
[1:01:40] I mean he likes to whip us with it you
[1:01:43] know he likes to you know every time
[1:01:45] that we have failed he likes to hold it
[1:01:47] against us amen when we try and rise up
[1:01:50] in faith and receive a promise he's
[1:01:52] always whispering in our ear but you do
[1:01:54] this and you did this wrong and look
[1:01:56] what's happened to your life and look
[1:01:57] what you've caused and all the damage
[1:01:59] you've done but you've got to you've got
[1:02:01] to make peace with the fact amen that if
[1:02:04] God has called you to Salvation which he
[1:02:06] has that's why you're present here today
[1:02:08] amen if there's something in your heart
[1:02:10] that wants him it's because God put it
[1:02:12] there and you've got to just put your
[1:02:14] past under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:16] amen because our success and going in a
[1:02:18] Rapture is not based on what we can do
[1:02:22] but in saying that we yield ourselves
[1:02:24] say Lord I want to live a life let every
[1:02:27] breath all that I have never cease to
[1:02:30] worship you it should be that way but
[1:02:33] we're not going to get there on our
[1:02:34] ability that's right amen amen but it is
[1:02:37] our response to what he has done for us
[1:02:39] that's why we serve him
[1:02:41] Hallelujah I want to read you the um the
[1:02:45] definition of Grace hallelujah
[1:02:50] hallelujah this is under this is in the
[1:02:52] New
[1:02:53] Testament I've said this before but I
[1:02:56] love it so Grace in the New Testament
[1:02:58] now the Greek it means
[1:03:00] graciousness as
[1:03:02] gratifying of manner or act especially
[1:03:06] the Divine influence upon the heart and
[1:03:09] Its Reflection In The Life That's Grace
[1:03:13] yeah when there's Divine influence upon
[1:03:15] your heart and it's reflected in your
[1:03:17] life yes amen that's why when I think
[1:03:20] it's in Zechariah when he sees the when
[1:03:22] he sees the um when he sees the temple
[1:03:26] of God he sees the whole body of the
[1:03:28] redeemed and he sees the Capstone come
[1:03:31] down it comes down with Grace Grace with
[1:03:33] shoutings unto it amen because that
[1:03:35] Capstone is Jesus Christ coming to cap
[1:03:38] every believer Hallelujah so when you
[1:03:40] really see who he is there should only
[1:03:42] be a cry Grace Grace amen because
[1:03:45] because Grace is magnified in this hour
[1:03:48] amen Grace has been magnified because
[1:03:51] the Greater Grace is the greater the
[1:03:52] influence upon the heart amen and the
[1:03:55] greater the influence upon the heart the
[1:03:57] greater it's reflected in the Life
[1:03:59] Hallelujah so now this is the hour we
[1:04:02] alive to keep us free Hallelujah because
[1:04:06] we must understand that just as the
[1:04:09] first church was birth and freedom amen
[1:04:12] they were not bound by religion anymore
[1:04:15] they were not bound by the law of Moses
[1:04:17] they were not bound by you dead worship
[1:04:20] you they were purged from dead worship
[1:04:22] and formalism but then the enemy tried
[1:04:24] to come in and he did you read it in
[1:04:26] Acts about 15:16 how people who are
[1:04:28] fully not converted they came in and
[1:04:30] they tried to say people have to become
[1:04:32] Jews before they become Christians so
[1:04:35] there was now Spirit coming in trying to
[1:04:37] bind the people back from what they were
[1:04:39] heed from Hallelujah when Jesus came he
[1:04:42] didn't want to just you know he wanted
[1:04:45] the people separated from those dead
[1:04:47] things that's why it stand there see you
[1:04:49] bunch of wied wols you know he he told
[1:04:52] the people exactly what the scribes and
[1:04:53] Pharisees had done with the word of God
[1:04:56] and he made no butts about it he told
[1:04:58] them exactly you Generation of Vipers
[1:05:00] snakes amen you are of your father the
[1:05:03] devil and his works you do what is the
[1:05:05] devil's works if he can't get you bound
[1:05:08] down in the world or get you bound down
[1:05:10] in religion that's his Works someone say
[1:05:13] amen amen that's why this world is full
[1:05:15] of religion and people are not free
[1:05:18] right Amen in their good intentions they
[1:05:20] try and serve God but they're bound
[1:05:22] because the devil gives them a lot
[1:05:24] based on
[1:05:25] scripture amen and so he he he told them
[1:05:29] exactly what they were because of the
[1:05:31] spirit that was working in them and so
[1:05:33] now he identified those things that when
[1:05:35] the church was birthed at Pentecost it
[1:05:37] would be free and then the biggest
[1:05:40] battle that the Apostle Paul and the
[1:05:42] Believers had in the very early stages
[1:05:45] of the church was fighting the
[1:05:47] Antichrist Spirit trying to bind the
[1:05:49] people again amen that's why Paul says
[1:05:52] he says he fought the Beast at Ephesus
[1:05:55] he wasn't in an arena fighting lions I
[1:05:58] mean he wasn't fighting four-legged
[1:05:59] beasts he was fighting he was fighting
[1:06:02] Antichrist spirits in people because the
[1:06:05] Beast if you read the word beast in the
[1:06:07] Bible is an untameable thing it will not
[1:06:10] be yoked it will not be led it will not
[1:06:12] yield itself that's right amen because
[1:06:15] that's what that's what the devil is
[1:06:17] he's untamable he will not be tamed
[1:06:19] that's right right amen so he says he
[1:06:21] fought the beast in Ephesus so he was
[1:06:23] contending that's why Jude said
[1:06:25] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:06:27] once delivered to the Saints and that
[1:06:30] faith is total freedom amen that faith
[1:06:32] is total Liberty amen that we do not
[1:06:35] need to bow down to any humanistic
[1:06:37] spirit amen we do not need to bow down
[1:06:40] to any laws of man amen but Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] is our God and he is the one that we
[1:06:46] worship amen hallelujah and we must
[1:06:49] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:06:51] we can in this hour Hallelujah huah we
[1:06:54] can be free we are I believe we are a
[1:06:56] free people amen but don't let the devil
[1:06:59] ever try and get you to bow down to
[1:07:00] something that doesn't belong to the
[1:07:02] Lord amen amen because if he cannot
[1:07:05] remember the devil he doesn't care you
[1:07:08] know how religious we may be but if we
[1:07:10] are just bound up by
[1:07:12] something amen he just wants to hold us
[1:07:14] back a little bit oh we're we're
[1:07:16] conservative who says we're conservative
[1:07:18] that's right in our worship who says we
[1:07:21] have to fit a certain mold that's right
[1:07:23] amen who says have to fit a certain mold
[1:07:25] based on our ethnicity amen of how we
[1:07:28] worship or you know how we praise God or
[1:07:30] you know who says he says we've got to
[1:07:33] fit some kind of man's idea of how
[1:07:35] things should be if it's contrary to the
[1:07:37] word of course we should never be that
[1:07:39] way but if it's pleasing unto the Lord
[1:07:41] we should definitely be as God has made
[1:07:43] us amen you take a you take a natural
[1:07:46] party you pass the wine around you know
[1:07:48] and eventually after a few drinks the
[1:07:50] very quiet ones will be shouting and
[1:07:52] jumping and they'll be like like
[1:07:54] everyone else amen hallelujah the loud
[1:07:56] Ones Will Be You Know The Quiet Ones
[1:07:58] will be the same as the loud ones
[1:08:00] because all inhibitions of God people
[1:08:02] don't really care about what other
[1:08:04] people think of them and it must be the
[1:08:06] same way with us we shouldn't care what
[1:08:08] other people think Amen brother B he saw
[1:08:11] a he saw a lady rejoicing and shouting
[1:08:13] in a service and he thought if I only
[1:08:15] had half the victory she had amen
[1:08:18] because remember there's always a dance
[1:08:19] there's always a worship Hallelujah when
[1:08:22] there's victory men you take the
[1:08:24] children of Israel hallelujah amen they
[1:08:27] they they they come out of bondage
[1:08:29] they're not slaves anymore they pass
[1:08:31] through the Red Sea and a few moments
[1:08:33] few hours before Moses says stand still
[1:08:36] see the salvation of God for these
[1:08:39] Egyptians you see you'll see them no
[1:08:40] more forever Hallelujah then they cross
[1:08:43] the Red Sea the enemy tries to follow
[1:08:45] them amen the Sea comes over their enemy
[1:08:48] they're all drowned Hallelujah Miriam
[1:08:51] takes a tambourine up they begin to
[1:08:54] dance and rejoice I mean there's a real
[1:08:56] worship there's a Pentecostal meeting
[1:08:58] going on because their enemy is dead
[1:09:02] Hallelujah that's just a natural enemy
[1:09:04] friends hallelujah amen but there was a
[1:09:07] worship they didn't say pray they didn't
[1:09:10] do some dead George and chant and walk
[1:09:12] on they were happy cuz their enemy Was
[1:09:15] Defeated am mean there was joy in the
[1:09:17] camp amen and we know the joy of the
[1:09:20] Lord is our strength you're following me
[1:09:23] but the thing is now if the enemy came
[1:09:25] along and said well well he couldn't
[1:09:27] because they were dead it was so real
[1:09:30] the devil couldn't come along and say oh
[1:09:31] the the Pharaoh's Army is going to come
[1:09:33] get you you're still a slave now they'd
[1:09:36] say look you see that guy floating there
[1:09:37] that guy floating there that guy there
[1:09:39] that horse that they dead amen amen they
[1:09:41] were drowned and it's like our past
[1:09:44] you've got to recognize your past is
[1:09:46] dead amen that God has destroyed your
[1:09:50] path thank you Lord hallelujah that's
[1:09:51] why it says in the book of Hebrews by
[1:09:53] one off offering amen he has perfected
[1:09:55] for every them that are Sanctified he
[1:09:57] doesn't need to offer his blood again he
[1:09:59] doesn't need to do it again amen amen
[1:10:02] and it's the same he's trying to break
[1:10:03] the cycle off the Hebrews that doesn't
[1:10:06] have you don't have to go from year to
[1:10:08] year meeting to meeting camp to Camp
[1:10:11] church service to church service but
[1:10:13] it's by one offering amen you following
[1:10:15] me they are perfected forever them that
[1:10:17] are Sanctified so he's trying to get
[1:10:19] them to see and it's the same thing with
[1:10:20] us forget your past amen amen if it's
[1:10:24] under the blood of Jesus Christ you know
[1:10:26] it's done you don't need to be beaten by
[1:10:28] it you don't need to beat yourself up
[1:10:30] about it it's under the blood amen
[1:10:33] you've got to put it under the blood
[1:10:35] amen don't let guilt hold you back cuz
[1:10:38] guilt is a lie Hallelujah God wants us
[1:10:41] to be free hallelujah how can we be free
[1:10:43] he see we think that it's God putting
[1:10:47] our guilt upon us no no amen that's what
[1:10:51] the devil tries to get you to think oh
[1:10:53] but you did this and look at what if you
[1:10:56] if you weren't this way this person
[1:10:57] wouldn't have ended up this way and you
[1:10:59] were like this your children wouldn't be
[1:11:01] like this and if you did
[1:11:02] this forget
[1:11:04] it stop this is not this is not I'm
[1:11:07] sorry this is not a Catholic religion of
[1:11:09] Perry yeah of of doing some good works
[1:11:12] to try and atone for what you've done we
[1:11:15] don't need to atone for anything he
[1:11:17] atoned hallelujah hallelujah he's our
[1:11:19] atonment Hallelujah you follow me he did
[1:11:21] it if he did it I don't need to do it
[1:11:24] right am mean why would I try why would
[1:11:27] I try and Purge myself am mean of my
[1:11:30] conscience just put it under his blood
[1:11:32] amen amen amen you think God doesn't
[1:11:35] understand amen you think he holds your
[1:11:38] the devil holds your past against you
[1:11:40] God doesn't hold your past against you
[1:11:41] amen that's right am mean if it's an
[1:11:43] unconditional Covenant between you and
[1:11:45] God he's not going to hold it against
[1:11:46] you amen
[1:11:49] hallelujah glory amen you've got to
[1:11:52] recognize I know my voice is not
[1:11:54] behaving but just just bear with
[1:11:58] me you got to recognize he's come to
[1:12:00] make you
[1:12:01] free amen amen don't let reasoning come
[1:12:04] in Hallelujah don't let reasoning come
[1:12:06] in you know you take the woman at the
[1:12:09] well she and it's one of my favorite
[1:12:12] parts of the scripture you know she
[1:12:15] because of her upbringing and her you
[1:12:17] know her past led her down that track so
[1:12:21] where once she was probably a good girl
[1:12:23] at home she was now stuck as an outcast
[1:12:26] in her Village that's right amen she
[1:12:29] could not find love even though she was
[1:12:30] looking for love because she was married
[1:12:33] five times and the one she man she was
[1:12:35] with wasn't her husband she could not
[1:12:37] find what she was looking for amen right
[1:12:39] she was stuck and it was her choices
[1:12:42] because of the pressure at home LED her
[1:12:44] down that way amen now did Jesus come
[1:12:47] and hold that against her no when he
[1:12:50] came he says I need to go by the way of
[1:12:52] Samaria in other words he could have
[1:12:54] said there's a woman Hallelujah she's in
[1:12:57] a state but she's one of mine Hallelujah
[1:13:01] and so she he said I must go this way
[1:13:04] amen so he planned the whole because he
[1:13:06] knew that she would be there at that
[1:13:07] time Hallelujah even though she was in
[1:13:10] no doubt her guilt would have held her
[1:13:12] she would have felt bad for the way her
[1:13:14] life had become right amen Why didn't it
[1:13:17] work out with the first guy I don't know
[1:13:19] why didn't it work out with the second
[1:13:20] guyy I don't know third guy fourth guy
[1:13:22] fifth guy sixth guy and here here She is
[1:13:26] hallelujah amen she could not stop but
[1:13:29] you must understand things things can
[1:13:31] happen in our past you know the Apostle
[1:13:33] Paul he speaks of and and I think I
[1:13:36] believe it's Hebrews chapter 12 we won't
[1:13:37] read it but he speaks about a root of
[1:13:39] bitterness he says do not let a root of
[1:13:42] bitterness come unless it defile you
[1:13:44] amen so what can happen and what does
[1:13:46] happen is bad things can happen to
[1:13:48] people and their whole life can be now a
[1:13:51] manifestation of that pain amen where
[1:13:54] where where they will choose to do
[1:13:55] things that they hate to do but they'll
[1:13:57] end up in places and dark places because
[1:13:59] of pain of what has happened to them
[1:14:01] maybe when they're a child amen right
[1:14:03] amen that's what happens and it is not
[1:14:06] their fault it is the devil that has
[1:14:09] done that to them amen but there comes a
[1:14:13] time where you can be free of those
[1:14:15] things Hallelujah where are person can
[1:14:18] go free when they can remember Jesus
[1:14:20] didn't just die to heal us physically
[1:14:22] right spiritually he came to heal us
[1:14:26] amen so wounds that's why he said let's
[1:14:28] go to let's go to Luke chapter
[1:14:35] 4 Luke 4
[1:14:38] and8
[1:14:42] Hallelujah now this is before because he
[1:14:46] comes out of the you know there's a
[1:14:48] Temptation he has you know Satan tempts
[1:14:51] him in the in the desert for 40 days or
[1:14:54] he's he's fasting 40 days he's temped
[1:14:56] the devil and then after that he returns
[1:14:58] to Galilee and this is his first
[1:15:00] announcement uh Luke 18 I mean Luke 4:18
[1:15:05] well Luke 17 uh 4:1 17 because it says
[1:15:07] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:15:09] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[1:15:11] had opened the book he found the place
[1:15:13] where it was written so he was looking
[1:15:15] for a
[1:15:16] scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:15:19] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:15:22] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:15:25] heal the brokenhearted amen this is his
[1:15:28] purpose this is why Jesus came amen am
[1:15:31] mean to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:15:34] Deliverance to the captives and
[1:15:36] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[1:15:39] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:15:42] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:15:44] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:15:46] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:15:48] the eyes of all of them that were in the
[1:15:50] synagogue were fasted on him and he
[1:15:52] began to say say unto them this day this
[1:15:55] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:15:58] Hallelujah so he was declaring this is
[1:16:01] what I'm about to do amen I'm going to
[1:16:04] heal the brokenhearted so people who
[1:16:07] have been brokenhearted can be healed
[1:16:09] amen amen to to preach the gospel to the
[1:16:14] to the poor that can be physically or
[1:16:16] poor in spirit he has sent me to heal
[1:16:18] the broken heart to preach Deliverance
[1:16:20] to the captives amen now when you go to
[1:16:23] his ministry he doesn't go straight to
[1:16:25] the jails and open all the jail doors
[1:16:28] that's right he's not talking about just
[1:16:30] physical captives he's talking about
[1:16:32] spiritual captives where people have
[1:16:35] become enslaved by the devil amen but he
[1:16:38] says that I have come to deliver the
[1:16:40] captives and the recovering of the sight
[1:16:42] to the blind amen hallelujah that can be
[1:16:45] spiritual blindness as well amen and to
[1:16:48] set at Liberty them that are Bru amen
[1:16:51] he's also talking about a spiritual
[1:16:54] bruise amen where people can have bad
[1:16:56] things happen to them and it can bruise
[1:16:59] their Spirits now and they're actually
[1:17:00] enslaved by that
[1:17:02] bruise amen just like the body if it's
[1:17:05] bruised it is hindered in its function
[1:17:07] the same thing can happen when bad
[1:17:09] things can happen to us amen it can
[1:17:12] bruise it can produce a complex and our
[1:17:15] whole life can be now motivated by the
[1:17:18] pain of that bruise amen but he said
[1:17:20] I've come to set them at Liberty amen if
[1:17:23] he said I've come to set them at Liberty
[1:17:25] he can set them at Liberty Hallelujah
[1:17:27] you take the man who was who was Legion
[1:17:30] you know he he had a thousand devils in
[1:17:32] him you know he you know in his life he
[1:17:35] was a normal person and then he opened a
[1:17:38] door to one spirit and maybe he was
[1:17:40] looking for Comfort or something you
[1:17:42] know bad things can happen to us and
[1:17:44] then we go and find comfort and
[1:17:46] something try and drown our pain and
[1:17:48] sorrow amen I've been there and then he
[1:17:51] opened the door for another Spirit to
[1:17:53] come in the next thing he knows he's
[1:17:54] naked living among the tombs as a you
[1:17:57] demon possessed right Hallelujah now
[1:18:01] here's a man you think legalistically
[1:18:03] people would think there's no way he's
[1:18:04] gone too far he hadn't gone too far
[1:18:07] Jesus says we need a cross to se
[1:18:10] Hallelujah he knew that man was there
[1:18:12] amen so he couldn't save himself amen
[1:18:16] but then the son of man himself
[1:18:18] came Hallelujah then after a brief
[1:18:21] meeting he was that save man he wasn't
[1:18:25] that same man thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:18:27] he has found cloth and in his right
[1:18:29] mind amen now he could either be beaten
[1:18:33] down by his guilt or he could Rejoice
[1:18:37] I'm not that person anymore I've been
[1:18:39] free amen amen
[1:18:41] hallelujah amen amen so this is why the
[1:18:44] Lord came to set people free now the
[1:18:48] woman at the well she was
[1:18:50] bound amen she was bound there her life
[1:18:54] her past had bound her in such a way
[1:18:56] that this was now her l in life and
[1:18:59] humanly speaking without God ever coming
[1:19:02] upon her path that was her that's right
[1:19:05] that was her she was stuck and no doubt
[1:19:08] she would think how did Life come to
[1:19:09] this
[1:19:10] spot amen and many times we think how do
[1:19:14] we get into dark places like this but
[1:19:17] the reason we can get into Dark Places
[1:19:19] is because God wants to Deliver Us from
[1:19:22] those dark places amen hallelujah so now
[1:19:26] here comes the Lord and he doesn't
[1:19:28] condemn her for her past right amen he
[1:19:31] doesn't condemn her but there's
[1:19:33] something in her it says we know when
[1:19:35] Messiah cometh amen he'll tell us all
[1:19:38] things Hallelujah and in that moment she
[1:19:41] didn't have that problem amen she wasn't
[1:19:44] the woman at the well like she thought
[1:19:46] she was you know the problem is people
[1:19:48] get used to the condition they're in
[1:19:50] don't they we get used to it doesn't
[1:19:52] matter if it's wonderful F or terrible
[1:19:53] we become creatures of habit and we
[1:19:56] begin to actually worship our pain and
[1:19:58] worship our bad situations because we're
[1:20:01] used to them amen that's true it's Human
[1:20:05] Condition whatever state we're in we get
[1:20:06] used to that state amen and we just
[1:20:09] begin to well this is me and poor old me
[1:20:11] and wo is me and sure bad things happen
[1:20:14] and they're terrible you many 100% of
[1:20:16] the time but it's what do you want to
[1:20:18] own that thing that's right do you want
[1:20:21] to own that thing or do you want to be
[1:20:22] free
[1:20:24] amen cuz there's the two choices you can
[1:20:26] be free or you can remain bound amen
[1:20:29] hallelujah and it's nothing based on
[1:20:31] what you think you are in terms of are
[1:20:34] you worthy we're all unworthy we're just
[1:20:37] you just got to go beyond that come to
[1:20:39] that conclusion Lord I'm unworthy but
[1:20:41] yet I come Lord I don't deserve it but
[1:20:43] you've offered me full full Redemption
[1:20:47] amen Lord I could never earn this I
[1:20:48] don't want to try he doesn't want you to
[1:20:50] try that's right hallelujah
[1:20:54] amen amen doesn't matter what we think
[1:20:57] we are that's the problem humans humans
[1:21:00] put like to put things on scales because
[1:21:02] we're creatures of time and when it
[1:21:04] comes to comes to good and bad we always
[1:21:07] put good and bad on scales well this is
[1:21:10] not so bad this is really
[1:21:12] bad amen like a pickpocket that's not so
[1:21:16] bad compared to a murderer that's really
[1:21:17] bad amen but it's all the manifestation
[1:21:20] of sin it's all the attributes of
[1:21:23] so with God he doesn't put things on
[1:21:25] scales it's either black or it's white
[1:21:27] amen amen and he's not looking at well
[1:21:30] have you been a good boy or girl to
[1:21:32] deserve my my
[1:21:34] salvation even if you've turned it down
[1:21:37] God will come back around again amen
[1:21:39] amen hallelujah amen amen and so now he
[1:21:44] we put things on scales God doesn't put
[1:21:46] things on scales yes it's will you
[1:21:48] receive it or will you not receive it
[1:21:51] I'm so glad it's that that way amen it's
[1:21:54] not a seven seven Monon course to
[1:21:56] becoming a Christian it's not that way
[1:21:58] at all it's not a seven Monon course of
[1:22:00] how to clear your conscience it's not
[1:22:02] that way at all just put it all under
[1:22:03] the blood amen hallelujah I've done some
[1:22:06] horrific things well Moses killed a guy
[1:22:10] amen King David premeditated murder
[1:22:13] killed Uriah amen took bash Sheba
[1:22:15] committed adultery you know the story
[1:22:18] amen all these things are in the Bible
[1:22:19] for a reason amen the that Rahab was the
[1:22:24] only one who received the spies in
[1:22:26] Jericho he was a person come on friends
[1:22:29] go who's with me today he you with me
[1:22:31] it's the reason these people are put it
[1:22:33] wasn't the pious holy man in Jericho
[1:22:37] we've been waiting for you I'm holy now
[1:22:40] I'm going to receive salvation cuz I'm
[1:22:42] holy no it wasn't that kind of person
[1:22:45] they had their temples they had their
[1:22:47] religion they would have been calling
[1:22:48] upon their gods but here was a woman in
[1:22:50] in this kind of state and brother said
[1:22:52] it was cuz her parents put her out of
[1:22:55] the house amen because of the parent
[1:22:57] delinquency she ended up that way that's
[1:23:00] incredible because when when salvation
[1:23:02] comes to her house says I want a I want
[1:23:05] a sure token give me a sure token that
[1:23:08] me yeah I'll be safe and the spies say
[1:23:12] you just take the Scarlet thread take
[1:23:14] this rope that you're going to let us
[1:23:15] out of the out of the city by put it on
[1:23:17] your window th and thy house will be
[1:23:20] saved hallelujah hallelujah so the same
[1:23:23] parents that caused this to happen to
[1:23:24] her she brought them in hallelujah
[1:23:27] hallelujah think about it I mean so here
[1:23:29] she is in her State amen and salvation
[1:23:32] comes to her house and everyone who came
[1:23:34] under that token was safe in the time of
[1:23:37] Destruction and there's a reason that is
[1:23:39] put there in the Bible is because God is
[1:23:41] wanting you to know it doesn't matter
[1:23:43] what state you are in I mean we see
[1:23:45] destruction coming upon the Earth
[1:23:48] Hallelujah but just receive we've heard
[1:23:50] that we've heard what God has done amen
[1:23:52] and then we see he's risen out of
[1:23:53] History he's not a god of History
[1:23:55] anymore he's reality we're living in
[1:23:58] this we are living in this Bible
[1:24:01] Hallelujah give me mercy Hallelujah
[1:24:03] that's what she said give me mercy
[1:24:05] hallelujah hallelujah she received what
[1:24:06] she wanted amen that's why she's put
[1:24:09] there her past isn't so wonderful
[1:24:11] humanly
[1:24:13] speaking she was a she was a harlot but
[1:24:15] God wasn't looking at her har tree God
[1:24:17] is looking at will you take will you
[1:24:19] receive my promise hallelujah thank you
[1:24:22] Lord
[1:24:23] amen and all those stories are down
[1:24:25] through that's a reason brother Braham
[1:24:28] says that the Jews if it was if this was
[1:24:30] just just human humans writing a story
[1:24:34] why would such a proud Nation like the
[1:24:36] Jews put all that shame in those dark
[1:24:38] things about their about their heroes in
[1:24:40] the Bible and the but he's saying it's
[1:24:44] not a human book God inspired the people
[1:24:47] to write it that's right amen imagine
[1:24:50] Moses now cuz he wrote the first five
[1:24:51] books of the Bible
[1:24:53] and he's inspired to write Exodus or
[1:24:55] wherever it was that he murdered the uh
[1:24:57] you know slave uh slave master that's
[1:25:00] right no doubt he would have said I
[1:25:01] don't want to write that about myself
[1:25:03] tell them you've got a temper Moses I
[1:25:05] don't want to write that about myself
[1:25:07] but because he was a prisoner to the
[1:25:08] spirit of God he wrote down exactly what
[1:25:11] God told him to write Hallelujah no
[1:25:13] doubt King David I don't know if they
[1:25:15] would have gone over the Chronicles and
[1:25:16] read the read The Chronicles of the
[1:25:19] Kingdom but then the scribers whoever
[1:25:21] wrote it inspired to write about basima
[1:25:24] no doubt in this Humanity don't write
[1:25:26] don't write that down right Hallelujah
[1:25:29] I'm great King David don't write that
[1:25:32] down but God inspired them to write
[1:25:34] those things down amen you take you know
[1:25:37] there's all kinds of stories like that
[1:25:39] you know Abraham surely you no doubt if
[1:25:42] he could look over Moses's shoulder when
[1:25:44] Moses is writing the Book of Genesis no
[1:25:46] doubt maybe Abraham would have said to
[1:25:48] Moses don't write down where I backslid
[1:25:51] and went down into G here yeah amen
[1:25:54] that's right don't write it down right
[1:25:56] told Sarah you're my sister don't say
[1:25:58] we're married because they'll kill me to
[1:25:59] get you amen don't don't write it down
[1:26:03] basically I threw you under the bus to
[1:26:04] preserve me twice don't write it down
[1:26:08] amen he wouldn't have wanted that
[1:26:10] written down he with me Hallelujah but
[1:26:13] God inspired them amen but then when
[1:26:16] when when it comes into the New
[1:26:18] Testament amen through the blood of
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ now Paul is inspired to
[1:26:22] write about their lives Hallelujah and
[1:26:25] he would pick up his pick up his pen and
[1:26:27] when he would write the epistle to the
[1:26:28] Romans he'd say by faith Abraham
[1:26:31] staggered not at the promise of God but
[1:26:33] was strong giving praise fully persuaded
[1:26:36] that he' do that which is promise he
[1:26:38] staggers not hallelujah it's because
[1:26:41] through the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:43] when God is writing the commentary of
[1:26:45] their life he doesn't see their failure
[1:26:47] I mean he doesn't see the he doesn't see
[1:26:48] the humanity all he sees is the faith
[1:26:51] they had in the promise amen
[1:26:53] hallelujah it's the same thing with us
[1:26:57] we're all we we are we are people like
[1:26:58] their people we have pressures like they
[1:27:01] had pressures amen we have the same gray
[1:27:04] matter they do you with me we have the
[1:27:07] same human Spirit they did amen so there
[1:27:10] sure there's things in our lives we're
[1:27:12] not we're not too pleased about but
[1:27:16] you've got to come to a
[1:27:18] conclusion yes amen if God has saved me
[1:27:22] who's saved amen who's committed their
[1:27:24] life if he has saved you amen if he has
[1:27:28] saved you he saw what you have done are
[1:27:32] you following me he saw what you did he
[1:27:35] did not stop the woman at the well
[1:27:37] remember I just want to hit I just want
[1:27:38] to hit this real good if it's based on
[1:27:41] what our the the goodness of our past
[1:27:45] then why did he allow the woman at the
[1:27:46] well to become the woman at the well
[1:27:49] amen why did he allow Moses to kill kill
[1:27:52] a guy why did he allow David to do
[1:27:55] premeditate murder commit adultery
[1:27:57] that's right why did he allow all these
[1:27:59] things amen but it's because it's not
[1:28:02] based it's not based on your past amen
[1:28:05] and your and your ability it's purely
[1:28:08] based on God's salvation and God's
[1:28:11] election and it doesn't matter what
[1:28:13] state we find ourselves in Hallelujah
[1:28:15] that's why the woman at the well is so
[1:28:18] so precious is because it didn't matter
[1:28:20] what she the state Jesus found

[1:34:30] there that never saw Egypt they were
[1:34:32] never slaves but yet they had to be
[1:34:35] circumcised again there had to be a
[1:34:37] reality that the reproach of their
[1:34:39] forebears had been done away amen and it
[1:34:43] must be the same with you and I that we
[1:34:45] can't hold on to the bad skeletons in
[1:34:48] the closet that happen in our parents'

[1:35:20] sincere if you got saying right with

[1:35:42] comes along with our past and we say
[1:35:44] Lord forgive me that I did that and here
[1:35:46] he is saying what huh what are you
[1:35:49] talking about let's look at my record
[1:35:51] praise God there's only a blank page
[1:35:54] next well I don't have a
[1:35:56] yeah this is your record of life this is
[1:35:58] a Saint's record of life and we we stand
[1:36:02] there say Lord forgive me I did this and
[1:36:04] did this and did this and he looks and
[1:36:05] says I'm
[1:36:08] sorry it's not what are you talking
[1:36:11] about I don't forget yes amen he forgets
[1:36:14] your sins it goes to the Sea of his
[1:36:16] forgetfulness you're following me so if
[1:36:18] it was really a real thing a real it's
[1:36:21] what brother Bram says you're not
[1:36:23] forgiven you're Justified as if you
[1:36:26] never did it in the first place that's
[1:36:29] what real so we're not just forgiven
[1:36:32] it's we are justified by faith
[1:36:34] hallelujah hallelujah so we never did it
[1:36:37] in the first place amen that's why he
[1:36:40] takes up the record says well okay what
[1:36:42] day did you do it September 18th
[1:36:45] 2015 what time about 5: in the afternoon
[1:36:48] it's not
[1:36:49] there but I remember it no it's not
[1:36:52] there are you sure I'm sure he's sure of
[1:36:55] all things amen so if it's not on his
[1:36:58] record why are you worrying about it
[1:37:01] amen amen if it's not on his record why
[1:37:03] do you hold on to the guilt of it that's
[1:37:05] right it's the devil trying to hold
[1:37:08] things against you that's right yeah
[1:37:11] true hallelujah how you free yes I
[1:37:17] am thank you because we have to
[1:37:21] understand
[1:37:23] Peter
[1:37:24] says in Acts chap 10 to Cornelius he
[1:37:27] says God is not a respector of
[1:37:31] persons right so he's not partial one to
[1:37:36] another he is not a respector of persons
[1:37:39] all he have to do is come God's provided
[1:37:42] way amen amen so he's not a so he
[1:37:45] doesn't so if he was a respector of
[1:37:47] persons he could hold your past against
[1:37:50] you yes
[1:37:54] now if you want to read that that's in
[1:37:55] Acts
[1:37:56] 10:34 and Peter opened his mouth and
[1:37:58] said of a truth I perceive that God is
[1:38:01] no respector of persons but in every
[1:38:04] nation that that Feth him and worketh
[1:38:06] righteousness is accepted with
[1:38:09] him so he's not a respector of persons
[1:38:12] you come his provided way then he'll
[1:38:14] accept
[1:38:15] you
[1:38:17] amen but
[1:38:20] now we are called I'm just going to try
[1:38:23] and wind this up but in this day we are
[1:38:26] called to be free amen amen this day is
[1:38:30] the day of the restitution of all things
[1:38:32] restoration of all things so Adam and
[1:38:34] Eve they were not bound by anything
[1:38:36] before sin came in were they no they
[1:38:39] were free they were free people now God
[1:38:43] wants to prove his victory of Calvary to
[1:38:46] take a people still living in the sinful
[1:38:48] world Amen but make them free
[1:38:52] Hallelujah that the law of the spirit is
[1:38:55] in a people in such a way that their
[1:38:57] past doesn't hold them down their flesh
[1:38:59] doesn't hold them down their memory
[1:39:01] doesn't hold them down but they are free
[1:39:03] to worship
[1:39:04] God hallelujah this is the time of
[1:39:07] restorate it's like the slaves in in in
[1:39:09] America when the emancipation of
[1:39:11] Proclamation was proclamation of
[1:39:13] emancipation was written that's the bill
[1:39:15] to free all the slaves and on a certain
[1:39:18] day certain hour they were free when the
[1:39:21] came up they free on a certain day amen
[1:39:23] hallelujah so here they were one moment
[1:39:25] they were slaves but then when the sun
[1:39:28] came up amen amen as soon as the light
[1:39:32] hit them they were
[1:39:33] free Hallelujah and it is the same thing
[1:39:36] today amen that the gospel light is
[1:39:39] shining amen because it was because in
[1:39:42] those days like bit of a drama just say
[1:39:44] they're all in the valley the youngest
[1:39:45] ones could climb up to the top of the
[1:39:47] mountain to see the sun rising but the
[1:39:50] old ones couldn't climb up there so when
[1:39:52] the young ones went up there and the
[1:39:54] light struck them but it was still dark
[1:39:55] in the valley they could look back down
[1:39:58] and call and say we're free because the
[1:40:00] sun's up and it's the same thing today
[1:40:03] we've had a prophet climb up the
[1:40:04] mountain amen and he called down saying
[1:40:07] we are free amen we're free from
[1:40:09] denomination we're free from our path
[1:40:12] the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from
[1:40:13] all sin Hallelujah there's nothing
[1:40:15] holding us here anymore and he calls it
[1:40:18] down and we hear the word but then it
[1:40:19] takes while for the sun to come up and
[1:40:21] when the sun strikes Us in the valley
[1:40:23] that's when it becomes more of a reality
[1:40:26] Hallelujah I know so it's up to you now

[1:43:36] screams out you won't commit suicide
[1:43:38] soldier boy that's the devil talking to
[1:43:40] you deny him and be a real gentleman
[1:43:43] amen he just goes back to singing again
[1:43:45] and everyone's looking around saying who
[1:43:47] is that for cuz there's no one in
[1:43:48] uniform everyone's in a in a suit or
[1:43:50] whatever
[1:43:51] and then now he didn't he didn't receive
[1:43:53] his freedom
[1:43:54] then few days after that on the road
[1:43:58] Alaskan Highway the middle of nowhere
[1:44:00] hundreds of miles from anything there's
