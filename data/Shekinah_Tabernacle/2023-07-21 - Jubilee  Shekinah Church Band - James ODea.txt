Verse 1:
Years and years I laboured
Toil and tears were my meat
Since my debtors took me prisoner
Sold me to slavery
But every day that I toiled
The Jubilee was drawing closer
The forty ninth year was the longest year
Then I heard the trumpet sound

Chorus:
And when I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
I walked free
I walked free
When I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
And I ain't going back to slavery
Because Jesus has set me free

Verse 2:
Years I spent in confusion
I had eyes but couldn't see
The enemy had me stumbling in darkness
Spiritual slavery
But then I heard the prophet speaking

I heard the voice behind the voice
He opened up the Word and let the light shine in
Said you can all go free

Chorus:
And when I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
I walked free
I walked free
When I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
And I ain't going back to slavery
Because Jesus has set me free
(Chorus x2)

Bridge:
Jesus has set me free
Jesus has set me free
And he whom the son sets free
He is free indeed
(Bridge x2)

Chorus:
And when I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
I walked free
I walked free
When I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
And I ain't going back to slavery
Because Jesus has set me free
