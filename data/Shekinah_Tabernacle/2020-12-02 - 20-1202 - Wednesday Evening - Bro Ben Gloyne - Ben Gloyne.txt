use this um let's just stand shall we uh tonight let's have a just a um small thought before we go on prayer together um if you want to if you got your Bibles handy let's go to John 16 and we're going to read one uh portion of scripture from from John 16 I'm going to read from verse 7 I mean I trust everyone's had a good week so far amen this is Jesus speaking to his disciples and he he says this here he says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not see speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer tonight Lord Jesus we want to thank you for your word Lord we can truly sing Lord as we have just sung there's none like you Lord we just want to praise your Holy Name Lord we want to thank you we can gather tonight Lord we can gather in the middle of the week and let the pressure off in your presence and I just ask dear God may you just come and take the service Lord uh under your control take it over oh God take us over too Lord we just want to surrender our whole beings Lord into your hands Lord Jesus May Lord may it not be us praying but may it be you praying through US Lord Jesus may you just take the anoint speaker and hearer as well Lord Jesus just pray there be such an atmosphere in this place of prayer and intercession Lord and so Lord may you grant It For Your Glory we also want to remember those who can be here tonight Lord may you be their portion Lord if they watching by the way of the stream Lord I pray that they feel your presence and Lord may just be very real to them as well Lord those sick and body we want to thank you that we can claim those blood stains Lord Jesus claim your blood stains CU by your stripes Lord they were healed so thank you Lord for not just saving us that down Calvary but for healing us as well completely so we thank you for that dear God I just pray you bless each one here dear God we just want to give the service over to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you friends you may you may have your seats um tonight so I want to speak about where um I've been listening um a bit this week to to the message brother Baron preached which uh called a guide I've really been enjoying it and so I want to I want to speak about um um I just want to speak about a guide because when we read we you we read here in in in John that you know the Lord is saying that you know if he if he goes away he's going to send the spirit of Truth and that Spirit of Truth which is we know him in a different form as the Holy Ghost it's going to come it's going to show you things that are going to come in the future but it's going to lead you and guide you into all truth so there's going to be a you know when the Lord comes to us personally he's going to lead us and guide us into all truth there's actually going to be a guide that's going to come into our life that's going to guide us into certain things now we know that uh we everyone is Guided by something we are we are not our own guide but everyone needs a guide and everyone has a guide whether we are conscious of it or not there is a spirit leading us somewhere and and where that spirit is leading us is really what the life in US is manifesting right now yeah so that that Spirit can be of the world and it will manifest the world it can be a religious spirit it will just manifest religion or it will be the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ which will manifest his word in our lives now we need to be very careful that we know who's who's who's guiding us yes and um you know brother Braham he says that a guide um he says that you know we are being Guided by something he says he says here Moses was hurting his father-in-law's sheep jethra on the back side of the desert and one day an angel appeared to him in a burning bush now an angel came down to bring the message to Moses and otherwise and otherwise was to be his guide now men see we can't guide yourself there's two ways that's your way and God's way and when you're in your way you're out of God's way and and you have to forget your own way to find God's way a man cannot lead himself so it's very important that we that that the god of Our Lives is the Lord Jesus Christ amen now our guide is a very important uh person to have along with us you know if we are going into into uh uncertain territory we need someone to go with us you know that that knows the way now Joshua if we if we just turn there quickly as well we can go to Joshua um chapter chapter 3 and and Joshua makes an astounding statement here and uh when when they're about to cross over the river Jordan they're about to uh go into the Promised Land and he gives instruction to the people of Israel to follow the ark um and and he makes a statement Joshua 3 and verses 3 and 4 he says yet there shall be a space between you and it so so you and the Ark about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way here to for so so Joshua is telling the people keep a bit of a distance you can see where it is and you've got to follow it because now you're going into a You' never been this way you know they had been around Mount horb or in the desert for 40 years they knew what it was like to go around in circles but now they're going to go take the land and so the guide which is the word was going to take them places they never been before now I'll say this that Humanity hasn't been this way that we're living right now in terms of you know even the prophet when he when when he said I predict I do not prophesy that you know it'll end up finished in 1977 it ought to usher in the Millennium you know there'll be a termination of the world systems and it will ought to ought to um Usher in the Millennium you know we know that the World Systems church is a world system brother Braham says those things have come to an end and we know ushering is a period of time who's ever been ushered into a seat in a restaurant you come to the front door someone com says I'm going to take you to your seat there's a period of time between where you're standing by the front door and sitting in your seat so now we're in a time where the Millennium is being ushered in right right so so this is the world has never had a millennium I mean Adam and Eve you know we know in the garden sure but you know they didn't live out a thousand years but now humanity is about to step back into it so man has never lived in this kind of period of time true so we've never been this way before right right we've never lived in this kind of darkness before so we've got to have a guide through the darkness amen who's ever been lost before in a you know in the bush somewhere it it gets very it gets very you know you start to get a bit worried when you when you lose your bearings and you don't know which way is out you get it troubles you and then and then if you're not careful you start to do some crazy stuff because you realize you've lost you know you lost brother Bram would say in the message of guide you know have you ever seen a man that was lost did anyone ever have the experience of bringing in a man lost he says it's the most pitiful thing you ever seen when a man gets lost he goes wild he doesn't know what he's doing caught a man out there a boy and he had been lost in the woods and he thought he was a Rancher but he was in the wrong territory and he got lost so being a Rancher he thought he was a man of the outdoors but he was in a different so he's in a wrong territory so he was in a place that he' never been before and he got lost and he and and and turned around and when they found him 3 days later he was running like a wild man screaming at the top of his voice his lips was all eat up he throwed his gun away he didn't know what to do and when his own brother when they had to catch him and tie him when his own brother came to him he fed him like an animal tried to bite him he didn't know where he was at why he was lost and when a man's lost he he's in a state of bewildered now now he's talking about a natural loss what about a spiritual loss you know someone who doesn't know where they've come from where they're going where their life is going they they act like a wild man they don't know who they are don't know where they're going don't know you know anything they just start to act crazy like an animal and he didn't know and he didn't know that he's in that state he didn't realize he was acting like that that way because his being L sends this fever upon him and he don't know where he's at and how's he and and and how he's acting and so it is when a man's lost from God he'll do things that or he ordinary wouldn't do he'll do things that's beyond the thoughts of a human being a lost man from God a lost Church from God a church that's got away from God got away from the principles of God's Bible will do things that sometimes you wouldn't expect to find in a Church of the Living God they'll get their money by Bunko games playing Lottery gambling anything that they can do they'll teach anything they'll let anything get by Pat men on the back who big payers in the church and so forth like that to let them get and and and let them get by with it that's right put deacons on the board that's been married four or five times just in order to get by with it to make ends meet there's only one end that you've got to meet that's your oblig to God stand and tell the truth lost lost men in a bewildered State he's a Madman so we don't ever want to get in that kind of state we want to have a guide now in order to you know if I'm going to go out into the bush I'm not going to take just an amateur weekend guide I'm going to take a professional I want to take the best guide I could find cuz I don't want to get lost I don't want to get killed I don't to get stuck out there with no food no bearings No you know you know no shelter nothing I want the very best amen because we need the right kind of guide now now keep the holy spirit in mind when I when I give this list so a guide must know where he's going right a guide must know where he's going just like Joshua said you know we've been round the mountain basically 40 years now we're going to a place you've never been before follow the word so we don't want to be stuck in just going round in circles we have Easter then we have Easter again we just go around Church camp camp camp and you know just going around in circles one you know one year to the next in the same way no we need a holy spirit guide the holy spirit guide so so he must know where he's going and the Lord knows exactly where he's going amen and then but then also a guide he must know where he's going but he must know how to get there right there's no point in having an end destination of mind when you don't know how to get there the Lord knows how to get us there amen amen the Lord yes sir a guide must know the terrain that they're going to travel over he must know the terrain what good is a GU who knows the flat Flats but we're going up into the hills he'll get lost he needs to know the hills if we're going into the Hills right so a guide must know the terrain now our lord Jesus knows the terrain he knows the age we live in he knows the type of society we're in he knows the world economics he knows the state of religion he knows the state of man he knows the state of what the devil's doing he knows the terrain amen amen amen a guide must know the weather patterns especially in this kind of country you can be here at Sunny go up the hills next minute you know wind comes through there's a blizzard whatever more you know you've got to know the weather patterns if you can't read the weather you I'm not talking about oh we know what me surfice is doing but if you can't read the weather in the sky how are you going to predict okay now it's going to start raining we better get down to safety or this is going to happen the wind's going to change you know our Lord knows the weather patterns real well you know there the cold breeze trying to blow through the church formalism trying to blow through the kind of protective you got to put on to to to withstand those kind of winds Hallelujah you know he knows the way you're the kind of head gear you got to wear you know all those you know protect from the acid of gossip and you know you know cold Winds of formalism and you know he knows he knows and he and he say and a guide must know the potential dangers that are out there see what good now if I take a guide who knows the bush here and take them into Africa we'll be we'll be Lion's lunch Hallelujah you know because he's never he's never had experience with those kind of animals right you got to have the right kind of guide for the right kind of place amen but our lord Jesus he's had experience with the devil he knows his tricks he knows his tactics he knows you know how he tries to catch praying different things amen so you got to have the right kind of guide that's right amen that knows the potential dangers that's why but you got to know those things but in but but in order to you can have the most perfect guide that there's ever been but if you do not have confidence in that guide if you don't listen to that guide if you don't pay attention to that guide then it's not going to do you any good you've got to you've got to you've got to have trust and confidence in your guide and you've got to have confidence remember it's not when the weather's fine and everything's just just going fine out in the bush that you need to listen to your guide It's really you know it's when it's when a crisis strikes that's really when a person's character comes out right so when crisis strikes the church you see the character of God expressed I mean when you see hardship come in and he counters that hardship he brings forth you know his word to to to bring a stability and bring a healing and you know that's when see but if a guide doesn't know how to handle danger like I said if we went to took a kiwi guide to to Africa and a and an elephant comes charging through the bush he just panick he has never experienced it how can you know but but if he had experience with those kind of crisis we could have confidence in him yes sir so we've got to you know you have to have confidence in your guide now we can read through the scripture we can have a testimony service for a good few months just even right here to hear about what our guide has done amen chrisis has struck this is what he did this happened this is what he did I needed help here this is what he did Hallelujah those who stuck close to the guide they can say this is what his character that comes out Amen in time of trouble you're right Hallelujah if we have confidence in our guide if you have confidence in your guide you know when a storm strike something unexpected happens you know he's going to look after you I mean you fall over and Brak your leg in the middle of the Bush he's not going to panic and you're not going to panic cuz he's not panicking you ever seen your children you know they can hurt themselves and you know if the parents kind of grab them if they look really worried then then then the children start crying but if you don't act that way they don't cry why cuz they're actually looking up they know something happen they can feel the pain they're looking up at mommy or daddy and they and and they're trying to gauge how they're looking at them to see the severity of the of the accident true that's right amen we have an accident we we look up at the Lord and he's not panicking we can go it's not so bad after all you know he's got it in control amen so we got to have confidence in our guide Hallelujah now those who follow a guide over time they begin to act like their guide they begin to think like their guide and they begin to behave like their guide right those who have the right kind of guide now really the life that is manifesting in us right now shows what what's guiding us right now so if the Holy Ghost is guiding us we'll begin to act like the Holy Ghost we will think like the Holy Ghost which is the word we will talk like the word we'll act like the word and then when the enemy comes in we'll respond like the word responds right because the word is our guid amen amen if if religion is our guide well we can see what the Pharisees did and the scribes did whenever the word manifested himself in their presence and that's the response you'll see so you got to think about now what because we all we all start acting like our guide if the world is our guide we'll act like the world think like the world talk like the world dress like the world behave like the world if that's our guide but I have no confidence in that kind of guide he gets you into trouble then he just just does a runner leaves you to face the lion but if we have the Lord Jesus as our guide will end up acting like him in every situation Hallelujah but you got to be surrended remember man man can't be his own guide it's either you being the guide or God being the guide we read that quote before so we have to be yielded to a guide it all depends now now the problem is we have a lot of reasoning going on in our minds man can justify himself really well you know I wish I had a picture of it but it was on the news there was this guy I don't know how ended up there but there was a guy he was 100 odd miles off the coast of America and he was hanging on to the end of his camam which was sinking and he was there for a couple of days and he got rescued by a um a container ship and there's a photo there's only this much he's he's literally just say if if if from the floor to the ceiling was the amount of boat that was sticking out of the water was like this he's hanging on to the end of it and then there's a picture of him climbing up the stairs coming onto the containership that rescued him wow and he looks real happy that he's alive cuz he's in the middle of the Pacific hundreds of miles from anywhere and his boat sinking and it's been sinking for two days wow now I don't know what guided him out there but he found himself in a real sticky situation that unless unless help comes he's going to die he can't swim somewhere he can't call someone somehow they maybe had a locat beacon I don't know but you know it was either if that ship didn't get to him in time he was going to drown now you say well why do you say that I don't know what guided him out there but he called help and help got him amen and that's the thing with our guide he's a present help in time of trouble Hallelujah he's a present help in time of trouble but you've got to have confidence you may be in a very dark spot you going to have confidence help is on its way Hallelujah Jesus is coming amen the guide is coming Hallelujah it took him 4 days to get to lazarus's tomb but he got the grave but he got there and Lazarus came out Hallelujah Jesus may you know he's always on time but now I just want to stick this just I mean we just got to close with this we're got to stay behind this word we've never been this way before amen this could be the last well you probably say this every year this could be the last year we're on the earth the world has you know if we could maybe we'll you know no one ever predicted 2020 would be like this but here we are you say well we're Co free the the world is not Co free we're stuck on this island here we are you know no one would have predicted this but this is where we are but we got to have confidence our guide has told us there would be pestilence in the end time right our guide said there'll be mental pressure and depression and and and how the back in the 60s our guide told us that mental illness will be R in the end time amen right and depression and people on prescription drugs trying to stay level and things it's all in the church age book it's all in the message right men's Hearts failing for fear our guide has laid out where we are that's right right we're not just actually stumbling along in darkness people think well you know the message couldn't see into 2020 It's s into 2020 it's more up to date in 2020 than it was in 1965 amen yes sir Hallelujah but you got to look and you got to talk to the guide you got to look at the guide say guide where are come on what's Happening Here I said I'll show you what you see around you I'll show you I've already laid it in the word you just got to look at what the guide says am Hallelujah that's true so that's why we've got to stay behind the word amen like Joshua told them you have not been this way before we haven't been on this is a unique Journey he's telling them and this is a unique Journey that we're on why is it unique cuz they which are alive and remain Hallelujah are going to be with the resurrected Saints going to meet the Lord in the air there's never been a generation on the earth that are the alive and remain right everyone everyone in the past thought they were the alive and remain but we are I'm alive and remain amen those who remain in the truth and alive in Christ we know those who died in Christ they'll come forth first but they all died with that promise but there's going to be people that are alive and remain amen so we're going to stay with this word friends it'll see us through but when Christ strikes what guide do you lean to do you try and sort it out or do you let him sort it out I want the professional I'm not the professional this is Amateur hour he's the professional you've got to have you got to have him lead and guide your life you say I've got it all sorted out that guy with the boat maybe I'll try and find pictures for Sunday maybe he when he set off from the jety there I've got it all sorted I've got my Locator Beacon I've got my rations I've got my fuel I've got my life raft it's fine and he's hanging on a boat for two end of his boat for two days and he's I doubt very much he thought in his mind it's fine yeah all he can do is hold on for dear life and and and pray I don't know if he's a Christian I don't know but basically hold on for dear life and pray that help would come and I'm so thankful we may get into dire spots like that and help was on its way and it's closer than a container ship of the Pacific Ocean amen the Lord say he's not far from any one of us Amen Hallelujah Lord amen so let's um are you glad you got a guide who's got the Lord as a guide he's my gu hallelujah amen let's um let's let's sing a song shall we and then we'll
