[45:17] can turn in our bibles please to
[45:20] um
[45:22] um to
[45:24] you know the desire of god is a very
[45:25] broad subject so you can use any
[45:27] scriptures in the bible basically to
[45:29] back up what you're saying so and i just
[45:31] had so much inspiration you know
[45:34] of this subject and so amen like yeah
[45:37] just everything spoke to me about it so
[45:39] i've narrowed it down now under the
[45:41] lord's leading to a few scriptures and
[45:43] we've got one here in joel chapter 2
[45:46] and we're going to read from 21 to 27
[45:50] amen
[45:52] hallelujah then we're going to turn to
[45:53] jeremiah 29
[45:55] and we're going to read verses 11 and
[45:57] 12. i want you to think about god's
[45:59] desire for you
[46:01] what does he want
[46:03] what does god want you know what is his
[46:05] desire
[46:06] you know sometimes we we think of god as
[46:09] he's just so mighty that it's all just
[46:10] this big sterile plan and it's all just
[46:13] going to happen as he foresaw it and
[46:14] foreign but woven through it all is
[46:17] god's heart and his feelings he's a
[46:20] person
[46:21] and he feels pain and he feels you and
[46:24] he and you and and he's looking for a
[46:26] heartfelt religion amen
[46:29] hallelujah
[46:31] amen
[46:33] he says here in verse 21 it says fear
[46:36] not o land be glad and rejoice
[46:39] for the lord will do great things be not
[46:42] afraid you beast of the field for the
[46:44] pastures of the wilderness do spring for
[46:47] the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree
[46:49] and the vine do yield their strength
[46:52] be glad then ye children of zion and
[46:55] rejoice in the lord your god for he hath
[46:58] given you the former rain moderately and
[47:00] he will cause to come down to you
[47:03] for you the rain the former rain and the
[47:06] latter rain in the first month
[47:08] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[47:11] hallelujah can everyone just say full of
[47:12] wheat
[47:14] amen and the fats shall overflow with
[47:16] wine and oil amen who wants to claim
[47:19] that for themselves tonight
[47:21] that's god's desire for you he wants you
[47:24] to have that and i believe that you do
[47:27] have that and he wants you to walk in
[47:29] that and realize that and just
[47:31] i don't know just bask in it hallelujah
[47:34] hey man just just go over the top hey
[47:36] man let's go over the top tonight amen
[47:39] let's not go under the power let's go
[47:41] over the top hallelujah amen you give
[47:44] them more praise than you can hallelujah
[47:47] and you drink more water than you need
[47:48] amen who believes that we should do that
[47:51] it's very good amen hallelujah i'm going
[47:54] to get carried away so i just keep
[47:56] reading hallelujah so and the and
[47:59] i love this so much
[48:01] and i will restore to you the years that
[48:03] the locust has eaten
[48:05] the cankerworm
[48:07] and the caterpillar and the parma worm
[48:09] my great army which i sent among you
[48:12] and you shall eat and plenty and be
[48:15] satisfied and praise the name of the
[48:17] lord your god that has dealt wondrously
[48:20] with you
[48:21] and i love this and my people shall
[48:23] never be ashamed
[48:25] and ye shall know that i am in the
[48:28] midst of israel and that i am the lord
[48:30] your god and none else
[48:33] and my people shall never be ashamed
[48:36] hallelujah you can have your seats god
[48:38] bless you
[48:41] you know he says my people shall never
[48:43] be ashamed he didn't say that once he
[48:44] said it twice and i believe he's talking
[48:46] about his bride and i believe he's
[48:47] talking about israel
[48:51] he's talking about you and he's talking
[48:52] about the jews
[48:54] because they're his people there's two
[48:56] groups of people that shall never be
[48:58] ashamed amen you know why because he
[49:00] bore your shame
[49:01] he took your burdens upon himself
[49:04] hallelujah i believe tonight if you want
[49:07] to leave the service changed
[49:09] you need a pool
[49:11] if you're just going to sit here and
[49:12] wonder what brother andy's going to say
[49:13] you're going to get nothing
[49:15] you're going to get nothing and your
[49:16] black dog's going to get fed so you just
[49:18] do that if you want to leave the service
[49:20] down but if you want to leave the
[49:21] service on fire if you want to leave the
[49:24] service with a spiritual strength pull
[49:26] right now i challenge you i challenge
[49:29] you to a jewel of pulling and if you
[49:32] keep pulling it'll just keep coming out
[49:34] if you want me to stop just stop pulling
[49:36] amen
[49:37] don't stop pulling
[49:41] but this is how it works okay this is
[49:43] how it works it's not a one-way thing
[49:45] here this is a two-way amen and if you
[49:48] want to have a good time let's have a
[49:50] two-way thing going on amen glory to god
[49:52] amen we've got that straight hallelujah
[49:54] god has a desire for you to leave the
[49:56] service changed god has a desire for you
[49:59] to be restored to have all your walls
[50:01] you know like a city a city's got walls
[50:04] and you know the city of the of
[50:05] jerusalem it was like a living organism
[50:07] built in a in an architectural structure
[50:10] you know that we're not going to get
[50:12] right into that because that's not the
[50:13] scope but it was it had all these
[50:16] different gates and walls and it was
[50:17] like a living being
[50:19] you know that a living organism and it
[50:21] had to function so it would work
[50:22] properly as a city and god's desire to
[50:25] you is that you would be a thriving
[50:29] bustling jerusalem hallelujah with all
[50:31] your gates working with everything
[50:33] working and with you as a son and
[50:35] daughter of god walking on the water
[50:37] because you're going into a storm i'm
[50:39] going into a storm we're actually not
[50:40] going we're in it
[50:42] hallelujah who believes we're in it amen
[50:45] and you know god's calling us as sons
[50:47] and daughters to crest every wave
[50:49] he didn't say there wouldn't be waves
[50:51] the prophet says in the stabilization we
[50:53] talked about stabilizing the ship we're
[50:55] going to crest
[50:56] every wave amen hallelujah and god's
[51:00] calling you not even you know we're
[51:02] going higher than just being in a boat
[51:03] now amen because the you see you've got
[51:06] to go further than just being in a boat
[51:08] you've god's calling you to walk on the
[51:10] water
[51:11] he's calling you out of the boat tonight
[51:14] oh lord you might be in the boat of your
[51:15] house you might be in the boat of your
[51:17] family you might be in the boat of your
[51:18] mummy and daddy hallelujah but tonight
[51:20] god's calling you out of that boat
[51:22] it's time to come out of the boat sons
[51:24] and daughters of god sons and daughters
[51:26] of melchizedek sons and daughters of he
[51:28] who walked on the water amen and he
[51:31] didn't rock he didn't go that way or
[51:32] that way he just stayed straight and he
[51:35] crested every wave who believes that
[51:37] jesus crested every wave
[51:39] every wave
[51:41] he didn't go left or ride or twist this
[51:43] way and that way and get scared he was
[51:45] completely he was completely immune to
[51:48] all the storm completely immune
[51:51] who wants to be immune
[51:53] invincible i said to my children last
[51:55] night i said you can be in such a place
[51:58] with god
[51:59] that you're invincible
[52:01] nothing can hurt you
[52:03] and this is a very this is this sounds
[52:05] very far-fetched right because we're now
[52:07] dealing in a natural thing
[52:09] the prophet said that you could you can
[52:11] have faith and no fear and no reaction
[52:14] and a hot fat that which would melt your
[52:16] skin will land on there and it wouldn't
[52:19] hurt you
[52:20] who's heard that before
[52:21] and you know you look at that and you go
[52:23] whoa
[52:24] it's pretty it's pretty like you know
[52:26] that's right there that's right there
[52:28] now that is an invincible person amen
[52:31] hallelujah that cannot be touched by any
[52:33] wiles or snares of the devil and god is
[52:36] calling you tonight his desire for you
[52:39] is to come out of the boat of your camp
[52:41] come out of the boat of your comfort
[52:43] come out of the boat of your will
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:48] come out of the boat amen
[52:50] now peter was called out of the boat
[52:52] and peter had faith but you see peter
[52:54] led a church age that could not go on a
[52:57] rapture
[52:58] it will go on the rapture but it could
[52:59] not be the dead in christ uh the the
[53:01] live and remaining they'll be raised up
[53:04] so it symbolized and peter yes that age
[53:07] began to walk on the water began to
[53:09] crest every wave they came into a place
[53:11] of perfect love they came into an
[53:12] economy that could that was in god was
[53:15] imperfection and it was unconditional
[53:17] love and it was it was so perfect
[53:20] and they crested every wave and peter
[53:22] was cresting every wave that first
[53:24] church age cresting cresting no effect
[53:27] amen hallelujah he could walk on the
[53:29] water amen and that first church began
[53:31] to walk on the water but then they
[53:34] looked around and they began to get
[53:36] sinked down amen they began to sink down
[53:38] because god was his desire was to see
[53:42] the pattern of nature in the church his
[53:44] desire was to see a seed go on the
[53:46] ground so that seed went into the ground
[53:48] underground and came back out but now
[53:50] hallelujah
[53:52] who knows where i'm going
[53:54] but now
[53:56] god's desire is not another seed in the
[53:59] ground amen that seed's been in the
[54:01] ground and it's come out and he's
[54:03] restored it and his desire is that you
[54:05] would be a thriving son and daughter of
[54:06] god that you would rise up and you would
[54:09] crystally wave and you ain't going to
[54:10] sink
[54:12] no sinking
[54:14] amen
[54:15] no sinking
[54:16] hallelujah
[54:18] amen
[54:29] jeremiah 29 11 12 it says for i know the
[54:31] thoughts that i think toward you
[54:34] saith the lord thoughts of peace
[54:36] and not of evil to give you an expected
[54:38] end
[54:39] amen then shall you call upon me
[54:43] and you shall go and pray unto me and i
[54:45] will hearken
[54:47] to you hallelujah
[54:49] god was speaking this to these people
[54:52] because through jeremiah he prophesied
[54:54] of a of a time of judgment where israel
[54:57] had fallen so far away from god
[55:00] and and they had begun to worship all
[55:02] these idols in the peace and and
[55:04] taking on the religions of the land
[55:06] and so god said you know according to
[55:09] the law of moses that they would be
[55:10] banished from the land
[55:12] and so
[55:14] through but yet god always left them
[55:16] with a way out amen and so you see now
[55:19] after he said yes you're going to go but
[55:21] you're going to come back
[55:23] and i these are actually the thoughts i
[55:24] think towards you my people
[55:27] i'm not thinking towards you all this
[55:28] destruction that's not the end the end
[55:31] is i'm going to hearken to you i'm going
[55:32] to bring you back amen and you might
[55:35] have gone far from god we do sometimes
[55:37] go far in our actions and things but
[55:40] never too far for god to say this is
[55:42] what i really think of you this is my
[55:44] desire for you tonight i have my desire
[55:47] for you towards you is thoughts of peace
[55:50] amen
[55:51] not of evil
[55:52] to give you an expected end
[55:55] hallelujah then shall you call upon me
[55:57] and shall go and pray unto me and i will
[55:59] hearken unto you amen
[56:02] and it says here in hebrews 12 2 looking
[56:04] unto jesus the author and finisher of
[56:07] our faith who for the joy that was set
[56:09] before him endured the cross despising
[56:12] the shame and has sat down at the right
[56:14] hand of the throne of god
[56:17] amen you see there was a desire in him
[56:20] amen do you know what desire means i
[56:22] looked up the definition of desire and
[56:23] it says a conscious
[56:25] impulse towards something that promises
[56:28] enjoyment
[56:29] oh my
[56:31] hallelujah
[56:32] you see there was a prospect within his
[56:35] heart of a people
[56:37] and that their life and their redemption
[56:40] and them coming into sonship and then
[56:42] coming off out of the world and coming
[56:44] to know him would promise him enjoyment
[56:47] you see you are a bringer of joy to the
[56:50] lord and his desire for you is to take
[56:53] you above sin above unbelief above lust
[56:57] above fear above all the works of the
[56:59] devil and all the things of the flesh
[57:01] above yourself
[57:04] above your limitations above the things
[57:06] that have troubled you all your life and
[57:07] the things that's come through your
[57:08] family and all these things god's desire
[57:11] is to take you higher than that
[57:13] to bring you above it
[57:15] who believes that tonight
[57:18] hallelujah
[57:20] hallelujah
[57:22] amen
[57:23] because you god is calling us now this
[57:26] is not just in some one-way thing amen
[57:29] this is not a one-way thing where you
[57:31] know we just follow this thing and we
[57:32] enjoy it but actually it's a two-part
[57:35] thing with us and god
[57:36] and just as you are rejoicing
[57:39] he's rejoicing
[57:41] and you know as you come into the holy
[57:42] of holies and your walk gets holier and
[57:46] i don't just mean by your behavior i'm
[57:47] talking about your heart your faith your
[57:49] your connection with god your worship
[57:52] amen when you sit in church
[57:54] are you getting anything
[57:57] are you getting something
[57:59] or is your mind not in it
[58:02] has something broken you from the
[58:04] household of god is something broken
[58:06] your connection with god tonight it can
[58:08] be fixed
[58:10] right now it can be fixed
[58:12] right here
[58:14] it doesn't have to be here at the altar
[58:15] just right in your seat right now
[58:17] right now you can have a connection with
[58:19] the one that you this is what you want
[58:21] you see
[58:23] we think we know what we want
[58:25] oh my we think we know i want this and i
[58:27] want to be that and i want to do this
[58:28] because this is going to make me happy
[58:29] but it ain't going to really make you
[58:30] that happy
[58:32] i tell you what's really going to make
[58:33] you happy is when god comes into your
[58:35] life when you receive the holy ghost
[58:38] amen and then
[58:40] it gets better and better you know
[58:41] because when you first receive the holy
[58:43] ghost man you're having a good time but
[58:44] then it becomes more and more of a love
[58:46] more and more since like a real depth
[58:50] hallelujah it's like a marriage you know
[58:52] it's like there's cloud nine and then it
[58:54] just gets deeper and deeper and deeper
[58:57] providing that marriage is centered on
[58:59] christ providing this healing in the
[59:01] camp providing that family altar has god
[59:04] in the center amen it just brings the
[59:06] people together amen hallelujah and it's
[59:09] the same when the holy ghost comes into
[59:11] your life and gives you that joy that
[59:13] you need
[59:14] you know he says that i i can't remember
[59:16] the first part of the verse but he said
[59:18] the the promise in this verse is that he
[59:20] will give you rivers of pleasure
[59:23] and you know just about everything that
[59:25] we do we do for pleasure
[59:28] you just do it you just want to be we
[59:30] just want to sit there and be pleased
[59:33] and not do anything right that's kind of
[59:35] the human nature
[59:37] oh my you see and and really
[59:40] we're in in christ and in the holy ghost
[59:43] that's that's actually the condition
[59:45] that we live in
[59:47] that will be in a constant joy that you
[59:49] can't even fathom
[59:51] you can't even imagine it the prophet
[59:53] could not even describe it in english
[59:54] language that's what we will exist in
[59:57] because there's no corruption there
[1:00:00] but yet there is an unconditional love
[1:00:02] within us to
[1:00:04] drive us to serve
[1:00:06] and to to participate in life because
[1:00:09] there's going to be a normal life over
[1:00:10] there we're going to live we're going to
[1:00:12] fellowship we're going to do things
[1:00:14] prophet says we're going to work
[1:00:16] you know that everyone's probably like
[1:00:18] oh my we're going to work
[1:00:20] this is going to be good work man we're
[1:00:21] going to have a good time
[1:00:23] amazing time and you won't have you
[1:00:25] won't get paid one cent
[1:00:28] and you'll love that
[1:00:30] because you'll realize that that whole
[1:00:31] payment system is satanic did you know
[1:00:34] that who knows that the monetary system
[1:00:35] is satanic
[1:00:37] it's the only way satan can get a bunch
[1:00:39] of falling no hopers to do something
[1:00:41] sorry not us but this world that's a
[1:00:44] very general statement
[1:00:48] that's the only way
[1:00:49] that the devil can get this world to
[1:00:51] work is by paying them something because
[1:00:53] no one wants to do anything for free now
[1:00:55] i'm not attacking anybody because you
[1:00:56] know we have to actually go and work we
[1:00:59] the the lord said we've got to be in
[1:01:00] this but not all this all right so who's
[1:01:02] who's we're in it but we're not of it
[1:01:04] all right amen hallelujah

[1:02:25] oh man
[1:02:26] that's one way to get distracted isn't
[1:02:28] it man
[1:02:30] you see
[1:02:32] he set this up
[1:02:33] the whole thing's set up so that you can
[1:02:35] have a real good marian martha balance
[1:02:40] he's it's it's fully set up man it's
[1:02:42] this is rigged
[1:02:43] it's completely rigged
[1:02:44] you don't have to serve no monetary
[1:02:46] system you don't have to serve the
[1:02:48] devil's storm you know you know i don't
[1:02:50] know if i spoke to i think i spoke to
[1:02:51] john or someone about this and because
[1:02:53] it came so clearly to me about a week
[1:02:55] two three weeks ago
[1:02:56] the monetary system is a storm
[1:03:00] it's a storm
[1:03:03] you know that you know what a storm is a
[1:03:05] a storm is satan's kingdom the whole
[1:03:08] thing is one big storm and it's got lots
[1:03:10] of little storms inside of it and a
[1:03:12] storm if you look at it it you know it
[1:03:14] just it's just this terrible chaotic
[1:03:16] thing that just gets bigger and bigger
[1:03:18] and bigger and then disappears
[1:03:20] and it hit and it doesn't have any fun
[1:03:22] foundation it's at all it causes is
[1:03:24] destruction confusion
[1:03:27] wrecks things and that's the devil
[1:03:29] system and the monetary system is just
[1:03:31] the perfect example of that
[1:03:34] it's that you you take this this value
[1:03:37] and first of all it was real trade and
[1:03:40] then it became a gold piece and that
[1:03:43] gold had value in itself and then it
[1:03:45] became something that represented the
[1:03:47] gold and the gold was in the bank and
[1:03:48] then they took the gold out of the bank
[1:03:49] and all you had was this thing that
[1:03:51] represented what gold should be in the
[1:03:52] bank was not even there but then it got
[1:03:54] even more than it even it became value
[1:03:57] that was that the bank could lend way
[1:04:00] more than it even had
[1:04:03] and make money off it
[1:04:05] you know this is this is the and what
[1:04:07] happens is that value because of all
[1:04:09] that that value of that dollar has
[1:04:12] become less and less because it just
[1:04:13] goes bigger and bigger and bigger it's
[1:04:14] like a big storm and that is a life
[1:04:17] that's like without god
[1:04:20] if you walk away from the lord and you
[1:04:21] begin to trust in yourself and trust
[1:04:23] lean to your own understanding and you
[1:04:25] begin to go to the way of the world and
[1:04:26] you begin to go the way of a prodigal
[1:04:28] and you begin to go this different way
[1:04:30] that is not the way of the lord then you
[1:04:32] enter a storm
[1:04:34] you enter a place of perpetual
[1:04:38] destruction perpet unfounded
[1:04:41] unsatisfactory and and all you have to
[1:04:44] do is keep building it and building it
[1:04:45] building and getting better and better
[1:04:47] and better you come this big thing and
[1:04:48] then all of a sudden you crash
[1:04:50] crash down
[1:04:51] because you're in a storm
[1:04:53] it's not stable am i
[1:04:55] who loves stable
[1:04:57] who loves paradise
[1:04:58] you know this is this big storm and it
[1:05:00] just gets bigger and better and just you
[1:05:02] know you go out there and you just go
[1:05:03] real bad or you go real into something
[1:05:06] and your life even you cannot it doesn't
[1:05:08] even have to look that bad you might
[1:05:09] even still come to church but you're in
[1:05:11] a storm
[1:05:12] because something happened something
[1:05:13] tipped you over or you're going through
[1:05:15] a trial whatever it may be
[1:05:16] that's an individual walk
[1:05:18] and you're going through and it's
[1:05:19] getting worse and worse and bigger and
[1:05:20] bigger and the foundation's ripped from
[1:05:22] underneath you
[1:05:23] because you the storm
[1:05:25] there's no foundation
[1:05:27] oh my this is the devil's way this is
[1:05:29] his kingdom when you trust in money you
[1:05:31] begin to follow money you begin to go
[1:05:32] for the pursue the things of this world
[1:05:34] and you and you go out there and you
[1:05:36] look for the the whatever you want to
[1:05:38] call it you know
[1:05:39] of the world the pearl of the world
[1:05:41] which is gold
[1:05:43] all it does is pavement
[1:05:46] you're going to walk it's just pavement
[1:05:48] you know
[1:05:48] that's all it is
[1:05:50] you don't have to chase this
[1:05:52] our mind god has rigged this thing for
[1:05:55] you
[1:05:56] just says just seek me first
[1:05:59] put me first when you come to church
[1:06:02] children young people don't just wait
[1:06:04] for the service to finish
[1:06:06] oh my
[1:06:08] honestly
[1:06:10] and i know this i don't want to be a
[1:06:11] broken record but you know

[1:06:22] years
[1:06:23] i'm going to sit in this church and and
[1:06:25] you might be in a place where you just
[1:06:27] have to be here and you don't know why
[1:06:28] or you don't get much but there is a
[1:06:30] place that you can get something
[1:06:32] you can actually young people children
[1:06:35] there's no limit god's not looking at
[1:06:37] your age and thinking oh he's too young
[1:06:38] i'm not going to bother with that boy
[1:06:39] i'm not going to bother with that girl
[1:06:40] she's too young doesn't understand god
[1:06:43] understands and god can speak to you in
[1:06:45] your way in your level in your language
[1:06:48] he can tell you what you're thinking
[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:52] because you see there's a purpose of the
[1:06:53] service and it's oh man and
[1:06:57] i know what brother ben i i just you you
[1:06:59] feel it it's like man let's not waste
[1:07:01] the time
[1:07:02] let's enter in with all of our heart
[1:07:05] hallelujah you want to get something
[1:07:07] real tonight
[1:07:08] hallelujah
[1:07:10] because you see you can sit in the
[1:07:11] service and the purpose is that you
[1:07:13] would give god all the glory and he
[1:07:14] would do something for you he would help
[1:07:16] you you would leave different you would
[1:07:18] have something changed in your life or
[1:07:20] god just the spirit of god can just
[1:07:23] man he could really do something for you
[1:07:25] of whatever scale it is
[1:07:27] momentous things in your life
[1:07:30] he can take you
[1:07:32] from influences of evil
[1:07:34] there's influences that are all around
[1:07:36] us and they're infiltrating at every
[1:07:38] point and when you begin to open your
[1:07:40] heart to those things and they get your
[1:07:44] joy
[1:07:45] and you begin to draw from them joy and
[1:07:48] you begin to get comfort from these
[1:07:49] things and it doesn't matter what it is
[1:07:51] whether it's your business whether it's
[1:07:53] your education whether it's your sport
[1:07:55] whether it's you know your religion
[1:07:58] your your performance in the church all
[1:08:00] those things don't feed your spirit man
[1:08:03] your inner man all those things do is
[1:08:05] feed the flesh
[1:08:07] and they make it harder for you to
[1:08:09] worship god they make it harder for you
[1:08:11] to pray they make it harder for you to
[1:08:13] enter in and have fellowship
[1:08:15] that's the that's the carnal mind
[1:08:18] the carnal mind is enmity
[1:08:21] against god
[1:08:22] the carnal mind has divided it's
[1:08:25] repulsive to god god sees it as
[1:08:28] repulsive and your carnal mind sees god
[1:08:31] as repulsive
[1:08:32] i know that sounds strong but that's
[1:08:34] what the bible says
[1:08:36] and you know i was thinking about that
[1:08:37] one night and it just dropped down it's
[1:08:39] the same as the serpent
[1:08:41] your carnal mind is serpent
[1:08:43] do you know that it's a serpentine
[1:08:46] ideology
[1:08:47] it's the carnality and when you if you
[1:08:49] don't feed the spiritual man and you
[1:08:51] begin to feed that carnal mind by doing
[1:08:54] good things
[1:08:55] and i'm going to say good things okay
[1:08:56] because that's going to be a little bit
[1:08:57] more striking than going out and
[1:08:59] committing sins and all sorts of stuff
[1:09:00] i'm talking about life i'm talking about
[1:09:02] business and i'm preaching to myself
[1:09:04] because i've got all those things
[1:09:05] happening to me
[1:09:07] so i'm preaching from experience i'm not
[1:09:09] just preaching uh someone else's
[1:09:11] experience i'm preaching exactly what
[1:09:13] i'm going through and go through and
[1:09:15] have gone through and have come out of
[1:09:16] and gone into and come out of and you
[1:09:18] know it's like man you've got to manage
[1:09:20] these things
[1:09:21] and we're in a world now and you're
[1:09:23] called to certain things and you're
[1:09:24] called to certain places and to be a
[1:09:25] witness now be careful
[1:09:28] martha
[1:09:29] how much you give
[1:09:31] be careful martha how much of your heart
[1:09:34] and your desire and your worship you
[1:09:36] begin to try and worship god through
[1:09:38] your works
[1:09:39] you try and worship god like martha oh
[1:09:42] i'm gonna serve i'm gonna make him so
[1:09:43] please i'm gonna do all these things and
[1:09:45] miss the very thing that mary had
[1:09:48] and so there we have to manage our
[1:09:51] output we've got to manage our time the
[1:09:54] bible says redeem the time for the days
[1:09:56] are evil
[1:09:59] everything is trying to take your
[1:10:01] attention it's trying to rob you it's
[1:10:03] trying to delay the inevitable do you
[1:10:06] know what the inevitable is
[1:10:08] oh my
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] oh my you can just start shouting and
[1:10:11] rejoicing right now the inevitable is
[1:10:13] your body change
[1:10:14] hallelujah the inevitable is the devil's
[1:10:17] under your feet
[1:10:18] it's inevitable who knows what
[1:10:20] inevitable means
[1:10:21] it has to happen doesn't matter whether
[1:10:24] he's kicking screaming whatever
[1:10:26] and and remember this the devil was
[1:10:29] wounded a mortal blow
[1:10:31] at calvary
[1:10:33] and he became very vicious see how
[1:10:34] vicious he was when the when that life
[1:10:37] that was in christ came unto the
[1:10:38] disciples and they and they took a man
[1:10:40] who was limping and made him leap
[1:10:44] when they did that through the power of
[1:10:46] god through them then the viciousness of
[1:10:49] the devil came upon them and they were
[1:10:50] beaten and they were scourged and they
[1:10:52] were removed from their position in
[1:10:54] society because of the life
[1:10:57] and then the devil began to
[1:11:00] push the church down and it became
[1:11:02] religious and the true seed was getting
[1:11:04] less and less and less and pressured and
[1:11:06] down underground but then one day
[1:11:07] hallelujah you know and then it started
[1:11:09] raising up and it was still
[1:11:11] denominational denominational but then
[1:11:13] one day hallelujah a mighty angel came
[1:11:16] down with an open book to give back the
[1:11:19] fullness
[1:11:20] however to give back the inheritance
[1:11:23] that inheritance tonight my brothers and
[1:11:26] sisters that inheritance tonight is in
[1:11:28] the hand of the mighty angel ready for
[1:11:31] you to take it amen
[1:11:33] hallelujah
[1:11:36] now man we've taken it right who's taken
[1:11:39] the book who's eating the book
[1:11:41] who's feasting
[1:11:43] amen now i want you to feast
[1:11:46] go beyond the camp of your own
[1:11:48] oh my let me not say it i'm not gonna go
[1:11:51] too far into that
[1:11:52] hallelujah go beyond the camp
[1:11:56] hallelujah

[1:12:00] you to not feed on the book
[1:12:03] that are influencing you away
[1:12:05] you have to say no
[1:12:07] i'm gonna just say no
[1:12:09] because you see they are trying to delay
[1:12:11] the inevitable
[1:12:13] it's the spirit in them it's not your
[1:12:15] friend
[1:12:16] friends are lovely i've got friends out
[1:12:18] there

[1:12:22] pull me away from my inheritance i'm not
[1:12:25] going to let them pull me out of my joy

[1:12:28] my rejoicing not going to let them pull
[1:12:30] me out of my freedom who wants who no
[1:12:32] one in here should would whatever want
[1:12:35] to be pulled out of your freedom pulled

[1:12:39] privilege
[1:12:40] hallelujah
[1:12:42] oh my
[1:12:44] hallelujah
[1:12:47] you see god has a desire
[1:12:49] and his desire is a complete restoration
[1:12:52] of your life
[1:12:53] his desire is so strong that he's not
[1:12:55] looking at all your mistakes
[1:12:57] he's not looking at all of your
[1:12:59] shortcomings he's not worried about any
[1:13:02] of those things he's not worried about
[1:13:04] the performance of your flesh
[1:13:06] oh my he's not looking at all that he
[1:13:08] has a desire and he has spoken it and it
[1:13:11] does thus say of the lord that you have
[1:13:13] been restored and there is a full
[1:13:15] provision over you and in you and
[1:13:17] through you
[1:13:19] to see it all manifest that's god's
[1:13:21] desire for you regardless of your
[1:13:23] performance regardless of your
[1:13:24] personality regardless of your complexes
[1:13:27] regardless of all those things god is
[1:13:29] calling you to crest every wave to walk
[1:13:32] on the water to ride above the storm to
[1:13:35] live in victory
[1:13:37] who wants to live in full victory amen
[1:13:39] let me tell you the stabilizers are in
[1:13:41] the ship the stabilizers are in you amen
[1:13:46] hallelujah
[1:13:49] you know
[1:13:50] when you find your life
[1:13:53] rocking left and right
[1:13:55] unstable
[1:13:57] tossed about
[1:14:00] you're emotional
[1:14:01] and you can't it's just uncontrollable
[1:14:04] and all these things begin to grip you
[1:14:05] and change you and take you in this
[1:14:07] direction in that direction
[1:14:09] but there is a stabilization
[1:14:12] there is a real
[1:14:14] man
[1:14:15] that can turn on the light
[1:14:17] in your engine room
[1:14:20] you know we've got an engine room
[1:14:22] you know that engine room is your
[1:14:24] subconscious
[1:14:25] and it's full of all sorts of memories
[1:14:27] and things that you've been through and
[1:14:29] stuff that gets activated when you don't
[1:14:31] want it and all of a sudden you do
[1:14:32] something you didn't mean to do or you
[1:14:34] you didn't do something that you were
[1:14:36] meant to do and it stops you
[1:14:38] and i'm talking real things too like
[1:14:40] believing
[1:14:41] to receive healing or believing to
[1:14:43] receive the holy ghost that you can be
[1:14:45] hindered from receiving the baptism of
[1:14:47] the holy spirit by your subconscious
[1:14:49] just not believing or not being able to
[1:14:51] believe maybe a dead figure in your life
[1:14:53] hurt you and broke that channel of you
[1:14:57] trusting your father and that goes
[1:14:59] subconsciously to your heavenly father
[1:15:01] but tonight there's healing in the cup
[1:15:03] tonight there's healing god has just got
[1:15:06] a desire for you to be healed from that
[1:15:09] god's got a desire for you to be healed
[1:15:11] so that you can receive the holy ghost
[1:15:13] god's got a desire for you to be healed
[1:15:16] from anything that your parents ever did
[1:15:18] to you
[1:15:19] amen because remember parents aren't
[1:15:21] always perfect and parents made mistakes
[1:15:23] i make mistakes we all make mistakes and
[1:15:26] we all create complexes in our children
[1:15:28] that they may not even see until they're
[1:15:31] old
[1:15:33] that's the subconscious that's the
[1:15:34] engine room but there's a man in this
[1:15:36] place
[1:15:37] that can turn on the light in your
[1:15:39] engine room
[1:15:40] there's a man in this place his name is
[1:15:42] jesus
[1:15:43] and he can come into your engine room
[1:15:45] tonight and heal those little things
[1:15:48] that can take away your privileges and
[1:15:51] you know they're your privileges and
[1:15:53] they're given to you and you've got that
[1:15:55] you know you you serve the lord and you
[1:15:56] you you just worship him as best as you
[1:15:58] know how as the prophet would say and
[1:16:01] and and he would take you further and
[1:16:02] deeper
[1:16:03] and then you come across things that you
[1:16:05] feel like what's going on
[1:16:07] and it's that
[1:16:08] there's things
[1:16:09] and it's time then and you begin to fail
[1:16:11] and you begin to go through something
[1:16:13] and a storm begins to start raging just
[1:16:15] remember who's in the boat
[1:16:17] remember there's a stabilization
[1:16:19] hallelujah
[1:16:21] and while you're cresting the waves
[1:16:23] going through the trials that god has
[1:16:24] ordained for you to go through you're
[1:16:26] cresting the waves stable
[1:16:29] who wants to be stable
[1:16:31] amen this
[1:16:32] storm we're in a storm but this ain't
[1:16:35] nothing
[1:16:36] this is nothing this whole covert thing
[1:16:38] is nothing
[1:16:40] i'm gonna read something
[1:16:42] my and it's very striking
[1:16:44] and if you've just been playing church
[1:16:47] tonight is the end of your church
[1:16:48] playing
[1:16:50] the end
[1:16:52] because you can now
[1:16:53] you will not survive this without a real
[1:16:56] experience from god
[1:16:57] oh my there's no way
[1:17:00] to go through the storm without the
[1:17:02] stabilizer in your ship
[1:17:04] you know the greatest technology
[1:17:06] hallelujah the greatest technology of
[1:17:09] stabilization is in the big ships
[1:17:11] and you know they create they go over
[1:17:12] some rough seas
[1:17:14] they go over like man it's so big and
[1:17:16] you look at who's ever watched a video
[1:17:18] of a boat going through a storm
[1:17:20] it's insane and i would not want to be
[1:17:23] in there man oh mate
[1:17:24] it's going up and it goes crash and
[1:17:27] water just goes everywhere it's massive
[1:17:30] i'm talking huge
[1:17:32] but within the engine room hallelujah
[1:17:35] of that ship
[1:17:37] it's going through the storm but it's
[1:17:38] just going straight
[1:17:44] and water and stuff is going everywhere
[1:17:46] millions of liters
[1:17:48] well maybe i don't know how many liters
[1:17:51] but lots
[1:17:52] it's going and it's just majestically
[1:17:54] crested
[1:17:56] you know and there's the captains on the
[1:17:57] ship he knows how to tackle that wave
[1:18:00] he's going up and down
[1:18:03] but down in the engine room
[1:18:05] as this technology
[1:18:07] is called gyroscopic
[1:18:09] technology
[1:18:11] no it's not no weight going that way or
[1:18:13] this or whatever no no no this is this
[1:18:16] is technology now
[1:18:17] and it goes and and it's called it's got
[1:18:19] these things that it's a wheel and a
[1:18:21] wheel
[1:18:22] and it spins like this who's ever no
[1:18:24] heard of inertia
[1:18:26] so if you get a big powerful drill or an
[1:18:29] engine and you turn it on it goes
[1:18:32] and you move it and it actually causes
[1:18:34] gravity it's got a different center of
[1:18:36] gravity it pulls because of the weight
[1:18:38] of the spinning parts
[1:18:40] that is the technology of stabilization
[1:18:42] very smart
[1:18:44] you see that's where the in the
[1:18:46] countdown the prophet
[1:18:47] joined technology and the revelation of
[1:18:51] god because you see as god reveals and
[1:18:53] begins to give to his church the tree of
[1:18:55] knowledge or also growing right up
[1:18:57] alongside it
[1:18:58] and technology starts to get released so
[1:19:00] you see now in the end time
[1:19:03] when god begin to release a
[1:19:06] stabilization into his church into his
[1:19:09] bride that would cause her to walk on
[1:19:11] the water
[1:19:12] here comes this technology in the marine
[1:19:15] industry that would cause a boat to come
[1:19:17] into a real stable and be able to crest
[1:19:20] the waves because of the stabilization
[1:19:22] so it will go up
[1:19:24] and down
[1:19:25] and up and down and crest the waves and
[1:19:28] get to its destination where before that
[1:19:30] just like a person and you can be a true
[1:19:33] believer
[1:19:34] but without the stabilizer in your ship
[1:19:36] without the stabilization of the holy
[1:19:38] ghost preeminent in your life oh my
[1:19:42] the ship goes like this and starts
[1:19:44] listing like that and listing and
[1:19:46] listing if it gets too much it just tips
[1:19:48] over and it's gone
[1:19:50] and that's like a ship like a person
[1:19:53] who
[1:19:54] has not got the stabilization of the
[1:19:56] holy ghost in their life
[1:19:59] who is just
[1:20:00] walking around
[1:20:01] and miserable got enough religion to be
[1:20:03] miserable and really just
[1:20:06] you just don't have any joy or
[1:20:08] you're a person who did have religion
[1:20:11] and it was heartfelt and something's
[1:20:13] happened in your life and you've lost it
[1:20:14] and you've lost your connection but
[1:20:16] tonight
[1:20:17] hallelujah
[1:20:18] in your ship in your engine room there's
[1:20:20] a man in this place that can turn on the
[1:20:22] light his name is jesus
[1:20:24] hallelujah he made provision for you
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:28] he made provision for you to be healed
[1:20:30] he made provision for you to be stable
[1:20:32] he made provision for you because the
[1:20:34] oncoming storm is going to be so raging
[1:20:37] it's going to be tsunamis of waves and
[1:20:39] all sorts of crashing in that way and if
[1:20:41] your ship is going
[1:20:43] like this and like this and crashing
[1:20:46] around what how will it survive
[1:20:49] but if your ship receives the wheel in
[1:20:52] the wheel
[1:20:53] if you're a ship receives the
[1:20:55] stabilization of the holy ghost and you
[1:20:57] give him preeminence and he begins to
[1:20:59] take over your life and you begin to
[1:21:01] feed the white dog and when you come to
[1:21:03] church you rejoice and you begin to
[1:21:06] worship god and out of your lips
[1:21:08] praise god
[1:21:11] is there anyone in this room that's
[1:21:12] never said praise god
[1:21:16] sincerely
[1:21:17] because if that is the case it's time
[1:21:20] for your lips to give our god praise
[1:21:23] hallelujah
[1:21:24] you'll be surprised the difference it
[1:21:26] makes when you really say it
[1:21:29] you really say praise the lord you see
[1:21:32] when i enter his gates with thanksgiving
[1:21:34] and his courts with praise who am i
[1:21:36] entering i'm entering the court of the
[1:21:38] holy of holies i'm coming into

[1:22:02] oncoming storm hallelujah
[1:22:05] amen you know it says that the wise

[1:23:31] economy it cannot work he tried it with
[1:23:34] communism
[1:23:36] communism doesn't work because it's got
[1:23:38] corrupt human beings that aren't
[1:23:39] converted that are unstable when the
[1:23:41] storms come and the temptations come for
[1:23:43] greed they just take advantage

[1:24:36] be so filled with his joy
[1:24:39] so full of his spirit amen
[1:24:42] tonight
[1:24:43] things can change
[1:24:46] just by a simple prayer
[1:24:48] amen don't think about your friends
[1:24:50] don't think about anyone else what
[1:24:51] anyone thinks just think about what he
[1:24:53] thinks because his thoughts are eternal
[1:24:55] everyone else's thoughts are just carnal
[1:24:57] and they are going to corrupt they're
[1:24:58] going to be forgotten so what your
[1:25:00] friends think of you now in 20 30 40 100
[1:25:03] years time will mean zulch
[1:25:06] who's heard that word zilch before
[1:25:09] hey man i don't mean sugar free food
[1:25:13] oh my
[1:25:15] they mean nothing the thoughts of your
[1:25:17] friends your school buddies whatever how
[1:25:19] they probably laugh at you for being a
[1:25:20] christian or you know like that you are
[1:25:22] going to a church you might not even
[1:25:24] identify as a christian because you feel
[1:25:26] ashamed
[1:25:28] all those thoughts are going to just
[1:25:29] absolutely be gone and never be
[1:25:31] remembered never to be remembered but
[1:25:33] god's thoughts
[1:25:34] are of peace and of an expected end and
[1:25:37] of eternal life and now right now
[1:25:40] not just in heaven but he wants to give
[1:25:42] you satisfaction and joy and a stable
[1:25:44] environment you know i talked about the
[1:25:47] storm and this tumultuous thing was
[1:25:49] unstable and it's just going in every
[1:25:51] direction and that's the devil's world
[1:25:53] and that's what he's got to offer and it
[1:25:55] might come in the form of you having a
[1:25:57] good time
[1:25:58] it might be something that your flesh
[1:26:00] enjoys
[1:26:01] but it never can last
[1:26:03] it always peters off it always changes
[1:26:06] it always turns into something corrupt
[1:26:08] it always takes you away from god it
[1:26:10] always takes you into a condition where
[1:26:11] you cannot sustain it it's unsustainable
[1:26:14] it's un you know it's not sustainable
[1:26:16] let's just leave it there
[1:26:18] but and you've got this big raging storm
[1:26:21] and rain and lightning and thunders and
[1:26:23] winds and all the stuff going and
[1:26:26] mudslides and everything that's what
[1:26:28] satan has to offer and it might you
[1:26:30] might enjoy it
[1:26:32] but it can't last
[1:26:34] and it will cause you to end up in hell
[1:26:38] but
[1:26:39] i know that doesn't sound very good it
[1:26:41] sounds very positive but this is the
[1:26:43] truth and i don't want to sugarcoat it
[1:26:45] but god and you take that big dark thing
[1:26:49] now if you want to take a picture of
[1:26:50] what god's life that he has to offer
[1:26:54] think of a beautiful
[1:26:56] green
[1:26:58] environment of just nice grass and a
[1:27:00] beautiful still lake that's just still
[1:27:02] and there's some just a nice real high
[1:27:05] little white cloud or and just a blue
[1:27:08] sky
[1:27:09] nice palm trees
[1:27:10] just a gentle cool breeze
[1:27:13] about 25 degrees celsius
[1:27:15] just still
[1:27:17] peaceful the birds chirping it's just
[1:27:19] still it's just calm
[1:27:21] and you can just sit there for eternity
[1:27:23] and fellowship
[1:27:24] it's eidetic
[1:27:25] that is what god if you could picture
[1:27:28] his life what he has to offer what the
[1:27:31] holy ghost is
[1:27:33] if you could just you know i know it's
[1:27:34] i'm not belittling the magnificence of
[1:27:37] god but i'm just trying to so that even
[1:27:39] the children can understand
[1:27:40] that
[1:27:41] that it's like paradise
[1:27:43] you know brother branham who knows that
[1:27:45] brother branham was taken beyond the
[1:27:46] curtain of time has everyone heard that
[1:27:48] story before
[1:27:49] and he says it was it was beyond sublime
[1:27:51] and it was just this beautiful place and
[1:27:53] everyone loved each other and there was
[1:27:54] no sexual connotations or there was no
[1:27:56] nothing like that there was nothing it
[1:27:58] was just perfect beautiful love
[1:28:00] and there was no yesterday no tomorrow
[1:28:02] it was all just now it was the most
[1:28:03] amazing
[1:28:05] and it was so stable and it's so
[1:28:06] sustainable
[1:28:09] that's what it's like that's what the
[1:28:11] and the voice said to him this is what
[1:28:12] you've preached this is the holy ghost
[1:28:15] it's perfect love perfect peace perfect
[1:28:18] satisfaction a and and sustainable now
[1:28:22] we're going to that place
[1:28:24] but let me tell you something when you
[1:28:26] receive the holy ghost
[1:28:29] when you get the baptism of the holy
[1:28:31] ghost and he gets preeminence in your
[1:28:32] life
[1:28:33] that that hap begins to form within you
[1:28:37] and and and you go from this storm
[1:28:40] of emotions and roller coasters and up
[1:28:42] and down and tossed about
[1:28:44] you have to go through it every son
[1:28:47] that cometh to god must go through these
[1:28:48] things
[1:28:49] because they're part of the deliverance
[1:28:51] they're part of you've got to take the
[1:28:53] enemies camp you've got to go and take
[1:28:55] your inheritance back but you've got to
[1:28:57] go through those things
[1:28:58] but you see
[1:29:00] you start off with this mess of a heart
[1:29:03] you start off with this destruction zone
[1:29:05] and it's full of all these idols and
[1:29:07] false religions and buddhism and
[1:29:09] hinduism and darkness and and and
[1:29:11] satanism and lust and selfishness
[1:29:14] and he comes into that
[1:29:16] do you know that that's what he comes
[1:29:18] into
[1:29:19] he comes in to begin to work in a life
[1:29:21] like that
[1:29:23] you know
[1:29:24] after the world is finished
[1:29:27] and and this and i'm remember i'm
[1:29:29] talking about god's desire because he
[1:29:30] has a desire to take your heart
[1:29:33] he's got his blood has got the power to
[1:29:34] change the vilest sinner's heart you may
[1:29:38] feel condemned because you may have bile
[1:29:41] things going on in your heart and you
[1:29:42] think that god doesn't want you he still
[1:29:44] wants you
[1:29:45] his desire doesn't change based on you
[1:29:47] having a bad
[1:29:48] season in your life and you go do the
[1:29:50] violence things or you think oh because
[1:29:51] i'm like this i can't even have a you
[1:29:53] can actually that can all be dealt with
[1:29:55] right now and you can pass the point of
[1:29:57] no return and come into christ so deep
[1:29:59] that the devil can't touch you again
[1:30:01] hallelujah
[1:30:04] oh man
[1:30:06] i just love these things so you see god
[1:30:08] is promising us us these things he's
[1:30:10] promising us this edenic condition so
[1:30:12] the earth you see and now when i saw
[1:30:15] talk about these desires of god he
[1:30:17] desires this for you but let me show you
[1:30:19] what he desires for the earth so that
[1:30:21] you can understand
[1:30:22] what he's come what he comes down to
[1:30:24] into your heart and to my heart what do
[1:30:26] you think he found in my heart i ain't
[1:30:28] going to go through it
[1:30:30] oh man
[1:30:32] do you think that if it was based on
[1:30:34] performance the lord would never come
[1:30:36] near me
[1:30:37] i'm such a bad man
[1:30:39] and so vile and so evil and and didn't
[1:30:42] even believe
[1:30:43] but he came
[1:30:44] hallelujah
[1:30:47] amen hallelujah i'm gonna i have to read
[1:30:49] something i hope it's not too late
[1:30:52] oh man
[1:30:53] i promise
[1:30:56] hallelujah
[1:30:58] after it's all been said and done after
[1:31:00] we've gone in the rapture
[1:31:02] you know we've gone up and we've had a
[1:31:04] rejoicing time at the wedding supper and
[1:31:06] we've been there three and a half years
[1:31:08] and tribulations poured out on the earth
[1:31:10] and remember that the the jerusalem has
[1:31:13] been trampled down by the gentiles and
[1:31:15] you remember god's desire is that we
[1:31:17] would live in jerusalem
[1:31:19] god's desire is that jerusalem would be
[1:31:20] paradise it'd be identic
[1:31:22] who knows that
[1:31:24] he doesn't want do you think god wants
[1:31:25] jerusalem to look like it does right now
[1:31:27] with a big pimple on top of where the
[1:31:29] temple was
[1:31:30] looks like you just need to really pop
[1:31:31] that thing you know and i'd oh man but i
[1:31:33] just think okay well the lord's going to
[1:31:35] have his day amen who believes the law
[1:31:37] is going to have his day and that's
[1:31:38] going to see you now you can picture
[1:31:41] jerusalem and i was walking through that
[1:31:42] old city and i was walking through and i
[1:31:44] looked at civilization after
[1:31:46] civilization and building because of war
[1:31:48] and because of darkness and because of
[1:31:50] byzantine roman catholic and then
[1:31:53] muslims and allah and moon gods and and
[1:31:56] then all this other rubbish
[1:31:59] old false religions all just building
[1:32:01] themselves these big spires in jerusalem
[1:32:03] and it's all just this big idolatrous
[1:32:06] mess
[1:32:07] and that is the heart of the earth
[1:32:10] that's the where the throne of god
[1:32:12] that's the apple of his eye that's god's
[1:32:15] desire for that is not that
[1:32:17] and you know what
[1:32:19] god if god's desire for that is not that
[1:32:21] and god's desire for that is he didn't
[1:32:24] guess what's going to happen
[1:32:25] eden
[1:32:27] so we have an inevitable reality
[1:32:29] that that torn up place and it gets
[1:32:32] worse in the tribulation it gets torn up
[1:32:33] it gets trodden down by the gentiles so
[1:32:36] they're all just going to come upon us
[1:32:38] or there's going to be a big armageddon
[1:32:39] battle it's going to be destruction and
[1:32:42] that's what it's like in your heart
[1:32:44] before he comes
[1:32:46] but yet
[1:32:48] and you know you think oh my i look like
[1:32:50] this just an average
[1:32:52] person right i look like this average
[1:32:55] why me who's ever thought that why me
[1:32:58] lord how did it be me
[1:33:00] the odds are pretty slim right
[1:33:02] that you would be in a left seed
[1:33:06] and you think why me i'm going to leave
[1:33:08] it there i'm just going to read you this
[1:33:09] and then we'll revisit that because and
[1:33:12] i want you to think why me lord
[1:33:14] and remember the scripture it says
[1:33:16] despise not the day of small thing
[1:33:19] for the you know the lord wants to do an
[1:33:21] amazing restoration to israel and change
[1:33:24] everything and you know he came down to
[1:33:26] jerusalem and what did he do you know
[1:33:28] after the supper if he reads through
[1:33:30] zechariah 14 it
[1:33:32] shows the the lord coming to jerusalem
[1:33:34] to restore it and actually it's after
[1:33:37] the marriage supper after the armageddon
[1:33:39] after the false prophet and the beast of
[1:33:40] cast into the lake of fire i hope you
[1:33:42] follow me um who's with me
[1:33:46] okay so after all those things after
[1:33:48] we've been raptured everything then we
[1:33:50] go back to the earth but you see if you
[1:33:52] read the war zone that we come to and he
[1:33:55] comes to
[1:33:56] that's terrible
[1:33:58] but he starts a work
[1:34:00] he begins to bring stabilization he
[1:34:03] takes what the see that's the fruit of
[1:34:04] the devil if you buy into the devil's
[1:34:07] lies if you start listening to his
[1:34:09] narrative and i'm talking about your
[1:34:11] narrative your flesh narrative that he
[1:34:13] begins because he uses your flesh
[1:34:15] against you he uses your old nature uses
[1:34:17] your old inheritance he uses all those
[1:34:19] memories and he uses leverage if you buy
[1:34:22] into that and then he uses all these
[1:34:23] friends and people out in the world that
[1:34:25] would pull you from god which are not
[1:34:26] really your friends because a friend
[1:34:28] will bring you closer to god a real
[1:34:29] friend because they're a friend of your
[1:34:31] soul they want the best for you
[1:34:33] eternally but you know you see all these
[1:34:35] things
[1:34:35] but god he begins to pull you and he
[1:34:38] begins to take this war zone and and
[1:34:41] it's all just terrible and torn up and
[1:34:43] everything and he and and and and he
[1:34:45] comes down to it and he begins to turn
[1:34:47] it into a beautiful paradise because if
[1:34:49] you and not instead of a tumultuous
[1:34:52] storm because if you buy into the
[1:34:53] devil's lies and you buy into his thing
[1:34:55] and you begin to listen to all that you
[1:34:57] will end up in a storm and you'll end up
[1:34:59] with your heart like jerusalem
[1:35:01] which is what it's like now but god's
[1:35:03] desire is greater than that god's desire
[1:35:05] is greater than the storm if anybody's
[1:35:08] listening on that camera god's desire is
[1:35:10] greater than the trouble you're going
[1:35:12] through
[1:35:13] god's desire is causing an inevitable
[1:35:15] destruction on your enemy glory
[1:35:19] because you see god's desire is not our
[1:35:21] simple sinful condition god's desire is
[1:35:24] not for us to be destroyed and to be
[1:35:25] trodden down to the gentiles to be
[1:35:28] trodden down by hollywood to be trodden
[1:35:30] down by some
[1:35:31] youtube star or whatever you call them
[1:35:33] now i don't even know where it is now
[1:35:36] my goodness
[1:35:37] not to be trodden down by some ideology
[1:35:39] some communists that thought some
[1:35:41] disaster
[1:35:42] some storm
[1:35:43] that's just been all like that but here
[1:35:45] comes god he has a desire for eden
[1:35:48] he's got a desire for paradise he's got
[1:35:50] a desire that you'd have a life
[1:35:51] sustainable he's got a desire that you
[1:35:54] would be
[1:35:55] free and that you wouldn't have to live
[1:35:57] under some sickness or some plague or be
[1:36:00] fearful of some vaccine or anything
[1:36:03] no fear
[1:36:04] his desire is fear not
[1:36:08] so if you if you have any fear in your
[1:36:10] life
[1:36:11] god's desire for you is freedom
[1:36:14] god's desire for you is faith and guess
[1:36:16] what he did he gave you faith
[1:36:18] if you doubt that you've got faith then
[1:36:20] you're doubting the word and it's not
[1:36:22] true just just doubt those doubts
[1:36:24] just can't that if you think oh man i'm
[1:36:26] just not i don't have much faith and
[1:36:28] when you go to pray you think and the
[1:36:29] thought comes because i know
[1:36:31] the thought comes
[1:36:32] that you don't you might know you can't
[1:36:34] believe that it's a lie
[1:36:36] do you think the syrophoenician woman
[1:36:38] who was crying after jesus you know all
[1:36:40] of those things even all mate she had to
[1:36:42] go through a gauntlet
[1:36:45] man
[1:36:46] we got it easy
[1:36:48] so you just need to you know this is the
[1:36:50] littlest desire is that that you would
[1:36:52] have faith so he gave you faith the
[1:36:54] lord's desire is that you would go in
[1:36:56] the rapture so he gives you the holy
[1:36:57] ghost the lord's desire is that you
[1:36:59] would walk in your privilege so he gave
[1:37:01] you an open book the lord's desire is
[1:37:04] that you would live in eternally so he
[1:37:06] gave you eternal life the lord's desires
[1:37:08] that you would be redeemed so he paid
[1:37:10] for you with his own blood
[1:37:11] he
[1:37:12] he searched for you
[1:37:14] he searched you out
[1:37:16] and he knew how to woo you without
[1:37:18] interfering with your free moral agency
[1:37:20] and you would make a decision
[1:37:22] to serve him hallelujah
[1:37:25] somebody's pulling man i'm trying to get
[1:37:27] to my notes here
[1:37:30] hallelujah i'm going to read this and
[1:37:31] then we're going to close
[1:37:34] brother branham says faith is not that
[1:37:36] loose
[1:37:37] it's got to be based upon some noted
[1:37:39] fact
[1:37:40] you've got to know something about what
[1:37:42] you're having faith in before you can
[1:37:44] have faith in it so we first must know
[1:37:47] how and what god's desire is
[1:37:51] what god's plan is and how to approach
[1:37:54] god by that plan
[1:37:56] and now i've just told you what god's
[1:37:58] desire is and god's plan is it's for
[1:38:00] freedom it's for righteousness it's for
[1:38:02] holiness it's for all these things and
[1:38:04] he's made all these provisions that you
[1:38:06] would fulfill that and you're on an
[1:38:07] inevitable path to victory so just let
[1:38:10] god be god in your life
[1:38:12] amen and accept that god's desire over
[1:38:15] you as of for good things amen
[1:38:18] hallelujah so let me read this this is a
[1:38:20] tongues and interpretation from the
[1:38:21] message of grace
[1:38:23] and it's been a very striking thing for
[1:38:24] me and i really believe that this is
[1:38:26] from the lord and also just as an annex
[1:38:29] to that i believe that this is not just
[1:38:31] for them in that day actually it
[1:38:32] probably wasn't even for them it's for
[1:38:34] you right now
[1:38:36] and i know i'm putting myself out there
[1:38:37] but you wait till we get to the end of
[1:38:39] this and you're going to see it
[1:38:40] definitely wasn't for them there was
[1:38:42] portions of it of course for them and
[1:38:44] proportions for brother branham because
[1:38:45] a lot of a lot of the times those
[1:38:47] tongues and interpretations were to
[1:38:48] encourage brother branham because he was
[1:38:50] going through you know like imagine the
[1:38:52] pressure he at this this individual man
[1:38:55] that was pressing up against all like
[1:38:58] global darkness
[1:38:59] was was pressing him backwards trying to
[1:39:02] couldn't because the unstoppable power
[1:39:05] of the resurrection was controlling and
[1:39:07] leading him and that angel of the lord
[1:39:08] was with him with us so ever he went the
[1:39:10] never failing presence of jesus christ
[1:39:12] fear not you know that he said and
[1:39:14] that's over you as well
[1:39:16] when you carry this message and when you
[1:39:17] begin to testify when you raise up your
[1:39:19] hands and you begin to witness god will
[1:39:21] come down and witness through you
[1:39:24] he will do the talking amen
[1:39:27] hallelujah and we're going to go into
[1:39:29] the greatest storm and it's going to be
[1:39:31] pretty hard and it's time for you to get
[1:39:34] the stabilizer in your ship and if
[1:39:36] you've got the holy ghost it's time to
[1:39:38] let that stabilizer take its place
[1:39:40] within your engine room and get
[1:39:42] activated you know like just it needs to
[1:39:43] come into preeminence you need to give
[1:39:46] him all the glory and surrender yourself
[1:39:48] so that he can live fully
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:51] he says again i have spoken to you this
[1:39:53] morning by my spirit again calling to
[1:39:55] your remembrance that i will talk to you
[1:39:58] this morning by the voice of my prophet
[1:40:00] i have given him a message this morning
[1:40:02] that might seem to be strange to him yet
[1:40:04] it has been ordained of me that your
[1:40:06] understanding might be made fruitful
[1:40:08] that you might look upon my work of
[1:40:10] righteousness that i'm working in my
[1:40:12] church this day that your hearts might
[1:40:15] be lifted up
[1:40:16] that your understanding might be made
[1:40:17] fruitful
[1:40:19] this is god's desire now you see that
[1:40:21] you might be receptive to these things
[1:40:23] that i'm going to speak to you this
[1:40:25] morning that you might become encouraged
[1:40:27] in the way that i desire you to walk in
[1:40:31] so you see now it's very important that
[1:40:33] you know what god desires you to do
[1:40:36] individually but also on a dispensation
[1:40:38] on an age level on a church level what
[1:40:41] is god's desire for chicana tabernacle
[1:40:43] amen hallelujah and we should pray god
[1:40:47] reveal your desire for this tabernacle
[1:40:49] and then when i say that i'm not talking
[1:40:51] about the building i'm talking about
[1:40:52] this family that we have of that we love
[1:40:54] each other and that we walk in unity and
[1:40:56] that there is no chisholm and that we're
[1:40:59] just of one mind and one accord and
[1:41:01] living in revival
[1:41:02] amen untouchable you know by the devil's
[1:41:05] antics and his and his and his and all
[1:41:08] of his devices that just they just go
[1:41:10] off like a water on a duck's back
[1:41:11] hallelujah the oil of the dove
[1:41:14] amen it says that that i desire you to
[1:41:17] walk in that you might lift up your
[1:41:19] voices in praise and thanksgiving to me
[1:41:22] if it causes to be of service to know
[1:41:25] that i have been here and that my spirit
[1:41:27] is in the midst of you even now
[1:41:30] look unto me the true and the living god
[1:41:32] because
[1:41:33] i'm standing in the midst this morning
[1:41:35] i'm wri and i love this this is this is
[1:41:37] where i talk about this is this is just
[1:41:39] this whole it's not just me worshiping
[1:41:42] it's god rejoicing with me
[1:41:44] and it's not just you singing and having
[1:41:46] a wonderful time who's with you
[1:41:48] hallelujah it's not just david dancing
[1:41:50] around the ark but god
[1:41:52] do you think god wasn't happy that his
[1:41:53] ark was going back to where he really
[1:41:55] wanted it to be
[1:41:56] for so many years it was stuck down the
[1:41:58] back
[1:41:59] in some place that was not even
[1:42:00] jerusalem
[1:42:02] silo
[1:42:03] tranquil silent the seventh seal sitting
[1:42:06] in silence for so many years but one day
[1:42:09] hallelujah under david's restoration
[1:42:11] when all the promises of the prophet
[1:42:13] joshua would come to pass and it pulled
[1:42:15] it all and everything began to come into
[1:42:17] its place don't you think god was
[1:42:18] rejoicing
[1:42:20] don't you think god was dancing with
[1:42:21] david around that ark what about when
[1:42:23] you begin to dance when you see the
[1:42:24] return of the seventh seal in your life

[1:43:01] spirit and got so high on god that you
[1:43:02] can't even control yourself and you go
[1:43:04] beyond the camp of your own style like
[1:43:06] david and he was rejoicing because his
[1:43:09] god in the representation of this
[1:43:11] blessing of the seventh seal
[1:43:13] he didn't call it that but the ark was
[1:43:15] coming to jerusalem it was coming to his
[1:43:18] house what about you

[1:43:25] oh my you know you see david he was so s
[1:43:28] part of god's word we just knew how to
[1:43:31] enter in that he began to just get
[1:43:32] further and deeper into god until he

[1:44:09] bring a message to bring us out of
[1:44:11] denomination dark denomination and out
[1:44:12] of creeds and dogmas

[1:44:59] wisdom and the understanding that you're
[1:45:01] going to need when the time comes of the
[1:45:03] persecution that's going to come just
[1:45:06] before i rapture my bride
[1:45:10] so if god's warning this
[1:45:12] and he's talking to a people that are
[1:45:14] going to need something we're right
[1:45:16] there
[1:45:18] he's about to rapture his bride but
[1:45:19] there's a real persecution going to come
[1:45:21] on
[1:45:22] real bad
[1:45:24] and i'm not trying to put fear on you
[1:45:26] i'm just trying to tell you it is time
[1:45:28] for you to get the holy ghost
[1:45:30] it is time for you to be serious with
[1:45:32] god and be stabilized in his spirit
[1:45:35] hallelujah it's time for you to say i
[1:45:36] receive those desires of yours lord i'm
[1:45:39] going to be part of that o lord give me
[1:45:42] my dance give me my shout give me my
[1:45:44] victory give me my praise
[1:45:46] oh my because you you see and this is
[1:45:49] why we sing before we listen to the word
[1:45:52] you know just oh my
[1:45:55] you sing
[1:45:56] first to get into his courts
[1:46:00] and then you hear the word
[1:46:02] it's real simple
[1:46:03] but a lot of the times we're singing
[1:46:04] we're not even thinking about what we're
[1:46:06] singing and we're just going through the
[1:46:07] motions
[1:46:09] and and then we hear the word and we
[1:46:11] learn something and then we go
[1:46:12] but that's not what it's all about
[1:46:14] it's more so much more
[1:46:17] you know you're coming here and you
[1:46:18] begin to sing
[1:46:20] and god gives you your praise
[1:46:22] because you said tonight
[1:46:24] you said you said lord
[1:46:26] i'm not leaving here without my praise
[1:46:29] i'm not leaving here without my dance
[1:46:31] and my victory dance
[1:46:33] it doesn't mean you're going to go
[1:46:34] dancing around this place tonight
[1:46:37] you can
[1:46:39] but what i'm talking talking about is
[1:46:41] that you lay a steak down and you say
[1:46:44] lord
[1:46:45] i'm going to be on the camp of my
[1:46:47] my my culture my inhibitions and
[1:46:50] everything
[1:46:51] i'm not going to let that
[1:46:53] hinder me from walking in my victory
[1:46:56] i'm not going to let all my memories and
[1:46:57] all these other things hinder me
[1:46:59] lord i'm laying hold of my eternal life
[1:47:03] john said give me the book
[1:47:06] he had to he had to take it
[1:47:08] it was the violent take the kingdom by
[1:47:10] force
[1:47:12] you must fight if you must reign
[1:47:14] increase my courage lord
[1:47:16] it's not just something you flop into
[1:47:19] because the devil doesn't want you to
[1:47:20] get it
[1:47:21] it's going to use everything against you
[1:47:23] to try and stop you
[1:47:24] and just as you leave this body we leave
[1:47:26] these this earth and we go on a body
[1:47:28] change he's going to do everything he

[1:53:58] wouldn't
[1:53:59] despise the day of small things lord
[1:54:01] father and we would see this as an
[1:54:03] insignificant service or we're an
[1:54:05] insignificant person or maybe this is an
[1:54:07] insignificant environment lord but
[1:54:10] father as you said to those people lord
[1:54:12] that were in the second
[1:54:14] lord temple and the half of them were
[1:54:16] crying because they knew what the great

[1:54:23] thing that they had built and it was
[1:54:24] just not even half as good didn't look
[1:54:27] very much on the outside
[1:54:28] but you see the difference was lord that
[1:54:31] the old one had an ark a symbol but this
[1:54:34] one that didn't look very good like us
[1:54:35] lord we don't look like much this church
[1:54:37] doesn't look like much it's not some
[1:54:39] great big thing
[1:54:41] but lord we're not just receiving an ark
[1:54:43] lord we're not receiving some shadow
[1:54:45] form
[1:54:46] oh god but the but that second temple
[1:54:48] was preparing for a living god
[1:54:50] a living way a new change of testament
[1:54:54] the seventh seal himself the god of
[1:54:57] glory to come to the temple the temple
[1:54:59] didn't look like much this temple
[1:55:00] doesn't look like much my behavior isn't
[1:55:02] much half as half as good as the old age
[1:55:06] old school most people
[1:55:09] father our performance we may not look
[1:55:10] like much we may not they'll be able to
[1:55:12] handle all these things and great works

[1:55:31] temple lord this is what you're building
