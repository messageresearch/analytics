[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] The God of creation
[0:09] [Music]
[0:12] there at the stop before the beginning
[0:15] of time
[0:19] [Music]
[0:22] with no point of reference.
[0:27] You spoke to the dark and fleshed out
[0:30] the wonder of life.
[0:37] And as you speak,
[0:43] 100 billion galaxies
[0:46] are born.
[0:50] In the vapor of your breath, the planets
[0:55] form.
[0:58] If the stars were made to worship, so
[1:03] will I.
[1:06] I can see your heart in everything
[1:10] you've made.
[1:12] [Music]
[1:14] Every burning star, a signal fire of
[1:19] grace.
[1:21] If creation sings your praises, so
[1:27] will I.
[1:28] You're a God of your promise.
[1:34] You don't speak in vain, no syllable
[1:37] empty or void.
[1:41] [Music]
[1:44] For once you have spoken.
[1:47] [Music]
[1:49] Oh nature in science follow the sound of
[1:53] your voice.
[1:56] [Music]
[2:00] And as you speak
[2:05] a 100 billion creatures catch your
[2:10] breath.
[2:11] [Music]
[2:13] evolving in pursuit of what you said.
[2:19] [Music]
[2:20] If it all reveals your nature, so
[2:25] will I.
[2:28] I can see your heart and everything you
[2:32] say.
[2:34] [Music]
[2:36] Every painted sky, a canvas of your
[2:41] grace.
[2:44] If creation still obeys you, so
[2:49] will I.
[2:51] If creation still obeys you, so will I.
[2:59] If the stars were made to worship, so
[3:04] will I.
[3:07] If the mountains bow and river and so
[3:12] will I.
[3:15] If the oions roar your greatness, so
[3:20] will I.
[3:23] For if everything exists to lift you
[3:27] high, so will I. If the wind goes where
[3:33] you send it, so will I.
[3:39] If the rocks cry out in silence, so will
[3:43] I.
[3:46] If the sum of all our praises still fall
[3:51] shine,
[3:54] then we'll sing again a 100 billion
[3:59] times.
[4:02] Oh, so alive.
[4:04] [Music]
[4:09] You're the God of salvation.
[4:12] [Music]
[4:14] You chase down my heart through all of
[4:18] my failure and pride
[4:25] on a hill. You created
[4:31] the light of the world abandoned in
[4:34] darkness to die.
[4:38] [Music]
[4:42] And as you speak,
[4:47] a 100 billion failures disappear.
[4:51] [Music]
[4:54] We lost your life so I could find it
[4:59] here.
[5:00] [Music]
[5:02] If you left the grave behind you, so
[5:07] will I.
[5:10] If you left the grave behind you, so
[5:15] will I.
[5:18] I can see your heart and everything
[5:22] you've done.
[5:26] Every part designed in a work of our
[5:30] core love.
[5:34] If you gladly chose surrender so alive.
[5:42] If you gladly chose surrender so
[5:47] alive.
[5:49] I can see your heart billion different
[5:54] ways.
[5:57] Every precious one. A child you came to
[6:02] save.
[6:05] If you gave your life to love them so
[6:10] I
[6:13] like you would again a h 100 billion
[6:17] times
[6:21] or what measure could amount to your
[6:25] desire.
[6:26] [Music]
[6:28] You're the one who never leaves the one
[6:33] behind.
[6:37] You're the one who never leaves the one
[6:41] behind.
[6:46] [Applause]
[6:47] Hallelujah.
