evening everyone you've got you've got your Bibles handy let's turn to the Book of Isaiah and we can also read from revelations chapter 3 it's good to have you one here tonight I sell Hosea 6 and verses 1 to 6 then we're going to read revelations chapter 3 verses 14 to 22 I'm gonna have a bit of a maybe a bit of a journey through the scriptures tonight so Hosea 6 and verses 1 to 6 sees here come amen we're not any hairy Isaiah 6 verses 1 to 6 this is come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he'll bind us up after 2 days will he revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we will live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth as prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the letter and former rain unto the earth Oh II frame what shall I do unto the Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early Jew it goeth away therefore I have hewed them by the prophets I've slain him by the words of my mouth and thy judgments as the light that goeth forth for I have desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings amen and we're just going to go to revelations chapter 3 and revelations 3 and in verses 14 to 22 we let's just read here we understand this speaks of the age the day an hour than which we live sees here and unto the Angel of the church so they do see ins write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because our sayeth I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed in it than that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I mean you may have your seats may the Lord bless the reading of his word I'd like to begin a beginner series on the lady of C in church age now there's a lot that has happened in this day an hour a lot of scripture has been fulfilled in our generation and I want to begin to go from beginning from from we understand the lady I see in church a started around 1906 with the Azusa Street revival God restoring the the gifts of the Spirit back into the church and there was a big wave of the Pentecostal movement through the earth and and this this began this space of time where God would do an incredible amount of things and we are living in the lady I see in church age we know that even after the brightest raptured the lady I see in church age will continue on because the world is in a lady of seeing condition but the bride will be taken off the earth so endless endless time there is a lot that God has fulfilled and he is fulfilling and I just want to go into these things that we would ever be I believe a better understanding where we are in the scripture and also we would have a better appreciation with with where God has taken us from and we read in Ephesians if you just want to follow me as we as we we're going to read in Ephesians chapter 1 and we're gonna read from verses 5 to 11 because Paul he speaks about maybe let's just read this I'm just gonna go but slow tonight because I'm going to basically cover a whole bunch of topics them as the Lord leads we'll go into them as maybe you know as the services progressed but I want you understand that God wants you to know where you are he doesn't want you to wander around and say maybe we're here maybe this is happening your God interprets his word by bringing it to pass just like he said he said a virgin shall conceive and that was interpreted by Mary a man being found with child which is Jesus just overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and and she was found with child that was the interpretation of their prophecy in God and many people wonder how it's going to happen God brought it to pass and that's how he showed it was going to happen so it's the same thing in all the scripture God interpreters word by bringing it to pass so we see God interpreting in his word we can see where we are and it's the important thing is when God says this is B this is what I'm doing this is the scripture on fulfilling then therefore we don't need to wonder and guess we can say god this is what you're doing because you've declared it and so he says in ephesians chapter chapter 1 we're going to read from verses 5 to 11 I just I only really want the verse 10 but I just like to read the book of Ephesians he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace her and Heath made us accepted in the beloved what a wonderful verse and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins even I mean sorry according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance having predestinated being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so he says here in verse 11 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he would gather all those in heaven and on the earth even in himself so there comes a time where we had a dispensation you could say in an Eden of you could say maybe innocence then there came a the you know the Avery you're Abraham's dispensation they came a dispensation of the law now we're living under the dispensation of grace but there comes a time when there's a dispensation of the fullness of times when everything comes to its end right and we're living in that season we're at the end of all things we're living in the dispensation of the fullness of times when God would gather all things in heaven and on earth to himself hallelujah and that's why I read there in hosea chapter 6 that there would come a time where where he he said that that he would gather his elect ones and they would live in a sight and we understand that this the prophecy in Hosea if we maybe would just turn back to it it's speaking of the Jews now there's a lot of things happen in the later CH church age maybe I'll just list them just yo just before we continue there's Israel comes back into its homeland to receive as Messiah amen that's a that's one thing that happens hell opens up and comes upon the earth revelations 9 that happens the mighty angel Christ comes down to anointest people to restore them back to sonship again amen that happens there's the people that take the gospel to the corners of the world this gospel must be preached into all nations in in the end shall come before they can happen the gospel has to be restored so therefore a ministry with the spirit of Elijah has to come to restore the people that has to happen amen Christ and his bride have to become one there's nothing that must happen in this endtime amen everything Adam lost has to be placed into man's hands again there has to happen amen the rapture has to take place amen the false vine has to be bound for the burning that has to happen the tears have to be bound for the burning that has to happen the weed has to be gathered into the garner which is Christ that has to happen I mean there's going to be a translation of the living Saints the dead in Christ have got arise that's got a happen in this in time amen you know the you know the image to the beast has to be manifested upon the earth that has to happen the mark of the beast has to be manifested upon the earth that has to happen the seal of God has to be manifested upon the earth that has to happen I mean all these things have to happen is you know and and there's more besides that but this is all in the season that we're living in Alleluia I mean there's got to be you know the son of man has to be revealed again G the minister of Jesus Christ has to repeat in the letter C in church age that has to happen they understand a lot of these things have happened I mean it's going to be a sick and crucifixion that has to happen right there's got to be a resurrection season that has to happen amen there's got to be a journey of the church from from from Egypt into their inheritance in the promised land I mean that has to happen right there's going to be a change in dispensation from a man age to an eagle age I mean that has to happen all these things have to happen in this in the season that were alive and God is fulfilling his scripture in our myths I mean a bride is going to be called she's going to be positioned at his right hand as as God said to Moses there's a place by me that has to happen where people come to their sonship amen so all these things have to happen in the end time so Hosea here we read this because it said now after two days he will revive us make us alive and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in a sight now this is speaking of the Jews this was written well in my chronological order whoever put the time in the Bible this was written BC 780 now a day in the Bible we know as a thousand years as it season Peter one day with God as a thousand yo one day with God is like a thousand years upon the earth I thought I don't get these things around the wrong way because I've a tendency to see but so this has been three days in God's time and the third day sees where he will revive us the Jews will be revived and we will live in a site and we understand from the scripture that in order for the Jews to come awakened again by the Spirit of God but they're going to be cool back to their homeland and they're living in their homeland I mean so this this now places this scripture it's already been fulfilled where people have been called and there's a real desire and the Jewish people we're more the Messiah come when will we rebuild the temple when will we remove these things be restored there's a genuine stir among them wanting this to happen and it's all happening that way because soon and very soon that's going to happen amen but before that happens that Gentile bride has taken off the sea Alleluia now let's read here and let's go to Matthew chapter 24 I'm just going to read some scriptures because and then we're going to after we read Matthew chapter 24 we're going to go to Luke 21 Jesus is answering here in Luke 24 I mean sorry Matthew 24 he is answering some questions that the the the disciples asked three questions two and he answers them so in Matthew 24 verse one it says and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and that and Jesus said under the embassy ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down speaking of the temple and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be that's one question and what shall be the sign of thy coming there's a second question and at the end of the world they they asked him three questions and then from and then from then on he begins to answer those three questions and then so one part of the end of the world the sign of his coming he he if we drop down to verse 32 he says now learn a parable of the fig tree this is putting this all in time I mean I trust you this this would stir you up a little bit we say well I've heard this many times we're gonna hear it one more time it should mean something to you if God's fulfilling his word it should mean a lot to you he says now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say to you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall not pass away I mean shall pass away sorrow but my words shall not pass away now we understand we we won't read it now but if you go read and Jeremiah chapter 24 Jeremiah sees a vision of two baskets of figs and God gives them the interpretation cuz one that he says is a basket of good figs the other one naughty evil figs that's what he uses the word not a says the good fix he says this is both the children of Israel the good figs that so they'll all be scattered they'll all be driven out of the promised land but the good folks will come back again but the evil figs will be scattered they'll never come back again and that and that's what happened there when when Nebuchadnezzar came he burned Jerusalem burned the temple did everything took them all into captivity and after seventy years some of the Jews came back but not all of them came back right so when he speaks about figs and a tree speaks of it not only a person but also a nation so since when you see a the parable of the fig tree this is an Israel becoming a nation when when you see it's putting forth its bud so it's beginning to grow again amen Israel becoming a nation again puts forth leaves you know that summer is nigh the Millennium is nigh that's why he's speaking about and Israel's being a nation for about 70 years Amen for over two and a half thousand years they haven't been a nation now they're a nation and if you go even look at the war history and the commentary on on the independence war in different ones they shouldn't have they shouldn't even be standing as a people but God wanted them there God had to have them there because there are signposts telling you we're at the and then I read that scripture that this generation this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled Jesus speak of the generation that sees Israel became a nation shall not pass until all things are fulfilled and they've been a nation seventy years they are elderly now we're are we friends we're right at the end of the end of the end of the end amen so this is now putting this in in time where Israel has been gathered but then if we go to Luke chapter 21 we're going to read another record of what Jesus just see it but we're going to see well it's just let's just read it Luke 21 and verses 20 29 down to verse 33 he says here speaking of the same thing he says but he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they shall shoot forth you see and know that your ownselves that summer is nigh is nigh at hand so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand fearless and to you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall not pass away by sorry shall heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away so he's saying it's not just not just Israel becoming coming to its fruition but all trees and you see all the nations rising up you see because it wasn't so if you go look at the time Israel becomes a nation shortly before or after that brother branham is called to take two gifts of two gifts amen a healing revival to strike the earth and ultimately the reason of his ministry is to call the bride to Jesus Christ and then also the World Council of Churches begins to race all in the same amount of time so God is calling Israel back to their homeland God is sending a messenger to find a bride for his son Jesus Christ and also the tears are starting to be bound all this in the same time everything is coming to its climax amen this is very important we know these things because if we get because you should be able to look what you see in the earth and what you see in the earth is interpreted by the scripture Amen you see you see in the Bible the world has become drunk by the wine of the wrath of the harlots fornication become drunk and and and I'll say this now this is just me you know but I watched part of the inauguration a parade of President Trump and in part of the parade they actually get out of the limo and they walk along and and all of us him and his family nothing is about you see them get out and I sawed them ourselves this world is drunk because if you take a party you just take a natural party you want to have the most fun you don't get some sober minded straight person you know who's you know can can think soundly you're not going to have him rubbing your party you're going to have a party animal run your party isn't that right you're not going to have someone who actually can think sensibly you have some crazy geiges that'd be more fun and this world is drunk this world has gone crazy brother ham says that this world is just this close to insanity and it has God and saying people are so drugged up to try and keep normal uppers down there's all kinds of things that try and stabilize their lives and you know this world has gone insane and we can see it because it's in the scripture now this world there has to be someone unstable either that side or the other side to push a button and it's going to fire some missiles and they're going to wipe out their enemy and then while those missiles are flying the other side will push their button and their missiles will wipe out the other side someone has to be not sensibly minded to do it and this is and we just look at it say well this is just how things are these days you know there were other people who were who were lined up for the Republican nomination there were people like being Ben Carson who to see day adventists you know but but he's got a good character he's got at least some kind of Christian good moral character they don't they don't want some good moral character person to be their president people aren't interested in that it used to be very important what kind of character do they have what kind of track work you're do they have they used to matter it doesn't matter anymore because the world's gone drunk the world's gone crazy now when all the trees come forth now it's also here if we if we go to let's go to Acts chapter 3 we'll read here I'm just going to touch kind of a lot of highlights though when you think about this there's so much Jesus's last few moments from the Garden of Gethsemane to Calvary so many prophecies were fulfilled just like this just like this rapidly scripture fulfilled very quickly he you know some people have in their minds oh we're we're far ways off you know it'll take ages for things to happen the world isn't really that bad the cuppy and Nick would he hasn't really wax full yet and it can just happen like this it could happen very rapidly you go look at the prophecies here's some homework students go look at the list of prophecies Jesus fulfilled in his last few moments and you'll see he feel fulfilled a lot of prophecy just in few rapidly a big amount of Scripture was fulfilled just in a few hours it can just happen like this and then we're done now another thing that must happen is there must be a restoration or a restitution of all things we read here in Acts chapter 3 we're going to read from verse 19 to 21 it's his repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began now the word restitution means a restoration so normal for there to be a restoration there has to be a losing of something right and we know from the dark ages you take from you take Peter Kostis or full the people in that you know the children of God in the your upper room 120 they are fully birth into the kingdom but then you come to about Acts chapter 15 and there's disciples that have come in and they're trying to already swing the people back to become Jews before they become Christians so there's people haven't been fully born into the kingdom they've just they've just associated themselves with the believers but they haven't become full believers here and you can see already and decline from the day of Pentecost already it gives me to decline begin to happen until the Dark Ages where the truth has been virtually totally wiped out amen you can see it in the scripture and then but then there so that had to happen because it had to be a restoration of all things and that's why if we if we go to if we go to Luke I mean so I Matthew chapter 17 we're going to read about what Jesus is Jesus says here in Matthew 17 verse 10 dunder we're gonna read revert down to verse 13 and as disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto Elias surely shall first come and restore all things so he's going to come but I signed you that Elias has come already and then you have not but if that unto him whatsoever things they listed likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist so Jesus saying he has come but he shall come it's being of two different comings of the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Elijah was seen upon the earth to turn the people to God not to turn people to himself but to turn people to God amen and you even take you even take the account and first Kings when when when there are Mount Carmel this is this is Elijah fear and he rebuilds the altar of God that had fallen down so he ruber rebuilds the correct approach to God and he places the wood and the sacrifice and as the water poured on in the praise Oh Lord that the people would know that thou art God I've done this according to thy word and you have turned their hearts back again amen and in the fire false and the people see who really is God that was the that's the purpose of his ministry that the people by a supernatural vindication would turn the people a meant back to the original faith Allu yeah I'm glad that's the case it means there has to be he shall come and restore all things we read so this had to happen in this day as well I'm glad that's true I mean in also what we have now you say well what does this really got to do with me well I'm gonna show you this is a harvest season it's a harvest and they dosia right they did in Christ are waiting for us to be gathered I mean because us without them cannot be made perfect it says in Hebrews 11 which means means complete so they're waiting for us to come to our position amen and then they will race and then our bodies will be changed it will go to meet the Lord in the air so that there's a harvest so we've been gathered to a place even right now we've been gathered to a place a mint who's heard always get his first name wrong but who's heard of brother Robert or brother Richard Milligan's testimony whose watch that California Lincoln sent it to you he was one of Billy Graham's managers I mean not not sorry not Billy Graham Benny Hinn's managers and he was zero on the platform with Benny Hinn and he saw the people that your people being pushed over and God you know the spirit doing different things and he even was partaker of that he was in one one meeting he says and Benny Hinn says I've got to go you take over and then he did it and they all fell over totally and he said I got it I got it but he found out he didn't have it and then he comes across one of his friends came into the message but he hadn't been converted yet and his friend had like a fight he picked him up and pinned him against the wall saying you've got to grow up spiritually and then so they never spoke for about seven years then he meet him again he had been changed because he was just talking about doctrine but the life had come unto Him him and his wife have been transformed by this message and then so he begin to he got the your the seven church age book and different things and he was reading in there where brother BAM says about the tears are being bound which is the World Council of Churches all the denominations are being bound and then he's about to go into this meeting which was the first International pastors meeting that they had ever had and and he comes late into a service and and a man is preaching about basically we're not looking for God to come back we just got a fight and live and everything we're not looking for Jesus Christ's return and there's thousands of pastors and they're rejoicing and they're shouting and he's thinking what is this and then his ears like go deaf so he sees the people they're sharing rejoicing but all the noise goes and then a voice speaks to him because he's asking what is this and the voice speaks and says this is what you read in the church age book by my prophet ah this is the rope that is binding the tears and you better get out of here at least you be bound as well and he ran to his car and he fled the place there's a binding you we are being gathered I want to make this personal you say this is not just an idea and a doctrine yes no will being gathered to a place and a spirit is gathering you right you're either being gathered amen to the Ghana which is Christ there's a harvest going on or you've been gathered to the burning I know it's awful strong but there's elders brother Brahim says just just just one statement oh wait I want to you know show it to you as well brother Brahim says and I think it's ashamed of him he says the spirit of rock and roll will lead them to the Battle of Armageddon and you can see it upon the earth just one statement but you can see it see a prophet can just make it behold the virgin shall conceive and it happened just one statement amen you know but you see it and B you see it manifesting upon the earth he had a vision 1933 you know Hitler would rise up and the you know World War two and different things and you know I remember watching a documentary on world war two it's just real footage from the war and and it's the Normandy landings and there's all these and and here comes the Allied fleet across the channel who seen these things and there's all these there's this big armada and thousands of men and planes in the air and planning and weapons all different things and it's all because one man said something Hitler will rise in Germany amen you know World War two is going to happen but it'll come to a mysterious in it's just a phrase but look at it manifest upon the earth it was you just take even we say well I'm not sure about that you take God telling Abraham your seed will sojourn in a strange land for hundred years but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand and then if you could have a you know aerial view of that he comes a million odd people his Moses come down into Egypt I mean let my people go the plagues fall all those things happen and then God and then God draws them out of Egypt it's just a phrase the prophecy was just a phrase but look at it happen look at the manifestation of that prophecy Alleluia I mean so there's a gathering going on this have a season that we're living in and we will be gathered we will be harvested or gathered in one place or the other hallelujah and the garner that we should be gathered to us Christ is only one Garner is one cheap fault amen so now let's read to let's go to mark chapter 4 it should I say well brother Brown told someone their address what's wrong with them where they're from and it was true and it was true and it was true and it was true I'd say what he said by other things are true also when he saw the preview of the bride you know when he saw that preview of that bride coming it saw the first age walking a robed in the righteousness of Christ robed in white walking in line and then he saw the different nationalities come forth after that he saw the modern church dancing twisting to the sound of rock and roll being led by a witch and and now the first church that came the ones who you're the real believers in the beginning they came to a place and they started walking up but this modern church was being led by which dancing the rock'n'roll started going down and then now and then he was so ashamed of himself singing it's just the best I can do he says but then but then another group came up they looked exactly like the first ones and now seeing onward Christian soldiers marching as to war and he saw them coming and then they started to walk up also but some at the end who were who were dressed like Europeans started looking at these other ones and they were getting out of step and the problem was so should I be here screaming stay in line stay in line because they so gripped by it now you take that modern Church being led by a witch dancing to rock and roll now unfortunately that is happening unfortunately we don't rejoice in these things because they're so they're also but they are going to a place but I trust we're not influenced by them because we'll get our eyes off staying in line with the walking to the beat of the gospel I want to walk up I don't want to walk down Jesus didn't die that I'd walk down he wants me to march up and desire amen so now Matthew sorry we're in mark chapter forward we mark chapter 426 and he says and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day in the seed should spring up a spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the year after that the full corn in the year but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest has come now I want you to notice now there's four stages he speaks about that brother Brown speaks about the restoration of the bride tree he talks about that the early church was the grain but then under martyrdom and under false doctrine of the the pale horse ride I mean the white horse rider riding forth I mean it was buried and in the dark ad that was underground but God said I will restore and then so Luther came forth with the just shall live by faith Alleluia and even if he take if you take church history the the messenger to to the Dark Age the theit our age was was Columba and he found in a Bible school which for the next nine hundred years was from that Bible school up in Scotland was the vast majority of the evangelical work through the Dark Ages and brother Brahim says that the at the ministry that are fix th the most is the start of the age oh I'll put this in I'll bring this out later but his ministry affected cages the most and then from him him came John Wycliff who knows Bible history he just had a burden that the Bible should be in English and then but then he was persecuted against and then he influenced us who is a hundred years before Luther and he prophesied that in a hundred years a man will stand up with the same belief and you will not destroy him and they burn us at the stake then a hundred years after HUS Luther rose up and he wasn't killed and the Reformation was born I mean so so it was buried and then now and then it brought forth weight should sleep that the siege of spring up north before the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade justification this is the restoration amen you see if he taking it take a piece of corn and you plant it in the ground when the first your green sprig go the first blade comes forth it doesn't look like the corn but it's got the life of the corn right but it's on its way but the same life that was in the corn is coming forth and as the Holy Ghost has been working through seven church ages right he's been there in the dark ages he was there in the Reformation he was doing the restoration of the gifts he was there with John Wesley he was there with Martin Luther he was there with Iranians he's there in this day as a sense and revelations chapter one he walks among the seven golden candlesticks through the seven church ages hallelujah I'm glad he's walking I'm glad he's still walking hallelujah he's walking you and me where is he he's in his children amen so first comes forth the blade and then the air what's that there so the first was the jaw shall live by faith God's restoring Martin Luther if if he saw his life you'd say well he's nothing like Pentecost but God was restoring that was the first work of grace amen and then after that was the then the ear so so John Wesley he heard the commentary that Martin Luther wrote on the book of Romans and he said his heart was warped you know these things I know read history we do not follow cunningly devised fables of men this is not cunningly devised fables this message this is God saying this is where I've been this is where I am and this is where you're coming with me because he's going to go up into the millennium but he's going to take us with a minute so I see it this is where you're coming with me but he wants you to know this is where I'd be this is where I am that gives you stability because if you know where you've been know where you are then you can say well now I know where I'm going it's like if you had a map and you say well I need to drive to I need to drive to Gisborne and you've got an old-fashioned map well first you to find out where are you on that map because if you don't know where you are you say well I've got to turn left here and you can end up in New Plymouth the opposite side of the island you got to get better you got to go back now where am I that's right and this is this is a road map this is a map God has to show you this is where you are this is your destination this is how far you've got to walk to get there but if you don't know your starting place you know you'll turn left instead of turning right we want to turn right all right okay so then now there's the plate and it is the year which is John Wesley sanctification so justified by faith and there's a sanctifying grace of Jesus Christ living a holy life amen and then after that the full ear of corn we know that in 1906 there it was small outpourings before it but then God put out a spirit on the Azusa Street mission they had a burn they want to see God restore the gifts of the Spirit and people begin to speak in tongues and prophesy and and and that spread from there all over the earth but that's not the end that's not the end right so the in the air but after that the full ear of corn that's the four stages you see Jesus speaks about the kingdom of God is like and unto this and then now that's why just an anointing of a gift now that wasn't the final restoration but after that now God would come and dwell in his people once again but he doesn't do away with anything God adds to God doesn't take away he adds like the statue of the perfect man at your faith virtue knowledge temperance all of us as EDD so so with us doubt we don't take away from being justified by faith I mean we believe in the fullest of the justified by faith you never did it in the first place you're justified you never did in God's mind when he saw you rejoicing on streets of gold redeemed that's in the first place in his mind we are merely the manifestation of his thoughts only that's why you've got to begin to think what did you think about me God because I want to think about me like you think about me because that's what matters right and then now but then we believe in the second work of grace which is sanctification but it's not us because the Methodists they had a method of living a sanctified life that's why they were called Methodists they had a method this is what you got to do but real sanctification is he comes in and he cleanses you out just like a dove a dove doesn't have to take a bath it's a special bird because the oil that's in it as excreted through its skin and keeps it clean hello heavenly doves how are you that's why there's got to be a oil in you there's going to be alive in you that produces an oil that cleans you out all the time hallelujah wherever you are there's oil coming out keeping you clean cleansing you from the world I'm glad that's true amen and then there's the restoration of the gifts we believe in the gifts hallelu we do we haven't done away with those things God adds if God adds I'm going to add I want to be in tune with him right but then now we have the full ear of corn so you see so they saw we've had now is the full ear of corn I mean after that the fully of corn the end but when the fruit is brought forth now the fruit is what was buried there has now been produced just like Jesus said when the I think as the Greeks came to him said sirs we would see Jesus you know I said to the disciples and they came and saw Jesus said now if a corn of wheat abides a lawyer doesn't die to buy his own but if it goes into the ground it comes forth brings forth much fruit that's like Jesus Christ the fullness that God here boldly was buried rose again and it wasn't just now him now but it was he brought forth much fruit started with 120 in upper room then spread forth like wildfire hallelujah amen so now we've come to a time where the same what you see in the book of Acts now is what you see today and that's why and you can stand and I want to go into it more detail but if you can understand the the Ministry of Moses and the Ministry of Joshua have been repeated again in this day the Ministry of the son of man we know we're not going to read it but well we can let's go to Luke chapter 17 this will be the last Scripture we'll read but I you know if we can just see if we can just look into the scripture and see what's happening among believers happening in the world happening you know it gives us stability because history just repeats itself history just repeats itself so what you read now let's just before I get here to myself let's read Luke 17 and moved from verse 26 he says and as it was in the days of Noah knowing Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed the son of man is Jesus Christ when he has made known again this is how the earth is going to be so the Ministry of Jesus Christ has been repeated again in this day but you have to look at now if there's been the ministry if Elijah's come then there's been the Ministry of the Son of Man then now there's been a real Pentecost we've been restored back to not back to Azusa Street Pentecost but back to the original Pentecost because the original Pentecost was God and dwelling his people the fullness filleth all in all and the gifts everything he had we have right so but if we're restored back to them then we have a book of Acts again but then it but then in a book of Acts you have as I said and I believe it's in about X 15 you have people coming among the believers who are not fully converted and they're trying to sway people back to things of a former age and then you have the Corinthian church come forth they have their problems the Galatian Church come forth they have their problems the church in Thessalonians all those different churches and everything that the that the believers faced is repeating again today you just got to go read you see the Galatians what's happen legalism came into trying to drag the people back to a former way of doing things that's happened and we know the church in Galatia wasn't just one Church as a group so the whole part of they say the message believers had been influenced the wrong way you know these things happen you see this that's been repeating it you see the Corinthian church believers fill with the spirit but they're mature not only a place everyone has a song or a you know a psalm or a word or a tongue or whatever it is it's just confusion and there's sin among them I mean they turn liberal and they didn't deal with it you see that around the Ephesian Church deep teaching but then Paul has to come and say husbands love your wives wives love your husband's they forgot about the family dynamic you see that repeating you see you know I believe it's in second Thessalonians let's just read it real quick but um or maybe no maybe it's not no it's not actually what I want but we'll read it anyway but there's one part where people are already going around preaching that the resurrection has come the resurrections come already you see that around people believe we're in the millennium and the rapture is already taking place and it's all done whilst at the resurrection that's repeated what you see in the beginning you see at the end amen now second Thessalonians now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ as the second Thessalonians 2 and 1 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that son of that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that's called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders I mean we'll just leave that there but is that people can get shaken and mind spirit trouble by different things floating around don't be troubled look into the scripture what has to come to pass I meant and so we're just going to leave it there for tonight but there's many things that are being fulfilled and I want to show you in the scripture if you honestly if we can honestly just see what the shadow is and we can see ourselves in that shadow then we won't be trouble by what you see around you and it'll give us stability in an hour walk right and so let's have we have the musicians please and that's why I say go go read because we your brother Graham says when that vine puts forth another branch they will write another book of Acts behind it and we just think of miracles and healings and wonders and all those things are here but there's also the Galatians the Ephesians the Thessalonians the Corinthians all those that was all produced in the book of Acts era right so you've got to see now people but they're all believers but they just influenced different kind of ways they meant no that's why if you can see these things we're gonna be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine because you're gonna give stability because you can actually see well this person's because men we're to judge righteous judgment that doesn't mean you condemn someone but you can see well this person is actually just the Galatian they're still a believer but they're just this way oh this person's are Corinthian they're still a believeth or this one's an Ephesian amen you know you can and then even you can see and then I want to go also through you take Saul and David that's repeated in the state brother Brahim said that the Pentecostal moved was the last of the man aged Saul was the Saul has been King head and shoulders above the rest look like a real king that's what man wanted this was man's wisdom coming forth this is what we think a king should be but God chose a David and they came a point now where we there's the Philistines and in this King Saul in US Army on one side and there's a stalemate but they know David has to come and that David was one who's mean to be the real King but then there's a war that goes on and you can see the same thing you can see the same thing from from 1965 you see it down to this day where there's been a war between a former age and the prison age but then you can take people who are walking in the light of the present age you take Edna's and Abner but the one who killed them who's walking with David but he kills her kills a believer from the from the former age and there's a time of peace you can see that happening too but we'll go into these things I'm just hitting some some highlights but but if you can see what's happening here you can see was repeating it should give you some stability I mean they'd stand can we sing um we know that song we're able to go up and take the country is that Alright can we do that one amen able to go up and take the country that's the land proc Dornan through the sea all of a giant baby there are waited not calling ever Oh God yes ha in take a day yes Dunham yet what evening say while we are more than compras anything Oh my farmer yes we are able
