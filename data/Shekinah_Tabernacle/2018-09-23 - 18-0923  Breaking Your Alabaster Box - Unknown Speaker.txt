all it's great to have everyone here Amy oh yeah I'd like to thank the skeleton crew as well I mean god bless you I mean thank you very much for holding the fort last weekend I mean we had a wonderful to be there Alana and Pedro's wedding was wonderful day so you praise the Lord that's good to be home I mean if you've got your Bibles let's turn to John chapter 11 also after service we have lunch at the hub so be wonderful for everyone here amen to John 11 and we're gonna read from here then also we're gonna read from the next chapter so John 11 verses 17 down Luis is and then when Jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave for four days already this is speaking of Lazarus now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Mary to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him for Mary was still in the house and says then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had us been here my brother had not died but I know and even now so we just dropped down to verse 21 I know but even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and life and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die leave without us she saith unto Him yea Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which should come into the world and when she had so Sid she went her way and called marry her sister secretly saying the master has come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto Him now we're just going to go to the next chapter John 12 and we're going to read the first few scriptures here from John 12 sysm and then from verse 1 in jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus which was had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sit at the table with them then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and why his feet with her here and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then saith one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and he had the bag and beer that was put there in then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my burial as' for the Lord always so for the poor always you have with you but me you have not always a malicious powerheads again in prayer gracious Father we've read your word I pray Lord you would minister what is needful for us in this season Lord to every heart may you grant it in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you all you may have your seats this morning I'd like to I'd like to speak on breaking your alabaster box now but first but the first part of this you know so I trust you have listened or watch them if you have not everyone should go to the the BCF archives and watch brother Aaron McGarry preaching on no turning back I want to begin a series if I can go into it about the son of man and and where we are in history because we're living in a monumental time and it's a time where and I'm just going to go into a part of it on but I want to expand on on these thoughts later but we have a time where a bride is being United to Christ and you have to catch what's going on in this day you know we we talk about the Ministry of brother Branham and you know many people they see healings or they see a prophet or they see maybe Creek Bible teaching but it's more than that there's a Jesus Christ has been made known and the people you've got to really become one with Jesus Christ in mistake it's the son of man look 17:30 big reveal that's Jesus being revealed making himself known that had United himself with a bride now we read here where John rather has gone to the gone to the tomb of Lazarus and here we have Mary and Martha and and they are they are sisters of of Lazarus now here comes the son of man now there's a there's a a patter not that I want to lay out here before we get to breaking alabaster box but here we have the living bride we have Mary and Martha Luther they represent the Living bride upon the earth the son of man Jesus Christ comes to them and they gather to him that the that the dead in Christ which is Lazarus comes has a resurrection so here we have the cycle of the rapture where there's a call for the bride to gather to the son of man and then once they have gathered become one with him then that causes the resurrection of the sleeping Saints so Mary we see we see Mary now her so Mary calls Martha and we saw Martha calls Mary to come to Jesus and she sees so Mary we read said to her sister secretly saying the master has come and call for thee so here was here was Martha she knew that the son of man was alive she knew the resurrection was there upon the earth because we know the resurrection is a person right jesus said I am the resurrection and the life so the resurrection is a person you must become one with that person you have to become one with the resurrection right so when she said the Masters come and call us for thee I could say she said the resurrection has come and calls for thee hallelujah so now here was the here was the bride was gathered and this produced it caused Lazarus to come from the grave now we're going to go into this later but you know future of services but this is being played out too now now this has been repeated again in these last days we are living in an hour where Luke 17 the revealing of the Son of Man as more than this thoughts and secrets of the heart spring reveal it's God putting on flesh and a people I mean that's what it is it's when his word becomes material and a people that's when Jesus Christ has been revealed again in order to unite himself with us bro and this is part of his coming to the earth this is part of a sick and coming your living out the part of the sick and coming right we'd God becomes flesh in people so the master has come and he calls for thee I mean you've got to I pray that you know by the end of the service you'd look at it the message' but differently and you'd see it it is a bridegroom call it's a call for you to become one with Jesus Christ it's not religion it's not Church it's a it's a marriage it's a union I mean where people become one with the Living Word right so the master has come he calleth for thee so she knew the resurrection was upon the earth hallelujah Jesus Christ and I and I trust that you know that as well I mean there were now in this scene there were others in the scene there were the Jews who went to comfort Mary and Martha cuz their brother was dead there the Pharisees were around and after Lazarus came alive out of the grave that some of the Jews went and told the Pharisees what happened and then they plan to kill Lazarus that had been raised from the dead and so but the thing is so so when when Jesus Christ does anything when the Son of Man is upon the earth it affects a whole different kind of people and affects the elect that he's looking for it also fixed the ones that actually hate him and want to destroy him and and everyone in between right so thing is they could not grasp what had taken place in their day they thought Jesus was just a prophet as as Jesus asked his disciples in Matthew 16 who do you say either side who do they say that I the Son of Man am and they said your Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets but he said who do you say that I am so they could see he was a prophet but seeing Jesus was a prophet it's not enough it's not enough just seeing odds of prophet it's a prophetic ministry it's something that's nice no you got to see the Messiah right they had to see they had to see Jesus and his first coming as Messiah and then they really caught it you know and so that's and that's why he asked them but who do you say that I am and the same question is put into every generations left because the Word of God is Messiah and he asks you you say this's is that a nice way of living is it a nice group of people a nice social event we go to or is it Messiah is the word Messiah or not so you have to and it's like even Nicodemus when he came to Jesus and John 3 says rabbi we know though our teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him that wasn't enough we know you're a teacher come from God it's got to be more than that right that he had to see he had to see that this was Messiah and Jesus came straight out to he said unless a man be born again you cannot see the kingdom that word that word C means to understand to comprehend I mean unless the man is born you can't even comprehend the kingdom you can't understand it it makes no sense people can try to explain it to you but it won't make sense to you it just frustrates people that are not born again but those who are truly born again they see the plan of redemption they see themselves in the plan of redemption they see who Jesus Christ is in their season Amen that's why you must be born again it's absolutely essential hallelujah so now but to the bride he is revealed as Messiah now we so I pray that this the message is more than a bunch of tapes more than sermons more than healing but it's Messiah being revealed right that's what I pray that it that it is to you now you have to have a personal meeting with him you say well what has this got to do with breaking an alabaster box you've got to know where to pour your life out to if you don't know where to give yourself you can give yourself to the world that's not going to give you eternal life you could give yourself to a church that's not going to help you put your life out for a church that won't give you eternal life you pour your life out and anoint the word that's a different thing right if you pour your life out for the word I mean then you receive what the word has for you Amen so that's what you want to do this is why it's very important you've got to know we're to pour your life out I mean you're going to know who to give the right worship to now many people think worshipping is singing and and and skillful music and powerful performances by musicians and we think that's worship now that may be a part of worship but singing isn't worship necessarily it can just be performance that's not worship nothing against those things we love the musicians we appreciate each and every one of you and the song leaders we love the singing but that's not just worship that is actually not the heart or core of worship those singing and music can be a part of worship real worship according to Scripture as when you respond to God because of the revelation of his word in your life then you can really worship Him right jesus said you must worship Him in spirit the father is seeking him to worship Him in spirit and in truth the truth has to be revealed to you right so for example when the Lord Jesus saves you then you can worship Him as your Savior say thank you and Lord you saved me now you can worship now you can praise Him because he saved you same thing when same thing when you know he heals you you can say thank you Lord you're my healer you can worship Him as your healer right when when the cross becomes more than a story - but a living reality I mean that your sin was placed upon him that he took care of your son dick I mean he settled the sink wishing forever then you can say Lord you are my Savior I have salvation through Jesus Christ you can worship Him then right but unless that is if that is just a story tear you can't worship Him in reality Holly I'm so glad we can worship Him in spirit and in truth I meant if you know so so if he's healed he you can worship him as your healer as the deliverer as a guide as your piece you can worship Him as God reveals himself then you respond and worship back to God you take it through Abraham's journey you know all the patriarchs God reveals himself to them then they build an altar in worship because they're worshiping God as after God has revealed himself but before that he's just someone else's story he's someone else's testimony but when he becomes your testimony then you can really worship Him hallelujah that's why I'm so glad he's not some idea he's reality he's here to know he's here to be known hit a walk worth he'd have a relationship with hallelujah so when God opens his word then we can worship Him in a greater way now God has opened his word to us in this day the lamb has taken the book the seals are being loosed off the book and the and that title deed of redemption is now in the hands of the bride again everything Adam lost has been placed in your possession I mean that means we can worship Him according to that I mean we can worship Him that now we have everything Adam lost is now in our position amen and when that becomes a reality to the bride you can worship God like John did in Revelations 5 he says when the when the seals came when the land took the book he said everything in heaven and in the earth underneath heard me cry glory blessings honor be to the lamb hallelujah because he began to worship Him based on what he was doing in his day hallelujah now let's just go to I want to what do we have it I want to jump to this then we're gonna jump back a bit let's read this I put this up on the cou made your maybe a bit too small he say so this is from the breech brother I'm saying is my name here I don't know I hope it is but if it is that was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption come the Lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book glory open the book tore off the seals sent it down to the earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams and shouts the holy is the hosannas the glories the manifestations in old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea heard me holla Amen blessing honor might and power be to him that liveth for ever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's John hallelujah oh he was so happy he said everything inhibit he really must have cried out didn't he everything in here but every everything beneath yours every creature everything else heard me cry amen blessings and glory and honor and wisdom and might and riches belong to him amen why when the revelation came that the Lamb the redeemer our kinsmen had come back from the throne of military 'el and it walked out there to take his position I mean so he looked beyond the curtain of time he see then John saw John hallelujah you know the four and twenty elders around the throne John was one of them amen so at one moment he was he cried because no man no one was found worthy he wept as that when when when that book was sealed there he wept because in you no man was worthy to take the book and then one of the elders hid weep not John I'm going to show you a mystery hallelujah the light of the tribe of Judah he's prevailed he's been found worthy our Lord Jesus been found worthy to take the book and he saw the Lamb stepped forth bloody wounded I mean he he prevailed the overcame he took what he bought hallelujah that book represents you you're part of redemption I mean that book represents you say he was rejoicing because there he was he leaned on Jesus bosom he saw him die he he saw him appear in a glorified form he saw that part of the redemption but he was waiting for the second part hallelujah seeking and worship him according to the first part now he's waiting for the second and then now here comes that same Lamb that he knew he takes the book and then he opens the seals and he sees his name in the book hallelujah and we say what does that got to do with me has this word gripped you there's a bridegroom cold this messages together a bride to the son of man right there you'd become one with him and if you've been gathered you've been cold it means your names on the book your name is at the book of redemption hallelujah he knows how many names aren't added they're there or they're not there hallelujah if God has gripped you hallelujah I think we should rejoice I mean I've seen I've seen my name being saw been hallelujah I've been when I saw him take the book open the seals I saw me hallelujah now I can worship Him because now I know everything that Adam lost he has purchased for me and giving it back to me now I am a title deed holder the enemy cannot hold anything against me everything's being struck off by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean the full power of the blood is now enforced on this day where people are free and neat hallelujah that's why week now we can worship Him oh you're worthy to take the book loose the seals Amen not just purchased us but claimed us redeem us take us back to where we should be Leo said John got a bit happy hallelujah and you have to understand he's a symbol in the book he's a symbol of you that means it has to be manifest that revival has to be manifested upon the earth I mean when the word came open he had a revival and it's the same thing with your life the word comes personally open to you right this goes from stories to a personal love letter and you see your Redeemer in there and you see yourself and you see what he's done for you hallelujah and you also see the devil but we don't care too much about him he's just a tool of God's hand but you can I trust this book it's more than history and stories and learning about we don't just learn about God we know him right it's just like you know you know all those who are married here you don't just know about your spouse you know I know about the Emoto stories about them and I've heard testimonies about them and that makes me love them more no you met them you've been married to them you know how their you know their heart you know how they are it's not about them you know them hallelujah and I'm glad we don't know just about Jesus just about know we've met him the the masterís come he's called for thee hallelujah trustees called you and you said you responded Here I am Lord hallelujah so now it's not oh I know about the resurrection you know Muriel Martha said we know he'll raise in the last day I know about it no no you're going to see it he'll be part of it hallelujah and that's how it should be Amen now so Marion Mathur a cold I'm feeling pretty good cuddly the butterfly's been caught by a neat and I'm heavy hallelujah Macy Mary Martha gathered to the Son of Man they were scoffers they're markers around or closer different people I mean but he he was gathering them a called Lazarus out of the grain same thing the Son of Man is upon the earth Jesus Christ his word form it's here to become one with his bride Amen that the dead in Christ will reign hallelujah say well how's that exactly scriptural jesus said we're a harvest and it's the condition of the harvest that dictates when it's going to be harvested a farmer doesn't just plant some seeds in the ground and and say well I'm going to pluck them up they're ready no he looks he observes right he cultivates he watches as he watches his crop and then when it's all ready it's time to harvest hallelujah so our life he said I have a corn of wheat unless this court of wheat falls into the ground and dies it advisor Lomond if it doesn't bring forth much right so here's that quart of wheat he sees a life in himself manifested and then he looks at you he sees a life in you probably when that life comes to a full maturity when he sees himself as a people ceases were the people that's not what you see in you it's what he sees in you it's the value he sees and use the important thing and then when he sees are they ready now the harvest is here oh so it's the life it's the life of God and a people the word living in a people dictates when they get in Christ race right it's our faith that will bring them from the grave our revelation that we have will bring them forth amen it is not them coming forth that increases our faith we take a body change oh we bring them from the grave the life of Christ and you brings them from the grave hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad I'm his workmanship what are you doing in this field I'm wheat are you gonna mature with his life of me I have to Illya their son raised there's water there's nutrients I have to do it I'm sorry that's just program DNA can be is such a wonderful thing you can't help yeah if life is in you if you're a seed from the foundation well you have to come forth you can't help it let's see my brother man talks about well you know cheap bering wolf they can't help with the wool gross what happened to you yesterday I just think grass I'm just being a sheep but the oldest wool what what happened did you plan this no I just think grass I'm a sheep the life in me pushes it out paola is the same thing with the luck with the word right this message becomes flesh in you because the life in you pushes it out you can't help but I'm glad I can't help what it is you know glory to God so now we can we can worship God hallelujah because it's no longer a symbol in the book it's a living reality Holly how are you John glory to God amen now he says in the rapture message he says these three things a shout a voice of trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now a shot Jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is the shot it's the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the living living bread just feed on the word it will produce God will anoint it if it falls into the right ground it will produce he also sees in the same message when I come forth into the message with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I come with a message if any message goes forth if it's a true message if it's the church in you and miracles of God and hangs around in that organization you know it's not of God because that thing's already been declared jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes the people and then his message that's right it has to have it has to have something that God is going to introduce divine healing as miracles like that just to catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message that's what it is what comes from and here he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him see and there's some indeed it's ordained to life some of the grain wheat fell on the ground the birds picked it up others fell among thorns and some was went on prepared ground pre-prepared ground and brought forth now as the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a trumpet voices shout and then a voice and then a trumpet I shot a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice that's the that loud voice in st. John 11 38 to 44 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead Sea is too caught up to be caught up with it now once the three things take place what is next was a trumpet a voice a shout a voice of trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which is always at the Feast of Trumpets is calling the people to a feast and that'll be to the bride supper and the lamb supper with the bride in the sky see I mean so the first thing comes forth is message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why it's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church-going coming out has to got the labor for the son to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the week will be the stalks will be burnt but the grain will be gathered to the garna see how lujah so now this is where we are this is today's news now as I see it they weren't just Miriam Arthur at the tomb of Lazarus there's all kinds of people now we read here in seeking Corinthians 4 and I'm just gonna go through a few you know I was thinking maybe another time you our brother bear and preaches to the trial I'd like to preach a sermon about you know people your actors being called to a play and you talk about the believer and the make believer and the unbeliever and he said well what's my lines what's my motivation how do I operate then you go through the description Cheryl because spirits don't die I mean they just they just uh yo did you see every generation but anyway it says seeing if we're seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness which is trickery nor handling the Word of God deceitfully which means to ensnare but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost so Paul is saying we're not walking just honestly we're not coming saying one thing and actually bringing another thing but we're but we are manifesting there's a manifestation of the truth we're not handling the word deceit flee but honestly right is not to ensnare the word liberate he's been liberated from sin there's been liberator from their first nature we've been liberated from the world there's been liberated from religion and traditionally maybe that means we've been free right so so we're not handling the word Amen not walking in trickery right not handling the word deceitfully to ensnare but Amen but by a manifestation of the truth right but if our gospel be hid its hid to them that are lost in whom he says in whom this god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not least the light of the glorious gospel I mean with who is the image of God see the word is the image of God right should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but G Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ amen so he's saying if it's hidden well it's ended him with a loss but this is not the you know the god of this world has blinded them but this is not what we're here to do we're not here to come craftily here to manifest the truth right that they would that that the light would shine upon you now season second Timothy I'm just I'm just talking about the the juice or just there the Pharisees and want to kill Jesus now Lazarus I'm just talking about them right now let's know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves so they shall be selfish covetous boasters proud blasphemers now the word blessed blessed famous it's a derivative of two words and 1 is to hinder which is actually by injury by implication by injury and it's also another word joined together which is by rumor so the blaspheme it means actually to hinder those to hinder people by rumor right so people tell us not the truth they just telling fables and stories and the purpose of it is not to free you that you can walk in truth and have a Liberty but to hinder you but the hinder your walk I mean disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent which means without self-control fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now a pleasure is something that you enjoy do you say well that's fairly obvious but it can be anything so it can be a lifestyle a hobby a job even your family things that get that you love before God well you actually you're a lover of pleasure more than lovers of God right things that take up more attention affection and time than God everything's got to be in this right place right he sees having a form of godliness and that word godless means a piety devotedness so people can be developed they can have some party they can have some comer so some kind of religion having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof denying the word thereof they can actually transform oh that doesn't really happen anymore that didn't really happen that's denying the power of the word right from such turn away for of this sort they creep into houses and lead captive silly woman laden with sins lead away with diverse lusts that word lust means longing many different kind of longings they creep into houses how do people creep into houses lead people away captive internet social media creepin tell them stories that aren't true lead them away captive don't free them I'm just talking about the Jews and the Pharisees because remember the everyone's there in the scene right and so now ever learning and and and this is really why I want to put this in ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now that word knowledge means a recognition a folders discernment and acknowledgement of the truth so they will be ever learning knowing about God but they will never come to a full recognition or a full discernment of what he's doing in this day an hour right never coming to knowledge of the truth so they will not fully recognize what has happened just like those Jews who are around there with Jesus well he's a he's a prophet he served men he's a teacher come from God no that's not enough he's Messiah it's a full recognition that he is Messiah amen he says now now as jettisoned generous withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as this also was now generous and generous were the magicians in Egypt they did Moses did a miracle they did a miracle Moses did a miracle they do the miracle come to a point where they couldn't replicate what Moses did but they were but the purpose of them being it was to harden Pharaoh's heart saying well you think you're so especially you think you're God's real my God's can do the same thing and it was to hinder of people leaving Egypt to go to the promised land and it's a very purpose people rise up against the truth and the and the reason they'll that spirit in them anoints them to stop people walking free from actually leaving Egypt the world and becoming one with the son of man Jesus Christ so those people are there now you say well now I'm going to go another way we're just going to do a bit of a slalom race but we're going to get to the end about an alabaster box ok now we're going to read this this is from Genesis 4 and I just and so we know the story we're just going to skip through it Adam knew his wife she conceived Nabire Cain said I've gotten a man from the Lord and she also a bear again his brother Abel Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord so now they're going to worship and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire now shall rule over him and Cain talked with his brother Abel and it came to pass when they are in the field that Cain rose up against his brother Abel and slew him now Genesis we know as is the seed chapter so everything you see now which is fully grown or at maturity it was a seed back then so you see it in its infant fulmen and Genesis may see it fully grown now I just want to review this very quickly because Abel and his offering is the same as the alabaster box and will M will come into that but Cain now Cain and Abel they both worship they both are worshiping God they're both believers in God but Cain offers fruit now I just want to say oh well I'll just go through it and I'll get to my conclusion so Cain offered fruit which is outwardly more pleasant so let's just go back there we have two altars we have two boys worshiping the same God one brings fruit what has a very pretty altar you can make fruit very pretty you know fruit and leaves them that can look very nice and then another one brings a lamb now I guess most of us are townies yeah who's who's actually seen a lamb be killed who seen yeah who seen a you know throat slit all the guts gutted you know who's seen that now what is what is more pleasing to the eye some fruit or a lamb being kicked to death and the smell of death coming and it's blood running out what's more pleasing you say well fruit would be far more pleasant right because there's no death with fruit there's no life being released right so it looks it looks a lot more pleasant and then not only that you know because we have knives that are sharp I trust you've used a sharp knife but Abel didn't have metal he only had stone so he was with that brother by c/d Hector heck the nick of that lamb with a with a sharp stone to try and cut its throat now people today would say that's offensive that's disgusting that is horrible that is not fair on the animal right that's what they'd say they would be repulsed by such worship they would say it's wrong but they'd say with cane let's say no that's lovely that's wonderful we can put that on Instagram and it isn't this lovely you can't put a landing heck together on Instagram some content may offend they'll put a thing over it like they do on Facebook right because the world doesn't want their kind of worship but able but you see and it's the same thing today this is you know because man hasn't changed see we would call the lamb being killed as being inhumane unreasonable messy gruesome some would say repulsive but not to God God was pleased with the sacrifice and why is that because Abel was now living out the revelation the faith that God had put in him right so now him offering the lamb God put that into his heart you've got to give a lamb it's going to be lambs blood given I mean for you and so he lived out that revelation right said he didn't care what others would think he says I'm going to give a lamb it may not look pretty and may not look wonderful but hey this thing's gonna die in my place and that's how it is today society wants a worship that's more acceptable not too different from what culture Caesar agrees with they want something that is not offensive something that does not clash with their ideals or opinions that's what society wants today but with God it's not that way right you can't we can't worship God according to what other what humanly we think is right amen you can't break your alabaster box you know Judah said this is a waste he didn't see the value in it amen it may be many people it's the able hacking a lamb you know with a with a stone to kill it you think that's a waste that's unreasonable now our life is a worship to God and it shows what kind of sacrifice you have if it's the fruits of man's ideas and thinking or the revelation of the word of god me but like member worship I said it's not just singing and saying Hosanna and raising our hands and having a an emotional time it's a life lift it's based on the revelation God puts in your heart then you worship Him according to their so our life every day we are worshiping something people people give their lives for sport they're worshiping sport I know this is very obvious but I'm going to bring it down people worship a job people worship a lifestyle people worship money they worship women whatever it may be and their whole life is showing a worship to that thing right and it's the same thing with the with the believer I mean our whole life is a worship to Jesus Christ so how we treat our families how we treat one another even how you treat yourself I mean because the devil likes us well it tries to make us think we are not important we are not worthy we're not God isn't interested in us we just a number we just a bunch of DNA running around that's why he tries to devalue us I mean but you've got to say God has placed the highest value on you you're important so how do you how do you feel yourself you say well that would make you proud know if you know that he his life's blood for you as a ransom hallelujah when you know that you're highly valued but the response of that is Lord I'm so thankful I'm so thankful you redeem me I'm so thankful you gave your life for me on my heart you know you know you're on my behalf that you care about me that you love me amen so our lives that we live are gonna be what we were really worshiping what we're really producing are we print are we actually giving me you know man's ideas you know it's like brother brems says real simply the word Lord never came to a theologian he never came to a Bible School God always operated outside of those things and the ones that maybe he he he called in those places they left the Apostle Paul didn't stay it as a Pharisee he left right so but if we take those ideas in then now we're producing fruit we're actually worshiping by fruit of men man's ideas not by the revelation of the Word of God people today do not want a life of holiness separated unto God they call it offensive right our lives we live actually offend many people they don't like it it's repulsive it's it's it's unreasonable just like Abel killing a lamb it's unreasonable why would you do this why would you live this way you know but to those that have the revelation but to those that see it in the scripture and those that really love God it is not it is not a offensive thing but it's a joy it's glorious it's a wonderful thing although I can live according to your word I mean not that I would earn anything but because I love you and I want to worship you on a living life that is out of response of your redemption or it's a glorious thing right so we have to you know it's all depends what's been revealed to us that's why it's going to be more than man's argument I don't want to be a Salesman because someone else will sell you a better product right well you'll think is a better product but if it's revealed to you then it's different no man can talk you out of it amen so it's so it's how we want to live a life Abel's Abel's sacrifice was offensive now Christendom today does not find it offensive of the idea that Jesus Christ is the savior of the world that's not offensive to them that he is Messiah they're smoke that's not offensive he's Redeemer he died on the cross to take away your sins that doesn't offend any Christian just like if you talk to the Jews before Jesus was there about Messiah they wouldn't find that offensive but it was how he manifested himself that was the offensive thing right when Jesus came and and he did a lot of things on the Sabbath to aggravate them amen He healed a man who was bedridden on the sabbath see take up your bed and walk then the pharisees found fault in those things he was merely doing those things to really show what's in them and they offended because they hold on to their traditions while they rejoiced messiahs here right so now those things but it's how he manifests himself that's what's offensive so before Cain and Abel worshiped there was no offense that God needs a requires sacrifice right but then when Abel acted on the revelation God gave you it became offensive to Cain and so as soon as now as soon as Abel slit the throat of that lamb and it bled to death I'll say this Abel could not put the lamb back together you may say that's very obvious the Lambs did on the altar it's its blood as being poured out he can't put it back he can't bring that land back to life he can't get that blood scoop it up and put it back and heal up the wound and put the life back in the lamp no his whole sacrifice was a life given right it wasn't something that was held back I'll just I'll just Nick it on the on the arm and squeeze some drops out why are you saying that you can't give part of yourself right if you really give it true sacra if you really give your life to present your body and living sacrifice not just the parts that are convenient or whatever you're going to give you in time being just right lad because that lamb remember that was Abel's offering I give you a whole life I give you a whole and not just part not just Sundays and Wednesdays Irwin every day every part of my day every part of my life everything that I am I pour it out and when he gave that lamb he couldn't take it back he couldn't say well I changed my mind now god I actually liked that lamb was my price lamb now he gave it and he couldn't take it back that is true worship that is a true offering when he gives us whole life right he couldn't take it back Cain could take it back his fruit was the Ergo just take it and eat it later I'll just put this back in the fridge or the Fiji drew my fridge and I'll have it later the lamb was dead it couldn't come back to life we can't keep you can't give part of yourself this way people struggle so much they get wounded they get convicted but they don't really fully act on that conviction they don't fully give themselves I mean they just try and you know find a find some wriggle room where they can wriggle out no you got to pour your whole life out hallelujah and that is the same so the life of the lamb was fully poured out and I'll say that is exactly the same as the broken alabaster box all right you think about this is Alaba you know this two times Jesus is anointed with an alabaster box one is a prostitute she's not invited to thee to the Pharisees house where Jesus is invited but something in her move so I have to I just I just want to run this home I want you to really think about this she wasn't invited to the feast she wasn't called there at all but something in who said I must anoint this man Street he's more than a prophet there's something and I'm liking duty talking gift forgiveness of sense and she gave she took all of her money that she got through a prostitution and she went and she went into the apothecary whatever it was she didn't care I need your best give me that off the top shelf not just a little offering to make myself feel better we don't want to have religion just try and cover up our conscience and make things better you're gonna give it all you got to surrender at all and you won't be happy until you do you won't be truly at peace until you do why why fight the devil you know what's good yo you know sometimes you just gonna get sick of fighting because really you just warring against God stop fighting God what's the point of fighting God I'd rather be on his side he wins in the back here the last chapter of the book he wins right anyone who's on his side wins I'd rather be on the winner's side you know why would he fight you ought to be on the losing side people aren't willing to they just want to give a little bit but she didn't just get I'll just get that little sample there and then I'll go and sprinkle it on his feet I want the best and then she took that she somehow snuck into the face she wasn't invited this is worship this is really giving yourself Emma she so she takes it she goes straight to his feet hallelujah she didn't ask him for permission she just broke it broke the alabaster box the oil hallelujah we don't love her feet the daughter would filled the house hallelujah she couldn't put me she couldn't put the ointment back the box was broken the offering was given her life was poured out everything she had needed was was taught through that offering and she took a took her here and she washed his feet with his tears hallelujah she couldn't put it back and these others they say young you're the Pharisee that actually invited him see if this man really was a prophet he would Jesus sinner doesn't he know all things oh yeah and she that whole thing was arranged that she would come and find salvation hallelujah doesn't matter what the world's doing this world is actually engineered that you would find God God can find you in this place holy that's why many of us have moved across the world or our parents have moved across the world for the season that you had meet the son of man hallelujah that whole feast was arranged for her and she gave it she couldn't take a back seat so I changed my mind mr. G's of Nazareth I feel a bit silly no she poured it out she didn't care what others were doing and that's the thing they're precious of the devil hallelujah some pressure just all conformed don't say anything we're not a bunch of tombstones we're a bunch of living stones living people of living praise hallelujah amen and so and what a chi gong her sins were forgiven her Simon was still in his condition didn't do him any good but she poured it out she poured out that alabaster box we have to have a life that's given hallelujah don't just hold it back well this and this and this you know I've come to the conclusion Jesus has never done anything bad to me people made you a lot of bad things Jesus is that nothing bad this message is our nothing bad to me it's only done good I was lost and I'm done lost in the world floating down the destruction way then he called me and gave me life he's only done good to me he Brook complexes gave me peace of mind peace of heart polio sin was washed away there's nothing bad with that it's all good you mean there's no strings attached to this deal it must be gone oh right because what man there's always strings attached but never done anything bad to me so why should we you know we should be so grouped well what about all these people or what about those people in those than there whatever more no he should what's impacted you the most in your life it should be his word should be his word his Redemption so corrupt you but Paul the Apostle Paul he was here on the road to Damascus they'd never left them in spite of everything that came in false brethren Kaman shipwrecked stoned whatever whatever whatever he said none of these things move me I'm walking with God I'm not disobedient to the heavenly vision holy he didn't just go to the road to Damascus meet God go up an ivory tower I've seen some letters out and sit there no he had a rugged way he said to Timothy it's getting cold or Titus it's getting cold bring my coat he's in prison he didn't have a flowery bed of easy see if this doesn't move me I'm not worried about these things you're reflected and beaten whatever it does it hasn't separated me from the love of God in Christ holy he is persuaded cuz he experienced it hallelujah that's why we should just you know I was thinking about it this week so so Judas goes to betray Jesus you don't see Jesus off that saying now I wonder what Jesus is saying I wonder what he's doing and what's going on no he just continued the road he is cool to walk down right shouldn't we do the same you can take this whole world give me Jesus I'm not worried all but Russia's here and this is happening in the world in this country whatever they'll do what they call to do they have their calling what about your calling what about what your call to fulfill the word your call to fulfill you should be focused on that pal lujah and then we come to our opening next where he was anointed it was anointed let's go back to the beginning with another Ella Bester box in John 12 and this was done for his burial she anointed him she couldn't take this back costly pointment pound of it she couldn't take this back she anointed the word coz the wood things were changing now into a different dispensation so she is now anointing the wood because things had changed we no longer it wasn't a big healing campaign anymore it was now coming he was being anointed for his burial amen we're here not for a burial the word is not here for a burial right it's been crucified sure but it doesn't stay crucified the word doesn't stay crucified doesn't stay in a grave doesn't say just the world can explain away whatever amen no it's here for a resurrection hallelujah he wouldn't stay in the grave he couldn't stay in the grave it couldn't hold them the Roman guards couldn't stop him scribes and Pharisees and the naysayers couldn't stop him he just moved on through hallelujah for this cause I've come into the world and he says he says you know destroy this temple and I'll raise it up again in three days never destroy means loose loose this temple loose me from this temple I want to dwell with my children I want to redeem them I wouldn't walk in my disciples loosed me from it you're gonna do me a service hallelujah and it's the same thing friends the mockers and the scoffers and the whatever is they do your service whether you like it or not they're doing yeah you know I just I just marvel who calls the resurrection who cause the greatest week brother Brown calls of history who caused it was it the Pharisees they wanted to but they didn't it wasn't Jesus he comes Judas he you know you think his um here Satan and he's having a debrief whatever after the resurrection he's angry at his demons who course this who allowed this to happen and then their course they all pass the buck and the buck ends at Judas Judas Judas is fault because he seemed out this is we can take him and betray him and you're the betrayer cause the resurrection right he calls the crucifixion he did it he did Jesus a service he did the disciples of service he did your service hallelujah because without that betrayal there'd be no Calvary and no Calvary there's no forgiveness of sense and no forgiveness since is no God dwelling at a people and if there's none of that there's no rapture hallelujah it's all things work together for good does it love God they called according to his purpose amen so now you sorry it's all good amen it's all good our walk is all good we're on them straight and narrow way how their gods the resurrection has come many call us for thee hallelujah amen that's some we have the musicians please we're just gonna stop there but don't don't fret don't worry don't be disheartened say thank you Lord we're in a different season but I want to finish with the question of the alabaster box and with Abel what about you are you just gonna give a little bit that you can take it back or you're just gonna give your whole self that you can take your offering back you can't reverse what you've done it's been done I poured my life out that's it I want to ask you that question because if you have it's a glorious thing if you haven't why delay why delay at the end of the day you're either in or you're out oh I can deal God can deal but you're either in or out why just give it all why not give it all and then year and then you like yo I was 21 I thought why didn't I do this years ago Lord why didn't I meet you years ago would have been so much better years ago and I think everyone would have that same same testimony why didn't we do this years ago Lord why did I fight you for so long why did I wrestle why don't I whatever what nice come and break the box come to your feet and anoint you holier do your service Poli put my life out of a man wash you wash your feet with my tears do your service with no one else makes him welcome she was the only one that made him welcome in
