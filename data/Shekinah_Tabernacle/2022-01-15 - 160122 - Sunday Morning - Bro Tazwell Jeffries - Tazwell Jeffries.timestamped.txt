[1:00:46] sometimes we try to
[1:00:48] process

[1:00:52] we're seeing but
[1:00:53] we just know that it is jesus christ
[1:00:57] you are reflecting him
[1:01:00] we see it
[1:01:02] in the things that you do
[1:01:05] and there are things i
[1:01:07] i wish i could just speak out but there
[1:01:09] are certain things that that we've
[1:01:11] experienced
[1:01:13] man it just
[1:01:15] makes us so emotional
[1:01:17] but we just want to say thank you and
[1:01:19] i want to say thank you to the milam's
[1:01:21] just for opening up their door to us and
[1:01:24] the strawberries they're not here and

[1:01:29] the grain family the woodley family the
[1:01:33] all of you the brother paul and your
[1:01:36] family and you know you guys are just so
[1:01:38] so wonderful
[1:01:40] i don't like cool names out but you know
[1:01:42] it's just so so great
[1:01:45] actually when it's just before i go into
[1:01:46] the word i want to give a testimony
[1:01:50] if you you know if you're someone here
[1:01:52] maybe that
[1:01:53] thinks
[1:01:54] that the lord doesn't really
[1:01:56] or you you doubt or you question
[1:01:59] whether god is aware of you
[1:02:02] i want you to know that he knows about
[1:02:04] you
[1:02:06] he knows what you need
[1:02:09] um the last time when we came down to
[1:02:11] london to london
[1:02:14] why was it london
[1:02:17] sorry
[1:02:18] last time we came down to wellington
[1:02:21] um
[1:02:24] you know we are just transparent them
[1:02:26] open so
[1:02:27] um we came down to to wellington and um
[1:02:32] we went but the financial struggles
[1:02:35] it was a bit tough
[1:02:37] um
[1:02:38] my car wasn't working right and we
[1:02:40] couldn't come down with the car
[1:02:44] and then the lord
[1:02:46] sent someone into my home
[1:02:49] a friend that lives down the road by us
[1:02:52] and we got to talking
[1:02:54] and he said tess you're going to
[1:02:56] wellington i said yeah he said you know
[1:02:58] what
[1:02:59] take my bmw
[1:03:01] it's yours
[1:03:03] i'll fill it up with petrol
[1:03:05] and you go
[1:03:08] i don't like using people's calls
[1:03:10] but there was a need
[1:03:13] and i i seen that this was god
[1:03:16] so he gave us the car
[1:03:19] and we came down
[1:03:21] to wellington
[1:03:24] and then we had enough petrol
[1:03:26] sort of to take us home
[1:03:32] i won't mention names but we got invited
[1:03:34] out
[1:03:36] for for dinner
[1:03:38] and then
[1:03:40] after dinner
[1:03:42] the brother tells me about the des um
[1:03:44] would you mind just taking me somewhere
[1:03:48] so i found it kind of strange why was i
[1:03:50] telling you um
[1:03:52] i don't know the area i'll prefer
[1:03:54] driving with you
[1:03:55] but the brother said you know let's can
[1:03:57] you just take me somewhere so now we're
[1:03:58] in the car we fellowshipping and we're
[1:03:59] talking and
[1:04:02] and then the brothers should turn their
[1:04:03] turn they turn then i'm not taking note
[1:04:05] of what's happening and all of a sudden
[1:04:07] i find myself pulling up at the petrol
[1:04:09] station
[1:04:11] so i thought the brother wanted to buy
[1:04:12] something at the petrol at the
[1:04:14] shop and he says can you stop here by
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] gas station he had no idea about my
[1:04:19] situation he had no idea what we were
[1:04:21] facing at that time
[1:04:24] and then the brother filled up
[1:04:27] our vehicle with petrol
[1:04:31] and
[1:04:33] that got us home
[1:04:36] and when i when i when i thought about
[1:04:38] that
[1:04:39] i said lord
[1:04:41] you know
[1:04:43] you know us you know our lives
[1:04:46] you love us
[1:04:49] and the next person might not know what
[1:04:52] you facing but god just comes by the
[1:04:54] andy and he lays that person on your
[1:04:58] heart and so i would encourage you i
[1:05:00] mean i speak to myself as well when the
[1:05:02] lord lays someone on my heart
[1:05:05] do it amen because we don't know what
[1:05:07] the next person
[1:05:09] might be going through
[1:05:11] so i just want you to know
[1:05:14] we see jesus
[1:05:16] that's what we see
[1:05:19] and just continue to love him
[1:05:23] serve him
[1:05:24] you're an awesome bunch
[1:05:26] really you are
[1:05:29] okay i want i won't go further but
[1:05:32] i just want to say thank you
[1:05:34] thank you so much
[1:05:37] on wednesday
[1:05:40] even
[1:05:41] you know the lord the lord is just so
[1:05:43] wonderful
[1:05:47] you know certain things happened on
[1:05:48] wednesday in the meeting
[1:05:52] and
[1:05:55] the lord just just
[1:05:57] whatever i'm going to be saying today
[1:05:59] this is just the lord just
[1:06:01] impressed these things on my heart just
[1:06:04] to
[1:06:05] you know i want to be free by the being
[1:06:06] says be free so
[1:06:08] i just want to be free and i want god
[1:06:11] just to flow
[1:06:14] um
[1:06:15] you know on on wednesday you know
[1:06:18] the lord just laid something in my heart
[1:06:20] we spoke it
[1:06:22] and uh
[1:06:24] the lord
[1:06:25] dealt with individuals whether we you
[1:06:27] know you know see to whether we came out
[1:06:30] the lord really
[1:06:32] he touched our hearts and he he spoke to
[1:06:35] us and and you know it's so important
[1:06:38] that we respond
[1:06:40] to him
[1:06:41] because he's calling us up higher
[1:06:45] he wants us to grow he wants us you know
[1:06:48] there are things in our lives you know
[1:06:50] we know as human beings there are things
[1:06:52] in our lives that happens and
[1:06:54] and he wants us to just to let go and to
[1:06:57] let god and he uses his word
[1:07:01] to speak to us and you know
[1:07:04] on on wednesday
[1:07:06] you know as the burden was released and
[1:07:08] you know as we we dealt with with
[1:07:10] various
[1:07:11] situations
[1:07:13] um
[1:07:15] i i was so
[1:07:16] i was so
[1:07:18] um
[1:07:19] thankful
[1:07:21] to almighty god because
[1:07:23] you know it's so important that that the
[1:07:25] number one we respond to the word and
[1:07:28] that we are just honest
[1:07:30] honest with god
[1:07:32] and i actually came across this quote
[1:07:34] where brother branham actually says and
[1:07:36] i want to read this as an encouragement
[1:07:39] you know to those
[1:07:40] that um i mean when i say respond to the
[1:07:43] word i don't mean
[1:07:45] always coming up here for pray and i i
[1:07:49] love that and i i fully support that and
[1:07:52] but but many times even on the live
[1:07:54] stream you you find people they're
[1:07:56] sitting there and they're responding to
[1:07:58] the word they say lord i need you
[1:08:02] or maybe the word comes and says you got
[1:08:04] to make things right and whether they
[1:08:06] are wherever they are in live stream
[1:08:08] they would make things right they're
[1:08:09] responding to the word
[1:08:11] and brother brandon actually he says
[1:08:13] here in jesus christ the same
[1:08:15] yesterday today and forever he says
[1:08:18] you just have to get a little start
[1:08:23] meaning you start
[1:08:26] he says get your faith
[1:08:28] moving one time
[1:08:30] and god
[1:08:32] will do the rest of it
[1:08:36] and then he says if you can just
[1:08:39] get started
[1:08:41] so whether it means taking a physical
[1:08:44] step
[1:08:45] to the front
[1:08:47] and saying brother ben whoever please
[1:08:50] can you pray with me this is the
[1:08:52] situation i've got this problem i've got
[1:08:55] this struggle
[1:08:56] you taking that step
[1:08:59] take the first step
[1:09:01] once you've taken that step it's a step
[1:09:04] of faith
[1:09:06] and then god
[1:09:08] will take it and he will then help you
[1:09:10] because he's seeing that there's a
[1:09:12] honest desire
[1:09:14] in your heart
[1:09:16] to want to do right to love for him
[1:09:19] because you see that i believe the
[1:09:21] objective whenever the ministry comes
[1:09:23] and they and and they ministering
[1:09:26] to us
[1:09:29] the the the objective i believe even
[1:09:31] today the objective is to connect man
[1:09:36] to god
[1:09:37] it's you know it's it's it's it's
[1:09:39] fantastic even you know i and i i
[1:09:41] encourage my kids as well you know they
[1:09:44] they would come to me and say dad you
[1:09:45] know can you pray for me and i do that
[1:09:48] with all of my heart i i love doing it
[1:09:52] but i also encourage them and i say you
[1:09:54] know what
[1:09:55] you have direct access
[1:09:58] to the great king of kings to the lord
[1:10:00] of lords and and he he wants you to
[1:10:04] speak to him you it's so important that
[1:10:06] we speak amen
[1:10:09] so
[1:10:10] this is brother brandon actually says he
[1:10:12] says
[1:10:12] you know in the regime of the church i
[1:10:14] just talks about his desire
[1:10:16] and he says the one thing that he
[1:10:18] desires to see
[1:10:19] established
[1:10:21] is a true
[1:10:22] spiritual relationship between god
[1:10:27] and men
[1:10:29] where men become new creations in christ
[1:10:31] filled with his spirit and live
[1:10:34] according to his word
[1:10:37] amen so as you know the ministry comes
[1:10:40] and as we speak and
[1:10:41] whatever what whatever the lord has laid
[1:10:43] on my heart this morning
[1:10:44] you know the objective is just to for
[1:10:47] you just to to to build up that stronger
[1:10:50] relationship
[1:10:52] with our lord jesus christ
[1:10:57] so my title this morning by the end i've
[1:10:59] left it the same
[1:11:02] um
[1:11:03] it's
[1:11:05] it's a burden that's been in my heart
[1:11:06] and
[1:11:07] i've i think i use the title one time in
[1:11:09] another assembly not rfpf but i want to
[1:11:12] use it here this morning
[1:11:14] and the title is simply
[1:11:17] shalom
[1:11:19] to the elect
[1:11:21] lady
[1:11:23] that's the title this morning shalom
[1:11:28] to you the elect
[1:11:31] lady
[1:11:34] the lord laid on my heart to
[1:11:37] to to to encourage
[1:11:40] his people
[1:11:43] so
[1:11:44] pray for me as we just go through it and
[1:11:46] i'm lately i've noticed i like to
[1:11:49] to glide
[1:11:51] over the quotations of brother branham
[1:11:52] because it's just so awesome you know
[1:11:54] the things that that that we read and
[1:11:57] and i take a lot of these things and i i
[1:11:59] apply it to my personal life
[1:12:01] so in the message shalom so so some
[1:12:05] most of my inspiration really uh it
[1:12:07] comes from the
[1:12:09] the the shalom message and
[1:12:11] invisible union of the bride
[1:12:14] so brother branham says now my text for
[1:12:16] this morning
[1:12:18] it's an odd word
[1:12:20] and he says it is
[1:12:23] shalom
[1:12:25] he says shalom in hebrew
[1:12:28] means
[1:12:30] peace
[1:12:32] so when you say shalom
[1:12:35] you are saying
[1:12:36] peace so he says
[1:12:38] and that's what i say
[1:12:40] to the church this morning amen
[1:12:43] shalom
[1:12:44] amen and that's what i am saying to
[1:12:47] shekinah tabernacle this morning
[1:12:51] shalom
[1:12:54] he says in finnish
[1:12:56] it's called yuman rahao
[1:12:58] which means god's
[1:13:01] peace
[1:13:02] upon you
[1:13:05] now brother teaches us he says
[1:13:08] as we receive the word
[1:13:11] we become the word
[1:13:14] we know those we know those quotes
[1:13:16] and you know i grew up knowing the
[1:13:19] quotes but not putting it into practice
[1:13:21] not really seeing it in my life but as
[1:13:24] he matured me
[1:13:26] i started brother andy seeing
[1:13:28] these things in my life and as i am
[1:13:31] receiving the word i am seeing
[1:13:34] a change in my life
[1:13:37] now i say to the church
[1:13:40] shalom
[1:13:43] god's
[1:13:44] peace
[1:13:48] good
[1:13:49] morning
[1:13:52] it's a good
[1:13:53] morning
[1:13:55] we might be facing many things in life
[1:13:59] but it's a good
[1:14:02] morning
[1:14:04] god be with you
[1:14:08] receive that this morning
[1:14:12] god's peace
[1:14:14] go with you
[1:14:19] it's darkness all around us and we know
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:24] but
[1:14:25] it's a good
[1:14:27] morning amen
[1:14:29] it's a good
[1:14:32] morning amen
[1:14:33] to you
[1:14:36] christ is
[1:14:38] appearing amongst us
[1:14:40] we see it
[1:14:42] it's no longer just
[1:14:45] letter
[1:14:47] in a bible
[1:14:50] but we are seeing it
[1:14:52] in our homes
[1:14:54] we are seeing it in the church
[1:14:56] we are seeing it when we at work we are
[1:15:00] seeing it when we at uni we are seeing
[1:15:02] it in our lives
[1:15:06] so
[1:15:08] shalom
[1:15:11] peace
[1:15:13] i speak unto you
[1:15:16] in the in the in the hebrew in the
[1:15:18] lexicon
[1:15:20] that word shalom
[1:15:24] it's it's it's it's connected with
[1:15:27] a feeling of of peace we know
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:33] it's connected with a feeling of
[1:15:36] safety and as human beings you know that
[1:15:39] we we want to be safe
[1:15:43] we don't like to be in danger of stuff
[1:15:47] we want to be safe
[1:15:51] so when people use that word shalom and
[1:15:54] this is something under the hebrew
[1:15:56] lexicon
[1:15:58] it's related to safety
[1:16:01] it's related to health
[1:16:04] we want to have good
[1:16:06] health
[1:16:09] it's related to peace
[1:16:12] when we think of that word peace
[1:16:16] it just brings a good feeling
[1:16:20] we think the word peace
[1:16:23] it speaks of tranquility
[1:16:26] nothing on tranquility i'm thinking of
[1:16:28] sitting
[1:16:29] by the lake just
[1:16:32] watching the water just ripple
[1:16:36] contentment
[1:16:40] peace
[1:16:43] friendship
[1:16:46] that's what we see
[1:16:50] that makes me emotional at times
[1:16:55] to to be disappears
[1:16:59] of your friendship
[1:17:03] our relationship with god
[1:17:08] he's the peace
[1:17:10] that
[1:17:11] passes all understanding
[1:17:17] shalom
[1:17:21] walk away today
[1:17:23] saying i received
[1:17:27] peace
[1:17:29] in the greek peace
[1:17:32] tranquility
[1:17:35] exemption from rage and havoc of war
[1:17:39] peace
[1:17:40] between individuals
[1:17:43] security safety
[1:17:49] and prosperity
[1:17:53] brother branham says
[1:17:55] in the message shalom he says the world
[1:17:58] is in one of the most chaotic times of
[1:18:02] darkness that it's ever stood in and
[1:18:05] this was in 1964.
[1:18:10] false forward to now
[1:18:14] look around you
[1:18:16] this world is in a chaotic state
[1:18:23] and yet
[1:18:25] in all of this chaos and
[1:18:28] craziness and
[1:18:29] wokeness and what all the stuff
[1:18:34] it is brother branham says standing in
[1:18:38] the most blessed
[1:18:40] light
[1:18:41] that it ever
[1:18:43] did
[1:18:44] shine
[1:18:46] in
[1:18:49] this revealed word
[1:18:52] and what a privileged people we are
[1:18:57] to have received this light amen
[1:19:01] that in the midst of chaos and in the
[1:19:04] midst of
[1:19:05] everything that's just going
[1:19:08] crazy
[1:19:11] needs to happen
[1:19:14] we are standing
[1:19:16] and we have
[1:19:18] in our possession
[1:19:20] the most
[1:19:22] blessed light
[1:19:24] that ever did shine
[1:19:27] what a privileged
[1:19:30] people
[1:19:31] even if we just sit and we think
[1:19:35] maybe we look at our work colleagues and
[1:19:37] we look at how people are reacting
[1:19:41] they're not responding they just react
[1:19:42] you know reacting is the way i sort of
[1:19:45] understand the action is if you take
[1:19:47] your knee and you just do that and your
[1:19:48] he just the food just goes
[1:19:50] it can cause damage people just want to
[1:19:52] react and react and react but i'm
[1:19:54] grateful for the word of god
[1:19:58] that is it's come my way and has given
[1:20:00] me a peace
[1:20:03] yes you know i i we
[1:20:05] face many things in life
[1:20:08] but this is where i'm anchored in
[1:20:15] brother branham in the invisible union
[1:20:17] of the bride
[1:20:18] and that's just laying a platform he
[1:20:20] says
[1:20:22] it talks about
[1:20:24] the bride of christ
[1:20:26] and that's who you are that's who i am
[1:20:29] he says here
[1:20:31] the illustration here showing the
[1:20:33] relationship
[1:20:35] of bride
[1:20:37] to christ
[1:20:39] and then he identifies us as the elect
[1:20:44] lady
[1:20:47] so i i i want to speak to you this
[1:20:49] morning
[1:20:50] as the elect
[1:20:53] lady
[1:20:55] i want to address you this morning
[1:20:57] as the elects
[1:21:00] lady
[1:21:02] he says um
[1:21:06] the church here and this for the kids in
[1:21:08] illustration we get is the church is
[1:21:11] illustrated by a woman
[1:21:16] for those many of us know that
[1:21:18] a woman is always a type of the church
[1:21:22] because the church is considered a bride
[1:21:25] she is
[1:21:27] the bride of the lord jesus
[1:21:30] the son of god
[1:21:32] so this morning as we as as as as we're
[1:21:36] going to allow the lord to to just speak
[1:21:39] to us this morning
[1:21:41] i'm very aware
[1:21:44] that i am addressing
[1:21:47] his elects
[1:21:50] i am addressing
[1:21:52] royalty sister priscilla

[1:21:58] you're not just some downtrodden
[1:22:00] something
[1:22:02] but you are special
[1:22:04] in the sight of the lord
[1:22:07] you might think in your heart i am
[1:22:10] nothing
[1:22:11] but i want you to know in the lord
[1:22:13] impressed on my heart to let you know
[1:22:17] that you are special
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:23] my new year's message
[1:22:26] is to the church elected
[1:22:30] that's who you are this morning
[1:22:33] elected in jesus christ
[1:22:38] not just the church groups

[1:22:47] excited to know that i am speaking i am
[1:22:51] looking at
[1:22:52] his
[1:22:54] elects
[1:22:56] that's who you are
[1:23:00] yes we've got to believe that brother
[1:23:03] andy
[1:23:06] he says

[1:23:28] elect

[1:23:32] as part of it amen
[1:23:34] he goes on he says may i add to this
[1:23:36] woman
[1:23:38] grace
[1:23:41] may i place it in the bible
[1:23:44] he said
[1:23:45] as called the elected lady
[1:23:50] that's who you are amen
[1:23:52] that's who i am
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:56] miss
[1:23:57] christ
[1:24:02] he says the bible declares to the elect
[1:24:06] lady
[1:24:07] he says
[1:24:09] one lady
[1:24:11] amongst all the other ladies
[1:24:14] so they might have been if you want the
[1:24:16] picture in your head the high society of
[1:24:18] life
[1:24:20] many ladies out there
[1:24:22] but is chosen one
[1:24:25] lady
[1:24:30] to the elect lady one lady among all the
[1:24:35] other ladies
[1:24:36] was elected
[1:24:39] that's you
[1:24:41] that's me
[1:24:44] talking about mary he says
[1:24:46] mary was an elected woman god chose mary
[1:24:51] we read she found favor
[1:24:55] you have found you might think i haven't
[1:24:59] but i'm here to let you know
[1:25:01] you have found favor
[1:25:04] with him
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:10] god
[1:25:12] has chose
[1:25:14] an elected lady
[1:25:18] i'm thankful
[1:25:21] that i can stand here
[1:25:24] and look at
[1:25:26] he's elected
[1:25:35] out of the greek
[1:25:36] lexicon
[1:25:38] that word elect
[1:25:41] it's it relates to being
[1:25:45] picked out
[1:25:47] it's like
[1:25:48] one in a million
[1:25:50] so there's so many
[1:25:53] people
[1:25:54] all over the world
[1:25:57] all over
[1:25:58] but god said
[1:26:00] hey that's mine
[1:26:07] isaac
[1:26:13] chosen by god
[1:26:19] i listened to brother ed's testimony
[1:26:21] yesterday
[1:26:23] and i said lord
[1:26:25] what a test
[1:26:28] chosen by god for the head
[1:26:31] elected so many other good people out
[1:26:34] there but god called you
[1:26:38] to receive this revealed word
[1:26:43] there are people and we know this right
[1:26:45] your people wrote today walking around
[1:26:47] with the bible that they don't
[1:26:49] understand
[1:26:50] they don't even see themselves in it but
[1:26:53] i am grateful to almighty god
[1:26:56] that this word has been revealed we are
[1:26:59] recipients of it we have received it
[1:27:02] brother ben
[1:27:03] and we see it
[1:27:05] in action
[1:27:08] in our lives
[1:27:10] in the greek lexicon it says
[1:27:13] that word elect
[1:27:15] means
[1:27:16] the best of its kind
[1:27:20] and that's what he thinks of you
[1:27:23] he think you are somebody the best
[1:27:30] so when you think i'm not i'm not i'm
[1:27:32] not you are the best
[1:27:37] i read it yesterday when you think you a
[1:27:39] weak weak christian his strength is made
[1:27:42] perfect in your weakness
[1:27:45] and you are chosen by him
[1:27:48] you are elected
[1:27:50] and walk away with us that i am the best
[1:27:54] of its kind
[1:27:58] amen chose me
[1:28:01] hey
[1:28:04] out of all
[1:28:05] that he could have
[1:28:06] but he chose me
[1:28:08] he chose you
[1:28:14] so when the devil comes and he
[1:28:17] definitely always wants to come and tell
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:22] you're not a christian
[1:28:24] or you're not worth it to
[1:28:25] this and that in the other you said
[1:28:28] devil shut up
[1:28:30] get away from here
[1:28:32] god has told me i'm elected god has told
[1:28:36] me i am the best
[1:28:39] i am the apple of his eye
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:49] this is real
[1:28:52] i'm not just giving you good words to
[1:28:53] excite you
[1:28:58] we're looking we look at samuel
[1:29:01] coming to
[1:29:03] to the house of jesse
[1:29:05] because god had said samuel
[1:29:08] i found me a man after my own heart
[1:29:13] so samuel comes and he's a man of god
[1:29:15] he's a he's a prophet
[1:29:18] hallelujah
[1:29:20] and yeah jesse's boys come before him
[1:29:22] and samuel standing there
[1:29:25] looks and says man this guy
[1:29:27] he looks the part
[1:29:30] but god said
[1:29:31] not him
[1:29:33] the next one comes samuel says i must be
[1:29:36] him man look at this
[1:29:42] the law says
[1:29:44] not him
[1:29:45] and one by one they come pause
[1:29:48] and i want to read the quote because
[1:29:49] it's so this is so awesome to me said
[1:29:53] joe vijayara god said
[1:29:55] i've refused them
[1:29:58] he says well
[1:30:00] he brought six of them
[1:30:02] and then samuel might have said haven't
[1:30:04] you got another one
[1:30:06] and jesse says yeah
[1:30:09] i've got the little old
[1:30:11] naughty fellow
[1:30:14] back over here
[1:30:17] herding some sheep
[1:30:21] i want to encourage
[1:30:23] us as parents not you as parents
[1:30:26] us as parents
[1:30:30] and the lord is dealing with me with
[1:30:32] these things
[1:30:34] we might look at our kids
[1:30:37] you know
[1:30:38] we want them to be where we are
[1:30:42] but we forget where we were
[1:30:44] at the edge
[1:30:46] or how we might have acted to react it
[1:30:49] at their age
[1:30:51] and we forget about the pressures of
[1:30:53] life that's not only on us but it's on
[1:30:55] them also
[1:30:57] we spoke about precious loss on
[1:30:58] wednesday
[1:31:02] i want to encourage us as parents maybe
[1:31:05] just let's
[1:31:06] taz also
[1:31:08] learn from this
[1:31:09] so jesse said yeah
[1:31:12] i've got a guy
[1:31:13] it's a lot he's naughty fellow back over
[1:31:16] here hurting some sheep
[1:31:18] but i'm sure he wouldn't look
[1:31:20] good as a king
[1:31:22] but samuel says bring him
[1:31:25] and as soon as little david with a
[1:31:28] little sheepskin coat on
[1:31:30] a little slingshot in his hand walking
[1:31:33] along toddling up like that stupid

[1:31:38] said
[1:31:39] the holy ghost shed
[1:31:43] that's my man
[1:31:46] not samuel saying that's my man the holy
[1:31:49] ghost said
[1:31:50] that's my man
[1:31:56] he knowed
[1:31:58] what was on the
[1:32:00] inside of him
[1:32:03] man looks on the outside
[1:32:06] but god
[1:32:08] he sees what's inside
[1:32:10] he looks in the heart
[1:32:13] i i really you know i
[1:32:15] i'm so burdened
[1:32:18] for us as parents
[1:32:20] especially me
[1:32:22] in the in the in sort of the stage that
[1:32:24] i am with my kids and i look back and i
[1:32:28] i see my friends and i see how when we
[1:32:31] grew up certain things happened and a
[1:32:33] lot of my friends just walked away
[1:32:36] and i said lord help me
[1:32:38] with my children lord
[1:32:40] just to be wise
[1:32:43] lord to understand to lord maybe think
[1:32:46] 18 year old thoughts and sometimes it's
[1:32:49] hard
[1:32:50] sometimes i want to where the kids are
[1:32:52] you know doing what they're doing or
[1:32:53] they're playing the music and i want to
[1:32:55] like be part of them and i try to act
[1:32:56] cool and i you know dance and go on like
[1:32:59] that and they'll say that
[1:33:01] no that's not cool
[1:33:04] and i think i'm cool
[1:33:06] but you know i just say lord help us
[1:33:10] even if we see alpha we think he's a
[1:33:13] naughty city a naughty fella
[1:33:17] god
[1:33:18] this see we as parents you know our kids
[1:33:21] they sit here in church
[1:33:23] and they're receiving the word
[1:33:26] the word is being preached into them
[1:33:29] and then and even at home you know they
[1:33:32] there are things happening
[1:33:34] in their lives
[1:33:37] and ariel i'm realizing more and more
[1:33:38] and more and more
[1:33:40] i need to pray more and more
[1:33:42] so we we we're praying
[1:33:45] for our children
[1:33:46] but you see david we see in there
[1:33:49] god said that's my man
[1:33:53] god chose him
[1:33:58] then just
[1:34:00] before i go on
[1:34:02] the enemy refers to isaiah 60
[1:34:05] chapter 1 which says rise and shine
[1:34:08] he says
[1:34:10] darkness is gathering
[1:34:13] what's it gathering for
[1:34:16] to show the light
[1:34:21] he says that's the reason i can say
[1:34:24] shalom
[1:34:26] the light has come
[1:34:28] to you
[1:34:30] god's peace to the elected woman
[1:34:35] to the elected lady
[1:34:38] you and i john
[1:34:41] we reflecting
[1:34:43] the light
[1:34:44] of the gospel
[1:34:47] i was having some fellowship with
[1:34:49] brother matt now the other day
[1:34:51] and we were just talking
[1:34:54] and we ended up talking about our
[1:34:56] children i think sister priscilla was
[1:34:58] there in the van talking about our
[1:35:00] children
[1:35:01] and we said how
[1:35:03] it's quite interesting that we're
[1:35:05] finding people out there
[1:35:08] are making or saying things about our
[1:35:11] children
[1:35:12] that maybe we're not seeing
[1:35:15] but they seeing something
[1:35:17] and because they don't understand the
[1:35:20] word and maybe they don't know jesus
[1:35:24] they don't realize but they are seeing
[1:35:26] jesus
[1:35:28] through our children
[1:35:30] our children
[1:35:32] is reflecting
[1:35:36] but they see it as
[1:35:38] oh your child is quite respectful
[1:35:41] child's got a beautiful smile
[1:35:44] i was told one day
[1:35:46] at a place where they said one of my
[1:35:48] kids they said you know when when she
[1:35:50] comes into the room it's like the room
[1:35:52] lights up
[1:35:54] and then you realize it's not about her
[1:35:58] but it's because of jesus christ
[1:36:01] so you and i we are reflectors we carry
[1:36:05] this word and this word
[1:36:08] is light to everywhere around us
[1:36:13] we are loving
[1:36:15] we know this
[1:36:17] in times of turmoil
[1:36:21] i've i haven't been this way before it's
[1:36:22] going crazy
[1:36:26] gross darkness all around us
[1:36:30] times of distress all around us
[1:36:34] like i said on wednesday pleasure
[1:36:36] pleasure pleasure all around us
[1:36:42] and if we are not careful
[1:36:44] if we don't watch and pray
[1:36:49] that pleasure pleasure pleasure
[1:36:53] or turmoil
[1:36:55] might want to attach itself
[1:36:58] to us
[1:37:01] galatians says
[1:37:03] 5
[1:37:04] 1. was the first sermon i ever preached
[1:37:09] it says stand fast therefore
[1:37:13] in the liberty
[1:37:15] wherewith christ hath made us free
[1:37:20] and be not entangled again
[1:37:26] with the yoke of bondage
[1:37:30] so even as christians
[1:37:33] he's called us
[1:37:35] he's elected us
[1:37:37] we are his purchase possession
[1:37:41] but the bible does say that we can be
[1:37:43] pulled
[1:37:44] by our diverse lust
[1:37:47] so we need to just be watchful
[1:37:50] and be prayerful
[1:37:53] that these
[1:37:54] times of turmoil
[1:37:57] does not
[1:37:58] impact us
[1:38:00] or affect us
[1:38:02] on wednesday we heard
[1:38:04] don't sign for that box of rattlesnakes
[1:38:09] you have the ability you have the
[1:38:12] authority to say no
[1:38:20] because the enemy wants to try at times
[1:38:22] just to
[1:38:23] to hinder
[1:38:26] he tries to hinder our hawk with god but
[1:38:28] the brandon actually talks he says um
[1:38:30] you know he talks about the the three
[1:38:31] things money women in popularity
[1:38:34] and he actually says
[1:38:36] i think i was talking to brother about
[1:38:38] this he said that money was i think was
[1:38:40] one of his big things
[1:38:42] and he said that
[1:38:44] he knew that money was a problem
[1:38:46] so he says i kept a covering over it and
[1:38:49] i couldn't understand what that mean huh
[1:38:51] why you want to cover up something but
[1:38:53] then i went further in other places
[1:38:55] where he talks about it and he says he
[1:38:57] kept the blood
[1:38:58] covering before that thing
[1:39:00] so he kept the word
[1:39:02] before it
[1:39:04] i just want to just read a little bit
[1:39:05] about that you know he says
[1:39:08] i have constantly done my very best
[1:39:11] he says he's talking now about how
[1:39:13] you know we we're talking with people
[1:39:15] and maybe we might disagree
[1:39:18] on doctrine or might disagree in
[1:39:20] religious terms but he says uh you know
[1:39:23] i've constantly done my best that when
[1:39:26] i'm speaking to ben and you know and
[1:39:28] maybe ben don't agree on something
[1:39:31] he says here
[1:39:33] i want to be able
[1:39:35] to take his hand afterwards
[1:39:38] with an open and honest heart he said he
[1:39:41] says i've constantly done my very best
[1:39:44] he says when disagreeing with man in
[1:39:47] religious terms
[1:39:49] but he says no but if i couldn't take
[1:39:52] his hand afterwards he says no matter
[1:39:55] how sharp the thing might be
[1:39:57] he says
[1:39:58] i need to stall
[1:40:01] love the person
[1:40:05] not he says just say it from my lips
[1:40:11] but he says from my heart
[1:40:16] and sometimes
[1:40:17] that's so hard
[1:40:20] but you are the elect
[1:40:24] there's something that's inside of you
[1:40:26] that will help you and
[1:40:30] i've had my experiences
[1:40:34] where i couldn't there are certain
[1:40:37] people
[1:40:38] that did so bad things and i just wanted
[1:40:41] to hate them and i just i didn't want to
[1:40:44] forgive them
[1:40:47] but it took almighty god
[1:40:50] to come my way
[1:40:52] to deal with me to let me die die die so
[1:40:57] that he could live
[1:41:00] so that when i look at that person
[1:41:03] and what i do is i test myself
[1:41:06] i test myself
[1:41:08] so
[1:41:10] if i see a photo of that person
[1:41:12] i ask myself
[1:41:15] how am i reacting when i just photo
[1:41:19] because in the past
[1:41:21] when i used to see a photo of that
[1:41:23] person
[1:41:28] something just comes up
[1:41:32] so for me and i mean everyone's
[1:41:33] different
[1:41:36] for me that was a test
[1:41:39] and
[1:41:40] and so
[1:41:41] i
[1:41:42] now when i
[1:41:44] the situation that i had
[1:41:46] i can now talk to that person
[1:41:49] and there's nothing
[1:41:52] hateful in my heart
[1:41:55] i can i can talk to the person and
[1:41:58] i feel compassion
[1:42:01] i feel sorry
[1:42:04] but it wasn't an easy road
[1:42:07] to get there
[1:42:10] it took years
[1:42:13] it took many years
[1:42:15] but you see i was so honest and said
[1:42:17] lord
[1:42:19] i need you
[1:42:20] more than ever
[1:42:23] and he would be the one to help me and
[1:42:24] yes
[1:42:25] so anyway
[1:42:26] he says here
[1:42:28] so you have your argument and debates
[1:42:30] and things but he says i need to love
[1:42:32] that person
[1:42:34] we must love
[1:42:35] the person amen
[1:42:37] and if i can feel that i don't like the
[1:42:41] person
[1:42:43] there's something
[1:42:44] wrong with me
[1:42:47] but now
[1:42:48] that's okay i think
[1:42:51] and i'm happy to be corrected and
[1:42:52] smashed afterwards
[1:42:54] i think if you come to that point
[1:42:58] that i'm still realizing
[1:43:00] that there's a scratch
[1:43:03] for that person whenever i see them or i
[1:43:06] see a photo or i hear of them
[1:43:09] for the brown says there's something
[1:43:10] wrong
[1:43:11] i think that's okay because as long as
[1:43:14] you
[1:43:15] recognize
[1:43:17] that there is something
[1:43:19] wrong
[1:43:20] so that you can go and make it right
[1:43:25] that's the
[1:43:26] that's what i love about my lord jesus
[1:43:30] he comes and he
[1:43:31] highlights these things to me in my life
[1:43:33] and he tells me
[1:43:35] you're the elect you are called and
[1:43:37] tears you bright but because you are
[1:43:39] pride there's just some kind of way
[1:43:42] you'd conduct yourself
[1:43:45] you know a lady they in the olden days
[1:43:47] and the posh days you know you'd have
[1:43:49] the ladies you should drink a tea a
[1:43:51] certain way you know she'll hold the cup
[1:43:53] and and you know they have this heighty
[1:43:56] tighty conversations and they'll you
[1:43:58] know conduct themselves a certain way to
[1:44:00] society
[1:44:03] but we don't just do that you know in
[1:44:05] public in private we also conduct
[1:44:08] ourselves
[1:44:10] as sons and daughters
[1:44:12] of the most
[1:44:14] so even if we find you know that
[1:44:18] you know that thing there as long as we
[1:44:20] recognize
[1:44:22] that you know what
[1:44:23] that's an issue that needs to be dealt
[1:44:25] with
[1:44:26] we deal with it
[1:44:28] that's who we are i mean
[1:44:31] it's hard
[1:44:33] i know that but we just deal with it
[1:44:36] if we need help
[1:44:38] we have people that's willing to help
[1:44:41] because we want to grow together
[1:44:48] and why i read that is when brandon goes
[1:44:50] further he talks about jesus christ
[1:44:54] he speaks about the spirit of christ he
[1:44:57] says the spirit of christ when they were
[1:45:00] crucified him
[1:45:04] now many times we look at ourselves and
[1:45:06] we think and this people is doing me
[1:45:08] harm or these people is just crucifying
[1:45:11] me so to speak or these people are doing
[1:45:13] this and they doing all that kind of
[1:45:16] stuff to me
[1:45:17] then we forget
[1:45:19] what did he go through what did our lord
[1:45:22] jesus christ
[1:45:24] what did he experience
[1:45:26] brother branham says
[1:45:28] as they were putting the nails
[1:45:31] in his hands
[1:45:34] brother branson's yet
[1:45:36] with a heart
[1:45:38] full
[1:45:39] of love
[1:45:43] he cried father
[1:45:46] forgive them
[1:45:49] they don't know what they're doing
[1:45:54] and he says here i've come to that spot
[1:45:57] i believe
[1:45:58] that people
[1:46:00] don't know what they doing
[1:46:04] i believe it's only maturity
[1:46:07] that can say that
[1:46:10] and that can understand
[1:46:13] that maybe this person is reacting in a
[1:46:16] certain way
[1:46:18] but
[1:46:18] you understand
[1:46:21] that maybe there's a reason
[1:46:23] why
[1:46:27] father ben told us yesterday i hope it's
[1:46:29] okay
[1:46:30] he says um
[1:46:31] i do i don't eat leftover foods
[1:46:33] is it true
[1:46:35] true
[1:46:36] and i thought my goodness i could not
[1:46:38] eat leftover fruits
[1:46:40] but then you put us in perspective
[1:46:45] as to why he doesn't
[1:46:48] and then i thought brother could ben
[1:46:50] if i was in your shoes
[1:46:52] i probably also wouldn't want to eat
[1:46:53] leftover food
[1:46:55] because we understand
[1:47:00] i don't think i mentioned here
[1:47:02] i had a situation at work
[1:47:05] where this lady was just men
[1:47:08] she was
[1:47:10] pushing down and just man i don't know
[1:47:14] she was just treating me terrible
[1:47:18] she would
[1:47:19] say bad things about me and
[1:47:21] even pull me up in front of the
[1:47:23] directors
[1:47:24] and i couldn't understand because
[1:47:27] i'm not doing anything wrong
[1:47:30] and then one day she did something
[1:47:32] and i wanted to flare up
[1:47:35] i wanted to react
[1:47:37] and i said now this is nonsense i'm not
[1:47:39] gonna take this i'm a christian i'm the
[1:47:40] son of god
[1:47:42] but then the lord told me and said this
[1:47:46] wait
[1:47:47] yeah
[1:47:48] don't react
[1:47:50] respond
[1:47:53] what i want you to do tess
[1:47:54] wait 24 hours
[1:47:58] i wanted to react immediately because i
[1:48:00] mean i was
[1:48:01] ready to
[1:48:02] go
[1:48:04] the lord said wait
[1:48:06] 24 hours
[1:48:07] and i waited as hard as it was i waited
[1:48:11] 24 hours and i'm glad i did that
[1:48:13] because then when i could speak to this
[1:48:16] person
[1:48:17] i could step that anger and that
[1:48:20] reaction was gone i could speak
[1:48:23] human to human
[1:48:25] and then as i started speaking
[1:48:29] i
[1:48:30] understood why the person was reacting
[1:48:34] the way she was reacting and then i
[1:48:37] could then readjust the way i did things
[1:48:41] so that
[1:48:42] it didn't happen going forward and today
[1:48:45] we're working fantastically together
[1:48:48] so brother branham says
[1:48:50] with a heart full of love
[1:48:53] he says father forgive them
[1:48:56] and he says i believe
[1:48:58] that people
[1:48:59] don't
[1:49:00] know
[1:49:01] what they're doing so when you get faced
[1:49:03] with people coming up against you
[1:49:06] feel compassion for them
[1:49:08] say lord show me why are they going on
[1:49:11] the way they're going on i think i mean
[1:49:14] everything is okay
[1:49:16] it's also lord maybe is this something
[1:49:17] that i need to do to make right
[1:49:20] if he shows it to you
[1:49:22] you know as hard as it is
[1:49:23] make right
[1:49:25] you see the spirit of the day it's it's
[1:49:28] it's it's trying to constitute you yeah
[1:49:31] it's trying to make you walk you know we
[1:49:33] were yearning a certain sound but it's
[1:49:35] trying to make you know all how am i you
[1:49:38] know is the word really as powerful as
[1:49:41] they say it is
[1:49:42] well you know it's the the spirit of the
[1:49:45] day is trying to break us down it's
[1:49:48] trying to cause chaos in our lives
[1:49:51] because you see god has come and said i
[1:49:53] speak peace to you
[1:49:56] but the enemy doesn't want you to live
[1:49:58] in peace
[1:49:59] so he tries these various things to
[1:50:02] unsteady you
[1:50:05] try to break up families
[1:50:08] break up brotherhood
[1:50:10] but you see we are weary and we are
[1:50:12] aware of his devices
[1:50:14] i use that terminology in church ages we
[1:50:17] are able to discern and to withstand
[1:50:21] and we say lord give me discernment lord
[1:50:24] so that i can understand things and then
[1:50:26] give me wisdom
[1:50:28] on how
[1:50:30] to do what i need to do
[1:50:33] and we know that
[1:50:35] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:50:38] is of vital importance
[1:50:40] because with the baptism of the holy
[1:50:42] ghost where the brain says you will bear
[1:50:44] the fruit
[1:50:46] of the spirit
[1:50:47] and you will find yourself in love with
[1:50:51] your enemies
[1:50:53] that is a characteristic
[1:50:55] of the elect lady
[1:50:57] we conduct ourselves according to the
[1:51:00] word
[1:51:05] he says when you really find yourself
[1:51:07] talking about your enemy that you love
[1:51:10] him
[1:51:11] regardless of what they do you
[1:51:14] still
[1:51:15] love them
[1:51:18] he says if you do get stirred up and i
[1:51:21] think i mentioned this on wednesday
[1:51:24] go and pray
[1:51:26] first
[1:51:27] before you talk to him
[1:51:29] oh by the end he at all i said if you do
[1:51:32] react
[1:51:33] and you you know
[1:51:35] cause whatever you make that fire bigger
[1:51:38] god as i highlighted to you
[1:51:40] a situation that i need to look into
[1:51:42] into myself
[1:51:43] and you go and you go and pray and say
[1:51:45] lord help me help me
[1:51:49] i want to grow
[1:51:51] brother branham says temper
[1:51:54] breeds
[1:51:55] temper
[1:51:56] you know what it's like
[1:51:58] we get angry and i get angry and that
[1:52:01] person gets angry and then it just
[1:52:03] explodes and escalates
[1:52:06] so i want to i want to read this because
[1:52:07] this is the negative right he says
[1:52:08] temper breeds temp
[1:52:11] and he says then you grieve the holy
[1:52:13] spirit away from you
[1:52:15] he says the holy spirit takes its flight
[1:52:18] temper breeds temper but then he says
[1:52:22] but love
[1:52:24] breeds love
[1:52:27] so be full of love
[1:52:32] and us on the outside coming here in and
[1:52:34] and just experiencing wellington and the
[1:52:36] believers we are seeing by the ad love
[1:52:42] just continue to
[1:52:44] love
[1:52:45] because as your love projects
[1:52:48] to daniel daniel's love just projects
[1:52:51] back to me
[1:52:56] he says and you've seen people
[1:52:59] that you just love
[1:53:01] to be around
[1:53:03] and as i look
[1:53:05] at your faces
[1:53:07] i am seeing a people that we as the
[1:53:10] jeopardies
[1:53:11] we just love
[1:53:13] to be around
[1:53:17] i had a driver by the met we went
[1:53:19] somewhere and he was showing me his
[1:53:21] awesome stuff
[1:53:22] and there were times it was just quiet
[1:53:24] in the car
[1:53:25] but man i just loved
[1:53:27] sitting in the car brother matt
[1:53:30] i just loved
[1:53:32] just being with him
[1:53:35] sitting with the brothers
[1:53:36] sometimes my wife actually asked me
[1:53:38] yesterday so you know did you guys talk
[1:53:40] a lot i said no there were just times we
[1:53:42] were just sitting
[1:53:43] you know just sitting
[1:53:45] there
[1:53:46] but i like that that's it
[1:53:48] you know it's just i love
[1:53:50] being
[1:53:51] around you
[1:53:53] you're just fine for the po i looked at
[1:53:56] that photo that you took of us standing
[1:53:57] like that
[1:53:58] i just love
[1:54:00] being
[1:54:02] around you
[1:54:03] and i hope that you love
[1:54:06] being around the jeffers
[1:54:09] because we just love you
[1:54:14] you've seen people that you just love to
[1:54:17] be around
[1:54:19] they create that atmosphere
[1:54:27] he says they create that atmosphere not
[1:54:30] just by singing in churches raising
[1:54:31] their hands
[1:54:33] they create that atmosphere by the life
[1:54:37] that they love
[1:54:41] the life that you live
[1:54:43] not just in church
[1:54:45] but at home
[1:54:46] at work walking down the street the life
[1:54:50] that you love creates an atmosphere
[1:54:57] the way that they
[1:54:59] talk
[1:55:04] a friend of mine in london
[1:55:08] christian colombia i think you would
[1:55:09] have known who he is
[1:55:11] he wrote a song
[1:55:13] that says
[1:55:14] my language has changed
[1:55:17] and that is what this word has done to
[1:55:19] me
[1:55:20] my language has changed i speak peace
[1:55:26] i speak victory
[1:55:28] because i am eating the book
[1:55:43] so the way they
[1:55:45] their conversation
[1:55:48] and even it was just no conversation
[1:55:49] just sitting there
[1:55:51] because you know i know that as we're
[1:55:53] sitting there
[1:55:54] we're thinking about him
[1:55:56] we're thinking of good
[1:55:58] things creates the atmosphere
[1:56:02] so for the being yesterday we sat at the
[1:56:03] table
[1:56:04] and you sat there
[1:56:06] and i sat here
[1:56:08] and by the edge was making coffee
[1:56:10] and it was so quiet
[1:56:13] i just loved it
[1:56:15] because i was sitting in an atmosphere
[1:56:18] i was sitting with believers
[1:56:21] and i know
[1:56:22] love
[1:56:23] the same god
[1:56:25] who i love
[1:56:27] all of our loves who my children loves
[1:56:31] so i love
[1:56:33] being around you and i think cleveland
[1:56:35] we need to visit them more
[1:56:37] but then at the same time
[1:56:40] i love in cambridge
[1:56:42] i can count on my fingers how many
[1:56:44] people has been to my house
[1:56:51] we just love you
[1:56:53] he says here talking about creating the
[1:56:55] atmosphere
[1:56:56] and the things that you think on
[1:56:58] the things that you do
[1:57:00] the actions
[1:57:02] the things you talk about
[1:57:04] creates
[1:57:05] the atmosphere
[1:57:08] so it's important
[1:57:12] think on him
[1:57:15] yeah
[1:57:17] situations problems trials
[1:57:20] it's gonna be there
[1:57:22] but instead of looking at the problem
[1:57:24] and saying oh this is so hard
[1:57:28] look at the word yes
[1:57:30] i i always i like to say this i always
[1:57:32] say you know we see the problem there
[1:57:35] yeah the problem is there but let's just
[1:57:38] look above
[1:57:39] and brother let's look at the promises
[1:57:41] of god
[1:57:42] and let's think about the promises of
[1:57:44] god let's focus on the promises of god
[1:57:48] because then we're creating an
[1:57:49] atmosphere and then that problem looks
[1:57:52] so small
[1:57:54] because we're living under a heavenly
[1:57:57] atmosphere we're living under an
[1:58:00] atmosphere that tells me all things are
[1:58:03] possible
[1:58:04] i'm living under an atmosphere that
[1:58:07] tells me there is nothing
[1:58:10] my god is greater
[1:58:12] my god is stronger
[1:58:15] lord you are higher than
[1:58:17] any other
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:30] you see you
[1:58:32] reflect the light
[1:58:36] this word
[1:58:38] is being manifested
[1:58:40] in you
[1:58:42] and our brother branham says this
[1:58:45] is the light of the hour
[1:58:48] he says the word
[1:58:50] the manifested word of god
[1:58:53] so when you're walking around at school
[1:58:56] at school if you go to school or at work
[1:58:58] or at uni
[1:59:00] you bears of the light
[1:59:08] and if the word says
[1:59:10] shalom
[1:59:11] if the word says peace
[1:59:14] you receive it
[1:59:21] so today we know that gross darkness is
[1:59:24] upon the people
[1:59:26] but brother branham says yeah
[1:59:28] we are
[1:59:30] there's darkness
[1:59:32] and there's you
[1:59:33] god has allotted his word to be
[1:59:36] manifested this day
[1:59:39] it's the only light we have
[1:59:42] and god
[1:59:43] is going to let somebody
[1:59:47] manifest that word
[1:59:49] and i believe with all my heart as i'm
[1:59:51] looking at you today you are that
[1:59:55] somebody that's reflecting this word
[2:00:00] you might think i'm not
[2:00:02] but go and speak to the sin out there
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:06] and just listen to their testimony about
[2:00:10] you
[2:00:12] listen to their testimony about you

[2:03:28] so he's calling you
[2:03:31] and we know it
[2:03:34] he's calling the virtuous bride and
[2:03:36] that's who you are
[2:03:39] the word
[2:03:40] the last day church
[2:03:42] the elected lady
[2:03:45] that's who you are
[2:03:47] he
[2:03:48] the bridegroom
[2:03:50] he took
[2:03:52] away
[2:03:54] your
[2:03:55] shame
[2:03:56] amen
[2:03:57] if you're sitting here this morning
[2:04:00] and you have a feeling of shame
[2:04:04] you know you've done things we've all
[2:04:06] done things
[2:04:07] i had to actually talk to a
[2:04:09] family member of mine in south africa
[2:04:13] she's she's done such a lot wrong
[2:04:16] and i had to encourage her
[2:04:19] and i had to tell you know what
[2:04:21] you got to be honest with him and he
[2:04:24] will take that shame

[2:04:28] the brandon says he took
[2:04:31] away
[2:04:32] your shame
[2:04:34] amen
[2:04:36] and he put it in the sea of
[2:04:38] forgetfulness
[2:04:39] by the washing
[2:04:41] of the water
[2:04:43] of the word
[2:04:45] so as we receive the word
[2:04:48] we allow the word to come and just to
[2:04:52] wash us
[2:04:54] and that's why sometimes when we're
[2:04:55] sitting in church and we and we hear
[2:04:58] certain things that's being said
[2:05:00] and we feel a brick in our hearts or we
[2:05:04] feel is
[2:05:06] i need to make this right i don't want
[2:05:08] it anymore it's him
[2:05:11] speaking
[2:05:12] it's him saying just come
[2:05:15] up higher
[2:05:17] that's where i want you to be it's him
[2:05:20] coming and he's washing you
[2:05:26] and then i want you to walk away with
[2:05:27] this
[2:05:29] you are standing
[2:05:31] completely
[2:05:34] justified
[2:05:36] as though you never
[2:05:38] did it
[2:05:39] in the beginning
[2:05:42] but obviously we do know that there's
[2:05:43] requirements that goes with that so i've
[2:05:46] done wrong he made a way of escape
[2:05:50] i gotta go to him and say lord forgive
[2:05:53] me
[2:05:54] i repent of my wrong
[2:05:58] he says you're you're standing
[2:06:00] completely justified as though you never
[2:06:03] did it at the beginning
[2:06:04] this is my message to the church now
[2:06:12] and then he says talk about a
[2:06:15] thanksgiving

[2:06:59] that and the devil will remind me you
[2:07:01] did that and did that
[2:07:03] but as long as we make right
[2:07:06] the wrong
[2:07:08] he doesn't see it
[2:07:10] anymore
