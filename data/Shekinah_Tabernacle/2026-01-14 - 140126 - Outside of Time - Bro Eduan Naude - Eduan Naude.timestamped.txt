[17:45] Lord, but also we do not under want to
[17:49] underell or undervalue,
[17:52] Lord, that you've chosen us and that
[17:54] you've put on our a crown on our head,
[17:58] Lord, to say we are bride. We are part
[18:00] of you, Lord, and and we will return to
[18:04] you, Lord. May we be here tonight in an
[18:08] atmosphere where you feel welcome, Lord,
[18:11] where you can lead, where you can take
[18:13] control, Lord, where you can fight the
[18:16] battle as the captain of the host, Lord.
[18:19] And you are not for us and not against
[18:20] us, Lord. You are the captain of the
[18:22] host. You are sovereign, Lord. You take
[18:24] over, Lord. Our thoughts are not your
[18:27] thoughts, Lord, and our ways are not
[18:28] your ways, Lord. May you just be with us
[18:32] now. Thank you so much for the
[18:34] atmosphere that our musicians create and
[18:36] our people at the back Lord, the
[18:38] technical, they not not not a lot of
[18:40] times they take credit, Lord. And please
[18:43] have something in store in your
[18:44] storehouse for them as well. For each
[18:47] one of uses, Lord, that's coming with a
[18:48] with a need and with a desire on our
[18:50] heart. May you speak with us, Lord.
[18:53] Speak through this vessel, Lord. May I
[18:55] just walk out of the way, Lord. May may
[18:58] I be like a a third person or a second
[19:01] person standing here Lord as just you
[19:03] behind this pullpit Lord.
[19:07] Um
[19:08] we bless your holy name. We love and
[19:11] appreciate you Lord. Bring the bring the
[19:14] nerves now down Lord so I can
[19:16] concentrate on what you want to say in
[19:19] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[19:22] Amen.
[19:24] Good evening saints and welcome in the
[19:27] house of the Lord. Thank you so much
[19:29] musicians. Beautiful songs. Really
[19:32] enjoying it. Um I actually was thinking
[19:36] of making it part of my sermon just to
[19:38] throw up a little slide of where we
[19:41] started as musicians. You know, once I
[19:44] was actually seen as a musician and I
[19:47] was playing some sort of miscellaneous
[19:50] drum toy and um and look look we've
[19:54] where we've come now. I wanted to do a
[19:56] before and after. It's just amazing
[19:59] where we've come. And with that in mind,
[20:02] it it it it's not unrelated to my title.
[20:06] I I wanted to just say that
[20:10] the Lord will place you at the right
[20:12] time in the right place. You need to be
[20:15] humble and listen to him
[20:18] &gt;&gt; and take the opportunity if it's outside
[20:20] your comfort zone. Just go for it. Just
[20:23] go for it. Who Who said it that Nike ad?
[20:26] Just do it. Just do it. Don't Don't hold
[20:29] back.
[20:32] Okay, let's let's read. Um thank you,
[20:35] Juel. you can put up that um first
[20:37] slide. Oh uh brother fish, where's the
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, awesome. Thank you.
[20:50] Okay, let's read from Genesis 1 verse
[20:52] one.
[20:55] Let's mute that.
[21:05] And then we'll read from um Exodus 3. So
[21:08] it's just the the next uh next book so
[21:11] it makes it easy. Uh Exodus 3. So
[21:15] Genesis 1 vers1 in the beginning God
[21:18] created the heaven and the earth. And
[21:21] the earth was was without form and void
[21:25] and darkness was upon the face of the
[21:27] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[21:30] the face of the waters. And God said,
[21:31] "Let there be light." And there was
[21:34] light.
[21:36] And then Exodus, Exodus 3 verse 13-
[21:41] 15,
[21:46] by the help of the Lord, they will guide
[21:48] me to tie this two together.
[21:52] Whatever I'm going to say tonight,
[21:54] whatever I'm going to display, whatever
[21:56] is coming
[21:58] over these lips, think of God. Think
[22:01] God. Think not not anything else.
[22:04] There's a lot of science and physics and
[22:06] stuff maybe I will throw around here.
[22:09] Brother Isaac, I don't know. This type
[22:10] of sermons is it's your sermons right up
[22:12] your alley. I don't know why the Lord
[22:14] opened this door, but okay, here I am.
[22:18] Exodus 3. And Moses said unto God,
[22:22] "Behold, when I come unto the children
[22:24] of Israel, and say unto them, the God of
[22:28] your fathers has sent me unto you, and
[22:30] they shall say to me, what is his name?
[22:34] What shall I say unto them?" And God
[22:36] said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he
[22:40] said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the
[22:43] children of Israel, I am hath sent me
[22:47] unto you."
[22:49] And then verse verse 15. And God said
[22:52] moreover unto Moses, thou shalt thou say
[22:56] unto the children of Israel, the Lord
[22:58] God your fathers, the God of Abraham,
[23:00] the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
[23:03] has sent me unto you. This is my name
[23:06] forever, and this is my memorial unto
[23:09] all generations.
[23:12] Amen. You may have your seats. God bless
[23:15] the reading of his word.
[23:18] and let's kick this off. Hopefully I
[23:21] won't be too long. Um,
[23:26] so yeah, if you if you would just stay
[23:30] with me. So here's my here's my title
[23:32] for the for this evening is outside of
[23:35] time. Now brother Ed, why do you have a
[23:38] picture there of Moses in the burning
[23:39] bush saying outside of time? Well,
[23:44] it is funny. This morning's reading that
[23:46] Brother Ben put up was to do with the I
[23:48] am and the present tense. And I go,
[23:51] "Wow, it's this is the I am speaking
[23:54] here to Moses."
[23:56] And it made me wonder sort of maybe made
[23:59] you wonder the bush.
[24:02] Why didn't it get consumed?
[24:05] Now my angle tonight is that
[24:10] if it burned out it will be tied to
[24:13] duration. So stay with me. Duration or
[24:16] time which would have an end. But
[24:19] because the I am was in the bush it
[24:22] would have just burned forever.
[24:24] Now think now of thus us and you
[24:27] believers that same fire or that burning
[24:32] inside of you. the great I am living
[24:34] inside of you. So keep that in mind in
[24:37] terms of time, in terms of space, in
[24:39] terms of matter. I started asking
[24:42] myself, I started thinking about this
[24:44] finite thought
[24:47] um people saying my God is this big or
[24:50] my that that song, how's that song go?
[24:52] My god is so big, so strong and so and
[24:56] it made me wonder God is outside of
[24:59] space and matter. So, how big is he
[25:02] really? This is the one for the kids
[25:03] now. So, here
[25:07] who could tell me what do you think is
[25:09] that?
[25:12] Hey,
[25:13] &gt;&gt; the sun. So, the big main object there
[25:17] is the sun.
[25:19] Now, I probably can't point there, but
[25:23] you you live in the third dot from the
[25:26] left. So you've got Jupiter down here
[25:29] which is the the main or the second
[25:32] largest object there. So basically just
[25:35] just left of that is Earth. So you can't
[25:37] really see it. That is the aim of this
[25:40] exercise. Right. Okay. And then the next
[25:43] the next image
[25:46] that is just a bunch of stars and they
[25:49] are all bigger than our sun. You might
[25:53] see the sun there. There's a white speck
[25:54] on the bottom right.
[25:57] But all this all this is just still
[26:00] sizes right? It it it it relates to some
[26:03] some matter. It relates to uh it takes
[26:06] up this this amount of space.
[26:10] And if I say my God is this big that
[26:13] means I'm still putting a limitation on
[26:16] God. It means that whether he's 10,000
[26:20] galaxies big, I'm still putting him in a
[26:24] box, so to speak. Even though I couldn't
[26:26] see that boxes, it's just that big. But
[26:29] there will be a time where he can't be
[26:31] 11,000 galaxies. And that's the same as
[26:36] time. So if we say
[26:40] God is finite or God lives within time,
[26:43] we put a limitation on God as well. So
[26:46] we will have a beginning which will mean
[26:48] he will have an end. That will mean we
[26:50] will have an end. And to some degree yes
[26:53] that is maybe true. But let's move on.
[26:57] God is a spirit and they that worship
[27:03] him must worship him in spirit and in
[27:07] truth.
[27:09] So let's stay there just uh for a
[27:11] second. Now this is where my thought is
[27:14] is not his thoughts. My thought I wanted
[27:17] to go into the pattern of how big God
[27:20] is. I like to be big. I like to you know
[27:22] I used to jump or whatever whatever. And
[27:24] you you you want to you know show show
[27:27] off uh and I wanted to show how how do
[27:30] we boast with God? How big is God? And
[27:33] then he took a little bit of a turn. He
[27:35] said well okay I've created everything
[27:37] as in the beginning. I created time,
[27:41] space and matter. So all of a sudden I
[27:44] went down this avenue of time.
[27:47] God exists independently of time because
[27:50] he is the creator of time. Simple
[27:53] concept not not not simple to to
[27:56] understand of course because we live
[27:59] within time.
[28:02] time our flesh time began with the
[28:04] creation of the universe that uh which
[28:07] God brought into existence out of
[28:09] nothing and this is what Genesis 1:1
[28:12] states in the beginning God created the
[28:14] heavens and the earth so that marks the
[28:16] initiation of time as a dimension with
[28:21] within created order all big words sorry
[28:24] about that Psalm 90:2 declares before
[28:28] the mountains were brought forth or ever
[28:30] thou hast formed the earth and the world
[28:32] even from everlasting to everlasting.
[28:35] Thou art God. Now this verse affirms
[28:38] that God's existence stretches
[28:41] infinitely before and beyond creation
[28:45] independent from times constraints. I've
[28:47] got a time constraint here. There's a
[28:49] countdown thing going off here. So I am
[28:52] limited to we need to go to bed tonight
[28:54] somewhere eventually, you know. So we
[28:57] need to move on. He's outside of that
[29:01] time as understood by us humans is a
[29:04] consequence and this is nice is a
[29:07] consequence of moments marked by change.
[29:11] God being immutable or God being
[29:13] unchanging transcends uh transcends time
[29:18] because he's not subject to change.
[29:20] Malachi 3:6 proclaims for I am the Lord
[29:24] I change not.
[29:27] God's simult God's timeliness
[29:31] means that he perceives all moments of
[29:34] history simultaneously.
[29:37] So try and get your head around that. I
[29:39] I'm I'm not there yet. So um I want to
[29:42] color this this little picture. And so
[29:46] while I while I've got it there,
[29:49] Brother Brandon was saying
[29:52] I want to draw a small little picture to
[29:54] you talking now. Let's all take a little
[29:56] trip. If you want to stare at the at the
[29:59] at the picture, you want to close your
[30:02] eyes or whatever, just try and get there
[30:05] with God. While his prophet is
[30:07] explaining this, let's go get on a
[30:10] little ship, a little spaceship. Let's
[30:12] go back a 100 million years before there
[30:15] was a world, before there even was a
[30:17] star or anything. And there you can see
[30:20] nothing but space. And all that space
[30:23] was God. in the beginning was God. And
[30:26] we'll see coming into existing a little
[30:29] white light. We'll call that a like a
[30:31] halo and that was the son of God, the
[30:34] logos, the word that went out of God in
[30:36] the beginning. And then that how uh that
[30:40] he was standing there and he think in
[30:43] his mind I begin to think what the world
[30:45] would be. And he drew all this picture
[30:48] in his mind and he said, let there be
[30:50] light. and an atom split and begin to
[30:53] break forward and an atom went off. The
[30:56] first atomic explosion. Big bang theory
[31:00] maybe. And then some atoms
[31:03] begin to accumulate until it was in
[31:05] cinders or as the moisture begin to
[31:08] break and the atoms split and after a
[31:11] while become a star or a piece like a
[31:14] missile that flew off and went sailing
[31:16] through the air. He watched it maybe for
[31:19] few million years and then stopped it.
[31:21] He had no hurry. He had plenty of time
[31:26] um forever. He was from the beginning to
[31:28] the end. There was no time with him. And
[31:32] then another one flies off and he stops
[31:34] at this way. What was he doing? He was
[31:37] writing his first Bible. The first Bible
[31:39] was ever written was written in the
[31:41] skies in the zodiac. That starts off
[31:44] with a virgin. That's how we come first.
[31:47] And it ends with Leo the lion, the
[31:48] second coming. the one we waiting for
[31:50] right now again and he's writing his
[31:53] first Bible. The second Bible was
[31:54] written was written by Enoch and put in
[31:57] the pyramid. The third Bible was written
[32:00] the one last one and this is the one
[32:02] that we use today. This is our
[32:05] reference.
[32:07] Now in the same vein
[32:10] God that's outside of time.
[32:13] So which led me thought of God not
[32:17] staring at a clock. Now why I'm saying
[32:21] that not staring at a clock to wait for
[32:23] a certain second or certain hour hand or
[32:26] anything to move to see a task
[32:29] accomplished by someone like you towards
[32:33] you.
[32:35] We are from God and we are going back to
[32:38] God. Now he's attentive then on us and
[32:41] towards us. He's attentive towards you.
[32:45] Where are you right now? He's watching
[32:48] you stepping into place, standing in a
[32:52] righteous spot that he for ordained
[32:54] before heaven and earth ever created. He
[32:57] put in motion this gathering of saints.
[33:00] So he's not looking at a watch or a
[33:02] clock or time that he created. He's
[33:05] watching and waiting for us to move into
[33:07] a certain step. That's why I refer to
[33:10] this band when I started here 2013 or
[33:14] whenever it was. Um,
[33:16] that was me then. Now all of a sudden we
[33:20] have this this most awesome headache
[33:22] that brother Isaac has got to choose
[33:25] musicians for certain evenings to play
[33:28] and all that. So we're in a in an
[33:30] absolute goodstead because back then
[33:33] didn't have any option. And here I'm
[33:35] sitting I'm seeing that time has gone by
[33:39] but these musicians or these they were
[33:41] also 7 9 11 years old and they moved
[33:45] into they stepped into a position when I
[33:50] was here uh we were trying to get the
[33:51] streaming going and all that. Brother
[33:54] Matt Matt stepped in and he opened his
[33:56] laptop and started doing these matrix
[33:58] little things. You just see zeros and
[34:00] numbers and ones everywhere going and he
[34:03] made our streaming work and got a camera
[34:06] and everything and he streamlined it and
[34:08] got nice processes in. That was a
[34:12] someone that's stepping into something
[34:15] that was that was needed that was there
[34:17] was a burden and someone listened and
[34:20] someone heeded to that call. Now,
[34:26] yeah. And I'll stop.
[34:29] I'll pause here. Sorry.
[34:31] Now, I've got a testimony. It's not a
[34:34] testimony. It's actually just what
[34:35] happened. And I thought the the
[34:36] conversation we had afterwards. We were
[34:39] up and visiting the the Stu family in um
[34:42] in Funere. And uh we were finding or
[34:46] trying to find a spot where we can just
[34:47] have a little fish and chips and next to
[34:49] the uh the port or the see the boats and
[34:52] the ships and the and um there's this
[34:55] lady coming I think it was what was it
[34:57] town called Opua or something just close
[35:00] to um Pa
[35:03] and um there's this lady with his
[35:05] baggage and bags and I don't know how
[35:07] many things and she's trying to to to
[35:10] take this now to one of the one of the
[35:13] the boat ramps and um we've got all the
[35:17] boys there and we just oh just take some
[35:18] of the boys and let them carry this. Oh
[35:20] no no no we can't do that. I said no
[35:22] take them. And they they go off and they
[35:24] found some sort of it's all numbered
[35:27] alphabetically. They you know ABC was
[35:30] looking for I or J or something. I said
[35:32] okay take the boys. And we we didn't
[35:35] have time so we weren't in a hurry. We
[35:38] were just waiting there. I could have
[35:39] more fish and chips than them maybe. But
[35:41] um and they off off they went and they
[35:44] helped them and she was just so grateful
[35:46] for that. And afterwards the
[35:49] conversation I had with the with the
[35:51] with the boys was don't undervalue small
[35:54] little things that you do. Don't under
[35:57] value the the step that you take or the
[35:59] gesture that gesture that you give to
[36:01] your colleague or maybe a school buddy.
[36:04] Um something greater will be put in
[36:06] motion. So don't be far from that still
[36:09] small voice say just do it man. Um
[36:12] there's a there's a bigger blessing or
[36:14] something bigger that will come out from
[36:15] that. If you have one example look at
[36:18] that small pebble that made a giant
[36:20] fall. Same size pebble thrown in the air
[36:23] and then initiated an earthquake.
[36:25] There's a small motion of a small little
[36:27] thing of obedience but there's a greater
[36:30] effect. And this could be for the
[36:32] kingdom of God. This could be to glorify
[36:34] his name. Right?
[36:36] Okay, let's use get some examples here
[36:38] from from the word Joshua. And it came
[36:42] to pass as they fled from uh as they
[36:44] fled from before Israel and were in the
[36:47] going down of Bethor that the that the
[36:50] Lord cast down great stones from heaven
[36:53] upon them uh unto Ezek and they died.
[36:57] And they were more which died with
[36:59] hailstones than them whom the children
[37:02] of Israel slew with a sword. Then spake
[37:05] Joshua to the Lord in the day when the
[37:08] Lord delivered up the Amorites before
[37:10] the children of Israel. And he said unto
[37:13] them, he said in the sight of Israel,
[37:17] son, stand thou still upon Gibian, and
[37:20] now moon in the valley of Ajalon.
[37:24] Now, just thinking of that
[37:28] and trying I'm trying to dramatize it or
[37:30] usually I do this little play in my head
[37:33] and I'm placing me myself there, you
[37:34] know, like Josh Joshua and Caleb or
[37:36] Joshua with the captain of the host. Now
[37:39] he's busy fighting and he's asking his
[37:42] soldiers, "Boys, we're winning. I can
[37:45] see we we're on the front foot. What do
[37:47] we need? Do we need more weapons? Do we
[37:49] need what do we what do we need to and
[37:51] and and the soldiers maybe in one accord
[37:54] I don't know they go we just need time
[37:57] we just need time can we just win some
[37:59] time now place yourself now he's
[38:03] standing and he's saying that in the
[38:05] midst of Israel so in the sight of
[38:07] Israel sun stand still and moon in the
[38:11] valley of Agelon what would have gone
[38:14] through the soldiers heads while they
[38:17] chopping you Amorites or whoever they
[38:20] were fighting at that point. What what
[38:22] what would the thought have been? Like
[38:24] did he really just say that?
[38:27] But I feel there's there's a little bit
[38:30] more to this because
[38:32] this is now a a son of God. He is a
[38:35] saint. He's surrendered. He's seeing the
[38:39] victory. This is physical. Remember, we
[38:42] are looking at God. So, we're looking
[38:43] spiritually to our victories. We've won.
[38:47] And we looked back and said, "Lord, but
[38:49] you've never failed from 2011, 2012,
[38:52] 2013. Here I stand. Here I am. What am I
[38:54] doing here? Without you, I would not
[38:56] have been here."
[38:58] &gt;&gt; So with that authority is saying, "Okay,
[39:00] let's go back to what I said in the
[39:02] beginning. That fire that's within you."
[39:05] So if it's a if it's a ever consuming
[39:07] fire, if it's always burning, it'll
[39:09] never run out. You're going back to God.
[39:12] It means you are forever. It means you
[39:14] are eternal.
[39:16] And he is speaking that from that
[39:18] authority is saying but if I am beyond
[39:21] this veil if I am beyond this time
[39:25] I can say this because I'm a righteous
[39:27] son of God
[39:30] and what the Bible says
[39:32] and the sun stood still and the moon
[39:34] stayed until the people had avenged
[39:36] themselves upon their en enemies. Is it
[39:39] not written in the book of Jasher? So
[39:42] the sun stood still in the midst of
[39:43] heaven and hasted not to go down about a
[39:46] whole day.
[39:48] And you can go ask the science
[39:50] scientists and they start going back.
[39:53] They go, "Well, something happened
[39:55] somewhere cuz we've got a glitch in the
[39:57] system." So-called glitch.
[40:00] So that was um I just find that
[40:03] fascinating that
[40:06] Joshua didn't limit what he asked God
[40:09] and Joshua had the liberty and freedom
[40:12] to say I mean we we are saying the Bible
[40:15] is saying if you want to move this
[40:17] mountain you can
[40:19] &gt;&gt; right and here he goes well okay I'll go
[40:21] one step further if I can move this
[40:22] mountain why can I not make the sun
[40:25] stand still
[40:27] and in this time of darkness maybe we
[40:29] should make the sun stand still, forget
[40:31] about time.
[40:34] And the Lord appeared unto him in the
[40:36] plains of memory. And he sat in the tent
[40:39] of the heat of the day, and lift up his
[40:41] eyes, and looked, and lo, three men
[40:43] stood by him. And when he saw them, he
[40:46] ran to them from the tent door and bowed
[40:49] himself to out to the ground and said,
[40:51] "And this is all familiar that we know.
[40:53] My Lord, if thou have found favor in thy
[40:56] sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from
[40:58] thy servant. Let a little water, I pray
[41:01] you, be fetched, and wash your feet and
[41:03] rest yourselves under the tree."
[41:07] Was so nice. Back in the day, we would
[41:09] have had time. There was no rush. There
[41:11] was no, it could have been a hard time
[41:14] for for Abraham back then because it um
[41:17] it was in the heat of the day, so to
[41:19] say. And I will fetch a morsel of bread
[41:22] and comfort you your hearts. After that
[41:25] ye shall pass on,
[41:27] for therefore if uh are ye come to your
[41:29] servant, and they said, So do as thou
[41:32] hast said. And Abraham hastened into the
[41:35] tent unto Sarah and said, "Make ready,"
[41:37] there's I can point to her name is now
[41:41] already Sarah and not Sari.
[41:44] Um, make ready quickly three measures of
[41:46] the fine meal needed and make cakes upon
[41:48] the earth. And Abraham ran into the herd
[41:51] and fetched a calf tender and good and
[41:53] gave it to a young lad and he hasted to
[41:56] dress it. Now hold on. So here comes
[41:59] someone. How long does it take to dress
[42:01] a cow? Who's who can tell me that?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; It's it's not a quick uh quick thing. We
[42:06] can maybe do the bread in a in a few
[42:09] moments in the in the oven or on the
[42:11] fireplace, do some uh do some
[42:13] briberikis. That's easy. But to go and
[42:16] fetch a live cow livestock and then
[42:19] dress that, that takes time. And here
[42:22] the Lord was sitting down and he had
[42:26] time. So we know what happens after this
[42:28] fact. We know sort of why did he come
[42:31] here? Yes, he came. He sat with Abraham.
[42:34] This he he he he he showed his
[42:36] servantthood. He showed his humbleness.
[42:38] He washed their feets their feet. But he
[42:41] knew that after that, you know, Lot was
[42:43] still a bit of an issue at that at this
[42:45] time. And then he would be become father
[42:49] of nations after this. And all that was
[42:52] outside of time. All this Sarah was
[42:56] laughing in the tent. So, how how how
[43:00] can I be how can I bring pleasure to my
[43:02] to my uh husband and I'm 99 years old or
[43:06] 90 years old? Um,
[43:09] time is not is no more for the Lord.
[43:12] Time, he's waiting for that. He's
[43:14] waiting for faith to brew. He's waiting
[43:16] for something to click into action. He's
[43:19] looking at you. He's not looking at the
[43:21] time piece. You are maybe his time
[43:23] piece, if I can say that reverently.
[43:29] John, these things said he uh and after
[43:34] that he said unto them, our friend
[43:36] Lazarus sleepeth. Now Jesus talking to
[43:38] his disciples,
[43:40] but I go. So I just want to accentuate
[43:43] that I go that I may awake him from the
[43:46] sleep. So again there's a motion,
[43:48] there's a obedience that he's seeing
[43:51] Jesus of Nazareth and he's seeing I need
[43:54] to go. So now his disciples are going,
[43:56] "Oh, if he sleeps, he shall do well."
[44:00] Now Jesus need to explain himself. How
[44:02] be it Jesus spake of his death? But they
[44:04] thought that he'd spoken just he's
[44:06] having a rest and sleep. Then he just
[44:09] told them plainly, "Lads, yes, Lazarus
[44:12] is actually dead. So that's why I need
[44:14] to go. But because of this, I am glad
[44:18] for your sake that I was not there to
[44:21] the intent ye may believe. Nevertheless,
[44:23] let us go unto him. So,
[44:26] I think the Lord waited for that fourth
[44:28] day. I think the Lord said, I will I can
[44:31] restore all things. And again, time is
[44:33] no time is not a limitation for me. I'm
[44:36] sitting outside of this and I will I
[44:38] will show you.
[44:41] And with that, I will show you what I
[44:43] will leave behind with you when he when
[44:47] he left this earth.
[44:50] Now, here's a little bit of a turning
[44:51] point. Um, we listen to the to the um
[44:57] New Year's
[44:58] uh Eve testimonies and songs. We've been
[45:02] going through them and and and Sister
[45:04] Shannon, you said in your testimony that
[45:07] in I think it was the White River
[45:09] rafting, he said he remembered. And it
[45:12] was just so beautiful. It just hit me
[45:14] that the Lord is mindful. He's the
[45:17] master of perfect planning. Hope that's
[45:20] not my device. The Lord is so mindful.
[45:23] And that's one thing that we can
[45:24] probably say is that beyond time and
[45:27] beyond space or wherever, the Lord is
[45:30] mindful. So he will always keep in
[45:32] remembrance. He will always hear your
[45:34] heart. He will always see that prayer.
[45:39] So I want to give a little bit of a
[45:41] context here.
[45:42] So
[45:45] this is the seven peaks. Um they call it
[45:49] also the the Brandon peaks. Now leading
[45:52] up to this point, brother Brandham had a
[45:54] bit of a sort of a a rough time with
[45:57] with the businessmen and the ministers
[46:00] and he said, "Oh, he just want to go and
[46:02] leave it all again." He had that dream
[46:04] of his brother-in-law being a bum and
[46:06] and all that thing. So he was quite, you
[46:09] know, um, I guess unsettled
[46:11] and he's now driving back, I think, from
[46:14] Canada.
[46:17] And now here is what it said. Now, this
[46:20] is brother Brham. He says, "Because uh,
[46:22] this is the Lord speaking to brother
[46:23] Brandon. Because thou chosen the narrow
[46:25] path, the harder way, thou was walked in
[46:29] your own choosing." Now color in that
[46:31] picture while you're looking at and
[46:32] while you're listening. Color in that
[46:34] picture. Make yourself stand there next
[46:36] to him. Now I can see that Moses had to
[46:39] make a choice too. See thou has picked
[46:41] the precise and correct way, correct
[46:43] decision and it is my way underlined my
[46:47] way. The Holy Spirit speaking back
[46:50] because of this momentous decision, a
[46:53] huge portion of heaven awaits you. See
[46:57] now what a glorious decision. What a
[47:00] glorious decision thou has made. this in
[47:03] itself that which will make and come to
[47:05] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[47:08] divine. Now here as well there was a
[47:11] interpretation of a prophecy that went
[47:14] forth and the the person that spoke in
[47:17] tongues was actually speaking fluently
[47:20] in French. That was that little Baptist
[47:22] boy.
[47:23] Now the verb be before the adverb so
[47:26] love divine that's in French. Now the UN
[47:29] interpret interpret that and that the
[47:32] boy knows not one word never heard never
[47:34] heard such a thing as speaking in
[47:36] tongues. He was a Baptist just happened
[47:38] to drop in there heard that music and
[47:40] said come up there and stand by uh stand
[47:43] up there and listen to me preach or at
[47:45] me preach
[47:47] now in the love divine divine love. How
[47:50] can that be divine love if it isn't the
[47:52] Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is divine
[47:55] love. Now, as Billy and I started to go
[47:57] down the road, now here they traveling,
[47:59] starting going um on the road, Billy
[48:02] went to sleep again, and it said it said
[48:05] the L, the angel of the Lord, I'll give
[48:07] you an everlasting sign. And I said,
[48:10] Lord, Lord, what? And he waited a little
[48:12] bit and nothing happened. And I said,
[48:14] "What is the everlasting sign, Lord?"
[48:16] And I waited a few minutes. And just
[48:19] then I looked over to see Billy. He was
[48:21] still asleep. And he said, "I'll give
[48:23] you an everlasting sign again." And he
[48:25] said, "Look westward from where you at."
[48:29] And I turned my head like this in the
[48:31] truck and to look and slow down, you
[48:33] know. And oh my, the spirit of the Lord,
[48:35] it felt like I could scream and cry and
[48:37] looked and I was saw a mountain with
[48:39] white caps on it. Now he's feeling that
[48:42] presence in that atmosphere. He's still
[48:44] not seeing what we're seeing and what we
[48:46] think he should see. I don't know. I see
[48:48] no everlasting sign about this. He said,
[48:51] "Your name is written wrote all over
[48:53] it." I thought what is that? I got real
[48:56] weak and start stopping. So now he's
[48:58] he's pulling over just, you know, he's
[49:01] getting weak because of that of that
[49:03] atmosphere of the Lord of the angel of
[49:06] the Lord. Now it was quite nice cuz
[49:09] brother Mess was talking about look and
[49:11] live. Now here he's looking but he's not
[49:14] seeing. So he's trying to see. He's
[49:15] trying to look. What am I looking at?
[49:17] We're just looking at it wrongly. you
[49:18] know, we just just misinterpreted the
[49:21] the what what the Lord's trying to say
[49:24] now with the car stopping. Billy raised
[49:27] up and he said, "What's the matter with
[49:29] you?" And I I pulled my hands in like
[49:30] this, perspirating, dropping off my hand
[49:33] and it's snowing. I said, "Billy,
[49:35] something's happening. At one time, I
[49:37] know where I've gone wrong or done
[49:39] wrong. I know that I failed God." This
[49:42] is now Brother Brandham's talking. And
[49:44] it looked like, now I think this is a
[49:46] vision. I could hear that song being
[49:48] sung and see thousands of mixed people,
[49:51] lame, whole, blind, withered. Heard a
[49:54] choir, a voice of some great renowned
[49:57] voice singing, "Unclean, unclean, the
[50:00] evil spirits drove him."
[50:03] Then Jesus came and set the captives
[50:05] free. I could see the sick lines laying
[50:08] lying everywhere and I had to stop.
[50:10] Billy didn't know what was going to take
[50:12] place. And I looked up. I saw and I
[50:15] looked up on the mountain and I seen
[50:18] those seven hills. Now here, if you want
[50:21] to see something, there's seven peaks on
[50:23] top of a mountain. One mountain that run
[50:25] for several miles. And the last mountain
[50:28] before you go into the other country, no
[50:30] more mountains after that. And it was
[50:32] running from east to west. The mountain
[50:34] set in was snowcapped on top. And the
[50:38] first two small caps or peaks and then a
[50:41] large large peak and then another small
[50:43] peak and then a larger peak and then a
[50:46] small peak great large long snowcap
[50:48] mountain. And I said Lord I do not
[50:50] understand what this means. He said how
[50:53] many peaks are there? And I said there's
[50:55] seven. And how many letters in your
[50:57] name? And he spells his name first name
[51:00] his middle name. It's all seven. And
[51:03] there was three outstanding pigs. So a
[51:06] peaks just I assume in front of it.
[51:10] Those three peaks are the first, second
[51:11] and third pool. The first was from the
[51:14] first part of your ministry, a small
[51:16] hill and then your first pool pretty
[51:17] high, you know, sign in the hand. And
[51:20] then there was a little interval in
[51:22] there, the time that I was sp taken off
[51:25] from being too tired. Many of you
[51:26] remember that. And then that came the
[51:28] discernment, the second pool. Now I've
[51:31] had another about a few years there.
[51:33] Here just kind of little peaks. See uh
[51:36] back like my ministry wasn't yet. And
[51:39] then come to the third one. See three is
[51:42] number of completion. See the third one.
[51:44] The peak was five number of grace. And
[51:47] the next peak was seven. A number of
[51:50] completion or perfection. The end. Six
[51:53] days you shall labor. The seventh is the
[51:56] Sabbath. The end of the week. The end
[51:58] time. See. And I stopped and I showed it
[52:00] to Billy and looked at them. He said,
[52:04] "Now let that stand. If there's ever a
[52:07] doubt in your mind, remember this place
[52:09] and come back here." Now, I want to say
[52:12] with that, remember this place. Remember
[52:14] your date. Remember your baptism.
[52:16] Remember that still small voice.
[52:18] Remember when you received the
[52:20] interpretation of the of speaking in
[52:22] tongues and it's it was for you.
[52:24] Remember that place that you can come
[52:26] back to that.
[52:30] Um, if I may, I'll call the musicians up
[52:34] and then I'll I'll I'll end with this.
[52:38] Now, outside
[52:40] of space, time, and matter. Now, this
[52:43] was my original thought. Attaching to
[52:46] someone that is outside of all these
[52:49] things that won't die, that won't move
[52:53] away, that will not change. That's where
[52:56] I have my comfort and security.
[52:59] It does not take IQ to know God. It
[53:02] takes the I am himself to bring
[53:05] revelation. And remember, his ways are
[53:08] not our ways. His thoughts are not our
[53:10] thoughts. And his time is not our time.
[53:16] Second to last slide. No matter what the
[53:19] bra brom tabernacle, no matter what the
[53:22] shikina tabernacle
[53:25] ever turns to be, don't you let it be
[53:27] you. You be a servant to Christ. No
[53:30] matter what the church world does, you
[53:32] be a servant to Christ. It's not up to
[53:35] the brand tabernacle. Neither is it up
[53:38] to any other church. It's up to you as
[53:41] an individual to be ready at the coming
[53:44] of the Lord. You must be ready. I must
[53:47] be ready. I'll sweep my own steps. It's
[53:50] up to you to sweep your steps. Leave
[53:52] mine alone. Me leave yours alone. You've
[53:55] got to make your garment ready.
[53:58] And I just thought to lay it on my heart
[54:01] to add this um this final slide in
[54:04] remembrance of our one of our later or
[54:08] more recent um
[54:11] promises that we received.
[54:14] I have spoken unto you this night. Do
[54:16] not fear. Believe my word. Have faith
[54:19] and believe. Nowhere there the Lord is
[54:21] mentioning time. If you knew what lay
[54:24] beyond the veil, you would rejoice in
[54:26] the fire as I would see uh what it
[54:30] delivers you from and you would
[54:32] volunteer for it. Rest in the trial.
[54:35] Don't fear. Fear bring uh fear gives
[54:38] power to the enemy, but faith brings
[54:41] deliverance.
[54:43] Amen. I want to encourage you with those
[54:45] words that uh this this is thus sayeth
[54:48] the Lord. This is what it's come and I
[54:52] believe it. I believe it. It's for me,
[54:54] for my household. Um we've got this on
[54:58] our on our bedroom wall. Um and we are
[55:03] we are looking beyond time. We're
[55:06] looking just towards him. Just look at
[55:08] God. Don't worry about what's going on
[55:11] around you. There's a lot of things and
[55:13] and and I can say that 2026 is is a year
[55:17] where something big will come. We always
[55:19] maybe say that, but I believe it.
[55:21] Something's going to change. Something's
[55:23] got to change. We're going up. So, take
[55:26] that step. Listen to that still small
[55:29] voice. Just do it. Amen. Amen. Okay.
[55:35] Let's uh let's sing that song that I
[55:38] wanted to sing. Would that be good?
[55:41] Thank you.
[55:43] And then I'll call up brother Ben.
[55:54] Oh, I know the time is near where
[55:58] everything that I hold dear will lay
[56:03] before the holy
[56:06] consuming
[56:08] fire.
[56:10] All my works and all my deeds,
[56:14] every present on my knees, lay before
[56:21] me to make fire.
[56:26] All I want to see
[56:30] is Jesus.
[56:34] All I want to see
[56:38] is him in me.
[56:42] All I want to see is Jesus
[56:50] shine
[56:54] through.
[56:58] Oh, I know the time is near.
[57:02] Everything that I hold dear will lay
[57:07] before the whole
[57:10] consuming
[57:11] fire.
[57:14] Words of knowledge in his name. Healing
[57:19] has touched the lane. Lay before
[57:26] to make fire.
[57:30] All I want to see is Jesus.
[57:37] All I want to see
[57:41] is him in me.
[57:45] All I want to see is Jesus
[57:53] shine
[57:56] to me and here and here and say
[58:31] All I want to see is Jesus.
[58:39] All I want to see
[58:42] is
[58:44] me.
[58:46] All I want to see is Jesus
[58:54] shine
[58:57] through me.
[59:02] Amen. Aren't you glad God sees
[59:06] outside? He lives outside of time. What
[59:08] is time to him? He sees the end. He
[59:12] doesn't see the now. He sees the end.
[59:14] That's why the Lord Jesus, he had a joy
[59:16] set before him, which is what was going
[59:18] to end up in eternity, us redeemed
[59:20] around the throne. Praise the Lord. So,
[59:23] I think we should just take hold of
[59:24] God's eternal promises and let God live
[59:28] and don't worry. Just worry never
[59:30] delivered anyone, but faith brings
[59:32] deliverance. Amen. So, praise go. Praise
[59:36] the Lord. Thank you, brother Ed. really
[59:37] appreciate that. Yeah, I was thinking
[59:39] about those, you know, those peaks. If
[59:40] you go Google Maps, they're actually
[59:42] called Brandon Peaks on Google Maps. I
[59:44] don't know how they got named that, but
[59:45] they got named that. You think about
[59:47] ecological, I mean, geological time. God
[59:50] had that before those, you know, those
[59:52] peaks, everything there. When, I don't
[59:54] know, but it was already there waiting
[59:56] for the prophet to drive by that way and
[59:58] the state he was in feeling down and
[1:00:00] worried, all those things. But God said,
[1:00:01] "No, I've given you an everlasting
[1:00:03] sign." Amen. There's more than what
[1:00:05] you're going through that matters. Look,
[1:00:06] look to the end. Amen. We must do the
[1:00:09] same. Praise the Lord. Amen. You can all
[1:00:11] have your seats uh tonight. Just going
[1:00:13] to go through the prayer requests and if
[1:00:15] there's any others then please um
[1:00:18] Amen. So scrolling here brother sisters.
[1:00:22] So uh sister tab asked prayer.
