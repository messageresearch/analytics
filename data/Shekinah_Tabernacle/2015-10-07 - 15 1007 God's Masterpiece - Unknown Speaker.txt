Christ's name Amen amen amen well it's wonderful to be gathered together it's good to see you all out tonight interest you've had a blessed week if you'd like to turn with being your Bibles to Genesis chapter 25 I just want to take two scriptures here that we've read that we can never really I've gone into any great detail when I continued my thought about where we are on the end time and that's good to have you Lana down town oh god bless you it's good to have you here they wonderful these past few days having you here thank you for being here pray you'll be blessed tonight and we'll just go to justice chapter so Jeff here's the chapter 24 I'm worried vs 64 and 65 and it's easier maybe we could read verse 63 as well and Isaac went out to meditate in the field of the Eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels will come in and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she left she lighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what manners us that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself and I saw an will just read the last of us and the server told Isaac all the things that he had done and Isaac brought her into his mother series 10 and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's dear I'm in may the lord blesses would you may have your seat now I'd like to take a portion of that just that verse there verse 65 where she says who is this he says she says what manners us that walketh in the field to meet us because you know as we were talking about on Sunday we see how the man of sin has been revealed in the stay but he is not really the main main one we're looking for because we have seen in this time that yo we we're in a season where where we are going to be with the Lord during the season of the catching away the bride Ernie and we see that you know owl because we understand this book of Genesis here this chapter of Genesis is a shadow of what we're living out and we understand that Isaac as a as a type of Christ he was he was the lamb that that Abraham was going to offer on on the altar he gave himself willingly and he was the promised son as Jesus is the promised son and we see Rebecca she she represents us in the US in the scripture where there's a there's a there's a called out people that become one with Jesus Christ and so there comes a time now where Rebecca finally laser eyes upon Isaac and she begins to ask who is this man that comes out to meet us and we see that as the church has walked two thousand years that finally Christ has become more of a living reality today and and it says in the scripture if we can go to 2nd Timothy we're young we begin to read we're sorry buddies find them my notes we begin to read where Paul speaks about a crown of life is laid up for him and if we go to second Timothy chapter 4 we go we reach this where you know second Timothy chapter 4 and verse a seven and eight and paula's Paula speaking Paul is speaking to Timothy because he understands that his thursday's upon the earth are numbered and he's his finishes course he says I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith therefore there is a crown laid up at can you turn this down please a henceforth there is a crown laid up for me there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all of them also that love his appearing and we can see that as God has become what he has done in this end time as he has made here's he has begun to appear among us you know you see in the Ministry of the prophet of the Lord where God would come down and the services and people would say Bible days are here again and the sucker healed enough and in the very hearts of the people's lives were revealed in front of him and and the pillar of fire God Himself was was photographed there in the services of even as biggest critics there about the presence of that of that great God Himself Jesus Christ and they knew that he was there and that was God now was beginning to appear about his people and we see that even down 50-yard years down the road we should really ask the question who is this man amen who is this who is this unseen one that we feel among us not just every service but but in our homes who's this one who walks with us who is this great one I mean who is this unseen oneness this very king of glory that is that makes himself known among us a man that is that your comes our way Eddie Eddie and he heals the sick a many others the eyes of the blind and many quickens is worth to us amen he annoys us to to to live the scripture I mean who is this who is this man I'm sure you can see that as as time has gone on I trusted your Christian walk and Jesus Christ has become more real to you becoming brighter living reality as he has begin to appear among us and it's more than just now way just an introduction or maybe just hearing of him but now your eyes have actually fallen upon them because we understand that when the word is it becomes a living reality that is Jesus Christ benefiting himself and is when we see his would become manifest we can actually say we have seen Jesus project they met an end you know we we can say by the authority of God's what we have seen him amen we jaw is a time a week for physically meet him in the air and we know now was not yet that time but his spirit is working among us I'm in that very unseen one that was walking on the shores of Galilee in a body of flesh this is a little while and the World's End we know more but you shall see me he says I personal pronoun will be with you even in you to the end of the world this is all nothing if you come from list but I'll be with you guys pc and he's not saying a separate personal being one of you I myself a mental be worth you will be walking with you and we understand that this very God is you know this unseen one I trust you really think about it as you are every day that cause this one this is one that is that has turned my heart to serve Him who is this one that has changed me I mean who is this the book of Genesis that you know in the paul writing the book of Hebrews he says that Jesus Christ is him as the image of the invisible God and everything that you're the fool disregarded widely dwelt in Jesus Christ and we can see from the scripture that that God was reflecting himself through the prophets in part but then finally all that god was he caught himself into Jesus Christ and brother branham he would he would speak of a speak of a great sculpture and thus great sculpture was this sculpture of Moses and Michelangelo who was a great great artist in his day he he spent many years stop thickness first sculpture of Moses out of one piece of marble and and and a replica of this was was was made because the real ones in the Vatican but a replica was made and it was put in the forest lawn cemetery in the United States a lot of famous people are ya you know be readin and at brother bran would tell the story when he went to that cemetery and he saw the grave of aimee semple mcpherson the start of the 4th quit denomination and he went there and just gave thanks you know for her life and he on the work she did and then they said do you want to have a tour around around the cemetery and and and and that was showing of different grades of different famous people and then finally he saw this he saw this yo sculpture of Moses and and he would begin to look at that sculpture and you know that sculpture is very interesting to cause on on one of his thing Levinson's right knee there's a there's a chip out of its right knee and what and and the story goes that Michael enter he had was buying he had in his mind what what Moses should look like you know every artist has inspiration and and finally you know after many years of toiling and and here and and sculpting and shaping that piece of marble finally finally after many years in prison go he would look at look at his sports and what he mentioned his mind and become material and go go in front of it and he was so inspired so caught up with what his very thoughts had become material that he took the hammer he cried out speak because he thought life was in it and he struck the thing on the knee and and and there's a chip out of the need to the state because of that and brother branham said that the masterpiece because this was called Michelangelo's masterpieces brother branham would look at that sculptured he'd say a floor and the need is what made of the master it wasn't it wasn't how big Moses was how muscly was and you know order you know it's quite an incredible piece of work if you go away and Google effect by the Prophet didn't look at look at how great the sculpture was Greece hit the floor you know that marking the knee is what made it a masterpiece to her and because Michelangelo he was he was so inspired he believed life was in that thing he believed all he had to do was strike hit it who come to life and it would speak to him and that's why he struck it and and we see that a god through the Old Testament he was he was molding he was reflecting himself with Moses the lawgiver which was Christ revealing a part of himself you know he was in Joshua placing the people in the land and and and we see Jesus Christ and Joseph is a perfect type where you know he was he was spiritual and he was hated by his brethren and you know he'll solve for 30 pieces of silver and you know he was he was put in prison and you know yo the you know the butler died and then the outside you know the Baker died the butler was given us life just like Jesus Christ was on the cross and one thing was part into one thing with the hell and you know all these things and kind in finding he was exalted to the right hand of fear that at every need and then we Joseph can't down the street every knee had to battle Joseph it that's the same thing with our Lord that one day every knee must bow to the name of Jesus Christ and so we can see Jesus Christ and Joseph we can see him and David is who you are as a rejected King we can see him in Moses but you see him in Jeremiah all the prophets down all the way we can see him and then finally all of those reflections were gathered together then finally better the man Jesus Christ and so God was sculpting and shaping and then finally his very idea of the ideal man I mean you know more than just a prophet or more than just a king but here was the man thank God was going to come in flesh and he was going to represent to us at what a Christian should be and how Christian should should conduct themselves and and God was so just like Michelangelo he was so he was so inspired and so happy with body his thoughts had become flesh you know we understand that the Bible tells us the work from finish from the foundation of the world and God has seen even even Snoddy seen it played out in his mind and he knows the end from the beginning but it's one thing but yo yes just like us we think about something you know like we want to go do something and we planted in our mind and maybe we make reservations and we bought plane tickets and we do all these things but then finally win what you imagined has looked out in u.s. experiences or the wonderful thing and then finally God now he can see you know he can see what he had in his mind had become flesh amen and then finally he saw this one this goes this great masterpiece that he made and he was so inspired by what he saw thee that he hug him up on Calgary amen any causes a bit bruised and cause them to be wounded amen and just like the Prophet said now the floor and the knee is what made in the masterpiece now Jesus Jesus looked like any man he looked like a common man near the Bible cows and Isaiah chapter 53 that there was nothing over there when we we should desire me or some big handsome guy he wasn't some big blind six foot tall short yo a broad shoulder kind of guy here's a small little fella I mean he doesn't have any you know any physical formula think this is the king of Israel but there was a life of them that was different to every other member yo get it even walk upon the air we everyman thing that can't you see every other man and they felt Moses fell he he had his temporary structure requires your David felt you know even your even and her sincerity he said I'll never seen yo I keep the wood hand and my heart but I said not against go aboard and you know he had this great desire that he wanted yo I keep the law ever before my face and all these things he wrote those things down he was genuine and us and his belief but the thing is if a man is not you know if a person is not truly converted not you're truly not born again when sin comes their way temptation comes their way all that will be laid aside and their and their human natural try and grab try and grab that thing and we can see that in the life of Bathsheba now i mean- achiever here the sincere desire to serve god but then as soon as she he saw Bathsheba that all went to one side and he took what he wanted for that so every man fell and now here was a man who is a very different kind of man he had a hit an unusual we're you know we're we're a little virgin you know ladyhood could Isaiah go the prophecy big red maybe one day on yo baby one day the synagogue and a spoke to her heart of the kid a visitation of an angel and in the woods that prophet anchored into a room and then life came forth and get a very different kind of life and and the devil came against him in the deal had to retreat he could make us 14 and it's because there was a life in him there's a life of him that was being expressed at never a man speak like this man I mean ever a man took a took a kid's lunch yeah i took some loaves and fishes and we get to multiply the bread or multiply the fishes in it and it wasn't just fish was cooked fish mother's friends cook friend and he any fit fit thousands of people at a time every man had done these things every man and Pat had looked upon water like he did or curse the victorious to the store more yeah I never a man had done these kind of things and then finally finally now here was God's masterpiece and sleep now brother branham he says member the floor and what made the masterpiece it was you know I mean I mean you know is the mark underneath the floor that's what made the masterpiece now masterpiece I hope I can convey dusty it's not but wonder stand that God has interviewed antenna mr. being Gila as to being King and mr. be a savior a judge a priest a lamb all these things are in him but they can only be fully manifested when they put on flesh we see that young and the old testament there was the brass super because you are raised up and they look at that thinking that be healed without offer a lamb and this has been covered but and to all those who attributes of God being looked out in those things but only when thou fully put on flesh dad people could truly be heal the people would truly be safe from their sermon your people could truly be delivered when those attributes put on flesh and but those attributes were were were sealed up in a body amen all those things were sealed up in him and so there had to be something had to be done to release those things that the people could truly access in the way God and so down Jesus now he had to because he was our lamb he was he was our lamb he had to be offered you know here to be examined and he was found perfect party don't know yeah I can find no fault in thee and then finally he was you know by His stripes you know to the wounding of him by the word against him it was that was now that was now the chips off his back was now the floors now amen that now made him a real real masterpiece you understand because now there was a way that because he was emptying himself out I mean that without money or price people could receive eternal life people could receive healing I mean people could receive deliverance so now it was it was the floor and then his work that made of the masterpiece hey you're following me this all right I mean you understand what I'm saying it's just words but now the question is so now the question is what caused the wound what caused the words you say well as the Romans and their work all these things that that didn't cause the words amen that doesn't pause the world they cause the ones in a sense that they were used to cause the ones but they weren't the ultimate cause of the world you see what caused the world sit across the world amen then I can say what else cause the word you cause the word Amen when you look at him hanging on Calvary have you imagined it in your mind and in you cause those words you're the reason he went to Calvary you're the reason the wounds will cause not because of anyone asks you're the reason I mean you're the reason aside was river you're the reason that he did that he was mad beyond any other man cuz her life in there that had to be released and it was released for you I mean you lost the woods hallelujah you're the reason the higher on Calvary and his words made of the masterpiece they meant without you he couldn't be the true masterpiece why cuz there's a people you say why did he have to go there because there are some people that were born and son I mean the whole human race was in jail and they had to be set free and I think God could come down and pay the price and then not a prophet or not Moses or not enlarge or whoever it was but God had to become man he had to become our land amen that he could play the price that a life could be released out of him but the only way his life could be released out as that there was a wounding a min because blood had to be shared without the shedding of blood is no remission of sin amen see all the ones who called you're the reason he was wounded hallelujah I'm so glad he was wounded for me amen he was the he was the reason I mean you reason many high on Calvary because there was a life in him it had to be released and life had to be released they're coming to you and when it came into you God was saying i see no fault in these people i mean there are sinless people a man there they're covered by the blood hallelujah because he says a citizen hebrews chapter 24 as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah so he took object I mean he took the form of man and he used it to yo that he would destroy the diplom self hallelujah Sinell now he is the master piece hanging on Calvary and his life was released and then 222 coming to a people and to transform those people Amen because now when we you know when when Rebecca now saw so Isaac come out out to out to meet her now you know gee that's was you know she didn't know Isaac it is a lamp no Isaac was the land that that that Abraham would have offered now and then now I just want to jump however many thousand years from that meeting go down to this day I mean where we see that yo we have advised two thousand years of Neil's of time now where we have we read in Revelations four and five we're now there's a call went for who is worthy to take the book who's worthy to make redemptions place who is worthy to buy back this this this this lost creation and john looked he said no man was found worthy here's up in heaven and he couldn't see any man worthy angel who were these sure they were but there's no man he could see and he begin to week because he realized that no one was was found worthy to take that book and to loose the seals and then and to you know to give what the contents of the book was and though almost found worthy and all oppression was in jeopardy he saw Jesus died on the cross I mean he saw the wooden of the Lamb he received that same life that was in him came into her so he experienced your salvation how's your health to be experienced but then when he couldn't see anyone worthy now to take you know to take the book and then finally if you're one of the elders said we've not job for the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's been found worthy and then when he turned he saw Lamech stepped forth out of the eternities he could have said who is this laughs I mean who is this land that comes to meet me and here comes the land and we understand that lamb is Jesus Christ the only worthy one that had the right through her intentions plain bored I mean so then he then he took that book hallelujah he made in his own position he made it he made a part of his belongings I Louie he paid the price on Calvary when I she is now going to redeem everything now i'm going to lay claim a buffalo new to me maybe so now John begin to see a lamb advance from eternity because out you know program tells us he was in de seating in the eternity but now he advances falls into the vision amen to take the book and then we see now that he has done those sexy advance here's advice now from the eternities into the vision and job can see him now take that book hallelujah and then so finally you know we must understand that John is a symbol in the book as well I mean Giada's assemble in the book when here the you know the church ages has lifted up into heaven that is the bride brother brad says one man and a vision represents a whole group of people so John has taken up into heaven and that speaks of the rapture of the bride at the end of the ages of it I'm it's a job now as a symbol there in that scene Alleluia so then finally he sees the land step 4 I need to make redemptions place and then we can see now that that same that same scene of the land stepping forth to make claims now remember it's all symbolic but it has to be looked out as well I mean we've seen I trust you can say I've seen the lamb step forth and then I've seen the lab step forth and lay claim to me hallelujah because when when Jesus comes in and he speaks to your heart and Eddie and he tries to get up i wants to get ahold of you and you maybe feel conviction come upon you and you give yourself to him you want a seven with all of your life that is a land coming to make claim to you I mean saying you belong to me once you belong to the devil but you would never mean to belong to the new and in once you belong to this world but you don't belong to this world you belong to the last room and then we need to recognize who we belong to doesn't matter what happens in life and where we go and walk on bars us and all these things if we know where we're from and if we know who we belong to and if there's something in us is I want to serve God you belong to the lab hallelujah amen so now we can say who is this great land because you know we don't know who Jesus was amen every church has its idea of who Jesus you can go no you go to every Church in your different organization in Wellington they have all different i did some say he's to some say he's three some say he's one son says he's a God of history some says he doesn't heal some says you know there's no millennium or rapture some say that you know run the millennium now some you're basically all kinds of thing something doesn't matter how you baptize some say you're going to be baptized by sprinkling Thomas is going to be baptized as a baby something at baptized amber Lord Jesus Christ which is true but they all have different ideas ever Jesus is the work in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so Jesus is his words we had no here we had no idea who is this laughs I heard a story of him he died on on across two thousand years ago but who is he I mean it one has her own idea but we don't worship God on our ideas we worship focus he's revealed himself away that's how we worship God and then so finally find Lisa got sit in the same time I'm going to declare myself I'm going to make myself known the lamb is going to step 4 amen and this is what happened in the same time where programs here now if I be assumed of God and if I told the truth let him come forth now prove that it's true and I've never heard anyone else say those things I mean but you said now by said if I be a servant of God you can switch you to the message of OBS it in front of thousands of people it just lays the challenge now I've said the truth and I be a servant of God let him come let the lamb come and self and prove that is true and God comes down have been the Cates it over and over again is the lamb saying this is me speaking this is not this man speaking this is me speak to you I trust this is not too strong but this out as a lamb declaring himself and then we and then we hear those pillows tape and for me Jesus came out of history by hearing those tapes that's why please listen to the tape and it listen to us messages so don't get all my job but just listen to it amen listen hey if you that's just like if you don't eat you'll starve and die you will if you donít eight you're going to stop and daughter hundred percent of the time I mean as a clayey church virtually it's true if I go try need out of a garbage can pretty much hundred percent of the time I'm going to get soup physically it's true spiritually it's church I meant you are what you eat amen so now he hates declared himself in this this man who is the smarty Landon's before amen it is our husband I mean if the bride groom himself amen that a step forth now so was the masterpiece member it was our the reason he was bad and wounded on Calvary's because of us and it because we he had to be wounded for us otherwise we could not receive a life that was in him because the blood without the shedding of blood is no remission Ursa so now because we had a neat because we had a knee he said that Elijah the Prophet because we had a knee I mean he revealed himself in the same time because we had a knee he walks among us I mean every day because we have a neat he walks so it's because of our floors now amen our failings amen helps them that cause them to be the masterpiece down and cause them to be the masterpiece today amen you know you understand what I'm saying he's the master piece of God and in our brother bear I'm just going to read the CCS now this is the see if I can read it see now after men had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and coming and might him and sit death in him still God was not willing this be defeated he came down and started all over again he was going to make that man again he began to rebuild now he began to rebuild the man through the Old Testament but then that was because the original masterpiece a needed now was Anna money and the woman and it's oh god now when he rebuilt when he revealed the man through the Old Testament hit the refillable woman and inside through the church ages now God has been rebuilding the woman has been rebuilding eat he has been finishing out the second part of the masterpiece amen and then now you see he was wounded the wounds made him the masterpiece I've been thinking about this this wounds made in the masterpiece and his words forced us to receive eternal life cause us to receive healing cause us to receive delivery has worked and then now if the master at that part of the masterpiece was mired in order that life could come forth now that's the same thing happens to us but not that we would give we don't have to die for salvation now I'm not saying that at all but you understand we receive wounding and marek that people can receive what's in us yeah now how does that work i'll give you the example she had me done and when brother branham he turned down the call to God the evangelistic field because he doesn't do his mother-in-law and then it ends up now that is and his wife is dying in the dying in the hospital or dead and then their little Sharon Rosie little girl as in you're dying of meningitis and you know you know he said when we know he's he'd go and pray for them and says like a black sheet would come down gold with his wooden are through the Press says little share rose her eyes would would cost because the pain she isn't before she was dying now that was a wounding that was a Maori and God used that because Brandon allows up to get better he said the law jumpa the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and then now when when when people would come in the prayer line before when God was present and he would pray the little kids and egg cross eyes not one of them left the platform with crossed eyes they all hundred these here came across and and eyes across and they came straight hundreds now and none of them knew what he had to endure for that to happen so now he was you understand one's own as my he was wounded he was mahi was scarred by these things and that was now used now that he could in turn to the person's burden he could enter into the person's name because you know when he you know it's just like when he was you know you're here when he know retails testimonies like the boy in Finland you know you know the two boys that got hurt in the car accident he is before he you know he had the vision of it happening and he told people throughout Canada United States write this on the Flyleaf for your Bible and and he relays the scene and then finally he's in Finland and the scenes being looked at in front of him and before he recognizes this is the boy this is the scene he says he says what if that was my little bully pool you know whenever whenever someone would come from your prayer your great need he wished think of his children or think of his family because he was entering into that person's need yeah and then we understand that the Lord said look again if you furthermore look at the particular model or the proxy is this not it and the crepe of the pointing came back to life amen but then all those things that happened to him it's because he is being wounded Jesus member the wounds made of the master be that the life of comfortable and it's now the same thing you say why do I have to go through why do I have to go through a certain thing and our great wounding and great scarring in great pain amen here brother Brennan when he tells the story of his wife first wife died and all these sick forgive me but maybe just telling in a different way but you know you hear him crying and he's getting deeply upset and hurt when he just recounts what happened to his wife and maybe because it was a wounding it was still a real real pain to him but God allowed those things to happen that now the life that was in him and it could be released to others because it'd be kind in terms of someone's need you can't really press them what they should be proud for a menu if you can't put yourself in their shoes and really look them up before God then you can't press them what they need to be grateful amen so now that's why you can go to your life so why did why did this happen to me and if God you because if you love to come along saying if God is really God why did he allow me to do this to you winds at asia's why did he allow this to happen you know and the whole reason these become a life into you amen God you that now his life you are going to be part of the identified masterpiece of God and God would use that user when you're struck when the great sculpture struck you allows you to be struck I should say I mean he allowed that to happen that when things come your way and people say / need praise me go over so you hear about this and you can really injure into their me and they may even know that you'll pray for them but you God lives that prayer and God will help that person what allowed you to be wounded that life because we are now that second we are the prime number all over the world down the true believers in God prior Jesus Christ as that as the restore t amen is the restored woman they make you go reiko yuuki the identify myself as a party with the cross mr. God reveal the physical union all these things whereas bixolon did they meant with a with a bride now coming for this a second part of their masterpiece Evan and brother Graham says now that Eve he says even was actually ordained to fall God you that it would happen it had caused it to happen but then but he allowed it to happen because he had to express is great redemption plan in that haven't looked out to heal out away that enemy could come and buy the whole thing so she was actually all danger for but then but then the Prophet tells us that this second if there's a day not to fall and then the sec the second Divas of things are standard test and then the second Divas of danger stand whatever the enemy can shoot at her Amen she'll stand the test hallelujah we're all day not to fall holy we're all dating to take a rapture friend he say will I fail every day that's why we have a lamb that's why we have luck I mean that's why we have an intercessor that's why we have a high priest then whatever the devil for us even if we do fall we say Lord forgive me and try me one more time Holloway that's why he stands it with his blood Alleluia we still have a lamb frequency level high priest they're still mercy amen well because where the blood is this mercy and is the blood hallelujah I mean that's why we have so you say I you know you can work is yourself and you can hate yourself remember you have a lamp and then you have a high priest that if you fall you can get back up again hallelujah so now that's why he is sure that's what he revealed himself with Hawaii has the same time he wants you to I am that man who is closest bandit that walks the waters of the field amen and now it's more than just now because the once upon a time it was now Eleazar I mean the server goober was a minister or the prophet or whoever was now introducing you Jesus Christ but then it goes now from from him introducing now in Isaak himself sets forth a me and he begins to show himself he because to declare himself our Lord Jesus and yet which is a secret had you know you've seen Rebecca's life once it was a secondhand story because our liaison was telling her about Isaac and then now finally she came amid Isaac and away from a second hey experience to a real experience a mint and that's why you just said you'd go just just listen to it I mean read the Bible listen to the message and just enjoy it because remember we you know sometimes we forget it's just like you know the ship but here's our great shepherd and he takes us through valleys he takes us over mountains he takes us through the fire he takes us through all kinds of things we remember the shepherd is present in an hour Isaac is always you know our Lord Jesus is always present and then you know whatever path we need to go through he's present and he allows all those things happened does because he wants to express himself and then in all different ways as a comforter who's had to be comforted and he had to show you first he had to show you that you needed company and then he came and comforted you who's been sick he's a healer who's been lost a man he's a savior amen who's who who's lost their way he's a guy he allows you to go through all those things because now I say favorite quotes but you know got this trouble that comes up walk with God the trouble in the church walk with God there trouble at home walk with God trouble in the world walk with god Amy just walk with God you say well I don't feel the whole bunch just walk with God I mean we don't walk according to our feelings so well he needs to come and meet me then I'll start serving to serve them anyway just walk with God amen and then watch what he'll do hallelujah no this is great one we need to really think about amen
