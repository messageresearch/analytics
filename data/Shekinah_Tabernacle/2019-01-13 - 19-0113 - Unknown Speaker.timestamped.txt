[8:58] amazing God the way that he can draw a
[9:01] man and a man can choose of his own free
[9:03] will and yet God has drawn him yes he
[9:06] can arrange circumstances and and soften
[9:11] hearts without it without how would you
[9:13] describe it without even touching the

[57:50] want I want they don't spoken anointing
[57:54] to speak for yourself because we are
[57:57] billboards for God you believe that
[58:00] all right so the prayer right now sure
[58:03] what was it was he what the prophets oh
[58:05] I forgot the the new face okay thank you
[58:11] so um so this morning I got the you know
[58:21] the family altar and they just God just
[58:24] spoke to me and I feel like I can share
[58:26] this force I'm sure you did read it as
[58:27] well but just - yeah thank you
[58:32] okay
[58:33] so so if we are going to serve the Lord
[58:36] it is now not tomorrow and to give the
[58:44] best we can while we can and when I read
[58:53] this - by my side could share with the
[58:55] church this morning so but I'm speaking
[59:04] so I appreciate all the singings the so
[59:08] we come together for this thank you for
[59:11] this single hour hike on the bless I had
[59:13] to come and you know look and you know
[59:17] hear the sons of God bless you for that
[59:19] yes Oprah said and now I come home just
[59:24] for a little rest
[59:25] I lost 20 pounds in this last meeting
[59:27] and by the measure and brother Dodd was
[59:30] up a while ago and said Robin I noticed
[59:33] that you do you put your whole heart
[59:36] into it and I said that's the only way
[59:40] you can do a right kind of a job for the
[59:43] Lord is to put everything you've got
[59:46] right into the forefront for Christ all
[59:51] your strength all your soul or your
[59:55] heart or your mind everything that you
[59:57] got when you are doing anything do it
[1:00:01] right or don't do it at all so it would
[1:00:05] be a Christian it was a Christian for
[1:00:07] the Lord or go to the world but for me I
[1:00:11] remember one way when we when I was in
[1:00:13] high
[1:00:13] have a very tough a single prefect he
[1:00:16] said we always say when you addresses
[1:00:18] the student it's either you do it or you
[1:00:21] do it right
[1:00:25] so it's either make Chris up or I'm a
[1:00:28] Christian so that's no place for the
[1:00:30] devil there's a lot so when you do
[1:00:35] anything do it right
[1:00:38] just or don't we see just leave it alone
[1:00:41] if you are going to be a Christian put
[1:00:45] everything you've got to Christ that's
[1:00:48] your time that's your talent your
[1:00:53] everything so if God give you time to
[1:00:56] think
[1:00:57] you think you put time to do it why

[1:01:04] anybody you are singing to defy the body
[1:01:08] praise the Lord I never know what that
[1:01:11] song we do to somebody there's a lot so
[1:01:16] I just not seen this young fella vibrato
[1:01:19] in squad
[1:01:21] that's your wife brother bones isn't it
[1:01:24] playing and singing they're that young
[1:01:27] couple and is it isn't a piano you know
[1:01:31] is it an organ was something kind of
[1:01:34] instrument this straw me time pick it
[1:01:37] and do something for the Lord if you
[1:01:40] could do that and sing and win souls do
[1:01:44] something no matter if you whistle can
[1:01:48] you imagine just me whistle why we're so
[1:01:56] just do something just to testify or to
[1:02:02] do something for the kingdom of God
[1:02:04] whatever you got put it to put it to use
[1:02:07] in God's service we appreciate that okay
[1:02:11] so um let us stand up it and turn to the
[1:02:15] scriptures
[1:02:20] okay so my the title of my hesitation
[1:02:27] this book this morning is here how we do
[1:02:30] continue city and now just really warned
[1:02:34] that I preached this message in upland
[1:02:37] and I thought to share with us after bow
[1:02:41] Isaac's message or Isaac yeah about the
[1:02:47] state of the of the world the economy
[1:02:50] and and it looks like where are we
[1:02:55] and it says something we have no place
[1:02:57] here I see a memorizing I have no place
[1:03:00] here but I have a kingdom have no
[1:03:04] producer here well praise the Lord
[1:03:08] okay so um I have four scriptures today
[1:03:12] this morning so Hebrews 13 12 to 14 and
[1:03:27] as problem we say if you gotta say Amen
[1:03:32] okay so I take it you got it
[1:03:34] okay so we're for Jesus also like him
[1:03:38] identify the people with his own blood
[1:03:41] suffered without the gate let us go
[1:03:47] forth therefore unto him without the
[1:03:50] camp bearing his reproach for here how
[1:03:55] bring a continued City but we seek one
[1:03:58] to come
[1:04:03] so second Corinthians chapter five just
[1:04:10] one verse for we know that if our
[1:04:20] earthly house or Vista markowitz
[1:04:23] dissolved we have a building of God and
[1:04:26] house not made with hands eternal in
[1:04:30] heavens
[1:04:33] join to the 14
[1:04:46] Oh verse 1 let your heart be troubled
[1:04:52] you believe in God believe also in me
[1:04:57] Christ said in my father's house are
[1:05:00] many mansions if it were not so I would
[1:05:03] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:05:06] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[1:05:10] for you I will come again for sure and
[1:05:15] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:05:18] there you may be also
[1:05:21] and finally scripture Luke 17
[1:05:38] likewise also as its what ideals of lot
[1:05:41] they did eat to drunk
[1:05:44] these BOTS the sold the planted they
[1:05:46] builded but the same day that lot went
[1:05:49] out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:05:51] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:05:54] all even thought that it'd be shall it
[1:05:58] be in the day when it's enough -
[1:06:00] revealed
[1:06:02] there's a lot may go up blessing to read
[1:06:05] Novus where in Jesus Christ's name may
[1:06:07] be seated us relax the Lord is here to
[1:06:15] give you your portion and I'm also
[1:06:18] looking for him to give my portion to
[1:06:20] praise the Lord
[1:06:22] okay so as a question is the world in
[1:06:30] southern condition today and the other
[1:06:36] question I didn't put easier easier is
[1:06:38] yet a way of escape there's a lot we
[1:06:43] just read in the scriptures all right so
[1:06:52] so when you see tsardom when you see
[1:06:57] sudden being replay today then you know
[1:07:03] that God's judgment upon the world is
[1:07:07] imminent and for the bride is home doing
[1:07:15] time glory to God and that's why the
[1:07:25] professor said in third Exodus and the
[1:07:30] most terrible condition that
[1:07:32] Christianity has ever lived in yesterday
[1:07:38] we write on the brain of or the brink of
[1:07:42] a great terrific judgment laying for the
[1:07:47] church
[1:07:48] and before this judgement can happen God
[1:07:51] is calling it's unethical going home
[1:07:55] time just like he did the ammo rising
[1:08:02] was was heaped up and so he's calling
[1:08:05] spiritual ethics now the promise said in
[1:08:15] a Semin when your eyes are open and I
[1:08:20] quote he says when all heaven is don't
[1:08:22] loose or hell based on loose so no
[1:08:28] wonder no wonder people walk around in
[1:08:35] rags and say it's fashion do you see
[1:08:37] them on the street when you go to the
[1:08:38] malls I when we a smile so think that's
[1:08:42] it Mad Men going racks right but today
[1:08:45] is fashion we put two going in torn
[1:08:47] clothes and in his fashion right today
[1:08:54] somebody say oh now um well I'm not sure
[1:08:59] what I'm a boy or girl right and don't
[1:09:06] you don't you don't even you dare to
[1:09:09] question or criticize them on the street
[1:09:13] you become what so now the right has
[1:09:18] become rock has become right um people
[1:09:23] are trying to normalize the abnormal
[1:09:28] would work know is that this little
[1:09:32] little reason why they are running mad
[1:09:34] and crazy yeah there's a lot so when the
[1:09:39] world is sad to work with a head down
[1:09:41] and see that is the fashion of the day I
[1:09:43] will refuse and I will come back two
[1:09:46] feet last Sunday Barbara been talking
[1:09:50] about oddball Obama said it clearly that
[1:09:53] we all Autobots one another
[1:09:56] present lot so I'm not ashamed to be

[1:11:48] correct please don't talk about it and
[1:11:50] you know we have to you know okay let's
[1:11:53] 21 okay so because that when everybody
[1:11:58] got it yes when they knew God they
[1:12:00] glorified him not as God neither we have
[1:12:03] found four but because but became vain
[1:12:06] in their imaginations look at it and we
[1:12:09] have foolish sorry and their foolish
[1:12:12] heart was darkened because what mom said
[1:12:15] a fool has said there's no God right so
[1:12:19] when it took God out of the equation
[1:12:21] their lives and the activities they
[1:12:26] become foolish they become they become
[1:12:28] mental and think old I say that's more
[1:12:31] than that's the order of the day don't
[1:12:33] even dare to come against it okay let's
[1:12:36] follow the Scriptures verse twenty-two
[1:12:40] professing themselves to be wise okay
[1:12:43] yeah go to be wise they became fools and
[1:12:48] changed glory of the uncorruptible God
[1:12:52] into an image made like corruption
[1:12:54] corruptible man and to birds and
[1:12:56] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[1:13:00] wherefore God was God also gave them up
[1:13:03] to uncleanness to the loss of their own
[1:13:06] hearts to dishonour their own bodies
[1:13:08] between themselves who changed the truth
[1:13:12] of God into a lie and worshipped and
[1:13:15] served the creature more than the
[1:13:17] Creator who is blessed forever amen for
[1:13:21] this cause God
[1:13:22] get them up into vile affections for
[1:13:26] even their women did change the natural
[1:13:28] use into that which is against nature
[1:13:32] lesbianism right
[1:13:35] and likewise also the men leaving the
[1:13:37] natural use of women moon and old Indian
[1:13:41] laws won't was another men with men
[1:13:44] working that which is unseemly
[1:13:46] homosexual ISM right through the Lord
[1:13:51] and receive it look at in themselves
[1:13:54] that recompence of their error which was
[1:13:57] meet and even as it did not like to
[1:14:01] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[1:14:05] up over to a reprobate mind to do things
[1:14:10] which are not confident and I looked up
[1:14:14] the word people bit bad weekend
[1:14:19] shameless immoral corrupt hardened and
[1:14:25] all regenerate praise the Lord
[1:14:30] that's the world living here and this is
[1:14:33] the norm of the day praise the Lord all
[1:14:37] the nations visit is it lesbian gay
[1:14:42] bisexual transgender and Q and I you
[1:14:49] know what K being squid so those who are
[1:14:51] not sure where that men a woman that
[1:14:54] he's so crazy it's not crazy
[1:15:00] tango for Malachi for hallelujah thank
[1:15:04] God for Christ himself
[1:15:06] hallelujah he came down himself no I
[1:15:10] don't feel sorry for those who
[1:15:12] questioned the minister brahbrah are
[1:15:14] will Abraha how could a man make this up
[1:15:20] no matter how you are so you have
[1:15:25] ability to make up things and the see
[1:15:27] people cannot raise the Lord so this was
[1:15:34] february 28 1964 where correct
[1:15:39] yeah c3 yes thank you that God already
[1:15:44] prophesied gave this to the prophet and
[1:15:47] prophesied
[1:15:47] that is several angels and when it
[1:15:50] happened in that vision he thought his
[1:15:52] life was over because they're gonna be a
[1:15:55] change the turning point in the ministry
[1:15:57] to bring the world that was ripped to
[1:16:00] prepare you and I and now what is Christ
[1:16:05] so that's what we are going beyond goes
[1:16:07] and the Prophet so what the purpose said
[1:16:10] we're going beyond the sign to the voice
[1:16:14] of the sign but the voice will now take
[1:16:17] us to our destination ma so if I come in
[1:16:23] from agony we are working and you two
[1:16:25] samples Wellington yeah so as a sign if
[1:16:29] I stop there no good well I had to for
[1:16:33] this sign to my destination and that is
[1:16:37] how why we we have to us individuals
[1:16:41] take this message personally it is not
[1:16:45] enough to come to church on Sunday and
[1:16:47] hear problems preach a wonderful message
[1:16:49] and and that's it and probably on the
[1:16:53] Wednesday or not and they come back on
[1:16:55] Sunday
[1:16:56] no is a daily effect hmmm
[1:17:01] I'm approbation about worship in so it's
[1:17:04] not just singing and praising is the
[1:17:08] daily life you worship when you lead to
[1:17:11] some your friend your family members
[1:17:14] what do you say to the person how you
[1:17:17] react how it what their lives is what
[1:17:22] should be worshipped and pleasing him so
[1:17:26] we are we we are not profit here so we
[1:17:30] fill so what what bit a difference is
[1:17:35] how quick we can make things right
[1:17:37] ma how big we can repent and not be too
[1:17:41] quick to point fingers because when you
[1:17:44] are pointing this and responding to be
[1:17:47] towards it
[1:17:48] so we can say something got our knees
[1:17:52] and say Lord I bring my brother on the
[1:17:55] altar with me but the blood for me is
[1:17:57] for him me is for her bring my wife I've
[1:18:02] been my children and when you're doing
[1:18:04] that there's still room for bitterness
[1:18:08] because you cannot be in God's presence
[1:18:10] and be bitter present Lord
[1:18:18] so I've always said in the ocean of time
[1:18:24] so just to see to hear what was said
[1:18:26] about this day so many years ago is that
[1:18:31] the passion was to be a sign of the end
[1:18:33] and today the portion is in the
[1:18:36] homosexual is on the increase that even
[1:18:39] 40% of our national government is
[1:18:42] possessed with profession that's
[1:18:44] newspaper that's right and said again in
[1:18:49] modern events mclubbe a prophesy and so
[1:18:53] remember just said as it was the days of
[1:18:55] Sodom on Sodom socially BR the coming of
[1:18:57] the Son of Man so everybody agree about
[1:19:02] the the world is in some condition yeah
[1:19:07] and they say it keeps you keep putting
[1:19:10] the profit so I picked up Los Angeles a
[1:19:13] paper not long ago and said I think
[1:19:16] Hamas is on the increase of 20 or 30% in
[1:19:21] Los Angeles each year a cuisine that
[1:19:23] much always horrible government and
[1:19:26] everywhere everything just becoming
[1:19:28] Privett that's right the whole thing the
[1:19:32] whole system the church and everything
[1:19:34] else is provided what is it a day just
[1:19:43] a day just like that look at perversion
[1:19:48] whom Allah pick up in a pepper pepper
[1:19:49] last look this is this is how many years
[1:19:52] ago almost 50s from the years ago right
[1:19:55] so how about today so just to show you
[1:19:59] where we are it's only time to relax I'm
[1:20:02] Stan Stan fluff flat-footed say Tata be
[1:20:05] on our toes and say Lord let this word
[1:20:11] reveled me let me be the Word made flesh
[1:20:16] bring me to my place my promise for
[1:20:18] these days our adoption looking for body
[1:20:22] change looking for the rapture amen
[1:20:26] so it's going to be a deliberate
[1:20:30] conscious work with the Lord and it
[1:20:36] double so smart
[1:20:37] how does not say that the sons of the
[1:20:41] king of the world are wiser the sounds
[1:20:44] of the kingdom why in the sense that you
[1:20:46] know this is all that will make it to
[1:20:48] glory

[1:20:59] tweet that on Twitter too and you spend
[1:21:02] all your time and add any feel empty and
[1:21:07] there's no no desire for the Lord
[1:21:11] here's the Lord so that's the devil's
[1:21:14] trap trick but God is here today and
[1:21:20] then his prince is here
[1:21:24] what is't said I'm not about I'm just

[1:25:09] God if if he let us live the way we live
[1:25:13] and get by within he will make us pay
[1:25:16] for our sins and as I've said before I

[1:27:10] message should Wendy train grew up and
[1:27:14] you grow up from your childhood here and
[1:27:17] about Bihar by the Bible but that does

[1:31:35] was in dungeon if any man has a right to
[1:31:39] quit on God and to give up because he
[1:31:42] was simile for second he told Joseph he
[1:31:46] was cussing to dungeon for taking a
[1:31:48] stand against him how could God allow
[1:31:51] him to be truth in prison when he had
[1:31:55] made such a courageous and loyal stand
[1:31:58] for God surely Joseph had a right to
[1:32:02] rebel and to be sly into a co-state
[1:32:08] after such a thing he could have
[1:32:15] he prayed and she believed for this
[1:32:18] furniture and looked to God's mighty

[1:35:14] first book him in alright now alright
[1:35:23] when God provides he provides the best
[1:35:25] and when God provides Brian a wafer to

[1:37:03] he had so much change in strategy and
[1:37:06] Satan has no much changed his either how
[1:37:10] he got into Adam and Eve he gets into
[1:37:13] them today why he trying to risen it out
[1:37:16] now it's reasonable that go will just
[1:37:20] quit worry that was go will not o God
[1:37:23] has said does the devil say speaking to
[1:37:25] Eve said Satan but surely a holy God
[1:37:29] wouldn't do this
[1:37:30] surely he says surely he will because he
[1:37:35] said he would
[1:37:36] hallelujah wonderful and so he said the
[1:37:43] Bible said in first John to the three
[1:37:44] was Ray said build our holy but was a
[1:37:49] bitter holy even as your heavenly Father
[1:37:51] is holy and in first chakra three said
[1:37:54] and every manner has his hope purified
[1:37:58] himself law prepare me to be a sanctuary
[1:38:04] she'll run holy tried and true when you
[1:38:10] learned it on the computer right now
[1:38:12] going into into you know websites and
[1:38:16] things that you go
[1:38:17] nah prepare me to be a sanctuary but
[1:38:22] they work on cyclic this you say no no
[1:38:24] no that's not for me
[1:38:25] hallelujah go go to God Amy
[1:38:29] everyone that has this hope in him
[1:38:31] provide himself a min and look at what
[1:38:34] what Bertram talked about the official
[1:38:36] Church ish and love this was commending
[1:38:41] them he says that cannot be the evil
[1:38:47] which temperature evil those officiants
[1:38:52] that gods that those if you don't
[1:38:56] believe now God's people ought to be
[1:38:58] holy I come to this verse they took
[1:39:02] steps to keep the body the body on
[1:39:05] leaven from saying the the we're a
[1:39:08] separated people they have they have
[1:39:11] come out of the world and now they
[1:39:14] weren't going to let the world and among
[1:39:18] them they will not put up with him in
[1:39:22] the church holiness wasn't a phrase with
[1:39:28] them or a figure of speech it is a way
[1:39:32] of life hallelujah
[1:39:35] mine and inside their apartment with
[1:39:38] vision our spirit is clean it is fresh
[1:39:42] it is real it is sober and serious but
[1:39:45] nonetheless full of joy of the Lord so
[1:39:48] coming to church should not make you
[1:39:50] reasonable I mean a miserable I know
[1:39:55] forget it that was lie there's a lord my
[1:40:00] just think how God came down from glory
[1:40:06] for your sake and lay down his life and
[1:40:11] forgave you pay the price right and then
[1:40:15] in 896 came de himself it came down in
[1:40:21] the supernatural and appeared in the sky
[1:40:26] and this picture was taken by scientists
[1:40:28] what think of Barack Obama or the
[1:40:30] Braille is full of better and they know
[1:40:32] what scientists they were calling
[1:40:34] anybody knows who what this was about
[1:40:38] come on tell us what I would tell you
[1:40:41] when he came to you and I I said turn
[1:40:44] the picture whose face is that Christ
[1:40:48] hallelujah and Christ came he came down
[1:40:52] to get you Priscilla so it says the
[1:41:03] Christian ought to be just as exuberant
[1:41:06] and full of his pleasure in the Lord as
[1:41:08] the world is when in service and the
[1:41:11] lies in his pleasures both prisons and
[1:41:15] the world are human yet both of emotions
[1:41:18] that's why that's why if my first time
[1:41:24] is when I'm in the church and don't put
[1:41:26] my Kotel a mess because if if if if if
[1:41:31] it God if rebelled Paso he's a home run
[1:41:38] ma he's out that word because certainly
[1:41:42] prison Oh hallelujah
[1:41:44] victory prison Oh hallelujah
[1:41:47] okay so physilog okay
[1:41:52] the difference is a Christians hearts
[1:41:55] and emotions are purely on the lord of
[1:41:58] glory and it's long while the world
[1:42:03] satisfied the flesh
[1:42:05] others in the world the lust of the
[1:42:08] flesh lust of the eye pride of life
[1:42:11] money women men popularity we can sum it
[1:42:16] up there for the Lord and if in the
[1:42:22] Lahore is designed or dingo right and if
[1:42:26] that is not the case that may would
[1:42:28] actually find something to feel it
[1:42:30] that's why alcohol drugs name it and
[1:42:36] what is it what does it do it ends up
[1:42:38] destroying individual so that's why it's
[1:42:41] not covet the world don't think that
[1:42:43] that your classmates or work mate is
[1:42:45] having a good time he doesn't know the
[1:42:49] world you're living in so it's for you
[1:42:51] to prove to him or her that you in a
[1:42:55] better world come to my side I'm not
[1:42:59] gonna cut your side hallelujah oh my so
[1:43:04] that's cool so I was saying trying to
[1:43:08] make an illustration of you talking
[1:43:10] about this he said let no evil come into
[1:43:12] your mind all your thinking just dismiss
[1:43:16] it if it knocks at the door take it away
[1:43:19] just say just show your token just keep
[1:43:23] walking I am on the block remember there
[1:43:28] was there was a lot of them come by the
[1:43:33] women that might say hey Gertie Lilly
[1:43:38] some of you come out we are going to a
[1:43:40] party tonight have a good time what what
[1:43:45] does Christian Christian Taylor boy said
[1:43:48] I am under the blood I'm already talking
[1:43:52] to say here my love is my Mecca
[1:43:56] why because I know that death is on the
[1:43:59] land it's alone okay so here having a
[1:44:08] continuous City and the bread of just
[1:44:12] Christ is on our way to glory
[1:44:15] the money trains here don't be caught
[1:44:18] too late I would get the morning train
[1:44:21] the first one express one hallelujah
[1:44:25] wonderful praise the Lord so the pros
[1:44:30] were talking about on Exodus he said and
[1:44:32] their names are put in last book of life
[1:44:34] before different showing the world and
[1:44:35] they're in their elected and when that
[1:44:39] light splashes over them like that then
[1:44:41] the emotional walls drop away from them
[1:44:44] and here they come come out from among
[1:44:47] them said Holy Ghost in these last days
[1:44:49] touch not the unclean thing well I'll be
[1:44:52] good to you you misunderstood me now
[1:44:57] want to say so that's the weights again
[1:44:59] today God is calling amen so we're now
[1:45:02] we are now moved for the negative we're
[1:45:04] now going to the positive so what God is
[1:45:07] is doing now so we're not to touch
[1:45:11] members or or what how regulators and a
[1:45:16] group of God business to make it back to
[1:45:25] God when away it takes Lord give me
[1:45:27] grace Lord that we desire so that's
[1:45:32] weights again to their God is correlated
[1:45:34] people and they're later now and now
[1:45:36] they let if what for a resurrection and
[1:45:40] what kind of a science is showing is he
[1:45:43] showing them resurrection sign now he's
[1:45:48] showing the power of the resurrection
[1:45:50] this of his son living among us to
[1:45:54] resurrect them from the grave and grave
[1:45:56] yet that were in to the land that his
[1:45:58] promises was a sign going out of
[1:46:02] spiritual Egypt and switcher Babylon and
[1:46:06] as it was sorry as it wasn't days of
[1:46:10] Sodom so shall it be are they coming or
[1:46:14] sort of man so here we are
[1:46:15] we agree that we already in Sodom right
[1:46:18] and we can see this one of my water any
[1:46:20] iota of doubt came down
[1:46:25] Alleluia he finished with his prophet
[1:46:28] and took him home to rest because it's
[1:46:30] just too much we're human we have been
[1:46:32] to really carry on like this I add I
[1:46:34] fell for the Prophet he had a weight of
[1:46:37] responsibility I've got it so kind and
[1:46:40] took me away and the Pentecostals are
[1:46:42] wrong the amount I just came across
[1:46:45] something YouTube about the you know
[1:46:50] about Kenneth Hagen you know he said
[1:46:53] that that the Bahama trying to make
[1:46:55] himself a Nigel and he he he wrote he
[1:47:00] he's routing to do the paint and he
[1:47:03] didn't pan and go would take his life I
[1:47:06] said what did tommyrot
[1:47:10] for the Lord
[1:47:12] okay so when when they went in 1950
[1:47:16] January when there was a challenge by
[1:47:20] was it doctor best to challenge the
[1:47:24] prophet and say you were false prophet
[1:47:26] or didn't the people that people are
[1:47:27] being healed and everything and then you
[1:47:31] know just to make to make from the
[1:47:32] prophet o so Paul was sitting at the
[1:47:37] back and he didn't you know want to come
[1:47:40] but somehow I was caught to come and
[1:47:42] pray and and the and they want to take
[1:47:46] the picture to see how you know try to
[1:47:48] disgrace the prophet everything and and
[1:47:50] the man got these photographers to take
[1:47:53] the pictures right you know the story
[1:47:55] and when this was developed we're going
[1:47:59] to come to a time just to tell my head
[1:48:00] on my cell but that's fine those all the
[1:48:05] spittle was taking no but nothing
[1:48:07] appeared all the Prophet would blow fire
[1:48:11] can I make that up supernatural prison
[1:48:17] or ampersand has normally a time after
[1:48:22] it happened from back there when the
[1:48:25] pillar of fire laden from from from
[1:48:27] Egypt to the promised land
[1:48:29] there's never appeared war and then
[1:48:31] afterwards we appeared and hit
[1:48:33] saw became Paul right has not happened
[1:48:36] before
[1:48:37] you see how CEO cities are privileged we
[1:48:41] are now when you pick a song book
[1:48:44] reading is not just your orders read a
[1:48:46] man is God I came down people to me sir
[1:48:50] - you are now to get us ready that songs
[1:48:52] you take your seniors and personal and
[1:48:55] say the latest will become flesh in me
[1:48:57] hallelujah now I got God is sovereign so
[1:49:04] even at your best info don't remain
[1:49:06] folly will do what stand off
[1:49:09] hallelujah oh praise the Lord
[1:49:12] okay so let's go as it wasn't this
[1:49:14] absurdum so shall it be any kind of the
[1:49:16] Son of man what kind of a sign the
[1:49:18] church's seat at Sodom what it is
[1:49:20] intellectual choice see to preachers
[1:49:22] what spiritual church elected Abraham -
[1:49:25] group so Abraham and his group saw God
[1:49:29] manifested in the body of flesh of human
[1:49:33] flesh that could descend the spirit
[1:49:36] until one said I was saying behind him
[1:49:44] yes
[1:49:45] and so what what did he do the first I
[1:49:51] saw like he's turned a profit please
[1:49:52] follow me another with the pillar of
[1:49:54] fire and he called the people out so the
[1:49:58] doors right blow fire a quad pull out
[1:50:02] that was the first Exodus and when
[1:50:04] Israel's time was up
[1:50:06] he sent again a God profit with a bill
[1:50:09] of fire John saw he descended from
[1:50:12] heaven like a dog and he said I go to
[1:50:15] God and I return to God after his death
[1:50:20] they run resurrection so love tattoos on
[1:50:23] his road to Damascus so that's simple of
[1:50:25] fire and him being a Hebrew well taught
[1:50:29] in the in the world in the world said
[1:50:32] Lord who are you
[1:50:36] praise the Lord and he knew it was the
[1:50:40] Lord and the pillar of fire he was a
[1:50:43] Hebrew so it was not a pure fire he was
[1:50:48] a Hebrews said who
[1:50:50] you and he said I am Jesus amen and the
[1:50:57] second and so does the second Exodus he
[1:51:13] brought the Prophet anointed with his
[1:51:15] son as Christ God prophet Moses said he
[1:51:18] would be a prophet and and had a pillar
[1:51:22] of fire and dongsaeng some wonders and
[1:51:24] that same prophet said the whosoever
[1:51:28] believeth in me the most I do shall he
[1:51:30] do also now number said he here here he
[1:51:38] probably the same thing in Exodus in the
[1:51:44] last days and he cannot change it
[1:51:47] he cannot changes and by scientific
[1:51:52] proof by witness of the spirit by the
[1:51:55] works of the Spirit we see today the
