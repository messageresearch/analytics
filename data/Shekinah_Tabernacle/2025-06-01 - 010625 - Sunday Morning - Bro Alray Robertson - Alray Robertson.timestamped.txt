[9:38] good to be here this morning. It's nice
[9:40] to see all the additional faces that we
[9:43] don't see on a on a weekly
[9:45] basis. Amen. I trust this is going to be
[9:47] a a blessed time today. I mean, we've
[9:51] got we've got all day. It is uh it's a
[9:54] public holiday tomorrow. So,
[9:56] relax. And uh you know, and it's it's
[9:59] good. We um for for I'm sure all of you
[10:02] know already. So um you know we have we
[10:06] have our musicians here this morning and
[10:08] Alre is going to preach to us and
[10:10] tonight we have Kina musicians and
[10:13] brother Ben preaching to us but um you
[10:16] know it's not a it's not a competition
[10:18] it's not seeing who can do it better who
[10:21] can preach better song lead better play
[10:23] better. I mean we want to come and put
[10:26] all of that aside and not accept that
[10:28] from from the devil. Amen. Because if we
[10:32] start comparing, start competing, we
[10:34] we've missed it. I mean, we we're
[10:36] breaking down unity. So, you know what I
[10:39] would say, you know, we all struggle
[10:42] with criticism now and then. I'm going
[10:44] to sing some songs wrong that you're
[10:46] like, that's not the way it should go.
[10:47] And I'll say, well, it is the way it go.
[10:49] You're singing it wrong, right? And we
[10:50] can go back and forth. But when we can
[10:52] come behind and say, look, I'm going to
[10:54] support this brother. I'm going to
[10:55] support the musician. I know what it's
[10:57] like to play piano, so I'm going to
[10:59] support her. I know what it's like to
[11:00] play guitar. I'm going to support that
[11:02] person. And we do it vice versa. And
[11:05] then we can we can live in unity. And
[11:08] you know, all that matters is the word
[11:10] and Christ in us, Christ in me, Christ
[11:12] in you. Amen. We're all here as uh John
[11:16] one. Oh yeah, John 1 says, I mean, the
[11:18] word made flesh today. That's each one
[11:21] of us. Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[11:25] It's good to be here. Let's sing. Let's
[11:27] start to sing before we um actually
[11:30] let's let's commit this this meeting
[11:32] into the Lord's hands. Where's brother
[11:34] is brother Moses
[11:35] here? As brother Moses, do you do you
[11:38] mind if you could come and and just
[11:39] commit this this meeting into the Lord's
[11:41] hands for us, brother? And um while you
[11:43] do that, we also have a prayer request
[11:45] if you don't mind praying for the prayer
[11:47] request. Um uh Pillah's sister Naomi um
[11:52] her husband Yan has broken his leg and
[11:55] he's in severe pain and and needs a
[11:57] healing touch. So there a few
[11:58] complications there, but I mean the Lord
[12:01] can can reach out. Amen.
[12:13] [Music]
[12:17] God bless you all. Praise the Lord.
[12:20] Shall we bow our heads for
[12:21] prayer? Our dear heavenly father, just
[12:25] want to thank you this morning for
[12:28] bringing us into your
[12:29] presence. Father, we
[12:32] pray. Forgive us, Father, of our wrongs
[12:35] and our trespasses.
[12:37] Lord, we remember the prophet father he
[12:40] was
[12:41] praying. He said, "Lord, if you want to
[12:44] look for clean
[12:46] hands, where would you find
[12:49] them?" And he goes on to say, "The only
[12:52] clean hands, Father, you can find is
[12:55] those that you have sanctified."
[12:58] Father, here we
[13:00] stand
[13:02] sanctified,
[13:05] justified. Heavenly Father, we
[13:07] know we are
[13:11] overcomers. Heavenly Father, as we are
[13:13] coming to realize who we
[13:15] are, we thank you,
[13:18] master, and we bless your holy name. You
[13:22] have made it possible today.
[13:25] There was a wedding father in Ghana and
[13:30] Jesus was
[13:31] there. Today I say there's a meeting in
[13:35] pools and Jesus is
[13:38] here. Lord God of heaven we know
[13:41] whatever your presence
[13:43] was there was healing.
[13:47] Father, may when we leave this place,
[13:50] Father, leave it. Father, different
[13:53] people, the sick being
[13:57] healed, the blind
[14:00] seeing, the
[14:02] backsliden picking up themselves,
[14:05] Father, because we are in your
[14:08] presence. Father, we thank you. Even the
[14:12] ministering of the
[14:13] word we didn't come father to hear a man
[14:17] speak. We came heavenly father to hear
[14:20] the lord Jesus Christ borrowing some
[14:23] lips borrowing some hands and
[14:26] ministering unto us. We thank you my
[14:30] master. Thank you father. Bless those
[14:33] who are still on their way coming. And
[14:36] may you bless our time here father. We
[14:39] thank you father for you are always the
[14:41] same yesterday, today and forever. And
[14:44] we thank you for your presence which is
[14:46] right
[14:47] here. Father to doubt your presence is
[14:51] sin because he said wherever two or
[14:54] three of you are gathered in my name I
[14:56] will be there. We thank you master. May
[14:59] you bless the song leader. May bless
[15:02] heavenly father the
[15:04] musicians as we go higher and higher
[15:07] into worshiping

[15:11] the lord Jesus Christ. Father we thank
[15:13] you.

[15:48] a pram that you need to take to the
[15:49] mother's room, there's a lift two doors
[15:52] down. There's a lift to the right. You

[15:59] open air deck. You just walk all the way
[16:01] across and there's a room essentially
[16:02] just above above this stage is a room
[16:05] for the mother's room. Um,

[47:16] Oh.
[47:22] Oh. Hallelujah.
[47:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust that
[47:27] comes from from our hearts this morning.
[47:30] It's just a really special day, a really
[47:32] special special time.
[47:36] Um
[47:38] remember in that time uh 12 years ago
[47:40] when I became pastor, brother Greg
[47:42] passed me a book called Who Moved My
[47:44] Cheese? And the moral of the story was
[47:47] these mice their lives were upset every
[47:50] time someone made a little change in
[47:52] their lives. So sometimes we as human
[47:53] beings don't like change but let's
[47:56] embrace the change today.
[47:58] It's a little out of our usual comfort
[48:00] zone, I guess. And and uh we just um we
[48:03] just want to come to praise the Lord. We
[48:05] just want to come to uh just have a a
[48:08] time of fellowship and
[48:10] um from brother Ben and myself. I would
[48:12] like to welcome each and everyone this
[48:14] morning and trust that you didn't have
[48:16] to get up too early, but we kind of well
[48:19] some people scored. I guess we can say
[48:21] it that way that don't live too far
[48:23] away, but um trust that we that we all
[48:26] come for the right reason and that we'll
[48:27] just spend some time to uh to fellowship
[48:30] and so on. I also want to want to say
[48:32] thank you for for the sacrifices. Thank
[48:35] you for putting in the time and the
[48:36] effort to come this morning. May God
[48:38] bless you for that. I also want to say a
[48:41] special thank you to brother Dean,
[48:43] brother Moses, brother John for um
[48:46] closing your churches and and joining us
[48:48] today. Just uh just trust that it will
[48:51] be worth it for us today. Amen. Also,
[48:54] just a very brief thank you for so many
[48:56] that's uh done tireless work before the
[48:59] beforehand and I know yesterday there
[49:01] were um Joseph and Mana were here from
[49:03] fairly early till very late last night
[49:05] and Matt and Steven and different ones.
[49:08] So on so many different fronts, there
[49:10] was a lot that happened. Brother Kovalin
[49:12] was here and different ones. So may God
[49:15] bless you for that. Let's turn in your
[49:18] Bibles to Matthew chapter
[49:20] 24. Thank you musicians. God bless you
[49:23] and thank you for those song items.
[49:34] There's something else that I uh forgot
[49:36] to do and that is
[49:38] um where's Joshua
[49:42] Nier? There he is. I think we need to
[49:45] sing happy birthday to him. By the way,
[49:47] is there anyone else whose birthday it
[49:48] is today?
[49:52] Who?
[49:56] There we
[49:56] go. What's your name? Raha. Raha.
[50:02] Okay. Well, let's sing for the two of
[50:04] them together. So, we'll just say happy
[50:05] birthday, dear brother. So, it applies
[50:07] to both. Okay. Happy birthday to you.
[50:13] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday,
[50:18] dear
[50:20] brother. Happy birthday to
[50:24] you. Praise the Lord. I mean, we're all
[50:27] family. we can just be ourselves this
[50:29] morning. So, let's turn in ma uh in our
[50:31] Bibles to Matthew
[50:33] 24 and we're going to start from verse
[50:38] 22. He's a clicker of mine. Praise the
[50:45] Lord. So Jesus speaking here and except
[50:47] those days should be shortened, there
[50:49] should no flesh be saved, but for the
[50:52] elect's sake those days shall be
[50:53] shortened. We're living in those days.
[50:56] Then if any man shall say unto you, "Lo,
[50:58] here is Christ or there, believe it
[51:00] not." For there shall rise false Christs
[51:03] and false prophets, and shall show great
[51:05] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[51:07] were possible, they shall deceive the
[51:09] very elect. Behold, I have told you
[51:12] before. Wherefore, if they shall say
[51:14] unto you, Behold, he is in the desert,
[51:16] go not forth. Behold, he is in the
[51:18] secret chambers, believe it not. For as
[51:20] the lightning cometh out of the east,
[51:22] and shineth even unto the west, so shall
[51:24] also the coming of the son of man
[51:27] be. Amen. Let's just
[51:31] pray. Blessed father, we are so
[51:34] thankful, privileged, Lord, for this
[51:36] opportunity to come and fellowship
[51:38] around your word this morning. Amen.
[51:40] Father, and we just welcome you. Oh
[51:43] Lord, I pray for grace, Lord, to step
[51:46] out of the way, Father, so that your
[51:48] Holy Spirit can anoint and use the gift
[51:51] in my life. Father, I pray for my
[51:54] brothers and sisters, each one maybe
[51:56] some streaming different situations,
[51:58] Father. Lord, I pray that each one of
[52:00] us, Lord, will step beside ourselves,
[52:03] Father. that every channel will be open,
[52:05] Father, so that you can speak, Lord, so
[52:07] that you can feed our souls this
[52:09] morning. Father, we just surrender. I
[52:12] pray, Father, that there will be nothing
[52:13] to hinder or distract. Father, I pray
[52:16] that Lord, every complex, every fear,
[52:19] everything, Lord, that's even now
[52:21] possibly trying to work and get in
[52:23] between, Father, will be out of the way,
[52:25] Lord, so that we can receive from you
[52:26] this morning. Father, we just commit the
[52:29] service to you. We ask it in the
[52:31] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:33] Amen. Amen. You may be
[52:54] seated. Praise the Lord. So before I
[52:58] start, I just want to say, you know, we
[52:59] we're a different we we're a different
[53:01] group than we usually are and we come
[53:04] from a few different assemblies. Also
[53:06] hate the fact that I'm so far away from
[53:08] you. I like to be able to be close and
[53:11] uh and not not so far. And so this is in
[53:15] itself a little um awkward. I guess the
[53:18] other thing is and I'll just as I say be
[53:20] myself. This pullpit's angle is so high
[53:23] that my tablet is sliding off all the
[53:25] time. So hopefully I don't drop it. So
[53:27] praise the Lord that that trust that the
[53:29] Lord will help. Um but I I want to say
[53:32] this that um you know we we all come
[53:35] from different backgrounds, different
[53:36] makeups, different mindsets, different
[53:38] things. And um you know, we all look at
[53:42] the word slightly
[53:43] different. Um and and I want to say this
[53:46] morning, you know, maybe I'll say
[53:48] things using different terminology or
[53:50] coming from a different perspective than
[53:52] than what you say. And and all I'll say
[53:55] is like the prophet says, you know, if
[53:57] you're eating chicken, if you hit a
[53:59] bone, well, spit the bone out and keep
[54:01] on eating chicken. Don't throw the whole
[54:03] chicken away. But I'll also say, as the
[54:05] prophet says, make sure it's a bone,
[54:07] though. Amen. So, we just we just want
[54:10] to be ourselves and we just want to have
[54:12] the Lord um have his his way with us
[54:14] this morning. Um so, the Lord has really
[54:17] pressed on my heart over the last two or
[54:19] three days to uh to share this thought,
[54:21] and it's it's a simple thought. I'll
[54:23] pre-warn you with that. But um we are
[54:26] simple people and and brother Brandham
[54:29] quoted so many times how you know how
[54:32] God said in his word, it was hidden from
[54:34] the wise and prudent but revealed to
[54:35] babes. And I'm so thankful that the Lord
[54:37] has revealed the things to us. And the
[54:40] revelation makes it so simple. Amen.
[54:44] So, I'll pick this up by speaking about
[54:47] how God spoke through prophets over the
[54:49] years and God inspired them to write
[54:52] scriptures and God captured his word.
[54:56] But his word really is his eternal
[54:58] thoughts that was expressed in word form
[55:00] or in logos form. And as God spoke more
[55:04] and as God revealed more, what God was
[55:07] doing is he was showing a little more of
[55:10] his redemption plan. And as the years
[55:13] and the ages rolled on, God revealed a
[55:15] little more and a little more and a
[55:17] little more. And and it's just beautiful
[55:20] how, you know, God in everything he
[55:23] does, he reveals who he is. He expresses
[55:27] some of his attributes. I always love to
[55:30] think about the thought that, you know,
[55:31] when we speak about God and our
[55:33] relationship to God as husband and wife
[55:36] and we see so many beautiful types and
[55:39] we so see, you know, so much about God
[55:41] and about his character and, you know,
[55:43] how he relates to us and so on. But then
[55:45] we we flip that around and we see how we
[55:48] are the child and he's the father and
[55:50] it's the same relationship and it's the
[55:52] same thing. But what God does is he uses
[55:54] all these things to let us show a little
[55:57] more of himself. So when we relate to
[55:59] him as our our abba our heavenly father
[56:01] then then we relate to him maybe in
[56:03] slightly different ways than what we
[56:05] would relate as as wife to husband and
[56:07] different things. So in everything that
[56:08] God does as God created as God spoke as
[56:12] God you know prepared the the earth and
[56:15] all those things God reflected his
[56:18] attributes and showed us really who he
[56:20] is and of course in our day who we are.
[56:24] So even little things like God created
[56:27] the earth in six
[56:29] days and on the seventh day he
[56:32] rested and even in those things God gave
[56:35] us clues about his redemption plan and
[56:37] about his plans for the future. Yeah.
[56:40] And and when mankind fell in Eden, God
[56:44] God had had made this statement. God had
[56:47] given the commandment if you eat of this
[56:48] tree that day you eat thereof that day
[56:51] you will die. So when mankind fell, God
[56:54] had to keep his promise. God had to hold
[56:57] what he promised. And he's promised that
[56:59] day you will die. So from that time
[57:01] onwards, no man lived through his
[57:04] thousand years because remember a
[57:06] thousand years is a day with God. And
[57:08] even Methuselah, the man that lived
[57:10] longest on record, never got quite to
[57:13] that thousand years time. Amen. But so
[57:17] now if we look at the creation week,
[57:19] creation week in itself also shows the
[57:22] week of time I will call it or or
[57:24] whatever you want to call it. But it's
[57:26] so beautiful to see how 2,000 years or
[57:29] two days it was the flood. Another two
[57:32] days the cross. Another two days that's
[57:34] where we're at. And we're at the point
[57:36] where the earth would be burnt by fire
[57:38] and cleaned off by fire. And then after
[57:40] that we're going to the seventh day
[57:42] where God rests again. and this time he
[57:45] will rest with his
[57:47] bride. And what's so beautiful even in
[57:49] those things even though it's so so
[57:51] simple God showed us in our day so that
[57:53] we can have the perspective that it was
[57:55] actually the redemption of the earth
[57:57] that was happening because after two two
[58:00] days the earth was justified. After
[58:04] another two days, the earth was
[58:06] sanctified. And then this is the time
[58:09] when the the the falling of the Holy
[58:11] Ghost is coming on the earth where the
[58:12] earth is cleansed by fire. Amen. And
[58:15] then back into eternity with God again.
[58:18] So when the fall happened in Eden, God
[58:20] promised already in that time the seed
[58:22] of the woman would come.
[58:25] And and then for years and years and
[58:27] years I I always my human mind can't
[58:30] quite fathom that because you know we
[58:32] read in the Bible of of all those
[58:34] stories in the Old Testament and how
[58:36] those people just lived and you know you
[58:38] read about Abram he was just you know
[58:40] probably working for his father who made
[58:42] idols and you know he was just going
[58:44] about his business and God came on the
[58:46] scene and God called him and and and we
[58:48] read about the Davids and we read about
[58:50] the Josephs and we read about all those
[58:51] different ones but in each one of those
[58:53] lives God was writing a story. God was
[58:56] showing a little bit about himself. God
[58:58] was pointing forward to to the reality
[59:01] of the type. Amen. The antitype of the
[59:04] type that would come. So through the
[59:06] lives of those people, through the
[59:08] feasts, through the things that God
[59:10] showed about himself in the Old
[59:11] Testament, through the sacrifices,
[59:13] through the laws, through all those
[59:15] things. Amen. God was pointing forward
[59:18] to an answer to that that would come.
[59:20] the Messiah, the full word, the
[59:21] expression of the word, the word in
[59:23] flesh that would come. And then when
[59:26] Jesus came, he was the fulfillment of
[59:28] those things. He was he was the answer
[59:30] to all those prophecies. He was the
[59:32] answer to the feast. He was the answer
[59:33] to, you know, all those different types
[59:35] and shadows in the Old Testament. And we
[59:37] can say he was the bridegroom coming of
[59:40] the son of man or the first coming of
[59:42] Christ.
[59:44] And and he like I said, he was the
[59:46] fulfillment of so many scriptures. And
[59:49] he was the flesh expression of the
[59:51] thoughts that were in God who became
[59:53] word who became flesh. Amen. So you know
[59:58] the Bible records even you know where he
[1:00:00] would be born in Bethlehem and and those
[1:00:03] things but it was done in a mystery
[1:00:04] form. Amen. And and the Bible records
[1:00:07] how you know out of Egypt I will call my
[1:00:09] son. And even there the the people never
[1:00:12] put two and two together I believe. And
[1:00:14] but when you know when when all those
[1:00:16] little babies were killed and and and
[1:00:18] Joseph and Mary was told by an angel to
[1:00:20] go take him away and he went to Egypt
[1:00:22] and all those things. All those things
[1:00:23] were recorded so beautifully and Isaiah
[1:00:26] prophesied about him and and you know so
[1:00:28] many prophecies in the Old Testament.
[1:00:30] But when he came
[1:00:33] they missed
[1:00:34] him. when he came perfectly in line with
[1:00:38] the mind of God, with every prophecy,
[1:00:41] with every type, with every offering,
[1:00:42] with all those sacrifices, all those
[1:00:44] things, he came perfectly in line, but
[1:00:46] they missed him.
[1:00:48] And very simply, they missed him. They
[1:00:51] even called him Beelzebub because they
[1:00:53] had a preconceived idea of what it would
[1:00:56] be like.
[1:00:58] Amen. They crucified the very one that
[1:01:01] came for their redemption. The very
[1:01:04] redemption plan that he was playing out
[1:01:06] over the over the ages. Amen. For their
[1:01:10] deliverance. Those very ones, they
[1:01:12] crucified
[1:01:14] him.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah. They missed him
[1:01:18] completely. So sad.
[1:01:21] And after Jesus's ascension, he took
[1:01:24] John to the aisle of Patmas and he
[1:01:26] dictated to him the road map for the
[1:01:29] future. And what he was doing is he was
[1:01:32] laying out the road map, I'll call it
[1:01:34] the road map for the new testament or
[1:01:37] the new
[1:01:39] covenant, the new agreement.
[1:01:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:50] So it shows us how in the New Testament.
[1:01:52] So so what is so beautiful God recorded
[1:01:55] in the book of revelation he wrote those
[1:01:58] letters to the seven churches and in
[1:02:00] those letters to the seven churches he
[1:02:02] showed how those church ages would play
[1:02:03] out over the next 2,000 years.
[1:02:06] But the situation is if you asked for
[1:02:09] someone in Ephesus, you know, do you
[1:02:11] know you're in the Ephesian church age?
[1:02:13] They would have said no clue. No idea.
[1:02:16] They had no idea where they were.
[1:02:18] Smyrna, Pergamos, all the way. Amen.
[1:02:20] They had no idea where they were at. But
[1:02:22] yet God prophesied it perfectly. God
[1:02:25] described to a tea the nature of the
[1:02:27] age, the things that would happen in the
[1:02:29] age. All those typologies and stuff that
[1:02:31] we can only in this day look back and
[1:02:33] see yes, that's where how it worked and
[1:02:36] you know this is the age where it fell
[1:02:37] and this is the age where Satan seed
[1:02:39] moved and you know all those different
[1:02:40] things played out. We are so privileged
[1:02:42] brothers and sisters. Amen. Yeah. And so
[1:02:45] throughout the New Testament, all those
[1:02:47] things that God prophesied beforehand
[1:02:51] played out. But God didn't just stop
[1:02:54] there. He didn't just show seven church
[1:02:55] ages. God also then went to another
[1:02:57] level and he showed the the anointings.
[1:03:00] Amen. God showed what the what the
[1:03:04] attributes would be behind the the
[1:03:06] spirit would be behind those different
[1:03:08] church ages. God showed who the the
[1:03:10] messengers to those church ages would
[1:03:12] be. all those different things. Amen.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah. God showed it so
[1:03:17] beautifully. I I just read the other day
[1:03:20] and I shared the quote in church how
[1:03:21] brother Rams, you know, he says we need
[1:03:24] the church ages as a foundation, but the
[1:03:26] church ages just gives us the history of
[1:03:28] the church. He says, but then the seals
[1:03:30] come come on top of that and it shows us
[1:03:32] the spirit behind it. And it it shows us
[1:03:34] really the battle plan. It shows us, you
[1:03:36] know, what happens happened behind the
[1:03:38] scenes be the spirit that that that work
[1:03:41] behind those things. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:43] And then brother Random says it goes
[1:03:45] from there to the trumpets and the vials
[1:03:46] and different things. And what it
[1:03:48] continually doing is it's just showing
[1:03:50] more of God and more of God and more of
[1:03:51] God.
[1:03:54] But now remember I spoke about the Old
[1:03:55] Testament. All those things built up to
[1:03:58] Jesus.
[1:03:59] But in the New Testament, God is leaving
[1:04:02] a whole lot of clues because God is
[1:04:04] building up to something again. Amen.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah.
[1:04:08] We can also look at it in this
[1:04:10] way. The stature of a perfect man. And I
[1:04:13] and I trust, you know, that we're all on
[1:04:16] the same page with these things. You
[1:04:17] know, some people might draw it slightly
[1:04:20] differently and so forth. And and I'm
[1:04:22] I'm going to share things and I and I
[1:04:23] started off with that. I'm going to
[1:04:25] share things today that, you know, maybe
[1:04:26] some of you see slightly differently,
[1:04:28] but
[1:04:30] but don't don't take it as yay and amen.
[1:04:33] Take it before the Lord if if there's
[1:04:35] differences and so
[1:04:37] forth.
[1:04:39] So, let's just let's just go back to
[1:04:42] that timeline again. I mentioned that.
[1:04:43] I'm just going to graphically show
[1:04:46] it how the spirit behind those different
[1:04:49] ages. Amen. So Satan's attack, Satan's
[1:04:54] main focus in those different ages, how
[1:04:57] in those early ages, he came in as that
[1:04:59] antichrist spirit, that deceptive
[1:05:02] spirit, the spirit that looks good but
[1:05:04] twists the word and so forth. That's how
[1:05:06] Satan always start. And then how over
[1:05:09] time he he that that same riot got on
[1:05:12] the red horse which now created war and
[1:05:15] he was you know caused fighting and all
[1:05:17] those kind of things. And then after a
[1:05:18] while under the under the next ages then
[1:05:21] he he changed the horse colors again.
[1:05:23] And then he was on this this this black
[1:05:26] horse which was what? Control. Amen. And
[1:05:29] that's how Satan always does. He does it
[1:05:30] in families. He does it in individuals.
[1:05:32] He did it through the ages.
[1:05:34] Deception, fighting, control. And what
[1:05:37] he aims for eventually is that pale
[1:05:39] horse of death which brother Ram shows
[1:05:40] us he's a mixture of all those other
[1:05:42] horses
[1:05:44] together. But praise the Lord the story
[1:05:47] doesn't stop there. Before because
[1:05:50] brother Ram quotes the scripture I think
[1:05:51] it's in Isaiah so many times when the
[1:05:54] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[1:05:55] of God raises up a standard against it.
[1:05:58] So when that those horse riders were
[1:05:59] riding, before the horse riders came
[1:06:01] there, before that white horse rider got
[1:06:04] there, there was already a lion.
[1:06:06] Hallelujah. God had already given a lion
[1:06:08] anointing, a lion power on the church of
[1:06:11] those early ages. Hallelujah. So that so
[1:06:14] that that lion could withstand
[1:06:16] everything. That lion had everything it
[1:06:18] needed. The church under that power,
[1:06:20] under that anointing of the lion had
[1:06:22] everything that they needed to overcome
[1:06:24] anything the deception of the white
[1:06:26] horse could throw at them. And the same
[1:06:29] thing when when the when the enemy
[1:06:30] changed horses and he became that red
[1:06:32] horse and he started fighting. Amen.
[1:06:35] Never fight a red horse with a red
[1:06:37] horse. Amen. God's response was not to
[1:06:39] fight back. God's response was a a ox
[1:06:43] sacrificial animal. I mean a
[1:06:46] burdenbearer. Amen. That's God's
[1:06:48] response to that that red horse, that
[1:06:50] attack. And then when when when Satan
[1:06:53] changed horses and he tried to control
[1:06:55] again and control doctrine and control
[1:06:57] dogma and all those things, God raised
[1:06:58] up a man's spirit against it. And in our
[1:07:02] day, when all those things come
[1:07:03] together, God raised up that that eagle
[1:07:06] anointing and we believe we're under
[1:07:07] that eagle anointing. Again, brothers
[1:07:09] and sisters, I come back to this point
[1:07:10] over and over and over. And that's
[1:07:12] really going to be my theme this
[1:07:13] morning. We are so privileged
[1:07:16] because we're not living in darkness
[1:07:17] anymore. We're not living in a time when
[1:07:19] the church is just going through the
[1:07:21] motions, but you know, we we we don't
[1:07:23] have perspective. We've got perspective.
[1:07:25] Remember what I said at the start? God
[1:07:27] showed us a map.
[1:07:29] Amen. God showed us a map of where the
[1:07:31] church was going to go in the New
[1:07:33] Testament. Hallelujah. Today, we can
[1:07:36] look back and we can see this is how the
[1:07:38] map mapped out over time. Or if we look
[1:07:41] at it from the pyramid perspective, this
[1:07:42] is how that that panned out. Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] But there's so many more things
[1:07:48] throughout the Bible and we can spend
[1:07:49] probably days on these things, but I'm
[1:07:51] just going to refer to one or two. You
[1:07:52] read in the Old Testament of Joel.
[1:07:55] Now, it says that bright tree was going
[1:07:57] to be eaten down and was going to be
[1:08:00] restored. Hallelujah. Even in the Old
[1:08:02] Testament, years and years and years
[1:08:04] before even Jesus was on the scene, God
[1:08:06] already prophesied through Joel how that
[1:08:08] that brery, how that that seed would
[1:08:10] have to die and go into the ground first
[1:08:12] and then through through several stages
[1:08:14] be restored back again. Hallelujah. God,
[1:08:18] do you know God actually through Joel
[1:08:20] prophesied the reformation process.
[1:08:23] Amen. When Joel said, "Thus say the
[1:08:26] Lord, I will restore." God's thinking
[1:08:29] included Martin Luther, John Wesley,
[1:08:31] brother Brandham.
[1:08:33] Amen. Because that's the process by we
[1:08:36] by which he was going to restore the
[1:08:38] bride. God had put those clues
[1:08:40] throughout the Bible. But for years and
[1:08:42] centuries, brothers and sisters, people
[1:08:44] had no idea what was happening. They
[1:08:46] were just going through the motions.
[1:08:47] They were just, you know, in the time
[1:08:49] when, you know, when when that red horse
[1:08:51] was going, they were just, you know,
[1:08:53] going and and being killed at the stake
[1:08:55] and burnt and fed to lions and all sorts
[1:08:57] of things. They didn't know in
[1:08:59] perspective what we have today why they
[1:09:01] were going through those things. Can you
[1:09:03] imagine a thousand
[1:09:05] years, generation after generation after
[1:09:08] generation after generation just
[1:09:10] completely hunted and and and and and
[1:09:13] pushed out from society and disrespected
[1:09:15] and
[1:09:16] disowned. And yet the wonderful thing is
[1:09:19] there was a group that was anointed by
[1:09:21] that ox anointing and God kept them. And
[1:09:24] the more pressure the the the the
[1:09:26] Catholic Church put on them, hallelujah,
[1:09:28] the more God kept them through those
[1:09:30] things. And and I want to say, brothers
[1:09:32] and sisters, it couldn't have been easy
[1:09:34] for them to go through all those trials.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. But God gave them the
[1:09:39] anointing to cope with it. God gave them
[1:09:42] the peace in the middle of that storm.
[1:09:43] It wasn't that it wasn't a storm. It
[1:09:45] absolutely was a storm, but God kept
[1:09:48] them in that storm. Amen. So now also
[1:09:53] God I I referred to the reformation
[1:09:55] process. And again the beautiful thing
[1:09:57] is the reformation process in itself
[1:10:00] types the rebirth again. Amen.
[1:10:03] Justification under Luther that's the
[1:10:05] first step of the rebirth process and
[1:10:07] then sanctification under Wesley and
[1:10:09] then the the Holy Ghost in in this last
[1:10:13] age. And in the middle you have the
[1:10:14] restoration of the gifts too. But the
[1:10:17] process, brothers and sisters, is
[1:10:19] showing so beautifully the the the how
[1:10:22] God reforms the church, re reestablishes
[1:10:25] the church again, brings that bride,
[1:10:27] that bride tree back to the fullness of
[1:10:29] the life that went into the ground in
[1:10:31] the first place 2,000 years ago.
[1:10:35] And the point I'm making, brothers and
[1:10:37] sisters, I want to bring it back to the
[1:10:38] map now. God is drawing has drawn. In
[1:10:42] fact, the map was drawn in God's mind
[1:10:44] before the foundation of the earth. But
[1:10:46] God gave us clues. God dropped clues
[1:10:48] through the centuries of his map how the
[1:10:53] bride tree would be restored back and so
[1:10:55] forth.
[1:10:58] So I just want to hone in on one or two
[1:11:00] things
[1:11:03] here. So in our age we we are so
[1:11:07] privileged to to have
[1:11:10] experienced prophecy. I I I want to say
[1:11:14] in an unparalleled way a prophecy being
[1:11:16] fulfilled.
[1:11:18] We've we've you know we we can read in
[1:11:20] the Bible about you know uh in
[1:11:22] Revelation chapter 4 when when John
[1:11:24] hears that voice come up higher. Amen.
[1:11:27] But in our day it's more than just okay
[1:11:29] we read it John heard a voice come up
[1:11:31] higher. No in our day brothers and
[1:11:33] sisters we experienced it. Amen. We see
[1:11:36] the fulfillment of those things.
[1:11:37] Prophecy is now history. As I always
[1:11:40] say, we don't read the book of mystery
[1:11:42] anymore. We read the book of Revelation.
[1:11:44] God has revealed it in our day. Yet, for
[1:11:47] nearly 2,000 years, I mean, people read
[1:11:49] the book of Revelation and and people
[1:11:51] wrote thesis on it and people try to
[1:11:53] figure it out and they misplaced it
[1:11:55] completely. But in our day, God has just
[1:11:57] opened it so much and he's revealed it
[1:12:00] to us. Amen. And I want to say this, God
[1:12:02] is still revealing it to us. And and
[1:12:05] before you get upset with me, I believe
[1:12:08] God revealed these things to the prophet
[1:12:10] as much as he wanted to reveal to the
[1:12:11] prophet. And that's not the point. The
[1:12:14] point is God is still revealing it to
[1:12:16] the individual. There's so many things
[1:12:18] the prophet preached that we're only
[1:12:20] starting to see today.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] So now to come back to the graphic now.
[1:12:29] So we've got the seven church ages
[1:12:31] there.
[1:12:33] Then in our age, the bride is called
[1:12:38] up into the bride age. Here's where I
[1:12:42] might get in trouble with some, but I
[1:12:43] trust not. Amen. The bride is called up
[1:12:46] into the bride age.
[1:12:52] So, we refer to what happened over the
[1:12:54] 2,000 years as the church
[1:12:57] ages. But the bride age is not another
[1:13:00] church age.
[1:13:03] Amen. The bride age is not a eighth age.
[1:13:07] It's not a new day. If it was the eighth
[1:13:09] age, well then we need to start looking
[1:13:11] for eighth messenger. But we run out of
[1:13:13] we run out of types in the Bible when we
[1:13:15] start looking for eighth age for eighth
[1:13:18] messenger. Amen. The bride age is a age
[1:13:21] within an age. And we can hear this
[1:13:24] terminology and then we think, oh my
[1:13:25] goodness, age within an age and it
[1:13:27] becomes a cliche. But the reality is,
[1:13:28] brothers and sisters, it's still here.
[1:13:31] This building was built by Ladyia. Go
[1:13:34] out the front door, you see Ladyia.
[1:13:36] Amen. You upset someone in the street,
[1:13:38] you experience Lady. Right. But the
[1:13:42] bride is called up. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:13:46] the bride, we have the privilege,
[1:13:47] brothers and sisters, that in our day,
[1:13:49] we are you. You see, when brother
[1:13:51] Brandham drew out those those seven
[1:13:53] pictures of the church ages, he sat with
[1:13:55] a conundrum. Amen. Because he said, I
[1:13:58] gave it a little bit of light. But when
[1:13:59] God drew it on the back of the of the
[1:14:01] tabernacle, he drew the seventh one
[1:14:03] completely dark. But you see, that's
[1:14:05] showing what the what the church was
[1:14:07] like. But the bride, she's in go. I
[1:14:11] mean, the bride is not in Lotus here.
[1:14:13] The bride, and I'm speaking spiritually
[1:14:15] now, don't mix the physical and the
[1:14:16] spiritual. Now, the bride, brothers and
[1:14:18] sisters, was called up into that into
[1:14:20] that bride age. And we are walking in
[1:14:22] the light. We are walking in go.
[1:14:24] Hallelujah. Like brother Ram says so
[1:14:26] many times so beautifully at the top of
[1:14:28] the tree. Hallelujah. He says the fruit
[1:14:30] ripens the quickest at the top of the
[1:14:32] tree. Hallelujah. And we in that time
[1:14:34] when the fruit ripens the quickest as
[1:14:37] we've been called up higher. We're
[1:14:39] living in go. I trust that you live in
[1:14:41] goan brothers and sisters.
[1:14:44] So again I'm going to take you to the
[1:14:48] pyramid.
[1:14:49] Now, there's some things here that over
[1:14:53] the years and and and I'll just say this
[1:14:55] is how I believe it. If you believe it
[1:14:57] slightly differently, that's between you
[1:15:00] and the
[1:15:01] Lord. But there's a time when the
[1:15:05] anointing goes from man to
[1:15:09] eagle. There's a there's a time we refer
[1:15:12] to that time as the change of
[1:15:13] administration or the change of
[1:15:16] anointing. The power on the bride of the
[1:15:20] age changes
[1:15:23] and that happened in this age.
[1:15:27] In this age in inside of
[1:15:32] Ladyia the anointing on the bride
[1:15:35] changed from man to eagle.
[1:15:40] Now, for years and years and years when
[1:15:43] I drew that picture, I drew the eagle on
[1:15:45] the seventh
[1:15:48] uh in the in
[1:15:51] Lucia, but that's not how I see it
[1:15:56] anymore. There was a transition inside
[1:16:00] Lodia time wise from man to eagle.
[1:16:07] And we want to make a distinction now.
[1:16:10] The church ages we know was under a son
[1:16:14] of God anointing. I hope this is not
[1:16:17] jumping into deep too quickly. The
[1:16:19] church ages was under the son of God
[1:16:22] anointing. But the eagle is exclusively
[1:16:26] for the bride age. Yes.
[1:16:31] Now, now here's where the confusing
[1:16:34] confusion comes in. Lotusa is still
[1:16:37] running physically speaking. So, you
[1:16:39] you're kind of superimposing the
[1:16:41] headstone over Lotusia in a way. I hope
[1:16:44] I'm not bringing confusion. You're
[1:16:46] getting very
[1:16:47] quiet. Hopefully, you're listening.
[1:16:50] Praise the Lord. But brothers and
[1:16:52] sisters, it's so important to
[1:16:54] understand. Amen. that the bride has
[1:16:58] turned the corner. Amen. And and and I
[1:17:01] want to say this, we've experienced a
[1:17:04] prophet who who ministered who had a
[1:17:07] worldwide ministry, but he ministered
[1:17:09] under two anointings.
[1:17:11] There was a part of his of his ministry
[1:17:14] where he still ministered under the man
[1:17:16] anointing,
[1:17:20] right?
[1:17:24] The eagle
[1:17:27] anointing, it's hard to even put it in
[1:17:29] words. The eagle anointing did not fly
[1:17:31] in Loduceia, but it flew in the time of
[1:17:34] Lucia.
[1:17:36] You understand what I'm saying? The
[1:17:38] eagle anointing is associated with a
[1:17:39] capstone only.
[1:17:43] Even though Leicia time wise is still
[1:17:46] going on.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] So the eagle anointing is specifically
[1:17:54] associated with the opening of the book
[1:17:57] with the opening of the word in the
[1:17:59] bride age and that is when Christ the
[1:18:02] headstone came down to the body crying
[1:18:06] grace grace in the old testament uh
[1:18:10] example and in the new testament example
[1:18:13] the mighty angel came down same ex same
[1:18:16] same exact event.
[1:18:18] Amen. The mighty angel coming down, the
[1:18:21] capstone coming down. Amen. Headstone on
[1:18:24] the body.
[1:18:26] And we know because of Revelations 10
[1:18:29] that the seventh earthly messenger is on
[1:18:32] earth when that happens. Amen.
[1:18:36] So when that capstone comes onto the
[1:18:40] pyramid, the seventh angel is on earth.
[1:18:43] Yes.
[1:18:45] So, I'm going to go back to what I said
[1:18:47] earlier. When that capstone comes down,
[1:18:50] the the anointing on that seventh
[1:18:52] messenger changes from man to eagle.
[1:19:00] I think you're on board. Praise the
[1:19:01] Lord.
[1:19:03] Now, there's another implication of
[1:19:05] this. If I take it a step
[1:19:11] further, the first and second pool of
[1:19:13] brother Brandham's ministry was under a
[1:19:16] man
[1:19:18] anointing, a church age anointing,
[1:19:22] a son of God anointing. That's true.
[1:19:28] So, some guys get really exc upset when
[1:19:32] I say this, so I trust you don't. But
[1:19:35] the healing
[1:19:36] services were not an expression of the
[1:19:40] eagle
[1:19:43] anointing. The discernment services were
[1:19:46] not an expression of the eagle
[1:19:49] anointing. Those services was still
[1:19:51] under the man anointing. It was still in
[1:19:53] a church age anointing. That's true.
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:19:58] only the third pull when the word opened
[1:20:01] when the focus now now again maybe this
[1:20:04] is controversial to some and maybe some
[1:20:06] get religiously upset if I say this
[1:20:09] but I don't believe brother Bham even
[1:20:12] saw immediately what was going on there
[1:20:14] because you read you know after the
[1:20:16] seals where brother Banham is expecting
[1:20:19] a new way of healing for the third pull
[1:20:22] it's very clear and and he makes
[1:20:24] statements like well maybe it will
[1:20:26] happen this
[1:20:28] and and and and God supernaturally
[1:20:31] changed that ministration. God
[1:20:33] supernaturally anointed his prophet now
[1:20:35] under the eagle anointing. He was
[1:20:37] already work walking in it. He had
[1:20:39] already opened the seals. He was already
[1:20:40] preaching the seventh seal completely
[1:20:42] open. Hallelujah. But the man part of
[1:20:44] him was still expecting because it went
[1:20:47] from from signing the hand to the
[1:20:48] discernment. He was expecting a new wave
[1:20:51] or a new way of healing. Hallelujah. And
[1:20:55] that was again I get myself in trouble
[1:20:58] here but praise the Lord. It's important
[1:21:00] we see these things brothers and
[1:21:01] sisters. I know this is not an
[1:21:02] evangelistic service but I believe it's
[1:21:04] going to help us.
[1:21:06] Now of course what I want to say is it's
[1:21:08] important to understand God has lap over
[1:21:10] times. You know if you look out in
[1:21:13] nature you don't sew a seed in the
[1:21:14] morning and the next day it's not jacked
[1:21:16] in the beantoalk. Amen. It just grows
[1:21:19] organically. and and with God also
[1:21:22] there's lap over times you know it's
[1:21:23] just nothing today and tomorrow
[1:21:25] everything it doesn't work like that
[1:21:27] amen so we understand that but again
[1:21:31] just to be very explicit with these
[1:21:33] things and and don't don't misquote me
[1:21:35] now if we have to put a date there when
[1:21:39] that change of administration happened I
[1:21:41] will say February March
[1:21:43] 1963 now remember I've I've I've
[1:21:46] preempted that by saying it's not just
[1:21:48] boom right there's his lapover periods.
[1:21:52] But but in in 1963, God changed the
[1:21:55] anointing on his prophet. Amen.
[1:22:01] But now there's some interesting
[1:22:03] implications of this. If we look at the
[1:22:05] end of 1962, brother Bram, you know,
[1:22:07] remember he saw the the the was it the
[1:22:10] dream or vision of the, you know, the
[1:22:11] the constellation of angels and so forth
[1:22:14] and he was really rattled by that and he
[1:22:16] preached, "Is this the time of the end,
[1:22:18] sir?"
[1:22:19] And when brother Brandon was preaching
[1:22:21] that that sermon, now remember 30
[1:22:23] December 1962 before the opening of the
[1:22:26] seals obviously because you know it was
[1:22:28] after that we actually had the
[1:22:29] experience and then he went back to the
[1:22:31] tabernacle and so forth. But brother
[1:22:33] Brandham in that message
[1:22:36] 1962 under the man
[1:22:40] anointing he made these statements.
[1:22:44] So what he does is he lists the
[1:22:48] mysteries or the loose ends that were
[1:22:51] restored. Can you know you know where
[1:22:53] I'm going with this? He says the serpent
[1:22:55] seed that's been a hidden mystery all
[1:22:56] through the years. The grace
[1:22:58] straightened out. Not disgrace but real
[1:23:00] to true grace. Not such a thing as a
[1:23:02] eternal burning hell. You'll burn for
[1:23:04] millions of years but anything that was
[1:23:06] eternal had never had a beginning or an
[1:23:07] end and hell was created. All these
[1:23:09] mysteries and he continues listing more.
[1:23:12] the mystery of the baptis baptism of the
[1:23:14] Holy Ghost without sensation but the
[1:23:16] person of Christ performing in you the
[1:23:18] same works that he did. Then he says the
[1:23:20] mystery of water baptism where the
[1:23:23] extreme trinitarianism has brought it
[1:23:25] into titles of father son and holy ghost
[1:23:27] and the mystery of the godhead being
[1:23:28] fulfilled in the baptism of the name of
[1:23:30] Jesus Christ according to the book of
[1:23:32] revelation that the church in this time
[1:23:34] was to receive. He says, "There is some
[1:23:36] of the
[1:23:37] mysteries." Now, end of
[1:23:40] 62, those things were clear. They were
[1:23:44] revealed.
[1:23:46] Under the man
[1:23:49] anointing. Okay, I don't get many amens.
[1:23:53] Do you agree what I'm saying?
[1:23:56] Okay, praise the Lord. So, so now think
[1:23:59] about this. Now it was not under the
[1:24:01] eagle anointing when those loose ends
[1:24:04] from the previous ages were called
[1:24:07] together and where those things were
[1:24:13] revealed. So those things were revealed
[1:24:17] under the first and second pool
[1:24:21] under the man age or church age
[1:24:24] anointing. So let's think about that
[1:24:26] now. the foundational doctrines. Now,
[1:24:29] you know, most of the time if someone
[1:24:30] asks you, well, what is the message?
[1:24:33] Well, I trust you past the point where
[1:24:34] you say long hair and long dresses. But
[1:24:37] then people say, well, baptism in Jesus'
[1:24:40] name, um, you know, serpent seed and so
[1:24:43] forth, some of those foundational
[1:24:44] quotes. Okay? Well, I'm going to
[1:24:47] challenge that today.
[1:24:49] Now I want you to
[1:24:52] understand you know I can so easily be
[1:24:55] misunderstood here. Those things are
[1:24:58] important. I am not for one
[1:25:00] moment you know wiping any of that off
[1:25:03] off of the table. Those are still the
[1:25:05] foundational basis of the things we
[1:25:08] believe. But really those are
[1:25:10] foundational things about actually about
[1:25:12] God's word in general about the gospel.
[1:25:15] Right. And and also today because God
[1:25:19] has taken us a step further than you
[1:25:21] know than Pentecost, than Wesley, than
[1:25:23] than than Luther, we don't wipe those
[1:25:25] things off. We still believe the just
[1:25:27] shall live by faith. Amen. We still
[1:25:29] believe the blood of Christ sanctifies
[1:25:31] us and he cleans us and we're washed by
[1:25:33] the waters of the word. We still believe
[1:25:35] in all those things. We still believe in
[1:25:36] the gifts in the church. We still
[1:25:38] believe that that, you know, God is the
[1:25:40] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[1:25:41] don't throw away everything. We believe
[1:25:44] all that plus. Amen. Amen. So, so you
[1:25:47] know when when I make these statements,
[1:25:49] please don't think I'm saying, well,
[1:25:50] we've moved beyond that, so you know,
[1:25:52] disregard those things. This is not what
[1:25:54] we're saying.
[1:25:57] So those truths, so so here's a big
[1:26:03] statement, but I believe
[1:26:05] it. Those mysteries that brother
[1:26:08] Brandham listed there were
[1:26:11] restored under a Pentecostal age.
[1:26:18] Okay, I see the wheels turning for
[1:26:21] many. It was under son of God anointing.
[1:26:24] It was in a church age anointing. It was
[1:26:26] not under the bride age. Amen. So
[1:26:30] therefore, it is part of what happened
[1:26:32] in Pentecost.
[1:26:35] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:39] Now, I'm either painting myself into a
[1:26:41] corner
[1:26:43] here or there's something we need to
[1:26:46] see. So, now, Brother Brandham refers to
[1:26:51] the the seed that had to go into the
[1:26:52] ground and go back into seed again. He
[1:26:55] says, "The first corn of wheat, the
[1:26:56] bridegroom, had to fall into the earth
[1:26:58] in order to rise again. So that the
[1:27:00] first bride that was born at Pentecost
[1:27:02] had to go through that dark ages like
[1:27:05] any other seed be buried. They had to
[1:27:08] die. They must do it. So now he's just
[1:27:10] speaking about, you know, he's really
[1:27:11] referring to the bride tree that had to,
[1:27:13] you know, die, go into the ground and
[1:27:15] and bring forth. Again, it's the
[1:27:17] parallel thing here. They had to die.
[1:27:19] They must do it. But it started
[1:27:20] sprouting again in Luther in the first
[1:27:22] reformation. It didn't look like the
[1:27:24] seed that went in, but it was the light
[1:27:26] of that day. The stalk then went on into
[1:27:28] the tassel Wesley and from the tassel it
[1:27:30] went into Pentecost. The shock.
[1:27:35] Okay, don't get
[1:27:37] offended. The prophet calls it the
[1:27:41] shock. What happens to the shock? Gets
[1:27:44] burnt.
[1:27:47] In the rapture message, Brother Brham
[1:27:49] makes this statement. He says, "From
[1:27:50] that come on up into the tassel, which
[1:27:52] was John Wesley, the great missionary
[1:27:54] age. It dropped back out of there. Come
[1:27:56] that deceiving age, the Pentecostal age.
[1:28:01] Okay. So, I trust I'm taking you along
[1:28:04] with me. I trust that your walls are not
[1:28:06] up yet. Amen. Keep on eating chicken.
[1:28:09] Praise the Lord. So, so now, Brother
[1:28:13] Brandham calls it the shock and now he's
[1:28:16] calling it the deceiving age. Now, he's
[1:28:17] not referring to when the when, you
[1:28:19] know, the Holy Ghost was poured out on
[1:28:20] the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago.
[1:28:22] He's speaking about the Pentecostal age
[1:28:24] or Ladya, right? That church age.
[1:28:28] Brother Ram says in another place he
[1:28:30] says, "Then along come the Pentecostals
[1:28:32] in the shock so much to deceive the
[1:28:37] elected." Strong statements, man.
[1:28:40] Pentecost to deceive the elected looked
[1:28:43] like a real grain of wheat. Open it up,
[1:28:46] there's no wheat at all. Let let me just
[1:28:49] say it straight out. It looked like the
[1:28:51] word was restored, but it wasn't. It
[1:28:55] wasn't back to the original seed, the
[1:28:57] spoken word. Again, there was a lot of
[1:28:59] noise. There was a lot of
[1:29:00] manifestations. There was a lot of stuff
[1:29:02] that went on. There was also a lot of
[1:29:04] copying. There was also a lot of false.
[1:29:07] I'm not saying everything is false.
[1:29:08] Don't misquote me now.
[1:29:10] But brothers and sisters, Pentecost and
[1:29:13] the Pentecostal experience, Brother
[1:29:15] Benham, actually when I say the
[1:29:17] Pentecostal experience, I'm not speaking
[1:29:18] about the true original one. Amen. But
[1:29:21] I'm speaking about under the the
[1:29:22] Lodessian Pentecostal expression. That's
[1:29:26] deceptive. Look like a real grain of
[1:29:28] wheat. Open it up. There's no wheat at
[1:29:30] all. But the life passing through the
[1:29:32] shock. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:36] So
[1:29:37] listen that deception that deceptive age
[1:29:42] brother Bham he actually he he's he's
[1:29:45] basically saying that that experience
[1:29:49] under lossia would be so close that it
[1:29:52] would deceive the very elected if it was
[1:29:59] possible. I love how he says it here.
[1:30:01] See here now how close she is. Close
[1:30:03] enough to deceive. Luther the stalk,
[1:30:05] Wesley the tassel, and Mary the shock or
[1:30:09] the womb or Pentecost. Amen. See how he
[1:30:12] calls causes it now? The shuck, the
[1:30:15] womb,
[1:30:17] Pentecost. It's so close. Remember the
[1:30:21] shuck is that little womb that the seed
[1:30:23] is being formed in. It's the
[1:30:26] environment. It's the safety. It's the
[1:30:29] place where the seed must form. But if
[1:30:32] you just look at the womb and there's no
[1:30:34] seed in there, I mean, then it's
[1:30:37] deceptive. Then you think, well, maybe
[1:30:40] maybe there's something. Well, maybe
[1:30:41] it's growing. Brother Ram says you can
[1:30:43] open that chuck up and you can take a a
[1:30:45] microscope. He says, I can't remember,
[1:30:47] you know, 100 times microscope or
[1:30:49] something. And he says, you can't see
[1:30:51] any seed in there. Hallelujah. Under
[1:30:55] Pentecost. So, so think about this now.
[1:30:59] bride today
[1:31:03] 2025 Pentecost so close it would deceive
[1:31:08] the very elected if
[1:31:10] possible. Now raise your hands. How many
[1:31:15] of you would be deceived easily by TD
[1:31:20] Jake, Joel
[1:31:21] Ostein, Joseph Prince, Benny Hinn, Joyce
[1:31:25] Meyers, Cre Flow dollar. Come on.
[1:31:29] Anyone think about this
[1:31:33] now? Pentecost deception
[1:31:38] today. Now, I hope those are not your
[1:31:40] favorite
[1:31:44] preachers. But there's something deeper
[1:31:46] in this than just thinking the
[1:31:49] charismatic movement.
[1:31:54] Yes.
[1:31:56] Those things are so obviously
[1:31:59] wrong. You know, if I accidentally sat
[1:32:02] on my remote and I saw a Joyce Meyers,
[1:32:05] you know, thing pop up on on on YouTube
[1:32:08] on my screen at home, it's not going to
[1:32:11] deceive me. Amen. Why? Because there's
[1:32:15] just no life in there. And I say that
[1:32:17] respectfully, brothers and sisters.
[1:32:20] Those things are so obviously wrong to
[1:32:22] the bride standing in the light of the
[1:32:24] word because it's money chasing. It's
[1:32:27] watered down. It is psychology. It is
[1:32:30] signing. It is not even a distraction.
[1:32:33] There's no there's no temptation there.
[1:32:36] There's no deception there.
[1:32:38] Amen. So, this is the part that is
[1:32:41] really sensitive. And I want you to open
[1:32:43] your heart before the Lord this morning.
[1:32:45] Pinch yourself. Brother Ram says, "Put
[1:32:47] your spiritual thinking caps
[1:32:49] on. The deception is closer." Amen.
[1:32:57] And and I and I want to say this
[1:32:58] carefully and with reverence, and don't
[1:33:00] misquote me or quote what I'm not
[1:33:04] saying, but you can believe the first
[1:33:07] and second pull of this
[1:33:10] message and be still under a Pentecostal
[1:33:13] anointing.
[1:33:19] Right? You can. There's where the
[1:33:22] deception comes
[1:33:25] in. Remember I showed you I showed how
[1:33:28] all those things were were already
[1:33:30] revealed under the man anointing. It was
[1:33:31] under Pentecost where all those truths
[1:33:34] were
[1:33:34] restored. It was it was it was under
[1:33:37] Lodia. It was under the church age
[1:33:39] anointing. It was under the man
[1:33:40] anointing where brother revealed serpent
[1:33:43] seed. God sent a prophet,
[1:33:46] right? You can believe God sent a
[1:33:49] prophet, brothers and sisters, but re re
[1:33:51] uh refuse to go on with the open word,
[1:33:55] refuse to go into the capstone, refuse
[1:33:57] to go under the eagle anointing, refuse
[1:33:59] to go into the bride age, refuse to come
[1:34:01] into go and remain in the darkness.
[1:34:05] I know this is strong words, my friends,
[1:34:07] and I'm not criticizing brother
[1:34:09] Brandham. I'm not nothing, don't get me
[1:34:11] wrong. But we can stay behind
[1:34:14] and be caught in darkness. And there's
[1:34:16] the deception. Amen. And you can say God
[1:34:19] sent a prophet and you can quote serpent
[1:34:21] seed. You can understand the the the
[1:34:23] baptism in Jesus name and and all those
[1:34:25] things. The the guided in the right way
[1:34:27] and still be deceived,
[1:34:30] stay behind.
[1:34:33] Hallelujah. The deceiving Pentecostal
[1:34:36] age is a lot closer than I think we've
[1:34:38] thought before.
[1:34:40] We can believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:34:42] yesterday and today and forever. We can
[1:34:44] believe the sign in the hand. We can
[1:34:46] believe the discernment. We can say he
[1:34:47] was a prophet. We can say it was a
[1:34:49] vindicated prophet. We can even quote
[1:34:51] the prophet. Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] Trust us, he's not making you uneasy
[1:34:56] unless the Holy Spirit needs to make you
[1:34:57] uneasy this morning. But that's still
[1:35:00] all under the restoration of the gifts.
[1:35:02] Remember when that angel came to brother
[1:35:05] Brandham the angel did not say you'll
[1:35:07] receive three gifts
[1:35:10] the angel said like Moses you will have
[1:35:12] two signs
[1:35:15] and those two signs is not so that
[1:35:18] everyone can rally around the signs.
[1:35:20] Amen. God did not gave Moses those two
[1:35:22] signs so that you know every time Moses
[1:35:24] go through the camp so that someone can
[1:35:25] say ah brother Moses I'm having a bad
[1:35:27] day just show me the sign again. Okay
[1:35:29] Moses put his hand in the bosom get the
[1:35:31] stick throw the stick. No. Amen. When
[1:35:34] the sign vindicated the word for their
[1:35:36] day, brothers and sisters, they should
[1:35:38] look away from the sign and look at
[1:35:40] where the sign was pointing. Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] Brother Brown preaches the message, the
[1:35:44] voice of the sign. Amen. God showed the
[1:35:47] sign so that we can hear the voice. And
[1:35:49] what did the voice say? Come up higher.
[1:35:52] Amen. The voice said, "Come up higher,
[1:35:54] my bride. Come away from Egypt. Come
[1:35:56] into Goan. Come away from Lotus here.
[1:35:58] Come into the bride age." Amen. Don't
[1:36:01] stay in the first and second pool. Come
[1:36:02] into the third pool. Come into the open
[1:36:04] word. Amen. And we're not we're not
[1:36:07] rallying around the sign the whole time.
[1:36:09] We're not rallying around. Praise the
[1:36:11] Lord. Oh, the healings are amazing. They
[1:36:13] were amazing. Absolutely. I'm not taking
[1:36:14] away from it. You understand what I'm
[1:36:16] saying? Amen. But we're not rallying
[1:36:18] around those things. God has given us
[1:36:20] those things to vindicate. That is where
[1:36:23] my word is flesh today.
[1:36:27] Hallelujah. God vindicated the message
[1:36:30] that would follow and he told us to
[1:36:33] believe the voice of the
[1:36:37] sign. Now I want to take that a step
[1:36:43] further. You can believe serpent
[1:36:47] seed
[1:36:49] grace. No such a thing as eternal hell.
[1:36:53] Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Water
[1:36:55] baptism. You can believe all those
[1:36:58] things, brothers and sisters. You can
[1:37:00] say, "Well, I'm in the
[1:37:03] message." And again, I it's impossible
[1:37:06] to humanly divide this. So, I just trust
[1:37:09] that the Holy Spirit will do that for
[1:37:10] you. But I don't want to say if you say,
[1:37:13] "I'm in the message because I believe
[1:37:14] those
[1:37:15] things." Well, maybe 50 years ago, you
[1:37:18] would have been in the
[1:37:20] message. Remember, because even though
[1:37:22] Brother Brham preached the the seventh
[1:37:24] seal open and brother Brandham revealed
[1:37:26] those things so beautifully, to the
[1:37:28] individual, those things were still
[1:37:30] mysteries. And it took years and years
[1:37:32] and years and years and years for God to
[1:37:34] slowly open up more and open up more and
[1:37:36] open up more. Amen. And there was a time
[1:37:40] where God winked at the ignorance of
[1:37:43] those things. Hallelujah. There was a
[1:37:45] time when all you needed was God sent a
[1:37:47] prophet. But that time is not today. The
[1:37:50] message has moved on. The revelation has
[1:37:53] moved on. God has given us more.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. And and brothers and
[1:37:57] sisters, I will say it's a sin today to
[1:37:59] to refuse to go on with more when God
[1:38:02] has given more. Hallelujah. Because
[1:38:04] that's exactly the same with the with
[1:38:06] the seven church ages. Hallelujah. When
[1:38:08] God showed more in in Wesley's age to
[1:38:11] remain under under Lutheran saying, "No,
[1:38:13] I have the message for age and I'm happy
[1:38:15] with you and I'm not going to move on."
[1:38:17] If they did not move on with the light,
[1:38:19] they were kickabot. Amen. When when
[1:38:22] Wesley's light came on and the more
[1:38:24] light was given, Amen. to stay in in in
[1:38:27] Luther's message would have been Kabot.
[1:38:29] There was no life there. The the the
[1:38:31] glorious departeth
[1:38:34] and I'm saying this fearfully this
[1:38:36] morning because I don't want to be
[1:38:38] blasphemous in these things, brothers
[1:38:40] and sisters. But we can say God sent a
[1:38:41] prophet, serpent, seed, and all those
[1:38:43] mysteries. And I want say if that's
[1:38:45] where you stay, the glory is departed.
[1:38:49] The glory is now moved into a place
[1:38:51] where the bride is caught up into a
[1:38:53] union with Christ. And you cannot no
[1:38:56] longer stand and rally around God sent a
[1:38:58] prophet, God sent a prophet, God sent a
[1:39:00] prophet, and just quoting what the
[1:39:01] prophet says. Hallelujah. That personal
[1:39:05] individual revelation of the seventh
[1:39:07] seal which calls us personally up into
[1:39:10] the union with Christ, that's what we
[1:39:12] need for this hour.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. And that's what the eagle
[1:39:16] anointing is. That's what we get in this
[1:39:19] age. That's where the overcoming power
[1:39:20] lies today to understand who we are.
[1:39:23] Amen. To get the revelation of who we
[1:39:26] are in him.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah.
[1:39:29] So if you say, I'm in the message
[1:39:30] because I believe those things. Wrong.
[1:39:34] Wrong answer. Amen. That is not where
[1:39:36] life is lying today. It's deception. And
[1:39:39] it's so close it could deceive the very
[1:39:41] elected if it was possible. Amen.
[1:39:46] Trust that I'm not hurting anyone's
[1:39:47] feelings here, brothers and
[1:39:50] sisters. Amen. If we refuse the
[1:39:53] bridegroom is here, if we refuse that
[1:39:55] the seventh seal is open, if we refuse
[1:39:57] to believe that we're in the rapturing
[1:40:00] process, if we refuse to believe the
[1:40:03] mighty angel has come down and has
[1:40:05] handed the book to the prophet and that
[1:40:07] that the mighty angel, I mean, that
[1:40:09] Christ, the three-fold mystery of God
[1:40:11] has been revealed to
[1:40:12] us. If we refuse to eat that book to go
[1:40:17] on with the word to become the book,
[1:40:19] Amen.
[1:40:20] If we refuse those things, we're in the
[1:40:23] shock. Amen. Not seed. I'm not saying
[1:40:27] that you are not seed, but you need to
[1:40:28] move on into the seed. Amen. Come up
[1:40:31] into the capstone. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:34] That still puts you under a man
[1:40:37] anointing. You can't claim to be under
[1:40:39] the eagle anointing and still say,
[1:40:41] "Today, the seventh seal is closed. I'm
[1:40:43] sorry." You cannot.
[1:40:46] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] Now, now there's something else I want
[1:40:52] to say, and this is something that I
[1:40:53] realized the church
[1:40:56] uh over the last few months. We've had
[1:40:58] questions and answers on on Wednesday
[1:41:00] nights. Um my church is here, so so they
[1:41:03] would be witness to those things. And
[1:41:05] what I realized in so many of the
[1:41:07] questions that were answered is that
[1:41:10] there were scarecrows.
[1:41:13] There's so many scarecrows where over
[1:41:15] the years as God revealed things, there
[1:41:17] were so many people, don't believe
[1:41:19] perusia, don't say perua or don't say
[1:41:22] thunders, it's a bad thing, right? And
[1:41:25] there were so many scarecrows. There
[1:41:27] were so many, oh, don't believe that
[1:41:28] because then you're going to go off in
[1:41:29] that deep end and don't believe that
[1:41:31] because and people gather all these
[1:41:33] scarecrows so that people are eventually
[1:41:35] so afraid to believe the open word
[1:41:37] because somebody 20 years ago said,
[1:41:39] "Don't believe that." But it was not
[1:41:40] open to that somebody 20 years ago. And
[1:41:42] maybe God showed that somebody
[1:41:44] afterwards, but they never had the
[1:41:46] opportunity to come back to you and say,
[1:41:48] "Well, I God showed me more." But I want
[1:41:50] to say, brothers and sisters, God has
[1:41:52] given us more today. Hallelujah. May God
[1:41:55] give us grace. May God break down those
[1:41:57] scarecrows. Amen. We are so scared to
[1:42:00] believe the word. We're so scared
[1:42:02] because, oh, this one has warned me
[1:42:04] about that brother and this one has
[1:42:06] warned me about that doctrine. And amen.
[1:42:08] The Holy Spirit will lead us. He's the
[1:42:11] inner teacher. Amen. And I want to say,
[1:42:13] brothers and sisters, cry out with me.
[1:42:15] Lord, I want everything you have for me.
[1:42:17] Brother Ram says, "Pray for revelation
[1:42:19] more than anything else."
[1:42:21] Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] Let's move on. Brother says, "Man always
[1:42:28] gives God praise for the things he did
[1:42:29] in the past, look forward to the things
[1:42:31] he will do in the future, but miss what
[1:42:33] he's doing today. And today is no
[1:42:36] different. 2024 is no different." Amen.
[1:42:40] Many times us as people, we place things
[1:42:42] into the
[1:42:44] future. Hallelujah. Hey, listen. If you
[1:42:47] just to make this really practical,
[1:42:50] those Pharisees, those scribes, those
[1:42:51] people in in Jesus's time, the Messiah
[1:42:54] was there, but they were looking for the
[1:42:56] Messiah. Amen. They were putting it in
[1:42:58] the future. This can't be the Messiah.
[1:42:59] We're looking for the Messiah. No. When
[1:43:01] the holy one will come, he will, like
[1:43:03] brother Rand describes, he will roll out
[1:43:04] a red carpet and he will come with the
[1:43:06] angelic choir and the trumpets blowing
[1:43:08] and would walk down and say, "Caosis,
[1:43:10] here I am." Amen. That's the picture
[1:43:13] that they had. They might not have said
[1:43:14] it in many those words, but that's
[1:43:16] subconsciously the idea that they had.
[1:43:19] And we've got the same problem today.
[1:43:22] Amen. man makes up uh ideas or we bring
[1:43:27] ideas from our family culture, our
[1:43:29] church culture, the churches we come
[1:43:30] back from. Sometimes we get ideas just
[1:43:33] by reading a children's Bible. I'm not
[1:43:35] against children's Bibles at all. I
[1:43:37] benefited hugely by by mom reading us
[1:43:40] from the children's Bible as kids. I'm
[1:43:42] still thankful to God for those things
[1:43:43] today. But sometimes some of those
[1:43:45] pictures give us a wrong mental
[1:43:47] impression and without knowing it we
[1:43:49] hold on to those things for years and
[1:43:51] years and years and we try and fit that
[1:43:52] in and fit that in and fit that in until
[1:43:54] God comes and breaks down those those
[1:43:56] stones and to remove them so that we can
[1:43:58] see actually that stone in one of those
[1:44:01] bottom layers is wrong. And then God
[1:44:02] needs to remove that stone and replace
[1:44:05] it with a right stone and then the
[1:44:06] building can go on. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:44:10] God promised the Messiah would come. God
[1:44:12] prophesied it through so many prophets
[1:44:14] and so forth. And when Jesus came in
[1:44:17] perfect fulfillment in of that prophecy
[1:44:19] and every promise, the very people who
[1:44:21] were looking for him to come,
[1:44:24] the chosen nation of God, I mean, the
[1:44:27] people who dedicated their lives to
[1:44:29] studying the Torah, who were singing the
[1:44:31] Psalms in the temple, like brother Ram
[1:44:32] says, they were singing David's psalm in
[1:44:34] the temple. My God, my God, why? All
[1:44:37] those things. And Jesus was doing the
[1:44:38] reality on the cross and they missed it
[1:44:40] because they were expecting it
[1:44:42] differently.
[1:44:43] Amen. They missed him because he didn't
[1:44:46] come according to their interpretation.
[1:44:49] They wanted God to fit in their box into
[1:44:53] their understanding into their
[1:44:55] intellectual interpretation of how it
[1:44:57] was supposed to come. And we do the
[1:45:00] same.
[1:45:02] Amen.
[1:45:03] The very people of God missed the first
[1:45:06] coming of the son of man because of
[1:45:08] their interpretation of the message. And
[1:45:10] obviously I'm saying that as a type of
[1:45:12] today. Instead of just believing the
[1:45:15] message, they try to run ahead of God
[1:45:17] and figure out how it was supposed to
[1:45:19] happen before it happened. I mean, but
[1:45:21] what does brother Brandham show us so
[1:45:23] clearly? God reveals his word by
[1:45:26] bringing it to pass. Amen. So all we can
[1:45:28] do, brothers and sisters, is eat the
[1:45:30] word and relax.
[1:45:32] And the Holy Spirit will reveal to us.
[1:45:35] He sovereignly reveals to us. Amen. His
[1:45:39] thoughts are higher than our thoughts. I
[1:45:41] mean, God's ways are higher than our
[1:45:42] ways. And with our human thinking, we
[1:45:44] could never reach up into prophet
[1:45:46] prophecy and interpret it right with our
[1:45:49] human reasoning. We cannot. Amen. We
[1:45:52] will always misinterpret it.
[1:45:56] But God is his own interpreter and he
[1:45:58] will bring it to pass exactly as he saw
[1:46:01] it before the foundation of the earth.
[1:46:03] And no matter how much we try to
[1:46:05] interpret it for him, he's not obliged
[1:46:07] to come come according to our
[1:46:09] interpretation. He's only committed to
[1:46:11] his original plan.
[1:46:15] Hallelujah. So you know what that does?
[1:46:17] It takes off all the pressure.
[1:46:20] Amen.
[1:46:21] Sometimes you know even ministers we
[1:46:23] sometimes put pressure on one another to
[1:46:25] understand something or come up with the
[1:46:27] goods or you know what do you think
[1:46:28] about this or what do you think about
[1:46:29] that and sometimes it's lovely to to you
[1:46:31] know sit and discuss and fellowship and
[1:46:33] say well I think maybe it can be it
[1:46:35] looks like and so forth and there's
[1:46:36] nothing wrong with that brothers and
[1:46:38] sisters but always leave a comma after
[1:46:41] your statement and say but God can
[1:46:44] change me God can give me more
[1:46:46] understanding and so forth because he is
[1:46:48] the interpreter and he will bring it to
[1:46:50] us.
[1:46:54] Hallelujah. One of our biggest struggles
[1:46:56] is our denominational interpretations
[1:46:59] that we brought with us.
[1:47:02] And sometimes it's is it's just
[1:47:05] sometimes there's natural cultures that
[1:47:07] influence these things or or you know
[1:47:09] all sorts of influences on our life.
[1:47:11] Sometimes it's just our makeup and so
[1:47:14] forth. And what we do, it's like every
[1:47:18] other person in the world, they do
[1:47:20] exactly the same thing. You surround
[1:47:22] yourself by people who agree with what
[1:47:24] you say, right? So then if me and my
[1:47:28] little groupy, we all say the same
[1:47:29] thing, then it's got to be right because
[1:47:31] everyone says it. No, it's just everyone
[1:47:33] in your
[1:47:34] groupy, right?
[1:47:38] That's how it that's I mean, Google
[1:47:40] knows how to work this.
[1:47:42] Amen. Satan knows how to play this game.
[1:47:46] And in the meanwhile, he's dividing and
[1:47:48] conquering because he's building up all
[1:47:50] sorts of groupies. Let's ask the Holy
[1:47:52] Spirit to break down those little
[1:47:53] groupies. Let's all just align with the
[1:47:56] word. And when we come to a place where
[1:47:58] we recognize, I was wrong. Praise the
[1:47:59] Lord. He showed me more. Not I'm going
[1:48:02] to defend it because of my pride. But
[1:48:04] that's what we do unfortunately so
[1:48:07] often. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:48:09] Amen. Let's just speak of some of those
[1:48:11] groups. This is just interesting. You
[1:48:13] know, in the time of Jesus when he was
[1:48:14] on earth, there was all those religious
[1:48:16] groups. They were a Sanhedrin. But in
[1:48:18] that Sanhedrin, there were so many
[1:48:19] others that were, you know, part of it.
[1:48:22] Pharisees, Sadducees, Zeilots,
[1:48:24] Herodians, Essenes, and so
[1:48:26] on. But there was one thing they agreed
[1:48:29] on except for a few elected ones. They
[1:48:33] believe this Jesus is false. Amen.
[1:48:38] All these other things we don't agree
[1:48:40] on, but this guy cannot be the son of
[1:48:42] man. This one cannot be. Hallelujah. But
[1:48:46] there was a Joseph and a Mary and there
[1:48:48] was different ones. An Nicodemus and a
[1:48:51] Joseph of Arythea and so
[1:48:54] on. Let's just briefly look at some of
[1:48:57] those. So for interest sake, the
[1:49:00] Sadducees. Now I I never can get my head
[1:49:03] around the Sadducees.
[1:49:05] They did not believe in eternity. They
[1:49:08] did not believe in a life after
[1:49:10] death. Their only focus was to keep
[1:49:13] their religious status. They were
[1:49:15] responsible to look after the temple and
[1:49:17] the temple services and all those
[1:49:19] things. And they were just there to keep
[1:49:21] their position. They were typically rich
[1:49:23] people. I mean, come on. Why have a
[1:49:26] religion if you don't believe in life
[1:49:27] after death? I just cannot get my head
[1:49:29] around it. Like, there's something
[1:49:31] missing there, right? But the focus of
[1:49:34] their belief system was just to keep the
[1:49:35] priesthood together and preserve their
[1:49:37] influence and their position and so on.
[1:49:40] Then there's the Essins and they they
[1:49:43] were the exact opposite. They saw the
[1:49:45] temple system as corrupt and all sorts
[1:49:47] and they focused on purity and communal
[1:49:50] living and and all those kind of things
[1:49:52] and um according to thus sayaith Google
[1:49:56] they had all sorts of uh apocalyptic
[1:50:00] expectations in in other words you know
[1:50:02] they were probably saying you know we're
[1:50:04] already in the millennium or you know
[1:50:05] things like
[1:50:07] that and the point I'm making is we have
[1:50:10] the same things inside the message
[1:50:12] today. Amen. I mean, I'm not saying that
[1:50:15] just just as a, you know, put off on
[1:50:17] someone, but I've got I've got cousins
[1:50:19] who believe that that they already in
[1:50:22] the millennium. I mean, what a
[1:50:24] disappointment. What the disappointment.
[1:50:27] And then, of course, the Pharisees.
[1:50:29] Pharisees, actors, legalists,
[1:50:31] pretenders, hypocrites.
[1:50:35] Amen. Making it look like they are so
[1:50:37] perfect and holy. We've got all these in
[1:50:40] the message. The Herodians, the
[1:50:43] Herodians, all they were about was
[1:50:45] trying to align themselves with the
[1:50:47] leadership and trying to politically
[1:50:48] gain something from it. And then the
[1:50:51] Zeilots again, overthrow Rome and we'll,
[1:50:54] you know, take Rome by force and so
[1:50:56] forth, but not stand back and let God in
[1:50:58] his time deal with it. Amen. And and the
[1:51:02] reason I'm saying this, brothers and
[1:51:03] sisters, you might think, "Oh, this is
[1:51:04] very very special for a message sermon."
[1:51:07] But the point is people are made up
[1:51:11] differently. And we look at scriptures,
[1:51:13] we look at quotes, we look at different
[1:51:16] things from our own perspectives and
[1:51:18] from very very widely varying
[1:51:21] perspectives and and lenses. And then we
[1:51:24] interpret every promise. We interpret,
[1:51:27] you know, every every quote and every
[1:51:29] prophecy. We ex we interpret it through
[1:51:31] our own understandings, through our own
[1:51:34] backgrounds, but many times through our
[1:51:36] own
[1:51:37] needs. Sometimes we interpret promises
[1:51:40] in the Bible through our own motives
[1:51:42] because we want to achieve
[1:51:44] something. We do the same thing today
[1:51:47] when I say you have we have these kind
[1:51:49] of things in every church where people
[1:51:51] hear the message through our own
[1:51:53] filters. And obviously that's the point
[1:51:56] I'm making. May God today break filters
[1:52:00] down. Amen. So we can just look at it
[1:52:03] and say, "Lord, you reveal to me what
[1:52:05] you want."
[1:52:07] Amen.
[1:52:10] I'm just going to briefly look at I
[1:52:12] won't be too much longer, but I just
[1:52:13] want to briefly look at a few things
[1:52:14] that we so easily place in the
[1:52:17] future. Let's go to one
[1:52:20] that's ironically still in dispute some
[1:52:23] some
[1:52:24] places. Revelation five. People want to
[1:52:27] keep Christ sitting on the throne and
[1:52:30] the book
[1:52:31] closed. Amen. How can you put Revelation
[1:52:35] 5 in the future? If Revelation 5 is in
[1:52:38] the future, well, then you still have a
[1:52:39] closed book. Then the seals are
[1:52:41] definitely not open. You cannot have the
[1:52:44] seals open and the book's still closed.
[1:52:47] I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean,
[1:52:49] even even the English language doesn't
[1:52:50] make sense. We need to see, brothers and
[1:52:53] sisters, the lamb has gotten up from the
[1:52:55] throne. He has taken the book. He has
[1:52:57] loosened the seals. The song said, "Thou
[1:53:00] was." Amen. Thou was worthy. Thou hast
[1:53:04] open the seals and so forth. That's the
[1:53:06] song we sing. Revelation 10. Revelation
[1:53:09] 10 is not in the future, brothers and
[1:53:10] sisters. There's a portion of Revelation
[1:53:13] 10 that's 60 years in the past. I mean,
[1:53:16] that seventh angel came, that seventh
[1:53:19] earthly messenger came. He was on earth.
[1:53:22] He did receive the book out of the hand
[1:53:24] of the mighty angel. Amen. And then John
[1:53:27] was instructed to take that book out of
[1:53:29] his hand. And then the the bride is
[1:53:31] instructed to take that book, eat the
[1:53:33] book, become the book, prophesy again,
[1:53:35] express that book, live that book.
[1:53:38] Hallelujah. I mean, that's where we're
[1:53:40] living right now. That's not something
[1:53:42] in the future, brothers and sisters.
[1:53:44] The third pool, well, I've I've dealt
[1:53:46] with that extensively. The third pool is
[1:53:48] not in the future. Amen. We read quotes
[1:53:50] and we think that, you know, when the
[1:53:52] third pool is going to come, there's
[1:53:53] going to be some mighty um, you know,
[1:53:56] things happen. Well, the third pool is
[1:53:57] here. We're living in the third pool.
[1:54:00] And when the need arises, God will
[1:54:01] anoint the bride to do whatever is
[1:54:03] necessary. Amen. Jesus Christ is the
[1:54:05] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:54:07] if there's circumstances that is going
[1:54:10] to require us to speak rain or to speak,
[1:54:13] praise God. But God can do it today. The
[1:54:15] third pool is here. The bride is here.
[1:54:18] Amen. with the bride is under the under
[1:54:20] the anointing of that eagle under the
[1:54:22] third
[1:54:23] pool. Praise the
[1:54:25] Lord. Brother Random had those those he
[1:54:29] discussed that that dream of that
[1:54:31] brother riding this trail again and so
[1:54:33] forth. Amen. The same Holy Spirit, the
[1:54:37] same anointing, the same life, the same
[1:54:38] word in flesh that was in brother
[1:54:40] Brandham is now on the bride. Yes,
[1:54:44] God is riding this trail again. Amen.
[1:54:47] Let's not look to something in the
[1:54:49] future. God is riding the straight
[1:54:51] again. What about the bride's revival?
[1:54:53] Brother Brandham says, I can show you a
[1:54:55] quote. The bride has not had a revival
[1:54:57] yet. Well, that's now history.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah. I'm in the bride's revival.
[1:55:02] The word revival is here. I mean, the
[1:55:05] word is open. Hallelujah. Don't misquote
[1:55:09] or quote the the the quote that's now
[1:55:11] history is still as future, brothers and
[1:55:13] sisters. I mean, we're not looking
[1:55:15] forward to the bride's revival. We are
[1:55:17] the bride's revival. I mean, that's why
[1:55:19] brother Brandham said about that little
[1:55:20] cockney who says when they asked him
[1:55:22] where, you know, can you tell us where's
[1:55:24] the where's the Welsh revival? And he
[1:55:25] said, well, you're looking at it. Amen.
[1:55:27] We can say today, can you tell me
[1:55:29] where's the bride's revival? You're
[1:55:30] looking at it. Hallelujah. You're
[1:55:33] looking at the word in flesh today. Oh,
[1:55:35] brother, you don't look like the word to
[1:55:36] me. I don't care what you say. By
[1:55:38] revelation, I am part of him. By
[1:55:40] revelation, I was part of him from
[1:55:42] before the foundation of the earth. By
[1:55:44] revelation, he is taking me through
[1:55:46] every step. He's revealing what I need.
[1:55:48] He's giving me all the spiritual
[1:55:50] vitamins that I need for the battle of
[1:55:51] every single day. And I don't care what
[1:55:53] you see. I don't care what the accuser
[1:55:56] says against me. I don't care what
[1:55:58] anyone says. Hallelujah. He showed me by
[1:56:01] revelation. I am a son of God. That's
[1:56:04] why brother Ram could make the
[1:56:05] statement, I'm not the son of Chelsea
[1:56:07] Braram. God showed me that's not my
[1:56:09] where my where my life comes from. My
[1:56:12] true life comes from heaven. My true
[1:56:14] life in in that revelation I say I come
[1:56:17] from God. I go back to God. In the
[1:56:18] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:56:20] God and the word was with God and I was
[1:56:22] part of that word. That same part of
[1:56:24] that logos was part of me. Amen. My
[1:56:26] theophony was part of that in the
[1:56:28] beginning word.
[1:56:32] Amen. Heavenly places. I'm just going to
[1:56:35] skip over some of
[1:56:37] this. My message this morning, brothers
[1:56:39] and sisters, is let's not put things in
[1:56:42] the future that's happening today.
[1:56:43] Celebrate what God is doing today.
[1:56:46] Embrace it. Believe it. Ask God to make
[1:56:48] it real. If it's not real to you, you
[1:56:50] can't make it real to yourself, but ask
[1:56:52] God. That's why Brother Ram says, "Pray
[1:56:54] for revelation more than anything."
[1:56:56] Let's pray for revelation. Let's do what
[1:56:58] he says. Amen. Ask God to make it real.
[1:57:03] I want to ask you something and this
[1:57:04] this is something to just I I just
[1:57:07] thought about when I was preparing this
[1:57:10] week. Brother Rams made many times how
[1:57:15] if God had given him a choice which age
[1:57:17] he want to live in. He says I would
[1:57:20] choose this age. He said it would have
[1:57:21] been wonderful to be on earth in the
[1:57:23] time of Jesus to see all the all the
[1:57:25] miracles and hear him teach and hear him
[1:57:27] explain those things. But brothers and
[1:57:30] sisters, they were still looking in a
[1:57:31] glass darkly with Jesus Christ the word
[1:57:34] there because it was not time for the
[1:57:36] revelation of the things we see.
[1:57:39] Hallelujah. But we are so privileged
[1:57:42] that we can now look back over 2,000
[1:57:44] years and say, "Yes, that happened
[1:57:46] according to the prophecy. That happened
[1:57:47] according to the prophecy. That happened
[1:57:49] to the according to the prophecy." Now,
[1:57:51] John didn't write, "Well, it will be,
[1:57:52] you know, Paul, Ireneius, Martin, and so
[1:57:54] forth." He did not write those things.
[1:57:55] But by the characteristic of those
[1:57:57] things today we had a prophet that came
[1:57:59] and placed it and that one was Paul and
[1:58:01] that one was Ireneius and that one was
[1:58:02] Martin and that one was Columba and we
[1:58:04] see the whole picture unfolding such a
[1:58:06] blessed thing but don't just look all
[1:58:08] the way to brother Brandon we need to
[1:58:09] look at today what God is doing today
[1:58:13] the the word is moving on today so I
[1:58:15] want to challenge you with this this is
[1:58:16] the thought that came to me if I had to
[1:58:19] choose would I want to live in brother
[1:58:21] Brandham's day or in this day
[1:58:24] I take first day any day my friends
[1:58:27] because those people sat in brother
[1:58:29] Brandham's services but the the the
[1:58:31] curtain of revelation or whatever
[1:58:33] symbology or type you want to use wasn't
[1:58:35] open yet that's why brother Brandham
[1:58:37] could ask I think it was Billy Paul
[1:58:39] after the service Billy did you
[1:58:40] understand what I was saying yes dad
[1:58:42] Billy did you understand what I was
[1:58:44] saying no dad mean people were sitting
[1:58:46] there and there was an anointing and
[1:58:48] there was an experience and and they
[1:58:49] were excited and people said we never
[1:58:51] sat under an anointing like we sat there
[1:58:54] But they didn't get it because it wasn't
[1:58:56] God's time.
[1:58:59] Today is the day of revelation of those
[1:59:02] things that that prophet preached.
[1:59:04] Hallelujah. I would rather live today
[1:59:06] than in
[1:59:07] 1963. I would rather live today than
[1:59:12] 6465.
[1:59:15] Hallelujah. I'm just going to I'll just
[1:59:17] refer to this in passing. I'm not going
[1:59:20] to read the scriptures and things, but
[1:59:23] Jesus spoke about that pearl of great
[1:59:25] prize. He says, "If you find the pearl
[1:59:28] of great prize, you sell everything you
[1:59:30] have and you dedicate everything to this
[1:59:33] thing." Brothers and sisters, this word
[1:59:35] that we've received, it is the pearl of
[1:59:37] great prize.
[1:59:39] Hallelujah. Amen. This is worth selling
[1:59:43] out everything for. Amen. This message
[1:59:47] is the most precious thing that can ever
[1:59:49] happen to us.
[1:59:51] Hallelujah. I want to encourage you,
[1:59:53] brothers and
[1:59:54] sisters. I'm so thankful that God has
[1:59:56] revealed it to
[1:59:58] us. I'm going to go back to our opening
[2:00:07] scripture. Jesus made the statement in
[2:00:09] Matthew 24. Now remember, Matthew 24 is
[2:00:12] prophecy about the future from where
[2:00:13] Jesus stood. Except those days should be
[2:00:16] shortened, there should be no flesh be
[2:00:18] saved, but for the elect's sake, those
[2:00:20] days shall be
[2:00:22] shortened. And then he goes on and he
[2:00:24] says, "But where the carcass is, the
[2:00:27] eagles will
[2:00:29] gather." Where is the carcass today? The
[2:00:31] word. Amen. Where is the carcass today?
[2:00:34] The carcass today, my friends, is not
[2:00:36] God sent a prophet. That's yesterday's
[2:00:40] manner. Amen. Don't be offended at me.
[2:00:43] The carcass
[2:00:45] today, the bride will know who she is.
[2:00:49] If this bride knows who she is, she will
[2:00:52] one day, then the rapture will go.
[2:00:57] The revelation of who you are is being
[2:00:59] revealed
[2:01:01] now. Amen. It wasn't revealed in 63 to
[2:01:06] the bride.
[2:01:08] I trust you're not misquing me there.
[2:01:10] But God is revealing in this day who we
[2:01:14] are. God is making the word alive to us
[2:01:18] in this day. Amen. But brothers and
[2:01:21] sisters, we can't sympathize with this
[2:01:23] word only. We must sell out everything.
[2:01:26] Amen. Amen. God is God is wooing this
[2:01:30] bride to become one with him to come
[2:01:33] into full union with him to come into
[2:01:35] full submission of his headship giving
[2:01:38] him total and complete preeminence.
[2:01:40] Amen. And even if you don't understand
[2:01:44] it, believe it.
[2:01:46] Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] You know, we can refer to the rich young
[2:01:50] ruler and different ones. He was in the
[2:01:52] message. He learned about the word. He
[2:01:54] tried by human effort to keep the letter
[2:01:56] of the word. But there were things that
[2:01:58] he held dearer than the pearl of great
[2:02:01] price.
[2:02:03] Amen. Many people want the benefit of
[2:02:06] redemption, but they don't want the
[2:02:07] surrender. They want a savior, but not a
[2:02:10] lord.
[2:02:12] In other words, a lukewarm lodic
[2:02:15] condition, not fully sold
[2:02:18] out. Hallelujah. But remember that rich
[2:02:21] young ruler in the time that he least
[2:02:23] expected when his bonds were full when
[2:02:26] things were going so well with him
[2:02:28] naturally he opened up his eyes in hell.
[2:02:31] Amen. Don't put off your full surrender.
[2:02:36] Tomorrow might be too late. Maybe the
[2:02:37] musicians can come.
[2:02:40] I just want to say this brothers and
[2:02:42] sisters. I just want to bring this
[2:02:43] thought together. I don't want to leave
[2:02:44] this hanging. Remember I started off by
[2:02:48] saying God has drawn a
[2:02:52] map and there was no age like this one
[2:02:55] where we can actually see where we're at
[2:02:58] on the map. You see the problem is if
[2:03:01] you if you give someone a map in the
[2:03:04] hand, it doesn't help them at all.
[2:03:08] Okay, get what I'm saying? You see a
[2:03:10] map, what's the first thing you ask?
[2:03:13] Where am I? Amen. You get into a
[2:03:16] shopping center, there's always a, you
[2:03:17] know, big red arrow sometimes and it
[2:03:19] says, "You are here." Now, the previous
[2:03:22] church ages, they had the map. They had
[2:03:24] the map. They had the map, but they had
[2:03:25] no idea where they were at on the map.
[2:03:27] They don't didn't even have a revelation
[2:03:28] of what the map means. Today, we have
[2:03:31] such a perspective of the map. We saw
[2:03:34] how all those different church ages pl
[2:03:37] panned out and we saw who the, you know,
[2:03:39] the messengers were and we saw what the
[2:03:40] anointings were behind it. And we saw
[2:03:42] all those things, brothers and sisters.
[2:03:44] And God showed us, you're right here at
[2:03:46] the end. Where you're at on the map is
[2:03:50] right there in the headstone. Wonder if
[2:03:53] I've got
[2:03:56] the Let me just go
[2:03:58] back. There we
[2:04:00] go. You are
[2:04:03] here. Amen. I trust you can say today,
[2:04:07] I'm not in ladies here. I'm not out in
[2:04:09] Egypt. Amen. God has shown us we are
[2:04:13] here. And because he's shown us we are
[2:04:15] here at the end of time, at the brink of
[2:04:18] time, at at this place where where this
[2:04:20] earth will be burnt and we're going to
[2:04:22] walk out on the ashes of the wicked. But
[2:04:25] the thing that is that is so special to
[2:04:27] us, brothers and sisters. We know we're
[2:04:29] right here at this point where the bride
[2:04:32] is becoming one with the groom and where
[2:04:35] the next thing that is going to happen
[2:04:37] for us is go he's taking us into a
[2:04:39] marriage supper. He's taking us to the
[2:04:42] feast. Hallelujah. And while we're in
[2:04:44] the feast then is the great tribulation
[2:04:46] on earth when God reveals himself to the
[2:04:48] Jews and so forth. And after that three
[2:04:50] and a half years then he takes us on a
[2:04:53] honeymoon. Praise God. Because we know
[2:04:55] where we at on the map. We know that's
[2:04:56] what's going
[2:04:58] next. But at the same time, there's a
[2:05:00] warning, brothers and
[2:05:03] sisters. Don't be part of that
[2:05:06] deception. Don't be the chaff that is
[2:05:08] burned. Don't be the one that is left
[2:05:12] behind. Knowing we were out on the
[2:05:15] map is still not enough if you don't
[2:05:19] submit to where the directions tell you
[2:05:21] to go
[2:05:22] next. Hallelujah. You can still end up
[2:05:25] in the wrong
[2:05:26] place.
[2:05:28] Hallelujah. God swore by himself in this
[2:05:31] age, there shall be time no
[2:05:35] longer. And brothers and sisters, that
[2:05:37] is not something in the future. We're at
[2:05:41] the place in history where time has run
[2:05:44] out.
[2:05:46] Don't be caught up in just a lukewarm
[2:05:48] Pentecostal
[2:05:49] leodyia life where the church is
[2:05:52] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked,
[2:05:54] and don't know it. Sell out. God says,
[2:05:57] "Come buy of me." Amen.
[2:06:00] Amen. Gold, tried in the fire, and so
[2:06:03] forth without money and without price. I
[2:06:06] mean, let's just stand
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:10] together. If the Lord is speaking to
[2:06:12] your heart this morning, let's just all
[2:06:13] close our eyes. So if the Lord is
[2:06:15] speaking to your
[2:06:18] heart, maybe you you want to respond to
[2:06:21] the Lord and say, "Lord, I need more
[2:06:25] revelation or I need a fuller
[2:06:29] surrender. I don't want to be like that
[2:06:31] rich young ruler that just looked at all
[2:06:34] the successes of life and did not
[2:06:37] recognize my time is running out."
[2:06:40] If that's you this morning, you can
[2:06:42] express it to the Lord with an uplifted
[2:06:43] hand as we
[2:06:47] pray. Most precious and loving
[2:06:54] Father, Lord, I know many statements
[2:06:57] were made that could be taken wrong,
[2:07:00] Father. I just place it in your
[2:07:05] hand, oh Lord. But when you departed
[2:07:07] 2,000 years ago, you said that you will
[2:07:10] send the teacher and he will make these
[2:07:12] things known to us,
[2:07:14] Father. Lord, in this morning, Lord, I
[2:07:17] want to pray that that inner teacher,
[2:07:19] Father, will go beyond every barrier,
[2:07:22] every defensive wall, every preconceived
[2:07:25] idea, oh, every scarecrow, Lord, and
[2:07:29] reveal to us where we are, where we're
[2:07:31] at, Lord. Oh father, in this morning I
[2:07:35] want to lift up my hands with my
[2:07:36] brothers and sisters, Lord, and say,
[2:07:38] "Father, I need more of you. I need more
[2:07:43] revelation. Oh, Father, I need to see
[2:07:47] who I am,
[2:07:49] Lord. Father, help us, Lord, not to stay
[2:07:52] behind in in the shock,
[2:07:55] Father. For Lord, your pro prophet
[2:07:57] speaks about it's the coming of the
[2:08:01] combine. We're in the harvest time,
[2:08:04] Lord. Let us be ready,
[2:08:07] Father. Lord Jesus, I pray that your
[2:08:10] spirit will work on hearts even now,
[2:08:15] Father, Lord. Have your
[2:08:22] way, Lord Jesus. I pray that you will
[2:08:24] draw every eagle to you, Father.
[2:08:28] Oh Lord Jesus, I pray Lord if there's
[2:08:31] still a bride member, an elected seed
[2:08:33] sitting in Lotia, sitting in go in in
[2:08:36] Egypt, Father, that you will call that
[2:08:38] seed up higher. Father, reveal
[2:08:42] yourself. Thank you,
[2:08:44] Lord. We give you all the glory and we
[2:08:47] ask these things in the precious name of
[2:08:50] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you,
[2:08:53] Father. Thank you, Lord.
