[28:18] see everyone here
[28:20] hallelujah amen let's turn now if you
[28:22] got your scriptures handy we're going to
[28:26] we're gonna go to first John chapter 3
[28:30] and then we're gonna go to Luke 17 I
[28:33] mean this is the last service that Jim
[28:36] will be with us so god bless you
[28:38] where's she gone Amen god bless us been
[28:40] great having you here amen first John
[28:44] three and one first John 3:1 it says
[28:54] behold what manner of love the father
[28:57] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[29:00] called the sons of God therefore the
[29:02] world North us not because it knew him
[29:04] not beloved now we are the sons of God
[29:08] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[29:11] but we know that when he shall appear
[29:14] now let's just repeat that next but but
[29:17] we know but we know that when he shall
[29:20] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[29:25] see him as he is and he's appearing
[29:29] among us right now and every man that
[29:33] hath this hope in him purifies himself
[29:34] even as he is pure I mean let's go to
[29:38] the Gospel of Luke and chapter 17 we're
[29:46] gonna read verse 30
[29:51] they will read from verse 26 just as a
[29:54] bit of a background it says Jesus saying
[29:56] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[29:58] it be also in the days of the son of man
[30:00] they did eat they drank they married
[30:02] wives were given in marriage until the
[30:04] day that Noah entered into the ark the
[30:06] flood came and destroyed them all
[30:07] likewise also as it was in the days of
[30:09] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[30:11] they sold they planted they build it but
[30:13] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[30:15] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[30:17] and destroyed them all even those shall
[30:19] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[30:21] revealed
[30:22] amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[30:24] have your seats tonight
[30:25] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[30:28] Lord night I want to speak on how God is
[30:31] with us now we read there in first John
[30:36] 3 because you know and I wanted to read
[30:39] I wanted us to read it together because
[30:41] it says that we are the sons of God it
[30:44] does not appear yet appear what we shall
[30:46] be but we know that when he shall appear
[30:49] when he is among us I mean that we shall
[30:54] be like him for we shall see him as he
[30:56] is now brother Brahim says and convinced
[30:59] and concerned this is before the seals
[31:00] open he says now John was so sure that
[31:03] he was going to see the Messiah till he
[31:06] said he's in our midst now that's John
[31:08] the Baptist right now watch notice
[31:10] there's a big difference in the sign of
[31:12] Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming
[31:14] it's two different words means two
[31:16] different things the appearing of the
[31:17] Lord and the coming of the Lord
[31:19] now the appearing of the Lord is now
[31:22] when he's appearing in his people I want
[31:25] to emphasize the in his people he's
[31:27] appearing in his people he's appearing
[31:29] in his bride
[31:30] he's manifesting himself through his
[31:32] bride he's manifesting herself through
[31:34] his people brother Graham says in the
[31:36] sermon I've heard of thee but now I see
[31:38] thee he says when you see the
[31:39] manifestation of God you've seen God I
[31:41] mean so you should be able to look at
[31:43] one another and see Jesus Christ in
[31:44] flesh and you should be able to say I
[31:46] have seen God today because I've seen
[31:48] God and the people hallelujah when you
[31:50] see the bride manifested you've seen God
[31:52] hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that
[31:55] that you know we do not serve our idea
[31:58] it's a reality I think of the last
[32:00] Wednesday our God is a God of reality
[32:03] he's not a God of ideas or arguments or
[32:05] debate he's a God of reality and if this
[32:08] Bible is true and his promise that he
[32:10] would manifest every promise of his word
[32:12] in the stay of his people I mean that it
[32:14] will happen and I believe it is
[32:16] happening I mean I believe his life was
[32:19] now in a people I mean we're not looking
[32:20] for him to appear he's appearing he's
[32:23] appeared
[32:24] I mean he's manifesting himself and a
[32:26] people in this hour
[32:27] hallelujah and that's more than just a
[32:29] nice thing to say it's a reality it is
[32:32] happening right now
[32:34] amen his Spirit working among them
[32:37] proving that it's him with them getting
[32:39] them ready for the rapture for the
[32:41] coming of the law to catch away his
[32:43] bride the appearing and the coming all
[32:46] right now now the thing is we have to do
[32:48] if we can believe it and be concerned
[32:51] about it first we've got to be convinced
[32:53] that it is God then when we're convinced
[32:58] then we are concerned I like that he
[33:00] says all right amen so he speaks about
[33:03] the appearing and that's why we read
[33:05] that he's appearing among us though when
[33:07] we speak about the coming of the Lord
[33:08] now we understand that we are living in
[33:11] a time of the coming of the Lord so the
[33:13] Lord has come but he's also coming I
[33:15] mean when the seals are opened the
[33:17] mighty angel descent it was an open book
[33:19] that was a coming amen when when when
[33:21] Jesus came on the day of Pentecost the
[33:23] Holy Ghost came into the Upper Room that
[33:25] was a coming right but when we talk
[33:27] about the coming of the Lord we're
[33:28] talking about when he descends and we
[33:31] are our bodies are changed we got to
[33:32] meet him with the dead in Christ in the
[33:34] air that's the end of the coming right
[33:37] but he's already working among his
[33:38] children all over the world to prepare a
[33:41] people to go out and meet him hallelujah
[33:44] so now he is working among us now I read
[33:47] there Luke 17 now many times we will
[33:50] read Luke 17 in the 30th verse and we
[33:53] will think well the Son of Man being
[33:55] revealed and we will put that off in a
[33:57] prophets ministry but the Prophet tells
[33:59] us it's not just a one man ministry but
[34:01] the Son of Man is revealed in the church
[34:03] I mean the son of man is Jesus Christ so
[34:06] he's not just putting it to his own
[34:07] ministry he's saying now the Son of Man
[34:10] is revealed in a multi member boddyhm I
[34:12] mean so the Ministry of the Bride of
[34:15] Christ
[34:15] revealing or the making nine of Jesus
[34:18] Christ I mean when you should see you
[34:20] know when you should see the bride you
[34:22] should see him just like Jesus was with
[34:24] his disciples and one of them said to
[34:26] him show us the father and it also faces
[34:28] us and Jesus says have I been so long
[34:31] with you Philip and you haven't known me
[34:33] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[34:35] here's a little man he's from galleys
[34:37] and you know up in yo ye yo you know he
[34:40] said you know in his early 30s he looks
[34:42] like any other kind of man I mean but he
[34:44] was through him now the father was
[34:47] revealing himself
[34:48] it says if you've seen if you've really
[34:50] seen me not just thing not just the veil
[34:52] not just the flesh he looked like any
[34:55] other common man but the God himself the
[34:59] Messiah being revealed yeah he says if
[35:01] you've seen him you've seen the father
[35:03] right he looked like any other man you
[35:06] know it many many were stirred up in
[35:09] those days and they and they you know
[35:11] they enjoyed his ministry for a season
[35:13] but then they turned away and they said
[35:15] let's crucify him so they didn't really
[35:17] see him I mean the woman at the well and
[35:19] many others you know the Pharisee stood
[35:22] the same preaching Peter James and John
[35:23] hood amen it changed some of them amen
[35:28] in one way and it changed the others a
[35:30] different way one way it said Peter said
[35:33] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[35:34] Living God and the other said this is
[35:37] Beelzebub and then Jesus just asked the
[35:39] question if your children cast out the
[35:42] devil amen if they cast out the devil
[35:45] and then I cast out the devil it says
[35:47] basically what spirits doing it and then
[35:50] you'll be the judge because they're
[35:51] saying you because they said to him you
[35:53] cast out the devil by by the power of
[35:55] Beelzebub he says if the you're a house
[35:59] divided cannot stand this is if I cast
[36:02] out the devil by the power of the devil
[36:03] in in the devil's house is divided it
[36:05] cannot stand but if I cast by the finger
[36:07] of God now you judge it was God among
[36:10] them right and it's the same thing you
[36:13] got to look now you say well who is
[36:15] producing the life that's in the people
[36:18] amen we talked about the Bride of Christ
[36:20] what's producing the life in you amen
[36:25] I pray it's him
[36:27] I pray it's him you know you gotta take
[36:29] a real good look at it beyond a beyond a
[36:32] mental debate and say well what life is
[36:34] living what life is living
[36:37] I'm contending as Jesus Christ the Word
[36:39] made flesh amen
[36:42] know when he shall appear we shall be
[36:46] like him for we shall see him as he is
[36:50] no the bride has seen him in this hour
[36:55] the elect of every age sees the Messiah
[36:58] and and whatever form he manifests when
[37:04] he when he came down into Egypt in the
[37:06] days of Moses I'm just going to do a
[37:08] real Brooks scatter through the

[37:24] miracles those who really saw him Caleb
[37:27] and Joshua said we're more than able to
[37:29] take the land that's going to take the
[37:31] land so the same anointing that was on
[37:33] Moses now came on them Moses even said
[37:36] that these God said that these tour of a
[37:38] different spirit than the other spice
[37:39] collie because they had real faith in
[37:42] the promise God is going to give us the
[37:44] land I minced that mighty Conqueror that
[37:46] came down to deliver his people now
[37:48] anointed them

[41:43] end of the seventh seal the end of the
[41:44] trumpets that's the end of the vials
[41:46] it's the end of the ushering of the
[41:47] Millennium it's on the seventh seal is
[41:49] just like a rocket firing a rocket into
[41:51] the locker you're like Guy Fawkes you
[41:53] know uh amen and that rocket explodes up
[41:57] there and it goes up and then it
[41:58] explodes again and then and then our out
[42:01] 5 stars and where those stars explodes
[42:04] and blows under 5 more stars and
[42:06] exploits but on and on on then it fades
[42:08] out since the end of time it's the end
[42:11] of it'll be the end of sin the end of
[42:14] the devil the end of all things
[42:16] hallelujah now we are under that's
[42:20] Christ coming to the earth as part of
[42:23] that we're under that dispensation amen
[42:26] you know you you take the seven seals I
[42:29] heard at the sway no you know and I
[42:31] liked it when I heard it I said now the
[42:34] first four seals is the Antichrist
[42:36] moving I'm not in there right I'm not
[42:39] anointed by the power horse rider in
[42:41] this day they meant the fifth seal the
[42:45] fifth seals them you know the martyrdom
[42:47] of the Jews I'm not under there the
[42:50] sixth seal is a Great Tribulation that's
[42:52] not for me so I got to be somewhere I
[42:55] got to be under the seventh and that's
[42:57] Christ a mighty angel coming down
[42:58] amen to anointest people to live on as
[43:01] people now if it's the end of all things
[43:04] now then there comes a time where every
[43:07] cycle not bicycle cycle must be broken
[43:11] right so just like the woman at the well
[43:14] when she looked beyond the veil and said
[43:16] though out them we know when Messiah
[43:18] cometh he'll do these things and saw the
[43:20] Messiah then her cycle of her life
[43:22] changed it was broken her old life was
[43:26] broken right she never had the man
[43:28] problem again she was looking for love
[43:30] in all the wrong places I mean she was
[43:33] broken she you know hurt people hurt
[43:35] people end up hurting themselves more as
[43:37] well and she was looking for love and so
[43:39] she got married a few times this it was
[43:41] no point getting married him I'll just
[43:42] live with this one and that's was the
[43:44] current state right but then now her
[43:48] Messiah came her real husband came and
[43:52] spoke some words to her they just had a
[43:54] brief conversation that's all it takes
[43:56] Jesus speak a few words speak a few
[43:58] words to you you got to be looking for
[44:00] him to speak hallelujah and it changed
[44:03] her life brother Ram says of that light
[44:05] struck that seed a man she was redeemed
[44:08] because she received that word and
[44:10] believed that there was the Messiah and
[44:12] a whole life change I mean she was an
[44:14] outcast in her village that's why she
[44:16] went to the well of that particular time
[44:18] not with the other young ladies and the
[44:20] same ones that thrust her out of her
[44:22] society she went running back in to come
[44:25] see a man that's told me everything I've
[44:27] done is not the very Messiah hallelujah
[44:31] broke that complex amen our God is a
[44:34] cycle breaker hallelujah he's a complex
[44:38] breaker amen he'll heal your pain he'll
[44:41] heal up your wounds the anointing Jesus
[44:44] when he went to the synagogue it's
[44:46] amazing how people get angry when when
[44:49] when we read about the scripture being
[44:51] fulfilled he takes thee he takes you
[44:55] know he goes into the synagogue of
[44:56] Nazareth finds the place to read of
[44:59] Isaiah says the spread of laws upon me
[45:02] because he has anointed me to preach the
[45:05] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[45:07] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[45:08] deliverance to the captives and
[45:10] recovering the sites of the blind to set
[45:12] at liberty them that are bruised to
[45:14] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[45:16] and he stopped right there in the middle
[45:18] of that scripture left the other partner
[45:20] and the
[45:20] a vengeance of our God for a second
[45:22] coming I mean because that part was
[45:24] fulfilled the first coming the others
[45:25] the second coming hallelujah he split a
[45:28] scripture and two and said this day he
[45:31] closed the book and gave it again to the
[45:33] minister and said this day this
[45:35] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[45:37] hallelujah so what was laying there on
[45:39] paper now was living now become
[45:42] manifested it was a prophecy no about no
[45:45] doubt it brought me debate on ideas and
[45:47] blogs and websites about it but then
[45:49] finally a man stood up and read it I
[45:51] mean he found his place in the scripture
[45:53] saying this is me this date of the
[45:54] Scriptures fulfilled a mere - no doubt
[45:57] the woman of the well if she was sitting
[45:58] there after the well experience she

[46:29] own ministry in the scripture that is
[46:31] sin for us they didn't rejoice they got
[46:33] mad they got mad interesting isn't it

[55:10] stomach for dessert I love dessert if I
[55:12] see someone like that and then when
[55:13] they're done
[55:14] I got a digest but they've had a good
[55:18] time and the pressure is put on the
[55:21] banquet is happy to see someone like
[55:23] that they have enjoyed the fullness of
[55:26] my banquet hallelujah amen and they'll
[55:29] tell them they'll so good I enjoyed the
[55:31] food so wonderful is my favorite how did
[55:34] you know I like those kind of things
[55:35] it's so wonderful that's the person you
[55:37] really want to invite to a banquet now
[55:40] how much more us how much more us you
[55:43] know what we have you know what this
[55:45] message is it's God revealed Jesus
[55:48] Christ revealed amen brother Bram says
[55:51] this now I'm gonna read this from the
[55:53] rapture message I just want you to think
[55:54] about this now the the rapture in 1st
[55:58] Thessalonians 4 the Lord descends with a
[56:01] shout the voice of the Archangel and the
[56:03] Trump of God right he does these three
[56:06] things as he is descending now he sees
[56:10] this in the rapture message for the Lord
[56:11] Himself the sixteenth bertha's from
[56:14] first Thessalonians shall descend from
[56:15] him
[56:15] with a shout with the voice of the
[56:17] Archangel in the Trump of God three
[56:19] things happen a voice a shout a voice a
[56:22] trumpet as there before Jesus appears
[56:24] now a shout Jesus does all them when
[56:27] he's descending the shout what is the
[56:29] shout it's the message going forth first
[56:33] the Living bread of life bringing forth
[56:36] the bride now God has a way of doing
[56:39] things he never changes his policy he
[56:42] never changes
[56:43] he's the unchanging God and Amos 3:7 he
[56:46] said he'd do nothing on earth until he
[56:48] first reveals it to servants the
[56:50] prophets just as certain as he promised
[56:52] it he'll do it and we have a principle
[56:54] in Romans 10 faith cometh by hearing and
[56:57] hearing the Word of God but how can you
[56:59] hear only someone has sent and how come
[57:01] in your and you can only hear them if
[57:03] they've been commissioned and sent and
[57:05] then you hear the word of God this is
[57:06] whom sort of called on the name of the
[57:08] Lord shall be saved so in the servant is
[57:11] sent and he's anointed a commission he
[57:13] preaches the gospel and the people hear
[57:15] that word they can call upon the name of
[57:17] the Lord and be saved right so faith
[57:20] cometh by hearing and hearing the Word
[57:22] of God hallelujah that's why there has
[57:25] to be a messenger come at the end of the
[57:27] age winds up all the loose ends reveals
[57:30] Christ to the people and that word
[57:32] produces a braid amen Joshua was told
[57:38] meditate on the whole Word of God you'll
[57:39] be successful
[57:40] so that word that he was feeding on gave
[57:43] him success gave him the inheritance for
[57:46] the people hallelujah how much more us
[57:50] don't you want your inheritance across
[57:53] Jordan and in sand and make a beach
[57:56] house on the other side I don't know how
[57:58] big the river is but you know what I
[57:59] mean
[58:00] I made a boat house you just in the
[58:02] Jordan what's it's nice it's River and
[58:06] go fishing yeah but what about that
[58:09] mountain there don't you want your
[58:11] mountain what tribe you from I just want
[58:13] the boathouse what's wrong with you
[58:15] that's how some people are they live
[58:18] below they're privileged I'm just going
[58:20] to stay in death stay in the Jordan you
[58:22] had across Jordan the word has come the
[58:25] Ark has come as part of death that you
[58:27] can walk through
[58:29] I mean that's why we have real births in
[58:31] this place wherever the messages is real
[58:33] births because a way through a death the
[58:35] self has been opened by the word and you
[58:37] can cross through how lujah well I'm on
[58:41] the other side you're gonna take Jericho
[58:43] but I've got the beach house real
[58:46] estates expensive on the water I'm
[58:48] thinking of my future children no go
[58:51] take your land go take your land I don't
[58:55] want to just ought to be in wherever I'm
[58:56] called to be I want to possess that land
[58:59] amen now they seize now and I won this
[59:05] up but when we shall see him we shall be
[59:11] weightless
[59:12] I just let's just read that again first
[59:15] John three you know what I mean about
[59:18] the feast on we've got you say no one
[59:23] can be drunk on the spirit every day hey
[59:25] sure have you seen anyone who's ever
[59:27] left oh I've never seen it done before
[59:31] no I had never seen it rain before
[59:33] either but he knew it was gonna rain
[59:35] amen
[59:36] Joshua had never seen people might
[59:38] surround a fortified city and watch it
[59:40] fall down flat but it did Joshua had
[59:44] never seen the Sun and the moon stand
[59:45] still it did he's under inspiration a
[59:48] dead amen had they ever seen the Red Sea
[59:51] part before they parted the Red Sea no
[59:54] but it did Shamgar had an ox code he
[59:58] didn't go on Wikipedia can a man farmer
[1:00:02] with an ox go defeat six hundred I'm
[1:00:03] Philistines wait honey did you pray the
[1:00:06] board broadband this is going slow oh he
[1:00:11] didn't do that did he he knew he is a
[1:00:13] circumcised Israelite he was living into
[1:00:16] his inheritance
[1:00:18] he didn't say can't it be done something
[1:00:20] moved in him it is gonna be done and he
[1:00:22] took the off scot and killed every one
[1:00:24] of them hallelujah all things are
[1:00:27] possible to them that believe he ever
[1:00:28] thought about that all all things are
[1:00:31] possible to him to believe three of
[1:00:33] believers three have believers I mean
[1:00:36] brother arm says even the weakest of
[1:00:38] Christians when they get that on their
[1:00:40] knees
[1:00:41] the kingdom of Hell shakes hallelujah I
[1:00:43] think we should spend more time on our
[1:00:45] knees why are you praying I hear an
[1:00:48] earthquake hallelujah and yet the devil
[1:00:51] never built his buildings properly
[1:00:54] I've been glory to God now sorry first
[1:00:58] John three it says now at verse 2 think
[1:01:02] about it I'm not I'm not telling jokes
[1:01:05] you got to think about all things are
[1:01:06] possible all things we don't live in the
[1:01:10] Lutheran age all they could live as high
[1:01:11] as the just shall live by faith that's
[1:01:13] what God poured out and then the
[1:01:15] Westlands it was the just shall live by
[1:01:17] faith and then sanctification okay they
[1:01:20] couldn't go any higher than that that's
[1:01:22] what got it restored and they're
[1:01:23] Pentecostals the restoration of the
[1:01:25] gifts right and that's as far as they
[1:01:27] could go but then when the Son of Man is
[1:01:29] revealed Jesus Christ the fullness all
[1:01:32] that God poured into Christ he poured
[1:01:34] into where the church you hallelujah so
[1:01:38] we're not called the plateau oh I've
[1:01:41] never had a time like that time what
[1:01:43] about now
[1:01:44] oh I remember being full of joy what
[1:01:46] about now all that piece of puzzle
[1:01:49] understanding back there what about now
[1:01:51] hallelujah what about oh I surround and
[1:01:54] felt so free we should be free Oh
[1:01:56] hallelujah now but we know that when he
[1:02:02] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[1:02:06] shall see him as he is now we shall be
[1:02:10] like him now
[1:02:12] whoa what's he like he's the mighty God
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] he conquered hell death in the grave he
[1:02:21] will stood the devil's temptations he
[1:02:22] overcame a meant popularity didn't get
[1:02:26] him money didn't get him woman didn't
[1:02:29] get him the devil's lies didn't get him
[1:02:31] and he was tempted at all points
[1:02:33] but you without sin and he was a man of
[1:02:35] flesh and blood he was tempted on all
[1:02:37] points or Jesus doesn't understand what
[1:02:39] I'm going through
[1:02:40] yeah he does he was tempted it's just
[1:02:43] been rebranded because the devil try yo
[1:02:45] he's got to keep marketing same old

[1:03:05] recently you know still still the same
[1:03:08] company we've been the same company for
[1:03:09] 25 years and then before that when it
[1:03:12] was all one big scientific group with me
[1:03:14] were in different ones but we now we've
[1:03:17] been the same company for 25 years we do
[1:03:19] the same kind of things technology may
[1:03:22] have improve but we do the same kind of
[1:03:24] things the devil has the same old things
[1:03:26] maybe the technology will be improved
[1:03:29] your the methods but when you boil it
[1:03:31] down it's the same old thing I mean same
[1:03:34] old yo whatever devil it is same old
[1:03:37] devil just rebranded new and shiny
[1:03:41] latest model same old devil right so he

[1:04:43] waited to actually show you I am the
[1:04:45] resurrection and the life

[1:05:28] pull the power off it oh the lights on
[1:05:31] me brother Bram says you just see the
[1:05:34] look on people's faces when the devil's
[1:05:35] about to get exposed in their life amen
[1:05:38] and why do people people get angry and
[1:05:41] their tempers fly cuz that's the devil
[1:05:44] knows he's exposed but people's pride
[1:05:46] holds on to Satan amen
[1:05:51] he conquered everything amen now if he
[1:05:57] is if that is how he is he was the Word
[1:05:59] made flesh right he did all that to
[1:06:03] please the father I do only that to
[1:06:05] please the father he knew why he was
[1:06:07] here on earth this is who he was he was
[1:06:10] God the heart of God expressed like
[1:06:14] brother Bram said he said I used to
[1:06:16] think that the father hated me but Jesus
[1:06:18] the son loved me I come to find out they
[1:06:20] one and the same in Jesus the heart of
[1:06:21] God right and so he's the heart of God
[1:06:26] expressed now if that is him then if we
[1:06:30] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:06:33] him for we shall see him as he is so if
[1:06:38] that's the case and I believe he is
[1:06:40] appearing among us I believe this is
[1:06:42] more than enthusiasm it's been six odd
[1:06:45] years it hasn't burned out for me

[1:09:36] Ark come back into his City he had been
[1:09:40] fighting for years and he was on the run
[1:09:48] and he fought many perils and dangers
[1:09:51] finally he came down I have my capital
[1:09:56] and the priests of bringing the Ark is
[1:09:58] fitting and he begun to done so I don't
[1:10:00] know how it here comes a presence of God
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:29] you know what this is the first five
[1:10:33] books I'll just show you something just
[1:10:37] think about this
[1:10:38] Deuteronomy now of course it wasn't in
[1:10:41] this form because that was on rolls
[1:10:43] whatever more but that doesn't matter he
[1:11:06] stopped the Sun stands to walk those
[1:11:13] Kings you know in the cave and they
[1:11:15] dragged them out after the battle he
[1:11:17] told us captain's the younger generation
[1:11:24] all with just fire book - the Bible
[1:11:27] under the blood of bulls and goats that
[1:11:30] word became a living reality in his life
[1:11:32] and he took everything how much more we
[1:11:38] don't just have five books you take this
[1:11:51] now all tests with blood of bulls and
[1:11:53] goats people are moved by the Spirit of
[1:12:00] God they did it they did exploits in
[1:12:04] their name I think God now releases more
[1:12:07] word
[1:12:10] and then the wood Himself becomes flesh
[1:12:12] yeah the blood of bulls of guts now God
[1:12:16] comes and dwells into people oh this is
[1:12:18] a nine thumpeka
[1:12:19] because enthroned said they've released
[1:12:20] his full power more power and John's
[1:12:23] only all of Patmos he sing the whole
[1:12:26] plan of redemption he's seen the book of
[1:12:28] Revelation he sees the mighty angel
[1:12:30] voice of seven thunders uttered their
[1:12:32] voices
[1:12:33] he's about to write it down to release
[1:12:34] that word to the church to seal it up
[1:12:36] John
[1:12:37] it'll be released the time of the end
[1:12:46] and then and then here we go I'll choose
[1:12:50] a prophet to the land I mean and those
[1:12:53] seven thunders are no longer a mystery
[1:12:55] they've been revealed and it's all the
[1:12:57] Bible's not adding to the Bible at all
[1:12:58] in the scripture and a releases of power
[1:13:17] was called the walk on the water what do
[1:13:21] you think what do you think Jesus wanted
[1:13:22] him to do just to say I walked on water
[1:13:24] he wanted to know now the first Adam
[1:13:26] controlled nature right the second Adam
[1:13:30] is now controlling nature he's walking
[1:13:33] on water
[1:13:45] now let's see the wind was blowing
[1:13:48] it wasn't cow they meant trials in the
[1:13:51] midst of the trial I'll put it that way
[1:13:52] and Peter is walking on top of the trial
[1:13:56] see sometimes the trial goes away or the
[1:13:58] devil goes away sometimes you're still
[1:14:00] fighting him but you go to the victory I
[1:14:04] mean he doesn't just give us this you
[1:14:06] know flowery beard of ease it's a rugged
[1:14:09] walk God wants it to be a record walk
[1:14:12] but he wants to reveal himself on you we
[1:14:15] would never have had the Book of Psalms
[1:14:16] if David just went straight from the
[1:14:19] anointing by Samuel to the throne he had
[1:14:24] to be on the run from Saul he had to
[1:14:26] take Bathsheba all those things had to
[1:14:28] happen for him to write we would never
[1:14:31] had the psalm created me a clean heart O
[1:14:33] God and renew a right spirit within me
[1:14:37] we would never had that that's a son
[1:14:40] that's after he's been Nathan's coming
[1:14:43] the prophet two years after he took
[1:14:45] Bathsheba killed us killed her husband
[1:14:47] tells the parable of the man with many
[1:14:49] sheep and there's the poor man with one
[1:14:51] sheep angry anger is he hears it and
[1:15:00] then the King says that man must die and
[1:15:03] then the Prophet just points them in the
[1:15:04] poison spring otherwise you're that man
[1:15:06] two years later after it was done since
[1:15:10] still sits around yes amen and if your
[1:15:13] gods
[1:15:13] God will come and put his finger on it
[1:15:16] hallelujah
[1:15:17] but if it does it's a glorious thing
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:22] we would never had the Book of Psalms
[1:15:23] without those trials and hardship
[1:15:26] hallelujah and God wants this word to be
[1:15:29] manifested in your life and he will
[1:15:31] course allow trials to come and hardship
[1:15:34] amen in your everyday life hallelujah
[1:15:38] because he wants to express himself out
[1:15:40] of you using that trial I'm so glad
