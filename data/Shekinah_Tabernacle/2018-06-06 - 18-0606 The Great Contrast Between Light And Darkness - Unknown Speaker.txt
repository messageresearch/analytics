your grace and mercy to us and for your shed blood Lord in Jesus name god bless you you can take your seats this evening we've got a special something special we've got a testimony from sister Robyn so we have that and in brother Ben we'll come up after that last week I came to Bible study at pokeo Bay and before I got there I had been to the specialist for my ankle and God had given me an earlier appointment and you know it was just a continuing saga and I was just I was sort of saying Ronnie Oh Lord I've done this and I've done that and I've done this and I've done that but Roubaix I knew I had to go and mum was going oh your foot is so saw you should stay at home you know and I'm thinking yeah I should really stay at home because it's starting to really hurt and then I thought known and I'm going to go and pick up sister Maggie and we're going to go to pick her obey and we had a time of fellowship going up to cook your real base sister a Maggie and I we just clicked like the sonnets it's really good it's wonderful to have a sister in the Lord and and then we got to put your real bait and I've by the time we got there I my my ball would make my ball my my ankle my whole foot was just like a ball of fire and the specialist had said to me when I give you this steroid injection and your ankle well he said to me this afterwards um alright you could feel discomfort for two weeks well I tell you what I could have chopped off my foot Anthony because it was just so so I could barely get up the driveway my tears running down my face and I got inside and I just sat down and I couldn't even sit with the weight of my league on my ankle it was just so so saw so I sat on the floor and I just said Lord you know what I can't do anything I can't do this you know this pain I can't do I can't accept it I'm not accepting it and I just surrendered everything to him you know it's just like I know that the Lord is my Savior I know that I can do absolutely nothing without him but you know when we were praying I just knew that it was just him just him anyway all of a sudden it was just like there was absolutely no pain in my ankle and I tell you I've been running up and down Bronwen stair so spiral stairs in the house I've been dancing I've been doing all sorts of silly things that I wouldn't normally have stepped forth and done because I've all you know I can't do this but I can do it through Christ I can do it and it's you know I can't wait for the perfect new body because this ankle is you know a pretty good indication of how it's going to be [Applause] praise the Lord I mean let's just stand shall we and um it's just seeing the course of I'm amazed just just a couple of times I mean it's good to see one out tonight I mean I'm amazed that you love me I'm amazed how you care through your precious blood I found pardon and my sins are washed [Music] my sister Wayne I think I believe yes I believe that you love me [Music] how you care your precious blood I found and my sins they're all washed all my sin are [Music] amen hallelujah I mean thinking musicians I mean praise the Lord they're all washed away I mean well god bless you all it's great to be home brother Albert has written his testimony at his testimony there's some on the front there then there's some on the shelf I'm halfway through and it's real good you'll be blessed he called it from vanity to sanity hallelujah amen but yeah you'll you'll be blessed if you if you read that amen let's turn to the Book of Luke if you at your Bibles handy yes I listen to brother Isaac service and I you know I enjoyed it I mean it's very interesting to see where a country comes from because how something starts is normally how it continues so you know you get to understand a people's makeup and character a nature in this day if you can trace back and see where they came from I mean so um yes it was good but so I'm going to take a scripture from that just tying it into our thought of where we are and in the in the latest in church age we're gonna go to Luke chapter 2 this is samuel marsden 'he's opening scripture well first text for the first service that was preached on these shores so this is i look to and verses 9 and 10 and then we're gonna go to Revelation chapter 8 it says in lo the angel is read from verse 8 rather and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people I mean I'm glad we can still read those same words hallelujah and let's go to revelations 10 we're gonna read verses 8 to 11 we still have glad tidings of great joy like houses great joy not just joy but great joy amen revelations 8:2 11 it says here in the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take take it up and eat it take it and eat it up and it shall be in my belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings I mean let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer if you'd like to be remembered of prayer just want to raise your hand to the Lord just make your requests known and it's just pray gracious father we want to thank you very much that we still have tidings of great joy thank you Lord that Lord that we are not living in darkness but Lord you've come upon us and your glory has shone around us father thank you Lord that we're not just caught up in the busyness of life but you've come into this Lord into the season to gather your children to make yourself knowing that we would further know where we are our Lord in your Scripture and we want to thank you we can come together on this night Lord just open the pages of your word and to father and to read it Lord and to to hear your word and I just pray that you would anoint your word please one more time Lord that takes your spirit Lord it's not by power by might by by by your spirit father you have said Lord Jesus so father may you come and anoint each heart here anoint your word Lord and we want to just Lord you see the hands that have been raised Lord I pray you would meet the need the Lord that's behind every hand father also want to remember no Elias mum and prayer father she's going to Lord the doctor on Wednesday in Argentina so that we'll probably I don't know how many hours are behind us but Lord tomorrow her time she will be going to the doctor Lord to see if she's able to fly here in July Lord or when she's coming so father I praise you'd give her a perfect bill of health father may she be able to get on the plane Lord may she come here Lord because father nobody know whether they're gracious Lord they they desire Lord above all else that no Elias mum would come to this land and become a new creature in you Lord sir may you grant it father Lord may she be able to travel here Lord father may you grant it dear God I pray you'd undertake for her a little want to pray for Lundy's visa as well thank you the passports come through now Lord I pray the visa would come through Lord may she be able to get on to her flight Lord I think it's on Thursday Lord may you grant it father I pray that there be so Lord for your glory and Lord we just ask you would always be at those who couldn't make it tonight Lord those who are streaming or father be be with them always pray you'd be very present Lord among us may you take the service under your control for your glory please in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen I mean God bless you all you may you may have your seats tonight I mean it's wonderful to have Stephanie with us god bless you I mean she can sing hopefully we'll hear you on Sunday no pressure amen you know hide it under a bushel no I'm gonna let it shine maybe if I get a tambourine thrown in my hand hey someone getting sick Eddie who I mean it's good to be home Rev lay so we read here in Revelations 10 we we see if we you know if you've we we have been going through this chapter and we we understand that that John is a you know the book of Revelation it's a book of symbols every one in the book or everything in the book of symbolic is symbolic of something and John himself as a as a symbol in the book just like we you know you read revelations for one after the church ages John CEOs the door I put in heaven and it's called come up hither and so it shows that at the end of the church ages as a rapture of the church where John represents a whole body of the redeemed that they go to meet the Lord in the air and so revelations 10 here when John is told to to take this book and to eat this book this represents an endtime people that become one with the Lord Jesus Christ and they are sent into all the world to preach the gospel that has been restored jesus said that this gospel must be preached to all nations then the end shall come but it's not a denominator still gospel but it's the the the original gospel that we have been restored to it must be you know the gospel is more than just preaching or teaching but it's the demonstration of the Holy Ghost power and power and signs and wonders God went with his apostles confirming his word it was more than them teaching the people that was God coming and behind that word and supernaturally vindicating this is me I mean I think we should just pray for brother Andy just now I just forgot with him so let's pray for him because he's on a supernatural mission I mean siliceous you don't mind breaking the order of service up a little bit I have a list bow our heads and pray let's all pray together for brother Andy gracious father Lord we pray for brother Andy and brother Adrian and Vietnam Lord Jesus we want to lift them into your presence by prayer we thank you Lord for the reports that are coming through father I just pray you're just group each soul Lord Lord that would come under the anointing Lord Jesus that hears the word that comes to the meeting group each soul Lord and birthed them into the kingdom father I pray Lord that each one of those souls is like your prophecy the Apostle Paul will go to one place and and get one convert it come back a year later and there's thirty from that one so lord I pray each soul that comes in Lord in these meetings Lord Lord may may 30 come from that one Lord may there be a mighty harvest in that part of the earth Lord may you be the apportion keep them safe Lord and may you just use them for your glory Lord may signs follow Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name for your glory supernaturally vindicate your word to each one there please may you grind up father we commit them into your hands in Jesus Christ name Amen I mean so it's a supernatural you know this gospel is a supernatural gospel it's more than just speaking things more than singing but God should come down and and vindicate it in your life right and so now the Apostle John we we know from history that that hears on the Isle of Patmos God revealed the book of Revelation God gave him the revelation but then after that he went back to Ephesus and he pastored the the church at Ephesus till he passed away he did not literally go through the world Emperor and preached before prophesy before many peoples nations tongues and kings right so John is a symbol in the book right and he's a symbol of you he's the he's a symbol of the end time bride so when so when we go you know we you know just like they've gone to Vietnam they're they're fulfilling the scripture where they've received tidings of great joy I mean we've received an open book everything that Adam and Eve lost has been restored I mean Dominion has been restored to Adams fallen race and Adams race is no longer fallen but we are redeemed I mean such tidings of redemption that's great joy we're no longer under this your slavery of the devil that's great joy we're a free people that's great joy there's Liberty among the redeemed I mean that's great joy I mean we're peace of fathers all understanding that's great joy I mean we have the good news it's not bad news or just mediocre okay news it's good news I mean that we can live above sin we can walk from this world to the next world I mean we can receive a full adoption to what the change of this body that's good news hallelujah I mean the win-win-win the devil and his angels are no more we shall still be amen that's real good news I mean I mean we've got a new heaven new earth to go to that's good news we shouldn't let these things become common to us I mean because you look at what are you aiming for in life i Manning for a rapture I meant raise up a child in the way they shall go when they're old they shall not depart what were you raising your children you should be raising them there's a body change for you there's an adoption for you I mean there's are there's a new heavens in you or fear you should fire them that way not just be good people and whatever more that's all part of it but what's the main goal I mean we should be having eternal goal right so if tidings of great joy now it's strange that in the state that we live in there are great tidings of joy gods among us God's and his people once again I mean he comes and dwells in human flesh once again it's incredible you think the creator of heavens and earth comes and dwells in people Amen you should see it believe you say I see God with skin on right I hope that's not too strong but but that's true I mean when you saw the Apostles after the upper room you say I see God with skin on right hallelujah and then that life just keeps spreading through from generation to generation when you saw Timothy you say I should you should well see I saw God with skin on right and it should be the same thing amen when you look at yourself in the mirror you should be able to go back into your testimony and say God one day you put skin on me or rather you'd well that mean I've got skin on and me amen hallelujah because God comes and dwells in his church and it's God being the Christian in us so it's an incredible time of of of great joy and it's also an incredible time of light I mean let's go to Matthew chapter four I'm gonna I'm going to kind of contrast two things darkness and light because it's a time of great light it's also a time of great darkness but we shouldn't despair at the darkness that it has to be there so here we are in Matthew chapter four and we'll go from verse 12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving nazareth he came to dwell thing and came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and the borders of Zebulun epsilen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying the land of Zebulun and the land of Netherland by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which said in the region and shadow of death light has sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand so he it was here was God you know Jesus Christ now he goes to these places because they had to be fulfilled that light would spring up upon these people they were sitting in darkness here they who you know you're they were there they had their families they had their religion they had their occupations they had what you know everything of life but they're sitting in darkness but then light had come to them and we understand from the scripture that Jesus himself says in the book of John that job John the Baptist he was a bright and shining light and you're willing for a season to walk in his life and we know that John was the fulfillment of Scripture he was the voice that you know was crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord he was fulfilling Scripture and so when God fulfills Scripture it is light right it is light for the people to walk in a mint so if you take the opposite of it it's darkness I mean so to to accept what God is doing in your day and is light it helps you see it helps you walk you know we have to go you know where you are all right so now it is a time just like in the first coming of Jesus Christ it was a time of great light more than a prophet was there God Himself was there and it was a time of great light now when light comes it actually causes the darkness to come together just before dawn there's always it's always the darkest just before dawn because the light is about to come over the horizon and as it comes over the horizon it pushes the darkness together in a way so it's always darkest just before dawn so now here was here was the Lord coming these people were sitting in darkness but then now light sprang upon them where they could actually see those are who were deign to see could see they said this is more than a man from Galilee or Nazareth this is God this is the Messiah just like the woman of the well she had her life she had her problem she had her ideas of things we know we Messiah cometh he'll do these things and we should worship here and worship here and whatever more but hey you're the Messiah was standing speaking to her and then she you know he says to her go get your husband I have done that's right you've had five the one you with us not yours and she says we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and she just he just says to her he that speaks to the as he so what happened light came into Samaria her life was different because the light got turned on hallelujah and she didn't go back to darkness her whole life was changed because of that one moment a man brother don't see the light struck the cedar came to life Oh wasn't that a wonderful moment I'm speaking about you don't just talk about her that's Gloria now talk about you you should be able to see yourself in the scripture wasn't that a wonderful moment it was a wonderful moment I was there my headphones at University in my room with headphones on scared my flatmates who had no kind of faith who come and bust me listening to these servants and office could God God spoke to me I had to surrender everything but God spoke to me I had to be an Anglican Church Presbyterian Church a boarding school three times a week all this stuff then speak to me one but I heard a voice good morning friends I'm gonna speak about Redemption and completeness and enjoy the seal of God why so many failed to keep the victory all that really spoke to me hallelujah so now there's also our time so but we understand you're from the first coming of Jesus now the light has to react to the darkness what's it going to do and we know ultimately the darkness rejects the light and they crucified him that was in the first coming now let's go to numbers chapter 20 because here we have an account I thought we'd read it instead of me just just according it but Moses Moses is called to bring forth water numbers 20 verse 7 this is in the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod gather the other sembly together down Aaron though brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall go give forth as water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shall give the congregation and their Beast drink and Moses took took the took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses now and gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with this rod he smoked the rock twice and the rock sorry and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because he believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I've given them so they he was said speak to the rock it will bring forth water but in his anger he took us right and he smote it twice and brother Brahim says the whole plan was broken right there but he had to but the rock is Christ he says I am the bread of life which came down from heaven I mean he was that rock in the wilderness he was the breath as the brass ever was lifted up soul being lifted up he was that in time he was all those things in type so but he had to be smitten twice because he's actually been crucified twice right so he was smitten there on Calvary that was his first crucifixion but then there is a second crucifixion in this day that's what I'm talking about yeah there was a great contrast today there's great light and there's great darkness so there's tidings of great joy but also there's darkness you know in this time so he was he was smitten once on Calvary but he had to be smitten twice now and so in order to qui se we can't crucify how can you crucify Jesus in this hour you kill US influence among the people right that's how you crucify someone again you make them a no effect because you can't kill a spirit a spirit can't die right it's eternal died and his body Amen is up in heaven she can't physically crucify him beacon but you can't crucify his effect among the people right Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees by teaching the commandments and traditions of men you make the Word of God Norfolk to the people so that's how crews a fight you just teach the commandments and doctrines of men above the Word of God and you make the Word of God no effect so for example the effect of the law should have been you possessed the fullness of the land one will chase a thousand to chase 10,000 that was meant to be if they were living according to God's Word in the land that should have been happening right but there they were they had forgotten you know they didn't even have a testimony like Gideon if God is with us were the miracles and that trying to politically hold together their country and you know the scribes the Pharisees having meetings what shall we do they're worried that the Romans would come and take their nation away in a little political minded there is no power of God among them well will it happen because the Word of God was now affected them anymore the same the same word that Moses received I mean was the same word they had if they stripped away all the tradition it was still there in his purity right but because they added the commandments doctors made to make the Word of God no effect and so here was the one who gave the law he was standing now in flesh you read Matthew chapter 5 he says you've heard of all time thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto thee he that looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery in his heart already and he said thou shalt not murder but I say unto you he that looks angrily at his brother that of causes committed murder already he was the lawgiver he magnified the law he magnified it amen and the reason he magnified it because he was a greater grace on the scene his fullness of grace and truth right he magnified the law he was the one that spoke to Moses he said to them before Abraham was I am and they wanted to kill him when he really reveals who he is and so they took him and there they crucified him okay and and the same thing is repeated in this day now he is been rejected for Creed's and dogmas we read an au in it yeah and the latest in church age says Jesus says behold I stand in the door and knock revelations 3 and 20 if any man hear my voice and open the door I'll gone to him and sup with him and he with me so where is he he's on the outside of the church world trying to get back in it's not one of the saddest scriptures in the entire Bible he's not even in where he should be worshiped he's been kicked out the outside because they've taken creeds and dogmas in tradition and they've taken that and they've kicked out the pure Word of God what's happened he's been crucified he's been thrown on the outside of the church say well that's awful bad it has to be this way no brother branch says in the indictment he preaches the indictment I and I'd this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ if you wanna hear something sobering you should go listen to that one he says it could not have been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not have been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it can be done today because time has run out so he sees it couldn't be when when he preached in 1963 he said it couldn't mean done 10 years ago why cuz the fullness of all that God was was now upon the earth right and the son of man ministry there it was and said now now he says now they can crucify him and he says I cry indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ now this has to happen because history has to repeat itself history has to repeat so what happened in the first coming has to repeat in the second coming so in the first coming there was a there was a messenger that introduced that that called the people out a denomination out of their out of their systems turn their hearts to receive the Messiah that's what John the Baptist hid that's what his job was to introduce Jesus to the people he says behold the lamb of God take away the sin of the world he introduced them right he introduced them and then after that John said I must decrease he must increase John went off the scene and now the people walking with the Lord they meant and there's the same thing with a brother Brando here's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world showing Jesus Christ in the scripture of the mystery of God is finished in this hour we know who he is we know what he likes we know what it doesn't like we know the correct approach to him we know how to serve him right we're not guessing he pointed out the Lamb of God in Scripture taking away all the Creed's they meant and now but that same God that was that was introduced through the Prophet is still here they meant that same Pirlo far as a mango hallelujah that same God is still here the Holy Ghost we feel among us is the same God that was back there I mean he hasn't left us we're not just fighting it out ourselves but God Himself is leading us into a rapture giving us rapturing faith in his word a man that's what we have we're not waiting for something else to come it's already here I mean the revivals already here the quick sure will work upon the earth is already here amen he's up enough all of heaven is upon the earth all that Jesus is is here amen I happen to believe that I mean there's not an eighth messenger to come right it's not in Scripture there's two that are going to Israel but I'm not part of the Jewish nation I'm a Gentile so then I'm not called I'm not awakened under the administer I'm awakened under Malachi 4 to the Gentiles and I've been awakened hallelujah why cuz light sprung up a mouse like the Shepherd's just they're out sitting in darkness doing my own little thing suddenly an angel came hallelujah the glory love came around me what is this what's going on I'll give you tidings of great joy fear not you know you know how they look you know when it goes beyond here it goes into here first thing it's such a burden for said a man I think God buddy says don't fear I've made away I mean you can get rid of that sin burden I mean I sit a little Calvary you just got to accept that hallelujah baby no how can I overcome don't worry I've overcome for you I'll come and live in your manifest that victory I mean I was driving home today my prayer my prayer for this year maybe every year a Lord honestly the full manifestation of your victory that you want at Calvary I want to see the full manifestation of it I don't wanted to see a healing here and a healing there that's glorious or a bit of deliverance honestly a body change that's the full victory I mean that a people would be taken from this world be washed and sanctified and transform and God would take them from this world to the next world that's what I want to see that's why he died for me hallelujah this way he died for me there's my prayer in Lord I want to see this I'm gonna see it this full victory I don't want a partial victory I mean I want to roll the beat down I want to go home that's why he died he didn't die you know he doesn't want to see half a victory that's what that's not why he died he want to see a full he wants a people completely redeemed on streets of gold dancing hallelujah amen oh yeah hey brother Jeremy on Sunday saying I feel like dancing I didn't see the video I hope you were I mean let's not get too starchy feel like dancing dancing feel our rejoicing rejoice I mean if they do it at the rugby we can do it here can we do it hallelujah and we have eternal life this is glorious jesus paid it all but it's all done what he made had told that all that's wonderful hallelujah amen so now he's on the outside he's been crucified again but this has to be so and it's not actually the darkness sometimes we may be this is me but sometimes we think now the darkness is doing this the darkness is making this world so bad or whatever you want to call and ensure but it's the light is ultimately in control just like when Dawn is coming it's not the darkness making yourself darker it's because light is shining right light is shining that's why it becomes dark is not because the darkness decides I'm going to be darker now there's a greater force that's making it come together now let's go to let's go to the Book of Luke and we're going to go to Luke 23 now before we read there I'm sure we can all agree there's a great uniting going on in the world there's a great uniting politics is coming together you see all the you see all the countries coming together you see religion coming together not just within Christendom but other religion and interfaith day a dialog has never been so great then it is in this hour where the we can see a rabbi in or you're a Catholic priest Orthodox Buddhist whatever it may be they all come together say we are one because what's happening things are being pushed together and and groups that were never friends maybe Buddha enemies a few years ago now they've become friends why is this because light shining right I'm going to show you this to you in the scripture here and Luke chapter 23 because it you know as I as I mentioned before that history is repeating itself history is repeating it's what you see in the first crucifixion you see again today Luke 23 verses 6 to 12 the Empire lit so this is during Jesus's crucifixion this is when he's on trial when Pilate heard of Galilee because he just found out that Jesus was from Galilee he asked whether the man were Galilean and as soon as he knew that he belonged under his jurisdiction he sent him to hear it who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time and when here at saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desires to see him for a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him then he questioned with him and many woods but he answered him nothing and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him and hear it with his men of war set him at naught and mocked to me and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate and the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together for before there are M natee between themselves so them crucifying Jesus made them friends these ones who are who ever teased us they had nothing to do with each other but by crucifying in the midst of the crucifixion of the of the rejection of the of the Living Word and that day made them come together as friends they were friends after this right and you go back in time and you see the World Council of Churches come up around the same time as Rho becomes a nation brother Brahmas as you're sent to the earth with the Ministry of Eleazar to get a bride for Jesus Christ our Isaac and then so there's the is the World Council of Churches come up and then as the seals as the word is coming up in a 96 is 3 to 65 around that same time the the Vatican is having a Vatican Council called Vatican 2 and their main thrust is it communica lism interfaith they'll dialogue how can we extend a a a hand to two denominations and different religions so what's happening now there's a gathering going on as God is calling as bride revealing himself to call his bride to himself now the world now the Vatican and the World Council of Churches they're coming together well what's happening there's been a rejection there's been a crucifixion and that crucifixion causes ones who once enemies to come together as friends amen but and then also they reach a hand out to the Muslims and to the Buddhists and to the Hindus and different religions and now we're all one big happy family this is where we are he said well how did this happen because this happened this repeated itself that's why this is happening that's why maybe I've seen it well I have seen it before we should bow when you see well what's going on in the world this is the new paper it's all in here this is the newspaper you got to read the message it's the newspaper he's a local correspondent saying this is what's going on in your day amen he sees this and the Misses shalom i read to two different quotes he sees the difference it's just like it was in the beginning this is speaking about Genesis 1 now when there's gross darkness upon the earth and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness I believe we are now living in that hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and the church the reason I'd say shallow which is God's peace to them is because that's that it's God's peace and that's what I want to bring you this morning for the new years not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there's something great laying ahead of us where the years have been the joy that we'll have looked forward to depressing the coming of the great light and now we see it breaking over the horizontal horizontal realm it's breaking between mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from an earthbound sickness and trouble world and to a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body amen an immortal earth that shall never pass away it's Shalom and to the peace I mean I mean unto the church now it's light time coming for the believers but a gross darkness for the people amen there was a 1964 Shalom God's peace rest upon you hallelujah amen don't worry nothing's out of cater nothing's nothing's goin at God's in control this isn't the same message he sees in the same message a little bit later this is where I really want to get to the darkness is separating itself from the light God's causing it the lights doing it see the lights pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together right they had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so it's condensed itself and they do that by putting the church together and the Council of Churches and uniting it with the pagan darkness what happened and what happened there in the first crucifixion his Pilate here's the Sanhedrin and he's herod amen his religious power political power pagan power all comes together right it's congregating together because they didn't accept it they didn't accept Jesus this would never have happened if they accepted him right but it's the light that's doing it now and when they and when they so firmly disagree with one another but yet they had to go together to make the night come upon the people Isaiah 60:1 arise shine for though for the light has come to your rise and shine the light has come the word light has vindicated again the light vindicated again God's word so that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age see these promises that's been made for this day these promises that was said by the prophets and Jesus himself said in this day God in Sandero times Hebrews one God in sundry times and divers manners spake to their fathers through the prophets but in the last days through His Son Jesus Christ see that great light that hung in the wilderness which was that was with Makka that was which was that Moses were suck egypt esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures than that of Egypt the same one that met Saul on the road to Damascus a great light hung before him that same light same pillar of fire Saul being a Hebrew would never worship any spirit or anything of cool at Lord in the position here then he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus jesus said I have come from God I go to God that same light has come - what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day manifested light of the day the darkness is darkened when he come here's the light of the day they were supposed they were supposed to come a messiah and he came just exactly like God said he did would come and when he did what was at the light of the day press the darkness against him is that right he had to give us life that that light would continue could shine he was the light of the day but why was he the light of the day he was the vindicated way that have been spoken made manifest soshe's us the light coming together these ones I mean the darkness congregating itself together because it's rejected the light that's exactly what sits the lights doing it right the lights causing the darkness to come together they meant this is repeated itself again hear it hear it and pile it in our friends right this has been fulfilled we have God and full circle and really when brother Brown was saying about the World Council of Churches you know you darling itself at the pagan darkness many of the great churches weren't in the World Council of Churches at that time not like it is today they weren't in there but now they're all in there and then maybe I should have put the video up but I'll send you a link of of that Anglican bishop Tony Palmer and he go speaks to a Kenneth Copeland's ministers meeting and he has a message from the Pope saying now we're all friends and Anna Lutheran Church has already signed a a joint declaration of faith with the Catholic Church then the then the Methodists did that that same thing a few years after that this is history already and then now he's talking to the charismatic switch were the Pentecostals evolved into the charismatic movement he's speaking to the charismatic movement saying now Luther's protest is over as yours who seen the video what's happening darkness the Pentecostal church brother and says I come to you because you're the you know you're the only ones you would sponsor my meetings initially then they kick them out and he was sitting there in Tucson since I've been here for for over a year and not one of you has invited me to come and speak in your church I've been trying to get in why it hit the manifest behold I stand at the door and knock you see that they were rejecting the man they're rejecting the word that was coming through the man they were ejecting the message Jesus Christ and so now here he is saying Luther's protest is over as yours and these shows a video from the Pope and the post way you know see is basically we're long-lost brothers and then Kenneth consonant stands up and then in the rooms full of thousands of men and they have very big congregations they represent tens of thousands of people and Kenneth Copeland says now the man said we should pray for him let's pray from he says to Tony Palmer can you take a video of my response back to the Pope and he basically says now we're friends we're brothers we've prayed for you you pray for us we'd like to cut and then after that they arranged the meeting and a whole bunch of them big delegation we knew and and met the Pope what's happening darkness is coming together darkness because they rejected the light God's are doing it the lights doing it amen because the tears have to be bound for the burning amen but the weak is to be gathered to the Ghana and the reason I say these things is not to say well those people are like that I say you should rejoice that we're free amen that we are not connected to a system we're connected to Jesus Christ the word holy that we do not serve God through a system we serve them according through his word now we have a real genuine personal relationship with him amen I trust you the reason you're a Christian this night is not because of mommy or daddy or some tradition is it because you meet God yourself I mean the light came upon you the angel of the Lord came the glory of the Lord came around you like the Shepherd's it says don't fear I mean I give you tidings are exceedingly great joy because your Messiah is present Jesus Christ is here I mean to take you from this world to the next world hallelujah glory to God amen the light is doing it you know it's interesting maybe we'll just read this what's the time in my in my Scofield Bible now the the references don't always go but when it speaks about prophesy again before many nations Kindred's and tongues it speaks about it goes to Jeremiah 25 and let's let's just go to Jeremiah 25 let's just read this and then will and will close its amazing Jeremiah Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet he saw the destruction coming and he spent his whole life trying to get the people back to serve God and he died in Egypt with the remnant he told them who's read the Book of Jeremiah that's where he ends up Babylon comes as was prophesied takes the people away he's allowed to stay in the land and then the governor who's there to look after the people he gets killed then the rest of them panic and say let's go down to Egypt we'll be safe there and Jeremiah says don't go you'll be destroyed down there and they take him down there and he dies in Egypt what a what a life to live but he and they came a point in his life he said he will not he said I will not speak now this is not what we were about to read he says I'm not gonna speak about this anymore god I will not be this prophet anymore they said it was like fire in his bones he had to speak he had to speak friends we are in a way like Jeremiah we don't rejoice I don't rejoice when I see darkness right I don't say the people deserve it or whatever more I feel sad for them I feel sad for this world this world has so much potential and yet it's in the gutter but you know that doesn't mean we should be quiet we should live a life you say well I can't preach us them and live a sermon live a life in front of people live a life better that you'll be salty and they may say it's something about that person I may not understand it but something different they mean be salty now Jeremiah Jeremiah 25 15 he sees for thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all nations to whom I send thee to drink it and they shall drink can be moved and be mad because of the sword I will send among them then I then took either Cup at the Lord's hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the Lord had sent me to now let's stop here he didn't literally have a physical cup in his hand and then go to every Nations they drink the strength let's drink this right this is a word he's gonna release that's going to cause us to happen okay - what Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and the kings thereof and the princes are off to make them a desolation and astonishment a hissing and a curse and it is this day Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants and his princess and all those people and all the mingled people and all the people of the land of us and and all the kings of the land of the Philistines and ashkelon and Ezra and Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod and Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon and all the kings of Tyrus and all the kings of Zion and the kings which are many of the Isles which are beyond the sea d-down and team iron buzz and all that are in the out of most corners and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert and all the people I mean so all the kings of summary and all the kings of Elam and all the kings of the Medes and all the kings of the north near far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of XI shash shall drink after them therefore thou shalt Santa diem beside the Lord of Hosts the Lord the God of Israel drinky and be drunken and spew and fall and rise no more because the sword which I will send among you and it shall be if they refuse to drink of the cup at thine hand but to take the cup of on hand to drink then thou shalt say unto the umber said the Lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink so he preached the message now this is probably a big segue but I was but he preached the message and he caused this all to happen by what he preached right but even even if with all that going on his ministry was still fictive what he was called to do now we are not here to preach judgment upon the world our ministry is different right our ministry is a Ministry of deliverance of rapture I mean of of redemption of a full adoption the change of the body that's how that's our ministry right all of us are in that ministry so but you see now this world is falling apart the reason this world is falling apart is because the bride is coming into order with their bridegroom there's a lauren in physics called the second law of thermodynamics where everything tends to entropy or disorder right and it's not only a certain amount of order in the universe so when something comes to order something has to go to disorder is equilibrium right so now the reason this world is falling apart is because there's a people coming into order there can't be two kingdoms here at the same time Daniels vision said that when it comes to the feet of iron and iron and clay which is where we are the Roman Roman Empire has gone to all the world right it's spread brother Brown when he saw thee when he saw the Soviet Soviet Union and and and and and four other said light yo nations of them and then America and then then for other nations then they had a peace you know a conference and the premier of the Soviet Union took offers sure and banged it on the podium and brother and said look we're at the feet cuz iron hat you know Eisenhower means I am Khrushchev with the premier of Soviet you means clay the iron and the clay can't mix and this whole world is united but it's very much divided because iron and clay doesn't mix all that well partially strong partially weak he says we're at the end and then what happens when you're at the end then as the rock comes cut out the mountain without hands strikes the image in the feet and it gets it gets spread oh yeah breaks it into powder and it scattered us no more then that rock becomes a great big mountain fills the whole earth that's the kingdom of God hallelujah where are we we're in that process right that's why this world is falling apart I'll be honest it's later than you think you know we booked Forest Lakes for Nix 2019 labor weekend in 2020 but in my mind a thing that we probably might not be here we might not be here I say Lord may we not be here let's find the last ones we can go home I mean maybe in Vietnam someplace if it is I say how thank you lord I mean let's we're the
