to tell you that we love you tonight and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen um if you'd like to turn with me to Second Timothy good to have sister Marty with us here God bless you good to have you with us um just like to take a bit of a thought I was reading I was reading some scriptures last night and I was looking into lots and words mean and a particular I just want to go into one word here so second Timothy and we'll just read verses uh chapter so in chapter one we're even verse one down to verse six and it says here now well I'm in person I think he's not gonna help me second Timothy Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father and Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unframed faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in the uh I and I'm and sorry I am persuaded that in thee also therefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen May Lord bless his word you may be seated so I want to I just want to go into uh maybe try and continue in some way from from from Sunday speaking about how if we're not divinely led by God and stay surrendered to God everything in life will push us off the road but if we yielded to him as we walk with him it doesn't matter if something bad happens at work or at school or in family or in church or whatever it is because we're surrendered to the Lord he'll keep us in the middle of the way and Timothy here is a classic example of of a believer that Paul is we know that Timothy was he was called to do the work of an evangelist he was in the ministry in that day and you could say he was Paul's Protege you know who who went round with Paul and any and he observed you know the manner of life that the great Apostle Paul had and he and he and he he he was a believer in his day and he saw an example of Christianity and Paul he could say he saw a mature part of the field in Paul he he saw a mature Christian at work and we understand that when Paul is writing letters he's addressing things that they have written to him so he's actually answering questions that or or or things that he's heard he's actually directly addressing things but we understand that these letters not only speak to them like to Timothy but it speaks to every believer down Through the Ages and so Timothy has come to a point in his life where something has happened to him and that's actually caused him to deviate not into sin but something's actually affected his life and it's actually impacted in a bad way upon his walk with God and so Paul is addressing Timothy in a certain way to try and stir him up that whatever's happened in his life will not hold him back but he about to break forever and walk with the Lord as he first did and so this is really the direction I want to go and so Paul it's amazing here where you know just in verse two he says to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father and Christ Jesus our lord now this word Grace here this word Grace you know because I you know you read words you say well we know I understand Grace means unmerited favor but it also it also uh this word here so this is just from the Greek it means graciousness as gratifying a manner or act uh figurative or spiritual especially the Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life there's what this Grace this word Grace means so it means a Divine especially a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life so Paul is telling Timothy here by saying grace be unto you he's he's actually stirring up to me saying think upon the Divine influence that God has put upon your life amen put upon the heart put up the Divine influence that he's put upon your heart this is what he's telling Timothy because we can see as we keep reading God he says therefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God and every gift you know every believer has a gift and that first gift is Faith and that Faith works out according to the office that ain't that a Believer is in his it's either Ministry or helps or governments or you know prayer or you know Paul outlines all the ministry gifts you know all the gifts that are in the body and so he's saying stir up the gift of God because Something's Happened that's caused them to to to withdraw himself in a certain way so he's actually saying this is how you overcome this is to stir up the faith stir up what God has done for you because there's power and testimony and so he's saying think of this Divine influence that that has come upon your heart because Timothy he was raised in a Christian home but there came a point where the god that has grandmother knew and the god that his mother knew became his God so he didn't just hear the stories of what God did for grandma or mump but that God became real to him because Paul says the faith that was in their grandmother lost and my mother Eunice I'm persuaded as indeed so he could see Timothy knew God for himself and we understand that as the most vital thing in all this life is that you know him and the power of his resurrection that's it's not enough just to know about him but you must know him to know him as life we understand the scripture tells us and so there there came a Divine influence upon Timothy's life and that influenced you know you know no doubt if if you know we went back into his life when he was being raised by his mum and dad and these things and we went to him and said Timothy there's a Divine influence upon your life and he'd say what do you mean there's mommy and daddy there's my grandmother's Believers around me all right yo we have church however they had Church in those days they read the you know you read the Bible we pray together and he say this is just everyday life but man so often looks at the wrong kind of thing because in God's eyes that was a Divine influence had come upon Timothy's life and he no doubt is you know as as he was growing up he began to recognize God speaking to me God's calling me God's dealing with my heart you know when conviction Came Upon My Heart or I did something wrong lord said put that right that was divine influence coming down upon Timothy now the heart the heart is the seat you know is the source of thoughts or feelings it's also your mind it's a seed of your affection there's many things that the heart is you know Jesus would say out of the abundance of the you know out of the abundance of the heart does man speak so everything that really comes out of someone's mouth is a reflection of what is in them and so Timothy you know you notice notice he says that this this Divine influence upon you know you know this Divine influence is upon his heart it's not upon his mental thinking or his feelings but it's upon the very core being of himself this Divine influence has come down upon him and so this is this is this is really important because we must understand that you know God doesn't haphazardly just call someone he doesn't just haphazardly say maybe I'll pick this person from this place and then I'll call them but God has a purpose of calling people and it's not just to use them to further his work but God has always been looking for parts of himself down Through the Ages when Adam and Eve fell part of Godfather and so God had to redeem them because they were part of himself amen so down Through the Ages God has been looking for parts of himself amen and so that's why that's why a Divine influence comes upon us is because God begins to brood over us to really draw out the real us and you see Genesis chapter one you know you see the creation that is not only God revealing his creation but speaks of what God does to the human soul because it says in the beginning God made heavens and earth there's a period there's a full stop and multitudes of schools of thought stumble over the full stop when it comes to age and then it says the darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and if you continue to read the chapter the seeds are already in the Earth but they're covered up with Darkness they covered up with water you know and then but the spirit of God begins to brood over the face of the deep amen and man we understand in the Book of Revelation is spoken of as multitudes Nations and tugs is is water amen and so now God the speaks of God's Great Redemption plan as he's been brooding over the Earth I mean from from the beginning even to now he's been brooding in every age doesn't matter if it was in Moses's time or Jeremiah's time or Elijah's time or Jesus or the apostles or Martin Luther God has been brooding over the Earth because God knows his seat down in the earth in this great multitude of people there's like a a tenth or a type of humanity he's going to take for himself and so he's been brooding over the Earth to find you amen and so now Divine influences upon this Earth we can see that just by looking in the word and looking at what we see around us is that there's a Divine influence and it's calling the hearts of men and women and children to come to where they came from to come to their makers so we see that as God would God would brood over the Earth in Genesis there you know he separates the light and darkness he you know he causes the land to come up separates the waters and then then finally the seed comes forth it's already in the Earth because when it says let there be light that word Let There Be actually means for it to appear amen and so God God brewed it over the Earth to bring out the life that is in it you see and God had a purpose he didn't just come to this earth and say well this is a nice planet now I'll just I'll just I'll just brood over and see what's in it he knew what was under all that darkness and when he came and began to brood over you he knew what was underneath the darkness amen he knew what was buried it might have been buried deep in in in in cultural or religion or you know whatever it was something was buried deep but he knew it was there amen and so he was brooding to find that which you know which was in there and then begin to draw it out and God because God is a gentleman he allows he has to actually let you know he actually waits for you to respond hey Broods but then the one he's brooding over has to react back to the one that's drawing him amen he the other person because remember out of the heart you know the heart you have to open your open your life Surrender Your Life to him see I've got to be willing he comes to you he Broods you feel his presence but then you have to respond the believer has to respond and so Timothy came to a place in his life where he responded and God began to use Timothy in a mighty way now Timothy this word here for God has not given us the spirit of fear this word fear actually speaks of being timid that is faithless or fearful but the main meaning of it is actually being timid and so he's saying because memories meant to do the work under evangelist so whatever you're called to do in life Satan will actually come your way to stop you doing what you meant to be called to do so how do you stop an evangelist how do you stop an evangelist make him lose his confidence hey man cause them to withdrawal make him feel timid because remember evangelist is a bold you know they're built as a bold and a bold anointing comes and you know they preach with you know they're not they're not scholarly people they're built a different way so Timothy was actually the devil did something to him to try and hinder what he was called to do in that age I mean because he's called to do the work of an evangelist he wasn't an evangelist called to do the work of an evangelist you see so and you can see that you can see it you know Godly sisters who are who are mothers and you know who are who are wives what happens your call to that office what happens the Devil comes along your way and tries to you know it comes against that and cause you to withdraw from what you're called to be you see that in every facet of Life the devil deals with us differently because he sees he sees the potential in you what you're trying to achieve and what you feel you know as soon as you begin to because he doesn't know what you're thinking the devil can't read your thoughts so as soon as you begin to confess and speak thinks he's there and he's listening because he knows who you are we know Thou Art come you know Jesus you know Thou Art the Holy One of Israel have you come to tormentors before the time they knew who he was hello Mrs Jesus Christ who's the feminine attribute of him amen if if the devil knew who he was he certainly knows what you are he's without a doubt he knows who you are and so he will he will cause he will try and derail you like he tried to derail Timothy to come exactly against what you're called to be in this day and hour and it doesn't matter it like you can take it into business you'll try and ruin your confidence in you know in in the Lord's leadership and business or as a father or as a mother he'll try and get you to be discouraged I mean but God has not given us the spirit of fear or to be timid Amen to lose confidence in what you are remember a few if you have family you're you're being ordained to be a a husband or a wife amen or a father or a mother God is God has placed you in a position God has confidence the reason he gave you his seed to raise remember children are not ours they just are lit to us for a season but he he because he wanted to have he wanted to reflect himself the little ones in this age so God chose you to do it amen God wants Godly grandmas and godly husbands and wives and mothers and fathers and so he actually ordained you like he spoke to Moses he ordained Moses to do a work or Peter James or John or Paul or brother Branham they are ordained to do her work and your work is just as important as their work Amen brother Bramble is a dispensational prophet he has a prophet to the age and he was called to that and he lived out his calling but we are called under that same word you know the prophet tells us that the bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age he says in the church age book and so he says these things that we can understand we are called to a certain work how do you be a voice and look you know a voice is not preaching on the street corner but to be a voice is to live the word or Jesus comes and lives in you and that and you become a voice now you become you actually become a preacher every day you may never say a word but your life preaches to this world so you've been ordained to preach this gospel to every creature amen this is what you've been called to do but the devil will try and push you off the road and you'll lose confidence see he tries to you know sometimes the devil will plug away at you as hard as he can that doesn't mean you're not in the will of God amen don't be discouraged and whatever you're doing if it's raising children going to work whatever you're called to do don't be discouraged be rugged I mean thank God in his word you say every every bomb of Hell's Falling on My Head say praise the Lord amen amen don't be God has not given us the spirit of fear Timothy lost his you know you know he lost he lost his confidence he withdrew amen and so Paul was rallying him say you know stir up the gift of faith that you have amen that this Divine think of remember the Divine influence has come upon your life amen come upon your heart there's a Divine influence has come and the reason it has come is because your part you're part of him remember God came to seek and save that which was lost so he came to find bits of himself that were lost amen and then I trust you can say tonight I have been found what does that mean I was lost and now I'm found I was blind but now I see where were you lost from you came out of the thoughts of God you expressed in time amen and because you were born in this Fallen fallen way you were lost and undone and you needed redeeming because brother Brown tells us you know we are we are Eternal beings the believer is an eternal being living out in time we're not time beings we're not time beings exp you know experiencing A Bit of Heaven but we're Heavenly beings experiencing a bit of time because brother Brandon brings it very simply he says to have eternal life it doesn't mean you get it one day and now you have eternal life you always had eternal life that you just had to recognize who your daddy was amen and then and then when that happens and you recognize that he paid the price for you then Faith Comes amen then you begin to recognize what you are when the church when the bride recognizes what she is then the Rapture will come well then the Rapture will go when she recognizes that it wasn't Hazard that that you heard the voice of God in your day it wasn't a haphazard thing that you gave yourself to him it wasn't it's not a haphazard thing it's premeditated by God he knew the season he knew the hour that you would be here you know brother Brown tells us and who is this Melchizedek he says Melchizedek was God in another in a theophany form where he came and spoke to Abraham amen and then so what happened is as God went from invisible God to theophany and then he went to and he became flesh in Jesus Christ the same God all the way down from before Genesis 1 1 he came down into flesh can't the gods ain't God condescending down through the Bible and he said but the prophet said that is why Jesus in some places said he knew all things is because he went from you know from theophany to flesh but brother man tells us that we didn't go theophany we do we bypassed our theophany and came to flesh amen so he's telling us now that we're Eternal as God is eternal because if this Earthly Tabernacle this thing be dissolved we have one waiting Eternal in the heavens an eternal body so it doesn't mean it's being built it's already built it's already there waiting for us amen and so the very reason that God we hear the voice you know when I heard brother Brandon for the first time it spoke to me like nothing else has ever spoken to me in my entire life I mean it took me a while to surrender but I gave myself to it when I came to realize my friends you know I was scared my friends would leave me but just having their they were they're good people but just having them as friends didn't give me peace hey man it didn't give me said it didn't give me lasting satisfaction but then when I fully surrendered to the Lord and then he came and then I had the peace then I had the satisfaction and so what happens is because we have that Eternal we have a body waiting in the heavens every believer has one and because we have that when we hear the voice of God speaking it speaks to us like nothing else does amen because that's an eternal voice that doesn't come out of a map you know it didn't come out of Kentucky didn't come out of Jeffersonville that voice came out of heaven amen because Moses when Moses was speaking it wasn't Moses speaking when he said thus saith the Lord it wasn't thus saith Moses speaking that was God using a man to speak to his people and the people who recognize this is more than Moses sure we walk with him in the desert sure we've seen where he was raised and you know in Pharaoh's house and we've seen all the different things but this is more than this man speaking and when they recognize this was God speaking to us and they said the promise Belongs To Us the land belongs to us the the resurrection belongs to us and they receive what they wanted or what they needed because they believed it was for them you understand so it wasn't Moses speaking it was thus saith the Lord it was God speaking and the reason the reason that something in this response to that voice is because we have a body waiting in the heavens amen that is the reason it's not because we're good people or we're religious people or what that's that's irrelevant but the very reason there's something in here that responds is because there's a body calling for me to enter into that body there's a deep calling to the deep and the prophet tells us very simply if there's a deep there has to be deep there up in heaven in order for there to be a deep here and if there's a longing if you have a long in your heart I want more of Jesus that means there's more of Jesus to have that means there is a Jesus to have amen and the very reason matters is because there's a body waiting for me amen does not have as this this walk is not a haphazard walk it's not a you know we're Eternal beings just in time I mean just for us to mold out character Hallelujah you know that's why that's why the prophet he you know he went he went before there was a molecule and then he went all the way back to the heaven you know new heavens and new earth as whole Ministry expanded that big span is because he was showing now this is where you come from the very mind of God and then this is where you're going to end up in new heavens and new earth where sin and everything is just done away with us not even a memory amen so we're Eternal beings I trust you know just just think about this world a bit different you know it's not well I'm from here and I have this problem and this is going wrong all those it's all good amen when you come to the end of yourself just let them take you the rest of the way amen that's all you need to do Hallelujah that's all you need to do Hannah had a burning desire to have a son amen at a great Junction in in Israel's history she had a burden I must have a child she had a burden oh hello and the and and even the priesthood couldn't discern her need gotta read the story but she had a great need but the reason she had that need is because God needed a prophet upon the Earth to anoint a king amen so so God was working God was working both ends amen so if you have a desire to serve the Lord that's because God is working the other end amen and so God tells I mean yeah God tells Timothy but to say God told Timothy to stir up the gift that's within thee God told it wasn't Paul saying these things God told them that amen so Timothy he was trying to be and it's amazing because he says be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but the but be thou partakers of the Affliction of The Gospel According to the power of God so he's actually saying don't be uh he's saying here don't be ashamed not only of the Lord but don't be ashamed of the messenger I mean don't be ashamed of the messenger Hallelujah so now Timothy you know now this this unfrained faith it means it means a sincere faith without hypocrisy he was genuine he had a genuine faith and Paul I'm just maybe I just repeat myself for a little bit but I trusted sinks in you I trust you can put yourself in Timothy's shoes the devil's tried to deep probably derail you even today amen something goes wrong and you begin to condemn yourself you're not good you're not a good dad you're not a good husband you failed again you're no good at your job amen and the devil uses the devil tries to derail you that you would actually the spirit he has not given us a spirit of fear of being timid about it we're called in this day to possess what God has given us amen and it doesn't and and and that can be to be a housewife to be a real housewife to be a real husband to be a real wife to be a real brother or father or mother or whatever whatever we're called to be God has called us to you know to possess fully what what that is to be so what does that mean so if you're a parent that means you don't shine your responsibility of being a parent amen or or if you're in business or working doesn't mean you shun your you know shun your responsibility because Ahab shunned his responsibility and Jezebel took the throne amen because he didn't fully you know possess the office and he was called to call to be in so we're not called to do that friends remember God remember this this Divine expect the Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life so Grace enables you to live the word that's what Grace does it enables you to live the word so Timothy was being reminded he was being reminded of these things and this is important because here is the first church age messenger telling the Next Generation he's instructing a few a younger generation because soon after this Paul's head's going to be taken off he's going to go on to glory and that voice is going to be silenced and now it's the next generation's burden now to pick up the mantle amen and to keep declaring the word and we we're 50 years down the road amen I've never been to Jeffersonville you know I've never you know but but it falls out a lot and then I'm not just talking about gathering in this building and having church I mean I mean in family life it's fallen out a lot to live this word amen and you know even in the smallest thing it's Fallen our lot I mean the burden has been placed upon our shoulders it's a Timothy he's you know verse 9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which he has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but has now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light unto the gospel where unto I'm appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles so Paul is telling Saint Paul if we can just get our mind off Earthly things sure we're called to have family you know do all the natural things I'm not saying forget about those things but we need to look beyond what we see and conditions of life and how things affect us naturally because it's a Timothy he needed to recognize what had come against him wasn't a flesh and blood Affair but the devil was fighting against him to try and to try and uh you know you know immobilize him that he couldn't do the work he was called to do and so that's why now Paul is saying now that this you know this holy calling was not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which he has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began so so he's saying to God is telling Timothy this calling and this purpose that you've been called to do was ordained before the foundation of the world Amen it's already been you were you weren't called haphazardly he's trying to tell him we weren't called haphazardly amen you say this may be very very Elementary it's not Elementary if we can if we can recognize that we're part of God himself that God has called us because he's looking for parts of himself and our walk in this Earth has been pre-arranged by God our footsteps have been pre-arranged and everything that comes into our life is because God is ordained it amen and the devil wants to discourage you because of what you view as your failings amen that's why he says it's not by works this holy calling is not according to our works because the other devil loves to snowball things you get discouraged and then he pours upon that discouragement and then you withdraw a little bit more and you say there's no way I can do these things and and he just pours it on you am I the only one who does that too you see so he tries to he tries to discourage you but you know stir up the gift of faith I mean stir up stir up what's in your heart don't look at don't let these things you down but stir up the gift because brother man tells us that the true you know laying on of hands is not to impart gifts it's a recognition of the gift that's already there because gifts and callings are without repentance hey man so so he's encouraging him to stir up the gift that's within him amen not to let the devil get him down now we're called we are called in the same way that God would use us for a work now sometimes we get in our mind and and I and I've already mentioned this earlier but sometimes we get in our mind it must be of the law because everything's going fine sometimes that's true sometimes the devil fights against everything he can do amen but you've got to know what you're called to do and if it's settled in your heart I you know I've been ordained to do a certain thing all the guns of hell can be shooting fully automatic on you and it won't won't cause you to bother a bit amen you've got to know what you're called to do and then stay true to that vision stay true you know it doesn't matter if it's family doesn't matter if it's job or church or whatever it is stay true to the vision whatever you do stay true to what God has called you to do remember God's called us to take a Rapture I'm just gonna I'm just going to bring it down God's called us to take a rapture I mean stay true to the vision that God has sent a word in this end time to prepare us for the rapture amen God has called us to be lifted up to be joint heirs with him and that's what his Redemption has caused in US and if he has done that remember this holy calling but according see it's according to his own purpose so don't you know sometimes people get intimidated all the bride how can I ever become the bride brother bam says the bridegroom call will come right through this speaking of his own message and I was listening to Invisible Union and then in the beginning of that sermon he says there'll come a message which will sweep out and it'll catch the bride and then not so there's not verbatim but but down through that ceremony says he says the messages gone out to catch the bride amen so the very reason that we have responded to the word is because we are what God is looking for amen God is looking for a part of he's looking for the feminine part of himself he's looking for himself you know you know he's looking for himself and Bride for amen this is what he's he's not looking for servants he's not looking for Palace guards or just some Lackey some some some you know kitchen hand or something but he's looking for royalty and and so that you know if that's what he's looking for he'll send his word to find what he's looking for and so he and so so something's in you has responded to the word it's because you are that Royal lady that is looking for amen that's it now he he sends his word to accomplish certain things and he sent this word now so so we get you know we get so we get so sometimes intimidate oh how could I ever be the bride of Christ and brother Brown tells us that before the foundation of the world he put the wedding band of unmerited predestinated Grace upon your finger amen this is what he tells us so because you responded like the apostles they responded to the word because they are ordained to be the apostles hey man all the ones Through the Ages they were they were ordained and they responded to the word sent to them because they were the missing part of that word you understand you know it's like if I'm going to call the Queen I'm going to call the Queen and my intent is to get in touch with the queen Amy I'm not going to call I'm not going to call my next door neighbor no they're probably you know they're nice people but if I want the queen I'm going to call England I'm going to call Buckingham Palace to get the queen so if God wants the bride he's going to send a prophet that's that that's has all the gifts of Father's house and he's going to send a word out upon the Earth and then when that word registers in someone's heart it's because God is contacting his Queen so now we are called and then also you know we're we're called to you know finish the Great Commission you say how can we do that we are fulfilling the Great Commission even as we speak right now I mean some people think of some great big lofty thing sure it sounds like an incredible thing but it's just living day to day looking on you you know you know when you meet people Lord is this one of them your brother Brown says Don't Force It Down them if they're interested they'll ask you amen so if you feel the leading share it you know uh who I I don't know brother I'm sitting or something yo there's a quite yo someone said Lord fill my mouth with good things that give me a nod or something when I've said too much or when I've said enough you see so us going around no brother had to give me our testimony right yo someone's sharing with someone that is fulfilling the Great Commission amen oh that's how every day it is everyday things simple things us walking we are God's billboard us driving you know walking down the street whatever we do everyone sees you and if I and people talk about you I mean why because you're a billboard you're you're advertising you're advertising something and that's all part of fulfilling the Great Commission and then he's also called us to have a perfect union between husband and wife yo he's called us to to raise children in the love of the Lord I mean to have a real Sanctuary a bit of Eden on the Earth in our homes this is what he's called us to do all these things you know you know he's called us to you know because you know people take Prosperity Gospel and they take it way off but God said he'll Bliss amen but he'll give you the character to handle that blessing amen as well but he said I'll just bless and then so and then he's called us to be real you know what a real friend is or real Brother's Keeper I mean to be a real believer he's called us to be all these things you know Jesus said because of iniquity the love of many will wax cold so it is our responsibility that the love of God never leave us I mean individually I'm speaking because if it leaves individual it'll leave collectively but because of iniquity because iniquity affecting people the love of many will wax coal so they'll come to a point where only true love only real love is actually among the bride of Christ worldwide it'll come to a place well no I'm not talking about just well what the world calls love is not love because that's selfish love what can I get out of this situation that's not love that's being selfish but the world projects it is love but it's not real love why what's happened because only love now real love is among the bride of Christ I believe it you just go look on the you know you go look out there for a little bit you'll see true love and you know that's why there's like Pastor Beckett 43 years married I think it was yeah yeah he sent me a package you put a card in there you know they celebrate their marriage yeah 43 years and there's some others being married all that time you're like brother Greg you know they've been married I don't know maybe 40 years as well and they and they had there was a you know they went over to their neighbors had a had a meal with them and some friends and all of them like married two or three times same age why what's happened you know and that's the world just you know the devil just destroys people I'm not saying it's their fault it's the conditions they're living in but you see because there's real love it'll it'll weather storms and good times and bad times and happy and sad times but there'll be a uniting force that'll keep us together and you can see that in the older brethren amen so the devil will do everything he can I'm just going to wrap this up it's not very long but I trusted you know he'll try and derail you and he'll do everything he can to derail you and sometimes it's just a question and we just and he says well what about this and we just focus on that our whole life becomes focused on something that doesn't really you know I've got lots of questions but I don't focus on them I'd put them on the shelf and I continue to walk with God amen how does this work why does this happen I don't know he'll tell me one day if he wants if he wants me to know something he'll tell me amen I have that confidence so you know this he'll try and derail you in any way he can like he tried to do Timothy amen but it is our it is our job but but if he ever tries to do that you know brother brownie said in one place no he said in more than one place he said Sinners enticing he's just being honest sin is enticing to the Natural man you say oh how could you say that he said it amen so sin is enticing and if the devil can he'll get you derailed of something that that appears to be pleasurable amen because it's just pleasurable for a season that's why people love to do it hey come on we're people too hey man you can't say well we're holy than now and things of the world don't affect us they do whether we like it or not because we're still in these bodies amen it didn't mean when we received the Holy Ghost who come unplugged from everything and there's no trials or you know things of our past maybe we don't entice us anymore there'll be nothing in here that'll wanted but this thing still remembers it amen see he'll try and derail you on all these kinds of things but whatever you do don't forget the Divine influence that's come upon your life don't be little the bridegroom call will come right through this he said as a direct Pro he said the broken call will come right through this and if it's spoken to your heart that means yeah because a bridegroom call is a marriage call that's a uniting call and so he's saying now that this this word has come to cause you to become one with Christ an invisible Union would take place and then what happens I think something and you just responded see we need to forget you know there's land to possess there's a promised land this this thing has to come under subjection there's you know promises you know there's a there's a promised land to possess but just because we lose one battle doesn't mean we're not ordained to take the land it doesn't mean that we're not the true blue seed of God hey the Israelites you know they had the failure with AI and then they got rid of the sin out of the camp and they just continued on amen and then they took all the land that that you know yo yo with Joshua there then finally with King David they possessed the fullness of the promised land but just because they had a defeat didn't mean the you know you know because not only they just threw up and went back to Egypt threw up their hands and walked back to Egypt they just kept pressing on amen because they were looking at the promise more than their failures amen and if the devil can get you to look at your failures or you away from the promise what did he do with Timothy he would have done the same thing caused them to look at his and what he perceived as failures in himself you know the devil where do negative thoughts come from they don't come from God they come from Satan so if there's anything and remember God pulls us to himself that's why it's called the third pull it's not a push or a kick there's a drawing you've been drawn to the Lord and I'm sure there's a burden of sin that you know you know there's a burden we have to lay down but God doesn't always he points out what you should be as opposed to what you shouldn't be amen for me he doesn't beat me down with my imperfections amen but he makes them real that I can give them to him that he can mold me is a fine line amen so the devil will come your way and you'll point out what you perceive as imperfections in yourself and he'll beat you all day with them amen and then what happens you're focusing on you're not focusing on the promise anymore you're focusing on what you appear as weakness but we forget that there's perfect strength and perfect weakness amen God allows us yeah look at look at the Apostle Paul he says he says he you know he is buffeted by that agent of Satan that thorn of his flesh least the abundance of Revelation that he had would would make him puffed up so God allowed that agent in his life I mean to keep him a certain way now remember he prayed and God told him this is why this is there do never never assume that what you perceive as some fading in your life is because God allowed it don't assume it you pray until God says yes or no amen but Paul he just kept walking with the Lord and he he began to Rejoice that God's strength was perfect in his weakness he didn't begin to just focus on his weakness all the time and say Paul me look at my weakness amen you know yeah there's a fight you know as I said Saturday there's a fine line between identifying a scar and nursing it and identifying a scar and being healed of it and it's the same thing with a weakness some things the Lord reveals and calls you to fail they say Lord take it from me but there's other things that he puts in you that you'll stay dependent upon him amen and there's no shame in that amen but trust I but you need to pray till you know which one's which amen because some people say well the Lord you know I've heard some some brethren say well the Lord allows us in my life to keep me humble and I always think are you sure has the Lord told you that because if the Lord's told you that then praise him but but if it's something you're just kind of shielding and keeping say you need to let go of that thing amen so we didn't you know this land if the devil can get us see Timothy got his eyes off the fact that he was called by God is a Divine influence upon his life it was God's purpose that he was to do the work of evangelists that God had ordained them to do these things because he came from God and he's going to go back to God this is what Timothy forgot and he was looking at his humidity his his humility and he began to withdraw and he became it has gone down the road of becoming ineffective unbelievable but but he is becoming ineffective you see because he was looking at at something carnally as in this is some problem about me as opposed to this I mean we need to look at the word Above All Things friends amen because if we take our eyes off him then then the devil really has us amen how we need to look at the word amen they're up the gift God has not given us a spirit of fear of power love and a sound mind you know when Jesus Jesus said to the seraphenician woman that that the crumbs you know you know the other bread side so I can't remember the story exactly but you know the story Sarah Phoenician woman comes and her daughter is afflicted by a devil and she says Thou son of David have mercy on me he doesn't even respond because she was approaching him the wrong way he says Lord God be merciful and then he begins to address her and and he basically says that the dogs are not meat to eat at the table but then she says yeah but the dogs get the crumbs you know that fall down that word dog meat someone was someone that's in pure mind does not have a pure mind that's what that word dog means so he is actually calling her someone who is an impure mind so that is less to me than an animal like a dog you see but you're saying yay Lord you know sure I may be a dog to you but yeah there's still a promise the crumbs still fall that that people like us can receive what we need see she kept her focus upon the word and she got what she needed a lot of people would say how did he say I've got a second pure mind and you know they were just to you know walk the other way but because she kept her eyes on the word the Lord was testing her faith amen the Lord was testing her faith and the Lord will test your faith by allowing you to be discouraged or not being answered the way you think you should be answered amen but because she kept her eyes on the word she didn't let it get to her that she was a dog she actually acknowledged hey I I remember your mind I don't have the mind of Christ amen but she kept her eyes on the wood and she got what she needed amen how about you amen let's bow heads in the water
