thank you musicians I mean good morning everyone god bless you I've been great here everyone here I mean great to have the servants this here from Auckland god bless you and then especially feel at home does it feel welcome god bless you amen let's go to let's go to Joshua chapter 10 and then we're going to go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 we go Joshua 10 we're just going to read from verse 16 down to verse 28 I mean I trust Sunday school started with a hiss and a roar and then God bless you all I mean all the teachers and all all the young people we love our young people amen I mean Joshua 10 will read from verse 16 down to verse 28 this is after we know Joshua has stopped the Sun and the moon and they've had a great victory and the victory is not over he says but these five Kings fled and hid themselves in the cave Makeda that's how you say that and it was told Joshua saying the five kings have found hid in the cave of Magda and Joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and said men buy it for to keep them and stay Enoch but pursue after your enemies and smite the hide most part of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand and they came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fence cities and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at magda and peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel then said Joshua opened the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of jonatha king of lesha Schleicher and the king of egg long and it came to pass when they brought out those kings under Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which were with him come near put your foot upon the neck of these kings and they came near and they put their feet upon the necks of them and Joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and be of good courage for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies whom you fight and afterwards Joshua smote them and slew them and hang them on the five trees and they were hang upon the trees until the evening and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the Sun that Joshua commanded and took them down off the trees cast him into the cave were and they were had been heard and they great stones in the caves mouths which remain until this very day and that day Joshua took Mac down smited with the edge of the sword and the king there off he athlete astroid them and all the souls that were therein he let none remaineth he did to the king of Magda as he did unto the king of Jericho I mean let's just turn to 2nd Peter chapter 1 and in verse 16 taking Peter 1 and 16 this is for we have not followed cunningly devised fables which ye when we made known unto the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but where I witnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased in this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with them in the holy mount and we also am we have also do sorry we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine a--the in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for and why is that because for the prophets for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost I mean may the Lord this is word this morning you may have your seats and I'd like to take if I could titled us this morning it may seem an odd kind of a title but I want to speaking going from partial to complete realization now we read here in Joshua and others just a bit of a background but Joshua you know they just fought a mighty you know you know a mighty battle there they had won a great victory but but Joshua wanted I believe that the king that you know that the captains of the men of war would place their feet on the neck of these kings that they would get a full realization that they have dominion over this land that maybe when they were fighting or maybe when Jericho was coming down they had you know begin to dawn on them that this was actually their time to take the land that they were actually conquering but they had to come a time where it wasn't just a partial understanding but it became a full complete understanding we have Dominion and you know so they had to so it had to become a reality in their hearts that this land was theirs and it's the same thing with you and I when we look at the Word of God and every promise that God has given to the bride in this day it has to become a reality it's mine everything Jesus Christ died for it's mine it's not maybe mine it's mine I'm ensign and I believe that we're living in a season where we are coming into a complete realization of everything Jesus died for for for us to receive every everything in the book that belongs to us is now in the possession of the bride but we need to realize this is ours now we read here in 2nd Peter you know because this is a you know we are coming into a you're a new day we know that time is blending with eternity and the Apostle Peter would would speak here and he'd say that you know we have a more sure word of prophecy run to you do well if you take heed as unto a light that shine a--the in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your heart so he's saying here that we have so we have a more sure word of prophecy and you will do well if you take heat to it so if you pay attention to it if you observe it if you read it if you listen to it and and we know on this day we have a more sure word of prophecy you know has there ever been a generation upon the earth where you can go and you can listen to God discerning the thoughts intents of the heart seeing the son of man being revealed see the mystery the book come open I mean God's own God had his photograph taken with a prophet of God we have evidence upon evidence of the reality of what God is fulfilling in our day I say no generations like this one I mean with a word of prophecy has been made sure where it's not just man standing up and saying well I think this is what it says and they can back that up by a bunch of learning and and scholarship and degrees but a man could stand in the pulpit and he could say this is thus saith the Lord he says now if I be a true servant of God let him come now and vindicate what I've said and God would come down and supernaturally prove what the Prophet was saying this was now God's Word so you know now that what's us now it's no longer man's opinion or man's idea of the scripture now it's God coming and saying this is what my word means hallelujah so we have a word we have a more sure word of prophecy in this thing now so he says but yo you will do well if you take heed to it as a light that shine a--the into a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your heart so now he says if see we should take heed to this word of like you're waiting for the day to dawn now who's ever got up waiting for a sunrise I could maybe only do it maybe I remember at the year 2000 year 2000 we lived in Gisborne and then we lived at winery beach and um we we walk down to the lighthouse many of you have no idea what I'm talking about that's fine it's like it was the first city to see the Sun so we would get up and we were there waiting for the for the for the data dawn and so we're under expectation but we were taking heed waiting for the day and then we know before the Sun comes over the horizon you can see the sun rays begin to come over the horizon until finally the sun itself begins to rise up so he's saying that you should we need to take heat of this more sure word of prophecy like someone who's waiting for the day to dawn now when when the day dawns we know it's always darkest before dawn we know that but then but then as the Sun begins to rise but then then then the heat of the day begins to manifest into the light you know the light where you could just look at the look at the horizon and you can see the sunrise coming up it's no longer just rising up and actually going above you the Sun rises and the race hit you and then and then as as the day gets brighter and brighter and brighter you begin to see where you are you begin to see who you are I mean because in the darkness you can't really make out who you are you can't make out even where you're standing amen but then as as the day as the Sun begins to rise you begin to see who you are you begin to see where you're standing I mean so as the as this day is dawned as the Sun as the eson has risen I mean Anna's son raised has has has come upon us we begin to see who he is but not only that we begin to see who we are I mean and we begin to see where we are standing in Christ it means it's no longer guessing well I think I'm redeemed I think I you know I think I'm going in a rapture I think I'm gonna overcome now you begin to realize I am redeemed I mean the blood of lamb is enough hallelujah I have been purchased by his blood I am going in a rapture I mean I will overcome I have overcome because he already has overcome I mean as the Prophet would say in how can I overcome he says the one who over all things I meant a faith in you you've already overcome because he he overcame all temptation he overcame all spirits he overcame the culture of his day he overcame everything that can be named he conquered it that day and he rose triumphant if that one is in you you will overcome because he already has it means it's not a question am I going to overcome no the overcomers in you so therefore you will overcome well you can't help overcoming because he's in you to overcome I think that should make us happy amen so that means that overcome will overcome my first nature hallelujah I'll speak I'll say that on my behalf hallelujah amen I'd say you know he will overcome all things now because he's already overcome it so that's like when you're standing there waiting for the day to dawn we were standing on the beach there and I'm not trying to do any tourism for the East Coast but you know it's quite a lovely place and you know we were there on the beach I think we know who actually climbed up a bit we're on the cliffs and we were looking and it was a bit cloudy but you know when the Sun came up we really saw where we were standing and it gave us actually a full realization it wasn't just a I think it's going to happen no oh I think I'm here I know I've arrived that's the same thing with when the word has come into full manifestation now that's it it's like a light shining into a dark place we were in it this world is a very dark place but it's a very bright place at the same time I mean it depends what you're paying heed to so until the day dawn and the day star rise in your heart so we have to come to a see a a partial realization now I I was reading the church age book and brother band speaks about these things as why I'm here but a partial understanding is not complete it's just a part of it and down through the church ages there's been a partial understanding the book has already been here right the scripture has always been here but there was only a partial understanding through the church ages as as the Reformation was dawning I mean there was only a partial understanding of what grace really was there's only a partial understanding of what the blood can do because if you go into the Philadelphia age with on Wesley he he he believed very strongly and works and of course there is no faith without works is dead we understand that but they even subconsciously begin to build within themselves that it's the blood and works because they had a partial understanding of God's saving power God's transforming power but now we've come into an age of a full realization we realize that it is nothing but the blood is not Jesus plus your own good conduct no it is the blood of Jesus Christ only a means and there is power in that blood to cause you to live a holy life it's not us trying to have a method of sanctification like the Methodists did that was a partial realization but now we're living a time of complete realization where we know that there is power in the blood that causes us to live a holy life I mean cause the stoever come causes us to abstain from the things of the world it's not us trying to keep ourselves it's his keeping power in us that keeps us how lujah so brother man would say in in in the message Shalom in 1964 he says now every true Hebrew when he meets another at Shalom other words good morning god be with you God's peace be with you it's good morning how do you do it's breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but it's a good morning to the church Christ is appearing among us Shalom peace hallelujah Shalom when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging yonder to introduce the coming Sun that's what's when the morning stars that's when the morning star shines it's the going between it's always darkest just a few minutes before day the black out comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness the morning star comes out into his good morning Shalom that's him among us his word being identified Shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when it's chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there our names are on his book will be there Shalom good morning peace be upon you the darkness operating itself from the life God's caused it the lights are doing it so he's saying that the light as it beacons of shine pushes the darkness together and we can see darkness is gathering has already gathered together I mean but it's the light that's doing it it's not the darkness doing it it's actually the light pushing itself pushing the darkness together so we we are living in it now to me this you know when he speaks about Christ is appearing among us that SCIM among us is word being manifested Shalom that's more than a your a sermon or a nice idea it's got to be a reality this is him among us this is him doing the work this is him that called me him that saved me him that's keeping me I mean it's him appearing among us now the scripture would tell us in 1st Corinthians 13 now I'm going to come back to Joshua I'm just want to laying this foundation and we'll see where we go but a first Corinthians 13 he says when I was a child this is the Apostle Paul saying I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am knowing so he's saying that you know I was once a child but when I grew when I matured I put away childish things now those things weren't done away with they were just put in their right place right but then now he says for that for now we look through a glass darkly this is he there saying this is how the church is right but then face to face there's got to come a time when we see him face to face and I believe we're living in that time right for now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am knowing so he saying that the church will come to a place where where now we we that are speaking in his day saying now I have a partial realization even though he is prophesying of things of the entire man and and where the church would arrive it be saying now I know in part but then I shall know as I am knowing so there has to come a time when the bride begins to realize and no I meant know who they are as God knows her I mean that they're not just having a partial understand well maybe I'll make it maybe things will work out maybe all be okay and oh it's just bad like this happen and this is this way and you know some kind of human reasoning evolved no no we have a full realization amen of who we are in Jesus Christ that we know is we are no and now brother Brown would speak in harvest time and he'd say Amen at now I'm getting religious I feel good he says the first church that first Eve which was to be Christ's bride how many can say I'm into that she was to be Christ's bride she was born at Pentecost not at Nicaea Rome not in London England not in the United States not in Germany with Luther not in England with Wesley not in the United States with the Pentecostal so-called she was born on the day of Pentecost your spirit felt your spirit filled and word fed every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and how they just but they just had to take everything just word by word a real blooming plant on God's earth representing him another bride tree his word of promise reflected him in her I mean to say now that this that this bride that he's speaking about here it's the same as when Eve was taken out of Adam now when Eve was taken out of Adam and she came to herself she uh you know you know it was Adam that came to even said your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life you shall be called woman because you came out of man and it's the same thing in this day we we we are born with spiritual amnesia we don't know where we're from we don't know where we're going we think well I'm Canadian I'm American I'm an Kiwi I'm a South African I'm all River you're from you know but then God comes along and he declares to you it's not you telling yourself he comes to you and says no your bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh your word of my word your spirit of my spirit you are you shall be called the bride because you came out of me you came out of the group just as Eve the first Eve came out of Adam Amen so when Jesus was hanging on Calvary there was the blood water and spirit came out of him that was the material a meant to make the Bride of Christ holy and down through seven Church ages that bride is being built I mean so we have to come to a full realization we are part of his word we are part of I mean just as Adam could not lose Eve because Eve was a part of him so Christ could not lose you I meant you can go look into you know with Abraham and Sarah brother Brahim said when Sarah laughed within herself doubting the promise of the visitation that she would receive you know the promised son you know brother Bram says well God God killer could have killed her right there but but because she was part of the promise she couldn't kill Sarah cause of her doubt and because of where part of the promise we're part of the promise word of this now I mean God can't cut yo God can't destroy us even if we're there doubt frustration or maybe because we're part of his word hallelujah amen so you know we have to come to a come to a place of full realization I just pray see God's got anchored in our hearts I mean we're part of his word hallelujah we're not just here to you know stumble into this message religion and go you know go through this church order and and and go through the motions no no this message has called you because you're part of his word you are the manifestation of the Bible in this day earlier but the the day's got a door in our lives the lights are going to come on then you bell see where you're standing who you are what he's made you to be hallelujah amen so then so but then shall I know even as also I am known now I believe that will be in this time not over in glory I believe it'll be in this time I mean because there has to come a time where our our emotions become secondary to the Word of God that is not our spirit realm guiding us now I'm very much preaching to myself when I say this it's not our emotions dictating how we treat others and how we speak and you know it's not our it's not our spirit realm driving us but it is our soul it's a word on the inside of the inside I mean it's got to come a time when that actually has control over our spirit realm now that doesn't mean we become robots and we don't have no feelings no that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that that our emotions won't drive us you know people get moody because their emotions drive then now we are we will never be totally immune or be able to escape our emotional realm you take you my spirit out of me I'm dead I'm gonna be alive I believe until my body's changed so I always have that human realm in me imagination conscious of fictions reasonings of fictions and I think I said that twice and there's always when I can't remember my card go do some homework you'll see what the spirit realm consists of but you know that will always be part of you but there has to come a time when the word actually takes that spirit realm under subjection and this is not just your flesh under subjection to the Word of God but your spirit realm comes under sin you know subject to the Word of God so and I believe that that as we look into the scripture and see as God comes along you read the Bible and God says that's you whoever found that I mean I'm with Joshua round round round Jericho I saw myself there I saw myself as Rahab Holly I saw myself as Ruth or ester or David's mighty mean whoever it may be I saw myself there I saw myself as David killing Goliath hallelujah I saw myself Peter James and John a man I saw myself there what why is that is that your imagination or God's is that you Holly that's you and they so what does that do now that may give you a stability in life I mean what's happening the word is being birth in you right and because if you can see yourself as a believer but when the devil comes along and says you're not a believer is that going to shake you know cuz you got that word of stabilizing you right hallelujah so you know we shall know as we are known and this is where we're living today I believe we need to know as we are known and say Lord member brother Brahim said in the church age book Revelation is more powerful than anything it's the most important thing pray for revelation more than anything else that's what we're gonna do Lord and it doesn't matter what age we are you say Lord reveal yourself to me reveal you who I am in you that's what we should be praying for more than more than anything else in this world Lord make make who I am in you known to me because if the scripture says then I shall know even as I am known hallelujah therefore it's gonna happen so why delay it say Lord tell me about myself I wanna know who I am and you you know the Lord wants us to know who we are in him because it manifests his victory over the devil hallelujah well how does it manifest as victory when God comes you and says yo you're perfect yeah your sins are all washed away more than just a partial understanding yes I know the blood doesn't know but when he comes to you and says I've taken your guilt I've taken your shame I've taken your frustrations I've taken you know I've taken all your guilt your past I've taken everything and anything that can be held against you and I took it that day on Calvary holy and the devil cannot hold it against you no more he has no legal right against the believer to hold any such thing against against the believer get how wonderful that is when actually says you came out of me you're not you know you are one of my attributes upon the earth Allu you what does it do down they actually glorifies him it doesn't make us a bunch of stuffed shirts no it actually just makes us more humble and yelled at Lord yeah you're the Prophet sees in one place is if the bride really really knew what he did she'd be on her knees day and night crying out if we really could just you know realize the magnitude of of being you know escaping this world having an exit door hallelujah you know the plane is you're on fire you know this world is free-falling it's on fire it's going but there's an exit door howler there's a way to get out easy has come this way you're not part of the damage Oh hallelujah you're going up to the wedding so but you know the magnitude you know if that could really just anchor down in our hearts you know you will be on streets of gold there's no there's therefore no condemnation then mature in Christ let's walk after the spirit there's no condemnation you think about the magnitude of those words I'm free from the fear of tomorrow I'm free from the guilt of my past for I've traded these shackles for a glorious song I'm free praise the Lord free at last you know incredible is but it's going to become a perfect realization not just a partial one because of its partial this human understanding with it but where it comes complete there's no human understanding it's only what God tells you about it hallelujah now it says in the masterpiece message he says Christ came the masterpiece to fulfill that speaking of the Old Testament he was the masterpiece of the Old Testament right brother Brahim said when when Adam and Eve from the garden that was God's masterpiece but then son came in and marred the masterpiece but God wasn't willing to be defeated he begin to rebuild hallelujah our God will never be defeated Amen he'll never lose holler he can't lose Amen so then he begin to rebuild and he was rebuilding the man all the way down through that's why you see Christ and Moses Christ and Jacob Christ and you know Isaac Christ and David Christ and Solomon you see Christ through the prophets that was God rebuilding until all that was in the old test was now the fullness of God it boldly was in him Holle though the entire word and the new test was in him but then he says now he says now this bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament you got a word to fulfill I mean you know many times is like sometimes you know if you work in a job long enough sometimes you gotta go back and look at your job description what was I actually employed for yeah because sometimes the boss can try and get you do all these other car things you gotta hold on what a mic see here you know there's this one guy there's this one guy you know work he was he was employed to do research and development a scientist but he's doing my job with me that's not what he's employed for so you know and that's just circumstances that's Raymond you all know you know but you know he you know sometimes you gotta read your job description and it's actually no I wasn't employed to just do monkey work on the bench I was you know I said you know I was telling the youth here you know the Lord the last thing the Lord dealt with me was was I was worshiping my education I so caught up in it nothing wrong with education but don't need to become your everything it was my everything and the Lord said you worshiping your education and before I met the Lord I said I never want to be a lab monkey you know just a rout routine testing and Here I am being a lab monkey doing routine testing you know God's gonna never say never you know but the job description I happens to be a lab monkey his Raymond's job description is to be a research and development scientist but he's doing my job what with me cuz we're short-staffed anyway that's a whole nother thing and it's all good but you know but sometimes we've got to go and read our job description as I said now the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament why are you here now we know we're not employed like a job does actually we're here to fulfill we are the Word of God manifested by bigger looking now Lord what am i here to fulfill amen and if I'm here to fulfill it remember a good boss will enable their workers to do their job you know they will never penalize the employees for not doing the job if they don't have the tools you know it's like just like an electricians got to go fix a big transformer or something or you know do some big thing and he's got no tools the bosses go fix that and he goes the electricity says I can't do it and the boss comes on gets angry why didn't you fix this thing now now the employee should say well he never gave me the tools to do the job I don't have the tools to do it now God does not like that he's the best boss he's our King he's our husband right so he fully equipped us amen to do the job we're here to do hallelujah so now so we got to look into the scripture you gotta look at everything but here's a way yeah I like highlights we can dig down deeper you know we're here to take a rapture we're here that there's a generation upon the earth that will not see death and I believe I'm looking at part of it you got to say Lord I'm here to take a body change I mean there's a life your life is coming for me to change these atoms hallelujah so we're here we're here to take a rapture now humanly can anyone change dimensions it's not you to try and change dimensions he's fully equipped you to change dimensions and then when the Word of God was manifest he becomes living in your soul you are equipped to take a body change the rapture is already in you it's laying there a man is coming more alive more alive more real more real oh yeah but we're equipped to take a rapture remember he's the best boss he gives us all the tools we need and he actually comes in us and does the job anyway talk about micro medicine but it's the best kind of micro management you know cuz he comes and he becomes the Christian and you hallelujah remember he never put something on you without you giving the ability to do it hallelujah you know you just look at the devil being under our feet part of the job description he's equipped us to do it there my name you shall cast out Devils hallelujah and then the job description is also to bring this subject to the Word of God amen it's in there he gives us the ability to do it that's why the Apostle Paul says I die daily it's no longer I that liveth but Christ lives in me I'll just give you those three but go look at your job description I mean that eternal life would be imparted to other people hallelujah salvation will come to others I mean every every joint supplies every part of the body is as vital right amen now now the bride now has bride so I will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpieces and making remember we shall know as we are known you may you may look at yourself and say me a masterpiece I'm more like a Picasso who knows what Picasa modern art you know you know we I've been to modern art museums and they need like two paragraphs to describe a dot on a bit of canvas what this actually means you know we're not that kind of masterpiece you see the word made flesh that's the masterpiece right so so another masterpieces and making and so you've got to look at yourself and say actually I am God's masterpiece amen you say that's awful proud no no what if he's made me to be thus this is what I am I mean you know just like if animals could speak a dog would say I'm a dog what do you do I do dog things you know or a lion I'm a lion you know he doesn't need to be proud about he's just the lion he's built to be a certain way he's the top of the food chain he conducts himself a certain way hyena is a different kind of way they they they they do different kind of things as the hyenas a lion is not a hyena a hyenas not a lion we take a vulture everything has its because it's built a certain way it operates as it's built but humans are not that way humans without the birth new birth do not conduct themselves like sons and daughters of the king right but once you meet him I mean then you should operate as you're built hallelujah you understand I mean so so we are God's masterpiece well what so how we how we built then Adam and Eve had dominion over the earth right the blood of Jesus Christ has come cleans the people Satan is being dethroned and the bride is coming to her position right that means we have power to speak storms out of existence we know the master of the wind we know the maker of the rain I mean when the devil comes and troubles us in our minds we're right to cast them out I mean we have a right to where we find them kick them out but I put up with them don't just leave him there no get rid of them that's why Joshua God told Joshua wipe them all out don't leave one in there you know that's not their land that's not their inheritance drive them all out kill them all destroy them don't let them ever grow again get rid of them same thing with spirits that come against us don't entertain it don't put up with it you know you ought to think about how you even think I mean because our thought patterns will bring us into a certain atmosphere right but you've got to remember you can't stop thoughts starting but you can stop them growing right but it's up to you to be you're gonna be a good gardener and your own in your own mind me my God gave you Dominion you know I was thinking you know this we call yo this is the battlefield that God chose well God actually said no no you can fight and he devil I'll allow you now the victor in a battle that's more powerful chooses the battlefield you take you take great victories in history it was the victor that chose the battlefield you take even even the British in the hundred year war the English when they're fighting the French and there's the Battle of Agincourt and different ones they actually picked the battlefield you miracle II though well outnumbered but they set the battlefield and they they they defeated a far more well-equipped French army so God said this is the battlefield right but remember the devil only works in here but God dwells in the soul so so now the devil can't go to where goddess but now that God can go up to where the devil tries to to live I mean so now we have reinforcements constantly coming through hallelujah so now when the devil tries to put a foot on the beach amen here's the heavy artillery nuclear bombers would blow them out of the water with the word of God hallelujah amen why are you saying that no but you but it's up to you what do you allow here see people people who are depressed right they start with a dose a depressed yes I see depressed those who are depressed they have a a very bad sad outlook on life right I'm no good I'm worthless I failed again I'll never get this right and it starts a a thought pattern which creates an atmosphere right or people who are actually successful they said no I can do this I believe no hey it didn't work this time but I'm gonna try again amen oh the devil got me there but I'm gonna get him I fell over here tripping up here but I'm gonna win the Bible says I'm gonna win I'm more than a conqueror through Christ that first love me I'm gonna win probably I can do the same in God's name we're to do it he pushes my salvation I'm gonna take a rapture that's not being depressed that's actually and it's more than the power of positive thinking because of the man thinketh in his heart so is he right so if you think of yourself as being worthless and useless and dumb and stupid and you'll never met some image in the world then that doesn't build any good kind of self-confidence because I know no Lord I know who I am but what Jesus says I am I Know Who I am right so you got a watch but then thing is you can be broken now that the of thought pattern but then it'll try and come back again because I remember he said you can't stop thoughts coming but you can cut them off Amen or even not trusting someone or being jealous of someone or whatever you know being envious of what other people have that starts with the thought there we'll try and see us think this basically yes plants and watch what's happened you know that's why we've got to be in can be content with what God made us to be amen and if we knows we are knowing hallelujah I'm part of his body upon the earth I'm going in a rapture haha fear amen amen so we're a masterpiece and other masterpieces and making has it taken him four thousand years to make this masterpiece speaking of Christ now he's been nearly two thousand years making another masterpiece a bride for Christ another masterpiece hello masterpiece of God how are you and he also preached another sermon the identified masterpiece of God and well how am I the identified masterpiece God comes and says this is you he quickens this message to you he's actually identifying you are my masterpiece I remember we sure knows we're knowing if God looks down says this is my masterpiece upon the earth we need to think of ourselves Lord I'm your workmanship you have a perfect image of me in your mind and you're crafting it well you're molding me shape me sanding bits off getting the chisel and the hammer and doing all kinds of but you're working that's why we need to see the value of our everyday life and God working in our everyday life amen there's great value say well the Monday to Friday drag yeah God's working in the Monday to Friday drag you've got to look from in that Monday to Friday drag I mean when you go to school you sit there mess comes or whatever are another math lesson God's working in there math lesson or I've got to do this I do some ordering at work or do this thing you know a lot of stuff that we do at work is repetitive if it wasn't you'd have kind of a cool job maybe you know but a lot of us just just repetitive but God wants to use that every day repetitive life to train and mold and shape you but you need to look for a look from in everyday circumstances amen and so doing it he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpieces word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because it can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's the perfect word any dirt trash injections it'll break but the heaven and heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never break you remember and cutting of diamonds you have to have a perfect tool to do it worth not just any piece we'll do it I've seen tons of them of them big grinders crashed right through it and move them big tonnes over and pass that diamond right on through no it don't break the diamond it has to be cut now he's doing the same thing in his never changing method we find out a Malachi three he said I'm God and I changed not he cannot change his method amen his word comes and cuts us shapes us into his image now brother Bram says here and so this is from the latest in church age he says now he is the true witnesses from revelations chapter 3 he is the true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back here in revelations three seven and I'll come to that later you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast to false it has a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization and contrast to partial realization now back in the Philadelphian age the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words in first Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with them we with them we rejoice also we haven't seen them but we have felt them we know him now as much as our limiting senses can tell us but one day we'll be face to face for that is for this age he says he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will we make perfect realization completed realization hallelujah we've been looking through a glass darkly but soon we'll be face to face we have been we have been going from glory to glory but soon we'll be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like and Wonder they like of Jesus our Savior divine isn't that wonderful we are completing him that is true he would not lie to us about that amen but one day will be changed and the atoms will put on immortality will will all be swallowed up in life then we will realize realization just as as brother um Paul was preaching and you know when day on Wednesday about faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so now when God gives you faith it's actually it's the evidence of things not seen so it's the proof of things you do not see evidence is proof so now when you were when we have received faith I mean a revelation from God that we're going in a rapture it is actually the proof the evidence we are going in the rapture right hallelujah with when he reveals you that you have salvation by the blood of Jesus Christ amen is proof or evidence that you have it and because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen I'll listen now now so here we are living in this age where we're going from partial realization to complete realization now the Apostle Paul would speak about death being swallowed up in victory will be swallow up in life in 1st Corinthians 15 and he says in verse 50 now I say this brethren that flesh and blood cannot in here at the kingdom of God neither does corruption and here at interruption but behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this in crafts all must for this corrupt rule rather must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory how this is o death where as I sting o grave where is thy victory this thing of death and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren because of this my beloved my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as he know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I mean so because you know you're the reason I see it therefore is because therefore be means because of this for I've just said I mean that that death death has no stress sting grave has no victory I mean but this crop dog will put on incorruption I mean death will be swallowed up in victory because of these things be steadfast be are movable amen always abounding in the work of the Lord because it's not in vain I mean now I went to go see where because as the Apostle Paul said adders as it is written death is swallowed up I mean so it shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory so I went to see where that was from and that was from Isaiah 25 and eight he says he will swallow up death and victory and the Lord will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the Lord has spoken it and it shall be sitting that day lo this is our God we have waited for him who's waiting for him to come I mean it take us away in a body change hey man who's who's waiting to meet him in the air I mean lo this is our God we have waited for him he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him and we will be glad and rejoice in her salvation Holly you know I always thinking I might be wrong but when the dead in Christ rise you know we should really say we've been expecting you hallelujah we've been waiting for you to come amen and then any when we meet the Lord in the air say Lord we've been waiting for you hallelujah I mean so death will be swallowed up in victory now this will come I believe when we come to a complete realization that nothing can hold us here Alleluia now brother Brahim season God hiding in simplicity he says he says that's the little lady standing sorry sorry is calling someone out with a chicken like thing on something just struck her a few minutes ago and she raised her hands up that's right lady just right here with her hands up here behind the lady with the blue dress on there it is see well see I'm looking right at it now if I've ever told you anything wrong tell me when it's here friends you've got to get away from that statue Pentecostal way you've really got to die you've got to really mean it you've got something you've got a partial hunger but not a real hunger see it's partial it's got to be a complete hunger it's got to be a real hunger you've got to make it genuine see we're going to have a real hunger this world is engineered that we do not hunger no more right that's the problem with this country is we have no lack we have too much right we have too much I mean we don't lack nothing a man if I lose my job I can go to winds you know this everything is the way something to support me which is a good thing I don't say it's a bad thing I'm not talking politics now but but remember we're rich increased with Goods have need of nothing that is the lady och we live in you say but I'm part of the bride but it'll still try and affect you right so we can't just let a hunger be a partial hunger we got ever real hunger Lord it's your parish I must have you must have more of your honesty you live in my family wanna see you living my children I mean not out of my own ability but Lord give me a real hunger for more of you amen I'll only be satisfied when my body has changed oh you know I'm not trying to work I'm not trying about to talk about working up a hunger I say don't let nothing get that hunger out of you that's what I'm saying I mean don't just let it be a partial hunger and get and get distracted by something else there Lord you've given me this hunger for a reason there's a deep calling to the deep I mean the reason he put a hunger and a hunger in your heart is because he wants to he's got Saint to fulfill that hunger yeah brother Brown says that there's actually God chooses how close people live to him it's not man's choosing it wasn't our choosing to be the Bride of Christ that was his choosing I mean so there's a predestinate place by him for his bride and the reason he gives you the Hungry's is there's a place by me like he said the Moses God would walk past him he says show me your glory Moses walked past misses the backs favor man God says but there's a place by me stand here Moses hallelujah and it's more so for the bride there's a place by him and he wants you to stand there he's paved the way for you to stand there hallelujah and we should know and if he's called you to stand in that place I say Lord remove all distractions you do it not me trying to remove it say Lord take that hunger and just magnify it in my life amen you've got to make it genuine while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard it try closing your eyes bowing your head think it over as it is there's something wrong Lord take away my unbelief now here with mortal eyes the angel the Lord whose pictures among us being taken by a scientific proof the same pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel that was Jesus when he had died buried and ascended back to God Saul on his road to Damascus was struck down by that same pillar of fire said Lord who are you says I'm Jesus jesus said I have come from God and went to God here he is today the same Jesus seen among us with our eyes caught by a camera manifested in the spirit oh brother sister what more can God do the hour of grace hallelujah now he sees us in the church age book there's a Philadelphian Anji sees now in the six age and the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still revelation 22 11 the be power verse he says I'm so glad that my holiness is not of myself I am glad that I'm in Christ now this is now a complete realization he says I'm so glad that my holiness is not of myself I am glad that I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yea imparted unto me blessed be God forever he says these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true and just in the sense that opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization to an idea to an idea as contrasted with its partial realization for example we recall that jesus said in john 632 moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father have giveth you the true bread from heaven john 15 and 1 i am the true vine hebrews 9 24 for christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us first John 2 and 8 because darkness has passed and the true light now shine a--the since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as again as against the idea of partial realization as illustrated in these verses we can now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance was shadow take example now the manna from heaven God sent down angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day effort was um if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from heaven where if manna was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came down from heaven he'll never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need any longer for partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't part of God He is God no one could deny that G that Israel had light they were the only people that had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that no one I mean that that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites there was light but now true light has come the light of the world as Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word was now broken forth in the brightness of God manifested among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that wonderful and that was wonderful now light and life were manifested and the fullness of the Godhead bodily so so now we see there's a great contrast between the shadow and the reality I mean and now even though you know even we look into this day you know we look into the Old Testament so much but it was just a shadow but now we have the reality where where Moses could stand on the under the blood of bulls and gods and says let there be frogs and flies and and you know whatever plague it was he was a man under the blood of bulls and ghosts but what about those under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean that are anointed to speak amen that that their people will go free now there's a far greater contrast I mean between Moses position and your position I mean when Jesus would speak of John the Baptist he'd say he was the greatest prophet of the Old Testament right but but he is the least in the kingdom of God now why is that because now under the blood of bulls and goats that the church could only come to a certain position right and then and then John the Baptist was the bridge between the older than you so now those under the blood of Jesus Christ are a higher order than even the Old Testament prophets hallelujah SAR now heed they were just under the blood of bulls and goats that was the shadow but now we're in the reality form a Mesa now that was partial realization this is a partial understanding what the blood can do but now we have the full realization of what the blood can do I mean where with a blood of Jesus Christ can come upon a person and change their nature I mean that's not them living no more it's God living in human flesh again hallelujah I mean now we have now we have reality I mean we don't just talk about this you know that's why I read that quote from Shalom God is appearing among us I mean now to me that's not back in 1964 that's in 2020 hallelujah that God is appearing among us I mean that we are not know we're not historian saying well God lived 50 years ago 60 years ago that same God is here today I mean to do the same kind of things I'm in hallelujah now you take you take the tour on the way to Emmaus brother Han says that Luke chapter 24 is modern events are made clear by prophecy any any reads Luke 24 the tour on the way to Emmaus so you're saying that that is a prophecy of today and so here they are walk long they have a partial and partial realization when you heal as a prophet he was a great man you know yeah you know that you're there talking to the one that they're calling was a prophet and we believe he'd deliver us from you know different things they had a partial realization of who he was but now the Lord comes himself and walks with them opening the scripture to them and it's going from a partial realization to a full realization right so here they are they have a partial understanding we believe he is going to be the Messiah let's just go this shall we this got to Luke 24 now let's go to let's go to verse 17 although there's go from verse 16 but their eyes were Holden I so let's go above Jesus himself drew near and went with them so here now the resurrected Messiah is going with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and I said so why you said why are you talking about these things and he's the one who's resurrected from the grave and one of them whose name was Clare first answering said unto Him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said unto them what things he's the reason for all these events he's saying what's going on see sometimes the law can walk with us and he can actually withhold himself that we don't feel him that recognizes him but remember that on the way to Emmaus had to be in the upper room they were part of the resurrection that's the whole reason the Lord walked with them because they were part of the resurrection also right Jesus is because I live you shall live also and they once didn't respond since were made alive when the Holy Ghost came into them they were part of the word yep and it's the same thing with us right the Lord walks with us amen because we are part we are the rapture okay let's just keep reading now and one of them whose name is Clovis answering said are you I'm only a stranger in Jerusalem it has not known the things which I come to pass here in these days and he said under them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus admit of of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him but we trusted that it had been him that should have redeemed Israel and besides all of us that today is the third day since these things were done yeah in certain woman also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not as body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which said he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so but they said but him they saw not so they had hopes from there to partial realization but now the Lord is working with them you're not going to stay with the partial realization I'm gonna give you a complete one this is why he went with them and he opened the word he opened the scripture to them it's the same thing with us we had a partial realization we had a partial understanding right you have a partial understanding of what the message is about and different doctrines and different things but it goes from a partial understanding to a complete complete understanding a complete realization amen so now here they go there they're walking with them he opens the word to them then finally they come you know you know you know they come into the village of Emmaus and they can you know he's about to walk on low stay with us stay with us they sit down they break bread and as the head of the table breaks the bread so he sat down to hit a table broke the bread then their eyes came open and they had a full realization a perfect realization that's the very resurrected one we're talking about us now with us and they said to him I mean they see to each other didn't our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way say even under a partial realization their hearts were burning when he opened the scripture and began to identify himself all the way down through the scripture and then he did something he did before he was crucified he broke the bread and because he did something he did before he was crucified their eyes came open that's him he's alive hallelujah and it's now the same thing with us the Lord comes we are we are caught up the world's falling apart their will fell apart yeah it's amazing brother Brahim says that this is modern ovens made clear by prophecy he doesn't focus on what everyone else is doing he focuses on his walk with his bride I mean that is the main event going on don't be caught up in global politics it'll do what it will do be caught up in the revelation of the word amen focus on that because that's your portion to fulfill I mean Trump will be Trump Putin will be Putin whoever will be whoever they'll do their thing but the bride will be the bride I mean you have to be focused be caught up don't be caught up with the news amen be caught up and what God wants to do with you that's why this message became a reality it became more than a voice you heard voice behind the voice God speaking and gripped you like nothing else gripped you that's why I believe you'll hear I mean why because he's walking with this is I'm gonna give you a complete realization I'll do that you're not just a partial on this thing how's this gonna work am I really gonna make it did he really die for me or all my son am I really forgiven he's I don't know no purpose you know it's like purpose in his friend he was determined I'm not gonna leave them with this doubt what's going on what's my state of being where am i what's happening today see he doesn't want you to just be walking along life's journey saying am I really gonna make it am I really forgiven did he really take my guilt did he really take my shame am I really gonna go on a body change am I really gonna overcome he doesn't want us to have those questions he wants us to that's why he walks with you seems like I'll show you here this is who you are this is the shadow I remember the type if the shadow did it the reality will do it in a far greater measure amen and so sorry sure this is you here you Joshua you're Caleb you'll get the mountain just keep walking amen you Abraham or you're Sarah oh I doubt it one spot I'm Sarah did too but then she had her own visitation and she wasn't down to no more she judged him faithful that he was able to do that which he had promised we're gonna come to a place where we judged him faithful amen and he takes you through the scripture this is you and as you as David does you're Solomon whoever it may be and why what's happening because he's wondering get you understand and then he takes you through Peters life you're Peter glory to God Peter goes through his great humiliation he stands here one day I'll never deny you Lord I'll die with you take just saw it try it kills a girl be the big hero of the story I ends up ends up buckling under the pressure of you know you know woman because in those days woman was seeing class citizens and those Ralphs of God since these woman then I knew one of his disciples at her he back always this big man he buckles under the pressure and swears and denies and whatever more and he's honors their sheep thinking oh man I've failed and even the Lord looks at him he's walking out and he realizes what what Jesus said here do he did because was God knows how to get us down to a place but it never ever stopped Peter being Peter on the day of pentecost amen so now the Lord knows how to get us to a point and you can see yourself in Peters life because here's Peter he denied the Lord he wept bitterly when he realized what he had just done and that and in the hour when the Lord needed him the most he rejected him he denied him he cursed doing it but then went after the Lord resurrection el and no doubt who's been there Peter you know the woman come back the tomb is empty here we took the spices we didn't need the spices the stones rolled away all the guards were gone the seal was broken hallelujah we looked in there to angel there's angels in the term saying he's not here he's risen we've come back to tell you and then Mary comes in a bit later I saw him hallelujah I didn't go on the tomb but I was there I was so down and then I heard a voice from behind me saying woman why are you weeping I turn around thought he was a gardener I think he tell me we've taken him I'll carry him away and he called me by name Holly he's arisen but you're Peter he's alive what's gonna happen winner winning when I face him hallelujah and his Peter with this heaviness and then they're fishing and then they hear a call from the sea yo see sure children you godly meet and then he's like no I be fishing all night and then John actually looks and says Peter Peter it's the Lord now Peter doesn't know how he's going to be received he's failed he's bitterly utterly failed member for Jesus died they had a big dispute among themselves who's gonna be the greatest and maybe Peter cuz he you know he's the one who jumped out on the walked on the water he did although thou art the Christ son living God is always the first you know well I'll show you you know I'll be the greatest soul defend him and his great time of need you'll fell apart the Lord's on the on the seashore and he thinks to himself he doesn't know how he's going to be received but something intimacies I must get to Jesus hallelujah I must get to him he jumps and swims there hallelujah bread and fish upon the fire and the Lord looks and says Peter do you love me I love you Lord feed my sheep Lord do you love me you lord i love you feed my lambs Peter do you love me Lord you know I love you howling who's been there amen remember it doesn't stop what God has ordained you to be we fail and then we leave that then did we use that as a big question mark against us well that happened member Peter was a believer he had the revelation thou art the Christ the Son of God he wasn't a Pharisee he wasn't a make-believe like Judas he is a real believer but he fouled miserably now God wanted him to know he didn't want him to have a partial realization he wanted him to have a complete realization you've been washed in my blood you're a new creature and me I don't hold those things against you sure you did those things and it's in the scripture mention reading that mention being Peter and reading it you know you sit around you get the scroll out you know you you read that about yourself in the Bible you know if Allah has written down there be a lot of spots we wouldn't be proud about I mean we'd say please don't write that don't record that there'd be a lot of spots right but but the blood of Jesus Christ does such a cleansing work I mean it God didn't remember it no more I found it's not held against you no more he does remember in his records it's gone hallelujah and he wants you to recognize that that when you go to praise God and say I'm a believer the devil can't say oh but what about this what about with the brothers he said devil my God took care of it I've been cleans I've been sealed I being redeemed holy and not just a hope so I know so hallelujah he wants us to know that we know that we know that we know I mean when God came to know said build an ark he had such confidence we're gonna build this Ark doesn't matter what voice came against him what kind of criticism he's like no we're building this maybe your son said daddy sure this is the way this is the way God called me you have confidence God called me God called me by this message wasn't me that called me wasn't someone else God called me that's why I'm a believer and the reason he called you is because he took care of your sin your shame your first birth whatever it may be God washed it away hallelujah well I say that say Lord anchored down to my soul God took care of my past Jesus drop the charges however you want to say it it's been taken care of it's no longer a partial realization that's got to be a complete this hour fail every day just get back up get back up remember when when when Joshua lost the Battle of AI we don't think about that one but they didn't just quit and leave the land and go back to Egypt they said Lord what do we need to do what's going on God showed them they continued on it should be the same thing you've miserably failed Lord search my heart did any wicked way and me cleans me try me pick me up let's keep going now he says then I'll just finish this finish with this rather but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice perfect sacrifice the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect but once God's ordained method I mean it was once God's ordained method rather but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews could not take that but what about that Philadelphia Aegeus and other ages - did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir even though the Luther brought out the truth of justification the the Romish church and its eastern counterpart the orthodox church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect that's Christ or parish and it there's not even Christ and works it's Christ alone this age began the years of Arminianism that does not believe that that in Christ as the reality it does not sing nothing but the for it sings nothing but the blood a my own conduct now I believe in good conduct if you are saved you'll do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it as Jesus alone I'm reading from the church age book of your wandering salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word of my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heals me let it be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen I feel I could just go on about these truths but I'll give you one more thought it's about that wonderful hymn that a B Simpson wrote once it was a blessing now is the Lord once it was the feeling now it is his word once his gift I wanted now the giver one once I sought for healing now himself alone all in all for ever Jesus will I sing everything in Jesus and Jesus everything there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in Christ everything fades in into insignificance besides him I'll leave it there amen god bless you friends we have the musicians please I'll get the Joshua maybe next week amen but it's gotta be let him let him establish it in your heart amen it's not maybe I'll get thee so Lord show to me the power of your salvation the reality of it there's not me wondering if I'm going to get there Lord show it to me Lord the power of at the power of his blood I mean that's Dan shall we maybe let's just sing that shall we nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again oh this thing that song you chose me he chose me I didn't choose me he chose me and if he chose me he chose me hallelujah that's very simple but you know I think we can worship the Lord amen were sorry who can drive oh were it not for thy nail-scarred and nail start and for knee bands were if not fall I love for me
