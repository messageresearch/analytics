[6:20] Good Morning.
[6:22] How are you this morning?
[6:26] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[6:30] [Music]
[6:32] It's good to be here. It's good to um
[6:37] it's good to have an opportunity to to
[6:40] praise the Lord and also to show the
[6:43] rocks
[6:44] and the seats
[6:46] and the mountains and the rivers that
[6:48] the Lord means more to us than what he
[6:50] means to them.
[6:53] You know, because when when when the
[6:55] when when Jesus was going into
[6:57] Jerusalem, when the people were praising
[6:58] him and the the some some of the critics
[7:02] told Jesus, "Oh, you should stop the
[7:03] people from praising and worshiping."
[7:05] And he said, "If they don't praise me,
[7:07] the rocks will cry out."
[7:10] But I believe that all of us here this
[7:12] morning have had more of an experience
[7:13] of to know the Lord and his goodness
[7:15] than what a rock has. All a rock's ever
[7:18] happened to it is it's been made and sat
[7:20] there. But but it's never had a chance
[7:23] to respond or be formed or changed like
[7:25] a rock is a rock. But we've had the
[7:27] chance to be changed, to be renewed, to
[7:29] be formed, to be to experience the
[7:31] spirit of God more than a rock has. So
[7:35] it's a good day to be alive. It's a good
[7:36] day to worship the Lord. So let's stand
[7:38] this morning and let's just praise.
[7:39] Let's worship. Let's let's enter enter
[7:41] into his courts with thanksgiving and
[7:44] just be under great expectation this
[7:46] morning that the spirit of God's going
[7:47] to move amongst us and in your own life
[7:49] in a powerful way. If you've got
[7:50] questions, you're going to be answered.
[7:52] If you've got things you need, the
[7:53] Lord's going to meet you in whichever
[7:54] way in the way that he knows how to meet
[7:56] you and that you know how he meets you.
[7:59] And we're under expectation to hear the
[8:01] word of God this morning. You know, the
[8:03] more we pull and the more we draw on it,
[8:06] the more it ministers to us. Cuz brother
[8:09] um Ben is an anointed minister. He
[8:12] doesn't just come up here and read off a
[8:15] bunch of notes, you know. You you you
[8:16] watch some sermons like an Anglican. Now
[8:19] and then I just watch other random
[8:21] sermons, you know, and it's a it's look,
[8:23] these guys are all right, but they you
[8:25] know, they just he sort of just gets up
[8:26] there and reads word for word what he's
[8:28] written in his notes. You know, that
[8:29] would be so boring. Would you find that
[8:32] boring?
[8:35] We've got a minister that's inspired,
[8:36] that can be led by the spirit of God.
[8:38] That's it's a dynamic situation
[8:40] happening. You can be pulling and
[8:42] wanting, desiring something, and the
[8:43] spirit of God works and speaks it. You
[8:45] know, that's that's that's who we come
[8:47] to. That's what we've got this morning.
[8:48] So, let's just um open in prayer. Lord,
[8:50] we thank you that we can be here this
[8:51] morning, Lord, and we can experience the
[8:53] Holy Ghost, Lord. Experience the
[8:54] dynamic, the supernatural this morning.
[8:56] We know we serve a supernatural God,
[9:00] Lord, and that you can move in each
[9:01] heart this morning, Lord. And we just
[9:03] pray you um we just want to invite you
[9:06] into our midst, Lord, that you'd just
[9:07] bless us this morning by your spirit,
[9:08] Lord. Forgive us of every sin, Lord. And
[9:10] we just come to your we come boldly
[9:12] before your throne of grace this
[9:13] morning, Lord, knowing that you told us
[9:15] to come. So, we just want to commit the
[9:16] service to your hands. Just bless us in
[9:17] a powerful way. We ask in Jesus
[9:19] wonderful name. Amen. Let's start with

[13:23] Is it you or do we look for another?
[13:28] I can hear John say.
[13:31] [Music]
[13:33] His eagle eyes were getting clouded
[13:36] over.
[13:38] Seemed to have lost his way.
[13:42] [Music]
[13:43] John's disciples
[13:45] went to Jesus,
[13:48] told him all that John had said.
[13:53] Jesus sent them with the message. And
[13:58] this is what he said.
[14:02] Go tell John that the lame they walk. Go
[14:08] tell John that the blind they see.
[14:12] Go tell John that the dead are raised.
[14:17] The captives they have all been granted
[14:20] liberty.
[14:21] [Music]
[14:22] Go tell John. When my prophet speaks,
[14:27] believe it, receive it in your heart.
[14:31] You don't have to understand it. It
[14:35] stands all alone. And I'll interpret it
[14:38] by bringing it to pass.
[14:41] [Applause]
[14:42] Is it him or do we look for another?
[14:47] I have heard some say,
[14:50] [Music]
[14:52] "Is this Elijah that Malachi spoke of?"
[14:57] Oh, we in Bible days.
[15:02] Search the scriptures
[15:04] Jesus taught us and there they testify
[15:08] of me.

[16:58] Where do I go
[17:01] when there's no one else to turn to? Who
[17:04] do I talk to?
[17:07] Oh, and no one wants to listen. Who do I
[17:11] lean on

[17:16] to the rock. I know he is able. I go to
[17:20] the rock.

[17:32] stands by me.
[17:34] For the earth all around me is sinking
[17:37] sand. On Christ, the solid rock I stand.
[17:41] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[17:43] friend, I go to the little.
[17:47] Where do I hide
[17:50] till the storms have all passed over?
[17:53] Where do I run to
[17:57] when the winds of sorrow threaten? Is
[18:00] there a refuge
[18:02] for the time of tribulation?
[18:06] When my soul needs a consolation, I go
[18:09] to the rock.
[18:12] I go to the rock of my salvation. I go
[18:16] to the stone that the build is rejected.
[18:18] I run to the mountain and the mountain

[19:28] Oh yes. When I need a shelter, when I
[19:31] need a friend, I go to the rock.
[19:38] [Music]
[20:13] The Assyrian army gathered around.
[20:17] Hezekiah walked up and looked around and
[20:21] all he saw as far as the eye could see
[20:24] was a sea of men.
[20:27] When the messengers
[20:29] came to him, he gave to them a ransom.
[20:34] But they said, "You have no more
[20:36] strength for war. Your counsel won't
[20:39] help you anymore."
[20:41] And all you people on the wall, hear
[20:45] what the great king says. Don't let
[20:49] Hezekiah deceive you. Your God won't
[20:53] deliver today.
[20:55] Just look at every place we've been and
[20:59] every kingdom that we fought has been
[21:02] trotten under our feet.
[21:06] You will be the same. And as the
[21:09] railings came up from the Assyrians,
[21:13] Hezekiah
[21:15] knelt down to his knees.
[21:19] He raised his hands and he bowed his
[21:22] head and said, "Oh God,
[21:28] today is a day of trouble.
[21:32] Oh God,
[21:35] the shout is come and there is no
[21:38] strength to bring forth.
[21:42] You're all my strength and you're all my
[21:45] deliverance
[21:49] and I'm putting my trust in you,
[21:53] oh God.
[21:56] Oh God,
[21:59] I have learned that every situation,
[22:05] whatever I am facing,
[22:09] I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put
[22:13] me to shame. Cuz I have learned that in
[22:18] every situation,
[22:21] whatever I am facing,
[22:24] I put my trust in Jesus
[22:28] and he won't put me to shame.
[22:35] Go tell Hezekiah
[22:38] that his prayer has been heard.
[22:41] Behold, I send Isaiah
[22:45] for faith, saith the Lord.
[22:48] To the king of Assyria, I say, who hast
[22:52] thou blasphemed against? Was it not to
[22:57] the holy one of Israel?
[23:01] You may have spoke to Hezekiah,
[23:05] but he put his trust in me.
[23:08] And the words that you have spoken, my
[23:12] ears they have received, but I'll hear
[23:15] no more.
[23:18] The way you came is the way you go. Your
[23:22] heels won't come against this city.
[23:25] You'll not fire one arrow.
[23:29] You'll not
[23:33] at all the Lord.
[23:38] You will turn and you will go. Thus say
[23:42] the Lord.
[23:44] Thus sayith the Lord.
[23:48] Cuz I have learned that in every
[23:51] situation,
[23:53] [Music]
[23:54] whatever I am facing,
[23:57] I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put
[24:01] me to shame. Cuz I have learned that in
[24:06] every situation,
[24:09] whatever I am facing,
[24:12] I put my trust in Jesus
[24:16] and he won't put me to chase. You're my
[24:21] shield. You're my shield and you're my
[24:24] buckler and your name is a strong tower.
[24:28] You're the shepherd of the valley of the
[24:33] shadow of death. And you prepare a table
[24:38] for me in the presence of my
[24:42] enemy.
[24:46] And you won't put me to shame.
[24:52] And when the morning sun arose,
[24:56] the air seemed so quiet.
[25:00] Here I looked out.
[25:03] Oh, what a sight.
[25:07] All over the fields
[25:10] right across the plains. The tents, they
[25:14] all seemed empty. There were no fires,
[25:18] no flames.
[25:20] The horses had no riders.
[25:23] The chariots the same.
[25:27] The dogs they had no masters. No Syrian
[25:32] remain.
[25:33] For the angel of the Lord went through
[25:38] the camp at night.
[25:41] So our mighty host
[25:44] and put the rest
[25:47] to fly. Cuz

[25:59] whatever I am facing,
[26:02] I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put
[26:06] me to shame. Cuz I have learned that in
[26:11] every situation,
[26:14] whatever I am facing,
[26:17] I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put
[26:22] me ashamed cuz I am that in every
[26:27] situation
[26:30] whatever I am facing
[26:33] I put my trust in Jesus
[26:36] and he won't put me to shame.
[26:43] Oh no, he won't put me
[26:47] to shame.
[26:53] [Music]
[27:03] [Music]
[27:08] Oh Lord, you search
[27:11] me.
[27:15] You know my way.

[40:47] Hallelujah. Um so there's no service on
[40:49] Wednesday, okay? And there's no service
[40:51] Wednesday after camp. So if you come
[40:54] here on Wednesday, no one will be here,
[40:56] okay? We're getting ready for camp. But
[40:58] yeah, so so just so you know. But yeah,
[41:00] it's going to be a wonderful time. We're
[41:01] all excited and it's going to be it's
[41:03] going to be tremendous. Now, let's just
[41:04] go to the scripture. Um this morning,
[41:06] we're going to go to Ezekiel chapter 22
[41:09] and then we're going to go to Jeremiah
[41:11] 49:11. We're going to read one verse
[41:13] there. Let's just go here and and um
[41:20] I mean, I trust everyone's well and
[41:23] happy in the Lord today. Amen. There's
[41:26] there's a few good. I trust by the end
[41:28] of today you'll be happy. Amen. Uh
[41:31] Ezekiel 22 and 27 says here this just
[41:34] continuing on from um part of what I
[41:38] read uh last uh last Sunday. And her
[41:41] princes uh in the midst thereof are like
[41:44] wolves ravening the prey to shed blood
[41:46] and to destroy souls to dis to get
[41:49] dishonest gain. and her prophets have
[41:51] dorbed them with untempted mortar,
[41:53] seeing vanity and divining lies uh unto
[41:56] them, saying, "Thus sayeth the Lord God,
[41:58] whom the uh when the Lord hath not
[42:00] spoken, the people of the land have used
[42:03] oppression and excise robbery, and have
[42:05] vexed the poor and needy, yay, they have
[42:07] oppressed the stranger wrongfully. And I
[42:09] sought for a man among them that should
[42:12] make up the hedge, and should stand in
[42:14] the gap before me for the land, that I
[42:16] should not destroy it, but I found none.
[42:19] Therefore have I poured out mine
[42:21] indignation upon them. I have consumed
[42:22] them with the fire of my wrath. Their
[42:25] own way have I recompensed upon their
[42:27] heads, saith the Lord God. Then Jeremiah
[42:31] 49 and and and 11. You can you can turn
[42:33] if you wish, but um
[42:36] Jeremiah wait 49 and1 sorry it's not 11.
[42:39] It's just it's actually verse one. Says
[42:41] here concerning the Ammonites, thus
[42:45] sayeth the Lord, hath Israel no sons?
[42:48] hath he no ear. Why then doth their king
[42:51] inherit Gad and his people dwell in his
[42:54] cities?
[42:56] Amen. I'm going to call this Listen
[42:58] today.
[43:01] Israel. So let's just pray actually.
[43:03] Okay, let's just pray. Sorry, I was
[43:05] Amen. Almighty God, we love you so much.
[43:07] Thank you, Lord. We can read your great
[43:09] eternal word, Lord. We need you, the
[43:10] great author, to come and inspire it to
[43:12] our lives, Lord. We desire to see you
[43:14] live more than anything, Lord, cuz truly
[43:16] you are awesome, Lord. You're almighty.
[43:17] You wish we had greater words to
[43:19] describe your majesty and power and
[43:20] mercy and grace, Lord. Father, we love
[43:22] you, Lord. Have your way in our midst
[43:24] this day, dear God. We just surrender
[43:26] our lives into your hands, Lord. Just
[43:28] desiring to see you live among us, Lord.
[43:30] And may you also touch those who
[43:31] couldn't be here today, Lord. We
[43:33] especially want to think of Sister
[43:34] Barbara, Lord, who's unwell in body. I
[43:36] pray you touch her, raise her up for
[43:37] your glory, Lord. Brother Phil as well,
[43:39] Lord. I'm not sure if he's here or not.
[43:40] I didn't see him, but Lord, I pray you'd
[43:41] be his portion, too, and heal him, Lord.
[43:44] anyone else who's away because of
[43:46] sickness, Lord, be with them. And
[43:47] Father, walk among us this day. Touch
[43:49] our lives, Lord. You're a personal God.
[43:51] Lord, we invite you to where we are for
[43:53] your glory. Have your way in Jesus
[43:55] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[43:57] you, friends. You can have your seats
[43:58] this morning. So, I want to I want to
[44:00] speak I want to look at this question
[44:02] because we're looking at, you know,
[44:04] we're approaching camp and I know uh the
[44:06] Christian walk is more than a special uh
[44:08] set of meetings on a campground, but you
[44:10] know, I just want to I just want to um
[44:12] I'd pray just just kind of get us into a
[44:14] a mode if that's okay. Ezekiel would
[44:19] would speak about how the Lord is
[44:22] seeking for a man to stand among them
[44:25] that they should uh that that that he
[44:27] should make up the hedge and stand in
[44:28] the gap before me in the land. So he's
[44:30] looking for a man and in that day he
[44:33] could not find a man. The Lord said I
[44:34] cannot find a man to stand in that gap
[44:36] to to to keep the ranks to to if there's
[44:39] any gap where the enemy can get in to
[44:41] fill that gap and to intercede for the
[44:43] people. And you know this is who God is
[44:45] looking for. And I now I believe when
[44:47] I'm speaking when I use the scripture
[44:49] here, I I I I don't just want to take it
[44:51] as a man, but I want to take it as sons
[44:53] and daughters of God. Amen. God is
[44:55] looking for his children to stand in
[44:57] their god- ordained position. Now, as we
[44:59] read here in Jeremiah, there's a
[45:01] question the Lord has asked. Has Israel
[45:03] no sons? Hath he no heir? Then why then
[45:07] do their king and Heragad and their
[45:09] people dwell in his city? So there's a
[45:11] question. Has, you know, why on earth is
[45:13] the enemy dwelling in God's possessions?
[45:15] You know, the people of God were meant
[45:17] to dwell in Gad. That was that was their
[45:19] inheritance. And you know, God was
[45:21] asking the question, does not does
[45:23] Israel have no sons? Does he have no men
[45:26] to stand up as sons and daughters of God
[45:28] to stand up and inherit their promises
[45:31] that God had given them? Has has there
[45:34] no one here that can receive the
[45:35] inheritance of the Lord? And I believe
[45:37] I'm looking at them this morning. You
[45:39] know, if I'm a bit halty and think,
[45:40] let's pray this just comes out okay. But
[45:42] you know, I'm believe I'm looking when
[45:44] God would ask if if God would ask this
[45:46] question today.
[45:48] Has has he has Jesus Christ no sons? Has
[45:52] he no sons and daughters? You know, and
[45:54] we can answer the question, yes, he
[45:55] does. Amen. We've been birthed by a
[45:57] word. Amen. We've been transformed by
[45:59] the message of the hour where God has
[46:01] revealed himself to us. Amen. To show us
[46:03] that we are sons and daughters of the
[46:05] most high God.
[46:07] Amen. So now the um the Ammonites were
[46:10] descended from the other daughter of Lot
[46:12] and Lot. Normally we just think of Moab
[46:14] and we think of Moab coming from Lot and
[46:16] the daughter. Well, from the other
[46:17] daughter came came these Ammonites. And
[46:19] so you know and they were they were so
[46:22] they were kind of related to Israel, but
[46:24] they weren't they weren't uh of the seed
[46:26] of Abraham. But you see they had they
[46:28] had no right to God's inheritance. But
[46:30] there was no one there were no there
[46:32] were no sons to stand up in that day and
[46:36] take back their inheritance. They were
[46:37] willing to let the enemy dwell in this
[46:40] position instead of actually taking
[46:42] their God-given rights and possessing
[46:44] what God had given them. And I believe
[46:46] that we're not willing this morning to
[46:48] let the enemy stand on any of our
[46:49] promises. Amen. To put any doubt on any
[46:51] word that God has given us. I believe
[46:53] that we're not just here to be dormant
[46:55] people, amen, that just just float along
[46:57] in life and say, "Yes, we believe the
[46:59] message and just quote it, but it
[47:00] doesn't live." I believe that I'm
[47:02] looking at sons and daughters of God.
[47:04] Amen. That are that are determined in
[47:06] their heart, Lord, I want you to live.
[47:08] Amen. Every promise you died for me on
[47:10] Calvary. I want to possess it. I want to
[47:12] enjoy it. I want to live in it. I want
[47:14] to walk in it. Amen. I don't I don't
[47:16] just want to talk about it. I want to
[47:17] see it live. Amen. And so that's why as
[47:19] a question goes out this morning, are
[47:21] there not any sons? I mean, not just
[47:23] males or females or girls or boys. I'm
[47:25] talking about sons and daughters of God.
[47:27] Amen. Who know who they are in this
[47:29] hour. I mean, they're not children. and
[47:31] and and an and adult bodies spiritually.
[47:33] No, but they're adults. Amen. Where they
[47:35] can take every promise of God. They're
[47:37] not willing just to be just to float
[47:38] along and go with the crowd, but they
[47:40] want to walk with God alone. Amen. Are
[47:42] there not any sons in this room? Amen.
[47:44] Or who's maybe listening that will
[47:46] actually not just live under a pity
[47:48] party wo is mentality and be a victim of
[47:50] circumstance, but actually be an
[47:52] overcomer. I mean, God has allotted a
[47:54] portion of overcoming to you. Amen. and
[47:56] he has placed in your life the ability
[47:58] to wrestle and overcome and pack out the
[48:01] victory. Amen. So this is why the
[48:03] question is here this morning. Why on
[48:05] earth is the enemy standing on our
[48:06] promises? Why on earth do we allow the
[48:08] enemy to stand on things and put in our
[48:10] minds it's not for you and you've done
[48:12] too wrong. You don't deserve this
[48:14] promise and you can't inherit it. You
[48:16] made too many mistakes and all this kind
[48:17] of nonsense. Why do we let those kind of
[48:20] religious ideas? Cuz remember the
[48:22] Ammonites were were you could say they
[48:24] were the the word twisted became wrong.
[48:28] Right? So it's that kind of spirit. Why
[48:30] do we allow that kind of spirit to rule
[48:32] our lives when God wants us to inherit
[48:34] all the promises
[48:37] now?
[48:38] I like to think, you know, why why is
[48:40] this Oh, wait. I got to go here, too. I
[48:44] thought, isn't it interesting? I
[48:45] thought, why is he talking about Gad?
[48:47] Okay. Why is he talking about Gad? Now
[48:50] we have I don't know if you can see it
[48:52] very well but to the east of Gad there
[48:53] this is where the 12 tribes were in the
[48:55] times of Joshua right this is where they
[48:57] took the land there now Ammon is east of
[49:00] Gad okay so you'd say well of course
[49:02] they talk about gad because the
[49:03] Ammonites can just invade there but to
[49:05] me now we know the promised land
[49:07] represents the Holy Ghost it represents
[49:11] see the new birth takes us across Jordan
[49:14] is death to self you got to die out to
[49:16] yourself and then we step into the
[49:18] promised
[49:19] where every promise is open up to open
[49:21] up to us, but we've got to fight for
[49:23] every promise. And that big fight really
[49:25] is a dying to self. That's the thing we
[49:29] got to wrestle with is this own flesh
[49:31] man. I mean, he is the one who gets in
[49:33] the way. If you can get him out of the
[49:34] way, then nothing can stop you. Amen.
[49:37] Where you say, "What about the enemy? He
[49:38] was defeated that day on Calvary. He's
[49:40] nothing but a bluff. You've got to call
[49:42] his bluff. Doesn't matter how real he
[49:44] is, how how real the feelings are. It
[49:47] doesn't matter how great the
[49:48] imaginations may be in your mind, you've
[49:50] got to realize he's bluffing. You got to
[49:52] call his bluff. Call his charade. Amen.
[49:55] Call his hand. So when I looked at this,
[49:57] I thought, well, what happened in Gad?
[50:00] Cuz something happened in Gad. That's
[50:02] very significant. Now Gad, you'll notice
[50:06] I don't you probably can't see it, but
[50:08] there where so so the river Jordan comes
[50:10] down. Sorry, I don't have a pointer.
[50:12] Then there's so on one side is Jericho
[50:16] on the other side is Gad. Okay. So what
[50:19] happened there when they c on the other
[50:21] side of Jericho? What promise laid there
[50:24] in Gad? Well, there was a rapture in
[50:26] Gad. Amen. Elijah and Elisha crossed the
[50:29] river Jordan and that's where Elijah
[50:31] went up in a in a rapture. So the
[50:34] question comes out, why do you let the
[50:36] Ammonites possess that promise when it's
[50:38] your promise in your promised land?
[50:41] Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is where Elisha
[50:45] received a double portion
[50:47] &gt;&gt; of the anointing.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; It's your God-given right. Amen. To
[50:54] receive a double portion of the
[50:55] anointing. But you see, what we do is we
[50:58] let some ammonite spirit say, "No, that
[51:00] was just for the prophet." And the
[51:02] supernatural, yes, we believe it, but
[51:03] it's just back there. And God doesn't do
[51:05] the same things today. That's out of
[51:07] nonsense. Amen. That's a lie of the
[51:08] devil trying to push you out of your
[51:10] inheritance where God has given us the
[51:12] double portion of his anointing. Amen.
[51:14] It's for every young man, boy, girl,
[51:16] old, young, whoever it is, whosoever
[51:18] will, it's for you and I this morning.
[51:20] Amen. A double portion of the spirit
[51:22] that was on the prophet now rest upon
[51:24] the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. So now
[51:26] we're going to realize this is part of
[51:27] what happened in Gad.
[51:30] So why on earth would we let some
[51:34] why would we let some spirit tell us
[51:37] that's not for us?
[51:40] Don't let some ammonite tell you that
[51:42] the days of miracles is passed. Don't
[51:45] let any kind of spirit tell you that
[51:46] that was just for the prophet but the
[51:48] message and and that the message has no
[51:50] power. It's got no resurrection in it.
[51:53] It's got a lot of resurrection power in
[51:55] it. It is the resurrection of life
[51:57] because this message is Jesus Christ.
[51:59] Don't let some Ammonite spirit tell you
[52:00] this message is just doctrine and rules
[52:02] and lining up to some kind of cre. It's
[52:04] not that at all. It's got nothing to do
[52:07] with that. It's God revealing himself,
[52:09] showing himself and he reveals himself
[52:11] to you and you just surrender to it and
[52:13] he transforms you to match his word and
[52:15] then you walk on with God. That's what
[52:17] the message is. The message is Christ in
[52:19] you, the hope of glory. The message has
[52:21] come to awaken sons and daughters to
[52:23] their position. Amen. I was talking to
[52:25] Christine last night. I said, "William
[52:27] needs to realize that he's more than the
[52:30] son of son of Ben and Christine Gloin."
[52:34] He's got to come to a place where he
[52:35] realizes, "No, they may be my earthly
[52:37] parents, but I've got a heavenly parent
[52:39] that brought me to the earth, and now
[52:41] he's revealing himself to me that he
[52:44] will live through my life that he can
[52:45] manifest who I'm really meant to be."
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Elisha would receive a double
[52:52] portion there. He would see uh Elijah go
[52:55] up in the in the what we call a rapture
[52:57] going up in the chariot and the mantle
[52:59] fell upon him and now that same spirit
[53:01] was now upon Elisha and then we so so
[53:04] what began in Gad there would end up in
[53:06] the eighth miracle that Elisha did. Now
[53:08] the eighth miracle Elisha did we know he
[53:11] was dead when it happened. He did seven
[53:13] miracles and then the critics started
[53:15] writing websites saying he's one short
[53:17] he's a false prophet. That's the problem
[53:20] is they're caught up in the signs and
[53:21] not the word. That's the problem. Caught
[53:23] up in the prophet and not the word that
[53:25] he brought. Amen. So then what happened
[53:26] is that that they begin to criticize.
[53:28] Well, he's won short. But then there was
[53:30] a battle going on. There was troublesome
[53:32] times going on. There was war and strife
[53:34] going on. And two men were carrying one
[53:36] of their dead friends. And they saw an
[53:38] open hole and they just threw him in.
[53:40] And they had no idea it was the separ of
[53:42] Elisha. Amen. As soon as that dead man
[53:44] hit the bones of Elisha, a resurrection
[53:46] took place. Hallelujah. I tell you what,
[53:49] friends, it wasn't Elisha's human
[53:51] ability. It wasn't what he thought he
[53:53] did and how good he was that brought
[53:54] forth that resurrection. It was just a
[53:56] life with living within him. Amen. It's
[53:59] the same thing in the life of Jesus
[54:00] Christ in you. Amen. We'll bring Christ
[54:02] we'll bring the dead in Christ out of
[54:04] the grave. Amen. It won't be how you're
[54:06] having a good day, bad day, good day,
[54:08] whatever's going on. Your bank account,
[54:10] no bank account, that's got nothing to
[54:11] do with it. It's a life that quickening
[54:14] power. Amen. It's living in you. Amen.
[54:16] Will bring the dead out of the grave.
[54:19] You say, "Is that scriptural?"
[54:20] Absolutely. It's a harvest, is it not?
[54:22] Amen. And what happens when a harvest
[54:24] happens is the farmer looks out on the
[54:26] field and says the life is mature.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I've never seen a sensible I've never
[54:30] seen any um farmer actually harvest
[54:32] wheat that's green.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; They wait for it to become mature. So
[54:36] it's the life that that's expressed out
[54:38] of the wheat calls to the farmer, I'm
[54:41] ready. It's not the farmer waking up one
[54:43] day saying, "Well, I guess I'll do it
[54:45] today. I've got a gap in my schedule."
[54:46] No, he looks at his crop and he says,
[54:48] "It's it's mature. I'm going to harvest
[54:51] this field. Amen. And the Lord is
[54:53] looking upon the earth and he's looking
[54:54] for seed. Amen. That's come to maturity.
[54:58] He sees it more than you do. I doubt any
[55:01] of us would think we're ready.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Mature, right?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way. God knows when you're
[55:08] ready,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; right? And it may take a long time, may
[55:11] take a very short time, but I tell you
[55:12] what, we'll all be at whatever stage God
[55:15] wants us to be mature. You'll be there
[55:16] when the rapture happens. Amen. So the
[55:19] life in us of Christ that's on display.
[55:21] He looks at that and says that's ready
[55:23] for a harvest.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; So it brings a dead out of the grave.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this happened in
[55:29] Gad. This is very significant. You look
[55:33] at these promises.
[55:35] Amen. Don't let any ammonite spirit tell
[55:38] you that applying the token is just
[55:40] playing a tape. Brother said that people
[55:42] will come into the message. They come
[55:44] into the word and they swap the
[55:46] supernatural out for the natural. You
[55:48] read about restoration of the bride tree
[55:50] takes a supernatural move. They just
[55:52] make it a natural thing. Don't let some
[55:54] spirits say just playing a tape is
[55:55] applying the token. Applying the token
[55:57] is the Holy Ghost living in your life
[55:59] coming down into your home creating an
[56:01] atmosphere and if the people want it,
[56:03] they'll fall into it and receive it.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural move of God. Oh, God
[56:09] don't do that. Yes, he does.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; How many times we had God just move and
[56:13] take over and we get lost in the
[56:15] presence of God? That's the token coming
[56:17] down,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; living himself out of you and I.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Some of us are here. Some of us are
[56:23] waiting for it to finish.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Don't let an Ammonite spirit tell you
[56:28] that can't happen in your life.
[56:31] You're sons and daughters of God. God
[56:34] wants you to possess that promise. He's
[56:36] made you to possess it. You have to be
[56:39] willing to go get it, though.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how does this time with
[56:42] Wednesday about rest?" I'm resting in
[56:44] the fact I'm a son of God. Yes.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I'm passed from death unto life.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; You want to see a resurrection? You
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Here it is. I was once dead. Now I'm
[56:53] alive.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now my body's just going to
[56:56] catch up with it one day.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:00] Amen.
[57:03] The message is Jesus Christ in you, the
[57:06] hope of glory. Amen. Sons of daughters
[57:09] of God are not content with living below
[57:12] their privilege.
[57:14] They are not satisfied with living in a
[57:16] servant or a slave mentality. A son and
[57:19] daughter of God wants full sunship.
[57:21] There's something in them driving them,
[57:23] motivating them. Amen. They want all
[57:25] that God has for them.
[57:28] Amen. That's why we can say there are
[57:29] sons in this day to possess every
[57:32] promise. Amen. Elisha would pray when he
[57:34] when the mant mantle came down on him.
[57:36] The first prayer, if I could say it this
[57:38] way, that Elisha would pray when he
[57:39] received the double portion is when he
[57:41] went back to the Jordan with that same
[57:43] mantle that he saw Elijah smite the man
[57:45] uh Jordan with and it and it separated
[57:47] and he says, "Where is the God of
[57:49] Elijah?" And he smites the Jordan and it
[57:51] separates exactly the same way that
[57:53] Elijah did it. That was the first that
[57:56] was the first thing that happened in Gad
[57:58] to prove that the God of the prophet is
[57:59] the God of the bride.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then now we could bring
[58:03] this into our day and say like sister
[58:05] Shannon years ago got a prayer meeting
[58:06] cried out where are you? Where's the God
[58:07] of Elijah?
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then Isaac had a real touch
[58:11] and he was changed. Even saw him after
[58:12] say he looks different.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Hal hallelujah. Amen. We have you our
[58:16] first fairy camp. We had a couple of
[58:18] young sisters come and and they
[58:20] basically gave God an ultimatum. God if
[58:21] this message is you show me at this camp
[58:25] otherwise I'm leaving. And God in his
[58:27] great infinite grace revealed himself to
[58:29] them that this message is him.
[58:32] changed their lives. Amen. I think it
[58:34] was the same camp maybe as brother Ken,
[58:36] you had your change. The God of Elijah
[58:38] came to him.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God ain't finished.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same God today. He
[58:45] hasn't. We haven't gone cold, formal,
[58:47] lukewarm, palace. No, we become more
[58:49] mature. God's matured us. Molders has
[58:51] shaped us. And we're under greater
[58:53] expectation now than we've been our
[58:54] entire lives because we've seen God do
[58:56] too much.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was just over a year ago
[59:00] when we're when our when our hot water
[59:02] was busted. I want to tell it cuz I want
[59:04] to tell it.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to tell it. We realize we
[59:08] live in a realm of the supernatural.
[59:10] Amen. Church is supernatural. Your life
[59:11] is supernatural. The sons and daughters
[59:13] of God walk in a supernatural realm. You
[59:16] may not even be aware of it, but your
[59:18] life is more supernatural than you
[59:19] realize. This message coming to you was
[59:21] a supernatural event that God had on his
[59:24] calendar. And God knew that on a certain
[59:25] day at a certain moment your heart would
[59:27] come open and he would bring his word to
[59:29] you and he would transform your life and
[59:31] you'd realize God has sons. God has
[59:34] daughters and here I am to possess every
[59:36] divine promise of God. Hallelujah. So
[59:40] our gas hot water cylinder was on the
[59:43] anyway it died or it had to be cut off
[59:46] otherwise a fire could have happened.
[59:48] Plumber came along disconnected the
[59:49] water from the house disconnected the
[59:51] gas turned it off. It was a dead s
[59:53] isolated system and Jimmy and Jimmy and
[59:56] Stephanie were there. So I'm sure you
[59:57] can say amen, you know, to this because
[59:59] they were staying with us on that
[1:00:01] weekend. And I just said to, you know,
[1:00:03] so we had no hot water. We had Tony and
[1:00:05] Sharon point in there with their
[1:00:06] children. We had a full house. And you
[1:00:09] know, I said to Christine be because of
[1:00:11] on the Friday the water was
[1:00:12] disconnected, the cylinder was turned
[1:00:14] off, all those things. On the Monday,
[1:00:15] the plumber was coming back. So now
[1:00:17] we're now we're here on Sunday morning,
[1:00:18] I think it was. And I said to Christine,
[1:00:21] I said, 'You know, the not even thinking
[1:00:22] about it, I said, 'You know, the Lord
[1:00:24] loves you enough he can give you hot
[1:00:25] water if he wants to. And then so we
[1:00:28] were up in the bathroom and we just had
[1:00:29] a we had the jug and we had a bowl and
[1:00:32] we're just filling up the jug and making
[1:00:33] hot water from the from the jug. And
[1:00:35] anyway, she goes takes the bowl to the
[1:00:37] um takes the jug to the shower to um to
[1:00:40] to to fill it up and she turns it on and
[1:00:42] just instant hot water comes out.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And she says, "Well, I'm going to have a
[1:00:46] shower then." So she stepped into the
[1:00:48] blessing. She stepped into the blessing
[1:00:50] and then she said, "Hey, you have a
[1:00:51] shower, too." So, I stepped into the
[1:00:53] blessing. Hallelujah. And then and then
[1:00:56] Jimmy was downstairs in the other shower
[1:00:57] and had half a blessing.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; And then so the same plumber came back
[1:01:04] on Monday.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And so Christine says, "Well, we had hot
[1:01:07] water yesterday morning. We had
[1:01:09] showers." And he looked at me uh looked
[1:01:11] at her rather and said, "No, you didn't.
[1:01:14] I can't believe you. That thing was
[1:01:16] completely disconnected. the the pilot
[1:01:18] light was off, everything. It was
[1:01:20] impossible for that to happen.
[1:01:23] Well, he doesn't have to believe it. I
[1:01:25] had the blessing. I don't care what
[1:01:27] people say about God can't do things.
[1:01:29] Well, well, I've seen him do a lot of
[1:01:30] things. Amen. So, you take it up with
[1:01:32] him cuz, you know, we received it,
[1:01:33] right? But the point is, if God if God
[1:01:36] can create hot water where there's no
[1:01:37] hot water, can he not create your need?
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Can he not with his creative power touch
[1:01:45] your life? and do the same kind of
[1:01:48] things.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; We are living in the day where the third
[1:01:51] pull is here.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; The power of the spoken word is here. We
[1:01:55] don't need to manufacture it. We don't
[1:01:56] need to try and talk it up. It's just a
[1:01:59] life of God living.
[1:02:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:04] So if he can do if he can give us hot
[1:02:07] water, can he get your prodal? Can he
[1:02:10] bring healing?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Can he touch your children? Can he bring
[1:02:14] you peace? Can he give you the Holy
[1:02:16] Ghost? Can he not do those things? Can't
[1:02:19] he create a desire in someone for God
[1:02:21] that says they have no desire? Can he
[1:02:23] not create those things? He's God. He
[1:02:25] can do whatever he wants whenever he
[1:02:26] wants. Amen. So why? But we realize we
[1:02:30] live in the age of the double portion.
[1:02:32] Amen. We don't just have a bit of the
[1:02:34] Holy Ghost that's been poured out by
[1:02:36] measure down through the ages. But the
[1:02:38] fullness of Christ has been revealed in
[1:02:39] this day. All that Christ is has been
[1:02:41] poured into the church. Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we live in the season of the
[1:02:47] double portion. So, why would we let
[1:02:49] some Ammonite spirit tell us it ain't
[1:02:51] for you?
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; It can't happen.
[1:02:55] That's No, that's my promise. Are there
[1:02:58] no sons and daughters today that can
[1:03:00] rise up and say, "The resurrection's my
[1:03:03] promise." Amen. That everything in God
[1:03:05] is mine.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. From the anointing that was on the
[1:03:08] prophets now, now on me, to the power of
[1:03:11] the spoken word. Amen. to the rapture to
[1:03:13] the resurrection of the dead saints. All
[1:03:15] those promises are mine by birthright.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by anything I've earned. No, I
[1:03:20] just aired it by Jesus Christ cuz we are
[1:03:22] joint ears with Christ. So everything
[1:03:24] that he fell air to, I fallen air too.
[1:03:27] Amen. Like someone said about Muhammad
[1:03:28] Ali, he would train. He would sweat it
[1:03:31] out. He would take blows in training.
[1:03:33] He'd go around the world and have these
[1:03:34] big pressure bouts and fights and and
[1:03:37] then after it was all done, he received
[1:03:38] a check, a paycheck. I guess we don't
[1:03:40] have those here anymore. He got it
[1:03:42] entered into his bank account
[1:03:43] electronically.
[1:03:45] Then his wife, who did none of the
[1:03:47] wrestling, none of the fighting, none of
[1:03:48] the sweating, none of the training, got
[1:03:50] to receive that money.
[1:03:53] He won it. She had it
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; because she's part of him.
[1:03:59] He won it. The Lord Jesus won it all.
[1:04:01] We've had it.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:06] So all those things are here.
[1:04:11] Brother says the mantle is here tonight.
[1:04:12] I say this morning that same Holy Spirit
[1:04:14] that was upon Jesus Christ is in this
[1:04:16] church tonight. I say this morning to
[1:04:18] robe any believer that's in here with
[1:04:19] the power from on high. It's here. Jesus
[1:04:23] Christ is here today. Amen. This message
[1:04:26] is a message of miracles. Amen. It is a
[1:04:29] living proof that God lives. Amen. He is
[1:04:32] still Jehovah of miracles. I don't care
[1:04:34] how difficult, how impossible it seems.
[1:04:36] No, God specializes in the impossible.
[1:04:38] When you get to the end of yourself,
[1:04:40] that's when he can step in and do what
[1:04:42] only he can do. Amen.
[1:04:46] But you see, this message has come to
[1:04:48] identify sons.
[1:04:50] Amen. Just like when when David David
[1:04:53] would be called, he wasn't even invited.
[1:04:56] the first time when when when Samuel
[1:04:59] came to Jesse's house, God told the
[1:05:01] prophet, you have a king in your h, you
[1:05:03] know, Jesse's house. You're going to I'm
[1:05:05] going to point him out to you. And then
[1:05:07] and then when Jesse when Samuel comes to
[1:05:09] Jesse and Samuel says to Jesse, go get
[1:05:11] your sons. Doesn't even explain it, you
[1:05:13] know, all his his purpose, but but just
[1:05:15] go get your sons. And then and and he
[1:05:18] sees the eldest and and Samuel in his
[1:05:19] mind's thinking, this is the one who's
[1:05:21] going to be anointed. This is the one
[1:05:23] who's going to take the throne. This is
[1:05:24] the most likely looking one. And God
[1:05:26] says, "No." And then one by one there's
[1:05:28] no, "No, no, no, no." And then Samuel
[1:05:31] looks around and and he sees he's been
[1:05:32] through those sons. He asks Jesse, "Do
[1:05:34] you have another son?" Just imagine the
[1:05:36] look on Jesse's face. The like the
[1:05:37] realization, "Oh, yeah, I do."
[1:05:41] Well, where is he? Well, he's he's
[1:05:43] looking after my sheep. He's not even I
[1:05:45] actually didn't even think about him.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; I I didn't even consider him. Think
[1:05:49] about it. And then Samuel says, "Well,
[1:05:52] go get him because we're not going to
[1:05:53] sit down till the lad's here."
[1:05:55] Amen. And then so as soon as David came
[1:05:57] into the presence of Samuel, Amen. God
[1:05:59] said, "That's him.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; That's the one I'm looking for. That's
[1:06:03] the identified son." Amen. And I tell
[1:06:05] you what, friends, a vindicated prophet
[1:06:07] has come to the earth. And God gave a
[1:06:10] horn of anointing oil, a ram's horn.
[1:06:12] Amen. And he poured it out completely on
[1:06:14] this age. Amen. Anointing has come upon
[1:06:16] the earth. And it's brought all kinds of
[1:06:18] things to manifestation. Amen. Russia's
[1:06:21] doing what it's going to do cuz it was
[1:06:22] prophesied. I mean, the Vatican is doing
[1:06:24] what it's going to do because it's
[1:06:25] prophesied. America is doing what it's
[1:06:27] doing because it was prophesied. But the
[1:06:29] anointing wasn't for them. Amen. It was
[1:06:31] for the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. So,
[1:06:34] this word has been poured out. Amen. And
[1:06:36] and what happened is it came in contact
[1:06:38] with you. It came in contact with a
[1:06:40] predestinated soul.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is it doing? It's
[1:06:44] identifying you're my son. You're my
[1:06:47] daughter. Amen. I'm proud of you. I've
[1:06:49] been looking for you. Amen. I tell you
[1:06:52] what, friends. A big damage that people
[1:06:54] do in this day is they don't recognize
[1:06:56] their children when they become adults.
[1:06:59] And it leaves scars either a distant
[1:07:01] father or non-existent father leaves a
[1:07:03] void in a son's heart. Cuz a it's the
[1:07:05] father that call calls the son and
[1:07:08] daughter to womanhood or manhood. It's
[1:07:10] not the mother that does it. It takes
[1:07:12] the father to do it. It takes it takes
[1:07:15] the father to to raise up his children
[1:07:18] and then eventually come to a place to
[1:07:19] recognize you're an adult now. You're
[1:07:22] not a child just being led about, but
[1:07:25] you are you're an adult now with adult
[1:07:27] responsibilities being led by God where
[1:07:30] where where the parent where the father
[1:07:32] raises them to transition them from
[1:07:34] walking with mom and dad to walking with
[1:07:36] God alone. But there has to come a
[1:07:38] realization
[1:07:40] or rather a recognition by the father
[1:07:42] for these things. Same thing with a you
[1:07:45] know with a with a girl who becomes a
[1:07:47] woman. It's, you know, it's crazy how
[1:07:48] fathers can be so unhappy because a a
[1:07:51] daughter is always wanting the father's
[1:07:53] approval. Whether they say it or not,
[1:07:56] there's it's subconscious. They need the
[1:07:58] approval of daddy. But then when they
[1:08:00] become a teenager, they become a woman.
[1:08:02] And of course, the father just doesn't
[1:08:04] know what to do with their daughter.
[1:08:05] They say, "I wish you were a girl again.
[1:08:07] I don't like what you're becoming."
[1:08:08] Basically, their their mood and their
[1:08:10] and their and their actions kind of say
[1:08:12] that to the daughter. What does it do to
[1:08:14] the daughter? I can't go back to what I
[1:08:17] was. I'm a woman now. You've got to
[1:08:20] recognize me for what I am. And and if
[1:08:22] the father does not do that, it leaves a
[1:08:24] void. And that woman will go looking,
[1:08:26] that daughter will go looking for
[1:08:27] approval in all the wrong places. Go to
[1:08:30] different men and different people
[1:08:31] trying to find approval where all they
[1:08:33] needed was their father to say, "You're
[1:08:35] a woman now."
[1:08:37] Are you following me? It's powerful. It
[1:08:40] takes it takes the word. See you see the
[1:08:42] husband or the father is the word right
[1:08:45] and now in a true sense it's only the
[1:08:47] word can bring a son or daughter to
[1:08:51] maturity to their adoption to their
[1:08:52] position amen but we as fathers must see
[1:08:56] he couldn't find a man in Ezekiel we
[1:08:58] read couldn't find a man to stand in the
[1:09:00] gap to stand in the hedge to be a real
[1:09:03] man not a not a boy man that's just
[1:09:06] consumed by their own thing but a real
[1:09:08] man that's watching over his family has
[1:09:10] a has has a burden for his family, has a
[1:09:12] burden for the church, has a longing to
[1:09:14] see God live. I mean, he's not
[1:09:16] interested in his own affairs, but he's
[1:09:18] more interested in others affairs, and
[1:09:20] he's not some boneless, boneless,
[1:09:22] backless, you know, kind of jellyfish
[1:09:24] servant, but no, he's got a real burden.
[1:09:26] He loves, he places his family above
[1:09:29] himself. So, he serves them, but he's
[1:09:31] got vision. We should have a vision as
[1:09:33] men. What do we want to see? We want to
[1:09:36] see our young people become adults in
[1:09:38] Christ. I mean, we want to see them have
[1:09:40] their own experience that they become
[1:09:42] comfortable in their own skin.
[1:09:44] We don't want them to have this void in
[1:09:46] their lives saying, "Where do I fit?"
[1:09:48] And and and who am I now? And all these
[1:09:50] kind of gender confusion things that are
[1:09:51] pushed by the world. We want to be real
[1:09:53] men that God can live through us. Amen.
[1:09:56] To raise our young people to be mature
[1:09:59] adults that are filled with the spirit
[1:10:01] of God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Is that not what we want?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes it takes the word in
[1:10:07] you to do it.
[1:10:09] Amen. That's why it even says in Malachi
[1:10:11] 4. Now that scripture has got compound
[1:10:13] meaning, but it says that I'll turn the
[1:10:15] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:10:17] and the hearts of the children to the
[1:10:18] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[1:10:20] of the curse. We know that that
[1:10:22] scripture shows the two comingings of
[1:10:24] Elijah. We understand that. But also
[1:10:26] shows that that that the hearts of the
[1:10:28] children must be turned to the hearts of
[1:10:30] the fathers. There's got to be there's
[1:10:32] got to be a connection within the
[1:10:33] family.
[1:10:35] Amen. Least I smite the earth with a
[1:10:37] curse. So there's got to be men to stand
[1:10:39] up to take every divine promise and not
[1:10:42] just things that are nice ideas, but
[1:10:44] tangible realities of I'm going to have
[1:10:46] a real relationship with my family. I
[1:10:48] may have no idea how to do it, but God,
[1:10:50] you show me how to do it. I want to step
[1:10:52] out of my comfort zone. I'm going to try
[1:10:54] and spark a conversation. I'm going to
[1:10:57] start trying to do things with them, and
[1:10:58] I may have no idea how to do it, but
[1:11:00] Lord, you show me because I got promises
[1:11:02] to inherit. I don't want to let the I
[1:11:05] don't want to allow the problems of my
[1:11:08] childhood affecting them.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to break that cycle. You
[1:11:12] see, it takes a man to stand up and say
[1:11:14] enough is enough. I'm not just going to
[1:11:16] continue on the problems of the past,
[1:11:18] but I'm going to let God come into my
[1:11:20] life and change those things. I mean,
[1:11:22] that their child is not the same as my
[1:11:24] childhood where maybe you're neglected
[1:11:26] as a parent. I mean, um, you know, as a
[1:11:28] child, maybe maybe your parents were
[1:11:30] distant. Maybe because they are working
[1:11:31] not not even bad intentions but maybe
[1:11:33] there's a void in your life. I say let
[1:11:36] God fill that void. I mean this is why
[1:11:38] to me see Jesse naturally did not
[1:11:41] acknowledge David but God supernaturally
[1:11:44] acknowledge David. So even if your own
[1:11:46] father doesn't recognize you as who you
[1:11:48] should be and you know you know as a as
[1:11:50] a real child of God let God come and
[1:11:54] anoint you. Amen. That you'll realize I
[1:11:57] am a son. I am a daughter of God. And
[1:11:59] that will transcend, that will fix any
[1:12:01] natural problems that you have.
[1:12:04] Amen.
[1:12:06] Praise the Lord. This message identifies
[1:12:09] who you really are. That's the only
[1:12:11] thing upon the earth that'll do it is
[1:12:13] the word of God. Amen. Eagles produce
[1:12:16] eagles, right? Eagles produce eagles.
[1:12:20] Samuel actually produced a king,
[1:12:22] prophet,
[1:12:24] priest.
[1:12:25] Okay? He could recognize God. and Samuel
[1:12:28] could recognize another attribute of God
[1:12:30] in David and that's why he was anointed
[1:12:32] to be king. But you see what happens is
[1:12:35] eagles produce eagles. So now if we are
[1:12:37] real men, if we're real woman of God
[1:12:40] with our children, we will desire that
[1:12:42] the life of God within us will actually
[1:12:44] become known to them within them.
[1:12:46] Because to be honest, when we are born,
[1:12:48] we don't know what's within us. I
[1:12:50] remember when Analise was a baby, I was
[1:12:52] holding her thinking, I don't know
[1:12:53] what's in the what's in her, Lord. What
[1:12:54] gift? what potential, you know, and I
[1:12:58] trust we look at our all of our children
[1:12:59] the same way. Lord, we don't know what's
[1:13:01] within them.
[1:13:03] Jesse had no idea what was within David
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; being a shepherd boy. God did. That's
[1:13:09] why he anointed him. That's why he
[1:13:10] inspired him to anoint him, right? But
[1:13:12] you see, eagles produce eagles. Now,
[1:13:14] baby eagles before they fly, they don't
[1:13:16] even realize they can really do it.
[1:13:18] They're on the nest. They're flapping
[1:13:19] their wings. They're getting ready. But
[1:13:21] they see mom come and saw down, papa
[1:13:23] sword down with food and do great
[1:13:24] majestic swoops and all these things.
[1:13:26] And you know, they're just sitting on
[1:13:27] the nest just in awe and wonder of what
[1:13:29] their parents are doing. But they don't
[1:13:31] realize that they're built of the same
[1:13:33] material. Amen. And then what? But but
[1:13:35] mama and papa know it. Amen. They know
[1:13:38] it. And they don't want their children
[1:13:40] just to be these little nest dwellers
[1:13:42] that can't fly and can't be full eagles.
[1:13:44] They are determined that they want their
[1:13:47] children to be at least as much eagle as
[1:13:49] they are in ability. Right? A real
[1:13:51] father does not have a condescending
[1:13:54] look towards their children saying, "I
[1:13:56] was better at your age. I could do this
[1:13:57] and I'm better at you and you'll never
[1:13:59] obtain the same greatness as me." No,
[1:14:01] that's not a real father. That's an
[1:14:03] insecure boy. Amen. But a real father
[1:14:06] wants to lift his family above himself.
[1:14:08] Amen. A real mama wants that, too.
[1:14:10] They're not interested in trying to be
[1:14:12] better than their children. They want
[1:14:13] their children to be better than them.
[1:14:15] And the quicker that they surpass them
[1:14:16] in ability and love of God and you know
[1:14:19] all these things, the happier they are.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I'm glad some say amen to that.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we want, isn't it?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not we're not feeling bad,
[1:14:28] man. They're better than us. We're like,
[1:14:29] "Praise God.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; I'm excited." Amen. Why? Cuz you see,
[1:14:33] God unlocked the potential within their
[1:14:35] lives. Amen. So, what happens is mama,
[1:14:38] because mama knows that the baby eagles
[1:14:40] are made of the same material as her,
[1:14:42] what does she do? She begins to stir up
[1:14:44] the nest. She begins to make it
[1:14:46] uncomfortable. Amen. For the babies
[1:14:48] because they need to leave the nest and
[1:14:51] start flying with mama that they begin
[1:14:53] to realize what they admired in mama's
[1:14:55] is in them by birth. Amen. And this is
[1:14:57] what happens with the Lord. What he does
[1:14:59] is he as he as he is he's waved himself
[1:15:01] over the earth. He's proved himself
[1:15:03] through a prophet's ministry, right? And
[1:15:05] we see it's Christ revealed in this day.
[1:15:08] And but God doesn't want us just to
[1:15:10] admire that life in him. He wants you to
[1:15:13] know that same life by the baptism of
[1:15:15] the Holy Ghost is in you.
[1:15:18] He that believeth on me, the works that
[1:15:21] I do shall he do also cuz I go to the
[1:15:23] father. Isn't that what Jesus said?
[1:15:25] That's not he as in he that believeth as
[1:15:28] in one person. That's old English saying
[1:15:29] whoever basically right.
[1:15:33] So mama stirs up the nest. The babies
[1:15:35] have got to fly. Then they begin to
[1:15:37] realize, I'm made of the same material
[1:15:39] as mama. And we see the word manifested
[1:15:43] and we see it living out of our lives.
[1:15:45] We begin to realize we're of the same
[1:15:47] material as the word by the grace of
[1:15:49] God.
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:53] The message did not come to make church
[1:15:55] people. It come to make identified sons
[1:15:58] and daughters of God. Amen. The
[1:16:00] transforming power of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:02] makes people into, it gives people power
[1:16:05] to become sons, sons of God. John 1:12
[1:16:08] says, "But as many as received him, to
[1:16:10] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:16:12] God, even to them that believe on his
[1:16:14] name." Amen. I'm sure this is nothing
[1:16:17] new to anyone. We've seen this message
[1:16:19] transform us.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. To show you you're a you are a
[1:16:23] son. Remember, the new birth doesn't
[1:16:25] make you a child of God. You you are
[1:16:27] born again because you are a child. as
[1:16:29] it says in Galatians, because you are
[1:16:31] sons, he sent forth the spirit where you
[1:16:33] cry, abba, father. You don't become a
[1:16:35] son or daughter by the new birth. You
[1:16:37] already are. That's why you're reborn.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:44] And where are we now? Now, sorry, this
[1:16:46] is a bit of um the girls already seen
[1:16:49] this in um we had family altar during
[1:16:50] the week and we read this. But you see,
[1:16:52] there was there was uh five daughters
[1:16:54] and I'll try and read these names. You
[1:16:56] can laugh with me. said, "Then came the
[1:16:58] daughters of Zeopa, the the son of
[1:17:00] Hepha, the son of Gilead, the son of uh
[1:17:03] Mata, the son of Manasseh, of the
[1:17:05] families of Manasse, the son of Joseph.
[1:17:07] And these are the names of the
[1:17:08] daughters, okay? Uh Mala, Noah, Hogla,
[1:17:12] Mila, and
[1:17:15] that one,
[1:17:16] the youngest one."
[1:17:19] But you see now,
[1:17:22] they came to Moses, right? These are
[1:17:25] real daughters.
[1:17:27] These are real daughters of God. A
[1:17:29] daughter of God or a son of God wants
[1:17:31] their inheritance more than anything.
[1:17:33] They want what God has for them. They
[1:17:35] are not willing just to float with the
[1:17:37] crowd and be and have no possession.
[1:17:40] Right? Amen. So, so here they go. They
[1:17:42] come to Moses and they stood before
[1:17:44] Moses and Eleaz the priest and and
[1:17:46] before the princes all the congregation
[1:17:48] by the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:17:50] congregation saying our fathers I mean
[1:17:52] our father died in the wilderness and he
[1:17:54] was not but and he was not in the
[1:17:56] company of them that gathered themselves
[1:17:57] together against the Lord in the company
[1:17:59] of Kora but died in his own sin and had
[1:18:01] no sons. Why should the name of our
[1:18:04] father be done away with from among his
[1:18:05] brethren I mean from his family because
[1:18:07] he hath no son. give unto us therefore a
[1:18:10] possession among the brethren for our
[1:18:14] father.
[1:18:15] Up to this time, there's nothing in the
[1:18:17] word that says a daughter could inherit
[1:18:19] a promise
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; in the land. There was nothing. But you
[1:18:23] see what they did is because they were
[1:18:24] real daughters of Abraham. They wanted
[1:18:27] their inheritance.
[1:18:29] Amen. So, they weren't just willing to
[1:18:31] sit back with a poor me attitude of,
[1:18:35] "Well, I guess we'll be homeless now. We
[1:18:37] got nothing to pass on if we have
[1:18:39] children and we're just a victim of
[1:18:41] circumstance and we're just a victim of,
[1:18:43] you know, you know what our what our
[1:18:45] father did and it's it's all his fault
[1:18:47] and our upbringing did this and this is
[1:18:49] why we're this way and they weren't like
[1:18:51] that. No, they were. They said, "Look,
[1:18:53] he died in his sin in the wilderness. We
[1:18:54] acknowledge what he did, but give us our
[1:18:56] possession." I mean, they they they they
[1:18:59] went beyond the shadow of their father's
[1:19:01] life. I mean, I tell you what, a real
[1:19:03] son and daughter of God goes beyond the
[1:19:05] shadow of their upbringing. goes beyond
[1:19:06] the shadow of their past or their family
[1:19:09] lineage or where they're from or their
[1:19:10] culture. They go beyond that because
[1:19:13] they realize that my upbringing doesn't
[1:19:15] identify me. My nationality doesn't
[1:19:17] identify me. The word of God is my
[1:19:19] identification. Amen. So they can go
[1:19:21] beyond where they came from. Amen.
[1:19:23] Naturally, and say no, I want my
[1:19:25] possession in the promised land.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. They wanted their inheritance and
[1:19:29] they did not let the life of the
[1:19:31] unbelief of their father stop them.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because because he died in
[1:19:36] his own sin, his own unbelief. Amen.
[1:19:38] They did not let the stigma of their
[1:19:41] parents hinder them.
[1:19:43] Amen. This is things we got to wrestle
[1:19:45] with and overcome. They say, "Well, my
[1:19:48] parents were like this and this is the
[1:19:49] reputation they had." It's not your
[1:19:51] reputation.
[1:19:53] Amen. No. No. You're a son or daughter
[1:19:54] of God. Your reputation is Christ's
[1:19:57] reputation.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. They wanted that inheritance that
[1:20:01] their that their father should have
[1:20:03] passed on to them which was of joy,
[1:20:05] peace, faith, love, meekness,
[1:20:06] gentleness, all those things, the true
[1:20:09] identity of the word. They wanted that
[1:20:10] inheritance. He see you see he should
[1:20:12] have passed on this by living in faith
[1:20:15] in the living God and the reality of the
[1:20:17] promise of of God. He should have passed
[1:20:19] that reality on that God that the God
[1:20:21] they will follow was the same yesterday,
[1:20:23] today and forever. What a difference it
[1:20:25] would have been if you if you contrasted
[1:20:28] their house or their tent in the
[1:20:30] wilderness to Caleb's. Amen. Their house
[1:20:33] or their tent would have been grumbling,
[1:20:34] complaining, Moses this, Moses that, the
[1:20:37] message this, the message that problems,
[1:20:39] sand, trouble, all these things. No
[1:20:41] water, blah blah blah blah, negative,
[1:20:43] down, tense, whatever, that kind of
[1:20:45] thing. Now, let's go over into Caleb's
[1:20:48] tent. Hallelujah. Children,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you again,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I was with Joshua.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I walked up Joy Valley. I
[1:20:59] walked over Peace Mountain.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I saw the promised land. I
[1:21:03] ate the fruit of it. It's a good land,
[1:21:05] children. Amen. Our God that brought us
[1:21:07] out is not going to leave us in this
[1:21:09] wilderness. He promised before we left
[1:21:11] Egypt. We're going in, children. We're
[1:21:13] going in. Hallelujah. And then I tell
[1:21:15] you what, I saw a mountain and something
[1:21:17] in me said, "That's my mountain." Amen.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. I tell you what, we're going
[1:21:21] to live there and I'm going to take you
[1:21:22] to that physical place and I'm going to
[1:21:24] tell you where where these feet stood 40
[1:21:26] years ago is where we are today.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] Amen. Would have been a hallelujah glory
[1:21:34] shouting and maybe the tent would have
[1:21:35] been moving. It's the power of God. His
[1:21:37] faith brought him down. Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] Around the dinner table about how good
[1:21:41] God is.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a contrast that was.
[1:21:46] But you see, you see that generation,
[1:21:49] that younger generation like these five
[1:21:51] women here, God broke that cycle of
[1:21:53] unbelief and murmuring out of their
[1:21:55] lives. Amen. Cuz God was determined that
[1:21:58] the young generation will not live out
[1:22:00] the same problems and fussing and
[1:22:02] fighting, church splits and hatred and
[1:22:04] malice and strife and splits and all
[1:22:06] these things that the elder generation
[1:22:08] did. No, this young generation, we're
[1:22:10] living in a different season. I mean,
[1:22:12] we're living in a season where where
[1:22:13] there's a unity of spirit, where there's
[1:22:16] a reality of the word. Amen. Where God
[1:22:18] lives in every one of us. Amen. Where
[1:22:20] the promises of God are not just
[1:22:22] abstract ideas to talk about, but
[1:22:24] they're living reality. Amen. They're a
[1:22:26] real thing. Amen. Where we see the
[1:22:27] promises. Hallelujah. I trust you feel
[1:22:29] that way, too. I mean, we're living in a
[1:22:31] different dispensation. Why? Because
[1:22:33] we've pro crossed Jordan and we're
[1:22:35] living in Canaan's fair land.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:40] Amen.
[1:22:42] They stepped out as I said of the of the
[1:22:45] father um of the shadow of their father
[1:22:47] that that that that attitude. They did
[1:22:49] not have a poor me attitude. I mean a
[1:22:51] poor me attitude is such a bad one. Such
[1:22:53] a bad it's to have a victim mentality
[1:22:56] has never helped no one in the history
[1:22:58] of the world.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It has never helped anyone. It's never
[1:23:01] helped anyone possess any promise. Never
[1:23:03] helped anyone push on in life. But it
[1:23:05] just d them to dig a hole that they bury
[1:23:07] themselves in. Amen. People say, "Yo,
[1:23:10] poor me. I have no friends. No one cares
[1:23:12] about me. Now listen, I use my title.
[1:23:14] Listen. Amen. Listen. I just want to say
[1:23:17] this. I have never met a single person
[1:23:20] who's caring, who's friendly, who draws
[1:23:23] a circle bigger, who contacts people,
[1:23:26] who tries to arrange things to do. I've
[1:23:28] never ever met a single person like that
[1:23:30] that cares for others more than
[1:23:32] themselves. I've never met a single
[1:23:33] person like that that is lonely and has
[1:23:35] no friends.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know anyone that like that has no
[1:23:38] friends?
[1:23:39] No, because it's not in them. The they
[1:23:43] are friendly. They don't have a victim
[1:23:45] mentality. They don't have a poor
[1:23:47] mentality. But if the focus is all on us
[1:23:50] and poor us and no one cares, you know,
[1:23:52] there comes a time if you just project
[1:23:54] the vibe of I don't want to talk to you.
[1:23:56] I'm not interested in you. I don't want
[1:23:58] to take you up on an invitation to do
[1:24:00] something. You can't sit there and
[1:24:02] wonder why no one is your friend.
[1:24:06] You can't. You got to realize actually I
[1:24:09] need to change.
[1:24:11] Maybe you're from a family of very
[1:24:12] strictly independent, you know,
[1:24:14] isolationist people. God wants to break
[1:24:16] that out of you.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to take that from you
[1:24:19] cuz we're not meant to be an island by
[1:24:22] ourselves. We need one another.
[1:24:27] Amen. You say, "Well, you don't know
[1:24:28] what I've been through."
[1:24:30] I tell you what, listen. I got this in
[1:24:33] my notes. Listen, if the Lord if you
[1:24:35] ever open your heart and your eyes to
[1:24:37] what the Lord has done for you, you will
[1:24:40] never ever feel sorry for yourself
[1:24:42] again.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; You will never think you're a victim.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; No. The spirit, that spirit will leave
[1:24:48] you and you can't think the same. You
[1:24:51] can never sit there and say, "Poor me
[1:24:52] and woe is me and no one likes me." No.
[1:24:55] He came to love the unlovable. And I
[1:24:58] tell you, because he loved me.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, so we must never
[1:25:03] ever sit there and let the devil put us
[1:25:05] in a hole and say no one cares about us.
[1:25:08] That's not that's not the state of a
[1:25:09] believer. The devil wants to keep us
[1:25:11] that way to isolate us. But tell you
[1:25:13] what, friends, why on earth would a
[1:25:14] spirit would you allow a spirit to stand
[1:25:17] on your promise of having good,
[1:25:19] valuable, meaningful friendships and
[1:25:20] relationships to be part of the body.
[1:25:24] Amen. A believer can't live in that
[1:25:27] state. These five daughters weren't
[1:25:29] willing to live without an inheritance.
[1:25:31] Now they said it's our promised land.
[1:25:33] It's our inheritance which is in Christ
[1:25:35] the son of man. See they desired more
[1:25:37] than anything to have a possession in
[1:25:39] him in the land. Now notice you go read
[1:25:42] this account. It didn't say and the Lord
[1:25:45] spake unto Moses saying there's five
[1:25:47] daughters of a family and they have no
[1:25:49] brother to inherit and there they can't
[1:25:51] receive the possession. Therefore go get
[1:25:52] them and tell them they've got an
[1:25:54] inheritance. God didn't speak to Moses.
[1:25:57] They came to Moses. They came to the
[1:25:59] word. Amen. A real a real son or
[1:26:02] daughter of God does not sit back and
[1:26:05] wait God to push them through a pipe and
[1:26:07] give them everything. No, a real son and
[1:26:09] daughter of God has enough gumption in
[1:26:11] them to approach the throne of grace and
[1:26:13] say, "God, it's mine."
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, Lord, you've given it to me. I
[1:26:16] want that promise. I want the salvation
[1:26:18] of my family. I want my full
[1:26:20] inheritance, Lord. I'm not willing just
[1:26:22] to settle with a little bit. I want it
[1:26:24] all.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] They wanted to become to to live off
[1:26:29] that land, possess it, live off it,
[1:26:31] become one with it. And what did the
[1:26:34] Lord say? The daughters of Zilo Fahad
[1:26:38] speak, right?
[1:26:40] See, cuz this is the heart of God. I
[1:26:42] want to give it to you. He wants to give
[1:26:45] you the Holy Ghost more than you want to
[1:26:47] receive it. He wants to give you joy and
[1:26:49] speakable more than you want it. He
[1:26:50] wants to give you peace of past
[1:26:51] understanding more than you want to
[1:26:53] receive it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a quote, by the way.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; He wants to give it to you, but you've
[1:26:59] got to go get it. You've got to want it.
[1:27:03] Amen.
[1:27:05] But you see what happens is now, now I'm
[1:27:07] just going to What are we doing for
[1:27:08] time? We're doing good. Now, it says in
[1:27:10] Hebrews 11, and all these, see, if the
[1:27:12] heroes of faith could have been written
[1:27:14] longer, I believe those five women there
[1:27:16] we read about to me, they're the five
[1:27:17] wise virgin of the Old Testament. They
[1:27:20] wanted their someone who's foolish
[1:27:22] doesn't care. Those who are wise want
[1:27:23] everything God's given them.
[1:27:25] Amen. And so now, so Paul, he could
[1:27:28] have, if he had enough time or whatever,
[1:27:29] he maybe could have put them in. You
[1:27:31] see, because they are heroes of faith in
[1:27:32] my opinion because naturally they could
[1:27:34] not go fight for a possession. They
[1:27:37] weren't part of the army. Think about
[1:27:39] it. Naturally, they could not physically
[1:27:41] go drive some enemy off and possess some
[1:27:43] land. It was the men's job to do the
[1:27:45] fighting. But they went to the right
[1:27:47] source. They went to God. They didn't
[1:27:49] they weren't speaking to Moses. They're
[1:27:50] approaching God. Is this okay? Amen. And
[1:27:53] God said, "I'll give it to you."
[1:27:55] Amen. But you see now he says, "God, now
[1:27:58] and all these things, having obtained a
[1:27:59] good report through faith, received not
[1:28:01] the promise." God having provided some
[1:28:03] better thing for us that they without us
[1:28:05] should not be made perfect. Amen. So
[1:28:07] there's got to be a completion that is
[1:28:09] finished off by the last part of the
[1:28:12] body of Christ. So all the believers
[1:28:14] down through the ages without us cannot
[1:28:16] be made complete. And we are compassed
[1:28:19] about with so greater a cloud of
[1:28:21] witnesses. And sometimes it feels like
[1:28:23] there's more on that side than this
[1:28:25] side. As we see the saints go on.
[1:28:29] I'm sure we know a few real believers.
[1:28:32] Amen. That really if you knew their
[1:28:33] lives, you'd say, "How are they so
[1:28:34] happy?" Remember Sister Val? She she
[1:28:36] went to be with the Lord. She was up 90
[1:28:39] 90 something years old when she passed
[1:28:40] on. But when I met her, I don't know,
[1:28:42] however long it was ago, full of life,
[1:28:45] full of zeal, full of joy. Then you hear
[1:28:48] her upbringing and the and the hard life
[1:28:49] she had with her husband, all the
[1:28:51] trouble she had and all these things.
[1:28:52] You think, why on earth did that not
[1:28:54] make her bitter? I tell you what, cuz
[1:28:55] she chose to be identified not by her
[1:28:58] hard life, not by the natural things,
[1:29:01] but she was identified by the living
[1:29:02] God. And she decided, this is who I am
[1:29:05] in spite of whatever circumstance.
[1:29:07] Friends, I've been in Papa New Guinea.
[1:29:09] I've been to the rubbish dump there.
[1:29:10] I've seen people scavenging for
[1:29:12] aluminium cans just to sell to live off.
[1:29:15] They're not sad. They're happy people.
[1:29:17] They're not wo is me and victim
[1:29:19] mentality. You know, you drive up there,
[1:29:20] we were getting firewood with a pastor
[1:29:22] there. We drive up, people are waving,
[1:29:24] hello, how are you? How's things?
[1:29:25] They're not hiding their head in shame
[1:29:27] and all these things. They're happy
[1:29:29] people. They don't have this well is me
[1:29:31] victim mentality. I say, friends, if a
[1:29:33] natural person in a natural land can be
[1:29:35] like that, what about you and I?
[1:29:39] Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. What about I? What about you and
[1:29:43] I? Amen. to God. So without us they are
[1:29:47] not made complete. We are compassed
[1:29:49] about with so great a cloud of
[1:29:50] witnesses. Amen. So we got to realize
[1:29:52] that they are cheering us on because
[1:29:55] there's got to be a people that are
[1:29:57] alive cuz remember any every every
[1:29:59] generation has a has a witness has a
[1:30:03] people that know a living God. And you
[1:30:05] happen to be this generation. Amen. You
[1:30:08] weren't back in the 60s or back at Isusa
[1:30:10] Street or back in the Reformation or
[1:30:12] back there with Paul or with the Lord
[1:30:14] Jesus or No, you're here today. Amen.
[1:30:17] And so God is God is calling us to run.
[1:30:21] Amen. He doesn't want us to walk with a
[1:30:23] poor me was me mentality. He wants us to
[1:30:26] walk He wants us to walk with our heads
[1:30:27] up, our chests out. We're son and
[1:30:29] daughter of God. Amen. We're here to
[1:30:31] possess every divine promise.
[1:30:34] Amen. But there's a call. We got to lay
[1:30:35] aside every weight and sin that that uh
[1:30:37] which has so easily beset us. Now this
[1:30:41] word sin here,
[1:30:43] this is from the the Bible dictionary.
[1:30:45] It means to miss the mark. It means to
[1:30:47] it means to be mistaken. So we've got to
[1:30:50] lay aside these weights and these sins.
[1:30:54] So to miss the mark,
[1:30:57] you say, "Well, I believe," see, see the
[1:31:00] Apostle Paul here is telling us in this
[1:31:02] scripture, there's things we've got to
[1:31:04] lay aside, weights and sins, burdens. So
[1:31:07] things that aren't even sinful, but they
[1:31:09] weigh us down, we're to lay it aside.
[1:31:11] Sin, see, there's an element of sin that
[1:31:14] you must wrestle with because you're
[1:31:16] still in this body,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; right? Your sin, I mean, your soul, it's
[1:31:19] sinless, right? Because the blood of
[1:31:21] Jesus Christ has cleansed it. But you
[1:31:23] need a new body. Right? So there's an
[1:31:25] element of unbelief that you must
[1:31:27] wrestle with things that from your
[1:31:29] natural lineage that you've got to
[1:31:30] wrestle with and overcome. Okay? And so
[1:31:33] to miss the mark now it means that you
[1:31:36] can you can what are you doing? You're
[1:31:38] aiming at the wrong target to be
[1:31:40] mistaken. I trust I've got everyone's
[1:31:41] attention right now for about five
[1:31:43] minutes. Okay. Now you see but you see
[1:31:45] well but I believe the word. I believe
[1:31:47] the message. How could I ever miss the
[1:31:49] mark?
[1:31:52] What do you believe about yourself? Are
[1:31:55] you at peace with yourself?
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Of who you are?
[1:32:02] Many times we wrestle with the thought
[1:32:05] of why on earth would God ever love me,
[1:32:10] don't we? I think I got everyone's
[1:32:11] attention right because this is missing
[1:32:12] the mark. This is part of this is a sin
[1:32:14] you got to lay aside.
[1:32:16] Amen. Do you like yourself?
[1:32:20] Because what God sees in you is
[1:32:22] perfection. You are his greatest
[1:32:24] achievement. Not the universe. You. Not
[1:32:28] the nebulas and all the galaxies and not
[1:32:30] even nature and all these. It's you are
[1:32:33] his greatest achievement. God's desire.
[1:32:36] He says, "Heaven is my throne. Earth is
[1:32:38] my foottool. But where is the place of
[1:32:40] my rest?" He asked in Isaiah. That's his
[1:32:43] question. And he's actually throwing it
[1:32:45] out to the out to the humanity. Where
[1:32:47] can I rest myself?
[1:32:49] Well, God, couldn't you make a place to
[1:32:51] rest? He doesn't want to make something
[1:32:53] like just some bed to rest in. He wants
[1:32:56] a loving, surrendered, abiding heart
[1:33:00] that's sold out to him. That's the place
[1:33:03] of his rest. Right? So to have a people,
[1:33:06] can you think about it? There's in you
[1:33:09] is if you got the Holy Ghost, there's
[1:33:10] God and there's your will, right? And
[1:33:14] because of his great grace, you're
[1:33:16] intertwined now together.
[1:33:19] That's an incredible achievement.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; That's a supernatural thing for a
[1:33:24] person. Hey, we're all born. We're
[1:33:26] stubborn. We're prideful. We're
[1:33:27] arrogant. We think we know it all.
[1:33:29] Especially when we get to late teens. We
[1:33:31] think we know everything and all the,
[1:33:32] you know, but yet God in his mercy gets
[1:33:35] a hold of us and allows our will to be
[1:33:38] surrendered into his will where there's
[1:33:40] actually a true oneness
[1:33:43] where he can rest. Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I don't like me.
[1:33:49] God likes you.
[1:33:52] My parents never said a single good word
[1:33:54] about me. God said a lot of good words
[1:33:55] about you. And he knows the whole you.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just know the facade you put
[1:34:00] out to people. He knows the whole you.
[1:34:03] He knows your secret thoughts. He knows
[1:34:04] what's in your heart. You say, "Well, my
[1:34:06] heart's so bad. My thoughts are so
[1:34:07] evil." He doesn't even take that into
[1:34:09] account.
[1:34:11] He takes you. I trust that makes sense.
[1:34:13] You say, "Well, how he could never love
[1:34:15] me. I'd never amounted to nothing." And
[1:34:17] you're his greatest achievement.
[1:34:20] You've got to lay aside that weight. I
[1:34:22] say, "Lay aside that sin which is
[1:34:23] missing the mark." That's why people can
[1:34:25] be so unhappy in themselves and so not
[1:34:28] secure, happy in your own skin. It's
[1:34:30] because of especially fathers, how they
[1:34:32] treated us growing up. You know, it's
[1:34:34] such a sad thing that us as children
[1:34:37] will think of how God is based on how
[1:34:39] our father has treated us. There's like
[1:34:41] this imprinting that puts is put in our
[1:34:44] human spirit on God based on how our
[1:34:47] father was. If he was cruel and mean and
[1:34:49] judgmental and distant, you'll think
[1:34:51] God's that way. If you think he's loving
[1:34:53] and kind and lets you get away with
[1:34:55] anything, you'll think God's that way,
[1:34:59] right?
[1:35:00] God's got to give us to a right balance.
[1:35:03] Amen. We got to let God take away this
[1:35:06] false impression of who he is and let
[1:35:09] him show us who he really is.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's a that's a weight
[1:35:15] that God wants to take off you. Amen.
[1:35:18] Where God wants you to just be happy.
[1:35:20] Lord, I'm glad I'm glad you've made me
[1:35:23] me.
[1:35:25] If you can come to that place in your
[1:35:27] walk, you've just got a tremendous
[1:35:30] victory.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. where you realize God actually
[1:35:35] does love me not on what I've done
[1:35:38] because of who I am, because we're his
[1:35:41] children. Is this is this sinking in?
[1:35:44] Amen. Because many people say, "I've got
[1:35:46] to earn something. I've got to keep
[1:35:47] earning things. I've got to keep doing
[1:35:48] this." No. God doesn't love you because
[1:35:50] of what you do. It's by it's He loves
[1:35:54] you because of who you are. And your
[1:35:56] actions aren't who you are. You are who
[1:35:59] you are. are that gene seed of God he
[1:36:01] put in you before the foundation of the
[1:36:02] world.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're we're going to
[1:36:06] come to a rest. Lord, you love me.
[1:36:09] You've told me you love me. You've
[1:36:11] accepted me
[1:36:13] in spite of all I am what I've done. My
[1:36:16] even my attitude towards myself, Lord.
[1:36:18] Change it to match your attitude towards
[1:36:20] me. Because I'll tell you what, that
[1:36:22] won't make you arrogant. That won't make
[1:36:24] you proud. No, it'll make you humble and
[1:36:26] more appreciative. I'm going to give you
[1:36:27] a stability in your life that God, I'm
[1:36:29] your chosen one.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; This may have gone way a bit of a segue,
[1:36:34] but this is just where we are. You got
[1:36:35] to come to peace. Let God wrestle with
[1:36:38] that thought. Maybe you never had a good
[1:36:40] good word from your father in your life.
[1:36:43] Lay it down.
[1:36:45] This word is anointed you. The reason it
[1:36:49] is because he says when the Holy Ghost
[1:36:50] falls on someone, anoint like fills
[1:36:53] them, that's God saying, "I'm pleased
[1:36:55] with you.
[1:36:56] You're my beloved son. You're my beloved
[1:36:58] daughter.
[1:37:06] We're nearly done.
[1:37:08] Amen. Lunch is coming.
[1:37:13] See the Lord See the Lord took Peter,
[1:37:16] James, and John up Mount
[1:37:17] Transfiguration.
[1:37:19] He said, "This is my beloved son. Hear
[1:37:22] him." What did the father do if I could
[1:37:24] put it that way? What did he do? He
[1:37:26] publicly acknowledged, "I'm proud of my
[1:37:28] son." It was his adoption robing time,
[1:37:31] if I put it that way, right? The baptism
[1:37:34] of the Holy Ghost is the adoption robe.
[1:37:36] Okay? But I just want to use this
[1:37:38] illustration this way. He publicly, See,
[1:37:40] many fathers do not publicly tell their
[1:37:43] children how what they think of them in
[1:37:45] a good way. They will not actually come
[1:37:48] to say, "I'm proud of you. You're my
[1:37:51] child. I'm so happy to see you grow up."
[1:37:54] Not that they leave the house, but I
[1:37:55] want to see them come to their full. You
[1:37:57] want to see them come to their full
[1:37:58] manifestation as a person, right?
[1:38:02] Fathers, it's like it's like David and
[1:38:04] Abselon. David wept so much for Abselon
[1:38:07] in public, but there's no record of him
[1:38:09] in the Bible ever actually actually
[1:38:11] acknowledging Abselon. Abselon, I love
[1:38:13] you.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; There was always this rift. And because
[1:38:16] why? Because Jesse did not publicly
[1:38:18] acknowledge David. So the cycle came
[1:38:21] down. You say, "Well, how could that
[1:38:23] happen?" It's because you got to realize
[1:38:25] that part of your inheritance is going
[1:38:26] more than just being anointed and, you
[1:38:28] know, more than just this isolated
[1:38:30] thing. You got to realize you let that
[1:38:31] anointing reach down into your family
[1:38:33] and see what God has done to you. You
[1:38:35] got to humanly do. That's why I think
[1:38:37] it's so important we recognize these
[1:38:38] young men, these young women.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; I don't call you children anymore.
[1:38:44] You're adults.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You're growing up. It's good. I like
[1:38:49] what I see. your men, your women. We
[1:38:52] don't want to push you down.
[1:38:54] Who's with me? Parents,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; we're not here to push anyone down. We
[1:39:00] want to see everyone raise up to their
[1:39:02] God-given position. Amen. Where they
[1:39:04] will go into Gad and take their
[1:39:06] inheritance of a of a rapture and a
[1:39:07] double portion.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we could say this. You
[1:39:11] can put any of your names there. This is
[1:39:13] my beloved children. They're not
[1:39:15] children anymore. Hear ye him. Hear
[1:39:18] them. The word is in them. Let them
[1:39:20] speak it now. Let God live out of their
[1:39:22] lives. Amen. I trust maybe this is not
[1:39:25] making sense. This means a lot to me
[1:39:27] because God has with this message, I'm
[1:39:30] going to summarize this whole thing. God
[1:39:32] with this message has identified you as
[1:39:33] his child and he's not ashamed of you
[1:39:36] none. Nothing you've done is ashamed of.
[1:39:38] He's proud of you. Amen. He loves you
[1:39:41] with an everlasting love and he wants to
[1:39:43] place you as an adult son and daughter
[1:39:45] of God, not as a child. So I say, let
[1:39:49] that replicate down into our families
[1:39:51] that we can be men that stand in the
[1:39:53] gap.
[1:39:55] We can be men and women that can stand
[1:39:56] in the gap. Stand in be a hedge. Be a
[1:40:00] place of protection. Where a spirit
[1:40:02] doesn't get into any of us. Where where
[1:40:04] where a person begins to think I don't
[1:40:06] belong and I'll never amount to nothing.
[1:40:08] And if anyone's ever told you that in
[1:40:09] your life, they've been lying to you.
[1:40:10] That's a demon spirit talking to you. I
[1:40:12] tell you what, friends, you got the
[1:40:14] greatest potential of any people I know
[1:40:17] is in this room. Amen. And people may
[1:40:20] have bypassed you, but God sure hasn't
[1:40:21] bypassed you. I mean, just like David
[1:40:23] was bypassed by his brothers and his
[1:40:25] father, but God didn't bypass him. And
[1:40:27] God hasn't bypassed you. I don't care
[1:40:29] what age you're at. Amen. God's anointed
[1:40:31] you with the Holy Ghost. I mean, to
[1:40:32] bring forth kingship, amen, or
[1:40:34] queenship, I put it that way. That you
[1:40:37] will dwell in the overcomer's throne.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] So, let's go and hear it. There's sons.
[1:40:44] There's daughters. Let's have the
[1:40:45] musicians. I'm going to finish. I'm
[1:40:46] going to abruptly just pull the bus
[1:40:47] over. We've stopped.
[1:40:49] Let's have the musicians. You say,
[1:40:51] "Well, I'm I'm nothing." What does God
[1:40:54] see about you?
[1:40:56] That's why we've got to look at this.
[1:41:01] Don't be mistaken.
[1:41:04] Remember, sin is to be mistaken. Don't
[1:41:06] be mistaken about yourself.
[1:41:09] Say, "God, show me what you know of me."
[1:41:12] I was going to use the word think, but
[1:41:14] we use a human thought. No. What does
[1:41:16] God know about me? Who does he say I am?
[1:41:21] And that will be a sin that's just cast
[1:41:22] to one side.
[1:41:27] Amen.
[1:41:31] Oh boy.
[1:41:33] Amen. Let's um let's stand.
[1:41:41] I want to sing the um I want to sing our
[1:41:43] revelation song. Gates of hell you will
[1:41:46] not prevail. By the rock of revelation,
[1:41:47] my faith will stand.
[1:41:54] All that is before me will all end up
[1:41:56] behind me. When I sing that, I think
[1:41:57] that that those spirits are dead in the
[1:41:59] mud, face down behind me. That's what I
[1:42:02] think. So maybe a bit violent, but I'm
[1:42:03] violent against the enemy. Amen. That's
[1:42:06] just how I feel. Anything that's
[1:42:08] opposing me is going down. Amen. I tell
[1:42:10] you what, friends, we go into this camp.
[1:42:12] Let's go victorious already. Let's not
[1:42:14] wait for Sunday night to have a jubilee.
[1:42:16] Why not have a jubilee now? Why not have
[1:42:18] a revival leading up to camp where the
[1:42:20] word becomes more alive? Set yourself
[1:42:22] aside this coming week. Draw nigh to
[1:42:24] God. Say, "God, I have needs. God,
[1:42:26] there's people coming to camp that don't
[1:42:27] even know you. Lord, there's strangers.
[1:42:29] There's people who have never come into
[1:42:30] your presence before, God. Lord, touch
[1:42:33] them." Hallelujah. Have an expectation.
[1:42:35] And I tell you what, friends, we'll have
[1:42:36] the greatest camp that's ever struck the
[1:42:38] earth will be this one. Not because of
[1:42:40] who we are, but because of who God is.
[1:42:42] If we give him first place, we let God
[1:42:44] be God, there's nothing that he cannot
[1:42:47] do. Amen.
[1:42:51] Amen. Let's sing.
[1:42:56] I'm here for my promise.
[1:42:59] I come and believe
[1:43:03] no matter the problem.
[1:43:07] I know I'll receive
[1:43:11] I here for my healing.
[1:43:14] His word says it's mine.
[1:43:18] So all of the feelings
[1:43:22] I call you alive.
[1:43:26] I'm here for my victory.
[1:43:29] I lift up my hands.
[1:43:33] My faith is an army.
[1:43:37] Right here I'll stand.
[1:43:42] Oh, I have authority
[1:43:45] and I'm coming for what's mine.
[1:43:50] I know what I've been given.
[1:43:55] And I'm here for a fight.
[1:44:00] Yeah.
[1:44:03] Oh, gates of hell.
[1:44:07] You won't prevail.
[1:44:10] On the rock of revelation,
[1:44:14] my faith won't fail.
[1:44:19] And all that stands before me will all
[1:44:24] end up behind me. I

[1:44:33] I know who I am.

[1:44:44] of the king in my hand.

[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:07] here for my children.
[1:45:10] I'm here for my daughter.
[1:45:14] You might think you had her,
[1:45:17] but I'm coming for her.
[1:45:22] I have authority
[1:45:25] and I'm coming for what's mine.
[1:45:30] I know what I give
[1:45:35] and I'm here for a fight.
[1:45:40] Yeah.
[1:45:43] Oh, gates of hell.
[1:45:47] You won't be
[1:45:50] on the rock of revelation.

[1:50:27] bow heads in a word of prayer this
[1:50:29] morning, shall we? Amen. The question's
[1:50:31] gone out. Are there any sons? Are there
[1:50:33] any daughters? We say yes, Lord. Here we
[1:50:35] are, Lord. We're here to possess every
[1:50:37] promise, oh God. Hallelujah. Lord, you
[1:50:39] gave it to us, Lord. We want every
[1:50:41] divine promise of God, Lord, that you
[1:50:43] died for that day on Calvary. Lord,
[1:50:45] that's come out of your open word, Lord
[1:50:46] Jesus. We want it all. We want to
[1:50:48] possess it all and we're not satisfied
[1:50:50] with just a portion. We want the whole
[1:50:51] thing, my God. So, Father, in the name
[1:50:53] of Jesus Christ, I pray, dear God, that
[1:50:55] we'd push out every enemy, every spirit
[1:50:57] of unbelief, Lord, every every spirit of
[1:50:59] of skepticism, my God. Father, anything
[1:51:03] that would try and push us off a
[1:51:05] promise, Lord God, we we we rebuke in
[1:51:07] the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, house
[1:51:10] of hell, give way to the name of Jesus
[1:51:11] Christ, we're coming through, devil, get
[1:51:13] out of our way or get run over. Oh God,
[1:51:15] we love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[1:51:16] Lord, we can possess every divine
[1:51:18] promise, Lord. We can raise up and be
[1:51:20] real men, real women of God, Lord, that
[1:51:22] we, Lord, that we don't need to live
[1:51:23] with a pity party kind of an atmosphere
[1:51:25] or poor me, Lord, but we can go beyond,
[1:51:28] Lord, those things and walk with you and
[1:51:29] be positive and have a life full of
[1:51:31] faith and love, oh God. We thank you so
[1:51:33] much, Lord Jesus. You've Lord, you've
[1:51:35] charged us, Lord, to run this race, oh
[1:51:37] God, that set before us, Lord. So, we're
[1:51:39] going to look unto you, Lord, the author
[1:51:40] and finisher of our faith. We're going
[1:51:42] to look unto your word, look unto your
[1:51:43] promises, oh God, and be fixated upon
[1:51:46] them, oh God, as we run. We love you,
[1:51:48] Lord. I just want to commit everyone
[1:51:49] here, dear God, into your hands, Lord.
[1:51:51] Anyone here, Lord, who's maybe hurting
[1:51:52] from their childhood or something, dear
[1:51:55] God, I pray you just pour your anointing
[1:51:57] in there, Lord. Pour your healing virtue
[1:51:58] in, dear God. Father, they'd have such a
[1:52:00] stability in their hearts, oh God. They
[1:52:02] know who they are, Lord. They know that
[1:52:04] you love them, Lord Jesus. Lord, that
[1:52:05] they don't look at them, Lord. They
[1:52:07] Lord, you don't look at them how maybe
[1:52:09] their parents did, Lord Jesus. You look
[1:52:11] at them with an unfailing love because
[1:52:13] they are part of you. Granted, dear God,
[1:52:16] we love you, Lord. We commit the service
[1:52:17] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:52:20] Amen.
[1:52:22] Amen. God bless you, friends. Amen. Turn
[1:52:24] the service to you, bro. You want to
[1:52:25] sing a couple of songs or whatever you

[1:55:58] And if I look and it seems like it's
