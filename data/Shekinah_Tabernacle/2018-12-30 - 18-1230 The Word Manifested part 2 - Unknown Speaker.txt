going to have watch night out it out at the lease and it's going to we're going to start at 5:30 with a good old New Zealand barbecue amen I mean we're the permitting of course I mean if not then we'll be here at 8:30 amen and then also we'll have no because we're having watch night we'll have no Wednesday night service this week I mean so god bless you all let's turn to the book of Corinthians first Corinthians chapter 2 a couple of places like to read this morning first Corinthians 2 and verses 6 down to verse 16 and then we're going to go to the book of Philemon so 1st Corinthians 2 and 6 it says howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that a spiritual judges all things yet himself as judged of no man for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen and let's go to Philemon we're going to read verses so it's only one chapter we're going to read verses 5 to 2:7 they means this is here and and Philemon verses 5 to 7 it says now hearing of thy love and faith which thou has towards the Lord Jesus and towards All Saints that the communication of thy faith may become a fiction by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus if we have great joy and consolation and thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by the brother amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to continue on from from last Sunday speaking about the word manifested and we have read here you know we yeah we read here and Philemon I want to take this mainly as a as a thought but you know see is that the communication of their faith may become a fictional by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so we have to come to a place where we you know if we want our faith the other communication of our faith to become a fictional or the offer to become powerful we have to acknowledge or to come to a full understanding of every good thing that's within us which is in Christ Jesus so you know I believe that we're living in a day where the it is the you know it is the revealing of the manifestation of the sons of God this is an adoption Ages as where the bride comes to her position in Christ you know where it's more than just looking for a promise to come but we actually obtain the promise right so you know we so we want out you know who wants their faith to be effectual who are your faith to be powerful you know to manifest itself so in order to do that we must acknowledge and and that would acknowledge to be which is which means recognition that is to come to fooled discernment or full acknowledgment of what sin you see so we must come to a full recognition of what is in you and we know that in our humanity there's no good thing you know this is not what for your what has been written to fill them on here he's not being told to look at your own humanity your your carnal nature and look at what's good that but what's in you that is good by Jesus Christ being in you right so because we know brother perhaps is a deity is not in heaven it's in you rights and I see everything that's in Christ all that God poured into crises poured into you right so now so we need to look at what is in us and we must recognize what's in us and we have to in order for our faith to be official to be powerful we must acknowledge every good thing that's in you in Christ Jesus right this is very important because we are knotted the bride is not downtrodden right we're not just scraping by we're overcoming why the bride is called to overcome it's not to him that survives will I sit will they sit on my throne as I've set my Father's throne as to them that overcomes but and we are more than conquerors through Christ that loved us more than conquerors not just getting buyers not a close-run thing we're going to walk out of this world victorious we're gonna walk out world overcoming then the devil will have zero on the scoreboard and will win right so now we need to acknowledge what is within us and we should end and the more you should see Christ in you the more you should worship Him and the more thankful for what he's done for you right if we really if the bride really new really come to a full recognition of what God has done for you would be on our knees screaming thanking God every day it would not make us proud it would not make us arrogant it would make us more humble yielded thankful people because we know it is not our work we are not our own work right we're not here to to establish her own selves upon the earth but God would live that he would manifest himself he would there be no hindrance there be nothing stopping you know him living and and you know I didn't really wrap it all up on your last Sunday but I said you know you know you shouldn't have any walls between you and God and you shouldn't have walls with you in you and your parents I see you know sometimes we can have because of bad relationships we can put up walls but you know don't don't apply the same relationship you have with your dad as you have work with God as they you shouldn't have walls between you and your parents no matter how they've treated you right because remember complex our wall while he hinders God living out of years it doesn't hinder the other person is tenders God living out of you right so you know we shouldn't have a wall against anyone all right so we need to you know it says in first John four and four year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that's in you that he that is in the world so he says here you have overcome them the victories already won right we just need to enjoy it I mean so now we have to come to a and I believe we're living in a season where you know brother Branham would say and in crisis the mystery of God revealed he says so it's Christ expressing himself in the individual with these intellectual with he doesn't know as ABC's half the Apostles didn't know that's right but they knowed Christ they never taken heat to Peter and John knowing that they came out of some seminary they said they have taken heat and noticed that they had been with Christ whether healed the lame man see at the gate they knowed they'd been with Christ and the new birth is a revelation Christ our God has revealed you this great mystery it's a new birth now that's what you are going to do I mean now what are you going to do when you get all that group together with the revelation is imperfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest he says Oh of the church only knew its position at will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is right so you know so so he's so he's saying if the church only knew its position not if the church would come to that position but it would only if it only knew its position and it will one day know there so that one day has to come I believe we're living in that one day we're living in the season where it's not in the future but its present right so now so when we know our position in Christ what he has done for us right then the rapture will go when it knows what it is right and we know the bride is part of the bridegroom she is the Word made flesh right so this has to go from here and it has two anchor down into our souls amen he says in Revelations chapter 1 1960 says he says now my church will get cut Lucy washed us and loosed us from our denominations in his own blood and has made us free so we can think for ourselves do for ourselves talk for ourselves act for our self well if I went back and told the pastor I had to be rebaptised he would what about it you're free this is a revelation you know all all right you're free have you been sprinkled with look with a little salt shake like this in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost is a pool sitting here ready this morning with water at sea yes sir it's not right so you're not bound anymore you're free but maybe you don't know it but let me tell you this morning the Bible said is loosed us from our sins our unbelief that we might receive the revelation of Jesus Christ go away free right have to take what any Church is about it take what God says about it here's this revelation revealing who he is as always believed that God was the father a long white beard white here the son was a middle-aged man and the Holy Ghost was a mascot boy brother it's paganism it's pagan if you believe in three gods the very first commandment what is the first commandment he or Israel I'm the Lord your God is one God that's it he's one God not three gods he lived in three officers Amen base but you know so he said now you're free but maybe you just don't know it if you have to come to realization we have real Liberty we have freedom in Christ we're actually free from the bondage of unbelief how our sin nature we are born with we don't carry that no more if you've been born again what we have been made free but maybe we don't know it so we're going to come to a full recognition that we're free hallelujah not just a little bit free we're completely free if he has loosed us by his blood I mean that we are loosed we are free hallelujah there's been a full jail break hallelujah we're out amen we're free now so as I saying that now we've come to eight we've come to a cease and we're where this is an adoption season where now we yeah yeah let's just go to Luke chapter 15 I just want to go through a few things but this is the story and and I trust you all know it well of the of the prodigal son now we read this here and and well let's just read it because I trust when you read such stories you you can see yourself in the scripture hallelujah and so we're just going to jump partway through through here and he sees from we're just going to read from verse 17 I mean say I mean when you're there he says and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger and I'll arise and go to my father's hand and father I've sinned against heaven and before thee and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him had compassion ran and fell on as Dickon kissed him and his son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said unto his servants bring forth the best robe put it on him and put on a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it let us eat and let us eat and be merry for thy for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost that is found and they began to be merry so now we so the prodigal son he was restored he was redeemed back to his rightful position by his father as the father's doing right here is the one that decreed remember the prodigal son he had in his heart I'm not worried because the son anymore just be a servant but the father did not want his son to remain a servant he wanted him to be fully restored or edie back to what he was before he left father's house right so he was he was redeemed restored back to his rightful position in the family right and this was shown by by he he received thee you know he received thee the best robe right wasn't just a robe was just a change in raiment that was the best one right and we know that we're living in an hour where we're where we have come to the marriage of the Lamb right there's a people upon the earth that have been United with heavenly bridegroom right we're living in marriage season living a time with is a union has taken place a minute Caesar and his wife has made herself ready and to her she was grounded should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints right so that is the best robe I mean the righteousness of saints is the best room right so so he was a rate in the best robe and not only that but but a ring was put on his finger now we know in the scripture and it's the same in like the medieval times you know when a king would sign something at the law he'd take his ring which had his coat of arms I'd have put it in the wax and seal it on the bottom of that of that document saying this is me all of my authorities behind this piece of writing hallelujah and so now he's been given the rope so he's as righteous as the father is righteous I mean we are as righteous as God is righteous right we're not less righteous than him and the bride is as righteous as he is righteous we're as holy as Jesus is holy amen I fear if we're being redeemed we join here's with Christ we've been lifted up to his safe equal position with him I'm talking about every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus you had to acknowledge it hallelujah so now so so he was given a ring and that ring we know in the scripture where it says that you know you know the ring always carries the Kings Authority and we see this in the book of Esther after Esther has you know Heyman's scheme has been exposed he's been hung on his own gallows but then but then after that the the ring that was given to Haman now is placed in eastern Mordecai's hands and then now they have the right to to write whatever they wish amen and to seal it with the king seal that it's exactly the same as if the king wrote it now personally I mean and signed up with his own seal so it's the same as as as ister was writing that it was exactly the same as if the king was writing it right so now so it sees an Esther eight and seven assists in king of has receipt on the east of the Queen and to Mordecai the Jew well hold I have given s to the house of Haman and and him they have hanged upon the gallows because they because he laid his hands of on the juice he says right he also for the juice as it like ahthe you in the King's name and seal it with the King's ring for the writing which is written in the King's name and sealed with the King's ring may no man reverse police so now they received the authority whatever you write he says just write it seal it with my ring publish it abroad hallelujah so now it's the wind from a transition where she was a wish you was a orphan and Mordecai's house and then she became the queen but now she exeed was given the authority to exercise everything the Queen hat yo could could exercise you following me so because we're where she was afraid to go and before the king right there wasn't too much longer after that where the king said whatever you say write it down seal it and see it at home and this is the position that Easter was placed in it's the same thing with the Bride of Christ we're gonna understand that we've been given the signet ring of God holy that we have authority in the kingdom not the way greater than him but his will must be manifested upon the earth I mean that's why I read we have the mind of Christ yo yeah we're brother EV sees that the bride knows what he wants done with his word and because the same - and him as in you right sir so what he does with his word you know what he wants done because it's a - a news right it's not a different mind we don't have a different mind and different opinion we have his opinion his mind right so what has attitude we have the same attitude I mean his heart towards your the lost we have the same heart right his heart towards the devil we have the same height as well right hallelujah I mean so you know everything he is his nature we received that nature we have we are partakers of the divine nature yes and that's why I trust when you look look at yourself and look where you've come from you should be able to see the nature I once had on no longer have I may still be living in this list but my hostas are when it boils down I mean what what you love I love what unit tastes itit it I can't help but I've just been Reaper bread I've been rewired I can't I can't change myself hallelujah that's why when the Apostle Paul you know let's go to Holly let's go to first Corinthians shall we first Corinthians 13 amen you know it's amazing it's amazing when you can look into the scripture and you read and you begin to find out the life that you've just read about has already been in you right it's amazing isn't it you know it's like yeah I think it was your Peter Peter and the Apostle Paul after how many years Paul was preaching I don't know off the top of my head but they came together they found it they are preaching exactly the same thing right so maybe Peter could put it in the scripture like Paul could but the same things he taught though teaching exactly the same thing right and so you know and so you can see where yeah you know because really what it is is you burst into the kingdom and you know your and brother Brahim sinners like you are in turn to a great arcade everything belongs to you you don't know exactly what's on the top shelf in the back aisle but it's for you right and you begin to fighter as you go through the scripture that the life that's in you right yeah you yeah it's living and then you begin to find out actually it's in here because the same spirit that wrote the word is in you right it's like the book of Ephesians you know they've been birthed into the kingdom they have the Holy Ghost is sealed to the day of their Redemption then the Apostle Paul begins to tell them Christ's position and their position in Christ and how they must withstand the enemy and and and and with it going right so they're already in the kingdom but they are the Apostle Paul says no this is your position in crisis is what he's done for you and now you're going to grow into the fullness of statue of the perfect man how look so you know isn't anyway first Christmas xxx amen let's read from verse four he says in charity divine love suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up now you should be able to I trust when when we you know when this is being read there's something and you says this is in me right this is the section of the nature I receive this is not the nature I had but there's the nature I have received when I truly met the Lord right does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice us rejoice us not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall see through there'll be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but then that which is perfect is come then that which is part shall be done away then when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as also I am known now this is the day we're living in right that we should know as we are knowing and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity I mean say you can see here you know when when you know when the Apostle Paul is describing charity and how it manifests it's not just something nice to put on the fridge I mean you should see it in your life right you should see this manifested because the words to put on flesh right so you should see that you know in you that you beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and we know hope and the Scriptures actually expectation it's not a stab in the dark hope there's actually expectation I mean so it's really you're expecting all things hallelujah and jerath all things Amen does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Elias I trust that that mind is in you Amen to know so so the protocol son was redeemed by the father and he was placed back to his rightful position in the family now this was done because the son had to be restored back so he could run his father's business right hey yo he wasn't given a robe and a ring just to float along and and and live in the family home but the father wanted him back in his rightful position that the son could operate his father's business the same way the father would yes right it's the same thing with us you know we are being called we have been redeemed for a purpose right and nothing the devil cannot take you alive until your purpose is done what nothing can stop the devil cannot take your life doesn't matter how sick you may be how bad you may feel the devil can't take you until God has finished with you upon the earth hallelujah so we could I mean we can just say and I believe the devil can't take us until God has done hallelujah this isn't Feast of the trumpets this is now what is it done the cunningness is he said he cometh in like flatteries and what has he done he's bringing the price and ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of Antichrist upon both him bringing them to the slaughter just like just like they did in there and sorry just like they did the other in an hour to call a bride how loose the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon denominations upon the bride but here you'd get at the bride will not go through that time speak of the Great Tribulation right the Bible says not the church will but not the bride see his ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has to go through the persecute persecution for the perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ prefix the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace with her she's found grace with him he engages to her and if there's anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her head his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so does on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but as grace holds us through it lookie how many lost and blind how many sinners was there in the world there I got saved God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose however you think about how many people how many billions upon the earth the day you met him he met you but he did it for a reason right he didn't just do it just to give you a religious it you're a religious way of being but he saved you he called you he spoke to you he revealed his word to you for a purpose right that you had manifest whatever path the word is you had manifested right whatever part of the body you're called to be in right so now the son was redeemed back to his rifle position and he was done that he was he was redeemed by the father that he could take over the father's business right that we're brother Brahim says when her son has adopted into the family that his name on the check is as good as the father's right so his name his name on the check is exactly the same as if the father wrote the check right because they have the same mind right they have the same ambition hallelujah so now here we are saying that we are not you know we are saved for a purpose we need to find what their purpose is amen to know and so so here we are we you know we have the robe we're ready arrayed right we already had the robe fine linen clean and white the righteous of saints we're right right we don't get the right there we get the robe here I mean we we have the adoption Road right we have the ring that's why your we shouldn't shrink back for the devil so we should we should use our god-given Authority we may not have the power but we have the authority just like a policeman on the street he gave me the little bitty a smallest man I mean but those trucks have to stop you know for him when he goes on the street because all the city is as behind that policeman I mean he doesn't have the power to stop it but he has the authority I mean usually going to show the devil you're bad you believer and say push back devil get off the street oh Jesus Christ get out of here and he has to listen to you that's amazing how the devil you know he made humans fall he made humanity fall but then God redeems us amen and then the devil thinks you know he doesn't you know he doesn't want to listen to God he says I'll do it my way and then because humanity to fall and then God takes this human this this fallen humanity redeems it but we're still in these fallen bodies and then now a voice that once Parker Singh and glorified the devil those same lips tell the devil way to go say looks actually cast evil out the same lips bring God down maybe the same lips bring Redemption to others less aimless bring the Holy Ghost oh my gosh hallelujah I'm glad it's that way don't you and the devil has to obey your voice even the devil has to by the bride's voice hallelujah that's not now poor mr. devil could you please in the area will this be convenient for you no kick him out what up with Satan we here to Tormentum and in these kind of boom I mean why why not give him more sleepless nights I'd never be sleepy you know what I mean we mother stretch them out holy he should be happy to see you scarred I'm glad those people are gone now I can really do what I wanted ish amen now we understand that we do not become sons by the new birth right we do not we do not become part of God's family by the new birth but we are born again because we are sons right says in Galatians now I'm just men we're just going through a few things you've got to acknowledge all the good things in you in Christ Jesus right hallelujah you know it's like you know it's like someone who wants to find gold you know they may look at a hill and we look at the same hill and and and we say well there's no real value in that mountain but they know because of their training and the exploration they know Gold's there yeah right and because they see the gold under there and a lot of times you're going to move a lot of rock to get a bit of gold it takes a lot of effort but but a miner knows I to get that gold there's value in that goal all of the labor and the effort is worth it I mean to get the gold doesn't matter how much of the rock you got to move how much machinery got to buy whatever you gonna do they know it's there and they want to get it right and it's the same thing with you we're a bunch of rubble right but there's gold in you right there's gold in you I mean cuz we for this is we have we have a jean seat from before the foundation of the world that's there so there's gold there right there's gold right and now the great miner comes along our Lord Jesus and looks in you and says it's worth it that's why when he died on Calvary right he's it's worth because I want to get my gold I want to get parts of me I want to refine them on and bring them out hallelujah amen sorry because he sees Valley on you he saw value you may not see much value in yourself the devil sure doesn't think there's anything worthy in you right he just thinks you're a bunch of cannon fodder or slaves or whatever it is but God sees part of himself God sees us bright God sees us a lik lady arrayed in a Zemin you're made in His image hallelujah so you know sometimes we're gonna look at ourselves and say well Lord you you saw some value and me and it's what you see in me that matters it's not what I see it's what you see yeah amen holy I'm glad he saw something in me now I say this is Galatians 4 and 1 now I say that the ear as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world for in the fullness of the time was come God sent forth the son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive adoption of sons now we know adoption and the Bible's the placing of a son placing on the son and a family right it's not it's not bringing someone into your family that's not a blood relative right it's not one of your children you know it's not like going to China getting a Chinese baby bring it to the family writing some paperwork and saying now you're part of the family no it's the placing of a child that's been born into the family rights and now so that we might receive the adoption or the placing of sons and because he our sons because he our sons right not because you became sons but because he are I trust us means something to you and because you are sons God has set forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father I mean on my father my father you come to realize you know who your father really is not just your natural father but your heavenly father hallelujah and if you know who your father is you begin to conduct yourself differently because you know who your father is hallelujah wherefore there are no more a servant but a sudden of a son then an heir of God through Christ hallelujah so now if so that's why the message you heard the voice behind the voice what you heard that voice a supernatural voice is because God is speaking to you you're my son you my daughter I don't want you to be a servant now I want you to be a child in my kingdom I want you to be placed in the family hallelujah that way no more no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ oh yeah Amen so this is the hour where we're living in the adopts this is an adoption age this is where everything comes to its position yes right the devil comes to his position of godless evil age the church come to us position right here but the bride comes to her position and that's the main thing we should be focusing on amen you know because God ultimately the real time peace upon the earth is the bride we know God sees as roles you know Israel is God's timepiece the Prophet said it but God's waiting for us to come to our place right he's waiting for us and when we come to our place in the rapture we'll go when the church knows what it is then the rapture will go so it's very important we know who we are amen now the scripture tells us because sometimes you know we can look at this and say well will I ever make it to my placing in the kingdom well seasoned Ephesians 1 and 5 he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace your and here made us accepted in the beloved so we are predestinated unto the placing onto the adoption of children right we have our destiny as predetermined yes that's our final resting place thats our in destination upon this earth as we are placed in the body of Christ as a joint ear hallelujah Amen glory to God now the scripture also tells us you know a trust you don't mind all the reading but it says in Romans 8 that the that the creation is groaning it's under it's under expectation for the manifestation of the sons of God so the creation is under expectation amen waiting for the manifestation or the revealing that word manifestation is the revealing so it's waiting this world is waiting for you to come to your place it's under expectation it means to not just we're under expectation for a rapture and gods under expectation nature's under expectations Amy I don't know how nature thinks but it's obviously groaning I mean how the world is being pulled upon destroyed and polluted there must be a burden of nature when are we going to be delivered of this holiest when yes why brother brems in Colorado he speaks a storm out of existence and the deer come out of the bush I mean maybe they were there saying Adam is this you is this you Adam have you been redeemed hallelujah I don't know but you know maybe oh but this world is under expectation waiting for the revealing of the sons of God and that's what this message does it reveals sons and daughters of God hallelujah amen for the creature for the creation was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who has subjected the same and hope because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pain until now and not only they but ourselves which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body amen now we're just going to go on to touch something but he says here and so so this is from the church age book chapter 1 he says now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows that how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time that he has cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she'll be an invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thought of today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell could not prevail against us but we will prevail over them and that's why I say we should have a burden for revelation like this world doesn't want you to dig into the word this world does not want you to dig into the riches of Christ right because we read through in the beginning the spirit just a deep thing right so we and and the devil that's why the devil he hates revelation right but he hates that revelation and you rights is not just a bunch of knowledge yo-yo he hates the word being revealed to a people that's what he hates so hates that we in Revelation puts on flesh right where it's more than affirmation becomes a reality he cannot stand that because he knows when when when when you know the word becomes a revelation he'll be defeated because maybe the scripture doesn't only just reveal Jesus Christ it reveals you right and if you know who you are in him then you'll be then you'll be victorious lujah he says also if you were you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself and the church and his works in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't just take an ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from God and will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the Spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know so you see that's only revealed to a spiritual group of people holy holy are you saying that's not me to the others why so I'm just glad I want a husband God depends which side you're looking at right so we'll take an operation of the Holy Ghost amen in order for it to be revealed and it will require the ability to hear from God this is not the prophet hearing from God that's you why cuz it's going to become a living reality to you I mean so now we know the book of Revelation is the bride's book hallelujah that's our book right but now once you just do now I heard brother Duane awesome meeting this free people to go but deeper into it he's now brother brems he has five things here right he says so the devil cannot stand it he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church that's the first one and what years that's a sick of one watch he stands well that's the third one and she can do the greater works that's the fourth one she will be an invincible army and if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church that's the fifth one and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist but Satan will be powerless before her right so we need to understand the true revelation of the true church right and what she is it's important you know what you are right you're not from this earth you're from heaven are you just going through this but a Heki of time back injury hallelujah and so and what she stands for we need to know what we stand for and that she can do the greater works right we're living in the age of the greater works right she will be an invincible army if she get if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her right so no we understand you know as as brother Brahim says in the unveiling of God when he when he went into a there was a steel manufacturing place and at the end of the day you know everyone got off the floor they swept all of their trimmings and stuff from there you know they're doing their lathes work you know and then it all stepped away you know slipped it onto the floor they push a button the magnet pulled it up and they've got taken over and it got melted over it got made over again to whatever they're making raw material it's it's like trimmings that fell off the Bible Bible Christians right so he's saying that the your the the believers are like trimmings of the word that have fallen off upon the hallelujah so now you've got to really come to it you know you know your he tells these stories they're not just nice stories it's great dip from these stories he's trying to get you to see speaking about a roundabout way he's trying to get you to see now you're out of this world what you're actually part of the scripture I mean you know just someone who is here just to be a bystander or you know just just stand on the grandstand and cheer someone on even to find out you become the prophecy but you become the word right it's just like the two on the way to Emmaus during the Resurrection season they didn't know they were part of that resurrection season they had to go to the upper room right there was part of the resurrections right so they're walking with Jesus Jesus opened the word for six hours there has been within them as he spoke maybe but he was trying to get them to see all the scripture that was fulfilled in their day right that not only was he the resurrection but they were part of that resurrection right so they the fullness of that wasn't just now they there were there in some class you mean you know they were just walking with them that he would tell them stuff about just him right he he had to open the scripture to see without living the day now now living right but then they had to not only say well that was for home but then to go in the upper room and become part of that resurrection and that's why the Lord opened the scripture to them that they would understand their part of his resurrection but the part of hermas he raised their race hallelujah right there once did interest you know did and sins and trespasses they became a life oh and it's the same thing now we're brother Brahim speaks and you know you know he uses Luke 24 mondo beads to make clear by prophecy a saying that's a prophecy right he's saying but if as a prophecy he's going to be a fulfillment right so now here and then and then he's here he's saying well Jesus is here my ministry is declare that he is here right he's here in Word form right and they're now and in the scripture comes open and it means a lot to us when he goes to Genesis 18 it doesn't mean a lot to other people means a lot to us it means a lot when he opens to the woman of the world and see it now it's just like that time and history's repeating 7 and I'll turn my back like Sarah was behind Ella him you know in the 10th I'll turn my back and all the same what's in the heart right because he's placing you in the scripture he's placing what the Lord is doing but he's placing you right there you had come to an understanding it's not just a prophet discerning the heart I mean but there's a word has come that those people will be changed just like Sarah was changed after their visitation she was changed she could have the promised son hallelujah and now here we are we have been changed alright we've received a new birth we're being born again maybe then we can meet the promised son in the air now these bodies will be changed right oh yeah maybe it's a no he's so that's why I went with it on the way to Emmaus that they would come to an understanding they're part of the fulfillment of the word and their day right that's the same thing God comes among us the message is more than just preaching or supernatural ministry but Jesus Christ revealing himself to you right and then you begin to understand your part of the fulfillment of Malachi 4 right because they said I will send to you who's used who's I God who's you and me Elijah the Prophet wasn't it turned my heart back to the original faith hallelujah all ready go you find your part of the scripture you you say well my name is not in the Bible but what I'll do is in the Bible write hallelujah glory to God Amen so now the true revelation of the true church the true church is part of him right this is not a larger just a gathering you know the message isn't just to make a church the message is actually to gather God's bride yeah there's attributes together and one redeemed body right that's the true church that the true revelation of true church just like Paul says in 1st Corinthians 11 you know how many are sick and weak among you you know because they didn't discern the Lord's body so we have to have spiritual discernment when we look at each other see I see the word in flesh I see part of them I see mrs. Jesus Christ why that's discerning the Lord's body and what she is yeah it's very easy to say we're we have brother Berenices let's just find it over here and the rising of the Sun he says no matter how much the dynamics proved to be right it's got to be a dynamic to make it work and that's what he proved hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shake it into life rise again roll them roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead till the Sun City was dead the moon shed he was dead the star City was did all they just said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he's not only the mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all revelation any others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it is in the bride because she is the flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power is power she is him as man and woman are one and a woman has taken from a side she was tight I'm she had taken a spirit and feminist spirit from him the flesh from a side made both mechanic and dynamic the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanic and dynamics until the church or the people all these Easter Bunny ceremonies big churches finery will fail and pass away until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I've given him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll race him again in the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics he says you can scream and shout jump up and down all you want to deny this were word it won't do any good you're just cranky around the Pistons that the sparks got the fire but no guests in the fire I bye hallelujah Amen so now right you know with the bride has the mechanics in the dynamics the bride is the whole package right we're not lacking anything our Lord hasn't left us as a widow with nothing we lack have no thing I mean we have all things we need in his word hallelujah so we can just rejoice but when he says that she is him that's just three words but it means a whole bunch Amen when you you know we got to understand what we are we're part of her right we're not something he's just yo you know we know just someone who's just picked up somewhere but we're part of me see is all that the father has given me will come to me and all that comes me all no wise cast out hallelujah so I'm glad amen now what do we stand for we stand for the faith once delivered to the Saints we stand for God dwelling in a people brought this well this missus does it produces Christ and a people the word the fullness of the word is manifested in a multi-member body right as the scripture says until he until you're we're that would be filled with the very fullness of God's everything he is will be filled with it right all of us nature's character everything he is not just a portion like in previous ages but the fullness enter people Amen brother Brahim says now he sees in the feasts of the trumpets he sees that the holy spirit has been bound by these dominant denominational rivers for almost 2,000 years but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ Himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it she sees of this because the pure Word of God releases the Spirit of God upon the people right well hallelujah so now this so the Holy Ghost that was bound by the Creed and dog was of man that's been done away with has been loosed by the entire message right as John the Baptist he was authenticated by Jesus coming and being baptized by him he was the vindication of his ministry right hallelujah and if that was the first coming as John the Baptist for around the first come here Christ saw the Ministry of brother brand will forerun the second coming so what is the authentication of his ministry is that the Lamb of God was introducing God has and his people right they see us indication that God has put on flesh again enough evil that is the proof of the message yes that is the proof it's not about clothes and bridges and whatever more the proof of them remember the message is God and his people right because if it's the pure Word of God it looses the Holy Ghost upon the people and the Holy Ghost comes and dwells in them amen and that's what this message is done the Holy Ghost is being loosed hallelujah that we're not looking for something else to come it's come it's already here the were discovered salutes the Holy Ghost hallelujah that's why now there's no hindrance there's nothing to stop it and then there's no channel blocks I mean everything's come open that he can just pour himself out hallelujah I'm so glad that it's all right I happen to believe it the word is loosed right the Holy Ghost is being loosed upon us hallelujah I mean you see John came introduced Jesus that produced a book of Acts right I produced a true Pentecost which which produced a book of Acts and when we have Malachi 4 come introduce Jesus Christ the Living Word brought us to a true Pentecost true Pentecost makes call coming to our little people and it's now writing a book of Acts hallelujah I'm in it history repeats itself what quite wonderfully amen and that she can do the greater works amen we are called to do the greater works that's why we can't as I see it but in the beginning don't shrink back to the devil right but we can do the greater works amen and she will be an invincible army now as I've said in the past an invincible army has to be have to have combat experience those on the parade ground and shiny armor they've never tested those weapons they just march around the square looking fancy right but those who are being battered and beaten and bruised and your goth are a few battles and their armors been dent then said they're proved those weapons and they've come out victorious twice in order to be invincible you have to go through battle hallelujah amen and if they can get a true revelation and now I've gone to these things that are in a greater way later perhaps but if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern them withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her now the Antichrist spirit wants to take the promise of the day away from the people right he wants to make them formal cold and powerless and indifferent that's the end of guys spirit takes a promise away puts it on someone else is why maybe we'll say oh if only brother Branham was here did everything would be fine no he's not here the same spirit is here the mighty angel is here what God didn't want us to admire a prophet he won't rest admire him and his - manifesting that's what he wanted right people say well and any people look for a turn ministry no it's here and the bride this is the return ministry on the problem but in the bride right so we don't want to look for the whale from the future well for the past God's here he's manifesting his word here he's alive here hallelujah now amen so we have to I'll just finish with the scripture seasoned Ephesians three says and to make and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery that word Fellowship is actually the same word we ready to fill them on communication see what the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord and whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so now we've come to a time where all the principalities and powers and him any places may be known by the church why we're living in that time we're not looking for it to come we're here you know it's like you know you know what brother bærum who used the illustration of I think it was Benjamin Franklin he knew electricity yo he saw lightning he thought there must be some way to harness it and he got a kite and he put a key on the end just blow the car and he put it up into a storm and then and then the lightning hit the key and came down to whatever did he says I've got it I've got it he had no idea what he had and he had no idea how to put it in action it was just a big flash of light and it looked exciting it was more than what they had before that and he's trying to tap into something my thought came but he came a price at a time where someone who had the knowledge could not only your look at electricity but could harness it and it was innocent whoever made the light bulb he said now I've got it right now I've got what Franklin had but now it's bill to be harnessed and you right and now we've seen of this being powers they've been available yo to the church Peter costed I've got it I've got it and they had it I didn't really know what they had I believe it took an entire profit to come up in the word they would really see what we have and how it works and what it does hallelujah I mean so that's why I believe we should dig into the storehouse of God's Word what what is this electricity do it doesn't run out another flaw fuse I mean that doesn't run our battery power and can do all things yes I believe we should dig into the scripture search out the deep things of God what would you have me know reveal your glory because the view reveals us word to you all you can do is pray sir Oh even does worship her hallelujah because we know all true worship is based on Revelation hello I mean queered the musicians please let's go to New Year digging in go be a prospect during God's Word hallelujah living in the time of adoption amen you say but there's nothing good at me well if the Lord's in you
