[5:05] says
[5:06] here, Amen. I'm going to speak on a kind
[5:09] of a I just pray that I'm not
[5:12] misunderstood today. You may think,
[5:14] "What are you going to talk about?"
[5:15] Well, we'll see. But um then came to
[5:18] Jesus um scribes and Pharisees which
[5:21] were of Jerusalem, saying, "Why do thy
[5:24] disciples transgress the trai the
[5:26] tradition of the elders? For they wash
[5:28] not their hands when they eat bread?"
[5:30] But he answered and said unto them, Why
[5:32] do ye also transgress the commandment of
[5:34] God by your
[5:37] tradition? So I was just going to read
[5:39] those portions of script. Let's let's
[5:41] pray this morning, shall we? Amen. If
[5:43] you ever need, you just want to slip
[5:44] your hand, Lord. Fill my cup, touch my
[5:46] life, Lord. Fill me with your Holy
[5:47] Spirit, Lord. Do a work in my life,
[5:49] Lord. Gracious Father, as we bow our
[5:51] heads this morning, we're so thankful we
[5:53] can gather in this place, Lord, under
[5:55] your great presence. And we I ask,
[5:57] Father, may you anoint every life, Lord,
[5:59] today, dear God. May you take control of
[6:00] every spirit, Lord Jesus. May you come
[6:03] and meet our needs. Fill us with your
[6:04] Holy Ghost, Lord. Save the lost. Heal
[6:06] the sick. Father, open the eyes of the
[6:09] Lord, of the blind, Lord Jesus. have
[6:10] your way in our midst. And those who may
[6:12] be streaming, Lord, I don't know who
[6:13] they are exactly, but Father, be their
[6:15] abundant portion, too. Lord, we've read
[6:17] your word, but we as always need you,
[6:19] the author, the great one who pinned it
[6:21] down, Lord, through man. Lord, you'd
[6:23] come and speak it to our lives, Lord.
[6:25] Father, may you have preeminence, Lord.
[6:26] We just plead your blood over our lives
[6:28] today, Lord, over this congregation of
[6:30] people, Lord, that you'd come and be
[6:32] exalted among us, Lord. We love you,
[6:34] Lord. We thank you for this day in Jesus
[6:36] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. and you
[6:39] can have your seats this morning. So, I
[6:41] want to speak about uh compensating for
[6:43] inner problems. Now, this may be uh
[6:46] we're just going to go on a journey
[6:47] through the scripture. Okay? So, um when
[6:50] Jesus came the first time, the
[6:53] conditions of the church were the same
[6:55] conditions he would find in the end
[6:57] time. So, we can look into what the
[6:59] church was doing in his day. And I can
[7:02] say well from my uh how I feel about it
[7:06] is is is the is the Jewish world was in
[7:08] a ladyan condition back then when Jesus
[7:11] came the first time and the church world
[7:14] or the world is in a lady condition
[7:16] today when he comes back the second
[7:18] time. So if we look into the uh the
[7:22] conditions that the Jews were in uh in
[7:25] the in the time when he first came we
[7:27] can see that history repeats itself. Now
[7:30] I want to bring this in home. Okay, I'm
[7:32] not talking about denomination here. I'm
[7:33] not talking about those in the world.
[7:35] I'm talking about us because the really
[7:37] question that I've been I've been
[7:38] pondering about this very deeply is you
[7:40] know the reason I call it compensating
[7:42] for inner problems is people compensate
[7:45] because something within them is not
[7:47] right and they will do different things
[7:50] to compensate for that lack or that that
[7:52] thing that's missing and and because
[7:55] really God wants to deal with our
[7:56] hearts, right? He's not even really
[7:58] necessarily interested in the outside.
[8:00] The in outside will take care of itself
[8:02] when the inside is fine. Right? So, so
[8:04] he's interested in our hearts and really
[8:06] that's what he wants to speak to. That's
[8:08] what he wants to deal with. And you see,
[8:10] but the you know, if we look
[8:12] into we look into this scene here. I
[8:15] just want to I just want to read this
[8:16] quote here from the infallible proof of
[8:18] the resurrection. Um so this is the
[8:20] woman at the well saying, "Now we're
[8:21] taught to believe that when the Messiah
[8:22] cometh, he'll tell us these things.
[8:24] He'll tell us all these things when
[8:26] Messiah cometh. But by you telling me
[8:28] where my trouble was, you must be a
[8:30] prophet. But when Messiah cometh, he
[8:32] will tell us all things. Jesus said,
[8:34] "I'm he that speaks to you." That was
[8:36] Jesus yesterday. If he's the same, he's
[8:39] the same today. So she ran to the city
[8:40] and said, "Come see a man who told me
[8:42] the things that I ever did. Isn't this
[8:44] the very Messiah?" In other words, it
[8:46] was the sign of the Messiah. in their
[8:48] cold intellectual theologies they got
[8:50] away from the true teaching of the Bible
[8:52] to look for those things and history
[8:54] repeats itself and prophecy is usually
[8:57] compound meanings you know what I'm
[8:59] talking about that history and we know
[9:01] history repeats itself right we see that
[9:03] the conditions before World War II are
[9:06] the conditions today people are arming
[9:08] up and all these little conflicts going
[9:10] on around the world because the third
[9:12] world is coming we see history repeat
[9:15] and and the and the spiritual history
[9:17] repeats itself self. So if we look at
[9:18] the condition of the Jews, we'll see the
[9:21] condition of believers. Now I just want
[9:23] to say this. Now we're not called we are
[9:26] not ordained to compensate for lack,
[9:29] right? In our spiritual walk. We're
[9:30] called to deal with things, not just
[9:33] compensate because there's this thing in
[9:34] our lives and it just sits there and you
[9:36] know, no, we're called to conquer those
[9:38] things. We're called to deal with those
[9:39] things. We're overcomers today. Okay. So
[9:42] if we look at the, you know, the Jews,
[9:44] well, well, you know, the Leaders church
[9:46] age, it was lukewarm. And and you know,
[9:48] and Jesus said, because you are
[9:49] lukewarm, I'm going to spew you out of
[9:51] my mouth. Now, we've gone through that
[9:53] many uh, you know, before, but we know
[9:55] that that means as brother Ram teaches
[9:56] that that means that they no longer
[9:58] speak for God. So the voice of God is
[10:00] not in the church, right? And the voice
[10:03] of God was not in the scribes or the
[10:06] Pharisees or the Herodians or the Zeots
[10:08] or any of those people. the voice of God
[10:10] wasn't in them because they added
[10:13] tradition. They added additional things
[10:15] to compensate for the lack of God. They
[10:18] had to compensate. They the pillar of
[10:20] fire wasn't there anymore. Right? They
[10:22] had had 400 years of silence between
[10:26] Malachi and John. They had no God wasn't
[10:28] there. Now, that's an astounding thing.
[10:30] You know, you think that's a big
[10:32] statement, but it's true. There's no
[10:33] move of God. There was no spiritual
[10:35] revival. There's a political revival.
[10:37] you know, tried to, you know, they they
[10:39] they they they they had an independent
[10:41] nation for a while and the Romans came
[10:42] in and all these things, but the move of
[10:45] God wasn't there. And you say, "Well,
[10:48] that could never happen to us." You sure
[10:51] in our individual lives now. I want you
[10:53] to think about this deeply. I've been
[10:54] thinking about this all week, putting
[10:56] myself in this bracket because we can
[10:58] form a culture where God is not in it.
[11:01] Those spiritual, though quoting the
[11:02] prophet, quoting the Bible, coming to
[11:04] church, looking like believers, but God
[11:06] is not in it. We can form a culture
[11:08] where God is not there. And we got to be
[11:10] very careful with our because I think
[11:11] about our young people a lot where we we
[11:14] must give them the reality of the Holy
[11:16] Ghost. They must see God live. They must
[11:19] see that this revival. We talk about a
[11:21] bride's revival. It's a revival of the
[11:23] power of God. I mean, it's not just a a
[11:26] a nice doctrine or a new way of
[11:28] thinking. It's far more supreme than
[11:29] that. It's God living in his people like
[11:31] never before. that when you see what God
[11:33] did through the life of brother Bram, he
[11:35] does it through a multi-membered body
[11:37] that there's the reality of God. You
[11:38] know, uh, brother Bram would say that it
[11:40] would come down to a point where there's
[11:42] inspired ministry, but the people are
[11:44] not part of that same inspiration. They
[11:45] just try and grasp what the minister
[11:48] saying. We're not called to live like
[11:49] that. We're called to that. The
[11:50] ministers inspired, the people are
[11:52] inspired, right? It's not just anointed
[11:55] worship on the platform. It's anointed
[11:56] worship through the whole body.
[11:59] Amen. That's what we're what we're
[12:01] called to have. So, so the um spiritual
[12:04] state of Israel when Jesus came the
[12:06] first time is the same state as the
[12:08] world in his second coming. Now, they
[12:10] were in a Ladyosian age as I said that
[12:12] they spoke for themselves. They didn't
[12:13] speak for God anymore. And you know,
[12:15] even even the you know, so I'm just
[12:17] going to lump all the scribes,
[12:18] Pharisees, and Herodians all together in
[12:20] one lump. They had differences between
[12:23] themselves. They emphasized different
[12:24] things, but they were all compensating
[12:27] for God not being there. Okay? And then
[12:29] the sinners and publicans were part of
[12:30] that group, too. They just didn't care.
[12:32] They were just living life, right? So,
[12:33] you can take believers, they can be very
[12:35] strict adherence and do all these
[12:37] things. We'll break that down. Or
[12:39] they're just sinners and publicans. They
[12:41] come to church, they don't care really.
[12:43] Everyone's involved in this. Okay? You
[12:45] know, every every facet of of Jewish
[12:48] religious state isn't among believers.
[12:52] And I'm going to come to true believers,
[12:53] too. Okay? So, this is not all bad,
[12:55] right? But you see, this is so I want to
[12:58] break this all down. As I said that I'm
[13:00] just I just want to trying to stick to
[13:01] my notes here. You see they had they did
[13:03] not have a move of God for 400 years and
[13:06] they were very interested. What they
[13:09] became interested in was maintaining the
[13:11] status quo of their status within
[13:13] Israel. Even they said about Jesus they
[13:15] said if we let him thus alone all men
[13:18] will believe on him and the Romans shall
[13:20] come and take away both our place and
[13:22] our nation. So they said basically if we
[13:24] let this guy who's actually proven to be
[13:26] the Messiah come and take over then our
[13:29] enemy is going to come and destroy us.
[13:30] No, if you let Messiah come and take
[13:32] over your life, your enemy will be
[13:34] defeated. Right? But they are so afraid
[13:36] of all the Romans and you say, "Oh, the
[13:38] devil and the world and all these
[13:39] things. We just got to keep a status quo
[13:41] and we don't want to upset the apple
[13:42] cut." Friends, we want to set fire to
[13:44] the apple cut. We don't just want to we
[13:46] don't just want to upset the apple cut.
[13:48] We want to set fire to it because why?
[13:49] Greater is he that's in you than he
[13:51] that's in the world. Right? But if you
[13:53] want to keep a status quo, I'll say you
[13:54] will stay miserable. You'll stay unhappy
[13:56] in your Christian walk. And all you have
[13:58] is a memory of maybe a years ago of when
[14:01] God once did things. Oh, we're mature
[14:03] now. We've gone through that. Maturity
[14:06] is a greater shout and a greater
[14:08] victory. David danced before the ark. He
[14:10] didn't dance before them that I know of.
[14:12] And he was
[14:13] mature, adopted son of God as the king
[14:16] of Israel, dancing before the Lord.
[14:18] Hallelujah.
[14:19] You know, so we we we can't come see C.
[14:22] See, this is the problem. Religious
[14:25] spirits come in and try and put cement
[14:28] slab on the God's people. We ain't
[14:32] called to live under some slab of an
[14:33] oppression. We're free people today.
[14:36] Amen. But we need to, you know, many
[14:38] people will probably go into it if I if
[14:39] I have time or we'll pick up, you know,
[14:42] another time where many people say of a
[14:45] servant mentality, not a son mentality.
[14:48] We're to go from servants to sons,
[14:50] right? A son and a servant think
[14:52] differently. They act differently. Their
[14:53] attitude is different. We're not called
[14:55] to be servants. Like, sure, we serve one
[14:58] another, but we're not called to be
[14:59] servants. A servant just works for
[15:00] something. Compares with other servants.
[15:03] Fusses, that's trouble because they're
[15:05] looking at, well, I did this. I
[15:06] therefore I'm entitled to that. But a
[15:08] son is like, well, it's all mine. Thank
[15:10] you, Lord. I love you. I'm part of you.
[15:12] A servant's not part of the father. A
[15:15] son is. We'll come to that probably
[15:17] another another time. So you see they
[15:19] had this they had this 400 years God was
[15:21] not
[15:22] there. If I can I'm just trying to can I
[15:25] drive this thing
[15:27] now everything in life like they were
[15:29] compensating because their spiritual
[15:31] life was lacking. So they compensated
[15:34] with other things. So what happens is
[15:36] now brother Brown would speak speak
[15:38] about uh how we live in a three-bedroom
[15:41] house essentially. Sure. Uh some of our
[15:44] houses we may have two living rooms,
[15:45] more than one bedroom, but essentially
[15:47] you live in a three-bedroom house,
[15:48] right? So you live in So he says he says
[15:51] there's the now now God lived in them
[15:53] three rooms. You live in three rooms.
[15:55] You say, "Brother Bram, I've got 10
[15:56] rooms in my house, but you're still only
[15:58] living in three." That's right. It's the
[16:00] kitchen, the dining room. I mean the
[16:02] kitchen, the the living room, and the
[16:04] bedroom. You may have three bedrooms.
[16:06] You may have a subkitchen called the
[16:07] dining room, but there still only three
[16:09] rooms in your house. You're living in a
[16:10] house. a soul, a body, and a spirit.
[16:13] Okay? That's the way God lives in Jesus
[16:15] Christ. Both body, soul, a soul, body,
[16:17] and spirit. Not me that doeth the works
[16:18] of the father that dwelleth in me. So
[16:21] now there's three rooms or three stages
[16:23] of a house. Now, everyone can come into
[16:26] the
[16:26] kitchen and then and then everyone can
[16:29] come to the living room, but it's your
[16:31] private life of your bedroom which
[16:33] really dictates that has the most
[16:35] influence. Your private life has the
[16:37] most influence over the rest of your
[16:39] life. living room, a kitchen. You say
[16:41] that's a very public life. That's your
[16:43] body and your spirit. You could say,
[16:45] right? It's very public. People can see
[16:46] it. But but we actually don't know the
[16:49] real
[16:50] us. We don't. We can come to church. We
[16:53] can put on a, you know, we can dress up,
[16:56] which is fine. We can praise the Lord,
[16:58] which is fine. We can say certain
[17:00] things, have phrasiology of a religion.
[17:03] But what about our soul? What about the
[17:05] real us when we're alone? Are we happy
[17:09] when we're alone? Are we content when
[17:11] we're alone? Are we are are we at peace?
[17:14] Because God lives on the inside of us
[17:15] and he's our all and all and
[17:17] everything's working together for my
[17:19] good. Amen. You know, you know, when
[17:21] we're really alone, are we are we happy
[17:24] or are we discontented? Are we upset?
[17:26] Are there something in our lives that
[17:27] really just just just just just grinds
[17:29] at us? That thing needs to get a get
[17:32] out. That thing needs to be taken care
[17:34] of, right? But you see, people will
[17:38] compensate for those things. Like the
[17:41] Jews, they compensated with the lack of
[17:43] the pillar of fire living in their
[17:46] lives, ruling their ruling their, you
[17:48] know, you know, their their lives. And
[17:50] you'll find individually people who have
[17:52] problems in their private life, the
[17:54] bedroom. It bothers people. In
[17:56] marriages, the biggest problems are
[17:59] bedroom
[18:00] problems. Those things need to be taken
[18:02] care of. You can't compensate for those
[18:04] things. There should be a loving
[18:06] relationship in the bedroom.
[18:09] That's how it should be. We're not
[18:12] Victorians here. There should be love,
[18:15] right? If there's not, it'll cause
[18:18] problems through your whole life. And it
[18:20] comes back to that. You got to be
[18:21] willing to surrender everything and let
[18:24] God have his way, right? So, so it's
[18:27] that it's that soul realm which is the
[18:28] issue because you got to think about it.
[18:31] Is not God more than able to overcome
[18:33] all things?
[18:34] Why do we have to live up with why do we
[18:36] have to live with problems in our
[18:37] spirit? Why do we have to say our
[18:39] complex is greater than our God? Our
[18:41] complexes aren't greater than nothing.
[18:44] So why do we have to live with Now we
[18:46] may get uncomfortable, but hey, we need
[18:48] to get to an uncomfortable places
[18:49] sometimes. I could preach the seven
[18:52] everythings and rainbows and triangles
[18:54] and pyramids and you know and we could
[18:56] all shout, but what about our private
[18:58] life? How does the message come into
[19:00] everyday life? How's it affecting?
[19:02] Because the problem is we've had
[19:03] generation, you know, at least one
[19:05] generation of discontent and unhappy
[19:07] people because the message hasn't come
[19:09] down into everyday life. Hasn't given us
[19:13] victory at home.
[19:16] And that's what we need. Right? That's
[19:19] that's what I need. That's what I'm
[19:21] interested in. And overcoming life is
[19:23] overcoming every day everyday
[19:26] situations. Right? So, you know, God
[19:29] wants our heart. He wants every chamber
[19:31] of it. Amen. He wants every part of our
[19:33] lives that he can live and live his word
[19:36] through every part of our life. There
[19:38] should not be one part of our life that
[19:40] is not according to the word. Amen.
[19:43] Right. So that whether it's our private
[19:46] life, our professional life at job or at
[19:48] school or whatever, every part of our
[19:49] life, brother talks about doors within a
[19:51] door. There's many chambers of the
[19:52] heart, but you got to let God, you got
[19:54] to open and God comes in and rearranges.
[19:58] Amen. Because you know even the Jews
[20:00] they they forgot the very purpose of
[20:02] temple worship. They forgot the very
[20:04] purpose of the Levites and the
[20:05] sacrifices. And God to me sums it up
[20:07] here. And let them make me a sanctuary
[20:09] that I may dwell among them. That's why
[20:12] they had it. That God would dwell among
[20:14] his people. That's all he was interested
[20:16] in. It was more than feast and keeping
[20:18] traditions all these things. See they
[20:20] compensated for the fact God wasn't
[20:22] dwelling among them anymore. Had God
[20:24] changed? No. The people are changed by
[20:27] adding traditions and culture to the
[20:29] word. And then even the message is
[20:31] really to me summed up in Colossians
[20:32] 1:27. To whom God will make known what
[20:35] is the riches of the glory of this
[20:37] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[20:38] Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's
[20:41] the message. That is the message. You
[20:44] say, "Oh, isn't it the seal?" No, it's
[20:45] all that the whole message encapsulated
[20:47] in that one verse. Christ in you, the
[20:50] hope of glory. Amen. That you'd know the
[20:52] riches of that. Amen. You're no longer a
[20:54] servant. You're a son. You're a redeemed
[20:56] child of God, made in his image. Amen.
[20:58] But it's Christ in you. The what? The
[21:00] hope, the expectation of glory. Amen. My
[21:02] soul is heaven bound.
[21:05] Praise the Lord. But you see now people
[21:08] lose sight of that. Why? Because instead
[21:10] of victory, they have to
[21:12] compensate for problems. Amen. Even even
[21:16] brother would say, you know, you because
[21:17] what happened to the Jews? It became a
[21:19] family tradition. Amen. the the the
[21:22] temple worship, even going to synagogue,
[21:24] it be just became a thing they did. It's
[21:27] got to be beyond a thing we just do. No,
[21:29] we no. Why do we come to church? That
[21:31] everyone's pillar of fire, liquor fire
[21:33] will come together. God will come down
[21:35] into his word. God will meet every need.
[21:37] Amen. God will speak the hearts. God
[21:39] will break complexes. God will set the
[21:41] captive free. Amen. God will refill us
[21:43] with the Holy Ghost. God will answer
[21:45] prayer. Amen. God will give us a
[21:47] stability. God will mature us. That's
[21:49] why we come to church, isn't it? Amen.
[21:50] that we would worship God in spirit and
[21:52] in truth. I mean, that's why the message
[21:54] came our way to restore a true spiritual
[21:57] relationship between God and man. And if
[22:00] it does anything short of that in your
[22:01] life, there's something wrong. Because
[22:04] that's why it came. That's why Jesus
[22:05] died. That a true spiritual relationship
[22:07] that you would know him. Amen. Not just
[22:10] know about him, know him. Amen. Say, "Do
[22:12] you know the Lord Jesus?" Oh yes.
[22:15] Oh yes, I do. He found me. Amen. He
[22:20] talks to me every day. I talk to He
[22:22] guides me. He comforts me. He shows me
[22:24] his word. Amen. It's not something I'm
[22:26] trying to work out. But he reveals
[22:27] himself.
[22:29] Amen. That was the whole purpose. That's
[22:30] the purpose of the message. Hallelujah.
[22:34] We cannot diminish at anything less than
[22:36] that. Amen. That man and God is
[22:39] reconciled.
[22:41] Hallelujah. Amen. But you see, it became
[22:43] a family
[22:45] tradition among the Jewish people. that
[22:47] even brother Bam says about the
[22:48] Pentecostal movement, it's become a
[22:51] family tradition. I say if we're not
[22:53] careful, this message will become a
[22:54] family tradition. It's not called to be
[22:56] a family tradition. Amen. No, but every
[22:59] generation must have its own revival.
[23:01] Amen. But you see, they they begin to
[23:04] compensate for a lack of God. And what
[23:06] happens is churches, they compensate,
[23:08] amen, for the pillar fire not moving
[23:10] among them anymore by programs, by by
[23:13] systematic theology and different things
[23:15] to get people trapped into a cell group
[23:17] or a life group or a youth group,
[23:19] whatever it more, and keep them in a
[23:21] system or or they or they put in
[23:24] entertainment and smoke screens and
[23:25] lights and all these things and
[23:27] fantastics and all these things to keep
[23:29] people gripped in. It becomes a
[23:31] tradition. Why? because they're
[23:33] compensating because the pillar of fire
[23:34] is not there. Amen. They have a very
[23:36] ritualistic form of worship. Like I, you
[23:39] know, I've said when I was in Chile with
[23:40] my brother-in-law Pedro and I was there
[23:42] with the Pentecostal churches, good
[23:44] people, sincere people, loving people,
[23:47] they look like believers, act like
[23:48] believers, but yet because they have not
[23:50] moved with the pillar of fire, there's
[23:52] something missing in the church. You
[23:54] feel it. It's like you're restricted.
[23:56] You're in a box. But when you go among
[23:57] the believers there, it's just liberty
[23:59] like you're at home here. Why? Because
[24:01] God is present. I wish you could
[24:02] experience it to know what I'm talking
[24:04] about. And maybe we'll all go to Chile,
[24:06] a Jimmy, we'll go on a field trip. Amen.
[24:09] But you see, but but you know there's
[24:10] Why? But they have to compensate by a
[24:13] systematic way of
[24:15] worship. We ain't called to be
[24:17] systematic here. Even church order,
[24:19] there's a purpose of it. What's the
[24:21] purpose? That God would come down and
[24:23] meet us. Amen. You got to see what is
[24:25] the thrust of having church the way the
[24:27] prophet set it up. That God would come
[24:28] down and meet us.
[24:30] That's the you if you're just looking at
[24:32] all the details, you're missing the
[24:33] picture. The picture is that God would
[24:35] come down and meet us. Why do we come
[24:38] half an hour earlier? Because so we get
[24:40] into a spiritual state that we're ready.
[24:45] Amen. You know, sure, you may not be
[24:47] able to make it. We'll drive to but you
[24:49] drive to church at least. Say, "Lord,
[24:50] I'm preparing. Lord, prepare my heart.
[24:53] Get me ready, Lord, for my visitation.
[24:55] I'm excited, Lord. I'm coming to your
[24:56] presence."
[24:58] Amen.
[25:00] But you see they they
[25:02] would they would do things to
[25:05] compensate. Now let's go through a few.
[25:07] Amen. Now here's one. When thou prayest,
[25:12] thou shalt not be like the hypocrites
[25:14] are for they love to st pray standing in
[25:16] the synagogues in the corners of the
[25:17] streets that they may be seen of men.
[25:19] Verily I say unto you that they have
[25:21] their reward. So here is someone trying
[25:24] to differentiate himself from the rest
[25:26] of the believers, trying to look better
[25:29] than everyone else. A public display.
[25:32] Look how more holier I am because of
[25:34] what I'm doing. You know, and and you
[25:37] see there, but he's compensating for
[25:39] something. God is not
[25:42] living. You say, well, of course that,
[25:44] you know, that's obvious here. Look,
[25:45] he's a Jew and God's moved on and you
[25:47] know, he's physically binding the word
[25:49] on his forehead and all, you know, his
[25:51] hands and all these things. And sincere,
[25:53] yes. Dedicated, yes. But he's
[25:57] compensating for a lack of victory.
[25:59] That's what the Jews did. They're
[26:00] compensating for a lack of victory. And
[26:02] we'll come to that soon. But you see
[26:04] what was he trying to do? He's seeking
[26:06] to look better than the rest of the
[26:07] believers. And you bring that into, you
[26:10] know, into into our modern day. Some
[26:13] parents put such pressure on their
[26:14] children to look good because they don't
[26:17] want to look bad themselves. Don't
[26:19] embarrass me today. Children, you're
[26:21] embarrassed. Many times we embarrass our
[26:23] kids.
[26:25] Prideful, arrogant attitudes is an
[26:27] embarrassment. You know, but you see,
[26:29] yeah, but people parents put such
[26:32] pressure on the outward appearance. You
[26:35] better shape up children because we're
[26:37] believers and this is what we should do.
[26:39] But it's out of a not wanting to look
[26:41] bad, wanting to look spiritual. What
[26:43] about the heart of your children? What
[26:45] about the heart of your spouse? Are you
[26:47] actually ministering to their heart
[26:49] where they feel safe, secure, loved,
[26:51] where they actually want what you have?
[26:53] Or do they see just a sergeant major, a
[26:56] drill
[26:57] sergeant? I don't want to be
[27:00] that. Oh, but you know, we're believers.
[27:02] We got we got a loan to I mean a line to
[27:06] you know, we got to match up to the
[27:08] word. Let God do it. Let God matches to
[27:11] the word. If it's just an outward
[27:13] conformity and there's nothing on the
[27:15] inside, why do you think many people
[27:18] leave? Because what's put in front of
[27:20] them cannot satisfy.
[27:23] Amen. See, it doesn't to to just look
[27:26] like a believer doesn't satisfy a
[27:29] hunger. But when you meet him,
[27:32] it's all done. You're satisfied. You're
[27:35] so happy. You have peace. You got joy.
[27:38] Amen. You have what God said you would
[27:40] receive. Amen. Sure there's a you know
[27:43] you know sure there's modesty and
[27:44] there's things to you know line up to.
[27:47] I'm not against those things. That's why
[27:48] I say I don't want to be misunderstood.
[27:51] But if you're but if you're just judging
[27:53] things by how the outward it's actually
[27:55] pride just manifesting. What about the
[27:57] heart of the individual? Do you care
[27:59] enough or do you just care about what
[28:01] you look like in the front side of other
[28:02] people? Or do you really
[28:04] care about your family? That's right.
[28:08] Amen. You know, we can have an attitude.
[28:11] I'm glad my family's not like that
[28:12] family. You're being like that guy.
[28:16] Oh, I'm glad my children aren't like or
[28:17] those people that the reason they're
[28:19] this is because of this. You're being
[28:20] like this guy. You're exalting yourself
[28:22] above the other believers. We should
[28:25] never be like
[28:27] that. Many people, you know, they put a
[28:30] pressure on their family because they
[28:31] want to prove a point to someone else.
[28:33] They're not worshiping God anymore.
[28:35] They're worshiping that person. They're
[28:37] trying to live up to that person's
[28:39] expectation. I'll show
[28:41] them. No, no, no. Lord, come and live.
[28:44] Come and have your way live, Lord
[28:47] Jesus.
[28:50] Amen. And then another thing people
[28:53] people will bury themselves in is
[28:56] scholarship. I'm not against studying
[28:58] the message. I'm not against studying
[29:01] the Bible. I'm not against listening.
[29:03] So, I need to put that qualifier in
[29:04] because some people take that and say,
[29:06] "Well, he says no, he doesn't believe in
[29:07] that." I do. But people bury themselves
[29:10] in looking for specialty doctrines and
[29:12] understandings to try and make
[29:14] themselves better than the rest. And
[29:16] what is it? They compensating for a lack
[29:19] of
[29:20] victory. This is what the Jews did. They
[29:23] scholarship in the Torah was seen as
[29:24] essential for understanding and adhering
[29:26] to Jewish law and tradition. What about
[29:29] the Lord writing his laws in their
[29:30] hearts? What about God shaping them and
[29:33] molding them to match his word? No, they
[29:36] intellectually they say if my mind knows
[29:38] enough of the word then therefore I will
[29:41] overcome. But it could never it was
[29:43] compensating for the fact they're
[29:44] lacking in their
[29:46] hearts. Education especially in the
[29:48] Torah was highly regarded and practiced
[29:51] through repetition and
[29:53] memorization. Oh my, he knows Genesis to
[29:55] Malachi forward and back. Man, he's
[29:58] deep. He must really know what he's
[30:00] talking about. No victory. Where was the
[30:03] God of Moses in his life? You know, many
[30:06] people, they'll come and talk to you
[30:08] about things and they'll say, "Well,
[30:09] how's it working out for you?" That's
[30:10] what I feel like saying, you know,
[30:12] "How's it working out for you? Where's
[30:14] your victory? Where's your testimony?"
[30:16] I've said to people who have left,
[30:17] people who still watch these things, I
[30:19] don't know why they do, looking for
[30:20] things to criticize. I say, "What's it
[30:22] doing in your life what you've got now?"
[30:24] Give me a testimony, please. If you got
[30:26] more of God, I want it. nothing. I feel
[30:30] sorry for them. I really do. But you
[30:33] see, we don't want to bury ourselves
[30:35] and, you know, people, you know, look
[30:37] into things like, "Did Adam have a belly
[30:39] button?" I'm just saying a ridiculous
[30:41] thing. And if you don't see that,
[30:42] brother, you're not deep enough. It's a
[30:45] who cares doctrine. Does it pertain to
[30:47] salvation? Does it give you any victory?
[30:52] Oh, but the original Hebrew blah blah
[30:54] blah blah blah blah blah. Look into
[30:55] those things. It's fine. But does it
[30:57] really help you? It's compensating
[31:00] because of a lack of the pillar of fire.
[31:03] I'll put it I'll just say it just that.
[31:04] But a lack of victory. Compensating
[31:07] because there's an enemy in their life
[31:08] that needs to be eradicated. But instead
[31:10] of dealing with it, they what do they
[31:13] do?
[31:14] If you don't see it that way, brother, I
[31:17] don't care if he had two belly buttons
[31:19] or none. It means nothing to me. You
[31:22] say, you don't just don't care about
[31:23] details. No, I care about things that
[31:25] matter. Amen. I care about things that
[31:27] will help me as a person, as a parent,
[31:29] as a brother, as a pastor. I'm
[31:31] interested in those things. Amen. Praise
[31:34] the Lord. Praise the Lord. You see, it's
[31:36] like, you know, and and what does this
[31:39] produce? Because it actually cuts both
[31:41] ways about being buried in scholarship.
[31:42] He says, now he has cried out to this
[31:44] last age, you have the word, you have
[31:46] more Bibles than ever, but you're not
[31:48] doing anything about the word except
[31:49] dividing and hacking into pieces, taking
[31:52] what you want and leaving out what you
[31:54] don't want. You're not interested in
[31:55] living it but debating
[31:57] it. You see, we got to realize that as
[32:00] Jesus would say, for out of the
[32:02] abundance of the heart, the mouth
[32:03] speaketh. So people who are interested
[32:06] in debating, what do they do? They just
[32:08] their main focus is they just want to
[32:10] criticize other people, criticize what
[32:12] they teach, criticize what they do. They
[32:15] just have a debating spirit. They're not
[32:17] actually interested in living what, but
[32:19] they're compensating for a lack of
[32:21] victory. I trust we're all together
[32:23] here. You may think you're way out of
[32:24] left field. No, I feel this is true.
[32:27] People like everyone who points fingers
[32:29] like this. What about here? Cuz if
[32:32] there's victory in here, it'll flow out.
[32:36] Amen. There'll be a joy to be around
[32:37] that person. You'll feel refreshed being
[32:39] in their presence. You won't feel torn
[32:41] down and million questions in your mind
[32:43] and you know shaking sands and looking
[32:45] at people the wrong way. No, you will
[32:47] feel the the love of the Lord. You'll
[32:49] feel closer if there's victory in here
[32:52] in a person. If there's criticism and
[32:54] debate and all these things, then then
[32:55] it makes you look at people all the
[32:57] wrong way.
[33:00] So, they're interested in debating it
[33:02] instead of letting. But I'm interested
[33:04] in letting the word live. That's all I
[33:07] care about. Does it live? He said it
[33:09] would live. Does it live? Yes. Praise
[33:12] God. Let's keep pushing on. No. Well,
[33:14] let's deal with that thing because he
[33:16] wants to live.
[33:18] Amen. You say, "Well, I haven't cut the
[33:21] word to pieces. I haven't, you know,
[33:23] dissected and hacked it and taken bits I
[33:25] want and things I don't want. I'll tell
[33:26] you what, if you've got an unforgiving
[33:28] spirit, you've hacked the word to
[33:29] pieces. You've neglected the word that
[33:32] says you've got to forgive.
[33:35] Amen. If you're jealous, you have taken
[33:38] the word where it says do not be jealous
[33:41] and you've actually hacked that off and
[33:42] say, "I don't want that anymore." You
[33:44] have neglected that. He says, "But if
[33:46] you have a bitter envy and strife in
[33:48] your hearts, glory not and lie not
[33:50] against the truth. This wisdom ascendeth
[33:52] not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
[33:54] and devilish. For envying and strife is
[33:56] there's confusion and every works. And
[33:59] envying, or envy is jealousy, right? A
[34:02] sound heart is life of the flesh. But
[34:04] envy, the rottness of the bones. So
[34:07] there's jealousy in there. What was
[34:09] wrong with the scribes and Pharisees?
[34:11] They were jealous of
[34:13] Jesus. They were jealous of him because
[34:16] he could produce what he believed.
[34:18] People were jealous of brother Brandon
[34:19] because he produced what he believed.
[34:21] But it wasn't him producing it. It was
[34:23] the angel of the Lord through a divine
[34:25] commission that produced in him the word
[34:28] of God. But people were jealous. It
[34:30] didn't come through their group or their
[34:32] thought or their way. And they became
[34:33] they were jealous. And what did it do?
[34:35] It was rottness in their bones. So don't
[34:38] be jealous. You got to realize no that
[34:40] has no part in me. But I tell you, if
[34:42] you hold on to unforgiveness,
[34:44] resentment, jealousy, you have divided
[34:47] part of the word out. You say, "I don't
[34:49] want that." Cuz Jesus said, "When you
[34:50] pray, forgive." He says, "If you don't
[34:53] forgive, I won't forgive you. I want to
[34:55] be forgiven."
[34:57] Amen. I want total forgiveness. I don't
[34:59] want to be, you know, I don't want
[35:00] anything against me. I want nothing
[35:02] between my soul and my savior. So, I'm
[35:04] going to forgive. I'm going to take that
[35:05] part of the word.
[35:08] Amen.
[35:12] Amen. You know, but you see they were
[35:14] compensating because they all they knew
[35:16] was scholarship and tradition as opposed
[35:19] to
[35:20] him. Says in the mighty conqueror the
[35:23] Bible said they they were ignorant and
[35:25] unlearned men. His apostles was they
[35:27] might not have known much about botany.
[35:30] They might not have knowed much about
[35:31] mathematics or algebra or anything of
[35:33] that sort of our modern education. They
[35:36] might not have known much about that.
[35:38] But they know him and that's the main
[35:40] thing to know him as life. Remember uh
[35:43] that Christian friend and sinner friend
[35:45] to know Christ as life. Many people go
[35:47] and they learn a catechism they think
[35:49] it's life. Many people go and learn the
[35:51] Bible they think that's life. And many
[35:53] people know the doctrine of their church
[35:55] they think that's life. All those things
[35:56] are good. But to know him personally as
[35:59] you personal as your personal individual
[36:01] savior that is life. And that alone to
[36:04] know him it's good to know your
[36:05] catechism good to know your books. It's
[36:07] good to know your doctrine of your
[36:09] church, but all of that is the sideline.
[36:12] But to know him is to know life, and to
[36:15] have life is to know him.
[36:18] Amen. So, it's all good to know all, you
[36:20] know, quote everything from 47 to 65 in
[36:22] Genesis to Revelation, but you got to
[36:24] know him. That's why I say I don't throw
[36:27] away studying the message, studying the
[36:29] word. Do all it to your heart's content,
[36:31] but don't do it to compensate because of
[36:33] a lack of victory. Amen. do it with
[36:36] victory to be a far different study. You
[36:38] have a glorious jubilee time.
[36:42] Hallelujah. Amen. So, we need to know
[36:45] the doctrine. We need to know the word
[36:47] to study it. But that is just the
[36:49] sideline. You've got to know him. That's
[36:51] why I ask the question when you're by
[36:53] yourself in your heart of hearts. Are
[36:55] you happy? Are you content that you know
[36:58] him or do you just know about him?
[37:02] Right? We're not here to conform to a
[37:05] culture. The Jews had a culture of no
[37:08] victory, but they were the Jewish
[37:10] people, sons and daughters of Abraham.
[37:12] They could point back to their, you
[37:14] know, Moses, we had Moses disciples,
[37:16] and, you know, they could point to a a a
[37:19] correct foundation, but they had moved
[37:22] off it. We can do the same
[37:25] thing. You see, because any doctrine
[37:29] that is that is true has power with it.
[37:32] As Jesus would come down to Capernium, a
[37:34] city of Galilee, they and taught them on
[37:36] the Sabbath days. They were astonished
[37:38] at his doctrine for his word was with
[37:40] power. It wasn't just word only, but it
[37:43] was a demonstration of the Holy Ghost.
[37:45] It was God proving. And then what
[37:46] happened when you know brother, you
[37:48] know, when brother Ram was preaching
[37:49] what God came in with power to prove
[37:52] this is not his word. It is the Bible
[37:55] being taught correctly.
[37:57] Amen. And it should be the same thing
[37:59] with us. Any doctrine that comes out,
[38:01] it's got to have power associated with
[38:03] it. It can't just be an empty argument.
[38:06] Though it may be true, right? But it's
[38:08] got to have power. It's got to be an
[38:09] anointing that comes in and vindicates
[38:12] that to be the truth. Amen. Amen. That's
[38:14] why I'm very very interested
[38:17] uh in the dynamics of this revival and
[38:20] God pouring out his spirit more and
[38:22] more. Amen. God proving his word to be
[38:24] the truth. Amen. For him to be our
[38:26] satisfying portion.
[38:29] Amen. Now, another thing the Pharisees
[38:33] compensated with compensated with uh um
[38:36] for inner problems by adhering by
[38:39] because I'll just read this. The
[38:42] Pharisees expanded the law of Moses 613
[38:45] commandments with numerous additional
[38:46] rules and regulations often described as
[38:49] a fence around the law. This oral
[38:51] tradition known as the oral Torah or
[38:54] Mishna aimed to clarify and safeguard
[38:57] the written law but resulted in a
[38:59] complex legalistic system. They were
[39:02] compensating. So some buried themselves
[39:04] in scholarship. Some buried themselves
[39:06] in in in in a strict adherence to the
[39:09] law. Well, they thought it was the law
[39:11] to try and compensate the fact God
[39:13] wasn't there. Same thing we find among
[39:16] believers that that you know they get to
[39:18] a strict adherence of the word but
[39:20] especially and they nitpick on things
[39:22] that don't really matter. Like some will
[39:25] criticize because sister's skirts aren't
[39:27] to the floor and their and their sleeves
[39:29] aren't to their wrists. What's that got
[39:32] to do with it? If your skirt is below
[39:34] your knee, your thighs not shown, then
[39:36] you're not naked. You're being modest,
[39:38] right? You got a sleeve, you got to
[39:40] sleeve. Brother Amos has even asked the
[39:41] question of length of sleeve. He's like,
[39:43] "What are you even
[39:44] asking?" But people will make that thing
[39:46] the main thing. Like the Pharisees
[39:49] criticizing the disciples. They don't
[39:50] wash hands and all these things. Does it
[39:53] really
[39:54] matter? Yeah. What is holiness? Is it
[39:56] more holy to have a skirt that drags the
[39:59] floor or a skirt that's below the knee?
[40:00] What's more
[40:02] holy? They're the same. You're not
[40:05] You're not holier because you got more
[40:06] clothing on that you don't need. Is this
[40:09] okay? You got to think about this. You
[40:11] know many people, oh that person's not
[40:12] deep in the m look how they dress. Are
[40:14] they
[40:15] modest? Then what's the problem? But you
[40:18] see people think if they're strictly
[40:20] adhere to beyond what the prophet what
[40:22] the word teaches they think, oh now I'm
[40:25] now I'm really it. It doesn't solve the
[40:27] problem
[40:30] inside. We don't want to be see we don't
[40:34] want to be caught up in things you know
[40:36] eagle belt buckles. You got to have the
[40:38] right kind of hat. You must hunt and
[40:41] fish. Well, I'm out.
[40:44] Sorry. It's been nice knowing you. I
[40:47] don't have the eagle bell buckle either.
[40:48] Hey, man. Pray for me. No. But you But
[40:51] some people hold those things so
[40:53] important. Oh, have you been to the
[40:54] tabernacle? No. Have you been to Sunset
[40:57] Mountain? No. Have you done this and
[40:58] that? No, I haven't done any of those
[40:59] things. Does it matter? To know him is
[41:02] life. To know the Lord is life. Not to
[41:05] be caught up in the messenger's
[41:06] personality and all these things. people
[41:09] are looking trying to compensate for the
[41:10] lack of victory. It's to me that's all
[41:12] it boils down
[41:14] to. You know, there's not it I find it
[41:17] so amazing when you know our Lord Jesus
[41:20] when he was here, he conquered
[41:22] everything that can be conquered. The
[41:24] things that would sit in their churches
[41:26] for years. There's a woman that was
[41:27] bound up by an infirmity. Couldn't stand
[41:29] up straight for um I think it was 15 odd
[41:31] years or something. I I can't remember
[41:33] it exactly right now, but she was bound
[41:35] up. came to church ye um Sabbath after
[41:38] Sabbath couldn't stand up straight just
[41:40] got worse and worse and worse and then
[41:42] when Jesus came to church touch her say
[41:45] daughter stand up and behold she stood
[41:47] up straight glorifying God were they
[41:50] happy about it they were upset oh he's
[41:52] breaking our church order this is wrong
[41:54] he shouldn't be doing these things and
[41:56] the very God of glory was standing in
[41:59] their midst and set someone free who had
[42:01] been that way for years and they weren't
[42:03] even happy about it and and I find it
[42:06] astounding even I just think they were
[42:08] insane that they did not say to him how
[42:11] do we get victory again we read about
[42:13] Moses we read about David we read about
[42:16] Gideon we read about you know Joshua and
[42:19] Isaiah and Hezekiah and all how God
[42:22] moved years ago in our forefathers how
[42:25] do we get back to that rabbi they never
[42:28] asked the
[42:29] question you know even why because their
[42:32] culture had had degraded to such a point
[42:35] where a move of the supernatural was
[42:37] completely out of the question. Oh,
[42:39] we're in the third pull now. We don't
[42:41] need miracles. That's the second pull.
[42:42] Everything the first and second come
[42:44] into the third in a greater measure.
[42:46] Amen. When brother Ram had the dream or
[42:48] the vision of the three, you know, you
[42:49] know, there's the small birds that came
[42:51] and then the bigger birds that came,
[42:52] then the third was angels to him, right?
[42:55] And so this is the time of the end of
[42:56] you know what is it? So it's three, it's
[42:59] it's it's three sets of creatures that
[43:01] all can fly, but they get more powerful.
[43:03] Amen. So what is it? When the word comes
[43:05] open, there's far more power released of
[43:07] the Holy Ghost into our lives than ever
[43:10] before. I believe that. Amen. I believe
[43:13] that that God wants to restore us back
[43:15] to the book of Acts where he lives in
[43:17] power, gives us an overcoming life.
[43:19] Amen. In every facet of our lives, we
[43:21] are overcoming. Amen. Where we identify
[43:24] our enemy and then that enemy
[43:26] automatically gets an expiry date on him
[43:28] because God is going to bring him down.
[43:31] I believe that. Amen. But you see their
[43:34] culture had degraded to such a point
[43:35] that any supernatural move was out of
[43:37] the question. Amen. Even Gideon, you
[43:39] know, Gideon was a scriptural man as as
[43:41] brother would say. And you know, Gideon
[43:43] asked the question, "If the Lord be with
[43:45] us, why has all this befallen us? And
[43:48] where be all his miracles which our
[43:50] fathers told us of? Where is this God
[43:53] that once lived?" They never asked Jesus
[43:55] that question. He was standing right in
[43:57] front of them. I don't want to make you
[43:59] uncomfortable by these things, you know,
[44:01] but you know, we need to think about
[44:02] these things
[44:04] deeply. Are we overcoming or is there
[44:08] something in our lives that we actually
[44:09] choose to let sit
[44:12] there? There's actually only one person
[44:14] who came to Jesus and he came by
[44:18] night because he wanted to
[44:21] know. Brother said, "Bro, at least he
[44:24] came. He wanted to know. Here's a ruler.
[44:29] Here's the up-ups. He sees behind closed
[44:31] doors with the other the high priest and
[44:33] all these ones and he sees there's
[44:35] something lacking. There's nothing wrong
[44:37] with the word. There's nothing wrong
[44:39] with the Lord, but there's something
[44:41] lacking in them. So, he comes to the
[44:42] very one who gave the word. And then
[44:45] Jesus says very simply, unless a man is
[44:48] born again, unless their heart is
[44:50] converted, unless they've been changed
[44:52] on the inside of the inside, that's the
[44:55] answer to every problem.
[44:58] Amen. It really is that simple. See,
[45:00] we're not called to live with problems.
[45:03] You say, "Well, the Lord's changed my
[45:05] life." Good, but now there should be
[45:06] victory coming out of that. Yeah, I had
[45:09] a real experience. That was God. But
[45:11] grow in that experience. Feed that
[45:13] experience. Don't just say it's a one
[45:15] time. See, when God does something, it's
[45:17] not an isolated thing. That's like this
[45:20] happened and now you No, he walks with
[45:22] you from that into your whole life.
[45:25] Amen. But there's parts of ourselves as
[45:27] we walk with God that we need a renewal.
[45:29] We need a another surrender. We need
[45:32] another repentance. We need another, you
[45:35] know, giving. Like the Lord Jesus, he
[45:36] came to Jordan to be baptized.
[45:39] Represents death to self. But what did
[45:41] he do before he went to Calvary? went to
[45:43] Gethsemane.
[45:45] Amen. Gave himself, died again, you
[45:49] could say. Gave his life, surrendered
[45:51] more cuz there was more for him to
[45:53] accomplish. Amen. Than than than the
[45:55] previous years of his life. I say,
[45:57] friends, there's more for us to
[45:59] accomplish. There's more that God wants
[46:01] to do in these last few, however long
[46:03] we're here until he takes us home.
[46:05] There's more to do. There's more of God
[46:07] to be manifested. There's more of his
[46:08] word to put on flesh. That's more than
[46:11] just talking about it. But it lives.
[46:14] I'm not saying you don't have an
[46:16] experience, but God wants to take us
[46:17] further. I mean, he doesn't want us to
[46:19] live in a stalemate where we're just
[46:21] constantly waring with ourselves or
[46:23] waring with a problem and it's just a
[46:24] back and forth and subduing something.
[46:27] We're not called to just subdue the
[46:28] enemy. We're called to annihilate him.
[46:30] Amen. Where it's not even a thought in
[46:32] our mind. It's not even a thing that
[46:34] enters and bothers us no more. But it's
[46:36] under our feet and it stays there.
[46:39] Amen. That's the That's the power of our
[46:41] God. Now, I'll say this before we go
[46:43] into this next part. There were some
[46:45] people who were looking for him that
[46:46] weren't bound down by
[46:48] tradition. I believe I'm looking at them
[46:51] here. Amen. But there was Simon and
[46:55] Anna in the
[46:57] temple. They weren't tradition didn't
[47:00] blind them. She was a blind prophetist,
[47:03] but she could see far more than those
[47:04] priests. Amen. when Mary and Joseph
[47:07] brought Jesus to the temple wrapped up
[47:09] in swaddling cloth, you know, he he had
[47:11] already been, you know, already had that
[47:13] name of an illegitimate child and they
[47:15] didn't want to stand by the
[47:17] Messiah. They were proud to be
[47:22] identified. They weren't ashamed to
[47:25] embrace him. Amen. Cuz the Holy Ghost
[47:28] told told Simon, "You will not see death
[47:31] until you see the Lord's Christ." God
[47:33] said, "You're going to see the word
[47:35] fulfilled in your day." Hallelujah. So,
[47:37] he was waiting for that consolation.
[47:39] Then finally, when he lifted up the
[47:42] Hallelujah,
[47:43] he says, "I can depart in peace now. The
[47:46] rest of my life, I'm living in peace.
[47:48] I'm not troubled no more cuz God has
[47:51] vindicated his word. The thing that I
[47:53] need, he's given me." Amen.
[47:56] Has he given you that? Has he given you
[47:58] the Holy Ghost? It's a gift. You don't
[48:00] have to earn it. You just got to accept
[48:02] it. You don't have to earn it and work
[48:04] it out. He's here to be received.
[48:07] Amen. So he said, "Lord, let thy servant
[48:09] depart in peace for mine eyes have seen
[48:11] thy salvation." And when the word
[48:13] becomes alive to you, when he changes
[48:15] your nature, he changes your life, you
[48:17] can say, "Lord, I can depart in peace
[48:18] now cuz it is well with my soul."
[48:23] Hallelujah. Amen. It was according it
[48:26] was the uh it was the inspiration of the
[48:28] Holy Ghost struck him and God fulfilled
[48:30] it. It was according to his
[48:34] word. I'm just going to I'm not going to
[48:36] be well I'll pick this up another time.
[48:39] But you know you say well I believe the
[48:41] word. I believe the whole word of God.
[48:44] Brother Ram says it's like that's good
[48:47] but you need a lighting of the
[48:49] candle. We must have victory. You say,
[48:51] "Well, I have the Holy Ghost." Through
[48:54] the book of Acts, the candle was
[48:56] reit. God poured out his spirit again.
[49:00] He didn't. So, sure, he sealed them into
[49:02] the kingdom on the day of Pentecost. But
[49:04] he refilled them. Trouble came in. What
[49:08] combed the trouble? God pouring his
[49:10] spirit out into the church again. Took
[49:12] that thing away. That that is the answer
[49:15] to every problem. Like brother Isaac was
[49:17] saying, we've come to the solution. He
[49:20] is the solution of every problem. They
[49:22] didn't have to have a meeting and you
[49:23] know because what they were threatened
[49:25] do not preach in his name anymore. This
[49:27] pressure came upon them you know the
[49:29] whole pressure of the Sanhedrin came
[49:31] upon them. The same ones that sentenced
[49:33] Jesus to die with the same ones saying
[49:35] you better stop preaching in his name.
[49:36] What did they do? Did they did they come
[49:39] and have a meeting and say now seven
[49:40] steps to overcoming pressure? How to be
[49:44] a Christian in you know in liberty again
[49:47] and just have a have a conference and
[49:48] talk about humanistically how they can
[49:51] overcome. No, they didn't
[49:53] compensate. They went to their source.
[49:55] They went to the answer and the answer
[49:57] refilled them with himself and they went
[50:00] out with boldness. I mean you got to
[50:02] realize problems in your life, problems
[50:03] from your past, God wants to deal with
[50:05] it. Amen. and he wants to refill you. He
[50:08] wants to drive that thing out that it's
[50:10] no longer a problem.
[50:12] See, God saves our souls, but it's our
[50:14] spirit realm that needs to be dealt
[50:16] with. There's strongholds and problems
[50:18] and things that God has put his finger
[50:20] on, but are we willing? Do we just
[50:22] compensate for them or do we let him
[50:25] level that place and build his kingdom
[50:28] there? And you say, "Well, I believe
[50:30] every speck of it." When the word is,
[50:32] you know, then the word is laying there,
[50:34] but it's just like waiting for the Holy
[50:36] Spirit to put it to work. It just takes
[50:38] a lighting of the candle. There's the
[50:40] candle with the wick in it with all the
[50:41] tallow and everything. It has to be that
[50:43] candle. But until the fire comes on it,
[50:46] it will not shine any light. No matter
[50:48] how perfect the candle is, how perfect
[50:50] it'll burn and everything, it's got to
[50:51] be liten. And when it burns and when you
[50:54] believe and is made up of the
[50:55] instructions of what the Holy Ghost is
[50:56] of love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[50:58] goodness, the fruits that it bears out
[51:00] until the Holy Spirit with a fire
[51:02] experience comes down and lights that
[51:03] candle, then you haven't received the
[51:05] Holy Ghost. There's got to be an
[51:07] experience where God changes you. It's
[51:10] got to be a lighting of the candle. But
[51:12] do we compensate for a candle not lit?
[51:15] You know yourself. I'm not trying to put
[51:18] something on you like this. It's got to
[51:19] be this way. But you know where you are
[51:20] with the Lord.
[51:22] Right? So let's not let's not just sit
[51:24] back and compensate for something. No,
[51:26] we should have victory. We should have a
[51:28] and what I mean by victory is there
[51:30] should be such a peace in our souls that
[51:32] it is well. Amen.
[51:37] He says this here. Now I'm just going to
[51:39] close with these couple of thoughts here
[51:41] because our enemy that's in us will
[51:43] either he says this in once more. He
[51:45] says let me tell you something. You'd
[51:46] better destroy your enemy before your
[51:48] enemy destroys you. What was the Jews
[51:51] enemy was actually their own culture
[51:52] they formed burying themselves in the
[51:55] wrong things scholarship strict
[51:57] adherence to the law or they just
[51:58] publicans and sinners they just didn't
[52:00] care they lived any kind of life they
[52:01] wanted to they were compensating for a
[52:03] lack of the pillar of fire living in
[52:04] them in their midst right so you got to
[52:07] realize that your that there's things in
[52:09] our lives if we let it it will destroy
[52:12] us it will destroy our homes destroy our
[52:14] lives destroy marriages it will wreck
[52:17] everything so you've got to destroy that
[52:19] thing before it destroys you. You say,
[52:22] "I'm just doing just fine. I'm okay."
[52:25] That thing, do not live with it anymore.
[52:28] You are not called to live with
[52:29] problems, pain, hurt. There's nothing
[52:32] God can't fix.
[52:34] Amen. There's nothing God can't fix. I
[52:36] don't care how deep the wound is. You
[52:37] may be one big wound. God can fix you.
[52:39] Amen. God never gets to a point like
[52:41] people in the ICU or with the doctors
[52:43] where the doctors say, "Sorry, I can't
[52:45] help you anymore." God ain't that kind
[52:47] of physician. God is the great
[52:49] physician. He can fix anything. It
[52:51] doesn't matter how bad it may be, how
[52:53] impossible you may think it is. God is
[52:55] more than able to fix it. You say,
[52:57] "Well, this is just how I am." The
[52:59] Apostle Paul thought he was a certain
[53:01] way, but then God fixed him on the road
[53:03] to Damascus. He began to feed that
[53:05] experience in the word and realize who
[53:06] he was in God. The woman at the well
[53:08] would have thought, "Well, I've just got
[53:09] this man problem. I just can't. There's
[53:11] nothing that satisfies me. I'll find it
[53:14] one day." And probably someone else. She
[53:16] was looking for love in the wrong places
[53:18] but the but the solution came her way at
[53:20] the well and fixed
[53:22] her legion many others ourselves as well
[53:27] there was nothing that satis I'm sure we
[53:29] could all agree with that song there's
[53:31] nothing in this world that can satisfy
[53:32] or could satisfy but when I met him the
[53:35] great riches of treasure Jesus Christ my
[53:37] lord
[53:39] you say well how can I overcome see this
[53:42] is where you actually are involved if I
[53:45] can
[53:45] find this here because David David would
[53:49] say in the Psalms, he says, "Blessed be
[53:52] the Lord, my strength, which teacheth my
[53:54] hands to war and my fingers to fight. My
[53:59] goodness and my fortress, my high tower,
[54:01] my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom
[54:03] I trust, who subdueth my people under
[54:06] me." So, he's saying that he's saying
[54:08] the Lord teaches his hands to war and
[54:10] his fingers to fight. Now, with God, God
[54:12] doesn't just give you theory. It's all
[54:15] practical lessons, right? Our God is a
[54:17] practical God. It's not a lecture uh
[54:20] hall kind of god who just teaches you
[54:22] something that you can't apply, that's
[54:24] not relatable, that's not real. No, he
[54:26] teaches you in everyday life. So, what
[54:28] our prayer should be is, Lord, teach my
[54:31] hands to war. Show me how to overcome
[54:34] this thing. Show me how to do it, Lord.
[54:37] Lord, take See, this is what we got to
[54:40] do. We got to seek the Lord to how to
[54:42] overcome our enemy. It's one thing to
[54:44] sit there and say, "Lord, deliver me.
[54:45] Help me. Deliver me." That's good. But
[54:47] it should be, "Lord, use me to overcome
[54:50] this thing in my life. Show me how how I
[54:52] can overcome." Because we have been
[54:54] given a free moral agency, right? We've
[54:57] been given a choice. God wants to use
[54:59] you to overcome your enemy.
[55:03] Amen. We got to ask him how to win. And
[55:05] ask God how how to do it. He'll show you
[55:09] the things that we fight in our own
[55:11] personal lives. God will show you how to
[55:13] do it. I believe it myself. God will
[55:16] show you. Amen. See, we can't just sit
[55:18] there and say, "Deliver me, Lord, only."
[55:19] But we should ask the Lord specifically.
[55:21] Lord, show me how to do it. And Lord,
[55:23] use the faith in my life to overcome it.
[55:26] Name your enemy. Ask God how to defeat
[55:28] your enemy. That's how David would fight
[55:30] his battles. David would be in prayer
[55:32] before fighting the Philistines. He'd
[55:34] say, "Lord, show me how to fight this
[55:35] battle. Should I go up and take them?"
[55:37] He and God says, "Go up and take them."
[55:39] Comes to another battle. Lord, show me
[55:41] how to overcome this enemy. It's a it's
[55:43] a very similar looking enemy than
[55:44] before, but things are slightly
[55:45] different. The terrain's different, all
[55:47] these things. Show me how to overcome,
[55:48] Lord. And the Lord says, "Wait till you
[55:50] hear the sound of it going through the
[55:52] malberry trees and then rise up." Right?
[55:55] So, David always waited for God to give
[55:57] him instructions how to overcome. We
[55:59] must do the same. Amen. We must do the
[56:02] same. But you see, if we're, you know,
[56:04] if we're not looking for an answer, God
[56:06] can't give us the solution. You know
[56:08] many times I've you know even even the
[56:10] source initially might not even be the
[56:12] message or the Bible but I found when
[56:15] I've come across things that have helped
[56:16] me in my life I'll actually when I read
[56:18] it I'll something will come into my
[56:20] heart that's this scripture and this
[56:21] quote I see it in the word when I see it
[56:24] there but go looking for an answer Lord
[56:27] show me how to
[56:29] overcome it's in the word anyway but you
[56:32] got to be looking I mean but don't
[56:34] compensate for those things in your life
[56:37] know God teach my hands to war. Amen.
[56:41] Face the thing. You say, "It makes me
[56:43] feel uncomfortable." That's a good thing
[56:45] cuz it's the enemy feeling
[56:46] uncomfortable. It's the enemy making you
[56:49] worried and making you fear and all
[56:51] these things cuz he realizes when you
[56:53] really stand up as a son or daughter of
[56:56] God and take dominion over him, he must
[56:58] obey your voice. He must be gone in the
[57:00] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[57:04] So, I'm just going to finish it there
[57:06] today. Let's have the musicians. I want
[57:09] to ask you that
[57:12] question. Are we
[57:17] compensating? Are we compensating for
[57:19] inner
[57:20] problems or are we actively seeking the
[57:23] Lord? Lord, give me victory over these
[57:26] things. How are you by yourself? Are you
[57:28] happy? Are you a happy Christian by
[57:30] yourself? Are you unhappy? We say,
[57:33] "Well, things can always be better."
[57:34] Sure. But are you in yourself
[57:38] happy? If you're not, say, "Lord, teach
[57:41] my hands to war. These things in my
[57:44] life, you say, "Well, it's been passed
[57:45] down in generations. There's got to be
[57:48] someone that deals with it. Why not be
[57:51] you? Oh, the trauma of my early
[57:53] childhood, the trauma of my teens, the
[57:55] trauma of this. There's someone who's
[57:57] actually going to take that trauma,
[58:00] crush it under their heel, and be
[58:02] victorious by the blood of Jesus
[58:05] Christ. How about you? How about us
[58:08] today?
[58:10] Amen. I just want to leave you with that
[58:14] question. Teach my hands to warlord.
[58:17] You're more than an overcomer. You're
[58:19] more than an overcomer. The Jews had
[58:22] Jesus with them. All they need to do is
[58:24] ask him, "Come take over, Lord. What
[58:28] about you and I? We have the Messiah in
[58:30] our midst. He's with us, even in us to
[58:32] the end of the world. So why not deal
[58:35] with your enemies as opposed to
[58:37] compensating for a
[58:39] lack?" Amen. Let's let's stand, shall
[58:42] we? This
[58:46] morning, I can't explain with
[58:54] Something
[58:55] groaning deep
[58:59] within. It must be
[59:03] God here in my
[59:06] soul. Cuz I feel the
[59:13] pull. I feel the pull.
[59:22] I hear the
[59:29] call and I know the
[59:33] spirit's
[59:35] moving
[59:36] me to
[59:38] give my all.
[59:44] He
[59:46] speaks to
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:51] me and
[59:54] I
[59:56] [Applause]
[59:59] agree. Oh Lord, please come and
[1:00:05] take control.
[1:00:08] I feel the
[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:15] home. Oh, I want to hear the word.
[1:00:21] And
[1:00:22] with each
[1:00:24] line and
[1:00:30] phrase, he is
[1:00:34] drawing me to
[1:00:37] give a
[1:00:40] higher praise.
[1:00:44] [Applause]
[1:00:47] There are
[1:00:49] deep fall to the
[1:00:53] deep like a great
[1:00:57] magnet
[1:00:59] pulling me.
[1:01:02] I know for
[1:01:04] sure that I'll reach the
[1:01:08] goal. Cuz I feel
[1:01:15] the I
[1:01:17] feel
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:23] the I hear the call.
[1:01:32] And I know the spirit is
[1:01:37] moving
[1:01:39] me to give my
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:09] control. I
[1:02:11] feel the
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:18] pool at night. I
[1:02:21] lay
[1:02:23] there and
[1:02:25] I
[1:02:26] begin to
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:33] cry. Oh, and my mind just
[1:02:38] can't explode.
[1:02:42] exactly
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:48] why I can't
[1:02:51] explain with
[1:02:55] tongue the spirit's
[1:02:59] growing
[1:03:00] deep within.
[1:03:04] Oh, it must
[1:03:07] be here in my
[1:03:11] soul. I feel love.
[1:03:19] I feel love.

[1:03:48] me. He
[1:03:50] speaks to me.
[1:03:56] Oh, and I
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:04] agree. Lord, please come and
[1:04:10] take
[1:04:11] control. Oh, I feel the
[1:04:16] P. I feel the P.
[1:04:20] I
[1:04:21] feel
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] the Yes, I
[1:04:27] do. When
[1:04:29] I
[1:04:35] call and I know the
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:42] spirit want to
[1:04:44] give my own
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:51] He
[1:04:52] speaks to
[1:04:57] me and
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:07] I come and
[1:05:11] take
[1:05:13] control. I
[1:05:15] feel
[1:05:17] the Oh, I
[1:05:20] surrender and

[1:06:16] grace. I close my eyes and feel your
[1:06:20] love and
[1:06:23] splender the comfort of your spirit
[1:06:31] embrace. Oh yes, Lord. Rain on me with
[1:06:35] your presence. Lord, you're all you're

[1:12:53] surrender. Hallelujah. Amen. You all
[1:12:55] join me in prayer. Bow our heads and
[1:12:58] Amen. Who wants a greater victory? Who
[1:13:01] doesn't want to compensate because of
[1:13:03] strongholds or troubles in our life? But
[1:13:05] who wants to say, "Lord, teach my hands
[1:13:07] to war. Lord, show me how to cast this
[1:13:10] thing out. Show me how to get victory,
[1:13:12] my God. Lord Jesus, I just want to lift
[1:13:14] everyone here into your presence,
[1:13:16] Father. We don't want to be, Lord, like
[1:13:18] the Jews when you came the first time,
[1:13:20] Lord, compensating because you weren't
[1:13:22] with them, Lord. compensating because of
[1:13:24] lack of victory, Lord. Father, we don't
[1:13:26] want to be like that. I don't want to be
[1:13:27] like that, my God. Father, I want to
[1:13:29] walk with you, Lord Jesus, spirit and in
[1:13:31] truth. Father, that you have come down
[1:13:33] among us and live in our lives like
[1:13:35] never before. Father, that problems of
[1:13:37] the past, complexes, hurts, and pains,
[1:13:39] they would not be a hindrance, but
[1:13:40] Father, they become a victory, become a
[1:13:42] trophy of your grace, dear God. Father,
[1:13:44] may you burn out all those problems in
[1:13:46] the name of Jesus Christ. Dear God, may
[1:13:48] we take every thought subject to your
[1:13:50] word, Lord Jesus. May we not just be
[1:13:52] reactive, but may we be proactive, Lord,
[1:13:54] walking with you, loving you, Lord, more
[1:13:56] than anything, Father. Oh God, I just
[1:13:58] want to commit our lives into your
[1:14:00] hands. May the power of your blood wash
[1:14:01] us all clean, dear God. Refill us with
[1:14:03] your Holy Ghost, dear God. Father, may
[1:14:06] there be no one here that's like the
[1:14:07] publican or sinner that's indifferent,
[1:14:09] Lord. But Father, may they give their
[1:14:10] lives unreservedly to you, dear God. May
[1:14:13] there be no one who buries themselves in
[1:14:15] in in in scholarship, Lord. just just
[1:14:17] looking into things that don't really
[1:14:18] matter, that don't give them overcoming
[1:14:20] power. And may there be no one here
[1:14:22] that's like a Pharisee that's added to
[1:14:23] the word and and and their level of
[1:14:25] spirituality is how well they keep it in
[1:14:27] their own human humanity. Lord, may all
[1:14:29] that be gone, Lord. And may we walk with
[1:14:32] you in spirit and in truth, Lord, in the
[1:14:34] name of Jesus Christ. As a house of
[1:14:35] hell, give way to the name of Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ. Satan, you're a defeated being.
[1:14:39] Take your hands off God's property. We
[1:14:41] rebuke you by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:43] set set the people of God free in the
[1:14:45] name of Jesus Christ. And dear God, we
[1:14:47] thank you. You've made us overcomers,
[1:14:49] Lord. Thank you, Lord. We can stand
[1:14:51] toe-to-toe with our enemy and we can
[1:14:53] conquer him because of your blood.
[1:14:54] You've made us victorious in every
[1:14:56] situation. So may we never shrink back
[1:14:58] when we see the enemy come in or bring
[1:15:00] up things from our past, but may we
[1:15:02] press the battle against them and
[1:15:03] overcome them by the word of the Lord.
[1:15:05] Granted, Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:15:07] Christ, we thank you, dear God, that we
[1:15:09] can be like Simeon and Anna. Lord,
[1:15:11] you've inspired us, Lord, to see you in
[1:15:13] this day and we can lift you up and say,
[1:15:14] "Thank you, Lord." Now, we can depart in
[1:15:16] peace because our eyes have seen your
[1:15:18] salvation. Hallelujah, Lord God. We
[1:15:20] praise your holy name. I ask, Father,
[1:15:22] when we're by ourselves, may there be
[1:15:24] such a peace and contentment in our
[1:15:26] souls, dear God. Father, may you just
[1:15:28] rule out of that, Lord, into the rest of
[1:15:30] our lives for your glory. We thank you,
[1:15:32] Lord, for this morning. Pray you'd take
[1:15:34] these chopped up thoughts, Lord, and put
[1:15:36] them by your Holy Ghost how they should
[1:15:37] be, dear God. And may we just look Lord
[1:15:40] just go from glory to glory in Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:15:46] friends. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen to you
[1:15:56] both. Amen. Praise the Lord. We serve a
[1:15:58] victorious God this
[1:16:01] morning. Amen.
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:06] And we have the authority to move
[1:16:07] forward in the name of the
[1:16:09] Lord. You know, regardless of how it
[1:16:11] might appear, what it might seem, we
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] can, that's what we're called to do is
[1:16:17] to move forward and to keep claiming the
[1:16:20] promises of
[1:16:23] God. I'm just stalling. I don't know
[1:16:25] whether I'll share something or
[1:16:30] not. Brother Aman said I should
[1:16:35] Maybe I will just because I I want to
[1:16:39] um I want to maybe encourage you because
[1:16:41] you probably are no doubt you're pro
[1:16:43] you're probably battling with something.
[1:16:45] Anyone battling with anything at the
[1:16:48] moment. Some days you feel on the
[1:16:50] mountain. Some days you're like don't
[1:16:52] know if I can do this. But every day you
[1:16:54] can do it. Every day you wake up you can
[1:16:57] do it. You can move forward. You can
[1:16:58] fight. You can press on in the Lord
[1:17:01] every day. And if you weren't supposed
[1:17:04] to be, if you weren't going to overcome
[1:17:06] it, you wouldn't be in
[1:17:08] it. That situation was put there for you
[1:17:12] to overcome. And if you if the Lord
[1:17:14] didn't think you had the capacity to
[1:17:15] overcome it, it wouldn't be in front of
[1:17:18] you. Does that make
[1:17:23] sense? This this um maybe I will I
[1:17:26] probably shouldn't do this because I
[1:17:27] might it hasn't happened yet. I might
[1:17:29] get in trouble, but I I don't think I
[1:17:30] will.
[1:17:35] Okay, I'll do
[1:17:36] it.
[1:17:38] Um, I've been trying to make this film
[1:17:40] for about two or three years now and
[1:17:42] I've kind of got we got to the I got I
[1:17:44] got it almost all done and then it was
[1:17:47] like 80% of the way there. Then I just
[1:17:49] got an onslaught of just stuff and it
[1:17:52] just like closed this thing down. And
[1:17:53] I've been battling with this thing for
[1:17:54] like 2 years trying to even just get
[1:17:56] this thing finished and it's just
[1:17:59] been a battle every I just there's no
[1:18:02] way forward man and they're like and I
[1:18:04] needed to get this I kind of just got
[1:18:06] this sound stuff done on it and that
[1:18:10] even that's a battle and then we need
[1:18:11] this all this visual stuff done on it
[1:18:13] and every person we went to to go and
[1:18:14] get the stuff done was like $150,000 to
[1:18:17] do this work. I'm like I don't have
[1:18:19] $150,000 to do the work. you know,
[1:18:22] that's a lot of money. You know, it's a
[1:18:24] hard economy and all that. You know,
[1:18:26] like 10 grand, you could pull it
[1:18:27] together somewhere. You know, it's it's
[1:18:28] not it's doable. But when you get to
[1:18:30] that sort of money, you're like, this is
[1:18:32] you sort of get this you don't get
[1:18:33] despondent, but you think this is a big
[1:18:35] it's a big thing to overcome, you
[1:18:38] know,
[1:18:41] and I know this might seem like a
[1:18:44] natural thing, but it's just it's
[1:18:47] it's at some point along the line, I
[1:18:49] thought, I'm just going to press on. And
[1:18:51] the Lord said to do it, I'm just going
[1:18:52] to keep pressing on regardless of how it
[1:18:54] might appear. It's not going to happen.
[1:18:55] I don't care. I'm just going to press
[1:18:56] on. The Lord's going to make a way where
[1:18:57] there seems to be no way. That's what
[1:18:59] he's going to do, you know, and it seems
[1:19:01] to me like there's no way, but he's
[1:19:02] going to the Lord is going to make a
[1:19:04] way. And I and I I started just changing
[1:19:07] the way I thought, you know, to think in
[1:19:09] every situation the Lord can make a way.
[1:19:10] I woke up in the morning thinking the
[1:19:12] Lord can make a way. It's just the whole
[1:19:14] mindset is just changing. I'm thinking,
[1:19:16] Lord, you can make a way every single
[1:19:17] day. This is what the testimony is. It's
[1:19:19] not about what happened. It's about this
[1:19:20] mindset. It's about thinking, Lord, I'm
[1:19:22] going to put you first no matter what.
[1:19:23] You're going to be first. I'm looking to
[1:19:25] you and I'm not looking to my problems.
[1:19:26] I'm not looking to anything. You're
[1:19:27] going to make a way. I'm going to look
[1:19:29] to you. I don't care what it seems like.
[1:19:32] You know, and this is this applies to
[1:19:33] your situation to everything. We just
[1:19:35] look to the Lord. That's my advice is
[1:19:37] just Lord, I'm victorious. I'm a son of
[1:19:39] God. Whether I feel good, if I feel
[1:19:42] good, I'm a son of God or a daughter of
[1:19:44] God and I'm victorious. If I feel bad,
[1:19:45] I'm still a son of God. I'm still
[1:19:47] victorious.
[1:19:49] If I'm winning, I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:19:51] victorious. If I'm losing, I'm a son of
[1:19:53] God. I'm
[1:19:54] victorious. That's that's that's how
[1:19:56] what my mentality is changing to be.
[1:19:58] Lord, in every situation, don't matter
[1:20:00] how I feel, I'm victorious. Lord, I'm a
[1:20:01] son of God. I'm victorious in
[1:20:03] you. So, we keep I keep trying to press
[1:20:06] on this thing, but there seems like no
[1:20:07] way open, no doors, no nothing.
[1:20:09] Everything we went to was just like,
[1:20:11] "Yeah, give us a call. 150 grand, we'll
[1:20:13] do it for you." It's like, "Ain't got to
[1:20:14] call 150 grand." you know, then we even
[1:20:18] did this fundraising campaign to try and
[1:20:20] get some money and and and people have
[1:20:22] done put stuff in. You know, it's been
[1:20:23] good. It's been it's been all right.
[1:20:25] But,
[1:20:26] um, then this guy dropped me and I did I
[1:20:29] posted something on the pizza factory
[1:20:31] Facebook page. I I'm doing this, by the
[1:20:33] way. And a couple of days later, I got a
[1:20:35] text from this guy on the page. He said,
[1:20:37] "Oh, I'm a VFX artist. If Sup," he
[1:20:40] called himself. He's like, "Oh, if you
[1:20:41] want some help, I can maybe let's catch
[1:20:43] up. I can maybe help you out with this
[1:20:45] thing that and I didn't take much of it.
[1:20:48] I thought I've I've had these guys ask
[1:20:50] me stuff before and I but I did reply
[1:20:52] back to this guy. No, yeah, we'll catch
[1:20:53] up. He said, I know. He said, I come
[1:20:55] into the pizza factory all the time and
[1:20:56] buy pizza. Didn't realize you made film.
[1:20:58] I'm a VFX guy. Can I can I come and see
[1:21:02] you and let's catch up and talk about
[1:21:03] it. I ended up meeting this guy uh
[1:21:07] yesterday actually and it's it turns out
[1:21:10] so this guy's a no no one knew this
[1:21:12] guy's an Academy Award-winning VFX
[1:21:15] artist like he's won you can see him on
[1:21:18] on YouTube with his Academy Award to win
[1:21:20] this win an award for VFX and he's and
[1:21:23] it must be the law cuz he said look I've
[1:21:24] got spare time during the week I sit
[1:21:26] around nothing to do and I get bored cuz
[1:21:28] he oversees about a thousand guys he's
[1:21:30] like I get bored
[1:21:32] um and I want some work to do and I'd
[1:21:34] like to just do a project for free. Can
[1:21:36] I just do it? He's got he works down a
[1:21:38] wetter and he's like, but
[1:21:41] but it just you couldn't plan it, you
[1:21:45] know, like you couldn't say, "Oh, I'll
[1:21:46] make that line up." And it's it's not
[1:21:48] the testimony, but it's the fact that,
[1:21:49] you know, even when there seems like
[1:21:51] there's no way, the Lord's making a way.
[1:21:54] I didn't know the guy was coming and
[1:21:55] eating pizza for months. He was coming
[1:21:57] eating pizza. He lives down the road
[1:21:58] from me. The Lord was making a way when
[1:22:00] it didn't, you couldn't see it.
[1:22:02] Just don't ever doubt. Don't ever be
[1:22:05] despondent. Just continue to trust in
[1:22:06] the Lord. Every situation he's working
[1:22:08] in your life. And if you didn't think
[1:22:10] you could go through it, he wouldn't put
[1:22:12] you through
[1:22:12] it. He's got confidence in you. He's got
[1:22:16] confidence in you. And he knows you. He
[1:22:19] knows what's inside you. Sometimes he
[1:22:22] just makes you fight a little harder,
[1:22:24] get a little stronger, but he's a good
[1:22:27] God. He's a good God. So, um, yeah.
[1:22:31] Yeah, let's just press the metal. Let's
[1:22:33] encourage one another. As brother Ben
[1:22:34] was saying to, let's not get critical of
[1:22:36] one another. Life's hard enough. There's
[1:22:38] enough critics out there. Let's
[1:22:39] encourage one another every day. Let's
[1:22:42] encourage and exhort and just build each
[1:22:44] other up and bless, you know? We don't
[1:22:46] need to tear each other down, man.
[1:22:47] There's plenty of people to tear us
[1:22:48] down. Let's build each other up and just
[1:22:51] be be so happy to see each other and
[1:22:53] just, you know, just we're in this
[1:22:55] together and we're going to be we're all
[1:22:57] going to we're all going to walk out of
[1:22:58] here together and we're going to walk
[1:23:00] out of here victorious
[1:23:02] cuz that's who we are. Amen. Let's
[1:23:05] just let's just pray this morning, Lord.
[1:23:08] Lord, we just thank you that Lord for
[1:23:10] your grace, Lord, sometimes we go
[1:23:12] through life and it seems
[1:23:15] like Lord that we don't understand
[1:23:18] understand your ways. sometimes, Lord.
[1:23:19] But we have a confidence that your ways
[1:23:21] are far above our ways, Lord. And
[1:23:24] that that we have a confidence that in
[1:23:26] every situation, Lord, you're you're
[1:23:28] still God in every situation that we're
[1:23:30] in, Lord. And we want this message to be
[1:23:33] real to us. We want to know you
[1:23:35] personally, Lord, and walk with you
[1:23:36] daily, Lord, and just be at rest. And
[1:23:38] and
[1:23:39] and Lord, be victorious in every
[1:23:42] situation. We don't just want a theory,
[1:23:44] but we want we want the reality of you
[1:23:45] in our life, Lord. And and may that be
[1:23:47] each one of our testimony that we know
[1:23:49] you and the power of your resurrection,
[1:23:51] Lord. And that our our children could
[1:23:53] see that too. Not just see a bunch of
[1:23:54] words, but to see a life lived, Lord,
[1:23:56] and a Lord, we're not always victorious,
[1:23:58] Lord, but we're we're not always up, but
[1:24:00] Lord, we can always trust in you and we
[1:24:01] can always walk forward in your name,
[1:24:03] Lord. So, we just thank you, Lord, for
[1:24:05] your goodness to us this morning. I pray
[1:24:06] a blessing upon each one. Give us
[1:24:08] strength, Lord, as we press the battle
[1:24:09] ahead. As we as we see the world
[1:24:12] shaking, Lord, we know that we we we're
[1:24:13] on a shore and a steadfast foundation
[1:24:16] which is your word and which is we're
[1:24:17] holding on to you, Lord. So, we just
[1:24:19] want to I just want to commit each one
[1:24:20] to your hands, Lord. May you just bless
[1:24:21] each one this morning. I pray in Jesus
[1:24:23] wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:24:26] Lord. You're dismissed in Jesus name
[1:24:27] this morning.
