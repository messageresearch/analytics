[45:58] word tonight you may have your seats
[46:00] we're also going to read from from
[46:02] revelations 5
[46:05] a good a good portion of it as well i
[46:07] want to talk about the working of the
[46:09] high priest
[46:11] just just just one aspect of it and um i
[46:14] just pray the lord would you know
[46:15] something that brother
[46:16] adrian said at camp which really blessed
[46:18] me so i just want to
[46:19] go into it maybe uh just a bit more but
[46:22] um
[46:22] we read here in in revelations 5 and 1
[46:25] we're just going to read down to verse
[46:27] 10
[46:28] probably i trust a familiar piece of
[46:30] scripture to us all
[46:31] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[46:33] sat on the throne a book written within
[46:35] and on the back side sealed with seven
[46:36] seals
[46:37] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[46:39] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[46:40] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[46:42] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[46:44] neither under the earth was able to open
[46:46] the book neither to look
[46:47] thereon says the title deed to the earth
[46:49] but also represents you
[46:51] and i went much because no man was found
[46:53] worthy to open and to read the book
[46:55] neither to look thereon
[46:56] and one of the elders sat unto me weep
[46:58] not behold the line of the tribe of
[47:00] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[47:02] to open the book
[47:03] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[47:05] i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[47:07] throne and of the four beasts in the
[47:09] midst of the elders
[47:10] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[47:13] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[47:15] seven spirits of god sent forth into all
[47:17] the earth
[47:18] and he came and he took the book out of
[47:20] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[47:22] throne
[47:22] and when he had taken the book the four
[47:24] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[47:26] down before the lamb
[47:28] every one of them having harps and
[47:30] golden vials full of odors which are the
[47:32] prayer of saints
[47:33] and they sung a new song saying they are
[47:35] worthy to take the book
[47:37] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[47:40] was slain and has redeemed us to god
[47:42] by the blood out of every kindred and
[47:44] people a tongan people
[47:46] and nation and has made us unto our god
[47:49] kings and priests and we shall reign
[47:52] on the earth amen so we read here in in
[47:55] uh
[47:55] exodus chapter 28 where where where the
[47:58] we're the high priest because we know
[48:00] that the high priest
[48:01] function was essential in the worship in
[48:03] israel where even though they
[48:05] they would bring their sin offerings and
[48:07] they would do various offerings through
[48:08] the year
[48:09] but the high priest once a year with
[48:11] blood went into the holy of holies on
[48:13] behalf of the people
[48:14] to atone for their sins and it was only
[48:16] the high priest that could do it but
[48:18] notice now that you're the high priest
[48:20] he didn't just go in
[48:22] uh you know he was you know you know
[48:24] just for himself
[48:25] only but but he was carrying the names
[48:27] of the people upon his heart
[48:29] and so now you know what i love about
[48:32] this is
[48:32] is you know to me it's showing that
[48:36] you know our lord jesus christ when he
[48:38] was on the cross we're on his mind we're
[48:40] on his heart
[48:41] and he went into the he you know he
[48:42] ascended up into glory
[48:44] with us on his heart i mean so so he
[48:47] atoned for
[48:48] our sins with us on his heart you know
[48:49] it wasn't just a business transaction
[48:51] just something just
[48:52] going through the motions but there are
[48:54] people to be redeemed that are on his
[48:55] heart
[48:56] and that's why he did what he did so the
[48:58] high priest went in
[48:59] with the names of the people of israel
[49:01] the tribes on his heart
[49:03] and he went and he offered the blood and
[49:04] when he came out
[49:06] then the people were accepted because
[49:08] the offering was accepted and
[49:10] if you're if you're of the tribe of of
[49:12] reuben or gad or you know all of the
[49:14] tribes if you were part of that tribe
[49:16] i mean your sins were washed away
[49:18] because the high priest
[49:19] his offering was accepted because he is
[49:21] carrying your name when he went to the
[49:23] presence of god
[49:24] and it's the same thing with you and i
[49:26] amen remember our
[49:27] our names in the lamb's book of life
[49:30] hallelujah and so he went into glory
[49:32] with his own blood with our names on his
[49:34] heart to atone for your knight
[49:36] and what i love about this atonement is
[49:38] that once a year was done
[49:40] and and and what was tied in with this
[49:43] once a year
[49:44] offering that the high priest did was
[49:46] also was a year of jubilee
[49:48] so now the high priest went in he
[49:50] offered the blood he came out then
[49:52] there's a blowing of trump it's a
[49:53] jubilee trumpet
[49:54] and so if your name was on the high
[49:56] priest's heart when he went in
[49:58] then if you heard that jubilee trumpet
[50:00] you had a you had a choice to walk free
[50:02] or to stay bound
[50:03] i mean so it was a time of release where
[50:05] every man would go back to his
[50:07] possession so what he fell from
[50:09] he had a right to go back and possess
[50:11] what he fell from now
[50:12] we are the sons and daughters the most
[50:14] high god you know we are the children
[50:16] of adam if you can trace it back
[50:18] spiritually who is the son of god now
[50:20] and now the prophet tells us that
[50:22] everything adam lost we have received
[50:25] i mean so now we have heard a jubilee
[50:27] trumpet in this hour
[50:28] where we can return back to our
[50:30] possession
[50:31] which is what eternal life godship over
[50:33] the earth amen
[50:35] you know nature i mean i mean dominion
[50:37] over satan and all of hell and thing
[50:39] we can return back to eternal life
[50:41] hallelujah that everything adam lost now
[50:44] we can receive hallelujah so
[50:48] you know i know it's a bit of a bit of a
[50:49] reading in exodus but i just wanted you
[50:50] to see that he went
[50:51] in with the people's names on us over
[50:54] his heart
[50:55] not just on his chest with his over his
[50:57] heart hallelujah and because the blood
[50:59] was offered it was accepted
[51:01] i meant the people were accepted now
[51:04] this
[51:04] this scene that we read here in in
[51:07] revelations
[51:08] 5 brother braham says that the lamb
[51:10] taking the book it's the most sublime
[51:12] piece of scripture it's one of the mo it
[51:15] is the most sublime
[51:16] act in all of scripture where where what
[51:19] what our lord jesus purchased at down
[51:21] calvary
[51:22] now he comes to claim it hallelujah
[51:24] because john looked around you know he
[51:26] you know if we
[51:27] if we go back you know we can look in
[51:29] revelations 1 how it says that he was
[51:32] in the spirit on the lord's day and we
[51:34] know this is not the
[51:35] lord's day this is man's day right so he
[51:38] is actually transported into the future
[51:40] in the spirit and uh we know also the
[51:43] day of the lord is not
[51:44] saturday a sabbath amen because the
[51:47] sabbath is just a shadow
[51:49] speaking of a eternal rest
[51:53] amen it's not you know the lord so so
[51:55] john wasn't in the spirit on a saturday
[51:57] or a sabbath
[51:58] right he was on the spirit in the lord's
[52:00] day so he was taken forward in time
[52:02] up until eternity and god was going to
[52:05] show john
[52:06] god's plan of redemption hollywood what
[52:09] has this got to do with us if we can see
[52:11] our god's plan
[52:12] and us in god's plan it should give us
[52:14] such a faith
[52:15] that if we made it over there if we came
[52:17] from god we're going to go back to god
[52:19] and whatever the devil does in time it
[52:21] doesn't matter too much really
[52:23] because we're going to overcome him and
[52:25] in reality we have already overcome him
[52:27] hallelujah so as i said he he wasn't
[52:30] there on a saturday
[52:32] he was in the lord's day now paul would
[52:34] say in
[52:35] in colossians 2 he says let no man
[52:37] therefore this is colossians 2 and 16
[52:39] let no man therefore judge you and meet
[52:41] her and drink a respective and holy day
[52:43] or the new moon or the or of the sabbath
[52:45] days
[52:46] which are a shadow of things to come but
[52:48] the body is of christ so he's saying
[52:49] even the sabbath
[52:50] keeping the sabbath was just a shadow
[52:52] but now we have a reality because we
[52:54] know that the sabbath day
[52:56] is when the lord rested from his works
[52:59] right and god
[53:00] god held it as a holy day that man
[53:02] should rest from his works and keep that
[53:03] day doing no work
[53:04] now that was just pointing to the
[53:06] reality is when a believer really
[53:08] receives the holy ghost
[53:10] they cease from their own works and they
[53:12] enter into rest
[53:14] amen you know if you read hebrews 3 and
[53:16] 4 the apostle paul talks about it so
[53:18] when god comes and takes over your life
[53:21] you cease from your own works
[53:23] it's not you trying to be the christian
[53:24] it's him being the christian in you
[53:26] hallelujah so it's now him taking over
[53:29] and working
[53:30] through us hallelujah amen so
[53:34] john we know uh in the book of
[53:36] revelation as a symbol
[53:38] himself now i've probably covered these
[53:40] things but you know
[53:41] maybe i'm just getting old apparently
[53:42] i'm in my late 30s so you know
[53:44] i repeat myself but these things are
[53:46] very essential because it's more than
[53:48] just learning a teaching but
[53:49] you know john himself is a symbol in the
[53:51] book brother brown would tell us in
[53:53] revelations chapter 4 this is in 1960
[53:56] notice john being taken up immediately
[53:58] after the church age
[53:59] was a type of the raptured church
[54:01] immediately after the church age is over
[54:02] this ladies and church age
[54:04] then comes the rapture the church goes
[54:06] up like john did into the presence of
[54:08] god
[54:09] he says that just winds my soul around
[54:11] caught up at the rapture of the church
[54:13] i mean so he's saying that at the end of
[54:14] the seventh church age there's a
[54:16] translation of the living and the dead
[54:18] saints hallelujah
[54:19] so john is a symbol in the book and
[54:22] that's why
[54:22] you can take the prophet's ministry and
[54:24] you can take what the angel came and saw
[54:26] john
[54:27] as he brother and preached on it here's
[54:29] the future home this is what ends up
[54:30] with the devil yeah i saw this and saw
[54:32] this and
[54:33] you know you know you can actually see
[54:34] what the angel showed show
[54:36] john is what the prophet preaching
[54:38] showed us because john is a
[54:40] symbol of the bride amen and so we are
[54:42] in the book of revelation
[54:44] hallelujah that's why you know even the
[54:46] book yo it is it is the bride's book
[54:48] it's the bride's portion
[54:50] hallelujah so it's a very important book
[54:52] it was in symbol but now it's no longer
[54:54] a mystery anymore it's been revealed
[54:56] amen so it doesn't matter what people
[54:59] argue about well this symbol means this
[55:00] this means this means
[55:02] we've had a vindicated prophet unless
[55:04] this day tell us what it means i mean so
[55:06] just like i said on sunday the umpire
[55:08] himself has come on the scene and said
[55:10] this is what it is
[55:11] hallelujah because it because brotherham
[55:13] said it wasn't me as god himself
[55:16] hallelujah and you know any ministry
[55:17] that says now if i've said the truth let
[55:19] him come and back it up what i've said
[55:20] is truth and god comes down in a
[55:22] unique scriptural way and vindicates it
[55:25] i'd say well i'll take that
[55:27] i think i think that's a good one to
[55:29] listen to i mean so so
[55:31] john has taken it so he's assembled
[55:33] himself in the book
[55:35] and he's lifted up into the eternities
[55:38] and then he's now looking around to see
[55:40] now who can actually take this title
[55:42] deed back that adam lost
[55:44] now there has been one in the eternities
[55:46] there that's been
[55:48] our high priest where where um jesus
[55:51] would tell mary on the morning of the
[55:52] resurrection where
[55:54] where she went to the tomb and she looks
[55:56] around and you know she's all downcast
[55:58] and broken and
[55:59] you know and then she turns around she
[56:01] sees a young man maybe looking about 18
[56:03] to 21 years old you know and
[56:05] you know she thinks that he's the
[56:06] gardener but then he's he says one word
[56:08] to her changes her whole life
[56:10] calls her by name mary her eyes come
[56:12] open rabona you know messiah it's you
[56:14] and then but then she is told by him you
[56:17] know don't touch me
[56:18] because i've not ascended yet so he had
[56:20] to go up into the holy s
[56:22] into heaven itself i mean to be received
[56:25] right amen but he says go tell my
[56:27] disciples
[56:28] that i sent to my god and your god my
[56:31] father and your father
[56:32] hallelujah so so he had to go up there
[56:35] right then he came back down we know and
[56:37] then he said to thomas you know
[56:38] touch that put your hand in my side
[56:40] touch me you know verify me by
[56:42] contact and then and then thomas had the
[56:44] revelation that i wish the church world
[56:46] had he said my lord and my god
[56:48] wasn't a second person of trinity he was
[56:50] god hallelujah
[56:53] i mean so and then he ascended on high
[56:55] and the physical
[56:56] body of jesus christ is at the right
[56:59] hand of the majesty on high
[57:01] and we so so we do not now he is not a
[57:03] dead form
[57:05] he's ever living to make intercession
[57:07] for us amen he's ever living making
[57:10] intercession for us
[57:11] amen and he is his spirit is down upon
[57:13] the earth
[57:14] working out things for us to leave now
[57:16] what i love about it is
[57:18] is we can take this and you know it was
[57:20] on my heart quite a lot to go look in
[57:22] the life of joseph we know joseph
[57:24] parallels
[57:25] you know the you know as a as a type of
[57:28] jesus christ real perfectly
[57:30] amen hallelujah so so if you look at his
[57:33] life you know he was he was a spiritual
[57:36] spiritual man had dreams interpreted
[57:39] them
[57:39] his natural brethren hated him and they
[57:42] hated him without a cause
[57:44] just like the jews hated jesus you know
[57:46] he was sold for about 30 pieces of
[57:47] silver
[57:48] just like jesus was amen but then you
[57:51] know and then and then when he was in
[57:53] prison the second
[57:54] time you know the butler was um now i
[57:56] always get things mixed up normally
[57:58] the baker was killed you know and they
[58:01] and they and the butler wasn't just like
[58:02] you know one thief was pardoned received
[58:04] eternal life on the cross the other one
[58:06] went to hell you know was rejected you
[58:08] know died you know but then he by then
[58:10] after he was ascended to the right hand
[58:11] of god jesus was
[58:13] joseph was ascended to the right hand of
[58:15] pharaoh amen you know he had a covenant
[58:17] uh you know joseph had a covenant you
[58:19] know coat of many colors just like
[58:22] our lord jesus has a covenant right i
[58:25] mean so but then but then
[58:26] in that time he takes a gentile bride
[58:31] after the rejection by his brethren and
[58:33] him being down in egypt he takes a
[58:35] gentile
[58:36] bride but then during this time of
[58:39] trouble
[58:40] because there's a great famine it was a
[58:42] couple of years into this famine
[58:44] that that that that he finally revealed
[58:46] himself to his brother
[58:48] you know you know to to his brethren it
[58:50] says in june
[58:51] um uh genesis 45 and one then joseph
[58:54] could not refrain himself
[58:55] but for all of them that stood by him
[58:57] and he cried caused every man to go out
[59:00] from me
[59:01] and stood there with no man with him
[59:03] while joseph made himself known
[59:05] unto his brethren and he wept aloud in
[59:07] the egyptians in the house of pharaoh
[59:09] heard
[59:10] so where is his wife in the palace
[59:14] so because remember when when the lord
[59:17] had had some names on his heart in the
[59:19] land's book of life it's not just a
[59:20] gentile bride
[59:22] there's the jews there as well the 144
[59:24] 000 there's the elected ones they're on
[59:25] his heart too
[59:26] so now there has to be blood for them as
[59:29] well
[59:30] right so now he so so he he reveals
[59:33] himself to a gentile bride hello gentile
[59:35] bride how are you
[59:36] i remember when he goes to reveal
[59:38] himself to his jewish brethren we're up
[59:40] in the palace
[59:41] right so rapture takes place we're up in
[59:43] the palace and he comes back down and
[59:45] they ask him where'd you get those
[59:46] wounds
[59:48] in the house of my friends as the
[59:49] scriptures in their well like uh you
[59:51] know family apart everything like a you
[59:53] know for only uh yeah
[59:54] you know for a son that's being lost in
[59:56] song because they realize that they
[59:57] crucified the very god that they were
[59:59] looking for
[1:00:00] i mean but it was in a time of trouble
[1:00:02] that this happened you know it was a
[1:00:03] time of
[1:00:04] famine and that famine did not just grip
[1:00:06] egypt but it gripped the whole world
[1:00:07] around it you know that's why
[1:00:09] that's why the you know um his brothers
[1:00:11] came from canaan down into
[1:00:13] egypt because there's a famine there
[1:00:15] also so there's a time of trouble upon
[1:00:18] the earth but there's a
[1:00:19] there's a gathering in this time of
[1:00:20] trouble now we're facing big trouble
[1:00:23] upon the earth
[1:00:24] nature's broken the scripture says that
[1:00:26] creation travails until the
[1:00:28] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:00:29] so it's not a surprise that nature's
[1:00:31] falling apart
[1:00:32] i mean we're you know the whole world is
[1:00:34] facing nuclear war
[1:00:36] right there's been a lot of wars and
[1:00:38] rumors of wars before but this is a time
[1:00:40] where the whole world can
[1:00:41] annihilate itself right there's you know
[1:00:44] there's
[1:00:44] economic collapse on the horizon
[1:00:48] country's collapsing nature's collapsing
[1:00:51] so it's a time of trouble right but in
[1:00:54] this time of trouble there's a gathering
[1:00:56] hallelujah amen because
[1:01:00] joseph had some names on his heart
[1:01:04] hallelujah and then so he said so so all
[1:01:07] of the house of pharaoh hurt and then
[1:01:09] verse 3 of 45 and joseph said unto his
[1:01:12] brethren
[1:01:12] i am joseph does my father yet live and
[1:01:15] his brethren could not answer him for
[1:01:16] they were troubled at his presence
[1:01:18] and joseph said unto his brethren come
[1:01:20] near to me i pray you they came there he
[1:01:22] said i am joseph your brother whom you
[1:01:24] sold into egypt
[1:01:26] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[1:01:27] with yourselves that ye sold me hither
[1:01:29] for god did send me before you to
[1:01:31] preserve life
[1:01:33] for there for these two years had the
[1:01:35] famine been in the land and yet there
[1:01:37] are five years
[1:01:38] in which there shall neither be earring
[1:01:40] nor harvest
[1:01:42] amen brother ram says and we would see
[1:01:44] jesus david was anointed with the spirit
[1:01:46] of god the prophets was anointed with
[1:01:47] the spirit of god
[1:01:48] that was christ and joseph that made him
[1:01:50] portray christ exactly
[1:01:52] sold for about 30 pieces of silver loved
[1:01:54] by the father hated by the brethren in
[1:01:56] his prison
[1:01:57] in this prison house like christ was on
[1:01:58] the cross one was saved
[1:02:00] uh and the baker and the butler and one
[1:02:02] was saved the other one was lost the
[1:02:04] same thing
[1:02:04] said at the right hand of pharaoh and
[1:02:06] every time he went forth the trumpet
[1:02:08] sounded
[1:02:08] everyone bow the knee joseph is coming
[1:02:10] and no man could get to pharaoh
[1:02:12] only through joseph that was christ in
[1:02:14] joseph
[1:02:15] i mean it's all down through that time
[1:02:17] of trouble there but he got a gentile
[1:02:19] bride
[1:02:20] hallelujah amen so now
[1:02:24] and he says this he says and here we
[1:02:26] find the jews under persecution
[1:02:28] didn't know where they stand now but
[1:02:30] they're coming back speaking of going
[1:02:31] back to the homeland
[1:02:32] and when and when they do see the
[1:02:34] atonement appear the bible said when
[1:02:36] they seen it
[1:02:37] they said they would separate one home
[1:02:40] from another and weep for days like a
[1:02:42] family that's lost their only son
[1:02:44] where did you get those wounds he said
[1:02:45] in the house of my friend see
[1:02:47] remember the bride is already in heaven
[1:02:49] joseph's wife was in the palace
[1:02:51] and joseph dismissed everything from
[1:02:53] around him and made himself known to his
[1:02:55] brothers you see
[1:02:56] his wife and children and them that was
[1:02:58] in the palace when he returns back
[1:03:00] to make himself known to the jews there
[1:03:02] is the atonement there is your sound
[1:03:03] trumpet
[1:03:04] there is where they say oh what is it
[1:03:06] there's the atonement
[1:03:08] where where's them wounds come from
[1:03:10] there it is in the house of my friends
[1:03:12] remember what joseph's brothers said why
[1:03:14] they said now we're all be killed sure
[1:03:16] enough
[1:03:16] we did that we did that evil like that
[1:03:19] he said no god did this to save life you
[1:03:21] remember the story in genesis c
[1:03:23] so did he so he did it this way to save
[1:03:26] life
[1:03:26] uh to save the life of the gentiles the
[1:03:29] bride said i've got them in the house of
[1:03:31] my friend don't be angry see
[1:03:32] don't be afraid of yourself they say oh
[1:03:35] my did we actually miss seeing him
[1:03:38] was that the atonement and we missed it
[1:03:40] oh god they said they just separate
[1:03:42] themselves and mourn for days
[1:03:44] what is it the atonement sadness this
[1:03:46] time the coming of the making known
[1:03:48] atonement
[1:03:49] is not the regular atonement being
[1:03:50] killed like in leviticus 16
[1:03:52] but leviticus 23 is a mourning time of
[1:03:54] their sins and their sins was
[1:03:56] they rejected it amen so
[1:04:00] there is a so during this time now there
[1:04:03] is a gathering of a people
[1:04:05] now i trust this is not news to you you
[1:04:07] know because we're kind of living out
[1:04:09] this gathering of a people
[1:04:11] hallelujah amen because it's got to be
[1:04:13] manifested upon the earth so
[1:04:15] so john was taken up and then brother
[1:04:18] braham says it's the most sublime
[1:04:20] act in the scripture is when the lamb
[1:04:23] takes the book he says notice
[1:04:25] he is not an animal this is what we just
[1:04:27] read in your revelations five it's all
[1:04:29] symbolic remember
[1:04:30] he took the book out of the right hand
[1:04:31] of him that sat upon the throne who was
[1:04:33] it the owner the original owner that had
[1:04:35] the book of redemption in his right hand
[1:04:37] and no angel no angelic being nothing
[1:04:39] else could take the place and this
[1:04:40] bloody lamb walked out
[1:04:42] and took the book out of his hand phew
[1:04:44] what was it brother
[1:04:45] this is the most sublime thing in the
[1:04:47] scripture an act that not an
[1:04:48] angel nothing could do it and the lamb
[1:04:51] come
[1:04:51] and took it from the right hand of him
[1:04:53] that sat upon the throne what is it now
[1:04:55] belongs to the lamb amen god's law
[1:04:57] required it
[1:04:58] he's the one that holds it god's law
[1:05:00] requires a kinsmen redeemer
[1:05:02] i mean that's why he he god became man
[1:05:05] amen to redeem us back to god amen here
[1:05:08] to be born to be one of us i mean to
[1:05:09] take the sins of the world upon himself
[1:05:11] and the lamb came out holding it i'm
[1:05:13] their kinsmen i am their redeemer
[1:05:15] i mean i have made intercession for them
[1:05:18] now i've come to claim
[1:05:19] their rights for them amen there's the
[1:05:21] only one i've come to claim their rights
[1:05:24] and that they have a right to everything
[1:05:26] that was lost in the fall
[1:05:28] i've paid the price so he says now i
[1:05:29] have come to
[1:05:31] i mean i've come to claim their rights
[1:05:33] for them others it's not us claiming our
[1:05:35] own rights it's actually god coming to
[1:05:37] claim your rights
[1:05:38] it means if our rights are overcoming
[1:05:40] power he says i've come to make claims
[1:05:41] for that
[1:05:42] amen healing of the sick whatever it may
[1:05:44] be deliverance or
[1:05:45] peace of mind joy whatever it may be
[1:05:48] amen our rights in the
[1:05:49] in the holy ghost says i have come to
[1:05:51] claim their rights for them
[1:05:53] hallelujah amy says now notice requires
[1:05:57] the kinsmen redeemer and the redeemer
[1:05:58] kinsmen redeemer
[1:06:00] must be born of the human race there
[1:06:02] that leaves us out on a limb
[1:06:04] you think about it because who could be
[1:06:06] born into the human race worthy to take
[1:06:07] the book
[1:06:08] because we're all born in sin we're all
[1:06:09] we're all trapped to begin with how can
[1:06:11] we
[1:06:11] how can we ever do it we can't produce
[1:06:13] it i mean in our own ability that's why
[1:06:15] it leaves us out on a limb
[1:06:17] but let me sound the trumpet to you the
[1:06:19] virgin birth produced the product
[1:06:21] amen the virgin birth produced our
[1:06:22] kinsmen redeemer none other but the
[1:06:25] almighty god became emmanuel one of us
[1:06:28] emmanuel
[1:06:29] the kinsman redeemer was met you see how
[1:06:31] god
[1:06:32] makes a requirement and there's nothing
[1:06:34] we can do
[1:06:35] who's ever who's ever come to that
[1:06:37] conclusion
[1:06:38] he says be perfect as my father in
[1:06:42] heaven is perfect that's a requirement
[1:06:44] oh boy that puts us out on a limb how
[1:06:46] can i be perfect i know how i think i
[1:06:48] know my family is my whatever i think my
[1:06:50] success is doesn't amount to hillary
[1:06:52] beans
[1:06:52] right you know but you know because our
[1:06:54] own righteousness is but filthy rags in
[1:06:56] his sight
[1:06:57] right but you know so so this puts us
[1:06:58] out on a limb be
[1:07:00] perfect even as my father in heaven is
[1:07:02] perfect so we can't do it ourselves the
[1:07:04] only way is for god to send a perfect
[1:07:05] sacrifice
[1:07:06] and for us to receive that sacrifice
[1:07:08] receive that perfection of the sacrifice
[1:07:10] and then because the sacrifice is
[1:07:12] accepted and it's perfect
[1:07:14] then we become perfect through our
[1:07:15] sacrifice hallelujah
[1:07:18] amen there's nothing we can do but then
[1:07:21] grace steps in
[1:07:22] and overshadows the law and produces the
[1:07:24] product
[1:07:26] amen and hallelujah oh when you get over
[1:07:29] home when i
[1:07:30] get my little cabin down there that
[1:07:32] brother neville sings about when you
[1:07:33] hear something down there one morning
[1:07:35] amazing grace how sweet the sound that
[1:07:37] save the wretch like me
[1:07:39] you say oh brother brown made it there
[1:07:41] he is see oh my it's grace it taught my
[1:07:43] heart to fear
[1:07:44] it was grace my fears relieved how
[1:07:46] precious did that grace appear the
[1:07:48] hour i first believed wait till we get
[1:07:50] down to it oh in a moment oh my the book
[1:07:53] now when he speaks about the taking of
[1:07:55] the book this is why it becomes a
[1:07:57] personal thing
[1:07:58] he says the book of ruth gives a
[1:08:00] beautiful picture of this
[1:08:02] so it goes from just so it's not
[1:08:04] actually
[1:08:05] a book this is it too because this was
[1:08:08] sealed with seven seals right but it
[1:08:10] he actually takes from just a book of
[1:08:13] ink on paper to a person
[1:08:15] he's saying the book of ruth gives a
[1:08:17] beautiful picture of this what is the
[1:08:19] lamb
[1:08:20] taking the book he says hell no how boaz
[1:08:24] he says he says know me had lost the
[1:08:26] estate
[1:08:27] uh you know you heard me preaching i
[1:08:28] haven't you raise up your hands if you
[1:08:30] heard me preacher you understand see
[1:08:31] boaz
[1:08:32] had to become a redeemer so so ruth i
[1:08:35] mean i mean so naomi we know they left
[1:08:37] israel they went to moab
[1:08:38] you know naomi's um husband died
[1:08:42] two sons died and but but before the
[1:08:45] sons died one of them married
[1:08:46] um ruth and then and then after they
[1:08:49] just widows nomi hears that there's now
[1:08:51] grain again in israel and she says i'm
[1:08:53] just gonna go back home
[1:08:54] and ruth made the decision no me will
[1:08:56] you die i
[1:08:57] die where you go i go your god be my god
[1:09:00] i'm following you
[1:09:01] and they just happen to find themselves
[1:09:03] in a place
[1:09:04] where there is a near kinsman that could
[1:09:06] actually fix this whole mess that they
[1:09:08] found their lives in
[1:09:10] halia so now here we were we were born
[1:09:12] in this mess
[1:09:13] amen that's a mess it was a dog's
[1:09:15] breakfast to say the least you know
[1:09:17] it was a big mess but we needed someone
[1:09:19] to come and fix this great big mess
[1:09:21] hallelujah so so so ruth who is a
[1:09:24] moabitess the law says that moabites
[1:09:26] can't even come into the congregation of
[1:09:27] israel remember grace overshadows the
[1:09:29] law
[1:09:30] hallelujah and then here comes boaz
[1:09:32] who's actually near kisman to naomi
[1:09:34] and the only way that naomi can get her
[1:09:36] estate back and all these things can
[1:09:38] happen
[1:09:39] you know is that boaz marries ruth and
[1:09:42] boaz just happens to see ruth in his
[1:09:44] field fall in love with her
[1:09:45] many many times you think things are
[1:09:47] just providential
[1:09:48] i just happen to be at the right place
[1:09:50] at the right time and hear the right
[1:09:51] thing i just yo it's just chance there's
[1:09:53] not chance
[1:09:54] it's predestinated moments in our lives
[1:09:56] that god ordains for us to hear the
[1:09:58] right word at the right time and our
[1:10:00] hearts are in the right condition
[1:10:02] hallelujah for us to receive it and then
[1:10:04] so here
[1:10:05] so then boaz marries ruth hallelujah
[1:10:09] and and in the process redeems naomi's
[1:10:12] lost estate
[1:10:13] and restores it back now it's exactly
[1:10:15] the same thing where where boaz the
[1:10:17] mighty man of wealth we know that is a
[1:10:19] type of christ
[1:10:21] and he marries a gentile in order to
[1:10:24] restore the jews back to their
[1:10:26] last possession so now the prophet tells
[1:10:29] us
[1:10:30] that that that that boaz marrying ruth
[1:10:33] is the same as the lamb taking the book
[1:10:37] hallelujah so it's exactly the same so
[1:10:40] what it is now
[1:10:40] is is the union so so it's not just the
[1:10:43] lord
[1:10:44] claiming a whole dispensation of people
[1:10:47] and revealing what's in them it's
[1:10:50] actually god taking you
[1:10:52] opening the mystery of your life
[1:10:55] hallelujah and revealing what's watson
[1:10:57] you now remember brother braham says
[1:11:00] that the
[1:11:01] opening of the seals reveals christ now
[1:11:04] where is christ to be revealed
[1:11:05] in you right not just in here this has
[1:11:09] got to live
[1:11:10] i mean this is just ink on paper without
[1:11:12] the spirit of god taken to a
[1:11:13] spirit-filled life and it manifesting a
[1:11:15] character
[1:11:16] hallelujah so it's actually it's
[1:11:18] actually when he takes the book it's
[1:11:19] symbolic of him claiming
[1:11:21] you back because no one was found worthy
[1:11:24] to redeem you back to where you should
[1:11:25] have been
[1:11:26] before the fall no man is worthy no
[1:11:28] prophet all the prophets were there the
[1:11:29] holy men great men of the ages were
[1:11:31] there
[1:11:32] i mean even joseph was standing there
[1:11:34] the only one thing held against him was
[1:11:36] one lie
[1:11:38] when his father came down to down to
[1:11:40] egypt he said yo before you tell pharaoh
[1:11:42] your occupation
[1:11:44] don't say you're a shepherd it's an
[1:11:45] abomination to the egyptians you know
[1:11:47] color it in a little bit you know give
[1:11:49] yourself a promotion but you know
[1:11:51] give it but but you know so that was the
[1:11:52] one mark against him his whole life
[1:11:54] because every man's got to fail
[1:11:57] so all the holy men were there all the
[1:11:58] prophets all the you know
[1:12:00] believers down through the ages but
[1:12:01] there was no man
[1:12:03] hallelujah but one and when john first
[1:12:07] looked he couldn't see him
[1:12:09] because he was he was interceding for
[1:12:11] the ages
[1:12:12] now now before i continue on with this
[1:12:15] he still is an intercessor
[1:12:17] because it's part of his character right
[1:12:20] he's still an intercessor because
[1:12:22] his blood you know people say well he's
[1:12:24] off the mercy seat now
[1:12:25] because he stepped off the throne to
[1:12:27] take the book well the scriptures tell
[1:12:29] us
[1:12:29] heaven is my throne this is in isaiah 66
[1:12:31] and 1
[1:12:32] thus saith the lord the heaven is my
[1:12:34] throne the earth is my
[1:12:36] footstool where is the house that you
[1:12:37] will build unto me and where is the
[1:12:39] place of my rest so
[1:12:40] he's still on his throne because he's in
[1:12:43] heaven his physical body is still in
[1:12:44] heaven
[1:12:45] right so he's still there making a
[1:12:47] decision for you and i
[1:12:49] that's not crazy is it no so people say
[1:12:51] and and then also the prophet tells us
[1:12:53] very simply
[1:12:54] you know when jesus was hanging on
[1:12:56] calvary he says the mercy seat was in
[1:12:58] plain beyond calvary
[1:13:01] so the mercy seat wasn't a piece of
[1:13:04] furniture
[1:13:05] it was a person which it always has been
[1:13:06] a person
[1:13:08] right so so now he is always a seat of
[1:13:10] mercy
[1:13:12] to those he gives mercy to remember the
[1:13:14] high priest went in with names over his
[1:13:16] heart
[1:13:17] to get mercy for them hallelujah
[1:13:20] with blood to get mercy for them it's
[1:13:22] the same thing with you and i
[1:13:23] i mean the scripture tells us that that
[1:13:25] that we are engraved in the palm of his
[1:13:27] hands
[1:13:28] let's find that scripture i have it
[1:13:29] somewhere i like these you know
[1:13:32] i like these kind of scriptures because
[1:13:33] it's telling me the lord says you know
[1:13:35] i can't leave thee nor forsake thee i
[1:13:38] can't forget you
[1:13:40] hallelujah isaiah 49
[1:13:43] 13 oh sing o heavens and be joyful o
[1:13:46] earth and break forth into singing o
[1:13:49] mountains
[1:13:49] for the lord hath comforted his people
[1:13:52] and will have mercy upon his afflicted
[1:13:55] but zion said now we're going to look at
[1:13:58] our
[1:13:58] what's our confession and what's god's
[1:14:01] confession
[1:14:02] our confession should match god's
[1:14:04] confession amen
[1:14:05] so the lord is saying sing
[1:14:08] be joyful break forth into singing
[1:14:12] for the lord's comforted confidence
[1:14:13] people and her and will have mercy upon
[1:14:15] his afflicted we get afflicted from time
[1:14:17] to time
[1:14:18] but then the next verse says but zion
[1:14:20] said so now zion's the bride this is her
[1:14:23] confession
[1:14:24] the lord hath forsaken me and the lord
[1:14:26] hath forgotten me
[1:14:28] but in the previous verse he's just said
[1:14:30] no i've comforted my people
[1:14:32] and i'll have mercy upon my i mean i
[1:14:34] mean he's afflicted
[1:14:36] but then the bride's saying no i'm
[1:14:37] forsaken hold on
[1:14:39] but then the lord says can a woman
[1:14:41] forget her suckling child
[1:14:43] sucking child that she should not have
[1:14:45] compassion on the son of her womb yea
[1:14:48] they may forget yet will i not forget
[1:14:51] thee
[1:14:52] behold i have graven thee upon the palm
[1:14:54] of my hands
[1:14:56] thy walls are continually before me
[1:14:59] so he said um you know i don't know how
[1:15:01] a mother could forget a child
[1:15:05] right all those who have given birth
[1:15:06] here i don't know how you could forget a
[1:15:08] child you've brought to the earth but he
[1:15:10] says they can forget but i can't forget
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:13] i've graven thee upon the palm of my
[1:15:15] hands
[1:15:17] and then he says in isaiah 49 o zion
[1:15:19] thou bringeth forth good tidings
[1:15:21] get thee up into the high mountain of
[1:15:23] jerusalem that bringeth forth good
[1:15:24] tidings lift up thy voice with strength
[1:15:27] lift it up be not afraid say unto the
[1:15:29] cities of judah
[1:15:30] behold your god behold the lord god will
[1:15:33] come with a strong hand
[1:15:34] and his arm shall rule for him behold
[1:15:37] his reward is with him and his work
[1:15:38] before him
[1:15:39] he shall feed his flock like a shepherd
[1:15:42] he shall gather the lambs with his arm
[1:15:45] and carry them in his bosom and shall
[1:15:47] gently lead those that are with young
[1:15:50] so the lord's telling us now he's going
[1:15:52] to carry us in his bosom he's going to
[1:15:54] hold us close
[1:15:56] hallelujah he says that he we are
[1:15:58] engraved in the palm of his hands
[1:16:02] so we're a part of him it's not just a
[1:16:06] you know a garment that he puts on with
[1:16:09] our names on our names are a part of him
[1:16:12] hallelujah now so
[1:16:16] he's he always is mercy because remember
[1:16:18] when he takes the book
[1:16:20] there's still the jews that have to be
[1:16:21] gathered as well
[1:16:23] right so the blood that he shed on
[1:16:26] calvary was for our atonement and for
[1:16:28] their atonement
[1:16:33] now we're where was i now
[1:16:37] so heaven in his heaven is his throne
[1:16:39] and earth is his footstool
[1:16:41] so that tells me that he can take the
[1:16:43] book
[1:16:45] but still be in heaven interceding
[1:16:48] right so and then he sent down
[1:16:52] the revelation of the contents of that
[1:16:54] book in revelations 10.
[1:16:57] amen an anointing came down from heaven
[1:16:59] with an open book
[1:17:00] to make us see who who we really are in
[1:17:02] christ
[1:17:03] every promise would come into
[1:17:05] manifestation in this hour
[1:17:09] amen so god's throne is not a chair it's
[1:17:11] a place
[1:17:12] heaven is my throne
[1:17:16] so there he is so so mercy only comes to
[1:17:18] an end
[1:17:19] for the gentiles when they did in christ
[1:17:21] race
[1:17:22] so right now there's still mercy
[1:17:24] hallelujah
[1:17:25] i need an intercessor every day of my
[1:17:27] life i need that blood every day
[1:17:30] amen but i won't need it when this
[1:17:32] body's changed
[1:17:34] right hallelujah but the jews still need
[1:17:37] it
[1:17:39] because there comes a time when those
[1:17:41] jews
[1:17:42] change their song
[1:17:46] in revelations 15 and 1 he says another
[1:17:48] um i saw another sign in heaven great
[1:17:50] and marvelous seven angels having the
[1:17:52] seven last plagues
[1:17:53] for in them has filled up the wrath of
[1:17:55] god and i saw as it were a sea of glass
[1:17:57] mingled with fire
[1:17:59] and then that had gotten the victory
[1:18:00] over the beast over his image over his
[1:18:02] mark over the number of his name
[1:18:04] stand on the sea of glass having harps
[1:18:06] of god and they sing the song of moses
[1:18:09] the servant of god
[1:18:10] and the song of the lamb now we don't
[1:18:13] sing the song of moses this is a jewish
[1:18:14] song
[1:18:15] i mean we you know you can see the song
[1:18:18] after the red sea
[1:18:20] where they when they look back and they
[1:18:21] see the enemy is drowned in the red sea
[1:18:23] and the anointing of god falls upon them
[1:18:24] moses and says the nice and he sang a
[1:18:26] song
[1:18:27] of victory hallelujah but they also sing
[1:18:30] the song of the lamb
[1:18:32] amen so these are the jews that have
[1:18:34] received the same christ we know
[1:18:38] hallelujah saying great and marvelous
[1:18:41] thy works lord god almighty true
[1:18:44] just and true thy ways thou king of
[1:18:46] saints who shall not fear thee o lord
[1:18:49] and magnify thy name for thou
[1:18:51] art for only for thou only art holy for
[1:18:54] all nations shall come and worship
[1:18:56] before thee
[1:18:56] for thy judgment is made manifest
[1:19:00] hallelujah now
[1:19:04] it's a time of trouble when the bride is
[1:19:06] gathered
[1:19:08] and raptured now we won't
[1:19:12] i see time has just ran away somewhere
[1:19:14] so so i don't want to keep you too long
[1:19:15] but
[1:19:16] you read psalms 27 maybe we'll just read
[1:19:18] it quickly i won't make
[1:19:20] many comments but brother brown when he
[1:19:22] preaches the rapture message he opens
[1:19:23] that sermon with psalms 27
[1:19:26] because he's saying this is the
[1:19:27] condition of the people that go on the
[1:19:29] rapture
[1:19:30] and this is the condition the earth will
[1:19:31] be and when the rapture takes place
[1:19:33] he says the lord is my light and my
[1:19:35] salvation whom shall i fear
[1:19:37] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:19:39] whom shall i be afraid i trust this is
[1:19:41] your testimony oh
[1:19:42] i'm now i'm now reading when the wicked
[1:19:44] even my enemies and my foes
[1:19:46] came up came upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:19:49] they stumbled and fell you know there
[1:19:50] came a time where
[1:19:51] the enemy came against you and you
[1:19:53] stumbled and fell but there's got to
[1:19:55] come a time where the holy ghost comes
[1:19:56] and overcoming power
[1:19:58] that same enemy comes against you but he
[1:20:00] stumbles and falls it's not you
[1:20:01] stumbling and falling
[1:20:03] hallelujah why because the holy ghost
[1:20:04] gives overcoming power there's nothing
[1:20:06] too difficult for him in a believer's
[1:20:08] life
[1:20:09] hallelujah amen though a host shouldn't
[1:20:12] camp against me
[1:20:14] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:20:16] rise against me and this will i be
[1:20:18] confident
[1:20:19] one thing i have desired of the lord
[1:20:21] that i will seek after
[1:20:22] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:20:24] lord all the days of my life
[1:20:26] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:20:27] inquire in his temple so what is the
[1:20:29] believer's heart after they receive the
[1:20:30] holy ghost lord i just want to be where
[1:20:32] you are
[1:20:33] i just want to praise you i just want to
[1:20:35] give you glory i just want to love you
[1:20:36] more and more
[1:20:37] that's the condition of the believer
[1:20:40] i mean for in the time of trouble he
[1:20:42] shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:20:44] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[1:20:46] he hide me he shall set me up upon a
[1:20:48] rock now
[1:20:49] why is it a secret because the devil
[1:20:51] doesn't know
[1:20:52] this place of being united you know the
[1:20:55] devil is really close to god
[1:20:57] up in heaven but he's not as close as
[1:21:00] the bride is with god
[1:21:01] because we're one the devil and god just
[1:21:03] had a working relationship
[1:21:06] but we have a union a love affair a
[1:21:08] marriage
[1:21:09] amen and he shall set me up upon a rock
[1:21:12] you know i think about sitting up upon a
[1:21:13] rock yeah you
[1:21:14] lift up one of your children you put
[1:21:15] them up on a on a on a on a table
[1:21:17] you set them up somewhere who does that
[1:21:19] yeah you set them up somewhere
[1:21:21] so so now they're up high looking down
[1:21:23] on everything their view has been lifted
[1:21:25] up
[1:21:25] they're once looking down here now
[1:21:27] they're up here looking down
[1:21:29] hallelujah now we've been lifted up
[1:21:31] we're on a rock revelation
[1:21:33] we can see from eternity to eternity we
[1:21:36] know who we are in christ we know who
[1:21:37] christ
[1:21:38] is amen we know who our god is we know
[1:21:40] his the power of his redemption
[1:21:42] we know also the devil's very limited
[1:21:44] power just being a bluff he's defeated
[1:21:46] amen and we know that he's going to a
[1:21:48] lag of fire we're going into glory
[1:21:50] hallelujah so never ever let the devil
[1:21:52] try and rob the fact that you know who
[1:21:54] you are
[1:21:56] the devil doesn't believe who you are he
[1:21:58] went to the lord himself if they'll be
[1:22:00] if they'll be the son of god you know if
[1:22:01] he wasn't sure and if he really was sure
[1:22:04] he would never have let the
[1:22:05] crucifixion take place but he wasn't
[1:22:08] sure
[1:22:09] if you're really the son of god come off
[1:22:10] the cross and we'll believe you that was
[1:22:12] the devil anointing them saying
[1:22:13] if you really are do this and we'll go
[1:22:15] prove it this way
[1:22:16] prove it how i want you to prove it and
[1:22:18] then i'll believe it don't people do it
[1:22:19] the same way
[1:22:20] if this message really is true then it's
[1:22:22] going to be xyz then i'll believe it
[1:22:24] hold on
[1:22:25] it's revelation not not not a mental
[1:22:27] understanding it was a mental
[1:22:29] understanding the scribes and pharisees
[1:22:30] would have been in the upper room but
[1:22:31] they weren't
[1:22:33] amen so and then and now shall my head
[1:22:37] be lifted up above
[1:22:38] mine enemies round about me therefore
[1:22:40] will i offer in his tabernacle
[1:22:42] sacrifices of joy
[1:22:44] i will sing i'll sing praises unto the
[1:22:46] lord hear
[1:22:47] o lord when i cry with my voice have
[1:22:49] mercy also upon me and answer me we're
[1:22:52] now said to seek ye my
[1:22:53] face my heart said unto thee thy face
[1:22:56] lord will i seek this so in the god you
[1:22:59] know when the lord speaks to do
[1:23:00] something it's actually your heart
[1:23:01] responding
[1:23:02] it's a deep calling to it deep calling
[1:23:05] to a deep
[1:23:06] harlot this is the condition of a
[1:23:07] believer amen
[1:23:10] during the time of the rapture he says
[1:23:12] now it'll be
[1:23:14] in a time of trouble and and that's why
[1:23:16] i went to joseph's
[1:23:17] time there because it was a time of
[1:23:19] great famine great trouble in the world
[1:23:22] when he when he gathers his bride takes
[1:23:24] a rapture then reveals himself to the
[1:23:25] jews just exactly like today
[1:23:27] i mean this did there is trouble on
[1:23:29] every hand but we are not in that
[1:23:31] trouble
[1:23:32] hallelujah now
[1:23:35] brother abraham and the rapture message
[1:23:36] as well he would
[1:23:38] he would go into speaking of the
[1:23:41] resurrection of lazarus
[1:23:43] and he would say that the resurrection
[1:23:44] of lazarus types the gathering of the
[1:23:46] living bride to bring the dead in christ
[1:23:49] from the grave
[1:23:50] now i'll just touch on this very briefly
[1:23:54] but mary and martha weren't
[1:23:57] dancing skipping and jumping having a
[1:23:59] wonderful time when jesus was coming to
[1:24:01] their house to gather the living bride
[1:24:02] together
[1:24:03] their brother had just died people had
[1:24:06] come to comfort them and obviously
[1:24:08] they're just pouring a whole bunch of
[1:24:09] unbelief
[1:24:10] if he really was your buddy he would
[1:24:12] have been here
[1:24:13] why did he go somewhere else didn't you
[1:24:14] send word i'm so sorry he died but but
[1:24:17] but then you send word and
[1:24:18] you know but he said i'm going to go
[1:24:20] this way why'd he come here if he really
[1:24:21] had all power he would have come
[1:24:23] if he really was the messiah oh this
[1:24:25] must been a too hard basket i think
[1:24:26] you've caught up in a cult
[1:24:28] i think you've gone been been influenced
[1:24:30] the wrong way and you know this is
[1:24:32] obviously the fruit of what you believe
[1:24:34] he won't come and do it
[1:24:35] but remember the lord has a purpose for
[1:24:37] everything if we just stand still you
[1:24:39] see the salvation of the lord
[1:24:41] uh leah so so jesus is never late
[1:24:44] we we think many times he's late but
[1:24:46] he's right on time
[1:24:48] hallelujah so now here is here is mary
[1:24:50] and martha
[1:24:51] and then jesus it says in john 11 17
[1:24:54] then when jesus came he found that they
[1:24:56] had later
[1:24:57] he had laid in the gray grave four days
[1:25:00] already
[1:25:01] now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem
[1:25:03] about 15 furlongs off
[1:25:05] and many of the jews came to mary and
[1:25:07] martha to comfort them concerning their
[1:25:08] brother
[1:25:10] then martha as soon as she heard that
[1:25:11] jesus was coming went and met him
[1:25:14] but mary sat still in the house you know
[1:25:17] some people go
[1:25:18] quick some people take a while but as
[1:25:20] long as you get there because if you're
[1:25:22] being gathered
[1:25:23] if your name is over his heart you're to
[1:25:25] come
[1:25:26] hallelujah so they are both under the
[1:25:28] sadness and brokenness of losing their
[1:25:30] brother
[1:25:30] but one left the sadness of their past
[1:25:33] and went to him
[1:25:34] the other one was still there but jesus
[1:25:36] was not going to go raise the dead
[1:25:38] saints till they were all gathered
[1:25:40] the dead in christ aren't going to rise
[1:25:41] until all the living have come into
[1:25:43] christ
[1:25:43] i mean that are on the lamb's book of
[1:25:45] life hallelujah
[1:25:47] then when martha said unto jesus lord if
[1:25:49] thou
[1:25:50] had has been here my brother had not
[1:25:52] died but i know i know
[1:25:53] but i know that even now whatever thou
[1:25:55] ask of god god will give it thee
[1:25:57] jesus sat unto her thy brother shall
[1:25:59] rise again martha said saith unto him i
[1:26:02] know that he shall rise again in the
[1:26:04] resurrection at the last day
[1:26:06] but the lord doesn't want us to look at
[1:26:07] a promise in the future he wants it
[1:26:09] present
[1:26:09] and jesus said unto her i am the
[1:26:12] resurrection and the life
[1:26:13] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:26:15] dead yet shall he live so he says i am
[1:26:17] the resurrection present tense right now
[1:26:19] and the life present tense
[1:26:20] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:26:22] shall never die believeth thou this
[1:26:24] and a believer says yay lord she said it
[1:26:27] she that
[1:26:28] she saith unto him yay lord i believe
[1:26:31] that thou art the christ the son of god
[1:26:33] which should come into the world and
[1:26:35] when she had so
[1:26:36] said she went away and called
[1:26:39] mary her sister secretly
[1:26:43] saying the master come and calleth for
[1:26:46] thee
[1:26:46] that's why we have a ministry we're
[1:26:49] going to find the mary's of this world
[1:26:51] the master's come he's descended
[1:26:54] his spirit is upon the earth he's a
[1:26:56] sinner with a shout
[1:26:57] amen hallelujah now we're going to find
[1:26:59] the mary's and say the master's here
[1:27:02] physically you say well is he come or is
[1:27:04] he coming well his spirit's here
[1:27:07] but he's still coming because we'll meet
[1:27:08] him in the air right that body brother
[1:27:10] ram says
[1:27:11] those sacred feet will not touch the
[1:27:13] earth when the bride goes
[1:27:16] because we'll meet him in the air
[1:27:18] hallelujah but so in a way he's come but
[1:27:19] he's coming
[1:27:21] so so it's our commission to find the
[1:27:24] mary's who are still stuck in
[1:27:26] the disappointment of power your
[1:27:27] religious disappointment of the past
[1:27:30] call them to come to where jesus is
[1:27:32] which is the word for this
[1:27:34] hour as soon as she heard that
[1:27:37] she arose quickly and came unto him
[1:27:41] hallelujah what to do the now now the
[1:27:44] living bride was gathered
[1:27:46] for the dead in christ to come forth out
[1:27:48] of the grave brother abraham says in the
[1:27:49] rapture message
[1:27:50] and and i'll just finish with this now
[1:27:52] it's the first thing is the sounding the
[1:27:54] first thing is a uh
[1:27:56] a shout then a voice and then a trumpet
[1:27:59] now he's speaking at first thessalonians
[1:28:00] 4
[1:28:01] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:28:03] ready the second is a voice of the
[1:28:05] resurrection the same voice
[1:28:07] a loud voice in saint john 11 38-44 that
[1:28:10] called lazarus from the grave
[1:28:12] getting the bride together and then the
[1:28:14] resurrection of the dead sea to be
[1:28:16] caught up with it
[1:28:17] now watch the three things take place
[1:28:19] and what is next uh of
[1:28:21] a shout a voice a trumpet now the third
[1:28:24] thing is a trumpet which always as the
[1:28:25] feast of trumpets is calling the people
[1:28:27] to the feast
[1:28:28] and that'll be the bride supper the lamb
[1:28:31] supper with the bride
[1:28:32] in the sky see so the first thing comes
[1:28:35] forth
[1:28:36] uh is his message calling the bride
[1:28:38] together the next thing is a
[1:28:39] resurrection of the sleeping
[1:28:41] bride the ones who died back in other
[1:28:42] ages they're caught together and the
[1:28:44] trumpet
[1:28:45] the feast and the heavens and the sky
[1:28:47] why that's the thing
[1:28:49] that takes place friends
[1:28:52] hallelujah so we're living in this
[1:28:54] moment
[1:28:55] of a time of trouble amen
[1:28:59] but we've been gathered hallelujah
[1:29:03] see he is still interceding for us in
[1:29:05] the heavens
[1:29:06] we still have a high priest
[1:29:09] but once every name that's on his book
[1:29:12] that's over his heart
[1:29:13] he says dipped in blood redeemed yes
[1:29:16] then we're going to meet him in the air
[1:29:20] hallelujah amen aren't you glad
[1:29:24] i just finished with that aren't you
[1:29:25] glad now that when he
[1:29:28] went to calvary when he ascended up high
[1:29:30] after that we're over his heart
[1:29:33] hallelujah that he wasn't just going
[1:29:35] through some kind of business
[1:29:37] transaction of

[1:29:52] now he's there making intercession his
[1:29:54] spirits upon the earth to gather us
