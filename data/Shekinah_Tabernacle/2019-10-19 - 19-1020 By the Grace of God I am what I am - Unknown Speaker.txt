yeah so we're having lunch next door afterwards everyone's welcome and also the toilets are in the back if you need to use the bathroom during service amen so let's go to the book of 1st Corinthians we're going to read one just one verse from first Corinthians chapter 15 I'm going to read first Corinthians 15 and verse 10 then we yes we're gonna read here this is here and then we're gonna go to Zechariah for it so the Apostle Paul says but by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of God which was with me I mean let's go to the book of Zechariah and chapter 4 and we're gonna read verses so so Zechariah 4 and verses 6 and 7 he says then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel thou shall become a plain he shall bring forth the headstone we're off with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zarubin have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you I mean let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we want to thank you we can bless the Lord O our souls all this within us can bless your Holy Name dear God we want to thank you we can come and open your word this morning and but we're very aware Lord anyone who can read can read your word but it takes you the author to come and make it live - to reveal it to our heart so I pray dear God that father may your spirit be upon every soul this morning Lord anoint not just speaker but here as well and my father has always Lord we want to just surrender the service into your hands Lord we are not our own we're bought with a price the price of the pleasure precious blood of Jesus Christ a lot the service went on our own where the service is not ours Lord it's your service so may just step in take control Father for your glory meet every need I ask father may you heal every sick one here dear God be those who couldn't make it today as well be their portion and Lord just may you receive all honor glory and praise Lord this morning in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning I want to I want to speak if I could if I could if I could take a title this morning I'd like to take the Apostle Paul's words here where he's speaking in first Corinthians 15 we read but by the grace of God I am what I am now grace is the grace of God I believe is a very misunderstood thing today and people make it all kinds of things yours brother Brown would say in the message of grace he says and the message of grace has been trampled under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into everything but the true message of grace remains the same and that and there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God we're all safe by and even as Jude would say in Jude 3 and for esa's beloved I give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now though I think I see twas the New Living Translation sees it like this I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches saying that God's marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives the condemnation of such people was recorded long ago for they have denied our only master and Lord Jesus Christ so if Jude could write to the church just surely after you know the day of Pentecost and he was he was exhorting him to earnestly contend for the faith because some of krypton unawares have turned the grace of God into lasciviousness how much more 2,000 years down the road I mean shall we contend for the message of grace I mean the Apostle Paul when he said but that by by the grace of God I am what I am he was declaring that the grace of God made him something it wasn't just a word he said which you know it's the grace of God like some eerie fairy thing but he was saying that he was a product of God's grace so God's grace molded him shaped them changed him transformed him from what he was and to what he became so we know the you know you know the Apostle Paul he was Saul he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he is a very religious man he fought against what God was doing in his day he you know you know he was you know he was organizationally minded he he didn't know what God was doing he only knew of a god of history he only read the scrolls and you what God did but he didn't know what did God was doing and then to that one he was but when God's grace came to him had changed him from that and to and to the Apostle to the Gentiles for the first church age messenger it transformed him from what he was to what he became so so the grace of God actually is a force it's a power I mean it's not just a nice word I'm saved by the grace of God know if you're saved by the grace of God it will manifest in your life and in your life that you live it won't be you trying to do it I mean he his Spirit will come into you and he will be the Christian in you holy it's not us trying to be Christians it's him in us being the Christian other that's how we really are Christians amen so so there's a power there's a force amen of the grace of God that transforms people and even in the New Testament you know if you go look at the UM you know you know the meaning of words you know the word grace in the New Testament it says this word it means a graciousness and it means a it means especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life so this is what grace means it's a it's the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life source of force I mean it comes into the believer there's an influence that comes on the heart of the believer and it's reflected in the life so and even the word influence if you go back to from the old French in English in the Latin that it comes from and means something to flow in so something flows into you hallelujah and if something flows them is a force behind it pushing it in Pylea so now if we have come under a divine influence if we have felt the grace of God come around our lives God's flown in he's pushed himself as a force come in and it has being is coming to you holy has transformed your life that's the grace of God amen you look at you look at for example you know when when God was creating his creation the apex of that creation was man amen and then when he formed Adam out of the dust of the earth I said that God breathed into him and and he became a living soul there's a force there's a breath went into him amen and then when Abraham we know Abraham was called by grace brother Bram see that Abraham was just an ordinary man but God by election Sovereign Grace called Abraham when there's many young men in the land that day that was probably more capable of doing the job as the world would think that Abraham was but God knows the heart that's it so Abraham was just an ordinary man but God called him that's what made him special and that's what makes the believer special we're just like anyone but God called you oh there got elected you hallelujah God's sovereign grace found you amen so Abraham his name was changed and and Sarah Sarah I was changed to Sarah and Abraham to Abraham and in the Hebrew that would the H that goes their name that speaks of the breath of God God breathed into them I say they came under a divine influence I mean grace came upon them God breathed in the he breathed into Adam became a living soul he breathed into Abraham and Sarah you're gonna have the promised son it's not going to be your own flesh that's gonna bring forth this child I'm going to cause you to bring forth the child hallelujah amen show he breathed into them and then now when you come down to Jesus before he ascends it says and he breathed on his disciples saying receive ye the Holy Ghost cease now he's breathing into them and we know that here ooo they received that breath on the day of Pentecost so God was his life was going into them they were they were receiving the grace of God by his life going into them hallelujah amen and we know that the Apostle Paul would say that we are new creations I mean those that have the Holy Ghost are not a patched up creation I mean Christianity is not Reformation it's not a self-help guide to becoming a better person that's a transforming power that comes in by His Word and changes you from what you were to what you should be according to his word hallelujah that's real Christian anywhere you know what you once were you're not that person no more and it's not you trying to change yourself God comes and changes you God transforms you by his word hallelujah by his Spirit hallelujah so they came under a divine Abraham came under a divine influence hallelujah now if we read let's go to Roman's 4 shall we we're just going to read a bit here I'm glad for the grace of God I'm glad for us grace hallelujah now romans 4 and onee of the apostle paul picks up Abraham's life he says what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham was justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before gods if so he's saying basically I did it all you know if Abraham said I did it all you know he he can glory in himself but not in God for what saith the scripture aver abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt so to him that workers do it and their own ability that they what they're saying it's not the divine influence of God upon my heart and it's reflection of life that's doing it grace but it's my own ability amen so to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt and he that receiveth of circumcision of the seal of the righteousness of faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believed though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them and the father of circumcision now so I've dropped from verse four you know and they'll just read eleven there in 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so the Apostle Paul is saying that Abraham's life is a pattern for the believer right that they that we are walking in after we're walking in the steps of that faith I mean so so Abraham was just like ordinary man but then God called him the grace of God came down into his life because God had a specific purpose for his life I mean God just didn't call Abraham for the sake of it but God was going to through Abraham would bring Isaac then Jacob then the patriarchs and ultimately Christ would come see he had a purpose and calling Abraham and he has a purpose in calling you he has a purpose and His grace influencing your life and her manifesting that grace out of your life I mean and that is not just to be a religious person now that's the manifester word for your day hallelujah that this Bible would put on flesh I mean it's not just this that's no good just having the scripture just here it's going to live hallelujah that the word must put on flesh that when people see you they should see the Bible living amen we are the word manifested are we not hallelujah amen for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to a see through the law but through the righteousness of faith for a fait which are of the lobby is faith is void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for we're no laura's there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise made to be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as is written I have made the father of many nations before whom he had believed even God who quickeneth and calleth those things which are not as though they were so therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace a divine influence hallelujah amen so Abraham was called he followed God amen and God called him God changed him God changed Sarah he breathed into them his life went unto them that they could fulfill what they were allotted to do in that day and it's the same thing with you and I friends without the grace of God not just saying you're under grace but at manifesting in you without that grace amen we're just fighting the air but I'm so glad as I read in Zechariah it says when the headstone comes down to be shoutings grace grace unto it now we know that that wasn't just speaking of the natural temple being rebuilt there in near myers day but there was a prophecy that that zerubabbel was a was actually a shadow of jesus christ saying that he would build he would lay the foundation of the church and then he would bring every every predestinate believer into that church and then the headstone would descend upon it and because because it says and Peter that we are lively stones of living stones built up into the temple of God I mean so saying now when the headstone comes down there will be manifest manifold grace grace grace oh yes sir so when the Lord comes and caps off your life I mean because we know that capstone is Christ what can the believer say grace grace father it's grace grace that God would unite himself with man how it's it's God's grace that he would wash us in his blood cleanses take away all sin all filthiness all perversion and we would become the living dwelling place of the Living God hallelujah speaking of this hour amen that grace is manifested in a you know grace is greater Grace's never been so greater than this day God's divine influence upon people holier to live above this world I mean to live in this world but not of this world it's not our it's not us keeping you you know you don't keep yourself in this world it's His grace keeps you in this world Alleluia amen now the first the first time grace is mentioned in the scripture it says in Genesis six and eight but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord hallelujah as it was in the days of Noah Schultz shows help me when the son of men reveal there'll be a people on the earth of finding the grace of God hallelujah but this word grace is not the same as the definition I gave you before but it just means graciousness kindness or favor it doesn't speak of the divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection in the life that's because in the Old Testament they were just under the blood of bulls and goats and we know the blood of bulls and goats can never change the heart of someone you know if we went back into the Old Testament day I was a worshipper and I I I had fallen and sinned in some way and but God's Word said you got to bring a lamb or a go to wherever it may be I would bring my lamb to the priest because I know I've done something wrong the beautiful thing is when I bring the lamb it's not me that's examined the priest doesn't examine the worshiper he he examines the lamb that's God's grace hallelujah I mean that that you don't sit in the interrogation seat I mean but God has to examine the lamb and once the lamb has been found without blemish then the lamb is offered on behalf of the worshiper and that worshipper can go away feeling justified because God has accepted his lamb hallelujah we have a perfect lamb our lamb was examined Pilate said I find no fault of him wholly and because he was accepted we're accepted I meant so so God doesn't examine you he examines the lamb and if you come according to that lamb you'll receive forgiveness of sins hallelujah but the thing is though I offer my lamb I'm justified now I'm back in the Old Testament because that was the blood of an animal it can't change my nature so the very fallen nature I was born with that caused me to sit in the first place I'd go away with it and that's why there was a continuous cycle of giving of offerings giving of offering so it never changed the heart of the believer though they were sincere though they believed it was God's requirement it could never change them that's why it's just that's just why I'd say a kindness or a favor kind of a grace and you know it's wonderful it's wonderful to be forgiven but it's more wonderful when God changes your nature that you cannot fall in what you fell in hallelujah amen see God changes God changes our desires I mean we don't have to train ourselves to abstain from things God just changed our desires that we just don't on it I mean I used to be a nice to be a homebrew making partying University student hallelujah but I'm not that anymore hallelujah Amen it so I could live in a brewery now and I'd still be sober because there's no desire in me that once it there's just nothing in me I don't have to keep my I don't have to hide away in some monastery someplace to overcome no God changes your nature by His grace amen anything you just overcoming hallelujah I'm glad for the grace of God amen so so it's kind of like a man who who you know someone who falls in a great debt and then they can't pay it but in someone who's very wealthy says I'll pay your debt for you and that's like under the Old Testament but they but the same nature that caused them to fall and debt in the first place they still carry it with them I mean but what they what that person would need is the nature of the wealthy man to come into them I mean that they wouldn't fall into debt again it's the same thing with us in the Lord I mean God's grace is going to fall on us I mean that he changes our nature that we don't go back into what we were I mean but we become his word hallelujah we become like him amen so now that was under the blood of bulls and goats who could never lift the believer into really the fullness of the grace of God amen but I'm glad we don't live in that day I'm glad we don't live back there hallelujah see the blood of Jesus Christ amen when you really when you really lay your hands by faith upon he's our lamb he's the perfect lamb and when you by faith lay your hands upon that land and you recognize that his life was for you amen remember the blood of a natural lamb could never the life there and that lamb could never change the nature of the worshiper because it was the animal life but here was the blood of God shed upon the earth hallelujah and that life I mean that life came out of him at Calvary and it was released to the world that whosoever would believe in him receivers word that same life that was in him with coming to you amen and change you hallelujah so now because the Lambs nature could never come into the worship in the Old Testament but the nature of our lamb can come into the believer amen and that's the grace of God hallelujah amen his nature comes into you by the Holy Ghost just like the Paul would say in first Corinthians six and nine he says know you not that the right that the unrighteousness I mean the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers neither nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God but this is but such were some of you I mean but ye are washed I mean yes sanctified yea justified in the name of Jesus Christ by the spirit about God so the Apostle Paul is saying you're once like that and you could never inherit the kingdom of God in that state Amen such as some such were some of you but you've been sanctified the grace of God has fallen upon you hallelujah once that way but you're not that way no more way because the grace of God hallelujah amen divine influence of His Holy Spirit fell upon you and changed your nature to be - to match his nature aim is his in second Corinthians five and 21 for he have made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we would be might be made the righteousness of God in him hallelujah so when the grace of God falls upon you I mean you can say I'm as righteous as God as righteous I'm as sinless he is sinless because of his blood I'm as holy as God as holy hallelujah amen now but it was prophesied in the Old Testament of the grace that we have received would come to the people let's go to Ezekiel 36 shall we amen is he killed 36 and and we're gonna read from verse 24 he says for I will take you from among the heathen and get you out of all countries and shall bring you into your own land now a land as a as an identity amen there's an identity I'm identified in New Zealand because I'm a New Zealand er this is my letters my natural land but to the believer we have no land on this earth I mean but our land is the Word of God our identity is in him amen we were born here sure we came out of many different nations but ultimately I mean our identity is in the Lord Jesus Christ so we're being called now this is a prophecy of the grace of God coming to us but he's saying now that we shall be um he shall call us out of I'm from among the heathen and get you and I'll bring you to your own land so I'll take you from from among the world and I'll bring you to the Word of God I'll bring you to your inheritance I'll bring you to your identity I mean though your rightful position I'll bring you to now you can be living in the same house you can be living in the same place your forebears lived but when the grace of God grips you you may be still living in the same house but you've gone to a new land because now you're identified in the Word of God so I'm not talking about changing countries I'm talking about changing I mean bring your identity being in this world to being in the Word of God amen hallelujah and then now it says I'll bring into your and then then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your idols will I cleanse you now you know we could read in the book of Ephesians where it says about we are washed by the water of the word hallelujah so he says I'll spray I'm gonna wash the world from you I'm gonna take your idols from either things you held in such high regard I mean you can have a lot of idols even in your heart you don't have to have them in your house they can be in here Amy says I'm gonna take I'm gonna wash those from you I'm gonna cleanse you hallelujah notice this is God notice every time we read through this is his I will I will I will never cease you will says I will it's the grace of God divine influence coming upon the amen and you had also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh amen so I will I will take the stony heart out of your flesh here you'll even agree the word is true amen I'll give you a new heart because you can't even get along with yourself I'm gonna do a work this is what he's saying hallelujah and I will but notice that's not the end of it because God can do great works in the life but you've got to come to a place where God seals you into the kingdom I mean so you don't just go from Sunday or Wednesday and Sunday I mean but God transforms you permanently seals you into the kingdom that every day you are victorious amen and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them why because he said I'm going to put my spirit in you amen in my spirit within you is going to cause you hallelujah amen - - to walk in my statutes you shall do my job you shall keep my judgments and do them so for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit I mean God said by my spirit and you you're gonna keep my word you're not going to keep it in your own humanity my spirit in you is going to keep it hallelujah amen what is that a prophecy of the grace that has come to us hallelujah I'm glad we have beneficiaries of that grace I believe we see that grace big manifested everyday holily I believe we're not just talking about a concept but it's a reality I mean the god of grace is a reality it's something that happens to you or something that changes you hallelujah amen now let's go to let's go to John and one I mean I mean I mean John chapter 1 and we'll read from verse 11 I mean aren't you glad for the grace of God I mean we should be the most happy people in all the world I mean that we didn't find God God found you I mean in the Garden of Eden God God went hunting Adam and Eve Adam where are you it wasn't Adam chasing God God was chasing Adam I mean he's been chasing Adams fallen race all the way down through the ages hallelujah grace God's grace that found you hallelujah amen he says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth John bear witness unto Him and cried saying this is this was he of whom I speak that he cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and others fullness have we all received and grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ hallelujah so the law we know just put us in jail but grace got us out of jail wholly hang and and the grace of God changes our nature that we can't get back in jail no more hallelujah so when but I want you to notice if we if we just turned to Matthew 5 and you know I trust you don't mind the reading but here was here was the Lord we know that Jesus you know he was God Jesus Christ was Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus Christ our than you so when God came down because his in Hebrews 11 that Moses followed Christ out of Egypt hallelujah and he was the messenger of the Covenant that came suddenly to his temple according to Malachi 3 and so now here so G so God came down to Mount Sinai and he gave the law but now in Matthew 5 he magnifies the law amen now I didn't expect a hallelujah but you know but I want you to show you know I want to show you God's grace is greater than the law it's always greater hallelujah so if we go to Matthew 5 and 17 he says think not I have come to destroy the law or the prophets I I am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled ye have heard that it was said by the eminent of old time thou shalt not kill and whose ever shall kill shall be in the danger of the judgment but I saying to you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to us brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hellfire now we just drop down to verse 27 just to save time ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her in his heart already in his heart so he magnified the law hallelujah Bick why because he was the fullness of grace and truth and he was telling those people hallelujah without my grace you're condemned doesn't matter how religious you are don't matter how good person you are without the grace of God coming you're done they meant so he magnified the Lord's because he was the fullness of grace and truth so the group grace of God is always greater than what the law can be Alou you know the Apostle so he magnified the law and it's because the god of grace was released upon the people now when you read through the epistles they always speak of may the grace of God be upon the people and even even even in in 2nd Peter verse 2 of chapter 1 Peter says grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our Lord and of Jesus our Lord so he's saying that so so he's he's desiring that the grace of God would be multiplied to them so it would get greater amen and and I'm so glad that it has been multiplied anybody see it's been multiplied through the knowledge of God so when God opens his word to you it should increase the amount of grace of of himself in your life I mean when he reveals himself when when he drops revelation into your heart of his word it should create a greater divine influence in your life hallelujah amen as you mature and grow in the Word of God what happens there's a greater influence as you see God sent you know continuing to sanctify you and change you and you overcome things what's happening that the his divine influence is becoming greater hallelujah now God's grace coming to us does not is not based on our present condition they meant he is the fountain of grace when he came to Lazarus Lazarus was dead for days he was in a bad state of being amen he was called he was you know they asked him to come Lazarus is sick but you know Jesus went another way and we know that Jesus is never late but but Lazarus coming out of the grave was completely outside his own ability right he couldn't resurrect himself there his body was in the grave for days the nose had fallen on his danger right away there was a state hallelujah but then now here comes the fountain of grace came down by the tomb Amen in their Mary and Martha said Lord if you've just been here amen our brother would not have died and then and then Jesus asked him you know do you believe he can raise again and they say yay Lord he will raise in the last day you know and many people put the promise of God off in the future but then he said no I am the resurrection the life so he's saying no it's not in the future I the resurrection and the life was present and God always wants us to bring the promise into the prison of his word it's got in the past it's now holy if we believe we're two-three gathered in my name he's in the myths then he is present I mean when the Word says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that means everything he was he will been everything is right now he will be in the future I mean he is the present God I mean so so so Jesus was trying to bring Mary Martha no no no not in the future now so here comes the grace of God here was here was Lazarus in the tomb rotting away hallelujah because it was totally outside his ability to race now it's the same thing with us the scripture says in Asians that you have quickened who was dead in trespasses and sins I mean so once upon a time we were literally though alive in these bodies dead in trespasses and sins amen that's how we were we could be religious we could believe we could be Christians remember until that quickening life comes into you and when we're dead in trespasses and sins and it's his Lazarus in this state you could say rotting away but in the resurrection the life comes to him it says where have you laid him why grace is going to come a divine influence is going to be breathed hallelujah so so he says now roll away the stone and he cries out Lazarus come forth and head brother Bram said if he didn't say Lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection hallelujah so so somebody who is dead in trespasses as they were dead they couldn't they're God's grace they couldn't ask you it was God's ability that raised him he spoke him Lazarus come forth and someone who was dead for days came into their body hallelujah the body wasn't rot no more and he stepped out of the tomb hallelujah way God's grace came his way amen and we were once in a tomb you know the devil the devil doesn't mind if we come to church the devil doesn't even mind if we read the Bible the devil doesn't even mind if we really pray but when the life of God comes into you I mean that's the thing the devil hates palea there was no persecution of the Church of the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost came down I mean but when Peter James it was a Peter and John we're going by the gate beautiful and there was that crippled man and they said silver and gold have my number such as I have gone to thee and they lifted him up and that crippled places will heal they left and jumped and praise the Lord that's when persecution began to come because the life of God was being manifested through our body probably the divine influence is coming but now it's being reflected hallelujah and that's when the persecution came so the devil doesn't mind if we just sit in church the devil doesn't mind if we just religious but it's when God's Word becomes manifested in our lives that's when the devil says now I've got trouble I've got to do something about these people I mean so the devil let you sit in a tomb of religion he'll set you loose in the tomb of culture amen he'll let you memorize this Bible but it's when the life of the wood comes into you that's when that's when the devil starts fighting hallelujah amen we need friends how God's alive I don't know about you but I'm a recipient of His grace Holly I was once in a tomb of this world and I didn't know how to get out I was wrapped up and all kinds of unbelief and and and pleasures of the world I was stuck in a tomb but one day I heard a voice one day I heard a supernatural voice I mean it wasn't a preacher's voice it wasn't the Oh it was God's voice I mean with God stepped out of history Holly it wasn't a God of our 2,000 years ago we did this and he's going to do something in the future no he stepped out of history to me hallelujah peace and he could be my name what happened God's grace came down Hollywood thing is you've gotta you're gonna receive it I mean you can't just say well you know you've got to give yourself to it hallelujah because when you give yourself to it then he can work on you hallelujah he says and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where an entire space you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience this is a Ephesians to I trust when I'm reading this you say he's he's he's reading my testimony hallelujah among whom also we all had conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who's Richard mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with Christ he says by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages had me to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace yes through faith that is not as yourselves it's a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them hallelujah see same by grace by divine influence ye are saved I mean through faith so it's God's divine influence I trust you know you really think about it has God's grace really fallen upon you or are you just going with the crowd I mean are you just going with the crowd or as God got ahold of you himself I mean where if you didn't have a church you didn't have a Bible you didn't have known to fellowship with you still would be a believer I mean you'd be like Daniel hallelujah who didn't have a church the girder didn't have fellowship but yet and Babylon he was stood he didn't fear the Kings commandment hallelujah he didn't bend what what the world was doing he says now I'm gonna worship my God hallelujah do you have that kind of grace in your life where if mummy or daddy said they don't no longer believe you'd say I still believe because he's become real to me hallelujah has that has that grace come to you and I and I'm just going to finish with that question because if it if it hasn't it's available it's available but you've got to call upon him I mean we don't just become Christians because mummy and daddy are Christians you've got to meet him yourself you've got to have your own personal meeting with Jesus Christ you've got to meet him and this word has become alive to you hallelujah so I want to ask you the question do you know grace do you know the grace of God because it will keep you in the bad times not just in the good and the hard times that grace will keep you that divine influence is I'm not letting you go I purchase your salvation now I want to see their salvation manifested in your life hallelujah I'm not gonna let you go you're my child gonna heal yourself a lord minute better than what's coming to me slow through me Oh God hallelujah do you know grace I trust you could say yes but if you don't I would talk to him right now and say Lord show me this grace that's been spoken about I don't want a secondhand religion or a secondhand Christian walk I want to know you my I just have with yoyoyo before I met the Lord I thought well if he said he's alive and you can meet him I want to meet him that was just me I was just simple and and I still feel the same way if he's alive and he is you can meet him hallelujah this bow hitch shall we and quiver the musicians to to come forward please that's want to ask
