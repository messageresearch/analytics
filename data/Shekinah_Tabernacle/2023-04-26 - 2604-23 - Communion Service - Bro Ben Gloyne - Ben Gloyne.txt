12 tonight I mean but our Lord is faithful and true amen praise the Lord amen aren't you glad we can be gathered here tonight and amen so we're going to go to Exodus chapter 12 I'm going to read from verse uh we're just going to read from verse one amen we're gonna then we're going to read down to um we're going to read down to verse 13. and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak here unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth month of this day they shall take uh to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb friend house and if the house I'll be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to us eating shall ye uh make your account for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole congregation a whole assembly of the congregation sorry of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two doorposts and and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall they shall eat it eat it not uh eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast it with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I'll pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smile the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast again and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I'll pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen let's just bow heads in the word of prayer tonight amen as we approach the Lord's table amen gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can gather together this night Lord in your divine presence Lord we just want to ask Lord you would cover us in your blood Lord may he forgive us of all of our sins and our trespasses and Lord as we approach your table tonight Lord to take the Lord's Supper as we call it Lord I I pray God may you be very near Lord Jesus may this be a sacred moment for us we lord we don't take it Lord out of tradition Lord but out of love and Thanksgiving for what you've done for us today God has we've read your word now we need you the great author Lord may you come and anoint it Lord to speaker and hear O Lord may you touch each life here Lord whether it be in body if they're sick Lord May heal them Lord or in spirit Lord Jesus Lord may he meet every need Lord according to your riches and Glory we love you Lord and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats tonight I'm not going to be long because we want to get through foot washing as well tonight but I just want to draw your attention here we have uh you could say you know this is the Passover we just read about and we and we see it's uh a shadow of the communion you know of the Lord's table where where the blood had to be applied where the you know the lamb uh had to be slain the blood had to be applied but I just want you to notice this that you know this this this night where it was going to be the last night you know when this happens when the last night they're going to be in Egypt then God was going to take them into another land and they had to be dressed to go I mean they weren't they weren't just lounging around but they were dressed and ready to leave where where we read there in um verse 11 and thus shall he eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's passovers they were dressed to leave amen and I believe as the Bride of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we are dressed to leave this world Amen because that's why we take the communion because remember our Christian journey is not just for this Earthly part of it really this is the very small part of our Christian Journey but the whole Christian journey is actually leaving this world and going into Glory I mean that's why Jesus died on Calvary that are that our sins we wouldn't just be forgiven but our sins would be taken from us amen his nature the nature of the Lamb our sacrifice we're coming to you and I he'd be the Christian in our lives he'd live a living testimony through us and then he'd take us in a Rapture amen he'd take us into Glory because you know we know under the blood of bulls and goats that the life of that animal could never come into the human being and change their nature so if they were born with a yeah we're all born with a fallen sinful nature and under the blood of bulls and goats that could never be changed but under the blood of Jesus Christ when his when his life comes into you the life and your lamb comes into you then then he changes your nature from unbelief into Faith amen where it's no longer doubting Fallen nature amen but it's it's the nature of God Amen as the Apostle Paul said the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God and the reason he could say it is because he met the Lord on the road to Damascus and the lamb the life of Jesus Christ came into him and transformed his life and I trust that is your testimony tonight that God Jesus Christ is not just a God to you in terms of a tradition or a story or a way of you're being raised but he became alive to you that he stepped out of history and you met him because you can meet him tonight amen he's a living God Amen and and he wants to walk with you and I yes amen so so they had to be dressed and they were ready to leave and I believe that we are dressed Amen in the wedding robe right now the wedding at the Holy Ghost the word is the waiting robe amen it would say in Revelations 19 for the bride has made herself ready let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage the lamb has come that Union happens on the side and we go to the marriage supper in the year amen amen because it was granted unto her she'll be a raid in a fine learning and clean and white which is the righteousness of saints Hallelujah so I trust that that is that is your testimony you're being robbed in his righteousness not your own righteousness that's but filthy rags but his righteousness amen and you've been you've you know you've put on the whole armor of God and you're ready to leave you know what I love about the um you know they left Egypt under the strength of that sacrifice and it took them all the way into the promised land where Moses would say many years later your shoes didn't wear out there's not a feeble one among you and the reason is that is because they took the Passover and the power of God came into their lives and they left and it's so important that we stay in Passover amen right we don't just we don't just have have a one-time meeting with God and that's it but we're continually walking with them having communion with them every day that we are living in Passover where we're becoming one with him all the time him and his word his word must become one amen it's not just it's not in here but in our hearts I mean because if we become one with his word it has out outflowing in our lives his nature how he would react to such you know your situations it's him that does it it's not our carnal nature that does it Hallelujah so you know we're living in a tremendous hour where where where God and his bride has become one I mean we've been United isn't it incredible thing where the great king of glory when he went to Calvary he had you on his mind and he said the joy set before him was you redeemed amen he looked beyond the pain and the scars and the rejection the mocking and everything he had to suffer he looked beyond that because he saw you on the other side imperfection rejoicing with him throughout eternity Hallelujah so you know I'm so thankful that God puts us in condition that we cannot miss the Rapture if you've met him right we cannot miss it you know many times we read down through first Thessalonians 4 The Rapture cycle we know we've heard the you know the shot is the message of the other the words gone forth The Gather of Bride and you know but but but we many times we just read chapter four and we finished reading but but Paul didn't put the chapter in verse in so the so the thought continues down into chapter five where he says but Brethren other times and Seasons I don't need to know you I mean tell you because you know perfectly well because you're because you're Children of the light not of Darkness that that day would overtake you as a thief I mean so we're dressed and we're ready to leave when he calls we're going Hallelujah amen praise the Lord Hallelujah so I think we should I think we should approach the table with such Thanksgiving tonight we're we're under expectation for the dead in Christ to rise amen we're under expectation for these bodies to be changed I mean we're under expectation to meet our Lord in the air where it's not just a pipe dream pie in the sky but it's a reality and that's why the Holy Ghost sweeps down service after service when you're praying or driving or wherever you may be and God just comes real close to you because he's because he's raising your expectation he's letting you know I'm going to carry you away one day it's not just going to be a sweeping feeling of his presence but he's gonna that presence is gonna so envelop us and and we're going to be changed before we realize it I mean all because of what he has done for you and I it's not what we have done it's what he has done what he has done matters what we do actually doesn't matter and his great economy remember we're not going to stand there on the on that side and say praise the Lord and what I did too right there won't be any praise directed at ourselves amen at what we have done for him it's it'll all be directed of what he has done for us and that's how it should be for you and I in our Earthly Journey right now when we realize that we stand because of the grace of God we were called by the grace of God we stand because of the grace of God we overcome by the grace of God we're Victorious by the grace of God that we overcome by the blood 11 the word of Our Testimony and our testimony should be God's word is true it can never fail amen it will stand the test and standard the test for thousands of years it will stand in this day like it did in every previous day and we will overcome that way Hallelujah why because our all-sufficient lamb our powerful lamb amen he's the mightiest one he conquered hell death in the grave amen there's nothing that he did not conquer everything is under his feet but you must have perfect confidence in your lamb amen because remember if you start to put the pressure on yourself what you've subconsciously done is put is actually you don't have perfect confidence in him anymore because your confidence is shifted because now you've come into the picture but if you're perfect if your confidence is in your perfect lamb there's no pressure on you there's pressure on him amen who's the one that fulfills the word it's not actually you and I he may use us to do it but it's him that fulfills it in our lives amen so we've got to have confidence if he's fulfilled his word in the past he'll do it again remember he did not call Israel to leave them right Caleb and Joshua took the Passover Lamb amen they left Egypt dressed Hallelujah and and Moses said there's a different spirit with them and that anointing upon them was the anointing of God and they took their promised land and I believe I'm looking at a room of people under the same kind of anointing Amen to take every Divine promise of God because God's given it to you Hallelujah so it is such a tremendous thing to think there'll be a time when we take this communion last time you know that that just like the you know the Lord Jesus you know it says that yeah yeah we call it the last supper There were suppers before this but they came to a last one and he knew this is the end of this it's going to be far greater than this it's going to take a lot of sacrifice I'm going to give my life to make it greater than this but but friends if you you know no Daddy looked in his eyes of his disciples because I didn't grasp what was going on and and maybe he thought if they only caught it they will when I race they will see they all understand what's all been done yes yes and I believe we're we're we've seen what he's done amen and we're under no expectation this could be the last time we take the Lord's Supper on this side this is the last opportunity because remember when you take because remember before they're they're in they're in um Egypt remember it was the family and the lamb was separate then the lamb was killed the blood was applied but then it wasn't only that they became one with their sacrifice and it's the same thing with you and I how do we know you know the reason we know the blood has been applied in our lives is because the life of our sacrifices come into us which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and then now it's no longer our sacrifice in us as a two we're now one it's just like when you when you we know there's just some symbolic of his blood and we know that unleavened bread is is symbolizing his body right but then after you've taken communion this and you are not separate you walk out it's part of you right it becomes part of your cells I mean you you know your body takes that food your takes the wine takes the bread digestion and then it becomes part of your body yeah that's the same thing with our sacrifice spiritually he becomes part of us as we become part of him that means there's no longer us living it's him living in US so this is a very sacred thing oh yeah you know this is a tremendous thing amen where we can we can come and we can make a public declaration saying I and My Sacrifice are one it's no longer either liveth but Christ that now liveth in me Hallelujah amen so I trust you're dressed and ready to leave this world amen let's um let's just go to First Corinthians 11. I just wanted to keep it short because we want to have the comedian have foot washing as well because we know the two go hand in hand so we're just going to go to First Corinthians 11 and we're going to read from verse 23 because we know this is a very rejoicing time I know I'll probably say this every time it is a rejoicing time my sins are gone I'm saved hey man I'm redeemed by the blood of the Lamb when I couldn't save myself he came down and saved me so glory to God I wasn't looking for him but he was lucky for me and he found me amen because it's not it's not within man to seek after God if you've got a hunger for God that's God put it in you that's a supernatural move of God Amen if you've got a hunger for righteousness that's God doing that it's not you you didn't choose him he chose you I mean so it's a it's a rejoicing thing but now it's like but but they were told don't have any living get rid of all the leaven yeah so don't have any malice Strife Envy backbiting Pride arrogancy anything don't have that kind of living in your life when you come and take the communion sweep it out of the house right so it's a very it's a very sacred thing too because remember or well let's just read then we'll come to it it says in verse 23 here for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same man also he took the cup which he had when he had sup saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for pardon me as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that drink eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home for ye come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so the Apostle Paul makes it very clear we've got to examine ourselves Lord do I have any unforgiveness do I have any ought does he not have any ought against me is anything that's not not made right anything is not under the blood in my life that's examining right and that's what we need to do because it says many are sick and many sleep because of this right so it's not just something we come and take casually and this is just part of church what no no it's not about that you're making a public declaration Me and My Sacrifice have become one so it's no longer my Humanity living but it's crisis Living Through Me so I think we should we should approach this you know you know approach the Lord's table with Thanksgiving but also with utmost sincerity and reverence so make sure everything is fine amen so um let's just stand tonight shall we uh brother could've been do you want to come forward brother Ed uh you know the deacons but yeah let's just let's just pray together we're going to pray for the for the bread and the wine and then um when you feel to come forward you can come forward I mean but um yeah let's just um amen so amen okay let's just bow heads as we as we dedicate Our Lives into the Lord's hands gracious father Lord once again we bow our heads in our hearts Lord unto you Lord we want to thank you so much Lord you have made us ready Lord Jesus it's not us and our
