[0:00] oh
[0:03] yeah
[0:04] and this is a song that uh was one of my
[0:08] one of my favorites as a teen in in my
[0:11] 20s and the Lord just reminded me of it
[0:15] very recently
[0:17] um
[0:19] with uh trials that I'm going through
[0:21] [Music]
[0:26] I was standing
[0:29] on the air
[0:32] of the Cliff of despair
[0:39] I don't know why
[0:44] but I didn't care
[0:51] before
[0:52] [Music]
[0:55] oh he reached out his head
[1:00] pulled me to his side
[1:05] oh this Jesus of mine
[1:12] so when you're running
[1:21] when loneliness sets in
[1:26] oh he is your best friend
[1:30] when you don't know what to do
[1:34] to call on him he'll see you through
[1:39] this Jesus of mine
[1:43] [Music]
[1:47] when you think you've had a worse and it
[1:53] hurts
[1:55] everywhere just remember
[1:58] Calvary
[2:00] and the Christ he had to bear
[2:05] when you feel like breaking down
[2:09] know that he is all around
[2:14] Jesus Jesus of my
[2:18] mind
[2:20] [Music]
[2:23] there have been times
[2:28] when I thought I was through
[2:32] and I searched so hard
[2:38] I didn't know what to do
[2:43] but then I just looked back
[2:49] I remember all those times
[2:54] when you reached out his head
[3:00] and he took a hold on
[3:03] [Music]
[3:22] holy is your best friend if when you
[3:27] don't know what to do
[3:30] it's all on him he'll see you through
[3:35] this Jesus of my
[3:40] [Music]
[3:43] mind when you think you've had a worse
[3:47] and it hurts
[3:50] everywhere just remember
[3:53] Calvary
[3:56] and the cross he had to Bear when you
[4:01] feel like breaking down
[4:04] know that he is
[4:09] on Earth Jesus
[4:11] [Music]
[4:24] [Applause]
[4:29] Jesus of thousand
