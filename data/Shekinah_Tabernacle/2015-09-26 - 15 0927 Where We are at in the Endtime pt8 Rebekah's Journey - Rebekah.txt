sister Robin back God bless you it's good to have you home amen God bless you amen God back amen safe me right praise the Lord Amen brother Peter's welcome to have you with us brothercome at amen now let's uh my my precious wife asked me last night when are you going to get out of Genesis 24 people are going to start asking like brother brand when are you going to stop preaching about get off theh I said well I don't know anyway we're still there so we'll go to Genesis 24 we'll just read a few scriptures there and uh 61- 65 and then I just want to read SC from Hebrews 12 and so uh so we'll just start reading from from Genesis 24 and verse 61 and we'll just go down to verse 65 and it and it and it speaks this and says and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon camels they followed the man the servant took Rebecca and went his way and Isaac came from the way of the well of laari for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself amen amen there let go to Hebrews chapter 12 and I just want to uh read uh verses 18 down to verse 24 of Hebrews chapter 12 and we're going to spend a bit more time in the uh Hebrews the 12th chapter so if you want to keep it handy uh uh later on we'll come back to it but so this is Paul speaking of now where where where we have come because he's speaking to a people a Hebrew people have come out of Judaism but he's pointing them on now you must go on you know you've you've you know you've received Christ in a way but you must go on into Perfection let us go unto the perfect man and you know he's calling them to to to go beyond where they are and he says now in verse 18 He says for ye are not come into the mount that might be touched that burnt with fire nor unto Blackness and Tempest I mean unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the sound of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if as such a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or th thrust through with a d and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto a mountains uh but yet come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly uh and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats so if I'd like to title this I I'd like to uh I want to speak about Rebecca's journey and you know just to uh some of these things I've already covered but you know just as one of my my chemistry lecturers told me at University he said in a you know in a lecture you know if he repeats himself there's a reason and it's to emphasize some things so some of this will be a bit of of a review but you know we understand that Rebecca you know from her journey from where she was in in modern day Iraq and to up to where where Isaac was was a long distance it was an incredible journey that she took and we understand from from Genesis 24 that Genesis 24 is a prophecy and that prophecy is being lived out today where God has sent an Alazar you know into the Earth and he has you know sent a sent a messenger into the Earth your God governing the whole thing to find a bride for Isaac to find a bride for Jesus Christ so we can see already that the alaza has come he's not here anymore he wasn't you know as soon as he introduced you know Rebecca to Isaac he he he went off the scene cuz he wasn't important his message was the important thing and so now we can see that Rebecca and Isaac we have become one with Christ but I want to just go into this a little bit because Rebecca you know we understand that the Book of Genesis now I'm not I'm not trying to inject anything into it but we understand that her journey her journey from from her her father's house into Isaac you know Sarah's tent you know that whole journey encompasses the Christian walk and the Book of Genesis it's called Genesis because it's the genus the seed chapter so it's everything's condensed but it you know grows out as as things go along so you know we we understand that the very camels that Rebecca watered now are the same camels that took her to her Isaac and I just want to read this it just blessed me and I'm just going to read the whole thing this is from earnestly contending for the faith listen 53 he says a little woman down in New Albany had been crippled 17 years draw up I never knew her in my life the Holy Spirit told me where she was at she was an Armenian her name was Mrs ohania Mrs Daryl ohania she was crippled up and I walked in there I seen her she looked like a spider drawn up in a bed her younger uh her young daughter 17 years old Dorothy they lived up there at 1900 Oak Street in New Albany this has been years ago and there I went by I said now that's the house he showed me I went down to the house the girl came to the door and I said how do you do she said how do you do I said she looked at me real funny Mr Merl you that read it in my book uh had been healed up there at uh St Edward's hospital and it had come out in the paper said are you that man that went down and healed that man I said no ma'am I said isn't there a lady here that's crippled up said my mother said step in and she was kind of like backwards she was a young lady about 17 I guess she had on her brother's shoe she kindly stepped back to one side and there laid this old woman said that that's her that's the one I said sister what are you reading she said it's an Armenian Bible I said Do you believe she said ever since I seen the paper about that man being healed I said there's hopes for me I said God has heard your prayer he sent me that I might pray for you and the woman jumped out of the bed running around over the house perfectly normal and well right to her or go see her many of the people in the neighborhood heard the screaming and they thought there was a funeral service it was an old person died and was born again again all right when she came out of there they said she's excited that's all she she just got excited and let the muscles down in her legs about 5 years later I was standing in the butcher shop I seen her through the glass come in she walked in with her husband she touched me on that arm I acted like I didn't see her I looked over this way she touched me back here and I looked uh this other way she said I fooled you didn't I I said no she said brother Brandon you remember a long time ago they told me I was excited I said yes ma'am she said I'm still excited because I'm still walking amen then you'd better get excited brother excitement don't heal the sick the power of God is what heals the sick he says it's the evening time uh evening lights are falling remember it was Isaac that wanted a wife when the Father Abraham sent the servant out a very beautiful type of God the Father sending out for his bride to get his bride a servant the Holy Spirit alasar and it was in the cool of the evening when the beautiful Rebecca came out to water the camel you know the story and the Beautiful Rebecca come out and he said who now who uh ever who Waters this camel he said Lord let that be the one you've chosen and Rebecca went and watered the camel and give them a drink and then watered uh his animal look the very animal that she was watering the animal represents a beast amen of course a beast of burden which means a power in the Bible and the Very animal that shs water was the very animal that packed her to see her her bridegroom is that right and what is watering the very power that we're watering now with praises and with Thanksgiving and glory and power and might is the very holy spirit that will pack us up to see Jesus someday look it was in the call of the evening when Isaac walked out some people say what if you see him and he's a real dark Jew if he's this I don't care what he looks like he's my savior and when the bride sees him it'll be love at first sight when Rebecca Isaac she jumped off the camel run to meet him it was love at first sight I tell you when we see him it'll be love at first sight off we'll go and a well will go into his arms certainly how beautiful the bride the evening lights coming the faith that was once delivered to the Saints beginning to restore back to the church the Fig Tree is putting forth its buds she begin to move out the evening light the very same gospel that was preached on the day of Pentecost the very signs that followed for 30 odd years after that down in the church has returned back to the church again falling right down to the End Amen so we can see you know I just I wanted to read that first part because it just blessed me she says I'm I'm still excited cuz I'm still walking amen amen I'm still walking with the Lord so I'm still excited Hallelujah so we see here that you know this this power that we worship you know our lord Jesus the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in another form to the same one that we worship and we love that we're watering it's going to pack us to see him in the air amen so now she made that great decision she said I will go amen and now you may read Genesis 24 and you say well if you're placing us on the journey does that mean we haven't become one with him yet I say no we have become one with him because the marriage supper is up there but the union takes place here and so there's a people now you know there's a people upon the Earth that received the alasa call they have met they have received the alaza call and that is and they are on their way to meet their in the air now we have become one with him now and I want to just clarify this because when someone hears the anointed word for their day and they receive it in faith it throws them into an invisible Union with Christ amen and we can see this perfectly well if you read Acts chapter 10 we have Peter there and Cornelius is a gentile and he would give to the Lord and he you know worshiped the god of the Old Testament and an angel came to him and said your arms have come up before God send men to joper go get Peter and he'll tell you what to do and and God was working on Peter's end as well and then finally the two came together where where Cornelius began to testify to his household and to the others that gathered said I had a vision of an Angel and and and he told now I'm going to go get this man Peter he's going to come preach to us the words of life and and then finally when when Peter came and and God was working on both ends and then all the people were stirred by one man having a vision and now they stirred because this Vision was be material where the man that was pointed out in the vision was standing in their very midst and then so Peter be to preach to them Jesus Christ and said while yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them and they marveled saying shall we you know these ones you know can we forbid water sing they have received the Holy Ghost like we did on the day of Pentecost and on the day of Pentecost Christ and his church became one amen and those Gentiles because they heard the word amen they heard the word from an anointed servant of God and that caused them to receive the Holy Ghost it caused them to come into an invisible Union with their bridegroom so now when alaza was speaking now to Rebecca and her receiving the message from out of his mouth and Faith had actually caused her to be come into invisible Union with Isaac yes amen amen because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God now and so Faith Rose in their hearts and they received what Peter was saying and they sealed into the Kingdom so they became United with Christ right there and it is the same thing now when we receive the word when we really receive it not in here but in here amen and we can look back and see my life is different now sure we have battles and struggles but something on the inside is pushing out and something on the inside is taking over amen we''re being thrown into a invisible Union with our bridegroom Hallelujah because a gentile faith is different to a Jewish faith because the Jews always said to Jesus just come and lay hands on them or you know comeing and like you know D and his daughter he said come and lay hands on her and she'll she'll come back alive but the Gentile faith is not that way amen and we see this in in Matthew chapter 8 where a centurion would come before would would would would come before the very Lord Of Glory and he would inrig to him because he had a servant that was sick and he came to him and said Lord come you know he says now he says in saying Lord Lord my servant lieth at the home sick of ay grievously tormented and Jesus sayith to him I will come and heal him so he was going to go lay his hands upon him you know and pray the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed so this Centurion had a revelation that Jesus speaking the word sending his word was exactly the same as him physically standing in the house and laying his hands upon the servant because a gentile Faith recognizes God and His word are the same thing Hallelujah so now when a Messenger stand stood in this day and and the truth of the Bible would be unveiled now and it was Christ being preached now that was the same as Jesus himself standing there in physical form Hallelujah and by receiving that word we've become one with him amen so now that is that is a gentile Faith he said I want more of Jesus everything that Jesus is present amen God has fully revealed himself in this end time oh I want to see him just look into his word and you'll see him amen as we Behold Him we change from glory to glory how do you do that you just listen to the word read the word pray amen it'll transform you if you let it transform you amen now we are on a journey like like Rebecca was traveling from where she lived to a different land that she never heard about Hallelujah and we are on that same journey to leave this earth amen and we see that now when when Jesus would stand and and he would begin to speak in in John chapter 14 he says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in Me and My Father's House of many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will receive you unto myself that where I am not where you are where I am there ye may be also amen now this preparing a place we understand that he has spent these last 2,000 odd years preparing a place for us but then he says now because in my father's house in that father's house if you uh if you bring it into the modern language of house is a kingdom yes amen so he says he's actually saying in my father's Kingdom there are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself now and he said that that where I am you'll be also so what we have is Jesus is saying in a future event he says I will come again and I'll receive you to myself that where I am so not in not because remember he was lifted up amen Acts chapter 1 physical form was lifted up and they didn't see him again in that way and so he's saying that that where he is where his physical body is amen there you will be also but then when he when he says he'll come again and receive us that receiving now is God preparing us to go to that place hallelujah amen because we understand it's the same thing with the you know with the wedding uh feast and things in the Bible terms someone would come to the door and Jesus speaks about it there's only one door into the feast you know someone comes in doesn't matter if they're rich or poor or whatever they were they're anointed their feet were you know washed and a robe was put on them so they were prepared now to come in to the feast Hallelujah they just had to come to the door that's all they had to do they received an invitation they came to the door the respective of good or bad you know it didn't matter of their status in Life or what they thought of themselves as long as they had the invitation they had a right to come into the feast amen and and the and the one over the feast prepared the guest to come in it's the same thing now here is he says I'll come and receive you to myself he he must prepare us in order to be received and that's why he died on Calvary for you amen he shed his blood to make us perfect in him amen and then the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the very life of the one that died comes and dwells in you and that prepares you Amen to come in amen hallelujah amen so he's saying that where he is you'll be also so this now when God himself comes amen and reveals himself amen that is actually a part that is the receiving I'll receive you unto myself it's all part of the receiving yes because now when God speaks now and we Faith cometh by hearing and it caus us to become one with him that means that's where that person's being received into the kingdom yes GL amen you following me yes because if you're sealed by the whole who has the holy ghost that means you're sealed not just anointed but you're sealed in that means you're sealed into to the day of your Redemption you have you've been you you've been actually already received now you just got to be ushered up into glory glory amen yes you know I think if we really recognize what we have yes amen the war between God and man is finished amen he has he has come to reconcile us back to himself and if you've met him he has amen that means you've been received amen so this message because this message is Jesus Christ revealed amen so I'll come again he came he he's not because we meet him in the air in a physical way but but this message is Jesus in word form because he is the word so now he says I come to receive you and this message is part of the receiving amen hallelujah thank you Lord that's right and then because we must understand that it's like in the first Exodus with Moses the people who really received the tree of Moses yes they came under the full effect of that word they were they went into the promised land they left Egypt and they went into the promised land and you take and then you can take the same thing in you know John the Baptist day here comes a forerunner he's preaching the people come under the influence of that Ministry amen and then they and then the whole purpose of that Ministry was to start following Jesus Christ and they did and then after John has his head's cut off and he's put in the gra all these things in they say why did the scribes say Elias must first come amen they didn't even understand what was going on but they came under the effect I know I've said this before but I just want to Anchor it in because many times we look at ourselves and say I'm not worthy I can't do it and yet your life is fully manifesting what it's meant to amen you're living out the intent of the messag Hallelujah and then so they had no idea and they had the very purpose of John they had met that purpose living out that purpose and they couldn't grasp fully who was this man on the River Bank whose words stirred my heart very strangely no other words did Hallelujah Hall the same thing with this message friends amen amen this this is Supernatural this God coming down in these last days Amen to visit his visit his church amen to prepare her to take her up into glory amen if your heart has been turned something in you says this is true Beyond how you feel or how Victorious you think you are you say has my heart been turned something in me says this is real something in me believes in spite of all the doubt and all the questions and all the critics amen and all what everyone else is doing something me says yes and God proves it to you and says this is me hallelujah hallelujah what's happening now you've come under the effect of it and you're on your way amen glory hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now I put a part of this on WhatsApp yesterday but I I I was just reading above and I was just so blessed this is from the Lamb's Book of Life okay I'm going to get into really what this is all Foundation basically he says what are we scared what we scared about listen to me my weary brother the Bible said that Jesus was the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world notice now this Burns how this burns your heart how this gives you the hope way back before the foundation of the world when Satan perverted to evil God being infinite looked down through the stream of time and saw the end for knowledge if he don't know all things you have a limited God you have made him finite like you and I but God is unlimited God's power God's knowledge everything he's omnipotent way back before the foundation of the world when Satan done the evil cuz Satan had in his mind what he was going to do then pardon me God seen how he could counteract it amen the Bible said in the beginning was the word St John 1 and the Word was with God and the Word was God in the beginning when time began it was eternity before that it was this is in time we're talking about eternity is like a panoramic uh it never ends it's a circle continually forever and forever and forever it's an endless wheel that never stops or never has an end to it but Satan put a break there and come down here and would have spoiled the whole thing but God seen where there' be a space of time and being the great infinite one from the beginning to beginning he he looked down and he was in the beginning the Worden now a word is a thought expressed God begin to think as he begin to see every human being that ever come on the earth and every bird and every flea and every fly Hallelujah that makes that makes him the Almighty etern ever present God that's the one we serve this morning way back in the beginning when he seen that there was some people that was going to desire to be saved some people who was going to want to be saved some people who would be loyal in their heart they wanted to be saved then he's going to make a preparation for their salvation say well I had no desire to be saved before I heard the word faith cometh by hearing amen and when you come under the sound of the word something in says you I want that I may not obtain to that now I may feel unworthy but something in me says I want it that is the desire to be safe that God put in you remember God put it in you you didn't put it in you amen amen God put it in you he says now they wanted to be saved then he got to make a preparation for their salvation that's right or they will never be saved and he knows that anything imperfect cannot come into heaven so he has has to make a way for Perfection uh for that amen you see it then back there he said I myself will come down into the world and take on human flesh I'll pay the penalty that's required there and I'll take the place and I'll make them perfect because I'll bring them in me and I am perfect then when Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even uh even as those that God is perfect then here was this mangled body that was beaten and bruised for sin and every sin in the world ever had or ever would have was laid upon him and he is the body that the je that the Jehovah raised up in the last days there on the third day after his death and if we are in that body we are just as perfect as the body is amen there you are how do you get into that body how do you get in the Bible says in Romans 8:1 that's therefore no condemnation to them that which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but the spirit they don't care what the world says or what anybody else says or even what their family says they uh they walk in the spirit of God in perfect Divine love you see it how do you get into it by journeying Church by shaking hands by water baptism no sir uh the 12th chapter of First Corinthians by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body being members of that body and then it's not what I've done what I am who I was or nothing about it it's what God has done for me in Christ and we are perfect with sacrifice he makes no mistakes now no you just listen he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't worthy amen he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there's traps all along the road Shore the devil will cause you to stumble yes and say God I don't mean to do that God you know it you're still perfect because a perfect blood offered for you for every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging over Before the Throne of God Almighty that's rightl how did you get in there God by for knowledge now God said that Jesus Now put on your caps get uh you get open your heart look the Bible said that Jesus was the lamb slain from where the foundation of the world he was slay why God the father when he looked down and seen Jesus never come just to die a hap haed death death yes he never came and say well maybe somebody will have pity when they see the way I die and everything no it wasn't God don't run his business like that God runs his business perfect that's right he knows exactly what was going to take place that's where he could force uh forese he knows exactly he's not willing that any should perish he's not willing but if he is infinite he knows who will and who won't therefore you can rest assure if you have received God and been filled with the Holy Ghost hello you're anchored to your Eternal destination correctly amen amen he forn knows yes amen hallelujah now watch now I'm just sorry oh I actually don't apologize I'm just reading now watch the Bible said that Jesus the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world uh was ever laid uh he says I know I act funny up here I feel glorious look Jesus was slain before the world even had the first Speck of dirt laj Jesus was already slayed why because God here it do get it God by for knowledge when he was the word in the beginning he perceived the thought now it's just a thought but when he spoke it said it shall be Jesus was slain yes the very minute God spoke the word then what 4,000 years later he come and paid the price that God had already done back then already spoke it now believer have you got your joy shoes on Amen have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you're a Christian if you're truly God's child the Bible said that's not a preacher that's the Bible it said your names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh my the same time that Christ that God sent Christ to be slain he wrote your name with his Hallelujah glory amen you see so what are we what are we afraid about amen amen what are we afraid about hallelujah hallelujah he said remember he says he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy this is a direct quote from brother Brandon amen I don't feel worthy forget it amen he wouldn't have called you if you weren't worthy he wouldn't have brought you in if he didn't think you're worthy didn't know you're worthy Hallelujah that's right amen so now Hallelujah now but often you know I'm I'm still you know sing to my subject but often we think of the Christian War cuz we see Rebecca she gets on the camel she goes straight to Isaac yes amen amen that's what's recorded because in God's word often the important things are recorded uh but there was many it's like 500 odd miles from where she was to where she was going could have taken a while on a camel back right but there's no record of any hardship of any things they had to endure you know all all that's recorded as she went on the camel and she went with Alasia to meet her Isaac and often we can think of the Christian walking the same way amen where everything is sunshine and smiles once you meet the Lord and everything's going to be well but we understand and I'm sure we all understand that the Christian walk isn't always sunshine and smiles but there's a lot of hardship and bitterness that that a a Believer must endure now remember the Christian walk is not always trials it's not always hardship amen it's not always a bad time there's a lot of good times amen and there's more good times than bad hey when you receive God that's the only good time you ever need have you been sealed in that's all that matters your Eternal destination is settled no one can you can't change it the devil sure can't change it and God is not going to change it amen but you know so so the Christian walk is not all struggles amen if you're going through a struggle just keep walking with God doesn't matter remember this is a faith walk amen if you have to go through wait amen if you have to go through all kinds of things I just was meant to put this on my notes but we'll go to the book of Isaiah am I want to read you some things Isaiah 43 amen we have confidence I tell you what we have Supreme confidence amen I I settled it in my heart a few years ago if God wants me at a wedding supper table yes amen the only reason I'm there is because he wants me there in spite of me he'll get me there if he wants me there I believe he wants me there amen that's why he receed me here is because he wants me there am me so we don't need to worry about whatever we whatever bombardment The Guns of the devil and all these things amen it only releases us the fire the fire released the Hebrew children in the furnace did it not they went inbound but they didn't walk out bound it was the fire that set them free Hallelujah you say I'm in a furnace it'll just set you freeall amen hallelujah we have Supreme confidence I have Supreme confidence whatever we're going through oh it's terrible no doubt it probably is terrible yes but God allowed it God ordained it amen God has confidence in you and he's got confidence in his salvation amen hallelujah amen God doesn't leave us just CU we've got bad days God doesn't leave us just cuz we got dis appointments God doesn't leave us just cuz we're going through a hard time it's been years God doesn't leave you just because it's been a few years amen Isaiah 43 Verse one you listen but now thus sayith the Lord who created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel remember we Are Spiritual Israel so this applies to us don't put it back to them it applies to us feir not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name has he called you by name he said I've never heard my name if you've heard if if this word is spoken to your heart that is God calling your name that's it thank you Lord so you have heard see I have called thee by name Thou Art mine amen amen now when God declares ownership over something good luck trying to argue that's it and sometimes we struggle and we say you know don't agree with because the devil tries to tell you you don't belong to God he doesn't care about you look what he did to even the garden yeah has God said a distant God who doesn't Express himself it's not the Lord God that reveals himself has relationship yeah has God said this distant one and he comes to you God isn't close to you God doesn't care he isn't in a relationship with you if you're really in a relationship with him why did this happen hallelujah amen you know this what he does it's his method all the way down yes amen so now he tries to tell you you don't belong to God I'm sorry if your name is being called by this message you belong to God Amen and that settles it praise the Lord when thou passest through Waters and look he doesn't say when you walk up the Grand highway and everything's Rosy when thou W when thou passest through the waters I will be with Thee thank you Lord and Through Rivers they shall not overflow thee say it's pretty deep they shall not overflow thee when thou West Through the Fire amen Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and sea for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou H has been honorable thank you Lord and I have loved thee therefore I uh will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee amen I will bring thy seed from the East and gather the from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my daughters from far and my daughters uh my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth everyone that is called by my namej for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have I have made him thank you Lord forth the Blind and that of eyes and death that of ears let all nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth hallelujah ye are my Witnesses sayith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior I have declared and have saved I have showed when there uh when there was no strange God among you therefore ye are my Witnesses sayith the Lord I am God and you can just keep reading through see he's saying when you go through the fire amen this is this is God's covenant with youall this is God's promise to you I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee Amen in the good times all the bad I'll be with you amen amen when you feel rejected I'll be there when you feel misunderstood I'll be there when things try to come into the home I'll be there Amen in the workplace I'll be there at school I'll be there Amen in your life I'll be there no matter where you go I've caused you to go this way Hallelujah you say well why would God take us through things you know you read the Journey of Israel leaving Egypt into the promised land they they they're delivered with a Mighty hand amen they go through the Red Sea and God tells Moses they didn't end up there haphazardly yesen God told Moses you go read it walk here then come here then you'll come down here God directed their steps right to the Red Sea right to where it looked like going to be the biggest Massacre there there would ever be at that time God ordained it and then God opens the Red Sea and they come through and their enemies are defeated behind them and they have a good old Pentecostal meeting there and then when Miriam takes a Tambour when they start to dance and Shout on the on the River Bank what a great Victory time oh are they just going to keep ascending in this great big time God didn't ordain it that way Hallelujah they walk for 3 days without water and they come to a place amen oh finally there's water here we can drink and our animals can drink and they begin to drink the water Hallelujah and it's bitter amen there's a bitter a bitter pull yes amen now let's just go to Hebrews chap 12 I just want to read a bit more I want to read above what we read cuz Paul is admonishing here you know there's things God allows us to endure things and to experience things and they're not always good yes amen that's right and sometimes we like to Major on the wonderful glories of being in the presence of God and our Christian walk like that and God comes down and God speaks to us we have such a wonderful time and those things are all true and real amen hallelujah but there's another part of the Walk where we need to remember this is all part of the Walk amen and so now we'll read Hebrews 12 and we'll just we're just going to read we're just going to read now uh from verse three of Hebrews 12 and we'll go down to verse 15 and and we are going to come to the later part if we have if we have time permits for he considered him that endured such a contradiction of sinners against him lest they be weed and faint lest ye be weired and faint in your minds ye have not resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for when the Lord for whom the Lord loveth amen he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receives if you endure chastening God deal with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement therefore ye are wherefore all our partakers then ye are bastards and not Sons not legitimate children furthermore we have had uh furthermore we have had fathers of of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verely for a few days chasen us off after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present Seth to be joyous yesen but griev us nevertheless afterwards it yield us the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight path your feet that which is lame be turned out of the way and let it be rather healed follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently least any man fail of the grace of God least any R uh root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so Paul is actually laying out something here cuz this is all part of the journey it's all part of the journey and so now if God loves us he'll correct us amen amen who's been corrected by him Hallelujah who's you as Paul said no one enjoys it sometimes you just feel like your very he's been stripped off your B when God when God puts a finger on something and it's not just one time it's all the way down the thrat God puts aing on something and you feel like you feel like this big right amen but God's dealing with you because this chastening is actually a correct thing amen you know cuz God loves us like we love our children amen and and you say well it's pretty it's pretty it's pretty hard what I have to you know what he's dealing Me on he does it cuz he loves you amen he does it if he didn't do it he he he doesn't love you Hallelujah that's right thank you Lord deal with us I pray amen and now but you see now he comes down now and he actually says now wherefore lift up hands which hang down and feeble knees and make path straight he's saying actually Rejoice amen don't don't don't become don't let it you amen don't let it make you go sideways in your walk but lift up your hands and praise God say thank you Lord I've lost everything but you're chastising me amen you're dealing with me as a son dealing with me as a daughter amen now they came they came to this place this this uh it's in Exodus 12 oh no sorry in Exodus 12 is when they take the Passover yes and when he's in when there when Moses is instructing the people it says roast it with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs why why is there why is there a bitterness that must be Associated why would there be bitterness associated with the very sacrifice that means Death Shall Not Touch the house what a glorious Deliverance they had that night but yet there was a bitterness associated with that with that with that Passover Lamb yes and it is the same thing with us there is a bitterness amen Jesus Jesus lived a bitter life amen but he didn't let it make him bitter that's right amen it didn't let him he when he died on Calvary he said father forgive them they don't know what they doing if he let his bitter life get a hold of him he would have cursed them yes in the name of God yes amen he would have he would never have gone to Calvary he would have called Angels you know I just need to say a word I've got whole bunch of Legions of angels and they're all brother said they're all waiting there amen Michael and and wormwood all these mighty Angels they're saying just nod your head when he's when he's taking the beatings and all these things he they're all stand there just nod your head the prophet says and we'll change the whole picture amen and if he was bitter he would have said you know it would never have got to that place he would have wiped out the whole thing amen amen he would have done it and he could have done it all power is given unto me he cursed a fig tree Jerusalem get into the sea and the whole thing would have moved he could have rained far down out of heaven like Sodom Gomorrah if he wanted he could have done it amen he's the very Creator in flesh he can do what he wants he's Sovereign amen but because he didn't let the this these things become bitter he could lay he could just hang himself there they didn't need Nails amen they didn't need to put him there he would have he would have hung there amen why because there's no he didn't let anything become it didn't become bter than you amen H and so now they came to this this is in Exodus no sorry this is in Exodus 15 where they come to this place called Mara which means bitter amen and they drink and they say the whole you know this whole place is bitter yes amen now many others would have come to the same pool many others would have been journeying and they would have come to the same pool and they would have drunk the bit of water and they would have no doubt seen the tree that God told Moses to cut down yes amen and throw in to make it sweet they would have seen it but God didn't tell them to do that to make it sweet that they could drink amen he he following me amen it was in God's season now when God's children were coming through this place where those Waters would turn sweet amen and the I'll say this the bride of Christ is the only one upon the Earth that experiences in life that make people bitter yes they are the only people that have the thing that can turn that experience into a sweet thingl amen that can take the busness out of the experience because that tree we understand brother Brown speaks about and he and he and he says that that tree was Calvary amen that was chopped down amen put into the water to make it sweet that people could drink that's right amen so now GL we are here we must understand this is why this is why Paul is saying lift up the hands that hang down you know and the feeble knees and all these things he's saying because this you have something that can turn the bitterness of your life or the things that make you know the things you don't understand amen you can take those things amen and take it and then so it's not bitter to you anymore but it's actually sweet amen hallelujah they were still drinking the water the water was still the same water but it was changed so the experience was still the same but it was just changed amen because of one act that made it different and now brother BR said says this is in redemption in completeness and joy in 54 he says sometimes God has to lay you on your back with a sickness that the doctors say you're going to die God could give you uh God could give you a little special treatment so you'll love him a little more that's right amen he says some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood Jesus leads his church now when they were there and the waters were bitter and they couldn't drink God provided away a little old tree swinging there on the bank Moses cut it down and throw it in the water changed the whole thing to good sweet water now when you come up against one of your bitter Waters or something another like that there's a tree tonight spiritually speaking hanging over gol gotha or the world tonight that'll sweeten any bitter Waters that you may be led by remember they were LED they were led to drink of those bitter Waters yes amen amen that's right that Calvary will sweeten any experience he says many times we get into hard places and wonder how but I shut my eyes sometime and think Yonder on gol gotha where my redeemer bled and died for my life then my trial seem so little I just throw aide and walk on it makes it sweet it sweetens every experience I ever had amen he always sweetens it when I come to my Waters of Mara and remember the prophet went through very a lot of bitter times in life he didn't have a flowery bed of East that's right you know his life story any of those things could have made him very bitter against God incredibly bitter you know he said about you know every time a crossy child with cross eyes would come across the they never left the platform that way Hallelujah and the people had no idea what he had to endure amen the incredible bitter time you know you know you read about it you know every time he tells the story of when you his first wife hope dies and when Sharon Rose Dies he's in tears amen it's still it still cut you know he's very sad about it he's still you know devastated but he's not bitter about it and little Sharon Rose you know the story her eyes were crossing in pain before she died and because that happened to the prophet amen and he took it to Calvary and it became sweet it wasn't bitter anymore amen then he could enter into the burden of every crosy child that came across the platform he says hundreds amen amen were healed and the people had no idea the bitter Waters he had to drink amen for them to receive C sight you see hallelujah amen he just took it to calary amen that tree that's why I say we have what we need am me to make any bitter experience sweet am thank you Lord Jesus amen they say well I've been through terrible things he went through terrible things we've been through terrible things take it there's a tree hanging amen they can change those Waters to be sweet amen so this is where this is where you know God God took them when they came out from the Red Sea and we are not exempt now from bitter experience expences and that's why Paul says look diligently least any man fail of the grace of God or fall from the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so he's saying do not let so he's so he's not saying you won't experience bitter things because we do experience bitter things he says don't let it take root in you yes and defile you amen amen because at the end of the day when bad things happen to us amen uh it doesn't really you know it it all depends what you're going to do about it yes amen amen it doesn't matter if you're right you the other person was totally in the wrong yes you know it doesn't matter if they daylight robbery or whatever it was but are you going to let it be are you going to let it become bter or or is it going to make you better amen amen cuz remember brother Bram his wife dying his child dying that actually because he took it to Calvary it made him better yes am amen amen one incredible loss but it made him better didn't make him bitter that could have become a root of bitterness and it could have defiled him yes you see and so it's the same thing with us now people doesn't matter if they're in the you know Believers or whatever they are they can come and and total misunderstandings can happen and and the devil can just take that thing yes that's right and it turn into a big cowy tree that's it amen and what happens now is that if if if something happens against us and we don't take it to Calvary we can always be looking through yes it's like a lens it's you know you it becomes like a filter that's right and everything in life is now filtered through that through that complex or that experience yes yes amen amen even though things can can happen and they totally unrelated yes right different totally different place different time whatever it could be years down the road yes but because that root of bitterness is there that filter is there you will look at something different to really how you should be looking at it amen cuz that how else can you be defiled the only way a person can be defiled is if something takes you off the beaten path takes you off the rugged way you see and that's and that's why Paul is saying don't let a root of busness spring up amen amen cuz it'll it'll it'll put a filter in there it'll warp your whole War a whole person's warp yes amen so that's why Paul says do not let these things spring up will they try absolutely will they try and grow yes amen we have the same five senses we have the same emotional realm we have the same body as an unbeliever but the soul is redeemed there's a life in there that is more powerful than anything else yes Lord hallelujah that's right and that's why that's why brother Ram could overcome everything that happened in his life yeah you see and become better amen and these things happened that we could look and read them and see this is how God was in a man and this is how he overcame certain things in life yes that's why he shares testimonies and all these things he could have you know you read standing in the Gap I think it's standing in the Gap and he preaches about you know he wanted to he was this close to becoming just go up to Northern British Columbia that's right you know and just becoming a guide because the people were rejecting the message 1963 remember Jesus Jesus you know in in this l in church J says behold I stand at the door and knock he was kicked out and this had to be lived out in the ministry of the Prophet that's why when he moved to Tucson he says you know not one church has invited me amen why cuz and he he's standing at the door knocking amen amen so then he got to a place he says no I'm sick of this I always wanted to be a hunter I'm going to go up to Northern British Columbia be a guide and if God puts anything on my heart stomp out of the Wilderness like an Old Testament Prophet say thus say the Lord and preach or whatever then then go back up there what why is that he lost the feeling for the people because now something had because he'd been rejected now what had happened a root of buness was trying to spring up you mean it a prophet he's still a man amen just like us Elijah was a man of like passions amen so but then God came in a Sovereign Grace and God pointed out a couple of B on the street said if you go what you if you do what you want to do amen if you do what you want you'll end up like them yes and your wife will leave you in all these things he could have kept walking that way yes yes amen now that doesn't harm his salvation you understand yes our destination may be sealed yes but there's things we do amen yes how Victorious do you want to be in this life amen how Victorious do you want to be I want to be 100% Victor amen if he paid it all and his intention was people would just Crest every wave didn't matter if they had the submarine through a few they'll keep a float eventually yes amen amen you know and then so that he could have walked that way if he chose to CU God's a gentleman yes you mean but he's been walking he he was commissioned in 1947 whatever you whatever you know the angel of the Lord came to the cave whatever year that was great you know Ministry around the world all these things and yet down the end he let a choice to walk away and do what he wanted yes yeah absolutely amen you know Jesus poured himself out amen and it doesn't matter if the people hated him or whatever it was he just ped himself out now us being the bride of Christ we are called to the same same life not to give ourselves die die for the sins of the world that's been done he paid it all but just to pour ourselves out to live a selfless life not a selfish life a selfless life am and it doesn't matter about who the person is that comes to you you know brother B you know he said you know preaching a sermon you know Reverend you know Reverend Mr Lily see a Lily toils comes out of the mud opens itself up a bee comes and then a fly comes whatever comes he just he just opens himself up before the sun that Drew him out of the mud and yields himself amen amen and it's the same thing with us yes doesn't matter how old we are whatever we do you know whatever God has called us to do we are that same Lily amen amen we've opened ourselves up before the s o n yes shine on me oh Lord shine on me and it doesn't matter really what people do people can take advantage of you people I'm sure some people already have and some people will yes that's right amen doesn't me I'm talking about believer unbeliever make beli whatever it doesn't matter they use Jesus yes Simon you know that Pharisee he he had him invited to a feast just to make fun of him that's right but Jesus you know the prophet tells us wherever Jesus invited he goes amen and they were trying to make use of him but he allowed himself he didn't he didn't he said I've got one thing to say against the of course he did but he allowed himself to go imagine if he sat there and he and he was resenting this Pharisee and resenting all these Hypocrites and all these things and then now this woman comes to anoint his feet all these things he would have said what do you get out of here what are you doing amen but he lived a selfless life amen and we you know and you look at that whole situation he called that Feast he invited the guests alsoo woman could find Salvation in in his house amen so sometimes we can go on things in life you what am I doing here what's this all about there might be a woman with an alabaster box amen hallelujah that's right amen so now we must not let these things uh let us become bitter amen now that's why he says lift up your hands amen rejoice in these things rejoice in the hardship Hallelujah but then now Paul and we'll just skip a couple of verses but we'll just actually go to our text in verse 18 but Paul is saying now for ye have not come he begins to make a contrast says this is part of your journey Amen to be corrected to be chastised don't let Burness come in and defile you all that's part of your walk but then he says now but you have not come to mount mount Z I mean I mean Mount Si you have not come to the the law you have not come to these things which you've actually left You' have come to a different place and he says in verse 22 but ye have come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels now Mount Zion speaks of the Bride brother tells us the future home that Zion always speaks of the bride and he goes to a scripture in Isaiah 4 and he speaks about the daughters of Zion and he says now that always speaks of the bride and if I have it here he says now he says and when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof of the spring uh uh by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke by day and a shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the Heat and for a place of refuge and for a and and for a cover uh from storm and from rain if if you read the whole and he says Mount Zion speaks to the bride saying you have come to where the bride is you have come to the bride I mean you've been called to to to be part of this bride now it says into the Heavenly Jerusalem yesen he says unto the city of the Living God and we are remember we're Lively Stones built into the yes building amen so we are the Tabernacle of the Living God amen amen he says this is where you've come to where God comes and dwells in you amen and unto innumerable company of angels now this innumerable company uh it uses similar words as when uh John sees you know the 200,000,000 Devils come out of the river Euphrates it's such a high number that you know they couldn't really they didn't really have a figure in those days so he's saying now that you've come to a place where where God this this unseen realm is affecting where you live amen because before remember well this is this is me anyway before I heard this message I believe sure God is the same and God is real Jesus is real but it wasn't a a reality it wasn't a reality that God is alive and well and he's and he's really interested in what man is doing and Gathering his bride you know it wasn't such a real thing that God is is with us every day and is dealing every day it was a yes he's real yes he's the same but he's distant someplace amen and in the ministry of Jesus Christ what happened is he he causes disciples to see that there's so much more than what these eyes declare that's right but there's an unseen realm there's hell and there's heaven and there's you know and there's devils and there's angels and you know he made them you know he opened a realm to them that they did not know just fishing on a fishing boat or going to the synagogue as the same thing now when when Jesus Christ has made the same yesterday today and forever and not just in 1965 but in 2015 where we see God alive and well amen that whole unseen realm becomes a very real place to us now so he says you have come to an an innumerable company of angels that's right and angels are sent to minister to the ear of Salvation so we can see that even in our everyday life angels are influencing are influencing our Liv yes amen amen so we have come to an inumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven amen and that means those that are written in heaven is more than just on the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life yes amen and to God the judge of all now why would we come he says he says now you have not come to Mount Si and on Mount Si they received the law well that was a judge that was judgment that was the judge you know the law giv was there amen but but now Paul is actually contrasting saying you have come to a different Mountain amen and to God the judge of all you mean isn't he isn't he mercy and Grace he is but remember a judge has the final say the Supreme Court has the has the supreme authority in in any land you see and so now the judge he is he is the judge of all because he has judged just righteous am mean you read in John chapter 8 now where where the Pharisees and things they they they bring a woman caught in adultery you you all know the story and they drag her before Jesus they're actually dragging her before the lawgiver that came down on Mount Si they're actually dragging her before the Lord Giver so now he and and he he is supreme judge of heavens and earth they bring her to the highest court there is and they're expecting him to condemn the woman amen but then he says you know he begins to ride on the sand and all these things he says him that was is without sin Let Him cast the first stone amen and they all from the oldest to the youngest they drop their stones and they walk away and then he begins to say woman where are you accuses and she says Lord I have none was more than a prophet From Galilee or some some different guy Lord God God I have none neither do I condemn the go and sin no more so the judge now a amen the judge deemed her righteous amen the judge pardoned her of what she had done amen and so now the Supreme judge that's why you know brother Ram says about you know what is the attraction on the mountain you know when when the when the cloud is formed there over sunset Mountain he says that's our Lord up there and he says it's a supreme judge amen amen and the reason that all happened now is that God was showing he was showing he Jesus Christ is a supreme judge and a judge doesn't always just condemn people but he pardons people amen and then and then brother Brown tells us now you know imagine going into a court and and and you know you're guilty and you get the best lawyer you could and all these things and maybe he could you know get you off the case but there's still a question they says but when your when when when the judge became your attorney be you know became your lawyer the case is settled and it's thrown out and he said it's the same thing now with our lord Jesus the Supreme judge amen became our lawyer became our attorney Hallelujah and you know and the case is dismissed amen hallelujah that's why he is the judge of all amen cuz his judge is righteous amen his judge is perfect amen hallelujah and to the spirits of just men made perfect notice it doesn't say that the Flesh of just men made perfect it speaks of their Spirits yes I mean speaks of their real you know their real them because in the Bible Soul and Spirit the words interchangeable amen so he's saying and to the spirits of just men made perfect that's right so he's saying now you've come to this place and this is the condition of the people in this place amen he's saying they've been made perfect remember because the blood of Jesus Christ makes us perfect yes amen sinless sinlessly perfect glory amen so you know sure we got to mature and grow but we're sinlessly perfect I'm as righteous as God is righteous amen amen cuz I'm in him yes amen and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen now the reason we can say we have come to this place is because now I'm I'm probably you know um we understand the high priest remember we we've just had the day of atonement y kapo yes and the high priest you know had an an incredible function because without the high priest there's no forgiveness of sins you could have the Tabernacle you could have the sacrifice you could have the Levites but without the high priest amen the high priest has a supreme authority there amen and without that man amen there's no forgiveness of sins for the people amen and then now in the Old Testament there was the temple or the Tabernacle there there was the high priest and there was the blood were three separate things and then Jesus comes along and he's a high priest made after the order of mesc which means an eternal one amen and then he is the high priest this in the days of his flesh yes he is the high priest in him is the blood that's right amen and he's also the temple yes amen amen so he comes along now and they tell him what marvelous stones are these you know the temple and all these things he says in 3 days you know you know he said not one stone will be left upon another speaking of the you know the destruction of the temple this is all going to be done away with that's right and he was the real high priest standing with them with the blood amen that wasn't just going to offer it once a year but was going to offer it you know once and for all was going to perfect them which are Sanctified and then so now remember when when the high priest came out alive after giving the blood before the mercy seat then the people could Rejoice because their sins were forgiven so it's when the high priest reappeared it wasn't he went in but when he reappeared yes was the great moment amen amen so now we've had 2,000 years you know remember Jesus arose Mary saw him in the garden she says yeah he says don't touch me cuz I haven't ascended I haven't taken my blood up into the presence of God yet and then he came back down he say to Thomas touch the you know touch the holes and you know these things he said touch me now amen yes and remember he's our high priest so and then after that he he ascended up into heaven he sent down his holy spirit we had 2,000 odd years of the same way where the high priest has not revealed himself amenu but then in these last days he said the son of man would be revealed amen the high priest would be revealed and then you have a Ministry standing upon the Earth where he says you know he goes back to you know Sarah and God you know you know God visits Abraham in Genesis 18 and he says now you know Sarah was in the tent you know you know behind them amen he says now I now I'll turn my back amen and there's a woman standing on the platform here that's right and and he does these things over and over again CU he's showing now the same God that was there that became Jesus Christ in flesh has now reappeared again in these last days amen so he turns his back says now I'll turn my back and tells the people this is what's wrong with them here and this is your name and all these things who is it say Jesus Christ revealing himself it's the high priest it is the high priest revealing himself so what happens now is the high priest has come out again Amen to declare yes amen the atonement has been accepted Hallelujah your sins have been forgiven you amen you're as perfect as I and I am perfect remember without the high priest amen and this to me transcends the argument which church is Right which church has the high priest which church which I'm not talking about I'm talking about believers amen you take any denomination which one has the high priest declaring itself amen you say well that was 50 years ago uhuh amen that's right that same one is still alive with us well how do you know who's pass from Death To Life who's been quickened who sees this begin to express itself more and more every day who's been delivered amen who has a new life that's com to them it's not them trying to live it but it lives out of youall that is that you have the high priest hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah cuz remember if you have the high priest you have the blood amen if you don't have the high priest you don't have the blood amen hallelujah amen amen that's why it says we've come Amen to the blood amen amen to Jesus now so he's saying now this is where you've come and this is where we are yes amen we're not at the bottom of Mount Zion we've come to the top we've come to the fin in amen we've come we can say we have the high priest cuz we've seen him appear in these last days amen hallelujah and that to me changes everything yes amen because if you high have the high priest you have the blood if you have the blood you have forgiveness of sins amen amen if you have forgiveness of sins you're going in a Rapture Hallelujah Jes amen now why do you say that because the Bible says in John chapter 5 and we'll just read it together and I'll try and close on this remark he says this Hallelujah and brother Bram uses this scripture quite a lot remember do not let the devil if you believe who who's a Believer who really believes amen amen Faith sometimes is belittled yes amen yes faith is incredibly revealed Faith amen if it's been revealed to you yes don't let the devil ever try and belittle that amen amen Hallelujah cuz he says here St John 5:4 now this is a bright scripture amen and I'll explain I'll show you he says verely verely this is why I say this is why we have come amen we have the high priest verily verily I say unto you amen he that heareth my word yes and believeth on him that sent me yes hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from Death unto life what is the condemnation that great wi Throne judgment amen he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me who's done that who's heard his word in this end time amen has ever has present now everlasting life you already got it if you already knew if you only knew you know just from Christ mystery of God revealed if the church only knew her position she will one day then the Rapture will go yes sir Hallelujah you say well I I have this Humanity I struggle and all the I have ups and downs I fly after handle amen just take it to Calvary it keeps happening just take it and leave it and keep walking hallelujah hallelujah we're going to war we're always going to war against this flesh but greater that is in you more than just in the world more than this more than than your natural you feel yourself going bitter against people selfish you know all these things recognize it that's not the real you amen take it to Calvary leave it there yes Lord amen amen he that Hearth my word believe on him that sent me had everlasting life it shall not come un the condemnation but has passed from Death unto life amen and that's more than just audibly hearing it a lot of people heard Jesus preaching yes only 120 were in the upper room yes Amen to hear the word is it for to hear it in here amen amen hallelujah hallelujah why are these things important because you know trying to go back to Hebrews chapter 12 Paul is saying this is where you've come he's trying to get the people he's trying to get these Hebrew Believers say you're not back here you're up here yes amen amen and that's what this message is is is trying to do this is what God has been trying to do for 50 odd years people have been walking with him for how long yes amen he's trying to get the people when you've been birthed now he tries to open your eyes this is what I've done this is your position in me this is the devil's position under your feet amen you may go through bitter times you may go through wonderful times and you will go through wonderful times remember the Christian walk is not all trials that's right amen you say well maybe this is just how it is and I just trudge along no I mean counter all joy amen counter all joy and just keep pressing on it'll be worth it all when we see Jesus H you just think that the your first 5 seconds in heaven the first 5 Seconds when you see the dead in Christ rise say I've never seen anyone die in Christ they will cause you to recognize amen they are one of them and you're one of them that's why you're seeing them just think of that and it's all done hallelujah amen all these things we have to and try and destroy us it'll mean nothing amen those first 5 Seconds think of it it's all done I'm looking for that time are you sealed in
