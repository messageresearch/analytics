[23:15] hallelujah amen you may be
[23:19] seated I just keep getting these words
[23:22] let the um let someone share a
[23:24] testimony like this obvious someone's
[23:27] got a testimony
[23:28] and so this is your
[23:30] opportunity to to take
[23:33] courage and share what the Lord has done
[23:37] for you or testify what faith is saying
[23:41] according to the
[23:43] promise someone's got a testimony today
[23:47] so here is an opportunity to share
[23:50] Sister
[23:54] Louise have we got some fire in here
[24:07] it really hit home to me how the Lord
[24:09] cares about the small things and I
[24:12] honestly I was sitting there marking in
[24:14] my diary um like the dates pay payday
[24:18] dates and dates when I was going to be
[24:19] paying my wrench and all that kind of
[24:20] thing I thought man it would be really
[24:21] handy if I just had a red pen CU I had a
[24:23] blue pen it was like I need to
[24:25] differentiate these things so I that was
[24:28] the thought I thought I might go and
[24:30] have a look through the drawers and my
[24:32] stuff that's in storage up being in
[24:33] Christine's so I seriously I walked
[24:36] probably about 10 steps toward the
[24:38] garage I stood in the garage doorway I
[24:40] looked to my left and there was a red
[24:42] pen so I just thank the Lord for being
[24:45] the god that sees the Small Things our
[24:48] small needs amen and our big needs and
[24:51] yeah provides so praise the
[24:56] Lord
[25:06] God bless you all um my walk with the
[25:09] Lord has definitely been very
[25:11] interesting and overwhelming for the

[25:15] many testimonies and all the glory to
[25:17] the Lord just the other day I was um

[25:25] so nice Lord if I could just get this
[25:27] one window and this entrance done and
[25:29] the rain just disappeared for about 2
[25:31] hours and then it came on down and the

[29:11] anybody else want to share sister ma
[29:15] praise the Lord thank you sorry I'm not
[29:18] too good at um public speaking but I
[29:20] just have a very big testimony yesterday
[29:23] um when we were coming from work from
[29:25] Fielding we almost had a had on
[29:27] collision with another car and it was
[29:31] a I don't know how to explain it but we
[29:33] were driving down and the other car on
[29:35] the other side was trying to overtake
[29:37] this truck and we saw it last minute and
[29:40] we don't know how we managed to get get
[29:43] out of this we don't know um I was
[29:46] driving and I think God just took over
[29:48] and I swayed the car left emergency
[29:51] break and the car behind me they were
[29:53] tailgating us as well but they managed
[29:56] to break too and
[29:57] the car just missed us so um we just
[30:01] want to thank God I don't know what we
[30:03] would have been saying today so all the
[30:05] glory belongs to God the Lord
[30:09] amen amen
[30:13] hallelujah
[30:17] hallelujah God bless you um it's it's
[30:23] um sometimes it's the little things that
[30:26] don't seem
[30:29] anything that actually are the big
[30:31] things I I have always had the desire to
[30:35] watch I'm a fun person to like watching
[30:37] I I learn a lot by watching not
[30:40] reading but then uh this this Welcome To
[30:43] Earth I've always wanted to watch it I
[30:45] know it was very expensive but somehow
[30:47] God made the girl to come over to my
[30:49] place
[30:51] and they we watched through this day
[30:55] anyway and God knew there's something
[30:59] that um in nature cuz he created nature
[31:04] and he speaks to us through nature so
[31:06] there was just this part that he was uh
[31:08] they showing how
[31:11] water in the waterfalls it when you look
[31:15] at with your own eyes it looks really
[31:17] magnificent but when you slow it down
[31:21] and you see the small particles of water
[31:23] dropping
[31:25] down it's mindblowing in itself and just
[31:29] to show how God created those small
[31:33] bubbles having air in them but then it
[31:37] may look like just flash of water
[31:39] falling
[31:41] down first Struck
[31:43] it it's like waves of just current going
[31:47] down and with time the rocks that are
[31:51] there they seem nothing but it's those
[31:54] rocks are shaped with the water that
[31:58] flows there over a period of years and
[32:01] years to be what they
[32:04] are sometimes we may feel like there's
[32:07] nothing happening in our lives it's like
[32:10] we are a standstill but nothing ever
[32:14] stops God is always at work and that
[32:18] just really so the whole of last year
[32:20] for me I was feeling like I was at a
[32:22] stand
[32:23] still and there's another brother who
[32:25] said that but when I watched that it's
[32:28] it's really just like
[32:30] wow you see the Rocks they're so
[32:33] beautifully done but it took
[32:37] years for the shaping of the
[32:39] waterfall to make them the way they are
[32:42] that it you look at it and you're like
[32:45] wow right now when we look at ourselves
[32:47] we
[32:48] like you cannot see anything but just
[32:53] time is of the Lord so that's just
[32:57] that's what I wanted to share sometimes
[32:58] you might feel like there's nothing
[33:00] happening but for sure there's
[33:04] something thank you
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:11] s God bless you everyone um awesome to
[33:15] be back um was a Sunday school today and
[33:18] everyone's back which is cool so we did
[33:20] a planning day today with the children
[33:22] so just like
[33:23] to just share testimony and just to also
[33:27] to pray that the Lord will provide for
[33:28] the upcoming year the children gave a
[33:30] whole list of things that's in their
[33:31] heart that they want to know about
[33:33] things that they are interested in that
[33:35] they want to see more of in the word and
[33:37] things like that so they've got a
[33:38] spiritual desire and then on the other
[33:40] side of the board they wrote all the
[33:41] natural things that they would love to
[33:42] do in the upcoming year so if we could
[33:44] pray that the Lord will provide
[33:46] spiritually which I believe he will
[33:47] speak into their hearts and molding and
[33:48] shaping them but also provide the
[33:50] natural side these children want to go
[33:53] overseas they want to go to the snow

[48:28] little bit here uh Luke 19 I just uh
[48:31] want to continue on with our you know
[48:34] zakus uh we kind of got him down the
[48:36] tree but we're going to put him back up
[48:37] the tree again and get him down again
[48:39] amen and then so
[48:42] um um so yeah so we're here in Luke 19
[48:45] and verse one sorry I don't have a
[48:47] slideshow um again this morning I I need
[48:50] to get back into that habit again so
[48:52] Luke 19 from verses 1 down to uh verse
[48:55] 10
[48:56] and then we're going to read a couple of
[48:57] verses from John 12 says and Jesus
[49:00] entered and passed through Jericho and
[49:02] behold there was a man named zakus which
[49:04] was a chief among the publicans and he
[49:06] was rich and he sought to see Jesus who
[49:09] he was and could not for the Press
[49:12] because he was little of stature and he
[49:14] ran before and climbed up into a
[49:16] sycamore tree to see him for he was to
[49:18] pass that way and when Jesus came to the
[49:21] place he looked up and saw him and said
[49:23] unto him zakus make haste and come down
[49:25] for today I must abide at thy house and
[49:28] he made haste and came down and received
[49:30] him joyfully and when they saw it they
[49:32] all murmured saying that he was gone to
[49:35] be a to be guested with a man that is a
[49:37] sinner and zakus stood and said unto the
[49:40] Lord behold Lord half of my goods I give
[49:43] to the poor and if I have taken anything
[49:45] from any man by false accusation I will
[49:47] restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto
[49:50] him this day is salvation come to this
[49:53] house for as much as he also is a son
[49:55] son of Abraham for the son of man has
[49:57] come to seek and save that which was
[50:00] lost amen and then we're going to go to
[50:03] uh John 12 and we're going to read
[50:05] verses uh 20 down to 26
[50:10] here
[50:12] um so yeah John 12: 20- 26 and and there
[50:17] were certain Greeks among them that came
[50:19] up to worship at the feast now this is
[50:22] the Feast of Pentecost I mean sorry the
[50:24] Feast of Passover the name came
[50:25] therefore to Philip and which was of uh
[50:28] besider of galile and desired him saying
[50:30] sir we would see Jesus I think that's a
[50:33] real good desire to have Philip cometh
[50:35] and tell Andrew and again Andrew and and
[50:37] Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[50:40] answered them saying the hour has come
[50:42] that the son of man must be glor should
[50:43] be glorified verely verely I say unto
[50:45] you except the corn of wheat fall into
[50:47] the ground and die it abideth alone but
[50:50] if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[50:52] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[50:54] and he that hateth his life in this
[50:56] world shall keep shall keep it unto life
[50:58] eternal any If any man serve me let him
[51:01] follow me and where I am there shall
[51:05] also my servant be if any man serve me
[51:08] him will my father honor amen let's just
[51:11] bow our heads in a word of Prayer of
[51:13] course we got to remember the Youth Camp
[51:15] again amen but if you have a need just
[51:16] want to slip your hand up to the Lord
[51:18] and say Lord remember me in prayer amen
[51:20] God bless you gracious father we thank
[51:22] you so much we can bow our heads once
[51:23] again in your presence and Lord Lord as
[51:25] we've just read the uh zakus had a
[51:28] desire to see you for who you were and
[51:31] the Greek said sir we would see Jesus
[51:33] and Lord that's why I believe we've come
[51:34] this morning that's what we want to
[51:36] speak about this morning Lord that we
[51:38] would see you so may you grant it Lord
[51:40] in the name of Jesus Christ and father
[51:42] we want to especially remember the Youth
[51:44] Camp that's going on in Ragin Lord I
[51:46] pray that Lord you would continue to
[51:48] bless the camp May pour your spirit out
[51:50] Lord may you touch every heart Lord fill
[51:53] everyone there with your Holy Ghost oh
[51:54] God set the captives free Lord Jesus May
[51:57] Sinners weep their way to Calvary may
[51:59] you have a may you have preeminence in
[52:01] that camp and we thank you for it Lord
[52:02] blessed by the hour and the church there
[52:04] for hosting it and Lord we just want to
[52:06] ask Lord as every hand that's been
[52:08] raised has a desire and a need behind it
[52:10] I pray you'd meet those needs according
[52:12] to your riches and Glory may you guide
[52:14] our steps Lord may we just love you more
[52:16] and more every day we thank you so much
[52:18] for your mercy for your blood just pray
[52:19] you cover us in your blood protect us
[52:21] Lord and may you be with those who are
[52:23] not here today Lord Jesus I pray you be
[52:25] the portion Lord we're so thankful
[52:27] you're mindful of us Lord wherever we
[52:28] are so Lord may you touch them as well
[52:30] and keep them in Jesus Christ's name
[52:32] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[52:35] have your seats this morning so I want
[52:36] to take if I could take that as a as a
[52:38] title of sir we would see Jesus now I
[52:41] think it's the Most Blessed desire that
[52:43] anyone could ever have in their entire
[52:44] life as they want to see Jesus Christ
[52:46] and now we know that when when when
[52:49] zakus you you it always struck me there
[52:52] you know we read there in Luke 19 where
[52:54] it says that he would he he sought to
[52:56] see Jesus who he was so to me zakus was
[52:59] looking he his desire was to see more
[53:02] than just a Man From Galilee we know
[53:04] Jesus the Bible would say there was when
[53:06] we saw him there'd be nothing of him
[53:07] that we desire him so he wasn't some big
[53:09] six foot something blond haad you know
[53:11] kind of an athlete kind of a guy he was
[53:13] a short man looked like anyone else but
[53:15] he wanted to look Beyond his natural
[53:18] appearance and see him for who he really
[53:20] was and I believe anyone who's really
[53:22] sincere and really really has that same
[53:24] desire they want to see Jesus and we
[53:27] know that Jesus Christ is the same
[53:29] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[53:31] change he changes his form but who he
[53:33] really is is still the same and that's
[53:35] why we can say the god of the Old
[53:37] Testament is the god of the new Jesus
[53:38] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[53:41] forever so we can the same desire that
[53:44] zakus had and those Greeks have we can
[53:46] have that same desire and they saw him
[53:48] for who he was now you think of zakus
[53:51] it's amazing that Jesus would say on on
[53:54] on on on you in the beatitude you say
[53:57] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[53:58] shall see God and the name zakus
[54:01] actually means pure but if you look at
[54:03] zakus and how he became Rich he was a
[54:05] chief Publican he was a tax collector I
[54:07] doubt very much he was a pure kind of a
[54:09] guy amen but you know he would you know
[54:11] he would pull a lot of shady deals in
[54:13] his life he would be you know because
[54:15] that's the reason when he came down out
[54:17] of the tree and I'm jumping ahead of
[54:18] myself but when he came down out of the
[54:20] tree he said Lord if I have if I have
[54:23] done any wrong to anyone I'm going to
[54:25] give half my goods to the poor and if
[54:27] I've taken anything by false accusation
[54:29] from anyone I'm going to restore
[54:31] fourfold so there would have been days
[54:32] when he would have had a real bad motive
[54:34] in his heart he would have dragged
[54:35] people before his uh tax collector chair
[54:38] you know there's a saying how Tax
[54:39] Collectors are all dodgy guys it must
[54:41] have come from somewhere you know that
[54:43] that that mistrust and resentment must
[54:45] have come from somewhere more than just
[54:46] people parting with their money or
[54:48] having to but you know zakus I think he
[54:50] had that kind of a kind of a way about
[54:52] him but you see he had a desire that he
[54:54] would see Jes Jesus now everyone I I
[54:57] believe who's really in their right mind
[54:59] has a Longing To See God you know more
[55:02] and remember zakus and the Greeks they
[55:04] weren't looking for an argument they
[55:06] weren't looking for a new code of ethics
[55:08] or an influencer on social media or some
[55:10] life hacks they were looking they
[55:12] weren't looking for a list of doctrines
[55:14] they weren't looking for a church they
[55:15] were looking for God they were looking
[55:17] for Jesus Christ himself and to me I
[55:20] think that's the Most Blessed thing to
[55:22] have is that we would have that same
[55:24] kind of desire now we know God is in
[55:27] nature God is in many things God is in
[55:29] his creation you know if you just look
[55:31] at if you look at if you really study
[55:33] nature you'll see God and you know
[55:35] brother Bram would tell the story when
[55:37] he wanted to go squirrel hunting he was
[55:39] actually squirrel hunting at the time
[55:40] with uh brother Banks woods and brother
[55:42] Banks was going to take him on this
[55:44] place that brother BR had never had
[55:46] never hunted on before but as they're
[55:47] driving up to the house there's an old
[55:49] man old woman owned this owned this uh
[55:51] property it was a private property but
[55:53] brother Banks knew the family and you
[55:55] know brother Braham was told by Brother
[55:57] Banks okay so so don't get out of the
[55:58] car when I get out of the car and talk
[56:00] to this man because he's an Infidel he
[56:02] doesn't like preachers he you know you
[56:04] he wants nothing to do with them so you
[56:05] just stay in the car and I'll talk to
[56:07] him and then so brother Banks gets out
[56:09] and and brother Banks knew him and you
[56:11] know they were talking back and forth
[56:12] and they were discussing different
[56:14] things and you know he asked brother
[56:15] Banks asked you know oh can you know can
[56:17] I um can I go hunting on your place go
[56:19] scroll hunting and and um and you know
[56:22] the old man said sure thing and you know
[56:23] but then brother uh Bank said oh you
[56:25] know my pastor's here with me can he can
[56:27] he come hunting with me and you know
[56:29] this old man said you know Banks Woods
[56:31] have you got so low down you got to pack
[56:32] a preacher with you everywhere you go
[56:34] and brother Braham thought that's about
[56:35] the time he should get out of the car
[56:37] now now he got out of the car he had
[56:39] half a you a week of Beed on him he had
[56:41] squirrel blood over his overalls you
[56:42] know he didn't look like a preacher but
[56:44] you know this old man looked at him and
[56:45] you know this old man didn't didn't
[56:47] think much of preachers he thought
[56:48] there's nothing you know really to do
[56:50] it's just a you an argument or something
[56:52] and you know and then you know they
[56:54] begin to talk about nature and you know
[56:55] there was a there was an apple tree that
[56:57] that man or his father planted in that
[56:59] yard and you know this man was now an
[57:01] old man and you know he would our
[57:02] brother B asked you know can I have one
[57:03] of those apples and and the old man said
[57:06] sure the yellow jackets are eating them
[57:07] you might as well have one too so he so
[57:09] he picked it up and now the time of
[57:11] season you know the time of year that
[57:12] they were hunting was it was just before
[57:14] Autumn but Autumn hadn't come in yet the
[57:16] first chill hadn't come into the country
[57:18] yet but yet this this apple tree and
[57:20] different trees around it had started to
[57:22] lose their leaves and so brother Brown
[57:24] began to ask man you know what what
[57:26] causes what causes this tree to lose its
[57:29] you know you you know the leaves fall
[57:30] off cuz the life of the tree is going
[57:32] out of the leaves into the sap and into
[57:33] the root so when it really freezes it
[57:35] doesn't kill the tree and and and
[57:37] brother brah asked this man this
[57:38] question and you know this old man says
[57:40] oh it's just it's just nature it's just
[57:42] you know it's just the seasons and
[57:43] things but then brother Ram said to him
[57:45] but but you see you see there's no um
[57:47] but there's been no cold chill yet what
[57:49] is telling this what is telling this
[57:51] tree that Winter's coming or Autumn's
[57:54] coming You' your life has got to go down
[57:56] to the roots that you don't die and this
[57:58] man you know kind of said you oh yeah
[58:00] it's just it's just nature it's always
[58:02] happened all these things and you know
[58:03] brother BR made a statement it sounded a
[58:05] bit ridiculous but you know but he said
[58:07] you know well what if you just get a
[58:08] bucket of water put it on a post you
[58:11] know that water's not going to run down
[58:12] to the bottom and run back up again when
[58:14] it comes to be Springtime there's got to
[58:16] be a Divine intelligence that tells the
[58:19] tree that wi winter is coming Autumn is
[58:22] sitting on and you know this man would
[58:24] say you know there is one one preacher
[58:26] that I'd like to see because we have
[58:28] neighbors over this way and you know you
[58:30] know you know the woman was dying she
[58:32] had cancer we'd go help her you know
[58:33] with the bed sheet and things she
[58:34] couldn't even get to the bathroom
[58:36] anymore my wife would go clean her house
[58:37] and different things and it was a few
[58:39] weeks ago and we just heard an awful
[58:41] record coming from the house it sounded
[58:43] like the Salvation Army was up there all
[58:44] the shouting and screaming and carrying
[58:46] on and you know we thought well well
[58:48] she's passed away so you know the next
[58:50] morning you know we better head up there
[58:52] and you know help help her husband get
[58:54] the body down to the the mor and
[58:55] different things but you know the thing
[58:56] is when we got into the house we found
[58:58] her she wasn't bed ridden she wasn't
[59:00] even remotely sick she cooked us apple
[59:02] pie and she was eating and she was like
[59:04] she was perfectly normal and well and
[59:06] and and and and this just didn't make
[59:08] sense to us cuz she was riddle with
[59:09] cancer she was meant to die and they
[59:11] would tell us that what happened was
[59:13] that the night before when all that
[59:14] screaming and shouting was going on is
[59:16] because the sister of that woman had
[59:18] come from a meeting and a preacher
[59:19] called her out and told her her name
[59:21] told her what was going on in her life
[59:23] told her she had a handkerchief and her
[59:25] in her in her bag and to take that
[59:26] handkerchief and lay it on her sister
[59:28] that was with cancer and she'd get well
[59:30] and that's what happened last night and
[59:31] so when the can um when the handkerchief
[59:34] was put on that woman am mean she she
[59:36] her health was restored that cancer was
[59:38] gone she was healthy strong and well
[59:40] again and then so this old man said you
[59:42] know I'd like to I'd like to uh meet
[59:45] that preacher and brother and see see he
[59:48] was preaching to me this Infidel was
[59:49] preaching to him and then you know
[59:51] brother BR said okay this is what we'll
[59:53] do we'll go H scrw hunting on your place
[59:58] and during that time you tell me what
[1:00:01] intelligence tells the sap of that tree
[1:00:03] to go down on the roots when it's when
[1:00:05] it's Autumn time and I'll tell you the
[1:00:07] same intelligence that told me that that
[1:00:10] woman's condition even the handkerchief
[1:00:13] was in her sister's purse all those
[1:00:15] things and I'll tell you who who God
[1:00:17] really is and see that man his eyes came
[1:00:20] open Hallelujah because he saw God he
[1:00:23] saw Jesus see he saw more than just
[1:00:26] nature and and and and and and natural
[1:00:28] things he saw more than an argument he
[1:00:30] saw reality and brother Braham led him
[1:00:33] to Christ and a year later you know
[1:00:36] brother brah went back hunting on the
[1:00:37] place again and and his wife who was now
[1:00:41] a widow didn't recognize him and
[1:00:43] actually told him to get away but you
[1:00:44] know brother Braham said to him but you
[1:00:45] know um but but your husband told me a
[1:00:48] year ago that you know we could come
[1:00:49] hunt here and and she said oh are you
[1:00:51] brother brandom and you know he said I'm
[1:00:54] she said that you know after you led my
[1:00:56] husband to the Lord a year ago he loved
[1:00:58] the Lord with all of his heart but he's
[1:00:59] gone on to be with the Lord now but you
[1:01:01] see he looked beyond it's beyond an
[1:01:04] argument amen see it's not Doctrine we
[1:01:07] hold to that's Jesus is more than a
[1:01:09] collection of ideas it's more than it's
[1:01:12] more he's more than a Doctrine he's a
[1:01:15] person he's a being he made you whether
[1:01:19] you realize it or not he made the planet
[1:01:21] that you live on he made this universe
[1:01:24] but yet he is so great he can come down
[1:01:26] and reveal himself to you and I that if
[1:01:29] we have a sincere heart we can see
[1:01:32] him amen so I trust you have the same
[1:01:36] kind of
[1:01:38] Desire see zakus brother brah he
[1:01:40] dramatizes a bit and he tells us that
[1:01:42] his wife Rebecca became a Believer
[1:01:44] became a believer in Jesus Christ and
[1:01:46] now zakus he was he was the chief he was
[1:01:49] the richest Publican in Jericho the
[1:01:50] richest tax collector that's a big deal
[1:01:53] but he but he started to see a change in
[1:01:55] his wife she became a different person
[1:01:57] after she attended those meetings and
[1:02:00] and he knew the scribes the Pharisees he
[1:02:02] knew the religious order of um Jericho
[1:02:04] but there was nothing in him that really
[1:02:06] he said it's just a bunch of hypocrisy
[1:02:07] there's nothing to it see he was looking
[1:02:09] at religion he didn't see the God that
[1:02:11] was meant to be represented in that
[1:02:12] religion he did not see am mean the god
[1:02:15] of Moses living in those people and so
[1:02:18] he just thought there's nothing to it
[1:02:19] but he saw the change in his wife and
[1:02:21] then that began to stir him up and now
[1:02:23] he he heard that that Jesus was actually
[1:02:25] going to come into Jericho and so what
[1:02:28] he did is he got up early that morning
[1:02:30] you know he was he was he was convicted
[1:02:31] he was all stood up and you know he you
[1:02:33] know decided to put his best clothes on
[1:02:35] that morning and he you know you know
[1:02:37] his wife was still tucked in bed saw him
[1:02:38] get up you know pretended to still be
[1:02:40] asleep and you know he got up got
[1:02:42] dressed into his best best clothes and
[1:02:44] he went out the door she began to say
[1:02:45] Thank You Lord you're working on him
[1:02:47] Hallelujah and then what happened is you
[1:02:49] know he would you know because he was
[1:02:50] short in stature he heard the Cry of the
[1:02:53] you know Jesus coming in into the City
[1:02:55] and he couldn't get through the Press of
[1:02:56] the people even though he you know tried
[1:02:58] to use his Prestige don't you know who I
[1:03:00] am you know Make Way for zakus you know
[1:03:02] but no one cared about him in that kind
[1:03:04] of environment you know God makes us all
[1:03:05] the same we got to realize that we can't
[1:03:08] come to God based on who we think we are
[1:03:10] I mean no but we want to see Jesus we
[1:03:12] want to come with a pure heart and then
[1:03:13] so now he would come and he couldn't
[1:03:15] because of the press he is a short man
[1:03:17] he couldn't see God you he couldn't see
[1:03:18] the Lord Jesus there so brother R says
[1:03:21] he actually pulled some a couple of
[1:03:22] garbage cans up against the tree to try
[1:03:25] and get up it because he couldn't get up
[1:03:27] to get that first limb of that sycamore
[1:03:29] tree and he tried his first attempt he
[1:03:31] slipped and he fell in the garbage can
[1:03:33] you know wiped himself off because he
[1:03:34] was worried that people would see him
[1:03:35] for you know being acting foolish but
[1:03:37] thing is he had something in his heart I
[1:03:40] must to see her I must see this man for
[1:03:42] who he is I mean I'm not coming to see
[1:03:44] him just to Discount him Something's
[1:03:46] Happened to my wife I want to see what
[1:03:49] this man has done to her am mean so so
[1:03:51] so he put the garbage cans dragg them
[1:03:53] back by the tree got on them somehow got
[1:03:56] up on the first limb the second limb but
[1:03:58] then he thought well you know I probably
[1:03:59] look a bit foolish people see me up here
[1:04:01] so he got real up high in that tree so
[1:04:03] no one could see him yeah so he and he
[1:04:06] opened the branches just a little bit
[1:04:07] and he was watching and he heard the
[1:04:09] noise of the crowd coming through he
[1:04:11] heard the hosas and the glories to God
[1:04:13] and he heard no doubt blind Bas who was
[1:04:16] now seeing Bas crying I can see I can
[1:04:18] see and but then he'd hear the Pharisees
[1:04:20] and the scribes saying get out get out
[1:04:22] of our city you're not welcome here
[1:04:24] don't listen to this man false prophet
[1:04:26] false prophet you know cancel culture On
[1:04:28] The Run trying to cancel Jesus you can't
[1:04:31] cancel Jesus amen you can try but you
[1:04:33] can't cancel Jesus amen but then you
[1:04:35] know finally Jesus walking along now we
[1:04:37] know Jesus was led by Vision he didn't
[1:04:41] haphazardly just see a tree moving and
[1:04:42] see zakus up there he knew he was there
[1:04:45] see Jesus knows where we are amen and
[1:04:48] he'll cause a meeting to take place that
[1:04:51] we can see him if you want to see him
[1:04:54] and so here comes here comes zakus I
[1:04:55] mean Here Comes Jesus now he it says he
[1:04:58] stands there he looks up and he says
[1:05:00] zakus come down and maybe zakus thought
[1:05:03] now how does he know who I am number one
[1:05:06] how did he know where I was number two
[1:05:08] how does he know where I am and how does
[1:05:10] he know my
[1:05:12] name God knows everything about you
[1:05:14] Hallelujah whether you realize it or not
[1:05:16] he knows more about you than you know
[1:05:18] about you amen but his but zakus because
[1:05:22] he wanted to see him for who he was
[1:05:24] see if we really want to see God God
[1:05:26] will really show us who he is amen amen
[1:05:29] so he really wanted to see him for who
[1:05:31] he was and then so zakus came down now
[1:05:34] as I said uh in the beginning zakus
[1:05:36] means pure but I doubt very much he
[1:05:39] started off as a as a pure individual
[1:05:42] but you see there's something happens
[1:05:44] when you really come into the presence
[1:05:46] of God with a pure heart you can't be
[1:05:48] the same right you cannot be the same
[1:05:50] you see zakus wanted to see Jesus for
[1:05:52] who he was he wasn't looking just on the
[1:05:55] outward appearance he wanted to see what
[1:05:57] is this man that's changed my wife what
[1:06:00] is this man and then when he looked at
[1:06:02] him he said
[1:06:03] Lord capital L O R D Supreme one not
[1:06:07] just Lord as an assur this is this is
[1:06:10] the same like the woman that was caught
[1:06:11] in adultery when Jesus is finished
[1:06:13] writing in the sand he says which of you
[1:06:16] have no have no sin Let Him cast the
[1:06:18] first stone and then from the oldest to
[1:06:20] the youngest all of her accusers dropped
[1:06:22] their stones and walked away cuz are
[1:06:24] convicted in their hearts of all the
[1:06:25] sins they had done and and and and you
[1:06:28] know and then he's there she's there and
[1:06:32] he just asked Heroman where are your
[1:06:33] accusers and she says there's none Lord
[1:06:37] so she realized this is more than just a
[1:06:39] religious leader that she was brought in
[1:06:41] front of this was God himself and zakus
[1:06:44] had that same Revelation this is God
[1:06:46] lord I will give half my goods to the
[1:06:48] poor and if I've done anything wrong to
[1:06:50] anyone I will restore them
[1:06:53] fourfold
[1:06:54] amen see so so when when he came into
[1:06:58] the Lord's presence it changed him it
[1:07:02] changed them amen these Greeks had that
[1:07:04] same kind of Desire now we would all
[1:07:07] love to be 2,000 odd years ago when
[1:07:10] Jesus was walking here on the days of
[1:07:11] his flesh wouldn't we wouldn't that be
[1:07:13] amazing wouldn't it be amazing to be in
[1:07:15] the boat he calms the storm wouldn't it
[1:07:16] be amazing to see a multiply the
[1:07:18] multiply the bread wouldn't it be
[1:07:19] amazing to be by lazarus's tomb and he
[1:07:22] comes out 4 days later you all those
[1:07:24] that'd be incredible but do you know
[1:07:26] that we we actually are more blessed
[1:07:28] today because that was God with the
[1:07:31] people we need God with us but he never
[1:07:33] the Lord Jesus never intended us just to
[1:07:36] have him have him with us he wanted to
[1:07:38] be in us because in order to see Jesus
[1:07:42] you have to see more than just his
[1:07:43] natural form because remember the
[1:07:46] scribes and Pharisees they saw Jesus
[1:07:49] they saw him they saw him in their
[1:07:50] synagogue man with a withered hand he
[1:07:52] just say stretch it forth he was healed
[1:07:55] they saw him do many incredible things
[1:07:57] yet they hated him and they wanted to
[1:07:59] destroy him yeah they weren't really
[1:08:01] seeing Jesus though they saw Jesus you
[1:08:03] know what I mean they saw his natural
[1:08:05] form they heard the same words that
[1:08:07] everyone else heard but something in
[1:08:09] them could not uh surrender to him they
[1:08:13] did not have a pure heart because when
[1:08:14] the scribes and Pharisees it's amazing
[1:08:16] when you look at here's the Lord Of
[1:08:17] Glory who Moses prophesied of all the
[1:08:20] prophets prophesied of coming the one
[1:08:22] that gave the LA on M sin was now made
[1:08:25] flesh here he was revealing himself but
[1:08:28] yet they wanted to argue with him is it
[1:08:30] lawful to do this why don't your
[1:08:32] disciples why don't they wash their
[1:08:34] hands before they eat why don't they do
[1:08:35] this why you know all these little
[1:08:36] nitpicking nonsense things that they be
[1:08:38] so they wanted to see Jesus just to
[1:08:40] prove him wrong they wanted to see Jesus
[1:08:43] to justify their own life and condition
[1:08:46] you see and we never want to come to the
[1:08:47] Lord to try and justify our own
[1:08:49] condition we need a teachable spirit
[1:08:51] amen we need to be Lord you're right I'm
[1:08:54] wrong in other words Lord your word is
[1:08:55] right and I am wrong compared to your
[1:08:57] word Lord if I think I'm right and I
[1:08:59] think your word is wrong take that
[1:09:00] Spirit from me amen CU it's one big sign
[1:09:03] you've got the Holy Ghost is you realize
[1:09:05] the word is supreme and you need to
[1:09:07] change if you are contrary to that word
[1:09:09] amen because what that is the spirit of
[1:09:11] Truth coming in and revealing revealing
[1:09:13] himself to you amen amen so they had a
[1:09:17] so so zakus had a desire now we would
[1:09:20] love to be back there but really in
[1:09:22] truth it's actually more blessed to be
[1:09:23] in day right now hallelujah amen so we
[1:09:28] know he is though the same yesterday
[1:09:30] today and forever now just just bear
[1:09:33] with me you know I pray the Lord would
[1:09:35] just bless us in some way am me cuz I
[1:09:38] want to see Jesus I don't just want to
[1:09:40] see him sure you can go back years ago
[1:09:41] when you first met him and all those
[1:09:43] things those testimonies you should
[1:09:45] never lose sight of but I just don't
[1:09:47] want to see him then I want to see him
[1:09:48] every day I mean I want to continue
[1:09:51] walking with him remember this is a
[1:09:52] relationship remember this message came
[1:09:54] to restore a true spiritual relationship
[1:09:56] between God and man that's the purpose
[1:09:58] of the message that that's the main
[1:09:59] thing amen that God would dwell in man
[1:10:02] once again and God and man would walk
[1:10:04] together as one that's the whole purpose
[1:10:06] of it amen so you see God God does not
[1:10:09] change amen that's one thing he cannot
[1:10:11] do is change he can change his form but
[1:10:13] who he really is is still the same now
[1:10:16] we know that's one thing see see brother
[1:10:18] baham says an unchangeable God working
[1:10:20] in an unexpected unexpectable way stay
[1:10:23] with the word God is infinite God is the
[1:10:26] infinite one who cannot change he's
[1:10:28] unchangeable the unchangeable God the
[1:10:30] same one that fell on the day of
[1:10:32] Pentecost and filled all the house with
[1:10:33] a rushing Mighty Wind and clothing
[1:10:36] tongues of fire sat upon them they were
[1:10:38] all filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:10:39] the same God that we look to see today
[1:10:42] it depends what you're looking for the
[1:10:43] infinite God I am and I change not he
[1:10:46] doesn't change he can't change see
[1:10:48] everything he was back then he is the
[1:10:50] same today amen amen he hasn't changed
[1:10:53] one IOD to just his form because
[1:10:56] remember the next time the physical body
[1:10:58] of Jesus Christ touches the Earth is
[1:11:00] when he comes back for the Jews we meet
[1:11:03] him in the air amen we will physically
[1:11:06] meet the Lord in the air we will
[1:11:08] physically see
[1:11:10] him these bodies will change we be
[1:11:12] caught up with dead in Christ and we'll
[1:11:13] meet him in the air but the next time he
[1:11:15] physically stands upon the Earth is when
[1:11:17] he comes back for the juice amen so we
[1:11:20] got to realize now that his spirit is
[1:11:23] here now now if you really want to see
[1:11:24] Jesus today you've got to see him as his
[1:11:27] word hallelujah it's absolutely
[1:11:29] fundamental you see him as his word that
[1:11:32] you don't get caught up in an imaginary
[1:11:34] idea of like the chosen or some drama of
[1:11:36] Jesus right but you see him as his word
[1:11:39] those things have their place right but
[1:11:41] that's not that should never be your
[1:11:42] absolute amen but you've got to see him
[1:11:44] in his word because he is his word as it
[1:11:47] says in John in the beginning was the
[1:11:48] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:11:50] was God then verse 14 the word was made
[1:11:53] flesh and dwelt among us we behold his
[1:11:55] glory the glory is of the only begotten
[1:11:57] of the father full of grace and truth
[1:11:59] amen so he is still his word today amen
[1:12:02] he is not changed he is still and that
[1:12:05] it's so vitally important that we see
[1:12:07] him in his
[1:12:09] word now brother B says in this message
[1:12:11] to see Jesus he says and so that's the
[1:12:14] way it is tonight those who desire to
[1:12:16] see God must come with a perfect heart
[1:12:18] what is that per what is that Perfect
[1:12:20] Heart Lord I want to see you I want to
[1:12:22] have a meeting with you I want to see
[1:12:23] you for who you are with all strange
[1:12:26] feelings set aside with all malice
[1:12:29] towards your neighbor set aside with all
[1:12:31] malice towards other churches other
[1:12:33] individuals and forms of worship you
[1:12:34] must come with that perfect Hearts could
[1:12:37] I see you Lord Jesus now I'm going to
[1:12:39] take all my superstitions away I'm going
[1:12:41] to seek tonight to see the Lord Jesus
[1:12:43] now I hope that's your intention every
[1:12:45] one of you and I believe that if you
[1:12:47] come with that kind of an intention that
[1:12:49] God is under obligation to reveal
[1:12:51] himself to you do you believe that this
[1:12:53] morning morning I mean don't you believe
[1:12:55] that the God is under obligation to
[1:12:57] reveal himself to you here tonight and I
[1:13:00] think it's so important when we approach
[1:13:01] God in any day that we don't that we say
[1:13:04] Lord line me up with you I remember when
[1:13:07] the Lord started dealing with me I I see
[1:13:09] just Lord take everything out of my life
[1:13:11] that's contrary to your word that you
[1:13:12] can dwell in me I didn't know what to do
[1:13:14] what not to do I didn't have a church to
[1:13:16] go to I just have the message in the
[1:13:17] Bible but I let God because I wanted to
[1:13:19] see him I heard he's alive he's the same
[1:13:22] yesterday today and forever the tomb is
[1:13:24] empty so I can meet him that was that
[1:13:25] was just me I thought I can meet this
[1:13:27] Lord Jes I want to meet him right so so
[1:13:29] I said Lord you just changed me to line
[1:13:31] up with you see we don't want God to
[1:13:33] change to line up with us he'll never do
[1:13:35] it cuz he can't change right we need to
[1:13:37] be changed to line up with him and
[1:13:39] that's why if we're really pure in heart
[1:13:41] we'll say Lord change me whatever's in
[1:13:44] my life that stops you get it out of me
[1:13:46] Lord I open my life to you Lord Jesus
[1:13:50] your word promises that I can see you I
[1:13:52] can experience you I can know you in the
[1:13:55] power of your resurrection that when I
[1:13:57] read the book of Acts I can when I read
[1:13:59] Paul's writings how he's how he says
[1:14:01] he's been Afflicted but not cast down
[1:14:03] and all trouble and all these things his
[1:14:05] experiences that you can step into those
[1:14:07] words because you've experienced the
[1:14:08] same kind of things I mean you can
[1:14:10] relate to the Apostle Paul you can
[1:14:12] relate to those in the book of Acts
[1:14:13] because the same spirit that was in them
[1:14:15] is in you amen you've seen the same
[1:14:18] Miracles you've seen God's leadership
[1:14:19] the same way because that same spirit
[1:14:22] that was in them is in you amen I trust
[1:14:25] that's the you know the desire of our
[1:14:28] hearts that we would Lord I want to see
[1:14:29] you
[1:14:30] today amen see we got to I think we just
[1:14:33] got to go back to Lord I want to walk
[1:14:34] with you people go churches have go gone
[1:14:38] off on tangents people have gone off on
[1:14:40] tangents because they they they forget
[1:14:42] the main thing is to be identified with
[1:14:45] the word to walk with him in Simplicity
[1:14:48] amen that all that matters is Lord I
[1:14:50] live to live for you because of what you
[1:14:52] have done for me I'm not trying to earn
[1:14:55] anything I'm just so thankful you mean
[1:14:57] everything that's why I've been trying
[1:14:58] to just like preach on praise and
[1:15:00] different things if we just keep him the
[1:15:02] focus of Our Lives that no matter what
[1:15:04] goes on in life he will give us Grace to
[1:15:06] go through it you know I had a um you
[1:15:09] know the Bible says that old men will
[1:15:11] dream dreams in the end time I guess I'm
[1:15:12] old cuz I'm Dreaming again but you see I
[1:15:15] had a dream I had a couple this week but
[1:15:18] I'll I'll just share a bit of one maybe
[1:15:19] I'll share the bit of but anyway I had
[1:15:21] this dream where where where I was back
[1:15:22] in my old Primary School in gizman W
[1:15:24] Beach School best primary school I
[1:15:26] reckon ever the girls don't believe that
[1:15:28] but I'll take them there one day but it
[1:15:29] won't be how it was when I was there
[1:15:31] that was the Golden Era anyway we were
[1:15:33] there and you know I was I was I was
[1:15:34] going to start running around the track
[1:15:36] or running around the field I started
[1:15:37] going for a run and so it was a dream it
[1:15:40] wasn't a nightmare you know but you I
[1:15:42] was having a dream anyway so I started
[1:15:43] running and I actually caught up to was
[1:15:45] like middle of the day I know some kind
[1:15:47] of time and I and and I caught up to
[1:15:49] this other brother I thought man he must
[1:15:50] be able to just to run cuz he's been
[1:15:51] running for a long time and he's kind of
[1:15:53] kind of puffing away and you know I just
[1:15:56] kind of pass up to you pass by and make
[1:15:58] a joke and keep going and but I found
[1:16:00] myself running on my
[1:16:02] knees so I'm not on my feet I'm running
[1:16:04] on my knees but the thing is it was
[1:16:07] effortless I was like I was gliding
[1:16:08] along didn't feel any strain didn't feel
[1:16:11] any problems and it really shows if you
[1:16:13] want to run this Christian race you got
[1:16:14] to run it in prayerfully you got to you
[1:16:16] got to run it in prayer amen that's how
[1:16:18] you walk the Christian walk prayerfully
[1:16:20] amen cuz remember prayer Keeps Us in
[1:16:22] communion with God you say but I have
[1:16:24] the Holy Ghost you to stand communion
[1:16:26] with the Holy Ghost in you you can't
[1:16:27] wander off in your carnal desires you
[1:16:29] need God to guide you every day and the
[1:16:32] only way to do that is Lord because
[1:16:34] remember part of the Lord's Prayer is
[1:16:35] not my um my thy will be done in earth
[1:16:39] as it is in heaven what Earth is he
[1:16:41] talking about he's talking about us he's
[1:16:44] not just talking about this plan he's
[1:16:45] actually talking about you because
[1:16:46] remember the kingdom of God is within
[1:16:48] you right so he's saying May thy will be
[1:16:51] done in earth as it is in heaven so in
[1:16:54] other words Lord change my thinking that
[1:16:56] it matches your thinking change my
[1:16:59] desires that they are your desires
[1:17:01] change my will that it's your will that
[1:17:04] that's what prayer should be prayer
[1:17:05] should be praise as we talked about last
[1:17:07] Sunday but prayer should be a surrender
[1:17:08] Lord change me to match you Hallelujah
[1:17:12] that's what God's looking for see he's
[1:17:13] looking for character Lord and his
[1:17:16] character in a people amen so you know
[1:17:18] so I found that you was just I was on my
[1:17:20] knees but just it was like I was gliding
[1:17:22] along
[1:17:23] and then I actually you don't have a dog
[1:17:24] e you don't have a dog okay maybe this
[1:17:26] be no okay anyway I came up to Reuben
[1:17:28] found myself by Reuben's crying cuz his
[1:17:30] dog had just died you know maybe don't
[1:17:34] get a dog I don't know but this is just
[1:17:36] a dream now okay but but there's Ruben
[1:17:37] here's cry sad and and and who wouldn't
[1:17:39] be sad if their dog died you know and
[1:17:41] you but I was just consoling him you
[1:17:43] know just from the scripture just from
[1:17:45] the message you know brother Braham you
[1:17:46] know his horse and his dog R beyond the
[1:17:48] curtain of time all that ever loved you
[1:17:50] and you loved will be there and his
[1:17:52] horse and dog will be there so don't
[1:17:53] worry this is not the end you this like
[1:17:55] life remember this is just a small part
[1:17:58] compared to Eternity this is a blip on
[1:17:59] the radar not even that just this
[1:18:01] Earthly Journey you know we've got far
[1:18:03] more to enjoy and look forward to amen
[1:18:05] than just this waiting room or this
[1:18:06] developing room that we're in of
[1:18:08] character right so I was just consoling
[1:18:10] with those things and I kept running
[1:18:11] along and then there's some brothers
[1:18:12] there and you know and and I was talking
[1:18:14] about you know how would you know we
[1:18:16] often think about how we would um how
[1:18:18] would we we react if we were like Daniel
[1:18:21] and he knows that if he keeps pray is
[1:18:23] going to be thrown in a lion's den or
[1:18:25] how would we be if we're Shadrach mesach
[1:18:26] and Abednego and we know if we don't bow
[1:18:29] we're going to be thrown into the you
[1:18:30] know thrown to the furnace and you know
[1:18:32] how would we react when great great
[1:18:34] great trials and things come our way and
[1:18:37] I just said you know what God gives
[1:18:39] Grace for every time you know you don't
[1:18:41] need to really think about how you're
[1:18:42] going to be you just walk prayerfully
[1:18:44] with God and then when Trouble Comes
[1:18:46] Your Way God will anoint you in the
[1:18:48] trouble you know I don't know if David
[1:18:51] ever had dreams of killing Giants but he
[1:18:53] found himself fighting a giant you know
[1:18:56] and really no doubt when he would have
[1:18:57] looked back at that he you know
[1:18:58] naturally he would have thought man that
[1:19:00] was crazy here's this man who's 11 foot
[1:19:02] or whatever I'm just a little youth you
[1:19:04] know how on Earth did I naturally this
[1:19:06] was impossible but God anointed me in
[1:19:08] the trial who's ever had that kind of
[1:19:10] thing when you look back you thought man
[1:19:12] how did that ever happen and because God
[1:19:13] stepped on the scene took over your life
[1:19:15] and did what he wanted to do amen so you
[1:19:18] know I think we've got to run this race
[1:19:20] more prayerfully than ever and that just
[1:19:22] doesn't does mean you're on your knees
[1:19:23] in your closet but prayerfully going
[1:19:25] through the day amen I Love You Lord
[1:19:28] you're so wonderful Lord hallelujah you
[1:19:30] talk to him have a conversation as
[1:19:32] you're going through the day who does
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:34] Hallelujah I pray I do it more I want to
[1:19:37] do it more right but you just have that
[1:19:38] prayerful attitude then as you run this
[1:19:40] race it will become easier because it's
[1:19:42] not your strength it's his strength amen
[1:19:45] it's not your ability no it's his divine
[1:19:47] grace hallelujah amen so if you want to
[1:19:49] if you really want to see Jesus amen
[1:19:51] come prayerfully with to him hallelujah
[1:19:55] amen amen praise the Lord now he says
[1:19:58] now where were we yes that's the
[1:20:01] intention now that we want to God is uh
[1:20:05] under obligation to reveal himself to
[1:20:07] you I mean if you come with the right
[1:20:08] kind of intention now if you come with
[1:20:10] that intention tonight let's find out
[1:20:12] who Jesus of Nazareth is and if we find
[1:20:14] out what he was in days gone by then
[1:20:16] we'll know what he is today is that
[1:20:17] right we know that uh what he was in the
[1:20:21] days that was we know what he will be
[1:20:23] today now if we could imagine uh if we
[1:20:26] could have an image of seeing him in
[1:20:27] that day with somebody described him to
[1:20:29] us and he was a tall or thin man heavy
[1:20:31] man whatever it was we'd be looking at
[1:20:33] for that type of man but the Bible
[1:20:34] doesn't say that a stature he was
[1:20:35] there's no beauty of him that we would
[1:20:37] desire him I suppose he wasn't a great
[1:20:39] big handsome tall man because the
[1:20:41] scripture said there's no beauty that we
[1:20:42] would desire him well then if the
[1:20:44] scripture says that we couldn't look for
[1:20:47] that type of man but the scripture
[1:20:49] doesn't exactly give a statue but the
[1:20:51] scripture does reveal him what he is in
[1:20:54] his power and in his manifest
[1:20:56] manifestation what he is now if we can
[1:20:58] read in the scripture and find out what
[1:21:00] he was then why we know what he is now
[1:21:03] is that right whatever he was then he is
[1:21:05] yet tonight for the scripture says he's
[1:21:06] the same yesterday today and forever is
[1:21:09] that right amen so if we look into the
[1:21:11] word we can see who he really is now
[1:21:14] this is not an intellectual exercise
[1:21:16] right we're not doing a class project of
[1:21:18] trying to you know answer a test here
[1:21:20] but if we can see him in his word
[1:21:23] I mean then God see if God reveals to
[1:21:25] you the scripture then God will manifest
[1:21:28] that scripture in your life when it goes
[1:21:30] who's ever had the um experience you you
[1:21:32] can read the same chapter again and
[1:21:34] again and again but in that time of need
[1:21:37] you read that it jumps out it grips you
[1:21:39] who's had that kind of experience see
[1:21:40] you see that is now that's now you
[1:21:42] really seeing Jesus cuz you're seeing
[1:21:44] him in his word amen you're not looking
[1:21:46] for you know because he is his word
[1:21:49] that's how you see him is by seeing him
[1:21:50] in his word see the apostle Paul would
[1:21:53] say in 2 Corinthians he says he says
[1:21:56] wherefore henceforth we know no man
[1:21:59] after the flesh he says though you have
[1:22:02] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[1:22:04] henceforth now we know him no more so in
[1:22:06] other words you have known Christ after
[1:22:09] the flesh because remember when when
[1:22:10] Paul was writing these things many of
[1:22:12] the apostles were still alive many
[1:22:14] eyewitnesses were still alive but he
[1:22:16] saying you don't know him that way
[1:22:18] anymore you cannot know him after the
[1:22:19] flesh anymore but you know him how do
[1:22:21] you know him now by by Revelation amen
[1:22:24] by divine revelation that's why it's it
[1:22:26] would be incredible to to to have an
[1:22:29] eyewitness account but to to walk by
[1:22:31] Revelation is far more powerful I mean
[1:22:33] that's why the Apostle Paul you know he
[1:22:36] wasn't there when Jesus was in the days
[1:22:38] of his ministry that you know he wasn't
[1:22:39] a disciple then but he met him on the
[1:22:41] road to Damascus what God revealed he
[1:22:43] saw Jesus amen and then he saw him in
[1:22:46] his word the same could you imagine the
[1:22:49] same Scrolls that he would study from
[1:22:51] his youth you know the Old Testament you
[1:22:53] know he he would have stayed those back
[1:22:55] and forward and back and forward but
[1:22:56] then after he met the Lord on the road
[1:22:58] to Damascus it was like he was reading a
[1:23:01] new book amen hallelujah it was a
[1:23:03] totally different Isaiah was a totally
[1:23:04] different book amen Leviticus or
[1:23:07] Jeremiah or any of those books were
[1:23:09] totally different why because he saw
[1:23:10] Jesus now in his
[1:23:12] wordu amen he made him as the pillar of
[1:23:15] fire and because the but but then but
[1:23:18] then he saw him in his word amen and
[1:23:19] that's the most important thing that we
[1:23:22] know the Lord Jesus by divine revelation
[1:23:25] amen see when the word is revealed when
[1:23:27] a promise or a scripture is Made Alive
[1:23:29] to you it grips you and then then you'll
[1:23:31] see it come to pass amen and when you
[1:23:34] see that scripture come to pass you are
[1:23:36] seeing Jesus amen amen because he is his
[1:23:39] word made manifest he is his word living
[1:23:43] amen like when you see Jesus when when
[1:23:45] when he came after his temptation in the
[1:23:47] wilderness there he goes into the
[1:23:49] synagogue and he's pass the scroll of
[1:23:51] Isaiah to read and he reads the prophecy
[1:23:53] from Isaiah 61 he actually found that
[1:23:56] place in the book so so he opened the
[1:23:58] scroll until he found that portion of
[1:24:00] scripture he says the spirit of the Lord
[1:24:02] is upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:24:03] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:24:05] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:24:07] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[1:24:08] the recovering of the sight of the blind
[1:24:10] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[1:24:12] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:24:14] Lord and then he closed the book and he
[1:24:16] gave it to the minister and sat down and
[1:24:18] all the eyes of the people in the
[1:24:19] synagogue were fasted on him he said
[1:24:21] this day is this scripture fulfilled so
[1:24:24] in other words what you just see what
[1:24:26] you see in my life is a manifestation of
[1:24:30] that prophecy that it's no longer
[1:24:32] prophecy it's now reality amen that's
[1:24:35] why he said this day is this scripture
[1:24:36] fulfilled so now he was saying so so
[1:24:38] what he was saying is what you read
[1:24:40] about in Isaiah you're now seeing what
[1:24:43] is he he is the word made manifest amen
[1:24:46] so in other words what he just read he
[1:24:49] is living out in front of their eyes
[1:24:50] amen and so that was the people who
[1:24:53] could spiritually see could look past
[1:24:56] the man and see yes his life does
[1:24:59] fulfill that prophecy yes I've seen him
[1:25:01] Open the Eyes of the blind I've seen him
[1:25:03] loose the captives I've seen him comfort
[1:25:06] those I've seen them bind the
[1:25:08] Brokenhearted I've seen him do these
[1:25:10] things and those who could really see
[1:25:12] him who are looking at a pure in heart
[1:25:13] would say yes he is fulfilling that
[1:25:16] prophecy amen and it was the same today
[1:25:20] as it was then because Jesus Christ is
[1:25:21] still his word see that prophecy of
[1:25:24] Isaiah there that Jesus read you know
[1:25:26] that same anointing is here today I mean
[1:25:29] because Jesus Christ is still the same
[1:25:30] yesterday today and forever amen so see
[1:25:33] his anointing still heals the
[1:25:35] Brokenhearted amen he still preaches
[1:25:37] Deliverance to the captives am mean
[1:25:39] that's why we can say by the authority
[1:25:40] of God's word if you want to be free you
[1:25:42] can be free am mean cuz he's come to set
[1:25:44] the captives free I mean to set us free
[1:25:47] from mind battles complexes troubles
[1:25:49] unbelief whatever it is he's come to set
[1:25:51] the captives free
[1:25:52] and the recing of the sight the blind
[1:25:55] amen that is would be applied to our
[1:25:57] eyes spiritually that we could see him
[1:25:59] in his word am mean and set at Liberty
[1:26:01] them that are bruised amen the anointing
[1:26:03] of God that's why he said Lord I want to
[1:26:05] see you cuz when you see when you see

[1:26:36] remember he has a lamp to our feet amen
[1:26:38] so if you search for him in his word he
[1:26:40] will guide you through those things amen
[1:26:43] praise the Lord isn't that right why
[1:26:45] because he is his word amen you see
[1:26:47] zakus wasn't looking at another
[1:26:49] religious man he was looking at God in
[1:26:51] flesh amen
[1:26:52] the Hallelujah it should be the same
[1:26:55] thing with you and I he saw the
[1:26:56] Prophecies of the Messiah living and it
[1:26:59] changed him amen those see it's the same
[1:27:02] thing today he is the same yesterday
[1:27:04] today and forever amen so when God in
[1:27:07] his infinite grace allows us to see him
[1:27:09] in his word the Bible becomes
[1:27:12] alive Hallelujah I trust I trust that's
[1:27:14] your heart's desire Lord I'm not a
[1:27:16] Christian because of an argument I'm not
[1:27:18] a Christian because it's a nice idea I'm
[1:27:20] a Christian because you've revealed Ral
[1:27:22] yourself in your word to me I mean you
[1:27:24] this this is no longer inkc on paper
[1:27:26] it's alive in my heart am mean The God

[1:27:34] amen see if you'll see him in his word
[1:27:38] in your and then the Y
[1:27:41] sorry if he reveals himself to you that
[1:27:44] his Word is Alive amen then that word
[1:27:47] that he quickens or reveals to you he
[1:27:49] will produce what it promised to do
[1:27:52] hallelujah it's like for example acts
[1:27:53] 238 if you can see the path of Salvation
[1:27:55] is to repent be baptized in the name of
[1:27:57] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[1:28:00] then you'll receive the Holy Ghost sure
[1:28:01] as anything amen if it's Quicken to you
[1:28:04] it's not just going through a motion cuz
[1:28:06] someone told you to do it but if you
[1:28:07] really see this is the path of Salvation
[1:28:09] amen then God God will change your heart
[1:28:11] I remember when I first you know first
[1:28:13] was listening to the message and brother
[1:28:15] BR preaching on Redemption and
[1:28:16] completeness and en joy and you know the
[1:28:18] Seal of God and things I just been I was
[1:28:21] baptized when I was 18 that's all I knew
[1:28:22] to do is Quicken to me that I need to be
[1:28:24] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:26] I was a sinner I was making home brew
[1:28:29] and I was gaming and doing all kinds of
[1:28:30] things I but but I opened my Bible to
[1:28:33] Acts chapter 2 I said Lord I don't know
[1:28:35] what repentance is he said if I repent
[1:28:38] and baptized this way I've been baptized
[1:28:40] right I don't know what repentance is
[1:28:41] but you said if I repent and be baptized
[1:28:43] you'll give me the Holy Ghost so show me
[1:28:45] what repentances Lord I don't know
[1:28:48] Hallelujah and he did he did why you
[1:28:51] just come you say Lord I need to know
[1:28:53] you well see seek for him in his word um
[1:28:56] I may be a broken record but you know I
[1:28:58] think it's very important you know
[1:29:00] there's all kind of self-help all kinds
[1:29:03] of ideas all kind of recommendations all
[1:29:05] kind of advice why don't we go to the
[1:29:07] great Fountain of true advice why don't
[1:29:10] we go to the counselor the Mighty God
[1:29:12] the Everlasting father well how do you
[1:29:14] do that in prayer in his word say Lord
[1:29:17] reveal me in here and Reveal Your your
[1:29:20] show me amen there's got to be see
[1:29:22] you'll find a Bible character in your
[1:29:24] situation God will lead you to someone
[1:29:26] you may someone in Kings or second I
[1:29:28] don't know somewhere but you'll be
[1:29:31] reading it and the Lord will say this is
[1:29:33] you amen and you'll see what they did
[1:29:35] you do the same thing and you'll get out
[1:29:37] he'll guide you through the trial amen
[1:29:40] amen
[1:29:41] hallelujah amen it's like if you you
[1:29:43] know you know if the Lord reveals to you
[1:29:45] that brother Brand's Ministry is the
[1:29:46] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 uh uh 45 and 6
[1:29:50] AM mean and you see yourself from that
[1:29:52] promise what is that promise behold I
[1:29:53] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:29:55] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:29:56] she he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:29:58] fathers to the children and the hearts
[1:30:00] of the children of the fathers lest I
[1:30:01] come and smite the Earth with a curse I
[1:30:04] but but but if God reveals himself in
[1:30:06] that scripture and puts you in that
[1:30:08] scripture he will turn your heart right
[1:30:10] back to original faith in the word again
[1:30:13] amen that's right amen where you'll have
[1:30:15] a genuine faith that the Bible is the
[1:30:17] word of God and it is all
[1:30:19] true amen so that's why it's so
[1:30:21] important that we come to God with a
[1:30:23] pure heart
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:26] amen now zakus as I said soorry if I
[1:30:30] feel like I'm going around the Miller
[1:30:32] bit but I said zakus means pure but he
[1:30:35] wasn't that way before he met the Lord
[1:30:38] now it's very so I doubt very much that
[1:30:40] zakus had any kind of Integrity pulling
[1:30:43] Shady deals to you
[1:30:46] know feather's Nest you
[1:30:49] see we have to have integrity in this
[1:30:52] day amen amen now Integrity is a a a
[1:30:56] firm adherence to a code of especially
[1:30:59] moral or uh artistic values I mean it's
[1:31:03] an unimpaired
[1:31:04] Condition it's a quality or state of
[1:31:07] being complete or
[1:31:08] undivided now Webster would say the true
[1:31:10] meaning of integrity it ties in with
[1:31:12] honesty Integrity implies
[1:31:14] trustworthiness and
[1:31:16] incorruptibility uh to a degree that one
[1:31:19] is incapable of being false to a trust
[1:31:21] responsibility or pledge uh Pardon Me
[1:31:25] Property it implies tried and proven
[1:31:27] honesty or Integrity see real Integrity
[1:31:30] is shown when no one else is
[1:31:32] around amen that you can be true and
[1:31:36] honest with Integrity if you're in a
[1:31:38] crowd or you by yourself and no one will
[1:31:40] know about it you see Integrity the
[1:31:44] Integrity it says in Proverbs 11 the
[1:31:45] Integrity of the upright shall guide
[1:31:47] them but the perverseness of transgress
[1:31:50] shall destroy them says in Proverbs 191
[1:31:53] better is the poor that walketh in his
[1:31:55] Integrity than he that is perverse in
[1:31:57] his lips and is a full Proverbs 207 the
[1:32:00] just man walketh in his Integrity his
[1:32:02] children are blessed after him amen so
[1:32:05] if you want children to be blessed walk
[1:32:06] in your integrity
[1:32:08] amen amen you
[1:32:10] see before before zakus met the Lord his
[1:32:15] attitude towards God was bad because
[1:32:18] brother Braham says that he says the way
[1:32:20] I treat you that's my attit ude towards
[1:32:22] God so so his attitude towards people
[1:32:26] was was selfish it was wrong ien but but
[1:32:30] but then when he came to the presence of
[1:32:31] the Lord his attitude came right why
[1:32:33] because his attitude towards God was
[1:32:35] right Amen brother bramwood would would
[1:32:38] tell us that you know if there's ever
[1:32:41] someone that's going to be a real
[1:32:42] Christian let's be one of them that
[1:32:44] people who will never read a Bible will
[1:32:46] look at your life and say that's a real
[1:32:48] Christian walking down the street amen
[1:32:50] be a um yeah be be a real Christian now
[1:32:54] the reason I say these things about
[1:32:55] zakus is because that's the things he
[1:32:57] said when he came down and saw the Lord
[1:32:59] that half of my goods I'll give to the
[1:33:00] poor and if I take anything from any man
[1:33:02] by false accusation I will restore him
[1:33:04] fourfold so obviously that's he had done
[1:33:06] all those things but when he saw Jesus
[1:33:08] for who he really was it changed him
[1:33:11] amen he didn't see a religion in front
[1:33:13] of him he saw God in flesh amen
[1:33:17] now now it's it's kind of funny well
[1:33:20] unusual when you think about just the
[1:33:21] the face Valley of it when when when the
[1:33:24] Greeks desired to see Jesus and then
[1:33:26] finally they're in the presence of this
[1:33:27] one that they had heard so much about
[1:33:30] remember John chapter 12 is obviously
[1:33:32] just after John chapter 11 John chapter
[1:33:34] 11 um Lazarus comes out of the Grave a
[1:33:38] man had been in the dead for 4 days had
[1:33:41] come back to life corruption had you
[1:33:43] know his body had been restored he'd
[1:33:44] come back so there's a lot going on Amen
[1:33:47] and and these Greeks were come up to
[1:33:48] Jerusalem for the Feast of Passover and
[1:33:51] they had a desire that that they would
[1:33:53] see the Lord so finally there in front
[1:33:55] of him but then the Lord makes a
[1:33:56] statement verely verely i s you except
[1:33:58] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[1:34:00] and die it abideth alone but if it die
[1:34:02] it bringeth forth much fruit and he that
[1:34:05] loveth his life shall lose it and he
[1:34:07] that hateth his life in this world shall
[1:34:09] keep it unto life eternal now that
[1:34:11] hating his life in this world doesn't
[1:34:13] mean that you hate your life and life is
[1:34:14] dumb and I hate being alive and you know
[1:34:16] like a depressed way that's not what
[1:34:17] he's saying about he's he's saying that
[1:34:20] he's saying that compared to eternal
[1:34:22] life compared to Walking with God your
[1:34:24] life is secondary right you don't love
[1:34:27] this world's vain riches and things more
[1:34:29] than loving the Lord amen but he's
[1:34:31] saying that a corn of wheat had to fall
[1:34:33] into a ground and die he's basically
[1:34:34] saying to the Greeks this is how you
[1:34:36] really see me see you have come to see
[1:34:38] me but this is how you really see me if
[1:34:40] you go through a death burial and a
[1:34:41] resurrection because a corn of wheat
[1:34:43] falls to the ground so it dies but then
[1:34:45] comes forth so it dies it goes into the
[1:34:47] ground the seed does but it comes forth
[1:34:49] in the springtime brings forth much
[1:34:51] fruit fruits was that a death a burial
[1:34:53] and a resurrection amen and that's the
[1:34:56] only way that when you that's the only
[1:34:58] way you'll really see him as when you
[1:34:59] die I'm not talking about naturally of
[1:35:01] course we'll see everyone will see him
[1:35:03] one day right because every knee will
[1:35:05] bow and and and every tongue will
[1:35:07] confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord
[1:35:09] right but the only way but we want to
[1:35:11] see him now we need to see him now not
[1:35:13] just then it's too late now some people
[1:35:15] say well I'll I'll I'll I'll sort it out
[1:35:17] with the big man when I get upstairs no
[1:35:19] you got to sort it out downstairs you
[1:35:20] got to sort it out downstairs first
[1:35:22] that's why he died on Calvary if you to
[1:35:24] be ready now right because it's too late
[1:35:26] upstairs it's done amen Mercy's now not
[1:35:28] up there right amen so that's why yeah
[1:35:31] let's let's get our accounts cleared
[1:35:34] amen amen the only thing that's written
[1:35:36] and read on our account is pardoned by
[1:35:38] the blood of Jesus Christ amen see you
[1:35:41] see you'll see him when you die when you
[1:35:43] come to Calvary and are crucified to
[1:35:45] yourself then you'll see Jesus we would
[1:35:47] see him see that's the but but you see
[1:35:50] the thing is many people they try to
[1:35:51] hold on to some Creed or trying to you
[1:35:54] know obey some rituals and I say even
[1:35:56] even as message people people are very
[1:35:58] quick to just hold on to being part of
[1:36:00] the group you know I had another dream I
[1:36:02] wasn't going to tell it but I'll tell it
[1:36:04] I was at a youth camp but it wasn't a
[1:36:05] youth camp but it was a youth camp
[1:36:06] wasn't you know and there were and then
[1:36:08] everyone was standing in a circle I was
[1:36:10] one of the Campers or a helper I don't
[1:36:11] know but I was there and and and
[1:36:13] everyone was standing in a big circle
[1:36:15] and brother Tim PR was preaching and he
[1:36:18] was preaching about how how we must
[1:36:20] receive our full inheritance amen we
[1:36:22] can't just be justified by faith or even
[1:36:25] just Sanctified but we've got to receive
[1:36:26] the fullness of the Holy Ghost more than
[1:36:28] anointed but God's going to come and
[1:36:29] dwell in your soul and change your life
[1:36:31] that's how you really see Jesus you get
[1:36:33] him on the inside you'll see him on the
[1:36:35] outside you'll see him in nature you'll
[1:36:36] see him everywhere but you got to get
[1:36:38] your full inheritance see Jesus died
[1:36:40] that he had dwell in you once again by
[1:36:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he'll
[1:36:43] change your nature that's your full
[1:36:44] inheritance cuz every promise lays in
[1:36:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's
[1:36:48] there but strange thing is is that
[1:36:49] everyone else wasn't really you know and
[1:36:51] he was saying who will come Stand By Me
[1:36:53] and receive their full inheritance and
[1:36:55] he had kind of cuz he' preach back and
[1:36:57] forth but the circle would move and
[1:36:58] there'd always be a gap between him and
[1:37:00] the campers so when he'd move this way
[1:37:02] the people the young people would move
[1:37:03] this way and we' move this way you know
[1:37:05] n none of them wanted to stand next to
[1:37:06] him and yeah and and I thought this is
[1:37:09] ridiculous I want my full inheritance
[1:37:11] you know so I went up to him and he had
[1:37:12] these like an armband it's just a
[1:37:14] representation just a teaching thing
[1:37:16] because you got to have a token right
[1:37:17] and the token is the Holy Ghost but you
[1:37:19] know but no one would come receive I
[1:37:20] said I want it
[1:37:22] and he and he and he put that band
[1:37:23] around my arm cuz I want my full
[1:37:25] inheritance right so I don't just want
[1:37:27] to be part of the group I want really
[1:37:29] Why We Gather amen and then and then
[1:37:31] there were all these young people there
[1:37:33] that playing all these instruments and
[1:37:34] there was and there was one particular
[1:37:37] person there W say who but but their but
[1:37:39] their instrument matched their outfit
[1:37:41] the color of their outfit was the color
[1:37:43] of their instrument and they're trying
[1:37:45] so hard to be noticed and I thought it's
[1:37:49] fine to want to be noticed but who do
[1:37:51] you want to notice you really shouldn't
[1:37:53] be our you know our faith saying Lord
[1:37:56] here I am Notice Me Lord this is why I'm
[1:37:59] here not to be part of the group not try
[1:38:00] and be popular but I want to be one with
[1:38:02] you Lord Jesus see but you see the thing
[1:38:05] is this is why we want to see Jesus we
[1:38:07] want our full inheritance amen that God
[1:38:09] would come and dwell in US you say I've
[1:38:11] been in the message for years some some
[1:38:13] people have been in the message for
[1:38:14] years but they don't know him see and
[1:38:16] this is the biggest danger we can be
[1:38:17] part of a group and just be blessed and
[1:38:19] have a happy time but not see him in our
[1:38:21] lives not see him change us amen not see
[1:38:24] him change our Natures that when we look
[1:38:26] back we say Lord you have made me more
[1:38:28] like you whatever I've been through Lord
[1:38:30] I'm more like you now than I was then
[1:38:32] sure I've had troubles and scars and
[1:38:33] hurts and pains but I've been I've been
[1:38:35] through things but Lord I'm more like
[1:38:37] you I'm more like your word Lord I see
[1:38:39] the fruits of the spirit I see a joy I
[1:38:41] see a teachable spirit see that's the
[1:38:44] big difference between the spirit of ear
[1:38:45] and the spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost
[1:38:47] is the spirit of Truth and if you really
[1:38:49] want to see him that Spirit of Truth
[1:38:51] truth will come into you and you'll be
[1:38:52] teachable to his word right see a person
[1:38:55] can have the spirit of error but they
[1:38:56] won't come subject to the word of God
[1:38:59] Amen but see this is should be our big
[1:39:01] desire Lord I want every promise you
[1:39:03] have for me amen I want to see you in
[1:39:06] every promise I don't just want to see
[1:39:07] you as being forgiven that's wonderful
[1:39:10] you we've all got to know that we're
[1:39:11] forgiven we've all got to know that his
[1:39:13] blood was shed for you and I it's not
[1:39:15] just a Sunday School Story it's not just
[1:39:17] an Easter season it's a reality amen
[1:39:20] with the blood of Jesus Christ becomes a
[1:39:22] reality amen so you see him there that's
[1:39:24] wonderful then you see him cleanse your
[1:39:25] life that's wonderful but Lord I want to
[1:39:27] see you more than that I want to see you
[1:39:29] living my life Lord that my nature is
[1:39:31] not my natural family nature sure we
[1:39:33] have a temperament we have a certain
[1:39:35] nature about us that God doesn't
[1:39:37] necessarily change but we want to be
[1:39:39] different to our family strain we want
[1:39:41] to be different Amen to to to our
[1:39:44] sisters or to our brothers maybe who are
[1:39:46] unsaved whatever Lord change our nature
[1:39:48] that it matches your nature Lord Lord I
[1:39:50] want you so much on the inside you know
[1:39:52] like brother Bram tells a story of that
[1:39:54] boy who was at Sunday school and I trust
[1:39:55] our kids are like this he goes to a he
[1:39:58] just had his eye I want to see God so he
[1:40:00] goes to his mother mama I want to see
[1:40:02] Jesus and she just maybe Wasing dishes
[1:40:05] feels embarrassed doesn't know how to
[1:40:06] answer the question CU you know some
[1:40:09] questions can be real curveballs from
[1:40:10] our par our children but they should
[1:40:12] never be right they should don't don't
[1:40:14] be afraid to answer anything give them
[1:40:16] the right answer but you know the right
[1:40:18] age appropriateness but don't be afraid
[1:40:21] anyway maybe she was scrubbing dishes
[1:40:23] but you she said well ask your Sunday
[1:40:24] school teacher Tred to just pass the
[1:40:27] question away and you know so so he goes
[1:40:29] to a Sunday school teacher I want to see
[1:40:32] Jesus and then the Sunday school teacher
[1:40:34] says oh go ask the pastor about
[1:40:37] that goes to the pastor oh I want to see
[1:40:40] Jesus and maybe the pastor says well you
[1:40:42] just believe by faith and he's around
[1:40:44] you and you know but there's no reality
[1:40:45] to it but then he's out fishing with an
[1:40:48] old man and and and and and there was
[1:40:51] rain in it cleared and there was a

[1:43:11] have Revival anymore we're in 2024 you
[1:43:14] know God only was here when the prophet
[1:43:16] was here the pillar of fire isn't here
[1:43:18] anymore those things are lies that's
[1:43:20] right
[1:43:21] oh you can't really have a book of Acts
[1:43:23] experience that's a lie oh you can't you
[1:43:25] just got to work through your problem
[1:43:26] that eventually you'll get over it no
[1:43:28] God can deliver like this amen sure
[1:43:31] there's counseling and things but the
[1:43:32] conclusion of counseling should be
[1:43:34] prayer and God coming down and sitting
[1:43:35] the setting someone free oh no no God
[1:43:39] doesn't do that anymore derer is a thing
[1:43:41] you know God you know we just yeah yeah
[1:43:43] brother Braham yeah God was there but
[1:43:44] he's not here anymore you know what that
[1:43:46] is brother brah Likens it to a
[1:43:49] beaver we don't have beavers in this
[1:43:51] country but beavers build dams right
[1:43:54] they will cut down certain trees and
[1:43:56] logs and it's very methodical they know
[1:43:58] what they're doing they'll cut down
[1:44:00] certain trees certain saplings different
[1:44:01] things and they'll try and they'll try
[1:44:03] and Dam a a creek or a river whatever it
[1:44:06] is cuz they want to live in that damn
[1:44:08] and you see this is what the enemy will
[1:44:10] try and do is he'll he'll try and cut
[1:44:12] down hurts and pains and resentment and
[1:44:16] misunderstandings and you'll try and get
[1:44:18] that to come into your life and build a
[1:44:20] dam yeah that we come into because a
[1:44:22] beaver builds a dam because it's a place
[1:44:24] of safety it's a place of protection
[1:44:27] it's a safe place in the Beaver Dam
[1:44:29] Predators can't get in there the
[1:44:31] elements can't get in it's safe and the
[1:44:33] devil wants us to get into a place where
[1:44:35] we just live in a safety zone like
[1:44:36] Brother Andy was preaching about right
[1:44:38] but you see now we can't let the devil
[1:44:41] make us into a dam where we can't see
[1:44:44] Jesus amen well we've got to be willing
[1:44:47] to say Lord cut all those things out of
[1:44:50] my life
[1:44:51] Lord am me because we don't have we
[1:44:53] don't have Beaver preachers
[1:44:56] today that build up dams and say You'
[1:44:58] going to live with that problem that's
[1:44:59] just how things have got to be and you
[1:45:01] know the waters can't flow anymore God
[1:45:03] doesn't live that way anymore you see
[1:45:05] because if anyone does that to you
[1:45:07] they're like the scribes and Pharisees
[1:45:08] saying basically you can't see Jesus you
[1:45:11] can't experience him the same his word
[1:45:13] isn't true anymore that's a beaver
[1:45:15] that's a beaver now in some environments
[1:45:18] they're reintroducing beavers C the
[1:45:20] environment needs it but spiritually we
[1:45:22] don't need beavers we don't need Beaver
[1:45:24] spirits to come in they've going to be
[1:45:25] blown out of the water you to blow up a
[1:45:27] damn amen because remember beavers don't
[1:45:29] make dams by accident they are
[1:45:31] methodical and so the enemy will search
[1:45:34] for logs of unforgiveness
[1:45:35] misunderstanding resentment anxiety fear
[1:45:37] disappointment selfish motives and
[1:45:39] they'll try and build a damn in your
[1:45:40] spirit that you can't see Jesus anymore
[1:45:43] but I tell you friends God is here to
[1:45:45] bust every Beaver Dam am mean he's here
[1:45:48] there is still a bom and Gilead amen we
[1:45:51] can still Touch the Hem of His Garment
