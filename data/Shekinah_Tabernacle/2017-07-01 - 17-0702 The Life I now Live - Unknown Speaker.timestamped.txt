[0:01] [Music]
[0:13] good morning
[0:15] all very welcome in the uh in the house
[0:19] of the Lord
[0:22] um this morning I just want to share a
[0:25] quick um it's not a testimony but um
[0:28] I've listened to a a few messages now on
[0:30] the train and back with uh all the
[0:32] interviews in town and and the one that
[0:35] stuck with me was
[0:36] um uh brother Chad made a reference to
[0:40] um uh brother brandom's thirst sermon
[0:44] and the the definition of thirst struck
[0:48] me and I just want to read that um as as
[0:52] a definition it's it's have a strong
[0:54] desire for something but then it goes on
[0:57] and saying it's a crave it's a want it's
[0:59] a cover it it's a desire a
[1:03] hunger um for after a lust almost it's a
[1:08] very strong it's a yearn and um I think
[1:12] if I'm not mistaken the quote that or
[1:14] the definition that brother brandham
[1:16] used was a painful desire to have a
[1:20] thirst
[1:23] now we we are after this we are we are
[1:27] wanting this and that's why we're here
[1:29] today to day cuz there's no other place
[1:33] out from this that we can go and receive
[1:36] this we I can not go and receive this
[1:39] any any place in the world and I want to
[1:43] tie that into a little story when we had
[1:46] our trip in South Africa I had the big
[1:49] privilege of having kidney stones while
[1:50] we were there
[1:53] and but you get there and it's all this
[1:56] you know oh I long I crave I yearn for
[2:00] you know the taste of their Coca-Cola
[2:02] the taste of Tropa Tropa was this little
[2:05] creamy milky thing yogis Everything
[2:08] Everything but water so I was just
[2:11] drinking and now all of a sudden the
[2:13] climate's changed and I you know you
[2:16] pirate more and it's you have to drink
[2:19] more water but I did all the substitutes
[2:23] and yes you can go and have that outside
[2:26] there there will be a substitute for
[2:28] water there will be a substitute for
[2:30] this and and quenching your thirst but
[2:32] you will never get quenched and I it
[2:35] just struck me that the the the word the
[2:38] painful desire um and I think the
[2:41] reference he used brother brandham was a
[2:43] deer that got hurt um he he had
[2:48] immediate thirst and a his sole mission
[2:51] on Earth for that moment was to get to a
[2:54] uh a brook to go and drink water and
[2:58] that's that's all that was and please
[3:01] have that desire this morning to just
[3:03] come here and come and quench your
[3:05] thirst just come and um come and rest
[3:08] here at the brook come and relax and and
[3:12] and and and enjoy God's atmosphere that
[3:16] he uh that he provides us I'll open in
[3:18] prayer and and we can start and uh like
[3:22] like Brother Andy always said come and
[3:23] spend your energy I just want to say
[3:25] come and come and rest so that the Holy
[3:28] Spirit can come and come and work under
[3:31] us and we can enter that
[3:33] atmosphere good morning Lord and thank
[3:36] you for a wonderful privilege that we
[3:38] can be here today that we can come and
[3:41] find a a place where we can quench our
[3:44] thirst that we can have a wonderful pure
[3:48] Fellowship around your word and and the
[3:52] word in season today that's being
[3:54] brought I want to come and bless brother
[3:56] Ben that's uh that's prepared this and

[4:21] of this premises Lord that there's
[4:24] there's a difference and there's a a

[33:55] shall be also in the likeness of his
[33:57] resurrection
[33:58] knowing this that our old man is
[34:00] crucified with him that the body of sin
[34:02] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[34:04] should not uh we should not serve sin
[34:06] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[34:08] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[34:11] we should also live with him knowing
[34:13] that Christ being raised from the dead
[34:15] dieth no more death hath no more
[34:17] dominion over him for in that he died he
[34:20] died under sin once but in that he
[34:22] liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[34:26] reckon ye also yourself to be dead
[34:28] indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[34:32] through Jesus Christ Our
[34:35] Lord amen and now let's go to Galatians
[34:38] and and uh chapter
[34:44] 2 we're going to read verse 16 down to
[34:47] verse
[34:51] 19 Galatians 2:6
[34:59] knowing that a man is not justified by
[35:01] The Works of the law but by the faith of
[35:04] Jesus Christ even we have believed in
[35:06] Jesus Christ that we might be justified
[35:08] by the Faith of Christ and not by The
[35:11] Works of the law for by The Works of the
[35:13] law shall no man no flesh be justified
[35:16] but if while ye seek to be justified by
[35:19] Christ ye ourselves also found Sinners
[35:22] is there in um is therefore Christ the
[35:24] minister of sin God forbid for if I
[35:27] build
[35:28] again uh the things which I destroyed I
[35:31] make myself a transgressor for through
[35:34] the
[35:36] law for through the law um am dead to
[35:40] the law that I might live unto God now
[35:43] this really I want to get to verse 20
[35:45] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[35:48] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[35:51] and the life which I now live in the
[35:53] flesh I live by the faith of the son of
[35:57] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[36:02] amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[36:04] you may have your
[36:06] seats so if I could take a um if I could
[36:09] take a
[36:10] subject I want to I want to take the
[36:13] there in verse 20 the life which I now
[36:17] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[36:21] the Son of God so the Apostle Paul he
[36:25] knew what he was talking about you know
[36:28] when he would write to the when he was
[36:30] inspired by the Lord to write to the uh
[36:33] the Epistles you know all of them you
[36:35] know and and what we just read to the
[36:37] Romans and to the Galatians you know he
[36:39] was not just writing from a theological
[36:41] viewpoint but he had a real experience
[36:44] where once his life was governed by his
[36:47] own human Faith amen he was he was a
[36:51] Pharisee of the Pharisees you know he
[36:53] was he was raised under the greatest
[36:55] teacher of the time Gia who who who knew
[36:58] the scriptures backwards and forwards
[37:00] and you know he was a very learned man
[37:02] but yet the life that he lived was a
[37:04] very different life to the life he began
[37:07] to live when he met the Lord on the road
[37:08] to Damascus right amen so he was more
[37:12] than just you know to to him it was more
[37:14] than just changing a mindset or swapping
[37:17] a collection of doctrines for a new one
[37:20] amen it was more than just forsaking you
[37:22] know the the the religion of the
[37:24] Pharisees and walking in a you know a
[37:27] new understanding but it was it was he
[37:30] met the very author that wrote the Old
[37:33] Testament I mean he wrote The Very God
[37:35] that that wrote the Bible through Moses
[37:37] and through the prophets and he began to
[37:39] see that it was more than just Doctrine
[37:42] or a way of life but it was a life amen
[37:45] it was because he says the life I now
[37:48] live so the life that he was living
[37:50] after he met the Lord on the road to
[37:51] Damascus was a very different kind of
[37:54] life not just because he changed his
[37:56] beliefs but because eternal life had
[37:59] come into him am mean so he's now living
[38:01] not by a natural life that would perish
[38:03] but he was living by an eternal life the
[38:05] very God that created heavens and earth
[38:07] came and dwelt in him and that was the
[38:09] life that was living out of him amen
[38:12] because he he said now reckon yourselves
[38:14] dead amen likewise reckon ye also
[38:17] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[38:19] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[38:22] Our Lord so you have to reckon Yourself
[38:25] Dead amen that the old you has been dead
[38:28] it's been buried hallelujah amen that
[38:30] that old life Jesus Took up Calvary that
[38:33] day it's been nailed to a cross amen
[38:35] it's been done away with that the
[38:37] believer does not have to live by their
[38:39] first nature their first natural life
[38:41] that will perish but the believer now
[38:44] lives and operates by the life of God
[38:46] himself Hallelujah because he says now
[38:49] it's very important when we read there
[38:51] in Galatians 2 and 20 he says the life
[38:54] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[38:57] the faith of the Son of God he doesn't
[38:59] he does not say that he lives this life
[39:03] in uh with faith in the Son of God but
[39:06] by the faith of the Son of God it's a
[39:08] very different thing even though it's
[39:10] just a change of a you know change of a
[39:12] word but to live by the faith of the Son
[39:15] of God is that same Faith or that same
[39:18] life that was in Jesus Christ the man
[39:20] now came into Paul himself so the very
[39:23] life that was being lived out of Paul
[39:25] wasn't his own life anymore but it was
[39:27] the life of Jesus Christ himself and
[39:30] it's the same thing with every believer
[39:33] the life we now live I trust you can
[39:35] actually say Paul I've had the same kind
[39:37] of experience amen where you can see the
[39:39] life I now live every day amen I live by
[39:42] the faith of the Son of God Amen to that
[39:45] Faith because faith is a revelation amen
[39:49] Faith real faith is a revelation amen it
[39:52] is not something you can learn it's not
[39:54] something you can earn but it's revealed
[39:56] to you sovereignly by Jesus Christ
[39:58] himself Hallelujah so it's a revelation
[40:01] and when God Reveals His word to you you
[40:05] can't you can't forget it you can't
[40:07] change your mind about it it becomes a
[40:08] very part of you amen it becomes a very
[40:11] part of your being and you cannot deny
[40:14] it no more than you could deny
[40:16] yourself Hallelujah so Paul began to
[40:18] operate in a very different way he was a
[40:20] Pharisee but then he became into his
[40:23] real position as a Son of God Amen and
[40:26] he recognized he was the Son of God he
[40:28] wasn't afraid to say I have been birthed
[40:32] amen I've been born again amen I'm a new
[40:35] creature in Christ all things have
[40:37] passed away and all things have be all
[40:39] things have passed away and all things
[40:40] have became new he wasn't afraid to
[40:42] recognize who he was and it's the same
[40:44] thing with you and I friends we can't
[40:46] just sit back and say well I'm just a
[40:49] sinner saved by grace we are sinners
[40:51] saved by grace absolutely no man could
[40:53] save himself you couldn't save yourself
[40:56] you know man is tried to reform himself
[40:58] for thousands of years and if everyone
[41:01] failed I mean every self-help book could
[41:03] never get to the core root of unbelief
[41:05] and cast that out because we understand
[41:08] that sin the attributes of sin of what
[41:10] you see around us in Civilization today
[41:13] are you following me amen and all the
[41:15] self-help books in the world cannot undo
[41:17] that unbelief that causes people Amen to
[41:20] live in a in a way that they hate
[41:21] themselves and they can't even you know
[41:23] have peace with their own selves that's
[41:25] right amen are you with me amen amen
[41:27] when God comes upon the sea Hallelujah
[41:30] he gives you a new nature and then you
[41:31] can even have peace with yourself amen
[41:34] instead of looking in the mirror and
[41:35] saying I hate this guy and I hate how he
[41:37] does and I hate his personality amen a
[41:40] new life comes into you and you make
[41:43] peace Hallelujah not just with God but
[41:45] with yourself amen because you begin to
[41:48] recognize God made me a certain way amen
[41:51] and in our humanity and in our little
[41:53] quirks and our in you know intentes or
[41:55] whatever you call it you know God God
[41:57] made us this way yeah I mean God God
[41:59] caused people to you know move from one
[42:02] part of the world to another part of the
[42:03] world to marry a certain person to bring
[42:05] forth a certain characteristic and down
[42:08] and down and down in certain cultures
[42:09] and certain places God was molding you
[42:12] thank you Lord God was bringing you
[42:14] forth amen because you know Abraham Paul
[42:17] says in the book of Hebrews that Levi
[42:20] was in Abraham when Abraham paid TI to
[42:22] mesed he wasn't saying figuratively
[42:25] saying literally Levi was in him
[42:28] amen so the experiences and that was
[42:30] attributed to Levi yes amen so all the
[42:32] things that Abraham did amen affected
[42:35] Levi in some way amen and that's just a
[42:37] natural lineage right Hallelujah you got
[42:39] to think of a supernatural lineage I
[42:42] mean cuz it's not a not a nation you
[42:44] come from which means you're the bride
[42:45] of Christ or your your parents or
[42:48] whatever you're the Wim blo where it
[42:50] listed you don't know where it comes
[42:52] from don't know where it goes so does
[42:54] everyone's born by the spirit of God God
[42:56] just blows into a place Hallelujah the
[42:59] word just comes into a place then you
[43:01] find yourself in a very different kind
[43:03] of way
[43:05] hallelujah amen so now that's why we
[43:08] should just Rejoice you know we can't
[43:10] shrink back we are sinners saved by
[43:13] grace but Esther yeah you look at Queen
[43:15] Esther I know I've said it before but
[43:17] she was placed as Queen she didn't make
[43:20] herself Queen amen she was just obedient
[43:22] to the word of Hagi cuz Hagi knew the
[43:24] heart of the king that's right amen she
[43:26] didn't think of how how how can I please
[43:28] the king to marry marry the king of this
[43:31] great Empire he just she just knew this
[43:33] man knows his heart I'm going to listen
[43:36] to him how should I dress how should I
[43:38] conduct myself what should I do hag I
[43:41] said do this amen and she said I'll do
[43:43] it Hallelujah and then she found herself
[43:46] with a crown on her head amen but
[43:49] remember her first nature was she was a
[43:51] Jew we all know this but but the Jews
[43:55] have never been liked they've never been
[43:57] liked doesn't matter you go through
[43:59] their history they've been persecuted
[44:01] they've been kicked out of countries
[44:03] they've been killed all systematically
[44:05] tried to be wiped out you know they've
[44:07] never been liked so her her first her
[44:10] her first birth her first identity was
[44:14] not even liked in that Empire you with
[44:16] me she couldn't even use morai said
[44:19] don't go by your Jewish name hadassa go
[44:22] by you know the Gentile Persian name
[44:24] Esther so she had to deny her even the
[44:27] name she was
[44:28] given here she is so she's got a dilemma
[44:32] going on and then now here comes the
[44:34] great crunch
[44:36] time the enemy is signed put it into had
[44:39] had the king to sign a death warrant for
[44:41] your whole race state state sanctu
[44:45] genocide amen here it is and the and and
[44:48] there's Jews in the promised land trying
[44:50] to rebuild the Temple at this time and
[44:52] it's been put into law all the Jews must
[44:54] be killed on the 13th day the 12th month
[44:57] or whenever it was and here's the one
[44:59] woman in a position one believer in a
[45:02] position Hallelujah and she can do
[45:04] something about it amen the other ones
[45:07] could maybe try and arm themselves and
[45:08] say how are we're going to figure this
[45:09] out but here's this here's this one
[45:11] woman Hallelujah and she's married to
[45:14] the king she finds herself in the right
[45:16] place at the right time and Mori just
[45:19] throws it out there perhaps youve come
[45:21] into the kingdom for a Time such as this
[45:23] you with me and then so God really
[45:25] throws it out to you even today perhaps
[45:27] you've come into the kingdom amen amen
[45:30] perhaps you've come into the kingdom
[45:32] that your family will come in amen that
[45:34] your loved ones will be saved
[45:37] Deliverance will come to your house
[45:39] perhaps you've come to a kingdom for a
[45:40] Time such as just throwing it out there
[45:42] am me I've been thinking very you know
[45:44] I've been listening to you know uh
[45:47] Melanie sing the song take me into the
[45:49] holy of holies there's a line in that
[45:52] song Here I Am take the cold yes here I

[46:29] up in the temple he's a prophet he knows
[46:32] what it's like to go into the temple but
[46:33] something's very different now am mean
[46:36] the influence of the King has died
[46:37] because King Uzziah died and he was
[46:39] leaning very heavily on the shoulder of
[46:41] that King CU he admired him so much but
[46:44] it says in the year that King Uzziah
[46:46] died I saw the Lord high and lifted up
[46:47] he went into the temple was in distress
[46:50] Hallelujah then he sees the Cher of the
[46:53] serams in the place
[46:55] shaking he says I'm undone I'm an
[46:58] unclean man living amongst unclean
[47:00] people he's a prophet recognizes that
[47:03] he's lost and undone when he's in the
[47:04] presence of God am me then the then the
[47:07] Angel takes the call touches his lips
[47:09] your sin has been purged and then the
[47:12] call Goes Forth who go for us am mean

[47:20] it amen you go speak to that person you
[47:23] go pray Hallelujah you use that burden
[47:25] channel that burden thank you Lord hey
[47:27] it's a blessing to have a burden
[47:29] blessing to have a burden for family

[48:03] service and he said you go listen to the
[48:05] prayer lines there's not one person that
[48:09] the heart of the of the persons
[48:10] discerned by the spirit of the Lord and
[48:12] the prophet saying you want to see a
[48:14] Rapture you want to see a body change
[48:16] there's not one and that should be our
[48:19] really deep down we come with you know
[48:21] we have our burdens we have our
[48:23] questions we have our you know our needs
[48:26] and our things want to see answered in
[48:27] prayer but the thing that should really
[48:29] be down the core of us amen you want to
[48:33] see a resurrection amen amen you want to
[48:36] see it change in the body you want to
[48:38] see your body come young again am mean
[48:40] you want to see the dead in Christ rise
[48:43] amen you want to be caught up to meet
[48:44] the Lord in the air Hallelujah this

[49:04] humanly it got more impossible it was
[49:06] already impossible to begin with but it

[49:52] just trying to excite you and make you
[49:54] all excited no I'm not Faith we're
[49:57] called to believe all things are
[49:58] possible all things are possible to them
[50:01] that believe that's what we're called
[50:03] and we're not called to look at what we
[50:05] think we are or our state or our track
[50:09] record or our history forget it that's
[50:11] right Paul said forgetting the things
[50:13] that true in the past what does that
[50:15] mean forget it what happened in the past
[50:17] I don't remember amen I'm pressing to

[50:21] we should do press the mark of the High

[50:37] destroy amen that could have been a big
[50:39] Guilt
[50:40] Trip amen he said but he said but by the
[50:43] grace of God I am what I
[50:45] am Hallelujah so don't worry about what

[50:56] yes that's what you've got to do you got
[50:58] to keep
[50:59] walking
[51:02] now sorry now
[51:06] Paul when he met the Lord on the road to
[51:09] Damascus he says in a um he says in
[51:12] Galatians 1 and verse
[51:15] 11 let's just read this
[51:17] together Galatians 1:11 down to verse
[51:21] 19 he says but I certify you Brethren
[51:25] that the gospel which was preached of me
[51:27] is not after man for I neither received
[51:30] it of man neither was I taught it but by
[51:34] the revelation of Jesus Christ for ye
[51:36] have heard of my
[51:39] conversation uh in times past in the
[51:41] Jews religion how that beyond measure I
[51:44] persecuted the Church of God and wasted
[51:46] it and profited in the Jews religion uh
[51:51] above many my equals in my own
[51:54] Nation uh being more exceedingly jealous
[51:57] of the traditions of my father but when
[52:00] it pleased God hallelujah who separated
[52:03] me from my mother's womb and called me
[52:06] by his grace to reveal his son in me
[52:09] that I may preach him uh among the
[52:11] Heathen immediately I conferred not with
[52:13] flesh and blood neither went I up to the
[52:16] uh to Jerusalem to them which were
[52:18] Apostles before me but I went into
[52:21] Arabia and returned again unto Damascus
[52:24] then after 3 years I went up to to
[52:27] Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with
[52:30] him 15 days but the other Apostles saw I
[52:33] None save James the Lord's brother so he
[52:37] had an experience he met this pillar of
[52:39] light on the road to
[52:41] Damascus and then you know he was
[52:43] blinded he you know he went into
[52:45] Damascus he went to the street called
[52:47] straight amen then then ananas came and
[52:50] prayed for he received his side he was
[52:51] baptized received the Holy Ghost but
[52:53] after all this he spent he went down
[52:56] into Arabia for 3 years and he searched
[52:59] the Old Testament to see who was this
[53:02] one he met amen he began to search it
[53:05] out so he had a life-changing experience
[53:08] but then he searched in the scripture
[53:10] you know who who is this one and he
[53:13] began to see that Jehovah of the Old
[53:15] Testament Hallelujah the very God that
[53:18] said let there be light the very God
[53:20] that spoke to Abraham get you out of
[53:21] this country I'll give you another
[53:23] country I mean the same God that came
[53:25] and spoke to Moses out of a burning bush
[53:28] amen I've come down I've heard the cries
[53:30] of my people I've come down to deliver
[53:32] them the same one that spoke to Isaiah
[53:34] Jeremiah and all the prophets down he
[53:36] was the same one that that that Paul met
[53:38] on the road to Damascus and he began to
[53:40] see his experience matched the Bible and
[53:42] he began to see that truly Jesus Christ
[53:45] he was wounded for our transgression
[53:47] amen the chastisement our peace was upon
[53:48] him and by his stripes we were healed
[53:50] amen he saw that God there's no other
[53:53] savior God says in the book of Isaiah I
[53:55] am the only savior there's none beside
[53:58] me amen and then in the New Testament
[54:00] who's who who's who's the Savior Jesus
[54:02] Christ there's not two different gods
[54:04] there one God manifesting himself in
[54:06] different ways amen hallelujah he begin
[54:09] to see that his experience match God's
[54:11] Bible That's Right
[54:14] Hallelujah and I trust this is actually
[54:17] your experience amen when you begin to
[54:19] see this God you have met how many years
[54:23] ago I don't know could be this morning I
[54:25] pray it is if you haven't I me but you
[54:27] begin to see as you look into his word
[54:29] hallelujah that that that that same God
[54:32] that we that we enjoy and we love and we
[54:34] rejoice in this message that we have
[54:36] received amen it is God himself
[54:39] declaring
[54:40] himself Hallelujah I because that's what
[54:42] Paul
[54:43] saw he didn't just take it take an
[54:46] experience and run with it he he went
[54:48] into here and he read and he read three
[54:51] years remember he knew the scripture
[54:53] from a little child he probably could
[54:55] have quoted it standing right there on
[54:56] the road to Damascus from Genesis
[54:58] through to Malachi but he searched it in
[55:01] the Bible who's this one I met who's
[55:03] this pillar of light who says my name is
[55:06] Jesus Hallelujah that's right I trust
[55:09] it's the same thing with you will you go
[55:11] into the word and you begin to see your
[55:13] life amen you begin to see the life that
[55:16] lives out of you is in the scripture
[55:18] amen where Paul would speak about the
[55:20] fruits of the
[55:21] spirit amen and he and he and he says in
[55:24] Galatians 5 let's just do a bit of
[55:26] reading today if this is okay Galatians
[55:29] 5:16 that's incredible here you are God
[55:33] meets you and then you look into his
[55:35] Bible and you begin to see the life
[55:37] that's now manifesting out of you it's a
[55:40] very different life that it was before
[55:42] and you see it in the word hallelujah so
[55:45] what Paul writes on paper is manifested
[55:48] in you Hallelujah that's an incredible
[55:51] thing cuz no man you know can you can't
[55:54] manufacture you can try people can try
[55:56] and manufacture the life of God but when
[55:59] it really comes into someone that's
[56:01] right you with me I trust it means
[56:03] something to you amen amen Galatians
[56:05] 5:16 this I say then walk in the spirit
[56:09] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[56:11] flesh for the flesh lust us against the
[56:14] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[56:16] and these are contrary one to another so
[56:19] uh ye cannot do the things that you
[56:21] would but if you would be led of the
[56:24] spirit you're not under the law Glory
[56:27] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[56:29] which are these adultery fornication
[56:31] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[56:34] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[56:37] wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings
[56:40] murders drunkenness rings and such like
[56:43] of which I tell you before as I've told
[56:46] you in the past that they which do such
[56:48] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[56:50] God but the fruit of the spirit is love
[56:53] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[56:55] goodness faith meekness Temperance
[56:57] against such there's no law and they
[56:59] that are in Christ have crucified the
[57:01] flesh with the affections and lusts and
[57:05] if you walk in the spirit let us I mean
[57:07] if you live in the spirit let us also
[57:09] walk in the spirit let us not be desires
[57:12] of vain Glory uh provoking one another
[57:16] envying one
[57:17] another Hallelujah so I trust you can
[57:20] you can read when Paul is describing a
[57:22] Believer and you can actually say that's
[57:25] me amen amen and it's not my own human
[57:28] ability that does it it's a very
[57:30] different it's the spirit of God it's
[57:32] not me it's not me that liveth but
[57:34] Christ that liveth in me Hallelujah I
[57:37] trust you can say that's me he's writing
[57:40] about me he's talking about me he's
[57:42] describing me Hallelujah it should be
[57:45] that way that's right amen James 3 and10
[57:48] down to verse 12 we're just going to do
[57:49] a bit of I love reading the Bible amen
[57:52] hallelujah these things are glorious
[57:55] amen because you say well I'm not
[57:58] matching up with then you just say Lord
[58:00] change me so I do match up it's not
[58:02] remember this is not a Reformation amen
[58:05] this is not a self-help seven steps to
[58:07] becoming a Christian there's you know it
[58:09] is a transformation by his spirit it's
[58:12] when you yield your will that you what
[58:14] is the prayer the model prayer Our
[58:17] Father which are in heaven Hallelujah

[58:42] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[58:44] thine is the power and the glory forever
[58:46] and ever amen that's the model prayer
[58:49] thy will Hallelujah after praising his
[58:52] name how great he is Father you're
[58:54] glorious amen Hallowed be thy name thy
[58:56] will be done not my will amen and we'll
[58:59] come into it later in the service I'm
[59:00] going to take a bit of a segue I'll just
[59:02] drop it in now there's power there's
[59:04] great power and humility there's
[59:07] incredible power and humility Hallelujah
[59:09] and if you want to stay on the narrow
[59:11] way humility will keep you there amen

[59:47] other but if you are the one you can
[59:50] become the other amen amen remember

[1:00:42] but Jesus Christ Allelujah gives you a
[1:00:45] new nature gives you a new birth gives

[1:02:27] just consent but he says now goes to the
[1:02:29] high
[1:02:31] priest so he sees the life of God on
[1:02:33] display this is what I'm trying to say

[1:02:36] manifesting in a man and then he says

[1:02:41] out we've all made
[1:02:44] mistakes amen we've all stepped off the
[1:02:46] path at one time that didn't hold back

[1:06:08] is a different burial Hallelujah Lazarus

[1:06:20] be made fun of he knows what it's like
[1:06:21] to be
[1:06:22] misunderstood amen you think of him as a
[1:06:25] 10-year-old boy they go to Jerusalem for
[1:06:27] the feast he doesn't look at all the
[1:06:29] stuff that 10-year-old boys what would
[1:06:31] they want to see I want to go see the
[1:06:32] Roman soldiers I want to go see the big
[1:06:35] castles and you know you want to see
[1:06:36] cool stuff where does he go he goes to
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:39] temple amen I know I've said these
[1:06:41] things before but you I trusted sink in
[1:06:43] he he goes to the temple he opens up the
[1:06:46] Bible and he begins to talk scripture
[1:06:47] with the priests 10 years old that's not
[1:06:50] a normal kind of 10-year-old that's
[1:06:52] right normal 10-year-old want to go play
[1:06:54] and do things and you know you want to
[1:06:56] be no but he was remember he was the
[1:06:57] word made
[1:06:59] flesh and so if that was how he was
[1:07:01] there he would have been that kind of
[1:07:03] way in the village and you know the kid
[1:07:05] that's always a bit different let's play
[1:07:07] run away from who whoever his name is
[1:07:09] that's right amen and sometimes you're
[1:07:11] on the receiving end of that game
[1:07:13] sometimes you're the ones playing the
[1:07:16] game amen he knew what it was
[1:07:20] like he knew what it was like to be
[1:07:22] rejected because he understand so he
[1:07:24] went through all that to understand your
[1:07:25] human weakness yeah I'm glad yes am amen
[1:07:31] but I want my experience to match God's
[1:07:33] Bible now he says in the same sermon
[1:07:37] like I said the other day the birth is a
[1:07:39] mess I don't care where you go if it's
[1:07:42] if it's um if it's in a pig pen it's a
[1:07:44] mess speak of a birth if it's in a Hast
[1:07:45] stack it's a mess or if it's in a pink
[1:07:48] decorated hospital room it's still a
[1:07:49] mess any kind of a birth and the new
[1:07:52] birth of the uh is a mess too it'll make
[1:07:56] a mess out of you but you'll certainly
[1:07:58] get new life and be a new creature when
[1:08:00] you receive it it'll make you do things
[1:08:02] that you wouldn't think you do yes sir
[1:08:04] it would make you get down there on the
[1:08:06] altar ball and cry and beat and confess
[1:08:08] all your sins it'll make you a different
[1:08:10] person out of you and then after that
[1:08:12] it'll make you act ridiculous to what
[1:08:14] you used to act why you know when people
[1:08:17] gets right with God never meets God
[1:08:19] anywhere they act ridiculous to what the
[1:08:22] old life
[1:08:23] was amen many of us wouldn't be I one
[1:08:26] would not be in this
[1:08:28] place amen and that is acting ridiculous
[1:08:31] to what I once was I'm glad for a new
[1:08:34] life Paul said the life I once lived and
[1:08:37] the life I now live it's a different one
[1:08:39] than the one he did live at one time
[1:08:41] look at Moses when he met God he was
[1:08:44] just with had all kinds of theology he
[1:08:46] was just as full as much as Carter has
[1:08:49] keys and I don't know what that means
[1:08:50] but what happened when he met God he was
[1:08:53] afraid to go in Egypt but the next
[1:08:54] morning we find him with his wife
[1:08:56] sitting uh straddle straddle a mule with
[1:08:59] a young on her hip bed hanging down
[1:09:02] about like this an old crooked stick in
[1:09:04] his hand just praising God going down to
[1:09:07] Egypt wasn't that ridiculous looking
[1:09:10] that's right he remember he had to flee
[1:09:12] the country cuz he killed an Egyptian he
[1:09:15] he fled now here he comes back as an
[1:09:16] 80-year old
[1:09:18] man that certainly looks ridiculous now
[1:09:21] someone say Moses where you going father
[1:09:23] Moses Rabbi Moses where you going what's
[1:09:25] the matter with you boy Moses says going
[1:09:28] down to Egypt to take over going right
[1:09:30] down to take over a one-man Invasion
[1:09:33] just like one man going to take over
[1:09:35] Russia why it sounds ridiculous but he
[1:09:38] was just happy and that bald head is
[1:09:41] shining that hair blowing back over his
[1:09:43] whiskers going down to take over why God
[1:09:46] said so and the beauty part of it was he
[1:09:49] did it amen that's the that's what's the
[1:09:52] matter with the church nowadays we've
[1:09:53] got to let God take over
[1:09:55] and get all the other stuff take it out
[1:09:58] and let God get a hold of you amen
[1:10:01] hallelujah now God himself I'm going to
[1:10:04] read this
[1:10:05] but God himself became a man to prove
[1:10:08] that the faith his Faith Works amen his
[1:10:12] faith works and he says he says uh in
[1:10:16] the same message he says now why take
[1:10:18] all the knowledge you got your head out
[1:10:20] lay it over to one side let God come in
[1:10:22] your heart he'll make something out of
[1:10:24] you make you act different be different
[1:10:27] and your Associates will be different
[1:10:28] all your whole life will be different
[1:10:31] everything will be changed when God
[1:10:32] comes into your life that's as certain
[1:10:34] as I know about him it'll change your
[1:10:37] life now when God got ready to try out
[1:10:39] his toxin which is actually he's not
[1:10:41] talking about poison he's talking about
[1:10:42] a medicine okay did you notice he'd
[1:10:45] never put it in a guinea pig he put it
[1:10:47] in himself any good doctor tries out his
[1:10:50] own medicine on himself first now God
[1:10:52] took it upon himself when God was made
[1:10:55] flesh and dwelt Among Us and the life of
[1:10:57] Christ Jesus being his son and God was
[1:10:59] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:11:02] himself he took the toxin upon himself
[1:11:05] when he was baptized by John on the
[1:11:07] River Jordan John bear record seeing the
[1:11:10] spirit of God like a dove coming from
[1:11:11] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[1:11:14] whom I'm well pleased it went into him
[1:11:17] the disciples and all watched him to see
[1:11:19] what he would do they watched his life
[1:11:22] to see how he would act to see what
[1:11:24] would take place
[1:11:25] we find him like there when he was under
[1:11:28] Temptation the toxin held when he was in
[1:11:31] The Garden of Gethsemane toxin held when
[1:11:34] he was spit on in his face toxin held
[1:11:37] when they nailed him to the cross the
[1:11:39] toxin held it was good amen hallelujah
[1:11:42] he proved that the medicine works amen
[1:11:45] that the faith God's own faith in a
[1:11:49] man works it was good it helped am
[1:11:53] Hallelujah so we'll hold in the hard
[1:11:55] time times it will hold in the good
[1:11:57] times it will hold in the times where
[1:11:59] you don't know where you're going where
[1:12:00] there seems to be no way it will hold
[1:12:03] amen it was good I just like that phrase
[1:12:05] I bolded it it was good Hallelujah and
[1:12:08] it's still good amen so Paul he lived by
[1:12:12] the faith of the Son of God and every
[1:12:15] believer down on through lives by the
[1:12:18] faith of the Son of God Amen you got to
[1:12:21] you got to say yes that's me amen don't
[1:12:23] say no it's not me you going to say yes
[1:12:24] that's me and if you do not have the
[1:12:27] faith of the Son of God you say God
[1:12:28] change my life take my life and make it
[1:12:31] thine
[1:12:32] amen now King David or David he was a
[1:12:37] man after God's Own Heart God told
[1:12:40] Samuel that he was that he has a man
[1:12:42] after his own heart that he's going to
[1:12:43] be made
[1:12:45] King now let's go to Psalms 119 I want
[1:12:48] to
[1:12:50] read a few a few uh extracts from the
[1:12:53] from the Psalms because
[1:13:03] because
[1:13:05] David he was he was A Gifted
[1:13:09] Man but God took and everyone is has a
[1:13:13] gift of some
[1:13:15] way right now but David the reason one
[1:13:19] of the reasons he was a man after God's
[1:13:21] Own Heart is because the gift in his
[1:13:23] life was because he didn't want it for a
[1:13:26] selfish motive he didn't use it for his
[1:13:29] own personal gain amen and every true s
[1:13:33] surrendered man or woman the gift that
[1:13:36] God has placed in their life they do not
[1:13:38] want it for their own gain amen because
[1:13:41] a gift a gift of you know faith is a
[1:13:44] gift I mean you say well I'm not gifted
[1:13:46] if you believe you you're actually
[1:13:47] gifted because you got a gift of faith
[1:13:50] Hallelujah but that gift is not to
[1:13:52] express you that gift is to express
[1:13:55] Jesus Christ amen amen so when so when
[1:13:59] David is writing the Psalms he's not
[1:14:01] writing words that he just plucks out
[1:14:03] from his mind and writes a song cuz it
[1:14:05] sounds neat it's actually Christ taking
[1:14:07] that gift and expressing himself through
[1:14:09] that
[1:14:10] man
[1:14:12] Hallelujah now Psalms 119 and 105 down
[1:14:16] to
[1:14:19] 112
[1:14:21] now oh let's just read this now it says
[1:14:24] Thy Word as a lamp unto my feet and a
[1:14:27] light unto my path I have sworn and I'll
[1:14:30] perform it that I will keep thy
[1:14:31] righteous judgments I am Afflicted very
[1:14:35] much Quicken me now this phrase comes a
[1:14:38] lot in the Psalms Quicken me oh Lord
[1:14:41] according unto Thy word except I beseech
[1:14:44] Thee the Free Will offerings of my mouth
[1:14:47] oh Jud um oh Lord and teach me thy
[1:14:50] judgments my soul is continually in my
[1:14:53] hand yet I do not for forget thy law the
[1:14:56] wicked have laid a snare for me yet I
[1:14:58] have heard not from thy precepts thy
[1:15:00] testimonies I like this thy testimonies
[1:15:03] have I taken as inheritage forever for
[1:15:06] they are the rejoicing of my heart
[1:15:08] hallelujah amen I have inclined mine
[1:15:11] heart to perform thy statutes always
[1:15:14] even unto the
[1:15:16] end
[1:15:17] so now this was David's desire but it's
[1:15:22] also God's desire being manifested
[1:15:24] through
[1:15:25] right because he wants us to be
[1:15:27] quickened according to his word a
[1:15:29] quickened to be made is to be made alive
[1:15:32] right and so this is the
[1:15:34] desire of his heart now
[1:15:38] Quicken Quicken here it means to
[1:15:41] live um but it also means um but part of
[1:15:46] the word also means uh to
[1:15:49] show so it mean so well I'll just read
[1:15:51] the definition for live it it means to
[1:15:53] live it also means to nourish up
[1:15:56] preserve restore to life am mean so when
[1:16:00] it means Quicken me to your word or make
[1:16:02] me alive it's not Natural Life he's
[1:16:03] talking about he's talking about super
[1:16:05] eternal
[1:16:06] life
[1:16:08] Hallelujah
[1:16:11] now King David now I'm just going to
[1:16:14] read a few now this is just from the
[1:16:15] psalm Psalm 71 and2 we'll see how quick
[1:16:17] brother arand is to throw them up Psalm
[1:16:20] 71 and 20 he uses this Quicken us or

[1:16:29] verse verse 20 Psalms 71 and 20 thou
[1:16:33] which has showed me great and sore
[1:16:34] trouble shall Quicken me again and shall
[1:16:37] bring me up again from the depths of the
[1:16:39] earth Psalms
[1:16:41] 1818 so will not we go back from thee
[1:16:45] Quicken us and we will call upon thy
[1:16:48] name Psalms

[1:16:57] word Psalms

[1:17:03] vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way
[1:17:07] this is this is the heart of a Believer

[1:17:17] have longed after thy precepts Quicken
[1:17:20] me in thy righteousness Psalms
[1:17:23] 11988 Quicken me after thy loving
[1:17:26] kindness so shall I keep the testimony
[1:17:28] of thy
[1:17:29] mouth amen Psalms 119 and 149 hear my
[1:17:35] voice according unto thy loving kindness
[1:17:37] oh Lord Quicken me according to thy
[1:17:39] judgment Psalms
[1:17:42] 11954 plead my cause and Deliver Me
[1:17:45] Quicken me according to Thy word Psalms

[1:17:54] judgments Psalms 119 1559 quick uh
[1:17:58] consider how I love thy precepts Quicken
[1:18:00] me oh Lord according to thy loving
[1:18:02] kindness Psalms 143 and: 11 Quicken me
[1:18:07] oh lord for thy name's sake for thy
[1:18:09] righteousness sake bring my soul out of
[1:18:13] trouble now he's not just is not vain
[1:18:15] repetition this is his heart's cry
[1:18:17] Quicken me to Thy word because he
[1:18:20] understands even in his own human desire
[1:18:23] he cannot keep the word of God Amen now
[1:18:26] this is just under the blood of bulls
[1:18:27] and goats but he has a desire Quicken me
[1:18:29] to your word make make your Word Alive
[1:18:32] to me this is desire Amen in times of
[1:18:34] trouble Quicken me to your judgment
[1:18:37] Hallelujah and it should be the same
[1:18:39] thing this should be our heart amen
[1:18:42] Quicken us remember the life I now live
[1:18:44] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:18:47] Amen and the Son of God is his word
[1:18:51] right so it should be Quicken me make me
[1:18:53] alive to your
[1:18:55] word you following me this should be our
[1:18:57] heart's desire Lord make make your word
[1:19:00] a living reality Hallelujah don't just
[1:19:03] don't just let it sink in the into these
[1:19:05] however many inches of gray matter I
[1:19:07] have in here into my memory Quicken it
[1:19:09] down into my soul make it a part of me
[1:19:12] amen amen because how are you going to
[1:19:14] live unless you unless you're operating
[1:19:17] according to the word amen Paul remember
[1:19:21] Paul we read there in Galatians 3 years
[1:19:24] he went down to Arabia then he went to
[1:19:26] Jerusalem and then he speaks with Peter
[1:19:29] now Peter knew God after reality after
[1:19:33] walking with him you know in the days of
[1:19:35] his flesh then the Holy Spirit coming
[1:19:37] down upon him the Apostle Paul knew him
[1:19:39] by reality as well but could place it
[1:19:41] all in the scripture so when they were
[1:19:44] talking Peter would say something and
[1:19:46] then Paul would say oh that's written
[1:19:48] here and that's written here and that's
[1:19:50] written here and they begin to see that
[1:19:52] the same things they preaching they
[1:19:54] preaching the same thing because it was
[1:19:56] divine revelation amen hallelujah but
[1:20:00] Paul so they could see they were living
[1:20:03] by the the word the faith of the Son of
[1:20:05] God
[1:20:07] Amen so there should be a
[1:20:10] cry Quicken me to Thy word make it a
[1:20:13] living reality amen amen that's what it
[1:20:16] must be this word must become alive to
[1:20:18] us amen it can't just be excitement it
[1:20:21] can't just be what my family does it's
[1:20:23] got to become your own conviction that's
[1:20:25] right
[1:20:27] amen God is still looking for men and
[1:20:29] women boys and girls to express himself
[1:20:31] through he is searching for surrendered
[1:20:35] vessels people that do not have any
[1:20:38] interest in using the gift that God has
[1:20:40] given them for their own personal
[1:20:42] gain right now let's go to Numbers
[1:20:45] chapter
[1:20:51] 22 Paul could have become a very rich
[1:20:54] man
[1:20:55] he could have maybe become the next high
[1:20:58] priest he was there just like Moses he
[1:21:01] could have been the next Pharaoh he had
[1:21:04] half a foot on the throne of pharaoh I
[1:21:05] mean you know of Egypt he could have
[1:21:07] done it but he he forsook
[1:21:10] Egypt and followed Christ so he waited
[1:21:14] up remember so he waited up and he said
[1:21:17] I'd rather I'd rather follow this great
[1:21:21] Jehovah God that I just met into the
[1:21:23] desert through hardness and affliction
[1:21:25] and leading his people out to do his
[1:21:28] will then be the next Pharaoh am mean
[1:21:31] cuz he was living by the faith of God
[1:21:34] himself right and the same thing with
[1:21:36] Paul he could have probably been next
[1:21:38] been the next high priest he was a
[1:21:39] Pharisee of the fares he was the up and
[1:21:42] up here's this young man he's got so
[1:21:44] much potential look at what he could
[1:21:46] achieve but he met this the very God he
[1:21:49] was thinking he was worshiping he met so
[1:21:51] he forsook it all that he came to a
[1:21:53] place
[1:21:55] he writes to Timothy bring my I need my
[1:21:57] coat when you come bring my coat
[1:21:59] Winter's coming he had nothing he could
[1:22:02] have been a very rich man but here he
[1:22:04] was bring my coat why can't you get
[1:22:07] another one that's my coat I I can't
[1:22:09] afford another one he forsook all he
[1:22:11] could have just climbed the Ivory Tower
[1:22:13] like Gia sat there in Jerusalem and just
[1:22:17] taught other other people lived a life
[1:22:19] of just you know comfort and be well
[1:22:22] likeed by the celebrity rabbis of the of
[1:22:25] the nation but he forsook it because he
[1:22:28] didn't want to use the gift that he had
[1:22:30] in his life he he had influence before
[1:22:32] he met the Lord that's right am mean he
[1:22:35] was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he had
[1:22:36] influence he would have been able to put
[1:22:38] the word together very well he would
[1:22:40] have had a very good
[1:22:41] argument amen he wasn't just um
[1:22:44] ignoramus before he met the Lord and
[1:22:46] then suddenly he knows all the scripture
[1:22:47] and can write the New Testament by
[1:22:49] placing placing the law and Grace
[1:22:51] correctly are you with me yes here
[1:22:54] because there was a gift in this life
[1:22:57] but he but when he met the Lord he
[1:22:59] surrendered that gift he surrendered all
[1:23:00] that he was cuz he didn't want it use it
[1:23:02] for personal
[1:23:04] gain but here's a
[1:23:07] man here's a man who's not in the same
[1:23:10] bracket Numbers 22 now I'm saying
[1:23:13] there's power and
[1:23:14] humility there's great power because if
[1:23:16] we can humble ourselves for the word of
[1:23:18] God then God can use us as he wants us
[1:23:21] to use us what is success in life what
[1:23:24] is success is it is it having all the
[1:23:27] money in the world is it having a great
[1:23:29] career is it having you know all these
[1:23:32] material things is that success no no no
[1:23:35] because when you die you leave it here
[1:23:37] and you go to another place you can't
[1:23:39] take it with you amen but real success
[1:23:43] cuz we got to think about eternal things
[1:23:46] because should the should the Earth go
[1:23:47] around the Sun a few more times half of
[1:23:50] us won't be here there'll be another
[1:23:52] generation upon the Earth and we'll
[1:23:54] remember Brother s sister son what a
[1:23:56] great blessing they were what a great
[1:23:58] testimony they were he the world
[1:24:00] continues on we eventually if the world
[1:24:03] goes long enough we'll all be in the
[1:24:06] grave amen I'm going to live forever I
[1:24:09] remember being at primary school and we
[1:24:10] would say the length of that yes we want
[1:24:13] to live with I want to live
[1:24:14] 1,275 years or something that's not
[1:24:17] going to
[1:24:18] happen 100 years
[1:24:21] 120 maybe what kind of quality of Life
[1:24:24] all you have going that far down the
[1:24:27] road and then what we'll all be in the
[1:24:30] ground our bodies will be in the ground
[1:24:31] and we'll be somewhere amen so what is
[1:24:34] what is real success in life I say
[1:24:37] success in life is doing the will of God
[1:24:39] Amen that is being successful because
[1:24:42] there'll come a day where he says well
[1:24:43] done my good and faithful servant enter
[1:24:46] in the joys of the Lord he doesn't say
[1:24:48] Well done what you think is well done my
[1:24:51] good and what you think is successful
[1:24:53] it's well done my good and faithful so
[1:24:55] whatever is committed into your hand
[1:24:57] just be faithful to what he's committed
[1:24:59] into your hand amen if it's to be a mom
[1:25:01] raise a children to be a dad right you
[1:25:03] with the family whatever it is just be
[1:25:06] faithful you say Well done my good and
[1:25:08] faithful servant amen amen amen well how
[1:25:11] do you how do you do
[1:25:13] that humble
[1:25:15] thyself amen you want to be lifted
[1:25:19] up Pride God remember God resists the
[1:25:22] proud he actively people who think yeah
[1:25:25] and this world is full of it look what
[1:25:27] we did look what I did look what I
[1:25:29] planned look what I strategized look
[1:25:31] what I've done the world is full of it
[1:25:35] you see those guys that just won the
[1:25:36] America's Cup look what we've done not
[1:25:38] taking away from the achievement but
[1:25:40] they're all like look how great we are
[1:25:42] yeah look at me that's not that's not
[1:25:45] real that's not humility look at the you

[1:25:49] soccer does when they score a goal and
[1:25:52] they just they're there doing their vict
[1:25:54] three things and all these people are
[1:25:56] worshiping them from the stands and the
[1:25:58] rugby any any sport cuz they like look
[1:26:00] at me I'm a
[1:26:01] God Amen you have people like Kanye West
[1:26:05] in his concerts he actually cries out
[1:26:06] I'm a God he believes he's a god upon
[1:26:09] the
[1:26:11] Earth that shouldn't shock you that's
[1:26:13] what they think they are yeah worship me
[1:26:16] look how great I am look what I've done
[1:26:18] no they haven't done anything they've
[1:26:20] given themselves to a spirit they've
[1:26:21] sold their gift and this is what they've
[1:26:23] got yeah and where's it going to take
[1:26:28] them but if we humble ourselves under
[1:26:31] the hand of the Lord we'll be raised
[1:26:34] up is this okay everyone's gone rather
[1:26:37] quiet maybe you're thinking a bit I
[1:26:39] trust there's a few cogs going on don't
[1:26:40] worry about Monday Monday will take care
[1:26:42] of itself that's right okay don't worry
[1:26:44] about tomorrow tomorrow will just happen
[1:26:46] and then you'll have Tuesday and it'll
[1:26:48] happen and Wednesday it'll happen
[1:26:50] Thursday I think much the same amen and
[1:26:53] and then we'll find ourselves back here
[1:26:54] again amen well how was the week it just

[1:27:12] world go by you just commit it all to
[1:27:14] God commit it all to the Lord and walk
[1:27:16] with him amen that's all you need to do
[1:27:20] amen now here's balum Numbers chapter 22
[1:27:25] now humility now let's just read this
[1:27:28] numbers uh
[1:27:29] 228 and then we're going to read down to
[1:27:32] um bit of a lengthy reading down to
[1:27:33] verse 22 if you don't
[1:27:37] mind now here we are and he said unto
[1:27:40] them so the king of Moab has sent people
[1:27:43] to go hire balam who's a prophet to
[1:27:46] curse Israel because he knows that with
[1:27:49] their armies they cannot defeat Israel
[1:27:52] cuz Israel's already dealt with some
[1:27:53] other nations
[1:27:54] so he's getting a prophet he's going
[1:27:56] into religious Warfare and he's getting
[1:27:58] a prophet to use his gift to curse the
[1:28:00] enemy here we go so balam was a genuine
[1:28:04] Prophet amen he was a prophet but now
[1:28:08] here is the test now will you sell your
[1:28:10] gift will you take God's perfect will or
[1:28:13] will you take his permissive will cuz
[1:28:15] there's
[1:28:16] two amen you following me there's two
[1:28:19] there's a perfect will and there's a
[1:28:20] permissive will of God now and he said
[1:28:23] unto them Lodge here this night and I'll
[1:28:25] bring you word again as the Lord shall
[1:28:27] speak unto me and the prince of Moab
[1:28:30] Abode with balum and God said unto God
[1:28:34] came unto balam and said so here's a man
[1:28:36] who actually God speaks to him he speaks
[1:28:38] back God said unto balam what men are
[1:28:41] these with thee and balb said unto God
[1:28:44] uh balac the son of zapor King of Moab
[1:28:48] has sent me has sent unto me saying
[1:28:50] behold there's a people come out of
[1:28:52] Egypt that which cover the face of the
[1:28:54] Earth come now curse me then pray
[1:28:56] Adventure I shall be able to overcome
[1:28:59] them and drive them out now he's talking
[1:29:02] to the very God who brought them out of
[1:29:04] Egypt that's crazy isn't it think about
[1:29:06] it so here the God who actually has
[1:29:09] caused these people to be here he's
[1:29:11] actually trying to you know and God said
[1:29:13] unto balam Thou shalt not go with them
[1:29:16] Thou shalt not curse the people for they
[1:29:18] are blessed and balum Rose up in the
[1:29:20] morning and said unto the princes of Bak
[1:29:23] get you into your land for the Lord
[1:29:25] refuseth to give me leave to go with you
[1:29:28] that sounds good so far and the prince
[1:29:30] of Moab rose up and they went with went
[1:29:32] unto balac and said balam refuses to
[1:29:35] come with us and balac sent yet again
[1:29:38] princes more and more honorable than
[1:29:40] they so he's putting the pressure on
[1:29:42] here we
[1:29:44] go and they came to balum and they said
[1:29:46] to him thus sayith balac oh this sounds
[1:29:48] like Authority thus saith balac the son
[1:29:51] of zior let nothing I pray thee hinder
[1:29:53] thee from from coming unto me for I will
[1:29:56] promote thee unto uh unto very great
[1:29:58] honor and I will do whatsoever thou
[1:30:00] sayth unto me come therefore I pray thee
[1:30:03] curse me this people and balam answered
[1:30:06] and said unto the Servants of BAC if
[1:30:08] balac would give me this house his house
[1:30:10] full of silver and gold I cannot go
[1:30:13] beyond the word of the Lord my God oh
[1:30:16] he's a Believer now to do less or more
[1:30:18] now therefore I pray you carry ye also
[1:30:21] here this night oh things are going
[1:30:23] sideways that I may know what the Lord
[1:30:26] will say unto me
[1:30:28] more hasn't he just had a conversation
[1:30:31] what did God say God didn't say it in a
[1:30:33] roundabout way he said who are these
[1:30:35] people what's going on you can't curse
[1:30:37] them do not
[1:30:39] go we just read
[1:30:41] it
[1:30:43] right um now therefore okay and God said
[1:30:45] verse 20 and God came unto balam at
[1:30:47] night and said unto him if the men came
[1:30:50] come to call thee rise up and go with
[1:30:52] them but yet the word which I shall say
[1:30:55] unto thee Thou shalt do and balam Rose
[1:30:58] up in the morning and settled his ass
[1:31:00] and went with the princes of Moab and
[1:31:02] God's anger was kindled because he went
[1:31:04] and the angel of the Lord stood in the
[1:31:06] way for an adversary against him now he
[1:31:09] was riding upon his ass and his two
[1:31:12] servants were with them now we we're not
[1:31:14] just go read Numbers 22 to 25 that's
[1:31:17] your homework also go
[1:31:21] listen to does God ever change his mind
[1:31:23] mind about his word in 1965 in
[1:31:26] Jeffersonville that's your homework
[1:31:28] because it sounds like God is
[1:31:29] contradicting
[1:31:31] himself right but he's not he's allowing
[1:31:35] balum to go his permissive will right so
[1:31:38] his perfect will was do not go with them
[1:31:42] you cannot curse them because I have
[1:31:44] blessed them I'm actually the one that
[1:31:46] brought them out of Egypt do not go but
[1:31:50] his gift his life wasn't totally sold
[1:31:53] out
[1:31:54] so he still was thinking oh I could use
[1:31:56] this gift for great Advantage because
[1:31:59] remember Moab he sent more honorable
[1:32:01] princes the second time thus saith Bak
[1:32:05] you know now oh now comes this political
[1:32:07] kind of you know trying to lift them up
[1:32:09] oh here comes a greater
[1:32:12] delegation and then he and then see if
[1:32:14] he was totally sold out he would have
[1:32:16] said God's already spoken to me why have
[1:32:19] you come back God doesn't change his
[1:32:21] mind about his word what God says he
[1:32:23] says amen why why have you why have you
[1:32:26] come yeah go back I can't curse them
[1:32:29] God's blessed them God's doing this good
[1:32:31] luck to you by that's what he should
[1:32:33] have said but because his gift wasn't
[1:32:35] sold out his life wasn't totally sold
[1:32:37] out God could anoint him and use him and
[1:32:39] speak to him which he did but his whole
[1:32:41] heart wasn't given to God so God allowed
[1:32:45] him a prophet God allowed a prophet to
[1:32:48] step out of God's perfect will and step
[1:32:50] into his permissive will oh here we go
[1:32:56] Hallelujah now I'm not just trying to
[1:32:59] set something up here I want you to
[1:33:00] think about it if balum was humble to
[1:33:05] the word of God he would never have
[1:33:09] gone if he was truly humble how do I
[1:33:12] stay on this path stay
[1:33:15] humble
[1:33:17] amen and so
[1:33:19] now he takes God's permissive will but I
[1:33:24] want you to notice
[1:33:25] now God told him to go because he knew
[1:33:28] he was going to go but God didn't change
[1:33:30] his mind about what he originally said
[1:33:33] right and but because balam was had was
[1:33:37] a prophet but he wasn't one of God's
[1:33:39] children he let him go and he let him do
[1:33:43] what he did but then Jonah now God told
[1:33:46] him go go to Nineveh he didn't want to
[1:33:49] go I'm going to Tes God didn't let him
[1:33:52] go all the way God will Le us this is me
[1:33:56] here's God's perfect will our Humanity
[1:33:59] if it's not fully surrendered will take
[1:34:01] the easy way that's right cuz there is a
[1:34:04] perfect will and there's a permissive
[1:34:06] will but God will allow you to go down
[1:34:10] his permissive will to work out for his
[1:34:12] perfect will amen so here was Jonah now
[1:34:16] he's jumping on the ship to Tes this is
[1:34:18] God's permissive will but because he is
[1:34:21] one of God's children God didn't let him
[1:34:23] go to
[1:34:24] am mean God stopped him in the path you
[1:34:27] following me God stopped in the path he
[1:34:29] prepared a fish maybe I don't how many
[1:34:31] years before the storm came he was
[1:34:33] thrown into the sea Hallelujah but he
[1:34:36] let balum go all the
[1:34:38] way because he wasn't a true child of
[1:34:41] God but yet he had a he was a prophet
[1:34:45] think about it
[1:34:47] am amen but real humility if he was
[1:34:50] really humble to the word of God he
[1:34:52] would never have went
[1:34:56] amen God will permit you this is this is
[1:34:58] in does God ever change his mind about
[1:35:00] his word go listen to it whatever you do
[1:35:03] God will permit you to do something and
[1:35:04] even bless you in doing it but it still
[1:35:06] isn't his perfect
[1:35:08] will bam was blessed God anointed him
[1:35:11] that's right amen the things that he
[1:35:13] spoke are still true today whoever
[1:35:16] blesses thee Will Bless The whoever
[1:35:17] curses evil curs he speak of speak of
[1:35:20] Israel it was God speaking through him
[1:35:22] it wasn't his own ability
[1:35:24] God was speaking through
[1:35:25] them am me the things you go read Bam's
[1:35:28] three prophecies they still ringing true
[1:35:31] today but he went down God's permissive
[1:35:34] will so he was blessed amen he was
[1:35:38] blessed but it wasn't God's perfect will
[1:35:42] God he says God permitted Israel to take
[1:35:44] a law in Exodus the 19th Chapter when
[1:35:47] Grace had already given them a prophet
[1:35:49] Pillar of Fire sacrificed lamb a
[1:35:52] delivering power but they cried out for
[1:35:54] a law because they wanted to do
[1:35:56] something it wasn't God's will but it
[1:35:58] was injected because man wanted it and
[1:36:01] he was cursed by the very law that he
[1:36:03] wanted it's best to have God's will
[1:36:06] that's what he taught us thy will be
[1:36:08] done thy kingdom come thine will be done
[1:36:11] we must submit ourselves to his will and
[1:36:13] to his word don't question it believe it
[1:36:16] don't try to find a way around
[1:36:18] it amen if you're looking for a loophole
[1:36:21] in the word you will find that Loop PA
[1:36:24] yes that's right amen don't but don't go
[1:36:26] looking that's
[1:36:28] right cuz God knows our
[1:36:32] hearts just take it the way it is so
[1:36:36] many wants to go around get some other
[1:36:38] way but when you do you find yourself
[1:36:40] going on you find God blessing you but
[1:36:43] you're working in his permissive will
[1:36:45] and not in his perfect Divine
[1:36:48] will bam had a gift of faith and could
[1:36:51] have used it to the perfect original
[1:36:54] word of God he says many men on the
[1:36:56] field today with gifts of healing could
[1:36:58] do the same thing many men out there
[1:37:00] people speaking tongues people
[1:37:01] prophesying gift could use it for the
[1:37:03] kingdom but they don't and God blesses
[1:37:06] them anyhow gets the permissive will but
[1:37:08] for popularity and pleasures and
[1:37:11] personal gain they sold their birth
[1:37:13] rights as Esau did sold out to an
[1:37:15] organization sold out like balam did see
[1:37:18] and so many are doing today the same
[1:37:20] thing we know that's right notice as God
[1:37:23] said to him after he had heard the true
[1:37:25] cat decision the word don't go yes then
[1:37:28] he told him after he had seen in his
[1:37:30] heart what it was to do he gave him his
[1:37:32] permissive will so he said go and you
[1:37:35] can do the same
[1:37:38] thing if you don't want to walk in the
[1:37:41] truth you can go and have a great
[1:37:43] ministry certainly you can but you're
[1:37:45] taking his permissive will you're
[1:37:47] walking over his word he'll Prosper you
[1:37:49] certainly like he did Bam he was a
[1:37:52] success but he could could curse that
[1:37:54] people he couldn't do it cuz every time
[1:37:56] he started to curse he blessed since he
[1:37:58] couldn't do it but when he come to being
[1:38:02] um but then he came to being prosperous
[1:38:04] in his achievement he taught those
[1:38:06] people through ballic to commit adultery
[1:38:08] he brought it into the camp of Israel
[1:38:10] married them off he says why we're all
[1:38:12] one you worship the same God uh we've
[1:38:15] got a prophet up here you've got a
[1:38:16] prophet down there we have the same
[1:38:18] sacrifice the same Jehovah as our
[1:38:20] fathers why why not all just come and
[1:38:23] associate with us remember plague struck
[1:38:26] um Israel and God killed many of them
[1:38:30] thousands of them cuz he went on there
[1:38:33] his his permissive will so so balam was
[1:38:36] successful but he was going down God's
[1:38:38] permissive will
[1:38:41] amen if we are humble to the
[1:38:44] word true humility is a great power in
[1:38:47] the sight of
[1:38:48] God
[1:38:50] right if we can humble ourselves seek
[1:38:54] David King David he humbled himself this
[1:38:57] is me he humbled himself to the fact
[1:38:58] that he was called to become to to be
[1:39:01] king So when all through the fighting
[1:39:04] with Saul being on the run with you know
[1:39:06] all those different things he was able
[1:39:10] to stand there doesn't matter what was
[1:39:12] going on you read the Psalms it's not
[1:39:13] always happy he's not always rejoicing
[1:39:17] because he's in dire situations but he
[1:39:19] has confidence God is going to put me on
[1:39:22] the throne
[1:39:23] amen and he humbled himself to that
[1:39:25] calling in his
[1:39:27] life Hallelujah he didn't he could have
[1:39:30] killed Saul he didn't do anything about
[1:39:31] it he let God deal with it and God did
[1:39:34] deal with it when he was ready to step
[1:39:35] upon the
[1:39:38] throne doesn't humble thyself in 63 and
[1:39:41] sorry we're kind of going roundabout but
[1:39:43] he says now so to humble yourself before
[1:39:46] him that's really power you show me a
[1:39:49] church that's humble real humble not an
[1:39:51] arrogant church just a sweet Humble
[1:39:53] Church I'll show you a church that has
[1:39:56] favor and power of God in
[1:39:58] it amen that's right that's the thing it
[1:40:02] takes humility humbling ourselves before
[1:40:05] God and letting God just work through us
[1:40:08] don't have to make a lot of noise now we
[1:40:11] want to know how to overcome Jesus told
[1:40:14] us how to do it see humility GED himself
[1:40:17] took a towel washed the disciples feet
[1:40:19] and wiped them the very God Of Heaven
[1:40:21] humiliated himself we don't want to be
[1:40:24] humiliated that's the reason women don't
[1:40:26] want their hi gr see the reason they
[1:40:28] don't want to dress like ladies should
[1:40:30] dress like men don't want to see the
[1:40:31] same thing they don't want to get
[1:40:33] humiliated but Jesus constantly look who
[1:40:35] he was greatness I'm going to say
[1:40:37] something greatness humiliates itself
[1:40:40] Grace humbles itself greatness I've had
[1:40:43] the privilege of getting of meeting some
[1:40:45] great men and it's these guys that's got
[1:40:47] a change of clothes and 50 cents in
[1:40:50] their pocket uh uh to Rattle that's the
[1:40:52] guy that thinks he's something when he's
[1:40:54] nothing but I stood with great men I
[1:40:57] mean great men with ragged sleeves cuffs
[1:40:59] and they make you think you're a great
[1:41:01] person see greatness is humility don't
[1:41:04] forget that church greatness is
[1:41:06] expressed in humility not how fine you
[1:41:09] can be uh I don't mean um I mean humble
[1:41:12] in spirit see I don't mean just don't
[1:41:15] get out and and go to wash and clean up
[1:41:18] you should do that you know that but I'm
[1:41:20] talking about humility genuine humility
[1:41:23] not something that's put on something
[1:41:26] that's real humility Jesus told us how
[1:41:28] to overcome he overcame now overcome
[1:41:31] means to stand the test that's right
[1:41:33] just like the old Saints did like Jesus
[1:41:35] did in the midst of all his enemies he
[1:41:37] stood the test everything he was tested
[1:41:40] against he stood it in the very face of
[1:41:42] sickness and him being Messiah he healed
[1:41:44] them in the face of death he brought it
[1:41:46] back to life in the face of Calvary his
[1:41:48] own death he defeated it by surrendering
[1:41:52] himself by by the word said you destroy
[1:41:55] this Temple I raise it up in 3 days the
[1:41:57] word said so see and the presence of
[1:41:59] death he defeated it he defeated death
[1:42:01] in the presence of presence of hell he
[1:42:03] defeated hell and overcome hell yes in
[1:42:06] the presence of the Grave he overcame
[1:42:08] the grave why all by the word and
[1:42:12] humility Hallelujah and you see that in
[1:42:14] the the life of the Apostle Paul he says
[1:42:17] I don't come to you with great swelling
[1:42:19] words of man's Wisdom but I come in
[1:42:21] weakness and trembling amen because he
[1:42:25] because he was a truly humble
[1:42:27] man and this is how he operated by this
[1:42:30] is how he lived by the faith of the Son
[1:42:32] of God was by real humility yes I mean I
[1:42:36] believe when when he fell face down in
[1:42:38] the dirt on the road to Damascus amen
[1:42:41] not literally but figurative
[1:42:43] figuratively he stayed there amen he
[1:42:46] stayed in that way amen the life I now
[1:42:48] live amen it's no longer I that liveth
[1:42:51] but but Christ that liveth in me stayed
[1:42:53] humble and obedient to the word of God
[1:42:55] and that's how he was successful that's
[1:42:57] right amen and it must be the same thing
[1:42:59] with us amen amen we'll be tempted we'll
[1:43:02] be tried the devil will say can I take
[1:43:04] that gift and use it for my glory right
[1:43:06] and if you want your own personal gain
[1:43:08] you'll sell it amen but if you don't
[1:43:10] want no personal gain you want God to be
[1:43:12] glorified through you amen you wouldn't
[1:43:15] be able to sell it for the
[1:43:17] world you with me yes amen that's why we
[1:43:20] must bam did not reckon himself dead
[1:43:23] amen he did not reckon himself dead
[1:43:26] because he wanted to be wealthy he
[1:43:27] wanted to have a great name that's why
[1:43:29] he sold his gift amen but the Apostle
[1:43:32] Paul he said now you must reckon
[1:43:35] yourself dead but alive in Jesus
[1:43:38] Christ amen and so if we're to reckon
[1:43:41] ourselves Dead everything we humanly
[1:43:44] want selfishly it's got to be dead all
[1:43:47] of our own Ambitions has got to be dead
[1:43:50] you following me everything we want from
[1:43:53] our own self you the lust of the flesh
[1:43:55] as I said is not just some sexual thing
[1:43:57] it's now how can I P it to this
[1:43:59] guy amen CU this world is all about how
[1:44:02] can I how can I further me how can I
[1:44:06] enjoy all of the things that just panded
[1:44:08] to me you got to reckon Yourself Dead
[1:44:11] remember Christianity is a life of
[1:44:13] sacrifice
[1:44:15] amen it is a life of sacrifice so if we
[1:44:19] want
[1:44:19] to truly manifest him what did Jesus say
[1:44:24] you want to be my disciple deny yourself
[1:44:27] take up your cross and follow me so
[1:44:30] there has to be a denial of self you got
[1:44:31] to reckon Yourself
[1:44:33] Dead amen you got to reckon yourself
[1:44:36] when you meet
[1:44:38] him amen you follow don't just stare at
[1:44:41] me like um something on the wall That's
[1:44:42] sliding down amen but but when you
[1:44:45] really meet him you've got to reckon
[1:44:47] yourself I am dead my old self it's not
[1:44:51] me in this vessel I'm not here anymore
[1:44:53] I'm dead I mean brother Bram said if the
[1:44:57] if the life of Michelangelo was in me
[1:44:59] I'd do great masterpieces amen if the
[1:45:02] life of D Vinci was in me I'd do great
[1:45:03] things if I the life of John Diller in
[1:45:06] me you know I do certain things but if
[1:45:08] the life of Jesus Christ is in me I will
[1:45:11] do the works of Jesus Christ and two of
[1:45:13] us can't live in the same house one has
[1:45:15] to be dead for the other one to be
[1:45:18] alive Hallelujah that's how it has to be
[1:45:21] so if we live by the faith of the Son of
[1:45:23] God we cannot be
[1:45:25] alive amen this world remember if if the
[1:45:29] world can try and get this flesh to live
[1:45:31] again why does unforgiveness come in why
[1:45:34] does the devil L why does he try to push
[1:45:36] unforgiveness or bidness down down your
[1:45:38] throat because if he can you can't live
[1:45:41] by the faith of the Son of God anymore
[1:45:43] am mean cuz perfect faith comes with
[1:45:45] perfect
[1:45:46] forgiveness amen a root of buness can
[1:45:48] defile Paul Paul wrote about it amen so
[1:45:53] if that can happen then you know that's
[1:45:56] why the devil tries to push buness down
[1:45:58] he tries to allow bter experiences to
[1:46:00] happen and he tries to allow he that's
[1:46:03] why he works on your mind remember what
[1:46:04] happened last year remember how that
[1:46:06] person treated you there remember what
[1:46:08] happened with those Believers there and
[1:46:09] all this that happened am mean cuz he's
[1:46:11] trying to grow a bitterness in you you
[1:46:14] follow me and if you can dwell on that
[1:46:16] then you can't walk with God as we're
[1:46:18] meant to walk that's right Hallelujah
[1:46:21] but there's a bomb and Gilead amen as as
[1:46:23] Moses they came through the Red Sea they
[1:46:25] came to a bitter bitter spring of water
[1:46:29] amen and many Travelers I've said it
[1:46:30] before but many Travelers would have
[1:46:32] passed through that water and it was
[1:46:34] just bitter amen but there was a tree
[1:46:36] there God said to Moses cut down that
[1:46:38] tree throw it into the water and and
[1:46:40] it'll be made sweet amen amen God
[1:46:42] inspired the prophet cut down that tree
[1:46:45] throw it into the water that's the same
[1:46:46] thing with us everyone has bad
[1:46:48] experiences in life that's right life is
[1:46:50] full of TR life of man is few days and
[1:46:53] full of trouble right so we all have bad
[1:46:56] experiences but there's a differences
[1:46:59] that one person can have a bad
[1:47:00] experience and it's still bitter when
[1:47:03] they think about it but the other one
[1:47:05] they're inspired take the cross take
[1:47:07] that tree amen cut it down throw it into
[1:47:09] the experience it'll become sweet am me
[1:47:12] it won't be a busness in your memory
[1:47:14] anymore but you say praise God H you
[1:47:17] gave me the grace to forgive them thank
[1:47:18] you gave me the grace to overcome that
[1:47:20] thing to lay it down and move on Amen
[1:47:23] amen what are you going to
[1:47:26] do Hallelujah that's why he brings
[1:47:29] things in never look at that's why put
[1:47:32] your past under the
[1:47:35] blood walk on Amen walk on that's a
[1:47:39] terrible
[1:47:40] thing walk
[1:47:42] on amen that's all you have to do can we
[1:47:45] have some musicians to come otherwise
[1:47:46] I'll just keep standing here where some
[1:47:48] musicians to come amen you got to put it
[1:47:51] on remember we are walking we got to
[1:47:53] reckon ourselves dead that means your
[1:47:56] old life whatever you did in this flesh
[1:48:00] is dead it's not even attributed you
[1:48:03] know Abraham God told God told Abraham
[1:48:06] after Isaac was born take thy son thine
[1:48:09] only
[1:48:10] son take him sacrifice him on a mountain
[1:48:14] I'll show you now but you think in your
[1:48:16] mind well but actually Abraham had
[1:48:17] another
[1:48:18] son he had he had um ishma but he didn't
[1:48:23] that was
[1:48:24] Abraham that was Abraham that was the
[1:48:27] life he produced from his first birth
[1:48:30] amen that was what he produced from his
[1:48:31] first birth but now he's a new creature
[1:48:33] now because a Life represent a name
[1:48:36] represents a life amen so his name was
[1:48:39] changed representing now the life you're
[1:48:40] now living is not Abraham you're Abraham
[1:48:43] you're father of Nations amen hallelujah
[1:48:46] that's why God said take thy son Abraham
[1:48:48] I'm not talking to the old you the old
[1:48:51] you is dead you're a new creature in me
[1:48:54] hallelujah amen take take thy son thine
[1:48:56] only son and take him and sacrifice him
[1:48:59] there so God can look at a man under the
[1:49:02] blood of bulls and goats that way how
[1:49:04] much more are people under the blood of
[1:49:06] Jesus Christ amen that have been
[1:49:08] transformed by his Spirit how much more
[1:49:10] that oh but there's still the life I
[1:49:13] produced from my old nature no God
[1:49:15] doesn't remember it God doesn't see it
[1:49:18] God doesn't attribute it to you anymore
[1:49:20] it's dead that's right Hallelujah
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:25] amen I want to let's just stand shall
[1:49:30] we the life you and your old life dead

[1:49:51] last week it was a terrible week for me
[1:49:53] but under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:49:55] whatever you do don't dwell on anything
[1:49:58] that's not of him it's not worth it
[1:50:02] people have treated me in a real bad way
[1:50:04] Let It Go remember job I know brother
[1:50:07] Bley brought this out when he was here
[1:50:09] job's trial ended when he
[1:50:12] prayed I just going to read that

[1:50:16] scripture says in the Book of
[1:50:19] Job last chapter of job
[1:50:23] and verse
[1:50:25] 10 you got that up it says and the Lord
[1:50:28] so so God tells job's friends to take an
[1:50:32] offering take it to job and he will pray
[1:50:35] for them that God's Wrath is turned from
[1:50:37] them and then so and so here were some

[1:50:43] God really was they were false preachers
[1:50:46] preaching bad youo try to tell job lies
[1:50:50] even though they didn't you cuz they
