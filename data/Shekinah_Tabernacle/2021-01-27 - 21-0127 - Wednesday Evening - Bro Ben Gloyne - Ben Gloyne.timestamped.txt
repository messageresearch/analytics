[34:45] different stuff and so i think we found
[34:47] the solution but yeah just
[34:49] be with us praise the lord um let's go
[34:52] to philippians chapter three
[34:55] i'm going to read a couple of scriptures
[34:57] and then we're going to go to
[34:58] matthew chapter 2.
[35:11] i mean philippians 3 and 12.
[35:18] hey man so just say amen when you're
[35:20] there
[35:22] amen so this is paul speaking here
[35:24] saying not
[35:25] as though i had already attained either
[35:28] were already perfect
[35:29] but i follow after if that i may
[35:33] apprehend
[35:33] that which also i am apprehended of
[35:36] christ jesus
[35:37] brethren i count myself not to have
[35:39] apprehended but this one thing i do
[35:42] forgetting those things which are behind
[35:44] and reaching forth
[35:45] under those things which are before i
[35:47] press toward the mark of the
[35:49] for the prize the high calling of god in
[35:52] christ jesus
[35:53] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[35:56] be thus minded and if anything
[35:58] ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal
[36:02] even this unto you amen amen then we're
[36:05] going to go to matthew
[36:06] chapter 2 we're going to read from verse
[36:07] 7 this is speaking of of the wise men
[36:10] and then we're going to go to
[36:10] revelations 22 we're going to read one
[36:12] verse there
[36:17] amen this kind of ties in with what
[36:19] brother isaac was preaching on sunday
[36:22] i enjoyed that amen
[36:25] i mean yeah i was driving actually uh up
[36:27] to the straw eggs on
[36:29] on friday and just this thought came to
[36:32] mind
[36:33] the journey is worth it this is what i'm
[36:35] saying at the journey and i'm talking
[36:36] about journey to heaven now
[36:38] it's worth it i mean so matthew 2 and
[36:41] verse 7 says then herod when he had
[36:45] privileged called the wise men remember
[36:47] his
[36:47] here come these foreigners they've come
[36:49] in with a great yeah they just burst
[36:50] through the gates where is he born king
[36:52] of the jews
[36:53] you know they were under expectation you
[36:54] know inquired of them diligently
[36:57] what time the star appeared and he sent
[36:59] them to bethlehem said
[37:01] go and search diligently for the young
[37:03] child and when ye have found him bring
[37:05] me word again though i may come and
[37:07] worship him also
[37:09] when they had heard the king they
[37:11] departed and lo the star which they saw
[37:13] in the east went before them
[37:15] till it came and stood over where the
[37:17] young child was
[37:18] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[37:20] with exceeding great joy
[37:22] i mean they had a praise break right
[37:24] there harlow they had a shouting time
[37:27] don't you get excited when you see your
[37:28] destination yeah you can be sitting in
[37:30] the car for hours and if you're young
[37:32] you say we're there yet
[37:33] are we there yet are we there yet but
[37:35] then finally the destination comes
[37:37] hallelujah
[37:38] amen so they rejoice with exceeding
[37:39] great joy and when they came into the
[37:42] house they saw the young
[37:43] child with mary his mother and fell down
[37:45] and worshipped him
[37:46] and when they had opened their treasures
[37:48] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[37:49] frankincense and myrrh
[37:51] and being warned of god in a dream that
[37:52] they should not return to here they
[37:54] departed into their own country
[37:56] another way then was going to read one
[37:58] more scripture

[38:27] his name shall be in their foreheads

[38:32] let's just bow heads in a word of prayer

[38:34] oh lord jesus lord just to think one day
[38:38] we're going to live that scripture out

[38:43] lord we're really going to see you face
[38:45] to face lord and give you praise and
[38:46] glory lord that
[38:48] those who feel your spirit among us even
[38:50] now lord as you've been
[38:51] drawing us lord and but lord one day
[38:53] lord we don't just feel your presence
[38:55] like this but we'll see you face to face
[38:57] that's the hour we look for oh god that
[38:59] you'd take us away and a rapture lord
[39:01] and we'll walk on streets of gold
[39:03] lord jesus to to see you lord surely the
[39:06] city will be a great sight but lord
[39:08] you're the one we want to see
[39:09] so lord i pray you just take this little
[39:11] thought lord and bless it to our hearts
[39:13] father for your glory
[39:14] and we love you so much and we thank you
[39:16] in jesus christ's name
[39:17] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[39:20] have your seats tonight
[39:21] i mean as i said the journey is worth it
[39:25] must have been quite a quite a time for
[39:28] those wise men you know we uh we're told
[39:30] that they traveled a great
[39:32] a great distance from up in persia or
[39:34] you know up in the east and they
[39:36] traveled for about two years and they
[39:37] were following the star and
[39:39] you know no doubt you know we know
[39:40] journeys uh
[39:42] journeys have difficulty in them you
[39:44] know they're not always
[39:46] easy journeys you know sometimes kids
[39:47] can get real carsick
[39:49] then they get car sick some more and
[39:50] sometimes the tire can go flat there can
[39:52] be action it's gonna be delays and
[39:54] you know but as long as it's on your
[39:55] heart i'm going to make this journey
[39:57] i mean that's the thing that really
[39:59] matters now in order to make a journey
[40:01] now the i just googled what journey
[40:04] means and it means an act of traveling
[40:05] from one place to another
[40:07] i'm sure that wasn't a bunch of rocket
[40:09] science to us all but
[40:12] we're on a journey we're going from
[40:14] earth to glory
[40:16] they travel from one part of the earth
[40:18] to another part of the earth but we're
[40:19] not traveling this way we're traveling
[40:21] this way
[40:22] hallelujah and we are in that journey
[40:24] you know even even as paul would say in
[40:26] the book of ephesians that
[40:27] the lord quickening us by his spirit
[40:29] making us alive in him washing all our
[40:31] sins away making us new creatures in him
[40:33] you know he has translated us into the
[40:35] kingdom of his dear sons already we have
[40:37] gone
[40:38] on a journey right we're under the
[40:40] powers of darkness but now we're under
[40:42] the power of light
[40:43] amen and even he said he's caused us to
[40:46] sit in heavenly places in christ jesus
[40:48] there was once upon a time when we
[40:49] didn't sit in that position
[40:50] i mean but the lord and his grace caused
[40:52] us to move into that position hallelujah
[40:55] i mean but in order to take a journey
[40:58] you must believe that that place is
[41:00] there to travel to
[41:01] i would never travel to australia if i
[41:03] didn't believe australia was real
[41:06] it's very elementary but you know if if
[41:09] australia was just a myth i'd say i
[41:10] can't travel there i don't believe it's
[41:11] real
[41:13] in order and also to in order to travel
[41:15] somewhere you must believe you
[41:17] can travel there you've got to believe
[41:19] that you can get on a plane and it's
[41:21] a lot more difficult nowadays but you
[41:22] can still do it you can get on a plane
[41:24] and travel to where you want to go
[41:26] and in order to travel somewhere you
[41:28] must believe that you have the means to
[41:30] get there
[41:32] amen you gotta so so so you must believe
[41:34] the places there
[41:35] right you must believe that you can
[41:37] travel there and you must believe
[41:39] that you have uh that you have the means
[41:41] to travel there i mean so we believe
[41:44] not by tradition but by revelation that
[41:46] heaven is a place prepared for us
[41:48] right we have an eternal thoughty body
[41:50] waiting for us in the heavens right
[41:51] so so that's been revealed to us it's
[41:53] more than tradition it's a reality
[41:56] amen and then we must say we must
[41:57] believe that there's a heaven to go to
[41:59] yes that's why this message came to us i
[42:02] mean to
[42:02] to for for our lord jesus to reveal
[42:04] himself to us because
[42:06] he wanted you to know there's a place
[42:07] for you
[42:09] this is not the end of your destiny you
[42:10] know this is not the ending resting
[42:12] place for you but there's a place to go
[42:14] to
[42:15] amen and also that you have the means to
[42:18] get there
[42:20] we have the means to get there and it's
[42:22] not in our human ability but
[42:23] god's gonna pack us hallelujah the you
[42:26] know the
[42:26] you know rebecca watered some camels and
[42:29] those camels that she watered when
[42:31] when when eleazar came together those
[42:33] same camels packed it to her isaac
[42:36] and the same holy spirit that's here
[42:37] upon the earth that we water with praise
[42:39] and worship and thanksgiving
[42:41] that same spirit is going to pack us
[42:42] amen to the lord of glory
[42:44] hallelujah that's why it's worth it i
[42:46] mean to water the camels
[42:49] that's why it's worth it to praise the
[42:50] lord hallelujah return everything he
[42:52] does you just just just return it and
[42:54] praise unto him
[42:55] harley what's happening the the camilla
[42:57] being i know it's very crude expression
[43:00] to compare the holy ghost to a camel but
[43:01] yo
[43:02] now that camel's getting refreshed it's
[43:04] getting hydrated
[43:06] it's ready for its return journey
[43:08] because the reason the message came is
[43:09] to take a people with it
[43:10] because the message is jesus christ it's
[43:12] a person it's not a bunch of doctrine
[43:14] it's not even 1100 tapes
[43:15] it's a person being expressed it's jesus
[43:18] christ being expressed
[43:19] so he came to earth to take you to glory
[43:22] he didn't come to earth to set up a
[43:23] kingdom
[43:24] right physical kingdom upon the earth he
[43:27] came to the earth to set up a kingdom
[43:28] and you the kingdom of god is within you
[43:31] to take you into glory that's why i love
[43:33] it you know we speak about where in the
[43:35] process of the coming of the lord which
[43:36] we are
[43:37] amen because the lord himself has
[43:38] descended with a shout right but it's
[43:40] really where the process off is going
[43:43] because this is a secret going away amen
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:47] why are you a believer to leave
[43:50] hallelujah why why are we at church here
[43:53] to leave
[43:55] now humanly that doesn't make much sense
[43:56] here people move to a place they
[43:58] establish themselves because they want
[43:59] to stay
[44:00] but we're here to establish ourselves in
[44:02] the faith to leave
[44:04] we're on a journey do you believe that
[44:06] you have the ability to get there
[44:08] remember he'll carry you there rebecca
[44:09] didn't walk i don't believe a single
[44:11] inch of that journey she just sat on the
[44:12] camel
[44:13] and she heard eleazar tell her about her
[44:15] isaac
[44:16] hallelujah we're on our way we're moving
[44:20] hallelujah we're not staying here
[44:22] hallelujah
[44:24] i'm glad i'm glad we're on the move
[44:27] amen so these wise men they must have
[44:30] had it must have been an incredible
[44:31] thing
[44:33] that what they were looking for that
[44:35] star gripped them
[44:37] amen it gripped them you could say even
[44:39] they coveted the star
[44:41] in a way they had a desire for its there
[44:44] was a hunger
[44:45] all the other stars didn't didn't give
[44:46] them that kind of hunger maybe it just
[44:48] you know excited their minds a bit but
[44:51] that star spoke to them in a different
[44:52] way
[44:53] and they're only satisfied when they got
[44:55] to the end of their journey
[44:56] it's the same thing with you and i will
[44:58] only be satisfied when we see him
[45:01] when these bodies are changed you know
[45:02] you'll know there's always more of god
[45:04] for you
[45:05] because this body is still the same
[45:08] right when our bodies have changed we'll
[45:10] know that we have made to our
[45:11] destination right
[45:12] hallelujah amen amen that's why the
[45:15] apostle paul would say i want to
[45:17] apprehend that which has apprehended me
[45:20] i mean you could say that that star
[45:21] apprehended the wise men they were
[45:23] obsessed with this heavenly body moving
[45:25] in the heavens
[45:26] they had to follow it they had to focus
[45:28] upon it all their life and what they
[45:29] were doing became secondary
[45:31] to following the star and they followed
[45:33] that star all the way to where the
[45:34] christ child was and they rejoiced
[45:37] hallelujah you think about a rejoicing
[45:39] time when we when we step from this
[45:41] world to the next world
[45:42] that's why i think we must just start
[45:43] rejoicing now
[45:45] why not this message is said to identify
[45:49] people it's the bride of christ
[45:51] identification
[45:52] brother braham said that the bridegroom
[45:54] call will come right through this
[45:55] and he says i may not do it but this
[45:58] message will introduce jesus christ
[46:00] to the world did it introduce jesus
[46:02] christ to you
[46:03] more than a tradition more than i'd say
[46:05] even more than ink on paper but a living
[46:07] god
[46:07] manifesting a living word in your life
[46:10] what's happened
[46:11] jesus christ has been introduced you and
[46:13] why why was he introduced you for you to
[46:15] leave
[46:16] hallelujah i'm out of here glory
[46:22] i don't know what kind of difficulty
[46:23] those wise men had i don't know if their
[46:25] camels blew a tyre
[46:27] i don't know you know i don't know if
[46:29] one of them hurt themselves or i don't
[46:30] know what kind of difficulty they had
[46:32] but
[46:32] to travel from if you just go google
[46:34] maps you know they didn't fly
[46:37] they didn't drive they didn't sit on a
[46:39] train they sat on a camel
[46:41] and a camel isn't really the most
[46:43] glamorous mode of transport
[46:46] not that i've ever been on a camel but
[46:47] i've been on a horse and you know
[46:49] it can get a bit uncomfortable but they
[46:52] didn't worry about that
[46:54] they were focused on their end goal and
[46:57] i could say
[46:58] you know if i could put words in their
[47:00] mouth when they laid the gold the
[47:02] frankincense and the mirror at the feet
[47:03] of jesus and they worshipped him
[47:05] they would have said you know what this
[47:07] journey was worth it
[47:08] this journey was really worth it even
[47:10] with the hardship maybe the
[47:12] trouble the peril whatever they had to
[47:14] face and say this journey was worth it
[47:16] i mean the queen of sheba had to travel
[47:18] quite a way to see solomon
[47:21] she just she heard about she heard about
[47:24] this king in israel that had this gift
[47:25] of wisdom and the
[47:27] incredible things that were going on
[47:28] when you know you know when people would
[47:30] come up in front of him and the
[47:31] incredible gift of
[47:32] you know that solomon had and something
[47:34] just stirred in her heart i'm gonna go
[47:35] see that
[47:37] it's a good way to be i'm gonna go check
[47:38] that out i'm not satisfied just by
[47:41] hearing what the merchants say when they
[47:42] travel from here and what's the news in
[47:44] jerusalem and
[47:45] you know she just said i'm gonna go see
[47:46] it and then when she went to go see
[47:48] solomon all her life was laid bare and
[47:50] all her hard questions were answered and
[47:52] you know no doubt she would have said
[47:53] this journey was worth it
[47:55] hallelujah this journey was worth it
[47:58] amen you know but sometimes journeys
[48:00] they can cut very deep naaman was a
[48:04] mighty man of syria
[48:06] but he had a secret he was a leper and
[48:09] we know that you know
[48:10] no doubt he could you know his brother
[48:11] ron spencer preached that sermon to me
[48:13] that's one of the most powerful sermons
[48:14] i've ever heard
[48:15] neyman was a leper but he had to make a
[48:18] journey
[48:18] he had to be willing to accept the
[48:21] testimony of a slave girl
[48:23] and then go to the king of syria saying
[48:24] i need to go to israel because there's a
[48:26] prophet there that can heal me
[48:27] he had to be willing to basically expose
[48:29] his secret to go get a healing
[48:32] and so he made the journey you know from
[48:34] from damascus wherever he was down into
[48:37] israel and
[48:38] you know the leader was given to the
[48:39] king and the king misunderstood it and
[48:41] you know
[48:41] he thought the king of syria was trying
[48:43] to pick a fight with him you know
[48:45] trying to try to get him to do it but
[48:46] then you know you know the prophet sent
[48:48] a servant said no just just send them to
[48:49] me
[48:50] and maybe maybe when when naaman is is
[48:53] is traveling on this journey
[48:55] he he maybe begins to form in his mind
[48:58] what's going to happen when he reaches
[49:00] his destination
[49:02] and he has no idea in his mind that he
[49:04] has to humble himself
[49:05] that the prophet himself is not even
[49:07] going to talk to him but a servant's
[49:08] going to go out
[49:09] because remember he's a general he's a
[49:10] fancy guy he's the up and ups
[49:12] you know he doesn't just talk to the
[49:14] common people he talks to the fancy
[49:16] you know yeah yeah the royal you know
[49:18] you know the guys with the fancy clothes
[49:19] and the you know the big long titles and
[49:21] the
[49:21] you know those in there they'll drown if
[49:23] it rains kind of people you know he was
[49:24] he was those kind of people
[49:26] but then the prophet didn't even come
[49:27] out and speak to him i was just a
[49:29] servant
[49:30] and the servant just said go dip in the
[49:31] river jordan seven times
[49:33] he was at his destination he was at the
[49:35] prophet's house i don't know what
[49:37] he was under expectation because he
[49:38] believed the testimony remember
[49:40] he had to believe that he could be
[49:42] healed of this leprosy
[49:43] no one in history had been healed i
[49:45] think i might be wrong there but you
[49:47] know they didn't have a doctor they
[49:48] didn't have medicine no one could do it
[49:50] but this prophet because he knew the
[49:52] lord and so so he journeyed there
[49:55] and then he heard this message go dip in
[49:57] the river jordan seven times and he got
[49:59] offended
[50:01] that's why sometimes the journey can
[50:03] take a lot of you know it can really
[50:04] beat us down
[50:06] because there's a lot of things that
[50:07] we're going to get rid of we're going to
[50:08] jettison
[50:09] and the first thing he had to jettison
[50:11] was his pride i'm the general of assyria
[50:14] you know i'm a mighty conqueror he had
[50:17] to conquer himself
[50:19] to get what he needed when he got to his
[50:20] destination
[50:22] amen and you know he he he rode off in a
[50:24] huff and his servant said no
[50:26] oh mighty general name and live forever
[50:28] you know
[50:29] mighty great general fancy man you know
[50:32] what if he asked you to do something
[50:34] hard wouldn't you do something hard
[50:36] if he asked you to go to some great high
[50:37] mountain get a little flower this big
[50:39] and boil it and drink it yeah wouldn't
[50:40] you go and done it
[50:41] he asked you to do something easy why
[50:43] don't you just do the easy thing
[50:45] yeah many times it's actually the gospel
[50:46] is actually very easy but we're going to
[50:48] be willing to give ourselves to the word
[50:50] for for us to get what the word wants to
[50:52] give us amen he wants to give us eternal
[50:54] life
[50:54] that's a good thing to receive we must
[50:57] be born again
[50:58] hallelujah so so he so he listened to
[51:00] his servants and he dipped once
[51:02] twice three times still no change
[51:05] maybe he's getting a little bit sick of
[51:06] it four
[51:09] five six
[51:12] seven he comes back up again and the
[51:16] thing he
[51:17] thing he came to get he received
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:20] but same thing with us you know we've
[51:22] come to the word
[51:24] that we would become the word right this
[51:27] is our mirror
[51:29] i'll say i am not your example
[51:33] this is your example this is the message
[51:37] right i'm not your example the message
[51:39] is your example
[51:40] this is our mirror don't even try and
[51:43] match me
[51:44] whatever you do that's a that's a real
[51:46] bad idea
[51:48] that's the word line yourself up with
[51:50] the scripture
[51:51] amen but you know he had to make a
[51:53] journey he had to he had to be willing
[51:56] to be humbled
[51:58] and thank god he actually took
[52:00] correction from his servant and did what
[52:01] the prophet told them
[52:03] he got healed hallelujah some journeys
[52:06] have incredible hardship
[52:09] the apostle paul had an incredible life
[52:11] he didn't have an easy life
[52:13] he had a far easier life no doubt before
[52:15] he met the lord then after he met the
[52:17] lord
[52:18] amen he was he was a pharisee of the
[52:20] pharisees
[52:21] he there's no record of him being
[52:23] shipwrecked before he met the lord
[52:24] or being beaten or being chased from
[52:26] city to city or
[52:28] being hungry or put in jail there's none
[52:30] of that recorded of his first life
[52:32] but after he met the lord he really
[52:34] started his journey
[52:35] and when you start walking with the lord
[52:37] doesn't matter how many years you've
[52:38] been going
[52:39] the journey is harder than before you
[52:41] become a christian why because now
[52:42] you've got resistance
[52:44] we had no resistance when we're serving
[52:46] the devil because he's saying
[52:47] well done i'm on your side
[52:50] but then one day the real call from
[52:53] yonder came up
[52:54] hallelujah and then we begin to walk
[52:55] with the lord and the devil get gets mad
[52:57] at that kind of thing
[52:59] you shouldn't be surprised at this
[53:00] opposition
[53:02] hallelujah but greater is he that's in
[53:04] you that he that's in the world
[53:06] amen to already have the victory over
[53:07] that thing that we're facing
[53:10] amen amen the apostle paul would tell us
[53:12] now this
[53:13] let's just think about this he says he
[53:16] says i speak as concerning reproach as
[53:18] though i have been weak how be it
[53:20] wherever any is bold i speak foolishly
[53:23] i'm bold also are they hebrews so am i
[53:25] are they israelites so am i are they the
[53:28] seed of abraham so am i
[53:30] are they ministers of christ i speak as
[53:31] a full i am more and laborers
[53:33] more abundant and stripes above measure
[53:35] and prisons more frequent and deaths
[53:37] deaths oft you know someone said i can't
[53:40] remember but
[53:41] you know when you know paul got into
[53:42] such a you know
[53:44] paul saw a pattern in his life he'd go
[53:46] to a new place
[53:48] he'd preach the enemy would raise up a
[53:50] mob
[53:51] and he'd be put in jail how's the
[53:54] missionary trip going brother paul
[53:56] real good i'm in the i'm in the worst
[53:58] cell we had a real good meeting
[54:01] this is how he found himself people
[54:02] would chase him from city to city he'd
[54:04] go to a new place he'd preach
[54:06] you know one place he would be preaching
[54:08] and and mighty miracles were done and
[54:10] the people thought that um
[54:11] they were jupiter and uh mercury they
[54:14] were the gods
[54:16] and they were about to sacrifice to them
[54:18] and he said no no we're not gods we're
[54:20] just like you but the lord jesus christ
[54:22] is alive he's the one who does these
[54:23] things
[54:24] and then the people that chased him out
[54:25] of the city before turn up
[54:27] and they somehow swing these people who
[54:29] think that paul and i can't remember who
[54:30] it was silas or whoever
[54:32] that they were gods they swing their
[54:33] opinion from them being guides to them
[54:35] being devils because they stone paul
[54:39] sometimes you think everything's going
[54:40] well and everyone's like praise the lord
[54:42] and but you know
[54:43] it's amazing how we don't want to end up
[54:46] like that i'll just i'll just leave it
[54:47] like that
[54:48] you know we don't want to just let
[54:49] opinion shift because what other people
[54:51] said
[54:51] but what have we seen what have we
[54:53] experienced in this world
[54:54] i've seen transforming power i've seen
[54:57] deliverance i've seen the holy ghost
[54:58] fall
[54:58] i've seen lives change i've seen healing
[55:00] i've seen deliverance i've seen people
[55:02] transformed i've seen the word put on
[55:04] flesh that's what i've seen
[55:06] they saw mighty miracles done but yet
[55:08] their opinions were changed by these
[55:09] other people
[55:10] we all know what i'm talking about eh
[55:12] you read that in the book of acts i just
[55:13] marvel at that kind of thing
[55:14] one day they're praising him thinking
[55:16] he's a god and the next day they
[55:18] they just stoned him and they hate the
[55:19] guy oh because people came along and
[55:22] second opinions five came out and it was
[55:23] red anyway so
[55:26] amen of the jews so we're in 11 24 of
[55:30] the jews five times sorry
[55:32] um and stripes above measure and prisons
[55:34] more frequent and deaths oft
[55:36] of the jews five times i received 40
[55:39] stripes save one
[55:40] thrice was i beaten with rods once i was
[55:42] stoned
[55:43] thrice i suffered shipwreck a day in the
[55:45] night i have been in the deep
[55:48] amen that okay in journeys often in
[55:50] perils of waters and perils of robbers
[55:52] and perils by my own countrymen
[55:54] and perils by the heathen and perils in
[55:55] the city and perils in the wilderness
[55:57] and perils in the sea
[55:58] and perils among false brethren he's had
[56:00] perils everywhere
[56:02] this is a journey and weariness and
[56:05] painfulness and watchings often and
[56:07] hunger and thirst and fastings often in
[56:09] cold and nakedness
[56:10] beside those things which are without
[56:12] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[56:15] of all the churches
[56:17] so it all has trouble but then this
[56:18] great burden i must get this word out
[56:21] because remember
[56:21] if someone's really on the journey to
[56:24] glory they have a burden
[56:26] i can't walk this alone this is not a
[56:28] solo trip i want everyone to come
[56:30] paulus he had a great burden you know
[56:32] because he saw churches birth ministries
[56:34] be established
[56:35] and then his burden was lord keep them
[56:37] strengthen them
[56:39] may your word just multiply in their
[56:40] midst may
[56:42] may people become believers man you know
[56:44] keep them in the faith lord
[56:46] so he had a lot of burdens who is weak
[56:49] am i not weak who is offended i
[56:50] burn not if i must need glory i will
[56:53] glory of the things which concern
[56:55] my infirmities and the god and father
[56:59] our lord jesus christ which is blessed
[57:01] forevermore knoweth that i lie
[57:03] not he says in damascus the governor uh
[57:06] under uh aratus the king kept the city
[57:08] of of the
[57:09] damascus with the garrison desires to
[57:12] apprehend me
[57:13] and through a window in a basket was i
[57:14] let down by the wall and escaped his
[57:16] hands
[57:17] he had an incredible journey but his
[57:19] destination was the thing that
[57:21] was was was driving him it wasn't the
[57:24] peril it wasn't the hardship it wasn't
[57:26] the shipwrecks the beatings the stonings
[57:28] what was going on
[57:29] it was i have a place to go hallelujah
[57:32] he would he would come to the end of his
[57:34] road
[57:35] and he would begin to tell timothy he
[57:38] says
[57:40] he says but now i'm ready to be offered
[57:42] this is some of his last words that he
[57:43] repented timothy before his head was
[57:45] taken from his body
[57:46] for now i'm ready to be offered and the
[57:49] time of my departure is at hand
[57:51] i afford a good fight i have finished my
[57:54] course i have kept the faith
[57:56] what incredible you know if you could
[57:57] put that as an epitaph on someone's
[57:59] tombstone
[58:00] what an incredible thing i afford a good
[58:02] fight
[58:03] i have finished my course i have kept
[58:05] the faith hallelujah i trust that's how
[58:08] you know if we could just say those
[58:09] words i pray that you know
[58:12] our names would be associated with that
[58:14] scripture when we think of that
[58:15] scripture i think of brother umph or
[58:16] brother james or
[58:17] anyone here i could name you all one by
[58:20] one but you know that would be our
[58:23] how we feel oh how we're known by
[58:26] henceforth there is later for me a crown
[58:28] of righteousness which the lord the
[58:29] righteous judge
[58:31] shall give me at that day and not to me
[58:33] only but unto all them that love his
[58:36] appearing do you love it when he appears
[58:40] when his presence comes among us amen
[58:43] you may be at home reading just praying
[58:45] and he just comes
[58:47] hardly it becomes more than a story it
[58:49] becomes more than just
[58:50] a song more than a message but you know
[58:53] but he appears
[58:56] hallelujah amen
[59:01] he knew he had a crown of life laid up
[59:03] for him
[59:05] he believed that there was a place for
[59:07] him he believed he had the ability to
[59:09] get there
[59:10] right the holy ghost was going to take
[59:12] him there i mean so all the trouble of
[59:14] life
[59:16] vanished compared
[59:19] to where he was going to go i pray that
[59:22] heaven is so real to us
[59:25] i pray it's more than a nice idea when
[59:27] we think of the dead in christ rising
[59:29] i pray it's such a reality that we're
[59:32] literally
[59:32] going to see them they may well they
[59:35] don't need the door they can just walk
[59:36] through the wall
[59:37] hallelujah they'll say it's on
[59:41] what you've been longing for it's on
[59:45] hallelujah amen as
[59:48] as he would say
[59:51] amen he says for i reckon that the
[59:53] sufferings of this present time are not
[59:55] worthy to begin
[59:56] to be compared with the glory that shall
[59:58] be revealed in us so you're saying this
[1:00:00] journey
[1:00:01] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:00:03] destination
[1:00:05] hallelujah because the destination's
[1:00:06] awesome hallelujah
[1:00:10] hey man i trust that no no i'm just
[1:00:12] going to wind this up just
[1:00:14] just with this one scripture i pray that
[1:00:17] we can look back on our lives and we can
[1:00:19] see that the lord was with us all the
[1:00:20] time
[1:00:23] remember it's not in the good times it's
[1:00:24] in the bad times it's in the hard times
[1:00:27] you know you can see he he he never left
[1:00:29] me alone
[1:00:30] he was always there amen he would say in
[1:00:33] isaiah 43
[1:00:35] but now thus saith the lord that created
[1:00:37] the o jacob and he that formed the o
[1:00:39] israel fear not
[1:00:41] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[1:00:43] thee by thy name thou
[1:00:45] art mine and we are not our own we're
[1:00:48] bought with a price the precious blood
[1:00:49] of jesus christ
[1:00:51] when they'll pass us through the waters
[1:00:53] i'll be with thee
[1:00:55] glory hey we're going to pass through
[1:00:57] some waters i'm sure you can look back
[1:00:59] on your life and say i passed through
[1:01:00] some waters
[1:01:02] what you know yeah it wasn't just a
[1:01:03] trickle of a you know down a down uh
[1:01:05] down a guttering but it was a
[1:01:06] it was a big it was a big moving body of
[1:01:09] water
[1:01:10] it was a deep place i'll be with thee
[1:01:12] and and through the rivers
[1:01:14] they shall not overflow thee when
[1:01:16] they'll walk us through the fire
[1:01:18] thou shall not be burned neither shall
[1:01:20] the flame kindle upon thee
[1:01:22] for i am the lord thy god the holy one
[1:01:24] of israel thy savior i gave egypt for
[1:01:26] thy ransom ethiopia and see before thee
[1:01:29] since that was precious in my sight
[1:01:31] glory
[1:01:32] thou hast been honorable and i have
[1:01:34] loved thee therefore i will give men for
[1:01:36] thee
[1:01:37] and people for thy life fear not for i'm
[1:01:40] with thee
[1:01:40] i will bring thy seed from the east and
[1:01:42] gather thee from the west
[1:01:44] hallelujah so i trust we can you know we
[1:01:46] can say he's always been with me
[1:01:49] and the good times he was there and the
[1:01:51] bad times he was there in the
[1:01:52] in the times where he saw there's no way
[1:01:55] out he was there
[1:01:58] hallelujah he never left us alone
[1:02:01] amen because remember he's going to
[1:02:03] carry us
[1:02:05] all the way and when we step on the
[1:02:07] other shore
[1:02:09] we'll say lord you got me here i
[1:02:11] probably i feel like i say it all the
[1:02:12] time but this
[1:02:13] to me it's just how i feel about my
[1:02:15] christian journey lord you got me here
[1:02:17] you got me here i can't boast any any
[1:02:20] any achievement
[1:02:21] any ability of my own in spite of me you
[1:02:23] got me here
[1:02:24] you know sometimes we think the devil's
[1:02:26] against us actually our own selves can
[1:02:27] be against is pretty good too
[1:02:29] you know brother brahm said the biggest
[1:02:30] enemy he had was william branham
[1:02:32] if he can just get him out of the way
[1:02:33] then god can do things william branham
[1:02:35] knows nothing about
[1:02:36] amen and that's very even more so i feel
[1:02:39] for myself
[1:02:39] i just get myself out of the way then
[1:02:41] the lord can work but you know even in
[1:02:43] spite of me
[1:02:45] we're going to make this journey we're
[1:02:47] going to make this journey
[1:02:48] hallelujah and we will look back if you
[1:02:50] know i don't know what memories we will
[1:02:52] still
[1:02:53] i have on the other side i believe we
[1:02:55] will still remember when we got
[1:02:57] saved because we will still know him he
[1:03:00] is our redeemer he redeemed us we will
[1:03:02] still know him as a savior
[1:03:03] because he's not just going to blank our
[1:03:05] minds when we're on the other side and
[1:03:06] then we have no
[1:03:07] remembrance of this because what why
[1:03:09] then would we have to go through all
[1:03:11] these things
[1:03:12] the form character and that he wants to
[1:03:14] build a relationship in our lives
[1:03:17] but you know can we just have the
[1:03:19] musicians actually we'll just sing a
[1:03:21] song but you know
[1:03:23] in spite of me he's going to get me
[1:03:25] there he promised
[1:03:27] if he promised me something he's gonna
[1:03:29] fulfill it
[1:03:30] amen so i don't know how
[1:03:33] you know i often think what is the first
[1:03:35] thing i'm gonna say
[1:03:37] hallelujah have you thought about that
[1:03:38] the first five minutes in heaven
[1:03:40] what's it gonna be like hallelujah
[1:03:44] you know maybe we won't be able to say
[1:03:47] anything
[1:03:47] just be too awesome all the all the all
[1:03:50] the brief tastes of you know because
[1:03:52] remember if you think of heaven as the
[1:03:53] great big ocean
[1:03:55] it's like we just experienced just a
[1:03:56] trickle of a stream
[1:03:58] and it's glorious even now but you know
[1:04:00] how about when we're really in the
[1:04:01] presence living in that great ocean if i
[1:04:03] can put it that way
[1:04:04] amen yeah i think maybe we'll be
[1:04:06] speechless but i think heaven will be a
[1:04:08] noisy place too
[1:04:09] and we can't get deaf well i'd say can
[1:04:11] you keep that down you're hitting my
[1:04:12] ears because you can't get
[1:04:14] you can't get paid but you know i think
[1:04:16] i'll be a bit speechless but i
[1:04:18] i say lord the journey is worth it you
[1:04:21] gripped me by your word
[1:04:23] harley just like that gripped by the
[1:04:24] star and they journey to find christ
[1:04:26] there
[1:04:27] we've been gripped by a message
[1:04:29] hallelujah and he's
[1:04:30] drawing us and carrying us through and
[1:04:33] then one day we will be there
[1:04:36] hallelujah may 2021
[1:04:40] can it be now i say lord let's help us
[1:04:43] give us a burden for the lost
[1:04:46] hallelujah if we can just help someone
