[24:49] so acts 2 and 1
[24:51] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[24:53] come
[24:54] they were all with one accord in one
[24:56] place and suddenly there came a sound
[24:58] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[25:00] and it filled all the house where they
[25:02] were sitting and there appeared unto
[25:04] them cloven tongues like as a fire and
[25:06] it set upon each of them and they were
[25:08] filled or they were all filled with the
[25:10] holy ghost and began to speak with other
[25:13] tongues as the spirit gave them
[25:14] utterance and they were dwelling at
[25:16] jerusalem jews devout men out of every
[25:18] nation under heaven now when this was
[25:20] noised abroad the multitude came
[25:22] together and were confounded because
[25:24] that every man heard them speak in his
[25:26] own language and they were all amazed
[25:28] and marveled saying one to another
[25:30] behold are not all these which speak
[25:32] galileans
[25:33] and how
[25:35] here we every man in his own tongue when
[25:37] we were born corinthians and medes and
[25:40] elamites and dwellers in mesopotamia and
[25:43] in
[25:44] judea and cappadisia and pontius and
[25:47] asia
[25:49] figure and pamphlet in egypt and in the
[25:52] parts of libya about cyrene and
[25:54] strangers of rome jews and proselytes
[25:56] cretes and arabians we do hear them
[25:59] speak in our own tongues the wonderful
[26:01] works of god and they were all amazed
[26:03] and were in doubt saying one to another
[26:05] what meanest this
[26:07] others mocking said these men are full
[26:09] of new wine
[26:11] i mean we're just going to go to acts
[26:13] chapter 10
[26:15] and we are going to read
[26:18] from verse 1 as well
[26:23] i mean so it says here
[26:25] there was a certain man in caesarea
[26:27] called cornelius a centurion of the band
[26:30] called the italian band a devout man and
[26:33] one that fed god with all this house
[26:36] which gave much arms to the people and
[26:38] prayed to god always
[26:40] he saw in a vision evidently about the
[26:42] ninth hour of the day an angel of god
[26:45] come to him and saying unto him
[26:47] cornelius and when he looked on him he
[26:49] was afraid and said what is it lord and
[26:51] he said unto him thy prayers and thy
[26:53] arms that come up from memorial before
[26:55] god
[26:56] and now send me to joppa and call for
[26:58] one simon whose surname is peter he
[27:02] lodges with one simon a tanner whose
[27:05] house is by the seaside he shall tell
[27:07] thee what thou ought us
[27:09] to do
[27:11] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[27:12] his word let's just bow heads in a word
[27:14] of prayer

[28:02] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[28:04] have your seats
[28:06] tonight and i would like to if i could
[28:08] title this i'd like to talk about
[28:10] a day of visitation
[28:13] now
[28:14] we read here of cornelius we read their
[28:16] first in the book of acts of the of the
[28:18] uh day of pentecost uh it says that they
[28:20] are all gathered there in the upper room
[28:23] and and it said now when the prince of
[28:24] lord fill that house it filled them and
[28:26] then they were you know you know when it
[28:28] was noised abroad all the people they
[28:30] saw the manifestation of it uh and they
[28:32] thought maybe you know these people are
[28:34] drunk with new wine but the thing is the
[28:36] those in the upper room they are
[28:37] prepared for a visitation and it's got
[28:40] to be the same thing with you and i you
[28:42] know even in this time where it feels is
[28:44] you know as i said before it feels like
[28:45] we've kind of gone back around and time
[28:48] again and we're back where we had an
[28:49] original lockdown but you know god is
[28:52] still god and um i just want to
[28:53] encourage you tonight you know we need
[28:55] to be prepared for a visitation of the
[28:57] lord you know we gather together even we
[29:00] are you know part of why we're believers
[29:02] you know we should expect god to visit
[29:04] us amen we should expect angels to visit
[29:07] our house and we know it will be a true
[29:09] angel of the lord because it always
[29:11] point us back into the word but here we
[29:13] have this man cornelius where god would
[29:16] describe him as a as a devout man
[29:20] a man who would
[29:22] you know a man who feared god and with
[29:24] all this house gave much arms to the
[29:26] people and prayed to god always now here
[29:29] is god god was preparing cornelius
[29:32] because god was going to open the door
[29:35] to the gentiles where you know the day
[29:37] of pentecost yo god filled was mainly a
[29:39] jewish church then we know peter i mean
[29:41] i mean philip in acts chapter eight he
[29:43] went to preach to the samaritans which
[29:45] are the half jew and gentile but then we
[29:48] know that the
[29:49] the the gospel was going to go to every
[29:51] creature so i was going to go to the
[29:52] gentiles as well so here was god was
[29:55] preparing a man for a visitation now
[29:57] cornelius he didn't really know well he
[29:59] had no idea this was going to happen to
[30:01] him i you know maybe he would pray
[30:03] this time every day being a devout man
[30:06] you know but god would god would send
[30:08] his angel there because god was going to
[30:10] use cornelius in his household as the
[30:12] first part of the gentile bride in that
[30:15] age now
[30:16] if we look at the character of the man
[30:18] now i want to talk about preparing for a
[30:20] visitation amen because we want to
[30:22] prepare for a visitation don't we you
[30:24] know we want to you know i pray that we
[30:26] desire that god would come visit us in
[30:28] our homes where we are that even though
[30:30] we are a part yet we are you know god is
[30:32] with us and you know we can expect god
[30:34] to move in our homes can we not you know
[30:36] it's not just in the four walls of
[30:38] church where god lives you know it's not
[30:40] just you know when we're gathered in a
[30:41] prayer meeting but you know it's where
[30:42] you know it's it's it's he said he'd
[30:44] never leave us nor forsake us so we
[30:46] should expect god to come and fill our
[30:48] houses and fill our beings and take over
[30:50] our prayer lives and take over our lives
[30:52] and come and fill us you know time and
[30:54] time again you know that should be our
[30:56] hearts desire and it should be our
[30:58] expectation because our god is a
[30:59] supernatural god you know we can't
[31:02] expect our children just to come in just
[31:04] by conforming to the message you know
[31:06] and becoming good message believers you
[31:08] know the only way that they can really
[31:09] get saved is god meets them you know god
[31:12] fills him with the holy ghost god the
[31:13] goodness of god leads them to repentance
[31:15] that's you know that's that's what we
[31:17] need
[31:18] can we all have an amen or a hand away
[31:20] you know who's with me who wants a
[31:22] visitation of the lord you know you can
[31:23] have an angel visit your house yeah we
[31:26] know that the visitation of angels
[31:28] didn't stop after the book of acts was
[31:30] finished being written but you know
[31:31] angels still visit god's children even
[31:34] today
[31:35] amen so this word uh devout here in the
[31:38] greek speaking of cornelius notice when
[31:41] luke is inspired to write the book of
[31:43] acts it's the holy ghost through through
[31:45] lucas recording the acts of the holy
[31:47] ghost of that age that he would describe
[31:50] cornelius as a devout man now it doesn't
[31:52] say how rich he was how big his house
[31:54] was you know any of those things but he
[31:56] was devout now to me this is this is
[31:58] speaking of the condition of his heart
[32:00] where you know this word devout or
[32:04] rather this you know devout means he's
[32:05] very consecrated to the lord but he's
[32:07] one that feared god now this this
[32:10] fearing god
[32:12] isn't one who's terrified
[32:14] of god
[32:15] but it's one that stands in aurov or or
[32:19] one that reverences
[32:21] and to have reverence means have deep
[32:23] respect so he was he was an or of the
[32:26] god that had become his god he was a
[32:28] gentile he was a proselyte to the jewish
[32:30] religion but but he he had a real or
[32:33] whatever maybe someone would speak of
[32:35] you know jehovah or adonai or el shaddai
[32:39] or you know one of the titles of god
[32:41] from the old testament you know he'd
[32:42] have real awe
[32:43] in his heart about how great is our god
[32:46] and how merciful he is and you know
[32:48] because he's the creator of heavens and
[32:49] earth and he was one who who would pray
[32:52] all way the scripture would say so this
[32:54] is this is how god is is recording of
[32:57] this gentile now i want to just say that
[33:00] when i talk about he was a devout man
[33:02] and he any and he prayed all way and you
[33:04] know
[33:05] please don't get in your mind that it's
[33:06] your good works that will cause god to
[33:08] come upon the scene but it's a condition
[33:10] of a believer's heart and the desire
[33:12] that we have will bring him on the scene
[33:14] so you know the scripture would tell us
[33:16] in first thessalonians 5 the apostle
[33:19] paul tells the believers to rejoice ever
[33:21] more this is from verse 16. pray without
[33:24] ceasing in everything give thanks for
[33:27] this is the will of god can uh in christ
[33:29] jesus concerning you quench not the
[33:32] spirit despise not prophet prophesying
[33:34] prove all things hold fast to that which
[33:37] is good and abstain from all appearance
[33:41] of evil so
[33:42] when it talks about praying all way that
[33:45] doesn't i mean pray without ceasing that
[33:46] doesn't mean that we should be on our
[33:48] knees 24 7 but you know we should be
[33:50] praying in our hearts of the lord as as
[33:52] a scripture would say in ephesians we
[33:54] should sing spiritual songs and so
[33:56] psalms in our heart unto the lord who's
[33:58] with me tonight
[34:00] amen we should have a we should have a
[34:01] um atmosphere around us
[34:04] you know where the lord feels welcome to
[34:06] draw near you know
[34:08] with all my heart i want god to walk
[34:09] with me
[34:11] right i don't just want to have a head
[34:13] knowledge of the lord jesus my desire is
[34:16] that god would live with me right that's
[34:18] why he died on calvary to break any
[34:21] distance between us and god you know
[34:22] that he and man would become one so you
[34:25] and him would become one where he would
[34:27] dwell in you by the holy ghost amen his
[34:30] very own spirit his own life will come
[34:32] and dwell in the believer and you know
[34:34] it's really
[34:35] what we talk about
[34:37] what we fellowship on can bring god
[34:39] close or can grieve him away
[34:42] you know we can grieve the lord away by
[34:44] by gossip and backbiting and and
[34:46] political uh talk you know in the church
[34:49] and what i mean by political talk is you
[34:51] know you talk good you know bad about
[34:52] someone talk good about someone else and
[34:55] you know in order to to change people's
[34:57] perception in a
[34:58] you know the human way but you know we
[35:00] don't want to belittle one another or
[35:02] you know
[35:03] the lord is grieved by that i believe
[35:04] he's not pleased when we when we murder
[35:06] each other's reputation you know we
[35:08] don't want to you know fall into that
[35:10] kind of bracket but but talking about
[35:12] the law brings them close and that's
[35:14] what i really want to um talk about just
[35:16] for next few moments you know the two on
[35:19] the way to emmaus
[35:21] in luke chapter 24. now when brother
[35:23] branham he preaches two messages at the
[35:25] end of his ministry one is uh uh
[35:28] and they're both called mon events to
[35:30] make clear by prophecy now who's heard
[35:32] that one
[35:33] right so he goes to luke chapter 24
[35:35] and he he he he reads the scripture from
[35:38] the two on the way to emmaus and he is
[35:41] going to preach from that and and he's
[35:43] going to say the condition that the
[35:45] people were in just after the
[35:48] resurrection there is is these monuments
[35:50] you see around us
[35:52] made clear by luke chapter 24 which is a
[35:54] prophecy
[35:56] right so so luke 24 is a prophecy and
[35:59] it's actually making the day we live in
[36:01] clear
[36:02] this is a very great uh confusing time
[36:05] isn't it for the world you know everyone
[36:07] has an opinion everyone says lots of
[36:09] things about pretty much everything and
[36:12] you know but but but the but the lord
[36:13] seemed to vindicate a prophet to the
[36:15] earth on this day to tell us that these
[36:18] modern events 2021
[36:20] are made clear by luke chapter 24. now
[36:24] for the believer it is very clear
[36:26] because the whole purpose of the lord
[36:29] walking with the two on the way to
[36:30] emmaus is that he would open the
[36:33] scripture to them of all the prophecies
[36:36] that he had just fulfilled in their day
[36:39] and then he went with them into the
[36:41] house
[36:42] and he did something he did before he
[36:44] was crucified which he took the bread
[36:46] and he broke it and the scripture says
[36:48] when he did that and he handed it to the
[36:50] disciples their eyes came open and they
[36:52] realized that it was the lord had you
[36:54] know he had raised he has risen from the
[36:56] dead
[36:57] and then they said did not our hearts
[36:59] burn within us as
[37:01] he you know as we spoke along the way so
[37:04] he spent about six hours
[37:07] from when he started walking with them
[37:10] and they they were sad you know but the
[37:12] thing is they were talking about what
[37:14] the lord had done in their day
[37:18] and talking about what the lord had done
[37:19] in the day drew him near and that's what
[37:22] we want is it not we want the lord to
[37:23] draw near you know there'll be more than
[37:26] stories or more than just doctrine yeah
[37:27] but the lord himself would draw near and
[37:30] actually enter into our conversation and
[37:32] begin to guide us into the scripture so
[37:34] there he was you know maybe caught yeah
[37:36] you know maybe cleopas or maybe you know
[37:38] yours friend you know they would begin
[37:40] to relate of maybe maybe they related
[37:42] when the disciples were on the sea of
[37:43] galilee you know and the storm was there
[37:45] and ten thousand devils got in that
[37:47] storm and swore they'd drown the
[37:48] disciples you know and jesus and um you
[37:51] know the disciples they were going to
[37:53] drown and they wake up the master say
[37:55] master don't you care that we perishing
[37:57] you know the lord just got up and he and
[37:59] he just spoke peace be still to the wind
[38:01] and waves and they obeyed him they the
[38:03] yo-yo then they went calm or maybe they
[38:05] begin to talk about you know how how
[38:07] they just crossed the sea there then
[38:08] legion came out of the tombs and fell
[38:10] down at jesus's feet and you know the
[38:12] lord cast that legion of demons out of
[38:15] that man and they because the devil's
[38:17] got to find a host to to to work through
[38:20] you know that the law consented that
[38:21] they would you know go into the swan
[38:23] because they wanted to go into something
[38:24] to manifest themselves but those swine
[38:26] ran into the sea and they drowned
[38:28] themselves they didn't want to be
[38:29] possessed by any evil spirit you know or
[38:31] maybe they talked about when jesus not
[38:33] that long before you know before his
[38:35] crucifixion you know rode triumphantly
[38:38] on a back of a donkey fulfilling the
[38:40] prophecy of isaiah you know going up
[38:42] there everyone's crying hosanna hosanna
[38:44] to the son of david and or maybe maybe
[38:46] they'd relate about when he healed the
[38:48] lepers or opened the eyes of the blind
[38:50] man or you know whatever incredible
[38:52] things he did you know they were they
[38:54] were talking about everything he did
[38:57] maybe their favorite one was you know
[38:58] when lazarus was you know dead four days
[39:01] in the tomb and you know the lord walked
[39:03] to his tomb and in his humanity he wept
[39:05] because he felt you know sad that his
[39:07] friend had died and mary martha were
[39:09] crying because he had compassion upon
[39:10] people's life but but then he pushed
[39:13] back his little shoulders and cried out
[39:14] with a loud voice lazarus come forth and
[39:17] you know the prophet told us if he did
[39:18] not call lazarus by name there would
[39:20] have been a general resurrection because
[39:22] he is the resurrection and the life and
[39:24] you know you know maybe that would have
[39:25] been their favorite one and you know
[39:26] they would be relating their favorite
[39:29] testimonies of what the lord had done
[39:32] in their day you know it's the same
[39:33] thing you know even if we could parallel
[39:35] today you know you begin to talk about
[39:37] what god has done in our day
[39:40] and you know i'm not just even talking
[39:41] about you know we can talk about the
[39:43] testimony of you know what god did
[39:45] through the prophet you know raising the
[39:47] dead healing the sick you know mass
[39:49] healings there in durban south africa
[39:51] many places around the world storm being
[39:53] spoken out of existence the soul coming
[39:54] into his hand the word coming open you
[39:56] know all those things but then we could
[39:58] even bring it you know not just 60 years
[40:00] ago but bring it into 2021. you know how
[40:03] he's how he's healed the second helmets
[40:04] cast out the devil in helmets people
[40:06] have been transformed by the holy ghost
[40:08] yo this message is put on flesh you know
[40:11] and and and you and i you know we can
[40:13] talk about those kind of testimonies and
[40:15] you'll find when you begin to talk about
[40:16] those kind of testimonies you know of
[40:18] what god has done where the word becomes
[40:20] living you know that's when he draws
[40:22] there the atmosphere begins to change
[40:25] who knows what i'm talking about
[40:27] who wants more of that
[40:29] you know we can't put a limit on god we
[40:31] can't you know he doesn't have a cap
[40:33] man has tried to box him for for
[40:36] you know ever since adam and eve in the
[40:38] garden you know man has tried to box god
[40:40] but you we can't box god you know he
[40:43] will not be boxed man tries to put him
[40:44] in a denominational box and say this is
[40:46] what god is and that's it god just steps
[40:48] out of the box and works on with someone
[40:50] else you know i don't want him to work
[40:51] on with someone else i said lord come
[40:53] and live in our lives come and manifest
[40:55] your word through your you know you know
[40:57] through your people in this end time
[40:59] hallelujah
[41:01] amen but then so he drew now
[41:04] and he went with them
[41:06] and he opened the scripture
[41:09] now cornelius
[41:11] if we can go back to him no actually
[41:13] rather i'll say this
[41:14] when you prepare when people prepare for
[41:17] a visitation
[41:19] they go through normally a lot of work
[41:22] because it's on their heart
[41:24] they won't they want the visitor to feel
[41:26] welcome
[41:28] right who's with me you want your
[41:29] visitors to feel welcome you invite
[41:31] someone you don't want them to feel
[41:33] unwelcome in your house you want them to
[41:35] feel welcome that they'll want to come
[41:37] back again
[41:38] so you know maybe you'll clean up the
[41:40] house you know christine will you know
[41:41] cook up a storm and you know we'll do
[41:43] different things because we want
[41:44] whoever's walking through our front door
[41:46] we want them to feel welcome
[41:49] now brother branham wood would speak
[41:52] about
[41:53] if
[41:53] you know he would he would put out
[41:55] different characters and say you know
[41:57] imagine if if the queen of england came
[41:59] to your house and he's talking to
[42:01] americans here in america he said even
[42:03] though she is not the queen over us yet
[42:06] because she's such a fine woman you know
[42:07] would be so thrilled if she decided to
[42:10] come to our house and you know imagine
[42:13] if the queen did come to our house you
[42:14] know we'd clean up we would want to put
[42:16] on a good impression you know brother
[42:18] bram says if she came to your house you
[42:20] know and she saw something maybe a
[42:21] favorite painting or something that's
[42:23] nice you know and she said oh could i uh
[42:25] have that you know that's very nice
[42:27] thing you know you'd be so honored to
[42:28] give it to her why because because you
[42:31] know it was such a privilege to have her
[42:33] come and the reason that you know that
[42:36] happens is because people would prepare
[42:39] for the visitation now
[42:41] i'm not talking about when i talk about
[42:43] preparing for a visitation of the lord
[42:46] i'm talking about outward things sure
[42:49] because you know it is how we you know
[42:51] what's on the inside should manifest on
[42:53] the outside
[42:54] right
[42:55] who's with me
[42:57] but the thing is some people can have it
[42:59] on the outside but nothing on the inside
[43:02] and it's really the condition of the
[43:04] heart
[43:05] that that
[43:06] sure it will manifest on the outside
[43:09] but it's really the condition of the
[43:11] heart
[43:12] and the receive how how can receive a
[43:15] visitor how i can receive the lord jesus
[43:17] you know we want to have tender hearts
[43:20] don't we we want to be flexible to his
[43:22] word you know
[43:23] this this world is very hard-hearted
[43:27] we've been told to be kind in this day
[43:30] it's been repeated over and over again
[43:32] and i can just ask the question why do
[43:34] we need to be reminded to be kind
[43:37] because people need to be reminded to be
[43:39] kind
[43:40] because because iniquity has abounded
[43:43] the love of many has wax cold
[43:46] and there's very little love left in the
[43:48] world
[43:49] sadly
[43:51] but in order to really make a visitor
[43:53] feel welcome
[43:56] it's really our heart's condition
[44:00] that makes him feel welcome
[44:02] now brother brown would say you know the
[44:04] queen comes to your house you know you
[44:06] invite her and you make a welcome
[44:08] uh the president at that time was dwight
[44:10] eisenhower it'd be such an honor to have
[44:11] the president of america come to your
[44:13] house you'd make him feel so welcome but
[44:15] he says but jesus comes
[44:17] and people turn them away
[44:20] but i believe i'm looking at a people
[44:23] who don't turn him away
[44:24] i believe i'm looking at a people who
[44:26] want him in their house that that he is
[44:29] the most precious visitor that they
[44:31] could ever have in their entire life
[44:33] where it doesn't matter if you know it
[44:34] doesn't matter if they're not even known
[44:36] on the footnotes of history now i'm just
[44:37] talking about myself it doesn't even
[44:39] matter if they're not even remembered by
[44:40] anyone but as long as jesus visited them
[44:44] hallelujah and was made welcome to me
[44:47] that's the most precious thing i want
[44:49] jesus to be welcome
[44:50] in my house now
[44:53] we
[44:54] you say well do we really need
[44:56] a visitation like that do we really need
[44:58] a visitation like the angel lord coming
[45:00] to cornelius you know we have the holy
[45:02] ghost we don't need angels to come visit
[45:04] us well i just say this you know who
[45:06] believes the apostle paul had the holy
[45:08] ghost
[45:10] anyone yep
[45:11] good you know
[45:12] he would say when when when he was on
[45:15] the ship and it was about to be
[45:16] shipwrecked and you know the storm would
[45:19] have been gone for about 14 days and you
[45:20] know he came out you know out of his
[45:22] cabin he'd been praying and and he told
[45:25] the captain he told the crew he told
[45:27] everyone he said men be of good chair
[45:30] the angel of the lord whose i am and who
[45:33] i serve came to me this night and said
[45:35] there'll be no loss of life only the
[45:37] ship see the apostle paul had
[45:39] visitations of angels
[45:41] amen
[45:42] peter would be visited by an angel
[45:44] uh in acts chapter 10 just after what we
[45:47] just read
[45:48] so there's visitations of angels there
[45:50] in the old testament we know they're
[45:51] also in the new testament now a
[45:53] visitation of an angel does not stop
[45:56] you know just because we're in this this
[45:58] this era today because jesus christ is
[46:01] the same yesterday today and forever so
[46:04] god can still visit and quite frankly i
[46:07] believe he should still come visit us in
[46:08] that manner where angels can come into
[46:11] your house who wants that who wants that
[46:15] who wants more than just a formal
[46:16] religion and maybe just some nice
[46:18] singing and who wants god to live
[46:20] i mean to do what what only he can do
[46:23] hallelujah so you know
[46:25] i'm not saying that we we are not
[46:28] welcoming to him and we're not inviting
[46:30] to him and you know but but i'm just
[46:32] want to encouraging you you know we can
[46:33] have more
[46:35] you know where brother brown would
[46:36] relate
[46:37] and what what what got me thinking about
[46:40] this was um i just sort of locked down
[46:42] last time and brother john anders was
[46:44] preaching and you know he's preaching
[46:46] about how the angel of the lord can come
[46:47] in
[46:48] and he can visit us he can come into our
[46:50] homes that even though we are alone that
[46:53] we're separated but yet we're together
[46:56] who remembers that okay so maybe we're
[46:57] going down memory
[46:59] you know laying a bit but you know we
[47:00] don't just wanna um you know i pray and
[47:03] yeah i've been thinking about this
[47:04] lockdown for myself is you know there's
[47:05] a saying
[47:07] never waste a good crisis who's heard
[47:09] that one
[47:10] never waste a good crisis
[47:12] right so the world is not wasting this
[47:15] crisis
[47:16] and you can say well people say it's
[47:18] engineered not engineered whatever
[47:19] whatever you know in my opinion well not
[47:22] in my opinion but you know god is in
[47:23] control of everything who believes that
[47:26] so god has allowed this to happen
[47:27] whether you know what we like it or not
[47:30] you know
[47:31] it's nice to go to work not having to
[47:33] wear a mask you know i had to wear a
[47:35] mask all day today you know it keeps you
[47:38] a bit warm but it's not very nice you
[47:39] know my glasses fog up and looks like
[47:41] i'm kind of driving through the rain you
[47:43] know it's hard but you've got to adjust
[47:44] things and you know and your people you
[47:46] know anyway you just can't go anywhere
[47:48] you want and i know the girls are
[47:50] enjoying it because you know today was
[47:51] like a holiday but um you know
[47:54] there's a lot of things that i wish we
[47:55] weren't locked down in this way of
[47:57] course there's sickness and things going
[47:58] on and families are separated and things
[48:00] but you know however we feel about
[48:03] what's happened
[48:04] the lord has allowed this to happen
[48:06] he's in control
[48:08] and to me
[48:09] the world is looking how can we you know
[48:11] benefit from this crisis and do
[48:12] different things but we should benefit
[48:14] from this crisis we should benefit
[48:16] spiritually from this lockdown where
[48:19] this lockdown is another opportunity if
[48:22] you look at it it's another opportunity
[48:23] to drill closer to god to lay aside the
[48:26] busyness of life
[48:28] praise the lord i mean because we're
[48:30] locked down we can't get well some of us
[48:32] can go places but you know after you go
[48:34] to the supermarket about 20 times it
[48:35] kind of gets a bit redundant you know so
[48:37] it kind of is not too far to go
[48:40] so we should take advantage of this
[48:42] lockdown
[48:44] and draw closer to the lord
[48:46] hallelujah where the lord has allowed us
[48:48] this time
[48:50] that we can get into his word we can
[48:52] spend time in prayer we can come
[48:54] together as families we can rebuild our
[48:57] family altars if they if they're fallen
[48:59] down and if they're there we can we can
[49:01] build them bigger
[49:02] right we can spend time in prayer we can
[49:05] seek the lord
[49:06] out of thanksgiving because he's so what
[49:08] who wants him to draw near you know
[49:10] some people think prayer is a effort or
[49:12] it's a you know this is works to try and
[49:14] get him to come no i love him
[49:16] you know i want to be in his presence
[49:18] more and more i want him to live i want
[49:20] him to you know come and live through us
[49:21] and be so much more real and be real to
[49:24] my family and you know
[49:26] you know what i mean who's with me
[49:28] right that's what we want so there's an
[49:30] opportunity
[49:32] this is a perfect opportunity even
[49:34] though it may be just for a few days you
[49:36] know it's an opportunity to draw closer
[49:38] to the lord
[49:40] to me that's exciting because the lord
[49:43] has allowed this
[49:44] amen and it's all all things work
[49:47] together for good
[49:48] for those that love god and are called
[49:50] according to his purpose
[49:53] am i looking at some of those people
[49:55] praise the lord
[49:57] amen so now
[50:00] brother brown would speak and this is
[50:01] sorry i'm going back to where i was
[50:02] mentioning brother john anders as as as
[50:05] he would he would take a testimony and
[50:07] and he'd speak about two women
[50:10] who were prayed for
[50:12] one had a goiter and i think one had a
[50:14] cancer or something in her stomach or
[50:16] something like that you know and and and
[50:18] they went through the prayer line
[50:20] and the lord through the prophet
[50:22] discerned what was wrong with them
[50:23] prayed for them
[50:24] and the lord said thus saith the lord
[50:26] you're healed
[50:28] now they went off
[50:29] and they went rejoicing
[50:31] knowing that the lord had healed them
[50:35] it hadn't physically manifested yet but
[50:37] they believed that god had spoken to
[50:39] them saying that they're healed and you
[50:40] say well is that scripturally true well
[50:42] the bible says by
[50:44] his stripes we were healed
[50:47] right it's already a finished work
[50:49] so they went on their way they they were
[50:51] neighbors they were living kind of close
[50:52] to each other and and they went
[50:55] rejoicing knowing that the lord had
[50:58] given them a word of promise
[51:00] and now they are walking in faith
[51:02] knowing that it was going to be
[51:04] fulfilled now
[51:05] we are living in an hour where the word
[51:08] the scriptures are going to be fulfilled
[51:11] right all scripture will be fulfilled we
[51:13] know that but we're living in a time
[51:15] where a lot of scriptures that have been
[51:17] laying it seems dormant for thousands of
[51:20] years or hundreds of years are gonna be
[51:22] fulfilled
[51:24] we know the prime one that we are
[51:26] looking for is the dead in christ to
[51:27] rise first first thessalonians chapter
[51:30] four you know the apostle paul would say
[51:32] in corinthians we shall not all sleep
[51:34] but we all shall be changed and that
[51:36] promise has been sitting there in the
[51:37] scripture you can say has been circling
[51:39] the earth until the time of fulfillment
[51:42] now
[51:43] when there is a time of fulfillment
[51:44] that's when you see god begin to pour
[51:46] his spirit out
[51:48] you know and there's visitations of
[51:50] angels there's a supernatural
[51:52] move of god because he's there to
[51:54] fulfill his word you know you can take
[51:55] when jesus first came to the earth you
[51:57] know there was and your angelic
[51:59] visitation to mary there was also to
[52:01] zechariah which was john's father he was
[52:03] there in the temple dirt you know you
[52:05] know waving the incense before the lord
[52:07] and you know the angel of petum said
[52:09] you're going to have the you know you're
[52:11] going to have the son who's going to be
[52:12] the voice of one crying in the
[52:14] wilderness you know the angel came to
[52:15] mary gabriel came to mary and said
[52:17] you're going to be with child by the
[52:18] holy ghost and you know you know then
[52:20] that same angel came and visited um
[52:23] joseph in a dream because he was minded
[52:25] to put mary away privately after this
[52:27] happened and you know there's a lot of
[52:28] supernatural going on and then even even
[52:31] the night of jesus birth you know
[52:32] there's an angelic visitation to the
[52:34] shepherds and you're the star rose in
[52:36] the east and the wise men followed it to
[52:38] bethlehem and you know many many
[52:40] supernatural things are happening why
[52:41] because of scripture
[52:43] many scriptures that had laid there for
[52:45] for you know isaiah would
[52:47] you would prophesy a virgin shall
[52:49] conceive and that lay in the scriptures
[52:51] for about 800 odd years until a time of
[52:55] fulfillment where a predestinated womb
[52:58] was upon the earth who was married who
[53:00] was there to fulfill that promise and
[53:03] you know
[53:04] and then finally you know maybe there
[53:06] would have been hundreds of of of you
[53:08] know of of virgin girls whose fathers
[53:11] when they heard isaiah prophesy a virgin
[53:13] shall conceive that say my daughter's
[53:15] going to be it but when god spoke that
[53:18] through isaiah he knew exactly who was
[53:19] going to fulfill it and that was mary
[53:21] herself are you all following me tonight
[53:24] amen so you know just like peter james
[53:26] and john they were they were they were
[53:28] part of prophecy you know they were part
[53:30] of the prophecy of joel where the lord
[53:32] said that he'd pour his spirit out upon
[53:34] all flesh
[53:35] hallelujah where whereas handmaids as
[53:37] young men will prophesy old men will
[53:39] dream dreams you know the fulfillment of
[53:40] joel chapter two and so those in the
[53:43] upper room were the first part of that
[53:45] fulfillment of that prophecy and god
[53:47] knew the ones who'd be in the upper room
[53:50] so there's a mighty outpouring of the
[53:52] supernatural during that time where a
[53:54] lot of scriptures were fulfilled you
[53:56] know we can even take the you know last
[53:58] few hours of jesus life
[54:01] and he fulfilled many many scriptures
[54:03] very very quickly just in that last
[54:05] portion of his life what was happening
[54:07] prophecy was becoming history but when
[54:11] those prophecies were becoming history
[54:13] there were predestinated people upon the
[54:15] earth to fulfill
[54:17] that prophecy now what happened is the
[54:20] lord would come the angel lord would
[54:22] come
[54:23] and manifest
[54:24] to you know make those promises live to
[54:27] those who ordained to that promise right
[54:31] so here we are in the end time we're
[54:34] looking for the dead in christ to rise
[54:36] where we're already in the process of
[54:38] the rapture cycle because it says in
[54:40] first thessalonians chapter 4 the lord
[54:42] himself shall descend with a shout right
[54:45] and a vindicated prophet said on this
[54:47] day said the shout the message is the
[54:49] shout right so he's already started the
[54:51] rapture process the next says the voice
[54:54] of the archangel which is the life of
[54:56] god will come into maturity in a people
[54:58] and that life will call forth the dead
[55:00] in christ right and then we which are
[55:02] alive and remain will be caught up with
[55:04] them to meet the lord in the air that's
[55:05] the final part of that you know
[55:07] fulfillment of that prophecy but you see
[55:09] when when when the apostle paul was
[55:12] inspired
[55:13] and and he would tell the thessalonians
[55:15] the lord himself shall descend with a
[55:16] shout with the voice of the archangel
[55:18] with the trump of god you know god head
[55:20] on his mind
[55:22] who those people which are alive and
[55:23] remain would be to fulfill that and
[55:26] those who are going to be dead in christ
[55:27] which will fulfill that part of that
[55:29] right so now what happens is god sends
[55:32] the angel of the lord he comes in
[55:34] angelic form to fulfill the word to a
[55:37] predestinated seed
[55:39] hallelujah so just as he came to mary
[55:42] that the virgin shall conceive so that
[55:44] part of the scripture would be fulfilled
[55:46] or to elizabeth and zechariah that the
[55:48] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[55:50] john the baptist would be born that part
[55:52] of the scripture would be fulfilled or
[55:54] you know he would he would reveal
[55:55] himself to the shepherds because jesus
[55:57] would be born in bethlehem that part
[55:59] would be fulfilled or even even where
[56:01] balaam would prophesied that a star
[56:03] would rise out of jacob and the wise men
[56:06] would see that in the uh um east and
[56:08] follow that star to the west of
[56:09] bethlehem you know he knew that they
[56:11] would be doing that you know he knew
[56:13] those who would be there to fulfill the
[56:15] scriptures now the angel lord is present
[56:19] to manifest the promise to the people so
[56:22] i'm kind of laboring this because i just
[56:24] want you to know we're living under a
[56:25] promise
[56:26] right we're not just here going through
[56:29] life living haphazardly you know in this
[56:32] lockdown not in a lockdown in 2021 going
[56:35] to school having a job having church
[56:38] it's more than that
[56:39] where are people living under a promise
[56:41] and the angel of the lord is here to
[56:44] fulfill that promise to you and i now
[56:47] going back to that testimony where where
[56:49] brother brown prayed for those two women
[56:51] you know and and the lord said thus said
[56:53] the lord you're healed i'm not sure how
[56:55] many days later
[56:57] the the angel lord went through that
[56:59] neighborhood
[57:00] and that woman who had that stomach
[57:02] condition who couldn't who couldn't eat
[57:04] anything
[57:05] she found she said like a cool feeling
[57:08] came over her then suddenly she got real
[57:10] hungry
[57:11] so she took a bite of toast and she
[57:13] found out she wasn't sick because
[57:14] normally she'd eat and she'd just throw
[57:16] up immediately she had that bitter toast
[57:18] and then it and then it went down she
[57:19] was fine then she made herself a full
[57:21] breakfast and she ate it all down she
[57:23] still felt fine and she bringing her
[57:25] thank you she began to rejoice realizing
[57:28] that that the promise that was given to
[57:30] her on the platform where the lord had
[57:32] healed her had now been manifested in
[57:34] her body because she was living under
[57:36] that promise but she was walking in
[57:37] faith knowing that that promise was
[57:39] going to be fulfilled and that's what
[57:40] faith is you know it's going to happen
[57:42] it's not i think it's going to happen or
[57:44] i hope it's going to happen you know
[57:45] it's going to happen it's anchored in
[57:47] here i mean you know it's going to be
[57:48] fulfilled right so then she began to
[57:50] rejoice and then she remembered that her
[57:52] neighbor had been
[57:54] who who had the goiter or whatever it
[57:56] was so i don't have the testimony on me
[57:58] right now but you can go and find it you
[57:59] know
[58:00] she was living just down the road so so
[58:02] this woman who got here with a stomach
[58:04] issue ran to her house and when she got
[58:07] to her house she found this woman it was
[58:08] all gone and she was shaking out a sheet
[58:10] trying to find where it went
[58:12] and what had happened the angel lord had
[58:15] gone through that neighborhood to
[58:17] fulfill the promise that was given to
[58:19] them
[58:20] hallelujah
[58:22] and that's how we should be living
[58:24] friends is looking for the angel of the
[58:26] lord to come fulfill his promise in our
[58:29] lives
[58:30] right we have a promise of a body change
[58:32] but before a body change we have a
[58:34] promise will not leave one hoof behind
[58:36] amen so our children are going to come
[58:39] right our our our relatives are going to
[58:42] come our loved ones are going to come
[58:44] right we should just let our faith go
[58:46] and let god operate our faith to believe
[58:49] that all things are possible
[58:51] you know the you know the believer
[58:53] actually lives by the faith of the son
[58:55] of god
[58:56] and what that means is it's not actually
[58:57] your own faith anymore but it's the
[58:59] faith of jesus christ and a people the
[59:01] apostle paul would say the life i now
[59:03] live in the flesh
[59:05] i live by the faith of the son of god
[59:08] hallelujah so the life the apostle paul
[59:10] lived it wasn't his own faith operating
[59:12] amen you know when he healed the sick or
[59:14] whatever happened it wasn't him doing it
[59:16] it was the lord himself the faith of
[59:19] jesus christ now that same faith created
[59:21] the worlds hallelujah that same faith
[59:24] made all things and that same faith was
[59:26] now dwelling in him and he said the life
[59:28] i now live i live by the faith of the
[59:30] son of god now friends this is how we
[59:32] should be living
[59:33] not by our own human faith guessing i
[59:35] wonder if it's real is it really going
[59:37] to happen is the word really true but no
[59:39] it should be anchored in our hearts amen
[59:41] the word is true the promises are yeah
[59:42] and amen hallelujah that we're not
[59:44] living by our own human faith but we're
[59:46] living by revelation faith the faith of
[59:48] the son of god
[59:50] hallelujah
[59:52] amen
[59:55] hallelujah
[59:57] you know we're here
[1:00:00] to have a mighty visitation
[1:00:02] i believe we're living in the hour of
[1:00:04] visitation
[1:00:06] now
[1:00:07] when i'm talking about a visitation as
[1:00:09] i've said i'm talking more of a personal
[1:00:10] visitation
[1:00:12] i'm talking about the lord coming to you
[1:00:14] and i personally
[1:00:16] and fulfilling his word personally i'm
[1:00:18] not talking about on a dispensational
[1:00:20] level though we know he has come fulfill
[1:00:22] the scripture luke 17 30 the son of man
[1:00:25] has been revealed through the prophet we
[1:00:27] know these things
[1:00:28] right we've seen scripture fulfilled on
[1:00:30] a dispensational level but what about a
[1:00:32] personal level
[1:00:34] because
[1:00:36] if we meditate upon his promises
[1:00:40] if our hearts are all towards him you
[1:00:42] know it's just something when love is
[1:00:44] projected
[1:00:45] right it brings a closeness
[1:00:47] amen when you feel love when you have
[1:00:50] love for your spouse or for your
[1:00:52] children and you begin to express that
[1:00:54] love how you treat them things you say
[1:00:56] it brings a closeness
[1:00:58] right it doesn't bring a separation
[1:01:00] and it's the same thing
[1:01:02] when it comes to us in the lord
[1:01:04] right when divine love is projected
[1:01:06] sovereign grace can take over it brings
[1:01:08] a it brings a closeness and that's what
[1:01:10] i want the lord to do to be real close
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:17] jesus now the devil if i can put it this
[1:01:20] yeah i'll put this way and and in acts
[1:01:22] chapter 19
[1:01:24] there were vagabond jews exorcists
[1:01:27] who took upon them to call over them
[1:01:29] that had evil spirits the name of jesus
[1:01:31] um of the lord jesus saying we're jordy
[1:01:34] by jesus whom paul preacheth
[1:01:36] and there were seven sons of skiva a jew
[1:01:39] and chief of the priests which did so
[1:01:42] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:01:45] jesus i know
[1:01:46] paul i know
[1:01:48] but who are you
[1:01:50] see
[1:01:51] the devil knows
[1:01:52] as i said it's more than just knowing
[1:01:54] what god's done on a dispensational
[1:01:56] level
[1:01:57] because the devil knows what the lord
[1:01:59] has done in the past
[1:02:00] these devils said to the sons of skiva
[1:02:03] jesus i know
[1:02:05] so when you know someone you know what
[1:02:07] they've done you know their works their
[1:02:08] life their ministry so the devil's
[1:02:10] saying
[1:02:12] to to the sons of skiva i know jesus i
[1:02:14] know he cast out my friends
[1:02:17] other devils out of people i know he
[1:02:19] healed the sick cast cast demons out i
[1:02:21] know he
[1:02:22] spoke to the storm i know he died on the
[1:02:25] cross i know he rose again so jesus i
[1:02:28] know paul i know because i've been cast
[1:02:30] out by him many times but who are you
[1:02:33] see it must come down to a personal
[1:02:35] level
[1:02:36] where where we know the lord
[1:02:38] not just you know so the promise is
[1:02:40] personal to us he's a living god to you
[1:02:43] and i not just
[1:02:44] a knowledge on
[1:02:46] a dispensational side now
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:51] the word visitation
[1:02:54] it's it's used a couple of times in the
[1:02:57] new testament and and i'm going to kind
[1:02:59] of wrap up with this
[1:03:00] luke 19 and 44
[1:03:03] it says
[1:03:04] and shall
[1:03:06] i uh this is jesus speaking and shall
[1:03:09] lay thee even with the ground and thy
[1:03:12] children within thee and they shall not
[1:03:15] leave in the one stone upon another
[1:03:17] speaking of jerusalem now because thou
[1:03:19] knewest not the time of thy visitation
[1:03:23] and that same word is used in first
[1:03:25] peter 2 and 12 having your conversation
[1:03:28] honest among the gentiles that whereas
[1:03:31] they speak against you as evildoers
[1:03:33] they may by your good works
[1:03:37] which they shall behold glorify god
[1:03:40] in the day
[1:03:42] of visitation now this word visitation
[1:03:45] it actually means an inspection
[1:03:48] or an investigation
[1:03:50] it means the act by which god looks into
[1:03:52] and searches out the ways the deeds
[1:03:55] the character of men
[1:03:57] in order to adjudge them their lot
[1:04:00] accordingly whether joyous
[1:04:02] or sad
[1:04:03] so a visitation is actually an
[1:04:05] investigation
[1:04:07] and
[1:04:08] this investigation to me
[1:04:10] he's looking for hearts who are here to
[1:04:13] receive him
[1:04:15] when he investigated the scribes and
[1:04:17] pharisees
[1:04:18] he found people that wanted to crucify
[1:04:20] him
[1:04:22] right
[1:04:23] when that same lord jesus went to the
[1:04:25] woman at the well
[1:04:27] though men would say that her character
[1:04:30] was terrible her reputation was ruined
[1:04:34] you know she didn't have any holy
[1:04:36] character like the scribes and pharisees
[1:04:38] when god came when she had her day of
[1:04:40] visitation
[1:04:42] and jesus said you know that god is a
[1:04:45] spirit and they that worship him must
[1:04:46] worship in his spirit and truth then
[1:04:49] then
[1:04:50] the woman said um it says the woman said
[1:04:52] unto him speaking to jesus i know that
[1:04:54] when messiah cometh which is called
[1:04:56] christ
[1:04:57] when he has come he will tell us all
[1:05:00] things and jesus said unto her i that
[1:05:02] speak unto thee am he she didn't
[1:05:05] question it she dropped her water pot
[1:05:07] ran into the city and said this is not
[1:05:08] the very christ so when when when when
[1:05:11] she had a day of visitation though
[1:05:14] outwardly she was lost and undone
[1:05:16] inwardly there was a predestinated seed
[1:05:18] that recognized what god was doing amen
[1:05:20] and that's the kind of character to me
[1:05:22] god is looking for is looking for a
[1:05:24] people that can receive his word that
[1:05:26] will love him more than anything else
[1:05:28] that when he comes their way they will
[1:05:30] give their entire lives to him amen
[1:05:33] that he will live in them
[1:05:36] now
[1:05:37] that's the kind of character he's
[1:05:38] looking for weren't you glad that god
[1:05:40] put something in your heart that when he
[1:05:41] came your way you could receive him
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:47] now
[1:05:49] i just want to say this here
[1:05:51] we
[1:05:52] are living
[1:05:54] in a day where we have been restored
[1:05:56] back to the original faith of the
[1:05:58] fathers
[1:05:59] now when cornelius was there
[1:06:02] and peter came
[1:06:05] we won't read it but you can go later
[1:06:07] but but same time we won't read it
[1:06:10] but peter came to cornelius house and he
[1:06:14] began to preach the resurrection the
[1:06:15] crucifixion the resurrection of our lord
[1:06:17] jesus christ
[1:06:18] and when peter yet spake these words the
[1:06:21] scripture says the holy ghost fell upon
[1:06:23] them
[1:06:25] and and they begin to rejoice praise god
[1:06:27] and speak in tongues and glorify god
[1:06:30] and then peter said
[1:06:32] you know
[1:06:33] seeing this happening he said can we now
[1:06:35] forbid water
[1:06:37] knowing that these have received the
[1:06:38] holy ghost exactly the same way we did
[1:06:40] in the upper room and so they had
[1:06:42] received the holy ghost and they were
[1:06:44] baptized in them lord jesus christ now
[1:06:46] to me this shows that our lord jesus
[1:06:49] when he's received in a true way
[1:06:52] amen he will do the same things he did
[1:06:54] in the beginning now we know our god is
[1:06:57] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:06:59] doesn't change his method he doesn't
[1:07:01] change his ways and we have been
[1:07:03] restored back to the original right what
[1:07:05] what god has established not what man
[1:07:07] changed later down through the ages but
[1:07:09] what god established were being restored
[1:07:11] back to the true word of god now our
[1:07:13] lord jesus is the same and brother brown
[1:07:15] would say it's actually
[1:07:16] a keystone
[1:07:18] to the whole bible that jesus christ is
[1:07:20] the same yesterday today and forever now
[1:07:23] when jesus would would um
[1:07:26] would be there
[1:07:28] and and the multitude were around them
[1:07:31] and and you know they were hungry it was
[1:07:33] it was a few days for them to go and get
[1:07:35] food and things and you know the
[1:07:36] disciples wanted to send them away to
[1:07:38] get food but jesus says what have you
[1:07:40] got and you know maybe andrew one of the
[1:07:42] disciples went past and there was a
[1:07:44] little boy with his lunch and you know
[1:07:46] asked if they could use that to the
[1:07:47] master the little boy gave it to the
[1:07:49] lord jesus and it was just a few fish
[1:07:51] and a few loaves but you know in the
[1:07:53] hands of the master he began to multiply
[1:07:54] it where it was just you know he would
[1:07:57] he would take the bread and break it and
[1:07:59] then again and then produce another
[1:08:01] piece of bread and then break it again
[1:08:03] and keep breaking breaking bread and
[1:08:04] fish and it wasn't just fish it was
[1:08:06] cooked fish and he fed 4 000 men besides
[1:08:08] the woman on top of their children and
[1:08:10] then five thousand and you know in
[1:08:12] another place and what happened is that
[1:08:14] everyone who came to the lord
[1:08:17] got the same kind of bread and the same
[1:08:19] kind of fish
[1:08:21] so they came and got the same kind of
[1:08:23] natural food
[1:08:25] amen it didn't you know he didn't take a
[1:08:27] piece of bread and bless it and break it
[1:08:29] and it turned into a donut
[1:08:31] right or a muffin you know it was
[1:08:33] exactly the same kind of bread or when
[1:08:35] he took the fish i know this sounds
[1:08:37] ridiculous but i'm trying to prove a
[1:08:38] point when he took the fish and he
[1:08:40] blessed it and he break it and it was
[1:08:42] multiplied it didn't turn into a piece
[1:08:44] of steak it didn't turn into a piece of
[1:08:46] broccoli it was still fish it was
[1:08:48] exactly the same right so the people
[1:08:51] what he multiplied to the people they
[1:08:53] received the same
[1:08:55] all of them right
[1:08:57] and what the lord is showing us he's the
[1:08:58] same yesterday today and forever so if
[1:09:00] we come to him he will give us the same
[1:09:03] member he's the bread of life we're not
[1:09:05] coming for loaves and fishes for natural
[1:09:07] natural food this is not why we come to
[1:09:08] the lord but we come for spiritual food
[1:09:11] i mean that our souls can be fed our
[1:09:13] inner man can be fed and so what he's
[1:09:15] showing is because he's the same
[1:09:16] yesterday today and forever is the same
[1:09:19] piece of bread that he gave cornelius in
[1:09:21] his house that the holy ghost fell on
[1:09:23] them and the same piece of bread loaf of
[1:09:25] fish he gave out on the day of pentecost
[1:09:27] where the holy ghost filled them right
[1:09:29] is exactly the same loaf and bread that
[1:09:32] he gives out in this end time i mean to
[1:09:34] give exactly the same kind of experience
[1:09:36] a same kind of visitation where god
[1:09:39] comes down fills the house fills the
[1:09:41] people and transforms our lives that now
[1:09:44] it's no longer us living right now it's
[1:09:46] his word putting on flesh and you and i
[1:09:48] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:09:51] and forever and friends in my opinion he
[1:09:54] is the same he does the same he feels
[1:09:56] what the holy ghost is saying he causes
[1:09:58] people to live according to his word the
[1:10:00] same right he transforms us the same
[1:10:04] amen it may be different kind of
[1:10:05] experiences but the life that's lived
[1:10:07] after the experience is the same kind of
[1:10:09] life because it's a word life it's a
[1:10:11] scriptural life it's not a religious
[1:10:13] life or a nice idea kind of life but
[1:10:16] it's the word putting on flesh in your
[1:10:18] eye so i'm so glad that even though that
[1:10:20] we are
[1:10:21] uh alone but yet together you know we're
[1:10:23] talking on this way of zoom like this
[1:10:26] you know we can invite the lord jesus
[1:10:29] to come into our house
[1:10:31] hallelujah i believe that even in this
[1:10:33] lockdown the angel lord will walk
[1:10:35] through walk through neighborhoods
[1:10:37] amen he'll visit our homes i believe he
[1:10:39] will he will fulfill promises that that
[1:10:42] that we've been living under waiting to
[1:10:44] see them fulfilled he's going to
[1:10:46] manifest that yo now don't doubt
[1:10:48] doubt doesn't help anyone
[1:10:51] right you say i've been through a
[1:10:52] lockdown before and not much happened
[1:10:54] this is a different season
[1:10:56] this is a different hour this is 2021.
[1:11:00] 2020 is in the past
[1:11:02] this is another opportunity
[1:11:05] hallelujah
[1:11:06] that we would come all together
[1:11:09] maybe you don't talk too much in your
[1:11:10] house you can break down those walls
[1:11:13] amen you can actually come together as a
[1:11:15] family
[1:11:16] you can pray together you can have god
[1:11:18] come and visit you in a supernatural way
[1:11:20] and just take over your life like never
[1:11:22] before
[1:11:23] hallelujah
[1:11:25] amen where he can break to you the same
[1:11:27] experience that cornelius and those in
[1:11:28] his house had amen because he's the same
[1:11:31] today
[1:11:32] as he was back then
[1:11:34] amen i believe it
[1:11:36] hallelujah so
[1:11:38] who wants the lord to visit them in a
[1:11:39] supernatural way
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:44] so
[1:11:45] we're going to pray
[1:11:48] and then i'm going to pass the service
[1:11:49] over to brother ed to sing a few songs
[1:11:51] but i trust this would be your heart's
[1:11:53] desire during this lockdown yo draw near
[1:11:56] to god
[1:11:57] you know you know the rapture which is
[1:11:59] it means the catching away
[1:12:01] it's for those who are already caught
[1:12:03] away
[1:12:05] if you're excited about the word of god
[1:12:07] if there's something in you that just
[1:12:09] loves him loves his word
[1:12:11] you know what's happened you're actually
[1:12:13] caught up in him
[1:12:14] you're in a love affair
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:19] right because why because you're
[1:12:21] enjoying you're feasting on the goodness
[1:12:22] of god
[1:12:23] and if you've grown a bit cold in your
[1:12:26] walk spend some time with them say lord
[1:12:29] you said yo you know in order to resist
[1:12:32] the devil who wants to resist the devil
[1:12:35] we know the devil's on our case
[1:12:37] everyone says resist the devil and he
[1:12:39] will flee from you but the first part of
[1:12:40] that scripture is draw night to god and
[1:12:42] he'll draw night to you
[1:12:45] and this says resist the devil and he'll
[1:12:46] flee
[1:12:47] so if the devil's on our case is in our
[1:12:49] mind he's troubling our family draw nigh
[1:12:51] to god he'll draw nights to you and then
[1:12:54] resist the devil how do you resist the
[1:12:56] devil turn down what he's trying to sell
[1:12:58] you
[1:13:00] just say i'm not buying
[1:13:02] you can knock on someone else's door
[1:13:04] you're not welcome here
[1:13:06] amen but let's use this time
[1:13:10] let's use this time to draw an eye to
[1:13:11] god like never before
[1:13:13] as individuals as families
[1:13:16] and let's believe that the lord is gonna
[1:13:19] he's gonna visit every house
[1:13:21] hallelujah
[1:13:23] who want you know in order for naturally
[1:13:26] for people to come visit us we naturally
[1:13:27] prepare but we want to prepare our
[1:13:29] hearts we're gonna sweep out all the
[1:13:31] malice and all the strife and all the
