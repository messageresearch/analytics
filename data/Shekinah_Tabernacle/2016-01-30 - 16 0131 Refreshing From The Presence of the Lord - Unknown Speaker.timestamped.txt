[0:01] welcome to the house of god
[0:04] amen who's feeling good
[0:07] amen that's the way it's always good
[0:09] being a christian
[0:11] amen it's not always easy but it's
[0:13] always good
[0:14] amen he said i'll never leave you nor
[0:15] forsake you
[0:17] and when you go through life's journey
[0:19] you realize that's the truth
[0:21] and
[0:22] i think the whole walk is just to
[0:26] help us to have faith in god and trust
[0:28] him if you look at all your trials at
[0:30] the end of it we had more trust and more
[0:32] faith in god
[0:33] and
[0:35] he's a very big god and he knows all
[0:37] things and he's got all things under
[0:39] control
[0:40] and
[0:42] we just need to rest and trust him
[0:45] you know when we start off in our walk
[0:46] we get worked up over a lot of things
[0:47] and we think we need to sort a lot of
[0:49] things out but as we go on and on and on
[0:51] we realize the more that we just cast
[0:53] our cares and our burns upon him
[0:55] the more that he can
[0:56] undertake and it just gets easier
[0:59] because we don't have to carry so much
[1:01] or deal with so much because we can just
[1:02] lay cast our burdens upon him
[1:05] and he never fails he never fails and he
[1:08] just wants us to trust him so let's um
[1:10] let's just thank the lord this morning
[1:12] that we can be here and
[1:13] have the opportunity to walk in the
[1:15] light because it's a grand opportunity
[1:17] that we have to walk in the light
[1:20] amen
[1:21] heavenly father we're so grateful that
[1:23] we can be gathered here this morning
[1:26] and to know that you've called us

[1:31] that call and we we're
[1:33] lord we're eternally grateful for that

[1:38] feel welcome in our midst this morning
[1:40] maybe last side the the
[1:42] things of the week and the cares of this
[1:43] life
[1:44] for a moment lord of the times they
[1:46] might seem like they're worthy of
[1:47] thinking about and dwelling on lord but
[1:51] one thing is need for lord and that's
[1:52] just to fix their eyes upon you lord and
[1:55] be filled with your spirit
[1:58] and to fellowship with you that's that's
[1:59] ultimately what is needful in our life

[19:12] items
[19:15] but i'm not sure
[19:16] if your item is fast or slow our one's a
[19:18] bit fast so i'm going to do one first
[19:20] and then is your one slow okay cool that
[19:22] will be a good lead into the worship so
[19:24] we'll do we'll do the music team have
[19:27] kind of been working on a song
[19:31] kind of but um
[19:33] this is our first time doing it but we
[19:34] just want to
[19:35] uh
[19:36] it's a new song and we just i just want
[19:38] to play it in a church atmosphere just
[19:39] to see how
[19:40] what what what the
[19:42] just what it's like
[19:43] um
[19:44] so this is when we we're a new one we're
[19:46] working on
[19:48] and we'll play it through once maybe and
[19:50] then the second time just join in and
[19:51] sing it the second time through
[19:53] and can you bring that up um
[19:55] brother
[19:57] ben has put it on on the
[19:59] projector i just want to read out some
[20:01] of the words
[20:02] and we'll just see how this one goes
[20:06] we've kind of been enjoying writing
[20:07] songs lately and we all sort of work
[20:09] together on it and um
[20:12] all the songs that we sing here someone
[20:14] else has written so we figure hey we'll
[20:15] just write our own you know well not
[20:17] like we don't like the other ones but
[20:19] if someone else writes them so can we
[20:20] that's kind of how i've always looked at
[20:22] it so the words are this um
[20:24] and it's called jubilee it's about it's
[20:26] typing the
[20:28] um
[20:29] you know in the old testament jubilee
[20:31] when someone had debts and they were
[20:32] sold then they had the jubilee year and
[20:34] typing that to our jubilee that when we
[20:36] heard the jubilee call we went free so
[20:38] the the verse the verses years and years
[20:40] i labored toil and tears were my meat
[20:43] since my debtors took me prisoner sold
[20:48] sold me to slavery
[20:50] but every day that i toiled the jubilee
[20:51] was drawn closer the 49th year was the
[20:53] longest year that i heard the trumpet
[20:55] sound and in the choruses
[20:57] and when i heard the jubilee i'll walk
[20:59] free
[21:00] and then the last one ain't going back
[21:01] to slavery because jesus has set me free
[21:03] the second verse
[21:04] because um years i spent in confusion i
[21:06] had ice but couldn't see
[21:08] the enemy had me stumbling in darkness
[21:10] spiritual slavery and i heard the
[21:11] prophet speaking i heard the voice
[21:13] behind the voice he opened up the word
[21:15] and let the light shine and said you can
[21:16] all go free
[21:17] and then this is the last piece just to
[21:19] get you to know what the song is like
[21:20] okay
[21:24] i'll probably be doing this on my own
[21:25] for most of the first time through
[21:32] sorry i need sorry about that i just
[21:34] need the words
[21:39] if you start to catch it just start
[21:41] singing along it'll be good good
[21:46] let's do
[21:57] years that years i labored
[22:01] toiling tears with my me
[22:05] since my deadest took me prisoner
[22:10] sold me to slavery
[22:15] but every day that i toiled
[22:19] that you believe was drawing closer
[22:23] the 49th year was the longest year
[22:29] then i heard the trumpet sound
[22:32] and when i heard the jubilee i walk free
[22:37] i walk free i woke free when i heard the
[22:43] jubilee
[22:44] i woke free and i ain't going back to
[22:48] slavery
[22:51] because jesus has set me free
[22:58] years i spent in confusion
[23:03] i had eyes but couldn't see
[23:08] enemy had me stumbling in darkness
[23:12] spiritual slavery
[23:17] but then i heard the prophet speaking
[23:22] i heard the voice behind the voice
[23:26] he opened up the word and let the light
[23:29] shining
[23:31] said you can all go free
[23:49] and i'm
[23:50] going back to slavery
[23:54] because jesus has set me free
[24:00] and when i heard the

[51:00] just gonna read a couple of scriptures
[51:01] from acts chapter three
[51:05] and then uh
[51:07] then from matthew chapter four and then
[51:08] i want to read one scripture from micah
[51:10] chapter seven
[51:12] so acts chapter three we'll just start
[51:13] from verse 13.
[51:19] i'm going to read down to verse 21.
[51:24] and so he says here now
[51:27] this is after the man at the gate
[51:29] beautiful was healed
[51:31] and so now peter begins to speak to the
[51:33] people he says the god of abraham and of
[51:35] isaac and of jacob the god of our
[51:37] fathers has glorified his son jesus whom
[51:40] he delivered up and denied him in the
[51:41] presence of pilate
[51:43] when he were when he was determined to
[51:45] let him go but he denied the holy one
[51:47] and the just and desired a murderer to
[51:49] be granted unto you and kill the prince
[51:52] of life whom god has raised up from the
[51:54] dead whereof we are witnesses and his
[51:56] name
[51:58] and his name through faith in his name
[52:00] hath made this man strong
[52:03] whom ye see and know yea the faith which
[52:05] is by him has given him this perfect
[52:08] soundness in the presence of you all and
[52:10] now brethren i what
[52:12] that
[52:13] through ignorance ye did it as did also
[52:16] your rulers
[52:17] but those things which god before had
[52:20] showed by the mouth of all his prophets
[52:22] that christ should suffer he has so
[52:25] fulfilled repent you therefore and be
[52:27] converted that your sins may be blotted
[52:30] out when when the times of refreshing
[52:33] shall come
[52:34] from the presence of the lord and he
[52:37] shall send
[52:38] jesus christ which before was preached
[52:41] unto you whom the heaven must receive
[52:43] until the restitution i mean until the
[52:45] times of restitution of all things which
[52:47] god has spoken by the mouth of all his
[52:50] holy prophets since the word began
[52:53] i mean sorry since the will began then
[52:54] we'll go to uh matthew chapter four so
[52:57] notice he says that there have come at
[52:58] times of refreshing from the presence of
[53:00] god and i want to go into that a little
[53:03] bit today
[53:05] so matthew chapter 4 and read verses 12
[53:07] down to verse 16.
[53:10] just for a bit of a
[53:12] context and we've got it then we'll go
[53:13] to micah chapter seven now when jesus
[53:15] had heard that john was cast into prison
[53:17] he departed into galilee and leaving
[53:19] nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum
[53:22] which is upon the seacoast and the
[53:23] borders of zebulun and nephilim that it
[53:26] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[53:28] isis the prophet saying the land of uh
[53:31] zebulun in the land of nephilim by the
[53:33] way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of
[53:35] the gentiles the people which sat in
[53:38] darkness saw great light and to them
[53:40] which sat in the regions and shadow of
[53:42] death light is sprung up from that time
[53:45] jesus began to preach and to say repent
[53:48] for the kingdom of heave the kingdom of
[53:50] heaven is at hand
[53:52] amen and we'll just go to
[53:54] micah chapter seven
[54:06] and we're read verses seven and eight
[54:17] it's uh micah is
[54:19] after obadiah amos obadiah them are the
[54:22] minor prophets
[54:25] amen but just listen to listen to this
[54:28] he says therefore i will look unto the
[54:30] lord i will wait for the god of my
[54:32] salvation my god will hear me rejoice
[54:36] not against me oh my enemy when i fall i
[54:38] shall arise when i sit in darkness the
[54:41] lord shall be a light unto me
[54:43] amen you may be seated may the lord
[54:45] bless his word
[54:47] now i want to
[54:48] i want to talk about the times of
[54:51] uh so so the refreshing sent from the
[54:53] presence of the lord today
[54:55] and hopefully i just want to um maybe
[54:57] just
[54:58] yeah i really pray by the end of the
[55:00] service you'll appreciate a little bit
[55:01] more the time that we're alive in
[55:03] now we understand that that that god and
[55:06] his in his great plan as certain things
[55:08] happen at a certain time you know the
[55:10] law came at a certain time the prophets
[55:12] came at a certain time jesus was born
[55:15] died rose again at a certain time you
[55:16] know there was always season for certain
[55:18] things to happen
[55:20] and
[55:21] it says in ecclesiastes 3 it says to
[55:23] everything there is a season and a time
[55:25] to every purpose under heaven
[55:27] and so god god has a season that that
[55:30] certain things are going to happen
[55:32] and this time of refreshing
[55:34] that peter was speaking about here was
[55:36] was actually he was speaking of
[55:38] something that would come
[55:40] and i can say by what god is doing among
[55:43] us i mean worldwide we are living in
[55:45] that time of refreshing
[55:46] so
[55:48] you know it says in isaiah 55 and i'm
[55:50] just going to read some scriptures here
[55:52] um so in isaiah 55 10 and and we know
[55:54] this quite well it says for as the rain
[55:56] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[55:59] returneth not hither but watereth the
[56:01] earth and maketh it bring forth and bud
[56:03] that it may give sea to the sower and
[56:05] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[56:08] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[56:10] shall not return unto me void but it
[56:12] shall accomplish that which i please it
[56:14] shall prosper in the thing we're into
[56:16] ascended so when god sends his word
[56:19] there's a specific purpose it is from
[56:21] sending his word and it always comes in
[56:23] a certain season and so
[56:26] there is a reason why
[56:28] why
[56:29] god would send a message in this end
[56:30] time
[56:31] and that and he has a particular intent
[56:34] why he would send it and we understand
[56:36] it's not just that we would understand
[56:38] the bible but it would actually liberate
[56:39] a people i mean it would open a people's
[56:42] eyes that they would not walk in
[56:43] darkness anymore but they would be able
[56:44] to walk in liberty
[56:46] and
[56:47] so this time of refreshing because
[56:50] you know we understand how peter said
[56:52] here that your sins may be blotted out
[56:55] when the time of refreshing shall come
[56:57] from the presence of the lord so there's
[56:59] a time where the people's sins would be
[57:02] fully blotted out and that was in the
[57:04] times of the refreshing
[57:06] now
[57:06] that this if i just want to i'm just
[57:09] going to try and tie this all together
[57:10] but i just hope you bear with me now
[57:12] this word times in the greek it means a
[57:16] set or proper time
[57:18] it means also means an opportunity or a
[57:20] or a season so it's talking about a
[57:22] certain season where a refreshing is
[57:24] going to come from the presence of the
[57:26] lord and this refreshing in the greek
[57:29] it means it means a it means a recovery
[57:32] of breath
[57:33] and figuratively it means a revival
[57:36] and a revival is an awakening
[57:39] so when it says when this refreshing
[57:40] comes it will it is actually a revival
[57:43] comes from the presence of the lord amen
[57:45] an awakening comes upon the people
[57:48] and we understand that there has been
[57:50] sure there's been revivals down through
[57:52] the ages but there has to come a time
[57:54] where a revival doesn't just break forth
[57:57] and then die down and then break forth
[57:58] and die down but there comes a time
[58:00] where the people actually stay in
[58:02] revival
[58:03] amen and brother braham says he yo he
[58:05] says about the church world you know
[58:07] early i think it's early 60s or maybe
[58:09] late 50s he says the revival fires are
[58:12] going down
[58:13] but then he says later on keep that
[58:15] spirit of revival around you
[58:17] amen so for the church world the revival
[58:20] fires were going down and you can see
[58:22] that in church history where great
[58:24] healing revivals came upon the scene but
[58:26] then they all began to go down and they
[58:28] went towards either intellectual ideas
[58:30] or went off into fanaticism whatever
[58:32] they did and but then he said he says at
[58:35] the end of his ministry he says now the
[58:37] bride he says he says there's an
[58:38] awakening of the bride happening a
[58:41] revival of the bride
[58:43] he says he says you know he says uh you
[58:46] know you know the great paper the herald
[58:48] of is coming and it's still published
[58:49] today he says all they say is right yo
[58:52] all they print us fast and pray fast and
[58:54] pray sound and trumpet pray pray pray
[58:56] there's gonna be a new breaking of the
[58:58] day and he says why do they do that he
[59:00] says they're good people and being
[59:02] christians they feel the pull of the
[59:04] hour
[59:05] but he says they've missed the awakening
[59:07] of the bride
[59:08] amen they've missed the refreshing
[59:10] that's being poured out from the
[59:11] presence of god i mean to awaken the
[59:14] people
[59:16] so
[59:18] the the refreshing that he sends i say
[59:22] is linked to his word
[59:24] his word being sent is linked to the
[59:25] refreshing
[59:27] amen god always sends his word and then
[59:29] that accomplishes a certain thing
[59:33] and then he also says in joel
[59:36] he says it's in joel chapter 2
[59:39] he says be glad then you children of
[59:41] zion and rejoice in your god and in the
[59:44] lord your god for he has given you the
[59:46] former rain moderately and he will cause
[59:49] to come down for you the rain the former
[59:52] rain and the latter rain in the first
[59:54] month and the floor shall be full of
[59:56] wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[59:58] wine and oil and i'll restore to you the
[1:00:01] years that the locust has eaten the
[1:00:03] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:00:04] palm worm my great army which i sent
[1:00:07] among you and you shall eat in plenty
[1:00:09] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[1:00:12] the lord your god that hath dwelt
[1:00:15] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:00:17] never be ashamed
[1:00:19] so he's speaking prophetically of a time
[1:00:21] of restoration that would happen
[1:00:24] and this this restoration
[1:00:26] ties into these two rains a former and
[1:00:28] ladder rain
[1:00:29] and in the hebrew a former rain it means
[1:00:32] a teaching rain that's what the word
[1:00:34] former actually is is a teaching rain
[1:00:36] and then the latter rain is actually a
[1:00:38] harvest rain or a gathering rain
[1:00:40] so these two rains will actually merge
[1:00:43] together to to cause the crop to grow
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] so in times past and that's why you can
[1:00:50] see you know you go back people have
[1:00:52] been in the meshes 40 years
[1:00:54] and then now you come in and you see
[1:00:56] people have been in the message maybe
[1:00:57] two years
[1:00:58] and they've actually grown to the same
[1:01:00] level
[1:01:01] amen where it took people 40 years to
[1:01:04] grow to a certain level of maturity
[1:01:06] people just two years have come in and
[1:01:07] they've come to that same maturity now
[1:01:09] why is that because there was a there
[1:01:12] was a former a teaching reign that fell
[1:01:14] but then there has to come a season
[1:01:15] whether whether whether teaching rain
[1:01:18] falls and then there's another reign of
[1:01:20] the spirit because we understand what
[1:01:21] he's talking about rainier he's talking
[1:01:22] about the spirit coming down and there
[1:01:24] comes a season where where that ladder
[1:01:26] rain or that harvesting rain they both
[1:01:29] run together so one time it was planted
[1:01:31] then then years later it's actually come
[1:01:33] to be grown i mean by ladder rain but
[1:01:36] now it's actually running together that
[1:01:38] those both rains are running together so
[1:01:40] so the word goes forth the teaching goes
[1:01:42] forth and then there's also a reign
[1:01:44] there that quickens that that word in
[1:01:46] the people it begins to grow
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] and so this this is the season that
[1:01:51] we're alive and that's why people who
[1:01:52] come in
[1:01:53] nowadays they're just catching so
[1:01:55] quickly they just grow
[1:01:56] because those anointings those reigns
[1:01:58] are running together thank you
[1:02:00] hallelujah
[1:02:02] see to me it's so tremendous because we
[1:02:04] didn't have to you know god allowed us
[1:02:06] to be born in this hour and i'm talking
[1:02:08] about spiritually born
[1:02:11] i mean that we didn't have to maybe
[1:02:13] fight those battles that that people
[1:02:15] have been years have fought
[1:02:18] amen but we just came into this time
[1:02:19] where god says i'm going to pour out the
[1:02:21] latter and the former rain together and
[1:02:23] you know there's a time of refreshing
[1:02:28] amen and the floor shall be full of
[1:02:30] wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:02:32] oil and wine your wheat is bread
[1:02:35] give us us to our daily bread
[1:02:37] and the fat shall overflow with wine we
[1:02:39] know wine is a stimulation caused by the
[1:02:41] revelation of the word
[1:02:43] amen and then oil is the anointing
[1:02:46] we understand that and he says i will
[1:02:48] restore so he says when these when these
[1:02:50] two reigns come together he says i will
[1:02:52] restore to you the years that the locust
[1:02:54] has eaten the cankworm the caterpillar
[1:02:56] and the palmer worm and we understand
[1:02:58] that that was the actually the
[1:03:00] antichrist coming in and chewing down
[1:03:02] the true
[1:03:03] true church into nothing and then it was
[1:03:05] grown again
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:08] so he's saying when these two reigns
[1:03:09] come together this is all going to
[1:03:11] happen
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:14] we are living in this time amen
[1:03:18] we are living in this time
[1:03:20] because even the prophet he says he says
[1:03:22] in 53
[1:03:24] he says he said in the last days i'll
[1:03:26] send down the reign in abundance like
[1:03:28] that both former and later reign will
[1:03:30] fall on this date and what they had back
[1:03:33] there
[1:03:35] plus what god's going to give us is
[1:03:37] right now at hand
[1:03:39] amen i believe with all my heart and i
[1:03:42] believe we're at the age of the battle
[1:03:44] don't you think so let's not push back
[1:03:46] but
[1:03:47] they want to push back let them push
[1:03:49] back but we're going forward amen it's
[1:03:51] ours god says it's yours now go on there
[1:03:54] and take it so he's saying that he's
[1:03:56] saying
[1:03:58] that
[1:04:01] he says
[1:04:03] he says amen he says now
[1:04:06] and what they had back there plus what
[1:04:08] god is going to give us right now at
[1:04:09] hand amen so he's saying it's going to
[1:04:11] happen
[1:04:12] this isn't 53 and then in 65
[1:04:16] he says if they so this isn't things
[1:04:18] that aren't the beast is the is at the
[1:04:19] end of his ministry if they look back in
[1:04:22] the scripture and see what the messiah
[1:04:24] was supposed to do
[1:04:25] then they would have known him by the
[1:04:27] vindication that god through christ
[1:04:29] would reconcile the world to himself and
[1:04:32] to bring to pass all the promises that
[1:04:34] was of the messiah that he was to do
[1:04:37] jesus bore the record of that word
[1:04:39] making that word live for that day
[1:04:41] and i believe it's the same thing
[1:04:44] we live in today god bring record of his
[1:04:46] word by vindicating what he said he
[1:04:48] would do
[1:04:49] now we know that this is the day of
[1:04:51] salvation where god is calling man from
[1:04:54] the world from a life of sin unto a life
[1:04:57] of service and in the day that god has
[1:05:00] poured out his spirit from on high great
[1:05:02] signs and wonders are to
[1:05:04] to accompany the ministry of this day
[1:05:06] this is when the former and latter rain
[1:05:08] are falling together
[1:05:11] amen so he's saying this is the season
[1:05:13] now where this is taking place
[1:05:15] and we know
[1:05:16] that they're supposed to be great
[1:05:18] signers and wonders which in many great
[1:05:20] denominations this is turned down but
[1:05:22] i'm thankful for these open doors that i
[1:05:25] have had to come into an inspiration
[1:05:28] amen of he says
[1:05:29] to give a young man like your pastor
[1:05:31] here that's causing him so he's saying
[1:05:32] that so he was looking for it in 53 but
[1:05:34] says now it's falling together
[1:05:36] it means there comes a change in the
[1:05:38] season
[1:05:41] so refreshing
[1:05:43] as i said a refreshing is a revival
[1:05:47] amen so so that word refreshing as i
[1:05:50] said
[1:05:50] is as a recovery of breath or
[1:05:52] figuratively a revival
[1:05:54] to be and and to be
[1:05:56] a revival as an awakening
[1:05:58] now this may be a bit
[1:06:01] dreary but just just just just just hold
[1:06:03] on
[1:06:04] now
[1:06:05] in the presence of god unrecognized and
[1:06:08] he says this many times in his in his in
[1:06:10] his ministry where where he went and he
[1:06:12] stood by lake michigan
[1:06:14] and he saw that you know as a great
[1:06:15] storm had whipped up on the lake
[1:06:17] and then he says
[1:06:19] you know he says now
[1:06:20] what is happening to the lake and he
[1:06:22] realized the lake is having a revival
[1:06:25] amen so so it's the wind that comes down
[1:06:28] upon the lake
[1:06:29] caused the waves to whip up and so and
[1:06:32] he said he said there's no more water in
[1:06:34] the lake than
[1:06:36] before the wind begin to blow so there's
[1:06:38] not a it's not a adding to the lake but
[1:06:40] it's an awakening and stirring up of the
[1:06:42] lake and then when the wind comes down
[1:06:44] over the lake then all the
[1:06:46] all the trash and all the you know
[1:06:48] uh driftwood and whatever more that gets
[1:06:50] blown up on the bank
[1:06:52] amen so so so he says that this is what
[1:06:55] a revival does now
[1:06:57] he says that's what we need now he's
[1:06:59] speaking now he says a washing of
[1:07:01] unbelief onto the bank
[1:07:04] let the word of god have preeminences
[1:07:06] that's what we need a revival to wash
[1:07:08] all the unbelief out and all the bugs
[1:07:10] and superstitions and things come out
[1:07:13] and see that god's still god
[1:07:15] so he's saying no and a revival is to
[1:07:17] awaken a people and it actually pushes
[1:07:19] the unbelief
[1:07:20] oh so so when people when people become
[1:07:23] awakened
[1:07:24] i mean it pushes the unbelief off of
[1:07:26] them
[1:07:27] i mean that they're not carrying the
[1:07:28] unbelief anymore but the unbelief has
[1:07:30] turned to faith amen amen that they
[1:07:33] really believe and then it says let the
[1:07:35] word of god have preeminences so there
[1:07:37] are people when they turn from unbelief
[1:07:39] to faith what happens is this has
[1:07:42] becomes number one
[1:07:44] i mean this has this has pre-eminence
[1:07:46] you understand so that now
[1:07:49] when we when the word has preeminence
[1:07:51] that means when it becomes number one
[1:07:53] then people can stand upon the word
[1:07:55] alone and when a believer stands upon
[1:07:57] the word alone in faith then nothing
[1:07:59] will shake them
[1:08:01] i mean if you can stand upon not your
[1:08:03] feelings or not or not what you see with
[1:08:05] your eyes but if you can stand upon the
[1:08:07] word
[1:08:08] amen nothing can shake you nothing can
[1:08:11] shake a believer that's standing upon
[1:08:13] the word of god it doesn't matter how
[1:08:14] they feel they may feel upside down
[1:08:17] turned around about whatever more but if
[1:08:19] they can say this is what the word says
[1:08:21] and they stand there in faith amen
[1:08:23] nothing can shake them
[1:08:25] hallelujah so so a revival causes the
[1:08:28] people amen for all their superstitions
[1:08:31] because if someone has some superstition
[1:08:34] a superstition is having faith in the
[1:08:37] wrong thing amen and unbelief you can
[1:08:40] have faith in something that's wrong
[1:08:42] and if you actually do that's actually
[1:08:43] an unbelief
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:46] because you're believing in the wrong
[1:08:48] thing
[1:08:49] amen but if you have faith in the pure
[1:08:51] word of god
[1:08:52] that's a very different thing it's like
[1:08:54] someone you know you know
[1:08:56] brother isaac wrote the song
[1:08:58] and if people actually say you're free
[1:09:01] i mean the gospel trumpet blows you're
[1:09:03] free
[1:09:04] but then someone actually has a
[1:09:06] superstition
[1:09:07] well i'm not good enough
[1:09:09] how can i be free
[1:09:10] and they wrestle with their humanity
[1:09:13] amen they're actually putting faith in
[1:09:15] the fact that they can't do it
[1:09:17] i mean they're believing the wrong thing
[1:09:20] amen but it's not the condition you know
[1:09:23] you know you go back in the old
[1:09:24] testament times when when someone was a
[1:09:27] slave they had to sell themselves into
[1:09:28] slavery or whatever happened
[1:09:31] the condition they are in
[1:09:33] when the when the trumpet blew
[1:09:35] had had no bearing on them going free
[1:09:38] it had absolutely no it there was no you
[1:09:41] know you know it didn't even come up
[1:09:43] into the equation in god's mind he said
[1:09:45] all you have to do is hear the trumpet i
[1:09:48] mean drop what you're doing and go back
[1:09:49] to what belongs to you that's all you
[1:09:51] have to do you don't have to weigh up
[1:09:53] you know well i've been this kind of
[1:09:54] slave and my inheritance is all the way
[1:09:56] over there and you know well i yeah i've
[1:09:58] been this kind of person and you know
[1:10:00] going into your backstory and this is
[1:10:02] what caused me to come into slavery
[1:10:04] we're all born slaves that's right amen
[1:10:07] it doesn't matter how that manifested
[1:10:09] upon the earth that's irrelevant i mean
[1:10:11] when you hear the trumpet just drop what
[1:10:12] you're doing
[1:10:14] amen and walk back to what belongs to
[1:10:16] you
[1:10:16] that's all you have to do because this
[1:10:18] member it's not the person in slavery
[1:10:20] that actually cause themselves to become
[1:10:22] free it's god's trumpet that is blown
[1:10:25] his word that's proclaimed i mean that
[1:10:27] is what causes the freedom hallelujah
[1:10:30] not the not the people
[1:10:33] amen it's our condition whatever we
[1:10:36] wrestle with
[1:10:38] don't don't bring that to the forefront
[1:10:41] amen just let the spirit of god brush
[1:10:43] that aside amen amen because the very
[1:10:45] reason if you've got something in your
[1:10:47] heart that you want to be free that you
[1:10:49] want more of god that means you have
[1:10:51] more of god to have
[1:10:52] amen because there can only be a deep in
[1:10:54] here longing in here if there's
[1:10:56] something out there to meet that longing
[1:10:58] that was there before it was in here
[1:11:01] hallelujah
[1:11:02] amen we always got to remember that
[1:11:05] now
[1:11:06] we read there in matthew chapter 4 about
[1:11:08] the verses of the people and they and
[1:11:10] they said and you know you're that sat
[1:11:12] in darkness
[1:11:14] now let's just go let's just go to
[1:11:15] isaiah chapter nine from where matthew
[1:11:18] was uh quoting from
[1:11:21] because
[1:11:22] the people the light the light that
[1:11:24] people see amen is tired that is the
[1:11:28] refreshing coming
[1:11:30] i mean because you could i'm sure you
[1:11:31] could agree when jesus became when god
[1:11:33] became flesh then god was about to open
[1:11:36] a great big gusher of eternal life a
[1:11:38] refreshing a revival was going to come i
[1:11:40] mean to awaken a people
[1:11:42] that that they were not meant to be
[1:11:44] whatever state they found themselves in
[1:11:46] before jesus came
[1:11:48] hallelujah the woman at the well she
[1:11:50] wasn't meant to be like that
[1:11:52] just life had caused her to go in that
[1:11:54] direction but that wasn't who she really
[1:11:56] was
[1:11:57] hallelujah
[1:11:59] amen that's not who we really are meant
[1:12:01] to be
[1:12:02] isaiah chapter nine
[1:12:07] now let's read this isaiah 9 and we'll
[1:12:09] read one to four
[1:12:14] he says
[1:12:16] nevertheless the dimness
[1:12:18] shall not be as
[1:12:19] shall
[1:12:20] not be as such as was in her vexation
[1:12:24] when at the first she lightly afflicted
[1:12:27] the land of zebulun in there in the land
[1:12:29] of
[1:12:31] naphtali
[1:12:32] and afterwards did more grievously
[1:12:34] afflict her by the way of the sea beyond
[1:12:36] jordan
[1:12:37] in the galilee of the nations
[1:12:39] the people that walked in darkness have
[1:12:41] seen a great light
[1:12:43] they that dwell in the land of the
[1:12:45] shadow of death upon them hath the light
[1:12:48] shine
[1:12:49] he has multiplied the nation and not
[1:12:52] increased the joy they joy before thee
[1:12:55] according to the joy and harvest and as
[1:12:58] men rejoice when they divide the spoil
[1:13:01] for thou has broken the yoke of his
[1:13:04] burden and the staff of his shoulder and
[1:13:07] the rod of his oppressor as in the days
[1:13:10] of midian so he's saying so so isaiah
[1:13:14] prophesying here saying that when when
[1:13:16] these people that walked in darkness had
[1:13:18] seen great light
[1:13:20] and they that dwell in the land of the
[1:13:22] shadow of death upon them has the light
[1:13:24] shine this is what's going to happen to
[1:13:26] these people
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:28] that that the bird so so he is going to
[1:13:32] break the yoke of his burden
[1:13:34] and the staff of his shoulder and the
[1:13:37] rod of his oppressor as in the days of
[1:13:40] midian now in the days of midian speaks
[1:13:42] of when gideon and his 300 defeated the
[1:13:45] people of midian and the people of the
[1:13:47] east
[1:13:48] amen so there comes it so so that was a
[1:13:50] liberation of the land
[1:13:53] you're with me
[1:13:54] amen there was a liberation of the land
[1:13:56] and so so there was a remember gideon he
[1:13:59] was hiding away in a cave wherever he
[1:14:01] was trying to thresh some wheat because
[1:14:03] the midianites came in the people of the
[1:14:05] east they just ate up the whole country
[1:14:07] so
[1:14:08] the israelites they were living in
[1:14:10] israel but they sure weren't in control
[1:14:12] of the land
[1:14:13] amen so they were believers they were
[1:14:15] believers in their inheritance
[1:14:17] but they were on the run from these
[1:14:19] other forces that came in
[1:14:21] amen so so it's possible to actually be
[1:14:24] birthed into the kingdom
[1:14:26] i mean to actually be standing in your
[1:14:27] inheritance but then you're on the run
[1:14:30] amen there's actually a a rod of the
[1:14:33] oppressor is on you i mean there's a
[1:14:35] burden upon you it is possible
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:39] but then he says now when these people
[1:14:41] saw great light so there came a system
[1:14:43] where light came
[1:14:45] i mean in the times of the refreshing
[1:14:47] and so a light came
[1:14:49] and it broke it broke his burden and the
[1:14:52] staff of his shoulder and the rod of his
[1:14:54] oppressor
[1:14:55] now
[1:14:56] the days of midian as i said it was
[1:14:58] getting his 300 men
[1:15:00] they they they came to the camp of the
[1:15:03] of the midianites and the people of the
[1:15:04] east and they separate themselves around
[1:15:06] the camp
[1:15:07] and you see how they how did they defeat
[1:15:10] that enemy
[1:15:11] amen he was instructed to to to
[1:15:16] uh shine the light and blow the trumpet
[1:15:19] amen that's how that's how they found me
[1:15:21] that's how they defeated the enemy in
[1:15:23] that day so they so they blew the
[1:15:25] trumpet and they shone the light
[1:15:28] i mean so they blew the gospel trumpet
[1:15:30] and shine the light amen amen how do you
[1:15:32] how do you see the enemy defeated blow
[1:15:34] the trumpet amen hallelujah and shine
[1:15:37] the light amen this little light of mine
[1:15:39] i'm going to let it shine this life
[1:15:41] that's in me i'm going to let it shine i
[1:15:43] won't say to it i'm not going to let
[1:15:44] satan blow it out
[1:15:46] amen you blow the trumpet amen share the
[1:15:48] word
[1:15:49] amen in wisdom share the word and that's
[1:15:52] what causes the yoke of the oppressor to
[1:15:54] be broken
[1:15:55] amen shine the light this is a day where
[1:15:58] the light needs to be shot
[1:16:00] hallelujah i'm not just talking about on
[1:16:02] the streets but but in our homes i mean
[1:16:04] among our friends i mean at work shine
[1:16:07] the light amen hallelujah sound the
[1:16:09] trumpet because it's the word that sets
[1:16:11] the people free
[1:16:13] amen that's how they did it and it was a
[1:16:15] jubilee
[1:16:17] for the land in that day in a way
[1:16:19] because the land
[1:16:20] was freed from the enemy and they went
[1:16:22] back into their possession
[1:16:24] i mean shine the light friends
[1:16:27] shine the light
[1:16:29] now this this refreshing scent from the
[1:16:32] prince of the lord sets the people free
[1:16:36] and brother abraham and christ is a
[1:16:38] mystery god revealed
[1:16:41] he says this
[1:16:45] he says
[1:16:46] he so he's just i'm just coming halfway
[1:16:48] through a thought but he says well they
[1:16:49] say now wait a minute brother brown
[1:16:50] you're talking about the old testament
[1:16:52] it says he's the same yesterday today
[1:16:54] and forever it's the full revelation of
[1:16:56] god if god ever says anything he can
[1:16:59] never change it he's the way he always
[1:17:01] magnifies it not change it the law was
[1:17:03] magnified not change magnified whosoever
[1:17:06] commits adultery shall be guilty of
[1:17:07] death but whosoever now magnified
[1:17:10] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[1:17:12] he never changed the commandment he
[1:17:14] magnified it remember the sabbath day
[1:17:16] keep it holy one day in a week now he
[1:17:18] magnified it the rest comes from keeping
[1:17:21] the spirit of god precept upon precept
[1:17:24] line upon line here a little there a
[1:17:26] little hold fast to that which is good
[1:17:28] for stammering lips and other tongues
[1:17:30] while i speak to this people and this is
[1:17:32] the rest that's the refreshing from the
[1:17:35] presence of god
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:40] and so
[1:17:43] and so
[1:17:44] he says now the coming of the holy ghost
[1:17:46] in the end time
[1:17:48] is the refreshing come from the presence
[1:17:50] of god amen amen so when so so the light
[1:17:54] shines the word shines
[1:17:56] amen and it causes the people
[1:17:59] to receive it in faith
[1:18:01] and they receive the holy ghost and they
[1:18:03] enter into rest it's a refreshing that's
[1:18:05] poured out
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:10] so
[1:18:11] it sets the people free and that's why
[1:18:14] this yoke you know you could say that
[1:18:16] the rod of our oppressor was was broken
[1:18:19] i mean you can take isaiah 9 because he
[1:18:21] says all right he says shalom
[1:18:23] he says good morning it's sunup
[1:18:26] i mean the light shining the wood has
[1:18:28] been made manifest
[1:18:29] so he's saying now here comes a season
[1:18:31] that's come you know we've had we've had
[1:18:33] seven church ages
[1:18:35] and remember there was there were seven
[1:18:37] years of sabbath for the year of jubilee
[1:18:39] that's 49 yeah i mean i mean yo yo yo
[1:18:42] every year i mean seven years was a
[1:18:43] sabbath to them you know in this and
[1:18:45] then after the 49th year was a year of
[1:18:48] jubilee
[1:18:49] and then now we've come down seven
[1:18:50] church ages that's right amen we've come
[1:18:53] down seven church ages and then what
[1:18:55] happens now is because you know when we
[1:18:57] read the seventh church age jesus says
[1:18:59] behold i stand the door and knock
[1:19:02] so he's kicked out of his own church
[1:19:04] so there comes a time of the ladies and
[1:19:06] church age where jesus is on the outside
[1:19:08] of that church age
[1:19:10] and that was
[1:19:11] you know yo that happened 50 odd years
[1:19:14] ago
[1:19:15] he was kicked out because instead of
[1:19:16] them accepting jesus the word who was
[1:19:19] declaring himself they took their creeds
[1:19:21] and dogmas and two can't be in control
[1:19:24] so jesus was kicked out because they
[1:19:26] took a lie and they're now worshiping a
[1:19:28] lie
[1:19:29] so what happens now is is if you
[1:19:32] you know if you study the message
[1:19:34] brother brown speaks about a bright age
[1:19:36] at the end of 1965
[1:19:38] and you say well how can there be a
[1:19:39] bright age because there's only seven
[1:19:41] ages well it's an age within an age
[1:19:44] and then you just take like the modern
[1:19:45] era there was the era of the motor car
[1:19:48] and then the airplane then the jet plane
[1:19:50] then then there was space flight in the
[1:19:53] atomic age you know now we're in the age
[1:19:55] of the inter you know you're entering
[1:19:57] all these different things it's all
[1:19:58] different eras both in the same span of
[1:20:01] time
[1:20:02] amen
[1:20:04] excuse me so he's saying now this bright
[1:20:06] age he says he says that now
[1:20:09] because
[1:20:10] an age where we're where god is
[1:20:13] you know you know where god is that's
[1:20:14] where god is dealing
[1:20:16] so if he's kicked out of the way you
[1:20:18] know kicked out of the lady you're
[1:20:19] seeing church age where he has to be
[1:20:21] dealing somewhere
[1:20:22] and that's why now that's why the
[1:20:24] prophecy is now now we're in a bright
[1:20:26] age because he's calling a bride out
[1:20:28] as many as open the door
[1:20:30] and then in hebrews chapter 12 i believe
[1:20:32] it is it says let us go beyond the camp
[1:20:35] amen and suffer his reproach so he's
[1:20:37] actually a calling come out from where
[1:20:39] you are go beyond the camp
[1:20:40] amen and then go because remember he he
[1:20:42] died without jerusalem he died without
[1:20:44] the camp amen so we have to go with from
[1:20:47] wherever we are we're to go out to where
[1:20:49] he is
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:52] so now he's so he's saying that now we
[1:20:54] are in a we are in a bright age
[1:20:56] so
[1:20:57] as i said there's been
[1:20:59] there were seven year cycles of sabbath
[1:21:01] every every seven years was a sabbath
[1:21:03] and then the fiftieth year so after
[1:21:05] seven seven times seven is forty nine in
[1:21:07] the fiftieth year is the jubilee
[1:21:10] i mean so so after seven church changes
[1:21:12] i put it that way now comes a time of
[1:21:14] jubilee
[1:21:16] amen now comes a true time of jubilee
[1:21:18] where the people do not go back into
[1:21:20] slavery i remember they keep walking in
[1:21:22] liberty
[1:21:24] amen and this is the time of the
[1:21:25] refreshing that's a saying if you can
[1:21:28] recognize a day and now and what god is
[1:21:30] doing for you i mean i think you'll
[1:21:32] appreciate this age a lot more
[1:21:34] because some people they say it's so
[1:21:36] dark it's so vile and why did i have to
[1:21:37] live in this age sure it's dark and vile
[1:21:40] but don't look at the darkness look at
[1:21:42] the light
[1:21:43] i mean look at the look at what the
[1:21:44] light has done for you
[1:21:46] hallelujah because it's sure it's dark
[1:21:48] sure it's terrible but a light shining a
[1:21:51] liberty is being sounded amen where
[1:21:53] people can walk in freedom hallelujah
[1:21:56] that we don't have to walk and be you
[1:21:58] know slave to sin nature or or something
[1:22:01] that tries to blind us down you know if
[1:22:03] the devil tries to keep you down by
[1:22:05] something just recognize his rod is
[1:22:07] broken
[1:22:08] amen the yoke of the oppressor's done
[1:22:10] away with
[1:22:11] whom the son is set free is
[1:22:14] free indeed
[1:22:15] amen not partially free
[1:22:18] not on a parole or or on um
[1:22:22] what is it uh bail
[1:22:26] none of those conditions we're free
[1:22:28] indeed
[1:22:29] and all you have to say is yes lord i
[1:22:31] come amen amen that's all you have to do
[1:22:36] he says this
[1:22:39] there's on the rising of the sun
[1:22:42] he says now who is the son of man i'm
[1:22:44] just taking one quote where he speaks
[1:22:46] about the bright age
[1:22:48] it is in the beginning was the word and
[1:22:50] the word was with god and the word was
[1:22:52] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:22:53] dwelt among us and of all the teaching
[1:22:56] that we have and the confirmation of the
[1:22:59] word of god by the word of god by
[1:23:01] science by wonders we see today
[1:23:03] it's in the book of luke here i've just
[1:23:05] quoted luke 17 30 and malachi 4 and the
[1:23:08] different scriptures that we're
[1:23:10] acquainted with
[1:23:11] that that word again is waved over the
[1:23:13] people that the dead traditions of man
[1:23:16] is dead and the son of god is alive
[1:23:18] again with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:20] right among us and giving us life
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:24] as christ was the first ones arise from
[1:23:27] all the prophets and so forth although
[1:23:29] typed in many places he was the first
[1:23:31] fruits of those that slept and the bride
[1:23:33] coming of christ coming out of the
[1:23:35] church
[1:23:36] there'll have to be a sheath waved again
[1:23:38] in the last days oh my waving of the
[1:23:40] sheath what was the sheath the first one
[1:23:42] to come to mature
[1:23:44] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:23:46] that proved it was a sheath hallelujah
[1:23:49] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[1:23:52] it was waved over the people and the
[1:23:54] first time they will come forth for the
[1:23:57] bright age
[1:23:58] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:24:00] denominationalism
[1:24:02] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:24:04] of the word has turned back again in its
[1:24:07] full power and being waved over the
[1:24:09] people by the same signs and wonders he
[1:24:12] did back there because i live ye love
[1:24:14] also speaking to his wife
[1:24:16] i mean that's you by the way because i
[1:24:18] live you live also what a resurrection
[1:24:21] that was and what a resurrection this is
[1:24:24] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:24:26] alive in christ jesus by god's
[1:24:28] quickening power he was waved to them
[1:24:31] the word which he was was waved back to
[1:24:33] them on the day of pentecost the word
[1:24:35] made manifest and as i say he's to be
[1:24:38] waved again in the last day
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:42] so he say and and he's actually saying
[1:24:44] he is being waived
[1:24:46] amen he is being demonstrated
[1:24:48] and it's not just remember that at the
[1:24:50] times of refreshing we're living in a
[1:24:52] times of refreshing and i'll say his
[1:24:54] word is still being waived i mean that
[1:24:56] same god that was there is here
[1:24:58] i mean the same god that called them
[1:25:00] back there is calling you
[1:25:02] hallelujah the same god that has
[1:25:03] actually caused them to walk in freedom
[1:25:05] has caused you to walk in freedom i mean
[1:25:07] the same god that caused them to grow up
[1:25:09] into maturity is is maturing you amen
[1:25:12] hallelujah
[1:25:14] amen we're living in a time of
[1:25:15] refreshing from the presence of god
[1:25:18] hallelujah we're not here just just just
[1:25:20] trudging along but god is doing things i
[1:25:24] mean god is molding and shaping us he's
[1:25:26] working on us
[1:25:28] hallelujah where are free people today
[1:25:31] amen at times of refreshing as i said
[1:25:33] that was a time when the jubilee was
[1:25:35] going to be
[1:25:36] amen hallelujah
[1:25:38] amen we're not bound
[1:25:41] amen we're not bound by unbelief
[1:25:43] hallelujah or some or or something in
[1:25:45] life
[1:25:47] amen you say well i'm carrying a few
[1:25:49] heavy bags just drop them
[1:25:51] i mean they don't belong to you they
[1:25:53] never belong to you
[1:25:55] just drop them
[1:25:57] hallelujah
[1:26:00] now
[1:26:01] we understand in the book of acts now
[1:26:04] that the people
[1:26:06] when when when they came out of the
[1:26:08] upper room
[1:26:10] that was a time of refreshing
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:14] those people
[1:26:15] became free before they went into the
[1:26:18] upper room they are still bound with sin
[1:26:20] nature
[1:26:21] i mean peter tried to believe
[1:26:23] and he had some revelation now the
[1:26:25] christ the son living god but then when
[1:26:27] the pressure came down he cursed and he
[1:26:29] denied the lord three times and and and
[1:26:31] when he took the sword in the garden he
[1:26:33] wasn't just trying to wound the guy he's
[1:26:34] trying to chop his head off
[1:26:37] amen and then he just gets discouraged
[1:26:39] saying i'm going to go fishing again
[1:26:41] amen and jesus after he rose here
[1:26:43] without converted strengthen the
[1:26:45] brethren
[1:26:46] amen so here was one a sincere who
[1:26:49] believed and he actually had had had
[1:26:51] some faith
[1:26:52] but there wasn't there was no power yet
[1:26:56] to defeat that sin nature that was in
[1:26:58] his life
[1:26:59] amen so he was still a slave
[1:27:02] amen he was still a slave to that sin
[1:27:04] nature he was born with
[1:27:06] but then on the but then
[1:27:09] in the upper room now another life came
[1:27:11] in
[1:27:11] amen hallelujah eternal life came in
[1:27:15] amen that same one that was jesus said
[1:27:16] i'm not gonna just be with you i'm gonna
[1:27:18] be in you
[1:27:19] hallelujah so now he says you know when
[1:27:22] the day of you know when the day of
[1:27:23] pentecost had fully come
[1:27:26] amen there came a sound from heaven like
[1:27:28] a russian mighty wind you know shook the
[1:27:30] place in the pillar of fire came down
[1:27:31] separated itself upon the believers and
[1:27:34] now that was a refreshing that had been
[1:27:35] sent from the presence of god
[1:27:38] hallelujah because it awakened them to
[1:27:40] what they were
[1:27:42] amen and they were set free that day
[1:27:45] and we must have the holy ghost
[1:27:46] otherwise we'll still be in bondage
[1:27:49] amen even at our good attentions it
[1:27:51] takes a full surrender to god
[1:27:53] amen amen for that rest because they had
[1:27:55] not yet entered into the refreshing or
[1:27:57] the rest yet i mean because i just i
[1:28:00] just tying those two things together but
[1:28:01] then on day of pentecost the refreshing
[1:28:03] came and they were free indeed
[1:28:08] and then when they came out
[1:28:10] because the question is now
[1:28:12] you know you know brother brown makes a
[1:28:14] statement
[1:28:15] this is an invisible union
[1:28:18] he says in another woman
[1:28:22] so he's speaking of the church but he's
[1:28:24] going natural to his spiritual all the
[1:28:25] time and if a woman won't have a baby
[1:28:27] for her husband she'll take a dog or a
[1:28:29] cat or something she's got the mother
[1:28:30] something it it's their nature but to
[1:28:33] bear a child for a husband and raise it
[1:28:35] to the service of god that's entirely
[1:28:37] out of her line
[1:28:39] she should be so disgraced if she did uh
[1:28:43] if she did by her sin loving society in
[1:28:45] 1965 type of woman a true picture of the
[1:28:48] modern church today neither does the
[1:28:50] modern church want any of these here
[1:28:52] screaming shouting tongue speaking acts
[1:28:55] 238 youngins around here no she don't
[1:28:58] want any of them whooping and crying and
[1:29:00] screaming amen hallelujah why such a
[1:29:02] child would immediately put her out of
[1:29:04] her denomination
[1:29:06] they had one like that and one of the
[1:29:08] churches why they throw her out right
[1:29:10] quick
[1:29:11] why do you let such stuff go on
[1:29:14] so you see she's pregnant with something
[1:29:17] because she's bringing forth members all
[1:29:19] the time but you don't want none of them
[1:29:21] screaming hollering blabbering acts 238
[1:29:24] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:29:26] are it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:29:29] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:29:31] scientific society church that she
[1:29:34] belongs to that throw her out at the
[1:29:37] next council
[1:29:38] she can't have it so you don't so she
[1:29:41] don't want to be pregnant with the word
[1:29:43] because that's the only kind the word
[1:29:45] can bring forth born of the spirit of
[1:29:48] god it has the spirit of god in it no
[1:29:51] intellectual church joining creed going
[1:29:54] bob here painted face is not such a
[1:29:56] thing as that you don't find it in the
[1:29:58] word of god
[1:29:59] you find an old-fashioned sanctified
[1:30:01] holy ghost-filled child born of the
[1:30:04] spirit of god screaming hollering
[1:30:06] shouting praising god
[1:30:08] hallelujah so he says now he says they
[1:30:10] don't want an old-fashioned where where
[1:30:12] god comes in i mean then a life is lived
[1:30:15] out
[1:30:16] that's what they're saying it says they
[1:30:18] don't want it see miserable creatures
[1:30:20] they think that she is
[1:30:23] hallelujah
[1:30:24] but that is the only he says that's the
[1:30:26] only kind the word can bring forth i
[1:30:28] mean where life comes in you know
[1:30:30] something happens
[1:30:32] and now but we understand some people
[1:30:35] say well brother braham said this
[1:30:37] he says he says and is this a sign of
[1:30:40] the answer
[1:30:41] he says
[1:30:42] the mystery of the baptism of the holy
[1:30:45] ghost without sensation
[1:30:47] amen so some people just take that and
[1:30:49] they say you never feel nothing and you
[1:30:51] just continue on but that's not what but
[1:30:54] that's not the whole quote
[1:30:55] because he says comma
[1:30:57] but the person of christ performing in
[1:30:59] you the same works that he did and my
[1:31:02] question is now the book of acts
[1:31:04] is it the acts of the apostles or is it
[1:31:07] the acts of the holy ghost and the
[1:31:08] apostles is it the acts of jesus and the
[1:31:11] apostles amen and it was so we see when
[1:31:14] the
[1:31:15] day of pentecost had fully come their
[1:31:17] jubilee was coming now amen when they
[1:31:19] staggered out of the upper room you know
[1:31:21] the people you know others mocked saying
[1:31:23] these men are full of new wine and
[1:31:25] actually in truth they were full of new
[1:31:27] one because new wine has life and it's
[1:31:30] still still fermenting i mean so they
[1:31:32] were they were they were full of new
[1:31:34] wine hallelujah they were stimulated
[1:31:37] because they recognized that god had
[1:31:38] done something for them amen that they
[1:31:41] would actually be made free indeed and
[1:31:43] that's why when when peter stood up he
[1:31:45] said he said ye men of judea and all
[1:31:48] them that dwell at jerusalem be this
[1:31:50] known unto you but this is you know we
[1:31:52] are not full of new wine i mean we are
[1:31:54] not drunken as you supposing it's just
[1:31:56] about the third hour of the day
[1:31:58] but he says this is that spoken by the
[1:32:00] prophet joel that he'll pour his spirit
[1:32:01] out upon all flesh amen to peter went
[1:32:04] into the word and said this is that amen
[1:32:06] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:32:08] amen where the life of god would come
[1:32:10] into a people hallelujah that they'd be
[1:32:12] set free
[1:32:14] glory
[1:32:15] amen to you sorry he says he's saying
[1:32:17] he's saying we you know in a way they
[1:32:19] were drunk
[1:32:20] hallelujah amen because
[1:32:23] i remember when i used to drink i mean
[1:32:25] all the inhibitions go i mean
[1:32:27] conservative people who are quiet aren't
[1:32:28] so quiet anymore
[1:32:30] all the loud ones are still loud
[1:32:32] sometimes they go quieter hallelujah
[1:32:34] everyone just and then everyone forgets
[1:32:36] about maybe maybe how rich or poor they
[1:32:39] are their differences i mean and they're
[1:32:41] just all united by one thing
[1:32:43] hallelujah and they just enjoy what
[1:32:45] they're doing
[1:32:46] amen and if that is just the counterfeit
[1:32:48] what about the real
[1:32:50] holy where where people can come
[1:32:52] together and then and and then and they
[1:32:54] take off the mask they don't try and put
[1:32:56] up some kind of stand of well i'm a good
[1:32:58] christian everything's fine i remember
[1:33:00] they can just come and just be real amen
[1:33:02] then they can just be united and
[1:33:04] recognize the same life amen why do
[1:33:06] people yeah birds of a feather flock
[1:33:08] together
[1:33:09] people who like to drink whiskey they
[1:33:11] congregate together people like to drink
[1:33:14] beer they congregate together wine
[1:33:16] drinkers they congrat together and they
[1:33:18] have fellowship around what they're
[1:33:20] drinking
[1:33:21] hallelujah it's the same thing with the
[1:33:22] bride of christ i mean today the reason
[1:33:25] we are together is because we're
[1:33:26] drinking from the same fountain amen
[1:33:28] we're enjoying the same wine
[1:33:30] holy worst we're enjoying the same life
[1:33:33] hallelujah amen and we can we can
[1:33:36] rejoice in these things because it's a
[1:33:38] reality
[1:33:39] hallelujah that we are living in a time
[1:33:41] of refreshing
[1:33:42] amen a time of liberation for the people
[1:33:44] of god
[1:33:46] hallelujah this is this is this is the
[1:33:48] hour that we're alive in
[1:33:50] amen we're living in a time of
[1:33:52] refreshing where god is pouring out his
[1:33:54] spirit i mean god is opening his word
[1:33:57] hallelujah this is where we are
[1:34:00] amen that that truly we say our light
[1:34:02] has come
[1:34:03] amen we're not sitting in darkness
[1:34:05] i mean we're not stumbling around you
[1:34:07] know what does the bible say and how
[1:34:09] should we do things and and you know is
[1:34:11] there really a holy ghost we know the
[1:34:13] holy ghost is real amen we feel we're
[1:34:15] failed as quickening power
[1:34:17] amen we feel his reality amen harley we
[1:34:20] where you know you know how it is
[1:34:23] you know sometimes you can get a little
[1:34:25] dry
[1:34:26] and then you begin to compare yourself
[1:34:27] with other people and then you even
[1:34:29] begin to say well i wish i could do what
[1:34:31] they do out there but then when you come
[1:34:32] into the prince of god
[1:34:34] i mean all those things they just fade
[1:34:36] away and you say oh god i'm so glad i
[1:34:38] can come into your presence hallelujah
[1:34:40] i'm so glad that there's nothing between
[1:34:42] me and you anymore
[1:34:44] hallelujah and all you want to do is
[1:34:46] worship him
[1:34:47] holy why because there's a refreshing
[1:34:49] comes amen and the things that the devil
[1:34:51] tries to tack on to you they just washed
[1:34:53] away
[1:34:54] hallelujah they just washed away i mean
[1:34:56] a lake is not a lake you know the trash
[1:34:59] in the lake is not part of the lake
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:03] the lake is just clear water
[1:35:06] whatever life's in the lake but all the
[1:35:08] man-made stuff that's thrown in
[1:35:10] that's not part of the lake that's right
[1:35:12] and we have to recognize the things that
[1:35:14] we wrestle with
[1:35:16] they're not part of you
[1:35:18] amen they're not water they're not part
[1:35:19] of the lake
[1:35:21] hallelujah they're just they're just
[1:35:23] things that try and
[1:35:24] you know you know you know have you ever
[1:35:26] seen a lake i remember i was in papua
[1:35:27] new guinea
[1:35:29] where my parents were is active volcano
[1:35:32] and sometimes the sea would just be
[1:35:33] covered in pumice
[1:35:35] just your small small pumice you know it
[1:35:37] floats just just
[1:35:39] cover the whole bay
[1:35:41] just from the volcano
[1:35:43] now that's not part of the sea
[1:35:45] amen but it's something that's been
[1:35:47] added too
[1:35:48] and we know when you put trash when you
[1:35:50] put over the water it just blocks out
[1:35:52] the sunlight that's trying to go into
[1:35:54] the water amen but then if the sea tried
[1:35:58] to take ownership of that pumice well
[1:36:00] then the water's not i mean the light's
[1:36:01] not going to shine down
[1:36:04] amen and you need and you need light for
[1:36:06] life to be there
[1:36:08] amen
[1:36:09] so the same thing with us
[1:36:11] if the devil tries to put something on
[1:36:13] you as i said on wednesday he tries to
[1:36:15] put a shadow or a question across the
[1:36:17] word yeah he has god said and that's
[1:36:19] putting a shadow because remember in god
[1:36:22] is no darkness at all amen but the first
[1:36:25] question the first shadow he put on the
[1:36:27] word
[1:36:28] it was the serpent talking to eve yeah
[1:36:30] hath god said
[1:36:32] remember if your path is covered in
[1:36:33] shadows it's harder to see where you're
[1:36:35] going whether it's fully lit up you can
[1:36:37] just walk as bold as you want to
[1:36:39] hallelujah so don't let the devil try
[1:36:41] and put a shadow on your walk
[1:36:43] yay is the message really real
[1:36:46] we'll just go listen to the last 15
[1:36:48] minutes of virtually every service
[1:36:50] amen and he says if i be a true servant
[1:36:53] of god and if i've said the truth let
[1:36:55] him come and prove that it's true
[1:36:57] in front of thousands of people over and
[1:37:00] over again
[1:37:01] i was you know i was driving in my car
[1:37:04] it's hearing a prayer line he just
[1:37:06] called someone out of the audience this
[1:37:07] is your name this is your address you
[1:37:10] know
[1:37:11] you know you live at whatever whatever
[1:37:12] whatever whatever street in this city
[1:37:16] accurate
[1:37:17] you try you try and do that it'd be a
[1:37:20] it'd be an absolute
[1:37:23] you could never you know yo imagine the
[1:37:25] the the
[1:37:27] you know the statistical
[1:37:29] uh amount of zeros of the percentage
[1:37:31] chance of getting that right
[1:37:33] if you bring in thousands of people
[1:37:36] never seen before then you try and guess
[1:37:37] where they're from and their street
[1:37:39] number and why they're here
[1:37:42] i mean it was about four or five things
[1:37:44] just just listed down
[1:37:46] and you think no man can do that
[1:37:49] they didn't have wireless things and
[1:37:50] people talking and you know
[1:37:54] they didn't have that stuff they didn't
[1:37:56] cook it up
[1:37:57] i mean it was god
[1:37:59] and he was declaring i'm here to set my
[1:38:02] children free there's a time of
[1:38:03] refreshing that's here i mean you're
[1:38:05] living in a season where we're not
[1:38:06] slogging i'm glad we're not slogging
[1:38:08] down and you know you know down in the
[1:38:10] dark ages or or in luther's age or even
[1:38:14] the early pentecostal age or even when
[1:38:16] jesus was here
[1:38:17] sure it would have been wonderful to
[1:38:18] walk the shores of galilee but this is a
[1:38:21] greater day
[1:38:22] this is a greater day
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:26] we're we're where brother speaks about
[1:38:28] the bride coming of christ i mean god
[1:38:30] coming and dwelling in his children
[1:38:32] hallelujah
[1:38:34] that we wouldn't go down in death
[1:38:36] amen but the revival would continue
[1:38:38] burning on
[1:38:40] hallelujah until these bodies are
[1:38:42] changed
[1:38:43] hallelujah god is pouring his spirit out
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:47] don't miss what he's doing
[1:38:49] sometimes we we it's so simple
[1:38:53] but yet it's so you know but it doesn't
[1:38:55] change the fact that it's god
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:01] and that's why now
[1:39:04] i read there
[1:39:06] rejoice not against me oh my enemy when
[1:39:09] i fall i shall arise
[1:39:11] when i sit in darkness
[1:39:13] the lord shall be a light unto me amen
[1:39:16] amen and if
[1:39:17] it was a day
[1:39:19] where
[1:39:20] where there's darkness it's today
[1:39:23] but as if it was a day when there's
[1:39:25] light shining it's today
[1:39:27] amen there's never been a day like this
[1:39:29] day
[1:39:30] amen so just remember you may be sitting
[1:39:32] in darkness
[1:39:33] you know the devil may have because
[1:39:35] remember the enemy at the end is not a
[1:39:37] person
[1:39:38] amen it's a spirit anointing a person
[1:39:41] that is the enemy
[1:39:43] amen if you look through carnal eyes you
[1:39:44] say it was this person this person and
[1:39:46] this person no if you look through
[1:39:48] spiritual eyes it'd be it's satan it's
[1:39:51] satan it's satan
[1:39:52] i mean it's it's not your brother or
[1:39:54] sister or family or or person whoever it
[1:39:57] is it's the devil
[1:39:59] amen and then you can say in your heart
[1:40:01] rejoice not against me my enemy
[1:40:04] amen
[1:40:05] when the light
[1:40:07] when i when i sit in darkness the lord
[1:40:10] shall be a light unto me when i fall i
[1:40:13] shall arise
[1:40:15] hallelujah and we know we understand
[1:40:18] this is a day where the scripture has
[1:40:20] been fulfilled arise and show
[1:40:23] for thy light has come and the glory of
[1:40:24] the lord has risen upon thee
[1:40:27] hallelujah this is the day where this
[1:40:28] scripture has been fulfilled amen
[1:40:30] refreshing has been poured out amen
[1:40:33] amen as always always remember if the
[1:40:36] devil's trying to
[1:40:37] bog you down
[1:40:39] you know
[1:40:40] say don't rejoice against me my enemy
[1:40:43] i shall arise
[1:40:45] hallelujah
[1:40:46] this bride is rising up
[1:40:48] amen i'm talking about around the world
[1:40:51] the bride is rising up in power
[1:40:54] hallelujah
[1:40:55] i mean individually it's not it's not
[1:40:57] just a prophet it's a many-membered body
[1:41:00] amen we can come together and love and
[1:41:02] function as a as as as one body one mind
[1:41:05] and one accord
[1:41:07] hallelujah
[1:41:08] that's why it's important the scripture
[1:41:10] says to confess your faults one to
[1:41:12] another
[1:41:13] not your sins your sins are to god but
[1:41:14] your faults you confess one to another
[1:41:16] why is that that we can pray one for
[1:41:18] another it's not some gossip channel or
[1:41:20] this person that doesn't no no no it's
[1:41:22] not that it's going to someone saying i
[1:41:24] need prayer for this
[1:41:26] amen and if they're a spiritual person
[1:41:28] they won't condemn you for it or put you
[1:41:30] down a little bit they'll say this
[1:41:32] person you know a person who bottles
[1:41:34] things up i'll say this
[1:41:36] is actually carnal that's right amen
[1:41:39] and it may be not there
[1:41:41] it's the environment they're in has
[1:41:43] caused them to become this way but
[1:41:45] someone who's actually spiritual can
[1:41:47] actually recognize
[1:41:49] this is the devil trying to bog me down
[1:41:52] i'm a son or daughter of god i'm not
[1:41:54] meant to be bogged down by these things
[1:41:56] this is not my inheritance and but then
[1:41:58] the devil's warring against me
[1:42:00] and so a spiritual person will go to
[1:42:02] another one and say i'm i'm fighting
[1:42:05] this
[1:42:06] i'm wrestling this
[1:42:08] pray pray with me amen that's a
[1:42:10] spiritual person amen
[1:42:12] amen
[1:42:14] hallelujah
[1:42:15] that's absolutely a spiritual person
[1:42:17] because because if someone comes to you
[1:42:19] and say i need prayer for this if you're
[1:42:21] spiritual about it you'll recognize this
[1:42:23] is a son
[1:42:24] or a daughter of god coming to me
[1:42:26] amen and they're not really trying to
[1:42:28] contact me they're trying to for me
[1:42:30] they're trying to contact the god in me
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:35] and so
[1:42:36] you should be able to reckon you know
[1:42:37] it's like it's like israel fighting
[1:42:40] different tribes are fighting whatever
[1:42:41] they're doing different tribes went to
[1:42:43] help different tribes fighting
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:46] it didn't you know and so we're to help
[1:42:48] one another
[1:42:49] and that's why we're built differently
[1:42:52] some people are more prayer worry some
[1:42:54] people are not
[1:42:55] it doesn't mean one is less spiritual
[1:42:56] than the other one
[1:42:58] amen it doesn't mean that the one is
[1:43:00] greater you're like which is greater
[1:43:01] peter who stood there with boldness and
[1:43:03] preached to thousands
[1:43:04] or one of the other apostles that was a
[1:43:06] real prayer warrior
[1:43:08] who was greater well some people can't
[1:43:11] leave they look at peter say oh i wish i
[1:43:13] could be peter stand there like a line
[1:43:15] of boldness and then and lay down the
[1:43:17] truth
[1:43:18] but a spiritual would say lord whatever
[1:43:20] you make me i want to be part of your
[1:43:21] body
[1:43:22] i mean and the function that i meant to
[1:43:24] function in
[1:43:26] amen
[1:43:29] so our light shining
[1:43:32] remember
[1:43:35] when i fall
[1:43:37] i shall arise
[1:43:39] amen and that's why it says i'm not sure
[1:43:41] i think it's in galatians i might be
[1:43:42] wrong
[1:43:43] that when someone when a backslide sign
[1:43:45] comes back restore them in this i think
[1:43:48] uh yeah i might be totally wrong with
[1:43:49] the scripture but it says restore in a
[1:43:51] spirit of meekness
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:54] so we have to be able to recognize
[1:43:57] that
[1:43:58] if someone falls
[1:44:00] in any way
[1:44:02] it is the devil that is that has twisted
[1:44:04] them in some way and dragged them out
[1:44:07] amen you have to you have to look
[1:44:10] you have even even if they made the
[1:44:11] choice to do it
[1:44:13] amen you have to look beyond
[1:44:15] well that person deserves this and they
[1:44:17] have to do penance and they have to do
[1:44:18] whatever more no
[1:44:20] restore them if they if they genuinely
[1:44:23] repented about it they're sorry about it
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:27] we should you should be able to look and
[1:44:28] even if they're going in the wrong
[1:44:30] direction
[1:44:31] if you've got christ in your heart you
[1:44:32] won't condemn them for the direction
[1:44:34] they're going in
[1:44:35] i remember you'll pray for your brother
[1:44:37] you'll pray for your sister because if
[1:44:39] remember the if the lights come to you
[1:44:41] you'll want to shine it to someone else
[1:44:44] amen why did why did gideon blow the
[1:44:47] horn and shine the light
[1:44:48] i mean to sit to set the whole nation
[1:44:50] free
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] and if our light is shot
[1:44:55] a lot you know you know we're called to
[1:44:58] shine the light and sound the trumpet
[1:45:00] that that others would come into a time
[1:45:02] of refreshing as well
[1:45:04] i mean because unless people recognize
[1:45:06] what's going on they can't be part of it
[1:45:09] amen
[1:45:11] so we must always
[1:45:13] and and i'll just close with this you
[1:45:15] know
[1:45:16] always look
[1:45:19] don't look at the person
[1:45:21] remember because if we've been awakened
[1:45:24] we want others to be awakened
[1:45:26] you know if we want yo if we enjoy the
[1:45:28] praise of god it's automatically now i
[1:45:31] want others to
[1:45:33] to enjoy the presence of god
[1:45:34] and if i'm walking in victory i want
[1:45:36] others to walk in victory
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:41] and so
[1:45:43] we must always look beyond what we see
[1:45:47] and
[1:45:48] look at people and say they are the
[1:45:50] bride
[1:45:51] they may be wrestling with things
[1:45:54] because sometimes we can walk
[1:45:55] we can have years of
[1:45:57] light uh yeah you know what brother ram
[1:45:59] says families everything's in cycles
[1:46:02] families have cycles you have a day time
[1:46:05] everything's going well there's suddenly
[1:46:06] a night cycle after a family and
[1:46:08] everything's kind of falling apart
[1:46:10] and then there's another day breaks
[1:46:12] so sometimes you have good times and bad
[1:46:14] times
[1:46:15] it doesn't mean you're suddenly walking
[1:46:16] in unbelief sometimes you just darkness
[1:46:18] comes and the devil fights you in all
[1:46:20] these different things
[1:46:22] amen
[1:46:23] so you got to recognize it for what it
[1:46:24] is amen and then pray accordingly
[1:46:28] and talk to that person accordingly
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:32] because
[1:46:33] sometimes
[1:46:35] sometimes we should say you know you
[1:46:37] should know better
[1:46:39] but some but you forget you should have
[1:46:41] known better whenever something happens
[1:46:42] sometime
[1:46:44] amen
[1:46:45] so you gotta you gotta approach it the
[1:46:47] right way
[1:46:48] that's right you understand
[1:46:52] amen could we have some musicians to
[1:46:53] come please
[1:46:56] amen
[1:46:57] because
[1:46:59] you know we don't just want to
[1:47:02] sometimes if we take the wrong approach
[1:47:05] we take the wrong approach because we're
[1:47:06] looking at the wrong way
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:11] does it say
[1:47:15] we should pray one for another
[1:47:19] not in a gossip way
[1:47:20] because some people go to prayer
[1:47:22] meetings just to hear the gossip
[1:47:24] they do there's always going to be
[1:47:25] people like that unfortunately but then
[1:47:27] others go because they want to really
[1:47:29] pray
[1:47:30] because they see because if part of the
[1:47:32] body you know if i have an infection in
[1:47:34] my hand
[1:47:35] the rest of my body is suffering
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:39] and then if the infection gets worse and
[1:47:40] the rest of my body will get worse
[1:47:43] amen or if i have a wound or something
[1:47:45] that's the same thing with us
[1:47:46] collectively
[1:47:48] if part of the bride is hurting we're
[1:47:49] actually all hurting
[1:47:51] amen but then what happens is if we look
[1:47:53] at it carnally we say well that's just
[1:47:55] that church and that's their problem
[1:47:56] this is you know we're not like them but
[1:47:59] you got to recognize they're part of you
[1:48:00] you're part of them
[1:48:02] amen
[1:48:04] so we have to you know we have to look
[1:48:06] beyond
[1:48:08] boundaries and and oh that's that family
[1:48:10] you know that person was always that way
[1:48:12] you know no no don't don't look at that
[1:48:15] i mean look at you've got to look at the
[1:48:17] fact that
[1:48:18] it's the devil fighting that person
[1:48:21] amen this is a time of refreshing a time
[1:48:23] of jubilee
[1:48:24] and maybe they just haven't fully that's
[1:48:26] right you know come into that jubilee
[1:48:28] yet amen amen
[1:48:32] amen
[1:48:33] let's just let's just pray shall we
[1:48:36] gracious lord jesus

[1:50:12] glory dear lord father we just want to
[1:50:15] commit this time into your hands
[1:50:17] dear lord help us to look through your
[1:50:19] eyes
[1:50:20] father when you looked at the woman at
[1:50:21] the well you didn't condemn her for
[1:50:23] where she was
[1:50:24] but you saw you said i need to go by the
[1:50:26] way of samaria
[1:50:28] because there was someone that hadn't
[1:50:29] seen the light yet there was one of your
[1:50:31] ordained children that needed to walk
[1:50:33] free and far that's why you went there
[1:50:35] lord you saw a predestinated seed
[1:50:37] sitting in that woman
[1:50:38] and father we thank you lord you didn't
[1:50:40] bring into account her formal life lord
[1:50:42] there wasn't even part of it lord her
[1:50:44] sins didn't really mean anything to you
[1:50:46] lord it didn't cause you to back up or
[1:50:49] or even even resist going there he said
[1:50:51] i need to go there father because there
[1:50:54] was one that needed liberation there oh
[1:50:56] god there's one that needed to feel the
[1:50:58] refreshing they were sent from your
[1:50:59] presence oh god and father may we see

[1:51:06] they haven't experienced you yet oh god
[1:51:08] father that faith lord will be more than
