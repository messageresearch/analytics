[41:14] this service Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[41:17] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[41:19] have your seats uh this morning so I
[41:22] want to I want to continue a bit on from
[41:24] from uh uh last Sunday about how the
[41:27] Lord is our absolute the word of God is
[41:29] our absolute amen above opinion or ideas
[41:32] of man or uh you know our feelings even
[41:35] but but his word is our absolute now if
[41:37] we look into the scripture here I want
[41:39] to speak about the uh the eagle
[41:41] anointing that's coming this day of the
[41:42] Holy Ghost and and we have read here in
[41:45] Isaiah 59 that the Lord actually places
[41:48] the scripture in the end time because he
[41:50] says that so they that fear the name of
[41:52] the Lord from the West so there's a
[41:54] position that's all this is significance
[41:56] you see because Isaiah is standing here
[41:58] prophesying this he's in the East so
[41:59] he's saying that so so so there's
[42:01] something that's going to come from the
[42:02] West that's going to bring the fear of
[42:04] the Lord and His glory from the rising
[42:06] of the sun now we understand that that
[42:08] that we live in a season of a rest
[42:10] restoration of all things that was
[42:12] prophesied in the Bible so there' be a
[42:15] restoration of a bride a church coming
[42:17] back to a true Pentecostal book of Acts
[42:20] life amen with a where the spirit of God
[42:22] doesn't just anoint them but lives in
[42:24] them manifests his word through them so
[42:26] there's so saying this it's from his
[42:28] glory from the rising of the sun now I
[42:30] don't think it was a haphazard thing
[42:32] that brother Bram would preach a sermon
[42:33] it is the rising of the sun saying now
[42:36] that we live in a season where where
[42:38] where there was a night time but now the
[42:39] sun is rising there's a restoration now
[42:42] and me you know it's like there's a
[42:43] reason why the Middle Ages was called
[42:45] the Dark Ages amen because we know the
[42:47] church at um uh you know under
[42:51] persecution you under Rome and all these
[42:53] things went down into the ground for
[42:54] about a thousand odd years and there
[42:56] wasn't a lot of movement of the spirit
[42:58] of God the you know but God said I will
[43:00] restore and then we know that you know
[43:02] Martin Luther and the Reformation came
[43:04] but it would come a but but that was a
[43:06] day of of uh you know man's Creed still
[43:09] mixed in with the word of God but then
[43:11] God said there'll be another day come
[43:13] where where it'll be restoration back to
[43:15] the first day again so when the when so
[43:17] when the prophet said you know he he
[43:19] made the announcement it is the rising
[43:20] of the sun he's saying that now now
[43:23] there's we've gone back to that first
[43:25] day again when the spirit of God Has
[43:26] Come back into the Earth in its full
[43:28] power am mean where the Creeds of man
[43:30] are no longer lifted up but now the word
[43:32] of God is lifted up amen that that
[43:35] everything they had back in the book of
[43:36] Acts has been restored back into the
[43:38] church so we are living in this day amen
[43:40] so so something that would come from the
[43:42] West we could see I'm sorry I'm probably
[43:44] covering a lot of things just as a pre
[43:45] thing but you look at Revival how it
[43:47] went from Jerusalem and went West right
[43:49] and now the gospel's gone to the West
[43:51] Coast of of America now it's gone back
[43:53] East again so something happened what
[43:55] what happened in the west the seal came
[43:57] open the quickening power came back into
[43:59] the church amen but it also says and the
[44:01] Redeemer shall come to Zion so it's not
[44:04] just not just a uh sorry um so so who is
[44:08] Zion now we know Zion speaks of the
[44:09] Bride so so the Redeemer shall come
[44:12] dwell in his people now he says here
[44:14] when this happens then the enemy shall
[44:16] come in like a flood now I was sitting
[44:19] in Sunday School uh this morning and
[44:22] sister Shantel brought this out very
[44:23] well a flood is just a lot of water a
[44:25] trickles not much water so the enemy
[44:27] will come in in a great abundance right
[44:30] so the enemy's always been here we know
[44:32] we know that right but but he says the
[44:34] enemy shall come in like a flood now um
[44:38] we know as Bible readers that if you
[44:39] look into Revelations chapter 9 the
[44:42] enemy comes in like a flood when the
[44:43] bottomless pit comes open and it's it's
[44:46] between the first and second war or the
[44:47] first or second world war the enemy is
[44:50] coming like a flood but the Lord said
[44:52] I'll lift up a standard against him amen
[44:54] so the so the Lord has never left his
[44:56] people people unable to overcome the
[44:59] enemy he's never left us helpless
[45:01] hopeless you know never left us just
[45:03] with an intellectual understanding to
[45:05] try and combat the devil with his Spirit
[45:07] has always been upon the Earth Amen to
[45:10] overcome in whatever age amen and in
[45:12] this age he said the Lord said I'll lift
[45:14] up a standard now when a standard is
[45:16] raised it's placed in a place of
[45:18] preeminence it's lifted high right it's
[45:20] not placed on the ground is lifted High
[45:22] amen and we know standard is a place if
[45:24] you you know look at old medieval
[45:26] battles and things the Roman times they
[45:27] would have standards that the men would
[45:29] rally around and it was a great shame if
[45:32] their standards were captured by the
[45:33] enemy so was a place that they could
[45:35] lift up they could look above the chaos
[45:37] of the battlefield and they could see
[45:39] where their standard was if their
[45:41] standard would retreat they would
[45:42] Retreat if it went forward they went
[45:44] forward with the colors because they had
[45:46] to to protect that standard and where
[45:48] that standard was was was where the men
[45:50] were meant to be now the Lord Has Lifted
[45:52] up a standard in this day he has made
[45:54] his word he's lifted up his word in this
[45:56] end time
[45:57] am mean to make the promises more real
[45:59] make them more tangible make them make
[46:01] them you know I'm so thankful we don't
[46:03] sit here with a spirit of unbelief
[46:05] saying the days of Miracles is passed
[46:07] amen but now we are sitting here with a
[46:09] with a heart saying Lord You're the same
[46:11] yesterday today and forever every
[46:13] promise you've given is Yan amen for
[46:15] this day amen we're not looking for
[46:16] something in the future to come but
[46:18] you've already revealed the truth of
[46:19] your word amen so we're not looking for
[46:22] well I wish I lived back there with the
[46:24] apostles I say thank you Lord that
[46:26] you're the same God back there you're
[46:27] the same God today hallelujah amen so
[46:31] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[46:33] he'll lift up a standard he'll he'll
[46:35] prove his word amen is right it works
[46:39] amen it will be set in a place of
[46:41] preeminence and I trust as Christians
[46:43] this morning his word has a place of
[46:45] preeminence in our lives I mean it's not
[46:47] a it's not a lucky rabbit's foot it's
[46:49] not you know you don't just call upon
[46:51] the Lord when you know you're in trouble
[46:53] you have a time of need but you call
[46:54] upon him all the time because he's
[46:56] number one in your life I remember
[46:58] before I became a Christian it was only
[46:59] in time of trouble I'd really call upon
[47:01] the Lord I remember when my parents
[47:03] lived in American SAR a cyclone came
[47:05] through flattened all the trees where we
[47:08] lived apart from the coconut trees and
[47:10] the next morning after this thing came
[47:11] through we had to go with machetes and
[47:13] and and cut down all the Fallen trees so
[47:15] my dad could get out and go see if his
[47:17] workplace was still there and I remember
[47:19] calling upon the Lord when I'm imagine
[47:21] that you're in this you're in this
[47:22] Cyclones gone through these big massive
[47:24] gusts are blowing through so much noise
[47:27] of the wind going through the trees and
[47:29] the things above you are coconut trees
[47:31] and they're Laden with coconuts one of
[47:33] those things would take you out I was
[47:35] calling on the Lord cutting trees and
[47:38] looking and you know all this but it was
[47:40] he was like a lucky rabbit's foot to me
[47:43] it was only in time of trouble I called
[47:46] upon him right but then after that well
[47:48] I forgot about him went back into my
[47:50] life and back into the world and all
[47:51] these things but you see now when you
[47:53] let him become number one in your life
[47:55] and he transforms your life life changes
[47:57] you fills you with the Holy Ghost he's
[47:59] number one all the time he's not just a
[48:02] god of convenience he's God over
[48:04] everything
[48:05] hallelujah amen so we're living in a day
[48:08] where the standard of the word of God
[48:11] has been has been raised into a place of
[48:14] of of preeminence in our lives this is
[48:16] what this message came to do amen will
[48:18] show that Jesus Christ is the same
[48:19] yesterday yesterday today and forever
[48:21] you know to show that Divine Healing
[48:23] Works show that God has still what he
[48:25] promised in his word to do set gifts in
[48:27] the church come live in the people's
[48:29] lives amen give overcoming power over
[48:32] sin amen it is still right here today
[48:35] praise the Lord amen so Zion we
[48:38] understand as the bride so when the Lord
[48:40] does this he won't just raise up a
[48:41] standard but he'll come living his
[48:43] people he will come to Zion trust he's
[48:45] come to you this morning am mean he
[48:47] lives in your heart he's given you an
[48:49] anointing am mean of his presence amen
[48:51] now we're just going to I thought it was
[48:53] interesting that we sung the Revelation
[48:55] song uh before service now we don't talk
[48:57] about we never you know plan all these
[48:59] things but you know we're just going to
[49:01] go to Revelations chapter 4 because I
[49:02] want to talk about the eagle anointing
[49:05] um that that is upon the
[49:07] church excuse me we're just going to do
[49:09] a bit of reading this morning so we're
[49:10] just going to go to Revelations uh 4 and
[49:13] and two just to set the scene
[49:19] here this is John he's on the spirit of
[49:22] the Lord's day he's caught up amen uh
[49:24] into the throne room of God and he
[49:26] begins to see see as a
[49:29] um symbolically everything up there CU
[49:32] because a book of symbols and a book of
[49:33] Prophecy is the Book of Revelation now
[49:34] in Revelations 4:2 says immediately I
[49:37] was in the spirit and behold there was a
[49:39] throne set in heaven and one sat on the
[49:41] throne and he that was sat um and he
[49:43] that sat was to look upon like Jasper
[49:45] and the Sardine um sardin Stone and
[49:49] there was a rainbow round about the
[49:50] throne in the sight like unto an emerald
[49:52] and round about The Throne were 4 and 20
[49:54] elders and upon the seats I saw four and
[49:56] and 4 and 20 Elders sitting clothed in
[49:58] white rment and they had on their heads
[50:00] crowns of gold and out of the throne
[50:02] proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and
[50:04] voices and there were seven lamps of the
[50:06] fire um of fire burning Before the
[50:07] Throne which are the seven spirits of
[50:09] God now we know that God is one Spirit
[50:12] but it's seven you know God pouring out
[50:15] his spirit in seven different manners
[50:17] right or by measure I should say instead
[50:19] of without measure now here we are and
[50:21] Before the Throne there was set a um a
[50:22] sea of glass like under crystal in the
[50:25] midst of the throne and round about the
[50:26] Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[50:28] before and behind now this is important
[50:30] because when we come to the seals and
[50:32] the moving of the Antichrist there's an
[50:34] order that these beasts come out to
[50:36] combat okay this is why I'm reading this
[50:37] and Before the Throne there was this um
[50:39] sorry and the first Beast was like a
[50:41] lion and the second beast was like a
[50:43] calf and the third Beast had a face as a
[50:46] man and the fourth Beast was like a
[50:48] flying eagle okay so keep that in your
[50:50] mind maybe maybe I'll just put this up
[50:52] here we'll just we'll just keep that up
[50:54] shall we just as a picture and then if
[50:56] you in your Bibles you want to go to go
[50:58] to Revelations chapter 6 now it says
[51:01] when the lamb would take the book and
[51:02] open the seals oh sorry here is me
[51:04] leaving this and I'm changing things
[51:06] okay he says uh one of the one of the
[51:09] four boy sorry and and I heard as it
[51:10] were the noise of Thunder one of the
[51:12] four beasts saying come and see and
[51:14] behold and I saw and behold a white
[51:16] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[51:18] and a crown was given unto him and he
[51:20] went forth conquering and to conquer now
[51:22] if you look at the symbology of this
[51:24] white horse rider and you look at
[51:26] Revelations chap 19 you can go away
[51:28] there's a bit of homework you can see
[51:29] that they they're not the same person
[51:32] because here we've read about a about
[51:34] about a rider he's given a bow no arrows
[51:37] and he and he was crowned and he went
[51:40] forth conquering to conquer but then
[51:41] Revelations 19 we have we have a white
[51:44] horse rider his his his Visage is I mean
[51:47] his vestments are dipped in the you know
[51:49] in the blood of God his name is called
[51:51] the word of God a sharp two-edged sword
[51:53] goes out of his mouth he's crowned with
[51:55] many crowns so one has no your one Crown
[51:58] a bow no arrows No Name the other one
[52:00] has a name the word of God many crowns
[52:02] and it's sharp to it saw comes out of
[52:04] his mouth so the one of Revelations 19
[52:06] is Christ This one is not this is the
[52:09] Antichrist riding forth but you see
[52:11] before this rider ever rides forth now
[52:14] one of the Beast has come and see okay
[52:16] so now the second one says and I had
[52:18] this and and I opened the second seal
[52:20] and I heard the second beast say come
[52:22] and see now I'm just going to skip down
[52:25] here to to to verse 5 and when he had
[52:27] opened the third seal I heard the third
[52:29] Beast say come and see okay and then now
[52:32] verse 7 and when he opened the fourth
[52:34] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[52:36] Beast say come and see now all this is
[52:38] significant now here the first Beast
[52:41] that we read about in Revelations
[52:42] chapter four was a lion so now when the
[52:44] Antichrist Spirit rode forth because
[52:46] John said the Antichrist spirit is
[52:47] already in the world so God never leaves
[52:50] his people unequipped to overcome what
[52:52] the enemy is doing never never never
[52:54] this is you know if you don't get
[52:55] anything out of the serice but that God
[52:57] you've equipped me to overcome in my age
[52:59] amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[53:01] You' have poured out in this age is more
[53:03] than enough to overcome my enemy okay so
[53:05] if that's all you get I'm happy about
[53:07] that okay you see so so so the first
[53:09] Beast had the face of a lion okay so so
[53:12] when this Antichrist deceptor Spirit
[53:14] rode forth you know there was a lion
[53:17] anointing of the Holy Ghost went out to
[53:18] combat it amen because you look at Paul
[53:21] he had a he had a real boldness about
[53:22] him even when even when that deceptive
[53:24] Spirit started to influence Peter who is
[53:26] a anointed Son of God filled with the
[53:29] Holy Ghost but he began to withdraw
[53:31] himself you know you know from eating
[53:33] with the Gentiles because Jews had come
[53:35] along he's being influenced by how women
[53:37] to be separated but you see when Paul
[53:39] heard about this and when and and spoke
[53:41] to Peter he was stood him face to face
[53:43] why it was a boldness about him it was a
[53:45] lion anointing to overcome what the
[53:47] white horse rider was doing of course
[53:49] Peter being a Son of God came out of
[53:51] that delusion and begin to and begin to
[53:53] eat with the Gentiles because we're all
[53:55] one body anyway amen but then what
[53:57] happened is is is with the second writer
[53:59] I didn't read it but you know it's now
[54:01] riding a white horse has been given a
[54:03] sharp toyed sword and makes war and all
[54:05] these things and if you look at church
[54:07] history then what happened is is is the
[54:09] Antichrist changed from just a deceptive
[54:11] Spirit now but then that you know that
[54:14] Spirit was crowned by Constantine and
[54:15] then and then the false church had had
[54:17] had political power behind it and there
[54:19] was a great martydom go on all those
[54:21] things so so what what did God give the
[54:24] church to overcome that was a a a beast
[54:28] of sacrifice anointing they gladly gave
[54:30] their lives they gladly went to the
[54:32] arena they gladly got tortured and it
[54:34] wasn't humanly them just their
[54:35] stubbornness saying I ain't going to bow
[54:37] it was an anointing upon them to
[54:40] overcome Hallelujah so so so they gladly
[54:43] gave their lives they weren't afraid of
[54:44] death because they realized that their
[54:47] last breath here would be their first
[54:48] breath over there am mean if you think
[54:50] about it when they went into the arena
[54:52] because it wasn't natural how they died
[54:54] with joy and that they rejoicing saying
[54:56] that were counted worthy I me to suffer
[54:58] like they you know suffer and give their
[55:00] lives if you think about before they
[55:01] went into the you know went into the
[55:03] arena maybe the you know maybe one of
[55:05] them you know this is just me but no
[55:07] doubt you'd see a line out there and
[55:09] something would anoint you and say soon
[55:11] and very soon I'm going to see the one I
[55:13] love this thing is just a gateway to get
[55:16] me to where I want to be I mean whom
[55:18] having not seen yet
[55:20] love
[55:21] hallelujah amen so they were given that
[55:23] Beast of sacrifice anointing of the Holy
[55:26] Ghost to overcome right but then but
[55:29] then what happened is is the um you know
[55:33] to to overcome the next move because
[55:35] what happened is then a black horse
[55:36] rider came forth now it's the same Rider
[55:38] all the time right he just changes how
[55:41] he does things okay and so so then the
[55:43] black horse rider came along with a
[55:45] scale in his hand and a measure of wheat
[55:47] for you know corn and all these things
[55:50] and but but then a voice came from the
[55:52] throne saying touch not the oil and the
[55:54] wine I mean so this is more than just an
[55:55] econom IC thing is actually is actually
[55:57] what happened is the church would say
[55:59] you've got to pay to have salvation
[56:01] you've got to you've got to pay physical
[56:03] money to get anything from God but then
[56:06] God anointed men like Martin Luther and
[56:07] even well before him John whitecliffe
[56:10] and you know they were like no the just
[56:11] shall live by faith it's your faith amen
[56:14] that you know justifies you not the
[56:16] money you pay not the Penance you do but
[56:18] it's your faith in Jesus Christ alone
[56:20] and that still stands today very much
[56:22] Hallelujah but so but but then that
[56:25] voice said from the the throne touch not
[56:27] the oil and the wine so there's no
[56:28] restriction now on the on the on the oil
[56:32] which is the anointing of God I mean
[56:34] because the anointing oil represented
[56:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[56:37] scripture so so don't touch that Satan
[56:40] you can't stop that and don't touch the
[56:42] wine which is a stimulation by the
[56:43] revelation of the spirit amen so so so
[56:46] now God actually because God always sets
[56:48] restrictions on his enemy amen with job
[56:51] right job you know God said to Job I
[56:54] mean God sorry Satan said to God about
[56:57] job he only worships you because
[56:59] everything's going fine for him so God
[57:01] set boundaries around Satan Satan you
[57:04] can touch everything he has but not him
[57:06] do you think Satan wouldn't have tried
[57:07] to push against that but he couldn't
[57:09] override God's commandment right and
[57:11] then Satan went uh went back up before
[57:13] God and God basically could have said to
[57:15] him I told you so because he knows the
[57:17] end from the beginning and you know and
[57:18] then Satan says well it's the only
[57:19] reason he still loves you is because
[57:21] he's got his health and then so God said
[57:23] to Satan okay you can afflict them but
[57:25] you can't kill him
[57:27] Satan went to the in you know to the
[57:29] very limit of that but God but he could
[57:32] not override God's commandment Glory we
[57:35] to realize friends that you know
[57:38] sometimes the accuser Goes Up Before the
[57:39] Throne of God and God testifies to his
[57:41] enemy about you saying have you ever
[57:44] have you considered my servant have you
[57:46] considered my bride there's none like
[57:48] them upon the Earth if God could testify
[57:50] of job being a perfect man under the
[57:52] blood of bulls and goats now how much
[57:54] more are people under the blood of Jesus
[57:56] Christ amen that the blood of Jesus
[57:57] Christ does more than just covers sin it
[58:00] annihilates sin it changes our nature
[58:02] amen the spirit of God comes and dwells
[58:03] in you hallelujah amen so remember
[58:07] you're going through a trial you're got
[58:08] to realize the devil's been set
[58:10] restrictions amen he can't override what
[58:13] God has allowed him to do amen and what
[58:15] God has allowed him to do will bring the
[58:16] glory of God into your life
[58:20] hallelujah amen but then you see now it
[58:23] was the wisdom of man with translating
[58:25] the Bible G the Bible into the hands of
[58:27] the people but then we've gone beyond
[58:29] that now to an eagle anointing the
[58:33] prophet tells us when the seals came
[58:34] open the eagle anointing begin to
[58:37] fly now I want you to think about this
[58:41] there's only one of those creatures that
[58:43] that is not
[58:44] Earthbound right all the others are
[58:46] Earthbound they can only see from the
[58:48] vage point they're standing at but an
[58:50] eagle can fly far high and it can see
[58:53] far right so this anointing that we have
[58:56] received of the Holy Ghost makes us see
[58:58] beyond even what other ages have seen
[59:02] right but then also it doesn't just
[59:04] cause us to see now I just want to come
[59:05] back to
[59:06] this I got it
[59:09] here I can find this it does more than
[59:13] just cause us to
[59:15] see it has a voice now how this is
[59:18] written is significant the first three
[59:20] writers it just says come and see I mean
[59:23] I mean mean I mean beasts right but the
[59:24] fourth one says and I heard the voice of
[59:26] the fourth Beast say come and see so
[59:29] this fourth Beast has a voice right now
[59:32] this is important because we got to
[59:33] realize we're not just passive in the
[59:36] battle right we're not just standing
[59:38] here yes I can see you know like we can
[59:40] see from eternity to Eternity amen when
[59:43] this anointing strikes you you can see
[59:45] you came from God you're going back to
[59:47] God am me before the foundation of the
[59:49] world like like job let's look at one
[59:51] Eagle who's sitting in a time of Crisis
[59:53] and God would come down and speak to him
[59:55] say where were you you job when I lay
[59:57] the foundations of the Earth where were
[59:59] you when the morning Stars s together
[1:00:01] that all the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:00:03] what was that job was sitting on an ash
[1:00:05] Heap but God anointed him to say look
[1:00:07] job I want you to know where you were in
[1:00:09] the beginning you weren't when I saw you
[1:00:11] in my mind job I did not see you as a as
[1:00:13] a man full of boils losing everything
[1:00:16] not understanding sitting on an ash Heep
[1:00:19] this is not how I dang you to be job
[1:00:20] you're just in a hickey called time and
[1:00:22] this is what the devil's come against
[1:00:24] you with but job I want you to realize
[1:00:26] this is how I saw you singing rejoicing
[1:00:29] around the Throne of God hallelujah and
[1:00:31] this how I saw you in the beginning is
[1:00:33] how how you going to end up in the End
[1:00:36] Amen because if God ordained us thus
[1:00:38] we're going to end up that same way sure
[1:00:39] we'll come through trials and troubles
[1:00:41] and tribulations and all these things
[1:00:43] but what God has ordained us to be we're
[1:00:45] going to end up that way Hallelujah and
[1:00:47] I just put there Revelation 22:21 it's a
[1:00:50] last scripture in the Bible right so God
[1:00:52] causes us to see right before the
[1:00:54] foundation of the world to the End Amen
[1:00:58] this is what this prophetic anointing
[1:00:59] does this why you know yeah I'm so
[1:01:01] thankful for this time this end time
[1:01:03] message we have received gives us such a
[1:01:06] stability that yes I'm in a trial yes
[1:01:08] all these things are going on but see
[1:01:10] we're not trying to we're not trying to
[1:01:12] overcome by the wisdom of man anymore
[1:01:15] the wisdom of man will never overcome
[1:01:17] the devil in this day the reasoning of
[1:01:19] your intellect will never overcome I
[1:01:22] mean remember Eve fell by reasoning in
[1:01:25] the garden
[1:01:26] right she reasoned against the word of
[1:01:28] God she fell because of reasoning that's
[1:01:30] why the Bible says cast down reasonings
[1:01:33] amen don't take see the devil always
[1:01:34] bring you a question yeah hath God said
[1:01:37] is it really that way is that really
[1:01:39] going to be that bad if you do this and
[1:01:41] this there's reasoning comes along
[1:01:43] what's that he's trying to get
[1:01:44] preeminence over your life he's trying
[1:01:46] to dominate your thinking amen but God
[1:01:48] has has anointed us that we can realize
[1:01:51] no matter what we're going through no
[1:01:52] matter what the struggle is the
[1:01:54] anointing of God is here to lift us out
[1:01:56] of that thing that we can see it for
[1:01:58] what it really
[1:02:00] is praise the Lord
[1:02:04] now an eagle can see further than any of
[1:02:07] these
[1:02:09] things faith has a long range Vision
[1:02:12] it's going to drop these things in this
[1:02:13] is this is how you're built remember an
[1:02:15] eagle's built to Sea and fly now brother
[1:02:17] Brown says and why Christ speak he says
[1:02:19] for you see Faith sees what God wants
[1:02:21] done oh I hope this goes in faith
[1:02:23] doesn't look at the present time Faith
[1:02:25] does doesn't see this here Faith sees
[1:02:27] what God wants and it works accordingly
[1:02:30] that's what faith does it sees what God
[1:02:32] wants and what God wants done and Faith
[1:02:34] operates through that faith is a long
[1:02:36] range
[1:02:37] Vision amen faith is a long range Vision
[1:02:39] an eagle has a long range Vision right
[1:02:42] so you're looking beyond the now aren't
[1:02:43] you thankful you can look beyond the now
[1:02:45] I mean it don't lower its sights it
[1:02:47] holds to the Target so Faith becomes how
[1:02:50] you when you look through eyes of faith
[1:02:52] when you look through eyes of Revelation
[1:02:53] it's done in your heart you've you know
[1:02:55] God has put it in your heart it's
[1:02:57] happening just like I he about Tamar
[1:02:59] revelate came from went from a hope so
[1:03:01] to a no so amen so what what's now faith
[1:03:04] has long range Vision don't look at the
[1:03:06] now and whatever you see now no the
[1:03:08] promis is she's coming home if I could
[1:03:11] just say it like that amen so Faith
[1:03:12] holds to that amen that's why it's so
[1:03:14] important when you're going through a
[1:03:16] battle get into the word of God and say
[1:03:18] Lord give me a revelation of your word
[1:03:20] help me to look through the situation
[1:03:22] through your word and not just something
[1:03:24] that I think is nice anchored into my
[1:03:25] Heart Lord what the promise is then then
[1:03:27] I can look through that and not through
[1:03:29] what My Five Senses declare not what my
[1:03:32] imagination conjures up not what my
[1:03:33] reasoning says are my affections but I
[1:03:35] can look through just through your word
[1:03:38] amen see it's got long range is a
[1:03:40] telescope it's a binocular uh that you
[1:03:42] don't look around here you don't use the
[1:03:44] binoculars to look to see what time it
[1:03:47] is see you don't use it like that but
[1:03:48] use binoculars to look away off and
[1:03:51] Faith does that Faith picks up God's
[1:03:52] binoculars both of them both sides the
[1:03:54] Old and New Testament and sees every
[1:03:56] promise that he made amen and Faith sees
[1:03:58] it out yonder and Faith chooses that
[1:04:00] regardless of what the present tense
[1:04:02] says here he looks at the end he don't
[1:04:04] drop his sights down to look at this way
[1:04:06] he looks out yonder and he keeps the
[1:04:08] cross here dead center on the word
[1:04:10] that's what faith does that's what
[1:04:12] that's the faith that's in a man that
[1:04:14] does those things I say that's the faith
[1:04:16] that's in a man woman or child that has
[1:04:17] this Eagle anointing amen looks to the
[1:04:19] end looks to the promise focuses you
[1:04:22] who's ever picked up binoculars and
[1:04:23] they're totally out of focus do you you
[1:04:25] just stand there and look at it like
[1:04:27] that just see a big fuzzy maybe two or
[1:04:29] three things no you you you focus it to
[1:04:33] what you're seeing is a clear image
[1:04:35] right and it's the same thing now with
[1:04:37] you and I you may be looking at the
[1:04:38] promise and it looks fuzzy it doesn't
[1:04:41] look like it's you know it doesn't make
[1:04:43] sense it seems very obscure what do you
[1:04:44] do you say Lord Focus me to your promise
[1:04:48] amen don't don't get frustrated at the
[1:04:50] binoculars amen but let God Focus your
[1:04:53] focus your binoculars that the promise
[1:04:55] becomes crystal clear and it jumps off
[1:04:57] the page amen let's let's let's look at
[1:05:01] an eagle here there you there's a few I
[1:05:03] want to come to us I feel like I'm
[1:05:05] running out of time but you know Abraham
[1:05:07] was an eagle he looked far beyond what
[1:05:11] was going on in the land amen when he
[1:05:13] met the Lord he began to look he met the
[1:05:16] maker of that City that he was looking
[1:05:18] for he met mesc and we know mesc was God
[1:05:21] without beginning a Days end of life
[1:05:23] without father or mother all these
[1:05:24] things you know you Paul picks it up
[1:05:26] makes it very clear he's Eternal the
[1:05:28] only one who's Eternal is God so Abraham
[1:05:31] met God he met the king of that City and
[1:05:33] so after he met the king of the city he
[1:05:35] be to looking for the city cuz Faith
[1:05:37] declared it was somewhere amen so he be
[1:05:40] to walk around the promised land where's
[1:05:42] that City I'm looking for the city he
[1:05:44] was an eagle he was looking far beyond
[1:05:46] because maybe he'd see someone you know
[1:05:47] talk to someone who didn't have this
[1:05:49] Eagle anointing and he'd say youo and
[1:05:51] you know this guy would ask him where
[1:05:52] are you going I'm looking for a city he
[1:05:55] look looking for ER you're looking for
[1:05:57] haran you're looking for Damascus you're
[1:05:59] looking for you know no I'm looking for
[1:06:01] a city that God built it's here
[1:06:03] somewhere and that person would look at
[1:06:05] Abraham and think that's a crazy old man
[1:06:08] he was the most sound-minded man in that
[1:06:10] whole planet am mean because he had an
[1:06:12] Eagle Vision and he was looking for that
[1:06:14] City now because he was looking for that
[1:06:16] City he wasn't caught up in all the
[1:06:18] Troubles of life it did not rule him it
[1:06:21] didn't mean he wasn't absent of trouble
[1:06:23] Abraham had a lot of trouble and strife
[1:06:25] going on but because he had an Eagle
[1:06:27] Vision he could look Beyond those things
[1:06:29] and say those things are just temporary
[1:06:31] I'm passing through them that's why when
[1:06:33] there was Strife between Abraham's
[1:06:35] herdsman and lot's herdsmen Abraham
[1:06:37] didn't say now listen lot God called me
[1:06:40] you're just coming here for a meal
[1:06:41] ticket you just I'm getting blessed and
[1:06:43] the reason you're blessed is because of
[1:06:45] me you take you take the second CL you
[1:06:47] you know you take the other pasture I'm
[1:06:49] getting the good stuff no he had Eagle
[1:06:52] Vision so so so when The Strife came up
[1:06:55] he just said to lot listen lot you just
[1:06:57] pick where to go I'll go the other way
[1:07:00] because what his his natural goods and
[1:07:03] what he had in this life wasn't his
[1:07:06] identity his identity was in the king of
[1:07:08] that City amen he was hallelujah amen so
[1:07:12] so that's why I said sure a lot you have
[1:07:14] the best but I'll go this way it's fine
[1:07:16] why cuz he was an eagle am mean he
[1:07:18] wasn't being caught up in the economics
[1:07:20] of the
[1:07:22] age there will be trouble there will be
[1:07:24] more trouble listen we're Eagles friends
[1:07:27] don't be troubled see this this whole
[1:07:29] world wants you to have a a a a
[1:07:32] Earthbound sight the opinions of man
[1:07:36] social media the news all these things
[1:07:38] that ain't Eagle Vision oh but the
[1:07:41] world's going to be you know people had
[1:07:42] so much hopes when when our government
[1:07:48] changed they ain't going to fix the
[1:07:50] world friends no one's going to fix the
[1:07:52] world the coming of Jesus Christ will
[1:07:54] fix this world
[1:07:56] amen so that's the only thing will
[1:07:58] help amen eagles look
[1:08:00] Beyond
[1:08:02] Hallelujah this got a couple more Eagles
[1:08:05] I got a couple of examples lilyia said
[1:08:07] make sure you put in lots of
[1:08:10] pictures I love my daughter any who here
[1:08:14] comes um this is this is Caleb and
[1:08:17] Joshua when they came back from
[1:08:19] searching out the land they gave the
[1:08:21] same report that the other 10 spies did
[1:08:24] but they said more than able to take it
[1:08:27] so so so Eagle vision sees the obstacles
[1:08:30] it's not some ostrich Vision that buries
[1:08:32] its head right Eagle vision sees the
[1:08:35] problems we don't we don't discount like
[1:08:37] sickness brother Ram says about a Cancer
[1:08:39] and you how can I overcome you don't
[1:08:41] deny you've got it sure you've got it
[1:08:43] but you got to realize the one in you
[1:08:44] has already overcome that thing
[1:08:47] Hallelujah that's real overcoming amen
[1:08:49] you realize whatever's come into my life
[1:08:51] the spirit of God within me has already
[1:08:53] overcome that thing amen cuz remember
[1:08:56] when he conquered HDE in the grave he
[1:08:57] conquered every enemy that can be named
[1:09:00] every enemy in existence has been
[1:09:02] conquered amen by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:04] whether it be unbelief sickness
[1:09:05] depression trouble mind battles whatever
[1:09:08] it is amen loneliness whatever it is
[1:09:10] it's been conquered amen by our Lord
[1:09:12] Jesus Christ am mean so Caleb and Joshua
[1:09:14] they said yes the walls are tall they
[1:09:16] are giants they're big there's big all
[1:09:18] those things but they were looking
[1:09:20] beyond that I mean they were looking to
[1:09:22] the promise of God saying but God has
[1:09:24] given us the land amen but the other 10
[1:09:26] spies they weren't they didn't have
[1:09:28] Eagle Vision they were Earthbound people
[1:09:30] saying we're grasshoppers in their sight
[1:09:33] we can never overcome see they were they
[1:09:35] didn't have the right kind of spirit but
[1:09:37] Caleb and Joshua did amen and when they
[1:09:39] were in the wilderness they weren't
[1:09:40] murmuring and complaining with the rest
[1:09:42] of Israel because they had Eagle Vision
[1:09:44] saying we are just passing through this
[1:09:47] Wilderness amen this is not our end
[1:09:50] destination sometimes a Wilderness can
[1:09:52] feel like it's a long time but you get
[1:09:54] to realize God's going to bring me of
[1:09:55] this thing I mean I'm not going to be
[1:09:57] here forever this is not my this is not
[1:09:59] my lotted Dwelling Place in the word of
[1:10:01] God but God's given me a land it's a
[1:10:03] good land of H you have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:05] moving of milk and honey and promises
[1:10:06] and the resurrection Hallelujah that's
[1:10:09] where God's given me that's where I'm
[1:10:10] going to dwell that's where I'm going to
[1:10:11] die as in Christ amen so they could look
[1:10:14] Beyond those things Hallelujah and where
[1:10:17] where did they end up Landing in their
[1:10:20] promise praise God they didn't discount
[1:10:23] the enemy but they said God's given it
[1:10:25] to to us amen let's go get it now
[1:10:28] Hallelujah an eagle can look beyond the
[1:10:30] emotion of what the church is even doing
[1:10:32] the church world is doing Micaiah would
[1:10:34] be there was King Ahab and King
[1:10:36] Jehoshaphat they went out to go they um
[1:10:39] they they wanted to go get back ramoth
[1:10:41] Gilead now it's interesting ramth gillad
[1:10:43] at once belonged to of course Israel the
[1:10:45] enemy had taken it and ramoth Gilead was
[1:10:47] a City of Refuge this was a significant
[1:10:49] loss to the to the Kingdom of Israel and
[1:10:52] so Ahab and Jehoshaphat they got
[1:10:54] together they said let's go let's go get
[1:10:56] back ramoth Gilead and so and so Ahab
[1:10:59] you know Jehosaphat asked for prophets
[1:11:01] to come and prophesy and you know Ahab
[1:11:03] had 400 Hebrew prophets and then so so
[1:11:06] they started to have a ministerial
[1:11:08] meeting and they got real enthused man
[1:11:12] they got excited they were jumping they
[1:11:14] were you know even the leader there so
[1:11:15] the guy in the right with his hands
[1:11:17] raised he's got some horns on his head
[1:11:19] even the whole leader of the whole
[1:11:20] church movement I mean made these made
[1:11:22] these iron horns and say by this you'll
[1:11:24] push the syrians out of the country they
[1:11:26] got super enthused but you see
[1:11:27] Jehoshaphat had a bit of Eagle about him
[1:11:30] he said thanks Ahab for these 400
[1:11:33] prophets they're Hebrew prophets now you
[1:11:34] go read the scripture but then he says
[1:11:36] do you have one more imagine the look on
[1:11:38] ahab's face who maybe would have turned
[1:11:40] slowly and look at him saying what do
[1:11:41] you mean one more I got you 400 here man
[1:11:44] they've said thus sayith the Lord we're
[1:11:45] going to go get the land but you see
[1:11:48] Jehoshaphat wasn't quite sure about
[1:11:49] their discernment and then so some of
[1:11:52] the servants went to go get there's one
[1:11:53] more Ahab said I got one more it's
[1:11:55] called called Micaiah but I hate him he
[1:11:57] never prophesies good he never preaches
[1:12:00] me
[1:12:04] Prosperity but Jehoshaphat said okay
[1:12:06] well but just go get him so mik is
[1:12:09] invited and as as Mike is making his way
[1:12:12] to this big meeting the servant or
[1:12:14] whoever came to go get him say look this
[1:12:16] is what's been happening in these
[1:12:17] Services M's been Dynamic has been
[1:12:19] powerful you see all the brothers are up
[1:12:21] and there's Unity the church world has
[1:12:22] come back together remember there's
[1:12:24] Civil War I mean there a division you
[1:12:26] know Israel was divided into two
[1:12:27] kingdoms look they're they're reuniting
[1:12:29] amen that that this that the city can be
[1:12:32] restored that this you the kingdom can
[1:12:34] go
[1:12:36] forward an eagle looks beyond that an
[1:12:40] eagle looks beyond a political religious
[1:12:42] move this is what this was an eagle can
[1:12:44] look beyond that Mah said look I'm only
[1:12:46] going to say what the Lord's told me as
[1:12:49] the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto
[1:12:50] me that will I speak so an eagle can
[1:12:52] look beyond the emotion and enthusiasm
[1:12:54] of something
[1:12:55] it can look well beyond how excited
[1:12:57] people are and all this Doctrine this
[1:12:59] truth and all these people get swept up
[1:13:01] in things he was an
[1:13:03] eagle so he prayed and he had a vision
[1:13:07] and in that Vision he saw a lying Spirit
[1:13:09] Come Out of Hell come up to heaven God
[1:13:12] was having a conference saying how can I
[1:13:14] get Ahab to come into battle that the
[1:13:16] words of my Prophet Elijah would be
[1:13:17] fulfilled remember Elijah what had you
[1:13:19] know had been taken up into Heaven by
[1:13:21] this stage and then so Micaiah came
[1:13:23] along Ahab you know you know before the
[1:13:25] king and then Micaiah you know
[1:13:27] sarcastically said go up the Lord's
[1:13:29] given you the victory and Ahab said to
[1:13:31] Jehoshaphat don't you see he always
[1:13:33] speaks evil against me and so Micaiah
[1:13:35] said listen I'll tell you what happened
[1:13:36] last night you got 400 prophets here
[1:13:39] you're all enthused you're all excited
[1:13:41] and they put a pressure on me to bow to
[1:13:43] what they're saying an eagle don't bow
[1:13:45] Eagle don't bow to human influence you
[1:13:48] see and this he said look last night I
[1:13:51] was praying I saw this evil spirit go
[1:13:53] into heaven because in heaven God was
[1:13:55] having a God was having a conference
[1:13:57] saying how can we cause Ahab to fall in
[1:13:59] battle to fulfill the words of Elijah
[1:14:01] this lying Spirit went up said I I'll do
[1:14:03] it can you imagine and then and then to
[1:14:06] the leader of this Ministerial
[1:14:07] Association smacked ma in the mouth
[1:14:09] saying from whence did the spirit of God
[1:14:11] come out of me and go unto you because
[1:14:14] because they they they took the
[1:14:15] anointing that they had received and
[1:14:17] they thought well this must be God we're
[1:14:19] all enthused we're here to that the
[1:14:20] kingdom will go forward but it was a
[1:14:22] lying Spirit and the problem is they
[1:14:24] never took their enthusiasm or their
[1:14:26] influence I mean or their inspiration
[1:14:28] back to the word of God but Micaiah
[1:14:30] being a true e um true Eagle could take
[1:14:33] his vision and subject it to the
[1:14:35] Prophecies of Elijah and he saw that
[1:14:38] Elijah's prophecy was Ahab Must Fall in
[1:14:40] battle that's why he could stand there
[1:14:42] in spite of all the opposition that he
[1:14:44] received he could stand there and say no
[1:14:46] God showed me this and then Ahab said
[1:14:48] take him into the inner prison and feed
[1:14:49] him the bread of Sorrow give him the
[1:14:51] water of sorrow and Mah said if God if I
[1:14:54] said ever see you again God never spoke
[1:14:57] to me he was an eagle can we stand like
[1:15:00] that can we can we subject our own even
[1:15:04] our own enthusiasm you get all excited
[1:15:06] about something can you subject it back
[1:15:08] to the word of God can you bring it back
[1:15:10] because remember this word is our
[1:15:12] absolute our feelings are not what other
[1:15:14] people say is not it's got to come back
[1:15:16] to the word of God and I guarantee you
[1:15:18] whatever you're going through in life
[1:15:20] you will find it in here amen that you
[1:15:22] can bring it back to your absolute and
[1:15:24] say well Lord is it is my I'm so excited
[1:15:26] Lord this is all I want in life but is
[1:15:28] it according to the
[1:15:29] word amen so Micaiah being an eagle
[1:15:33] could take his vision back to the word
[1:15:35] and say that's it I can stand on this
[1:15:39] hallelujah amen let's go to an eagle an
[1:15:42] eagle can live in any condition and walk
[1:15:45] with
[1:15:46] God now this is the you know if you go
[1:15:49] Google Patmos you know Patmos was uh you
[1:15:52] where John was in prison and it was it
[1:15:55] was not like the kind of semi- touristy
[1:15:57] place that is now there's nice hotels
[1:15:58] all those things but you see back in
[1:16:00] those days it was a Roman penal colony
[1:16:03] where where religious uh you uh whoever
[1:16:05] political prisoners whatever they got
[1:16:07] put on this island snake infested all
[1:16:09] these things so John was living in a
[1:16:12] prison but yet being an eagle he could
[1:16:14] walk with God being on this
[1:16:16] island amen Paul was the same way in
[1:16:19] prison but being an eagle he could he
[1:16:21] could you know God God gave him most of
[1:16:23] the New Testament while he was in prison
[1:16:25] Shackled to a
[1:16:27] Roman amen so an eagle can an eagle can
[1:16:30] live everywhere you know I think
[1:16:32] basically all our problems are first
[1:16:33] world
[1:16:34] problems really they're really not that
[1:16:38] bad we got to have perspective but you
[1:16:41] see now I'm just going to come back to
[1:16:43] this I will get to where I'm going I
[1:16:46] this time I'll get there but you see now
[1:16:48] in a chicken coup these chickens are
[1:16:51] Earthbound their wings being clipped
[1:16:53] they can't fly now
[1:16:56] we know that uh you know as I spoke
[1:16:58] about on New Year's Day in a chicken Co
[1:17:00] there's a pecking order and the pecking
[1:17:02] order is very important to the chickens
[1:17:05] right it's all about what you're
[1:17:06] entitled to people who fight always
[1:17:09] always fussing and picking each other
[1:17:10] and trying to bring other people down is
[1:17:12] because they feel entitled well this is
[1:17:14] mine I deserve
[1:17:16] this right Hallelujah Eagles don't live
[1:17:20] in a pecking order they respect other
[1:17:22] eagles they eat chickens
[1:17:25] is right but you see Eagles don't have
[1:17:28] this kind of picking order they saw they
[1:17:30] know you know their territories all
[1:17:32] those things but chicken but you see in
[1:17:34] a chicken coop like after that service
[1:17:35] brother Isaac said you know the chicken
[1:17:37] coop politics are very real to a chicken
[1:17:39] so not diminishing all these things but
[1:17:41] it's just a see the problem is is we
[1:17:44] live in an age of as as it would be
[1:17:47] written in the Book of Revelation it's
[1:17:49] the it's the age of Lady OA people's
[1:17:51] rights that's what lady oia means rights
[1:17:53] of the people right so everyone feels
[1:17:55] entitled this is not fair life's not
[1:17:58] fair how dare this happen to me I
[1:18:00] deserve better than this that's a that's
[1:18:02] a modern a modern way of looking at
[1:18:04] things CU you go back a hundred years if
[1:18:07] we all got transporter back there we'
[1:18:08] say man life is not fair and they look
[1:18:11] at you say what life is
[1:18:12] life right 10 years old milking cows
[1:18:16] cooking this working in the field with
[1:18:18] Dad hard labor all these things those
[1:18:21] children didn't say life's not fair they
[1:18:23] say well life is just life
[1:18:26] right but now it's a big entitlement
[1:18:27] what can I get that's a ladyo see in
[1:18:31] spirit right we shouldn't be fussing and
[1:18:33] fighting about all these things do you
[1:18:35] have life in your body do you have
[1:18:37] clothes on your back do you have a roof
[1:18:39] over your head do you have
[1:18:42] food amen have you got a sound mind do
[1:18:45] you love the Lord you got more than
[1:18:47] enough you're
[1:18:49] blessed amen so you got those things I'd
[1:18:52] just be happy everything else is a bonus
[1:18:54] but at least appreciate the bonuses
[1:18:56] don't say well I deserve it amen praise
[1:19:00] God nice food Hallelujah new clothes
[1:19:03] that's cool but you
[1:19:05] know don't let those we're not entitled
[1:19:08] to
[1:19:09] anything amen actually I could actually
[1:19:12] say it born in a fallen condition we're
[1:19:14] entitled to go to hell but God rich in
[1:19:17] Mercy amen broke the chains of sin off
[1:19:19] your life amen redeemed you amen before
[1:19:22] you even realize he purchased your
[1:19:23] salvation on Calvary amen so because of
[1:19:26] his blood because of what he's done I'm
[1:19:28] entitled to Heaven because of what he
[1:19:30] has done not what I have earned or
[1:19:31] deserved at all
[1:19:33] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:19:35] Lord so don't get caught up in a in a
[1:19:39] pecking order this person that person
[1:19:42] this I want this and this is not fair
[1:19:43] and this person this and forget that
[1:19:46] stuff I've been purchased by the blood
[1:19:48] of Jesus Christ everything else is a
[1:19:52] bonus praise the Lord
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:56] now an
[1:19:59] eagle this is a this is if I have it
[1:20:02] this is a South African eagle we used to
[1:20:04] have the biggest eagle in New Zealand
[1:20:05] they used to eat MOA but then they went
[1:20:07] extinct but they're big things okay but
[1:20:10] this is a um if I have it here somewhere
[1:20:12] this is a black breasted snake eagle and
[1:20:15] it's eating a cape Cobra on the
[1:20:17] wing
[1:20:19] eagles kill
[1:20:21] snakes right Eagles are territorial
[1:20:25] right so the snake isn't actually
[1:20:28] looking for the eagle the Eagle's
[1:20:29] looking for the snake amen so uh Eagle's
[1:20:33] got its territory and it gets a bit
[1:20:35] hungry and it sees this thing slithering
[1:20:37] in its patch what's this filthy snake
[1:20:41] doing on my patch what does it do it
[1:20:43] swoops down I was I actually watched a
[1:20:45] video you know the most they say the
[1:20:46] most poisonous snake in the world is is
[1:20:48] a is a sea snake you got the black and
[1:20:50] white banded one they're sea eagles and
[1:20:53] they swoop down and I saw more than one
[1:20:55] video and one Talon will crush the head
[1:20:57] of the serpent the other one will grab
[1:20:58] the body and up it flies away and eats
[1:21:00] on the thing Hallelujah same thing with
[1:21:03] this this is this is this is flying and
[1:21:06] eating at the same time right but you
[1:21:08] see now someone who's got an eagle
[1:21:10] anointing can see the serpent slithering
[1:21:13] around in its life and it don't put up
[1:21:15] with it it doesn't Pander that snake it
[1:21:19] don't feed that snake it don't feed a
[1:21:21] complex it don't feed a misunderstanding
[1:21:24] it don't feed or hurt amen come on Amen
[1:21:27] it don't feed it doesn't give excuse for
[1:21:29] why snakes in the life you say I was
[1:21:31] born this way my parents are this way
[1:21:33] and I've got bad jeans and stuff forget
[1:21:35] the jeans I mean you've got a jean the
[1:21:37] Jean seed of God in your soul that's the
[1:21:39] genan that counts
[1:21:41] hallelujah amen see you see now a snake
[1:21:44] though a snake needs something it needs
[1:21:47] friction to move so even if that snake
[1:21:50] was alive it couldn't move its body in
[1:21:53] the air to actually wrap itself around
[1:21:54] the eagle and come back to earth it
[1:21:56] needs something to push against it needs
[1:21:58] friction amen so a snake without
[1:22:01] friction cannot move now the natural
[1:22:03] types types are spiritual right am mean
[1:22:06] so a snake or a spirit needs a hurt or a
[1:22:09] trauma to work in it needs something to
[1:22:11] push against right it needs animosity to
[1:22:15] move it needs it needs a friction needs
[1:22:17] a it needs a there's a problem there's a
[1:22:19] resistance there's a trouble going on it
[1:22:21] needs those things to move and get a
[1:22:23] tighter grip he me it needs cality to
[1:22:26] move right it needs a reason to move it
[1:22:31] needs reasoning to move you take all
[1:22:34] those things out that snake can't move
[1:22:36] doesn't matter how big the thing is it
[1:22:38] ain't going to move right so if you get
[1:22:40] so sure we've all been hurt we've all
[1:22:42] had trauma I'm not diminishing anything
[1:22:44] we've gone through in life people have
[1:22:46] been through some terrible hard horrible
[1:22:49] things but God is the Healer God is the
[1:22:52] restorer I mean God quickening power can
[1:22:55] bring a healing into that thing amen
[1:22:57] doesn't matter how deep it may run how
[1:23:00] young it may have happened to you God
[1:23:02] can bring a restoration amen that God
[1:23:04] can use that as a testimony that his
[1:23:06] power can be manifested Hallelujah like
[1:23:09] Moses when they came out of the Red Sea
[1:23:10] they had a they had a good old
[1:23:11] Pentecostal meeting on the on the on the
[1:23:14] seashore dancing with the tambourines
[1:23:16] all these things and they walked for
[1:23:18] three days without water they came to a
[1:23:20] place where there was a bitter water of
[1:23:21] Mara Mara and then so they the children
[1:23:24] of Israel begin to complain why have we
[1:23:26] come to this bitter experience in our
[1:23:28] walk we've just had a great Victory but
[1:23:30] then Moses was inspired there was a tree
[1:23:32] on the side of the you know Pond bank or
[1:23:34] river bank or whatever it was Lake or I
[1:23:36] don't know you know he cut that tree
[1:23:37] down and he put it in the water and the
[1:23:39] water became sweet and Friends there's a
[1:23:42] cross there's a there's a tree of
[1:23:43] Calvary amen that you take any trauma
[1:23:46] any bitter experience you take it to
[1:23:48] Calvary you truly do it'll become sweet
[1:23:51] hallelujah how will become sweet you say
[1:23:53] Lord you brought me out of that thing
[1:23:54] thing Lord you didn't keep me in that
[1:23:55] bitter experience lord lord your power
[1:23:58] is more greater it's become sweet cuz
[1:24:00] Lord You're My deliverer You're My
[1:24:01] Healer you're my restorer Lord
[1:24:04] hallelujah I'm so thankful there's that
[1:24:06] tree amen Eagle anointing will identify
[1:24:08] that tree it's not psychology you make
[1:24:11] psychology with a bitter experience as
[1:24:13] it becomes more bitter because the depth
[1:24:15] and the height and the magnitude of it
[1:24:16] just gets Amplified but if you but if
[1:24:19] you get inspired by the word of God by
[1:24:21] the eagle anointing of the word you'll
[1:24:22] take Calvary mixer with an experience
[1:24:24] become
[1:24:25] sweet
[1:24:27] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:24:31] now that
[1:24:33] snake gives the Eagle Energy to
[1:24:36] fly
[1:24:38] hallelujah it's it's a that snake
[1:24:41] sustains the eagle isn't that
[1:24:44] strange how can a trial and a trouble
[1:24:46] and a devil trying to destroy me sustain
[1:24:49] me it gives you strength like Caleb
[1:24:52] would say he'd say it's only Rebel not
[1:24:55] against the Lord neither fear ye the
[1:24:56] people of the land for they are bread
[1:24:58] for us this is an eagle speaking am mean
[1:25:01] this is an eagle speaking amen these
[1:25:03] Giants they're bread amen they're going
[1:25:04] to give us strength amen they're going
[1:25:06] to sustain us amen they're going to give
[1:25:08] us power in the battle Hallelujah just
[1:25:10] like David another Eagle Saul wasn't an
[1:25:13] eagle he was one of God's children but
[1:25:15] he didn't have an eagle anointing he had
[1:25:16] a manage anointing a reasoning anointing
[1:25:18] because when Goliath came out he began
[1:25:20] to size them up and and and you know
[1:25:22] well he's that tall he's that tall I'm
[1:25:24] this tall no one else is that tall we
[1:25:26] can't do this that's reasoning kicking
[1:25:28] in but when David and eagle flew into
[1:25:30] the camp amen and then he heard the
[1:25:32] boast of that Philistine what did he do
[1:25:34] he says who is this uncircumcised
[1:25:36] Philistine he didn't say who is this
[1:25:38] giant who's this uncircumcised
[1:25:39] Philistine that defies the armies of the
[1:25:41] Living God Amen and then David began to
[1:25:44] testify to Saul Saul I've been eating a
[1:25:47] lion came against my father's sheep I
[1:25:50] killed it Hallelujah gave him strength
[1:25:52] amen and then a bear came a more
[1:25:54] powerful animal came in I killed it amen
[1:25:57] it gave me strength and this
[1:25:58] uncircumcised Philistine is will be
[1:26:01] exactly like them I mean every time God
[1:26:03] gave a testimony into David's life it
[1:26:05] gave him strength it became bread for
[1:26:07] him I mean that's why it's important you
[1:26:09] feel weak Draw on your testimony
[1:26:11] remember they remember the Bible says
[1:26:13] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:26:14] lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:26:17] what is the word of Our Testimony the
[1:26:18] word is right the word works the word is
[1:26:21] true the word is for me and this is what
[1:26:23] the word is done in my life Hallelujah
[1:26:27] that will give you strength for the
[1:26:28] battle amen you say man I've been
[1:26:30] through a lot I say man you're strong
[1:26:33] you've been eating some big big loaves
[1:26:35] of bread
[1:26:37] hallelujah praise the Lord so that eagle
[1:26:40] oh where we the eagle lives off the
[1:26:44] troubles that slither in its
[1:26:46] territory praise God you see you got a
[1:26:49] trial in your life Lord you're feeding
[1:26:52] me you're given me strength Lord
[1:26:54] that's why it works for your good count
[1:26:56] it all
[1:26:58] joy
[1:27:00] hallelujah amen praise the Lord now we
[1:27:02] just kind of let's let's just go to
[1:27:06] um let's go to
[1:27:08] Revelations chapter 3 quickly now just
[1:27:11] to go back quickly said the and I heard
[1:27:14] the voice of the fourth Beast say come
[1:27:16] and see so we know that that voice is a
[1:27:19] prophetic message in the end time this
[1:27:20] end time message is that voice of the
[1:27:22] fourth Beast right it's the spirit of
[1:27:23] God speaking forth a message to restore
[1:27:26] us back to the original Faith right now
[1:27:28] and and then you tie this in with the
[1:27:30] church anger says Now Behold I stand
[1:27:32] there a knock If any man hear my voice
[1:27:35] and open the door I will come into him
[1:27:36] and will s with him and he with me so
[1:27:39] now there's a there's a call coming to
[1:27:41] this age If any man hear my voice and
[1:27:44] open the door not just hear his voice so
[1:27:46] not just oh that was good preaching that
[1:27:47] was good church service or that was a
[1:27:48] good message I heard open your door open
[1:27:50] your heart to there to that voice he
[1:27:53] will come in and you'll have
[1:27:56] communion amen so so so there's a voice
[1:27:58] in this end time now Jesus would say
[1:28:01] here going
[1:28:03] back he
[1:28:05] says I Know Thy works are neither hot
[1:28:08] nor cold this is the complaint against
[1:28:09] this age I would that thou were hot cold
[1:28:12] or hot so then because thou are lukewarm
[1:28:14] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[1:28:16] thee out of my mouth now it says nowhere
[1:28:18] in the Bible I'm just paraphrasing
[1:28:20] quickly from the church ages but the
[1:28:22] Bible does not say anywhere where in the
[1:28:24] mouth of God we're engraved in his hands
[1:28:27] we're in his bosom we're in his mind so
[1:28:29] what's in his mouth his word so what
[1:28:32] happens now is is is people have
[1:28:35] replaced the word of God with Creeds and
[1:28:37] dogmas and they're speaking Creeds and
[1:28:39] dogmas they're not speaking the word of
[1:28:41] God because if you speak the word of God
[1:28:43] then God will confirm that word right so
[1:28:46] now Eagles speak the word of God they
[1:28:49] don't speak tradition they don't speak
[1:28:52] man's ideas they speak the word of God
[1:28:55] Amen so now this voice
[1:28:59] now the voice of God now comes into a
[1:29:02] people right maybe I'm just you're
[1:29:05] listening okay so the voice of God comes
[1:29:07] into a people and it's not a voice
[1:29:09] that's contrary to the Scripture it is a
[1:29:12] scriptural voice it ties in like brother
[1:29:14] Braham was asked he said uh you you
[1:29:16] someone said to him tempting him saying
[1:29:18] brother Bram with all your experiences
[1:29:19] and Revelations you could write a new
[1:29:21] Bible like the seven Thunders all these
[1:29:23] things it would you know require a new
[1:29:24] Bible he says no it's already in the
[1:29:26] scripture you can't add or take away
[1:29:28] from it it all has to be in the
[1:29:30] scripture like the revelation of the
[1:29:31] seven SS it's all in the scripture it's
[1:29:33] all there we don't have another book we
[1:29:35] have a book The Bible amen all the
[1:29:39] Revelation comes from the BC someone was
[1:29:41] tempting him saying no because if he did
[1:29:43] that he'd be speaking for himself and
[1:29:45] not be speaking for God so now he's
[1:29:47] saying I'll spew the out of my mouth in
[1:29:48] other words you'll no longer speak for
[1:29:50] me right so we don't want to be speaking
[1:29:53] for a church cuz we know a church cannot
[1:29:55] save anyone it's the word of God that
[1:29:58] saves people it's Jesus Christ the man
[1:30:00] the word that saves not the woman the
[1:30:02] church right so now this Eagle anointing
[1:30:05] brings the voice of God into you see the
[1:30:08] voice of God's got to come off books and
[1:30:09] tapes even off the pages of this word
[1:30:11] it's got to live in you right God God
[1:30:14] when the Rapture comes he's not going to
[1:30:16] Rapture this Bible this will stay here
[1:30:19] right the message books and tapes are
[1:30:20] going to stay here but what is he going
[1:30:22] to do he's going to take living Epistles
[1:30:24] he's going take men and women that that
[1:30:26] word God God has transferred that word
[1:30:28] into them that now the living Christ
[1:30:30] lives in a people hallelujah so now that
[1:30:33] voice now is in
[1:30:35] flesh amen that is the same voice that
[1:30:39] is the same voice that's called Lazarus
[1:30:42] from the grave CU remember Jesus said
[1:30:44] Jesus said I'll be with you even in you
[1:30:46] to the end of the world right so the
[1:30:48] Holy Ghost we understand is God right so
[1:30:51] the same God that was in Jesus Christ
[1:30:54] being being the God man now came down
[1:30:56] and dwells in the church right in the
[1:30:59] Old Testament is a pillar of fire he
[1:31:01] came and lived in Jesus Christ who was
[1:31:03] who was Emanuel God With Us paid for our
[1:31:05] sins and then what happened on the day
[1:31:06] of Pentecost that same Pillar of Fire
[1:31:08] came into the upper room filled the
[1:31:11] church right it's the same God but now
[1:31:14] living in people are we are we all
[1:31:16] together so I can so so the Holy Ghost
[1:31:18] you receive is exactly the same Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost as was in Jesus Christ as was in
[1:31:23] the apostles as it's not a weaker Holy
[1:31:24] Ghost it's not a different Holy Ghost
[1:31:26] it's the same one amen so now creative
[1:31:30] power that spoke and brought a man who
[1:31:32] is already decomposing rotting in the
[1:31:34] grave amen brought him back to life in a
[1:31:36] healthy sound well body that same voice
[1:31:39] of the Resurrection lives in you amen
[1:31:42] this is very important because remember
[1:31:43] this Eagle anointing doesn't just cause
[1:31:45] us to see but it has a voice amen and
[1:31:47] that voice is where's that voice it's in
[1:31:49] you amen if you if God truly dwells in
[1:31:52] you that same voice is in you am mean
[1:31:54] that's why it's so important you've got
[1:31:55] to speak to your Mountain not with your
[1:31:58] human understanding you got to let God
[1:32:00] get a hold of your life and God take
[1:32:02] these lips and God speak his word forth
[1:32:04] that you realize it's not you speaking
[1:32:06] it's him speaking through you
[1:32:09] hallelujah amen so the same voice that
[1:32:12] said Lazarus come forth now comes and
[1:32:14] dwells in you that's why it's so
[1:32:16] important amen when there's someone dead
[1:32:18] in trespasses and sins maybe maybe their
[1:32:21] life seems to be rotten four days in the
[1:32:22] grave past Redemption
[1:32:24] God don't say that amen no one's gone
[1:32:28] too far someone should have said Amen to
[1:32:30] that can't we look beyond the human
[1:32:33] senses that person's Gone Too Deep too
[1:32:36] long too far who
[1:32:37] said who says that the devil says that
[1:32:42] amen but now what does that eagle
[1:32:44] anointing
[1:32:45] say all that the father has given me
[1:32:48] will come and all that come me on no
[1:32:50] wise cast out amen that's why it's so
[1:32:52] important when you pray pray with
[1:32:54] purpose amen pray with anointing amen
[1:32:57] pray with a burden amen don't be passive
[1:32:59] in your prayers amen you remember the
[1:33:01] voice of God from the throne told told
[1:33:03] the devil when when the devil was trying
[1:33:05] to touch job the voice of God said this
[1:33:08] is your restrictions devil and the devil
[1:33:10] had to obey the voice of God that same
[1:33:14] voice is in you that's right amen so God
[1:33:17] wants to use your voice to set
[1:33:20] restrictions on the enemy I mean what is
[1:33:22] the principle work of the Church casting
[1:33:24] out of
[1:33:26] Satan
[1:33:28] amen go into all the world preach the
[1:33:30] gospel cast out Devils you'll speak in
[1:33:32] new tongues lay hands on the sick they
[1:33:34] you all those things right but it's to
[1:33:36] cast out Devils that the spirit of God
[1:33:38] can come and dwell in
[1:33:39] someone that voice is in you friends
[1:33:42] don't put it off on the prophet or
[1:33:43] someone else no the voice of the
[1:33:45] Resurrection is in You by the spirit of
[1:33:47] God that's in
[1:33:50] you
[1:33:52] amen hallelujah see people need more
[1:33:54] than just reasoning I'm just going to
[1:33:55] close with this thought people need more
[1:33:58] than just reasoning and arguments about
[1:34:00] where we should worship see the see the
[1:34:02] woman at the well she saw Jesus was a
[1:34:05] prophet but say you know that you know
[1:34:07] we worship here the Jews say you should
[1:34:08] worship here and all these things this
[1:34:10] church this church whatever more it goes
[1:34:12] beyond that she needed more than that to
[1:34:14] hear that eagle cry she needed more than
[1:34:16] that to come out of that cage of her
[1:34:18] life and and and and fly in the
[1:34:19] heavenlies with Jehovah God she need
[1:34:21] more than reasoning of who's right and
[1:34:23] wrong but she need a messiah to say I am
[1:34:26] he amen and this is what people are
[1:34:28] looking for they want to see Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ real today more than tradition
[1:34:33] more than an argument more than those
[1:34:35] things they want to see Jesus Christ
[1:34:37] real Hallelujah that's why it's so
[1:34:39] important we can look back and say
[1:34:42] God you think about God gave us Eagle
[1:34:44] Vision when we started this church he
[1:34:46] said if you remain humble amen my word
[1:34:49] will continue to go forth and I'll bring
[1:34:51] people here and they'll find rest
[1:34:52] they'll find rest for their Souls right
[1:34:54] when we first died just a handful of us
[1:34:56] God gave us Eagle Vision that that is
[1:34:58] going to happen amen so now when we went
[1:35:01] through troubles and trials and hardship
[1:35:03] whatever more we could look Beyond those
[1:35:05] things were the troubles there yes was
[1:35:08] the hardships there yes were things bad
[1:35:11] sure but we could look Beyond those
[1:35:13] things say God you have ordained that
[1:35:15] people will come to this place and
[1:35:18] they'll find rest for their souls so
[1:35:20] Lord if you've ordained that we can look
[1:35:21] beyond the trouble and say God
[1:35:24] that's what you've said and has he not
[1:35:26] prom has he not fulfilled that promise
[1:35:28] has he finished fulfilling that promise
[1:35:30] he has not finished fulfilling that
[1:35:32] promise hallelujah amen amen God's done
[1:35:36] the
[1:35:39] impossible I'm just going to leave it
[1:35:41] there but I want you to think about this
[1:35:43] God has a voice that voice wants to be
[1:35:46] in you that's not your human
[1:35:48] understanding trying to work things out
[1:35:50] and speak things no you let God do it
