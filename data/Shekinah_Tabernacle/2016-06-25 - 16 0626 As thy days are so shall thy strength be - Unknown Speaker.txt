amen amen thank you musicians hallelujah amen God bless you all it's good to be home amen it's good to Brother Joseph with us sister Mar God bless you amen hallelujah amen what can God do right now hallelujah amen amen if you got your Bibles handy amen thank you brother John appreciate that amen hallelujah amen let's just turn to I want to go to a Song of Solomon Chapter 6 where we're just going to read one verse there and then we're going to go to Deuteronomy chapter 33 it's the Song of Solomon Chapter 6 and verse 13 amen H you love this morning he says now return return oh oh shunamite return return that we may look upon thee what will you see in in the shite shite and the answer is as it were the company of two Aries we got to Deuteronomy chapter 33 now you say that's a pretty obscure kind of piece of scripture well got to Lord willing I'll see what the Lord will do now Deuteronomy 33 and: 25 now we understand that that the scripture this isn't just to Ash of the tribe it's to every believer all generations it says thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy day so shall thy strength be there is none like unto the god of of of jaram which is actually Israel who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his Excellency on the sky the Eternal God Is Thy refuge and underneath are the Everlasting Arms and he shall Thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them amen let's just keep reading uh Israel then shall dwell in safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon the land of corn and wine also his Heaven shall drop down due happy Art Thou o Israel who is like unto thee Oh people saved by the Lord The Shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy Excellency and thine enemies shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shallal tread upon their high places may the Lord bless his word you may be seated Hallelujah now I want to read a couple other parts of scripture if you want to go to Isaiah chap 59 with me you know it's incredible where if you look really what we have look who you are you know I want to I want to take a wait let's just read this and then I'll let's just read this Isaiah 59 very very uh familiar piece of scripture here if we read from um Isaiah 59 and and verse 19 it says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and from the glory of from the rising of the Sun and we know the sun is risen in this day when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion remember the Zion is remember Zion is the bride and unto them um and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayth the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the Lord from hence forth and forever I want to I want to talk about I want to take a I want to take that second part of the verse 25 in Deuteronomy 33 and as thy days shall so shall thy strength be and I want to I want to pose a question now now the reason I read that is because because as your days are so how evil the enemy is how evil the your your opponent is so shall your strength be to overcome that enemy amen hallelujah and now we read that scripture and and I'm just trying to gather this all together but we read that scripture in the Song of Solomon because there was a a question went forth because this this this this shunamite here the shulamite forget about I pronounce it properly that is actually speaking of you speaking of of of the bride of Christ and and we see the question now is the question now what will you see you know what will you see in in the shunamite and the answer is as it were the company of two armies and now this company of two armies is is very important because the question is posed what do you see in yourself you know it's all very well to look at maybe brother brandom and say what a mighty you know God live through his life in an incredible way and you may look at a brother or sister in church and say and and admire how how God lives in their life in an incredible way but what do you see when you see yourself I mean what do you see when you look down in yourself because we must understand that is not just us this is not just a religion this is just not just a club this is not just a natural Gathering of man but there is a supernatural power behind the bride of Christ amen that all power is behind the believer we must understand this all power of Heaven is is is backing you up if you stand for God in his word God will sure stand for you and so now the question is what do you see when you look at yourself because this company of two armies this word armies here in my Bible there's a CR CR reference to to uh Mahan in in Genesis chapter 32 and verse two we have Jacob and and and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place Maham so he he recognized that that it was a place of of of two camps or two armies because there was there was an Angelic host that came to meet him so there was a realm was open to him that he had no there about there were Angels there and not just was there a host of angels there was there was his people there so it was a place where Heaven and Earth United together and this is the same word of this of this company of two armies so the bride now what do you see when you see yourself do you see a natural person do you see a natural believer do you see a natural family or do you see that unseen one hallelujah amen do you see that unseen one that's with you what do you see I just want to throw that question out because what you see is what you'll lean upon if you see God you'll lean upon God you'll draw your strength from him but if you just see a natural understanding and reasoning and this is what I think I should do in life and I've got to work things out you'll lean that way our our strength comes from the Lord amen amen our strength does not come from our top two inches in this little Noggin amen our strength and and our and our leadership and our understanding comes from him amen hallelujah amen we are and this this place of of Mahan name is very significant I know I've talked about these things before but just very briefly we know King David when he was on the run from Absalon he went to Mahan and then he went there and then after that he sent out his army and his army defeated Epsilon he was and it's significant where they go in the you in the scripture it's significant the places they go to and so he was going to a place where Heaven and Earth were present together he went to a place to draw strength for the battle ahead he was a fugitive from the throne everything looked like it was lost but he didn't depend upon himself amen he depended upon God and he went to a place Hallelujah where there was a company of two armies there the visible and the invisible in time of trouble you say well that's neat that's a nice story that's not a story friends right David's living out you amen that's right amen if he went to a place where he could draw Supernatural strength you ought to go to that same kind of place amen amen remember he is the strength of our life amen hallelujah Glory I don't know what's going on don't draw natural understanding natural uh this is how things should be you draw you draw strength from him amen amen now so but I want to pose this question to you now we understand as I said the shunamite is the bride and the question really poses what do you see in you see the devil I just I just throw this out here the devil all he wants to do is cut that Lifeline he wants to take you away from the supernatural presence of God that's right that's what he wants to do not just at church if he can he'll keep us all away from this place because there's a spirit of Deliverance in this place there's God's anointing in this place we're Washed by the Water of the word the devil tries to clamp things upon us then the word comes forth and it washes us so he wants to keep us away from hearing the word of God the anointed word of God he wants to keep us from our prayer life amen he wants to keep us from drawing strength from the word of the hour right because we don't us we're not drawing physical things you got understand if you really know him you have a spring of living water coming out of you amen and and and that is a spirit of God coming out of you you got to tap into that yes am don't let a log Jam get in there of circumstance or resentment or or or or unforgiveness don't let those things get caught in there draw from what's in you amen I trust you have that in you amen there's more I I probably said it a few times there's more there's more in this building than what you see with the natural eye all of God is here Heaven Is Here angels have come to work what you worship God they don't know what it's like to be redeemed we know and there's come a time and and and and now is where where where they have to watch and they can't sing the songs we sing cuz they don't understand Redemption amen remember angels are sent to minister unto the ear of Salvation there's angels in this room God's in this room amen we're two or three gathered in my name there I am in the midst that's not just nice that's not just nice language it's a reality am hallelujah amen now I want to go into what's been happening this week I want you to understand what's been happening now amen we read well it says we yeah we read there in Isaiah well sorry this is in Isaiah chapter 10 remember well we read in 59 when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard that's what he said he said he will and he has he has hallelujah amen and then Isaiah 10:27 and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off his shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen this is what God's promised because of his anointing the Yoke will be broken the Yoke will be destroyed amen hallelujah hallelujah and this is what we have seen I just want to you know maybe have a bit of Liberty but you know you know sister Vanessa put on the WhatsApp she was she was afraid but hesitant to go to go witnessing now a yoke inhibits real movement cuz because it's a burden you got to pack and if you're packing a burden you can't run like you want to run so it's a yoke Y and then what we have is is you know but as long as there's a desire in the heart you understand if there's a desire God will come and break whatever's holding that desire back and then so we prayed and then God came down amen took that fear away Hallelujah and then God Came Upon the scene and then the testimony came forth and that's exactly what has happened you read in the book of Acts and it says that they threatened the disciples you shall not preach in his name anymore they threatened them what were they trying to do put fear upon the Believers trying to intimidate them trying to yoke them that they couldn't live how they want to live and then they prayed and then it says now and it says and when they prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they're all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness so the anointing came down and broke that yok and if it's good back then it's good today Hallelujah to prove it's the same God do you understand what's going on in this place friends not just here but all over the world there's a book of Acts being written behind the bride of Christ Hallelujah he says he says in Christ is a mystery of God revealed but if that original vine ever puts out another Chute yes amen it'll bear grapes like it did the first time and if the life of Jesus Christ ever puts out another body of Believers hallelujah amen it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of book of Acts behind it called it's the same life see what I mean you just can't get away from it it's the Life of Christ in you being injected In You by the Holy Spirit itself living its life through you and that's exactly what we've seen am and if you and you say I don't really understand what's going on just open yourself and say Lord come and live in me Hallelujah cuz that's exactly what happened this week God came and broke the Yoke Hallelujah and then sister Nomi receives the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah and I was talking to my wife on Saturday I said that's the indication that this is real because it births people into the kingdom it doesn't make them religious it changes their nature it changes their life and it lives out of them that's a Vindication that this message is the truth of the word because it produces the life that's in this word hallelujah you know people can try and argue it away I say just come look at some life come look at what it does to people and it doesn't make them love the prophet it makes them love Jesus Christ the word hallelujah yes sir that's exactly what it does so we must understand that there's more for us than against us I want to encourage you friends don't look at what you may be going through you got to recognize there's more than you in this battle me there's more than you in this walk and it's worth every inch of the way hallelujah hallelujah it's worth every struggle it's worth every disappointment it's worth every burden and everything you've got to carry it's worth every battle against the enemy every inch of the way it's worth itj Hallelujah just keep pressing friends don't feel you know oh I get so discouraged of myself just just just conf confess it to the Lord and walk on amen amen walk on with God he wants you to walk on with him amen hallelujah amen another book of Acts is being written yes sir now we have I'm just going to throw some statements out we have the mechanics and the Dynamics amen so you know you know brother baham says he says it's in the rising of the sun he uses the analogy of having two cars and they can be exactly the same and they can have all the finest you know engine and everything everything can be finally tuned but then if one doesn't have the spark plug I me because it's like he says well you pour gasoline in the tank how do you know it's gasoline because when you turn on the car it runs down the road to prove it's gasoline yeah he says he says you can have two cars perfectly the same but if one doesn't have the spark plug to fire the engine to prove that it's gasoline amen then that that car is useless that's right all the mechanics can be there but if there's not that thing that ignites the fuel that gets the engine turning over and going that's a waste of time that's right amen so we have we have the mechanics and the mechanics is the pure word of God Amen we have the perfect interpretation of the scripture amen we not looking for it we have it amen because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mysteries of God should be finished and they are we're not wondering who we are we're not wondering who he is we're not wondering where we're going or where we are in time we knowen amen we know what he likes and what he doesn't like we're not guessing amen it's the Revelation now the Revelation contained in the message that is what is perfect it's not every single word it's the Revelation contained because he you know repeats himself the the and and all these things but if you take the revelation of it is this okay the revelation of it is perfect amen amen how do I know which is God and which is him just take it all from the Lord just take it all from the Lord yep that's right so the Revelation contained in the message that is perfect and that Revelation reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture not another Gospel of Jesus Christ but Christ in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation amen it's not another gospel we don't need a whole bunch of manuals to say well this is this it it is what it is yeah the message reveals Christ Here Am amen and this is proven we say well how do you know this because we're not here just to argue well this man says this this person says this this Bible School says this it goes beyond that it is proven because the Lord supernaturally backed up the prophet messenger and I'll say by scriptural Vindication now well what does scriptural Vindication mean it means that the Supernatural part of the ministry was shown in scripture to promised for the end time in which we're living in yeah that's why the prophet over and over repeated Luke 17 in the days of Noah as it was the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is revealed he repeated it over and over again and then he would go back to Genesis 18 and when the Lord came down and and and appeared to Abraham and Sarah and Sarah was in the tent behind them and he says where is thy wife and you know Abraham says she's in the tent behind you and he says according to time of life I'm going to visit you you can have the promised son you know and then and then of course the Lord knew what she was thinking in her heart he repeats this over and over again and quite a few times now now there's a reason he's saying these things as is and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy in 59 he says let you know it's the same Angel I'll turn my back and he says right right straight behind me is a man he's praying for mother and father heart trouble and arthritis they come from our Kansas their name is Smith you believe with all your heart back there Mr and Mrs Smith go home and receive your healing and be made well in the name of Jesus Christ amen if you believe it with all your heart then go and receive it now just just keep praying somebody in this section there's a woman sitting in this Direction She's Got trouble with her back with her hip uh Mrs Kirby believe with all your heart do you then you go home and be well Mrs Kirby Jesus Christ makes you well do you believe the same angel of God SE of Abraham what's the matter there's a woman right out from that woman here looking at me she's praying for somebody it's her son he's an a mental hospital and she's praying for him that's right lady you believe Jesus Christ will make him well if you do raise your hand all right may it be so as you have believed have faith in God what do you think honey that little girl mommy in her arms around you there you believe you believe Jesus will heal you from that sugar diabetes and let you get well you do if you do stand up on your feet all right go home and be well in the name of Jesus Christ amen and there's countless times he says now now I'll turn my back so he relates Genesis 18 He says now I'm going to turn my back to show he was clowning he was proving the same God that was there was standing there where he was amen and then he also would go to Jesus and the woman at the well because the same God was in Genesis 18 became flesh in Jesus Christ and he did exactly the same things amen he says as it was the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is revealed so it's scripturally Vindicated you understand this goes beyond well these people have healings these people have healings but this is scripturally Vindicated a unique Ministry am mean to prove that it was God God was standing there backing up what he said amen hallelujah and he says a few times now if I be a servant of God and if I have said the truth now let him come forth and prove that it's true amen you got to think about this now this goes beyond argument reasoning and these people say this this person well what what was God backing up right amen amen because whatever God's backing up I want say Lord I want to walk with that amen hallelujah amen he was not clowning amen and this was to prove that what was being said was the mechanics the truth of the word but we understand that the scripture says that we must worship Him in spirit and in truth now I just want to throw this in here he says this this is in um this is in reason reasoning versus what's happened this is in wisdom versus Faith but everyone agrees we have to Worship in spirit and in truth yeah now he says this and Jesus said your name is in the palm of my hand remember what do you see when you look at yourself so how how is it going to be forgotten can't be all right now if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith of knowing who he was yeah amen amen now remember it's who you are you got to know who you are not what you think your performance should be but who you are remember the apostles they said to whom shall we go they'll have the words of eternal life there was something drawing them to his words to him amen so it wasn't their performance that they were resting upon it was more they should have been resting ing upon God had called them something had anchored in their souls this is the word of eternal life you understand don't look at your performance amen look at what you are amen amen Lilia I mean Gabriela can barely run that doesn't mean she's not my child you understand she's my child because of blood because of life that's why she's my child amen so as long as there's life there hallelujah amen as long as there's life there right and if there is that means that you're a son of daughter of God you hear me now you're a son or daughter of God by birth amen and that's all that matters if you fall just say Lord forgive me try me one more time Hallelujah that's all you need to do and walk on amen amen this has been burning in my bosom friends you got to recognize what we have who you are don't just count to the devil say oh I'm just a useless unworthy thing God's made you worthy we're more than conquerors amen we have this message I'll come to it at the end again we have the only thing upon this Earth that can actually cause people to live overcoming lives am mean we have the power of the Cross we don't just talk about Calvary we see Calvary am we see what he was doing has achieved in US amen hallelujah we see the power of the blood yes amen no other church has that that's why they compromise with s and they just let the church go every way you can do whatever you want basically it's all Grace Grace enables you to live the word amen Grace forgives you absolutely and then if and if Grace has truly come upon you then your life will be different because you recognize you've been forgiven Allelujah now knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature then he asked are you ready what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestinated yes the predestinated bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church church is in it right now Hallelujah in it now everything's in order the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been sown the evening lights have been shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus promised us here and Malachi 4 predestinated church he says oh devil Church of the Living God here and on tape that so that includes us do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of God that the Holy Spirit Reigns in your heart and every word word is real to you congregation says amen I trust hallelujah oh brother how is Satan going to stand against that hallelujah how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following it why you could throw them in jail why if if you could I don't care what you do they done tried it they R it in the jails they were fed to Lions they were s aund they were jerk to pieces you can't kill it right a church that's predestinated those who he fornew like he did in Jesus he had called those who he called he is Justified those he had Justified he has already glorified predestinated and now in the last days with every seed sowed everything in order the world in its order the time shaped up the church in its order the seed the evening lights the signs like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down moving performing the signs that did then Malachi 4 promised he would send in the last days what he promised and we see all that right here amen he says where where he says amen amen amen do you love him amen hallelujah sure right here in the last days a predestinated church I'm sure you can say he's talking about me he's talking about you a predestinated church knowing where they're standing swed with the seed the holy spirit in the church he says Satan be careful what happened just a minute now what happened with everything just promised to it even the promises of Malachi 4 what did Satan do when he met Jesus he flew into him with all the ecclesiastical Force he had I know the word also flew into him that denominational dust that he had they throw it right onto him but it didn't have any life uh did he ever fly off he came off a lot quicker than he flew on Amen Satan did why he hit that 100 billion volt wire there he singed his feathers he come off amen he he come off of them he come out of him because that wire had vault in it remember Satan has a had a wire too but no matter how nice the CPP of the wire is it if if it hasn't got no life in it is is dead she won't act the same wire one's got energized with the Dynamo the other has no connection at all that's right that's the connection it'll work in a predes ated vessel that's the reason the the word will work where it's connected Glory connected where with the denomination no sir that's a dead socket having a form of godliness denying the power but connected with the word which shall never pass away and can produce the same power at every time oh where is it at he says Oh Glory Hallelujah he says Jesus was predestinated we talk about this during the week it's easy to see in someone else's life and it's easy to look at someone else's life and say well they had to go through this and face this and do this and it molded them like this and here they are like this you take brother braham's life it's easy to see well he had to turn down the invitation the first time you know when he got in you know he got invited you know to go preaching but but pressure of the family he stayed at home and he lost his wife and his baby and all these terrible things happened and then and then he how he how he buckled to the pressure in South Africa and he didn't listen to what God Said but he listen to the min ministers and all these things we see why he had to go through these things cuz God was molding a character into him that when the sword came down when the open word came into his hand he had the character to now give it out to the people it's easy to see it in his life but when you look back at your life and we wrestle why did this happen and why did this have to happen and why did I have to go through this it's the same purpose that's right amen none of God's work is in vain I don't really see God in those things one day you'll understand that's right amen amen but God was God was allowing things to happen cuz God was molding a character for a purpose am we just have to have peace in that just just just just L at his feet and walk on Lord I don't understand why that happened to me but here it is I'm just going to walk on you allowed it to happen ultimately amen so we need now we need the spirit of God you can't just remember this message is not just mentally agreeing to a doctrine that is not how you become a believer you become a Believer by the spirit of the word coming into you you become a Believer by a real birth am not a mental Ascent well now I agree he's a prophet it's not that sure you have to agree but you don't just stay there you've got to meet the person of the word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and if he was a real being back then he sure is the same today if he was the same God that met Paul is present today amen and you got to meet him you got to meet him if you don't meet him you've missed the whole thing it's really that simple now he says and believest thou this I'm still on my subject if you say where are you going I'm still on my subject now the Holy Ghost is good for you it'll straighten you out that's what the matter with down in these countries now and all over the world we got too many cold formal churches having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof what we need today is get a little starch out of the church and that goes to Pentecost cost to and I'll say that goes to the message realm as well amen you know it cuz you're afraid amen don't be afraid you say well I'm not afraid but actually if you're not willing to let go and let God then you are afraid yes amen if you're not willing to let go and let God have his way you're scared that is afraid Don't Be Afraid amen fear is a is is is a great paralysis that tries to people up don't be scared step out in faith it belongs to you amen that's right amen well you say you know cuz people they want to they want to keep uh you know we're we're refined you know they want to keep their themselves you know they want to be dignified all the time dignified is dead that's right amen you got to have life about you brother bar Master a question how yeah he says and how can I overcome you got to keep life about you that's how you overcome yep so people are afraid to let go now the scripture says in Psalms 126:5 they that se and tears shall reap in Joy amen and then verse six he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him so there's got to be a time you know it's not say a sinner's prayer and move on you got to have a broken time God there has to be a death before life comes forth it doesn't matter what god well God did that for me years ago but now you're in amongst the truth now you've got to be born again to this present truth yes sir oh but I I'm afraid what people will think of me if they have anything of God about them they'll rejoice and they'll pray for you and they'll be happy about itah amen you don't become that's why I say you have to be willing if you don't want to lose control of yourself then God can't work it's really that simple if you're not willing to lose control you say well I'm not I'm not that kind of person you see people they sit in church and they just they're as rigid as a piece of stone but get them out in other environments maybe to the rugby or some kind of SP thing and they're shouting and they lose their voice and they're enthused and and they even sometimes got tears coming down their cheeks what to try oh I can't believe he did that wasn't that amazing but I'm not that kind of person I don't know friend you got to come under the right atmosphere you got to come under the right anointing amen amen now brother R says in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ in 65 remember you got to be willing just to let go of yourself amen there has to be a real time oh am I looking for emotion emotion will come amen but but if you try and hold back if people try and hold themselves together there can't be a breaking out and there can't be a real birth it's like a chicken if the chicken can't or I was use your Eagle if the eagle doesn't break through the shell then that e Eagle will die in that egg amen oh but it's so refined and look how nice it is it's just here but then when that eagle breaks out flaps its rings about amen it looks like a real mess yes amen but an eagle's born and it can do things that never knew about in the shell and it's the same thing amongst the Believers amen amen hallelujah amen just help me for a second now and if a woman now this is an invisible Union and if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's not to Mother something it's their nature uh but to Bear a child for a husband raise it to the service of God that's entirely all out of her line now remember he's talking about natural natural woman typing the church now that's why he's making these comments okay now she'd be so disgraced if she did by her sin loving Society of this 1965 type of woman or 2016 type of woman a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her no she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches why they throw her out right quick why do you let such stuff as this go on so so we see she's pregnated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but you don't want any of them screaming hollering blabbering p acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belongs to that throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she don't want uh so she don't want to be pregnated with the word cuz that's the only kind that the word can bring forth that is the only kind the word can bring forth he say but I'm scared to let go you have to be willing to let go how can you how can you really pray to God if you want to in your mind pray real prayer is when you let go and he prays through you that's real prayer but in your mind working out something and saying something in your mind that's just you talking to the ceiling amen so if that is on that case you have to be willing to let go oh but I don't want people to think less of me as I said before if there's any part of God in them they will rejoice they won't think anything bad of you though they'll say praise God that person's broken through they've touched heaven and Heaven's dealing with them amen and because that's what we want and that's what we need amen because if we stay all stiff and starchy and you know oh the music's nice but you're all stiff and starchy and just keep walking along you're leaning on the natural man that's right you're never going to overcome the strength for your day is in the Holy Ghost amen amen you're the strength for your day is in the word amen amen how are things broken in pray pray we have a prayer meeting that's why that's why Lord willing in a fortn night's time we'll be at the church of P base we can all come together we need times oh that's just a camp it happens virtually every Wednesday amen amen that's right amen where God comes down and whatever measure he wants to come down and people have changed amen that's right amen it's just what happen and and we need those times it's not just sitting and listening to sermons and having great worship we need that too amen but you need that personal time with God yes sir why do we feel better after a Wednesday because whatever the devil's trying to be putting down our throat God comes down and breaks those things and we get up again why do we feel better after being in church cuz whatever the devil's been trying to put down your throat God comes and braks we keep walking on but if you don't enter into those times then the devil just keeps pushing pushing pushing down this is a supernatural gospel amen this is a supernatural walk oh but people will think less of me the devil will think less that's the devil lying to you he he tries to rob you of a blessing he's not afraid to come in among you yes you remember the first camp we have sister Shantel there the Lord was right there the devil was working right there but then the devil was defeated Hallelujah and if he's defeated once he'll be defeated again amen but the devil's Brazen he's not oh he's God I better run away he's right there and he wants to rob you you see it in the in the prayer lines in the discernment brother Bram God is God is speaking directly someone through the prophet he says oh God th it and then and then God gives an extra Grace and he calls out their name but they missing it all before that why the devil was trying to rob them of what God wanted to do oh but that was back then that's exactly the same why do we have the Mind battles why do we have all the things coming because the devil's trying to cut you off from your source of strength cuz if you start on that treadmill and going down that way then you're just on his hamster wheel and he's got you running and then you get stressed and wor and anxiety comes and oh oh Lord help me what's going on get off the wheel amen get off the wheel you can stop it you know a hamster can actually stop the wheel and he can get off hello hamsters h we amen you got to think about it oh but there's all this going on my Help Cometh From The Lord amen who are you looking to right oh God do not look whatever you do do not trust this thing amen cuz the devil will give you what did he do to Eve it's reasonable you won't die do this you it'll it'll help you in your life well it no brought death and he comes to you just do this you don't have to be like those you see these people crying and shouting in church they're just off that you don't have to be like them but this is what the devil say you don't have to be you got to remember your family will think less of you and what will your relation think overseas and what about your colleagues when they oh no you can't just tell them to shut up amen amen there's a lie from the pit amen what will your husband what will your spouse think of you if they have anything got to them they'll be happy and they'll say glory glory amen boo devil that's right hallelujah hallelujah so don't don't go on this hamster wheel oh all this and all these things and this is what I have to don't worry about it commit it to the Lord amen amen if anything it should drive you to your knees in prayer amen amen amen now as I said here that's the only he says here that's the only kind that the word can bring forth screaming shouting crying acts 238 youngans amen oh I might speak in tongues so I'm afraid Don't Be Afraid however God leads you to go just worship him how he lead you don't hold back don't hold back you know because you must understand brother Abraham says now if I can find it he says he says that if I can oh yes he says this in perfect strength and perfect weakness he says this here now now he's speaking of the believer in God okay he says there that's it we smother him out we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves I've often said the greatest enemy our God is William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one who gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shall God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandom knows nothing about you think well that's an incredible statement from a prophet that had thousands and thousands of visitations of God and and visions and all the supernatural he says if I can get myself out of the way then God can do things that I mean that that he knows nothing about and so if I'm standing here if I can get myself out of the way then can do things and say things that I know nothing about amen well that's just Ministry or or maybe music no you've got a role you've got a part to play to to create an atmosphere to pull down heaven with your faith Amen to create an atmosphere of Heaven around you that's that's your role amen and if you can get yourself out of the way and worship then God can come and do things that you know nothing about Hallelujah is that right amen so we don't want to hinder God Don't Be Afraid amen don't Don't Be Afraid of Anything amen amen Don't Be Afraid now another thing that that that that hinders the Lord is unforgiveness I know I've probably talked about these things before but the only way you can truly forgive someone is if you're willing to let go of the right to ever hold it against them ever again that is the only way you can forgive if you still want to hold it against them you haven't forgiven them there may be tears there may be words but but if there's still something in in you saying no I want to hold this I'm going to subconsciously hold this against this person you haven't forgiven them you have to will to let it go right you have to surrender that right to hold it against them amen amen so if you have not done that then that will hinder your walk with God why do people why are there broken homes and there's you know people go from one person to the other person to the other person why cuz something happens in the first relationship and there's resentment and unforgiveness in this baggage and he says no I'm better than this I can go somewhere else and then the same thing happens there cuz they haven't forgiven this person and they go to the next person next person next person more baggage but they haven't forgiven the original person and there unfor it's all and it's all you got to go back to the source of it why because this person wasn't willing to let go of the right to hold it against them ever again amen amen you can now you can never change the past but you can Sur change how the past affect your future okay now this isn't how can I overcome see all these things will hinder you what does hinder don't let anything hinder you remember we're a place in the bride there's a natural people but there's a supernatural camp that we are dwelling in all the time if you really know him yeah so don't let your past you can only change how the past affects your future future and the only way you canot let your past affect you is to forgive whatever happened and let go of the right of holding it against whoever it doesn't me you may be the biggest victim whatever I'm not trying to belittle what people have been through but you have to let go of the right of holding it against whoever yeah because you may never see that person again in all your days but if you do not forgive them then they will still affect you oh I've moved on but if you haven't forgiven them you haven't moved on well well how do I forgive them just from your heart just let go say Lord I forgive them and you just let it go am I don't want to be able to hold this against them anymore Lord that's right he says and how can I overcome I'm glad he answers that question he says the thing you have to overcome is yourself your ideas your things and surrender yourself to him he overcame for you he knows the way we don't but in Noah's time there were eight Overcomers and that's what we went in they were caught inside now look friends I believe they're taping this and it's on and it's on tape whatever you do who's listening now or who will listen Hereafter the hour is very late and you do have good intentions but be caught inside now don't struggle not him that willth or him that runneth but God just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he's able to perform thank you Lord amen do you believe what God has promised he what has he promised us a body change amen amen what has he promised us to overcome all things to he that overcometh you'll sit with me in my Throne as I sat with my father in his throne that's what he's promised us and you have to have confidence now that he is able to do it what he promised amen amen because if if it's really Anchored In Your Heart God's going to God's going to change these atoms God's going to make me In His Image if it's really anchored in here then you can just rest and walk on Amen not joining one denomination or another denomination and running this that or the other trying this just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep walking on with him that's right that's what I told our brother that just had breakdown okay what what something happened to this guy and it caused him to have a breakdown yeah but this is the advice he gave him just yield to him he's here he who knowed what you have done and what caused your being and doing this way and all that he knows all about you and now he just told you and now he just told you back just what to do now I said only thing you have to to do is just do it that is forget all about the past yeah this is this is a good advice just forget all about the Past walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God that's all you have to do forget about the past you say but there's things that I cannot change there's lots of things we cannot change amen but the power it's not just blood DP you're dripping on a cross you understand the power that was in that sacrifice and by Believing by receiving the truth you have access to the full power of the of the blood where God remember the only unforgivable sin in this in this Bible is blaspheming the your know the Holy Ghost which is causing the works of God of Satan when you knowingly see it amen that is not forgiven in this world or the next that's the only unforgivable sin you understand so everything else can be forgiven Hallelujah and if you really blashe the Holy Ghost you wouldn't be sitting right here and even Paul said he blasphemed but it didn't change didn't change God's idea of Paul you understand so that means if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us the scripture tells us I've done some Terrible Things Moses killed a guy we'll see him one day amen David committed adultery and had had the husband killed the the scripture tells us that he should have been killed he and her should have been stoned you read in Deuteronomy amen we'll see him one day Peter tried to cut a guys ear off we'll see him one day he denied the Lord three times we'll sure see him one day Paul consented to the stoning of Steven I'm going to wipe this thing out he said by we'll see him one day hallelujah amen brother Braham wanted to kill Five Guys when he was young you know the story This Gun wouldn't work then they ran off and he fired at the tree and it blasted the five shots out he wanted to kill himself we'll see him one day amen amen people have done horrendous things Rahab was a harlot the woman of the well had multiple marriages all oh that's so bad we'll see them one day the thief on the cross he must have done something pretty bad to to to Merit being crucified we'll see him one dayall amen amen if God can forgive them can he not forgive you and if God can forgive you can you not let go anything that someone has done to you cuz he doesn't hold it he doesn't hold you know he doesn't hold it like this oh this is your past are they good enough are they good enough oh look what you did you know he doesn't hold it against you but you did this to me why did he go to the Cross because of you you caused them to go there you caused them to receive the nails you caused them to be scourged you caused them to do that he could hold that against you amen but he doesn't he just let it go hallelujah amen amen and if he can do it can't you do it amen he said now who's ever been scorched beaten nailed to a cross made fun of uh uh uh a cloak or whatever put around your face and beaten saying now if you're really the Christ chalice who hit you who's had a crown of thorns put on their head who's been rejected by the very ones that you came to help and deliver and save amen and he just he said father you know forgive them they don't know what they do he was the judge of heavens and earth in flesh he could have just leveled the whole place he said I could call for 12 Legions of angels he probably only needed one Angel would have just obliterated the whole whole bunch of them amen he didn't hold it against them think about it oh but oh but this person did this but we want to be like Jesus amen but but I did this and I did this if you confess your sins to him he is faithful and just to what forgive us read it in first John he's not a man that can lie this is either true or it's not true to me it's true so don't let do not let your past affect your future amen you got to let it go just walk on forget about your past put it under the blood walk on amen amen it doesn't matter how much the devil tries to bring it up just say I'm sorry it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness you go find it go dig it up and show me go fish it out remember there's a sign in that sea no fishing and God is enforcing that law and no one can fish there hallelujah amen so if God can for forgive and forget cannot we remember he carried the sin of the world upon his shoulders that wasn't literally he was packing all of your everything you did your first birth to begin with then all the works of your flesh he was carrying it up that hill but the joy set before him was you redeemed amen amen hallelujah he wasn't afraid to let go he let go and let God he says not my will but thy will be done amen amen he willing y now you say what does this got to do with the place of two camps very simple we have access friends access to a supernatural God the creator of heavens and earth that can not only fight your battles for you but he can undo all the pain and all the wounding and all the fear and everything all the whatever the devil's tried to hold you back with he can he can come forth and undo all those things in a moment that's right amen amen we're not here to do this is not a natural we're not a natural group of people you don't have just natural families you got to understand your life is a supernatural revelation of God you're living out something God had in his mind amen you can tap into this God and it's God that's given you access yes amen by a New and Living Way amen through the veil of his flesh we go to the prince of God says in the book of Hebrews Lord amen and where the denominations tried to Veil them up so the people could never live overcoming lives God has rent that veil in and says here's the Mighty God on Veil before us hallelujah hallelujah and now he's standing here present among us hallelujah amen that you can touch the H of his garments he's not he's not up some plac that's right amen I'll be with you and in you to the end of the world hallelujah amen what would it mean if say okay I'll go with you I'll go with you to work amen cuz I'm going with you I'll have breakf forth with you cuz I'm with you yes hallelujah amen and then and then now you going home well I'm going with you so so so I'll be there right with you you understand now I'm going to go to church well I'll be with you when are we going I'll be right there amen now I'm at school I'll be with you amen cuz you're at school I'll be at school you understand that's what he said oh that's just Pie in the Sky no no sir I resent that it is not God is so more present than than your next breath that's right but if you look at just the natural five senses try and work things out you're you're forsaking your own mercies cuz even Jonah said that they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies and here he was in a belly of a whale in the bottom of the ocean he says it's just I'm not he just called it lying vanity Hallelujah well how can that be he's in a belly of a whale remember God said it was a prepared fish and Jesus said it was a whale so God had already pre-made the pre-made the fish there was total blackness in the belly of a whale what a stunk like fish guts and all kinds of things seaweed whatever more and he says this is lying vanities amen no one has ever been in those circumstances I do not think otherwise you great work stories or something but you see no one would have you see no but he just said this is lying vanities what was happening he was he knew it was just more than him he was tapping into what we're called to tap into amen and he just did it by the blood of bulls and goats and the only reason he could because it was a prayer of a man that said Lord if anyone looks towards this Temple and prays you'll hear them from heaven then God came down and filled the temple and Vindicated yes I'll do what you've said Solomon and then she said once more I look to your temple he didn't have some GPS thing got out a smartphone the temples this way he looked by faith but God spun him round Amen in in a belly of a whale Hallelujah that literally happened friends that's right it's not just a allegory of something no no no it lit he was literally in a whales belly and he literally said I'll whoever forsakes you know whoever observes lying vanities they forsake their own mercies amen so whenever the enemy comes against you whatever more it's lying vanities if it's against the word it's lying vanities amen if the enemy tries to come in and break up your marriage you going to say it's lying vanities amen amen and you got to stand against it you don't look at the situation you look at the promise amen amen don't pray the problem pray the promise cuz if you pray the pray the promise remember he's the high priest of our profession you'll follow me he's the high priest of our profession what should I profess this amen amen if your children are away with Lord you you you we just read there in Isaiah the word that I've given you will not depart from your mouth or your seeds or your seed seeds forever Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah and that's just not a just a mental repetition it's because there's a life in that person and the words they speak of the life of God Amen that's right is the word of God glory that's not too farfetched no we are not a natural now everything this day is a very perilous day says in second Timothy in the last days perilous times will come yeah lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers despisers those that are good having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof what is the power the power is the anointing of God not just having the written word but it's the very life of God to come and defeat the enemy amen amen and he says it's perilous time so we live in a perilous day so then the Lord has come to show us now that our source of strength as the as thy days shall be so shall thy strength be yep now what you say so you've got to understand this what do you turn to oh I have to work this out if we just do this and we can do this and we can do this don't turn to that amen if you want to be Earthly good be Heavenly minded amen amen because if you get too Earthly Earthly minded you're not Heavenly good or you no earthly good either yes look what caral man has done to this world oh cuz I'm going to work this out religious people as well I'm just going to work this out look what they've done we're not to patting ourselves after the church world out there we don't depend ourselves after some denominational idea doesn't matter how good it sounds if it's contrary to this we're a separated people to him amen we're a separated people we're a different class of people not because we've made ourselves different but God has made us different amen hallelujah now as I said in the message l the power for anyone who believes to live above sin and to O to to overcome all things yeah you say well what about the Bible multitudes read the same Bible yeah I trust I I'm not trying to say things shocking I want to get you thinking multitudes read the Bible the same Bible that we do but the truth of it is veiled by the Creeds and dogmas and traditions of man yeah REM so you know remember the message reveals Jesus Christ in here that's right amen so when when we when when we read this amen we do not read it through denominational understanding right it's a it becomes a love letter between you and God Amen and you begin to understand what he's saying in here and you can draw strength from these words like no one else can because there's a relationship understand and that's why that's why you know because remember the message reveals Jesus Christ in this word and that is very important because if we understand that then we can see now we have something very different to the rest of the world and we're not trying to be elitist or anything you know brother Bram says Abraham was an ordinary man but then God called him that's what made the difference and there's nothing special about us but God called us amen amen and there's people all around the world God called and that's what makes them special you with me you say well I know a lot of horror stories you know among the ranks of the you know message people that may be so but it doesn't take away the realities of the transforming power that's in the word amen that does not do away with it one second hallelujah amen you know just look if you just think about it look how many people we've seen look how many people we' we' seen transformed just over these last four years amen who's been changed these last four years and then even even my wife said growing up she only saw what Melanie 20 odd years one person four years a whole bunch of people and not just people here we are people changed at Camp why because the power that's God himself backs up the word I mean to prove we don't just have some religion it's God himself doing it Hallelujah and if you can understand that you can say well I can tap through something that the world knows nothing about amen amen just as I said quite a few months ago when Moses brought them out from the Red Sea they went to a you know they journeyed to a place where where there was water but the waters were bitter yeah bitter Waters and many other people would have walked that same track and would have tried to drink the same water so so many other people had the same experiences and they were bitter experiences but there was a tree that was growing by that water but and and all the other saw the tree but God gave the inspiration to Moses cut down that tree and put it in the waters and it made it sweet Hallelujah so we have the same we all have the same experiences as people out in the world and sure they're very bitter things but God cut down a tree Hallelujah a tree of life was cut down on Calvary and can be put into your bter experiences and they're not bter anymore they're sweet Hallelujah that's what God does hallelujah amen our God is present friends that's all you need do Hallelujah just let go and let God hallelujah he can make all things sweet Hallelujah they had to walk down that road hallelujah amen why because Moses was in contact with God hallelujah that's why he said that tree there would have been more trees there but it was that one hallelujah hallelujah that same God is here you understand well I've had a lot of bitter things going on they've changed the whole course of my life let him come amen Cal into that bitterness and it'll become sweet and all you'll say is thank you God you cut down the tree and you put it into my experience and I'm not I'm not better anymore Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord that's all you need to do we have that's why Hallelujah there's a there's two camps in this room right now Hallelujah there's there's us there's God and Satan's being defeated amen there's a battle and array right now between faith and doubt and every mind who do you believe I believe the report of the Lord I've seen him do too much amen I've seen his transforming power too much Hallelujah God's here hallelujah praise his mighty name amen there's a great secret of the scripture brother Ram says it's a keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen Hebrews 38 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah it's a great Keystone of the Bible God doesn't change how he reveals himself may be different as a man or in a burning bush or a pillar of fire or whatever it is that's the same God revealing himself amen so we have the same God is here as was back there with Moses or was with Elijah or it's with Jeremiah or Ezekiel or Daniel or or Peter James and John or Paul I mean with brother Bram is right here with us I mean there's a man standing present at a rapturous church out of here hallah there's a man standing present there's a bomb and Gilead am mean there's healing power in this place Hallelujah if you just Reach Out And Touch the Lord he can do what he wants to do if you're willing to let go he'll do it Hallelujah don't hold on I need to I don't want people I just got to go away and then I'll go pray quietly pray in this atmosphere amen cuz God is in this atmosphere why don't you just
