[27:14] yeah we're going to read our verses one
[27:16] down to
[27:17] verse 6 here
[27:22] this is the so there's everyone there
[27:25] some people are real quick off the
[27:27] trigger
[27:28] some people are still loading the black
[27:29] powder and getting the ball in but hey
[27:31] we're here okay oh yeah also just a
[27:33] reminder there's a lot of weapons in the
[27:34] kitchen the kitchen's turned into an
[27:36] Armory there's a lot of Bibles in there
[27:38] please take your weapons home with you
[27:41] take your sword home don't
[27:43] um
[27:44] don't walk out of these doors unarmed
[27:46] you got to be packing pack the most
[27:48] powerful weapon of the word of God so
[27:50] don't leave them here remember your
[27:52] Bibles for all the week yes okay so
[27:55] it's a kitchen it's not an Armory okay
[27:58] you should have your own Armory at home
[28:00] okay so just yet just a reminder there
[28:02] Psalms 19 and verse 1 the heavens
[28:04] declare the glory of God and the
[28:06] firmament showeth his handiwork day and
[28:09] today utter of speech and night unto
[28:10] night showeth knowledge there is no
[28:12] speech no language where their tongue is
[28:14] not heard their line has gone out
[28:16] through all the Earth and their words to
[28:18] the end of the world in them hath he set
[28:20] a tabernacle for the sun which is as a
[28:23] bridegroom coming out of his chamber and
[28:25] rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
[28:27] he'd goeth forth he his going forth is
[28:31] from the end of the heavens and a
[28:33] circuit unto the ends of it and there is
[28:35] nothing hid from the heat thereof amen
[28:38] this is going to go to Daniel chapter 12
[28:40] I'm going to read
[28:41] uh two verses here verses three and four
[28:45] of Daniel chapter 12. and if you need a
[28:48] Bible let us know we can get you one
[28:49] okay so don't just pick up one from
[28:51] there and use it and then put it back if
[28:53] you need one we can get your Bible okay
[28:55] amen you know about money or price you
[28:58] need a Bible get your Bible
[29:00] all right
[29:01] amen So Daniel 12 and verses 3 and 4.
[29:05] as it speaks of this date
[29:07] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[29:11] brightness of the firmament and they
[29:13] that turn many to righteousness as the
[29:15] Stars forever and ever but thou Daniel
[29:19] shut up the words and seal the book even
[29:20] to the time of the end many shall run to
[29:22] and fro and knowledge shall be increased
[29:25] we live in that day many people travel
[29:27] that's the thought covert's not going to
[29:28] shut down travel because the Bible says
[29:29] men will run to and fro travels back on
[29:32] and knowledge shall be increased it has
[29:33] ever been a day like this day with
[29:35] knowledge increased amen this bowel
[29:37] heads in a word of prayer if you ever
[29:38] need just want to raise your hand before
[29:39] the Lord amen let's pray together
[29:41] gracious father we uh Lord we want to
[29:44] give ourselves away to you Lord Jesus
[29:46] that you can use us Lord that your name
[29:48] would be glorified Lord that your
[29:50] salvation will be made known oh God that
[29:52] you would be glorified in everything we
[29:54] say and do Lord we love you so much we
[29:56] are so thankful we can come into your

[30:12] we want to pray dear God that you'll

[30:16] know the needs behind those hands Lord
[30:18] so I pray you'd meet them Lord for your
[30:19] glory Lord and we love you we thank you
[30:21] for this evening Lord bless all those
[30:23] who couldn't be here Lord I know Lord my
[30:25] darling is driving home from taranaki
[30:27] now I'll keep her safe on the road and
[30:29] anyone else journeying anyone who's
[30:30] unwell and body May heal them Lord and
[30:32] me touch us all like only you can For
[30:34] Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen
[30:37] God bless you friends you can have your
[30:39] seats tonight
[30:40] um I can drive this can't I
[30:42] is I can drive this I can drive this so
[30:45] so William brought me a picture book uh
[30:47] this morning and and and it's not the
[30:50] words that really matter here but what I
[30:51] want to show you from this picture and
[30:53] really got me going is that here here
[30:55] the um here there's this yeah I call
[30:57] daddy bear and uh you know sun bear
[30:59] whatever you know the two beers right as
[31:01] the father and son or mother and
[31:02] daughter whatever right but but but the
[31:04] father's pointing out into the stars and
[31:06] actually telling telling the child we're
[31:09] Written in the Stars before you ever got
[31:12] here you're actually written in the
[31:14] stars now brother Brown tells us that
[31:17] that the first Bible ever written was
[31:18] was written in the stars as uh this is
[31:21] from brother James O'Day plug for his
[31:23] photos he's an amazing photographer but
[31:25] anyway but you know we know that the
[31:26] Bible the first Bible was written in the
[31:28] stars as as Joe would be asked by God
[31:31] when God would actually lay out talk
[31:32] about Orion and Pleiades and different
[31:34] things and because he was actually
[31:36] showing showing job the Bible he was
[31:38] reading
[31:39] but we know that this is not the Bible
[31:41] we read okay we know you know the first
[31:43] Bible was written in the stars the
[31:44] second one was written in the Great
[31:46] Pyramids Enoch wrote the Bible in the
[31:48] pyramids but the third Bible this one is
[31:50] the one we read amen but the message in
[31:52] there is actually the message in here
[31:54] but the Lord's opened this one to us
[31:57] right so the Zodiac and astrology all
[31:59] that stuff is just a perversion of
[32:00] actually the true message in there but
[32:02] the thing is what I wanted to what I
[32:04] what what really spoke to me was that
[32:07] where our lives are written in the word
[32:11] just like our lives are Written in the
[32:13] Stars
[32:14] each each star has to take a certain
[32:16] position
[32:17] and it and it speaks as we read there
[32:20] and um uh we read there in Psalms how
[32:22] utterance speech you know so so the
[32:25] Stars their Arrangement actually
[32:26] preached to the Earth and everyone under
[32:28] Heaven can understand it
[32:30] and so now brother Brown would say in
[32:32] the greatest battle ever fought he says
[32:33] now
[32:34] um um so so he's speaking in the um um
[32:37] speaking about the Stars he says and
[32:39] somewhere in there
[32:41] I had it pointed out to me this is when
[32:42] he was in a big Observatory one time in
[32:44] an observatory the Zodiac beginning with
[32:46] the Virgin coming through the cancer age
[32:48] down until the last was the lion Leo the
[32:50] Lion the first coming of Christ by the
[32:51] Virgin the sin coming by the line of the
[32:53] tribe of Judah and I said I've tried my
[32:56] best to see that zodiac I just can't see
[32:58] it but yet it's there those who are
[33:00] trained I know it's their job saw it men
[33:02] used to look at it it was a Bible and
[33:03] what uh at one day but in that whole
[33:06] great mass of millions and billions of
[33:08] light years God sits in the midst of all
[33:10] of it he looks down Paul is in there my
[33:12] mother's in there somewhere looking down
[33:14] so we're all represented by those stars
[33:16] and I thought of the order of that
[33:18] Heavenly Host not one of them out of
[33:20] place everyone keeps his time perfectly
[33:23] God's Great Army I thought of the
[33:25] soldiers how that if that Moon would
[33:27] happen to get out of order the Earth
[33:29] would recover again with water in just a
[33:30] few minutes the Earth would just be like
[33:32] it was when God decided to use it for um
[33:35] for us to have it here on it was well it
[33:37] was without form and void and darkness
[33:39] and water was upon the breath of the
[33:40] Earth and if that Moon would ever move
[33:43] it would do the same thing again when
[33:45] the when the moon rocks a little bit
[33:46] away from the earth the tide comes up
[33:47] and when it goes down just follows the
[33:49] tides it's God's Great Army and when I
[33:52] thought about God's Great Army there now
[33:54] we went to bed and then I began to think
[33:56] that not one of those is out of their
[33:58] place they're all set in place and if
[34:00] there's a moving anywhere of them it
[34:03] will cause it will affect this Earth we
[34:05] just see the results of it now from some
[34:07] of them moving into their other spots
[34:09] it's effective it affects everything and
[34:12] I thought then if that great Heavenly
[34:13] Host like that has to keep its place and
[34:16] make everything an order what about the
[34:18] disorderly of the Heavenly Host how when
[34:20] one gets out of order how it throws the
[34:22] whole thing out of cater the whole
[34:24] program of God is upset when one member
[34:26] gets out of order we should continually
[34:28] to strive to keep the order of the
[34:31] spirit because because we know the
[34:34] gravitational pull of the stars and the
[34:36] nebulas and the galaxies it all affects
[34:37] one another and but God said it perfect
[34:40] rather they can predict thousands of
[34:42] years in the future win like Haley's
[34:44] Comet will come again and different
[34:45] comments that go out of their solar
[34:47] system come back around they can predict
[34:49] when they come and when they come
[34:50] they're not surprised they're right on
[34:51] time why because it's God's Great Army
[34:54] you know when the changing of the
[34:55] seasons we know the moon
[34:57] um you know it's saying Genesis that the
[34:59] moon was was created to rule the night
[35:01] that the moon would have dominion in the
[35:03] night time and the moon represents the
[35:04] bride of Christ so in this night time
[35:07] that we live in where the Son of God is
[35:09] Not upon the Earth as he was you know
[35:11] you know in the days of his flesh but in
[35:13] this night time where we are just a
[35:14] reflector of that light we're here to
[35:16] rule the night Amen to have dominion
[35:18] over the powers of Darkness every demon
[35:21] power spiritual witchcraft Rebellion
[35:23] whatever it is we have power over all of
[35:26] them but the greatest thing we must
[35:28] realize is that we cannot fight this
[35:30] battle alone
[35:31] we know every Army that's ever been
[35:33] successful is not a group of individuals
[35:35] fighting as individuals you know but uh
[35:38] but uh but but but Warfare is a team
[35:40] sport there's not a bunch of rambos
[35:42] running around with a big sword or a big
[35:43] X or a big machine gun and whatever and
[35:45] no it's not that it's a group fighting
[35:49] as one
[35:50] and we're told that you know the Roman
[35:52] army one of the greatest reasons that
[35:54] they had so much success is because of
[35:56] their leadership structure from the
[35:58] Centurion up to the general or whatever
[35:59] ago they had a specific leadership
[36:01] structure that as the battle would
[36:03] change they could adapt their tactics
[36:04] based on what was going on because they
[36:06] had an effective leadership structure
[36:08] and even their helmets if you look at
[36:09] them there's a gap where the errors so
[36:11] so they could hear the commands and the
[36:13] trumpets perfectly because the their
[36:14] helmets did not obscure their ears and
[36:17] they could adapt in the battle because
[36:18] they were fighting as a as one man not
[36:22] as a bunch of individuals you know it
[36:23] says when the um when they would uh
[36:25] attack the Gauls and you know especially
[36:27] in England different things you know
[36:28] these guys would get off their chariots
[36:30] and just charge in like headlong by
[36:31] themselves they just got cut down
[36:33] because they weren't fighting as a team
[36:35] they're fighting as individuals and so
[36:37] it's so important that we don't fight as
[36:40] individuals we know it's an individual
[36:41] walk we understand that right but the
[36:43] effect we have on one another and
[36:45] against the powers of Satan are combined
[36:48] or more powerful if we walk in harmony
[36:50] we with the word of God it's so vital
[36:52] Abraham says when you leave the word you
[36:54] leave God right so we so if we stand
[36:57] harmony with the word we're walking with
[36:58] God Amen so it's very important that we
[37:01] that we keep this in mind because
[37:03] because we are God's Great Army you may
[37:06] not have realized it but you've signed
[37:07] up you enlisted you weren't drafted or
[37:10] forced you've enlisted willingly to
[37:12] fight for this great cause I meant to
[37:14] fight for the kingdoms of Heaven to tear
[37:16] down every work of the devil every
[37:18] complex pain and fear and anything the
[37:20] devil can put on someone we're called to
[37:21] tears Aiden's Kingdom down and that's
[37:23] not overthrowing governments and all
[37:25] that stuff God will take care of that in
[37:26] the in the tribulation whatever more and
[37:29] you know he'll set up his kingdom upon
[37:30] the Earth in the Millennium but that's
[37:31] his doing but right now we're here to
[37:34] build the kingdom of God in the hearts
[37:36] of men and women boys and girls by the
[37:38] leadership I mean by by the baptism of
[37:41] the Holy Ghost
[37:42] I mean so now the Bible speaks in the
[37:45] Old Testament how they would set their
[37:46] armies in a ray now an array is a is a
[37:50] row it's to be arranged to be put in
[37:52] order so when they would fight battles
[37:54] they would then just run and headlong by
[37:56] themselves they were set in a formation
[37:57] and the and the success of many battles
[38:00] was because of the formation that they
[38:01] would attack in you know many many many
[38:03] armies even outnumbered if they had the
[38:06] right formation they would win the
[38:07] battle like they you know like the um uh
[38:09] French I mean I mean the English against
[38:10] the French in the Hundred Year War
[38:12] there's battles of the battle of Asian
[38:14] core and different battles where there
[38:15] were vastly outnumbered by the French
[38:17] but because of their formation their
[38:18] setup they won the day and we we may be
[38:22] smaller number but we know that you know
[38:24] we are actually the majority
[38:26] but if we can walk remember the Bible
[38:27] says in the Old Testament one will chase
[38:29] a thousand until Chase ten thousand and
[38:32] that's just against a natural you know
[38:33] enemy but but we fight a far greater
[38:36] further than Flesh and Blood we don't
[38:37] fight Flesh and Blood we fight against
[38:39] demon power spiritual wickedness in high
[38:41] places anointings of demon Fallen Angels
[38:43] upon people we fight those things amen
[38:46] so but the thing is if one will chase a
[38:48] thousand two Chase ten thousand how much
[38:50] more how many would we Chase I haven't
[38:52] done the math but you know I believe
[38:54] that that hundred thousand thousand
[38:56] demons loose out of Riverview Euphrates
[38:57] or 100 million however many I think we
[38:59] would whoop them
[39:01] hey man you say yo yo because people say
[39:04] well all of Hell's upon the Earth we're
[39:05] living in Hell's on the Earth all this
[39:07] trouble now but all Heavens here also
[39:09] amen because why because God has poured
[39:12] out Heaven upon the bride of Christ amen
[39:14] that we have a far greater weapon far
[39:16] greater you know God is always greater
[39:18] than the devil I mean but we must walk
[39:21] in unity for the full power of God to be
[39:23] manifested amen because it would say in
[39:25] the Book of Psalms you know how great is
[39:27] the unity among Brethren it's like the
[39:29] anointing all that went down to Aaron's
[39:31] bed all over his garments now you know
[39:33] he had to be anointed to go into the
[39:35] holy of holies to do the to to to to to
[39:37] to manifest or carry out his office of
[39:40] high priest if he wasn't anointed he
[39:42] couldn't carry out his god-given role
[39:44] now how much more you and I right if
[39:47] there's no Unity among us we can't
[39:49] fulfill our office as the bride of
[39:51] Christ right we cannot intercede to the
[39:54] full capacity on behalf of this world on
[39:56] behalf of Fallen people you know we
[39:58] can't preach we can't have meeting you
[39:59] know if there was if there's division in
[40:01] a church how hard would it be for a
[40:03] song-leader to lead songs how hard would
[40:05] it be for a preacher to preach if
[40:06] there's Unity there's a resistance
[40:07] there's a hardness it's like you're
[40:09] fighting the air but then when there's
[40:10] Unity of spirit when there's a hunger to
[40:13] meet God and be in contact with him and
[40:15] it's not fussing and fighting and well I
[40:16] wonder what he's going to say now no
[40:18] none of that but no Lord I want to hear
[40:20] from you Lord I want you to come down
[40:21] lord lord I want you to touch lives Lord
[40:23] I want you to fill us with the Holy
[40:25] Ghost Lord Lord I want to see Miracles
[40:27] Lord I want to see people turn from
[40:28] unbelieving to Faith and God
[40:30] transforming power now if we have that
[40:32] kind of Desire now I believe we have
[40:33] this but you know we're going to look at
[40:35] the what we have
[40:36] and cherish what we have amen and you
[40:39] know not just not just settle with what
[40:41] we have but but desire more Hallelujah
[40:43] you know you're so so if we if we really
[40:45] came with that kind of unity who cares
[40:47] what kind of week you had leave it at
[40:49] the door there's there's this coat
[40:52] hanger Hat Racks hat
[40:55] things there we put coats by the front
[40:57] door
[40:58] take the problems of your week and leave
[41:00] it there and forget to pick it up you
[41:02] know if the if the kitchen turns up into
[41:04] a Dumping Ground of bad weeks that's
[41:05] fine I won't remind anyone of any of
[41:07] them they could and they would throw
[41:09] them out you know there's the wheelie
[41:10] bun see your butt but thing is don't
[41:11] worry about the week you've had you know
[41:13] we should expect a hard time or a
[41:15] stressful time when we come to church
[41:16] because the devil wants us so twisted up
[41:18] in our minds that takes all of the
[41:20] service to be unwanted and the service
[41:22] is done what if we just said praise God
[41:24] the battle's on but we're about to have
[41:26] church and praise God the devil's really
[41:29] twisted me up but we're about to have
[41:30] church God's going to move in a powerful
[41:32] way Hallelujah
[41:34] amen I think I think we can come with
[41:36] that kind of a expectation
[41:40] Hallelujah now
[41:43] to be set in a ray it sounds like a
[41:45] abstract idea but the Apostle Paul tells
[41:48] us how to do it
[41:49] as we're reading Colossians 3 and 18 he
[41:51] speaks about these things in three times
[41:53] you know three different places this is
[41:56] how you stay in Array because you want
[41:57] to be in battle formation eh when the
[41:59] enemy comes in just an ambush and he's
[42:00] just pulverized and you know brother man
[42:03] even says that we can live in such a way
[42:05] that we actually uh avoid him before he
[42:07] comes and hits us
[42:09] you know and and and I think that'd be a
[42:11] good way to live they're not always
[42:13] saying sorry Lord sorry and of course
[42:14] he's faithful and just to forgive us if
[42:16] we confess our sins but what do we
[42:17] better to to bypass it before it gets to
[42:20] us and we just can praise him all the
[42:21] time
[42:22] amen so now in Colossians 3 19 it said
[42:25] now now this is how we're in battle
[42:26] array because because to be in battle
[42:29] array starts at home
[42:31] because remember our our homes are a
[42:33] fortress
[42:34] it's a it's a sanctuary
[42:36] amen it's not a place to fight
[42:39] it's a place to have peace where you
[42:42] step out of Satan's eat and you open the
[42:43] front door you walk into eating
[42:45] conditions
[42:46] Hallelujah
[42:47] praise God Amen so he says wives submit
[42:51] yourselves unto your own husbands as it
[42:53] is fit in the Lord
[42:54] so submit yourselves as they as it's in
[42:57] the Lord if it's not in the lord well
[42:59] stand your ground husbands love your
[43:01] wives and be not bitter against them
[43:03] this is how you stay in battle array
[43:04] don't have time to go into this in a
[43:06] deep way maybe in a future service
[43:07] children obey your parents in all things
[43:09] for its well pleasing unto the Lord
[43:10] fathers provoke not your children to
[43:12] anger least they be discouraged servants
[43:15] obeying all things your Masters
[43:16] according to the flesh not with eye
[43:18] Service as men pleases but in sickness
[43:21] of heart fearing God and whatever you do
[43:24] do it hardly as to the Lord and not unto
[43:26] men knowing that of the Lord you shall
[43:28] receive the reward of the inheritance
[43:30] for ye serve the Lord Christ
[43:33] I think that covers everyone
[43:35] it covers fathers mothers children
[43:37] servants or people who work right and
[43:40] whatever you do do it as unto the Lord
[43:43] because there's a there there's a
[43:45] Synergy between a wife submitting and a
[43:48] husband loving
[43:49] there's a Synergy you know your Synergy
[43:51] feeds off each other
[43:53] right and also children of Bank you know
[43:55] all these scriptures are actually for
[43:57] for not to oppose upon one another but
[43:59] it's for us to take it on heart and say
[44:01] Lord manifest it through me
[44:03] right so I'm a husband so husbands love
[44:06] your wives be not better against them
[44:07] that's you know it's not me to tell
[44:09] Christine Christine you got to submit no
[44:11] no it's her to take that on board and
[44:14] actually say Lord live it through me now
[44:15] she doesn't need to ask help for that
[44:17] she's awesome she's amazing but you see
[44:19] and it's like children obey your parents
[44:20] we shouldn't be pushing down saying you
[44:21] gotta obey and do this and do this no
[44:23] this they should see the script and say
[44:24] Lord I want to I want to I want this to
[44:27] be manifested in me I don't want the
[44:29] spirit of rebellion of the world to come
[44:30] upon me
[44:32] amen and then fathers do not provoke
[44:35] your children to anger so I don't want
[44:36] to treat my girls or even willing that
[44:37] they get angry you know frustrate them
[44:40] all the time and the carrots too far
[44:41] away and trouble them and there's no no
[44:43] no clear boundaries or clear you know
[44:46] things that keep them settled in their
[44:48] Spirits you know because because that
[44:49] leads to discouragement discouragement
[44:52] so so I don't want to do that amen
[44:55] so this is this is what now
[44:58] this is to me this is how we get into
[45:00] battle array because it's not just
[45:01] church it's everyday life
[45:04] I mean because if you think about it if
[45:06] if there's Perfect Harmony
[45:08] all of us with God nothing between our
[45:11] soul and our savior then there's Perfect
[45:13] Harmony between husband and wife and
[45:15] Perfect Harmony between parents and
[45:17] children
[45:18] devil can't get in nowhere
[45:20] he just actually comes into like a it's
[45:23] like you know it's like just well we are
[45:25] lions right praise the lord it's like
[45:28] it's like Daniel's accusers being thrown
[45:30] to the Lions then they just got chewed
[45:32] up you know the devil tries to walk into
[45:34] a home where there's Harmony he just
[45:35] gets chewed up you know there'll be you
[45:37] know there should be such a you know a
[45:39] panic ring out in hell when the devil
[45:42] tells one of his imps go to the moodly
[45:44] household or go to the no dear household
[45:46] or whatever you go there and trouble
[45:48] them it should be such a cry you know
[45:50] there should be a you know a devil down
[45:52] in Hell having a heart attack having an
[45:54] aneurysm having a stroke being all
[45:56] stressed out because I don't want to go
[45:58] back there do you know what they did to
[45:59] me last week I'm still in a body cast
[46:02] man come on this is not fair it should
[46:04] be that way Hallelujah why because he
[46:08] just gets his lights knocked out and
[46:09] everything are knocked out and somehow
[46:11] it gets dragged back down to Hell and
[46:13] you know he's just in a he's on life
[46:15] support this is how the devil should be
[46:16] when he even is told when he you know
[46:19] one of his zims is told come bother this
[46:21] household
[46:23] Hallelujah that's how we should be why
[46:25] because we're in battle array God's
[46:27] Great Army upon the Earth
[46:30] Hallelujah
[46:32] amen now
[46:34] the how we doing for time we've done
[46:36] okay now in first Timothy the Apostle
[46:40] Paul calls himself a pattern
[46:42] now we'll just read this in in first
[46:44] Timothy 1 11 and 17. he says according
[46:47] to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed
[46:49] god of the Blessed God which is
[46:51] committed to my trust and I thank Christ
[46:53] Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for
[46:55] that he counted me faithful putting me
[46:57] into the ministry who was before a
[47:00] blasphemer a persecutor an injurious but
[47:02] I obtained Mercy because I did it
[47:04] ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of
[47:06] our Lord was exceeding abundant with
[47:09] faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
[47:12] this is a faithful saying and worthy of
[47:14] all exception that Christ Jesus came
[47:16] into the world to save Sinners of whom I
[47:19] am chief how be it for this cause I
[47:21] obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus
[47:23] Christ might show forth all
[47:25] long-suffering for a pattern to them
[47:28] which should Hereafter believe on him to
[47:30] life Everlasting now unto the king
[47:33] Eternal uh Immortal invisible the only
[47:36] wise God be honor and Glory forever and
[47:38] ever amen so the Apostle Paul is telling
[47:41] us that his life is a pattern
[47:43] now Jesus would tell us to pick up our
[47:47] cross deny ourselves pick up our cross
[47:49] and follow him you know Jesus spoke more
[47:51] about us bearing our own cross than he
[47:53] did his own and so we all have a cross
[47:55] to bear
[47:57] we all have a cross you know you know
[47:58] you know a lot of people don't want to
[48:00] talk about this kind of Christianity but
[48:02] he said you're going to pick up your
[48:03] cross and follow him if you're not
[48:05] willing to pick up your cross you can't
[48:06] be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:08] so it's very important that we pick up
[48:10] our own cross now and and and we don't
[48:13] want to drop our cross before the time
[48:16] now a cross is not a besetting sin so
[48:19] I'm just going to put that out there
[48:19] from the get-go because well this is
[48:21] just a thorn the spirit is The Thorn In
[48:23] My Flesh you know I I just can't get rid
[48:26] of this lust of this pornography or this
[48:27] drinking or smoking or lying or whatever
[48:29] it's just a thought in the flesh to keep
[48:30] me humble no
[48:32] no that's just a excuse to keep a devil
[48:35] in your life because that person likes
[48:37] that spirit I mean but we should hate
[48:39] the devil we have no pardon him he has
[48:41] no part in us right we have no time for
[48:43] him there's no business hours open for
[48:45] him do not take his calls don't don't
[48:48] return his emails just just block them
[48:50] on every social media page you can find
[48:52] amen don't don't entertain him he's not
[48:55] here to be entertained he's been here
[48:56] just we're here to stand on his neck
[48:59] right he all he is is a is a welcome mat
[49:03] for your door to wipe your feet on and
[49:05] then you're going through and slam door
[49:06] on his face right so so don't entertain
[49:08] him right I mean so so we're here we
[49:11] must bear our own cross we all have a
[49:14] cross that we must bear
[49:15] now that cross is made and this is just
[49:18] my opinion I was just thinking about
[49:20] these things today a cross is there to
[49:23] actually manifest Jesus Christ
[49:25] now in the Old Testament every book
[49:28] because because every believer actually
[49:30] had to cross the bed wasn't called
[49:31] across in the Old Testament but every
[49:33] every believer has a cross to bear
[49:35] now Noah had the cross of the radical of
[49:39] ridicule of the scoffers
[49:41] he had to be worrying to bear that
[49:43] reproach to actually carry that cross of
[49:45] the scoffers and the mockers making fun
[49:47] of him as he built the ark for 120 years
[49:49] remember it was scientifically
[49:51] impossible for it to rain it never
[49:52] rained before at that time they'd just
[49:55] be due upon the Earth but there's no
[49:56] rain
[49:57] so he had to bear that cross of ridicule
[50:00] but he did
[50:02] right he didn't give up just because of
[50:04] the ridicule you know the critic has no
[50:06] life to give you
[50:07] they don't have the Holy Ghost they
[50:09] don't have the power of God it's amazing
[50:11] the you know yeah they put the life of
[50:13] brother bam under a microscope what if
[50:14] we put their life under the same
[50:16] microscope what kind of fruits would you
[50:18] see out of their lives
[50:21] not even worth one page website
[50:24] so Noah had the ridicule of scoffers
[50:27] Abraham had the burden of lot this is
[50:30] just me I might not be completely right
[50:31] with all these ones but they all
[50:33] everyone had a burden Jacob had the
[50:35] anger of Esau for stealing the
[50:36] birthright from him
[50:38] he had that that he had to live under
[50:40] right Moses had the failure of the dead
[50:43] Egyptian and the rejection of Israel
[50:45] because remember he killed the Egyptian
[50:46] he says basically here I am he says who
[50:48] are you to rule over us you know and
[50:49] then he had to run for his life
[50:51] Ruth had the had the cross to bear of
[50:53] being a moabite even after marrying Boaz
[50:56] you think about it you know not everyone
[50:58] there was spiritual in Israel not
[51:00] everyone saying praise the Lord You're a
[51:01] perfect picture of redemption and the
[51:03] Gentiles are going to come in one day
[51:04] and a gentile bride is going to be
[51:06] married to our Messiah no none of that I
[51:09] said what are you doing here I'm married
[51:10] to Boaz real but you know you know
[51:12] there's kind of a thing where we don't
[51:13] really quite fit in
[51:15] she fitted in boaz's house that was the
[51:17] main thing right because she was married
[51:19] to Boaz but you know it's like us today
[51:21] with other Christians they might even be
[51:23] blessed by our testimonies
[51:25] but there's just something about them
[51:28] that they put us at Arm's Reach
[51:30] because they believe funny things
[51:33] even though yes sure God works in their
[51:35] life yeah we've seen yep okay that's God
[51:37] praise the Lord for you but they keep
[51:38] you at Arm's Reach right who's
[51:40] experienced that why is that because
[51:42] it's like it's it's like it's like Ruth
[51:45] she didn't quite fit in with the rest of
[51:47] Israel but yet she was ordained
[51:50] just like the stars to come into the
[51:53] lineage of Jesus Christ
[51:55] amen
[51:57] David was rejected King he had to live
[52:00] with that cross of what he did with
[52:01] Bathsheba you know and then Absalom
[52:04] being killed and all those things see
[52:06] the devil studies Humanity
[52:10] he's been studying Humanity since the
[52:13] well before the fall because he studied
[52:15] Adam and Eve to find a weak point and
[52:17] then he got in and caused this chaos so
[52:19] he's very good at studying humanity and
[52:21] he's very methodical
[52:23] um with with how he does it he's
[52:26] methodical in his tactics you know he
[52:29] lays traps and snares for us and any
[52:31] hunter worth half of their ability is
[52:34] very methodical in their hunting
[52:36] technique doesn't matter what you're
[52:37] hunting you don't just go wander out
[52:39] there and I'm going to kill a deer good
[52:41] luck yeah you got to know what you're
[52:43] doing
[52:44] right the Devil is a master hunter we
[52:47] should never underestimate him he's very
[52:48] clever he's very good at laying chaps
[52:51] because he knows our Humanity now
[52:54] the same cross that we're called to
[52:56] carry he will use against us to try and
[53:00] destroy us
[53:02] now Moses Moses's cross was the people
[53:05] of Israel
[53:06] he carried them
[53:08] to the promised land
[53:10] he answered all their fussing he prayed
[53:12] for them when they had trouble he you
[53:14] know he spoke to the Rock and the water
[53:16] came he you know he did all those things
[53:18] right and then uh but the crowd but his
[53:22] cross was meant to meant to manifest
[53:25] allow Christ to be manifested through
[53:27] his life as intercessor
[53:30] so so when he carried that cross and he
[53:34] you know the people started fussing he
[53:36] interceded for them when God said I'm
[53:37] going to wipe them out and start with
[53:38] you
[53:40] why because God we had to carry across
[53:43] who's following me tonight the cross we
[53:45] carry is not just to be a burden it's
[53:47] for God to be manifested through that
[53:49] and then so Moses Moses would stand in
[53:51] the gap for Israel and we know that was
[53:53] Christ and Moses being displayed
[53:56] but then that same fussing made him lose
[53:59] his temper
[54:00] and he smote The Rock instead of
[54:03] speaking to the Rock
[54:04] so the devil used that same cross
[54:07] against them to Smite The Rock break the
[54:09] whole pattern of God and not go on the
[54:11] Promised Land
[54:13] because the devil knows how to use our
[54:15] Humanity against us he's very good at it
[54:18] he studied you a lot he started your
[54:20] family you think you know we get all
[54:21] excited I know my family true the
[54:23] devil's like oh yeah I know that I've
[54:24] known that a long time
[54:25] because he studied your weaknesses
[54:27] because he looks where where God begins
[54:30] to bless
[54:31] and he says um I know they're humanity
[54:34] and it it pulls up your family fail
[54:37] and starts using that against you
[54:41] so we all have a cross to beer
[54:43] but our cross is meant to be that the
[54:46] power of God can be manifested in our
[54:47] lives
[54:48] and not for the devil to use it
[54:51] against us
[54:53] that's okay to put it that way
[54:58] now
[55:00] Jesus said except the man be born of
[55:02] water and spirit he'll know as enter
[55:03] into the kingdom he that will follow
[55:05] after me let him deny himself and his
[55:07] own worldly pleasures take up his cross
[55:09] and follow after me the cross is a
[55:11] symbol of death of Agony he that will be
[55:13] a Christian let him strip himself of his
[55:14] own thoughts let him strip himself of
[55:16] his own works let him strip himself of
[55:19] everything denying himself and take up
[55:20] that consecrated cross and follow me
[55:23] daily he that will come after me let him
[55:25] do that that's what Jesus said
[55:29] so now
[55:32] if we are part of this heavenly host
[55:35] that's the Life we'll Live
[55:38] amen if we're part of this heavenly now
[55:40] we're not shooting stars
[55:42] shooting stars gather a lot of attention
[55:44] but they burn up in the atmosphere
[55:46] they're not in position they're not
[55:48] orbiting the Sun
[55:50] they're just flying around right we're
[55:52] not we're not asteroids we're not
[55:53] shooting stars that can just cause
[55:55] damage and Things No we're called to be
[55:57] set in the galaxies
[56:00] right in our in our position
[56:02] and if we are then what happens is is
[56:06] just as the just as the stars as we read
[56:08] in Psalms and I'm going to finish with
[56:10] this speech so that now that's preaching
[56:14] some people think that's a pretty
[56:16] picture actually that's God speaking to
[56:17] the world and you know the Earth is
[56:19] actually in a perfect part of the of the
[56:21] Milky Way to see it all if we're in a
[56:24] different part of the Milky Way you
[56:25] wouldn't see what you see
[56:26] so God put this planet here for us to
[56:29] look up and see that
[56:30] why because he wanted us to be in the
[56:32] right position to see the word
[56:34] Hallelujah
[56:36] amen he's put us in the right position
[56:37] to see the word
[56:39] amen
[56:40] so now if we are one of those Stars we
[56:42] say Lord may I carry my cross
[56:45] might be sold out
[56:47] amen may not be I will like like Lucifer
[56:50] said I will
[56:51] it's not I will but it's not no it
[56:53] should be not my will but thy will be
[56:55] done Lord
[56:58] amen so I'm going to leave that there
[57:02] okay
[57:04] but just as that preaches should not our
[57:07] lives preach
[57:09] speak as a church as a as families when
[57:13] people see you say this is something
[57:14] about you what makes you different
[57:16] well let's sit down
[57:18] I'll tell you who makes this different
[57:20] not what
[57:22] the Lord Jesus Christ makes us different
[57:25] this word this revealed word makes us
[57:27] different which is the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:29] amen
[57:31] so let's be an array against the enemy
[57:34] every time against it comes against us
[57:36] just complete victory
[57:38] Hallelujah you say well he keeps
[57:40] whipping me just get up again don't stay
[57:42] down get up say Lord Train My Hands to
[57:44] War change my mind train my mind to
[57:46] think on the right things not to go on
[57:48] conversations with the devil you know I
[57:50] was telling the Lord I was praying the
[57:51] Lord say Lord I just want a fellowship
[57:53] with you in my mind I don't want to have
[57:55] a fellowship with the spirit I want a
[57:56] fellowship with you Lord Jesus
[57:58] amen I think if we kind of thought that
[58:00] way you know we thought God's thoughts
[58:02] which are his word
[58:03] we would we would we would just really
[58:06] sock one in the devil's face
