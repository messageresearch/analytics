so we're just going to go to ephesians 1 and we're going to start from verse 3. i'm going to go down to verse 12. so verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace and he hath made us accepted in the beloved i'm glad when god makes something he does a good job hallelujah in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory amen who first trusted in christ let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning lord jesus how great you are lord lord we marvel it lord the things you do lord we marvel at you and your greatness oh god your great mercy that you've extended towards us lord we're so thankful that you have allowed us to receive it dear god and we just want to pray father this morning may just come anoint the service lord may anoint every heart oh god take all doubts of whisper whispering doubts and troubles away oh god i pray that there will be no room here for the devil to work but lord may you work oh god may you have all liberty all all room to do what you want to do in this service lord we want to thank you lord that lord we're still feasting in our hearts of what you did at camp but lord we want to thank you you're not lord limited to that geographical location but lord you would never leave us nor forsake us dear god i just pray you just meet us the same way you meet us at camp oh god a very real way lord we just want to submit ourselves under your hand oh god take the service now lord may you speak and may you also be the hearer in us oh god grant it father we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats i just want to take a um take a small thought from from verse 4 if you want to put it up there but it says that that we should be according as he has chosen us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so this is god's purpose before the foundation of the world that he was going to have a people that would be holy and without blame before him in love now i'm so glad god knows all things amen he knows all things you know there's not there's nothing he doesn't know see he knows how good he knows how bad he knows our weaknesses he knows our strength you know he knows everything about us but yet he would make us in such a way that we would stand before him without blame there's no blame hallelujah amen so yeah i just i just pray by the time we walk out these doors we just say glory you know we rejoice and we just appreciate more what he has done for us amen so but we must understand that we're living in a day that there that there would be the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god there'll be a revealing of the sons and daughters of god and we know if we go through the book of revelation that book of you know revelation it means an unveiling so something that's hidden something that's already there but it needs to be unveiled just like a artist would would would paint a picture and i've been to one of brother nathaniel proviso's unveilings of his paintings and they're a real masterpiece you know and you know there's so you know there's a big canvas you can see the size of it he paints paintings like this kind of size there's a curtain in front of it but it comes to be the unveiling and you can kind of guess what's behind it but when it's finally unveiled you can see his you can see the heart of the artist manifested in his handiwork and it's the same with a statue you know they'll put a sheet over a statue maybe give a speech pull the pull the um sheet off and before the sheet comes down you can kind of guess what it is but then finally when it's unveiled you can see it and all of its glory all of its you know how great it is whatever you know and it's the same thing with us you know we came into this world veiled right there was a potential under under the veil there's a potential i mean that that wasn't manifested upon the earth but it was there i'm so thankful that when we meet the lord we don't become a son then we already were sons and daughters i mean but by you receiving the holy ghost god is acknowledging to you you are my child you are my son you are my daughter and i'm proving that you are my child by giving you my spirit amen it says in galatians because we were sons not because we became but because we were sons we received the holy ghost hallelujah so so there is a people upon the earth down through even down through time you can go you know from from genesis to revelation and we know we're living in you know bible days but there's been a people in every age that have been veiled but then god takes the veil off of them and manifests what god has purposed them on the earth to manifest hallelu you can take david as a shepherd boy he's just a little shepherd boy but enemies to be a king i mean in him is to actually unify the tribes you have to take full possession of the promised land that's veiled in him and god pours the anointing upon him as a shepherd boy he begins to unveil what's in david remember david did not become king because he was anointed that anointing just manifested the kingship that was in him so it's the same thing with the bride of christ the anointing of the word comes upon you to bring out what's already in you hallelujah so it's like a seed you know you can a lot of people planting crops and so on in in a seed say a pumpkin seed that has the potential to grow pumpkins right but it's just sitting here on the desk it won't do nothing but we know within it it has potentials right to manifest what's within it but it needs it needs the right atmosphere needs right soil needs some moisture upon it and when the conditions are right it comes to life hallelujah i say the conditions are right in this age for a people who come to a full adoption i'm into the change of the body hallelujah i mean so i believe i'm looking at people and you know we have to really look at ourselves and say god i'm your workmanship i'm not my own workmanship one day i tried to be mine workmanship i just failed miserably but when i gave my life into your hands then you begin to mold me and shape me as as as you saw fit hallelujah and we are his workmanship amen so to be without without blame before him in love now from from the beginning when sin came into the world there's been a blame game the devil's been playing a blame game because you know let's just read in in revelations chapter 12 uh very one of my well i have favorite scripture because i love to read where we triumph and the devil gets defeated i love to read those kind of things so devil this is your end this is my end this is your end you get off here and i go up here and you have to go there because your predecessor had to go there but i'm pretty decent to go up there oh look and that's just how it is do you like to read those things makes me feel good devil i know your end i'm just going to remind you one more time devil you're on to the lake of fire you're going to burn we're going to see thee it says and isaac narrowly look upon me and say is this the man is this the man that did weaken the nations is this really him this guy this guy is it really him that's what it says in scripture it's going to be manifested we're going to hallelujah but yeah when he's no more we'll be still going on we have no expiry date hallelujah hallelujah revelations 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night so there's a blame game that's been going on the accuser of the brethren they did this they did this here they thought this here they went into this there's a lot of blame game going on but there comes a time when the blame game comes to an end remember because we are predestinated that we should appear before him without blame and in love right we read that at ephesians so but notice this and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice he heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time and you know what's good about time it comes to an end hallelujah so sure i'm just running out of time the devil's running out of time hallelujah glory what about you no i've got all day i've got all eternity i've got time you know oh boy i won't go into those kind of subjects you know with little children trying to get them ready you know they think they've got all day we've got all day the devil is running he's out of time but you see he's the accuser of the brethren right and if he if he has leverage on the children of god then he has a right to actually keep them under his dominion before sin came into the world adam and eve as one the man and the woman they had dominion over the earth this was their realm they were gods over this earth but then when sin came in the whole who was in charge the hierarchy were yo they were dethroned and the devil became the god of this world and since that time god has been rebuilding his people until finally there's a full restoration that adam's fallen race are no longer adam's fallen race but they are the redeemed ones of the lord and now they are back in full control over the earth now we know that that that control starts in us right it doesn't it doesn't start with the world first it starts with the people hallelujah so now when the devil was cast out of your life hallelujah that was just foreshadowing what god is going to do to this entire world right but it was just shown in you the devil remember when we were born the devil was in control of us right ephesians chapter 2 tells us that we walked we once walked according to the prince of the power of the air and and paul does not exclude anyone from that he's saying that's how we were but then god rich in mercy harley manifested himself to us showed us to where are his children and what happened he the devil was dethroned right and then god came down and he took up the throne in our hearts hallelujah so once we're under the anointing of the devil and we had no trouble really because there's no battle amen we led her yo we were led by him we followed him we did what he wanted us to do but then there became a rebellion you know some people say rebellion's a bad thing not always because the because the bride of christ is rebelling this is revolution this is revolution holy we are actually having a revolution against the devil in his control where are free people amen we have a constitution this is our bill of rights as our this is our declaration of independence amen and our god is here to enforce what's in the bill to us hallelujah so now no more do we have to be led by his spirit now more no more is there every strife hatred malice you know separation between brethren gossip yo the asset of gossiping and hurt and strife and trying to be better than other people and you know war and fighting and division that's not in my declaration of independence harley my dick declaration of independence tells me there are people come together one body amen many members but one body one spirit governs them doesn't matter how old how young where they're from hallelujah but one spirit amen by once we were baptized into one body hallelujah so now there's been a revolution glory hallelujah and that revolution has been going on until finally there's not a people that will you know moses could only take the people out of egypt but that fallen nature that was within them couldn't be taken out of them satan could still accuse israel but they've done this they've done this they've done this even though god instituted the blood of the lamb and bulls and goats had just covered sin and now those people who died in faith under that blood had to go into paradise and wait for someone to come and clear actually all of their sins away imagine you imagine what it'd be like in paradise you know you're waiting malachi comes in he prophesied of the forerunner then there's a 400-year gap of silence you know no doubt believers were coming in as well but then but then there's a big you know simon was in the temple as an old man i'm not going to die the lord showed me until i see the lord's christ then he sees him he says lord he picks them up says lord let thy servant depart in peace for i have seen thy salvation i don't know how much longer he lived after that but from the time that you know he saw jesus as a baby and when jesus came into his ministry he would have passed on so then he would have stepped into paradise hallelujah hallelujah yeah because they would have been talking here comes the seed of the woman and you know they would have been looking for that serpent bruiser to come and then here comes one in and says brothers sisters i've held him i've held him hallelujah came into the temple to be circumcised and the lord led me he told me that i'd see him and now i've seen him i picked him up hallelujah he's just in his infant form but he's going to become a man he's on his way harlow the expectation begins to build why because the blame game is going to be silenced harley the blame is going to be silenced and actually the one who calls it all is all going to end up on his head hallelujah amen yeah yeah and then and then no doubt john the baptist would come in because remember simon and then anna would have come in as well i was blind physically but spiritually i could see 20 20. harley and the lord led me right to his messiah hallelujah and and and i saw him just like simon did hallelujah and then and then john comes in they say who are you i was the voice crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the lord and isaiah would have said hallelujah i saw you in vision hallelujah then you're manifested glory what happened i baptized him the spirit of god descended bottom like a dove the lord showed me that what happened i saw it no one else saw it but i saw it hallelujah oh my what kind of expectation we'll be building then finally the thief on the cross enters hallelujah where'd you see him he was hanging right there i saw the lamb how he is being offered he was right next to me and he said today you'll be with me in paradise and say well here i am here's paradise where is he oh boy and then the door comes open then the lord's presence walks in hallelu then he himself walks into the room hallelujah and they say this is the one we've been looking for he says children there was a lot of seen sin attributed to you the blood of bulls and ghosts covered but my blood's fresh on the cross hallelujah i've wiped it clean so now the accuser cannot blame you you're going to be presented to me without blame because it's taken care of hallelujah there rose up and they just had a rejoicing time if we could just recognize the condition we are in now irrespective of troubles and and and this guy that fights and and complexes whatever it may be i'm not talking about those things today i'm talking about the condition of your soul i'm talking about the condition of the real you hallelujah because remember if god thought of us before the foundation of the world he didn't think of us down on this earth with our hurts and our pains and our troubles no he thought of you as redeemed he thought of you and your new body olivia gathered around his throne that's how he thought of you glory hallelujah so if you think about it now if you've been if the lord has made you a new creature you receive the holy ghost you can say you say brother ben i have received the holy ghost his word is more than life to me doesn't matter yo yo it doesn't matter what his word says i believe it something in me says amen to this bible and something in me says i want to live this word by his spirit i'm a new creature hallelujah then what's happened you're on heaven's highway hallelujah and it don't matter what happens to this guy i mean because your soul is sealed in hallelujah you are already just like those in paradise saying hallelujah glory to the lamb you're in that same condition you've just got to catch up to where they are and these bodies will be changed hallelujah so i think we can walk out of here happy dan you think so amen so now now when the you know brother brahm says when the holy ghost came down on pentecost he says it was the abstract of the deed so an abstract deed means like if you want to buy a piece of property you ought to make sure no one else has claims on that land if they do you've got to sort out the dispute that's what the blood of jesus christ did because the devil said no these people are mine because they're born in sin i made them fall they're born with a fallen nature but the lord says no no my blood has purchased them they do not belong to you hallelujah you know we never did belong to the devil we were never ever his his we may be under were under his influence but we never ever belonged to him we've always been gods harlow you may have been up to hearing drugs out in the world you were gods you may have been up to hearing religion you were gods but then one day he found you hallelujah glory hallelujah you know we have something worth shouting about hallelujah so there they were he said the abstract so so so when the holy ghost came down on the day of pentecost god was saying now every every claim against these people has been struck off by my blood so now these people were spirit-born free people and the blame game could not be played so the devil's now how can i get in because remember if he has a claim on a people on the earth then then the program of god is kind of in a way stuck hallelujah so now here's the people who are upon the earth and and and the devil can't accuse him of nothing so he brings in people and and and you can read it in the book of acts it's not very far through there were those who have the pharisees that became believers but why are they called pharisees if they're believers you know if they're really believers they would have got rid of that pharisee spirit but they were carrying that with them maybe they quoted the quotes and they and they played the part but in them was not a converted soul and so they begin to bring in well the people have to become jews before they become christians there's a lot of trouble who all bible readers know about those things so it was the light of a former rage trying to come in and affect what god was doing in that day and so there was a battle with that and then now the devil comes in and says now i'm going to pervert their baptism i'm going to pervert the godhead i'm going to take the take it that instead of being an anointed people it's just an anointed ministry amen and then there became a separation between us the holy priesthood and just the laity and now only the choir can sing now the people can't sing and we don't sing anything happy we just have george and chant and if you ever need if you ever have insomnia that will cure it real quick who said george and chant oh but we've got to be reverent and holy yo david with the symbols i don't believe that little things saying you know bang the symbols there would have been a lot of noise going on oh there would have been a lot of rejoicing hallelujah oh but we're not built that way i tell you what i've seen people who are stiff as a board you give them if this is in the world now you give them a few drinks and they're and they're rejoicing they're dancing they're laughing they're noisy like the noisy fellas why because they're partaking of the same spirit that's being passed around now how much more now be yourself of course but you know how much more when the spirit of god is passed around hallelujah you can be have all these complexes and trouble and all this thing but then suddenly i mean you begin to drink and you begin to drink and then you loosen up and bring into worship and praise god and be happy about it and why what's happened why you actually realize i'm part of this part of this word this is the real me amen so the devil began to get blamed he could lay upon god's children down through the ages now we understand that the blood of jesus christ atoned for the ignorance of the people and in the in the old testament there's a sin offering for ignorance right so even though you know people like martin luther they would they were you know yesterday was actually a wonderful day of celebration do you know why because it's reformation day it was the day that martin luther took his 91 thesis and nailed it to the church door in wittenberg and the reformation was on so it was a great day hallelujah while the world is celebrating death we can celebrate life we can celebrate the beginning of liberty for the children of god hardly you say well he didn't go all the way out no no he didn't he was prophesied not to go all the way out right but but the process of i will restore said the lord began to happen life began to come back into the church that was that was not there in the dark ages so happy reformation day for yesterday hallelujah hallelujah we should we should celebrate those things i mean because we are a product of what began there this is not a reformation this is a restoration but it had to start somewhere hallelujah it's just like when the lord start began to hold get a hold of your life maybe you were still a smoking drinking monk like luther was but you're not that today i trust hallelujah but you started somewhere so don't despise where you started from at least you started somewhere unless you've gone this far just keep walking on hallelujah hallelujah so i rejoice halloween nothing it's reformation day that was reformation day before it was halloween just like christmas is not about santa claus some geriatric scandinavian honor on a sleigh you know it's not about that it's about the birth of the lord we say he wasn't born then but we can still celebrate it the birth of jesus anywho um so there was there was there was a blame game that could be passed down now if the devil has ground to accuse then they then the sons of god cannot fully manifest who they are who's ever had that little feeling oh but you're guilty you know you feel you know you feel guilt or you did this it might not even be sinful but there's something that's just weighing on you who's had that you've got to pray for something and there's this little voice said oh but you didn't do this you did this or you know it's just what is it it's the devil trying to pull you down from your god-given position because he's trying to pull you down to his level right but you've got to realize now the blame game has come to an end there is a people upon the earth that there is actually nothing the devil can accuse them of hallelujah because remember it is not it's not us trying to wash ourselves right it's not us trying to purify ourselves you know wesley came with the second work of grace sanctification and they had a method of living a holy life that's why they're called methodists but that was under the man age once they had a self ability of being sanctified right but yet got on it but now that was under the man age we're not in a man age we're in the eagle age right where the lord can lift us up give us faith to lift us up above the habits of the flesh above sin harley those things that they had to do in their own ability i mean god just changes our nature thank you sir god just changes our nature that the things he once did we don't do them anymore oh is it is it by human will no that's just god changes your nature there's nothing in you for it you can't help that glory amen you don't have to you know we don't have to live in a monastery we don't have to go live up in the bush somewhere and never see the light of day to be rapture ready we can walk in this world isn't it amazing god can actually so condition us and i believe he has and if you haven't been conditioned say lord condition me with your holy spirit you can walk in satan's eden hallelujah remember adam and eve fell in god's eden but the bride is going to walk through satan's eden and overcome hallelujah you know where the prophet said the prophet said that eve was actually predestined to fall god knew she would fall but there's a woman in the end time that's predestinated not to fall holy so that's our destiny we are actually destined not to fall to the devil's lies i mean sure he may beat us down a few times but there'll come a time the thing that we wore against maybe we've been warring a very long time but there comes actually a time when the battle ends just like two two two boxes in a ring you know they can be fighting for many rounds but eventually one gets a knockout punch and the devil can be fighting you know i heard i think it was um i think his brother josh bennett i can't remember which one he brought it out but you know muhammad ali was fighting george foreman and and he studied him i think was george foreman and he just realized he has to last more than seven rounds and if he can outlast him he'll be worn out then then he can give the knockout punch so he took it for seven rounds i think it was or six rounds and in the seventh round george foreman was worn out and then that's when he went in for the kill and won the one the bout now we've been down through seven church ages and the devil's been fighting us and beating us and punching us but remember we just got to outlast him but now is the time for the clock has changed this is a different season this is a different time this is not a time of winter and darkness and hardness and no life this is a time of life this is a time of victory hallelujah hallelujah so now here we come down to the end time god pours his spirit out in his um in azusa street restoring the gifts of the spirit but then of course it all denominated and did what it would do but then god had to bring a restoration prophet to restore a word you know some people think that god moves in our church or at camp wherever just because of enthusiasm this has got nothing to do with enthusiasm this god do with god's word i mean why did why did israel have a revival amen when when they left egypt to win to the promised land because of a word they received why did caleb take his mountain because of a word he received hallelujah why did david become king like he did because he received a word the mighty men gathered around him because they knew he was coming into power it was a word they received hallelujah why did why did they why were they staring like drunk people from the upper room it was a word they received tarry in jerusalem until you're endued within power from on high they received that word and they went up there expecting and they received what they expected and then peter could say no this is that spoken by the prophet joel what you are seeing is the fulfillment of scripture in your day hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i this is not enthusiasm oh but you're enthusiastic oh yeah of course i am of course i am i'm laughing all the way to the bank i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory because jesus set me free hardly when i could not free myself he freed me he broke the shackles i say father break these shackles he said yes i'd have been waiting for you to ask me hallelujah hallelujah that just dispels all the gloom hallelujah i think we should celebrate shouldn't shouldn't church be a celebration shouldn't we be celebrating eternal life lord you've imparted eternal life into me i'm not waiting for it to come it's already here hallelujah hallelujah i don't you know eternity's going to be full of happy people real happy people hallelujah amen so the blame game was being played the accuser of the brethren amen worked down through seven church ages even though the believers down through those ages those that received the word for their day was sealed away hallelujah so we're going to see luther there we're going to see those who sprung up out of that whatever movement it was you know we'll see them there we'll see those under under under wesley and you know we'll see them we'll see the real pentecostals there hallelujah you know this is just a con you know we have restored to a true pentecost we're actually a pentecostal people not an azusa street pentecost but a real pentecost hallelujah but now we have the book open so what they were longing for where it's actually in our possession hallelujah now so so there so god had to bring a restoration prophet to restore us back that what we believed the devil could not lay claim on us we don't have his baptism you know you know the catholic church has openly said that baptism in the name of the father son holy ghost is an umbilical cord that ties people back to rome they have openly said it that's been cut amen we have been baptized in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost that name is the lord jesus christ so we've actually done what jesus told peter to do and peter preached what jesus said hallelujah you know the godhead we know he's one god manifested you know brother braham says that god is not one like your finger and why is that because your finger only has one manifestation are you following me he's not two he's one god was a pillar of fire he's a cloud he came as melchizedek theophany form hallelujah appeared like an old man to gideon with a staff all the way down through a different manifest same god hallelujah so now here here god has restored his word so now that there's actually a people upon the earth that are blameless you say what about my sin oh that's been taken care of that's been taken care of you know i love it where it says in first john 2 the devil got no claim on you or me he got no claim what about my mistakes there's blood what about my guilt there's blood what about you know what about my humanity this blood what about i just say the wrong thing sometimes there's blood harley what about those mistakes i make there's blood what about those ill feelings against people there's blood glory there's a blood now let's go to let's go to first john there's blood it ain't gonna run out this is not something oh i wonder if this is going to last it's going to last by one offering he has perfected forever then that are sanctified by one offering not year after year after year after year it doesn't run out amen first john 2 and 1 my little children these things i write unto you that you sin not if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is a propitiation for our sins and not for our sins only but also for the sins of the whole world now if we go back to that first verse you know sin we know really is unbelief brother bam tells us sin is unbelief and what you see this world this world is a manifestation of unbelief so sometimes we struggle with the promise yep okay i'll just say yes just on my behalf sometimes you think how's this going to happen you know because you sometimes we get so fixed on what these five senses declare but as i think brother tazo said look beyond the circumstance to the province right so don't look at what you see with your five senses but sometimes you know you really feel that sick or you really see all you see is how's this ever going to work right yeah so it's just my eyes that's oh boy anyway pray for me you know but so so if any so he says sin not so that he said not so don't disbelieve but if any man i say sin disbelieve now we'll go back to the first part of the chapter say this is for believers we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous now we must understand advocate as a person who publicly supports or recommends someone that's that's the definition from the from from the dictionary so an advocate is a person who publicly supports or recommends someone that's an advocate so now when the holy ghost comes into your life god is making a public declaration i am that person's advocate because he is showing you and the world this one's mine alison advocate works on your behalf we've got the best legal team in the world huh we've got the best legal team because brother ham says that our judge became our eternity and the case is settled hollis we have the best advocate there can ever be hallelujah it doesn't matter what the best law firm in the world can't touch this we have the best advocate so you've got a trust that's anchored in your soul i have one working for me where what i cannot do he's the one that can do it hallelujah he knows all the technicality of the law he knows all the bylaws because he wrote it right he knows how the war he knows the correct interpretation of the law no one can twist it from him because he knows exactly what the law says at least the devil can't come along and twist it to him and say well these people have done this is ah that's not what this means this is not what this law says you are misinterpreting my word to try and hold it against these people but you should have seen devil the day you got cast out and i got enthroned i was there i became their advocate and they realized it they'll say in reality he always was our advocate but you've got to realize god's are fighting my battles hallelujah i don't just think it i know he's fighting my battles he's working on on my behalf he's not angry at me he's not against me he's for me as the apostle paul because they have god is for us who can be against us that's a big statement but it's true if the creator of heavens and earth is for me he's not against us he's not angry at us he's not waiting for us to trip up and then he's going to deal with us that's not how he works hallelujah we may trip others like a child you know learns to walk falls over who no parent in their right mind gets angry at their child because they're trying to walk no parent in a sound mind would get angry oh you did that before yeah but no no you know you dust them off pick them up you know calm them down you can do it honey you can do it hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i yeah because remember a little child they have a there's something in them they can't describe it but they want to walk they want to talk they want to have fellowship hallelujah so it's like us there's something in us when god turns our heart there's something in us lord i want to walk with you and we may trip and fall and say the wrong thing and do this and then yeah but god just picks us up correct us no do it this way you can do it hallelujah and then and he just lets us continue on but he's not looking for oh i knew they'd do that you know he's not he's not against us he is for you everyone say jesus is for me he's fought he's not against me he's for me hallelujah so i've got the best advocate ever and he took up my case hallelujah i didn't have to fall i gotta find this great legal team no i'll take up your case because before the foundation world i saw you winning this case and actually the whole trial was turned on the accuser hallelujah imagine being imagine being the defendant and actually somehow the trial just turns and then now the accuser or whatever is called a legal jargon actually becomes a defendant and now they're under the microscope it's amazing people will critics criticize brother brown all day long but that microscope will never go in their lives someone who lived a very public life the community knew who he was knew his character knew who he was and they'll criticize it till the cows come home but they will never let that magnifying glass come upon them but so the devil will will try and play a blame game with you but you did this and you were really there right and he'll blame you for this and for this and for this but you know you know sometimes we're too polite you let him rattle off and rattle off and rattle off you gotta say hold on i have the talking stick you don't have any talking stick right no actually devil that was a result of what you did hallelujah it's not attributed to me no more because the blood of jesus christ has cleansed me you know god has the power to forget god actually doesn't know see see see for us something hap someone does something to us we still have it lodged in the back of our mind they did that right and then maybe you know we can pull it out and you know you know i trust we don't if we're christian we know we we actually if we're christians we let things go we actually surrender and so how do you let something go you surrender the right to use it against someone that's actually real forgiveness when you surrender the right to hold a pain against someone well they did this and they probably did do that but you surrender the right don't carry that kind of stuff hallelujah and so but god doesn't have it in the back of his mind what you did even this morning on the way to churchill you know whatever he doesn't have that in the back of his mind when when sin is confessed he says he is faithful and just to forgive us and it actually is wiped from his memory that's how great god is hallelujah so now so now what happens is all right let's just go back to first john let's just read a little bit and then i'll just continue on first john 1 7. let's go verse 5 rather first john this then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all but me but if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another so it's us and god and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from what's that word all sin what is the light is the manifested word for your day so if we walk in it how do you walk and accept it and say yes lord beat unto me according to your word and you walk in it see sometimes it's only one thing at a time you've got to give your life you give your life now you're going to get baptized now you walk in that then now you know you just keep walking and walking walking but if we walk in that light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another that's why when people leave the world they leave god we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin hallelujah so so now but but but then here comes mr blame game and says you've done this and you've done this and you've done this and you've done this and you've done this and he can keep going on and on and on and on and on you say hold on i confess that i made it right i'm walking in in the light now this is not this is not mental gymnastics this is reality i'm walking in the word of the lord i've confessed it right the blood of jesus christ cleanses me from all sin so what you're blaming me of you can't accuse me of because it's done it's taken care of hallelujah you say this is very elementary no no we got to get the guilt away you know our past use your past for god's glory your past you know we take the you know there are six cities of refuge that that joshua put in the promised land right now one of some of those are actually garrison cities of the enemy so beforehand the devil had his people in there and it was actually an enemy stronghold but then once joshua came in and drove them out it became a city of refuge for the believer so once upon a time we take the woman at the well for example she had a man problem but then the seventh man she met was her real husband right so now here she is she had this trying to find love in all the wrong places and just gets hurts and hurts and hurts and hurts and the more hurts we get where that gives place for the devil to manifest himself are you following me right but then when the seventh husband came he cleared that out and then now so so imagine now that pentecost has come believers begin to come i believe she is in the upper room so now you're a young sister and you've just walked in the steps of the woman at the world you've actually lived her kind of life and then you come in among these people and say no one will understand me here but you feel a draw to the lord the lord's dealing drawing with you but then but then the devil always your whispers say cease no no one will understand you you don't fit in here but then but then you're the woman at the well you can actually put your shoulder over that sister and you can begin to testify i've walked where you've walked i understand your struggles i understand you're hurt i understand we what's happened it used to be a so you could either let the devil use your past against you because sharon rose's little eyes were crossing in pain before she passed away and so she he could actually enter into that burden foreign foreign they know what they're being signed up for because they oh i want to be a sniper or maybe they're good shots they get drafted into that you know training but with us we don't know what we're signing up for right but god can use the training that we received to win the battle so god doesn't waste nothing god don't waste nothing everything we go through in life is for a purpose it's for his purpose hallelujah but the devil comes along and says you did this um so um this is um oh who's the laborers him hey i've ceased from my own works i've entered into rest hallelujah amen fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i'll be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when they'll walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopian seba for thee since that was precious in my sight oh my are we precious in his sight one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds you know they found a meteorite between there's a there's an asteroid belt between i think it's mars and jupiter and they found an asteroid in that belt and it's basically all iron and nickel i believe and it's i don't know the figure is some hundred yeah yeah quite trillion billion dollars or something ridiculous that's just an asteroid we're we're worth more than that asteroid we are more than just a dead hunk of metal floating around orbiting the sun why because this is the place where god god's chosen place of worship hallelujah we're worth more than those things you say i'm just a little nothing no no you're a little something my nothing isn't something hallelujah we are the apple of his eye he loves us hallelujah amen since that was precious in my sight thou hast been honorable and i have loved thee well how are we honorable because we take him at his word well it's not our ability it's we take him at his word and i have lovely therefore will i give mean for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee i'll bring thy seat from the east and gather from the west i'll say to the north give up unto the south keep not back bring my sons from fire and my daughters from the ends of the earth everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him bring forth the blind people that have ears um i sign the death that have ears let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth yeah my witnesses said the lord and my servants whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me i even i am the lord and besides me there is no savior i have declared and have saved i have showed um i have showed when there was no strange gods among you therefore yeah my witnesses saith the lord that i am god hallelujah and what do we see what do we see actually in our lives we see that he is god hallelujah hallelujah and then we go to isaiah 54 and then we're just going to wind this up a little bit we're going to go to revelations 10. but it says isaiah 54 and we're going to read from verse 14 and righteousness shall thou be established he's talking about you isn't it amazing when you can read hey he's talking about me when he's talking about the devil he's talking about the devil's not talking about me but this is talking about me hallelujah remember this is a love letter i was telling someone it um i'm at work this week the bible is a love letter you got to fall in love with him hallelujah amen now in righteousness thou shalt be established thou shalt be far from oppression thou shall not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold i have created the smith that blot the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy hallelujah oh why is that exciting devil we know who made you and you're coming to an end he's just an instrument in god's hand no weapon that is formed against he shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against him judgment thou shalt condemn why shall you condemn that tongue that rises against the judgment because the blood there's blood for me amen there's blood for me that we because remember we would appear before him blameless without blame and love hallelujah so you've got to condemn the tongue of the devil this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord not my own righteousness but the lord's righteousness hallelujah now if this is so which it is then god has taken a people out from the from the filthy hands of the devil and has redeemed them back as sons and daughters of god that now what they were ordained to be they are today now we are the sons of god the bible says now we are not where we right now right now and if it wasn't right now it's right now hallelujah that now is the time for the full manifestation of the sons and daughters of god now if we are sons and daughters of god we have a dominion amen we have a dominion that we have domain over now the devil will come along and try and get us to think you have no authority but we do have authority we may not have power but we have authority amen as a son and daughter of god you have authority over those who are not sons and daughters of god now i'm talking about the devil now okay because the devil he tries to think no no no i will get rid of the family of god and i will reign upon this earth but god has other plans god has other plans he said satan you are a fired servant now we've been through this a servant can never become a son because the life that's in the father is not in the servant it's in the children hallelujah and his royal blood now flows through my veins amen so now a servant can never become a son and god never wanted his sons and daughters to be servants right so the devil had a job description to do as the song leader in heaven but he went beyond the job description tried to become a god right gathered angels to himself and he got fired hallelujah he got fired amen he got fired from his job so now he we are fighting a fired servant now if you think about someone who has a job here okay if you have a job you have authority within your job to do certain tasks right i have authority in my job to release results to customers and do testing and and develop methods and different things in my job right so i have authority but as soon as i leave my job i have no authority to do those things i'm not even allowed on the grounds like through the security because i've got to go through about five swipe doors to get into the lab it's not just a wandering out kind of thing i can go to the reception if i have no swipe card but then i've got to actually meet with someone who's in the you know in the interior of the building we ever got to come out i've got to sign in they escort me and they're going to sign into another place go through some doors and finally i'm in but if i'm an employee i have the access i have the swipe card right to get into where i need to go and i have authority to to dwell in that position now the devil seems to think that someone who is fired can still dwell in a position he got fired he has no authority to take our position he got fired from the job as being the song leader in heaven as as leading the worship hallelujah but he got fired so now if i left my job or if i got fired god forbid and i try and go into the lab they have the right to to either get security or call the police and i'll be forcibly removed from that place hallelujah and if i cause trouble no doubt they'll get a trespass order on me hallelujah why on earth do we let the devil he's been kicked out why do we let him come in where he has no authority to dwell he has no authority to dwell in me he has no right to be in control of me he has no right to govern my thought life govern my prayer life govern my worship govern my walk govern how i treat my family govern how i treat my brothers and sisters govern how i treat the world he has no right but yeah for some reason he just swans in and he swans out and then he blames us for doing it we've gotta we've gotta get the police i'm talking about the holy ghost agent he's the best security hallelujah you know we've gotta we've actually got to get him lord jesus kick this guy out he got fired he has no right you have all the right lord come and dwell here forever lord hallelujah but but we have the right to actually sign a trespass order against the devil and kick him out hallelujah we have the authority to kick him out of our homes dave elaine welcome at 138 joel street stokes valley heaven is but hell is not hallelujah hallelujah and if he tries to come in so hold on satan you're a fired servant i'm a son of god this worth is actually my dominion we'll inherit it one day but as i'm walking on this earth and when you come across my path i have right to kick you out hallelujah amen you know and the accuser comes along and he blames us for things you got to say hold on your eviction notice i can't remember who said it this is the devil's eviction notice yes right hallelujah we're going to read him the eviction notice in my name says the lord i shall cast you out satan these signs shall follow them that believe thy hands upon the sick they shall recover my name i'll cast out devils speak with new tongues if you drink any deadly thing it shall not harm you you know mark 16. amen so we need to re we we need to stand on our god given rights hallelujah and god doesn't say you better not stand on your rights today god wants us to stand on our rights he loves it you know he loves when people take him at his word hallelujah amen so let's just go to revelations 10 real quick and then we'll um and then we'll call the musicians to come now in revelations 10 we have the mighty angel come down with an open book an anointing comes down from heaven with the open book the seals have been loosed the thunders have added and we know that the seven thunders uh were interpreted with the opening of the seven seals right but then there comes a time now where where john who in previous chapters was wasn't even allowed to look at the book he's now commanded to go and take the book and eat the book and become one with that book hallelujah so the title deed that adam and eve lost in the beginning has to be restored back now i'm kind of being a bit of a historian right now because this has already happened right we're not looking for it to come it's already happened but we're going to realize who we are we're going to realize lord everything that brother brown says all that adam and eve lost has now been restored as in a position of sonship over the earth over the devil hallelujah and the voice this is this is 10 and 10 and 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it up and eat it up and it shall be in my belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i'd eaten it and my belly was bitter whatever it's sweet to talk about but it's got to purge a lot of stuff out right but but now that's the thing though since the prophet went off the scene people have just been eating the book right talking about the quotes and talking about the scriptures singing out ties together and discussing and debating things but there's got to come a time where the eating goes down to speaking right where the contents of the book this is the book where the contents of this becomes a lived voice amen it says and he said unto me thou shalt thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so now john we know is a symbol in the book right just like john was taken up after the end of revelations 3 one man in a vision being taken up represents a whole body of people in a rapture right so and then john in history we know after after he was on the isle of patmos he went back to ephesus and he passed to the church there till he passed away he didn't he didn't go before many people's nations tongues and prophesy well this is speaking about an end time people that have a book that's come open to them and has been placed placed in their in their hearts hallelujah so now we're living in a season who's eaten the book what does that mean i've become one with the lord jesus christ he is that book hallelujah so now that now there has to come a season where it's not just eating the book and it's perched things out and it's sweet in the mouth but now it's coming time to speak they must prophesy again it's not a different prophecy that the you know from the word it's just speaking what has been spoken again so the same life that was lived in the book of acts has now manifested again hallelujah but it's actually now god is going to take our lips hallelujah which once spoke cursings and and all kind of division and gossip and and hatred of malice and strife he's going to use those same lips to tear satan's kingdom down and i'm not talking about destroying natural nations here i'm about tearing satan's kingdoms down out of people's lives highly once the devil had a whole bunch of a fortress in someone's life god will anoint you and you'll speak to that person it'll be god speaking through you won't be you in your mind thinking what to say god will speak through and that person will come into liberty hallelujah so now we're living in the season it's not now is the time to speak silence has ended why is science ended because now we're not fighting a battle of well i have the skills i have the shame i have the sinner no that's been taken care of we've got to settle the mind battle and say no no the blood is enough in the church age book i think it's the philadelphian age you know brother abraham said that that that under that age that says they did not believe in the blood salvation is of the lord in reality they believed salvation was of the lord and their own good conduct that's come to an end it's not what it's not calvary plus you it's calvary only it's the power of the blood of the lamb only holy it's only him it's not me hallelujah it's not what he did that and now i've done this so i've earned something now here we go as i said it's not brownie points hallelujah no it's the power of his blood manifest the life that was in that blood comes into a people and then manifest a total victory hallelujah and so now so let's just tell the devil actually all the blame's on you before i became a believer even now all my faults and things i've done wrong that i've confessed actually it always on your head hallelujah and because it was him that's attributed to him now i can walk in confidence because it's the blood i have a lamb he's my advocate hallelujah he's my high priest he's my all in all well how can you have confidence and you know what about you no no i have confidence in him you know we will be able you know when we're gathered around the throne we're not going to have a testimony service saying well i did this i did this and i did this and this is what i did that won't be nowhere near the picture it will be it was all you lord you have brought me here you brought me here lord your blood you attributed your sacrifice to me and i accepted it you knew i'd be here you brought me here carlia will you say that's a rigged thing yes but then also whosoever will let them come it's our choice hallelujah but now we're living in a season that now it's time to speak the contents of the book amen that now liberty will be proclaimed through the mouths of sons and daughters of god that's why we should never never speak a negative thing sure he said well the devil's on my case but god's given me the victory i don't know how these people will be saved but lord we're believing they're going to be saved having the same faith that worked for me i now apply to them hallelujah amen so now friends this is the hour of the manifestation or the revealing of the sons of god and you happen to be in that number you say this is all pie in the sky no this is reality the things that once bothered us don't bother us no more we claim higher we we climb higher each day do we not you look back a year and say oh boy i can't believe i did those things thought those things yet you were saved in that condition but god is refining and lifting you higher hallelujah so now we can rejoice we're anointed to speak hallelujah it's amazing moses walks into egypt he says let there come fleece please come let there come frogs frogs come the nile's going to turn to blood he puts the staff or whatever happens it happens here's a man under the blood of bulls and goats raises staff in the red sea part so you know he's a man redeemed by just by the blood of bulls and goats and he comes in he gets what god has ordained him to get the people of israel and they're carried away that's just somewhat of the blood of bulls and goats his sin was just covered how about a people under the blood of jesus christ you say i don't need frogs or fleas or red seeds i know but we have other needs we have other things that the the devil that taskmaster has been holding hallelujah oh when someone else comes and we have these special meetings this happens no no what about you right now remember it's not an anointed ministry only it's not just inspired preaching inspired song leaders or musicians no this is the time of his anointed people uh with the anointing it's not just on the preacher it's on the people hallelujah it's not just big signs so it comes from overseas and does this and this will happen no no us right now you're the guy or you're the girl that god wants to use amen but if you just say if you just have a revelation i pray you do the blood is enough i do this there's blood for it i've failed here there's blood for it i've done this there's blood for it oh my guilt there's blood my shame this blood my
