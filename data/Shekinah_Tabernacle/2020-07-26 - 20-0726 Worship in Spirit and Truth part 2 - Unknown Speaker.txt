god bless you all thank you brother thank you musicians amen good morning everyone god bless you amen it's gonna we're gonna turn to the scripture um we're gonna go to daniel uh chapter 12 then we're going to go to ephesians if you just throw the slideshow up there hey man trust everyone's had a good week amen i mean it's good that's just decay here with us god bless you you're welcome and you

look right up there good okay so daniel 12 and 1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the people are children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that it shall be found written in the book amen lance book of life rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen and then we're just going to read down to verse 3 here and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament so they'll shine like the stars in heaven and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever amen let's go to ephesians chapter one very familiar piece of scripture to us all i'm sure i'm just going to read the first three verses maybe this must be child proof i can't use it oh no yes we'll come to him later ephesians 1 and from verses 1 down to verse 5 or verse 6 rather so paul an apostle if everyone's there of jesus christ by the will of god i like it pretty much every time he addresses the saints i'm an apostle by the will of god not my will it's it's god's will that i'm in this office and it's god's will that we are his bride today i mean to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ so not strife not not not not fear but grace and peace be to you blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us before him i mean in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love this is how he chose us this is how he wants us to be and if god wants us to be a certain way we're going to end up that way i mean having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved even everyone say i'm accepted in jesus christ today hallelujah amens let's just bow he's in a word of prayer shall we this morning lord jesus lord we are so glad lord and that is an understatement lord we are so so thankful lord to be to be your children lord to be called by you lord in this hour lord as we are approaching a time of a great trouble law that lord as we read about in daniel lord i just pray father that you would prepare our hearts lord we are we're lord it's not like we are in a slow motion car wreck lord jesus waiting for a great disaster to happen lord that's not our our our heart even though we see great troubles coming upon the earth but lord we're under great expectation because lord you're going to take a bride away lord you're going to take her in a rapture and lord we believe that we're part of that redeemed number lord when the redeemed of the lord are gathering in lord we were singing about what you've done in our lives lord we're so thankful we are your redeemed ones dear god i just pray you are anointed speaker and hear it one more time lord we have come to see you this morning lord have come to sit at your table lord we've come to the lord that you would come and change our hearts make us more like you lord we're so thankful lord it's it's it's we are your workmanship lord we're not man's workmanship lord we're not our own we're yours so father i pray you come and just live like never before lord jesus lord we just submit our lives into your hands be with those who couldn't make it as well lord be their portion father be be where they are oh god and we just love you so much we thank you for what you're doing in this time lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats today um i want to continue on where i was speaking last last week about worshiping him and spirit and truth but i just wanted to drop this in uh this morning now this is this is brother ronnie and um i've mentioned him over the years he was my translator there when the convention was there in garoka a couple of years ago and and it seems to be the lord is using him to share the message and people are coming out of denomination churches are coming out and they're coming into you know and and but he he called me i believe it was friday and he said he said him and his family went to a prayer meeting and when they came back their house had burned down um a car or something hit their house or something happened and the place burned down they lost everything um but he's not asking for sympathy he's just asking for prayer um this this weekend 30 odd people have have come to where he is to be baptized named lord jesus christ they they heard about this happening and they said you know should we uh should we not come you know because of this he said no no this is just the devil trying to upset god's program come anyway so they're being baptized and um mighty things are happening uh but that's why and then but then he said you know pray for me pray for us because there's a lot of people saying that he's bringing a false gospel and all those different things and that's why i have this scripture up here for a great door and effectual is open unto me but there are many adversaries so when the lord opens the door you know there's going to be trouble so keep him in his and his family in prayer uh up there in papua new guinea but there's literally i don't know how many people have have come come into the lord since since those you know that convention a couple of years ago and remember it's a body work so whenever one of us goes overseas to preach you're preaching right remember because we're all you know you know it's all the body work so uh everything he's doing is actually connected to to you here amen so anyways but but i put that in there because it's interesting because sometimes we think we have it hard but there's always someone who has it harder right but you know sometimes we just got to look beyond the natural you know you know he's got to maybe let's just stop or you just say we started well let's just stop you know we read in daniel that the wise will shine as the stars in heaven right during this time when there's going to be a time of great trouble upon the earth as it never has been never been you know as is being such a nation you know there'll be a time when thy people will be delivered every one that should be found written in the book but he says the wire shall shine as the brightness and the firmament and they shall turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever so there has to be a people that are wise in this day amen but but we know that the wisdom of god is not the wisdom of man it's not something learned it's not something you can earn as you know go to a school and get a degree and then get post graduate study and you know become a postdoc and then you begin you become a lecturer that's not how this works no this is this is a different kind of wisdom and the wisdom that we speak about is holy ghost wisdom and the only way to me a person can be wise is if they have oil in their lamps and their lamp is on fire amen if they have the holy ghost burning in their lives that's the only way people can be wise in this hour amen because even it says in in proverbs it says here and we'll jump back to that one but you know the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the of the holy is understanding so even the fear of thought is the beginning of wisdom so to me wisdom is when you receive the mind of christ which is the holy ghost coming and dwelling in your in your in your being right so so so the fear of the lord will start you on that journey i mean two you know it's the beginning it's the start of wisdom but it will should end you up that you actually have the lord living in your life i mean so there's a people now in this hour that will shine as the stars of the heaven now we know that god wrote his first bible up in the heaven right so every star is in a position and it's actually telling a story and it's the same thing amen with the people upon the earth because we know the heavenly host brother brown would speak about and i believe its greatest bad level fought that heavenly host should reflect should be a reflection of an earthly host right so as they are in their position they're telling a story they are actually speaking i mean the stars actually speak the plan of redemption i mean to to to the earth and it's amazing because if you look at um astronomy how the earth is actually in the best position in the milky way to actually observe the heavens god put it here that you could see the whole plan of redemption i mean if we were maybe in another galaxy somewhere we wouldn't see what we'd see we wouldn't see the zodiac as we should but god put us here that we could actually read the scripture i mean actually understand it and i'll say that's why god has put us here upon the earth that we can read the stars we can read the scripture and actually understand it amen and to see our position in it now now we have to understand that we're living in a day where this is a body work now when i when i spoke last sunday about the dynamics coming into the body i mean we know that not all of us are called to prophesy well we're not all called to speak in tongues and even to cast out devils you know there was you know brother brown um speaks about i think it was demus chicarian's wife or or or daughter and she would say you know i'd fast and pray i'd fast and pray and pray but i haven't cast out the devil yet and and brother baby now the reason is god calls you to fast and pray and then someone else casts the devil out right so so it's a body work so so whatever position you're called to be in the body i mean we're going to stand in that position well we can't all be deacons we can't all be song ladies we can't all sing like this we can't all play like this you know we're not all called to one position god is not a cookie cutter as brother on spencer says it just just smashes us into a mold and we come out the same way we're all built differently but we have to be comfortable in our own skin what god has called us to be i mean if i'm called to be a teacher let me teach with all my strengths if i'm a preacher if i'm an evangelist whatever i am you know i said to brother johnny demoff years ago i said it doesn't matter on the delivery of a sermon some people think you know the preacher's got to jump off the pulpit and do some assaults and then that god's really moving no no no it's not the delivery it's the power of the of the anointed word in a person's life so a teacher can say something and it can just be talking like this and it can deliver a person like this because that word is anointed right so it's all how the gift operates it's all god in different forms right but it's god speaking i mean so you know so we're all built differently some of us are prayer warriors some of us want to be prayer warriors right some of you know what i mean so but i mean so but that doesn't mean we shouldn't pray but whatever god leads you into irrespective of what your flesh wants god's moving you into a position so it's a body work amen now but now though if if if we have the holy ghost we truly do god will move us into that position but it actually has to be us now yielding ourselves to him you know this world is a world of a comfort zone you know this first world this first world you can tailor your world into such a way that you don't even need to leave your house virtually for anything right you can order everything online you can order food online people can come and fix your house you know you can order everything online you know you can have such a short little comfort zone but god doesn't want us in a comfort zone god wants us to walk with him wherever that is we're going to go beyond our comfort zone and what we're used to and just walk with god i mean and actually find the people that live the most fulfilling lives not just now now i'm not even talking about spiritually now i'm talking about naturally they get out of their comfort zone hallelujah and we know the thing is when you're when you're growing up like for example i was at boarding school so your whole life was dictated to you you had to get out of your comfort zone right you had to get up at a certain time even didn't matter if you're a morning person a night person you got up right you had to go to breakfast at a certain time didn't matter if you wanted breakfast not you you went you had to dress a certain way because you had to have uniform everything was you know this even after school everything you had to get out of your comfort zone and you're thrown into a boarding house with 70 boys you know from all different kind of you know uh backgrounds and age and everything oh boy you're you're out of your comfort zone and you couldn't really you know determine that no i want to sleep in this room and this no no no no no you got told you had to get out of your comfort zone right and those who just said okay i'm going to push out of this comfort zone i'm going to get into this thing they enjoyed it right for those who are not willing well it was pretty tough but anyway but the thing is when you're young you get kind of forced out of a comfort zone but then when you get older then you have more choice keep pushing it out keep pushing that comfort zone amen but because if we get too comfortable we can actually stop god from doing what he wants to do in our lives now now i want to now i think i i say this a lot but i you know i find having slides hard because um you know they never stay in the right order now we're going to come to that here we are see now notice abraham i'm going to come back to abraham later now i trust this all comes together in the end now what was it now god called abraham because he was a good man no god called abraham by election god elects people and over in the book of ephesians the first chapter about the fifth verse paul states that the word pre-de word predestinated us the adoption of sons that's the placing of people in the body of christ that means we're predestinated unto that position you know it's amazing you know people get birthed into the kingdom and god does a glorious thing heaven comes down and glory fills their soul and then we can bring it to wonder am i going to make it to my adoption of course you're going to make it to your adoption because the word called you i mean to a birth it's going to take you to your place hallelujah now paul states and many times many of us are actually adopted in the body and we don't realize it amen brother bam says about a housewife being an adopted part of the body hallelujah remember when you're in your position that's power hallelujah you're in your land you're in your inheritance and woe to any devil that comes upon it hallelujah because amen you know where you are and about the so now that doesn't mean that god just puts you in a little channel and runs you through and you can't help how you go right then there would be no reward but god gives you the free moral agency to make your choice but god will keep his believer that means that god just doesn't force you through a pipe and then you'll be on the other side rejoicing no no no you've got to give yourself over you're going to surrender yourself to the will of god for your life hallelujah basis but god will keep us believer i mean so so we have to keep that in in perspective now the wise will the wise have the holy ghost the mind let this mind mindless in christ be in you and this is the age where the mind of christ is definitely in a people now here here here's a picture picture you know you know there's a thousand words or whatever here's the wise and here's the foolish now we're living in this era and and you can see there's some here and they know they have no oil one's just pouring the oil in and it's going to be lit others this one's saying sorry you got to go by we're going this way you know go by you know and but but these ones are wise these are the wise ones because they have oil in their vessel hallelujah and so now they know what to do with the word in their day hallelujah these ones are just going along for the ride and and i just want to maybe you know don't just go along for the ride don't just come to church for the ride don't just be a believer just for the ride and everyone else is doing it this is my circle and you know no no we want to have an individual walk right we want to know him in the power of his resurrection as a reality in this day amen hallelujah i pray god help us this hour you know this is this is incredible where where god would actually put his mind in a people i mean anything and those people would see the world through the eyes as god would see them right so so they would think about things as god would think about them their heart would be god's heart holly they would they would treat others as god would treat others incredible thing really when you take people you know it says in the scripture not one man seeketh after god we're actually built not we're actually physically built not to look after him i mean i mean look look look after him seek him right but there's something that goes beyond that beyond this that's down in the soul and god begins to call that person harley and i don't know where you were but i was in a dark place but then a light came this message came my way i mean heaven came down and glory filled my soul hallelujah amen you know and now our lives are no longer the same amen amen yeah it was amazing i was talking to the girls last night about martin luther and martin luther you know you know i may have may may kind of condense the story real real down but he was a catholic priest and he sincerely wanted to serve god and he did all the things catholics did and you know tried and he tried and he just failed but then i think one of his superiors gave him a bible and he was reading the book of romans and he came to the place where he said the just shall live by faith and that little few words changed his life and change actually the course of history i mean we're just the just shall live by faith hallelujah he read that and it's like a whole weight came off him and he realized it's not my my work serving a man-made system that that that saves me but my faith in jesus christ i'm justified by my faith and and a big weight of sin fell off his shoulders and he was freed by just by one scripture hallelujah and the whole world was changed by it hallelujah now and you know i was telling them i said now if one scripture can do that for someone what about a whole book what about every promise of god if one can change the world what about the whole book what could it do hallelujah amen but the wise recognize what they have hallelujah but isn't that you know i i think it impacted me that more impacted them i was thinking about that just it's just the just shall live by faith if i can count six words change his life and then john weasley after he he i think he failed in england i mean i mean i mean america came back to england and and and and they had a group there and someone was reading uh martin luther's um commentary on the book of romans it says like a warming just filled his heart hallelujah change the world again amen there's a power in faith hallelujah faith we have will change our bodies i mean remember the word gives you rapturing faith hallelujah so the wise now there's a people upon the earth that can actually walk in this world and they're not caught up in this world you know this might come out wrong but i've been thinking about it you know there's people around the world tearing down statues because your people are you know confronting the past now to me they're tearing down the wrong statues okay well what do you mean is it because the people they're tearing down no no no there are statues you know a statue is a monument based on a historical event right and that country rallies around history now you can take a statue and people glorifying things but there's other kind of statues that need to be torn down and they are statues that are in people's hearts they are monuments to things in the past i mean that people carry around in their hearts right pain i mean traumatic events in their life i mean bitterness maybe their their their their parents hurt them and now they're carrying the statue around and their whole life is being dictated to by a history that's the kind of statues that need to be torn down i mean their hearts has changed hardly they were no longer living by things in the past are you following me you know i don't agree with all the statues and whatever they do that's them but you know we can't walk around living in the past amen hallelujah that's the kind of statues your indifference unbelief i mean whatever the devil puts in someone's life that appears to be so important tear it down let god let god tear it down today well you know some people are just so caught up in you know physical needs and you know things and but there's people like this that they lose everything they just keep walking with god i mean they're not worried about it he doesn't have he can't go to the government and get a you know go on the dole and things he's up in his 50s at least you know but he's got children he's got to look after he says no no just pray for us this word's going forth people are coming to the lord hallelujah i say i say that's a wise man man because the devil will try and throw us off the road with everything he can i mean but the wise will continue on the road hallelujah amen so i hope that came out right but you know you know people you rewrite history but it doesn't convert anyone it doesn't take them to heaven i'm interested in people going to heaven that's my agenda i don't have any other kind of agenda i want to see i want to see all of us around the throne that's what i want to see all the same age rejoicing hallelujah we made it hallelujah we can shake each other by the hand and say we made it god got us here hallelujah hallelujah you know we can sit down and reminisce for a thousand years and then another thousand years and we go up go up into the great city and sit at his feet i don't know how it's going to be but it's going to be good you know what i mean hallelujah glory to god so there's the people that will come to their position in this day and god will get us there now brother brahmi says he says this and he and he mentions this all the way through through his ministry we'll come back to that this isn't uh the identified christ of all ages and the word is a thought made manifest you think you think it then speak it like i say the light i had to think light before i said light microphone i have to say or think microphone before i say to say microphone and we are god's attributes displayed so we are god's attributes his thoughts made flesh he thought of us he spoke us and here we are amen right hallelujah but notice what he goes into after he he says this and i find out i find two classes of people as it goes along so there's after the seals are open this is after the words come open you know all those but but he mentions this all the way through his ministry and i find out i find two classes of people as it goes along one of them is the fundamentalists and on and the other one is the pentecostals now the pentecostals got something but they don't know who they are right and the fundamentalists know something but it ain't got nothing with it so now there it's just like a man having money in the bank and can't write a check the other one can write a check got no money in the bank if you could ever get that thing together it would be a great thing right to those who love to spend but have nothing to spend and those who have everything to spend but can't spend it so there's the stingy who won't spend it those are the fundamentalists right there's the pentecostals who who want to spend everything but they've got nothing to spend he says if we can ever get these two together it will be a great thing now now to me this is just my mind you're being able to read that kind of thing you think how can we get these two together don't we we say how can we join these two because you know we always find these two classes of people and they're all the way down to 2020. right and this is not the peanut cut this is not out there this is in in the realm of the bride of christ amen but now the only way that they will come together as god puts them together right that that god would send a word into our agent he has that will actually make a people that have all the money in the bank they recognize that their bank is the bank of heaven it's not the bank of new zealand it's not it's not the federal reserve whatever it's the bank of heaven right and they have a checkbook where the lord jesus put his name signed in the blood of jesus christ it says ask what you will and it shall be done hallelujah so it's those kind of people that will will will be manifested in this end time so now if we can just find this here brother abraham says this now like israel this is the feast of the trumpets i believe like israel back in her promised land sorry there wasn't any espanol for this for this message um she don't know how she got back there she just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride right as the power of god will put the people in the bride now you just take that little thought there and you run it through the scripture what put caleb on his mountain the power of god right wasn't because he was different to any of the other israelites no the power of god moved on his heart he says give me this mountain doesn't matter about the scars remember he could have had a lot of statues in his heart of being a slave but those were actually pulled down and all that was put in as hard as i have a promise i have a position in the word and i'm here to fulfill that position hallelujah says give me my mountain i mean so the power of god actually put him in his pl position i mean the power of god put david on the throne hallelujah it wasn't david's ability that put him on the throne it wasn't david's ability that killed the lion and killed the bear and killed goliath that was the anointing of god hallelujah to put him on the throne amen and we can go through even the apostles you know we go through the prophet of god's life we can go through our lives as the power of god will put us into the bride of christ but i really want to say it that we are there right we are there amen now don't look at me mr fundamentalist and say i know that but you got nothing in the bank or you know or or mr pentecostal uh well i don't know that but i got all this money just i got all this faith right you know you're going to say no you've got to recognize where are we who are we not who are we becoming who are we remember when when when when when moses looked out on the um you know um israelites are slaves in egypt he saw the children of god he saw god's son and then god said out of egypt i've called my son they they were knee-deep or whatever deep in mud and they were making bricks and all that stuff and god said this is my heritage this is my children they'll not become my children because they cross the border from egypt into the promised land that does not make them my children they already were by birth they were living under a promise right they are living under a promise that god said you're going to come and dwell in the promised land hallelujah so they were already sons of god sons and daughters of god they already were right and then god had to call them amen and those who responded to the call said yes i'm coming holy yes i'm coming and and and they had to realize i do not become a son i already was a son but because the word became alive and me i mean that's that's actually god making you recognize you're a son and daughter of god right it's really us that our eyes need to come open that's why that's why god pours the spirit out service after service you pray and god comes down he changes your life and he quickens his word to your heart and you and you realize i'm not from this world i'm not from a church and from heaven that's god trying to get your attention you're my child you're my son you're my daughter that's why that's why my word has an effect in your life because you are my child hallelujah so now if we are as children i have a checkbook from the bank of heaven remember it's not it's not what i consider me to be it's what god says i am holier caleb could have still been drenched in mud saying i want my mountain you know he said hold on you're not ready no no i was born ready remember david was carrying food down to his brothers and the badly just heard you know goliath his boss fell on the wrong ears that day bring me a man something in him said david said hold on where's that coming from that guy that guy right there you know he was just serving his dad and all that stuff then you know he wasn't like i'm gonna kill a giant today when he woke up i'm gonna you know how should i stand when i kill this you know he wasn't he wasn't planning nothing he's just he's just serving in the body you just serve in the body of christ and when the devil comes your way hallelujah you know you don't have to plan it it'll just happen but then when the devil comes your way hallelujah he came to the wrong person i remember we're a predestinated people amen that every devil will be under our feet and brother ham said eve was ordained to fall but this bride is ordained that she cannot fall i mean she cannot fall to the deception of the devil ah but i'm sick i have this need i have this need to know but are you walking in faith are you walking in faith hallelujah because it's the biggest challenge has always been through the ages will they take god at his word or will they take what the devil says right and and that's always the battle but we have but i believe i have to be looking at a people that say i just i just believe this something in me says it's true it's for me it's not for the future it's for now hallelujah this word is yan amen i don't know how it's going to be fulfilled that's not my business that's god's business hallelujah do you think do you think mary had to go and become a doctor i mean and and and work out how wombs work and all that thing you know you know to become pregnant she didn't run down to the local hospital and say now tell me how how do the birds and the bees and show me all you know how does that all work she didn't have to work that out she just took god at his word hallelujah and that you know and it was god's it was god's responsibility to bring it to pass amen now where are we yes but the power of god will put the people in the bride and we should be able to say amen that's happened it put me in the bride hallelujah god's power did remember it's not him that willeth or runneth but to god child's mercy and he hath he showed me a lot of mercy hallelujah amen but his spirit put me in the bride the power of god amen will put the people to the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ now when you think about now no this is me and maybe i'm anyway but when you read about you know read those kind of words she'll recognize her position sometimes it can put a pressure on people now i've got to work it out you know that we have to mentally work it out and you know you know it's kind of like a maths question at school you got to open these brackets and do this and integrate and differentiate and you know all those things some of us know what that is and some of us are happy we're forgotten you know but it's not something you know it's not something we have to mentally work out remember the god of the bible reveals himself you just this is the pattern of the bible god before the beginning had a burden i want a family i want to have relate i want to have a relationship with people and they'll love me and i'll love them and i'll prove my love to them and they'll respond and love me back so he made this universe he made this earth he put adam and eve upon upon this earth he began to reveal himself to them and then the devil comes in you know as soon as i'm not sure what that means okay i thought i was getting signals but i was never in the army anyway you know and then and then and then sin came in and and god's masterpiece was mad but god cannot be defeated so he begins to rebuild and then down through the scripture because it's remember it's god's burden i want to have relationship i want to know people i want people to know me i want to love people and people love me you know as a response this is god's heart all the way through the scripture so he came to enoch enoch loved him he walked with god yeah enoch didn't wake up one day saying i'm going to walk with god i'm 65 years old you know and i'm going to walk with him 300 years then he's going to take me in a rapture no no he was doing whatever he was doing and then and then god came to him and god began to call him and he responded to the call and and then he began to walk and then one day he got so far up up the ladder god said you just want to keep coming yes hallelujah how could you say no to that kind of call you know so it was god calling and enoch responding right moses tried to moses knew he was a son of promise he knew he was the serpent bruiser right that was going to deliver israel out of the hand of the egyptians he knew he was ordained for that job but when he tried to figure it out he killed one guy and that was it and and and he ran away as a runaway prophet because he failed but then because why he was trying to act before god revealed himself amen and then now suddenly he's he's 80 years old he's basically forgotten maybe the call and he's looking after his father-in-law's sheep and then the bush is on fire god wanted relationship he's my son he's been on the run he's been there for 80 years and i mean yo he's now 80 years old yo i want a relationship with him and he comes down the burning bush he speaks and moses responds hallelujah joshua lived an incredible life he was with moses many times when god came down amen incredible things he saw but he had to meet that same god for himself hallelujah and then now here comes heck you know he they're about to cross jordan you know or maybe they had already by that stage you guys should know the detail you barber readers yep and then the captain of the host came down and he and he just saw him as a regular looking man with a sword because he's the euphoria against us he said no no i'm not for you and i'm not against you i've come to take over your battle right and then so joshua responded to how god revealed himself so he realized now this is not me going to lead this campaign but god has come down to take over this campaign i mean that he will lead us in the battle and it's the same thing with you and i i mean it's not that if jesus is on our side but if we are we on jesus side hallelujah that's the key amen so now here here he is he just lays himself at the feet of the captain and then that captain leads him all the way through why because god wanted relationship amen hallelujah and you come down to a library you go down all through the scripture yes it's the same thing isaiah is there in the temple he just had a big big big heartache in his life because the king that he loved so much and he leaned upon his shoulder so much now became a leper and it was in the year that he died he's in distress and he's in the temple praying to god saying god what's going on and then and then he sees the lord high and lifted up he saw a vision of god high above with his train filled the temple and and the burden that he went in with i think it left him because he was he was god saying i want relationship with my son amen but he's leaning too much on the shoulder of this king so i've got to take this earthly influence away i mean that i can reveal himself to my son and god has to do that sometimes hallelujah abraham wanted to bring all of his family worth when god called him that's an individual walk amen he had to be willing just to walk with god amen anyway and then and then and then god speaks to isaiah because why god wanted a relationship with isaiah i'm repeating this because this is this is all the way down through the old testament god reveals himself and the people respond to him hallelujah and they take god at his word and they act upon it now that is the god of the bible because you see the same thing in the new testament god has manifested in flesh and jesus christ and he goes by the way of peter james and john come follow me and then god began to reveal himself to to the apostles and they responded to that call and then finally there's the um you know yo the apostle paul on the road to damascus he's going to tear this thing up he's sick of this all this fanatics and all this crazy stuff going on you know he's going to put an end to this but then the god of the old testament which was jesus christ came and revealed himself to the apostle paul on the road to damascus and what apollo he responded who are you lord i am jesus whom you persecute oh boy imagine having a real shaving down oh boy but but he had to have that experience then he began to know the grace of god and begin to know god in the power of his resurrection he didn't know that beforehand i mean but he knew it then and that same god is the same god today right the same god that reveals himself then is the same god the reveal reveals himself in the same way today he sends his word hallelujah amen he manifests himself and we see that manifestation and we respond to him hallelujah and we take him at his word and then he begins to fulfill that word in our lives remember he hasn't called us just to make us religious he hasn't called us just to have a church no he's called us remember we're under a a specific message and that message is going to do a specific thing what's it going to do change our bodies remember that's the reason that it came it's not just no your you know that with no mystery so that is good but it came to change our bodies i mean to bring the dead in christ from the grave hallelujah and to change our mortal bodies that's the point of the whole message hallelujah that god would be god would express his love to a people and those people would love him out of their free choice back with all their lives in their hearts amen hallelujah amen so now his word his spirit my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place so now he's saying that god's word this message is going to put a people in their place that they have all the money in the bank and they have all the checks hallelujah you know it used to be i i think checks are being phased out nowadays i think you know you know it's like a what we call a floppy disk you know there was a couple of years ago my old job we found some and some of the older colleagues took them to the younger ones than me said you know what this is and they had to think real real hard is it a save icon you know what is it now we used to save stuff on this how many gig can you fit gig what are you doing you know but you know what i mean i mean so so it's like a checkbook many of us don't know what checkbooks are but there comes a time when the checkbook runs out you've got to get a new one because you use all your checks god's checkbook isn't that way it never runs out of pages hallelujah so his so there'll be a people that will be put in their place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ now what does it mean to recognize our position in the word it's to recognize who we are in the lord right we you know what are we this is a very probably very ver well we are christians we are you know but what are we we are prophecy made manifest this is what the bride is prophecy made manifest well what is prophecy god's thoughts being spoken upon the earth when he said let there be light he thought about it he spoke it it became material right when he said i'm gonna have a bride without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb rejoice because the marriage of the lamb has come right what was that that was he thought it yeah and then he spoke it now it has to become material amen no but when he thought about that yo the marriage of the lamb has come it wasn't just a blanket audition though it is for everyone if they will accept it right because it's to whomsoever we'll let them come right we know that but when god thought about that he thought about every single bride member amen where they came from their age how tall how fat how thin how much hair how little here our bigger eyebrows are our nose out whatever he knew everything about us our family our forebears their problems our parents problems our problems he knew all about it glory he knew where would be you know what color would be whatever he knew all the detail of all of those bride members yes right amen didn't he because he he's not a finite god you know it's not like we kind of some you know like you build a house and you and you look at the plans and you have an idea of what it'll look like but you don't really know what it'll look like until it's built god ain't that way he has the full image in his mind because his thoughts are different to us right so so when he said let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the you know the marriage of the lamb has come revelations 19 and his wife has made herself ready he knew exactly are you all following me i trust this means something to you because you actually realize i'm a fulfillment of prophecy i'm a fulfillment of revelations 19. hallelujah where where god thought of it just like when he when he spoke to abraham and said your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land remember you know i heard brother john andy say it you could probably know where i'm going with a lot of things i say but let it minister to you i mean don't don't don't let it become a predictable outcome though it might be but just just just enjoy the ride and let it minister i mean so so so abraham was told by god your seat is going to sojourn in a strange land 400 years i'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand in his mind he knew moses moses was in that prophecy caleb was in that prophecy miriam was in that prophecy aaron was in that prophecy korra even day through that prophecy all of them were in there because he knew the trouble they'd faced he knew the hardship they had faced but yet in spite of that he knew that that end up without end up hallelujah just now now what are we our position in the word is that we are we are the word made manifest we are prophecy fulfilled remember god interprets his word by bringing it to pass amen where where you know isaiah spoke for the virgin shall conceive right and no doubt everyone in israel that believed isaiah was a prophet would say well how's that going to happen and they'll try and work it out but when mary received the visitation of the angel and she said and she said let it be unto me according to thy word did there was no debate it was interpreted right because it was fulfilled amen and now here we are god has called us out who's been called who's been called who's received faith to believe what jesus did on calvary who's been washed the things you once said you can't do because your nature's been changed right who's been given an overcoming life you know the bible says in mark 16 and my name thou shall cast out devils well there to come a time where you cast the devil out of your own life where he once led you but you said satan get away in the name of jesus christ i accept the cross and there's a change in your life what happened you just dethroned the devil out of your own life i mean and god came in how there's the supernatural work [Applause] hallelujah so who's been saved who's been sealed by the holy ghost remember god has his mind i'm gonna have a bride without spite or wrinkle or any such thing amen when you're on brother bram said she'll be born of his bone life is life flesh is flesh she is him amen shares him in feminine form hallelujah upon the earth when god was speaking those things it wasn't just to excite people god was announcing this is how she will be she and the bridegroom will become one hallelujah you know when jesus was jesus was was having the last supper with his disciples and he would pick up the pick up the cup which would not be this at all i'm just using it illustrator he said this is the new testament in my blood drink this as off as you remember me so in him was the new testament in him because he is he he was the whole word made flesh so in him was this more than ink on paper now but i'm just using it as an example in him was the gospels in him was the apostles coming to their position in in in him you could say was timothy right in him was the apostle paul's ministry in him was john receiving amen the book of revelation in him was the seven church age messengers men because they're the word right they are fulfillment of the word because it's very easy for us to you know go through the book of revelation and say well the first messenger was paul because it's history it's easy to look back and say of course he fulfilled that because brother brown's criteria was the ministry that was the most would that brought people back to the word the most it was the most spirit-filled that was the one that influenced the age the most that was the church age messenger so it's very easy to go of course it was irenaeus of course you know of course it was martin of course it was columba of course it was luther of course it was wesley and you know it's very because it's history of course it was brother bram you even read church history says that he initiated his ministry initiated the post-world war ii healing revival it's easy to god's history but remember all that when he said this is the new testament in my blood because they were the fulfillment they were in him they had to be expressed and so it's very easy now to say oh of course it's them but then we would look at that and say well this is the f but many times the fulfillment and what we think the fulfillment should be doesn't reconcile you take you take martin luther for a second he smoke smoke a pipe drank beer you know didn't believe that the jews were god's chosen people but yet he was the church messenger because that was god beginning to restore that little bit of truth came forth the just shall live by faith right so we say how could this reconcile it did because that was god's fulfillment you follow me and then now now let's just jump way up to where we are she'll be bone of his bone life of his life flesh of his flesh and and we're actually not saying when are these people going to turn up they're here are you following me they're here well who are they yes hello good morning hello good morning mrs jesus christ how are we today but the fulfillment and the reality i mean sorry the fulfillment and what we think the fulfillment should be many times it's like this pole or opposite but god called you right the reason you've responded to him in this day is proof to me that you're part of this word right it's not actually oh are these people gonna match it no no god ordains the people that will fulfill his word hallelujah amen amen so so we have to actually look and say hold on okay let's just stop here how can you say the bride has been called it's very simple jesus says when you see the fig tree put forth its buds and all the trees you know that the summer is knifing at the door so the millennium is going to be here israel's been in the nation how long class could do some quick math anyone this is the interactive part of the service i don't have the answer in front of me you could say anything about 70 years 1948 they became a nation okay so that generation that sees them become a nation shall not pass until all things be fulfilled okay we see sin how it is we see all that god we see the tears come to their maturity but remember what about the wheat now it's not just them coming mature and we're still on the ground trying to put our heads up a bit you know try and grow but no no no they both grow together hallelujah so based on that i can say she is here right there's a people upon the earth that are bone of his bone life is life fleshless she is him she is the word made flesh not she will be she is amen we have to you know sometimes we've got to really take stock lord you called me you've saved me you put something in my heart to respond to the call i see you changing my life as i walk with you hallelujah and then and then what was the purpose of the call the purpose of the call isn't that we'd go into a tribulation we're not preppers right you know we're not preppers where are we let's go oh boy we'll get there we're not preppers like these ones with the oil in their lamps they weren't preppers they were waiting for a call they had oil in their lamps you know they were waiting though already they're under expectation they were prepping for the right thing they are preparing to leave this world i mean the treasures were in heaven where the bridegroom was they are waiting for his call and they are ready as soon as the call said behold behold the bridegroom comes i've got oil i'm ready hallelujah these ones not so much we don't want to be in that category of people we want to be in this category of people hallelujah should be a burning desire lord i want oil i want the holy ghost of my life amen so but we're not prepping to stay here we're preparing to leave does that mean i just quit my job quit my education no no continue on yep continue on i want to build buy a house one day continue on i want to have grandkids continue on whatever you know i want to see my children grow up get married continue on it could be then it could be now god knows but we're gonna we're gonna play a long game but play the short game too what does that mean play a long game like it might be the next generation god comes but we're gonna play a short game like it could be right now that's how we're going to live amen amen so she is bone of his bone life is life flesh of his flesh she is him now it's when when when a people recognize their position in the word amen so we have to i trust recognize now god is going to bring us our god will cause us to recognize we have all the money in the bank we have checkbook authority right amen we have the right to ask anything in my name and he'll do it amen and we pray only according to his will no no no selfish ambition lord what would you have done what do you want in this situation hallelujah don't you just want to see his will fulfilled in your life amen now let's just let's just jump through this okay i might have to skip a few of this now it's amazing when brother brown speaks of we'll come to this another time he speaks about abraham here and this isn't the greatest bad i've ever fought he says abraham said get your bonnets and everything together we're taking off to the land where are you going i don't know amen but we're going anyhow here we go packed up and going hallelujah that's the real word of god what was he holding in front of him the promise of god the word of god we're going to have it amen amen and and that should be how we should be we're going to have it amen we're anointed to win amen amen doesn't mean there won't be a battle but we're anointed to win we're not anointed to lose amen we're anointed to win hallelujah amen so abraham had that kind of faith he says now come out from amongst your people abraham they're the thing uh of it is their doubters and unbelievers and they'll have you in the same fix come out come on out separate yourself and live for me what is it now many times and and maybe i should have put this together in a more clever way but it's i i can't read spanish i can't divvy it out but you know many times when people hear this kind of thing separate your people you separate yourself they think i've got to separate from all my worldly associates all of those unbelievers and doubters but he's not saying that here he says leave all of your conscience yes and senses behind like that right open up your mind and remember it's me come live with me i mean so so lay aside your memory as i said about pulling statues down pull down the right statues i mean pull down all the negative memories all the pain all the hurt let's go beyond those things today let's go beyond the hurt let's go beyond the pain let's go beyond the memory hello we can't do it amen we're called to keep moving forward amen so separate yourself from those things separate yourself from your disappointments hallelujah amen hearing disappointments we so often sadly roam do we not sing that and everyone rejoices in praise of the lord and glory i love that song because we're looking for a city but hearing disappointments we so often sadly rome it's all part of the walk remember god just doesn't put us through a channel and just push us through and we're good amen but he will keep his people amen he says god's calling every seed of abraham this morning to that same kind of a life great battles are now worldwide god wants us children separating themselves from what see taste feel smell here imaginations conscience memories reasons affections everything open up their mind that every word come in and march with that with the word that's a real soldier this is the great battle well my mind tells me one thing but what does god's word tell me my feelings say one thing you know many well why don't people go want to go beyond their comfort zone because they feel uncomfortable and they let that uncomfortable feeling override maybe they know they've got to do it but they don't do it i've got to do it but i feel uncomfortable we're going to push past it amen you know so he says separate from all those things open up their mind that every word come in and march with the word that's a real soldier amen that's what we're called to that's what we're called to be in this hour take god's word first above our feelings amen above our emotions above our memory above our conscience whatever it may be our imaginations let's lay that remember the apostle paul said cast down reasoning well what's the reasoning we should cast down is the word true or not is the word for me or not that's the reasoning isn't it really it's not reasoning about moral things or whatever no it's reasoning is it is the word true yeah it's easy to say it's true but what about is it for me oh boy that's when reason can really come in am i worthy to receive this promise yes what do you mean of course i'm worthy he died for me that i'd receive it amen amen hallelujah we don't want to this is the life we we we really want to walk in and if he says if every if he says that god is calling every seed of abraham this morning to for that same kind of a life this is what the wise will walk like yes oh can i do it of course you can do it amen what what do you mean he will enable us he has enabled us to do it amen remember god doesn't say go on a rapture and then just leave you to work it out right you know this is not trying to get to the moon in our own ability we call specialists together we build prototypes and whatever no no god just says i'm going to give you astronaut faith i'm going to give you a power to go through the stratosphere into another realm hallelujah i'm going to equip you that way hallelujah and so you know if god says this is how you got to be i'd say amen yes lord amen yes lord amen hallelujah amen amen sees us here maybe we'll stop see the new birth as a as christ as a revelation as christ mystery god revealed god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth that's what and what are you going to do when you get all that group together where revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest now a lot of people take this and say now we've got to get all the doctrine straightened out and we've got to have some right humanly speaking god will get the doctrine straightened out right as we walk with him but what is the revelation i mean that that that he is also talking about here right that christ has revealed himself personally to a person right are you with me harley says now what are you going to do when that revelation where the revelation is perfectly in harmony amen and god is expressing it through his word by the same actions you know we know the truth is if we really have the holy ghost when the correct doctrine comes away we'll accept it amen why because the mind of christ is in us hallelujah so it won't be a battle and we'll be able to lay aside you know scarecrows are the biggest problem but scarecrows are there because there's food right you don't put just say if i had a veggie garden i'm not gonna put a scarecrow by my litter box where there's nothing growing to keep the whatever's away from you know because all of my food is up you know i'm going to put a scarecrow where the food is you know if the bugs or whatever afraid of a scarecrow by the letterbox well they're gonna die anyway because they're dumb bugs right but you know a scarecrow is where food is yes so we should never be worried like i should be able to say thunders i should be able to speak about perugia right i should be able to speak about son of man ministry some of you look at me like what are you talking about because you haven't lived through those days right i should be able to talk about the seals open the books open the mighty angels here you know anything that oh that's controversial oh you know the lord's going to ride a trail i'll ride this trail again return ministry what is return ministry the holy ghost returning in his people it's not brother brown coming back and returning right so but we should be able to speak about these things doesn't matter what everyone else has done with it i mean what god allows scarecrows to rise up and people to fail because it's the genuineness of our faith will be tried right church splits god allows it to happen god allows conflict between ministries god allows laity to have fights all these different things why it's because the genuineness of our faith would be tried is our faith a genuine faith in him or is our faith in while everyone else is going in it's exciting right that's the challenge see so but if we have the mind of christ it doesn't matter what everyone's doing let them do it i said god help them yeah god help us as well but you know let's just walk with the lord abraham had to walk with god he had a burden why are you going this way but god called abraham god brought a lot out before the burning yes so i'm not diminishing lot right but we've got to walk with god alone it's me and jesus i'm going all the way hallelujah that's how we're all going to be you know our walk with god is not based on shekinah tabernacle we don't have a relationship with jesus christ through this this thing it's got to be individual i mean that that if there's no more church there's no more whatever we still walk with him but god allows all those things that the genuineness of our faith would be tried is it genuine faith or is it mixed with humanity and this is what the group's doing this is what these ones do or is actually i'm walking with him amen oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when pardon me it knows what it is yes and that's why i was speaking before about jesus said this is the new testament in my blood do this is off as you remember me he's saying actually it's in me it's just got to be expressed upon the earth what are we today now this is not this shouldn't be some abstract idea that's just exciting you should have you see no no i've been called abraham was just like any other man i'm gonna quit with this he's just like any other man but god spoke to him amen and he just began to walk with god and then he found himself in this land right and then god said i'm going to give you a son he found himself he had the son who who gave him the son god gave him the son and then when god said okay take that son and gonna sacrifice him well abraham said well i received his as one from the dead so god can raise him up again and then he found himself so it was just because of a supernatural call and then he found himself burying his wife sarah in a cave that he bought in a in that place he just found himself doing these things and then sarah's buried there then eventually abraham's buried there just found himself living this life and when he passed from this world to the next world he just happened to find himself in paradise he just all because of a call see see many times you know we look at what god has done in the scripture and we think that's incredible and it's incredible but he will believe as though just living up their everyday life abraham had his good harvest he had his bad harvest he had trouble and whatever more and strife and trouble in the family all these things but god called abraham right and he just found himself walking with god and then he found himself in paradise hallelujah and then adam and eve and all the redeemed came and embraced them and they rejoiced and you know but it was just and then finally here they are and then more of the redeemed come through and then isaac came through hallelujah and isaac would tell abraham about his journey with the lord and you know jacob and all the different ones and david they came through and then eventually the thief on the cross came through how long was your earthly journey with the lord about five minutes god ordained i know i've said it before but god ordained him for that five minutes right it's not about oh i wish he you know sure we all wish we we you know we met him earlier but god ordained him to know the lord five minutes that was the part of the word he had to fulfill glory right there had to be a thief that was pardoned and a thief not pardoned just like the butler and the baker there in joseph's prison that had to be fulfilled in reality hallelujah so now they're all in paradise and then finally you know they're rejoicing and then finally the one that they were waiting for walks through the door and then he says come on boys we're going up higher yeah i'm just i'm just giving a very brief overview and they ascend up on high into the great city and if you asked abraham abraham why are you in that city because he called me down there amen and something in me said that's god the world was full of religion in that day too but something in him said that's the one who made this made all things something in him said i can serve a god like that hallelujah and he just found himself walking amen and then he ends up in glory and here we are amen and god called us yes did god has he called you does he become real he called you for a reason he doesn't lead you just down some garden path and whatever more and just down to a dead end no no he leads you into a new body hallelujah why are you saying all this we'll get there suspense i planned it why are you saying all this because it keeps us in perspective it keeps everything in perspective right it doesn't matter about what happens in life i didn't get into it but it says in daniel here that the that that michael will stand up that great prince you stand up for the children of the people so there's now daniel is told michael the great prince is going to stand up for the children of thy people it's not just going to be them trying to sort it out god's going to come down i mean angelic forces to come down from heaven and we're going to look after the children of thy people and it's the same thing with the bride of jesus christ i mean we are the most looked after people i mean in the whole of existence we are never out of his care it doesn't matter how bad things look or whatever we're never out of his care hallelujah god is on the scene hallelujah for us amen and we must never ever let that leave our minds doesn't matter if you feel him if you don't feel them that's irrelevant hallelujah god is present amen the god that called you as the god will take you all the way up into glory and we must never forget it amen hallelujah what if things go sideways praise god we lose everything glory amen we're never out of his care amen hello can we have the musicians can you can you come forward this morning amen the wise will shine like the stars in heaven hallelujah
