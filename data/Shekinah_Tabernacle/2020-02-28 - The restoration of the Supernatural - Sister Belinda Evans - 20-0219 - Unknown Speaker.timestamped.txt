[0:04] um I just like to thank the Lord and
[0:08] just give a little testimony about some
[0:11] day and I just it was about five or ten
[0:15] minutes and through the service and I
[0:17] just started crying I couldn't stop I
[0:19] didn't know what was going on and and
[0:22] then we had the word coming and the Lord
[0:25] just hitting so many things you know and
[0:27] in there and it was just beautiful
[0:29] and then we had the prayer line
[0:31] happening and I heard brother Ben say
[0:33] some of you will have mine barrels of it
[0:36] you know and I didn't go up to the front
[0:38] to be prayed for but I also know the
[0:40] prophecies that Lord can even meet you
[0:43] in your seat and sort of the woman that
[0:46] they touched the hem of Jesus garment
[0:48] you know he met her right there and for
[0:52] me I've never experienced anything like
[0:55] that I just stood there just worshiping
[0:58] the Lord and just praising him it was
[1:00] like I felt like a hand just touch me on
[1:03] my heart and just this was just from
[1:06] here just down the side here and it's
[1:09] been over two years where I had just had
[1:11] struggles with my heart and it was like
[1:14] a spiritual wound and I believe the Lord
[1:17] made me here that day and I just want to
[1:20] give him all the things the praises for
[1:22] his deliverance and this song this song
[1:27] here is called the restoration of the
[1:29] supernatural and thank you and that I
[1:34] wrote it in 2011 our pastor preached
[1:37] about that and then it took me five
[1:40] years to complete it because the second
[1:42] part was missing but it's where the
[1:45] Prophet when that interpretation came
[1:48] about it French French people that
[1:50] interpret it in the cafe and he said
[1:53] because you have chosen the narrow path
[1:55] the hard way and you have not walked in
[1:59] your own choosing you have picked the
[2:01] correct and precise decision and it is
[2:04] my way because this momentous decision a
[2:07] huge portion of heaven will await thee
[2:11] what a glorious
[2:13] you have made this in itself is that
[2:16] which will give and may come to pass the
[2:19] tremendous victory in the love divine
[2:22] it's a promise to us
[2:34] [Music]
[4:45] every
[4:46] [Music]
[4:51] there's no
[4:55] as well
[5:04] [Music]
[5:32] I will
[5:33] [Music]
[5:58] the natural
[6:04] for the supernatural
[6:10] [Applause]
