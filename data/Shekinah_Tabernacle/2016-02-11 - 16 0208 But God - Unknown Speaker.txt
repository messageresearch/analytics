some of you might not it's okay it roughly translates to the footsteps in my heart has been put there by jesus christ and the second verse talks about how he calls me his son after that everyone's going to read a poem that he wrote specifically for that for sons as well and it's so in theme with what we've spoken about this weekend so i hope even though you might not understand it that you would be edified by and blessed by do my friend foreign foreign is heart foreign foreign here is to the fathers that taught there is no dust to your dreams here is to them who helped shape those castles in the sky endless it seems here is to the little soldiers that announced the jubilation here is to the hope they contain in their consecration either plunging in puddles or running through woods may their joy never depart let them chase christ's temperament that will furnish their ever glowing heart may the sweet scent of freedom cleave and may the singed furnace fumes be shaken and that call from the deep keep them memorized mesmerized keep their heart minds awakened catching fish making fire shouts from true tree tops adventure no shortage strive for that hunger and that fine tune of youth and never ending voyage may our hearts touch theirs not once nor twice but until our life's conclusion so in their veins to stay god's light and sweet grace what a glorious fusion let us teach to hunt and to persevere to the ends a gentleman's instruction to his descendants keep that zeal that mends we plead for victory in each quest but if so be let defeat be our study stand against the daunting and never forfeit no matter how cold dark or muddy here is to courage so that they may too graze eternity here is to the treasuring faith and charity with absolute certainty here is to the marching along with a heavenly trumpet and drum here is to our sons and if in thy will there is to come foreign you may stand as we go to worship lord we love you on the wings of the snow i oh

both night and day faith was he gave me god's sins is god sends its pure sweet a sign from above on the wings oh i know the time is near where everything that i hold near will lay before the holy

thy love for me unfailing love that chose calorie then such a one condemned as i would have no bar then and i die but thou o lord you took my place you took my place you took my place and you bore my sin on your shoulders me to be the one that you would die for the one that you would save the one that you would carry from the cradle to the grave the one that you would care for the one that you would raise the one that you would see through every storm and every way you chose me you chose me were not and me and i died you took my place on your shoulders the one that you care for the one that you received you chose me amen amen it just thrilled my soul to see god drop down last night and everyone run around the church and have a wonderful time people screaming and the greatest thing is burdens were lifted hearts were mended people were changed hallelujah amen hallelujah amen we've got one more service hallelujah this is not a filler service you're filling some time we're here to meet with the lord again amen so if you're expecting and you are expecting god will come and meet our needs you know why this camp has been such a blessing because you've come and you want to hear from the law your expectation brought him on the scene and he came for you hallelujah that's why i've had such a glorious time i mean so maybe if we just yeah let's just sing i'm amazed this is how brother tim comes amen god bless you all it just means such a wonderful time and my sins they're all washed away all my sins are washed i'm away that you love me and my sins are hallelujah why don't we give the lord a hand clap for all he's done for us this weekend amen amen isn't he wonderful thank you appreciate the musicians appreciate all the music the singing all of it has been so wonderful heard some new songs this weekend that i'm gonna take home with me and uh uh just was a real blessing a real blessing and uh i was i left uh fairly soon last night after the close before everybody or as everybody stayed i i just wanted to get myself in my room and uh just get my thoughts on the service this morning and and uh uh i was listening to all the singing and i thought lord you're visiting the people down there uh i should i wish i was there and here i am slogging it out i said sometimes my wife asked me what i'm studying how's it going i says beating my head against the rock that says but the rock is jesus and that's how eagles renew their youth as they beat their head against the rock and so that's just the way it goes sometimes amen brother already praise the lord enjoyed the service last night and the preaching of the word and i appreciate how brother already just summed everything up so far and i thought lord this morning help us to tie all the loose ends together i want to say thank you to brother ben for his invitation how many appreciate brother ben and all that he's done appreciate all those that work with him support the ministry you know there's a principle that is revealed in the message of the hour and that is if you rally around the gift that god sends you you will be very successful it comes from the greater than solomon is here brother branham says when israel rallied around solomon they had like a millennium but then jesus said greater than solomon is here but they didn't rally around that gift and israel went into judgment and so the the principle is god sends a gift you rally around it you support it you pray for it pray that god will be with the pastor brother ben all the ministries from the different churches that are here uh appreciate each and every one of you and those that were here some have probably had to be gone home already and and uh we're so thankful for each and every one of them and you've been a great congregation how many of you are from uh this area locally here put your hand up all right and how many of you are from other areas that's everybody else right amen i just wanted to see the contrast that's why i knew it was everybody else but uh praise the lord it's times like these that we can just let god have his way there's this old song that goes let go and let god have his way and we certainly appreciate that i love what the lord is doing here i've been watching brother ben and the brother that are working with him and sisters and all that's happening and i just love what i see it's great potentials you know there's no limit to what god can do a if you let him and b if you don't care who gets the credit god loves his bride and he loves this message which is his love letter to his bride and so as long as you're involved in that getting the message to the bride god will bless you that's the principle as soon as we start to project ourselves or build up a kingdom then god takes his blessing elsewhere because he's in love with his bride amen and we're in love with him amen amen so we have this last service and again up to how much of it just apprecia being here and uh brother uh the brother on the slides uh i gave him the day off we have no slides for you today and uh i'm not sure that's a good thing because he says it forces him to focus and listen to every word that i'm saying and watch my every action so you have to try and do that without my incentive amen let's take our bibles and turn to the book of ephesians chapter 2. i feel that the lord has done something for you this weekend amen i'm so glad for that so glad to be a part of that amen like brother branham said you know he said people try and uh as people think that i'm trying to say that that i'm the one doing these things he says i'm not the one doing them i'm only here when he's doing them you see that's the way the prophet was how much littler ought we to try and be amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer wonderful heavenly father lord we love you lord we couldn't say that enough we realize lord even as we have human relationships and those three words mean a whole lot to each other just i love you that we could tell somebody and confirm to them the affection that we have in our hearts for them and yet lord when we tell you that they seem insufficient they seem lord like words that that don't really express what our heart feels lord i pray that you just look down into into our hearts lord and see how we really feel about you that's one thing that you can do that we can't do we can't look into each other's hearts lord but lord you are the word that discerns the very thoughts and intents of our hearts we thank you lord that it does not say you discern the thoughts and intents of our mind and the raging battle that goes on there lord and will until the change of these mortal bodies but there will come a time in the millennium when the devil will be bound not physically lord but with a chain of circumstance lord for he won't have anybody to work on he will be unable to affect us any moral god never again will he be able to sow evil thoughts so contrary to your word within our minds but right now while we're in these mortal bodies we realize that we have a weakness lord we each have one punch as it were that the devil has coming at us and and lord we need to keep that covered we need to watch over we need to keep under the blood under the shadow of your wings o god so hover over us o great holy spirit lord take the service this morning into your hands maybe there be somebody in the service this morning that would feel like i got left by the wayside but lord won't you go by and pick them up this morning and touch them lord and know let them know father that you are remem you're remembering them and mindful of their needs lord just direct this little ministry according to the way that you would have it for we realize with you father all things are possible and we want to say lord we believe and so we commit ourselves to you for your glory and ask your blessing upon the reading and the speaking of the context of your word in jesus christ's name amen amen here's a scripture that i've grown to really love lately as as god has made himself very real through it to me and i trust that he will to you in verse 1 chapter 2 of ephesians verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience unless of course you were raised in a message home no it doesn't say that does it you all walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others my title is the next two words but god but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus amen the lord had his blessing to the word you may be seated i'm going to go quite quickly this morning so i i want you to give me your undivided attention i'll try not to hold you long but as a result i'll probably compress it just a little bit and i believe the lord will lead us the way that we should go now we realize that god is love and as we as first john 4 says we've been speaking about it this weekend we have known and believed the love that god hath to us how many believe that more now than when they first came here this weekend amen why do you believe it more because the word has been revealed to your heart and a revelation of the word is faith and by faith you are saved and that by grace not of works lest any man should boast and so we realize that revelation that god has poured in our heart it causes us to leave a camp meeting happy because revelation brings stimulation and and you know your stimulation brother branham likened it unto wine and how that wine is is something that stimulates an individual makes him forget his troubles and makes him forget all the things that are bad and kind of makes him happy for no good reason but the revelation of god's word makes us happy for a good reason amen it causes us to realize the thoughts that god has in his mind towards us so the bible says that he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him i was in south africa last month how many south africans or former south africans have we gotten here wow quite a few i'm sorry to see i mean that's wonderful and that's all right i teased the south africans back home we got a lot in our church too and uh i'll give them a rough time because south africans have a very peculiar nature praise the lord and we and we need them amen and i i had a chance to visit the the country last month and and uh visit one toured around a little bit preaching a lot of different churches met a lot of different believers fellowship with a lot of different ministry and and i thought now i understand praise the lord amen all of god's children are unique you're unique every one of you individually and god knows exactly what you have need of and as i was in south africa i was thinking about some quotes that i had read about the man called nelson mandela apparently one of the great men of our generation had to you know went from being at uh what they might call today a terrorist uh to studying law and become a leader of his people and and brought about the end of the apartheid system and all that goes with that and it doesn't really matter what our thoughts about whether what was right and what was wrong but i i i was in reading a couple things that he said in the news one time and one of the things that he said is no man is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion people must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love for love comes more naturally to the human heart than it's opposite now i better warn you before you say amen to here because i'm actually going to uh bring about the error of what he's saying and in another phrase he said education as he's speaking about teaching these things that he says they can be taught to love he says another place education is the most powerful weapon that you can use to change the world you know those are nice thoughts for this age that are based upon man's psychology and education but it's not the great power of god the message of the hour tells us differently because love is not taught it is experienced because love is god love is a person and when you have a portion of that person in you then you have love and that's why the apostle john could say he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him all right so appreciate what nelson mandela had to say in in his thoughts as far as humanity is concerned it probably was a great thought but you'll never teach humanity how to love the only way to get humanity to love is to get them to experience god and as brother branham said if people would have received the gift that was sent in this hour they wouldn't need a police force they wouldn't need a fire department they wouldn't need a hospital they wouldn't need governments all of these kind of things why because divine love would have taken over amen but that's where we're going to in the millennium time where divine love has the preeminence and and mandela said that education is not or education is the most powerful weapon and i would dispute that and say that education is not the most powerful weapon prayer is so love cannot be taught it must be experience weaponry is not education but it's prayer amen now i as a person i can't get away from the subject of god's love now i think i've made that pretty clear this weekend not my love or my feelings but understanding the power that is the very essence of god and that dwells in me particularly now brother branham likens it to an inheritance and and he says if you had an inheritance if you inherited he called it an arcade but if you inherited let's say a ranch or you inherited a piece of property you would want to go and see the property you would want to know the boundaries of the property you would want to know all the assets that are on the property you would want to know what's yours how it works how the water supply is how the power supply is you'd want to know what the building is you want to know what all the rooms are what they're used for where it's located how to access it how to enjoy it what's planted on the property the trees the vegetation everything why because it's yours you want to know everything about it but so is the love of god yours and we want to know i want to know everything about it i want to know all that it is and and people just talk about love from a human perspective as though oh you know just love everybody no it's not some wishy-washy uh half-baked kind of a nice feeling it's much more than that all right it's it's a the gospel starts with love we realize that god so loved the world the nature of god is love the fullness of the stature of a perfect man is love that's christ if i if i just turned over the page if you had your bibles open we could see even about the fivefold ministry is about love it says for the perfecting of the saints chapter 4 and verse 12 for the work of the ministry for the edifying or building up of the body of christ do we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ many people stop there but it goes further that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine now that we could go right to love there i think brother ben quoted it last night out of the church age book is people thought that love meant parental care that god's love was just doting over us almost like a grandfather but god doesn't have grandchildren he's only got children and so god's love is in election god's love is that he has children but he but the bible says it that we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive verse 15 says but speaking the truth in love now there's the there's this might been my central thought lately as i've been pondering the ministry and and raising the bride up edifying the bride of christ speaking the truth and love if you have truth and you have it in love that will bring about the stature of jesus christ many times we spoke the truth without love we had the truth in the message but the love wasn't there and then there's those maybe that are maybe a little bit uh off the word in their thinking and they want love without truth and say oh everything's just love but you got to have truth all right you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free and he that the son sets free is free indeed all right and so he says but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that which every joint supplieth now it doesn't say compacted by that which the fivefold ministry supplieth are you with me but which every every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying or the building up of itself in love praise be to god that's the purpose of the ministry that's the purpose of the church christ is the very love of god projected now god makes a son as we dealt with that and he looks at the earth like he looked at his it looks at his sons i think brother brother already dealt a little bit on it when he made the earth god's like a contractor he laid out everything on the earth everything that was necessary for your body was in the earth everything that was necessary for creation was in the earth when god made the earth all god had to do was brood over it and and and speak his word into it and that would bring forth life and so is it with his sons everything that he put that you everything that you have need of is potentially in the predestinated seed that lays within you all you've got to do is lay in the presence of god and let him bring the life to fruition out of that seed as brother always was mentioning like the tree and so i want to say this you know that as god made man there was part of man that couldn't be expressed until there was a wife and god was reflecting himself that he couldn't express all that he was until he had a wife and now i want to say naturally speaking young men if you want to understand love get god if you want to know what love is get god get so full of him until you see him in every thought that you have you've got to catch his inspiration behind every objective that you have in your life and if you don't have you don't see god in an objective you need to get rid of the objective amen god somebody tell me amen here amen help me out this morning young women i know we're all tired but you know let's just press in just a little bit amen young women you won't find god in a novel or you won't find love in a novel excuse me god is love but you won't find love in a novel which which books and uh there's something about young women and romance stories i'll just hit this while i'm here that they get attracted to that it's a natural attraction because they want a romantic relationship and it's natural to desire a romantic relationship but what you read in a book is not the truth the truth of a romantic relationship you'll find in here you'll find it in the book of esther you'll find it in the book of of ruth you'll find it in the book of song of solomon you'll find it in many places in this bible but you won't find the truth of it in any novel amen in many things many things of which have hurt marriages but yet until you see god in everything you don't find what love is there was a little boy you know might know the story how that and i say it often to repeat it sometimes as ministers we think everybody has already heard everything and so we just skip right over it but a lot of times people have never heard it there's young ones that have never heard it people that are are new to the light of the hour that have never heard it but there was a young man a boy that went to his mother and says mother is it possible to see god and she said no i don't know sonny i i can't answer that you maybe should ask your sunday school teacher and so he goes to a sunday school teacher and and he's asked the sunday school teacher says teachers can a person see god and the teacher said oh that's too deep for me and and uh and she said you better maybe ask the pastor and maybe after the service that's a good question for him so he waited after the service for the pastor and the pastor came out and he asked the pastor excuse me uh pastor he says is it possible for a person to see god and the pastor being a good theologian he said sonny the bible says no man has seen god at any time and so no i'm sorry it's not possible to see god and that didn't really satisfy him and there was something on the inside of the inside that says like we're saying this morning all i want to see is jesus and and one day he was out in a boat with an old fisherman that had had taken the little boy under his wing and he's out there fishing and they're out early in the morning which is a good time to go fishing and the sun is just beginning to come up over the water and the old man is sitting in the end of the boat and there's tears rolling down his cheeks and the boy says looks at the old man and he comes over closer to him and he says sir i want to ask you a question he says is it possible to see god the old man took the boy up in his arms and he said sonny that's all i see is god i see him everywhere i see him in the sunrise i see him in the sunset i see him in all ways in my life and even in all the trials that i've been through i've seen the tender hand of jehovah that's been guiding me all along the way i can imagine that all that adam could see was god as he was in the garden of eden and even though god himself in person came down in the cool of the evening but as adam walked around creation that's probably all that he saw was god he saw him in nature he saw him in the way the animals were he saw him solomon in everything that god had created but satan through the serpent tried to intellectualize god and he tried to get eve to see god from a different perspective have you ever thought about god in this way god is not a thought god is not a doctrine god is not an intellectual god is a person amen that reflects himself in his creation and so as as the serpent tried to get eve to intellectualize it we realize that separated her from behind the word the protection of the word and that caused the fall of all humanity and the separation of humanity from god was to intellectualize what god had spoken all right so the the serpent said well as as god said that you lead all eating on all the trees she says no god said we can eat all the trees but the tree of knowledge of good and evil we're not to partake of it because the day we thereof that day we die and the serpent had a nice way of explaining it away he says you know what god didn't really mean that what he meant was you become like gods you'll kind of change that's what he means by death and you know it'll be like this and you know you know if you tie this quote to this scripture and tie this back in over here and you'll remember how that he said back in 1947 and tie that to 1965 and put that all together my pretty soon he's got her living in the millennium and she thought nothing bad can happen to me and she ate and she and she died and adam partook with her not being deceived but because of love he said i can't live without you brother bam talks about a girl that went off to college and uh how that she uh she got intellectualized she got educated and what that means is she got imparted a culture by books to think that's the way human beings think and so she she was thinking about what's acceptable and what's not acceptable and how you know she was amongst a bunch of peers and peer pressure and and begin to look at life in a certain way and have a certain status and as she came home from college with one of her friends she arrived at the train station and her mother was waiting there but her mother was hideously scarred from a fire and so his friend was looking out she noticed her mother but she didn't know it was her mother and she said oh look at that ugly woman out there and and uh uh she looked so hideous and and the daughter uh she got off the train and the mother tried to acknowledge her and the daughter walked right past her not wanting to acknowledge her because of what her friend had said why love had wax cold sin shall abound because the love of many waxed cold and so now as he as as the the conductor was looking on this and knew the mother in the situation he took the daughter aside and said do you realize what you've just done is that what you learned by education it says you don't even know he says you're a little pretty girl he says but you'll never compare to the beauty your mother used to be he says but your mother she gave up her beauty that your life might be spared she became scarred that you might be unscarred and so he says to her you don't realize when you were a baby the house was on fire and the only way for you to get out was for your mother to go in so she wrapped herself in a towel she ran in she grabbed you but instead of wrapping herself back up she wrapped you in the towel and she came out and so is it with the lord jesus christ expressing his love i'll never be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ he left his glory in heaven and wrapped himself in our sins and beast came scarred that we might escape our scars brother branham says in that quote he says i think brother when it taken one thing not an intellectual being but it taken the love of god to send christ to the cross and to die there in disgrace and shame and you mean to tell me that the pentecostal church or any other church will turn down the real love of god i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ it's the power of god to salvation if you'd rather say holy roller let us act like that as long as the love of god is down in my heart certainly it doesn't matter it says god gave the holy spirit god's love to control the church not smart and educated but love gifts goes in the church but it doesn't control the church love controls the church amen you know we've come back to the revelation of the title deed we've been restored back not just to the faith of our fathers because that was that was part of malachi 4's ministry but there was also revelation 10 that said all the mystery of god would be finished so we've gone beyond the faith of our fathers because they didn't have all that was written in the book because john was told don't write it it's not for this age it's for the last days in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound so we're here we come back to the title deed that should be all that we see not intellectualizing the message but the message is the word spoken in spirit spoken in truth and love and brings a bride into position you know uh we should only see what god's doing there's a lot evil all around us as i said in the first service we might be dissatisfied with the government dissatisfied with the police dissatisfied with the medical system you know we might be dissatisfied with so many different things but let me tell you something i was

say you know charles finney was asked to prove the message one guy came up to him one time and said to charles finney i believe in god i want you to prove to me that what you believe is better than what i believe and charles finney just looked at the at the young man and he said let me ask you a question he says in all that god has revealed to you so far he says do you serve him fully in the light of what you already know and the man said had to be honest and answer no i guess i don't he says will you go and serve god fully in the light that you already know and then come back and ask me the question again then i'll answer it amen see so many people want to be proven but really they just want to pick holes in it but really if they just believe there's a god hello if they just believe there's a god and start from there if they really believe there's a god that god will reveal himself to them and go from there see we're see we're not a denomination we are seekers of truth we're not like pilate that says what is truth rather we are like the disciples who say we have found truth and to whom would we go for thou alone has the words of eternal life i was in india one time and there was a 12 year old boy that came up to me had a he had a little rag on his head uh signifying he was a sikh and they have the little when they get baptized they they the sikhs don't cut their hair men are women and so they that's why they wear the turbans and they wraps their hair up on top of their head and so this little boy was about i don't know 12 13 maybe and he came up to me after the service and he said sir i want you to prove to me that what you're telling is the truth and i actually didn't think of finney at the time and i thought here's a boy i says well tell me what you believe he says well i'm a catholic and i said well if you're a catholic why do you have that sikh rag on your head it wasn't a turban it was just the little bun that they have as a young person and he said well my family is sick and he says late recently i converted to catholicism because i couldn't believe what the sikh was teaching and now i'm a catholic and that's what i believe right now he says but why should i believe what you believe and i said to him i says i can't answer that question but god can i says and here's what you do and the pastor was standing there i says this man will give you some books and i want you to read a couple of those books and you ask god if it's real 2014 i went back to india and a young man about 20 22 years old somewhere in there 21 years old came into the room where we were fellowship and the pastor said i want you to meet somebody and so he walked into the room and he looked at me he says he says do you remember me and i said i said no and you know fine looking just the glow of the gospel on his face and i said he said i i met you about 10 years ago and then it was like the lord turned the light on i said you had a question and i said you wanted me to tell you why this message was the truth and then smile it up he says it says you remember i says i remember he says i believe the message hallelujah now he's a preacher in this message and not only that he's won many souls to the lord jesus christ amen why is that because god proved it to him individually listen if god doesn't prove it to somebody i can't it's just that simple i'm not in the business of proving it i'm in the business of telling it and if god will come down and prove it to you he will show himself alive amen so we know that all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church and acts chapter 2 was the love that was in god or the love that was god the holy ghost coming into the church it's not a half-baked love but it's it's uh it's the fullness of the power of god because when i say it's not a half-baked love what i mean is that you've got to understand the god who is love is also a judge you see it's not that love that that just excuses everybody for everything no it's as i think brother ben said a pardon that has been given but you must receive the pardon and that was the verdict of the u.s government in a particular law case a pardon is not a pardon unless it is received as a pardon you just have to accept what god has done for you you know jesus said and i've quoted it already thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy souls with all thy mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and prophets my all of the law and prophets even hangs on love think about that so we read ephesians 2 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us but god it's not just a poetic addition to the bible by the translators that's exactly the way paul said it but god comma who is rich in mercy the amplified says it this way i'm not a big promoter of the amplified bible but sometimes they get it right it says but god so rich is he in his mercy because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which he loved us now catch the way you know the king james just just uses the distinct little phrase he says for his love wherewith he loved us but the amplified says because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which he loved us my what a statement great and wonderful and intense but not just leaving it there but he in order to satisfy that love see christianity is not works it's not man's efforts but it's god's love reaching its destination it's a continuous unfolding to all who believe doesn't matter how long you've been in the way god will continually unfold himself to you we'll be learning about him throughout all eternity or he's not an infinite god infinite means without limit so we'll always be discovering new things about our lord then that means if god is love then we ought to be always discovering new things about love my we sometimes just limit ourselves too much and many times as preachers we often we our temptation is just to preach the catch phrases and just throw out the little things that that we know are trues and they're real to us but god has commissioned us even as brother branham said he says now you brothers i'm just touching the surface of it you dig down into these things and you bring it to the people and that's our commission as ministers is to dig down so sometimes if if it seems like we're we're we're we've arrived at some little intricate thought that seems so buried so down so far why is that significant but god has raided it made it real to the minister and he's got to unburden his heart brother branham says in the message god rich in mercy he says if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of god and god is the only thing that's eternal what does eternal mean without beginning and without end so if you've got eternal life you've got life that is without beginning and without end if you're an eternal creature you're a creature without beginning and without end you always were in the mind of god god never thought a new thought that's something that's hard for us to imagine uh no disrespect i appreciate the thought that brother already was bringing yesterday but i can't view god like a balloon that grew and grew and grew and grew because god never thought a new thought and and so it always was in his mind that he would have you and that's what makes it amazing because i find brother already's explanation easier and i i'd love to believe it that way but i cannot fathom a god that always thought everything it's impossible for my human mind but that's our god and our pea brains can't grasp that how great our god is but no matter how great you can imagine him he's greater than that because he's infinite and even when you go back there and all of that you were there in his infinity you were there in his mind his thoughts are not just eternal they're substance they're real they must come into manifestation in their season in this realm but they always were real in the mind of god oh listen that's beyond human understanding i don't know about you but but that's way beyond me maybe you got a better education than i do and you can understand it better but i cannot fathom it it is way beyond me brother brown goes on he says now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well then he before he even become material on the earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knew what color what color hair you would have i'll just say he knew what color skin you'd have too all right he know all about you all right when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would just be certain things that would just it wouldn't bother the other kids but there was seemed like there was something in you that cried out see that's the eagle in the chicken yard there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner and he says you remember that so i'll ask you do you remember that amen that's a common trait of the elective god he says certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this or that went from denomination to denomination but one day you being a part of god you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you came from you knowed that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it hallelujah he says that's the way it is with every born-again believer you can hear all the theology you want to all the man-made discrepancy but when that word flashes out there then there is something takes a hold you come to it and then he quotes the scripture that we read you who were once dead in sin that life has he quickened amen now i said yesterday that a that agopo or god's love has three forms that's agape agapo agapetos that's the noun the verb and the adjective i never got to the adjective and so i'll just maybe drop this in as we're in this subject the agapeos being the adjective it's actually describes the object of the love all right so you got love love projected and then you have a gap pedo so might as well give you the word now that is translated in the bible beloved the object of god's love now david was a man that had a great love for god and he wanted to build a temple for god how many you know the story second samuel chapter seven uh david talks about you know to the prophet he says i want to build here i'm living in this great house and god's living under a tent he says how right is that that's not right at all he says i really would need to build something great for god that's greater than what i live in because he's greater than what i am and so so now he had the right inspiration and it was the right time but the problem was he wasn't the right man and he and that's the reason that god sent the prophet back to him because initially the prophet said david you're a man after god's own heart do whatever is in your heart because the lord is with you and and then god the prophet goes home and in his prayer time god says to him go back and tell david and he says to him thou shalt say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheep coat from following the sheep to be a ruler over my people over israel and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover i will appoint a place where my children israel will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them no more any no neither will the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as before time and as since the time that i commanded the judgment the judges to be over my people israel i'm sorry and have caused thee to rest from all mine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee a house and when those days are fulfilled i will set up thy seat after thee and he shall proceed out of thy bowels i will establish his kingdom and he shall build a house for my name and i shall establish the throne of his kingdom forever and then he says i will be his father and he shall be my son all right now catch this now because i said when i was dealing with the name yesterday i said now remember was solomon that wrote proverbs that says uh my son despised not thou the chastening of the lord for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth all right so solomon wrote that as he's speaking about sonship but he's also the one whom god's speaking of saying here i will be his father and he shall be my son all right so he's speaking from that perspective of his relationship with god and he and god goes on says if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men all right let's get the picture here now are you with me all right now we find out that david what type of a man was he he was a warrior he was a fighter and because of that you know he brought the nation of israel if you actually go back into history you'll find the ultimate of what god had chosen for israel was the kingdom of david and solomon from the time that they entered into the kingdom to the time of that reign and you'll find out in the bible it's about 490 years about that time you see god works in 70 weeks with israel in that cycle and so now god is dealing in that cycle he brought them to the pinnacle because it was only david they conquered jerusalem and god allowed that to wait until that time there was in other words a revelation waiting for the end of the cycle to bring them into position just like we've come to the end of seven church ages there was a revelation waiting that had to be revealed in this hour all right but you can't just sit back you've got to take it you've got to possess it all right footsteps is possession so now david god said i made you a great name like the great men of the earth so david the name david his parents could say we called him david but jehovah was the one that gave him a name that ranked amongst a great man so much so that when you say david you think of a king because it's a it's a name that means something remember i said a name is a mark of memorial or honor and so the name david was a representation of all that he stood for so god took the name of david from the sheep coat from being a shepherd and raised it up to one of the highest name in the earth that when people hear the name david they think of the king that ruled over israel one of the greatest kings that ever walked on the face of the earth all right but there's a problem there in raising his name up david's name got in the way of god's name i gave you a name but there's going to come somebody after you to build a house for my name you can't build a house for my name because of the characteristics that the name david represents see if you want to do something for god you have to humble yourself not be lifted up you see that's why even as we've come now into the second generation of the message now i realize we're past the beginning of it but we're fully into the second generation of the message and we realize that in the second generation of the first exodus as israel was coming out of egypt what did you have you had names moses aaron dathan cora abyram joshua caleb lots of big names that we all recognize but going into the promised land tell me the names of the princes of the second generation you can't do it they're there in the bible but they're not significant why because they're moving into a different kind of ministry the bride is moving into a different sphere now there was a time in the message that there was big-name preachers you know i can name names and you maybe recognize the names but the names aren't important but those names are going off the scene now but we are called to possess the land and it will god will possess this land by a body working together every joint supplying to the body now david his own name actually uh ties back to the word beloved in many ways but it's not the name beloved but it's it ties back to it they say they're they're there's an uncertain uh um uh i don't know what you call entomology or something that's a big word that's a 50 cent word but you know it's i don't know what you call it where the name comes from there uh whatever it's connected to all the beginnings of it i i don't understand that stuff but you know it's there's something about it david that's tied to that but they're uncertain about it but david was a man that people loved you know saul loved david but with human love that's why human love is so corruptable bible says one place he loved him says in another place he was jealous of him and then finally says he hated him so filio love can turn from love to hatred but agapo love will never turn from love to hatred all right and so david now uh he was loved by women 500 wives mercy and there's nothing wrong with a good wife but you know i i'll leave it there i'll just say to your brother brothers but you know amen and he's loved by the nation of israel amen israel loves david what do they have on their flag the star of david it's a significant to them they're looking for the throne of david david was loved by god he was a man after god's own heart but after david took bathsheba and killed uriah because bathsheba became pregnant from their adultery and david set uriah up for a fall and and actually was accomplice in his murder and so that god accounted it as murder and so that in all of that now we would say if as we looked at david and bathsheba and all of that and the first son that came out of that or the son that was born excuse me out of that adultery god took the life of that child it died within seven days and now we would look at that maybe in our legalistic viewpoint and say nothing good will ever come out of that relationship we would say that there's no hope the beginnings of it are wrong it was there's adultery there's murder there's all kinds of wrong things but yet god had something in mind here you see the way of god is way higher than mankind don't ever judge something just because you think you understand it rather just say lord reveal to me your mind in this situation you might say you might be better off just to walk away from and say lord i don't understand i just don't understand you know there's nothing wrong with having questions matter of fact we'll have questions right up to this body change because then we will know even as we are known the questions will all be answered by and by but as we go through life you might have questions tonight you know brother tim i've had questions for years that i've wondered about so have i just because i study the word and pray and preach and all those kind of things that doesn't mean i don't have questions there's always things as god opens a little bit of the window you want to see a little bit further and you have a question well how does this fit or how does that fit any ministers know what i'm talking about you always have these things just let it be god will reveal it in his season it's not for us to understand and to counsel god is for god to understand and counsel us amen so now david the bible says after the child died he comforted his bathsheba his wife and went in to unto her and lay with her and she bear a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him hallelujah just like jacob have i love he saw have i hated and he sent by the hand that's god sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and called his name jedediah because of the lord and the word jedediah means beloved of jehovah my so now here's god representing something in solomon because he was a type of the son of david where god would come down at the baptism of the lord jesus christ in the fullness of his deity to take up residence in the lord jesus christ and say this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell so beloved is a representation of the object of god's love are you with me god says about solomon he prophesied concerning and said he shall build a house for my name i shall establish his throne of his kingdom forever i will be his father and he will be my son amen so solomon knew what it was to be a type of the lord jesus christ even the lord jesus christ had to learn obedience by the things that he suffered amen now why is that it's not that he was disobedient we were sometimes disobedient as we walked by the spirit that works in the children of disobedience but yet christ was never disobedient he was only tempted to be disobedient but he had to suffer things by his obedience contrary to the disobedience of the age jesus said as the father has loved me so have i loved you what does that mean as i am the beloved of my father so are you my beloved hallelujah brother branham says in the church age book he says it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him all right let me just rephrase that you were chosen before the foundation of the world in him you i'm gonna instead of she i'm gonna say you you were foreknown and beloved before you were ever brought forth in the ages upon the earth you were redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation listen to what he says you were redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation have you accepted what he's done for you then you can never come into condemnation as our brother said you can never pay twice for the same sin it's a double indemnity clause it's you can't do that god already paid for your sin on calvary by the blood of jesus christ and he redeemed you by that blood and you accepted his pardon then you can never come into the condemnation you can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed to you i don't know how you're still sitting down praise the lord sin cannot be imputed to me i have accepted what the lord jesus christ has done for me i have no merits in myself there's nothing that i have done but i accept fully what he did for me i can never come into the condemnation i can never come into the judgment because sin cannot be imputed to me blessed is the man to whom god cannot impute sin hallelujah why because you were beloved in his thoughts you were in love in his mind you were the object of the love that was god and that love became expressed and to sovereign grace produced the object amen the object is his beloved the object is his elect you've been in his mind and now he's here to fellowship with you hallelujah he took it out of his mind and put it in the flesh just like he took eve out of adam and she was the object of his love that's why when she fell and the serpent with the serpent adam could have said tough luck you did it you've got to pay for your own sin i know what it what it is i know exactly what's happened i know exactly what you've done and i'm not having any part of it but he didn't he took eve he says honey i can't live without you he was a type of cries he says i don't care what you've done and i know that if i let you go you'll die and i'll live but my life isn't worth living without you laurie that's the expression of jehovah who said my life is not worth living without you hallelujah he became sin that we might become sinless he became man that we might become deity expressed in human flesh what is it the love of god it's beyond human thinking it's beyond anything that man has done i got a letter from india one time not too long ago actually a brother was asking me some questions about relationships and different things and what about this and how should this be handled in the church and that sort of thing and i replied i just said this is what's in the message this is what's in the scripture you've got to apply the word it says here's what it is it's not up for me to run your church it says i'll give you what the message says about it and then you got to pray about it and apply it so then that was fine i thought i'd heard the end of it then he wrote me back and i could see the first letter was to test me so that he could write the second letter and then he said brother tim i so appreciated what you said in the first letter i thought it was very well applied i have one more question he says is it does a man have a right to put away his wife for fornication now i'm in a spot aren't i you can now see there's a motive behind this somebody wants me to support him in what he wants to do all right i thought lord how am i going to answer this man because the scripture definitely says about these things and i thought lord what am i going to do and then it came to me i said brother i says yes a man has a right to put away his wife for the cause of fornication that's right in the scripture i said but because something because you have a right to do something doesn't make it the right thing to do and i said the lord jesus had a right to put us away god had a right to put israel away and have nothing to do with them anymore but he says i'll never forget you you're written on the palms of my hands amen that's the god that we serve that reflected himself in adam and says i can't live without you hallelujah because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which he loved us in order to satisfy his great love he quickened us by grace you'll never get beyond love you'll never be able to to move beyond that kind of a realm in your relationship with god brother branham says when god's love was projected sovereign grace had to produce the object that his love projected he says when you love god and believe god grace will project the object that you ask god says your abraham's seed then you love god and when you love god so love him that you believe his word accept his word then sovereign grace will come down and project what you ask god because he cannot keep from it think about it that's the basis that it's on is love and love will project grace and grace will project the object that you're asking for you can't get it by emotions you can't get it by scholarship in other words by learning doesn't matter how many quotes scriptures you know how much you can tie together that ain't going to produce nothing it's got to be love paul says in the in first corinthians though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not love i am nothing is this all right this morning it says you never get it by education you never get it by sensations you get it by love you believe him and take his word for it and when you take his word that makes him love you and you get what you ask for see that's the rapture when you believe him and accept his word and just love him then sovereign grace will produce the object that you're asking for see there's got to be a bride that's uncomfortable in this world remember in the first exodus when god came down to deliver israel he said i have heard the cry of my people all right by reason of what they're task masters by reason of the the living that they have been subjected to down there in egypt there was many years that they were comfortable but then there rose up a pharaoh that knew not joseph and so god had to make the age uncomfortable because it wasn't his will to leave his the children of israel in egypt he had a promise for them and it's not his will to leave the bride on this earth amen he's got a place for you but there's got to make it uncomfortable till his bride begins to cry out oh lord we're not comfortable here we're not happy here it's got to get evil it's got to become a sodomite age it's got to become ruled by unjust laws it's got to be a persecution against religion there's got to be all those kind of things not necessarily a personal persecution but against that which is right and so because of that age there's got to be a cry out to god god has a way of turning things around just when it seems like there's no hope you know back when i'm going to go quickly now back when abraham was being dealt with by god abraham was god's servant somebody mentioned that already and and he lied about his wife and said that's my sister and abimelech took the took the woman and and is going to marry her and they got it all arranged and they're just coming up till seems like the day before the marriage and then the scriptures scripture says but god came to abimelech in a dream by night amen it all looked bad but god protected the seed line when satan would disrupt what god had already spoken but god came down just at that time he watched over jacob even before he came to the full revelation of who god was and jacob paid seven years for rachel in seven years for leah and and six years for wages and all the things that he suffered and when he left the land he recounted it to his father-in-law he says he or to his wives he says i see your father's countenance is not before not towards me anymore he says but the god of my father has been with me it says you knew with what power i've served your father and your fathers deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me think about that statement brothers that are working sometimes we have a lot to complain about of the way that we're treated at work and that's the way uh that's the way jacob was talking about his father-in-law it wasn't right the way i was treated he changed my wages ten times i just served him with all my strength and i never got the full reward from it but god suffered him not to hurt me amen god allowed these things to happen this way saw david was being pursued by saul he abode in the wilderness and strongholds remained in the mountains in the wilderness of zif as the bible says and the bible says saul sought him every day he's living in us you know how small israel is it's a tiny nation and saul is pursuing him every day then the scripture says but god delivered him not into his hand it wasn't david it was god sometimes we think oh this almost happened to be that old man it wasn't you it was god watching over you david writes who have i in heaven but thee there is none upon the earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart hallelujah but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever i love the story of joseph i went through a a very serious trial in my life and uh not really a trial of my faith as much as a trial on my stamina i never really wavered in my faith knowing god does all things well most of you know if you're not all of you know that i lost my wife in 2012 but she wasn't sick matter of fact they did a complete autopsy on her never found any reason why she should have died but i thought it was shocked to the medical community i could see that they actually suspected me because here's a healthy woman and she died and they thought my but you know i had about as wonderful a relationship as a man could have with his wife and and in that you know i had always thought in myself you know what if i lose everything if i lose the church if i lose the children if i lose my ministry if i lose everything as long as i got allison i'd be happy so what god take see if you want god to take you further be careful what you pray for lord whatever it takes but god knows what every man can handle i it was just brought in into my remembrance who was the song leader this morning you were god was leading you just to remind me of this uh you know when i was 50 years old they had an anniversary for me i hope you don't mind the personal commentary but they had a 50th birthday thing for me at the church and they all got together and they made a video and all these kind of things the slideshow of my life and my ministry and that that was very nice but the song that they set it to was now i know the time is near when everything that i hold dear and i was sitting there watching that i thought isn't that strange not only did they set it to that song they said it to my wife singing that song and i didn't think anything of it at the time three months later she was gone god has a way of doing things and taking a man and i looked at the life of joseph and i as i was in the trial that i was as i was you know i wasn't i felt like i was dropped in a pit like joseph it wasn't all of a sudden here will lower you down easy you know just a little bit oh just here you go and uh you know you're down in the bottom all of a sudden unexpectedly you don't get to say goodbye to your wife you know you're you're it's just gone just ended and and so you know you maybe if i'd have been more spiritually sensitive it wouldn't have been that way maybe i would have known what was happening there were certainly indications you know god god knows what he's doing seemed like my wife knew it was happening she began to give things away and say take care of this i won't need it no more and you know things like that would happen and and but nobody really noticed it and so as i as i began i knew what it would be a long journey i said to myself this is probably going to be the worst thing i'll ever go through in my life and so while i'm here i want to look around as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'm not going to fear no evil i know i'm going to suffer i know it's going to be hard but yet in the midst of it i want to really see all the details of it so i begin to study different lives in the bible like job and like joseph now i did this for your sakes tonight not for my sakes not for my sake because sometimes there we go through trials where it seems like the closer we get the further we are away joseph had a dream several dreams actually a couple of dreams that he saw his family bowing down to him and he related that to his family and and there they were they that's part of the thing that made them jealous of him especially his brethren here he was a a spiritual boy b called to be a leader and he was younger over them and younger than they were and so so they became jealous until finally the devil anointed that and we know the story how he got sold down into egypt they threw him in a pit they pulled them out of the pit sold them to the medianites now he's on a camel or on the ground on tied to a rope being walking down towards egypt and every day that goes by he's getting further away from the ones that were in the dream all right he believed god but it seemed like he was going further and further away from it becoming a reality and so as he got down there into egypt you know he thought oh my you know uh what am i going to do and and god knows how to direct things and he's sold into potiphar's house potiphar is the captain of the guard of egypt all right so now he's a fairly wealthy man and potiphar recognizes the gift in another man see there's nobody that's successful without recognizing the gift in somebody else and so he recognizes the gift in joseph and he puts him in charge of his whole household and so there joseph is thinking well at least i'm comfortable everything's going all right everything looks good so he had gone downhill but now it looks like things were trending uphill and so things are going better now and everything's coming together and just as everything looks pretty good potipher's wife takes a liking to him a catastrophe happens she she wants to commit adultery on her husband with joseph and joseph runs away from it flees from it stays away from it finally one day she she's had enough of his resistance and she just uh takes the coat that he left behind and accuses him of trying to do to her what she was trying to do to him now joseph who was up here gets thrown into prison not killed but thrown into prison now looks like there's no hope he had dreams back here sent from god he's a prophet he said your your brethren will bow down to you here he is in prison looks like there's no way it's going to come to pass there's no way those will ever come to pass months go by years go by he's in prison a long time god knows how to mold a man and so there he is in prison and finally the the pharaohs butler and the baker come you know the story the and they have dreams and and joseph interprets the dreams for them and the and the baker's gonna be killed and the butler's gonna be restored then he says to the butler he says remember me when you get back to pharaoh's house and then you know know that i did good for you and just remember me i don't i mean here by a false accusation and the butler said no problem joseph i'll remember you praise the lord joseph is happy ah it's almost over hallelujah week goes by nothing another week goes by nothing a month goes by nothing three months goes by nothing six months goes by god don't you hear me nothing's happening a year goes by oh god don't you know i'm suffering yeah he knows you're suffering knows exactly what you're going through nothing changes a year and a half goes by nothing finally the bible says at the end of two full years the butler remembers oh because something triggered his memory pharaoh had a dream and nobody could interpret it and the butler's standing there and pharaoh's about to kill all the wise men and he and the butler says oh pharaoh forgive me i made a terrible mistake there was a man in prison and when i was there he was used of god to interpret my dream and it came to pass he says maybe he'll help you so joseph after two full years he's in prison and everything as far as he is concerned is lost and then one moment he hears his name call joseph joseph we're looking for joseph somebody tell me which prisoner is joseph oh here's this one right over here what do you want joseph are you the interpreter of dreams oh my something began to change all of a sudden and in one day joseph goes from all hope being lost to the right hand of pharaoh listen saints it might seem like we've been down a wrong a long road it might seem like individually you've been down a long road but all of a sudden it'll turn for you that's the kind of god that we serve because when he puts you through a trial he's preparing you for something i had brothers write me when my wife passed away and they knew of the suddenness of it and all that and they said brother tim you must be a great man oh yeah that's really how i felt and they said because god chose you to go through such a hard trial and and i didn't say that to make you think i'm a great man i just said that to make you think i think just like you do i'm not a great man and i don't want this trial you ever been there i'm a nobody and and and what i'm going through i'd rather reverse it all but yet in the midst of it all god had a purpose in it and a matter of fact i wouldn't even be here today if my wife had not passed away i'd have still been the pastor of a little church in northern canada as far as i know i wouldn't have been here because i'd been pastoring i didn't travel near as much when i was pastoring but it was god's will to change my ministry it was god's will to put me into a different position and it's god's will to take you further than you've ever been before when job who was a great man and had much wealth and much respect and much wisdom and all that god had in his life but god so loved job he bragged about him to the devil knowing what the devil's reaction was going to be see the devil can't do nothing on his own he's just a tool in the hand of god to take you through what you need to until god comes down and says satan just get away i'm done now and so god says to the devil as you considered my servant job a perfect man a man that issue with evil a man that loves me oh my have you thought about him and the devil said sure yeah i thought about him because you've got to hedge around about him i can't get at him and you know the story god allows him but what was the purpose in god taking job through all that the entire purpose was not for job just to be humbled it was for him to catch a revelation that he could not catch any other way the reason you're going through your trial is because god's bringing a revelation to you that you cannot catch any other way and so which would you rather have go back to your life before the trial and skip the revelation or have the trial and say lord whatever revelation you have for me please bring it soon hallelujah because we've all been there and i only share my personal experience just to tell you we've all been there and i've been through it you've been through it but when it comes to the end of it there's always something good that god has for you amen but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us oh my sometimes we don't understand that god thinks so much differently than we do but god when the church looked like a hopeless case the con the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm the locust had eaten the church up to nothing in the dark ages but god said i will restore saith the lord it's not what man it's not what the outward looks like i'll give you a little secret can you keep a secret that's the way we are isn't it i'll tell you a secret but don't tell anybody brother biscuit has an expression he says i've lived by an expression it is what it is no sense getting upset about it it just it is what it is so my wife was in the store and she sent me a picture of a block of wood just like this written on it was it is what it is and it was just before christmas time and so i said buy it and she brought it home and i wrapped it up just in plain paper and i snuck it into the office and i put on brother biscuit's desk and i wrote on happy birthday and i didn't tell him who it was from and he doesn't know to this day who it's from so don't tell him but it is what it is it's i thought it was so perfect because it's just a block of wood it is what it is right what is it it is what it is sometimes it's that way in our life what am i supposed to do with this it is what it is it's here for some purpose i don't know what the purpose is but it is what it is praise the lord god knows what he's doing when it looked like the devil had so perverted christianity but god who is rich in mercy said i'm not done yet the seed had to fall into the ground and die lest it would abide alone and now i'm ready to bring my life into manifestation amen it looked hopeless but god said i will restore it's never hopeless martha and mary found that out as they said lord he's four days dead by now he stinks he's so far gone four days journey out into eternity but that didn't stop god but god who is rich in mercy came on the scene to show us that nobody is too far gone amen it doesn't matter how far your loved ones are gone it doesn't matter what struggles you're having with your children i've had eight children and i've struggled with them all my life and that doesn't mean anything but god who is rich in mercy for his great love gave me a token that i could claim my children say lord i'm not letting them go the devil cannot have them they are mine and they are yours by the grace of god but god who is rich in mercy it's never too far gone the woman that was caught in adultery brought her to jesus said didn't bring the man i don't know why but they brought the woman and you know i think we're too hard on the women sometimes oh sisters that was an easy one to say amen to come on i think sometimes we're too hard on the women thank you all right and they they they brought they brought her to jesus and and they're there they say you know the word says the law says she should be stoned but here was the love that the law was based upon all of the law and the prophets hang on these two things love the lord with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself so jesus says to the man the second part love her as yourself let him that is without sin cast the first stone if you wouldn't cast a stone at yourself then go ahead and cast one at her and they one by one jesus stooped down wrote in the sand don't know what he wrote but one by one he's looking at the sand no doubt he's seeing the feet around disappear one by one one gone another one gone another one gone pretty soon there's only one set of feet and it's the woman he lifts up his head he says woman where are your accusers now this is the blood that speaketh better things than that of abel that's life that was in that blood is in me and you neither do i condemn you go your way and sin no more amen what happened like the widow of nain that thought that it was over the funeral procession was going but it happened to go by jesus but god who is rich in mercy as jesus stood there and the funeral procession goes by and she had nobody to take care of her no more jesus stopped the funeral procession raised the boy from the dead and presented him back to his mother why because god who is rich in mercy amen israel down in egypt looked doomed to slavery but god looked down upon them saying i have heard their cry amen there's only one thing to do in your life brother branham says that's love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength with all your mind and believe every word that he says is the truth truth and love and when you come to the end of the road in where you can't go any farther then divine sovereign grace will be projected but god who is rich in mercy i'm bringing it to a close now there was one sister one young girl that was here with her mother walking out the other day and she said she counted you said you were closing five times i said i'm about to close amen i don't hold it against a little girl i think that's perfect you know sometimes us ministers need to be corrected you know we we get speaking a little evangelically you know we when not that we stretch it but sometimes we say things without saying the whole thing and and we and we actually don't realize that it sounds like a mistake because we're not saying the whole thought we say a portion and then we don't realize what this that portion sounds like by itself and so we have to be careful all right but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us but god who is rich in mercy for his agape with which he agapod us the agapettos the love that he projected to his beloved the result produced sovereign grace the bride is the definition of beloved brother branham says in the latest in church age he says now has set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself there before him lies all mankind is one lump of clay out of that same lump he will make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy see when he corrects you it doesn't mean he loves you charles spurred it doesn't mean he doesn't love you i'm sorry that's why you didn't say amen to that when he when he corrects you it doesn't mean he doesn't love you charles spurgeon made a statement he says i know that god loved me before i was born because he would have never loved me after i was born that's one of those statements put your name there the way you were the way i was reprobate walking according to the spirit of disobedience but god who is rich in mercy amen he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail-scarred hands what was those nail scars done by his love see his love is eternal i i just feel i got to just nail this down as we come to a close and as his love is eternal and do you realize eternal means without beginning without end but it also means without a break so if he if he ever loved you he always will love you and always has loved you then that means if your name was written on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world know what no matter what you did it never stopped god's love for you he may chasten you he may reprove you he may correct you as he does as a father does the son in whom he delighteth but it will never stop his love you cannot stop the love of god amen no wonder the apostle paul could speak by revelation at the end of romans 8 and say i am persuaded that neither depth nor height nor principality nor power nor persecution nor tribulation nor things present nor things to come nor anything shall be able to separate us from the love of god that's in christ jesus amen and when peter rejected christ three times and run away and says i'm going to go back to fishing i'm done with the message i'm totally done this message is falling apart at the seams the leader's been killed and everything's happening i'm just going fishing and forget about it now don't ever talk to me about this message ever again jesus comes yes and what does he say peter lovest thou me hallelujah he knew he did yes lord you know i love you peter lovett thou me wasn't a deep question was it peter do you understand the mysteries of the seven angels that are in my right hand and the seven seals and the seven church ages the seven vows and the seven plagues and the seven trumpets and all of those kind of things and how to place it can you draw me a timeline like some of us brother's canon can you place it all to you no he says peter do you love me do you love me peter lord you know i love you peter do you love me that was the question sometimes god has to keep coming back but don't you love me lord i'm going through all this but don't you love me lord i'm really suffering now but don't you love me lord i don't understand these things are happening but don't you love me lord there's so many things that are taking but don't you love me because i'll tell you what i sure love you hallelujah god speaks back he says i love you that's why my chasing is with nail scarred hands that's why my my yoke is easy and my burden is light brother branham goes sometimes the potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he might rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of love there is not and there cannot be hallelujah that's god the bride is his beloved the word beloved appears in lots of places in the bible a few times in many different books i think seven times in the book of romans but the place where it appears most is in the song solomon or the song of songs 26 times what is it think about it now song of solomon is something that we don't preach on a lot we don't talk about a lot you know it seems like almost this intimate personal relationship between a man and a woman there that that becomes so intimate they begin to describe i'll just say parts of the body that we don't like to touch don't like to talk about and as far as in the ministers and that sort of thing and i'm not going to go down that road but yet in the midst of it all god is describing a love that is so intimate and personal that he has for you that he's acquainted with every part of your life and he loves you he knows you're just a man he knows you're just a woman he knows exactly what you're going to go through he knows the mistakes you're going to make he knows your weaker parts he knows your hidden parts see when it talks about the intimacy of the body is talking about the parts what the bible says we clothe upon that receive more c more abundant honor because we're ashamed of them what is that there's areas of our life that we keep covered up there's areas of our life we don't want nobody to know about but god is saying in his love story i know all about them and i still love you hallelujah you are my beloved you are the one that i knew exactly what kind of a condition you went and you'd lay on your face and say lord i hate the way i am i hate them i have this weakness i hate god says i knew you had that and i loved you anyway amen god come down and say it doesn't matter it doesn't make no difference in a matter of fact it's because of those things that i bestow on you more abundant honor i bestow on you more abundant grace i bestow on you more abundant love because you are mine and no one else do i desire hallelujah so the bible records in solomon's he says the woman says i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine i am his and he is mine what a relationship she goes throughout the city she begins to wonder you know where have you seen him i i just want to be with him i don't really care what else is going on in the city i don't care what watch it is i don't care what's happening on the walls i don't care the people that are in the streets i don't care about anything else i just care about him there's something in my heart that says just give me more of jesus all i want to see is jesus and she loves his voice oh we've received his voice the voice of my beloved behold he quickly come he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills he's coming i've heard his voice it come in a message it told me he's coming he told me i'm in the midst of his coming the voice caused me to recognize he's coming he's leaping upon the mountains right now amen he's skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row and a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows he showeth himself through the lattice you know sometimes i can't see a clear vision of him but i know he's there i can hear his voice i look at him through the word i don't necessarily understand it all i don't see him quite clearly but i hear his voice he speaks to me from the word he makes known himself to me that's my beloved my beloved spake oh i love this part and i'm going to close on this my beloved spake and said unto me the words that we are waiting to hear the words that are laying right within the word and they're becoming louder and they're becoming louder and they're becoming louder like the voice on the mountain and the trumpet growing louder and louder a trumpet at the last trump growing louder and growing louder he says my beloved spake and he said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away what is that the voice of the resurrection arise lazarus we hadn't said lazarus everyone in the grave would have risen it's the same voice of our beloved that says rise up my love rise up my fair one and come away to the wedding supper come away to a feast with me hallelujah for lo the winter is past the rain is over hallelujah the hard season is done we're here amen the flowers are appear upon the earth the time of the singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land it says voice of the turtle but turtles don't have a voice it's actually turtledove the fig tree putteth forth her green figs what is that israel we see the time the season the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell and he says at the end of this arise my love my fair one come away hallelujah it was love the purity of it in god that made him slip the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace upon your finger before the foundation of the world he always knew that we were his and when you always know that somebody was yours you have grace for everything they go through sometimes god will reveal to one part of the couple the future marriage relationship before the other but when you know god has spoken to you you say i can wait god has spoken to me that one's mine i don't need to say nothing i don't need to push it all i got to do is wait for them to get a revelation amen and so is with god he slipped the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace on your finger when you come into this world as a child he says that one's mine that one's mine that one's mine you didn't understand it you went your way you followed the things of the world you pursued the lust of the flesh and the desire the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and all of those kind of things that you desired and you went off your own way but god didn't care there'll come a time that one's mine hallelujah they'll get the revelation they might not understand it right now they got spiritual amnesia and they might go through a lot of things they might even put themselves through things because i'm kind of i'm kind of wooing them i'm kind of pricking their heart like i did paul on the road on to damascus or even before the road to damascus i might have to knock them down like i did paul on the road to damascus and bring their attention to who they really are but they're mine and when they find out their mind amen then they will love my voice and now they'll begin to hear my voice that says through a messenger the voice the the wedding call the midnight call arise trim your lamps go yell to meet him amen i want to hear his voice i want to hear him say arise my love arise my fair one and come away as the musicians come let's stand to our feet then in the wedding supper of the lamb what do you have you don't have in order to satisfy his love you have love satisfied here we're united to the word and when the last member comes in will be caught out of here and the grace of god who is rich in mercy because of and in order to satisfy the great and intense and wonderful love wherewith he loved us did all this but then what is satisfaction when we get on the other side it will be won't just be love projected to an object it will be love satisfied we will be forever in his arms throughout all eternity oh saints it's a love story the and the and the more that he does in your life the more you realize how much he loves you you know i don't know if you know that song oh how he loves you and me he gave himself what more could he do you don't know it how many know it what's wrong all right some of you know it um uh let's try let's try it in uh i don't think c would be the right yes oh how he loves you and me he gave himself what more could he do how he loves you oh how he loves me oh how he loves you and me just like that let's say it again oh how he loves you and me he gave himself oh he gave himself what more could he do what more could he he do you oh how he loves me oh how we love you and me o say it again how he loves us oh how he loves himself he loves you oh how he loves me oh how we love hallelujah have you got the words there you didn't type them out amen i'm amazed that you love me isn't that the theme of our weekend lord i'm amazed that you love me i'm amazed through your precious and my sins they are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away give me the first first place without you i was covering up the secret tears yes look then one your day and the love on a hill called calvary set my spirit free now yes i was they're all washed away my sins are washed away lord you know the many times i've gone astray every time i pray no one else has ever cared for me yes lord hallelujah i'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow yes everything i'll ever do i oh that you love me i'm amazed through your precious we're all washed away but god you might have been at a point in your life there was one brother shared his testimony with me at breakfast you've been going through a lot of physical infirmities a lot of disruption in his life but god knew you needed this campaign you might have had trials you might have had issues you might have even been doing okay but god knew he wanted to meet you here god wanted to pull you aside so that he could tell you how much he loves you and don't ever fear what the devil will try and throw in your mind and bombard you with it's not about doctrine and it's not about understanding everything listen i don't understand everything matter of fact if you understood everything you wouldn't need faith you got this gospel is by faith but it's about being honest and being real with god being real not with me with god not your husband not your wife with god not the pastor not the church the deacons the trustees and musicians whatever it might be be real with god because god is real just say god i don't understand everything but if you'll make yourself real to me and if you'll show your love to me i give you my entire life we preached about the first day we talked about death and hell is all around you but god came in the midst of that and we love him anyway we talked about how that you know here we are in these last days god's given us his name and what's in a name and what it means to be his son and what it means to be a bride and all the things that go with us and what our attitude ought to be towards our inheritance and all the revelation that god's poured into our life it ought to be an extreme joy but then this morning just just to tie it together it is really all his love and because his love is all-powerful you couldn't resist it anyway it made the universe what made you think is not going to conquer you are you so tough that you can resist the love of god let me tell you something galaxies there's 100 billion galaxies and there's 10 billion stars in each galaxy and so there's a billion trillion stars out there and god made them all he was writing his word he was writing his love story and it tells a story in the heavens but the purpose of it is god's love and as his love did all that his love will conquer you if you just let it bow our heads together it's the last time we'll pray together here we are at the end of the service about to turn it back to brother ben close the meetings if there's anybody here still that would say oh god my heart's posse i don't know that i believe it but something inside is telling me i want it i want you to make yourself real to me i want you lord to do something for me it might not be at this meeting it might be in the days ahead but i want you to know lord i love you and i'll serve you every day of my life and i just welcome you to make yourself real to me in a way that you've never made yourself real to me before you might just want to slip up a hand to him i'm not even going to acknowledge those hands i'll just say lord knows whose hands are raised and whose isn't heavenly father
