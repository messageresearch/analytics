[28:17] trust that you've already invited him to
[28:19] your Pew Hallelujah if you haven't just
[28:22] invite him now amen and if we could turn
[28:25] in our scriptures now to John chapter 4
[28:28] amen versus one through the seven and
[28:31] then Hebrews 13 8.
[28:33] oh my I'm driving with this thing am I
[28:36] man technology has increased the tree of
[28:39] knowledge is growing
[28:41] oh my okay uh how do I do I just swipe
[28:45] to the side or the left or on I can see
[28:47] I can see all right man this is easy I
[28:51] could see Ben doing that the other day
[28:53] amen I want to speak tonight on a
[28:56] subject
[28:57] cold He'll Do It Again
[29:01] I just feel like preaching right now
[29:03] or just finishing and saying God you
[29:05] take over amen
[29:07] when therefore the Lord knew how the
[29:09] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[29:12] baptized more disciples than John
[29:14] though Jesus himself baptized not but as
[29:17] disciples
[29:18] he left Judea and departed again into
[29:21] Galilee and I love this and he must
[29:23] needs go through Samaria he had
[29:25] something on his mind there was a Divine
[29:27] compassion leading Hallelujah then
[29:30] cometh he to a city of Samaria of all
[29:33] places which is called saika near to the
[29:36] parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
[29:38] son Joseph and now Jacob's Well was
[29:41] there Jesus therefore being married with
[29:44] his journey set thus on the well and it
[29:47] was about the sixth hour
[29:49] and there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[29:52] draw water
[29:54] Oh my Jesus said unto her give me to
[29:57] drink yeah amen may the Lord add his
[29:59] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[30:00] may be seated
[30:01] oh Jesus help me Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus
[30:05] Christ the same yesterday
[30:08] today and forever and I just want to
[30:11] place emphasis on the same he's the same
[30:15] who believes he's the same so if he's
[30:17] the same tonight
[30:18] does that mean that he will do the same
[30:20] things if the same faith has is brought
[30:23] up to him
[30:24] amen amen so if Jesus Christ is the same
[30:27] yesterday today and forever then he will
[30:30] do the same things that he did back then
[30:31] oh yeah he'll do today the same things
[30:34] he did in the 50s he will do today the
[30:36] same things he did in the 60s he will do
[30:38] today the same things he did in the 90s
[30:41] in the 2000s and when this church was
[30:43] founded he will do today so wherever
[30:47] that last Milestone is in your life
[30:49] where God did something for you he will
[30:51] do it again today
[30:53] Hallelujah he's still the same he hasn't
[30:56] changed Hallelujah
[30:58] hey man I just want to get that straight
[31:00] here we'll do it again amen hallelujah
[31:03] you see now I I have no doubt in my mind
[31:06] that when Jesus began to uh talk to this
[31:09] woman at the well you know and he had
[31:10] gone to a woman who was of the least
[31:12] reputation a woman who had no reputation
[31:16] really among men and she wasn't even
[31:18] allowed to go to the well with all the
[31:20] women of the virgins and the woman of
[31:22] virtue so she was there in the heat of
[31:25] the day and she wasn't allowed to go
[31:27] where anyone else she was ostracized
[31:29] from society and she was a Samaria a
[31:32] place that was considered just ghastly
[31:34] in the sight of the Jews right so here
[31:36] is a place that was disdained it was had
[31:39] no reputation and the woman was the
[31:40] lowest person in that place we could say
[31:43] right and Jesus the Messiah chose her to
[31:47] be the first Gentile to reveal himself
[31:49] too
[31:50] amen why did he do this why would Jesus
[31:54] choose this woman I believe that Jesus
[31:57] doesn't make mistakes he's if the son of
[31:59] man does only that which he sees the
[32:01] father doing by Vision he was led to the
[32:04] woman of Samaria because he wanted to
[32:06] make a statement he wanted to make a
[32:09] statement that he's willing to go to the
[32:10] lowest people and do the greatest things
[32:12] amen because he wants to speak a message
[32:15] over the people so that you can have
[32:17] confidence today in 2023 that he'll do
[32:20] it again
[32:21] Hallelujah but I have no doubt in my
[32:23] mind that as that woman got a revelation
[32:26] of the Messiah after that long
[32:28] conversation that she had and her eyes
[32:31] came open and she was elated and her
[32:33] life was changed forever because she
[32:36] came in contact with the Messiah
[32:40] hallelujah amen and she went tearing up
[32:43] Samaria she went back to psycha she was
[32:46] excited she was so excited that she
[32:49] forgot about her water park she forgot
[32:51] about her past she forgot about
[32:53] everything that was going on behind her
[32:54] she forgot
[32:56] Hallelujah because there was such an
[32:58] impact Hallelujah she went tearing up
[33:01] those streets everybody knew everybody
[33:03] knew that the Messiah was here because
[33:06] he told her the things that was in her
[33:07] heart
[33:09] glory to God
[33:11] glory to his name
[33:13] Hallelujah he will do it again right so
[33:15] this is the thing now he was sending a
[33:17] message out because he knew that there
[33:19] was a lot of people in Israel in Samaria
[33:22] in the Gentile World in 2023 that needed
[33:26] to know that he no matter how far
[33:28] they've gone how far away how many
[33:30] troubles they do how many failures they
[33:32] have no matter what they go through no
[33:34] matter what their children go through
[33:35] all the Mind battles everything like
[33:37] that he wants to say that you're not
[33:39] past my judgment you're not past my line
[33:41] of Mercy I will come to you and I will
[33:44] do it again
[33:46] he's willing to do it again he needed to
[33:48] send a message because there was people
[33:50] there that was living in condemnation
[33:51] there was people in his time that were
[33:55] living in hopelessness and in that state
[33:58] of hopelessness it was easy for them to
[34:00] sin
[34:04] I'm feeling really nervous
[34:07] I feel like adrenaline
[34:10] oh man Hallelujah you Paul
[34:14] this is a two-way thing right there's
[34:17] two things I'm really relying on right
[34:18] now and one of them is the inspiration
[34:21] of the Holy Ghost
[34:22] and two is the faith of the people to
[34:25] pull amen and I'm having faith too
[34:27] because you know this the lord gave me
[34:29] this message
[34:30] and about two or three weeks ago
[34:34] and it just all downloaded like
[34:36] straight off and then
[34:39] and now I think man and I come to I
[34:42] think man I need this I need this is
[34:45] like for me
[34:46] you know like I don't know anyone that's
[34:48] preached right you're preaching you
[34:50] think man help me Lord Jesus help me I
[34:54] want to sit there and watch it because I
[34:57] need this
[34:59] yeah you know there's things that you
[35:01] this is why Jesus does these things so
[35:02] that we can have confidence that he'll
[35:04] do it again if he did it there he'll do
[35:06] it for you oh yeah and he will do it
[35:08] willingly and he wants to and he's just
[35:10] waiting
[35:11] just waiting on something he's just
[35:12] waiting on someone to pass off that
[35:14] crust of unbelief you know the disciples
[35:16] said walk with him that scene the dead
[35:18] raise the supernatural after
[35:19] Supernatural and he sent them and
[35:22] anointed them to cast out Devils
[35:23] cleansed lepers raise the dead heal the
[35:25] sick and preach the gospel to the poor
[35:26] right yeah yeah he sent them out and yet
[35:29] there was still a demon that they
[35:31] couldn't cast off
[35:32] oh
[35:33] and he says because you don't you're
[35:35] unbelief
[35:36] so these disciples who had seen it all
[35:38] and were anointed to do it there were
[35:40] still some things that were
[35:41] strongholding against them and he just
[35:43] went like this be gone or whatever he
[35:45] said and that thing was gone
[35:47] and he said the only way this one can
[35:50] come out is but by prayer and fasting
[35:51] that doesn't mean oh no there's a
[35:54] serious case that's fast and pray until
[35:56] it happens he lived in a state of Prayer
[35:59] he was anointed
[36:01] he was living in a state of able to
[36:03] deliver
[36:04] yeah and you can too
[36:07] Hallelujah none of us to have to live
[36:09] below privilege all that you see and all
[36:12] that you see him do he'll do it again
[36:13] and he's willing
[36:15] he's willing
[36:17] Hallelujah
[36:19] Hallelujah
[36:21] sometimes we just don't cross the cross
[36:23] the line between mercy and judgment or
[36:25] between we don't cross the line into a
[36:28] realm of of divine faith and sometimes
[36:30] we're just living a realm of the
[36:31] humanistic understanding in our thoughts
[36:34] they just stay on the Earth
[36:36] but we're called to live higher yeah
[36:39] amen
[36:40] do you believe it amen
[36:43] oh that's cold has that been in the
[36:45] freezer
[36:46] it's got some solidity in there
[36:49] that's probably how cold it was before
[36:50] the heaters went on in the church
[36:52] oh that's actually solid ice oh
[36:56] someone new eh someone was very
[36:59] thoughtful that I needed turbo into
[37:00] Cooling
[37:06] amen
[37:09] this woman
[37:11] she just
[37:13] have I read that
[37:18] I added sorry I'm just getting used to
[37:20] this new driving this car
[37:24] then Peter opened his mouth and said of
[37:26] a truth I perceive that God is no
[37:30] respecter of person that's right but in
[37:33] every nation he that feareth him or she
[37:35] that feareth him and worketh
[37:37] righteousness is accepted with him amen
[37:40] thank you now you cannot your
[37:42] righteousness is of filthy rags right so
[37:44] it's not you performing anything to
[37:46] achieve or to earn anything from him
[37:48] your righteousness is only in him amen
[37:51] and so what he's calling for is for you
[37:53] to approach him personally yeah that's
[37:55] true he's calling for you to make an
[37:57] approach to make a move
[37:58] yes and he cannot bypass your free moral
[38:01] agency but he will woo you he will pour
[38:03] His presence out in in your midst he
[38:05] will show you an example of someone else
[38:07] getting delivered because he knows that
[38:09] you need that because that will spark
[38:11] hope in your life
[38:13] so that you can have an expectation so
[38:15] that when you do read the scripture you
[38:17] can think in your mind maybe I can have
[38:19] that too yeah maybe and all of a sudden
[38:22] there's an atmosphere change in your
[38:24] mind and atmosphere changes in your in
[38:25] the way that you conduct yourself and
[38:27] your thought processes because now
[38:29] there's a glimmer of hope
[38:31] to know that God has no respecter of
[38:33] person's meaning that God is not
[38:34] respecting how great you are how little
[38:36] you are or whatever he's not he doesn't
[38:40] look at those things he's looking at you
[38:42] your reverence yeah see that fear is not
[38:46] to be afraid I'm scared that's just some
[38:49] humanistic idea no it's to have a
[38:52] reverential trust
[38:53] referencing the Lord to approach him
[38:56] reverently
[38:58] to approach him in a righteous way
[39:01] righteousness is following the patterns
[39:03] of scripture righteousness is
[39:05] approaching him in the right way and God
[39:08] and his great tender loving Mercy would
[39:11] create a way for us to approach him and
[39:14] not just create a way for us to approach
[39:16] him but preserve the way of approach
[39:19] to preserve a way and when man got so
[39:23] twisted up in all denominationalism and
[39:25] Catholicism and darkness and all these
[39:27] Eastern religions and everything like
[39:29] that and it blocked the way to God and
[39:31] everyone didn't know what to do
[39:33] God had to send a man Anointed with the
[39:36] spirit of us yeah oh yes so that he
[39:39] could re-establish the altar
[39:41] so that we could approach God in
[39:44] Simplicity I was talking to Josh the
[39:46] other day in the car and he was telling
[39:47] some of his friends the Simplicity of it
[39:50] of the message what it means and talking
[39:53] about this this approach and talking
[39:56] about you know what is it and do you
[39:59] need that for salvation
[40:01] do you need this is it something that's
[40:04] absolutely necessary the approach that
[40:06] is revealed in the message is all in the
[40:08] scripture right yeah it's all there yeah
[40:10] it's just tuning and calibrating our
[40:12] vision of the scripture so that we can
[40:14] approach God the way the apostles do to
[40:16] preach the message of Paul to live the
[40:18] message of Paul to approach God the way
[40:20] Paul approached him it's very simple and
[40:24] when you do that you will find them
[40:26] because you're approaching him in the
[40:28] same Faith you're taking God's provided
[40:30] way
[40:31] amen hallelujah Hallelujah
[40:35] that was free thank you Hallelujah
[40:41] Matthew 15 26 is that gone okay but he
[40:44] answered and said it is not meant to
[40:46] take the children's bed and cast it to
[40:48] dogs and she said truth Lord yet the
[40:51] dogs eat of the crumbs would fall from
[40:54] their masters table
[40:56] in Jesus answered and said unto a woman
[40:58] great is thy faith be it unto thee even
[41:01] as thou wilt
[41:03] and her daughter was made whole from
[41:05] that very hour
[41:06] so here now we have another Testament of
[41:10] the willingness of Jesus Christ to even
[41:12] go beyond who he was called to go to
[41:14] because his ministry wasn't to go to the
[41:16] Gentiles at that stage he was going to
[41:18] go to the Gentiles through the church he
[41:20] was going to unlock the kingdom of the
[41:22] of the gospel and the Holy Ghost through
[41:24] Peter right he go Peter got given the
[41:26] keys to the kingdom but yet Jesus would
[41:29] even if someone approached him with his
[41:31] reverence and righteousness and actually
[41:33] humble themselves under his mighty hand
[41:36] and really approach him in faith he will
[41:39] still deliver
[41:40] there is no way out of being delivered
[41:43] if you provide the righteous way that he
[41:47] is ordained for you to come amen At
[41:49] first she said Son of David Son of David
[41:51] he didn't even respond
[41:52] it wasn't the righteous approach it
[41:54] wasn't according to scripture she didn't
[41:55] know I'm a son of David she wasn't part
[41:57] of the Kingdom of Israel she was a
[41:58] gentile
[42:02] but when she approached them as Lord
[42:04] when she realized that she can trust
[42:07] somebody
[42:08] and she can open her heart to the living
[42:10] King who will never hurt her who will
[42:13] actually want to help her and she could
[42:15] approach him and then she could find
[42:16] that she would receive the mercy that
[42:18] she needed
[42:19] Hallelujah Jesus was saying
[42:22] speaking now words behind the words
[42:24] between the lines I am willing to help
[42:27] even the unhelpful unhelpless the
[42:30] helpless the Hopeless I am willing to
[42:33] take someone that is not even allotted
[42:34] to them and give them salvation and give
[42:37] them seal and Salvage them from the
[42:39] wreckage
[42:41] oh Jesus help me
[42:43] Hallelujah
[42:47] you see now what he was doing
[42:50] and I love this because God was sending
[42:53] a message
[42:54] out to the people of his of psycha
[42:57] sending a message out to Samaria sending
[43:00] a message back into Israel
[43:02] I'm willing
[43:04] if you approach me you're gonna get
[43:07] saved if you approach me you're going to
[43:10] get healed if you approach me you're
[43:13] going to have a life change if you come
[43:15] this provided way you're going to get
[43:18] what they got because I will do it again
[43:20] I am faithful to do it again I am
[43:23] faithful to keep the word he says
[43:26] this is faithful to his own word
[43:29] and so these ripples were going out
[43:31] through Israel and there was another
[43:32] woman and for the sake of this story I'm
[43:34] just going to call her Mary even though
[43:36] it doesn't name her but Mary's a good
[43:38] name and there's no one with a first
[43:40] name Mary in here I don't think so
[43:42] that's good
[43:43] so it doesn't look like I'm trying to
[43:45] you know
[43:47] pen out somebody but so Mary now now she
[43:51] Mary has lived a sinful life the Bible
[43:53] calls her a great sinner
[43:55] and and and and and she's lived sinful
[44:00] and she's caught up in the wrong things
[44:02] caught up in prostitution caught up in a
[44:05] sinful life that she cannot get out of
[44:07] and she's hopeless
[44:09] and she's just going about her life
[44:11] probably wondering whether she should
[44:14] kill herself or not because she can't
[44:15] get out of this and she's got pressure
[44:17] she has to perform she's got a client
[44:21] base she's got to do all these things
[44:22] and she cannot get out of it and then
[44:24] she sees there's no way out and in her
[44:26] mind she's just too far gone even God
[44:28] has forsaken her
[44:30] this is the this is what's going on in
[44:32] her life and she's this is going through
[44:35] and day in Day Out The Daily Grind no
[44:39] hope gone to the altar many times in the
[44:41] synagogue and the priests just don't
[44:43] even want to talk to her they're just
[44:45] she's just a lost cause maybe in the
[44:47] early days when she first started going
[44:49] off the rails they tried to help her and
[44:51] they tried to help her and she went to
[44:53] the altar she went to this church and
[44:55] that church and she went to this group
[44:56] and that religion and that whatever she
[44:58] went to and she just it was just getting
[44:59] worse and she was just going downhill
[45:02] and it was just becoming more and more
[45:04] hopeless and then hopelessness built on
[45:06] hopelessness until it was just dark and
[45:09] all she could do was what she was
[45:12] um locked in to do all the rest of her
[45:14] life what's the point in living would
[45:17] have been going through her mind many
[45:19] times
[45:20] and we're gonna call her Mary but then
[45:23] one day news spread around in her
[45:25] circles maybe that is a holy man in town
[45:29] yeah there's a holy man and he went to
[45:31] Samaria and she's like what maybe her
[45:33] friend came up to and said you know Mary
[45:36] I know that you're going you're not a
[45:38] religious woman I know that you're not
[45:40] really interested in these things even
[45:42] though deep down she really wanted
[45:44] something real you know she really
[45:46] wanted a real Deliverance she really
[45:47] wanted to be free she really wanted to
[45:49] live in the Commonwealth of God she
[45:50] really wanted to be a friend of God but
[45:53] she thought and the devil had always
[45:55] made it very clear to her that she had
[45:57] passed salvation she had passed the
[45:59] point of no return you know can you
[46:01] imagine thinking like that can you
[46:03] imagine being in that place where you
[46:04] think you've passed Mercy where you
[46:06] think you're in judgment and there's no
[46:08] way out and you've just gone too far and
[46:10] there's people that are like that today
[46:12] there's people that sit in message
[46:14] churches that think these things about
[46:15] themselves they believe the lie of the
[46:17] devil right
[46:19] Lord help me stop walking around the
[46:20] pulpit
[46:21] I don't know why I walk around the
[46:22] pulpit
[46:23] [Laughter]
[46:25] Hallelujah and so
[46:28] so now your friend comes to her and says
[46:30] Mary I know you're not like that you
[46:32] know but hey guess what I'm just so
[46:35] excited because this woman was also in a
[46:37] hopeless cycle but something was
[46:39] changing in her friend and so now she's
[46:42] telling Mary Mary
[46:44] there's a holy man that doesn't just sit
[46:47] in the synagogues and go to the king's
[46:48] palaces he's actually he went to Samaria
[46:52] yeah what Samaria yes he actually went
[46:55] to Samaria and guess what he went to the
[46:57] that low prostitute that you had heard
[46:59] of and he went and he actually revealed
[47:03] himself to her and Mary something
[47:05] started to happen in Mary when she began
[47:08] to hear news of a deliverer when she
[47:11] began to hear news of a god of Mercy
[47:14] when she began to hear news that a God
[47:16] that could deliver and a god of Mercy
[47:19] was willing to to go to the lowest of
[47:22] the low yeah that's one thing for the
[47:24] god of Mercy to go to the high priest
[47:26] and give the high priest a prophecy or
[47:28] or to go to a congregation full of
[47:31] devout players people that are in the
[47:33] synagogue but what about this holy man
[47:36] who has a renowned to do miracles to
[47:39] raise the dead to heal lepers
[47:43] and all of a sudden she's hearing not
[47:45] just that but he's going to these lowly
[47:47] people in the highways and byways and
[47:49] all of a sudden hope begins to Dawn and
[47:53] Mary and something changed in her life
[47:56] from that moment on a Divine influence
[47:59] started coming on her heart and and we
[48:02] call that Grace does anyone know Grace
[48:06] where one day a Divine influence begin
[48:08] to come on your heart
[48:10] and it started to move in your life
[48:13] even though you hadn't seen a God and a
[48:17] flesh or whatever but yet there was
[48:19] something working there was something
[48:21] beginning to stir and marry and so
[48:24] something happened in her from
[48:26] hopelessness to Hope yeah
[48:29] hope is a very powerful thing by the way
[48:31] don't diminish it it's actually one of
[48:34] the three things that is mentioned as
[48:36] the three main things to have hope faith
[48:39] and love right
[48:41] hope faith and love I mean if it's
[48:43] elevated to that Trinity you could say
[48:46] of the highest things then don't
[48:50] diminish it because the hope is an
[48:53] atmosphere of expectation anticipation
[48:56] pleasurable you have a and you you're
[48:59] expecting something and so all of a
[49:02] sudden now Mary had you know she she was
[49:06] still doing her thing she was still got
[49:08] a schedule right she's still got to go
[49:10] fulfill her job and she's got to go to
[49:13] do her things that she doesn't and and
[49:15] carry on the way that she's always done
[49:17] but something changed now
[49:20] now it's become a little bit harder to
[49:22] do it because now Mary's got hope
[49:26] now something changed he's like whoa
[49:28] actually maybe I'm a candidate can you
[49:31] imagine now going from no candidate no
[49:34] eligibility not able to get connected to
[49:37] this God no deliverance and all of a
[49:40] sudden the possibility that you could be
[49:42] delivered right
[49:44] that you could be healed that you could
[49:48] be eligible to be a friend of God that
[49:51] you that that this Messiah that God
[49:53] everyone was waiting for
[49:55] would actually be interested in you oh
[49:59] my Lord
[50:00] interested in Cara
[50:02] interested in Malachi interested in
[50:05] Maggie Hannah
[50:06] amen interested in Megan
[50:10] amen
[50:11] interested in Debbie
[50:13] interested
[50:15] very interested and we're eligible right
[50:17] yeah
[50:19] now all of a sudden the fact that you're
[50:21] eligible
[50:23] now she's hope begins to rise on her
[50:25] heart now there's an expectation starts
[50:27] to brew and she's now going and doing
[50:29] her job but it's a lot harder to do now
[50:32] sun is a lot harder to achieve it starts
[50:34] to become hard we're we're in that state
[50:37] of hopelessness it was easy
[50:39] yeah has anyone ever kind of gone and
[50:41] just you know you've lived well and then
[50:45] you just go make a mistake and you're
[50:46] like
[50:47] you get so down that you just make more
[50:49] mistakes
[50:50] you think well stuff everything I'm here
[50:52] now I'm just going
[50:54] and you you feel like you're done
[50:56] and you're in that moment of
[50:58] hopelessness what is that the devil
[51:00] wants to disconnect you
[51:04] from the Commonwealth of God
[51:06] and what happens is you just cross into
[51:08] that place and it's so bad and there's
[51:12] people that live in that place can you
[51:14] imagine living in that place of
[51:17] hopelessness living in that place where
[51:19] sin is easy
[51:20] living in that place where it's easy to
[51:22] unbelieve easy to say the wrong things
[51:25] easy
[51:27] to commit sin
[51:28] easy to commit adultery easy to look at
[51:31] that pornography
[51:33] it's hopeless but yet there is hope amen
[51:36] because if you're a Seed of Abraham
[51:38] right
[51:40] Abraham against hope believed in Hope
[51:43] amen so it was an anomaly it was like
[51:46] what do you call that paradox
[51:48] whatever you're saying he just said no
[51:50] yeah yeah I've got a promise yeah
[51:54] yeah and all of a sudden now here's Mary
[51:56] and something's starting to change you
[51:58] know there's like a graph now in their
[52:00] life and the ease of sin is starting to
[52:02] go down and now there's something else
[52:05] starting to rise in their life and she's
[52:07] got this Faith that's starting to brew
[52:08] in her heart and it's brewing and it's
[52:11] brewing and it's growing and it's
[52:12] growing and it's just becoming painful
[52:14] horrible
[52:18] all of a sudden there's these thoughts
[52:20] that are coming in her mind that's
[52:21] different from ever before all of a
[52:24] sudden there's a motive inside her
[52:26] to be pure yeah
[52:29] to be pure you know there's something
[52:32] purging inside oh my God has anyone ever
[52:36] been in that place all of a sudden
[52:38] something's changing in your life and
[52:40] all of a sudden you have a desire to be
[52:41] pure and you start to hate sin
[52:46] oh Jesus
[52:48] keep us there
[52:52] we are in a battle
[52:54] now I can tell you now as she was
[52:56] thinking that and I'm sure the moment
[52:58] she said anything
[53:01] that slimy Devil he's a real person
[53:04] don't ever diminish the devil to some
[53:06] ethereal mist or whatever he is a being
[53:09] and he's very smart yeah too smart for
[53:12] his own good
[53:13] and he began to Slither his way into her
[53:17] mind and start to say no
[53:19] not you Mary
[53:21] you're not worthy
[53:24] he doesn't even care about you you've
[53:26] gone too far and she would have gone up
[53:28] and then she would have gone down and
[53:30] she would have gone up and she would
[53:31] have gone down she would have had good
[53:32] days and bad days I don't know how long
[53:34] it was
[53:35] from the moment she heard
[53:37] Hallelujah you know there was another
[53:39] woman that heard one day her name was
[53:40] Rahab
[53:41] Rahab heard one day you know she had
[53:43] never seen anything but word got out
[53:45] that there was a God who was real a God
[53:48] who could deliver a God who was changing
[53:50] lives a God who was delivering people
[53:52] and fulfilling promises and getting rid
[53:55] of sin
[53:57] God just going on a rampage
[54:01] removing sin out of his land yeah
[54:04] oh God he's going on a rampage tonight
[54:07] to remove sin out of your life amen and
[54:10] he's angry at the Devil not at you
[54:13] hate the sin not the sinner
[54:17] and he's on a rampage to go and deliver
[54:19] and Rahab was like oh something happened
[54:22] in her there was representation and
[54:24] Rahab
[54:25] something in Rahab the word got to her
[54:28] ear and it shaked her rare eardrum and
[54:31] then it went down into her mind and then
[54:33] her mind started
[54:35] all the Cog started turning and then she
[54:38] just let that linger a little long and
[54:40] then it went down yeah oh my when it
[54:42] goes down Hallelujah just let the word
[54:45] linger a little while in your life men
[54:48] meditate on my word says the Lord
[54:50] Hallelujah meditate on scripture
[54:52] meditate on the Promises
[54:54] see what happens
[54:56] it'll begin to create a hope an
[54:58] expectation and life
[55:02] and then the impossible can take place
[55:04] then the Miracles can take place then
[55:06] the supernatural can take place because
[55:08] your mind becomes a meeting place
[55:12] [Music]
[55:13] because you're thinking on the right
[55:15] things you ain't sitting there watching
[55:17] YouTube going on Snapchat looking at
[55:20] naked things all those sort of dirty
[55:22] stuff and watching all that stuff you
[55:24] know you're actually meditating on
[55:26] something that can change your life
[55:28] you're meditating on something you'll
[55:30] stop you sleeping in church
[55:32] Hallelujah
[55:34] amen you're coming to the anointing and
[55:37] you'll be able to engage in the message
[55:40] you'll be able to engage in what's being
[55:42] preached amen you're able to draw for
[55:44] yourself the manner that you need
[55:46] because you've been meditating on the
[55:48] word there's an atmosphere in your mind
[55:50] and it's gone into your heart because it
[55:51] starts here it doesn't stay there it's
[55:53] got to go down there but what are you
[55:56] meditating on are you mad at the word
[55:58] the thought where does it come from just
[56:01] just think about that oh yeah where is
[56:04] that thought coming from that you've
[56:05] meditated on
[56:08] trace it back
[56:11] I'm from that's on that screen that
[56:13] you're watching every day
[56:15] where has the thought come from
[56:17] is it going to bring Faith
[56:19] or is it just going to fill your mind
[56:21] with information
[56:22] because it can do two things it can go
[56:24] the other way too right it can take you
[56:26] further away from God
[56:27] there's just so much stuff that we fill
[56:29] our minds with it just fills out mind
[56:31] with Mindless and very much useless
[56:34] information but it's like it's
[56:38] tantalizing you know it kind of helps us
[56:42] relax and all those things but it comes
[56:44] with a cost
[56:48] anyway
[56:52] Mary is just now move there's something
[56:56] moving in our life there's there's a
[56:58] hope that's beginning to come up in her
[57:00] life and she's and and and and sin
[57:03] becomes hard and she's now thinking
[57:05] about
[57:07] maybe he'll come to me and maybe just
[57:10] maybe
[57:11] she prayed for an opportunity
[57:13] has anyone prayed for an opportunity
[57:15] with God
[57:16] just thank God
[57:25] did it for a prostitute why don't you do
[57:28] it for me I've tried all my life to sit
[57:30] in a church be holy even when I don't
[57:32] want to be sometimes
[57:34] I've gone to church my parents have told
[57:36] me it's good I've heard same enough for
[57:38] sermon after sermon after sermon Jesus
[57:41] I don't understand it and all these
[57:43] things
[57:44] but then if you just
[57:46] she would have gone synagogue after
[57:47] synagogue after Synagogue Church after
[57:49] church convention camp
[57:52] she would have had roller coasters but
[57:54] never
[57:55] total Deliverance yeah
[57:58] but then
[57:59] there was a a
[58:01] dilemma of Hope in her life that this
[58:04] one went to a woman of Samaria another
[58:07] prostitute and then this one went this
[58:09] holy man this Messiah they say this
[58:11] Prophet this one that has Supernatural
[58:13] power
[58:15] that actually has results
[58:18] he's here tonight by the way amen he
[58:21] actually has results he can actually
[58:23] change lives I know because he did it to
[58:26] me if he can do it to me he'll do it
[58:29] again
[58:30] if he can do it for Dave he'll do it
[58:32] again if he could not for Ben he'll die
[58:35] again
[58:36] he can deliver from alcohol from drugs
[58:38] from pornography he can deliver from all
[58:41] those things if he can do it for us
[58:42] he'll do it again if he can deliver on a
[58:44] man from addictions to Cricket smoking

[58:56] to know that you can be delivered to
[58:58] life that you can be healed tonight that

[59:07] and you can be changed you can be set
[59:09] free and never ever struggle with that
[59:11] thing again never
[59:14] because he doesn't have the liver he
[59:17] totally delivers what he's looking for
[59:19] is a meeting place in your mind and then
[59:22] in your heart
[59:24] you say invite me
[59:26] have a right attitude of Hope
[59:29] imagined Mary we're just calling her
[59:31] Mary don't get me wrong I don't know
[59:33] what her name is but I like the name
[59:37] she's now praying I believe
[59:43] just maybe simple prayer
[59:45] and he heard that
[59:48] there was a seed inside her predestined
[59:51] yeah but spoke to the deep in him
[59:55] and it resonated
[59:57] Hallelujah
[59:59] like rehab
[1:00:01] resonated in her ears resonated in her
[1:00:04] mind resonated in her heart and then it
[1:00:07] resonated in her life
[1:00:09] hasn't resonated in your life as your
[1:00:11] life resonating
[1:00:12] of the word of God
[1:00:14] and he let the Prophecies of today
[1:00:16] are you vibrating are you playing out
[1:00:18] the music is your life song singing The
[1:00:21] End Time Is Here the Rapture is close

[1:00:26] of a going amen is that what your life
[1:00:30] is resonating
[1:00:32] in rehab she heard a sound of a going
[1:00:34] she heard a sound that maybe she could
[1:00:36] be delivered you know what God arranged
[1:00:39] that she would be delivered not just her
[1:00:41] but her whole house
[1:00:42] Hallelujah
[1:00:44] on the day of her Deliverance the D-Day
[1:00:46] of her sinful life you know there's an
[1:00:49] end to your sinful nature
[1:00:53] and do you know that's one final end
[1:00:55] right but there's also an end to
[1:00:57] settings
[1:00:59] there's an end to those things that are
[1:01:00] holding you back there's an end to and I
[1:01:03] say in my own life criticisms Hallelujah
[1:01:08] you know I'm a critical person on myself

[1:01:12] especially when I get really really worn
[1:01:14] out
[1:01:16] oh man
[1:01:18] but there's an end to that
[1:01:20] some things are so deep
[1:01:22] ly habitual nature not just they're not
[1:01:24] Devils or anything but they're just
[1:01:26] things that God needs to change
[1:01:28] all my habits
[1:01:30] mindsets family traits things that have
[1:01:32] locked out
[1:01:34] the word of God can divide Soul and
[1:01:36] Spirit don't you think the word of God
[1:01:38] can put your soul in preeminence over
[1:01:39] those things so that you can have
[1:01:41] victory over those things yeah amen real
[1:01:43] victory life changing
[1:01:47] real true Victory Hallelujah he's here

[1:01:56] mighty Angel With The Sword in his hand
[1:01:59] giving the the word to Joshua and the
[1:02:02] Army and they followed his leading and

[1:02:26] opportunity she got a sure token

[1:02:33] that I know that I know

[1:02:40] had faith in the finished work but this
[1:02:43] Captain who came down to deliver she had
[1:02:45] believed him and God respected that
[1:02:49] there and watched her life her old life
[1:02:53] she watched it disappear every last
[1:02:56] stinking sinful thing
[1:03:01] she didn't lift a finger she just stood
[1:03:05] there believing maybe worshiping
[1:03:07] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] and watch the word of that Mighty
[1:03:12] Captain who'd come into her land into
[1:03:14] that place and deliver her from her old
[1:03:17] life until she stood there and I say
[1:03:20] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:03:22] Lord
[1:03:22] watch what he can do because if he would
[1:03:25] do it for her he'll do it for you he'll
[1:03:27] do it for your family they're done for
[1:03:29] your children
[1:03:30] mean never give up has been said on
[1:03:33] Sunday never never give up
[1:03:35] oh my I've got to go to this picture
[1:03:40] rehab
[1:03:42] maybe it was all chaotic
[1:03:44] I'm sure it was oh yes if a whole city
[1:03:46] walls is falling around you it's not
[1:03:48] going to be the most librarious
[1:03:51] it's going to be pretty carnal Carnage
[1:03:54] yeah screaming
[1:03:57] those devils
[1:03:59] screaming
[1:04:01] all those Devils that held her and said
[1:04:04] Foster
[1:04:06] in those ways
[1:04:08] screaming delivered
[1:04:11] and she stands there and she's praying
[1:04:14] oh God the god of Abraham Isaac and
[1:04:17] Jacob oh Lord you are truly real now I
[1:04:21] know now let's come to my house now I
[1:04:24] can experience in my house and in my
[1:04:26] life I can see total Deliverance all
[1:04:28] around me
[1:04:30] Hallelujah
[1:04:32] all the dust and the shaking and the
[1:04:35] groaning and the screaming and all the
[1:04:38] Deliverance Deliverance is not normally
[1:04:40] a quiet thing
[1:04:41] Deliverance can be a very loud noisy
[1:04:44] time it doesn't have to be but it can be
[1:04:47] and in rahab's time it was a real noisy
[1:04:49] time at Deliverance
[1:04:53] and after it all and maybe the dust had
[1:04:56] begun to settle
[1:05:04] looks around
[1:05:05] Freedom she looks to the right Freedom
[1:05:08] she looks to the left freedom
[1:05:10] totally delivered
[1:05:13] she gets married to the captain
[1:05:14] Hallelujah and at the wedding when they
[1:05:17] said is there anybody here that can
[1:05:19] testify why raheim can't marry the
[1:05:20] captain of Israel army yup
[1:05:24] and they're looking around where are you
[1:05:28] accused is your accusers
[1:05:30] and she says there aren't any they're
[1:05:33] all gone they're all gone I got
[1:05:35] delivered that's how God delivers and if
[1:05:37] he'll do it for Ray have he'll do it for
[1:05:38] you Hallelujah
[1:05:40] he'll do it for me
[1:05:42] Hallelujah
[1:05:44] because he loves to do that and so Mary
[1:05:47] oh my I better look at the time I'm
[1:05:50] having too much of a good time
[1:05:52] right you know time just oh there's a
[1:05:54] clock
[1:05:55] yes
[1:05:57] praise God I can now I've just got to
[1:05:59] remember it's there
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:02] I'm gonna I'm just going to I'm gonna
[1:06:05] get to the scripture here
[1:06:08] and I have to get to this I'm gonna work
[1:06:10] through
[1:06:11] says here beloved now we're the sons of
[1:06:14] God and it does not yet appear what we
[1:06:16] shall be but we know that when he shall
[1:06:19] appear we shall be like him because
[1:06:21] we're in the eighth time of the
[1:06:22] appearing
[1:06:23] the time of the appearing
[1:06:25] where God would reveal himself in his
[1:06:27] word
[1:06:28] and totally reveal everything that he is
[1:06:31] and all his intentions and expose the
[1:06:33] devil and all his intentions all his
[1:06:35] plans everything right amen and then he
[1:06:37] would make that flesh and live it out
[1:06:39] through a people right so the appearing
[1:06:41] we're in the age okay we've established
[1:06:43] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:06:46] like him for we shall see him as he is
[1:06:48] so here's this Revelation now just like
[1:06:51] Mary was getting a revelation you know
[1:06:53] like she was he had appeared in that
[1:06:55] generation no physically now it is
[1:06:57] appearing physically the Lamb of God to
[1:06:59] take away the sins of the world was
[1:07:00] appearing the Messiah and now she's
[1:07:02] hearing about it now hope has started to
[1:07:04] happen in her heart so now she's
[1:07:07] beginning to purify herself because
[1:07:09] there's a motive for it she's preparing
[1:07:11] for a wedding day she's preparing for
[1:07:14] something because there's an
[1:07:15] anticipation in her life it's bringing a
[1:07:17] joy in her heart that she's never known
[1:07:20] and until this happens to you there is a
[1:07:23] joy that's available that you've never
[1:07:25] known
[1:07:26] but I believe I'm looking at people that
[1:07:28] are walking in this Joy I believe I'm
[1:07:30] looking and preaching to a people that
[1:07:31] know this joy that know what it's like
[1:07:34] to be enjoyed to know what it's like to
[1:07:36] be really truly happy
[1:07:38] and stay happy
[1:07:40] Hallelujah stay happy in the storm stay
[1:07:43] happy on the mountain stay happy in the
[1:07:45] valley stay happy in the trials I should
[1:07:47] say joyous right amen happiness can be
[1:07:49] based on circumstance but I'm just going
[1:07:51] to call it Joy
[1:07:53] Joy is a very powerful thing
[1:07:59] for we shall sin as he is and then
[1:08:02] there's and every man that has this hope
[1:08:03] in him hope
[1:08:05] purifieth himself even as he is pure
[1:08:09] so there's this motive happening in Mary
[1:08:11] she's now becoming very hard and very
[1:08:15] difficult for her she's getting brought
[1:08:16] to an ultimatum she's getting brought to
[1:08:19] a place in her life which a decision has
[1:08:21] to be made you know she's got she's
[1:08:24] coming to a point where she's got to
[1:08:25] cross over
[1:08:26] from sin into righteousness
[1:08:29] and sometimes that can be a very
[1:08:31] tumultuous time oh yeah it was for me it
[1:08:34] took about nine months for me because
[1:08:36] you know this is just everyone's
[1:08:37] different but when it happened it really
[1:08:39] really happened
[1:08:42] and when it happened it really happened
[1:08:46] oh my
[1:08:47] it happened so good
[1:08:49] it happened so thoroughly it happened so
[1:08:52] definitely
[1:08:54] that from that moment from that time
[1:08:56] there was no more desire for alcohol
[1:08:59] drugs and no more desire just gone all I
[1:09:02] wanted was to sit and read my Bible
[1:09:05] and I was a very social person I was out
[1:09:08] there partying all the time
[1:09:10] sudden I had
[1:09:13] I had completely changed
[1:09:15] but came and he brought substance
[1:09:19] I had that hope
[1:09:21] I was in a season of because I knew I
[1:09:23] was man it was a joyful time but yet I
[1:09:25] was running
[1:09:26] and I was in and out and just going
[1:09:28] through it and sin was becoming very
[1:09:30] difficult
[1:09:32] and and right and there was something in
[1:09:33] me I started listening to the rights of
[1:09:35] music
[1:09:36] I started watching the right things you
[1:09:38] know and I was still going out there
[1:09:39] still having a bit of this and that but
[1:09:41] I but something was changing there was a
[1:09:45] hope inside me there was a meeting place
[1:09:47] inside me where God could come
[1:09:50] he began to change something in me and
[1:09:53] so there was an opportunity
[1:09:55] opportunity everyone say opportunity
[1:09:57] opportunity there was an opportunity for
[1:10:00] God to work because there was a faith
[1:10:02] inside me there was a hope inside me
[1:10:06] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:10:09] for Hallelujah
[1:10:11] so it goes from hoping
[1:10:15] to substance
[1:10:17] but you can't make the substance
[1:10:19] it's God that makes the substance
[1:10:22] God brings substance to Hope
[1:10:27] but hope is an atmosphere for God to use
[1:10:31] because now you're drawing you're
[1:10:33] pulling you're anticipating You're
[1:10:34] Expecting yeah
[1:10:36] you've got an expectation I trust you've
[1:10:38] got an expectation and you have
[1:10:41] expectation you see something that you
[1:10:42] know and you need or it's for you and
[1:10:44] you and you'll get you've got an
[1:10:45] expectation you are believing right
[1:10:48] you're anticipating it's going to be for
[1:10:51] me and I've seen him do it for them and
[1:10:52] he'll do it again
[1:10:54] I've seen him do it for Rahab and he'll
[1:10:55] do it for me I've seen him do it for the
[1:10:58] maniac of gaddara who was so dumb to
[1:11:00] Demons if he could do that for him he'll
[1:11:03] do it for me or do it for that demon
[1:11:04] possessed man he'll do it for whoever
[1:11:07] if you've got a devil in you and you
[1:11:09] can't get rid of it he'll do it for you
[1:11:12] because he did it for the maniac gadara
[1:11:14] he did it for all the demon-possessed he
[1:11:16] even schizophrenic
[1:11:20] demons that used to cast People Into the
[1:11:22] Fire
[1:11:23] and they couldn't stop it and have
[1:11:24] seizures and all sorts of crazy things
[1:11:27] yeah
[1:11:28] and he would deliver them
[1:11:30] if he did it for them he'll do it for
[1:11:31] you if he did it for them he'll do it
[1:11:34] for your friend he'll do it for those
[1:11:35] ones that you're caring for
[1:11:37] because it's still the same
[1:11:44] Prophet says this in the third step how
[1:11:46] can two walk together lest they be
[1:11:48] agreed
[1:11:49] light and dark cut Fellowship together
[1:11:51] when light comes in
[1:11:53] dark goes out so this is what's
[1:11:55] happening in Mary's Life Light is
[1:11:57] beginning to come in because now she's
[1:11:59] got a hope now hopelessness is being
[1:12:02] destroyed now it's becoming hard for her
[1:12:04] to sin now she's in a straight
[1:12:06] betwixture too because what's happening
[1:12:08] is light's coming in and dark is going
[1:12:10] out the most powerful is light you can't
[1:12:13] put light out with duck
[1:12:15] anyone find me a dark torch and you
[1:12:18] shine it in the room and it shines
[1:12:19] Darkness you can't do it light is far
[1:12:22] more powerful than
[1:12:23] that and God is light Hallelujah that's
[1:12:26] why he just shows it in nature right
[1:12:27] that he is like Jesus says I am the
[1:12:30] light of the world you can't put me out
[1:12:33] you just if that was one thing that you
[1:12:36] can get you can't put Jesus out you
[1:12:39] can't put him out he's inextinguishable
[1:12:43] Hallelujah and if you let him shine in
[1:12:45] your mind he'll begin to expel the
[1:12:47] darkness
[1:12:49] he'll expel those things that you're
[1:12:51] struggling with
[1:12:52] he'll deliver he'll shine light on it
[1:12:54] he'll shine light so well that he'll
[1:12:56] show you where it came from
[1:12:57] and then the devil's exposed sometimes
[1:13:00] you don't know why you're struggling
[1:13:01] with something and you need to know
[1:13:02] where it came from
[1:13:03] actually you should know where that's
[1:13:05] the key to Deliverance
[1:13:07] as Discerning discernment for the Lord
[1:13:10] to discern that issue and deliver you
[1:13:12] and heal you and set you free and the
[1:13:15] Holy Ghost comes down and in prayer and
[1:13:17] in the word and you can be sitting in
[1:13:19] the church and the Lord begins to preach
[1:13:21] don't Pitchfork that if it's for you and
[1:13:22] it's exposing something and it hurts
[1:13:24] take it amen don't just you know pride
[1:13:29] is such an evil thing it makes you miss
[1:13:31] out your your your deliverance it makes
[1:13:33] you miss out on that blessing that God
[1:13:35] wants to give you
[1:13:39] Hallelujah
[1:13:44] you know
[1:13:49] Mary
[1:13:51] and Israel
[1:13:52] and in our lives there's things that
[1:13:55] sometimes take ages
[1:13:56] and we think that oh wow
[1:13:59] it's just taking too long
[1:14:01] but there's people that wait for
[1:14:03] thousands of years
[1:14:05] yeah and when I was in Israel
[1:14:08] my goodness you know this what you can
[1:14:11] see here
[1:14:12] this is the Western Wall and it's the
[1:14:15] closest that Israelites can pray to the
[1:14:18] holy of holies where the temple once
[1:14:20] stood that's why it's so popular
[1:14:22] that's why they go there those blocks
[1:14:25] that those guys are leaning up against
[1:14:26] are slick with tears
[1:14:29] they're slick with crying tears they rub
[1:14:33] them they just scream out to God
[1:14:36] and they cry and if you look closely you
[1:14:40] probably can't see it from there I
[1:14:42] didn't think of that but there's
[1:14:43] actually stuffed into every crack
[1:14:45] there's thousands of little folded up
[1:14:47] notes that they've they've sent to God
[1:14:50] and children go there and as you can see
[1:14:53] on the left hand side there's that's
[1:14:55] like you know there's a lot of
[1:14:57] enthusiasm there's a lot of motivation
[1:14:59] there there's a lot of perseverance
[1:15:01] there these people have been waiting for
[1:15:04] thousands of years for their Messiah
[1:15:05] because their forefathers rejected them
[1:15:08] yeah their forefathers rejected Jesus
[1:15:11] Christ and the result is what you've
[1:15:14] seen Israel go through they got kicked
[1:15:16] out of Jerusalem they went scattered
[1:15:18] through the world they were served with
[1:15:20] the silver vanity they they took over
[1:15:23] the world because they were they had The
[1:15:24] Blessing of Abraham on them naturally
[1:15:26] speaking and they've now own all the
[1:15:28] money and they they they're all those
[1:15:30] big families of money all that stuff
[1:15:32] right but yet there's still a people
[1:15:33] that are really spiritual
[1:15:35] and there's at 144 000 people Jews that
[1:15:39] are waiting for their Messiah that are
[1:15:40] really got faith that are really
[1:15:42] believing and they've been believing for
[1:15:44] hundreds and hundreds of years and they
[1:15:46] just keep going back and they just keep
[1:15:48] going back and I'm calling you the army
[1:15:50] of Jesus Christ don't give up

[1:15:56] up on your deliverance don't give up on
[1:15:58] that Pacific and getting deleted out of
[1:16:00] your life because God is able and he's
[1:16:02] willing if he did it for them he'll do
[1:16:04] it again and these people here that are
[1:16:06] at that wall they believe that he'll do
[1:16:08] it again they always get the promises in
[1:16:10] front of them and they recite them and
[1:16:12] they recite them have you seen them
[1:16:13] they're like this have you seen them do
[1:16:15] this oh they are so desperate

[1:16:28] you're soft
[1:16:29] sorry but I'm being honest soft new
[1:16:32] zealanders
[1:16:34] the devil wants to reduce you to a kiwi
[1:16:36] with no wings so all you do is Sniff and
[1:16:38] pick out dirt out of the ground that's
[1:16:40] what he wants to do but that's why you
[1:16:42] hear the word dying down that's why you
[1:16:44] listen to sermons that's why you come to
[1:16:46] church because you're being raised up
[1:16:48] from kiwi status two
[1:16:52] two a praise
[1:16:55] he wants to bring you in the air he
[1:16:59] doesn't want you to be on the ground he
[1:17:01] doesn't want you to be comforted by the
[1:17:04] world he wants to be your comforter and
[1:17:06] the comforter is an eagle
[1:17:08] so your comfort's in the sky that's real
[1:17:11] Comfort not the comfort in the ground
[1:17:13] not comfort in the dirt with your that
[1:17:16] long beak that the devil wants to give
[1:17:17] you not a curved one either a big long
[1:17:20] skinny one that puts in the
[1:17:24] you know people say sometimes to me
[1:17:26] you're a key I said no all right no kiwi
[1:17:28] no way
[1:17:31] I will not identify with that stinking
[1:17:34] flightless bird what a silly thing to
[1:17:36] have as a country mascot sorry New
[1:17:38] Zealand but my goodness amen oh God help
[1:17:41] me
[1:17:44] give me that perseverance let me just
[1:17:46] keep holding on I will not give up amen
[1:17:49] hallelujah that's so here now I'm
[1:17:52] finishing on this help me Jesus this is
[1:17:54] the finishing point
[1:17:57] his Mary
[1:17:59] and it's not come to a climax
[1:18:01] it's not so hard and it's so it's just
[1:18:04] chewing in here and it's just the
[1:18:06] desperation and she's been believing and
[1:18:09] maybe this she's being stirred more
[1:18:11] today she got up it's been maybe a few
[1:18:13] months since she heard and it's just
[1:18:16] been brewing but then something was
[1:18:18] different this day something inside her
[1:18:20] was telling her today this is your last
[1:18:23] day here of doing these things
[1:18:26] she doesn't know why but something
[1:18:28] inside is saying this is the last time
[1:18:30] that you will suffer under this
[1:18:32] Taskmaster
[1:18:33] this is the last time that you'll do the
[1:18:36] prostitution this is the last time that
[1:18:38] you will suffer under Satan's
[1:18:41] something's changing and maybe it's
[1:18:43] because the Messiah was coming up the
[1:18:46] road and that presence that precedes him
[1:18:48] just begin to brood and it begins to
[1:18:51] surround that area I would I believe
[1:18:54] that when he was walking
[1:18:55] that there was a presence around him and
[1:18:59] I believe that for the Alex seed that
[1:19:00] was there they probably there was
[1:19:02] probably about a kilometer of presence
[1:19:04] that they could begin to sense when he
[1:19:08] is now
[1:19:12] something began to stir in her and
[1:19:16] and from her last client Hallelujah
[1:19:20] there's a last time there's a DNA for
[1:19:22] sin there's a D-Day for those specific
[1:19:24] things in your life make it tonight make
[1:19:26] it now God is a god of Deliverance if he
[1:19:29] doesn't for her he'll do it for you this
[1:19:31] woman was riddled with sin she was stuck
[1:19:33] she couldn't get out of it
[1:19:35] she was stuck
[1:19:36] so stuck in the devil always told her uh
[1:19:38] you can live a bit it's okay God's grace
[1:19:41] is sufficient
[1:19:45] God doesn't want you to live with it God
[1:19:48] doesn't want you to live under your
[1:19:50] privilege he wants you to live in the
[1:19:51] Heavenly he wants you to find comfort in
[1:19:54] the sky
[1:19:55] soaring with the ego of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:58] Hallelujah
[1:19:59] so here's Mary and she's walking from
[1:20:01] her last client and all of a sudden she
[1:20:04] hears a commotion down at Simon the
[1:20:06] Pharisees
[1:20:07] Hallelujah she hears a commotion she
[1:20:09] knows Simon the Pharisees she knows all
[1:20:11] those up and UPS because some of them
[1:20:13] are her clients
[1:20:14] so and they're secret clients and I'll
[1:20:16] tell you what if you'll ever think that
[1:20:18] those Pharisees were all real holy a lot
[1:20:20] of them were dark Sinners Jesus even
[1:20:23] said to them whoa unto you squads
[1:20:25] Pharisees lawyers all of those people
[1:20:27] you'd tell them all to do all these
[1:20:30] people to do all the stuff he put them
[1:20:31] under bondage but you don't even keep it
[1:20:33] yeah telling them they're vile Sinners
[1:20:35] and so here she is and she hears maybe
[1:20:38] she's walking down Hallelujah Avenue and
[1:20:40] here's Simon the Pharisees house Berg
[1:20:42] nice house with Steeples and all that
[1:20:44] stuff and now she says oh what's going
[1:20:46] on over assignments and she's like oh
[1:20:48] okay well there's John and there's
[1:20:50] buttermaus and there's this one and
[1:20:52] whatever this Caiaphas oh my they're all
[1:20:56] going I wonder what's happening oh and
[1:20:58] she stopped and she can see him and she
[1:21:01] sees the Messiah and the messiah's
[1:21:03] coming and she's like wow this is
[1:21:06] different
[1:21:07] different about him Hallelujah and so
[1:21:10] something stirs in her heart and she
[1:21:12] sees them lining up at Simon the
[1:21:14] Pharisees house and she's and there and
[1:21:17] she sees the foot wash flunkies and all
[1:21:19] the Entourage that they get as the
[1:21:21] dignitaries they roll out the carpets
[1:21:23] they invite them from their horse
[1:21:25] chariots and and they take off these
[1:21:27] people to take off this robe and this
[1:21:30] one cleans the takes off the shoes and
[1:21:32] washes the feet and puts on uh the
[1:21:36] slippers and anoints them with oil and
[1:21:38] then they come to the host Simon and he
[1:21:40] kisses them
[1:21:41] welcome you've got your garment you're
[1:21:44] clean you smell nice and she's thinking
[1:21:47] oh isn't it wonderful they kind of give
[1:21:49] honor and glory to this man that I've
[1:21:51] been waiting to see or how can I see him
[1:21:53] I know that I could probably get in
[1:21:55] there because I know all those things
[1:21:56] maybe the that footwash flunkies see me
[1:21:58] go past them a few times
[1:22:01] and so she's thinking oh I
[1:22:04] was going there but she's standing afar
[1:22:06] off she's just just a couple a block
[1:22:08] away but she's looking and she's like
[1:22:10] man they're gonna honor him they're
[1:22:12] going to give him what he deserves oh I
[1:22:14] can't wait to see how they're gonna just
[1:22:16] fall down and worship this holy Messiah
[1:22:19] and then they come he comes up and he's
[1:22:21] in the line and he walks up and the foot
[1:22:23] wash flunky looks at him looks over at
[1:22:25] Simon and Simon Says
[1:22:28] and he goes and he looks back at Jesus
[1:22:30] and he says
[1:22:31] going yeah and this woman
[1:22:34] she's like

[1:46:56] and just speak Mercy

[1:47:34] would be no pastors there would be no
[1:47:36] preachers there would be no anything no
[1:47:38] gifts nothing would operate if
[1:47:40] condemnation disabled us if we could be
[1:47:43] condemned but there is no condemnation
[1:47:45] to them which are in Christ Jesus and

[1:47:49] spirit
