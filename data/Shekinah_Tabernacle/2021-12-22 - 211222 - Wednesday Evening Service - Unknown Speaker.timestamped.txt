[26:56] this evening Lord because we've desired
[26:59] to put you first Lord we've decided
[27:01] desire to forsake all and follow you I
[27:04] believe I'm standing amongst
[27:06] Sons and Daughters of God Lord that have
[27:08] that have surrendered their life to you
[27:09] that have paid the price Lord that have
[27:11] not put anything else before you Lord

[27:18] sought and they're found Lord Jesus say

[27:40] of kings and Lord of lords Lord it would
[27:43] be such a wicked thing if we didn't know
[27:45] that Lord if we didn't understand that
[27:46] and we just went about
[27:48] going through this life without
[27:49] acknowledging you Lord but it's by your

[28:35] I just want to um I can drive this from
[28:37] here
[28:39] let's I will go to um we're going to
[28:41] read from X
[28:43] 16 30. how are you all this evening you
[28:46] good
[28:47] yeah good you had a good day
[28:50] yeah yeah you awake are you you see I I
[28:52] was in Camp and spirit so I watched the
[28:54] services I was there but um
[28:57] my body didn't pay a price
[29:00] but I I thought you know a lot of the
[29:02] Brethren may be quite tired you maybe
[29:04] some of you drove back yesterday some on
[29:06] Monday I think by the Empire got back I
[29:07] saw you Sunday night maybe one or two in
[29:10] the morning or something yeah man
[29:12] and then different ones were sort of
[29:14] trickling back so
[29:17] um it's okay to be tired but not tonight
[29:20] no look hey that we understand but I
[29:23] think it's a it's a you're here because
[29:25] you love the Lord
[29:27] and God will reward you you know we
[29:29] sometimes think God is this God that
[29:30] doesn't really see these things but he
[29:31] sees them he sees it when you're tired
[29:33] and you carry on anyway he sees it amen
[29:36] let's just read
[29:38] acts 16 Verse 30 says this is we're
[29:41] cutting into the story of Paul and the
[29:43] the prison
[29:46] and went after all the chains broke but
[29:47] we're just going to start from here and
[29:48] brought them out and said this is the
[29:50] Jailer talking to Paul and said sirs
[29:52] what must I do to be saved and they said
[29:54] this is Paul and Silas their belief on
[29:56] the Lord Jesus Christ and now shall be
[29:58] saved and thy house and they spake unto
[30:01] him the word of the Lord
[30:02] and to all that were in his house praise
[30:04] the Lord may God bless his word you can
[30:06] take your seats
[30:07] um this evening
[30:09] now the thought that I've got to speak
[30:12] about this evening is not a new thought
[30:13] and it's not going to be something that
[30:15] you don't already know
[30:18] there are sometimes when I may think I
[30:21] speak something that maybe you haven't
[30:22] heard but that's not tonight
[30:23] is just a simple one but it's a very
[30:26] very important one because it affects
[30:28] all of us
[30:29] probably to our core this concept here
[30:33] because you know the most beautiful
[30:35] thing the most precious thing in this
[30:37] world is the Lord and the second most
[30:38] beautiful thing are people and then
[30:41] there's the people that are close to us
[30:42] that mean more to us
[30:45] and this is dealing with that those
[30:47] people and so I think if you had to give
[30:50] up
[30:50] a lot of things in life maybe you had to
[30:52] slowly offload things that you own
[30:54] things that you wanted to wanted to um
[30:57] possess
[30:59] I think you're a family member would
[31:01] probably go after you would give up
[31:04] a piano you would probably give up a
[31:06] piano first and you'd keep your brother
[31:08] or your mother
[31:09] yeah
[31:11] you're probably empty your bank account
[31:13] first before you gave one of them up
[31:15] you know if you really in the core of
[31:18] you you'd for me I'd give up everything
[31:20] and that would be the last thing that I
[31:21] would give up and I would give up myself
[31:23] before them
[31:24] and that's what the Lord did for us so
[31:26] this is a this subject I think is a very
[31:27] important subject and
[31:31] I'm I'm going to try and more teach
[31:33] rather than preach because it's an
[31:35] exciting thing to preach about but
[31:37] sometimes when we preach we miss the
[31:38] just teaching and talking about it
[31:40] because it's something that I think is
[31:41] as a fundamental belief for it for a
[31:44] fellowship that everyone
[31:46] understands this concept and and is on
[31:49] board with it because it affects all of
[31:51] us this this concept of me and my house
[31:53] and and what we are able to possess
[31:56] what that means me and my house now this
[31:58] is this is pertaining to Salvation and
[32:00] this basically what I'm going to be
[32:02] talking about is is there is one faith
[32:05] that we have for ourselves initially for
[32:06] our own salvation
[32:08] and then we are given opportunity
[32:11] if we want to possess it which we all do
[32:13] that we can apply that same Faith to our
[32:16] house whatever that might be and they
[32:19] can receive the same salvation that we
[32:21] receive based on our faith
[32:24] well that sounds like a big big
[32:26] subject or a big matter but that's
[32:29] actually the truth our faith can save
[32:31] someone else
[32:32] not that we can save them but our faith
[32:35] in the Lord can cause them to come to
[32:37] Salvation
[32:38] okay and and we need somewhere in the
[32:41] Bible to base this belief on like we I
[32:43] can't just come out and say to you oh
[32:44] this is this is the way that it works
[32:46] you know and it's just that you know we
[32:48] have to have a as Believers we have to
[32:51] have a reference point in the word of
[32:52] God somewhere where we can say okay from
[32:54] this example here this is why I believe
[32:56] that well from this word here it has to
[32:59] be somewhere I can't just come and say
[33:00] it and then because when you go through
[33:02] a tough time
[33:03] Where Are You Gonna
[33:05] anchor it too you have to have some
[33:06] point where this thing gets anchored
[33:08] onto so the first thing I want to show
[33:10] you was we're about this this where do
[33:13] we put the anchor what part of the word
[33:15] of God do we put that onto now
[33:18] this is an interesting concept I'm going
[33:20] to go through four examples first just
[33:22] to say we understand this is how we get
[33:24] to this uh belief as a believer
[33:28] you see because that's because we are
[33:29] believers and so we see the word of God
[33:31] and then we believe it that it's true
[33:34] and then we anchor onto that and our
[33:35] life can be built on that okay
[33:37] this is an interesting place that we
[33:39] anchor this one to because essentially
[33:40] we are anchoring this onto a I would say
[33:44] a private conversation that happened
[33:45] between Paul and a jailer
[33:48] about two thousand years ago
[33:51] they had a private conversation
[33:53] that Paul spoke to another man and said
[33:57] the the Jailer asked Paul sirs what must
[34:00] I do to be saved and Paul's response to
[34:02] him
[34:04] it's just it could almost be deemed a
[34:06] strange thing that we then latch onto
[34:08] his responses say well I claim that for
[34:10] myself
[34:11] but you see we understand this concept
[34:13] that if God does it one way for one
[34:14] person and if that's then he will do it
[34:17] the same way for other people so so even
[34:19] though Paul was speaking to the Jailer
[34:21] that see that they were in prison
[34:23] singing songs and
[34:26] after they'd been beaten for preaching
[34:28] the gospel and that they were Paul and
[34:29] Silas ended up in prison they were
[34:30] singing they were rejoicing
[34:32] the other jailers would have heard it
[34:34] and they were down in the inner prison
[34:35] and the Jailer was told do not let these
[34:37] guys out you've got to look out you've
[34:39] got to keep them secure down there the
[34:41] Jailer would have heard them singing in
[34:42] that sort of thing but eventually he
[34:44] fell asleep and they were still singing
[34:46] and about midnight the prison shook all
[34:49] the doors were open and the prisoners
[34:50] were free the Jailer woke up and he
[34:53] thought man this is an awful situation
[34:54] to be in
[34:56] these guys I'm supposed to look after
[34:57] are running out the door
[34:59] it's it's either I finished my life now
[35:01] or tomorrow when they find out they're
[35:03] all gone I'll be off with my head so I'd
[35:05] rather just be a bit more graceful and
[35:07] take my life now so he went to take out
[35:09] a sword to kill himself and Paul saw
[35:11] this happen and he said don't kill
[35:13] yourself we're all still here
[35:15] and he knew they were Christians because
[35:17] word gets around you know okay that's
[35:19] these guys they're following this Jesus
[35:21] guy that was in you know in Jerusalem
[35:24] and they they're this funny Bunch
[35:25] they're always jumping up and down and
[35:27] singing carrying on and doing all these
[35:28] funny things and word would have got
[35:30] around who they were they knew why they
[35:31] were there yep they're now they're in
[35:32] this town trying to talk the same thing
[35:34] and these guys the town had enough of
[35:36] them so they put them in the prison
[35:38] so he kind of knew what was going on but
[35:40] but there was enough inside of him there
[35:42] was something inside of him they said
[35:43] that when this happened he said sirs
[35:46] that was his first word sirs what must I
[35:48] do to be saved
[35:50] that's that was his opening question
[35:52] like oh how did this happen it was what
[35:54] must I do to be safe so he knew that
[35:56] what they were preaching was something
[35:57] to do with salvation of his soul
[35:59] something happened now the response that
[36:01] Paul gave him was believe on the Lord
[36:03] Jesus Christ and you and your house
[36:06] shall be saved
[36:08] so and now don't miss the point that
[36:11] Paul is speaking to one person but
[36:13] giving him a promise to other people
[36:14] that we're not there
[36:16] okay now now we can look at that and say
[36:18] okay why did Paul say that he must have
[36:21] because God was going to do what Paul
[36:24] said would happen
[36:25] he's saying if you believe you'll be
[36:27] saved in your house so that's how we can
[36:29] latch onto this and say well
[36:31] Paul wasn't saying that as just a
[36:33] one-off
[36:34] thought he's saying this is the god that
[36:36] I serve and this is what he'll do if
[36:38] you'll go about it this way so we can go
[36:40] about it the same way and achieve the
[36:41] same result okay
[36:44] I want to go through four of these
[36:45] really quick
[36:46] the second one was um Cornelius
[36:49] yeah you like the pictures you little
[36:51] guys and girls good day yeah Uncle Isaac
[36:53] always gets pictures hey
[36:56] now I'm going to warn you about Brother
[36:58] Andy when we telling you last time
[37:01] what did we say he's listening
[37:04] he puts pictures up for you guys and
[37:06] girls that don't even relate to the
[37:07] words just put a picture there hey don't
[37:10] be fooled by that man I've done the hard
[37:11] work I've got pictures that relate to it
[37:13] man you know hello Brother Andy
[37:17] praise the Lord
[37:19] um okay Cornelius now there was a man
[37:22] called Cornelius and the Bible says he
[37:23] was a good man he was a just man
[37:26] a good man and he and he did a lot of uh
[37:29] Good Deeds he was he just had a good
[37:30] heart in him and he prayed to God
[37:33] whichever God that would be to him he
[37:35] felt like it was God he didn't really
[37:38] know who God was but he prayed to this
[37:39] God and it must have been the God
[37:40] because his actions
[37:43] were kind of living out what a Christian
[37:44] would do I'm sorry I just changed that
[37:48] okay at devout man one that feared God
[37:51] so he was fearing the god of the the
[37:53] Jews this this God I believe
[37:55] and then it says in a vision
[37:57] he saw in a vision and an angel came to
[38:00] him and said
[38:02] uh thy prayers and thine arms have come
[38:05] up for a memorial before God this is an
[38:08] important concept uh Cornelius the
[38:11] things you're doing haven't just gone
[38:12] unnoticed your heart and your actions
[38:16] uh they've come up before God and as a
[38:19] result God's going to do something
[38:20] special for you
[38:21] go and get these men go down to drop it
[38:24] get these men and have them to come back
[38:27] so
[38:29] what and sorry I want to go back to this
[38:32] one send men to Joppa and call for Simon
[38:34] whose surname is Peter who shall tell
[38:36] the words whereby thou and all thy house
[38:39] shall be saved
[38:40] so he said it's for you and all your
[38:42] house
[38:43] so then
[38:45] Cornelius acted on the word that he'd
[38:47] been given and he gathered all his
[38:49] family around and he gathered all his
[38:50] friends around too he he took advantage
[38:52] of the situation
[38:53] all his friends because it says and
[38:56] Cornelius waited for them and in court
[38:57] and had called together his Kinsmen and
[39:00] their friends all of his friends too
[39:01] he's like hey if you're coming too you
[39:03] know
[39:05] and then the Bible says that Paul went
[39:07] and spoke the words uh sorry Peter went
[39:10] and ministered to them and as he spoke
[39:12] the Holy Ghost fell upon them and they
[39:13] received the Holy Ghost him and all of
[39:15] his house
[39:16] and all of his friends as well okay
[39:19] so this one was another example he was
[39:21] told something but they said if you want
[39:23] to you can bring in whoever you want to
[39:24] and they can receive the same thing and
[39:27] he acted on it the other one that we go
[39:29] on is the other example so these are
[39:31] examples we can realize okay if God does
[39:33] it this way for them he'll do the same
[39:35] thing for me but this is just a place
[39:36] where our faith is
[39:38] this is the story of Rahab you wanna
[39:40] know the story of Rahab
[39:43] behold when we come into the land Thou
[39:45] shalt bind this line of scarlet threat
[39:47] in the window which thou did US let us
[39:48] down by and thou shalt bring thy father
[39:50] and thy mother and thy Brethren and
[39:53] although father's household home unto
[39:54] thee and it shall be that whosoever
[39:56] shall go out of the doors of thy house
[39:57] into the street his blood shall be upon
[39:59] his head and we will be Guiltless and
[40:01] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[40:03] house his blood shall be on our head if
[40:05] any be upon him
[40:07] so this example here is raheb had this
[40:09] promise
[40:10] now even though the the spies see the
[40:14] spies went into Jericho Rahab realized
[40:16] who they were she had respect to what
[40:18] they were doing and she said the whole
[40:19] city is scared of you they know that
[40:22] that God is with you and we're all
[40:23] scared here even though it looked like a
[40:25] powerful City she confessed we're all
[40:27] scared and the spies went back and told
[40:29] Joshua they're all scared and that gave
[40:31] them faith but but
[40:34] she had something in her that respected
[40:38] these men and she and then the the word
[40:42] got around that these men were in the
[40:43] city and they and the the guards and
[40:45] everyone tried to find them and she hid
[40:46] them in a way and said no they're not
[40:47] here they were here but they took off
[40:49] they ran away and then when all the men
[40:51] went out to find them then she said to
[40:54] the men okay now oh you need to get out
[40:57] once there once they've gone for a
[40:58] couple of days and you I'll let you down
[40:59] the wall and you get out and you'll be
[41:00] safe
[41:01] so she helped these minute Escape but
[41:04] she said I want a short token I want I
[41:06] want to be saved when you come back here
[41:08] I know you're going to wipe the city up
[41:09] and save me now those men
[41:12] gave her a promise on behalf of God
[41:15] because those men didn't hold the walls
[41:16] up
[41:18] they didn't hold up the walls God held
[41:21] up the wall so they had the authority to
[41:23] actually give her a promise that God
[41:24] would back he said you hang the Scarlet
[41:28] thread get everyone in here in here
[41:30] nothing will happen to you and but what
[41:33] if see if it wasn't true they would have
[41:35] just died there and there would have
[41:36] been a Scarlet threat under the rubble
[41:37] on the side of the building
[41:39] but God held that building up because he
[41:41] actually made the promise
[41:44] see when you respect a man or or a
[41:46] minister of the gospel and you receive
[41:48] it as from the Lord then it's the Lord
[41:50] working like the Jailer received that
[41:52] word as from the Lord and claimed it
[41:54] from the Lord so him and his house got
[41:55] saved that's how and when we have
[41:57] respect to the gospel then it works for
[41:59] us the last one I want to show is is the
[42:02] Passover this is another example of a of
[42:04] it of something being applied to a
[42:06] family and whoever is within that can be
[42:09] saved
[42:11] for then I'll just read the scripture
[42:13] for I will pass through the land of
[42:14] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[42:15] first one of the land of Egypt both man
[42:17] and Beast and against all the gods of
[42:19] Egypt will execute judgment I am the
[42:21] Lord
[42:22] and the blood shall be to you for a
[42:24] token upon the house where ye are
[42:27] and when I see the blood I will pass
[42:29] over you and the plague shall not be
[42:30] upon you to destroy you when I smite the
[42:33] land of Egypt
[42:34] okay
[42:37] the concept behind this was if there was
[42:39] this Blood applied onto the door and
[42:41] that's what it looked like that's all I
[42:42] had to do quite a simple thing to save
[42:44] your family wasn't it they just had to
[42:45] paint it on there but they had to
[42:46] believe it
[42:47] if they respected it they said that's it
[42:50] yep they got some hyssop as brother Ed
[42:52] spoke about they got some blood they put
[42:54] it on the door and they sat inside that
[42:56] was all they had to do being saved was
[42:58] very simple just receive it it's not you
[43:00] don't have to
[43:01] do all this Penance and walk up these
[43:03] steps and say all these things and slash
[43:04] your back and all these things you just
[43:06] receive it it's very easy salvation is
[43:08] very easy
[43:10] okay so now I want to look in this with
[43:12] all of these examples you you would say
[43:14] what is your house because we all have
[43:16] different well what what is in my house
[43:18] what can I claim as being my house
[43:19] because I don't believe we can there's
[43:21] no basis to pray a prayer Lord save the
[43:23] whole world
[43:24] because we want to Anchor that on what
[43:27] basis would I anchor that on and I'm
[43:29] just praying the whole world will be
[43:30] safe because I know that it
[43:31] can't happen it doesn't really work like
[43:33] that
[43:34] you know and and even
[43:37] you need to you need to have faith in
[43:39] something you need to know something
[43:41] that's true in order to Anchor your
[43:42] faith onto it if you didn't believe
[43:43] something was true then you wouldn't act
[43:45] on it
[43:45] okay so we need to understand that this
[43:48] is true we can anchor our faith in here
[43:50] then once you've got that you don't have
[43:52] to move for nothing you can stay there
[43:54] okay
[43:55] so the
[43:57] um the
[43:59] the Passover if we if we just take the
[44:01] Passover first as an example who was the
[44:03] Passover
[44:04] uh
[44:05] who sort of who who was over that house
[44:09] you'd say okay it was whoever whoever
[44:11] was in charge of the house it could have
[44:12] been a grandmother could have been a uh
[44:15] Uncle like it wasn't just dead and it
[44:17] was my house because some people maybe
[44:18] the dad was dead and uh and it was the
[44:21] grandmother looking after the house so
[44:22] in this case the grandmother's Faith
[44:23] could say okay this is what I've heard
[44:25] uh children everyone come into my house
[44:27] and put this on and then we're saved I
[44:29] just want to say this because it's not
[44:30] just like the Jailer was the man of the
[44:32] house but it's not just that that's not
[44:33] how this works because that's the
[44:36] Grandma's house that could have been
[44:37] sister's house and all their little
[44:38] siblings because mum and dad are dead
[44:39] but the sister is in charge there it's
[44:41] whoever
[44:42] you understand it can be right uh Rahab
[44:46] that was Rahab in relation to everyone
[44:48] else was either a sister or a daughter
[44:50] but she was able to say come into this
[44:52] house and you'll be saved to the father
[44:55] so so she could say to the grandfather
[44:56] come in and they were saved through her
[44:58] okay uh Cornelius he was the man of the
[45:01] house he was a soldier you know so he
[45:03] was family coming he maybe was quite
[45:05] influential that's where all his friends
[45:06] came to friends coming yeah we're coming
[45:08] too you know that was his influence he
[45:10] had and the Jailer was
[45:13] he was obviously a father because he had
[45:15] it says that his house came in but I put
[45:17] these other examples because you don't
[45:18] just relate it to a man it's your house
[45:21] like sisters everyone has houses this is
[45:24] my house and this is what I can claim
[45:25] for me okay
[45:27] now
[45:29] I'm going to turn this slightly a little
[45:30] bit
[45:31] still going on it but you know I'm going
[45:33] to apply this you know we we have
[45:36] relationships family relationships which
[45:38] are powerful our mothers father
[45:40] in a little powerful relationships but I
[45:43] think I'm going to go more to the
[45:45] children one for a wee bit a parent
[45:47] children one if you don't have children
[45:49] you just have to listen in
[45:51] and when it's your turn you'll remember
[45:52] back to what I said okay because
[45:56] should the Lord Terry okay
[45:58] because that's quite a powerful one
[45:59] because it means something to you you
[46:01] know we we in life we kind of just maybe
[46:02] separate from our natural brothers and
[46:04] sisters and go our own way and that but
[46:06] you know but there's something about our
[46:07] children that are quite close to us you
[46:10] know they they're a bit harder to
[46:11] separate from that because it's like
[46:13] this there's a connection there it's a
[46:14] powerful connection and
[46:17] um the reason why I wanted to speak on
[46:18] this within us too is that here's an
[46:21] interesting concept
[46:22] that six percent of adult Christians
[46:25] that only six percent of adult
[46:26] Christians made their decision to follow
[46:28] the lord after the age of 18. so that
[46:31] means 94 make their choice under the age
[46:34] of 18.
[46:35] so only so very very few
[46:40] people statistically followed the law
[46:42] later on in life they make a decision
[46:44] after 18.
[46:46] if you got saved after 18 you're in the
[46:48] minority
[46:49] you're on the 10 percent
[46:52] and even brother Brown talked about this
[46:54] that you know the the young folk is
[46:56] where the activity is when people get to
[46:59] a certain age they get set they've
[47:01] obviously had their choices they've been
[47:02] in this flexible place and then they get
[47:04] set and then that's the course they
[47:06] generally will take it's a miracle when
[47:09] an atheist of 60 or 70 actually repents
[47:12] and fully comes to the lord it's a very
[47:13] it's a miracle
[47:15] okay but it is possible because
[47:16] anything's possible with God but
[47:19] but in this time of in this youth time
[47:22] here I've just got this one here up
[47:25] there's this transition point where
[47:27] where children where you have people
[47:29] grow up in their their Under head ship
[47:31] and under in their minds you're under
[47:33] head ship too and there's a point where
[47:35] in their mind they start to think
[47:36] actually I'm a person as well I can do
[47:38] things too uh who says you're right that
[47:41] that's human development right we start
[47:43] to grow
[47:44] and it's that's
[47:46] about I don't know 10 11 12 that 12 they
[47:49] start to think these thoughts and it's a
[47:51] transition from being under everything
[47:53] else and then transitioning to actually
[47:55] I want to be my own person you know
[47:56] that's what that's what it's all about I
[47:58] want to be my own man young men I want
[48:00] to be a man you know I'm the man of the
[48:01] house now dad's like no you're not you
[48:04] know I am why can't I be because I pay
[48:06] the bills or you know we it gets a but
[48:08] see when they're small their concept's
[48:10] not there like yes they're no dead you
[48:12] know they're just but it's a transition
[48:14] so then in that transition you have a
[48:16] lot of that's where Satan moves and
[48:18] that's where God moves because they have
[48:20] to then make choices there's a lot of
[48:22] choice being made there it's a very very
[48:23] powerful there's no other time like it
[48:26] for
[48:27] a
[48:28] human being then in this 10 to maybe 17
[48:32] 18 that that time there no other time
[48:34] like it in a in the lifespan of a human
[48:36] being the only reason why I put the
[48:37] other one there is because there's a
[48:39] menopause woman guys that got it easy we
[48:42] just have one little change we're done
[48:44] done and dusted We Carry On
[48:46] women do go through another cycle where
[48:49] it changes their even mindsets it has an
[48:51] effect on on their
[48:53] natural makeup and how they I think
[48:56] their mind thinks and that the same as
[48:58] see the transition here affects people's
[49:00] minds how their minds think they think
[49:01] funny thoughts it's all it's not normal
[49:04] sometimes
[49:05] so these two transitions are unique and
[49:07] Satan knows that that's why he gets in
[49:09] there when he can to mess that up right
[49:11] now the reason why I wanted to speak
[49:13] about this a bit with us is because in
[49:15] our fellowship it just happens and
[49:18] you're looking for yourself hey Divi
[49:21] yeah I love that about human beings that
[49:23] we all love ourselves you know and when
[49:25] we put a picture up where's me
[49:28] whoa where's my son you look for your
[49:31] children hey who look for their children
[49:33] see
[49:34] that's the redeeming love of God is the
[49:36] same where's my son where's my daughter
[49:38] but hey that's how we work and I think
[49:40] it's great like I like a little guy
[49:41] that's me me because I think you know if
[49:43] you were like that you'd probably die
[49:44] you know you need to be calling out I
[49:47] like it I don't think it's selfish I
[49:48] think it's fun
[49:49] but
[49:50] just if I could generalize it seems to
[49:53] be that in our fellowship we have this
[49:55] we've got some some of us have older
[49:57] children that have sort of been through
[49:59] it but and but there's actually I've
[50:03] just noticed the age group of people
[50:04] here there's a sort of big crop you know
[50:06] like they call the Baby Boomers you know
[50:08] that the men came back from the war and
[50:10] then they all settled down and had
[50:11] children and a lot of them and like a
[50:14] short space of time these families
[50:15] exploded across the world and then as a
[50:18] result you had this big age bracket of
[50:20] people moving through Society like now
[50:22] they're all retiring that's why you see
[50:24] uh uh Rest Homes and that that are
[50:26] springing up everywhere it's to
[50:27] accommodate for the Baby Boomers the
[50:29] there's a massive age that are coming
[50:31] through that are working their way
[50:32] through the system so there's there's
[50:34] this age group of people that are more
[50:35] than the other age groups of people that
[50:36] are working its way through
[50:37] statistically that's that's that is the
[50:39] fact so and I just look around us and
[50:42] I've just noticed you know within this
[50:43] little age bracket we're talking about
[50:44] there's like this big crop
[50:46] right in the middle of it working their
[50:47] way through you know like there aren't
[50:49] many below it and there aren't a lot
[50:50] above it there are a few but the crop is
[50:53] sort of all coming through so we're all
[50:55] coming into I mean I've had I've sort of
[50:57] been I've got a few left in there but I
[50:59] kind of me and brother and a few of us
[51:01] have got a few on the other side you
[51:02] know we're we're wiping our scars we're
[51:05] lucky
[51:07] you know we're
[51:09] but we've got a lot this Fellowship has
[51:11] a lot in here
[51:12] a lot a lot and that's why I wanted to
[51:14] talk about this now because this is
[51:15] we're going to be involved in this in a
[51:18] big way
[51:20] some of it's going to be pretty some of
[51:21] us not
[51:22] okay and
[51:24] that's going to be the way that it is
[51:25] but we're we're but that's why we're
[51:27] speaking about this because we want to
[51:28] get it out in the open because Satan
[51:30] always tries to mess around and when
[51:32] there's big Transitions and things he
[51:33] always tries to mess with us
[51:35] and you see when we're going along a
[51:37] straight everything's quite easy but
[51:39] when it's when you have to turn a corner
[51:40] that's when things get funny that's when
[51:43] accidents happen that's when things are
[51:45] different difficult okay
[51:48] we took the children go-karting the
[51:50] other day
[51:51] it was actually for Richie's birthday
[51:53] and and I recorded some video and
[51:56] this video shows people going along a
[51:59] straight all like everything's all nice
[52:00] and these youth are going along
[52:02] everything's all nice and then they hit
[52:03] this age of about
[52:04] this
[52:06] they try to take the turn you know Jay
[52:08] tries to go and all Ricky's going a
[52:10] little bit fast
[52:11] boom Nails them but Tamers held back a
[52:13] bit though there's trouble here
[52:15] timer decides the coast is clear but no
[52:18] there's another crop coming on and it's
[52:19] AV oh it's that all comes in
[52:22] again
[52:26] meanwhile Hannah see your children are
[52:28] different story of your life once
[52:30] everyone's made their kindness just
[52:31] leisurely goes around you know as if
[52:35] nothing was going on
[52:39] and
[52:40] I think you'll find
[52:42] that we are
[52:46] I don't know what the Lord's going to do
[52:49] I don't know what the law is going to do
[52:50] but it may there may be some of those
[52:52] situations some will just easily go
[52:54] around other ones there'll be a bit of
[52:55] Crash and Carnage that's it may be all
[52:58] 100 no crashes it may be a couple of
[53:00] crashes maybe all crashes
[53:02] you know and we don't want any crashes
[53:04] but that's just you've got to be honest
[53:07] there's a sharp corner there's a big
[53:08] transition there's going to be there's
[53:09] going to be something happen okay
[53:11] there's going to be something happening
[53:12] somewhere okay now before I get into
[53:15] this I want to take a big picture
[53:17] perspective
[53:20] you know when we speak about raising
[53:22] children of things we can we can go down
[53:23] to small things and say well if you do
[53:25] this this will affect their psychology
[53:26] and then later on they'll think this and
[53:28] that and that that's good to do that
[53:30] because you know you're zoning in but
[53:32] when you take a big picture perspective
[53:33] you think okay what's the what's the
[53:35] what's the most important outcome for my
[53:37] children that I want you know do I want
[53:39] to have this little attitude or that or
[53:40] overall if I could only choose one thing
[53:42] what would I choose
[53:44] you choose their salvation right that's
[53:46] okay that yeah I don't care if it's a
[53:48] horrible child just save them you know
[53:50] rather he'd be horrible and safe to
[53:52] obviously if they say they won't be but
[53:53] I'm saying when you pull it right back
[53:55] right
[53:56] that's what you would want and the only
[53:58] way that that can happen is if the Lord
[54:00] does it is the only way no amount of all
[54:03] your effort all your work all your
[54:04] trying your this and that now that can
[54:06] Aid it I understand that but I'm saying
[54:08] from a big picture perspective the only
[54:10] thing that can save your child is the
[54:12] Lord nothing else if you think that you
[54:15] can do it you've got if you you'll see
[54:18] as you go along down the road that it's
[54:19] not quite that simple that there's a
[54:21] thing in everyone's mind that only God
[54:22] can work there's somewhere in them that
[54:24] you can't touch just it doesn't matter
[54:26] if they're close to you or not close to
[54:27] you you there's a place that only God
[54:29] can touch right
[54:30] and you you have to accept this concept
[54:33] in order to be able to apply faith
[54:35] okay because when you understand this do
[54:37] you think Lord okay I'll do everything I
[54:38] can I want to yeah I understand these
[54:40] things I do yes I understand that
[54:42] but there have been people saved that
[54:44] the parents did nothing
[54:45] hated them
[54:46] cast them out and that person got saved
[54:49] you think it was the dad's great
[54:51] parenting the dad wasn't there the mum
[54:52] wasn't there you see
[54:55] okay so I want to get that young that
[54:57] were you happy with that concept yep
[54:58] okay so
[55:01] now
[55:02] we get this funny hand dealt to us in
[55:05] life that some children are one way and
[55:08] some are the other
[55:10] right like some people just are born
[55:12] like this they're just angry
[55:14] other girls are just like they're just
[55:16] real nice they just or is it the other
[55:18] way around guys the girls are
[55:20] grumpy and the guys are like hey they
[55:22] just you know
[55:23] but you get dealt a different
[55:26] they just come out different you think
[55:28] well I've got this whole parenting thing
[55:29] all down you know
[55:31] and then the next one comes along and
[55:32] it's different you're like well hang on
[55:33] hang on no no this doesn't I've got that
[55:35] one sorted out this one I apply the same
[55:37] tactic to this one and it doesn't quite
[55:39] work the same
[55:40] it's a complex situation okay very very
[55:43] very complex oh here we go is this is
[55:46] this is this more what it is hey that's
[55:48] what it is alien yes Liam there and
[55:52] who's that
[55:53] we won't don't answer that
[55:58] man that was close brother
[56:01] very close to you could have could have
[56:03] been a rift in the youth group in the
[56:05] Sunday School you bet it would have had
[56:07] the same school teachers would have had
[56:08] some work they're just different people
[56:11] are just all different that's how we
[56:13] we we just
[56:17] and they can be different in the same
[56:18] household one thinks one way and is like
[56:20] this one another way and you think it's
[56:22] the same household like like this one
[56:24] the The Prodigal Son versus his brother
[56:26] I'm gonna venture to say they say
[56:28] essentially were born in the same house
[56:29] raised under the same ideas and and
[56:32] belief systems and everything and the
[56:34] same amount of let's go ahead that he
[56:36] had that I I think it was hey within the
[56:38] whole sibling thing he got more than me
[56:41] no they got more than Me overall you'd
[56:44] say they were reasonably the same
[56:47] right like it's not not different like
[56:49] one was adopted in when he was older and
[56:52] so he was from a whole different
[56:53] background it was the same and yet one
[56:55] decides I'm out of here one decides I'm
[56:57] staying
[56:58] so then you look at that and you think
[57:00] so
[57:03] in this situation here
[57:05] see because parents can sometimes get a
[57:06] bit down but this what did the dad do
[57:09] wrong in this situation
[57:10] and the other one came out all right so
[57:12] but this one's disappearing
[57:14] when you look at it like maybe if they
[57:17] both would have gone you may have said
[57:18] oh maybe the dad did something wrong
[57:19] because that's how we like to think but
[57:21] then you've got a 50 50 split
[57:24] something it just it just was now we
[57:27] have to some that sometimes that just is
[57:29] now we go into parenting right
[57:35] I haven't got
[57:38] where I've got the fix on
[57:41] I don't okay we go into parenting
[57:46] you know and we think we've got it all
[57:48] together hey
[57:49] here we go
[57:51] this is just this picture
[57:53] no no that's not the one sorry
[57:56] we're going to Parenting and we think oh
[57:58] man my parents were nice but they
[58:00] weren't there no we're near as good as
[58:01] what I'm going to do and you know I'm
[58:02] going to do it so much better than them
[58:03] because they did this and this and this
[58:05] and then we go and do it and we get down
[58:07] the road a while and we're like oh okay
[58:08] it's not quite as easy as what I thought
[58:10] and then we get further down the road
[58:12] and we're like man and then in the
[58:13] meantime our children are saying I mean
[58:15] when I ever have children man I'm not
[58:16] going to be doing it like them
[58:18] and and our parents know that we've said
[58:20] the same thing about them
[58:22] and so on goes the cycle of life that
[58:24] none of us really know what we're doing
[58:26] when we when we accept the reality of it
[58:28] and we say Lord It's Only by your grace
[58:30] and mercy that I'm going to ever amount
[58:31] to anything can you just help me Lord
[58:33] and you know you think you're doing the
[58:35] right thing and then maybe 10 years
[58:36] later you realize man I've just messed
[58:38] up for 10 years I should have been doing
[58:39] it this way and you're like but I've
[58:40] come 10 years down the track I've got to
[58:41] try and write this wrong and then you
[58:44] try and do that and it's just all and
[58:46] maybe you do something right and then
[58:47] the next one you do it wrong it's all
[58:48] just it's complicated
[58:50] it's never as easy when we do it
[58:53] but I want to
[58:55] I want to say this to to keep our minds
[58:59] our attitude corrects that if you have a
[59:01] prodigal son or daughter that goes a
[59:03] certain way it's very important don't
[59:05] beat yourself up self up over it because
[59:07] that's the first thing Satan's going to
[59:09] try and make you sure you can look back
[59:11] and think you know we always like to
[59:12] contemplate there's nothing wrong with
[59:14] that but we can get really beaten up by
[59:17] this now I know what I'm talking about
[59:18] because I've been through it
[59:19] right
[59:21] and we can start to really beat
[59:22] ourselves up over it and and it's all us
[59:24] and you imagine someone that just had
[59:26] one and then they went out like that you
[59:27] know and they've got no other reference
[59:29] like maybe the the
[59:31] the father was with the prodigal son at
[59:33] least he thought wow I can't be all bad
[59:35] this guy's still here and he's all right
[59:36] you know there's a there's a bit of a
[59:38] balance for his mind but
[59:40] it's important that
[59:43] that you don't beat yourself up over
[59:44] because that's what Satan wants you to
[59:47] do right
[59:48] but then if you've got a couple of
[59:50] stayers some people just like
[59:53] Say the video that I showed you of the
[59:54] cars you know these guys are Crash and
[59:56] Burn and that and then one of the girls
[59:57] just
[59:58] happily goes around makes the transition
[1:00:00] carries on down the track some people
[1:00:02] are just like that
[1:00:04] now God's got all sorts of different
[1:00:05] stories he wants to tell
[1:00:07] okay and we need to start to accept this
[1:00:09] as being like that and we're we're not
[1:00:10] the be-all and end all and in control of
[1:00:12] everything
[1:00:13] okay we need to we need to understand
[1:00:15] that way like
[1:00:17] and I want to I want to touch on this
[1:00:19] topic because
[1:00:21] we like to
[1:00:22] we have this
[1:00:25] like testimonies
[1:00:28] like like we like to hear interesting
[1:00:29] testimonies uh brother John shared
[1:00:31] testimonies on on the weekend right and
[1:00:33] what testimonies did he share of he
[1:00:35] shared uh this person this girl was
[1:00:37] going through this hard thing and she
[1:00:38] was cutting her wrists you know and now
[1:00:41] we hear that and that sounds drastic
[1:00:42] because we're like wow she's got a knife
[1:00:44] out you're imagining in your mind she's
[1:00:46] got a knife out and she's slashing her
[1:00:47] wrists and so it's an intense it's a
[1:00:49] powerful story so it's worth retelling
[1:00:52] because we like to hear powerful stories
[1:00:54] and then
[1:00:55] how then now God came through
[1:00:59] but you didn't hear a story about
[1:01:00] another sister in the church that you
[1:01:02] just never heard nothing of she's been
[1:01:03] there since she was a little girl now
[1:01:04] she's playing the piano and praising the
[1:01:06] Lord and never cause no one any trouble
[1:01:09] and she's like well what about me I've
[1:01:11] been right well if I buy battle so I
[1:01:13] just wasn't slashing myself but you know
[1:01:15] but they
[1:01:17] like if we applied the same logic to
[1:01:19] like a race say a a bike race right
[1:01:22] one person I think I could say this one
[1:01:24] person is in a bike race and they they
[1:01:27] do really well you only ever talk about
[1:01:29] people that do well in races eh like
[1:01:31] well you see that person that ran that
[1:01:32] did that bike race at the start they
[1:01:34] took off and then they rode really fast
[1:01:35] they took that corner really well and
[1:01:37] then that's straight and they were so
[1:01:38] fit and then they went up that hurling
[1:01:41] down and they how they took those
[1:01:42] Corners there and then they came in and
[1:01:43] they won the race they're awesome you'd
[1:01:45] clap clap clap
[1:01:46] but then this other guy man he started
[1:01:49] off didn't get five meters before he's
[1:01:50] off the bank and then he he's out there
[1:01:52] and he goes and he takes the wrong way
[1:01:54] the guys are trying to tell him it's
[1:01:55] this way and he goes the wrong way ends
[1:01:57] up in a river and then he's lost his
[1:01:58] bike and he's got to walk the rest of it
[1:02:00] and his shoes fall apart and he he
[1:02:02] finally gets to the end and we laugh at
[1:02:04] him good on you for trying
[1:02:06] you know now and a testimonial sense we
[1:02:09] would testify that guy's this guy here
[1:02:11] oh man it took a while but he made it
[1:02:13] you know I don't want to be little with
[1:02:15] the story because because the thing
[1:02:17] about it is God's got stories he's also
[1:02:19] a storyteller
[1:02:20] and that's why I say this sometimes God
[1:02:23] just wants to tell a story
[1:02:25] and and
[1:02:26] you hear the testimonies but you can't
[1:02:29] have a testimony without a test
[1:02:31] and some people just got to go through a
[1:02:33] test
[1:02:35] like that that girl if she didn't cut
[1:02:36] her wrists you wouldn't have heard the
[1:02:37] testimony
[1:02:38] you understand it and that's why I say
[1:02:41] don't beat yourself up don't think oh if
[1:02:43] you have committed everything to the
[1:02:44] Lord
[1:02:45] sometimes God's writing a testimony
[1:02:47] this is an important concept because it
[1:02:49] seems like we're throwing out all of our
[1:02:51] parental duties
[1:02:53] but when you understand God's a bit
[1:02:55] bigger than all this sometimes he wants
[1:02:57] a testimony like we'll tell a story
[1:02:58] about this guy that went out and wanted
[1:02:59] to be a gang member and he did this and
[1:03:01] that but then God called him home God's
[1:03:03] got those stories
[1:03:05] he says this is going to be your journey
[1:03:06] because I want to do this story that's
[1:03:07] why he says here
[1:03:09] how thank you if a man have a hundred
[1:03:11] sheep when one of them be gone astray
[1:03:13] the Earth he not leave the 99 and Goth
[1:03:14] into the mountains and seek us that
[1:03:16] which has gone astray sometimes he's got
[1:03:18] the story
[1:03:18] wait here sheep I'm gonna go find that
[1:03:20] one you know and the sheath rule back
[1:03:22] there wow is he going to find him that's
[1:03:23] the story
[1:03:24] and then he and they they might see the
[1:03:26] Sheep way up on the side of the cliff is
[1:03:29] he going to get him
[1:03:30] I think he will and the Shepherds
[1:03:33] scaling the side of the mountain pass
[1:03:34] and he's and the rocks are slipping down
[1:03:36] the side of the mountain and he's
[1:03:37] hanging on to the the roots of the trees
[1:03:40] and he
[1:03:41] and he has his he can't quite get to it
[1:03:43] so he gets off his he's got maybe a
[1:03:45] scarf around him and he ties it onto the
[1:03:48] the tree branch and he lulls himself
[1:03:50] down and he rescues the sheep and all
[1:03:52] the Sheep are watching it going wow what
[1:03:54] an amazing Shepherd we have
[1:03:56] I mean
[1:03:58] something's trying to mess with me the
[1:04:00] screen
[1:04:01] um I don't say anything
[1:04:03] um
[1:04:04] so you see God's got stories so we we
[1:04:09] you have to accept sometimes if you're a
[1:04:11] believer in your plan then there's going
[1:04:12] to be some people will take a path
[1:04:14] okay now I'm not going I'm not saying
[1:04:17] you understand what I mean
[1:04:20] okay yeah good good because it's it's um
[1:04:24] otherwise we can think wrong in our mind
[1:04:26] when we see someone going somewhere and
[1:04:28] we can start to think oh maybe that
[1:04:29] parent did this maybe they did that
[1:04:31] maybe they didn't
[1:04:32] what did job do last time I checked he
[1:04:35] didn't do much wrong
[1:04:36] you understand
[1:04:38] there has to be a test if there's a
[1:04:40] testimony if you want to have a story of
[1:04:42] redemption somewhere then someone's got
[1:04:43] to go to a dark place to be redeemed
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:46] now sometimes it's the grace of God that
[1:04:48] allows that because then there's a story
[1:04:50] there's there's hope for other people
[1:04:52] you know you can say look there's hope
[1:04:53] for you I've been through that you know
[1:04:55] and if I could speak just from my heart
[1:04:57] for a few minutes then I've got some
[1:04:59] I just want to speak to you about my
[1:05:01] journey because I've been the Lord's
[1:05:02] been gracious enough to me that I've
[1:05:04] been able to go through
[1:05:06] take a few of these different pathways
[1:05:07] on this journey I've had
[1:05:11] I've had one I've
[1:05:13] I'm just going to speak openly from my
[1:05:15] heart you know I've had I've had
[1:05:17] happiness and I've had sadness on this
[1:05:20] journey I've been a path of happiness
[1:05:22] and I've been on a path of a lot of
[1:05:23] sadness
[1:05:24] and and I thank God for the journey I
[1:05:27] think Lord sometimes I sit back I think
[1:05:28] Lord you've brought me so through me
[1:05:30] through so many hard things in my life
[1:05:32] like just sometimes it's not bearable
[1:05:34] Shannon said my hair's growing back now
[1:05:36] but
[1:05:38] but this stuff makes you lose your hair
[1:05:40] you just you're under so much pressure
[1:05:42] for years that just your body is is
[1:05:44] getting worn down under this pressure
[1:05:46] but I'm glad the Lord let me go through
[1:05:48] it because I can understand it and I
[1:05:50] have had to take this journey and I I've
[1:05:53] looked around on the journey because you
[1:05:54] know God's gracious and you can look
[1:05:55] around and realize wow this is this is
[1:05:57] what this path looks like
[1:05:59] and
[1:06:00] I just want to tell you a few stories
[1:06:02] and Dave won't mind me saying this
[1:06:03] because you know why go through a path
[1:06:06] and you can't actually tell some of your
[1:06:07] experiences on the way that other people
[1:06:09] that are going through something maybe
[1:06:10] you can say hey look I know what you're
[1:06:11] going through it's all right it's going
[1:06:13] to be all right
[1:06:15] but this is just some you know you know
[1:06:17] me I do a lot of song leading not not
[1:06:19] because I really want to but I always
[1:06:20] get told I have to songly so a song Lead
[1:06:22] and that's the truth God knows that's
[1:06:24] the truth it's only been the last 12
[1:06:26] months I've actually enjoyed it for the
[1:06:27] first time in my life I've actually
[1:06:28] thought I enjoy that but the rest of the
[1:06:31] so who remembers this camp this was uh
[1:06:34] brother Diggs
[1:06:36] you remember this time
[1:06:38] that that service everyone in the whole
[1:06:40] church is up on their feet praising the
[1:06:41] Lord You're all about most of the people
[1:06:43] there some that weren't this was what
[1:06:45] was happening the Lord was moving
[1:06:46] everyone was up praising the Lord
[1:06:47] singing and on their feet now there was
[1:06:49] one person
[1:06:51] there was one person in the whole of the
[1:06:55] congregation that was sitting down not
[1:06:57] into it one person
[1:06:59] who do you think that was
[1:07:04] David
[1:07:06] right if you don't mind me saying this
[1:07:07] okay I need I'm going to talk about this
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:10] I remember
[1:07:12] sitting at the back because we we had
[1:07:13] our seat near the back looking around at
[1:07:15] everyone praising the Lord and look and
[1:07:17] looking and seeing there's one person in
[1:07:19] this whole building of 300 people that's
[1:07:20] just not into it at all stubborn not
[1:07:23] gonna move not gonna do nothing sitting
[1:07:25] down
[1:07:25] and I thought that's my son of everyone
[1:07:27] here
[1:07:28] and you think about
[1:07:30] I'm not the only one that can see that
[1:07:33] right you guys are all conceived with
[1:07:34] your eyes you can look around and you
[1:07:36] probably glanced over and other people
[1:07:38] did too oh
[1:07:40] there's David
[1:07:42] not standing up
[1:07:44] right now
[1:07:47] you think about I've got to get up there
[1:07:50] walk up I've got to see that and I know
[1:07:52] what's I know he doesn't want to be
[1:07:54] there he's not into God I'm just I'm
[1:07:55] done with all this nonsense I'm not into
[1:07:57] it I've got to see that
[1:07:59] then I've got to walk up here
[1:08:01] and I've got to walk up here and say
[1:08:03] praise the Lord we're going to have a
[1:08:04] good time in the Lord this morning who's
[1:08:05] ready to praise the Lord
[1:08:07] do you know that was hard to do
[1:08:10] you don't know that that was hard to do
[1:08:12] I was sitting down there thinking Lord I
[1:08:14] don't want to get up there I just don't
[1:08:15] want to get up there
[1:08:16] no man
[1:08:18] it was hard
[1:08:19] and you know I had to go up there you
[1:08:21] put on a brave face praise the Lord now
[1:08:25] that at some point it becomes a real
[1:08:27] face like no this is what I believe I'm
[1:08:29] going to praise the Lord you know but
[1:08:30] there's a point of challenge where you
[1:08:32] think this is hard this is It's not like
[1:08:34] oh I I don't see what's happening I saw
[1:08:37] what was happening and it was hard
[1:08:39] then the next Camp the next Camp was
[1:08:41] even slightly harder because I think
[1:08:42] there was there were a few messages that
[1:08:45] talked about it basically if your
[1:08:46] children are like that then it's the
[1:08:48] parents fault and this one David wasn't
[1:08:51] even there
[1:08:53] I remember on the Sunday afternoon I
[1:08:55] left the camp and I drove down to otaki
[1:08:57] Beach
[1:08:58] and I parked at the beach and I said
[1:08:59] Lord I just I just don't want to go back
[1:09:01] to that camp you realize how hard this
[1:09:02] is for me like
[1:09:03] everyone knows Dave's not there you know
[1:09:05] and and here I am and I'm supposed to
[1:09:07] get up and lead people and worship like
[1:09:10] yeah you know the the this affects our
[1:09:13] mind right this doesn't just we don't
[1:09:16] just leisurely stroll through this and
[1:09:17] it's all easy it's hard for about it was
[1:09:19] hard for my mind Lord
[1:09:23] this is hard for me now these are just a
[1:09:25] few examples that you would know because
[1:09:27] you were at these camps and you you
[1:09:28] would have seen me go up there and say
[1:09:30] we're going to praise the Lord now
[1:09:31] but it wasn't easy it wasn't like there
[1:09:34] was a sacrifice for praise
[1:09:35] okay but
[1:09:37] so if you're going through this I know
[1:09:39] what you're going through I understand
[1:09:40] that's why I'm very gracious of people
[1:09:42] are going through it I'm like no no it's
[1:09:43] all going to be all right you you're not
[1:09:45] going to hear you're not if my thoughts
[1:09:47] could speak they they're not going to
[1:09:48] speak anything negative about you or
[1:09:49] your situation at all because I've been
[1:09:51] there I know what it's like and there's
[1:09:52] a lot of twisting and turning in your
[1:09:54] mind was it because I did this did I do
[1:09:56] that did I do that and Satan's always
[1:09:58] trying to play at you like that oh you
[1:09:59] did this it's because you did that it's
[1:10:00] because of this it's because of that
[1:10:01] he's messing with you for a lot he's
[1:10:03] saying it's all it's all you
[1:10:04] we have to say no we have to pull back
[1:10:07] and say no I'm applying the token it's
[1:10:08] all going to be all right I don't care
[1:10:09] what I did you know and
[1:10:12] you know I used to in in my in my times
[1:10:16] of thinking I would I
[1:10:18] I would think a lot and I would think I
[1:10:20] said to Shannon we know the sister that
[1:10:22] we actually baptized here in Gisborne
[1:10:24] and her mother believes the Lord her
[1:10:26] father not interested in God
[1:10:28] says it's all a load of nonsense not
[1:10:31] true
[1:10:33] and I said to Shannon and so this this
[1:10:35] girl has come out serving the lord loves
[1:10:37] the Lord baptized at a young age younger
[1:10:40] than Dave I said to Shannon that's what
[1:10:42] I did wrong I should have said to Dave I
[1:10:44] should have just disbelieved God look he
[1:10:46] had he disbelieved God he just he told
[1:10:49] her this other father told his daughter
[1:10:52] her whole life don't believe God don't
[1:10:54] go to church it's all a load of
[1:10:55] nonsenses don't do it and he wasn't
[1:10:58] saying that to use reverse psychology he
[1:11:00] doesn't believe in God and he was
[1:11:01] telling her it's nonsense I don't know
[1:11:02] where you're going every Sunday when she
[1:11:03] go to church I don't know where you're
[1:11:04] going there it's a waste of time still
[1:11:06] is the same to this day
[1:11:08] right
[1:11:09] and I thought well and and look at his
[1:11:11] result
[1:11:13] how does this work here's me I've been
[1:11:15] doing this for 20 years man week after
[1:11:17] week after week and this is what I get
[1:11:18] no I wasn't saying that but the devil's
[1:11:21] saying and you'll be doing that all that
[1:11:22] time and that's what you get
[1:11:24] what of it it messes with our mind you
[1:11:27] know we we battle but we think no it's
[1:11:30] all going to be all right the the Lord's
[1:11:32] he's and actually that idea was powerful
[1:11:35] for me the Lord said I'm just writing a
[1:11:36] testimony you've got to go through a
[1:11:38] test to get a testimony I couldn't tell
[1:11:40] you the story if I didn't go through it
[1:11:42] sometimes it's just writing a testimony
[1:11:44] was I did I do everything all wrong
[1:11:47] this one here I don't really care too
[1:11:48] much for Christmas trees and all that
[1:11:50] but this but you know one of my desires
[1:11:53] of my heart was I came from a sort of
[1:11:54] semi-broken family where it all kind of
[1:11:57] people went away from serving the lord
[1:12:00] and then we would have these big
[1:12:01] Christmas parties and they were never
[1:12:02] nice because there was always
[1:12:03] different partners from my family each
[1:12:06] year and it would be different children
[1:12:08] would sort of they would
[1:12:10] be with someone and then they would have
[1:12:12] two children they would have two in this
[1:12:14] so each year you'd see different people
[1:12:15] would turn up because it was all broken
[1:12:17] families and things and then it would
[1:12:19] just be a whole lot of drinking and not
[1:12:21] not a nice environment and I thought
[1:12:23] Lord I never want this from my family
[1:12:25] like when I'm when I'm here and I and
[1:12:28] I've got this family sort of when I'm
[1:12:30] the patriarch and got this below me I
[1:12:31] just don't want that I just want
[1:12:33] Believers I want my children to marry
[1:12:35] Believers we can come together on
[1:12:37] Christmas we can all gather and and they
[1:12:39] can be an atmosphere that we're all just
[1:12:42] love the Lord and then we're gonna I'm
[1:12:43] just Lord It's we don't even need to
[1:12:45] talk about the Lord but we will but you
[1:12:47] know it's just the atmosphere I just
[1:12:48] want that and we all we all know hey we
[1:12:50] just we love the Lord that's that was a
[1:12:52] desire of my heart and so
[1:12:54] when I started going the other way Satan
[1:12:55] was always messing with me oh he Dave's
[1:12:58] probably going to go and get someone
[1:12:59] pregnant and then then that'll be your
[1:13:01] whole idea of a of you have that nice
[1:13:04] Christmas thing is going to be all
[1:13:05] messed up because you can have and he
[1:13:06] may not be with her then you're gonna
[1:13:07] have this other little kid some you're
[1:13:09] going to be a grandfather of some kid
[1:13:11] you don't really get to know much and
[1:13:12] just all this stuff you know
[1:13:14] he was saying that's the way it's going
[1:13:15] to happen you know it's not going to
[1:13:16] you're not going to get what you want
[1:13:18] but you know God will give us the
[1:13:20] desires of our heart if we say Lord I'm
[1:13:22] going to serve you and I'm going to
[1:13:24] Delight myself and you and you'll give
[1:13:25] me the desires of your heart
[1:13:26] of my heart
[1:13:28] one more
[1:13:30] this was another this is uh this this
[1:13:33] little concept here is a part of the
[1:13:34] journey too though
[1:13:35] because I've seen people
[1:13:39] one day when I was lying in bed and it
[1:13:42] was
[1:13:42] the whole fight between David and I was
[1:13:45] the fact that he didn't want to serve
[1:13:47] God and I did that that was the
[1:13:51] old that when you boil it down that was
[1:13:52] the issue one didn't want to one did
[1:13:55] so then that at a certain point down the
[1:13:58] road I because I didn't like the
[1:13:59] fractionist I thought this is not the
[1:14:01] way I I didn't stay out of family to be
[1:14:02] fractured like this and for this to be a
[1:14:04] war I didn't start it for that purpose
[1:14:07] and I don't want to be in this war
[1:14:09] I I wanted it to be together and we're
[1:14:11] just happy I'm just a nice I like things
[1:14:13] to be together and happy
[1:14:15] so
[1:14:17] there was a point where I was laying
[1:14:19] down on my bed and and then it I saw it
[1:14:22] that not that that's the problem but the
[1:14:25] issue is one wants to serve God and one
[1:14:27] doesn't so then the option came well you
[1:14:29] realize if you just compromise and just
[1:14:31] don't worry about so much stuff and just
[1:14:32] let the bars down a bit and do that then
[1:14:34] you could you guys could get on in other
[1:14:36] words go down to
[1:14:38] go to the other camper but more and then
[1:14:40] then you guys can have Unity again
[1:14:43] and that's the option that some people
[1:14:44] take they realize oh if it's going to
[1:14:46] cause a friction a husband and wife uh
[1:14:48] uh okay or I'll stop going to church as
[1:14:49] much then and I'll just I'll go there
[1:14:51] you see it's called compromise and
[1:14:54] sometimes that's the path that people
[1:14:56] take but I can assure you it never gets
[1:14:58] anywhere
[1:14:59] and but the Lord knows our hearts so in
[1:15:02] this situation here when I when I read
[1:15:04] through this verse
[1:15:05] I read through I read through for I am
[1:15:08] think not that I am come to send peace
[1:15:10] on Earth I'm not come to send peace but
[1:15:12] a sword
[1:15:13] for I am come to sit a man at variance
[1:15:15] against his father and the daughter
[1:15:16] against her mother
[1:15:18] and the daughter-in-law against her
[1:15:19] mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be
[1:15:21] they of his own household and it dawned
[1:15:24] on me okay Lord if I'm going to serve
[1:15:26] you and if it cost me this then it cost
[1:15:27] me this
[1:15:29] now that sounds like a harsh decision
[1:15:31] but that's the decision I made Lord oh
[1:15:32] well yes I can see it's because I want
[1:15:35] to serve you he doesn't there's going to
[1:15:37] be a sword okay then there'll be a sword
[1:15:40] that sounds harsh but that's the choice
[1:15:42] I made okay Lord if that's what it's
[1:15:43] going to be I read this and then you
[1:15:45] warn me you might come into a situation
[1:15:47] where this is going to happen
[1:15:49] what are you going to choose
[1:15:51] and
[1:15:52] he that loveth father or mother more
[1:15:54] than me is not worthy of me he that
[1:15:55] lover son or daughter more than me is
[1:15:57] not worthy of me
[1:15:59] when it dawned on me that this was
[1:16:00] happening and that I had the choice to
[1:16:02] make in here I said Lord that's it then
[1:16:03] there's a sword and I was happy
[1:16:05] well then there'll be a sword
[1:16:09] you understand I was content I could
[1:16:10] live with the sword for the rest of my
[1:16:11] life Lord that's what you said it would
[1:16:13] be no I didn't want a sword but I was I
[1:16:15] accepted it does that sound harsh
[1:16:18] that's because that's what you should do
[1:16:20] if you come in the same situation
[1:16:23] you may come on this point in the road
[1:16:24] I'm just saying on this junior you may
[1:16:26] come here
[1:16:27] thankfully
[1:16:28] the Lord took away the sword because
[1:16:31] he's true to his word
[1:16:32] okay and we and and I you know we stand
[1:16:35] our ground for the Lord and the Lord
[1:16:36] fights our battles and he he makes
[1:16:38] things his way
[1:16:40] now I'm gonna just go through a few of
[1:16:42] these then I'm going to be done
[1:16:44] okay but I want to touch on this right
[1:16:46] because this is another
[1:16:48] we can't just pretend nothing happens
[1:16:50] and it's not hard
[1:16:52] you heard the saying One Bad Apple
[1:16:53] spoils a bunch
[1:16:54] you know that one bad thing amongst the
[1:16:57] group it just look at this apple it's
[1:16:58] rotten and it started to spread through
[1:16:59] all the rest
[1:17:01] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna come out and
[1:17:04] say that if someone in the church starts
[1:17:05] to go if a young person starts to go a
[1:17:07] certain way
[1:17:08] it does cause trouble
[1:17:10] that's the reality of it right we can't
[1:17:12] pretend oh no no it does start to do
[1:17:15] this right now
[1:17:18] that's an issue now it's not an issue
[1:17:20] that we want to deal with but sometimes
[1:17:22] we get forced with this issue well uh
[1:17:24] brother so-and-so's kid is um you're not
[1:17:27] doing so well
[1:17:29] and uh you hear what he said to the
[1:17:32] other girl there the other day at church
[1:17:33] or you know when they start to now
[1:17:35] that's reality
[1:17:37] so
[1:17:38] and it's a hard situation because
[1:17:42] they these things do happen in a
[1:17:44] fellowship and and I want to put it like
[1:17:46] this I'll just show I'll put it here
[1:17:51] I need to explain those situations just
[1:17:53] so everybody knows that it's a bad
[1:17:55] situation
[1:17:57] okay and there's no perfect option
[1:17:58] nothing you choose the best of a bunch
[1:18:01] of bad options or the lesser of two
[1:18:03] evils do I let my children go with them
[1:18:05] do I not
[1:18:08] none of the situation one's not right
[1:18:10] one's not right they're both they're
[1:18:12] both not good don't go into it thinking
[1:18:15] oh what's the perfect thing to do there
[1:18:16] is no perfect thing you're a negative
[1:18:18] territory
[1:18:19] it's very important you understand this
[1:18:21] if you have to go through this leave
[1:18:23] everything there when you get out of it
[1:18:24] because there's no right in this
[1:18:27] situation
[1:18:28] this is very important to understand
[1:18:30] this like oh well
[1:18:32] you know when I was Baxley and silento
[1:18:35] didn't let their children with me
[1:18:37] so
[1:18:38] maybe they knew that their children at
[1:18:39] that point were a certain way they're
[1:18:40] like I just I just can't take the risk
[1:18:44] other families like now my child's fine
[1:18:45] yeah go on go on to them
[1:18:48] but you need to understand there is a
[1:18:50] this is happening
[1:18:52] okay so you can't deny that's happening
[1:18:54] and we've all got to be understanding in
[1:18:56] this situation some parents are happy
[1:18:58] with this other ones are not they're not
[1:19:00] right or they're not wrong
[1:19:02] you know
[1:19:04] that's important that we talk about this
[1:19:05] because it's
[1:19:06] it's like
[1:19:09] and you can't look back and think wow
[1:19:10] and analyze the situation later on
[1:19:12] Everyone likes to do that you know like
[1:19:13] uh something goes wrong in a game and
[1:19:16] they've got it happened in a split
[1:19:18] second moment and yet people have got
[1:19:19] weeks to talk about that moment that
[1:19:21] people have to make Split Second
[1:19:22] decisions
[1:19:23] Okay so
[1:19:26] and you've even heard some preachers say
[1:19:28] oh they they should have let their
[1:19:29] children go with them well no I think
[1:19:32] even the parents need to be honest like
[1:19:33] I liked Shannon Shannon's stance was she
[1:19:35] told the people no no actually don't
[1:19:37] bring your kids around my place at the
[1:19:38] moment sorry but he said no Dave's not
[1:19:41] doing so well and I just it's not a very
[1:19:42] nice atmosphere I'd rather you just
[1:19:44] didn't
[1:19:45] you know did you know that
[1:19:47] okay
[1:19:49] but thanks for going through that Dave
[1:19:51] because this is this is you know
[1:19:54] this is we can talk about it and we can
[1:19:56] say Hey you may end up in that situation
[1:19:57] and you as a parent need to say hey look
[1:20:00] guys you know
[1:20:01] yeah the reality is
[1:20:03] sorry at the moment I know I know God's
[1:20:06] gonna come through
[1:20:07] there's a bit of a Bad Apple going on
[1:20:08] here and I wouldn't want you know if
[1:20:10] your child's a bit
[1:20:12] you know if the and the transition too
[1:20:15] we don't want a big pile up on the
[1:20:16] corner that's just maybe
[1:20:18] you know don't think if they don't let
[1:20:20] their child around the oh well that's it
[1:20:21] you mustn't you don't love me no
[1:20:24] what's the best option
[1:20:26] they're all bad options you've got to be
[1:20:28] very gracious just go look whatever you
[1:20:30] want yep do it this way do it that way
[1:20:32] okay you've got to be very gracious and
[1:20:34] and this the and it's like when people I
[1:20:37] just want to labor on this one last but
[1:20:38] when when when Financial stuff falls
[1:20:40] apart when it's all gets into negative
[1:20:42] territory there's no good option
[1:20:43] everything's bad just accept it as being
[1:20:45] bad don't think I need I'll take that
[1:20:47] five dollars and listen nitty-gritty hey
[1:20:50] everything's bad man let's just try and
[1:20:52] wrap it up
[1:20:53] move on who cares there's no good option
[1:20:56] right
[1:20:57] and so it's very important that in this
[1:21:00] situation
[1:21:02] and every situation is different one
[1:21:03] child you may think yeah I like that
[1:21:05] other another child you're like oh no I
[1:21:06] don't really want you to go around there
[1:21:07] it's just
[1:21:08] or another one you might think no I
[1:21:09] really feel that you should go and
[1:21:13] okay but be gracious if that happens
[1:21:16] parents and uni so it run on both sides
[1:21:18] the parent of that child needs to say
[1:21:20] look hey this is acknowledge this is the
[1:21:22] situation and this is a challenge other
[1:21:23] parents will have
[1:21:25] and vice versa okay because if you and
[1:21:27] don't don't think anything negative
[1:21:29] about that ideally what we want are two
[1:21:31] uh two children that love the Lord serve
[1:21:33] the Lord of meat together Fellowship
[1:21:35] praise the Lord that's perfect right
[1:21:38] this other stuff's not perfect so don't
[1:21:39] expect this gonna be perfect it's it's
[1:21:42] not there's going to be challenges
[1:21:43] accept it do what you feel you've got to
[1:21:45] do don't judge someone else because they
[1:21:47] did this or that just
[1:21:48] okay because we're all Christians and we
[1:21:50] all just want to make it through but we
[1:21:51] all don't really know what we're doing
[1:21:52] we're just trying to serve the Lord the
[1:21:53] best we can right that's how let's see
[1:21:57] I actually was trying to find this one
[1:21:58] before I'm almost done we've got about
[1:22:01] five more minutes
[1:22:04] okay I actually was looking for this one
[1:22:06] you know here's the appearance and
[1:22:08] there's the Young The Young new parents
[1:22:10] thinking I'm going to do this way better
[1:22:11] than my parents did
[1:22:13] and then you kind of do the first one
[1:22:15] this way
[1:22:17] hey then and then you realize oh man I
[1:22:19] shouldn't have done that so you do you
[1:22:20] pendulum swing and do the other one the
[1:22:22] other way and then you're like wow
[1:22:22] they're actually different I should have
[1:22:23] done that to that one that to that one
[1:22:25] you're like you spend your whole life
[1:22:27] trying to figure it out then it's
[1:22:28] finally all over and you're like man I'm
[1:22:30] just getting this sorted out
[1:22:32] you know and but the reality is
[1:22:36] parenting is a bit like gardening and
[1:22:37] people are like a garden when they're
[1:22:39] small you can sort of just walk through
[1:22:40] the Garden Walk Through open the gate
[1:22:42] and weed you know we weed we we try and
[1:22:44] keep the bad things out and grow the
[1:22:46] good things because we have access when
[1:22:47] they're small we have access to their
[1:22:48] mind and we can allegedly come and go as
[1:22:50] we please in the children let us in
[1:22:52] but you know some children just after a
[1:22:54] while close the gate all right
[1:22:56] I'm good
[1:22:58] other children just leave the gate open
[1:23:00] yeah come on what do you see well that
[1:23:05] eventually we want God in there working
[1:23:07] right because we as parents are trying
[1:23:09] to do all this and that but we say you
[1:23:11] know eventually we're like Lord you just
[1:23:13] I I'm not good at gardening board I've
[1:23:15] tried my best can you now take over and
[1:23:17] start gardening that area Garden them
[1:23:19] Lord and just and see when that happens
[1:23:22] everything the garden's going to turn
[1:23:23] out all right you know when that turns
[1:23:25] out like that but
[1:23:26] but hey at some point the the child may
[1:23:28] just stop letting you in and you you try
[1:23:31] and get in as much as you can you do
[1:23:32] everything you try and coerce him you're
[1:23:34] trying all these things you just can't
[1:23:35] get in
[1:23:36] and then you see we've grown you're like
[1:23:38] no weeds are growing uh let me in now
[1:23:40] you're not coming in
[1:23:42] that's all right
[1:23:45] it's not all right but
[1:23:46] sometimes that's a we do our best okay
[1:23:50] but when we pull out to the bigger
[1:23:51] picture we want God in there
[1:23:54] and all of us believe us for every one
[1:23:55] of everyone here we want God in your
[1:23:57] life that's what we want
[1:24:00] I think God was gracious to us because
[1:24:02] even Billy Paul
[1:24:04] turned away isn't it amazing
[1:24:06] isn't it amazing that the prophet of
[1:24:08] God's son was started to smoke
[1:24:09] cigarettes you think man of all the
[1:24:11] things you know it's like your dad's a
[1:24:13] prophet you're you're just you've seen
[1:24:15] Angels you've seen all this stuff and
[1:24:16] yet you imagine what brother brown felt
[1:24:19] how human he must have felt when he saw
[1:24:21] a vision
[1:24:23] isn't that amazing at a prophet saw a
[1:24:25] vision and then the vision it's his son
[1:24:27] smoking
[1:24:28] like a very spiritual occasion and
[1:24:30] there's his own son smoking a cigarette
[1:24:32] what it's it's an oxymoron so such
[1:24:35] opposite
[1:24:36] it's like man it's
[1:24:38] but you know and then we then we hear
[1:24:40] the story of um Rebecca you know you
[1:24:42] hear the story of Rebecca how she
[1:24:44] you know that wanted to play that they
[1:24:46] probably were playing Beatles songs or
[1:24:48] whatever and then she came home played
[1:24:49] on the piano because the music teacher
[1:24:50] was teaching her and then the mum didn't
[1:24:52] like it and and you know and she said
[1:24:55] and Rebecca just said to him mum what do
[1:24:57] you want me to stay here and be a
[1:24:59] Wallflower all my life and slam the door
[1:25:00] and walked out and you know and the the
[1:25:03] brother Brown was like well I'll show
[1:25:05] here I should get my belt off and you
[1:25:06] know get it pull it back from the yard
[1:25:08] and you know force that gate open I'm
[1:25:10] gonna weed this Garden
[1:25:11] you know but in that situation with
[1:25:14] Billy Paul he said you've got to make a
[1:25:15] choice
[1:25:16] you do that you're out
[1:25:19] make a choice there's one way or the
[1:25:21] other you're going to carry on you're
[1:25:22] out to stand on my Ministry you can't
[1:25:24] stay here but with that's interesting
[1:25:25] with her he said just love her
[1:25:27] just just say it's all right we're going
[1:25:30] to love you anyway everything's all
[1:25:31] right he said he actually applied
[1:25:33] different
[1:25:34] ways to different right
[1:25:38] there's another daughter called Sarah
[1:25:39] you never hear anything about Sarah
[1:25:41] Sierra probably was just one of those
[1:25:43] people that just sort of drove around
[1:25:44] the track afterwards
[1:25:47] you don't hear about Sarah but they they
[1:25:49] have a variety
[1:25:51] that's just how it works
[1:25:55] I'm just going to
[1:25:58] I'm going to wind this up
[1:26:00] thanks for listening and thanks that I
[1:26:02] could thanks for letting me share this
[1:26:04] this thought with you
[1:26:07] um
[1:26:08] I'm going to read really fast okay
[1:26:10] this is about the token
[1:26:15] this is now pulling out and saying what
[1:26:16] what is ours
[1:26:18] then when we pray we must have the token
[1:26:20] present with our prayers as I said and
[1:26:23] now I believe for ourself and apply the
[1:26:24] token to our whole family like in Egypt
[1:26:26] Jericho or either an acts 16 31 which
[1:26:29] was the Jailer we find out that Paul
[1:26:30] told the Roman Centurion believe thou
[1:26:32] and all thy house shall be saved apply
[1:26:34] it to your family if you've got an
[1:26:36] unsaved child lay the token right on top
[1:26:38] of him say Lord God I claim him stay
[1:26:40] right there if you've got a mother or a
[1:26:42] loved one that's lost lay that token on
[1:26:44] them say Lord God I claim it
[1:26:47] but there's always a I would say a catch
[1:26:50] I need to read this as well but you all
[1:26:51] do this anyway right you're all
[1:26:52] believers you can claim all this move
[1:26:54] out move out all of the worldly trash
[1:26:56] out of your house get get ready for it
[1:26:58] burn up your shorts throw your card
[1:27:00] tables away get rid of your cigarettes
[1:27:01] dump your unbelief and your church
[1:27:02] papers in the trash can where they
[1:27:04] belong amen then you're getting ready
[1:27:06] then what what do you do then apply the
[1:27:08] token and prayer with real evidence real
[1:27:10] Faith apply it apply it with confidence
[1:27:12] when you apply the token know that you
[1:27:14] are cleaned up if a house condemn us not
[1:27:16] then we have our request
[1:27:18] see as long as you people are doing them
[1:27:21] things that's wrong how
[1:27:23] you're going to ask God to do anything
[1:27:24] for you when you know you're wrong
[1:27:26] that's the reason why we just stagger up
[1:27:28] and stagger back I'm not saying this to
[1:27:30] hurt I'm saying this to straighten out
[1:27:31] to get things right how are you going to
[1:27:33] build it up voted upon the Charles of a
[1:27:35] Sodom and Gomorrah come back
[1:27:36] associations and ministers have let the
[1:27:38] people do anything and get by and just
[1:27:40] put their name on the book and call them
[1:27:41] this that and the other when it's a
[1:27:43] disgrace and it's got so that faith is
[1:27:46] something that's not even don't even
[1:27:47] very seldom ever know what it even is
[1:27:49] because they've got nothing to really
[1:27:50] anchored into they've got to Hope but
[1:27:52] not a faith you've got to get back to
[1:27:54] everything
[1:27:55] back to everything is combed out and
[1:27:57] cleaned then take your token that you
[1:27:59] know that it's Jesus Christ then you
[1:28:01] then apply it if something don't happen
[1:28:03] there's something wrong go back again
[1:28:05] get the wrong thing in your
[1:28:07] got the wrong thing in your hand he
[1:28:08] promised that he was the one who
[1:28:09] promised it apply it read Ephesians 2
[1:28:11] 12.
[1:28:12] if you're wishing you'll find out there
[1:28:13] I needed to read that because this is
[1:28:16] not so he was in a place where you know
[1:28:17] the it's the denominations were going
[1:28:19] all over the place
[1:28:21] I need to say this don't beat yourself
[1:28:23] up too hard because I believe we're
[1:28:24] Believers and we're actually living that
[1:28:26] way you know like you know we uh I know
[1:28:28] your lifestyle but I had to include that
[1:28:30] in the quote because you've got to
[1:28:31] preach the word of God and that's why I
[1:28:32] said at the start
[1:28:33] the the jailer
[1:28:36] he was actually a just man and he was
[1:28:38] serving God as much as he could and it
[1:28:39] says Hey thine arms have come from
[1:28:40] Memorial before God yeah I I actually
[1:28:43] have respect for your life and honor I
[1:28:44] want to bless you this lady here this is
[1:28:48] um sister Hattie right her children
[1:28:50] weren't serving the lord but I believe
[1:28:52] she loved the Lord and she was every day
[1:28:53] saying Lord can you just do something
[1:28:55] for them and help them but the brother
[1:28:56] Branham said when he was speaking the
[1:28:57] boys were just over in the other room
[1:28:58] snickering and sort of carrying on and
[1:29:00] joking around and not much into it
[1:29:02] but when she when then when brother
[1:29:05] random was speaking she said that's
[1:29:06] nothing but the truth he's in there just
[1:29:08] enjoying the presence of God and then
[1:29:10] that's when the Lord said to you who ask
[1:29:11] whatever you want and you'll get it and
[1:29:12] it was the salvation of her children and
[1:29:15] her boys at that moment repented
[1:29:18] that shows it's God
[1:29:20] she would have tried a lot of effort
[1:29:21] before that but it was God
[1:29:24] I'm almost done here
[1:29:26] this is another one that little fella
[1:29:28] the other night about 14 years old our
[1:29:29] pastor brother Neville he had his hands
[1:29:31] on I'm praying for him the cutest little
[1:29:32] thing now this one here brother Ed
[1:29:34] Dalton seen that happen
[1:29:36] he was praying for his children now
[1:29:37] brother and helped brother Branham a lot
[1:29:39] in the ministry he was was around places
[1:29:40] helping him out
[1:29:42] really loved the Lord you could you
[1:29:43] could see love the Lord and he said when
[1:29:45] they went outside
[1:29:47] he was praying for his children he
[1:29:49] Brethren said I got outside and he
[1:29:50] turned back around and the Holy Spirit
[1:29:51] said speak for Ed's children and I said
[1:29:54] brother Dalton the Holy Spirit tells me
[1:29:55] by that same gift
[1:29:57] that we're looking to be perfectly
[1:29:59] manifested soon I give you your children
[1:30:01] in the name of Jesus Christ and when I
[1:30:03] got when he got home near his daughter
[1:30:04] and son already gave the house to Christ
[1:30:06] just a few miles down in the country
[1:30:07] from me and I think every one of your
[1:30:09] children are saved and filled with the
[1:30:10] Holy Spirit and you know is that right
[1:30:11] brother Dalton there's there any of them
[1:30:14] here with you I had one daughter was
[1:30:16] that the one that was saved right away
[1:30:17] the oldest daughter was saved the next
[1:30:18] morning and every one of his children is
[1:30:20] now saved how the Holy Spirit When God
[1:30:22] says anything he keeps his word now
[1:30:24] how could I have saved those children
[1:30:26] see
[1:30:27] it's not your own words it isn't your
[1:30:29] own thinking
[1:30:31] it's ever what's inspiring you and if
[1:30:33] God's uh and if it's God then it's God's
[1:30:35] word see
[1:30:38] um
[1:30:39] and if you'll just believe it then
[1:30:41] that's all you have to do just believe
[1:30:42] it
[1:30:43] that's brother Dalton
[1:30:45] what effort did he put in he just
[1:30:48] believed
[1:30:49] right
[1:30:50] we're almost there
[1:30:52] we'll just sing one song then we'll
[1:30:53] close the cakes finish at nine
[1:30:55] that's the that's that's the role myself
[1:30:58] imposed rule
[1:31:00] the sister says just pray I have six
[1:31:02] children that I and I ask God to heal
[1:31:04] and save God Of Heaven grant that her
[1:31:06] six children that she desires be saved
[1:31:08] she has heard the testimony of brother
[1:31:09] Dalton his lovely daughter she desires
[1:31:11] her six children father may she have
[1:31:13] them may they meet here in the land
[1:31:14] where there is no night safely protected
[1:31:17] and sheltered by the blood of Jesus
[1:31:18] Christ amen
[1:31:20] two more
[1:31:22] and I'll tell you what I want to do you
[1:31:24] know this is a ladies talking to brother
[1:31:25] Brandon she said Noah took his whole
[1:31:27] family in with him and I want my whole
[1:31:29] family and they they have a little
[1:31:31] conversation that says my husband his
[1:31:32] brother and says yes yes
[1:31:34] and then he said you know he told the
[1:31:35] Roman when he pulled a sword to kill
[1:31:37] himself up at Philippi when he was in
[1:31:38] jail and the earthquake shook the jail
[1:31:39] down he said believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:31:41] Christ and thy house shall be saved did
[1:31:43] you ever hear that thigh and thy house

[1:31:47] salvation for yourself can't you also
[1:31:48] have faith enough for your house God in
[1:31:50] the same way will do it
[1:31:52] then he says and Lord I pray for sister
[1:31:54] Spencer and brother Spencer tonight that
[1:31:55] every child them and their children will
[1:31:57] all be in that glorious Happy Land where
[1:31:59] there will be no sickness or no old age
