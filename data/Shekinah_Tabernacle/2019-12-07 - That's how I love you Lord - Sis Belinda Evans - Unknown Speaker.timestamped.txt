[0:32] poverty you've come and showed me the
[0:36] way
[0:40] in times of pressure and great trials in
[0:45] times of anxiousness and fearful times
[0:49] you have come and given me your peace
[0:57] that's why I
[0:59] [Music]
[1:04] love you
[1:14] that's why
[1:17] [Music]

[1:41] have come and given me joy and straight

[1:53] times of feeling lonely and having grief
[1:57] you have come to comfort me that's why
[2:06] [Music]
[2:12] love you
[2:21] that's why
[2:23] [Music]
[2:29] love you
