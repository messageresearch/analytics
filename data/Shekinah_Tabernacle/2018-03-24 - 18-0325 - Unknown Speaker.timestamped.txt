[28:29] of Solomon amen hallelujah I was there -
[28:32] 14 this is there for behold I will
[28:36] allure her and bring her into the
[28:39] wilderness and speak comfortably under
[28:41] her and I'll give her vineyards from
[28:44] thence and the valley of Achor for a
[28:48] door of hope and she shall sing there as
[28:51] in the days of her youth as in the day
[28:53] when she came out the land of Egypt
[28:55] Aliyah they came out of the land of
[28:57] Egypt they went across the Red Sea they
[29:01] were singing they were shouting amen
[29:05] and it shall be that day saith the Lord
[29:06] that thou shalt thou shalt call me Ishi
[29:10] and shall no no shall call me no more
[29:14] barley so uh she means husband and
[29:16] barley means Lord so they'll show know
[29:18] thou shall call me issue your husband
[29:20] and thou shalt call me no more barley or
[29:22] Lord they means changing change in a
[29:25] relationship for I'll take away the
[29:30] names of Balaam out of her mouth
[29:32] and they they shall no more be
[29:35] remembered by their name and in that day
[29:38] I will make a covenant for them with the
[29:40] beasts of the field with the fowls of
[29:41] heaven and with the creeping things of
[29:43] the ground I'll break the bow and the
[29:45] sword and the battle out of the earth I
[29:48] will make them lie down safely

[30:05] Lord and it shall come to pass in that
[30:07] day I will hear say at the Lord and I'll
[30:11] hear the heavens and they shall hear the
[30:13] earth and the earth shall hear the corn
[30:15] and the wine and the oil and they shall
[30:16] hear Jezreel and I will sew and I will
[30:20] sew her under me in the earth and I will
[30:22] have mercy upon her that had not
[30:24] obtained mercy and I will say to them
[30:27] which were not my people

[30:32] thou art my god
[30:34] Amy I'm sure you can say I'm livin that
[30:36] scripture out hallelujah and then that's
[30:38] got a Song of Solomon chapter 8
[30:57] let's see here this is a man this is
[31:00] great we know the whole Bible is a love
[31:02] story I mean it's all encapsulated in
[31:05] the Song of Solomon the trust you can
[31:08] see yourself in the book it's a Song of
[31:11] Solomon 8 or read verses 5 to 7
[31:17] who was this that Kamath up from the
[31:21] wilderness leaning upon her beloved I
[31:24] raised thee up under the apple trees
[31:26] this is the bridegroom speaking to the
[31:28] bride I'll start again from the
[31:30] beginning who is this that cometh up
[31:31] from the wilderness leaning upon her
[31:33] beloved I raised the up under the apple
[31:35] tree there thy mother brought thee forth
[31:38] there she brought thee forth that bear
[31:40] they set me as a seal upon thine heart
[31:42] as a seal upon thine arm for love as
[31:46] strong as death jealousy as cruel as the
[31:48] grave the coals are of other coals of
[31:50] fire which of the most vehement flame
[31:54] many waters cannot quench love neither
[31:56] can floods drown it if a man would give
[31:59] all the substance of his house for love
[32:01] it shall utterly be contemned
[32:05] I mean let some bow hits in a word of
[32:08] Prayer gracious father's we have read
[32:11] your word this morning lord I just pray
[32:14] father you had come and just take the
[32:15] service under your control father may
[32:18] your Holy Spirit anoint each heart
[32:20] father Lord may you speak to every life
[32:23] Lord may your word love father might
[32:26] become flesh I just pray Lord there be
[32:28] such clarity in your word Lord may you
[32:30] take the service Lord I just want to
[32:32] move myself out of the way that you can
[32:34] speak father we just want to commit the
[32:36] service into your hands Lord you see
[32:38] there are many sick among us Lord hoo
[32:41] hoo Lord who could not make it today
[32:44] for those who are sick here myself with
[32:46] a cold fire let's pray you touch each
[32:48] one Lord may you raise them up Lord I
[32:51] just ask father Lord because we know by
[32:53] your stripes we were healed Lord and as
[32:55] you shed your blood on the cross to save
[32:57] us you also she had your blood on the
[32:58] cross to heal us and Lord we thank you
[33:01] Father for for our healing as well as
[33:03] our salvation so father I pray you would
[33:05] raise us up father in Lord may you lord
[33:08] the per
[33:09] you've sent your word may it be
[33:10] manifested in our lives this morning
[33:12] granted in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[33:15] these things amen I mean God bless you
[33:18] all you may have your seats I want to if
[33:27] I could take a title this morning I want
[33:30] to speak about the we read there in
[33:33] hosea chapter 2 about how that the Lord
[33:36] would would give the people the valley
[33:38] of Achor for a door of hope and she
[33:40] shall sing there as in the days of her
[33:42] youth we have come to us we have come to
[33:45] a time where where the bride of Jesus
[33:47] Christ I believe has has begin to well
[33:50] not begin to but is recognized who she
[33:52] is you know the the scripture the
[33:55] scripture as I said is a love letter it
[33:59] is not a it is not just a book of
[34:01] stories it is a book of love and
[34:04] Christianity is a relationship between
[34:06] God and man as in a marriage between
[34:08] husband and wife
[34:09] and here we have in Hosea that God is
[34:13] prophesying he is speaking to Israel but
[34:16] we know they were just a shadow with it
[34:18] we are the reality that he's saying that
[34:21] there would come a day would when we
[34:23] would no longer call him Lord but we
[34:26] would call him husband I mean because
[34:29] someone someone who addresses someone as
[34:31] Lord has a different relationship to
[34:34] that who was married to him I mean so it
[34:37] come a time where God would elevate his
[34:39] people from being being servants or
[34:42] subjects that he would unite himself
[34:44] with those people that they would become
[34:47] joint heirs with himself
[34:49] Alleluia so there so they came a time
[34:51] now where God was saying in Hosea that
[34:54] I'm going to bring you back to a place
[34:55] I'm going to give it to you as a
[34:57] possession and this was the valley of
[34:59] Achor now I just want to just just lay a
[35:03] bit of a foundation to show you here I
[35:05] know this is familiar to to many of us
[35:07] but when we speak of the Old Testament
[35:09] we are not just finding some stories
[35:11] that maybe fit what we're saying but the
[35:13] Old Testament as a shadow and the New
[35:16] Testament is the reality so what was
[35:18] laid out in the Old Testament was a was
[35:21] a was was pointing to
[35:23] something like if I had my hand and I
[35:25] had a light shining on my hand you'd see
[35:27] the shadow of my hand on the wall and as
[35:30] my hand goes closer to the wall the
[35:33] shadow would begin to look more like my
[35:35] hand right but then there comes a time
[35:37] where you don't see the shadow anymore
[35:39] you see my hand you see the reality
[35:41] right so the Old Testament was the
[35:44] shadow of something that was coming into
[35:46] reality which is the New Testament okay
[35:49] so now so when we talk about the Old
[35:51] Testament we talk about Israel they were
[35:54] living out a shadow of what we would be
[35:57] living out in reality you're following
[36:00] me this is very important because I want
[36:01] you to understand that the old test was
[36:04] not just some history or some law but it
[36:06] still applies today and what the
[36:08] believers faced in the Old Testament is
[36:11] what we are facing today but in a
[36:13] different form
[36:14] and their journey out of out of Egypt
[36:17] under Moses into the Promised Land was a
[36:19] prophecy of a people that would come out
[36:22] of the world and would be placed
[36:24] positionally in the body of Christ and
[36:26] their inheritance hallelujah so now we
[36:29] read here this is and I just want to
[36:33] show you this from Scripture now which
[36:35] it says in Hebrews now Paul is
[36:36] paralleling the journey of Israel out of
[36:41] Egypt under Moses and he's paralleling
[36:43] their journey to the to the believers
[36:46] that he's writing to the Christians that
[36:48] as they journeyed out of the world from
[36:51] from out of Egypt sorry through the
[36:53] wilderness into the Promised Land so we
[36:56] must leave the world we must come out of
[36:59] out of Egypt and come into Christ they
[37:02] meant for now he begins to speak about a
[37:04] rest here I'm going to come around to
[37:09] Hosea but I want to lay these things out
[37:11] a little bit wherefore as the Holy Ghost
[37:13] saith today if you'll hear his voice
[37:14] harden not your hearts as in the
[37:17] provocation of the day of temptation in
[37:19] the wilderness when your father's
[37:20] tempted me proved me so my works 40
[37:23] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[37:25] generation and said they do always earn
[37:27] their heart they have not known my ways
[37:30] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[37:33] enter into my rest
[37:36] while it is said today if you'll hear
[37:39] his voice harden not your hearts as in
[37:41] the provocation for some when they had
[37:43] heard that provoked howbeit not all that
[37:46] came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom
[37:49] was he grieved forty years wasn't not
[37:51] with them that had sent whose carcasses
[37:54] fell in the wilderness and to whom swear
[37:56] he that they should not enter into his
[37:58] rest but to them that believe not so we
[38:01] see that they could not enter in because
[38:04] of unbelief let us therefore fear at
[38:09] least a promise being left unto us of
[38:11] entering into his rest least any of you
[38:13] should seem to come short of it for unto
[38:16] us was the gospel preached as well as
[38:18] unto them but the word preached did not
[38:20] profit them not being mixed with faith
[38:22] in them that heard it for we which have
[38:24] believed to enter into rest as he said
[38:27] as I've sworn in my wrath if they shall
[38:30] enter into my rest although the works
[38:32] were finished from the foundation of the
[38:35] world for he spake in a certain place on
[38:38] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[38:41] rest the seventh day from all his works
[38:43] and in this place again if they shall
[38:46] enter into my rest seeing therefore it
[38:48] remaineth that some must enter therein
[38:51] and they to whom it was first preached
[38:54] entered not in because of unbelief again
[38:56] he limited a certain day saying and
[38:58] David today after so longer time as it
[39:01] said today if you'll hear my voice
[39:02] harden not your hearts for if Jesus had
[39:07] given them rest then would be he not
[39:10] afterwards have spoken of another day
[39:12] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[39:14] people of God for he that entered into
[39:17] his rest he also has ceased from his own
[39:20] works as God did from his let us labor
[39:23] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[39:26] any man should fall after the same
[39:29] example of unbelief now in the Old
[39:32] Testament there was a Sabbath day that
[39:34] they kept and the risk that he's also
[39:37] talking about us entering into the
[39:38] Promised Land there to say that was a
[39:40] type of the rest where they came out of
[39:42] Egypt they went through the wilderness
[39:44] and they had enter into their
[39:45] inheritance which was them entering into
[39:48] but we know that Jesus when he spake
[39:52] because he said no we were just read in
[39:54] Hebrews that that there has there is a
[39:58] risk that that that is for us and it's
[40:01] not keeping a day Amen it's not keeping
[40:04] some holy tradition or keeping some day
[40:07] they had to keep the Sabbath under the
[40:09] Old Testament but we'll read in
[40:10] Colossians that was just a shadow of
[40:13] things to come but Jesus now standing
[40:16] who is the lord of the Sabbath he or the
[40:18] Lord of rest he said at that time jesus
[40:20] answered and said unto him I thank thee
[40:23] O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[40:24] because thou has hid these things from
[40:27] the eyes of wives of the wise and
[40:28] prudent and has to reveal them unto
[40:30] babes even so father for so it seemed
[40:33] good in thy sight all things had
[40:35] delivered unto me by my father and no
[40:38] man knoweth the son but the father
[40:39] neither knoweth any man the father saved
[40:42] the Son and he to whomsoever the son
[40:45] will reveal him and then he says come
[40:48] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[40:51] laden and I will give you rest take my
[40:54] yoke upon you learn of me for I am meek
[40:56] and lowly in heart and you shall find
[40:58] rest for your souls my yoke is easy my
[41:02] yoke is easy and my burden is light so
[41:06] Jesus is now speaking now come unto me
[41:08] and I'll give you rest for yourself he
[41:10] wouldn't have said that if keeping a day
[41:13] or keeping the law was sufficient but
[41:15] that was just a shadow now here he was
[41:17] to give the reality I'm going to give
[41:19] you rest for your souls come unto me and
[41:22] take my yoke upon you hallelujah now we
[41:25] understand from the scripture that the
[41:27] true rest of God is when you truly enter
[41:29] into Christ when you are born again by
[41:32] the Spirit of God you enter into rest
[41:35] amen so if you've truly met him you have
[41:38] entered into rest are you all following
[41:40] me the true Sabbath is not keeping a day
[41:43] the true Sabbath or the rest Sabbath
[41:46] means rest as when you are fully when
[41:48] you are sealed into the kingdom by the
[41:50] Holy Ghost that is the rest hallelujah
[41:54] now he says and Isaiah 28 speaking of
[41:58] this day that would come he c is for
[42:00] precept
[42:01] must be upon precept precept upon
[42:03] precept line upon line line upon line
[42:05] here a little and there a little
[42:08] for what stammering lips and another
[42:09] tongue will he speak to this people to
[42:11] whom he said this is the rest when he
[42:15] may cause the weary to rest and this is
[42:17] the refreshing yet they would not hear
[42:19] so with the stammering lips and another
[42:21] tongue I'll speak to these people and he
[42:23] says this is the rest and then when the
[42:26] Lord came down on the day of Pentecost
[42:28] and filled 120 in the upper room I mean
[42:31] there was God now come and dwelling in
[42:34] his church giving the rest to their
[42:36] souls giving him the real Sabbath and
[42:38] they am and then when that happened they
[42:41] you going to read the book of Acts they
[42:42] came out of the upper room they were all
[42:44] trying to be pious and things that the
[42:46] Bible says they were acting like drunk
[42:48] people as with stammering lips no the
[42:50] tongue they're rejoicing hallelujah this
[42:53] is the promise of profit you know you
[42:55] know that was given by the Prophet Joel
[42:56] I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh
[42:59] Pilate is the fulfillment I'm entered
[43:01] into race they were happy about it
[43:03] hallelujah they're rejoicing about it I
[43:06] mean because they entered into the true
[43:08] race hallelujah it says in Colossians 2
[43:12] it says let no man therefore judge you
[43:14] in meat or in drink or a respect of a
[43:17] holy day or a new moon or Sabbath days
[43:20] for which of the shadows of things to
[43:22] come but the body is of Christ so Paul
[43:25] is already telling them don't let any
[43:27] man judge you and me to drink her I keep
[43:29] the stay or I don't keep this day I have
[43:31] this feast or whatever more a New Moon's
[43:33] or sabbath days that's a shadow I'm it's
[43:37] just a shadow pointing to a reality so
[43:39] the shadow was keeping a day but the
[43:41] reality is entering into eternal rest
[43:43] where God will come in and seal you into
[43:46] the kingdom hallelujah so that is that
[43:49] is the so I read all that to show you
[43:52] now that what Israel went through from
[43:56] from going from Egypt into the Promised
[43:58] Land as a shadow or you're pointing to
[44:02] what we are going to do in reality right
[44:04] this is the Old Testament is more than
[44:07] stories and laws and and history it's
[44:10] more than that it's a prophecy speaking
[44:13] of it speaking of it in time
[44:15] people Amen so now here we are
[44:19] so they journeyed now so they journeyed
[44:22] from they journeyed from from Egypt
[44:24] under the Ministry of Moses and God God
[44:27] called them out because he wanted to
[44:29] unite himself with him he wanted to join
[44:32] himself with his people so he called
[44:33] them out of slavery I mean said send a
[44:36] prophet and to enter and to Egypt the
[44:39] prophet Moses and that was to deliver
[44:41] them out of the out from under the
[44:43] taskmasters whips from you know from
[44:45] under slavery call them out amen because
[44:48] he wanted to unite himself with those
[44:50] people that not only that that they
[44:52] would he would be their God but he would
[44:55] say these are my people
[44:56] and I identify myself with my people
[44:58] hallelujah so he called them out now and
[45:01] they journeyed from from from Egypt and
[45:04] they Jenny you across the Red Sea and
[45:06] they went into the Promised Land but now
[45:09] when they entered into the promised land
[45:10] the land was sealed up the inheritance
[45:13] was sealed up hallelujah so now they
[45:16] head to the first way for the for the
[45:18] land to come open as Jericho had to be
[45:21] taken so Jericho was the interest to the
[45:24] lane you're following me they had to
[45:26] take you know I'll tell you this friends
[45:28] maybe I'll jump ahead to it back in
[45:32] Genesis when the patriarchs were being
[45:34] named and the inspiration they were
[45:36] called certain names call them Natalie
[45:39] or Reuben or GERD or as a car or
[45:42] Benjamin or Manasseh or 'iframe or
[45:44] whatever the names were I mean those
[45:46] inspiration their name was actually
[45:48] identifying where they'd be placed in
[45:51] the land I mean where they would be
[45:53] positionally placed was based on the
[45:55] name that they were given and so when
[45:57] when Joshua comes down to his ministry
[45:59] and his ministry was to place the tribes
[46:02] and certain parts of the land I mean he
[46:05] was guided by the Holy Ghost
[46:06] where where where the blessings that
[46:09] they were placed on the patriarchs I
[46:12] mean back in Genesis were identifying
[46:14] where they would be in the land and by
[46:16] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[46:18] he's his Manasseh you're up here Ephraim
[46:20] you're down here dad you're here Zebulon
[46:23] you're here you know he was he was
[46:25] placing them because their name
[46:27] we're pointing to this is your
[46:29] inheritance hallelujah their names we're
[46:32] saying this is where you gonna live this
[46:34] is your position in the promised land
[46:37] hallelujah now you say well what does
[46:40] that got to do with us now we are called
[46:42] by a new name Amen we are called by a
[46:45] new name brother Branham would come into
[46:47] the first seal and he would he would he
[46:52] would begin to identify he would begin
[46:56] to talk about the first seal but he's
[46:58] now when when the lamb takes the book of
[47:01] revelations chapter four and five it's
[47:03] it's our inheritance being everything
[47:06] Adam lost now that went into the hands
[47:09] of the original owner I mean gee our
[47:12] Lord Jesus our lamb the second Adam he
[47:14] purchased our salvation on Calvary but
[47:16] then he had to claim back everything
[47:18] that Adam lost so he could give it back
[47:20] to Adams
[47:21] redeemed race I mean our inheritance so
[47:25] now when when when the seals are open
[47:27] the Prophet messenger is standing on the
[47:29] earth and his commission go back to
[47:31] Jeffersonville preached the seven seals
[47:32] out of the book of Revelation did now
[47:35] what happens is the lambs take in the
[47:37] book and he's now beginning to give an
[47:39] inheritance back to the people and so in
[47:42] order to give an inheritance it's going
[47:44] to be a name change are you following me
[47:46] so he says in the first seal
[47:48] he says it's sealed up the Lambs blood
[47:50] paid the price that thundered when he
[47:52] spoke it out and when he did a white
[47:54] horse rider started out it was and still
[47:56] it was assembled now watch he said it
[47:59] would be known in the last day but it
[48:00] comes forth in a church symbol you
[48:03] understand at church it comes forth in a
[48:04] symbol of a church that they know there
[48:08] is a seal but just what it was yet they
[48:10] don't know because it's a white horse
[48:12] rider and it's only to be revealed in
[48:14] the last day when this actual seal is
[48:16] broken broken to whom not to not to
[48:19] Christ but to the church notice oh my
[48:21] this makes me tremble
[48:23] I hope the church truly understands it
[48:25] see see what I mean you people I'm gonna
[48:27] call you bride see that you'll
[48:30] understand it the voice is a thunder the
[48:32] voice came from where from the throne
[48:34] with a lamb they just left us the
[48:36] Intercity she's I'm gonna call you bride
[48:37] so you understand what's go
[48:39] because it's a that's a title or a name
[48:42] and it designates a position or an
[48:44] inheritance I mean just let's talk about
[48:47] the Old Testament tribes they were
[48:49] called certain names because they're
[48:50] going to be placed in certain part of
[48:51] the body amen so now as he so now as our
[48:55] inheritance is being read out to us to
[48:57] the Bride of Christ now so now the
[48:59] Prophet saying I'm not going to call you
[49:01] church anymore I'm going to call you
[49:03] bride that you'll understand this
[49:04] because now the inheritance is open up
[49:07] and if there's a name Amen
[49:09] it designates a position and so we are
[49:12] predestinated to a position in Christ
[49:17] I'll just go keep sipping nose with the
[49:22] tar start to fall off I'll just read
[49:23] Greece it will be fine but you see how
[49:25] our name represents a position is
[49:28] everyone following what I'm saying
[49:30] so Manasseh Manasseh was called Manasseh
[49:32] because he was had to live in a certain
[49:34] inheritance that's why he was called
[49:36] that because his name was a prophecy
[49:38] this is where your four bit I mean this
[49:41] is where your descendants are gonna live
[49:43] it was a prophecy saying this is where
[49:45] they'll be or or Joseph or I mean I mean
[49:48] you know Judah or any of the tribes it
[49:51] was prophecy saying their name will mean
[49:53] they live in this part of the land and
[49:55] so now when God says I'll call you
[49:58] bright now he's saying I'm going to give
[50:00] you a different inheritance to what the
[50:02] church may have had
[50:04] Alleluia so it's a prophecy now saying
[50:06] you're going to dwell in a certain
[50:08] position I mean because we know our
[50:10] inheritance is not a piece of real
[50:12] estate like Israel is the state our
[50:15] position I mean our inheritance is our
[50:17] position in Christ hallelujah so now
[50:20] he's saying now I'm gonna call you bride
[50:22] so we are predestinated unto the
[50:26] adoption it says in Ephesians 1 blessed
[50:30] be the God and father our Lord Jesus
[50:32] Christ who has blessed us with all
[50:34] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[50:36] in Christ according as he has chosen us
[50:39] in him before the foundation of the
[50:41] world that we should be holy and without
[50:43] blame before him in love amen having
[50:47] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[50:50] children by Jesus
[50:53] to himself according to the good
[50:55] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[50:57] the glory of His grace for in Heath made
[50:59] us accepted in the beloved now we
[51:02] understand adoption in the Bible as not
[51:06] is not say going to China or going to
[51:09] some family that's not a blood relation
[51:11] to you and and they're now signing some
[51:13] paperwork saying now this child is now
[51:15] part of my family
[51:17] that's my Bible adoption Bible adoption
[51:20] is the placing of a child that has been
[51:23] birthed into the family and to their
[51:25] position in the family that's adoption
[51:27] that's bible adoption hallelujah son our
[51:30] Bible adoption is now we're birthed into
[51:32] the kingdom by the Holy Ghost and then
[51:34] he himself places us in our position in
[51:37] him amen so we are predestinated unto
[51:40] the adoption of sons hallelujah this is
[51:44] our our destiny has been predetermined
[51:46] amen you understand what I'm saying so
[51:49] so God is telling you I mean that your
[51:52] destiny is that you will be placed as a
[51:54] son or a daughter of God hallelujah this
[51:59] is what your destiny is they mean so
[52:02] just like he said
[52:04] just like the Hebrew mother said
[52:05] Manasseh when Manasseh was born that was
[52:08] now predestinated Manasseh was
[52:10] predestinated to dwell in that part of
[52:12] the land because of the name that was
[52:14] given because because the child was
[52:15] burst into the family I mean so now it
[52:19] was predestinated to be placed in that
[52:22] part of the body just like the Bride of
[52:24] Christ were being predestinated unto the
[52:26] adoption of sons hallelujah that means
[52:29] we're not a servant I mean that means
[52:31] we're not just some hired help
[52:32] hallelujah
[52:33] but that means we're a part of the
[52:34] children of God and we're part of his
[52:37] family by His grace I mean out of every
[52:40] kindred nation and tongue hallelujah God
[52:43] has predestinated a people
[52:44] I mean upon the earth I'll not leave
[52:47] them in slavery I'll not leave them in
[52:48] darkness I mean I want to leave them
[52:50] spiritually dead or blind but I'll
[52:52] awaken them by my word I mean they will
[52:55] know they will know as they are knowing
[52:58] amen hallelujah God wants to know God
[53:00] wants you to know who you are I mean he
[53:03] doesn't want you just to think well I'm
[53:04] from certain country this is my family
[53:06] this is my socio-economic place in the
[53:10] world I mean that's not what it's about
[53:12] God wants you to understand you're my
[53:14] child and then you're my son in my
[53:16] daughter
[53:17] hallelujah you're part of my family amen
[53:21] but you see now it's more than just
[53:23] having little children
[53:24] I mean God wants to marry a woman he's
[53:27] looking for a people to marry to a men
[53:30] to unite himself with I mean to say this
[53:32] is my wife this is the feminist part of
[53:35] me hallelujah that's what he's wanting
[53:38] to do they mean this way he says now I
[53:42] no longer call you search I call you
[53:44] bride that you'll understand it there
[53:46] you understand what's going on lelou
[53:50] yeah now as I said your Jericho was the
[53:57] entrance into the land and the church
[54:00] has come out of come out of the Dark
[54:02] Ages they've been under under the
[54:04] Reformation under under Martin Luther
[54:07] and and the others of the Reformation
[54:09] that came out the Dark Ages
[54:10] and the churches journeyed the churches
[54:13] journeyed from frot from Egypt through
[54:17] the wilderness and then they came to a
[54:19] point in these last days were nowhere to
[54:21] go for this the fullness the inheritance
[54:23] hallelujah
[54:24] but now the entrance of the of the
[54:27] kingdom had to be opened and so as
[54:29] Jericho it was Strada shut up because of
[54:33] the children of Israel no one went out
[54:35] and I went in so this was the entrance
[54:36] into the land Joshua had to take Joshua
[54:39] had to open the land to the people I
[54:41] mean this is this was the entrance and
[54:43] they crossed the Jordan I mean but the
[54:45] book was sealed I mean the land the
[54:47] inheritance was sealed up
[54:49] I mean without taking without taking
[54:51] Jericho they couldn't be placed in there
[54:54] in their position in the land I mean so
[54:56] now it was sealed up and then they take
[54:59] and then you know the rest of the story
[55:01] God comes down as the captain of the
[55:03] hosts of the Lord takes over the battle
[55:06] hallelujah takes over the battle amen he
[55:08] begins to instruct Joshua what to do
[55:10] maybe just like God comes
[55:12] and takes over our battle hey Joshua
[55:14] goes out he's trying to work out how can
[55:16] I open this how can I open this
[55:18] inheritance to the people amen brother
[55:20] Branham was given a Joshua Commission I
[55:22] mean to to take the people across Jordan
[55:25] into their position in Christ hallelujah
[55:28] and Joshua stand is saying how am I
[55:30] going to take the land and a man comes
[55:32] with a sword drawn and Joshua says you
[55:34] forced her against us he says I'm not
[55:35] for you I'm not against you but I come
[55:38] as the captain of the hosts of the Lord
[55:39] he says he says I'm not on your side
[55:41] you're on my side I mean I'm in charge
[55:44] of this battle it's the same thing with
[55:45] us now God we're not on yeah I mean our
[55:48] God is our captain he he's come to fight
[55:51] your battles I mean if you can just get
[55:53] your humanity out to one side I mean God
[55:56] can live hallelujah
[55:58] so now Allu yeah amen oh I've been
[56:06] rejoicing hallelujah I mean for now yeah
[56:10] and then they take they take Jericho so
[56:13] now the land is unsealed I mean the land
[56:15] comes open the inheritance comes open I
[56:18] mean so now what was sitting you could
[56:20] say in Scrolls that was given on Mount
[56:22] Sinai could now be lived I mean it could
[56:25] now be manifested in their lives
[56:27] whereas more than just then your Moses
[56:29] saying you go possess the land and when
[56:31] you go possess the land do this and this
[56:33] and this as well just hearing ministry
[56:35] but now they could possess or they could
[56:37] live out what Moses gave them to do they
[56:40] meant for now Joshua he says after
[56:43] Jericho has been destroyed he says in
[56:46] Joshua during them at that time saying
[56:48] cursed be the man before the Lord that
[56:50] raises up and builds the city Jericho
[56:53] and he shall lay the foundation there
[56:55] I've been his firstborn and in his
[56:56] youngest son he shall set up the gates
[56:58] so the Lord was with Joshua and his fame
[57:00] was noise throughout all the country I
[57:03] mean so he says cursed be the man who
[57:05] tries to seal up the promised land again
[57:07] amen
[57:08] cursed be that one who tries to say the
[57:10] book is sealed that the inheritance is
[57:13] not for you it's for another time for a
[57:15] future time cursed be the man that seals
[57:17] up the book hallelujah because the
[57:20] inheritance has come up but in the same
[57:21] time I mean we know exactly everything
[57:23] that is allotted to us
[57:25] hallelujah we're not
[57:26] Singh what our position in Christ is or
[57:29] if we more than overcomers we know we're
[57:31] more than overcomers and then we know
[57:33] that we're more than conquerors through
[57:34] him that loved us I mean we know our
[57:36] sins are all washed away I mean we know
[57:39] we don't have to do penance and do some
[57:40] pilgrimage someplace and try and pay our
[57:43] way out of out of hell or whatever
[57:44] whatever nonsense we know jesus paid it
[57:47] all and then we know we're without sin
[57:49] without spot or wrinkle washed in the
[57:52] blood of lamb hallelujah
[57:54] hey people get excited about all
[57:56] different kinds of things what about
[57:57] eternal faith what about things that
[57:59] really matter in life hallelujah so we
[58:03] know our position we know the devil's
[58:05] under our feet I mean we know is
[58:06] defeated that day on Calvary hallelujah
[58:09] I mean it's like Miriam and you know
[58:12] when they when they crossed the Red Sea
[58:13] and they and their slave masters were
[58:15] did behind them they begin to dance they
[58:18] began to rejoice I mean the ones that
[58:20] were whipping me and beating me a dead I
[58:22] mean they tried to follow me but they
[58:25] couldn't follow me hallelujah we're
[58:27] going to recognize the spirit badness in
[58:29] the world I mean I mean they didn't bury
[58:32] hallelujah and now whoever shot two
[58:34] agents or we're not a bunch of slaves I
[58:36] mean as God told Moses and children of
[58:40] Israel go take the lame I'm in you to
[58:43] the fight for every inch of your
[58:44] inheritance but go take it I give you
[58:46] the slain hallelujah and we have to
[58:49] recognize Amen if the enemy's being
[58:51] drowned in the Red Sea behind us I mean
[58:53] the enemy in front of us will be like
[58:55] the ones behind us hallelujah
[58:57] I mean I wouldn't be too worried oh just
[59:00] go take your go take your inheritance
[59:04] hallelujah but then they come to a I
[59:07] this is really wrong oh you know where I
[59:09] want to get to they come to the city of
[59:11] AI so now the books off I mean the
[59:13] inheritance is open they begin to
[59:15] journey they've taken Jericho the next
[59:17] place they come to his AI but before AI

[59:22] Babylonian diamond in the gold wedge in
[59:24] the silver he took it from he took her
[59:27] from Jericho and he hid it under his you
[59:29] know you know in his team and so now
[59:31] when they're going to take AI now I mean
[59:34] they lose the battle and Joshua says
[59:36] what's going on we call a halt
[59:37] we're to find out what's wrong because
[59:39] they were
[59:40] I must define a whole campaign without
[59:41] losing a man I mean I promise you you're
[59:44] wherever you set your feet you will
[59:46] possess it hallelujah so he was told you
[59:49] will not lose it's the same thing we're

[1:00:05] the Spirit
[1:00:06] I mean press against the enemy
[1:00:08] hallelujah we will that last him
[1:00:10] hallelujah amen and we're not called to
[1:00:13] just have some trench warfare amen build
[1:00:17] our position and bunkers and say well I
[1:00:19] believe this and I'll stay with this and
[1:00:21] I'll stay with this wherever we're
[1:00:23] called to advance
[1:00:24] we're cool to take the whole word I mean
[1:00:26] we call the tank our whole adherence
[1:00:28] police they come to AI now and then they
[1:00:31] lose the battle and then any Joshua says
[1:00:34] we're gonna call a stop
[1:00:35] I mean call a halt and then they cast
[1:00:37] lots and they come down and it comes
[1:00:39] down to Aiken
[1:00:41] who's the one who took the Babylonian
[1:00:42] garment and the gold wedge and the
[1:00:45] silver and in Jericho and then now
[1:00:48] Joshua Joshua and Israel they they take
[1:00:53] that sent out of the nation and they do
[1:00:55] this in the valley of Achor you may say
[1:00:59] well what's that good to do with what
[1:01:00] we're talking about I'll go back to here
[1:01:01] again so I'll give thee I will get thee
[1:01:11] I'll give her their vineyards from
[1:01:14] thence and the valley of Achor for a
[1:01:16] door of hope and she shall sing thee now
[1:01:20] the valley of Achor was where akin was
[1:01:21] dealt with and the sins that were
[1:01:23] holding back the sins that were holding
[1:01:25] back the people from taking the risks
[1:01:27] and lay and God is telling the bride I
[1:01:29] will give this place as your position
[1:01:32] Amen that you all know you possess this
[1:01:34] place where passion has been done away
[1:01:36] with in the land
[1:01:37] I mean that it's no longer holding you
[1:01:39] back but now it's a memorial that God
[1:01:42] has dealt with us now you're gonna
[1:01:44] advance and take the rest of land only
[1:01:46] there's been a breakout friends I mean
[1:01:48] the devil can't ride all this within me
[1:01:50] you know you know we may have formed a
[1:01:52] beachhead roulette
[1:01:52] right sir hallelujah I mean God's dealt

[1:02:08] why should you hold it against yourself
[1:02:10] why should you hold it against yourself

[1:02:14] I'll give you this as a position
[1:02:16] hallelujah Amen hallelujah so now and
[1:02:22] then and he says that she'll sing there
[1:02:24] as in the day she came out of Egypt I
[1:02:26] mean the day she came out of Egypt I
[1:02:28] mean she crosses the red red sea you
[1:02:30] talk about a Pentecostal Jubilee
[1:02:32] hallelujah because it would became a
[1:02:34] reality that the enemy was dead that's
[1:02:37] why they sung that's why they shouted
[1:02:39] that's why they danced because they knew
[1:02:41] their enemy was defeated and was dead
[1:02:43] behind them hallelujah says that's why
[1:02:45] you shall sing there and because our
[1:02:47] enemies been defeated hallelujah this

[1:04:09] we're not waiting for the inheritance to
[1:04:11] come down it's already happened I mean
[1:04:13] this is not a sealed book anymore we're
[1:04:16] probing at things theologians trying to
[1:04:18] probe God comes and says this is what
[1:04:20] you are God says this is what I've done
[1:04:22] for you hallelujah is not a mystery
[1:04:24] anymore it's been revealed hallelujah
[1:04:28] who's this my beloved who who is this
[1:04:31] that leans upon the arm of her beloved I
[1:04:33] mean this is the one who who's given a
[1:04:36] winning band of unmerited predestinated
[1:04:40] grace before the foundation of the world
[1:04:42] hallelujah talking about you hallelujah
[1:04:46] I mean God listen to invisible union of
[1:04:50] the bride in Christ that's glorious I
[1:04:54] mean because he's declaring now there's
[1:04:56] a union going on there's a marriage why
[1:04:59] did Jesus die to marry a people it's all
[1:05:03] about relationship the Bible Allu yeah
[1:05:07] now I will go back to where we were
[1:05:11] where you'll no longer call me Lord but
[1:05:15] you shall call me husband you've got to
[1:05:19] recognize him as your husband he said
[1:05:21] never been married I mean you'll know
[1:05:23] what it's like to be married when you
[1:05:24] when you marry him hallelujah it's not
[1:05:27] just some rule or some distant person
[1:05:29] can I come and speak to you now is it
[1:05:31] okay you know it's like no husband
[1:05:34] hallelujah
[1:05:35] I need you and then he's there you know
[1:05:39] we give God purpose have you thought
[1:05:41] this is not way out of left field you
[1:05:43] know we give God purpose you know we
[1:05:45] give God God was there before there was
[1:05:48] anything created before the earth angels
[1:05:50] or any molecule and is there alone God
[1:05:53] knows what it's like to be lonely he's
[1:05:55] he's there alone in eternity with his
[1:05:58] great thoughts and he begins to express
[1:06:00] himself then finally it comes down this
[1:06:02] atom and a garden and paradise and then
[1:06:05] God is looking at Adam and he's actually
[1:06:06] speaking about himself as saying it's
[1:06:08] not good that man should be alone
[1:06:10] because he's alone
[1:06:13] and and Adams loneliness is a reflection
[1:06:15] of his loneliness and he's I need to
[1:06:18] express myself
[1:06:19] God wants to express himself God wants
[1:06:21] to make himself knowing but he needs a
[1:06:23] people to have a relationship with to
[1:06:25] express himself to he wasn't just
[1:06:27] satisfied with having a bunch of animals
[1:06:29] on the earth he one of the people he
[1:06:30] wanted someone on his level hallelujah
[1:06:33] and so he made Adam he says this is not
[1:06:35] good after then it was very good or good
[1:06:38] but now this is not good
[1:06:39] something's gone wrong well it hasn't
[1:06:40] gone wrong but in his mind this is not
[1:06:42] good I'm gonna fix this and then he puts
[1:06:45] Adam to sleep he takes a feminist part
[1:06:47] of his spurt out of him and he takes a
[1:06:50] part of Adams body and makes the female
[1:06:53] body he puts a finished part of Adams
[1:06:55] spirit into Eve and she wakes up
[1:06:58] Adam wakes up and then we're now Adam
[1:07:01] sees he says I see a part of me oh yeah
[1:07:05] I don't see a different animal I don't
[1:07:07] see whatever the closest was I don't see
[1:07:09] the serpent which was the closest to the
[1:07:11] man I don't see an animal was different
[1:07:13] I see part of me and they were called
[1:07:16] Adam before the fall they were called
[1:07:18] Adam because they were one one person in
[1:07:21] two bodies because his here's the man
[1:07:24] and here's the woman and they make the
[1:07:25] hole they make the one person hallelujah
[1:07:29] you know this is saying about how you
[1:07:31] talk about your spouse especially meant
[1:07:32] the woman is the better part of me the
[1:07:34] better half of me holy and that's not
[1:07:37] half Rob this is what Adam could have
[1:07:41] said about Eve his here's the other half
[1:07:42] of me which completes me
[1:07:44] amen and it's the same thing with us in
[1:07:46] God now God created a bride he created a
[1:07:50] people and he didn't want them to be
[1:07:52] groveling up his steps thinking will
[1:07:54] will I be accepted
[1:07:56] will I be even thought of you know will
[1:07:59] he turn and look at me that's not what
[1:08:00] God wanted us to be MMB would but but he
[1:08:03] wanted us to be now here's my husband
[1:08:06] because he wanted to express himself God
[1:08:08] loves to express that's why this this
[1:08:10] universe is that God could express
[1:08:12] himself he put as he wrote the Bible in
[1:08:15] the stars
[1:08:16] he wrote the Bible of nature you see
[1:08:18] death burial resurrection and the change
[1:08:20] of seasons I mean God is revealing
[1:08:22] himself a nature he reveals himself in
[1:08:24] the heaven
[1:08:25] he doesn't just want to stop there he
[1:08:27] wants to reveal himself personally to
[1:08:28] you
[1:08:29] and that you would know him in a
[1:08:30] personal way I mean that you would know
[1:08:33] him better than maybe you know yourself
[1:08:35] hallelujah
[1:08:37] it's like Esther come to the book of
[1:08:39] Esther she's all worried I've got to go
[1:08:41] before the King oh here
[1:08:43] I'm afraid to go before the one that's
[1:08:45] you know that loves me that I found
[1:08:49] grace in his sight you read the book of
[1:08:51] Esther says the king is to found the
[1:08:53] Grace in the side of the king it wasn't
[1:08:56] her doing anything that was particularly
[1:08:58] that mattered
[1:08:59] she found grace in her sight he
[1:09:03] following me she was wise because she
[1:09:05] listened to Haggai and hagar knew the
[1:09:07] heart of the king and that's why she
[1:09:09] arrayed herself in a certain way I mean
[1:09:11] but ultimately it was because the king I
[1:09:13] mean when when he saw Esther she found
[1:09:16] grace in his sight but now so she's
[1:09:18] afraid now I've got to go before him and
[1:09:21] I haven't been summoned and this could
[1:09:23] mean Dean and this is her husband who
[1:09:26] doesn't what spouse doesn't want to be
[1:09:28] around the other spouse something's very
[1:09:31] wrong if you don't want to be around
[1:09:33] your husband or your wife your that's
[1:09:35] the one person you want to have the most
[1:09:37] around you so she goes in before the
[1:09:40] king she needs to understand
[1:09:42] don't call me Lord call me husband she
[1:09:46] has to come to a place in her walk that
[1:09:48] he is more husband than the Lord he
[1:09:51] followed me and so she goes in and of
[1:09:53] course she finds favor in his sight ask
[1:09:56] what you will even up to half the
[1:09:58] kingdom and that doesn't mean that would
[1:10:00] have split the Empire and to means I
[1:10:02] make you join here with me
[1:10:04] hallelujah it's Adele we have two
[1:10:07] friends you got a look at him in a very
[1:10:09] different way he's not some distant God
[1:10:11] someplace that the church world tries to
[1:10:13] make him that's not why he died on the
[1:10:15] cross he didn't done the cross to be
[1:10:17] some distant God someplace I mean but he
[1:10:19] died I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:10:21] end of the world and my blood cleanses
[1:10:23] you that I can do well in you amen let's
[1:10:29] go I want to go do this is the promise I
[1:10:33] mean I'll give her vineyards and the
[1:10:36] valley of Achor for a door of hope
[1:10:38] it's a door of hope now shall sing there
[1:10:42] what's it now hoping the bibles and
[1:10:44] expectation it's not it's not like I
[1:10:46] pray you'd never don't do it that's not
[1:10:48] like buying a lottery ticket and say
[1:10:50] well I hope I win
[1:10:51] that's not Bible huh hope and the
[1:10:53] Bible's and expectation that it's going
[1:10:56] to happen so I will give this valley for
[1:10:58] a door of expectation hallelujah and
[1:11:01] this is a door of expectation because
[1:11:03] there are God has done done away with
[1:11:05] this that we can continue to take the
[1:11:07] fullness of the land that's down
[1:11:09] expectation I mean this has been the sin
[1:11:11] has been dealt with now we can advance

[1:11:20] day behold I stand at the door and knock

[1:11:29] come into him not I will be next to him
[1:11:32] old coming to him I will dwell in him If
[1:11:35] any man hear my voice is why the voice
[1:11:36] of the seventh angel so important is the
[1:11:38] voice of God to this generation
[1:11:40] amen it's a love Alleluia and he open if
[1:11:43] you open the door I will come into him I
[1:11:45] will come and dwell in them and will sup
[1:11:48] with him and he with me
[1:11:50] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:11:52] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:11:54] overcame and sit down with my father in
[1:11:57] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[1:11:59] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:12:01] churches now so he says I will come in
[1:12:05] to him and will sup with him now I took
[1:12:13] this both ways the word sup here it
[1:12:19] means to dine that is the principle or
[1:12:23] evening meal we're in the evening time
[1:12:27] we're in the evening time this is the
[1:12:29] principle feast this is the main part of
[1:12:32] the meal of the day
[1:12:33] hallelujah I will come and dwell in him
[1:12:36] and we're going to have a communion
[1:12:37] we're gonna have a relationship holy
[1:12:40] it's not just gonna be a working
[1:12:41] relationship this is a love relationship
[1:12:44] Pauline this is a marriage I mean
[1:12:46] there's a principle feast I mean we
[1:12:48] don't just live off man shall not live
[1:12:50] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:12:53] proceeds out of the mouth of God and we
[1:12:54] will get a whole buffet table hallelujah
[1:12:57] probably the whole tape load of food
[1:12:59] hello Lewis the principal it's the
[1:13:02] principal or evening meal and also when
[1:13:05] I thought of sup now this is just me but
[1:13:08] it's like when I don't know brother
[1:13:12] Steve Bristol Meechum listeners in his
[1:13:14] sermon about why the cup I didn't listen
[1:13:16] to the whole thing but was wonderful
[1:13:17] what I heard but it's now when we know
[1:13:20] when a Jewish man traditionally he goes
[1:13:23] to get engaged he doesn't give a ring he
[1:13:25] gives a cup he gives a cup and now the
[1:13:28] acceptance of the of the like the will
[1:13:31] you marry me is now the woman takes the
[1:13:33] cup and drinks it and then the man takes
[1:13:36] it back and he smashes the cup because
[1:13:38] he can't give it to anyone else now
[1:13:40] Alleluia so now this is this is just me
[1:13:43] when I read this I will sup with him and
[1:13:44] he with me I mean this is this is a
[1:13:48] communion I will come and unite myself
[1:13:50] with these people
[1:13:52] hallelujah I'll come and unite myself
[1:13:54] because if he says I will come into him
[1:13:56] I will come and dwell in them that's a
[1:13:58] uniting amen and the bride and Christ is
[1:14:02] uniting in this day hallelujah
[1:14:05] Amy this is not only the main the main
[1:14:07] meal of the day
[1:14:08] it's a uniting time Alleluia
[1:14:12] and so now they're so we're living in an
[1:14:16] hour where we no longer caught we do
[1:14:18] call the blood because he's still Lord
[1:14:19] but we call him husband
[1:14:20] our main relationship with him as
[1:14:23] husband hello Lou yeah I knew now what a
[1:14:29] day to be alive it is a return and
[1:14:40] Jubilee that's why it's so important you
[1:14:43] say well why people call talk about the
[1:14:45] bride the bride the bride because we're
[1:14:47] going to know who we are in him that's
[1:14:49] why he died the purpose that he died for
[1:14:51] is that you would know who you are I
[1:14:52] mean that we're no longer a slave or no
[1:14:56] longer a servant he doesn't want
[1:14:57] servants he wants a wife he wants to
[1:15:00] unite himself and remember it's all his
[1:15:02] doing it's all his doing Amy and it says
[1:15:05] if any man
[1:15:06] as I said as we read there so I'm just
[1:15:08] going to skip back to it if any man hear
[1:15:11] my voice and open the door he's the one
[1:15:14] that comes he's the one that gives thee
[1:15:16] you know he's the one that comes first
[1:15:17] and he sends his voice upon the earth
[1:15:20] all we have to do is respond hallelujah
[1:15:23] because this is purpose for sending his
[1:15:25] voice upon the earth I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:15:27] come and dwell in a people they will sup
[1:15:30] with me and meet with them hallelujah so
[1:15:33] it's all his doing I mean who is this
[1:15:35] that leans on the arm of her beloved
[1:15:36] this is a leg this is a woman that was
[1:15:39] was once United to the world hallelujah
[1:15:43] that was once married to the world I
[1:15:45] mean but God came and killed that Union
[1:15:47] hallelujah the first husband died
[1:15:50] hallelujah that we begin that we're
[1:15:52] allowed to be united to another and then
[1:15:54] another is Christ hallelujah amen no I'm
[1:16:02] just going to go back to this and if we
[1:16:04] had time or time would permit us rather
[1:16:06] we'd go back and take the birth of those
[1:16:08] patriarchs when they were born by those
[1:16:10] woman and each one when the baby was
[1:16:12] born and the mother and labor added the
[1:16:14] voice of this patriarch positionally
[1:16:16] placed him in his place in Palestine
[1:16:17] hundreds of years later how can we put
[1:16:21] in confidence in this written word of
[1:16:22] God because it's so inspired and every
[1:16:24] phrase of it hangs together and it's
[1:16:26] drawing a picture of us what God was and
[1:16:29] what God is and always will be now we
[1:16:31] find out when Joshua divide the
[1:16:33] inheritance of the people each person
[1:16:35] was placed positionally exactly the way
[1:16:38] these Hebrew mothers name those children
[1:16:40] how they were placed in Palestine just
[1:16:43] at their place ash again net Faline each
[1:16:45] one Judah every one had placed in their
[1:16:47] position what wonderful picture it gets
[1:16:50] us because of the type of God placing in
[1:16:52] the church himself every member every
[1:16:54] stone every place every Christian to
[1:16:57] itself each one of us in our particular
[1:16:59] peculiar way has a place in the house of
[1:17:02] God like Solomon's Temple when it was
[1:17:05] cut out all around the world but when it
[1:17:08] was brought in to Joppa Florida it took
[1:17:10] there by oxcart and these odd rocks had
[1:17:12] their place when the temple went
[1:17:14] together we are being previous led to a
[1:17:18] place
[1:17:19] hallelujah and he says Alba trophy let's
[1:17:25] go back don't mind reading a bit more I
[1:17:29] will betroth thee unto me and
[1:17:31] faithfulness now thou shalt know the
[1:17:34] Lord and it shall come to pass in that
[1:17:36] day I will hear saith the Lord I'll hear
[1:17:38] the heavens know hear the earth and the
[1:17:41] earth shall hear the corn and and the
[1:17:43] wine and the oil they shall hedge Israel
[1:17:45] and I'll sew her unto me in the earth
[1:17:47] there speaking of a woman I'm gonna
[1:17:50] apply the woman in the earth
[1:17:52] Alleluia that's you by the way and them
[1:17:55] in the earth and I will have mercy upon
[1:17:56] her that had not obtained mercy and I'll
[1:18:00] say to them that were not my people thou
[1:18:02] art my people and they shall say thou
[1:18:05] art my god the speaking of a Gentile
[1:18:06] people because because when Hosea was
[1:18:09] not speaking this Israel we were not the
[1:18:11] people of God we were Gentiles not even
[1:18:13] in the economy of God I mean but when
[1:18:16] God before the foundation of the world
[1:18:18] when he looked down and says I'm going
[1:18:20] to have a bride I'm going to have a
[1:18:21] people made in my image I mean he wasn't
[1:18:24] just looking at the Jewish people he was
[1:18:26] looking at you he's looking at Gentile
[1:18:28] people and they and and I'll have mercy
[1:18:32] upon her that had not obtained mercy and
[1:18:35] I'll say to them which were not my
[1:18:37] people without my people and they shall
[1:18:39] say thou art my god hallelujah amen so
[1:18:44] now here we are here we are friends I'll
[1:18:49] give you a position I'll give you this
[1:18:51] valley of Achor as a door of Hope a door
[1:18:55] of expectation this will be part of your
[1:18:57] position hallelujah I mean that whatever
[1:19:00] happened in the past when you came into
[1:19:03] the land that's been done away with I

[1:19:13] you this position saith the Lord that
[1:19:14] you would know that everything's been
[1:19:16] done away with assumes been dealt with
[1:19:18] that you can advise and take the whole
[1:19:20] and
[1:19:21] helu you amen
[1:19:25] glory to God hello there yeah we have

[1:19:39] let your past hold you back if God
[1:19:40] doesn't remember it why should you I
[1:19:42] mean the devil is actually a very bad
[1:19:45] historian I have said in the past he's a
[1:19:46] good historian because it loves to
[1:19:48] remind you of what happened but he only
[1:19:50] takes you to a certain point he never
[1:19:53] takes you to the point where he was cast
[1:19:54] out he never takes you to the point
[1:19:56] where he was defeated he never takes you
[1:19:58] to the point where you stood up and
[1:19:59] faith when your eyes came open I mean
[1:20:02] were you no longer a slave Amy but now
[1:20:04] you are the head and not the tail I mean
[1:20:06] he never takes you to the point where
[1:20:08] you chased him out and then when you
[1:20:10] stood up and took the Word of God amen
[1:20:12] and cast him out of your family
[1:20:14] hallelujah was filled with the Holy
[1:20:15] Ghost he never takes you to that point
[1:20:18] hallelujah see the bad historian I mean
[1:20:22] so friends we no longer slaves he wants
[1:20:27] you to take the fullness of this word I
[1:20:28] mean it's weird not me to just sit back
[1:20:32] and say well this is good enough
[1:20:33] take the whole inheritance I mean we're
[1:20:36] not cool just to take some
[1:20:37] denominational idea if this is how

[1:20:41] should be in terms of well this is my
[1:20:44] walk and this is how God works and this
[1:20:46] is it we get him all worked out that's

[1:21:08] everything's open all these chains
[1:21:11] broken and the Apostles they had to come
[1:21:14] to a point they had to realize you know
[1:21:16] God is more than we even recognize
[1:21:18] Peter Peter the messages of the first
[1:21:21] stage he had God will worked out with in
[1:21:24] a seminary idea and then God came down
[1:21:26] says I'm very different to what you
[1:21:28] think I am and he handed us ritual in he
[1:21:30] had us form I me but then God came and
[1:21:33] revealed himself and he realized I mean
[1:21:35] the God he thought he was a worshipping
[1:21:37] wasn't the God he has been to be
[1:21:38] worshiping
