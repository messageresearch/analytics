bless you all good to have everyone here tonight amen Luke 22 and vers uh 14 we're going to read from here Sor I don't have a slideshow at all um but everyone's everyone's come armed amen and when the hour was come he sat down and the twel apostles with him and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer from I say unto you I will not eat uh I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament of My Blood blood which is shed for you amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight gracious father we want to thank you we can we can bow our heads in your presence one more time we can approach your great presence and say Lord that's all we desire is that you would shine through us that you would live through us oh God that people wouldn't come in contact with us necessarily but they come in contact with you Lord that this Dying World would would see you live once again and Lord you would turn Hearts back to you oh God May grant that father we want to thank you we can come this communion night and remember your death your burial your Resurrection Lord all your the great price you paid for our Redemption and father as we're standing here with many needs on our heart we um especially want to remember Sister Barbara Lord who had a surgery today Lord Jesus she's uh the reporter she's feeling a bit groggy but she's got high blood pressure we just want to ask Lord that you would touch her Lord Jesus thank you she's come through the surgery now we're praying that your healing hand would be upon her father whatever these surgeons now Lord You're the Healer so I pray dear God You' touch her May her blood pressure go back down to normal May the grogginess leave her and I pray she'd be very quickly uh be be be raised up out of that hospital bed for your glory and also we want to remember brother kuin who's own well tonight father I pray you touch him Lord and heal them for your glory Lord we commit them into your hands as well and anyone else who Lord could not make it because of sickness we just want to ask that you would go to where they are father take all symptoms away Lord and may you be glorified in every situation we're so thankful we can commit every everything we come into Lord into your hands and you work it out for what's best for us we love you Lord we thank you bless the reading of your word Lord which you we've just read in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight I just want to you know it's it's it's it's odd uh well I found this odd this is me in my little thinking but where the Lord would say do this in rembrance of me isn't it strange when he was talking to his 12 disciples he was talking to the the apostles that would take the gospel that would go to Pentecost would be filled with the spirit of God they would be they would uh F fulfill the prophecy of Joel of pouring you know God would pour out a spirit out upon All Flesh and the God that was with them would would would then come into them but then the Lord would say do this to remember me isn't that a strange thing really you know you think how could they ever forget if God is in them if God is changed them and God had called them out of many dark places like he has us he's taken us from many different walks of life many different situations and he's and he's brought us out of you know a lot of dark places but just like he did them but then he says do this in remembrance of me I think it's very important we never forget what the Lord has done for us you know not not just the fact that he's done it but the power that's contained in it amen that you know we understand that that what you know by by by his sacrifice that day on Calvary he he didn't just patch us up he didn't just cover our sin amen he took our sins far away as we well we haven't sung it recently but living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away am amen Rising he justified me freely forever one day is coming oh glorious day so there's great power there's tremendous power you think about where we were born lost we were all born lost not one of us were born saved not one of us were born a saint we were all lost we all needed salvation and we were on our way to hell but yet the Lord Jesus and his great love and mercy and compassion amen interrupted the devil's plan amen took over over our lives when we surrendered to him he saved us he called us he found us he saved us he's done an incredible work and he hasn't left us he hasn't left us half done amen he's going to finish the work he started and you know it's incredible when he'd say but but do this in remembrance of me I think if we could keep the the the uttermost focus on what he done I think it would revolutionize Our Lives I think it would keep everything in perspective I think it really would I mean you people you know there's always uh you know in the Med and different things there's always things are are Amplified or or or you know hyperbolized or however you say it you know to to to try and get people's attention and the devil loves to do that with trials and suffering and hardship he loves to make them look bigger than they really are and we know without God in the equation we're without hope but with him you know all things can happen and and you know he can do all things and we understand with him in the equation it's all working together for our good God is working amen he is He is wanting to reveal tell himself there's nothing in life that was is without purpose for a child of God I mean everything is for a purpose and it's for him he wants to work out he wants to work everything for our good amen so I think you know if we just keep really that that that um I wouldn't say even a thought but the reality of it you know the you know this may be quite simple tonight but I think if we could just really think Lord you found me I was lost and you found me amen I needed salvation and you saved me amen I've been sick but you've healed me amen I needed guidance and you guided me I I felt troubled and you comforted me amen you know everything he's done and you know I think if we just can can can keep that on the Forefront of our hearts when we're talking with people amen that should be on our hearts the Lord is my savior he's in control he can he can save anyone amen there's nothing too hard for God Amen things may look like things may look hopeless without him but if you include him amen everything's going to work out just fine you really think about if you've fully surrendered your life to the Lord Jesus Christ you can never have a bad day amen you'll have unexpected days y amen relative to other days you'll have good or bad days but in reality you'll never have a truly bad day because God has ordained your steps amen God knows what you need amen God knows the situations that he he will allow to come into your life for him to prove himself in those situations amen he wants to prove his word in your life amen and how else can he do it but allow the devil to come in and try and try and attack you but but he wants you to see that his salvation is more than enough amen his blood is not just a a little thing amen no it's complete salvation is of the Lord he's done a complete work amen the blood of Jesus Christ is nothing can defeat it amen like brother Ram said about when he saw the vision of the boy in Finland and then he and then when he came to Finland he finally realized that he was stepping into that vision he said you could line every devil up in hell and they couldn't stop that boy coming from from the dead dead to life again amen as the same thing when we realize if we if we could look at like the world is falling apart we're at the end time we understand that but we're walking in the vision of the Resurrection we're walking in the vision of the Rapture we're living in a Rapture season and no devil in hell can stop it that's right amen and he died that our bodies would be changed amen he died that when we stand before him we are perfect we are sinless amen I don't believe one of us you know if you're really under the blood of Jesus Christ on that day there'll be no one who's ashamed hallelujah amen because you see the one who died for you you're standing in front of the one who called you you're standing in front of the one who loved you is you're standing in front of the one who wanted you there you're standing in front of Amen this it's going to be incredible moment amen it's going to be wonderful amen when you really see him amen so shall we love him even the Bible says yet without seeing him we love him see how is that even possible it doesn't make sense but when you really meet the Lord Jesus Christ you fall in love with him and the one you have loved since the day you've surrendered your life is the one you'll stand in front of and he won't say you never knew me he you'll never if you're really under the blood of Jesus Christ you really know him you won't be disappointed that day amen amen you cannot be disappointed that day he'll say Well done my good and faithful servant you may think man I'm a failure I've done nothing good but just to believe his word to take him at his word surrender your whole life to his word and let him live that's good faithful servant amen amen where because remember the drunk servant started to do things he wanted to do right but the faithful servant said no the Master's given me instructions and because I love him I'm going to let it live out of my life we have our bad days we have our good days but he says they're faithful hallelujah hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen so I'm looking forward to that day we're a day closer this world is falling apart well people have been saying that for decades well here we are slow motion train wreck but we're not in a slow motion train wreck no we're on the steps of Ascension going up into Glory but you've got to realize God has made you and I probably want to go into it on Sunday but he's made us Kings and Priests remember the first time communion was ever served was by by mesc to Abraham and Abraham was a king he had Dominion he was a priest he had fellowship with God Amen and he was a prophet the word came to him amen and God has made us all three things the word comes to you cuz you received him didn't you not amen he's made you a spiritual King you got dominion over the devil do you not amen dominion over the flesh dominion over self God gives you that Dominion amen and then he gives you what you're a priest you can enter into the fellowship of God and you can intercede for those who are without just like Abraham did remember you know you know the Angels were going down you know the Lord was going down into Sodom he sent two angels before him and what was Abraham doing standing in the office of a priest interceding for lot if you find 40 righteous will you destroy it and you know you know God keep bring the numbers down why because Abraham was standing as an intercessor amen and lot got called out because of Abraham standing in his position amen and it's the same thing with you and I there's power in the office God has placed you in because of Calvary he's placed you in an office because of his blood he's placed you in an office he's given you Authority amen so you must never ever diminish what God has made you you say am I worthy well he called you to the office so you're worthy amen he's made you worthy he's made you able amen so I think it's very uh tremendous that we can stand here this night and say thank you for your blood Lord because the power of your blood I have fellowship with you now God there's not some big golf there not some theology to try and you know know you but you you've revealed yourself to me you've changed my life you've cleansed me I'm sure if we had time we could all stand here and say something that was a besetting thing is now gone what is that the power of the blood amen before you a skeptic didn't even believe but now you're believer what is that the power of the blood amen there's a time when you took your life into your own hands but now you let him take get over what's that the power of the blood amen so so I'm sure we can all boast in the blood of Jesus Christ tonight but we should never ever let it become common amen I think that's one thing if we could have some themes in this you know as a body of Believers we cherish the blood what God has done for us the power of the Cross amen because it's not just something we glorify in and see no results no we see the power of it that's why we glorify in it right so we don't just get caught up with a historical fact no we're rejoicing in the benefits of it amen I'm a living beneficiary of Jesus going to Calvary amen I'm a living beneficiary of him going to hell in my place carrying my sins far away I'm a living beneficiary of him raising again amen and I'm sure we can all say yes we are living beneficiaries of it amen so I think that's why to me that's why you know the Lord said do this in remembrance of me of what I that the greatest week brother R said was the death bar resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ the greatest week in history there's been some great weeks but that was the greatest week sir amen so let's just um let's just uh turn to uh 1 Corinthians um 11 and um brother Ed if you could bring the bring the um the bread and the wine up cuz you know I I probably say this every communion but I feel the same way every communion I'm so thankfully found me but I don't take it for granted I'm not afraid I'm going to lose my salvation that's done you say if you're if you're sealed in you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but I don't take it for granted I don't say oh yeah that's just some common thing yeah sure e e this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often e
