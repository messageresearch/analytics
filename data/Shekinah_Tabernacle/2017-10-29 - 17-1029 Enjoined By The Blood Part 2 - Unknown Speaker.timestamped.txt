[23:15] amen
[23:17] do we have testimonies yes that IV and
[23:37] everyone went to like wolves and when we
[23:42] finished we wanted to take the key out
[23:45] and the key was not in the bag so then
[23:49] we had to go around the golf course
[23:52] looking for the key and he went to one
[23:56] side and I went to the other side and
[23:58] while I was walking I was praying and he
[24:01] was doing the same thing and I say to
[24:04] the Lord
[24:04] okay now I'm doing this praying and I
[24:06] know everyone's doing the same thing and
[24:08] he's praying for the key and I'm prank
[24:10] would be given bearing different sides
[24:12] and I just went through from the one
[24:17] call to the next and I was walking
[24:21] towards the one and I say to the road
[24:23] hang on I've got the spoken word I have
[24:28] it so in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:31] Christ I claim the key at hole number 16
[24:34] in your name and for your glory when I
[24:37] got there the key was the painting to
[24:40] the ground anyone else
[24:51] I just my side of the story so I took
[24:55] the back nine which is the more
[24:57] difficult one because there was sheep
[24:59] around and Magpies and sheep dung and
[25:03] I've got a black key that looks like
[25:05] sheep dung so it was difficult for me to
[25:08] find the key but my lesson out of that
[25:10] and I'm very glad Lonnie got the key I
[25:13] was walking anything and thought if I
[25:16] see the key at T number five and it's
[25:20] there and it's shining I know the keys
[25:23] there but I'm still here and there's no
[25:26] way I can just time travel all of a
[25:28] sudden I'm at the key I still need to
[25:30] walk I still need to get there so I can
[25:33] see where I'm going I can see that's my
[25:36] that's my goal that's what I want this
[25:39] is what I'm living for for this moment
[25:41] but I still need to walk there so
[25:44] through the sheep dung and the sheep in
[25:45] the Lambs I need to get there but I know
[25:48] that that is it that's it period in a me
[25:54] [Applause]
[26:01] all right I thought I'd better share
[26:03] this because I gave you part one of the
[26:05] trial and the testimony so I gave you
[26:08] part one but I give you better give you
[26:09] part two remember when I shared how the
[26:13] Lord showed me how I put a wall up and
[26:14] then I didn't let my husband in and I
[26:16] let him in and it's changed our marriage
[26:18] it has a revolutionize our marriage but
[26:20] there was something I did which made the
[26:23] trial prolong oh it was good but it uh
[26:27] so when I let Isaac in he was in my
[26:30] heart and and I yeah he I think I
[26:35] replaced him with Christ because Christ
[26:37] came into my heart first right and I've
[26:39] never let a person come into my heart
[26:41] then he came into my heart and then he
[26:42] became exalted in my heart first place
[26:46] and that's where the trouble started
[26:48] begin
[26:49] I started getting um I started expecting
[26:51] him to give me the love of Christ at
[26:53] Ikes that only Christ can give you and
[26:55] um and so when he wasn't giving me that
[26:59] you know when you get into your prayer
[27:00] closet and you just feel so special in
[27:03] the Lord Oh
[27:04] you know and he just there's just
[27:06] something that Christ that human beings
[27:08] cannot do and so then so when he wasn't
[27:12] giving me that that love like only
[27:14] Christ can I was getting a bit snippy a
[27:16] Isaac it was becoming like quite regular
[27:18] whoo it was awful and it was actually
[27:21] even getting like every three days and
[27:23] then I was like I was like sniffy and it
[27:25] was yeah Isaac can testify was really
[27:26] bad but um and then so I had enough it
[27:30] happened over a few months a like it was
[27:32] just getting worse and worse and so I
[27:34] just came to the Lord and I said oh I
[27:36] don't know what's going on you know can
[27:37] you help me and you just get down on
[27:39] your knees and then the and then the
[27:41] Lord really showed me oh there was lots
[27:45] of things ah ha ha ha um Wednesday night
[27:47] brother Ben preached about all these
[27:49] things and I thought because I was on my
[27:51] knees praying praying praying and I
[27:52] thought he was going to point the finger
[27:53] at other other you know other people and
[27:56] that was that I was I was right you know
[27:59] there was nothing wrong with me but then
[28:02] he spoke the word and man he just
[28:04] pinpointed four points and the Lord just
[28:07] shone his light boom this is this is
[28:09] what's in you and then I just I've
[28:13] always been afraid of the Lord rebuking
[28:14] me and showing me things in me because I
[28:16] I don't like to disappoint him but then
[28:18] after that I was like Oh Lord forgive me
[28:20] you know I don't want those things and
[28:22] I'm always so good because look Satan
[28:25] tried to condemn me and say oh no you
[28:27] now you're not filled with the Holy
[28:28] Ghost and everything else but then I got
[28:30] a phone call the next day from a sister
[28:31] who prayed for me and then saw you know
[28:33] saw the Lord with me and it was amazing
[28:34] and then after that I realized I did not
[28:38] put Christ in his rightful place in my
[28:40] heart there's room for lots of people
[28:43] you know room for my husband and there
[28:46] but he remains first place he remains
[28:49] king and the only place he wants in he's
[28:52] a jealous God is king supreme and so Oh
[28:56] once I put him in his rightful place my
[29:00] marriage has just like I thought it
[29:02] revolutionized but man it just gets
[29:04] better and better and bitter because now
[29:06] I've got Christ as my king in my
[29:08] husband's in my heart and all yeah so
[29:10] that's that's part two and I don't think
[29:12] that well I mean there might be other
[29:14] parts but that was that was - that part
[29:16] praise the Lord
[29:18] [Music]

[48:05] Thanksgiving dinner or evening afternoon
[48:08] on the last week last Saturday of
[48:11] November so I think it's the 25th of
[48:13] November 26 and Movember so if you

[48:17] invitations on the front desk is
[48:18] everyone's invited we're gonna have a
[48:19] wonderful time I mean we've got a lot to
[48:22] be thankful for now sees here in Isaiah
[48:26] 26 and 3 it says it says if thou will
[48:30] keep Herman so thou will keep him in
[48:33] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[48:35] thee because he trusts us in thee I mean
[48:41] so this is if your mind has stayed on
[48:43] the Lord he will keep you in perfect
[48:44] peace right because he trusts us in thee
[48:47] and then we're going to Hebrews chapter
[48:49] 9 and verse we're gonna read down a bit
[48:53] of a portion of Scripture here in
[48:55] Hebrews chapter 9 and you may think
[48:57] these are two very different kind of
[48:59] scriptures but I want to continue on
[49:02] from Wednesday if I may seize here now
[49:06] so Hebrews 9 and 13 it says for if the
[49:13] blood of bulls and of goats and the
[49:16] ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean
[49:18] sanctify earth to pure fly purifying of
[49:21] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[49:23] of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit
[49:26] offered himself without spot to God
[49:28] purge your conscience from dead works to
[49:31] serve the Living God well your next one
[49:35] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[49:38] the New Testament that by means of his
[49:41] death thereby means was death for the
[49:45] redemption of the transgressions that
[49:46] were under the first Testament they
[49:49] which are called might receive the
[49:50] promise of it of eternal inheritance
[49:56] for where a testament is there must also
[49:58] be necessary necessity be the death of
[50:01] the testator for a testament as as a
[50:05] force after men are dead otherwise that
[50:07] have it is of no strength at all while
[50:10] the testator liveth whereupon neither
[50:14] the first testament was dedicated
[50:16] without blood for when Moses had spoken
[50:19] every precept to all the people
[50:21] according to the law he took the blood
[50:23] of calves and of goats with the water
[50:25] and scarlet wool and hyssop and
[50:28] sprinkled both the book and all the
[50:31] people saying this is the blood of the
[50:34] Testament which God hath enjoined unto
[50:37] you Amy may the Lord bless his word you
[50:39] may have your seats this morning so I
[50:45] want to continue just a thought about
[50:49] how the blood hasn't joined us to the
[50:51] promise we see here and we see here in
[50:55] Hebrews chapter 9 that Moses after he
[51:00] after he gave the word that he received
[51:02] on mount sinai to the people that he
[51:04] sprinkles the the book the law and he
[51:07] sprinkles the people with the same blood
[51:09] joining the law to the people and as I
[51:12] said on Wednesday just a quick review
[51:14] the law actually had power in it it
[51:16] wasn't just to you know if the people
[51:19] kept the law now we understand the law
[51:21] was a policeman that just put the people
[51:23] in jail but Jesus Christ sets us free
[51:25] but also there was a power in that law
[51:28] because there was a promise in the law
[51:30] one will chase a thousand two will chase
[51:32] ten thousand that there was a power in
[51:34] the law that the people could dwell in
[51:36] their land drive out the enemies and
[51:38] have peace with God walking among them
[51:40] that was really the real purpose of the
[51:42] law that God would place his people in
[51:44] their inheritance and God would be among
[51:46] them even though I was under the blood
[51:47] of bulls and goats even though God could
[51:49] not dwell in his people he couldn't
[51:51] change the hydrous people but that was
[51:53] there was a power in the law and that's
[51:55] just under the blood of bulls and goats
[51:56] I mean so Shamgar under the blood of
[51:59] bulls and goats killed what six to eight
[52:01] hundred eight hundred Philistines
[52:03] because he was under the blood of bulls
[52:04] and goats but the Prophet says he knew
[52:06] he was a son of
[52:07] Abraham and that was enough I mean so he
[52:10] knew he was standing in his inheritance
[52:11] he was a son of Abraham he was
[52:14] circumcised to the promise he was out of
[52:16] the blood of bulls and goats and that
[52:17] was enough
[52:18] and he took us on ox cart and he killed
[52:20] however many hundred of the enemy
[52:22] soldiers because there was power on the
[52:24] law I mean so there's so the promise now
[52:28] we are not living under the law if we're
[52:30] dead we're free from the law if we
[52:32] really did in Christ we are free from
[52:34] the law so we're not under that but it
[52:36] goes to show now that affects just under
[52:39] the blood of animals how much more the
[52:41] power that is and that is in the
[52:44] Covenant under the blood of God's own
[52:45] son Jesus Christ hallelujah so now God
[52:49] wants to do something for us I'll be
[52:51] thinking a lot about sonship now we're
[52:55] gonna read a few things but there was
[52:57] power in the law you understand under
[52:58] the blood of bulls and goats David took
[53:00] the whole land under the blood of bulls
[53:02] and goats no man could stand before
[53:03] Samuel all the days of his life you got
[53:06] to read the Old Testament characters
[53:07] Gideon under the blood of bulls and
[53:09] goats you know with 300 men defeated the
[53:12] people of the east and the Midianites
[53:13] and all those people under the blood of
[53:15] bulls and goats under the blood of bulls
[53:17] and goats Moses brought the children of
[53:19] Israel out of Egypt into the Promised
[53:21] Land and this is under the blood of
[53:23] natural animals and he had a creative
[53:25] power he could speak amen hallelujah
[53:29] let there be flood frogs or flies or
[53:31] whatever and and they they appeared amen
[53:35] now how much more now that was a son
[53:38] under the blood of bulls and goats how
[53:40] much more a son or daughter of God
[53:41] that's under the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:43] ending in their position I mean there's
[53:46] nothing they can stand before the Bride
[53:47] of Christ there's nothing that can stand
[53:50] before you you got to understand this no
[53:52] weapon because of what he has made you
[53:54] to be no weapon that is formed against
[53:56] you shall prosper they means that he
[53:59] joined so now we ever promised you know
[54:02] we're singing that song that was it
[54:04] Declan wrote yo will sing of us peace
[54:06] sing of us great love and it season in
[54:09] revelations chapter 5 when the lamb
[54:12] takes the book they sang in you song I
[54:14] mean so to me oh that's just me when I
[54:17] hear that song will sing I mean I'll
[54:19] sing my new song
[54:20] because by his blooder birrabeen redeem
[54:23] back to god and he's taking my
[54:24] inheritance
[54:25] he's looser seals off it and now he says
[54:28] this is what belongs to you this is what
[54:30] belongs to you I'm going to make sure
[54:32] you receive it I mean because we read
[54:34] about the death of a you know for a
[54:37] testament there's no force after men are
[54:39] dead otherwise there's no strength at
[54:40] all while the testator liveth so that
[54:42] the person who gives the inheritance
[54:44] normally has to die first for them for
[54:47] the people to receive it but then Jesus
[54:49] didn't just die to give us the
[54:50] inheritance but he's a life forever more
[54:53] to make sure you receive yer inheritance
[54:55] amen and our inheritance is our position
[54:57] in Christ I mean that there would be a
[54:59] people upon the earth that would come to
[55:01] their placing in the body they would
[55:03] come to their sonship now when it speaks
[55:06] about sons of God it also speaks about
[55:08] daughters of God it's a position in
[55:10] Christ I mean so just because it doesn't
[55:12] say daughters doesn't mean it's only men
[55:14] there no it's not that way it's a now
[55:17] our Lord Jesus is here in this hour that
[55:21] we would come to our adoption we would
[55:24] come to our placing hallelujah this is
[55:27] this is why the book came open that's
[55:29] why the seals were open that's why the
[55:32] lamb stepped forth I'm going to make
[55:34] sure my children come to their place
[55:35] that they no longer downtrodden and
[55:38] tossed to and fro and you know bound by
[55:40] bound by personality you know I was
[55:42] praying very much last night Lord Mayor
[55:45] may I walk with you not be biased by our
[55:48] upbringing or by our culture or by our
[55:51] personality because brother Brown says
[55:53] brother Graham says that that someone is
[55:56] very scholarly if they don't keep it
[55:57] under prayer they'll become dogmatic and
[55:59] starchy and those who are very emotional
[56:02] people of the don't keep it under prayer
[56:03] dug off you're into wild things he
[56:06] doesn't use the word while things with
[56:07] usual counsel Bobby says that our
[56:09] personalities if we don't keep it unto
[56:11] prayer will make us go certain ways I'm
[56:14] like Lord I don't want my walk with you
[56:17] to be dictated to by this thing I want
[56:22] to be dictated to by the Holy Ghost and
[56:24] only the Holy Ghost because my culture
[56:26] will make me lean a certain way my upper
[56:28] who make me lean a certain way and do
[56:30] certain things and look at life a
[56:31] certain way
[56:32] but who says it's right who says it's
[56:35] right so we got a lay aside lay aside
[56:38] our upbringing meaning things are good
[56:40] in our upbringing but it's the bad
[56:41] things we're gonna say Lord Lord you go
[56:44] through and take out everything that's
[56:46] not of you and that's her and as same
[56:49] with our personality because you've got
[56:51] a maybe your biggest enemy as yourself
[56:52] and the devil will take your carnal
[56:55] nature and your whisper in your ear and
[56:57] all sound so good and you're going off
[56:59] on some tantrum someplace at all because
[57:02] you're actually being led by your carnal
[57:03] nature yet you could have quotes and
[57:05] scriptures to back up your position I
[57:07] mean but who says it's right so we're
[57:10] gonna be very careful I you know Lord I
[57:14] want to walk with you according to what
[57:16] you want I don't want my bias my by
[57:20] human bias is always wrong mine is very
[57:22] wrong I'll be the first one to admit
[57:26] that one now he sees in John one and one
[57:31] he sees in the beginning was the word
[57:33] and the Word was with God and the Word
[57:36] was God the same was in the beginning
[57:39] with God all things were made by him and
[57:42] without him was not anything made that
[57:44] was made in him was life and the life
[57:46] was the light of men and it would just
[57:51] drop down to verse 11 he says he came
[57:53] unto his own and his own received him
[57:56] not but as many as received him whose
[57:59] received him in this day whose received
[58:01] our Lord Jesus is up as as Lord and
[58:04] personal Savior
[58:05] so not just Savior but Lord Lord means
[58:08] your king as many as received him to
[58:12] them gave he power to become the sons of
[58:15] God member those daughters as well
[58:16] that's just not sons right I mean that's
[58:19] a position even to them that believe on
[58:22] his name I love that song name above all
[58:25] names here is the name above all names I
[58:28] mean not the name of some denomination
[58:31] or some church or the name above all
[58:33] names of the name of Jesus Christ amen
[58:35] in this power in that name this life in
[58:38] that name is redemption in that name
[58:40] this healing in that name there's
[58:41] identity in that name everything you
[58:44] meet overs in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:45] he is wonderful
[58:47] he's the mighty God the everlasting
[58:49] father the Prince of Peace amen if he
[58:52] has a feast the Prince of Peace he'll
[58:54] give us subjects peace
[58:56] hallelujah he'll give us bride peace my
[58:59] peace I give you notice the world gifts
[59:01] but you got to keep your mind state on
[59:03] him because we're on a journey remember
[59:05] our journey from a slave to the throne I
[59:08] mean we're a journey from a slave being
[59:10] beaten by the devil until finally we are
[59:13] joint heirs with Christ
[59:15] I made it remember those who came out of
[59:17] Egypt under the blood they were God
[59:20] wanted to place them in the land but
[59:22] everything they need of was in that lamb
[59:24] and that blood that token blood they
[59:26] walked out of everything Nieto was there
[59:29] hallelujah those had to walk and receive
[59:31] it a mentor one day one day one day no
[59:35] the scripture says will come to it now
[59:36] we are the sons of God today amen which
[59:41] are born not of blood nor of the will of
[59:45] the flesh wasn't your will I just you
[59:48] know I love it how God is sovereign he
[59:51] chooses who he will he raises up who he
[59:54] will he reveals himself to he will he
[59:56] hardeneth who he will you know he's
[59:58] sovereign and to me that takes any any
[1:00:02] of my ability out of the equation
[1:00:04] completely because it was God's
[1:00:06] sovereign choosing I choose this one I
[1:00:08] can reveal myself to this way this one's
[1:00:10] going to know me I'm going to declare my
[1:00:12] name to that person and they will meet
[1:00:14] me and I'll be their God and they leave
[1:00:16] our child I mean that is God that is
[1:00:19] God's sovereign choosing and to me I'm
[1:00:22] so thankful every day you chose me don't
[1:00:26] need to become Commodore but I do this
[1:00:27] and this with us no he chose me and in
[1:00:30] my life is a reflection of that
[1:00:32] Thanksgiving they should be more a means
[1:00:36] to that don't just go quiet on me aren't
[1:00:39] you thankful nor of the will of man but
[1:00:44] of God and God's will is supreme
[1:00:47] nothing can stop his will
[1:00:50] c'mon hundred he can try and stop it but
[1:00:53] at the end of the day the Israelites
[1:00:55] possessed the whole land the devil's
[1:00:57] world was I'm going to stop them
[1:00:59] and he said Balaam and he did all kinds
[1:01:01] of things that he and he fortify and he
[1:01:03] anointed the people in the cities you
[1:01:05] know Jericho you know why were the
[1:01:08] fortification so strong because here's
[1:01:10] God speaking to a son Abraham your seed
[1:01:12] is going to sojourn in a strange land
[1:01:14] for hundred years they're going to be
[1:01:16] afflicted but I'm going to bring them
[1:01:17] back to this place under a mighty hand
[1:01:19] the devil's taking notes this is what
[1:01:21] his promise is gonna be I'm gonna stop
[1:01:23] this promise so he fortified the cities
[1:01:25] you know he inspired the people to train
[1:01:28] their warriors and do all kinds of
[1:01:29] things did it stop them no it didn't
[1:01:32] stop then stop God's promise then stop
[1:01:35] God's will God's will is you're gonna be
[1:01:37] in the land and they're in the land and
[1:01:39] God's will for us is you're going to
[1:01:40] receive your inheritance I mean
[1:01:43] everything God has for you will receive
[1:01:44] you're just going to say be it unto me
[1:01:46] according to thy word that should be our
[1:01:49] response for everything be it unto me
[1:01:51] according to thy word hallelujah you get
[1:01:54] a go to rapture be it unto me according
[1:01:56] to thy word I've sent you the shout the
[1:01:58] message of the shop be it unto me
[1:02:00] according to thy word amen
[1:02:02] you'll be the head and not the tail be
[1:02:04] it unto me according to thy word I mean
[1:02:06] you're more than a conqueror through him
[1:02:07] that loved you be it unto me according
[1:02:09] to thy word
[1:02:09] wing goes through many things of those
[1:02:11] things hallelujah but you've got to say
[1:02:13] Lord be it unto thee according to thy
[1:02:14] word because that's that's your promise
[1:02:17] I mean the Bible is not a storybook
[1:02:21] that's a it's a it's a covenant with you
[1:02:24] Laurie but we see Jesus no but we see
[1:02:29] Jesus who's made a little lower than the
[1:02:31] Angels God became a man for the
[1:02:34] suffering of death crowned with glory
[1:02:35] and honor that he by the grace of God
[1:02:38] should taste death for every man he took
[1:02:41] my place he took my place been but now
[1:02:44] if he is the supreme one he's the
[1:02:47] supreme one he is the head of the church
[1:02:49] he's the head of the body he is the
[1:02:51] husband he's the king he's the sacrifice
[1:02:54] he's the Lamb
[1:02:55] he's our all and all so if he's how old
[1:02:57] and old who should our eyes be upon your
[1:03:00] pulse is looking unto Jesus
[1:03:03] not looking under yourself with your
[1:03:05] brother - your sister or whatever more
[1:03:06] looking unto Jesus I'm not interested in
[1:03:09] what other people do now don't put me
[1:03:11] wrong we should pray for one another
[1:03:12] love one another but ultimately I'm not
[1:03:14] worried about what other people doing
[1:03:15] I'm looking at him because what you look
[1:03:18] at you will become you what you look at
[1:03:21] you will become if you look at each
[1:03:23] other you'll become like each other but
[1:03:25] if you look at him you'll become him so
[1:03:28] who are you looking at who are you
[1:03:31] looking at we're not mean to be a bunch
[1:03:33] of peacocks strutting around thinking
[1:03:35] we're the bee's knees who are you
[1:03:37] looking at I didn't say that as a joke
[1:03:39] but you got to think about it I'm
[1:03:41] looking under Jesus I'm looking under
[1:03:43] him against his word for became him for
[1:03:49] whom are all things and by whom are all
[1:03:52] things and bringing many sons unto glory
[1:03:55] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:03:57] perfect through sufferings they say that
[1:04:02] this is his purpose and bringing many
[1:04:05] sons unto glory so here's a call that's
[1:04:08] gone out yeah that's why God and I've
[1:04:12] been thinking about this we think about
[1:04:15] seals we think about horse riders
[1:04:17] sometimes we think about tribulation the
[1:04:19] lamb opening the book is more than those
[1:04:21] things the lamb opening the book is now
[1:04:23] saying I'm gonna bring you unto glory
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] I'm gonna I'm gonna bring you to your
[1:04:30] position because remember a lot of what
[1:04:32] Paul was saying in the first age was
[1:04:34] prophecy they did not fully possess the
[1:04:37] promise in their day they didn't fully
[1:04:39] you see the Ephesians the Ephesian you
[1:04:42] know the word Ephesians means aimed at
[1:04:44] but relaxed so they aimed at the high
[1:04:47] call in Christ but because the anointing
[1:04:49] of the aged they relaxed because they
[1:04:51] had to because the church had to go
[1:04:52] eventually down into the Dark Ages and
[1:04:54] die right and go underground
[1:04:56] so they aimed at it but then they
[1:04:58] relaxed so what many things Paul is
[1:05:00] saying is prophecy of this day amen
[1:05:03] because this book is a book of prophecy
[1:05:05] all the scripture actually in the Bible
[1:05:08] pertains to today amen it's not all it's
[1:05:11] not just history I mean so now he's
[1:05:15] saying now
[1:05:16] that there will be a people because
[1:05:18] remember when we come to our position
[1:05:20] then the rapture will go when the bride
[1:05:24] around the world comes to her position
[1:05:26] then the rapture will go I mean because
[1:05:28] God ever there was a man and a woman and
[1:05:32] a garden in the beginning husband and
[1:05:35] wife and the garden in the beginning and
[1:05:36] through the Old Testament God was
[1:05:39] molding and shaping rebuilding the man
[1:05:41] then here was Jesus Christ the fullness
[1:05:43] of God here Bodley in flesh here's the
[1:05:45] man the second Adam and he demonstrated
[1:05:47] everything that the first Adam did I
[1:05:49] mean before the fall he had power over
[1:05:52] nature you know we were having
[1:05:55] fellowship a brother ed Zod was at
[1:05:57] Monday talking about nature and I was
[1:06:00] thinking this should know there's a fear
[1:06:04] between us and us in nature you know it
[1:06:07] doesn't matter what what creature maybe
[1:06:09] is a fear but it's not meant to be that
[1:06:11] way we mean to be Adams fallen races
[1:06:16] meet to be the gods of the earth and I
[1:06:19] mean to be our subjects now in Eden
[1:06:23] everything was was controlled by divine
[1:06:26] love there's no fear there's no
[1:06:29] separation between between man and beast
[1:06:31] in terms of you could call whatever
[1:06:34] animal they be no fear the biggest lion
[1:06:36] the biggest whatever was there the
[1:06:37] biggest scariest whatever you know you
[1:06:41] could just call it come here would come
[1:06:42] brother man talks about cheetah the lion
[1:06:44] I mean cheetah the lion and whatever and
[1:06:46] the tiger and the you know come here and
[1:06:49] they scratch him under the chin and they
[1:06:50] you know there's no fear it's not meant
[1:06:53] to be but now this fear between us and
[1:06:55] beasts it's not meant to be that way
[1:06:57] there's a gulf now there's a gulf of
[1:07:01] fear and his brother Bear I was thinking
[1:07:04] about this last night he's standing in
[1:07:07] Colorado and a blizzard comes through
[1:07:10] and he's about any tells him run because
[1:07:12] it's forecast to happen he tells
[1:07:14] everyone he says now as soon as the
[1:07:16] first snowflakes begin to fall you head
[1:07:18] back back back to base as fast as you
[1:07:21] can because it'll be a blizzard you
[1:07:22] won't be able to see so begins that come
[1:07:24] through it's just white and then he's
[1:07:26] walking back towards can be hears a
[1:07:28] voice behind him you know I am
[1:07:30] I am yo lo God Almighty whatever he says
[1:07:33] will you come and walk with me
[1:07:35] hey sis Lord is at uni turns round he
[1:07:37] walks back into the storm to walk with
[1:07:40] God and then and then the Lord says just
[1:07:42] speak who knows the story you know the
[1:07:44] story he says speak and whatever you say
[1:07:47] will be he says storm you go back we'll
[1:07:50] have three or four days of perfect
[1:07:51] weather we're going to finish the hunt
[1:07:52] and it was a whiteout blizzard in a few
[1:07:54] moments it was just perfect blue sky and
[1:07:56] then now out of the bush has come some
[1:07:58] deer and they come up to him now to me
[1:08:02] know what is this I was thinking last
[1:08:05] night I singing I don't know if animals
[1:08:07] do but do they have a memory because
[1:08:10] things that happen to our forebears
[1:08:12] affect us then they know things that
[1:08:15] happen to them affect us somehow it's
[1:08:17] passed down singing to animals now this
[1:08:19] is just all the fellowship this is just
[1:08:21] me so you can just forget this button
[1:08:23] remember a next part later on but I was
[1:08:25] singing do this nature have a memory of
[1:08:27] what it was like to be governed by Adam
[1:08:29] does it have a memory see come these
[1:08:32] deer up he could have shot them and with
[1:08:34] a visually saying Adam is that you
[1:08:35] because the reader of the scripture all
[1:08:37] of creation is groaning into the
[1:08:40] manifestation sons of God so did they
[1:08:42] come out of those bushes saying is that
[1:08:44] you is that our king that we've been
[1:08:47] waiting all of nature's groaning and
[1:08:50] it's waiting for the manifestation or
[1:08:52] the revealing of the sons of God
[1:08:54] hallelujah that's why they came out
[1:08:57] because here was here was a redeemed son
[1:08:59] in his position and he had control over
[1:09:02] nature and that's what nature's waiting
[1:09:05] for waiting for you to come to its
[1:09:07] position you to come to your position so
[1:09:10] he would bring many sons unto glory he
[1:09:12] had take us I'm so glad he took us and
[1:09:15] you glad he found you and wherever you
[1:09:17] were doesn't matter if you're raised in
[1:09:19] church raised whatever he's got to
[1:09:21] become real to you you've got to
[1:09:23] recognize you jesus paid it all in all
[1:09:25] to him I owe
[1:09:26] hallelujah doesn't matter what other
[1:09:28] what what do you what else makes of it
[1:09:30] amen oh I'll cherish the old rugged
[1:09:33] cross
[1:09:35] hallelujah now so he that sanctifies a
[1:09:39] neighbor who has sanctified all of one
[1:09:41] for which cause he's not ashamed to call
[1:09:43] them brethren saying I'll declare thy
[1:09:45] name unto my brethren the mister Church
[1:09:47] will I sing praise unto thee he's not
[1:09:52] ashamed to call you part of the family
[1:09:53] and again I'll put my trust in him and
[1:09:56] again behold I am the children with God
[1:09:58] has given me for as much seen as the
[1:10:00] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:10:02] blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:10:04] of the same that through death he might
[1:10:06] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:10:08] that is the devil and deliver them who
[1:10:11] through fear of death were all their
[1:10:12] lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah
[1:10:16] it is a deliverance amen where that's
[1:10:19] why people get religious they get scared
[1:10:21] what happens when you die
[1:10:22] and they you know I was talking to a
[1:10:26] brother last weekend and his his his
[1:10:29] father he wasn't a believer but his
[1:10:33] father had a had a Bible in a Koran that
[1:10:35] he read every night because you want to
[1:10:38] make sure if one's wrong then you'll
[1:10:39] then you'll get the right one and if
[1:10:41] one's right you know the other one's
[1:10:42] wrong he want to cover both bases now
[1:10:44] that's sad sad way to be we don't have
[1:10:47] to be that way but people people pick up
[1:10:50] all kinds of different religion because
[1:10:51] they're afraid what's going to happen
[1:10:54] when my threescore and ten are done but
[1:10:57] Jesus came to deliver us from that fear
[1:11:00] we shouldn't have a fear of death if it
[1:11:03] ends now glory death is just brother Ron
[1:11:07] Spencer said death is just a travel bus
[1:11:09] to get us to where we really want to go
[1:11:11] I don't want to stay in this place do
[1:11:14] you want to stay in this place
[1:11:16] hallelujah so this is what Jesus God
[1:11:20] became a man to redeem us back to
[1:11:22] himself because only he could do it now
[1:11:26] let's go to Romans chapter eight there's
[1:11:29] going to be a better reading of them all
[1:11:31] then we'll go from there
[1:11:36] all nature is waiting this is our
[1:11:40] promise you know that it is full
[1:11:55] it says now for ye have not received the
[1:12:00] spirit of bondage again to fear a man
[1:12:04] you should say yes that's me we don't we
[1:12:07] shouldn't be living in fear is this do I
[1:12:10] please him do I not please them it
[1:12:11] should be Lord I love you my life is
[1:12:13] motivated by divine love amen
[1:12:18] my life is the way I love everything I
[1:12:21] do is out of love it's not out of
[1:12:23] anything else it's Lord I love thee I
[1:12:26] will serve thee because I love thee yes
[1:12:30] amen but ye have received the spirit of
[1:12:34] adoption man member adoption in the and
[1:12:37] the Bible is not as a placing of a child
[1:12:40] in the family that their name on the
[1:12:43] check is as good as the father's name
[1:12:44] right so you have received the spirit of
[1:12:47] adoption where you cry Abba Father all
[1:12:49] my father my father amen do you know
[1:12:52] that he do you know that you came from
[1:12:54] him I mean do you know who your father
[1:12:56] really is maybe that's why when God when
[1:12:58] he placed man upon the earth and the
[1:13:00] book of Genesis when man begins to come
[1:13:02] into the picture says and the Lord God
[1:13:04] said and this that's the almighty one
[1:13:07] who who reveals himself whereas
[1:13:09] relationship hallelujah and that's why
[1:13:12] and that's God's whole purpose that's
[1:13:14] why he puts you upon the earth as I'm
[1:13:16] going to declare myself to my children I
[1:13:18] mean I'm going to make myself known to
[1:13:20] them I'm going to walk with them I'm
[1:13:22] going to have a relationship with them
[1:13:23] I'm going to bring them into a position
[1:13:25] helllooo that their joint is with me
[1:13:28] hallelujah I'm glad it's that way I mean
[1:13:32] don't fall asleep on me people I mean
[1:13:34] it's glorious this is part of the
[1:13:36] promise of this age I mean it's why the
[1:13:37] seventh seal came up and the seals are
[1:13:40] open and then the mighty angel descended
[1:13:42] I mean cuz he was an open book because
[1:13:44] he wants you to be placed in your
[1:13:45] position as a son I mean that's why it
[1:13:48] is it's not a doctrine or just a mental
[1:13:50] understanding I mean the Spirit of God
[1:13:52] moved Peleliu just like in Genesis when
[1:13:55] the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:13:56] the waters
[1:13:57] darkness cover the deep and there was a
[1:13:59] separation of darkness and light I mean
[1:14:01] the land came forth because the seats
[1:14:03] were their holiness seed there and he
[1:14:05] says let there be light and the light
[1:14:07] appeared
[1:14:08] I mean let the seed bring forth after
[1:14:10] its kind hallelujah saw the oak tree
[1:14:12] grew into an oak tree I mean the pumpkin
[1:14:15] grew into a pumpkin that then Elan
[1:14:17] became a dandelion the Kari became a
[1:14:19] Kari
[1:14:20] boohoo the cow became it for her to
[1:14:22] cower whatever tree what a puddle or
[1:14:24] vegetation it came forth hallelujah to
[1:14:28] their position what they meant to be and
[1:14:30] is the same thing with you and I oh my I
[1:14:33] love the Spirit of God because what he
[1:14:35] does is he is he broods over us because
[1:14:37] he wants to bring out what's really the
[1:14:39] real you he wants to bring out what you
[1:14:41] really mean to me that's like David he's
[1:14:43] a little shepherd boy you know he's
[1:14:45] looking after his father's sheep guys
[1:14:47] training him to even there and then and
[1:14:49] then the prophet Samuel comes to his
[1:14:52] father's house because God's told him
[1:14:54] there's a king I have a king and Jesse's
[1:14:56] house David's just Davis just you know
[1:15:00] gets up in the morning his dad says now
[1:15:02] take the Sheep go to this back paddock
[1:15:04] or do whatever
[1:15:05] yes dad he just goes off he comes back
[1:15:07] he's a little boy you know he plays like
[1:15:10] a little boy he thinks like a little boy
[1:15:12] you know he's just a normal child but
[1:15:15] Entenmann's to be a king I mean not but
[1:15:18] not out of his ambition it's not our
[1:15:21] ambition I mean it's not out of his he
[1:15:24] doesn't dream of all one day I'll live
[1:15:25] there and well you know I'm going to
[1:15:27] retake Jerusalem I'm gonna make it my
[1:15:28] capital I'm gonna be the king and you
[1:15:30] know God is going to say I'm a man after
[1:15:32] my own you know I'm a man after his own
[1:15:34] heart and this is he's not having these
[1:15:36] kind of ideas being a shepherd boy but
[1:15:38] animus to is to be a king and then a
[1:15:41] vindicated prophet comes comes to his
[1:15:43] father's house takes the Horn of the
[1:15:46] anointing oil pours it out upon the upon
[1:15:49] the vessel pulls out upon God's King
[1:15:52] hallelujah and it says from that day the
[1:15:55] Spirit of God was with him from that day
[1:15:57] on amen and then so it goes from that
[1:16:00] place maybe God's now leading him
[1:16:02] leading from being a shepherd boy to
[1:16:04] being the king of Israel
[1:16:06] hallelujah and so now it's the same
[1:16:08] thing with you it is the same thing with
[1:16:11] you God seemed to vindicate a prophet in
[1:16:13] this hour I mean with a word with an
[1:16:16] anointing because his anointing in the
[1:16:17] world
[1:16:18] I mean it was pulled out the whole Horn
[1:16:20] of the anointing almost pulled out I
[1:16:21] mean upon this age hallelujah and the
[1:16:25] anointing fell upon you
[1:16:26] amen you begin to realize I'm a son and
[1:16:29] daughter of the king
[1:16:31] hallelujah I'm not mean to be just a
[1:16:32] little shepherd boy someplace or walking
[1:16:35] around in this life and doing whatever
[1:16:37] but I've got a higher calling and that's
[1:16:39] why God calls you that's why you feel
[1:16:42] something pulling your heart I mean it's
[1:16:44] because God is speaking to you God is
[1:16:47] drawing you holy because he doesn't want
[1:16:49] you just to beat Joe Bloggs on the
[1:16:51] street he wants you to walk the streets
[1:16:53] of gold hallelujah that is truth and
[1:16:58] David now remember David this is how
[1:17:01] David worked he didn't operators now how
[1:17:03] can I become king he didn't begin to
[1:17:05] strategize and plan things he says the
[1:17:09] Lord is before me he followed he
[1:17:12] followed the Lord and he didn't he
[1:17:14] didn't try and plan now how can I have a
[1:17:15] coup and take out say I'm sold on all
[1:17:17] these things he said God will take care
[1:17:19] of my enemies God will take care of him
[1:17:22] and he just walked with God because he
[1:17:25] knew at the right time in the right
[1:17:26] season he'll be sitting on the throne
[1:17:29] when he is ready he'll be on the throne
[1:17:32] and it's all of the being a fugitive in
[1:17:35] his own country and being on the run
[1:17:36] from Saul and going down to the
[1:17:38] Philistines and everything he did was
[1:17:40] training amen because God had to train
[1:17:44] him do you trust me in the good times do
[1:17:46] you trust me in the bad time you trust
[1:17:49] me when you think things are secure you
[1:17:51] trust me when you have to be ran off
[1:17:52] your own thrown by your son do you trust
[1:17:54] me it's got to be the same thing with
[1:17:57] you do you trust him in the good times
[1:17:59] do you trust him in the bad times do you
[1:18:02] trust him when you think what's going to
[1:18:03] happen to me hallelujah
[1:18:05] you trust him because that's that's
[1:18:08] that's what God's sons and daughters
[1:18:10] that's what he wants them to be like I
[1:18:12] mean brother Mary speaks of the tutor

[1:20:02] sees a man with some camels and
[1:20:04] something and then and then he says can

[1:20:23] damsel and then and then before he gets
[1:20:25] to the city he prays Lord made the one
[1:20:28] who comes out and offers me drinking
[1:20:30] waters my camels may she be the one and
[1:20:32] so now she has no idea this is all going
[1:20:35] on she's just she's just living life
[1:20:36] it's an everyday kind of thing going on
[1:20:39] and then and then and then early ages of

[1:20:57] heart's being prepared even before he
[1:20:59] came God sent his angel to me hallelujah
[1:21:02] and I responded and I've sinned Oh God

[1:21:11] don't know how you did it it was just
[1:21:12] everyday kind of thing maybe spoke to
[1:21:14] someone I don't know any now and then
[1:21:16] and in the enormity the reality really
[1:21:19] sets in this is the voice of God to this
[1:21:22] generation and it was five it was ten to
[1:21:24] find a bride is a bridegroom who wants
[1:21:27] to be united to a bride hallelujah and

[1:21:36] something to you
[1:21:37] I sure a trust it does hallelujah now
[1:21:42] yes are you were still in Romans chapter
[1:21:45] eight so now you have not received the
[1:21:48] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[1:21:49] received a spirit of adoption whereby we
[1:21:52] cry Abba Father hallelujah that means
[1:21:56] the world to me I know who my father is
[1:21:59] nothing about my natural father I know
[1:22:01] who my real father is hallelujah and all
[1:22:04] of his children will be there all
[1:22:07] everyall the father has given me will
[1:22:09] come to me and all that comes we are no
[1:22:11] wise cast out amen
[1:22:14] so don't worry about well am i or am I
[1:22:17] not just come to him lord I come to you
[1:22:20] hallelujah
[1:22:22] remember if there's a pull in your heart
[1:22:23] it's because he wants you to come
[1:22:25] hallelujah and he put that in there you
[1:22:28] didn't put that in there
[1:22:29] you didn't desire he put something in
[1:22:31] you I must come I'm asking of my life I
[1:22:34] must serve this Jesus hallelujah out of
[1:22:37] love you know
[1:22:37] you know what I mean I'm just I'm just
[1:22:39] going to preach my testimony for a
[1:22:41] little bit but yeah there's that bird
[1:22:43] there's something in you and you get
[1:22:44] sick of what life really are there's
[1:22:46] more to life than us and you're not
[1:22:48] happy with the status quo of life oh god
[1:22:51] you get stirred up and then he finds you
[1:22:54] it's his doing I mean and if children to
[1:22:58] the spirit beareth witness with our
[1:22:59] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:23:00] and if children then where is is of God
[1:23:04] jointly is with Christ if so be we
[1:23:07] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:23:09] glorified together so he's saying now
[1:23:12] who knows who their daddy is hallelujah
[1:23:17] amen then that means now where is we
[1:23:20] fool it everything he received amen and
[1:23:23] we're not just is we're joint is that
[1:23:26] means that means everything that he
[1:23:28] received we receive hallelujah just like
[1:23:31] I heard someone say about Muhammad Ali
[1:23:34] and as and as and his wife Muhammad Ali
[1:23:36] he trained he went into the ring he
[1:23:40] trained he fought he comes his wife
[1:23:43] maybe sits on the front row
[1:23:45] watches the belt you know but then the
[1:23:48] paycheck comes and she receives it
[1:23:51] everything he earned in the fight
[1:23:54] although everything he had to go through
[1:23:56] she just receives it she didn't have to
[1:23:57] go into the ring she didn't have to
[1:23:59] train she'd never do all those things
[1:24:01] but she received the check hallelujah
[1:24:04] jesus paid it off he went to Calvary on
[1:24:07] our behalf I mean when he was on the
[1:24:09] cross you're on his mind
[1:24:11] a many purchased our salvation and we
[1:24:14] received the check
[1:24:15] hallelujah we receive eternal life glory
[1:24:19] to God they made so if we suffer with
[1:24:21] him we're bearing his reproach that we
[1:24:24] may be also be glorified together for I
[1:24:27] reckon that our sufferings of this
[1:24:29] present time are not worthy to be
[1:24:31] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:24:33] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:24:35] expectation of the creature waiteth now
[1:24:38] this word creature actually means
[1:24:39] creation for the earnest expectation of
[1:24:42] the creation waitis for the
[1:24:44] manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:24:47] this word manifestation means revealing
[1:24:49] that's like within David there was a
[1:24:53] king that King had to be revealed right
[1:24:56] it's the same thing yo with with any of
[1:24:59] the believers down through there was a
[1:25:01] revealing of what they mean to live out
[1:25:02] just like Peter James and John and a
[1:25:05] sailboat they weren't meant to stay in
[1:25:07] the sailboat they were just
[1:25:08] to say fishermen and then was apostles
[1:25:10] hallelujah and then was the you know you
[1:25:14] know and then was you like Peter he had
[1:25:15] the keys of the kingdom that was what
[1:25:18] was in them the woman at the well in
[1:25:20] here was to be a daughter of God
[1:25:22] hallelujah
[1:25:23] she wasn't mean to be just the woman at
[1:25:25] the well Liam wasn't mean to be just
[1:25:27] Legion with a thousand odd Devils in him
[1:25:28] that wasn't there had to be a rare
[1:25:30] revealing what was really in them
[1:25:32] that's what Jesus came in their way Tolu
[1:25:36] yeah just like the Apostle Paul he
[1:25:38] wasn't mean to be he wasn't mean to be a
[1:25:40] Pharisee he was mean to be the Apostle
[1:25:43] the first church age messenger and
[1:25:46] that's the same thing with you I want to
[1:25:48] labor on this because you got to really
[1:25:50] say your look at yourself saying Who am
[1:25:52] I really what am I really am I am i say
[1:25:56] bought at a certain place and you know a
[1:25:58] certain family in certain culture is
[1:26:00] that who I really am
[1:26:01] no Amen you say some of you can say
[1:26:06] glory to God I don't know but you should
[1:26:08] recognize I'm not just I'm a son or
[1:26:12] daughter of the king that's who I really
[1:26:15] am but there has to be a revealing I
[1:26:17] mean the life that's in you has to come
[1:26:19] forth but it has to be anointed it has
[1:26:21] to come alive how lujah and then once it
[1:26:24] does you can't stop it you can't stop it
[1:26:28] hallelujah I'm glad you can't stop it
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:31] because even if you fight against it God
[1:26:34] will get you into a place where you'll
[1:26:37] say now then your head then you have to
[1:26:39] say now you have my attention now I give
[1:26:42] up
[1:26:42] and I wouldn't fight against God and say
[1:26:45] God I quit you take over for the
[1:26:50] creature was also subject to vanity not
[1:26:52] willingly but by reason of him who
[1:26:54] subjected the same in hopes that's when
[1:26:56] Adam four-footed has rights to save Eve
[1:26:58] because the creature itself also shall
[1:27:01] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:27:03] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:27:04] the children of God before we know that
[1:27:07] the whole creation groaneth and
[1:27:08] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:27:10] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:27:13] which have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[1:27:15] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:27:17] waiting for the adoption to work the
[1:27:20] redemption of our body
[1:27:22] our trust is a groaning I trust is a
[1:27:26] groaning in you I wanna I want to take
[1:27:30] off this thing put on an eternal body I
[1:27:33] mean I want to be I don't want to stay
[1:27:35] in this place you know the whole world
[1:27:38] has gone through birth pains the whole
[1:27:40] world is travailing brother band
[1:27:42] preacher swim and birth pains and he
[1:27:44] said the first for first world war was a
[1:27:46] birth pain and in the second world war
[1:27:49] was another birth pain and that birth
[1:27:51] pain was far greater than the first
[1:27:53] because they get stronger and stronger
[1:27:54] amen and then now there's been a it's
[1:27:57] been a season now where God held back
[1:28:00] the third birth pain this is just me
[1:28:02] because this elected ones had to come in
[1:28:04] the 144,000 had to be in Israel
[1:28:07] hallelujah and that's why God is
[1:28:09] long-suffering not willing that any
[1:28:11] would Pierce but all would come to
[1:28:12] repentance
[1:28:13] that's because he's going to hold back
[1:28:14] the destruction I mean to make sure all
[1:28:17] of his children are gathered to the gana
[1:28:19] hallelujah glory that's why we're still
[1:28:22] here that's why we're still here and
[1:28:24] then the third birth pain will be yeah
[1:28:27] the tribulation it'll be far worse every
[1:28:31] far worse than anything this world has
[1:28:33] ever seen it will be but for those who
[1:28:38] are bidden to come and have accepted the
[1:28:41] invitation they'll be on the streets of
[1:28:43] gold I mean they'll be in a wedding
[1:28:45] supper of the Lamb
[1:28:46] hallelujah but the world that's why this
[1:28:47] world is falling apart that's why
[1:28:49] nature's falling apart
[1:28:50] I mean society is falling apart is
[1:28:53] because this world has to give way to
[1:28:55] birth a new world hallelujah and we we
[1:28:59] friends are on our way out of here
[1:29:02] amen he say well you've said that for
[1:29:05] about I bet I believed that for 10 years
[1:29:07] and I believe it more now than when I
[1:29:09] first believed I mean the promise is
[1:29:12] much closer now than when we first
[1:29:13] believed hallelujah the scripture is all
[1:29:16] coming around for a birth pain
[1:29:19] hallelujah I'm not too worried about it
[1:29:22] though
[1:29:23] remember the tribulation is a purging
[1:29:26] time he God purges nature he purges the
[1:29:30] foolish virgin he purges the world
[1:29:32] purges as well everything it's a purging
[1:29:34] and the Great Tribulation
[1:29:35] but if Jesus took out took our
[1:29:37] punishment if he paid it all
[1:29:40] haloo if he took our judgment we don't
[1:29:43] need a purging I mean the bride doesn't
[1:29:46] need to go through the tribulation to be
[1:29:47] purged I mean because she's received the
[1:29:49] fullness of the sacrifice she's received
[1:29:52] the fullness of the blood yes you should
[1:29:54] say he's talking about me Jesus he's
[1:29:57] talking about me I mean so we don't need
[1:29:59] to go through the Great Tribulation
[1:30:01] because jesus paid it all we don't need
[1:30:04] a purging when I trust we're not the
[1:30:06] foolish virgin we have oil in our lamps
[1:30:08] I mean all we care about us him so we
[1:30:14] are groaning there's something within us
[1:30:17] that would have the waiting for the
[1:30:20] adoption there's the final part of the
[1:30:21] adoption is the redemption of our body
[1:30:23] where our bodies are changed hallelujah
[1:30:27] but all of creation is groaning
[1:30:28] travailing a pain together until now
[1:30:30] it's waiting for the revealing of the
[1:30:32] sons of God I mean because when when the
[1:30:36] sons of God come to deposition and sons
[1:30:38] and daughters of God come to their
[1:30:39] position then the rapture will go and
[1:30:42] God is going to show the devil this is
[1:30:44] what my this is what Calvary does they
[1:30:48] meant because we need to talk about the
[1:30:50] effects of Calvary it's not just enough
[1:30:52] talking about about God dying on the
[1:30:54] cross for us but you're gonna say what
[1:30:56] did that achieve what did that achieve
[1:30:58] amen and you got to say what did it
[1:31:00] achieve it achieved a total cleansing of
[1:31:03] a people I mean a wiping of this Sunday
[1:31:06] so the nature could be changed that they
[1:31:08] would receive his nature hallelujah that
[1:31:10] his life would now operate in a people
[1:31:12] and live through live through them amen
[1:31:16] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[1:31:17] liveth in me
[1:31:18] that's the effects that's the purpose of
[1:31:21] Calvary as a people would be raised up
[1:31:23] hallelujah the devil would be under
[1:31:25] their feet I mean that every every work
[1:31:28] of the enemy would be trodden upon by
[1:31:30] them and they would be they would be
[1:31:32] victorious in every walk of life
[1:31:35] that's what Calvary's meant to achieve
[1:31:37] they meant Calvary's meant to achieve
[1:31:40] this no longer me and my nature is his
[1:31:42] nature then we become partakers of
[1:31:44] divine nature hallelujah that the
[1:31:47] seven virtues that Peter speaks about a
[1:31:49] built in our life and we're kept with
[1:31:51] divine love I mean that divine love is
[1:31:54] here I'm in the capstone is here I mean
[1:31:57] in the capstone as the intelligence as
[1:31:58] the head of the body hallelujah and so
[1:32:01] now in this age we have the mind of
[1:32:03] Christ amen
[1:32:05] do we not it's no longer me thinking
[1:32:08] it's his thoughts I mean it's not my
[1:32:10] ideas it's his ideas it's not my purpose
[1:32:13] that's his purpose if you have the mind
[1:32:15] of Christ I mean and we have the bride
[1:32:19] has the mind of Christ
[1:32:20] we've been kept by divine love Allu you
[1:32:24] I believe it I believe you say yes Lord
[1:32:28] that's me remember what are you looking
[1:32:33] at because what you look at you will
[1:32:35] become are you looking at Jesus Christ
[1:32:38] the word or you're looking at something
[1:32:40] else
[1:32:40] I mean now I should be single we should
[1:32:44] be beholding one thing because what you
[1:32:47] behold you will become amen
[1:32:50] it was a guy this is when I was at
[1:32:52] boarding school there's a there's a guy
[1:32:54] in my dorm he was there my friend but I
[1:32:56] thought he was cool and I started to
[1:32:58] dress like him I started to try and talk
[1:33:01] like him because I was beholding
[1:33:03] something didn't do me any good but
[1:33:08] there's always something that catches
[1:33:10] our imagination and we say I want to be
[1:33:13] like him I wanted to be like Danny
[1:33:14] Morrison whoever remembers Danny Marsh
[1:33:15] and the fast bowler I want to ball like
[1:33:18] him I want to run like came up to the
[1:33:20] wicket go right over the empire just
[1:33:23] like he did nearly taking off the guy's
[1:33:24] ear every time we Bowl I know I want to
[1:33:26] be exactly like him cuz it captured my
[1:33:28] imagination and that's what I was
[1:33:30] beholding they meant we say that's just
[1:33:34] being a little kid that's the same thing
[1:33:35] being an adult but sometimes it's more
[1:33:38] deceptive because of childish ways it's
[1:33:40] hard on its sleeve many times and you
[1:33:42] can do they just transparent but an
[1:33:44] adult when they get older when people
[1:33:46] get older they can hide what they really
[1:33:47] are
[1:33:48] so what are you beholding I want to
[1:33:52] behold him because when we see him we
[1:33:55] shall be like him I wonder if I have
[1:33:57] that in he because it speaks about the
[1:33:58] appearing
[1:34:00] yeah here it is here behold what manner
[1:34:02] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:34:05] hallelujah now we should be called the
[1:34:08] sons of God
[1:34:09] wherefore the world knows us not because
[1:34:11] it knew him not beloved now we are the
[1:34:15] sons of God now not all one day one day
[1:34:20] one day no now well one day when I get
[1:34:23] mature my walk
[1:34:24] no now you are my girls are my daughters
[1:34:27] soon as I born there a daughter amen
[1:34:32] of whatever I have which is not you know
[1:34:35] but they work.they
[1:34:36] I don't have to wait well now you have
[1:34:37] to become of age than you my daughter
[1:34:39] know they always my daughters but
[1:34:41] there's a life in them they're growing
[1:34:42] you know maturing they couldn't eat you
[1:34:46] know they couldn't eat sold food then
[1:34:47] they learned how to eat solid food
[1:34:48] they couldn't crawl then they learned
[1:34:50] how to crawl they couldn't walk with it
[1:34:51] alone how to work Oh walk they couldn't
[1:34:54] run then they learned how to run I mean
[1:34:57] they couldn't draw then they're learning
[1:34:58] how to draw they couldn't write now
[1:34:59] they're learning how to write they
[1:35:00] couldn't read now they're learning how
[1:35:02] to read because there's a growth is a
[1:35:04] life that's growing as the same thing
[1:35:07] with us we can just be a new bulb
[1:35:09] newborn babe in Christ now you are a son
[1:35:12] of God now you are I mean as soon as
[1:35:15] you're burst into the kingdom by the
[1:35:16] Holy Ghost remember us were sons though
[1:35:19] I mean because we are sons he said for
[1:35:22] those Holy Spirit sees in Galatians
[1:35:24] right but then now God God has to anoint
[1:35:28] your life to bring forth the real you
[1:35:31] but then there's a life in you that
[1:35:34] begins to mature and grow as long as
[1:35:36] there's a maturity and a growth just
[1:35:37] keep walking now this is what you think
[1:35:40] is your maturity to growth we're gonna
[1:35:41] look back a year ago and what are you
[1:35:44] now are you more like Kemeny less like
[1:35:46] him or are you standing still if you're
[1:35:50] standing still or being less like him
[1:35:52] you say Lord I want to surrender I meant
[1:35:56] but if you're being more like him he
[1:35:57] said Lord continue working
[1:36:01] beloved now we are the sons of God it
[1:36:03] shall not appear what we shall be but we
[1:36:05] know that when he shall appear we shall
[1:36:08] be like him for he we will shall see him
[1:36:11] as he is now this is just an
[1:36:13] fellowship but brother brother Bram
[1:36:17] talks about there's a difference between
[1:36:18] the appearing and the coming of Christ
[1:36:21] and he spoke about when the Son of Man
[1:36:24] is being revealed that is the appearing
[1:36:27] it's also part of the coming but he said
[1:36:29] though the Holy Ghost is now appearing
[1:36:31] among us amen
[1:36:34] so but we know when he shall appear he's
[1:36:37] appeared in this last age he walks among
[1:36:40] us it's not just recorded on tape he
[1:36:43] walks among us now that same God walks
[1:36:45] among us Amen is that is it ok with
[1:36:49] everyone is the difference between the
[1:36:51] appearing and the coming right answer
[1:36:54] now he is it he is appearing among us
[1:36:57] he's also started as coming but it's
[1:37:00] coming hasn't finished because I'm still
[1:37:01] in this body and the dead in Christ are
[1:37:04] having arisen yet I'm looking for them
[1:37:07] they meant but God will get us ready if
[1:37:09] you're a prisoner to him God will get
[1:37:11] you ready
[1:37:13] amen that when the dead in Christ rise
[1:37:15] you will see them he say well I've never
[1:37:17] seen a real believer you know that's
[1:37:19] died they'll make sure you know who they
[1:37:21] hear just me amen so he's so when when
[1:37:27] he shall appear we shall be like him so
[1:37:29] now he's appearing among us
[1:37:31] why is he appear among us as to mold us
[1:37:34] and shape us that we shall be like him
[1:37:36] for we shall see him as he is
[1:37:40] there's no Creed's and dogmas anymore
[1:37:43] we're not looking through a glass darkly
[1:37:45] anymore it's not smoke and mirrors and I
[1:37:47] think and I think and maybe and what
[1:37:49] does this group of scholars say and what
[1:37:51] does this group of scholars say what
[1:37:52] does this group of scholars say God seem
[1:37:55] to vindicate a prophet that we would
[1:37:56] know and God over vindicated it that we
[1:38:01] know exactly the person of God because
[1:38:04] this message is a person this is Jesus
[1:38:06] being revealed amen
[1:38:09] so when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:38:11] him that's why I trust you can see I
[1:38:14] trust you look at your members character
[1:38:15] he's looking for character brother
[1:38:17] Brahim said I don't have the quote
[1:38:18] obviously is the kingdom of God as a
[1:38:19] nature it's a nature the kingdom of God
[1:38:22] is a nature what does that mean it says
[1:38:24] it's a it's a it's a character
[1:38:27] ristic my characteristic young but Jesus
[1:38:30] had the nature of God because he was God
[1:38:32] the fruits of the spirit are spoken
[1:38:34] about I mean and when that comes into
[1:38:36] you know when his life comes into you it
[1:38:38] will produce that character will produce
[1:38:40] that nature right and so he's here to
[1:38:46] make us like him he has appeared and
[1:38:53] we'll see him as he is we do see him as
[1:38:56] he is this is not mental gymnastics you
[1:38:58] know there's still people that debate is
[1:39:00] he 3 2 or 1 or is he just a whole
[1:39:02] pantheon of a million of them like the
[1:39:04] Mormons we know that there's only one
[1:39:07] that manifests himself in 3 different
[1:39:09] ways right so we know who he is we have
[1:39:15] seen him in this day hallelujah and I'm
[1:39:19] not just talking about a photograph on
[1:39:20] Mount sunset or a photograph of the
[1:39:22] pillar of fire that's God they're not
[1:39:25] the Prophet by the pillar far above them
[1:39:27] if they could take a photograph in Egypt
[1:39:30] with when Moses was there you just
[1:39:32] replace the Prophet with Moses and that
[1:39:35] same pillar of fire would have been
[1:39:36] there
[1:39:37] Alleluia and so now the thing is he has
[1:39:42] appeared among us two molars and Seamus
[1:39:44] into his into his image and that's why
[1:39:48] God God takes his word in this end time
[1:39:50] and it's not just a learning but God
[1:39:54] takes his word and by faith when you
[1:39:56] receive that word the anointing of the
[1:39:58] Holy Ghost quickens that word to your
[1:40:00] makes it live I meant because it's the
[1:40:03] law of faith that we live by as he
[1:40:05] wasn't following me III probably not
[1:40:07] jumping around too much but remember
[1:40:09] there's a law of faith that we live by
[1:40:10] and that law of faith is God reveals us
[1:40:13] would to you you say I believe it and
[1:40:15] then by receiving it into your heart it
[1:40:17] produces what that word says I mean so
[1:40:20] when it says that there will be a bride
[1:40:21] without spot or wrinkle washed in the
[1:40:23] blood of lamb made in His image made in
[1:40:26] his likeness
[1:40:26] she brother bear says she is him because
[1:40:29] husband or wife become one you know and
[1:40:32] then something and you says Amen and
[1:40:35] then you begin to see now the Holy
[1:40:37] Spirit takes that because you've got to
[1:40:38] agree you can't just sit back
[1:40:40] just you know you gotta say amen I think
[1:40:44] maybe I did did say but when brother
[1:40:47] Alfa was preaching I was sitting back in
[1:40:48] that back corner he's praying about the
[1:40:50] Holy Ghost in these things I just begin
[1:40:52] to say Amen I agree
[1:40:55] I felt the Spirit of God just fall on me
[1:40:57] hallelujah
[1:40:59] those glorious but before that it was
[1:41:01] just to what your wonderful suits but
[1:41:02] when I really said yes and I joined
[1:41:05] myself to that word that was coming
[1:41:06] forth and saying I agree hallelujah and
[1:41:10] the Spirit of God fell upon me out a
[1:41:11] glorious time that's why you've got to
[1:41:14] say yes and doesn't matter how you how
[1:41:16] you feel about well are you worthy to
[1:41:19] receive it none of us are worthy it
[1:41:21] doesn't matter what you think about
[1:41:22] yourself and your battles and your
[1:41:24] struggles and how you successful you
[1:41:26] think you own your walk you say Amen I
[1:41:29] believe your work be it unto me
[1:41:31] according to thy word I'm in the Oh fine
[1:41:34] when you receive it in faith you'll see
[1:41:35] it produce itself hallelujah you say
[1:41:38] well I'm not worthy to be a sad Oh
[1:41:40] daughter of God who cares about what you
[1:41:42] think cuz the devil will try and tell
[1:41:44] you you're not worthy you fail all the
[1:41:46] time look at your thought life look at
[1:41:48] your prayer life is in ruins your
[1:41:50] reading your everything of your
[1:41:52] Christian life is in ruins you could say
[1:41:53] that may be true but say God I want to
[1:41:56] get back up I believe your word
[1:41:59] hallelujah be it unto me according to
[1:42:01] thy word and you'll find something
[1:42:03] happened to you hallelujah I believe
[1:42:06] that with all my heart
[1:42:07] it's the law of faith that we live by
[1:42:09] the just shall live by faith
[1:42:12] amen don't be don't be caught up in the
[1:42:15] magnitude of all these are going to be a
[1:42:17] revealing of the sons and daughters of
[1:42:19] God in the same time you find yourself
[1:42:22] you'll find yourself thinking it's too
[1:42:24] far away it's too great how could I ever
[1:42:26] obtain to that no faith says the word is
[1:42:29] nigh thee even in thy mouth so the
[1:42:31] promise isn't far away the promises in
[1:42:33] you I mean the promises I possess it I
[1:42:36] have the promise that's what faith says
[1:42:38] I mean Caleb Caleb came out of Egypt he
[1:42:42] was a slave he seized a mountain where
[1:42:44] the resurrection will happen he didn't
[1:42:46] know was going to happen there but there
[1:42:48] was a resurrection mountain and he says
[1:42:50] to Joshua give me my Mountain
[1:42:53] hey man I'm 84 years old I'm just as
[1:42:55] strong now as I was when I came out
[1:42:57] hallelujah
[1:42:58] give me my mountain and then Joshua says
[1:43:00] I give you this mountain he didn't say
[1:43:02] you know he didn't get caught up and I
[1:43:05] was a slave he probably had the scars on
[1:43:07] his back of the whips he is carrying
[1:43:09] those for 84 years or however long it
[1:43:12] was they meant carrying those 40 years
[1:43:14] through the wilderness maybe he could he
[1:43:16] could feel it through us through what
[1:43:18] every war but it didn't keep him bound
[1:43:21] down he was looking at a promise he was
[1:43:24] looking at I'm going to receive an
[1:43:25] inheritance I don't care about the
[1:43:27] whoops and the slaver and my memory
[1:43:29] let's not be a slave to our memories I
[1:43:31] mean who cares about what we did and
[1:43:33] where we were problem whatever it should
[1:43:36] be under the blood of Christ I mean your
[1:43:38] whole life should be confessed under his
[1:43:40] blood hallelujah Josh Caleb looked at
[1:43:43] the promise how about you because there
[1:43:47] were other people that came out maybe
[1:43:49] they worked with Caleb they received the
[1:43:52] same beatings they received the same
[1:43:54] cruel treatment and they felt the same
[1:43:57] marks and they said we're grasshoppers
[1:44:00] in their sight we can't take it don't be
[1:44:05] like those people don't be like those
[1:44:08] people because you had to think why is
[1:44:10] God called me out you know if they
[1:44:13] really set for one second of thought why
[1:44:15] are we not in Egypt anymore let's think
[1:44:17] about this for a second why are we not
[1:44:19] slaves in Egypt anymore why didn't he
[1:44:22] send a prophet and the Red Sea open and
[1:44:24] all the great things why did this happen
[1:44:26] why did he say put the blood of the door
[1:44:28] lintels of our house and the Death Angel
[1:44:30] passed over the land and we were safe
[1:44:32] why did that happen
[1:44:33] why did we march out why are we here and
[1:44:37] if they really thought that that's a
[1:44:38] it's because God wants to take us here
[1:44:40] he wants the places in the land that's
[1:44:43] what they should have thought about and
[1:44:44] you got to think about it now why have I
[1:44:46] heard a supernatural voice well have I
[1:44:48] maybe left my associates and what I used
[1:44:51] to do in something call me here
[1:44:53] why is he done that he hasn't brought
[1:44:55] you out here just to die he hasn't
[1:44:57] brought you out here just to have some
[1:44:58] miserable existence he brought you out
[1:45:00] here to be full of joy and rejoicing
[1:45:02] full of the Holy Ghost amen to be placed
[1:45:04] in your own here
[1:45:05] hallelujah that's why he's brought you
[1:45:07] out here you got to look at where is he
[1:45:10] taking you I don't care about whereof
[1:45:12] being there's a reason I had to walk
[1:45:14] that way but I'm not walking that way
[1:45:16] again I mean they didn't go back into
[1:45:18] the wilderness after they cross the
[1:45:20] river Jordan they went into their
[1:45:21] inheritance
[1:45:22] hallelujah it's got to be the same thing
[1:45:24] with us oh but I've had quite a life
[1:45:27] we've all had quite a life and God
[1:45:29] allowed you to go through that life
[1:45:31] because God had to put something in you
[1:45:32] that when you find someone else who's
[1:45:34] struggling with the same thing you
[1:45:36] struggle with you can enter into their
[1:45:38] burden and pray for them and God can
[1:45:39] come on the scene hallelujah there's a
[1:45:42] reason
[1:45:42] nothing's in vain now there's in the
[1:45:47] token message and when God made the
[1:45:49] first man he made him a son and the son
[1:45:52] was so corrupt he listened to his wife
[1:45:54] and said of God and the wife listened to
[1:45:55] the devil instead of her husband and
[1:45:57] when it did it was so corrupted them
[1:45:59] together that it brought a pollution and
[1:46:01] he knew that when they did that they'd
[1:46:04] have to bring children to the world the
[1:46:05] fruit in the midst of the tree could not
[1:46:07] be touched and then when it was they
[1:46:09] brought the sin upon themselves and
[1:46:10] where for the whole human race was born
[1:46:12] was in sin there was no way to come out
[1:46:16] there was no way to come out you were
[1:46:20] born in that condition there was no way
[1:46:22] to come out that's pretty bad but it's
[1:46:27] going on and when God came down there's
[1:46:29] only one way he could get him back that
[1:46:31] was to get him back a son again just
[1:46:33] talking about you there's only way to
[1:46:35] get you back as to any way to get back
[1:46:38] and how can he do it when his own law
[1:46:40] stood there and he said he's condemned
[1:46:42] when the father himself became one of us
[1:46:45] that's the real Lamb that's his purpose
[1:46:48] he had in his mind hallelujah amen
[1:46:52] that's the reason the lamb was so
[1:46:53] identified in the Garden of Eden knowing
[1:46:55] that the lamb and of would meet at one
[1:46:57] time when the lamb and of would be
[1:46:59] together that's when he knows through
[1:47:01] that we can all be together
[1:47:03] and he was willing to make such a
[1:47:04] sacrifice now that token could be
[1:47:07] applied that we are no more aliens we
[1:47:10] are no more strangers amen but we are
[1:47:13] sons and daughters of God and in both
[1:47:16] Adam and Eve them
[1:47:17] the woman and the men joined together as
[1:47:19] sons and daughters of God and Jesus
[1:47:21] Christ by his great sacrifice so the
[1:47:24] Bible says were no more aliens we're no
[1:47:26] more strangers were no more foreigners
[1:47:28] and member we're all citizens of the
[1:47:30] kingdom of God by the blood of Jesus
[1:47:33] Christ amen he broke down that middle
[1:47:35] wall of partition he bridged that gulf
[1:47:38] hallelujah I'm just going to be happy
[1:47:40] for a little bit he bridge that gulf any
[1:47:42] one time oz his enemy
[1:47:44] I mean when we were yet in sin he loved
[1:47:46] us people say God has never loved me no
[1:47:49] while you were yen and sin he died for
[1:47:51] you amen hallelujah so now we are once
[1:47:54] you know it's like when you come into
[1:47:57] your country of origin or all the other
[1:48:00] nationalities they need visas they need
[1:48:02] whatever they knew but you can just walk
[1:48:04] in with your passport and you just go
[1:48:06] through your own gate and you're in but
[1:48:08] you're back on your home soil
[1:48:09] hallelu that you you know the saw you
[1:48:11] came out of I mean where your identity
[1:48:14] is now that's just a natural a natural
[1:48:16] land I remember there in God God gives
[1:48:20] us this holy spirit the token I mean you

[1:48:24] it's waning you know this is where you
[1:48:26] are from Emme brings you back to your
[1:48:28] homeland brings you back to you to the
[1:48:31] Word of God your homeland hallelujah and
[1:48:33] you begin to walk upon the word I mean
[1:48:35] back in familiar places and you begin to
[1:48:37] realize I came out of this soil I came
[1:48:40] out of this word hallelujah you mean to
[1:48:43] say this is my identity
[1:48:44] I mean they say history tells us when
[1:48:48] the Jews from the Holocaust they they
[1:48:50] they came back to Israel some of them
[1:48:53] still had the start you're the other
[1:48:55] stars on them and all the things that
[1:48:56] the Nazis gave them but when they came
[1:48:58] into Israel they changed their garments
[1:49:00] they put on different ones holy the
[1:49:03] dinar oh no you know no longer ones who
[1:49:05] are prisoners of war but they came back
[1:49:07] to their homeland and they put on a new
[1:49:09] identity I mean we didn't just survive
[1:49:11] the Holocaust now we're in our land
[1:49:13] hallelujah that's the same thing with
[1:49:15] you and I friends this world as a death
[1:49:17] camp do you know that this world is a

[1:49:29] that thing you got to take off your

[1:49:33] garment hallelujah because we're no
[1:49:35] longer just people have come out of the
[1:49:37] death camp I never put on a new identity
[1:49:39] we have a new passport hallelujah we are
[1:49:43] sons and daughters of God glory to God
[1:49:46] now then you know this is all from the
[1:49:48] token message Same Same Same s it's the
[1:49:52] New Testament it's New Covenant new life
[1:49:54] shows Jesus has met every requirement
[1:49:57] for us that God required to make us back
[1:49:59] truly sons and daughters of God under
[1:50:01] the blood where there is no more
[1:50:03] condemnation hallelujah as Jesus said be
[1:50:07] he perfect as your father in heaven is
[1:50:09] perfect
[1:50:10] now we can look at that saying well how
[1:50:12] could I be perfect you know I have my
[1:50:15] struggles I've got my humanity which is
[1:50:16] very much alive you know how could I
[1:50:18] ever become perfect but the reason he
[1:50:21] said be perfect is because he was the
[1:50:23] perfect lamb he was the perfect
[1:50:25] sacrifice and God demands perfection and
[1:50:28] the only way he could make you perfect
[1:50:30] this to give himself as a perfect
[1:50:31] sacrifice
[1:50:32] amen to that life that was in that
[1:50:34] sacrifice comes unto you hallelujah
[1:50:37] so we are amen Jesus met every
[1:50:40] requirement amen the Christ not the
[1:50:44] cross plus and the Philadelphian age
[1:50:46] with John Wesley they believed that was
[1:50:49] the blood and their own good behavior
[1:50:50] you go read about in the church age book
[1:50:53] but in this age it is the blood alone
[1:50:55] amen it is the cross alone I mean it is
[1:50:58] that sacrifice alone hallelujah and the
[1:51:01] life that was in him comes unto you
[1:51:03] I'm sorry aren't you glad it's that way
[1:51:05] onion glad for his Holy Spirit
[1:51:06] I need glad for his quickening power in
[1:51:08] you and you're glad for his life the
[1:51:10] very one that said let there be Sun Moon

[1:51:15] you hallelujah by one offering Amen he
[1:51:18] comes and steps into your flesh and sees
[1:51:20] long enough you're gonna be the place of
[1:51:22] my rest
[1:51:24] amen where there is no condemnation
[1:51:28] Romans 8:1 says there is therefore no
[1:51:30] now no condemnation to that that are in
[1:51:33] not those who are believing it but those
[1:51:36] who are in Christ Jesus that
[1:51:37] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:51:39] and my word is spirit and life see Oh
[1:51:42] couldn't I take a text that stay for a
[1:51:44] couple more hours but we're over at you
[1:51:46] see he says no more condemnation free
[1:51:49] from sin free from the cares of the
[1:51:51] world
[1:51:51] no no condemn why to them that have been
[1:51:54] by one spirit baptized into one body

[1:52:09] God how you doing today hallelujah
[1:52:12] your character is God's character
[1:52:14] because his life is in you what is it a
[1:52:17] little pushover no sure God is a God of
[1:52:19] judgment he is a God of correct it must
[1:52:22] be online nothing else to do that's the
[1:52:24] kind of character you are because you're
[1:52:26] the character of your father see what
[1:52:28] the life watch it the are the life the
[1:52:31] life out as took for the blood see the
[1:52:34] life itself was took see the life it
[1:52:37] took for the blood seeped the blood was
[1:52:39] applied and the life could no more
[1:52:41] come on the believed of him for the life
[1:52:43] of an animal so he's talking about now
[1:52:45] an animal sacrifice but instead no this
[1:52:48] is in Spanish too but I got to read this
[1:52:50] so I couldn't put it in together cuz I
[1:52:51] don't know where it split he says but
[1:52:54] see instead of a human being it was a
[1:52:56] super super super human being see and
[1:52:58] that makes the human being now not only
[1:53:01] a human being but he's a son and a
[1:53:05] daughter of God of the super super super
[1:53:07] super life that was in him like that
[1:53:11] comes back upon you and changes you from
[1:53:14] a sinner and the things of the world a
[1:53:16] church member and a denomination of God
[1:53:18] to a born-again Christian filled with
[1:53:21] the spirit the life of God just flowing
[1:53:23] from you like sparks from an anvil as
[1:53:25] you walk full of virtue and love and
[1:53:27] gentleness as the Holy Spirit moving
[1:53:30] speaking our mind there you are and with
[1:53:32] them with what hearing the message
[1:53:34] watching the pillar of fire and the
[1:53:35] blessed assurance I pass from death to
[1:53:37] life no there's no condemnation at all
[1:53:40] that's the same one in Spanish now I
[1:53:43] mean to that's that's how it should be
[1:53:45] Alleluia where you see his character his
[1:53:47] life in you glory to God
[1:53:51] a man that is his life his nature
[1:53:54] amen everything he is it's like sparks
[1:53:59] from an anvil hallelujah I have passed
[1:54:02] from death unto life amen
[1:54:05] how we do we are no longer slaves we are
[1:54:11] sons and daughters of God not one day we
[1:54:15] are now and if Moses and his position
[1:54:18] could say let there be you know flies or
[1:54:20] frogs or whatever those plagues came
[1:54:22] down he wasn't eat he said let my people
[1:54:26] go
[1:54:26] he knew what his commission was let my
[1:54:29] people go and he went down into Egypt
[1:54:31] and he did everything his lip remember
[1:54:34] his yielded to the Spirit of God sure BC
[1:54:36] will not leave one who fought he didn't
[1:54:37] negotiate with the enemy this is a son
[1:54:40] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:54:41] he didn't negotiate it and so if you
[1:54:43] take this all take this he says I'm
[1:54:45] taking you at all and you're receiving
[1:54:46] nothing I'm leaving with everything
[1:54:48] Elliot didn't matter how hard had the
[1:54:51] heart of Pharaoh got he says they were
[1:54:54] we are leaving this place hallelujah
[1:54:57] and if that wasn't someone under the
[1:54:59] blood of bulls and goats how much more
[1:55:01] someone under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:55:03] I mean that the chasm has been crossed
[1:55:05] maybe there's still a gulf between God
[1:55:07] and man in the Old Testament but now
[1:55:09] that that gulf has been abolished I mean
[1:55:12] there's no gulf between us and God
