Jeremy thank you musicians I mean good morning everyone I mean so a bit of a technical difficulty this morning but here we are they have that going here we go so actually let's just read the scripture and then you can have your seats from Matthew chapter 1 [Music] so I'm a bit let's need to relax brother MCS you want to see the supernatural just relax so this coming weekend we have the youth camp up at this is two minutes past the least place up at Wesley Country Park and these are all the services and everything that's open to everyone no I'm sorry I I did put this out on whatsapp the whole

this morning we need him to come if he comes there you know it's all over I mean the battles won I mean so yes so just keep that in your prayers and be wonderful the heavy one there because for us too you know I mean let's turn to Matthew chapter 1 you know Matthew 1 now I want to just read this then we're going to go to Joshua chapter 2 that says here the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his brethren now notice here comes some woman into this and Judas begat Phares and Zara of tamer and Pharaohs forgot Israel and ester on baguette mm and mm baguette abinadab and a bit of their baguette nests on and nests on baguette Salman and cell member get Boas of Rachel that's that's Rahab and Boaz to get obed of ruth and obed to get Jesse now and this go to Joshua chapter 2 but I want to take I'm gonna probably I don't know if I'll get to both of them but I want to I want to speak on Rahab I don't want to speak on tamer this morning because we have such a battle of ourselves there's a war you know we fight against ourselves and what we foresee is our own complexes and our own humanity but I'm going to show you there's a couple of people in the scripture which is you and they are there to show you that it doesn't matter where you've come from what history you may be carrying with you the Prophet told us in no uncertain terms he never did it in the first place you're pure justified sinless perfect that's what he told us and we need to start believing that and so I just let's just read so we're not going to read the whole chapter just a save time I've just cut bits out but you can go read Joshua chapter 2 so this is before they go take Jericho's isn't Joshua the son of nun sent out of of of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into an harlots house named Rahab and Lodge there and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there come men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that had come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and this is just dropping down to verse nine and she said unto the mean I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your Tara has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did unto the two king of the emirates that are on the other side of Jordan Sehun and AAG whom you oddly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our heart Stood melt neither did they remain any more courage in any men because of you for the Lord your God here is God and heaven above and earth beneath sea he's in control of everything and now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I've showed you kindness that you will also show show kindness under my father's house and give you and give me a true token and that you'll save a life my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her by me our life for yours if ye utter not thus our business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and beholders just dropping down to verse 18 and this is gonna be our last reading here behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which their dentists lead us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother my brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thine house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our on our head if any hand be upon him Amy may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning now I want to speak so we all will understand the story of Rahab and how she had a short token we just read there she had a short token she she put that scarlet three-door rope you know out of a window every one of her family went into that house and when Israel came and they took Jericho the house it was on the top of the wall the walls fell down flatness the scripture says but the house fell with the wall but was still standing and they are all saved and Azrael took the city and then we know that the token we have today is the Holy Ghost amen at as the Holy Ghost is our token today and so we have to get ourselves in our family under this token but now we have a woman now I just want you to think about this you'd have gone to rehabs life now God is so good in this day then it doesn't matter where we're from what we've experienced in life what pains and scars and hurts and complex as we may carry now that now if you have a complex that hinders your walk with God you need to get rid of it but this but there's some there's some things that we may carry with us that we may just carry with us I mean I just trust this comes out the right way because I'm not excusing Heaven complexes but we this is me and myself I believe that if you have received him if you've received she received she was I just read this this is I've just been pondering this it sees in Rahab this isn't God's wrap gift this is the Prophet I'm sorry I don't have this in Spanish pray for more translation I mean I always search for the Spanish so harlot so Rahab the harlot that we're familiar with she being a young girl and was turned on the street by her Heath and father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring and income to them on prostitution and yet down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a God who answered prayer and the first opportunity that she got to accept that God or something to do for him she did it and God spared her life and saved her father and mother and her family she fell in love with a general in the army of Israel we find it in history married this general and their courtship was wonderful and finally they settle down and love to Bethlehem now I just want you have to go into the Bible character she didn't say now let's all be adults today can we be adults if I just say some you know when she was a little girl I doubt very much she would have had in her mind she's gonna end up as a harlot this is not this wouldn't have been her plan but the Prophet says here that her parents turned her out and used her to get an income for for them now I just want to lay it real real thick for a little bit there's nothing of our past that can stop us from serving God there is nothing that's why God allows these people you know we know Jesus Jesus and Matthew 1 there's a natural lineage down from Abraham I mean down to Jesus being born and we understand that Jesus he was created in Mary's womb but God attributed him coming to the earth to these people these kinds of people God used to bring a faith I mean to bring that seed if I put it this way down from Abraham I meant down until it was finally manifested these are the kind of people God uses hallelujah and God is wanting you to know it doesn't matter where you're from what baggage you may be carrying what past you may have had that's irrelevant he's not worried about that he allows you to go through those things because he wasn't sure that His grace is so much greater they made it so much more powerful I mean that whatever you may have done so I want there to anchor real real real real deep because there's nothing we have no excuse his blood is greater still his atonement is greater still hallelujah it's greater than your faults and your failings and your past and what way you even be thinking at this moment it's greater than those things I mean but you've got to receive it you know if I had a billion trillion billion dollars here if I had the wealth of the world in my hand and I see it who wants this you'd be there be a punch-up in this place I mean a Black Friday sale in America and they're fighting each other and you know there'd be nothing compared to this because they even say no brother you haven't you say no I wanted and you wouldn't be judging yourself am i worthy to receive it you just come and receive it would you not you wouldn't care about you would never you would never come into the equation can I receive it you reach up and say it's mine and he had carried away and you begin to spend it you'd begin to use the wealth of the world now that's just money it's going to burn it's going to vaporize whatever is going to happen to it there will come a time where it's no more what about eternal life why is it God gives a free gift without money or price salvation is given without money or price the Holy Ghost is given without money or price you don't have to earn it you've just got to receive him you've got to receive it will you receive eternal life eternal life is far greater than the riches of the world there will be no more but if you have eternal life he still will be and you'll continue on hallelujah so why do we but it's the human at such a human condition do I deserve this have I entered am i smart enough am i great enough you gotta throw that aside amen and just say I receive it she was turned out now this is a messy you think about this if we could step in the Rahab's house before the spies came and we would ask her how's that your relationship with your parents I doubt it would be very good well how did they raise you did they treat you right no they turned me out on the street I'm keeping this up he because I wanted to Inc a real deep now actually they used me they used my body to get money for themselves this is what they did wouldn't have been a good family relationship that didn't stop God that didn't stop deliverance coming to her house I mean because the very ones look at this now they're very ones that turned her out at the very one she brought in think about that for a second the very ones that turned her out and not just fund your own house get a job you're old enough away you go no we're going to use you to feather our nest we're going to use you for our own ends that's what they were doing that's what they did and the very ones that used her and say abuse her and did not race her the right way she turned around coming to my house hallelujah coming to my house their salvation and here I have a touching and I ask you the question where did she get that rope from it was already in her house those are in her in her possession and they came a point I mean when she witchy this is just me I was driving along I fell very driving back from work this week I was thinking she has this rope I don't have a rope on me if I did I'd hold it I have the Scarlet rope I've let the spice down this is my deliverance this is my salvation this is that my deliverance not just for me but my house all that will come in this is what I need and I have it in my possession now I've just got to hang it out the window hallelujah she wasn't looking at herself and her pain and her complexes and her past she wasn't looking at that anymore her faith went into action I have the deliverance the whole city can be saved that they could fit in this place hallelujah and she begin to act not according to what she was I mean but according to the promise that she had received hallelujah the self her whole life was now being lived by Scarlett Road by faith and a short token that's how she lives hallelujah and that should be the same way we are friends it doesn't matter where you're from what complex says doesn't matter if you came from the worst family with the worst relationship with your parents whatever more there's no excuse hallelujah I trust you've received headed in her house do you understand me they didn't say call here we brought this with us in you put it up no she had it at her house she was leading the spies down with the very thing that was going to be was going to save her in her house think about that for a second and here we are you say well how does that work and the believer is a seed it's a gene seed of God and it can be buried under a lot of concrete it can be buried under a lot of pain and can bury under a lot of hardship and regret and you know mistakes and whatever in sin sin is just unbelief let's just put it out there sinners just unbelief in God's Word it may manifest in many different ways but it's just unbelief it can be buried in a whole bunch of that it doesn't matter how deep it is buried it must come to life I have a brother that sees it may grow around the concrete up around but eventually it will come forth and it will come out to the Prince of the Sun hallelujah don't begin to grow like it should amen doesn't matter what no don't look at what you've where you've been God allowed you to walk down that road he has the ability to protect you I mean if it was his choosing amen he would never have let those things happen but he allowed it to happen and there is a reason it happened and it's not in vain hallelujah it's not just you know we have to look at things differently we have to look at it very differently her past did not stop her from getting her family under this token her past did not stop her from receiving deliverance it did not stop her one bit and this is a heathen woman who's a prostitute some heathen idolatry and death a death sentence is over her house and it's over her city and everything she is is going to be destroyed just like this Gentile world will be destroyed Amen do you understand me it will be destroyed I mean don't put don't save up treasure on earth put treasure in heaven because where your heart is that's where your treasure will be also I mean your heart shall be upon things of here hallelujah so a whole world was going to be destroyed we read there in the scripture we know we know you're going to come take this place basically amen all the carriages left our men amen all their fortifications all of their ability to withstand a siege in there and their great things it doesn't mean anything anymore I mean their morale had gone they know they were in trouble they knew that they will get a loose amen that didn't stop her she knew or listened but the first thing she asked for when she heard we've heard a voice from another world we've heard a voice from heaven and that voice is spoken in this end time and that voice is calling and it said to this generation the Gentile world is coming to an end you're at the end of all things it's going to be burnt up I mean there will be a nuclear war upon the earth whether you like it or not someone's going to push a button then the other side will push another button and it's going to be a lot of mushroom clouds around the place it will be amen and that's not just all trying to hang a fear over the world it's going to happen it's going to happen but the Prophet tells us before the first bomb drops the bride is gone and I happen to believe that I happen to believe that Amen that before the first nuclear bomb drops a man will be on streets of gold will be dancing hallelujah and that's why he seemed a voice he sent a voice from heaven I meant to let you know the world may be ending friends but there's a there's a deliverance I mean there's a mercy I mean there's a way of escape I mean that's been declared in the same time hallelujah that you don't need to stay here and live under the fear of death and the fear of the world falling apart but you can be rejoicing I mean I've received a word I've received him he is his word you understand me this message is not you know 1,100 sermons and and doctrine and different things it's a person being declared it's a person but Jesus Christ being made dong from another world he send a voice amen and he is word do you understand me hallelujah she say you just have to receive him receive that word you said I don't understand it just receive it just receive it as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God as his in first job what does that mean I need to understand all things just receive him he will lead you and guide you into all truth shall we read that scripture let's go to John chapter 1 I don't have it on the overhead I'm sorry oh I just want to ink of this rule let's not make things complicated the devil likes to try and put scarecrows around to make things complicated forget about the complication she received she received messages from another place and they were representing the God amen that they were following and she received them and she received their word and she got mercy now John 1 and verse 11 know it says and he came unto his own this is Jesus and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so if you really receive him who's received not just he you've really received the word in your heart if you've really received him then he gives you power to become a son or daughter he you receive pass through that word to be placed as a son or daughter of God amen if you just have to receive his word that's all you need to do and that word has a power in it to make you what you are meant to be amen is that that's pretty simple if you want life receive the word if you want death you reject the word doesn't mean well I don't understand the whole thing though you just received you got have a a revelation that this message this is a voice from another world brother Branham was stand there he sees I'm standing in two worlds he's looking them at someone in the prayer line and but he's in another world he's in an eternal realm seeing seeing visions so I'm standing in two worlds why why is that he's a prophet he has access to a world that we don't know too much about amen but he's standing there and he's receiving a voice has been transmitted through him not just in visions in discernment but in a word Amen we've had a voice from another world you just got to receive him now I'm just gonna jump right to the e and I'm gonna read something but then we're gonna go back now he's talking about a blind someone who's blind we keep bumping into something this is the words he uses now the only thing who I just posed a question who walks among us who don't just look at me like what he talk about who walks among us every service who's here every sir who's here when you pray not doing about these four walls I mean but when you when you pray when you read your word when you listen to the message that quickens through your heart amen when we have prayer meeting whatever it may be who walks among us it's an eternal one hallelujah and he's coming down to influence this world amen to influence you hallelujah do you understand that we may not ever see the pillar of fire but we feel we we feel as effects I mean we feel the angels of God come around us we may never see them with our natural eyes hallelujah all of heaven friends we're not here alone in this walk I'm just going to read this now the only thing you do when you die you just change those five senses you just receive another sense and you're alive with a higher sense thousands of times higher than this in another life a life that there's no death that there's no sorrow the things you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it this is worth he's saying you're bumping into any and eternal realm you haven't got that since you say I feel a strange feeling here tonight looks to me like this I just want to cry shout or something it's the angels of the Lord amen what calls us to do these things it's it's God it's his angels it's heaven influencing this world hallelujah I say Lord I want more of it I don't want us I want you to influence this world I'm in the blood of Jesus Christ bridges the chasm puts us back on speaking terms with God hallelujah there's no gulf between us and him anymore it's been done away with hallelujah it's the angel Lord see like somebody say you know that never did have a sense of sight well once in a while I feel something real like a feeling like warmth you say it's the sunlight what a sunlight I never did see it that I know he never did see don't know what it was see somebody over there has to tell them somebody that can see it oh my see we just change we just changed don't be afraid of death do you think nothing but a scarecrow Jesus conquered it I mean that's why he comes service after service I mean prayer after prayer he walks with you I mean not that you just be anointed but you would understand this is heaven influencing you and then the eternal one is walking with us hallelujah amen now let's go back up Rahab Rahab didn't let her old life stop her we shouldn't let our old life stop us they meant she didn't have a power in that day for her to be changed to be transformed she was just not even under the blood of bulls ago she just received a scarlet rope amen and surely had it honor and so now here she was and her whole life was changed from her life of prostitution didn't she received the messengers then she put the scarlet rope down and from that moment her whole life changed and her whole life was went from went from a life of prostitution to now I've got to get these people in and they've got to receive salvation that was a whole life now this was the whole this was her walk a man was I must get these people in whoever they are I've got to go but begin hunting the predestinated seat hallelujah and as I said God speed her family the same family that put her on the street was the same family Godspeed and God used her that they would receive salvation so the same ones that mistreated her now she turned that around not because of what had happened but because of the scarlet rope what are you looking at now she wasn't looking at herself and her reputation and what other people thought about her she's like I have this I have this rope do you follow me I just want this to anchor it in real deep your and your life will actually be a proof do you have it or not the life you live will be in evidence do you have the scarlet rope or not do you have this token this your sign we can't let anything hold us back he sees this or just we're gonna read a couple of things then I'm going to go to tamer he says many people thinks today because I belong to the church I'm safely secured don't don't you believe such nonsense win the blood shall be a token unto you the spirit now is the token unto you the life that was in the blood so you gotta have the you gotta have the life that was in the blood remember it's without money or price jesus paid it all you just have to receive him you just have to receive him he says don't you rely upon know speaking in tongues now I believe in speaking tongues know nothing else but let the token itself be dia the person of Jesus Christ his own life in you circumcised not just this that but circumcise your whole being till you and Christ are one Christ in you and his life lives out through you amen now I want to go to Moses before we go to tamer Moses was 40 years on the back side of the desert as a shepherd now we don't know exactly how long he had this Shepherds rod in his hand the one that he was going to use to deliver Egypt but normally like a writer of stuff you maybe get a piece of wood you like and you begin to maybe turn it a little bit and you make it just right to fit your hand and it becomes part of you amen it becomes part of you it's just the right height right weight whatever more so he had he had this and he begins to have a debate with God why he cannot do the job we all know the story don't we I can't speak I can't do this I can't do this you know he begins to complain and God doesn't God doesn't apologize to him sorry I called the wrong fellow I mean God when God called Moses he was trying to tell Moses now it's not about what you think you are it's what I have made you to be you got to depend upon what God has made you to be amen he with me now and the rod that he was carrying was the same rod of deliverance that he would use to deliver Israel out of Egypt and to part the Red Sea and all no thanks he was carrying it maybe years up to this point but God had to come and Commission him it's not enough just for something to sit dormant and say well I'm a believer I being even baptized in water I've done this it's going to come to life you've got to come to life hallelujah and that's what he that's the reason why we have a burning bush experience that same God that was in the burning bush is here I mean that same God that spoke to Moses is here he's the same yesterday today and forever and he wasn't talk to you and say come aside a while I want to Commission you for a job hallelujah and Moses had a lot of regrets no doubt he would have had in his mind quite a lot why didn't it go right when I killed that Egyptian I I thought I planned it right maybe I should have done it this way maybe I should have done it that way I knew I was going to be the deliverer why did it go wrong and this would have been snowballing in his head for years and in and then God comes and speaks to him in the burning bush and God has dealt with him enough now it's time for him to go into service but God didn't apologize God got angry at him who made the mouth to speak amen who made the mouth to speak who made man he begins to ask him I made your mouth Moses I made you stop leaning back on your excuses and serve me amen now this is in Romans chapter 10 for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth these things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not a mine heart who shall ascend into heaven that has been Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead this is not what faces but faiths but what say that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach now let's just stop there for a so it doesn't say it's far away who's going to bring it to me faith sees I have it faith scissors of my possession they said in my mouth even in Lionheart Amen that's that that is the righteousness that is the righteousness of faith this is how it speaks it's in my possession I'm going to put it into action I'm going to not just not just hear this word but I'm going to believe it and I'm going to act upon it I'm not just going to be a hero but I'm going to be a doer I mean applying the token as a doing I mean it's not just saying a prayer and say well I've done it you put your faith into action I mean you go you you go after those ones you try to influence them towards the kingdom you say God this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost which is upon me might catch them and they may fall upon them hallelujah her whole life friends you think about this her house was a den of prostitution and then she changed it from a dinner prostitution to a House of Refuge she raped she would have had to rearrange a few things maybe open the curtains get rid of the candles whatever setup she had she had to rearrange a few things a following me her face went into action and it should be the same thing with us you know let's be honest who had some kind of faith before they came to the message I'm gonna say something real bluntly now if you are if you had a face that is country to the wood of God you're actually an idol worshiper you're actually oz worshiping Jesus no Paul said in second Thessalonians that they would that Satan would be set up in the house temple of God being worshipped as God and that's just not in the Vatican that's in every church that it takes creeds and dogmas above the Word of God and they fashion an idol so we were all a bunch of pagan idolatrous doesn't matter doesn't matter whether you like it or not that is the scripture where people take the word and they provided the word and they make it into an idol and the worshiping mat and through that Idol Satan is receiving worship above God they read your Bible so we were all idolaters we were all pagan idolatrous well I didn't know any better yeah that may be so but we were all like that and this is go another step back we're all born and sin shaped at iniquity come to the world speaking lives we were all born lost amen so we all have to come to a point where everything we once did we have to count it but dung the Apostle Paul says you gotta can your whole life your whole everything good everything bad well I did this for him I did this eunuch and all but dung you think the Apostle Paul if we went to him before he had the road to Damascus perience and we say now Paul now Saul his name was Saul now Saul you know you're working against God you know you're you're actually worshipping Satan you know that you the priests that you so admire this this Jesus the very God of the Old Testament said there of their father the devil and his works they do do you think he was saying oh really he would have got angry he would have got very angry how dare you say that about my religion howdy say that about my Bible teachers how dare you say that about my priests you're a heretic but he had attended all but done all of what he made himself to be a Pharisee of the Pharisees he had accounted all but done that he may win Christ and we have to do the same thing all of our old life you can't just say well I did this now I do this no that has to be counted but done amen are you following me it just has to be that way you have to because if you say no that was fine and now this is just a little bit bitter you'll bring a whole bunch of what you thought was fine into the better you can't do that you've got to come out of Egypt you want to call and let's see it maybe last Sunday when when Moses as parents were saying I mean you're going to be the deliverer I mean you may be raised in Pharaoh's house but you're the deliverer they would have poured into him maybe I'll Creek what I say or maybe clarified a bit more they would have poured into him you may be in Egypt but you're not meant to be in Egypt this is not your final resting place this is not your destination you'll just be here for a season don't get too attached to this world you will be gone God will call you and this season and you'll leave this place that should be what we should point to our children Prince giving us heaven is our home this is not our home we may have to have jobs in education and whatever more we build and we you know but don't dig your tits takes too deep we have to look after our families and provide and whatever more amen don't neglect those things but don't make it you're everything you're everything should be this body's going to be changed I received a short token and it's not just going to lift me above a judgement and I'm going to keep this this is going to be transformed the dead in Christ are going to rise first the same token they received as good a head has fallen upon me we should tell our children we're going to hear them and it's far greater then the best day you've ever had in this world it is far greater it's not just a wonderful day and we plan everything's nice it's far supreme to that amen time's up by 10 billion billion billion billions and that not there's anything bad in heaven but just an illustration that'll be like the worst day in heaven it's far greater than you can imagine i but i won't be able to do a whole bunch of things don't worry about what you won't be able to do I won't have a bit I won't have the devil fighting me I won't have sickness I won't have stress I won't have uncertainty I mean it's gonna be a wonderful place and that's just the minimum I mean like the smallest but heaven is a lot greater than we even really think I mean we're brother brave seed it's so sublime it's so words can't even describe it hallelujah that's what we're aiming for and we should be striving say Lord I want to rearrange my life we shouldn't our lives should be built around our walk with God not the other way around I mean because of you we should build our life can I repeat that a few times build your life around your walk with God not the other way around what a center in your life how you do your day-to-day whatever you do day-to-day whatever you may be doing build it around so if it comes in conflict with what your walk God should be then you rearrange your day amen you rearranged your day you say well that's works no you have to do something God God gave you a free moral agency this is God is not going to force us through a pipe and make us overcome amen he's relying on you to give your free moral agency over to him not just in the good times but in the hard times amen there's a truth of dying daily but first you gotta Ischl e die and be born again so it's not just in the good times it's in the times of adversity when things are hard what are you gonna chip he's gonna be a jellyfish and throw it all the way the devil doesn't take prisoners amen we have nowhere else to go I'm sorry thank you I'm not sorry heaven so wonderful just press towards heaven it'll be worth it all it'll be worth it all trust me it will be hallelujah it's so much more with now where were we yes this is faith the word is not even in thy mouth if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus thou shalt believe in thine heart that the God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made of the salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord as over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I mean and then it goes into but how can they hear on this someone has sent in how can you know you know so she received those messengers I wanna I'm running out of time but I want to read this a Gentile I hollered a streetwalker but she heard him believed she applied the token no matter how stooped you are and sin what you have done that doesn't have one thing to do with it I'm hallelujah that doesn't have one thing to do with it it doesn't matter where you're from what you've done you hear the word you receive it that's a counter to you for righteousness you apply the token it's for you if one say it's for me the Holy Ghost is for me it belongs to me the Holy Ghost is mine eternal life is mine now the devil says don't repeat after him there's power in confession as we heard on Wednesday this power they overcame him by the blood of Lamb and the word of their testimony you can't ever testimony without speaking when you come into court and you're put in the witness stand and they begin to cross-examine you and you don't say anything whether what's that gonna do what's wrong with this person they mean to have it I thought that was the star witness in the case they won't say anything hello friends you got to pray the devil says don't don't repeat don't inter end don't enjoy the service conference hallelujah don't agree don't say I mean there's what the devil tells cuz he just wants to hold you there is some statue we're not a bunch of did but a stone hallelujah doesn't matter how you feel but I'm not worthy no matter how stupid you are and sin what you have done that doesn't have one thing to do with it hallelujah you apply the token it doesn't matter what where your fro but the devil doesn't want us to enjoy it he doesn't want us to get into the spirit of the meeting young and old he doesn't want us to say yes this is for me even if it is stripes off your back just say Amen there's a reason it's it's done hallelujah and it's for our good I mean so I just say glory hallelujah be with me don't just whatever you do don't you say well he'll be done soon and we'll go out and we'll do it no this is the most glorious opportunity but the devil come in your mind and say no this is not for you you're too young he talks too fast he spits and sweats too much you know he does whatever you don't understand him this is for you I'm talking about I'm talking about receiving Jesus Christ lujah now you apply the token it's for you if you feel it in your heart there's something tugging brother that's us he says in some place he says if you feel that funny feeling you feel the fur that's just God trying to get your attention that it's for you if you feel in your heart that something's tugging it's for you you apply the token and I'd say that and even if you feel as dead as a post don't go by feelings we we believe it then we receive it we take him at his word and then we receive it so if even if I felt as did it as a post I'd say Amen you're calling me God Here I am I respond Here I am Lord I take you at your word you don't have Calvary for me Amen you are my sacrifice your blood is more than enough hallelujah you paid it all and Here I am that's what I would say you know the Prophet came in this day and he made it on he said it very clearly you never did it in the first place you are justified justified means it's not just you you're not just forgiving but you never did it in the first place so all the works of the flesh were not attributed to you in the beginning I mean all the works of your unbelief hallelujah they were never attributed to you hallelujah you never do it in the first place he understands we'll just being forgiven amen but there's no evidence I mean the blood destroys the evidence hallelujah it's not like he just turned to court tonight and the judge says well guilty not guilty and let's look at the evidence all not guilty but the evidence is there there's no evidence hallelujah this is what the blood does and there's well this message to be sent the Prophet a voice from another world came down through a vessel and said to you you never did it in the first place you're the sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ and as many as received him may be power to become the sons of God even if believe on his name hallelujah there's nothing held against us Rahab wasn't worried [Applause] I'm in the scallop that's all she cared about she wasn't right or am i worthy to have this and hang it up and do whatever more how she said I have I have my deliverance and this rope was going to take me to another world I mean because she was in her house as no mice around and then a few days later I'm in the city was no more now was under Israelite control she was in another world hallelujah what do you have in your hand what is the night hang more than just a rod more than a scarlet rope I mean by God Himself and it's not in your hand it's in your heart hallelujah what do you possess you got a look at what you have I mean if we were going to war the first thing you look at is what kind of weapons do we have and can we overcome the enemy with these weapons and if we did would say let's go we're going to win hallelujah that's the same thing with us the devil wants you to think well you've just got this little buddy like a musket or bone arrow whatever more baby you got to look at it differently David had a sling and he had some stones and those were the one thing if you looked at all the weapons of Israel Saul would have had the best sword the best spear the best armor all these things and they were just said no this won't do me any good but from a cattle cattle point of view it's saying how you're gonna kill this man with the stone he's not a bear or a lion or some kind of thing this is a different enemy but he just knew I overcome this enemy I overcome this enemy this this this glides on the same category the same level Amen as these other ones and I'll use this and you just going to take with what God has given you and then he took with what God had equipped him with and he used it and he fired that rock and it went straight to the killing place and it's down the Giants hallelujah just go with what you've got you say well I can sing sing to the glory of God I can play doesn't matter how good play to the glory of God I can pray I can have it I've got a testimony I mean I understand how how how the Prophet would testify of many things and then God would come down and people would be healed and delivered because of a testimony hallelujah Mary went to Elizabeth's house and Elizabeth had not failed John jump in her womb and a testimony and then the name of Jesus Christ brought that baby to life hallelujah what are you have in your hand what do you have use what you have I fast like this other person now God made you you use what you have hallelujah now I was gonna mention this very quickly but in the book of Genesis we're not gonna read the scripture well the whole thing it's a whole chapter that's here so I don't have it in my notes now this is Genesis 38 this is tamer tamer was married to Judas son but he was evil this is the scripture and God killed him and then so Judah told his other son you marry Tamar and then your children will actually be your brother's children but he wouldn't he wouldn't have children with tamer so God killed him and then so Judah said I have other sons but they're too young go back to your father's house until they're old enough and then you then you can marry one of them now there's something now let's just think at this think spiritually for a little bit there's something in the believer they must receive life they must receive this is not about natural natural life this is spirit there's a reason she's in the in that genealogy because Jesus had to come out of the tribe of Judah and so they had to be a child of Judah that would continue the line and the devil voice tries to stop the life coming a menace like Sarah was 25 years and and and i think even rebecca different ones they you know they couldn't have children right away because the devil tries to stop the life but there's something in the believer I must receive life now here she is something in her now this is just I I don't understand this I was dryers like my this is this is to me this is God just goes beyond and he allows a woman to deceive her father-in-law dresses up as a harlot allows her to receive - to deceive her father-in-law that she he basically uses her she becomes pregnant with his child and then he gives her his staff and Signet different things as a as a deposit for I think a goat or something that he is going to pay her worth for what they did and she becomes pregnant now Judah gets angry because she hears he hears that her daughter-in-law has been a harlot and so he says now we're gonna burn her now here's tamer know you just think about this obviously that's what they did in those days they burnt people who were caught like an adulterer of harlotry whatever more they burnt them but here she was something was moving in her I must receive life I must receive life and I'm not worried about the stigma or the potential penalty that may come upon me I don't care about what people will think of me yeah he followed me I don't care about what my family will think of me or what the community will think of me I'm wearing to take it I'm willing to take upon this shape that I would receive his life and I will have his child hallelujah because it's like if you see now it's gonna put brother our months 3 generations up on here hell they basically are Amanda's time-traveled or your grandad is time travel I'm not sure which one because they all look the same there's a family resemblance they following me it's uh I was gonna do it but anyway maybe next time but you see but it's more than just now with God it's more than just natural or he looks like this and this it's a nature to life and so she was willing something inna said I must receive the life of of the Father because I want to be a child in his image I mean I must receive that life that I'll produce a life that's just like his life hallelujah so she was willing to take upon the shame she's going to dress up as a harlot she played you hey I might get burnt I might get burned for this wickedness but God allowed it to happen because she was driven are you following me she was driven I must receive life I must produce this life hallelujah and it's the same thing now as everyone's kind of looking at me like this is a bit different but I want you to think about it there's something in the believer I don't care what people will think of me I don't care what people will say about me I don't care if they make fun of me if they think I'm weird or crazy or go off the deep end I must receive life I want to produce a life of God in me although bring your life into me may be produced I want to produce a child in your image hallelujah she was driven amen and she received it hallelujah amen and that's in the lineage of Jesus Christ God allowed that in there that God is saying there's something in in the Bride of Christ she must receive life she's driven you're driven people whether you understand or not and I and I'm just going to close with that thought and God allowed that to happen hallelujah that she would be in the lineage see you got to read that lineage it's not all the people all the most holy and the sacred and the greater than mouth and everybody's got it all together none of them had it together none of them had it in one piece none of them had it sorted never knew what was going on hallelujah they're just walking on in life and now the most I love them the most beaten scarred wounded complex human beings they you could imagine but God said it's this one I'm gonna use this one suddenly we are not going to use the other one that may that may be the right one to to to men's ideas I'll take the broken and the wounded and the complexed and the scarred and the hurt and will express my life through those people hallelujah and I'm one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them hallelujah one of them one of them are you one of them God this is God's grace he doesn't care where you're from what you've done you could have willfully did it she willfully did it I'm not excusing yo sin but she she planned it I must have life I'm going to deceive him I know this is gonna happen and then she comes out to be burnt and then she says by the man who owns this stuff and the Signet different things I have the child and he says you are more righteous than me and God attributed his son coming to the earth through that act you think about that for a second God attributed that he knew it was going to happen he knew he knew what state tamer would be in he knew our state Rahab would be in he knew what state Ruth would be in he knew what state that that Bathsheba would be in holier he knew they'd be this way because he wanted you to know this is the kind of people I use this is the kind of people I have chosen there's the kind of people I've elected I mean this is my kind of people hallelujah that's why I say don't worry about what you've done we have been the things you used to do don't worry about them they're under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean they're under his blood hallelujah and the Seavers forgetfulness hallelujah glory to God amen that's just how does friends hallelujah I think we have some musicians I mean I'm one of them alleluia alleluia Lori to God a man we need to sing that song you say what a holy God take me absolutely he took them you following me he took them he used them he'll use you you just gonna say I believe it I receive it hallelujah gonna stand with me let's Cigna sir I just pray you can just say out of your own loops more than a song I am one of them hallelujah I'm identified with Rahab I'm
