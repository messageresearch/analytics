[0:02] come and worship and praise your name,
[0:04] Lord. Lord, for worthy is the lamb who
[0:08] are slain, Lord Jesus. You came back and

[0:12] Jesus. And every single one of us has a
[0:14] personal walk with you, Lord. And how
[0:17] personal you are to us, Lord Jesus. That
[0:19] you reveal yourself in times of need,
[0:22] Lord. And in times of trouble, and in
[0:24] times of joy and sorrows, Lord Jesus.
[0:26] How you just come and follow hearts
[0:28] every time. Every time we're on our
[0:30] knees, Lord, think we can't go further,
[0:32] Lord. We don't know what to do, yet you
[0:34] are there with us, Lord. Lord, thank you
[0:37] that you pick us up and you heal us,
[0:39] Lord. You wipe away our tears, Lord
[0:42] Jesus. That you send a prophet in this
[0:44] end time, Lord, to help us, to guide us
[0:46] the way, to show us back to your word,
[0:48] Lord. So we know we're just not

[1:08] more are gathered in your name, Lord. We
[1:10] gather in your name, Lord. For we have
[1:12] taken your name. And we just stand for
[1:14] truth, Lord, and stand for you. We want
[1:16] to be the light in this final age, Lord.

[1:20] the world. Lord, we love you and we just

[6:35] I pray about it and on Sunday pastor Ben
[6:38] pray about this one as well and
[6:40] yesterday all the sisters pray about
[6:43] this one for that and last last Thursday
[6:48] I went to fly center and then I have to
[6:51] prepare for nine grand for actually
[6:55] tomorrow but God is so good he provide
[6:59] fly fair

[7:13] family over there. Amen.

[7:21] Amen.
[7:21] Amen.
[7:23] Praise the Lord. Thank you.
[7:25] [Applause]
[7:28] Amen.
[7:32] I just want to share a testimony and
[7:33] also prayer request. Um I told you all
[7:35] about my friend Anna um a couple of
[7:38] months ago who I told her she had cancer
[7:40] in her jaw. She she's a friend of mine
[7:41] from place to her. Rebecca's the same
[7:43] age as her daughter. She just got the
[7:45] one daughter and um she she had cancer
[7:47] in her jaw and she went through
[7:48] chemotherapy and things and I um hadn't
[7:50] been in touch with her just in the last
[7:52] month probably and I just was driving
[7:55] into the library tonight to just drop
[7:56] some books in and then she just walked
[7:58] right past my just as I was running into
[8:00] the slot and I just I know that it was
[8:03] the Lord's timing because I just said to
[8:05] her, "How are you?" And she said, "Oh, I
[8:07] just actually saw the oncologist today
[8:08] and he said, "I've only got months to
[8:09] live now."
[8:11] And so I know that in the natural it
[8:13] seems like, "Wow." But I also know that
[8:14] God had a reason. I mean, seeing you
[8:16] there today and we have the answers and
[8:20] I know Hebrews 13:8 is the same. And so
[8:22] I really believe that that was there for
[8:24] a reason.
[8:25] So I just really want to just ask if
[8:27] everyone can just pray with me that I'll
[8:28] have the right
[8:29] thing and you know like that I'll be
[8:31] able to she she the reason she was at
[8:32] the library was that she wanted to um
[8:35] find books on divine healing and because
[8:37] she said she just knows that that's her
[8:38] only hope now is God so she said she
[8:40] just needs to needs faith and so she she
[8:44] wants that so she's she's getting quite
[8:46] desperate now because she said she I've
[8:48] only given her months so you can pray
[8:50] for me and also pray for her name is
[8:51] Anna
[8:52] Amen
[9:07] I knew it. I just knew it.
[9:11] I just really feel on my heart I have to
[9:13] share this. I not a person who likes to
[9:16] come and share testimonies because yeah,
[9:18] I don't know. Anyway, the Lord has been
[9:20] so good to me and I've just been so
[9:22] blessed with what he's doing here in the
[9:23] fellowship and something's just saying
[9:24] to my heart that he's just
[9:26] his wind is really blowing again.
[9:28] Yeah.
[9:28] And I was just thinking
[9:30] I you know about we were talking about
[9:31] witnessing and things and
[9:33] the last couple of days I've just been
[9:35] so bursting and everyone I'm seeing like
[9:37] people friends that are not believers at
[9:39] all like in town and today I just felt
[9:42] led to go somewhere where I wasn't
[9:44] planning to go and there was a lady
[9:45] there and suddenly say oh you meant to
[9:46] be talking to her. I just was talking to
[9:48] her and it I didn't feel like I was
[9:49] witnessing because I'm just saying God
[9:51] is so real. Every time we step into
[9:52] church his presence is there and I'm
[9:54] just bursting with what he's doing for
[9:56] us.
[9:56] I never thought I was witnessing and I
[9:58] come home. I'm just I'll just tell Ben
[9:59] about he said that's being a real
[10:00] witness. I'm like am I witnessing
[10:02] and it's just because it's so bursting
[10:04] out of us what the Lord is doing. We
[10:06] don't need to try and be a witness. We
[10:08] don't need to try and be this. We just
[10:09] let him live and he's just bursting just
[10:12] how good he is to us. And I'm just so
[10:14] thankful and so blessed with what he's
[10:15] doing. And I just believe that it's just
[10:18] going to get greater and greater and so
[10:20] thankful to be a part of it.
[10:21] Amen.
[10:25] Amen.
[10:26] Anybody else?
[10:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[10:38] I had a we had a brother over, brother
[10:40] Chris came to visit us and he and he
[10:43] shared a bit where he says that the
[10:44] bride is the mercy seat today and and
[10:47] that sometimes we we try to pull
[10:49] ourselves out of the world because the
[10:51] world's so broken and so dark. And so he
[10:53] says, but we're the only light that's
[10:55] there. You know, without this there's no
[10:57] light.
[10:58] And so it gave me new courage to just
[11:01] walk into the light, you know, and be
[11:02] the light. And it's not not us. It's the
[11:04] Lord shining through us. But if nobody's
[11:06] prepared to go, who's going to go?
[11:08] Amen.
[11:09] You know, and the Lord will get his word
[11:11] out there even if he uses stones. He
[11:12] will get his word out there. So, I'm
[11:14] glad that we alive in this day.
[11:16] Amen.
[11:16] Where we can be that light and and the
[11:18] Lord can use us. And uh yeah, just
[11:21] praise his name. He's wonderful. Yes.
[11:23] Amen.

[27:20] Father. May you grant that for your
[27:21] glory. I pray, Lord, be those who
[27:24] couldn't be here tonight. Be their
[27:25] portion.
[27:26] Father, be their strength. be their
[27:27] shield, oh God. Be their all and all. I
[27:29] pray. And Father, we just want to lift
[27:31] Anna into your presence by prayer.
[27:33] Father, the doctors have turned her
[27:35] down, but Lord, you never turn anyone
[27:36] down.
[27:37] Father, you're the great physician.
[27:39] Lord, we just lift her up, oh God.
[27:41] Father, we pray you'd go her way, Lord
[27:43] Jesus. Lord, this is her time.
[27:45] Father, I pray that you you'd go and
[27:48] speak to her, Lord Jesus. You're a
[27:49] supernatural God. Lord, she's going from
[27:52] church to church, place to place, trying
[27:54] to find the answer.
[27:56] And Lord, we have you. We have the
[27:58] answer.
[27:59] Amen.
[28:00] Lord, may she come to the fountain and
[28:01] drink. I pray. And Father, may Lord, we
[28:04] know by your stripes, Anna was healed.
[28:06] Lord, I pray faith would raise in her
[28:08] heart just to rest in that reality that
[28:09] by your stripes, Lord, she's healed.
[28:12] Lord, I just pray you' just drive that
[28:14] cancer devil out of her in the name of
[28:15] Jesus Christ, Father, and restore her. I
[28:18] pray. And Father, not just her body, but
[28:20] her soul as well, dear God. May you
[28:22] grant it for your glory, Lord. We commit
[28:24] her into your hands and Lord we love you
[28:27] Lord with everything that's in us Lord
[28:28] you're worthy and wonderful to us Lord
[28:31] Father may you just be glorified now
[28:32] Lord anoint speaker and hear one more
[28:34] time
[28:35] and Father if you want to rapture us now
[28:37] Lord we would love that Lord Jesus
[28:39] father we're looking for your Lord a
[28:40] change in these bodies we thank you in
[28:42] Jesus Christ's name amen
[28:45] amen thank you musicians thank you
[28:46] brother Arand amen praise the Lord amen
[28:50] if you got your Bibles handy
[28:53] I'd like to go to Proverbs chapter 18.
[29:00] And I know I said it last Wednesday, but
[29:01] I'll say it again. The Sunday morning
[29:04] musicians, they're on notice.
[29:07] Amen. No, it's wonderful to see gifts
[29:08] develop. Praise the Lord.
[29:10] Amen. Thank the Lord for answered
[29:12] prayer, too.
[29:14] Praise the Lord.
[29:16] Amen. Proverbs 18
[29:21] and we're going to read verse 21 and
[29:23] then we're going to go to 2 Corinthians
[29:25] chapter 11. I believe it is. I'll make
[29:27] sure that when we
[29:31] No, sorry. 2 Corinthians chapter 4. Now,
[29:34] I want to kind of continue on from
[29:35] Sunday.
[29:38] It's a very important if you can if you
[29:40] can grasp this,
[29:42] I believe it'll change a lot of things.
[29:43] Amen.
[29:44] It's very simple though, but God is
[29:46] simple. Now it says death and life. This
[29:49] is Proverbs 18:21. Death and life are in
[29:52] the power of the tongue. They that love
[29:54] it shall eat the fruit thereof.
[29:57] We'll go to 2 Corinthians chapter 4.
[29:59] Amen. Death and life is in the power of
[30:02] the tongue.
[30:06] 2 Corinthians chapter 4.
[30:17] And let's read from verse eight.
[30:22] Says, "We are troubled on every side yet
[30:24] not distressed. We are perplexed but not
[30:27] in despair, persecuted but not forsaken,
[30:30] cast down but not destroyed, always
[30:32] bearing about in the body the dying of
[30:34] the Lord Jesus, that the life also of
[30:36] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[30:37] body. For we which live are always
[30:40] delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
[30:41] that the life also of Jesus may be made
[30:44] manifest in our mortal flesh.
[30:47] Amen.
[30:47] Amen. Now, I want let's just read that
[30:49] verse one more time, but instead of we
[30:51] say I, and instead of say my.
[30:55] Okay? For I wait, this probably not
[30:58] correct. Anyway, for I I I that live is
[31:01] always delivered uh unto death for
[31:04] Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus
[31:06] might be manifested in my mortal flesh.
[31:09] You got to make it personal now.
[31:11] Amen. Having so then death workketh in
[31:15] us, but life in you. We have the same
[31:17] spirit of faith according as is written,
[31:20] I believed, and therefore I have spoken.
[31:23] Amen. We also believe and therefore
[31:25] speak knowing that he which raised up
[31:28] the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by
[31:31] Jesus and shall present us with you.
[31:34] Amen.
[31:34] For all things are for your sakes that
[31:36] the abundant grace might be uh might
[31:39] through the f thanksgiving of many
[31:41] rebound to the glory of God.
[31:43] Amen.
[31:44] For which cause we faint not. For though
[31:46] an outward man perish, yet the inward
[31:48] man is renewed day by day.
[31:50] Amen. For our light affliction, which is
[31:51] for but a moment workketh for us, a far
[31:54] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[31:56] glory.
[31:58] While we look not at the things which
[32:00] are seen, but at the things which are
[32:02] not seen, for the things which are seen
[32:04] are temporal, but the things which are
[32:06] not seen are eternal. Amen. May Lord
[32:09] bless his word. You may be seated.
[32:12] Now, it's incredible. We you know I just
[32:15] want to talk about life and death is in
[32:17] the power of the tongue and we see that
[32:21] there's a through the ages God is God
[32:24] has been revealing himself and he's been
[32:27] making himself known in such a way that
[32:29] he but he but he wants you he wants the
[32:31] believer to respond to him.
[32:33] Amen.
[32:33] Amen. It's it's it's not just to sit and
[32:36] and maybe hear, you know, you can go on
[32:38] the internet and you can hear incredible
[32:39] sermons and you know, you can hear
[32:41] incredible ministry and, you know, we're
[32:43] so blessed. We can we can sit there and
[32:45] we can listen to the message of the hour
[32:47] and we can see God display himself like
[32:48] he never has and you know, we can come
[32:51] to church and have a wonderful time in
[32:53] church, but we understand it it doesn't
[32:55] just stop there.
[32:56] Amen. But there's a responsibility that
[32:58] we have to speak the word.
[33:01] Amen. There's a there cuz there has to
[33:03] be a response because as the word goes
[33:05] to you, it it creates a faith in your
[33:08] heart, but then you've got to speak it
[33:09] out.
[33:10] Amen. It's not for someone else. Maybe
[33:12] if you need prayer, it's good to get
[33:14] prayed for, but you need to talk.
[33:15] Amen.
[33:16] Amen. You need to speak.
[33:17] You need to address your enemy yourself
[33:19] as well. Amen. We're all brothers and
[33:21] sisters in the same battle, but really
[33:23] at the end of the day, it's you that has
[33:25] to go toe-to-toe with the enemy. It's
[33:27] you that has to look him square in the
[33:28] face and say, "Devil, you're a bluff.
[33:30] You were stripped at Calvary. You're as
[33:32] defeated now as you were back then. And
[33:34] you've got to call his hand.
[33:36] Amen. You've got to call his hand cuz we
[33:38] we got to recognize our enemy is
[33:40] defeated.
[33:41] He doesn't have a weapon. When he went
[33:42] riding forth in the first age, he had a
[33:44] bow and no arrows. What good is a bow
[33:46] with any arrows? You know, you need
[33:48] arrows unless it's just something like
[33:50] it's just basically a stick.
[33:52] Amen. Not even a very strong stick.
[33:53] That's all he had. He was a bluff.
[33:55] Amen. And he's still the same bluff
[33:57] today. Amen.
[33:58] But
[33:58] so we have to recognize him as a bluff
[34:00] and stand on the word that's been given
[34:02] to us and we have to speak to him.
[34:05] Amen.
[34:06] Amen.
[34:06] Now
[34:08] I'm just I'm just going to read verse 17
[34:10] again because if we could just
[34:11] understand for our light affliction
[34:14] which is but for a moment workketh for
[34:17] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[34:19] weight of glory. We just recognize the
[34:22] little things you know you know
[34:25] the things we go through in life. They
[34:27] are but just a light affliction. When
[34:29] you really keep everything, you got to
[34:30] keep everything in in in perspective.
[34:33] Soon and very soon, we're going to see
[34:35] the king.
[34:36] Soon and very soon, our enemy and
[34:37] everything we've been wrestling against
[34:38] is going to be reduced to not even
[34:40] ashes. It's going to be destroyed. And
[34:42] soon and very soon, it's not even going
[34:44] to be a memory.
[34:44] Amen.
[34:45] Amen.
[34:45] You'd always keep that before you.
[34:47] Amen. Remember, we look to the unseen
[34:50] things.
[34:50] That's right.
[34:51] Because the seen things are temporal.
[34:53] That's right.
[34:53] Amen. They're not eternal things. We
[34:55] must look to the eternal things. Amen.
[34:57] So, it's just but everything we go
[34:59] through in life. And Paul knew what he
[35:01] was talking about. He had been
[35:02] shipwrecked. He had been beaten. He had
[35:05] been thrown in prison. You know, he had
[35:07] been robbed. He had been he had been
[35:09] hungry. He had been cold. He had
[35:10] suffered many things. But he just puts
[35:12] it down. It's just a light affliction.
[35:15] Amen. He had he had been through some
[35:17] hardship in his life. But when he was
[35:18] weighing it all up with the eternal
[35:20] things and the temporal things, it's
[35:21] just it's just but a light affliction.
[35:23] Amen.
[35:25] Now God God through the ages
[35:29] we must understand
[35:31] God does not call he does not call the
[35:34] qualified. He does not call the ones
[35:37] that man thinks he should call. Amen.
[35:40] You think of the, you know, you think,
[35:42] you know, man's idea of if if if if we
[35:45] were picking the 120 in the upper room
[35:47] and if we were picking the man that
[35:49] would have the keys to the kingdom, you
[35:51] know, man would man would have a school
[35:53] and they would they would they would
[35:54] have a lot of classes and then they'd
[35:56] have some exams and not only would they
[35:58] have some exams, but because
[35:59] Christianity is a moral thing, they
[36:01] would look at his life and they'd look
[36:02] at his parents' life and his
[36:04] grandparents' life and they would look
[36:06] at the tribe he came from and, you know,
[36:08] they would they would look at what he
[36:09] looked like And you know they would you
[36:11] know just how man judges someone by the
[36:13] outward appearance and how smart they
[36:15] are and you know that's how that's how
[36:17] Peter would have been picked if if if
[36:19] man had an idea you hey are you
[36:21] following me? You know but God doesn't
[36:24] God doesn't call people that way. God
[36:26] does not use those kind of people
[36:27] necessarily. He calls people that will
[36:30] believe him. Amen. And he doesn't, you
[36:34] know, the high priest, the priests and
[36:36] the scribes and Pharisees,
[36:39] they had to live a spotless life. If
[36:41] they did not, they would have been
[36:42] stoned without mercy. Yeah. God didn't
[36:46] call any of those people. You
[36:48] understand? God didn't use any of them.
[36:50] He bypassed all of those schools and all
[36:52] that understanding and all those, you
[36:54] know, devout people and he bypassed all
[36:57] of them and he took fishermanmen
[36:59] and he took the woman at the well
[37:01] and he took a tax collector and he took
[37:03] prostitutes and he took drunkards. He
[37:06] took demon-possessed people and they
[37:08] were the ones that he called.
[37:10] That's right.
[37:10] Hallelujah. So, I just I just want to
[37:13] can I just kick that to touch for a
[37:14] little bit? Amen. It doesn't matter what
[37:17] we think we are. That's irrelevant. If
[37:19] there's faith, if something has caused
[37:21] you to believe this word,
[37:23] Amen. You just got to recognize God's
[37:25] called you.
[37:26] Amen.
[37:26] Amen. God's God's made you worthy.
[37:28] Amen.
[37:29] Hallelujah. God has chosen you. You
[37:31] know, we never sit we don't have a have
[37:33] to sit a single exam to go to heaven.
[37:36] That's right.
[37:36] Amen. There's nothing weak. All we can
[37:38] do is believe his word. And then when
[37:40] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[37:42] word of God, then that faith transformed
[37:44] us transforms us into what we're meant
[37:46] to be.
[37:46] Amen.
[37:47] Hallelujah.
[37:49] Now, God God down through from from from
[37:52] from Abel from Abel all the way down
[37:55] through he's have had a living witness
[37:57] upon the earth and he's manifested
[38:00] himself in that living witness. Yep. So
[38:03] God was in Abel. Amen. And he was he was
[38:08] he was living out something in Abel. God
[38:10] came and spoke to Noah and Noah was a
[38:12] living witness to that generation. And
[38:14] before that, Enoch was a living witness
[38:16] to that generation. And then there was
[38:18] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
[38:20] prophets, and Moses, and all the
[38:21] different ones, King David, and all the
[38:23] way down, God had a living witness
[38:26] because his word must be, you know, it
[38:28] says here,
[38:30] it says, "For we which live all way
[38:32] delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
[38:35] that the life also of Jesus might be
[38:37] made manifest in our mortal flesh." So
[38:39] there, all the prophets down through,
[38:41] God would step into them, and he would
[38:43] live himself out. So the life of God was
[38:46] manifested in their flesh. Amen. You say
[38:48] that's very elementary. Well, it is. But
[38:52] we, you know, and then and then we come
[38:54] to the New Testament and there was John
[38:55] the Baptist and God was reflecting
[38:57] himself through John the Baptist and
[38:58] then the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[39:00] came into you know you know was in
[39:02] Christ and then so that so now the life
[39:04] of God all that God was was poured into
[39:06] one man.
[39:08] Amen. But then but then that one man who
[39:10] was a god man he be to gather you know
[39:14] the very creator of heavens and earth
[39:15] stepped into a body you know that was
[39:17] god and flesh the word became flesh and
[39:19] he begin to gather his disciples and the
[39:21] purpose of him gathering his disciples
[39:23] is Jesus knew he'd only lived to what
[39:25] about 33.
[39:27] Amen. He knew his ministry his earthly
[39:30] ministry in that way was going to change
[39:32] from from from the redeemer. Now he's
[39:34] going to go empty himself into his
[39:36] church and the work was going to
[39:37] manifest on. So that when when the
[39:40] disciples were being called, Amen. When
[39:43] the disciple I you know I trust I trust
[39:44] you're following me. When the disciples
[39:46] were being called, God was calling
[39:48] vessels to dwell in. Amen. God was d
[39:52] gathering people that he was going to
[39:53] dwell in and live his life out of them.
[39:55] And then we have the day of Pentecost
[39:57] where the pillar of fire came in and
[39:58] separated itself out into 120 people.
[40:01] where once it was just in one, now it's
[40:03] in 120. And then there's a man standing,
[40:06] a redeemed man. And he has the keys to
[40:08] the kingdom. He has the ability to to
[40:11] because the key opens the door. We
[40:13] understand. So Peter was given the keys
[40:15] to open the door so people could come
[40:17] into the kingdom of God. He's a redeemed
[40:19] man with that kind of responsibility.
[40:22] And he began to stand up on the day of
[40:24] Pentecost. And it wasn't him speaking.
[40:26] It was now that same Jesus whom they
[40:28] whom they crucified was now in a person.
[40:31] Amen.
[40:31] In 120 people and that same Jesus was
[40:34] now speaking, amen, out of Peter.
[40:38] And then as he was preaching, they said,
[40:39] "What must we do to be saved?" He says,
[40:41] "Repent and be baptized name of Jesus
[40:43] Christ, every one of you, for remission
[40:45] of sin, and you shall receive the gift
[40:46] of the Holy Ghost." And this promises to
[40:48] you and to your children, those that are
[40:51] far off, as many as our Lord God shall
[40:53] call. So the promise was that if you did
[40:56] this, God would first you have to be
[40:57] pricked in the heart where but if you
[40:59] did this instruction then the same God
[41:02] that was there in Jesus as now in the
[41:04] apostles would come and dwell in you.
[41:06] Amen.
[41:06] Hallelujah. And then now then now the
[41:10] people the people that God would come
[41:12] and dwell in, they begin to be a living
[41:14] witness to the age that they're alive
[41:16] in. Amen. Where it's not them doing the
[41:18] works anymore, but it's but it's the
[41:21] father. It's God that dwells in him. He
[41:23] does the works. He lives the life.
[41:25] Amen.
[41:26] Amen. And so that's why so every
[41:28] generation has been this way that God
[41:32] God through the church ages, even
[41:33] through the church ages, through the
[41:34] dark ages, through the reformation, it's
[41:36] been God in measure has been poured out.
[41:39] But then in the last days now, the
[41:41] fullness of God again, the son of man
[41:43] was revealed. And now all that God is,
[41:46] you know, you know, brother makes a
[41:47] statement. All that God was, he poured
[41:50] himself into Christ. And then all Christ
[41:53] is, he poured himself into the church.
[41:57] Amen. See everything God is now was
[42:00] poured into the church. That's you.
[42:04] Amen. Are you following me? I trust I
[42:06] trust you know you recognize and maybe
[42:08] if you I trust this does not sound
[42:10] redundant, but you got to recognize God
[42:13] dwells in me.
[42:15] Amen. that you and however you live and
[42:17] however you do things,
[42:20] the life of Jesus is manifested in your
[42:23] mortal flesh.
[42:25] Amen. You got to recognize this that I'm
[42:28] not just a church person. I'm not just a
[42:29] religious person. I'm not just trying
[42:31] to, you know, live this kind of life.
[42:33] But when when you meet him, then the
[42:36] life of God is manifested in your mortal
[42:38] flesh.
[42:40] Amen. It said, yeah, it says in John, I
[42:43] can't remember where the scriptures off
[42:44] top of my head, but it says that it says
[42:46] that everyone, the spirit of antichrist
[42:49] will will never recognize that Christ
[42:52] has come in flesh, not has come because
[42:56] all the relig all the Christian
[42:58] denominations of the world say Jesus was
[43:00] born and died and
[43:03] that was him in flesh. Absolutely. But
[43:04] when it comes to has he is he presently
[43:07] come in in flesh, that's a whole
[43:09] different thing.
[43:11] You understand?
[43:13] And so you've got to recognize now,
[43:16] remember, God's God God needs hands. God
[43:21] needs feet. God needs voices. God needs
[43:24] bodies. And he and and he's picked you
[43:28] just like he picked Peter, James, and
[43:29] John that were illiterate fishermen.
[43:31] Just like the woman at the well, just
[43:33] like all those down and out people that
[43:35] you would never think would qualify to
[43:37] be one of the redeemed. You know, God is
[43:39] remember Jesus Christ the same
[43:42] yesterday, today, and forever.
[43:44] You recognize that? So, if God doesn't
[43:46] change, then the people he uses doesn't
[43:49] change.
[43:50] You understand? David was a was a
[43:52] shepherd boy. He became the king.
[43:55] Amen. Moses was a runaway, you know,
[43:58] prophet on the back side of the desert.
[43:59] You know, all these kind of people, you
[44:02] think they either were not qualified or
[44:04] they disqualified themselves
[44:06] because Moses tried, but he failed. And
[44:08] you think, well, that'd be it. But God
[44:10] didn't change his mind about Moses. He
[44:12] just had to get Moses out of Moses. Then
[44:14] he could use him. Just like us many
[44:16] times, he's got to get you out of
[44:18] yourself and then he can step in and
[44:20] shake the world with you.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:22] Hallelujah. And so God God picks those
[44:26] kind of people. Amen. And if he did it
[44:28] in the beginning of the church, he's
[44:29] going to do it at the end. And he has.
[44:32] I'm so glad I'm in that number.
[44:35] Hallelujah.
[44:36] Amen. So, we got to recognize that there
[44:40] has to be a living witness upon the
[44:41] earth. Amen. There has to be a living
[44:44] witness in every generation. There's a
[44:46] living witness because the life of God
[44:48] has to be manifested in a people. And
[44:50] it's the same thing the word. That's why
[44:52] we can't just leave the preaching on on
[44:55] on the tapes. That same word, that same
[44:58] anointing has to come into a ministry
[45:00] and be preached out. And that same word,
[45:02] that same anointing has to come into a
[45:04] people and be lived out.
[45:05] Amen.
[45:06] Amen. And so life and death is in the
[45:08] power of the tongue. Now it says here
[45:11] that we believe, therefore we speak.
[45:15] We can find that. Yes. Having the same
[45:18] spirit of faith according is written. I
[45:21] believed and therefore I I have spoken.
[45:24] We believe and therefore we speak.
[45:26] Therefore, speak. So, there's an action.
[45:28] There's an action that goes Abraham. You
[45:31] can go from Abraham, and I'm probably,
[45:33] forgive me if I'm trying to condense, or
[45:34] I'm just trying to get you to catch
[45:37] something here. Abraham believed God,
[45:39] and it was counted to him for
[45:41] righteousness,
[45:42] did he not? So, God said, "I'm going to
[45:44] make your seed as the sand of the sea
[45:47] and the stars in the sky." And and and
[45:49] he believed them.
[45:50] So, there was a response from Abraham
[45:52] that went back to God.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:54] Amen. And God said to Abraham, "I have
[45:57] made you, father of nations." Not, "I
[45:59] will make you. I have made you."
[46:01] Amen. Amen.
[46:01] Amen. I have made you. That's a big
[46:03] difference. And we are the children of
[46:06] Abraham according to the faith. Amen.
[46:08] So, it's actually in reality and and
[46:11] well, if this is too strong, it's just
[46:12] it is what it is. It's not I will make
[46:14] you the bride of Christ. I have made you
[46:16] the bride of Christ.
[46:18] Amen. You've just got to step into what
[46:20] God has made you.
[46:22] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why the
[46:25] scripture would tell us when we would go
[46:26] to Isaiah
[46:28] and let's go to Isaiah chapter um I
[46:31] think 57. Forgive me. I just wanted
[46:33] because Yeah. No, Isaiah 54 verse 17 cuz
[46:39] we're in a battle friends. We've been
[46:41] fighting some things as well. But I just
[46:44] trust this this this anchors down a
[46:47] little bit on this left hand side.
[46:51] He says this, "No weapon,"
[46:54] Amen.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:55] This is thus sayith the word of God. "No
[46:57] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[46:59] prosper."
[47:00] Amen.
[47:00] "And every tongue that shall rise
[47:02] against thee in judgment thou shalt
[47:04] condemn." This is the heritage of the
[47:06] servants of the Lord, and their
[47:07] righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
[47:10] Amen. So no weapon, repeat after me, no
[47:13] weapon formed against me shall prosper,
[47:16] and every tongue that shall rise against
[47:18] thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.
[47:20] Amen. So there's life and death in your
[47:22] tongue. Amen. Do you agree with the
[47:24] accuser or do you deny the accuser?
[47:27] Amen. It's like this, you know,
[47:29] brother's there and and you hear it in
[47:31] brother Biscll's testimony. It's you
[47:33] it's also on tape up in Dorson Creek.
[47:36] They're at the end of a service and
[47:37] they're singing. I think I love him. I
[47:39] love him. And brother Bram, you you hear
[47:41] him on tape and apparently he just he
[47:43] just cries out, you won't commit
[47:45] suicide. Told your boy that's the devil
[47:47] talking to you. deny him and go home and
[47:50] you'll be a real gentleman. I meant
[47:52] you'll be a real husband or whatever,
[47:53] you know. But he just said deny him.
[47:56] Yeah. Now, I don't believe he denied him
[47:59] at that point because a few days later
[48:02] when they're traveling up to go hunting,
[48:05] uh, you know, a guy has that same
[48:07] soldier boy and they meet in the middle
[48:09] of nowhere in this little town and
[48:11] brother Barham, the Lord reveals what
[48:13] that soldier boy had been doing and he
[48:15] was delivered.
[48:16] Amen. But I believe if the soldier boy
[48:19] denied the enemy in that atmosphere,
[48:21] Amen.
[48:22] Amen. Then then he would have been
[48:24] delivered.
[48:25] You see, life and death is in the power
[48:27] of the tongue.
[48:29] You understand? God was God was giving
[48:31] an invitation to that soldier boy, but
[48:33] now he had to respond.
[48:35] Amen. And many times we may not feel it
[48:38] on the inside, but when you begin to
[48:40] speak it, then God comes and meets what
[48:42] you're saying and faith rises and then
[48:44] you're delivered.
[48:45] Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:47] That's right.
[48:47] Oh, I've got to feel full of faith. No,
[48:49] just just you have a mustard seed of
[48:52] faith. Doesn't matter what you feel,
[48:54] just speak it across the lips.
[48:56] Amen. If God is calling you to do a
[48:58] certain thing, just like just deny him,
[49:01] soldier boy, just deny him. If he did, I
[49:04] believe he would have been free.
[49:06] Amen.
[49:08] So, it's simple. Do you agree with the
[49:10] Do you agree with the accuser or do you
[49:13] do you condemn him?
[49:16] Amen. Remember, life and death is in the
[49:18] power of the tongue. When he comes
[49:19] along, says, "You're not good enough.
[49:20] You're not a witness. You think you're
[49:21] the bride. You think you'll go in the
[49:23] rapture." Do you agree and say, "Well,
[49:25] you know, I don't think I'm very good
[49:26] and this is what's happening." Don't
[49:28] agree with him.
[49:30] Condemn him.
[49:31] Amen. Because that is a weapon. That is
[49:34] part of the weapons that are formed
[49:36] against thee. And you got to remember
[49:37] when the enemy because the enemy I was
[49:39] thinking about this and
[49:42] you know this life against the devil
[49:45] it's like a big game of whack-a-ole.
[49:50] That's the only way I can think of it.
[49:51] Sorry, I'm not meaning a joke. But he
[49:53] rises up, you take the word, you smash
[49:56] him in the head. Then he rises up, you
[49:58] take the word, you smash him in the
[49:59] head. He rises up, you take the word,
[50:01] you smash him in the head. Amen. Now
[50:05] remember,
[50:08] we can't just give up.
[50:10] It's either walk with the Lord or you
[50:13] might as well say, "Chain me up as a
[50:15] slave, Satan." There's no middle ground.
[50:18] Amen. You're either walking free or
[50:20] you'll going back into captivity.
[50:22] What are you going to yield to? I say
[50:24] there's no turning back.
[50:27] Amen. Oh, the devil's on my case. Of
[50:30] course, he'd be on your case. He's
[50:31] terrified. I remember he's a bluff.
[50:34] He just, you know, you know, you know,
[50:35] he just, you know, he studies you
[50:38] and he studies you and he's waiting and
[50:41] he's looking and then finally he's got
[50:43] that punch and then and he he may he he
[50:47] may try in all different ways cuz he's
[50:50] studying you.
[50:52] But then when you say, "I'm just tired.
[50:53] I just can't do this anymore."
[50:55] Then he's got you.
[50:57] That's right.
[50:58] You understand? He tries to weigh you
[50:59] down.
[51:01] How do you get unworn down?
[51:03] Pray.
[51:04] Maybe you just need a good night's
[51:06] sleep, but prayer is a good thing.
[51:08] Not out of this top two inches, but out
[51:10] of here.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:12] Amen. And then find God come upon the
[51:14] scene and whatever you've been battling
[51:16] against, it won't seem so big anymore.
[51:18] That's right.
[51:20] You with me?
[51:22] Amen. He's like a greasy I I don't know
[51:25] the words, but you know, that's what he
[51:27] does. He He raises his head. and he
[51:29] raises his head. You know, I heard Donny
[51:33] Reagan say this today and I think it was
[51:34] quite true. You think the devil, he
[51:38] believes this Bible?
[51:40] He fights it with all that are within
[51:42] him.
[51:43] He reads the end of the book where he is
[51:45] going to be cast into a lake of fire. Do
[51:48] you think he's discouraged?
[51:50] He doesn't. He's not discouraged. He
[51:53] fights. He comes to every service. He's
[51:55] there at every prayer meeting. He's
[51:57] there where you are contending with you
[52:00] and he gets driven out. He gets stomped
[52:02] on. He gets he gets pulled through the
[52:04] shredder. He gets beaten. He gets kicked
[52:06] out all all which way. But he's there
[52:09] again. He's the first one back in line.
[52:13] He is He is
[52:17] a little human. He would be the most
[52:19] person there is. But he
[52:23] always
[52:32] think this going to work out.
[52:36] We got to look the other way around.
[52:46] No weapon formed against you shall
[52:48] prosper.
[52:49] Discouragement He tries to split your
[52:52] family up. He tries to take your
[52:53] children away. He tries to make you
[52:55] poor. He tries to take your house.
[52:57] Whatever he may try to do, no weapon,
[53:00] amen, that is formed against you shall
[53:02] prosper. You got to remember that.
[53:06] Hallelujah.
[53:08] Amen. But life and death is in the power
[53:09] of the tongue.
[53:12] You know
[53:14] Jesus would have a meeting with his
[53:15] disciples
[53:17] and he was looking for a response from
[53:19] them. And he said, he said, "Who do men
[53:21] say that I am?" And they said, "Well,
[53:23] you're, you know, they say you're
[53:25] Jeremiah or Elijah or one of the
[53:27] prophets." But he he began to ask them,
[53:29] "But who do you say I am?" Amen. Who do
[53:32] you say I am? And who's looking to see
[53:34] if they had, you know, he was looking to
[53:37] see what they had caught, you know, what
[53:40] they had seen. They had seen miracles.
[53:42] They had seen people raised from the
[53:44] dead. They had seen the bread and the
[53:45] loaves being multiplied, you know, the
[53:47] bread and the fishes. They had seen
[53:48] incredible things but he was he was
[53:51] looking but who do you say I am?
[53:55] And the same question remember Peter
[53:57] said thou art the Christ the son of the
[53:59] living God. And Jesus said blessed art
[54:02] thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood
[54:04] has not revealed this to you but my
[54:05] father which is in heaven and upon this
[54:07] rock I'll build my church
[54:09] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[54:11] against it. Amen. So the revelation of
[54:13] who he is is the rock that we're built
[54:16] upon.
[54:18] Amen. And the same question is posed to
[54:21] you.
[54:22] Who do you say this is?
[54:25] Amen. Remember
[54:28] the spirit of God has to be manifested
[54:30] in your mortal flesh. Amen. Who do you
[54:33] say this is? Now, I'm just not talking
[54:36] about, you know, the message. Well, you
[54:38] I'll pose that question. Who do you say
[54:40] brother Brandham is? Is it a healing
[54:42] ministry? Is it just a kind of amazing
[54:44] kind of ministry? Or is it Jesus Christ
[54:47] the same yesterday, today, and forever?
[54:49] Is it is it God himself speaking through
[54:51] that man? Amen. And then now when you
[54:55] meet the Lord, you or you know, I'm just
[54:58] going to throw it purely on you. When
[55:00] you meet God and you see him begin to do
[55:03] things, you should ask the question, who
[55:05] do you say? Who do you believe it is? Is
[55:09] it your own ability? Is it your own
[55:11] humanity? Or is it God?
[55:14] Amen. Because if you can, you know, if
[55:18] it if it sinks down into your soul, that
[55:20] that that the one that's keeping you is
[55:22] not yourself. The one that's keeping you
[55:25] on this walk is not your own ambition or
[55:27] what you try and set out to do, but it's
[55:29] God himself keeping you on the way. You
[55:31] say, "It Lord, it's you doing this.
[55:34] It's not me that doeth the works as my
[55:35] father dwelleth in me." That's what
[55:37] Jesus said. And we can say the same
[55:39] thing cuz that same God was in him is
[55:41] now on the bride.
[55:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're a living.
[55:45] The bride is a living witness in this
[55:47] end time.
[55:48] Amen. And I can trust you can say, "I'm
[55:51] in that number."
[55:52] Amen.
[55:52] I'm one of them.
[55:54] Hallelujah. Now, life and death is in
[55:56] the power of the tongue. I know I keep
[55:59] repeating that, but I want you to
[56:00] understand.
[56:01] Now, when when brother Brandham spoke
[56:04] about the third pull,
[56:07] does anyone know what the third pull is?
[56:10] No. Does anyone know what the third pole
[56:12] is?
[56:14] Yeah. If not, does anyone not know?
[56:18] You you not sure?
[56:21] Huh?
[56:23] Okay. Okay. So, the third pull. Now,
[56:25] Jesus had three phases of his ministry
[56:28] and so did brother Brandham and they
[56:30] called pulls. It's what the angel
[56:33] related to him. The first one was was so
[56:35] in brother Bram's case it was taking
[56:37] people by the hand and when he did he
[56:39] could there was various lumps and things
[56:42] formed on his hand and he knew what the
[56:43] diseases were in the people and he could
[56:45] pray for them and they were healed and
[56:47] that attracted thousands and tens of
[56:49] thousands of people. Then the next phase
[56:51] of the ministry was after that the angel
[56:53] told him that if you're sincere that
[56:56] they'll come to a place you'll know the
[56:57] very secrets of the people's hearts. So
[57:00] it moved from just taking them by the
[57:02] hand that when now the angel of the Lord
[57:04] would be there and then he'd see visions
[57:06] and know everything about the person
[57:07] standing in front of him or people out
[57:09] in the audience that were praying and
[57:11] then now but the third phase of the
[57:13] ministry was now this word opening up
[57:16] which is the opening of the seals.
[57:18] Amen.
[57:18] Yeah. Which is the opening of this. Now
[57:20] the but the third pull is more than just
[57:22] understanding doctrine but it's what it
[57:25] is. It's the creative power of God
[57:28] coming into a people.
[57:31] Okay, this is part remember it's the
[57:32] opening of the word. It's a few things,
[57:34] but it's the opening of the word, but
[57:35] it's also I well, this is just my
[57:38] terminology, the creative power of God
[57:40] coming into a people because you can see
[57:43] it in brother Bram's life. There were
[57:44] five instances when the where the third
[57:46] pull was manifested.
[57:48] One was they were fishing and a fish
[57:51] little fish bit onto a two bigger hook
[57:54] and and one of the brothers with him
[57:56] pulled the hook out and it pulled all
[57:57] the inards out of the fish and then the
[57:59] brother said well you shot your last one
[58:00] little fishy and threw him out on the
[58:02] water and then about a half an hour
[58:03] later the spirit of God came down
[58:05] brother stood up and he says little
[58:07] fishy I give you back your life in the
[58:08] name of Jesus Christ the guts went into
[58:10] the fish and it jumped out and it swam
[58:11] away totally alive. Then the and then
[58:14] there was another instance where the
[58:16] where there's a tumor the size of a
[58:18] grapefruit.
[58:20] Well, it it got that big. It it it went
[58:22] into, you know, in his wife. Yeah. And
[58:26] it got as big as a grapefruit. And then
[58:28] he was praying and they've been praying
[58:30] for a while about it. And he was praying
[58:32] and then the spirit of God came upon him
[58:33] and says, "Ask what you will." And he
[58:35] says, "When the surgeon goes to operate,
[58:37] may it disappear." And that's exactly
[58:39] what happened. And then he was in the
[58:42] storm in Colorado and and and the
[58:45] blizzard came down and they all started
[58:47] to go back to camp. But then brother
[58:49] Brown was going back to camp and he
[58:50] heard a voice speak to him out of the
[58:51] storm saying, "I'm the God of creation,
[58:54] you know, will you walk with me?" And
[58:56] then he and he actually turned around
[58:58] and went back up into the storm. And
[59:00] then God asked him and and he couldn't
[59:02] see because it's just a blizzard. And
[59:04] then he was asked and then God said,
[59:05] "What what do you need?"
[59:08] He says, "Well, I mean, you speak and it
[59:11] shall be." He says, "I want to admit,
[59:13] you know, I want the storm to go away.
[59:15] Four days, I think it was of of of blue
[59:18] sky cuz we're going to finish our hunt."
[59:21] And it happened exactly that way. Yeah.
[59:24] So, the So, the full-on blizzard and it
[59:26] just went away. A perfect blue sky. And
[59:29] then the next one was had he right now,
[59:32] they were No, I should probably
[59:34] backtrack. He's hunting and he's hunting
[59:36] squirrels and he's hunting in a place
[59:38] where squirrels because squirrels only
[59:40] go to certain trees and he's in this
[59:42] place and in this and in that and then
[59:44] God spoke to him and says what do you
[59:45] need? Says well I'm hunting some
[59:48] squirrels. Well, how many do you want?
[59:50] He says I don't know four or five I
[59:52] can't remember the number. And then so
[59:54] he says and then and then he and then
[59:57] brother says let let a squirrel appear
[59:59] here and go over here on this branch.
[1:00:00] And he shot it and he's shocked cuz
[1:00:02] there wasn't a squirrel there before.
[1:00:03] And then he keeps saying about other
[1:00:05] ones to appear. And he said, "Let one
[1:00:06] appear in a tree that they never in.
[1:00:08] Come down this branch, go here, here,
[1:00:09] stop here, and I'll shoot it." Happened
[1:00:10] exactly that way. And then now, Brother
[1:00:13] Baron's relating this back in a back in
[1:00:16] a farm of a very poor family. Remember,
[1:00:19] God God doesn't come to the wealthy and
[1:00:21] the famous necessarily. He comes to the
[1:00:23] poor. The gospel preached to the poor.
[1:00:26] And and this is the right family. And
[1:00:28] he's relating when he shot the
[1:00:29] squirrels. And she's sitting there.
[1:00:32] Remember, life and death is in the power
[1:00:33] of the tongue. She's sitting there.
[1:00:36] She's got a crippled sister in a
[1:00:37] wheelchair. Amen. She's got old old uh
[1:00:41] mom and dad sitting there. And she's got
[1:00:43] two sons who are teenagers who are not
[1:00:45] really interested in the Lord at all.
[1:00:47] And so he's relating this and she just
[1:00:49] says there's nothing but that's nothing
[1:00:51] but the truth, brother Brandham, about
[1:00:52] the squirrels being created. Then now
[1:00:54] that same power came down and brother
[1:00:57] Bram said to her, "Ask what you will and
[1:01:00] if it doesn't happen, you can call me a
[1:01:02] false prophet. Do you want a million
[1:01:04] dollars? It'll fall on your lap. Do you
[1:01:06] want your sister to come out of the
[1:01:07] wheelchair? She'll come out of the
[1:01:08] wheelchair. Ask what you will." And she
[1:01:11] said, "I want the salvation of my two
[1:01:12] boys."
[1:01:12] Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] And and the Lord says, you know, and
[1:01:15] then brother says, "I give them to you
[1:01:17] name Lord Jesus Christ." and and and
[1:01:19] they were laughing and playing and they
[1:01:21] fell on their mother's lap crying and
[1:01:22] they gave themselves to the Lord and
[1:01:23] they're Christians ever since.
[1:01:25] Yeah,
[1:01:27] I think that's five. I'm not sure.
[1:01:29] Okay. So, that is the five
[1:01:31] manifestations of the third Paul. You
[1:01:34] understand? So, now brother Bram says
[1:01:37] now he says he says what is manifested
[1:01:42] kind of temporarily
[1:01:44] will come into its full manifestation
[1:01:46] when the squeeze comes on.
[1:01:48] Yeah.
[1:01:49] But but I Yeah. I think I've now the
[1:01:51] squeeze is is is when the pressure comes
[1:01:54] on.
[1:01:55] Yeah. So we are living in a squeeze now.
[1:02:00] Remember it'll be a it'll be ecumenical
[1:02:02] a religious pressure against us. But
[1:02:05] this whole world, you know, we can't we
[1:02:07] already I can't just go pray for people
[1:02:10] in the hospital. I can't go into prisons
[1:02:13] just free and and go preach. There's
[1:02:16] already restrictions. Yeah, you brother
[1:02:17] Greg in Christ Church, he got kicked out
[1:02:19] of the of the prisons because um of
[1:02:24] course he was preaching the truth and
[1:02:25] the and the um and the I can't think of
[1:02:28] the name. The chaplain in the prisons of
[1:02:30] course were denominational people
[1:02:33] and then and then he got kicked out. He
[1:02:34] wasn't allowed to go minister there
[1:02:36] anymore. What's happening? Because a
[1:02:38] squeeze is happening.
[1:02:40] You understand? So there is already a
[1:02:43] squeeze.
[1:02:45] Yeah. Are you following me? So he said
[1:02:46] now when the squeeze comes on the power
[1:02:49] of the third pull will be manifested in
[1:02:51] its fullness.
[1:02:54] Yeah.
[1:02:55] Life and death is in the power of the
[1:02:57] tongue. You understand? So that power
[1:03:01] why you know God I think I've said this
[1:03:04] before but I just trust you know God
[1:03:07] does things in seasons.
[1:03:10] Yeah. You can't go against God's season.
[1:03:13] But there's been many years where things
[1:03:16] haven't been happening all that great
[1:03:18] among believers. But now we're living in
[1:03:20] a different season where God is pouring
[1:03:23] himself out like really like never
[1:03:24] before.
[1:03:26] Yeah.
[1:03:28] And he's doing this because as the enemy
[1:03:31] remember I read on Sunday when the enemy
[1:03:33] comes in like a flood, the Lord raises a
[1:03:36] standard against the enemy coming in
[1:03:39] like a flood. Now, if the enemy is a
[1:03:41] supernatural, remember, we do not
[1:03:42] wrestle against flesh and blood.
[1:03:44] Remember, every enemy you fight is not a
[1:03:46] flesh and blood affair. It's not the
[1:03:48] person, it's the spirit using the
[1:03:50] person.
[1:03:51] Amen. So, that's why you can you can
[1:03:53] hate the spirit on them, but you but you
[1:03:55] got to love the person.
[1:03:57] Amen. Because everyone is right in their
[1:03:59] own eyes. They think they're doing
[1:04:00] right.
[1:04:01] Yeah. So now if the enemy is a
[1:04:04] supernatural enemy and when he gets
[1:04:06] greater and greater well what is the
[1:04:08] standard that God is going to raise
[1:04:10] it's not going to be fundamental
[1:04:12] doctrine this you know it's going to be
[1:04:14] an it's going to be an anointing upon
[1:04:16] the people
[1:04:17] amen because that is going to be the
[1:04:19] standard is remember that the life of
[1:04:21] Jesus might be manifested in your mortal
[1:04:23] flesh.
[1:04:24] Amen. So it doesn't it's not just well
[1:04:26] maybe the minister can do it but it's
[1:04:28] but you know we know there's there's
[1:04:31] there's the anointing on the ministry
[1:04:33] but it's also the individual has to be
[1:04:35] anointed.
[1:04:36] Amen. Remember this is not a this is not
[1:04:38] a here's the Holy Ghost here and then
[1:04:40] everyone else doesn't have it.
[1:04:41] No the true church everyone everyone is
[1:04:44] sealed into the kingdom. Everyone knows
[1:04:45] the dynamic power of the spirit of God.
[1:04:48] Amen.
[1:04:49] So now when the enemy comes in like a
[1:04:51] flood God raises a standard. And so as
[1:04:54] the enemy is getting worse and worse and
[1:04:56] strong, as more demon power is coming
[1:04:58] and it's, you know, in a greater
[1:04:59] reality, what has been happening? God
[1:05:01] has been raising the standard.
[1:05:04] Amen.
[1:05:04] Amen. God has been anointing his
[1:05:06] children. Amen. To overcome every
[1:05:09] pressure and thing and enemy working
[1:05:11] that he has. Yeah. That's what he's been
[1:05:14] doing, you know. And so now, but but the
[1:05:18] reason this is all happening now is
[1:05:19] because we're coming into the season.
[1:05:21] Remember the third pull is already
[1:05:24] there.
[1:05:25] Amen. The power of the third pull is
[1:05:28] already there.
[1:05:30] Yeah. The power of the third bull is
[1:05:31] already here. But as we get closer to
[1:05:33] that time, it'll get greater and greater
[1:05:36] and greater. This is my belief. And we
[1:05:39] are living in that time.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:44] Amen. Well then you see how did remember
[1:05:49] all of those circumstances the
[1:05:50] manifestation of the third pull only one
[1:05:53] of them was a salvation for the family.
[1:05:57] Yeah.
[1:05:58] But who actually activated that?
[1:06:01] Remember we read I believe therefore I
[1:06:04] speak.
[1:06:05] Yeah. I believe therefore I speak. And
[1:06:08] so only one of them is a circumstance
[1:06:10] where where salvation happens. And it
[1:06:13] wasn't the prophet that actually caused
[1:06:15] it to happen. It was it was sister had
[1:06:18] right. I know some of you have heard
[1:06:21] these stories for many years. But it's a
[1:06:23] reality and it happened for a reason.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:26] You know it says in St. John 14:12, I
[1:06:30] think it is. It says, "Verily I say unto
[1:06:33] you,
[1:06:36] where are we?
[1:06:38] Yeah, verely I say unto you, he that
[1:06:39] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:06:41] shall he do also, and greater works than
[1:06:44] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:06:46] father.
[1:06:47] That is not just for brother Brandham.
[1:06:49] That's for the bride of Christ.
[1:06:51] Amen. That is for the bride of Christ.
[1:06:53] And so Haddie Wright sitting there and
[1:06:55] says, and so she believed what she was
[1:06:57] hearing.
[1:06:58] Yep. And says that's nothing but
[1:06:59] something in her just said that's
[1:07:00] nothing but the truth. She responded,
[1:07:03] remember God, I said in the beginning,
[1:07:04] God is looking for your response.
[1:07:07] Amen. And so she by saying that caused
[1:07:12] God to come upon the scene for her two
[1:07:14] sons. Remember she would have had I
[1:07:16] believe she would have had a burn for
[1:07:18] her sons. Amen. But there came that time
[1:07:21] now where she responded to the word that
[1:07:24] was coming forth and she says that's
[1:07:26] nothing but the truth.
[1:07:28] Amen. She activated that for her for her
[1:07:32] sons. Yeah. You say, "Well,
[1:07:36] you know, you take Miriam in the Old
[1:07:38] Testament, they come through the Red
[1:07:41] Sea."
[1:07:42] Amen.
[1:07:44] The enem is being, you know, you you
[1:07:46] know, was drowned there.
[1:07:49] Who was the one who who who begin to
[1:07:52] rejoice and dance?
[1:07:55] It wasn't Moses.
[1:07:56] It wasn't the ministry. It was a woman
[1:07:59] with a tambourine. Amen.
[1:08:01] And she started that whole Pentecostal
[1:08:03] rejoicing right there.
[1:08:04] Amen.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:06] You know, many times it's not the, you
[1:08:08] know, I heard, I might be wrong, but I
[1:08:10] heard the Welsh revival started with a
[1:08:12] little girl in a little house meeting
[1:08:15] and she stood up or began to praise the
[1:08:18] Lord or something and then God be to
[1:08:19] move in that country. But it was started
[1:08:21] by her responding to whatever was going
[1:08:23] on in the service.
[1:08:25] Amen.
[1:08:27] You know, you know, it's like the
[1:08:28] Pentecostal outpouring. It was a blind
[1:08:30] man, a blind, you know, I mean, I mean,
[1:08:32] I mean, a oneeyed colored brother there
[1:08:35] in Isusa Street. And it was through him
[1:08:37] that the whole Pentecostal outpouring
[1:08:39] started in America. Changed the whole
[1:08:41] face of the nation.
[1:08:42] And he was just a nobody.
[1:08:45] Amen. And so now
[1:08:48] the power of life and death is in the
[1:08:50] tongue.
[1:08:52] Yeah. So maybe I'm just going to close
[1:08:55] with this. That's why we need to
[1:08:58] respond.
[1:09:00] You understand? Because remember, I
[1:09:01] believe with all my heart the same God
[1:09:03] that was with brother Brandham, he
[1:09:05] visits us all the time.
[1:09:08] He walks with us. He talks with us. He
[1:09:10] comes to church with us. You know, he's
[1:09:12] the one who who we know. It's not a
[1:09:15] different God. It's not a different
[1:09:16] Jesus. It's the same Jesus.
[1:09:18] It's that same God
[1:09:20] is with us now.
[1:09:22] Amen. So, so if so if H had Wright could
[1:09:25] get what she needed by responding to a
[1:09:28] testimony that the prophet was sharing,
[1:09:30] I believe that God can inspire us that
[1:09:34] when we hear the word or when we hear
[1:09:36] the message, we can respond to it in the
[1:09:38] same way.
[1:09:40] I believe it. We can respond to it in
[1:09:42] the same way.
[1:09:43] Amen.
[1:09:44] Amen.
[1:09:45] And God can begin to act on our behalf.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] Because it can't be remember faith.
[1:09:50] Faith is not a mental workup.
[1:09:52] Faith is not mentally quoting the
[1:09:54] scripture. Faith is not saying, "I think
[1:09:56] this is what God is going to do." Faith
[1:09:58] is a revelation.
[1:10:00] Amen. When it's quickened to you, then
[1:10:02] you got to respond to it.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] Amen. That's what you got to do.
[1:10:07] That's why life and death is in the
[1:10:09] power of the tongue.
[1:10:10] And it's in a greater way in this
[1:10:12] generation than it has been.
[1:10:15] Amen. Because there's creative power.
[1:10:18] Remember, there's creative power in the
[1:10:20] words you speak.
[1:10:22] Yeah. Even it's just even just in your
[1:10:24] home, you can create a lovely
[1:10:25] atmosphere. You can create a terrible
[1:10:26] atmosphere. You can speak unbelief or
[1:10:29] you can speak faith.
[1:10:30] It depends who you agree with.
[1:10:33] Amen. You can speak unbelief and you can
[1:10:36] bring a unbelieving spirit into your
[1:10:38] life by speaking that unbelief or you
[1:10:40] can speak faith and God will come and
[1:10:42] honor that word.
[1:10:44] Amen. That's always sure. You know, Job
[1:10:47] complained to God and there's a
[1:10:50] difference between complaining and
[1:10:51] actually speaking unbelief.
[1:10:54] Amen.
[1:10:56] God didn't hold his complaints against
[1:10:57] him cuz cuz Job didn't understand. You
[1:11:01] hear you hear David's you know a lot of
[1:11:04] David's psalms.
[1:11:06] He was he was crying out to God.
[1:11:10] Amen. And that was a man after God's own
[1:11:12] heart. But he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't
[1:11:15] speaking unbelief.
[1:11:17] Yeah. Because he knew remember the
[1:11:20] anointing that came upon him as a boy.
[1:11:21] He knew he was going to be king.
[1:11:24] Whatever happened, he had confidence
[1:11:26] that God was going to cause him to be on
[1:11:27] the throne.
[1:11:29] Amen. And if that can be David, how much
[1:11:31] more you?
[1:11:32] How much more me?
[1:11:35] Amen. That's why when we look at a circ,
[1:11:39] you know, when we look at a situation,
[1:11:41] you got to look at it for what it is.
[1:11:44] Take the word for what it is.
[1:11:46] Amen. That's why it's so important that
[1:11:48] this becomes personal to you.
[1:11:51] It's one thing for me to say, "No formed
[1:11:53] against you shall prosper." But when it
[1:11:55] anchors into your heart,
[1:11:56] amen, when it anchors into your soul and
[1:11:58] you begin to recognize the devil's
[1:12:00] trying to destroy me, but you can
[1:12:02] rejoice saying, "No weapon
[1:12:04] that is formed against me shall
[1:12:05] prosper."
[1:12:06] Amen.
[1:12:06] It may try, it may try and get the upper
[1:12:08] hand, but it shall not prosper.
[1:12:12] Hallelujah. So when the enemy comes in
[1:12:14] against us or our family or whoever it
[1:12:16] is, you can look that enemy in the face
[1:12:18] and say, "Weapon,
[1:12:19] you've been formed against me, but you
[1:12:21] shall not prosper."
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:23] Hallelujah. And then now God begins to
[1:12:25] act on your behalf.
[1:12:27] Amen.
[1:12:27] Amen. You got to stand in faith.
[1:12:29] Remember, look to the unseen.
[1:12:32] Amen. Remember, he's the high priest of
[1:12:33] our profession. I'm just going to finish
[1:12:35] with this statement. He is the high
[1:12:36] priest. It says there, the high priest
[1:12:38] of our profession or confession. Yeah.
[1:12:42] So, if you're not confessing what he can
[1:12:46] do, he's not going to act on your
[1:12:47] behalf.
[1:12:49] Amen. Remember the Bible says about you
[1:12:53] know you read on Sunday that the word
[1:12:55] will not depart out of thy mouth or the
[1:12:58] mouth of thy seed or thy seed seed.
[1:13:01] Amen. And to me that is not quoting
[1:13:03] scripture I said but it's that living
[1:13:05] God dwelling in them and then the word
[1:13:07] comes out of their mouth.
[1:13:08] That's a promise.
[1:13:09] Amen.
[1:13:10] Amen. You say Lord that's what you said.
[1:13:12] It doesn't matter where they are or
[1:13:13] where they're going in life.
[1:13:15] Amen. You just got to take them. You
[1:13:17] know God's looking for rugged people.
[1:13:19] That's right.
[1:13:20] Amen. That are just bulldog in their
[1:13:22] faith.
[1:13:22] Just take God at his word.
[1:13:25] That's what he's looking for. Don't be
[1:13:27] afraid.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:28] Amen. We should we should have courage.
[1:13:30] Yeah. The devil, he tries to he tries to
[1:13:33] make us disheartened.
[1:13:35] He tries to make us feel like we can't
[1:13:37] win.
[1:13:38] Amen. He make us feel like he'll never
[1:13:40] go away.
[1:13:42] He's a bluff.
[1:13:43] Amen.
[1:13:43] You got to call his hand.
[1:13:46] Amen. You have to. You got to remind
[1:13:48] him. Satan. Remember, as I said, Jonah
[1:13:51] said, "They that obser observe lying
[1:13:54] vanities shall they forsake their own
[1:13:57] mercies."
[1:13:59] Yep. So, if you What does it mean to
[1:14:01] observe something? You study it. I'm
[1:14:03] studying the microphone. Look, it's this
[1:14:05] and I'm studying it.
[1:14:07] Yeah. So, if you look at a problem and
[1:14:10] you observe that problem,
[1:14:14] I'm forsaking my own mercy. Yeah, that's
[1:14:16] true.
[1:14:17] Amen.
[1:14:19] But yeah, and the devil will will will
[1:14:21] anoint this body to be discouraged and
[1:14:24] want to go down a negative way of
[1:14:26] thinking and everything.
[1:14:27] You've got to stop it in its tracks.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:30] And say, you stupid devil.
[1:14:33] Tell them where to go in the name of
[1:14:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:14:35] Amen. And don't be afraid.
[1:14:38] Amen. Have you
[1:14:40] questioned musicians to come? But
[1:14:42] Christine, sister Melanie,
[1:14:44] she was afraid that she could never tell
[1:14:47] Satan to get behind her. And she had
[1:14:50] tried for years to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:51] She had been to the altar many times.
[1:14:54] And then so
[1:14:56] this is some years back. You know,
[1:14:58] Christine's sister Elana had just given
[1:15:01] her life to the Lord. And then she was I
[1:15:04] know it happened, but but she basically
[1:15:06] she said, you know, you know, came into
[1:15:07] Christina and Melany's room and said, "I
[1:15:10] just can't be a Christian." You know,
[1:15:11] she's just all discouraged. And then
[1:15:13] Christine, without saying it, said,
[1:15:15] "Well, do you want to pray?" And they
[1:15:17] prayed. No, God hasn't made himself
[1:15:20] real. Is that is it? Come on.
[1:15:22] I've never felt the Lord. And without
[1:15:24] her thinking, she says, "Well, do you
[1:15:27] want to pray right now?"
[1:15:28] And then they prayed and God came down
[1:15:31] and Elana's screaming and rejoicing
[1:15:33] saying, "Thank you, Lord." And then and
[1:15:35] then Melanie comes over and she's
[1:15:37] praying as well. And but she was afraid
[1:15:40] to say, "Satan, get behind me." Because
[1:15:42] she thought if she said that, the devil
[1:15:43] will grab her. Remember, Satan is a
[1:15:46] bluff.
[1:15:48] Satan equals bluff.
[1:15:49] Amen.
[1:15:50] Okay? Put that in your equation book.
[1:15:52] Okay? Satan equals bluff. Okay? So, so
[1:15:56] she just said, "I don't care. Satan, get
[1:15:57] behind me in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:15:58] The spirit of God fell on her and she's
[1:16:00] been a different person.

[1:19:42] have to earn it, Lord. We didn't qualify
[1:19:44] it. We didn't, Lord. We didn't earn it
[1:19:46] there, Lord. You just came down to where
[1:19:48] we were and you gave it without money or

[1:19:52] just accept what you've done for us,
[1:19:54] Lord. We thank you for your peace. We

[1:20:42] mighty name, Lord. May we look to the
[1:20:43] unseen, oh God, and not worry about
[1:20:45] anything, Lord. Father, sure, we need to

[1:21:13] devil's hand and he's a he's a thief and
[1:21:16] a robber and a liar and he's been
[1:21:17] stripped. Lord, we thank you stripped
[1:21:19] him on Calvary.
[1:21:20] Lord, we thank you, Lord, as your
[1:21:22] prophet said, he's like a wounded animal
[1:21:24] now. You broke his back at Calvary. We
[1:21:26] thank you that you ripped out his
[1:21:27] stinger, oh God. He's just a big buzz.
