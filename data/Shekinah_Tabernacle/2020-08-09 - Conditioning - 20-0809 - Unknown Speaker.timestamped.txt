[19:02] amen amen
[19:05] you can all have your seats this morning
[19:06] we've got two items the first one is
[19:08] from sister naomi
[19:10] and her sunday school class they've got
[19:12] a play they've been working on for weeks
[19:14] and weeks
[19:16] it's actually impromptu it was just this
[19:18] morning
[19:19] and after that we've got um sister vicky
[19:22] has an item
[19:50] fanny you can come up too
[20:12] okay he was joking when he said weeks
[20:15] and weeks we only decided about five
[20:16] minutes before the service to do this um
[20:20] and so
[20:23] what our sunday school class has been
[20:25] talking about is about respect
[20:27] and
[20:30] last week we did two stories and we were
[20:33] talking about how
[20:34] um how you get different results from
[20:37] different um if you make different
[20:40] choices
[20:41] and um so this i'll tell you the second
[20:44] story first we went over two different
[20:46] stories and the second one was of
[20:49] um the widow the widow woman
[20:52] and elijah elijah
[20:55] and elisha
[20:59] the the one was about um
[21:04] elijah and
[21:07] yeah so one was about the widow women
[21:10] and
[21:10] how she gave her everything she had to
[21:13] elijah
[21:14] and because of that she
[21:18] her the barrel never ran dr um the
[21:21] flower and the oil
[21:22] never disappeared until they had rain
[21:25] because she chose to respect the man of
[21:26] god and his service
[21:28] and the other one we did first is what
[21:30] we're gonna play out
[21:32] um this is elisha
[21:35] baldhead turpin um
[21:38] and you will notice also there's one
[21:40] difference there's three she-bears
[21:42] i mean three bears but that's because
[21:46] bears like i mean they like to be bears
[21:50] um so i'm just gonna read the story for
[21:52] you and
[21:54] we're gonna act it out
[21:57] um elisha you go over there okay
[22:05] and he went up from thence talking about
[22:07] elisha
[22:08] unto bethel and as he came forth little
[22:11] children
[22:12] out of the city mocked him and said unto
[22:14] him
[22:15] go up that bald head go up that bald
[22:18] head
[22:23] and it was a lot more intense than that
[22:24] it wasn't just standing there and
[22:26] looking
[22:29] and he turned back and looked on him on
[22:31] them and cursed them in the name of the
[22:33] lord
[22:34] and there came forth two in this case
[22:36] three but that's
[22:37] just because of three bears and growl
[22:43] and um out of the woods and tear up 40
[22:46] and two children of them and he went
[22:48] went from thence unto mount carmel and
[22:49] from thence and he turned to samaria
[22:51] and it was a lot louder than that in the
[22:53] sunday school class
[22:56] but i'm apparently they decided to be a
[22:58] bit quieter now
[22:59] um um yeah so we were just talking about
[23:03] the results of
[23:05] whether you choose to respect an office
[23:07] and
[23:09] in in other words god's choice
[23:12] yeah that's it

[41:47] a four of a lengthy reading trust you
[41:49] don't mind down to verse
[41:50] so from verse 4 down to verse 24
[42:01] amen and he said unto jehoshaphat this
[42:03] is
[42:04] this is the um this is the king of
[42:06] israel and king of samaria coming
[42:08] together to go to war
[42:10] he says will thou go with me to battle
[42:12] to rammoth gilead and jehoshaphat said
[42:14] to the king of israel i am as thou art
[42:16] my people is thy people
[42:18] my horses as thy horses and jehoshaphat
[42:20] said unto the king of israel
[42:22] inquire i pray thee
[42:25] at the word of the lord today then the
[42:27] king of israel gathered the prophets
[42:29] together about
[42:30] 400 men and they said unto them shall i
[42:32] go against ramoth gilead to battle or
[42:34] shall i forbear
[42:36] and they said go up for the lord shall
[42:38] deliver it into the hand of the king
[42:42] hold on sorry
[42:46] and jehoshaphat said is there not
[42:50] uh is there not here a prophet of the
[42:52] lord besides that we might inquire of
[42:54] him
[42:54] and the king of israel said unto
[42:56] jehoshaphat
[42:58] there is yet one man mikaya the son of
[43:01] imla by whom we may inquire of the lord
[43:04] but i hate him for he doth not prophesy
[43:06] good concerning me
[43:07] but evil see everyone likes to hear good
[43:09] things about themselves don't they
[43:11] and um and and jehoshaphat said let not
[43:14] the king
[43:14] say so then the king of israel called an
[43:17] off um an officer
[43:19] and said hasten um hasten hitherto to
[43:22] mikaya the son
[43:23] of imla and the king of israel in
[43:27] jehoshaphat
[43:28] the king of judah sat each on his throne
[43:31] having
[43:32] put on their robes in a void place by
[43:34] the entrance of the gate of samaria and
[43:35] all the prophets prophesied before them
[43:38] and zedekiah the son of uh chenana
[43:41] um made him horns of iron and said thus
[43:44] saith the lord
[43:45] with thee shall thou push the assyrians
[43:47] till thou have consumed them
[43:48] and all the prophets prophesied so
[43:50] saying go up to ramoth gilead and
[43:52] prosper
[43:53] for the lord shall deliver it into the
[43:55] king's hand
[43:57] and the messenger that was gone to call
[43:59] mikaya spake unto him remember this is
[44:00] an officer
[44:01] so the king's trying to put a influence
[44:03] upon him saying behold
[44:05] now the words of the prophets declare
[44:07] good unto the king with one mouth
[44:09] let thy word i pray thee be like the
[44:11] word of one of them and speak that which
[44:13] is good
[44:13] and micaiah said as the lord liveth what
[44:16] the lord saith unto me that will i
[44:18] speak so he came to the king and the
[44:20] king said unto him micaiah
[44:22] shall we go against rammoth gilead to
[44:23] battle or shall we forbid
[44:25] and he answered him go and prosper for
[44:27] the lord shall deliver it
[44:29] into the hand of the king
[44:32] and the king said unto him how many
[44:34] times shall i adjure thee that thou
[44:37] tell me nothing but that which is true
[44:39] in the name of the lord
[44:41] but he just said what the others said
[44:43] and he said i saw all israel scattered
[44:45] upon the hills the sheep
[44:46] that have not a shepherd and the lord
[44:49] said these have no master
[44:51] let them return every man to his house
[44:54] and peace
[44:55] and the king of israel said unto
[44:56] jehoshaphat did i not tell thee
[44:58] that he would prophesy no good
[45:00] concerning me but evil
[45:04] he said uh hear thou therefore the word
[45:07] of the lord
[45:08] i saw the lord sitting on his throne and
[45:10] all the host of heaven standing by him
[45:11] on his right hand and on his left
[45:13] and the lord said who shall persuade
[45:15] ahab that he may go up and fall at
[45:17] ramoth gilead and one
[45:19] said on this manner and the other side
[45:20] on that manner and there came forth a
[45:22] spirit and stood before the lord and
[45:24] said i will persuade him
[45:26] and the lord said unto him wherewith and
[45:28] he said i will
[45:30] i will go forth and i will be a lying
[45:32] spirit in the mouth of all the all of
[45:33] his prophets
[45:35] oh sorry all of his prophets and he said
[45:37] thou shall persuade him and prevail also
[45:40] and go forth and do so
[45:41] now therefore behold the lord hath put a
[45:43] lying spirit in the mouth of all these
[45:44] thy prophets
[45:46] and the lord hath spoken evil
[45:47] concerningly but zedekiah the son of uh
[45:51] chennai went forth and smote mikaya
[45:54] on the cheek and said which way went the
[45:56] spirit of the lord
[45:58] from me to speak unto thee
[46:01] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[46:03] of prayer who
[46:04] if anyone has a need you want us just
[46:06] just raise your hands before the lord
[46:07] this day
[46:08] lord jesus we are so thankful lord we
[46:10] can truly
[46:11] sing lord with understanding and
[46:13] thanksgiving in our hearts that the word
[46:15] is open
[46:16] sin is broken no more darkness no more
[46:19] shame
[46:20] lord that we can come and we can sing
[46:22] lord about how we
[46:23] one day we took our lives our alabaster
[46:25] box who broke it at your feet we pulled
[46:27] out our entire
[46:28] lives lord lord with your love and our
[46:30] hearts lord we worship you
[46:32] dear god we thank you for this day thank
[46:33] you for this morning we can gather and
[46:35] lord lord in this place and i just pray
[46:37] father you just take your words
[46:39] lord take your word lord we know one
[46:41] word from you can change our eternal
[46:43] destination it does oh god
[46:44] so lord i'm just asking may you come and
[46:46] speak this morning
[46:48] lord i just want to get myself out of
[46:49] the way that you can come and have
[46:51] preeminence lord jesus in this service
[46:53] lord may you just take every heart and
[46:55] lift us up into heavenly places in
[46:57] christ jesus

[47:01] you lord
[47:02] please may you grant it dear god we

[47:24] service lord we ask these things in your
[47:27] wonderful name and name the lord jesus
[47:28] christ
[47:29] amen and then god bless your friends you
[47:31] may have your seats and just
[47:33] if you want to turn i just don't want to
[47:34] keep you standing too long so we're
[47:36] going to go also to
[47:37] to the book of matthew and chapter 7 and
[47:40] jesus is speaking here
[47:42] he says this
[47:47] therefore whosoever heareth thee
[47:51] sayings of mine and doth them i
[47:54] will liken him unto a wise man which
[47:56] built his house upon a rock
[47:58] and the rain descended and the floods
[48:00] came and the winds blew
[48:02] and beat upon that house and it fell not
[48:04] for it was founded
[48:06] upon a rock and everyone that heareth
[48:10] these sayings of mine and doeth them not
[48:13] shall be likened unto a foolish man
[48:15] which built his house upon the sand and
[48:18] the rain descended and the floods came
[48:19] and the winds blew
[48:20] and beat upon that house and it fell and
[48:23] great
[48:24] was the fall of it and i want to speak
[48:26] this may
[48:27] seem like an odd kind of text but i want
[48:29] to speak about conditioning
[48:31] how about being being prepared for
[48:33] things we
[48:34] you know we read here about you know
[48:36] we've read about you know your makai and
[48:38] those prophets and
[48:39] and and and we'll come back to those
[48:40] things but you know
[48:43] you go through the scripture and
[48:44] everything has been conditioned by
[48:45] something and even our lives have been
[48:47] conditioned a certain way
[48:49] and i believe it was the cambridge
[48:50] dictionary now i'll probably get going a
[48:52] bit faster
[48:53] a while but let's just lay you know
[48:54] let's just plow for a little bit
[48:56] you know conditioning i believe is from
[48:58] the cambridge dictionary it's the
[48:59] process of training
[49:00] or accustoming a person or or animal to
[49:04] behave in a certain way
[49:05] to accept certain conditions and there's
[49:07] different like psychological
[49:08] conditioning there's different forms of
[49:10] conditioning
[49:11] but this is just the first definition
[49:12] that came up so so be conditioned to
[49:14] something influences your life and
[49:16] changes your behavior based on
[49:18] on that thing now i'm sure we can all
[49:20] agree with all we are all conditioned
[49:23] by a certain way even even our first
[49:25] birth conditions us a certain way
[49:27] you know the traits that we inherit from
[49:29] our father and our mother you know they
[49:31] are
[49:31] inbred into your bread and to us and you
[49:33] know brother brown would speak in the
[49:34] message of paradox and i don't have the
[49:36] quote up here but
[49:37] he would speak about how a how a young
[49:40] man was engaged to a girl or i think
[49:42] just going with that girl and
[49:44] and and he did something to her that
[49:46] that that totally upset her
[49:48] and now the parents were alarmed that he
[49:50] did it and now the parents have gone to
[49:52] brother brown and they're asking
[49:54] asking him why why why'd this happen
[49:58] because they're trying to tap into that
[49:59] gift into his life that the law can come
[50:00] down and reveal it
[50:02] and um and so his parents are both
[50:04] believers and even the son appears to be
[50:06] a believer he's given us he's come to
[50:08] the altar he's been baptized you know he
[50:10] fellowships among the believers but
[50:11] but the parents are wanting to
[50:12] understand why has this happened and
[50:14] and and brother brown you know knew them
[50:17] and he and
[50:18] he knew their extended family and they
[50:19] were the only two that were
[50:21] were believers and so he would he would
[50:23] say about say the mother's family now
[50:25] i'll probably get this mixed up as i
[50:26] normally get things vice versa but
[50:28] but they were part irish and they were
[50:31] they were part german i think the mother
[50:32] was german and then
[50:33] then the mother was irish raised in in
[50:36] america
[50:37] and so brother brown described you know
[50:39] the irish side moody high strung high
[50:41] tempered
[50:42] and that came into the boy and then the
[50:43] german side indifferent to religion
[50:45] you know kind of you know not very
[50:47] engaging anyway that and
[50:49] and that came into the boy but then
[50:51] brother bam said about the parents
[50:52] you're not like that because you've been
[50:54] born again
[50:55] so so his first birth so their first
[50:58] birth
[50:58] conditioned them a certain way so when
[51:01] i'm talking about conditioning i'm not
[51:02] saying well you know we have all been
[51:03] conditioned by something
[51:05] you know so so they were conditioned a
[51:07] certain way by
[51:08] by just the genes the the nature the
[51:11] spirit that came down you know you know
[51:12] their first birth condition them a
[51:14] certain way
[51:14] they said you're not like that anymore
[51:16] because you've actually met the lord
[51:18] and but then even the father was so
[51:20] confused by this big
[51:22] because he said you know because brother
[51:23] brahm said i would advise this young man
[51:25] never marry this girl
[51:27] never marry anyone because he'll make it
[51:29] hell on earth for her
[51:30] and then the father said but my son has
[51:32] been baptized he's come to the altar
[51:34] given his heart to the lord i know my
[51:35] son has come to christ
[51:37] and brother i said no he's done all the
[51:38] outward things but until that new nature
[51:41] comes into him he says i advise that boy
[51:43] never to marry
[51:44] so it can appear so close right
[51:47] but what's really conditioning us
[51:51] now this house that we read about here
[51:54] i've got everyone's attention hey praise
[51:57] the lord
[51:58] you know this house we read about the
[52:00] wise house is conditioned
[52:02] it was prepared for storms it was
[52:04] prepared we know in our life there's
[52:06] always going to be storms
[52:08] we cannot insulate our entire life
[52:11] from any spirit of the devil any any
[52:14] hardship
[52:15] any misunderstandings any pain we can't
[52:17] live in a complete bubble
[52:19] otherwise we'd be up in glory because
[52:21] that's the only way we can be
[52:22] truly you know so and and this won't be
[52:25] today but but maybe
[52:26] the next service i want to go into you
[52:28] know i you know i read on facebook
[52:30] someone just put on there what not even
[52:31] a believer just talking about psychology
[52:33] or something
[52:34] he said parents many parents you know
[52:37] there's there's two options raising
[52:39] children and and and this is for adults
[52:40] too
[52:41] you're either prepared for the road so
[52:44] so you're prepared for you are prepared
[52:45] for life's journey
[52:46] or you try and prepare the road for the
[52:49] child
[52:50] so so what does that mean so so to
[52:52] prepare the road for the child what do
[52:54] you do you put up road blocks
[52:55] you put up cones you get law enforcement
[52:57] no car's going to cross that road
[52:59] because the child's walking
[53:02] but that's not how life can be right
[53:04] you've got to prepare the child that
[53:05] they can cross the road
[53:07] amen so that's the conditioning
[53:10] so but but that's that's maybe next next
[53:13] time
[53:14] but i just want you to think about it
[53:16] because we're all conditioned if there's
[53:17] influences in our lives that condition
[53:20] us just to to to think a certain way
[53:22] to look at things a certain way even our
[53:24] thought pattern
[53:25] is based on a conditioning but we want
[53:28] to be conditioned
[53:29] uh by the word of the lord amen
[53:32] so so this house i'm sure you can agree
[53:34] the the wise man
[53:37] conditioned the house he knew storms
[53:39] would come
[53:40] he knew there'd be winds he knew there'd
[53:42] be rain he knew there'd be trouble
[53:44] but he conditioned the house remember it
[53:46] can be the same kind of house on the
[53:47] outside
[53:48] but one the man had the foresight or the
[53:51] vision
[53:51] to dig down through the sand dig down
[53:54] through maybe the sander
[53:55] looked better up on the sand but he
[53:57] wanted to make sure the house was
[53:59] conditioned to stand
[54:00] when trouble came i mean so so that's
[54:03] always the thing you know we can't just
[54:04] we this is not a picnic life is not a
[54:06] picnic remember even you know even
[54:09] the same trials that happen to a people
[54:11] in the world that happen to us
[54:12] we're not exempt from anything we're not
[54:14] exempt from any spirit
[54:16] any trouble we don't get to get out of
[54:18] jail free card
[54:19] right we we we still have to endure and
[54:22] be tested and be tried
[54:24] but if where our lives are conditioned
[54:26] the right way
[54:27] amen the the wind will come the rain
[54:30] will come the storms will come the
[54:31] trouble will come the misunderstandings
[54:33] will come
[54:33] amen the hurt will come the wounds will
[54:35] come the complexes will come but yet we
[54:38] will stand
[54:39] i mean so i i i believe i'm looking at
[54:42] wise people
[54:43] i mean that that that that consider
[54:45] things of the future consider
[54:47] current scenarios of life and they and
[54:49] they don't just plow through blindly but
[54:51] they're looking
[54:52] looking ahead lord what's the best way
[54:55] amen you know i'm glad you know the
[54:57] bible says and james if any man lacks
[54:59] wisdom
[55:00] let him ask god he'll give it abundantly
[55:02] i'm glad about that verse
[55:03] hallelujah amen and so but the foolish
[55:07] man
[55:09] did not prepare his house his house
[55:12] wasn't conditioned
[55:14] for the trouble amen now
[55:21] these prophets here
[55:24] they were sincere people
[55:28] they weren't indifferent they were
[55:30] sincere
[55:32] they weren't heathens they were hebrew
[55:33] prophets they were believers
[55:36] they were believers but they were
[55:38] conditioned by the wrong thing
[55:40] actually let's just stop let's just go
[55:42] through the body soul and
[55:43] spirit and soul in the world people are
[55:46] conditioned
[55:47] athletes have to be conditioned to
[55:49] compete right
[55:50] they don't just no one in the world that
[55:52] i know of right just
[55:54] rolls out of bed says i'm going to be in
[55:56] all black and then the next minute
[55:58] they're in all black
[55:59] you know like monday morning i'm going
[56:00] to be in all black saturday he's on the
[56:02] field
[56:03] it doesn't work that way someone has to
[56:06] be conditioned
[56:07] to be on the field right and and that's
[56:09] just not in the sporting arena that's in
[56:11] any arena
[56:12] you know it could be business whatever
[56:13] it may be people actually have to be
[56:15] conditioned
[56:16] they have to be prepared they have to be
[56:18] you know come into a routine of life
[56:21] in order to to actually achieve what
[56:23] they want to achieve
[56:24] i mean and and i'm sure you can agree
[56:26] with me
[56:27] just even not just because i just said
[56:29] it but you know everyone
[56:31] everyone who actually uh obtains
[56:34] anything in life
[56:35] they're conditioned a certain way right
[56:38] even you take elon musk or
[56:40] um the guy who owns amazon or whoever
[56:44] they've conditioned themselves they see
[56:46] a goal
[56:47] whatever it is can be selfish not
[56:49] selfish whatever they want to do
[56:51] do it and they condition their lives in
[56:53] order to
[56:54] obtain that right they didn't just roll
[56:56] out of bed so i'm going to invent amazon
[56:58] i'm going to rule the world by
[56:59] over the internet and there they are no
[57:01] no it takes conditioning
[57:03] amen and then so so anyone who even just
[57:06] a functioning member of society
[57:08] that has a job or has a family or you
[57:10] know both or you know
[57:12] have a career or whatever they condition
[57:14] themselves
[57:15] i mean to to fulfill that right they
[57:18] have a routine
[57:20] amen now a lot of you are looking at me
[57:22] like you're just being captain obvious
[57:23] today
[57:24] well maybe i am but you know we're
[57:26] conditioned by something
[57:28] you know people don't just roll out of
[57:29] bed and now they're the ceo of a company
[57:31] or they're a multi-billionaire they're
[57:32] conditioned
[57:33] right so so that's just in the natural
[57:36] people you know
[57:38] professional athletes they spend their
[57:40] whole life
[57:42] right conditioning themselves mental
[57:44] toughness not just physical toughness
[57:46] mental toughness
[57:47] right and in order to compete
[57:51] we need routine we need a routine we
[57:54] need discipline
[57:56] right because you know the biggest
[57:57] problem brother braham says that even
[57:59] in this day there's actually the curse
[58:01] no well i don't know if he said the word
[58:03] curse but there's a
[58:04] there's a problem with soft living
[58:07] it's actually a bad thing now i don't
[58:10] want to go live in the third world don't
[58:11] get me wrong but but there's actually
[58:13] there's always pros and cons for all
[58:14] things right so so there's actually a
[58:16] con
[58:17] of actually having it too good because
[58:19] if you have it too good then then you
[58:21] don't have any drive to do anything
[58:23] why do i need to do anything i get i get
[58:24] money from the government i can just
[58:26] live off the pigs back you know i can
[58:28] you know i can get everything i need
[58:30] live a certain way man is not built just
[58:33] to
[58:33] do that man is built to have a goal have
[58:36] an aspiration in life
[58:38] and then i'm not just talking about
[58:39] christians i'm talking about anyone
[58:42] so so this society has conditioned us a
[58:44] certain way
[58:46] right different countries condition
[58:47] their people a certain way
[58:49] this country's conditioned us a certain
[58:50] way amen so
[58:54] these prophets so so that's just now
[58:58] that's just now
[58:59] in the in the natural anyone who wants
[59:01] to do anything
[59:02] they become conditioned right they have
[59:05] a drive in their life they want to
[59:06] obtain something
[59:08] and then their whole life is focused
[59:09] around that
[59:11] right amen remember the era of
[59:13] professionals i mean i mean amateur
[59:15] sport is well and truly gone
[59:17] well and truly gone even even i think in
[59:20] our
[59:20] my generation oh boy i can't believe i
[59:22] said that but you know
[59:24] that was when professional like rugby
[59:26] had gone out the door i
[59:27] mean had had had come in there was
[59:30] amateurs
[59:31] but now it came fully professional is in
[59:33] my lifetime
[59:34] so you know if that's the way
[59:38] naturally then what about spiritually
[59:41] amen we're not we're not sunday morning
[59:43] christians we're not wednesday night
[59:44] christians we're
[59:45] 24 7 christians hallelujah amen we're
[59:48] being conditioned by a word
[59:50] hallelujah i mean so now that's just in
[59:52] the natural now now now if we go into
[59:54] the spiritual
[59:55] we read about these um well well we read
[59:57] about these prophets here and so i don't
[59:59] have a blank for this thing but oh well
[1:00:01] oh no wait we can just go back to that
[1:00:02] one now these these prophets they
[1:00:04] the king had 400 trained hebrew prophets
[1:00:08] and they were in the office of a prophet
[1:00:10] i do not believe they were not sincere
[1:00:12] they were sincere men
[1:00:14] but you see the the influence of the
[1:00:17] king
[1:00:17] conditioned them very differently to
[1:00:20] micaiah
[1:00:21] right they were conditioned brother
[1:00:23] brown would say if
[1:00:25] if i think i have it here just uh
[1:00:29] he said this isn't perseverant and so
[1:00:31] they went up and got 400 well-fed
[1:00:33] trained prophets so now here were these
[1:00:36] 400 prophets and they begin to lean
[1:00:38] because the king
[1:00:39] you say they were good they were well
[1:00:41] fed
[1:00:43] you know but but they were they but
[1:00:45] their conditioning
[1:00:46] came from a natural man their
[1:00:48] conditioning came from a church system
[1:00:51] right they were leaning oh who are you
[1:00:53] i'm one of the king's prophets
[1:00:55] that came with benefits you know like
[1:00:57] jobs they get you know certain benefits
[1:00:58] come with a job
[1:00:59] you know some get house car whatever
[1:01:02] made you know all those things you know
[1:01:03] free travel
[1:01:04] these guys got perks but the problem is
[1:01:07] their conditioning came from the wrong
[1:01:09] source so now what happens is these ones
[1:01:12] could be
[1:01:12] influenced by a natural man a man by
[1:01:16] ahab who wasn't a godly king right he
[1:01:18] wasn't like david or hezekiah
[1:01:20] he was a he was not a godly king he was
[1:01:23] one of the most
[1:01:24] evil kings that had ever come into the
[1:01:25] land and now these ones were
[1:01:27] under his influence so now whatever he
[1:01:30] wanted
[1:01:31] basically they would get religious about
[1:01:33] it amen and they could be swayed by his
[1:01:36] influence
[1:01:37] whatever way he wanted remember he
[1:01:39] wanted to go and fight
[1:01:41] he wanted to go take ramos gilead that
[1:01:43] was already his motive
[1:01:44] he wasn't neutral when he asked him can
[1:01:46] you seek the lord and see what we should
[1:01:48] do should we go or not no he already
[1:01:49] made up his mind that's why he got the
[1:01:51] other king
[1:01:52] with him right they made up their mind
[1:01:55] so now these ones under that influence
[1:01:57] because they were conditioned by a
[1:01:58] natural man's thinking
[1:02:00] right they begin to just prophesy and
[1:02:02] get excited and things and what they
[1:02:03] said naturally lined up with what he
[1:02:05] said
[1:02:06] even though they were fundamental they
[1:02:08] were sincere they were hebrew prophets
[1:02:10] they weren't unbelievers
[1:02:11] but yet because they were just
[1:02:13] conditioned in their spirit realm
[1:02:16] i mean they were they would only say
[1:02:18] what the king wanted them to say
[1:02:20] and and how subtle that would be you say
[1:02:23] but you know
[1:02:24] how shocked they would have been when
[1:02:26] when when makaya came up
[1:02:29] and you know mackay he wasn't
[1:02:31] conditioned
[1:02:32] according to how the other prophets were
[1:02:35] is everyone following me maybe
[1:02:37] maybe we're just going to go a bit slow
[1:02:38] today but but we're going to get up the
[1:02:39] hill
[1:02:40] maybe we're in the passing lane and
[1:02:41] other ones are going past us but but
[1:02:43] we're going to get up okay but i want
[1:02:46] this to sink in
[1:02:47] because i said because the question
[1:02:48] should be lord what is conditioning my
[1:02:50] life
[1:02:51] it can appear to be so close remember
[1:02:53] ramoth gilead was israel's possession
[1:02:56] right it was part of their inheritance
[1:02:57] it was god-given place
[1:02:59] but they had lost it and it wasn't the
[1:03:01] season to re to
[1:03:02] to to go get it back it means they were
[1:03:05] trying to work in the word at the wrong
[1:03:06] season
[1:03:07] right but the but the motive of it was
[1:03:10] not a pure
[1:03:11] motive it was actually the king wanted
[1:03:12] it so they're going to come under the
[1:03:14] vision of an earthly king
[1:03:16] and then so but but the king of um
[1:03:18] israel
[1:03:20] i don't know no the king of samaria he
[1:03:23] was
[1:03:23] he was you know yo jehoshaphat the king
[1:03:25] of israel so i know
[1:03:26] king of samaria he he had a bitter god
[1:03:29] about him
[1:03:30] imagine that 400 prophets 400 ministers
[1:03:33] they had a minister's meeting they
[1:03:34] gathered all these ministers
[1:03:36] and they begin to maybe sing and you
[1:03:38] know you know one mind but we're one
[1:03:40] mind one heart one accord
[1:03:42] the move is on brother we're gonna take
[1:03:43] this place
[1:03:45] oh my it would have been exciting
[1:03:47] they're up on their thrones the kings
[1:03:48] were outside the gate and you know it
[1:03:50] was all the pomp and the ceremony and
[1:03:52] it was an international well it's a
[1:03:54] national convention
[1:03:56] here comes the minister who's going to
[1:03:58] preach first who's going to have the
[1:03:59] inspiration first they are excited and
[1:04:01] you know but it was under the wrong
[1:04:03] inspiration
[1:04:05] because they were conditioned by a king
[1:04:07] not by the word
[1:04:09] and so it would have been quite a thing
[1:04:11] but then but then jehoshaphat had a
[1:04:13] little bit of god about him
[1:04:15] and and he asked the king of israel do
[1:04:18] you have one more
[1:04:20] that sounds kind of ridiculous doesn't
[1:04:22] it what do you mean i got 400
[1:04:24] they're well fed look at them they're
[1:04:26] conditioned
[1:04:28] they're conditioned you know you know
[1:04:31] they're well fed look how well
[1:04:33] robed they are and you know all these
[1:04:34] things they know the scripture just
[1:04:35] right they can quote it just right
[1:04:37] they can quote the message of moses just
[1:04:40] right
[1:04:41] amen but he says there's got to be one
[1:04:44] more surely
[1:04:45] and then and then the king you know said
[1:04:47] to him yeah there's one
[1:04:48] but i hate this guy i don't let the king
[1:04:51] say so
[1:04:52] why he always prophesies against me oh
[1:04:54] let's just go get him
[1:04:56] interesting isn't it there's always the
[1:04:58] you know there's always the one just to
[1:04:59] rock the boat a little bit
[1:05:01] but it's the boat rocking one that's
[1:05:02] normally the godly one
[1:05:04] i mean so so here was now someone that
[1:05:07] wasn't under the influence of the king
[1:05:09] and god i mean and and the king sent an
[1:05:12] officer to him a man of influence
[1:05:14] to go speak to him and you know as
[1:05:16] they're coming back you know
[1:05:18] he he would say to him you know you know
[1:05:19] brother mackay you've been out of
[1:05:21] fellowship so long you know you've been
[1:05:23] by yourself and you know
[1:05:25] just say what they say this is how the
[1:05:27] meeting's been going oh boy brother
[1:05:29] so-and-so got up and preached about
[1:05:30] we're going to take the fullness of the
[1:05:31] land and
[1:05:32] you know we got excited and they begin
[1:05:34] to prophesy and
[1:05:35] you know the header head of the
[1:05:36] ministerials you know association made
[1:05:38] some horns and he said by these you'll
[1:05:40] push them out of the land and
[1:05:41] oh boy the anointing was incredible you
[1:05:43] should say what they say
[1:05:45] we're excited the move is on brother the
[1:05:47] move is on
[1:05:48] but but he wasn't conditioned by a
[1:05:51] system
[1:05:52] he wasn't conditioned by his society he
[1:05:55] wasn't conditioned by what the king
[1:05:56] would say he said
[1:05:58] i'm only going to say what god says
[1:06:00] because he had a different kind of
[1:06:02] conditioning and now this is where it
[1:06:03] comes down
[1:06:04] you say brother talks about the thin
[1:06:06] edge of the wedge
[1:06:07] between the make and the truth and and
[1:06:11] and he
[1:06:11] he just said i'm going to say only what
[1:06:13] god would say
[1:06:14] so he wasn't influenced by by by the men
[1:06:18] he was only influenced by the word and
[1:06:20] so here he was he comes up
[1:06:23] and then and then the king says to him
[1:06:26] what's your message from god what word
[1:06:27] do you have what are you going to preach
[1:06:28] on
[1:06:30] go up and take it and there's something
[1:06:33] obviously in his voice where the king
[1:06:34] says this guy's just sarcastic
[1:06:36] he always says evil against me he just
[1:06:37] said what the others said
[1:06:39] and then he began to open up his vision
[1:06:42] remember he wasn't looking at
[1:06:44] the king he wasn't looking at what the
[1:06:46] other brothers were saying
[1:06:47] he was looking what the word had said
[1:06:49] and because he had a vindicated prophet
[1:06:51] before him
[1:06:52] elijah prophesied that the dogs were
[1:06:55] going to lick
[1:06:56] ahab's blood amen so he knew so so
[1:06:59] elijah had gone off the scene all they
[1:07:01] had was the message of elijah
[1:07:03] amen all they had was the message of
[1:07:05] elijah and so he knew it had to be
[1:07:07] fulfilled
[1:07:08] this man had to die amen amen so so he
[1:07:12] knew this is what's going to happen and
[1:07:13] then you know he believed now
[1:07:15] here we were the stage is set
[1:07:18] the bases are loaded it's all ready
[1:07:21] hallelujah and so so so he said no
[1:07:24] i saw israel scattered was like sheep
[1:07:27] without it
[1:07:28] out of shepherd and this this offended
[1:07:32] the other prophets and then it offended
[1:07:35] him moore said okay i'll tell you what i
[1:07:36] saw brothers
[1:07:38] i was praying and the spirit of god came
[1:07:39] down and he lifted me up into heavenly
[1:07:41] places
[1:07:42] and i saw the throne room and then god
[1:07:45] was having a conference up in heaven
[1:07:47] because remember if something's
[1:07:48] happening on earth something's happening
[1:07:49] in heaven too
[1:07:50] right even now something's going on in
[1:07:51] heaven because there's a conference on
[1:07:53] earth
[1:07:53] hallelujah and he said he said god said
[1:07:55] to everyone there
[1:07:57] how can we make ahab fulfill what elijah
[1:07:59] prophesied
[1:08:01] how we're going to make this word
[1:08:02] fulfilled and one spirit you know one
[1:08:04] said this other said this this one said
[1:08:06] this
[1:08:06] then a lying spirit from hell came up
[1:08:09] and said i'll get them to fulfill
[1:08:11] i'll get them to go and i'll get him to
[1:08:13] end up in that battle
[1:08:15] and then the and then the head
[1:08:18] head prophet was so offended by this he
[1:08:21] went
[1:08:22] any and he slapped him in the mouth see
[1:08:24] when did the spirit of god
[1:08:25] you know come out of me and all these
[1:08:27] things you know he said no no
[1:08:29] you're anointed by a lying spirit
[1:08:32] and the reason he could say that because
[1:08:33] it wasn't with the word for the day
[1:08:36] right it was contrary the word said this
[1:08:39] man had to die in battle
[1:08:41] are you following me so you've got to
[1:08:42] look at your conditioning we can be
[1:08:44] caught up in so many things but what are
[1:08:46] we conditioned by
[1:08:48] amen because those prophets were sincere
[1:08:50] they were sincere men
[1:08:52] and they felt an anointing i felt
[1:08:54] inspired i believe his um
[1:08:56] um what's his name was you know the head
[1:08:58] prophet
[1:08:59] he would have felt inspired picking up
[1:09:01] those horns and running around
[1:09:02] he wasn't putting on a show he was
[1:09:05] actually being a sign remember prophets
[1:09:06] can be signs
[1:09:08] right so so he was he was a sincere man
[1:09:11] and so he got offended at at makai
[1:09:13] zedekiah did
[1:09:15] yeah you know and then he and he slapped
[1:09:18] him in the mouth
[1:09:20] but micaiah said no this is what i saw
[1:09:23] in heaven
[1:09:24] and we're in the fulfillment of that and
[1:09:27] then ahab said after this yo take him
[1:09:29] into in a prison and feed him the bread
[1:09:31] of sorrow and water of sorrow and
[1:09:33] you know and then mackay said if you
[1:09:34] return it all god didn't speak to me
[1:09:37] this man was influenced conditioned by
[1:09:39] the lord himself
[1:09:41] amen and this is how we have to be in
[1:09:43] this day we have to be conditioned by
[1:09:45] the word
[1:09:46] not by human influence not by emotional
[1:09:49] entanglement
[1:09:51] amen not by oh everyone else is doing it
[1:09:53] but we're going to be conditioned by the
[1:09:55] word of god
[1:09:56] hallelujah and that is the only thing
[1:09:59] that will stand in this day
[1:10:01] amen this this day of supercharged
[1:10:03] emotionalism and you know different
[1:10:04] things
[1:10:05] we can't be caught up in something that
[1:10:07] is not according to the scripture
[1:10:09] you know sadly if it's been prophesied
[1:10:12] that america is going to be smoke bombs
[1:10:14] and craters it's going to be smoke bombs
[1:10:16] and craters
[1:10:16] right if it says that the catholic
[1:10:18] church will rule the world it's going to
[1:10:19] happen
[1:10:20] amen if it says them yo it's going to be
[1:10:22] chaos you know
[1:10:24] pre-tribulation times are here it's
[1:10:26] going to be here
[1:10:28] unfortunately so we have to walk
[1:10:31] according to the promise of the day
[1:10:33] what is the promise of the day a rapture
[1:10:36] amen this is what we're to be
[1:10:37] conditioned to that promise
[1:10:38] amen that we walk with god we walk in
[1:10:40] his word hallelujah and then he'll take
[1:10:42] us because we're not because god took us
[1:10:45] hallelujah so we need to be conditioned
[1:10:47] we know we know that there's more demon
[1:10:49] power upon this earth than any other day
[1:10:51] we know that we see it on the streets so
[1:10:54] we've got to be conditioned to withstand
[1:10:55] it
[1:10:56] i mean there should be something you
[1:10:58] know i love i love
[1:11:00] real christianity because of the
[1:11:02] personal relationship with jesus christ
[1:11:04] amen and whenever a spirit comes against
[1:11:07] you there should be something in you
[1:11:08] saying that is not of me
[1:11:10] i mean there should be something in you
[1:11:11] saying that is wrong it doesn't matter
[1:11:13] how dressed up it is what it appears to
[1:11:15] be there should be something in you
[1:11:16] saying
[1:11:16] i will not fall for that i mean because
[1:11:18] i've been conditioned by the holy ghost
[1:11:20] i'm not just conditioned in my spirit or
[1:11:22] in my body i'm conditioning my soul
[1:11:25] that's how it needs to be amen when a
[1:11:27] spirit because remember there's so many
[1:11:29] spirits in this day
[1:11:30] trying to pull us and drag us and get us
[1:11:32] caught up in all different kinds of
[1:11:34] things
[1:11:34] but we're going to be conditioned when
[1:11:35] the enemy comes in like a flood there's
[1:11:37] got to be a standard raised up
[1:11:39] hallelujah amen because the storms will
[1:11:42] come the rain will come spirits will
[1:11:44] come
[1:11:45] i mean pain will come misunderstandings
[1:11:47] will come
[1:11:48] hallelujah be being between two opinions
[1:11:50] will come all those things will come but
[1:11:52] if we're conditioned amen by the holy
[1:11:55] ghost himself
[1:11:56] we will be able to stand amen
[1:11:59] hallelujah amen they were well
[1:12:03] well-fed prophets now the apostle paul
[1:12:06] would say this in
[1:12:07] in romans 12 i beseech you therefore
[1:12:10] brethren by the mercies of god
[1:12:12] that you present your bodies as a living
[1:12:14] sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god
[1:12:17] which is your reasonable service
[1:12:19] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:12:22] be
[1:12:23] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:24] that ye may prove
[1:12:26] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:12:29] perfect
[1:12:29] will of god so do not be conditioned by
[1:12:32] the world
[1:12:33] don't be conditioned by this world but
[1:12:35] be conditioned by the holy ghost which
[1:12:37] transforms you
[1:12:39] amen that's that is that is what we need
[1:12:41] to do
[1:12:42] hallelujah amen so so we shouldn't be
[1:12:45] conditioned by
[1:12:46] what society is telling us amen we
[1:12:49] shouldn't be caught up in what society
[1:12:51] is telling us
[1:12:51] we need to be conditioned by the word of
[1:12:53] god i mean that we can walk
[1:12:56] you know you take the apostle paul
[1:12:58] incredible man
[1:13:00] there was there was antichrist spirits
[1:13:02] floating around in that day the
[1:13:03] galatians were pulled this way
[1:13:04] corinthians were caught up in this
[1:13:06] you know the ephesians they forgot to
[1:13:07] love their families and you know
[1:13:09] different things were going on there was
[1:13:10] fear and worry in the thessalonica
[1:13:12] church and
[1:13:13] you know but he could walk among all of
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:17] and call people back to the word of god
[1:13:21] amen he was conditioned he met the lord
[1:13:24] on the road to damascus he got
[1:13:25] conditioned
[1:13:26] hallelujah and then he could walk in
[1:13:28] that world that great change you know
[1:13:30] time of change going on christianity was
[1:13:32] just coming into the world
[1:13:33] the gentiles were coming in there was a
[1:13:35] lot of questions there's a lot of
[1:13:37] trouble antichrist spirits trying to
[1:13:38] come in and drag people back into the
[1:13:40] law and
[1:13:40] different things going on but he could
[1:13:42] walk among that whole mess
[1:13:44] and call the bride now if that was in
[1:13:48] the beginning it's got to be at the end
[1:13:50] there's got to be a people upon the
[1:13:51] earth that don't be tossed to and fro by
[1:13:53] every wind of doctrine every deed of
[1:13:55] nicolaitanism
[1:13:56] you know all these things going on and
[1:13:58] we can walk between
[1:14:00] it all and yet be a shining light to
[1:14:02] everyone
[1:14:03] but come under the influence of none of
[1:14:04] it
[1:14:06] i believe i'm looking at those kind of
[1:14:08] people this message has come
[1:14:09] amen that we can be these kind of people
[1:14:12] hallelujah
[1:14:14] amen so to be transformed by the
[1:14:16] renewing of your mind
[1:14:17] now conditioning can happen suddenly i
[1:14:20] mean slowly slowly slowly or it can
[1:14:22] happen very quickly
[1:14:24] i believe those 400 profits it was a
[1:14:26] process
[1:14:27] they slowly came under the influence of
[1:14:29] the king until they are completely
[1:14:31] reliant on the king
[1:14:33] but it can happen very quickly
[1:14:37] adam was a god over the earth god told
[1:14:40] adam and eve
[1:14:41] have dominion subdue it yes this is your
[1:14:44] domain
[1:14:45] adam's last act as a god man was trying
[1:14:47] to redeem his wife
[1:14:49] he wasn't deceived in the transgression
[1:14:50] the scripture tells us eve was he he
[1:14:52] went with his eyes open
[1:14:54] he knew what he had to do with his life
[1:14:56] last act as a
[1:14:57] as as as um as a god man i'll put it
[1:15:00] that way
[1:15:02] was to try and redeem his wife but as
[1:15:04] soon as sin came in as soon as he fell
[1:15:06] from his position
[1:15:07] he was conditioned by sin and then now
[1:15:10] when god
[1:15:11] calls the calls calls adam and eve and
[1:15:13] the serpent to a conference
[1:15:15] and he begins to ask who calls all this
[1:15:17] stuff
[1:15:18] then adam it says the man said the woman
[1:15:20] whom now gave us to be with me
[1:15:23] she gave me of the tree and i did eat so
[1:15:25] automatically sin has conditioned him
[1:15:28] to blame someone else right he's
[1:15:30] actually telling god god
[1:15:31] you are the result you are the cause of
[1:15:34] this problem because you gave me this
[1:15:35] woman
[1:15:37] it's not me i didn't do it i'm innocent
[1:15:39] i'm just an innocent bystander i'm just
[1:15:40] caught up i'm a victim of circumstance
[1:15:42] but he chose to do it because because it
[1:15:45] was christ and adam
[1:15:47] trying to redeem his fallen bride but as
[1:15:49] soon as sin came in
[1:15:50] he blames everyone else i'm a victim of
[1:15:53] circumstance my parents are this way so
[1:15:54] i'm this way and my
[1:15:56] school's this way so i'm this way and
[1:15:57] this people this way my church is this
[1:15:59] way so i'm this way
[1:16:00] hold on hold on
[1:16:03] if we're conditioned by the word we can
[1:16:06] be like mikaya
[1:16:08] and we can walk into a convention harley
[1:16:11] and not be caught up in the anointing
[1:16:12] that's there if it's not of god
[1:16:14] and we can discern and withstand the
[1:16:16] antichrist spirit
[1:16:18] just like mackay did because he saw the
[1:16:20] inspiration that was coming forth out of
[1:16:22] those men was wrong
[1:16:23] because it was contrary to the word of
[1:16:25] the hour hallelujah but you see when
[1:16:27] when when sin has conditioned us a
[1:16:29] certain way
[1:16:30] man will never take responsibility for
[1:16:33] his own actions
[1:16:34] you know my parents always told me take
[1:16:37] responsibility for what you do
[1:16:40] that's what we have to do you can't
[1:16:41] blame someone else
[1:16:43] it's like if i get in the car and i run
[1:16:45] someone over i can't blame that person
[1:16:47] i was driving the car and just say if i
[1:16:50] was drunk driving god forbid
[1:16:52] i never would but you know well the lord
[1:16:54] take the desire out of me so you know
[1:16:56] but i've told you that probably many
[1:16:57] times but you know if i get drunk and
[1:17:00] i'm driving behind a car and i hit
[1:17:02] someone
[1:17:03] i can't say that guy shouldn't have been
[1:17:04] on the road
[1:17:06] i have to take responsibility i caused
[1:17:08] that man's death
[1:17:10] right and it's the same thing even
[1:17:13] with anything i'm just a poor little
[1:17:16] victim hold on
[1:17:18] what are you doing with what happened
[1:17:20] because with sin
[1:17:21] people try and bypass the new birth by
[1:17:24] actually saying no
[1:17:25] i'm not a sinner they don't take
[1:17:27] responsibility
[1:17:28] for living with this fallen nature that
[1:17:30] you're born with
[1:17:31] remember we have the ability this
[1:17:32] morning you can take that for the nature
[1:17:34] you're born with and get rid of the
[1:17:35] thing
[1:17:36] and be birthed into the kingdom amen but
[1:17:38] if you say well i'm just a good little
[1:17:40] person
[1:17:40] no hold on we're all born lost right
[1:17:44] but there's someone here who can find us
[1:17:46] you just got to put your little hand up
[1:17:47] say lord jesus here i
[1:17:48] am hallelujah so
[1:17:52] sin conditioned adam real quick
[1:17:55] and he blamed god this is god's fault
[1:17:59] you know he's the reason for this
[1:18:03] but god knew it would happen but god
[1:18:05] didn't cause it to happen
[1:18:06] he allowed it to happen two different
[1:18:08] things so we can't go get mad at god for
[1:18:11] things
[1:18:12] amen we should never ever get mad this
[1:18:14] is god's fault hold on
[1:18:16] hold on before you were born he made a
[1:18:18] way
[1:18:19] before you were ever born he made a way
[1:18:21] for you to overcome in this trial
[1:18:23] hallelujah why the lamb was slammed
[1:18:25] before the foundational world so before
[1:18:27] there was a devil
[1:18:28] before the one who actually caused the
[1:18:30] whole thing happen god made a way for
[1:18:31] you to overcome him in this day
[1:18:34] hallelujah amen conditioning can be
[1:18:38] also because of
[1:18:41] make believers pharaoh's heart was
[1:18:44] hardened
[1:18:45] because after aaron threw down the rod
[1:18:47] of moses his magicians did the same
[1:18:49] thing
[1:18:50] oh you've got supernatural in your
[1:18:51] church mike can do it too
[1:18:54] but the motive behind the two are
[1:18:56] different one was
[1:18:57] i want the people to stay in slavery so
[1:19:00] never overcome
[1:19:01] sin never overcome unbelief but just
[1:19:03] stay in egypt
[1:19:06] oh we're gonna be all things to all men
[1:19:07] hold on
[1:19:09] hold on you got to be careful how you
[1:19:11] take that does that mean i just you know
[1:19:13] drink it up with the boys oh but i'm
[1:19:16] bringing all things to all men
[1:19:17] now hold on they're going to see
[1:19:19] something different
[1:19:20] and it's not us looking down our noses
[1:19:22] at people that's not the different but
[1:19:24] they should be able to see a life that's
[1:19:25] different
[1:19:26] why are you happy why do you have peace
[1:19:27] why do you have contentment why what's
[1:19:29] going on
[1:19:30] oh is it because of a bottle though is
[1:19:32] it because of something i shoot in my
[1:19:33] veins no
[1:19:33] something i smoke no some some some tv
[1:19:36] netflix or something no none of that
[1:19:38] stuff it's because of him
[1:19:40] and if there's anything in them that
[1:19:42] wants it they'll begin to get thirsty
[1:19:45] hallelujah but you see pharaoh's heart
[1:19:47] was hardened
[1:19:48] because his sorcerers did the same thing
[1:19:52] amen so the conditioning
[1:19:55] the conditioning of pharaoh's heart was
[1:19:58] because of make believers in his in his
[1:19:59] camp
[1:20:00] if they were amen but moses moses
[1:20:04] um what do you call it objective was to
[1:20:06] get the people into the promised land
[1:20:09] right but the other others just wanted
[1:20:10] to keep them in egypt
[1:20:12] but his heart was hardened by that
[1:20:16] you know the devil will never point us
[1:20:18] to the genuine
[1:20:21] he never puts a real believer on a
[1:20:22] pedestal says look this is what the
[1:20:24] blood does
[1:20:25] never ever ever no what's what's always
[1:20:29] in the paper
[1:20:30] some scandal some pedophilia thing
[1:20:34] some horrible terrible thing that should
[1:20:36] never have happened
[1:20:37] you know in some church or something
[1:20:38] some pastor does something the catholic
[1:20:40] church does this or whatever you know
[1:20:42] all this
[1:20:42] historical horrible stuff what does it
[1:20:44] do
[1:20:46] it hardens the heart of the people
[1:20:48] because they
[1:20:49] what they do is they take that and they
[1:20:51] just say all christians are like that
[1:20:54] amen but it's never it's never ever in
[1:20:57] the paper
[1:20:58] someone from a wrecked up life meets the
[1:21:00] lord jesus christ
[1:21:02] and now they have peace now they have
[1:21:04] joy now they're content in their life
[1:21:05] now they're happy
[1:21:08] i've never read that i never go on stuff
[1:21:10] and that's the front page news
[1:21:11] no it's about glory avail or something
[1:21:13] that you know something and people just
[1:21:15] say oh that's just that that's just all
[1:21:17] this stuff's about
[1:21:18] it isn't yeah that's right that is just
[1:21:20] a
[1:21:21] a fake something for the devil to throw
[1:21:24] out there saying this is how it is
[1:21:26] and it and unfortunately it's come it is
[1:21:28] within the message itself too
[1:21:31] amen why because people have been like
[1:21:33] the 400 prophets
[1:21:35] their spirit is conditioned by the word
[1:21:38] and they try and live a holy life amen
[1:21:41] that's why people it's amazing you see
[1:21:43] things come and go
[1:21:45] and and it probably still is quite
[1:21:48] prevalent but you know
[1:21:49] the lord told brother brown that that
[1:21:51] that evidence of the new birth is you
[1:21:53] can receive the word for your day but
[1:21:56] what life is being produced
[1:21:58] the fruit of the spirit is still there
[1:22:00] that verse did not become null and void
[1:22:02] because the lord showed him that
[1:22:04] right so there's got to be a life amen
[1:22:06] there's got to be a life living
[1:22:08] not us trying to manufacture something
[1:22:10] it just lives something just pulsates
[1:22:12] out of us hell of joy comes out peace
[1:22:15] love long suffering goodness faith
[1:22:16] gentleness meekness hallelujah all those
[1:22:18] things just come out of the life
[1:22:20] why because you've really met the lord
[1:22:22] but people who could never
[1:22:24] actually surrender their lives
[1:22:25] completely said oh no
[1:22:27] it's just receiving the word for the day
[1:22:29] hold on
[1:22:31] it is but if that's not then what is the
[1:22:33] manifestation of that
[1:22:36] christian life fruit of the spirit
[1:22:39] amen so unfortunately it's even of
[1:22:42] course within the message because we're
[1:22:43] not exempt we're still people not
[1:22:44] everyone
[1:22:45] actually has the new birth right
[1:22:49] i'm glad i didn't hear hallelujah to
[1:22:50] that one now taking sides with jesus
[1:22:53] see there's many times that a minister
[1:22:55] will make a mistake and if he comes into
[1:22:56] a neighborhood a precious brother
[1:22:58] who's trying to do what's right and lead
[1:23:00] the people to right
[1:23:01] everything that the devil can point to
[1:23:03] the unbeliever or the so-called
[1:23:04] christian in that neighborhood to throw
[1:23:06] off on that man he'll do it
[1:23:09] conditioning conditioning
[1:23:12] why is there not why is there not a
[1:23:14] genuine revival
[1:23:17] even you take after yeah yeah you know 9
[1:23:19] 11 in the states churches were full
[1:23:22] then they were emptied again why because
[1:23:25] the problem is as christianity's come to
[1:23:27] a place
[1:23:29] where it's just join a church just like
[1:23:30] brother ram says put your name on a book
[1:23:32] join a church be a good church member
[1:23:34] that's not christianity that's joining a
[1:23:36] club
[1:23:38] right you can join shekinah tabernacle
[1:23:40] club there's no membership forms but you
[1:23:42] can join it in your mind
[1:23:44] i'm a believer i come here my family
[1:23:46] comes here my friends come here
[1:23:47] they're nice people that's just joining
[1:23:49] a club don't ever join a club
[1:23:53] meet the lord jesus yourself let him
[1:23:55] change you
[1:23:57] and then you've joined the right club
[1:23:59] and you don't join it you're born into
[1:24:00] it it's just like little william there i
[1:24:03] didn't ask him do you want to be brought
[1:24:04] into my family
[1:24:06] no he's born into it images like brother
[1:24:09] ram says you know i've been at brandon
[1:24:10] however many years no one asked me to
[1:24:12] join the family i was born into it
[1:24:13] it's the same thing with the family of
[1:24:15] god we don't join it we're birthed
[1:24:17] amen into the family of god amen
[1:24:20] hallelujah but there's a different kind
[1:24:23] of conditioning just like mackay
[1:24:24] we we spoke about
[1:24:28] and that's when the holy ghost grips a
[1:24:30] soul that's where i
[1:24:31] kind of want to plow on through but now
[1:24:33] because i beat on the other side now
[1:24:35] let's come to what really what we want
[1:24:36] to be
[1:24:36] or what we already are many of us amen
[1:24:40] behold the woman of canaan came out of
[1:24:41] the same coast and cried unto him saying
[1:24:44] have mercy on me o lord thou son of
[1:24:46] david my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:24:48] with the devil
[1:24:49] now this woman had a need but
[1:24:52] she wasn't just conditioned in her body
[1:24:54] or in her spirit
[1:24:55] she is conditioned in her soul because
[1:24:57] if your soul is conditioned real faith
[1:24:59] is in there
[1:25:00] nothing can stop that faith from
[1:25:02] reaching its destination
[1:25:04] no discouragement amen no trouble
[1:25:08] no no trying to be put off faith will
[1:25:10] pierce all through that
[1:25:12] and we'll get what it needs amen so so
[1:25:14] here was this woman
[1:25:16] cries out oh lord thou son of david my
[1:25:18] fa my daughter is grievously vexed with
[1:25:21] the devil
[1:25:21] but he answered not a word and his
[1:25:23] disciples came and besought him
[1:25:25] saying send her away for she crieth
[1:25:28] after us
[1:25:28] so she comes to the master think about
[1:25:32] this
[1:25:32] she comes to the living word himself and
[1:25:35] says i have this need
[1:25:36] she knew he could do it yes does he come
[1:25:39] back
[1:25:39] straight away and say what is your need
[1:25:42] ignores her flat
[1:25:44] now he's actually proving her faith
[1:25:47] god is going to prove your conditioning
[1:25:51] storms will come storms will go water
[1:25:53] will beat against the house but if you
[1:25:54] built it wisely it's upon the rock of
[1:25:56] revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:25:58] amen so it'll stand amen hallelujah
[1:26:03] now answered not a word but he answered
[1:26:06] and said i am not sent
[1:26:07] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:26:08] israel i'm not even saying to you
[1:26:12] now how many people would that throw off
[1:26:15] then came sheen worshipped him saying
[1:26:17] lord help me yes
[1:26:19] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:26:21] take the children's bread and cast it to
[1:26:23] dogs
[1:26:24] he just called the woman a dog how many
[1:26:27] people would that throw off but you see
[1:26:29] her conditioning wasn't in her emotional
[1:26:30] realm
[1:26:31] it was actually a faith revelation right
[1:26:35] it wasn't a human
[1:26:36] faith it was actually she knew if she
[1:26:38] just got to him
[1:26:39] it's going to be fine it wasn't i hope
[1:26:41] this works let's see how this happens no
[1:26:43] no no
[1:26:44] she knew it was already revealed get to
[1:26:46] the master
[1:26:47] let him speak the word and it's done
[1:26:49] that's a real conditioning in the soul
[1:26:52] amen and she said truth lord yet the
[1:26:56] dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
[1:26:58] the master's table
[1:27:00] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[1:27:02] woman greatest thy faith
[1:27:04] amen beard unto thee even as thou will
[1:27:06] and her daughter was made whole from
[1:27:08] that very hour why because her soul was
[1:27:11] conditioned
[1:27:12] there's no deviation it's just faith
[1:27:15] faith knew i must get to the master
[1:27:16] didn't matter what he said i mean you're
[1:27:18] a dog it's not meat you've not come to
[1:27:20] i've not even come to minister unto you
[1:27:22] oh lord help me
[1:27:23] even the dogs get the crumbs that fall
[1:27:25] down i'll take anything i can
[1:27:27] i mean and she and she got what she
[1:27:29] needed by just by getting some crumbs
[1:27:32] i mean if a little bit of crumbs can
[1:27:33] fall we can just get some crumbs how
[1:27:35] much for a whole loaf of the word
[1:27:37] harlow how much for a whole loaf amen
[1:27:40] amen but her faith was perseverant
[1:27:43] because she wasn't conditioned in her
[1:27:44] spirit realm
[1:27:46] in her mind in her body it was in her
[1:27:48] soul
[1:27:49] it was revealed to her i just got to get
[1:27:51] to him
[1:27:53] hallelujah amen
[1:27:57] micaiah was condition in his soul
[1:28:00] elijah the same way the apostles were
[1:28:03] the same way
[1:28:03] all the believers down through the ages
[1:28:05] were conditioned by the word of god and
[1:28:07] the word of god alone
[1:28:09] amen we've got to be the same kind of
[1:28:12] way
[1:28:12] i mean we can't be rejoicing because
[1:28:15] everything's just going fine
[1:28:16] remember faith is not a mental frame of
[1:28:18] mind
[1:28:19] it's not a mental frame of mind oh i
[1:28:21] believe because i can think clearly
[1:28:22] about it no
[1:28:23] faith is a revelation faith has revealed
[1:28:26] you it's going to happen
[1:28:27] hallelujah so we can't just be caught up
[1:28:29] in our conditioning our mind saying well
[1:28:31] if i keep all the thoughts away and i
[1:28:33] keep all the trouble away and i just
[1:28:34] focus mentally on the word it's good to
[1:28:37] do that
[1:28:38] but it's got to go beyond that into your
[1:28:40] heart
[1:28:42] is everyone with me amen we want to be
[1:28:44] conditioned
[1:28:46] highly by the word of god
[1:28:50] amen now to be transformed is to be
[1:28:54] changed and to make something different
[1:28:56] it's like a tadpole is transformed from
[1:28:58] a tadpole to a frog see
[1:28:59] once he looked like a catfish he swims
[1:29:01] around he's got a head
[1:29:02] and his tail and everything looks just
[1:29:04] like a catfish then after a while he
[1:29:06] begins to
[1:29:07] to lose he loses the tail and he's
[1:29:09] transformed from one specie to another
[1:29:12] and i think that's um and i think that's
[1:29:14] what the apostle paul must have had in
[1:29:16] mind when he said be
[1:29:17] transformed by the renewing let's see
[1:29:20] let me
[1:29:21] get that right be not conformed you know
[1:29:23] what conformed is
[1:29:25] i'll say be not be not conditioned
[1:29:28] by this world to this world but be
[1:29:31] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:29:33] renewing of your mind the things that
[1:29:35] you once thought upon to be precious
[1:29:37] lay that aside and be transformed to
[1:29:40] something
[1:29:40] else what you was one time to what you
[1:29:44] are now
[1:29:44] see by the renewing of your mind that
[1:29:47] you might prove
[1:29:48] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:29:51] will of god that's from the power of
[1:29:53] transformation
[1:29:55] are you with me this is what we need to
[1:29:57] be
[1:29:58] conditioned by the right thing not be
[1:30:01] conditioned by a group
[1:30:04] not be conditioned by you know just by a
[1:30:07] church
[1:30:07] remember we don't have a relationship to
[1:30:09] the lord through the church
[1:30:11] we have relay we have a relationship to
[1:30:12] the lord through his word
[1:30:14] because he has his word amen we're going
[1:30:16] to be conditioned we're going to
[1:30:17] condition our children the right way
[1:30:19] where to condition ourselves even even
[1:30:21] how we think
[1:30:22] we can you know it's not just children
[1:30:24] that are going to be conditioned the
[1:30:25] right way us
[1:30:25] adults we can condition our minds to
[1:30:28] think lazy
[1:30:30] right we can condition our minds not to
[1:30:31] feel anything not to be emotionally
[1:30:33] attached
[1:30:34] we can condition ourselves if we let
[1:30:36] things affect us the wrong way
[1:30:38] we can condition our thinking that it's
[1:30:39] always negative
[1:30:42] you're with me amen but in the same time
[1:30:46] that's the negative side but on the
[1:30:47] positive side we can actually condition
[1:30:49] our minds to be positive
[1:30:52] amen that we are actually taught all
[1:30:54] things are possible to them that believe
[1:30:56] how there is nothing impossible with you
[1:30:58] whatever ye say
[1:30:59] when you believe speak unto your
[1:31:01] mountain it shall be cast into the sea
[1:31:02] and if you believe it shall be done i
[1:31:05] mean this is what this word has come to
[1:31:06] do
[1:31:07] make a people that are conditioned by
[1:31:08] the by the word of god itself
[1:31:10] that doesn't matter what's going on in
[1:31:12] the world they can stand true
[1:31:15] hallelujah amen when
[1:31:18] you know you know when when brother bram
[1:31:20] saw the preview of the bride and i'll
[1:31:22] just i'll just close with this
[1:31:24] he saw them robed in in the lord's
[1:31:26] righteousness
[1:31:27] this is the bride in the beginning and
[1:31:29] the end and the marching in step
[1:31:31] onward christian soldier marching as to
[1:31:35] war
[1:31:36] they're all walking in line they're
[1:31:38] being conditioned by
[1:31:39] a voice and they are following that
[1:31:42] voice
[1:31:43] but then some of them which are in
[1:31:45] european garb which is interesting
[1:31:47] but won't go into that they were
[1:31:49] beginning to look at where the other
[1:31:50] church was going
[1:31:52] and they were actually getting out of
[1:31:54] step because they were looking at two
[1:31:55] different things at the same time
[1:31:58] so that would be conditioned by what the
[1:32:00] others were doing
[1:32:01] yeah and then brother ram is standing
[1:32:04] screaming stay in line stay in line
[1:32:06] he found himself come to something stay
[1:32:07] in line why because he saw
[1:32:10] he saw the value of staying in line
[1:32:13] hallelujah
[1:32:13] and that's why we've got to say we've
[1:32:15] received a voice in this day
[1:32:17] this message you say well it was
[1:32:19] preached 50 years ago it applies now
[1:32:22] what he said then is more current now
[1:32:24] than it was then
[1:32:25] way more current you want to read
[1:32:27] today's newspaper amen go listen to the
[1:32:29] message
[1:32:31] and it will show you what's going on in
[1:32:32] the world it's going on right now
[1:32:34] amen because what it does is you say
[1:32:36] that's just the veneer
[1:32:38] what do you see in the newspaper but
[1:32:39] what's the spirit behind it
[1:32:41] that's what i want to know because you
[1:32:43] if you see the spirit behind it then you
[1:32:44] can actually say
[1:32:45] well that's god that's not of god that's
[1:32:47] god that's not of god i mean but if you
[1:32:49] just look at the veneer you can be
[1:32:50] swayed by things
[1:32:52] and there's so many voices in this day i
[1:32:55] want to stay in line
[1:32:57] and then you go to the message and say
[1:32:58] oh so that's the veneer in the news but
[1:33:00] this is the spirit behind it
[1:33:02] hallelujah and that's everything we're
[1:33:04] in an election year
[1:33:06] it's a lolly scramble right now if we if
[1:33:09] you elect us
[1:33:10] you know for some reason i found myself
[1:33:12] in the student council intermediate
[1:33:13] school
[1:33:14] it's the same thing we want to do this
[1:33:17] let's have a skate day let's do this you
[1:33:19] know
[1:33:19] we'll do this and promises and
[1:33:23] you know anyway but we're going to stay
[1:33:28] we've received a vindicated word in this
[1:33:30] hour
[1:33:31] right and it's conditioning us
[1:33:35] it doesn't matter what happens around we
[1:33:37] can just keep walking
[1:33:39] what are you doing brother ben i'm
[1:33:40] walking i feel like traveling
[1:33:43] on i feel like traveling on hallelujah
[1:33:47] amen what have you been conditioned by
[1:33:49] by the lord himself
[1:33:51] hallelujah we're looking for mackays in
[1:33:53] this day remember
[1:33:54] in mackay's day the prophet had gone off
[1:33:56] the scene
[1:33:58] it was now that bride group standing
[1:33:59] there he was that bride group
[1:34:02] right and i believe i'm looking at those
[1:34:04] kind of people
[1:34:06] aren't you glad you can just look into
[1:34:08] the word of god and you can identify
[1:34:10] this is what's going on in this hour
[1:34:12] but it's not just those things going on
[1:34:14] in this hour there's a rapture
[1:34:16] what's happening in the church at the
[1:34:17] moment there's a swarming so brother
[1:34:19] talks about the ducks
[1:34:21] you know they begin to swarm before they
[1:34:23] migrate you know the spirit begins to
[1:34:24] move a bit more though once maybe
[1:34:26] indifferent on their nest but now
[1:34:27] they're on the pond and they're quacking
[1:34:29] around and you know they're getting
[1:34:30] excited why because the
[1:34:32] season's changing the season it's
[1:34:34] getting a bit warmer you know the
[1:34:35] coldness of the church is going out
[1:34:37] around the world there's a warmth coming
[1:34:39] in the sunlight you feel the sunlight on
[1:34:41] your
[1:34:42] on your face now of the s-o-n
[1:34:45] that that that you never felt before in
[1:34:46] the wintertime because now it's
[1:34:48] springtime hallelujah
[1:34:50] you know so now now there's a now
[1:34:52] there's a change going on
[1:34:54] and there's a swarming going on
[1:34:57] hallelujah
[1:34:58] yes i i don't believe i'm just talking
[1:35:00] pie in the sky i believe it's really
[1:35:01] happening
[1:35:02] hallelujah and so but what's the
[1:35:04] swarming for
[1:35:05] we're going to take a flight we're going
[1:35:08] to take a flight
[1:35:09] you know the most conditioned uh the
[1:35:12] most conditioned vehicle
[1:35:14] in the world is a spaceship the most
[1:35:17] conditioned
[1:35:18] is a spaceship they it has to be perfect
[1:35:22] they can just have a minute floor in the
[1:35:25] thing and once it gets to a certain
[1:35:27] height it just goes boof
[1:35:29] and it can be just a simple thing is not
[1:35:31] right it just explodes
[1:35:34] now do you know we live in an astronaut
[1:35:35] age
[1:35:37] we are the spiritual astronauts of this
[1:35:40] of this age we live in
[1:35:41] we don't live in an airplane age we live
[1:35:43] in an astronaut age
[1:35:44] so what's all the conditioning going on
[1:35:46] to get ready for our flight
[1:35:49] amen what does the astronaut do he
[1:35:51] actually just sits there
[1:35:52] but he's had pre-flight training right
[1:35:56] he knows where he's going he knows the
[1:35:58] mission plan
[1:36:00] right he you know he's you know he's got
[1:36:02] into a lot of schooling or she's got
[1:36:03] through a lot of schooling
[1:36:04] and she's ready and then all the
[1:36:06] technicians are looking at the gauges
[1:36:08] and the weather and the atmosphere and
[1:36:10] you know is the atmosphere just right
[1:36:11] can he fly just now
[1:36:12] you know if it's not they don't fly they
[1:36:14] delay and you know so the atmosphere's
[1:36:16] got to be right
[1:36:17] and they check all the gauges of all the
[1:36:19] fuel and everything's got to be just
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:21] and that's why we come to church i heard
[1:36:23] brother donnie reagan said this or i
[1:36:24] like it he says you know i love
[1:36:26] love gage is it on full is the malicion
[1:36:29] empty
[1:36:29] is the unbelief on empty as the faith on

[1:36:48] countdown
[1:36:50] you know what we're waiting for ignition
[1:36:53] brother and preached the countdown went
[1:36:54] from seven to zero
[1:36:56] from the ephesian age down to the later
[1:36:58] cnn age and what's after zero ignition
[1:37:01] and where are we ignition the law has

[1:37:18] man and we're not going to the moon
[1:37:19] we're going to glory
[1:37:21] hallelujah but are you conditioned
[1:37:25] in your soul to go
[1:37:31] and i just want to i want to leave it
[1:37:32] there i can't tell you if you're
[1:37:35] conditioned
[1:37:36] i can't tell you if you're not
[1:37:37] conditioned it's an individual walk
[1:37:39] you say but i'm just a young person no
[1:37:41] you can still be conditioned to walk
[1:37:44] remember we and i think maybe maybe i'll
[1:37:46] go into it next time
[1:37:47] are we preparing the road
[1:37:50] for them oh we preparing them for the
[1:37:53] road
[1:37:54] because if we are just preparing them uh
[1:37:57] the road for them
[1:37:59] the first time a truck comes
[1:38:03] because they're not prepared and whose
[1:38:05] fault is it the parents
[1:38:07] and even we can get older not be con you
[1:38:09] know we cannot be prepared for going
[1:38:10] through middle age
[1:38:13] right we could not be prepared for going
[1:38:15] through into older age
[1:38:18] you know we cannot be prepared and then
[1:38:21] because
[1:38:22] he'll get mid-life crisis what is that
[1:38:26] that person wasn't conditioned they
[1:38:28] weren't prepared for the road
[1:38:30] but now when you're an adult it's your
[1:38:32] responsibility it's not the parents it's
[1:38:34] now it's you
[1:38:36] so maybe we'll go into that next time
[1:38:37] but i just want you to ask that question
[1:38:39] put that question in your mind if i'm a
[1:38:42] parent am i
[1:38:42] preparing them for the road or the road
