[19:27] We have a few teachers who have been
[19:29] teaching, but um they have been learning
[19:30] a lesson about walking with the Lord and
[19:33] they have a verse that they're going to
[19:35] say to you and I hope you'll be blessed
[19:37] after that. They'll sing a song [music]
[19:38] and it's just all about walking with the
[19:40] Lord. We got the inspiration from the
[19:41] camp. Thank you, pastor. And um our
[19:44] desire is to walk with the Lord.

[25:15] They say [music] sometimes
[25:20] [singing]
[25:23] [music]
[25:26] right now
[25:28] [music]
[25:29] [singing]
[25:30] I'm losing
[25:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:37] &gt;&gt; I've stood on [singing] this stage
[25:40] of nighten
[25:47] right now.
[25:51] [music]
[25:51] I just can't.
[25:58] It's [music] easy [singing] to sing when
[26:00] there's nothing to bring me down.
[26:08] What will I say [singing] when [music]
[26:10] I'm held to the flame like I am right
[26:16] now?
[26:18] I know you're able and [singing] I know
[26:22] you can [music]
[26:24] say through the fire with your mighty
[26:27] hand. But even if you don't,
[26:33] my hope [music and singing] is you
[26:36] alone.
[26:47] [music]
[26:48] They say
[26:52] to move [singing] a mountain,
[26:59] [music]
[27:01] a little [singing] faith is all I have
[27:06] right [singing] now.
[27:09] God, when you choose to leave mountains
[27:12] [singing and music] unable,
[27:17] [music]
[27:19] give me the [singing] strength to be
[27:22] able to sing. It is well with
[27:27] [singing and music] my soul.
[27:30] I know you're able [singing] and I know
[27:33] you [music] can
[27:35] save through the fire with your
[27:37] [singing] mighty head. [music]
[27:39] But even if you [singing] don't,
[27:44] my hope is you alone.
[27:50] my own sorrow and I know the hurt would
[27:55] all go away [singing] if you just say
[27:58] the word. But even if [singing]
[28:02] you don't, [music]
[28:04] my hope is [singing] you alone.
[28:11] [music]
[28:19] [music]
[28:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[28:29] &gt;&gt; You've been faithful.
[28:32] You've been
[28:36] all my days.
[28:39] Jesus, I will
[28:44] you. [music]
[28:48] I know you're ready. [music]
[28:53] I know you can.
[28:59] I know you're able and I know you can
[29:04] stay through the fire with your mighty
[29:07] hand. But even if [music] you don't,
[29:13] my hope is you alone.
[29:17] Oh, I know the sorrow and [music] I know
[29:22] the hurt would all go away if you
[29:25] [music] just say the word. [singing]
[29:28] But even if [music] you don't,
[29:33] my hope is you alone.
[29:57] It is well
[30:01] with my soul.
[30:06] It is well.
[30:10] It is well.
[30:17] My [music] soul.
[31:13] song that I'm going to sing. I started
[31:16] writing it
[31:18] I think five months before camp
[31:22] and the goal was to have it ready and so
[31:25] be done and sing it by camp. But um you
[31:29] know when you songwriting I'm not a very
[31:30] good songwriter but um when you're
[31:33] songwriting you I personally you know I
[31:36] have a session set aside you know I'll
[31:38] pray pray for inspiration and um the
[31:41] words just come and um I only got like
[31:44] the first verse and the chorus and the
[31:46] bridge done over a course of two days
[31:50] and then just blank completely nothing.
[31:52] I couldn't get anything. And so it was
[31:55] sad like I couldn't finish it. But then
[31:56] about uh 3 weeks ago already in
[31:59] Australia, I was able to finish it. I
[32:03] had a session. I prayed. I said, "Lord,
[32:05] I really like to finish this song." And
[32:06] then the rest of the song came to me and
[32:10] I was able to finish it. So I just hope
[32:12] it's a blessing to you all.
[32:47] I see this one.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[33:23] &gt;&gt; When I was [music] a child, you were in
[33:26] my heart.
[33:28] [music]
[33:29] You were my everything.
[33:32] You showed me a life where I wouldn't
[33:36] [singing] live
[33:38] without you by my side. You made
[33:42] miracles [music] which seemed
[33:44] impossible.
[33:47] Healing [singing]
[33:48] in the night.
[33:51] You, oh God, can do anything. [singing]

[34:35] There were times that I wondered far
[34:38] from you.
[34:41] Still you called [singing] me home. You
[34:44] lifted up my head when I lost hope.
[34:50] You held my trembling heart. Put [music]
[34:54] peace into storms that rocked my boat.
[34:58] You surrounded me with your love.

[37:57] the praises. We dedicate
[38:01] our lives
[38:03] to you. My everything.
[38:23] Amen. God bless you. Um then we have two
[38:26] testimonies. We'll start off with
[38:29] brother Paul I believe
[38:32] it and then uh then we'll have no
[38:42] God bless you saints. I greet you all in
[38:45] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; I I want to be on the same level with
[38:49] you not up there. So I try my best to be
[38:54] short as possible
[38:57] and normally a person like me, you don't
[38:59] give them a mic before the service. So
[39:03] I'm happy to see each one of you. Just a
[39:07] a it's not a quick testimony, but I'll
[39:11] try to compress it. Um we we we
[39:16] decided and we unfortunately left
[39:19] Shakina
[39:21] sadly and went to to P. But I thought
[39:28] I thought when we sat down with sister
[39:29] Christine and brother Ben for coffee and
[39:31] we were talking about this thing this
[39:32] thought I thought I knew everything and
[39:36] planned out but I didn't realize I
[39:39] didn't know. So I came here seven years
[39:43] ago with my family and we were led to be
[39:46] here in so many confirmations that the
[39:50] Lord led us to be here. We didn't know
[39:52] these people before just read them on
[39:55] internet and the testimonies that
[39:57] inspired us then the Lord opened the
[39:58] way. So fast track seven years later I I
[40:04] have this family uh that was so
[40:06] wonderful to me from from point number
[40:09] one the minute I arrived at the airport
[40:11] and you all know our our relationship
[40:15] and our history together right now but
[40:18] all the time when I came here I was
[40:21] concerned why I'm not getting the job
[40:25] which I was trained for which was more
[40:27] in finance budgets government. I'm a
[40:30] typical public servant if you know
[40:34] that's all I did all my life working in
[40:37] government seeing how politicians eat
[40:40] money or use it
[40:43] &gt;&gt; and helping them to do that or not to do
[40:46] that.
[40:48] So I was concerned and I spoke to
[40:50] brother Ben a few times why what is it
[40:54] that I must do and of course as a father
[40:57] I have to provide. So I had to get jobs
[41:00] and still in the government but more
[41:02] customer service and I felt some way
[41:04] that this is not taking me where I want
[41:06] to go career-wise
[41:10] and then
[41:12] man time went by I was starting to be
[41:16] comfortable ah that's the line I'll take
[41:18] maybe that's where the Lord wants me but
[41:20] I knew that I've invested so much in
[41:24] this direction of finance and I like it
[41:26] but I'm not getting there. Okay.
[41:30] Uh, citizenship came. We never thought
[41:34] about Australia. We've always had
[41:36] positive things, thoughts about
[41:38] Australia, but I never imagined myself
[41:40] there. Suddenly,
[41:43] I remembered before New Zealand and even
[41:45] our thoughts going to Canada came.
[41:47] Australia was featuring, but I've always
[41:50] perceived it differently.
[41:53] Now we got a citizenship and ah one day
[41:56] I said to my wife ah why don't you go to
[41:58] Australia maybe I'll go I'll get a job
[42:00] and then we started to be human and have
[42:03] thoughts [clears throat]
[42:04] oh we can do this oh we can we can money
[42:08] we can do that but we didn't realize
[42:10] that it's not about that it's actually
[42:12] not about money or my career my worry in
[42:16] other words my worry or my concern
[42:20] I don't want to be hard on myself but
[42:22] before the Lord was actually baseless
[42:26] because that that's the last thing that
[42:28] will worry the Lord.
[42:30] And why I'm saying that is because
[42:32] actually my father, he's not he's not
[42:36] limited to what he can give me, but he's
[42:39] got a bigger vision, a bigger plan, a
[42:41] bigger idea than what I think my ideas
[42:45] are.
[42:47] Spoke to Sister Christina and brother
[42:49] Ben and they said, "Ah, we're just
[42:51] having a friendly heart and you know
[42:53] when you just so comfortable with each
[42:55] other and say ah that way that way then
[42:57] eventually we landed with the idea of
[43:00] path
[43:02] I can I can without fear of
[43:04] contradiction called sister Christine
[43:07] she said hey me I didn't feel
[43:08] comfortable when I walked into that city
[43:10] of Sydney I said hey I said that's where
[43:14] the money is said I didn't
[43:17] I said ah sister maybe the Lord is
[43:19] leading you I'm not going to Sydney
[43:22] first take in quickly we we
[43:25] left I got a job my wife got a job first
[43:29] at a company and then I didn't get any
[43:33] not even an invite for an interview but
[43:36] later on I when she got a job she just
[43:39] spoke to this HR person who said h I see
[43:42] you guys are hiring me but my husband
[43:43] applied for a job there but you guys
[43:45] declined him
[43:48] said oh is that so said okay give me CV.
[43:51] Then she forwarded my CV. Few days later
[43:54] they called me. I said, "Ah, these
[43:56] people, what kind of people are these?"
[43:58] They called me for an interview. I went
[44:02] on teams online.
[44:05] 30 minutes later, they offered me a job
[44:07] same day and it never happened to me. I
[44:09] said, "Lord, is this you
[44:13] or not?" But that was not nothing to do
[44:15] with finance, still customer service. I
[44:18] went, you know, I left here and
[44:21] everything. The kids came later, joined
[44:23] my wife, started a job. And then before
[44:26] I left here, I received another call
[44:28] from a government department for a a
[44:30] finance position that was more entry
[44:33] level
[44:35] to build myself up. I got an an invite
[44:39] and I said to them, I'm not in town. You
[44:42] know, I'm out of town. What I meant was
[44:44] I'm not in P.
[44:47] and I didn't want to tell them that I
[44:48] don't live there yet. So I just said I'm
[44:50] not in town. Can I postpone the date
[44:52] knowing that I'm starting the other job
[44:54] so I'll be there? So they said okay
[44:56] fine. 16th October we agreed. I left
[44:59] yesterday a job 16th of October I went
[45:02] for that interview and I was working
[45:04] this other company with my wife doing
[45:06] customer call and customers and
[45:08] everything. So I went for that interview
[45:12] of finance analyst. Let's say it was and
[45:15] and just Please understand me. This is
[45:17] not about the job. It's about seeing God
[45:20] in what I'm trying to tell you. It's not
[45:22] really about I'm not trying to to be
[45:24] anything because I'm nothing. So let's
[45:28] say this is role at a position level X
[45:32] as the lowest. So I got an interview. I
[45:35] go I said man if I get this one I'll
[45:37] build myself up. Go for an interview.
[45:40] Interview as well. According to me,
[45:43] three people, senior manager, two other
[45:45] junior managers.
[45:47] I went two weeks later, they are not
[45:49] coming back to me. I found the agent who
[45:51] was doing recruitment. He says, "No,
[45:53] Samson, it looks positive. They will
[45:55] call you." Nothing. Third week, they
[45:58] don't call me. I called them. Then then
[46:01] I just received an email. deadline
[46:06] but she said positive but I'm deadline
[46:09] I've got an email I can show you
[46:11] deadline we will may call you in the
[46:14] next 12 months if there's any suitable
[46:16] job I thought it was positive I thought
[46:18] this is my entry level no I left started
[46:23] to be resilient and continue with the
[46:25] customer job and see what the Lord wants
[46:29] the same evening the manager who was in
[46:31] the interview called me and said Hey
[46:33] Samson, let's not talk about the
[46:36] interview and what happened. I want to
[46:38] offer you a job because I know you can
[46:40] do it.
[46:43] That got me thinking. You want to offer
[46:45] me a job? But I got a decline. Yeah.
[46:47] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. I'm going
[46:49] to offer you a contract.
[46:51] I'm going to offer you a contract for 6
[46:53] months as if and then after that I'll
[46:57] fix up things. You can be appointed
[46:58] permanently or long term. I'm shocked.
[47:02] But I'm happy. So I talk to those guys
[47:05] where I'm working with my wife. Honey,
[47:07] sorry I'm leaving you. I negotiate in
[47:10] two weeks time leave. I start a job at
[47:12] the government department, local
[47:14] government. I say, okay, now let's see
[47:16] how this thing goes. I start I'm
[47:18] enjoying I'm starting to think back in
[47:20] South Africa when I used to do budgets
[47:22] in government. I can feel the government
[47:24] atmosphere. I'm feeling ah this is good.
[47:27] That's what I like. I I want to do so.
[47:29] So from here I must just grow. I tell
[47:31] brother Ben, man, I got a job. I'm
[47:32] studying as a finance analyst. He said,
[47:35] oh, but that guy did not offer me the
[47:37] finance analyst job at level X that I
[47:40] failed in the interview. He said, I'm
[47:42] offering this contract at the level Y.
[47:46] I thought I failed in interview. I'm
[47:48] offering at a level Y now going high
[47:53] or for me it meant extra money. So, I
[47:55] was excited.
[47:57] I'm a I'm human.
[47:59] So this guy said, "Ah, then I didn't
[48:03] question why you're offering me at
[48:05] higher level." I just grabbed it and I
[48:07] start went on work.
[48:11] First week, second week, he calls me out
[48:15] for coffee. We are drinking coffee. This
[48:17] is a guy who's got three uh he's a
[48:20] general manager. He's got about three
[48:22] levels going down before me
[48:25] or before that job that I failed in the
[48:27] interview. So then he calls me out for
[48:30] coffee. I'm building an organization. I
[48:33] want to build a team and everything. He
[48:34] said okay look there's a job that I
[48:36] advertise. I don't know if you saw it. I
[48:39] said no. He said go to the internet
[48:41] company website check and I want you to
[48:44] apply.
[48:46] I said mate I I don't have two weeks
[48:49] here.
[48:50] I found people working here now. I'm on
[48:54] contract. I thought you were busy
[48:55] arranging after 6 months. He said, "No,
[48:58] apply."
[49:00] I said, "Okay." He said, "Closing date
[49:02] is Monday the 1st and the interview is
[49:05] on the 8th."
[49:07] How can you tell me interview on the 8th
[49:09] when I have not even been called for?
[49:11] Okay, fine. I apply. I said to my wife,
[49:13] she said, "No, apply." I did a
[49:15] half-hazard quick application with a a a
[49:18] covering letter that was even lesser
[49:20] than the first junior position I
[49:22] applied.
[49:24] And then he he got the application
[49:27] before the interview. He called me to
[49:28] his office. He say, "Hey, Samson, you
[49:30] know, I'm I'm a very straightforward
[49:32] guy. I asked you to apply, but I'm
[49:35] disappointed.
[49:36] I'm highly disappointed in you because
[49:39] your covering letter is not what I I
[49:42] expected and I knew that he's speaking
[49:45] the truth."
[49:47] So I I was sad. I said, "I'm so sorry to
[49:50] let you down, but hey." Yeah, I did it
[49:53] in a rush because this pressure with
[49:55] budget time we are busy preparing for
[49:57] the budget.
[49:59] I said, "Ah, because I'm prepared to
[50:01] take that position he gave me. I'm happy
[50:03] at level Y,
[50:05] but the Lord is not finished with me to
[50:07] show me that it's not about a job or
[50:11] money or whatever. It's about his will
[50:13] and his plan about me and my family."
[50:17] And then I was called for an interview
[50:20] in towards the end of the following week
[50:25] for the Monday before we came here.
[50:29] And I went I prepared thoroughly because
[50:31] I knew I'm already on the back footing
[50:33] with my application letter. It all I was
[50:36] almost not called. So I went but I
[50:40] didn't give myself a chance because
[50:41] that's now level X.
[50:44] Are you following me? It's not level X.
[50:46] It's not normal level Y. I failed level
[50:49] X. I was given level Y. Now he's telling
[50:53] me to apply for level X which is now a
[50:56] manager.
[50:58] Then I go. I not tell you what I said in
[51:01] that interview. I spoke for 45 minutes.
[51:05] They give me a question paper to prepare
[51:08] first and present it.
[51:10] So I went, I finished. I went back to my
[51:13] desk. Continue working.
[51:16] As I I finished and I I I was coming out
[51:19] from buying food, I meet the agent,
[51:21] recruitment lady who was in the first
[51:22] one that I failed. She says to me, "Oh,
[51:25] I'm leaving now, but just before I go,
[51:27] by the way, can I contact those refere
[51:30] referees that you gave me in the
[51:33] position that you failed in level X?" I
[51:36] said, "Yeah, those are good people. One
[51:38] is in A&Z here in New Zealand. One is my
[51:42] manager back in South Africa." I said,
[51:43] "Yeah, I'll just refresh them to expect
[51:46] your call." He said, "Good." But I said,
[51:48] "Oh, but I thought you said two weeks.
[51:51] I'll hear." And he says, "No." She says,
[51:53] "The panel is done."
[51:56] I don't know what that does mean. I
[51:57] left. I went to eat my food. I don't
[51:59] know what to think. I said to my wife,
[52:00] "I don't know what I'm thinking." She
[52:02] says, "Okay." Then I get to my office.
[52:05] Then I grab my chair to my table, but I
[52:08] didn't realize I took my boss's chair by
[52:09] mistake. We were busy moving offices. He
[52:12] comes to me say hey Buddha this is my
[52:14] chair you took my mistake because I
[52:16] didn't mark my chair everybody marked
[52:18] their chair I say sorry boss he takes
[52:21] his chair then I go to the office to
[52:23] fetch another chair
[52:25] my one was not there so I see him coming
[52:28] towards me pushing a chair which was
[52:30] mine I swapped them he comes I say oh
[52:33] yeah and he comes closer to the office
[52:35] where I was trying to pick up a chair he
[52:37] says instead of giving me a chair he
[52:38] just closed the door and I I don't you
[52:41] know, he just says to me,
[52:43] "Congratulations."
[52:46] At that moment, I don't know what to
[52:48] think, what to say. What is he talking
[52:49] about? So, I say, "Hey, what are you
[52:53] saying, Bob?" He says, "Uh, no, that's
[52:55] all I'm saying. Just keep the
[52:57] information for yourself.
[52:59] Here's your chair." Then I check the
[53:01] chair, go to the desk. I don't know what
[53:03] to think, what to say. XY Z h how is
[53:07] that possible in two weeks on a
[53:09] contract? And I found people working
[53:10] there. Then the Lord said to me, "Hey,
[53:14] it's not about a job." What we worried
[53:16] in New Zealand or fin no seven years I
[53:19] take you there. I've got a plan, a
[53:20] purpose. Why? There's nothing about your
[53:23] job when what what is a job to me? The
[53:27] Lord says to give you. You think I
[53:30] failed you?
[53:32] So I was feeling that I've disappointed
[53:35] the Lord because he is got a kettle on a
[53:40] thousand hills. There's nothing. He can
[53:43] empty heaven to bless you. But he just
[53:46] want all these things that happens
[53:47] around us physically. He want us to see
[53:51] his glory. He want us to see him through
[53:54] all those things. It's not about that
[53:56] sickness or anything. It's not about
[53:58] that. So uh he said congratulations and
[54:01] I left and I'm waiting for an official
[54:04] document now. Maybe I'll express my
[54:06] happiness better. Maybe God helped me
[54:09] that I'm not doubting him. But all I'm
[54:12] trying to say, brothers and sisters, is
[54:13] that
[54:15] God is not limited to help us or to
[54:17] provide for us. Let's pray for
[54:19] impossible things.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; As the song was going, impossible
[54:23] things. We pray for those ones because
[54:25] he showed me that it's not about the
[54:29] job.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; It's not about a finance thing. He just
[54:32] wanted to show me just two weeks that he
[54:35] can promote me to be the head of that
[54:37] government department me even if there's
[54:41] better people. Why? Because you are a
[54:44] son of God.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; You have to realize that you are a son
[54:47] of God and God thinks way way better
[54:51] than how you think about yourself.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what God did for me and my
[54:56] wife and my boys. And they are
[55:00] I must say that I'm blessed. Kira, he
[55:03] just surprises me every day. Um even his
[55:07] volume went up. God bless you for that
[55:10] song, son. So that's all I wanted to
[55:12] share with you, brothers and sisters.
[55:14] It's about God. It's not about how I
[55:17] look, but he's got a plan for you. Which
[55:20] way must you go? Whom must you meet for
[55:22] what? He knows.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[55:45] It's my one from camp. I didn't get it
[55:46] to tell it because we left the day
[55:48] after. I was kind of mad cuz I didn't
[55:50] get to tell it. Anyways, so um
[55:55] Sunday night. Yeah.
[55:56] after the preaching. So, it's like
[55:58] testimony, not my testimony, a prayer
[56:00] line that's going all around the church.
[56:03] And I had already got my fulfilling of
[56:06] the Holy Ghost 2024, right? So, there
[56:09] was nothing really for me to go up
[56:10] about. So, I was just praising in the
[56:12] audience. And then now in the audience,
[56:16] I'm just so sitting at the bro and we're
[56:18] just praising, dancing and then the line
[56:20] is almost finished and I keep on getting
[56:23] this pull to go to the front to get
[56:25] brave. I was like, what am I going to go
[56:26] for? There's nothing for me to there's
[56:28] nothing probable in my mind for me to go
[56:29] and say please pray for me. So I was
[56:32] just like, no. Five times it happened.
[56:34] Like literal almost push saying go up
[56:37] the front. I didn't know what I was
[56:38] going to say. So now on the fifth time
[56:40] it was only Andy and Brunin at the front
[56:43] and they were getting prayer and I was
[56:44] like okay go I'll go. And I going past
[56:46] Micah and I went up to the front. I was
[56:48] like I don't even know what I'm going to
[56:48] say. Okay, I'm going to Australia so
[56:50] I'll pray for that. And I said to
[56:52] brother Ben, I was like can you just
[56:54] pray for me because Before the service,
[56:56] I was kind of panicking and like
[56:58] overthinking because I don't know what's
[56:59] going to go on Australia. I don't know
[57:01] like it's a different place. I've never
[57:03] actually been there before. And then I
[57:04] was like, he just prayed for me that
[57:06] everything go well. So I didn't even
[57:07] know what's going on here, right? And
[57:09] then the words that he said to me, I
[57:12] felt it was straight from the Lord.
[57:14] That's why he wanted wanted me to go up
[57:15] there. He said,
[57:17] "Don't worry one about going to into
[57:21] uncharted waters because
[57:24] The more you put your trust in me, the
[57:26] more I'm going to lead you. The more
[57:28] that you close your eyes and just walk,
[57:32] that's the more that the Lord is going
[57:33] to take you. Because trusting in your
[57:35] own eyes and trusting in your own
[57:37] abilities to take you places, that's
[57:39] where now you're going to start falling
[57:40] and get hurt, come out with ages of
[57:42] scars. So trusting in the Lord and
[57:44] putting all your trust in him like
[57:46] completely, not worrying about anything
[57:48] that's going to happen to you, that's
[57:50] what's going to help you to get through
[57:51] on the other side correctly. Amen. God
[57:53] bless you. Amen.
[58:04] God bless you, Mo. Let's just stand and
[58:07] sing one more song before brother Ben
[58:09] comes this morning. Sing stay.
[58:23] And I know what it's like
[58:29] to be in the presence of the Lord
[58:38] and not [singing] know what time
[58:45] because [singing and music] I'm
[58:47] Still
[58:53] bies, [singing]
[59:00] &gt;&gt; the [music] families. [singing]
[59:09] Because [singing and music] we stay
[59:16] in the presence of [music] the Lord.
[59:23] Well, no one had [singing] to say a
[59:25] word.
[59:29] [music]
[59:31] You couldn't [singing] even make a
[59:33] sound.
[59:39] But I'd [singing]
[59:40] give up
[59:43] everything.
[59:46] Oh, for this [singing] treasure I found.

[1:00:24] [music]
[1:00:26] So I say stay [music and singing]
[1:00:33] cuz I don't want you to go
[1:00:37] [music]
[1:00:41] cuz my heart is burning
[1:00:49] in your presence.
[1:00:54] Please stay.
[1:00:58] So please stay. [music]

[1:08:04] So, God bless you all. Amen.
[1:08:08] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's um let's
[1:08:10] turn to the scripture uh this morning.
[1:08:12] We just go to go to Micah uh chapter 6
[1:08:16] and verses uh seven and seven and 8. And
[1:08:20] I thought it was very um timely, Sister
[1:08:23] Tabitha, you know, you how you had the
[1:08:25] song in the Sunday school, walking with
[1:08:26] God, because that's what I'm going to
[1:08:28] talk about this morning, walking with
[1:08:29] God. So, I thought that was real nice
[1:08:31] and how all the rest of the songs all
[1:08:33] tied in with this. So,
[1:08:36] amen. So, we're just going to read this
[1:08:37] here, Micah 6 and and verses 6 through8.
[1:08:39] And it and it reads like So, we have
[1:08:41] lunch afterwards as well. So, don't run
[1:08:43] away. We're going to eat together
[1:08:45] afterwards. So, you're all all very
[1:08:47] welcome to stay. And Amen. I appreciate
[1:08:50] you all. So, it says here uh wherewith
[1:08:52] shall I come before the Lord and bow
[1:08:54] down myself before the high God? Shall I
[1:08:57] come before him with burnt offerings,
[1:08:59] with calves of a year old? Will the Lord
[1:09:02] be pleased with thousands of rams or
[1:09:04] with 10,000s of rivers of oil? Shall I
[1:09:07] give my firstborn for my transgression,
[1:09:09] the fruit of my body for the sin of my
[1:09:11] soul? He hath showed thee, oh man, what
[1:09:15] is good, and what do the Lord require of
[1:09:17] thee? but to do justly and to love mercy
[1:09:21] and to walk humbly with thy God. Let's
[1:09:24] bow our heads in a word of prayer. Amen.
[1:09:26] Let's commit our lives in our this time.
[1:09:28] If you have a need, just want to slip
[1:09:30] your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me."
[1:09:32] He's a personal God. Wherever you if you
[1:09:35] invite him, he'll come to you.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we just want
[1:09:39] more of you, Lord. We want more more of
[1:09:42] you, oh God. More of your presence,
[1:09:43] Lord. Pour yourself into us, Father. We
[1:09:45] lift our cups up, Lord. We lift every
[1:09:48] need, every burden, every question.
[1:09:49] Father, I pray you come and you cleanse
[1:09:52] us of our secret faults. May you be
[1:09:53] glorified in our midst. Lord, forgive us
[1:09:55] of our sins and our wrongs. Cover us in
[1:09:57] your blood, dear God. May you be
[1:09:59] glorified in our midst. Lord, we bow our
[1:10:01] heads and say, "Thank you, Lord. You do
[1:10:03] all things very well." So, Father, as
[1:10:06] we've read your word, I pray you'd speak
[1:10:07] to our hearts. Speak to my heart, too.
[1:10:09] Be at those who are streaming who
[1:10:11] couldn't be here today. Be their
[1:10:12] abundant portion. We think of the Stro
[1:10:13] family driving north. Keep them safe on
[1:10:15] the road. We love you, Lord. We thank
[1:10:17] you for this opportunity in Jesus
[1:10:19] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[1:10:22] have your seats this morning. So, I want
[1:10:25] to speak about walking with God. And if
[1:10:28] I could put another title uh Enoch's
[1:10:31] walk. Now, we understand that the uh
[1:10:34] scripture tells us in Genesis that uh
[1:10:36] and Enoch walked with God and was not
[1:10:39] for God took him. Now, Brother Bram says
[1:10:41] that God condenses his truth. So it'll
[1:10:44] be just a phrase, but God condenses a
[1:10:47] great truth in that phrase. And even
[1:10:49] this here where God would God would ask
[1:10:51] the question, you know, what does the
[1:10:53] Lord really want? And I think very I
[1:10:56] think it's very important, especially as
[1:10:58] we're going into 2026 as, you know, the
[1:11:01] world is falling apart, but yet God is
[1:11:03] pouring himself into his believer more
[1:11:05] and more. And God's moving in great
[1:11:07] power and he's making this, you know,
[1:11:09] making the message so tangible, so alive
[1:11:11] and so real that, you know, what is the
[1:11:14] way forward, you know, because there
[1:11:16] there's always a way forward. You know,
[1:11:18] God, God did not put us in this dark age
[1:11:20] just for us to stumble along and try and
[1:11:22] find our way. He always goes before us.
[1:11:25] Amen. And so, we have supreme confidence
[1:11:27] that God and his word has given us a
[1:11:29] path forward. And so, I believe this is
[1:11:32] [laughter] really the path forward is
[1:11:33] that because what does God want? Because
[1:11:35] you think about this. This is the God,
[1:11:37] the supreme Lord God Almighty who made
[1:11:39] heaven and earth. Amen. His spoken word
[1:11:42] has made this universe. The pew you sit
[1:11:44] on is his spoken word. God made your
[1:11:46] bodies. He made all things and he's
[1:11:49] higher than the heavens. He's so He's so
[1:11:51] holy and without sin that even the
[1:11:53] angels that never fell look dirty in his
[1:11:55] sight. This how supreme this God is. And
[1:11:57] he's asking the question now, how can we
[1:11:59] approach this great God? You think about
[1:12:02] how we don't we are not veiled by
[1:12:04] tradition this morning. We don't have
[1:12:06] some humanistic way of approach. But God
[1:12:08] God has actually demolished all that
[1:12:10] nonsense. Amen. That now we can we can
[1:12:13] we can walk with a pure faith, a pure
[1:12:16] revelation and we know how to approach
[1:12:18] the Lord. This is so to me it's so
[1:12:20] amazing. Lord, how can I come to where
[1:12:22] you are? Like there's a chorus we used
[1:12:24] to sing. You know, when I could not go
[1:12:26] to where he was, you came to me. Amen.
[1:12:29] And so if he came to me, he's going to
[1:12:30] reveal a path. How do I approach him
[1:12:33] now? And so he asked the question, um,
[1:12:37] you know, is it burnt offerings? Is that
[1:12:40] really what God wants? A bunch of, you
[1:12:42] know, I'm not against praise. I'm sure
[1:12:43] you all know me enough that I'm not some
[1:12:46] stiff, starchy white guy, okay? I'm a
[1:12:48] Christian. I've been born again. Amen.
[1:12:50] So I'm not some formalistic dead bit of
[1:12:53] stump somewhere. I've got life. I mean,
[1:12:56] he found me, saved me, and I'm just
[1:12:57] extremely happy with what he's doing in
[1:12:59] my life. So, I like to express that I've
[1:13:01] got a bit of emotion, right? Brother
[1:13:03] Bram said, "Anything without emotion,
[1:13:04] you bury it and let it be raised again
[1:13:06] in newness of life." So, so it's more
[1:13:09] than just a bunch of sacrifice and
[1:13:10] praise. He doesn't really want that.
[1:13:13] Even even as it says here, is he pleased
[1:13:15] with thousands of rams or tens of
[1:13:18] thousands of rivers of oil? You know,
[1:13:20] great emotional or inspired time. See,
[1:13:23] God wants to be more than just anoint
[1:13:24] our spirit or anoint our flesh. Though
[1:13:27] he does those things, but he wants to
[1:13:28] come abide in our souls. Amen. That's
[1:13:31] that's what he's looking for. And he
[1:13:33] says this is what this is the way you
[1:13:35] must good. You know, this is the way
[1:13:36] that is good. This is what God requires
[1:13:38] of you.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; I'm glad God answers his own question,
[1:13:42] right? He says to do justly, to love
[1:13:44] mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
[1:13:47] Now, this is the key to a successful
[1:13:49] walk. I say this is the key to Enoch's
[1:13:51] walk.
[1:13:52] Amen. Now, Brother Bram says this in the
[1:13:54] message uh Satan's Eden. He says, "I
[1:13:56] wanted to speak to you something to
[1:13:58] bring something to enlighten to you the
[1:14:00] promise of God for this age. See,
[1:14:03] something not something that somebody
[1:14:05] else was in some other day, but
[1:14:07] something when them things are all
[1:14:08] right." And we all refer to those
[1:14:10] things. But I thought I would try to
[1:14:12] bring something to your mind with these
[1:14:14] scriptures I got written here that would
[1:14:16] enlighten you to know to make you a
[1:14:18] better soldier in the field that you're
[1:14:21] fighting in now. To learn the tactics of
[1:14:23] the enemy so that you can block
[1:14:25] everything before it gets to you. See,
[1:14:27] that's the main thing is to learn to
[1:14:29] keep the punches off of you as much as
[1:14:32] you can. Now, who wants to be able to do
[1:14:34] that? Amen. That you see the enemy
[1:14:36] coming. You don't you we don't have to
[1:14:38] stand there and take blows. You know,
[1:14:39] it's not like I'm sure you've halfly
[1:14:41] seen these kind of videos where these
[1:14:43] guys they they they agree to do it. They
[1:14:45] stand or they sit in front of each other
[1:14:47] and one slaps one and then the other guy
[1:14:49] has a shot and you know who's seen that
[1:14:51] kind of stuff?
[1:14:52] Some someone's honest here. I've seen
[1:14:54] it. I thought that is the most stupid
[1:14:56] contest you could ever fathom in your
[1:14:58] mind. You know, why on earth would you
[1:15:00] do that? But for some reason, we kind of
[1:15:02] think that this is how the Christian
[1:15:04] walk is, is we we give the devil one and
[1:15:07] then he and then he then he gives us one
[1:15:08] and we just have to take it. No, we can
[1:15:10] walk in this world in such a way that we
[1:15:12] can keep those punches off us before
[1:15:14] they even land. Amen. And that's what
[1:15:16] the message has done. He's opened his
[1:15:18] word to us that we can realize now I see
[1:15:20] you enemy. I see you Satan. I see your
[1:15:22] tactics. I'm going to bypass this. I
[1:15:25] mean, there's some battles you've got to
[1:15:26] go through, but there's some battles we
[1:15:28] don't have to go through. You know, we
[1:15:30] walk by faith and not by sight. So, we
[1:15:33] can we can bypass his attacks if we
[1:15:35] want.
[1:15:37] Now, some of these things, you know, we
[1:15:40] think about, you know, so so what are
[1:15:41] the punches then that we're facing
[1:15:43] today? I think it's a good question.
[1:15:46] This is this is how my brain works. You
[1:15:47] talk about the punches off of you. Okay.
[1:15:49] Well, what kind of punches am I maybe
[1:15:51] going to maybe going to be hit by? You
[1:15:53] know, it's not well, for us anyway, the
[1:15:56] punches aren't drinking, drugs, or
[1:15:58] smoking to most of us. Those aren't the
[1:16:01] things that really can knock us down.
[1:16:03] We've risen above those things.
[1:16:04] Revelation has taken us above those
[1:16:07] things, right? It's not even It's not
[1:16:09] even denominational creeds or ideas of
[1:16:11] men.
[1:16:12] We, you know, a lot of us were born in
[1:16:14] Who was born in Okay, I wasn't, but who
[1:16:16] was born in the message? Raise your
[1:16:17] hand.
[1:16:19] So, you know nothing of coming out of
[1:16:20] some religious system. you were born out
[1:16:23] of it already, right? So those punches
[1:16:25] are not punches that you need to avoid
[1:16:27] because you've already moved beyond
[1:16:29] those things, right? So, so there's
[1:16:31] things like that. It's like those aren't
[1:16:33] the punches that the devil's going to
[1:16:34] try and knock. You know, I don't have to
[1:16:36] stand here and tell you what the mark of
[1:16:37] the beast is. And sure, I'll preach
[1:16:39] those things. I feel led, but we know
[1:16:40] what it is. We're not wrestling with is
[1:16:42] is the word right or is tradition right
[1:16:44] or you know, is the message right or is
[1:16:46] it wrong. We've God has given us a
[1:16:48] revelation that we know who is who he is
[1:16:51] and Jesus Christ is his word. So those
[1:16:54] kind of punches they should be under our
[1:16:56] feet. Right. Right. So so then what
[1:16:58] would what would they be? Well the most
[1:17:02] deceptive punches are these. This is
[1:17:04] just my list. Yeah. There's far more.
[1:17:06] Pride is a punch,
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; right? A critical spirit that is backed
[1:17:12] up by quotes and scriptures. That's a
[1:17:14] terrible punch. Remember, these punches
[1:17:16] just affect you. They affect others, but
[1:17:18] they're really just beating you. We
[1:17:19] don't want a bunch of bruises by because
[1:17:21] of a critical spirit that's affecting
[1:17:22] our lives. Amen. Or making the circle
[1:17:25] smaller and smaller until eventually
[1:17:27] you're even out of it yourself.
[1:17:30] That's a punch. I'm not fellowshipping
[1:17:32] with those people, they're like this, or
[1:17:34] 10 years ago, they like that. They've
[1:17:36] grown. Have you grown? They've grown.
[1:17:39] Have they changed? You've changed. Have
[1:17:41] they got revelation? Yeah, you. Well,
[1:17:43] you have. God was gracious to you. You
[1:17:45] know, I'm sure he's been gracious to
[1:17:47] them, but so you cut them out of your
[1:17:48] circle. Your circle gets so small,
[1:17:50] you're like, "Well, I can't even live
[1:17:51] this myself." Well, you just been
[1:17:52] receiving punches for a long time. I
[1:17:54] think we should be able to wake up and
[1:17:56] say, "Hold on. This is the enemy trying
[1:17:57] to take me out. I'm going to bypass this
[1:17:59] thing."
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, a spirit of comparison is a
[1:18:04] terrible punch. comparing this church
[1:18:06] and this church and that minister and
[1:18:08] this congregation and this and you know
[1:18:10] if we compare you know Paul says if you
[1:18:13] compare yourselves among yourselves he
[1:18:14] says you're unwise
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I don't believe I'm looking at foolish
[1:18:17] virgin this morning I believe look at
[1:18:20] the wise wise virgin amen so if we're
[1:18:22] wise we don't compare every church is
[1:18:24] different if you go look at different
[1:18:27] you know we're sheep right you go look
[1:18:29] at sheep in Scotland they're different
[1:18:31] to sheep here you know sheep in
[1:18:33] Australia is different to sheep here or
[1:18:35] South Africa or anywhere there's sheep,
[1:18:37] they're all different, but they're all
[1:18:40] sheep,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; right? They even they even have have
[1:18:43] have have proven that animals have
[1:18:45] accents, not just humans. So, a sheep
[1:18:48] and you know, Australian sheeple sound
[1:18:51] Australian. It's true. They've actually
[1:18:52] people have been paid to study these
[1:18:54] things. Hey,
[1:18:57] anyway, but but they sound slightly
[1:19:00] different, but they still have a sheep
[1:19:02] nature, right? And but but they're built
[1:19:04] for those conditions.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't compare one sheep to
[1:19:09] another sheep because they're built to
[1:19:11] overcome the problems in that place.
[1:19:13] Right? It's just is the same thing with
[1:19:15] ministry. Same thing with God is a God
[1:19:17] of variety. Thank the Lord you don't all
[1:19:19] act and look like me. You can say amen.
[1:19:22] That's fine. See, God is a God of
[1:19:25] variety. We're not comp. You can't
[1:19:27] compare yourself to another person cuz
[1:19:29] you're different to that person. God
[1:19:31] made you you.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so that spirit of
[1:19:34] comparison is a terrible knock. Amen.
[1:19:37] God has a people out of every kindred,
[1:19:40] tribe, and nation, tongue, and people.
[1:19:42] And in his books, they're all the same.
[1:19:44] One race is not superior to another.
[1:19:47] Amen. Oh, I'll just preach myself. Then
[1:19:49] we're all built the same way. Amen.
[1:19:51] There's no inferior race. Skin color
[1:19:53] don't matter to God. Amen. He's looking
[1:19:56] at that gene seed of predestination he
[1:19:57] put in your soul. That's what he looks
[1:19:59] for. And that's what we should look for
[1:20:01] as well in one another. When we see one
[1:20:03] another, WE SHOULD LOOK BEYOND THIS
[1:20:05] thing and say, "I see the word. I see a
[1:20:08] part of the bride. I see a part of
[1:20:10] myself." Amen. So, we must never have
[1:20:12] allow a spirit of comparison. And I
[1:20:15] think that it's such a problem in this
[1:20:17] day. We have so much stats and data and
[1:20:19] information about other countries, you
[1:20:21] know, oh, this is happening here and
[1:20:23] their their economy and this and blah
[1:20:25] blah blah all around the world. And then
[1:20:26] there's this this comparison. How's my
[1:20:28] sports team doing and all these things
[1:20:30] or my school or my results and all these
[1:20:32] things? It's a it's a punch because the
[1:20:35] devil doesn't want to make you feel good
[1:20:37] about yourself. He wants to make you
[1:20:38] feel very insignificant and build a big
[1:20:40] complex in your life and that's just a
[1:20:42] thing that's taking you out,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; right? Are we are we okay? Yo, I know we
[1:20:47] just had a wedding, but I'm sure we'll
[1:20:48] get happy eventually today. Amen. But
[1:20:50] you see, there's these things that God
[1:20:52] has God has revealed in his word, and
[1:20:54] it's the main thing. We can keep the
[1:20:56] punches off as much as you can. Amen. To
[1:20:59] walk humbly with thy God. Amen. Now,
[1:21:01] Brother Brham says this, I'm just laying
[1:21:03] a bit of a foundation. Hopefully, I'll
[1:21:04] build a house today. But, you know, he
[1:21:06] would speak this, I think, in the um
[1:21:08] Sardis Age and and and he takes a
[1:21:11] scripture here. This from the church age
[1:21:12] book. He says, "Remember therefore how
[1:21:14] thou hast received and heard and hold
[1:21:15] fast and repent. If therefore thou shalt
[1:21:18] not watch, I will come on thee as a
[1:21:20] thief, and thou shalt not know what hour
[1:21:22] I will come upon thee. I want to read
[1:21:24] another translation. I think it's the
[1:21:26] West translation of this verse. Be
[1:21:28] remembering therefore in what way you
[1:21:30] have received the truth as a permanent
[1:21:32] deposit and what way you heard it and be
[1:21:34] safeguarding it and have a change of
[1:21:36] mind at once. It is very evident from
[1:21:38] this verse that God has given them truth
[1:21:40] as a permanent deposit. That's what
[1:21:43] revelation is. It was received and it is
[1:21:45] irrevoc ir irrevocably theirs. It now
[1:21:49] remains to be seen that they will uh
[1:21:50] what they'll do with it whether they'll
[1:21:52] regard it or not. And that is true. They
[1:21:55] have been given the basic truth of the
[1:21:58] whole gospel. The just shall live by
[1:21:59] faith. Salvations of the Lord. This is
[1:22:02] this is the reformation time. They had
[1:22:03] heard the truth of the Bible which cast
[1:22:05] down the doctrines of Rome and said it
[1:22:07] not all papal authority. They knew the
[1:22:09] truth that the church does not save.
[1:22:11] They understood the Lord's supper. They
[1:22:12] had light on water baptism. They put out
[1:22:14] the images truth. There was never such
[1:22:17] an age with more men so much light to
[1:22:19] shed. They had enough illumination to
[1:22:22] completely I just like these words to
[1:22:24] completely overhaul the old system and
[1:22:27] to start out fresh and let God lead them
[1:22:29] line upon line and precept upon precept.
[1:22:32] This is the opportunity they had. And I
[1:22:34] say this morning, we still have that
[1:22:36] opportunity because the old way has been
[1:22:39] demolished. Amen. God has brought his
[1:22:41] word that we don't just have to continue
[1:22:43] with an old way of an old approach with
[1:22:45] God. But God has shown us in his word
[1:22:47] how to walk with him. They received the
[1:22:49] truth. They wanted and heard it. But the
[1:22:51] question was, how did they hear it? Did
[1:22:54] they hear it to build upon or was it the
[1:22:56] same attitude that many Greeks had,
[1:22:58] something to discuss or theorize over?
[1:23:00] Evidently, the rich words of truth were
[1:23:02] being heard in an academic manner rather
[1:23:05] than a practical outworking for God was
[1:23:07] demanding a change of mind concerning
[1:23:09] it. You see, so it was still a theory to
[1:23:12] them. It wasn't a for for it to be a
[1:23:14] practical outworking. And even I've been
[1:23:16] in countries, I've given people message
[1:23:17] books and you know, they tell me, "Well,
[1:23:19] I'll go read it and I'll tell you what
[1:23:20] I've learned." I said, "It's not about
[1:23:22] learning." I mean, this gospel is not an
[1:23:24] intellectual understanding. It's not
[1:23:26] it's not going to a school. It's letting
[1:23:28] God pour himself in. Amen. Where he
[1:23:30] reveals himself. He broods over your
[1:23:32] life. He begins to draw you. Amen. And
[1:23:35] you make a full surrender. God puts that
[1:23:37] word in you and and he and he makes it
[1:23:39] flesh in you. Amen. So we're not here
[1:23:41] just to theorize.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; We're not here to keep the message as a
[1:23:45] mystery. Amen. No. No. The mystery of
[1:23:47] God is finished in this day. Amen. It's
[1:23:49] now a reality. It's been revealed. Amen.
[1:23:52] It's not here to keep the word as a
[1:23:54] theory, but it's got to be it's got to
[1:23:55] have a practical outworking. Amen. So
[1:23:58] now this is the same thing with you know
[1:24:00] as we look into Micah here that there is
[1:24:03] a there is a way that they wanted to you
[1:24:06] know way that we must walk. Now I know
[1:24:08] this may be very elementary but you know
[1:24:10] this is the way to keep punches of you
[1:24:11] who don't who wants to avoid being
[1:24:13] punched
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; who's not the devil's punching bag.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I think I think I think these
[1:24:18] things are helpful. Now Micah would say,
[1:24:20] "He has showed thee, oh man, what is
[1:24:22] good and and what does the Lord require
[1:24:24] of thee? But to do justly and to love
[1:24:26] mercy and to walk humbly with thy God."
[1:24:28] Now, now, now to do justly is to judge.
[1:24:31] That is to pronounce sentence. So as to
[1:24:33] have discernment, it's be to judge a
[1:24:36] righteous judgment. Amen. As Jesus would
[1:24:38] say, judge not according to the
[1:24:40] appearance, but to judge righteous
[1:24:43] judgment. Amen. So that's to God has
[1:24:45] given us the Holy Ghost in this day we
[1:24:47] know is the eagle anointing. Amen. It's
[1:24:49] the only of those four living creatures
[1:24:51] that is heaven heavenbound. Amen. It's
[1:24:53] not an earthbound creature of the lion
[1:24:55] or the ox or the or the man. Amen. But
[1:24:58] the eagle anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:59] this day takes us up into the heavenlies
[1:25:01] that we can look from eternity to
[1:25:04] eternity. We can actually look at the
[1:25:05] big picture of redemption. Amen. That we
[1:25:08] can look and see a person and and how
[1:25:10] they treat us, how they act. We can look
[1:25:12] beyond that. Amen. Where we're not just
[1:25:14] a tit for tat. You know, you said this,
[1:25:16] I'll say it in kind and just a carnal
[1:25:18] way of living. I tell you what, if you
[1:25:20] really have the Holy Ghost, you'll be
[1:25:21] able to look beyond how people treat
[1:25:23] you. IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE HOW they they
[1:25:26] treat you and you're carnal, I think you
[1:25:28] need a filling. Amen. You need a real
[1:25:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost where you can
[1:25:33] look beyond what is going on and you can
[1:25:35] be lifted up, amen, into the presence of
[1:25:38] God and see what that person's going
[1:25:40] through.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this is the anointing that
[1:25:44] we've been given. We can look beyond the
[1:25:46] five senses.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can let the word live
[1:25:50] through your life. I mean, you got
[1:25:52] trouble in your home. You got that eagle
[1:25:54] anointing. You can look beyond what's
[1:25:55] going on. And you can begin to say,
[1:25:57] "God, why are they like that? Why is my
[1:26:00] child going through these things? Why is
[1:26:02] my spouse acting this way?" And you can
[1:26:04] actually begin to let God give you the
[1:26:06] wisdom and the counsel that it's not
[1:26:09] just, well, they need to behave. They
[1:26:10] need to line up. But then you always
[1:26:11] look beyond that and say, "What is the
[1:26:13] why?" Do you believe he shows you the
[1:26:16] why?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe he actually shows
[1:26:19] you really what's going on? Just like,
[1:26:21] you know, brother Brown says, "If I have
[1:26:22] found grace in your sight through God,
[1:26:25] you take my words for this, brethren, if
[1:26:27] you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:26:29] blessing when a man has done you wrong."
[1:26:31] So, who wants a blessing?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when a man has done you wrong
[1:26:34] and he's absolutely justly, I mean, he's
[1:26:37] done you wrong and you know that he's
[1:26:38] done you wrong, he's done you evil,
[1:26:40] don't mention that. You take him to
[1:26:42] prayer before God
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; and don't take it in a way just a
[1:26:46] selfish well I'm supposed to do this but
[1:26:48] stand with your shoulder to his shoulder
[1:26:51] and stand in the presence of God our
[1:26:53] father way a prayer should be made in
[1:26:55] the presence of God. Say father here's
[1:26:57] my brother and he justly he deserves
[1:26:59] punishment because he's done me evil and
[1:27:01] I don't know why he did it. Then let God
[1:27:03] go talking to you.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Do we really let God speak back to us? I
[1:27:08] believe, you know, communion is a
[1:27:10] two-way thing. It's not just us talking
[1:27:12] to the Lord and then he doesn't speak
[1:27:13] back. No, we serve a God that speaks. He
[1:27:16] counsels. He gives guidance. He reveals
[1:27:19] his word. I mean, we step into a
[1:27:21] situation, he gives you REVELATION FOR
[1:27:23] THAT MOMENT. AMEN. HE'S A GOD THAT
[1:27:25] SPEAKS. He's not a silent mute somewhere
[1:27:27] distant, but he's actively working in
[1:27:29] the lives of his children. Amen. So, so
[1:27:31] this is why we should always wait for
[1:27:33] him to speak back. I mean, if we're in
[1:27:36] the presence of the Lord, I believe,
[1:27:37] Amen. It's more than just going by a
[1:27:38] feeling, but God can give you just even
[1:27:41] just a few words, but it's concise. It's
[1:27:43] powerful, and it just answers the whole
[1:27:45] question. Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then so he then let God go
[1:27:50] talking to you, and you'll see maybe
[1:27:53] what that man has been through. The
[1:27:55] devil's twisted him up somewhere and
[1:27:56] caused him to do that, though, he's
[1:27:58] absolutely wrong. Before you leave the
[1:28:00] throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry
[1:28:02] for that man. You'll be sympathizing
[1:28:04] with that brother. And when you get back
[1:28:06] down where earth again, you'll go over
[1:28:08] to that brother and shake his hand.
[1:28:11] Amen. Cuz you know what he's been
[1:28:12] through. You can't stand with a mortal
[1:28:15] in the presence of God and condemn
[1:28:17] anybody. And I think sometimes we we we
[1:28:22] allow God to be grieved that we get into
[1:28:25] such a carnal state that we forget what
[1:28:28] it's like to be in the presence of God.
[1:28:31] We're human,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; right? But we can get into such a mode
[1:28:34] and build a build a build a tower of
[1:28:38] quotes and scriptures to justify our
[1:28:40] stand, but God is not in it. That's not
[1:28:43] how we walk with our God. We got to do
[1:28:44] justly. We need we need righteous
[1:28:46] judgment to look beyond how people treat
[1:28:49] us because many times, you know, iron
[1:28:51] sharpens iron. We like to talk about
[1:28:53] that, yeah, we we're being molded and
[1:28:55] we're being shaped and but we don't
[1:28:57] realize it's the ones closest to us are
[1:28:59] the ones that really have the strongest
[1:29:01] knife or the or the biggest mortar and
[1:29:04] pestle. And you know, the ones that are
[1:29:05] in, you know, fellowship with us or in
[1:29:07] family especially, they're God's agents.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You got to realize that everyone in your
[1:29:12] life is actually for your good.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. how they treat you, how they speak
[1:29:16] to you, if they disrespect you, if
[1:29:17] they're mean, IF THEY USE YOU, WHATEVER
[1:29:19] IT IS, THAT IS GOD'S agent in your life.
[1:29:22] And it's not because God is unhappy with
[1:29:24] you. It's not because God is beating
[1:29:26] you. No, God wants to mold and shape you
[1:29:28] into his image. AND HE WILL USE THE
[1:29:30] UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS. HALLELUJAH. I
[1:29:34] mean, where was where was Moses molded
[1:29:36] into a prophet? Wasn't in Pharaoh's
[1:29:37] palace. No, he had to forget all that
[1:29:39] stuff. It was 40 years on the backside
[1:29:41] of a desert with a hightempered wife
[1:29:43] with sheep and troubles and all these
[1:29:45] kind of things. God used the sand. He
[1:29:48] used the storms. HE USED THE HARDSHIP.
[1:29:51] AND THERE WAS MOSES BROKEN, MOLDED,
[1:29:53] SHAPED. HE BUT BUT HE WAS GETTING IN
[1:29:55] CONDITION. HALLELUJAH. So instead of him
[1:29:58] saying, "Why is me and this is not fair
[1:30:00] and this is wrong?" He just got used.
[1:30:04] God was doing a WORK BECAUSE HE COULD
[1:30:06] NOT ESCAPE the fact he was born under a
[1:30:08] sign that he was ordained for the job
[1:30:11] that he was there to deliver Israel out
[1:30:13] of Egypt. He knew in his heart that's
[1:30:14] what he was there for. And so God would
[1:30:16] USE BUT THE THING IS if we're selfish
[1:30:18] and we just we just look at us, we don't
[1:30:20] look at the big picture. I say spread
[1:30:22] your wings this morning in FAITH AND LET
[1:30:24] GOD TAKE YOU UP INTO the heavenlies and
[1:30:26] you REALIZE THAT THAT PROBLEM IN YOUR
[1:30:28] LIFE IS A BLESSING.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; That thing how that PERSON TREATS YOU.
[1:30:32] TODAY. THANK YOU, LORD. BECAUSE WHAT
[1:30:34] WOULD YOU be
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; if you got everything on a silver
[1:30:37] platter and nothing went wrong and it
[1:30:39] was just like microwave instant life and
[1:30:43] everything was good. What kind of
[1:30:45] character would you have? Could you be
[1:30:47] on the throne as an overcomer? No, sir.
[1:30:50] You wouldn't even BE THE COURT JESTER.
[1:30:52] YOU WOULDN'T BE EVEN be there at ALL.
[1:30:53] YOU WOULDN'T BE WELCOME BECAUSE YOU
[1:30:55] WOULD NOT HAVE THE character for the
[1:30:57] power OF GOD THAT HE'S PLACED IN YOUR
[1:30:59] LIFE. You got to have a character to
[1:31:01] operate that power. Amen. And God IS ALL
[1:31:03] THAT GOD GOD POURED INTO CHRIST, HE'S
[1:31:06] POURED INTO YOU AND I. AMEN. BUT NOW
[1:31:08] HE'S MOLDING OUR CHARACTER THAT WHEN HE
[1:31:10] WANTS THAT POWER ON FULL DISPLAY, WHICH
[1:31:12] IS IN THIS DAY, IT WILL MANIFEST ITSELF.
[1:31:15] IT'LL BE NO CARNAL, no carnal movement
[1:31:18] whatsoever. It will be God.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; God and flesh. Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So friends, you got to realize the
[1:31:24] uncomfortable moments of life are God's
[1:31:27] blessings to you.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God is molding and
[1:31:30] shaping you.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to realize no one is
[1:31:33] actually your enemy. Even the devil's
[1:31:35] just a tool in God's hand.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I MEAN, BASICALLY, GOD
[1:31:40] SET THE DEVIL ON JOB FOR JOB TO WAKE up
[1:31:43] and realize who he was. Amen. God wanted
[1:31:46] Job to have an eagle vision, an eagle
[1:31:47] anointing. I mean, that he could stand
[1:31:49] there and say, "Now I know my redeemer
[1:31:51] liveth." I mean, before that, he was
[1:31:53] blessed. He loved the Lord sure and he
[1:31:55] was trusting in the sacrifice of the
[1:31:56] lamb. But the thing is he did not know
[1:31:58] where he came from. He didn't know where
[1:32:00] he was going. He was just sitting in
[1:32:02] this natural kind of a life though a
[1:32:04] believer.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God God basically SET THE
[1:32:07] DEVIL WHO POINTED the job out to the
[1:32:10] devil. It wasn't one of his imps. It
[1:32:12] wasn't some other demon. It was God
[1:32:14] himself.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But before the devil even touched
[1:32:17] um touched Job, God had a testimony.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He's a perfect man. There's none like
[1:32:23] him in all the world. But I want him to
[1:32:25] be developed further. That I want to
[1:32:27] take the fear out of his life, the
[1:32:28] worry, the stress. I want to give him
[1:32:30] such a ROCK SOLID PEACE. AMEN. That
[1:32:33] what? Hallelujah. That when he comes OUT
[1:32:35] THE OTHER SIDE, HE'LL BE SHINING HIS
[1:32:36] GOLD. AMEN. THAT THEN thousands of years
[1:32:39] after him, I will stand in flesh, the
[1:32:41] Lord, AND HE'LL POINT BACK TO the
[1:32:43] patience of Job as a testimony to all
[1:32:45] generations. Amen. Wouldn't it be
[1:32:47] wonderful if God could do that with you
[1:32:49] and I? Amen. IF TIME WOULD PROGRESS LONG
[1:32:51] ENOUGH, AMEN. that someone would be
[1:32:53] INSPIRED TO SAY, "REMEMBER MY MY SERVANT
[1:32:55] MORGAN?"
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Any of the brethren,
[1:32:59] brothers, sisters in here, THE PATIENCE
[1:33:01] THEY HAD.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO STAND THE TEST. AMEN. JUST
[1:33:05] TRUST THE LORD. AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT WAS
[1:33:07] going on. Amen. Cuz God, what has HE
[1:33:09] DONE WITH YOU AND I IN THIS DAY? HE'S
[1:33:10] PUT YOU FORTH AS A TESTIMONY. AMEN. Of
[1:33:13] of his redeeming power. [sighs]
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:17] Amen. So Job, he got through that. He
[1:33:21] went through all that. But he could say,
[1:33:23] "I I'm going to stand on the earth with
[1:33:25] him. In my flesh, I'll see God."
[1:33:28] Hallelujah. All but all those problems,
[1:33:30] God actually used the devil as a tool.
[1:33:33] I'm going to use you, Satan, as a
[1:33:35] vehicle to give revelation.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil didn't impart it to Job,
[1:33:41] but God used the devil to get Job in a
[1:33:43] position to receive it.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we want everything
[1:33:48] nice. No one like I don't like pain. No
[1:33:51] one likes pain, I don't think, in their
[1:33:53] right mind. Right? But God, we we got to
[1:33:55] look. We got to zoom out and say,
[1:33:56] "Actually, this is all for my good,
[1:34:00] even if I don't know why."
[1:34:03] Praise the Lord. Now, let's finish this.
[1:34:07] I mean, you can't stand uh with a mortal
[1:34:09] in the presence of God and condemn
[1:34:10] anybody. I don't believe no, sir. Even
[1:34:13] if he's a ranked sinner. What about a
[1:34:15] brother that's made a mistake? Though I
[1:34:17] say he's sometimes accused wrong when
[1:34:19] he's not wrong. But if he is wrong,
[1:34:21] well, we should take him to the throne
[1:34:23] of God, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with
[1:34:25] our brother, knowing that he's immortal,
[1:34:27] and maybe his destination rests upon our
[1:34:29] attitude towards him.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Attitude,
[1:34:35] how do we treat one another?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, that family or that brother or this?
[1:34:40] Have you Have you lifted them up? Have
[1:34:42] you stood with them in prayer? took them
[1:34:44] before the throne of God.
[1:34:48] You can do this. You say, "Oh, no.
[1:34:49] That's just the prophet." No, it's for
[1:34:52] you. It's the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:54] What is our attitude towards one
[1:34:56] another? Oh, they didn't shake my hand 5
[1:34:58] years ago. Can we let these things go?
[1:35:01] That's not doing justly. That's not
[1:35:03] having divine judgment. That's not
[1:35:04] having It's not having discernment. We
[1:35:07] have bad days.
[1:35:10] Yeah. I'm glad someone's honest. We all
[1:35:12] [laughter] we all have bad days, right?
[1:35:14] I'm not making excuses, but we're all
[1:35:16] human. These bodies have not been
[1:35:18] changed. Our human spirit has not been
[1:35:20] changed. Our soul is redeemed and and
[1:35:22] and our spirit and our body are going to
[1:35:25] catch up with our soul, right? But
[1:35:27] they're still human, subject to
[1:35:30] mistakes, problems, personality clashes.
[1:35:33] I don't just gel with them. You will.
[1:35:38] There's not going to be anywhere in
[1:35:39] heaven where the extroverts are here,
[1:35:41] the introverts are here, and the deep
[1:35:42] thinkers are over there. We're all just
[1:35:44] going to be one big.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One big group. I don't get
[1:35:49] ALONG WITH THAT SIDE OF HEAVEN. I NEVER
[1:35:51] GO THERE. THAT'S NEVER GOING TO BE IN
[1:35:52] ANYONE'S MIND.
[1:35:54] YOU THINK OF SOMEONE, IT'LL JUST BE
[1:35:56] SUPREME JOY.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM FOR A
[1:36:00] MILLENNIA. LET'S GO SEE THEM. I MISS
[1:36:02] YOU. AND YOU PICK UP A CONVERSATION.
[1:36:03] IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE never a part.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not like, oh, no, I'm not.
[1:36:07] No, those people. Oh, no. That don't
[1:36:09] exist there. I think if it don't exist
[1:36:12] there, it shouldn't exist here. Amen.
[1:36:14] Because we're creatures of there, not
[1:36:16] creatures of earth.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's always have the right
[1:36:21] attitude. I believe if we have that
[1:36:24] eagle anointing, we will have the right
[1:36:25] attitude. Will we uh not get hurt? No,
[1:36:27] we'll still get hurt.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; We'll still even get offended. We'll see
[1:36:31] even carry questions and
[1:36:32] misunderstandings.
[1:36:34] But if the anointing of God is in your
[1:36:36] life, he can lift you up and show you
[1:36:38] the whole thing. He can just rest. Oh,
[1:36:40] but what if they don't apologize? That's
[1:36:41] irrelevant. Jesus wasn't hanging on
[1:36:44] Calvary and said, "Now, high priest and
[1:36:46] Sanhedrin and all you people that hate
[1:36:48] me and and are actually rejoicing. This
[1:36:50] is the only time he saw them happy is
[1:36:51] when he was dying on Calvary." He didn't
[1:36:53] say, "Now, uh, are you sorry for what
[1:36:55] you're doing to me?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Then I'll forgive you."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; No, he said, "Father, forgive them. They
[1:37:00] don't KNOW WHAT THEY DO." THAT WAS THE
[1:37:01] LAST MANIFESTATION OF GOD AS A MAN
[1:37:04] BEFORE HIS HIS RESURRECTION WAS THAT
[1:37:06] EXPRESSION. WHAT WILL be the bride
[1:37:08] before the translation? I MEAN THAT SAME
[1:37:11] SPIRIT, that same heart, THAT SAME
[1:37:12] ATTITUDE BE FATHER FORGIVE THEM. THEY
[1:37:15] DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I believe we're living in that season.
[1:37:19] Oh, one day. No, today 2025 is a good
[1:37:22] time. I mean, WE'RE LIVING IN THE LAST
[1:37:24] FEW MOMENTS FOR THE CHANGE OF THE BODY.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, SO WHAT IS CHRIST GOING to be
[1:37:28] manifested as bride? Cuz remember
[1:37:29] brother Aaron says she is him. So all
[1:37:31] that you see in the bridegroom is in the
[1:37:33] bride. There's no difference. Amen. It's
[1:37:35] the same manifestation. THE SAME GOD
[1:37:37] LIVING IN A MULTI-MEMBERED PEOPLE NOW.
[1:37:39] So what so what's the attitude of us
[1:37:41] going to be? Father forgive them. They
[1:37:43] don't know what they do. Oh, I have to
[1:37:45] do it. No, it's out of your heart. Lord,
[1:37:47] I don't want a bad attitude towards
[1:37:48] anyone. I don't want any kind of, oh,
[1:37:50] they better be pushed down there. And
[1:37:52] Lord, you better make different levels
[1:37:54] of heaven. Put them at the bottom one.
[1:37:57] We shouldn't have that kind of an
[1:37:58] attitude. I'm not trying to make jokes,
[1:38:00] but you know, like we Yeah, we want to
[1:38:02] see everyone saved, but just put them
[1:38:03] down the slums somewhere. No, we
[1:38:06] shouldn't have that attitude. We should
[1:38:08] have a attitude. Lord, I want to see
[1:38:09] them there. Even Even if I don't get
[1:38:11] there, may they get there.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I want to get there. Yeah, but
[1:38:16] wouldn't you be happy to see someone to
[1:38:19] be part of someone getting there? We're
[1:38:21] going to celebrate one another getting a
[1:38:22] crown of life.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Because we have that attitude,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Lord. They made it. Thank you.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, the biggest
[1:38:30] celebrations of those watching the
[1:38:32] saints get crowned be those who knew
[1:38:34] them in the flesh that battled with
[1:38:36] them, walked with them, had fellowship,
[1:38:38] prayed together, cried together. Amen.
[1:38:40] Because we'll see, Lord, you your grace
[1:38:42] is so amazing. Hallelujah. Amen. We
[1:38:45] won't be quiet. Oh, well, next. Who's
[1:38:48] next on the list? No, we'll be rejoicing
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; We made it, brother and Paul.
[1:38:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's going TO BE
[1:38:56] A GLORIOUS MOMENT. AMEN. WHEN WE SEE ONE
[1:38:58] ANOTHER CROWNED, HE SAY, "THANK YOU,
[1:39:00] LORD, THAT I CAN BE IDENTIFIED ON THE
[1:39:03] OTHER SIDE WITH SAINTS LIKE THESE."
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I think we should just start
[1:39:09] having that attitude right now.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then you'll be able to realize
[1:39:13] that brother, that sister that just
[1:39:15] grinded me the wrong way. Thank you,
[1:39:18] Lord.
[1:39:20] Amen. Thank you for the struggle.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the inner turmoil, Lord.
[1:39:26] Thank you THAT DROVE ME TO PRAYER.
[1:39:28] DIDN'T DRIVE me to gossip and to BE
[1:39:30] BITTER AND RESENTFUL. BUT LORD, IT
[1:39:32] BROUGHT ME TO A PLACE WHERE THE
[1:39:34] SWEETNESS of God came into my life.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, how do you do that?"
[1:39:38] It's very simple. When Moses crossed the
[1:39:40] Red Sea with the children of Israel,
[1:39:41] they journeyed three days, no water.
[1:39:44] They came to a a you know, water. They
[1:39:46] thought they're going to be refreshed.
[1:39:47] It was a bitter water. They came to a
[1:39:49] bitter experience after a great jubilee
[1:39:52] dancing on the seashore seeing their
[1:39:54] enemies dead. Brother Ron said that's
[1:39:56] the type of when you come through the
[1:39:57] blood you look back and see all your
[1:39:58] enemies are dead in the blood. You begin
[1:40:00] to DANCE AND REJOICE. GOD TOOK them from
[1:40:02] a jubilee into a bitter time. But God
[1:40:07] was proving something because Moses was
[1:40:09] inspired to cut down a tree, a certain
[1:40:12] tree, mix it with the water and it
[1:40:14] became sweet. So God was showing that an
[1:40:17] an experience may be bitter, but there's
[1:40:20] something hanging there. That tree was
[1:40:22] Calvary. That tree was the cross. THAT
[1:40:24] IF YOU MIX CALVARY WITH ANY BITTER
[1:40:26] EXPERIENCE, no matter how deep, how bad,
[1:40:29] how hurtful, how scarring, if you mix IT
[1:40:31] WITH CALVARY, IT WILL BECOME A SWEET
[1:40:33] THING IN YOUR MIND.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW'S IT BECOME SWEET? Thank you
[1:40:37] for taking saving me, Lord.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you for lifting me up out of that
[1:40:41] bitterness. Thank you. I can embrace
[1:40:43] that brother, embrace that sister with
[1:40:45] love instead of resentment and building
[1:40:47] walls. Lord, thank you for doing a work
[1:40:49] in my life and SHOW ME WHAT THEY'RE
[1:40:50] GOING THROUGH, LORD, THAT I CAN LOVE
[1:40:52] THEM AND PRAY FOR THEM, have a burden
[1:40:53] for them, Lord, like I never did before.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a sweet tooth, so I like sweet
[1:41:01] things. So, I always want to mix Calvary
[1:41:03] with any experience.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We have the odd that you can't do
[1:41:08] that. Yeah, you can try it one time. Try
[1:41:12] it one time. It's been my whole life has
[1:41:15] been bitter. No, it'll become sweet.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You see redemption take place and become
[1:41:19] sweet. Amen. Nomi said, "Don't call me
[1:41:21] Nomi anymore. My life is bitter. Call
[1:41:23] me, you know, all these things." But
[1:41:24] what happened? Redemption came into her
[1:41:26] life. Amen. Through Ruth, IT BECAME A
[1:41:29] SWEET TIME. ALL THOSE MEMORIES of loss
[1:41:31] and those years and those things, IT WAS
[1:41:33] RESTORED TO HER. AND THEN WHEN RUTH had
[1:41:35] the baby by Boaz, you know, her
[1:41:37] grandchild, grandson came into HER LIFE.
[1:41:40] AMEN. NOW SHE could rejoice ever more
[1:41:42] cuz now she was embracing life. Amen.
[1:41:45] And you just let redemption take place.
[1:41:46] You start embracing life. Amen. The life
[1:41:49] of God. Hallelujah. And all that
[1:41:51] business would be Lord that was for a
[1:41:53] purpose. Lord your eternal work. I
[1:41:55] didn't UNDERSTAND THOSE FOOTSTEPS. EVEN
[1:41:57] my husband saying let's go and live in
[1:41:59] Moab and all these things. And you know
[1:42:02] nights of wondering why and how did my
[1:42:04] life come to this. But then life came.
[1:42:07] Redemption.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. What'd she do? She took that
[1:42:10] bitter experience of her life and mixed
[1:42:12] it with Calvary and it became sweet.
[1:42:18] You can do it.
[1:42:21] Don't be afraid
[1:42:23] to do it. Don't be used to just living a
[1:42:26] bitter life.
[1:42:28] Why? I'd rather live on the mountain
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; that in the valley. He say, "Well, you
[1:42:34] can't be in boat." We just take the
[1:42:35] valley with you up the mountain. I'm a
[1:42:37] Christian and good times or bad.
[1:42:39] Amen. I don't want to be selfish
[1:42:41] anytime. If I'm a believer, I forfeited
[1:42:43] my rights. You know, you know, this is
[1:42:45] an age of people's rights. Well, they're
[1:42:48] wrong and they didn't do this to me, so
[1:42:49] therefore, I'll do this and all these
[1:42:50] things. This is my rights. We forfeit
[1:42:53] our rights.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We let God just share it all off.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; I'm your lamb, Lord. Do with me what you
[1:42:59] want.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as I'm his lamb.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's the Because he can't lose one of
[1:43:04] them.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sun goes down, all the
[1:43:07] other animals are left on the pasture.
[1:43:08] But the shepherd takes his sheep into
[1:43:10] the fold. Amen. When this age closes,
[1:43:12] the rapture takes place. If I'm his
[1:43:13] lamb, I'm going in. Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, amen. And to love
[1:43:20] mercy. We just I'm just breaking this
[1:43:21] down as we go. I hope you don't mind
[1:43:23] this. We're just having a we're having a
[1:43:24] time. I mean, but but but we should it
[1:43:27] should just be our nature to love mercy.
[1:43:30] Just to love it. I mean, not to not to
[1:43:33] love casting people down, not to love
[1:43:37] gossiping, not loving to spread rumors
[1:43:39] and malice and strife. It shouldn't even
[1:43:42] it's not even in the nature of a
[1:43:44] believer. Now, that's a carnal nature,
[1:43:46] right? That's a carnal nature. But the
[1:43:48] spiritual nature of a believer should be
[1:43:50] I love mercy. I don't want to see anyone
[1:43:53] go through anything that they shouldn't
[1:43:56] go through. I don't want to see people
[1:43:57] thrown out. I'm not here to be the
[1:43:59] ambulance at the bottom of the cliff to
[1:44:01] try and help someone. Who's heard of
[1:44:02] that saying? You know, they put an am
[1:44:04] there's a cliff, someone falls off and
[1:44:05] they put an ambulance here to just pick
[1:44:07] that up the pieces. So, we don't want to
[1:44:09] have an attitude among us that, you
[1:44:12] know, there's people that we shun in
[1:44:13] church and we just basically by our
[1:44:15] attitude push them out and now they're
[1:44:17] in the world now. Let's have prayer
[1:44:18] meetings and fast and pray for that
[1:44:20] person. That's the ambulance at the
[1:44:21] bottom of the cliff. That's not loving
[1:44:24] mercy. That's just having a judgmental
[1:44:27] superior spirit trying to push someone
[1:44:28] out. We should abhore that kind of a
[1:44:31] feeling. Amen. We should it it should
[1:44:34] grieve us when someone doesn't come to
[1:44:36] church anymore. It should bother us
[1:44:38] greatly. Where is that person? Where's
[1:44:40] that brother? Where's that sister?
[1:44:41] What's going on? We should have a
[1:44:43] genuine concern because we're not an
[1:44:46] ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.
[1:44:48] We're at the top of the cliff.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we should love. Now, now this
[1:44:53] mercy, I think it's from the Oxford
[1:44:54] dictionary. It says compassion or
[1:44:57] forgiveness shown towards someone whom
[1:45:00] it is within one's power to punish your
[1:45:02] harm. This is what mercy is. Oh, I can
[1:45:06] punish that per I can harm their
[1:45:07] character. I can harm their harm harm
[1:45:10] their reputation, spreading gossip and
[1:45:12] malice about these, you know, different
[1:45:14] people. That is not someone who's full
[1:45:16] of mercy and compassion. Amen. But
[1:45:19] someone who's full of mercy, Amen. They
[1:45:22] will they will have they will have such
[1:45:24] a atmosphere about them that they just
[1:45:26] want all those things to go away. They
[1:45:29] want to fill the breach. They don't want
[1:45:31] any gaps between anybody. They don't
[1:45:33] want any golf. Who's with me this
[1:45:34] morning? I mean they want to see love
[1:45:36] flow. I mean they'll see someone who's
[1:45:38] maybe acting out or you know acting up
[1:45:41] all these things. They don't want to
[1:45:42] push that person down. You know we never
[1:45:44] want an attitude. Oh that make that
[1:45:45] person makes the church look bad. It's
[1:45:48] not about what we look like. That that's
[1:45:51] just hypocritical. This is meant to be a
[1:45:54] place where people come broken, they get
[1:45:56] mended.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; People who are troubled, they they find
[1:45:59] peace. People who don't know who they
[1:46:01] are, they could be dressed up. They
[1:46:03] could be they could be all kinds of
[1:46:04] sides of the alphabet rainbow stuff.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And we don't shun them. We say, "God
[1:46:10] bless you.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Welcome."
[1:46:14] We don't say, "Oh, you can't come in
[1:46:15] here." Everyone's welcome
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; because God is here to bring healing and
[1:46:20] deliverance and a true identity through
[1:46:22] the message of the hour where we realize
[1:46:24] that we are part of the open book. Amen.
[1:46:27] Because because brother Ram said that
[1:46:29] Boh Boaz claiming Ruth is the same as
[1:46:31] Christ taking the book. Amen. So our
[1:46:34] identity is we are the lamb's wife. And
[1:46:36] if anyone comes in to come under the
[1:46:38] sound of the word, we should say Lord I
[1:46:40] believe they're one of yours.
[1:46:43] So why should we want to push anyone
[1:46:45] out? Someone who's in their teenage
[1:46:48] years just trying to find their feet.
[1:46:50] You don't push them down.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; You don't push young people out. You
[1:46:52] encourage them. Someone's in their early
[1:46:55] 20s still trying to find their feet. We
[1:46:57] don't push them down. Newly married or
[1:47:00] longtime married, whoever, doesn't
[1:47:02] matter what age, you don't push anyone
[1:47:04] down. That's not loving mercy. That's
[1:47:06] just trying to make, oh, but the church
[1:47:07] will look bad. Sure, we we don't go
[1:47:11] beyond the word, but why would we worry
[1:47:14] about what it looks like? That's pride.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Does my church look good? Does it sound
[1:47:19] the best? That's just a spirit of
[1:47:20] comparison. You're just getting hits.
[1:47:22] You're just getting punches by the
[1:47:23] devil. No, we should just let anyone
[1:47:25] come in. And I I know you do. It should
[1:47:27] be our heart, right?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; If God saved you, do you think he say,
[1:47:31] "What about the person on the street?"
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; When the Lord found me, I realized he
[1:47:36] can save anybody. He can find anyone. I
[1:47:39] was well, you know my testimony. God
[1:47:42] found me in darkness making homebrew,
[1:47:45] partying university student. Even would
[1:47:47] have written me off, but God didn't.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; So why should we write someone off?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, they blasphemed whatever. No, no,
[1:47:53] that's God's God's the judge. God is God
[1:47:57] is God. I'm not God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:59] I'm glad. You know, you know, why do we
[1:48:01] make ourselves God? Let him be God.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Let him make those decisions. Amen. And
[1:48:06] now Jesus would say, "Blessed are the
[1:48:08] merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
[1:48:10] Now merciful here is to be
[1:48:12] compassionate. It's by word or deed and
[1:48:14] and and especially by divine grace. This
[1:48:18] is how you're merciful. Now divine grace
[1:48:20] is an in it's it's the influence of God
[1:48:23] upon our heart and its reflection in our
[1:48:25] life. That's how you know if you've
[1:48:26] really come under grace is that the
[1:48:28] spirit of God takes control of your
[1:48:30] life.
[1:48:32] Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; So if you're merciful, you'll obtain
[1:48:35] mercy. Yes.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we should love mercy.
[1:48:38] You know, you know, it's like children,
[1:48:40] right? There's a big fight going on and
[1:48:41] you know, if they're not the naughty
[1:48:43] one, they want to they want the they
[1:48:45] want the whole corporal punishment. They
[1:48:47] want the fullest extent of the law of
[1:48:49] the house to be poured out upon their
[1:48:51] sibling that's done them wrong. But if
[1:48:53] it's them in their shoes, they're
[1:48:55] pleading mercy. They're saying, "Sorry,
[1:48:57] you know, they're saying, "Forgive me. I
[1:49:00] really didn't mean it." But if they're
[1:49:01] the if they're the victim, they're like,
[1:49:03] "Get them. deal with him.
[1:49:07] Amen.
[1:49:09] We want mercy,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; right? So why would we want someone else
[1:49:13] have the full extent of God's wrath
[1:49:14] poured upon them?
[1:49:17] Amen.
[1:49:19] All right.
[1:49:23] Amen. Now when pride cometh, then cometh
[1:49:25] shame. But with the lowly, which is the
[1:49:28] word humble, is wisdom. Last part of
[1:49:31] that verse was to walk humbly with our
[1:49:33] God.
[1:49:35] Now to be humble
[1:49:37] is very very powerful because it's
[1:49:40] through the humble that God will
[1:49:42] manifest his word. Now I'm just trying
[1:49:43] to find where I am on my notes so I'm
[1:49:44] kind of jumping around a bit. Now a true
[1:49:49] humility is not wearing old clothes,
[1:49:53] driving an old car, kind of being a bit
[1:49:55] backward. A true humility is being
[1:49:58] surrendered to the word. That's true
[1:50:00] humility. Okay. Now, with true humility,
[1:50:03] God can flow through that life. As I
[1:50:06] said in the beginning where, you know,
[1:50:07] we talk about Enoch's walk and Enoch
[1:50:09] would have had a humble walk.
[1:50:11] Okay. So, now when Isaiah
[1:50:15] when Isaiah was in the temple, now I
[1:50:17] just want you to think about this.
[1:50:19] There he was. He was in the most holy
[1:50:22] place, the temple, in the most holy
[1:50:25] city, Jerusalem, living among one of
[1:50:27] living among and he was one of God's
[1:50:29] people. He was a covenant son of Abraham
[1:50:33] and he also was a prophet. But you see,
[1:50:36] he had to learn to walk a way that
[1:50:39] pleases God. Okay? He was in a place
[1:50:41] that looked pleasing, but the whole
[1:50:43] nation needed needed God. Okay? So we
[1:50:46] can't get we can't lean upon a message
[1:50:49] system to say I'm doing okay. It's you
[1:50:52] and God walking together. Right? It's
[1:50:54] not based on your parents. It's not
[1:50:55] based on your siblings or your church.
[1:50:57] It's you and God. Okay. The thing is
[1:51:00] what happened was is is um Isaiah
[1:51:04] he was being influenced too much by by
[1:51:08] the king Uzziah. He was leaning. Brother
[1:51:10] Bam would speak about many times of you
[1:51:12] know you're the you're the message
[1:51:13] influence. And he says he was influenced
[1:51:16] by the king. And he was influenced by
[1:51:19] him so much that he wasn't influenced by
[1:51:21] almighty God as much as he should have
[1:51:23] been. And the scripture says in Isaiah
[1:51:25] 6, in the year that King Uzziah died, he
[1:51:28] was in the temple. He saw the Lord high
[1:51:30] and lifted up. I'm sure we all know the
[1:51:32] story. I remember what but what happened
[1:51:34] is Isaiah was disappointed in Uziah's
[1:51:38] ending. How he would end up because
[1:51:40] Uzziah got lifted up in pride. Basically
[1:51:42] all he did, he touched it, turned to
[1:51:44] gold. He put it that way. He's blessed
[1:51:45] in every way. So he just decided, I can
[1:51:48] go beyond my office and be a priest. And
[1:51:50] you know the story, there's I don't know
[1:51:51] how many 70 of them or something of the
[1:51:53] priest saying, you know, don't don't go
[1:51:54] offer incense. You know, King Uzziah,
[1:51:57] you're a good king, but you're not a
[1:51:58] priest. You're not ordained to be so.
[1:51:59] But he thought he can do what he wanted.
[1:52:01] So he took that sensor. He went into
[1:52:03] offer incense to the Lord. He got and he
[1:52:05] was full-blown leper. And he died that
[1:52:08] way. So Isaiah was disappointed by how
[1:52:11] by how um Uzziah ended up.
[1:52:15] It shook Isaiah. See these things are
[1:52:17] good for us. It shook Isaiah. It shook
[1:52:19] his faith. It pulled the rug from under
[1:52:21] his feet of what he was trusting in
[1:52:24] security for. Oh, my pastor's the best
[1:52:27] one. He can preach like no one else. My
[1:52:29] church is this way. He was getting
[1:52:31] knocks from that spirit of comparison.
[1:52:33] And God had to take those things away
[1:52:35] from him because he had a far more
[1:52:37] important job than just being being
[1:52:40] influenced by the king. He had to write
[1:52:42] the Bible in 66 chapters. Amen. He had
[1:52:46] to write incredible prophecies. God had
[1:52:48] to use him in a way that he could not be
[1:52:50] used being just under this influence of
[1:52:52] the king. Now, God did this because God
[1:52:56] wanted to be his main influence. And
[1:52:58] you'll find if you get disappointed in
[1:53:00] another believer, it's cuz many times we
[1:53:03] put them on a pedestal. Amen. And we and
[1:53:06] we lift them up into a place they're not
[1:53:07] ordained to be. And it might not even be
[1:53:09] sin that makes you disappointed. Just
[1:53:11] maybe an attitude or something they say
[1:53:13] or something that transpires. And we can
[1:53:15] become disappointed in one another,
[1:53:18] which we do. We're human. Okay? But the
[1:53:20] but the reason God does that is he's
[1:53:22] actually trying to get your attention.
[1:53:24] You've been trusting or leaning upon
[1:53:26] that person too much. So I have to make
[1:53:28] you disappointed in them. So you will
[1:53:30] turn to me. And so Isaiah, he was there
[1:53:32] in the temple. And he was he was he was
[1:53:35] there. He went to the right place. He
[1:53:37] was disappointed because God wanted to
[1:53:40] give him a right walk. And so God
[1:53:42] allowed this falling out to take place,
[1:53:44] these failures, these incidents to
[1:53:46] happen. So Isaiah could get into a state
[1:53:49] where he could see this heavenly have
[1:53:51] this heavenly visitation and he could
[1:53:53] make a confession and a cleansing and
[1:53:55] and he could be put into action. Amen.
[1:53:58] So now Isaiah when he remember he he's
[1:54:00] in the most holy place, the temple in
[1:54:02] the most holy city, Jerusalem. He's one
[1:54:04] of God's holy people, a circumcised son
[1:54:06] of Abraham. But when God when he had
[1:54:09] this visitation, he just cried out, "Woe
[1:54:12] is me, for I'm undone." Here is now a
[1:54:15] man who's starting to walk justly with
[1:54:17] his God and know mercy and to walk
[1:54:19] humbly with his God. As we read in
[1:54:20] Micah, he cried out, "Woe is me for I am
[1:54:22] undone because I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:54:25] and I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:54:26] unclean lips." Amen. And for my eyes
[1:54:29] have seen the king, the Lord of hosts.
[1:54:31] So he be to he be to realize actually
[1:54:33] we're all in the same state. That's why
[1:54:36] I was saying before, you take some
[1:54:37] before the throne of God in prayer, you
[1:54:39] realize the state they're in, but you
[1:54:40] realize the state you're in. Amen. And
[1:54:43] so God moved him in this way that he
[1:54:45] could actually walk humbly with his God.
[1:54:47] We got to realize without God's God's
[1:54:49] keeping power, where would we be?
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not our human ability that
[1:54:54] holds on to God. It's not our human
[1:54:56] ability that gets us into a rapture.
[1:54:58] It's God's power and enablement by his
[1:55:00] Holy Ghost. Amen. It is the message of
[1:55:03] the hour that's given you the grace of
[1:55:04] God. Amen. It's God's grace finding you.
[1:55:07] It's not us, oh well, I did this and I
[1:55:09] did that. That's not a testimony. The
[1:55:11] testimony is God did it and I was just
[1:55:12] there at the same time.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just there when he showed
[1:55:15] up. That's what brother said about the
[1:55:17] Ohio River. He said, "I was just there
[1:55:19] when he came."
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't that be our attitude as well?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he could he could walk
[1:55:26] humbly with his God. Now, I just want
[1:55:28] you to think about who's in our midst
[1:55:30] this morning. Amen. And I'm going to get
[1:55:33] to humility.
[1:55:34] We are not in the midst of a religious
[1:55:36] system.
[1:55:38] We are not in the midst of a of a nice
[1:55:41] idea or a human movement. We're not even
[1:55:44] in the midst of a prophet messenger,
[1:55:47] though that would be amazing to be in
[1:55:48] those days. So, I'm not I'm not putting
[1:55:50] those things down. But who is in our
[1:55:52] midst in 2025? Who has never left thee
[1:55:55] nor forsaken me? Who has been with you
[1:55:57] in the good times and the bad? Amen.
[1:56:00] More than just an angel, more than just
[1:56:02] a, you know, more than just a seraraphim
[1:56:05] or a cherubam or even an archangel, but
[1:56:07] the Lord God Almighty, amen, is in our
[1:56:10] midst. And brother Ram would say in the
[1:56:13] restoration of the bride, and I pray
[1:56:14] this just comes out how it's blessed me
[1:56:16] for a long time. Amen.
[1:56:19] Hallelujah. And the restoration of the
[1:56:20] bride tree, brother Ram would take the
[1:56:22] time when Jesus was dead to when he was
[1:56:24] revealed himself to the disciples. It's
[1:56:26] just like Luther's day. It was just a
[1:56:28] dead form. But then but then uh in the
[1:56:31] third day there was a rumor like in the
[1:56:32] day of Pentecost there was a rumor that
[1:56:35] God is alive but he went from a rumor to
[1:56:38] a reality when he stepped into the midst
[1:56:40] of the disciples and said here I am
[1:56:42] touch I'm alive give me something to
[1:56:44] eat. Amen. So he was no longer a rumor
[1:56:47] but he was a vindicated FACT OR A
[1:56:49] VINDICATED TRUTH. HE was a resurrected
[1:56:52] God. Amen. That was in their midst
[1:56:54] walking talking moving among them.
[1:56:56] friends. So, we are no longer living
[1:56:58] just with a rumor of God. Is he still
[1:57:01] alive? Is the message still true? Is God
[1:57:03] really a God of miracles? Does he really
[1:57:06] do what he said he WOULD DO? THE DAYS OF
[1:57:08] RUMOR are over.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're living in a DAY WHERE HE
[1:57:11] WALKS AMONG US. HIS SPIRIT MOVES AND HE
[1:57:13] BREWS AND HE TOUCHES LIVES AND GETS A
[1:57:15] HOLD of lives AND REVEALS HIS WORD and
[1:57:18] proves himself THROUGH THE BRIDE. AMEN.
[1:57:20] WE'RE NO LONGER LIVING A DAY. THIS IS
[1:57:22] NOT A RUMOR DAY OF A HEARAY AND A MAYBE
[1:57:25] AND A NO. WE KNOW HE'S ALIVE. I MEAN, WE
[1:57:28] KNOW HE'S PRESENT. I MEAN, WE KNOW HE
[1:57:30] WORKS. WE KNOW HIS WORD IS TRUE. I MEAN,
[1:57:32] WE KNOW THAT WE'RE WALKING LIKE ENOCH
[1:57:34] WALKED. AMEN. Cuz why? Cuz God has
[1:57:36] revealed himself. Many people say, "If
[1:57:39] only I could go back in the days of the
[1:57:41] prophet, this is a better day."
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; And if he COULD BE HERE, HE WOULD BE
[1:57:45] HERE. If he could be here. BUT THAT WAS
[1:57:46] HIS TIME. AMEN. TO GIVE A WORD. AMEN.
[1:57:49] THAT A BRIDE WOULD PICK IT UP BY
[1:57:50] REVELATION AND God would manifest
[1:57:53] himself through every part of that
[1:57:54] bride. Amen. So, we're not living in a
[1:57:57] day of a rumor. Now, he's not physically
[1:57:59] here in his corporal body. We'll meet
[1:58:00] that in the air. I just want this as an
[1:58:02] illustration. He went from a rumor, but
[1:58:04] he appeared among them. They were holed
[1:58:06] up in a little a little life, a little a
[1:58:10] little world, a little room, but then he
[1:58:13] stepped through. He broke into their
[1:58:15] little religious what's going on and the
[1:58:17] world's falling apart and we live in
[1:58:19] such a bad day and we didn't expect it
[1:58:20] to be this way. And he went from that
[1:58:22] then he you know you know the woman come
[1:58:24] from the tomb and they just said it was
[1:58:26] idle tales but then he he stepped in. He
[1:58:29] said here I am. I am alive. I am the
[1:58:32] resurrection and the life. I am the
[1:58:34] dynamics. I'm here to resurrect you. I'm
[1:58:37] here to give you a rapture. I'm here to
[1:58:39] give you salvation. I'm here to pull
[1:58:41] myself in. I'm here to prove my word
[1:58:43] through your life. Amen. So it went from
[1:58:45] a rumor to a reality. I say friends, we
[1:58:48] if you want deity in your midst, welcome
[1:58:51] and receive the word. Now that's a
[1:58:52] quote. IF YOU WANT DEITY TO BE IN YOU,
[1:58:55] NOT A RELIGION, FORGET RELIGION. THE
[1:58:57] REALITY OF THIS WORD. AMEN. THIS MESSAGE
[1:58:59] MUST PUT ON FLESH. AMEN. AND IT IS
[1:59:02] PUTTING ON FLESH. IN 2025, [cheering]
[1:59:04] DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD OR YOUNG YOU ARE,
[1:59:06] YOU GIVING YOUR LIFE TO THE LORD. GOD
[1:59:07] BEGINS TO POUR HIMSELF in and prove
[1:59:09] himself that when people see YOU, THEY
[1:59:11] SEE THIS MADE FLESH.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? God is doing that
[1:59:15] because he's showing you're walking with
[1:59:17] me.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to say God's walking with
[1:59:20] me, but it's another thing to say, I'm
[1:59:22] walking with him.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; See, now you're walking humbly with your
[1:59:27] God. What have you done? You allow the
[1:59:29] word to always be right
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; in every circumstance. That's a humble
[1:59:33] person. Amen. They're not just backward
[1:59:35] and timid and old. clothes and stuff.
[1:59:37] No, they let the word rule them.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah. So what happens now? There's
[1:59:44] something comes within us. Here I am
[1:59:47] Lord. I don't have it on the scripture
[1:59:49] but you know here I am Lord send me that
[1:59:52] I can walk into this world and be a
[1:59:55] living witness.
[1:59:58] Brother Ram says this God is going to
[2:00:01] restore by shining forth the evening
[2:00:03] light what? to restore the whole word of
[2:00:05] God again. The full manifestation of
[2:00:08] Christ in his church. Everything that he
[2:00:11] did just exactly the way he did, it
[2:00:13] would be again in the evening light. See
[2:00:15] what I mean? Oh, isn't that wonderful?
[2:00:19] He's done it. I know I've been preaching
[2:00:21] along these lines for a few weeks, but I
[2:00:22] just want this to anchor in. We're back.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; We're not in Egypt.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON SOME DEAD RELIGIOUS FORM. WE'RE
[2:00:31] NOT IN THE WILDERNESS JUST FIGHTING IN
[2:00:33] CHURCH SPLITS AND TROUBLE AND ALL THESE
[2:00:35] THINGS. NO, WE'VE CROSSED JORDAN. WE'RE
[2:00:37] IN THE PROMISED LAND, THE SON OF MAN.
[2:00:39] WE'RE EATING OFF THE GOOD OF THE LAND.
[2:00:41] WE'RE IN OUR INHERITANCE IN CHRIST.
[2:00:43] EVERY ENEMY THAT COMES AGAINST US MUST
[2:00:45] FALL UNDER OUR FEET. WE'VE SEEN DEMONS
[2:00:47] FALL. WE'VE SEEN DEMONS CAST OUT,
[2:00:49] SICKNESS GONE, COMPLEXES GO, TROUBLES
[2:00:52] LEAVE, THE HOLY GHOST POURED OUT. WE'VE
[2:00:55] SEEN MANY MIGHTY THINGS. WHY? CUZ WE'RE
[2:00:56] LIVING IN THE LAND. AND I'M NOT JUST
[2:00:58] TALKING ABOUT THESE FOUR WALLS. I'M
[2:01:00] TALKING ABOUT YOU. WHEREVER YOU ARE,
[2:01:01] YOU'RE LIVING IN THE LAND. HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:03] WE ARE A RESURRECTION PEOPLE. AMEN. WE
[2:01:06] ARE A PEOPLE. GOD BY HIS GRACE IS CALLED
[2:01:09] TO DO JUSTLY, TO LOVE MERCY, AND TO WALK
[2:01:12] HUMBLY with our God.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The Lord spoke
[2:01:17] this a couple of years ago. Thus sayith
[2:01:18] the Lord. My word came forth in this
[2:01:20] place when you began. If you keep humble
[2:01:22] before me, my word will continue to
[2:01:24] come. It will find souls and they'll
[2:01:27] find rest. That is why I have called you
[2:01:30] again to humble thyself again before me.
[2:01:32] There are souls that need my rest. You
[2:01:34] must be humble. You must be humble
[2:01:35] before me and they shall find their
[2:01:37] rest. I have not left. Amen. So a humble
[2:01:41] a HUMBLE PERSON. AMEN. GOD CAN SPEAK
[2:01:43] THROUGH THAT it his word will find souls
[2:01:47] and they'll find rest. See it's not us
[2:01:49] mechanically
[2:01:51] witnessing. You just be surrendered. you
[2:01:53] all humble and then and then it just
[2:01:55] it's you talking to someone and then God
[2:01:57] just opens the door
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; and you begin to speak to that person
[2:02:00] and God deposits his word. He begins to
[2:02:02] bring it forth and then maybe that just
[2:02:04] it just stops and you go back to your
[2:02:06] day. Then someone else the same thing.
[2:02:08] Who's had that experience?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Say you step into a bubble. The whole
[2:02:12] person just changes you. You can really
[2:02:14] talk to them.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; What is that? That's a humble person.
[2:02:18] It's God's word finding souls.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] Amen. They'll find rest. That's why it's
[2:02:25] so important if we really remain humble,
[2:02:27] if we if we are truly humble people,
[2:02:30] then God can reach through you and get a
[2:02:33] hold of a life. More than having just a
[2:02:35] nice talk about something, God steps in.
[2:02:38] Amen.
[2:02:40] Praise the Lord. I'm nearly done. I'm
[2:02:41] really nearly done. James 4:6. But he
[2:02:45] but he giveth more grace wherewith he
[2:02:47] saith, God resists the proud, but giveth
[2:02:49] grace unto the humble. Amen. Submit
[2:02:51] yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
[2:02:53] devil and he will flee from you. Now the
[2:02:55] word grace in the New Testament it means
[2:02:57] a manner or act abstract or concrete
[2:02:59] literal, figurative or spiritual
[2:03:00] especially the divine influence upon the
[2:03:03] heart and its reflection in the life.
[2:03:06] Amen. So someone who is humble God gives
[2:03:08] grace. He influences that person. He
[2:03:11] rules from their soul. He He influences
[2:03:14] how they speak, their attitude, how they
[2:03:17] think, how they treat people, lost or
[2:03:19] found, bride or not. God gives grace to
[2:03:22] that. How who wants more grace?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Who wants who wants God just to pour
[2:03:26] himself in like never before? Amen. To
[2:03:29] give you such a divine influence that
[2:03:31] when people look at you say that
[2:03:33] person's connected to heaven. What was
[2:03:35] the what was the broadband there at the
[2:03:37] thing? 300 up and 300 down or something.
[2:03:39] You know, incredible internet there
[2:03:41] where we had the wedding. Wouldn't you
[2:03:42] like your connection to be like that
[2:03:45] with you and God? 300 up, 300 down, or
[2:03:47] infinity up, infinity up, whatever
[2:03:49] number. You know, there's just such you
[2:03:51] just you just love the Lord. You're
[2:03:52] walking about your day. Amen. There's
[2:03:54] joy in my soul, and you're just happy.
[2:03:56] And God begins to minister to you
[2:03:58] wherever you are, and you you just
[2:04:00] you're just living a sweet, humble
[2:04:01] Christian life. And God lives.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; God has shown us.
[2:04:09] God has shown us that above all things
[2:04:12] have fervent charity, divine love among
[2:04:14] yourselves, for charity shall cover the
[2:04:17] multitude of sins. This is someone who's
[2:04:20] walking humbly with their God. They just
[2:04:22] want love because the more you have of
[2:04:24] him, the more of him you want others to
[2:04:26] experience. And the more you have of
[2:04:28] him, the more you want, right? So, you
[2:04:30] don't want anything that would jar that
[2:04:33] atmosphere.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; You want nothing that will grieve. You
[2:04:35] don't want any fussing, fighting. If
[2:04:37] there's trouble, you talk about you, but
[2:04:39] you want peace, right? Because you just
[2:04:41] want such an atmosphere where God feels
[2:04:43] so welcome. Hallelujah. You know, you go
[2:04:46] on a trip, there's places you like to
[2:04:48] stop because you've been there before.
[2:04:49] You've enjoyed it. Wouldn't you like it
[2:04:51] if God? Because remember, God is walking
[2:04:53] through this generation. Wouldn't you
[2:04:55] like it if God saying, "I'm going to
[2:04:57] make a trip now through Lady Oia. I'm in
[2:05:00] 2025. I'm going to 2026. Then there's
[2:05:02] going to be the rapture." Hey, if it's
[2:05:03] before Christmas, that'll be nice. But
[2:05:05] you know what I mean. And then and he's
[2:05:07] like, I'm going to make a stop at my
[2:05:10] daughter's house or my son's house in
[2:05:13] their life. They're driving along, man.
[2:05:15] I love to drive with them. And God has
[2:05:17] feelings. God cares. God enjoys our
[2:05:20] presence.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be having a hard day. He
[2:05:23] doesn't look at the hard day you're
[2:05:24] having. He's looking at your heart.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, oh man, they're going through
[2:05:27] something to I just love to be with
[2:05:28] them.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Happy, sad, mad, or glad. Well, glad.
[2:05:31] But, you know, he loves to be with us.
[2:05:33] But wouldn't we like it if God would
[2:05:35] pick out one place? It'd be your place.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to live that kind of a
[2:05:39] life? Oh, we can't have peace in our
[2:05:41] house because of X, Y, and Zed. No, I've
[2:05:43] got better math.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ cancels out
[2:05:48] both sides of the equation. The love of
[2:05:50] God takes away both sides of the
[2:05:51] equation. It destroys the entire
[2:05:53] equation. It destroys your past, your
[2:05:55] grudges, your hurts, ALL THOSE THINGS,
[2:05:58] THOSE PUNCHES you've been receiving by
[2:05:59] the devil. Actually, I pray God just
[2:06:01] open our eyes of understanding. say, "We
[2:06:03] can bypass this. We can live a different
[2:06:05] kind of a life. We don't have to go back
[2:06:07] to where we're from and get into the
[2:06:08] same old rut that we found ourselves in.
[2:06:11] We can do things differently."
[2:06:14] Well, why not?
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I got to swallow my pride. Just
[2:06:17] spit it out, man.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Get rid of the thing. It's not worth
[2:06:20] holding on to.
[2:06:22] Just let God be God.
[2:06:25] Praise the Lord. Let's just Let's just
[2:06:27] finish this, shall we? Can we have the
[2:06:28] musicians? We'll just wrap this up.
[2:06:31] But I trust he's shown you. Amen. God
[2:06:34] bless you, friends.
[2:06:38] Now, when I've read the scripture, I'm
[2:06:39] not trying to teach you anything like
[2:06:41] that you don't know. But there's
[2:06:42] something in our hearts we're like,
[2:06:43] "Yeah, we like to do justly. We like to
[2:06:46] actually have discernment about to
[2:06:48] judge, right, righteously.
[2:06:51] We like to we love mercy." You know, I'm
[2:06:54] sure there's, you know, he's like, "Of
[2:06:56] course, this is this is me, right?
[2:06:59] And we love to walk humbly with our God
[2:07:02] because we know there's power in
[2:07:03] humility.
[2:07:06] So I just want to encourage you friends.
[2:07:08] You want the punches off of you, walk
[2:07:10] like that. Say, "God, change my life."
[2:07:13] That my Christian walk like Enoch was is
[2:07:16] exactly that. That Lord, that scripture
[2:07:19] is now just that's just me. That's just
[2:07:22] my life. Doesn't matter if I'm at work,
[2:07:24] at home, school, job, church, wherever.
[2:07:28] That's me. It's who I am. I can't help
[2:07:32] it. It's your nature in me that's
[2:07:34] produced it. Amen. Let's um let's stand
[2:07:36] this morning, shall we?
[2:07:40] We need to sing that song. God's power
[2:07:42] is alive. Okay. I just that was just so
[2:07:46] powerful on Wednesday. I just enjoyed
[2:07:47] that so much. Amen.
[2:07:50] Okay. Gee, I mean, we could just um
[2:07:55] Okay, we don't necessarily need to sing
[2:07:57] the [music] um first verse. We just
[2:07:58] start singing the chorus. Amen. But
[2:08:00] God's power is alive. Hey, what about
[2:08:02] the truth? What about the light? What
[2:08:06] about this message? Is it still alive?
[2:08:08] It is more alive.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; You know, BROTHER, A PROPHET SEES THINGS
[2:08:13] IN ITS FULL MANIFESTATION, though it's
[2:08:15] seed form when he see, you know, where
[2:08:17] he's living. So he saw you as that bride
[2:08:20] marching upwards in step arrod in God's
[2:08:22] righteousness. He saw the full
[2:08:24] manifestation though it was a seed form
[2:08:26] bride back in that AGE BUT HE SAW YOU
[2:08:29] MARCHING in step. Amen. So I say this
[2:08:32] message is more alive. If you want to
[2:08:34] read the newspaper read this message
[2:08:36] what brother Adam said about Russian all
[2:08:37] everything going on. It's today's news.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. At you the the condition of the
[2:08:43] world everything it's all in the word.
[2:08:45] It was spoken back then 60 years ago.
[2:08:48] Communion, the communion message, I
[2:08:50] think was or the 12th. 60 years ago was
[2:08:52] the last message the prophet preached.
[2:08:53] But it's more real and alive now than it
[2:08:56] was then cuz God and his grace has
[2:08:58] opened up our eyes of understanding.
[2:09:00] [music] Amen. We can walk with him.
[2:09:02] Amen. Amen. Let's sing this, shall we?

[2:09:30] [music]
[2:09:30] that he [singing] started our lives.
[2:09:36] is not [music] just some story.
[2:09:42] God's power is alive.
[2:09:47] People say that I
[2:09:51] [music]
[2:09:52] he has no power.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; They deny that he's living
[2:10:03] things
[2:10:05] alive.
[2:10:09] We can help that they say this
[2:10:14] for they do not understand
[2:10:20] they wonder [music] and reason
[2:10:25] say Jesus was just
[2:10:31] oh what about the truth
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; What about the lights?

[2:11:31] [music] and lost.
[2:11:37] [music] For we have a wish.
[2:11:43] No cloud could hold us back
[2:11:48] to stay faithful Jesus [music]
[2:11:54] and keep [singing] on track.
[2:11:58] So tell me now what about the truth?
[2:12:05] What about [music]
[2:12:07] the lies?
[2:12:11] What about [music]
[2:12:12] the message
[2:12:17] with a silver line?
[2:12:22] Just think about his goodness

[2:16:08] off and tell someone about it, but we go
[2:16:11] to the throne of God. we go into your
[2:16:13] presence, Lord. That Lord, maybe you'll
[2:16:15] tell us why, dear God, that we can
[2:16:17] sympathize and we can feel sorry for
[2:16:19] those who have wronged us, Lord God.
[2:16:20] That we'd have the right attitude
[2:16:22] towards them. That your redeeming love
[2:16:24] can reach them and touch them and heal
[2:16:25] them and remove pains and complexes and
[2:16:28] hurts, Lord God. May you grant that, I
[2:16:30] pray. May we love mercy. May we not love
[2:16:32] strife, Lord. We don't want to love
[2:16:34] strife or pain or trouble, Lord. We want
[2:16:36] to love mercy. And dear God, may we be
[2:16:40] humble, Lord, to walk humbly with you,
[2:16:42] Lord. Allow you to rule our lives. That
[2:16:45] your word is always right, far above our
[2:16:47] feelings, our imaginations, or our
[2:16:50] memories or any of those things. But
[2:16:52] Lord, we want to walk humbly with you,
[2:16:54] Lord. That you can speak, you can live
[2:16:56] through us to get a hold, Lord, you can
[2:16:58] find your children that we can all go
[2:16:59] home. Granted, Father, we love you so
[2:17:02] much. We thank you for this day. I just
[2:17:04] pray dear God, may you bless each one.
[2:17:06] Father, dismiss us with your blessing in
[2:17:08] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
