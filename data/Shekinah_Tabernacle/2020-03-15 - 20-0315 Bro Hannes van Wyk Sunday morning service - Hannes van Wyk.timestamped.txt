[49:45] wonderful fashion you might take your

[49:50] now we appreciate the Lord and his
[49:53] kindness this morning and I greet you in
[49:55] the precious name of Jesus Christ bring
[49:57] greetings from the church the Saints
[49:59] back home and they have been praying for
[50:04] us and we believe that God is in control
[50:06] of every situation I'm thankful to have
[50:09] my precious wife sister user with me
[50:12] here today and good to travel with your
[50:15] wife
[50:22] [Music]
[50:33] [Music]
[50:43] [Laughter]
[51:11] you
[51:15] on man God stays God he sovereign and
[51:20] that's why we love and appreciate him
[51:23] this morning that is is in control and
[51:27] we really thank you for your kindness
[51:31] and taking care of us while we here this
[51:33] weekend we'll be leaving tomorrow
[51:35] morning by God's grace going back to
[51:37] Auckland why we are here because my son
[51:41] has decided that he wants to move got an
[51:44] opportunity in Auckland and God opened
[51:47] some doors and they came and me and
[51:48] sister came with the grandchildren last
[51:50] week or before last week just to travel
[51:54] with them and make sure that they are
[51:55] fine and you have a beautiful country
[51:59] it's lovely and the people are lovely
[52:03] the Saints are lovely you know wherever
[52:05] you go the Saints are the same it's an
[52:08] amazing fact I always say you know what
[52:11] people try and create the denominations
[52:15] or any religious system they try and
[52:17] create people to be the same wherever
[52:20] they are they are established and they
[52:25] battle because they've got men in charge
[52:27] and they make rules and they send out
[52:30] they don't have a headquarters on earth
[52:33] our headquarters is in heaven therefore
[52:36] the Holy Ghost is in charge and what you
[52:39] see around you is really a miracle and I
[52:42] prove that the message is from God
[52:44] because even men trying to do their own
[52:47] thing they can't do it but God in his
[52:49] own sovereign right keep this bride
[52:51] under the word and she's fed she's
[52:54] growing and I always say to the people I
[52:57] don't care if your church is under the
[52:58] tree in Botswana or in a place called
[53:02] Wellington in New Zealand God will feed
[53:04] you he's not a respecter of person he
[53:08] looks at us all the same and that's what
[53:11] we believe in a fivefold ministry we
[53:14] believe in the restored Word and I'm not
[53:20] my heart and I trust it will be a
[53:21] blessing to you all and truly God has
[53:25] been gracious unto us and I'm really
[53:27] thankful to be here by invitation and I
[53:30] believe by God's will God knows what we
[53:33] need and I just pray that God will give
[53:36] us grace and unction this morning and
[53:38] really appreciate the church your pasta
[53:42] and all that God has done for us
[53:44] amen let stand as we turn in our Bibles
[53:48] the Judt chapter 1 verse 3 Jude chapter
[53:54] 1 in verse 3 amen Jude chapter 1 in
[54:07] verse 3 beloved when I gave all
[54:12] diligence to write unto you of the
[54:14] common salvation it was needful of for
[54:17] me to write unto you and exhort you that
[54:20] you should earnestly contend for the
[54:22] faith which was once delivered unto the
[54:26] Saints amen let's pray father as we
[54:30] appreciate you this morning the songs of
[54:33] Zion has been sung the atmosphere has
[54:36] been created of God and not as we come
[54:39] now to this part of father of this
[54:40] service where you need to speak to our
[54:43] hearts I pray Lord that you will take me
[54:45] O God and use me for your benefit for
[54:47] your people's benefit for the kingdom
[54:49] and the glory of the Aisne and know
[54:51] Jesus I pray the words of God that we
[54:53] have read that you will inspire it that
[54:55] you will bring life to they've got
[54:57] because your word says O God that letter
[54:59] will kill us but the Spirit will give us
[55:01] life so this morning Lord I healed
[55:03] myself in the congregation to the asking
[55:06] Lord that you will take full control
[55:07] that you will bless us now God and you
[55:10] will help us and that you will keep us O
[55:12] garden that your you will speak to every
[55:14] heart that we will say wasn't it good to
[55:16] be in the house of the Lord then in the
[55:18] hearts burn as he spoke to us along this
[55:21] wonderful way father we healed ourselves
[55:23] to be asking thy blessings now in Jesus
[55:26] Christ's name Amen amen you may take
[55:29] your seats
[55:31] I just want to take a little subject
[55:35] this morning of your faith and your
[55:38] position in Christ you know what God is
[55:44] a God whenever God says something
[55:46] there's a purpose behind it
[55:47] everything that God gives us there's a
[55:49] reason the Bible that he sends us the
[55:52] word that is that it is not just to make
[55:53] a book full of stories but everything he
[55:56] does there's a purpose and a reason
[55:57] behind it
[55:58] amen now the Prophet says you cannot act
[56:01] with faith until first you know what
[56:03] you're doing you've got to first know
[56:06] what you're doing before you can have
[56:07] faith to do it I mean that's why God
[56:10] sends a revelation that's why God opens
[56:12] the book and give us the revelation
[56:13] because imagine if you had no idea what
[56:16] to do how to receive salvation how will
[56:17] you receive it if somebody if you know
[56:20] in your heart you are lost and you need
[56:22] God how will you find the perfect way to
[56:25] get there that's why the Bible says you
[56:27] know how will they come all that will
[56:29] call upon me will be saved but how will
[56:31] they how will they be able to call if
[56:33] they don't know how to call and how will
[56:35] they know if I don't send somebody to
[56:37] tell them how to call it now how will
[56:39] they not know if I don't send a
[56:40] ministers unto them so God has got a set
[56:43] and pattern in a certain way to do
[56:44] things
[56:45] it will never send an angel from heaven
[56:47] to give you a uie message because he's
[56:50] got a certain pattern of doing things
[56:52] and that pattern can never change and
[56:54] therefore he God is not the author of
[56:56] con God wants you to settle you he wants
[56:59] to
[57:04] from were you going and that is the
[57:06] principle that's why a true son and
[57:08] daughter of God find stability upon the
[57:10] Word of God it's like a solid ground a
[57:13] solid place where you stand that when
[57:15] the wings of doctrine starts to blow
[57:17] around you you know where you're
[57:19] standing and you know where you're going
[57:21] and you know what to believe in because
[57:23] it's revealed to you and God gives you
[57:25] that grace now he says when God's people
[57:28] gets into trouble God always sends him a
[57:30] prophet is the pattern when you're in
[57:33] trouble God sends a profit and that
[57:35] profit comes to deliver aid the message
[57:38] of deliverance a message to
[57:44] the true were to bring them out it's
[57:47] never a time that Scots people ever gets
[57:49] in trouble unless God sends his words
[57:51] and his word as we had this morning came
[57:54] to the prophets and how do you test it
[57:55] to find out whether it's according to
[57:58] the word if it's according to the word
[58:00] then God's Word becomes alive now many
[58:03] might say this is the prophet of our
[58:05] church this is the prophet of our church
[58:07] and two of them contrary one to the
[58:09] other something's got to be wrong that's
[58:11] why God will never send two major
[58:14] prophets at the same time because that
[58:15] will cause major confusion when God
[58:18] sends a prophet it's one prophet and
[58:20] finish amen and that's why we believe
[58:22] our prophet now we must all speak the
[58:25] same thing then we must speak not
[58:26] contrary but count exactly what the word
[58:28] says that's how a true prophet is tested
[58:31] whether he's got the word the Bible says
[58:33] if their testimony is not according to
[58:36] the law and the prophets there's no
[58:38] light in them that's right it's got to
[58:40] be according to the word now in every
[58:43] case God sends a servant a prophet to
[58:46] bring the true word to them and the Word
[58:49] of God is what delivers the people
[58:51] always your deliverance always come from
[58:54] one source only and that is the Word of
[58:56] God no other gimmick no other thing that
[58:59] somebody can work up no emotion nothing
[59:01] else but the true Word of God is always
[59:04] what brings you deliverance and it's
[59:06] stable it's true it's a never it's an
[59:09] ever-changing is this word that is
[59:11] stable now when Gideon's time when he
[59:14] was in trouble the Midianites and the
[59:16] hammerites they came and they they they
[59:18] take took over the land and the enemy
[59:21] put out a challenge and every time the
[59:24] enemy puts out the challenge that
[59:26] challenge must be met so whatever
[59:28] happened if a coronavirus gets placed
[59:31] out there that challenge must be met
[59:33] there will be God's people and God will
[59:35] always meet the challenge of the hour
[59:37] amen in the prophecies the enemy speaks
[59:40] today and tries to say that the days of
[59:42] miracles is past that there is no such
[59:45] thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[59:46] and this is only emotion it's only woke
[59:49] up so the enemy has placed a challenge
[59:52] and when he places a challenge God will
[59:54] always meet that challenge
[59:56] he's never at time where there's a
[59:59] challenge placement God doesn't meet the
[1:00:00] challenge and God allows the challenge
[1:00:03] to be placed to show us the power the
[1:00:06] majesty and his greatness because if
[1:00:09] there's no challenge there is no battle
[1:00:10] there is no victory but with every
[1:00:13] challenge it's a golden opportunity to
[1:00:15] say Lord let me see your power and the
[1:00:18] greater the enemy rises up the greater
[1:00:20] God meets that challenge so doesn't
[1:00:23] matter what happened the worse that
[1:00:25] comes he
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:27] you
[1:02:44] he cannot overstep the boundaries if he
[1:02:47] needs to change it he needs to go back
[1:02:49] to the owner and say Lord I you know I
[1:02:52] need to change it like well Toby went he
[1:02:55] could not go why doesn't he when he came
[1:02:58] to job overstep the boundaries God says
[1:03:01] you can do this
[1:03:02] that's why Satan has got no power the
[1:03:05] only power he has is the power that God
[1:03:07] allows him to do and if the purpose of
[1:03:10] that is to show you the greatness of God
[1:03:13] so he has to come and he came to job and
[1:03:16] he tried him he tested him and each
[1:03:17] failed and he had to come back to the
[1:03:20] one who gave the authority he could not
[1:03:23] overstep Satan is this lines drawn and
[1:03:27] that lies is the purpose is to protect
[1:03:30] you because God knows what you can
[1:03:32] endure God will never taste you above
[1:03:35] what you can endure God's purpose is not
[1:03:37] to destroy you God's purpose is to show
[1:03:39] you the strength the character and the
[1:03:41] beauty that's inside of you that's why
[1:03:44] God says I will never taste you about
[1:03:46] what you can endure never so if anything
[1:03:50] happens to you God will give you power
[1:03:53] and grace to endure you might think it's
[1:03:56] too much for me you might think I can
[1:03:57] never handle this you might you might in
[1:03:59] your flesh you might feel it too much
[1:04:01] but God's Word can never lie he will
[1:04:04] never test you above what you can endure
[1:04:06] and it's not easy tests and trials is
[1:04:10] not easy it's never easy but there's a
[1:04:13] reason and a purpose behind it because
[1:04:15] he says in the day when the enemy comes
[1:04:17] in like a flood I'll raise up the
[1:04:19] standard of the world weighs that
[1:04:22] standard that standards inside of you
[1:04:23] because remember if you look at pressure
[1:04:26] pressure is something that is exerted on
[1:04:29] something from the outside so the
[1:04:32] pressure gets placed upon us as
[1:04:34] believers as the Bride of Christ and the
[1:04:36] pressure increases every day because we
[1:04:38] live in such a evil time for the world
[1:04:41] and it's Satan's Eden but the pressure
[1:04:44] increases but if if there's a one ton
[1:04:47] pressure placed upon your life what does
[1:04:50] God do he increases that same pressure
[1:04:53] inside of you also of one ton and it
[1:04:56] equals
[1:04:57] which makes this zero pressure on a
[1:04:59] believer that's why a believer can
[1:05:01] endure any trial any test any temptation
[1:05:04] because God is the equalizing factor you
[1:05:07] can never overcome in your own power in
[1:05:10] your might you need the grace of God if
[1:05:13] you don't have God's grace inside of you
[1:05:15] in deep trouble but God made a made a
[1:05:17] promise that he says I will equip you I
[1:05:19] will give you the grace that you need in
[1:05:22] this time to living so when the enemy
[1:05:25] places his challenge God meets the
[1:05:27] challenge and Gideon's time there was a
[1:05:29] challenge they took over and God met the
[1:05:31] challenge by sending the word and the
[1:05:34] Prophet says you know what every time he
[1:05:37] sends the word after the Prophet leaves
[1:05:40] the scene the word remains behind
[1:05:42] because it's the word that keeps it's
[1:05:45] the word that is that that that saving
[1:05:47] grace just we're living in a grand time
[1:05:50] that's why we live a wonderful time a
[1:05:54] grand time for the world it's chaos for
[1:05:57] us it's a grand time for a child of God
[1:05:59] it's a wonderful time a grand time
[1:06:02] immediately when the provident of the
[1:06:04] scene what happened the Lord came on the
[1:06:06] scene as soon as John went off the scene
[1:06:08] the Lord came on the scene
[1:06:10] very strange our God works but it does
[1:06:12] it it works in mysterious ways
[1:06:15] therefore you need the mind of Christ in
[1:06:18] your own mind you can never work out
[1:06:19] these things in your own mind you want a
[1:06:21] perfect world in your own mind when I
[1:06:23] become a Christian you know everything
[1:06:25] must be perfect but the reality is when
[1:06:27] you became a Christian chaos breaks out
[1:06:30] around you
[1:06:35] remember that amen it's no guarantee
[1:06:38] that when you become a Christian you
[1:06:40] won't have problems but there's one
[1:06:42] guarantee that you will overcome every
[1:06:44] one of them you will have an anchor you
[1:06:46] will have an hope you will have a desire
[1:06:48] you will have a vision and God will make
[1:06:50] sure that he will keep you and bless you
[1:06:53] Jeremiah 29:11 amen so we have to
[1:06:58] understand what's God's purpose because
[1:07:01] Satan will tell us God frustrates you he
[1:07:04] will come and he will show you to
[1:07:06] disappointments he will show you things
[1:07:08] that went wrong along this journey I can
[1:07:11] tell you many things that went wrong
[1:07:13] along this life's journey many people
[1:07:16] that failed me many people that
[1:07:18] disappointed me but we don't dwell on
[1:07:20] those things because there's better
[1:07:22] things to travel the grace of God the
[1:07:24] beauty of his character you know what
[1:07:26] he's doing in our lives it's much better
[1:07:28] to dwell on those things because those
[1:07:30] are everlasting things that we look at
[1:07:32] amen so all right can I read it
[1:07:37] Jeremiah 29:11 I know the plans that I
[1:07:40] have for you to prosper you not to harm
[1:07:44] you to give you hope and an expected end
[1:07:47] so God has got plans for you
[1:07:50] he says I know the thoughts that I think
[1:07:53] toward you so God knows it I mean he's
[1:07:58] got thoughts about you you know that the
[1:08:01] God that you serve he's got thoughts
[1:08:03] about you you personally not not as a
[1:08:07] church but you as an individual he
[1:08:10] thinks about you like you think about an
[1:08:12] individual he says I know the thoughts
[1:08:14] that I have towards you which means
[1:08:18] these thoughts that are projected
[1:08:19] towards you thoughts that what does God
[1:08:21] think about you this morning if you
[1:08:23] think carefully say I wonder and the
[1:08:26] Bible says it's thoughts of what of
[1:08:30] peace' thoughts of grace thoughts of of
[1:08:36] protection and then he says to bring you
[1:08:40] to an expected end your end is not
[1:08:43] unexpected your head is not uncertain
[1:08:46] your end is
[1:08:47] and that if the Lord comes you gonna go
[1:08:49] in the rapture if you die before that
[1:08:52] he's still gonna call you out of the
[1:08:53] ground you've got a certain end this
[1:08:56] cannot end you but you have a certain in
[1:08:58] its thoughts that God have about you I
[1:09:01] know the plans that I have for you the
[1:09:04] thoughts that I have for you and those
[1:09:07] thoughts of God can never change it does
[1:09:10] not matter what happened it does not
[1:09:11] matter where you go God's thoughts stays
[1:09:13] the same because those thoughts is what
[1:09:15] influence influence our love and
[1:09:17] remember God is never surprised you go
[1:09:21] out here you make an accident or
[1:09:23] something happen you are shocked and
[1:09:24] surprised oh god how did this happen to
[1:09:26] me you are shocked God already knew
[1:09:30] yesterday what's gonna happen to you
[1:09:32] today in fact you only knew that they
[1:09:34] you upon what's gonna happen the rest of
[1:09:36] your life so how can he be shocked and
[1:09:38] if he's not shocked how can you be
[1:09:39] shocked you should trust him to say Lord
[1:09:41] I depend upon you I believe you my faith
[1:09:45] my future is in your hands Lord I am NOT
[1:09:48] gonna listen to myself but I believe in
[1:09:51] this Heavenly Father which is a good
[1:09:53] father which is a beautiful wonderful
[1:09:56] father Exodus 34 24 well for I will cast
[1:10:02] out the nations before you and enlarge
[1:10:05] your borders neither shall any man
[1:10:07] desire your land when you shall go up to
[1:10:10] appear before the Lord your God rise in
[1:10:13] the year so what is he telling them here
[1:10:15] he said to them I will cast out the
[1:10:18] nations before you didn't I say you will
[1:10:21] cast it out he says I will do it I will
[1:10:25] cast them out before you and wherever
[1:10:27] you go that will be yours and when you
[1:10:29] come to worship me don't worry about
[1:10:31] your land staying there unprotected no
[1:10:34] man will be able to take the land that I
[1:10:36] have given you and let me tell you
[1:10:38] clearly this morning no enemy will take
[1:10:40] what God has given you every promise in
[1:10:43] the Bible is yours and no enemy will be
[1:10:45] able to take it from you never ever
[1:10:48] again ever
[1:10:49] doesn't matter what happened because
[1:10:51] remember Satan is a squatter by as you
[1:10:55] get squatters I don't know if you get
[1:10:58] them yet but the
[1:11:00] about how they work is they look for
[1:11:02] vacant land with the owner lesion or
[1:11:05] close that right brother on poor a man
[1:11:08] and they walk and the next morning when
[1:11:10] the owner walks past it there's a little
[1:11:12] shack little little building they can
[1:11:16] build it in one day and the law is like
[1:11:19] such once they put up the roof you can't
[1:11:22] remove them so the target is when they
[1:11:25] move in get the roof up is that right so
[1:11:28] so they move with speed and they once
[1:11:30] the roof is up then you have to go to
[1:11:31] the courts you have to get an eviction
[1:11:34] order and then they must come then you
[1:11:35] must try and find other accommodation
[1:11:37] and it becomes an absolute nightmare but
[1:11:41] the trick was if you find him there when
[1:11:43] he moves in you have to move quickly you
[1:11:47] have to tell him or just remove him
[1:11:49] before he has done anything and that's
[1:11:52] the same of second don't linger when he
[1:11:54] moves in you have to move quickly and
[1:11:56] tell him you are a squatter you are out
[1:11:58] yet this is my position this is my land
[1:12:01] I'm not gonna allow you but we said that
[1:12:04] we entertain you we wonder what I'm
[1:12:06] gonna do next huh no you walk by
[1:12:08] Authority and you walk in there and you
[1:12:10] say this is my land you are out of here
[1:12:13] he jesus name take your key things on
[1:12:15] gold that's how we should treat Satan
[1:12:17] he's a squatter and the promises that
[1:12:20] God has given you you should not allow
[1:12:22] him entertain him or consider him you
[1:12:25] stand there by Victorine by faith to say
[1:12:27] you are out of you in Jesus name
[1:12:29] this is mine God has given it to me amen
[1:12:33] that's what God expect of us don't
[1:12:37] entertain him because the longer you
[1:12:39] entertain him the more you're gonna
[1:12:40] battle to get him out of your life it
[1:12:43] starts of a small thing coming small you
[1:12:47] said mind that's not so harmless and you
[1:12:49] start to entertain him and look at him
[1:12:51] what should I do you know and no the
[1:12:54] longer you wait the more troubles you
[1:12:56] will have because it becomes a
[1:12:58] stronghold and the longer you allow him
[1:13:01] to become stronger on your land more
[1:13:03] problems you'll have to get him out the
[1:13:06] key is when you see him and identify him
[1:13:08] move quickly move Authority and evict
[1:13:10] him a man don't feel sorry for him
[1:13:14] don't feel sorry or pity for him just
[1:13:17] kick him out and tell him go find
[1:13:19] another dwelling place this is not for
[1:13:20] sale that is not for rent nothing amen
[1:13:23] so in large what he says I will cast up
[1:13:26] the nations and I'll enlarge your
[1:13:28] borders so remember that is the
[1:13:30] attribute that God has given us is there
[1:13:33] to enlarge your faith you should never
[1:13:35] be content with your current status you
[1:13:38] should never be content to say this is
[1:13:40] all of it no there's plenty more to be
[1:13:43] had and therefore you should always
[1:13:44] strive to say Lord I need more of you I
[1:13:46] need more faith I need more grace I need
[1:13:48] more faith I know the victory Lord Jesus
[1:13:51] because you said you will enlarge
[1:13:53] whatever I have today I want more
[1:13:56] tomorrow whatever I have of God today I
[1:13:58] need more tomorrow because I am here to
[1:14:01] enlarge my camp
[1:14:02] I'm here to enlarge my faith I'm here to
[1:14:05] enlarge my victory
[1:14:07] amen we're not going backwards we're
[1:14:09] going forward we're not going down we're
[1:14:11] going up and therefore we have to
[1:14:13] enlarge everyday our desire should be
[1:14:15] Lord it's wonderful what I see today but
[1:14:18] wait till tomorrow I am expecting more
[1:14:20] I'm expecting to see God I'm expecting
[1:14:23] victory amen
[1:14:25] but Satan wants us to just be happy of
[1:14:30] the status quo but we should never be
[1:14:33] properties you know men always strives
[1:14:36] to be better that's why you always find
[1:14:38] better cars if you look at fifty years
[1:14:41] back the cars that they made you know if
[1:14:44] you look at them today it's like nobody
[1:14:47] wants it maybe if you're a collector
[1:14:49] you'll put it in the garage for memories
[1:14:52] and whatever but you compare those cars
[1:14:54] 50 years back to today's cars it's a
[1:14:56] it's a it's two worlds apart where does
[1:14:59] that come from it comes from men's
[1:15:01] desire to better himself he says and
[1:15:04] that attribute comes from God because
[1:15:06] God is perfect we come from perfection
[1:15:09] and we going back to perfection
[1:15:10] he says that's why men will never stop
[1:15:13] to better themselves it's an attribute
[1:15:16] that God gave them but we as Christians
[1:15:19] we have that attribute in the right way
[1:15:20] you say my perfection is in Jesus Christ
[1:15:23] I am looking to be perfect like he's
[1:15:26] perfect
[1:15:27] I'll be perfect it is his perfection a
[1:15:30] man you can be perfect because he's
[1:15:32] perfect but we have to desire that
[1:15:35] expansion it must be a need in your
[1:15:38] heart it must be something to say but I
[1:15:40] I want it I desire it I need it I I i I
[1:15:44] long for that expansion and it comes
[1:15:47] that's how change comes by a burning
[1:15:50] desire that all I need more of you
[1:15:52] I need a got you to help me you need to
[1:15:56] come to a point where you know I need
[1:15:58] more than I have today amen and then
[1:16:01] when the desire is there then you have
[1:16:03] to act upon the desire you have to get
[1:16:08] up and walk you have to get up and do
[1:16:10] something you know we should not be just
[1:16:12] stagnant we should rise and say Lord I
[1:16:14] need more I've got a desire for more so
[1:16:17] I'm gonna start acting that I'm gonna
[1:16:19] receive more I'm gonna start walking
[1:16:20] because the promise is wherever the
[1:16:23] soles of your feet goes that belongs to
[1:16:26] you you cannot stand stagnant I need
[1:16:28] more you should say Lord I need more I'm
[1:16:30] gonna take it by faith and then you
[1:16:31] start to walk into every promise that
[1:16:33] God has given you it needs action action
[1:16:38] remember we should not be lazy we should
[1:16:41] not be content in that matter we are
[1:16:45] content with God's grace and what is
[1:16:47] done but we should not be lazy
[1:16:48] we should always strive to say Lord give
[1:16:51] me more of that grace make me a better
[1:16:53] Christian make me a better husband make
[1:16:57] me a better wife make me a better child
[1:16:59] make me a better preacher make me put
[1:17:02] ever lot better in every sense for your
[1:17:04] glory and for your honor amen it's like
[1:17:08] j-job is his prayer in 1 chronicles 4:10
[1:17:12] he cried unto God he says o God of
[1:17:15] Israel that you would bless me and
[1:17:18] enlarge my coasts that your hand might
[1:17:22] be with me and that you would keep me
[1:17:23] from evil and that it may not grieve me
[1:17:27] why did job has do that he was the son
[1:17:31] of God
[1:17:32] he was the son of God he was blessed but
[1:17:36] he wanted more
[1:17:38] you wanted more of God increase me give
[1:17:42] me more grace give me more of thyself
[1:17:46] give me our God and don't let it grieve
[1:17:48] me but then it's satisfy me let it make
[1:17:51] me stronger amen because your
[1:17:54] enlargement is in God's hands God says I
[1:17:58] will enlarge your territory God wants to
[1:18:02] do it God God wants it's part of his
[1:18:05] plan for us but that's why I said in the
[1:18:08] beginning we have to understand what's
[1:18:09] God's plan you have to know what God
[1:18:11] wants for you to have faith in it and
[1:18:13] for you to walk in it that gives you
[1:18:15] that gives you an unction to know that
[1:18:17] I'm in the will of God when I ask for
[1:18:19] more I mean the will of God when I ask
[1:18:21] him to bless me more I'm in the will of
[1:18:24] God 1 chronicles 19 verse 13
[1:18:32] 1 chronicles 19 verse 13 be of good
[1:18:36] courage and let us behave yourself
[1:18:39] valiantly for our people and for the
[1:18:42] cities of our God and let the Lord do
[1:18:44] that which is good in his sight so yea
[1:18:47] the army comes in of the enemy lot of
[1:18:50] them gathered together against God's
[1:18:51] people go read the whole passage at home
[1:18:54] and show up so the battle was against
[1:18:56] him and he started to encourage the
[1:18:58] people he tells them be of good courage
[1:19:02] he tells them let us behave ourselves
[1:19:06] valiantly for our people for the cities
[1:19:10] of God and let the Lord do that which is
[1:19:13] good in his sight so why does he say
[1:19:15] that because your behavior has got an
[1:19:18] influence on the people around you your
[1:19:20] behavior as a Christian has got a
[1:19:22] profound influence on your family and
[1:19:25] then the believers are on their church
[1:19:27] what happens if we are in battle I
[1:19:30] believe we are in battle you know you're
[1:19:32] in a battle
[1:19:35] surely we are in a battle the battle is
[1:19:37] heavy it's raging some of us are
[1:19:41] bleeding but we are still in the battle
[1:19:43] so imagine we standing in the frontline
[1:19:46] and we the enemy we are fighting the
[1:19:49] enemy and we have got a line here and
[1:19:51] all of us together all of us here this
[1:19:53] morning of front-line battle soldiers
[1:19:56] every one of you yeah you are a
[1:19:59] frontline soldier so we are standing
[1:20:01] shoulder to shoulder because we need to
[1:20:04] show the enemy unity because the enemy's
[1:20:07] tactic is to fight and conquer that's
[1:20:10] why he likes to isolate you pull you
[1:20:12] from the church or pull you separate or
[1:20:14] put you some on some by the big thing or
[1:20:16] whatever he wants to but these purposes
[1:20:18] once he can separate you he's got you
[1:20:21] because the enemy always focus on those
[1:20:23] that are separated and alone and so on
[1:20:25] and then he attacks onto them but as if
[1:20:28] you stand shoulder to shoulder he knows
[1:20:30] you're a united front and he knows that
[1:20:33] you understand where your strength comes
[1:20:35] from so you stand there and we stand out
[1:20:37] we say today's gonna be a wonderful
[1:20:39] battle and I can't wait for the first
[1:20:42] verse
[1:20:43] first shots to be fired and you're
[1:20:46] already all briefing line up and the
[1:20:48] next moment that the the soldier next
[1:20:50] you start to cry oh my and he's weeping
[1:20:55] bitterly and you ask him but what's
[1:20:58] wrong
[1:20:58] and he says today we're gonna die
[1:21:01] there's enemies to pick and he cries
[1:21:06] terribly and he scream more god help me
[1:21:09] I'm too weak and I am listen that and
[1:21:11] he's crying bitterly not long the
[1:21:14] person's next to him will also cry
[1:21:16] because that influences we asking but
[1:21:19] why is he crying he knows something that
[1:21:21] I don't know what couldn't it today's
[1:21:23] trouble and so that that influence split
[1:21:26] down the line and before long the whole
[1:21:28] church is in panic that's why he says
[1:21:32] you have to behave with courage even if
[1:21:38] you think you know I don't know how we
[1:21:39] gonna do it but by the grace of God you
[1:21:41] have to stand with courage to say you
[1:21:43] know what I can't do it but my God says
[1:21:45] he will never leave me no forsake me he
[1:21:47] will be with me even in me I take
[1:21:49] courage from my god and your courage
[1:21:52] encourage two 1x2 you put your arms
[1:21:54] around that brother or sister and say
[1:21:56] brother
[1:21:56] don't worry this battle is not yours its
[1:21:59] gods he will fight for you he will take
[1:22:01] control he will fight it for you and
[1:22:04] that encouragement when will foot so
[1:22:07] don't wait and see who's crying or not
[1:22:09] if somebody is crying immediately in
[1:22:12] college if somebody is weak immediately
[1:22:15] in college because that weak one will
[1:22:18] cost you the battle so you must
[1:22:22] understand my role is to identify to
[1:22:25] help sometimes maybe somebody is weak
[1:22:28] then you must intercede help make him
[1:22:32] strong being of good courage and
[1:22:34] behaving ourselves valiantly so the word
[1:22:38] courage means to be alert physically and
[1:22:42] mentally to be agile to be quick to be
[1:22:44] energetic Amen so if you want to
[1:22:48] encourage somebody show him that you
[1:22:50] believe in this God show him that you
[1:22:53] believe the word to him that you believe
[1:22:55] the message
[1:22:56] by friends a brother don't worry out
[1:22:58] stand in front of you I'll take the
[1:22:59] bullet for you brother
[1:23:01] I believe that my God can do it it
[1:23:04] becomes then that college Dean rubs off
[1:23:06] on him then he was start using my that's
[1:23:09] a wonderful attitude I'm gonna have the
[1:23:11] same attitude and imagine a Church of
[1:23:13] God having an attitude of courage that I
[1:23:15] don't care I'll preakness enemies
[1:23:17] I've got courage to face him it gives us
[1:23:21] grace prophecies in the message
[1:23:24] witnesses he says it's like old buddy
[1:23:26] Robertson said Lord give me the backbone
[1:23:29] like a saw log that's the kind of
[1:23:31] witnesses to be kind God likes us to be
[1:23:35] courageous it's an attribute that God
[1:23:39] loves when his children becomes
[1:23:41] courageous not in their own ability to
[1:23:43] know that you know I am actually weak
[1:23:46] but he is strong since when I am weak he
[1:23:49] is strong so that gives me courage to go
[1:23:51] and stand right in the front line right
[1:23:54] in the front line I don't want to be the
[1:23:56] pack I want to be right in the front
[1:23:57] line anyway you can smell the back where
[1:24:02] you can feel the heat we went to the
[1:24:04] museum yeah yesterday what do they call
[1:24:06] the museum the Papa and they had a
[1:24:11] display there of the soldiers the big
[1:24:15] statues and how they the battle was
[1:24:17] going in white was so real those statues
[1:24:21] those men they made there was so soul of
[1:24:23] you you feel like they're gonna stand up
[1:24:25] any moment and talk to you but you can
[1:24:28] see the agony you can see they were
[1:24:29] experienced how they experienced that
[1:24:32] frontline battle but that God wants us
[1:24:35] to be good rageous to stand him to know
[1:24:38] because remember where the enemy looks
[1:24:40] at you he examines the wall front line
[1:24:43] he's looking for the weak one looking
[1:24:46] for the weak spot that's why the Church
[1:24:49] of God should be all courageous and
[1:24:50] stand there even if you are the weakest
[1:24:52] one in the church your courage come from
[1:24:54] God you have to stand there and trust
[1:24:57] and depend that's why you know in our
[1:24:59] days when I was a young boy my dad and
[1:25:02] then his brothers and though
[1:25:03] they used to look what I like to watch
[1:25:07] the boxing
[1:25:08] you know so and they would be interested
[1:25:12] who's gonna win and whose car what but
[1:25:14] the whole city but there's all
[1:25:16] preparation before the fight even starts
[1:25:19] you know they get into the ring these
[1:25:21] two guys and they've got the trainer's
[1:25:22] then the trainer psyches them up and you
[1:25:24] know tell him how good he is and not
[1:25:25] wonderfully isn't this is that and then
[1:25:27] he comes and the next moment what do
[1:25:29] they do they come to the middle of the
[1:25:31] ring and they go and stand in front of
[1:25:34] one another but face to face like that
[1:25:40] and he looks if you look him in the eye
[1:25:42] you don't blink why because you want to
[1:25:45] show him I'm not scared imagine you
[1:25:48] hiding in the corner there and you're
[1:25:50] already showing him my goodness I don't
[1:25:52] know what you're gonna do to me but I'm
[1:25:53] already shaking that man oh the battle
[1:25:56] is over before it even started but if
[1:25:59] you walk in there like the Prophet
[1:26:01] Calise victory walk and you're walking
[1:26:03] there and you come and stand right in
[1:26:04] front of Satan you tell him today I am
[1:26:06] here in the name of the Lord
[1:26:08] I'm in business today he knows he's in
[1:26:10] for a fight he knows that you know who
[1:26:12] you are it gives us and that's why God
[1:26:16] loves us the Prophet says to be
[1:26:17] courageous to know you know if you're in
[1:26:20] a battle then you have to have the
[1:26:22] attributes of a soldier which is courage
[1:26:25] it taught you sure before he crossed
[1:26:27] over he says be thou very not just
[1:26:31] courageous but for this battle you need
[1:26:34] to be very courageous and for this end
[1:26:36] time living battle you need to be very
[1:26:39] courageous you need to trust in this
[1:26:42] Living God well you will say if God will
[1:26:46] tell me like he did Joshua I would have
[1:26:49] some courage too he says he has told
[1:26:52] every believer the same thing God has
[1:26:55] told you to be very courageous so if God
[1:26:58] told you that you can believe him but
[1:27:01] then you have to act on it and become
[1:27:03] courageous become courageous and stand
[1:27:07] there amen because remember courage
[1:27:10] means the ability to face and deal with
[1:27:13] dangerous or difficult situations so if
[1:27:17] there's no dangerous situations you can
[1:27:19] never be courageous
[1:27:21] you don't need courage when there is no
[1:27:23] problem if everything is fine and the
[1:27:27] bank is full of money the cars full of
[1:27:29] petrol you know everybody's healthy you
[1:27:33] know everything is just bites like
[1:27:35] heaven on earth but you need courage
[1:27:39] that's why problems come in in different
[1:27:43] forms all of a sudden somebody will
[1:27:45] become sick all of a sudden somebody
[1:27:48] will lose their job all of a sudden God
[1:27:51] allows those things because if God
[1:27:53] hasn't allow it we will have heaven on
[1:27:56] earth because we will no need courage if
[1:27:58] it will be everything will be perfect
[1:27:59] but God allows those things to come for
[1:28:02] that courageous attribute to come out of
[1:28:04] you that you can say my now I need to
[1:28:07] have courage because I'm facing a
[1:28:09] dangerous situation I'm facing a problem
[1:28:12] and that brings out courage that's why
[1:28:15] if that never happens you will never
[1:28:16] know who you are
[1:28:17] the things that happen to us is there to
[1:28:20] identify him to bring out the characters
[1:28:23] the things that God wants us to see so
[1:28:27] there's two parts to this he says the
[1:28:29] first part is to face the dangerous
[1:28:32] situation and the neck of the next part
[1:28:35] is to deal with it you know we we our
[1:28:38] people are funny amen when we we we we
[1:28:45] don't like to face difficult situations
[1:28:47] we run away and we rather ignore it
[1:28:50] hope it's gonna go away but he says the
[1:28:54] the victory lies in to face it and deal
[1:28:57] with it if you've got a problem in your
[1:29:01] life face it and deal with it if you
[1:29:04] have an issue face it and deal with it
[1:29:06] that's part of the victory you're gonna
[1:29:09] run for a long time that thing will
[1:29:11] follow you wherever you go
[1:29:12] but facing it and dealing with it there
[1:29:15] is the courageous victory that God wants
[1:29:17] us to do amen
[1:29:19] mark chapter 11 verse let's take it from
[1:29:27] verse 12
[1:29:29] macht checked eleven was 12
[1:29:32] now Jesus is speaking here or there
[1:29:36] relating the Bible says mark 1112 says
[1:29:40] and on the morning when they will come
[1:29:43] from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a
[1:29:47] fig tree afar off having leaves he came
[1:29:50] if haply he might find anything there on
[1:29:53] and when he came to it he found nothing
[1:29:56] but leaves for the time of figs was not
[1:29:59] yet and jesus answered and said unto it
[1:30:02] no man each fruit of the hereafter
[1:30:05] forever and his disciples heard it now
[1:30:08] he comes he knows it's not trick time
[1:30:11] he's like by a certain time of the
[1:30:14] others lemons there's oranges if you go
[1:30:17] in the middle of summer you don't find
[1:30:19] it because it's not the season so here
[1:30:22] it comes to a tree he's grown up there
[1:30:24] he knows exactly they won't be any fruit
[1:30:26] day but he's expecting fruit and that's
[1:30:30] a God is he's expecting fruit in season
[1:30:34] and out of season you can't say I live
[1:30:36] in Lodi sure it's impossible to bear
[1:30:38] fruit God knows he's impossible but he
[1:30:40] knows he's given you the ability by His
[1:30:42] grace to bear fruit well it's impossible
[1:30:45] he will want fruit from your life even
[1:30:49] in a desert he wants fruit from your
[1:30:52] life because your roots should go into
[1:30:54] the stream of life your energy should
[1:30:58] not come from this it should come from
[1:31:00] him so when you are tapped into God you
[1:31:03] can bear fruit in a desert it doesn't
[1:31:05] matter how tried is around here you'll
[1:31:07] be like a green tree you'll be like an
[1:31:10] oasis verse 20 and in the morning as
[1:31:12] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[1:31:14] dried up from the roots you see where
[1:31:16] they cursed it from from the roots it
[1:31:20] started to dry up and Beach according to
[1:31:22] remembrance said and we master behold
[1:31:24] the fig tree which thou cursive is worth
[1:31:27] that away and jesus answered and said
[1:31:31] unto him have faith in God
[1:31:34] so now the
[1:31:37] he says have faith in God for verily I
[1:31:40] say unto you that whatsoever shall say
[1:31:43] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[1:31:45] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[1:31:48] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:31:49] that those things which he said shall
[1:31:52] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:31:55] saith amen whatsoever thou shall say
[1:32:00] unto this mountain so I want you to
[1:32:03] carefully understand yet God is specific
[1:32:06] it doesn't say what you ever you shall
[1:32:08] say unto a mountain this mountain which
[1:32:12] means it's it's identified God is very
[1:32:16] specific always you will find him now
[1:32:20] you see you have to believe he says
[1:32:25] whatsoever you
[1:32:29] a mountain visa is a symbol of anything
[1:32:32] in your life any problem any situation
[1:32:36] anything that's there is a mountain that
[1:32:38] you have to overcome so the prod that
[1:32:41] the thing is you have to identify it you
[1:32:44] have to know so what we do normally we
[1:32:47] don't speak to the mountain we spit out
[1:32:50] the mountain oh my I have got so much
[1:32:53] problems we speak about our problems day
[1:32:55] in and day out I tell every all goodness
[1:32:57] and we speak about the mountain let me
[1:33:01] say if you will speak about the mountain
[1:33:03] he will cast himself into the sea
[1:33:05] he doesn't say if you speak to somebody
[1:33:07] else about the mountain it will
[1:33:08] disappear he say if you will speak to
[1:33:11] this mountain he will have results
[1:33:14] that's why we fail many times because we
[1:33:17] we don't take God's program you have to
[1:33:20] say where's my mountain identified and
[1:33:22] give it a name and say I'm speaking to
[1:33:26] this mountain amen
[1:33:28] specific because you can speak generally
[1:33:31] about Satan he won't he won't even blink
[1:33:33] an eye you will speak about about your
[1:33:36] problem Satan won't move but when you
[1:33:39] call his name that's why I mean in the
[1:33:41] discernment when the Prophet was doing
[1:33:43] the sermon he will pray for somebody
[1:33:45] with heart trouble what are you
[1:33:46] identified he starts to identify that
[1:33:50] demon and he starts to address that
[1:33:52] demon he speaks to this mountain and in
[1:33:55] this mountain calls on another one for
[1:33:57] help and so they start to communicate
[1:33:59] but you have to address that one and
[1:34:01] then when you address that one the
[1:34:03] others start to get fearful and then he
[1:34:05] address one by one says that one has got
[1:34:08] heart trouble that one has got heart
[1:34:10] trouble that one has got out trouble and
[1:34:11] they are all healed because he's
[1:34:14] starting to address them and that's what
[1:34:15] Satan doesn't like it when you identify
[1:34:18] that mountain and you start to come to
[1:34:20] that mountain and you take that script
[1:34:22] you say the Lord says if I shall say to
[1:34:25] this mountain then Satan start to fear
[1:34:29] he says if you shall say to now think
[1:34:32] about an example David David a young man
[1:34:35] anointed king he knew who he was after
[1:34:38] he was anointed you believe me
[1:34:41] he had faith in the Prophet that the
[1:34:45] Prophet didn't make a mistake when he
[1:34:47] anointed him King so after the Prophet
[1:34:50] anointed him what does David do he
[1:34:53] carries on with his normal day-to-day
[1:34:55] life he doesn't come to the palace and
[1:34:57] say here's my office trying to put
[1:35:00] himself into the office he know if God
[1:35:03] called me God will place me and God will
[1:35:05] move me and God will use me and God will
[1:35:07] do all these things so easy relaxed man
[1:35:10] and he's just going about his business
[1:35:11] and his father says listen take the
[1:35:14] Russians take the food to your brothers
[1:35:17] and he's happily going taking the food
[1:35:19] he since the carrier and when he comes
[1:35:22] the egg out comes Goliath and Goliath
[1:35:25] stands Denny boasts anyone of you fight
[1:35:28] me if they weren't will serve you if I
[1:35:30] went you'll serve us and you know he's
[1:35:32] just posting and making a video girl of
[1:35:34] them and where do you find God's people
[1:35:37] no courage that's why David was a man
[1:35:42] after God's own heart he had courage he
[1:35:45] had that understanding God loved him he
[1:35:47] had many mistakes he had plenty that you
[1:35:49] can put God loved him because he had
[1:35:52] courage he had a love for God he knew
[1:35:54] his own position so he stands there and
[1:35:58] he's explaining excited because he's
[1:35:59] gonna see a battle and he's trust him
[1:36:03] who's gonna fight him and I say God you
[1:36:06] just yet to make trouble because he's
[1:36:08] excitement was a condemnation to them
[1:36:10] and don't let you know sometimes when
[1:36:13] believers get too excited others get
[1:36:15] upset because it's maybe a condemnation
[1:36:17] to them just know that God loves it when
[1:36:20] you are encouraged and when you are when
[1:36:22] you are as somebody that stands for the
[1:36:24] word don't let somebody push you down
[1:36:26] just raise up above it and say father by
[1:36:29] your grace and David says who's gonna
[1:36:32] fight him and they make skews they try
[1:36:34] to send him away but he refuses because
[1:36:36] he's there to see the battle because the
[1:36:38] enemy has made the challenge remember
[1:36:42] what I read in the beginning prophet
[1:36:44] says when the enemy makes a challenge
[1:36:45] God will always meet the challenge
[1:36:48] so whenever he challenges you earth God
[1:36:50] will meet that challenge that is a fact
[1:36:53] you can believe it and he says no if you
[1:36:56] won't go I'll go
[1:36:57] and it comes to the king there's a young
[1:37:00] man he's ready to go and the King calls
[1:37:03] him he says my that's wonderful news but
[1:37:05] you don't have armor you don't have been
[1:37:07] take my homage the best that the
[1:37:10] military military can produce and he
[1:37:13] puts it on and we know how he just said
[1:37:15] but I can't go with his in I'm
[1:37:16] uncomfortable so when you go and fight
[1:37:19] this enemy do try new gimmicks don't try
[1:37:22] new things that you can buy only water
[1:37:25] on the internet or do this or do that
[1:37:27] just take it in the in the way that has
[1:37:29] never failed the Word of God before you
[1:37:32] and that's it plain and simple he says
[1:37:36] no remove this from me I know the God
[1:37:39] that saved my ship from the bear that
[1:37:42] saved him from the lion that used me
[1:37:44] that's the God I trust and as he comes
[1:37:47] now you you must carefully notice he
[1:37:49] comes through he picks up the five
[1:37:50] stones his God ease his slingshot and as
[1:37:54] he comes he starts to apply that if you
[1:37:57] will say to this mountain he starts to
[1:38:00] call gloves name because he want Goliath
[1:38:03] to understand that I'm talking to you
[1:38:05] not to the whole army not to I'm talking
[1:38:08] to you he said to him he said to him
[1:38:10] when Goliath so he says I'm coming to
[1:38:13] you to you Goliath he identifies him and
[1:38:16] he tells him in no uncertain terms you
[1:38:18] your name is my list and he says I'm
[1:38:22] coming to you in the name of the Lord
[1:38:24] and then he goes further he starts to
[1:38:27] tell him what is he gonna do with him
[1:38:29] that's what God you want to tell your
[1:38:31] enemy I'm coming to you in the name of
[1:38:33] the Lord and I'm gonna do this to you
[1:38:36] I'm gonna cost you out I'm gonna remove
[1:38:38] you from this place I'm gonna do this he
[1:38:41] says I am gonna kill you to take
[1:38:46] it doesn't save God give me clay so I
[1:38:48] hope I'm gonna kill you oh my if I fight
[1:38:50] he just come and he stood firm
[1:38:53] courageous because remember God will
[1:38:55] pack you up if you come by faith God
[1:38:57] will never never never leave you he will
[1:39:00] back you all the way from your right to
[1:39:02] the battle is I come to you in the name
[1:39:06] of the road and today I'm gonna kill you
[1:39:08] and in fact today I'm gonna cut off your
[1:39:11] head and I'm gonna lift it for the
[1:39:14] nations to see so what is he doing he's
[1:39:17] pronouncing the battle before it happens
[1:39:20] and those words then become effective
[1:39:24] those words are out in the air and now
[1:39:26] God knew this is what David's health the
[1:39:31] battle was clear the outcome was to find
[1:39:34] everything was there and Goliath is
[1:39:40] upset says is this the best you can
[1:39:42] produce a young man if he felt insulted
[1:39:46] he felt there was no match that's why
[1:39:50] God will never use your ability God will
[1:39:53] strip you of every ability that you
[1:39:55] think you have that when you stand in
[1:39:57] front of him that day you will know it's
[1:39:59] only the grace of God but I'm ready to
[1:40:01] be courageous and he comes any any and
[1:40:04] Goliath curses him and us
[1:40:06] but David has pronounced the battle he
[1:40:09] identified the enemy he told him he's
[1:40:12] gonna kill him and he told him how he's
[1:40:14] gonna kill him I'm gonna cut off your
[1:40:16] head I'm gonna lift it up now remember
[1:40:19] how do you I mean how you cannot cut his
[1:40:22] head off if he's still alive because
[1:40:25] David is small this man was huge a giant
[1:40:29] but if a giant flesh flat on the floor
[1:40:32] it's easy to step on him you know so the
[1:40:35] purpose is to first get him in the right
[1:40:37] position so they were try the slingshot
[1:40:39] and I believe that it wasn't David's
[1:40:42] ability in the slingshot because
[1:40:44] remember that giant skull was so thick
[1:40:46] you can throw that stone at any speed it
[1:40:49] can never penetrate a skull like that it
[1:40:52] might give him a little red dot but
[1:40:55] that's it
[1:40:56] but he had confidence in God and he
[1:40:59] starts to wind up the slingshot and I
[1:41:01] believe even if he let it go backwards
[1:41:03] the Holy Spirit would have turned that
[1:41:06] stone and given it supernatural power
[1:41:09] and it penetrated his head and the only
[1:41:11] comes and David now doesn't start to
[1:41:15] rejoice because remember he knows what
[1:41:18] is expected here pronounced what he's
[1:41:20] gonna do it doesn't stop halfway and
[1:41:22] that's the thing many times we stop too
[1:41:24] early many times we are so excited that
[1:41:27] the giant went down we stopped off with
[1:41:29] God don't want you to stop halfway he
[1:41:32] wants you to complete the task I mean he
[1:41:36] wants you to be dedicated he want you to
[1:41:38] understand I am here to destroy this
[1:41:40] enemy I am here to take him out not just
[1:41:43] to wound him I'm here to take his head
[1:41:46] off that is the purpose of the bride is
[1:41:49] to take his head
[1:41:53] under your feet completely defeated
[1:41:56] everything now I'm sure the the the
[1:42:02] soldiers behind him was ready shouting
[1:42:03] and screaming but he knew he went
[1:42:06] forward he took showed them he had to
[1:42:11] complete the task
[1:42:13] like when Elijah was there and he was
[1:42:15] busy dying and his last days he was sick
[1:42:18] and the king came to him he says you
[1:42:20] know what what is gonna happen to us the
[1:42:22] enemy is fighting us tell us tell me
[1:42:25] what what what what is the future and
[1:42:27] the Prophet says take the bow and arrow
[1:42:29] and shoot it through the window and he
[1:42:32] said to him King take the arrow and hit
[1:42:34] the ground the King took the arrow neat
[1:42:37] which one two three and he stopped and
[1:42:42] the Prophet was upset is why did you
[1:42:45] stop at number three why don't just
[1:42:47] continue to hit the ground five six
[1:42:49] seven times because he then you would
[1:42:51] have destroyed the enemy completely now
[1:42:54] you'll only have three victories and
[1:42:55] they will be G God don't give us
[1:43:01] beforehand everything you want you to
[1:43:03] act by inspiration he want you to be
[1:43:06] courageous you want you to stand there
[1:43:08] as a son of God and he looks at your
[1:43:09] action and he's pleased when you start
[1:43:13] to act like your David and David took
[1:43:16] his head off and it was a glorious
[1:43:19] victory so how do we do the same thing
[1:43:22] the first thing you have to identify
[1:43:24] that mountain identify the problem in
[1:43:28] your life and give it a name if it's
[1:43:33] lust if it's you know stealing if it's
[1:43:35] anything give it the lightning because
[1:43:39] once you have the name you can focus on
[1:43:41] it yes don't say the devil is a problem
[1:43:43] in my life which one that's plenty
[1:43:47] if you speak to this one the other one
[1:43:49] said no he's not speaking to me speaking
[1:43:50] to you but when you call his name he
[1:43:53] can't run he can't hide your coming to
[1:43:56] him and that's why we have to be
[1:43:57] specific and identify him
[1:44:01] identifying then he knows his pattern is
[1:44:04] pushed you coming
[1:44:06] he can't run he can't hide I can't do
[1:44:08] anything and that's why if you have a
[1:44:09] problem that's the way to deal with it
[1:44:11] come and say I have a problem and the
[1:44:13] problem is this then everybody know okay
[1:44:18] we are dealing with this problem not
[1:44:20] just general I have all of us has got
[1:44:23] problems but specific give him that name
[1:44:27] that you get that when you speak you
[1:44:29] speak tree then you must be very clear
[1:44:33] on what you want come and beat Lord I
[1:44:37] need this devil ripped from my life
[1:44:40] I need this out of my family I need it
[1:44:44] not to hinder I need it you must be
[1:44:46] clear like a David he was clear I need
[1:44:49] to cut his head off and so you must be
[1:44:51] I'm gonna I'm here to kill him be clear
[1:44:57] what you want and be clear on the result
[1:45:00] you want
[1:45:01] David was clear and what he wants and
[1:45:04] the result he wants to achieve because
[1:45:07] remember there is power in your words
[1:45:11] the prophecies there's a power inside of
[1:45:13] you that can create another by faith you
[1:45:16] can do so you understand that if I speak
[1:45:20] if I can speak those things there's a
[1:45:22] power behind what I've said and then if
[1:45:24] I've done it under inspiration and done
[1:45:26] it according to the Word of God God will
[1:45:28] back it up and so the enemy also knows
[1:45:31] that so he's scared when you start to go
[1:45:33] down this line then you have to go and
[1:45:36] place yourself positionally David wasn't
[1:45:39] sitting in the tent throwing the rock
[1:45:42] from the tent many times we want to sit
[1:45:46] in the tent wait for the battle to
[1:45:48] finish don't call me when it's over
[1:45:52] after the prayer meeting call me after
[1:45:55] this call me but he wants you to be
[1:45:57] right in front of the enemy positionally
[1:46:01] because since this battle is not yours
[1:46:03] but then he tells them tomorrow morning
[1:46:05] early gold place yourself in front of
[1:46:08] the enemy you'll see me in battle but
[1:46:10] you have to be a witness that God is a
[1:46:13] mighty battle if you're always in the
[1:46:15] tent you have no witness you
[1:46:17] never seen God in battle you have never
[1:46:19] seen the victory the power when that
[1:46:21] giant falls and the dust Rises that is
[1:46:25] good to see good to be but you can only
[1:46:28] see it in the frontline right there so
[1:46:33] position is important identify be
[1:46:38] specific and tell him what you want and
[1:46:40] also place yourself in front of that
[1:46:42] enemy because God God is a God that
[1:46:44] likes to show his power that's why he
[1:46:47] says to them this battle is not yours
[1:46:49] I'll go and fight for you tomorrow
[1:46:51] so we would expect fine I'll just sit at
[1:46:53] home and wait till the battle is over
[1:46:55] but then God says to him tomorrow
[1:46:57] morning early go and place yourself in
[1:46:58] front of the enemy you need faith to do
[1:47:00] that because you know if God doesn't
[1:47:03] back me up I'm dead because the enemy is
[1:47:05] outnumbered me but they go the early
[1:47:08] morning and they go and stand in front
[1:47:10] of enemy and they start to worship God
[1:47:12] God wants you to worship Him in this
[1:47:15] battle your purpose and your reason is
[1:47:17] to worship Him and tell him how great he
[1:47:19] is how wonderfully is how precious is
[1:47:24] O'Reilly and one we start to worship the
[1:47:27] enemy will start to fall one by one by
[1:47:30] one amen and that says that's the right
[1:47:33] sequence many times we come into God and
[1:47:37] we open the door says Lord I need the
[1:47:38] BMW I need the job I need the money
[1:47:41] barging into the house of all your needs
[1:47:43] God knows you need he knows it better
[1:47:47] than yourself but he says first come and
[1:47:50] worship me first come and tell me first
[1:47:55] come and express your love that's every
[1:47:58] in every battle it starts of worship if
[1:48:01] you want to overcome this enemy it
[1:48:03] starts with worshiping him telling him
[1:48:05] what you are great you are wonderful
[1:48:07] you are kind you are the mighty God then
[1:48:11] God gets presence comes down in fact we
[1:48:17] should leave our problems by the door
[1:48:19] when you come to church on a Sunday
[1:48:21] whenever you come leave your problems
[1:48:23] out like you come to worship
[1:48:26] God knows you're Pro hue if you want you
[1:48:28] worship you'll take care of all your
[1:48:29] problems but Satan tells us no you're
[1:48:32] sitting here you thinking about tomorrow
[1:48:34] but the job and the money or the problem
[1:48:38] at work or the issue or this and Satan
[1:48:40] keeps your mind busy so you're in church
[1:48:43] but you India
[1:48:44] your body is here but your Nadya God
[1:48:48] don't want your body here he wants you
[1:48:50] yeah he wants you to be active involved
[1:48:53] English we want you to leave those
[1:48:56] problems behind when you come to the
[1:48:57] door physically drop them tell the devil
[1:49:00] I'm dropping those big bags of problems
[1:49:02] at the door I am free to worship my god
[1:49:04] and express my love to him amen then you
[1:49:10] have to be patient
[1:49:12] God well God doesn't always move in me
[1:49:17] be patient with him
[1:49:19] he says you have to be patient with God
[1:49:21] because otherwise you know God creates
[1:49:24] spoiled children God every time the
[1:49:26] levers you ask you know what happens to
[1:49:29] your children when they ask and you give
[1:49:31] you asking you give they ask you give
[1:49:33] you create a perception so the next
[1:49:36] moment they're asked and you say no what
[1:49:39] happens big tantrum hitting the floor
[1:49:45] I've got a two and a half year old
[1:49:47] grandson Molly I tell you that man keeps
[1:49:50] us busy you can't negotiate over two
[1:49:53] year old he's got his own mind and when
[1:49:55] we walk in the streets of Oakland he
[1:49:57] walks like this oh if you're picking up
[1:50:02] his things he wants to do his own thing
[1:50:05] and you just have to be patient but God
[1:50:09] don't create spoiled children
[1:50:11] that's why it says pray lord I need this
[1:50:14] in your time if it's your will Lord not
[1:50:18] my will but your will be done I'm
[1:50:20] content Lord you know the best for me
[1:50:22] I am happy Lord to trust you and believe
[1:50:24] you Lord I not just do as you please to
[1:50:27] me I am your child Lord amen Joshua
[1:50:32] chapter 14 verse 10
[1:50:38] Joshua chapter 14 and verse states and
[1:50:45] now behold the LORD hath kept me alive
[1:50:47] as he have said these forty and five
[1:50:50] years even since the Lord speak this
[1:50:52] word unto Moses while the children of is
[1:50:55] I wandered in the wilderness and now lo
[1:50:57] I am this day four score and five years
[1:50:59] old a man who's speaking there it's
[1:51:03] Caleb now Caleb is a type of the bride
[1:51:07] so yeah he's Joshua is Caleb we know how
[1:51:10] they came and the mournful testimony
[1:51:12] they had but he comes to a point where
[1:51:15] they after the 40 years that they've
[1:51:16] traveled in the world as they come back
[1:51:18] again to enter the Promised Land
[1:51:21] now he's got a testimony next verse 11
[1:51:25] as yet I am a strong this day as I was
[1:51:29] in the day that Moses sent me as my
[1:51:32] strength was then even so is my strength
[1:51:35] now for war both to go out and to come
[1:51:38] eat that is a true believer a true
[1:51:41] believer doesn't become weaker and
[1:51:43] weaker
[1:51:43] he becomes stronger and stronger as the
[1:51:46] journey goes on he knows his position
[1:51:49] Caleb knew his position he could have
[1:51:53] been a better man because he was walking
[1:51:55] 40 years in the desert because of other
[1:51:57] people's unbelief if you have that
[1:52:00] attitude you will hate everybody in the
[1:52:02] church I'm only here because your
[1:52:04] unbelief I'm ready for the rapture so
[1:52:07] you're keeping me back sure anything but
[1:52:14] Caleb had a good attitude
[1:52:16] he walked 40 years without complaining
[1:52:18] without murmuring he was a man of
[1:52:20] courage and he courage those around him
[1:52:22] to tell him I've seen the land is a land
[1:52:25] of milk and honey we gonna make it no
[1:52:28] complaining I'm walking with you that's
[1:52:31] why we must be willing to walk with one
[1:52:33] another some are strong some are weak
[1:52:35] but we have to walk together and be an
[1:52:38] encouragement to say brother don't worry
[1:52:40] we gonna make it I tell you there is a
[1:52:42] land
[1:52:44] amen if you're the bride you should be
[1:52:47] like Caleb be encouragement don't murmur
[1:52:50] and complain we can be here for another
[1:52:53] 40 years I hope not
[1:52:56] but no there's no guarantee I remember
[1:52:59] when we came into the message watch 25
[1:53:01] or 27 years ago I thought I just made it
[1:53:05] really I was so happy I said god I think
[1:53:11] it you waited for me let's go but today
[1:53:16] I'm thankful that he waited because many
[1:53:17] came after me so God knows the last one
[1:53:21] and I always say you must love every day
[1:53:25] as if it's today
[1:53:26] but you plant your potatoes as if you're
[1:53:29] gonna be here for another 10 years
[1:53:31] that's the balance that God gives a
[1:53:33] Christian to know and that's why I thank
[1:53:35] God for a prophet that told us these
[1:53:37] things imagine if I can tell you by
[1:53:42] absolute vindication that the rapture is
[1:53:46] tomorrow morning 10 o'clock all right so
[1:53:50] if a school if you will go to work
[1:53:53] tomorrow right what do you mean work I'm
[1:53:58] gonna go out I'm gonna draw my last
[1:53:59] money we're gonna go for a big meal I'm
[1:54:03] gonna spend everything I have because I
[1:54:06] you know I don't need it anymore but the
[1:54:09] Prophet says if you know the rapture is
[1:54:10] ten o'clock nine o'clock you'll report
[1:54:12] for duty because that is our duty to
[1:54:16] carry on until the Lord comes and takes
[1:54:18] us doesn't matter when it doesn't matter
[1:54:21] how we are planting your potatoes we are
[1:54:24] here as an example we let our light
[1:54:25] shine amen so we have to find that fine
[1:54:29] balance what's the next verse there was
[1:54:31] a 12
[1:54:32] Joshua 14 we just read let's go to 12 he
[1:54:36] says now therefore now listen to this it
[1:54:39] is I'm ready I'm stronger now I haven't
[1:54:42] lost my faith I'm ready now he says now
[1:54:45] therefore give me what mountain was that
[1:54:49] when he went over and he spied the land
[1:54:54] he looked for the spot when the Giants
[1:54:57] was too
[1:54:59] that's why he knew I was born to be a
[1:55:02] giant killer no one of the others can
[1:55:05] take that portion because they're gonna
[1:55:07] fail but I know why God has called me to
[1:55:09] be a giant slayer and therefore he says
[1:55:12] give me first Mountain he was specific
[1:55:15] he was clear don't give me the portion
[1:55:17] next to the river don't give me the easy
[1:55:20] life
[1:55:21] give me the purpose why I'm here
[1:55:24] so don't pray for an easy life say lord
[1:55:28] give me the giant that I must slay give
[1:55:30] me the problems that I can handle to
[1:55:32] show that there's a god that is alive to
[1:55:35] show there is a victory to be had give
[1:55:38] me this mountain where of the Lord speak
[1:55:41] in that day for thou hurt us in that day
[1:55:43] how the Anakin's were there and that the
[1:55:47] city were great and frenched if so be
[1:55:50] the Lord will be with me then I shall be
[1:55:52] also to drive the able to drive them out
[1:55:54] as the Lord said so he's going for the
[1:55:57] most difficult spot if God can losing
[1:56:01] say my what do you want a little bit
[1:56:06] easier medium or hot amen most of us
[1:56:13] will most probably say easy easy one
[1:56:14] Lord you know I had I've walked 40 years
[1:56:17] already in the message so I think the
[1:56:19] last few years give me just the retire
[1:56:22] me Lord but not you Caleb not the bride
[1:56:27] the Lord I cannot do anything else I am
[1:56:30] a giant killer I am here to take down
[1:56:33] French cities I am here to take down
[1:56:36] straw walls I am here to be victorious
[1:56:39] another matter how old are all I mean
[1:56:42] the message I am poor I can't do
[1:56:44] anything else
[1:56:45] amen that's who we are
[1:56:48] so College is doing what you are afraid
[1:56:51] to do amen courage is
[1:56:56] because where there's no of that fear
[1:56:59] there's no college now remember there's
[1:57:02] two kinds of fears there's a godly fear
[1:57:04] and there's an ungodly fear the godly
[1:57:07] fear pushes you closer to God it gives
[1:57:10] you respect to the word it gives you
[1:57:11] respect to God gives you respect to
[1:57:13] believers it gives you respect to the
[1:57:14] offices it helps you because you
[1:57:17] understand your position now imagine the
[1:57:20] woman she has got a great need she comes
[1:57:25] to the Lord and the Lord is busy in a
[1:57:27] very important meeting with his
[1:57:29] disciples and they are talking and he
[1:57:31] comes and she comes from the side and
[1:57:33] she says master I haven't eat my
[1:57:35] daughter is sick to death now the first
[1:57:38] thing he does he ignores her now none of
[1:57:42] us like to be ignored we are human we
[1:57:45] like to be acknowledged we like to be
[1:57:48] talk nicely too because we are human
[1:57:51] there's no human that I've met that
[1:57:53] likes when somebody did accuse him
[1:57:55] scolds him calls him names we would like
[1:57:58] to be respected honored treated with
[1:58:01] dignity because we are made that way
[1:58:03] that's the way we should be
[1:58:05] now we geek no sir no that's the first
[1:58:09] remember when you when when God God
[1:58:10] loves to test your testimony test your
[1:58:13] faith test if you say I'm a believer it
[1:58:16] must be tested if you say I want victory
[1:58:19] it will be tested anything that you do
[1:58:22] will be tested so if you raise your hand
[1:58:24] ursa I need her like we sang this
[1:58:26] morning oh god take me closer to thee
[1:58:28] when you raise your hand you're putting
[1:58:30] a Lord Saint tests and trials that's in
[1:58:34] fact in plain language what you saying
[1:58:36] so don't cry Monday morning when the
[1:58:38] first test comes you must know I've
[1:58:40] applied for it yesterday Lord now give
[1:58:42] me the ability to pass this test because
[1:58:46] if you fail a test God is not like we do
[1:58:49] but where I come from you can't pass you
[1:58:51] can't fail any more is that right
[1:58:54] brother Paul don't want to tell too much
[1:58:57] where we come from but in school they
[1:59:03] there's a principle that when you fail
[1:59:06] they can tell you you failed anymore
[1:59:08] they just say you're not competent yet
[1:59:11] but they move you to the next level so
[1:59:12] you move of this not competent yet all
[1:59:15] the way through maybe I don't know how
[1:59:16] far they will take it but God is not
[1:59:19] like that if you fail
[1:59:22] God says just do it over you're gonna
[1:59:26] make it one day because God has got
[1:59:29] patience he's got time so he his purpose
[1:59:32] is for you to become an overcomer he's
[1:59:34] purposely used to be strong a solid son
[1:59:38] and daughter of God now this woman
[1:59:40] standing there's now the first the dist
[1:59:42] sir and he ignores her flatly and she
[1:59:45] continues and she continues until the
[1:59:47] point whether the disciples his Lord
[1:59:48] said that away she's disturbing the
[1:59:50] meeting so now there's a dialogue about
[1:59:54] this woman now Jesus goes to the next
[1:59:57] level because the first one she she
[2:00:00] passed the first test which was he's
[2:00:02] ignoring her many of us will fail that
[2:00:04] one miserably somebody ignores you you
[2:00:07] upset somebody does this you know yeah
[2:00:10] we are upset that we don't like but
[2:00:11] Jesus stayed she knew why she came she
[2:00:15] had a need and she knew where the need
[2:00:17] was and she came and she made a decision
[2:00:18] by faith that I'm not gonna leave until
[2:00:21] I get what I came for
[2:00:22] now God Tesla Eve no sir no the next
[2:00:25] thing the disciple says man she's making
[2:00:27] a big noise saying they're away because
[2:00:30] the disciple ready saw that the Lord is
[2:00:32] not going to do anything for her so now
[2:00:35] he's going to deny he's helping the Lord
[2:00:36] now to to get rid of her saying that her
[2:00:39] way Lord she's making a noise here I can
[2:00:41] tell you then he says yeah sure I'm
[2:00:43] actually not even for race she's a dog
[2:00:48] now that would check it all of us you'll
[2:00:53] take your Bible your message book and
[2:00:55] say I'm finished
[2:00:56] you won't see me again but she had a
[2:01:00] different attitude
[2:01:01] she had an understanding whatever he
[2:01:04] says I'm saying amen
[2:01:05] and she says Amen Lord but the talks can
[2:01:09] look from the counts when she says that
[2:01:12] she pulls his attention he turns her he
[2:01:14] says my greatest I faith woman go home
[2:01:17] that totally as well
[2:01:19] without prayer without anything cheap
[2:01:22] poot healing right from Haven Heights
[2:01:25] threw him right to our house without
[2:01:27] anything he says go home you're totally
[2:01:30] as well your attitude will produce
[2:01:33] results your attitude towards the word
[2:01:35] will produce mighty mighty miracles your
[2:01:38] attitude towards cards will produce
[2:01:41] things which you have never seen before
[2:01:44] so that's why God always disses us yeah
[2:01:48] don't think is his you know we as humans
[2:01:51] once it's easy we wants it so you know
[2:01:54] if God can just come down and give me
[2:01:55] the full program and tell me what's
[2:01:58] gonna happen the week and Monday and
[2:01:59] Tuesday until the day of the rapture
[2:02:00] then I'll be so happy but God will never
[2:02:03] do it because along this road he's gonna
[2:02:05] test you he's gonna try you he's gonna
[2:02:08] come like Elijah and Elijah when he came
[2:02:10] and he called him and Elijah was trying
[2:02:13] to make excuses the Prophet never begged
[2:02:15] him God will never beg you God gives you
[2:02:20] your own decision you are a free moral
[2:02:23] agent you are a free moral agent but
[2:02:27] remember God doesn't make all your
[2:02:29] decisions for you he allows you to make
[2:02:32] decisions it's a gift of God because he
[2:02:35] will commonly present the gospel to you
[2:02:36] say come give your life to me
[2:02:38] he will call you he will call you he
[2:02:41] will call you because remember you have
[2:02:43] power of decision until you make the
[2:02:46] decision once you make the decision the
[2:02:50] power is taken away let's say God calls
[2:02:54] you and he's saying come to me give your
[2:02:56] life to me in your leisure and you give
[2:02:58] your life to Him he takes you and it
[2:03:01] takes that they see the power of the
[2:03:03] decision away and now you become a
[2:03:04] prisoner you can never escape again he
[2:03:07] froze the key away in you a yeast
[2:03:09] forever that's what God does but the
[2:03:12] same principle comes to a negative site
[2:03:15] if you are a young man or woman stands
[2:03:18] then somebody presents you that first
[2:03:20] drink or that first smoke you have got
[2:03:24] power of decision until you take that
[2:03:27] drink until you take that drug once you
[2:03:31] do that the power is taken away
[2:03:33] you become a slave of that very demon
[2:03:36] that's why it's so important to play and
[2:03:38] to say Lord before I make a decision let
[2:03:41] me make the right decision because I've
[2:03:43] got power until I say yes or no
[2:03:45] therefore you have to understand it's a
[2:03:48] great opportunity and responsibility
[2:03:51] decisions that God gives us to make but
[2:03:55] this woman was what's dedicated she knew
[2:04:00] that I'm not going to go until he helps
[2:04:01] me because Timothy says for God did not
[2:04:04] give us a spirit of Timothy but a spirit
[2:04:07] of power and of love and of self
[2:04:09] discipline and perfect love drives out
[2:04:12] fear
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:15] another thing that we must help us
[2:04:17] remember your position if you don't know
[2:04:21] who you are you'll be in trouble but you
[2:04:24] must know your position in Christ you
[2:04:27] have to understand he has made me strong
[2:04:29] he has redeemed me he has washed me of
[2:04:33] his blood he has given me a save me as
[2:04:36] he has completely forgiven me he has
[2:04:39] helped me we have to confront our fears
[2:04:42] amen we have to understand remember what
[2:04:45] the Prophet says he had a dream about a
[2:04:47] man being like his father and a woman
[2:04:49] being like his mother and she was there
[2:04:52] and this man was an evil man
[2:04:54] and this woman when she rises up he's
[2:04:57] got a a a big club in his hand with
[2:04:59] three knocks on it and when she tries to
[2:05:01] rise up he beats her down and he was
[2:05:05] scared of the man it was a big man he
[2:05:07] was he's a small guy he was big small
[2:05:09] and now he beats and beats and he he
[2:05:12] doesn't know what to do and he says at
[2:05:14] one point he just walked up to the man
[2:05:16] now you can see again he has to face he
[2:05:21] has to face the problem he stood in the
[2:05:23] corner for a long time
[2:05:24] scared nothing happened God will not do
[2:05:28] anything until you move you have to move
[2:05:31] and place yourself positionally
[2:05:33] understand who you are where you come
[2:05:35] from where you going and as he comes to
[2:05:37] the man and he takes him by the collar
[2:05:39] this when I took him I looked and all of
[2:05:45] a sudden my muscles which was so small
[2:05:47] became strong it grew fight he call it
[2:05:50] faith muscles I become so strong he says
[2:05:53] that that man looked at me and he became
[2:05:54] scared of me and I told him if you hit
[2:05:57] her again you're gonna deal with me and
[2:05:59] he took control of the situation he says
[2:06:02] that's what God wants of us to be
[2:06:03] courageous taking control of the
[2:06:06] situation to say Satan is not gonna
[2:06:08] control my life I am a creator by Jesus
[2:06:12] Christ grace and therefore I can control
[2:06:14] I can do things that I that I'm not even
[2:06:17] aware of so you will never win until you
[2:06:21] rise up and face your responsibilities
[2:06:24] because there's no value in worry
[2:06:27] you can worry the whole day it's not
[2:06:30] gonna change anything and we all worry
[2:06:33] we worry over this we worry with that we
[2:06:36] are cut there's no value in worry but
[2:06:39] faith can unlock the door
[2:06:40] faith can bring the promised faith can
[2:06:43] do things that we have a need of because
[2:06:45] God has given sound mind and it's not
[2:06:49] your mind it's the mind of Christ to
[2:06:51] understand these things you have to have
[2:06:53] the mind of Christ because your own mind
[2:06:54] will say man that can never work but
[2:06:58] Christ's mind says you are more than
[2:06:59] able from Christ Jesus our Lord guy's
[2:07:01] mind says you can do it because you're
[2:07:04] more than able another thing you must
[2:07:07] remember you must censor your inputs
[2:07:10] amen what that means is don't listen to
[2:07:15] people that are negative because they
[2:07:20] will have a terrible effect upon you
[2:07:22] because they are feeding your fears you
[2:07:27] have to listen to what God says surround
[2:07:29] yourself with people of faith that can
[2:07:32] talk the faith language if you surround
[2:07:34] yourself of people that talk fear and
[2:07:36] those things they will feed that fear
[2:07:37] before long you will be fearful you will
[2:07:40] be scared you will not be able to do
[2:07:41] anything amen
[2:07:44] you have to surround because remember
[2:07:45] when Joshua came up and the ten spies
[2:07:47] went over they went over and as they
[2:07:49] came back they brought evidence of a
[2:07:51] good land they were excited they were
[2:07:53] happy Caleb and Joshua was ready to move
[2:07:56] over into the land but the ten spies
[2:07:59] says we can't do it and the Bible says
[2:08:04] they said listen let me tell you what I
[2:08:06] saw there I was walking and I saw a man
[2:08:09] I look like a grasshopper next to him
[2:08:12] and when the nation's start to hear that
[2:08:16] what happened they fear God feeding and
[2:08:19] the Bible says they all became scared
[2:08:22] and they all said we're not gonna do it
[2:08:24] Joshua and Caleb says we can do it
[2:08:27] here's the proof we can do it but the
[2:08:30] tenth of their report faded the fear of
[2:08:32] the people and of all people pulled back
[2:08:34] and say we're not gonna do it
[2:08:36] so fear that feeding of the fears a
[2:08:40] dangerous thing
[2:08:41] you have to surround yourself with
[2:08:42] people that feed your faith be an
[2:08:45] encouragement be an encouragement to one
[2:08:48] another
[2:08:49] amen be an encouragement to be able to
[2:08:51] stand and to be able to know so why
[2:08:55] don't we fear the devil amen
[2:08:59] because he's a liar you can't fear a
[2:09:02] liar because he's a deceiver if he tells
[2:09:07] you you not gonna make it you must know
[2:09:08] it's a lie so the opposite must be true
[2:09:10] if he tells me this then I must take the
[2:09:13] opposite then I know I'm gonna make it
[2:09:15] because he can never tell the truth and
[2:09:18] because God is with us we can never fear
[2:09:21] the devil because God is the creator of
[2:09:24] the devil the devil never created
[2:09:26] himself God created him and that Creator
[2:09:29] is my god so he says you have to be
[2:09:33] strong and courageous be strong and
[2:09:36] courageous do not fear or be in dread of
[2:09:39] them for it is the Lord your God who
[2:09:41] goes with you you will not leave you nor
[2:09:42] forsake you so the battle is not yours
[2:09:45] but it's God and the footsteps of the
[2:09:48] righteous are foreordained my is the
[2:09:52] time up can I get five more minutes I'm
[2:09:56] almost halfway but I'll finish now then
[2:09:59] he says be be courageous and then he
[2:10:01] says be valiant a man be valiant valiant
[2:10:08] in the Old Testament is for the most
[2:10:09] part the translation of power or might
[2:10:12] it is applied to the courageous and to
[2:10:16] men of war so with this courageous
[2:10:19] courage that you must have you must be
[2:10:21] valiant which means it gives you power
[2:10:25] courageousness comes and then the
[2:10:27] valiant nurse brings the power now if
[2:10:29] you think of Amanda let's let's take an
[2:10:31] example shammgod he's now yeah he's a
[2:10:34] faithful believer he's working hard in
[2:10:37] his garden and frying food supply for
[2:10:39] his family and he plants and he does but
[2:10:42] there's a problem because every year
[2:10:43] when harvest time is ready here comes
[2:10:46] the enemy drums beating boom boom boom
[2:10:51] boom 600 soldiers
[2:10:53] come over the hill and when he hears the
[2:10:56] drums he said Oh ik said to his wife oh
[2:10:58] my they're here again I hope I wish they
[2:11:00] never came this year and they come up to
[2:11:04] him there and the greeting morning
[2:11:06] Shamgar the office is looking nice this
[2:11:09] year thank you man you are a good worker
[2:11:12] and they take the soldiers they collect
[2:11:15] everything and there they go
[2:11:16] Tom Garland's family going through the
[2:11:18] house they cry say Lord how is it why
[2:11:22] how can you allow this Lord we work our
[2:11:25] heart we are faithful we are true and
[2:11:27] there they come and they pray Lord
[2:11:29] please next year Lord keep him away and
[2:11:31] the next year Havas is ready and he
[2:11:35] starts to hear the faithful drums doo
[2:11:37] doo doo doo comes the same enemy and so
[2:11:42] it repeats and they even more impresses
[2:11:45] and might this year's a record like old
[2:11:48] men it's wonderful yo
[2:11:50] you're a good man chamku and they
[2:11:52] collect an egg on sham bark rice and the
[2:11:56] next year they come up with a heel again
[2:11:58] but now there's a difference it's not
[2:12:00] the same soldiers same field same house
[2:12:03] the same man everything is the same but
[2:12:06] there's one thing that has changed he
[2:12:09] has now become a man of Valor he has now
[2:12:12] taken a decision last night that the
[2:12:14] player at the table he told his wife
[2:12:16] Mircea is a different year this year's
[2:12:18] the year of Jubilee this year is my year
[2:12:22] same man same good his same rain same
[2:12:25] Sun same everything and he comes and as
[2:12:29] they come down they come too and he
[2:12:32] comes and he stands in the middle of the
[2:12:34] road they get him good morning and he
[2:12:37] was maybe polite good morning my the
[2:12:40] harvest is nice
[2:12:42] thank you just step aside we're here to
[2:12:45] collect and he had now a different
[2:12:49] attitude he said man if you want this is
[2:12:54] that's behind me you have to come
[2:12:55] through me
[2:12:56] what do you mean you are one man we are
[2:12:58] 600 don't moisture don't waste your time
[2:13:04] and he says no I've drawn the line I've
[2:13:09] made a decision
[2:13:10] I have taken my decision and I am
[2:13:13] standing by what I want and what happens
[2:13:18] they said to the first line take him
[2:13:21] and remember only either stick with him
[2:13:23] a wooden stick that you prop the the
[2:13:26] kettle with and the the the Spirit of
[2:13:29] God came on him not before after he took
[2:13:34] the stand after he made the testimony
[2:13:36] after he said no more this is the end of
[2:13:39] it then the Spirit of God came on him
[2:13:42] God comes on the last minute he won't
[2:13:46] that's if he had that spirit last night
[2:13:48] and so it would have been but it wasn't
[2:13:50] an easy decision he had to make the
[2:13:52] decision from himself he had to trust
[2:13:55] God by faith from himself because that's
[2:13:57] real faith and when they came in the
[2:14:00] Spirit of God came in that stick and it
[2:14:02] started to move and the Bible says he
[2:14:04] killed all 600 that was the end of his
[2:14:08] problem the end of the enemy because he
[2:14:10] made a decision amen same conditions
[2:14:14] everything the only thing that changed
[2:14:16] was his decision his attitude towards
[2:14:20] the problem became a different attitude
[2:14:21] and it resulted in a different result
[2:14:24] before it they came in their problem but
[2:14:28] when he said this is mine you must know
[2:14:31] what is yours your family is yours the
[2:14:33] promises is yours no enemy can take it
[2:14:36] from you you are God's people but we
[2:14:40] have to accept it and act upon it in
[2:14:43] closing when Jesus preached one day a
[2:14:48] mighty sermon and he was in the boat got
[2:14:54] into the boat he said take me over to
[2:14:56] the other side and he went and he slept
[2:14:58] in the back of the boat and that mighty
[2:15:01] testimony service and how he did
[2:15:04] miracles and talking about it and the
[2:15:06] devil came and he started to bring a
[2:15:09] tempest and the winds start to blow and
[2:15:11] the waves start to gather momentum and
[2:15:13] it became a massive storm and they were
[2:15:15] fighting it
[2:15:16] because they were fishermen they knew
[2:15:18] the sea and they were draining the boat
[2:15:20] and they they they they they had first
[2:15:22] thought they gonna they gonna win this
[2:15:24] one but as time went this the the storm
[2:15:28] became a supernatural storm and they
[2:15:31] realized we're gonna die today and they
[2:15:34] kept looking at Jesus and they couldn't
[2:15:36] understand how can he sleep we are dying
[2:15:39] in his sleeping we are perishing and
[2:15:43] he's not he's not there for me how many
[2:15:45] times we go through things and we feel
[2:15:46] like God has forgotten me goddess he's
[2:15:50] not interested in me he has not thought
[2:15:53] about my needs
[2:15:54] and at that point they couldn't keep any
[2:15:57] more they wake him they shook him and
[2:15:59] they said master what was their first
[2:16:02] words don't you care
[2:16:04] that's what the devil will tell us God
[2:16:07] don't care let me tell you God kids
[2:16:10] God cares because He loves you he knows
[2:16:13] about you he knows your situation and he
[2:16:16] woke up he was in a deep sleep now my
[2:16:21] question to you is he was not in a
[2:16:24] different storm he was not in another
[2:16:27] realm he was in the same storm in the
[2:16:30] same boat that they will how could he
[2:16:33] sleep and they were fighting for their
[2:16:35] lives because he knew who he was he knew
[2:16:39] he was the son of God this son of God he
[2:16:42] knew that nothing can take his life
[2:16:44] before the time he knew all these things
[2:16:46] he was certain to him the prophecies he
[2:16:49] knew what the word says about him was
[2:16:52] true he says what gave Jesus faith was
[2:16:55] what the Bible says about him he
[2:16:58] believed it maybe many times think that
[2:17:00] you know he had something different he
[2:17:02] had faith in the word that's it that's
[2:17:04] why he never used any other power but
[2:17:06] the word he never used anything else but
[2:17:09] the word and when he woke up he said in
[2:17:11] the world you have little faith rebuking
[2:17:15] them and he spoke to the storm and the
[2:17:18] waves and everything just came down now
[2:17:21] if they would have just looked at him
[2:17:23] and realized but he's he's calm he's
[2:17:27] relaxed they could also relax
[2:17:30] they could just sit back and fold their
[2:17:32] arms and say let's see if this ship ship
[2:17:35] is gonna see because if this ship goes
[2:17:38] down he goes down and he can never go
[2:17:40] down therefore they could have just
[2:17:41] relaxed and looked upon him steadfast as
[2:17:44] long as I see him
[2:17:45] I am confident as long as I see the word
[2:17:48] I am at peace and that should be our
[2:17:51] attitude as long as you see the word
[2:17:53] moving in your life be at peace as long
[2:17:57] as the word is leading you be at peace
[2:17:59] because the word can never fail you know
[2:18:03] who you are accepted act upon it aim a
[2:18:07] let's bow heads
[2:18:17] if you want to raise your hand to heaven
