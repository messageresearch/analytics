about your goodness Lord not of our works not of our Deeds not even our own ability father but only of your goodness father Lord you are so mindful of us Lord that you came down to this earth father and you saved the rich like me Lord as we come together there's expectations and the expectation is to meet with you not to hear eloquent words of man Lord or some thought or some something that we speak Lord or try to figure out Lord but to hear the Living God step forth and speak to our hearts Lord we come for not just correction but for leading fathers Lord we come for strengthening Lord we come for Lord just a guidance Lord to restore our joy of our Salvation father Lord just to help us in a time where there's such a pleasure cooking time we preachers so much Upon Us Lord that Lord we sometimes don't know where to look father but we ask today that you would come down now in this service Father Make You Take Control Lord of this service made leave human control Lord may you the Divine author of this word step forth out of this book lord Jesus and speak to each one of us in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that's the bride's desire to hear the king Lord we just say this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we pray amen and amen amen welcome to church amen it is Sunday uh just uh just a couple of announcements before we really jump into the service we had brother jono's birthday just a couple of days ago and then we had brother Bean's birthday yesterday and today is brother Malcolm's birthday so a lot of good people's birthday on this little short time of space so you know we are very fortunate to have a pastor like we have and to have people like jono in our in our service you know in our church young people that's just just loves the Lord you know it stands for for the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ and then our pastor gets to go and bless brother Malcolm at East church and preachers at East Church which just loves the Lord just as much as we do so you know it's a it's a body work it's not it's an individual walk but it's a body work and if we always can keep our eye on each one next to us and just make sure we got each other you know and just keep each other nice and tight and before the Lord everything will be all right because the Lord will lead us but the body will follow amen it's like if you look at a head Jesus Christ is the head we're just a body and the head says to the body what to do we just say Lord please use me and if he doesn't use you it's all right he will still use you amen so don't worry if you haven't run in a while you won't pull a hamstring okay our Lord is very fit he'll make it happen up I will know it's not nice when you pull a muscle but when the Lord says go he knows he's anointing you for that time amen I'm sorry taking love and the musicians you can be seated now thank you amen just a quick announcement sister Tabitha has made these little books and she asked that we would just pray for them this is for the Sunday School 12 and under there's little booklets and I love it when the body of Christ do cool things like this you know so I think I might take a book myself so these like little Heroes of the Bible and little stories and and and just things that would keep the kids if they if they can't really stay in service and they all Rowdy and want to run around give them one of these little books but we're going to first pray over them she asked that we would pray over them so let's just bow our heads and we pray with these little books how gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know Lord that when we come and pray over these little books father it's because we we want your blessing over them Lord and Lord whoever touches these little books Lord may they touch you as well father may you touch them Lord Lord we know these maybe little things and exercises in these books Lord but there's life Lord because there is always where you are these life Lord Jesus so as they do these little exercises and and Lord they might not be able to concentrate like the the parents Lord and stay awake for so long Lord but we pray that these little books will keep them just in your presence father while they do these exercises and may there be many more of these Lord May there be many more we we as a body Lord just just honor you and praise you with our love gifts Lord so we ask your blessing over those books in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so for the little ones I'm not going to hand them out right now we'll do it the next service you you won't fall asleep in this one I maybe have a lot of pictures for you brother Isaac loves doing pictures thank you it's so quiet now I'm nervous now I promise the Lord I will not stay on my notes because I feel that when I stay on my loads I'm doing the work so I got a heaps of notes I got actually a lot of slides and I'll only pull them out when the kids fall asleep so please kids don't fall asleep because I really don't want to preach the notes I want to let the Lord lead okay because we're here to meet the Lord Jesus not a man okay but we want to go to II Peter and the first verse we're going to just jump in there now my my thought for today and the one thing I really God bless brother Ben on his his birthday see Sister Christine your year holding the fort um while brother Bean is up there I was a surprise to see you in service where are you that you you God bless you Sister Christine may you have a wonderful year with your husband and may you just live closer together in this year than ever before amen and and we know that our pastor loves you very much and he's always he always he always gives you a blessing when he's in the front so I think you know what I know you're going to blush but it's good yori's help mate and it's good that you are his help mate he needs to help mate amen I've just been preparing for this this service and I'll tell you a little bit about it I didn't sleep nothing last night I'm so nervous you can't tell me I'm shaking right here as I'm standing because when we approach the bride of Christ you're not talking to any people you're talking to the bride and and it makes you a very special people because it doesn't put you out of out of anybody else it just puts you on a special class because there's only one Mrs Chantels in this place and that's my wife and I chosen I wanted to marry her so when when we talk we talk a different language we read between lines we we have a different relationship a husband and a wife then then me and another sister would have a church with me and a brother would have or me and my own brother would have there's something special you're one so when God talks to his bride the one that he loves the apple of his eye you need to read between the lines so so I'm just asking today as you come to the service read between the lines talk to the Lord take man out of the way make it a personal discussion between you and the law today and I promise you you will leave you blessed so we'll start there at verse 3. he says there according as his divine power so this is the the faithful in the knowledge of Christ according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us into glory and virtue as I remember the Lord's doing the work here whereby we are given unto us a great and precious promises that these might yebo that by these you might be partakers of his divine nature amen now I want to say his divine nature so that means God has a nature that is out there that is that is Holy and pure and we are partakers of that amen and he gives us that ability not us having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen now I would stop there and start preaching on that but we'll get back to that and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance and to your Temperance patience and to your patience godliness and to your godliness brotherly kindness into your brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and abound that will make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and we'll just leave the Lord bless the reading of his word Lisa's bow our heads One More Time Lord Jesus as we're gonna open this word and we started reading we just need you to step forth now Lord and we ask that you will just take the rest of the service for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen now my thought and and maybe we can just put this one sort of this is my thought for today the noble King so what we read here in in First Peter and when we look there and it's very small so don't worry about it I'm just going to use this as my opening slide it says the way by giving to you as exceeding great and precious promises that by these you may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption of this world through lust amen so we know there was two trees in the Garden of Eden one was the Garden of the tree of life and then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we know these two trees are there now I kind of pictured the second tree if you can see it sitting in an iPhone because the iPhone represents the Apple That Was Bitten as well I find it kind of funny because and and and and not as a coincidence because when we look at the tree of knowledge there is good and evil in there but it's which one we look to most of the time so we all know that when we look at at your state where you are currently now I want to talk about the life of David I love King David I think he was a righteous King and I thought he was a real full real-life Christian so if I could put myself in someone's shoes I can put myself in the key issues of David because not not I'm anointed king or something special but he had a heart of repentance he knew when to go Lord yeah I've done it wrong so I know I'm getting a bit of heat of myself but you know what I'm not going to stick to these notes I want you to get right is God doesn't want you to be perfect you can never ever ever be perfect you cannot out of your own ability add anything to this book to to Merit your salvation that's right so as long as you know that there's nothing you can do that can Merit your salvation there's nothing you can bring to the table that can bargain with God to get you into heaven it don't work that way it's called The Plan of Redemption and to redeem someone is to take them from a lost state but a state that we were from then they got lost and then placing them back into that state so you couldn't be lost to begin with you belonged to someone at the beginning and the Plan of Redemption is to say you belong to me but I'm gonna bring you back to that state so I'm going to redeem you to that state it's nothing you can do you're sitting right on the south and you just stand there and say Lord help me please okay we can walk every day we can fight the battle every day in our own ability we need to also walk in faith because remember Faith takes every Divine promise in the word and makes it as if it is out so so you have to have a Measure of Faith there must be something in you to say I believe this word there must be something to say Lord once more so so remember if we look at David's life David when something went wrong he didn't just fall on his knees and say that's it I'm dead okay he didn't just give up he said Lord once more yeah I miss that once more and we're allowed to do it now that doesn't condone sin at all don't get me wrong God hates sin he hates the appearance of sin he hates a liar he hates a backbiter he hates someone that's proud and arrogant he hates people that knows the word better than you and they can phrase it how many times over but they can't live their life because they don't want the life they want to speak the life and they want to judge people by their words but they cannot live this life amen so if that's not a picture of some of the churches today that can tell you everything you're doing wrong and even brothers and sisters in the chairs don't tell me what I'm doing wrong I know when I'm doing wrong you know if you have the Holy Spirit in you and you've stepped over the line you know you stepped over the line there's no other ways the moment you stepped over it you go Lord I've stepped over the line because that's still small voices within you the holy spirit in you is guiding you but you've stepped over the line now but what now so we spend time on these stupid devices amount of time on this devices and you know on your device I dare you to go download a app it's called the time tracker or or a something tracker on this app I did it once I was shocked I deleted it I'm sorry the truth will make you free okay in the Book of John I think it's John 8 it says that the truth will make you free John 8 31 go to John 8 31 please all of you in your Bible readers grab your swords John 8 31. amen the truth will make you free so it's going to link into Peter do you have it up there or should I just go to I'll go to my Bible as well John 8. here we go and it says here in verse 31 and this is see now this is Jesus speaking so our lord Jesus is busy speaking and he says here where am I he says then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word so I want you to repeat after me if you continue in my word so where are we supposed to be in his word this is the the King of Kings busy talking to Jews that believe on him and he says all you need to do stay in my word stay in my word um then you are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it doesn't set you free it's a process so the moment I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ either and automatically go holier than thou I made it I didn't I I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ but then my trials came oh yeah then my failings came then sin came because before that I didn't know what sin was because there was no righteousness there was no clean image to be held so I didn't know what sin is so you might be a young teenager you young people you can show me your faces don't have to hide you might be young and you might have no clue what sin is and you might be busy doing sin right now I'm telling you and you might not even know your instinct but see the Holy Ghost once you have it will lead you and guide you in all truth and then it will show you what sin is but if you don't know you're wrong how do you know you're wrong so if your dad never comes to you and say I'm going to use Joshua because I know in the basically go hey Josh yeah when you wash the car with a green Scarrow with a sharp side on it yeah it's not going to work but see Joss really wants to wash that car really clean and he saw his mom using the sports carer and I'm using it because it comes out of eyes and he's washing the car really clean and in his mind he's thinking he's doing a really good thing but his dad knows he's wrong it's a very carnal example but I want you to realize Josh out of the goodness of his heart thinks he's right and he's washing that car and his elbow is burning but the paint's going because he's scraping off the color code and his dad comes to and says bro stop it right there and he goes oh now Josh has two choices he can listen to his dad or he can carry on doing this are we listening to our dad so how do we know we're in sin if God doesn't touch that sin so we'll come back to the service now now I'm about to preach subject matter expert David who knows the story we all know this story eh oh yeah okay maybe we see see it different today David and Bathsheba and we'll go through the first slide there because I think it's it's good now I'll take my clicker because I need to go through the scriptures amen you all still with me now remember you don't know you were wrong until God showed you you were wrong just want to see if this one works yeah they said okay and we just read there and we're gonna go to second Samuel 11 1-5 you can grab your Bibles because that's very small I didn't think it was come out that small so I'm really sorry about that but don't worry about it we've got our Bibles and we're going to start the at verse 11 1-5 so I'll just put up one to five here anyways because I've got all the oh no I can't I've got some stuff in me okay amen praise the Lord are you still awake don't worry I'm awake too because I started falling asleep we got problems and David and Bathsheba and it came to past well there after a year was expired now remember now that that Amon the king of Amon he started he came against David now so he got all the the people around him big armies everything and he besieged Jerusalem he wanted to take the kingdom of David but God was standing for him but realized that when this battle was raging on the Forefront David seen joab and all his troops to go and and keep this battle in a race okay and set the battle and right but David stayed at the back so and he came to pass that after years was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent Joe up and his servants with him and all Israel that they destroy the children of Ammon and beseech Rebel but David Terry is still in Jerusalem now I'm just going to preach around those things because I want you to realize this is you you're David today so people go to church you come to church but you stay behind at home it's the same battle see see the natural types of spiritual the the Manna in this Bible is not for you just to read the story of David but find yourself within the pages of David we are here the enemy is here they will don't want you to have a blessing today you can fall asleep you could worry about basketball rugby game on this weekend springboks lost who cares in the economy of God who cares okay did we take one step forward oh we didn't get to try we were robbed who cares so tomorrow when everything is done everything is done does the wreck became matter no so stay here today because this is for you amen this subject I would tell you I was sitting on my knees the whole of afternoon yesterday doesn't make me anything special to say Lord I just don't want to preach anything that's me so I do believe today with the confirmation of this one who read this morning's family altar who read it this is this is this is what I'm talking about it's this morning's family altar because God comes and confirms that I am with you I was so nervous when I woke up this morning the first thing I said is Lord I'm thinking I might not be ready for this one and he's saying that family altar thank you sister Robin and it's exactly where we are today God has this this is for someone make it yours amen so David stayed behind church was going David he just started I'm not impressed because you know what youth everyone we want to be entertained I can sit till 12 o'clock at night and Google YouTube Snapchat and all those things but he wants to come to church I want to I want to go somewhere else how can you be blessed he says and it came to past that in the evening time David arose off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof we saw a woman washing herself man it's small sorry and the woman was very beautiful to look upon sin is beautiful inside sin is beautiful if sin wasn't beautiful none of us would do it so brother Brandon picks it up here and he says here and I need to read it from here he says there are three things I've noticed in the reading of history that Rick's a Minister's life from the start one of them is money and the love of it the second one is popularity because he thinks he's something when he's nothing anyhow and then the next thing is woman that's right a man makes money woman popularity that's been I'm going to read it if I can sorry that that's right a man makes money woman popularity that's been the three major things that God has troubled us we are trouble with these children many of many of the other things that goes along with the two so he's not say it's not just these three he says that's the main three things that starts Wars that begins things a lot of people say oh religion is the fourth thing religion is never the fourth thing it's always about a woman money and power popularity okay they use religion as an excuse but religion don't start it my God never say though it was in the Old Testament we have to fight we have to take the land since the Lord Jesus came in my life he never said fight with your brother he said even if you're angry with your brother you have committed murder because you kill this influence okay even if you're angry with someone and you're justifiably right and he's done you 100 wrong the moment you lose your temper you cut off Grace from him for yourself and you say he's out of the blood you can't do that we don't pitch folks and services we don't come and sit here and say this is for this one and this one's this one it's for us amen amen we're still following so he says then but the main thing is that God begins to bless a brother and give him something little more or something other to help him and his people and then the man begins to think greatest battle ever thought is way in the mind that's where Satan always comes he says then the man begins to think see who I am and right then he's on the road and I'll tell you you know how to get up is to get down the Way Up Is Down amen he that humbles himself God will exalt him is that right he that exalts him God will break make him a base so now David remember he's now King and David is now sitting in a position of authority and now the very next verse it says and David sent to inquire after the woman and one said is this not beshiba the daughter of Eli the wife of Uriah the hittai now he's got two choices you always have two choices you go right or wrong there's no two other ways boys I hope you're listening you either have yes or no you have write or go when you're in between those two choices that's when the battle is on Israel was fighting an enemy but David was fighting a far greater one because the law forbid him to do that he knew well what was the Commandment of the Lord he knew well what was wrong so when he started looking at this when he saw this and and the word came back to him they said to him don't do it because this man is this woman is married then this should have gone through his head yes and you cannot tell me when you in sin and you're looking at things and you see the image on a phone on a computer I don't care what you say you see that image something inside you don't tell you uh we shouldn't be yeah come on I was there every time I open my phone young men young women and I start looking at fashion and I start looking at what the world models do and I start distracting by the things that is pleasing to the eyes and lustful to the desire I'm not sure just talking pornography and those things I'm talking something that I really want that I would place above God I would place that time above God Superstars sport cars collection anything that would consume your mind so much that would take you away from this now I'm not saying we should stay in this all day wrong and just read our Bible it's not what I'm saying don't get me wrong we live we work but if it's taking all your time from this there's no balance so if you find yourself waking up in the morning and you haven't read your Bible for a week you haven't really prayed for a week you are not communing with our Lord Jesus Christ you're here he's saying that you're busy committing adultery and these laws now the law we're not under the law but we love our Lord Jesus Christ and if I start walking away from my wife and I will use her a bit of example today and I start getting busy with all other things how's my wife going to feel true so I not because I've got a ring on my finger I should stay true to her because I've got a ring on my finger I want to stay true to her me and dad was talking about it yesterday about choosing the Lord Jesus Christ as your husband you're not you're not just marry his arm you marry the whole book okay you eat it sweet in your mouth better in your belly because some of the things that he ask you ain't always nice sin needs to come to the service who has ever lied please I want to see Hands you save a life because maybe if nobody lie I want to ask you how do you do it I've lied okay who's ever had to confess a lie okay how fun is that how fun is it is it fun say dad you know I just wrecked your car like sorry yes you told me I couldn't do it and I couldn't take it but guess what I still did it and I wrecked your car and your dad looks you in your eyes I'm just using day because he's the closest and he goes what how do you feel at that moment but now I want to ask you and this is where I'm preaching a bit if you hold that sin and you put it in your pocket and it walks with you every day the sites you visit the places you go the lies you tell all the sin you just put in your pocket and you put it in and you put it in and you put it in and you put it in and you put it in and you put it in and you get a new home and you just a Grumble bee and everybody gets close to you just want to say yeah and people talk about you like this one there and sticky fingers and because now what happens is your your body is taking up a burden that is not yours sin should not be attributed to you you should get rid of it as soon as you can because all it does it weighs you down sister Romans saying that that message this morning it steals the joy of your salvation it cannot take your salvation but it steals your joy amen that's the conclusion I had but I thought I'll just say it in right now you start becoming miserable you're you're just grumpy and all that's in you wants just to to either hurt someone or walk away from people and you find yourself sitting in a little corner and having your own pity party and this one said this about me and that one say this and I'm never good enough for this and every time I get to the front they say no it's not your turn and then and you start back biting and you start gossiping and you start just murmuring and you start being like Israel when they were in the desert you murmur you become a c spool everything inside you is like a passing saw and I know it's really hard but I want you to say it's not good to have that sin you cannot stay with that sin it's not yours it's not yours so now we'll jump a little bit ahead and David said messages and took her and so he had a choice to make the right choice thou shall not kill that's coming they also not commit adultery he's going to do it and that's it that shall not cover the neighbors he knows this and he goes and do it anyway he wasn't in a bad state he was just lifted up I'm King I got 500 wives I can have one more so his his State wasn't under under leadership of the Holy Ghost he had a oops moment and oops moments happen it does don't don't worry about the oops moments it happens and it will happen very very because as long as the Lord is working with you and he's adding to your virtue Temperance until your Temperance is adding faith patience brotherly kindness you know as he's working with you as he's cleaning you out you will find some of the things that you do now is wrong and the Bible don't want you to do it and if you're a Bible reader you can find it in it I have nothing against this message because this message never came and gave me a Doctrine it just pointed me back in the word we got hotties it went back to the word and says you know what God doesn't really like this here's your example and I went oh all if God don't like it I don't like it amen and then he goes just remember when it wasn't the old though Jezebel and I can talk about Jezebel because everybody gets scared when we talk about these things but there's one woman that wore makeup in the Bible it was Jezebel yeah I'm sorry you you eat it you take it you talk to God about one woman okay and the dogs licked her blood because God hated her because she tore she tore a man of God away from God and she made him serve her Gods that's the only example I have of someone wearing makeup if you want to make weird makeup you talk to God if you don't want to wear it you talk to God I'm going to tell you what to do but I've written the word and the word says thus and I think you know what Lord even if it's an Old Testament I want the whole book amen okay so a woman cutting hair I know this is a very situation I know people that love the Lord very much that read this Bible and more devoted than a lot of us and that scripture hasn't been revealed to us and it's fine because as they walk with the Lord he's going to add he's going to add but don't stop because it grinds you don't stop because it's kicking against you don't stop whatever you do don't just shun the word take the whole word the all the new from give it to Kiva listen I cannot get you into the kingdom of God I cannot tell you what's the heart of God but I know that a Vindicated Prophet came down to this earth and he was standing in prayer lines now I've never seen such a thing in my life I've never heard any sermon in all of the denominations where a pastor stood on a pulp and said I'm waiting for him to come and then he says he's here now if you've listened to those tapes talk to me if you if you've listened to the discernment where God reveals to a person they name where they come from when they were sitting with the doctor what they have who are they praying for them and they say thus save the Lord you're healed there's more to that man just in the simple sermon that he's preaching I just want to tell you that people knock this message a lot I stand for every little bit of it and I will never ever in my life compromise with it because I'll tell you what I was David this story is me amen my wife's not here now you asked my wife I was David I was and the woman conceived and said to David that I'm with child now David's got a problem David made a mistake but now he's reaping what is sowing he's now reaping what he's sowing now listen to David Now navigate to a point where he could either because remember law now says he's a date man doesn't matter if you're King the law says that woman was married to Uriah that's right so by his law it's certain death so now he tries to cover it up but you see you reap what you sow Galatians 6 7-10 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth he shall also reapeth God's not mocked you know so Uriah comes to him he calls her eye off the battlefield and I'm just going to tell you the story and he sees to Ariah and will paraphrase a bit go read the account he says go sleep go go to your house go to your house go be with your wife just go there what does Uriah do who knows the story yeah he goes lies at the gate and he says how can I amen amen while the ark is out there can I go inside my house and wash my feet and Beam with my wife look if I was a writer I would have gone straight to my wife I love my wife I love my wife with everything in me because for me I just love my wife but see this man wasn't even a Jew he was a gentile he was a gentile and a gentile had so much love for David the king I want you to read between the life lines he had so much love for David the king our Lord Jesus Christ that he said I will not go to my wife and God ordained it because he wanted to expose sin and then again David says oh no I'm not getting anywhere here so he makes him drunk and he says now go to your wife what does Ariah do he does not go because inside of him there is something he is an honest loyal Christian you know brother Branham seek when he gets to Heaven he's going to go to Uriah and he's going to shake his hand I I've listened to and I want to maybe just say something here I've listened to amen I think over 800 sermons of brother Brenner not once did he make himself God not once did he give him glory to himself and every prayer line I've heard not once that one challenge come back and said it's not true when he said in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ thus save the Lord it came to pass every time see but and I feel I just feel I just feel like I just want to say this don't don't don't criticize me don't criticize this Mission I'm going to tell you something have you gone and listened he that every year let him hear it is the lady you see on Church age it's the last Church before I came into this message I didn't even know what a church age was I didn't even know what was sin I didn't even know that sin goes all back and I knew God I knew of God I knew that he's going to punish me for my sins and then he came died and died on the cross and he took all my sins away and that's good enough Grace Grace Grace I knew that but nobody could tell me where I'm standing in time nobody could say you're in an age which is increased with goods and need of nothing naked blind and miserable and they don't know it it wasn't a Doctrine it was a voice and as long as I have breathed in this ear you either stand for something if you fall for everything but you can only go this far and God will sit but I send you a witness I'll send you a message to tell you where you are I've given you a warning I don't know if you ever listened to the sermon flashing red light I've given you a warning to say time is no more and it wasn't to line us up with a Doctrine it was telled to say read your Bible pray every day connect to me because it's only one way you're going in a rapture's you have the Holy Ghost so if you if you think you have the Holy Ghost then you're good because the Holy Ghost will take you in the rapture but the Bible gives us strict instructions how to do everything but we choose to listen to the word of man and we forget about the word of God and the word of man makes the word the doctrines of man makes the word of God to no effect it is hard I know it's hard but guess what I'm not the pastor brother Bean will pick this up and he will put all the balance on because he's the pastor I just live a life but I've seen people heal I've seen my son heal I've seen my life change I've seen its life change that's all it's life change my Dad's life changed my mom she loves the Lord she's still walking her life will change because it says no hoof shall be left behind because before this message there was no power of the Holy Ghost before this message it was a lot of anointing I want you to read between the lines a lot of anointing a lot of things that happened signs and wonders that's not where we look we don't look it says we can adulterous Nation looks after signs of Wonders we look in the word because we're married to the word I want to know everything about you Lord everything that's right everything I want to know why when it is the Gentile dispensation is going over I'm so away with my servant but praise the lord we need to change of the G-Spot a gentile dispensation when the cup of iniquity is flowing over when it's at the end where are you because I ain't going through a tribulation are you not going through a tribulation I haven't aligned my life up I'm not saying I'm not fighting these battles I'm not saying I'm not failing I'm not saying that every day God brings me to my knees and picks me up again I'm not saying that I just say I know where I'm going and I know what I believe amen it is very strong but you know what sometimes we just need to say it as it is there is no other way out that's right amen we continue so Uriah gets killed and they come back to David and they say don't worry bro your sin is covered your plan worked how many times did we lie to our moms and dads how many times did we lie to our bosses how many times did we tell a Porky and we think we got away with it how many times how many times did God tell you to do something and you just flat ignored it because of Pride or because of of your own ability or your own way of thinking you know the Pharisees and the statistics are their way of thinking and Jesus told them time and again and time and again and they just were they were blinded but they they didn't want to hear it didn't sit well with him doesn't go with their lifestyle right you know I have to kick a bit more YouTube videos off and you know maybe have to uh you know align myself a little bit more up and spend time in this thing called the word listen to the message of the hour have you ever gone through the Revelation series have you gone through the church age book I I challenge you to go do that before you speak about the prophet because it says you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you will get a prophet's reward okay you you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man you'll get a righteous man's reward so there's a lot of people out there but there's only one prophet of this hour amen and he was Vindicated it wasn't just a bunch of sermons that's right okay now here we go one day Mr David docking Brother David sitting there on the throne and uh Nathan the prophet comes to him now I want to quickly tell you that by Your Word you will be judged because sister Belinda said it this morning it's the spoken word what comes out of this lips God is listening he also judge you on your own words you don't need to have a a prophet you've got one already but you need to have a prophet to tell you what is wrong God's going to judge you by your own words because the moment you speak that it will return to you because you reap what you sow and what you caused upon the water that breed you caused the deal to come back to you so if it's good bread or bad breed you're going to eat it one day you're going to receive it yeah so backbiting gossiping you know talking bad about brothers and sisters those type of things it will come back to you but I'll tell you why because God wants to expose that sin amen okay so I'm not I'm not I'm not dangling over hell don't get me wrong just hear me out God wants to expose sin that's right because he wants you sinless and blameless and he's going to help you because remember when we read second Peter he says I will add I will add I will add I will add to you and add to you so he will make you free don't worry about it but just remember when he's when he's busy talking to you not condemnation conviction there's a response so um Nathan the prophet comes out and he talks about this they were two men in one city and one was rich and the other one was very poor and he had a little ew lamb and he treated it like a daughter and he loved it so much and and then this rich man had a visitor from out of town and then he took this this ew of this little lamb of this guy and he just killed it and prepared it and gave it to the man to eat and David was angry because now Omar why would you do this but his own his own mouth says as the Lord liveth the man that have done this thing shall die surely die speaking judgment over himself not knowing what he's doing so telling you sometimes when you speak judgment and you and you speak what you know you speak be careful yeah because the way you measure you will be measured okay yeah so of course then and I'm just showing the pictures for the kids look there's pictures kids don't fall asleep that's Nathan and his pointing finger okay he's pointing finger and he says to David it's you you are that man and David has a moment where he his mind goes clear and he goes oh Lord what have I said what if I see it just now because he's the king so David is in a backslidden condition now I want to ask you something and it was with the ministers we had a bit of a chat about it but if you're backslidden does that cost you salvation no it puts you out of Fellowship but it doesn't cost you your salvation God gives you your salvation God died on the cross for all your sins he made the way that's the noble Kingdom coming to the good part don't don't fall asleep on me now I know it's hot we can maybe turn the temperature all way down if you want to brother keep being get them freezing okay there's this Noble King so David wasn't out of Fellowship wasn't wasn't out of salvation he just lost his joy and I'm going to bring it to you because that's what happened this morning there was a king such a noble King a great lover of his subjects I want you to read between the lines and one day before his God and His royalties said you know what today you'll see me for the last time in many years and he's God and His Noble said to him good King why do you say then are you going to go to some foreign country are you going to be alien there he says no I'm staying right here but I'm going amongst my subjects I'm going to become a peasant a great king is going to go lower than the lowest low we had a footwash junkie you know my foot was flunky he just he washed the feet of men that's right please read between the lines here this means a lot to me it's not it's not an emotional thing we had a great king it says I'm going to cut wood with a wood Chopper I'm going to till the ground with a toiler I'm going to work The Vineyards with the people that that prune The Vineyards I'm going to be one of them in order to get better acquainted with what they are doing because before that if you look at the life of Israel they were up and down and up and down and God came angry and and then and then angry and and then he forgave them and angry and he forgave them and and David by that account should have died God forgave him he was not under the blood of of Jesus Christ he was under the blood of bulls and goats he was under the law he was strictly on the law me and Dad told me this is actually we're really anchored he said if you're under the law you should have kept all the law Not Just the Ten Commandments I love it thanks Dad it was really a blessed me so much when you said it because I was here when you said that so if you really wanted to keep all the law you had to keep all of it but if you lost one bit of it yeah stiff there was no Grace Aiken took a Babylonian garment yeah and his whole family and his cattle and everything got destroyed because he was under the law but he is a great King David the heart of God that he loved so much yet this man finds Mercy is it fair it is because it's God's doing not yours and it's marvelous in our sight so he says and I'm going to be one of them because I love them and I want to be more acquainted to them personally is our Lord Jesus Christ personally acquainted to you this morning are you having such a relationship when some days you just sit in your bed and you start crying oh Lord where would I be if it wasn't for you hey when I was David I read the story and all I saw was our month and I'm thinking oh God I should have died in my sins one day I'll tell you my testimony I'm going to cut wood with a wood chipper I'm going to tour the ground it's just because I personally want to love them the next morning the delegates and all of the people saw him left take off his crown laid upon the throne take off his robe put on his peas and clothes and he was born in a manger and brother Branham says yeah they said to the king king we want you we love you because all that heaven knows who he is it's only us that's sitting here in time that forgets who he really is sure it's only us is sitting in this veil of mortality that actually know who he is but who all is in heaven knows the king of kings and for that time when they were silenced that silence was when he left the throne to come to us because he knew he had to come down and he had to come and get our monstrovi on this Earth and that was where God did it he changed himself from being Jehovah God and became one of us so that he might suffer then he might taste taste death that he might know what is this thing of Dave was and he take the penalty of death upon himself and he laid himself and down a crown and a robe and became one of us he washed out feet he washed feet with with the lowly he dwelt in things with the poor he slipped in the woods and in the streets and those who were on that was unprivileged he became one of us that he might understand us better and then he might understand him better yes so we can't go standy before God and say Lord you don't know he was tempted just like us okay it was everything that we went through he went through because he had to understand you Lord so David this is the heart of David this is what I want to ask you if if you're finding yourself on that side you're finding yourself lost distracted occupied is a way back you don't need to stay there and your battle is not going to get easier but the quicker you realize the way you stand yes the quicker load can bring you back up in because when he knows where you stands then you know where you stand and when you know you stand with God then God can say give it to me yes but give me your sin if you need to say sorry to a brother go say sorry if you need to say Lord I I cry out my eyes before you then you do that you do whatever you need to do to get right with God today because there ain't no time you don't need to be in a perfect State you need to be in a perfect state with him amen he knows you he knows you no matter what I tell you if you've committed adultery you talk to God committing adultery is not just man and wife it's man and wife if someone else is your your man your husband your your effort your love your fiction if there's anything else that see a fiction above him make it right today yes I'm not doing altar call I'm telling you make it right today because you don't want to hinder your walk with the Lord that's right and David said unto Nathan I've sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David and the Lord hath put away thy sin thou shall not die and it's only a prophet that can say that anyways because remember the law was the law but the prophet is where Grace comes through that's where where God comes and says don't worry I got you you don't need to die amen okay because now if there is a place for you that you can cross where you can come back but when it is that you're down there again in the same shape you was it goes to show that the only Fell From Grace backsliding is not lost I want someone to tell me where backsliding is lost proven in the Bible backsliding is not lost it's just out of Fellowship Israel backslid but they never lost the Covenant they lost their praise and their Joy so when you backslide there's a consequence there's a consequence if you lose your joy and you lose your praise to God you can't stand in church and lift your hands and say glory be to God you can't and every time people look at you your face looks worse for wear now I've been through a couple of Trials this last couple of weeks months okay and all that's learned is I get distracted and I lose my joy and it's all the devil can take from you he cannot take your salvation but he will take your joy he will take it because it's the only thing he can take is the joy and your praise and he wants you to praise him because all this garbage music out there and all this YouTube stuff and all this wishy-washy gospel because if you praise him in that you've given your praise to the wrong person because it said at the end time the two seats will be so very close and will deceive the very elective Force possible and Satan wanted to be as God be exalted okay so just remember Satan's desire is for your praise Satan's heart desire is to get you to praise him and not God because when he was kicked out of heaven what did he do he was the song leader so all he wants you to do is praise me get away from God so he wants to steal your praise and then when you start praising him and things go up and down because you don't stay in your word you're all just in music and all this lovely stuff and you don't you don't get some vitamins in you then you start losing your joy because you feel you keep failing you keep failing you can't overcome and it becomes harder because why you lost your joy because you're not in the word you're not in connection with the Lord Jesus Christ amen he says but Jesus says because I love you live or die oh no so brother Branham says then I come to this church in legalism this morning legally now I want you to say brother Branham is tired in this sermon okay and he says I feel tired I've been nervous upset wondering about something before me my heart is burning even as my heart is fluttering I got a cramp a pain right this minute it's shooting back and forth whoopsie I did that right he says it's shooting back and forth up and down through here weak nervous trembling I can't hold it here my trembling catch a hold here and squeeze I got my toes squeezed up in my shoes he's nervous he's in a place where he's just worn out are you worn out this man is worn out he's standing in front of how many people say I'm tired I'm nervous I'm a wreck he says but because I love God live or die I must stand here for him amen he says use of God because you love him not because you've got to do it because you love him and then I'll close with this the musicians come up because it's not a long service but I want to I want to close with this so brother Branham talks about his wife and he says I love my wife and even if I do something wrong and I go back to meet her and I say to her I'm very sorry she will forgive me no matter what I do because that love is a different type of love he says but because I love her I don't want to do it so I want you to tell you that you don't need to sin you don't need to sin to come back to the Lord so he reveals your son like David and he tells you I forgive you to come back to you don't need to go there you can overcome it all you have to do is your core thought When sin comes in is I love Jesus so when I walk and this is how my dad told it to me when you walk to a nightclub take Jesus with you because when you get to the door you go I love Jesus okay [Music] when that that that Ricky you know that that guy that slick with the nice hair and a cool thing I love you you're special to me you know like you're my future wife and he Woos you be careful because remember is just wooing you but Let Jesus Christ sisters lead Jesus Christ with you because if he was a true man he would have gone to your dad first and he would have walked to your dad and say you know what I like your daughter may I have a chance to get to know her better but see a Slicker comes in the back door he always wants to do it the easy way and he always comes with wooing words but it's a slicker because he was if he was real serious about you like I went to my father-in-law and was the hardest discussion I had in my life man I got dragged over the coals thanks Dad because he wanted to know if I loved his daughter but see my Approach wasn't his daughter my Approach was his dad or her dad because I knew if I got the the consent of the dad and the blessing of the dad then I can go ahead with the relationship but if the dad said no if Jesus Christ says that's not the one for you be careful yeah be careful you young men before you go to any young lady don't know why I'm saying this but I'm just gonna say it you'll be able to pray for your wife because even if y was the life of David it was one thing I did right I prayed for my wife I didn't even know God back then I knew of him but I didn't know God that's why I married my wife the second time because then I knew who's God and I knew what I made the promise to but the first time I didn't know but I did when I didn't know him go on my knees and I said a wonderful Lord Jesus I said these words I said and it kind of came back to me as well I said Lord I wanna I want a wife that can stand with me but she needs to be a bit stubborn as well I did I said look she needs to be stubborn because I'm a pushy man and I want things my way but I wanted to be my help mate I wanted to be my sounding board I wanted to when I'm when I'm wrong she tells me I'm wrong and I want a mother to my children I don't want to go that dates me for money or for my car or for my good looks oh what someone is serious about this so if David that day lucky the Lord had a plan plan with David and we know that the Plan of Redemption State still came through David and God had a plan for it but see God just David got ahead of himself don't get ahead of yourself wait on him your your first relationship is with God if it's with your mobile phone or Snapchats or messaging behind their backs and those type of things away with that stuff that's not how you get to know someone is through a message line or a date site doesn't work that way I'm against it as much as I can if you cannot talk to someone straight God talks to you straight you cannot talk to them face to face don't do these things behind their parents back stop that utter nonsense will not get you anywhere that's my service as you may do it wrong but the blood of Jesus Christ is coming then whenever you do this wrong I got you I just want you to come to me and say I was wrong I always tell my boys no matter what you do even if you ever kill someone never lie to me because even if you're 100 wrong I will fight for you I will fight for you with everything in me even if I know you're wrong I will take your place and go sit in jail if I have to I don't care but never lie to me because if you lied to me I can't help you send a stone attributed to you and sin will always come out so if you keep it Satan has something against you at the day of judgment you need to put it under the blood and the only way to put sin under the blood is to confess it and move on don't dwell on it it's not your sin Satan tricked you okay but put it down it's under the blood and when you put something under the blood it's done it is finished it is finished that's why I said when he died for all sin he said it is finished you do not day pick it out of the blood it is done if my son said he was wrong and the judge came in and said what did he do I said Lord take me it was me I'll do anything for my son it was me how is the carnal man as a normal human being can I come and say I can stand like that for my son and the blood of Jesus Christ can't take your sin away why did he die for us so while we at this moment I want you to realize if you're busy living in sin if you're doing things that not of the Lord now lay it down now don't take it with you it's not yours you were tricked the day of judgment he will go back on the head of the accuser amen and we will look upon that that devil Satan we will look upon him and what will we say Church is that the man and through the whole world into sin this man because when you gave all you sent to him he can't point one finger back to you [Music] so David forgot to do it right but you know what he repented and what happened Solomon came through him the Millennium Reign was a thousand years beautiful Millennium is coming give your sin to the Lord Jesus Christ go in your rapture while everybody else is here going through the tribulation and it's going to be a rough tribulation I tell you now and you can see the writings on the wall you don't you don't need to be a Christian to know that this was falling apart but if you've given everything to the Lord and there's nothing left and he knows who you are you're ready for a Rapture because he will make you ready and take you up amen amen may the Lord bless this um brother Isaac if you maybe I'll just close in the word of Prayer and uh I just want you all to Bow your head just for a moment Lord Jesus every one of this brother and sisters you know my heart I love with all my heart Lord Jesus and just as a man when I look at their faces father I just see you I see your Plan of Redemption I see your grace on their life Lord it makes me happy to see these people here today Lord because they came to church they already won they could have been anyway but they chose to spend their time here with you my Lord and I asked today that this mixed up words and everything I said Lord that you would don't put the anger in it don't don't put the the Zeal in it that I have you know I Am Lord Jesus and I ask that you would just just help me as well Lord but I want you to put your love within this message and my everyone today that listen to this message Lord may you talk to them and Lord may they come before you now and I pray as well with them Lord and say Lord here I am oh Lord just take that coal of fire touch my lips Lord here I am cleanse me from all sin because Lord none of us have it all together but Lord we love you and I pray those that is weak and that's feeble and that lost the joy of their salvation I ask that you would just give it back to them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father they that is down and out Lord or even them that's on the Mountaintop may they just grow closer to you now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen and amen amen [Applause] [Music] when I was starting the service this morning I was going to actually read Psalm 42. so I'll just read it now as the heart Panthers after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after the O God this is David my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they
