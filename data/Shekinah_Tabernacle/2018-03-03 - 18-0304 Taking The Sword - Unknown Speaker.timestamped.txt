[39:36] another speaking of Gideon and his and
[39:38] his son this is after they have defeated
[39:40] the Midianites and the children of the
[39:42] east then great victories have happened
[39:44] and now we come to this part of the part
[39:47] of the story so his so he says and he
[39:50] beat down this is Gideon and he beat
[39:53] down the tower of pinyon and slew the
[39:55] men of the city then said he unto a
[39:58] zipper and Zelda mana which so they have
[40:02] um what manner of men are though whom
[40:05] you slew at table so these men killed
[40:07] his family and they answered as thou art
[40:11] so are they each one resembled the child
[40:14] of a king and he said they were my
[40:17] brethren even the sons of my mother is a
[40:20] Lord liveth if he had saved him alive I
[40:22] would not slay you and he said unto
[40:25] death
[40:27] his firstborn up and slay them but the
[40:31] youth drew not a sword for he feared
[40:33] because he was yet a youth the in zipper

[43:01] perfect health father and Lord we just
[43:04] ask that you would further everyone
[43:05] who's not here this morning may you be
[43:07] their portion father be their strength
[43:09] Lord and may you Lord just quicken us by
[43:11] your spirit father this morning Lord we
[43:14] just want to commit ourselves into your
[43:15] hands Lord we Lord as your prophet told
[43:17] us the greatest gift that anyone can
[43:19] have is to get themselves out of the way
[43:21] Lord that you can manifest yourself
[43:23] through that person and Lord as a
[43:24] congregation of people help us to all
[43:26] get ourselves out of the way Lord that
[43:28] you could manifest yourself in this
[43:30] meeting Lord or not just this at this
[43:32] moment but every day of our lives may
[43:35] you grab to feel glory we thank you for
[43:37] your Lord the cross of Calvary your
[43:39] blood that was shed follow by one
[43:41] offering we have been lured your
[43:42] perfected them forever that are
[43:44] sanctified thank you Lord for your great
[43:46] professor you've given for us and Lord
[43:48] we just commit the service into your
[43:50] hands Lord have your way father in Jesus
[43:53] Christ's name we ask these things
[43:54] amen amen god bless y'all you may be
[43:57] seated this morning I want to take a
[44:01] title if I could I want to speak on a
[44:03] new generation now not a younger
[44:06] generation but a new generation so
[44:08] because when we think of a young
[44:10] generation we think of age but really
[44:13] it's it's not an age of a person that's
[44:16] the age of a person in the Lord they can
[44:18] be a youth you can be 90 years old and
[44:20] still be a youth in God right so this is
[44:22] for I believe it was for all of us but
[44:24] we read here and judges chapter eight
[44:27] that here we have Gideon and and this is
[44:30] if you if you read the book of Judges
[44:32] this is after the great victory that he
[44:33] had over the children of the east and
[44:35] over Midian and and and and he dealt
[44:38] with some other people so great
[44:40] victories had happened in the family
[44:41] where where God came down in it and and
[44:44] where get in he a few chapters before
[44:46] this he asks a question where is the god
[44:48] of our fathers have brought us out of
[44:50] out of Egypt and and the very God that
[44:52] brought them out of Egypt was he was in
[44:54] a form of an older man sitting under an
[44:56] oak tree and speaking to Gideon when he
[44:57] was threshing the wheat there in secret
[45:00] and and God became real to him he wasn't
[45:02] a god of history anymore but he was a
[45:04] present God and it's the same thing with
[45:06] us you know he can't be a God of history
[45:09] to us he's got to be the present God
[45:11] he's the I am and so God used Gideon to
[45:14] defeat the enemies of Israel and they
[45:16] had a great deliverance there and so no
[45:20] doubt Gideon's son and as other sons
[45:22] were witnesses of these things they saw
[45:24] this happen in the family
[45:25] but now they're come to time with the
[45:28] younger generation now I say this is not
[45:30] just age you know physical age but this
[45:32] is in the Lord through the younger ones
[45:34] that come up they have to take their
[45:36] position they have to take their place
[45:38] where it's not it's not mum and dad's or
[45:41] or the song leader or the or the
[45:43] minister or the Sunday School teachers
[45:45] testimony but it becomes their testimony
[45:48] where they instead of coming up behind
[45:50] and the older ones are fighting in the
[45:52] battle on the front they pick up their
[45:54] sword and they join the ranks I mean
[45:57] within our just war
[45:58] him behind him and and trying to dodge
[46:00] the fire that's the enemy but they pick
[46:02] up the sword they pick up the shield
[46:04] they put on the helmet of salvation and
[46:06] the full armor of God and they and they
[46:08] and they join the ranks in the front
[46:10] hallelujah so now here was here was a
[46:13] perfect opportunity for Gideon son now
[46:15] because notice as we maybe would just
[46:18] put them back up again
[46:20] so the enemies that he was commanded to
[46:23] slay they were already defeated they had
[46:26] already been taken captive
[46:27] they had no weapon in their hand I meant
[46:30] it's just as look at the conditions just
[46:32] manners this young man is going to step
[46:34] to the front he's going to draw a sword
[46:36] hallelujah is that the enemy is defeated
[46:39] the enemy has no weapon
[46:41] the enemy has resigned himself to the
[46:43] fact as he said here he said then since
[46:47] it says in verse 2 anyone they say rise
[46:49] up rise down and fall upon us for as the
[46:52] man is so so as a strength so these men
[46:56] know they're going to die and they know
[46:57] they're going to die this day they've
[46:59] resigned
[46:59] you've been resigned to this fact now
[47:01] I'm trying to label this because the
[47:03] devil knows his numbers up I mean
[47:06] because it says in Revelations chapter
[47:08] 12 and maybe we'll just read that I
[47:10] don't have it in my notes but if we go
[47:12] to Revelation chapter 12 we will see
[47:15] that he knows his numbers up now you see
[47:19] with people sometimes when they know
[47:22] that they have lost they react in
[47:24] different ways some people they they
[47:28] just get sad and they accept the fact
[47:30] that they have lost the battle and they
[47:31] just resigned to their fate
[47:33] other people get angry that they've lost
[47:36] and the devil gets angry he's he's that
[47:39] kind of a kind of an enemy he just gets
[47:41] angry that he's lost its his here in
[47:44] revelations chapter 12 it says we'll
[47:47] just read from verse 7 I know I this is
[47:50] one of my favorite parts of the
[47:52] scripture amen but um well it's all
[47:55] favorite but I like this I like it when
[47:58] when you read about your victory and his
[48:00] defeat hallelujah as I like to read
[48:03] those kind of things and so from
[48:05] revelations 12 and verse 7 it says and
[48:08] there was war in heaven Michael and his
[48:10] angels fought against the Dragon
[48:11] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[48:14] prevailed not and neither was their
[48:16] place found any more in heaven and the
[48:19] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[48:20] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[48:23] deceives the whole world was cast out
[48:25] into the earth and his angels were cast
[48:27] out with him and I heard a loud voice
[48:30] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[48:32] and strength and the Kingdom of our God
[48:35] and the power of us Christ for the
[48:37] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[48:39] which accused them before our God day
[48:42] and night now this is the day we're
[48:45] living in as the bride goes up Satan is
[48:48] cast down Alleluia and we know by the
[48:50] opening of the seven seals the prophet
[48:52] told us at that that it's not just
[48:54] because the seals are Christ being
[48:56] revealed we know that he says the seals
[48:58] are Christ but he also says it's the
[49:00] enemy being uncovered where all of us
[49:03] works down through the ages have been
[49:04] exposed so he can't hide in any place
[49:07] and he can't and he can't come in by
[49:09] deceit and in and in by us believing his
[49:12] lie then he can go up before God and say
[49:15] look they believe my life that that's
[49:17] how he becomes the accuser of the
[49:19] Brethren but because he's been exposed
[49:21] and we don't believe any of his life
[49:23] that's that that shuts his mouth because
[49:25] he has nothing against us that he can
[49:28] accuse God take to God and accuse God
[49:30] say God they've done this they've done
[49:32] this they've believed my lie here and
[49:33] they've done this all that's been struck
[49:35] off the prophet told us we never did it
[49:38] in the first place we justified the
[49:40] blood of Jesus Christ doesn't just cover
[49:41] our sin and annihilate so soon it
[49:44] cleanses us we have a clear deed
[49:46] hallelujah
[49:47] there's nothing held against us amen
[49:50] isn't that right that's what the blood
[49:52] does it doesn't just cover our sin and
[49:53] maybe be dealt with in a future event
[49:55] it's already dealt with a man it's as
[49:59] simple as a simple from your heart can
[50:00] facing God I'm wrong forgive me of my
[50:02] sin forgive me what I've done and that
[50:04] goes into the blood of Jesus Christ and
[50:06] the Prophet likens it to a tub of bleach
[50:09] we're ink ink being the sin falls into
[50:12] the bleach and you can't find the ink
[50:14] anymore it's broken up and done away
[50:16] with Alleluia
[50:18] I mean so that's how and so that's why
[50:22] the accuser he has nothing to he has no
[50:24] evidence anymore
[50:26] amen he goes up and says they did this
[50:28] they said this they thought this and God
[50:30] says where's and I can't find it it's
[50:32] not in my filing system and my filing
[50:35] system never gets a virus
[50:36] hallelujah it's always perfectly in
[50:39] order it doesn't need a defrag or
[50:40] whatever more it's already and and the
[50:42] evidence is gone olia and it says now it
[50:47] says in verse 11 and they overcame him
[50:49] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
[50:52] of their testimony now I just want to
[50:55] maybe remember we read about how he was
[50:57] called to draw a sword he had a weapon
[51:00] in his hand a sword now our testimony is
[51:03] us having evidence that his would works
[51:06] I mean that's our testimony I believe
[51:09] the Word of God it is faithful and true
[51:12] amen it applies to me I believe it
[51:15] myself and that's been your giving
[51:17] evidence that is Word is true that's
[51:19] your testimony so ever so they overcame
[51:23] him now this is you we have some
[51:24] overcoming you ever came him by the
[51:26] blood lame of the word of their
[51:27] testimony and they loved not their lives
[51:29] unto the death therefore rejoice ye
[51:32] heavens and ye that dwell in them now we
[51:34] dwell in heavenly places rejoice all ye
[51:39] hallelujah ye heavens and ye that dwell
[51:42] on them you say but we're not in a
[51:43] heaven no but we're in heavenly places
[51:46] amen
[51:47] we're in heavenly places so just rejoice
[51:49] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[51:51] to the sea we say but we're on terra
[51:54] firma we may be these bodies may be but
[51:57] we live in a different kind of realm
[51:59] that's why we don't need to be afraid of
[52:02] the devil wandering around like a
[52:04] roaring lion woe to the inhabitants of
[52:07] the scene of the earth for the devil is
[52:08] come down unto you having great wrath
[52:10] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[52:13] time see he's angry he noses his numbers
[52:17] up and he doesn't just go oh well too
[52:19] bad Noah gets angry about it you see a
[52:21] like yo like soccer hooligans and fans
[52:24] their team loses they get angry they
[52:26] burn cars they're right they whatever
[52:28] war he's angry that's just that in a
[52:32] minor form so but these men we're not
[52:37] that way
[52:38] they resign themselves to the fact that
[52:41] they had lost and they were going to die
[52:43] this day and so now but you see gideon
[52:48] wanted his son to take their lives
[52:50] because he wanted his son to know the
[52:53] victory is his i mean god wants us to
[52:57] realize we got to draw the sword draw
[53:01] the sword of the spirit which is the
[53:02] word of god we have to draw the sword
[53:05] amen and have confidence in our weapon
[53:08] but you see now he did not he did not
[53:12] because he was but a sea but the youth
[53:15] do not a sword for he feared because he
[53:18] was yet a youth he was looking at his
[53:20] own ability and the his fear can i do
[53:23] this job well well you have two enemies
[53:26] that are imprisoned they know they're
[53:28] going to die they're actually saying
[53:29] kill me
[53:31] amen and the devil he may be angry he
[53:34] may be roaring but he knows his numbers
[53:37] up he knows he knows he's done
[53:40] hallelujah he knows he's done because he
[53:42] knows his the people upon the earth
[53:44] whether you like to admit it or not he
[53:45] knows he's a bright upon the earth and
[53:47] sure all of hell may be here but all
[53:50] heaven is here also and heaven is always
[53:52] greater than the darkness Amen gross
[53:54] darkness may cover the people but this
[53:56] light hallelujah is the light of the
[53:58] word that's never been so bright as in
[54:00] this hour I mean all hell may be upon
[54:03] the earth but all heaven is here also
[54:05] hallelujah so we don't need to fear he
[54:08] freed drawing his sword to kill these
[54:09] captives we shouldn't fear or doesn't
[54:13] work has it worked before I mean has it
[54:15] worked before it'll work again the scan
[54:18] doesn't jam it doesn't rust it doesn't
[54:21] need maintenance in that way I mean this
[54:23] weapon works but you could have
[54:25] confidence the same sword Amen that
[54:28] worked in history works today
[54:30] hallelujah but he wants you to raise up
[54:33] take God at His Word thank God and his
[54:36] work doesn't just carry it round black
[54:39] hey he had a piano sheath he had a sword
[54:42] however he carried it I've got a sword
[54:44] look at me I've got a Bible he was
[54:47] walking around but he had to draw it one
[54:50] day but he was afraid he says
[54:52] but I'm by the youth but then but that's
[54:56] the problem he didn't look at where he
[54:58] was he didn't look who he was we we read
[55:02] there where
[55:03] Gideon asked these two what were these
[55:05] people like the manner of men of whom
[55:07] you a ball this is in the first
[55:09] verse here verse 17 and they answered as
[55:12] thou art as they were each one resembled
[55:15] the child of a king they were his family
[55:18] now that's that's what the enemy viewed
[55:20] these people is and this is what this
[55:22] youth was getting in son amen so but his
[55:27] son wasn't viewing himself in this way
[55:29] I'm but a youth I can't do this job he
[55:32] was ordained to do the job but he didn't
[55:36] he didn't draw a sword and he didn't
[55:38] take their lives he didn't stand up and
[55:40] have his own testimony that the Lord
[55:42] works that the word works now we read
[55:48] here and we read here in Timothy Paul is
[55:52] speaking to his spiritual son Timothy I
[55:55] commit this charge under the son Timothy
[55:57] according to the prophecies which went
[55:59] before on me that thou mightest that by
[56:03] them might us war a good warfare now
[56:07] here we are and it's the same thing with
[56:10] us Timothy Timothy was a young man he
[56:14] says another place let no man despise
[56:15] thy youth but he had to know how to
[56:19] fight a good warfare and we have to know
[56:22] how to fight a good warfare also it's
[56:24] not enough see the enemy the greatest
[56:28] thing you can do in a war has a depth to
[56:31] what your enemy is doing great victories
[56:34] are one win when when you change your
[56:36] tactics to defeat what the enemy is
[56:38] doing if you just plow on with the same
[56:40] old thing you know you take you take the
[56:43] age of the musket with you Napoleon in
[56:46] those ones they just lined up in rows
[56:48] they had their muskets they stood there
[56:51] not really far from each other and they
[56:53] just fired shots at each other fixed
[56:56] bayonets and charged in and did all
[56:57] those things that didn't work in World
[57:00] War one because the warfare had evolved
[57:03] and they had to change their tactics and
[57:05] you
[57:05] the static world will one when they when
[57:08] they we're not going for the top of the
[57:09] trenches to to charge through no means
[57:11] let do you know the actually initially
[57:12] star just marching they actually just
[57:16] started marching because they're still
[57:17] trying to go out of napoleon's playbook
[57:19] and they just got mowed down by machine
[57:21] guns but they had to change what they
[57:23] are doing and it's the same thing with
[57:25] us now we may try something and we see
[57:28] the enemy as as working against us but
[57:31] if it doesn't work you were to change
[57:33] your tactic they meant you got to change
[57:36] your tactic it's like in a family trying
[57:38] to win over a loved one or or a child or
[57:40] something you see they're not responding
[57:42] the right way like you want them to
[57:44] respond you got to change your tactic
[57:46] you got to change how you relate to them
[57:47] how you speak to them how you deal with
[57:50] them amen because the devil's caning
[57:54] he studied you you've got to study him
[57:56] do you study your enemy
[57:58] it's like traps and snares the Bible
[58:00] speaks of traps and snares now I can put
[58:02] up a photo of a possum track or a trap
[58:05] for a stone or something and and you
[58:08] would look at that and you'd say there's
[58:10] nothing I'd say you know would that trap
[58:12] you and you look at it safe course not I
[58:14] don't want some egg in a trap you know I
[58:17] would never crawl into that thing to get
[58:19] some old rotten apple or pig's head or
[58:21] something but the reason is is because
[58:23] it's not made for you it's made for a
[58:25] possum or a stud or a pig or whatever
[58:27] it's not made for you so the devil
[58:29] doesn't put out something to you there's
[58:31] not appealing he puts out a trap that
[58:34] would entice you
[58:35] because he knows human nature amen he
[58:39] knows human nature and we will may be
[58:41] annoyed by something but because he is
[58:44] maybe changed his tecnique like the
[58:47] things that you maybe fought against
[58:48] when you're a child or a teenager now
[58:50] you've overcome them he just changes his
[58:52] tactic he changes his warfare we have to
[58:57] change our warfare also the Word of God
[58:59] is still our weapon and it meets in time
[59:02] conditions it has been sent to overcome
[59:04] the enemy but you got to use wisdom and
[59:07] say now how do I fight this warfare you
[59:12] must know how to fight a good warfare
[59:14] yeah now see here in this last verse I
[59:17] charge you I come out on to the son
[59:18] timber
[59:19] according to the prophecies which went
[59:21] which went on before thee that thou by
[59:26] their modest war a good warfare now when
[59:29] I read this I was thinking now we have
[59:31] prophecies that our God on before us you
[59:34] may not have been aware of it but you
[59:36] have been prophesied of amen from
[59:39] Genesis to Revelation this prophecies
[59:42] concerning you and you may not have been
[59:44] aware of it
[59:45] but you're a fulfillment if you're the
[59:47] Bride of Christ of this hour you are a
[59:49] fulfillment of prophecy amen that
[59:51] there's been prophets have prophesied
[59:53] foretold that there will be a people
[59:55] rise in the endtime hallelujah and you
[59:58] you just happen to be here so by those
[1:00:02] prophecies you may know how to fight a
[1:00:04] good warfare have you looked at the
[1:00:07] prophecies concerning you Jesus knew the
[1:00:10] word he had to fulfill he looked at the
[1:00:12] prophecies concerning himself he knew he
[1:00:14] was there to fulfill Isaiah the Spirit
[1:00:17] Lord has upon me to know to preach the
[1:00:19] gospel to the poor and said it captain
[1:00:21] him that have bruised and you know
[1:00:23] you're a priest acceptable year of the
[1:00:25] Lord and in that prophecy he kept the
[1:00:27] last verse in half because the second
[1:00:29] part of that last verse that prophecy
[1:00:31] was for a second coming but he found it
[1:00:33] in the Book of Isaiah he didn't disclose
[1:00:35] his eyes and flip it open and point to a
[1:00:37] scripture and read he found what he was
[1:00:39] looking for cause he knew he was here
[1:00:41] to fulfill that prophecy now you have to
[1:00:44] know the prophecies you have been seen
[1:00:46] to feel full we'll just go through to
[1:00:49] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:00:52] honour to him for the marriage of the
[1:00:54] lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:00:56] herself ready and to her was granted
[1:00:58] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:01:00] clean and white for the white linen for
[1:01:03] the fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:01:04] saints and he saith unto me write
[1:01:06] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:01:08] the marriage supper of the lamb and he
[1:01:10] saith unto me these are the true sayings
[1:01:12] of God
[1:01:13] that's one prophecy I mean you were
[1:01:15] where you say well how do you fight a
[1:01:17] good warfare by that prophecy
[1:01:19] well this prophecy is telling me these
[1:01:21] are people being going to be married to
[1:01:23] our Lord Jesus Christ that they become
[1:01:25] the wife of the Lamb now if they are the
[1:01:27] wife of the Lamb it's just like it well
[1:01:30] it still is today
[1:01:31] it's still illegal for me to go marry a
[1:01:33] dog he said well that's over that's very
[1:01:36] silly but I can't marry something that's
[1:01:38] not my species I mean I had to find
[1:01:41] someone that matched me oh yeah I'm so
[1:01:45] glad I did
[1:01:46] and it's like any any man looking for a
[1:01:49] woman to marry or vice versa you're
[1:01:51] looking for someone that matches you
[1:01:53] hallelujah so now if God if the lamb is
[1:01:57] looking for another lamb to marry he's
[1:02:00] looking for people that have his nature
[1:02:02] that have his characteristics they have
[1:02:05] the same life that was in him as in her
[1:02:08] amen so now you're going to say well how
[1:02:11] do you fight how do you fight a wolf
[1:02:13] here based on that what Jesus knew who
[1:02:16] he was he knew he was the Lamb of God to
[1:02:18] take away the sins of the world he knew
[1:02:20] that he was the Messiah that had come to
[1:02:22] the earth he knew that he was God's
[1:02:24] chosen vessel to redeem mankind that's
[1:02:28] what he knew for this cause I've come
[1:02:30] into the world and he stood upon the
[1:02:32] word he didn't use his great power to
[1:02:34] overcome Satan he said it is written man
[1:02:36] shall not live by bread alone that's
[1:02:39] just that you know Moses said that in
[1:02:42] the book of Deuteronomy he just pulled
[1:02:44] out he had a big arsenal that's like you
[1:02:47] know Jesus had a big arsenal of word to
[1:02:50] to go in and get to combat the enemy's
[1:02:52] attack he just pulled that out it is
[1:02:53] written it is written it is written and
[1:02:57] the devil came back yes and well it's
[1:02:58] also rendered he says it's also written
[1:03:00] and the devil thought he would have had
[1:03:02] him there made him fall but he came
[1:03:04] against someone that he didn't know
[1:03:05] anything then it said he never conquered
[1:03:08] I mean came against before and the devil
[1:03:11] who lost that fight so now he stood upon
[1:03:14] the word that was according to him and
[1:03:16] he subjected himself to the scripture
[1:03:19] that he had to fulfill just like when he
[1:03:22] went to Calvary as a man he subjected
[1:03:24] this flesh why do you think he had such
[1:03:26] agony in the garden you know drops of
[1:03:29] blood he sweating drops of blood and
[1:03:31] great agony there and gets M&E because
[1:03:34] he knew what he had to fulfill he knew
[1:03:36] that he was going to be headed at the
[1:03:38] hands of wicked men he knew is going to
[1:03:40] be mud beyond any man he knew those
[1:03:42] things and so he knew
[1:03:45] he had to fulfill that and not only just
[1:03:47] the physical wounding he knew he had to
[1:03:49] go to hell with the sins of the world on
[1:03:50] him and that's far worse than a physical
[1:03:53] wounding and so now that's why I had the
[1:03:56] great agony but he subjected himself and
[1:03:59] that great trial he subjected this flesh
[1:04:02] for the Word of God and that's how we
[1:04:04] overcame and it must be to say now
[1:04:06] that's how he he fought a good warfare
[1:04:08] that's how he overcame right and so it
[1:04:12] has to be the same thing if if he
[1:04:14] overcame that way then the bride will
[1:04:16] sure overcome that way when we subject
[1:04:18] ourselves to the word that's a lot of to
[1:04:20] us to fulfill hallelujah amen and he saw
[1:04:25] also the reason he did it because the
[1:04:28] joy that was set before him the
[1:04:30] scripture says there was a joy set
[1:04:31] before him that's why he he considered
[1:04:34] his own life less important than your
[1:04:36] life hallelujah because if he didn't go
[1:04:39] we wouldn't be here and there wouldn't
[1:04:42] be a marriage supper of the Lamb and
[1:04:43] there wouldn't be the redeemed of all
[1:04:44] ages gathered around the throne amen and
[1:04:48] he would have lost a part of himself he
[1:04:50] would have lost the feminist part of
[1:04:52] himself so there was a joy set before
[1:04:54] him that's why he waited up sit down
[1:04:56] it's a greater joy the joy of the joy of
[1:04:59] my children my wife being gathered to me
[1:05:01] how Lou you that I can I can become one
[1:05:04] with her as a far greater joy I mean in
[1:05:07] the suffering I may have to go through
[1:05:09] to fulfill the scripture and it should
[1:05:11] be the same thing with us amen
[1:05:13] heaven is far greater than we can
[1:05:15] imagine hallelujah and it's far more
[1:05:18] worth it then than anything that we may
[1:05:22] have to physically think we have to give
[1:05:24] up amen
[1:05:27] don't you want to go to heaven don't you
[1:05:30] want to go on a rapture don't you want
[1:05:32] to miss a tribulation hallelujah you
[1:05:35] know it's like someone giving you a
[1:05:37] hundred million dollars and you say no
[1:05:39] I'm not going to use it I'm not going to
[1:05:41] touch it it's kind of a bit insane amen
[1:05:44] no old people will think different of
[1:05:46] because I have this you know they may
[1:05:48] think good of you because you got money
[1:05:49] but anyway they'll think differently
[1:05:51] anyway maybe it's not such a good
[1:05:53] example but you know you don't want to
[1:05:55] just take the whole thing
[1:05:58] take the joy I trust he gives you
[1:06:00] realize of faith amen that is not a hope
[1:06:03] so faith is a substance of things hoped
[1:06:07] for the evidence of things unseen
[1:06:09] now the word hope there in the New
[1:06:10] Testament is not like you buy I trust no
[1:06:13] one does here amen but it's like if
[1:06:16] someone goes and buys a lotto ticket
[1:06:18] there's a big I don't know what the
[1:06:19] crazy jackpots are now you know I'm
[1:06:21] gonna win this I hope I win this that's
[1:06:24] just there may be a stab in the dark
[1:06:26] kind of hope that's not Bible Hope Bible
[1:06:29] hope is an expectation it's going to
[1:06:31] happen I mean that is Bible hope so if
[1:06:34] you have faith faith is the evidence of
[1:06:36] things unseen so it's actually something
[1:06:38] you possess that it's going to happen
[1:06:41] it's not a hope so well I think this
[1:06:43] will work and I think it'll work out no
[1:06:45] it's a it's an evidence you've received
[1:06:49] something that it's going to happen
[1:06:52] hallelujah amen now the marriage of the
[1:06:56] lamb has come she has made herself ready
[1:07:00] because it was granted unto her that
[1:07:02] should be arrayed in fine linen which is
[1:07:03] the righteousness of the saints now
[1:07:05] that's a prophecy we are living out
[1:07:09] there prophecy amen
[1:07:11] and if you're not arrayed in the
[1:07:13] righteousness of saints it's here to be
[1:07:14] arraigned arrayed in hallelujah the
[1:07:18] wedding supper call has come brother
[1:07:20] Brown preaches a sermon as your life
[1:07:23] worthy of the gospel and he takes the
[1:07:25] parable of the wedding feast and the
[1:07:27] recess is three pulls there's three
[1:07:28] calls to this wedding feast and he said
[1:07:31] to Pentecost and into the last one was
[1:07:34] called the good and the bad to halt the
[1:07:35] blind whatever the lame bring them to my
[1:07:37] feast and he says doubt the third the
[1:07:40] third call the third pull invitation to
[1:07:43] the wedding supper is this word it's not
[1:07:45] the discernment or the healing it's now
[1:07:47] the word he sees the Pentecostals turned
[1:07:49] down amen this spiritual feast and they
[1:07:53] so they turn down their invitation to
[1:07:54] the winning supper amen but unto us who
[1:07:58] will halt lame and blind in the highways
[1:08:00] and byways the good the bad whatever
[1:08:03] condition we were in he doesn't care
[1:08:05] come to the feast hallelujah and we come
[1:08:08] to the door Christ Jesus and and we
[1:08:10] repeatedly back
[1:08:11] Theisen his name and we and he fills us
[1:08:13] with a spirit we'll get a raid in a new
[1:08:15] room how they were anointed our feet are
[1:08:18] washed I mean the dirt of the world has
[1:08:20] been washed us wash washed off us
[1:08:22] hallelujah been anointed with the Spirit
[1:08:24] of God would be arrayed in a robe and
[1:08:27] when you go after because it's a process
[1:08:29] when you'd come into a wedding feasts in
[1:08:31] that day that's what happened
[1:08:33] your feet will wash your rate at a
[1:08:35] different robe and you anointed you
[1:08:36] cursed you made welcome and you went
[1:08:38] into the feast so it doesn't matter if
[1:08:39] you had the finest clothes on or for
[1:08:41] your threadbare after you go through
[1:08:44] that process you all look the same
[1:08:46] hallelujah it's the same thing with us
[1:08:49] I'm glad about that here's another one
[1:08:52] blessed be the God and Father our Lord
[1:08:54] Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:08:56] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:08:58] in Christ according as he has chosen us
[1:09:01] in him before the foundation of the
[1:09:02] world that we should be holy and without
[1:09:04] blame before him and love having
[1:09:07] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:09:09] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:09:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:09:14] will to the praise of the glory of His
[1:09:16] grace sure and he hath made us accepted
[1:09:18] in the beloved hallelujah there wasn't
[1:09:22] just for the Ephesians that was a
[1:09:23] prophecy I mean because there had to be
[1:09:25] a people that would be predestinated
[1:09:28] unto the adoption of children so they
[1:09:32] would be placed amen because we know
[1:09:34] adoption in the Bible is not you you
[1:09:37] getting someone out of a family that's
[1:09:39] not a blood relation to you and they
[1:09:41] become your child that's not Bible
[1:09:43] adoption Bible adoption is there's a
[1:09:45] child born into the family and when they
[1:09:47] come to a certain age they are placed in
[1:09:49] a in a place of responsibility in the
[1:09:51] family that's Bible adoption it means
[1:09:55] that we have been predestinated unto
[1:09:57] he's predestined us unto the adoption of
[1:10:00] children by Jesus Christ so we have been
[1:10:04] predestinated to come to our position in
[1:10:07] him amen that's how our destiny has been
[1:10:12] predetermined that we would come to our
[1:10:14] place we say well how does how does that
[1:10:19] how do how do we wore a good work
[1:10:21] warfare by that prophecy well those who
[1:10:24] have been
[1:10:25] ordained to be in their place I mean
[1:10:28] ordained they've been predestinated unto
[1:10:31] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] to himself as exactly as as Caleb and
[1:10:36] Joshua and those ones that came out of
[1:10:38] Egypt they were Caleb was predestinated
[1:10:40] to take that mountain in the promised
[1:10:43] land that was his position in the land
[1:10:45] that was his place in the body right
[1:10:49] that was this place in the body just
[1:10:51] like we have different places in the
[1:10:53] body
[1:10:53] I mean his ministry gifts and helps and
[1:10:55] governments and and you know different
[1:10:58] gifts like that and God places us all in
[1:11:00] the body of Christ we're not all the
[1:11:02] same we're not all the finger or an eye
[1:11:04] or a foot or a ear or whatever we have
[1:11:07] all different roles to play in the body
[1:11:09] and God by His Holy Spirit takes herself
[1:11:11] to him birth and he moves us into that
[1:11:13] place and it's the same thing with with
[1:11:16] Caleb coming out of Egypt by Moses he
[1:11:19] came out of Egypt and then the Holy
[1:11:21] Spirit moved him into his place in the
[1:11:24] body in the promised land and he was
[1:11:26] then living in that place yes Amen do it
[1:11:30] one following me so he was predestinated
[1:11:33] to that position or to that adoption in
[1:11:35] the body and so he took it he ward a
[1:11:39] good warfare he said well how did he had
[1:11:42] a war good wittle' by that he says
[1:11:44] there's a place in this land I want that
[1:11:46] Mountain God give me that mountain and
[1:11:51] God placed him where where he was meant
[1:11:55] to be in the land amen that's how Ward a
[1:12:00] good warfare now 2nd Timothy 1:5 2:8
[1:12:16] now it says here when I call to
[1:12:19] remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
[1:12:24] in me was dropped first of my
[1:12:26] grandmother Lois and in my and my mother
[1:12:29] Eunice and I am persuaded that is in
[1:12:31] thee also wherefore I put thee in
[1:12:34] remembrance that they'll stir up the
[1:12:36] gift of God which is in thee by the
[1:12:39] putting a lot of hands for God has not
[1:12:41] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:12:44] and of love and of a sound mind be not
[1:12:47] thou therefore ashamed of the testimony
[1:12:49] of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but
[1:12:52] be thou partaker of the afflictions of
[1:12:55] the Gospel according to the power of God
[1:12:58] so here he was if we walk if we find any
[1:13:02] good wolf here there's an enemy to fight
[1:13:05] against and he will try and discourage
[1:13:07] us he will try and stop the gift of God
[1:13:11] operating in our lives now the gift
[1:13:14] faith is a gift faith is a gift we all
[1:13:19] have a gift you say but I'm not a singer
[1:13:21] or a musician or a preacher or whatever
[1:13:23] but we all have a gift we all have a
[1:13:26] gift of faith right but in the enemy
[1:13:29] just like Timothy here something came
[1:13:32] against Timothy that actually disabled
[1:13:35] his ministry something came against them
[1:13:39] then he wasn't prop maybe wasn't
[1:13:41] prepared for
[1:13:42] and it actually derailed them a bit I
[1:13:44] mean so this is what happened to him so
[1:13:47] Paul is writing to Timothy saying stir
[1:13:50] up the gift the gift of God in your life
[1:13:53] he's saying this is how you actually
[1:13:55] overcome this problem amen because the
[1:13:58] enemy we will be tested by every spirit
[1:14:01] we will be tested by every spirit in the
[1:14:04] siege and because the devil changes his
[1:14:07] warfare it's like if you're trying to
[1:14:10] take a fortified position you may send
[1:14:12] in your infantry first they get mowed
[1:14:14] down ok now we've got to change what we
[1:14:16] do and then maybe now we'll drop some
[1:14:17] paratroopers and behind and try that
[1:14:19] making it wiped out well we'll change
[1:14:21] what we'll do you change your tactics ok
[1:14:23] now we do know you know an artillery
[1:14:25] bombardment maybe a spy get in and do
[1:14:27] some infiltration
[1:14:29] whatever more they the enemy is always
[1:14:31] changing his tactics and so the enemy
[1:14:34] will now change his tactics against you
[1:14:37] he will and so now you have to be
[1:14:40] prepared now because the enemy will come
[1:14:42] and he may be defeated one time it's
[1:14:44] like with Jesus after I think when he
[1:14:46] was in the wilderness that says and
[1:14:48] Satan just left him for a season the
[1:14:50] devil didn't just give up he came back
[1:14:52] again he changed his tactics and as to
[1:14:56] save them against us the devil has and
[1:14:58] will changes tactics against you
[1:15:01] Amen it's just like now rule one sweet
[1:15:04] group as brother Bram said rule one big
[1:15:06] sweet group but you be careful the enemy
[1:15:09] will come in and he'll try and scatter
[1:15:11] you try and divide you amen so the enemy
[1:15:14] no because the devil was cast out by
[1:15:16] sickness and unbelief and disease and
[1:15:18] all these things and so now he changed
[1:15:19] this tactic now how could I get in among
[1:15:21] these people because I can't have God's
[1:15:23] people together I mean because of this
[1:15:26] harmony in the body nothing can stand
[1:15:28] before yo I can't stand before those
[1:15:30] kind of people it's like when when I
[1:15:33] think it's in the Psalms David said how
[1:15:35] great is the unity among brethren that's
[1:15:37] like the anointing all that runs off
[1:15:39] Aaron's beard now Aaron had to be
[1:15:43] anointed with that anointing oil in
[1:15:45] order to operate as the high priest amen
[1:15:50] he had to be anointed in order to
[1:15:52] operate as the high priest and David's
[1:15:55] actually saying that if there's unity
[1:15:56] among the people then the body of Christ
[1:15:59] can operate according to what God wants
[1:16:01] them to be aim it that's why unity is
[1:16:04] very important so the devil comes and he
[1:16:06] tries to you know bring in a fuss or a
[1:16:08] misunderstanding or whatever more and
[1:16:10] you know we have different we have
[1:16:12] different personalities and iron
[1:16:14] sharpens iron and you know all these
[1:16:15] things go on and we have
[1:16:17] misunderstandings it's the enemy trying
[1:16:19] to get in it's the enemy because love
[1:16:22] now covers a multitude of sins
[1:16:24] doesn't you know so someone can do
[1:16:27] something wrong against someone but now
[1:16:29] if you hold that against them then now
[1:16:32] the devil can have a channel to work I
[1:16:35] mean and if that doesn't work well then
[1:16:37] maybe he'll he'll get you lifted up and
[1:16:39] pride
[1:16:40] see I was reading through if you go
[1:16:42] study the Kings who studied the Kings in
[1:16:46] the Bible always look at where maybe we
[1:16:49] have voice in my mind look at where the
[1:16:52] believers failed go from Genesis and
[1:16:55] study where the believers failed because
[1:16:58] brother MCS we should study our enemy we
[1:17:01] should study our enemy so we should
[1:17:03] actually see not only where they
[1:17:04] succeeded but where they failed because
[1:17:08] the enemy will come against you in the
[1:17:10] same way and he will try and get you to
[1:17:13] fail the same way they did you say well
[1:17:16] but they were just under the blood of
[1:17:19] bulls and goats run like we're under the
[1:17:20] blood of Jesus Christ but there's no
[1:17:22] temptation which is common to men that
[1:17:25] that we are attacked by right and so now
[1:17:28] you see use our you see here's a car you
[1:17:32] see driving Josiah might get the wrong
[1:17:33] but they but they were doing God
[1:17:36] prospered them and bless them and bless
[1:17:37] them and bless them and then they came
[1:17:39] to a place where thought they could just
[1:17:41] do anything and God will just bless it
[1:17:43] because they are lifted up and prayed
[1:17:45] because of where God had placed them but
[1:17:48] in Deuteronomy it says that the king's
[1:17:50] army to write out the law because that
[1:17:53] would keep them humble because they
[1:17:55] would see the blessings and the cursings
[1:17:58] of the law so they would see they would
[1:18:00] see the reward by keeping the word but
[1:18:02] then they'd also see the penalty for
[1:18:04] disobeying the word amen and now you say
[1:18:08] but we're not under the law we may not
[1:18:10] be under the law because the Spirit of
[1:18:12] God comes into our lives and causes us
[1:18:15] to live the word right I meant but then
[1:18:18] also on the same token there is a
[1:18:20] penalty for disobeying the Word of God
[1:18:23] amen but grace enables us to live the
[1:18:26] word because it changes our nature that
[1:18:28] is not our own carnal nature ruling us
[1:18:31] anymore where we do everything according
[1:18:33] to lust the I the pride of life and the
[1:18:35] flesh and everything but it's now his
[1:18:37] life in us that we live according to the
[1:18:39] word but you see the devil try and get
[1:18:42] us lifted up and pray amen and false
[1:18:46] humility false humility
[1:18:50] he will try and get us a truth because
[1:18:52] he'll change his tactic against us I
[1:18:55] meant so you got to look at look at
[1:18:59] where they fail they stir up the gift of
[1:19:02] God which is in thee by the putting on
[1:19:05] of hands now we all have a gift of faith
[1:19:08] you got to stir up that faith amen
[1:19:11] stir up when you say well how do you
[1:19:12] stir up that faith you got to have a
[1:19:14] testimony service you got to you have to
[1:19:17] you have to go back through your life
[1:19:19] and say God you brought me here you
[1:19:22] called me out of the world you spoke to
[1:19:24] me you separated me how Lia from the
[1:19:27] spirit of this world you transform me
[1:19:30] you've redeemed me you've saved me has
[1:19:33] he done it for you I mean you've
[1:19:35] returned back in your life and say well
[1:19:37] he moved back there
[1:19:38] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:40] forever he's allowed me to come to this
[1:19:42] place what do you think Paul and Silas
[1:19:44] were there in the jail they weren't you
[1:19:47] know they begin to sing and they begin
[1:19:51] to I believe testified to one another I
[1:19:53] mean they would beaten down saying well
[1:19:56] this is the end and you know we ran a
[1:19:59] good race and we've got out in a few
[1:20:01] scrapes but I don't see how we can get
[1:20:03] out of this one
[1:20:04] no they begin to sing they begin to pray
[1:20:07] they say thank you Lord amen and it
[1:20:11] stirred up a gift the gift of faith in
[1:20:13] their lives and God came down and they
[1:20:16] were loosed it's always good always have
[1:20:23] a positive confession the devil may be
[1:20:25] on your case but say Lord you're greater
[1:20:27] than that enemy you've allowed this to
[1:20:29] happen because you want to show me
[1:20:31] something of yourself in this battle I
[1:20:33] mean it's the reason you have the battle
[1:20:35] our God isn't in the back looking and
[1:20:38] with the binoculars saying how you doing
[1:20:40] in the front I mean he's he's fighting
[1:20:43] before you he's in the front row I'll
[1:20:46] show you how it's done
[1:20:48] hallelujah that's exactly how it is yes
[1:20:53] but you see but you see Gideon's son was
[1:21:00] afraid
[1:21:01] he was afraid will this work can I
[1:21:03] actually take the lives of these enemies
[1:21:05] we can't be afraid God didn't our Lord
[1:21:10] Jesus didn't send this message to make
[1:21:11] us afraid if it works or not
[1:21:13] amen he didn't send it to make this
[1:21:15] Bible live that would be afraid if the
[1:21:17] Bible works or not amen
[1:21:20] there's life in this word where it will
[1:21:23] produce what it's meant to produce we
[1:21:25] don't need to worry how it's going to
[1:21:27] work you just yield yourself to it and
[1:21:29] there's a life in it you see this missus
[1:21:31] has gone around the world it has a life
[1:21:33] of its own people have thrown it out
[1:21:35] there's a there's a buried
[1:21:38] Aboriginal church in in in Australia
[1:21:43] somebody had a whole bunch of missus
[1:21:45] books they threw it into the trash this
[1:21:48] is a bridge no guy comes along picks it
[1:21:51] up he begins to read it he becomes a
[1:21:53] pasta there's a church and there's
[1:21:56] heaven more than one place God allowed
[1:21:58] that to happen amen and there's far more
[1:22:00] supernatural things in just people
[1:22:02] throwing out books people picking out
[1:22:04] books I mean this brother ro Shannon and
[1:22:06] the Punjab in in India picked up a book

[1:22:18] all over that northern part of India and
[1:22:20] places where there's anti conversion

[1:22:24] book and said I want to know what this
[1:22:26] is hallelujah and this farm will besides
[1:22:31] in just those two but there's a life in
[1:22:34] this word you don't know what it will do
[1:22:36] to someone I didn't know what it would
[1:22:38] do to me when I first plugged it in my
[1:22:39] ears and listens good morning friends
[1:22:42] hallelujah amen there's a life in it you

[1:22:49] I've had the experience I don't have the
[1:22:51] church to guide me whatever more I had
[1:22:53] the message in the Bible and God came in
[1:22:55] quickened it hallelujah I'm glad this
[1:22:59] amen and it still works today it still
[1:23:02] works today

[1:23:22] he was just a young boy David wasn't
[1:23:24] very old when he killed Goliath
[1:23:26] hallelujah
[1:23:28] they may be young but they look at age
[1:23:30] don't look at age say I used to you know
[1:23:34] that's like when you first get a child
[1:23:36] in your arms I often think what is in
[1:23:39] this child you don't know what's in that
[1:23:42] child even they say well this is the man
[1:23:45] versus the dead this is you know but
[1:23:46] what suddenly you think you think we're
[1:23:50] most of all any even even the prophet
[1:23:52] Elijah are you summer freeze yeah yeah
[1:23:54] for the example he was just he just came
[1:23:56] out of the wilderness
[1:23:57] do you think his parents really knew
[1:23:59] what was in him
[1:24:00] this one this one God is gonna use and
[1:24:03] he's gonna go on a rapture and he's
[1:24:06] gonna stand against all this bow worship
[1:24:08] we detest do you think they knew what
[1:24:10] was in him Peter James and John you know
[1:24:14] they're they're fishermen daddy's picked

[1:24:19] to the kingdom he's gonna fulfill the
[1:24:23] prophecy of Joel off I'll pull my spirit
[1:24:26] out upon all flesh and he'll stand they
[1:24:27] say this is that spoken by the Prophet
[1:24:29] Joel and day of Pentecost do you think
[1:24:31] then you they don't know we take moody
[1:24:34] or you know some of the great some of
[1:24:36] the great evangelists and things of you
[1:24:38] know in our era all the other former age
[1:24:40] do you think they're their parents knew
[1:24:43] what was in them know what's in your
[1:24:46] children have you ever thought about
[1:24:48] them in a spiritual way what gift
[1:24:51] there's something in every child
[1:24:53] there's a reason they're in your family
[1:24:55] there are reason that they've heard this
[1:24:57] word there's a reason it's not a
[1:24:59] haphazard thing that they sit and
[1:25:01] they're in the presence of God
[1:25:02] hallelujah and they see you've been
[1:25:04] changed there's a reason and you've got
[1:25:07] to look at them and say and prayerfully
[1:25:09] say God what is in my child I want to
[1:25:11] see you express if it's the sing if it's
[1:25:14] to pray if it's just to be an unseen one
[1:25:17] that's the unseen part of the body
[1:25:19] whatever part of the body that to
[1:25:21] fulfill I say Lord I want to see that
[1:25:23] manifested of
[1:25:24] yes they're not just children Amy and
[1:25:29] all the children say Amen you know just
[1:25:34] a little one
[1:25:35] hallelujah yes Amen now so we have to
[1:25:43] bring them up that they're right by us
[1:25:46] we don't have to tell them everything
[1:25:48] that we fighters as parents but bring
[1:25:52] them up to where you are how God is
[1:25:55] alive he's he's risen he's present now
[1:26:04] we read in 2nd Samuel there comes a time
[1:26:09] where whether the next generation rises
[1:26:13] in Israel where David by this time David
[1:26:17] is already the king his king has been
[1:26:19] established but now the Philistines make
[1:26:23] war again you'll notice in the Bible
[1:26:26] such an important a crucial time when
[1:26:30] the younger generation comes up yeah you
[1:26:33] see with the Kings especially some of
[1:26:36] the Kings that come up they either do
[1:26:39] like their father did if they're good or
[1:26:42] they're evil but sometimes there's such
[1:26:44] a change where you see some of the Kings
[1:26:46] God supernaturally delivers the nation
[1:26:49] these fear and the nations around them
[1:26:51] because they're worshiping God
[1:26:53] incredible things happen and then the
[1:26:55] son comes to the throne and it's like
[1:26:57] he's never been there before and he just
[1:27:00] does exactly what the you know yeah yeah
[1:27:02] there's quite a few kings the very
[1:27:04] enemies that they that Israel defeated
[1:27:07] God defeated them he takes their gods
[1:27:09] and he sits them up in Israel and he's
[1:27:13] an Annie and I I you know I think what
[1:27:17] on earth possess someone to take the
[1:27:21] very one the very God that was defeated
[1:27:23] that didn't help their enemies and he
[1:27:25] began to worship that God are they
[1:27:27] defeated people we could have a sermon
[1:27:32] right now don't worship the god of this
[1:27:34] world do not worship the god of
[1:27:36] denomination do not worship the God
[1:27:38] anything out here it's being defeated
[1:27:40] it's been defeated
[1:27:42] don't don't worship put it in any formal
[1:27:44] manner or shape
[1:27:46] why-why-why take those things and put it
[1:27:49] in your house and and and give it
[1:27:50] obedience it didn't help them it won't
[1:27:53] help you amen this word will help you
[1:27:58] God is for us always know God is for you
[1:28:02] he's not against you our Lord is for us
[1:28:06] amen the Bible says that he's our
[1:28:08] advocate
[1:28:09] he's on our side amen now so moreover
[1:28:16] the Philistines had yet war again with
[1:28:17] Israel now this is very different from
[1:28:20] from Gideon son
[1:28:22] these ones are fighting with Israel and
[1:28:26] David went down and his servants with
[1:28:28] them and fought against the sons of the
[1:28:30] giant the weight of whose spear away
[1:28:33] three hundred shekels of brass and
[1:28:35] weight he'd been girded with a new sword
[1:28:38] thought to have slain David but ever
[1:28:41] shied the son of Zillah secured him
[1:28:45] helped him and smote the Philistine and
[1:28:47] killed him then the men of David swear
[1:28:49] unto him saying thou shalt no more go
[1:28:52] out with us to battle that that thou
[1:28:56] quench not the light of Israel oops
[1:29:01] how long I got more of the scripture
[1:29:05] maybe it's just in the wrong place
[1:29:07] yes and it came to pass after this that
[1:29:10] there was again a better with the
[1:29:12] Philistines at gob in ceviche the
[1:29:17] Hoscheit slew Sabbath which was of the
[1:29:21] sons of the giant then there was again a
[1:29:23] battle and God with the Philistines then
[1:29:26] Elden the son of I cannot pronounce that
[1:29:30] the Bethea might slay the brother of
[1:29:32] goliath look at the art this the staff
[1:29:35] of whose spear was like a Weaver's beam
[1:29:37] and there was yellow battle and gasps
[1:29:39] where was a man of great stature that
[1:29:42] was on every hand six fingers and on
[1:29:46] every foot six toes four and twenty and
[1:29:48] number and he also was born
[1:29:51] to the Giant and when he defied Israel
[1:29:54] Jonathan the son of Samia the brother of
[1:29:58] David slew him
[1:30:00] these four were bored of the German
[1:30:02] death and fell by the hand of David and
[1:30:04] by the hand of his servants there's a
[1:30:07] new generation rose up the enemy had a
[1:30:10] new generation and God had a new
[1:30:13] generation but this new generation on
[1:30:15] God's side were up in the battle I mean
[1:30:19] because Jonathan was David's nephew here
[1:30:23] that's Jonathan they were in the battle
[1:30:27] they had confidence in their weapon amen
[1:30:30] and they overcame the enemy we have to
[1:30:33] be like this amen as families as a
[1:30:37] church we need to be like this we're the
[1:30:39] younger generation steps up hallelujah
[1:30:43] yes you say well you're putting pressure
[1:30:45] on me
[1:30:46] no the weapons good the weapons good it
[1:30:50] doesn't get blunt it'll find its target
[1:30:54] its amen that's why you have confidence
[1:30:57] in your equipment you know it's like an
[1:31:00] army that goes to battle with some old
[1:31:02] antiquated stuff the morale is not too
[1:31:05] good you can be trained to a certain
[1:31:08] level but if you're fighting with
[1:31:09] weapons from World War two in this
[1:31:11] modern era you're not gonna do so well
[1:31:13] so you gotta have the training but you
[1:31:15] have confidence in your weapon
[1:31:19] this is their well he said he had five
[1:31:23] stones this is now this is now long
[1:31:24] David fighting Goliath he had five
[1:31:27] stones GES us what wasn't thousand five
[1:31:31] fingers if a ith faith wrapped up in
[1:31:34] Jesus here he went brother I'm telling
[1:31:36] I'm telling it sent the rock to the
[1:31:39] killing place down went Goliath you know
[1:31:42] what happened then the Israelites took
[1:31:44] courage and a way they went
[1:31:45] they kept Philistines plumb to the walls
[1:31:47] it takes one person that's got enough
[1:31:50] courage to step out and say it's right
[1:31:52] and God said so amen brother
[1:31:55] yield down a Goliath your whole family
[1:31:57] will go to cut and Philistines the first
[1:31:59] thing you know what's that in your hand
[1:32:01] what can you do testify
[1:32:03] sing do something another on the job do
[1:32:06] something for the glory of God I've seen
[1:32:08] in the days of judges little fellow
[1:32:09] named Shem guy and it's found out in the
[1:32:12] days of judges all he had was an ox code
[1:32:14] it took one man to stand up and have
[1:32:17] courage be that one be that one he say
[1:32:25] well does that really work if someone
[1:32:27] stands up and says that's right God said
[1:32:28] so now I might get this testimony
[1:32:31] completely wrong but Christine was what
[1:32:34] about twenty years old in America in a
[1:32:36] convention brother Isaac was there and
[1:32:38] the pillar fly was moving and she said a
[1:32:41] little big war fighter to me God came
[1:32:43] down she's out speaking another language
[1:32:44] or joy sing and shouting dancing and
[1:32:47] then she comes back to New Zealand and
[1:32:49] they begin to pray there in Turanga and
[1:32:52] God came down and people Melanie
[1:32:54] received the Holy Ghost amen
[1:32:57] and they had a service and there was
[1:32:59] young people in that church and they see
[1:33:01] they didn't even believe in God anymore
[1:33:02] and God came down in a powerful way and
[1:33:05] now we've been given in a hostile God
[1:33:07] and it was a spiritual awakening because
[1:33:09] one person stood up said Lord be
[1:33:11] glorified in me and you know you'd be
[1:33:13] cutting Philistines to the walls
[1:33:16] hallelujah and that wasn't that long ago
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:22] stand up no it's it sir hallelujah what
[1:33:27] are the Philistines reface they're not
[1:33:29] people I mean this demon powers try to
[1:33:32] keep us down keep us down informality
[1:33:34] and all this just goodbye and the world
[1:33:36] is busy and you're busy you have no time
[1:33:38] I mean to find those full of stars
[1:33:41] hallelujah now I'm just going to finish
[1:33:51] with this
[1:33:54] season after the boldero came the musket
[1:33:57] and after the musket came the
[1:33:59] Springfield to leave reaction rifle and
[1:34:01] now the atomic weapons and things see we
[1:34:04] keep going growing more but God at the
[1:34:06] beginning gave his children the atomic
[1:34:08] weapon because he's the infinite God now
[1:34:11] seeing there's going to be a conflict
[1:34:13] and there is going to be a battle god
[1:34:15] equipped us children with the right kind
[1:34:17] of ammunition the right kind of attack
[1:34:20] the right kind of everything that they
[1:34:22] had need that would sweep them all all
[1:34:25] the way from Eden to the rapture I was
[1:34:30] blessed when I read that what was it the
[1:34:32] word the word that's what defeat Satan
[1:34:34] is the word it will defeat them anywhere
[1:34:37] any place anywhere any place not just
[1:34:42] here on your job driving down the road
[1:34:45] and the supermarket at home you're just
[1:34:48] going to have a bit of love amen and God
[1:34:51] loves you without looking for anything
[1:34:52] in return
[1:34:53] unconditional love and it should be the
[1:34:55] same thing with us we should look at our
[1:34:57] family and just love them pick is what
[1:35:01] they do love their you to think long
[1:35:02] term
[1:35:04] this world is an instant world my
[1:35:07] coffees not quick enough the microwave
[1:35:09] is too slow
[1:35:10] the internet the broadband is too slow
[1:35:13] point 2 of a second I can't wait to
[1:35:15] point to of a second I need to have my
[1:35:17] answer now God has long term you can't
[1:35:22] just do a you know it's like in a battle
[1:35:24] when two armies are fighting and one of
[1:35:28] them it's not the one who wins the
[1:35:29] battle is the one who wins the war they
[1:35:32] are the victors the ones who win the war
[1:35:36] not the battle you see it all through
[1:35:39] history the Japanese World War two they
[1:35:44] had a lot of success initially so did
[1:35:46] the Nazis they didn't win the war they
[1:35:49] won a lot of battles but they lost the
[1:35:50] war
[1:35:51] has to be the same thing with us you
[1:35:53] gotta think long-term long term yes I
[1:35:56] say love as if you're not looking for
[1:35:59] anything in return because then you're
[1:36:04] looking at conditions and you're looking
[1:36:05] at the promise now
[1:36:08] anyplace anywhere now why do we want to
[1:36:12] substitute something else when we're
[1:36:14] already got the best thing there is the
[1:36:16] word and we find Jesus on earth just to
[1:36:18] prove this was the best equipment when
[1:36:20] Satan came in hand-to-hand combat with
[1:36:22] Jesus he never reached over with his
[1:36:24] power and tied his hands he just took
[1:36:26] the same weapon that God I gave him the
[1:36:29] Garden of Eden his word he said it's
[1:36:30] written it's written and he punched him
[1:36:32] right out of the ring with it I mean
[1:36:35] that's right because it's God's best and
[1:36:37] look where it is it's not just for one
[1:36:41] or two in the church it's for every one
[1:36:44] of us hello every one of us do you fit
[1:36:47] in that category amen
[1:36:52] let's just I'll just read this off here
[1:36:55] because it's too small he says every
[1:36:58] believer in and and I'm gonna close with
[1:37:00] this with this court here he says every
[1:37:05] believer has a right to take this word
[1:37:06] and fight the enemy where ever you meet
[1:37:09] him anywhere you meet the enemy this
[1:37:11] word is what you have to use and Jesus
[1:37:14] proved it when he come so he equipped us
[1:37:16] children with the word for their
[1:37:17] protection against the enemy when the
[1:37:20] all-out warfare comes the battle set an
[1:37:22] array there's only one thing a real
[1:37:24] soldier can use a real Christian soldier
[1:37:26] that's thus saith the Lord walk right up
[1:37:29] there and meet the enemy with the
[1:37:30] assurance that nothing thousand may fall
[1:37:32] at your right side ten thousand left but
[1:37:35] it won't come no they just remember that
[1:37:38] God made this statement and give it to
