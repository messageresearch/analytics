[32:14] Lord and Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[32:18] God bless your friends you may have your
[32:19] seats tonight so yes that was my it was
[32:21] just uh yesterday that phrase kept
[32:24] coming into you know upon my heart
[32:25] according to the scriptures and I had to
[32:27] look it up and I found it in the
[32:28] scripture here that you know the it's
[32:31] it's very interesting you know if you do
[32:33] something according to something it's
[32:35] based upon that and that's where your
[32:36] Authority comes from so the Lord our
[32:39] lord Jesus dying and then raising again
[32:41] wasn't according to man's idea a man's
[32:43] opinion on what he felt like doing but
[32:45] it was according to the prophecy
[32:46] concerning his life and we know that
[32:49] everyone is living under a prophecy you
[32:51] know the world is living under prophecy
[32:53] and it's going to be fulfilled according
[32:54] to the scriptures uh our lord Jesus life
[32:57] was uh prophecy then it became
[32:59] manifested and it was all according to
[33:01] the scripture you know we um you know uh
[33:04] people have done studies and they've
[33:06] shown that our lord Jesus fulfilled over
[33:08] 300 prophecies in the days of his flesh
[33:11] all of his life was according to the
[33:13] scriptures he was born in Bethlehem
[33:14] according to the scriptures you know he
[33:16] would he'd be raised up in Nazareth so
[33:18] it'd be called a Nazarene according to
[33:20] the scriptures he'd have to go down to
[33:21] Egypt because it was would say in the
[33:23] scriptures out of you I've called my
[33:25] sons he'd have to go there then come
[33:26] back according to the scriptures you
[33:28] know he would he would raise the dead
[33:29] heal the sick let you heal the lepers
[33:31] all those things according to the
[33:33] scriptures he'd be the Lamb of God which
[33:34] would take away the sin of the world
[33:36] according to the scripture and we know
[33:38] that as his life was scripture fulfilled
[33:40] so our life is scripture fulfilled you
[33:42] know as brother bran would say as our
[33:44] lord Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament
[33:46] so the bride will fulfill the new so our
[33:48] lives uh should be according to the
[33:51] scriptures because we know that the
[33:53] anointing they were under that's the
[33:54] only thing that we can live by you look
[33:56] through church history you take the
[33:58] martyrs they were under the ox anointing
[34:00] they had to give themselves as beasts of
[34:02] sacrifice because that's the only way
[34:04] they could live is because they're under
[34:06] that kind of anointing they're glad they
[34:07] gave their lives under that great
[34:09] persecution they were under then then
[34:11] came the man anointing of you know you
[34:13] know of the Holy Ghost where Martin
[34:14] Luther and very smart educated men who
[34:16] knew multiple languages in the Greek and
[34:18] the Hebrew different things could
[34:19] translate the Bible because that was the
[34:21] anointing they were under combat the
[34:23] enemy and then now we've come down to
[34:25] this end time where we are under the
[34:27] eagle anointing and so if you're under
[34:29] that anointing you'll be above Church
[34:32] politics you'll be above family trouble
[34:34] you'll be able to look beyond the
[34:36] trouble that's going on in your life
[34:38] you'll be able to look Beyond National
[34:39] trouble international travel Regional
[34:42] trouble personal trouble you'll be able
[34:44] to look Beyond it and see from eternity
[34:46] to Eternity right so what that means is
[34:49] you can look at things according to the
[34:50] word and not look at how you see it I
[34:52] mean you won't look at it based on what
[34:54] you see in front of you but you'll take
[34:56] it back to the scripture it'll be
[34:57] according to the scriptures you know
[34:59] it's so amazing that every Parable every
[35:01] scripture pertains to today so every
[35:03] type and Shadow in the Old Testament is
[35:06] fulfilled in this day now we could take
[35:08] for example you know Jesus would tell
[35:09] many parables he'd tell about you know
[35:12] the prodigal son for example how you
[35:14] know their product you know their
[35:15] youngest son took his inheritance wasted
[35:18] it lived in a far country you know was
[35:20] in a pig pen so on but there was a
[35:22] believing father that prayed for his
[35:23] child and was determined that he would
[35:26] not be satisfied till that child
[35:27] returned now that's more than just a
[35:29] nice story but it was actually speaking
[35:31] of a people in the end time where that
[35:33] would happen to someone but they would
[35:34] have the faith that their child's coming
[35:36] home right away with family whoever it
[35:38] may be amen is just like the same thing
[35:41] with the parable of the woman with the
[35:42] Lost coin you know we know in uh in
[35:45] Israel you know they had 10 10 coins in
[35:47] their in their headdress and that
[35:48] represented them being married it was
[35:50] like a reading wedding ring I'm just
[35:52] going to go into the slow laner but I
[35:53] feel like I'm going too fast you know
[35:55] it showed their marriage it was like a
[35:57] wedding band on our hand it was the same
[35:59] with the coins now she lost one of those
[36:01] coins she lost part of her identity and
[36:03] so her husband was coming back instead
[36:05] of her just facing you know she she was
[36:07] determined because she knew she lost it
[36:09] somewhere so she began to sweep the
[36:11] house to find that lost coin and she
[36:13] only rested when she found that lost
[36:15] part of her identity that's the same
[36:18] thing with you and I we're United to the
[36:19] word but the devil can come in and steal
[36:21] our joy steal our peace steal our love
[36:23] whatever it may be but there'll be a
[36:25] people in the end time will be
[36:27] determined I'm not living without that
[36:29] lost part of myself just like she was so
[36:31] we could see all these Parables pertain
[36:34] to us in this day amen you know the two
[36:37] on the way to Emmaus were living in
[36:38] fulfilled prophecy they had just seen
[36:41] many prophecies fulfilled in the last
[36:42] hours of Jesus life and they were
[36:45] broken-hearted you know their Messiah
[36:47] you know their Prophet you know you know
[36:48] they believed he was a mighty Prophet
[36:50] had been crucified the ministry had
[36:52] locked themselves away in the upper room
[36:54] Judas the church treasure he came
[36:55] committed suicide their whole church
[36:58] movement had fallen apart and they are
[37:00] walking back to Emmaus the village with
[37:02] our from and and then but a stranger
[37:05] joined them
[37:06] and it says in Luke 24 it was actually
[37:08] Jesus but the Bible says that they could
[37:11] not see him because they could not
[37:12] identify him because their eyes wrecked
[37:14] it was hidden to them but here he was
[37:16] the resurrected Christ was walking with
[37:18] two of his disciples and they would he
[37:21] would begin to ask them you know what's
[37:23] going on what's Happening and they were
[37:25] surprised what do you mean what things
[37:26] that are happening are you have you just
[37:28] crawled out from under a rock or you
[37:29] know how do you not know what's going on
[37:31] the whole city's been in an uproar and
[37:33] many things have happened great
[37:35] discussions you know and then they would
[37:36] try and film they would they would fill
[37:39] this Stranger in into what was going on
[37:41] but they didn't realize that the one who
[37:42] fulfilled all those prophecies was
[37:44] walking with them and then so they were
[37:47] I mean so he would say to them oh fools
[37:49] and slow pardon is and then he had
[37:51] started Moses and then start from Moses
[37:54] go all the way through the scriptures
[37:55] everything that he fulfilled brother
[37:57] Brown um condenses here in modern events
[38:00] May clear by prophecy he says let's just
[38:02] go back a few minutes and now let's
[38:03] listen to the words quoted from himself
[38:06] watch here the word itself quoting the
[38:08] word of himself the word itself quoting
[38:11] the word of himself not to tell them
[38:12] that he was that but just let the word
[38:15] speak for itself then they know who he
[38:17] was the letter of the word quoting the
[38:19] word the word and flesh quoting the word
[38:20] of the letter being fully identified
[38:22] with him look here now let's listen to
[38:24] him quote now now we know
[38:27] that they were all briefed of the late
[38:29] happenings that is of the crucifixion of
[38:31] the story of the Resurrection the tomb
[38:33] as we just read now he goes straight to
[38:35] the word of the prophecy about himself
[38:37] now let's just think what he's uh that
[38:40] he said this he said a lot more than
[38:41] this but watch because remember he he
[38:43] spoke them for six hours as they're
[38:45] walking to a mass now uh let's say him
[38:48] hear him say turn over to Zechariah 11
[38:50] and 12 and wasn't the Messiah to be sold
[38:52] according to the prophet for 30 pieces
[38:54] of silver you just said that this man
[38:56] was sold for 30 piece of silver turnover
[38:58] you're getting them scriptures Zechariah
[39:00] 11 and 12. then he said did you notice
[39:02] that David said in the psalm Psalms 14 1
[39:05] and 9 he is to be betrayed by his
[39:08] friends and then again in Zechariah 13
[39:09] and 7 he was forsaken by his disciples
[39:12] and in Psalms 35 11 Accused by false
[39:14] witnesses as you just said he was Isaiah
[39:17] 53 and 7. he was done before his
[39:19] accusers Isaiah 50 and 6 they scorched
[39:21] him the prophet said in Psalms 22 he was
[39:24] to cry on the cross my God my God why is
[39:26] our forsaken me did he do that day
[39:28] before yesterday afternoon Psalms 22
[39:31] again 18 His Garment was parted among
[39:33] them did they do that and Psalms 22 7-8
[39:37] mocked by his enemies the church psalms
[39:39] 22 again there was not to be a bone of
[39:41] his body broke and they but they pierced
[39:43] my hands and my feet he said holding his
[39:45] hands behind him no doubt at the time
[39:46] Isaiah 53 and 12 and he said he would
[39:49] die between male factors Isaiah 53 and 9
[39:52] said he's used to be buried with the
[39:53] rich psalm 16 and 10 said I'll not leave
[39:56] us soul and Hell neither will I suffer
[39:57] my Holy One to see corruption and was
[40:00] not Malachi 3 the Forerunner of this man
[40:02] oh I'd like to have heard him quote that
[40:04] look at the prophecies notice
[40:06] then all the types he might have gone
[40:08] through about Isaac in Genesis 22 and
[40:10] God foreshadowed isakower his father
[40:12] Abraham took his own son packing the
[40:13] wood up the hill and offered up his own
[40:15] son it was now beginning to soak into
[40:18] them he had done told them that they
[40:20] were fools for not looking at the
[40:21] prophecy for that day and now it began
[40:24] to soak in begin to see the fulfilling
[40:26] of all this that had taken place in the
[40:28] last days the last two or three years
[40:30] The Vindicator Prophecy of the age it
[40:33] was then that they knew that their
[40:34] crucified friend Jesus had fulfilled
[40:37] every word of this oh it was then that
[40:40] they know that that man truly was that
[40:41] Messiah that he should raise from the
[40:45] dead I love that when he's asking me
[40:46] questions did he do that did they do
[40:49] that and we can bring It Forward into
[40:50] this day didn't the scriptures say that
[40:53] Malachi 4 would be the Forerunner of
[40:54] this you know you know of the word of
[40:57] the second coming of Christ amen was not
[40:59] brother Bram given to signs one would be
[41:01] in the hand and the other bit of
[41:03] discernment of the heart did that happen
[41:05] right then he say an angel meet him in a
[41:07] cave and you know it's one thing to say
[41:08] an angel met you it's nothing for that
[41:10] angel to come down night after night
[41:11] meeting after meeting in front of
[41:13] thousands and thousands of people and
[41:15] prove himself did that happen yes amen
[41:17] did exactly you know to the cloud a pair
[41:20] of a sunset Mountain the Seven Seals
[41:22] come open did that happen right now has
[41:24] a bride risen up in power and Faith
[41:26] how's that happen right has the word put
[41:28] on flesh again has that happened right
[41:30] so we can see now that that the day we
[41:33] live in is according to the scripture we
[41:34] can see in Revelation 3 that we would be
[41:37] rich and increase with Goods is that not
[41:38] the age we live in well but also say to
[41:41] be blind naked miserable wretched and
[41:42] don't know it
[41:44] right so we can see that if if all this
[41:47] prophecy is being fulfilled that's right
[41:49] then the end result of that prophecy is
[41:51] going to be fulfilled as well no we've
[41:53] got to understand that when you know
[41:55] when Jesus Jesus would stand in the
[41:58] synagogue now it's one thing to talk
[41:59] about prophecy it's nothing to declare
[42:01] it's been fulfilled to talk about
[42:03] prophecy there's no controversy in
[42:05] talking about it no doubt the rabbis and
[42:08] the scribes and the Pharisees they would
[42:09] talk about prophecy all the day long but
[42:12] then a Man From Galilee stood up in the
[42:13] synagogue one day and he turned to
[42:15] Isaiah and he found you know Isaiah 61
[42:18] and he began to read that portion of
[42:20] scripture says that the spirit of the
[42:22] Lord is upon me prayer sent me to to
[42:24] Open the Eyes of the blind said at
[42:25] Liberty those that kept of your heal
[42:27] those that are bruised to preach the
[42:28] except for the year of the Lord and then
[42:30] he would read that and then he'd say
[42:32] this day is this scripture fulfilled now
[42:35] you would expect all that congregation
[42:37] to stand up give glory to God and praise
[42:40] His holy name that he God had visited
[42:43] them in their hour and had fulfilled the
[42:45] prophecy no doubt they would have read
[42:46] that prophecy and said isn't that gonna
[42:48] be amazing when it's fulfilled and they
[42:50] would have got excited about that but
[42:52] when a man stood there and said this day
[42:54] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[42:57] they got angry hey when you're even
[43:00] neutral about it they got angry they're
[43:02] gonna throw them down a hill throw them
[43:03] down a bluff they they took them out of
[43:05] town they're going to throw them down a
[43:06] bluff but he but he walked his way out
[43:08] from among them so you see the
[43:10] controversy is never talking about the
[43:12] prophecy the controversy is always in
[43:14] the Fulfillment of the prophecy why was
[43:17] Jesus so controversial in his day
[43:19] because he said I am the Messiah I am
[43:22] the Fulfillment of everything you've
[43:24] been looking for here I am
[43:26] and yet all his life was according to
[43:29] the scriptures you know we watched um
[43:30] Sight and Sound did a did a play on the
[43:33] life of Jesus that's good I think it's
[43:36] good but there's um there's a
[43:39] um Nicodemus and there's Joseph of
[43:41] arathea they're you know their Pharisees
[43:43] in the play Nicodemus especially but
[43:45] then they begin to Nicodemus when when
[43:47] Jesus would do something hit he'd pull
[43:48] out a scroll out of his bow to be a
[43:50] prophecy he'd read it and say
[43:53] he just did that you know he'd do this
[43:55] and you know come in on the donkey there
[43:57] you're into Jerusalem though crying
[43:58] Hosanna and then hits had a um he'd say
[44:02] to uh Joseph that's what Zechariah said
[44:05] would happen behold your king comes unto
[44:06] your Zone on a you know on a donkey you
[44:09] know and then and then when Jesus hang
[44:11] on the cross crying out my God my God
[44:13] why is have forsaken me Nicodemus would
[44:15] pick up the scroll and say look this is
[44:16] in the Psalms you know so they were
[44:19] actually seeing the word being fulfilled
[44:21] they could look beyond what they see
[44:23] with their eyes God would give a special
[44:26] Grace to a people that they could see
[44:28] what they see in front of them is the
[44:30] Fulfillment of scripture now it takes
[44:32] the Sovereign Grace of God to open
[44:34] people's eyes you know it's not it's not
[44:36] an intellect that can open the eyes of
[44:38] the blind the spiritual eyes to give an
[44:40] understanding it's God that will do that
[44:42] it's only God that can do that now it's
[44:45] so vitally important that we can see
[44:47] fulfilled scripture in this day and we
[44:50] need to look at our own lives as
[44:51] scripture being fulfilled amen so you
[44:54] know we can look at Jesus life and say
[44:56] yes it was all according to the
[44:57] scriptures
[44:58] and then we can even look at brother
[45:00] Brown's Ministry and say yes it was
[45:02] according to the scripture where where
[45:04] the Lord Jesus promised that in this day
[45:07] as it was in the days of Noah as it was
[45:09] days of lot so you'll see the revealing
[45:12] of the son of man
[45:14] and we have seen a Ministry in the South
[45:16] I know this is nothing new to you but
[45:17] you know we've seen a Ministry in the
[45:19] South the same Ministry that Jesus had
[45:21] has come down into redeemed son and he's
[45:24] revealed himself in the same way like he
[45:26] revealed the secrets and hearts of you
[45:28] know the woman at the well Nathaniel
[45:29] under the tree all those different ones
[45:31] you know the scripture says in many you
[45:33] know many places in the gospel says and
[45:34] he knew their thoughts and that happened
[45:36] in front of thousands of thousands of
[45:37] people down to their address and what
[45:40] they're wearing at the time with us
[45:41] sitting when they're praying different
[45:42] amazing credible details
[45:45] that was all done out in the open so
[45:48] we've seen this happen
[45:50] that's right amen amen but then also the
[45:52] son of man would be revealed not just in
[45:54] one man but in a multi-membered body
[45:57] right so that same son of man that same
[45:59] Lord Jesus Christ comes into a
[46:01] multi-membered body Rachel was just in
[46:04] one man and a prophet but now that same
[46:05] Holy Ghost and the people around the
[46:07] world
[46:08] right doing living the same word out
[46:11] brother man was saying for someone who's
[46:13] fully surrendered to God then the
[46:15] thoughts and thoughts and tenses of the
[46:17] heart will be discerned through that
[46:19] person the word will put on flesh in
[46:21] that same way
[46:22] anyway amen but all these things are
[46:25] according to the scripture now we look
[46:27] at our own lives we're where the
[46:30] scripture would say the marriage of the
[46:32] Lamb has come this is Revelations 19 and
[46:34] his wife has made herself ready and it
[46:37] was granted unto her that should be a
[46:38] raid and final and clean and white which
[46:40] is the righteousness of the Saints now
[46:42] once upon a time that was a prophecy but
[46:45] now it is a reality right now it is
[46:48] happening amen if you have truly have
[46:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've
[46:53] been a raid in the wedding garment that
[46:55] is your winning government that you know
[46:56] the word is put on flesh in you you yeah
[46:58] because it's great it says enter her was
[47:00] granted so basically the Lord says
[47:03] here's my wardrobe here's the wedding
[47:05] garment put it on he said oh it fits me
[47:07] just right Hallelujah come to find out
[47:10] the word Fitzy just right but to see all
[47:12] this is done according to the scriptures
[47:14] just like we get baptized in the name of
[47:16] the Lord Jesus Christ according to the
[47:18] scriptures because you shall receive the
[47:19] gift of the Holy Ghost according to the
[47:21] scriptures and that means that when you
[47:23] when you receive the Holy Ghost you can
[47:25] see your life in the Bible right you can
[47:28] look through any type of shadow of a
[47:29] Believer and you can identify with that
[47:31] same one because that same spirit that
[47:33] was in them is in you amen and you can
[47:35] see a book of Acts written behind your
[47:37] life
[47:38] praise the Lord amen now we had a
[47:41] promise when we first started this
[47:42] church that we you know we had a prayer
[47:44] meeting up at brother Andy's place and
[47:46] we had a Tang's interpretation says if
[47:47] you remain humble my word will continue
[47:50] to go forth and I will bring my people
[47:52] here and they shall find my rest now the
[47:56] rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:57] now that was a promise we had in the
[47:59] very beginning now I do not believe
[48:06] God has never stood up and said I
[48:08] finished with that promise no that
[48:10] promise is still here you say well I
[48:12] need that in the scripture well I'll
[48:13] give it to you in the scripture God
[48:15] resists the proud but gives grace to the
[48:17] humble
[48:18] right sometimes he'll give grace to you
[48:21] for someone else right that's why if we
[48:23] remain humble he giveth grace to the
[48:25] humble right that when people come here
[48:27] they'll get that same Grace the baptism
[48:29] of the Holy Ghost so I don't see
[48:31] anywhere where that promise will stop
[48:33] until the change of the body right so
[48:35] now we've got to be we're going to be
[48:37] under expectation where people come and
[48:39] they just kind of wander in and wander
[48:41] around and they haven't really met the
[48:42] Lord yet we'll say no no the promise
[48:44] here is that they should meet God
[48:46] right the people shouldn't just be
[48:48] halfway in and just gather around
[48:49] because a nice group of people the
[48:51] food's good whatever they're you know
[48:53] tick box says it's happy you know no but
[48:55] they should they should meet the Lord
[48:57] amen so we should be really deadly
[49:00] sincere Lord we want to be humble now
[49:03] your word will go forth that God will
[49:05] speak that God will listen that God
[49:07] walked into someone's address and speak
[49:09] to them about what they've been speaking
[49:11] to people about or what they've been
[49:12] thinking about and that will cause
[49:14] people to surrender their lives over and
[49:16] they will meet the same Jesus that we
[49:18] know
[49:19] amen but we've got to realize that if we
[49:21] if we want to take more ground the enemy
[49:23] is going to try and push us back yeah
[49:25] yeah you know I was talking to Ben about
[49:26] this the other day you know what struck
[49:28] me about the Gallipoli um exhibit there
[49:30] in um te Papa well many things did but
[49:32] one thing is is they show a
[49:34] three-dimensional map of of where where
[49:37] they fought and they showed the timeline
[49:39] of how far the anzacs would advance and
[49:41] you know of course every time I Advance
[49:43] the Turks would try and push them back
[49:44] there's always a counter-attack would
[49:46] come and that's how it happens in war
[49:47] You Know The Enemy advances you know we
[49:50] may advance or the enemy May Advance the
[49:52] other side is not just going to let them
[49:53] Advance they're going to try and push
[49:54] them off the ground they have just
[49:56] gained as the same thing with you and I
[49:58] we're beginning to grow on the Lord
[49:59] we're going to take our positions you
[50:01] know we yeah we look at Promises of you
[50:03] know of your healing of restoration of
[50:06] faith of joy of the baptism of the Holy
[50:08] Ghost the gifts of the Spirit whatever
[50:10] it may be the devil doesn't want us to
[50:12] possess those promises you know we have
[50:14] a good meeting you have a good time of
[50:15] prayer you enjoy the word what's that
[50:17] that's you gaining ground the devil
[50:19] doesn't want you to hold that ground he
[50:20] wants to push you back maybe with
[50:22] discouragement maybe maybe with pride or
[50:24] jail policy or insecurity something will
[50:26] come and try and push you off that
[50:28] ground you've just gained I say it's
[50:30] time we don't get pushed back no more I
[50:32] say let's take every bit of Grant and
[50:34] let's keep advancing and if the enemy is
[50:36] counter-attacking we should expect them
[50:38] to do it amen because we're in a battle
[50:41] right but so we should be ready for the
[50:43] counter attack
[50:44] hey man that's why it's so important to
[50:46] hold that Shield of Faith which quenches
[50:48] the fiery darts of the enemy remember
[50:50] the devil doesn't physically stand there
[50:52] and fire fire it out to you no but he'll
[50:55] anoint someone or something to happen to
[50:56] to say something and that can be a fiery
[50:59] Dart now if that if you don't hold up
[51:01] that Shield of Faith how do you hold the
[51:03] shield of Faith up well you give the
[51:05] benefit of the doubt or you don't take
[51:07] it to heart you say father forgive them
[51:09] they don't know what they do or they
[51:10] didn't really mean that if they're
[51:12] really in a good space they wouldn't
[51:13] really mean that you're they're my
[51:15] brother or sister their family whatever
[51:16] it was that's holding up the shield of
[51:18] Faith right but if you load that Shield
[51:21] of faith and take it kindly well that's
[51:22] going to push you back but we've come to
[51:24] a place I I think we've come to a place
[51:27] where let's not be pushed back no more
[51:30] let's advance
[51:32] according to the scripture you know as
[51:35] brother Isaac stood here and preached
[51:36] you from Jordan to the Sea we're going
[51:39] to take the whole promise of God we're
[51:40] going to take every promises in the book
[51:42] there's gonna be ours amen it's going to
[51:44] be ours doesn't matter how much the
[51:46] opposition how much call for Melody may
[51:48] come in or some argument you know a real
[51:51] testimony is never
[51:53] is never underneath an argument an
[51:57] argument never beats a testimony amen
[51:59] amen right yeah describes and Pharisees
[52:02] couldn't stand it that a man that was
[52:04] born blind was healed by the Lord
[52:06] you know here's a guy born blind and you
[52:09] know the disciples asked the question it
[52:11] wasn't him or his parents sin do you
[52:13] know why is this judgment come upon him
[52:14] how how interesting it is people want to
[52:16] think well it must be judgment
[52:18] you know just like job's friends we
[52:20] don't want to be job's friend we want to
[52:21] be his real friends and actually share
[52:23] with a real God right we don't want to
[52:24] be job's friends like they were in the
[52:26] Bible we understand but so but he said
[52:28] neither but the glory of God would be
[52:29] done and so here's this man Jesus heals
[52:32] him he comes back in he's rejoicing his
[52:34] parents are there and you know and then
[52:36] and then I don't know if it was I don't
[52:38] know what Pharisees said and he said you
[52:39] know we know this Jesus you know he said
[52:41] give glory to God we know this Jesus is
[52:44] a sinner
[52:45] you know and the and the guy who used to
[52:47] be blind said well one thing I don't
[52:48] know if he's a sinner or not but one
[52:50] thing I know I was blind but now I see
[52:51] this has never been done in all of
[52:54] history a person born blind has been
[52:56] restored their sight so an argument can
[52:58] come along this is wrong this message is
[52:59] false blah blah blah but if you've
[53:01] really met the resurrected Lord Jesus
[53:03] Christ that stuff don't mean nothing
[53:05] because all he can be just like the
[53:07] blind man all I know is I came in
[53:09] contact with this word to transformed my
[53:11] life and I don't want to go back and be
[53:13] blind no more
[53:15] stay sing thank you very much
[53:17] Hallelujah so
[53:19] amen so now according to the scriptures
[53:22] this is who we are going to be
[53:24] a woman of Faith you look at the New
[53:26] Testament
[53:27] I mean the Bride is a woman of faith
[53:29] amen amen she's a woman of Faith as
[53:32] Sarah had a visitation you know it's
[53:34] amazing how you think about Luke 17 30
[53:36] in the days of lot so shall be when the
[53:38] son of man is revealed in the days of
[53:40] Lord is when when Abraham and Moses had
[53:42] their visitation by God himself
[53:45] and so it's incredible when you think
[53:47] about it where we can actually entertain
[53:48] angels unawares as as the Bible says now
[53:52] sometimes they can be in a physical form
[53:54] they can look like an ordinary person
[53:56] but sometimes the word can come and
[53:58] anointing of God can come and we can
[54:00] entertain God next to be unaware of who
[54:02] we're enjoying actually many times we
[54:04] will entertain demons unawares
[54:07] because thoughts come negative thoughts
[54:09] negative feelings you know distance
[54:11] between people malice or strife and you
[54:14] you just be stewing on something that
[54:15] doesn't mean anything what are you doing
[54:17] you're entertaining a devil
[54:23] hold on who am I talking to amen where
[54:26] am I having a conversation who's on the
[54:28] other end of the phone
[54:29] you know and you come to yourself and
[54:31] realize no that's not of God
[54:33] that's not of God you know a couple of
[54:36] the days ago I just thought Pat in my
[54:38] mind you know God doesn't hear my
[54:39] prayers he's distant somewhere he
[54:41] doesn't hear you your prayers are in
[54:43] vain you know I think it actually make
[54:44] it into meditate on that didn't make me
[54:47] feel happy one bit but then I began to
[54:49] think no the scripture says that his
[54:50] blood is broken down every middle wall
[54:52] of partition he has brought me now he
[54:54] said I'll never leave enough forsake
[54:56] thee his blood puts me off speaking
[54:57] terms with him and that thought just
[54:59] vanished right but I was entertaining
[55:02] the wrong thing yes
[55:04] amen but that's why we should we said
[55:06] Lord I want to be entertaining you even
[55:08] unawares but eventually I'll come to
[55:09] recognition just like Sarah she didn't
[55:12] realize that one of the well there's two
[55:14] angels it was God and flesh sitting in
[55:16] the tent outside of her you know she has
[55:19] an attempt inside they were outside
[55:21] she was entertaining God himself and she
[55:24] didn't really realize it
[55:26] but there came a time when she realized
[55:28] it
[55:29] yes amen so we want to have an
[55:31] atmosphere around us
[55:33] they were Entertaining Angels and it's
[55:36] not unawares where sweet humble feeling
[55:38] Cuts sweeps over you Faith begins to
[55:41] rise what's that angel steps into your
[55:43] house
[55:44] Hallelujah we want to entertain that
[55:46] stay you can't leave
[55:48] I don't know how to lock the door and
[55:49] keep you in but but don't go
[55:52] don't you want to have that kind of
[55:53] atmosphere then the Lord steps into the
[55:55] house
[55:56] Holly you have a prayer meeting just
[55:57] talk about and be washing dishes
[55:59] vacuuming whatever you may be doing just
[56:01] that anointing the atmosphere just
[56:02] changes
[56:03] Hallelujah I believe we can have those
[56:06] kind of times
[56:07] I'm amen so you know we've got to be
[56:09] very aware like because because the New
[56:11] Testament has actually more visitations
[56:13] of angels than the old and we still live
[56:15] in the New Testament era amen
[56:18] amen so we're going to look at our lives
[56:20] as it is according to the scriptures now
[56:22] as Jesus said to his disciples as the
[56:25] father sent me so send are you so it
[56:27] wasn't a church that sent them it wasn't
[56:29] the Sanhedrin or a group of people it
[56:31] wasn't even themselves that sent them
[56:32] but God sent them amen right and it's
[56:34] the same thing with you and I as as the
[56:37] prophet was sent by God so God sends you
[56:39] and I so that means all of Heaven is
[56:42] behind you right you are not the embassy
[56:46] of yourself
[56:47] like a like a diplomatic call right we
[56:49] have embassies in Wellington here
[56:51] there's the Russian Embassy there's the
[56:53] Australian embassies there's the
[56:54] American Embassy Chinese all of them in
[56:56] there that have diplomatic relations
[56:58] with this country
[57:00] right so all of that country stands
[57:02] behind that Diplomat or that Ambassador
[57:05] all they ask all the glory or whatever
[57:07] all the Armed Forces whatever is in that
[57:10] country I mean is actually being
[57:12] represented by that person who is the
[57:15] ambassador so now we are not backed by a
[57:18] natural country
[57:19] right we are back by Heaven All That
[57:22] Heaven is is behind you and I we become
[57:24] ambassadors of Heaven amen just as all
[57:28] of you know Jesus said you know
[57:30] don't you think that I could call my
[57:31] father hits in 12 Legions of angels I
[57:33] think it was he said that's you know if
[57:36] you break down the numbers that's
[57:37] thousands and thousands of angels He
[57:39] just Winkle give the nun or whatever
[57:41] that all be there and they would have
[57:44] turned the whole place upside down even
[57:45] one would turn the whole place upside
[57:46] down why because he was he was God made
[57:49] flesh but all heaven was was behind him
[57:51] now if we are the bride of Christ which
[57:54] we are I believe according to the
[57:56] scriptures amen then all of Heaven is
[57:58] behind us so if all of Heaven is behind
[58:01] us why should we settle for second best
[58:03] against the devil why should we put up
[58:06] with his lies as slander his doubts you
[58:09] know his worries his fears we shouldn't
[58:11] put up with none of it amen we should
[58:14] just take God at his word because we've
[58:16] got to realize that God does the
[58:18] impossible I don't know if you've really
[58:20] come to that conclusion But as God does
[58:22] what we think is impossible I mean Jonah
[58:24] was in the belly of a whale you think it
[58:27] was a prepared phrase the Bible said you
[58:28] think it's physically possible for them
[58:31] to get out of that well I don't know how
[58:33] deep that well went down into the dips
[58:35] but even if it even if it opened its
[58:36] mouth up there and vomited Jonah out in
[58:39] the bottom of the sea he would have died
[58:41] right he couldn't physically get out
[58:43] there was no Escape at your emergency
[58:45] door open to get out of that fish right
[58:47] but the Lord anointed that well because
[58:50] Jonah and Faith said oh look once more
[58:52] to your Holy Temple right and he went up
[58:54] to the service and sped him out upon the
[58:56] bank so that seemed to be an impossible
[58:59] situation
[59:00] amen Elijah would stand on Mount Carmel
[59:03] now humanly it was impossible to bring
[59:05] fire yeah but he did he said when he
[59:08] prepared the altar he prepared the wood
[59:10] the sacrifice had the water poured upon
[59:12] it when he prayed he said Lord I have
[59:14] done all this according to Thy word so
[59:17] he did it all according to the scripture
[59:19] right it was a vision he walked
[59:21] according to the vision and it happened
[59:22] but God did a supernatural Victory
[59:26] because why he did it all according to
[59:28] the scripture and if you stand for God's
[59:30] word God will stand for you amen God
[59:33] will stand for you so you've got to
[59:34] realize that God is behind us we can be
[59:36] the weakest part of the church it
[59:38] doesn't matter God said he will bear us
[59:40] like a father does as young right so
[59:43] he's not going to leave us behind if we
[59:44] feel we can't keep up God will slow the
[59:46] whole program down to get us there
[59:48] Hallelujah because he's determined that
[59:50] we're gonna get there so you look at the
[59:52] impossible situations of Israel by the
[59:54] Red Sea they couldn't cross the Red Sea
[59:57] but God opened the Red Sea for them to
[59:58] walk over on dry land yeah now God does
[1:00:01] the impossible
[1:00:02] Lazarus was four days in the grave his
[1:00:05] body was already rotting they didn't
[1:00:07] bomb people like we do these days is it
[1:00:09] a hot country
[1:00:11] his nose begin the cavinary brain was
[1:00:14] already decaying but yet the
[1:00:16] resurrection of Life came to his tomb
[1:00:18] that's why we can physically look
[1:00:19] because remember they said to him Lord
[1:00:21] buddy stinketh he's already gone beyond
[1:00:24] he's gone beyond hope maybe maybe they
[1:00:27] even begin to think well he just died
[1:00:29] but the law can raise him again because
[1:00:30] we've seen him go past the funeral
[1:00:32] procession and then the boy came to life
[1:00:34] or driest daughter that freshly died but
[1:00:36] then she came to life again so maybe
[1:00:38] they had a little bit of Hope Mary would
[1:00:39] Santa Martha don't weep it's gonna be
[1:00:41] okay Jesus will get here before he
[1:00:43] begins to rot but then the first day
[1:00:45] went then the second day went
[1:00:47] than the third day yeah yeah and that
[1:00:50] was day number four
[1:00:51] and maybe their hearts your sunk think
[1:00:53] it's too late
[1:00:55] but when God when there's a difference
[1:00:57] between us saying too late and God
[1:00:59] saying too late right and we want to
[1:01:01] stick on that When God says right even
[1:01:04] with the Lazarus was four days in the
[1:01:05] grave rotting already God said I'm on
[1:01:08] time
[1:01:09] I'm right on time you may think it's
[1:01:11] good because they've said Lord if you'd
[1:01:13] only been here us our our brother would
[1:01:15] not have died
[1:01:16] but don't you know I'm the resurrection
[1:01:18] of the life leave us thou this and they
[1:01:20] said yay Lord we believe
[1:01:22] Hallelujah
[1:01:24] so God does the impossible Peter was in
[1:01:27] the inner prison
[1:01:28] he was in the inner prison he wasn't
[1:01:29] just in the outer prison he was in
[1:01:31] maximum maximum security he had he had
[1:01:34] God's chain to either side of him he was
[1:01:37] in a prison now he was a Spirit-filled
[1:01:39] Holy Ghost filled man right but he was
[1:01:41] in a prison and there he was stuck but
[1:01:44] God allowed it in such a way that an
[1:01:46] angel came to him he thought it was a
[1:01:48] dream smote him on the side the chains
[1:01:50] fell off told him to get dressed put on
[1:01:52] his shoes Hallelujah and God took him
[1:01:55] out of the prison
[1:01:57] on it I mean so there's nothing you say
[1:01:59] well this this person is Chained in a
[1:02:01] prison of complex as an unbelief and
[1:02:03] pain and hurt and there's no prison too
[1:02:05] big no mental condition too big there is
[1:02:08] no impossible situation with God
[1:02:10] that's true Hallelujah according to the
[1:02:13] scripture Legion had a thousand demons
[1:02:15] in him you think he's gone too far
[1:02:18] no but Jesus said we're gonna cross
[1:02:20] because he knew Legion was there he went
[1:02:23] to find Legion amen so according to the
[1:02:26] scriptures there's no case too difficult
[1:02:28] for God police we need to start them and
[1:02:32] and I'm not saying that you don't
[1:02:33] believe a lot of this but we need to
[1:02:34] believe for the impossible like never
[1:02:37] before because this is the age where
[1:02:40] impossibilities become fulfilled amen
[1:02:43] where it's no longer impossible but it
[1:02:45] is possible and it is done
[1:02:48] Hallelujah brother Brown would would be
[1:02:50] brought a woman that many men had to
[1:02:52] because she was in a straight jacket
[1:02:54] mental institution had to be brought
[1:02:56] into the meeting into a room and she was
[1:02:58] slithering on the ground like a snake as
[1:03:00] man's voice was speaking out of her very
[1:03:03] strong broke out the windows in the car
[1:03:04] all these different things
[1:03:06] you'd think it's impossible for her to
[1:03:07] ever to come back to her right mind and
[1:03:10] their voice it'd have nothing to do to
[1:03:11] do with me William Branham I've got
[1:03:13] nothing to do with you and he just
[1:03:15] prayed for her and they and nothing
[1:03:17] seemed to happen then then they said
[1:03:19] what you doing there take her back three
[1:03:21] days later she was found saying normal
[1:03:23] she got released
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] so that's the same God as today
[1:03:29] amen we've seen demons cast out we've
[1:03:33] seen the Holy Ghost fill people amen
[1:03:35] we've seen healings take place we've
[1:03:37] seen people go from Lost to found amen
[1:03:39] we've seen God do the impossible in our
[1:03:41] midst so so I believe we should rally
[1:03:45] like never before that if we remain
[1:03:47] humble that his word will continue to go
[1:03:49] forth this is what I'm praying for camp
[1:03:51] and he will bring there's been people
[1:03:53] coming to campus never come before don't
[1:03:56] know their background don't know where
[1:03:58] they're from but they're coming
[1:03:59] amen and I believe they're coming
[1:04:01] because they'll find rest they'll meet
[1:04:04] God at Camp that's what I'm believing
[1:04:06] for amen because that promise is still
[1:04:09] being fulfilled
[1:04:11] Hallelujah why amen because I believe
[1:04:14] it's according it's according to the
[1:04:17] scriptures
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:19] when we take the rapture
[1:04:22] we can say well that was all according
[1:04:24] to the scriptures
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:28] Hallelujah
[1:04:30] every promise is for today
[1:04:32] every promise in the word is for today
[1:04:34] it's not for yesterday or tomorrow it's
[1:04:37] for right now he is the god of the
[1:04:39] impossible you say well I've been
[1:04:41] praying for saying for years just hold
[1:04:42] on if it's according to the scripture
[1:04:44] hold on for the promise amen then one
[1:04:47] day Faith will drop in it'll be a
[1:04:48] revelation then it's going to happen
[1:04:50] amen we should never ever look at a
[1:04:53] promise of God and say no we cannot have
[1:04:55] that because Jesus when he died on
[1:04:57] Calvary he died to purchase every
[1:04:59] promise for your name every Divine
[1:05:01] promise becomes our divine right you
[1:05:04] know in this hour this people are
[1:05:05] standing up for their rights it doesn't
[1:05:07] matter how absurd they may be to the
[1:05:09] same mind they're standing up for their
[1:05:10] rights how much more now the Bride of
[1:05:13] Jesus Christ we should stand up for our
[1:05:15] god-given rights amen we have the right
[1:05:18] for God to move in our services we have
[1:05:20] a right for the gifts of the Spirit we
[1:05:22] have right for Joy we're right for peace
[1:05:24] we have a right for divine love to be
[1:05:26] manifested amen we have a right for the
[1:05:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost we have a
[1:05:30] right for healing and for deliverance
[1:05:31] everywhere to pray what we think is
[1:05:34] impossible and God does the impossible
[1:05:35] amen we have a right but not because we
[1:05:38] are anything in ourselves remember this
[1:05:40] is not a reward program you know like
[1:05:43] you buy 10 coffees oh you buy nine
[1:05:45] coffees get the ten free it doesn't work
[1:05:47] like that with God right this is not a
[1:05:49] Rewards program as Jesus Paid It all he
[1:05:53] gave it to you and I we accept it and
[1:05:55] believe it and then be under expectation
[1:05:57] it's going to happen
[1:05:58] right this is not a reward it's not like
[1:06:00] Lord I listen to all these messages now
[1:06:02] and I've prayed this long so therefore
[1:06:04] I've earned her I've earned her healing
[1:06:06] somewhere
[1:06:06] it doesn't work that way Jesus paid for
[1:06:09] it all it's not our worthiness that
[1:06:11] matters
[1:06:12] right he was the perfect lamb according
[1:06:15] to the scriptures right he was the Lamb
[1:06:18] of God that took away the sin of the
[1:06:19] world according to the scriptures
[1:06:20] according to the scriptures in the Old
[1:06:22] Testament the lamb was examined the
[1:06:24] worshiper was not examined right just
[1:06:26] like even now the Jews are looking for a
[1:06:28] red hair for sacrifice to make the
[1:06:31] Waters of Separation to purify the
[1:06:32] priesthood that they can build the
[1:06:33] temple and do all those things see but
[1:06:36] but they are and they're under
[1:06:37] expectation it's going to be born they
[1:06:39] even think they have them yeah they're
[1:06:41] not quite old enough to be sacrificed
[1:06:43] yet but they think they have them in
[1:06:44] there and they're praying that not one
[1:06:45] hair will turn a different color than
[1:06:47] red
[1:06:48] now we already have our red hair for
[1:06:50] sacrifice the The Living Word Christ is
[1:06:54] the Waters of Separation but it's
[1:06:56] nothing that we could humanly generate
[1:06:58] that could separate us from sin separate
[1:07:00] us from unbelief no God gave us the
[1:07:02] Waters of separation
[1:07:04] right according to the scriptures he has
[1:07:06] supplied his own sacrifice Lord amen
[1:07:09] amen so all the pressure really our
[1:07:11] faith must be in him not in ourselves
[1:07:14] right of your confidence isn't yourself
[1:07:16] you're going to be disappointed real bad
[1:07:18] but if your confidence and faith is in
[1:07:20] the Lord you can never be disappointed
[1:07:21] because though we take you through a
[1:07:23] trial he'll lead you through the trial
[1:07:25] you know when you lead somebody say come
[1:07:27] we're going here and they follow you and
[1:07:29] you walk through it now we're going over
[1:07:30] here okay okay follow me over here
[1:07:32] hallelujah he doesn't send us anywhere
[1:07:34] and just say go there he he leads us
[1:07:37] there
[1:07:38] he leads us into it and through it I
[1:07:40] mean amen so we've got to have I I trust
[1:07:44] we have the most confidence we've ever
[1:07:46] had in our lives is right now
[1:07:47] it in amen that our lord Jesus according
[1:07:51] to the scriptures has made us ready
[1:07:54] amen that according to the scriptures we
[1:07:56] are new creatures in Christ Jesus right
[1:07:59] that we can look at our lives and say
[1:08:01] what we read about in the scripture we
[1:08:02] are the Fulfillment of it amen we're
[1:08:05] here to take us Transformers will go
[1:08:07] from glory to glory so what we once uh
[1:08:10] the enemy that we once were defeated by
[1:08:12] we conquered it and then we come a year
[1:08:15] forward and we're about higher than we
[1:08:17] were a year ago our character has become
[1:08:19] more like the Lord than it was a year
[1:08:21] ago what going from glory to glory to
[1:08:24] glory
[1:08:26] but who's doing it it's the Lord that's
[1:08:28] what I mean I mean why because he's
[1:08:30] fulfilling his word according to the
[1:08:31] scriptures that he'll have a bride
[1:08:33] without spot or wrinkle washing the
[1:08:34] blood of lamb mate isn't a mate In His
[1:08:36] Image amen and I believe I'm looking at
[1:08:39] a room of people that are the
[1:08:41] Fulfillment amen of that amen of that
[1:08:45] prophecy amen where if the Bible would
[1:08:47] be written after the Rapture you'd say
[1:08:49] they put your name in there and
[1:08:50] according to the scriptures they
[1:08:52] overcome lady I see you they weren't
[1:08:54] lukewarm but they were on fire for God
[1:08:56] they loved him more than anything and
[1:08:58] they overcame the dragon the Beast by
[1:09:01] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:09:02] their testimony that's why at some point
[1:09:04] to testify of what God has promised yeah
[1:09:06] and say I believe God can do it God's on
[1:09:08] his way he's going to fulfill his words
[1:09:10] how's he going to do it I don't know but
[1:09:12] he's going to do it amen Shadrach men
[1:09:14] shaking Abednego just said well if we
[1:09:15] burn we burn but if not he'll Deliver us
[1:09:17] but we're not gonna bow
[1:09:19] amen so we can stand like them and say
[1:09:21] we are not going to bow to this world
[1:09:23] but according to the scriptures we're
[1:09:24] going to walk with God
[1:09:26] Hallelujah
[1:09:28] remember he wants you to walk with him
[1:09:29] more than you want to walk with him he
[1:09:31] wants you that's why he called you in
[1:09:33] the hour he called you because he wanted
[1:09:34] fellowship with you you know we think
[1:09:37] it's just all us looking for God now God
[1:09:38] was looking for us we want that Lord I
[1:09:41] want a closer walk with you the reason
[1:09:42] you feel that way is because he wants a
[1:09:44] closer walk with you he's the one who
[1:09:46] initiates it he's the one who says Lord
[1:09:48] sure there comes a time where you draw
[1:09:50] Knight to have healed your night to you
[1:09:51] but why do we draw night to him is
[1:09:53] because he puts it in our heart to draw
[1:09:55] it like him so I just responded to the
[1:09:57] call you say well I don't feel like it
[1:09:59] well that's why that's why it's so
[1:10:01] important when you don't feel nothing to
[1:10:03] stand there for yeah praise Lord and the
[1:10:05] whole armor of God just stand he say I
[1:10:07] don't feel like it I'm not going back
[1:10:09] you know I don't feel a draw but I'm not
[1:10:11] going back there's nothing for me to go
[1:10:13] back to see the devil said see see the
[1:10:16] devil's got emotions so wrapped up in
[1:10:18] this age and so he will actually go
[1:10:20] before God and say well I bet you if
[1:10:22] they feel nothing they're gonna go back
[1:10:25] you know and God says sure
[1:10:28] fine I'll prove you wrong amen
[1:10:30] amen and then we're here feeling As Dead
[1:10:32] As opposed sometimes
[1:10:34] and the Devil beats us on the head
[1:10:36] saying you're just going through the
[1:10:37] motion and you're just you're listening
[1:10:38] this is just you know you don't feel
[1:10:40] anything so nothing's real but there's
[1:10:41] something in her heart just is but I'm
[1:10:43] not going back
[1:10:44] I still believe
[1:10:46] right and then you go through a period
[1:10:48] of that sometime and then God just yeah
[1:10:51] Satan goes up before God and God says I
[1:10:52] told you so
[1:10:54] because he's got confidence in you I
[1:10:56] told you so devil and then it goes from
[1:10:59] that feeling dry to now a big gusher of
[1:11:02] water just comes down to the Holy Spirit
[1:11:05] Hallelujah because the devil
[1:11:07] has to be God wants to prove to the
[1:11:10] devil that we are not walking by emotion
[1:11:13] only
[1:11:14] we're walking by faith and sometimes we
[1:11:16] have no feelings but sometimes we do but
[1:11:18] we've got to have confidence you know if
[1:11:20] you don't feel anything
[1:11:22] don't say this is just how you're going
[1:11:24] to be for the rest of your life never
[1:11:25] set off that you're going to come
[1:11:26] through that right you've got to come
[1:11:28] back up the mountain again
[1:11:30] amen we should be full of joy on speaker
[1:11:33] full of Glory Hallelujah
[1:11:36] I trust we can look at our lives and we
[1:11:38] could go into this a lot deeper but I'm
[1:11:39] just going to finish it here but we
[1:11:41] could look at our lives and say it's all
[1:11:43] according to the scriptures right how we
[1:11:46] talk to each other is according to the
[1:11:48] scriptures how we dress is according to
[1:11:50] the scriptures how we talk to people on
[1:11:52] the street as a you know how we treat
[1:11:54] one another treat people treat our
[1:11:55] family all those things should we all be
[1:11:57] according to the scriptures not
[1:11:59] according to how we feel but according
