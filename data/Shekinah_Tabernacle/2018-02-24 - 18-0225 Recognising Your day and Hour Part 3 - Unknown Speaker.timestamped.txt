[49:43] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[49:45] and there was delivered unto him the
[49:47] book of the prophet Isaiah
[49:48] and when he had when he had opened the
[49:50] book he found the place where it was
[49:52] written the Spirit Lord is upon me
[49:54] because he has anointed me to preach the
[49:56] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[49:58] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[50:00] deliverance to the captives and they
[50:02] were covering of the sites of the blind
[50:03] and sit at liberty them that are bruised
[50:05] to preach the acceptable year of the
[50:07] Lord and he closed the book and he gave
[50:09] it again to the minister and sat down
[50:11] and the eyes of all them that were in
[50:13] the synagogue were fastened on him
[50:14] and he began to say unto them this day
[50:17] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[50:21] Allu you and let's go to hebrews hebrews
[50:25] chapter 11
[50:33] hebrews 11:8 in verses eight to 11 now

[51:01] country dwelling and the Tabernacles of
[51:03] Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of
[51:05] the same promise for he looked for a
[51:08] city which hath foundations whose
[51:10] builder and maker is God now this is the
[51:13] scripture I want to you through faith
[51:14] also Sara herself received strength to
[51:18] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[51:20] child when she was past age because she
[51:23] judged him faithful who had promised I
[51:27] mean my Lord blesses word you may have
[51:29] your seats I'd like to welcome sister
[51:31] know me as well god bless you just he
[51:33] feel at home good to have you here amen
[51:35] and so one who I want to take a I want
[51:41] to take a thought from especially
[51:43] Genesis chapter 18 but we have we read
[51:46] here in Luke chapter 4 where the Lord
[51:50] Himself stood and he took the scripture
[51:52] and he read he read the scripture
[51:54] pertaining to his day an hour in his
[51:56] ministry and he said this day the
[51:58] scripture is fulfilled
[51:59] now don't no doubt there were many many
[52:02] rabbis probably may have would have read
[52:04] the scripture and they would have
[52:05] everyone else who could have read the
[52:06] read the Bible they would have been
[52:08] reading it but when it comes when
[52:10] someone would stand and would take that
[52:12] scripture and find it in the he says he
[52:14] found it in the scroll and he read it
[52:16] and he was declaring this day this
[52:19] scripture is fulfilled in your ears it
[52:21] was a different kind of service and they
[52:23] weren't rejoicing they got angry they
[52:26] got you you continue to read the story
[52:28] and they wanted to take him out the city
[52:29] and throw him down a hill they wanted to
[52:32] destroy him and he was a very messiah
[52:33] the very word became flesh and he began
[52:36] to say this day this scripture is
[52:38] fulfilled in your ears now we read there
[52:41] in Hebrews chapter 11 because we from
[52:45] from the journey with Abraham now
[52:47] he would abraham would journey for 25
[52:50] years with god he believes the promise
[52:53] of God but Sarah herself had to be had
[52:56] to believe it as well and so near the
[52:59] end of the journey she had to have a
[53:01] visitation of God herself to turn her
[53:04] heart from unbelief to faith that even
[53:06] though she was part of the promise she
[53:08] had to recognize herself by the promise
[53:11] it was no good just Abraham telling her
[53:13] we're going to have the promised son
[53:14] he's going to be called Isaac he's going
[53:17] to be out here God told us we're going
[53:18] to have the son it was no good just for
[53:20] Abraham to tell her goddess God Himself
[53:23] had to come and turn her heart from
[53:25] doubt unbelief to faith hallelujah and
[53:28] the church has been journeying for 2,000
[53:32] years amen and finally there's come a
[53:34] visitation of God where her heart has
[53:37] turned from from doubt can it really
[53:39] happen can we really go on a rapture is
[53:42] these all things must be and God has
[53:44] turned the heart amen of the bride from
[53:47] doubting the promise to judging him
[53:50] faithful who has promised hallelujah and
[53:52] that's just not the bright around the
[53:54] world that has to come to you where God
[53:57] would visit you in a supernatural way
[53:59] where it turns your heart from unbelief
[54:01] in the word and doubt is that really
[54:03] that important doesn't really matter is
[54:05] it really going to be so and he turns
[54:07] your heart from that to faith in his
[54:08] word that you judge him faithful the God
[54:11] who gave the word they gave the
[54:13] scripture they gave the message will
[54:15] perform what he says he will do oh uh
[54:19] this is from the state of scriptures
[54:22] fulfilled now you want to go listen to a
[54:24] service you want to go listen to this
[54:26] one because you must understand we know
[54:29] when a prophet comes upon the scene and
[54:31] he preaches a sermon or you know he's
[54:34] not just thinking of something to tickle
[54:36] the people's is he's not just giving
[54:39] you're paying heed to itching ears I
[54:42] pray it's exactly the same thing here
[54:45] but he's declaring something he's
[54:47] because God wants us to see the day now
[54:49] in which we live now he sees here notice
[54:53] the Messiah so this day the scripture is
[54:56] fulfilled the Prophet opens worth the
[54:58] scripture we just read in the Book of
[55:00] Luke
[55:01] and he says notice the Messiah standing
[55:04] in the platform to identify himself with
[55:06] the word of promise for that age how
[55:10] strange the Messiah standing up before
[55:12] the church and look at those and look at
[55:14] these precious words when you hear him
[55:16] say here to preach the acceptable year
[55:19] even goes because it's talking about the
[55:21] year of Jubilee he talks about the
[55:23] Messiah standing in the platform to
[55:26] identify himself with the word of
[55:28] promise for that age now I really want
[55:30] this to anchor in real deep because we
[55:33] understand that he is he is the
[55:35] anointing he is the he is the Spirit of
[55:38] God the must that that word that spirit
[55:40] that led Israel out of Egypt into the
[55:42] Promised Land that burning you know that
[55:45] pillar of fire became flesh and so that
[55:49] same one that spoke to Moses and spoke
[55:51] to Abraham and spoke to David and
[55:52] Solomon all the prophets he became flesh
[55:54] and he was there to identify himself
[55:58] with the promise word of that age and so
[56:01] he is the same yesterday today and
[56:03] forever so if he is standing here if he
[56:05] was standing 2,000 years ago
[56:07] in flesh declaring himself I'm going to
[56:10] identify myself with this scripture and
[56:13] I'm going to make it come to pass he's
[56:15] the same God he was back then as present
[56:17] now so I could just say he's standing in
[56:21] the platform amen to identify himself
[56:23] with the promise word of the age
[56:26] hallelujah that's what he's doing
[56:28] because you can't just put that back
[56:30] because brother BAM he preaches this day
[56:32] the scripture is fulfilled and he goes
[56:34] down from from from Moses and he goes
[56:36] down all the way through then he comes
[56:39] into his own ministry and he begins to
[56:41] speak about God coming down on the Ohio
[56:43] River when he's baptizing the 17th
[56:46] person pillar of fire comes down a voice
[56:48] speaks out as john the baptist was sent
[56:50] to forerun the first coming your message
[56:53] will forerun the second coming and he
[56:55] says this day this scripture is
[56:57] fulfilled in your ears hallelujah and
[57:00] and brother Danny Stephens grandma was
[57:02] in that service and she said they're
[57:04] such a powerful anointing in that place
[57:06] that he could have said all in one role
[57:08] down the old everyone would have there's
[57:10] such a powerful atmosphere and you can
[57:13] hear it you could
[57:14] that was his words that was her was this
[57:16] what she said about there's such a
[57:17] powerful atmosphere because God was
[57:19] standing there saying this day this
[57:22] scripture this visitation has been
[57:25] fulfilled and let's not be dull of
[57:27] hearing about it
[57:28] let's not just put it off 60 years ago
[57:31] because God is calling a people and we
[57:33] have to be changed to fit the pattern of
[57:35] the word I mean if God is called a word
[57:38] bride a manifestation of the scripture
[57:41] every part of it if he is called her to
[57:45] become us where does a lord change me to
[57:48] fit that pattern we must be you say God
[57:51] changed my heart that I've met your word
[57:54] because he's not going to change we
[57:57] can't we can't actually hold him to
[57:59] ransom and say God you got to check
[58:01] you got to change your ways people
[58:04] trying to hold God to ransom he's not a
[58:06] hostage we become the hostage we become
[58:10] the love prisoner hallelujah has not out
[58:13] of a resentment it's a yes Lord
[58:15] I'm so privileged friends Billy Graham
[58:19] passed away I'm sure you all know her
[58:22] brother Brahim says a lot about Billy
[58:24] Graham and he speaks about let's just go
[58:27] to Genesis 18 because I want to you know
[58:33] when when a when a prophet stands and he
[58:38] and he says and he goes back into the
[58:41] scripture and he says this is happening
[58:43] he's not clutching at straws to find
[58:46] some nice story that somehow fits he's
[58:48] God is showing you see what's happening
[58:50] here this is repeating again here and
[58:53] the conditions that were there here and
[58:58] he does that that you'll understand
[59:00] where you are because Abraham was called
[59:02] and he journeyed from a strange land to
[59:06] a land of promise and the last
[59:08] visitation that they had and it turned
[59:11] Sarah's heart from doubt on the promise
[59:14] to faith in the promise was God coming
[59:17] down to angels came down with them in
[59:19] flesh and and God himself discerned knew
[59:23] what Sarah was thinking in her heart and
[59:25] he were going to say why did she
[59:27] laughs because I've told you according
[59:30] to time of life you're going to have the
[59:31] promised son and if you read the chapter
[59:33] before that God comes down and speaks to
[59:36] Abraham said it he said well that's just
[59:38] fine then I was really Easter so
[59:40] striking you know let's not be I believe
[59:45] with all my heart God makes the promise
[59:48] what is going to happen very real to his
[59:51] children and we must never just let that
[59:53] become common where God would take a
[59:56] word and it would more than just be
[59:58] excitement maybe of a meeting or someone
[1:00:00] else's enthusiasm but he comes and
[1:00:03] speaks to you personally and he tells
[1:00:05] you this is what's going to happen you
[1:00:07] are going to go in a rapture I'm going
[1:00:09] to change your body amen I trustees
[1:00:12] actually said that the it's not just
[1:00:13] excitement it's not just well I see the
[1:00:15] world falling apart so I have to go
[1:00:17] somewhere but something's anchored in
[1:00:18] your soul there's a body there's an
[1:00:21] eternal word body reserved for me in the
[1:00:23] heavens and I'm going to change from
[1:00:25] this this boy's gonna be changed to meet
[1:00:27] that body hallelujah so now so we read I
[1:00:37] don't have this on here sorry but we go
[1:00:38] to Genesis 17 and we'll read verse 20
[1:00:45] and 21 it was just before the visitation
[1:00:48] and as for Ishmael I have heard thee
[1:00:51] behold I have blessed him and will make
[1:00:52] him a fruitful and will multiply him
[1:00:54] exceedingly twelve Prince's shall he
[1:00:56] beget and I'll make him a great nation
[1:00:58] but my covenant will I establish with
[1:01:02] Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:01:05] at the set time in the next year you see
[1:01:09] why Abraham was under expectation
[1:01:11] because God had just told them you're
[1:01:14] gonna she's going to have the son and
[1:01:16] though the promise is tarried now it's
[1:01:18] going to happen
[1:01:19] don't be weary in well-doing there's
[1:01:22] going to be a meeting in the air and God
[1:01:25] you say God mold and changed my life my
[1:01:28] heart that I met that I fit the criteria
[1:01:31] to meet you in the air amen
[1:01:34] we have to God has to get a hold of us
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:39] I don't want to
[1:01:41] I don't want to just have a church and
[1:01:43] we find ourselves in a tribulation you
[1:01:46] know because some people will end up in
[1:01:49] the tribulation I don't want to be in
[1:01:51] that category and I don't want to stand
[1:01:53] there before God and him ask why did you
[1:01:56] not tell them I don't want blood on my
[1:02:00] hands so now Isaac is here
[1:02:03] I mean Abraham so he's been told this is
[1:02:07] what's going to happen and in the Lord
[1:02:09] Himself now Genesis 18 were on the on
[1:02:12] the screen now and the Lord appeared
[1:02:14] unto him in the plains of memory and he
[1:02:16] sat in the tent door on the heat of the
[1:02:17] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:02:20] and behold three of them three men stood
[1:02:24] by him and when he saw them he ran to
[1:02:26] meet them from the tent door and bowed
[1:02:28] himself towards the ground said my lord
[1:02:30] if now I have found favor in thy sight
[1:02:33] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[1:02:36] servant and they said unto Him where is
[1:02:40] Sarah thy wife so I were just dropping
[1:02:42] down a few verses and and they said on
[1:02:44] them where is Sarah thy wife I said
[1:02:46] behold in the tent and he said I will
[1:02:48] certainly return unto the according to
[1:02:50] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[1:02:52] shall bear thee a son and Sarah heard it
[1:02:55] in the tent which was behind him and
[1:02:58] this is verse 11 of Abraham and Sarah
[1:03:00] were old and well stricken an age and it
[1:03:02] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:03:04] of woman because there were nearly a
[1:03:06] hundred wherefore Sarah laugh to earn
[1:03:09] herself saying after I a waxed old shall
[1:03:11] I have pleasure with my lord being old
[1:03:13] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:03:16] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:03:18] surely bear a child which I'm old is
[1:03:22] anything too hard for the Lord underline
[1:03:27] that if you underline Scripture in your
[1:03:28] Bible there's anything too hard in the
[1:03:31] Lord at the time appointed armed at the
[1:03:37] time pointed I'll return unto the
[1:03:39] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:03:40] shall have a son in Sarah denied saying
[1:03:43] I laughed not for she was afraid and he
[1:03:46] said nay thou did us laugh that's how
[1:03:50] he's gonna read a bit more and the main
[1:03:53] rose up from thence and look towards
[1:03:54] and Abraham went with them to bring them
[1:03:57] on the way and the Lord said shall I
[1:03:58] hide from Abraham the thing which I
[1:04:00] shall do seeing that Abraham shall be
[1:04:03] surely become a great and mighty nation
[1:04:05] and all the nations of the earth shall
[1:04:08] be blessed in him now you say well this
[1:04:13] is this day these scriptures are being
[1:04:16] fulfilled the story we just read is more
[1:04:19] than a story its prophecy its prophecy
[1:04:22] of an endtime people where God has to
[1:04:25] come because remember here we are here
[1:04:27] we're at the end time Abraham journeyed
[1:04:30] with lot
[1:04:31] they came a time where they had to
[1:04:32] separate cuz lot was nominal he wasn't
[1:04:35] even called Abraham was called but
[1:04:37] because he went with Abraham he received
[1:04:39] father blessing the neighbor that became
[1:04:41] upon Abraham he became very rich as well
[1:04:43] but then he but then there had to come a
[1:04:45] separation and he pitched his teeth
[1:04:47] towards Sodom and he found himself stuck
[1:04:49] in Sodom you know you're after a while
[1:04:51] and he was trapped in that place and the
[1:04:54] Bible says that the life that the
[1:04:56] sodomites loved grieved and Victor's
[1:04:59] righteous soul and so here we are now in
[1:05:02] this world where we can all agree we are
[1:05:05] living in Sodom and Gomorrah again he
[1:05:08] said well it's been like this way for
[1:05:09] years don't need to become common to you
[1:05:11] these things must need to be whether we
[1:05:15] like it or not and you see the spirit
[1:05:17] there and in in Genesis there how there
[1:05:20] were men and they were trying to because
[1:05:23] the two angels we'd down to Lots house
[1:05:24] and and not receive them into the house
[1:05:27] and the men of the city tried to force
[1:05:29] their way in into his house to grab
[1:05:32] those angels and have their way with
[1:05:33] them it was aggressive aggressive spirit
[1:05:36] it's still aggressive today it's still
[1:05:40] aggressive today so we are living in
[1:05:44] Sodom and Gomorrha conditions again the
[1:05:47] world has become that way whether we
[1:05:48] like it or not this is just how it is
[1:05:50] because the prophecy is being lived out
[1:05:53] again so now there's lot and his family
[1:05:56] down in Sodom Abraham's on the plains of
[1:05:59] Mamre
[1:05:59] Abraham's waiting for a visitation that
[1:06:02] they will receive the promised son and
[1:06:04] there's and there's two and and lot is
[1:06:07] down in Sodom he
[1:06:08] changed Sodom he's fixed by it but he
[1:06:11] can't change the world he's living in
[1:06:12] and there's two classes of Christians
[1:06:14] today there's a group that's down and
[1:06:16] stuck in the world nominal they want to
[1:06:19] fix the world they want to make it
[1:06:20] Christian again they would have a big
[1:06:22] Christian sweep across the world and and
[1:06:24] convert the world but they can't but
[1:06:26] they're ineffective and what they're
[1:06:27] doing amen they are you go look at the
[1:06:30] church world unfortunately it's just
[1:06:32] more people gathering there's no real
[1:06:34] birth there's no change they they come
[1:06:36] in the door they may give a profession
[1:06:39] but then they walk out the same way
[1:06:40] nothing against them they're sincere
[1:06:42] people but that's the condition they're
[1:06:44] in and the world vixx's them because
[1:06:47] they want to fix it what's the big had a
[1:06:50] Trump get into the White House let's
[1:06:51] make America great again
[1:06:53] the MBA evangelicals they tell the
[1:06:55] churches you got to vote for him and it
[1:06:57] swung the election his way the
[1:06:59] evangelical vote because they were
[1:07:01] looking they're looking for a champion
[1:07:03] to try and make the nation Christian
[1:07:05] again and they found it in Donald Trump
[1:07:11] some of you look at me like really yes
[1:07:13] really because they're looking for a
[1:07:16] champion we have a champion he is the
[1:07:20] Lord Jesus Christ but because they are
[1:07:22] nominal thinking they're looking how can
[1:07:24] we get a natural man to help us make a
[1:07:27] Christian again because they're
[1:07:28] nominally thinking they're not
[1:07:29] spiritually minded unfortunately and so
[1:07:33] they're trying to make the nation
[1:07:33] Christian again let's go back to our
[1:07:35] founding fathers water once was but they
[1:07:38] can't take it back there and they won't
[1:07:40] be able to take it back there because
[1:07:42] they are fulfilling what light is doing
[1:07:44] and it's the same thing in you see on
[1:07:47] all the Western world we want to make it
[1:07:48] Christian together and they're in there
[1:07:50] vexed by how the world is but they can't
[1:07:53] do anything about it so there's a group
[1:07:55] and then there's another group and we'll
[1:07:58] come back to their group later that's
[1:08:00] waiting for the change in the body
[1:08:02] because because we're waiting for the
[1:08:04] promised son
[1:08:05] are we not we're waiting to meet him in
[1:08:07] the air so there's a group that's not
[1:08:09] and not in Sodom and we may live in this
[1:08:12] world but we're not of this world jesus
[1:08:15] prayed that he that we wouldn't be taken
[1:08:17] out of the world but would be kept in
[1:08:19] this present world hello
[1:08:22] yeah did he not he pray thee said father
[1:08:24] I don't ask that you take them from the
[1:08:26] world but I pray you'd keep them in this
[1:08:28] world amen
[1:08:30] so some of us I pray you can all say I'm
[1:08:32] one of them I am living out Jesus's
[1:08:35] prayer for me hallelujah he prayed and
[1:08:38] I'm the answer to his prayer hallelujah
[1:08:42] Amen I true I say no one cares about me
[1:08:45] Jesus prayed for you in the days of his
[1:08:47] flesh he thought of you and he was
[1:08:48] praying amen he say Lord answer that
[1:08:52] prayer and continue to answer that
[1:08:54] prayer so now here we have lot as stuck
[1:08:58] in Sodom Abraham is out on the plains of
[1:09:00] Mamre waiting for the promised son but
[1:09:03] Sarah's heart is going to be turned to
[1:09:05] faith because she's been doubting the
[1:09:07] promise and then God Himself comes comes
[1:09:11] down and flesh discerns her heart and
[1:09:14] turns her heart from from doubting the
[1:09:17] promise to faith amen
[1:09:20] but the same time now there's two angels
[1:09:23] with God and flesh and they go down into
[1:09:26] Sodom and their job is to call out lot
[1:09:29] because lot because because they God
[1:09:34] knows that's why we read there there was
[1:09:36] last part of our reading shall we
[1:09:37] withhold from Abraham what we're going
[1:09:40] to do and God and he says when the
[1:09:43] Spirit of Truth has come he will lead
[1:09:44] you and guide you into all truth he will
[1:09:46] show you things as must shortly come to
[1:09:48] pass amen
[1:09:50] so the areas he's saying sure we
[1:09:52] withhold from what what I'm going to do
[1:09:54] is he know so of it and then the next
[1:09:56] chapter he begins to tell about how God
[1:09:58] God tells Abraham after the two angels
[1:10:02] have already begun to walk down and to
[1:10:03] Sodom they've already left he says we're
[1:10:06] gonna burn this place this Gentile world
[1:10:08] is gonna burn with fire and then Abraham
[1:10:10] begins to under seed surely this should
[1:10:13] be more what if you find 15 he goes down
[1:10:16] to about 10 and I believe he went down a
[1:10:18] bit more he would have spared the place
[1:10:20] but so here is a group they're waiting
[1:10:24] for the promised son then two angels go
[1:10:27] down into into Sodom now I read this in
[1:10:30] the beginning let's go back here this
[1:10:34] quote here
[1:10:35] Masaya standing to identify himself with
[1:10:37] the promised word of the age it's
[1:10:39] because we understand that's an
[1:10:40] anointing they meant
[1:10:43] that's an anointing so Abraham now so
[1:10:47] brother Branham identifies himself and
[1:10:51] he identifies the anointing on the two
[1:10:54] angels are we all familiar with this he
[1:10:58] takes this story and he brings it down
[1:11:00] into now and he says do it he sees the
[1:11:03] two angels that went down and to Sodom
[1:11:05] and he doesn't just speak he doesn't
[1:11:11] just speak now of Billy Graham and all
[1:11:15] Roberts just as the two people but
[1:11:18] there's anointing upon them they were
[1:11:19] the two that spearheaded that move to go
[1:11:22] down get the church nominal but you'll
[1:11:25] see what they did as you see here what
[1:11:29] was the message there were three angels
[1:11:31] went down two of them a Billy Graham and
[1:11:32] a Jack Schuler went down into Sodom and
[1:11:34] preached just the message of gospel
[1:11:35] deliverance to the people but what angel
[1:11:38] stayed behind with the elected Abraham
[1:11:40] and his group and the angel had us back
[1:11:42] to into the tent and Sarah laughed
[1:11:44] inside the tent angel said why did Sarah
[1:11:45] laugh how did he know she laughed in the
[1:11:49] team behind him that was the last
[1:11:51] message that Sodom had before the
[1:11:53] destruction and here's the last signs
[1:11:55] that God would show before the
[1:11:56] annihilation receive it believe it be
[1:12:00] saved
[1:12:00] let's bow our heads just a moment are
[1:12:02] you aware of his presence I think it's a
[1:12:04] very important question
[1:12:05] you say but the asides of miracles still
[1:12:07] done yes but there's a major sign where
[1:12:10] God would come down and flesh and
[1:12:11] discern what is going on in the hearts
[1:12:13] of the people and he's saying he's
[1:12:15] saying now this ministry this ministry
[1:12:18] has repeated and and that was his
[1:12:21] ministry that he had they meant that was
[1:12:24] his ministry he had but then when he
[1:12:26] spoke about Billy Graham and he speaks
[1:12:28] of all Roberts he sees about Jack Shula
[1:12:30] and and a group of them he sees it I
[1:12:37] remember two preachers of modern Billy
[1:12:39] Graham and and Oh somebody else you'd
[1:12:41] say that any great evangelist or
[1:12:43] Robertson or some of them went down to
[1:12:45] Sodom and preached they were great
[1:12:47] preachers but did they do
[1:12:49] siting down there a miracle but not a
[1:12:51] sign what went down into Sodom and they
[1:12:53] preached a warning message that they'd
[1:12:55] better get out for God's coming to
[1:12:57] destroy it and who's doing any better
[1:12:59] job on it today than Billy Graham and
[1:13:01] that bunch
[1:13:02] I respect Billy Graham a great man of
[1:13:05] God he's got a great ministry I can see
[1:13:07] some of them say well don't well he
[1:13:10] don't believe in divine healing IBC's he
[1:13:14] says that's fine he's doing his job but
[1:13:16] but what brother Bram is saying is it's
[1:13:17] an anointing just like brother Bram
[1:13:20] wasn't wasn't God became flesh speaking
[1:13:24] to Abraham the anointing that was on God
[1:13:26] came upon him
[1:13:28] hey you're following me he wasn't the
[1:13:30] Lord that came on the plains of Mamre
[1:13:32] brother Branham wasn't him that was God
[1:13:35] made a body stepped in it and he went
[1:13:37] down visited as his children it's the
[1:13:39] same thing today brother baron wasn't
[1:13:41] God amen that he wasn't God in a flesh
[1:13:46] body like Jesus was he was a sinner
[1:13:48] saved by grace or thing to be a word
[1:13:49] prophet to the aged and God used him to
[1:13:52] reveal himself
[1:13:53] right so it's anointing it's an
[1:13:55] anointing amen it's the same thing like
[1:13:57] the anointing of Billy Graham and all
[1:13:59] Roberts and he says Jack Schuler and a
[1:14:01] bunch of them they were sent down to the
[1:14:03] earth but you read the Ministry of those
[1:14:07] two angels when they go down to lot all
[1:14:09] they did was blind the people and the
[1:14:11] people couldn't find the door
[1:14:13] you go read it in Genesis do we all know
[1:14:16] our Bible stories
[1:14:17] should we have Sunday school for a
[1:14:19] little bit they went down all they did
[1:14:24] was blind the people that they couldn't
[1:14:26] find the door and they were stacked
[1:14:28] there in the destruction that was their
[1:14:30] ministry now I know there's not a great
[1:14:33] big hallelujah praise the Lord but
[1:14:35] that's what but their mission was to get
[1:14:37] the church nominal out before the
[1:14:40] destruction that was their job and so
[1:14:43] now the anointing that was on Billy
[1:14:45] Graham and Oral Roberts and different
[1:14:46] ones that anointing is still here
[1:14:48] just like the anointing that was on the
[1:14:50] Prophet that didn't leave when the
[1:14:52] Prophet went home but I read that quote
[1:14:54] the Messiah is standing in the platform
[1:14:56] to identify himself with the promise
[1:14:59] word because they're not historians I'm
[1:15:02] not just
[1:15:02] but display bomb talk about where any
[1:15:03] churches with his believers you
[1:15:07] understand what I'm saying because
[1:15:09] they're still in anointing is an
[1:15:11] anointing here to turn our hearts from
[1:15:13] doubt in the promise to faith in the
[1:15:16] promise hallelujah
[1:15:18] the Ministry of Malachi for was to turn
[1:15:21] our hearts from the children back to the
[1:15:23] faith of the fathers I mean that our our
[1:15:26] hearts would return that we would
[1:15:28] believe the same thing the Epis taluk
[1:15:31] fathers believed there was his ministry
[1:15:33] and that anointing of Malachi 4 is still
[1:15:36] here in his word I mean that's why
[1:15:38] that's why we listen to the missus why
[1:15:40] we study that's why we pray you know
[1:15:42] because there's an anointing in that
[1:15:44] word they're still here and that and
[1:15:46] that anointing must be in a living
[1:15:48] vessel it's not enough just to be in in
[1:15:51] the forerunner but that same anointing
[1:15:53] that was on the prophet has to be coming
[1:15:55] to the bride I mean just like Elijah and
[1:15:58] Elijah hallelujah Elijah continue -
[1:16:02] Elijah's ministry amen as in there right
[1:16:06] the same anointing that was on Elijah
[1:16:07] came upon Elijah
[1:16:09] I meant and He fulfilled what many
[1:16:14] things what Elijah said that he would do
[1:16:16] because it was the same God but working
[1:16:18] through a different vessel and it's the
[1:16:20] same thing it's the same thing with the
[1:16:22] Bride of Christ brother Brahim says that
[1:16:24] she under her her messenger she under
[1:16:29] her messenger well how do you get under
[1:16:30] the messenger you receive his word and
[1:16:32] you believe his word therefore you place
[1:16:36] yourself he says she under her messenger
[1:16:38] becomes the final voice to the final age
[1:16:42] amen that's not just playing tapes they
[1:16:45] become a living voice to the aged and
[1:16:48] you got to say that's talking about me I
[1:16:50] become you're going to become a living
[1:16:53] witness of this word hallelujah where
[1:16:56] it's the same God comes and lives in you
[1:16:57] amen that's what we're called to me and
[1:17:00] living witness I mean it's not you doing
[1:17:02] it it's God doing it
[1:17:04] hallelujah he said well I'm not called
[1:17:06] to preach you may not be called to
[1:17:07] preach you may not be able to sing or
[1:17:09] play anything but your life should be a
[1:17:11] living witness I mean that my god reigns
[1:17:14] my redeemer lives
[1:17:16] hallelujah everyday we're preaching your
[1:17:19] life is speaking I mean that's the
[1:17:22] thunder that shakes the devil is a life
[1:17:24] consecrated to God brother says we need
[1:17:26] in Jeffersonville I'll say we need in
[1:17:29] Wellington wherever we're from thousands
[1:17:31] of lives voices this is the thunder that
[1:17:33] shakes the devil
[1:17:35] I lived voice hallelujah so that's what
[1:17:38] we need to be I mean so now they go on
[1:17:42] to Sodom they gone to Sodom they fulfill
[1:17:45] their ministry and then right after that
[1:17:48] it says then God goes down into Sodom
[1:17:50] and you don't hear anything about it he
[1:17:52] just he just scenes the fire now their
[1:17:56] ministry is done their ministry is done
[1:18:00] they meant sure they're still salvation
[1:18:03] but the truth at spier he did that
[1:18:05] revival of calling lot out is done do
[1:18:09] you know where we are that's done God
[1:18:14] Himself is here but I've seen many times
[1:18:16] the main thing God is interested in is
[1:18:18] his bride you are you are what he is
[1:18:22] interested in he's not worried about
[1:18:24] everything else he's been waiting for
[1:18:27] you to come to the earth he thought of
[1:18:29] you in his mind before the foundation of
[1:18:32] the world and he didn't see you as a
[1:18:34] poor decrepit sinner lost and undone and
[1:18:36] unbelief he didn't think of you in that
[1:18:39] way he was thinking of standing mane and
[1:18:42] his image I mean everything he is she is
[1:18:45] a man that's what he thought of you as
[1:18:47] victorious the serpent under her feet I
[1:18:51] meant her own personality and humanity
[1:18:54] under subject to the Word of God
[1:18:56] you're the greatest miracle Jesus did he
[1:18:59] goes to the garden you know what the
[1:19:01] greatest miracle he was he went to the
[1:19:03] garden he had to go to Calvary as a man
[1:19:05] and the Spirit of God left him you know
[1:19:08] what the greatest miracle he was he
[1:19:10] subjected his flesh to the word that was
[1:19:12] allotted to him that was a miracle you
[1:19:14] say well what about casting out Legion
[1:19:16] and doing all those things no the
[1:19:18] greatest miracles he subjected this he
[1:19:22] subjected this not my will but thy will
[1:19:24] be done and that's how he got the
[1:19:27] victory
[1:19:28] it's got to be the same thing with us
[1:19:29] it's wind it's not Oh God comes down and
[1:19:32] we shout and we rejoice no it's going to
[1:19:34] be a point we don't feel anything we say
[1:19:37] not my will your would be done and
[1:19:39] everything we do say and think they
[1:19:42] would be done God is looking for a
[1:19:44] people that are his word he's not
[1:19:47] looking for anything else we don't want
[1:19:49] to be left behind
[1:19:50] they'll come a time there will come a
[1:19:53] time when it's done and then let them
[1:19:57] that a filthy be filthy still
[1:19:58] let them be righteous be righteous still
[1:20:00] let them be holy be holy still
[1:20:02] they will come that time amen depends
[1:20:07] where you want to be God is a absolute
[1:20:10] gentleman you won't force nothing on you
[1:20:13] we don't want to take for granted it's
[1:20:15] got to be a life expressed doesn't
[1:20:18] matter how much we shout sing and dance
[1:20:20] it's a life it's a life of the word in
[1:20:23] you that's what had to happen with Sarah
[1:20:25] her heart had to be turned from doubt to
[1:20:28] faith hallelujah she had to believe the
[1:20:31] promise that was allotted to her the
[1:20:33] word do you understand do you understand
[1:20:37] God has seen her word to you and you say
[1:20:41] Lord caused me to believe it amen
[1:20:44] you gotta say Lord caused me to
[1:20:46] understand it you've spoken to me in my
[1:20:49] language you've called me your your
[1:20:53] Spirit has drawn me do you believe it
[1:20:56] respond to it and say yes Lord you don't
[1:20:59] have to become perfect and then you live
[1:21:01] his word he takes you there he makes you
[1:21:04] thus you are the sculpture and he is the
[1:21:07] artist amen he takes you like a big
[1:21:09] piece of marble and he has something in
[1:21:12] his mind I want to make a big sculpture
[1:21:14] and he takes his hammer and chisel takes
[1:21:16] you and he begins to work on you work on
[1:21:19] you you understand it's like painting a
[1:21:21] picture your blank canvas you may be
[1:21:24] covered all in darkness he wipes it off
[1:21:26] then he gets his paintbrush he begins to
[1:21:29] paint you early because he has it in his
[1:21:32] mind this is why you're going to be and
[1:21:34] this is what he wants you to be
[1:21:37] amen the Messiah standing present to
[1:21:44] identify himself with the promised word
[1:21:45] of the day so now here we are now their
[1:21:53] main the main Ministry of that is now
[1:21:55] done Lots being basically called out
[1:21:59] there's still people there but now
[1:22:02] there's a promise to a woman who's been
[1:22:05] part of the promise for 2,000 years and
[1:22:08] she has doubted the promise but there
[1:22:11] comes a time when the hardest turned
[1:22:13] from doubt to faith in his word Amen now
[1:22:18] I trust you can say I'm a Sarah Amen I
[1:22:23] wanted to really I don't want I want us
[1:22:26] to walk out different and I talked about
[1:22:30] me myself as well I don't want to just
[1:22:32] come to church and be the same old
[1:22:34] person and do the same old thing and
[1:22:37] live the same old kind of life and not
[1:22:40] get any more victory and no gain any
[1:22:42] more ground
[1:22:43] I want to conquer every place it's mine
[1:22:45] every promise in the Bible is mine I
[1:22:48] want to see it I don't just want to talk
[1:22:50] about it there's how I feel I mean this
[1:22:54] word has been God has taken an open book
[1:22:57] he's unsealed the promise and he's
[1:22:59] delivered it to you amen he doesn't want
[1:23:02] you just to say that's nice and dandy
[1:23:03] and put it on the Shelf he's given it to
[1:23:06] you that you had manifested I mean just
[1:23:08] like Joshua Joshua and Caleb the word
[1:23:11] the law they received was given to them
[1:23:14] that they would possess the promised
[1:23:16] land that was what was given and they
[1:23:18] said let's go take it
[1:23:20] hallelujah they didn't just got the
[1:23:22] promise they said this is my promise I
[1:23:24] mean they had a visitation
[1:23:26] hallelujah they saw God come down on
[1:23:28] Sinai they saw him up in the Red Sea
[1:23:30] they knew that's the reason we're being
[1:23:32] called out wasn't just to die in the
[1:23:34] wilderness
[1:23:34] imagine them standing there all of other
[1:23:37] all of us rolls there did you bring us
[1:23:39] out here to die how many times they
[1:23:41] complain to Moses did you bring us out
[1:23:43] here to die we had a better life back in
[1:23:45] the world I was happier in the world I
[1:23:48] enjoyed the food better in the world can
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:51] that'd be Stanley saying what why are
[1:23:53] you people complaining why are you
[1:23:56] complaining God hasn't seen us out here
[1:23:58] to die of course he hasn't seen us
[1:24:00] brought us out here to die
[1:24:01] you understand mentioned may just indeed
[1:24:04] say Joshua did you hear that they're
[1:24:07] crazy
[1:24:11] God's done so much for us he's called us
[1:24:14] out he's revealed himself he's delivered
[1:24:17] us we're not under the slave slave yoke
[1:24:20] anymore of the world we're free
[1:24:22] we're are free people and they're
[1:24:25] complaining they want to go back to
[1:24:26] bondage that's madness that's insanity
[1:24:30] this world brother Brahim says he says
[1:24:33] this world is not too far from going
[1:24:34] totally insane and he says I want to
[1:24:37] tell you it before it happens this world
[1:24:42] is insane I don't care who he's this
[1:24:45] this world has gone mad because this
[1:24:48] world they say we can fix the world
[1:24:51] insanity is China is basically fighting
[1:24:54] you heater against a brick wall and
[1:24:56] expecting a different result that is
[1:24:59] basically insanity oh it's going to be
[1:25:01] it's going to it's going to be a bit
[1:25:03] different this time now it's really
[1:25:05] going to work
[1:25:06] let's go I'll do it this way this is
[1:25:10] what the world is done and it's the same
[1:25:13] brick wall and it's the same head and it
[1:25:16] doesn't do any good or we can eradicate
[1:25:19] disease but it's greed so it doesn't
[1:25:21] work we can take away the famine but is
[1:25:23] greed doesn't work we can have world
[1:25:26] peace
[1:25:26] for this national Spurs controlling
[1:25:28] different nations doesn't work we'll
[1:25:31] ever UN doesn't work we'll have an other
[1:25:34] group doesn't work that's insanity we
[1:25:39] have the best technology amen to date
[1:25:42] here you know have you seen has anyone
[1:25:47] seen the video of of their big massive
[1:25:48] rocket that the guy who does the
[1:25:50] electric cars biggest biggest cargo
[1:25:53] spaceship billions of dollars goes up in
[1:25:58] the booster rockets come down and they
[1:26:00] and they and they actually come back to
[1:26:02] earth and they just land like this
[1:26:04] malt and and to just just to get a lot
[1:26:07] of biggest cargo rocket ever to go up
[1:26:09] into space it's impressive but look how
[1:26:14] broken the world is a man can land a
[1:26:17] rocket like this and reuse it but the
[1:26:20] world is more broken than it's ever been
[1:26:22] it's heading for a nuclear nuclear war
[1:26:24] that's insanity of all man can do and
[1:26:29] nothing against those things this world
[1:26:31] is broken because they try to do the
[1:26:34] same old thing and people are so blind
[1:26:37] they will you know we come to church
[1:26:41] Wednesday Sunday in a total about maybe
[1:26:46] five or six hours a week and people will
[1:26:49] sit in front of a screen for six hours a
[1:26:53] day and they're being preached to they
[1:26:57] are actually those those movies they
[1:27:00] watch you know the songs and they and
[1:27:03] it's not just here not just video audio
[1:27:05] that's every moment of every day and
[1:27:08] they're listening to music and they're
[1:27:09] watching and they're actually being
[1:27:11] preached to a message is being told to
[1:27:14] them and they begin to become what they
[1:27:17] hear they're far more devout than a lot
[1:27:22] of us because we don't have church 24/7
[1:27:25] like they do and they're becoming and
[1:27:28] it's the same thing and as blindness
[1:27:31] coming in
[1:27:31] it's a blindness and it's the same thing
[1:27:34] in the religious world
[1:27:35] it's a blindness why is that because the
[1:27:38] anointing that was on those two angels
[1:27:40] they're still here and it just blinds
[1:27:42] the people they can't find the door
[1:27:43] doesn't matter what they do but in this
[1:27:46] age we're called to go receive ICF that
[1:27:49] we would see without manual price here's
[1:27:53] the isafe hallelujah this word give I
[1:27:56] pray this word has opened eyes
[1:27:58] this message is become a living reality
[1:28:00] we see everything the proper was talking
[1:28:03] about has become manifested in the cell
[1:28:04] he's actually telling you this is where
[1:28:06] you are before the burning of Sodom
[1:28:09] there was a visitation of God to a
[1:28:12] people waiting a promise
[1:28:15] yes this is your last song the Messiah
[1:28:20] is standing on the platform now you say
[1:28:22] well this is all rather elitism and so
[1:28:24] on no it's not this is God's promise for
[1:28:27] the Aged just be happy if you're and be
[1:28:30] happy and then have a burden for those
[1:28:32] who are out amen
[1:28:36] now she's got varicose veins this is
[1:28:43] whereas where is he born King of the
[1:28:46] Jews
[1:28:47] have you ever thought about was he asked
[1:28:49] these questions because he's actually
[1:28:52] saying here he is now that God the one
[1:28:56] you listen to on tape he hasn't left
[1:28:58] he's present are we aware of his
[1:29:01] presence or do we just sit there and
[1:29:04] just let the devil take our thought
[1:29:05] pattern off someplace
[1:29:08] you know is everyone here today you say
[1:29:12] well I'm here but I embody I'm here but
[1:29:14] in spirit I'm I'm somewhere else don't
[1:29:17] let the devil do that to you take you
[1:29:19] down something garden path and then I'm
[1:29:21] about to close and now you're here amen
[1:29:23] glory I'm so happy that's over
[1:29:26] where are you friends don't let this
[1:29:29] world pass us by don't leave this pass
[1:29:31] you by the woman who had the blood issue
[1:29:34] she had one chance but God is Grace he
[1:29:38] was the fullness of grace and truth and
[1:29:40] he was walking he was on his way to
[1:29:42] Calvary
[1:29:43] blind bartimaeus the same way that was
[1:29:44] there on the opportunity there recorded
[1:29:47] in the scripture because they called out
[1:29:48] well they see if I can just touch the
[1:29:50] hem of His garment I'll be made whole
[1:29:52] they pressed it and got what they needed
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] and it's got to be the same this world
[1:29:58] is lukewarm did he say well of course it
[1:30:01] is but don't let that lukewarmness
[1:30:04] affect your spiritual walk amen don't
[1:30:08] let it bother you
[1:30:09] in that way we have to live in this
[1:30:11] world but don't let it overtake you and
[1:30:15] syrahs she's got verrico so we'll go
[1:30:18] back and see her inside not out loud but
[1:30:20] the Bible said within herself said me
[1:30:23] being an old woman have a hundred years
[1:30:24] old and and having pleasure with my Lord
[1:30:26] Abraham she loved him
[1:30:28] now you women ought to love your
[1:30:29] husband's like that because the Bible
[1:30:31] said so that's right so much he called
[1:30:33] him Lord
[1:30:33] but then he lived a life to actually
[1:30:35] merit that that little word Lord now and
[1:30:38] when they she did that see if you love
[1:30:42] your husband's like that and you'll
[1:30:44] honor and love your wife the divorce
[1:30:45] courts will go out of business that's
[1:30:47] the way it should be for what God has
[1:30:49] joined together let no man put asunder
[1:30:51] she's got varicose veins now now he's
[1:30:54] calling out someone she's a mother of a
[1:30:56] big bunch of children doesn't she that's
[1:30:58] exactly right your name is mrs. Ellis
[1:31:00] Thompson that's exactly right returned
[1:31:03] receive what you've asked for so shall
[1:31:06] she be healed because you have believed
[1:31:08] on the Lord Jesus now if we're strangers
[1:31:10] to me to me another wave your hand back
[1:31:14] and forth like this I don't know you
[1:31:16] know nothing about you I challenge your
[1:31:18] faith I believe it he a challenge any
[1:31:20] person in here in the name of Jesus
[1:31:21] Christ to believe in as presence is here
[1:31:24] I don't care what's wrong with you if
[1:31:27] you'll believe it remember this is the
[1:31:29] last thing that he'll do before his
[1:31:31] coming you remember what he said as it
[1:31:34] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so
[1:31:37] shall have been the coming of the Son of
[1:31:38] man and then many places he sees now
[1:31:41] I'll turn my back Sarah was in the tent
[1:31:45] was in the tent behind him he says now
[1:31:48] I'll turn my back to the person and he
[1:31:51] begins to say exactly what's wrong
[1:31:52] what's wrong with the person and what's
[1:31:54] their name and their address and
[1:31:55] everything why did he do that he wasn't
[1:31:57] doing it as a show he said I've heard
[1:31:59] these things for years I pray means a
[1:32:01] little bit more to you today and then he
[1:32:05] says now I'll turn my back he's not
[1:32:06] doing as a show but he's doing it that
[1:32:08] he's saying what you read about in
[1:32:10] Genesis 18 is being lived out here and
[1:32:13] the reason that their ministry was now
[1:32:15] being repeated again as there's a people
[1:32:18] upon the earth that are being called out
[1:32:19] they're not stuck in a religious Sodom
[1:32:22] and Gomorrah blinded they can't find the
[1:32:24] door but they've been called out amen
[1:32:27] and God is visiting us that our hearts
[1:32:30] will be turned from doubt to faith
[1:32:32] hallelujah you may be sitting here
[1:32:34] doubting the promise of God can it
[1:32:36] really happen can it really be me
[1:32:38] I pray God turn your heart to faith
[1:32:41] you are fully persuaded that he is able
[1:32:43] to perform that which he has promised
[1:32:46] you olya doesn't matter about someone
[1:32:48] else what about you
[1:32:50] amen you got to see it as that
[1:32:54] hallelujah
[1:32:56] Sarah's heart was turned Sarah's heart
[1:33:00] was stirred from doubt to faith and then
[1:33:03] she believed then now she believed it
[1:33:07] and then they received the promised son
[1:33:10] and this is where the churches today we
[1:33:13] have come to believe the promise of God
[1:33:15] have we not I mean we know I pray I no
[1:33:18] longer doubt the promise hallelujah I
[1:33:21] fully are persuaded this is his word
[1:33:23] that he is send in the same time amen
[1:33:27] and we are not here we are not here
[1:33:31] friends stuck in a religious Sodom he
[1:33:33] said well that's judgmental to them no
[1:33:35] these two groups lot still receive
[1:33:37] salvation hey with me Lord still receive
[1:33:40] salvation
[1:33:41] they'll have their place but what about
[1:33:43] your place what about you this message
[1:33:46] is a bride call the and what does that
[1:33:49] mean it's a call to gather a people to
[1:33:52] unite them with Jesus Christ the
[1:33:55] bridegroom hallelujah and he can't lose
[1:33:58] his wife amen he can't lose a part of
[1:34:02] himself I will just read this in him
[1:34:06] that will close this day the scripture
[1:34:09] Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in
[1:34:11] a corruption the whole thing nation
[1:34:13] against nation earthquakes in diverse
[1:34:15] places we are diverse places great world
[1:34:18] ones coming down and shaking the nations
[1:34:20] and so forth great disasters everywhere
[1:34:23] this day the Scriptures fulfilled just I
[1:34:25] just pause for a second has anyone seen
[1:34:27] the video on the Alaskan earthquake the
[1:34:30] Good Friday Alaskan earthquake
[1:34:31] have you seen go see the video on it you
[1:34:34] know do you know why that happened a
[1:34:37] prophet God has to do something upon the
[1:34:40] earth he is a prophet to start things
[1:34:42] just like Moses you know throw dust on
[1:34:46] the air or raise up your staff and let
[1:34:48] frogs or flies or worry will come so
[1:34:50] brother brems there and and God says
[1:34:53] pick up a
[1:34:54] he picks it up and a whirlwind comes
[1:34:57] down and it blasts out the canyon wall
[1:34:59] everything Sabino Canyon and it cuts out
[1:35:01] all these triangle-shaped rocks have you
[1:35:03] has anyone seen any of those they are
[1:35:05] actually pyramid shaped and there's and
[1:35:08] it's and it's - two kinds of rockets
[1:35:10] like a brown and they're like a dark
[1:35:11] grey rock on the inside pyramidal shape
[1:35:13] and then and then that will one goes off
[1:35:17] and then the people are going who are
[1:35:19] hunting with him saying what's going on
[1:35:21] he sees his judgment striking the west
[1:35:24] coast and shortly after that there was
[1:35:27] the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska and
[1:35:32] he said that'll start that started and
[1:35:34] it will continue on the great until they
[1:35:37] know the world has ended we've gone into
[1:35:40] a judgement cycle do you understand this
[1:35:42] world is already in a judgement cycle a
[1:35:45] pre-tribulation judgment just doesn't
[1:35:48] it's like the days of Noah God tells
[1:35:50] Noah build the ark I'm going to flood
[1:35:52] the earth what's happening the world is
[1:35:54] going into a judgement cycle one hundred
[1:35:56] twenty years but there's mercy there's a
[1:35:59] way of escape for a hundred and twenty
[1:36:01] years before the judgment finally falls
[1:36:05] hallelujah but it the world had gone
[1:36:07] into a judgement cycle and so here we
[1:36:09] are this world is in a judgement cycle I
[1:36:12] mean the tribulation is coming and that
[1:36:16] is according to the Word of God it is
[1:36:17] coming but before it sits in just like
[1:36:20] Sodom was going to burn but before it
[1:36:22] burned God was dealing with Abraham God
[1:36:26] sent angels to pull that out before the
[1:36:28] destruction and it's the same thing
[1:36:30] today this world is going to burn no one
[1:36:34] can stop it
[1:36:35] someone will push a button and it
[1:36:38] doesn't matter who boasts I've got a
[1:36:39] bigger nuclear button than you it
[1:36:41] doesn't matter it's gonna it's going to
[1:36:44] go and it's not just going to be a will
[1:36:47] push and we'll fire one and see what
[1:36:48] happens no nuclear war is different
[1:36:52] you've got to annihilate your enemy
[1:36:54] before it annihilate you that's why you
[1:36:58] can't just have a skirmish here and a
[1:36:59] skirmish here and a battlefront here
[1:37:01] it's nothing to do with tanks jets and
[1:37:02] bombers it's missiles and they have to
[1:37:06] completely wipe out their enemy
[1:37:07] you think of America and Russia and
[1:37:09] China they have a big dust-up with their
[1:37:11] nuclear weapons it's not just gonna be
[1:37:13] our fire one and see what happens if
[1:37:15] they'll surrender they take out all
[1:37:16] their cities all their silos all their
[1:37:19] nuclear subs anything that can hit them
[1:37:22] back they've got to wipe it out and one
[1:37:25] go that's different
[1:37:27] we've never had that kind of thing going
[1:37:29] on it's going to happen but before the
[1:37:32] first bomb drops the bride is gone amen
[1:37:35] that's what that's what the prophecies
[1:37:36] and I happen to believe it now but you
[1:37:39] see the world has gone to a judgement
[1:37:41] cycle you know how there's the cloud
[1:37:43] that appeared on sunset mountain supreme
[1:37:45] judge Jesus Christ was there now that's
[1:37:48] just not now he's come to judge the
[1:37:50] earth
[1:37:50] he's also come to judge is bright and
[1:37:53] there's not in a negative way but a
[1:37:55] judge just doesn't condemn me pardons
[1:37:58] amen he doesn't just condemn he pardons
[1:38:00] so there's some there's some where
[1:38:03] there's some in the courtroom where the
[1:38:05] judge becomes the attorney and the case
[1:38:08] is settled
[1:38:09] hallelujah I mean there's some on the
[1:38:12] corner of endless is the courtroom so
[1:38:14] depends has your judge become you're
[1:38:16] returning as the Word of God become your
[1:38:19] attorney or is it just your judge it
[1:38:21] depends your attitude your brother
[1:38:23] oversees a statement I wish I had it up
[1:38:25] here your attitude towards the word
[1:38:29] determines your eternal destination your
[1:38:33] attitude towards the word determines
[1:38:37] your eternal destination your attitude
[1:38:41] do you love him
[1:38:43] do you love his word and say Lord
[1:38:45] whatever your wood says I'll do it
[1:38:47] because I love you or is it no I don't
[1:38:50] care about it it doesn't matter to me
[1:38:52] anymore
[1:38:52] I'll do what I want what's your attitude
[1:38:56] there's only two places your attitude
[1:38:59] you say yes Lord or null do it some
[1:39:01] other time there are people around the
[1:39:03] ark I may see it I'll do it some other
[1:39:04] time
[1:39:04] and God close the door no it didn't
[1:39:07] close the door do you think anyone wants
[1:39:09] mercy to be over we want to say come
[1:39:13] quickly a little bit at the same time
[1:39:14] like well there's a lot of people out
[1:39:17] here and they're just like us so no yeah
[1:39:21] so uh no wouldn't have closed the door
[1:39:22] himself I don't believe if he could have
[1:39:25] that God closed the door it's done but
[1:39:28] your judge your attitude towards the
[1:39:31] Word of God will determine your eternal
[1:39:33] destination and so now he has come the
[1:39:38] supreme judge to judge the world but
[1:39:41] also to pardon his bride that she never
[1:39:43] did it in the first place so we're at a
[1:39:47] judgment cycle but there's mercy even in
[1:39:50] judgment they meant like we have some
[1:39:53] musicians I think we're just in there
[1:39:59] this day the Scriptures fulfilled
[1:40:16] maybe a bit heavy when you think about
[1:40:18] it serous heart was stirred from death
[1:40:22] to faith by visitation of God and I pray
[1:40:26] that's why God would visit us here is
[1:40:32] that our hearts will be turned to faith
[1:40:35] not in doubt but to faith in the promise
[1:40:39] amen
[1:40:41] they sing that song in its manifesting
[1:40:43] time because the fruits are on the vine
[1:40:46] I see it about being in a judgement
[1:40:50] cycle we could understand we live in a
[1:40:54] time who of us are about 80 years old no
[1:40:59] one no 80 literally literally 80 years
[1:41:02] old yeah so they would know what it's
[1:41:05] like from when the world was actually in
[1:41:08] relatively one piece to what it is now
[1:41:11] they would know because they live in
[1:41:13] that era now they live in this era none
[1:41:15] of us live back in that era amen none of
[1:41:19] us did
[1:41:19] we are living at a time when the world
[1:41:21] has already fallen apart so we would
[1:41:23] look at and say what do you mean we've
[1:41:24] got society we've got culture we've got
[1:41:27] technology and you're saying the world
[1:41:29] was falling apart look at what we have
[1:41:31] but we never look back there when it was
[1:41:35] easy to get health care and I mean
[1:41:37] different it was a lot easy to get
[1:41:38] things there things were more affordable
[1:41:40] back then you know well as your granddad
