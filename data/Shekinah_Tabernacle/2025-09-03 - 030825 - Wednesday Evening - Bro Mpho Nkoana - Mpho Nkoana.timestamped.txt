[3:19] Praise the Lord. Good evening.
[3:22] God bless you all this evening.
[3:25] Let's um let's stand and um just get our
[3:29] minds into an atmosphere that we can
[3:31] receive the word of God uh this evening
[3:33] that we can just lay aside any
[3:37] uh thoughts that that would not move us
[3:41] forward. There's a lot of thoughts we
[3:43] can get throughout the day that are not
[3:45] designed to move us forward in our
[3:46] Christian walk.
[3:48] They're designed to do the opposite.
[3:50] Some are designed to really just help us
[3:51] function as a human being. I think I
[3:53] should go there and pick up that or I
[3:55] think I should probably go and get some
[3:57] dinner. But you know, even in those
[3:58] thoughts, the Lord still controls all
[4:00] those. You know, you think, "No, you
[4:02] know what? I'll do this. I'll I'll do
[4:04] this first, then in about 20 minutes,
[4:07] I'll go and to the shop and get
[4:08] something." And then when you go to the
[4:10] shop, you'll meet someone that's right
[4:11] there just at that time. So that thought
[4:13] you got was from the Lord to make you,
[4:15] you know, meet certain people and do
[4:17] certain things. It's called divine
[4:18] appointments. But tonight, we want to
[4:21] let the thoughts of the Lord speak to us
[4:24] and let let his thoughts come in and
[4:26] just minister minister to us this
[4:28] evening. So, let's um let's just pray.
[4:30] Heavenly Father, we thank you. We thank
[4:32] you that we can be here this evening,
[4:34] Lord, and we can receive your word into
[4:36] our hearts and we can put on the mind of
[4:38] Christ, Lord, and we can lay aside other
[4:40] things that would maybe bring us to a
[4:43] different place that wouldn't be a place
[4:44] of faith, Lord. Lord, it wouldn't be a
[4:46] place of love or a place of Lord of of
[4:48] of victory. We want to lay aside those
[4:51] thoughts, Lord, and we just want to
[4:52] focus our minds upon you this evening,
[4:55] Lord, that you could speak to us and
[4:56] that you can minister to our hearts,
[4:58] Lord, and that you just bring peace and
[4:59] love and joy in our midst, Lord, and and
[5:02] just may there be a victory and a joy in
[5:04] the camp this evening. We thank you that
[5:05] we can meet here together. We've got
[5:06] this building and there's brethren here
[5:08] that we can meet with, Lord. And so, we
[5:09] just want to um lay hold upon it and
[5:11] just make the most of this evening. We
[5:12] just pray and just commit it to your
[5:13] hands in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the
[5:16] Lord. We're going to sing. They were
[5:17] gathered in the upper room. All praying
[5:18] in his name.
[5:24] They were gathered in the upper room.
[5:27] All praying in his name. They were
[5:30] baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[5:32] powerful service came. And now what he
[5:36] did for them that day, he'll do for you
[5:38] the same. Well, I'm so glad that I can
[5:41] say I'm one of them.
[5:44] One of them.
[5:47] One of them.
[5:49] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of

[5:57] One of them.
[6:00] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[6:03] them.
[6:05] Though these people may not learn to be
[6:07] nor boast of worldly fame, they have all
[6:11] received their Pentecost baptized in
[6:14] Jesus' name. And I'm telling now both
[6:17] far and wide. His power is yet the same.

[6:43] them.
[6:45] There are people almost everywhere whose
[6:48] hearts are all a flame. With the fire
[6:51] that fell at pent, he cast it, cleansed,
[6:54] and made them clean. Oh, is burning now
[6:57] within my heart. Oh, glory to his name.
[7:00] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[7:03] them.

[7:08] One of them.
[7:11] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[7:14] them.
[7:16] One of them.
[7:18] One of them.
[7:21] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[7:24] them.
[7:26] Come my brother, seek this blessing that
[7:28] will cleanse your heart from sin. That
[7:31] will start the joy bells ringing and
[7:33] will keep your soul a flame. Oh, he's
[7:36] burning now within my heart. Oh, glory
[7:40] to his name. I'm so glad that I can say
[7:43] I'm one of them.
[7:46] I'm one of the
[7:49] one of them.
[7:51] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[7:54] them.

[8:04] them. I'm one of them. One of them.

[8:14] them.

[8:25] them.
[8:27] Amen. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[8:29] of them.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. This next song is called the Alas
[8:32] are call. I used to hate this song when
[8:34] I was young
[8:37] cuz my brothers would nudge me when the
[8:39] Isaac part came on. Isaac getting a
[8:41] wife.
[8:45] It was early in the morning by an
[8:48] ancient wayside well. Alaza stopped to
[8:52] rest his camel train.
[8:55] He had found a bride for Isaac. He had
[8:58] found Rebecca fair. And his weary
[9:01] journey had not been in vain. So get
[9:05] ready. So get ready. Evening shadows
[9:10] fall. I have heard the alley are call.
[9:15] There is going to be a wedding. How joy
[9:19] will soon be full in the evening when
[9:22] the camel train comes in.
[9:26] Now the blessed holy spirit from the
[9:29] father God above has come down to earth
[9:32] to claim his worthy bride.
[9:36] And our eyes that go over yonder has
[9:39] prepared his tent of love. And he wants
[9:42] his Rebecca by his side.
[9:46] Wo. So get ready.
[9:50] Shadows fall. I have heard the alias are
[9:54] calling.
[9:57] There is going to be a way. How joy will
[10:00] soon be full in the evening when the
[10:04] camel train comes in.
[10:06] But we have left our chin. For gladly we
[10:10] have bid the world goodbye. We've been
[10:12] called to be his pure and spotless
[10:15] bride.
[10:17] And we'll soon behold our eyes in their
[10:20] blessed eternity. What a happy happy
[10:24] wedding that will be. So get ready. So
[10:29] get ready. Evening shadows fall.
[10:33] I have heard the alley are cold.
[10:38] There is going to be a wedding. How joy
[10:41] will soon be full in the evening when
[10:45] the camel train comes in. So get ready.
[10:49] So get ready. The evening shadow fall. I
[10:55] have heard the alias of fall.
[10:59] There is going to be waiting and joy
[11:02] will soon be full in the evening when
[11:06] the camel train comes. Oh, so get ready.
[11:10] So get ready.
[11:13] Evening shadows fall.
[11:15] Oh, I have heard the alley are call.
[11:21] Oh, there is going to be a wedding. And
[11:25] our joy will soon begin.
[11:29] In the evening when the camel train come
[11:39] while I'm sailing
[11:41] [Music]
[11:43] where the stormy
[11:45] sea
[11:47] the waves are crashing over and the
[11:50] daylight hides his face from me. Fear is
[11:56] true and the storm agrees.
[12:01] But I look and I see who's in the boat
[12:06] with me. Jesus,
[12:11] you're here.
[12:14] There is nothing that I need to fear.
[12:22] You're here.
[12:25] You're here.

[12:36] There is nothing that I need to fear
[12:42] because Jesus is here. Jesus
[12:47] is here.
[12:52] Waves you won't break me. Storm you
[12:57] won't shake me.

[13:49] When the waves
[13:51] arise,
[13:53] you're still there.

[21:06] comforting thing to know that our
[21:08] redeemer lives. Amen. I greet you all
[21:11] tonight in the wonderful name of our
[21:13] Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you so much,
[21:16] brother Isaac. you know, just sit
[21:18] sitting there and just listening to the
[21:20] songs, I realized that
[21:23] uh brother Isaac is such a special
[21:25] brother. Uh to me at least,
[21:30] and I know to you, you know, the songs
[21:32] that the Lord gave him to to write down
[21:36] for his bride such I've never met anyone
[21:39] like that before. I don't mean you must
[21:41] uplift my brother.
[21:43] H it just came across to me very
[21:46] strongly my brother. I must just give
[21:48] the man the accolades while you can
[21:50] still see him in the eyes. Amen. I'm so
[21:53] blessed by his songs and uh may the Lord
[21:55] continue to bless you and for the
[21:58] benefit of his kingdom. That's my
[22:00] prayer. I've never met anyone like this.
[22:02] I was thinking sitting there say hey
[22:05] this brother Isaac I don't know
[22:08] which part of the body you know any what
[22:12] organ what what part of the body can I
[22:15] associate with him what do you think
[22:17] Isaac will be
[22:21] what do you think Isaac can be
[22:25] you know eyes head liver toe but
[22:30] he's such a a blessing to me. Oh,
[22:32] fingers.
[22:35] Brother Ed says fingers.
[22:37] You know, he does he does things. What?
[22:40] Can I tell you my answer? What was my
[22:41] answer for me? I thought feet. Isaac
[22:44] walks. He just what whatever the
[22:46] situation is, he walk. Sorry, my
[22:48] brother. I don't mean to put you on the
[22:50] spot. But whatever the situation, son,
[22:53] rain, low down, walk. Just walk.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; You are a winner. Just keep on walking.
[22:59] Thank you, brother Isaac. I really
[23:01] appreciate it. Maybe I may not have
[23:02] another chance to tell you, but keep on
[23:05] doing, brother. And I'm not saying he
[23:08] doesn't have weaknesses. He's my young
[23:10] brother. I'm sure he won't mind saying
[23:12] this, but he's got weaknesses. Many of
[23:15] them. Maybe some of them you don't know.
[23:17] But we look at the blessing and the
[23:19] gift. And that's what I appreciate so
[23:22] much. So, thank you so much, my brother.
[23:25] Appreciate it. Thank you musicians. And
[23:26] you, too.
[23:29] You're such a blessing. God bless you.
[23:30] You may take your seats and then uh we
[23:34] are going to read the scripture. Thank
[23:35] you. I just thought I should pass that.
[23:38] It was it was in my heart. Sorry to put
[23:40] brother Isaac on the spot.
[23:43] Um no one can believe if I can tell you
[23:46] that I was very sick last night. Maybe
[23:49] brother Ed.
[23:51] I didn't I didn't think that I'll come
[23:54] and preach again because I was very very
[23:56] very sick. The enemy wanted me to be
[23:59] down
[24:01] and uh but I
[24:04] I refused. I refused to be sick. I just
[24:08] refused. I refused and I refused and
[24:11] through the night I was sick and I was
[24:13] and I refused. So here am I.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; So I thank the Lord for that. And while
[24:19] we standing let's read a scripture in
[24:20] Genesis chapter 3 verse 9. while we
[24:23] standing.
[24:32] I didn't want to postpone preaching for
[24:34] the third time.
[24:41] Genesis chapter 3. Once you're there,
[24:43] just say amen.
[24:47] Verse 9.
[24:49] This is when the Lord was
[24:52] looking for Adam.
[24:55] And and the Lord called Adam and I mean
[24:58] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[25:02] said unto him, "Where are thou?"
[25:06] In today's language, we say, "Where are
[25:08] you, Adam? Where are you?" I'm sure we
[25:13] don't think we don't believe the Lord
[25:14] did not know where Adam was,
[25:17] but he's asking where are you. Let's
[25:20] pray. If you've got a need, maybe you
[25:23] can just show the Lord by the lifting up
[25:25] your heart or your hand and just say,
[25:28] "Lord, speak to me. Lord, answer me.
[25:32] Lord, address me." Heavenly Father, we
[25:34] thank you tonight for your loving grace.
[25:36] We thank you, Lord, for your loving
[25:38] kindness. We thank you for your
[25:40] presence. We thank you for the word that
[25:42] we have read. We invite you master that
[25:44] you come and speak and interpret your
[25:47] word. We invite you tonight that you
[25:49] come and inspire your word Lord. Not
[25:52] much about the vessel Lord. Lord Jesus
[25:54] is about you. I pray tonight that you
[25:57] come in a mighty way Lord and just
[25:59] inspire both hearer and both speaker
[26:03] alike. Let your will be done tonight
[26:05] even as we stand in your presence. We
[26:07] say Lord forgive us where we have gone
[26:09] wrong in our ways. As human beings we
[26:11] air many times and I pray that you have
[26:14] mercy on us and wash us clean. Let us be
[26:16] focused on your word and what you have
[26:18] done for us. I pray for each one even
[26:20] the uplifted hands Lord. May you provide
[26:23] the desire and the need Lord God that is
[26:25] behind that hand. We ask and pray
[26:28] humbling ourselves in the name of our
[26:30] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:32] Please enjoy the comfort of your seats.
[26:35] Um
[26:37] I don't have a PowerPoint sister Talia
[26:40] but uh I do have a a little word
[26:42] document that I have prepared here and
[26:45] uh so
[26:48] um
[26:50] we I want to speak about the thought or
[26:54] the title that says
[26:57] position
[26:58] affecting possession.
[27:01] position affecting possession.
[27:06] That's what I want to talk about this
[27:07] evening. And just a little thought and
[27:10] then we can pray and go home. Now we we
[27:15] read about Adam and the Lord asking
[27:19] where are thou?
[27:22] So Adam has lost a position.
[27:28] The Lord was asking him where are you
[27:30] because I put you on position one for
[27:33] example I put you on position one in
[27:36] other words the Lord was saying why are
[27:38] you now in position 51
[27:41] I put you here why are you there where
[27:44] are you you know the coach in a football
[27:47] match when they put you as a striker
[27:51] which means you'll be in the vicinity of
[27:53] the goal post of your opponent in that
[27:56] vicinity Imagine
[27:58] a striker sitting at the back line. The
[28:01] coach will say, "Where are thou?"
[28:05] That's what the coach will say because
[28:07] you are positioned to be the striker.
[28:12] When the back line on the middle passes
[28:15] the ball
[28:16] to the striker, the striker is out of
[28:19] position.
[28:21] Why are thou?
[28:23] That's what God was asking. I want to
[28:26] read for you what the prophet says here
[28:27] just before we something says
[28:31] before we proceed. Let me just read a
[28:33] quotation for you. Brother Brenham in
[28:36] the message
[28:38] of the position of a believer in Christ
[28:42] preached in 55 February the 27th.
[28:46] He says, "Now that's what we are trying
[28:48] to do today
[28:51] is to place the believer in his right
[28:54] position
[28:56] so he can see where he is at."
[29:00] Did you Oh, it's the back. Sorry, I
[29:02] forgot the sauce. Sorry, I didn't mean
[29:05] to take your attention. I was just
[29:07] concerned what the speaker or what the
[29:09] the prophet is saying. The reason why we
[29:11] come here and preach, the reason why the
[29:13] whole sermons, the whole preaching, the
[29:15] whole everything we are talking to
[29:17] encourage you is to try to put the
[29:21] believer in their right position. Is to
[29:25] try to to to to to make you aware of
[29:29] your rightful position and where you are
[29:32] actually are
[29:34] &gt;&gt; so that you shouldn't be in the wrong
[29:35] position or you shouldn't be at the
[29:37] right at the wrong place at the wrong
[29:39] time.
[29:41] you know that the to so that's that's
[29:43] just what the purpose of the sermon is
[29:46] tonight
[29:48] that's what you hear brother Ben coming
[29:50] here preaching Sunday in Sunday out
[29:53] Wednesday in Wednesday out with the rest
[29:55] of the ministers the purpose is to try
[29:59] to place the believer in during the
[30:02] minister
[30:06] in the right position and for them to
[30:09] know where they at.
[30:11] Think about it this way. Or maybe before
[30:14] we go there, let's just before we bring
[30:17] that aspect of thinking about where you
[30:19] are at, let's just look at what what
[30:21] actually is a position. Then what is a
[30:24] position? According to Oxford
[30:26] dictionary,
[30:28] it says a position is where is a place
[30:31] where someone or something is located or
[30:36] has been put. That's a position. For
[30:39] example, you cannot approve something
[30:41] that you are not in position to
[30:43] authorize in the position to authorize.
[30:47] If not your it's not your place. You
[30:50] know the talk that says no it's not your
[30:52] place to do that. We we often tell oh no
[30:55] sister that is not your place brother
[30:57] that is not your in other words there
[30:59] it's not you're not in position to do
[31:02] that. I can't just stand on the road now
[31:04] and start stopping the cars.
[31:08] I'm not in position to do that. It's not
[31:10] my position. And without a position, I
[31:13] have no authority.
[31:15] Without a position, I have no
[31:19] not only authority, I have no blessings.
[31:22] I have because I'm out of my position.
[31:28] Position has got a lot to do with your
[31:31] possession. You'll see now.
[31:35] In fact, I wrote here, everyone has the
[31:38] authority to do to achieve anything.
[31:40] Anyone you can achieve it, but the only
[31:43] things that just be in your position,
[31:46] you'll see you'll achieve.
[31:48] If you're out of position because it's
[31:51] not about
[31:53] it's not about position is not about how
[31:55] able you are. It's not about how capable
[31:59] you are.
[32:01] That's not what position is all about.
[32:02] We can hear that you are qualified. You
[32:04] are skilled and you are able. You are
[32:06] strong. We can hear that you are more
[32:08] than capable. But is it in your
[32:10] position?
[32:12] You understand what I'm trying to say?
[32:13] But the context anyone can do anything.
[32:16] In fact, a Christian can do anything.
[32:19] Everything if you are in the right
[32:20] position, you can do it because you are
[32:22] in your right position. So position can
[32:25] be viewed in many different context and
[32:28] all those context explain the position
[32:32] and what comes when you are in your
[32:34] right position.
[32:36] That's why the Lord just gave me that
[32:38] inspiration to talk about brother Isaac
[32:39] because
[32:42] think about the part of a body. I spoke
[32:44] about this many times. The parts of the
[32:46] body if another part takes another
[32:48] part's job it loses its position. It
[32:52] will even die that part because it's
[32:54] doing another part's job. It will lose
[32:57] his reward. It will lose his blessings.
[32:59] it will lose everything all his
[33:01] possessions because it loses the
[33:04] position. That's that's that's my
[33:06] message tonight.
[33:09] So,
[33:10] let's just
[33:12] then go to
[33:17] let's go to
[33:19] I'm laughing because of so many examples
[33:21] that I wrote here. The one it says here,
[33:23] can you hold this as an example of
[33:26] position? Can you hold this nail in
[33:28] position while I hammer?
[33:34] You see, position is very important. If
[33:36] that nail cannot be in position and you
[33:40] hold it and I hammer
[33:45] can you imagine what what can happen.
[33:48] So that's why I was laughing. Position
[33:50] my children is very important.
[33:53] It's not positioned in terms of number
[33:55] one, number two, number five. No, no.
[33:58] It's It says here it is a place
[34:03] where someone or something is located
[34:09] or has been put that is a position not
[34:13] number one or I come second or I come
[34:15] third. No, no. That's a that's position
[34:17] of children uh who who are arguing who
[34:21] should take the bigger plate first or
[34:23] I'm the first born I must I'm position
[34:25] one no that that's a wrong position I'm
[34:28] talking about where you are placed at
[34:31] right what is possession then
[34:35] possession according to
[34:38] this time I didn't check the Oxford
[34:39] dictionary I checked the other one that
[34:41] start with M
[34:44] m something. The state of having or
[34:48] owning or controlling something
[34:51] they say is possession.
[34:53] the state of owning, having or
[34:56] controlling something. Again, let me
[34:58] bring rugby this time. In rugby, when we
[35:01] play two two,
[35:04] why why don't we play four four four
[35:07] groups at a time,
[35:10] why don't we play two I mean I mean four
[35:13] teams in the in the match and each one
[35:17] wants to win. Why don't we do that?
[35:20] Because there's only two powers. All
[35:22] these things that we see daily, we see
[35:24] them.
[35:28] Every game is about two sides. You can
[35:31] be many players. Even in tennis, it can
[35:34] be two two, but at the end it's two
[35:36] sides.
[35:38] 20 players 10 10. So, so in in rugby we
[35:43] play and then they say, "Oh, they've got
[35:45] their possession. They've got enough
[35:47] ball possession." Is it is that
[35:50] something like that? Yeah. or even in
[35:52] soccer is there. They even write on the
[35:54] screen there. Oh, football group A has
[35:56] got 50 51% ball possession. The others
[35:59] have got 49. They're owning the
[36:01] possession. But you know, did you know
[36:04] that they can lose a game
[36:07] even with the higher 60% ball
[36:10] possession?
[36:11] &gt;&gt; They can lose a game. But how come how
[36:13] come brother they can lose a game when
[36:15] they they're leading? They've got a
[36:17] possession. They dominate. No, no. You
[36:20] see, possession goes with position.
[36:25] If they are in possession of the game,
[36:29] but they lose their positions,
[36:34] they can lose.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Very likely it happens, isn't it, Jono?
[36:38] Doesn't it happen? Just one mistake, the
[36:41] opponent get a a a a try and you're gone
[36:45] with your ball position,
[36:47] right? So you must be able to maintain
[36:50] your position in order to have your
[36:53] possessions with you all the time. They
[36:57] are yours. The possessions are yours.
[37:00] I'm not taking them from you. All
[37:02] healing, all everything God's blessings
[37:05] because he pre-ordained them for you.
[37:08] They yours. I can take them. but be in
[37:11] the right position to access them to use
[37:13] them to to to to let them manifest what
[37:16] they were meant to do to bring right
[37:19] does it make sense can I hear the amen
[37:22] there at the back
[37:24] &gt;&gt; I'll call for the front very soon
[37:27] excuse me so what happens when you lose
[37:30] a position
[37:32] what happens because you see a position
[37:35] h Adam lost it
[37:39] by
[37:41] by ignoring or disregarding the word of
[37:43] God. That's what happened to Adam. And
[37:46] he lost. He was even kicked out of the
[37:48] garden as you all know. Why did that
[37:52] mean that Adam was no more a son of God?
[37:54] No. He's he's a son of God with full
[37:57] possession but he lost his position and
[38:00] that led to him from to lose some of his
[38:03] possessions.
[38:05] That is why Jesus Christ today has come
[38:08] back as the second Adam to restore
[38:11] those possessions and he can only do
[38:14] that by restoring himself to the
[38:16] position and us to our rightful position
[38:19] so that we access our possessions fully.
[38:21] That's why
[38:24] Adam lost it. Let's let's let's let's
[38:27] look at Abraham. Do you know Abraham?
[38:30] Abraham also at some point lost a point
[38:33] lost a a a position and he even lied a
[38:36] prophet of God.
[38:38] But that did not change him from being a
[38:40] prophet or from being God's best friend.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; But just to lose don't lose your
[38:45] position. There's a song that says oh
[38:47] that one says don't lose your vision. I
[38:49] almost conf I almost put a new word.
[38:54] Abraham,
[38:57] he even took his wife and gave it to
[38:59] another man.
[39:01] Hey, how can you get so low the the
[39:06] prophet of God?
[39:08] But because once the son of God, you are
[39:10] always, you see, that's the beautiful
[39:12] part of it. And God will make sure that
[39:14] for his word to to not fail, he'll bring
[39:17] you back. And that's what we are trying
[39:19] to do. That's what the message is doing.
[39:22] That's what the word of God is doing.
[39:24] Girls, boys, mothers, don't lose your
[39:27] position. And find that husband is got
[39:30] this position. You've got this. No.
[39:32] Husband and wife, each one must take
[39:34] their position. I know that's that's
[39:35] brother Ben's place to say that, but I
[39:37] can just flick it over for you to just
[39:39] to remind you that husbands and wives
[39:42] must not lose their position.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the young lines are going to
[39:46] think that ah look at them and they they
[39:49] won't learn it properly. A husband and a
[39:51] wife must be in the rightful position in
[39:54] order for their blessings and
[39:55] possessions to manifest properly or
[39:58] according to the word of God.
[40:01] But not in Ludicia. The Laudician ones
[40:04] don't want to do that. And that's the
[40:05] spirit of Ludicia. Sorry, I want to talk
[40:07] about position and position, not about
[40:10] marriage and divorce. Sorry.
[40:13] The same thing happens to to the church
[40:15] family or even the church out there. The
[40:18] reason why the church is today is
[40:20] because they have lost their position.
[40:22] That's the reason why we have so many
[40:23] denominations but they talking about the
[40:25] same Bible.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; We say we talk about the same Jesus
[40:28] Christ but we are contradicting all the
[40:32] churches.
[40:34] Now the message of the hour in the
[40:36] message that's how the shrewd he can be
[40:40] that's how shrewd he can be. He he will
[40:42] leave the denominations because he know
[40:45] they have lost position. You see when
[40:46] you lose position,
[40:52] do you know the reason they introduced
[40:54] this thing called offside in in soccer?
[40:56] Sorry, I love I love football.
[40:59] The reason they introduce this thing
[41:01] called offsite is because there's this
[41:03] player who loses a position.
[41:06] He doesn't get in position at the right
[41:08] time and he's fine offside. The two
[41:11] lines men will see him off out of
[41:14] position and they raise a flag. He's out
[41:17] of position out. Instead of scoring a
[41:20] goal, he he lost a position because he's
[41:23] he now he loses the reward of a goal. He
[41:26] would have just been online get the ball
[41:29] and score. But him he was out of
[41:31] position. Am I right fish? That's the
[41:33] rule of so I'm giving examples about so
[41:36] that I can make it practical.
[41:41] What what what happens when you lose a
[41:45] position?
[41:47] You you eat from the dust bin.
[41:50] You know a dustpin you you eat from
[41:52] there. You eat you go there and dig from
[41:56] there and eat because you have lost a
[41:58] position.
[42:00] All your possessions are gone. you I
[42:02] don't mean in a bad way but if you are
[42:04] out of your pos the rightful position is
[42:07] that you are supposed to be eating
[42:08] dinner at home or eating from the nice
[42:11] cooked meal shop but no you don't mind
[42:13] digging from the bin
[42:17] and eating maggots of the world and sin
[42:21] of the world and then come to church
[42:26] you have lost your position if you do
[42:28] that because you for have forgotten who
[42:31] you are you forgotten that you are a son
[42:33] and a daughter of God. That's why that
[42:36] boy was found eating with pigs
[42:40] &gt;&gt; because he lost his position and then he
[42:42] lost his possessions.
[42:45] Once you lose your position,
[42:49] the chances of you keeping your
[42:50] possessions is very very
[42:54] zero. You see my girl? So don't lose it.
[42:57] Don't allow
[42:59] girls. Don't allow.
[43:03] The mothers will understand me.
[43:06] The church world has also lost position.
[43:09] The message the enemy is coming strong.
[43:13] Even in the message trying to make the
[43:16] church believer, the church family, the
[43:18] bride to lose her position. That's all
[43:21] the enemy wants. Just to let you lose
[43:23] your position. then he knows he's got
[43:26] almost everything that is belong that
[43:29] belongs to you.
[43:31] Right?
[43:33] How do you get into that position of
[43:35] losing a position? How do you Let's read
[43:37] Corinthians 1 Corinthians 12.
[43:41] 1 Corinthians 12. I'll read it for you,
[43:43] but my sister can put it for us.
[43:47] I won't be long tonight because
[43:50] um my throat will will complain, brother
[43:52] Be. But This is also prayer meeting.
[43:54] I'll just keep it short then then we go.
[43:58] 1 Corinthians 12. My girl.
[44:06] For as the body is one
[44:09] and have many members and all the
[44:11] members of that one body being many are
[44:14] one body
[44:18] also. So also is Christ. Verse 13. For
[44:22] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[44:24] one body. You see it is the spirit that
[44:28] actually brings us into position in this
[44:32] body. It is the spirit. You'll see now.
[44:35] So for by one spirit we are all baptized
[44:38] into one body whether we be Jews or
[44:40] Gentiles whether we be bond or free and
[44:43] have been all made to drink into one
[44:45] into one spirit. One. For the body is
[44:49] not one member
[44:52] is many members but one spirit.
[44:56] That is why we are different. That is
[44:58] why I can't act like Ruben. I can't be
[45:00] Ruben. I can't be Mo. I can't be a a
[45:03] Lilia. I can only be me because I'm a
[45:06] I'm a I'm a part of the many membered
[45:08] body.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Right. So again that point I said at the
[45:12] beginning if I want to do Lilia's part I
[45:15] lose my position.
[45:18] And the body suffers because of me.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; I lose my position because I I I then I
[45:24] make the body to struggle
[45:26] and the body must work double because I
[45:29] lose my position and on top of that I
[45:32] lose my possession. So one spirit
[45:36] I can't try to be brother Isaac. I know
[45:38] I cannot I cannot make those songs. But
[45:40] the Lord can use the channel for him in
[45:43] order for me to benefit from his song.
[45:44] The the Lord uses that channel of that
[45:46] gift to bring that song. I benefit but I
[45:49] didn't make the song. You see how the
[45:51] body works. That's how the body of the
[45:54] Lord the same spirit one many members
[45:57] one body. H
[46:01] if the food shall say because I am not
[46:04] the hand I'm not of the body. Is it
[46:07] therefore not is therefore not of the
[46:09] body? So that's just Paul is trying to
[46:11] show us a simple a simple truth for us
[46:15] to understand our position that if we
[46:19] are keeping our position
[46:21] the body will benefit you you'll get
[46:24] your full possessions and then brother
[46:27] Brendam even says here in the message
[46:31] again of the position of a believer in
[46:34] Christ he says h look look at it bruised
[46:38] wounded to open up on his side. This is
[46:41] the first one. Yeah. Open up. Talking
[46:43] about Jesus Christ, the Roman spear in
[46:46] order that the sp the holy spirit we
[46:48] could be baptized into his body when
[46:50] they pierced him there. You see part you
[46:53] are we are partakers of his divine
[46:55] nature. So the spirit bring us to be
[46:58] partakers of his divine nature. You get
[47:01] it? Then you become a partaker after
[47:04] coming into his body. A partaker of his
[47:08] divine nature.
[47:10] Christ nature in you. So once you become
[47:14] part of this body and you are baptized
[47:16] by that spirit, you become you have a
[47:18] new nature
[47:20] and that new nature it is the nature of
[47:23] Christ in you but operating by different
[47:25] parts and different member members of
[47:27] the same body but same nature nature of
[47:30] Christ. Now, now now he says, "How can
[47:34] you cheat, steal, lie, backslide,
[47:37] procelite, everything else with the
[47:39] divine nature of Christ in you?"
[47:43] Ah, what kind? That means you don't you
[47:46] don't have that spirit if you do that.
[47:49] But God's children who are full of the
[47:52] spirit of God, they don't do those
[47:54] things because they've got a new nature.
[48:01] It is impossible for them to do that. He
[48:03] says, "Brother, it's impossible." He
[48:06] says, "Let that soak just a few minutes
[48:09] because it is right." It is impossible.
[48:12] But hey,
[48:16] do you know what is possible?
[48:18] That a believer who loses a position get
[48:22] restored back in into his position.
[48:26] It's all about imagine a woman
[48:29] who says I love you.
[48:33] There's three things about it. Love,
[48:35] faith, and surrender. Or obedience.
[48:38] Three things. Love, faith, and
[48:41] obedience.
[48:43] If she loves you, she's going to have
[48:45] faith in you, and she'll obey to you.
[48:49] Just like we as the bride, if we love
[48:53] the Lord, we believe in him, we believe
[48:56] in him and we obey him because we are
[48:59] the female part of him. We are the we
[49:02] are a clear example of how a woman
[49:04] should be to the husband. We obey. We
[49:07] have got full confidence in him. Full
[49:11] 110%
[49:14] confidence in him and we've got faith in
[49:16] him and we love him. Nobody forces us.
[49:18] We just love him because he first loved
[49:21] us. We said that before. So the prophet
[49:24] says here one spirit you are in one
[49:27] accord with your hobby the Lord Jesus
[49:30] Christ. And that's where we want to
[49:32] direct ourselves and our children and
[49:34] our whole existence to
[49:38] let's read the next quotation. Oh yeah I
[49:40] can finish off that one.
[49:43] All of our worries, our fastings, our
[49:45] stewings, our arguings, our tempers and
[49:48] all these things pass away. You see it?
[49:52] What is the fruit of the spirit? We have
[49:54] planted. You see, there's a fruit of the
[49:56] spirit and there's a gift of the spirit.
[49:59] Many times we we confuse these things
[50:02] that the the gift of the spirit then we
[50:04] think we've got the fruits. No, the
[50:08] fruit of the spirit. The Bible says uh
[50:10] what does the Bible say? Love, peace,
[50:15] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[50:18] gentleness, patience. There is those are
[50:21] the fruits of the spirit. So no matter
[50:23] what church you belong to, what you have
[50:26] done or what you have done. Did you hear
[50:29] that?
[50:31] So we must never judge people based on
[50:33] what they have done
[50:35] whether good or bad because it is a
[50:38] spirit in that person is the fruits. If
[50:41] I judge brother Isaac because he made
[50:43] 100 million songs that are so beautiful
[50:46] and I start to put him on a pedestal. I
[50:49] start to to elevate him. He's bigger
[50:51] than everyone here. When when he comes
[50:53] we all we all stand. Brother Isaac,
[50:56] can you see that is wrong? Because we
[51:00] are doing based on what our brothers
[51:03] doing. If our brother came through that
[51:05] door and he was wearing rags and
[51:06] everything, we wouldn't do that. We
[51:09] would just say, "Hey, brother Kuban,
[51:10] just
[51:11] sort that man out, please." Can you see?
[51:14] So, the same thing if someone does
[51:16] something wrong and you know it, it's
[51:18] not for me and for you to judge that
[51:20] person based on what they did or did not
[51:22] do. the spirit.
[51:25] Can you see love, longsuffering? I think
[51:28] you know all this. Anyway, I'll jump to
[51:31] the next quotation and see what I wanted
[51:33] to share with you. That's that's that's
[51:36] quotation number three.
[51:39] Excuse me. And I only have six. So, I'm
[51:43] halfway through.
[51:47] Yeah.
[51:49] So this one
[51:52] the prophet says here just trying to
[51:54] emphasize this point of our position as
[51:56] Christians and how it really connects
[51:59] with our position.
[52:02] He says here
[52:04] if you can't love your enemy no matter
[52:06] what you say about you and no matter
[52:09] what he says about you your neighbor no
[52:11] matter what he says about you if your
[52:13] heart if from your heart not with your
[52:16] lips not with your knowledge that you
[52:20] should be doing it as a Christian. No,
[52:22] no. But something in your heart makes
[52:25] you love them anyway, regardless of what
[52:28] they say. That that is then it's time
[52:32] you come to the altar. If you can't do
[52:34] that,
[52:37] it's time you come to the altar again.
[52:39] You you just never quite quite got what
[52:42] you thought you had or what really you
[52:46] should have heard.
[52:49] You see, because you want to love them
[52:51] by lips.
[52:54] Oh, I hate to say that. That's brother
[52:56] Brendon saying that. But yet, it hurt me
[52:58] to know that here's people right here
[53:01] that lives are living with me. Dot dot
[53:04] dot. And I said this morning, if I was
[53:07] hungry, maybe you are living out there
[53:10] out here in a little place with a few
[53:13] biscuits on that on the table. Your
[53:16] children hungry. You'll split them for
[53:18] me. That's right. It has me. But my
[53:21] lovely beloved friends, I don't do it to
[53:23] be indifferent. I do it because that you
[53:26] believe. I I do this because that I know
[53:30] you love me and you you have been you
[53:33] have seen the spirit of God working. And
[53:35] then in doing this and you loving me and
[53:38] me knowing what's truth and seeing a
[53:40] danger line and don't warn you of it,
[53:42] I'll become a false shepherd.
[53:46] Did you see that? The reason why he's
[53:48] saying this, he's saying if I love you,
[53:52] I will tell you
[53:54] my attitude,
[53:56] my behavior. I'll love you and I'll tell
[53:59] you with love and with compassion, with
[54:02] an intention of removing or or showing
[54:05] you what the word of God says. I won't
[54:06] just keep quiet. It is wrong not to tell
[54:09] your brother doing something. And it's
[54:11] also wrong to tell them with the wrong
[54:12] spirit.
[54:14] As Christians, we know that. So actually
[54:18] that is just a point on the side. I I
[54:20] cannot link it to the position but it
[54:23] said in the message of the position of a
[54:24] believer in Christ
[54:27] the the believer's position in Christ
[54:30] and Christ will only meet the believer.
[54:32] Now this is now it can sounds hard this
[54:34] one
[54:36] but but it's the truth.
[54:38] Maybe brother Ben will find a way
[54:42] to
[54:43] to put the syrup
[54:46] to put a syrup or or some lubrication.
[54:50] But I know you are capable by the grace
[54:52] of God to understand what the man of God
[54:54] is trying to say. It's not me. He says
[54:56] the the believer's position is in
[54:58] Christ. You see, and Christ will only
[55:02] meet the believer.
[55:04] Then it's just dot dot dot. I think it
[55:06] got cut there.
[55:08] And Christ will only meet the believer.
[55:11] Agree. He said the position of a
[55:13] believer is in Christ. And the Christ
[55:15] will only meet the believer. Dot dot
[55:17] dot. So the part got cut. You can feel
[55:21] the missing words. I don't want to feel
[55:22] it for you. But then he says the
[55:24] believer can only worship Christ as he
[55:27] is positionally placed.
[55:30] Positionally placed. You can only
[55:33] worship God. I don't believe you get it.
[55:36] I don't believe you get it. He says,
[55:37] "Brother, let me go another route. Look,
[55:42] a believer cannot worship or has no
[55:45] right to worship dot dot dot. Again, it
[55:47] got cut. No man has no man has no right
[55:52] to worship the Lord outside of being in
[55:54] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Did
[55:58] you know that? So, I'm trying to show
[56:01] you that being in your position in the
[56:04] body is so important.
[56:07] is so crucial for us to let the Lord
[56:10] show us our place in the body
[56:14] and go according to what we are
[56:17] positionally placed to do and live like
[56:20] that. Anyway, I'll pass.
[56:23] There's two classes of people. He says
[56:26] two classes. This is in the message
[56:28] manifestation of the spirit. There's you
[56:31] know what I find in traveling. I say
[56:33] this with humbleness.
[56:36] I find two classes of people. One the
[56:39] fundamental, the other one the full
[56:42] gospel.
[56:43] They are both fine fine wonderful
[56:47] classes of people. Both of them. But
[56:50] here is the trouble. The fundamental
[56:52] knows what they are position that they
[56:55] are positionally in Christ. The
[56:57] fundamentals they know
[57:00] but they don't have much faith to
[57:03] exercise it.
[57:07] I know I'm a woman. I love the Lord,
[57:12] but I don't have the faith to believe
[57:14] what he's telling me. That's the
[57:16] fundamental.
[57:19] Now, on the other hand, the full gospel,
[57:23] they've got plenty of faith.
[57:26] They've got plenty of faith, but they
[57:29] don't know what they are at
[57:33] them. them. They don't know where
[57:36] exactly they are in terms of position.
[57:39] That's what brother Brandham says. So we
[57:42] the two sides are fine, but they must
[57:46] just be combined and be found in me and
[57:49] you.
[57:55] Just like a man who's got a lot of money
[57:56] in the bank, but they don't know how to
[57:58] write a check. and the other man has got
[58:00] a lot of has got no money in the bank
[58:03] but he knows how to write the check.
[58:06] That's how it is with these two groups.
[58:08] And those groups we mustn't find with
[58:10] any of them. We must find with both of
[58:13] them inside me
[58:18] last one.
[58:22] Keep working. Just keep walking. That's
[58:24] why I thought brother Isaac is defeated.
[58:28] Footprint.
[58:29] Footprints is a position.
[58:32] Footprints. That is why I I recorded
[58:35] this week on my phone. Footprints on the
[58:37] sense of times poem. It's just so
[58:39] powerful.
[58:41] You see, we have been here with you
[58:42] seven years.
[58:45] But we have been walking on this thing
[58:48] called life.
[58:50] the sense of time.
[58:53] You're going you you're seeing our
[58:55] footsteps on the sense of time and we
[58:56] will go maybe many many years you
[58:59] haven't seen us
[59:01] hopefully not
[59:03] but you remember that one year there was
[59:05] a brother called
[59:07] there was a brother called Isaac
[59:11] and I can see his footsteps on the sense
[59:13] of time and that's what we are doing for
[59:16] one another.
[59:19] What footprints am I leaving?
[59:23] I will only leave the right footprints
[59:26] if I'm in my position.
[59:29] There's a brother who called Graeme.
[59:31] I've met him so many times. What a
[59:32] humble brother. What did his life do for
[59:35] me? How did I benefit him or how did he
[59:37] what did I get? What God meant for me to
[59:39] meet him? Because we don't meet for no
[59:41] reason. When we meet, you must know that
[59:45] that person you meet and you don't tell
[59:47] them about Jesus Christ. You may be
[59:49] seeing them for the last time.
[59:52] You may never see them.
[59:55] And he didn't tell them about the Lord.
[59:58] We are blessed. We see each other every
[1:00:00] Sunday. But life is so fast.
[1:00:04] The footsteps on the sense of time. Keep
[1:00:06] walking. Why should you keep walking?
[1:00:10] Because if you stop, you lose
[1:00:12] possession.
[1:00:14] You lose your possession. and you are
[1:00:16] very likely to lose your position. Keep
[1:00:20] walking.
[1:00:23] Let me read it for you. It's from the
[1:00:25] message called El Shadai
[1:00:29] 60 August. He says here, "No sir, they
[1:00:34] had a fight every inch of the way."
[1:00:36] Talking about Joshua.
[1:00:38] Joshua and Caleb, they had a fight.
[1:00:41] That's right. But they had the promise
[1:00:43] of victory. You have the promise,
[1:00:45] brother and sister. You have the promise
[1:00:50] of victory. God told Joshua, "Wherever
[1:00:53] the souls of your food tread that I have
[1:00:57] given you."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; No debate about it.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You have the victory. It's given to you.
[1:01:04] It's your possession.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; That victory is given to you. You have
[1:01:10] been told before the game starts by the
[1:01:12] referee. Let's say he told you that ah
[1:01:15] don't worry guys, you I'll make sure
[1:01:18] your group wins. You have the victory.
[1:01:22] You just just have to keep on playing
[1:01:24] Jono.
[1:01:27] You hear that my boy? Keep on walking.
[1:01:33] He says here footprints. So footprints
[1:01:36] meant possession for them. Remember
[1:01:40] that sister in the wheelchair footprints
[1:01:43] means position. Every time the soles of
[1:01:45] your feet touches, that's it. That's
[1:01:47] much. Take that much ground.
[1:01:51] Hallelujah. I want to stop here. Tonight
[1:01:54] is my last service. The Lord willing.
[1:01:57] But I just wanted you to know
[1:02:01] that
[1:02:03] there are footprints on the sense of
[1:02:05] time.
[1:02:06] And then me and you, we leave them.
[1:02:12] We leave them for Lilia. We leave them
[1:02:15] for Giovanni.
[1:02:18] We leave them for Thea. We leave them
[1:02:21] for Daniel and for Fi and for Rebecca.
[1:02:26] Yes, Rebecca. We leave them for Gabby.
[1:02:30] We leave them for Dave and for Dead Dy.
[1:02:33] the footsteps and the sense of time.
[1:02:38] Let's not lose position because the way
[1:02:41] we walk,
[1:02:44] they are going to look at those
[1:02:45] footsteps and not only them if the Lord
[1:02:48] tries the ones after them.
[1:02:52] So, we've got such a powerful thing. The
[1:02:55] same way that Joshua got the he saw the
[1:02:58] footsteps on the sent of time of Moses,
[1:03:01] he knew that I'm going to walk like
[1:03:03] this.
[1:03:05] Whether I die or I leave, I'm going to
[1:03:07] keep walking. Please, let's stand on our
[1:03:10] feet as we invite brother Ben. But then
[1:03:12] I want you not to forget this to walk in
[1:03:15] position. Then you won't lose your
[1:03:18] possession. We will keep our possession.
[1:03:21] As brother Ben comes, let's say, we walk
[1:03:25] in the light.
[1:03:29] Such a beautiful
[1:03:32] light. Walk
[1:03:35] where the J drops. Sorry for the
[1:03:38] musicians, please come of mercy.
[1:03:43] Oh, shine all around us.
[1:03:49] It's actually sounding very good without
[1:03:51] instruments for a little bit. Oh, his
[1:03:54] eyes are the light of
[1:04:00] Oh,
[1:04:01] we walk in the light. Oh, such a
[1:04:07] beautiful
[1:04:09] light. Oh, come way.
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:25] I
[1:04:26] [Music]
[1:04:30] Jesus
[1:04:33] the light of the world.
[1:04:39] Amen.
[1:04:41] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad
[1:04:44] Revelation puts you in position to
[1:04:45] possess
[1:04:47] all things?
[1:04:49] Amen.
[1:04:52] Praise the Lord. Brother Abraham says
[1:04:55] his blood, the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:57] puts us in speaking terms with with God.
[1:05:00] It puts us in that condition.
[1:05:02] Amen. We can come boldly for the throne
[1:05:04] of grace. Thank you, brother Paul.
[1:05:07] Amen. We just keep our position. We can
[1:05:10] possess all things. God bless you.
[1:05:12] Appreciate that. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:14] Let's um you can have your seats um
[1:05:17] tonight.
[1:05:20] Amen. And we're just going to just going
[1:05:22] to read through the prayer requests.
[1:05:23] There's quite a list tonight. We know
[1:05:26] our God is more than able.
[1:05:29] So I'm just going to start reading
[1:05:30] these.
[1:05:32] I think after we read,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; no matter what I hear,
[1:05:41] I believe,
[1:05:44] no matter what I'm told,
[1:05:48] no matter how it seems,
[1:05:51] no matter what it costs,
[1:05:56] I believe.
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:00] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:06:04] broken,
[1:06:07] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:06:10] on the altar.
[1:06:14] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:06:18] over,
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:06:25] on the altar
[1:06:28] because he's a miracle. He's a miracle.

[1:06:57] God. A miracle working. No matter what I
[1:07:01] see,
[1:07:04] no matter what I feel,
[1:07:07] no matter what I hear,
[1:07:11] I believe.
[1:07:14] No matter what I'm told,
[1:07:18] no matter how it seems,
[1:07:21] no matter what it costs.
[1:07:29] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:07:33] broken,
[1:07:36] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:07:39] on the altar.
[1:07:43] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:07:47] over,
[1:07:50] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:07:53] on the altar
[1:07:56] because he's a miracle. He's a miracle.

[1:08:48] promisekeeping
[1:08:50] God.

[1:09:14] miracle. He's a miracle. He's a miracle
[1:09:19] working God. A miracle working.
