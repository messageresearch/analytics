TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh, [music] down. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Welcome to the house of God this morning. It's good to see you all. As I was hopping up here, I couldn't help but notice my favorite youngest daughter laughing. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself when we were growing when when the children were growing up, we would always bring the King Jame read the King James Bible and and Shannon would like the commandments were word for word what was in the King James Bible. So the children if if someone got in trouble, the other children weren't allowed to laugh cuz you were laughing at their calamity. So you got in trouble if you laughed at someone else's calamity. So someone would do something and the other person would laugh and then David would say, "Oh, mom, Hannah's laughing at my calamity." I'm going to announce to you that that rule no longer applies in our household. [laughter] People laugh at my calamity on a daily basis. So I think that I think when they all the children turned 10 that rule must have gone out the window somewhere. It went out the window cuz it does not apply anymore. Trust me. [music] Let's stand this morning. I'm glad we can serve the Lord this morning. I'm glad we can be in his in his presence. And let's just let's just pray. Lord, we thank you, Lord, that you you're here with us this morning, Lord. where two or three gathered in your name there you are in the midst Lord and we thank you Lord that um no matter what we go through through in life Lord you don't sit back and laugh Lord but you care you love us Lord and and you only want the best for us Lord so we just want to pray you'd meet us this morning in a powerful way thank you for your presence already amongst us I know that each one here has a pure heart and they're chosen and predestinated before the foundation of the world and each one is here Lord to to live out to be who they who we really are. Many of us in times past we were living different lives not this life. I'm even reminded of Saul in the Bible. He was living living a very different life for a while there than who he actually was. But Lord at some point you came and you met him Lord and his his life changed and he be and then he started to live out what he really was from from even before he was born. He was destined to [music] be to be a believer, to be a a son of God, to be called according to your purpose. And that that's each one here, Lord. I'm declaring that that's each person here that no matter what stage of the journey we're at, you have a perfect image of us, Lord, that and that we are coming into that, Lord. We're not that this is not just a routine that we do, but there's a there's a powerful supernatural work going on in our midst. and you're changing every person to become more like the person that you saw in your mind before the foundation of the world, Lord. So, I just want to pray for each one here this morning. May you bless each one, bless our fellowship, bless our worship, and we just want to invite you into our presence, Lord, to [music] to sing praises and to worship you this morning. So, we just um commit ourselves to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. Amen.

Now I'm just free and glad. [music] Jesus got a hold of my life and he won't [singing] let me go. Sometimes I [music] remember how I used to be living in sin.

You try to laugh your way through life, [music] but you're not gaining [singing] ground. Why not [music] try today? Just ask [music] him in your heart to say find Jesus love to be the greatest thing that you've ever found. He just got [music and singing] a hold.

Um so brother blessings ask that everyone who's in part of the um helping set up for the wedding venue and everything um for the wedding on um Saturday um we're going to go view the wedding uh the venue at 1:00 p.m. after church. So any everyone here who's part of the setup, you want to come have a look at the place, get the lay of the land, see how everything's going to go, we're going to go there at 1:00 and see. But we're super excited, but we're not as excited as you're as excited. But yeah, praise the Lord, we're excited with you. So, I believe it's going to be a wonderful weekend next weekend. Amen. We're going to have a tremendous time. So, praise the Lord. Amen. Let's um let's uh take our Bibles this morning. We're going to read from Joshua uh chapter 1 that we're going to read from um the book of Second Corinthians. Joshua 1. I know this is probably a well um we all know these scriptures, but just trust the Lord will bless his word to our hearts. Who's happy to be a Christian today? Praise the Lord. You may have had the worst the worst week of your entire life, but you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd rather be a believer and you know than not, you know. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. And that kind of puts everything in perspective, right? You know, if you know, if you're a Christian, you've you've won it all. &gt;&gt; Everything's actually okay. So, I mean, Ephesians 1 and and and from verse two, I mean, sorry, Joshua 1 and verse two, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. For as I was with Moses, so shall I be with thee. I'll not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers uh to give them. Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate there in day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt um then for thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest. Amen. And we're just going to turn to 2 Corinthians. I'm going to read just verses 1-7 here. And um so 2 Corinthians 5 and:es 1-7 says, "For we know that if our earthly tabernac uh our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens." Do you know that this morning? &gt;&gt; Is that personal to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. For in this we grown earnestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we uh that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened. Not that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now he that hath wrought us for the self, same as God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit. Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that whilst we are at home in this body, we're absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning. If you have a need, you just want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me during this time." Amen. God bless you. Gracious Father, as we stand here this morning, we invite you, Lord, as we sang the last song, let my Jesus change your life. And Lord, I just want to let you come and change my life this morning. Lord, you'd mold and shape dear God into your image. And not just me, but everyone here, Lord, those who may be streaming, Father, our desire is to be more like you. So, may you grant it this morning, I pray. May you anoint your word, not just uh not the speaker, but the hearer also. May you have complete liberty in our lives, Lord. just move as you want to move. Touch our lives. Do what you want to do, Lord. We want to praise and worship you this morning. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this grand opportunity. We pray you'd forgive us of our sins and our wrongs. Cleanse us of our secret faults, Father, this day. We thank you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, if I could title this, I want to speak about take courage. &gt;&gt; Take courage this morning. Amen. Don't be don't be dismayed or or or troubled, but but be strong. Be of be of good courage. Now, as we read here in Joshua, this is very familiar, I'm sure, to to uh us all, but the book of the book of Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians, as as brother Ram would say, that the book of Joshua is the Ephesians of the Old Testament. It's the placing of the people in the land. And we are living in a in a Joshua generation, a Joshua season where we're not just wandering around in the wilderness round the same mountain over and over again, not claiming any land, just going to church, going home, coming back. And no, but we have entered into the promised land, which is Christ. As brother Bram would say, the son of man is the promised land. And we have entered uh you know, if you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, amen, you have entered into your inheritance. You've entered into Christ. And now we we are living in a season where um we're going to possess every promise where God has anointed his people that every promise does pertain to the bride of Jesus Christ. We're not living with a hope so one day that we can receive all things. But we have received all things today and we are here to push back every enemy, every every complex, every speck of unbelief. It doesn't matter if it was down through your family lineage. I tell you that's not important today. I think we need to look beyond our flesh. We don't walk by sight. We walk by faith. So, we don't walk by how we feel or we don't walk by our our temperament or our makeup or any of those things though that's part of us. But we have something far greater than your humanity this morning. We have the eternal God. Amen. Who's here to mold us, to shape us, to to to change our lives. And and you know, I believe, you know, I'm so thankful that we have no excuse, amen, to pull back. We have no excuse to to to blame anything or anybody. Amen. Why we would keep out of the promised land or possess more land. We have no excuses. Amen. God has given his full enablement to this generation. Amen. That we will possess every every speck of that land. Amen. Where there won't be one spirit holding us back. There'll be no unforgiveness. I say stop beating yourself up this morning. Amen. With your mistakes and your past. Put it under the blood. Recognize God is taking care of it. Amen. He's taking care of your past. He's taking care of you and your completeness. Amen. So, stop beating yourself up with the could be of life. Just walk on with God. Amen. We're not here to look in the rearview mirror. We're here to look forward. Amen. I believe that as we close this year out, amen. We're here to Amen. possess every divine promise of God. Amen. We're not here to just just we let's forget complexes. AMEN. GOD HAS MADE US IN SUCH A WAY that this humanity we will live in will not hinder the work of God. I mean because you have surrendered your life completely to God. So nothing in this flesh, nothing in your human spirit can hinder him because he's greater than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think we should just walk on with God this morning. We should take courage. Amen. That doesn't matter how great the battle's been. Doesn't matter what you've been going through. Amen. God is greater than that thing. Amen. And he is determined that you're going to pack out the victory. REMEMBER, IT'S NOT YOU THAT WINS the victory. It's who you surrender to gives you the victory. Amen. He conquered hell, death, and the grave. SO WHY NOT just rest in his ability? Rest in his power. REST IN THE FACT HE KNOWS ALL THINGS. Rest in the fact everything's working for your good. Rest in him. Amen. DON'T REST IN WHAT YOU CAN DO. AMEN. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU can do, you'll fail miserably AND BECOME A BITTER PERSON. BUT IF you look at him, YOU REALIZE HIS TIME FRAME'S different to yours. Amen. His timing is the best. Amen. We want everything instant. But let God be God in your life. Amen. Just because you don't see the promise being fulfilled doesn't mean he hasn't heard YOUR PRAYER. AMEN. FAITH DOESN'T LOOK with by the five senses. It doesn't look by what you imagine. It looks by revelation. Amen. And we are people walking in revelation of the open book this morning where God has unveiled himself in his completeness. AMEN. THAT WE'RE NOT JUST HOPING ONE DAY THAT THERE WILL COME A PEOPLE OR THERE'LL COME A MESSAGE to restore all things. We're living in that day. I MEAN, WE'RE LIVING IN THE SEASON OF THE FULL RESTORATION OF THE WORD WHERE GOD HAS PLACED US IN IN HEAVENLY places in Christ Jesus. And if we are PLACED IN HEAVENLY PLACES, THE DEVIL'S UNDER OUR FEET. AMEN. SO, I friends, it's time to trample on the enemy. It's time to let him let God use your voice and address your enemy and bind that mumber in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joshua is told to be very strong. Be strong and very courageous. Amen. It takes a people of courage. I mean, I believe I'm not looking at cowards this morning. I believe I'm not looking at people who just want to hide away and watch life go by, but they want to go over the top of the trench. I mean, they want to take no man's land. They want to press the battle. Amen. You know, if we were there, you know, Brother Bam, the last words he heard from beyond the curtain of time was, "Keep pressing the battle. Keep pressing the battle." And I believe if we could hear that mighty host of witnesses that we're surrounded by, they'd say the same thing to you and I. Keep pressing the battle. Amen. The the baton's been placed in your hand. Amen. YOU MUST POSSESS ALL PROMISES. AMEN. AMEN. WE'RE WAITING on you CUZ WITHOUT YOU, WE CANNOT BE MADE PERFECT or complete. Amen. So friends, TAKE COURAGE THIS MORNING. REMEMBER, WHO IS THE GOD WHO SENT YOU? YOU WEREN'T SENT BY A CHURCH. YOU WEREN'T SENT BY YOUR OWN AMBITION. YOU WEREN'T sent by some man or some system. No, YOU WERE SENT BY ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. LIKE JOSHUA WAS COMMISSIONED BY GOD. I'VE HAVE I NOT COMMANDED THEE? &gt;&gt; HAVE I NOT SENT THEE? &gt;&gt; Be strong &gt;&gt; and very courageous. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we do not walk in this world groaning to leave it because of how bad it is. I'm just basically &gt;&gt; saying what Paul said. &gt;&gt; He said we we are in this tabernacle. We do groan &gt;&gt; being burdened not that we would be unclothed. &gt;&gt; So this world is falling apart but that's not the groan of our hearts why we want to leave. We want to be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have an ambition. I want to see him. &gt;&gt; I want to see his glorious face. &gt;&gt; I want to see him. &gt;&gt; We're going to meet him one day. That's the ambition of my life. Lord, I want to see your plan done. I want to see a plan of redemption complete where every man, woman, and child, boy, and girl, Amen, who's part of your lamb's book of life is dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ that we can go home cuz I want to see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our desire of our life. Amen. I'm I'm talking for you. As I say we, I'm not just saying this royal we thing, but that's that's your feeling, right? That's what Don't you want to see him? Oh, how's he going to treat me? Well, he's given you his unfailing love this side. Amen. So that means he's he's not going to change his mind. He can't change his mind about you that side. Amen. His thoughts towards you here are the same thoughts there. Amen. When he sees you face to face physically, he's not going to say, "Oh, well, I got that wrong." He's not that kind of a God. He sees you perfectly as you are right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. With your struggles, with your humanity, all those things that doesn't even come into his scales of of making a conclusion about you. No, he saw you before the foundation of the world. Amen. Made in his image, spotless, perfect, without blemish or any such thing. Amen. And if he saw you that way, that's how you're going to end up. And that's the condition of your soul this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We say it is well with our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. So courage, Webster would tell us, is a mental or moral strength to venture. It means to persevere and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty. Amen. So I believe that we we have the mental or moral strength I say the spiritual strength to venture out &gt;&gt; to take God at his word. Now we're not pursuing any promise of God. We are not living in an age where the bride of Jesus Christ is presuming or probing. No, all of God's word has been revealed. We're venturing. If there's a promise in the word for you, it's actually you're not presuming. You can venture with authority. It's mine because all that Jesus died on Calvary for is given to me. Amen. So we're not guessing or maybe it's mine or just yes. No, we're presume we are not presuming as brother preaches sermon presuming, right? No, we are we are venturing with authority. Amen. All of heaven is behind you. Amen. God himself is behind you. If God be for us, who can be against us? You got to put yourself IN THAT SCRIPTURE. IF GOD BEFORE ME, WHAT CAN BE AGAINST ME? AMEN. There's nothing can withstand you if God is for you. Amen. In the strong concordance says uh it says the primitive uh root of it is to be alert physically on foot or mentally encouraged. I mean to be courageous of good courage steadfastly minded. I trust we have made up our mind. We're not in this balance of is God's word right or is it not? Is God God or is he not? You know, no. I believe that I'm looking at people who have made up their mind. They're steadfastly minded. God is always right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is right above my feelings. He's right above my culture. He's right above my upbringing. He's right above wherever I'm living. He's right above my imaginations. His word is always right compared to what? &gt;&gt; Compared to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll take his word above all things. I trust we are steadfastly minded in that. Amen. That we are not here to try and twist the scripture or twist the message to meet our own ends. But we're here to say, God, change me to match your word. That's all I'm interested in. Amen. this morning. &gt;&gt; It means to be to to establish. It means to fortify. I mean, we're being fortified. But I'm just going to go through this list a bit cuz you got to realize this is what God's made you to be. You're fortified. Amen. Behind the word of God. You're not on some battlefield unarmed. Just some sitting duck or you know that kind of thing. No. No. You're armed and dangerous this morning. I mean, the word of God, that sharp two-edged sword, Amen, is in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It means to harden. Now the believer does not harden their hearts against their fellow believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or against this fall people in this fallen world. &gt;&gt; No, that's no. Taking courage is willing to be vulnerable. Taking courage is being willing to care to venture out and actually stretch out a hand of fellowship to show you care to show you love. Amen. A coward will build a wall, build a bunker in their heart and hide away. We're not here to build bunkers. I'm not interested in concrete working. You know, I was in Yeah, I know I've said this before, but you know, my parents, they used to live in Papa Newu Guinea where the Japanese had their headquarters of that part of the Pacific. And I was Admiral Yamamoto was the leader of the Japanese forces there. I've been in his bunker. This is the Admiral leading that part of the Pacific theater. It's a short, dingy, it's a dark. There's nothing nice about it. And he would have had the best bunker there was. He's the admiral. Admiral. Why build a bunker when you can walk out and you can you can enjoy God's pasture, the sun shining, the goodness of God, the spirit of God blowing. Why h why hold yourself away in some damp dingy thing where you just well I'm just going to, you know, I'm just going to preserve myself and I don't want to, you know, I don't want to share anything and I'm just going to protect my heart. I've been hurt before and yeah, but God's the healer. &gt;&gt; God's the healer. I mean, there's nothing in life that, you know, of us, right? There's nothing in life that God can't fix. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's never a He's not the kind of doctor that you get to a point where he says, "I'm sorry. I can't help you anymore." &gt;&gt; That is human doctors. Amen. He is the great physician. Amen. So, there's nothing. But you've got to be willing to put yourself on his operating table and let him do a work. Amen. In spite of who's done it to you, how bad. I'm not negating any of those things, but you got to be willing. Lord, fix me. &gt;&gt; Fix me, Lord. It takes someone with courage to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes a coward who will hide their symptoms and hide away. But it takes courage to step out and actually take God at his word. It take it took non the greatest courage. He was the he was a general in the Syrian or what you know enemies of Israel his you know their army. You know he was a coward hiding behind those bandages when he had the leprosy. &gt;&gt; But you see his servant girl had so much a god about her. She just said, "Man, I wish I wish non was in Israel. There's a prophet in Israel that could heal him and there'd be no recorded case of anyone being healed of leprosy before." But she just had a faith. She had a courage. My God can fix your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you tell someone that out of love. Amen. That's taking courage. Not just sympathizing with someone. Actually, you know, God can help you. &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus can change your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, so what did he do? He was willing to stop hiding. And it took him more courage to go to the king and show his vulnerability, show his secret places. Amen. Show that sin that was hidden behind armor out in the public. But at home, it really came out. We are our best and worst at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can put on a mask and you can you can you can put on a message mask and put on a message kind of persona and you can that's basically putting bandages on, putting arm on. You can come to church and you can you can pretend all is well, but there's one person you can never fall and that's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God sees straight through your bandages and he sees your need, but the thing is you're going to be willing, Lord, I need a place to dip that I can be cleansed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So non non you know, he could hide from his soldiers, but he couldn't hide from his family. And then so and then and then his servant girl told him about, you know, Israel. There's a prophet there. And you know, then he went to the king and you know the rest of the story. But he's willing to, it took him real courage to say, "I have this thing in my life that if I let it keep going, I will become an exile. &gt;&gt; I'll become in a leper colony. The person everyone thought I was, I'm not because of this disease. &gt;&gt; Sin will get you. &gt;&gt; It's not worth holding on to." &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go to the River Jordan to be cleansed. There's a fountain filled with blood flowing from Emanuel's veins. You can plunge and you say, "Well, I'm saved. I'm not even talking about that necessarily." But if you've got something's got a hold of your life, something that you brought out of Egypt, not even knowing about it. Amen. Then God can take that from you. I mean, there's a reason why Joshua, we don't have it here, but he would tell the children of Israel, we got to circum God would say, "Circumcise again." So, we've been going through Joshua and family prayer. So, that's where all these things have come from. So, sorry children. And this is you're getting it again. Okay. But you see, they they were told circumcise again because the reproach of Egypt had to be taken off of their lives. Even though some of them weren't even born in Egypt, but yet that reproach had to be gone. And so it's the same thing with us. We can carry things out of the world. We don't realize we have. We've been called out. We've been justified. But God needs to we we need another circumcision sometimes. Amen. Because you're going into a greater walk. Going to a greater inheritance. Amen. We're not living in the wilderness having church splits and fussing and fighting and you know all those kind of things. No, we're going into Canaan's fair land. I believe we're already there. But you got to realize friends, we're not here to go around a mountain. &gt;&gt; Don't go around a mountain from your past of something that you just keep in your mind that just keeps ruling you and this thing and you just keep and it and it becomes a focal point of your life. Doesn't matter if you walk around this side of the mountain, you get married, you walk around this side, you've had children, but this thing holds you. It's like it's you're stuck in its orbit, &gt;&gt; right? Let God break that. &gt;&gt; Let God break that. Amen. That you can turn northward and walk into every divine promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we as as Joshua was told, don't fear. &gt;&gt; Fear not. And what was the first words the angel told brother Brandham? Fear not, for I've been sent from the presence of almighty God. Amen. So there's one thing that there is a constant battle or can be is we are called not to fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. But thing is if you allow fear to grip you, Amen, it will rule you. But your thing is you got to realize everything of the enemy that tries to bind you down. You don't have to bow down to that thing. But you've been given authority by the blood of Jesus Christ, by the word of God, amen, to bind that thing and put it under your feet. Amen. Cuz God wants to give you a testimony. Amen. He doesn't He doesn't just want to have Brother Bram's testimony. He must have a living testimony in 2025. That's what he's interested in this day. Amen. Sure, it's good to quote the prophet stories, but what about your story? What has God done in your life? Amen. Cuz the same God that was with Moses was with Joshua, right? The same God that was with the prophet is now with the bride. Amen. So, we are here that everything will be under our feet. Now, he was told, "Fear not." You know, the enemy only has enough power. We're talking about this too at home. The enemy only has enough power that you give him. Brother um would be asked in questions and answers. Quite a lengthy answer, but I just give a section of it here. He says, "Now that man was um uh was some of these spirits that was cast out of the swine in Gdara, some of those poor people out there in the insane institution being their heads against patter cells. Remember, devils never die. Devils always live. But there will be a time when devils will have to die. Amen. they will become totally annihilated. But now they're alive and they work from generation to generation from um upon human beings. Some of them is in the form of a cancer. Some's in the form of epilepsy. Some's in the form of tuberculosis. They get into the flesh. But seemingly they are powerless until they get into a person. They have to operate through a person. Well, how does that normally begin? No, I'm not talking about just I'm talking about spiritual problems here. Now we know through cancer things there's a bruised cell the devil gets in through that bruised cell right and and and then it's the same in the spiritual side there be a bruise or a wound you can be you know you know Joshua was told don't be dismayed right we can be dismayed at at how other people treat us or how even our own uh behavior we can become very discouraged in ourselves but Joshua was told don't be dismayed right don't fear be of strong be of good courage And then so but what happens is the enemy uh you know these things happen in our life and that's like a doorway the enemy can step in and many times things like fear can come in because there's always the fear of the unknown what's going to happen tomorrow. Many people they overthink life and they cross bridges before they get to them. They already got a in their mind this is the trajectory of their life and this is where it's going to go. I tell you what, nine times or 99% of the time, it's the enemy leading that imagination because it always ends up in ruin. It always ends up in calamity. But friends, if you just let God lead your thoughts, amen, those thoughts don't go negative into destruction, but they go into peace. They go into joy. They go into love. They go into faith. Amen. They come into a positive attitude. Amen. Let God lead your thinking that way. Don't let DON'T LET YOUR THINKING go negative. You're going to realize that's the enemy trying to derail you, make you dismayed, and he's trying to put a spirit of fear upon you to to to uh disable your Christian walk. Amen. But I tell you what, friends, fear is not our king. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord JESUS CHRIST IS MY KING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And and and he is the great one. Amen. He there's no fear in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that kind of fear that cripples. Amen. There's a reverential fear and trust. That's godly fear. But you know with us, you know, we're not here to live in fear. &gt;&gt; But fear is powerless until it can get someone to work through, &gt;&gt; right? But you know, you know, it's just like a bad attitude. You know what is that? That's a spirit that can bother someone. They can they can, you know, be so positive something happens just a bad attitude. Then what happens? They just start spouting negative things about people about their life and this is going on and they'll somehow swing the whole conversation negative. Who's who's experienced that? Right? &gt;&gt; What is that? Now, it's it's because that spirit is powerless until it can find someone to work through. &gt;&gt; But friends, I believe we're here that the devil, you know, the devil should be absolutely powerless in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. That everything he tries to drag us down by, he just ends up defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know we will be tried by every spirit, but every spirit will fall at our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God has ordained it thus in this age. that we will not go down in defeat, but we will climb in victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you never ever never ever let a negative thought roost in your mind. &gt;&gt; Always have a positive attitude. You know, you say, "Well, I got nothing positive to think on." Well, actually, you got a lot to think on &gt;&gt; that's positive. Amen. You just take the message of the hour or you take the Bible. There's a lot of positive things, &gt;&gt; isn't that right? Well, you know, my life and what's going on. Look at the eternal. Why don't you zoom out to the big picture? &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, I was made in his image, rejoicing, dancing in God's thinking. God brought me through this process. He says it's like a photograph. Back in the day before there was I think you can still buy some old school film, &gt;&gt; right? Before it was digital, right? What happens is you take that you take that film and you take it into a dark room. You pro and then you and then you take it through a chemical process. So what was captured on the film now becomes material. You can see it, right? And it's the same thing. This world is a dark room, &gt;&gt; but through a through a process &gt;&gt; of justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, trials, hardship, different things, God is bringing forth an image that was there from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can rejoice saying, "Well, I'm just going through a process. &gt;&gt; How's life?" Yeah, I'm just being processed &gt;&gt; by God to do to the image he had of me is now being formed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's determined it's going to be formed. &gt;&gt; Amen. A Amen. So they are seemingly powerless till they can get a person. Amen. That they can operate through. Which brings to another thought that the Holy Ghost covers the earth, but it's almost helpless until it can get into you and me. &gt;&gt; Because God is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; He does not force anything upon anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be willing to let him live. That's why you take the, you know, Hebrews 11, the heroes of faith. And we can bring that down to 20:25. Everyone in the heroes of faith, every believer now that's got a testimony, one thing happened. They allowed God to live. &gt;&gt; They allowed God to reveal himself. They allowed God to live in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is depending on you and I, the Holy Spirit. The earth is full of the spirit of God but uh but it's poured out but it cannot operate till it comes into us we human beings to operate and the devil wants to take us over to operate under him. So when we uh when he gets the mild form he starts in sin if he can hold just a just in a righteous man a good man and let him go ahead and try to be good like that. If he can hold him like that until he's dead that's all he wants to do. He's got him. Because no matter how righteous you are, how good you are, how moral you are, how clean you are, how honest you are, you'll never get to heaven until you are born again. Jesus said, "So you've got to be born. You've got to be regenerated or there's not a way in the world you can enter heaven or ever come to Christ." Amen. So don't just be a good person. Don't just be a good message person. Come to Christ. Let him give you a birth, a real experience, a change. Amen. where you realize something's happened to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Joshua would be told before they ever crossed the Jordan that God is going to give them a sign that they're going to take the whole land. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love this. And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, "Come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God." And Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail," say without fail. &gt;&gt; Without fail, &gt;&gt; drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Pesites and the Gersites, the Amorites and the Jebusites. Amen. So whatever itites that have been there camping on your promises, he's going to drive it out. Indifference, he's going to drive it out. You can't forgive, he's going to drive it out. Impatience, he's going to drive it out. I mean, some luster, he's going to drive it out. I mean, whatever the thing is that that that that you've got to that that's in your life that's going to be it's going to be all driven out without fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. Now therefore, take you 12 men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe of man. It shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come up from above, and they shall stand upon and heap. Amen. So by this, God saying, "By this, you'll know you're going to take the whole land." So before they ever set foot in the promised land, God says, "By this sign, you're going to without fail conquer all." And then the scripture goes that that you know as soon as the uh priests put their soul their foot in the in the Jordan that it parted. Amen. And however hund I mean however hundreds of thousands or million or however many people with their oxen and their sheep and all their possessions they cross over on dry land. Amen. They not even fought a battle in the promised land yet. Not even got to Jericho. Hadn't got anywhere near those things. But God says when you see this happen Amen. I'm gonna This is a sign. You're going to without fail. Amen. Cross I mean possess the whole land. And we've had a prophet stand in this day. Amen. He's carried the ark of the word and every true minister carries it as well. Not on the head but in the heart. Amen. You know the ark of all the covenant of God. Amen. Carried down to that river Jordan. What does Jordan represent? Death to self. Amen. And he and what happens is that word actually gives you an entrance to cross over into Canaan's fear land. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not trying to wait over in our own ability, our own thoughts. No, God has given a way. Amen. For us to die to ourselves. Amen. He gives us grace. Amen. To make a full surrender, then that grace imparts his nature, his own presence into our lives. Amen. And if so, if you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God is telling you by this you shall know, you will possess all things. Amen. Without fail, you'll conquer all. Amen. THERE'S NOT ONE THING THAT CANNOT BE CONQUERED. AMEN. By the spirit of God within you. Everything must be under YOUR FEET. EVERY PART OF THE PROMISED LAND, THERE'S NOT ONE INCH THAT THE DEVIL MUST HOLD. WITHOUT FAIL, YOU'LL TAKE IT ALL. AMEN. WELL, YOU SAY, "I'VE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE TRY AND FAIL, BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU. AND I'VE SEEN OTHER CHURCHES RISE AND FAIL, BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU. I'VE SEEN OTHER FAMILIES FALL APART, BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU." AMEN. I'VE SEEN OTHER CHILDREN NEVER COME BACK, BUT THEY'RE NOT YOURS. AMEN. DON'T LIVE BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE. LIVE BY THE PROMISE OF GOD TO YOU. AMEN. THAT WITHOUT FAIL YOU YOU WILL RECEIVE ALL. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't just have positive thinking. We got a revelation of God. I mean, the reality of his word. I say without fail, you say, "Well, I don't know." Yo, well, what about that person? Forget those people. It's you and God. &gt;&gt; It's me and Jesus. We're going all the way straight and narrow way. There's only room for two on the road. Me and him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And actually, it's such a narrow way. He goes before me. He's my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think I think we can take courage this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you brought me thus far &gt;&gt; and you've now you've shown me, Lord, I'm going to get it all back. I'm going to recover all like David in that great time of transition between Saul, you know, Saul's death and David becoming king over Israel. Amen. He lost everything. Amen. His men lost everything in Ziglag. They lost their families, their loved ones, their everything precious. The things they held most dear, they lost it all that time of transition. But what did he do? He took courage. He encouraged himself in the Lord. Amen. He didn't walk by sight. He walked by faith. Amen. He went to his source of strength. Amen. Which is the Lord himself. And then God said, "You will recover all without fail." &gt;&gt; He says, "Shall I pursue? What should I do in the circumstances?" His men wanted to stone him. He was in a dire strait of a situation, but he turned to a source of strength. And I tell you what, friends, if you feel discouraged this morning, turn to your source of courage. Amen. Which is the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. Turn to your source of strength. Begin feeding on the GOOD THINGS OF GOD. AMEN. DON'T FEED ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. STOP DOOM SCROLLING AND start joy turning a wonder. Turn the Bible. Amen. You get some joy in your soul. You'll get happy about it. Amen. So swap one for the other and you'll you'll find courage come into your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's Ron Spencer tells a story. Some others I've heard it. You know, there was a there was a cat chasing a mouse and that mouse was running and the cat was, you know, after it running on tables, chairs up and down, running for its life. This mouse was I mean, then finally, you know, the cat kind of just left the pursuit or something and this because this mouse actually jumped and it landed into a bottle of wine, you know, and then the bottle turned over. But this but this but this mouse was drinking all this wine and the cat thought well the mouse is dead so it just wandered off. But then the mouse slowly, you know, slipped out of the bottle of wine. It was half empty and the mouse was staggering like this. Says, now where's that cat and started drinking some courage? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IT MADE IT FEEL THAT IT WAS BIGGER than the cat. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT MADE HIM FEEL THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN THAT CAT. THAT THAT CAT HAD SOMETHING TO FEAR NOW. AMEN. IT BE WHY? CUZ THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT IN THE MOUSE BECAME EXPONENTIAL. HALLELUJAH. I tell you what, friends. Start drinking on the goodness of God. Amen. YOUR WALK WILL START MAY MAYBE YOU'LL BE GOING JOY AND peace and you'll be all happy. Say, now where is that devil? &gt;&gt; I mean, WHERE'S THIS PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN AFFLICTING ME? I'm going to deal with this thing once and for all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a um Yeah, it's it's not how big we are. &gt;&gt; It's how big he is. That's how big our God is that counts. Amen. It's not people who take courage, they say, you know, people who take courage look beyond themselves. They look beyond their own ability. How? Amen. And you know, the believer, who do we look to? We look to our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We look to our great shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he's greater than them all. As I said a while ago, I just want to read it though. He says, "And Jesus said to them again, peace be unto you. As my father has sent me, even so send I you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That same commission's been placed in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrected Lord Jesus says, "As my father sent me, I'm sending you to this world. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have a living witness here in this place, and it's you." Amen. So, and you know, it's the same thing with Moses. The God that sent Moses went in Moses to perform &gt;&gt; his word. It's the same thing with you and I. The God that sent you is in you that he will perform his word in your life. Amen. Because just like brother brother would say that as Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies of the old testament so the bride will fulfill the testimonies of the new. Well how's that going to happen? Our ability absolutely not. Human ability can never bring the word of god to pass. But if you just surrender to him amen that he will bring his word to pass in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the lord. You know, many times, like brother B would say in the Hebrew series, he'd say, "Many times we tell people what they should stop doing or what they ought not to do." Amen. But Paul wasn't that way. When the Philippian jailer, you know, after Paul and Silas had a had a praise praise break there in the prison, they begin to praise God cuz they realized God was above their pain, their hurt, their their no doubt disappointment of ending up in jail when they're there on a mission trip. And God shook the whole place, unshackled everybody, opened every prison door, and then the Philippian jailer there, the jailer was going to kill himself because that was his thing. If he let anyone um you know, escape, it was his life. &gt;&gt; But then, but then as he's about to do that, he heard a voice from the inner prison, which was Paul and Silas. They said, "Don't harm yourself. We're all still here." &gt;&gt; And then so the Philippian jailer said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?" And many times when people ask that, we say, "Well, you need to stop this and you need to stop doing this and stop drinking and stop smoking and stop this and stop gaming and stop gambling and all these things. Dress right, all these things." But Paul didn't say what you had to stop doing. He said what you need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what you need to do will take care of the things that you need to stop doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he say? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved. In other words, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for thy house. Amen. Because faith in God will take care of everything. I mean, it'll take care of everything that's hung on us from out of the world. If it's a religious spirit, legalism, faith in the Lord will take care of that. I mean, things that people struggle with because of the flesh. &gt;&gt; IT'LL TAKE CARE of those things. I mean, we're to be encouraged this morning. Believe faith works. &gt;&gt; Faith is a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is prevailing. Amen. revelation which is faith there. It is a prevailing power. This morning, Brother Arab said there's nothing as prevailing with power as revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, well, I'm battling this thing." Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. He'll take care of it. Amen. Faith brings everything into perspective. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is what controls everything. And what does faith do? Put you in God's hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the same thing with prayer. Prayer isn't necessarily us changing God's mind. It's God changing our mind. And he does it through prayer. Amen. And it puts the whole situation in God's control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says Paul never told him that. He just told him the things he ought to do. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. Now he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life. That's a thunder flashing. John 5:24. I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases. James 5:14, "Call the elders, anoint them uh in oil, prayer of faith will save the sick. The urine fleshing sea." That's God's eternal word. Now, the grace of God is so great in this day. I Yeah, I know I keep referring back to it, but to me, it was such a milestone camp we had. We live in a season of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this and this season's never going to come to an end. And I think brother Isaac mentioned it um la couple of Wednesdays ago when he's you know when he mentioned about Enoch. Now this is how great now this is the grace that was upon your type your shadow right remember you're the reality Enoch the seventh from Adam was pointing to you the bride of Jesus Christ in this last day. You think about here Enoch walked with God we know and he was not cuz God took him. I was trying to find a picture and that was kind of it. But you know Enoch had his ups and downs. He had his family struggles. He had his own personal struggles. He was human. He wasn't devoid of of of any temptation. He was a real person living a real life. It wasn't some idyllic picnic picnic every day. Right? But the thing is God's grace was so great. Now in that day, there was nothing in existence that could actually change his body. Right? &gt;&gt; There wasn't even the blood of bulls and goats by Moses' law. And even even uh Paul would say that death never leth reigned from Adam to Moses. So death was reigning until Moses in the law. Okay. So so so death had complete control. Now in this time of death having complete control, there was a man walking with God. This is how GREAT THE GRACE OF GOD IS. You think about there was nothing there that could change change Enoch, right? But you see the grace of God was so great in his life. There was no BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. There was no perfect atonement. There was nothing there. But yet God's grace was so great in his life. He said, "Look, Enoch, in this time when death is reigning, I'm going to take you off the earth." Amen. And he began to walk with God. Remember, he lived 365 years. The first 65, he wasn't walking with God. But then God interrupted his own plans. &gt;&gt; Interrupted Enoch's plans. And God started walking with Enoch, right? And God start Yeah. Enoch started walking with God. And then what happened is one day you know God you know Enoch start you know walked so far with God he just walked all the way home with God. Amen. So so in a time when death was reigning. Amen. God took Enoch off the earth. Amen. Now if God could do that with a person where where death was reigning. Amen. How much more a people now now we know death is riding. The fourth seal is in manifestation. We know Satan becomes incarnate in a man when the bride goes up. Right? But that last horse ride is death. We're living in a time of spiritual death. It's on the whole world. Amen. We're living in a time of death like there's never been. But yet in this season when death is here, amen, there's a people that the life of God has taken control of. Amen. And the blood of Jesus Christ has become so real. Amen. It's true power is coming to full manifestation. Amen. Why? Hallelujah. Why? Because God wants to show this is how great my grace is. &gt;&gt; That's why be of be of good courage this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. If a man can go to heaven and then your death is raining, how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ living in a season when death is riding? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we must realize that every divine promise of God is ours by God's quickening power. Every promise. Amen. So, just like as Joshua was told by this sign, by the priest going in the Jordan parting, you're going to take every promise. And by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that God's quickening power. Amen. It gives you every promise on God in God's word. I'm just going to read this. I like it. Now watch them. It was also designed to give them after this abstract. It was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds. Every promise on the grounds of God's word that was promised in the Bible, that quickening power was give to them. I mean, to quicken that promise. And therefore, they laid hands on the sick and they was healed. They spoke in new tongues. They done great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise. And when Jesus died to redeem them uh redeem that back to them, the grounds that belong to sons of God, he demonstrated what God was. He says, "How dare we socialize that and put it into an organization we have no rights to do that." It's the Holy Spirit today is hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at a room of honest hearts. Everything in the Bible that was promised, amen, is to that believer. And when you accept it in its fullness and God knows you'll do it, he gives you the abstract to it. And then every promise that's made is in your possession. And the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every promise, &gt;&gt; healing, &gt;&gt; deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sanctified life, overcoming power. Amen. EVERY EVERY PROMISE THE BODY change is yours. AMEN. PRODIGS COMING HOME IS YOURS. AMEN. Sickness being healed, deliverance, demon spirits going, complex is going. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you would walk in joy. Amen. The fruit of the spirit would be in bloom in your life. Amen. The full restoration of the church be manifested in you. Amen. Every divine promise that God has given, he's quickened it to you. &gt;&gt; We should be of good courage this morning. It's all ours. &gt;&gt; Did you earn it? No. He just gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Well, what did you do? I didn't do anything. I was doing the opposite. Actually, &gt;&gt; I was his enemy. &gt;&gt; We were his enemies, right? &gt;&gt; Then one day, he came and he died for you and I. &gt;&gt; His holy spirit is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. To give it all. Oh my. What kind of people should we be? How wonderful to see God's great Holy Spirit here to do that power. Think of it. When the Holy Spirit itself here to bear record of this hour, Jesus said so. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can be of good courage that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Nothing can separate us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just, you know, I just want to go through a few more things if you'll give me a bit more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, Paul would come to a place that knowing all things, we're more than conquerors through him that loved us. He says, "For I am persuaded." What persuaded him? God proving his word in his life. Revelation persuaded him that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. So there's nothing in existence can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ. Amen. So why would we fear anything? We don't need to fear nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even it says in Isaiah that no weapon that's formed against you shall prosper. Doesn't matter how fancy that weapon is. Doesn't matter how good it is. It doesn't matter how long it's been forged in the depths of hell to take you out. Amen. I tell you what, if the devil could have taken you out, he would have done it a long time ago. Amen. He would have stopped you even coming to the earth if he could have. But he couldn't. I mean, he could have taken you as a child if he could have. But he couldn't. Why? Because God had a purpose for you. Amen. And nothing can take our lives until God's purpose is fulfilled. Amen. So therefore, no weapon formed against us shall prosper. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's a pretty big gun. It ain't going to work. It ain't going to prosper." Amen. No. Cuz God God is determined. &gt;&gt; He's more determined than you and I. &gt;&gt; He will have a people that's victorious every day. Amen. that live an overcoming life Sunday to Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and all over again, they'll live a victorious overcoming life. And it doesn't matter what the devil can throw against them, they'll still love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says that a man can be so surrendered to God that the devil doesn't even know what to do with him. &gt;&gt; He'll bring out every trick in trick in his bag &gt;&gt; and he'll just then he'll just come to a point there's nothing I can bring out of this thing that can derail this guy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Temptation fails, pride fails, religious spirit fails, false doctrine fails. Amen. Pride, you know, selfishness fails, lust fails, &gt;&gt; unforgiveness fails, sickness fails, hardship fails, hunger fails, all those everything he tries to bring, they just fail. Why? Because that person is so surrendered to God. And the devil comes to play says, "I just don't know what to do with this guy. I've tried. I've sent my best. I've done my worst. And he just gets back up. Says, "Thank you, Jesus, for another day." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, we must not be afraid of anything. &gt;&gt; Nothing in this land we should be afraid of. The giants in that land, they're bred for us. I mean, every problem. See, people Yeah. I know we're talking about this home at two, but you know this at home as well, but you know, people are afraid that a that a that a strong delusion can take out the bride of Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Because the devil wants to put something out there and and fear gives it power. I ain't afraid of a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; I ain't afraid of false doctrine. I ain't afraid of some some some lukewarm spirit trying to take me out. I'm not afraid of it &gt;&gt; because our Lord Jesus said, he said, "For there shall arise false Christ, false prophets, and there shall and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible," in other words, it's not possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Amen. So, he said, "If it was possible, they would deceive the very elect." But it's not possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because my sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY SHEEP KNOW my voice. say, "I know them by name." I mean, they will not follow a stranger. They run from that thing. There's something within them that goes off. Say, "This is not me." &gt;&gt; If you've got the Holy Ghost, you've got a you've got a warning system within you and it even if it can sound so good and so right and so reasonable, there's something in you saying that's not the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not the voice of my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore because of that confidence that we should have as brother Isaac preached WE SHOULD HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE we can never be deceived. &gt;&gt; What do we have to fear? &gt;&gt; We don't need to fear anything. Oh yeah but this and this. And I think that we have come to an end of a season of preaching. Be careful. You'll be taken. &gt;&gt; I've already been taken. Not by a strong delusion. I've been taken by almighty God. Amen. He I am in his hands. Amen. He I am his. I'VE ALREADY BEEN GOT. SO WHY SHOULD I BE CAREFUL BEING GONE BY SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S WEAKER, THAT'S INFERIOR, that's going to burn, THAT'S NOTHING BUT A CHEAP COPY WHEN the real, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, THE GOD OF THE WORD, HAS GOT A HOLD OF my life and I've become a love prisoner to him. I don't need to fear nothing. We can walk in confidence. We can have good courage. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to be afraid of anything. Oh, but it'll get you at the end. I'm not walking like my life is a slow train wreck. We're not in some slow motion explosion like a there's a bomb and it's counting down and we can't put it out. We don't live like that. &gt;&gt; No, we're going to walk victorious out of this world. &gt;&gt; We're overcomers this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's so but the devil, you know, it's strong delusion. Our God stronger. &gt;&gt; Are God stronger? &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. Greater. Not equal, NOT CLOSE TO, NOT MATCHING. NO, GREATER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that greater means greater, larger, elder, and stronger. Amen. God is well, yeah, God is elder than the devil. He was here before the devil. And he'll be here after the devil. Like I was here before the devil. I'll be here after the devil. Amen. I'll be here when the devil's not even a memory. I mean, we won't talk about him. WE WON'T THINK ABOUT HIM. WE WON'T BE PLAGUED by him. He'll be burning. He'll be nothing. You won't be able to find a single speck of that guy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, we will be in eternal bodies. Amen. Rejoicing around the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So our God is greater, larger, elder, and stronger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My sheep hear my voice. I know them and they follow me. &gt;&gt; God does not say they might know my voice and they might follow me. He never said that. No, they know my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to sit there and say, "Is that God or is that not God? My sheep know my voice. If if something's talking to you and you have to work out it's God or not, odds are it's not. Right? He's he's not the author of confusion. We're not led by random happen stance signs and things. God is concrete and he proves himself. And you can know it's God because you can look back and say, "He's led me into his word further." That's how we know it's him. So we don't have to guess nothing. He tells us clearly. &gt;&gt; Well, what if my ear's not open? Are you his? &gt;&gt; And what if I miss it? He'll he'll repeat it again. &gt;&gt; He He'll repeat it until you get it cuz he wants you to get it. Remember, he's determined. He doesn't get frustrated. He doesn't say, "Oh, that guy's just deaf." No. We've been given ears to hear and hearts to receive. We're made that way. We don't become that way. We're made that way. That's why when the message came your way, when God's voice to this age came your way, something in you says, "Well, I hear that." And then you begin to change your while you let God change your life according to that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; You can't. Who's ever tried as a kid? You try and get something out of like your dad's hand. Someone who's strong and you try all your might. You're hanging off his arm and you know, but there's nothing moving there. &gt;&gt; Who's tried that? &gt;&gt; That's like the devil. He tries to get you out of God's hand and God just, he doesn't even have to, you know, flex hard. He just kind of holds you. He's not worried about the devil and his schemes. We get all worried and, you know, the devil's doing this and all these things. No, but God has you in his hands. &gt;&gt; Everything's okay. We can just rest. Amen. My neither shall any man pluck them. And that doesn't mean we're blas. I'm not being blas, right? We have confidence. We have good courage. Our God is in control. like when he came down to Joshua after they crossed Jordan. He came down as a captain of the host of the Lord and and and Joshua draws his sorties and he says, "Are you for me, for us, or for our adversaries?" And and and and God just says, "I'm neither. I'm here to take over. &gt;&gt; I come as the captain of the host of the Lord." Amen. So, he basically said, Joshua, I'm here to take this whole campaign. I told you that YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE him in the land, but I'm going to lead you as you place him in the land. Amen. It wasn't just for Jericho. It was for the whole campaign. Amen. SO THE MIGHTY ANGEL STEPS DOWN INTO YOUR LIFE WHICH IS CHRIST AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO the fullness of adoption to the change of the body and you're going to get every single promise from there to here. You know I was I was you know with Christine in the supermarket and you know it's like okay we're just going in for milk next minute. But I was thinking about this. I thought I thought this is how we should be as Christians. You know you're like you see a promise in the word and okay. So, I need I need some peace. I need some joy. You know, there's something like or healing or something. Right now, men, we just go like this and we're just after that. Why not pick up a whole bunch of blessings on the way? &gt;&gt; Why not have a trolley full? You with me? Amen. You see, men be, oh, yeah, there's some healing here. There's, you know, there's some answered prayer. There's, you know, all these promises. There's a joy. There's some revelation. We just like this. No, I need this one. &gt;&gt; Why not just pick it all up? Why not just look around as you're going towards that promise that's been revealed that it's yours? Why not look around as you're walking down that aisle and pick it all up? &gt;&gt; As brother Collins just said, it's all been paid for anyway. &gt;&gt; You don't need to walk through a checkout. You can be one of those shoplifting people who just walk the whole trolley out and you don't need to feel bad about it. You don't have to make any excuses. &gt;&gt; You don't do that in the natural. That's wrong. Okay. But in the spiritual, why not? Shouldn't we be Shouldn't we go shopping like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get it all. Praise the Lord. Now, on this, I was actually in the supermarket thinking about this. There's another time. God showed Brother Brandon when he was 2/3 to the Jordan. There's a ma, there's a snake represented death on the path, right? And it was after one of his friends and he was crying out saying, "God, have mercy on my brother." because he's trying to strike him and he and he knew that if that snake struck him, he'd be dead, right? And then and then that snake turned and tried to get brother Brandham and it said that that snake as he got closer to him, he just kind of slowed down and stopped. He couldn't he couldn't strike the prophet. And why is that? Because God was in him. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how intimidating the devil is, he can't get you. &gt;&gt; Right? If you're sealed into the day of your redemption, he can't get you. &gt;&gt; He can't break that seal. I'm not going to throw a bottle around. David's not here, so I'm not going to do that this this Sunday. But you see, he can't get you. &gt;&gt; He can hiss up. He can rear up and all those kind of things. He can try and intimidate you. You got to realize this thing has to obey my voice. &gt;&gt; You got a troubled mind. It's got to obey your voice. You're you're anxious this morning. You're full of stress and pressure. That thing's got to obey you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to let that thing anxiety and stress and oh, it's the you know, it's the Christmas season. got to run around and stress and all these things. You don't have to be stressed doing it. You don't have to be anxious for nothing. Amen. You can rest in all things. But you see, we we don't need to be intimidated by those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then a voice came. That serpent came against him. He said, "And a voice came from from from above me." He said, "You have been given power to bind him, the worst or any." Amen. And then of course he you know, brother asked the question, "What must I do?" He says, "There's one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. You must be more sincere. And he prayed. Said, "Lord, make me more sincere. Forgive me, Lord. Make me more sincere." He said he felt the power come into his life. And that thing tried to get him. He says, "I bind you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." The life went out of it. Turned like an turned into like an ant sign like glass. He said he mashed on a little bit to see and then he he said, "Now to see if I can, I loose you and the life came back and then you know then I bind you." We all know the story, right? &gt;&gt; That power is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the power to bind or loose. There's life and death is in the power of the tongue. Amen. And if that's just even just a natural person, a natural person's words can hurt or can heal. How much more someone who's anointed with God. Amen. That God can speak through their lips. Amen. That power is within you. And God, remember, God wants to prove that &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; That you have power to bind the worst or any. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do we have to be afraid of? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, do I have to kind of do something and work it out?" No, no. You step into it, &gt;&gt; God anoints it, and he just takes over. &gt;&gt; Like William was watching a Bible story, like a Lego Bible story. Daniel being thrown into the lion's den this morning. It's all dramatic. It's all stretched out and all these lines. It's all, you know, you know, to grip their attention. And I was looking at that, you know, with Christina. I said, "Now, it wouldn't have been like that at all. Just would have been." and and she said, "Yeah, it would have been so normal. He would have been put into the den. The anointing would have come down. Those lines just would have sat down been may maybe he would have tickled them or rode them around or it just wouldn't perfect peace. &gt;&gt; But it wouldn't have been like this. Probably at first he's like, man, well, this is the end, I guess. &gt;&gt; But then when God when the angel Lord came down and took over everything, &gt;&gt; it would have been just normal. &gt;&gt; But then when he came out of the den, he would have realized, man, that was something. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you see, he didn't call the angel into the den. &gt;&gt; God stepped in to prove his word. &gt;&gt; Right? And it's the same thing with you and I. We step into situations like, you know, we all know Christine's testimony would being, you know, I said, "That's just like you being surrounded by the three or four men and the dog on the path there when you, you know, before we were married." I said, "The den was just like that." She she realized I'm in trouble when they surrounded her on that path. But then the anointing came down. The angel, the same angel that came into the den came onto the path &gt;&gt; and she realized they can't touch me because I've got uncut hair and God's given me angelic protection because of that. &gt;&gt; And then what happened? They all froze. &gt;&gt; She pushed the dog out of the way and then started running walking down the path and ran home. But then when that all finished, she realized the magnitude of what happened, right? It would have been like that with Daniel. So many times you think about, well, what's going to happen when when these things and I can bind and loose? It'll just be another part of your day if I can put it that way. Cuz the anointing comes and takes over your life. &gt;&gt; So we can rest in all things, &gt;&gt; right? Just like the marts going to the stake. You say, "How on earth could they do that?" They're anointed to do it, &gt;&gt; right? Didn't matter what they were feeling beforehand, but during that whole process, they were like, "I'm here, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to see him soon." And God anointed them to overcome. &gt;&gt; But maybe thinking about it beforehand, after you think, man, how could I do that? How could that ever, you know, transpire? And how could you ever stand like that? It's because the anointing was there &gt;&gt; and carried them through. And brother Ram says that that same faith they had to overcome is the same faith we daily overcome with. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to I'm just going to finish with this these two quotes. Maybe we'll have the musicians up, please, and I'll just read these two quotes. We'll be done. We can have courage this morning. We face a defeated foe. Watch what he did. This is our Lord Jesus. When he was on earth, he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had. The royal seed, he promised it by the word. He conquered it. He conquered the gate of sickness for us. That's what he come to do. Remember, sick people, he conquered that gate. You don't have to conquer it. He conquered it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other men had to conquer their own gate. But you don't have to conquer. It's already conquered. He conquered the gates of sickness. And what did he do when he conquered the gates of sickness? Saying what he would, pardon me, whatsoever you ask on earth, whatsoever you bound on earth, I'll he'll bind in heaven. Give us the keys to the gate. He conquered the gate of temptation by the word. And the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you. He conquered it all. Conquered every sickness, conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered death and hell. He conquered what others couldn't conquer because they're of the natural seed. This is the spiritual seed. He conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification. And now we are more than conquerors. We just walk right into it as an inheritance. More than conquerors. Now we are dealing with a defeated enemy. Sickness is defeated. Death is defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything's defeated. Oh my. Wish I was twice my size. Now I'd feel twice as good. We are disputing with a conquered enemy. &gt;&gt; That's who you're disputing with this morning. He's already been conquered. He's already been whipped. You don't have to whip him. He's already been whipped for you. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, when the enemy comes and and tries to make you think it's a hopeless case and tries to make you dismayed and looked at the negative and what's the point of trying and what's the point of living anymore and all these things, that's a conquered foe talking to you. &gt;&gt; So, let's be of good courage this morning. &gt;&gt; We're going to take it all &gt;&gt; and then we'll go see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you, friends. Let's stand this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I guess we got to sing that song. Why would I be worried when giants come calling my name? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is so much bigger than the problems I faced. Why would I hunger for power or riches or faith? Oh my God is so much better than all [music] of these things.

There's no mountain to high, [singing] no to. [music] There's no I am. He doesn't know. There's no promise to do. There's no record to show.

They're going to take it all, Lord Jesus. And father, Lord, when we receive the Holy Ghost, when we cross that Jordan, that death to self, that's a sign we're going to get. Every promise, Lord, every part of the promised land, every part of our inheritance is ours. We thank you for this, my God. I pray we'd take courage this morning, Lord. May you strengthen the feeble knees, Lord. Lift up the hands that hang down. Dear God, may there just be such a courage from almighty from almighty God, Lord, from you into our lives, Lord Jesus, that we don't need to be dismayed or fearful that we can press the battle like never before, knowing in whom we have believed, Lord, knowing you, Lord, that you have conquered hell, death, and the grave. You have conquered it all for us, Lord. Just want to go forward and possess it in the name of Jesus Christ. So, Father, I pray you'd touch everyone here. Bless each one, dear God. Those who are streaming as well. Father, may there be such a confidence, such a courage in our hearts like never before because this is the season where we will possess every divine promise, all of our inheritance in you. We thank you, Lord. We have the great privilege of living in this season, Lord. We're not looking for one day someone will come and do it. Lord, we say thank you, Lord. You've placed us here, Lord God, that we can enjoy all that you are. We love you so much and thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. My last Isaac, I'll turn to you, bro. Amen. Can you give me an F? Do we know that song? Um, we are able to go up and take the country. Knows that one. I think it's F.
