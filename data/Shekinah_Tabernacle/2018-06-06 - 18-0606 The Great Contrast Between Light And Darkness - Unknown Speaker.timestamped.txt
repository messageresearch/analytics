[29:02] something special we've got a testimony
[29:05] from sister Robyn so we have that and in
[29:10] brother Ben we'll come up after that
[29:23] last week I came to Bible study at pokeo
[29:27] Bay and before I got there I had been to
[29:32] the specialist for my ankle and God had
[29:35] given me an earlier appointment and you
[29:38] know it was just a continuing saga and I
[29:40] was just I was sort of saying
[29:43] Ronnie Oh Lord I've done this and I've
[29:44] done that and I've done this and I've
[29:45] done that but Roubaix I knew I
[29:48] had to go and mum was going oh your foot
[29:50] is so saw you should stay at home you
[29:52] know and I'm thinking yeah I should
[29:53] really stay at home because it's
[29:55] starting to really hurt and then I
[29:57] thought known and I'm going to go and
[29:59] pick up sister Maggie and we're going to
[30:01] go to pick her obey and we had a time of
[30:04] fellowship going up to cook your real
[30:06] base sister a Maggie and I we just
[30:07] clicked like the sonnets it's really
[30:09] good it's wonderful to have a sister in
[30:11] the Lord and and then we got to put your
[30:15] real bait and I've by the time we got
[30:17] there I my my ball would make my ball my
[30:20] my ankle my whole foot was just like a
[30:23] ball of fire and the specialist had said
[30:26] to me when I give you this steroid
[30:29] injection and your ankle well he said to
[30:31] me this afterwards um
[30:33] alright you could feel discomfort for
[30:34] two weeks well I tell you what I could
[30:36] have chopped off my foot Anthony because
[30:40] it was just so so I could barely get up
[30:43] the driveway my tears running down my
[30:45] face and I got inside and I just sat
[30:47] down and I couldn't even sit with the
[30:49] weight of my league on my ankle it was
[30:51] just so so saw so I sat on the floor and
[30:54] I just said Lord you know what I can't
[30:58] do anything I can't do this
[31:02] you know this pain I can't do I can't
[31:05] accept it I'm not accepting it and I
[31:08] just surrendered everything to him you
[31:11] know it's just like I know that the Lord
[31:15] is my Savior I know that I can do
[31:19] absolutely nothing without him but you
[31:23] know when we were praying I just knew
[31:27] that it was just him just him anyway all
[31:33] of a sudden it was just like there was
[31:36] absolutely no pain in my ankle and I
[31:39] tell you I've been running up and down
[31:40] Bronwen stair so spiral stairs in the
[31:42] house I've been dancing I've been doing
[31:44] all sorts of silly things that I
[31:47] wouldn't normally have stepped forth and
[31:49] done because I've all you know I can't
[31:51] do this but I can do it through Christ I
[31:54] can do it and it's you know I can't wait
[31:57] for the perfect new body because this
[31:59] ankle is you know a pretty good
[32:01] indication of how it's going to be
[32:07] [Applause]
[32:16] praise the Lord I mean let's just stand
[32:19] shall we and um it's just seeing the
[32:21] course of I'm amazed just just a couple
[32:22] of times I mean it's good to see one out
[32:25] tonight

[32:35] amazed
[32:38] how you care
[32:42] through your precious blood I found
[32:47] pardon and my sins are washed

[33:16] how you care
[33:20] your precious blood I found
[33:27] and my sins
[33:32] they're all washed

[33:42] amen hallelujah I mean thinking
[33:46] musicians I mean praise the Lord they're
[33:48] all washed away
[33:49] I mean well god bless you all it's great
[33:52] to be home brother Albert has written
[33:55] his testimony at his testimony there's
[33:59] some on the front there then there's
[34:00] some on the shelf I'm halfway through
[34:02] and it's real good you'll be blessed
[34:04] he called it from vanity to sanity
[34:07] hallelujah amen but yeah you'll you'll
[34:10] be blessed if you if you read that amen
[34:14] let's turn to the Book of Luke if you at
[34:18] your Bibles handy yes I listen to
[34:21] brother Isaac service and I you know I
[34:23] enjoyed it I mean it's very interesting
[34:25] to see where a country comes from
[34:27] because how something starts is normally
[34:30] how it continues so you know you get to
[34:32] understand a people's makeup and
[34:34] character a nature in this day if you
[34:36] can trace back and see where they came
[34:37] from I mean so um yes it was good but so
[34:42] I'm going to take a scripture from that
[34:44] just tying it into our thought of where
[34:49] we are and in the in the latest in
[34:51] church age we're gonna go to Luke
[34:52] chapter 2 this is samuel marsden 'he's
[34:54] opening scripture well first text for
[34:57] the first service that was preached on
[34:59] these shores so this is i look to and
[35:04] verses 9 and 10 and then we're gonna go
[35:07] to Revelation chapter 8 it says in lo
[35:12] the angel is read from verse 8 rather
[35:16] and there were in the same country
[35:17] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[35:20] watch over their flock by night
[35:22] and lo the angel of Lord came upon them
[35:25] and the glory of the Lord shone around
[35:27] them and they were sore afraid and the
[35:30] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[35:33] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[35:35] which shall be to all people
[35:37] I mean I'm glad we can still read those
[35:40] same words hallelujah and let's go to
[35:43] revelations 10 we're gonna read verses 8
[35:45] to 11 we still have glad tidings of
[35:50] great joy like houses great joy not just
[35:53] joy but great joy amen
[35:56] revelations 8:2 11 it says here in the
[36:00] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[36:03] unto me again saying go and take the
[36:05] little book which is open in the hand of
[36:07] the angel which standeth upon the scene
[36:09] upon the earth and I went unto the angel
[36:11] and said unto him give me the little
[36:13] book and he said unto me take take it up
[36:16] and eat it take it and eat it up and it
[36:18] shall be in my belly bitter but it shall
[36:20] be in my mouth sweet as honey and I took
[36:23] the little book out of the Angels hand
[36:24] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[36:26] sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten
[36:28] it my belly was bitter and he said unto
[36:31] me thou must prophesy again before many
[36:34] peoples and nations and tongues and
[36:36] kings I mean let's just bow our heads in
[36:39] a word of prayer if you'd like to be
[36:40] remembered of prayer just want to raise
[36:41] your hand to the Lord just make your
[36:43] requests known and it's just pray

[36:56] shone around us father thank you Lord

[37:01] busyness of life but you've come into

[39:17] getting sick
[39:18] Eddie who I mean it's good to be home
[39:22] Rev lay so we read here in Revelations
[39:25] 10 we we see if we you know if you've we
[39:29] we have been going through this chapter
[39:30] and we we understand that that John is a
[39:34] you know the book of Revelation it's a
[39:36] book of symbols every one in the book or
[39:39] everything in the book of symbolic is
[39:41] symbolic of something and John himself
[39:42] as a as a symbol in the book just like
[39:45] we you know you read revelations for one
[39:47] after the church ages John CEOs the door
[39:50] I put in heaven and it's called come up
[39:51] hither and so it shows that at the end
[39:54] of the church ages as a rapture of the
[39:55] church where John represents a whole
[39:57] body of the redeemed that they go to
[39:59] meet the Lord in the air and so
[40:01] revelations 10 here when John is told to
[40:04] to take this book and to eat this book
[40:06] this represents an endtime people that
[40:09] become one with the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:11] and they are sent into all the world to
[40:13] preach the gospel that has been restored
[40:16] jesus said that this gospel must be
[40:18] preached to all nations then the end
[40:20] shall come but it's not a denominator
[40:22] still gospel but it's the the the
[40:25] original gospel that we have been
[40:26] restored to it must be you know the
[40:28] gospel is more than just preaching or
[40:31] teaching but it's the demonstration of
[40:33] the Holy Ghost power and power and signs
[40:35] and wonders God went with his apostles
[40:38] confirming his word it was more than
[40:40] them teaching the people that was God
[40:42] coming and behind that word and
[40:44] supernaturally vindicating this is me I
[40:46] mean I think we should just pray for
[40:48] brother Andy just now
[40:49] I just forgot with him so let's pray for
[40:51] him because he's on a supernatural
[40:52] mission
[40:53] I mean siliceous you don't mind breaking
[40:55] the order of service up a little bit I
[40:57] have a list bow our heads and pray let's
[40:59] all pray together for brother Andy
[41:00] gracious father Lord we pray for brother
[41:03] Andy and brother Adrian and Vietnam Lord
[41:06] Jesus we want to lift them into your
[41:07] presence by prayer we thank you Lord for
[41:09] the reports that are coming through
[41:11] father I just pray you're just group
[41:13] each soul Lord Lord that would come
[41:16] under the anointing Lord Jesus that
[41:18] hears the word that comes to the meeting
[41:20] group each soul Lord and birthed them
[41:21] into the kingdom
[41:22] father I pray Lord that each one of
[41:24] those souls is like your prophecy the
[41:26] Apostle Paul will go to one place and
[41:28] and get one convert it come back a year
[41:31] later and there's thirty from that one
[41:33] so lord I pray each soul that comes in
[41:35] Lord in these meetings Lord Lord may may
[41:37] 30 come from that one Lord may there be
[41:40] a mighty harvest in that part of the
[41:41] earth Lord may you be the apportion keep
[41:43] them safe Lord and may you just use them
[41:45] for your glory Lord may signs follow
[41:47] Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name for
[41:50] your glory supernaturally vindicate your
[41:52] word to each one there please may you
[41:54] grind up father we commit them into your
[41:56] hands in Jesus Christ name Amen
[41:58] I mean so it's a supernatural you know
[42:01] this gospel is a supernatural gospel
[42:03] it's more than just speaking things more
[42:05] than singing but God should come down
[42:08] and and vindicate it in your life right
[42:10] and so now the Apostle John we we know
[42:15] from history that that hears on the Isle
[42:17] of Patmos God revealed the book of
[42:19] Revelation God gave him the revelation
[42:21] but then after that he went back to
[42:23] Ephesus and he pastored the the church
[42:26] at Ephesus till he passed away he did
[42:28] not literally go through the world
[42:30] Emperor and preached before prophesy
[42:32] before many peoples nations tongues and
[42:35] kings
[42:36] right so John is a symbol in the book
[42:38] right and he's a symbol of you he's the
[42:40] he's a symbol of the end time bride
[42:42] so when so when we go you know we you
[42:45] know just like they've gone to Vietnam
[42:46] they're they're fulfilling the scripture
[42:49] where they've received tidings of great
[42:51] joy
[42:51] I mean we've received an open book
[42:53] everything that Adam and Eve lost has
[42:55] been restored
[42:57] I mean Dominion has been restored to
[42:59] Adams fallen race and Adams race is no
[43:02] longer fallen but we are redeemed
[43:04] I mean such tidings of redemption that's
[43:07] great joy we're no longer under this
[43:09] your slavery of the devil that's great
[43:12] joy we're a free people
[43:14] that's great joy there's Liberty among
[43:16] the redeemed I mean that's great joy I
[43:18] mean we're peace of fathers all
[43:20] understanding that's great joy I mean we
[43:23] have the good news it's not bad news or
[43:26] just mediocre okay news it's good news I
[43:28] mean that we can live above sin we can
[43:31] walk from this world to the next world I
[43:33] mean we can receive a full adoption to
[43:35] what the change of this body
[43:37] that's good news hallelujah I mean the
[43:40] win-win-win the devil and his angels are
[43:42] no more we shall still be amen that's
[43:46] real good news I mean I mean we've got a
[43:49] new heaven new earth to go to that's
[43:51] good news we shouldn't let these things
[43:53] become common to us I mean because you
[43:55] look at what are you aiming for in life
[43:57] i Manning for a rapture
[43:59] I meant raise up a child in the way they
[44:03] shall go when they're old they shall not
[44:05] depart
[44:06] what were you raising your children you
[44:08] should be raising them there's a body
[44:09] change for you there's an adoption for
[44:11] you I mean there's are there's a new
[44:13] heavens in you or fear you should fire
[44:16] them that way not just be good people
[44:18] and whatever more that's all part of it
[44:20] but what's the main goal I mean we
[44:23] should be having eternal goal right so
[44:26] if tidings of great joy
[44:27] now it's strange that in the state that
[44:30] we live in there are great tidings of
[44:32] joy gods among us God's and his people
[44:35] once again I mean he comes and dwells in
[44:37] human flesh once again it's incredible
[44:39] you think the creator of heavens and
[44:41] earth comes and dwells in people Amen
[44:45] you should see it believe you say I see
[44:47] God with skin on
[44:48] right I hope that's not too strong but
[44:51] but that's true I mean when you saw the
[44:53] Apostles after the upper room you say I
[44:55] see God with skin on right hallelujah
[44:59] and then that life just keeps spreading
[45:00] through from generation to generation
[45:02] when you saw Timothy you say I should
[45:04] you should well see I saw God with skin
[45:06] on right and it should be the same thing
[45:09] amen when you look at yourself in the
[45:11] mirror you should be able to go back
[45:13] into your testimony and say God one day
[45:15] you put skin on me or rather you'd well
[45:17] that mean I've got skin on and me amen
[45:21] hallelujah because God comes and dwells
[45:24] in his church and it's God being the
[45:25] Christian in us so it's an incredible
[45:29] time of of of great joy and it's also an
[45:33] incredible time of light I mean let's go
[45:36] to Matthew chapter four I'm gonna I'm
[45:38] going to kind of contrast two things
[45:40] darkness and light because it's a time
[45:43] of great light it's also a time of great
[45:45] darkness but we shouldn't despair at the
[45:48] darkness that it has to be there so here
[45:55] we are in Matthew chapter four and we'll
[46:01] go from verse 12 now when Jesus had
[46:05] heard that John was cast into prison he
[46:08] departed into Galilee and leaving
[46:10] nazareth he came to dwell thing and came
[46:12] and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the
[46:15] Seacoast and the borders of Zebulun
[46:17] epsilen that it might be fulfilled which
[46:19] was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
[46:21] the land of Zebulun and the land of
[46:23] Netherland by the way of the sea beyond
[46:25] jordan galilee of the gentiles the
[46:27] people which sat in darkness saw a great
[46:29] light and to them which said in the
[46:31] region and shadow of death light has
[46:34] sprung up from that time Jesus began to
[46:37] preach and say repent for the kingdom of
[46:39] heaven is at hand
[46:40] so he it was here was God you know Jesus
[46:44] Christ now he goes to these places
[46:46] because they had to be fulfilled that
[46:48] light would spring up upon these people
[46:50] they were sitting in darkness here they
[46:52] who you know you're they were there they
[46:54] had their families they had their
[46:56] religion they had their occupations they
[46:58] had what you know everything of life but
[47:00] they're sitting in darkness
[47:01] but then light had come to them and we
[47:04] understand from the scripture that Jesus
[47:06] himself says in the book of John that
[47:08] job John the Baptist he was a bright and
[47:11] shining light and you're willing for a
[47:13] season to walk in his life and we know
[47:15] that John was the fulfillment of
[47:17] Scripture he was the voice that you know
[47:19] was crying in the wilderness to prepare
[47:21] the way of the Lord he was fulfilling
[47:22] Scripture and so when God fulfills
[47:25] Scripture it is light right it is light
[47:27] for the people to walk in a mint so if
[47:30] you take the opposite of it it's
[47:31] darkness I mean so to to accept what God
[47:35] is doing in your day and is light it
[47:37] helps you see it helps you walk you know
[47:40] we have to go you know where you are all
[47:43] right so now it is a time just like in
[47:46] the first coming of Jesus Christ it was
[47:49] a time of great light more than a
[47:51] prophet was there God Himself was there
[47:53] and it was a time of great light now
[47:57] when light comes it actually causes the
[48:00] darkness to come together just before
[48:03] dawn there's always it's always the
[48:05] darkest just before dawn because the
[48:07] light is about to come over the horizon
[48:09] and as it comes over the horizon it
[48:11] pushes the darkness together in a way so
[48:15] it's always darkest just before dawn so
[48:17] now here was here was the Lord coming
[48:19] these people were sitting in darkness
[48:21] but then now light sprang upon them
[48:24] where they could actually see those are
[48:26] who were deign to see could see they
[48:29] said this is more than a man from
[48:30] Galilee or Nazareth this is God this is
[48:33] the Messiah just like the woman of the
[48:35] well she had her life she had her
[48:37] problem she had her ideas of things we
[48:39] know we Messiah cometh he'll do these
[48:41] things and we should worship here and
[48:43] worship here and whatever more but hey
[48:46] you're the Messiah was standing speaking
[48:48] to her and then she you know he says to
[48:51] her go get your husband I have done
[48:53] that's right you've had five the one you
[48:54] with us not yours and she says we know
[48:57] when Messiah cometh he'll do these
[48:59] things and she just he just says to her
[49:01] he that speaks to the as he so what
[49:05] happened light came into Samaria her
[49:07] life was different because the light got
[49:08] turned on hallelujah and she didn't go
[49:11] back to darkness her whole
[49:13] life was changed because of that one
[49:15] moment a man brother don't see the light
[49:17] struck the cedar came to life Oh wasn't
[49:20] that a wonderful moment I'm speaking
[49:23] about you don't just talk about her
[49:25] that's Gloria now talk about you you
[49:27] should be able to see yourself in the
[49:28] scripture wasn't that a wonderful moment
[49:30] it was a wonderful moment I was there my
[49:33] headphones at University in my room with
[49:35] headphones on scared my flatmates who
[49:37] had no kind of faith who come and bust
[49:39] me listening to these servants and
[49:40] office could God God spoke to me I had
[49:44] to surrender everything but God spoke to
[49:45] me I had to be an Anglican Church
[49:48] Presbyterian Church a boarding school
[49:49] three times a week all this stuff then
[49:52] speak to me one but I heard a voice good
[49:54] morning friends I'm gonna speak about
[49:56] Redemption and completeness and enjoy
[49:58] the seal of God why so many failed to
[50:00] keep the victory all that really spoke
[50:02] to me hallelujah so now there's also our
[50:07] time so but we understand you're from
[50:10] the first coming of Jesus now the light
[50:13] has to react to the darkness what's it
[50:17] going to do and we know ultimately the
[50:20] darkness rejects the light and they
[50:23] crucified him that was in the first
[50:25] coming now let's go to numbers chapter
[50:28] 20 because here we have an account
[50:34] I thought we'd read it instead of me
[50:37] just just according it but Moses Moses
[50:40] is called to bring forth water numbers
[50:45] 20 verse 7
[50:50] this is in the Lord spake unto Moses
[50:53] saying take the rod gather the other
[50:55] sembly together down Aaron though
[50:57] brother and speak ye unto the rock
[51:00] before their eyes and it shall go give
[51:04] forth as water and thou shalt bring
[51:06] forth to them water out of the rock so
[51:09] thou shall give the congregation and
[51:11] their Beast drink and Moses took took
[51:15] the took the rod from before the Lord as
[51:17] he commanded him and Moses now and
[51:20] gathered the congregation together
[51:21] before the rock and he said unto them
[51:24] hear now ye rebels must we fetch you
[51:27] water out of this rock and Moses lifted
[51:29] up his hand and with this rod he smoked
[51:32] the rock twice and the rock sorry and
[51:35] the water came out abundantly and the
[51:38] congregation drank and their beasts also
[51:41] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[51:43] because he believed me not to sanctify
[51:45] me in the eyes of the children of Israel
[51:48] therefore ye shall not bring this
[51:49] congregation into the land which I've
[51:51] given them so they he was said speak to
[51:54] the rock it will bring forth water but
[51:56] in his anger he took us right and he
[51:58] smote it twice and brother Brahim says
[52:00] the whole plan was broken right there
[52:03] but he had to but the rock is Christ he
[52:06] says I am the bread of life which came
[52:08] down from heaven I mean he was that rock
[52:10] in the wilderness he was the breath as
[52:12] the brass ever was lifted up soul being
[52:14] lifted up he was that in time he was all
[52:17] those things in type so but he had to be
[52:20] smitten twice because he's actually been
[52:21] crucified twice right so he was smitten
[52:25] there on Calvary that was his first
[52:26] crucifixion but then there is a second
[52:29] crucifixion in this day that's what I'm
[52:31] talking about
[52:31] yeah there was a great contrast today
[52:33] there's great light and there's great
[52:34] darkness
[52:35] so there's tidings of great joy but also
[52:38] there's darkness you know in this time
[52:40] so he was he was smitten once on Calvary
[52:45] but he had to be smitten twice now and
[52:46] so in order to qui se we can't crucify
[52:49] how can you crucify Jesus in this hour
[52:51] you kill US influence among the people
[52:54] right that's how you crucify someone
[52:56] again you make them a no effect because
[52:59] you can't kill a spirit a spirit can't
[53:01] die right it's eternal
[53:04] died and his body Amen is up in heaven
[53:06] she can't physically crucify him beacon
[53:09] but you can't crucify his effect among
[53:11] the people right Jesus said to the
[53:14] scribes and Pharisees by teaching the
[53:16] commandments and traditions of men you
[53:17] make the Word of God Norfolk to the
[53:19] people so that's how crews a fight you
[53:21] just teach the commandments and
[53:22] doctrines of men above the Word of God
[53:24] and you make the Word of God no effect
[53:26] so for example the effect of the law
[53:28] should have been you possessed the
[53:30] fullness of the land one will chase a
[53:32] thousand to chase 10,000 that was meant
[53:35] to be if they were living according to
[53:37] God's Word in the land that should have
[53:38] been happening right but there they were
[53:41] they had forgotten you know they didn't
[53:43] even have a testimony like Gideon if God
[53:45] is with us were the miracles and that
[53:47] trying to politically hold together
[53:49] their country and you know the scribes
[53:51] the Pharisees having meetings what shall
[53:52] we do they're worried that the Romans
[53:54] would come and take their nation away in
[53:56] a little political minded there is no
[53:58] power of God among them well will it
[54:01] happen because the Word of God was now
[54:02] affected them anymore the same the same
[54:06] word that Moses received I mean was the
[54:09] same word they had if they stripped away
[54:12] all the tradition it was still there in
[54:13] his purity right but because they added
[54:16] the commandments doctors made to make
[54:17] the Word of God no effect and so here
[54:22] was the one who gave the law he was
[54:25] standing now in flesh you read Matthew
[54:27] chapter 5 he says you've heard of all
[54:29] time thou shalt not commit adultery but
[54:32] I say unto thee he that looks upon a
[54:33] woman to lust after her has committed
[54:35] adultery in his heart already and he
[54:38] said thou shalt not murder but I say
[54:40] unto you he that looks angrily at his
[54:41] brother that of causes committed murder
[54:43] already he was the lawgiver he magnified
[54:46] the law he magnified it amen and the
[54:50] reason he magnified it because he was a
[54:51] greater grace on the scene his fullness
[54:53] of grace and truth right he magnified
[54:57] the law he was the one that spoke to
[54:59] Moses he said to them before Abraham was
[55:01] I am
[55:01] and they wanted to kill him when he
[55:04] really reveals who he is and so they
[55:06] took him and there they crucified him
[55:09] okay and and the same thing is repeated
[55:13] in this day
[55:17] now he is been rejected for Creed's and
[55:21] dogmas we read an au in it yeah and the
[55:25] latest in church age says Jesus says
[55:27] behold I stand in the door and knock
[55:30] revelations 3 and 20 if any man hear my
[55:33] voice and open the door
[55:35] I'll gone to him and sup with him and he
[55:37] with me so where is he he's on the
[55:39] outside of the church world trying to
[55:41] get back in it's not one of the saddest
[55:44] scriptures in the entire Bible he's not
[55:47] even in where he should be worshiped
[55:48] he's been kicked out the outside because
[55:50] they've taken creeds and dogmas in
[55:51] tradition and they've taken that and
[55:54] they've kicked out the pure Word of God
[55:57] what's happened he's been crucified he's
[56:00] been thrown on the outside of the church
[56:03] say well that's awful bad it has to be
[56:09] this way
[56:10] no brother branch says in the indictment
[56:12] he preaches the indictment I and I'd
[56:14] this generation for the second
[56:16] crucifixion of Jesus Christ if you wanna
[56:18] hear something sobering you should go
[56:19] listen to that one he says it could not
[56:22] have been done a few years ago I say 50
[56:26] years ago it could not have been done
[56:28] but today this is very timely and it
[56:32] could not have been done maybe 10 years
[56:34] ago but it can be done today because
[56:37] time has run out so he sees it couldn't
[56:42] be when when he preached in 1963 he said
[56:44] it couldn't mean done 10 years ago why
[56:46] cuz the fullness of all that God was was
[56:48] now upon the earth right and the son of
[56:51] man ministry there it was and said now
[56:53] now he says now they can crucify him and
[56:56] he says I cry indict this generation for
[56:59] the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[57:02] now this has to happen because history
[57:06] has to repeat itself history has to
[57:09] repeat so what happened in the first
[57:11] coming has to repeat in the second
[57:12] coming so in the first coming there was
[57:15] a there was a messenger that introduced
[57:17] that that called the people out a
[57:19] denomination out of their out of their
[57:21] systems turn their hearts to receive the
[57:25] Messiah that's what John the Baptist hid
[57:27] that's what his job was to introduce
[57:29] Jesus
[57:30] to the people he says behold the lamb of
[57:32] God take away the sin of the world he
[57:34] introduced them right he introduced them
[57:37] and then after that John said I must
[57:39] decrease he must increase John went off
[57:41] the scene and now the people walking
[57:42] with the Lord they meant and there's the
[57:46] same thing with a brother Brando here's
[57:48] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[57:50] of the world showing Jesus Christ in the
[57:51] scripture of the mystery of God is
[57:53] finished in this hour we know who he is
[57:55] we know what he likes we know what it
[57:57] doesn't like we know the correct
[57:58] approach to him we know how to serve him
[58:00] right we're not guessing he pointed out
[58:03] the Lamb of God in Scripture taking away
[58:04] all the Creed's they meant and now but
[58:08] that same God that was that was
[58:10] introduced through the Prophet is still
[58:11] here they meant that same Pirlo far as a
[58:15] mango hallelujah that same God is still
[58:17] here the Holy Ghost we feel among us is
[58:20] the same God that was back there I mean
[58:23] he hasn't left us we're not just
[58:25] fighting it out ourselves but God
[58:27] Himself is leading us into a rapture
[58:29] giving us rapturing faith in his word a
[58:31] man that's what we have we're not
[58:34] waiting for something else to come it's
[58:35] already here I mean the revivals already
[58:38] here the quick sure will work upon the
[58:40] earth is already here
[58:41] amen he's up enough all of heaven is
[58:44] upon the earth all that Jesus is is here
[58:47] amen I happen to believe that I mean
[58:51] there's not an eighth messenger to come
[58:53] right it's not in Scripture there's two
[58:56] that are going to Israel but I'm not
[58:58] part of the Jewish nation I'm a Gentile
[59:00] so then I'm not called

[1:00:05] a healing there that's glorious or a bit
[1:00:07] of deliverance honestly a body change
[1:00:09] that's the full victory I mean that a
[1:00:12] people would be taken from this world be
[1:00:14] washed and sanctified and transform and
[1:00:16] God would take them from this world to
[1:00:18] the next world that's what I want to see
[1:00:20] that's why he died for me hallelujah

[1:00:41] victory that's what that's not why he
[1:00:45] died he want to see a full he wants a
[1:00:46] people completely redeemed on streets of

[1:01:11] do it hallelujah and we have eternal
[1:01:14] life this is glorious jesus paid it all
[1:01:17] but it's all done what he made had told
[1:01:19] that all that's wonderful hallelujah
[1:01:22] amen so now he's on the outside he's
[1:01:27] been crucified again but this has to be
[1:01:30] so and it's not actually the darkness
[1:01:33] sometimes we may be this is me but
[1:01:36] sometimes we think now the darkness is
[1:01:38] doing this the darkness is making this
[1:01:41] world so bad or whatever you want to
[1:01:44] call and ensure but it's the light is
[1:01:47] ultimately in control just like when
[1:01:49] Dawn is coming it's not the darkness
[1:01:52] making yourself darker it's because
[1:01:53] light is shining
[1:01:55] right light is shining that's why it
[1:01:58] becomes dark is not because the darkness
[1:01:59] decides I'm going to be darker now
[1:02:01] there's a greater force that's making it
[1:02:03] come together now let's go to let's go
[1:02:08] to the Book of Luke and we're going to
[1:02:13] go to Luke 23 now before we read there
[1:02:19] I'm sure we can all agree there's a
[1:02:22] great uniting going on in the world
[1:02:23] there's a great uniting politics is
[1:02:27] coming together you see all the you see
[1:02:30] all the countries coming together
[1:02:32] you see religion coming together not
[1:02:35] just within Christendom but other
[1:02:37] religion and interfaith day a dialog has
[1:02:40] never been so great then it is in this
[1:02:42] hour where the we can see a rabbi in or
[1:02:45] you're a Catholic priest Orthodox
[1:02:47] Buddhist whatever it may be they all
[1:02:49] come together say we are one because
[1:02:53] what's happening things are being pushed
[1:02:55] together and and groups that were never
[1:02:58] friends maybe Buddha enemies a few years
[1:03:00] ago now they've become friends why is
[1:03:03] this because light shining right I'm
[1:03:07] going to show you this to you in the
[1:03:08] scripture here and Luke chapter 23
[1:03:10] because it you know as I as I mentioned
[1:03:12] before that history is repeating itself
[1:03:17] history is repeating it's what you see
[1:03:19] in the first crucifixion you see again
[1:03:22] today Luke 23 verses 6 to 12 the Empire
[1:03:29] lit so this is during Jesus's
[1:03:31] crucifixion this is when he's on trial
[1:03:34] when Pilate heard of Galilee because he
[1:03:39] just found out that Jesus was from
[1:03:40] Galilee he asked whether the man were
[1:03:43] Galilean and as soon as he knew that he
[1:03:45] belonged under his jurisdiction he sent
[1:03:48] him to hear it who himself also was at
[1:03:51] Jerusalem at that time and when here at
[1:03:53] saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he
[1:03:56] was desires to see him for a long season
[1:03:58] because he had heard many things of him
[1:04:01] and he hoped to have seen some miracle
[1:04:04] done by him then he questioned with him
[1:04:07] and many
[1:04:07] woods but he answered him nothing and
[1:04:09] the chief priests and scribes stood and
[1:04:12] vehemently accused him and hear it with
[1:04:15] his men of war set him at naught and
[1:04:17] mocked to me and arrayed him in a
[1:04:19] gorgeous robe and sent him again to
[1:04:22] Pilate and the same day Pilate and Herod
[1:04:24] were made friends together for before
[1:04:27] there are M natee between themselves so
[1:04:31] them crucifying Jesus made them friends
[1:04:34] these ones who are who ever teased us
[1:04:38] they had nothing to do with each other
[1:04:39] but by crucifying in the midst of the
[1:04:42] crucifixion of the of the rejection of
[1:04:44] the of the Living Word and that day made
[1:04:47] them come together as friends they were
[1:04:49] friends after this right and you go back
[1:04:52] in time and you see the World Council of
[1:04:54] Churches come up around the same time as
[1:04:56] Rho becomes a nation brother Brahmas as
[1:04:58] you're sent to the earth with the
[1:05:00] Ministry of Eleazar to get a bride for
[1:05:02] Jesus Christ our Isaac and then so
[1:05:04] there's the is the World Council of
[1:05:06] Churches come up and then as the seals
[1:05:08] as the word is coming up in a 96 is 3 to
[1:05:11] 65 around that same time the the Vatican
[1:05:14] is having a Vatican Council called
[1:05:16] Vatican 2 and their main thrust is it
[1:05:19] communica lism interfaith they'll
[1:05:22] dialogue how can we extend a a a hand to
[1:05:26] two denominations and different
[1:05:28] religions so what's happening now
[1:05:30] there's a gathering going on as God is
[1:05:33] calling as bride revealing himself to
[1:05:35] call his bride to himself now the world
[1:05:38] now the Vatican and the World Council of
[1:05:40] Churches they're coming together well
[1:05:43] what's happening there's been a
[1:05:44] rejection there's been a crucifixion and
[1:05:46] that crucifixion causes ones who once
[1:05:49] enemies to come together as friends amen
[1:05:54] but and then also they reach a hand out
[1:05:57] to the Muslims and to the Buddhists and
[1:05:59] to the Hindus and different religions
[1:06:02] and now we're all one big happy family
[1:06:05] this is where we are he said well how
[1:06:08] did this happen because this happened
[1:06:10] this repeated itself that's why this is
[1:06:13] happening that's why maybe I've seen it
[1:06:15] well I have seen it before
[1:06:16] we should bow when you see well what's
[1:06:18] going on in the world this is the new
[1:06:21] paper it's all in here this is the
[1:06:24] newspaper you got to read the message
[1:06:26] it's the newspaper
[1:06:27] he's a local correspondent saying this
[1:06:29] is what's going on in your day amen
[1:06:34] he sees this and the Misses shalom i
[1:06:38] read to two different quotes he sees the
[1:06:42] difference it's just like it was in the
[1:06:45] beginning this is speaking about Genesis
[1:06:47] 1 now when there's gross darkness upon
[1:06:49] the earth and the Spirit of God moved
[1:06:51] upon the face of the water said let
[1:06:52] there be light and God separated the
[1:06:54] light from the darkness I believe we are
[1:06:56] now living in that hour again that when
[1:06:59] God is separating light from darkness
[1:07:00] and he's pressing it to the other side
[1:07:02] of the world
[1:07:03] that the light might be made manifest
[1:07:05] and the church the reason I'd say
[1:07:08] shallow which is God's peace to them is
[1:07:11] because that's that it's God's peace and
[1:07:13] that's what I want to bring you this
[1:07:15] morning for the new years not looking
[1:07:17] back but we're looking forward to the
[1:07:19] breaking of a new day until there's
[1:07:21] something great laying ahead of us where
[1:07:23] the years have been the joy that we'll
[1:07:25] have looked forward to depressing the
[1:07:27] coming of the great light and now we see
[1:07:30] it breaking over the horizontal
[1:07:31] horizontal realm
[1:07:33] it's breaking between mortal and
[1:07:35] immortality we see it breaking between
[1:07:37] heavens and earth from an earthbound
[1:07:39] sickness and trouble world and to a
[1:07:42] bright shining day of immortal life and
[1:07:44] an immortal body amen an immortal earth
[1:07:47] that shall never pass away it's Shalom
[1:07:49] and to the peace I mean I mean unto the
[1:07:52] church now it's light time coming for
[1:07:55] the believers but a gross darkness for
[1:07:57] the people
[1:07:58] amen there was a 1964 Shalom God's peace
[1:08:03] rest upon you hallelujah amen
[1:08:07] don't worry nothing's out of cater
[1:08:09] nothing's nothing's goin at God's in
[1:08:12] control this isn't the same message he
[1:08:17] sees in the same message a little bit
[1:08:18] later this is where I really want to get
[1:08:20] to the darkness is separating itself
[1:08:22] from the light God's causing it the
[1:08:25] lights doing it see the lights pressing
[1:08:28] itself in such a way until the darkness
[1:08:30] has to congregate together right they
[1:08:34] had a chance to accept it and they
[1:08:36] wouldn't do it so it's condensed itself
[1:08:38] and they do that by putting the church
[1:08:41] together and the Council of Churches and
[1:08:43] uniting it with the pagan darkness what
[1:08:46] happened and what happened there in the
[1:08:48] first crucifixion his Pilate here's the
[1:08:51] Sanhedrin and he's herod amen his
[1:08:55] religious power political power pagan
[1:08:58] power all comes together right
[1:09:01] it's congregating together because they
[1:09:04] didn't accept it they didn't accept
[1:09:05] Jesus this would never have happened if
[1:09:07] they accepted him right
[1:09:09] but it's the light that's doing it now
[1:09:15] and when they and when they so firmly
[1:09:18] disagree with one another but yet they
[1:09:20] had to go together to make the night
[1:09:22] come upon the people Isaiah 60:1 arise
[1:09:24] shine for though for the light has come
[1:09:26] to your rise and shine the light has
[1:09:28] come the word light has vindicated again
[1:09:31] the light vindicated again God's word so
[1:09:33] that you can see God manifested in his
[1:09:35] promise of the light of the day or the
[1:09:38] word given to this age see these
[1:09:40] promises that's been made for this day
[1:09:42] these promises that was said by the
[1:09:44] prophets and Jesus himself said in this
[1:09:46] day God in Sandero times Hebrews one God
[1:09:49] in sundry times and divers manners spake
[1:09:51] to their fathers through the prophets
[1:09:53] but in the last days through His Son
[1:09:56] Jesus Christ see that great light that
[1:09:58] hung in the wilderness which was that
[1:10:00] was with Makka that was which was that
[1:10:03] Moses were suck egypt esteeming the
[1:10:05] reproach of Christ greater treasures
[1:10:07] than that of Egypt the same one that met
[1:10:09] Saul on the road to Damascus a great
[1:10:11] light hung before him that same light
[1:10:13] same pillar of fire Saul
[1:10:15] being a Hebrew would never worship any
[1:10:17] spirit or anything of cool at Lord in
[1:10:19] the position here then he said Lord who
[1:10:21] are you he said I'm Jesus jesus said I
[1:10:23] have come from God I go to God that same
[1:10:26] light has come - what to manifest to
[1:10:28] make known to the people the promises
[1:10:30] that he's made for this day manifested
[1:10:33] light of the day the darkness is
[1:10:35] darkened when he come here's the light
[1:10:37] of the day they were supposed they were
[1:10:40] supposed to come a messiah and he came
[1:10:42] just exactly like God said he did would
[1:10:44] come and when he did what was at the
[1:10:46] light of the day
[1:10:47] press the darkness against him is that
[1:10:49] right he had to give us life that that
[1:10:52] light would continue could shine he was
[1:10:54] the light of the day but why was he the
[1:10:55] light of the day he was the vindicated
[1:10:57] way that have been spoken made manifest
[1:11:01] soshe's us the light coming together
[1:11:03] these ones I mean the darkness
[1:11:04] congregating itself together because
[1:11:06] it's rejected the light that's exactly
[1:11:09] what sits the lights doing it right the
[1:11:12] lights causing the darkness to come
[1:11:14] together they meant this is repeated
[1:11:17] itself again hear it hear it and pile it
[1:11:22] in our friends right this has been
[1:11:25] fulfilled we have God and full circle
[1:11:27] and really when brother Brown was saying
[1:11:29] about the World Council of Churches you
[1:11:31] know you darling itself at the pagan
[1:11:33] darkness many of the great churches
[1:11:34] weren't in the World Council of Churches
[1:11:35] at that time not like it is today they
[1:11:38] weren't in there but now they're all in
[1:11:39] there and then maybe I should have put
[1:11:42] the video up but I'll send you a link of
[1:11:44] of that Anglican bishop Tony Palmer and
[1:11:46] he go speaks to a Kenneth Copeland's
[1:11:48] ministers meeting and he has a message
[1:11:50] from the Pope saying now we're all
[1:11:52] friends and Anna Lutheran Church has
[1:11:54] already signed a a joint declaration of
[1:11:57] faith with the Catholic Church then the
[1:11:59] then the Methodists did that that same
[1:12:02] thing a few years after that
[1:12:03] this is history already and then now
[1:12:06] he's talking to the charismatic switch
[1:12:07] were the Pentecostals evolved into the
[1:12:10] charismatic movement he's speaking to
[1:12:11] the charismatic movement saying now
[1:12:13] Luther's protest is over as yours who
[1:12:16] seen the video what's happening darkness
[1:12:19] the Pentecostal church brother and says
[1:12:21] I come to you because you're the you
[1:12:23] know you're the only ones you would
[1:12:24] sponsor my meetings initially then they
[1:12:26] kick them out and he was sitting there
[1:12:28] in Tucson since I've been here for for
[1:12:31] over a year and not one of you has
[1:12:32] invited me to come and speak in your
[1:12:33] church I've been trying to get in why it
[1:12:36] hit the manifest behold I stand at the
[1:12:38] door and knock you see that they were
[1:12:40] rejecting the man they're rejecting the
[1:12:41] word that was coming through the man
[1:12:43] they were ejecting the message Jesus
[1:12:44] Christ and so now here he is saying
[1:12:47] Luther's protest is over as yours and
[1:12:49] these shows a video from the Pope and
[1:12:52] the post way you know see is basically
[1:12:54] we're long-lost brothers and then
[1:12:57] Kenneth consonant stands up and then in
[1:13:00] the rooms full of thousands of men
[1:13:01] and they have very big congregations
[1:13:03] they represent tens of thousands of
[1:13:05] people and Kenneth Copeland says now the
[1:13:07] man said we should pray for him
[1:13:09] let's pray from he says to Tony Palmer
[1:13:12] can you take a video of my response back
[1:13:14] to the Pope and he basically says now
[1:13:16] we're friends we're brothers we've
[1:13:18] prayed for you you pray for us we'd like
[1:13:20] to cut and then after that they arranged
[1:13:22] the meeting and a whole bunch of them
[1:13:23] big delegation we knew and and met the
[1:13:25] Pope what's happening darkness is coming
[1:13:28] together darkness because they rejected
[1:13:32] the light God's are doing it the lights
[1:13:36] doing it amen because the tears have to
[1:13:38] be bound for the burning amen but the
[1:13:42] weak is to be gathered to the Ghana and
[1:13:44] the reason I say these things is not to
[1:13:47] say well those people are like that
[1:13:49] I say you should rejoice that we're free
[1:13:52] amen that we are not connected to a
[1:13:54] system we're connected to Jesus Christ
[1:13:56] the word holy that we do not serve God
[1:13:59] through a system we serve them according
[1:14:01] through his word now we have a real
[1:14:03] genuine personal relationship with him
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:07] I trust you the reason you're a
[1:14:08] Christian this night is not because of
[1:14:10] mommy or daddy or some tradition is it
[1:14:12] because you meet God yourself I mean the
[1:14:14] light came upon you the angel of the
[1:14:16] Lord came the glory of the Lord came
[1:14:18] around you like the Shepherd's it says
[1:14:20] don't fear I mean I give you tidings are
[1:14:22] exceedingly great joy because your
[1:14:25] Messiah is present Jesus Christ is here
[1:14:27] I mean to take you from this world to
[1:14:29] the next world hallelujah glory to God
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:36] the light is doing it you know it's
[1:14:39] interesting maybe we'll just read this
[1:14:42] what's the time in my in my Scofield
[1:14:47] Bible now the the references don't
[1:14:49] always go but when it speaks about
[1:14:52] prophesy again before many nations
[1:14:54] Kindred's and tongues it speaks about it
[1:15:03] goes to Jeremiah 25 and let's let's just
[1:15:08] go to Jeremiah 25 let's just read this
[1:15:19] and then will and will close its amazing
[1:15:27] Jeremiah Jeremiah was called the weeping
[1:15:29] prophet he saw the destruction coming
[1:15:35] and he spent his whole life trying to
[1:15:37] get the people back to serve God and he
[1:15:41] died in Egypt with the remnant he told
[1:15:44] them who's read the Book of Jeremiah
[1:15:46] that's where he ends up Babylon comes as
[1:15:49] was prophesied takes the people away
[1:15:52] he's allowed to stay in the land and
[1:15:54] then the governor who's there to look
[1:15:56] after the people he gets killed then the
[1:15:58] rest of them panic and say let's go down
[1:15:59] to Egypt we'll be safe there and
[1:16:01] Jeremiah says don't go you'll be
[1:16:03] destroyed down there and they take him
[1:16:04] down there
[1:16:05] and he dies in Egypt what a what a life
[1:16:09] to live but he and they came a point in
[1:16:14] his life he said he will not he said I
[1:16:16] will not speak now this is not what we
[1:16:17] were about to read he says I'm not gonna
[1:16:19] speak about this anymore god I will not
[1:16:21] be this prophet anymore they said it was
[1:16:23] like fire in his bones he had to speak
[1:16:25] he had to speak friends we are in a way
[1:16:30] like Jeremiah we don't rejoice
[1:16:34] I don't rejoice when I see darkness
[1:16:36] right I don't say the people deserve it
[1:16:39] or whatever more I feel sad for them I
[1:16:42] feel sad for this world this world has
[1:16:45] so much potential and yet it's in the
[1:16:47] gutter but you know that doesn't mean we
[1:16:51] should be quiet we should live a life
[1:16:54] you say well I can't preach us them and
[1:16:56] live a sermon live a life in front of
[1:16:59] people live a life better that you'll be
[1:17:01] salty and they may say it's something
[1:17:03] about that person I may not understand
[1:17:06] it but something different they mean be
[1:17:10] salty now Jeremiah Jeremiah 25 15 he
[1:17:19] sees for thus saith the Lord God of
[1:17:21] Israel unto me take the wine cup of this
[1:17:25] fury at my hand and cause all nations to
[1:17:29] whom I send thee to drink it and they
[1:17:32] shall drink
[1:17:33] can be moved and be mad because of the
[1:17:35] sword I will send among them then I then
[1:17:38] took either Cup at the Lord's hand and
[1:17:40] made all the nations to drink unto whom
[1:17:42] the Lord had sent me to now let's stop
[1:17:46] here
[1:17:46] he didn't literally have a physical cup
[1:17:48] in his hand and then go to every Nations
[1:17:50] they drink the strength let's drink this
[1:17:52] right this is a word he's gonna release
[1:17:54] that's going to cause us to happen okay
[1:17:57] - what Jerusalem and the cities of Judah
[1:18:00] and the kings thereof and the princes
[1:18:01] are off to make them a desolation and
[1:18:04] astonishment a hissing and a curse and
[1:18:06] it is this day Pharaoh king of Egypt and
[1:18:09] his servants and his princess and all
[1:18:10] those people and all the mingled people
[1:18:12] and all the people of the land of us and
[1:18:14] and all the kings of the land of the
[1:18:16] Philistines and ashkelon and Ezra and
[1:18:20] Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod and Edom
[1:18:24] and Moab and the children of Ammon and
[1:18:26] all the kings of Tyrus and all the kings
[1:18:29] of Zion and the kings which are many of
[1:18:33] the Isles which are beyond the sea
[1:18:34] d-down and team iron buzz and all that
[1:18:38] are in the out of most corners and all
[1:18:40] the kings of Arabia and all the kings of
[1:18:42] the mingled people that dwell in the
[1:18:44] desert and all the people I mean so all
[1:18:46] the kings of summary and all the kings
[1:18:48] of Elam and all the kings of the Medes
[1:18:52] and all the kings of the north near far
[1:18:54] and near one with another and all the
[1:18:56] kingdoms of the world which are upon the
[1:18:58] face of the earth and the king of XI
[1:19:02] shash shall drink after them therefore
[1:19:06] thou shalt Santa diem beside the Lord of
[1:19:09] Hosts the Lord the God of Israel drinky
[1:19:11] and be drunken and spew and fall and
[1:19:13] rise no more because the sword which I
[1:19:16] will send among you and it shall be if
[1:19:19] they refuse to drink of the cup at thine
[1:19:21] hand but to take the cup of on hand to
[1:19:24] drink then thou shalt say unto the umber
[1:19:26] said the Lord of hosts ye shall
[1:19:28] certainly drink so he preached the
[1:19:32] message now this is probably a big segue
[1:19:34] but I was but he preached the message
[1:19:37] and he caused this all to happen by what
[1:19:40] he preached right but even even if with
[1:19:43] all that going on his ministry was still
[1:19:46] fictive what he was called to do now we
[1:19:49] are not here to preach judgment upon the
[1:19:51] world our ministry is different right
[1:19:54] our ministry is a Ministry of
[1:19:56] deliverance of rapture I mean of of
[1:19:59] redemption of a full adoption the change
[1:20:02] of the body
[1:20:03] that's how that's our ministry right all
[1:20:06] of us are in that ministry so but you
[1:20:09] see now this world is falling apart
[1:20:12] the reason this world is falling apart
[1:20:14] is because the bride is coming into
[1:20:17] order with their bridegroom there's a
[1:20:20] lauren in physics called the second law
[1:20:22] of thermodynamics where everything tends
[1:20:26] to entropy or disorder right and it's
[1:20:29] not only a certain amount of order in
[1:20:31] the universe so when something comes to
[1:20:34] order something has to go to disorder is
[1:20:36] equilibrium right so now the reason this
[1:20:39] world is falling apart is because
[1:20:41] there's a people coming into order there
[1:20:46] can't be two kingdoms here at the same
[1:20:48] time Daniels vision said that when it
[1:20:52] comes to the feet of iron and iron and
[1:20:54] clay which is where we are the Roman
[1:20:56] Roman Empire has gone to all the world
[1:20:59] right it's spread brother Brown when he
[1:21:01] saw thee when he saw the Soviet Soviet
[1:21:04] Union and and and and and four other
[1:21:06] said light yo nations of them and then
[1:21:10] America and then then for other nations
[1:21:11] then they had a peace you know a
[1:21:13] conference and the premier of the Soviet
[1:21:15] Union took offers sure and banged it on
[1:21:17] the podium and brother and said look
[1:21:19] we're at the feet cuz iron hat
[1:21:22] you know Eisenhower means I am
[1:21:23] Khrushchev with the premier of Soviet
[1:21:25] you means clay the iron and the clay
[1:21:27] can't mix and this whole world is united
[1:21:30] but it's very much divided because iron
[1:21:33] and clay doesn't mix all that well
[1:21:34] partially strong partially weak he says
[1:21:38] we're at the end and then what happens
[1:21:40] when you're at the end then as the rock
[1:21:42] comes cut out the mountain without hands
[1:21:44] strikes the image in the feet and it
[1:21:47] gets it gets spread oh yeah breaks it
[1:21:49] into powder and it scattered us no more
[1:21:51] then that rock becomes a great big
[1:21:54] mountain fills the whole earth that's
[1:21:55] the kingdom of God hallelujah
[1:21:59] where are we we're in that process right
[1:22:01] that's why this world is falling apart
[1:22:03] I'll be honest it's later than you think
[1:22:07] you know we booked Forest Lakes for Nix
[1:22:11] 2019 labor weekend in 2020 but in my
[1:22:16] mind a thing that we probably might not
[1:22:17] be here we might not be here I say Lord
