[7:02] [Music]
[9:49] all right good morning
[9:51] everyone welcome to the house of God
[9:53] this
[9:56] morning feel like a robot
[10:02] hey it's just wires and they just like
[10:06] plug in you turn up here and you plug
[10:08] all these wires into
[10:11] yourself be putting little chips on us
[10:13] next
[10:16] day unplugged would be nice like
[10:20] just a real piano it plays on you know
[10:24] when the little when the when you push
[10:26] the key it has a little lever that goes
[10:29] sweeps forward and it goes Twang and
[10:31] hits an actual string and
[10:34] goes and a guitar that praise the
[10:38] Lord let's um let's um stand this
[10:42] morning
[10:44] and let's forget about Earthly things
[10:46] and let's enter into spiritual things
[10:48] this morning that's what we
[10:52] um desire to do is that the inner man
[10:55] would be renewed and
[10:57] refreshed the inner man we're all we all
[11:00] this this guy here is just the just the
[11:02] um he just carries the inner man around
[11:05] he's not really part of the whole
[11:07] equation
[11:10] and what we desire is that our soul
[11:12] would be be enriched by the spirit of
[11:15] God this morning and by the word of God
[11:17] that's what we desire and and if our
[11:21] hearts are expecting then that's what
[11:23] we'll receive from the Lord we'll be
[11:26] refreshed we'll be encouraged
[11:29] our heart that God made will be changed
[11:31] in a way that only God can do he's a
[11:34] he's a master
[11:35] phys you know we have complex issues in
[11:38] our lives and things we're dealing with
[11:39] that we don't know the solution for but
[11:42] God knows the solution for everything
[11:45] and he can orchestrate our life in a
[11:47] Divine way we just change
[11:51] situations and it might be just a word
[11:53] that someone said here and then
[11:55] something we saw here and these things
[11:56] are all happening and we don't realize
[11:58] but it's changing in a whole situation
[12:00] in our lives it's changes the way that
[12:01] we think outside of us even knowing
[12:04] anything God is orchestrating this
[12:06] complex thing called life to work
[12:08] perfectly for our benefit in every
[12:11] situation and and that's why I've got a
[12:14] confidence in God and that's why I have
[12:15] no confidence in myself because I
[12:18] realize I don't have the ability to
[12:20] actually maneuver and to change things
[12:22] why bother let's just let God be in
[12:24] control and and trust in him let's have
[12:28] um brother Chris cuz he just peered over

[53:44] of God which is given to me for you to

[53:58] made uh would make known what is the
[54:01] riches of the glory of this mystery
[54:03] among the Gentiles which is Christ in

[55:21] well and we ask Lord that you'd have
[55:23] Lord you'd receive all honor glory and
[55:25] praise Lord this day in Jesus Christ's
[55:28] name amen amen amen God bless you
[55:31] friends you may have your seats this
[55:32] morning um I'd like to just take a
[55:35] little thought about Christ in you the
[55:37] hope of glory now notice the Apostle
[55:39] Paul when he is writing this out he does
[55:41] not say that it is religion in you the
[55:44] hope of glory or a group of collection
[55:46] of man's ideas or theories of morality
[55:49] or correct Doctrine or a knowledge of
[55:51] historical events but Christ in you the
[55:54] anointing in you right and we know that
[55:57] Christ means the anointed or the
[55:59] anointing that's right amen so Christ in
[56:02] you is the life of God the Living Word
[56:04] manifested in you amen it is Christ as
[56:08] Christ has been revealed down Through
[56:09] the Ages is that same one revealed in
[56:12] you amen so now when you know you know
[56:16] we're living in a day where where where
[56:19] the bride has come to its manifestation
[56:22] you know as as there were two there was
[56:24] a man and a woman in the Garden of Eden
[56:26] and they were one flesh and and they
[56:28] were part of each other so down through
[56:31] the Old Testament after the fall God
[56:33] rebuilt the man and that man is Jesus
[56:35] Christ but then there also has to be the
[56:37] the the Redemption of the woman so there
[56:39] has to be a second Eve so now as as and
[56:42] from Calvary down to now the the second
[56:45] Eve has been manifesting down through
[56:47] the church ages and now we have come to
[56:48] a time where we're not just manifesting
[56:51] Christ in part but Christ in fullness so
[56:53] it's not just part of the word living
[56:55] it's now the fullness of the word is
[56:57] manifested in the people hallelujah so
[57:00] you know so so if we talk about Christ
[57:02] in you the hope of glory it is the word
[57:05] made manifest in you amen it's more than
[57:08] just being anointed because you know as
[57:10] I said the word Christ means the
[57:12] anointing or the anointed so people can
[57:15] be anointed but we have to be more than
[57:18] just be Anointed with the Holy Ghost now
[57:20] we're going to I'm going to show you
[57:21] this quickly but you know Jesus when he
[57:24] came you know he went to the river a
[57:26] Jordan and he was baptized and it says
[57:28] in Luke 3 and 21 and 22 and verse 22 it
[57:32] says and the Holy Ghost ascended in a
[57:34] bodily shape like a dove upon him and a
[57:36] voice from Heaven which said Thou Art my
[57:38] beloved Son in thee I'm well pleased and
[57:41] then in Luke 41 it says and Jesus being
[57:43] full of the Holy Ghost returned from
[57:46] from Jordan and was led by the spirit
[57:48] Into the Wilderness and and the Apostle
[57:51] Paul would would would write in the book
[57:53] of Colossians not in the piece we've
[57:54] just read but he said but in the
[57:56] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in
[57:58] Jesus Christ so all that God was he
[58:00] poured into Christ he he wasn't he
[58:02] wasn't manifesting God in in in a
[58:05] partial way like you see Christ was in
[58:07] Moses in part Christ was in Joseph in
[58:10] part he was in David in part he was in
[58:13] Jeremiah in part all the Believers down
[58:15] through the Old Testament they were
[58:17] manifesting part of God but God became
[58:20] flesh the fullness of the word became
[58:22] flesh and dwelt Among Us that's why the
[58:24] fullness of God was in Christ but then
[58:27] brother Braham says all that God was he
[58:29] poured himself into Christ and all that
[58:31] was in Christ is poured into the church
[58:33] is poured into you Hallelujah so now we
[58:35] are not just a you know we're not here
[58:37] haphazardly we're not Believers
[58:39] haphazardly but we are part of him we're
[58:41] part of his word and we're called to
[58:43] manifest a part of the scripture all
[58:45] lighted to us hallelujah so as I said
[58:48] now we can be anointed but there are as
[58:50] it says in Matthew 24 and 24 Jesus is
[58:54] speaking of these last days that there
[58:56] shall arise many false christs and false
[59:00] prophets and they shall show forth great
[59:02] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[59:04] were possible they shall deceive the
[59:07] very elect amen so so he's saying so so
[59:10] notice he's not saying false jesuses
[59:12] even yet there are people in the world
[59:14] that say they are Jesus but that
[59:16] wouldn't full a real believer amen it
[59:18] wouldn't bring into question of you know
[59:20] if I stood here and said I am Jesus
[59:22] Christ you'd say this place is crazy and
[59:24] you walk out the door iust you would
[59:27] right but then if someone comes along
[59:28] and says they're anointed they're the
[59:30] man of the hour with power you know you
[59:32] know then you got to be wary with that
[59:34] because it says that there are many
[59:36] false Christ or false anointed ones so
[59:39] the anointing is genuine but the
[59:41] vessel's not true that's right right so
[59:43] they are falsely they are false vessels
[59:45] with a true anointing and this is this
[59:48] is where the dangerous part comes in and
[59:51] a classic example of this is balum you
[59:53] got to look at everyone's motive and
[59:54] objective balum when know was was hired
[59:57] by Moab to try and curse Israel as as
[59:59] Israel was journeying from Egypt to the
[1:00:01] promised land and the king of Moab knew
[1:00:03] that he could not defeat Israel with his
[1:00:05] armies so he had to come a different way
[1:00:07] so he went and hide balum and asked him
[1:00:09] can you curse these people that that you
[1:00:12] know that we can have Victory so balum
[1:00:14] was a genuine prophet he knew he had the
[1:00:18] right approach to God he he offered the
[1:00:21] same sacrifices that Israel sacrificed
[1:00:24] seven Bullocks and seven Rams different
[1:00:25] things he had the right approach to God
[1:00:28] but his but his motive in worshiping God
[1:00:31] wasn't pure his motive was to get
[1:00:35] money amen and that's why when I was
[1:00:37] writing this down I asked you know I
[1:00:39] kind of asked myself the question I
[1:00:40] asked you the same question when we come
[1:00:42] to worship God why are we worshiping him
[1:00:45] amen because many people have a lot of
[1:00:47] different motives but you know you got
[1:00:49] to have the right motive our motive
[1:00:51] should be Lord I worship you cuz you've
[1:00:53] be you've called me you've you've
[1:00:55] redeemed me you've washed me in your
[1:00:57] blood your your your I am here to be
[1:00:59] made in your image I mean I've been here
[1:01:02] to be made in the image of your word and
[1:01:04] that's why I worship you because of what
[1:01:06] you've done for me not what I can get
[1:01:08] out of him Hallelujah but balum balum
[1:01:11] had a genuine gift it says in if you
[1:01:13] read from Numbers 22 to 25 is the
[1:01:15] account of balum and it says the spirit
[1:01:18] of the Lord it said the spirit of God
[1:01:20] Came Upon him and he prophesied and his
[1:01:23] prophecies are still reading true today
[1:01:26] so the so the gift in him was was right
[1:01:29] but the vessel was wrong because the
[1:01:31] vessel was looking for material gain
[1:01:33] instead of actually standing for the
[1:01:35] promised word of the day because if he
[1:01:38] was a real genuine Prophet as in a true
[1:01:40] vessel he would have joined him with
[1:01:42] Moses saying you know God has called you
[1:01:45] and and the promise of the day is that
[1:01:47] Israel will go into the promised land
[1:01:49] what can I do to help God's program not
[1:01:52] work against God's program but work for
[1:01:54] his program and that's why it's so V you
[1:01:57] know so vital that we know God's program
[1:02:00] for our day which I'm not going to go
[1:02:03] into but you know we don't want to be
[1:02:05] working against what God is doing
[1:02:07] brother B said people are praying and
[1:02:09] fasting for Revival but but yet working
[1:02:11] right against it we don't want to fall
[1:02:13] into that category amen so he was
[1:02:16] worshiping God to get uh material gain
[1:02:20] to get money so that's the same question
[1:02:22] now what is our motivation are we a
[1:02:25] believer that we'd get influence over
[1:02:26] people have a little kingdom you can
[1:02:29] have one person following you you've got
[1:02:31] a kingdom it's very small but you can
[1:02:33] have an influence human influence over
[1:02:35] someone and what you've got a kingdom is
[1:02:37] that why we're Believers that we can
[1:02:39] influence different people control them
[1:02:41] under our Humanity amen is it that we
[1:02:44] can have some kind of social standing
[1:02:46] among people or is it because what he's
[1:02:49] done for us is it because we're part of
[1:02:51] his word that's why we worship Him
[1:02:54] Hallelujah so we want to be we want to
[1:02:56] look at our motive and objective
[1:02:59] amen now if we go to the um if we go to
[1:03:04] the book of Hebrews chapter 10 we're
[1:03:05] just going to read a bit
[1:03:07] more Hallelujah is everyone feeling
[1:03:11] good amen Hebrews 10 and
[1:03:20] 4 it says for it is not possible that
[1:03:24] the blood of balls and of goats should
[1:03:25] take away sins wherefore when he cometh
[1:03:28] into the world he saith sacrifice and
[1:03:31] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[1:03:33] hast thou prepared me and burn offerings
[1:03:35] and sacrifices for sin thou Hest no
[1:03:38] pleasure then said I lo I come in the
[1:03:42] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:03:44] to do thy will oh God above when he said
[1:03:47] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[1:03:48] offerings and and offering for sin thou
[1:03:50] wouldest not neither hadst thou pleasure
[1:03:53] therein which are offered by the law
[1:03:56] then he said lo I come to do thy will oh
[1:03:59] God he taketh away the first that he may
[1:04:01] establish the second by the which will
[1:04:04] we are Sanctified through the offering
[1:04:06] of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
[1:04:08] then he said then said I lo I come in
[1:04:11] the volume of the book it is written of
[1:04:13] me to do thy will oh God Amen now we
[1:04:17] know this is speaking of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:20] saying he has come I come in the volume
[1:04:23] of the book written to me to do thy will
[1:04:26] so it was already recorded what he would
[1:04:29] do amen when when our lord Jesus when
[1:04:32] God became flesh and his Earthly
[1:04:34] Ministry happened it was already
[1:04:36] prophesied what he would do and he
[1:04:38] fulfilled many Prophecies of the Old
[1:04:40] Testament many types many you know you
[1:04:43] can look into the you know the even the
[1:04:44] order of the Tabernacle and the
[1:04:46] different sacrifices they appointing to
[1:04:48] Christ amen so now but our Lord he knew
[1:04:52] what was written it was written already
[1:04:54] what he would do
[1:04:56] so when he was walking upon the Earth
[1:04:58] because remember he was a man he was the
[1:05:00] god man right he was fully God but he
[1:05:03] also fully man cuz he had to be a man in
[1:05:05] order to be our kinsman redeemer to
[1:05:07] redeem us back to God but he had to be
[1:05:09] God because only God could do the job
[1:05:11] right so so as a man now he had to he
[1:05:15] walked according to the prophecy that he
[1:05:17] had to fulfill he told his disciples
[1:05:19] many time for this cause I've come into
[1:05:21] the world I'm going to be given over to
[1:05:22] sinful men they'll you know they will
[1:05:24] kill me by third day I rise again he
[1:05:27] know he told these things to the to his
[1:05:29] disciples cuz he knew why he was there
[1:05:32] because the word wasn't sealed to him I
[1:05:34] mean the book the book wasn't the book
[1:05:37] wasn't sealed to him it was very clear
[1:05:39] when he went into the synagogue of
[1:05:40] Nazareth among his own people and he and
[1:05:43] he opened to the book of Isaiah he
[1:05:45] wasn't just looking for something cool
[1:05:46] to say or something to tickle their ears
[1:05:48] he found in the place where was written
[1:05:50] the spirit of laws upon me and he began
[1:05:52] to read the prophecy that was in the Old
[1:05:54] Testament and says this day this
[1:05:57] scripture is fulfilled in your ears am
[1:05:59] mean he wasn't making making any guesses
[1:06:01] he was declaring that he was the
[1:06:03] physical manifestation of that prophecy
[1:06:06] am mean that the people would know I am
[1:06:08] here to fulfill this word hallelujah so
[1:06:11] he wasn't guessing he knew who he was
[1:06:14] and brother Braham said that Jesus had
[1:06:16] perfect Faith because he knew who he was
[1:06:19] amen and that's what this message has
[1:06:21] come to do is that you would know who
[1:06:24] you are amen amen that you are not just
[1:06:26] some random person stumbling around this
[1:06:29] world Amen but Jesus said all that the
[1:06:31] father has given me will come to me and
[1:06:34] all that will come to you are in no wise
[1:06:36] cast out that's why this message is a
[1:06:38] supernatural call am mean to gather
[1:06:41] God's seed to himself Hallelujah we
[1:06:44] think sometimes we stumble into it you
[1:06:46] know I was listening to brother Braham
[1:06:47] here saying that you know sometimes
[1:06:49] Heaven just kind of bumps into us you
[1:06:52] know we just bump into this realm that
[1:06:53] we don't really know anything about A
[1:06:56] Hallelujah because you know we can't see
[1:06:58] the
[1:06:59] supernatural many of us some can see
[1:07:01] visions and things but you know many of
[1:07:03] us we feel the presence of God but we
[1:07:05] don't see the pillar of fire come down
[1:07:07] necessarily that doesn't mean he's not
[1:07:09] here amen right amen amen it's like
[1:07:11] brother B said about a blind man blind
[1:07:13] man never seen the son before born blind
[1:07:16] but he goes out he feels a sun rise upon
[1:07:18] his skin but someone he can say what is
[1:07:20] that doing that to me and someone who
[1:07:21] can see and say that is the Sun in the
[1:07:23] sky that is why you feel that that way
[1:07:26] it's the same thing we've had a Prophet
[1:07:27] come in this generation to declare that
[1:07:29] he is here I mean the Holy Ghost has
[1:07:31] been poured out amen he said he you know
[1:07:34] the pillar of fire was there in the
[1:07:35] meetings God was present we didn't many
[1:07:38] people never saw him but but he had eyes
[1:07:40] to say that's the Sun and then people
[1:07:42] say oh now I know what that feeling is
[1:07:44] upon me it's God hallelujah it's the
[1:07:47] same thing with us amen the spirit of
[1:07:49] God comes down you may be in your car
[1:07:51] may be anywhere God will come and meet
[1:07:53] you Hallelujah and you say the sun is
[1:07:54] shining cuz I feel it's affecting my
[1:07:57] life Hallelujah I'm glad we don't we
[1:08:00] don't follow a historical being I mean
[1:08:03] someone who's somewhere far away died in
[1:08:05] 1965 or God left the scene there no the
[1:08:08] son of man is present upon the Earth
[1:08:10] Jesus Christ is here hallelujah so now
[1:08:14] it says when it says the book written of
[1:08:15] me that word written means a uh that
[1:08:19] that is that is uh that is uh especially
[1:08:21] to write figurative figuratively to
[1:08:24] describe so it's a book that is written
[1:08:27] to describe me Hallelujah that's what
[1:08:29] he's talking about written of me it it
[1:08:31] was describing him what he would do and
[1:08:34] as I said the Lord knew exactly the
[1:08:38] parts that described him that's why he
[1:08:40] could walk with a to on the way way to a
[1:08:42] m for 6 hours he said now this is where
[1:08:45] it's written of me to do this and this
[1:08:46] and this and this and I'm like this and
[1:08:48] he went through all the types and
[1:08:49] shadows all the prophecy cuz he knew
[1:08:51] what he us to fulfill now this has to
[1:08:54] become the same with us
[1:08:56] amen that the Bible you know brother
[1:08:58] Braham said when the seals came open
[1:09:00] when the Seven Seals came open the Bible
[1:09:03] became a new book he never said that it
[1:09:06] was a different
[1:09:08] translation right but the truth in its
[1:09:10] fullness became manifested because
[1:09:13] brother man said the the seals are
[1:09:15] Christ amen they are Christ so Christ
[1:09:18] became unveiled he became unsealed that
[1:09:21] now we don't see him in obscurity
[1:09:23] anymore but we see him as he is
[1:09:26] hallelujah just like when you look into
[1:09:28] the scripture and you can spend a
[1:09:30] lifetime look people debate how to get
[1:09:32] baptized how much water lack of water
[1:09:34] sand all kinds of things age you know
[1:09:37] people go all kinds of things but then
[1:09:40] brother you know the prophet came it
[1:09:42] says baptize in the name of the father
[1:09:45] son Holy Ghost what's the
[1:09:47] name father's not a name son's not a
[1:09:50] name Holy Ghost is what he is but what's
[1:09:52] the
[1:09:53] name and and for nearly 2,000 years
[1:09:55] people have just skipped over the word
[1:09:58] name why cuz it's obscured but now it's
[1:10:01] become clear well what is the name Jesus
[1:10:03] said I come in my father's name you
[1:10:05] receive me not what's the name of the
[1:10:06] father Jesus all the family in Heaven
[1:10:08] and Earth is name Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:10:11] Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:13] and gives the name repent and be
[1:10:15] baptized every one of you for remission
[1:10:16] of sin and be baptized in the name of
[1:10:18] Jesus Christ am H and you shall receive
[1:10:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost it's quite
[1:10:22] simple they don't contradict one
[1:10:24] interprets the other amen
[1:10:27] hallelujah amen so now so so the Bible
[1:10:29] became plain and so now with us we
[1:10:33] should be able to look into the
[1:10:34] scripture and say I come in the volume
[1:10:37] of the book it's written of me
[1:10:40] hallelujah amen we should be look into
[1:10:42] the scripture say this book describes me
[1:10:45] amen that's why we can go to Ruth and I
[1:10:47] trust you see yourself in Ruth
[1:10:49] Hallelujah you see yourself when Joseph
[1:10:52] is revealing himself to his Brethren his
[1:10:54] Gentile bride already in the palace amen
[1:10:57] speaking of the Gentile bride is taken
[1:10:58] up in the Rapture when he comes and
[1:11:00] reveals himself to the Jews amen Moses
[1:11:02] took a gentile bride I'm sure you can
[1:11:04] see yourself in there Hallelujah where
[1:11:07] Christ is manifesting himself down
[1:11:08] through the scripture you should be able
[1:11:10] to see you amen but the thing is you
[1:11:13] have to go beyond the veil of tradition
[1:11:16] I mean you have to go beyond the veil of
[1:11:17] just well this is the message this is
[1:11:19] church this is how it is and really meet
[1:11:21] him you for yourself I mean cuz when you
[1:11:23] really step into his presence become one
[1:11:26] with him am mean it it it doesn't become
[1:11:28] common the word doesn't become common am
[1:11:31] mean when the pot of Mana was put in the
[1:11:33] holy of holies it never went off it was
[1:11:35] fresh every generation every time a high
[1:11:38] priest went into partake of that Mana it
[1:11:40] was still fresh the word was still fresh
[1:11:42] in the shikina Glory Hallelujah it's the
[1:11:45] same thing when this word is placed in
[1:11:47] your soul and God abides amen not it's
[1:11:50] not common it doesn't become just some
[1:11:52] casual thing that that you become
[1:11:54] indifferent to and you begin to look
[1:11:55] around now it becomes richer and greater
[1:11:57] and deeper Hallelujah I trust that's
[1:12:00] your experience yes sir
[1:12:03] amen hallelujah you know we were reading
[1:12:06] a couple of days ago about zakus just at
[1:12:10] home and zakus wanted to see Jesus for
[1:12:13] who he was it says in the scripture
[1:12:15] Hallelujah that's a good way to be amen
[1:12:18] but he climbed up the sycamore tree and
[1:12:20] he wanted to try and look down on him
[1:12:22] you can't look down on the word to see
[1:12:25] him for who he is remember he was the
[1:12:27] shortest man in the city so Jesus said
[1:12:29] come down you're looking at me the wrong
[1:12:31] way cuz if you look down you're looking
[1:12:33] at a critical angle you can't look at
[1:12:36] Jesus you can't look at the message in a
[1:12:38] critical way and see the son of man amen
[1:12:40] you got to come down off that tree and
[1:12:42] look up at him Hallelujah and then when
[1:12:44] you re look up because when he came down
[1:12:46] and look up at him he said Lord you know
[1:12:50] if I've done anything anyone any wrong
[1:12:52] I'll restore it for fold I'll give half
[1:12:54] my goods to the poor and now then Jesus
[1:12:56] because he was looking at him right then
[1:12:58] Jesus says now salvation has come to
[1:13:00] your house hallelujah thank he wasn't
[1:13:03] just a Man from Nazareth to zakus
[1:13:05] anymore amen I trust that this word is
[1:13:08] not just a oh it's a Bible and a message
[1:13:10] and no it's God revealing himself Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ amen so so our lives I trust when
[1:13:18] you look into the
[1:13:19] scripture amen I trust that that that
[1:13:23] your life no long longer is obscure but
[1:13:26] it becomes plain yes Hallelujah I me
[1:13:29] when the angel came to brother brah and
[1:13:30] commissioned him to take the two gifts
[1:13:32] of healing to the world the gift of
[1:13:34] healing and discernment to the world to
[1:13:35] start the post World War II healing
[1:13:37] Revival which he did history documents
[1:13:39] it he said he said the purpose I've come
[1:13:42] is to explain your peculiar birth and
[1:13:45] your misunderstood life so the angel
[1:13:47] came to him to give him Clarity in the
[1:13:49] scripture what his purpose on the Earth
[1:13:52] was so he wasn't know cuz other
[1:13:54] ministers said St you know these visions
[1:13:55] of there of the devil and all these
[1:13:57] things and he was all influenced by
[1:13:59] man's opinion he wasn't sure who he
[1:14:02] really was but then the Lord had to come
[1:14:03] himself I mean to show him in the
[1:14:06] scripture who he was so after that he
[1:14:08] wasn't tossed to and fro anymore but he
[1:14:11] knew who he was because God himself came
[1:14:14] and showed his position in the word amen
[1:14:17] and it has to be the same thing with you
[1:14:20] that God comes and anoints this book to
[1:14:23] your life Hallelujah that that the cross
[1:14:26] is no longer a story or a tradition it
[1:14:28] becomes a reality amen that you know in
[1:14:31] your soul he took your sins up Calvary
[1:14:34] that day and you bear them no more
[1:14:35] because they're nailed to his cross
[1:14:37] Hallelujah what's happening he's giving
[1:14:39] you Clarity in the scripture of who you
[1:14:41] are amen that as I quoted the scripture
[1:14:44] Jesus said all that the father has given
[1:14:45] me will come and when it becomes a
[1:14:47] reality you know you're one of them
[1:14:49] Hallelujah that's why you've come that's
[1:14:51] why he's revealed himself to you am mean
[1:14:53] because he's giving you because you
[1:14:54] begin to realize you know my dad's from
[1:14:57] Cape Town my mom's a
[1:14:58] kiwi I'm I was born and raised here but
[1:15:02] ultimately this is not me this is just
[1:15:04] where I was born that's just my natural
[1:15:06] lineage that's right amen nothing
[1:15:08] against those things but that doesn't
[1:15:10] give me stability in this life cuz
[1:15:12] culture can change opinion can change
[1:15:14] man can change and then if I don't know
[1:15:16] who I am in in the Lord then I'll just
[1:15:19] I'll toss to and fro with those things
[1:15:21] right but if I know who I am if God has
[1:15:23] revealed himself to me in his word it
[1:15:26] doesn't matter what comes or what goes I
[1:15:28] can stand sure saying I know in whom I
[1:15:30] have believed Hallelujah and then so it
[1:15:33] has to be the same thing with us the
[1:15:35] Lord has to come himself and reveal
[1:15:37] himself to you in the word that you know
[1:15:40] who you
[1:15:41] are
[1:15:43] hallelujah oh God
[1:15:48] granted amen
[1:15:51] now so it says in Genesis 1 and one in
[1:15:55] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[1:15:57] the Earth period in verse two and the
[1:16:00] Earth was without forn void and darkness
[1:16:03] was upon the face of the deep and the
[1:16:05] spirit of God moved upon the
[1:16:07] waters now that same one says in John 1
[1:16:12] And1 in the beginning was the word and
[1:16:14] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:16:16] God and verse 14 and the Word was made
[1:16:19] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:16:21] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:16:24] begotten of the father father full of
[1:16:26] grace and truth so the same one that
[1:16:29] created all things became flesh Amen in
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ now this may be Elementary
[1:16:35] but it's very vital because he didn't
[1:16:38] just become flesh in him he has to
[1:16:41] become flesh in you amen right the same
[1:16:44] God that became flesh in Jesus Christ
[1:16:46] has to become flesh in you that's right
[1:16:48] because if we're Christians we're
[1:16:49] Christlike amen and the only way to
[1:16:51] really be Christlike is that he comes
[1:16:53] into you and lives his life out of you
[1:16:55] otherwise we're just being a mimic
[1:16:57] otherwise we're just being a carnal
[1:16:59] impersonation but if he comes in if his
[1:17:02] word his Living Word comes and dwells in
[1:17:04] you amen it's no longer you living as
[1:17:06] Paul says but Christ that liveth in me
[1:17:09] Hallelujah his word his word's got to
[1:17:11] put on
[1:17:12] flesh
[1:17:14] amen that's what it's got to do you see
[1:17:16] the Apostle Paul when when Jesus said
[1:17:19] that he was a light to the Gentiles so
[1:17:21] so Jesus so the scripture said that
[1:17:23] Jesus is a light to the Gentiles
[1:17:25] but then God comes to the Apostle Paul
[1:17:27] on the road to Damascus Christ comes to
[1:17:29] him reveal you reveals himself to the
[1:17:32] Apostle Paul and then a few years later
[1:17:35] the Apostle Paul says I'm the light to
[1:17:36] the Gentiles why is that because it was
[1:17:39] the same Ministry in Jesus Christ is now
[1:17:41] in the Apostle Paul amen and then now
[1:17:43] the life that the Apostle Paul then
[1:17:46] lived wasn't his own life anymore what
[1:17:49] he once was he no longer was he was no
[1:17:51] longer the Pharisee am mean he he was no
[1:17:54] longer leaning on man's organization to
[1:17:56] further his status in the church you
[1:17:59] following me because he was a Pharisee
[1:18:01] of the Pharisees he used his own ability
[1:18:04] to become something within his
[1:18:05] organization and he was leaning upon his
[1:18:07] organization to further what he wanted
[1:18:09] to do he went to the high priest before
[1:18:11] he went to Damascus he got letters he
[1:18:13] got Authority from the high priest to
[1:18:14] find any Christians in Damascus to put
[1:18:17] them in Chains and bring them back he
[1:18:18] was leaning on man's influence to
[1:18:21] further his own cause but then when he
[1:18:23] met God himself amen he wasn't worried
[1:18:26] about Jerusalem he wasn't worried about
[1:18:28] the high priest and being a Pharisee he
[1:18:30] had his commission from God himself amen
[1:18:32] and so as God led him he walked
[1:18:35] Hallelujah and then he came to the end
[1:18:37] of his well near the end of his ministry
[1:18:39] he says you know he says I was not
[1:18:41] disobedient to the heavenly vision am me
[1:18:43] so what God called him to do he was
[1:18:45] faithful to that call amen and because
[1:18:49] he had a Christ centered life he didn't
[1:18:51] have a Pharisee centered life no more or
[1:18:54] the opinion of the Church centered life
[1:18:55] he had a Christ centered life amen and
[1:18:59] therefore he could stand against any
[1:19:02] opposition and he was Victorious
[1:19:05] remember Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:19:07] it's more than just nice phrase it's got
[1:19:09] to be a
[1:19:10] reality thank you Lord hallelujah now
[1:19:13] brother B says in the deity of Jesus
[1:19:15] Christ he says the deity of him who who
[1:19:17] is he some of them thinks he's a little
[1:19:20] baby back there he's the one that stood
[1:19:21] on the invisible platform uh raped out
[1:19:24] his hands and spoke and said let there
[1:19:26] be light and there was light that was
[1:19:27] Jesus Christ he was in the world and the
[1:19:30] world was made by him and the world
[1:19:31] recognized him not he was he was the
[1:19:34] deity of God look what he did back there
[1:19:36] talk about the miraculous back there you
[1:19:38] talk about shouting when he performed
[1:19:40] the miraculous things to make things
[1:19:41] which are now out of things which are
[1:19:43] not he spoke and it was so and that same
[1:19:46] power that same Christ Hallelujah let
[1:19:49] the fundamentalists let them people who
[1:19:50] deny the power of God say it's wrong but
[1:19:53] that same power that spoke the world
[1:19:54] into existence is in those people that's
[1:19:56] got the Holy Ghost that's right men and
[1:19:59] women it's time we found out who you are

[1:20:08] trod down something amen you're you're
[1:20:12] not you're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:20:14] deity is not in heaven it's in you
[1:20:17] Hallelujah you I know you think I'm
[1:20:19] crazy but let me tell you something

[1:20:27] human being he stood back there he's the
[1:20:29] creator of all things he made life frogs
[1:20:31] and all these ducks chickens animals
[1:20:33] created everything and nothing was made
[1:20:36] by what was made by him who Christ the
[1:20:38] deity he brought down the plagues in the
[1:20:40] days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the
[1:20:43] mouths of lions he quenched the violence
[1:20:44] of fire they escaped the edge of the
[1:20:46] sword they raised the Dead from the
[1:20:48] grave who Christ oh my what would it be
[1:20:51] who is it Christ the deity and brother
[1:20:54] sister that deities in you a little
[1:20:56] while the world seeth me no more yet ye
[1:20:58] shall see me for I'll be with you even
[1:21:00] in you to the end of the age Christ in a
[1:21:02] Manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're
[1:21:05] not worshiping Christ in the manger but
[1:21:07] Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of
[1:21:08] Life Hallelujah the Creator God himself
[1:21:11] dwelling in the human being it does not
[1:21:14] yet appear what we shall be but we'll
[1:21:16] see him as he isall hallelujah amen so
[1:21:20] we're living in an hour you know brother
[1:21:23] brah you know y y we listen to the
[1:21:25] sermon uh well most of it the Mighty God
[1:21:28] unvailable for us on
[1:21:29] Wednesday and and he begins to speak in
[1:21:32] that uh you know in the beginning and he
[1:21:34] says usually God has something to do has
[1:21:37] to do something so unusual to get the
[1:21:39] people back to the Bible again I can
[1:21:42] imagine that Noah was a kind of a nut to
[1:21:45] that scientific age he lived in because
[1:21:47] they could prove there was no water in
[1:21:48] the skies but God said there'd be some
[1:21:51] there so Noah preaching and believing
[1:21:53] that he became a nut
[1:21:55] and I'd imagine when Moses went down in
[1:21:57] Egypt he was a kind of a nut to Pharaoh
[1:21:59] but remember Pharaoh was a nut to him
[1:22:02] too amen we realize that even Jesus was
[1:22:05] considered a heretic that's right Martin
[1:22:07] Luther was a nut to the Catholic Church
[1:22:09] John Wesley was a nut to the Anglican so
[1:22:11] you know it's about time for another nut
[1:22:14] don't you think so but before there
[1:22:16] could be a nut there's got to be a bolt
[1:22:18] first to thread to it so you know Noah
[1:22:21] being a nut it takes the nut it pulls
[1:22:23] the bolt pulls something together and
[1:22:25] hold something together so Noah was able
[1:22:27] to pull all out that would believe into
[1:22:30] the ark out of the judgments by being a
[1:22:32] nut and we find out Moses pulled the
[1:22:35] church out of Egypt by being a nut
[1:22:38] that's right I think we need a nut now
[1:22:40] to pull the bride out of the church amen
[1:22:42] we need something now another one so we
[1:22:45] are a very odd sort of people and I
[1:22:47] thought tonight if the Lord willing I
[1:22:50] would try to read some scriptures
[1:22:52] pertaining to this and I want to speak
[1:22:54] to you just a few moments to try and
[1:22:56] show you why we're such an odd people so
[1:22:59] he's saying so he's speaking of now we
[1:23:01] need a nut we need a Ministry to come to
[1:23:03] pull the bride out of the church right
[1:23:06] and then he's going to say I'm going to
[1:23:07] read some scriptures pertaining to this
[1:23:10] amen he's not just remember when when
[1:23:13] the prophet speaks like Jesus when he
[1:23:15] when you know when he was speaking The
[1:23:17] Parables he spoke them in a certain
[1:23:19] order there's a reason he spoke what he
[1:23:22] spoke where he spoke okay he's not just
[1:23:24] saying things at random it's the same
[1:23:26] thing with the ministry of brother
[1:23:28] brandham when he's preaching a message
[1:23:29] it's not just something to excite people
[1:23:31] but he's declaring something amen and so
[1:23:34] he's saying now I'm going to show you
[1:23:35] the the scriptures that pertain to the
[1:23:38] nut that's going to pull the church out
[1:23:40] the bride out of the church rather amen
[1:23:43] and now notice let's just go to let's
[1:23:44] just go to them shall we let's go to 2
[1:23:46] Corinthians chapter um Second
[1:23:48] Corinthians 3 I just want to read these
[1:23:50] because you know it's so amazing you
[1:23:53] think of you think of the woman at the
[1:23:55] well oh Hallelujah and she's she's
[1:23:58] living her
[1:23:59] life she's had five husbands the ones
[1:24:02] with she's not married to and she thinks
[1:24:04] this is me I'm a Samaritan we have no
[1:24:07] dealings with the Jews I know about
[1:24:09] Jacob's Well I'm here at Jacob's well
[1:24:11] and you know our fathers your fathers
[1:24:13] say we should Worship in Jerusalem and
[1:24:15] whatever you know she has all these kind
[1:24:16] of ideas but that's not why she's there
[1:24:20] that's not her purpose amen but now the
[1:24:23] Lord Jesus amen he she was the first
[1:24:26] building stones in the bride of Christ
[1:24:29] amen she was the beginning of the
[1:24:30] restoration of the Of You' say or or the
[1:24:33] building of the second Eve you following
[1:24:36] me and she's living this life and this
[1:24:37] is how I am and I guess I've just got to
[1:24:40] you know endure this you know and being
[1:24:41] an outcast in my Village and no no no
[1:24:45] that wasn't her purpose in life amen but
[1:24:48] her purpose is that she would become one
[1:24:50] she was part of the Lord the bride is
[1:24:53] part of the bridegroom
[1:24:54] as Eve was part of Adam amen Eve Eve
[1:24:58] didn't come out of the earth you know
[1:25:00] separately to Adam Eve was the only
[1:25:02] female that came out of the male in the
[1:25:04] creation where God was showing that the
[1:25:07] the bride of Christ came out of him
[1:25:10] hallelujah amen that's why the Apostle
[1:25:12] Paul would pick up where where Levi paid
[1:25:15] ties and Abraham am mean so what Abraham
[1:25:17] did was attributed to Levi am mean so
[1:25:20] when the Lord died on Calvary to redeem
[1:25:22] you because you were in him it's
[1:25:23] attributed to you amen hallelujah that's
[1:25:26] why the sacrifice becomes effective the
[1:25:28] blood becomes effective amen cuz you
[1:25:30] were in him when he went to Calvary
[1:25:32] Hallelujah that's whyu amen I trust the
[1:25:35] word I trust this is not a this is a
[1:25:37] reality to you he washed all my sins
[1:25:40] away he's redeemed me Hallelujah I'm a
[1:25:43] child of the king amen he's washed me
[1:25:45] white as snow the devil has no account
[1:25:47] against me no more my book of life has
[1:25:49] been washed clean my life is in the
[1:25:51] Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah it's not
[1:25:53] my works anymore it's his Works in me
[1:25:57] hallelujah amen but because Levi was in
[1:25:59] Abraham and the Apostle Paul says not
[1:26:01] figuratively but Levi was literally in
[1:26:04] the loins of Abraham when he pay tized
[1:26:06] the mesc and it was attributed to it was
[1:26:09] attributed to Levi
[1:26:11] Hallelujah glory to God Amen so you know
[1:26:15] we have to come to a
[1:26:17] realization we are bone of his bone
[1:26:19] flesh of his flesh life of his life and
[1:26:22] it's not your Humanity
[1:26:25] we wrestle with the guy in the
[1:26:27] mirror too much we needed just to come
[1:26:30] to realization Lord you've made me a
[1:26:33] certain way with our Perfections and
[1:26:35] Imperfections you read through the
[1:26:37] scripture take the lineage of Jesus
[1:26:39] Christ in Matthew 1 there's
[1:26:41] Tamer that's not a that's not a that's
[1:26:44] that's like a
[1:26:45] scandal amen you know Tamer dressed up
[1:26:50] as a harlot sleeps with the
[1:26:53] father-in-law to to bring to bring forth
[1:26:55] Judah that's part of the lineage Rahab
[1:26:58] married Salon the lineage continues down
[1:27:01] it's not a it's not a perfect picture
[1:27:04] that we would think of but God ordained
[1:27:06] him that he would even though we know
[1:27:08] that physically he had nothing to do
[1:27:10] with you know the natural line coming
[1:27:12] forth his body was created in the womb
[1:27:14] of Mary but God said I'm going to
[1:27:16] attribute my seed coming through these
[1:27:18] people you following me so so what he's
[1:27:21] saying is I'll take the broken
[1:27:24] Hallelujah I'll take the wounded I'll
[1:27:26] take the hurting I'll take the you know
[1:27:28] the ones in pain those are the ones I
[1:27:31] used to bring forth my Glory Hallelujah
[1:27:33] not the perfect ones not the ones who
[1:27:35] have it all together not the ones who
[1:27:36] have got it worked out those aren't the
[1:27:38] ones I use I use the broken I use the
[1:27:40] the the hurting the pain the the the you
[1:27:43] know the bad history whatever it may be
[1:27:45] God uses
[1:27:46] them amen David's record wasn't all that
[1:27:49] good you think he takes bash Sheba
[1:27:52] Hallelujah he takes asba kills Uriah
[1:27:56] tries to cover it up and yet through
[1:27:58] that woman Solomon would
[1:28:00] come think about it hallelujah
[1:28:02] hallelujah he had a lot of sons amen he
[1:28:05] had probably maybe better Sons naturally
[1:28:08] that would have had better you know you
[1:28:10] know no black name to begin with no
[1:28:13] scandal in their family history like
[1:28:15] that but he to but he used basba to
[1:28:17] bring forth Solomon wow
[1:28:21] Hallelujah we'll get into that soon
[1:28:23] Glory
[1:28:24] oh I'm just going to read no actually
[1:28:27] yeah yeah we we're going to go there but
[1:28:29] but I want to go here first so we're
[1:28:31] going to jump this is why I don't really
[1:28:33] use PowerPoint I mean um what do you
[1:28:36] call
[1:28:37] it uh yes um
[1:28:41] iPad I have it here sorry because I'm on
[1:28:44] this line so I want to
[1:28:48] go Hallelujah you know I'm glad at least
[1:28:52] I get to print stuff
[1:28:57] out anyway here we go let's go to Second
[1:28:59] Corinthians 5 before we go to
[1:29:01] 3 now there's a reason God does this
[1:29:04] because he wants us to look Beyond the
[1:29:06] Veil of
[1:29:07] humanity right he doesn't want us to be
[1:29:09] caught up in our carnal nature and
[1:29:12] that's not just ourselves but each other
[1:29:14] amen amen but God uses the broken that's
[1:29:17] why we but we wrestle with ourselves so
[1:29:19] much but God through the scripture
[1:29:21] remember Ruth was a type of Youth
[1:29:24] Ruth was a moabitas enemy of Israel had
[1:29:27] no part of the Covenant of God she was a
[1:29:30] widow but yet God attributed his son
[1:29:32] coming through Ruth Rahab was a harlot
[1:29:36] Tamar did her things Hallelujah there's
[1:29:39] all Scandal and and and terrible
[1:29:43] history but that is the
[1:29:45] shadow right now I'm not condoning sin
[1:29:48] you all understand me am right but
[1:29:50] sometimes we look at our past and we
[1:29:52] wrestle because we disappoint ourselves
[1:29:55] and the more we walk with God the worse
[1:29:57] we see our past was amen because you're
[1:30:00] lifted higher above those things so so
[1:30:03] we we wrestle with our past but if
[1:30:06] they're the Shadow and they came out of
[1:30:08] such chaos and God was not ashamed to
[1:30:11] put them in the in the lineage of Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ there were many women who who who
[1:30:17] would have been more suited to marry
[1:30:19] Salon to you know you know to to
[1:30:22] continue the line of Judah more
[1:30:26] woman but why did he choose Rahab
[1:30:29] Hallelujah because God is showing this
[1:30:31] is the person I use there are a lot of
[1:30:34] women in Israel who would have would
[1:30:36] have wanted to marry Boaz that would
[1:30:38] have been more
[1:30:39] suited why did he take why did he take a
[1:30:42] gentile because God is showing the
[1:30:44] shadow of
[1:30:46] you right if that's the shadow this is
[1:30:49] what we have to come to terms with the
[1:30:52] shadow is showing a real
[1:30:54] ity so for example I can't really do it
[1:30:57] but if I had a shadow of my hand right
[1:31:01] and as I bring the as I bring you know
[1:31:03] my hand closer that you actually begin
[1:31:04] to see my hand you're not going to see a
[1:31:07] flipper of a dolphin if you look at a
[1:31:10] shadow of a hand it will be a hand
[1:31:12] because the hand because what's making
[1:31:15] the shadow is not going to be something
[1:31:16] different it's going to be the same
[1:31:18] thing right so what you see is the
[1:31:20] shadow in the Old Testament will become
[1:31:22] the reality in the new amen amen that's
[1:31:25] why you know if he used those kind of
[1:31:27] people there he uses them in the new cuz
[1:31:30] the shadow is pointing the new
[1:31:33] hallelujah amen now where are we second
[1:31:35] Corinthians 5 and and and
[1:31:40] 15 and that he died for all that they
[1:31:44] which uh live should not henceforth live
[1:31:47] unto themselves but unto him which died
[1:31:49] for them and rose again wherefore
[1:31:52] because of this henceforth know we no
[1:31:55] man after the flesh ye though we have
[1:31:58] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[1:32:01] henceforth we know him no more because
[1:32:04] we know we know the Lord by his
[1:32:06] manifested word that's how we know him
[1:32:08] when his word becomes manifested that's
[1:32:10] Jesus Christ amen right but he's saying
[1:32:13] but but we henceforth know we know man
[1:32:17] after the flesh so we should not know
[1:32:20] each other after our personality after
[1:32:23] our culture after anything that is
[1:32:26] pertaining to this amen we are not I now
[1:32:30] I pray it's this way I trust we are not
[1:32:33] in this church because we get
[1:32:35] along because our personalities just gel
[1:32:37] and everyone just gets along so well you
[1:32:40] know that's not I trust that's not why
[1:32:41] you're here because that's knowing
[1:32:44] people after the flesh that's actually
[1:32:46] just being kindly minded amen but we're
[1:32:48] called to henceforth know no man after
[1:32:50] the flesh am mean so when we see each
[1:32:52] other I should say I see I see the word
[1:32:55] I see the word and just pretend I point
[1:32:56] it to you all just so no one gets
[1:32:57] offended I me but but I see the word
[1:32:59] made flesh I see Jesus Christ in flesh
[1:33:02] again that's why we have Fellowship
[1:33:04] that's why we have Oneness around him
[1:33:07] because we're part of him doesn't matter
[1:33:09] what age you can be young you can be old
[1:33:10] you can be in the middle
[1:33:12] somewhere with with a few more years
[1:33:15] experience being 18 but you know as long
[1:33:18] as you can look beyond the human Veil
[1:33:21] and say I see the word I see de has been
[1:33:24] made flesh in this person I see that
[1:33:26] they are part of the Bride Hallelujah
[1:33:29] that's why the Apostle Paul in First
[1:33:31] Corinthians 11 says that you know around
[1:33:33] the Lord's table that's why many are
[1:33:35] sickly and weak and many sleep not
[1:33:37] Discerning the Lord's body that's right
[1:33:40] cuz they're not Discerning actually that
[1:33:42] is the word made flesh that person is
[1:33:44] the word made flesh this person's the
[1:33:46] word right they get caught up in this
[1:33:48] thing this thing will always disappoint
[1:33:51] that's right brother right because we
[1:33:53] have a sticky nature amen and we meant
[1:33:56] iron needs to sharpen iron Hallelujah
[1:33:59] and the thing is God is tailor made do
[1:34:01] you believe your walk is pre-ordained
[1:34:04] amen so God God sees your nature now in
[1:34:08] eternity he has a picture of you at your
[1:34:10] best in his family album right and he's
[1:34:13] determined you become that image he's
[1:34:16] determined right at your best not at the
[1:34:18] peak of your natural best but at his
[1:34:20] best so now he says I've ordained this
[1:34:23] person they will look like this my word
[1:34:26] when they get to the other side so now
[1:34:28] when he's plann this all he's singing
[1:34:29] now I know I've got to get them there
[1:34:32] and I've got to use their free will that
[1:34:35] they will actually give their will over
[1:34:37] to me that I can mold them shape them
[1:34:39] into that image and then so what happens
[1:34:42] he says well and I know in
[1:34:43] 2019 whoever place your name here will
[1:34:47] be in this place amen but he also knows
[1:34:49] now now I need iron to sharpen
[1:34:52] iron so now need this person to be here
[1:34:54] too cuz they are cuz they need to rub
[1:34:57] they need to Wi scrape and rub and
[1:34:59] because they have to look like this
[1:35:02] Hallelujah than God you're God I won't
[1:35:05] say he's an opportunist but he uses
[1:35:06] every
[1:35:07] opportunity hallelujah
[1:35:10] amen that's why we should henceforth
[1:35:12] know no man after the flesh glory to God
[1:35:16] Amen Hallelujah I want to look like him
[1:35:19] don't you amen you know especially with
[1:35:22] children you have children and I don't
[1:35:24] know who said it but it's so true uh
[1:35:26] they are God's Little agents in your
[1:35:28] life amen they are they are God's agents
[1:35:32] and they work
[1:35:33] full-time sometimes they never sleep
[1:35:35] they work overtime and you wish they'd
[1:35:37] take leave but hey you know but God
[1:35:40] knows what you have need of that's right
[1:35:42] amen and that's why we shouldn't get
[1:35:44] frustrated in life because if we're
[1:35:47] frustrated we're not looking at what as
[1:35:50] what God's doing cuz if we really can
[1:35:52] see what God is doing doing then the
[1:35:54] frustration should go cuzz you see God's
[1:35:56] purpose in every trial that's why
[1:35:58] whenever a trial hits could be big or
[1:36:00] little say Lord what do you wanting to
[1:36:01] teach me amen you cuz he's got something
[1:36:05] he doesn't just oh I'm just going to
[1:36:06] mess up their life and do the you know
[1:36:08] I'm going to cause some trouble just for
[1:36:09] them to pull their hair out and no
[1:36:11] there's a purpose if we can see the
[1:36:14] purpose then we can with faith faith
[1:36:17] worketh patience right so if we really
[1:36:19] believe him then we'll have patience in
[1:36:20] the trial Lord hallelujah all is well
[1:36:25] Hallelujah I've heard the message Shalom
[1:36:26] all is well amen so you know our Lord is
[1:36:30] a very good
[1:36:31] teacher Hallelujah and I want to be
[1:36:35] taught and you know a disciple is one
[1:36:38] who is actually a
[1:36:39] pupil right but a true disciple is is is
[1:36:43] taught by actually doing it's practical
[1:36:46] it's not just Theory right the Apostle
[1:36:49] Paul had a lot of theory but then he met
[1:36:51] the real teacher he met the Lord on the
[1:36:53] road to Damascus and then went through
[1:36:55] all practical things he went through
[1:36:57] child training he went through hardship
[1:36:58] and distress and things he would never
[1:37:00] have probably imagined before he met the
[1:37:03] Lord and the Lord takes us through
[1:37:05] things it's like what's a trial
[1:37:07] practical
[1:37:08] learning Hallelujah practical learning
[1:37:11] we're going to practically apply this to
[1:37:13] your life now and sometimes you know
[1:37:15] it's easier just to sit at a desk and
[1:37:16] write notes but our God isn't that way
[1:37:19] he's a practical teacher Hallelujah so
[1:37:23] thank you Lord glory amen I'm
[1:37:27] glad okay now let's go back to Second uh
[1:37:30] Corinthians
[1:37:32] 3 I mean I just wanted to drop that in
[1:37:34] because that's where we were second
[1:37:36] Corinthians 3 says I saying that brother
[1:37:37] Braham is saying that I want
[1:37:39] to um so we need a nut to pull the bride
[1:37:43] out of the church and I'd like to read
[1:37:45] some scriptures pertaining to this so he
[1:37:48] goes to 2 Corinthians 3 and and we'll
[1:37:50] read we'll just read down from verse 7
[1:37:54] am I in the right place yes here we are
[1:37:56] 2 Corinthians
[1:37:57] 3:7 pardon me but if the ministration of
[1:38:01] death written and engraven in Stones was
[1:38:04] glorious so that the children of Israel
[1:38:06] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[1:38:08] Moses from the glory of his countenance
[1:38:11] which Glory was uh to be done away how
[1:38:15] shall not the ministration of the spirit
[1:38:17] be rather glorious for if the
[1:38:19] ministration of condemnation be glory
[1:38:22] much more do the ministration of
[1:38:23] righteousness exceeding glory for even
[1:38:26] that which was made glorious have no
[1:38:29] more glory in this Respect by reason of
[1:38:32] the glory that excelth for if that which
[1:38:35] is done away was glorious much more that
[1:38:38] which remaineth is glorious seeing then
[1:38:40] that we have such hope we use plainness
[1:38:44] of speech and not as Moses which put a
[1:38:46] veil over his face that the children of
[1:38:49] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[1:38:51] end of that which is abolished
[1:38:54] but their minds were blinded for until
[1:38:56] this day remaineth the same Veil untaken
[1:38:58] away in the reading of the Old Testament
[1:39:00] which Veil is done away in Christ but
[1:39:03] even unto this day when Moses read the
[1:39:05] veil is upon their heart nevertheless
[1:39:07] when it shall be turned to the Lord the
[1:39:10] veil shall be taken away now the Lord is
[1:39:13] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[1:39:15] Lord is uh there is Liberty but we all
[1:39:18] with open face which means unveiled face
[1:39:20] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:39:22] Lord I changed transformed into the same
[1:39:25] image from glory to glory even as by the
[1:39:29] spirit of the
[1:39:31] Lord and then let's go to um he reads
[1:39:33] another place in in Philippians 2 and 1
[1:39:36] and I just want to read these I'm not
[1:39:37] going to go in great depth into them but
[1:39:39] I just want to give a quick
[1:39:43] um a quick uh thought of this here
[1:39:45] before we wrap up so it says in
[1:39:48] Philippians 2 and
[1:39:51] 1 if there be therefore any cons ation
[1:39:53] in Christ any comfort of love if any
[1:39:55] Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and
[1:39:57] mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[1:40:00] likeminded having the same love being of
[1:40:03] one Accord of one mind let nothing be
[1:40:06] done through Strife or vain Glory but in
[1:40:07] loness of Mind Let each esteem other
[1:40:11] better than themselves look not every
[1:40:13] man on his own things but every man also
[1:40:16] on the things of others let this mind be
[1:40:18] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:40:21] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:40:23] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:40:25] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:40:27] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:40:30] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:40:32] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:40:34] humbled himself and being became
[1:40:36] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:40:39] the Cross now so brother Braham is
[1:40:41] reading these scriptures and he's saying
[1:40:43] that these pertain to the bride being
[1:40:45] pulled out of the church Hallelujah now
[1:40:48] so he's saying so we read here in in in
[1:40:51] Philippians 2 that when says that he was
[1:40:54] made in the
[1:40:55] form uh being in the
[1:40:58] um that that who was in the form of God
[1:41:00] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:41:02] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:41:04] but took upon himself the form of a
[1:41:06] servant now that word form in the Greek
[1:41:09] means a morphe which is the physical
[1:41:11] appearance of something and brother
[1:41:13] Brown speaks about it's like an actor in
[1:41:15] a play can take multiple roles they can
[1:41:18] they can play the part of the villain go
[1:41:20] out get changed play the part of someone
[1:41:22] else go out get changed be a different
[1:41:24] one and it's the same thing with our
[1:41:25] lord Jesus down Through the Ages he's
[1:41:27] taken on different forms amen he was in
[1:41:30] the pillar of fire same God he came as
[1:41:33] mesc to to Abraham without father or
[1:41:36] mother descent to your beginning Days
[1:41:38] end of life mesc was not a man he was
[1:41:41] God in a different form amen he was in
[1:41:44] the burning bush to Moses right he was
[1:41:46] the pillar of cloud By Night by by night
[1:41:49] and the cloud by day same God Amen is
[1:41:52] the captain of the Lord's host to Joshua
[1:41:54] same God different form I mean he came
[1:41:56] to Moos um Abraham in Genesis 18 as a
[1:41:59] man and had a meal same God different
[1:42:01] form right he appeared like an old man
[1:42:03] to gide him with a staff same God
[1:42:05] different form amen the same God all the
[1:42:08] way down through hallelujah amen Ezekiel
[1:42:11] saw him as the wheel within the wheel
[1:42:13] same God different form all the way down
[1:42:16] through and then he became flesh so he
[1:42:19] changed his form going from invisible to
[1:42:22] visible
[1:42:24] Hallelujah so he did this and then he
[1:42:27] changed his form again where he went
[1:42:29] from one man into a multimember body
[1:42:32] Hallelujah and then he appeared to Paul
[1:42:34] on the road to Damascus as Pillar of
[1:42:35] Fire again same God different form Paul
[1:42:38] said who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you
[1:42:40] persecute and the Apostle Paul is
[1:42:42] persecuting men and women filled with
[1:42:44] that Pillar of Fire amen so God changing
[1:42:48] his form and this is done to call out a
[1:42:51] bride Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's
[1:42:54] why we live in the end time where the
[1:42:56] mighty Angel has descended Revelations
[1:42:58] 10 with an open book so God put on for
[1:43:01] me he hid himself behind a prophet Veil
[1:43:04] to manifest the promised word for the
[1:43:06] age just like Moses god came down and
[1:43:08] Moses spoke the word right those people
[1:43:10] who received that word took their
[1:43:12] inheritance amen they weren't in the
[1:43:14] wilderness anymore they weren't by
[1:43:15] Jordan they went and took their Mountain
[1:43:16] like Caleb I mean cuz they received they
[1:43:19] didn't they weren't they didn't know
[1:43:20] Moses after the flesh like Corin day and
[1:43:23] different ones they knew him by the
[1:43:25] revelation of who Moses was in God I
[1:43:29] mean he was the prophet of the age to
[1:43:30] bring the word that they would manifest
[1:43:32] the pro promise of that age which was
[1:43:33] dwelling in the promised land Hallelujah
[1:43:36] are you following me am mean it's the
[1:43:37] same thing in this age brother brah says
[1:43:39] that the seventh angels on earth when
[1:43:41] they Revelations 101 that Mighty Angel
[1:43:43] descends amen so now God comes to his
[1:43:45] Prophet manifests his word to the people
[1:43:48] which is the truth of this scripture I
[1:43:50] mean that a people would come to their
[1:43:52] position in Christ in their fullness I
[1:43:54] mean that everything that the church was
[1:43:56] before the Ephesian age fell or began I
[1:44:00] mean we would be restored to that same
[1:44:02] book of Acts Church am mean that there's
[1:44:03] a people not just talking about the
[1:44:05] cross but the power of the Cross is
[1:44:07] manifested in their lives that the word
[1:44:09] puts on flesh once again I mean we don't
[1:44:12] just talk about healing we see healing
[1:44:14] we don't just talk about deliverance we
[1:44:15] see deliverance we don't just talk about
[1:44:17] the Holy Ghost we see him in his power I
[1:44:20] mean we see him in his mighty acts why
[1:44:22] cuz the end time message releases the
[1:44:24] Holy Ghost upon the
[1:44:26] people hallelujah so God changing his
[1:44:29] form right is now part of God pulling
[1:44:32] out a bride a nut Hallelujah that
[1:44:36] threads the bride onto the bolt the word
[1:44:38] that they become
[1:44:39] one
[1:44:41] amen and then and then we read in 2
[1:44:45] Corinthians
[1:44:46] 3 where he says that when the veil is
[1:44:49] taken away speaking of the Jews when
[1:44:51] they read the Old Testament
[1:44:53] that their hearts AV
[1:44:55] veiled that that when they read it they
[1:44:58] cannot see what it says that's why the
[1:45:01] scribes and Pharisees the herodians they
[1:45:03] said we're moses' disciples we know who
[1:45:06] Moses was they couldn't see the one who
[1:45:08] Moses had would come they couldn't see
[1:45:10] the one that the prophet said would come
[1:45:13] and he he the Lord manifested all the
[1:45:16] scripture that was pertaining to his
[1:45:17] ministry but they couldn't see it
[1:45:20] because their hearts were veiled right
[1:45:23] but when the veil was taken away then
[1:45:25] the people really saw him who he
[1:45:28] was amen so now it's the same thing even
[1:45:31] in this day that it's when the veil is
[1:45:34] taken away that people's spiritual eyes
[1:45:37] come open amen that's when we can really
[1:45:41] see him for who he is not hunting
[1:45:45] stories not just
[1:45:47] testimonies amen but you see him in his
[1:45:49] word all those things sure are good and
[1:45:52] fine but you've got to see him in this
[1:45:54] day in his word amen that that that when
[1:45:57] you read the scripture when you hear the
[1:45:59] message it's not just information it's
[1:46:01] not just maybe a nice sermon but is God
[1:46:03] revealing himself to you in order to
[1:46:06] transform you into His
[1:46:08] Image amen as it says if the veil is
[1:46:11] taken away amen now where the spirit of
[1:46:14] the Lord is where the spirit of the Lord
[1:46:15] is there is liberty and that means with
[1:46:17] there's liberty it means they're no
[1:46:18] longer slaves but now we're Sons so
[1:46:20] we're no longer under the bondage of
[1:46:22] religion or bondage of sin or bondage of
[1:46:24] the devil amen but now there's liberty
[1:46:26] now we've come from slavery and now we
[1:46:28] are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah
[1:46:31] that's why it's so powerful I mean the
[1:46:33] devil doesn't want us to know who we are
[1:46:35] he doesn't want us to come to our
[1:46:37] position but it's time just to kick the
[1:46:39] devil off our Mountain amen If he if
[1:46:41] he's afflicting you just tell him to get
[1:46:43] out amen by the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:46:46] has to listen to your voice not someone
[1:46:49] else's voice your voice you've got to
[1:46:51] stand there and say Satan get out out of
[1:46:53] my life I'm sick of you we're through am
[1:46:55] mean your divorc we're done away
[1:46:58] Hallelujah you have to say it you can't
[1:47:00] just say oh help me help me no God
[1:47:03] called you to speak his word Moses was
[1:47:06] there at the Red Sea and God said to him
[1:47:08] why you crying why are you crying unto
[1:47:11] me Pharaoh was coming the Red Sea was
[1:47:14] there God LED them to that place you go
[1:47:17] read it they didn't just run and where
[1:47:19] are we going to go let's go this way
[1:47:20] let's go this way now God said go here
[1:47:22] go here you'll end here and then now
[1:47:25] Moses is panicking because the people
[1:47:27] because he's under the influence of the
[1:47:28] people because the people are all
[1:47:30] stressed God Called Moses God had
[1:47:33] commissioned Moses so the people's
[1:47:35] opinion shouldn't have mattered to Moses
[1:47:38] are you following me amen if you are
[1:47:40] called by God if you have been
[1:47:42] commissioned by his holy spirit amen if
[1:47:45] you have who's made him if you have met
[1:47:48] him you've been commissioned amen so you
[1:47:50] shouldn't be leaning on the arms of man
[1:47:52] and man's ideas and what's going on in a
[1:47:54] trial that's why when the enemy comes in
[1:47:57] like a flood don't lean on this guy
[1:48:00] don't lean on someone's opinion you talk
[1:48:02] to God about it amen cuz when any comes
[1:48:06] like in a flood he says I'll raise up a
[1:48:08] standard and you'll find out you're
[1:48:10] actually that anointed standard
[1:48:12] hallelujah hallelujah but he was getting
[1:48:14] all tossed because the people were
[1:48:16] saying have you brought us out here to
[1:48:17] die let's go you and he got a word and
[1:48:20] God and he says God what am I going to
[1:48:21] do I imagine he wasn't just Cal about it
[1:48:23] he really cried out and God just says
[1:48:26] why are you
[1:48:27] crying why are you crying speak move
[1:48:31] forward yes just speak and move forward
[1:48:34] speak to the situation I know the
[1:48:36] Christian world has perverted that but
[1:48:38] there's still a truth in it just speak
[1:48:41] to it and move
[1:48:42] forward I mean you know God you know
[1:48:44] sometimes we think he's just going to be
[1:48:45] it's all right and you come on you being
[1:48:49] equipped take that rod you mean the
[1:48:53] shepherd stuff you know Moses comes to
[1:48:55] the burning bush he's carry I don't know
[1:48:57] how long he's been carrying this rod for
[1:48:59] it was the rod of God's
[1:49:01] Deliverance Hallelujah there was you
[1:49:03] could say Atomic it was an atomic bomb
[1:49:06] he was fully primed and ready to go but
[1:49:08] God had to take the safety off it that's
[1:49:10] right he had to see what his weapon
[1:49:11] could do Hallelujah and then so he's
[1:49:15] carrying this stick and has done many
[1:49:17] things he's still carrying the same
[1:49:19] stick and he's crying unto God that's
[1:49:22] why my God why are you crying hallu what
[1:49:25] do you got in your hand you understand
[1:49:28] what I'm
[1:49:29] saying the shepherd stick without the
[1:49:33] anointing was just a bit of wood but
[1:49:36] when it was anointed Hall then it was he
[1:49:38] was Unstoppable and it's the same thing
[1:49:41] with this word when this word just ink
[1:49:44] on
[1:49:45] paper doesn't do anything but if it's
[1:49:48] anointed by the spirit of God in your
[1:49:50] life Amen brother B says when it's
[1:49:52] Spirit-filled man takes the word of God
[1:49:56] speaks it across their lips it is the
[1:49:58] same as deity speaking Every Mountain
[1:50:02] has to go nothing can stand before that
[1:50:05] man or say or that woman Hallelujah you
[1:50:08] say well that's all very glorious that's
[1:50:10] you that's

[1:51:19] name on it hallelujah amen and we should
[1:51:21] be the same like little kids can I have
[1:51:23] it now I want it now I want to know I
[1:51:24] want to know when's it going to be

[1:51:52] the same thing
[1:51:54] Hallelujah speak and move
[1:51:57] forward
[1:51:59] Hallelujah I might just leave it there
[1:52:01] but I want you to think about it why do
[1:52:04] we
[1:52:04] cry God just said you know it's like
[1:52:06] even even Moses he brings all his
[1:52:09] complaints to God at the burning bush
[1:52:11] God doesn't sympathize he just got mad
[1:52:14] you read the account he was actually
[1:52:16] angry at Moses oh I can't speak well who
[1:52:19] made man to speak I can't do this who
[1:52:21] made man to do this yeah why is it
[1:52:23] because we think this thing can't do it
[1:52:27] now this thing can't do
[1:52:29] it we have to come to that realization
[1:52:32] this man cannot bring forth the promise
[1:52:34] of God one bit okay even in our good
[1:52:39] attentions it takes God in you to do it
[1:52:42] amen but but the thing is you've got to
[1:52:43] have confidence if God has called you I
[1:52:46] mean that he will do it he doesn't just
[1:52:48] say now now become the bride of Christ
[1:52:50] and we're like well okay what are we
[1:52:52] going to do it says in the Book of
[1:52:55] Revelation that that the bride has made
[1:52:59] herself ready it was granted to her that
[1:53:02] she' be a raay in fine linen clean and
[1:53:04] white which is the righteous of saints
[1:53:06] so he's got the wedding garments and he
[1:53:08] calls you then you just got to put on
[1:53:10] the Garment cuz the garment's cut to fit
[1:53:12] you the word has been cut to fit you
[1:53:14] Hallelujah you just got to put it on
[1:53:17] it's not oh how am I going to obtain to
[1:53:18] this no Walk This Way here's the
[1:53:21] showroom or here's the what you know
[1:53:23] it's there where's my one there's your
[1:53:25] one there Hallelujah wonderful you
[1:53:28] following me you know we're not just
[1:53:29] we're not just stabbing the dark
[1:53:32] people amen God's called we just have to
[1:53:37] respond and then he enables you to do
[1:53:40] what you need to do but he does it we're
[1:53:43] not called to produce um ishmail and
[1:53:46] whatever no that was human
[1:53:49] instrumentality that was human doing but
[1:53:51] when God came it was was perfect amen
[1:53:53] and it's the same thing with us amen
[1:53:56] we're not called to lean on the arm of
[1:53:58] Flesh God will do it but you got to have
[1:54:01] confidence he'll do
[1:54:02] it amen let's just leave it there but
[1:54:05] we're changed no wait I want to read
[1:54:06] that a bit more but see the veil's been
[1:54:08] taken out of the way no no this is this
[1:54:10] is so vital because we take we can take
[1:54:12] the message and just oh it's just a
[1:54:14] bunch of sermons that's Jesus Christ
[1:54:17] revealing himself in the scripture as
[1:54:19] Jesus Christ revealed in the scripture
[1:54:21] he says when that Veil is taken out of
[1:54:22] the way what's that Veil taken out of
[1:54:24] the way oh I'm actually a son or
[1:54:26] daughter of God that's a start of it you
[1:54:29] begin to realize I'm not from this place
[1:54:31] maybe I was born in this part of the
[1:54:33] Earth but this is not my
[1:54:34] identity amen I am a Christian before
[1:54:37] I'm in New Zealander even though I love
[1:54:39] this country but I'm a Christian first I
[1:54:42] trust you all the same way my identity
[1:54:44] is not in my
[1:54:47] flag right my identity is in the
[1:54:50] word hallelujah that's what it's got to
[1:54:53] be sure we can be proud of where we're
[1:54:55] from whatever but that's not that's not
[1:54:57] the real thing I am not a New Zealander
[1:55:00] first I'm a
[1:55:01] Christian Hallelujah and if that is your
[1:55:04] you know if that is your heart I'm a
[1:55:06] believer I'm a Christian then it doesn't
[1:55:08] matter what nationality people are from
[1:55:10] you'll have a heart for them doesn't
[1:55:12] matter what culture because Jesus died
[1:55:14] for
[1:55:15] all and it won't be all national
[1:55:17] politics and fighting and this nation
[1:55:19] this nation the devil's got it all uh
[1:55:21] wrapped up that's right don't worry
[1:55:24] about it everything The Book of
[1:55:26] Revelation says that God put in the
[1:55:28] heart of those people that his word will
[1:55:30] be
[1:55:31] fulfilled God has allowed it he's not in
[1:55:34] shock he's not in panic mode at the
[1:55:37] world falling apart and nuclear war on
[1:55:39] its way he's not panicking he knows
[1:55:41] where his bride is he's busy with her
[1:55:44] and a predestinated time when the last
[1:55:46] name comes it's in the book as
[1:55:47] manifested comes in we're gone
[1:55:50] Hallelujah and a bomb can't drum before
[1:55:53] that
[1:55:53] happens amen it's not going to be like
[1:55:55] oh there's the Great Tribulation because
[1:55:57] God's program is running late and then
[1:55:58] the bride's called No the bride will be
[1:56:01] called
[1:56:02] before so he says now where that Spirit
[1:56:05] of the Lord is neveress when it shall
[1:56:07] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:56:10] away am mean when that heart is turned
[1:56:12] to the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:56:15] and then we all I'm just skipping verse
[1:56:17] 17 with open face that means unveiled
[1:56:20] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[1:56:23] of the Lord are changed into the same
[1:56:25] image from glory to glory even as by the
[1:56:28] spirit of the Lord so saying when the
[1:56:30] when the Lord unveils your heart but not
[1:56:33] only unveils you but he's unveiled I
[1:56:36] mean the Book of Revelation it means the
[1:56:38] unveiling so it's like a statue with a
[1:56:40] with a cloth over it and then finally
[1:56:42] the cloth comes off and you see what the
[1:56:44] statue is am mean for nearly 2,000 years
[1:56:47] people have seen Christ under a cloth
[1:56:51] cuz you can see you see a statue and you
[1:56:53] see it covered you think well I think
[1:56:55] it's this or I think he's doing this and
[1:56:56] you you have a general idea based on its
[1:56:58] shape people have probed at the Bible
[1:57:00] they've got a lot of Truth out of it but
[1:57:02] it took god with a prophet vessel to to
[1:57:04] take the veil off himself I mean that
[1:57:07] finally we see that's why the Bible's
[1:57:09] not a mystery The Book of Revelation is
[1:57:11] the bride's book amen we know where we
[1:57:14] are in it we know what the devil's doing
[1:57:15] we know what God's doing and we know
[1:57:17] what's happening cuz it's all made plain
[1:57:19] in the Book of Revelation when a symbol
[1:57:21] becomes plain it's no longer a symbol it
[1:57:23] becomes a
[1:57:24] reality right oh I think it's this now
[1:57:26] God says no it's that okay I know what
[1:57:28] it is that's real you know but the
[1:57:31] reason that is all done is that he would
[1:57:32] call us out the bride is called out of
[1:57:35] the church right amen so now when so he
[1:57:38] so brother Bram is saying is now when we
[1:57:40] when when the when that Veil is taken
[1:57:42] off the people's hearts which it has
[1:57:44] been I trust it's being done so again
[1:57:48] you know you this morning then we with
[1:57:50] an open face unveiled face beheld Behold
[1:57:53] Him The Living Word right and as we are
[1:57:58] we are changed or
[1:58:00] transformed into the same image into the
[1:58:02] image of his word we're made to be like
[1:58:04] Jesus amen amen and we're changed from
[1:58:07] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:58:10] the Lord so brother said and the Mighty
[1:58:13] God unveiled that this scripture
[1:58:15] pertains to the calling out of the Bride
[1:58:19] where God would come down take the veil
[1:58:21] off of our Hearts unveil himself that
[1:58:24] when we Behold Him in his word right we
[1:58:27] are changed or transformed from glory to
[1:58:30] glory
