[26:59] calvary lord
[27:01] lord if you only knew lord if these
[27:03] people could only see what you are doing
[27:05] in their midst father
[27:07] lord how you prepared a song leader to
[27:09] sing these songs lord with the message
[27:11] that's upon my heart lord
[27:13] when you went to the cross lord and you
[27:14] died for us father and every
[27:17] blood lord drop of blood dropped down it
[27:19] was for us
[27:20] for our sins every stripes was for our
[27:22] healing

[27:27] everything that we

[27:54] lord there are very present help lord is
[27:57] you
[27:57] lord and that's the only one we can turn
[27:59] to is our lord jesus christ lord because
[28:02] as brother andy said tonight we come
[28:04] under expectation lord
[28:06] not to hear from man lord not to just
[28:08] have some feebles of man or word of man
[28:11] or doctrines of man lord
[28:13] but to see the living god answer prayer
[28:16] confirm that he's still with us the
[28:17] great i am walk with his people father
[28:20] teach us help us correct us lord that's
[28:23] why we come to your house lord jesus
[28:25] so as a family we can pray together for
[28:27] those that's in need lord
[28:29] lord we don't come here for any other
[28:30] reason than you and if there is any
[28:32] other reason that people are here lord i
[28:34] pray
[28:35] that that would leave them now in the
[28:36] name of jesus christ may nothing stand
[28:38] between your word
[28:40] your kingdom and your holy spirit lord
[28:42] jesus lord because we
[28:44] need ministering to it is a very late
[28:46] hour lord
[28:48] it's a very late hour lord indeed lord
[28:52] eternity and this realm lord this time
[28:55] has merged lord and if we ever knew
[28:58] where we stand right now
[29:00] lord what a people we should be lord
[29:03] lord i pray that you help every one of
[29:05] us lord to receive
[29:06] what you want us to receive let us not
[29:08] get distracted
[29:09] and lord may you speak to each one of us
[29:12] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[29:14] pray
[29:15] amen amen
[29:18] amen god bless you saints
[29:22] it's wednesday night and we have a
[29:23] prayer meeting um
[29:26] i wanted to make it a circle but with a
[29:27] new cheese and that's so comfy we
[29:30] we couldn't do it but thank you anyway
[29:32] so now we can just preach extra long
[29:34] because you won't get tired
[29:36] i mean let's jump into the scriptures
[29:39] let's go to
[29:40] proverbs and we're going to go to
[29:42] proverbs 16.
[29:45] musicians thank you very much brother
[29:47] marion if you knew
[29:49] how accurate your songs were tonight
[29:52] praise the lord that he goes before the
[29:55] battle before the battle is even fought
[29:57] amen i just want to open up here
[30:01] so we're going to go just want to get to
[30:04] my summer
[30:08] 16 and we're going to start by verse 18.
[30:12] now as we read it i i encourage you if
[30:15] you ever have a bit of time
[30:17] and you ever want to want to get stuck
[30:19] into a book
[30:20] get stuck into the book of proverbs it
[30:23] is a wonderful book to read i think
[30:25] when uh king solomon wrote all these
[30:28] things he knew a couple of things they
[30:31] and when you see these these revelations
[30:34] it is more than just the words on print
[30:36] because while you read it search your
[30:38] heart
[30:39] see if you line up with some of these
[30:41] things that's there
[30:42] and then speak to god about it amen
[30:46] so let's start it verse 18 it says pride
[30:48] goeth before destruction
[30:51] and haughty spirit before the fall so
[30:54] means for anyone that doesn't know it's
[30:56] a pride spirit a
[30:57] uplifted spirit somebody that that
[30:59] exalts him above
[31:00] anyone else pretty much like satan did
[31:03] when he was still in heaven he exalted
[31:05] him he had a haughty heart he he wanted
[31:07] to be as the most high
[31:09] so that that heart that is the holy
[31:11] spirit before the fall
[31:14] better it is to be in humble spirit
[31:17] which is lowly
[31:18] then to divide the spoil with the proud
[31:21] how many times do we find ourselves
[31:24] mixing with the proud instead of
[31:26] standing away from the proud
[31:29] because it's nice if you if your team
[31:31] wins and we're all celebrating it's all
[31:32] good
[31:34] but a humble spirit would be thankful
[31:36] for anything that happens now i'm just
[31:38] like taking taking a normal let's say a
[31:40] rugby game or a
[31:41] soccer game or anything it's easy
[31:44] when everybody is all oh we want you one
[31:46] and in the next game oh we won we
[31:48] unbeatable and then that spirit quickly
[31:49] becomes something
[31:51] which is not actually going to add
[31:53] anything to your faith
[31:54] you're not going to get better because
[31:56] you thought you made it already
[31:58] so be careful of this spirit the spirit
[32:00] of proudness the spirit of exalting
[32:02] yourself of thinking
[32:03] even in the truth that you're something
[32:04] any other than anybody else
[32:07] keep humble stay on your knees it's so
[32:09] important it's not a part of the message
[32:11] but it is so important that all of us
[32:13] keep searching our hearts and saying
[32:15] lord
[32:15] am i actually in your love
[32:19] am i in that love that agape love that
[32:21] you have am i in there
[32:24] search your hearts me as well when i
[32:26] read this
[32:27] it brought a big rebuke on my life to
[32:29] say are you
[32:30] actively searching god's love and favor
[32:34] in humbleness
[32:37] the wise in heart shall be called
[32:40] prudent
[32:41] and the sweetness of thy lip increases
[32:43] learning
[32:45] understanding is a wellspring of life
[32:47] unto him that have it
[32:49] so understanding is a wellspring of life
[32:52] unto him that have it
[32:54] but the instruction of fools is folly
[32:57] how many times do we listen to other
[32:59] people instead of just
[33:01] reading our bibles
[33:04] the heart of the wise teaches his mouth
[33:07] an ad of learning to his lips pleasant
[33:10] words
[33:11] are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul
[33:15] and health to the bones a merry heart
[33:19] brother ben said tonight praying of joy
[33:23] there is a way that seemeth right unto a
[33:26] man
[33:27] and the end thereof is the ways of death
[33:30] as much as we reason as much as we
[33:33] justify
[33:34] as much as we think we're anything the
[33:36] way that seemeth right
[33:38] unto a man is the end thereof is the
[33:41] ways of death
[33:43] the bible says seek your salvation with
[33:45] fear and trembling
[33:46] and i think we should do that he that
[33:48] laboreth laboreth for himself
[33:51] for his mouth craveth it of him
[33:54] an ungodly man diggeth up evil
[33:57] and in his lips there is a burning
[34:01] fire amen may the lord bless this word
[34:04] you're on my seat and
[34:07] it's not a heavy sermon at all the
[34:09] reason why
[34:10] i read this is because we need to find a
[34:13] place where we get where god can start
[34:15] speaking to us
[34:16] you have to if you read your bible and
[34:19] you just read it as
[34:20] a couple of words on the page god's not
[34:22] speaking to you so sometimes correction
[34:24] is good
[34:25] and sometimes when god corrects you
[34:27] share it with others
[34:29] and that's what i'm doing tonight okay
[34:31] i'm gonna share a bit of
[34:32] of what the lord is doing not just in my
[34:34] life but
[34:35] how he's teaching me to be more like him
[34:39] amen amen
[34:45] so when we and i'm not going to be long
[34:47] tonight
[34:48] when we look at a life of a christian
[34:51] where do we find our example
[34:54] where's our example how should a
[34:56] christian live
[34:57] how do i overcome why do i keep failing
[35:00] and falling in the same traps
[35:02] why is the devil always against me when
[35:04] i try to do good
[35:05] there's all these wonderful questions
[35:07] that christians ask
[35:08] and there's no answers that can come
[35:10] from a man
[35:12] it has to come out of here
[35:16] it has to come out of here because when
[35:17] god speaks through his word
[35:19] and it gets confirmed then that is a
[35:21] finished work
[35:22] because it says my word will not return
[35:25] to me void
[35:26] so he says whatever you reach whatever
[35:28] starts knocking in your heart i am busy
[35:30] talking to you my child
[35:32] pay attention but how many times do we
[35:34] hear the words
[35:35] we see it we read it it comes over the
[35:37] pulpit and yet we're lazy to respond
[35:41] we're lazy to respond because god gives
[35:43] you
[35:44] warning and warning and warning
[35:47] and then he says now i have to correct
[35:49] you
[35:50] and because he's a gracious god he gives
[35:53] you the choice
[35:54] what your correction will be because
[35:56] remember you reap
[35:58] what you sow and the most
[36:02] powerful tool that we as a christian
[36:04] here they have
[36:05] that can bring life and death
[36:08] is this thing the tongue the mouth
[36:12] and he says you speak with your mouth
[36:16] you speak with your mouth you you don't
[36:18] honor me with your lips
[36:21] your tongue is so deceitful so deceitful
[36:25] and it could bring healing and it could
[36:27] bring death
[36:29] so we must watch every word we say it's
[36:31] not even sermon we
[36:32] we're about to to go into the heavenlies
[36:34] with the lord where he gives us the
[36:35] overcoming power but just
[36:37] just as a basis there is a time where
[36:39] god has to absolutely take you
[36:41] and just say hey wake up
[36:45] it's later than you think and what you
[36:47] say has the effect on people
[36:49] and what you do can cost someone their
[36:52] salvation and even your conduct
[36:54] in church i will deal with you my son
[36:57] and my daughter
[36:59] and god does not let his sons and
[37:01] daughter get away with that
[37:03] if you read the old testament and you
[37:04] read the new testament
[37:06] if david fell and he did something wrong
[37:08] god dealt with it
[37:10] when moses did something wrong god dealt
[37:12] with it sin
[37:13] is dealt with and the wonderful thing is
[37:17] the wages of sin is death
[37:20] so now i'm saying i'm a sinner lord
[37:24] i made a mistake so the thing that has
[37:27] to fall on me now is death
[37:29] because god don't sit in his word and
[37:31] don't keep it
[37:33] but how did i bypass and got grace how
[37:36] did that happen
[37:37] how did all of a sudden from a death
[37:39] sentence to the grave
[37:40] that i get mercy and now i'm white as
[37:42] snow
[37:44] how did that happen and we sang it
[37:46] tonight
[37:47] and we're going to read it now amen
[37:49] let's go to john 19.
[37:54] see all the things that we we talk about
[37:56] it's it sounds heavy but actually
[37:59] it is just god revealing more and more
[38:02] of himself to us to show us that
[38:04] there is a way that we can overcome
[38:06] there is a way that you can find
[38:08] your answer and it's in the word of god
[38:10] but are you seeking it
[38:12] or are you looking for excuses
[38:15] how many times have you reasoned above
[38:17] reasoning let's go to verse 31 please
[38:19] say
[38:19] um talia
[38:24] how many times has god corrected us
[38:27] so john 19 and verse 31. okay so
[38:32] before we jump into there i want you to
[38:34] now go
[38:36] and think how do i overcome
[38:39] how do i get into the rapture how do i
[38:42] even deserve this
[38:43] and what is my purpose here what is my
[38:47] purpose here am i just going to be every
[38:49] wednesday night in church
[38:50] am i just going to be every sunday at
[38:52] church is it going to become a habit
[38:54] is it going to become a religion why are
[38:57] we here
[38:59] it is a good question why and if you
[39:03] cannot answer it tonight i
[39:05] i encourage you to open your ears
[39:07] because he says he
[39:08] that have a ear led him but let him
[39:12] not he that every year let him just go
[39:14] past hear what he's saying he's speaking
[39:16] to you young and old if you don't
[39:18] understand the why you are here
[39:20] i promise you the lord has his answer
[39:22] tonight
[39:23] just listen jesus therefore because
[39:27] it was the um it was the preparation the
[39:31] jews therefore because it was the
[39:32] preparation so that preparation the word
[39:34] when you go into the strong concordance
[39:37] is the day of getting ready for the
[39:38] sabbath that's what preparation means so
[39:40] they were preparing for the day of
[39:42] sabbath
[39:43] he says that the body should not remain
[39:45] upon the cross
[39:47] on the sabbath day for the sabbath day
[39:50] was the an high day
[39:52] the sword pilate that their legs might
[39:54] be broken
[39:55] and they might be taken away
[39:58] then came the soldiers and break the
[40:01] legs of the first
[40:03] that's the thief and then of the other
[40:06] which was crucified with him so both
[40:08] thieves got their legs broken
[40:10] but when they came to jesus
[40:14] and saw that it was dead already they
[40:16] break
[40:17] not his legs but one of the soldiers
[40:21] with a spear pierced his side
[40:24] and forthwith came there out blood
[40:28] and water and our prophet says
[40:33] jesus christ the nails in his hands
[40:37] it's not what killed him the loss of
[40:39] blood when they whipped him it's not
[40:41] what killed him
[40:42] it was a broken heart because he came to
[40:46] his own
[40:46] and his own received him not so the jews
[40:49] knew jesus was the messiah
[40:51] there was no doubt about it the the word
[40:54] said the virgin shall conceive
[40:56] their very bible said and we went into
[40:58] the bible study as well said he'll be
[41:00] hung between malfectus
[41:01] they said you'll be buried between the
[41:03] rich they said he
[41:05] he'll be on the cross and david said my
[41:06] god my god why have they forsaken me
[41:11] my bones stare at me they knew he was
[41:14] going to be naked
[41:15] all the prophecies that was there they
[41:17] knew it was him
[41:18] this was not done in a secret place this
[41:21] was not done in the secret
[41:22] and the very pharisees and sachses that
[41:24] knew the word more than anyone else
[41:26] crucified him that day but it had to
[41:30] happen
[41:31] it had to happen but see now jesus dies
[41:34] for us
[41:35] and here he uses the example so now
[41:37] you're in church we get striving
[41:39] we get people that don't agree with each
[41:41] other we get sometimes i just don't
[41:42] understand some things
[41:44] and we even look out at the people
[41:46] outside and say lord there's no grace
[41:48] for them because this world is so dark
[41:49] and so evil
[41:51] but where is the heart of christ
[41:55] where is this heart that was hanging
[41:58] upon a cross
[41:59] looking at the very people he came to
[42:02] save
[42:04] they crucify him and he dies because his
[42:08] heart is broken because they cannot see
[42:10] the truth in that very present day
[42:12] because there's some issue or some
[42:15] stronghold and some form of
[42:16] pride because they had to deny
[42:19] themselves to receive christ
[42:21] that was blocking them from receiving it
[42:24] how many times do we sit and we know
[42:27] that the lord is busy talking to you
[42:29] busy talking to you and you make it like
[42:32] this
[42:36] definitely he's preaching there oh yeah
[42:37] i know that he's preaching there
[42:39] now come on you cannot do that you must
[42:42] take every word on for yourself
[42:45] god don't come and preach here over a
[42:47] pulpit to correct your brother
[42:50] it's for you and if you are doing this
[42:53] then you're actually missing what the
[42:55] lord is telling you
[43:00] so it says like this look at this life
[43:03] look his prophecies was there
[43:05] it was all talking about himself now he
[43:08] overcame
[43:09] because before he died on the cross
[43:12] before he died on that cross
[43:14] he had to overcome himself
[43:17] because when the cup was then he was
[43:19] praying and he said lord let this cup
[43:21] depart from me
[43:22] but if not thy will be done so he had to
[43:25] forsake himself he had to get to such a
[43:27] place that he consider himself nothing
[43:30] now how can we as a church move on with
[43:33] god
[43:33] if we ever are something we cannot
[43:38] we cannot brother ben preached about the
[43:40] foot wash flunky
[43:42] he was prepared here comes jesus's feet
[43:44] he can wash it he had a chance of
[43:45] everything
[43:46] and he chose to look at this one because
[43:48] if this one does it then i won't do it
[43:50] then this one will do it and
[43:51] and it kind of struck me and said lord
[43:52] what am i doing
[43:54] at this very moment is it actually
[43:56] furthering your kingdom
[43:58] am i humble am i low am i meek or am i
[44:01] getting heavy high minded and full of
[44:03] anything and if it is so correct me lord
[44:06] help me because i'm going in a rapture
[44:09] if i take those
[44:10] baggage and body and all these other
[44:12] things with me
[44:13] i cannot overcome my enemy if my enemy
[44:16] is playing mind games in my head the
[44:18] whole time
[44:19] i cannot overcome so we have to be in
[44:22] the spirit of christ and he says here
[44:23] now we use the
[44:24] the the example of stephen and he says
[44:28] the prophet says here
[44:29] like your fathers did also so you do he
[44:32] says
[44:32] he was god's advertisement board stephen
[44:35] and when they stoned him to death
[44:37] throwed him outside in the city and beat
[44:40] him to death with stones
[44:43] when he was dying he raised his head to
[44:45] heaven and he asked forgiveness
[44:47] and for those who were stoning him the
[44:50] same as
[44:51] jesus did at the cross
[44:54] the life of christ say lord i got it
[44:56] wrong forgive me
[44:58] they got it wrong forgive them the heart
[45:01] of the christian
[45:02] is not anything for ourselves it's all
[45:05] for him
[45:06] no matter how right stephen was every
[45:09] word he preached on that day was thus
[45:11] say of the lord it was correct hundred
[45:14] percent
[45:15] and here he finds himself outside a city
[45:18] on his knees and they throwing him with
[45:19] stones
[45:20] he's brothers and sisters and what is
[45:23] his
[45:24] attitude towards them forgive them
[45:28] as jesus forgave me because he wasn't
[45:31] preaching anything else but what was in
[45:33] this word
[45:36] and it goes on and it says then god seen
[45:39] a little advertisement board taking
[45:42] being taken down stephen looked up at
[45:44] heaven and said behold i see heavens
[45:46] open and jesus standing on the right
[45:47] hand of god
[45:49] and he fell asleep in the arms of god
[45:51] and he was an advertisement
[45:53] board for a hungry world
[45:58] you say well how many was there you say
[46:01] that there was maybe five thousand how
[46:04] many got saved
[46:05] there was one
[46:08] one the greatest sacrifice this man
[46:12] could give
[46:13] his own life stephen saved one life
[46:18] started the journey for one person
[46:22] for saul because who was holding the
[46:24] coat
[46:25] while they were doing it and who was
[46:28] looking at this man is saying something
[46:30] here
[46:30] is different because there must have
[46:34] been something because jesus said when
[46:36] he was persecuting me and the light
[46:37] struck him he said you're kicking
[46:39] against the prick so somewhere
[46:40] inside there was already a battle going
[46:43] and he was just pushing that down
[46:44] because he
[46:45] thought in his doctrine and his learning
[46:47] and his experience that he was
[46:49] right so he was sure that the words and
[46:53] doctrines of men
[46:54] kept him so right that when when this
[46:56] confrontation and he saw jesus
[46:58] stephen dying there and something
[47:01] started pricking and saying
[47:02] something's going on here you're missing
[47:04] something
[47:05] he did not walk away from that thing all
[47:07] being oh yes someone died today
[47:10] you cannot tell me that because why did
[47:11] jesus say why persecute the
[47:14] persecutors thou me and it's hard to
[47:16] kick against the pricks what was
[47:17] preaching this man's life
[47:19] what was in him what was first he said
[47:21] but this guy is different and
[47:22] these guys want to kill and and but no
[47:24] i'm strong in the faith and i'm a
[47:26] pharisee of the pharisees and
[47:28] because there was a battle raging inside
[47:30] but see god
[47:31] knew when to step on that scene and it's
[47:35] the same with each one of us the same
[47:36] example applied to our lives every day
[47:38] we get to a stage where we have to
[47:40] sacrifice
[47:42] and get down on my knees and say lord
[47:44] you
[47:45] just let the stones fall and kill that
[47:48] old nature
[47:49] and if i can kill that old nature and it
[47:52] can bring one person into the world
[47:54] one person into the presence of god
[47:56] isn't that what it's worth
[47:59] isn't that what it's worth what are we
[48:00] here for to be an advertisement board
[48:03] to be a time-tested memorial no matter
[48:06] how
[48:06] bad it is no matter how good it is to
[48:10] stay with the word
[48:11] and to stay at a posted duty and admit
[48:14] when you're wrong
[48:20] he says well he never accepted it then
[48:25] but years later there was one
[48:28] help the coat saul a young pharisee
[48:30] standing there
[48:34] consulted and gave a witness of his
[48:36] death but when he saw the advertisement
[48:38] and the power of the resurrection the
[48:40] resurrected christ in that little fellow
[48:43] he never got away from him the same man
[48:46] paul
[48:47] the one standing there led tens
[48:50] and thousands of souls to christ because
[48:53] one man
[48:54] was willing to give his life to be
[48:56] advertisement board for christ
[48:58] what order we do today
[49:07] now i'm going to ask the kids a question
[49:10] children
[49:11] raise your hands if you know well what
[49:13] do you see here
[49:15] rebecca a white dot
[49:18] okay this is gonna be this is this is a
[49:20] tough one
[49:22] okay jonathan
[49:26] a black dot okay
[49:30] this is there's something to it what do
[49:32] you see now
[49:34] liam nothing
[49:40] a white paper see there's something you
[49:42] all missed
[49:44] this is a black paper with a white dot
[49:49] this is a white paper with a black dot
[49:54] and this is a white paper
[49:57] this is before i met the lord
[50:00] i was always a part of god no matter how
[50:04] dark in sin i was
[50:07] he was there because he said if you're
[50:10] my seed
[50:12] i'll never lose you
[50:15] so that nothing that i was there was god
[50:18] in it
[50:20] now he's busy changing my life
[50:23] and now i've got a lot of good things
[50:25] but people keep seeing that little black
[50:27] dot
[50:29] huh they keep seeing this little
[50:32] stupid black dot when everything else i
[50:36] do
[50:37] is for him but what does god see
[50:42] what does god see what are we supposed
[50:46] to see
[50:47] the sin the sinner
[50:51] or god what is the viewpoint of a
[50:54] christian
[50:56] the black dot
[51:00] is it so far that jesus would die on a
[51:02] cross
[51:03] so that we can still see a black dot
[51:07] when he sees this who has the right to
[51:10] pull
[51:10] any sin out of the blood of jesus christ
[51:13] if that man has a right stand
[51:16] no one can take the blood that i've put
[51:19] under the blood of jesus christ
[51:21] and attributed to me doesn't work that
[51:24] way
[51:25] god sees me as this and every time i
[51:28] fail and i repent and i say lord man the
[51:30] blood of jesus christ cleans me
[51:32] he sees me as this for i never did it in
[51:35] the first place
[51:37] so why don't we as a church stop seeing
[51:40] this
[51:42] start seeing this because isn't this the
[51:44] very mind of christ
[51:46] isn't this why he died for all sin
[51:50] not some of it but all
[51:54] i didn't come here to play church
[51:57] i came here because he gave me from this
[52:00] and he's busy with this
[52:02] and he sees me here that's why we're
[52:05] here
[52:06] you don't come to church to warm up you
[52:09] you come at church too
[52:10] so god can work on this because he sees
[52:13] you as this
[52:21] so i want to write a word here because
[52:23] this is what i firmly believe you are
[52:41] a whip this is what i believe we are
[52:44] a whip because they hit him
[52:49] with that whip with the four strains
[52:52] and the wire on it they they carved up
[52:55] his back
[52:56] we ever watched the movie passion of
[52:58] christ
[52:59] when they hit that man and you could see
[53:02] the
[53:03] the the deep wounds on his back satan
[53:06] was laughing because
[53:07] he got to whip the lord jesus christ
[53:10] but see what this stands for as a work
[53:15] healing in progress
[53:20] all of us is a work and a healing in
[53:23] progress because when we were walking
[53:25] here
[53:26] there was a lot of hurts there was a lot
[53:28] of things that happened in our life
[53:30] and it was a lot of things that made us
[53:32] the way we made and that's fine
[53:34] that's history but we are a whip
[53:38] and what means is we see each one of us
[53:41] as something that was there
[53:43] to put against our enemy to show that we
[53:45] have overcoming power god didn't make a
[53:47] bride in this age
[53:49] to fall you know you're all going in a
[53:52] rapture hey
[53:54] i'm sure you know we're all going in the
[53:56] rapture you cannot go into a rapture by
[53:59] by the way with this little dot on you
[54:03] because god is going to take the holy
[54:04] spirit off this ground
[54:06] and the holy spirit don't have any dots
[54:08] on it this is the holy spirit
[54:10] okay so just think about this when you
[54:13] look at your brother and sister
[54:15] think of them as a whip for the enemy's
[54:18] back
[54:20] because he had his chance to whip the
[54:21] lord jesus christ but our god don't work
[54:24] like that
[54:24] he said i will bring forth a bride in
[54:27] such a way that you will not know what
[54:29] to do with her
[54:30] if you come with temptation she will
[54:32] deny you if you come with malice and
[54:34] strife she will walk away
[54:36] she will pray before she walks she will
[54:38] pray before she talks
[54:39] she will pray before she does anything
[54:41] because she does not
[54:43] want you to rule over her because
[54:46] he cannot rule over you because you're
[54:49] this
[54:51] so just remember as much as we look at
[54:54] each other
[54:55] never ever ever ever ever
[54:58] see the sin because you cut the
[55:01] influence of a brother and sister off
[55:04] none of us are perfect yet god sees us
[55:06] perfect but
[55:08] we are walking we are all work in
[55:12] progress
[55:14] and healing takes time
[55:18] healing takes time these things still
[55:20] now in my life
[55:22] where i haven't found healing from
[55:25] because when i was back in the world i
[55:27] opened myself up to become this
[55:29] so i pray and i encourage you before we
[55:32] pray tonight
[55:33] why don't you seek your heart in front
[55:37] of the holy god
[55:38] that is pure and it's deity and say lord
[55:41] if there is
[55:42] anything that's in my heart that could
[55:44] cause me not
[55:46] to see someone as a finnish work of god
[55:50] remove it in the name of jesus christ
[55:53] because we didn't come here to play
[55:54] church
[55:58] and i cannot correct you is what the
[56:00] lord gave me it says in ephesians he
[56:02] says
[56:02] ephesians 6 13 it says wherefore take
[56:05] unto you the whole armor of god
[56:07] this is good in your fight he says
[56:10] that ye may be able to withstand the
[56:12] evil
[56:13] day and having done all to stand
[56:20] the man that knows that the lord is
[56:22] leading him
[56:23] must stand where the lord has placed him
[56:26] don't worry about the scoffers there's
[56:28] enough
[56:28] of them stephen didn't worry about who
[56:32] stoned him
[56:34] jesus didn't worry about who crucified
[56:36] him
[56:37] noah didn't worry about who was telling
[56:39] and mocking him when he's building the
[56:41] boat
[56:41] okay moses didn't listen to quran nathan
[56:46] yet he was still crying out for them
[56:47] when god wanted to swallow them up
[56:50] the whole thing is you don't need to do
[56:52] anything
[56:53] else but surrender and just let god
[56:56] live don't ever take a sermon over the
[57:00] pulpit
[57:00] as something otherwise as personal to
[57:03] you
[57:05] don't it's the biggest mistake we can do
[57:07] when we say brother ben is speaking to
[57:09] that brother
[57:10] and that that system oh i feel it's a
[57:12] bit more there and don't do that because
[57:14] you actually then causing that person
[57:16] not to be a whip you're cutting off that
[57:19] testimony that that highest for you
[57:22] no one else only you
[57:25] we cannot do it so when you pray
[57:28] i used to lie and i said to to the kids
[57:30] and i hate to confess it and i'll finish
[57:32] with this
[57:33] long time ago i said that a spite it was
[57:36] the hardest thing i ever done
[57:38] okay i said when i used to do
[57:40] rollerblades
[57:42] i used to ride down the hills and then
[57:45] i'll and
[57:46] i could do it but what happens is you'll
[57:48] lean down on on your back wheel on your
[57:49] front wheels like this going down the
[57:51] hill and then i'll
[57:52] go under a truck and through the trailer
[57:54] but i lied
[57:57] so i was sharing this in a bible study
[57:59] with the children
[58:00] and i walked out and i kind of felt a
[58:02] bit oh i shared something there you know
[58:04] and then the lord corrected me straight
[58:06] after that says what if a child
[58:09] goes and does that and ends up under
[58:12] that truck because
[58:13] you has lied
[58:17] so the next two weeks i was fighting
[58:18] this thing it was the biggest thing
[58:20] because i had to go back into the class
[58:22] and tell the kids and he said to me you
[58:24] will go back and you will tell them
[58:26] you lied
[58:31] now if you know kids they think you're a
[58:34] hero
[58:35] when you cool and now all of a sudden in
[58:39] this cool year of struts in the class
[58:41] and he goes hey kids
[58:42] i've got something to tell you i lied
[58:46] and they're like why would you lie to us
[58:49] he was like so super cool and now you
[58:52] lied to us
[58:53] but i did and because i'm telling you i
[58:56] lied to you is because
[58:58] if i made a mistake and i said i'm sorry
[59:01] the lord forgives me but i need to tell
[59:03] you guys as well
[59:04] i made a mistake because if you see me
[59:07] without sin
[59:08] and you ever sin what example was i to
[59:11] you
[59:12] i said and heaven forbid that any one of
[59:14] you would ever try something i tell you
[59:16] in a lie and you get hurt that will
[59:19] forever be on my head because i couldn't
[59:21] speak
[59:22] one word of truth and that is why the
[59:25] devil hates a liar
[59:28] so when you pray for people pray in
[59:30] sincerity when you look at people see
[59:31] work in progress
[59:32] am i raptured no i'm not is anyone else
[59:35] for us in the environment yet
[59:36] no are we still going to make mistake is
[59:38] there trials coming
[59:39] yes that's right okay am i going to be
[59:43] that annoying guy with a big nose
[59:44] yes okay i can't help it because some
[59:48] things in trades in my life god's still
[59:50] dealing with but i
[59:51] ain't there yet but god sees me as this
[59:54] so you have no right to see me any other
[59:56] way
[59:56] hallelujah no other way and so me you
[1:00:01] and so when god corrected me this week i
[1:00:04] went back on my knees and said lord you

[1:00:12] on calvary when brother branham preached
[1:00:14] that cross
[1:00:15] and he said that he died from a broken

[1:00:24] somebody that can go to the lord and say
[1:00:26] sorry

[1:00:31] and he can walk with a man like that
[1:00:34] though he corrects him
[1:00:36] so we've got a couple of pre-requests
