[26:26] you to step forth out of the book lord

[27:17] any Spirit that's contrary to your Holy
[27:19] Spirit may that be Cast Away now in the
[27:21] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[27:24] amen amen Saints you can have your seats
[27:30] um I was going to preach about the Three
[27:33] Little Pigs tonight and
[27:35] uh the Lord said no so we're going to
[27:38] preach about Psalm
[27:42] 37 Psalm
[27:45] 37 the title of it is trust in the
[27:49] Lord so see no matter what happens and I
[27:53] don't know how this will go brother Ben
[27:55] but I know the Lord's laid it on my
[27:57] heart but the Lord does doesn't want us
[27:59] to look at
[28:00] circumstance you understand faith is the
[28:04] thing he's looking for he said when I
[28:06] shall return home when I come back shall
[28:08] I find faith not just Believers not just
[28:13] righteous people but will I find a form
[28:15] of faith that would touch
[28:18] me so remember if we look at every
[28:20] believer in the in the in the scriptures
[28:23] they they come to God with a certain
[28:25] amount of faith and they believe that
[28:27] God can do it but see there's a
[28:30] need but because when the need came to
[28:33] the believer like the woman at the well
[28:35] or like the woman with the blood issue
[28:37] there was a need in her life there was a
[28:40] condition she was sitting with and she
[28:42] couldn't get rid of it but she knew that
[28:44] she had to get to Jesus but the there
[28:47] had to be a need now you can't be a
[28:49] Overcomer if there's nothing to overcome
[28:53] you can't have a testimony if there's no
[28:55] test so let me tell you we're going to
[28:57] get pred and we're going to get tested
[28:59] do you understand what I mean this is
[29:00] not a flowery bed of ease this is life
[29:04] and death but see God is the lover of
[29:07] your soul he doesn't care about your
[29:10] conditions right now because he has a
[29:12] greater plan for you and everything
[29:13] worketh together for the good but
[29:16] sometimes we so stuck in the trial we're
[29:18] so stuck in that that little scene
[29:20] that's we playing out in that little bit
[29:22] of vision that he's giving us now that
[29:24] carnal realm that we kind of forget what
[29:27] type of God we are serving we forget the
[29:30] mighty powerful God that we are serving
[29:33] and so when I was sitting at home and
[29:35] and shantala and I we had a couple of
[29:37] discussions just briefly today and I
[29:39] really wanted to talk about the Three
[29:41] Little Pigs but this Psalm pressed upon
[29:44] my heart and I quickly put it down and I
[29:46] thought you know what it's a pray
[29:48] meeting I'm just going to deliver some
[29:50] mail so I want you to read with me cuz I
[29:52] don't read always the best so you don't
[29:54] lose me I've put it on nice and bold and
[29:56] everything that I want to clate I've put
[29:59] on there so if you see me miss a line or
[30:01] two forgive me read the psalm if you
[30:04] want to open up in your Bibles as well
[30:06] so David comes to a point where he knows
[30:10] he needs to trust in the Lord he knows
[30:13] there's no other way now so we're not
[30:15] talking circumstance when he wrote The
[30:17] Psalm or anything he knows he needs to
[30:19] trust in the Lord and he starts off with
[30:21] that he says fret not thyselves because
[30:23] of evildoers so of course he had a lot
[30:26] of Mischief in the camp a lot of things
[30:28] going on around him neither be envious
[30:31] against the workers of iniquity so no
[30:34] matter how the people are prospering now
[30:36] you children you can keep in the summon
[30:38] as well because you see some kids at
[30:40] school and they look like they're just
[30:41] rolling money and they're so cool and
[30:44] awesome and powerful and and these type
[30:46] of units in school that you're thinking
[30:48] man this guy is the naughtiest kid in
[30:50] class but everybody likes him those type
[30:52] of things that's evildoers it's workers
[30:54] of iniquity they they they don't believe
[30:56] in God they don't care they so in this
[30:59] world man Even If You Preach to them
[31:01] they'll laugh in your face so don't take
[31:03] this now as just for mommy and daddy
[31:04] make this yours put it in your situation
[31:07] put you in this feet he says for soon
[31:09] they shall be cut down like grass now I
[31:11] don't say we get the attitude as a
[31:12] Christian to go if they don't believe
[31:14] what we do there's no Grace for them you
[31:17] know we we're the heart of Christ we
[31:19] want everyone to be there we really want
[31:21] and we want to minister to them and and
[31:23] say there's a God That Forgives sins and
[31:25] that heals and and that can put your
[31:27] family together because you know why
[31:29] these kids act out because their parents
[31:31] act out against each other you know why
[31:33] they're so miserable in class because
[31:34] their parents are miserable so there's a
[31:36] lot of things going on that you might
[31:38] not see that don't mean they're happy
[31:40] and they've got it all
[31:42] together so David's looking at this and
[31:44] they say and they whiter as the green
[31:46] herb he says but trust in the Lord and
[31:49] do good and thou shalt dwell in the land
[31:52] and verily Thou shalt be fed he says so
[31:55] there is certain rewards for serving God
[31:58] the feeding is always not always natural
[32:00] food have you seen the time Jonathan
[32:03] when you don't read your Bible all of a
[32:05] sudden Things become a bit harder the
[32:08] time when you're not worshiping God or
[32:09] sitting in praying and and you know
[32:11] having communion with God then then
[32:13] things around you gets a bit more harder
[32:15] he Josh and you feeling my diet my
[32:18] strength is gone from me I'm a bit
[32:20] weaker today you know people irritate me
[32:23] faster things annoy me faster because it
[32:26] says trust in the Lord and and do good
[32:28] good so that's that's something for us
[32:31] and David sees this it's a prayer
[32:33] meeting so go on then he turns it he
[32:36] says while you're doing it delight
[32:38] yourself in the Lord you know Jo sitting
[32:40] in his in his room and he's playing
[32:42] guitar and he had a rough day at school
[32:45] and he changes that very scenario and he
[32:46] starts praying and he just starts
[32:49] worshiping the Lord in his room and all
[32:51] of a sudden everything you're going
[32:52] through it just goes away from you
[32:54] because see you you choose to take to
[32:56] dwell in the carnal Mor and you choose
[32:58] to go just that little bit higher
[33:00] brother B preached it so wonderful that
[33:02] Eagle Vision you you just see it a
[33:03] little bit different but it takes a lot
[33:06] to pick up the guitar when you're angry
[33:09] takes a lot to pick up the guitar when
[33:11] you're frustrated at your dad or
[33:13] something you know or your brother or it
[33:15] takes a lot to get yourself out of that
[33:19] situation to get up there but you need
[33:21] to do
[33:22] it you know God is great and he's all
[33:25] powerful but he doesn't want robots he
[33:27] wants people with a testimony with some
[33:29] grit in them that when everything goes
[33:31] wrong to say you know what hold on I'll
[33:33] Delight myself in the Lord I'll turn my
[33:36] focus from this trial and I'll make it a
[33:39] testimony but it has to start with you
[33:41] it's a real battle and this is where the
[33:44] battle
[33:45] starts he says also shall it give you
[33:47] the desires of your
[33:49] heart so see God will not withheld
[33:52] anything from you he knows what's in
[33:55] here
[33:56] pure and not so P spiritual and very
[34:00] carnal I like a for Raptor that would be
[34:03] great I don't think it will add to my
[34:05] faith if God gives me one but it would
[34:07] be nice you know so he's not talking
[34:10] about those desires of the heart the
[34:11] desires of a heart of a Believer is to
[34:14] see him become the present God the
[34:17] desires of a heart of a Believer sister
[34:19] Vanessa is to see your children all come
[34:21] in you know the desires of your heart is
[34:24] different than these things it's not
[34:25] material things they will all burn
[34:28] but it's Eternal things I want to see my
[34:30] friends there you know so when you start
[34:32] turning this the psalm and you start
[34:34] looking at David he wasn't looking at
[34:36] carnal things he was looking at the
[34:38] things that's really in his
[34:40] heart and then he goes on he says commit
[34:42] thy way unto the Lord trusteth in him
[34:45] and he shall bring it to
[34:47] pass so yes I believe Lord now I'm going
[34:51] to walk it I'm going to testify to it
[34:53] I'm going to commit it into your hands
[34:55] now you don't pick it up and touch it
[34:57] again you've committed it because doubt
[34:59] with brother brandham said the moment
[35:01] the sister started doubting or the
[35:02] brother started doubting he said you
[35:04] lost it right there you had your
[35:06] healing but then you lost it right there
[35:08] because doubt came in we don't doubt we
[35:12] made Believers the devil wants you to
[35:14] doubt but your made Believers we just
[35:17] believe how don't know when don't know
[35:20] but it's coming amen so don't you worry
[35:24] about the logistics God knows how to run
[35:26] his business
[35:28] he says and it shall bring forth
[35:30] righteousness as the
[35:32] light have you ever been in a situation
[35:34] where everybody looks at your situation
[35:36] and go oh boy you're going this there's
[35:39] something wrong oh job you're losing
[35:41] everything again and you're thinking
[35:43] about oh how am I going to make this but
[35:45] see God knew Job was a righteous man he
[35:49] knew what was job was going to stand for
[35:52] and so when he put him in that trial he
[35:53] knew the only thing it's going to bring
[35:55] out is his righteousness he will shine
[35:57] like a light even if his friends has
[35:59] told him that he's a secret
[36:01] sinner they know that at the end of that
[36:04] trial he was still a righteous man so
[36:07] God knows how to put you in a trial to
[36:08] bring forth what is what he's put inside
[36:10] of you this is the important part of it
[36:13] rest in the Lord hallelujah but rest is
[36:19] get your hands off that
[36:22] trial rest is when you say God I can't
[36:26] do it I remember when my my dad and my
[36:30] mom you know when they were here and we
[36:31] tried to get all mingled in there and
[36:33] try to you know bring them to the Lord
[36:36] and do everything humanly possible which
[36:38] you do because you you just love the
[36:39] Lord the moment I took my hands off it
[36:42] the moment I rested God came on the
[36:45] scene sometimes he'll take you to that
[36:47] very point and then you'll come on the
[36:50] scene it's not fun sister margi it's not
[36:54] fun but he'll come on the scene you see
[36:57] what I mean I mean he's a personal God
[37:01] every one of your trials is not like my
[37:02] trial and it and it's all right because
[37:05] God has something different to show in
[37:07] your life don't don't think them don't
[37:10] think them anything but God's showing
[37:12] something it's in you you might even not
[37:14] know it's there right now he says and
[37:17] wait patiently for
[37:19] him fret not thyself because of who
[37:22] prosper in his way because the man who
[37:25] bringeth Wicked devices to pass cease
[37:27] from anger and forsake
[37:30] wrath how many of us has been in a trial
[37:33] we get angry not always at God but you
[37:36] just get so angry brother
[37:39] Ben he did it once when he was talking
[37:41] to me goes I get so
[37:43] angry but I can understand because our
[37:47] flesh is
[37:49] still it's still flesh and brother
[37:51] Isaac's sermon was so beautiful it's the
[37:53] same same um chemicals coming to your
[37:56] brain it's just how you act to it so we
[37:59] don't get angry he says don't get angry
[38:01] don't don't don't forsake wrath don't
[38:03] get angry don't you get worked up I've
[38:06] got this he says for yet a little while
[38:08] and the wicked shall not be there yay
[38:10] thou shall um diligently consider his
[38:12] place and it shall not be he says but
[38:16] the meek shall inherit oh wait sorry
[38:19] sorry you should have corrected me there
[38:22] yeah for the evildoers shall be cut off
[38:24] and those wait upon the Lord they shall
[38:27] inherit the Earth so hold on guys so I
[38:31] don't get my Ford Ranger I I don't get
[38:34] those nice things here on Earth but wait
[38:38] there's something greater that the Lord
[38:39] has for me that city that is built it's
[38:44] going to come up one day like that
[38:45] pyramid remember when we did the whole
[38:46] pyramid thing man I can just imagine
[38:49] you're standing in front of the city of
[38:50] God and and it is your place it's just
[38:53] your home I don't know how big it's
[38:55] going to be it's going to be massive
[38:56] okay that's my place my dwelling place
[38:59] is not here this is my training ground
[39:01] this is not the place I want to end up
[39:03] guess what I've seen every phone out

[39:08] boring they all have the same line they
[39:10] all look the same all the actors are the
[39:12] same they all do the same thing you
[39:14] expect the end it's all the same over
[39:18] and over and you can watch Friends the
[39:20] whole series of friends it's still as
[39:22] lame as the whole Beverly Hills 90210
[39:24] that we watch it's all the same jargon
[39:28] it's nothing new they just they put it
[39:29] in a washing machine and they tumble it
[39:31] a couple of times and it's the same
[39:33] story line he falls in love she falls in
[39:36] love breaks up or does cut back together
[39:38] one dies one lives blah blah
[39:41] life but in the end of the day once
[39:43] you've seen all the movies guess what
[39:45] you get to it's lame it's all the same
[39:49] It's
[39:51] Entertainment so I want to ask you
[39:52] something it was going to be in my other
[39:54] sermon but I want to ask you you guys
[39:55] that love music who loves God gospel
[39:57] songs raise your
[39:59] hand raise that up man come on I want to
[40:01] see gospel songs love it okay now this

[40:08] gospel songs the whole
[40:11] day whole
[40:13] day wow okay who loves reading their
[40:18] Bible who loves reading their Bible the
[40:20] whole
[40:23] day I want to I want to just bring
[40:25] something in here cuz I saw Josh looking
[40:27] think at be
[40:28] funny see the word of God is your
[40:31] strength it's the
[40:33] sword I I want to drop this in the word
[40:36] of God is me as a Christian when I used
[40:39] to be a non-Christian I majored on
[40:43] music and music caters to a to a a
[40:46] feeling to a emotion if you play me
[40:50] Brian Adams song right now you will take
[40:52] me back to
[40:55] 1998 if you play me any other song
[40:58] before 98 Say songs of 2000 I can name
[41:01] you a whole list that I listened to from
[41:03] RM to Midnight Oil all the songs that
[41:05] you think they sing and by the way Ed
[41:07] and I spoke to about they still
[41:08] listening to our songs brother that we
[41:10] listened to When We Were Young it's
[41:12] still the same jargon it's still the
[41:14] same thing wrapped up in a new piece of
[41:16] paper and everybody listens to it it's
[41:18] the same but see it's so powerful that
[41:22] it can transfer you Seline Dion sang a
[41:25] song one day okay and every time I
[41:28] listened to this song when I was in the
[41:30] world no matter how many years after it
[41:31] takes me straight back to my first
[41:33] girlfriend that I
[41:35] had why I walk in a shopping center I am
[41:39] saved redeemed Love Gospel songs okay
[41:42] don't get me wrong I don't listen to
[41:43] worldly music anymore praise the Lord
[41:45] tast change but I walk in the mall and
[41:48] Seline Dion singing a song and all of a
[41:50] sudden I go boom right back there how
[41:53] powerful is
[41:55] music now I want to tell you you that
[41:57] gospel music is the same because why
[42:01] does gospel music it's not my notes but
[42:03] we're going to go on with this thing why
[42:04] is gospel music have to have a
[42:06] genre why have you ever thought about it
[42:09] why does there have to be rock and roll
[42:11] and hip hop and rap and all these
[42:13] nonsense in gospel music they want to
[42:17] get you to get to the tune and not the
[42:20] word cuz the tune keeps you busy it's
[42:23] like whistling when you go through a
[42:24] graveyard keeps you busy it ain't say
[42:27] saing your soul it keeps you maybe in
[42:30] the presence of a God but not the real
[42:32] God let me tell you that the songs
[42:35] cannot give you overcoming power it's to
[42:38] worship God it's to get you into a a a a
[42:41] state of worship or praise but it ain't
[42:44] going to save you because the the the
[42:47] word is the thing that unlocks
[42:49] everything in you Revelation comes by
[42:51] the word of God he says the word of God
[42:53] is sharper than any two8 sort cutting
[42:57] getting the marrow and the bone they cut
[42:59] so deeply get everything in it it's the
[43:01] word of God so if you're majoring on
[43:03] music every day what are you actually
[43:05] eating are are we having some nutrients
[43:08] or are you chewing
[43:10] McDonald's because it's a meal it makes
[43:13] you
[43:14] happy but it ain't the word of God how
[43:16] many of you listen more brother brandom
[43:18] tapes than they listen to
[43:20] music how many of you listen to the
[43:23] audio
[43:24] Bible who have you reads the Bible more
[43:26] than then you listen to music so I'm I'm
[43:28] trying to just say something you you be
[43:31] we we get skinny and we struggle but
[43:34] because we major on music and not the
[43:36] word of God don't do it cuz you'll find
[43:40] yourself in a trial you'll find you in a
[43:42] place where where David needed the word
[43:44] of God in his trial he needed to bring
[43:46] forth the promises of God they said I
[43:48] will not leave my Holy One to see
[43:50] corruption when he uttered those words
[43:52] when he said my God my God my bones
[43:55] stare at me when Jesus was crucified and
[43:58] he was prophesying the which realm was
[43:59] he dwelling in a musical realm he was in
[44:02] the word of God and he was lost in in
[44:05] God's presence and and the anointing of
[44:07] God was on him it's a different realm we
[44:09] work in music will not get you
[44:12] there you can't listen so if you so what
[44:15] what if we listen on music the whole
[44:16] time and it's not a grip sorry I listen
[44:18] to music as well don't get me wrong I'm
[44:20] not fighting with you but if the music
[44:22] musos come and they play the whole
[44:23] Sunday and we only sing songs is that
[44:28] church so why are we majoring on
[44:33] it sorry that was side note
[44:36] 104 because remember a make believer can
[44:39] listen to Christian music a unbeliever
[44:41] can also listen to that music but a True
[44:44] Believer wants the word of God for his
[44:45] season he wants to know now he says
[44:48] teaching will establish the bride and
[44:50] tell her where she is in her position
[44:52] things that brother Ben spoke about on
[44:54] Sunday where the the horse riders come
[44:56] forth and Revelation happens and God
[44:58] moving in this time and the ladyo seean
[45:00] church Ag and tell us where we at those
[45:02] things get you to overcome because if
[45:04] you don't know where you're going music
[45:06] will get you somewhere else it ain't
[45:08] going to help you
[45:09] overcome it's not going to give you the
[45:11] the strength and the meat when when the
[45:14] tempter is coming and he's shaking your
[45:15] house and he's trying to break you CU
[45:17] remember he hates you he's your enemy
[45:20] and he's shaking you and he's shaking
[45:21] you and you only listen to music your
[45:23] legs will break you will have no
[45:25] strength no nothing in you because
[45:27] you're feeling
[45:29] wrong still listen to music don't get me
[45:32] wrong but let's get into the the the the
[45:35] substenance of the word you'll find
[45:37] you'll be much stronger you'll be ready
[45:40] to fight you'll roll like Ben when he
[45:41] really starts preaching he rolls these
[45:43] sleeps up I'm going man the devil's
[45:45] going to get a pck you know the moment
[45:47] he does this I'm like oh boy here we go
[45:49] because that's when he's starting to get
[45:51] into the word watch it he gets into that
[45:54] word and he starts preaching life
[45:57] but the meek shall inherit the earth and
[45:58] should Delight thems in abundance of
[46:00] Peace what does God want for you he
[46:02] wants peace the wicked plots against the
[46:05] just and they nashes upon the teeth have
[46:07] you ever seen a bully at school you
[46:10] never ever offended the guy you just
[46:13] walked past him I walked into a shop a
[46:14] golf shop the one day won't mention the
[46:17] name and I was just me we were going to
[46:19] play soccer golf with the with shantell
[46:22] and them and and there's my wife she's
[46:25] witness I walk into the golf shop to to
[46:27] pay the round and the guy looks at me as
[46:29] if he wants to kill me and I went like
[46:33] hey I haven't said a word but he looked
[46:37] angry at me his face his whole
[46:38] countenance changed and it was the most
[46:41] evil look a Shantel she's a witness I
[46:44] walked and she goes what did you
[46:47] say like nothing he goes man that guy's
[46:50] face I said I saw it do you not think
[46:52] there's spiritual warfare and then you
[46:54] that's at school there's more of it
[46:58] have you ever thought about it some
[47:00] random girl just calls you names and
[47:01] you're like what did I
[47:03] do it's what's in you that Spirit don't
[47:07] like what's in
[47:09] you but don't worry as far as I know
[47:13] when Legion and we spoke about in the
[47:14] car before Legion got cast out he looked
[47:17] at Jesus he says Jesus of Nazareth have
[47:20] you come to torment us before our time
[47:23] so you're the devil's Tormentor remember
[47:25] that you don't have to agree with him
[47:28] the wicked plot of against you the Lord
[47:29] shall laugh at him look at what David
[47:32] says he says when everything looks D
[47:35] Straits and all the kids are really
[47:36] naughty and bad with you and pushing you
[47:38] down and all those things he says God
[47:40] laughs at him don't worry he laughs at
[47:42] him he says he seeth the day that is
[47:45] coming cuz I spoke to my dad about this
[47:47] earlier in this week and I said the the
[47:49] heart of Christ don't want anybody to to
[47:53] go to hell I I don't want to see anybody
[47:55] I don't want to feel good when somebody
[47:57] goes to hell I really want to feel good
[47:59] that they all go to heaven isn't that
[48:01] our heart but some people just cannot
[48:04] accept God and it is what it is don't
[48:08] reject them don't push them don't don't
[48:10] just it is what it is don't major on the
[48:13] minors that's between them and God you
[48:15] just be as salty as you can be as long
[48:17] as you can don't change your attitude

[48:21] a nice Christian girl get to school and
[48:23] change that don't do that you hold your
[48:26] Tes

[48:30] school that's looking for Jesus and
[48:32] they'll only find it if you really
[48:34] represent what you believe in do you
[48:36] believe that I believe it I was sitting
[48:39] in a office one day and they were
[48:41] playing I'm just going to go a little
[48:43] bit down and they were doing a Bible
[48:45] quiz and I never said I was a Christian
[48:48] and they said what is the shortest verse
[48:49] in the Bible and that I was sitting here
[48:52] and the table is about from Josh from me
[48:54] and they all stopped with one Accord and
[48:56] they looked at me
[48:57] I never said I was a
[48:59] Christian I just conducted myself like a
[49:02] Son of
[49:03] God never preached at them one word and
[49:06] they asked me so what is the shortest
[49:09] verse we all know it's Jesus
[49:13] we a little that a righteous man hath is
[49:16] better than the riches of many Wicked if
[49:19] your dad's not the richest and he
[49:20] doesn't drive that Ford Ranger don't
[49:21] worry boys it's fine little that a
[49:25] righteous man ha that's much in God's

[49:34] suits don't worry you may head it to

[49:41] world with all the
[49:43] luxuries don't worry about money it's
[49:46] not what we're here for for the arms of

[49:54] Inheritance shall be forever see he's
[49:57] not talking about Earthly stuff here he
[49:59] knows where he's going David he says
[50:01] they shall not be asane for the evil
[50:03] time and in the days of famine they
[50:05] shall be
[50:07] satisfied when people don't even know
[50:09] the word of God this ladyo seean church

[50:13] are gone I haven't seen you raise the
[50:14] dead raise the dead brother Ben I'll
[50:16] come to your church when you raise the
[50:19] dead they want to see the great Miracles
[50:22] but they can't have faith to believe for
[50:24] themselves God don't don't cat for those
[50:27] people he doesn't do it that way you
[50:29] cannot tempt the Lord he says but the
[50:31] wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of
[50:33] the Lord shall be as fat lambs and they
[50:35] shall consume like smoke and consume
[50:37] them away the wicked borrow and payeth
[50:39] not again but the righteous Seth mercy

[51:16] shall inherit the earth and they that
[51:18] shall be cursed shall be cut off now
[51:20] here's my here's my
[51:23] thought so it says here the Delights of
[51:25] God in a man
[51:27] he says the steps of a good man are
[51:28] ordered of the Lord and He Delight of in
[51:31] his way so if you do get anything from
[51:34] the service I want you to realize we in
[51:36] a pre meeting God knows your footsteps
[51:39] are
[51:40] ordered he's walked them with you
[51:43] before you're just trapped in time he's
[51:46] in eternity he he knows what you're
[51:48] going to do at this very situation he
[51:49] knows what you're going to do he knows
[51:51] that even if you most the most hurt
[51:53] inside of you where where you you're so
[51:56] vexed and so tormented by by your mind
[52:00] he knows who you're going to stand for
[52:02] he knows where you're going to put your
[52:03] trust don't you think he didn't do it
[52:06] for a
[52:08] reason do you think that when something
[52:10] comes your way God don't know you're
[52:12] going to stand for
[52:13] me when all the chips are down and you
[52:16] got the zig lagac moment you look at men
[52:18] that used to love you and they want to
[52:19] throw rocks at you cuz they hate you cuz
[52:21] they lost
[52:22] everything don't you think David was
[52:25] also in this situation and can testify
[52:27] that he knows that God got him through
[52:29] it he got everything
[52:31] back everything was restored he says
[52:35] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[52:37] cast down for the Lord upholdeth him
[52:39] with his hand I was so lost in the world
[52:42] he is my testimony I was so lost in this
[52:45] world but I was always in his hand I was
[52:48] standing on a water tower the one day we
[52:50] were busy loading a tower on top of a
[52:52] platform 6 M up in the air and
[52:55] underneath us was all the
[52:56] cuts of the pipe so we dig a hole put
[52:58] the big pipe in a pipe like this and you
[53:00] need just cut the pipes and all the
[53:02] Rings and stuff and it's all just lying
[53:03] on the ground big pieces of it and as we
[53:07] we had a pulley on the top and then what
[53:09] happened is the the water big 10,000 L
[53:12] drum is here at the bottom and we're all
[53:14] standing 6 M up on the platform now
[53:17] remember as last as could be I didn't
[53:19] even know God then I wasn't looking for
[53:21] him but he had me in his hand cuz he had
[53:23] a purpose for me and devil wants to to
[53:26] enough your purpose out before God can
[53:28] show you it don't you worry God's got
[53:30] you in his hand don't worry he's got you
[53:32] in his hand so no matter where you find
[53:35] yourself now right now believer
[53:37] unbeliever total misbeliever whatever
[53:39] don't worry God's got you in his hand
[53:41] because he's got your heart and your
[53:43] best interest is is is his everything so
[53:47] I'm standing there and this thing comes
[53:49] up and and as the platforms like this
[53:51] this water tank and the pulley is here
[53:53] comes up and it hits the corner of the
[53:55] whole structure and it starts pulling
[53:58] the the corn the structure over and the
[54:00] guy in the youth is driving and we
[54:01] shouting but he's not hearing and I and
[54:03] I make a judgment call and I'm standing
[54:05] right on the corner there's no space for
[54:07] me and I I grab the tank and I see the
[54:10] water where the water pipe is going to
[54:12] connect and I grab that fitting and I
[54:14] push it and as I push it because the
[54:16] tension's on the Rope it shoots and it
[54:19] pushes me backwards and there was a man
[54:21] standing right next to me and as it
[54:23] pushes me it pushes me off my balance
[54:25] and I'm going over but I didn't go over
[54:28] I'm beyond the point of falling the guy
[54:30] next to me went oh cuz I'm going and
[54:33] here I stand Z straight
[54:36] back and and he looks at me he goes oh
[54:38] buy why why you you you fell I say you
[54:43] fell see yeah I didn't fall I'm
[54:47] standing but what kept me cuz if I fell
[54:51] down there all those pipes and stuff
[54:52] would have cut me to Pieces it was real
[54:55] Satan wanted to have my life that day
[54:57] but he couldn't because God had me in
[54:58] his hand he says because he had a reason
[55:01] for me he says I've been a young man and
[55:04] now I'm old now I've never seen the
[55:05] righteous for forsaken or seeking
[55:08] bread so God knows that he's going to
[55:11] use my life to testify you young people
[55:13] that no matter how dark a situation is
[55:16] don't you worry God will not forsake his
[55:18] righteous never I've never since I've
[55:22] been in this message never once has God
[55:23] failed me four months four months months
[55:26] I've got witnesses here of not one
[55:29] single sin coming into my bank account
[55:31] where where all our work just stopped
[55:33] and dried
[55:35] out not a single
[55:38] sin and you sit there as a as a dad
[55:41] looking at your children you're sitting
[55:42] there as a father for your for your wife
[55:44] as a husband you know and a father and
[55:47] you're thinking man how did I get this
[55:51] wrong but you know what you do in those
[55:54] times you open this word up say Lord you
[55:58] put me in this place you got the
[56:01] answers you've put me in this place and
[56:03] it's a hard place and it's a place with
[56:06] you could see it's affecting me it's
[56:07] affecting my parents in South Africa
[56:09] it's affects
[56:10] everyone why have you brought me here
[56:12] Lord you know how many times have
[56:14] brother Isaac stood here in front and
[56:16] said man the devil just hates me he just
[56:18] wants to kill
[56:20] me that that just just makes it every
[56:24] time but you know what's the nice thing
[56:25] about brother Isaac he's tenacious he's
[56:28] like L Jack Russell he go bring it on
[56:31] and I look at that man I go man if it
[56:33] works for Isaac it works for me and
[56:35] guess what that testimony was at a time
[56:37] where I needed it to work for
[56:41] me I will not see the righteous
[56:45] forsaken God don't run his business like
[56:47] that there's nothing new and there's
[56:50] nothing that surprises our God he's
[56:52] powerful he's
[56:53] Almighty Hallelujah
[56:57] I'll finish with this because it's just
[56:58] a pre
[57:04] meeting he says but the salvation of the
[57:07] righteous is of the Lord and he gives
[57:10] him strength in the time of
[57:12] trouble and the Lord shall help them and
[57:14] deliver them and he shall deliver them
[57:16] from the wicked and he shall save them
[57:18] because they trust in
[57:22] him who made this
[57:25] promise who told you your children are
[57:27] coming who said that you are healed who
[57:31] said the situation you're right in now
[57:33] is
[57:34] hopeless who says I will help
[57:37] you who says don't worry about it then
[57:41] don't worry about it you know what all
[57:44] four months of worrying helped me only
[57:46] gave me more gray
[57:48] hair it did you man good until I
[57:53] realized I had to take my hands off it
[57:56] then God started doing the work in my
