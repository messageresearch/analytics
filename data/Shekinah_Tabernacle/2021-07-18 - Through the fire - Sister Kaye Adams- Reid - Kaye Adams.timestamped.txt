[0:00] thank you my brother got to stay
[0:03] tuned
[0:04] [Music]
[0:15] so many times i've questioned
[0:21] certain circumstances
[0:25] or things i could not
[0:30] i mean understand
[0:33] [Music]
[0:36] many times in trials
[0:40] weakness bless my vision my frustration
[0:45] gets so out of hand
[0:49] [Music]
[0:51] it's then i am reminded
[0:57] i've never been forsaken
[0:59] [Music]
[1:02] i've never had to stand the test alone
[1:11] as i look at all the victories
[1:15] the spirit rises up in me
[1:19] through the fire my weakness
[1:22] is made strong
[1:27] [Music]
[1:29] oh he never promised
[1:33] that the cross would not get heavy on
[1:38] the hill
[1:39] would not be hard
[1:42] to climb
[1:43] [Music]
[1:47] he never offered
[1:50] victory without fighting but he's had
[1:55] help with always come
[1:58] in time
[2:02] just remember when you're standing
[2:06] in the valley of decision
[2:11] and the adversary says
[2:16] or giving
[2:20] but just hold on
[2:25] [Music]
[2:27] our lord will show up
[2:33] and he will take you
[2:36] through the fire
[2:40] again
[2:44] [Music]
[2:47] so when the load gets heavy
[2:52] and darkness does surround me
[2:55] and the devil whispers you are
[2:59] on your own
[3:03] i turn my eyes to jesus
[3:06] [Music]
[3:08] pour my heart out to him
[3:11] and he whispers he whispers to me you
[3:15] are not alone
[3:25] it's then i am reminded
[3:27] [Music]
[3:31] i've never been forsaken
[3:34] never ever been forsaken
[3:40] jesus always turns
[3:43] up right on time
[3:48] as i look at all the past victories
[3:54] and the spirit rises up in me
[4:00] i know that all god's promises
[4:04] his promises have been lost
[4:10] to me
[4:15] well he never promised
[4:20] that the cross would not get heavy
[4:24] all the health would not be hard to
[4:29] climb
[4:33] he never offers
[4:37] victory without fighting
[4:41] he said help will
[4:45] always come
[4:48] in time
[4:52] so remember when you're standing
[4:56] in that valley of decision and the
[5:01] adversary says
[5:04] giving
[5:08] just hold on
[5:11] [Music]
[5:13] our lord will show up
[5:18] and he will take you
[5:21] through the fire
[5:25] once again
