[4:40] [Applause]
[4:48] [Music]
[4:51] great
[7:01] amen how could we not be happy everyday
[7:05] amen
[7:06] makes me think of this song victory
[7:11] victory is mine
[7:21] and
[7:23] in
[7:47] [Music]
[7:52] that's the medley of victory is mine and
[7:54] in the name of Jesus
[7:56] so we'll try it again they start with
[7:57] that victory
[7:59] [Music]
[8:23] rather Devi we've got the song right he
[8:25] just follow it down
[8:26] it's the melee so just keep going down
[8:29] we've got the chorus we'll do this again
[8:31] it's alright go on down baby so sorry I
[8:36] should have run you through this one so
[8:37] then it says the chorus for this song is
[8:39] when we stand on the name of Jesus tell
[8:42] me who can stand before because we sing
[8:44] this victory is mine in the name of
[8:46] Jesus Christ but when we stand on that
[8:49] name because you can claim your victory
[8:50] but once you stand on that word of God
[8:53] then you can really have that victory
[8:55] and then when I started singing this
[8:57] that's when the thought came down is we
[9:00] proclaim Mia feelings we proclaim we
[9:02] have all these things but we don't stand
[9:04] on that word on that precious name will
[9:07] not come to pass so this is given

[26:47] prophets I've slain him by the words of
[26:49] my mouth and thy judgments as the light
[26:53] that goeth forth for I have desired
[26:55] mercy and not sacrifice and the
[26:58] knowledge of God more than burnt
[27:00] offerings amen and we're just going to
[27:02] go to revelations chapter 3 and
[27:10] revelations 3 and in verses 14 to 22 we
[27:15] let's just read here we understand this
[27:17] speaks of the age the day an hour than
[27:19] which we live sees here and unto the
[27:22] Angel of the church so they do see ins
[27:24] write these things saith the Amen the
[27:26] faithful and true witness the beginning
[27:27] of the creation of God I know thy works
[27:30] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[27:32] would that thou wert cold or hot
[27:35] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[27:37] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[27:39] out of my mouth because our sayeth I am
[27:41] rich and increased with Goods and have
[27:43] need of nothing and knowest not that
[27:44] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[27:47] and blind and naked I counsel thee to
[27:49] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[27:52] thou mayest be rich and white raiment
[27:53] that thou mayst be clothed in it than
[27:56] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[27:58] appear and anoint thine eyes with
[28:00] eyesalve that thou mayest see and as
[28:03] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[28:06] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[28:08] stand the door and knock and If any man
[28:10] hear my voice and open the door I will
[28:12] come in to him and will sup with him and
[28:15] he with me to him that overcometh will I
[28:18] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[28:20] as I also overcame and have sit down
[28:23] with my father in his throne he that
[28:25] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[28:27] saith unto the churches I mean you may
[28:30] have your seats may the Lord bless the
[28:32] reading of his word I'd like to begin a
[28:36] beginner series on the lady of C in
[28:40] church age now there's a lot that has
[28:43] happened in this day an hour a lot of
[28:45] scripture has been fulfilled in our
[28:47] generation and I want to begin to go
[28:49] from beginning from from we understand
[28:53] the lady I see in church a started
[28:55] around 1906 with the Azusa Street
[28:57] revival God restoring the the gifts of
[29:00] the Spirit back into the church and
[29:02] there was a big wave of the Pentecostal
[29:04] movement through the earth and and this
[29:06] this began this space of time where God
[29:09] would do an incredible amount of things
[29:12] and we are living in the lady I see in
[29:13] church age we know that even after the
[29:16] brightest raptured the lady I see in
[29:17] church age will continue on because the
[29:19] world is in a lady of seeing condition
[29:21] but the bride will be taken off the
[29:23] earth so endless endless time there is a
[29:27] lot that God has fulfilled and he is
[29:30] fulfilling and I just want to go into
[29:32] these things that we would ever be I
[29:34] believe a better understanding where we
[29:36] are in the scripture and also we would
[29:38] have a better appreciation with with
[29:41] where God has taken us from and we read
[29:44] in Ephesians if you just want to follow
[29:46] me as we as we
[29:48] we're going to read in Ephesians chapter
[29:50] 1 and we're gonna read from verses 5 to
[29:54] 11 because Paul he speaks about maybe
[29:58] let's just read this I'm just gonna go
[30:00] but slow tonight because I'm going to
[30:01] basically cover a whole bunch of topics
[30:03] them as the Lord leads we'll go into
[30:05] them as maybe you know as the services
[30:08] progressed but I want you understand
[30:09] that God wants you to know where you are
[30:12] he doesn't want you to wander around and
[30:14] say maybe we're here maybe this is
[30:15] happening your God interprets his word
[30:17] by bringing it to pass just like he said
[30:20] he said a virgin shall conceive and that
[30:22] was interpreted by Mary a man being
[30:25] found with child which is Jesus just
[30:26] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and and
[30:29] she was found with child that was the
[30:30] interpretation of their prophecy in God
[30:33] and many people wonder how it's going to
[30:35] happen God brought it to pass and that's
[30:36] how he showed it was going to happen so
[30:38] it's the same thing in all the scripture
[30:40] God interpreters word by bringing it to
[30:42] pass so we see God interpreting in his
[30:45] word we can see where we are and it's
[30:48] the important thing is when God says
[30:49] this is B this is what I'm doing
[30:51] this is the scripture on fulfilling then
[30:53] therefore we don't need to wonder and
[30:55] guess we can say god this is what you're
[30:56] doing because you've declared it and so
[30:58] he says in ephesians chapter chapter 1
[31:02] we're going to read from verses 5 to 11
[31:04] I just I only really want the verse 10
[31:07] but I just like to read the book of
[31:09] Ephesians he says having predestinated
[31:10] us unto the adoption of children by
[31:13] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[31:16] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[31:17] of the glory of His grace her and Heath
[31:19] made us accepted in the beloved what a
[31:22] wonderful verse and whom we have
[31:24] redemption through his blood the
[31:25] forgiveness of sins even I mean sorry
[31:28] according to the riches of His grace
[31:30] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[31:33] all wisdom and prudence having made
[31:35] known unto us the mystery of his will
[31:37] according to his good pleasure which he
[31:40] hath purposed in himself that in the
[31:43] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[31:46] might gather together in one all things
[31:49] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[31:52] which are on earth even in him in whom
[31:55] also we have obtained an inheritance
[31:57] having predestinated being predestinated
[32:01] according to the purpose
[32:02] of him who worketh all things after the
[32:05] counsel of his own will so he says here
[32:07] in verse 11 that in the dispensation of
[32:10] the fullness of times he would gather
[32:12] all those in heaven and on the earth
[32:14] even in himself so there comes a time
[32:16] where we had a dispensation you could
[32:18] say in an Eden of you could say maybe
[32:21] innocence then there came a the you know
[32:23] the Avery you're Abraham's dispensation
[32:25] they came a dispensation of the law now
[32:27] we're living under the dispensation of
[32:29] grace but there comes a time when
[32:31] there's a dispensation of the fullness
[32:33] of times when everything comes to its
[32:35] end
[32:36] right and we're living in that season
[32:38] we're at the end of all things we're
[32:39] living in the dispensation of the
[32:41] fullness of times when God would gather
[32:43] all things in heaven and on earth to
[32:45] himself hallelujah and that's why I read
[32:47] there in hosea chapter 6 that there
[32:49] would come a time where where he he said
[32:52] that that he would gather his elect ones
[32:54] and they would live in a sight and we
[32:57] understand that this the prophecy in
[32:59] Hosea if we maybe would just turn back
[33:02] to it it's speaking of the Jews now
[33:06] there's a lot of things happen in the
[33:08] later CH church age maybe I'll just list
[33:10] them just yo just before we continue
[33:11] there's Israel comes back into its
[33:13] homeland to receive as Messiah amen
[33:16] that's a that's one thing that happens
[33:19] hell opens up and comes upon the earth
[33:21] revelations 9 that happens the mighty
[33:24] angel Christ comes down to anointest
[33:26] people to restore them back to sonship
[33:27] again amen that happens there's the
[33:30] people that take the gospel to the
[33:32] corners of the world this gospel must be
[33:35] preached into all nations in in the end
[33:37] shall come before they can happen the
[33:39] gospel has to be restored so therefore a
[33:42] ministry with the spirit of Elijah has
[33:44] to come to restore the people that has
[33:46] to happen amen
[33:48] Christ and his bride have to become one
[33:50] there's nothing that must happen in this
[33:51] endtime amen everything Adam lost has to
[33:54] be placed into man's hands again there
[33:56] has to happen
[33:57] amen the rapture has to take place amen
[34:00] the false vine has to be bound for the
[34:03] burning that has to happen the tears
[34:04] have to be bound for the burning that
[34:06] has to happen the weed has to be
[34:08] gathered into the garner which is Christ
[34:10] that has to happen I mean there's going
[34:12] to be a translation of the living Saints
[34:13] the dead in Christ have got arise
[34:15] that's got a happen in this in time amen
[34:18] you know the you know the image to the
[34:19] beast has to be manifested upon the
[34:22] earth that has to happen the mark of the
[34:24] beast has to be manifested upon the
[34:26] earth that has to happen the seal of God
[34:28] has to be manifested upon the earth that
[34:30] has to happen I mean all these things
[34:32] have to happen is you know and and
[34:35] there's more besides that but this is
[34:37] all in the season that we're living in
[34:39] Alleluia
[34:40] I mean there's got to be you know the
[34:42] son of man has to be revealed again G
[34:44] the minister of Jesus Christ has to
[34:46] repeat in the letter C in church age
[34:48] that has to happen they understand a lot
[34:50] of these things have happened I mean
[34:52] it's going to be a sick and crucifixion
[34:55] that has to happen right there's got to
[34:58] be a resurrection season that has to
[35:00] happen amen
[35:02] there's got to be a journey of the
[35:04] church from from from Egypt into their
[35:06] inheritance in the promised land I mean
[35:08] that has to happen right there's going
[35:10] to be a change in dispensation from a
[35:12] man age to an eagle age I mean that has
[35:15] to happen all these things have to
[35:16] happen in this in the season that were
[35:18] alive and God is fulfilling his
[35:20] scripture in our myths I mean a bride is
[35:23] going to be called she's going to be
[35:25] positioned at his right hand as as God
[35:28] said to Moses there's a place by me that
[35:32] has to happen where people come to their
[35:34] sonship amen so all these things have to
[35:37] happen in the end time so Hosea here we
[35:40] read this because it said now after two
[35:43] days he will revive us make us alive and
[35:46] in the third day he will raise us up and
[35:48] we shall live in a sight now this is
[35:50] speaking of the Jews this was written
[35:53] well in my chronological order whoever
[35:56] put the time in the Bible this was
[35:58] written BC 780 now a day in the Bible we
[36:02] know as a thousand years as it season
[36:04] Peter one day with God as a thousand yo
[36:07] one day with God is like a thousand
[36:08] years upon the earth I thought I don't
[36:10] get these things around the wrong way
[36:11] because I've a tendency to see but so
[36:14] this has been three days in God's time
[36:17] and the third day sees where he will
[36:19] revive us the Jews will be revived and
[36:22] we will live in a site and we understand
[36:24] from the scripture that in order for the
[36:26] Jews to come awakened again by the
[36:28] Spirit of God
[36:29] but they're going to be cool back to
[36:30] their homeland and they're living in
[36:32] their homeland I mean so this this now
[36:35] places this scripture it's already been
[36:37] fulfilled
[36:38] where people have been called and
[36:40] there's a real desire and the Jewish
[36:42] people we're more the Messiah come when
[36:45] will we rebuild the temple
[36:46] when will we remove these things be
[36:48] restored there's a genuine stir among
[36:50] them wanting this to happen and it's all
[36:53] happening that way because soon and very
[36:55] soon that's going to happen amen
[36:58] but before that happens that Gentile
[37:00] bride has taken off the sea Alleluia now
[37:05] let's read here and let's go to Matthew
[37:08] chapter 24 I'm just going to read some
[37:10] scriptures because and then we're going
[37:12] to after we read Matthew chapter 24
[37:14] we're going to go to Luke 21 Jesus is
[37:22] answering here in Luke 24 I mean sorry
[37:25] Matthew 24 he is answering some
[37:30] questions that the the the disciples
[37:35] asked three questions two and he answers
[37:41] them so in Matthew 24 verse one it says
[37:44] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[37:47] temple and his disciples came to him for
[37:50] to show him the buildings of the temple
[37:51] and that and Jesus said under the
[37:54] embassy ye not all these things verily I
[37:56] say unto you there shall not be left
[37:58] here one stone upon another that shall
[38:01] not be thrown down speaking of the
[38:03] temple and as he said upon the Mount of
[38:06] Olives the disciples came unto him
[38:08] privately saying tell us when shall
[38:10] these things be that's one question and
[38:14] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[38:16] there's a second question and at the end
[38:19] of the world they they asked him three
[38:21] questions and then from and then from
[38:23] then on he begins to answer those three
[38:25] questions and then so one part of the
[38:27] end of the world the sign of his coming
[38:30] he he if we drop down to verse 32 he
[38:33] says now learn a parable of the fig tree
[38:36] this is putting this all in time I mean
[38:39] I trust you this this would stir you up
[38:41] a little bit
[38:43] we say well I've heard this many times
[38:44] we're gonna hear it one more time it
[38:47] should mean something to you
[38:49] if God's fulfilling his word it should
[38:50] mean a lot to you he says now learn a
[38:53] parable of the fig tree when his branch
[38:56] is yet tender and putteth forth leaves
[38:58] you know that summer is nigh so likewise
[39:01] ye when you shall see all these things
[39:03] know that it is near even at the doors
[39:07] verily I say to you this generation
[39:09] shall not pass till all these things be
[39:13] fulfilled heaven and earth shall not
[39:15] pass away I mean shall pass away sorrow
[39:18] but my words shall not pass away now we
[39:22] understand we we won't read it now but
[39:25] if you go read and Jeremiah chapter 24
[39:27] Jeremiah sees a vision of two baskets of
[39:30] figs and God gives them the
[39:32] interpretation cuz one that he says is a
[39:34] basket of good figs the other one
[39:36] naughty evil figs that's what he uses
[39:39] the word not a says the good fix he says
[39:41] this is both the children of Israel the
[39:44] good figs that so they'll all be
[39:46] scattered they'll all be driven out of
[39:48] the promised land but the good folks
[39:49] will come back again but the evil figs
[39:52] will be scattered they'll never come
[39:53] back again and that and that's what
[39:56] happened there when when Nebuchadnezzar
[39:57] came he burned Jerusalem burned the
[40:00] temple did everything took them all into
[40:02] captivity and after seventy years some
[40:04] of the Jews came back but not all of
[40:06] them came back right so when he speaks
[40:08] about figs and a tree speaks of it not
[40:11] only a person but also a nation so since
[40:14] when you see a the parable of the fig
[40:16] tree this is an Israel becoming a nation
[40:18] when when you see it's putting forth its
[40:20] bud so it's beginning to grow again amen
[40:24] Israel becoming a nation again puts
[40:26] forth leaves you know that summer is
[40:29] nigh the Millennium is nigh that's why
[40:31] he's speaking about and Israel's being a
[40:33] nation for about 70 years
[40:36] Amen for over two and a half thousand
[40:38] years they haven't been a nation now
[40:40] they're a nation and if you go even look
[40:42] at the war history and the commentary on
[40:44] on the independence war in different
[40:46] ones they shouldn't have they shouldn't
[40:48] even be standing as a people but God
[40:50] wanted them there God had to have them
[40:53] there because there are signposts
[40:54] telling you we're at the
[40:56] and then I read that scripture that this
[40:58] generation this generation shall not
[41:01] pass till all these things be fulfilled
[41:02] Jesus speak of the generation that sees
[41:05] Israel became a nation shall not pass
[41:07] until all things are fulfilled and
[41:09] they've been a nation seventy years they
[41:13] are elderly now we're are we friends
[41:17] we're right at the end of the end of the
[41:18] end of the end amen so this is now
[41:21] putting this in in time where Israel has
[41:26] been gathered but then if we go to Luke
[41:28] chapter 21 we're going to read another
[41:32] record of what Jesus just see it but
[41:34] we're going to see well it's just let's
[41:36] just read it
[41:42] Luke 21 and verses 20 29 down to verse
[41:51] 33 he says here speaking of the same
[41:55] thing he says but he spake to them a
[41:57] parable behold the fig tree and all the
[42:01] trees when they shall shoot forth you
[42:04] see and know that your ownselves that
[42:06] summer is nigh is nigh at hand so
[42:09] likewise ye when you see these things
[42:12] come to pass know you that the kingdom
[42:13] of God is nigh at hand fearless and to
[42:16] you this generation shall not pass away
[42:18] till all be fulfilled heaven and earth
[42:20] shall not pass away by sorry shall
[42:23] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[42:25] words shall not pass away so he's saying
[42:28] it's not just not just Israel becoming
[42:30] coming to its fruition but all trees and
[42:33] you see all the nations rising up you
[42:36] see because it wasn't so if you go look
[42:39] at the time Israel becomes a nation
[42:41] shortly before or after that brother
[42:44] branham is called to take two gifts of
[42:46] two gifts amen a healing revival to
[42:49] strike the earth and ultimately the
[42:51] reason of his ministry is to call the
[42:52] bride to Jesus Christ and then also the
[42:54] World Council of Churches begins to race
[42:56] all in the same amount of time so God is
[42:59] calling Israel back to their homeland
[43:01] God is sending a messenger to find a
[43:03] bride for his son Jesus Christ and also
[43:06] the tears are starting to be bound all
[43:08] this
[43:09] in the same time everything is coming to
[43:11] its climax amen this is very important
[43:15] we know these things because if we get
[43:17] because you should be able to look what
[43:19] you see in the earth and what you see in
[43:21] the earth is interpreted by the
[43:22] scripture Amen you see you see in the
[43:25] Bible the world has become drunk by the
[43:29] wine of the wrath of the harlots
[43:31] fornication become drunk and and and
[43:33] I'll say this now this is just me you
[43:36] know but I watched part of the
[43:38] inauguration a parade of President Trump
[43:42] and in part of the parade they actually
[43:44] get out of the limo and they walk along
[43:47] and and all of us him and his family
[43:50] nothing is about you see them get out
[43:51] and I sawed them ourselves
[43:53] this world is drunk because if you take
[43:56] a party you just take a natural party
[43:59] you want to have the most fun you don't
[44:01] get some sober minded
[44:03] straight person you know who's you know
[44:07] can can think soundly you're not going
[44:09] to have him rubbing your party you're
[44:12] going to have a party animal run your
[44:13] party
[44:13] isn't that right you're not going to
[44:15] have someone who actually can think
[44:16] sensibly you have some crazy geiges
[44:19] that'd be more fun and this world is
[44:22] drunk this world has gone crazy brother
[44:26] ham says that this world is just this
[44:28] close to insanity and it has God and
[44:31] saying people are so drugged up to try
[44:33] and keep normal uppers down there's all
[44:35] kinds of things that try and stabilize
[44:36] their lives and you know this world has
[44:39] gone insane and we can see it because
[44:43] it's in the scripture now this world
[44:47] there has to be someone unstable either
[44:50] that side or the other side to push a
[44:52] button and it's going to fire some
[44:54] missiles and they're going to wipe out
[44:56] their enemy and then while those
[44:58] missiles are flying the other side will
[45:00] push their button and their missiles
[45:02] will wipe out the other side
[45:03] someone has to be not sensibly minded to
[45:07] do it and this is and we just look at it
[45:10] say well this is just how things are
[45:12] these days you know there were other
[45:14] people who were who were lined up for
[45:16] the Republican nomination there were
[45:19] people like being Ben Carson who to see
[45:22] day adventists you know but but he's got
[45:25] a good character he's got at least some
[45:27] kind of Christian good moral character
[45:29] they don't they don't want some good
[45:31] moral character person to be their
[45:33] president people aren't interested in
[45:35] that it used to be very important what
[45:37] kind of character do they have what kind
[45:39] of track work you're do they have they
[45:41] used to matter it doesn't matter anymore
[45:42] because the world's gone drunk
[45:44] the world's gone crazy now when all the
[45:49] trees come forth now it's also here if
[45:52] we if we go to let's go to Acts chapter
[45:57] 3 we'll read here
[46:06] I'm just going to touch kind of a lot of
[46:08] highlights though when you think about
[46:09] this there's so much Jesus's last few
[46:12] moments from the Garden of Gethsemane to
[46:16] Calvary so many prophecies were
[46:18] fulfilled just like this just like this
[46:21] rapidly scripture fulfilled very quickly
[46:24] he you know some people have in their
[46:26] minds oh we're we're far ways off
[46:29] you know it'll take ages for things to
[46:31] happen the world isn't really that bad
[46:34] the cuppy and Nick would he hasn't
[46:35] really wax full yet and it can just
[46:37] happen like this it could happen very
[46:39] rapidly you go look at the prophecies
[46:41] here's some homework students go look at
[46:45] the list of prophecies Jesus fulfilled
[46:47] in his last few moments and you'll see
[46:50] he feel fulfilled a lot of prophecy just
[46:53] in few rapidly a big amount of Scripture
[46:55] was fulfilled
[46:56] just in a few hours it can just happen
[46:59] like this and then we're done now
[47:03] another thing that must happen is there
[47:06] must be a restoration or a restitution
[47:08] of all things we read here in Acts
[47:10] chapter 3 we're going to read from verse
[47:12] 19 to 21
[47:13] it's his repent ye therefore and be
[47:15] converted that your sins may be blotted
[47:17] out when the times of refreshing shall
[47:20] come from the presence of the Lord and
[47:22] he shall send Jesus Christ which before
[47:25] was preached unto you whom the heaven
[47:28] must receive until the restitution of
[47:31] all things which God has spoken by the
[47:34] mouth of all his holy prophets
[47:36] since the world began now the word
[47:38] restitution means a restoration so
[47:41] normal for there to be a restoration
[47:42] there has to be a losing of something
[47:44] right and we know from the dark ages you
[47:48] take from you take Peter Kostis or full
[47:50] the people in that you know the children
[47:52] of God in the your upper room 120 they
[47:55] are fully birth into the kingdom but
[47:57] then you come to about Acts chapter 15
[47:59] and there's disciples that have come in
[48:01] and they're trying to already swing the
[48:02] people back to become Jews before they
[48:04] become Christians so there's people
[48:06] haven't been fully born into the kingdom
[48:08] they've just they've just associated
[48:10] themselves with the believers but they
[48:13] haven't become full believers here and
[48:15] you can see already and decline from the
[48:17] day of Pentecost already it gives me to
[48:20] decline begin to happen until the Dark
[48:22] Ages where the truth has been virtually
[48:23] totally wiped out amen you can see it in
[48:27] the scripture and then but then there so
[48:30] that had to happen because it had to be
[48:33] a restoration of all things and that's
[48:36] why if we if we go to if we go to Luke I
[48:43] mean so I Matthew chapter 17 we're going
[48:47] to read about what Jesus is
[48:59] Jesus says here in Matthew 17 verse 10
[49:02] dunder we're gonna read revert down to
[49:04] verse 13 and as disciples asked him
[49:08] saying why then say the scribes that
[49:11] Elias must first come and jesus answered
[49:16] and said unto Elias
[49:17] surely shall first come and restore all
[49:19] things so he's going to come but I
[49:21] signed you that Elias has come already
[49:23] and then you have not but if that unto
[49:25] him whatsoever things they listed
[49:27] likewise shall also the Son of Man
[49:29] suffer of them then the disciples
[49:32] understood that he spake unto them of
[49:34] John the Baptist
[49:35] so Jesus saying he has come but he shall
[49:38] come it's being of two different comings
[49:41] of the spirit of Elijah and the spirit
[49:44] of Elijah was seen upon the earth to
[49:45] turn the people to God not to turn
[49:48] people to himself but to turn people to
[49:50] God amen and you even take you even take
[49:54] the account and first Kings when when
[49:56] when there are Mount Carmel this is this
[49:58] is Elijah fear and he rebuilds the altar
[50:01] of God that had fallen down so he ruber
[50:03] rebuilds the correct approach to God and
[50:06] he places the wood and the sacrifice and
[50:08] as the water poured on in the praise Oh
[50:10] Lord that the people would know that
[50:13] thou art God I've done this according to
[50:15] thy word and you have turned their
[50:17] hearts back again amen and in the fire
[50:20] false and the people see who really is
[50:22] God that was the that's the purpose of
[50:24] his ministry that the people by a
[50:26] supernatural vindication would turn the
[50:28] people a meant back to the original
[50:30] faith Allu yeah I'm glad that's the case
[50:34] it means there has to be he shall come
[50:36] and restore all things we read so this
[50:39] had to happen in this day as well I'm
[50:43] glad that's true I mean in also what we
[50:46] have now you say well what does this
[50:49] really got to do with me well I'm gonna
[50:51] show you this is a harvest season it's a
[50:54] harvest and they dosia right they did in
[50:56] Christ are waiting for us to be gathered
[50:59] I mean because us without them cannot be
[51:02] made perfect it says in Hebrews 11 which
[51:04] means means complete so they're waiting
[51:07] for us to come to our position amen and
[51:09] then they will race and then our bodies
[51:11] will be changed it will
[51:12] go to meet the Lord in the air so that
[51:15] there's a harvest so we've been gathered
[51:18] to a place even right now
[51:20] we've been gathered to a place a mint
[51:23] who's heard always get his first name
[51:26] wrong but who's heard of brother Robert
[51:28] or brother Richard Milligan's testimony
[51:30] whose watch that California Lincoln sent
[51:33] it to you he was one of Billy Graham's
[51:35] managers I mean not not sorry not Billy
[51:38] Graham Benny Hinn's managers and he was
[51:40] zero on the platform with Benny Hinn and
[51:42] he saw the people that your people being
[51:44] pushed over and God you know the spirit
[51:46] doing different things and he even was
[51:49] partaker of that he was in one one
[51:51] meeting he says and Benny Hinn says I've
[51:53] got to go you take over and then he did
[51:56] it and they all fell over totally and he
[51:58] said I got it I got it
[51:59] but he found out he didn't have it and
[52:00] then he comes across one of his friends
[52:04] came into the message but he hadn't been
[52:06] converted yet and his friend had like a
[52:08] fight he picked him up and pinned him
[52:09] against the wall saying you've got to
[52:11] grow up spiritually and then so they
[52:14] never spoke for about seven years then
[52:16] he meet him again he had been changed
[52:17] because he was just talking about
[52:19] doctrine but the life had come unto Him
[52:21] him and his wife have been transformed
[52:22] by this message and then so he begin to
[52:25] he got the your the seven church age
[52:27] book and different things and he was
[52:29] reading in there where brother BAM says
[52:31] about the tears are being bound which is
[52:34] the World Council of Churches all the
[52:35] denominations are being bound and then
[52:37] he's about to go into this meeting which
[52:39] was the first International pastors
[52:42] meeting that they had ever had and and
[52:45] he comes late into a service and and a
[52:48] man is preaching about basically we're
[52:49] not looking for God to come back we just
[52:51] got a fight and live and everything
[52:53] we're not looking for Jesus Christ's
[52:55] return and there's thousands of pastors
[52:57] and they're rejoicing and they're
[52:59] shouting and he's thinking what is this
[53:01] and then his ears like go deaf so he
[53:04] sees the people they're sharing
[53:06] rejoicing but all the noise goes and
[53:07] then a voice speaks to him because he's
[53:09] asking what is this and the voice speaks
[53:11] and says this is what you read in the
[53:14] church age book by my prophet ah this is
[53:17] the rope that is binding the tears and
[53:19] you better get out of here
[53:21] at least you be bound as well and he ran
[53:23] to his car and he fled the place
[53:27] there's a binding you we are being
[53:31] gathered I want to make this personal
[53:33] you say this is not just an idea and a
[53:35] doctrine yes
[53:36] no will being gathered to a place and a
[53:39] spirit is gathering you right you're
[53:42] either being gathered amen to the Ghana
[53:44] which is Christ there's a harvest going
[53:46] on or you've been gathered to the
[53:48] burning I know it's awful strong but
[53:51] there's elders brother Brahim says just
[53:53] just just one statement oh wait I want
[53:55] to you know show it to you as well
[53:57] brother Brahim says and I think it's
[53:59] ashamed of him he says the spirit of
[54:01] rock and roll will lead them to the
[54:04] Battle of Armageddon
[54:05] and you can see it upon the earth just
[54:08] one statement but you can see it see a
[54:10] prophet can just make it behold the
[54:11] virgin shall conceive and it happened
[54:13] just one statement amen you know but you
[54:17] see it and B you see it manifesting upon
[54:19] the earth he had a vision 1933 you know
[54:21] Hitler would rise up and the you know
[54:23] World War two and different things and
[54:25] you know I remember watching a
[54:27] documentary on world war two it's just
[54:28] real footage from the war and and it's
[54:31] the Normandy landings and there's all
[54:34] these and and here comes the Allied
[54:36] fleet across the channel who seen these
[54:38] things and there's all these there's
[54:40] this big armada and thousands of men and
[54:43] planes in the air and planning and
[54:45] weapons all different things and it's
[54:48] all because one man said something
[54:51] Hitler will rise in Germany amen
[54:55] you know World War two is going to
[54:57] happen but it'll come to a mysterious in
[54:59] it's just a phrase but look at it
[55:01] manifest upon the earth it was you just
[55:04] take even we say well I'm not sure about
[55:06] that you take God telling Abraham your
[55:09] seed will sojourn in a strange land for
[55:11] hundred years but I'll bring them out
[55:13] with a mighty hand and then if you could
[55:15] have a you know aerial view of that he
[55:18] comes a million odd people his Moses
[55:20] come down into Egypt I mean let my
[55:22] people go the plagues fall all those
[55:24] things happen and then God and then God
[55:27] draws them out of Egypt it's just a
[55:29] phrase the prophecy was just a phrase
[55:31] but look at it happen look at the
[55:34] manifestation of that prophecy Alleluia
[55:37] I mean so there's a gathering going on
[55:40] this
[55:40] have a season that we're living in and
[55:42] we will be gathered we will be harvested
[55:45] or gathered in one place or the other
[55:48] hallelujah and the garner that we should
[55:50] be gathered to us Christ is only one
[55:52] Garner is one cheap fault amen so now
[55:56] let's read to let's go to mark chapter 4
[56:10] it should I say well brother Brown told
[56:17] someone their address what's wrong with
[56:20] them where they're from and it was true
[56:23] and it was true and it was true and it
[56:25] was true I'd say what he said by other
[56:28] things are true also when he saw the
[56:30] preview of the bride you know when he
[56:32] saw that preview of that bride coming it
[56:34] saw the first age walking a robed in the
[56:37] righteousness of Christ robed in white
[56:40] walking in line and then he saw the
[56:42] different nationalities come forth after
[56:44] that he saw the modern church dancing
[56:47] twisting to the sound of rock and roll
[56:49] being led by a witch and and now the
[56:54] first church that came the ones who
[56:56] you're the real believers in the
[56:58] beginning they came to a place and they
[57:00] started walking up but this modern
[57:03] church was being led by which dancing
[57:05] the rock'n'roll started going down and
[57:07] then now and then he was so ashamed of
[57:10] himself singing it's just the best I can
[57:12] do he says but then but then another
[57:14] group came up they looked exactly like
[57:16] the first ones and now seeing onward
[57:19] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[57:21] and he saw them coming and then they
[57:24] started to walk up also but some at the
[57:27] end who were who were dressed like
[57:30] Europeans started looking at these other
[57:33] ones and they were getting out of step
[57:34] and the problem was so should I be here
[57:37] screaming stay in line stay in line
[57:39] because they so gripped by it now you
[57:42] take that modern Church being led by a
[57:45] witch dancing to rock and roll now
[57:48] unfortunately that is happening
[57:49] unfortunately we don't rejoice in these
[57:53] things because they're so
[57:54] they're also but they are going to a
[57:57] place but I trust we're not influenced
[58:00] by them because we'll get our eyes off
[58:02] staying in line with the walking to the
[58:04] beat of the gospel I want to walk up I
[58:07] don't want to walk down Jesus didn't die
[58:10] that I'd walk down he wants me to march
[58:11] up and desire
[58:14] amen so now Matthew sorry
[58:18] we're in mark chapter forward we mark
[58:28] chapter 426 and he says and he said so
[58:38] is the kingdom of God as if a man should
[58:41] cast seed into the ground and should
[58:45] sleep and rise night and day in the seed
[58:47] should spring up a spring and grow up he
[58:49] knoweth not how for the earth bringeth
[58:52] forth fruit of herself first the blade
[58:54] then the year after that the full corn
[58:59] in the year but when the fruit is
[59:01] brought forth immediately he putteth in
[59:04] the sickle because the harvest has come
[59:06] now I want you to notice now there's
[59:09] four stages he speaks about that brother
[59:12] Brown speaks about the restoration of
[59:14] the bride tree he talks about that the
[59:18] early church was the grain but then
[59:22] under martyrdom and under false doctrine
[59:24] of the the pale horse ride I mean the
[59:26] white horse rider riding forth I mean it
[59:28] was buried and in the dark ad that was
[59:30] underground but God said I will restore
[59:33] and then so Luther came forth with the
[59:35] just shall live by faith
[59:37] Alleluia and even if he take if you take
[59:40] church history the the messenger to to
[59:43] the Dark Age the theit our age was was
[59:45] Columba and he found in a Bible school
[59:49] which for the next nine hundred years
[59:51] was from that Bible school up in
[59:53] Scotland was the vast majority of the
[59:55] evangelical work through the Dark Ages
[59:57] and brother Brahim says that the at the
[1:00:00] ministry that are fix th the most is the
[1:00:02] start of the age oh I'll put this in
[1:00:04] I'll bring this out later but his
[1:00:07] ministry affected
[1:00:08] cages the most and then from him him
[1:00:10] came John Wycliff who knows Bible
[1:00:12] history he just had a burden that the
[1:00:15] Bible should be in English and then but
[1:00:18] then he was persecuted against and then
[1:00:20] he influenced us who is a hundred years
[1:00:23] before Luther and he prophesied that in
[1:00:26] a hundred years
[1:00:27] a man will stand up with the same belief
[1:00:29] and you will not destroy him and they
[1:00:31] burn us at the stake then a hundred
[1:00:33] years after HUS Luther rose up and he
[1:00:34] wasn't killed and the Reformation was
[1:00:37] born I mean so so it was buried and then
[1:00:41] now and then it brought forth weight
[1:00:46] should sleep that the siege of spring up
[1:00:49] north before the earth bringeth forth
[1:00:50] fruit of herself first the blade
[1:00:53] justification this is the restoration
[1:00:55] amen you see if he taking it take a
[1:00:57] piece of corn and you plant it in the
[1:00:59] ground when the first your green sprig
[1:01:02] go the first blade comes forth it
[1:01:04] doesn't look like the corn but it's got
[1:01:06] the life of the corn right but it's on
[1:01:08] its way but the same life that was in
[1:01:10] the corn is coming forth and as the Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost has been working through seven
[1:01:15] church ages right
[1:01:17] he's been there in the dark ages he was
[1:01:19] there in the Reformation he was doing
[1:01:21] the restoration of the gifts he was
[1:01:23] there with John Wesley he was there with
[1:01:25] Martin Luther he was there with Iranians
[1:01:27] he's there in this day as a sense and
[1:01:30] revelations chapter one he walks among
[1:01:32] the seven golden candlesticks through
[1:01:34] the seven church ages hallelujah I'm
[1:01:36] glad he's walking I'm glad he's still
[1:01:39] walking hallelujah he's walking you and
[1:01:42] me where is he he's in his children amen
[1:01:45] so first comes forth the blade and then
[1:01:49] the air what's that there so the first
[1:01:51] was the jaw shall live by faith God's
[1:01:53] restoring Martin Luther if if he saw his
[1:01:57] life you'd say well he's nothing like
[1:01:59] Pentecost
[1:02:00] but God was restoring that was the first
[1:02:03] work of grace amen and then after that
[1:02:06] was the then the ear so so John Wesley
[1:02:11] he heard the commentary that Martin
[1:02:14] Luther wrote on the book of Romans and
[1:02:15] he said his heart was warped you know
[1:02:19] these things I know
[1:02:21] read history we do not follow cunningly
[1:02:24] devised fables of men this is not
[1:02:28] cunningly devised fables this message
[1:02:30] this is God saying this is where I've
[1:02:32] been this is where I am and this is
[1:02:34] where you're coming with me because he's
[1:02:37] going to go up into the millennium but
[1:02:38] he's going to take us with a minute so I
[1:02:41] see it this is where you're coming with
[1:02:42] me but he wants you to know this is
[1:02:44] where I'd be this is where I am that
[1:02:46] gives you stability because if you know
[1:02:48] where you've been know where you are
[1:02:49] then you can say well now I know where
[1:02:51] I'm going it's like if you had a map and
[1:02:53] you say well I need to drive to I need
[1:02:55] to drive to Gisborne and you've got an
[1:02:58] old-fashioned map
[1:02:59] well first you to find out where are you
[1:03:01] on that map because if you don't know
[1:03:03] where you are you say well I've got to
[1:03:04] turn left here and you can end up in New
[1:03:06] Plymouth the opposite side of the island
[1:03:08] you got to get better you got to go back
[1:03:10] now where am I
[1:03:11] that's right and this is this is a road
[1:03:13] map this is a map God has to show you
[1:03:15] this is where you are this is your
[1:03:17] destination this is how far you've got
[1:03:19] to walk to get there but if you don't
[1:03:21] know your starting place you know you'll
[1:03:24] turn left instead of turning right we
[1:03:26] want to turn right all right
[1:03:29] okay so then now there's the plate and
[1:03:31] it is the year which is John Wesley
[1:03:35] sanctification so justified by faith and
[1:03:38] there's a sanctifying grace of Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ living a holy life amen and then
[1:03:43] after that the full ear of corn we know
[1:03:45] that in 1906 there it was small
[1:03:47] outpourings before it but then God put
[1:03:49] out a spirit on the Azusa Street mission
[1:03:52] they had a burn they want to see God
[1:03:53] restore the gifts of the Spirit and
[1:03:54] people begin to speak in tongues and
[1:03:56] prophesy and and and that spread from
[1:03:59] there all over the earth but that's not
[1:04:03] the end that's not the end right so the
[1:04:07] in the air but after that the full ear
[1:04:09] of corn that's the four stages
[1:04:11] you see Jesus speaks about the kingdom
[1:04:14] of God is like and unto this and then
[1:04:17] now that's why just an anointing of a
[1:04:19] gift now that wasn't the final
[1:04:21] restoration but after that now God would
[1:04:23] come and dwell in his people once again
[1:04:25] but he doesn't do away with anything God
[1:04:28] adds to God doesn't take away he adds
[1:04:30] like the statue of the perfect man at
[1:04:33] your faith virtue
[1:04:35] knowledge temperance all of us as EDD so
[1:04:38] so with us doubt we don't take away from
[1:04:40] being justified by faith I mean we
[1:04:42] believe in the fullest of the justified
[1:04:44] by faith you never did it in the first
[1:04:46] place you're justified you never did in
[1:04:47] God's mind when he saw you rejoicing on
[1:04:50] streets of gold redeemed that's in the
[1:04:52] first place in his mind we are merely
[1:04:54] the manifestation of his thoughts only
[1:04:57] that's why you've got to begin to think
[1:04:59] what did you think about me God because
[1:05:01] I want to think about me like you think
[1:05:02] about me because that's what matters
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:06] and then now but then we believe in the
[1:05:08] second work of grace which is
[1:05:09] sanctification but it's not us because
[1:05:11] the Methodists they had a method of
[1:05:13] living a sanctified life that's why they
[1:05:16] were called Methodists they had a method
[1:05:18] this is what you got to do but real
[1:05:19] sanctification is he comes in and he
[1:05:22] cleanses you out just like a dove a dove
[1:05:25] doesn't have to take a bath it's a
[1:05:26] special bird because the oil that's in
[1:05:29] it as excreted through its skin and
[1:05:32] keeps it clean hello heavenly doves how
[1:05:36] are you that's why there's got to be a
[1:05:38] oil in you there's going to be alive in
[1:05:40] you that produces an oil that cleans you
[1:05:42] out all the time hallelujah wherever you
[1:05:45] are there's oil coming out keeping you
[1:05:47] clean cleansing you from the world I'm
[1:05:50] glad that's true amen and then there's
[1:05:54] the restoration of the gifts we believe
[1:05:55] in the gifts hallelu we do we haven't
[1:05:59] done away with those things God adds if
[1:06:01] God adds I'm going to add I want to be
[1:06:05] in tune with him right but then now we
[1:06:07] have the full ear of corn so you see so
[1:06:09] they saw we've had now is the full ear
[1:06:11] of corn I mean after that the fully of
[1:06:13] corn the end but when the fruit is
[1:06:15] brought forth now the fruit is what was
[1:06:18] buried there has now been produced just
[1:06:21] like Jesus said when the I think as the
[1:06:23] Greeks came to him said sirs we would
[1:06:25] see Jesus you know I said to the
[1:06:27] disciples and they came and saw Jesus
[1:06:28] said now if a corn of wheat abides a
[1:06:30] lawyer doesn't die to buy his own but if
[1:06:32] it goes into the ground it comes forth
[1:06:34] brings forth much fruit
[1:06:35] that's like Jesus Christ the fullness
[1:06:37] that God here boldly was buried rose
[1:06:39] again and it wasn't just now him now but
[1:06:42] it was he brought forth much fruit
[1:06:43] started with 120 in upper room then
[1:06:46] spread forth like wildfire
[1:06:48] hallelujah amen so now we've come to a
[1:06:52] time where the same what you see in the
[1:06:56] book of Acts now is what you see today
[1:06:58] and that's why and you can stand and I
[1:07:02] want to go into it more detail but if
[1:07:04] you can understand the the Ministry of
[1:07:07] Moses and the Ministry of Joshua have
[1:07:10] been repeated again in this day the
[1:07:13] Ministry of the son of man we know we're
[1:07:15] not going to read it but well we can
[1:07:18] let's go to Luke chapter 17 this will be
[1:07:21] the last Scripture we'll read but I you
[1:07:23] know if we can just see if we can just
[1:07:27] look into the scripture and see what's
[1:07:30] happening among believers happening in
[1:07:33] the world happening you know it gives us
[1:07:36] stability because history just repeats
[1:07:39] itself history just repeats itself so
[1:07:42] what you read now let's just before I
[1:07:45] get here to myself let's read Luke 17
[1:07:47] and moved from verse 26 he says and as
[1:07:53] it was in the days of Noah
[1:07:55] knowing Noah so shall it be also in the
[1:07:58] days of the Son of Man they did eat they
[1:07:59] drank they married wives they were given
[1:08:02] in marriage until the day that Noah
[1:08:04] entered into the ark and the flood came
[1:08:06] and destroyed them all likewise also was
[1:08:08] in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:08:10] drank they bought they sold they planted
[1:08:12] they builded but the same day that lot
[1:08:14] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:08:16] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:08:19] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:08:21] when the Son of Man is revealed the son
[1:08:25] of man is Jesus Christ when he has made
[1:08:27] known again this is how the earth is
[1:08:29] going to be so the Ministry of Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ has been repeated again in this
[1:08:33] day but you have to look at now if
[1:08:35] there's been the ministry if Elijah's
[1:08:37] come then there's been the Ministry of
[1:08:39] the Son of Man then now there's been a
[1:08:41] real Pentecost
[1:08:43] we've been restored back to not back to
[1:08:46] Azusa Street Pentecost but back to the
[1:08:48] original Pentecost because the original
[1:08:50] Pentecost was God and dwelling his
[1:08:52] people the fullness filleth all in all
[1:08:54] and the gifts everything he had we have
[1:08:56] right so but if we're restored back to
[1:09:00] them then we have a book of Acts again
[1:09:02] but then it but then in a book of Acts
[1:09:04] you have as I said and I believe it's in
[1:09:07] about X 15 you have people coming among
[1:09:10] the believers who are not fully
[1:09:11] converted and they're trying to sway
[1:09:13] people back to things of a former age
[1:09:15] and then you have the Corinthian church
[1:09:18] come forth they have their problems the
[1:09:21] Galatian Church come forth they have
[1:09:23] their problems the church in
[1:09:25] Thessalonians all those different
[1:09:29] churches and everything that the that
[1:09:31] the believers faced is repeating again
[1:09:34] today you just got to go read you see
[1:09:38] the Galatians what's happen legalism
[1:09:40] came into trying to drag the people back
[1:09:42] to a former way of doing things that's
[1:09:44] happened and we know the church in
[1:09:46] Galatia wasn't just one Church as a
[1:09:47] group so the whole part of they say the
[1:09:50] message believers had been influenced
[1:09:52] the wrong way you know these things
[1:09:56] happen you see this that's been
[1:09:59] repeating it you see the Corinthian
[1:10:01] church believers fill with the spirit
[1:10:03] but they're mature not only a place
[1:10:06] everyone has a song or a you know a
[1:10:08] psalm or a word or a tongue or whatever
[1:10:09] it is it's just confusion and there's
[1:10:12] sin among them I mean they turn liberal
[1:10:14] and they didn't deal with it you see
[1:10:17] that around the Ephesian Church deep
[1:10:21] teaching but then Paul has to come and
[1:10:23] say husbands love your wives wives love
[1:10:25] your husband's they forgot about the
[1:10:28] family dynamic you see that repeating
[1:10:31] you see you know I believe it's in
[1:10:34] second Thessalonians let's just read it
[1:10:36] real quick but um or maybe no maybe it's
[1:10:41] not no it's not actually what I want but
[1:10:46] we'll read it anyway
[1:10:53] but there's one part where people are
[1:10:55] already going around preaching that the
[1:10:56] resurrection has come the resurrections
[1:11:00] come already you see that around people
[1:11:02] believe we're in the millennium and the
[1:11:03] rapture is already taking place and it's
[1:11:04] all done whilst at the resurrection
[1:11:06] that's repeated what you see in the
[1:11:11] beginning you see at the end amen now
[1:11:14] second Thessalonians now we beseech you
[1:11:21] brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:11:24] Christ as the second Thessalonians 2 and
[1:11:26] 1 now we beseech you brethren by the
[1:11:28] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[1:11:30] our gathering together unto him that ye
[1:11:33] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[1:11:36] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[1:11:39] nor by letter as from us as that the day
[1:11:44] of Christ is at hand let no man deceive
[1:11:47] you by any means for that day shall not
[1:11:49] come except there come a falling away
[1:11:50] first and that son of that man of sin be
[1:11:53] revealed the son of perdition who
[1:11:56] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[1:11:58] that's called God or that is worshipped
[1:12:00] so that he as God sitteth in the temple
[1:12:02] of God showing himself that He is God
[1:12:04] remember ye not that when I was yet with
[1:12:07] you I told you these things and now you
[1:12:10] know what withholdeth that he might be
[1:12:13] revealed in his time for the mystery of
[1:12:15] iniquity doth already work only he who
[1:12:17] now letteth will let until he be taken
[1:12:20] out of the way and then shall that
[1:12:22] wicked shall that wicked be revealed
[1:12:24] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:12:27] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:12:28] with the brightness of his coming even
[1:12:31] him whose coming is after the working of
[1:12:33] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:12:36] wonders I mean we'll just leave that
[1:12:39] there but is that people can get shaken
[1:12:43] and mind spirit trouble by different
[1:12:45] things floating around don't be troubled
[1:12:46] look into the scripture what has to come
[1:12:48] to pass I meant and so we're just going
[1:12:53] to leave it there for tonight but
[1:12:55] there's many things that are being
[1:12:56] fulfilled and I want to show you in the
[1:12:58] scripture if you honestly if we can
[1:13:01] honestly just see what the shadow is and
[1:13:03] we can see ourselves in that shadow then
[1:13:06] we won't be trouble
[1:13:07] by what you see around you and it'll
[1:13:10] give us stability in an hour walk right
[1:13:12] and so let's have we have the musicians
[1:13:15] please and that's why I say go go read
[1:13:20] because we your brother Graham says when
[1:13:22] that vine puts forth another branch they
[1:13:24] will write another book of Acts behind
[1:13:25] it and we just think of miracles and
[1:13:27] healings and wonders and all those
[1:13:29] things are here but there's also the
[1:13:31] Galatians the Ephesians the
[1:13:33] Thessalonians the Corinthians all those
[1:13:36] that was all produced in the book of
[1:13:38] Acts era right so you've got to see now
[1:13:43] people but they're all believers but
[1:13:46] they just influenced different kind of
[1:13:47] ways they meant no that's why if you can
[1:13:50] see these things we're gonna be tossed
[1:13:52] to and fro by every wind of doctrine
[1:13:54] because you're gonna give stability
[1:13:55] because you can actually see well this
[1:13:57] person's because men we're to judge
[1:13:59] righteous judgment that doesn't mean you
[1:14:01] condemn someone but you can see well
[1:14:03] this person is actually just the
[1:14:04] Galatian they're still a believer but
[1:14:07] they're just this way oh this person's
[1:14:08] are Corinthian they're still a believeth
[1:14:10] or this one's an Ephesian amen
[1:14:13] you know you can and then even you can
[1:14:15] see and then I want to go also through
[1:14:17] you take Saul and David that's repeated
[1:14:22] in the state brother Brahim said that
[1:14:24] the Pentecostal moved was the last of
[1:14:26] the man aged Saul was the Saul has been
[1:14:30] King head and shoulders above the rest
[1:14:32] look like a real king that's what man
[1:14:34] wanted this was man's wisdom coming
[1:14:36] forth this is what we think a king
[1:14:38] should be but God chose a David and they
[1:14:42] came a point now where we there's the
[1:14:44] Philistines and in this King Saul in US
[1:14:47] Army on one side and there's a stalemate
[1:14:49] but they know David has to come and that
[1:14:53] David was one who's mean to be the real
[1:14:54] King but then there's a war that goes on
[1:14:57] and you can see the same thing you can
[1:14:59] see the same thing from from 1965 you
[1:15:02] see it down to this day where there's
[1:15:05] been a war between a former age and the
[1:15:08] prison age but then you can take people
[1:15:11] who are walking in the light of the
[1:15:12] present age you take Edna's and Abner
[1:15:15] but the one who killed them who's
[1:15:17] walking with David but he kills her
[1:15:19] kills a believer from the
[1:15:21] from the former age and there's a time
[1:15:23] of peace you can see that happening too
[1:15:26] but we'll go into these things I'm just
[1:15:28] hitting some some highlights but but if
[1:15:30] you can see what's happening here you
[1:15:31] can see was repeating it should give you
[1:15:33] some stability I mean they'd stand can
