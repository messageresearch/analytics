Oh. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Good morning. You happy? We live in such a great country. Can I just let you know that like we can drive here on nice roads because this [music] country is one run well. The Lord's blessed us with a with a system that it just it runs well. We can all go out to work. Our power's on. We get everyone gets paid [music] and we can come here freely and just worship the Lord. There's no there's no restrictions whatsoever [music] that we can all meet together and worship the Lord. We're in the top echelon of the world. The the the what we [music] have. I sometimes wonder what the Lord thinks. You know, when we when I complain about my first world problems, when I when really I have I I'm we're so blessed in this country that we can [music] we can be here this morning. We can worship God. Our life works well. We have such easy lives here. And and you know, when I think about that, I think, Lord, I want to do what I can to, you know, utilize these resources you've given and bless your kingdom and just just, you know, do whatever we can for the Lord, which I know you will do as well. So, let's um let's stand. Let's [music] thank the Lord that he's for blessing us so much and and you know but he adds blessing upon blessing. So even if we have everything, he still wants to come down and and meet our hearts. You know, because it doesn't matter what part of the world you're in, doesn't matter where you are. You know, when [music] we come to the Lord with the right heart, then the living God will meet someone in this in a great country like this or in a country that doesn't work, but doesn't that that stuff doesn't matter when it comes to the human heart connecting with the Lord and the spirit of God meeting the human heart. Like you can be in a prison and meet the Lord there and often people do because they got more time to focus on God. But you know, so we we want to just lay all this stuff [music] aside this morning and and with our hearts come to before the Lord with an open heart and just let the Lord work in [music] our midst this morning. So let's just bow our heads. Lord, we thank you for the this opportunity, Lord, that we can that we know you, Lord, that you've revealed yourself to us, Lord, that we can come here and under expectation, [music] not not as not turning up as critical or as let's see what happens. But but as believers, Lord, we we've all each one of us this morning, we've all turned up as believers this morning, Lord. We believe in the Son of God. We believe you, Lord, that you that you're the great creator of the universe. That you came down, Lord. That you paid the price for our sins. That you filled us with the Holy Ghost, Lord. That you move in our mids. That you work through a a body, Lord. That you work through a five-fold ministry. That there are gifts in our midst. That we all have callings, Lord. That we are victorious in you, Lord. We're all believers this morning. So, we just pray, Lord, that you said we're two or three gathered together in your name. We believe that you said there you are in the midst, Lord. So, we know that you're going to be here with us this morning. You're going to you're going to bless us. You're going to fill each heart with your spirit. Lord, [music] that each each person here is going to leave this place more on fire for you, changed, renewed, refreshed in the Holy Ghost. Lord, that's what is going to happen today. Because where the spirit of God is, there's liberty, Lord. And when you come, there's always victory. Lord, there's always a [music] there's there's the shout of the king in the camp, Lord. It brings us so much victory. So, we just commit the service to you. Bless brother Ben as he ministers, Lord.

We're going to go to Genesis uh chapter 3 and um verses 9 to 9-15. And then we're going to Yeah, we're just going to read this here. So, Genesis 3 and 9-15 and um he's going to hear my musings basically for the week. They're coming out on a Sunday. So, um Genesis 3 and 9 um yeah 9 says this, "And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou?" And he said, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself." And he said, "Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not uh eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to uh to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the Lord God said And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent begal me, and I did eat." And the Lord God said unto the servant, "Because thou has done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field, upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust shall uh dust shall thou eat all the days of thy life. And I'll put emnity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou I mean, sorry, that it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel." Amen. So may the Lord bless the reading of his word. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. If you have a need, as always, just slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me during this day." Amen. Let us pray. Gracious Father, we thank you so much, Lord, as we have this grand opportunity to come into your presence once again. And as we've read your great eternal word, Lord, we need you to come on the scene, Lord God, to anoint your word to our hearts. May you anoint me to speak, anoint everyone to hear. May you take complete control as we know the greatest thing we, you know, the greatest gift any of us could ever have is to get ourselves out of the way that you can do what you want to do. So, Father, we all want to get ourselves out of the way today. Not just me, but all of us here that you can you can you can worship through us, Lord. You can do what you want. Touch every heart, Lord. Meet every life. Lord, both here and those who are streaming. Dear God, be our be our portion this day. We love you. We thank you for this day in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. I'd like to speak, if I could, if I could title this, uh, I'd like to speak about a victim mentality. this morning. Now, this may seem a bit negative, but we're going to go positive, okay? So, not that a victim mentality is positive, but we just need to look into I think, you know, I've been I've been kind of musing about the day and age we live in. And there is a a big a big expansion of this thought of people are victims. And it's how it it it has shaped people's thinking. It shaped how they live. It shaped uh their attitudes uh where everyone is a victim of something. And this was first shown in the Garden of Eden where where Adam begin to blame uh his wife. He actually was blaming God. That's why I put it in yellow. Uh he said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me. This is the reason I have befallen this calamity. This is why we hid ourselves, fears gripped us, sin has overtaken us. Is because it's your fault, God. you set me up to fail. And a victim mentality, as we'll read the definition soon, is always puts the puts the problem or the responsibility of the reason why things have happened on someone else. Never it never takes ownership for for what has happened. And so we can see here just from the very first time fallen man begins to speak. See, before this happened, uh Adam, Adam Adam as as as the last uh act of being a son of God, his position tried to save Eve. His first act as a fallen son of God was blaming God for why he's in this position. Is everyone following me today? I mean, so this was this was the uh so this is the first time that fallen man would have a victim mentality would would would would blame someone else for the reason they're in this state. Now I don't believe we are in this condition today but this is a spirit that's upon the world that wants to come upon you. This age of lados oair of people's rights and entitlement cuz entitlement and victim mentality is very intertwined together. This wants to get into your thinking gets into your attitudes. This anointing wants to take over your life that instead of being an overcomer meant you're a victim. You know, if I can say it, the only thing we're a victim of is God's grace and and and election, if I can put it that way. You know, not that we're victims, but you understand if what what what governs your life is really what your identity is. Okay? So now, if you're a victim, then that is your identity. You've been wronged by someone something or your forebears or whatever. Now, I'm not diminishing any of history. It happened. It was terrible. We understand that. I'm not sweeping anything under the rug, but how do we deal with it as individuals? Now, how do we how do we deal with it? Because the world wants us to deal with it in a very negative way of being a victim. &gt;&gt; We could all find something we're a victim of. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what country we're from, race, gender, whatever age, you know, even our upbringings, people will live under. They're a victim of their upbringing and they just let that thing rule them. Why not? Why not overcome that? Why not actually say, "No, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from all sin. Amen. He's the remedy to my pain. He's the remedy to my hurt. He's the remedy of my past. Why not? Why not let God take control? Now, now Google will say a victim mentality or a victim complex is a persistent mindset where someone sees themselves as a perpetual victim believing bad things always uh happen to them due to others actions or unfair circumstances, feeling helpless and avoiding personal responsibility, often stemming from trauma or defense mechanisms. It's characterized by blaming others, feeling powerless, and interpreting events negatively even when evidence suggests otherwise. That means that someone who has a victim mentality and someone who doesn't can have the same upbringing, have the same parents, have the same everything exactly the same. They can be literally twins, identical twins. One can have a victim mentality, one cannot. And and and the one with the victim mentality always look at everything negative. Oh, mom was like this, dad was like this, and this was all negative and nothing was fine. But the person who's the overcomer will look at those same circumstances, that same story, and their conclusion comes out different because they're not a victim. &gt;&gt; Now, we understand that everything everything we go through will either make us better or bitter people, right? So, pain pain, you know, the devil uses pain to try and open a door into someone's spirit. And this is where depression comes from. This is where any any kind of uh spiritual wounding can happen is when there's a trauma, something happens and then what does he do? the devil tries to get you to agree with him that he can open that door and he can step into that thing just like a complex or a pain or a hurt or you know anything people who people have a complex of their of their of their gender even you know because the devil whispers to them you're on the wrong side of the fence and you know this is not where you belong and all the negative perceived negatives you know of that gender but you know what does he do he's trying to step into a wound that shouldn't be there &gt;&gt; but it's but but but it's how you respond to his his uh his preaching, you know, do you say amen to him and say, "Yes, I'm a victim and poor me and I, you know, I don't deserve I, you know, I shouldn't have been raised in that family." God placed you in that family. God gave you certain parents because like brother Bram says, it's like when they mold a mold a bell, you know, a bell you put in a tow that you ring, right? They take certain amount of iron and different elements and he and he molds the bell. He shapes it a certain way cuz it gives a specific sound he's wanting to give, right? It's like God, he took our forebears and he ordained this one to marry this one and this one not to marry that one, but to marry this one. And it all come down because God is molding your character. He's molding your nature a certain way through your natural lineage. And he'll allow even complexes to come into your life because he wants you to be a certain way. &gt;&gt; Like brother Bram, he he actually he said he had a complex against immoral woman. &gt;&gt; God allowed him to have that complex &gt;&gt; because he had to be Elijah. His upbringing shaped him a certain way. He was a man of the wilderness. If he was an urban, spoiled rich kid, he would not have been a man of the wilderness. He would have been a man of the cafe. I don't know, whatever you want to call. Yeah. But but he would just he wouldn't touch grass, you know. He wouldn't have been out what but so his upbringing shaped him because he had to be a certain way. So God used that to bring an expression out of his life. Now it's very easy to see brother Brown that way. But what about yourself? Right? See, God has mold us. He's given us. We are not a cosmic accident. &gt;&gt; We are not by chance. You did not come here by chance. You came here by design. You g came here by election, by predestination. And how you came, the the the nation you're born in. Amen. Your parents, your socioeconomic settings, or how rich or poor you were, God allowed that because God wanted a certain nature. He wanted a certain thing. When your bell sounds that only you can ting. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm custom made. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't just come off some stamp machine factory thing. No. No. I'm custom built. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we're all custom built. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz God had a certain sound he wanted to give. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the key characteristics of a of a person with a victim mentality uh it's blaming others, attributing misfortune to external factors like partners, family or the world rather than personal choices. Lack of control, feeling helpless and believing outcomes are entirely outside their influence. Pessimism, expecting negative results and feeling constantly wronged. avoiding responsibility, deflecting accountability for mistakes or problems, seeking sympathy, sometimes driven by a need for attention or validation of their suffering. They interpret neutral events as personal attacks, resist solutions because problems reinforce their identity or worldview. This is some now this is just Google, okay? This is not me and my putting words here. This is what Google told me, okay? that this is [laughter] this is the symptoms of someone who had now this is not saying we won't have moments of feeling sorry for oursel who's had those moments let's be honest &gt;&gt; you're like why me going through this but you don't stay in that state all the time okay so so we have those moments okay we'll feel down we'll feel poor me and overwhelmed and all those things are natural but someone who has a victim mentality that's the only way they view everything you know they're like Eeyore and Winnie the Pooh they're always negative and down and life is terrible It can be the greatest day ever and it's the wor it's just just average at best. Average is the you know so but so they always look at they always blame someone for what they've gone through just like Adam did in the beginning. Now people with a victim mentality is they always look at they always look at a like they're just a victim of of their environment. Now we look at Cain. Cain was Cain's sacrifice was excellent but it was rejected by God. and and he came to a place in his life where he just blamed it was God's fault that he was rejected. &gt;&gt; You know, he's just a victim of why didn't I get a revelation? Why didn't you know, it's always an inward-looking thing, a victim mentality. It's not outward looking. It's all about self. Self is exalted and the state they find themselves in. So, Cain was Cain was not happy that that that Abel got a breakthrough. Cain was not happy that that that that Abel's sacrifice was answered. Wouldn't you just say we're back in church there? I know there's only two of them, but just imagine we're all there, you know, and you know, and and it's a prayer meeting and then so Abel's praying and God just comes down, anoints his prayer, he gets a real breakthrough, the answer comes. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't we be happy about that? You know, heaven answered a worship. Heaven responded, God responded back. This is incredible. Cain wasn't happy about this. He was upset. He's like, "Well, what about me?" Here I am. Instead of rallying around God's provider way of worship that that that Abel had the revelation for, he was offended. And then he kills, you know, he, you know, he kills um Abel and all those things. But what did he perceive himself as? A victim. This is not my fault. I'm doing this. This is totally outside of my control. And he had reasoning. He wasn't a robot. He could think. He watched it happen. He would have felt, this is just me, would have felt the presence of the Lord come and anoint Abel's life. He would have seen the response that, you know, the manifestation of when God came down and received that sacrifice. He would have heard the hallelujah. He would have seen a change in Abel's countenance. He would have seen God, you know, the victory come and he would have seen all those things. But he wasn't happy about it. And he said, well, this is just But you see, then he had to reason. Well, and then God even came to him just said flat. Just do like your brother did. It worked for him. It'll work for you because God's door's open to everyone. He doesn't close his door of mercy to anybody. It's open to everyone. No matter how bad whatever it doesn't pass doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. None of that comes into God's account. You see? And so God even said just do like your brother did. Didn't even have to Abel. I mean Cain, you don't even need to understand what's going on here. Just do like your brother did and you'll be accepted. Oh, but I'm the victim. Poor me. And this is this is your fault and this is not mine. And then he ends up murdering his brother. And what happens? He gets marked by God and leaves the presence of God. &gt;&gt; He's just a he's just a big it's like a big cosmic accident and now he's a victim. No, he planned it. &gt;&gt; He he he received God's word in his mind and rejected it and then acted accordingly. &gt;&gt; So who's the victim here? Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's not okay. But if we we can get into a victim mentality. Oh, I come to church, too. Why doesn't God bless my life? And why doesn't God do this for me? And it's not fair. And no, we should rally around answered prayer. We should rally around victory. We should celebrate it. We should c We should be the biggest cheerleader for one another. Praise the Lord. You're a victorious believer. You're going to make it. Amen. God's God's found you. I'm so thankful God answers prayer. I'm so glad I can see Calvary works. &gt;&gt; I'm happy about this. That the blood does what it says it would do. That it would cleanse the people. That the Holy Spirit of God can dwell in those people. I'm so thankful I can stand up here every Sunday and look at the effects of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So maybe I should get some pom poms. You know, you see, I'm happy about it. I'm happy about what God does. I'm not offended. I don't get annoyed or oh that's not fair. What about me? No, I'm not a victim. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe any of us are victim mentality, but it wants to try and get in somewhere because remember we're in this world, but we're not of this world. But this world wants to get into you. Right? So we we are living in Lady Oia. The world's in Lady Oia, but we're in a bride age, but we're still in this world. Right? So, we've got to be very aware that, you know, we can't let the the spirit of this age, this this victim mentality, this entitlement spirit come and rob us of our victory in Christ because it wants to. I say, you know, this is a great country. I agree, brother Isaac. Absolutely. But it is the epitome of Lady Oia. But we should take what we have and use it for the kingdom of God. Right. But this is the epitome. This this country is the epitome of Lady Oia. Everyone wants their rights and everyone's rising up and feeling entitled and victim mentality and victim of all kind of things and everyone's a victim. We aren't a victim. &gt;&gt; We are not a victim. No. If if God has found you, if this message has spoken to your life, quicken that seed on the inside, change your life. You're not a victim. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we should look at life in a different matter and say, "No, I'm not a victim. Oh, the world's falling apart. I'm just a victim of a economic collapse." No, we're not a victim of it. Just like the widow woman at Zeraphat, she was not a victim. God sent Elijah to her house and she and her son were sustained. I mean, through that whole drought, God looked after them because she looked after the word. I tell you what, you take care of the living word of God and God will sustain you. Amen. Not just spiritually, but naturally, he'll take care of you. I mean, you may have to go through some testing times, but God is just developing character in your life that you can rest in everything that's going on cuz God is using it for your good. Amen. It's not that your bank balance gets good or you get a bunch of big flash shiny things. It's that your character is developed. Amen. We're going through a developing process. So, every trial, we're not a victim of trials. No, we are the beneficiary of trials. We're the beneficiary of hardship. We're the beneficiary of trouble and anguish and trouble. We get the benefits out of it and those benefits are not complexes, pains or hurts. No, those those benefits are character &gt;&gt; or is character if that's better English. I don't know. Amen. I wish it was my second language. I can say I speak it in self-defense. But anyway, you see, we are not victims. &gt;&gt; We are not victims. Amen. Now, Cain would Kane would have this mentality. Then we then we would see here this painting is about Judas and he's and he's discussing with the high priest and so on the value of of the Lord Jesus. Now if you look at uh Judas he did not end up this way. I mean he did not sorry he ended up this way. He didn't start this way. He would have been caught up in wow the Messiah is upon the earth. This man is God in flesh and look at the miracles he's doing and look how great he is. And look I'm in the inner I'm in the inner circle man. I'm not just some guy in the back. I'm one of the 12 disciples. He called me. [snorts] I didn't join myself to him. I wasn't looking for him. He was looking for me. I mean, just like the message of the hour came looking for you. Amen. Messiah, you weren't looking for the Messiah. The Messiah was looking for you. And what he looks for, he finds and keeps. Amen. But you see now, so Judas, Judas would Judas would start off this way, but then he began to find himself in a victim mentality where the where the external where he became a victim of really misunderstanding because he came to a point in his life where he where he where he thought selling the Lord for 30 pieces of silver was greater value than keeping the Messiah. Now he would he would come to a point where he would blame the Lord Jesus and the other other disciples for for the state he found himself in. He he he felt himself he was pushed into a corner. Now a victim mentality comes there's normally underlying conditions right? There's always an underlying condition that will bring forth a victim mentality. It's never just it in itself. There's always something that it attaches itself to. Now we understand from the scripture where John would John would speak about it that that that Judas Judas was a thief. This was the underlying condition. So when he joined the Lord Jesus, he he he saw the benefits. Yes, he's the Messiah, but what can I get out of this? How can this feather my nest? How can this benefit me? And so so so Jesus now would be anointed by Mary. This is before the crucifixion and so on. And you know Judas Judas was actually uh in in other accounts you read about it. Um he is the one who says this is such a waste. He was offended at this. He thought man this this lady is spending what what a waste of time and and money cuz he says why would this o not this ointment be sold for 300 p and given to the poor. So he saw the value of what she was going to pour upon him. She did. He did not see the value of what she was doing. And even the Lord Jesus would sit there for a moment and say, "No, she's done this for my burial." Amen. So, so he actually got a revelation after, you know, while she was anointing him that that that she was anointing the Lord Jesus for the next part of his ministry. Wouldn't it be wonderful, friends, if our praise would anoint the word for the next part of what he's about to do? Amen. That that that this that you know that that our lives that we've given to him and our praise, our adoration, Amen. would anoint the living word. Amen. For what he's about to do. Well, what is he going to do next? While the dead in Christ are going to raise. I mean, before that, the prodals are coming home. I mean, God's going to God's going to fill this place. That's just my conviction. That's what I feel. I mean, but but but the wayward are going to come. You know, the hedges and highways, they're going to come out of those places. You know, this is what I'm believing for, you know. So, so why not anoint the Lord? Anoint the word for what he's about to do next. Give him praise. Amen. For it. So, but but Judas didn't see the value of what she was doing. He only saw the value in what she was wasting because he was the thief. It's interesting that it's only in the Gospel of John, that eagle anointing that um that that that actually identifies Judas being a thief. &gt;&gt; See that? See God, we can't hide anything from the Lord. He sees the underlying condition. He sees the state we're in. Right? So, now here here he is. He's offended. Uh then then then he thinks, man, this is and then he saw the rejection the Lord was, you know, cuz at first look at this young rabbi, how wonderful it is. Look what he's doing. But then he begins to reveal himself. He opens the scripture. He, you know, begins to uh preach preach the truth of the word. He saw the following of the Lord. Jesus was going down and down and down. And so he got to a point where he thought, "Man, I have joined up with the wrong cause. I am now a victim of this man's charisma, of the supernatural. I can't explain what he's doing, but I've become a victim of, you know, this man is just drawing me in. And so, what did he do now with this victim mentality? He used it to betray the Lord Jesus. Now, this is the this is the after after this because the Lord Jesus would say, "Let her alone against the day of my bearing hath she kept this." So he actually he actually corrects Judas in his thinking saying this is not a waste but this is actually a good thing he's um she has done to me. So he he got offended by this. We must never be offended by the word when it corrects our lives. We say thank you Lord Jesus. It may it may tear high strips off our back. It may skin us till there's no skin no more. Thank you Lord. Appreciate that. I you know I need that correction. Right? We must never become like Judas and be offended. And so what did he do? He began to blame the Lord Jesus for for the state he found himself in. Because if you think about uh the day he lived in in order to follow the Lord, he had to forsake everything. &gt;&gt; He wasn't allowed in the synagogues anymore. His name, he had a he had a black mark against his name. Everyone knew who he was because of his association. It wasn't like in, you know, this country you can go to this church and change to that church and there's not really a big upheaval. You're not or you're not ostracized from society because you change your church. But in that day, oh my different kind of a different kind of a culture going on. It was a big deal to say that man is the Messiah when all the religious leaders are saying he is be elabub. So he had he he he was happy to take on that reproach. But then he began to see now I'm a victim. I'm painting a picture here. Okay, as you can see, Judas came to her, but the underlying cause was he is a thief. But what happened is a a victim mentality came out. He didn't take responsibility for his choices. He began to blame. And then so right after this, right after this where where um the Lord Jesus corrects him about Mary anointing him, what does he do? Then one of the 12 called Judas of Escariat went unto the other chief priests uh sorry went unto the chief priests and said unto them, "What will you give me?" And uh that I will deliver him unto you. And they coveted with him 30 pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. You see, someone with a victim mentality is not loyal. Judas's loyalty was to money. That was his underlying condition. He was more interested in what he can get more than the Messiah fulfilling the word. So he was offended. And this is why you got to be careful. Where do offenses take you? &gt;&gt; You got to be very careful because we will offend one another. And we probably have offended each one of us, all of us equally, right? Some more than others, but we're human, &gt;&gt; you know. So, so what do we do with our offenses? Do we do we do we build a complex? Nobody likes me. I got no friends. or I'm just a victim of this my upbringing or I have to come here or whatever more or do we take those offenses to the Lord and say, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they do. They're human like me, Lord." Because we know that if we take people in before the presence of God, God can maybe begin to speak to us and tell us the reason they're that way. And once we get down after that prayer, we come down from the presence of God, we feel sorry for that person. Now, that's a quote, right? We you know we feel genuinely sorry for that person and we love them all the more because we have understanding why they are the way they are because God has shown us. Aren't you glad God can do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God can actually give us a give us an insight that we can actually have a feeling one for another instead of a push away. &gt;&gt; So this was Judas's this was Judas's um this was Judas's uh plan. Now after the betrayal, after he had betrayed the Lord Jesus and and and taken the arm men to take him in the garden, you know, he would he would take that he would take that 30 pieces of silver and he would take it he would take it back to back to them. And what did he do? He says, "I have betrayed innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? That's your problem. Are you going to take responsibility for what you've done or are you just going to see, you know, what are you going to do about this? Now, there is nowhere in the scripture that, you know, you know, before Judas hung himself where, you know, I believe if you know, I believe if Judas now hung around till Pentecost, God's mercy is great. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus called him a devil, well, there's even but he's still a human being, &gt;&gt; right? I just think God's grace is big. There's room for everybody who wants to come. &gt;&gt; There's no exclusions anywhere. Amen. This is just how I feel cuz he found me. That's just how I feel. Right? But you see Judas now, he began to blame. He says, "Well, I betrayed innocent blood. I'm a victim of a whole big misunderstanding." But he didn't take it on himself as a responsibility. He just blamed the whole condition he found himself in. He externalized the blame. We must always take responsibility for our actions. I mean, we can't blame someone else for the reason we are how we are, right? We need to very much own it for ourselves. You say, "My upbringing was terrible, but what have you done with that upbringing? Have you allowed it to make you a better person? Or has it shaped you in a very negative way and now you stay that way and now you're a victim of how you were raised?" You know, I've never seen a little kid like you go like when William was a preschool. You know, you go into the preschool or the girls, you know, you go into a preschool, you see a little toddler there, you know, hello, how are you, all happy, bubbly, you know, I don't see any kid that that's more of the victim mentality. Oh, life's not fair and this is wrong, you know. But but upbringing and time shape people a certain way, &gt;&gt; I think. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're overcomers. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to make peace with where we came from, &gt;&gt; who we are, &gt;&gt; our nature, our upbringing, how much money we have or don't have. &gt;&gt; We need to make peace with those things. Say, "God, you wanted a certain thing. You want a certain sound in my life. I'm a custommade job. I'm one of a kind. And and God, you didn't make me with any defects." Praise the Lord. I wasn't I wasn't just a you know broke the mold and they threw the mold away and they you know you know none of us are born with a disability a spiritual disability right none of us are born with that God wants to use us as we've been made a victim of our upbringing I feel to just go down this avenue because this can be it's amazing how a few years can shape a person for the rest of their life and they're still looking back with a with I think a wrong view Many times our parents were all human. &gt;&gt; If we're human, therefore they made mistakes. They said things wrong. They could have done things a better way because we're human, right? But we can't change the past. We can't be a victim of how we were raised because when the Lord Jesus comes in, he wants to give us a new identity. He wants to give us a different thinking. He wants to give us a new outlook where we can look back and say, "Lord Jesus, everything has worked for my good." &gt;&gt; Everything, even the bad things, worked for my good. Moses could stand there and say, "The time in Pharaoh's palace worked for my good." The time back side of the desert was working for my good. Those 40 years in the desert raising his father-in-law's sheep with a hightempered wife, that was working for his good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God was shaping him a certain way. God shapes us a certain way. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't have to take 80 years for God to get us into condition to speak to us, right? Amen. But we got to realize everything that's happened in life is is for our good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm going to we're going to make a shift here soon. But you see um the Lord Jesus gave us this promise. Behold, I stand the door and knock. If any man hear my voice, open the door. I will come into him and will suffer with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant it sit with me in my throne. Even also as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Now before these verses there's a there's the uh uh the lord Jesus is describing the age of ladosia which means people's rights. So this is or or um justice of the people is what ladosia means. Now what has happened is this is the condition the world is in is a lady condition. It's more than a lukewarmness. It's more than rich increase with goods. It's a feeling of entitlement and a victim mentality. Right? You look at politics. You look at you know uh identity politics any kind of way. Even even people protest over climate change. Young people do cuz they're saying that our future's been robbed from us because of the prosperity of our parents. Right? Look at look at the world's nature's falling apart. We're a victim of technology. Look at what's happened. And and what it's a victim mentality that our future's taken from us because of what's happened in the past. This is just on an environmental level. Isn't that right? There's a climate change anxiety is a real thing. It's actually a psychological disorder where young people get so anxious about nature falling apart and pollution and all these things. Now, what have they done? They've taken on a victim mentality, but it's been preached to them. It's been it's been put upon them. You're a victim of what industrial industrialization has done. And this came out very much even before the environmental issue when when when the social gospel came to the forefront. Now, I used to think the social gospel, brother Brandon speaks against it, is that the social gospel is basically just be a good person, be kind to one another. It's like a watered down gospel. And it is a watered down gospel. But a social gospel is where the pulpit's used to preach about social issues and social justice as opposed to preaching the word of God that can transform a life. I mean that's the social gospel where where whatever is trending in the world can be a trouble or injustice in just in culture. The pulpit becomes a platform to speak against those things. And so it actually dilutes or actually moves the gospel from a place where people can be born again. They can meet the living God. They can be transformed. God can change their lives to just talking about social issues. &gt;&gt; This is what the social gospel and this is what has permeated this generation from the 50s even earlier than that all the way to 2026. That's a long time. That's 86 years if my math is near close. I don't know. But you know that's a long time. That's like three generations you could have in that span easy. And so now the the pulpit has been changed to just preach about social things. &gt;&gt; But where is the true power of God? Brother Ram says the problem is it's not the politicians that are the problem. It's weak pulpits. &gt;&gt; Because if the gospel was preached in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost where actually you can be transformed where God can get a hold of your life and live in you like he did in the Bible days. Amen. Then what would that do? That would shut down every beard joint. It would remove a victim mentality. Amen. Entitlement would not be how it is today where people just want to get all that because entitlement is is is a feeling of special treatment based on gender, race, whatever it is. &gt;&gt; We aren't called to live under that entitlement. &gt;&gt; Man was never made to live with an entitlement selfish motive and attitude. All that has done is degraded people around the world. Sadly, the the social gospel has ruined people, ruined whole demographics of people. And but the thing is, we are not called to live under that. &gt;&gt; I trust you're with me today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure, we should speak about what's going on in the world, but we're not here to further some social cause. We're here to further God living in a people. As brother Bram said that his ministry was here to make powerhouses of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Statues of the living God. Amen. The full you know the full stature of God. The statue of the perfect man is a living God living in a living people. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now so so here is so this is a this is the case we find ourselves in. Now there are people in the scripture that did not have a victim mentality even though they had every reason to have it. And I'm going to start with one. To me, this is this is the greatest one is when we speak about Jonathan and Saul. Speak about Jonathan and Saul. Now, Saul Saul died sadly on the battlefield. Jonathan with him because he he had a jealousy. The underlying condition in his life, he had a jealous heart. He had an inferiority complex because the scripture says, I don't have it here, is that is that Saul was from the smallest family in the smallest tribe. But yet the Bible says that his father Kish was a mighty man of power. Amen. So but but this was and even Saul was head and shoulders above the rest of Israel. But see, he was he he allowed his his his station in life, the smallest family, the smallest tribe. Look how little I am. This is his perception that he was a victim. that he thought that God just set him up to fail. I tell you, God did not set Saul up to fail. It was it was Saul's complexes that set Saul up to fail because God even um I don't know if I have it here, but even God told him when when when Samuel came to actually tell tell uh tell Saul that the kingdom's taken from you. Samuel said to Saul, "If you just obeyed what God said to do, I would have established your kingdom forever." Amen. So So God God didn't set Saul up to fail. It was Saul's perceived victim mentality. Everyone else is at fault. Oh, the people made me worship early and the people did this and the, you know, blaming everyone else. Instead of instead of actually taking the responsibility upon himself, I am king. I have the final say. I've been anointed by God for this position. You see what did he and then so he never wanted the kingship. Now, this is after Samuel had anointed him and told him he's king. And then so Samuel gathers all the tribes of Israel to come and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. Now they're casting lots to see who's going to be king. Then finally it whittleles down to to Benjamin. Then it came to Kish. And then and and then the lots came to to Saul. But he wasn't found anywhere. What was he doing? He was hiding in the baggage. He was hiding away because he knew the whole reason for this gathering was that he would be publicly anointed king. But he was running from the very call of God. And so this would have now this is just me because I like to kind of think about how people would think here because you know the Bible characters are like you and I. So Saul Saul started off with this reluctance. I don't want to be king. You know now now what is he saying? You know he becomes this thought in his mind as he's just a victim of God. You've set me up to fail God. Look at this. It's your fault. He had a jealous heart and all these things. And so what did he do? Is he is he because of jealousy and because of because of this victim mentality that came into his life, he blamed everyone else for why God left him as opposed to taking the responsibility. Now, if he was if he was not like this, he would have been like David. He would have been a man after God's own heart. Now, there was someone in his family who was a man after God's own heart as well, &gt;&gt; and that was Jonathan. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. He He would He did not live. You think about here's a man I I don't know if I have the scripture here. I think I do. But yes. So So David I mean I mean Samuel would tell Saul, "Thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart." &gt;&gt; And and so now here is here is Jonathan. He's the He's the crown prince of Israel. By right, just by time going on long enough, he would become king of Israel. But you see what happened is because of the choices of his father, the kingdom was taken from him where he had now no chance at all to be God's anointed king of Israel. If there was someone who could have blamed others and and and developed a uh victim mentality, it would have been Jonathan. &gt;&gt; This is not my fault. that's his fault. Why do I have to be punished for something my father did and look at his choices and look at what he's done and this is all wrong and I'm just a victim and everything goes wrong for me in my life. He could have developed that but he chose not to. &gt;&gt; He chose not to develop that kind of complex. And what did he do? He actually was rejoicing knowing that his friend David would be king. And I think this is the greatest thing where where we can we can come to a point in our lives that we don't feel sorry for ourselves as God chooses someone above us that we're happy with whoever God uses. Praise God. Amen. You think about Saul a right kind of a heart. And Sam, now this is just me. If I was Saul and God told me, you can't you can't be king. I'd be okay. I'm going to set this up &gt;&gt; for when that man comes along. It's going to be easy for him. I'm going to do all I can that this kingdom can be can be a smooth transition. There's no civil war. There's no fighting among the churches. There's no fighting among the tribes. You know, I would I would set it up, wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; Because you see, God is God's plan is unfolding. And and I might be not part of the next phase of his plan, but I'm going to do all I can to build a platform that when that man arrives, he's going to be on the throne. It's going to be easy. But Saul wasn't like that cuz he had a victim mentality. This is not fair. Well is me. What about me? But Jonathan wasn't that way. Jonathan, the man who should have had a victim mentality, had integrity. Amen. He wasn't He wasn't caught up in He wasn't caught up in the the victim mentality of his father. He was his own man. Amen. And what did he do? He was he was a friend of David. and and he even saw said to so so let's just read this and David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David was in the wilderness of of Ze in a in a wood and Jonathan Saul's son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God so here's someone someone who doesn't have a victim mentality strengthens the hands of those around them I mean they want to lift up those who are going through something you see David was in a great transition where he was in the throne room he could have stepped on the throne But God had to get him out into the wilderness on the run. All kinds of trouble to develop his character. And so David's going through a great transition in his life. And what does Jonathan do? He strengthens his hands. Amen. I think this is what we should do to all of us. Amen. Those going through teen teenage years, we strengthen their hands. Those are going through menopause, we strengthen their hands. Those who at the end of their life, we strengthen their hands. Their babies, whatever age, whatever transition people are going through, we strengthen their hands in the Lord. Amen. saying, "God has ordained you to go through these things." I mean, God has allowed it. He isn't angry at you. He's not bitter. He's not He's not resentful. No, he loves you with unfailing love. And God will see you through every stage of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said unto him, "Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee, and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee, and that also Saul my father knoweth." And they too made a covenant before the Lord. And David abodeed in the wood and Jonathan went to his house. So Jonathan knew this would be the kind of the thing that was going to go on. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just trying to find where I am. See, [snorts] he had every opportunity. He had every opportunity to to to have a victim mentality. But what did he do? He said, "No, you're going to be king. I'm going to strengthen your hands. this has passed from me out of out of things completely out of my control, but you're going to be king and you're my friend and I'm gladly going to step aside to let you in. Praise the Lord. You see, Jonathan was a man after God's own heart like David. Because anyone who's a man after God's own heart wants to see the word of God go forward. And it's not out of a out of a selfish motive. They just want to see God's kingdom expand. They're not interested whether they get used or not. They just want to see God's word unfold. They just want to see people come to their position in Christ. They want to see an adopted church. Amen. That's what they want to see. Amen. So, David, David was I mean, Jonathan was like a like a like a twin to David and the fact he was a man after God's own heart. Amen. And he was he was he even, you know, he was not angry, but he was said happy that his friend was going to become king. And but someone who's a victim mentality is if they aren't number one, they get angry, they get upset. Now, I think the reason for this is because he could identify. It's amazing with Jonathan. I don't think there's any instance in the scripture says he was anointed by God, that God moved in his life. Sure, he did mighty exploits with faith. But you see, I don't think there's any instance where the anointing was upon him, but something something in his life could recognize the word in front of him. Amen. Because David was the beginning was the beginning of this scripture where where the blessing would come upon the tribes and and and and one of the blessings speaking of Judah was the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come. That speaks of the Messiah. And unto him shall the gathering of the people be. So, so Jonathan somehow knew that the kingship, could you imagine that? You've been made king. You're in the tribe of Benjamin. You know eventually the kingship's going to is going to go to another What kind of person are you going to be? Are you going to be like Saul saying, "No, this is mine and how dare anyone come and take it. I'm going to wipe out anyone who stands in my way." Or are you just going to build a foundation to make it easy? Like for example, if the rapture was going to happen in 100 years time, I'd want to make sure that every young person in this church knows God. Doesn't matter if it's going to happen tomorrow in 100 years. Amen. What we do? We're going to lay up lay up treasure of the word for our next generation. Amen. the pitfalls and things we had to go through, they don't have to repeat it. You know, why should you know people get a mentality? Well, I had to struggle, they have to struggle. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO STRUGGLE? &gt;&gt; I had to find my way by myself, therefore they have to. Why do they have to DO IT? IT'S A DIFFERENT SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Why do they have to start from scratch like we did? We should be able to like just just be a stepping stone for them to go forward with God. &gt;&gt; That's what our life should be. Amen. Because we want to see God's kingdom go forward. Why should they have to start from scratch? Oh, but I had to I had to suffer. That's a victim mentality speaking. I had to go through hardship. I had to, you know, all these things. We didn't have all this when we were started off. Yeah. God's moved on. &gt;&gt; We don't have to go back into a leaky building or a house or, you know, we don't have to go back into that because we started like that. There's another generation here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And they can take the word further. &gt;&gt; Amen. What if they see things in the word I never see? Am I going to be annoyed? No. I'll be happy. I see the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, God moving in their midst. Praise the Lord. I'm going to be happy for that. Shouldn't we be happy or should we be? No, I don't. No, that's wrong. Cuz this is this and this is not fair, God. Why do you do it for them? Why Why have you given it to them on a silver platter, God? That's not fair. Do we say it like that? No. We say, "Praise the Lord. Make it gold, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take it from a silver platter to a gold one. Give a golden spoon, Lord. Pour it in. &gt;&gt; A not trying to be jokey, but yeah, this should be our heart. &gt;&gt; We don't want them to struggle like we did. They'll have their battles. Why give them yours? Yeah, our battles were dumb. They were good, but they were dumb. Why? Why? Why pass those things on? Amen. So, what h but I think what happens is a real believer when he gets into the prince of God, he can recognize other believers. I was thinking of Mount Transfiguration. It's interesting in the scripture where, you know, nowhere does it say Peter, James, and John asked Jesus, "Who are the two men standing next to you?" But they s and they didn't have any photographs. There's no video footage of Moses and Elijah. They had no idea what they really look like. But when they're in the presence of God and they saw those two men speaking to the Lord, they realized this is Moses and Elijah, they recognize their position in the scripture. And so anyone who really comes into the presence of God, who's a gene seed of God, will recognize other people's position in the word. Amen. Like Jonathan recognized David's position that the kingdom is going to come through Judah. So it's going to come through you, David. Of course, it's according to the scripture. The the kingdom can't continue with Benjamin because the Lord said it's going to come through Judah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So So Jonathan did not have a a um victim mentality. He had an overcomer mentality. And when he died there with with his father, David would say they were they were united. They're not divided. He stood in his integrity. Amen. He was loyal to David, but he was loyal to his father at the same time. He didn't betray his father. He didn't kill his father to let David on the throne. He didn't do anything underhanded. He stood there in his integrity. Why? Because he was not he did had not have a victim mentality. He didn't feel entitled at all. He was just happy to see God take over and God take the kingdom forward using David. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyone like that has a real overcomer overcomer anointing upon them. They're actually made to be an overcomer. Amen. Like the Apostle Paul would say, "But we have this treasure in earth and vessels." I'm just going to kind of wind this up real soon. That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. We're troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. This is an overcomer. He doesn't say there's nothing wrong. Hey, we're distressed. You know, we got trouble on every side. We're perplexed, but we're not in despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken. Cast down, but not destroyed. See, a real overcomer says, "Yes, there's obstacles. Yes, there's problems, but I'm not a victim of problems. I'm not a victim of the devil's schemes. I'm an overcomer." Amen. I've been built to overcome whatever whatever comes against me. Amen. In the spiritual world, I'm here to wrestle with this thing and overcome. Praise the Lord. always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death workketh in us, but life in you. Amen. That see the Apostle Paul didn't have a victim mentality. &gt;&gt; He was an overcomer. Amen. He says, "Now thanks be unto God which always causes us to triumph in Christ." always cause a he caused us to triumph. I mean, someone who's a victim never never speaks positive. You know, look at your your thinking, your thought patterns of life. I mean, someone who's has a victim mentality always thinks negative. Someone's who's entitled always thinks negative. What about me? And it's always upon self. But someone who's an overcomer, they realize that God within them is far greater, more powerful. He, you know, they realize that God is more than able and God has allowed this to come into our lives to pro for him to prove his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he always caused us to triumph in Christ. You should put that on the fridge if you want to put something on the fridge. Always cause us to triumph. Amen. And make manifest the savior of his knowledge of by us in every place. Amen. The apostle Paul say, "For who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution, Amen. or famine or nakedness or peril or sword. See, he always looked at things in the positive way. I've been through all these things. It hasn't separated me from the love of God. It can't separate me. I've been through the I've been through the fire. I've been through the ringer and it's just proven to me nothing can separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. For it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Not just a conqueror, more than a conqueror. Amen. More than a conqueror. For I'm persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. So when he says angels there, he's not just speaking about angels in their position. He's speaking about fallen angels. He's talking about Satan and all of his demons. Amen. So he says that there is nothing in existence that can separate me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so what shall we do then? If this is how we should be, what's our mentality towards this world? I'm kind of going to going to segue back to this now. Now, when the you look at the you look at the Jewish people, you look at the Jewish people, the most persecuted group in existence is them. Everywhere they go, they've been they've been killed, forced to convert, they've been driven, they've lost everything. Are they victims? When you think of Israel, do you think of a victim mentality? &gt;&gt; You think of someone uh there are people that say, "This is who we are. We're not ashamed that we're the sons and daughters of Abraham." Amen. We this is our land and this is how we are. But they they are overcomers. They've had great obstacles. You just look at their history, you know, through the creation of the Jewish state, all these things. But they do not feel a victim mentality. No, not at all. They they have every right to say poor us and wo is us and everything's wrong and you know, no, they do not think that way. That's why they're the most successful nation in terms of technology and advancements. People say they want to boycott Israel. Well, basically boycott every part of technology that you have cuz part of it came out of there, &gt;&gt; right? But so so what did Jeremiah tell the people? Because this is this is how they begin to live. Now this is this is Jeremiah writing to the exiles that have already been taken into Babylon. He says, "Thus say the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives whom I have caused to whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon." I thought it was the Babylonians. No, God caused it. Build ye houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat the fruit of them. Take ye wives and begget sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters, that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. And seek the peace of the city, whether thou where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it, for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace." So, he didn't say, "Now, this is what you do when you go there. Feel sorry for yourselves. you're a victim of international wars and strife and politics and this is the high priest's fault and this is why you're here and have a victim mentality and you know and and then go protest and cause a bunch of trouble and feel sorry and entitled cuz you're God's people. He doesn't say that, does he? Did you read that in there? No. He said he said no. Live life, build houses, grow the community. Amen. And pray for the peace of the city where you dwell. And I was thinking about this. I thought, when was the last time I prayed for the peace of Lower Hut? I'll be honest. I don't know. That's a bad thing cuz he's giving them instructions. Pray for the peace of that city where you dwell. Amen. For the peace thereof shall be uh shall ye have peace. So, we're not victims of circumstance. They weren't victims of circumstance. God's telling them through Jeremiah, "No, build live. Don't just sit back and say, "Wo is me." And pray that the peace of God would reign where you are. Oh, in a heathen nation, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that happens in life, let's just remember this is my musings, okay? So, we're just kind of jumping a bit. Brother Ram says this, he proves all of his words. All of his words. Just think of it. All of his words. And you were his word. He was the word. and you're part of his word. And that's the reason you're sent here to confirm your place in life. Amen. So what is your place in life? An overcomer. Victorious. Going through many mighty battles, but coming out packing the victory. Amen. A surrendered, consecrated life to God as the bride of Jesus Christ. This is why trouble comes. This is why God has placed you in the darkest of ages. that God is going to prove his word. He's going to prove these words. Not your mental ability, not how not how strong you are, not how quickwitted you may be. No, that gene seed of God in your soul. He's going to prove that to you like he proved it in Abraham, like he proved it down all through the ages. He's going to prove his word. And it will confirm your place in life. Not as a victim, but as an overcomer. Not as someone who's got an entitled mentality, but an overcomer. Amen. Who's thankful, who rejoices, who's made peace with their lineage, who's made peace with their past, who's made peace with where they came from, and they say, "No, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, I can trace my family back, and I say, they're a bunch of Skellyywags. I could talk about my my my past, the Dutch East India Company and all these different things. They're a bunch of renegades, but through that I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm here. I can't answer for what they did. I can't live under some cloud of look at what they did. This is me today. &gt;&gt; And being a son of God, I'm not even part of that. God used it to bring a ting. &gt;&gt; Okay? Just like all of us. So, we can't be ashamed of where we came from. We can't allow culture and upbringing to shape us to say, "Well, I'm from this place, therefore, I'm less than someone else." There's no lesser in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; We're all equal as the bride of Jesus Christ. We're all equally valuable. Doesn't matter where we came from, our upbringing. Let's get rid of that stuff. &gt;&gt; Let's not think, "No, we're no, we're less." No, none of us are less. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, all these things come upon us that God will confirm. He wants to confirm your place in life. Praise the Lord. So, what's the summary of all this thing? Be careful for nothing, but everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Right? So, you give with prayer. So, be careful means be anxious for nothing. Okay? This is how you don't have a victim mentality. This is the answer right here. Okay? Make all your prayer and you know prayer with supplication with thanksgiving. Be thankful when you pray that your requests be made known unto God. And with that then you get the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. So if you want your spirit to be kept anxious take it to the Lord in prayer with thanksgiving. Right? And then finally brethren, now this is this is the opposite. This is the opposite of a victim mentality thought pattern. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. &gt;&gt; So, don't think on the negative. Stop the negative thinking. Think positive. &gt;&gt; Oh, but my life's falling apart. But there's a way out. &gt;&gt; It's all happened for a reason, &gt;&gt; right? David came to Ziglag. They lost all their families. The lowest point in his life was that point. What did he do? He encouraged himself in the Lord his God. God then spoke to him. What should I do? He didn't say, "Well, now I'm a victim of just circumstances and I was running for my life and God, why don't you deal with Saul and why is this so hard?" He never had that kind of thinking. He just thought, "Lord, what next?" &gt;&gt; He say, "But his life was in ruins. He lost everything." Yeah, but God can change that. &gt;&gt; And what did God say? Pursue. for you will recover all without fail. Basically, you David, you're going to get everything back. Amen. So, what did he do? He went to his men with that revelation. Brethren, we've lost it all, but we're going to get it all back. We're not victims. We're not victims of some big political move between the Philistines and Saul, the Amalachites. No, we're not victims. We're overcomers. And God is going to prove he's going to confirm our place in life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, they do. They pursued and recovered all because a victim does not pursue. They just want to hide in a cave and feel sorry for themselves. An overcomer will recognize, "Yeah, the devil's taken some things. I'm getting them back." &gt;&gt; Amen. My joy may be gone, but I'm getting it back. And my family may be gone, but I'm getting them back. Amen. God, show me how to pursue. Show me how to pursue and take the enemy's head off that I can get them all back. Oh, you can't do that. David did under the blood of bulls and goats. He did. Amen. And we may be not fighting a war with swords and spears and bows and arrows, but we're fighting a spiritual war. Amen. And we fight against spiritual powers. And we have the authority of God's word in our lives. I mean, we're living in prophecy just like David did. David was prophesied, you're going to be king. He got there. Praise the Lord. He got there. Amen. His son, he said, "Your son will build the temple." He got there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're living UNDER WE'RE LIVING UNDER PROPHECY. a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. An overcomer that's worthy to sit in the overcomer's throne. Amen. That's prophecy. We're living in that prophecy. &gt;&gt; You know, brother says the that the anointing sent in the age is the only way the believer can live. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the martyrs, they lived under an ox anointing. They could only live by that anointing. That's why they live the way they live. They gladly gave their lives. What about those under an eagle prophetic anointing that can look beyond what the five senses tell them? Look beyond what their mind even tells them is contrary to the word and they can look to the end. Just like brother Ed was preaching about being outside of time. You can look to the end by this anointing. And it doesn't mean you live as some monk who's useless in the world. No, you're useful. I mean, God gives you understanding and wisdom how to live in this world, not as a victim, but as an overcomer. There is there is many ways. There's a saying, and I'm going to use this and and and I I don't mean to sound sacrilegious, but there's many ways to skin a cat. &gt;&gt; Have you heard that saying? &gt;&gt; There's not just one way. If the first method doesn't work, try another method. There's many ways to do it. You have an objective in your heart for the word to be fulfilled. You have a longing for a prayer to be answered. Say, "God, show me how to do it." It may be a totally different approach than you think of, but God will give you the wisdom. See, David didn't always just charge into battle. He always consulted the Lord. Lord, what should I do? And God says, rise up, attack them. Next time, go back around this side, hide under the mberry trees. But when you hear the sound of a going, rise up and kill your enemy. See, God showed him what to do in every battle. It was different. &gt;&gt; What about the battles you face? &gt;&gt; God will give you the key to unlock that thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we know it's a key of faith, but God will show you how to use it. &gt;&gt; Oh, but no, everything's falling apart. I'm just a victim. We're not victims. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; I mean, this message came to identify overcomers, and it has. You are overcomers. Are you still a believer? &gt;&gt; You're still walking with the Lord. His grace is still upon your life. Amen. He's kept you all these years. You may have gone astray, but he pulled you back. Amen. He's been with you. His blood atones for you. What is that? You're an overcomer. You you have overcome another week. That's why you're here again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every day, the faith that the martyrs use to overcome the lions and the torture and the coliseum and all those things, the same faith, Brother Ram says you use every day to overcome. Just a different enemy, right? So, let's not be victims. &gt;&gt; I don't Yeah, it's easy to preach you because I'm preaching to the choir, right? The world may have a victim entitled mentality. You don't have to have it. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. We're not here to feel sorry for ourselves. We're to say, I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. I mean, I'm not a victim. I'm an overcomer. I'm sorry. Let's just have the musicians, please. Otherwise, I'm just going to keep going. But you see, never ever think, Paul, wo is me. &gt;&gt; Your world falls apart. It's like, praise the Lord, God. What do you want to show me? Hallelujah. God, you want to prove your word in my life? Oh, well that was very unexpected. Praise the Lord. What do you want to show me Lord? You want to prove yourself in this situation. Amen. So summary, victim mentality is not for a child of God. Overcomer mentality is what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:6, for to be connly minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Amen. A victim mentality is a carnal mind. It doesn't bring life, doesn't bring victory. But a spiritually minded is to be his is life and peace. And that's an overcomers mentality. Hey, the devil will tell you all kinds of things how useless, hopeless, and lost cause things may be. Don't listen to him. He doesn't know the end. He's trying to sell you a lie. Why not take God's truth and say, "Satan, that's what you think, but I don't care what you think anymore. I'm taking what God's word says about the situation." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's um let's stand shy. Let's sing that song. I'm fighting a battle. You've already won. Whatever comes my way, I have overcome. I know I'm bad. Yeah, I'm naughty. I change songs. I think, you know, I sing I know what you're doing cuz I know what you've done. Praise the Lord. Well, how do you know what he's doing? Well, I know what he's done. He's called me to be a son of God. So, what is he doing? He's molding my character in this trial. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There's peace that outlaws darkness. [singing] Hope that's in the blood. There's [music and singing] future grace that's mine today.

[music] I won't be shaken. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promises are true. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer, shall we? [music] Amen. Gracious heavenly father, as we bow our heads, we say, "Thank you, Lord. We don't need to be a victim." Hallelujah. We don't need to have an entitled spirit about us, but Lord, we want to be clothed in the humility of the Holy Ghost. Lord, as an overcomer, Lord, I believe you've made every one of us to be overcomers. Dear God, that we would not be not feel sorry for ourselves permanently. We would have some pity party spirit or anything of that way. But dear God, we would just look at every situation we're facing and say, "My God is more than able." Lord, you're more than enough. Lord, you purchased every every redemptive blessing, Lord, that you wrote in your word. You purchased for us that day on Calvary. And Father, I pray we just press forward, press the battle, knowing, dear God, that you always cause us to triumph, that we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus. Thank you, dear God. I pray you touch each one here. And Father, if that if that thought pattern ever comes near us, tries to get us to agree with it, Lord, that we're victims and everything's that way, may we resist it in the name of Jesus Christ. May it be a shock to us, those thoughts even to enter our mind. May we turn it down in Jesus Christ's name because you didn't make us that way. You made us to be overcomers. So may you bless each one here. Bless those who are streaming. Father, be with us, Lord, for the Sunday school picnic now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
