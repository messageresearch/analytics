[1:57] good evening everyone
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] hey you're doing doing good at a good
[2:05] week yeah it's good out of 10 like 11
[2:12] [Music]
[2:15] that's right we do a little thing at UM
[2:18] youth group
[2:19] you know we always start and we have to
[2:23] say one thing that we're thankful about
[2:24] just to keep a grateful attitude in our
[2:27] lives there's some quite humorous what
[2:29] their children come up with well the
[2:30] young fellas come up with that they're
[2:32] thankful for a lot of us like the boys
[2:34] are like food and sleep and all these
[2:36] things but we've got so many things to
[2:38] be thankful for in our lives and and you
[2:41] know the Lord's done so much for us
[2:43] without even doing anything more for us
[2:45] and to always have a grateful attitude
[2:48] is I mean they teach you that in a
[2:51] natural aspect of life but really in a
[2:53] spiritual aspect that's such an
[2:54] important attitude that we have to be
[2:56] grateful of everything that we have
[2:58] that's you know we are we we govern
[3:04] things by our last experience and
[3:05] something is because we have to we have
[3:08] to like put things in context do
[3:10] something else to govern if it's good or
[3:11] bad or not you know what I mean like
[3:13] like like we were doing this bit of a
[3:17] walk for a couple of days Dave and I and
[3:18] you'd carry a pack for a day and like
[3:20] man this is heaven in the next day you
[3:22] can go walking with no pick you like the
[3:23] house is so much easier but by the end
[3:26] of that that you're thinking I was is
[3:27] quite hard it's because in relation to
[3:28] the hard thing it was you know it became
[3:31] it was hard but then when you got used
[3:32] to the easier thing then it was now hard
[3:35] you know what I mean but you know I
[3:38] don't know why I said that but it's
[3:40] somehow relates to our Christian walk
[3:42] you know we we've just always got to
[3:44] have the right attitude towards our
[3:46] Christian towards God towards our
[3:48] Christian walk and always have a
[3:52] grateful attitude let's stand tonight
[3:55] and let's
[3:57] commit the service to the Lord I really
[3:58] believe that the Lord is going to work
[4:01] in a powerful way tonight who's under
[4:03] expectation let's not make this just

[4:22] poured out amongst us this evening let's
[4:25] just pull upon the gifts in and have our
[4:27] hearts ready to receive and eager to
[4:30] receive from God if we're like that then
[4:31] God will come down when their attitude
[4:33] is like that God will come he always
[4:35] comes Bruce wanted and he likes to be
[4:38] constrained you know when you're Swift
[4:39] the disciples after talking with him on
[4:41] the road to Emmaus when he got to where
[4:43] they were going he said I'm going to

[33:04] by the Lord's grace I is leading the
[33:08] message that John preached amen
[33:10] hallelujah I've been wanting to preach
[33:12] this for a long time but never really
[33:14] hit and it's never opened ups but it
[33:16] opened up this time and praise God the
[33:20] message that John preached amen
[33:22] I'll hold back let's just read the
[33:23] scriptures and then we can meet you sit
[33:25] down okay amen
[33:28] so return to John chapter 1 verse 19 you
[33:32] know this is such a lovely place to be
[33:34] this is home this is the eternal family
[33:37] you know hallelujah it's the best place
[33:40] in the hardest place to preach because
[33:43] you know everybody's so close you love
[33:45] everybody you know
[33:46] hallelujah amen John chapter 1 verse 19
[33:51] through 223 and it says here this is
[33:56] John's message coming to its climax ok
[33:59] so just let's let's just read that and
[34:02] this is the record of John when the Jews
[34:05] sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
[34:07] to ask him who are you and then who are
[34:13] you they want to know who he is
[34:15] amen and he confessed and denied not but
[34:19] confess I am NOT the Christ and they
[34:23] asked him what then are you Elijah and
[34:27] he said I am NOT he's a great revelation
[34:30] in that you know that there's only one
[34:33] record of Elijah in the Old Testament
[34:35] and they asked if he was them because
[34:39] there's no revelation of to Elijah's in
[34:42] the Old Testament until Jesus brings it
[34:44] out in the New Testament that there's
[34:46] two Elijah's two for under two comings
[34:48] but this Elijah here this is I'm not the
[34:52] one
[34:52] Malakai for and in he knows that he's
[34:55] malachi free and he knows he's in the
[34:56] spirit and power of elijah but the
[34:58] Pharisees are asking him
[35:00] are you that Elijah said no I'm not that
[35:03] Elijah he didn't say he wasn't the other
[35:06] Elijah just is he wasn't Malachi fought
[35:08] so that shows you that there is actually
[35:11] - it's on the Baptist and brother
[35:13] Branham and he says here are you that
[35:16] prophet and he says no then said they
[35:18] unto Him who are you that we may give an
[35:21] answer to them that sent us what sayest
[35:24] thou of thyself and he said I am the
[35:27] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[35:29] make straight the way of the Lord as
[35:31] said the prophet Isaiah just jump down
[35:35] to verse 29 he's here and this is the
[35:40] next day John sees Jesus coming now this
[35:42] is the climax of John's message this is
[35:45] it it's the whole thing was for this he
[35:49] prepared there was a preparation of all
[35:51] the things then this this is his message
[35:53] now this is what he came to do the next
[35:57] day John seeth Jesus coming to him and
[35:59] saith behold the lamb of God which
[36:02] taketh away the sin of the world you may
[36:06] be seen God bless his word amen this was
[36:12] the epitome of John's message this was
[36:16] the fruit of John's message this was
[36:17] what it was all for was that he would
[36:20] introduce a doctrine
[36:23] now I'm joking not adoption just
[36:25] checking to see if you were listening to
[36:29] introduce a person okay now I didn't
[36:33] introduce a spiritual being
[36:34] yet he was spiritual because the Spirit
[36:37] of God was in him but he introduced a
[36:40] person a person that would vindicate
[36:42] John's message as the ministry was
[36:45] introduced baptized and the people were
[36:48] prepared that were John's disciples
[36:50] John's you see it said that he would
[36:53] prepare the way before me so John had
[36:55] this message and it would prepare all
[36:57] the ground of the people to receive this
[36:59] person so John's message was not just
[37:03] another bunch of teaching now the
[37:05] Pharisees
[37:06] the Sadducees probably thought oh you
[37:08] know and they probably told everybody
[37:09] this guy's gone off the deep in look
[37:11] he's gone and he's teaching this thing
[37:13] and he's saying that his messages is
[37:15] going to introduce the Messiah and yeah
[37:17] and look it's all different from what
[37:20] we've been taught it's all different
[37:21] from what all the denominations are
[37:22] saying it's all different from what the
[37:24] schools of thought it's different from
[37:26] all the critical analysis of the
[37:29] Scriptures that we have analyzed for
[37:31] 4,000 years
[37:33] hmm all the priests in all the Pharisees
[37:37] and all of the learned men critically
[37:40] analyzing they can poke a pin in the
[37:42] scripture and show you what paid tell
[37:44] you what word it's on how much they knew
[37:47] that Old Testament and here's John was a
[37:50] message of men that came out of the
[37:52] wilderness under the spirit and power of
[37:53] Elijah to challenge the harlots of that
[37:56] day to challenge the spirit of Babylon
[37:58] that had creeped into the Church of that
[38:00] day and here he comes and he preaches
[38:04] these things and he what did he do he
[38:06] made all of the lofty places low and he
[38:08] brought all the low places high a man so
[38:11] he might made the humble and brought
[38:13] them up and showed them who they really
[38:14] were the people that walked about and
[38:17] goatskins and lambskins of whom the
[38:19] world was not worthy of got raised up
[38:22] into their position ready to meet the
[38:24] message of john the message of john was
[38:28] not just another teaching as much as it
[38:30] could be reduced to that by the
[38:32] religious people of that day but John's
[38:34] message was an as a person a man a
[38:39] person that actually began to continue
[38:43] and if you keep that message connected
[38:46] to John you have John's message
[38:49] this is John's message I'm going to look
[38:52] at it from that angle okay so that we
[38:53] can see a parallel with the message of
[38:56] our alum the message of today because
[38:58] the message of today is not just another
[39:00] compilation of doctrines and mysteries
[39:03] being revealed no that was just the
[39:05] preparation for something to take place
[39:08] that was the preparation for our Elisha
[39:11] amen for our Elisha to introduce his
[39:14] message his message was also a person
[39:18] John's message
[39:19] needed to pay for the sins of the whole
[39:21] world he couldn't live inside a man at
[39:23] that stage he had to actually pay he
[39:26] best way said behold the lamb of God our
[39:28] Elijah said behold the pillar of fire
[39:30] the glory of God the word of God the
[39:33] word manifested behold the manifested
[39:36] word and its fullness and he was the
[39:40] manifested word and his fullness but he
[39:42] came in a body just little lower than
[39:44] death that he may pay he came as a
[39:46] kinsman because a price had to be paid
[39:48] amen so John's message was a lamb that
[39:52] would pay the price for the whole world
[39:54] that's why he said this is the Lamb that
[39:57] taketh away the sin of the world
[40:00] now when the when John's message
[40:05] continued on and the message unfolded
[40:07] and there was all the people standing
[40:10] around and watching he he was definitely
[40:12] being observed because this was quite an
[40:14] interesting event that took place this
[40:16] was there was things happening that
[40:17] weren't usually happening and I can say
[40:20] that tonight there's things happening
[40:21] that haven't usually been happening amen
[40:24] there was things happening in 433 266
[40:27] that weren't usually happening because
[40:29] God was doing something Amen there was
[40:31] something different from the norm
[40:33] something different something higher
[40:35] because an event was taking place an
[40:37] event is taking place and the devil will
[40:40] do all he can to minimize that a net
[40:42] Rifai but it's a spiritual event it's an
[40:45] eternal event and like I prayed earlier
[40:48] the fabric between time and eternity is
[40:50] disappearing amen and you're beginning
[40:52] to see things that you never used to be
[40:55] able to see because God is taking all
[40:58] your thinking he's taking our thinking
[41:00] every time you hear sermon every time
[41:02] you say a man you're thinking is coming
[41:03] up every time that you rejoice on
[41:05] something that God speaks to you every
[41:07] time the word comes across your path and
[41:10] something as quickened your thoughts
[41:12] coming up higher eventually your
[41:14] thoughts are going to end up like God's
[41:16] thoughts hallelujah and I believe we're
[41:18] right on that road I believe that
[41:20] scripture is being fulfilled Amen that
[41:23] we shall see him as he is
[41:24] hallelujah we're in the middle of the
[41:26] greatest event that Calvary purchased
[41:29] amen everything that Calvary purchased
[41:32] as
[41:33] now coming into its full effect how God
[41:36] wanted those floodgates to open how long
[41:38] how what the Lord was so desirous to see
[41:41] as the the revelation of himself come
[41:45] out but it was steered and trapped in by
[41:48] the decrees and dogmas of men and in
[41:50] Catholicism and denominationalism and
[41:53] all of those isms and man's ideas I'll
[41:56] get into that later but you see now
[42:00] there's all these people around and John
[42:03] have a drink these people watching these
[42:11] different seeds they're want to talk
[42:13] about the seed for a little bit because
[42:16] you know it's quite important the seed
[42:18] of God there's a seed inside a
[42:21] predestined heart God knew it before the
[42:24] foundation of the world you you were
[42:28] written on that book before the world
[42:30] was even formed amen you're engraved in
[42:32] the palms of his hands
[42:34] hallelujah the joy that you're feeling
[42:36] now he was caring he was envisaged it
[42:39] was before him as he carried that cross
[42:41] he loves it when you rejoice that's what
[42:45] he did it for he wanted that fellowship
[42:47] he wanted that rejoicing bride before
[42:49] him hallelujah so there's all these
[42:52] seeds their seeds people other seeds
[42:56] know these seeds of there's two
[42:58] different seeds amen
[42:59] we'll just just go right out and say
[43:01] there's two different seeds okay two
[43:03] seats is the seed of God and the seed of
[43:05] the devil children of God and children
[43:08] of the devil right now all these bodies
[43:11] are the same your body's just as mixed
[43:14] as everybody else's body I'm not talking
[43:15] about the flesh I'm talking about
[43:17] the heart talking about what happens
[43:19] when the word comes across amen
[43:22] you're not heavens when the word comes
[43:23] across you a your gonna manifest
[43:25] something hallelujah
[43:27] you're gonna manifest your origin what
[43:30] you really are is gonna come forth amen
[43:33] okay so here John's message but stop
[43:37] when John went into the prison
[43:38] hallelujah no no it didn't stop there it
[43:41] continued on John's message just
[43:43] continued on amen amen
[43:45] so John's message now he comes up and
[43:47] now he's in having these prayer lines
[43:49] and preemies everyone's enjoying and you
[43:51] know and then he starts to and then you
[43:53] know Philip he gets blown away by what's
[43:58] going on because you see there's
[43:59] something happening and the word went
[44:02] forth the sign of the Messiah amen
[44:06] they were taught back in those days that
[44:08] the real not the religious Babylonian
[44:11] teaching but the real teaching of the
[44:13] fathers to the sons and the mothers and
[44:14] those real Jewish people that didn't buy
[44:17] into the Babylonian things and they
[44:19] taught their children when the Messiah
[44:22] comes he will do what Moses did you'll
[44:25] know the very secrets of the heart
[44:26] people just say in your heart
[44:28] hallelujah but it's going to go beyond
[44:31] that because of the light that we known
[44:33] that even you'll be a pre distance see a
[44:37] pre distance seed inside some people
[44:39] that's good because God wrote their name
[44:42] on the book before the world even began
[44:43] amen
[44:44] actually I'm going to go a little deeper
[44:46] those people rejected the devil's lie in
[44:48] eternity do you know that they rejected
[44:54] the devil's lie amen when he tried to
[44:56] deceive all the angels way back there
[44:58] hallelujah and they rejoiced amen they
[45:02] shouted they shouted for joy back there
[45:04] you know you're getting realigned to
[45:06] that image a man I can see it happening
[45:08] there's an eruption taking place we're
[45:11] coming back to that shouting image of
[45:13] jory Amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[45:16] amen
[45:17] why not fast track it hallelujah a man
[45:21] you just rejoice hallelujah so these
[45:24] seeds that are there and here here comes
[45:27] Philippa knees rejoicing and Jesus you
[45:30] know the message of John he's still
[45:32] going you know but he was in a body this
[45:34] time he's in a body the first coming
[45:36] because he had to die remember ok so
[45:38] just keep that perspective ear and
[45:40] whatever so that he's in the body and
[45:42] now his message is still going right
[45:45] Alleluia let me just put this here just
[45:48] to put her into a bit of context if the
[45:50] atonement had been made already the
[45:53] John's message would have been inside
[45:55] him John's message would have been in
[45:57] him and speaking through his lips but
[45:59] the atonement would have been made and
[46:01] the Holy Ghost could have come into John
[46:02] and the same Messiah the same Jesus the
[46:05] same person would have anointed the
[46:07] Prophet gift and spoke through John and
[46:09] done all the same things just think of
[46:12] that put Jesus inside John but the
[46:15] atonement hadn't been made he couldn't
[46:16] come into the man like that here to do
[46:19] it but he couldn't the second come he
[46:21] couldn't brother brainers ministry the
[46:23] larger of the end time could do it
[46:25] that's why I did it but it's the same
[46:28] principle the same Messiah had to be
[46:31] reintroduced to the people I'm gonna hit
[46:34] that that's gonna be one of the major
[46:35] points just as soon just soon let me get
[46:37] to the seed thing because it's just so
[46:39] good they flip so happy I mean he must
[46:44] have been rejoicing like well because
[46:46] something happened it went beyond the
[46:47] intellectual at wit beyond that it
[46:49] actually went to the eternal realm that
[46:52] eternal part of him was so stirred
[46:54] because the word came across his path
[46:56] the word the sign of the Messiah
[46:59] actually was spoken over him and Jesus
[47:02] he knew he had need to go by Philip he
[47:05] had need to go by Peter and he was using
[47:07] Philip to go to Nathaniel now so Philip
[47:10] dropped his water pot full of drop
[47:13] whatever he is doing because something
[47:14] crossed his path
[47:15] something came across him something
[47:17] touch that seed with him and then an
[47:20] unstoppable glorious resurrection power
[47:22] came forth amen hallelujah that couldn't
[47:25] stop he didn't he everything just
[47:27] changed
[47:28] right there did he that was before even
[47:31] got the Holy Ghost because it wasn't
[47:33] even poured out at that stage but there
[47:34] was enough quickening power in that seed
[47:37] hallelujah but when the word came past
[47:40] in the word crossed that path light and
[47:43] rain came in hallelujah
[47:45] inside that seed is divine intelligence
[47:48] inside the seat of God with the new His
[47:51] divine intelligence it's not your
[47:52] intelligence it's not your ability it's
[47:54] not what you can do it's in the scene
[47:57] already hallelujah amen and sow the seed
[48:02] cross Philips past he got so excited he
[48:03] dropped his water pot like the woman at
[48:06] the well he did the same thing a man he
[48:07] got all excited he just went running
[48:09] he's gotta go find his friends
[48:11] it's got to go dancing Nathaniel this is
[48:13] Nathaniel come and see I found the
[48:14] Messiah Nathaniel was like oh yeah okay
[48:16] here we go this is another food asur
[48:19] another one of these other guys but no
[48:20] this was different you could see a
[48:21] different look and Philips eyes so he
[48:23] says okay because he said come and see
[48:26] and so he comes and season and now that
[48:28] predestined seed is already starting to
[48:30] this light already happening amen this
[48:33] radiation going down into that sea
[48:34] penetrating the soil of the flesh
[48:37] hallelujah and so you know that lights
[48:40] coming down in there and Nathaniel's
[48:42] already is coming there and all of a
[48:43] sudden he crosses over from his prayer
[48:45] line and he looks over and he looks in
[48:47] this annual right in the eyes and he
[48:49] says behold an Israelite in whom there
[48:51] is no guile hallelujah light struck the
[48:54] seed hallelujah reality struck and he
[48:58] says he didn't say he didn't say
[49:00] Beelzebub he didn't say you're a devil
[49:03] he didn't say it wasn't right they
[49:05] didn't say this is different doctrine he
[49:06] didn't say this is what the Pharisee
[49:08] said he said behold the Son of God the
[49:11] king of Israel
[49:12] cuz the seed brought forth its origin
[49:16] the reality of who he really was down
[49:19] deep that reality came forth right there
[49:21] because the word struck the seed now
[49:24] that's what needs to happen for all of
[49:27] us and I'm just praying and this has
[49:29] been my prayer let it happen Lord let it
[49:33] happen let that light strike the seed
[49:36] I'm gonna read sign of the Messiah out
[49:40] of the countdown later on I'm gonna pray
[49:42] that the Lord will make it so real when
[49:45] I read that but if there's anybody in
[49:46] here that hasn't had that that
[49:48] experience that experience where they've
[49:52] been quickened and that sick and pull
[49:54] sign that sign of the Messiah that
[49:56] resurrection sign I pray that it would
[49:59] just that like would gleam over your
[50:01] heart tonight and if anybody's listening
[50:03] on that tape it will gleam over but you
[50:07] know and I've been praying what stops it
[50:09] cuz we hear these meant prayer lines and
[50:11] we hear them maybe we just get glossed
[50:14] over maybe we get like John stuck up in
[50:16] a prison in your eye gets filmed over or
[50:18] something and then something kind of can
[50:21] happen like that get too busy get too
[50:22] caught up that you're not you're not
[50:24] she and one accord with the fort that's
[50:26] being ministered you're not getting in
[50:28] the spirit of the messages that are
[50:30] actually sounding on those tapes because
[50:33] that's so important we're not just
[50:35] listening to a tape just to do our
[50:37] religious duty to learn something new
[50:39] but is us there's a reality there and
[50:42] when your thoughts can be caught up
[50:45] quick getting into the same accord as
[50:48] the thought of God when it was
[50:49] ministered the very the very substance I
[50:53] believe that you'll have an athenian
[50:56] experience
[50:56] this is blessed are you Nathaniel
[50:58] hallelujah amen he said that because I
[51:02] did that because I showed you the sign
[51:05] of the Messiah you believed you shall
[51:08] see greater things you shall see heaven
[51:10] opened hallelujah
[51:11] who wants to see him an openly men
[51:13] hallelujah Amen heaven open you shall
[51:17] see it and maybe someone in here or as
[51:20] listening hasn't seen that and it's
[51:23] still just a bunch of compilations of
[51:24] thoughts and ideas and difference from
[51:26] your denominational but there is a God
[51:29] in this place
[51:30] the world is kitted in this place if you
[51:34] just just just just just just just lay
[51:36] everything else aside and pay all your
[51:38] attention and all your worship and all
[51:40] your thinking and all your mental
[51:42] everything remember
[51:44] Mary's the the very confession of Mary
[51:47] the very word that that angel said you
[51:49] shall conceive of the Holy Ghost it
[51:52] started here there was a conception take
[51:55] place she had to agree then it went down
[51:58] so there was a conception right here
[52:00] because that's where the Beryl Graham
[52:01] begins right here so it started there
[52:04] with the word he'd laid a seed and the
[52:06] seed was life came down so you know
[52:10] there's a you just get into the spirit
[52:13] of this meeting get into the spirit of
[52:15] the message get into the Spirit of God
[52:18] and prayer when you're listening to
[52:21] tapes when your Bible study when your
[52:24] fellowshipping hallelujah don't waste
[52:26] time amen
[52:28] so let's see it and he said he just says
[52:31] you know you shall see heaven open and
[52:35] I'm just asking any of you here you want
[52:37] to see him and open
[52:38] I mean I see heaven open I see it open I
[52:42] see it open every Sunday I see it open
[52:44] every Wednesday I see it open all the
[52:45] other times in my prayer closet wherever
[52:48] I'm walking with God I see heaven open
[52:50] and it's glorious
[52:52] tell you it's more glorious than you
[52:55] could ever imagine
[52:55] if you haven't if you know when that
[52:58] when that discernment no that's not just
[53:01] a gift of prophecy it's not just another
[53:05] people it's not just psychology it's not
[53:08] just reading the mind there's a deeper
[53:11] spiritual reality behind it there's a
[53:14] purpose of God in doing it and that is a
[53:18] sign of the Messiah that you can
[53:21] recognize John's message you can
[53:24] recognize the person that is vindicating
[53:27] John's message and you will stop looking
[53:30] at a man
[53:31] louia the scoffers of this message look
[53:34] at brother ben and more than we do
[53:35] that's what they do they focus on the
[53:38] man and they never saw past them because
[53:40] they're blind because of pride arrogance
[53:43] scoffing whatever it may be you know I
[53:47] want to get a bit of a ending here later
[53:50] why it's a place that we all need to get
[53:54] to oh yeah we have been or we will be
[53:56] whatever you are you know where you're
[53:58] at and maybe you don't I pray God
[54:00] reveals it to you you know that's one of
[54:02] my prayers and it was for many years
[54:04] like Oh just show me where I stand with
[54:07] you make it real make it plain where do
[54:10] I stand with you Lord make your light
[54:12] shine in my life I want to know I'm
[54:15] walking with you Lord want to know where
[54:18] I stand in in their heavens where I
[54:21] stand because you well sit your mate a
[54:24] certain hey man so here you'll see this
[54:26] you're seated in heavenly places then

[1:03:08] hallelujah that said that heaven would
[1:03:11] release Jesus Christ after he'd been
[1:03:13] preached so long all these years of just

[1:03:52] what you really reflect amen
[1:03:55] you know the whole leading up to that
[1:03:58] time when the seals all came open was
[1:04:00] just preparation for you to meet the
[1:04:02] captain in the land just like the time
[1:04:06] of Moses the time of Israel when they
[1:04:07] came out of Egypt you know all of the
[1:04:09] books of Moses that all the
[1:04:10] deuteronomy's everything God laid out
[1:04:13] all of us what he wanted he laid out all
[1:04:16] of the ways that you can approach God
[1:04:18] and laid out all of the background and
[1:04:21] everything so that they knew what God
[1:04:23] was like and you know the Lord did the
[1:04:25] same thing for us he raised up a prophet
[1:04:28] and he preached the message and he he he
[1:04:30] said this is God likes this and he loves
[1:04:32] that do you know what it was he was
[1:04:35] closing you he was giving you perfume
[1:04:38] for the King because he knew what
[1:04:41] perfume the King liked he knew the what
[1:04:44] the scent of your prayer that the King
[1:04:46] liked he knew the smell of your life
[1:04:49] would be a sweet how to make it a sweet
[1:04:51] savour for the King and I know of a
[1:04:54] story and a man named he guy that did
[1:04:56] the same thing and Aloha and there was a
[1:05:00] year of purification it was a process it
[1:05:02] was a time where Esther was prepared
[1:05:04] because you know before she just didn't
[1:05:07] have any idea and all those other ones
[1:05:09] all those other virgins that claim the
[1:05:11] same King to be their King and they
[1:05:13] wanted to marry him as well they did
[1:05:16] their own imagination they went their
[1:05:18] own route they took the Kings word the
[1:05:20] King's doctrines the Kings perfumes and
[1:05:23] they did it according to the way they
[1:05:24] fought and it happens today people are
[1:05:26] taking the same Bible that we take
[1:05:28] they're taking the same perfume the same
[1:05:30] prayers the same everything in there
[1:05:32] trying to clothe themselves they want to
[1:05:35] be they want to wear their own apparel
[1:05:36] but they want to be called by his name 7
[1:05:39] woman shall take hold of one man but
[1:05:41] there's one hallelujah 1 Esther that had
[1:05:46] this connection with a messenger with
[1:05:49] someone that knew the king that someone
[1:05:51] they had was partial to Revelation that
[1:05:54] that perfume the king loved hallelujah
[1:05:58] preparation for a meeting preparation
[1:06:01] for a calling preparation for the
[1:06:05] defining moment of her life
[1:06:07] Alleluia but she had to be prepared she
[1:06:09] had to go through purification she had
[1:06:11] to be closed in the right clothing
[1:06:13] Alleluia see God does the preparation
[1:06:16] before there's a meeting before there's
[1:06:19] that real connection take place before
[1:06:21] the marriage can take place before the
[1:06:23] bride can come right into it for
[1:06:25] position there's a full preparation and
[1:06:29] I'm looking at those that have been
[1:06:31] clothed in the perfume that have been
[1:06:33] clothed than the right perfume more
[1:06:35] clothes than the right there all of the
[1:06:37] right ways you walk the right way
[1:06:38] talking the right way because not
[1:06:40] because you'd made it up in your own
[1:06:42] theology or mix this baptist thing here
[1:06:44] in this denominational thing here and
[1:06:46] this battle only thing here took this
[1:06:47] part of the word and that part because

[1:13:31] that intelligence stirs up when you have
[1:13:34] a revelation like Peter had a revelation

[1:13:38] everybody say I am you know and Peter
[1:13:40] sit they all said all this thing but you
[1:13:42] know but he says who do you say that I
[1:13:43] am Peter revealed the revelation that he
[1:13:46] got he revealed when when the word
[1:13:48] crossed his path there was a seed inside
[1:13:51] the communicate with his representation

[1:14:23] and stem it down with some concrete of
[1:14:25] man's ideas
[1:14:26] there's no Roman seal that can seal over
[1:14:29] that and the tomb of this flesh there is
[1:14:32] nothing there's no political power
[1:14:33] there's no cultural power there's

[1:17:17] you just keep drinking on the word
[1:17:18] rejoicing in the word getting caught up
[1:17:21] into the very thoughts you know and all

[1:17:53] have life in himself what does that mean
[1:17:55] he's a seed the corn kernel Olivia that
[1:18:00] kernel of corn Christ stuck in a tomb

[1:19:55] amen you know there was 18 consecutive
[1:20:02] manifestations of a gift of the sign of
[1:20:05] the Messiah to make that seed come to
[1:20:12] life you know all those people the that
[1:20:15] we read in the Gospels they were in

[1:21:11] because you're going fold you're moving
[1:21:14] forward in the name of the Lord
[1:21:15] hallelujah advancing on your inheritance
[1:21:19] soldiers of the Lord walking with the
[1:21:23] sword wrong taking orders from the hit
[1:21:25] ship that's resting on you Christ
[1:21:28] Himself the real headship no human
[1:21:31] government no organized religion this
[1:21:33] message is not organized religion anyone
[1:21:35] that says that this message is a
[1:21:36] denomination has no idea that there is
[1:21:38] no hierarchy because that's what makes a
[1:21:41] denomination of denomination as they
[1:21:43] form a hierarchy and they form a whole
[1:21:45] bunch of stagnant doctrines and that's
[1:21:47] it they take a photo of whatever Brett
[1:21:49] whatever was happening and that's it
[1:21:51] doesn't move but our government has a
[1:21:54] person our government is the message of
[1:21:56] John amen because you see see behold I
[1:22:00] seen you Elijah the Prophet he shall
[1:22:02] turn your heart back to the Epis taluk
[1:22:04] father's what was the message
[1:22:07] it was the same message of John they're
[1:22:09] pointing to him the person the Messiah
[1:22:12] and he does the sign to quicken hunt so
[1:22:15] that life comes forth so the
[1:22:16] resurrection power can come and combat
[1:22:18] the enemy break down the enemies chains
[1:22:21] loose the captives the lame shall walk
[1:22:24] the dead shall be raised and we see it
[1:22:26] happening hallelujah this is our God
[1:22:29] we're in the book of X amen
[1:22:33] have you seen the front-page news
[1:22:34] hallelujah we're reading the front-page
[1:22:37] news
[1:22:38] amen we're not reading a book of history
[1:22:41] hello yeah man I feel good hallelujah
[1:22:45] doesn't that make you feel good these
[1:22:48] are a rejoice rejoice in the Lord pray
[1:22:52] without ceasing and everything miss
[1:22:56] hairs
[1:22:56] Elijah's the Elijah foreigners position
[1:23:00] and prophecy John 328 it says ye
[1:23:02] yourselves bear me witness that I said I
[1:23:05] am NOT the Christ but that I am sent
[1:23:08] before him he that has the bride as the
[1:23:10] bridegroom but the friend of the
[1:23:12] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:23:15] him rejoiceth greatly because of the
[1:23:17] bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore
[1:23:20] is fulfil he must increase it I must
[1:23:23] decrease so this is exactly what has
[1:23:27] happened in both the first coming Elijah
[1:23:29] and the second coming
[1:23:30] when they win it win-win the the whole
[1:23:33] purpose of their ministries was to
[1:23:37] prepare the people and in present the
[1:23:40] booth of the Messiah amen
[1:23:43] one was a physical Messiah the next was
[1:23:45] a spiritual is a spiritual Messiah and
[1:23:48] he has come in the fullness of his power
[1:23:51] to bring his bride into the fullness of
[1:23:54] her inheritance and there is no other
[1:23:57] government can do it denominational
[1:23:59] governments can't do it the war is too
[1:24:02] strong the devil is too smart for our
[1:24:04] own intelligence that's why the Devils
[1:24:06] outsmarted the denomination's because
[1:24:07] they're led by men and he just has some
[1:24:10] wrapped around his little finger and
[1:24:11] down in the fashions of Hollywood or
[1:24:13] down in some legal aswer or some liberal
[1:24:15] way caught up and they think that
[1:24:19] they're all right because supernatural
[1:24:20] things happen but the rains just falling
[1:24:22] on the unjust you look at their lives
[1:24:26] they do not get transformed they do not
[1:24:28] get changed
[1:24:29] they live just like the world because
[1:24:32] the overcoming transforming power cannot
[1:24:34] happen in their hierarchy cannot happen
[1:24:37] with a hybrid teaching it has to be
[1:24:39] Christ he must increase in I must
[1:24:47] decrease and we saw that when the
[1:24:50] Prophet preached the Seventh Seal
[1:24:52] he brought these things out he said that
[1:24:56] I must I'm gonna basically say I'm
[1:24:59] leaving the scene he's taken over and
[1:25:03] now Christ is moving in that ministry
[1:25:06] like never before I mean it was still
[1:25:09] brother Branham remember don't get me
[1:25:10] wrong we're not saying that he turned
[1:25:11] into God himself it was God using the
[1:25:15] gift using the office amen but it was
[1:25:19] the season that he could reveal himself
[1:25:22] in that way just like John know he that
[1:25:30] cometh from above those above all he
[1:25:32] that is of the earth is earthly and
[1:25:34] speaketh of the earth he that cometh
[1:25:36] from heaven is above all and what he has
[1:25:40] seen and heard that he testifies and no
[1:25:43] man
[1:25:44] Eva's destiny you see you realize John
[1:25:47] by saying my message this person that is
[1:25:52] going around doing these things and
[1:25:54] shiny sign and he probably thought as a
[1:25:56] man everyone's gonna receive this guy
[1:25:59] you know like this is his life but then
[1:26:01] when has testimony the proof that we're
[1:26:05] Testaments the proof and witness proof
[1:26:07] proof is it in a testament and he starts
[1:26:12] speaking i my father away if you eat
[1:26:15] this flesh and drink my blood you should
[1:26:16] have you have unless you do that you
[1:26:18] have no life in you they no one received
[1:26:21] it it was it was so different so alien
[1:26:24] he they have received those testimony
[1:26:28] has said to her seal that god is true so
[1:26:32] this the other side is actually a people
[1:26:34] that did receive it hallelujah and i
[1:26:36] know that these are people in this room
[1:26:37] that did receive it
[1:26:38] amen hallelujah and you have said to
[1:26:42] your seal a meant for him whom the lord
[1:26:48] has sent speak of the words of God for
[1:26:50] God giveth not the spirit by measure
[1:26:52] unto Him the Father loves the Son and
[1:26:54] has given all things into his hand he
[1:26:57] that believeth on the son has
[1:26:58] everlasting life and he that believeth
[1:27:00] not the son shall not see life but the
[1:27:03] wrath of God abideth on him I just want
[1:27:05] to hold him now on verse 33 John 333 I
[1:27:08] didn't realize it he that hath received
[1:27:11] his testimony has set to her seal that

[1:32:57] revelation gates of hell won't prevail
[1:33:00] against and sometimes you're going you
[1:33:03] know sometimes they're you're gonna be
[1:33:04] on the defense unfortunately that's just
[1:33:06] what happens you you make a mistake
[1:33:08] something happens or you get too busy
[1:33:10] and all of a sudden the devil gives you
[1:33:11] with that right but when you smack you
[1:33:13] but the gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:33:14] against it there's no way you you just
[1:33:18] cannot be stopped and you get back up
[1:33:21] and God sends this one and that one and
[1:33:22] surround you with the body because every
[1:33:25] joint supplies versus the glory that we
[1:33:29] have right here every joint supplies the
[1:33:32] gifts are operating supernatural God is
[1:33:36] taking place AB God is a supernatural
[1:33:38] God don't forget that you don't have to
[1:33:42] conquer things by the tree of knowledge
[1:33:44] there's nothing wrong sometimes you need
[1:33:46] to but whatever but you've got the Tree
[1:33:48] of Life now you have the Tree of Life
[1:33:51] hallelujah to walk that path to live
[1:33:54] that path you're gonna have to come out
[1:33:56] of the rut of the trek of your normal
[1:33:59] thoughts everything that you were if
[1:34:01] educated all the ways and paradigms of
[1:34:03] education and everything like that from
[1:34:04] the tree of knowledge as a rut that
[1:34:06] you're so used to he's so comfortable
[1:34:08] going down that road and then here comes
[1:34:11] a message I love an open book
[1:34:13] this is actually the real knowledge this
[1:34:17] is the real wisdom this wisdom is
[1:34:20] different from the track that you always
[1:34:22] went down and the splashes just made
[1:34:25] that way and you have to start staring
[1:34:28] out of that track cuz you've got the
[1:34:29] menu you have dominion and you've got
[1:34:33] heaven behind you cuz you're an
[1:34:35] ambassador and God has called you to
[1:34:37] come out of those ruts God's called you
[1:34:40] to come out of their way of thinking go
[1:34:43] against the grain hey man
[1:34:46] hallelujah you remember that seed inside
[1:34:49] you that's what's driving it that's the
[1:34:52] driving hallelujah when you feed it you
[1:34:55] feed it it'll grow you keep feeding it
[1:34:59] it's gonna go you're gonna get stronger
[1:35:02] the Bible says be strengthened in the
[1:35:05] inner men you gotta feed it and I don't
[1:35:09] just now this is that that you can read
[1:35:11] the Bible and not feed the seed you can
[1:35:14] read the Bible and get nothing you've
[1:35:17] got to get in the spirit
[1:35:18] and that sounds maybe it sounds a bit
[1:35:21] cliche but you actually have to get in
[1:35:23] the spirit
[1:35:23] hallelujah it's like I don't know go
[1:35:27] spend some time and Africa or something
[1:35:29] I'm joking but those people know how to
[1:35:31] get in the spirit man they've got the
[1:35:33] fabric between eternity and time is very
[1:35:36] different they just seem to this just
[1:35:39] know they're already in the spirit
[1:35:41] they're dancing and they're flipping and
[1:35:43] they're doing all sorts of amazing
[1:35:44] things and they've got this faith now we
[1:35:47] can learn something from that we can
[1:35:49] learn something from that we're just as
[1:35:51] human we're all the same and it's just
[1:35:54] cultural differences this just you know
[1:35:56] history because they've had history of
[1:35:58] spiritual and whatever and we come from
[1:36:00] a history you know it's quiet and you
[1:36:02] know scientific now white people have
[1:36:05] just gone so far on the tree of
[1:36:06] knowledge so deep into the sciences and
[1:36:10] and all of our you know of well I'm
[1:36:12] speaking for me anyway
[1:36:13] very scientific very logic based but
[1:36:17] remember logic is - because down the
[1:36:20] logic do learn and education is not the
[1:36:22] logic of heaven actually that's
[1:36:25] engineered
[1:36:26] against the logic of heaven these two
[1:36:28] logics two logics the Tree of Knowledge
[1:36:31] and the Tree of Life that's it and you
[1:36:35] boil it all down these two it's the
[1:36:37] logic of Satan and the logic of heaven
[1:36:40] and and yes we can we can apply some of
[1:36:43] those laws and principles and do those
[1:36:44] things when we are working in this world
[1:36:47] but really there's a higher logic
[1:36:49] there's a higher reasoning there's a
[1:36:52] higher imagination there's a higher
[1:36:54] cause in effect
[1:36:56] amen it goes beyond physics goes beyond
[1:37:00] possibility goes beyond unbelief those
[1:37:04] ruts of unbelief in those ways that
[1:37:05] we've always thought there's a seed
[1:37:07] inside you that's pushing you out of
[1:37:08] those ruts right now pushing you out but
[1:37:11] you've just got to fight and if you keep
[1:37:13] fighting you're gonna keep growing cuz
[1:37:15] you're gonna start enjoying your prayer
[1:37:16] life you're gonna start enjoying your
[1:37:18] Bible studies you're going to be caught
[1:37:20] up in the thoughts of God hallelujah now
[1:37:23] how that manifests is different in all
[1:37:26] people I'm not saying that people that
[1:37:28] don't do what I do and jump around it's
[1:37:30] not the same not that's not what I'm
[1:37:33] saying but these are is a place for the
[1:37:36] believer a real place it's a good place
[1:37:40] and it's a place where you're in
[1:37:43] communion all the time hallelujah I'm
[1:37:49] gonna read one thing I'm gonna pass a
[1:37:51] lot here
[1:38:01] I don't want to bet I will
[1:38:04] we will amen I'm gonna finish up of this
[1:38:07] Elijah yeah why did I have to I have to
[1:38:16] touch this because otherwise it just
[1:38:18] doesn't put the context and maybe I'll
[1:38:20] pick it up again another time I probably
[1:38:23] will actually but why did God have to
[1:38:28] reintroduce the Messiah when we read in
[1:38:31] the book of Hebrews that and that sundry
[1:38:35] times and in divers manners God spake to
[1:38:38] us through the prophets but now through
[1:38:41] son and the headship came to the body
[1:38:45] and in the measure that he came to the
[1:38:49] first church all but the broke open book
[1:38:52] had everything the open book seals were
[1:38:57] not loosed in that day but the book was
[1:38:58] purchased but there was seven ages the
[1:39:04] book was opened in that age they would
[1:39:05] have taken a rapture remember that
[1:39:09] because they would have eaten the thing
[1:39:10] that Adam and Eve because what do you
[1:39:14] realize what you're eating this is not
[1:39:16] just like I said I keep repeating myself
[1:39:18] but this is not just another ministry
[1:39:20] it's not just mysteries you're eating if
[1:39:27] I can if you just get one thing tonight
[1:39:29] maybe you're eating the tree of life
[1:39:33] just you just think about that get
[1:39:36] caught up in that for practice how to
[1:39:39] get caught up in the Ford of God and
[1:39:40] you'll be jumping oh you'll be jumping
[1:39:42] brother branham had to vent in he would
[1:39:44] run around the trees and do whatever he
[1:39:46] said if you saw what I was like you'd
[1:39:48] think I was going to go and mad because
[1:39:51] he got caught up in the fall you're
[1:39:54] eating the tree of life now why did God
[1:39:57] have to reintroduce Wow
[1:39:59] so here's Christ leading the church the
[1:40:02] hip leading the church and we know that
[1:40:04] the angel of the Lord as he is now right
[1:40:07] he's doing again but but because of the
[1:40:09] book of Acts when the book of Acts is in
[1:40:11] its environment
[1:40:13] he's an angel but angel of the Lord the
[1:40:15] same angel that led the children of
[1:40:16] Israel through to promise man God said
[1:40:19] my name is enough Paul says I might who
[1:40:24] I am I actually I'm owned by this angel
[1:40:27] I serve them because this angel is
[1:40:30] actually Jesus Christ an angelic form
[1:40:32] leading his church okay so he's leaving
[1:40:36] the church and they've got all this so
[1:40:38] why would at the end time
[1:40:41] another forerunner have to reintroduce
[1:40:44] Christ that's already here I tell you
[1:40:50] he's here 1 John 4:3 and every spirit
[1:40:57] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ
[1:40:58] has come in the flesh is not of God you
[1:41:02] see the entities and this is that spirit
[1:41:05] of Antichrist whereof you have heard
[1:41:07] that it should come and even now already
[1:41:09] is it in the world so yes it will fully
[1:41:13] manifest them become a person and later
[1:41:15] on it would become the beast and all
[1:41:17] those things right but it was already
[1:41:20] there the spirit of Antichrist what the
[1:41:22] spirit of I'm gonna come I'm gonna give
[1:41:24] you a new word
[1:41:24] I made this word of Acts I couldn't
[1:41:27] there's probably a real word for it but
[1:41:29] I made a word up so this the spirit of
[1:41:40] Antichrist wants to historicai the Lord
[1:41:43] [Laughter]
[1:41:46] there's probably a real word for her
[1:41:48] like to put something that's meat to be
[1:41:50] right now and make him historical so so
[1:41:54] the spirit of Antichrist wants to
[1:41:56] history and the way you historicai him
[1:42:00] as by mixing his word mixing it up
[1:42:04] because his word of spirit in life so
[1:42:07] the moment you start mixing it mixes
[1:42:10] word and you have no power and if Satan
[1:42:13] thinks that's pretty good he'll put her
[1:42:14] spirit in it that's what he's done with
[1:42:16] all these funny cults and you know the
[1:42:19] you know you notice a cult or you notice
[1:42:21] like a you know a movement of God not
[1:42:23] God sorry well it may have been but it
[1:42:25] been it turns
[1:42:28] what happens is there's a particular
[1:42:29] thought inside that group and it just
[1:42:33] seems to propel that group into another
[1:42:34] big thing and it's arrogant and every
[1:42:38] time you fellowship they just get
[1:42:40] straight to them cuz it rolls them
[1:42:42] because it was a it was a hybrid thought
[1:42:45] and they mixed something together and
[1:42:47] Satan was like well I'm gonna use that
[1:42:49] it's like a tumor and he hops in cider
[1:42:51] and then he just grows and the people
[1:42:53] live for that one thing they live for
[1:42:56] that and seventh-day adventists every
[1:42:59] time you ever talk to them every book
[1:43:00] they ever write it always goes straight
[1:43:02] to that seventh day and it's just such a
[1:43:05] minor thing and the whole grand scheme
[1:43:07] of everything but devil got hold of it
[1:43:09] and this is exactly what happened
[1:43:12] yes Christ was leading the church yes it
[1:43:16] was all going good but the season wasn't
[1:43:20] for them to go in the rapture they came
[1:43:24] to such a point that if they win any
[1:43:25] further they would have had the open
[1:43:27] book the book the seals would have come
[1:43:29] open and they would have gone on the
[1:43:30] rapture and we wouldn't even be here
[1:43:32] maybe we'll just bypass this whole of me
[1:43:35] because we'd have to be somewhere
[1:43:36] because we were already in his mind but
[1:43:39] but we had to be expressed in this earth
[1:43:42] for a purpose of redemption and to to
[1:43:46] reciprocate the love of our Savior of
[1:43:49] our God and His Redemption oh my but yet
[1:43:54] so the church actually hybridized
[1:43:56] everything and it became governed by man
[1:43:59] and organized religion and and it's it
[1:44:01] and what happened was all the power the
[1:44:04] altar got broken now the altar was
[1:44:07] broken and Jezebel I have and all the
[1:44:11] prophets of bail started rolling the
[1:44:13] church that's why she's in the book of
[1:44:15] Revelation that doctrines of Balaam and
[1:44:18] Jezebel this false prophetess raising up
[1:44:21] Roman Catholicism and all these things
[1:44:24] to kill millions and millions of people
[1:44:27] Satan starting to rule over the people
[1:44:30] in the name of religion religion
[1:44:33] Christianity and religion and you know
[1:44:37] and it grew and grew like a cancer
[1:44:41] crushed down the word crush down the the
[1:44:44] seed until it was just a stump that's
[1:44:48] why God had to reintroduce the reality
[1:44:52] of himself because he became veiled over
[1:44:56] with men's traditions man's Jesus is you
[1:45:00] worship in vain to the people of their
[1:45:03] Daisy howbeit you worship in vain
[1:45:05] because you teach for doctrines the
[1:45:08] commandments of men when you start
[1:45:10] teaching the commandments of men
[1:45:12] your worship is vain because it just
[1:45:17] gets cancerous the Lord when this church
[1:45:22] form said if you remain humble I will
[1:45:26] draw my people into my rest in my word
[1:45:28] shall go forth from this place you know
[1:45:31] that humility and the true fivefold
[1:45:34] ministry humble so that it's Christ that
[1:45:38] can operate the gift not man any when
[1:45:42] man gets ambitious Satan goes oh I might
[1:45:46] use this guy you know and it'll this is
[1:45:50] where historicize the Lord because now
[1:45:53] something changes and that gift is no
[1:45:56] longer being operated
[1:45:57] I love the divine love of God now being
[1:46:02] operated by fear or operated by ambition
[1:46:05] and it pulls the people out of the takes
[1:46:09] Christ out of the prison it takes you
[1:46:12] know God's moving he moves his church he
[1:46:14] does this and he moves here and he wants
[1:46:16] to pour this and he wants to reveal that
[1:46:18] he's doing this and he'll move he's the
[1:46:20] hit he's the general his campaign it's
[1:46:23] his burden he gives little parts of his
[1:46:26] burden to the ministry that's humble
[1:46:28] that'll walk with him and move when he
[1:46:30] moves but then an ambition comes up and
[1:46:32] then it takes the people into history or
[1:46:35] that another ambition will take the
[1:46:37] people into the Millennium already or
[1:46:39] into some funny thing but a humble gift
[1:46:43] will keep the people walking with God
[1:46:46] but
[1:46:47] Church this is why we read in the book
[1:46:52] of Kings because remember the Book of
[1:46:54] Kings and Jesus Bell and a have types
[1:46:56] the very end time I'm not gonna get him
[1:46:59] to that we can get brother Adrian to do
[1:47:01] that he's very good at those things
[1:47:03] those right into the details of all of
[1:47:06] the gears Abell religion and prophecy
[1:47:08] and all that stuff so I'm not gonna help
[1:47:10] the head at all but I just want to show
[1:47:12] you the purpose of Elijah you see when
[1:47:15] Elijah comes he challenges the spirit of
[1:47:17] the age so here's the church in this
[1:47:21] morbid condition
[1:47:24] you know God started moving and working
[1:47:26] and bringing the people gradually out of
[1:47:28] Rome but they keep bringing Roman stuff
[1:47:30] with them and they keep dominating and
[1:47:33] God wasn't finished you see what I mean
[1:47:39] he's the church look you don't have to
[1:47:45] serve the church to be saved I mean he
[1:47:48] started but but but they brought all the
[1:47:51] Catholicism all the bevel on with him
[1:47:52] all the ideas of men still came there
[1:47:55] one thing so God winked at they're
[1:47:57] ignorant because he was doing something
[1:47:59] but he didn't want them to just get a
[1:48:02] hierarchy as soon as they formed a man's
[1:48:05] government they died because the Holy
[1:48:10] Ghost was not fast moves on again and he
[1:48:15] keeps moving on and moving on and
[1:48:17] bringing the people further out of Roman
[1:48:18] Catholicism further out of Babylon but
[1:48:20] every time they started getting
[1:48:23] comfortable stopped it
[1:48:25] put a government over it and set it in
[1:48:27] stone and God moved on and they died the
[1:48:33] real Messiah had to be reintroduced
[1:48:35] without any Roman thoughts without any
[1:48:38] man's ideas that's why yeah but let's
[1:48:42] just look at it the condition was the
[1:48:45] approach to God was broken the you know
[1:48:49] the real approach to God when we boil it
[1:48:52] down true baptism baptism and the name
[1:48:56] of Jesus Christ the revelation of real
[1:48:59] the real God
[1:49:00] who Jesus Christ really yes you know
[1:49:03] those fundamental foundations of faith
[1:49:06] Satan just took it right out of them
[1:49:09] they don't have it they just don't have
[1:49:12] it the altar was broken Jezebel was
[1:49:18] ruling all all of her daughters all the
[1:49:22] 450 denomination prophets of bail and
[1:49:24] the false prophets of the Lord all of
[1:49:27] them rolling stiffen Elisha amen Elisha
[1:49:33] snibson
[1:49:33] God needed someone that could challenge
[1:49:36] that Jezebel spirit challenged that
[1:49:39] spirit of the age someone to push in and
[1:49:42] just only Elijah could do that it's that
[1:49:46] nature so here comes Elijah I read this
[1:49:50] in a more finished
[1:49:58] things eating and Elijah said unto the
[1:50:00] people come near unto me and all the
[1:50:02] people came near unto him and he
[1:50:03] repaired the altar see this is the
[1:50:07] Ministry of Elijah to repair the altar
[1:50:10] what's the altar the approach to God to
[1:50:14] bring the people back into a real
[1:50:16] relationship with God the altar has to
[1:50:19] be restored who broke it down the Bale
[1:50:21] province they just neglected that they
[1:50:25] were focused on the doctrines of Balaam
[1:50:27] and all these other things and it sees
[1:50:29] an Elijah took 12 stones I'm sorry and
[1:50:32] he repaired the altar which had been of
[1:50:34] the Lord that was broken down and Elijah
[1:50:37] took 12 stones according to the number
[1:50:39] of the tribes of the son of Jacob now
[1:50:41] remember we are founded on the doctrine
[1:50:43] of the apostles and prophets the
[1:50:45] foundation 12 foundation stones okay so
[1:50:49] when Elijah comes and turns your heart
[1:50:51] back to the Apostolic fathers your turn
[1:50:53] back to the that to that true altar
[1:50:56] again your turn back to the twelve
[1:50:58] stones the Epis taluk faith the
[1:51:01] Apostolic Faith is John's message of
[1:51:03] going around in circles but it's to show
[1:51:05] you something that it's a person that
[1:51:06] we're being that there's an altar that's
[1:51:08] been restored now this is here and with
[1:51:15] the stones he built an altar in the name
[1:51:19] of the Lord hear me O Lord hear me I'm
[1:51:20] dropping down to verse 37 hear me that
[1:51:23] this people may know that thou art the
[1:51:24] Lord God and that thou has turned their
[1:51:27] heart back again this is Old Testament
[1:51:30] now are you seeing the parallel here
[1:51:33] turn their heart back again this is the
[1:51:37] the nature of that ministry to challenge
[1:51:40] the Jezebel spirit to to rip the
[1:51:44] foundation from under the prophets of
[1:51:45] bale and all they Babylonians thought
[1:51:48] all those cultures quicken the seed and
[1:51:53] turn their hearts back to the true and
[1:51:58] living God turn their hearts back again
[1:52:01] now then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:52:05] consumed the burnt sacrifice now God has
[1:52:09] restored melter
[1:52:11] he's restored an altar in our day all
[1:52:15] the 12 stones their hearts been turned
[1:52:17] but there's an sacrifice that needs to
[1:52:20] fall on that altar you know who that
[1:52:22] sacrifices you know I know who that is
[1:52:28] brother bin knows who it is I'm sure you
[1:52:31] know who it is it's you if you want
[1:52:36] everything that God has got for you in
[1:52:40] this message you need to fall on the
[1:52:43] altar that's been restored you really
[1:52:46] need to fall on the altar if you want
[1:52:48] the fire to burn out all of the
[1:52:51] Babylonian stuff to cleanse you
