[15:02] you
[15:03] amen great to have you welcome amen
[15:09] if you've got the scriptures handy we're
[15:10] just going to go to
[15:13] the gospel of mark in the 10th chapter
[15:34] amen is everyone there verse we're going
[15:36] to read from verse 17
[15:38] just a very familiar piece of scripture
[15:41] to everyone
[15:47] and when he was gone forth into the way
[15:49] this is jesus
[15:51] there came one running and kneeled to
[15:54] him and asked him good master
[15:56] what shall i do that i may inherit
[15:58] eternal life
[16:00] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[16:03] me good
[16:04] there is none good but one that is god
[16:07] thou knowest the commandments do not
[16:09] commit adultery
[16:10] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[16:13] false witness
[16:14] defraud not honor thy father and mother
[16:18] and he answered and said unto him master
[16:20] all these have i observed
[16:22] from my youth then jesus beholding him
[16:25] loved him
[16:26] and said unto him one thing thou lackest
[16:30] go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and
[16:32] give to the poor
[16:34] that thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[16:36] and come
[16:37] take up the cross and follow me and he
[16:41] was sad
[16:41] at that saying and went away grieved
[16:45] for he had great possessions
[16:49] amen let's just let's pray together
[16:55] lord jesus lord we wanna
[16:58] thank you for your word thank you lord
[17:01] that
[17:02] there's parts of your word which are
[17:05] full of rejoicing
[17:07] and there's parts of your word which cut
[17:09] very close to the bone
[17:11] lord that are very uh
[17:15] i don't know how to describe it but lord
[17:17] i just pray as we
[17:19] uh would come to remember your death
[17:21] burial resurrection
[17:23] lord we'd take of the lord's supper
[17:26] dear god and footwashing lord i just
[17:28] pray there'd be
[17:29] such an atmosphere here of your presence
[17:31] law
[17:32] dear god we do not desire to go through
[17:35] a ritual
[17:36] lord just because it's been quite some
[17:38] time since we have partaken
[17:41] but lord we want to come with real
[17:42] sincerity lord and real
[17:45] thanksgiving lord i just pray you'll
[17:48] just
[17:49] speak to our hearts lord amen lord we
[17:51] just ask these things in your wonderful
[17:53] name
[17:54] and name the lord jesus christ lord may
[17:56] you just anoint speaker one more time
[17:58] and hear her
[17:59] lord we just want to just surrender the
[18:01] service and ourselves into your hands
[18:04] in jesus christ's name we ask amen
[18:07] amen god bless you you may you may have
[18:09] your seats this
[18:10] uh tonight so i'd like to uh
[18:14] to speak about the rich young ruler
[18:16] tonight
[18:18] you know brother branham he would
[18:20] dramatize when israel
[18:21] would come out of uh come out of egypt
[18:25] and
[18:25] the first passover was a very serious
[18:28] event
[18:29] it was a very uh it was done in great
[18:32] haste
[18:33] you know it was a a time of rejoicing
[18:35] because
[18:36] this was the last night they'd spend in
[18:38] egypt that house they were in they
[18:40] weren't going to stay there no more
[18:42] but yet even in that great time of
[18:44] rejoicing there was
[18:46] there was death in the land it was a
[18:47] very serious night a very sobering night
[18:50] because they would have realized that
[18:52] the only thing between them and that
[18:53] death angel was the blood
[18:54] that was the only thing it wasn't
[18:56] because their israelites wasn't because
[18:58] they were good it wasn't because they
[18:59] were smart or
[19:00] didn't matter what part of his role they
[19:02] were in if uh one of the princes or one
[19:04] of the least
[19:05] the only thing between them and the
[19:06] death angel was the blood
[19:09] and there would have been great
[19:10] rejoicing when death didn't strike their
[19:13] house
[19:14] they heard a great cry through egypt but
[19:16] that cry wasn't from their house
[19:18] it was from the other's house that
[19:19] decided not to apply the blood
[19:22] but brother branham tells us that you
[19:23] know there came a time when taking the
[19:26] lamb to the priest on behalf of the
[19:28] family or yourself because of sin
[19:30] it started off as a very sincere thing
[19:32] but it became a
[19:34] family tradition somehow as it was
[19:37] passed down from father to son and you
[19:39] know
[19:40] mother to daughter and to the next
[19:41] generations it just became something
[19:44] they did
[19:45] as opposed to with great thanksgiving to
[19:47] jehovah god and great reverence and
[19:49] respect and love that
[19:51] he had provided a way though it was just
[19:53] an animal life that was given
[19:55] they could be so thankful that their
[19:57] sins were not attributed to them anymore
[19:59] but the blood had taken care of their
[20:01] sin but it became a family tradition
[20:03] maybe of something of pomp and pride as
[20:06] the
[20:06] greatest of the um greatest of the
[20:08] families would take their perfect lamb
[20:10] or their perfect bullock and
[20:11] maybe parade it through the streets and
[20:13] it'd be a big fan fair kind of thing
[20:15] and the sincerity of the event was gone
[20:19] but we must never ever ever ever
[20:22] ever let that happen this must never
[20:25] even
[20:26] even just to you just think about we can
[20:28] read the word of god
[20:29] we can hear a vindicated voice in this
[20:32] day of darkness and confusion
[20:34] that god said to the earth we can hear
[20:36] it and he and god put it in our language
[20:40] you following me most of us english is
[20:42] our first language
[20:43] and even if english is not our first
[20:44] language most has been translated into a
[20:46] language we can understand
[20:48] and god caused it to come our way we
[20:50] weren't looking for him
[20:52] doesn't matter how what we think we were
[20:54] we weren't looking
[20:55] but he found us because there was a
[20:57] blood that had to cover you and i
[21:00] and god was searching till we were
[21:01] covered amen
[21:03] and we must say we must never ever take
[21:06] these things for granted
[21:07] i believe you know even as i said just
[21:10] to read his word to hear the message
[21:12] what an incredible blessing one
[21:14] incredible thing that this world is
[21:16] groping in
[21:17] gross darkness this is a rise and shine
[21:20] for thy light has come
[21:22] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[21:24] thee it's not a natural glory it's not
[21:26] an earthly glory
[21:27] it's the glory of heaven of almighty god
[21:29] has risen upon thee
[21:31] and this rich this this young rich man
[21:35] you know
[21:36] we watch the play that cloverdale did
[21:37] about this and something sometimes
[21:39] things just anchor in your spirit and
[21:41] you know and he was a good boy
[21:45] he kept all the commandments he was an
[21:48] outstanding member of his community
[21:51] he wasn't like he wasn't like the woman
[21:53] at the well
[21:54] he wasn't like legion he wasn't like any
[21:57] of those kind of people
[21:58] no doubt we would all probably want him
[22:00] as a neighbor
[22:01] and he would help us and he would be
[22:03] good to us and he would you know he
[22:05] would you know he would be known as
[22:07] as as a great young man
[22:10] and many of us no doubt would actually
[22:12] want our boys to be like this
[22:15] because he observed all these
[22:16] commandments from his youth so he wasn't
[22:18] just
[22:19] you know he was serious about his his
[22:21] walk with god
[22:22] he was sarah you know he was a he was a
[22:24] good young man
[22:26] good morals good character but it goes
[22:29] to show that we can have the best
[22:31] character
[22:32] we can have you know brother brown said
[22:34] a man can be good can pay his tithes
[22:36] help his neighbor do
[22:37] everything but yet without a new birth
[22:39] is still outside the kingdom of god
[22:41] that's how serious it
[22:42] is so this this young man as we call him
[22:46] the rich young ruler
[22:48] if he said if he was lying when he said
[22:50] to jesus that he had observed all these
[22:52] things from his youth jesus would have
[22:54] told him that he was lying
[22:56] but jesus actually acknowledged you have
[22:58] done this what you have just said
[23:00] you have done and it even says that
[23:02] jesus beheld him
[23:04] and loved him so really you know many
[23:07] people say well jesus loves me that is
[23:09] true but it's your response to his love
[23:11] that matters
[23:12] it's your response back to god your
[23:15] attitude towards him is the thing that's
[23:17] important
[23:18] and so here he was but there was one
[23:21] thing
[23:22] he lacked one thing
[23:25] it wasn't a big obvious thing it wasn't
[23:28] a big glaring
[23:29] thing one thing
[23:32] he lacked one thing here he came to the
[23:35] one who could give him eternal life
[23:37] his priest couldn't give him to him the
[23:39] rabbi couldn't give it to him the the
[23:40] synagogue couldn't give to him
[23:42] the high priest couldn't give it to him
[23:43] he came and he found this man and he
[23:45] realized that this one could give me
[23:47] eternal life
[23:48] he says what must i do
[23:51] and jesus says you're lacking one thing
[23:54] we never want to lack one thing one
[23:56] thing we don't never want to lack
[23:59] and he he had to be willing to give up
[24:02] his identity what he thought about
[24:04] himself
[24:04] in order to receive eternal life he
[24:06] identified himself in his riches
[24:09] you know in his in his you know in his
[24:11] money in his wealth
[24:13] and there was a lot of pressure no doubt
[24:14] because his dad would have been his
[24:16] parents would have been real proud of
[24:17] him
[24:18] they would have they would have
[24:19] basically put him on a pedestal look at
[24:21] our son
[24:22] our son's not like your son our son's
[24:24] better than your son
[24:25] and so there was a pressure on him to to
[24:28] stay in this kind of a mold
[24:30] but he knew that that mole didn't help
[24:32] him it couldn't meet the satisfaction
[24:34] it couldn't satisfy the longing that he
[24:37] had
[24:38] and he it's amazing because he came to
[24:39] the source of eternal life he was
[24:41] speaking
[24:42] wouldn't that be wouldn't you love that
[24:44] kind of an audience
[24:45] to talk to god in the flesh yes talk to
[24:48] him
[24:50] i don't know what i don't know what i'd
[24:51] say i'd be like the one with the well
[24:54] probably
[24:56] just pour it out but he came to the
[25:00] right one
[25:01] he didn't ask for someone's opinion he
[25:04] went to the source
[25:06] but jesus says this is the thing you are
[25:08] lacking
[25:10] but he wasn't willing to give up what he
[25:13] thought about himself
[25:15] he wasn't willing to surrender
[25:19] himself to what the lord wanted him to
[25:21] do
[25:22] you know it's so easy to hold on to
[25:23] pride it's so easy to hold on to
[25:26] this idea about ourselves
[25:30] you know brother brown would tell the
[25:32] story of a
[25:34] i heard brother donnie reagan say this
[25:35] and and one you know
[25:37] things just stick with you someone put
[25:39] it on youtubers little clip but brother
[25:42] brown tells the story of a little boy
[25:43] he'd never seen a mirror before he goes
[25:46] to his relative's house i can't remember
[25:48] what relative it is
[25:49] he sees a he sees a full door sized
[25:51] mirror
[25:52] and he walks in front of it and he
[25:54] thinks there's another boy he doesn't
[25:55] think it's him he's never seen himself
[25:57] and then he begins to move and the boy
[25:59] moves he moves the boy moves he does
[26:01] this the boy does this he says mama
[26:03] it's me it's a reflection
[26:06] and the thing is we want our reflection
[26:10] to match this right we as as the prophet
[26:13] will tell us
[26:14] we want our experience to match god's
[26:16] bible
[26:18] right we want our walk our life to match
[26:20] god's bible not try and
[26:22] not try and make the bible match our
[26:23] life but we want to match the bible
[26:25] and so he saw an image of himself and he
[26:28] found out he was lining up because he
[26:30] was making that image
[26:32] but the problem is people
[26:36] they make an image of what they think a
[26:38] christian should be
[26:40] it may be preached them for years they
[26:42] may have formed it in their own mind
[26:44] but they make an image of what a
[26:46] christian really is
[26:48] but it comes down to those last moments
[26:51] of life
[26:53] when the mental faculties begin to go
[26:56] and people begin to realize
[26:58] am i matched up with the image of the
[26:59] word
[27:01] brother brown would tell another story
[27:02] and it was more than a story it really
[27:04] happened
[27:06] of a lady who turned down now i just
[27:08] want to put it this way
[27:10] there's a line we can cross there's two
[27:13] lines we can cross
[27:15] one is you can never receive mercy again
[27:18] the other one is you can never receive
[27:20] judgment again there's two lines
[27:23] you cross one or the other are you
[27:25] following me tonight
[27:28] so he he'd tell a story of a of a
[27:31] of a of a lady she turned down
[27:34] really meeting the lord jesus and but
[27:37] she was religious she was a sunday
[27:38] school teacher in a big denomination
[27:40] and she was on death's door and the
[27:43] sunday school
[27:45] were all in the hospital room she was
[27:47] going to die and they were going to
[27:48] watch the angels come down and take her
[27:49] to heaven
[27:50] and the pastor was strolling up and down
[27:53] the hallway smoking cigarettes all
[27:54] stressed out
[27:55] and as she was dying but me that her
[27:59] mental faculties
[28:00] began to leave her her reasoning began
[28:02] to leave her and her true state
[28:05] came to her forefront because she for
[28:08] years had reasoned i'm okay
[28:10] i'm okay i go to church i'm a sunday
[28:12] school teacher
[28:13] i believe in jesus i'm okay but then
[28:16] when the reasoning
[28:17] begin to leave she didn't accept god's
[28:20] provided way
[28:22] it's very simple repent be baptized in
[28:24] the lord jesus christ and you shall
[28:25] receive the gift of the holy ghost make
[28:26] sure you get the holy ghost
[28:28] don't start the first two get all the
[28:30] way through right
[28:31] but so but she tried to bypass that and
[28:34] she began to reason i'm all right but
[28:36] then when she was dying
[28:37] all the reasoning left her and she
[28:40] realized i'm lost
[28:41] and she better cry out with anguish i'm
[28:43] lost go get that other girl or go get
[28:45] that preacher and get tell the copy i've
[28:47] lost and then the
[28:48] then the her pastor came in she said you
[28:50] deceiver of men i'm lost
[28:52] and the pastor said to the nurse give
[28:53] her a hypo to calm her down
[28:56] and that's her state she died in
[28:59] because in her mind there was an image
[29:02] of christianity
[29:04] that she had that she held that she was
[29:05] looking at her whole life
[29:07] it was the wrong image it was the
[29:10] incorrect one
[29:11] and then when her reasonings begin to
[29:13] fall the real
[29:14] image of who she was flashed before her
[29:17] come on
[29:18] that's right we don't want to have the
[29:21] wrong
[29:22] you say but i'm in the message you can
[29:24] still have the wrong
[29:26] image of christianity in your mind
[29:29] we must know him amen
[29:34] we never want to be in that state
[29:39] this young man was a good man
[29:43] brother brown is the only one that i
[29:45] know of that would tie this young man
[29:48] to the rich man in luke chapter 16
[29:52] where jesus would begin to speak of a
[29:54] certain he says there was a
[29:56] certain man and in the scripture when he
[29:58] says there's a certain man
[29:59] it really happened in my opinion so
[30:03] this rich this rich young ruler wasn't
[30:06] willing
[30:07] to surrender himself he had to keep hold
[30:11] of what he what he thought he was
[30:13] but then of course it didn't satisfy his
[30:15] heart
[30:16] so the only thing he knew was to build
[30:19] and gain more money
[30:20] and do the do that kind of thing
[30:24] but there came a time in his life where
[30:27] his
[30:28] riches meant nothing he thought finally
[30:32] my soul can rest
[30:33] who knows the story he said so so why is
[30:37] he saying his sulking rest he says
[30:39] finally i found satisfaction for that
[30:40] hunger in my soul
[30:43] but then when he thought he had found
[30:46] rest
[30:48] his soul was required of him
[30:51] and so what he thought he was you know
[30:53] what
[30:54] what is really going to matter at the
[30:55] end of the day
[30:57] is he there when when when this heart
[31:00] stops beating
[31:02] when this stop my last breath leaves my
[31:04] body should i die
[31:07] there's a doorway called death that we
[31:10] all must walk through
[31:12] is he there to catch me or is he not
[31:15] going to catch me
[31:17] those are the two options he'll either
[31:20] catch me
[31:20] and carry me through or i'm gonna fall
[31:26] and this rich man
[31:30] died and he lost everything
[31:37] why are you talking about these things
[31:40] we're about to take the lord's supper
[31:44] we don't want this to be a family
[31:46] tradition we can hide behind singing
[31:48] behind music
[31:49] even behind preaching we can hide behind
[31:51] so many things
[31:53] but what's really on the inside of the
[31:54] inside of us we can reason a lot of
[31:57] things we can explain even our own
[31:58] stayed away no doubt the root general
[32:00] explained it away to himself tried to
[32:02] find peace i'm okay
[32:03] i'm a good person i can use this money
[32:05] to help the church i can do this and
[32:07] this and whatever more
[32:08] you know i'll have greater influence in
[32:09] my community if i keep my riches
[32:12] it didn't help him
[32:16] no doubt even at his death or maybe it
[32:18] is burial many would have gathered
[32:21] many would have gathered and they would
[32:23] have stood up and maybe gave great
[32:24] speeches of
[32:25] of the things this man did
[32:29] but where he was where he found himself
[32:32] he was alone
[32:35] this is why this is not joining a church
[32:38] this message is not joining a church
[32:40] it's not writing your name
[32:42] on a book it's not becoming a group of
[32:44] people this is not what christianity
[32:45] really is
[32:47] it's meeting the lord it's walking with
[32:49] him
[32:50] this is what this this message came that
[32:52] we would walk with jesus
[32:54] and that's not a catchphrase that's a
[32:55] reality
[32:57] he found himself alone
[33:00] and he was in torment and no one could
[33:04] help him in that place
[33:06] loneliness is of hell we don't have to
[33:10] be alone in this life
[33:14] he's our guide he's our companion you
[33:16] feel lonely in this life that's satan
[33:20] but there's another man called lazarus
[33:24] he is a poor man
[33:28] but he he found himself in abraham's
[33:30] bosom
[33:31] to me i believe he would have heard
[33:33] jesus
[33:34] and he didn't have a lot of reasoning to
[33:36] try and hide behind he said well i'm a
[33:38] poor man what else do i have
[33:40] and that's to me a man of great wisdom
[33:43] who can
[33:44] who can recognize what is this life this
[33:46] life means nothing really
[33:48] it's not even real it's a vapor there
[33:51] won't be that many years gone by we
[33:52] won't be here
[33:53] maybe it'll just be our children of the
[33:55] lord should terry or our grandchildren
[33:56] that'll be it we'll be gone
[33:58] and then where will we be
[34:02] then so
[34:07] see it's not what we can do
[34:11] this man this rich man said what can i
[34:14] do to inherit eternal life
[34:17] it's not what you can do it's what you
[34:19] surrender to
[34:21] the woman at the well wasn't given a
[34:22] bunch of have you been keeping these
[34:24] that's right she just said we know where
[34:26] messiah cometh
[34:28] the prostitute with the alabaster box
[34:31] she didn't
[34:31] she wasn't asked have you been keeping
[34:33] the law have you been a good little girl
[34:34] no she just gave her all
[34:35] [Music]
[34:37] now i want to say there's a line as i
[34:39] said there's a line between mercy and
[34:41] judgment
[34:42] and this rich man crossed the line
[34:44] between mercy
[34:45] and judgment what does that mean he
[34:47] crossed the line that he couldn't
[34:48] receive mercy anymore
[34:49] didn't matter how long he lived on the
[34:51] earth everything good he did
[34:52] he crossed the line he turned down
[34:56] mercy for the last time
[35:00] you say well this isn't very happy this
[35:02] is sobering
[35:05] but i want to maybe finish with this
[35:07] there's a line
[35:10] between judgment and mercy
[35:13] and there is a people upon the earth
[35:15] that
[35:16] cannot cross from mercy
[35:19] into judgment but you have to be in
[35:22] it's not just on your journey well you
[35:24] know god's working with me i'm on my
[35:26] journey
[35:27] don't just be on the journey get in
[35:30] those who had to run to the city of
[35:31] refuge they won't say well just
[35:34] enjoy the journey and i'm enjoying the
[35:36] journey to ram off gilead or wherever no
[35:38] they didn't care about the journey but
[35:39] when they saw the gates
[35:41] they'd just well that was a nice hill at
[35:42] all god's dealing with me hearing all
[35:44] this they just wanted in the city
[35:46] hallelujah and when they were in then
[35:47] they could let off the pressure say i'm
[35:49] safe
[35:50] i'm safe i'm safe what kind of journey
[35:53] were you on i don't care i got here
[35:56] this is what i was interested in amen as
[35:59] the same thing with you and i
[36:01] forget the journey people all about it
[36:04] you know enjoy the moment
[36:05] experience the journey live the journey
[36:07] whatever forget the journey just get in
[36:10] amen it's the destination that matters
[36:13] because once you cross into the city of
[36:15] refuge
[36:17] i wouldn't want to leave you imagine
[36:19] there was a avenger of blood on my trail
[36:21] because of some accident you know didn't
[36:23] mean to do and he could have he had the
[36:24] legal right to kill
[36:26] me and i get into that city and now i'm
[36:28] safe
[36:29] do you think i'm going to walk out those
[36:30] gates no way
[36:33] there was one that did his name was
[36:35] abner
[36:37] david said he died like a full
[36:43] we don't want to fall into that category
[36:47] but those who are sealed into the
[36:48] kingdom
[36:50] they have crossed the line
[36:53] they can't be judged
[37:04] john 5.
[37:08] verily verily i say unto you he that
[37:11] heareth my word
[37:13] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[37:15] everlasting life
[37:17] and shall not come into condemnation
[37:19] that's the judgment
[37:21] that is passed from death into life
[37:28] they've passed they can't come to the
[37:30] judgment
[37:32] this scripture is a bride scripture not
[37:35] those who are just on their journey
[37:36] israel was on a journey but the older
[37:38] generation didn't make the journey
[37:40] because of because of unbelief
[37:46] this may be seem very elementary tonight
[37:49] but if you've really
[37:52] been given faith which is a revelation
[37:59] no no but god's anchored his word in
[38:01] your heart and he's changed your life
[38:04] he's changed your life to me this is you
[38:09] he that believeth on him that sent me
[38:11] hath everlasting life
[38:13] and shall not come and shall not
[38:16] come into condemnation but is passed
[38:19] from death
[38:20] unto life
[38:25] we don't want to take this casually
[38:28] what a tremendous thing i'm just i'm
[38:31] really just going to leave it like that
[38:33] but i just want you to think about it
[38:34] because this is an examination time
[38:38] am i in the faith do i really know him
[38:43] have i made everything right i need to
[38:44] make right
[38:46] do i hold anything against anyone have i
[38:48] forgiven them
[38:49] you know has everything been put right
[38:52] or am i just doing this because mum and
[38:54] dad do and this one does as a tradition
[38:59] we don't want to be rich young this
[39:00] message will produce some rich young
[39:02] rulers
[39:04] but you don't have to stay that way are
[39:06] you following me
[39:08] we don't want to just be good church
[39:09] people we want to know him
[39:18] let's just let's just stand tonight
[39:21] shall we
[39:27] if anyone wants to be remembered in
[39:28] prayer let's just bow heads all together
[39:30] shall we
[39:31] if you all want to be remembered in
[39:32] prayer tonight from what's been said i
[39:34] just want to raise your hand to the lord
[39:37] lord jesus you see the hands that are
[39:40] raised lord

[39:47] lord jesus that's one thing we don't
[39:49] want to hear
[39:51] one thing they'll lack us lord like the
[39:54] rich young ruler he wasn't willing to
[39:58] give up that thing he lacked lord he
[40:00] wasn't willing
[40:02] but lord i pray o god that
[40:06] should we hear that those words now
[40:10] lord you're not a god of confusion that
[40:11] we have to try and work things out
[40:14] lord you are a still small voice lord
[40:17] you
[40:17] speak to our hearts you prick our
[40:19] conscience lord you show us things that
[40:21] if we haven't given them to you or
[40:23] haven't made things right lord you bring
[40:25] it to our hearts oh god
[40:27] lord i don't know the hearts of the
[40:28] people but you know our hearts oh god
[40:31] lord i just pray oh lord if there's
[40:33] anyone here that lacketh

[40:40] moment lord
[40:41] dear god may they not hold on to it and
[40:43] reason your way
[40:45] but lord may they just give it to you
[40:48] lord jesus i just want to pray lord for
[40:51] your mercy
[40:53] lord we know that there is a line
[40:56] between mercy and judgment where a
[40:58] person can cross that line and
[41:00] mercy is no more available for them but
[41:03] lord there's
[41:04] and i pray dear god that may no one be
[41:08] tipping across that line even now or
[41:10] skirting around it or near it lord
[41:13] but father i pray lord as there is
[41:15] another line that that that we can cross
[41:18] which is a line between judgment and
[41:20] mercy
[41:21] where we can be sealed into your kingdom
[41:23] by your holy spirit lord
[41:25] where you can come and dwell on us lord
[41:27] it takes a life given
[41:29] it takes a full surrender lord jesus a
[41:31] real repentance lord
[41:32] but it takes you to do that lord it's
[41:35] the goodness your goodness that leadeth
[41:36] to repentance my god
[41:38] it's your goodness it leads to a full
[41:40] surrender
[41:41] so dear god i just pray for each one
[41:43] here
[41:44] lord if there's anyone here lord jesus
[41:47] no doubt by the number that's in the
[41:48] room and the ages we have lord no doubt
[41:50] there's some lord that are
[41:51] on their journey but lord may they not
[41:54] continue on the journey
[41:56] lord isn't just walking and you're
[41:57] dealing but lord may they just meet you
[41:59] o lord may they come to their
[42:00] destination oh god
[42:02] and be sealed into the kingdom by your

[43:05] hearts
[43:06] lord that you have risen out of history
[43:09] lord to take us from this world

[43:13] those days from

[43:24] lord jesus
[43:26] lord i just pray dear god may you
[43:29] may bless the service now for your glory
[43:32] lord in jesus christ's name
[43:34] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[43:38] have your seats we're just going to go
[43:39] to
[43:40] first corinthians 11 now we're just
[43:42] going to read the scripture
[44:04] so we're going to go to verse 23 of
[44:06] first corinthians 11.
[44:09] he says for i have received of the lord
[44:11] that which also i deliver unto you
[44:14] that the lord jesus the same night in
[44:16] which he was betrayed took bread
[44:18] and when he had given thanks he break it
[44:20] and said take eat this is my body
[44:22] which is broken for you this do
[44:26] add me in remembrance of me
[44:29] after the same manner also he took the
[44:31] cup when he had sup
[44:33] saying this cup is the new testament in
[44:35] my blood
[44:37] this do ye as offers you drink it in
[44:38] remembrance of me
[44:40] for as often as you eat this bread and
[44:42] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[44:44] death till he come
[44:46] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[44:48] and drink this cup of the lord
[44:50] unworthily
[44:51] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[44:53] the lord but let a man
[44:54] examine himself and so let him eat of
[44:58] that bread and drink of that cup
[45:00] for he that drinketh sorry he that
[45:02] eateth and drinketh unworthily
[45:04] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[45:06] not discerning the lord's body
[45:08] for this cause many are weakened sickly
[45:10] among you and many
[45:12] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[45:15] should not be judged
[45:17] but when we are judged we are chastened
[45:19] of the lord
[45:20] that we should not be condemned with the
[45:23] world
[45:24] wherefore my brethren when ye come
[45:25] together to eat carry one for another
[45:28] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[45:30] home that ye come not together unto
[45:32] condemnation
[45:34] and the rest will i sit in order when i
[45:36] come
[45:38] amen so as brother braham said this is a
[45:40] showdown time
[45:41] is everything right with the lord has
[45:42] everything been made fine
[45:45] so we're going to just pray for the
[45:46] bread and the wine we know that these
[45:48] are not the literal blood
[45:49] blood and body of our lord jesus it's
[45:51] just element representation of them
[45:53] brother queben are you going to you're
[45:54] going to come forward or brother
[45:56] which one of you could you just come
[45:58] forward brother eden we'll
[45:59] pray for these and and then we're just
[46:02] going to pray and then when you as you
[46:04] feel to there's no hurry
[46:06] come forward you may receive the lord's
[46:12] supper
[46:17] amen so they should still stand once
[46:20] again sorry for
[46:21] a certain stand bliss'll stand delicious
[46:23] bowel heads

[46:29] that you paid for our sin amen what a
[46:32] price might go off

[46:37] lord we didn't force you to do it but
[46:39] lord because love constrained you my god
[46:41] love for adam's fallen race lord jesus
[46:44] that you'd redeem us back to yourself

[46:47] lord you're mad more than any man but
[46:49] lord yet it was a joy set before you
[46:52] lord which was us redeemed around your
[46:54] throne so lord we thank you we can have

[47:03] bow our heads in thanksgiving
[47:05] and lord i just pray father may you
[47:07] bless this bread oh god

[47:11] man o lord we thank you lord jesus that
[47:14] your
[47:14] body was given for us oh god lord and
[47:17] also this wine oh god

[47:21] what a blood that you had
[47:23] the blood of god what a what a
[47:25] purchasing price you paid
[47:27] or there couldn't be any other price you
[47:29] ever paid in creation
