the guitar [Music] god bless you um praise the lord it's so good to be here and just a wonderful presence you know it shows people that really know their god there's an atmosphere that comes you know and i believe and i can say it's here tonight um this song is called stand still and let god move and it was on my heart this week um you know it's not always easy but praise the lord getting there you know just i believe that's the key actually is to let god move you know and um the song i don't know who wrote it but there's some extra verses been added obviously since after the covert 19. and um and i'm thinking of you know the prophet spoke about when he was in germany that time and he saw a painting and it's called the cloud land and from a far distance it looks like a real horrible sight it's gloomy and dark and it's not until you walk right up on it that you see it's actually angel's wings they are shouting hallelujah he says so sometimes it's like that for us it might be gloomy it might be dark but we just need to draw so much closer to him and be certain of god and then we can see his own angels in disguise so praise the lord that's our god he's the one that created all things [Music] the father has a plan though it's hard to see it now i feel you walking all alone he is there no doubt when the storm around your ages and you're tossed to and fro when you're faced with life's decisions and not sure which way to go stand still watch god move standing still is hard to do when you feel you have reached the earth he'll make a way for you stand still and not good moves the enemy surrounds you and the wars are closing in when the tide is swiftly rising and you wonder where he's been there has never been a moment that is arms when reaching out you can rest assured and be secure god is moving right now stand [Music] standing still is hard to do standing still and watch good news many are afraid don't know what to do [Music] they panicking despair as this plague is moving through but a precious pride of christ he says to you don't you fear just the blood the token is given [Music] standing still [Music] stand still [Music] remember back in genesis the earth without forming void and darkness was upon him everything had died remember how god moved he brought it back to life spoke into existence let there be light stand [Music] still and watch still is hard to do when you feel your average seal he'll make a way for [Music] see how they panicked and cried saw the egyptians coming and so they all would die but then the prophet moses cried today you see them no more see the salvation of your god fear not just stand still [Music] it's not a storm it's only angels it's a blessing in [Music] little disguise watch god move for there's a man here who can turn on the light so stand still and watch god amen there's a man here that can turn on the light hey man you know i know it amen god bless you sisters thank you for the song what a blessing eh

evening so we just thank you for that lord jesus just bless each one that's streaming and yeah just um we just want to commit the service to your hands tonight in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you all just as you're standing let's go to matthew 16 verse 3 and then you can have your seats after that thank you musicians matthew 16 verse 3 says the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting him that he would show them a sign from heaven he answered and said unto them when in this evening it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you can but can you not discern the signs of the times amen my little bless is where you can take your seats um this uh this evening okay do we have a little tissue here i don't have covered but i've just got a runny nose so i've got quite a lot to get through this evening it's not really a lot but just but i'm going to go through it quite fast but as i always say you look like a very intelligent bunch of people to me so so i'm just going to run through this it's really fast um and i'm what i'm going to say is i believe it to be the truth it's very simple thought it's not it's not anything that is going to be out of left field or anything i don't have the capacity to do that not that intelligent but it's going to be truth but i'll just go around a few different areas um around this but i'm not going to be afraid to speak it the way that i think that it is and i think i'm in the company that will understand that's what i'm trying to do you know so some of it could be deemed highly offensive but it doesn't matter because if it's the truth it's the truth right it doesn't now you'll see what i mean when i get through to different parts of it but but you'll know what i you'll understand what i'm saying when i get to it because it's just we can't be afraid just to speak the things as they are right but um and it's a little bit political but i'm but i am not going to be passionate about anything because i'm not political these days or i am for the kingdom of god you know so so that's what i'm going to get passionate about but other political stuff i don't i really have no time for because i see satan as involved in all of it okay so i'm i'm i'm very very over it all now let's get this going so once i start i'm gonna go very fast is that right okay cool thank you okay my sermon tonight is nothing new to you you're going to know what i'm talking about it's very easy it's called uniting time but this is front page news this was preached in back in the 60s but this is front page news what it's happening right now and con and i guess the the the things i'm going to touch on the communism denominationalism and the bride so now i've got this this idea of communism you know when we think of communism we often just think of um russia or china and this funny little thing that we've a lot of us here have had nothing to do with communism essentially in these western countries that we know of but brother branham his idea of when he talks about communism is not just to do with that it's to do with evil this godless evil force is what he's talking about you can't just refer it to i haven't seen any russians over here attacking us therefore communism isn't having an effect on us we've got to understand what he's meaning by communism he's talking about there's a spirit which is just an ungodly spirit he just calls it communism but it's not so much you know if they're not russian or chinese then don't worry about it sort of thing but i just want to run through these things about communism this is from a communist question of confession of faith um questions this is from you know karl marx he was him and another guy they sort of formed this idea of communism right he was german are you a communist yes to say he would answer right question two a question when are you a communist yes question two what is the aim of the communist answer to organize society in such a way that every member of it can develop and use all its capabilities and powers and complete freedom and without thereby infringing on the basic conditions of the society good question three how do you wish to achieve this aim answer by the elimination of private property and its replacement by community of property property so this is now communism right now the idea of it is very actually actually very good this if that was all there was it's a good idea that's not all just one person hoard everything that shield around everyone has you know gets to use all the stuff and it's a very it's a very good idea and i've got a quote from brother branham saying that same thing he said well communism is right you know the idea is right but not forced like that russia communism is only a revival of the devil like pentecost said pentecost had real communism everybody sold everything freely and divided among them so the early church were actually communists they had everything in common that's the truth because acts 2 44 says and all that believed and all that belief were together and all had all things in common right communism and they sold their possessions of goods and parted them to all men as if men had need right then that's a very good idea we may get back to that that's the way they were right another verse here and neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according to as he had need communist socialist there you go very good okay now and brother and says i made the statement in the federal court so i said if communism had christianity in it i'd be a communist okay because the principle is very good right but i can't be because it denies christianity is there anything wrong with it right now now that keep in mind this thought here hijacking a good cause for evil intent because i've got to i'm going to come back to this thought later on and this is what satan does all the way through and i'm gonna touch on on a current affair that's happening to to point this out to you but you'll see when i get there so now um if we go through to the next question this is down down the line a bit question 22 was do communists reject existing religions answer all religions which have existed hitherto were expressions of historical stages of development of individual peoples or groups of peoples but communism is that stage of historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous and supersedes them so essentially saying when you get to the point of communism of this this brand of communism then all religion all god everything is out of the picture you no longer need that it's done away with and that's that's always been the driving force behind communism it's it's godless you know we we can do without god we don't need god right that's the and that's that's the motivation that that that drives this thing and brother brown says here so now he's starting to get onto the idea of communism the way that he's describing it see that great intellectual that we all so hold to what's communism today what is their god it's the intellectual science what are we doing anyhow um where are we living consider these words today so he's saying it's when he talks communist he's talking about this evil godless smart educated group you know that that's what he's saying it is now we find out that he sprayed this poison spray and that spray was a spray of modern understanding education science and the civilization the very things that we cherish so much did you ever stop to think that our great enemy and the natural life today among the nations is communism what is the god of communism civilization and education science that's right isn't it that's what they live on and thrive on it's science scientific sciences the god of science now if you adjust with the poison spray of modern civilization science and education so now when he's talking communism that's what he's talking about not so much russia and china if you understand what i mean he's saying there's a driving godless spirit behind us okay um and then he's one so then in the 30s or 40s he says during the prophecy actually before that he said there will be three great isms communism fascism and nazism he said they'll wind up in one ism and that ism will dominate the world and will burn the vatican city and you remember me saying that years and years and years ago in just exactly that way so he's saying communism is going to be the ism that will eventually dominate to destroy the catholic the catholic church okay now i'm just going to touch on a few of the places where communism took hold and see if it actually did a great job or not but how can you with a godless mentality right so so um these guys here vladimir lenin he was inspired by it there these guys start off as socialists and they take on this they read they read the books they read karl marx's writings and they think that's going to be a great idea so this guy in a political sense he did quite well vladimir lenin to eventually end up ruling russia he fought a hard fight to get there and then so then he wanted to bring his idea of communism into to russia and once he died then joseph stalin carried on the idea they were they were working together so um and they implemented you know communism according to karl marx with the the slight variance of it but essentially um that's what they did but they it involved a lot of change and it evolved adjusting things and and it was very bad for the country um so this is the outcome of communism in that place that i'll just read this this just there's a there were a lot of bad things but this is one that month stalin and yoshi have signed order number zero zero four four seven listing 268 950 people for a rest of whom 79 950 were executed he also initiated national operations the ethnic cleansing of soviet of non-soviet ethnic groups among them poles germans latvians finns greeks koreans and chinese through internal or external exile during these years approximately 1.6 million were arrested seven and seven hundred thousand were shot in an unknown number died under nkvd torture so you're talking about a million people killed for different to for this cause so that's that's the outcome of communism there however i've just got this interesting quote that i just threw in here brother adam says but everyone tells you we hear a lot of propaganda that russia's all communists and you go in there don't you believe that nonsense there's millions of christians in russia well you know that russia there's only one percent of russia in the whole there's communists that's government statistics one percent what russia needs is a revival they need meat of god to stand out with something real it's amazing how these guys got into power when there's so few of them because it was actually and i found this other statistic here this is obviously statistics now but there is no official census of religion and russian estimates are based on surveys according to a 2012 street arena survey 46.6 percent of the russian population is christian including 41 russian orthodox however later that year the levada center determined that 76 of russians are christians and in june 2013 public opinion foundation determined that 65 of russians then another one determined there's about 77 percent so so these guys were all saying that there's about there's about 78 70 of russians are christians even though it's a communist country right so so maybe back when in the 50s fought when brother brown was talking about it there was even a lot more proportion of christians there not that that means anything for this but now i want to carry on we see our world at bankruptcy we see communism sweeping in an ungodly spirit called the iron curtain which was russia that spirit coming in there we see one rising under in china called the bamboo curtain and we see one rise called the purple curtain the roman curtain taking over the world now you gotta understand this is the 50s when these these movements were in the height of their power when when there was a lot of killing and a lot of that sort of stuff were going on and during this time so this this was a big deal in the 50s and because because now we'll go to this one you had and china at the same time you had mao zedong and china bringing in communism to to china and the results were similar to what the results they had in russia and i'll just read you some of the stuff um this is a 55 to 57 you know we hear other sermons from 55 this is from 57 well at the same time this is happening in china mao launched the super movement and the anti-rightist campaign with at least 550 000 people persecuted in the latter most affirmative intellectuals and dissidents in 1958 he launched the great leap forward which turned out to be a great leap backward that aimed to rapidly transform china's economy from agrarian to industrial which led to the deadliest famine in history in the deaths of 20 to 46 million people in 1958 and 1962 so during those years he listened to the sermons 20 milli 20 to 40 million chinese starved to death because of a famine because of this effects of trying to bring communism this certain idea into a country and then in 63 male launched the socialist education movement and in 66 he initiated initiated the cultural revolution a program to remove counter-revolutionary elements in chinese society which lasted ten years it was marked by violent class struggle widespread destruction of cultural artefacts and unprecedented elevation of mao's cult of personality tens of millions of people were persecuted during the revolution well the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions no one knows how many died but there were a lot um at that time okay so now this is what's happening in the timeline brother and i'm speaking this and so i've just got a few quote series is all of our subjects is on communism beat communism out i hear it until i get sick of listening to it i'm against it too certainly i'm against it because everyone all the preachers are preaching about this got this bad communism but he's saying i'm more against the man or woman that rejects christ the word or whether you be a preacher or whatever you are you are more indebted to christ than to the communist he is ignorant and knows nothing about it you're supposed to know see you can discern the time of communism but you can't discern the sign of the day you're living in because at the time that was you know it was there it was everything what's the matter with the preachers today this is in 62. um communism every preacher is out there trying to fight communism he says communism nothing the thing the devil is weaving right under your nose and you don't know it is romanism denominationalism and rome is the mother of denominations the bible says she was a [ __ ] and her daughters were harlots against god against his word okay for the hour is coming when communism is swallowing them countries up and they'll not be privileged to preach the gospel because it does away with god that's what mel did actually in that that time too he shut down all the churches so you couldn't have any churches from the 60s to the 70s there were no no churches at all not even the three south church i don't think which is the official um chinese one for the hours coming well com when communism is sweeping them countries up and they'll not be privileged to preach the gospel while the door is open may every missionary minor person either go or support someone that can go so china was a funny place like that in a funny way because after the um i think when mao died in about the 80s it did open up they had economic reforms and the country opened up you know into the sort of 2000s it slowly opened up to where um i think they were more interested in making money than controlling what religion was doing so there's been a period it's coming to an end now but there has been a period where religion was eased up on you know you could there were a lot of home churches and the um what were they just not official there was a government official government church but there were a lot of home churches they they went on without any problems you know some of these churches were 1500 people big you know they just carried on they weren't an official church they were it was against the law but no one seemed to care because they were making money who cares about this whole thing it's changing now it's going back to the way it used to be like there's a there's a big crack down at the moment now on religion and on all these home churches like this church here they now meet they had i think 1500 people but they now meet um on riverbanks and things because they their churches have been shut down and this is i think that this is another one the police are always out the front of the building where the churches and they've closed the church this was maybe another thousand people in this church but there's at the moment it's going the other way so the this the there's a push to stop these churches operating okay and don't ever underestimate satan's power of deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's smooth as can be and the antichrist spirit isn't communism so as bad as this whole thing appears he's saying it's not that's not that's not the antichrist spirit that that he's that he's fighting against anyway all right the united states will come to a time that church and state will unite together and the protestant and catholic will throw their things together to fight communism and that's exactly playing into the hands of what god said right here okay he says the next one great big evangelical church of the protestants will cooperate and join them with catholicism to combat communism right so now he's starting to say this is what's going to happen is we're going to see this as the big evil and the churches are going to combine together and to fight off this evil okay so now this is where we might get controversial but but i want to point out some of the modern day events that are happening to to understand there's a force that's happening we're in a very very vicious war at the moment and it's only going to get worse and the war is spewing out into the open it's a it's a it's a we've got to know where we stand in this war otherwise we're going to get sucked into this whole thing but let me tell you it's a raging war you there's never been there will never be a war like this again on the face of the earth because it's going to be a global war of ideas and it's going to play out in different places and the bride needs to know what's going on where do we stand where do we fight you see because we can easily get caught up in a war that we're not supposed to be have any part of right so right so just i want to bring this on so now we're going to get this idea of hijacking a good cause for evil intent once again right okay so i know you're something that that um well this is my next blm and communism how i want to show you this is not the only place where communism is coming in but it's coming in this is just the most current affair so it's front page news but it's been happening for a long time news media everything that's been coming in from all angles people are people like believers not believers christians are now starting to wake up to it and think wow there's a spaghetti coming in all around me i've got to fight back that's what's happening at the moment there's a war brewing massive massive war brewing huge global war and rome is actually going to win for an hour and dominate but and but it's a massive war and it's amazing what's happening at the moment it's such an exciting time to be living in because this was spoken in the 60s and we can basically read a script and say this is what's going to happen and we can watch it and we we read the news we see it all playing out we think well this is exactly what brother evan said would happen right so now here if you can read that now this is brother i'm speaking i've told you here in this pulpit martin luther king is the greatest independent the color people ever had right that man's going to lead a thousand of them to a slaughter that's right inspired by communism let me prove my point i said that about two years ago look what's happening right now um they said they were fighting for integration and when the law gave them integration new people that don't believe in integration be ashamed of you our nation permits integration and we should do what the big boss says that's exactly right and now you say now to come to places and so forth like that is shopping and sit in the back of the bus and so forth no sir the lord says he just the same as we are so we're the same as they are so let's act that way let's be that way and that's exactly what all the really true born again people believe and now i believe that's in their heart right now now this is straightforward stuff this is like like a christian a born-again christian doesn't think like that right it's like saying if i let the keys to brother so-and-so to pick something up from the church you know i don't know brother you might steal things from the church you know it's like hey come on the guy's a believer you know thou shalt not steal he's not going to steal things the second commandment is uh they also love their neighbor as itself you know if you're a believer your neighbor is whoever's next to you no matter what color they are that that's how the christian operates right so so there's no need to to try and oh i've got a lot of this sort of friend that's free off i'm not like that believers aren't like that full stop you know they won't get past the the chastisement of the holy ghost if they've got that wrong mentality right so that that's so say look just to get that aside that they say that that's what it is but to still approach it in a in a way it carries on well now what is it now to show you this is the movement back in the 60s now to show you that it's communism and not them colored people say it's an idea but it's been hijacked by this idea of communism that that's how communism has always come in to take over they do that in every nation that's how they do it getting you fighting amongst one another revolution and they take in without a shot they don't want to block the country they want it they can wound weed it in and now they've seen a case of doing that and now what your revolution was they thought they'd start another revolution be saying they're coming in from a different they're hijacking a and an agenda that is a good agenda but they're hijacking it for a an evil intention right okay so let me know i've got these few this is one of the co-founders of the blm movement and i've got a little quote that she said you probably can't read that at the bottom but it says that we actually do have she's just speaking speaking of speech we actually do have an ideological frame myself and alicia which was the co-founders of an actual movement not just an idea but a movement like an organization at trained organizers we are trained marxists we are supervised on that so she's saying she's saying we are communist we are trained marxists you know from karl marx that so this is not a secret right right so now here's oh that was the next part of the quote right just to show you the battle that's that's going on that it's this is a battle of this is a spiritual a created spiritual battle it okay this is what's happening and just this is just one instance but it's happening in every area of life every area of life right and i've got these two guys up here this is a um this was an interview on cnn now people joke about cnn you know it's called cable news network but people joke around say it's communist news network you know because it's well known that okay they're from the left sort of communist side and they're fighting against this way and other organizations are this way and that's how this is all unfolding right um and so one of the the guys on cnn is saying that uh they're trying to shut down the other guy because he's saying i don't agree with this movement it's wrong and because he's a he's more of a conservative right they're both the same they should both be going for the same thing but one is talking but they're they're not arguing on whether the ideal itself is right they're arguing on the direction they're both coming from in a spiritual sense do you understand now so that so that the caption under here was very good that it says so what is black lives matter really about this now this is just facts of what people are thinking right many conservatives and such black lives matter as a marxist anti-police racial organization that wants to tear down america meanwhile most liberals simply view black lives matter as a heroic movement and powerful slogan signaling support for racial justice and opposition to police brutality and he says both are right there's black lives matter trademark organization and then there's black lives matter as a as a good idea right right and so but they're both coming so they're both right but they're both both ideas of who they are right but it depends what side they're coming from okay you understand that that makes sense right so they put it well now and now there's because these narratives that get pushed that don't like to be exposed like like like these guys are totally against these are conservative guys you know they don't look like they should be conservative but they're conservatives and they're against the the movement because they can see the the nature that it is in their opinion right they're saying this is an evil intended uh communist movement we're against it and anyone that's conservative christian in this time a lot of them are forming this sort of camp right and so these guys they will play this video of like they say look there's here's these black lives matter people processing outside of church and screaming at people why are you serving god and why are you going to church in that he's saying what's that got to do with the policemen up the road you know in the end you know and this and you've got races on both sides that you've got the guy and the and the tires goes to the church you know why are you going to church you should be ashamed of yourself and you know and then you've got the you know little babe kids walking past and the guy's yelling at his megaphone this little kid you know it's it's it's he's saying hang on this is this is more than just a you know what's going on here right now i'm just saying this is as information right so you can get the idea of this war that's brewing between a lot of a lot of factions and i want to show you we we're not supposed to be part of it it's very very it's a which i'll show you what camp we're in in a little bit but i just want to read you some of these quotes right because this is now what's what's starting to happen in the world are people are in their opinion waking up to this evil you know but they're not really waking up to it they've been sucked into it right it's it's amazing what's happening we've known this for a long time now here's some of the comments hey correct me if i'm wrong but isn't that religious persecution shouldn't that count as a hate crime you know doing that and and someone else anyone else getting tired of someone else straight up demons are coming after christians once again history repeats itself another quote it's a marxist movement destroying history and religion to have their former government establish communist socialists beyond heartbreaking seeing the nation being hijacked right now i'm not saying that person's right to said that but i'm saying there's this movement to understand what's happening because they're saying there's this big communist movement happening and we've got to stand up against it right this is a war this is actual war that we're involved in and it's kind of getting it's getting you don't even want to keep up with it because it's crazy like this lady here is a police chief in seattle seattle they've had riots and stuff like that and you know abolish the police and all that kind of stuff and she's saying and the police chief which is actually an african-american woman resigned she said i can't do this anymore i've had enough this is just there's no respect for the police i'm resigning this is a you know as a result of a movement that's supposed to be for her you know and making a resign and she's saying she's saying the problem is you guys are cutting the funding to the police force this is in the article and now we've hired a whole lot of new police that are minority groups and that to come in and to increase the diversity of our police force and now we have to lay them all off see what's the point of this now now that you can see there's another intention behind this this movement which is not just this it's not limited to this it's all over the place but you get what i'm saying this is just the current one i don't think i uh yeah i'll read this because this is just now people's commentary on the situation right this is mrs cullers is one of the founders that said she was a marxist as unapologetic in describing black lives matter founders as trained marxists so it's worth examining the words that inspire their deeds marxism the 19th century worldview system systemized by german revolutionary karl marx is fundamentally atheistic when you know god it subscribes to a theory that matter physical stuff compromises the fundamental reality of human existence the transcendent experiences of the human heart are regarded as nothing more than biochemistry like there's no god there's none of that fantasies of brain function stuff whether molecule or man is just soulless stuff and short matter doesn't really matter you know we're just nothing we come from nobody who cares that's saying that's his idea now this is where this is where the war starts raging right clearly marxism stands in diametric opposition to the judo christian foundation of america or this you know which views each person is infused with a spirit abounded by time and space a manifestation of an omnipotent creator human lives matter all of them a belief under good and the american founding in the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed with their by their credit or certain unalienable rights these among that among them are life liberty and their pursuit of happiness right so they're saying these these two thoughts are at opposing ends of the scale this is this these will be non non-christian people essentially saying this it's not this is not a christian view this is a you know what i'm saying but i just wanted to put it out there for right too but to show you that the fight is all over the place and it's been created to this left and right fight right and that's that's that's evil it's of satan like like you the the camps have been separated to create a big division because we are i'm left and i'm right i believe i'm a socialist communist as far as they're good and i'm this way but but i can't be a i can't be a left-leaning person without him i have to support like uh um abortion i'm expected to support that and then be against god you know but i'm like hang on i i don't support their support these other things but then see how you get put in camps and that's what's been trying to happen as you get put in camp you go to the right i believe in some of those principles but where they are too hard on people and they actually they are not correct in their view and they are actually racist and evil i'm against that view you know but it's like if you go there you have to subscribe to all that you know it's but that's what's been happening right that's and it's playing out on the open stage it's not this is not a secret anymore and so this is the sort of thing that that these powers are and this is why people are kind of getting the message or they're engaging in this battle these are quotes that probably wouldn't get heard of 20 years ago 15 years ago but here's a here's a president of a country attacking another you know the guy that's going to try to take his job and he's saying mr trump who is invited himself as a presbyterian said of mr biden which is the you know you've got this right and left christian non-christian evil force and christian guys coming here to head so what does trump say he says this guy is going to take away your guns destroy a second amendment no religion hurt the bible hurt god he's against god he's against guns he's against energy our kind of energy so he's clearly saying that we've got this is an evil communist force you know we've got to rise up in the name of god and fight it you know and people are subscribing to this now this is not just a thing of our imagination this is happening right this is a real thing happening we can't say it doesn't because this is existing it's just it's in all sorts of places happening over here too who knows israel he's the he was the australian um rugby player he went he went um one time to express his opinion on facebook and this was his he's a christian guy um warning drunks homosexuals with a dollar is always fornicated saves atheists idolaters hallelujah repent only jesus saves lost his job with the australian rugby union but he he fought back and said no i'm not going to take this and i'm going to make a stand he fought back and got a massive payout from them right now now then he goes and plays for another team overseas and uh then they have this they all sort of take a knee at the at the start of the game and support a black lives matter but see he's now i'm against this whole communist evil force so i won't bow you know i'm a christian and now he's under attack again now see now these people are considered champions off this side now we've got to stand behind this guy you know so then you see all this stuff on social media support this guy you know stand with him you know we're going to fight back against this evil thing you know that's that's what they're all saying you know let's let's fight back against this communist organization you know and he becomes like a hero right don't get caught up in it i'm not going yeah let's fight back with him because we're not fighting against that organization we're not but this is not our fight but i just want to show you this is what's happening this is the world we live in and it's only going to get worse until rome finally rome will win in the end see these guys will start to actually win we now i'm not going to say we but the christian faith will actually start to win and they will eventually win for an hour and then and then and then russia will destroy rome you know that's what's going to happen so so that as dark as what it looks like people think i saw a quote the other day you know christianity america is dead i'm like you don't know what you're talking about christianity is going to win for a short amount of time you know all the dominations everyone's going to band together to fight this evil communist darkness and they're actually going to win and and people see courage like this they see cars like trump standing against they're like we can do this you know we can fight back christians do but don't get caught up in it i shouldn't but just to show just to show you what's actually happening like the the nba is a as a known really left-leaning unapologetic we hate conservatives we hate they're very pro-china you know they're just open about their beliefs and for years it's gone on okay but their viewership now is has dropped by fifty percent from like five million a game two and a half million a game and when you read the comments and this people are saying this because we don't support a communist organization that's trying to come in with all their left-wing ideas so people aren't watching so their ratings are going down by 50 they're saying look if this was a sitcom they'd be cut you know right but this is about a fight this is not about a game this is about a fight of ideas that's what it is it's not it's that's what it's about it's not this is it just spews over in this you know spews over in different places spews over in hollywood spews over everywhere but the the the good guys are fighting back and they're supposedly winning like they're saying ha look at your organization now it's going down you know your viewership's down by 50 we're winning you know and when people win they start to get encouraged and that's what's starting to happen now i'm going to carry on with this pope john wants all the churches to come together to fight communism and god anybody that knows the bible knows god organized communism to kill her with whether it burn burn the [ __ ] that's rome and burn her children are bear to fire sure he's using it just like he did king nebuchadnezzar the protestant churches will unite themselves together and make a council of churches and pentecost write with them why they don't know the word that's exactly the words promising that they're going to unite together to fight communism this evil force that's coming on the world and that's exactly what's happening right and finally will unite this brotherhood not come out as catholic and they'll be united as a brotherhood to try and stamp out communism the evil left you know okay yeah oh what did i do there okay into new zealand so we've got our own fight brewing on our hands right well i don't because i'm not fighting this thing you know i'm not fighting this whole i'm not into this whole cause but we've got something we we have so this is our prime minister and i think she's actually a very strong lady i think she's you know in terms of um i was saying to shannon the other day like in terms of she's she must be going through a lot of troubles and then she has to come out and she talks like she's not you know she's a very strong lady i've got a lot of admiration for her ability to she's done well in her career let's say that she's done very very well you know and you've got to acknowledge people that have done well i think she's very intelligent she's done very well um so this this group here is called the international union of socialist youth it's mainly from all the left-leaning parties around the western world in south africa and different ones are all part of this group and they each year they have different presidents of this international union of socialist youth which goes way back they had a bit of a spat with communism and they kind of split up in the earlier days but they're still that sort of way you know and the president of that in 2008 was jacinda ardern before she came back here and became our prime minister right so now that the the good guys see this and go oh hang on these like the socialists coming in and right that's that's and that and like i said socialism and communism they they're all they're good they're very good principals but they always seem to come with this godless idea like we don't need god you know so that's kind of has to you almost can't be it unless you have that belief you can but it's it's pushed the narrative is pushed that way and that's that's why it's becoming toxic to be involved in anything very toxic everything is toxic every every new avenue is toxic i'm not involved in any of it anymore because it's way too toxic it's just for a believer but a believer is not fighting there anyways i'll show you in a little bit right now i want to say this because this is the world we live in this is the world we live in and this is what we face and this is what our minds have to comprehend on a daily basis this is us people and this and it's only going to get worse it's only going to get worse right so now we're bringing this whole current affair right there's this cover 19 thing now this this has got that con i wouldn't say a conspiracy theorist i'd say the guys that are trying to fight against communism and all that stuff that this has got them like they've they're running red hot you know right right and and and they've got they've got cause too they look at the socialists you know she was she's she was a socialist coming in now she's running the country and so should this like distribution of wealth you know like to cinder's argument for the the last financial crisis was how we're going to fix it all we just redistribute all the wealth and then we'll solve all the problems you know but that's the common which probably might work but now i just want to show you this until it all runs out jersey forecast show that it's definitely not the case they show net new borrowing of 100 this is new zealand's finances now 163 billion over the next five years and so they're saying eventually our deficit is going to get to 200 billion now 11 months ago they're saying it was 60 billion so and in the space of about four years we're going to go from 60 billion of debt to 200 billion that's a massive jump that's like 300 or something in the space of four years they're like oh hang on hang on this is huge what's going on here this is like this is unheard of and unheard of escalation of debt what's going on there's some sort of conspiracy you're trying to ruin the country you know which which could be the intention who knows it may be okay now all this means that a forecast borrowing now they're saying there's no problem with it though because the rates the interest rates on this 1060 billion are low they're they're at two percent you know for the next 10 years so even in 10 years time we're only going to be we're not going to be paying a lot more than what we're paying now because the interest rates have come down even though the borrowing's gone up the interest rates have come down so we're paying three billion now and ten years will only be paying four billion you know rest rest easy everybody never mind the fact they're still trying to bill you know it doesn't matter the interest rates are going to be low you know it's that's you know so their treasury is always easily sustainable you know if it's like we haven't talked about paying it back yet have we gonna do that but i guess it doesn't matter so then this is the next thing so who will lend us the money this is the article who will lend us where we're going to get this money from let me read this to you then there's also demand from our own reserve bank for those bonds government bonds it has just doubled its appetite to 60 billion inside two months and as said it will borrow up to be able to borrow up to 50 of government bonds on issue this implies that the reserve bank still has room to increase its quantitative easing program by another 40 billion to at least 100 billion they believe only 40 billion to be lent by overseas and local investors let me to explain to you what that means we're going to print money we're going to print money like and it's cleverly worded like there's demand from the reserve bank you meet them what are they getting for their buck they're just oh look we decided we're going to print some money and buy some of your bonds you know you give us an iu we'll give you the money you know and where that demand came from i don't know like we don't need it we're not getting anything for our money we're going to print money and you know there's demand there's no demand it's like we're just going to print money and we're going to print we're going to print 100 billion because quantitative easing means i'm going to print money and lend it to you that's what it means right they're just that's that's that's the it's that's a flash word for and we all know that does it creates inflation and makes your dollar worth less and all the rest of it right cares don't worry about it it's just what's happening there don't get all stressed bring it on print some more throw it out there you know yeah the younger generations of voters are entering a world see if i was of this camp i'd be like we've got to fight this because they're ruining the country they're ruining our god society and you know ruin it who cares it's gone it's not our fight it's gone it's done we've got another fight we're doing and it's to find the bride of christ okay the younger generation of voters are entering a world their parents would not recognize debt is one worry that they can relegate behind others including housing affordability climate change geopolitical tension in their own households and then i've got all this debt it's that it's no big deal you know we as long as we've gonna afford a house you want to be buying a house if your country's bus but anyway but anyway you know what i'm saying it's like oh it's no big deal and i just found some funny right here now but there are people that are saying we don't like what's going on and this is ordinary new zealanders are starting to wake up right that these are people that have had sort of christian upbringing or just uh that way inclined they're they're kind of going well hang on what's going on here like different it's coming on now like a same as what's happening in america it's the force is sort of rising up awakening you know by imposing this is an article in the otago daily times by imposing lockdown restrictions that were far tighter than they needed to be jacinda arden has brought the country to its knees now through generous subsidies even the private sector is becoming a state beneficiary into me thank you anymore there's no doubt about it our prime minister is again leading the world with bold measures this time it's not global warming or nuclear free moment not closing down the oil and gas exploration industry it's a much more fundamental and potentially far more destructive just in the arduino's transform new zealand into a socialist state and the tragedy is that most people are completely unaware that it's happening right socialist communists are there saying this big evil thing is coming in we've got to stand up and fight again so that's what's going on right and this i thought this was an interesting thing how new zealand learned to stop worrying and love government debt you know here's our treasure with us you know sitting in a pool of money you know just throwing it out there there's been a bad word in wellington for decades all of a sudden the government has planned to spend billions of dollars we don't have because of covert 19. um then then justice says justin looks at the new appetite on debt and how it compares with the rest of the world so they're saying well we don't really care anymore just yet borrow money and give us some cash right so i just want to talk about this so so the in new zealand we have certain laws i want to talk about the lockdown real quick but and it was um the the on the last lockdown that we had it was um i often wondered if it was legal because i thought that's kind of strange i don't think you can just put people in their houses and lock them away it's a little bit funny right so and and that is also getting the conspiracy guys and the the good godly rights fighting this thing to like well hang on hang on you can't lock us up you know it's against my rights and this evil thing is trying to lock me down turn us into a communist country you know they're all up in arms at it you know which there is there is truth to it because it is going to be a war that is happening because brotherhood said it would happen so there is truth to it i just want to make light of it because i don't want to make it like i'm a part of this mess you know and i'm fighting trying to fight for this because i'm not right but back then they had to we have what they call a civil defense emergency act so so and we have certain laws you know that we are certain rights are protected on a daily basis but when there's a winner either a mayor of a town of an area or the the government can declare either a state of local emergency or a state of national emergency and when that happens then there's different laws they enact a different set of laws that apply within that period of time and i think these are generally two weeks they can go on for seven days and they have to declare another one so they officially have to say i declare a state of emergency and then and then and there are different laws within that like there are sort of health laws and things within that that they can enact essentially it kind of they can sort of make their own rules up you know they can close roads off and things that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do i'll put this one in there because i thought it was quite funny that you know if there if if there's an area that's declared to be a state of local emergency or national emergency and there's a vehicle there or a boat or anything like your car sitting there they can just break into your car and take it and use it for the cause that they want to use it for you know so but the idea is fine you know hey look we're it's a time of trouble we need to your cars there we needed your diggers there your boats there we needed it to help the cause you know it's fine that's just the way that these things work right but but i think people were researching it and thinking actually you don't have the right to lock us down like hey you did you know you can't lock us away fighting back at this evil thing you know so then so then as a result quickly when everyone was locked away i think the government realizing we've kind of we may have we may get in a wee bit of a pickle here we may that because legal forces were sort of coming against them to say you can't lock us down you know that so they had to quickly enact another law to make it like you know russia law through right to make it's okay we can now we can lock you down they kind of had to they were on the back foot a bit because it because even during the time of lockdown the police didn't know what they're like well can we tell people to go home can we you probably could have just walked around and said no you can't show me what law there is to you know what i mean you could have gotten away with it because they didn't even know what their rights were and what they could do right there was it was all so they quickly rushed this law through you know which but hey it is what it is but this really gets the conspiracy theorists in there well not the complete the right you know the the god god you know it gets them all going because this law this this is the order now this is this is essentially not a laughing matter when you look at what it says right because it's people around the world are going what's going on in that country you guys are like look like a communist country now and so it's basically saying here's here's this law and the minister or the director general can can say say within the god framework of this law that this is what's going to happen right i want to just you guys read this one okay i'll read this is the law you're under right now because this law is enforced for two years and it's got to be renewed every three months but it's for two years this law is now in force right this is what we're looking at so so they can order you they can say uh anyone here rimpo you must stay at any specified place or retain from going to any specified place you you you either stay there we don't go there they can when they say that you legally have to stay there you can't go there you'll be a law breaker if you do that right you've got to refrain from association with specific persons you can't see andy in the story right stay physically distant from any person in any specified way they can tell you this refrain from traveling to or from any specified area aucklanders you can't go to wellington that's why now they can have police roadblocks because it's now a law because that what's happening now this this latest one is under this law so the police can stop and say where you're going oh i'm going to commend up to my batch no you're not you you and this region had to stay here so we can arrest you if you don't turn around and go back that's the law now they and then the police know they've got this power right retain from carrying out specific activities because this is one that got the other got them mixed up last time for example business activities involving close personnel contact will require specific activity to be carried out only in any specified way or compliance with specified measures like oh you've got to stop you stop your business you know there was really no real law in the last one to do that so we could have still operated just looked bad well i don't know that for a fact but you know it's it's sort of like that be isolated or quarantined in any specified place or any specified way just refrain from participating in gatherings of any specified kind in any specified place or any or in any or specified circumstances you know now this is the one that gets people right report for an undergo a medical examination or testing of any kind and at any place or time specified and in any specified way or specified circumstances that means now let me explain to you what what that means is that means they can walk into your house at any time of the day not they're saying we won't do that but this is what the law implies can be done walk into your house at any time of the day and i am forced you to have this medical test and and that's law and if you don't we can arrest you for breaking the law right um so that's pretty intense you know now if you're if you're against this evil communist thing you go man are we living in china or something are we living in russia you know police state is that what we've come to because these are right bring it on provide and specify circumstances or any specified way any information necessary to the purpose of contract tracing right so that's this is what's happening in our country too it's it's this it's this evil force of socialist communism coming in and you know like destroying our liberties into now the champions of the you know you know enter the savior that's going to come in and fight against us you know so political parties are rising up now we've got our own if you want to join you can join and fight this evil thing right it's not just in america not just in the uk in europe it's here as well we you know we can do this and it inspires us we're like yeah i love this country i'm going to fight back against this you know but be very careful don't get involved in it well that's just my opinion that's what i've chosen to do because this is not my fight right but there's a party called the advanced new zealand party or the nzpp there's two parties that are combined and there's a few guys on this but these guys seem to have gotten the most traction and they they come in and said we are against this we know what's happening you know it was it was run the advanced party is this guy um he's jamie lee ross he's actually sitting in p so he's in parliament at the moment fighting against all this stuff and and he had the um and his that another party called um the new zealand public party which was this guy billy taka christian guy very nice guy very very cool guy you know very cool very like very personable like he he would be a great guy to everyone he's a very nice guy but he's vehemently against this communist evil regime coming in and and he's fighting back hard you know these guys are fighting back and they're saying don't worry people we're going to be calm we're going to fight back at this thing and they're getting traction like wouldn't believe around the country their numbers are just growing and growing and growing people like yeah man let's fight back at this thing now you know there's some of his quotes secured everyone well democracy just suffered another punch in the stomach with the delay of elections and i'm deeply concerned that this government is going to continue its assault on our freedoms and our economy you know he's saying they're saying all the right things um here we knew this lockdown was planned and we announced it exactly one month before it happened like the august one we're saying they said look we've got government we've got information from our sources that there's going to be a lockdown and the second week of august people have told us it's going to happen get ready they're planning for it it's going to happen second week of august there was a lockdown right they're saying we told you so we this is a conspiracy there's this evil force coming on you know people are well we've got to fight back against us you know so these guys are gaining a lot of traction um now when the when the two-day lockdown was like was enforced now saying what they're going to do next these guys said right we're going to protest in the streets we're going to fight back at this we can't let this happen and this is just me but i believe some of their movement actually i think because conspiracy theories suddenly started to get a lot of traction in the social media and even mainstream news people were trying to fight back i could be wrong in this but i think these sort of protests actually stopped there from being a worse lockdown than what there was because this was gaining a lot of momentum and people aren't not aware of this stuff and they were like oh actually and a lot of it was from the indigenous from the maori people and they were fighting back saying no way no no right so so these did have an effect right this this actually pushed i think it pushed it back because they were like well there's a big force rising up like we probably can't just easily do this one because these guys were getting a lot of traction that doesn't mean he's doing it i'm not yeah i'm just saying this is what this is what's happening in our country right and here's some of their policies i'm going to move on shortly some of their policies we will fully investigate and remove any and all united nations u.n agenda and agreements from new zealand government and society if they do not serve the people of new zealand because they're saying there's all these agendas from this global communist body that have come in and putting agendas on us we're going to remove all those right and he's saying the chinese communist party has been fully implicated in funding new zealand's main political parties labour and national we're gonna we're gonna look into that if we get into power and find out where is this communist money going and what's it backing and why they're doing all this you know so they're aware of you know starting to see and people are waking up you know oh yeah let's you understand what i'm saying it's it's everywhere this is this is i just threw this in there because i just thought i would in new zealand too they've been trying to now divide the politics left and right as well into you know the left-wing godless kind of groups and then the right-wing christian you know they're trying to and racist all sort of that's what they're trying to do right in the end they've tried to do it with the national leader to get to put her in that camp because you know she'll come out and say things like oh does it matter that i'm white you know and i look that proof she's like that but i'm just saying this because this is what we we face right but they her narrative is slightly harder to get across because this is her um her high school sweetheart to be married to forever you know and that's their family so to call her you know this is what you're like is this it's but if there were other people in in power that you know that's the way this country's going as well okay so now i'm i'm gonna go back onto this now we'll never do any good with politics this is what i think about this whole thing too it's rotten god's idea of having a king a righteous king is right but politics simply spread out you you can buy anything out cheat lie steal everything else and i said a few sundays ago and look where you're at see nothing but just a crooked mess of everything but a righteous king can make his own laws and you can you can kill a man like saying and if you know good politics or politicians that's all right you'll get out of it see what he's saying is god's way was having a righteous king that was balanced that his views went from there to there and he had a balanced view and he would he would apply the right opinion in the right situation i'll apply this view this left view to that situation because right below apply this view to that situation he was balanced now that that's actually that's that's what he's that's what is the actual ideal way of god doing it of course that's not going to happen because people are scared of one person ruling inhabit but a righteous king is is an ideal scenario because he's he's all things right the democracy is a good idea but it won't work just like communism all things are common it sounds good but it won't work no the god's way of having a king like king david was was right and you've got one mind centered over it you know balance the view over it like one leader and a bunch of geese and so forth you can you can't take two or three of them you then you miss them all together and you come up with any kind of idea you know you it which is what we've got now i want to start talking about where we we fit in this now we see this uniting time coming now watch when the church has united itself against the message and then when it does that the nations are uniting themselves against communism to destroy the church again just exactly what it did in the first place see it repeats itself right again israel had to turn down the message first and when they turned down the message then the military the national life itself united together of the other nations and come in and destroyed the church and today they've turned down the message of the lord jesus and they've turned it down and now the time has come to where communism is uniting the world together against the church see it has to be that way now it's hard to say that okay it was hard for them jews to believe they said now come brethren we see that our god is with us and i'll talk to this in a bit so we're going to the temple this is when titus was coming against them after they finished rejecting the word then then then this evil came upon them and they thought now god you're going to deliver us right and it's the same thing's happening today our god is with us we've gone to the temple and now we will pray and let the holy father so and so and holy father so-and-so lead in prayer close the gate you know we'll fight and titus took a stand and still right there for about a year or more see right on guard and starve them right out there couldn't be a one of them even get outside the city and they died starved and when he went in there and tore down walls down and blood gushed out and run like rivers down there we slaughtered everything that was in there that was the eventual end of then once they turned away the word and they tried to fight but now the followers of christ of the lord jesus that were actually in there they said when you see the armies encompassed around jerusalem flee get out flee so so titus pulled back i think because it was winter and they and they said this you're fighting a losing fight we got told to flee so they fled right now we've been told the same thing flee get out of it right so just to put it in like a graphical term so because this is what i'm saying to picture this is where we as bride fit into this equation because what happened there is exactly what's happening today it's now front page news you know it's all around us in that time you had the you know you had the the pharisees essentially jesus came to the jews which were mixed you know the pharisees and then everyone was mixed in there and i've got divided into three people that unbelievers make believers and true believers which essentially the three that you got on you know in this case the romans that that force were the unbelievers although they were you know just in type they were they were believers come out but you know as a force the pharisees in that line were the make believers and the the disciples the ones that the lord was calling out the true believers so so the word came in and ministered you know and and then the first thing that had to happen was you know that's the lord coming out and preaching the word coming and and the first thing the uniting had to happen from the the make believers had to unite first against christ and against all of his followers to to get him out you know if he comes into your synagogue and preaches you're not welcome you know we're gonna we're gonna kick you out of the organization and so they united first because we're talking about now uniting they're united first against christ and any of his followers you know who who's this man you know were you born blind you know they told them the truth then they beat him you know they they're they're against this so the first thing they had to do was unite against the word against christ and against his followers so they did and they they pushed them out and then see that's this is what happened in that time and then then after that the unbelievers the romans then united against the against the church against the not the church but the they make believers right that's what happened next and now when they saw that coming on they then all united together to fight back against it right that was the type and and now eventually they they were totally destroyed which rome will be totally destroyed by communism by russia is gonna and one day your destruction will come that's that's what's been prophesied in this whole this whole movement it's gonna be it's gonna it's a win for an hour but it's gonna all be done away with right all around the world just wanna read this all around the world i guess you know what i mean then everywhere why did you turn me down in switzerland why did you do it finland the blood's going to be upon your hands that's upon you not me you never turned me down you turned him down not me because he said i don't believe in such the words say such there you are blind pharisee they can discern communism to send all these things but the hour they're living and they can't discern that's exactly right now this is what happened in this time when the spirit falls they become and there becomes a move amongst the people them denominations will swing together just as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit and the church of god will be ousted that's the bride and they'll make such a racket until their confederate and put a boycott on anybody who don't belong to them rome will rule the world for just an hour she'll rule for a little peace not communism rome will room will rule the world with the cooperation of protestantism and a denominational form of church which god has rejected that's as close to the word of god as i know so that's what's on the um if you want to read the script that's what's going to happen don't think this evil communist is going to win in this battle rome is going to win this whole fight that's happening rome is going to win and you'll see it play out before you right and the bible says she'll come up like a lamb freedom of religion two little horns civil and ecclesiastical and after a while they united and spoke like the dragon did and done everything the dragon did before him and the bible said they made an image unto the beast the confederation of church just what they got in right now here in new york city and and there they the great big morgue up there so he calls it a morg all you baptist or methodist baptist and pentecostals and every one of you economical uh economical people out there trying to do such things as that and selling out your birthrights like joining up with the catholics to fight the communists to join that bunch of babylon what's the matter with you sure selling your birth rights like esau did for a mess of potter's that's all you're going to get that's all now what brother branham said is there's a time when they couldn't put aside their differences and unite together because there was no purpose to right but but when there's when it looks like your whole belief system is going to be overtaken then you're going to put aside your differences and unite together and fight back right and that's the the climate that we've got now is that there's so much of this evil communist dark force coming around that that that the christians and this whole group are saying actually we've just got to put everything aside because we've got a greater cause which is this and we can put aside all our differences and we can now unite and that's what's happening that's what's happening and and it will get exciting when they start winning because for a long time it's like they've been losing and it's going to be exciting when they start winning because they're going to start winning that's what is prophesied and they're going to be like wow we couldn't believe and it's there's going to be a revival you know we can't believe we're winning you know praise god you know but it's all of the devil right so now here's our diagram again but this is now this is now the this is us right now 2020 exactly what's happening the same way you've got you've got the three groups the unbelievers i'm not people but you know just the unbelievers make believers and true believers that unbelievers are like this communist evil force that's coming on the make believers are romanism and dominationism that sort of and then you've got the true believers which is the bride and you had the same thing again you know the the word came you know but the the denominations united against the word and and in everywhere that it was they kicked it out and that's where we stand today is you can't the word is not welcome in any any places right so this is now we stand in a very awkward position people because we've got no friends right see the only friend we've got in this whole thing the only friend we have is the lord jesus and and the bride that's when you look at that's that's all we've got no one else is on our side just give me jesus that's and that's that's hope that's our whole that's our whole political theme jesus that's all we got you know that's a so that's so that's where we stand in this this whole battle you know now once that happened then of course this next scenario happens where the where this communist this evil force comes and rises up against the church against against that you know and that's what's happening now and then like i said it all bands together to fight back against this communism against this force of evil that's what i'm saying we don't have a part in this fight yeah that's what i was saying earlier this is not our battle we're not we're not on any of these teams you know we're not on the unbelievers team we're not on this other team we're all on our own with just the lord but that's all that we need we don't need anyone else you know we don't we we don't we don't need to we're not we're just fighting for his kingdom for his bride you know and for his cause which is just to just to find the last one and go you know so in amongst this ferocious battle it's ferocious all around us it's going to be very challenging for us not to get caught up in it because it's going to get worse and worse and worse it's going to be we have to make sure that we know what we're doing and just stay on track because it's going to be very tempting very tempting to to join in especially when people start their our people start winning it's like oh maybe i should you know sign up now i'm not saying don't sign up i'm not saying that look i'm not trying to advocate political things but i'm just pointing out to you the overarching truth of the matter is this is our team christ and his word are our team you know and and that's the he's going to be the winner in the whole thing so we're already with a winner there's no need to go with any other winners i've got three quotes to read then i'm done and this is just finishing it communism has to rise these other things has to rise and the church has to unite itself at yonder when those in the nations out there for the world council of churches and the bride has to unite itself under the word of god in order to do that god has sent down the heavenly sign and things that prove to the church and he has to and as he has to the nation amen god uniting time yes oh my now you remember now there is the uniting of the word uniting back again bringing back the faith that was once delivered to the saints bring him back this could only be done on this day the only time it could be done is right now it never was attacked anywhere else they went off on denominational sprees but now it don't belong to no denominational denominational spree because it's time for the uniting of men and women of every race every color every creed everything under christ by the baptism of the holy spirit and back to the word uniting time for the bride oh my uniting every word that's been scattered all abroad by these organizations ever since that night here rome when they organized the first church and they've organized luther they've organized wesley they organized all the rest of the churches and doing that they had to adopt the creed and then when god sent someone else they could not receive it therefore it was not possible until now and god promised in the last days that the faith of the fathers will be restored back to the bride again and that it will be this way and it couldn't be no other time but this time right now look what a sign from heaven is a pillar of fire hanging amongst us and with signs and wonders of the lord jesus christ and while he speaks to us that never fails to be perfectly on the dot amen then when we see where we're standing uniting time we see nations uniting we see the world uniting we see communism uniting we see the church is uniting and we see god uniting himself with his bride until here in the church is the same thing hallelujah like the pyramid there right uniting themselves together god uniting why never never before since the early church was a pillar of fire ever among the people never before since the early church did they ever see the things that we're seeing today sorry and this was only made possible when god sent the seven seals and give us a sign bite and send seven angels down out of heaven and come to bring back that scattered word in them denominations and tie it back to the word of god again and bring down his holy spirit jesus said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will it shall be done unto you uniting the bride back with the word which is god the church and the word not the church and the creed the church and the word the bride and the word united together it's uniting time and that's that's the that's the camp that we're in is the camp of christ being united with christ and his word according to the message of brother branham the the the the inspired word for this this time not just any old word but the word through a prophet of this time and do we want with all the other stuff but just keep in mind our main main goal and it's going to be a privilege to go through these times with you all right because it's we're in treacherous times you know this is very treacherous we're in but it's only going to get better for the bride that's what our promise has been it's actually going to get better and better and that the power and the presence of god is going to come more and more all the time that's what's going to happen so it's actually going to be one of the best times for humanity for for the christian to ever be and it's going to be now it's going we're we're approaching the greatest time for the believer that there ever was so we don't have to be scared we don't need to be worried about anything you see all this mess going on just look up your redemption drawers no just be happy you know let's let's take this head on hey this is enjoyable you know if the lord didn't think i could do this he wouldn't have put me here i'm here bring it on bring on the end of the world you know just just be strong be of good courage if god before us who can be against us you know even if you're all by yourself brother brown says one man in the hands of god is the majority so what does it matter let's um let's just sing one um i just want to sing one slow song and then we'll just um pray after that i just want to sing turn your eyes upon jesus and then we'll just um pray and we'll be dismissed
