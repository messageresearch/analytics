[9:12] Before
[9:23] the world began,
[9:26] you knew my name and held me in your
[9:30] hand.
[9:32] When the earth was silent, I was there
[9:36] with you singing your praise.
[9:42] and I came to the earth
[9:46] and I took my first breath
[9:51] and the cry that I made was sing your
[9:55] praise.

[10:07] I have a reason to lift up my hands and
[10:10] rejoice. I have a reason to sing.
[10:16] When I was lost in the darkness,
[10:21] you came to find me.
[10:26] I heard you calling my name. Took my sin
[10:30] and my shame and you save me.

[12:00] and my shame. and you saved me.
[12:05] Now I can call you my savior.
[12:10] I can call you redeemer.
[12:14] I can call you my healer, my father, my
[12:18] friend. I can call you my king.

[20:32] you. I could search

[20:42] Lord

[20:53] before brother Michelle comes up
[20:58] cuz I know what it's
[21:06] be in the presence of the Lord.
[21:14] And I know what's
[21:22] because I'm stood still.
[21:30] What is
[21:38] the families restored
[21:46] because we stay
[21:49] here
[21:53] in the presence of
[21:56] Oh,
[22:01] no one had to say a word.
[22:08] Couldn't even make a sound.
[22:17] I give up everything
[22:24] for this treasure I found.

[25:44] Cuz I don't want you to go.
[25:53] My heart is burning.
[26:00] in your presence, oh Lord.
[26:11] Amen.
[26:12] Thank you, Josh. Thank you, musicians.
[26:18] Let's turn to our Bibles in Isaiah
[26:22] 45
[26:24] 22-23.
[26:51] Look unto me and be ye saved.
[26:56] All the ends of the earth, for I am God,
[26:59] and there is none else. I have sworn by
[27:02] myself. The word is gone out of my mouth
[27:06] in righteousness and shall not return
[27:12] that unto me every knee shall bow and
[27:16] every tongue shall answer.
[27:20] We also turn to Hebrews 12:2,
[27:32] looking unto Jesus the author and
[27:34] finisher of our faith,
[27:37] who for the joy that was set before him,
[27:40] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[27:44] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[27:46] throne of God.
[27:50] We'll also read Psalms 35 3-6.
[27:59] And just to save time, we'll just read
[28:01] verse 5. They looked unto him and were
[28:06] lightened, and their faces were not
[28:09] ashamed.
[28:12] Let's pray. Our most precious heavenly
[28:15] father, we bow in your presence this
[28:17] evening. Oh God, we are so thankful once
[28:20] more, Lord, to give us another
[28:21] opportunity to assemble us in your
[28:24] house, Lord, to hear from thee, oh dear
[28:26] father. As a human being, Lord, I have
[28:28] nothing to offer. But father, I depend
[28:31] on thee, Lord, dear God. Come down,
[28:34] Father, and speak with your children,
[28:36] Lord. They came from their homes,
[28:38] Father, expecting to hear from thee,
[28:40] dear God. And father we come unto thee
[28:43] to ask for it. We commit the service
[28:45] into your able ends. Father take away
[28:48] our sins. Oh dear father. And the word
[28:50] that we've read Lord let it be a reality
[28:53] in our lives. We commit it into your
[28:55] ends for ask it in Jesus name.
[28:58] You can take your the comfort of your
[29:00] seats.
[29:08] So this evening we are going to speak on
[29:10] a subject of look and leaf
[29:13] and see how the Lord will lead us.
[29:16] I will try to make it like a Sunday
[29:18] school with so many pictures. As you
[29:21] know it's very hard to stand this side
[29:23] facing this way. It's always easier to
[29:26] be on that side looking the front but
[29:29] when you come to this side it's a place
[29:32] I've always been scared to be and I'm
[29:35] nervous. So
[29:37] I will I hope you will support me with
[29:39] your prayers and your amens.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Even if the point is not strong, just
[29:44] say amen.
[29:47] They say the people who just nod are
[29:50] from the people from the land of nod.
[29:54] So I don't believe anyone here is from
[29:56] nod.
[29:59] So it's just a revision for the for all
[30:01] of us. But for the children they will
[30:04] have some pictures to enjoy.
[30:08] I was uh encouraged this morning when uh
[30:11] pastor sent the message in the morning
[30:13] and it was the same
[30:18] fast that I had already prepared my
[30:20] sermon on and I saw it then I thought
[30:25] well it must be the hand of God.
[30:29] Okay, now coming back to our subject
[30:31] look and live. So how do we look?
[30:35] We have different ways of looking. But
[30:37] the question is how do we look?
[30:42] Everybody's looking.
[30:45] Everyone is looking for something.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; And looking for something to happen.
[30:53] When our friend Marion goes for hunting,
[30:55] he always look to tune his
[30:59] gun to make sure that when he eats the
[31:02] target, it doesn't miss.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; So, different people are looking.
[31:12] Sorry, I have two screens to play around
[31:16] and pastor is used to it. So, I'm still
[31:20] learning.
[31:24] So we know that the world is constantly
[31:26] watching the skies.
[31:34] Every nation are surrender screen for
[31:37] defense. They work like magic eye
[31:40] watching the sky for everything that
[31:43] appears
[31:44] such as atomic missiles. When something
[31:47] is detected, they have the system that
[31:51] can trace it back to where it was sent
[31:53] from.
[32:00] The prophet in 1963
[32:03] he said everything is looking the Ford
[32:06] company is looking
[32:08] to make better food. The chef is looking
[32:13] make to make a better chorate. Phoenix
[32:16] is looking to make a larger and better
[32:18] town.
[32:20] The nation is looking for a more
[32:22] territory
[32:23] so it can spread itself. The church is
[32:26] just looking is looking for more
[32:28] members. But the bride is looking for
[32:32] the coming of our Lord. Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; When the prophet was speaking these
[32:37] words in 1963,
[32:41] it was different from but he knew what
[32:45] will happen in the future. The God had
[32:47] given him the prophecy.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Look at what is happening now in 2026.
[32:51] It's not just temporarate. It's not just
[32:54] Ford. We have Tesla. We have
[33:00] iPhones.
[33:02] We have big cities.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; So similarly countries are competing.
[33:09] Look at what with the different systems
[33:11] who has the best security system.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; So everyone is looking. See what
[33:15] happened between Venezuela and the US
[33:17] the other day.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; They were all looking even Venezuela was
[33:21] looking. Yeah.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; On the message look,
[33:30] we are all looking.
[33:34] Depends on what the voice is trying to
[33:37] tell you to look for. Some of us are
[33:40] saying look for this. And if if it's a
[33:43] church, we are saying we want to make
[33:46] more this year, more members.
[33:50] That's all right. But the voice that is
[33:53] trying to say to you this morning is
[33:57] like a writer of this epistle we believe
[34:01] to be Paul which is saying looking for
[34:04] the coming of Jesus Christ the second
[34:06] time looking for him. In order to do it
[34:09] you got to see something before you can
[34:12] tell somebody somebody else to look at
[34:14] what you are seeing. So basically before
[34:17] you tell somebody look at that you need
[34:19] you need to have seen it then you tell
[34:21] him look
[34:30] even when the supernatural cloud was
[34:32] photographed over Arizona in 1963 the
[34:36] world didn't know about it they tried to
[34:39] research different sidists they tried to
[34:43] turn it this way turn it this
[34:46] But because we have the word for the
[34:48] day, the prophet came and said, "Well,
[34:51] if you'll turn the picture like this and
[34:53] look,
[34:56] you can probably see
[34:59] from the audience. It's Christ." See his
[35:02] eyes looking ear just as perfect as it
[35:06] could be, wearing the wigs, white wigs
[35:09] of supreme deity and judge of all
[35:12] heavens and earth. Can you see his eyes,
[35:15] nose,
[35:17] his mouth?
[35:19] Just turn the picture from this. The way
[35:22] they they edit this away, the way it is
[35:28] supposed to be
[35:30] and you can see it.
[35:35] There we have it in the right when it
[35:38] stand well.
[35:42] its supreme judge.
[35:45] There is none other but him and that is
[35:48] a perfect identification again
[35:52] vindication that the message is the
[35:54] truth.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; This is the truth. It is true and making
[35:59] him not the third person but the only
[36:02] person. Yeah,
[36:05] &gt;&gt; with the white.
[36:07] See, you can see the dark his face, his
[36:10] beard, and his eyes. And notice he is
[36:14] looking
[36:17] from his from his comes the light
[36:21] shining on the right hand side to is to
[36:24] which he is looking to. And on the
[36:27] cross, that's where he looked to the
[36:31] right where he pardoned the sinner.
[36:36] In the light of his resurrection, we
[36:39] still go forth in his name.
[36:43] That is on the message. It is the rising
[36:45] of the sun.
[36:48] And the greater is Solom than Solomon is
[36:50] here again. He came and said,
[36:56] Paul said, pressing to the mark of the
[36:59] eye calling, I go forward.
[37:02] I go forth. I go forward. I know Mr.
[37:05] Moody was a great man. Mr. Whistley was
[37:09] a great man. The Pentecostal move, the
[37:12] Baptist move
[37:14] were great.
[37:16] But let's press towards the mark of the
[37:19] eye calling in Christ. Do don't look
[37:23] through a rear mirror
[37:26] &gt;&gt; 40 years ago. Look what is tonight. When
[37:31] you are driving and you are looking at
[37:33] the back, you will crash. So it's the
[37:36] same way with our message. Let's not
[37:39] look at what others did. Let's look at
[37:43] what he is doing
[37:45] &gt;&gt; and what is what he has prophesied and
[37:47] what he has promised is going to happen.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Look what the scriptures promises
[37:54] tonight.
[37:56] He did promise them in that day but we
[37:59] are living on above there now. We are
[38:02] going on.
[38:09] God makes himself known at the end of
[38:13] each world system.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Look at the end of at the time of Noah.
[38:18] At the end, everybody knew there was
[38:20] God.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; But when Noah was telling them, let's
[38:24] build the ark, there will be rain. No
[38:26] one could listen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; It's the same today.
[38:30] When we talk of the message, we talk of
[38:32] the word. No one wants to listen. It
[38:34] just sees as weird people going into our
[38:37] church.
[38:39] But
[38:41] like it was in the days of Noah, we know
[38:43] what is the truth. And we thank God for
[38:47] revealing all this to us.
[38:53] Look especially unto me at the end of
[38:55] each world system because he's always he
[38:59] always makes himself known so real at
[39:02] the end of the world system when it's
[39:04] coming to its end. Look unto me all ye
[39:09] ends of the world.
[39:16] But what is the question?
[39:20] What do you see when you look?
[39:24] That's a question we should ask
[39:25] ourselves. It depends on what you look
[39:28] for. That's what you find.
[39:35] I looked at the definition of look.
[39:38] It's the act of directing one's gaze in
[39:41] order to see someone or something.
[39:46] The verb is direct. One's guess towards
[39:49] someone or something or in a specific
[39:52] direction.
[39:58] When we look at Genesis 15:5, he says,
[40:05] "And he brought him forth abroad and
[40:08] said, look towards heaven,
[40:12] and tell the stars, if thou be able to
[40:16] number them." And he said unto him, "So
[40:20] shall thy seed be."
[40:22] So there's always God has always wanted
[40:25] people to look it in a diff in a certain
[40:27] way.
[40:30] In Genesis 41:33,
[40:32] "Now therefore, let Pharaoh look out a
[40:37] man discree and wise, and set him over
[40:40] the land of Egypt."
[40:44] So Pharaoh also had to look in a certain
[40:46] way. He had to look for a certain man.
[40:50] Exodus 3:6.
[40:52] Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy
[40:56] father,
[40:59] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[41:02] and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
[41:06] face, for he was afraid to look upon
[41:08] God.
[41:11] You know, it's not easy to see God face
[41:14] to face.
[41:16] And that's why Moses was when he he had
[41:19] the chance to see him face to face, he
[41:21] hid his face.
[41:32] Somebody else looked at the back.
[41:36] Genesis 19:17 it says, "And it came to
[41:39] pass when they had brought them forth
[41:42] abroad
[41:44] that he said, escape for thy life. Look
[41:48] not behind thee.
[41:51] Neither stay thou
[41:53] in the in all the plain. Escape to the
[41:57] mountain, lest thou be consumed." But
[42:00] what happened?
[42:02] Lot's wife looked back to see what is
[42:04] happening. Yeah.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; And what happened?
[42:08] He turned to a pillar of salt.
[42:13] So if God tells you this way, you need
[42:15] to go this way. If you look back, there
[42:18] are consequences for it.
[42:22] So we need to look to the word.
[42:30] So what could we look that is more solid
[42:32] than God? There's none. Look at this
[42:35] world. Everything is passing.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; We can see so many people were great and
[42:40] it all passed.
[42:47] And now God is saying here look unto me
[42:50] I am God and there is none other.
[42:55] And I wonder in the time that we are
[42:57] living now, what could we look to that
[43:00] to that would be more solid than God and
[43:04] God is the word. So look to the word of
[43:08] God today for your answer. The Bible as
[43:11] the answer for this day.
[43:14] It add it for other days. It's got it
[43:18] forever because it's the Christ the same
[43:22] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible has the answer because the
[43:31] Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[43:35] being revealed since the foundation of
[43:38] the world. He has been revealed in the
[43:41] form of prophets.
[43:44] He has been revealed in the form of
[43:45] kings.
[43:47] He has been revealed in the form of
[43:49] lawgivers
[43:52] because that's what he is. King,
[43:55] prophet, lawgiver. And God now he said
[43:59] look to me.
[44:04] But people look for him again also for
[44:06] the wrong reasons.
[44:12] I will let the prophet say it well.
[44:16] and you say, "I've done that." It
[44:18] depends on what you look at
[44:22] &gt;&gt; determines what you look at
[44:25] is where and what you look for him for.
[44:30] What are you looking at,
[44:32] what purpose do you have in looking at
[44:35] him? It's only it only depends on what
[44:38] you are looking for. That's what you
[44:42] find. Usually people come to a meeting,
[44:45] religious gatherings. Some of them go to
[44:49] find big crowd or people to sit with.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hate to say this, but it's true.
[44:58] Some go to church just to show their
[45:00] clothes.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; You bought a new cloth. You are asking
[45:07] when will it be on Sunday or Wednesday
[45:09] for me to wear it to go to be seen where
[45:11] I'm smart.
[45:13] is the wrong reason.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Some goes to church because they say
[45:20] this is the biggest church in the city.
[45:24] How many people in this city they say go
[45:25] to those the bigger churches? They say
[45:27] no that is small. I want to go to the
[45:29] big one in the
[45:33] it got the best name.
[45:37] a certain class of people goes to this
[45:40] church
[45:42] then that's wrong
[45:45] or your friends go to this church so I
[45:47] need to go to that church that's the
[45:50] wrong motive you are not looking to the
[45:53] right thing that's that the church is
[45:56] established for God said look to me
[46:06] that's the The very reason that Jesus
[46:08] was not understood when he came to
[46:11] earth, if they would have only looked in
[46:15] the word of God instead of their
[46:18] traditional tradition of that day, they
[46:21] would have known he was the son of God.
[46:24] But how did they look at him?
[46:28] They say, "We know his father and we
[46:31] know where he comes from."
[46:34] So from that region uh no God cannot
[46:37] come from there
[46:39] but they missed it.
[46:43] The Bible plains declares his full
[46:45] coming and he come in full revelation of
[46:49] the word and each generation reveals him
[46:52] in the full revelation that is looted
[46:55] for that time.
[47:02] This generation must reveal Jesus.
[47:06] That's the revelation of him that is
[47:09] promised in the word must be refilled to
[47:12] this generation. If the churches would
[47:14] receive it, somebody else will rise up
[47:17] and do it.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; And we know God keeps his word
[47:26] &gt;&gt; and what God said, he will always make
[47:29] sure that he performs it. Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Let's look at uh Abraham.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; We go to some examples. Now,
[47:43] Abraham knew that his body was as good
[47:46] as dead.
[47:52] But he considered not his own body.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; He considered not the deadness of
[47:59] Sarah's womb.
[48:01] A young girl he had married his half
[48:04] sister
[48:06] lived with her all these years and now
[48:09] she is 90 years old.
[48:12] Just imagine that. And he is 100 years
[48:14] old.
[48:16] But he didn't even think about that.
[48:22] He didn't even it didn't even come to
[48:24] his mind that I'm 100 years. She's 90.
[48:28] Yeah.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he focused all the unbelief
[48:34] out.
[48:37] That's what the church should do. That's
[48:40] what each member of the church should
[48:42] do.
[48:45] We focus out all
[48:48] of your doubt out.
[48:50] Look only to the word. It is promised.
[48:54] God said it got to be that way.
[49:02] And you know, he made us a promise for
[49:05] this day.
[49:08] And our promise today is just as sure as
[49:12] to be refilled as it was to Abraham.
[49:16] For we are the children of Abraham.
[49:19] Being dead in Christ, we were Abraham's
[49:21] seats and hes with him according to the
[49:24] promise.
[49:33] Some look to see him through the myth
[49:36] as a myth, a Santa Claus.
[49:40] Look at Christmas. Many people don't
[49:42] know God but during Christmas they are
[49:45] just thinking about Santa Claus and all
[49:47] that but they don't know anything about
[49:50] Christianity
[49:52] or some of them look to him as some
[49:55] historical act that God did many years
[49:58] ago.
[50:00] Some of them look to him yet as a baby
[50:04] in a manger.
[50:06] But the question is what do you see when
[50:09] you look to at him?
[50:12] Do you see the second person
[50:14] of trinity or do you see a trinity?
[50:18] Three in one.
[50:21] You only see him as you look at him
[50:24] through the word. That's the only way
[50:27] you know it because he is the word.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; It refill himself. Depends on what
[50:33] you're looking for.
[50:43] You see him as his look as you look at
[50:46] him through his word and recognize him.
[50:52] Let's look at Gazi example.
[50:59] Sometimes there are things that are
[51:02] happening around us
[51:05] that we cannot understand.
[51:07] Others are saying are seeing this this
[51:10] way and you you are seeing this way.
[51:13] Look at how looked at it.
[51:21] When he looked at it, he saw army
[51:24] saw many soldiers coming to fight.
[51:27] Look at Dan down there that day when
[51:30] Elijah had been surrounded by the Syrian
[51:32] army and his faithful servant Gazi who
[51:36] looked with him,
[51:38] waited at him, who lived with him,
[51:42] waited at him, cooked for him, and kept
[51:45] the clothes clean,
[51:47] poured water on his hands, was right
[51:50] with him day and night, listened to him
[51:54] teach and preach. And that morning when
[51:57] he woke up he looked out and he seen the
[52:01] Syrian army all around. He said, "My
[52:05] father Halas,
[52:07] look at the opposition. We have a old
[52:10] Syrian army."
[52:17] But what did Elijah see?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; The opposite. Something totally
[52:21] different.
[52:24] You see Elijah when he rose up, he
[52:27] looked the same the same place Gazed
[52:31] looked and what did he see?
[52:36] And so he prayed, "God, open this young
[52:39] man's eyes. Now his eyes were wide open,
[52:43] but he said, "Open his eyes that he
[52:46] might see." And when his eyes, his
[52:49] spiritual eyes, not just the natural
[52:52] eyes, came open, the old mountain was
[52:56] full of chariots of fire
[52:59] and angels all around the that prophet.
[53:03] See, it was a different it was different
[53:06] when his eyes came open.
[53:14] Look at Moses again.
[53:17] As a young man looked through the palace
[53:20] window
[53:22] at the slaves, he saw the same bunch
[53:26] of grim dirty mud ridden slaves that
[53:29] Pharaoh saw. And when Pharaoh looked
[53:33] upon them,
[53:35] the Egyptian, they wasn't nothing but a
[53:38] bunch of slaves. That's all we are good
[53:42] for. just to the human mad dabber
[53:46] to make muddy bricks for the benefit of
[53:50] the cities that Pharaoh was building.
[53:53] That's the way Egyptians and Pharaoh
[53:56] looked at the slaves. But Moses when he
[53:59] looked at them, it was a different look.
[54:03] when is he seen passing by the windows
[54:07] the great ditches in their faces and
[54:10] tears that rain down from their cheeks
[54:13] and their bent bodies. He looked upon
[54:16] them as the people of God.
[54:21] He didn't look upon them as slaves.
[54:25] He looked at them as the chosen people
[54:27] of God.
[54:29] So he look Pharaoh was looking at them
[54:31] as people for his work
[54:34] &gt;&gt; to make he build his cities but
[54:39] when Moses looked at them he saw his
[54:41] children of God. So now it depends on
[54:44] how you look at it
[54:46] and the revelation that you have to look
[54:59] through the word
[55:02] and when you look at Jesus as the
[55:05] promise word of the hour then it will be
[55:08] revealed to you. If you look at him, you
[55:12] will see that he is the same yesterday,
[55:15] today, and forever.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; The same Christ,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; he looked
[55:30] I'll start from the beginning. It's just
[55:31] like a man is always talking about how
[55:34] great God is and what he has done. How
[55:37] what things he is going to do and not
[55:40] seeing the things he has he is doing
[55:43] right now. He looks at him in history.
[55:45] He looks at him in prophecy but forgets
[55:48] that he is the doing the same right now
[55:51] as he did then. That's just right.
[55:54] So we always look at all the histories
[55:58] what happened in the past but we forget
[56:00] what he is doing right now.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for Noah. It wasn't easy
[56:06] for Abraham
[56:08] and the people who lived those those
[56:10] times
[56:13] as it is not easy for us. But when you
[56:16] look at all that you find ours is very
[56:18] easy simple just believe the word of
[56:20] God. Simple.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] It doesn't ask you to stop smoking, stop
[56:26] drinking, stop doing that. Just believe
[56:28] the word of God. He will do the rest.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; I look at another example. After the
[56:39] Easter morning, the disciples
[56:42] walked towards a mouse, sorrowful and
[56:46] confused.
[56:48] A man joined them and walked with them
[56:51] all day speaking of Christ. They were
[56:54] talking about what had happened and he
[56:57] was crucified and all that with him
[57:02] until
[57:05] the whole day it's a long journey
[57:10] when they invited him
[57:15] he did something the same way he had
[57:17] done before his crucif crucifixion
[57:20] because they walked then they had
[57:22] reached where they were going Then he
[57:24] was almost passing. Then they invited
[57:26] him to come with him. Then that is the
[57:29] time they realized oh is this not the
[57:33] same Jesus?
[57:39] We look at another example is what did
[57:43] Isiah see?
[57:47] When he looked, he saw one
[57:50] was called counselor,
[57:53] prince of peace, mighty God, everlasting
[57:57] father.
[58:00] That's what he saw.
[58:10] And another example is Daniel.
[58:16] What did Daniel see?
[58:24] A stone.
[58:26] He said, "I saw a stone eed out of the
[58:30] mountain without ants,
[58:33] and it rolled into the kingdom of the
[58:35] worlds and broke them into pieces, and
[58:38] they bowed away like a chaff upon the
[58:41] summer thrashing floor.
[58:43] and the stone growled into a great
[58:46] mountain that covered the whole earth.
[58:49] That's what he said about him.
[58:54] We also have another example of
[58:55] Nebuchadnezzar.
[58:57] What did he see?
[59:03] He drew the three believing children,
[59:06] Meshach, Shrach, and Abednego
[59:11] in the fairy furnace. But when when he
[59:14] came to look,
[59:16] what did he see?
[59:21] He Nebuchadnezzar said he looked like
[59:24] son of God. That's what he saw when he
[59:27] looked into the crime that he had done.
[59:32] There was one that was looking like the
[59:34] son of God.
[59:38] We have another one. Ezekiel,
[59:44] what did he see when he looked?
[59:49] Ezekiel looked away to see him one day
[59:52] and he was
[59:54] a wheel in a middle of the wheel
[59:59] way up in the middle of the air. He was
[1:00:02] the AB to the wheel where
[1:00:06] every spoke is
[1:00:08] spoke is fastened to.
[1:00:11] Amen. The big wheel run by faith, but
[1:00:16] the little wheel turned by the power of
[1:00:18] the Lord. That's who Ezekiel saw when he
[1:00:21] looked away.
[1:00:29] What about Jonah?
[1:00:35] He was in the belly of the whale
[1:00:41] because he had gone against the word of
[1:00:43] God. What God had asked him to go, then
[1:00:45] he decided to go the other way. But the
[1:00:48] whale swallowed him. But when he came to
[1:00:51] his senses, what did he see?
[1:00:55] Jonah was in the belly of the whale,
[1:00:57] deep in the sea. Yet he refused to look
[1:00:59] at the circumstances. He said,
[1:01:02] "Once more will I look towards your holy
[1:01:05] temple." So even in the belly of the
[1:01:09] whale, he could see the holy temple.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; He knew there is where I belong and I'm
[1:01:15] going there no matter the circumstances
[1:01:17] that I'm in.
[1:01:23] He look he was looking to the promise
[1:01:26] connected to it.
[1:01:34] What about John the Baptist?
[1:01:38] He looked one time
[1:01:40] and what did he see?
[1:01:47] He saw a dove and a voice saying, "This
[1:01:50] is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:01:53] dwell in."
[1:01:56] That's what he saw. Then he saw Jesus
[1:01:59] and God being the same person
[1:02:03] because spirit come down from heaven
[1:02:06] like a dove saying this is my beloved
[1:02:08] son in whom I'm pleased to dwell.
[1:02:12] That's what he saw.
[1:02:20] And you know John was the greatest of
[1:02:22] all prophets.
[1:02:24] Why was it so?
[1:02:28] Let's hear what the prophet says.
[1:02:33] John the greatest of all prophet, he was
[1:02:36] one that introduced Jesus.
[1:02:39] Jesus said he was greater than any man
[1:02:44] had been born.
[1:02:46] Did you ever think that why why that
[1:02:48] was?
[1:02:50] All the rest of them spoke of him.
[1:02:54] The word of the Lord come to a prophet.
[1:02:57] Does the bi the Bible said so? And in
[1:03:01] the other prophets in all the other
[1:03:03] prophets, it come to them in Ephesians.
[1:03:07] But when the word came to John, it was
[1:03:10] flesh.
[1:03:13] He is the one who introduced the
[1:03:15] Messiah.
[1:03:18] Jesus was the word. He is the word. He's
[1:03:21] always the word. But is where the
[1:03:24] fullness of God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:03:27] among us.
[1:03:37] When it came to him in the water, he was
[1:03:41] a prophet.
[1:03:46] And if the word made flesh, it is made
[1:03:50] flesh, it got to come to a prophet. The
[1:03:54] word
[1:03:55] wherever it is, it must come to a
[1:03:57] prophet because the prophet is the one
[1:04:01] the word comes to. And John was the
[1:04:03] prophet for that day.
[1:04:06] It's the same way. Even the word here,
[1:04:09] it comes to the pastor.
[1:04:12] You see the prophet said
[1:04:15] everyone should look for a church home
[1:04:18] church
[1:04:19] where is pastored.
[1:04:22] You look for a pastor who is able to
[1:04:24] pastor your needs and the pastor because
[1:04:27] every region is different. If you are in
[1:04:29] Northland, if you are in US, if you are
[1:04:31] in Kenya, if you in South Africa, it's
[1:04:33] totally different.
[1:04:35] And God
[1:04:38] comes in a mighty way to the pastor of
[1:04:40] that local church. And all the needs for
[1:04:43] that the people in that church are
[1:04:45] addressed through the pastor.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Let's look at Noah.
[1:05:02] When he looked
[1:05:04] away to see him,
[1:05:07] Noah saw
[1:05:09] the just judgments of God coming upon
[1:05:12] the people of this world who had
[1:05:14] rejected his word. That's what Noah saw.
[1:05:21] What about Moses?
[1:05:30] When Moses looked, he saw the a bush of
[1:05:34] fire, a pillar of fire had brought
[1:05:36] itself back in the bush. And when Moses
[1:05:41] Moses drawn close to it, he said, "Take
[1:05:44] off your shoes, for I am God."
[1:05:47] Now, if you would weigh that word, I am.
[1:05:52] It's past, it's past tense, present
[1:05:55] tense and future tense. I am eternal.
[1:06:01] I am e.
[1:06:04] I am. He saw the I am. That's what he
[1:06:09] saw in the burning bush.
[1:06:15] So the question is,
[1:06:18] what do you see when you look? Do you
[1:06:20] see in him when you look? Do you see
[1:06:23] that?
[1:06:25] Do you see that he was weded for
[1:06:28] transgression
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; with his stripes we were ill? When you
[1:06:32] look away, can you see that?
[1:06:36] Or can you just see one side of
[1:06:38] atonement?
[1:06:43] Can you see both sides of it? When you
[1:06:46] look if you look at it through the creed
[1:06:50] they will tell you the day of illing is
[1:06:52] passed
[1:06:54] but if you look at it through the word
[1:06:56] you will see he is the same yesterday
[1:06:58] today and forever. So people they will
[1:07:01] say ah he will used to ill people during
[1:07:04] the time of prophet
[1:07:07] and it's passed they are no healing now
[1:07:10] but illings are here
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; every Sunday we come here we see people
[1:07:14] coming here and getting healed
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; because he's the same
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; and he will remain the same until he's
[1:07:23] coming
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; we look at another example
[1:07:30] Job.
[1:07:37] He stood and looked.
[1:07:41] He seen his flesh, all corrupt, all
[1:07:44] corruption. He had seen blood over him.
[1:07:46] He seen the boils over him. His wife
[1:07:49] came to came. His church members left
[1:07:52] him and accused him of being a secret
[1:07:55] sinner. His wife came and said, "You
[1:07:58] look miserable.
[1:08:00] Look at the way you look. You keep on
[1:08:03] worshiping this gold and look.
[1:08:09] If you look if it was you as in human,
[1:08:14] you will start thinking is it true? Am I
[1:08:17] believing the right God or
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; but he looked at it differently.
[1:08:27] Then what did he say? Why don't you
[1:08:29] curse God and die?
[1:08:34] Instead of all this trouble you having,
[1:08:36] just cause cast God and die and finish
[1:08:39] all this trouble here
[1:08:41] forgetting that you will go again to
[1:08:43] another trouble.
[1:08:49] He said, "Thou speaketh
[1:08:53] like a foolish woman. The Lord gave and
[1:08:56] and the Lord taketh away.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord." And
[1:09:01] about that time when he had stayed with
[1:09:04] the word.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Then the lightning began to flash and
[1:09:08] the thunders rolled and the prophet
[1:09:10] looked and toward the sky and he said,
[1:09:13] "I know my redeemer liveth."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:16] Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; He will stand in the last days upon this
[1:09:20] earth. Though after the skin sworns have
[1:09:24] destroyed this body, yet in my flesh I
[1:09:27] know my redeemer liveth. Whom I shall
[1:09:30] see.
[1:09:36] We also had mother.
[1:09:38] When he looked, what did he see?
[1:09:48] He saw resurre resurrection.
[1:09:51] He was the resurrection and the life.
[1:09:54] Though he had been rejected and seemed
[1:09:56] delayed, when she finally looked at him,
[1:10:00] he found life. Jas also
[1:10:05] looked upon him and he also found
[1:10:07] resurre resurrection and life
[1:10:11] also. Then what did the disciples see
[1:10:14] when they looked
[1:10:19] when they were with Jesus and Jesus
[1:10:23] slept
[1:10:27] then they thought ah we've been
[1:10:30] fishermans for long so we know how to
[1:10:32] maneuver ourselves through the sea
[1:10:35] but it reached a point they had to look
[1:10:39] for someone
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and when their eyes were open. They
[1:10:43] looked at Jesus and they saw him walking
[1:10:45] on on water.
[1:10:51] So they saw El
[1:10:58] the angry people.
[1:11:01] They looked at him one day and they
[1:11:03] found sustaining bread.
[1:11:10] A type that angry today
[1:11:14] that the angry today can find the bread
[1:11:16] of life. Not find a creed. You don't
[1:11:19] find a founder. You don't find a
[1:11:22] reformer. You find life when you find
[1:11:26] Christ, the bread of life.
[1:11:33] We also add the thief at the cross.
[1:11:40] It was done.
[1:11:44] It was dying for his sins. He knew I
[1:11:47] have no problem.
[1:11:50] The two thieves we are fine. They knew
[1:11:52] ah we've committed all the crimes and
[1:11:55] this is it.
[1:11:57] But when he looked, what did he see?
[1:12:01] Remember me, Lord, thou when thou cometh
[1:12:05] into thy kingdom. Jesus said, "Today
[1:12:08] shalt thou be with me in paradise."
[1:12:12] That's what he saw in the hour of his
[1:12:15] death. So he had just few seconds for
[1:12:18] few minutes to die
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and just looking in the right direction
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; at the right time. God was there and he
[1:12:27] was saved. They were together in
[1:12:28] paradise.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't mean it doesn't matter
[1:12:33] what you do if you look at the right
[1:12:36] time at the right place which is the
[1:12:38] Lord Jesus.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; You save your life.
[1:12:46] What the sick saw?
[1:12:50] They saw Aila.
[1:12:53] The bllight looked and they could see.
[1:12:57] Depends on what you are looking at now.
[1:13:03] The poet.
[1:13:08] He looked one time
[1:13:12] and what did he see?
[1:13:16] You know, Fan Crosby was a blind man.
[1:13:22] If I can bring this
[1:13:25] I recite about him. He wrote more than
[1:13:28] 8,000s.
[1:13:31] So some of the most of the many we see
[1:13:36] he wrote them and he was blind since
[1:13:38] he's he was young. She was young.
[1:13:45] She wrote some of the famous songs like
[1:13:47] blessed assurance. Jesus is mine to be
[1:13:51] the glory. Pass me not, oh gentle
[1:13:54] savior. Jesus tenderly is calling safe
[1:13:58] in the arm of Jesus.
[1:14:02] But she was blind all her life.
[1:14:06] But
[1:14:08] one time before she died, she wrote,
[1:14:10] "Thou the stream of my comfort, more
[1:14:12] than life to me.
[1:14:15] Whom have I on earth beside thee? or
[1:14:18] whom in heaven but thee.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; We also had another
[1:14:28] Eddie Perro.
[1:14:31] He also wrote.
[1:14:36] So what happened with the Eddie Perro?
[1:14:40] He could not sell his songs.
[1:14:42] He had tried everything. His songs were
[1:14:44] not selling.
[1:14:47] But one time in his office
[1:14:52] he got an inspiration
[1:14:55] and what did when he took his pen to
[1:14:57] write? What did he write?
[1:15:00] Oh hail the power of Jesus name.
[1:15:03] Let the angels
[1:15:05] prostrate fall bring forth the royal dad
[1:15:08] and crown him Lord of all.
[1:15:16] We have someone else, the woman at the
[1:15:18] well.
[1:15:21] He got to look one time
[1:15:24] and what did she see?
[1:15:27] She expressed it in the city and she
[1:15:30] said, "Come and see a man who has told
[1:15:32] me things I've done.
[1:15:36] Isn't this the very Messiah?"
[1:15:40] when you took her first look when she
[1:15:43] took her first look at Jesus Christ, she
[1:15:46] saw the Messiah.
[1:15:49] So
[1:15:51] what must we see today?
[1:15:58] We know Jesus promised these things. He
[1:16:00] said, "As it was in the days of Lot,
[1:16:05] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:16:07] of man. So shall it be when he comes. We
[1:16:11] see these things happening
[1:16:16] also. God works in unusual ways.
[1:16:24] Think of Joseph
[1:16:28] Mary being pregnant
[1:16:30] and then he says it is of the Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit. It's very hard humanly to
[1:16:36] understand that.
[1:16:38] But that's how God works.
[1:16:52] Noah again
[1:16:55] the people
[1:16:58] are looking at a fanatic.
[1:17:01] They could not understand this old man
[1:17:03] has been building this thing
[1:17:06] since the last 10 years, 20 years. He is
[1:17:09] still building. He says there is rain
[1:17:11] that is going to come.
[1:17:14] The scientists try and look there's no
[1:17:17] rain in the skies. There's no clouds. It
[1:17:20] has never rained for a long time. So
[1:17:24] what is he talking about?
[1:17:28] So they saw him as a
[1:17:31] a fanatic,
[1:17:33] a so-called bot, a foolish old man
[1:17:36] against science and reason.
[1:17:39] They mocked him, piered him, and passed
[1:17:42] him by,
[1:17:46] not knowing that the very thing they
[1:17:48] mocked was the only God's way of escape.
[1:17:57] Then what did Pharaoh saw?
[1:18:10] He looked one time and he saw a fanatic
[1:18:13] also called a prophet, a slave claiming
[1:18:16] deliverance.
[1:18:18] He mocked him as insane. But Moses had
[1:18:22] the th says the Lord.
[1:18:25] The believers that is Aaron, Joshua and
[1:18:28] the rest of them,
[1:18:31] they saw God in Moses. For the words
[1:18:34] Moses did,
[1:18:37] it proved that God was with him.
[1:18:44] We have somebody else,
[1:18:50] the rich young ruler. What did he saw?
[1:18:55] When he looked,
[1:18:59] he saw the potentials,
[1:19:02] but his organization was greater than
[1:19:05] what he could do through it with it.
[1:19:09] When
[1:19:11] where is his next look?
[1:19:14] He was in L.
[1:19:19] He looked out of hell and judgment came
[1:19:22] to him. He was the next that is the next
[1:19:26] time he looked.
[1:19:28] Then he was asking for a drop of water
[1:19:31] just to quest just to touch his tongue.
[1:19:37] But it was there was a big gap between
[1:19:39] him and
[1:19:47] then the Roman soldier
[1:19:52] that helped nail him there had punched
[1:19:55] the sword through his art. Then he
[1:19:58] looked but it was too late.
[1:20:02] He realized it was this was the son of
[1:20:05] God. But it was too late. He looked and
[1:20:09] he believed, but it was too late for him
[1:20:12] to believe. What he had done had sealed
[1:20:15] his doom.
[1:20:17] He had run the spear through the
[1:20:19] savior's heart.
[1:20:21] It was too late.
[1:20:25] I wonder how many people how many Roman
[1:20:29] Romans today have done the same thing.
[1:20:35] You look you might look at somebody and
[1:20:38] but it might look too late. Many of
[1:20:42] today many of us today will come in the
[1:20:46] day
[1:20:54] Let me come to this
[1:21:01] and pilot. What happened?
[1:21:04] He looked at Jesus. He knew he was
[1:21:06] blameless.
[1:21:09] But he washed his hands but he could not
[1:21:11] do anything because of the politics of
[1:21:13] the time. He decided no
[1:21:17] let him be crucified.
[1:21:24] Judas also
[1:21:30] Jesus was crucified. He also took a look
[1:21:33] and he realized
[1:21:36] I've done the wrong thing. I went for
[1:21:39] the silver but this was the Lord Jesus
[1:21:42] Christ. So did the money help him? No.
[1:21:46] He went and he yanked himself.
[1:21:56] as we drive this home. Uh,
[1:21:59] one day a mother I'll just go through
[1:22:02] this story of this young man that this
[1:22:05] man one day young a mother mother's boy
[1:22:09] had been killed
[1:22:11] had killed a man. He was laying there
[1:22:14] ready to die in prison. So the mother
[1:22:18] stood at the governor's door
[1:22:20] brokenhearted.
[1:22:22] Her son was guilty. No question about
[1:22:25] it. This court had proved it. He
[1:22:28] deserved death under the law. Yet she
[1:22:31] knew something was greater than just
[1:22:34] than justice existed. And what was that?
[1:22:37] Mercy.
[1:22:39] She fell at the governor's feet and
[1:22:41] pleaded, not dying
[1:22:45] her son's guilty, not denying her son's
[1:22:49] guilty, but appealing to the only one
[1:22:53] who could pardon him. Our cry touched
[1:22:56] the governor so deeply that he did not
[1:22:59] send the messenger. He went himself to
[1:23:02] the prison. That's the governor there.
[1:23:05] He went himself to the prison.
[1:23:09] But what happened
[1:23:25] inside the cell said the ardent young
[1:23:28] boy rejected council and build a wall
[1:23:32] around his art.
[1:23:34] When the governor spoke, the boy refused
[1:23:37] to listen.
[1:23:39] "Get out of here," he said. "I don't
[1:23:42] want to hear it." Mi stood at his door
[1:23:45] and he turned it away. As the governor
[1:23:48] walked out, the guard asked, "Did you
[1:23:51] help him?"
[1:23:54] The governor replied, "No, he wouldn't
[1:23:57] listen."
[1:23:59] Then realization struck the young man.
[1:24:03] The boy grabbed the bus and cried, "Who
[1:24:06] was that?"
[1:24:18] Just a moment.
[1:24:23] That was the governor. He had come with
[1:24:26] your pardon.
[1:24:29] Too late. Then he screamed. He cried. He
[1:24:32] said, "Think of it the governing ear
[1:24:36] in the cell to pardon me, but I refused
[1:24:39] it all."
[1:24:46] Before they put
[1:24:48] the black mask on him after he had
[1:24:50] walked 30 steps, his last words were,
[1:24:56] "Think of it. The governor stood in my
[1:24:58] cell for pardoning and I turned it down.
[1:25:03] And what happened? They him because he
[1:25:06] refused a pardon. A pardon is not a
[1:25:08] pardon unless you accept it.
[1:25:18] And the last one.
[1:25:26] One morning, one of the greatest morning
[1:25:29] in the history of all time. In closing,
[1:25:33] I'm saying this, there's some something
[1:25:36] happening in the Jerusalem. And all at
[1:25:39] once, a bunch of soldiers came down to
[1:25:43] the jail. I can hear the jungle, the
[1:25:46] giggle of the chains
[1:25:50] here and dragging on the spear
[1:25:53] on the street. Who is that in there?
[1:25:56] Barabas asked.
[1:26:02] Is he's is ready to die. He's a thief.
[1:26:07] He's no good. He's a robber. He's a
[1:26:10] murderer. He's going to die. First thing
[1:26:13] you you know, he said, "Well, it is all
[1:26:19] in for me.
[1:26:21] It will be executed this morning.
[1:26:25] The first thing
[1:26:27] you know the guard opened the door.
[1:26:31] Step out Barabas.
[1:26:33] He stepped out and said well guess this
[1:26:37] is the end. He said Barabas you are
[1:26:40] absolutely free.
[1:26:44] He could not understand.
[1:26:48] You are free. I said, "How come I can be
[1:26:52] free? I've done all these things. How
[1:26:54] comes I can be free?"
[1:26:58] He said, "Come here. Look at that man up
[1:27:02] there.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; He took all your sins.
[1:27:07] He's he's ready to die for you."
[1:27:14] I wonder if all tonight could look and
[1:27:17] see that what Baraba saw. Someone taking
[1:27:21] our place.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He was weded for our transgression,
[1:27:26] bruised for our iniquity, the chestening
[1:27:29] of our peace
[1:27:32] was upon him. With his stripes, I was
[1:27:35] healed.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; You were healed.
[1:27:40] Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Wonder if
[1:27:44] we the guilty ones who should be sick
[1:27:48] can see him in our deliverance.
[1:27:59] Has the musician come?
[1:28:03] What am I trying to say? Is this that we
[1:28:08] see clearly fedicated word like pilot
[1:28:12] and the rest of them did like Roman
[1:28:14] soldier. But are you going to wait too
[1:28:19] long to do anything about it?
[1:28:24] He should
[1:28:26] ause the spear the other way. The door
[1:28:30] will be closed like it was in the days
[1:28:33] of Noah. and then it's too late.
[1:28:37] You might wake up
[1:28:40] some morning and say, "I intended to get
[1:28:43] out of this mess." Don't be too late.
[1:28:52] You better look and leave now.
[1:29:00] Is there one in here tonight would say,
[1:29:03] "Brother Brham,
[1:29:07] ask God to be merciful to me. I want to
[1:29:10] look and see him different.
[1:29:13] I've looked at him and guessed. I've
[1:29:16] looked at him and wondered. I've looked
[1:29:19] at him and questioned. Really? Did he
[1:29:23] care for me? Does he love me?
[1:29:29] Is all these things that seem
[1:29:33] that have been said about him, is it
[1:29:36] true?
[1:29:37] I want to know if it's true. Will you
[1:29:42] ask him to reveal it to me tonight?
[1:29:46] Will you raise your hands?
[1:29:49] Lord bless you.
[1:29:52] That's good. everywhere. Precious Lord,
[1:29:56] there is so much wrought about you. We
[1:29:59] know that you are the same yesterday,
[1:30:02] today and forever.
[1:30:04] We pray Lord that tonight when we look
[1:30:10] that we will see Jesus Christ.
[1:30:13] You promised in your word that the works
[1:30:19] that you did we would do al you we would
[1:30:22] do also. You promised in the last days
[1:30:26] that you would be back here on earth in
[1:30:30] the form of the Holy Spirit. The church
[1:30:32] would be full of power and Holy Spirit.
[1:30:39] You said a little while and it would it
[1:30:43] would do the world no good to look cuz
[1:30:48] they won't see it but you shall see it
[1:30:53] for it will be with you even in you to
[1:30:56] the consumation.
[1:30:58] Lord Jesus,
[1:31:00] while there is still an opportunity for
[1:31:02] a man to look, may they look tonight and
[1:31:05] see him in his power of resurrection.
[1:31:09] He is not dead, but he is life forever
[1:31:13] more, ready to make intercession for
[1:31:16] those who are ready to confess him.
[1:31:20] Grant it, Lord, in the name of our Lord
[1:31:23] Jesus.
[1:31:27] can give us a song as the pastor comes.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine.
[1:31:42] Oh, what
[1:31:45] takes all glory
[1:31:52] of salvation,
[1:31:56] purchase of God,
[1:32:00] born of his spirit
[1:32:04] and washed in his blood.
[1:32:10] This is my story.
[1:32:15] This is my song.
[1:32:19] Praising my savior
[1:32:24] all the day long.
[1:32:28] This is my story.
[1:32:33] This is my song.
[1:32:37] I'm praising the Savior
[1:32:42] all the day long.
[1:32:46] Perfect submission,
[1:32:51] perfect delight,
[1:32:55] visions ofture
[1:32:59] now burst on my side.
[1:33:05] Angels descending
