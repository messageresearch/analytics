evening saints welcome to the house of the lord it is wednesday night another battle with the enemy another day that went past busy week hectic world everything just seems like it's stacked against us but we got promises and i believe after sunday that the lord has just raised that standard a little bit higher because the enemy always comes in and he thinks i might have just one on them for now but then the lord comes in and is merciful and true and faithful and he just comes in and he settles things that that's in our hearts that we need to to either have answers on nor and and that's why we come we come here not for anyone else but him it's good to have all of you here and i don't think it will ever be the same without you once you've met family you know they they're just your family but it's at the end of the day it's all about him so let's go and and come tonight and just give god the glory for everything he's done he is doing and he's going to do for us amen and i think if you if you approach a sovereign god on a sovereign ground which is holy and the only thing you have to offer him is your everything not hold one thing back like brother andy says when we sing leave everything there when we worship worship with all that you have the rest of the world will continue the rest of the week will come and it will go like many before but now is our time amen so let's all just stand up and we just opening a word of prayer i believe great things are going to happen tonight amen i came expectingly i think the lord is definitely just ramping everything up in his time amen our gracious heavenly father what a privilege lord lord we love you and we really do come here lord not because of anything but you that drew us first lord and sometimes we might sit here and have a lot of battles in our heads lord jesus and a lot of things we're still trying to figure out lord but i pray thee lord jesus tonight may you just lift us up that little bit higher lord like those slaves that were on the top of the mountain lord looking over the promise of the sun shining the next morning lord where they are free when that jubilee trumpet sounded lord and they just could see lord the sun shining on their hands and as you were rising up lord they knew they were free lord so much more lord let all of us just go to that top of that mountain tonight lord fly above everything

revelation would sink that no that they know that they know lord that you have the battle lord everything belongs to you thank you it's a privilege to stand at this time lord we ask with brother munpo tonight lord is he going to come and preach and share the word lord just take the man out of the way lord and let him deliver that male that you've given him lord from that cloud lord jesus to come

praise thy faithfulness tonight even the father our ways cannot express that enough our ways are not sufficient further to express how how great thy faithfulness has been to us and will always be we take this opportunity further to to praise your name to worship you we take this opportunity further to think back at calvary of what you have done for us and what it means to us for you are the only one who a faithful father even until the very cross calvary we thank you this evening lord we just want to give you all the honor and all the glory as you come in your presence now father in the name of our lord jesus christ i pray with thanksgiving amen amen i greet you this evening all of you in the name of our lord jesus christ uh do you mind you can just have us have some seats just for it for a little bit if it's fine if it's okay with you just say it's a way of fair and this is a way of settling me down a bit because um i don't know why i agree to comment i don't know i honestly don't know if you don't mind i just want to sing this song and with the musicians together and you um it talks about in times like this in times like this you need a savior amen i'm not very good with tunes or keys i just want to to sing it as it came to my heart amen are you happy tonight oh yes all right let's let me sing this song we don't have to see we don't sing the whole song since little we just sing two stanzas perhaps if you see me stop that means we are done amen i'm sorry about that please join us where you came for the for the glory and honor of the lord amen in times like this email is it all right in times like this is that in times like these you need in times like these you need an air be very sure be and grips this holy drop oh this rock is jesus yes he's the one this rock is jesus the only one [Music] solely drawn in times like this i need a bible [Music] in times like this very very short and grips the solid rock oh this rock is jesus yes he's the one all this rock is jesus and he's the only one i say be very sure and be very very sure [Music] let me cut it there it goes it goes further but for the sake of time let's just leave it there i believe the lord enjoyed the song because you have enjoyed it praise the lord i i let me release the musicians thank you so much god bless you i would like to to bow to each and every one of you but i'll give one bow for all of you hallelujah all right tonight brothers and sisters i'm very um you you think you are ready to stand before the people and you find that that you are actually not ready i don't know of any man who can say he's bold and ready that he can stand here because this place of the pulpit is not an easy place the the sacred desk is not a place to take for granted it's not a place to take it light so we the ministers or the preachers are actually even at a more riskier position to stand here and mislead someone to stand here and not live their life to stand here and and bring attitudes before the pulpit so the minister is actually at a very big risk just for your information amen so i believe tonight that you have prayed for me how many have prayed for me and for those hands that did not stay up but okay i'm closing my eyes for the hands that did not stay up i believe you prayed for the minister that the lord can use him to speak to you amen hallelujah so we're going to read the word of god tonight and i believe we are not going to be long while we stand let us read my friends have got a presentation over there then i will just make sure that i put this um just forgive me stop watch yes then the stopwatch will tell me how far have i really taken of your time let us pray together the prophet said in the word that you can eat too much you can walk too much you can think too much you can drive too much everything you can do it too much but you will never pray too much let us let us come before the lord heavenly father once again great eternal and mighty jehovah lord we are still regurgitating the atmosphere of sunday we are still father god thinking about how privileged we are that you the god who made the heavens and the earth could take his time and think about me a wretched man a man who is born through sex through sin through a sinful way that you god can take time to bring me in your thoughts heavenly father we are lifting our hearts and our hands before you in as much as lord i don't take this place for granted lord in as much as i don't take it light lord i believe your children also they are not taking their their cease for granted i believe that your children my father my god are not taking the privilege to be in your presence lightly and that is why we invite you lord jesus that is why lord we welcome you because you promised in your way that where two or three are gathered heavenly father you will be there i pray tonight lord that you will send the divine presence that will come and touch each one it is not me lord i am nothing i'm nothing before you lord only you are something father that is why you can even take a stone a dead wood and utilize it lord to bless your people to take someone and give them eternal life and that is why lord i ask that you put me out of this place set me aside lord jesus and let you operate tonight let it not be me and my thoughts but you and your thoughts lord jesus and if i cannot let me sit down that is my prayer tonight lord jesus father god i pray that you bless your children bless their hearts let the word that will come lord uplift them encourage them let it reveal who they are father god is our prayer this evening even as we read your word lord we want to be in one sweet accord in one harmony let by the god the symphony of heaven come and synthesize everything oh lord we commit even our little ones lord we are aware that the holy spirit is very sensitive we are aware that the spirit of god oh lord jesus is so sensitive and i pray that lord you just bring us in one sweet accord that lord we can be one mind lord that those needs can be delivered tonight that those diseases will run away from us that those burdens father god tonight lord jesus can be oh lord jesus be brought to your altar for deliverance that those father god that have got challenges in the individual lives lord that those challenges can be demystified we pray father god knowing that the name of the lord jesus is a mighty and a strong tower which your children can run into and they are safe lord jesus bring everyone father god in one mind as we pray now we commit the service into thy beautiful and mighty eternal health the name of our lord jesus christ i pray amen amen that is our topic tonight i don't know call it topic or title that is our title tonight and the seat is not air with the shark are you completely out yet amen of the shack that's the question am i out of the shack tonight or i'm still trying to come out but the seat is not air with there that is that is the title tonight let's read the scripture okay oh i must put it on first sorry old school we call them the btos born before technology what do they call them right we are going to read galatians chapter 4 and we sit down we'll read the rest of the scriptures while we are while we are that's my way for me to see whether we are together the more i try to get settled the more i i get just just remember me in your prayers amen colossians chapter 4 i thought i was there but i'm here now by the grace of god let's read verse 27 are you there colossians chapter 4 from verse 27 then we sit down so it is written rejoice now barren that bear is not break forth and cry now that surveillance note for the desolate had many more children than she which had a husband now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise but as then had he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now that's right nevertheless what fire the scripture cast out the bond woman and her son for the son of the born woman shall not be aired with the son of their free woman that says the bible verse 31 so then brethren we are not children of the bold woman but of them free hallelujah we may enjoy the comfort of your seats while i remain standing amen amen we're going to speak about the seed it's not air with a shark tonight and i'll try my best not to keep you long and i'll try not to be dramatic i'll try i'll try to be calm and uh let's read the second peter verse second peter chapter one sorry i should have made myself print out here because i can't fully see there despite my glasses so repeat second peter one second peter one amen five to eight how many are there second peter one and beside this giving all diligence add to faith your virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen for for if these things be in you and abound you understand the meaning of the word abound you are all english isn't it and abound in other ways in big quantity obviously if i can put it that way am i an abound they make you that he shall neither be barren no and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ we all know as believers that the knowledge of jesus christ is not like the knowledge i read in the book or the knowledge for a computer or the knowledge for a keyboard it's not that knowledge the knowledge of jesus christ is to know him in the power of resurrection bible readers are you here in the power of his resurrection are we together let's proceed they make you that you shall neither be barren nor fruitful and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that look at these things is blind can you hear that is a very harsh statement yeah because it has just mentioned very very very important things there faith we have it it will bring you to your virtue your virtue knowledge your knowledge temperance your temper we have ordered them but the bible says if you look at those things that is a hard statement the bible doesn't say if you look at some of them right if you look at those things you are blind but remember you are a daughter of god you have those things you need to be able to use the faith of abraham our father that you have those things and god will bring them to manifestation that is the key this evening the purpose of the message is not to show you how bad you are the purpose of the message is to show you who you are in a bad state did anyone catch that the purpose of the message is to to show us who we are to reveal to manifest who we are in the state which we are currently to bring the reality that we had on sunday the reality of who we are that is the purpose of the message that is what the prophet sometimes despite the fact that he wants to be soft and and you know just calm just polish up people but he find himself having to say hard things why because he who what does the bible say the one that i love i i chastise why would a shepherd go and just break the food of a sheep is there a sensible shepherd who can do that and just go out and break it we understand why isn't it let's move on with that chapter so that we can carry on with our message um but he that look at these things is blind and cannot see afar can see but cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was perished from his old sins this is hard but it's the truth wherefore the rather brethren give diligence this is now in order for you to have those things that are mentioned above wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things if you do these things you shall never fall never and that is a promise that is a promise brothers and sisters you receive it like that it happens like that i mean let's be realistic this is a way to start let's be realistic if an unbeliever who does not know god can go out there and write a book you know i was reading i was talking to my wife about that book of seven habits of highly effective people it's one of my favorite favorite books that i read long time ago and it had an impact in my personal management in my efficiency in my day-to-day if if an unbeliever can write things that will make your life better naturally daily basis how to manage your time how to manage your life how to manage your emotions how to do things if an unbeliever without the holy ghost can do that how much can the word of god do how much can do it of good if an unbeliever can talk to people and the people apply what he says and they change in their lives they succeed in their businesses they succeed in their way day-to-day life in terms of emotions just from an ordinary talking addressing the outside and people work on that and change what can the word of god do that is why paul is there says that if we do these things we shall never fall and that is a promise because even the devil can try to do things at a flesh level although we know that he's a son of petition he's a liar and a father of lies but people because we were gifted by god we will hear as we proceed that the lord the lord even though he came the way that we came but he still blessed our way of living here in the flesh he still blesses us though we are we are living not in a real perfect plan of god so let's move on and read one more scripture what did i say yeah i didn't write today but i said we are going to read matthew 24 yes i didn't type it for you but i can freely and happily read it for you matthew 24. we know he died who knows it by heart we know it by heart matthew 24 it says 24 24 for they shall rise false christ and false prophets now this is the time now that the bible is talking about they shall rise he tell he told us then and this is the time when they're rising and he says and shall show great signs i like this scripture and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the relations of these scripture brothers and sisters is i want to link it to our message this evening i want to i want to ask you to just as a setting i want us to think uh the message that the prophet preached he preached two sermons the seat is not there with the shark twice in the same year one before the seals i believe one after the seals but that's not the point the point is uh he he spoke a lot you'll hear as we proceed he spoke a lot about the bride the seat you know that you are the seed you are the bright you are the bride you right now that's why i get so nervous that's why i get so unsettled that's why i almost found the past and said man of god i'm sorry because i'm not just talking to ordinary people and the the more i should be aware the better for me and for you so i'm not just talking to in ordinary people you are not just ordinary people and if you are aware and realize this point the the benefit that you are going to take from the word will be so so enormous because you are not just ordinary people so the point is this uh i want to take an angle that is slightly slightly different from how the prophet brought it but but i'll try to to stick to what the prophet said but you'll see what i'm trying to say he spoke about on you know about how the seed cannot air with a shark we all know what the seed is right okay we'll come back to this but that is the seat of the wheat yeah that is wheat i hope shut up shut up cattle stop don't sue me for using that picture and this is this is this is the stock and the tassel for wheat and you can see this is the actual seed here this is the actual seed but is is is if you open that shark there you'll find that there's a seed inside there if you this is this whole thing everything here grows up and get dry and get bent by the sun for the sake of this this one sometimes you can actually mistake it and then take it together with a shark because you think it's a shock you see this is after after after maybe it has been treated but you can see this seat is not purely purely worked out there's still a lot of shock there if you just take it and go plant it you'll have problems because that's it those some of them some of them you can see them you see like this one some of them they they they see some of them but some of them you can see they're still they're still covered they're still like this they're still like this can you see them are you seeing them little ones are we together little ones are we together yes you know the lord jesus said not these little ones and he was referring also to others so this this is this is the shark you know and and sometimes if if you are not careful you can actually think that the city is out of the shark meanwhile the seat is not out or the sharks have left the seat but that shark it it can look so much like the seat to a point whereby you can mistake it for a seat and that is why the bible says or the prophet chose this message and the question is why did the prophet choose the shark why didn't the prophet say that the seed cannot be uh with the tassel right why didn't the prophet say that it is because it is because of matthew 24 matthew 24 says they are going to be very deceptive very close to a point whereby you can actually miss misjudge and say ah this is a true prophet this one referring to a wrong one i can't i can't say them by names right so you can mistake him but the point is this what i want to do tonight is that i want us to look at this in a more different angle at an individual level right we know that god is perfected in three right now if god is affected in three i want us to look at it sorry brother i want us to look at the insight because the actual seat is the inside the actual seat of god is your soul are we together that is the actual that is what god is interested in god is not interested in the shark or the tassel what is not interested in your flesh outside no he's more interested in the seat and that is why your soul and the flesh cannot air together and that's the thought this evening and that is why i want us to look at this plant called you huh that has got the tassel that has got the shark and the seed inside i want us to look at that to check whether uh this plant wha wha what is the shock what is the state of this seat right now huh is it ready to be is it ripened to be harvested is it out of the shark or is not it's not yet because the sun is busy burning the sun the reapers are here to rip all of the seeds right what are those things that the shark brings the shark brings all sorts of things with it it's very creepy it's very hard it's not soft like that's picture that i showed you i want us to look at an individual space to see what are those things that are really disturbing or that are encroaching they make sure it sits are we dead are we together yeah are we together right the bride is made up of individuals and what i'm trying to say there is that it it is not we don't just say the bride no the bride is made out of people people who've got individual lives we know that we are a body maybe i'm a hand or i'm a nail maybe i'm a i'm a part called the pancreas which is right inside is a very soft part huh that is why the lord put it inside maybe maybe i'm i'm i'm i'm a tooth sister esther can tell you how sensitive the root of their tooth is very sensitive if any of you ever broke their tooth and you inhale your dream cold water you'll know that you drink on the side if it's broken this way because it's sensitive it touches the nerves it goes so each and every part you know we are a body in that body each and every part must come to maturity each and every one must come to a state of nature because if it cannot the whole body get in the steps but there is a responsibility on each and every part that is why my right foot or right hand is stronger than my left with someone who's left-handed his left hand is stronger than the right one like brother andy you see like my friend apes you see those guys are left-handed but each and every part in the body have got a responsibility uniquely and specified to that particular part and one mistake impacts the body right now are we in agreement one little mistake or one little part one little state of immaturity can affect the body but the body itself when the part itself has to be fully measured me and you in our own individual space in our own relationship with the lord has to be at a point whereby now when the whole body when everybody gets to the state where we are mature now the whole body now what happens we see who we are then we the rapture takes and we go home that's all what we need that is why i was telling somebody that what happened on sunday one day be careful one day the lord is gonna do something right here i'm expecting it to happen one day the lord is gonna do something and and you don't want to find yourself on this side of the line you need to be on this side of the line so that when something that something happened because it is going to happen amen i promise you it will happen okay let me leave it there but the lord was going to do something he's preparing to do something right here in chicago when he does that something you need to be out of the shack are we together we need to be in your own state of maturity which means this is the time it's not the time to be looking to the left or to the right or to it's not the time for that it's time for you to be fully focused with all your mind your soul and your body me included remember my policy is very straightforward everything that i say here i'm referring to myself and to give you when you grow when you grow up they used to say when you buy something you know the shop owner will give you pasel i don't know what you call it in your language the shop owner will give you you know if it's children you will give them stocks with if they came to buy yeah freebie free good you know the point here is we need to be able to take the word of god so serious yes that it will bring us to a state of maturity and then um sorry brother today my state of nervousness is thank you sir thank you thank you very much god bless you my brother now i i wrote there in red that is not much about what i say or what i do it's not much about it that is important but it's not much about that it is about what i say what what does it come what does it bring out in the end it's about what you say and what you do daily me you into that what we do daily what are the results of that you see it's about the life that is brought by those thoughts those actions those speeches whatever you do so you need to be able not just to to to to to be you know okay we'll get there but our lives need to be able to bring the fruits so it's not much about what we say and what we do that's that's that's what i said just to set up the sin why did the prophet i spoke about that that he chose the shark because it is so close to the seat and it is actually the ultimate final thing that brings the seed out that protects the seed throughout right now this shark this if this is the shock of my spirit inside there there is a seat that is what god is interested in but the lord is housing it in this body right but this body has got nothing to do with heaven just imagine if there was this body i was going to protest but because i'm not this body i don't care sorry to use that weight but my soul is the one that the lord is interested in it is the one that the lord wants it to come to maturity to where he saw it before the foundation of their wealth in my individual life let's not think about church now we can read the spoken word the seed cannot be aired with a shark two of them the prophet may very clear but here i want us to take an anger that says me as an individual will i take certain things in my life to heaven what will i take nothing when i say me i'm gonna change things now i mean my soul me me my soul because this is not me what you are looking at will i take anything to heaven me brother for the real ones the soul not this place this guy is just just housing me the real me will what will i take why are other things still attached to me that are not going to heaven why why the things that are not going to the barn of harvest like the shark why why are they taking so long to be blasted out why that is the question the word of god is his thoughts expressed are we together now jesus christ the bible says in john chapter one he is the word he was the one who was at the beginning the logos right and if you and me not if we were in his mind which means we were his thoughts and which means we are god's word me and you are god's way just like jesus christ is god's sweat that means me and you must come to a point where we look exactly like jesus christ are we together that is where this seed has to come because jesus christ himself you will see now he's the seed okay let me go for what let me jump the pictures have you enjoyed the pictures little guys malacca did you like them do you understand what the city is my boy that is the seat there and there's a seat and there's a shark the seat must come out and the shark remains but the shock is only used to house their seat the real seat the real malachi who is the same age as me he's inside there that is exciting malacca isn't it right this is someone i've just i've used those spoken words i might have not covered everything but i've used those spoken ways to capture the thought tonight amen let's go through what the prophet says sorry i'm gonna turn my back because i cannot see my screen and it's no one is to blame i should have made those that formed much bigger now that's why i'm so strongly today the prophet is now putting a disclaimer he says that is why he sounds hard sometimes why and i thought this would be a good time because i don't know how much longer will we'll be together maybe i could i could some way god would help me to show the reason that i'm i'm so family denounced organized religion and i want to post this in my previous semen i spoke about not the previous the one before we spoke about a religious spirit who remembers that same one we were speaking about that because there's a danger of of of of having your own religion right here in the church right there in the service you find that you are you are a member you love the believers we love you and everything and i come here and i greet and i even preach to you but i formed my own little religion inside there's no life huh that is very dangerous and that is why that is what i want to to to re-contextualize this point organize religion in me i just come to church i'm just bound to come to church there's nothing saying why are you going to check is there progress in my spiritual life what is happening i appreciate the challenges lord we need to come to a point where we say lord thank you for the tests and trials because the bible says those things they are the ones that do what my bible read us that the trials and temptations they are the ones that perfect us they are the ones that actually we need to appreciate them amen they are not nice but a two seed will come to a point that says lord thank you for these titles and temptations because you promise that they can come in their thousands but you take me through all of them that is the attitude of the believer they can bring them on bring them on that's what you must tell the devil say come on david bring because you are challenging that seed to reach its own state of maturity you are challenging you are provoking the seed to reach the state of maturity before you know it you are going to be surprised on the things that you will do in the lord you are going to speak things into existence before you know it that is what is going to happen the more concentrated and concentrated you are me and you are the mature the sooner measured we will get in the lord amen so religious spirit organized religion organized i can't that is discouraged the prophet it will come in the message the main target is not the denominations the main target the devil might have attacked and caused havoc throughout the ages but the main target is the seat this seat yet that is the main target and let me bring it home the main target is you as an individual glory he's going to individualize you yeah the devil is going to be personal at you yes have you ever had someone saying that please don't be personal no no the devil is going to be personal he's going to attack you personally and customize your trials yes for you say well done devil bring more right it cannot be aired with the original program organized religion it can't and that is why the prophet lambasted and blasted so much because organized organization is not of god it is of man right i've made a little diagram there and some of them is not what the prophet said some of them is what the lord told me when i read the scripture and i read the spoken word but this is how the picture is we know that god is perfected in three right water blood and life according to john first john 5 7 right the bible says the three agree in one please let me just again put my own disclaimer i am not saying the the pattern that i have put these things this is exactly how they are i've just i'm just trying to show you a picture that god is perfected in three right water blood life the three agree in one that talks about the perfection of god right body this one flesh i didn't want just to write body because the policies there's many bodies i wanted to write flesh to specify that i'm i'm talking about this guy sinful guy right flesh spirit soul three ishmael which is who is the physical seat of abraham arena agreement isaac also the physical city of abraham but the difference between the two as we all know is that one is of a bond woman as we have read and one is of a free woman one is a promised son and one that's not really pros not promised was ishmael promised no ismar is not a son of promise he was a son of idolatry the prophet says you can go read it he came through adultery okay i'll leave it there but the real son hallelujah is the lord jesus that is the real seed of abraham which did not come through any combination of father and mother which is your soul that is your soul whoever gave birth to your soul it's not mum and dad no ways will just incubate us to bring you to earth and another one was just a a channel which is the father there's a channel to bring this seed to show this young man called liam but actually the true seed of god is the soul inside him is the soul inside me inside analysis inside fen each one of you your souls are the real seed jesus christ was the real seed of abraham a faith seed right justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit wait bright baptism of the holy spirit brings the word bride which is me and you sister baker is it true are we in agreement are we together father son and holy ghost they are one they are talking about one but that one is the one operating in our days so that we when we have that one we can actually we can't go through the rapture without the holy spirit that is why we need to make our salvation sure that is why we need to be sure and be very sure as the song says that our anchor is holding no woman i've ever had that had a baby you can ask our sister's dad and they don't know it right i'll be amazed they know that there's a baby and that baby is coming and he's alive and it's growing amen hey no some of us brothers we must take it by faith because we'll never be a sister but they know ask them they know even what the father knows right they know it because it is the reality of the actual seed that is inside right so fathers and then goes world church and bread those are that's what i wrote there because the world is there and then there's a church denominational church right and there is a right that's how the sequence is that is why i wrote the stock the tassel and the shark but the prophet says the shank is not the seed the shag is only the carrier the shark is only the carrier if he goes further the prophet and say it and says luda wesley pentecost but pentecost was not the seed the seed is what came out of pentecost today's word bride which is you that is why you are extremely important and the sooner we know it the better look at this look at what pentecost has done pentacles have done so much for the seat so much i'm gonna try to i'll be okay now pentecost have have have put so much effort the spirit of god ever so much through pentecost that for the bride to be where it is today the shark that's the shark it it shielded that seat and out of that shark come out now the actual seed that needs to be harvested and that's why pentecost is this one the brother brand name says it this one we can go and read it haga sarah mary mary was not the seed yeah he is the shark the prophet says she was only but the the difference now with mary is this you see is this one that i want to show you if you look at number three the difference with mary is that mary she's holding inside a part of the bride who's that part of the bread is jesus christ or if i put it this way you'll agree with me you are part of jesus christ right but mary inside him again we always sorry i great means isn't it we always say god is not complete without us so jesus christ is not complete without his bride so mary had another part of us or we are another part of what was inside mary if i put it that way we agree i want to see you again if i put it that way we agree we we were represented in mary by the lord jesus christ we now mary had inside she was just an incubator the exciting thing about mary is she did not go like sarah and hager she went by faith nobody met mary she was not married we all know the story right that is how mary delivered the lord jesus christ the holy spirit came in here and came up with that seed and delivered the seed this thing is really today bothering me my apologies i used to see people putting a solid tape there on your cheek thank you my brother the enemy is not happy i'm sure but the point is that mary was the carrier of the seed which is the lord jesus christ same as pentecost was the carrier the shark is also a carrier of the actual seat that comes and that seed it is you this bright year that i'm talking about this is us brothers and sisters and that is why i want us to focus on that that is why i want us to focus on just those three focus on your soul let's focus on the soul that is the key thing this evening that we need to be able to putting a lot of our effort and energy and time on that is what we need to be the bride is us you are part of the we are not complete as the bride without you you are not complete without me so there shouldn't be any the body should be working with the body with other parts of the body in harmony in order for the bride to reach his full maturity that is otherwise we are we we want god to to to bring us more how can i put it more pleasure i don't have a better way but god will because we are the seat we've got no choice in this matter you have to come to a point of maturity whether you like it or not because god chose you it is not you who decided that me now i'm gonna save the lord yes you did because god gave you a free moral agency but god made you that way to decide about him amen the whole picture everything has been planned and a pre-planned before to play out like this that is why we cannot judge anyone among us that is why we can't be judgmental we can rather be supportive we can be motivating we can be encouraging right even when you correct your brother you don't just cut and nade and nail it no you do it with love the bible says you take a lot of dose of love to correct him inside of you not outside saying brother i love you i want you to change no no no right inside while you're still alone going to correct your brother going to show him you go with a dose of love enough and sufficient enough to be able to win back your brother to be able to release him from where he is or your system you don't just say it out widely because as i said at the beginning it's not about much of what i say someone told me that you know what before you come to anyone or do anything that there's already an atmosphere behind you coming with you to do what you're going to do so be careful by saying things outwardly they must come from inside because what comes from inside is more powerful more stronger it can change things unlike what comes from outside and that can only come from the soul that can only can come from the bride an unbeliever can come here or a denominational person will never be able to produce what you as the bride produces because you are the true seed of god therefore when we go through challenges one thing that we must guarantee or assure ourselves with thank you lord i am the seat thank you lord i am the bride it doesn't matter what the devil does it does not matter very soon actually we are very privileged that we are put at the end of the relay you know a relay have you ever run athletics when you you are running in the athletics there are others who start yes and they hold a baton and they give you to the next line the next line we are on the last part amen we have been so much privileged because somebody had to run like paul that's how we say it in in africa rebecca we don't say rock we say somebody had to run faster faster to pass the devil so that me and you at the end we receive our baton what how are we going to run them just yeah yeah paul has run our race we won already we don't have to run no somebody suffered so much and ran a race so we have to double up the speed we cannot behave and live as if somebody i mean we'll we'll just be yeah what what's the scripture says throwing our pelvis to the swines you know have ever somebody done something so nice for you and you just lightly say okay thanks huh it's really discouraging it hurts yeah it's discouraging if somebody do something for you you you you bring the level of thanks to that person that equals what that person is because brother ahman did it for me out of his heart he just go and put a new chain on my trailer new i don't have to pay anything what must i say to him massachusetts oh yeah no i wanted to do it also ah that's not thanksgiving that is not thanksgiving that is like i'm just taking my brother's efforts and say oh whatever yeah that is attitude and we cannot do that to paul and all of the of the of the racers that lays before us including our lord and yet we call ourselves the bacon the top the cream the cream all those people that are spoken in in hebrews chapter 11 that they them could not receive their promise they couldn't receive their promise because you had to come first and you must be very important people now realize this that you are important be aware that you are important very much important that people who are so faithful more than me suffer so much and say god show me this thing because the bible told you the bible told me that if you let anything ask yes ask it why are we not asking because if we we must be asking to a point the lord will never be tired and we will receive it and ask and keep asking knock and keep knocking and believe then that will come because we are now focused into this thing that the lord have said lord i'm not moving because this is your weight otherwise show me something else lord that this is not your promise but as far as i'm i'm concerned where i'm standing you said i must ask for a job and i had a job as far as i'm concerned you said i am healed lord despite my pain you said i am healed by your stripes so what must i back off why if the bible said everything that you love the prophet said and everything that you love and god showed him she showed it to him god god showed him his maurice chair a chair in heaven he showed it to him because he knew the prophet loved it man if the prophet can give god can give the prophet a horse something without a soul brothers and sisters let's think again yeah this is very this is too important this is too important to to to to for us to be holding and pulling each other on getting involved with us no no this is so important we can do those things we can entertain one another we can do but this is so crucial that it must be our first priority in life this seat must come out pure and perfect anything on the way one side anything on the way one side that should be preoccupying our minds and our thoughts every day we should be teaching our children the same thing they should be knowing that hey the influence at school i am not part of those things i'm not part of the things at school i am a stranger i am an odd person i must be known like that that i am a strange person when when my colleagues see me at work they must know ah that's the strange guy the unbeliever god i mean the believer guy god you want to come and pray for us that's how the attitude should be there's this oh the odd guy with me there's the old guy from africa yeah they should know you like that but hey this is the guy that every time we want to have lunch he says he's praying first that's the christian guy they should make jokes about you then you know that you are you are actually getting your you put in the harvest in the barn your seat is at the point where it is going to give you what we read in second peter chapter one temperance virtue long suffering love everything will come to the point because if you don't have them or if you just ignore pursuing to have them then you're blind you're still blood unfortunately but we are privileged people to be told that that's what we need to focus on to get our salvation ready at individual level we can form a religion that's what i've already said ourselves right i want to make sure my time is right today just to say you can just be like just like a church goer yeah and just go to church the problem is this many times we we don't want to do what you call self-introspection right i wanted to introspect literally and she sees that she wants to introspect me but the word is being preached the prophet that i listen to the tape when the prophet corrects something or shows me something i said yeah and i saw my daddy doing this it's for you each and every seat has got a responsibility to get measured there's no part in the body that i know that this part is response that that my head is response sometimes it can substitute my heart and pump and pump the blood in the body i've never heard of such no part each and every part is called a duty a responsibility to fulfill that which the lord has put for that part for that seat to get ripened isn't it to get ripened no fruit in our lives and we don't get worried about it we come we go we don't have the fruits we don't have the burden to go and preach to the people we don't bother to do some other things for the lord and what worries me we don't get bothered that is a big concern for the lord i think because we must come to a point where we bring fruits in our lives and those fruits come in big numbers do you know that one seed that i've shown you at the beginning if you plant it how many corns are going to come out of it that's right you are the rivers of joy will flow out of you that suppose the flow out of me you will be a life-giving christian you the prophet somewhere says sometimes we give that like the brother ben was saying sometimes you give the devil too much credit you know the devil has got a dashboard he's got a dashboard for each and every one of us a dashboard that dashboard he analyzed each and every one of us and he analyzed it according to our weaknesses and our strengths the devil is not going to come to you and attack you on when you are strong no he is only according to his dashboard analysis his graphs tell him that ah that one attack him here that one attacking me that one just make him shallow just make him okay no fruit good fine no problem he doesn't bother anyone he or she he's just a good believer who comes here but no fruits no no no bother about fruits but these are wonderful people that that the lord has brought us to these are good our pastor is exceptional man our brothers and sisters everyone but there's no fruit coming and i'm not bothered why there's a problem somewhere i must be concerned that lord where are my fruits when am i getting to maturity level when is my seat coming out of the shop when is the shark leaving me the shark must leave me we cannot come here to church every sunday and then you sleep what must brother ben think the brother spent sleepless nights leaving his family praying and fasting for you i'm sorry to talk like that then you sleep my brother and my sister or you start to think about other things you allow the devil to bring it to your mind no let it not be found in chicana tabernacle you children especially one day i'll call you by name from the front and they say brother sorry so please wake up would that be nice but i'll allow the pastor to do that i'll be championing my my my boundaries [Music] but the point i'm trying to bring brothers and sisters is that this is so serious yes because any weakness in the system i don't want to call it a system it you know a chain it affects the strength of the other ones you make others to pull hard we used to to to put donkeys on a donkey cart maybe four or six in a row three three with a long rope you control them but some donkey in the middle will just decide just just to just walk no doesn't pull nothing and everyone is pulling man people are praying they're suffering children one must be restored back here in the assembly in the in the fold and you are you are just walking you're just that you know what we used to do with that donkey we used we used to whip it hard we whip it until you whip it and you'll see it because it needs to it needs to understand that my job is to save my master and i must pull this card full of load because if i don't pull my mates are suffering if i don't pull the lord jesus suffered for nothing if i don't pray at home every day and read my bible every day i'm causing a problem because we are part of an assembly we are a part of a body and one way you may dispute me but we are connected with one another we are a body of believers what i do affects andy what andy does when he prays i get a blessing i get a benefit man so if he does not pray i lose my benefit of the area where i'm weak because he could be strong in something if armament prays so hard and fast and it's the chantel does not i'm sorry mama and she does not do she makes it hard for him and vice versa so we are supposed to pull as one solid friend draw a big circle around your brother and your sister the prophet in the book of hebrews he says draw a big circle for your brother for you a big one draw it yes you see the brother wants to cut you out of the second you draw a big one amen to bring him inside because he's your brother he's your sister without him forget about the rapture forget about heaven right because if that man is the old sister is a genuine seed of god and is behaving like that it is your job forget about him your job sometimes things happen among among us and i'm closing and we look at brothers and sisters and say shame he's going through a hard time and we forget brother chris that ah that problem is not for that brother no it's not for that sister it is actually for you and for me the lord put a sister here who goes through difficult times and he wants to see what are we going to do about it he knows my seat is going to talk like sister haiti right my seat is going to say this brother will be healed and confess and pray for him and ask the lord to remind you when you are in a private prayer to remember that prayer to remember that person to be concerned about that person i'm going this way but i'm talking about the seat i just happened to touch this part i don't know why but that is the truth that we need to be so concerned about one another so loving genuinely that your problem must be my problem your situation sister k must be my situation for real not only when i see you not only only when you come to church or when you send a message on whatsapp i say oh i put the little two hands like this that i'll pray for you but i'll go and don't pray for you and what kind of a part am i yeah what kind of a seat am i and i don't even mention one word while i'm busy working that lord jesus even this request for sister king lord i know i'm busy but lord i'm not busy in my soul for you helps it i carry on this problem my jesus i know you can do it that the boss called you said yes boss you don't have to go and be kneeling all the time then the lord listen to the prayer because your prayer is a sacrifice that is why david said day and night i'll i'll meditate about you lord because the more i meditate about you you come down the more you meditate about god the more god preoccupied preoccupies your mind brother mario and even when you are working you know then the lord come in that situation and he helps you to undercut you know me and mario needs to undercut a lot of flaws to undercut them [Laughter] i'll tell you one day what undercuts me but the lord will just make your way on those things but now we must be sensitive enough to the spirit to see when the lord is in operation yes the angel must not pass here and we don't feel it we don't see nothing that's the spirit of god one is moving we must this is another seminar together brother andy maybe we appreciate that when the spirit of the lord talks when it moves we must be able to connect with it to see but hey this is the devil this is the spirit of god and act accordingly yeah that's another same one all together but the point is that we mustn't be self-protective and let self-introspection i know all these things that i'm saying i'm preaching to the converted i know it's a refresher you know on the computer there's a little button like this with an arrow you know if you want your computer to update you just click your scissor no then you see your computer going and updating everything that's what i'm doing here tonight i know you know these things but the enemy still exists and maybe might not be meant for you maybe it's meant for someone who needs it but be careful take everything digest it look at it do an introspection forget about the minister who was ministering it go and read the spoken word then the lord will deal with your heart amen hallelujah if ishmael and isaac could not be higher they could not air together because the original plan of god was substituted into a permissive plan of god permissive way that god did bless ah god bless the permissive will remember i said earlier on but we've got gifts physically speaking i know isaac wanna say that i said if i want something you know to think and innovative i must go to him what is this gift he does not have to go to university or anything i know if i want brother chris and he said brother you know that there's this land that is like this and the seas i know he's going to draw it like that i know it's his gift so god blessed even us in the physical he blessed us he blessed us but it was not his original plan but he's still blessed didn't he bless ishmael he did but this man is not the seed of god sorry denominational the the denominationals god blessed them did he didn't he brought us all roberts and them billy graham and all those people don't didn't they pray for the sick and they get healed that is why the prophet attitude was like that to them but it's not like the prophet did not know that they are the shock he knew now neither can the spiritual and the natural be us together our natural must be subject to our spirituality not the other way around why because our nation cannot air together with our spiritual i'm closing now just one word misinterpreted caused every sickness death that we have ever had well if god who is wholly locked down and caused all these skills by just slightly misinterpreting one way and any little thing against that supreme weight caused all this chaos and the suffering bleeding dying of his own son to reconcile this horrible thing back to him if god did that and we want to justify the breaking of this that's one way how are we going to get in anything less than keeping his hold fully how are we going to manage brothers and sisters the time is at hand we come to this earth the way that we come not in the original plan of god it was only permitted by god also amen like that like he blessed ishmael but that was not this original plan that we've already spoke about an individual level at individual level we can form a religion i already spoke about that i'm sorry to repeat myself what i want to say is that okay i already spoke about those things i can't even give you the presentation to read that's the way the people who profess christ now this is what i was trying to caution you earlier on that we mustn't be like that that we become christians who just look like christians you know there's there's one thing to just to look like to be part of the flow it's not everything that is flowing in the hard river that is part of the hard river so many things are in there but they don't belong there somewhere along the line the river kicks them out somewhere along the line they get washed out the dead wood somewhere everything that is not part of the pure water of the hard river goes out so a christian must be a christian full stop are we together but you've got to have christ on the inside of you the weight and it comes by hearing not just there's a difference between hearing and listening i might confuse the meaning but there's a difference we need to hear the word of god listen and hear it which is the way it made manifest or it will never mature into a real bible believing christian you will be a christian but you'll never get to a natural little danny did you say amen you'll never get to death because why you are not absorbing and eating the weight of god daily it will always be a denomination inside me i'll i'm just causing a denomination here in church in this in the because now today i don't think the focus is still really in the denominations right now we have come to the end of the end where everything must break or stand yes because we are at the very end we can see things are happening around the world countries china there every everyone it's like something's just about to but but but then how how can we just be so calm in our spirits and not like nothing is happening we can't this will just not only be a beautiful building the prophet here talks about what i mentioned earlier on that that if we are saying the beauty of the church is the character like like it says here what is it the beauty of the church is the character of the people it's also here somewhere on our world the pastor put nice things we must read them those things it says one of them says the beauty of the church is the character of the people not the character of the system yeah or whatever it is but the people and the people when we say we are a people we mean that we are individuals my character most character feminist character analysis character all of us rebecca malacca the list goes on and on until brother james our characters forms the church and brings their beauty one piece of that beauty cut out that's what the prophet says in conclusion remember there was no mercy's promise through a woman anyway after mary and there is no more denominations promised after pentecost that's what the prophet says and i agree with him it's now we're waiting for the rapture we are waiting for the bride to rapture and go home we are waiting for the seat to go out of the shack and he's out go and you know when they come out they're very interesting sometimes you find them even on the floor because they could not stand any more under the inside the shower sorry they can't if you check those seats if you're really a farmer and you've experienced some of these things some of the seeds you know like sunflower because it's so hot and they are ripe they're ready to go and the best come and eat them on the floor they just pop out of the shark those seeds they just rapture they just left out when the farmer comes he just cut those things he just go and beat those that were still wanting to stick in the shark the farmer beat them wisdom the farmer did you see him did i show you the farmer at the beginning beating them because they didn't want to come out of the shark and if they are ready the farmer wasn't there and they come out you go home right that's what you want the lord to do that to come here i don't want that lord i want to be ready help me my father to be ready for you to go home amen rapture is it is the rapture and bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again that's what we are waiting for the character of a church is not not just a group thing no it's not a mob thing you know a mob it's not it's not a good we are not the mop but we cannot approach our characters through our church because now we'll only be talking example maybe we'll just choose a brother for the ben or pastor but the film you know just to just choose those that we believe are you know and let them represent no no no each and every one myself that character of jesus christ from pastor to the small one same character so that we can rapture it's not just a group thing it is a character of each and every single individual contributing to the character of the church it's only it only gets beautiful it only gets beautiful when the individuals get beautiful and can i tell you what you are beautiful you are beautiful that beauty is coming and the lord is pulling it it's coming all the someone's coming here all the tapes you're listening all the way all the the testing for the word is pulling the beauty bringing it to maturity they see it and that's what we need to strive and to push for every single day of our lives if no one someone don't want to do it but what we must do we must compel them yeah the lord sent send those guys to go and compel them he compelled with wisdom not fighting them but we must tell them that hey brother you will read your bible every day in my house you will read it because i'm a son of god otherwise i'm going to compel you even through prayer you will pray sister anariz isn't it michael but i know you do because you love the lord amen so brothers and sisters that's all that i have for tonight and is i've just gone over one hour 10 minutes 11 to be exact and i want to say to god bless you all i thought that you have you have been blessed it was not meant to uh to be to rob you the wrong way it was meant to encourage you to say pause let's think about these things let's think about really you know this reality i was so blessed on sunday that when i came through here i still felt the atmosphere i still felt that the presence of the lord is here i wanted to propose to the pastor that we can can we just start having two services every sunday i'm
