want we do the same thing but it's not as extravagant as you I think we've been doing it for 40 years and we've kind of run out of steam but you guys are fresh at it so you you can come down and teach us a few things and uh certainly good to catch up with friends I hadn't met and became new friends and for those of you who have known for years and uh Linley she's well she goes way way back yeah sh don't tell how long Okay and we're just glad to see too that your church is normal right I like it yeah yeah because you know you preach a sermon like that and you think somebody's mad at you they don't show up for the next one and now I'm going to show them how they can get there right and then now they don't want to learn how they get there okay well but uh we know people have commitments and different things and we understand that and yeah I vowed never to go onto the online but I've done that and um but yeah we still isolate ourselves because you 40 years ago God called me and uh we were driving home one night and we'd been going in the town for six years to a church there mess's church and we're driving home one night and I've been seeking God because I knew I had a gift I knew I God wanted me to do something I didn't know how it was going to happen we did all sorts of things we did the airplane of Lind remember that we flew into the paddock next to lindley's place or in the Fielding or Lavin area and preached there we went into Wellington we preached here we went up to terango oh we we went all over the place and because I thought well maybe he wants an itinerate Ministry out of me and so I thought I'd do that and uh we got home and we barely paid the bill for the airplane for the two weeks we were away so I knew that wasn't right I had a young family I couldn't do that and live and then coming home one night this little church has been sitting there for over a hundred years God said there's your building I turned around now our sons one of the boys maybe one you have one of these kids one of the boys was he wore his heart on his sleeve so he didn't think too much of what he was going to say he just said it so he was sleeping in the because he had an old HQ helden station wagon he was sleeping in the back as we were on the back seat anyway and we pulled into the thing he goes Dad where are you going I said God's just spoke to me he says all right all he wanted to do was go home and go to bed right because we were an hour out of Christ Church and so uh I pulled in there to the old church the sign was laying in the grass it's uh was built in8 1899 I lifted it up it said Methodist church so I went and I got a hold of the Methodist Minister that lives in rura and I said I want to use your church for an Outreach and so that's how it all started but you know I knew God had called me there and he made a way now let me just give you a short testimony with this so we were in that church for 25 years we had 11 people when it came time to buy the church because they offered it for sale after almost nine years they offered it for sale to us you guys are thinking of building $20,000 was all we could scrape together and so we did we put an offer in for $220,000 the circuit writer Methodist circuit riter accountant says to little or 17 we offered him 17 we had 20 he said go up a little bit higher so we we went to 20 he said I think they'll take it they took it we went in to sign the papers over put the trustees and everything down for the new building a 100-year old building and he said Somebody's Watching Over You because that day that we signed it they just got a new GV of $31,000 and all we had was 20 and we bought that thing for 20,000 we were there for 25 years amen that's God right for 25 years we were there so we went into Kaio then because our church had grown so much and it was on the main road and it was 100K going by the church and we had young kids we had old people and and I just I just thought somebody's going to get hit here so we started we made our way into Kaio and looked around God gave us a building there in Kaio we purchased it we purchased it for 385 385,000 and uh and we never had insurance but we had to to have insurance now because we had a building you couldn't insure the other one it was too old if the fire got started it would burned down before they got the fire engines there right in the country so we have got an insurance on it we paid Insurance $2,500 a year for insurance for two years the earthquake came just after we put all the money into it built it up got it going some of you may even have been there for the dedication and it went down we got back 485,000 we then uh went ahead and put another 70,000 in it to make it right our latest GV 2.9 Million amen we're debt-free now we we no longer have earthquake insurance because it's too expensive it's five grand just for what we had for 2 and a half thousand has jumped to 5 grand a year so we're taking any extra money we got we're putting it away should there be another earthquake and to doubly seal that when we built the building the brothers poured the foundation and we poured the foundation it was supposed to be 70 MERS of concrete going into the floor with the floating rib Foundation when we finished we had 104 square meters of concrete go into the floor it is valued or it is rated at a 9-point earthquake will withstand the 9-point earthquake W so hey we're set and we're almost so we're just thankful that God has been so faithful to us over the years right just started off very simple so have courage believe God and no telling what he might do for you I know you're not going to get a building for 20 grand I I I realize that but uh you know have believe in God right okay let's uh let's go to our Bibles tonight and let's go in chapter two or um 2 Chronicles 510 and just kind of sort of bring out what we started with um in the Judgment seat because we talked to you about not size and thing we'll we'll kind of just do a brief overlay and then and and bring you up to Spade so that we actually see where the reward is okay 2 Corinthians 5:10 for we all must appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he hath done whether it be good or bad let's pray together Heavenly Father we ask you to help us now as we want to deliver this Lord Jesus we're thankful for the wonderful time we've had we thankful for the Sisters here that have provided such a wonderful lunch and brother Bon's invitation we ask you to bless this church mightily for we ask it in Jesus mighty name bless your word now as we begin to minister it in jesus' name amen God bless you may be seated so if we don't get to the Judgment bar or the Judgment seat of Christ we end up in the the Lake of Fire so let's let's just briefly go through uh let's see if I get control yeah it's thinking about it come on baby don't want to lose my anointing it's got the ghost lows move move the okay yeah let's see if I can get right so here's where we left off right we are the three-fold Judgment of every believer every believer has got to go through this right everyone's got so there comes a time when you give your life to Christ and because he's given your life to Christ and he has taken our sin then our judgment is passed I no longer stand before him as a sinner that don't mean I don't get changed but it just means my sin question is dealt with that's right then we go to the next thought which is we're judged as a son and when we're judged as a son now now we see that it's the present day and we see that it's a repentance a confession and a chastisement and the chastisement is because he's trying to get us he brings something to mind and you don't pay attention amen oh me right amen or ow me one or the other you you finally realize okay amen or ow me oh my I'm in trouble so we see then that it it brings you to a place of chastisement and chastisement isn't because he doesn't love you it is because he loves you so the mere fact that he wants to correct you you should go thank you Jesus amen he wants to correct you and you need to take that correction because he's trying to show it to you and so he he we take that correction right and then the next one is we is are we are judged as a a servant which is a future we learned so let's go through that just briefly again 1 Corinthians 3:1 the foundation for another Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ so if your foundation is solid in Christ it's going to stand amen and that's how the foolish Church gets to the other side right now they may have a right they have a good foundation but they may not have a right baptism right so they're not going to get the wedding garment so you know there's different things that would not would eliminate them from going further but if their Foundation is true because you there are some genuine Christians out there who don't believe the message yeah right yeah okay let's go a little further then uh verse 12 now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones hay or wood hay stubble so we realize then that these six things that we have ability to build upon are all dealing with how we live our Christian Life and if I'm going to live it for the glory of God I'm going to build it with precious things rather than wood hay and stubble because we know the fire we see here is going to try it so we go to the next verse for every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and and the fire shall try every man's work what sort it is and if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward but if any man's work shall be burned up he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so by fire so why is he saved his foundation his foundation was correct now what he built on was not correct and so the fire is going to check that and it's going to burn turn that up and he's going to suffer loss but he himself will be saved that's why when you go to Revelation 7:14 where you see that who are these These are they who have come out of Great Tribulation and made their robes white in the blood of the lamb and they're Before the Throne of God day and night and they serve him right now if you go before the seals into the church age Book You'll see brother brandham said that was the bride but this before the seals and then after the seals he realizes they are serving God where the bride rules and reigns with God right so there were two different classes and so that's why it's so important that when you build a Doctrine in the message you got to make it fit the old old where he was at that time versus where he came to after the Book of Revelations because now the book has been open yeah and when the book was open now the revelation comes so that brother brandham could correct what was wrong yeah and he made it right so now we have and you know I did that to my church because you know sometimes when you preach so long at one place they kind of go to sleep on you so I said see brother Bram said that's and they all knew it was wrong and they're all going he's gone off the rails again Bo and I says okay what's the difference and and then one guy say oh it's prior to seals right exactly so we know then that we compare what was preached before the seals compared to what was preached after the seals so we get the balance on where he's at because brother brandham grew in his understanding that's right right if you remember the first seal he said in the first seal he says he he wrote it all out figured out all what it was supposed to be and then the angel came said you're wrong here here here corrected here here here why because now he's opening the word to the prophet that's right which you know I believe brother brandom studied hard to figure out what it was but that was all he had a revelation just for an exercise for you go go to Google not I'm not trying to get you to be a Google light but go to Google and put in seven seal chart there is a myriad of seven seal charts and none of them match brother brandom's teaching none of them and they're all over the show the Mormons felt he would come in 1911 well they missed that one that's right so you know there's just so much that we we are so thankful for and we'll get into that in a few moments because of God opening the word to our understanding okay so we see here that it's going to be it's going to be service which is works and it's also going to be sort not size and that's important and we're going to show you that as we go down through okay let's go to the next next slide here then and as we go to the next slide Jesus tells us here to lay ourselves up in Treasure in heaven right so in Matthew 6: 19 Jesus says lay not up for yourself treasure upon Earth where moth and rust do corrupt but where thieves break through to steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust death corrupt where neither where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be so what are we talking about what treasure are we talking about how do we know what the treasure is is it an Earthly treasure it's got to be a spiritual thing doesn't it but what would be the treasure how can I know that there's going to be something there how can I be sure that when I get there it hasn't been in vain right I don't want to get there and go well you did a great job but depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you because there'll be many people like that we prophesied your name we done wonderful works in your name he said I don't know you why because they didn't do it the right way not that they didn't do it they did it but they did it the wrong way so we need to know what what treasure am I going to have there how do I get this treasure if it's not Earthly treasure what is it so one of the first ones we see here then is that it's really dealing with uh the treasure in uh what have I got here our treasure okay it's dealing when Hebrews 6 verse 10 for God is Not unrighteous to forget your Works your labor of love which ye have shed toward his name in that he ministered to the Saints and do minister so God pays attention to everything you do for the Kingdom right that's where your treasure comes is doing for the kingdom and this is so hard uh for us to get to a place to well is this Kingdom stuff or is this just me and and we see then as we as we think about this thought the Bible says and I thought let me see if I can go back one because I look oh can you give me can you move my mouse and give it back to the pre previous one right there good okay here's what brother Bram says here I must have skipped that slide all too little time is spent on laboring for Eternal rewards of God all too little time is spent notice little time is spent for Eternal rewards the recompense of God is to lightly esteemed so we're not pushing enough on what the rewards are we're pushing more on being right with God but what are the rewards are then he goes on if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and the Eternal Kingdom of the of the substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available for the faithful Saints now when you look at that thought then what would those treasures be let's go to Matthew 16 verse 27 stay with me on this one so in Matthew 16:27 he says he says to him there he says for the son of man shall come in his glory of his father with his Holy Angels then he shall reward every man according to his works so the reward comes when he comes so what's the reward going to be well let's look at a little bit fether differently then so Revelations 22 at the very last chapter of the Bible it says behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give to every man according to his Works shall be so once again he in Matthew he talks about a reward in the Book of Revelations he talks about a reward so how do I get to the place of reward so who are the Sunday School teachers here huh you a Sunday school teacher you a Sunday school teacher so how do you reward your children for do you do memory memorization of scripture Memory verses huh yeah okay so what do you do to give a reward for your children a star their name on the board something huh a what a sweet kids are going to have bad teeth but you know we we it we humanly give rewards for when things are done that's why the Bible talks about it because only things that we do here on Earth are what really are going to be rewarded in heaven why do you think we have S and Dames and that sort of stuff it's all a pattern of what is going to happen in the heavens and when brother brandom stepped forward he they you know he was so humble he says well these can't be brandom no it's your converts right it's for the work you did it's not because of who you are it's for what you did for the Kingdom so we we see here now that we want to C well what how do I know what I supposed to do well that's where we have to count on what God says to do so the Old Testament for uh our our Testament of to other people should be that we serve whoever it is right like the man who was caught there in the on the the way to Jericho and all the religious guys passed him by but the Samaritan went and and helped him out so he was the one that Jesus spotted on that would get a reward because he did the right thing and so that's where I gave you the scripture now go with me to Matthew 10 because this is an interesting one and I'm not going to get totally into some of the doctrinal side of this but I I just want to drop this in so in Matthew 10 ver 40 so Matthew 10:40 says he that receiveth you receiveth me right so people even receiving you receive Christ but then it better be Christ not you right don't want it to be you you want it really to be Christ but look what he says here now and he said he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward so now you are you getting it this is where the rewards come is your service and it's not the amount cuz how I haven't got a cup here have I no oh well I got a bottle you know just a cup of cold water that's all required to receive a reward well we know it's got to be more than that right but it's got to be done in the name of God it's got to be done with the love of God expressed right just somebody says I'm thirsty well you know give him a drink but if you give him a drink with God in mind now you now you're doing something something that God will pay attention to okay so we see then as we go through this thought here that it's an interesting concept that to receive a reward for just giving a cup of cold water so that's not size remember that's sort not size so it doesn't take a lot to get a reward go a little further let's let's do a quote or two here so no matter how little or how small things that you would you do in his name he knows all about it it might seem insignificant but yet if it's done in his name no matter how little he once said if you give to one of these my servants as much as a cup of cold water only in the name of his disciple verily verily I say unto you you shall not lose your reward so it doesn't matter how little that you do Christ always sees the little things that you do and I am so glad that you that aren't you that he sees the little things we do so you know you don't have to be a missionary you don't have to go into the jungles and sleep with all the you know one year one year we were in vanatu and we went into the to the jungles there and and uh next minute we hear the drums going over on the next Ridge the drums are answering yeah and over here they would answer back so I said to the guy that went with me I said go to the Deacon and find out what those drums mean CU vanatu in the island of Pentecost they're only one generation from boiling people so you know we want to make sure we're not the we're not the what's on the menu right so my Deacon at that time he went to the guy and he he he says to him uh what what's all about the drums and the Deacon just smiled that's kind of scary right is he smiling because could be good and you know I'm carrying a little extra weight so it' be night and fat and Sassy so but you know we we we just do whatever we can for the kingdom of God no matter what it is but you don't have to do that just a little cup of cold water is a reward but you do it in his name that's what it's all about his name not my name his name amen here's a question brother brandom have you time can you please explain Matthew 10:41 I would like to know what is a prophet's reward so what's a prophet's reward right let's see what he says well now Jesus said whosoever receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet receive a prophet's reward a prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet okay yeah I'm a friend aren't you right it's more than that let's say whosoever receiv re a righteous man in our name of a righteous man receive a righteous man reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is oh we're getting close now is to be a friend to the prophecy that's a reward he's your friend like the shunamite it might come in handy sometimes see I did it did with her see Watch God's servants so did he answer answer it he did but you it's kind of laying underneath the surface he didn't come out and tell you exactly what you needed to do but what would it be well thank God we he sent a prophet right cuz where would we be what church would we go to if we didn't have a prophet to tell us what's going to happen at the end that's a reward otherwise you be tied up with some denomination somewhere you'd love God because you're predestinated to love God but you would be caught up with some other denomination some other thinking and you won't get the reward that God has for you because he sent a a prophet to give you reward and when you look at the shite woman that's exactly what happened yeah that's right she obeyed the prophet she got the reward amen that's right hallelujah oh [Laughter] okay so Jesus says in Matthew 2540 the king shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you've done it unto the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me so it's just the least of the people the reward comes so it's not about doing it to a a well-known name or a well-known church or anything like that that it's just where does God want me to help where does God want me to bless I want to do that let's go to the next one use what God gives us okay go with me to Matthew 25 because this is a this is a touchy one because it's talking about the kingdom of heaven and Jesus begins to tell them about the kingdom of heaven and he said says to him here he says to him there for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his servants 25:14 who called his servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one now watch here's the key verse key part of the verse every man according to his ability and straight away took his journey so he hasn't put anything on you that you can't handle right he don't expect you to do something that is somebody who is totally talented that's why I said just be faithful not successful he he's put on you what you can handle you be faithful in what you can handle that's all it's required amen and so we see then that each one the five the two and the one were all given according to their ability and you know the story don't you to what what they did with it okay so I I won't go through that but we'll we'll take it a little bit further let's go to verse 20 and bring it on down so he that had received five talents brought five other talents right so now the Lord's coming back for the reward and the Lord deliver unto him me five talents and behold I have gained beside them five talents more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the Lord so the guy was faithful in five and he doubled it and so God was very pleased with that and he gave him a reward for that you've been faithful there you're going to get a reward well done then verse 25 we go down to the guy who don't only had one and I was afraid and I went and I hid the town and the Earth and lo thou H has said thou hast thou Hast that is thine and the Lord answered and said unto him thou Wicked and slothful servant so even with the one who only had one Talent cuz you know I don't know maybe maybe you don't have a church mouse do you have a church mouse I have a church mouse you know oh don't oh I you know I'm I'm so so weak and me you know I just I just want to serve the Lord you know and some people just don't oh I'm not capable I could never do that he doesn't call you to do what I can do he doesn't call you to do what some big name could do he calls you what you can do nothing more amen you know he just lays on you what you can do not anything else and so we need to realize that even if we only have one Talent we need to use the talent towards the kingdom of God right because if we use it towards the kingdom of God there's a reward amen now you all want a reward right I'm speaking to reward Believers right okay so I want you to understand this only whatever he gives you to do you do be faith F you get the reward so the Bible tells us we've got time yes oh precious time only in our generation that we don't have enough time right we run out of time every time could play on words huh so we we see here that the Bible tells us that we have time but the Bible also tells us in Psalm 9 90:12 teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom then over in Ephesians it says Ephesians 516 it says redeem the time because the days are evil so you know we need to pay attention to what we do with time now do we have time wasters here I'm not talking about you but we have time waste things we can be involved in right and if we're not careful we get hooked by that and we'll waste our time doing stuff that's not productive for the kingdom oh but I'm just a little sheep and you know nobody pays any attention to me don't justify it God's given you a talent use the talent don't just say well you know brother so and so is better at that sister so and so is better at that God has given it for you so we need to pay attention to our time amen what else can we say that God has given us well this is my thinking let's see he's given us abilities right so talents god-given abilities so what's your god-given ability now some of you are quite smart gone how many You' gone to University come on you guys don't be afraid to come on show us how you got gone to University well I graduated from high school but that's as far as I got right and uh you know my dad never graduated but I graduated so you know that's something but you know is that my God given ability not necessarily so if we'll look at it here in a moment that he has given you an ability for the church you could be a blessing in the church well how would how would I know well I can give you a test I can give you a test tell you what your talents are so let's go a little further with this go with me to 1 Corinthians 12 say this is talking about the gifts now we all want the gifts to operate don't we genuine Holy Ghost gifts operating in the assembly right we want it genuine you don't want the fake we want the genuine article and so often we look at the genuine article as being an outward display of something to where everybody sees it like prophecy and for over 40 years we've had tongues and interpretation in our church when was needed not every service but when it was needed so somebody's going through a a rough time or needing some advice the tongues interpretation will come out and tell them exactly what's going to happen and what they need to do that's true tongues interpretation that what brother Brown taught us because it's it's meeting the need at that point not yeah I say unto you there's somebody here in the back row with a backache where's the sister with a backache that we pray for this morning because you know I mean there's you're going to find somebody with backaches you're going to find somebody with different things I mean that's not directive that's why brother Bram says you yeah right he pointed it out it was direct amen so we see here now is we look at this thought in 1 Corinthians 12 it says now there are diversities of gifts so that means multitudes more than one but the Same Spirit there's diversities of administration so that means it can come in several different ways and but it's the same Lord and there's diversities of operations so now it doesn't necessarily have to happen at church right because you know you're only on church on Sunday and maybe Wednesday but it can happen anytime right because there's diversities of operations okay let's go a little further with this thing but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so every one of you have been given something for the kingdom of God at least one Talent okay so how do I know what talent is go with me to uh Romans 12 Romans 12 and we're going to pick up in verse you're going to pick up in verse six then having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry ministering or he that teacheth on teaching he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness so there's seven gifts there and the prophecy one is really a p i like to you know we get a little scared if we call it prophecy because you know we probably don't prophesy but we can be perceivers in other words God's given you a spirit of discernment to see what's wrong and what's right and you're quick to pick that up your person only has to walk in the room have any of you ever met George Smith he was married to Rebecca B brandom okay so he came to my church and we're in the back fixing things up for the supper in the evening and uh he's greeting some of the people and he comes to me he says you're going to have trouble with that one and that one and that one I said yeah I know and he was absolutely right he had a spirit of discernment by talking with the people to he could see that there were problems there that could be a problem within the church right so the perceivers perceive things then we have the server and the server generally works out as a a sister but we've have some brothers that are useful usually deacons and you know the we've got several in our church and the minute the kitchen is open for things to happen those girls are there and they're into it and they're fixing and they're fussing and they're carrying on why because the gift that God has given them is serving and that's all they know how to do but they got to be careful because if they come to your house they'll rearrange your whole house without even asking you know because the gift is just there and they've got to do it man I just oh this needs picking up that need's cleaning out oh oh look at this this needs fixing up that's what they do right so there's a there's a spiritual way to use it and a carnal way to use it right okay so now we got that then we've got the teacher who teaches and that's kind of what I'm doing here but I'm also an exhorter so I exhort you to do the right thing right and that's that's a gift amen and and you know we need each one of these and he's not only going to just use you once throw you away because we're in a throwaway Society right use something once throw it away no he he can keep using you just stay Supple say God take this gift you've given me let me be a blessing even though it's only one Talent let me be a blessing in your to the church amen and then we've got we've got the organizer give him a project poof all organized run smoothly brother Kubin I would think that you would be one you haven't done the test yet but I I see that in you already I'm not prophesying okay but I I just by discernment I'm I I see that in you so we there's people that just do it automatic now I can do it but it doesn't come naturally and you can do it cuz all seven gifts would should be in our our lives right but there'll be one that's way out ahead because God gave it to you for the body has a talent to use for the Kingdom so like I said I can give you a test you can find out what you are I had a Canadian girl in Eugene's Church and they were going back to Saskatchewan and she said I haven't got my gift I don't know what I am and I said sister you'll still make the Rapture it's okay but you know because they they want want to be used I mean we all want to be used right yeah amen so but take that gift because there's diversities there's different operations there's ways that God can use you that you're unexpecting to happen and it'll happen and then there's the mercy at the end and the mercy is the person that provides Comfort to people they see somebody hurting and they immediately go and they identify with them and they they they pray with them and they they cry with them and they do Mercy things in fact when I did it in Eugene's Church there was a man there that was just retiring from working in the hospital as an orderly he said my whole life I've wondered why when I'm pushing people down the hallway they're pouring their lives out to me he said I now realize God gave me a gift of Mercy to pray for the people to help the people see the gift is there you just need to identify what it is and then say God take this this talent that you have given me and use it for the kingdom of God because I know that it will finally bring a reward it might be small but still I'm using I'm being faithful right the faithful than little things he'll give you the big things okay so let's go along a little bit further in 1 Peter 4:1 it says every man hath received a GI the gift now that's not only salvation even so Minister the same one to another as good Steward stewards of the manifold grace of God so you've been given a gift to use for the kingdom and why not use it why not use it for God's Kingdom and the last one is treasure so on 1 Corinthians 16 verse TW 2 it says upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God has prospered him that there be no Gathering when I come so he's talking about being faithful in your tithing he's talking about giving to the Lord right and we've been given that gift of a job right if you don't have a job pray for a job cuz God wants you to work so pray for a job that God would give you a job that you could give back to the Lord and you know you can started as young ones now it's going to be a little harder maybe for some of no it shouldn't be any harder you you'll be you're creative like when our kids were small we worked on a sheep station so there wasn't you know they had their chores one of the boys would Milk The Cow and the other boy would bring the cow back in when he got out of school from the school bus he walked up the up the lane and bring the cow back in separate the cow from the calf and and then the oldest boy would Milk The Cow in the morning and he let the hens out so he collect the leg eggs and so there was jobs to do but they wanted extra pocket money there was plucking dead sheep now you probably never heard of this so when the Sheep dies and it blows up the the wool will come away from the skin but you got to have rubber gloves because it stinks he stinketh and and so I would tell the boys where I'd found dead sheep on the farm and they would go and they take a gunny sack and a j Sack or something and they would go and they would pick up the wool and put it in and step it down and get it firm and then they leave it by a Gateway so when I came by with a tractor I'd pick the wool up and then they would bring it to the uh yards where we were at and then the wool buyer would come around once a month and he would buy their wool then that was their money and we taught them to tithe on that money now that money was hard it wasn't easy money to get and their mother wouldn't let them in the house after they after they've been plucking dead cheap right they had to sit outside take their clothes off outside and then come in and have a shower because they stunk right but it was still their way of earning money pocket money and they paid their tithing unto the Lord before they were even Christians we taught them to tithe and it's a good principle because we see here that if we go to Proverbs 3:9 it says honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thy in of all thy increase so shall thy barns be filled with py and thy press shall burst out with new wine wow now you know we had an earthquake right 10 years ago now or more how many is it Mar you 10 mom 2012 11 10 how much am I bid 10 okay so we had this earthquake took out our church H Margie lost her house K Adams lost her house MERS lost their house Jeff and Jane lost their house anybody else there were five of them that lost houses John John and it was wasn't married then John Ward huh it was his rental but yeah he it was it went down with a quake so been faithful all her life what'd you end up with more money than what you paid for God was faithful right each one of those five people that had been faithful in their tithing when it came time the earthquake commission paid them back more than what the house was worth so that's God right they would have never got that without the Quake Mary probably never been here without the Quake either she probably still been down down home but you know God is so faithful and this is the good thing about being an old person you watch it happen over years years it doesn't happen in the blink it takes years for this stuff to unfold and then you look back and you go wow God was faithful all the way back there and brought it right through now there was a guy that didn't pay ties so he lost his house too it was a rental and he struggled and he struggled to find another house and he's still struggling to find a house and I think he's paying over $500 a week now for rent but you know when God is being honored with the first fruits of your being God will bless you may take a while to see it but when it comes to Crunch God's there amen amen the reward comes through okay but being that it's given the hundred and something $17 brother Brown's received an offering something the Brethren told me thank you my precious friend I will take that straight to the mission field to feed the hungry children see them laying on the street with their little belly swell up from starvation doing everything I can to make it count and at that day when the rewards are given out you will see where it went God ever bless you that's a portion of your living that we share with others so see you don't see it sometimes you might not even see the reward until right at the end and just because you did that you do it unto the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me okay let's go a little more personal now so how do I where do I get my reward okay so we're in a race now this is a few Olympics back because I don't think our Olympic Champions or Olympic Golds any longer um and husin bolt certainly isn't running anymore he he cannot run the fastest guy now but you know he was fast in his day and he was a trainer and so Paul used the thought here and we see it pick it up in uh 1 Corinthians 9:24 where he says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain so Paul is showing here that we're in a race amen and it's not him that starts it's him that finishes and you know over the years we've done quite a few things for the Lord and one of the things was we had youth camps back in 1990 so back back in 1990 we we gathered the young people in that time which are now old and uh and and we had youth camps for them and so the realizing that after all those years there's still a few of those people that are going on though the majority have drifted away so you go well that was a waste of time no hey one world one soul is worth a thousand worlds right so you know you do it for the Lord and the Lord brings the reward amen so it's not about numbers it's about being faithful and let God deal the rest I will give thee a crown of life since not even a cup of cold water is given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward how great shall the be the reward to him that gives his life as a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can't get a we can get a small idea if we compare it with a crown or with the crown won in a race 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul says know you not that they that run in the race run all but one receiveth the prize Soul run that ye may obtain so the crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of an olive branch but the crown spoken of here in the book in the revelation s is given to a martyr is a crown of royalty see Jesus calls it a crown of life so we're going for the Crown of Life not a crown a gold medal or anything but a crown of life now as we realize this then we also I want you to go to 1 Corinthians uh 9:25 and we'll just pick up just finish the thought here because there's a there's a thought that's going to go in with the next one the next thing I'm going to do so we'll pick it up in verse 25 now every man that receiveth a Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown we an Incorruptible I therefore run so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep my body and I bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away so we see here that we have to keep our body in subjection So it's talking then I should have F that off but that'll do so it's talking about our old nature and so God wants us to deal with our old nature in Romans 6 it says let not sin therefore re in your mortal bodies that you should obey the lust thereof so we're not to let sin reign in our mortal body you know some people say well I can't stop smoking well don't let it rain take it to the Lord in prayer until you get the victory over it right and then we go a little bit further and we see that the Bible says for we shall not live after the flesh ye shall die sorry if we live after the flesh we shall die but if we through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body we shall live so mortify means put to death so you know we have kids nowadays that are Gamers then we have people have road rage and they don't bring their body into subjection they just let it out and so as we we've been telling you here about the anger the Bible says be angry because it acknowledges you're going to get angry but don't sin get a resolve to the anger so we see then that the Bible shows us that we are to make ourselves subject mortify the Deeds of our body that we shall live now as I look at this thought we realize that the can you kick me back again do Escape because I clicked it and go back one just one uh no back to uh 14 I think it is there yeah there okay so that means mortify means to put to death so you and I have the ability to put to death that sin in our body that's sin that makes us that makes us fall away from the things of God then the next one that we want to look at is being a witness so in in uh Daniel it says here they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the frament permament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever so we have an an obligation to lead others to Christ now hey I hey this is hard this is hard work because nobody's really interested right you talk to unbelievers they're not interested you know when I do this anger resolution course in the prison they it's a volunteer thing so they come in and the first thing I do is give them an introduction of what I'm going to do and where I'm taking them and I bring in that it's going to be biblical oriented I said if you're you're not interested in there get up and leave and they do I've had them walk out and I only spending five minutes in there because they don't want anything to do with God but there have been others that'll stick for a while and we can start off with 12 guys but we're lucky we end up with six at the end of three months because it takes three months to go through the course so we see then that we realize that it's difficult to witness to somebody but you know what you're not going to Heaven until we find that last one right there's no way we're going to get out of here without saving somebody so why not let New Zealand be the one that brings the last one in huh and we can stand there in that day we got him you were looking for him but we got him we brought him in amen because we see then by bringing somebody to Christ it's like the stars of Heaven they shine in the crown of our Lord Jesus so there's nothing more wonderful than to lead somebody to the Lord right amen oh that's exciting am so the next one as we looked at is realizing the doctrine how much does the doctrine mean to us so in second Timothy 2 verse 4 it says I have fought a good fight this is Paul speaking I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing Lord Jesus come quickly right but like I said to you earlier on where would you you be without this messag what church would you go to how could you be spiritually fed it would be terrible to be in that position right now churches are not perfect by all means and I don't think Ben is nor is mine but they're better than the rest right so we need to see that God has given us a special blessing yeah to be able to share the word of God amen and when the person catches it like we had a prisoner here just recently it was with us for three or four months after he got out and he didn't like about brother Bram he didn't think we needed brother Bram but he goes to other churches then and he comes back he says you know what you're the only church that's got your kids under control he said the last church I was in it got so bad while the woman was talking up front she had to stop because the kid was running up and down the aisle screaming he said your kids are good I said there's a reason for that we were taught right amen cuz you'd be just like the rest of them if it wasn't for the teaching amen right that's a natural sort of thing you just follow the rest of the crowd so thank God for a message amen that opened our eyes to the understanding of what he wanted that's what he said would give us a reward amen praise the Lord for that huh okay let's go a little further and how much how much so how faithful are you to God's word see the biggest problem we have is reading our Bible and praying right we haven't got time too busy got to go go go go so you know we get to the point to where we read a verse real quick and carry on read a chapter real quick carry on hey I hey I'm preaching that myself okay now if you're involved in this you can say oh me right I say Amen because I'm involved in this as well because because we can get so familiar that we know where the scriptures are saying but we don't take the depth of it any longer so the Bible said if you continue in my words in John 8:31 if you continue in my words then are you my disciples and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and then it goes on in Philippians whereby my beloved as many as you have obeyed not as in my presence only but much more in my absence work out your salvation with fear and trembling so now it's our responsibility to read the word and get something from it you know so we study the word and we can do it as a family we have family or we can with single ones we can we can do it with single people together to where we study the word to get what is it saying to me I've got a talent I want to use it Lord help me to figure out what you want me to do with this talent I don't want it sitting there on the Shelf I want to be able to see something happening okay then the Bible tells us here but continue in the things which you thou has sought this is 2 Timothy 3:14 continue in the things which thou Hast learned and has been assured of knowing that whom thou Hast learned them so he's talking about himself that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise un salvation which is through faith which is in Christ Jesus for all scripture is given by inspiration of God profitable for Doctrine Repro correction instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished on every good works so God wants you to come to that place of knowing the word all right and using it in your life and so you got to ask questions sometimes what's it saying to me how does that work in my life you know meditation is a long thing that's been forgotten for a long time because meditation is you know the yoga meditation those guys do it but we're talking about meditation in the word yeah to where you take the word and you begin to say let me give you an example I always use this one Philippians 4: 19 anybody know what it is Christine there you go now did you catch that my God is he your God my God she'll do what Supply how much all right you you break it down so it becomes more personal to you as an individual and when the scripture becomes personal to you it ignites you it empowers you you know it will set you free because you will get the scripture that is able to make you wise amen oh I did it again back me up one please sorry about this so one back there you go okay and we don't look at things that we go on so much temporary now but we look to the end of the road where the rewards are given father we pray this morning that you will make our hearts solemn before thee as we listen pray that you will speak to us Lord through mortal lips may we hear you through mortal lips and then may we in return obey everything that you command us so are you listening amen amen okay I want you to give me a take-home thought at the end let's go a little further now what's a take-home thought what actually spoke to you yeah hey because I've been going for what over an hour now right is that right about an hour and I've said a lot of things and you might be got one thing and the next minute that thought drifted you and you just went bye-bye right so bring that thought back and what was it that really spoke to you okay be ready we're getting there one more so the Bible tells us here how we suffer for Christ so the Bible says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you you as though some s strange thing happened to you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you shall be glad also with exceeding Joy this is you know the Bible tells us that suffering is a part of Christian Living you're not going to get out of it I'm not going to get out of it it's going to happen some people it's going to be harder than others right some people are going to lose things some people are going to lose family are going to lose possessions but everybody suffers amen so it's a principle of God so don't think it's strange yeah that this has come upon you God has put it there for a reason it isn't it's for your good so you know there's another scripture in James that says count it all joy oh oh all joy how do you do that praise God my car just blew up Hallelujah Love You Lord well you know it's very hard to do that sincerely now you might say it but not really mean it right but you got to be able to say it and mean it thank God the kid just drove into a you know it's it's those things that are there are for us to suffer under and we're to count it all joy now uh the Bible tells us in Matthew 5 the beatitude says blessed are ye when men shall revile you persecute you say all manner of evil against you falsely rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted Thee the uh prophets which were before now let me just I just got one one or two more things to do here now watch what he says here this is a really good quote even though it's in the church age book and the church age book wasn't written by brother Brandon it was written by Brother Vil but he read it so cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval you got that yeah that's important yeah Cloudy Skies uh cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval neither are bright Skies and still water signs of his appro of his love and approval just because things are going good doesn't mean that he's approving it whoa okay his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved wow that's a resap approval is not and whether things are going well Jimmy keep those fingers how that saw you know and so his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how much so but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons of God and how shall I prove my love to him question mark by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trial that he in his wisdom allowed to come to pass wow Mark that down print it out put it on your refrigerator because there will be times of Cloudy Skies and there will be times of sunshine but his love is because you are the Beloved that's where it comes to pass amen and he's going to see you through no matter what where it goes okay last page Revelations 22 behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his Works shall be so what sort of a reward will you have have you laid up any treasure because he tells you to lay up treasure so I hope that I didn't confuse you but that you actually see now where the treasures are and what you can do to be a useful in the kingdom of God I can give brother Ben the test on the motivational gifts so you can see what your gifts are because you'll have one now I came across this stuff 30 years ago and when I took the test to tell me what my motivational gift was I was 20 points ahead of any other gift in ex exhortation 20 points the other ones were clustered here and when it came to Mercy that wasn't too good and and so over the 30 years that I've been going through this material and and sharing it with others to help them find their gift I've taken the test several times and each time my strength keeps coming back but my other ones keep going up thank God I'm maturing huh you know cuz that's what it should be to where you mature you know I'm not just a one-sided Christian I I've got a maturity here now and so the last time I took it I was only maybe five or 10 points ahead of the other gifts the other gifts were clustered even Mercy had come up a bit so we see then that those gifts are there for what for the edifying of the Saints yeah amen and it gives you an opportunity to see God work in your life but use it under the inspiration of God if you use it in a carnal way and you come in and you try to rearrange my house my wife won't let you do it I might but I she won't let's stand invite the musicians to come brother Ben you can fix up whatever I did [Laughter] wrong praise the Lord I know you all enjoy that imens this morning thank you so much praise God you got to send that test through now amen praise the Lord amen let's um when you were with me yeah yeah forgot what was I I don't know I was something
