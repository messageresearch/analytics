[28:50] i just feel led
[28:54] that there's a testimony
[28:57] just had that keep coming up on my mind
[28:59] so
[29:00] someone
[29:02] here's got something burning on their
[29:03] heart
[29:05] a testimony
[29:07] so i'm opening the floor
[29:11] don't be afraid
[29:12] if the lord's done something for you and
[29:14] you want to share it please
[29:35] sounds good
[29:52] morning signs
[29:54] i'll come forward so you don't have to
[29:55] go back
[29:56] thank you brother andy
[29:58] god bless you
[30:00] um
[30:04] it's actually sister londy's fault
[30:07] so
[30:09] about a year or two sister london you
[30:11] had that
[30:12] very horrible feeling come over you when
[30:14] you were sick
[30:16] you were really really sick
[30:18] and you
[30:19] still made it into church
[30:21] you really were sick we could see it
[30:23] there was no faking it
[30:25] and i remember sister londy coming into
[30:27] church and she was all red and her hands
[30:29] were oh you just were in a terrible
[30:31] state i can't even remember what was
[30:33] wrong
[30:33] but you knew she wasn't feeling very
[30:35] well
[30:36] and
[30:38] last night i was not feeling very well
[30:40] at all to be honest i was really sick i
[30:42] didn't feel good
[30:44] so this morning i woke up and the only
[30:46] thought that's in my head is
[30:47] she came
[30:49] she got blessed she received the healing
[30:52] and she moved on with god
[30:55] so um
[30:56] yeah i went back to sleep
[30:58] i was thinking so i said to shinto just
[31:00] give me five more minutes
[31:02] i just want to get everything together
[31:03] so i can get the courage to stand up
[31:05] because i felt really bad
[31:07] and we get dressed and you feel a little
[31:09] bit better and then satan comes and says
[31:12] no you're not
[31:13] and you go oh man
[31:15] and then everybody asks you are you
[31:16] feeling better and everything in your
[31:18] ghost oh
[31:19] and then
[31:20] god goes yes because it's his promise
[31:23] the only thought that carried me is if
[31:25] it worked for one christian
[31:27] only one if it worked for one it will
[31:29] work for me
[31:31] but sometimes we forget to look at him
[31:33] we always look at us
[31:35] so i feel much better praise the lord my
[31:38] headache is left hallelujah and we're
[31:40] going to praise the lord today so if you
[31:42] do feel sick or you feel tired don't
[31:44] look at you look at him
[31:47] but it takes one
[31:49] it takes one
[31:51] christian one experience with god that
[31:53] you see
[31:54] and that sits all in action so if you
[31:57] feel like contrary to what you have to
[31:59] be here today look at the one that
[32:00] doesn't feel that way look at the one
[32:02] that holds on to the promise
[32:04] and that's him you'll feel much better
[32:06] and you leave least
[32:07] but yeah if i go from scale one to ten i
[32:10] was about a three
[32:11] but i'm feeling about a ten right now so
[32:13] let's praise and worship the lord amen
[32:16] [Applause]
[32:26] as ottoman just said it only takes one
[32:28] and it just took him to remind me um
[32:31] last night i woke up in the middle of
[32:33] night feeling terrible as well and satan
[32:36] must have really been battling
[32:38] um
[32:38] and i was lying in bed feeling horrible
[32:42] um
[32:42] waking up heaps and i was just like man
[32:45] lord i just want to come to church
[32:46] tomorrow there's a youth service i just
[32:48] want to be here i don't want to stream
[32:50] and i woke up this morning feeling great
[32:53] so
[32:54] praise the lord that i can be here
[32:58] [Applause]

[45:13] numbers
[45:15] 33 50 says and the lord spake unto moses
[45:18] and the plains of moab by jordan near
[45:20] jericho saying
[45:21] speak unto the children of israel and
[45:23] say unto them
[45:24] when ye are passed over jordan into the
[45:27] land of canaan
[45:28] then ye shall drive out all the
[45:30] inhabitants of the land from before you
[45:33] and destroy their pictures and destroy
[45:35] the molten images and
[45:36] quite pluck down all the high places
[45:39] and you shall dispossess the inhabitants
[45:41] of the land and dwell therein for i have
[45:43] given you the land to possess it
[45:47] and you shall divide the land by lot for
[45:48] an inheritance among your families
[45:50] and to the more you shall give the more
[45:52] inheritance and to the fewer you shall
[45:54] give the less inheritance every man's
[45:56] inheritance shall be
[45:57] in the place where his lot falleth
[45:59] according to the tribes of your fathers
[46:01] you shall inherit
[46:02] but if you will not drive out the
[46:04] inhabitants of the land from before you
[46:07] then it shall come to pass that those
[46:09] which ye let remain of them shall be
[46:11] pricks in your eyes and thorns in your
[46:13] sides and shall vex you in the land
[46:15] wherein you dwell
[46:17] moreover it shall come to pass that i
[46:18] shall do unto you
[46:20] as i thought to do unto them
[46:22] may god bless you can have your seats
[46:24] this morning
[46:27] if you remember anything that i'm going
[46:28] to speak to you about this morning
[46:30] remember these words from jordan to the
[46:32] sea
[46:33] from jordan to the sea
[46:37] when you go away this week
[46:39] when you're in a trial when you're in
[46:40] anything think from jordan to the sea
[46:43] i didn't tell hannah this but she was um
[46:46] they were doing a quiet
[46:48] singing time after a service i think
[46:50] about two weeks ago and
[46:52] hannah started singing a song real slow
[46:54] we are able
[46:56] to go up and
[46:58] take the country and then unusually slow
[47:00] way but it was really nice and then she
[47:02] got to that line to possess the land
[47:05] from jordan to the sea
[47:08] and if you minister or just get thoughts
[47:10] from the lord you know we know sometimes
[47:12] a little word will come and you think
[47:14] from jordan to the sea
[47:16] i like that
[47:17] you know it sounds it sounds like it's a
[47:19] certain area and it sounds like a
[47:21] challenge
[47:22] from jordan to the sea we like to have
[47:24] goal posts and things we can look to and
[47:26] think i'll go and do that i'll do this
[47:28] so we like to have focus you know
[47:31] and when i heard of the words from
[47:33] jordan to the sea i thought that gives
[47:34] me some sort of focus there's something
[47:36] in there to
[47:37] try and capture so
[47:40] i'm going to go pretty fast this morning
[47:41] is that okay
[47:42] okay because once again i believe i'm
[47:44] looking at very intelligent people put
[47:46] your hand up if you're intelligent
[47:47] everyone put your hand up
[47:50] hey you're all fearfully and wonderfully
[47:52] made
[47:56] you're very intelligent the way your
[47:57] body works you realize there's millions
[47:59] of things happening in your body at the
[48:00] moment millions your body is just doing
[48:03] all sorts of stuff that we can't even
[48:05] comprehend you're very very intelligent
[48:08] you're the finest creation of god once
[48:10] he finished everything he made man and
[48:12] he said it's very good
[48:14] he's very proud of his creation don't
[48:15] ever downplay yourself you're very
[48:17] intelligent
[48:20] so intelligent that god came down and
[48:21] died for us
[48:22] so great i don't want to i know god's
[48:25] great but you know
[48:26] he thinks the same of us he thinks we're
[48:28] actually great and he wants to come
[48:29] fellowship with us
[48:31] i know we're believers and we're not
[48:32] it's not going to get to our head but we
[48:34] can appreciate it in the spirit that
[48:35] it's given when david said i'm fearfully
[48:36] and wonderfully made
[48:38] he wasn't bragging he was appreciating
[48:40] god i'm fearfully and wonderfully made
[48:41] because of what you've done amen
[48:44] okay
[48:46] so here we have this piece of land in
[48:48] the middle east
[48:50] you've got iraq and iran and maybe egypt
[48:54] modern times what they call them
[48:55] different names but we have this patch
[48:57] of land here and
[48:59] abram was in a place over near iraq he
[49:02] was
[49:03] over there and god visited abram one day
[49:05] and he said
[49:06] now the lord god now the lord had said
[49:08] unto abraham get the out of thy country
[49:10] and from thy kindred and from thy
[49:11] father's house unto a land that i will
[49:14] show thee
[49:16] so he gets some what you would call a
[49:18] promise
[49:20] god says abram
[49:21] leave here and you're going to bring
[49:22] over to another land so there's this
[49:24] idea from god
[49:25] and
[49:26] over time things happen and lots um a
[49:30] lot was with abram and then their
[49:32] herdsmen started to have strife
[49:34] and
[49:35] so they decided to part ways but after
[49:37] they did the lord said again to abraham
[49:41] and the lord said unto abram after that
[49:42] lot was separated from him lift up now
[49:45] thine eyes
[49:46] and look from the place where thou art
[49:49] look northward
[49:50] look south look east and look west look
[49:53] around you
[49:55] for the land which thou seest to thee
[49:57] will i give it thee and to thy seed
[49:59] forever
[50:01] to me that sounds like a promise look
[50:03] around you
[50:04] i'm going to give all this to you
[50:06] that's called a promise
[50:10] and
[50:10] to thee and i see forever
[50:13] we like to make promises and we think
[50:15] we're pretty good at keeping our world
[50:16] we say look i'll give you this i'll give
[50:17] you that i'll do this you know most of
[50:18] the time we try and do it sometimes we
[50:20] can't keep our promises because
[50:21] situations change we're like oh no i
[50:23] can't keep my promise you know we've got
[50:24] to walk back in our word and say look i
[50:26] know i said i was going to give you that
[50:27] i can't
[50:29] you know this has happened that's
[50:30] happened but god's promises aren't like
[50:32] that he's planned it all out and if he
[50:33] says he's going to give it to him
[50:34] forever that means
[50:37] if you look at it today they should
[50:38] still have it
[50:39] amen i believe they do
[50:42] because god is an eternal god he doesn't
[50:43] just
[50:44] he time doesn't go by and he realizes
[50:46] whoops that promise i told abraham a
[50:48] while ago i can't really keep that
[50:49] anymore because i didn't realize the
[50:50] enemy was going to be too strong and you
[50:51] guys were going to get taken out and
[50:52] then now i can't give it to you it's an
[50:55] eternal promise
[50:56] when god makes a promise it's forever
[50:59] the same as it is with us we have
[51:00] eternal promises that are in existence
[51:02] forever they don't go away there forever
[51:05] so that's why now you have this concept
[51:08] or this thought who's heard of the
[51:10] promised land
[51:12] and that's based on the fact that it was
[51:13] given by a promise
[51:16] not a promise from some man that said
[51:18] i'll give it to you i will
[51:19] bequeath this land to you like we have
[51:21] these little
[51:22] um
[51:23] reserves you know that a wealthy family
[51:25] says i'll give this reserve to the the
[51:28] people of this town you know and they
[51:29] they'll go to the council and say i'll
[51:31] give you this plot of land you can and
[51:32] then but name it after me make sure you
[51:34] name it after me so people know i gave
[51:35] it you know
[51:37] and you know and i'll give it to you and
[51:38] it's
[51:39] the people's forever well there's
[51:41] probably a lot of those reserves out of
[51:43] that not the people's anymore you know
[51:44] because new governments come and change
[51:46] things do this do that and they don't
[51:48] care about that that land that was
[51:50] bequeathed you know
[51:52] but not this land this is called the
[51:53] promised land because it's based on an
[51:55] eternal promise from god
[51:57] and it just happened to be
[51:59] that little area there there was a lot
[52:01] of other land around this wasn't the
[52:03] only plot of land in the world
[52:04] it was just that area of land there that
[52:06] was where the promise was
[52:08] amen it wasn't
[52:10] over near iraq although there was
[52:11] nothing wrong with iraq
[52:12] or it wasn't further north maybe
[52:15] up around greece or somewhere or rome or
[52:17] you could go south maybe down into
[52:19] africa there's nothing wrong there's
[52:20] places
[52:21] it just wasn't there god just decided
[52:24] here
[52:25] that was it
[52:26] god just decides things and that's just
[52:27] the way that it is it's there
[52:29] you can't
[52:30] abraham couldn't walk around and say oh
[52:32] god's promised me some land i think i'll
[52:33] go and grab this land over here in iraq
[52:35] it wouldn't be the same
[52:37] thank you
[52:38] so this is the promised land
[52:41] now
[52:41] as i go through this i want to there's a
[52:43] purpose for this i'm talking i'm going
[52:44] to mainly talk about a spiritual
[52:46] promised land from jordan to the sea but
[52:49] we have to go with a spiritual from a
[52:51] natural promised land then a spiritual
[52:53] promise then i love the word of god
[52:54] because it all makes sense and
[52:56] everything has to make i like things
[52:58] making sense in my mind not because i
[52:59] want to actually understand it although
[53:01] i think god as a such a powerful god
[53:04] that everything he does is awesome it's
[53:06] like when you take apart something you
[53:07] look at it and you think well this is
[53:08] made really well they thought about this
[53:10] and they put that there because of this
[53:11] and this
[53:12] god's no different when you start to
[53:14] unpack it you realize well this is made
[53:16] very well he did this because of this
[53:17] and this and this
[53:18] he's an intelligent god
[53:21] okay so now we're going to talk about a
[53:22] spiritual promise then real quick
[53:25] and it shall come to pass that i will
[53:27] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[53:29] your sons and your daughters shall
[53:30] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[53:33] and your young men shall see visions so
[53:35] now this is another promise
[53:38] he's trying to talk about a promise the
[53:39] same as he said to abram i'll give you
[53:41] this land go here and i'll give you this
[53:42] it's this is now a promise
[53:45] and behold i send the promise of my
[53:48] father upon you
[53:49] an eternal promise
[53:51] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[53:53] until you be endured with power
[53:55] from on high amen
[53:58] so now
[53:59] after that
[54:00] the disciples were in the upper room and
[54:02] the power of god came down and filled
[54:04] them all with the holy ghost with the
[54:05] spirit of god filled them into
[54:07] overflowing and they staggered around
[54:08] like drunk men and drunk women and it
[54:11] was about nine o'clock in the morning
[54:12] the third hour of the day
[54:14] and people started saying look at these
[54:15] guys they've just been in the upper room
[54:17] getting drunk because they're staggering
[54:18] on the streets that's what they said
[54:19] these men are all drunk
[54:21] you're an embarrassment to society look
[54:23] at you you know you should be at work
[54:24] you should be doing whatever it was but
[54:26] but they were drunk with the new wine
[54:29] with the promise
[54:30] that entered into that promised land
[54:32] amen
[54:34] and that's when peter said but this is
[54:35] that which was spoken by the prophet
[54:37] joel and it shall come to pass in the
[54:39] last days saith god that i'll pour out
[54:41] my spirit upon all flesh
[54:43] he's saying i'm in the land
[54:45] i'm not drunk i'm just in the promised
[54:47] land
[54:48] okay
[54:51] then they said he preached to them the
[54:53] gospel and they said to him
[54:56] they were pricked in their heart and the
[54:57] people around said what should we do to
[54:59] be saved well how can we get into this
[55:00] promised land and peter said unto them
[55:02] repent and be baptized every one of you
[55:04] in the name of jesus christ for the
[55:05] remission of your sins and you shall
[55:07] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[55:09] you too can receive this promise for the
[55:11] promise is unto you and to your children
[55:14] and to all that are afar off
[55:16] even as many as the lord our god shall
[55:17] call so he left this promise wide open
[55:19] for a lot of people i'm glad he didn't
[55:21] say for the promises to us and just a
[55:23] few of you people here and then that's
[55:24] it we wouldn't be here today we wouldn't
[55:26] bother preaching this gospel if he said
[55:28] that
[55:29] but he said it's to you to your children
[55:31] to them that are far off last time i
[55:33] checked we were quite a ways from
[55:34] jerusalem here
[55:36] i believe some people call this the
[55:37] outermost parts of the earth
[55:39] invercargill is the outermost part of
[55:41] the earth
[55:42] that's why no one goes there
[55:44] [Laughter]
[55:47] now
[55:49] this is talking about the promise to
[55:50] whom god would make known
[55:53] are
[55:54] what is the riches of the glory of this
[55:56] mystery among the gentiles which is
[55:57] christ and you the hope of glory
[56:00] because now we saw from the last
[56:01] scripture that the promise was the holy
[56:03] ghost that that was what the promise was
[56:05] that you've got this piece of promised
[56:07] land
[56:08] now the spiritual type of that is the
[56:09] holy ghost receiving the holy ghost
[56:12] that's what
[56:13] we all understand that that's what the
[56:15] promise is
[56:16] is to receive the holy ghost
[56:18] now
[56:19] i said that's why i asked the question
[56:21] what is the holy ghost and paul expounds
[56:23] it he says to whom god will make known
[56:25] what is the riches of the glory of this
[56:27] mystery among the gentiles which is
[56:29] christ in you the hope of glory so
[56:32] that's a manifestation of the promise is
[56:34] when christ comes into you
[56:37] well the next one says
[56:39] and that at that day you shall know that
[56:41] i am in my father
[56:43] and ye and me and i in you
[56:47] now we know it's physically i don't
[56:49] disbelieve god but i will tell you it's
[56:51] probably physically impossible for for
[56:53] one human being to go inside another
[56:54] human being
[56:56] naturally speaking right like i couldn't
[56:59] jump into mikey you know
[57:01] it doesn't
[57:03] but yet this human being said i will be
[57:05] with you even in you
[57:07] you and me and i and you so so then what
[57:10] is that
[57:11] what is this thing that comes in us this
[57:13] this being that speaking his name was
[57:15] jesus
[57:17] so jesus
[57:19] is god
[57:21] and when he says i will be with you even
[57:22] in you then it's jesus that comes into
[57:24] us
[57:25] from that he's eternal from the way
[57:28] before time to now it's it's
[57:30] it's it's always says christ in you well
[57:32] the physical man jesus body doesn't come
[57:34] and dwell on us but he says i'll be with
[57:36] you even in you right so the holy ghost
[57:38] is jesus christ coming in us that's why
[57:40] we're baptized in his name repent me
[57:42] baptize the name of jesus christ
[57:44] okay now just i just because i wanted to
[57:46] explain this just so we know this is
[57:47] what this is what this is all about it's
[57:49] not some
[57:50] it's it's everything that god is comes
[57:53] into us right
[57:55] and god
[57:56] in order to for us to try and understand
[57:58] this god explains himself as being a
[58:01] water or as being
[58:03] the word
[58:04] and and
[58:05] just like god's intelligent design these
[58:08] i don't think he didn't make these
[58:10] things and then think oh wow i didn't
[58:11] realize that was like a spiritual thing
[58:13] i'll tell them
[58:14] i'll explain myself that just happened
[58:16] to match the spiritual thing he made a
[58:18] spiritual thing and then he made a
[58:19] natural thing
[58:21] to mirror the spiritual things so you
[58:22] could say this is what that's like so he
[58:24] he describes himself as water and i said
[58:26] this if you have a lake called jesus
[58:28] water has the capacity that you could
[58:30] take some out of the lake and i could
[58:32] drink it
[58:33] and i've got the same lake in me and yet
[58:35] the lake still exists there but i've got
[58:36] some in me and it's the same lake
[58:38] now if i put that back in the lake it's
[58:40] just gonna you couldn't tell where it
[58:42] was because it's all the same thing it
[58:44] just dissipates back in the lake
[58:46] so
[58:46] so this is when jesus says i'll be with
[58:48] you even in you it's just we we draw
[58:50] from that great fountain of god and it
[58:52] comes every single
[58:54] it's not the whole of god
[58:55] fits in us because god fills all time
[58:58] and space but it's some of it comes out
[59:00] and gets put into us
[59:01] okay that's
[59:03] that's what that is
[59:05] and that's called the earnest of our
[59:06] inheritance that's called the
[59:08] the down payment we get this little down
[59:09] payment and one day we're going to have
[59:11] the fullness of god everywhere around us
[59:13] and in glory but we get this all the
[59:16] same goes with the thought so if i think
[59:18] something like if jesus thinks my name
[59:19] is jesus
[59:21] that exists in his mind but when he's
[59:23] but if he speaks it out it becomes a
[59:25] word that is in existence
[59:27] and yet it couldn't be an ex
[59:30] it's not different than the thought that
[59:31] was in his mind
[59:32] even though it's now separate that's why
[59:34] christ when christ came out of god it's
[59:36] no different than god it was just an
[59:37] expression
[59:39] he understands it's no different
[59:42] you can't the two are all the thought
[59:44] and the word are the same thing just
[59:46] just at one point it was in his mind at
[59:47] another point it was spoken
[59:49] but you can't have one without the other
[59:51] see so so god's made these types to show
[59:54] so when christ said i will be with you
[59:55] it's that's god saying i will be with
[59:57] you
[59:58] that's almighty god so that's what we
[1:00:00] get right that's uh
[1:00:03] okay so now we have this thing called
[1:00:05] the promised land
[1:00:06] now
[1:00:07] you've got this other
[1:00:09] idea this other issue i suppose you
[1:00:11] would say that
[1:00:12] there was also similar land to the
[1:00:14] promised land around the promised land
[1:00:17] like
[1:00:19] like if i had the border if i was if my
[1:00:22] if the water was here
[1:00:23] who's done this like you you go to
[1:00:25] canada say all the states you know and
[1:00:27] you you're in canada you say well i'm in
[1:00:29] canada
[1:00:30] no i'm in america
[1:00:32] now i'm in canada
[1:00:34] pretty well you're the land is going to
[1:00:36] be very very similar whether you go i'm
[1:00:38] in canada if there's snow there you
[1:00:39] pretty much step in the states and
[1:00:41] you're going to be in snow it's very
[1:00:42] very similar
[1:00:44] okay or if you're in mexico in tucson
[1:00:46] you know
[1:00:47] mexico tucson it's both going to be dry
[1:00:49] desert maybe there's a cactus growing
[1:00:51] right on the border you know where you
[1:00:53] are you american or are you mexican
[1:00:57] i'm mexican
[1:01:01] so
[1:01:03] this is why you get this issue here
[1:01:06] for there shall arise false christ and
[1:01:08] false prophecy and shall show great
[1:01:09] signs and wonders and so much that it
[1:01:10] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:01:12] very elect there are there are similar
[1:01:14] land that sort of looks very similar but
[1:01:16] it's not the same it's not the promised
[1:01:18] land
[1:01:18] okay i just put this photo in because
[1:01:20] that looks kind of scary hey
[1:01:23] this is where this this is the uh
[1:01:27] uh yeah it's it's the it's where they
[1:01:28] give it addresses at the vatican you
[1:01:30] know what would you design it like to
[1:01:32] look like a snake that's just weird
[1:01:35] like this is the place where you talk
[1:01:36] about the king that
[1:01:37] supposedly that
[1:01:39] god why would you
[1:01:40] i don't think that was a coincidence
[1:01:41] that it looks like a snake and it
[1:01:43] reverses back the other way so when the
[1:01:45] pope's talking it looks like all the
[1:01:47] people being eaten by a snake
[1:01:50] this is not from god i'm pretty sure
[1:01:52] that if a holy ghost filled architect
[1:01:55] would design a building he'd probably
[1:01:56] and he wanted to make it look like an
[1:01:57] animal he'd make it look like a lamb or
[1:01:59] something or a lion you know
[1:02:02] but this is not from god right this is
[1:02:04] this is not part of the promised land
[1:02:05] this there are
[1:02:07] there are people that are
[1:02:08] plowing and doing things and that are
[1:02:11] not the land maybe look this doesn't
[1:02:13] look that similar but there is none that
[1:02:14] looks quite similar
[1:02:15] we've got a little test for you children
[1:02:19] are these lands the same
[1:02:21] no
[1:02:22] one's like
[1:02:24] you know something's easy to discern
[1:02:26] it's not hard to discern things like if
[1:02:28] you look at this thing you think wow
[1:02:29] that's a nice green field that's israel
[1:02:30] by the way
[1:02:31] and you think if someone showed you that
[1:02:33] as being the promised land the
[1:02:36] antarctica you'd say no that doesn't
[1:02:38] look the same it's different you know
[1:02:40] or here's another one quite that similar
[1:02:43] guys children
[1:02:44] no quite the opposite that is this not
[1:02:46] going to fool you it looks you know
[1:02:48] one's desert ones
[1:02:51] you know what about this one these look
[1:02:53] the same
[1:02:54] oh come on man they look the same
[1:02:56] they must look exactly the same
[1:02:58] it's not as raw that that that
[1:03:01] that one there is zealand
[1:03:03] in the netherlands sea land
[1:03:05] and then people must come here and
[1:03:06] they're like wow that looks just like
[1:03:08] zealand so they call this place new
[1:03:09] zealand
[1:03:10] [Laughter]
[1:03:14] or like
[1:03:15] people from the uk must have gone to
[1:03:17] taranaki oh this looks like plymouth
[1:03:18] we'll call this new plymouth
[1:03:20] you know you're down south they all this
[1:03:22] looks like brighton we'll call this new
[1:03:23] brighton
[1:03:24] well york this is new york you know
[1:03:27] the state is full of new caledonia new
[1:03:29] hampshire
[1:03:30] all this
[1:03:32] okay
[1:03:33] this one here it's the same uh zeeland
[1:03:36] new zealand you can see why these
[1:03:37] thought to look quite similar right
[1:03:40] so
[1:03:41] this is not part of my overall sermon i
[1:03:43] just wanted to touch on this because
[1:03:45] because it is true that within this area
[1:03:48] you can have
[1:03:49] you've got
[1:03:50] you can have a lot right near the border
[1:03:52] that's where you get all the trouble
[1:03:53] because it's very similar
[1:03:55] okay a long way away you're not going to
[1:03:57] fall for it like some
[1:03:59] thing that looks like darkness you're
[1:04:00] not going to fall for that because it's
[1:04:01] hey that's ice this is sick
[1:04:03] this is green pasture that's desert this
[1:04:06] is green these don't look the same i'm
[1:04:08] aware of that but when it gets quite
[1:04:10] close it's more tricky to discern which
[1:04:12] one is which you know which one's the
[1:04:13] land which one is new zealand
[1:04:15] it's hard to tell
[1:04:17] the way that i tell
[1:04:18] now
[1:04:19] i just want to say this
[1:04:22] you can't
[1:04:23] i'm not saying this to be controversial
[1:04:24] but you can't say oh it's just by the
[1:04:26] word
[1:04:27] because everyone has the same word
[1:04:29] essentially it's
[1:04:31] i like to call it the
[1:04:33] the revealed word
[1:04:34] so it's got to do three things it's got
[1:04:36] to line up with
[1:04:37] my my understanding of a word has to
[1:04:40] line up with all the rest of the word
[1:04:42] because if it's the same spirit the same
[1:04:43] water
[1:04:45] in people and inspiring people the word
[1:04:47] is going to match all the way through if
[1:04:48] it's the same so the first thing is the
[1:04:50] word has to
[1:04:51] the revealed word is where someone comes
[1:04:53] with the revealed word of god and speaks
[1:04:55] it and it matches with everything else
[1:04:56] and then when the next person comes
[1:04:58] along could be ten years later could be
[1:05:00] a hundred years that it could be a
[1:05:01] thousand years later it's the same like
[1:05:03] it's the same word the same spirit
[1:05:06] they speak it and it matches with
[1:05:07] everything else so that's the first one
[1:05:10] and in our time the revealed word for
[1:05:12] our time
[1:05:13] says the same thing
[1:05:16] and then if you've got the spirit in you
[1:05:18] then your heart will witness the same
[1:05:20] thing as well
[1:05:21] okay so it's all that's that's what i'm
[1:05:24] going to say is the land not
[1:05:27] because i'm probably going jumping ahead
[1:05:28] a bit but
[1:05:29] but
[1:05:30] paul had to read the same word as the
[1:05:32] pharisees did he didn't have any more
[1:05:34] scriptures than they had and yet his
[1:05:36] gospel was very different
[1:05:37] he read the same scriptures
[1:05:39] see they and it's the same today we all
[1:05:41] read the same word of god and yet it's
[1:05:44] the interpretation is very different
[1:05:46] because some is not the correct
[1:05:47] interpretation
[1:05:49] so you can't just say it's the word it's
[1:05:51] the interpretation of the word
[1:05:53] and that's the you got that's why you've
[1:05:54] got to find your revealed word for your
[1:05:55] day and you'll find it will match up
[1:05:56] with everything else
[1:05:58] that's why brother brown said well paul
[1:05:59] be judged they said yes paul will be
[1:06:01] judged he said well i'm safe then i
[1:06:02] preach the same gospel that he preached
[1:06:04] because the revealed word will always be
[1:06:06] the same
[1:06:07] okay but
[1:06:08] moving on from that
[1:06:10] this now was called in here an
[1:06:12] inheritance islam was called an
[1:06:14] inheritance
[1:06:16] okay because god gave it to
[1:06:18] potentially gave it to abraham as a
[1:06:20] promise therefore
[1:06:21] it becomes an inheritance this is my
[1:06:23] inheritance and all of his children it's
[1:06:24] now their
[1:06:25] inheritance so
[1:06:27] i like to call it family land this is
[1:06:29] family land
[1:06:31] the scripture says in whom also we have
[1:06:33] obtained an inheritance
[1:06:35] being predestinated according to the
[1:06:37] purpose of him that worketh all things
[1:06:38] after the council of his own will
[1:06:41] so now
[1:06:42] because we are
[1:06:44] the promised land as an inheritance for
[1:06:47] the children of god
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:51] so therefore it's family land for us
[1:06:53] it's it's something
[1:06:55] it's not just it's if i could explain it
[1:06:58] in the right way when you look at it
[1:07:01] closely it's not just for everyone
[1:07:04] this is an inheritance for the children
[1:07:06] of god
[1:07:07] which god chose before the foundation of
[1:07:09] the world this is your inheritance
[1:07:11] so the holy ghost is
[1:07:13] an inheritance for the children of god
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:16] all that the father has given me will
[1:07:17] come
[1:07:20] that's who it's for
[1:07:21] it's family land there's something about
[1:07:23] that land that connects with you because
[1:07:24] it's part of you it's my family land
[1:07:27] okay this is why this says according as
[1:07:29] he has chosen us in him before the
[1:07:31] foundation of the world he's chosen us
[1:07:33] to have this promise
[1:07:35] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:07:37] before him in love
[1:07:40] in whom ye also trusted after that you
[1:07:42] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[1:07:43] your
[1:07:44] salvation
[1:07:46] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:07:48] promise
[1:07:50] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:07:53] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:07:54] possession
[1:07:55] to the praise of his glory so it's a
[1:07:57] small portion of what we're going to get
[1:07:59] like
[1:08:00] and even in the natural you know the
[1:08:02] spiritual israel is going to own the
[1:08:03] whole world eventually
[1:08:05] they're going to be there with us the
[1:08:07] the gods chosen people of israel will be
[1:08:09] there when the earth is renovated owning
[1:08:11] the whole thing so this here is just a
[1:08:13] small portion god says well you're here
[1:08:15] and well it's like this you'll just have
[1:08:17] that little portion
[1:08:18] it's but eventually those that are that
[1:08:20] are actually the spiritual israel will
[1:08:22] end up with the whole world as ownership
[1:08:24] it's the same with us we for a small
[1:08:26] time just have this portion of the
[1:08:28] spirit of god as a promise but he's
[1:08:30] saying this is just until you end up
[1:08:31] with everything with the fullness of god
[1:08:34] everything
[1:08:35] it's just until then this is just a uh
[1:08:38] uh
[1:08:39] doubt like uh
[1:08:43] he was gonna say yeah
[1:08:45] you sort of own the whole thing but it's
[1:08:46] proof you own it you know it's like the
[1:08:47] key for something the key man i'm gonna
[1:08:49] go get my car but i've got the key yeah
[1:08:51] that's the down payment
[1:08:52] okay
[1:08:54] but this is family land
[1:08:55] right there's something that connects
[1:08:57] you with this promise
[1:08:58] more than what will connect someone
[1:09:00] that's not part of the family with the
[1:09:02] promise
[1:09:02] that's why you have all the issue in the
[1:09:04] similar land because there's a lot of
[1:09:05] people there doing a lot of stuff there
[1:09:07] they're not they're
[1:09:08] they are not promised that land that's
[1:09:10] not their inheritance
[1:09:12] that's why they can labor on just on the
[1:09:13] other side of the border there doing
[1:09:15] their thing looks very similar but it's
[1:09:16] not for them
[1:09:18] that's people this side is
[1:09:20] there is
[1:09:21] ours that's not and that's theirs and
[1:09:23] this is not
[1:09:25] that's how it works
[1:09:27] so now
[1:09:28] we then make this journey
[1:09:30] you know we
[1:09:32] we at some point in our natural walk
[1:09:36] we we
[1:09:38] something in us says we hear about this
[1:09:40] promise and something in us desires for
[1:09:42] that
[1:09:43] we might live some of us may our life
[1:09:45] may have been over here in the cold
[1:09:46] desert we might be just be living a full
[1:09:48] life of sin just
[1:09:50] you know after all sorts of no good
[1:09:51] there'll be people here that were like
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:54] some people in the middle here were not
[1:09:55] so bad kind of
[1:09:57] our life was kind of similar to what the
[1:09:59] lamb was like but not you know still was
[1:10:00] a little bit different some people maybe
[1:10:03] are brought up in the message and you
[1:10:04] know you kind of you understand already
[1:10:06] how it
[1:10:07] the whole thing how it works you're very
[1:10:09] familiar with the land but you have to
[1:10:11] have your own experience to get in
[1:10:13] and your own promise but you're very
[1:10:14] familiar with how it all works
[1:10:16] you know that's this is just how
[1:10:19] this is just what happens right there
[1:10:21] are people sitting in here that come
[1:10:22] from all different areas
[1:10:24] but you're all
[1:10:26] if you're if that's your inheritance
[1:10:28] then you're all making that journey and
[1:10:29] i put sometimes only one person comes in
[1:10:31] sometimes the family might the god will
[1:10:33] call a whole family in sometimes it
[1:10:35] might be a couple just god does it but
[1:10:36] he's he's calling people he's calling
[1:10:38] his not people
[1:10:40] he's calling his children to their
[1:10:41] inheritance
[1:10:43] from all aspects from all walks of life
[1:10:45] and they
[1:10:46] they're all making this journey
[1:10:49] so they they they all make their way
[1:10:51] there now
[1:10:53] you then they they get to the
[1:10:55] they get to this
[1:10:58] the i'm going to call this the border of
[1:10:59] the promised land and it's and this is
[1:11:01] where we hit the scripture at the start
[1:11:02] and the lord spoke unto moses on the
[1:11:03] plains of moab by jordan near jericho
[1:11:06] saying speak unto the children of israel
[1:11:08] and santa then when ye are passed over
[1:11:10] jordan into the land of canaan
[1:11:13] i'm not going to get technical but they
[1:11:15] actually had more land promise than
[1:11:16] which was the other side of jordan and a
[1:11:17] lot of other stuff okay so
[1:11:19] the land they've got now is not actually
[1:11:21] all that they were promised they will
[1:11:22] promise a lot more
[1:11:24] but for the purposes of this just to
[1:11:26] make it easier because we can look at
[1:11:27] the map and look where it is we're just
[1:11:28] going to say that this is it here
[1:11:30] but there is actually more maybe there's
[1:11:32] a type in that you know they didn't
[1:11:34] quite get everything
[1:11:36] okay
[1:11:37] but here it says they they were sitting
[1:11:40] they'd gone up and they were on the
[1:11:41] jordan and god says when you cross over
[1:11:45] then
[1:11:46] this is what's going to happen
[1:11:47] so they were about over here where i put
[1:11:49] the flag
[1:11:50] it's about where they were they're on
[1:11:52] the plains and jordan seemed to be about
[1:11:54] a marker you know like a a border
[1:11:57] so it was something significant when you
[1:11:58] cross over it all starts you're going to
[1:12:00] push on
[1:12:02] you know
[1:12:04] and that's why this song here comes and
[1:12:06] we were able to go up and take the
[1:12:07] country that's standing on the on the
[1:12:08] border to possess the land from jordan
[1:12:11] to the sea
[1:12:12] because remember that was their promise
[1:12:15] uh abraham you're going to have from
[1:12:16] here to here and it was from jordan to
[1:12:18] the sea
[1:12:19] and
[1:12:21] about and down here and up to there this
[1:12:23] is what you're going to have
[1:12:24] so they they were they arrived on this
[1:12:26] spot with a promise this whole land is
[1:12:28] ours
[1:12:29] and all the children of israel there and
[1:12:31] we get there too we get to this on the
[1:12:33] border and we say this whole we have
[1:12:35] this promise this whole land is mine
[1:12:37] okay though the giants may be their way
[1:12:39] to hinder god will surely give the
[1:12:40] victory amen okay
[1:12:43] so then they had to cross over jordan
[1:12:46] now that's why
[1:12:47] god said when you get there they were
[1:12:49] under strict commandment
[1:12:51] strict commandment when you get there
[1:12:52] start taking it
[1:12:54] take it don't sit back
[1:12:57] don't think oh they look big
[1:13:00] start
[1:13:01] figure out what's yours which was
[1:13:03] actually the whole land and start taking
[1:13:04] it so when you walk in
[1:13:07] if you ever unsure he would say if
[1:13:09] you're ever unsure whether you should
[1:13:10] take it or not just look on the map look
[1:13:12] where jordan is
[1:13:14] look where the sea is and look where you
[1:13:15] are if you're in the middle of that take
[1:13:17] it
[1:13:18] i'm not sure if i should there's a big
[1:13:20] giant here a big city i'm not sure we
[1:13:21] can take it you send the message back to
[1:13:23] home base they will say um can you tell
[1:13:25] me your coordinates
[1:13:27] they send back they say uh our
[1:13:29] coordinates are we uh crossed over
[1:13:31] jordan and then we okay yep and then
[1:13:34] what direction did you walk ah we walked
[1:13:40] west we walked about 200 kilometers west
[1:13:43] okay so you're
[1:13:45] you hit the c yet no one i haven't at
[1:13:46] the c yet take it
[1:13:49] my calculations are between jordan and
[1:13:51] the sea take it
[1:13:52] it's yours
[1:13:54] someone said oh where are you oh we
[1:13:56] started at jordan and we headed uh
[1:13:58] east about 200k should we take this
[1:14:00] you're aware
[1:14:03] hang on no no
[1:14:05] no that's not between jordan and the sea
[1:14:06] you've gone the wrong way it's not the
[1:14:08] promise out there don't go messing with
[1:14:09] that like we read this morning you know
[1:14:11] when and the word for the day i said
[1:14:13] they went out and brother brown said you
[1:14:15] know they went somewhere where they
[1:14:16] shouldn't of and then god chastise them
[1:14:18] because hey you're going the wrong way
[1:14:19] amen it's not not where you're supposed
[1:14:21] to be it's not your promise there
[1:14:23] but it's between jordan and the sea so
[1:14:25] any if you ever can if you ever wonder
[1:14:27] the word of god the promises for us are
[1:14:29] between jordan and the sea so anything
[1:14:31] in there take it
[1:14:32] and it was a strict commandment god said
[1:14:34] take it all
[1:14:36] and he said if you don't if you don't
[1:14:37] take it all it's going to get
[1:14:40] the things you leave will be trouble to
[1:14:42] you you'll be a thorn in your side
[1:14:44] they'll give you trouble the whole time
[1:14:46] and what's more if you don't take that
[1:14:48] then i'll do to you what i was going to
[1:14:50] do to them
[1:14:51] this is not optional i'm not sure
[1:14:54] thinking about it
[1:14:55] this was actually a commandment you will
[1:14:57] take this whole land
[1:15:00] you will take it
[1:15:02] and the commandment was
[1:15:04] from jordan to the sea
[1:15:06] that's why i say if you you must
[1:15:08] remember this if you forget everything
[1:15:09] just remember this from jordan to the
[1:15:11] sea if you ever feel like you're a bit
[1:15:13] weary just think hang on hang on no i'm
[1:15:15] going to take from jordan to the sea the
[1:15:16] whole lot everything
[1:15:18] okay
[1:15:20] so now we're going to do a little bit of
[1:15:21] thinking
[1:15:23] this is kind of how it works in a
[1:15:24] spiritual sense and this is a natural
[1:15:26] sense
[1:15:27] that each area of lamb represents a part
[1:15:29] of the word of god and we're going to
[1:15:30] call that the revealed word of god like
[1:15:31] the promises the things that god has
[1:15:33] that's what
[1:15:35] there's a lot of different land here you
[1:15:36] know some is hilly
[1:15:38] some are plain some are rivers there's
[1:15:40] al there are all sorts of different
[1:15:41] lands to be taken some there are some
[1:15:43] big fortresses up on hills
[1:15:45] some are on the valleys some are easy to
[1:15:47] get some are a lot harder
[1:15:49] the the the land is all
[1:15:52] the word of god represents these
[1:15:55] all sorts of different areas of land
[1:15:56] that's this is this is the way this one
[1:15:58] works now
[1:15:59] it just so happens
[1:16:02] that as in the natural so the spiritual
[1:16:04] that every every promise of god that
[1:16:07] lays in that land there will be
[1:16:09] opposition to you getting that
[1:16:12] okay that this is the way because when
[1:16:14] the children of israel turned up the
[1:16:15] land wasn't
[1:16:17] empty ready to go
[1:16:19] it was there were a lot of people there
[1:16:22] and there were a lot of people that
[1:16:23] didn't agree with what with them taking
[1:16:25] it
[1:16:26] we're talking generations of family
[1:16:28] farms man and you mean i'm gonna walk
[1:16:30] away from it just because you said it
[1:16:31] was yours according to a promise no way
[1:16:34] man we're staying and we're fighting you
[1:16:36] know get all the get the most bravest
[1:16:39] men out we're gonna fight back at these
[1:16:40] people that are gonna come in and try
[1:16:41] and take our land
[1:16:43] and we're gonna
[1:16:44] they're out to absolutely destroy us so
[1:16:47] we're going to give it everything we got
[1:16:50] one or the other are going to win
[1:16:52] and when you're in a fight
[1:16:55] if people have the same desire if it's
[1:16:57] life or death i can pretty much assure
[1:16:59] you if there's a fight between life and
[1:17:00] death you're gonna fight for your life
[1:17:03] as the saying goes
[1:17:05] so none of the
[1:17:07] with every promise in the word of god
[1:17:10] when you cross over the land you receive
[1:17:11] the holy ghost you receive the spirit of
[1:17:13] god you're in the
[1:17:14] land nothing is going to come easy for
[1:17:17] you
[1:17:18] every single word of god is going to
[1:17:19] have opposition is going to oppose you
[1:17:22] okay that's this this is the way this
[1:17:23] thing works
[1:17:25] uh
[1:17:26] it's going to say all sorts of stuff now
[1:17:28] in the natural you could see an enemy or
[1:17:29] this that guy is he one of us no it's
[1:17:31] not one of us okay is he between jordan
[1:17:33] and the c yes well then he's gone you
[1:17:35] know it was pretty straightforward stuff
[1:17:37] is that johnny no that's not johnny okay
[1:17:39] take him out
[1:17:40] you know
[1:17:41] this here is but
[1:17:43] but now we have we are in a natural a
[1:17:45] spiritual sense now so this is now the
[1:17:47] battle is in our mind
[1:17:49] okay so
[1:17:50] and we we will get things like you know
[1:17:52] i'm here and this is all quite normal
[1:17:53] you know there's this i'm too entrenched
[1:17:55] to be able to get if you've gotten rid
[1:17:57] of you cannot defeat me this this is
[1:17:59] what they said in the natural but also
[1:18:00] the spiritual
[1:18:01] that's it's thoughts it's
[1:18:03] yeah okay
[1:18:05] now this is what i i want you to
[1:18:06] understand there's some parts we benefit
[1:18:08] from possessing and some we don't
[1:18:11] okay
[1:18:12] some
[1:18:13] some things make you feel good you know
[1:18:15] you there
[1:18:16] okay this okay i've just this is
[1:18:18] important to look at like this because
[1:18:19] we have to
[1:18:20] when we're a believer we're taking the
[1:18:22] whole lot
[1:18:23] see but
[1:18:25] green we benefit some things in the word
[1:18:27] of god we benefit i want my healing
[1:18:29] that's a part of the promised land oh
[1:18:30] yes
[1:18:31] why is it so good to you because if you
[1:18:33] can't walk very well and then one day
[1:18:34] you can you it benefits you well i can
[1:18:36] walk this
[1:18:38] i'm a recipient of a good thing here
[1:18:40] right yeah amen
[1:18:41] uh great you don't let's say you have to
[1:18:43] stop doing something that maybe you've
[1:18:44] done for a long time that god says you
[1:18:46] got to stop that i've done this for a
[1:18:47] long time this is just me and you know
[1:18:49] and you can't see how it benefits you at
[1:18:51] all because you just got to stop doing
[1:18:52] something
[1:18:53] but if that's part of the word of god
[1:18:55] let's be honest some things don't
[1:18:57] benefit you you just got to stop that
[1:19:00] okay so i'll stop it then what i'm not
[1:19:02] saying you argue with god but i'm saying
[1:19:04] blue either or some things are like
[1:19:07] some people struggle some people don't
[1:19:08] they're like either or brown
[1:19:11] don't know
[1:19:13] so green right
[1:19:15] when jesus fed the five thousand you
[1:19:16] know that provision is part of the word
[1:19:18] of god god's our provider these guys
[1:19:21] were happy so happy wow look we got all
[1:19:23] this bread and we're happy we've got a
[1:19:24] full stomach you know this is easy this
[1:19:26] will take this land you know
[1:19:27] because that you benefit
[1:19:29] uh when you get like healing
[1:19:32] you know these are these are easier
[1:19:33] these are the parts of the lamb maybe we
[1:19:35] go for first oh i want that you know
[1:19:37] because it's the good stuff for us
[1:19:39] we go for the easy stuff things that
[1:19:40] benefit us
[1:19:42] if you want to make anything successful
[1:19:43] just make something in it for somebody
[1:19:44] else and people will will do it if
[1:19:46] there's something in it for them that's
[1:19:47] like the best businesses when you study
[1:19:49] them are actually
[1:19:50] something's in it like like youtube or a
[1:19:52] massive business but it's only because
[1:19:53] people get to go in there and promote
[1:19:55] themselves
[1:19:56] and other people benefit from that
[1:19:57] trademe people get to go in there and
[1:19:59] sell their own things they benefit but
[1:20:01] people make profit off that
[1:20:03] you make something that everyone
[1:20:04] benefits from themselves they're right
[1:20:05] into it for you
[1:20:07] but you try and make someone donate
[1:20:08] money to something that they get nothing
[1:20:09] back from it that's no one's falling
[1:20:11] over themselves to give their money to
[1:20:12] that
[1:20:13] that's why sometimes the kingdom of god
[1:20:14] struggles but it shouldn't
[1:20:17] uh gray we don't so this man another man
[1:20:19] came to jesus there's another piece of
[1:20:21] land
[1:20:22] uh this rich man he said you know what
[1:20:24] what do i have to do he said do all
[1:20:26] these commandments he said you've done
[1:20:27] all those he said i want more thing sell
[1:20:28] all you've got and give it to the poor
[1:20:29] and follow me
[1:20:31] because that's also a part of the word
[1:20:32] of god forsake all and follow me here's
[1:20:34] a piece of land
[1:20:36] this doesn't really benefit me
[1:20:39] i'm not really into this
[1:20:40] and he walked away sorrowful he didn't
[1:20:42] want that
[1:20:43] why because he wasn't part of the of the
[1:20:46] inheritance
[1:20:47] when uh pete when when god said to peter
[1:20:50] jesus said to peter
[1:20:51] uh
[1:20:52] forsake the nets forsake your fishing
[1:20:54] come follow me
[1:20:55] peter was like yup where were we going
[1:20:57] threw his nets away dad you're in charge
[1:20:59] whatever give it to my brother whatever
[1:21:01] i'm gone
[1:21:03] now he did have a little backslide stage
[1:21:04] where he went back once it didn't work
[1:21:06] he i'm going back fishing you know but
[1:21:08] he didn't stay fishing he maybe had it
[1:21:10] he slid back but he went no no no that's
[1:21:12] not i'm following the lord i'll take the
[1:21:14] grave spots
[1:21:16] as well as the green spots
[1:21:18] see when jesus was healing people were
[1:21:20] everyone liked him they were when he was
[1:21:22] feeding the people they were just so
[1:21:23] happy then he then he one day said
[1:21:25] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:21:27] blood you've got no life in you
[1:21:29] and he didn't explain it and that was
[1:21:31] about enough about
[1:21:33] i would say probably 90 of his followers
[1:21:35] thought we can't go along with this
[1:21:38] this doesn't benefit me this is making
[1:21:39] me look rather weird actually and this
[1:21:41] is i don't know if this guy's really all
[1:21:43] there
[1:21:44] there was all this
[1:21:45] pressure
[1:21:46] and they couldn't take it and it said it
[1:21:48] says that that situation
[1:21:50] it says from that time many of his
[1:21:51] disciples went back and walked no more
[1:21:53] with him the land was never for them
[1:21:56] never their land
[1:21:58] then jesus said unto the twelve will you
[1:22:00] go will you also go away and someone
[1:22:01] peter answered answered him lord to whom
[1:22:03] shall we go
[1:22:04] thou has the words of eternal life
[1:22:06] this is part of the promise i'm not
[1:22:07] going to go anywhere else
[1:22:09] and we believe and assure that thou art
[1:22:10] christ the son of the living god
[1:22:13] he's saying i'm not going anywhere i'm
[1:22:14] taking this whole land
[1:22:15] that doesn't this grave it doesn't make
[1:22:17] any sense to me but i'm going to take it
[1:22:18] anyway
[1:22:19] now with the things of god some things
[1:22:21] we understand what the reward is like
[1:22:23] healing oh well i know that when i
[1:22:25] uncover that i'll get healed it's good
[1:22:27] for me some things you don't know why
[1:22:28] you've got to do it and you've got to
[1:22:30] just do it anyway
[1:22:31] you can't see any benefit if i get rid
[1:22:32] of that i've been like that my whole
[1:22:34] life if i get rid of that how will it
[1:22:35] benefit me it will
[1:22:37] that's faith you just take it
[1:22:39] okay
[1:22:42] this is why brother ben preached about
[1:22:43] this about the passover lamb
[1:22:46] and this is along those same lines he
[1:22:47] said
[1:22:48] god said kill the lamb and eat the whole
[1:22:50] lot and that was the type of this
[1:22:52] eat not at ross eat it eat not of it raw
[1:22:55] no sodden at all with water but roast
[1:22:57] with fire his head with his legs and
[1:22:59] with the person that's thereof who knows
[1:23:00] what the pertinence is
[1:23:03] and you should know this brother
[1:23:05] know
[1:23:08] i'm not i'm not joking with the word of
[1:23:09] god but you know if there were
[1:23:11] africans here they'd eat the pertinence
[1:23:13] first you know in this thing because
[1:23:14] it's the the heart the liver or the
[1:23:16] maori boys you know they'll be the heart
[1:23:18] the liver the kidneys they're into that
[1:23:19] first you know
[1:23:20] leave all the steaks to the other people
[1:23:23] but that's what it said don't eat it all
[1:23:24] take take the whole lot
[1:23:26] maybe these people didn't like that sort
[1:23:28] of stuff but he said when you eat the
[1:23:30] lamb take you've got to take the whole
[1:23:31] word not just you can't just take the
[1:23:33] green bits
[1:23:34] gonna take the gray bits the brown bits
[1:23:35] the blue bits take take the whole lot
[1:23:37] okay
[1:23:39] so
[1:23:41] this is why you have issue this this is
[1:23:43] why you have the borderline believer
[1:23:45] type stuff and the other churches
[1:23:48] that that
[1:23:49] this is the way it's in the land just
[1:23:51] across the border here
[1:23:52] they still do have battles and still
[1:23:54] press on but they're only interested in
[1:23:56] the green ones only interested in the
[1:23:58] good things
[1:24:00] i don't know how satan does it because
[1:24:01] the bible says satan can't cast out
[1:24:03] satan
[1:24:05] but i would suspect
[1:24:07] because you think well this stuff gets
[1:24:08] set up and it's in similar land like if
[1:24:10] i if here's the promised land here this
[1:24:12] stuff gets set up here and they do
[1:24:14] actually take land and
[1:24:16] claim things like lord i believe you're
[1:24:18] healer and the healing comes you know
[1:24:20] they
[1:24:21] god honors his word the same and god on
[1:24:22] his faith
[1:24:24] they're just claiming the wrong place so
[1:24:27] so
[1:24:29] i don't know how
[1:24:30] satan would work it but i'm sure he's
[1:24:32] not worried about collateral damage
[1:24:34] like i'm sure
[1:24:35] like you've heard of some stories where
[1:24:36] there's a medieval battle you know and
[1:24:38] the soldiers are out on the in the field
[1:24:40] fighting one
[1:24:42] army's fighting another army's fighting
[1:24:43] and and then
[1:24:45] uh
[1:24:46] maybe the other uh opposing army is
[1:24:49] starting to win so the general up here
[1:24:50] says okay let's just rain down on them
[1:24:52] with arrows
[1:24:54] and that his buddy will say ah our own
[1:24:57] guys are in there yeah well we'll get
[1:24:59] there guys as well
[1:25:00] you know
[1:25:02] so i don't mind let's kill half of our
[1:25:04] guys just to get them because we've got
[1:25:05] plenty more guys lined up here and it's
[1:25:07] going to help us win the battle they're
[1:25:08] just they're what they call collateral
[1:25:10] damage
[1:25:11] i don't know if satan works like that
[1:25:12] but i'm sure he's not worried about
[1:25:13] collateral damage you know he just sits
[1:25:15] at church apparently knows that maybe
[1:25:16] some of his own people are going to get
[1:25:18] wiped out when they get cast out because
[1:25:19] they do actually get cast out because it
[1:25:21] says he can't cast out satan can't cast
[1:25:23] out satan
[1:25:25] but he still does i don't think he cares
[1:25:27] if he
[1:25:28] gets cast you know like
[1:25:30] because he'll set this up to deceive
[1:25:32] people let's see people you talk about
[1:25:34] making a journey
[1:25:36] people get sidetracked on that journey
[1:25:37] and they get oh well this is a promise
[1:25:39] then here like
[1:25:41] some people are coming from a long way
[1:25:42] and as they're making the journey you
[1:25:43] know there's all sorts of people i'll
[1:25:44] stay here live in this land here this is
[1:25:46] good land here they say no no the
[1:25:47] promised land's there
[1:25:48] but there are a lot of people on the
[1:25:50] journey that go oh yeah this probably is
[1:25:52] it similar is it they show photos of the
[1:25:53] land yeah yeah it's very similar it's
[1:25:55] the same this is that yeah you've
[1:25:56] arrived it's promised land
[1:25:57] oh really okay well okay good
[1:26:00] and they set up camp and they're
[1:26:01] battling in the wrong place and all they
[1:26:03] and most of the time in order to make
[1:26:05] these things work you have to just make
[1:26:07] it good
[1:26:08] right that's why this is a this isn't uh
[1:26:12] um
[1:26:13] i forget the version of this it's like a
[1:26:15] um
[1:26:16] this is the scripture in timothy
[1:26:18] there's a bible version where they've
[1:26:20] just kind of expounded to make it read
[1:26:22] really long so you get an idea of what
[1:26:23] it means for the time will come when
[1:26:25] people will not tolerate sound doctrine
[1:26:27] and accurate instructions that
[1:26:29] challenges them with god's truth but
[1:26:31] wanting to have the ears tickle with
[1:26:32] something pleasing they will accumulate
[1:26:34] for themselves many teachers
[1:26:36] one after another chosen to satisfy
[1:26:38] their own desires and to support the
[1:26:40] errors they hold
[1:26:42] and you've got a lot of this happening
[1:26:44] in this day that there's a lot of things
[1:26:45] set up there just
[1:26:47] just all the good stuff you know we'll
[1:26:48] just make it all good for you
[1:26:52] and a lot of it's on human emotion you
[1:26:54] know this is this is your invitation to
[1:26:55] come to church you know to be a part of
[1:26:56] this is the promised land you know if
[1:26:58] you're sad come here we will make you
[1:26:59] happy
[1:27:01] now that is a part of the promise of god
[1:27:04] but but you can't come to church on that
[1:27:05] basis i was sad now i'm happy and i'm
[1:27:07] why do you serve god because i'm just
[1:27:08] happy being here i was sad now i'm happy
[1:27:11] that can't be your pull it's that's not
[1:27:13] the promised land that's just a portion
[1:27:14] of it that that they can claim or like
[1:27:17] if you're lonely come here you'll have
[1:27:19] friends i have no friends now i come to
[1:27:20] church you've got a bunch of friends and
[1:27:21] they shook my hand at the door and
[1:27:23] everything i felt so good warm fuzzies
[1:27:25] now come live happy ever after
[1:27:28] you should the promise of god you should
[1:27:30] be able to go to a church where the word
[1:27:31] of god is again no one shakes your hand
[1:27:32] no one does nothing they don't even
[1:27:34] write your lunch nothing and then you're
[1:27:36] there the next week because there's
[1:27:36] something there that word i heard
[1:27:38] there's something there i'm coming back
[1:27:40] when i want you to come back well i'm
[1:27:41] coming back anyway because i believe
[1:27:43] this you know like the the like the
[1:27:45] sierra the the sierra phoenician woman
[1:27:47] was it that
[1:27:48] they said she was trying to get to jesus
[1:27:50] and they pushed her away said ah
[1:27:53] lady go away you know you're just we're
[1:27:55] all busy just being a you're being a
[1:27:56] pain she said i'm going anyway
[1:27:59] and she finally got to jesus after all
[1:28:01] that trouble he said uh it's not me to
[1:28:03] take the children's bird and give it to
[1:28:04] a dog like you yeah wow you you give
[1:28:08] anyone a bit of opposition these days
[1:28:09] they're gone oh i can't believe didn't
[1:28:11] show me i'm not going back to that
[1:28:12] church
[1:28:13] why because they came in for this reason
[1:28:15] oh they were all good at the start now
[1:28:16] so-and-so didn't invite me to lunch i
[1:28:17] think they're a bit clicky i'm not going
[1:28:19] back
[1:28:20] that's what they signed up for that's
[1:28:21] why when it doesn't happen they're gone
[1:28:24] the kingdom
[1:28:25] god's people are tough you know you can
[1:28:27] kick them out don't come back no they're
[1:28:28] coming back bust the door down i'm
[1:28:30] coming in
[1:28:31] and even when jesus said it's not fit to
[1:28:33] give take the children's bread and give
[1:28:35] it to dogs she said yes lord but the
[1:28:37] dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:28:38] masters table oh this that was her
[1:28:40] attitude there are crumbs are there
[1:28:42] where are they
[1:28:44] you know we
[1:28:45] we don't
[1:28:47] it's our inheritance there's something
[1:28:48] in us that just wants it
[1:28:51] if you're financially poor come here
[1:28:53] you'll get financially rich
[1:28:55] just like now that is true god if you
[1:28:57] serve god there's a high chance if you
[1:28:59] do things correctly
[1:29:01] your wealth will probably be better than
[1:29:03] it was when you weren't serving god
[1:29:04] because god's a provider
[1:29:06] right that that's i don't think you're
[1:29:08] going to go and be poorer unless the
[1:29:09] lord calls you for a season to do
[1:29:11] something you may be
[1:29:12] but you're going to have all that you
[1:29:13] need
[1:29:14] but this has been majored on like
[1:29:16] this is so funny because you know
[1:29:19] the the borderline churches will write
[1:29:20] off anything in the old testament that's
[1:29:22] all old testament we don't go with that
[1:29:23] we're just in the new testament so if
[1:29:24] you try and bring any thing that must be
[1:29:26] abided by that's in the old testament
[1:29:27] they'll quickly write it off
[1:29:29] so you say oh basically tithing is all
[1:29:31] in the old testament i know we keep that
[1:29:32] though that one's you know
[1:29:35] quoting the scripture god's you know
[1:29:36] week after week you know the old
[1:29:38] testament only because it benefits them
[1:29:39] because that's part of the green one
[1:29:42] uh so this is like now i'm not saying
[1:29:44] these things don't
[1:29:45] aren't part of the kingdom of god
[1:29:46] because they are but this is just how
[1:29:47] this stuff
[1:29:49] uh but
[1:29:51] jesus now this is not all that it is but
[1:29:53] you know if you want to be despised and
[1:29:55] rejected and hated without a cause
[1:29:56] you're keen on that
[1:29:58] uh and forsake everything and for the
[1:30:00] benefit of this uh for the
[1:30:02] pleasure of this you've got to forsake
[1:30:03] everything else and make me king of your
[1:30:05] life then come follow me anyone want to
[1:30:06] sign up
[1:30:08] see
[1:30:10] this is how
[1:30:12] because why because it's a part of you
[1:30:14] there's a promise there
[1:30:16] it's part of i have a promise that's
[1:30:19] jesus doesn't have to do this big cell
[1:30:21] come on come on please i'll make you
[1:30:22] feel happy come on no he just keeps on
[1:30:24] walking you're like jesus i'm coming
[1:30:25] where we're going you know
[1:30:27] that because there's something in us
[1:30:28] that's how that's what a real believer
[1:30:30] that's why brother said you don't need
[1:30:31] to baby people and you don't need to
[1:30:33] he's even got too many hot house plants
[1:30:35] that are used to growing in hot houses
[1:30:36] you know greenhouses you you put these
[1:30:38] things in the sun for a day out in the
[1:30:40] elements a bit of wind comes and they
[1:30:41] get blown over because they're not used
[1:30:42] to any wind not used to any hardship
[1:30:45] that but that's not us
[1:30:47] okay
[1:30:48] that's why we go yes they came from the
[1:30:51] east and west they came from a landfill
[1:30:53] that's there's something in that
[1:30:54] promised land along the way people are
[1:30:56] going to try and make us just have this
[1:30:58] here have that they have that no no it's
[1:31:00] over here
[1:31:01] my sheep hear my voice and the stranger
[1:31:03] they will not follow we're on our way to
[1:31:04] this land
[1:31:05] and
[1:31:06] there is something in you
[1:31:08] if you
[1:31:10] have a if you're part of that land then
[1:31:12] you will take all the land
[1:31:14] because that's a part of you this is not
[1:31:16] like you won't get there and then there
[1:31:18] were people there that like oh you know
[1:31:20] and you took half i don't believe that's
[1:31:22] the attitude of
[1:31:24] someone if they've got the
[1:31:25] if it's their inheritance that's not
[1:31:27] their attitude
[1:31:30] is just an encouragement that this is
[1:31:31] just i'm just reminding you what your
[1:31:33] attitude is which is from jordan to the
[1:31:34] sea that's my attitude
[1:31:37] okay
[1:31:38] so here we go these ones
[1:31:40] now we're going to go through like
[1:31:43] some of the different things you know
[1:31:45] that we so we go if we went for some of
[1:31:47] the green ones you know oh there's
[1:31:49] healing here praise the lord there's
[1:31:50] healing you know we will probably
[1:31:52] as human beings say we will take the
[1:31:54] path of least resistance and we will go
[1:31:55] for the things that benefit us first is
[1:31:56] that what we do we've got to be honest
[1:31:59] god made us selfish for a good reason
[1:32:01] like you think if a baby like a baby is
[1:32:03] completely selfish
[1:32:05] but it's a function of life you know
[1:32:06] imagine if a baby was selfless and just
[1:32:08] no that's right you go first like it
[1:32:10] will be it will starve to death oh no i
[1:32:13] won't cry it's all right
[1:32:14] you guys are busy i know
[1:32:16] i know you're busy you can't really look
[1:32:18] after me i'll just be unselfish and you
[1:32:20] guys just go first and don't worry about
[1:32:21] me
[1:32:22] because it cannot fem for itself
[1:32:24] it's got to be selfish it's like i'm
[1:32:26] hungry man
[1:32:28] me
[1:32:29] me
[1:32:30] feed me now
[1:32:32] i don't care if you're tired i don't
[1:32:35] care
[1:32:36] if you haven't slept i don't care if
[1:32:37] there's no food
[1:32:38] find some and give it to me
[1:32:41] you know
[1:32:42] but it's a function of life
[1:32:45] god didn't make it like that babies
[1:32:46] would die suddenly you'll be odd little
[1:32:49] johnny's dead i haven't been him for
[1:32:51] four days
[1:32:54] no i knew it
[1:32:55] that's the fourth one
[1:32:59] you know
[1:33:01] god's designed humanity like that even
[1:33:04] i won't this
[1:33:06] but but even with the good land
[1:33:09] these are easy ones to take because you
[1:33:10] know you you know what the result of
[1:33:13] getting it is going to be so you're
[1:33:14] going to put a bit more of an effort to
[1:33:15] get it
[1:33:16] and but you're you're always going to
[1:33:18] get opposition to any part of the land
[1:33:20] you take like
[1:33:21] you'll hear a science says it can't
[1:33:22] happen if you're scientifically minded
[1:33:24] how's that going to happen you know how
[1:33:25] can i be healed
[1:33:26] i know that this part is broken here and
[1:33:28] that's there and that's like this and it
[1:33:30] cannot scientifically happen
[1:33:33] and that's naturally the truth but god
[1:33:35] can do anything
[1:33:37] i like to make sense of god and this
[1:33:38] makes sense to me that god has codes and
[1:33:40] he can just go
[1:33:42] you're healed
[1:33:44] right uh oh this just runs in the family
[1:33:46] it's just kind of part of you know
[1:33:48] he ready to tear you just just live with
[1:33:49] us you know
[1:33:51] you're gonna have opposition as soon as
[1:33:52] you try and claim a promise or yeah just
[1:33:54] live with it just don't worry about to
[1:33:55] live with it but you don't have to
[1:34:00] but then as with all of this there's
[1:34:02] surrounding land you know you take it
[1:34:03] you realize oh there's actually other
[1:34:04] bits of land around here that are kind
[1:34:05] of
[1:34:06] kind of you know it's not all like i can
[1:34:08] just claim my healing and everything's
[1:34:09] done and dusted sometimes you get sick
[1:34:11] it's a punishment you you've done
[1:34:13] something and you get you something
[1:34:14] happens you're like lord heal me but
[1:34:16] you've got to be honest with yourself
[1:34:17] have i done anything or do you check it
[1:34:19] all first
[1:34:20] this is not just child's play
[1:34:22] you know you can't just pretend
[1:34:24] everything's all rosy maybe it's not
[1:34:25] maybe you've done something
[1:34:27] now that's for you to decide not for you
[1:34:29] to decide oh bro you must have done
[1:34:31] something that's why your legs like that
[1:34:32] well that's not for me to decide as far
[1:34:34] as i'm concerned your leg here we pray
[1:34:36] for you
[1:34:37] but i am
[1:34:40] i've got to have confidence as long as
[1:34:41] you know
[1:34:42] you're all good then i pray for you you
[1:34:44] know
[1:34:45] because we
[1:34:46] like it like as and
[1:34:48] paul said and even brother brown talks
[1:34:50] about sometimes you can cast something
[1:34:51] off someone will
[1:34:53] use that power to take something away
[1:34:54] from them that they're supposed to have
[1:34:55] because it's
[1:34:56] something they're supposed to go through
[1:34:58] right
[1:34:58] sometimes it's just a long trial it just
[1:35:00] goes for a long time and you wonder lord
[1:35:02] i have this for 10 years
[1:35:04] but sometimes it's how you go through it
[1:35:05] that inspires other people they think
[1:35:07] look at this person they just go week
[1:35:08] after week trust in god i think i can
[1:35:10] too i can trust in god too if they can i
[1:35:13] can week after week month after month
[1:35:15] year after year sometimes it's just a
[1:35:17] thorn in your flesh this is all part of
[1:35:19] the land when we when we take it we
[1:35:20] realize oh there's little bits of land
[1:35:21] here too oh you know like paul said lord
[1:35:24] get rid of this
[1:35:26] some people say it was his eyes he
[1:35:27] couldn't see that well other people say
[1:35:28] it was different things but it was a
[1:35:29] bodily function that didn't quite work
[1:35:30] properly he said lord deliver me of this
[1:35:32] and the lord said no i'm just going to
[1:35:33] leave that there my grace is sufficient
[1:35:35] for you you've just got to have this
[1:35:37] little thing to keep you down so you
[1:35:38] don't get too carried away think you're
[1:35:40] all this you're always going to have
[1:35:41] this little almond that's just going to
[1:35:42] hold you back just a bit you know some
[1:35:44] people said it was a stutter so try to
[1:35:45] preach and it'd stutter away you know
[1:35:48] whatever it was
[1:35:50] sometimes we just have those so you this
[1:35:52] is all this
[1:35:54] joy oh i want joy you know you might be
[1:35:56] depressed i want joy you know
[1:35:57] because joy makes you feel good right
[1:35:59] you don't you don't want to be he wants
[1:36:00] to be unhappy
[1:36:04] you want to feel good but you see you
[1:36:06] try and get that
[1:36:07] you realize it's inheritance there's joy
[1:36:10] as an inheritance
[1:36:11] right that's right these things have i
[1:36:12] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[1:36:14] in you and that your joy may be full
[1:36:15] this is an inheritance
[1:36:17] right so it's part of it it's part of
[1:36:18] the promise
[1:36:20] but when you go and try and get it
[1:36:21] you'll get this thing off that's okay to
[1:36:23] kind of be down
[1:36:25] always be always be that it's okay it's
[1:36:27] okay just it's normal
[1:36:30] you'll be happy when things get better
[1:36:32] when it gets better just because of all
[1:36:33] these things you go through while you're
[1:36:34] down
[1:36:35] when they're all sorted you'll be happy
[1:36:37] if you believe that there'll always be
[1:36:38] something going on you'll always be done
[1:36:40] see
[1:36:40] always
[1:36:42] you understand this now we understand
[1:36:44] there's a there's a level of up and down
[1:36:45] that human emotions have to go through
[1:36:46] and that's also for our protection like
[1:36:48] your emotions are there to protect you
[1:36:51] once again like the crying thing if you
[1:36:53] didn't have an emotion to feel scared or
[1:36:54] to feel uneasy in a situation
[1:36:57] then you could stay in a very bad
[1:36:58] situation and maybe even to your death
[1:37:00] because you didn't discern that you felt
[1:37:02] bad you know these emotions if you feel
[1:37:04] uncomfortable in a situation
[1:37:06] like if there's an abusive thing you
[1:37:09] you you get an emotion that you're
[1:37:10] scared
[1:37:11] but that's to tell you to act hey you're
[1:37:13] there's something could harm you you
[1:37:15] need to get out of the situation that's
[1:37:16] an emotion but if you're just scared at
[1:37:18] every little thing something pops up
[1:37:19] you're scared you're scared you're
[1:37:20] scared you're scared
[1:37:22] you know and you live in fear that's not
[1:37:23] that that's satan always tries to take
[1:37:25] it all too far you're not supposed to
[1:37:26] live like that but you do
[1:37:28] you do have a healthy balance of
[1:37:30] emotions a believer
[1:37:31] like a natural person has to have that a
[1:37:33] little bit up a little bit down there
[1:37:34] you you get a bit downhill this is tough
[1:37:37] but
[1:37:38] you
[1:37:39] as a human but
[1:37:40] so you you can't say oh i'm a down today
[1:37:42] maybe i'm not a believer there's a
[1:37:43] certain amount you have to allow for but
[1:37:45] when you notice this man this is getting
[1:37:46] me down and it's affecting my walk it's
[1:37:47] affecting everything then you need to
[1:37:49] stop that
[1:37:50] that's not part of the land my
[1:37:51] inheritance is lord i'm full of joy
[1:37:53] okay
[1:37:55] but sometimes things don't quite work
[1:37:56] out and you just um
[1:37:59] i just want to point this out because
[1:38:01] like you don't just a lot of the times
[1:38:03] when we get things we're happy
[1:38:06] but sometimes when we've got nothing to
[1:38:07] be happy for god wants to say are you
[1:38:08] still happy yeah and he might bring us
[1:38:10] through things take everything away to
[1:38:12] see
[1:38:13] okay let's just hone in on that joy
[1:38:15] you're talking about so let's take
[1:38:16] everything that makes you happy let's
[1:38:18] take that all away
[1:38:20] let's see yeah and god does that let's
[1:38:22] see if you you know you think man i
[1:38:24] didn't i thought when i come in the land
[1:38:25] and claim this ground it's just going to
[1:38:26] be full of joy and everything's going to
[1:38:27] be happy ever after well it is but
[1:38:30] there's a little bit of land next to it
[1:38:31] he's gonna you gotta get as well which
[1:38:32] is maybe
[1:38:34] can you be happy when it's all falling
[1:38:35] apart when nothing's working where is
[1:38:37] your joy
[1:38:38] where is it
[1:38:39] see you because they they've got this
[1:38:41] promise in the in the borderline but
[1:38:43] that's just you know most of the time
[1:38:44] it's just because they've got the other
[1:38:45] promise which is get heaps of money i've
[1:38:47] got money i'm happy yeah everything's
[1:38:48] going good you know i got that promotion
[1:38:50] at work i'm happy
[1:38:51] you know what about hey hey guys i just
[1:38:53] lost my job i don't know how i'm gonna
[1:38:54] survive praise the lord
[1:38:56] it's probably more of a testimony
[1:39:00] now we have promises for family this is
[1:39:02] part of the land although it's natural
[1:39:04] it's actually a part of the land
[1:39:06] we based that on this
[1:39:08] this
[1:39:10] episode in acts where paul said
[1:39:12] where the the the prison was shaken that
[1:39:14] and paul and silas got out and the
[1:39:16] jailer was scared because
[1:39:19] he he knew his life was on the line if
[1:39:21] he lets his prisoners escape he's done
[1:39:23] for and he said
[1:39:24] and he was he was going to kill himself
[1:39:26] because when he realized they were
[1:39:27] escaped it's like well i might as well
[1:39:28] kill myself now because i'll be
[1:39:30] publicly executed tomorrow anyway so
[1:39:34] um
[1:39:35] but paul preached to him and
[1:39:36] he said to paul
[1:39:39] what must i do and he said believe on
[1:39:41] the lord jesus christ and you will be
[1:39:42] saved and your house
[1:39:44] so now
[1:39:46] because we take paul's word as being the
[1:39:48] revealed word of god
[1:39:50] then then we this is where we apply that
[1:39:53] scripture to our life and say well if
[1:39:55] paul said that to him
[1:39:57] and gave him a promise i believe that
[1:39:58] was a promise from god to paul so we can
[1:40:01] claim that for ourselves we can say lord
[1:40:03] the promise is
[1:40:04] me and my house
[1:40:06] we can claim that promise this is where
[1:40:09] we we base it on this is what they call
[1:40:10] like in court they have like a precedent
[1:40:13] oh well we will judge this in this case
[1:40:14] because in that case they judged it
[1:40:16] there so this is the same case we'll
[1:40:17] judge it this way
[1:40:18] this is this is
[1:40:20] but you see you're going to have this
[1:40:21] opposition oh no they won't come in no
[1:40:22] no no no it's not really you can see
[1:40:24] they've said they're not coming in you
[1:40:25] know they're not just gonna you're not
[1:40:27] just gonna claim this then the devil
[1:40:28] just gives it all up yeah take him yeah
[1:40:30] you're right actually i didn't realize
[1:40:31] that was in there he's yours she's yours
[1:40:33] you know here you go
[1:40:36] uh
[1:40:38] you know and oftentimes it cause you
[1:40:40] know you say it's going to cause a lot
[1:40:41] of friction in your family if you keep
[1:40:42] up the stance you know look it's already
[1:40:43] causing a lot of trouble just
[1:40:45] don't worry about it just keep the peace
[1:40:47] let them do what they do and just be one
[1:40:48] big happy family you know don't don't
[1:40:50] claim this land
[1:40:52] he's not going to give up easy
[1:40:55] but there's a little bit of surrounding
[1:40:56] land
[1:40:58] we think we think we're going to walk
[1:40:59] into this land everything's just going
[1:41:00] to be easy
[1:41:02] the surrounding landers think not that i
[1:41:03] am come to see peace on earth i am not
[1:41:05] come to see peace but a sword
[1:41:08] i am come to set a man at variance
[1:41:09] against his father and the daughter
[1:41:11] against their mother and the
[1:41:12] daughter-in-law against her
[1:41:13] mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be
[1:41:15] those of his own household he that
[1:41:16] loveth father or mother more than me is
[1:41:18] not worthy of me and hear that love a
[1:41:19] son or daughter more than me is not
[1:41:21] worthy of me and he that taketh not his
[1:41:23] cross and followeth after me is not
[1:41:24] worthy of me
[1:41:26] when you get to that situation where it
[1:41:28] all looks like it's bleak
[1:41:30] and you're tempted to go uh i'm either
[1:41:32] gonna this is causing too much friction
[1:41:34] i've got two options
[1:41:35] i can either give up and just allow
[1:41:38] whatever it is and say yeah look i'll
[1:41:39] just become more like you and we'll just
[1:41:41] compromise and like say your wayward son
[1:41:43] or daughter and then let's just keep the
[1:41:45] peace and yet all good i'll just start
[1:41:46] my social drinking with you more just
[1:41:48] you know
[1:41:49] or do you say look if that's going to be
[1:41:51] your stance you and i are going to be
[1:41:53] at odds
[1:41:57] all those dreams i had of us being buddy
[1:41:59] buddy and you know we're going to have
[1:42:00] good father son everybody's going to be
[1:42:02] great
[1:42:04] we're going to build this house together
[1:42:05] and do whatever
[1:42:07] that's off
[1:42:08] because i'm going this way you're going
[1:42:10] that way there's going to be friction
[1:42:12] just divided and that's it but i'm not
[1:42:14] going back that way i'm going this way
[1:42:15] if you go that way then then they will
[1:42:18] see jesus says if you come into that
[1:42:20] situation what are you going to do
[1:42:24] are you going to go a lot of people i've
[1:42:25] seen it they'll compromise you know that
[1:42:28] even the husband and wife the the wife
[1:42:29] wants to go the husband doesn't or vice
[1:42:31] versa and and then the wife or the
[1:42:33] husband will compromise just for the
[1:42:34] sake of keeping the peace
[1:42:37] but if you're going into this land you
[1:42:38] won't
[1:42:39] now that might sound harsh but this is
[1:42:41] the surrounding land you'll say no no
[1:42:43] i'm not compromising
[1:42:44] and if you don't want to come then
[1:42:48] then then where do we go from here how
[1:42:50] can two walk through unless they be
[1:42:51] agreed
[1:42:52] no
[1:42:54] that doesn't say god doesn't keep his
[1:42:55] promise because he does but
[1:42:57] sometimes you've got to go down this
[1:42:59] path to see do you do you really do you
[1:43:01] want this or not
[1:43:02] how much is it worth to you
[1:43:07] money who wants lots of money
[1:43:09] no one's going to put their hand up but
[1:43:10] the people the people that are honest do
[1:43:14] i want lots to give to the kingdom of
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:17] that's that's the only the only desire
[1:43:19] in me to make money is to give to the
[1:43:20] kingdom of god so you can push the
[1:43:21] kingdom of god forward
[1:43:23] you know but
[1:43:26] but there are promises of provision and
[1:43:28] blessing in the word of god in the land
[1:43:30] there's a promise there bring all the
[1:43:32] ties into the storehouse that maybe meet
[1:43:33] in the mind house and prove me now here
[1:43:35] with saith the lord of hosts that fall
[1:43:36] not open you the windows of heaven and
[1:43:38] pour you out a blessing that there
[1:43:39] should not be enough to receive it
[1:43:41] great verse for the borderline believers
[1:43:43] yeah just claim this promise people they
[1:43:44] wave their money up you know before they
[1:43:46] put it in you know and they get it we
[1:43:48] get it because it's a promise they're
[1:43:50] just claiming it in the wrong land you
[1:43:52] know
[1:43:52] wasting time you might as well not even
[1:43:54] do this just go and be an unbelieving
[1:43:56] business person shaft everyone around
[1:43:57] and make some money that way don't
[1:43:58] bother doing this way probably make more
[1:44:00] money that way
[1:44:01] but
[1:44:03] but you see even in doing that you still
[1:44:04] get opposition to that you're still
[1:44:06] going to say well satan's going to say
[1:44:07] well that won't work if you give your
[1:44:08] money away technically you're not going
[1:44:09] to have it that
[1:44:12] you have a hundred dollars to give away
[1:44:13] 10 20 you're only going to have 80. you
[1:44:16] are going to be poor you realize that
[1:44:18] and you've got bills to pay this week
[1:44:19] you need 100. you're going to give your
[1:44:21] number 90
[1:44:22] i'm going to work maths don't add up
[1:44:24] that's what you it's not going to be
[1:44:26] yeah you're right yeah give it because
[1:44:28] you're going to be blessed god's going
[1:44:29] to bless you he's going to find another
[1:44:30] way to pay your bills he's not going to
[1:44:32] tell you that
[1:44:33] it's a bit tight this week same as it
[1:44:34] has been for the last couple of weeks
[1:44:36] maybe last six months but
[1:44:38] when it gets better you'll be able to do
[1:44:39] it yeah
[1:44:41] that's what he's going to say
[1:44:43] right
[1:44:43] hey that's what he says he's not going
[1:44:45] to give up easy
[1:44:47] even though but the reason why we're
[1:44:48] more prone to do this is because we can
[1:44:50] see on the other the green ones mean we
[1:44:52] can see what the result will be and
[1:44:53] that'll be good so we're gonna we want
[1:44:54] it because we kind of know there's a
[1:44:55] good result
[1:44:57] okay
[1:44:58] but then there's surrounding land which
[1:44:59] is us things like this but godliness
[1:45:01] with contentment is great gain
[1:45:03] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:45:05] and in certain we can carry nothing out
[1:45:07] and having food and raiment let us be
[1:45:09] there with content got food clothes
[1:45:11] you're happy
[1:45:12] but they that will be rich fall into
[1:45:14] temptation and a snare into many foolish
[1:45:16] and hurtful lust with drum men and
[1:45:17] destruction and petition for the love of
[1:45:19] money is the root of all evil which
[1:45:21] while some coveted after they have aired
[1:45:23] from the faith and passed themselves
[1:45:24] through with many sorrows
[1:45:26] people that have chased after it and let
[1:45:28] it become their god it's destroyed them
[1:45:30] but that doesn't mean you can't have a
[1:45:31] whole lot it won't destroy you you see
[1:45:33] this there's all the surrounding land
[1:45:34] that
[1:45:36] that we want
[1:45:37] spouse who wants us you know oh the
[1:45:39] there
[1:45:40] i know this is natural again but there
[1:45:42] no doubt there is a promise of a of a
[1:45:44] god-given
[1:45:45] husband or wife for you in the land you
[1:45:47] know you serve god god
[1:45:48] the scripture says who so findeth the
[1:45:50] wife findeth the good thing and obtain
[1:45:51] the favor of the lord and we know that
[1:45:53] there's a promise in there so you can
[1:45:55] lay claim on that
[1:45:58] if you want to and if you feel too you
[1:45:59] can it's in the land right
[1:46:02] but then you satan's not gonna say yeah
[1:46:04] yeah no you're right go there's a lot of
[1:46:05] good believers here you know he's maybe
[1:46:07] gonna start getting you to get someone
[1:46:08] else you know plenty of other believers
[1:46:10] outside of you know fair they're good
[1:46:12] people good girl she's a good girl
[1:46:15] she's a good girl
[1:46:17] but it'll give you trouble later on
[1:46:18] maybe
[1:46:20] uh don't wait too long they'll all be
[1:46:21] taking just a quick quick you're in your
[1:46:22] 30s now go quickly
[1:46:25] you'll be left on the shelf you know
[1:46:26] just
[1:46:27] snap up anybody you know that hey
[1:46:29] they're all being married off
[1:46:31] don't do it see yeah
[1:46:34] even though it's in the land
[1:46:36] potentially
[1:46:37] but there's other ones
[1:46:39] paul's addressed this once and he said
[1:46:40] it's actually better to remain single
[1:46:42] just stay like i am then you can just
[1:46:44] serve the lord you've got no troubles
[1:46:45] as soon as you get married you're going
[1:46:46] to have trouble in the flesh it's going
[1:46:48] to it's going to bring a whole new
[1:46:49] element into your life
[1:46:51] you can't fully serve god you've got to
[1:46:52] look after your husband and wife you've
[1:46:53] got it desires are going to be split
[1:46:55] that's okay but he just said that's the
[1:46:57] way it's going to be so
[1:46:58] overall you're better if you just stay
[1:47:00] single because then you're 100 focused
[1:47:02] guys angles on the lord you can just
[1:47:03] serve the lord everything's good stay
[1:47:05] that way but if you go the other way
[1:47:07] it's fine but you're going to have
[1:47:07] troubles there
[1:47:09] but there are times where some people
[1:47:11] just can't dwell together peacefully
[1:47:13] it just doesn't work out
[1:47:16] and and
[1:47:17] there and even in that there's a there's
[1:47:19] a there's an allowance to say if you
[1:47:21] physically can't if you just can't get
[1:47:23] along then you're better off not to be
[1:47:25] together
[1:47:27] see but even in this there are believers
[1:47:30] in this situation but but even in this
[1:47:33] god knows
[1:47:35] now
[1:47:37] do you think god didn't know when you
[1:47:38] did that when it didn't work out he knew
[1:47:40] he knew when you started he knew and it
[1:47:42] didn't work out
[1:47:43] sure if you didn't
[1:47:45] i'm confident of this
[1:47:48] that
[1:47:49] if you're a son or daughter of god that
[1:47:51] he could have stopped it if he wanted to
[1:47:52] there's a purpose for everything
[1:47:54] sometimes you know sometimes you don't
[1:47:56] but there is a purpose
[1:47:57] like in this one here then this is just
[1:48:00] me being honest when i see people that
[1:48:01] maybe it hasn't worked out and they're
[1:48:03] separated but i see them still pressing
[1:48:05] on serving the lord and coming to church
[1:48:07] they don't realize how much it inspires
[1:48:10] me
[1:48:11] i think and this is the truth i'm not
[1:48:13] making this up to make people feel good
[1:48:15] i sit back at home when i'm maybe going
[1:48:16] through a rough patch and i think if
[1:48:18] they can do it under their circumstances
[1:48:20] so can i
[1:48:22] it inspires me i look at that and i
[1:48:23] think i want to be like that i want to
[1:48:25] have that same sort of tenacity lord
[1:48:27] and i it encourages me to push on now
[1:48:30] that person doesn't those people i'm
[1:48:31] sure don't know that
[1:48:33] they influenced me
[1:48:34] but at the end of the road they will see
[1:48:36] maybe not realizing it lord i thought i
[1:48:38] just battled away and you know my
[1:48:39] husband we couldn't get along and we had
[1:48:41] to sort of separate they and then they
[1:48:43] know they can't marry someone else and
[1:48:44] it's just now i just i'll just battle
[1:48:45] the way i thought it was just my life
[1:48:47] was pretty mediocre
[1:48:48] but they one day they will see the
[1:48:50] impact that they had because it's all
[1:48:52] for a purpose it's all for a purpose
[1:48:55] now some things
[1:48:58] some things you
[1:49:00] you don't know that you
[1:49:02] i've made these gray where you don't
[1:49:03] know the outcome of what the other thing
[1:49:05] will be
[1:49:07] these are the things you sort of maybe
[1:49:08] don't want to get rid of maybe you're
[1:49:08] used to living your whole life this is
[1:49:10] probably more guys you know you just get
[1:49:11] angry yeah i told him where to go you
[1:49:13] know yeah
[1:49:14] it's your you and that's always been
[1:49:16] your reaction is anger or something and
[1:49:18] people know you oh man don't mess with
[1:49:19] him he gets angry and you quick sort it
[1:49:21] out
[1:49:22] that's how you operate right
[1:49:24] and you know no different
[1:49:26] and you just you maybe
[1:49:30] but some things in this land you don't
[1:49:32] know what the other side when you take
[1:49:34] that land you don't know what's there
[1:49:36] that's you just got to do it if the
[1:49:37] bible says stop being angry
[1:49:40] but i've always been angry this is how
[1:49:41] i've operated whenever someone messes
[1:49:43] with me i just get angry if i'm at work
[1:49:46] but and you don't know the you don't
[1:49:48] know what how it would be if you didn't
[1:49:51] but if you get told not to
[1:49:53] then this is you've got to take that
[1:49:54] word as well don't just take the stuff
[1:49:56] you can see the good result
[1:49:58] well lord i've just always done this no
[1:50:00] stop
[1:50:01] what's there if i stop
[1:50:03] that doesn't matter
[1:50:05] there could be worse thing there for you
[1:50:07] who cares
[1:50:08] i said stop so stop
[1:50:10] this is how we do you understand
[1:50:14] now i've just got these these ones here
[1:50:15] are just like these ones you know you
[1:50:16] someone always gets depressed
[1:50:18] stop
[1:50:19] oh but it's how i've always done things
[1:50:21] happen to me and i just start it really
[1:50:22] gets me down and no no you've got to
[1:50:23] defeat that thing but that's all i know
[1:50:26] what it what's there if i take it what
[1:50:28] what's what's part of the land
[1:50:30] you'll find that here will be patience
[1:50:33] i just i decided my day to stop i said
[1:50:35] lord i want to take this
[1:50:37] there's this thing there and i just want
[1:50:38] to overtake it your word says to take it
[1:50:40] now
[1:50:41] where is this from jordan to the sea yes
[1:50:45] i don't understand it but it's there
[1:50:46] it's between jordan and the sea i'm
[1:50:47] taking this one if the bible says don't
[1:50:50] do it then i'm not doing it
[1:50:51] now when you overtake it you'll find the
[1:50:53] land there's way better
[1:50:54] you know
[1:50:56] it's way way better depressed lord
[1:50:58] always get depressed all the time
[1:51:01] certain degree okay
[1:51:03] big amount
[1:51:06] deal with it somehow
[1:51:08] some way
[1:51:09] but lord what will there be if i don't
[1:51:11] that's that's my go-to it's my go-to
[1:51:13] place
[1:51:15] don't go there
[1:51:17] just don't go there
[1:51:18] like it's if it's between jordan and the
[1:51:21] sea
[1:51:22] i'm not gonna say it's easy
[1:51:24] because a battle when you're fighting to
[1:51:25] the death
[1:51:27] it's not easy i'm not up here saying
[1:51:28] just deal with it it's easy come on you
[1:51:30] know it's not like that
[1:51:32] i'm not saying this is all going to be
[1:51:34] easy what i'm saying is you all have it
[1:51:35] in you to take the whole land because
[1:51:37] you had a desire for it you all have it
[1:51:39] in you and you can do it that's what i'm
[1:51:41] saying
[1:51:42] is it going to be easy probably not
[1:51:43] you're going to have a few scars along
[1:51:44] the way probably
[1:51:46] well some things you battle with for
[1:51:47] years maybe but you all overcome you
[1:51:50] will all overcome because
[1:51:51] you desire to
[1:51:54] if you are used to sort of being the guy
[1:51:55] that's just telling all sorts of
[1:51:56] suggestions
[1:51:58] or you know
[1:52:00] guys are a bit more humorous guys will
[1:52:02] do that maybe girls are a bit more
[1:52:03] gossipy you know you just love to
[1:52:05] kind of you know when you're gossiping
[1:52:07] because some things you have to say as
[1:52:09] as fact like if i have a
[1:52:11] say say we we're doing a film you know
[1:52:13] and we've got crew and someone isn't
[1:52:16] quite working
[1:52:17] and i've got a
[1:52:19] assistant director that we've got to
[1:52:20] talk about things and i say i can't just
[1:52:22] say oh you know they're really good you
[1:52:24] know
[1:52:25] everything's good
[1:52:27] i've got to be honest and say look that
[1:52:28] person there is absolutely hopeless they
[1:52:30] cannot do their job they're causing
[1:52:31] trouble with all this and that now
[1:52:34] i'm not gossiping about them or talking
[1:52:35] about it to them behind their back
[1:52:38] although i'm talking bad about them and
[1:52:39] then they don't know what i'm saying
[1:52:41] but it's i've got a job to do i've got
[1:52:43] to tell you that this is causing trouble
[1:52:44] in our department
[1:52:46] they're causing this issue but there's
[1:52:48] no
[1:52:49] malice in me to want to bring them down
[1:52:51] i'm not like ah i'm going to run them
[1:52:52] down to here and and make you not like
[1:52:54] them it's like so there's a certain
[1:52:56] degree of honesty that
[1:52:59] even brother branham when they were
[1:53:00] driving to visit some brother i think he
[1:53:02] was telling perry green about all the
[1:53:03] things these brothers have done all the
[1:53:04] bad things you know
[1:53:06] and
[1:53:07] but he was just explaining this is
[1:53:08] what's happened because he's maybe as
[1:53:10] leadership at a church these are the
[1:53:11] situations
[1:53:12] this is what's going on
[1:53:14] and
[1:53:15] brother perry granted by the end of it
[1:53:17] he was ready to roll up his sleeves and
[1:53:18] give these boys a beating you know
[1:53:20] and
[1:53:21] and he said um they were driving along
[1:53:22] he said oh they live just over here
[1:53:24] let's go and see them we'll call and say
[1:53:25] hello so what i was going to beat them
[1:53:28] up
[1:53:29] you know but it wasn't gossip it wasn't
[1:53:31] malice there was no
[1:53:32] it just was facts it was information
[1:53:35] just like um paul said of peter
[1:53:37] oh when i went there peter did this he
[1:53:39] wrote into the scriptures peter got a
[1:53:41] bit embarrassed about this you know he
[1:53:43] didn't want the jews to see him come
[1:53:44] with me so you know this is what
[1:53:45] happened
[1:53:46] don't use that as a as a now a um
[1:53:50] free ticket to gossip
[1:53:52] because you know
[1:53:53] there's a there's a point where you can
[1:53:55] say some facts about a situation then
[1:53:56] you know when it's gone now
[1:53:58] now you've got something and it's just
[1:53:59] now oh and by the way did you also know
[1:54:01] me
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:03] see
[1:54:04] and usually there are very few people to
[1:54:06] say negative things about
[1:54:09] it's usually in some sort of leadership
[1:54:11] thing when you've got to be honest about
[1:54:12] something to other people and that it
[1:54:14] concerns but like i wouldn't
[1:54:16] say say in a film crew i wouldn't go and
[1:54:18] talk to mikey or mikey that that guy
[1:54:21] over there is utterly useless honestly
[1:54:23] don't do nothing you know well i try not
[1:54:25] to anyway maybe i'll get lacked but i
[1:54:26] would
[1:54:27] because i wouldn't run them down to
[1:54:29] mikey because mikey is he doesn't
[1:54:32] it doesn't consume him
[1:54:34] okay
[1:54:35] but but god wants the in the land this
[1:54:37] is not there you know if you're always
[1:54:40] joking around saying crude stuff don't
[1:54:41] just don't say it what am i going to
[1:54:42] talk about stop saying it and you'll
[1:54:44] figure out some you maybe you'll have
[1:54:45] conversation season with grace
[1:54:48] you might have other things you can say
[1:54:49] instead there'll be something better
[1:54:51] there but sometimes you don't know what
[1:54:52] it is
[1:54:53] that's what when we talk about taking
[1:54:55] the whole end take the ones that that
[1:54:57] you don't know if there's a good result
[1:54:59] in there for you just take it anyway
[1:55:00] okay
[1:55:01] uh in your mind you know you might have
[1:55:03] just filled your mind up with all sorts
[1:55:04] of movies and music and stuff and then
[1:55:06] god says stop all that oh wow this is
[1:55:08] the most of us all right
[1:55:10] stop it all
[1:55:11] what am i going to fill my mind with
[1:55:13] you'll see
[1:55:14] take it away you'll you'll find now to
[1:55:16] be filled with something better it's
[1:55:18] going to work out better
[1:55:20] but at the time you think man this is
[1:55:21] when i sit down on a friday i do this
[1:55:23] and you know on my car driving along in
[1:55:25] the morning you know
[1:55:27] maybe take it away
[1:55:29] you maybe don't understand but just take
[1:55:30] it away
[1:55:33] god doesn't just mess around and he
[1:55:35] expects us to do things that we don't
[1:55:36] understand why that's right we don't
[1:55:38] understand where
[1:55:40] he expects us to do things where there
[1:55:41] is no good in it for us
[1:55:43] it can't just be all like oh heal me
[1:55:44] look because i can see when i'm healed
[1:55:45] i'm happy it's got it you got to take
[1:55:47] the whole lot
[1:55:49] well you've got to dress a certain way
[1:55:50] you can't just dress all this and that
[1:55:52] and you know like all the brothers here
[1:55:54] look like that if they take their shirt
[1:55:55] off you know
[1:56:05] and i've been camping with the brothers
[1:56:06] i know you know
[1:56:08] they're in the lounge you know
[1:56:11] but this
[1:56:12] will a way you portray yourself and god
[1:56:15] says there's a way you present yourself
[1:56:16] it's not that yes ah but i've always
[1:56:19] done this you know unlike got a good
[1:56:20] body if you if you've got it flaunted
[1:56:22] all that nonsense
[1:56:23] but that's not the way there's a way you
[1:56:26] do it and god says do it this way but it
[1:56:27] just can make me look a bit funny but
[1:56:30] then look funny
[1:56:32] they look funny make me look a bit
[1:56:33] unpopular make me stand out then stand
[1:56:35] out
[1:56:37] what's in it for me probably nothing
[1:56:39] but there doesn't always have to be
[1:56:40] something in it for you because that's
[1:56:42] not how this thing works
[1:56:44] sometimes there's things in it for god
[1:56:46] not you
[1:56:47] he says i want you presented that way
[1:56:48] now just clean up your act and look that
[1:56:50] way
[1:56:52] okay
[1:56:53] and you take it you're going to get
[1:56:54] opposition
[1:56:55] to doing all of this you're going to get
[1:56:57] opposition to doing it
[1:56:58] okay
[1:57:00] the way you conduct yourself you know
[1:57:01] like oh i got to have social drink stop
[1:57:03] it
[1:57:04] or you know i'm chasing after all this
[1:57:06] money or my are you is your conduct your
[1:57:08] dealings with people day-to-day stuff is
[1:57:10] it is it good is it honorable do they
[1:57:12] walk away feeling good
[1:57:14] or do you do people walk away feeling
[1:57:16] bad
[1:57:17] what's your conduct like with them you
[1:57:18] know
[1:57:19] this is all part of the land it's not
[1:57:21] just all the good stuff it's all this is
[1:57:23] all part of it
[1:57:24] like at your work how do you conduct
[1:57:26] yourself do do people
[1:57:28] are people happy to have you around are
[1:57:29] they like no i don't like having that
[1:57:30] person around they're just always
[1:57:32] negative or this or that how's your
[1:57:34] conduct
[1:57:35] you know people this is why people want
[1:57:37] to be popular
[1:57:38] god says no there's no popularity here
[1:57:40] you're probably going to be made fun of
[1:57:43] unless young people struggle with this
[1:57:45] you know because if you make a second if
[1:57:46] you because god calls you to this you
[1:57:48] know lord i want to be popular you know
[1:57:49] suddenly got to dress up this snack like
[1:57:51] this but no one's gonna like me
[1:57:53] well god will amen
[1:57:56] but this is something now
[1:57:58] all the old people
[1:58:00] shouldn't say oh but all the older
[1:58:01] people say amen because you get to a
[1:58:03] stage where you realize i'm not cool
[1:58:04] anyway you know who cares you know
[1:58:07] i think it's when you have children you
[1:58:09] you they suddenly you suddenly realize
[1:58:10] man i'm like on the out crowd now like
[1:58:14] when did we transition you should give
[1:58:15] me some warning
[1:58:18] suddenly i'm old i've got children that
[1:58:19] that are making fun of me about come on
[1:58:21] dad you know maybe did i get old
[1:58:23] you know i'm cooler than you anne
[1:58:28] you know
[1:58:29] young people battle with this one maybe
[1:58:31] more than older people it's like the way
[1:58:32] that young people dress now
[1:58:35] you know they when you get old and
[1:58:36] married you're like yeah you know
[1:58:38] it all just gets lazy you know just you
[1:58:40] put this way people walk in town in
[1:58:42] their pajamas you know but i guarantee
[1:58:44] when they were
[1:58:45] maybe if they were meeting their
[1:58:46] potential marriage partner for the first
[1:58:49] time they wouldn't roll into town in
[1:58:50] their pyjamas
[1:58:51] you know but
[1:58:54] but
[1:58:55] young people will battle with some of
[1:58:56] these things more than older people but
[1:58:58] still is a battle that everyone has to
[1:59:00] to take right and to fight this is one
[1:59:02] you know you could even get even with
[1:59:04] that guy that girl you know
[1:59:07] the the the word of god says why don't
[1:59:09] you just suffer wrong he did me wrong
[1:59:14] now it's not just oh if you and the
[1:59:17] peter said it's not just if he said if
[1:59:19] you were wrong if you did something
[1:59:21] wrong and then i came to little never
[1:59:22] set up the front bro
[1:59:25] mikey did something i did something
[1:59:27] wrong to mikey you know i walked past
[1:59:29] him and i booted his leg you know i was
[1:59:31] clearly wrong and then ben said i saw
[1:59:32] you do that to mikey you were wrong i'm
[1:59:34] like yeah sorry mikey you know
[1:59:39] but
[1:59:40] if i was wrong i can easily go oh yeah
[1:59:42] but
[1:59:43] but if i did nothing to mikey and ben
[1:59:44] said oh you did this to mikey and i said
[1:59:46] no i did nothing
[1:59:48] and he told you oh my you told me did
[1:59:49] you tell him i did something to you
[1:59:52] the bible says that even if
[1:59:54] you weren't wrong if you were completely
[1:59:56] right just still take it don't worry
[1:59:57] about it don't get even don't worry
[1:59:58] about it just take it he said why don't
[2:00:00] you rather suffer wrong
[2:00:02] or you get you get done over in some
[2:00:05] deal just take it
[2:00:07] i'll show them i'm gonna i'm gonna make
[2:00:09] this deal right i'm gonna
[2:00:12] god says why don't you just take it
[2:00:14] especially if it's brethren just take it
[2:00:16] take the loss all good
[2:00:18] and don't even tell them it's all good
[2:00:19] yeah no great deal
[2:00:21] awesome
[2:00:22] you lost everything yeah awesome
[2:00:26] i'm just pointing it out this part of
[2:00:28] the land you know you're something we're
[2:00:30] not called to get even we're called just
[2:00:31] to yeah
[2:00:33] now that that might be hard for us to
[2:00:34] take as well so everything's going to be
[2:00:35] fair down the line
[2:00:38] no it doesn't
[2:00:39] it wasn't fair with god they hated me
[2:00:41] without a cause then he came and died
[2:00:42] for us and he didn't even commit
[2:00:44] how's that fear yeah
[2:00:46] that's not fair but he did it anyway
[2:00:49] you understand
[2:00:52] i just want to point out there are
[2:00:52] things in there that we don't know but
[2:00:54] you start doing that you realize man the
[2:00:55] lord just looks after me vince is mine
[2:00:57] i'll repay says the lord i can i just
[2:01:00] don't have to worry about stuff people
[2:01:01] can walk all over me everything turns
[2:01:03] out all right for me doesn't matter you
[2:01:05] realize that's what's what's in the land
[2:01:06] they can you can get done over a million
[2:01:08] times and still come out far better off
[2:01:10] why because if you're just committed to
[2:01:12] god
[2:01:13] when you put your hands on something god
[2:01:14] can't deal with it if you just commit it
[2:01:15] to god saying that's all good and i'm
[2:01:16] happy yeah often times you come out
[2:01:18] better off you know we don't always have
[2:01:20] to get in there
[2:01:22] pride you know who
[2:01:24] no one here is proud look at what i've
[2:01:26] done
[2:01:27] but this is something you that's it's
[2:01:29] out this this whole attitude me i'm
[2:01:31] pretty good even when you're sitting
[2:01:33] down in your room by yourself you don't
[2:01:35] think this i'm pretty good
[2:01:37] no no
[2:01:39] we we're humble with the brothers there
[2:01:40] brother oh no praise the lord he really
[2:01:42] helped me
[2:01:43] when you get home you're like man i'm
[2:01:44] pretty good
[2:01:46] you know
[2:01:48] god sees that too
[2:01:51] hey
[2:01:52] but this is part of the land
[2:01:54] the lord knows
[2:01:56] i look at my life and i think lord the
[2:01:58] only decent stuff i've ever done is i've
[2:02:00] committed it to you
[2:02:01] it's all i've done decently and that's
[2:02:04] it and and i didn't even do that i'm
[2:02:06] like man this is something
[2:02:07] i didn't even you called me first so i
[2:02:09] didn't even
[2:02:10] that you put a desire me to do this even
[2:02:11] the one thing that i kind of did right
[2:02:14] you put that desire on me to do it i'm
[2:02:15] like okay well that's it then and all
[2:02:18] that all that i have everything is
[2:02:19] because of your blessing lord and it's
[2:02:20] nothing that i've done i haven't i'm not
[2:02:22] smart haven't figured things out and
[2:02:24] haven't got there's nothing lord i've
[2:02:25] just
[2:02:26] i've just given you my loaves and fish
[2:02:28] that's it
[2:02:30] and that's that's our attitude that's
[2:02:32] you know walk around like like brother
[2:02:34] branham said of that
[2:02:35] that preacher that walked up to the
[2:02:36] purple proud you know and then he tried
[2:02:38] to preach it didn't quite work out then
[2:02:40] he walked down all sort of humble
[2:02:42] walked up like this you know and walked
[2:02:43] down like that
[2:02:44] and the
[2:02:46] old sister said you know if he had
[2:02:48] walked up the way he walked down he
[2:02:50] would have walked down the way he walked
[2:02:52] up
[2:02:52] [Laughter]
[2:02:55] this is blue because this could go
[2:02:56] either way talents you know most some
[2:02:58] people have to give their talent some
[2:02:59] people aren't just like
[2:03:00] but you've but part of being in the land
[2:03:01] you've got to give what you've got to
[2:03:03] the lord
[2:03:04] have to it's not optional i don't know
[2:03:06] no you have to
[2:03:07] have to
[2:03:08] you've got to
[2:03:10] whatever you can do you've got to give
[2:03:12] that talent to the lord he wants to see
[2:03:14] a return he's very clear on that where's
[2:03:17] my return on my investment
[2:03:19] i invested that into you where is my
[2:03:21] return
[2:03:23] oh no i hit it in the ground i didn't do
[2:03:25] anything with it well then you're wrong
[2:03:26] take it from cast them out
[2:03:28] no i want to return
[2:03:32] and they people even they even say well
[2:03:33] you're a hard man he's like no i just
[2:03:35] i gave the ability to do it you could
[2:03:37] have gone dealt with it and brought some
[2:03:40] you should i wanted my talent back with
[2:03:41] interest
[2:03:43] that's in the land
[2:03:45] it's not optional you've got to do it
[2:03:47] got any talents you've got to give them
[2:03:48] to the lord
[2:03:50] uh you've got time who has spare time
[2:03:56] i shouldn't have said that because i'm
[2:03:57] going to now twist it around
[2:04:00] and then and then we're just in closing
[2:04:02] i've got about five more minutes
[2:04:04] uh okay in order to have something just
[2:04:06] for the people that don't know my theory
[2:04:08] on time where if you to have something
[2:04:11] spare you've got to know two things how
[2:04:13] much have you got and how much do you
[2:04:15] need like if uh
[2:04:16] if we needed three microphones here
[2:04:18] because we knew say we got three people
[2:04:20] speaking okay
[2:04:22] how many microphones have we got 10 how
[2:04:24] many people are speaking three
[2:04:26] so how many have got spare
[2:04:28] seven
[2:04:29] so because you know these two equations
[2:04:31] right so you look at people say well
[2:04:33] i've got some spare time today so no you
[2:04:34] don't have any spare time ever in your
[2:04:36] entire existence yeah i do no no how
[2:04:39] much time have you got
[2:04:42] i don't know no no what how much time
[2:04:44] have you got left
[2:04:46] i could drop dead now
[2:04:48] my time's up how much time have i got
[2:04:49] left
[2:04:50] i really don't know how much of it do
[2:04:52] you need
[2:04:54] all of it
[2:04:55] so how much have you got spare not a
[2:04:57] single second
[2:04:59] i allocate time
[2:05:01] i don't i don't have spare time it's all
[2:05:03] allocated now if i want to allocate time
[2:05:05] to sit down do nothing then that's where
[2:05:06] i allocate it to what are you going to
[2:05:07] do this afternoon nothing i'm allocating
[2:05:10] my time to do nothing but god has called
[2:05:12] us to a certain degree allocate your
[2:05:14] time wisely
[2:05:15] allocate it you've only got you don't
[2:05:17] know how much you've got
[2:05:19] allocate allocated
[2:05:19] certain portion you've got to balance it
[2:05:21] out you know you've got family this and
[2:05:22] that and hobbies and things but make
[2:05:24] sure you allocate it correctly
[2:05:26] balance it out and make sure i get a
[2:05:27] decent share of your time
[2:05:29] if you find something else is robbing
[2:05:31] you deal with it i need a decent share
[2:05:34] god wants a decent share he doesn't want
[2:05:36] to have par he's not we're not part-time
[2:05:38] full-time
[2:05:40] service we're called to serve god and as
[2:05:42] he sets up fellowships and groups and
[2:05:44] places and he expects each person to
[2:05:46] figure out where that is where i've put
[2:05:48] you in served there do things there
[2:05:50] whether it be this or that or that he
[2:05:51] expects that from us it's not like oh by
[2:05:53] the way if you feel like it maybe go and
[2:05:55] serve you it's not optional you have to
[2:05:58] that's part of the land oh i don't serve
[2:05:59] them
[2:06:02] everything like this see all these
[2:06:03] things you're getting it fought with you
[2:06:05] know they're not going to come easy but
[2:06:07] they're all part of the land
[2:06:09] but just in closing
[2:06:11] mark my words this land that we're in
[2:06:13] it's land flowing with milk and honey
[2:06:16] it's a good land
[2:06:17] every bit of land that you claim you
[2:06:19] realize there's something better there
[2:06:20] afterwards even if you didn't know
[2:06:22] there's always when you get rid of that
[2:06:23] thing there there's always something far
[2:06:25] better than what was there
[2:06:26] it's like man i used to get angry and
[2:06:28] i'm so happy now i don't get angry
[2:06:29] anymore i'm just so patient it's so much
[2:06:31] more enjoyable
[2:06:32] or at least the gossip now i can just
[2:06:33] speak about the lord or whatever things
[2:06:35] you might when you get rid of something
[2:06:37] that the wrong thing the the right thing
[2:06:39] is always so much better i've always
[2:06:40] liked the concept of milk and honey
[2:06:42] because it's such a good barometer of a
[2:06:44] land you know there's the there's two
[2:06:46] things that come from a land if you have
[2:06:48] a lot of honey it means you've got a lot
[2:06:50] of bees if you've got a lot of bees it
[2:06:52] means you've got a lot of fruit a lot of
[2:06:53] life everything's growing
[2:06:55] and the more fruit trees the more
[2:06:58] like you have clover from the spring
[2:07:00] you've got the grass grows has all the
[2:07:02] flowers and everything and the bees are
[2:07:03] just buzzing all over it the more of
[2:07:05] that you have the more honey you get so
[2:07:06] if god says it's flowing with honey it
[2:07:08] means there's a lot of life there
[2:07:10] there's fruit trees there's this and
[2:07:12] that this place is just the honey is
[2:07:13] just the honey is an end result of all
[2:07:15] this action there's millions of bees out
[2:07:17] there gathering and on all these fruit
[2:07:18] trees this is what this land is like
[2:07:21] it's just flowing with good things
[2:07:23] milk is the same you have milk because
[2:07:25] you have little babies you have babies
[2:07:27] because you have a lot of life and
[2:07:28] things are reproducing it's happening
[2:07:30] it's life
[2:07:31] that's what we are in that's what this
[2:07:33] land is it's flowing with milk and honey
[2:07:35] it's not a
[2:07:36] even though there are some things that
[2:07:37] are that appear hard they're not you you
[2:07:41] never take a bit of land and look back
[2:07:42] over at the border and say oh man i wish
[2:07:44] i was over back over there mark my words
[2:07:46] will never do that you think man i'm so
[2:07:48] happy in this land it's so good
[2:07:50] i'm taking a whole lot i'm so you i
[2:07:51] every every bit of land i take it's just
[2:07:53] always even if i don't understand it it
[2:07:55] always works out good there's always
[2:07:56] something better there so on that basis
[2:07:58] i'm going to take everything else
[2:08:00] oh that's my there's eternal life in the
[2:08:02] land there's forgiveness in the land
[2:08:04] there's all these awesome things even
[2:08:05] that's god's going to
[2:08:07] satan's gonna draw no maybe it's not for
[2:08:08] united
[2:08:10] there's a body change in the land
[2:08:12] there's there's yes
[2:08:14] you know joseph um
[2:08:17] jacob when he was in egypt he said don't
[2:08:19] don't bury me here when i die bring me
[2:08:21] back to that land because he knew there
[2:08:23] was a resurrection there
[2:08:25] there's not a resurrection here there's
[2:08:26] not a body change over here there's a
[2:08:27] body change here though in this land
[2:08:29] there's a body change you know there's
[2:08:31] it's a it's a good land it's flying with
