you everyone I mean it's good to everyone here this morning let's go to let's go the book of Hebrews we're gonna go to chapter 12 Hebrews Hebrews 12 and verse 18 C is here for we and not come so I see ones dear I just want to save in the beginning the Lord has everything in control we do not need to worry let's just have faith let's just believe but I'll get all stressed and worried he father's got all in control for we are not come unto the mount that might be touched that burnt with fire nor unto the blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded as if so much as a beast touch the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and which of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel I mean unless just turn to another scriptures go to the book of Job and we're going to go to job 3 and 25 and Jobe says here for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of has come unto me may the lordly bless his word this morning you may have your seats and the presence of the Lord I'd like to take a just just take a thought from from Hebrews chapter 12 about how the blood of the Lamb speaks bear things than that of Abel now we are living in a in a tremendous time where the Apostle Paul said that we have not come to Mount Zion we've not come to the law where God has separated from from man you know they could not you know they see at boundaries around the bottom of the mountain that you know no one could approach it or well you know come near it but there was a distance between God and man and the Old Testament because of sin but you know now now in the yo under the blood of Jesus Christ yeah I'm just gonna go a bit slow this morning but just just just be it with me I'm just trying to stay on my feet but you know under the blood of Jesus Christ you know we are not come to a place of separation between us and God but you know as as it was death in the Old Testament for people to go into the Holy of Holies into the prints of God you know only the high priests of God once a year anointed dressed a certain way with the blood you know it was death for anyone else to go in but now it's death not to go into the prints of God it's just become the opposite now where it's death to stay away but it's life to go into his presence so we have come to eat we have come to a place where where the churches has you know we have not come to Mount Zion but we've come to the new jersey I mean so we have not come to Mount Sinai but we've come to Mount Zion to the city of the Living God amen and to and so now the let's just go to as well let's go to the book of Deuteronomy and in chapter 16 because I want to if I could impart something to us today I just want to say this that we are the the believer that's been called into his presence and not just not just you know the scribes and Pharisees were in the prints of God but those who have come under the blood they've come under the word they've met him they've become one with him there we should be the most happiest people in all the world all the pressures should be let off you know brother Brown preach the sermon letting off the pressure the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into and a safe that all the pressures of life can be let go I mean because we ran our haven of rest we don't need to worry whatever situation comes our way what trials we may be facing I mean but we are in a place of safety now the Lord has dictated in his word that there's specific places to worship Him and we read here in Deuteronomy 16 where it says in Deuteronomy 16 and 1 it says observe the law of evidence re the month of a bird and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God from the month of Abbott the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover and the LORD thy God of the flock and the herd and in the place which the Lord has chosen to place his name so notice God's plate giving a specific instruction here thou shall eat no leavened bread with it seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread there worth even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou mayest remember the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all biko seven days neither shall there there anything of the flesh which they are sacrifices the first eight even remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrificed the Passover within any of thy gates which the Lord giveth thee but where he's come out he but he commands him that that the place where he puts his name that gate is where you should worship the Lord and sacrifice so God is saying as now we know the Old Testament as a shadow of the new so when we NEET so so here in the Old Testament we know God to speak of a geographical location but God is still given an instruction you just don't worship anywhere and in any gate that you have made any place you have made but in God's provided places where you should worship so where he has places named that's where the believer worship so we want to we want to find that place we want to worship there and because of it worship there then our worship is accepted because we ultimately we want to be accepted by God right Amen so we want to worship at a place where we are accepted Amen so now you know because in the Bible there's this worship that's accepted a worships rejected Cain's worship was rejected Abel's was accepted right so we want to be accepted like Abel was okay so now so so he's saying that you just can't worship God anywhere with a place but but it's where God has chosen to place his name that's where we worship God now we know Jesus when he came he says I come and my father's name and you received me not so the name of of of God is Jesus right because the name of Jesus means Jehovah salvation says the full manifestation of God salvation was manifested in the man Jesus Christ so God put his name in his son Jesus Christ and we know that he is the word right in the beginning John 1 and 1 was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us so where God has put his name as in his word right so if you're worshiping God according to the revelation of his word you're worshiping and God's providing place of worship in Christ if you're worshiping a man-made Creed you're not in God's provide a place of worship but if you are worshiping God under the anointed word of your day according to the revelation of it then you're worshiping God's provide a place you're worshiping where God has placed his name hallelujah they mean so now that's where we want to be worshiping so brother Branham would say he sees us in things that are to be and there shall be no leavened bread oh sorry how much more able he's able to get he's a creator now think how he's able to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there's something in us Khalsa live and there are something in us that calls to do right then God will give somebody on the platform or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone to prepare you've got to be a real word Bride of Christ amen as the bridegroom as the word so the bride will be the word I was preaching a few nights ago on the sacrifice in the days of atonement I was preaching on the only place of God the only church that God will ever meet a man and and that is he said the place that he put his name he said I won't meet them in any other place but the place the gate that I put my name in now he doesn't meet you in the method escape the Baptist's gate the Pentecostal gate or any of them but he put his name in his son he said I come in my father's name any man comes or child comes in his father's name I come in the name of a Brandon because my father was a Branham and you come in your name because that's your father's name and Jesus the son came in his father's name he said he put his name in this gate that I put my name and that was the sacrifice and in Jesus Christ is the only place you'll ever find fellowship and worship to God hallelujah so that's how vital it is now in order for you know we understand well as we read in in Hebrews chapter 12 that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things than that of Abel 'he's blood now in the book of Genesis we were and read it but but you read in your own Genesis where yo yo Genesis chapter 4 Abel brought her sacrifice Cain brought her sacrifice Cain was rejected because he was he was bringing the labors of his hands but Abel had a revelation it was blood in the garden so he brought a lamb amen and then and then Abel's sacrifice was accepted and then Cain was rejected and he and you know and God went and spoke Tom said well why don't you just do like your brother did and you'll be accepted because God gives everyone a choice right that you know that tries to come to him about God gives you about an opportunity but then it's up to us to respond to what he commands us to do if we'll if well humble ourselves to his word I mean then we we will actually accept what he wants to give us and so now and then so he was yours Carthoris was fallen he was angry when it talked with his brother Abel he killed him and then God comes to Cain and says the the voice of your the blood of your brother cries out to me Amen but now I okay I'm sorry Abel though he was under the blood of that lamb and God accepted his sacrifice his blood couldn't help his brother his blood couldn't help Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't just cry out but it redeems amen he says in the token see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real revelation he had he spoke it cried out the justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed it speaketh better things it makes you sons and daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain see but the blood of Jesus can Amen so all Cain come out today if you're a persecutor against the word and say days of miracles as past the thing is all nonsense and things it's crying out see the blood of Jesus Christ cries out but there is forgiveness in it if you just accept it wish we could stay a little while and they see the blood speaketh better things now we can't get to heaven on our own ability now this is probably probably a simple thought this morning but I just want us to appreciate more what we have right because if you really appreciate if you know is what's been revealed to you what you have you'll be resting the Christian life is based on rest and has finished work right it says in the book of Hebrews where there's a confirmation of an oath then you cease from all strife so when Abraham when God confirmed to him by Nokia's gonna give him the promised son then he could rest knowing that God will give him Isaac doesn't matter how long you know you know what but God had to do it and God brings us into a walk where we come to a point where we know it's impossible for it to come to pass and God wants it that way because of because if we think that we put ourselves into it and we had anything to do with it and our pride will be lifted up and who receives the glory not God and God will not receive share his glory with any person doesn't matter their background where they're from how good they think they are God will not share his glory with no man or woman right so that's why he gets us into places where we know it can only be God that we are still standing and can only be God we've been provided for it's only God that we're still walking this narrow way amen it's only God and this is why he'll be with the rapture we will come to recognize a ssin it was only him that transformed this body it was only him that we have faith in this day it was only him that we were stood the enemy in this hour amen and God wants us that way because if Abraham was the father of faith his children will be in the same manner because children take on the manner of the parent right so Abraham had a walk where it came to a place where it was literally absolutely beyond a shadow impossible they couldn't do it amen and even in God's permissive will gossin I don't want your permissive will take hey go anyway but that's not how it's going to be right and so if so if Abraham had that walk of faith so will the children of faith in this hour hallelujah amen but yes oh so that's why that's why we have to come to such a yeah and and you may may already have it in your soul but I won't anchor a little bit more it's only by being closed in the blood of Jesus Christ by the wedding garment whatever you want to call it it's only being his blood covering you that he doesn't see you no more amen and and and I'm going to read a quote to you later on but the thing is we worry about our humanity too much now I'm not giving excuse for sin but we look at our own own self because man wants to do man wants to put us effort in you know and in a way we should but in a way it's not our ability right grace grace and the New Testament is the divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection on the life that's the definition of New Testament grace so our ability is actually His divine influence upon our hearts and then the ability that we do is actually it just reflecting in our lives hallelujah amen so now so we have to come to that place where it's not us at all it's him and that's how you get true humility when you know it's him in spite of you he comes and lives and you can look back and say Lord that was you how I was in that situation that was you how I responded that person that was you that wasn't me that wasn't my first nature Lord you know I wasn't born like that you've changed something in me and that was you responding to the enemy or you responding to that spirit man where I talk about the enemy I'm not never talking about a person right now we do not fight flesh and blood this battle is not a flesh and blood affair that's against demon power spiritual wickedness in high places okay amen you know brother bramma yeah I don't have the quote but but okay I might get this wrong but I think he said to someone when he goes to face those three hunt you that Ministerial Association in Chicago and they're trying to trap him about what he believed I think he said to the brother who went with him now what's God mighty in battle and you see how and and and and that was recorded how he spoke to them he doesn't come across all aggressive speaks to them nicely you know and God took control of the whole situation he said the prophecy there was God mighty in battle I mean Jesus came and it showed it's not how man fights war is the wrong way how man fights is wrong but he showed how real man fights through humility and sweetness and being yield to the Spirit of God he conquered everything that could be conquered I mean by submitting himself to the wood allotted to him hallelujah and he's our example I mean so if he can do it we can't buy his first Amen we can absolutely do it huh that's why I'm glad you know that's not like or cannot be done it's already been done and he says children walk in my footsteps and do the same hallelujah he enables us to do so so now if we are if the blood has been applied his spirit is in you you should be the happiest person in all the world because what happens is the devil comes against us we get sick or or your mind battle comes in sometimes battles can rage for a while they meant some battles you know it medieval time between the French and English is a hundred year war it's a long time to fight right but sometimes the devil can be it can be a mom Bell but then what happens is we get sick or the devil comes and tries to attack our spirit and then what's the first thing that starts to erode away in us where am I really a believer right but the devil can brother Bram said you a person can be filled with the Holy Ghost and go insane because the Holy Ghost comes into the soul right we are sealed our souls are sealed to the day of our Redemption but then there's still the spirit realm and the body with the devil cannot get your soul he cannot get your soul he can attack you in your body or in your spirit but he can't break that seal on your soul he cannot rob that seat of election from you I mean he cannot change and he cannot alter it it's gonna stay there hallelujah we have that confidence I mean the devil cannot get your soul and that's what God is coming for hallelujah so the devil comes and he makes us sick here you're here flicks us in our minds and then we begin to walk back oh we really believe us yes we believe it I mean you got to stand there flat-footed doesn't matter what's going on in this thing hallelujah you can be turned up who's been I've been I've had a lot of moments in here I don't know which way is up or down left or right I don't even know what's going on half the time that doesn't mean I'm not a believer because eventually remember faith worketh patience I mean so so if you've got faith that will work patience that you'll know and God's timing he will deliver he will come on the battlefield he will conquer the enemy I mean so we have to just stand there saying it doesn't matter member we're not saved because we think we're safe we're saying because we believe it that's the main thing because we believe it in here that's why we're saved hallelujah you know I'm glad I'm not throwing mud on anyone but the poor Jehovah's Witnesses they believe if they forget about Jehovah they're not saved any more so if they get a yo dementia they're lost that's sad there's no rest in that kind of religion we don't have that kind of religion hallelujah cuz this thing could go but if I'm sealed here I'm going hallelujah and that's the main thing ami sorry about so if we have now we know in this day and age we can't literally get the blood of Jesus Christ because it's gone right we can't go to Jerusalem it's not preserved in here but the life that was in their blood so when Jesus died remember in the Old Testament the lamb lamb was brought by the worshiper the lamb was examined not the worshipper the worshiper wasn't even brought into account it was the lamb amen and then once the priest examined the lamb and found to be perfect then what happened then the lamb was offered and that worst record go home justified right because the lamb was accepted amen and it's the same thing with us now it's not so but then what happened was the the desire for yo that caused that worshipper to fall under sin after he gave the lamp he still had that desire because the animal life for that land will ball or whatever couldn't come and change him cuts animal life but then under but then with the blood of Jesus Christ when he died because we weren't there rival who who physically stood there on Mount Tam crucifixion and saw him die no that's 2000 years ago we were in their right but the blood was given and the life was released out of that blood and those who have truly put their accepted him as their sin sacrifice put their hands on his head accepted that he died in your place then the life that was released out of his blood comes into you right so the sin nature that you were born with is gone I mean this is not sin management this is sin eradication I mean the blood of Jesus preached Christ eradicate sin thanks away the nature of sin hallelujah that's not sin man it's not coping seven steps to cope with your sin let's know once they have to deal with it hallelujah that's how it is so so it changes us and I can say that because I've had the experience oh yeah glory to God I may not tell you well I don't want to tell you those things of God but anyway so the life comes into us the Holy Ghost was the life of God that was released out of the blood comes into you and it makes you a Christian now he says in the token 1964 the voice of the blood of abel cried out against Cain we find out Hebrews 12 24 the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speak as the life that's in the blood that does the speaking the soul that was in Cain neck I mean or enable it was the life that was in Christ that cries out bear things in any it speaks and it speaks loud it's the Holy Ghost that speaks plain it tells us that the time is here when we see it where it said that would say it and then we see it come back and identify what it said see there is nothing else left but to believe it that's right to receive it so he says it's the life that's the life of the blood comes into you how lujah and then so now he said in brother branham oh so I'll say this now so now it's our life see the blood speaks better thing so it's his life and you speaking better things I mean that's makes bitter things in your old life that's for sure amen now when God sees us when God sees a Christian covered in the blood he doesn't see the person that's us saying before we we wrestle with this guy too much but God doesn't see this guy right if you're under the blood God doesn't see you are you're following me I trust this is a bit liberating for some because we beat ourselves up a lot right we do don't we we beat ourselves down and it's just the devil taking your good intentions and beating you up with it amen but we're not called to you know but but that's not that's not our you know what do you call that's not our inheritance right we're not called to be beaten up by our own good intentions but when God sees us he doesn't see you he sees the blood of his own son now bro Abraham he has a interview with a sister Bruce now I'm just gonna read this now what hell I don't know who said it but you know someone said it this morning God and simplicity we we we make God too complicated right because the human mind needs something great but God is so great and he was shown as greatness by becoming so simple and then what happens is because God actually became so simple and we're trying to make something so great we actually stumble over what he's done and then we're trying to attain to something that we already have in many cases so we try to chase this carrot that's being dangled somewhere when actually no you already have the promise right but it's but it's always the human mind that we have not obtained right and we know that there's the fullness of adoption the change of the body but the blood of Jesus Christ makes us perfect sure we've got to mature but you look at you know you look at your when you you know the Lord Jesus spoke about the harvest you go so some wheat in the field you don't have to go tell that week every day now grow and grow and this and and and if the we could speak back you know it doesn't get up before wool but you're ever ever have a have a quick meeting before the Sun comes up now boys we've got to grow today come on you know just like sheep they don't say now okay we're gonna be in wool and we're gonna try harder they just walk around and eat grass there's a life and them that that produces wool they don't put pressure on themselves they just be sheep they walk around and eat cheap food and it produces wool right and it's the same thing with the believer if you are eating cheap food right if you're feeding on sheep food at will with the right spirit produce the fruits of the Spirit in your life that will produce a life of Christ in you amen so you know but you don't see sheep you know being all stressed okay we're going to grow this much wool in this day are we on target no we're not know that they just walk around and be sheep right and it's the same thing with us we put so much pressure on ourselves if there's a life in here right and you're not walking you're walking after the spirit or not after the flesh right it will produce itself it has to it's a life amen so now he says here I'm fixing to pray for you speak about sister Bruce I'm not worthy of that I think what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here I mean what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you and with his great fancy you'd get well he says well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you we've got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not sinners no more we are Christian he says I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman amen and so he's saying now he says God doesn't see us we see us too much we see us God doesn't say if you're really under the blood not just not just professing it or not and in the life of God not in you and you're not just associating with it but if you really came under the word really become one with him amen then he doesn't see you you mean this guy this thing we wrestle with so much no God doesn't see you he sees the blood hallelujah does should that make you happy because we look ourselves in the mirror we get frustrated who do we get fresh we don't give well I trust you don't get frustrated with God all right we are frustrated with this guy and we beat ourselves up and sure we should be sincere we should be you know looking for your we shouldn't just like lay back and whoa if God will do it he'll do it no that's unbelief speaking because faith goes and possesses the promise right but you know we shouldn't just what are you looking at I'm looking at him now but then but then sister Bruce is but I make so many mistakes I fail so many times then brother Brown says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lot of TV see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve Him who has that desire in their heart this morning that deep down the desire my heartis to serve Him see your mistakes are not a lot of to see he is your propitiation see he is your sin offering your sins are not knowing you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins became you because your desire is to serve Him Amen sister Bruce is but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on and then brother brown replies alright now notice us ordinarily a human being is born and soon shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being right that was your nature it changed once but what changed it and she says Christ and he says there it is sister see that's it seekers her desire was to serve the Lord not to serve a religion but to reserve the living word is the big difference between a religion and and and and actually being a Christian right we're not here to serve a church we're here to serve the Living Word Jesus Christ I mean this is not about this I don't you know we yeah we put a name on the front of the place because you got to have a name but doesn't mean anything really it's the word here that's that's important alright people becoming one with him right so because her heart was that she wanted to serve Him that's why he died for her that she could serve Him amen and that's and that's why he died for us that we could serve Him amen because now and and the reason that we want to sue is because his unmerited grace has been imparted to you hallelujah amen is this is enjoy a James four and six but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble that's why it's so important Lord I'm nothing now that doesn't mean you're a sinner when you say you're nothing you say Lord I can't do it you have to come and do it I can't live this Christian life you need to come and him and he gives you his grace imparted so that you can do it so so he has her now you had the nature of a human being born in sin shaped iniquity comes to world speaking lies you had that one time but it changed there what did it Christ and he's saying that's when you actually received the Holy Ghost when your heart was turned that all your world news actually says the Living God hallelujah but that's too simple for us sometimes we're looking for something big now we know God is not a cookie cutter so we'll have all have a different testimony but at the end of the day what should be the resolve that testimonies that I Lord your word I want to become one with your word whatever you want me to do because I love you I want to do it and return not that I will earn anything but because I want to serve me because I love you remember the whole Christian walks to be motivated by love I mean not by what you can get and not by being a man please the people will think you're something amen whoo we try to please right who's they who's the jury that gets us into heaven you know who that's the Lord you know it's not a panel of your peers and say you're worthy now he made us worthy by his blood hallelujah amen so so the Amen so we want to we need to have that point in our lives amen and that's why you see people who are really sold out they've really given their all their whole life has revolved now around their Christian walk it's not a tack on it's not something well I'll just put this in because it feels good no you're the center of your life will be him brother Brahim said about the Apostle Paul is a christ-centered life and that's why I want to have a christ-centered life not just the thing we do on a Sunday or a Wednesday or because uh you know you want other people to think with me something no at christ-centered life as everything revolves around that where we live you know you know what I mean our lifestyles you built around the word not not not the word built around our lifestyle amen you'll find it'll pay off one day I'll Lou you win these adders with change I don't yeah I probably won't say I don't know I'll probably lost words but I'll but the first thing I want to say is that was worth it and it paid off hallelujah paid the dividends that said it would hallelujah amen no he says and he says in the token he says it so now the blood of the covenant of Christ speaks better things than that of Abel see we find the blood does speak it speaks in your behalf the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood he says our brother I wish everyone could see that if we can see what it is it's the life that's in you see that the blood is identifying with with you it's the token the blood has been shed for you you're accepted and the life has come unto you you have the token that's the Holy Ghost amen that's why that's why if you're really sealed in doesn't matter what comes or goes let the devil house let Trials come let pre-tribulation time come let the world fall apart it's gonna fall apart the world is falling apart I mean even in the first world will now take knowledge you know I'll think this world is broken this world is this this country is broken amen I work in a drug testing lab drugs have destroyed this country and they will continue to destroy it the social fabric of this country's broken home life is broken every part of this country is broken and people have no answers but in the Lord we have the answer but this world has fallen apart hallelujah it has you know it's like this I won't do it but I saw a brother he took her he took a glass brother Richard do Co and he smashed it against the pulpit now it's falling apart he says the world has fallen apart like this glass turd and you think about it you can hold this much water in a in a whole glass but when it's broken all the pieces are disconnected maybe a little bit of water could be in a little bit of those pieces but it can't do what it used to do that's like this world it's broken it's all in pieces they're not connected this world has brought everything's just connected hey families are disconnected mum doesn't talk to dad dad doesn't talk to children children don't talk to each other bunch of individuals in a home what's fallen apart it's my brother Graham said about how what we should do is we should wear your the family altar should bring us together prayer should bring us together the word should bring us together that's what we should do amen I trust that's not alien birds of a feather flock together what kind of birds are we heavenly birds hallelujah maiden as image a family that prays together stays together amen because now if we have the token because at your as we you know brother Browns referring to in the Old Testament when the there was the Passover came when the Death Angel was going to strike Egypt you know the blood was a token to them that we're me when when when the angel sees the blood he'll pass over the house the death will not strike amen and we know that the token today is the holy ghost amen but if you're as saying you should you should make sure that you know him but if your heart has been turned that all you want to do is serve Him I say that's a good indication you've got it right that's a good indication because if all your affection everything you want sure we have a battle with this and we'll have a better with this until that's changed and we'll be very happy it's changed hallelujah it's not just teenagers have the battle middle-aged have the battle all the ones have the battle everyone in between has the battle because life isn't a constant change what we age we change situations change you know and the Devils try to get this try to get us off the path but that doesn't mean there's not a token on display I mean but we're going to keep this flesh as brothers eyes it was preach about the fight keep the sky subject to the Word of God amen so now so now if we have the token the Holy Ghost that means death could not strike us but we're safe hallelujah now Jobe I just want to go on to jobber because we read there from job 503 for the thing that I feared has overtaken me now brother Bram speaks very highly of Jobin as we should but I just want to point out before I go into what brother Brown speaks about him is that you see the thing that he feared happened to him so what did he fear he'd lose his children that died and everything he had would go because it happened to him but see he applied the blood he sacrificed on behalf of his family which is absolutely vital and he did but he was doing it all sake this is just me now in fellowship out of fear he was doing it out of fear he was trying to apply it he applied the blood out of fear cuz he didn't know what happened to the life hereafter right he was just you're following me so he was applying the blood he was being a believer out of fear but he was coming God's provider wasted God honored it but he was serving God out of fear because he himself did not know what happened to him when he died he didn't know where he was going he said a tree dies your comes back to life again flower nature you see death bill resurrection but and dice where does he go where does he go he didn't know he's honest it's good to be honest he didn't know and then so he was doing this out of fear but God accept it because those gods provided away so God allowed that whole trial to come upon him that now he wasn't that their God would take all the fear away isn't that a funny thing God would cause the hardest trial ever in his life to take his fear away yes and it's the same and and and I can see a few cogs turning thinking yeah that's happened to me too God allows us to go through the wringer to take fear away what's the fear of him joke was us he was afraid what's gonna happen to me he was he was standing on shifting saying because he didn't know you know he didn't know what happened in life hereafter he didn't look past the curtain of time right so he was he was worried and he applied the blood out of fear but then God allowed the trial and then after the trolly said now I know my Redeemer liveth and with these eyes I shall see him and I will stand with him amen on the earth hallelujah so then all the fear went because it went from well man dies where does he go this is now I know my redeemer lives and not just he you know but then I will stand with him on the earth I will see him with my eyes I'll see God so it took all the fear away hallelujah and God wants to take away all fear he wants he just was a so just build up confidence that we have confidence in him I mean that come what may we can just stand there say hallelujah Lord your control I'll praise you in the storm I'll give you glory in this trial hallelujah that's what he wants us to do he's applying it out of fear but yet in saying that that's he was still at least applying the blood on the behalf of his children and this is how we should be is that we should be applying the blood he said well how do you do that the faith you have for yourself you apply to them that's how you do it the same faith you have what you believe got saved whose believes in God saves there can be interactive time who believed in God saved that at work did your faith work did he change you did he transform you it wasn't someone else's God or someone else's testimony your testimony hallelujah will then use that same faith for them if it works for it'll work for them right hallelujah that's why you know little ones not well you've prayed for yourself focus on us they get healed you just apply the same faith to them don't you can you say Lord you filled this one you've done this when he hears well if you done that you'll do this you saved me you saved them Allu yeah you know that's pretty elementary it's very vital because we need to have confidence that's why we're gonna because brother Ray says apply the token and confidence not in or is it gonna work no yes it has to work it worked on me it'll work on me Allu yeah so now he sees here now God had confidence and job he fellowship with him he knew that job could I could trust him so he said alright Satan you go on he's at your hands but don't you take his life you can do anything else to him so Satan good at his office anything he I mean the way he goes and kills all the jobs children now I want you to know this a little thing Jobe had a a pre thought of it of that I believe did you notice when his children all them got away one day I mean I mean got together one day they had a great big banquet there is where you usually get in some trouble going to these big parties the office will throw a big blowout will go down on Christmas Eve as Billy Graham see in the paper the other day and get right good and drunk for your first time you have to Vint you have to let Vint for your soul you have you have been pinned up so long to you have to get out and let your soul go awhile just have to go out and have a good old time kind of release yourself on a vacation brother that shows you've never had fellowship with Christ of a man or a woman ever has had a real divine taste of fellowship with Christ I'd rather have have it than all the vacations and things in the world there's nothing wrong with a vacation I'm gonna throw that in there okay nothing wrong a vacation but what is your release because otherwise oh I'll wait for dick summer our summers gone it was a good day wasn't it and now we're looking for but then if you're always looking for the next one to enjoy yourself then you it's always in the future but if you have the Lord you can have you can have greater than a nice day in the Sun hallelujah it could be it could be foggy windy raining this way I just described most days here you know but that doesn't matter what does that matter have you ever got him you can rejoice hallelujah amen you know if the Apostle Paul could could could in the mammoth teen prison rejoice in his hardship rejoice I think we can yeah we've never had that kind of situation he went through a lot of things oh look and he just he just with it on hey hallelujah Amy I'm glad we can do the same no um yeah sure if you want to give me a relax let me feel Christ let me talk to him a little while and my burdens roll away it's all done I'd rather talk to him than anything I know in the world have fellowship with him so God doe that job had tasted David said taste and see the Lord is good just taste after him once and see that if he isn't good it tastes like honey in the rock now the great fellowship so Satan comes down but before he comes down job said now my children is out on a party tonight I wonder if we wouldn't have more fathers and mothers like job parents said my kids are out on a party tonight they're called and some of the worldly neighbors now perhaps they might sin oh my if mother's done and and father's more of us we wouldn't have any juvenile deliquency kids wouldn't be running in the streets like they RC said now pre adventure they might sin I'm going to offer an offering for each one that if anything does happen they'll have a blood shed way to come home bye oh my I'll offer it for them so here is for John I'll offer a sacrifice God for John now if he happens to stray off the path I mean off the road down here the Holy Spirit hasn't hasn't come to lead him so if he does stray off the road Lord I'll make up him a path here oh my Mary she is down here tonight so lord if she does stray I've raised her right but if she does stray I'll make her a path in this bloodshed way back God give us some more of those old mothers at nighttime praying for their kitties like that the backbone of any nation all right I'll make them a path hallelujah if job can do it we can do it right we have to have confidence in our weapon hallelujah amen oh if we had more fathers and mothers tonight so interested in their children that would offer the shed blood of the Lamb for their child every night at the throne of grace we wouldn't have so much carrying on as we have among young folks here pre adventure they might have sinned I don't know they have but to make sure his mother's you know it's a shame today and father's how uninterested we are in our children and when I read this I just kind of pissed me in here you're showing if we're really interested in them this is what we'll be doing it's not it's not new toys new clothes new whatever new gadgets gizmos whatever more no if we're really interested in them we can't buy our kids we can't buy them you know you can't just like you know the world tries to buy other nations to be friends it doesn't work you can't buy your children amen you can't do it with with your gifts and things but if we're really interested in them this is how it will be and the little juveniles you let the kids go out just as they please running all night long and everything and come in and seem to be so unconcerned about it let your girls go out with boys that smoke and drink and do and and go to gambling and dancing like come and then you say you're Christians and such stuff as that that's not right we should take them to the Lord because the Lord doesn't just take something away and then leave a void that is legalism right because you say oh that's wrong and you ain't but you know nothing fills the void what's it gonna do it just breed resentment right but if God is there to fill that void I mean and the children taste and see that the Lord is good you know I don't know who I know who I was talking about it with but you know I never oh yeah I think it's brother Isaac I don't miss a single day of drinking I never have since the day the Lord delivered me of it right I have never ever been addicted the day from that day till now I've never had that even the smallest inkling and I used to brew the stuff all kinds of things no inkling why because I tasted another spirit I partook of another spirit hallelujah and this one is glorious and it's priesthood and it brings satisfaction I've been stayin around drunk under it Julio and I just want more and the bottle never runs empty and there's no regrets hallelujah there's no regrets whatsoever but the reason I can rejoice is because the Lord filled the void right if I just hid oh well I've got to be a good boy and I've got to stop doing this honest I wouldn't what good were they done and then what I would have started judging others who are failing but all I've done is built up a wall but they still a desire here self-control can be such a curse cuz it especially under the guise of religion all it is is just well or they do that I don't do this but secretly and he is crying out for it you know you gotta let the Lord change let the Lord do the work let the Lord deliver and then it's not a fight anymore because it's well I don't want that anymore well why it's God oh you know but that's why you got a yeah that's why I believe we've got to share the reality of God not you know that's what because people want something real they don't just want a religion the world's full of it right but the reality when God come Changez a soul when God came to you change you transformed you speaks to you walks with you heals you delivers you whatever he's done for you those things are precious and you can't work it up you can't manufacture it that's God I mean that's why it's so powerful what comes out of this mouth I mean you can speak words and heaven comes down right you can or you can speak words and hell comes up hallelujah I don't want my life to be full of this lady I see in spirit of this world right I want to live in an atmosphere and we have what we need to produce it I mean that when we walk home I mean when we step into our homes we sit around the table sitting around the couch whatever talking what happens the atmosphere begins to change God comes down hallelujah I trust you know what I'm talking about because it's the atmosphere that doesn't what kind of atmosphere do you want in your house oh but we have everything just right according to the word know what atmosphere is there we want an atmosphere of divine grace to come in and when you talk about him he always comes near when you talk about him not about maybe sure we should share confess your faults one to another track your trouble but when you talk about him who's who's gonna solve your trouble is that you talking about it necessarily maybe that's when he comes because many times he doesn't change the situation he just changes our attitude hallelujah because God you know God doesn't prove her salvation by taking the devil away oh look I redeem them hallelujah and there's nothing and you never hunt down your life there's no proof of that it's when something is tested that's when you see what it's made of I mean you can have the nicest car or whatever you want you say can do this and do this and do this and do this and it hasn't even turned on in his life well how do you know it can it's just a piece of machinery but when you see it go through its cases then you can say what what what the designer said it would do it does and it's the same thing with our Lord he said what it does right but now it's got to be tested well how does has it tested you know you put on a test suit you put on the helmet you pick up the shield and the sword the breastplate everything what do you what's happening you're gonna jump in the vehicle amen now God's going to test it and you go through trials and hardship and things because gods want to see Satan it works Satan the blood works and not only to his enemy priests actually try to tell you see did you survive that did you survive did you oh forgot just survived but overcome when the enemy came in trying to get you off the path business come in and whatever more did you overcome it father do you still have the sweetness in your life of of the Lord still rejoicing yes what's the conclusion that worked and it will work there or work here work here work here working so he wants us to have confidence I had the devil's raging he will why is the devil howling because the headship has come to the body Christ and his bride has become one that's why the devil's howling he's hitting up her schemes everything going on it's because Christ and the bride have become one and then he wants to show you it works hallelujah God wants to prove himself you say well there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel what does his word say about it we don't I don't walk by these things Christian walk we walk by faith and not by sight faith in what you know faith in Him faith in the word Oh a means he sees we should take them to the Lord be waiting up for her to come in put your arms around her and say now sweetheart come here let's kneel down and pray mother doesn't know where you've been trusting you've been a good girl tonight but pre adventure you haven't let's offer the sacrifice of praise to God and give them thanks I'll tell you we'd have different children today they did that would have we we had more fathers like job see the trouble of those mothers today goth daughters out to such places and some things and some of them belongs at churches too and that's just a little bit hard but you know that's what does you good when it gets a little strong and stinking like that it's it's good for you so then job said now let's make sure of this I'm going to offer the sacrifice of the burnt lamb for each of my children whether they've sinned the only way I can present them is upon the basis of the shed blood that's god's only provided plan of redemption through the lamb so he offered it so I'm offering it so I said if mama gotten when the kids coming out on her way your Bimmer will get a kneel down and pray what's the purpose of the mother doing that that God would come down amen we should have we should be under expectation that when we talk to him he comes hallelujah and then when he comes everyone knows not that but the purpose members not that we would be exalted who cares about this thing who's the important one in this place him right hallelujah so that so that's the purpose of it is that God would come down Allu you and that's what we should be doing amen now I just finished so I just finished with this this is from what is the Holy Ghost he said they didn't have it in that day speaking of a circumcision under the law they just had to seal in their flesh as a token and as I am believing it was coming and they walked by the shadow of the law which they were circumcised by flesh today we don't walk by the shadow of the law we walk by the power of the Resurrection we walk by the power of the Spirit who is our true seal our true advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar odd people acting funny taking God at His Word calling everything else wrong God's Word is right oh my that's what the Holy Ghost is hallelujah now that's what we should do for instance we have a positive Tobias it's a positive token a positive token not a negative nada maybe positive a may have a possum gift of life it's a positive thing hallelujah it's real maybe a weekend rest in it we have a brother Brett yeah if you got the Holy Ghost in you the one who created the Sun Moon and stars is dwelling in huge that kind of power is in you but now he is the high priest of our profession right he will only act on your behalf when you call upon him to do so he will if you do not call upon him he can he is his hands are tied by your prayer amen so what should we do we should speak we should talk to him spent I said Lord this is my knee what are the two things that devil cuts because of the civilization we live in prayer right prayer listening and reading the word but where's our where's our lifeline prayer listening or reading to the word that's our lifeline and if we just really could fathom in our little minds the power that we have I mean the authority rather here is all the power we have the authority you got a badge of a believer just like a policeman he's got a policeman's badge the whole city's behind the policeman it could be a little bitty fellow but the whole you know police forces behind him we have the badge of believer he burns behind you heavens that God has never against us he's for us if God is for us who can be against us no not one that's for sure that's why we say well we have a positive token absolutely so we should applied in confidence that it makes the difference and any work any voices contrary to his word I would just ignore it I meant because we have a positive token hallelujah let's have the musicians please come we should apply it and fight not in fear but in faith I mean it worked for me it'll work for them hallelujah amen now my task brother Jeremy to come and help me because I still have a lot of frogs bouncing around in my throat so let's just pray let's just stand shall we and I'm going to turn the service over to - trip - brother Jeremy to lead us a few songs I think he's wanting you to have there one okay let's close our eyes you don't want to be remembered and pray just want to raise your hand to the Lord gracious father Lord we Lord us want to thank you that Lord when you see us Lord you don't see our humanity Lord you do not see our humanity that we wrestle against Lord but you see the blood of your son Lord our voice through the blood Lord we want to thank you for that father Lord and may we just walk in confidence Lord there you have everything under your control Lord may we not serve you out of fear but Lord may we serve you out of love and a
