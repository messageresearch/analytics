[17:29] Isn't that all of our prayer? I just
[17:32] have more of Jesus in our life. Amen.
[17:34] May he fill you tonight to overflowing.
[17:38] Amen. May this night not be wasted. May
[17:40] you redeem the time. We've driven so far
[17:43] to get here. We fought the whole day to
[17:46] make it here. You got an hour or so,
[17:49] depends how it goes, of just in his
[17:51] presence. May the Lord take the service
[17:53] and have everything under his control.
[17:55] Amen.
[17:56] May you leave your blessed. Yes.
[17:58] And if you can pull,
[18:00] he'll come knocking at your door. Just
[18:02] keep pulling. Amen. Let's just open up
[18:05] in a word of prayer. Our gracious
[18:07] heavenly father, as the music plays,
[18:10] Lord, we've done all we can. We now
[18:12] stand before you, Lord.
[18:15] If you don't come, Lord, this is all in
[18:18] vain. Father, our heart's desire is that
[18:21] you would walk closer to us, Lord, and
[18:23] we walk closer to you and that we will
[18:26] be like you and the father, Lord, when
[18:28] Jesus was here upon the earth, that you
[18:30] said, "I am in my father and my father
[18:32] in me." Lord, so we are in you, Lord,
[18:35] and we are a part of you, Lord. And we
[18:37] know that part you're going to receive
[18:39] back to yourself one day in the form of
[18:41] that rapture, Lord. And our bodies will
[18:43] be changed, Lord. and the dead in Christ
[18:46] shall rise and there will be a calling
[18:48] up Lord and we will be gathered in
[18:50] heaven meeting you right there Lord and
[18:52] we'll have an awesome time father and
[18:55] Lord I pray that tonight you will just
[18:57] give us a glimpse of that eternal life
[18:59] glimpse of that heaven that you call us
[19:01] to just a just a glimpse of why you have
[19:04] this beautiful plan of redemption and
[19:06] why you've chosen us Lord and how you
[19:08] see and how man sees Lord we just ask
[19:10] that you would just show us your word in
[19:13] simplicity Lord and that you would come
[19:15] our way, knock on our door and Lord come
[19:18] in fellowship Lord
[19:20] give us something that will give us
[19:21] strength that will build our faith Lord
[19:24] that will get us closer to you Lord
[19:26] and even if we're backslid and in such a
[19:28] state Lord that we don't even can
[19:30] recognize your voice that you would call
[19:32] those ones back
[19:34] Lord call them to repentance father call
[19:36] them to a sincere walk with you Lord
[19:38] Lord because like brother Hannah said
[19:40] we're here in the in the business of
[19:42] saving people Lord bringing them to you,
[19:44] Lord, to encourage people to walk closer
[19:47] with Jesus, to serve one another, Lord.
[19:49] So may that be our night tonight, Lord.
[19:51] May we just, Lord, minister to us and
[19:54] may we go out here, Lord, and seek those
[19:56] last ones because Lord, without them, we
[19:59] can't go home. I pray you'll bless the
[20:01] service. I take the words out of my
[20:03] mouth and you place your words in there,
[20:06] Lord. You take my thoughts away and you
[20:09] put your thoughts in there, Lord. And
[20:11] anybody that's listening, will you
[20:12] anoint them? Will will they hear this
[20:14] word for you, Lord? May you minister
[20:16] unto them, Lord. Lord, may you just do a
[20:19] one-on-one work with them tonight. I
[20:20] pray that's my heart's desire. Come our
[20:23] way, Lord Jesus, and just come and
[20:25] fellowship with us. Lord, I still want
[20:28] to pray for brother Phil in the
[20:29] hospital. Strengthen my brother, Lord.
[20:31] Help him. Any sick and afflicted that's
[20:33] here among us, strengthen them, Father.
[20:36] You are the healer. Doctors can do only
[20:38] so much. You have to do the healing,
[20:40] Lord. So I pray you'll go by them way
[20:42] Lord and you'll touch them and you will
[20:44] just speak to them and may they just
[20:46] feel like they're right in the service
[20:47] with us Lord and bless everyone there on
[20:50] the internet Lord and everybody that
[20:52] took the time to come to this service
[20:54] tonight Lord you minister to them in the
[20:57] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[21:00] Amen. Musicians, thank you so much.
[21:03] Thank you brother Josh.
[21:05] I was so blessed with all these songs.
[21:07] Um we're going to go there to the book
[21:09] of John. John 10 verse 25.
[21:14] We're going to start there.
[21:16] Who loves the Lord.
[21:17] Amen.
[21:18] Amen.
[21:30] Just going to take a sip of water. God
[21:33] bless you saints. Everybody there? Cuz
[21:36] if you read, you know when I read it,
[21:38] miss, you can read between the lines cuz
[21:39] sometimes I skip a word or two.
[21:43] And I don't mean it on purpose. It just
[21:45] happens.
[21:47] Okay. So, we're going to go there to
[21:48] verse 25.
[21:51] And Jesus answered them, "I told you
[21:54] that ye believe not the works that I do
[21:57] in my father's name. They bear witness
[21:59] of me, but ye believe not because you
[22:02] are not my sheep."
[22:04] And um as I said unto you, my sheep hear
[22:07] my voice.
[22:10] And I know them and they follow me.
[22:12] Yeah.
[22:13] It's a concept we have in the world
[22:15] today. This thing called following.
[22:17] Yeah.
[22:17] It's quite there, eh?
[22:19] Yeah.
[22:19] But see, Jesus wants you to follow him.
[22:22] Yeah.
[22:23] Amen.
[22:23] Simple. It's not asking for much.
[22:26] Doesn't say go and do great exploits. It
[22:28] says I want you to
[22:30] follow me. Okay. Let's go on. and I give
[22:33] unto them eternal life, and they shall
[22:36] never perish, neither shall a man pluck
[22:39] them out of my hand. My father which
[22:41] gave them to me. So, see, you're already
[22:43] given to God.
[22:44] Yeah,
[22:45] it's already his work. Though you can be
[22:47] in the worst state of your life, if God
[22:50] has predestinated you, you will come.
[22:53] It's done. It's He says,
[22:54] which gave them to me. So, this is past
[22:57] tense.
[22:58] He already knows you. You're written on
[23:00] the palms of his hand. So beautiful.
[23:01] say,
[23:02] "Amen."
[23:02] He says, "And greater than all, there is
[23:05] no man able to pluck them out of my
[23:07] father's hand. And I and I and my father
[23:12] are
[23:13] one."
[23:14] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[23:16] we open this Bible.
[23:18] And it's great, Lord, to be open opening
[23:20] this word, Lord. But really, you can
[23:22] only open it to us, Lord. You can only
[23:24] give us a real revelation of your word.
[23:26] So we just ask Lord that you will take
[23:28] this service, take this words, anoint
[23:30] them Lord and use them for your kingdom
[23:32] and minister unto your bride in the name
[23:34] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[23:37] You may have your seats.
[23:39] Now the thing that I was thinking about
[23:42] so this was all random. What happened is
[23:44] I had a I have a service and and we're
[23:46] going to go on with this. But I was
[23:48] sitting there about I would say about
[23:50] half 4 this afternoon. Now the Lord
[23:52] blessed me. I had a whole day where I
[23:54] could just spend time with the Lord, you
[23:56] know. So sometimes when the devil thinks
[23:58] there's nothing on, everything's on.
[24:01] So I've just spent time. I didn't put
[24:02] any pressure on it. I said, Lord, you
[24:04] just speak to your people tonight. But I
[24:05] want I want to know what you want to
[24:07] say.
[24:08] Yeah.
[24:09] And this this words came up, follow me.
[24:12] Now, now and again, I do little videos
[24:15] on our on our websites and all those
[24:17] things and and on LinkedIn, you can
[24:19] follow someone if they have a similar
[24:21] interest in you. And so it's on show
[24:23] social media, Twitter, all those places.
[24:26] You can follow someone.
[24:28] But see, you must know where this guy's
[24:30] going.
[24:30] Yeah.
[24:32] Because be careful who you follow.
[24:34] It might like look good at the eyes, but
[24:36] if you don't know where this character
[24:38] is going, be careful.
[24:39] Amen.
[24:40] Because he might lead you into the wrong
[24:42] places.
[24:44] I would actually say he will lead you
[24:46] into the wrong places.
[24:47] Now, I know they always say we follow a
[24:50] man. You know, we follow a man. We
[24:52] follow William Brham. That's what they
[24:54] say to us. You're Brandomites. You
[24:56] follow a man.
[24:57] No,
[24:58] I follow Jesus Christ.
[25:00] That man introduced me to him.
[25:04] But see, if I would follow the footsteps
[25:06] of William Brandham, I could see
[25:08] miracles happen.
[25:10] I could see people coming back to God.
[25:12] I can see I can see the power and
[25:14] demonstration of the Holy Ghost.
[25:17] I see healing. I see revival. I see
[25:20] God's the back parts of God's mind being
[25:22] told to me.
[25:23] So yes, this message is true and I
[25:26] follow the message
[25:28] but it introduced me to Jesus Christ.
[25:31] So remember, as much as we are a
[25:33] follower and we believe in the message
[25:34] and we know that the message opened up
[25:36] the word of God to us and and explained
[25:38] all the mysteries, we're not a follower
[25:40] of William Brandham.
[25:42] We're a follower of Jesus Christ.
[25:44] And Fish, you said it as well. And I and
[25:46] I I like it that we've got such great
[25:49] ministry here. Brothers that love the
[25:51] Lord that could just empty themselves
[25:53] out and God Sunday after Sunday and
[25:55] Wednesday can just minister unto his
[25:56] bride. Don't miss these moments cuz
[25:58] they're precious. They're really
[26:00] precious.
[26:01] But I want to ask you, who do you
[26:02] follow?
[26:03] Amen.
[26:05] Because we find ourselves spending a lot
[26:06] of time following people which is
[26:09] actually not worth following,
[26:10] which is just a waste of time and it's
[26:12] going to get you into a place where you
[26:14] don't really want to be.
[26:16] I also want to tell you young people and
[26:18] this is to you. I'm preaching to you. So
[26:19] don't fall asleep on me because I'll
[26:20] pick on you.
[26:22] Okay? So so you got we've got an hour.
[26:25] You you worked hard at school. You did
[26:26] all you can. This is not for the
[26:28] parents. This is for you.
[26:30] So I'm just letting you know I'm
[26:31] preaching at your level tonight. We're
[26:33] not going to try to unveil mysteries
[26:35] here. We're not going to tell you about
[26:37] major visions and all those things.
[26:38] We're going to tell you how do you pick
[26:40] your friends.
[26:42] So a simple thing like picking the right
[26:45] friend
[26:47] has a massive a massive
[26:51] weight on you
[26:53] and and an imprint on you in your life
[26:56] for the good for the bad.
[27:00] Don't try to save your friends. You
[27:02] can't do it.
[27:04] Don't try to be a friend of somebody
[27:05] that's smoking and drinking and throwing
[27:07] his life away because you're trying to
[27:08] save him. Be careful.
[27:12] Let him be your friend.
[27:15] I want you to listen. Let him be your
[27:18] friend because you're the influence.
[27:20] But if you come under someone else's
[27:22] friendship, he's the influence.
[27:24] So let you be the influence.
[27:27] Because if you're the influence, if you
[27:29] stand with all that you can stand, then
[27:32] your friends will see a sincerity, a
[27:34] honesty, an upright man right in front
[27:37] of them.
[27:37] Amen. And no matter how much you preach
[27:40] at that guy,
[27:42] your life testifies what you believe.
[27:45] Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:47] So you can't speak with this one thing
[27:48] and live with this the other thing
[27:50] because they will catch you out because
[27:52] as much as you think you have control
[27:54] over what you say and do, your life will
[27:57] just keep on living.
[27:58] That's it.
[27:59] You just keep on living. This is you.
[28:02] You're Reuben. You're AB. You're Mo.
[28:05] You're Jono. This who you are. That's
[28:07] what God made you. You can't deny this,
[28:10] you know. So sometimes your mannerisms,
[28:12] the way you react to certain stuff, the
[28:14] the things that happens, that's just how
[28:16] you would react.
[28:18] But your character must be Christ.
[28:21] Because when your friends are looking
[28:22] for Jesus Christ, I hope they can see
[28:24] him in your life.
[28:25] Amen.
[28:26] Because if they not, you're a follower
[28:28] of someone,
[28:29] right?
[28:31] So it's hard, but it's true. So when I
[28:34] was your age, I wish I picked Jesus
[28:36] Christ.
[28:37] Yeah.
[28:38] I really did.
[28:39] Because the people that led me led me
[28:41] into wrong places, really bad places.
[28:44] And though they were sincere friends,
[28:47] they were sincerely wrong.
[28:49] And I was sincerely fooled.
[28:51] So I think I hammered that point enough.
[28:54] We get it.
[28:55] Amen. Can I have a amen there, brothers?
[28:57] Amen.
[28:57] Amen. Okay. So if we preach, I need you
[29:00] to preach with me.
[29:01] All right.
[29:02] So, we're going to go there to Proverbs
[29:05] and we go Proverbs 15 and we're going to
[29:07] go verse 30.
[29:10] And there's a principle because we're
[29:12] all like doom scrolling and flicking and
[29:14] and liking and all those type of things,
[29:17] don't we?
[29:21] Oh, so none of our youth is on on in
[29:24] Instagram or Facebook or maybe not
[29:26] Facebook because that's no lame, but
[29:27] Instagram and and I don't know what
[29:30] where Snapchat and so none of you are on
[29:32] it. Hey, you all just No phones, eh?
[29:35] Yeah, right, Mo.
[29:38] Okay, so I want to tell you something.
[29:40] The moment you parents give your child a
[29:42] phone, you better have the bees and the
[29:45] and the flowers talk to them because
[29:48] guess what's on their phones?
[29:50] No matter how you try to lock that thing
[29:52] down, guess what's on their phones? So
[29:55] the moment you take a phone and you put
[29:57] it in your child's hand, you better know
[29:59] he's in the age of accountability where
[30:01] it can handle the stuff. If you've done
[30:02] it before the time, woe unto you. I warn
[30:06] you. In the name of our Lord Jesus
[30:08] Christ, I warn you, you're opening up a
[30:10] book that they can't read yet.
[30:13] Amen.
[30:13] So remember, maturity comes to a child
[30:16] when he can proves himself mature.
[30:18] Yeah.
[30:19] But you cannot give a bomb in the hand
[30:21] of a child, a TV
[30:23] in a hand of a child if they can't
[30:25] handle it yet. That's parent
[30:27] delinquency.
[30:28] That's your fault.
[30:30] Don't do it.
[30:30] Come on. No matter how much family link
[30:33] you want to lock this thing down to, if
[30:35] they can't handle it, don't give it to
[30:36] them. They're not ready. They're not
[30:38] ready.
[30:38] That's it.
[30:39] If you cannot trust them with the car
[30:41] car keys, you can't trust them with the
[30:43] money in your wallet. You can't trust
[30:45] them that far. Why would you want to
[30:46] give them a phone?
[30:51] Why? You're setting them up to fail. And
[30:54] you children that wants a phone before
[30:55] your time, you cannot handle it. You
[30:58] can't. If you're not filled with the
[31:00] Holy Ghost, you cannot handle a phone
[31:03] because what you're about to open up
[31:05] there is going to scar you and it's
[31:07] going to make an impression on you and
[31:08] you're not ready for it because you want
[31:10] to fight a fight that your parents are
[31:12] struggling to overcome sometimes.
[31:15] I've got parents I've got people that I
[31:17] know that can't stay off social media.
[31:19] They can't stay off their phone. When
[31:20] they talk to each other, there's a phone
[31:22] between them. But you children think you
[31:24] can handle this. You can't. You're not
[31:26] ready. Be careful.
[31:28] If you want a phone, get old 6110. You
[31:31] can bounce that thing off, catch it
[31:32] again, and still answer the phone.
[31:34] And it's got the little snakes thing
[31:36] that runs around. But you're not ready
[31:38] for a TV.
[31:40] You're not. Because there's people on
[31:42] you that want you to follow them.
[31:47] Oh, but I'm going to put the table on
[31:49] you. I'm going to put the message on
[31:50] you. And I'm going to read my Bible, eh?
[31:54] With my headset on and a show in the
[31:56] background. As if we didn't do that.
[31:58] I want you to realize this. Our parents
[32:00] aren't against you. We just sometimes
[32:02] know the maturity of our child. And even
[32:05] if we don't know, go pray for it. You
[32:07] pray parents before you give your
[32:09] children a phone. You go pray over it
[32:11] hard and very hard. That's right.
[32:13] And you make sure you get a yes from the
[32:14] Lord before you do that. Because if
[32:16] they're not ready, you're opening a
[32:17] world that they cannot handle.
[32:21] I want to reach my children. They don't
[32:23] need a video for me to reach them.
[32:25] They don't need to YouTube two or three
[32:27] or four hours for me to reach them. Buy
[32:30] them a 6110.
[32:35] Won't hurt them because all we want to
[32:37] know as parents is are they safe? Have
[32:39] they actually gone to AB's house? Is AB
[32:42] at AB's house?
[32:45] So now that we have established that's
[32:46] right, can I speak to Sister Shannon?
[32:48] Yep, AB is here. That's it. Reuben made
[32:51] it to AB's house. It's all you want to
[32:54] know as parents because remember what
[32:56] they be do behind your back, they'll do
[32:58] behind your back anyways. But what they
[33:00] forget is who's judging,
[33:02] who's looking, right?
[33:04] No matter what I see or what I don't
[33:06] see, God's still seeing.
[33:08] He's the allseeing eye.
[33:11] You can't hide from him. Even what you
[33:13] Google on your phone, you can't hide
[33:14] from him.
[33:16] So we go to Proverbs and it says, "The
[33:17] light of the eyes rejoicth the heart."
[33:22] So your eyes opens up a pathway to your
[33:26] heart.
[33:26] Yeah.
[33:26] And what you look upon, like fish said,
[33:29] the first look, hey, the second looks up
[33:32] to you,
[33:34] right?
[33:35] I hope you get it.
[33:36] First look, oh, second look, no ways.
[33:41] Still that power of decision is in your
[33:43] hand. It's called free moral agency.
[33:47] But you should remember that that has an
[33:49] influence upon the heart. And like a man
[33:51] thinkketh in his heart, God discerns the
[33:53] thought and the intent of the
[33:55] heart.
[33:56] So where's God looking?
[33:57] Yeah. The heart.
[33:58] So what are you putting in your heart?
[34:00] Right.
[34:01] Amen.
[34:01] I hope you you you're following me.
[34:03] Don't lose me now. This is all you young
[34:05] people.
[34:06] What are you putting in your heart?
[34:08] That's right, brother.
[34:10] Because it's going to manifest. It's a
[34:12] seed that you plant within this place
[34:14] that belongs to God. And there's rubbish
[34:17] in there and nonsense in there and it's
[34:19] manifesting and we can see it all of us.
[34:23] Who are you trying to fool? Who are you
[34:25] following? Now, I'm not trying to say
[34:27] you have to sit the whole day and just
[34:29] think on Jesus Christ. I don't don't get
[34:32] me wrong. No, no, no. I know we we think
[34:35] upon the word and we meditate upon the
[34:37] word. And you know, if we see something
[34:38] in nature, it reminds us of Christ, we
[34:40] think of Christ. Listen to me. You still
[34:43] live. You still work. You still have to
[34:45] do things. You still train. You still do
[34:46] all you do. But do it in the name of
[34:49] Jesus Christ.
[34:50] But when you have a righteous when you
[34:52] have righteousness living within you,
[34:54] the choices you make will be right.
[34:57] Amen.
[34:58] You cannot make mistakes then.
[35:00] And then no matter how much your friend
[35:02] says to bunk school and all those
[35:03] things, you will know what's right
[35:06] and you will know what's wrong.
[35:07] Amen.
[35:08] And you will stand for what's right
[35:10] because righteousness is within you.
[35:12] Amen.
[35:14] It says here, "And the good report
[35:16] maketh the bones fat." So, we're allowed
[35:19] to be fat.
[35:21] Gwyn arrived.
[35:24] You know, a good report.
[35:26] So, if your mom and dad says to you,
[35:28] "Hey, Aes, you've done really good
[35:30] today."
[35:31] Do you feel good about it? You do.
[35:34] Something in goes, h,
[35:36] you know, when when Reuben was almost
[35:39] faster than me, I retired before he
[35:41] could beat me. Yes.
[35:43] When he got really close and I say,
[35:44] "Bro, you're actually fast." He thought,
[35:47] "Thanks."
[35:48] Yeah.
[35:49] When Jono is getting stronger than me, I
[35:50] go, "Bro, Jono, you should start." He
[35:52] stopped wrestling me because last time
[35:53] he picked me up, he just dropped me. I
[35:55] went down like a lead balloon. Him and
[35:56] Josh hurt myself. Just aka bigger
[35:59] brothers. Remember that. Look after the
[36:02] old fellas.
[36:04] I said to him, "You can't wrestle me
[36:05] like that no more. You're too strong.
[36:08] But you can't tell me inside." He goes,
[36:10] he was like, So, it's good to have a
[36:13] good report on you.
[36:15] But the good report is not how you're
[36:17] doing in the world.
[36:18] The good report is not how many
[36:20] followers you have.
[36:21] The good report is not who you following
[36:23] in the world. The good report is what
[36:25] does people see in your life?
[36:27] Yeah.
[36:28] Right.
[36:28] Does it reflect Jesus Christ?
[36:31] For me, that's a good report.
[36:33] That's a godly man. That's fat.
[36:35] You know, like the fat on a bull. That's
[36:38] juicy. That's that's me and Omar had a
[36:40] discussion about this the other day
[36:42] over. That's fat. That's nice. But see
[36:45] that report we won
[36:46] because it goes on. I want to go back to
[36:48] that verse. It says, "The ear that
[36:50] heareth the reproof of life abideth
[36:54] among the wise, but he that refuseth
[36:57] instruction despise his own soul."
[37:00] So remember, there's a flip.
[37:04] So you have the choice. This gate. Leave
[37:07] the Leave that scripture up. Liam, this
[37:10] gate. Your choice.
[37:13] You reap what you sow.
[37:18] He that refusth of instruct instruction
[37:20] despiseth his own soul, but he that
[37:23] heareth reproof gatherth understanding.
[37:28] The fear of the Lord is the instruction
[37:30] of wisdom. And before honor
[37:33] is humility.
[37:35] Hey, before he says, if ye be lifted up,
[37:38] you can draw all men to yourself. But
[37:40] before you lift yourself up, go on your
[37:42] knees.
[37:43] Hallelujah.
[37:43] Get humble. Because it's not you that's
[37:45] lifting yourself up. God lifts you into
[37:47] a position. God places you in a place of
[37:50] authority where you can you can speak to
[37:52] people and live a life in such a way
[37:54] that it will get them to love Christ in
[37:56] you. Yeah.
[37:57] And then when they can love the Christ
[37:58] in you, they can see Christ is really in
[38:00] you, they can come and talk about Christ
[38:02] to you.
[38:02] Yeah.
[38:02] But before then they won't ask you one
[38:04] question. I worked for a company and it
[38:06] doesn't matter. It was a a big company
[38:08] and the one day they were doing a a word
[38:12] puzzle like these I don't know like this
[38:15] quiz the quiz and there's a Bible
[38:17] question that came up and I was one side
[38:20] sitting minding my own business typing
[38:22] one on the computer but I listen to what
[38:23] they ask all the questions cuz sometimes
[38:25] they go you know uh what was the name of
[38:28] Namibia before it became Namibia and all
[38:30] those things you know so I go oh I know
[38:32] that but the one they ask a Bible
[38:35] Christian
[38:36] and uh they all kept quiet and all went
[38:40] look straight at me and go, "So, what's
[38:41] the answer?"
[38:43] I never told them I'm a Christian.
[38:45] I never I never came in there and said,
[38:47] "Now, guys, just want to tell you I'm a
[38:49] Christian." And uh I'm going to sit in
[38:51] this cubicle. If you want to know about
[38:53] God, you can come and see me. If you
[38:54] don't want to, just can you just stay
[38:55] there, you ungodly people, and I'll just
[38:58] do my business. And if the phone rings,
[38:59] I'll answer. And if you swear, I'm going
[39:01] to tell you off. And if you use the name
[39:02] of the Lord in vain, I'm going to tell
[39:04] you off. No,
[39:06] I just was me.
[39:07] Yeah.
[39:08] If somebody said hello, I said good
[39:09] morning.
[39:10] Yeah.
[39:10] If somebody was swearing, I would walk
[39:13] away. I just I don't need to be in that
[39:16] atmosphere. Somebody spoke about my God,
[39:18] I would say, "Please don't do that. I
[39:20] love that name."
[39:22] And they quickly figure out where you
[39:24] stand.
[39:24] Yeah.
[39:25] Yeah.
[39:25] You don't need to say sometimes one
[39:27] word, but they know where you stand.
[39:29] I never hated them for it. Yeah,
[39:31] I just didn't stand for it
[39:33] because I I've got this thing called the
[39:34] gospel backbone.
[39:36] The Lord Jesus said to me, "When I made
[39:38] you a man, I made you walk up straight."
[39:41] Now, what I see in the world is the
[39:43] people walk like this.
[39:46] Right?
[39:47] Huh? We're going to get there. They walk
[39:49] like this.
[39:50] Like their boss,
[39:52] Lucifer, the one that's that's like
[39:54] this. He can never come with a straight
[39:56] answer to you. He always have to come
[39:57] around the corner,
[39:58] try to bite you in the heel. Hey,
[40:01] just like a serpent.
[40:03] That was his name. That's what Adam
[40:04] named him. So I just kids for your
[40:07] information, Satan wasn't a snake
[40:10] in the garden of Eden.
[40:12] His name was serpent. Adam named him.
[40:15] Okay. So his name was serpent. The most
[40:18] subtle beast of the field.
[40:20] Y
[40:21] God cursed him. Then the serpent became
[40:24] a snake. And then he was a snake.
[40:26] He was not a snake from the beginning.
[40:28] Go read that book again. I I encourage
[40:31] you.
[40:31] Okay. Don't miss that because if you
[40:33] make a mistake like the world makes a
[40:34] mistake, you miss the whole revelation
[40:36] of what serpent seed is all about. Go
[40:39] read Genesis.
[40:41] Amen. So, we're going to go on Matthew
[40:43] 23 11 and 12. Let's go there. Matthew 23
[40:48] 11 and 12. I want you to I want to hear
[40:51] those pages because then nobody's
[40:52] falling asleep on me. Please. Amen.
[41:01] But he says here and I'm talking about
[41:04] humility. Remember proverbs says before
[41:06] I can you can be honored before people
[41:09] will really see who you are you first
[41:10] have to humble yourself. So it says here
[41:12] in Matthew 23:11 and 12 it says but ye
[41:16] that is great among you shall be your
[41:19] servant.
[41:20] Yeah. So he might have an awesome time
[41:22] in the world and have all the riches and
[41:24] drive 24 Cadillacs and seven BMWs and
[41:26] whatever. He will be the least if he
[41:29] makes it.
[41:31] I just want to tell you
[41:32] if he makes it. It doesn't matter that
[41:34] he's rich is going to go to hell. He
[41:36] might even make it because remember what
[41:37] what who was it that preached about
[41:39] that? The man that was so it was a test.
[41:42] Oh, brother Ron Spencer I think spoke
[41:44] about it as well. He says sometimes God
[41:45] can No, it wasn't. Shouldn't tell you
[41:47] who was it. It was brother Isaac. Yeah,
[41:49] there you go. I know you're in trouble.
[41:50] Please go listen to that one again.
[41:52] Doesn't mean that if you're rich, you're
[41:53] you're you're going to have to go
[41:55] through the eye of a needle to get into
[41:56] heaven.
[41:58] Some people, God blessed them with
[41:59] riches and they can they can help.
[42:01] Brother Brandham's campaigns was paid by
[42:02] a lot of people that had a lot of money
[42:05] and they were there because they were
[42:06] businessmen.
[42:07] It's not what I'm talking about. I'm
[42:09] talking about Yeah. the greatest.
[42:11] So the guy that esteems himself higher
[42:13] than the other one,
[42:14] you might find him being just a little
[42:16] bit lower than the other one.
[42:17] Yeah. So it's pastors, it's deacons,
[42:20] it's officers, it's people in the
[42:21] church. Never look at the guy and say,
[42:23] "Hey, that sermon's for him.
[42:24] It's for you."
[42:26] And whosoever shall exalt shall be
[42:29] abased.
[42:30] For he that humble himself shall be
[42:32] exalted.
[42:33] Yes, sir.
[42:34] So this is just how God sees it.
[42:36] And he says, "If you get humble, I will
[42:39] lift you up. I will show you. I will
[42:41] reward you openly."
[42:43] Don't worry, guys. Hang in there. We're
[42:44] almost there. Get to the best part now.
[42:47] Yes. Here we go. So, spirits don't die.
[42:51] Who who who thinks, you know, it's the
[42:54] people that sin? Who thinks if David has
[42:57] done something wrong, it's just David
[42:59] being an egg?
[43:03] Cuz you're looking wrong then, isn't it?
[43:06] Because there's an influence upon David
[43:08] when he did something wrong. He had to
[43:10] make a choice. Right or wrong, he had to
[43:12] make a choice to do something wrong.
[43:14] Now, I didn't say David do something
[43:16] wrong, but he's always a nice prime
[43:17] example because he's right in the front.
[43:19] Thanks, David. But what what if he made
[43:23] a mistake
[43:25] and he did something wrong? Should I be
[43:27] angry at David?
[43:30] No, he made a mistake. There was
[43:32] something that pushed on him that was
[43:35] saying, "Do it this way." And he did it
[43:37] that way. Same as David and Bashibba
[43:40] when he killed Uriah.
[43:42] He looked at something. It filled his
[43:45] heart. He got a desire for it. He killed
[43:47] the husband and he paid the price for
[43:49] it.
[43:51] But was it David? No. It was an enticing
[43:54] spirit upon him. And spirits don't die.
[43:57] And I can prove to you the same spirit
[43:59] that's on the world and all the
[44:01] celebrities and all the the people that
[44:03] is honorable and and and fashionable and
[44:06] or not honorable but fashionable and hip
[44:08] and cool and all those things. Remember
[44:10] I'm real old. I don't know the slang
[44:11] today again.
[44:13] But the guys that really is the top tier
[44:16] supernovas of this world
[44:19] not word.
[44:20] Yeah.
[44:21] The anointing is on them.
[44:23] Yeah.
[44:23] But they've got a spirit on them. Mhm.
[44:26] And if you look at the video, which you
[44:28] should not look because I shouldn't
[44:29] really go and look there. I can tell you
[44:32] just by using your discernment,
[44:34] you can see that spirit. And I'm going
[44:35] to tell you which spirit it is. I want
[44:37] you to go to the book of Isaiah.
[44:41] Isaiah 14.
[44:44] I'll go there, too.
[44:50] See if my Bible app because I made some
[44:52] notes here.
[45:00] And we're going to go there to vers 12.
[45:04] It starts there. Now, I want you to look
[45:07] look at this spirit. Look at the spirit.
[45:10] This spirit, this is this is exalted
[45:14] itself above the sons of God. This is
[45:16] what he wants to do. Oh, Lucifer.
[45:17] Yeah.
[45:18] It says there, how they are fallen from
[45:20] heaven. Oh Lucifer, son of the morning,
[45:22] how art they cut down to the ground
[45:25] which thou that didest weaken the
[45:27] nations? For thou has said in thy heart,
[45:30] I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt
[45:33] my throne above the stars of God. I will
[45:36] sit also upon the mount of congregation
[45:39] in the sides of the north. I will ascend
[45:42] above the heights of the clouds. I will
[45:45] be like the most high. I will I will
[45:50] Yeah.
[45:51] My my show.
[45:52] Yeah.
[45:53] You follow me cuz I got the big boat. I
[45:57] got the cool girls.
[45:59] I win everything. I got the
[46:01] sponsorships.
[46:03] I got the gift. Gift and callings is
[46:06] without repentance. You believe. You
[46:08] have faith to believe in anything. It's
[46:10] yours. I It's all about me.
[46:13] Yeah. Come on.
[46:15] Me here.
[46:17] Me there. See, kick another goal, make
[46:21] another million, get another signing,
[46:24] another hoop, another strategy, buy
[46:26] another helicopter. I, I, me, me.
[46:30] Same spirit on them.
[46:32] Amen.
[46:33] And you know, brother Brandham said
[46:34] there was three things that's always
[46:35] going to test you young men, ministers,
[46:37] but all of us.
[46:40] money.
[46:41] Jono,
[46:43] fame
[46:46] and
[46:47] woman. What do celebrities have? Money,
[46:52] fame, and can they even keep the
[46:56] relationships together?
[46:58] No.
[47:00] Because they don't have God.
[47:03] Hallelujah.
[47:03] They have everything but God.
[47:06] Yeah.
[47:08] They divorce this one, lose half their
[47:10] kingdom. Oh, it's just $23 billion. I
[47:12] don't care. I've got another 23. Let's
[47:13] just go on.
[47:14] Y,
[47:16] it's
[47:16] the world.
[47:17] I want to sleep with who I want to
[47:19] sleep. I want to date who I want to
[47:20] date. I want to eat what I want to eat.
[47:22] I want to play when I want to play. I
[47:23] want to do I I I. And we follow them and
[47:27] we look at them
[47:29] and they're leading you astray. Yeah.
[47:32] You know, when when Israelite chose Saul
[47:35] to be the king over them, it was
[47:37] Israel's choice,
[47:39] not God's choice.
[47:40] God didn't want to send them a king.
[47:44] But see, after it all started falling
[47:46] apart and their king couldn't cut the
[47:48] mustard because they chose, they
[47:49] followed a man by the look how he
[47:52] looked, how big his shoulders was, how
[47:54] nice his hair was. He was the biggest
[47:56] man yet he could not face a giant.
[47:59] Yeah.
[48:02] Let's go to the book and I'm I'm I'm
[48:04] going to get into it now. Now we're
[48:05] getting into the service. I want you
[48:06] guys to follow me now. Go to Samuel 16.
[48:09] We're going to go into the life of
[48:11] Daniel. So now remember, Israel chose
[48:14] Saul. They went to Samuel and they said,
[48:17] "Samuel, I we want a king."
[48:21] God says to him, Samuel goes back to God
[48:23] and I'm going to just bring you up to
[48:24] speed. And he goes to God and he says,
[48:27] he says, "They want a king." He says,
[48:30] "Hey, don't be angry. They didn't reject
[48:34] you. They rejected me
[48:37] because I was leading them with Joshua.
[48:39] I was leading them with Moses. I was
[48:42] doing all the work. They rejecting me,
[48:44] not you." He says, "But you, Moses, you
[48:48] go and tell them.
[48:50] Tell them what that king is going to do
[48:52] to them. Tell them how he's going to
[48:54] rule them. Warn them, but I'll give them
[48:58] their king. So sometimes a minister will
[49:01] warn you what God's going to do. But you
[49:03] still want your king.
[49:05] You still want your way.
[49:08] It's hard. This is not a it's not I
[49:10] don't try to burn your kids. But God is
[49:13] warning Israel, Saul is not the king for
[49:15] you. I am the king for you. But see what
[49:17] happens is them petting themselves to
[49:20] the other kingdoms.
[49:21] Yeah. So they are looking left and right
[49:24] and all they see is all the other
[49:25] kingdoms have kings
[49:27] but our king is unseen. Though he's the
[49:29] most powerful entity
[49:32] doing miracles and wonders in our midst.
[49:34] Amen.
[49:34] I just can't see him right now.
[49:38] Kids, don't miss this point.
[49:40] Because you can't see God right now
[49:42] don't mean he's not here.
[49:44] Amen.
[49:46] I promise you if you surrender yourself
[49:48] to God, he will anoint you to do the
[49:52] biggest exploits you've ever seen.
[49:54] Amen.
[49:56] And God will get the glory.
[49:58] Yes.
[49:59] But see, if you're just following a
[50:00] earthly kingdom,
[50:02] or and will bring it into spiritual
[50:04] realms. Pentecost made the big mistake
[50:07] because Pentecost started looking around
[50:09] at everybody else
[50:11] and because all the other churches could
[50:13] wear what they want, do what they want,
[50:15] cut their hair, wear makeup, sleep
[50:18] around, do all those type of things.
[50:20] They said, "Oh, but they still in the
[50:22] church." And they let the bars down.
[50:25] And guess what? The goats came in.
[50:32] Prophet of God said it. I can give you
[50:33] the quote. I I might even say it because
[50:36] it wasn't rules and regulations. It was
[50:38] a desire in their heart to be like the
[50:41] other churches, to have big churches, to
[50:44] have big revivals. They didn't want the
[50:47] word of God. They wanted a show.
[50:50] And God says, "I don't want this." And
[50:52] he just stepped out of it
[50:55] and he moved on.
[50:58] And then he sent the prophet to say,
[50:59] "Hey, this is not the way I want you. I
[51:02] want you here in the revelation of Jesus
[51:05] Christ between these pages.
[51:06] Amen.
[51:07] Praise the Lord.
[51:08] I don't want you to have a famous
[51:10] preacher come and preach at you and then
[51:12] only you believe. I want you to walk
[51:14] with me every day in these pages.
[51:16] Amen.
[51:17] You and me 101.
[51:19] Can we go on? So Samuel 16:1. Now you
[51:22] can follow me. So then you won't fall
[51:24] asleep. Please, if you fall asleep, I
[51:26] might call you out.
[51:28] You can hang in there. It's only been 24
[51:30] minutes for crying out loud. If you need
[51:32] to stand up, go stand up.
[51:37] I will call you out. Um, okay. So, it
[51:42] says here,
[51:44] uh, what did I say? 16. E, I'm just a
[51:47] page ahead. Get ahead of myself all the
[51:49] time. Forgive me. There we go. A new
[51:53] king. And the Lord said unto Samuel, now
[51:56] remember, Saul failed miserably. Yeah.
[51:59] And God said, "No ways. I I going to
[52:01] have to stop this." So, I'm going to
[52:04] pick a king. So God and he says, "And
[52:08] the Lord said unto Samuel, how long will
[52:11] thou mourn for Saul, seeing that I have
[52:13] rejected him from reigning over Israel?
[52:17] Fill thy horn with oil, and go, and I
[52:19] will send you to Jess, a Bethlehemite,
[52:22] for I have provided me a king."
[52:26] So now things are happening different.
[52:29] God says they want to see a king but let
[52:31] me pick him.
[52:33] Let cuz I don't look like man look.
[52:37] I'm going to pick that king.
[52:39] Yeah.
[52:40] And it goes on and we read on. It says
[52:42] and Samuel said how can I go if Saul
[52:44] hear of it? He'll kill me. And the Lord
[52:46] said, "Take an hepher with thee, and
[52:48] say, I come to the sacrifice of the
[52:50] Lord, and call Jess to the sacrifice, or
[52:54] Jesse, um, and I will show thee what to
[52:58] what thou shalt do, and thou shalt
[53:00] anoint unto me him who I name unto you."
[53:05] So, who's going to pick him? Samuel?
[53:08] No. God's going to pick him.
[53:10] That's right.
[53:10] Let's get this right.
[53:12] Amen.
[53:14] I'm going to throw this in here as
[53:15] another one of those boomerangs. Who's
[53:17] going to pick your friends?
[53:21] Who's going to pick your friends?
[53:24] God must pick your friends.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:27] Do you actually pray over your friends?
[53:30] And say, "Lord, if this relationship is
[53:31] not of you and it's a hindering to my
[53:34] walk with you,
[53:35] send someone else."
[53:37] Right? because I don't want to be ll
[53:39] cool J and end up in hell or going
[53:41] through the trial of my life to get you
[53:43] to get me back into position. Is this
[53:45] the right friend of me?
[53:47] And if it's not, walk away.
[53:50] And God will show you. Because the very
[53:52] next day when you walk into school, I
[53:54] can promise you. I can promise you if
[53:57] you ask God to show you, he will show
[53:59] you exactly why not or why.
[54:02] Cuz we ain't playing with the devil.
[54:04] Amen.
[54:06] And because you're coming in sincerity
[54:08] and you're saying, "Lord, I don't want
[54:10] to choose by my eyes and by the coolness
[54:12] of the of the person. I want you to
[54:14] choose God and Alisa will send you the
[54:17] right friend."
[54:19] That was going to add to your faith.
[54:21] It's going to add to your walk. And even
[54:23] if you need to bring her in and God will
[54:25] use you, that will be this
[54:27] because your life has to achieve
[54:29] something. You're not here. There's no
[54:31] mistake.
[54:32] You It has to achieve something, guys.
[54:34] Amen.
[54:35] We're not just haphazardly here.
[54:38] You're not here just to float on the
[54:40] water. It has to achieve something for
[54:41] God's kingdom.
[54:43] Okay, I'm going off the track.
[54:46] And Jesus called and sent the sacrifice
[54:49] and I will show thee what and name to
[54:51] thee. And he said, okay, verse four. And
[54:53] Samuel did that which the Lord spake and
[54:56] came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the
[54:59] town trembled
[55:02] as he's coming because remember he's a
[55:03] prophet. Yeah,
[55:04] a prophet comes to you to speak in the
[55:06] name of a prophet. Be careful.
[55:09] He comes with thus sayith the Lord. Is
[55:11] something coming? It's some sometimes
[55:12] cutting, sometimes building, but it's
[55:14] coming.
[55:15] Comes thou peaceibly, they ask him.
[55:18] Whoa.
[55:19] Think about those days. What do you see?
[55:21] They called them seers. But here comes
[55:22] Samuel. He's just walking in. He's got
[55:24] the horn and the horn with the oil and a
[55:27] and a heer behind him. We're going to
[55:29] make a sacrifice. The very first thing
[55:30] is, whoa, hold on.
[55:32] Are we at war? Oh, we at peace. And he
[55:34] goes, "No, guys, relax. I've come to
[55:36] make a sacrifice." Hey, the the respect
[55:39] they had for a man of God,
[55:41] the respect you will get if you're a man
[55:44] of God and you walk in God and you walk
[55:46] with God, it's a different it's a
[55:48] different calling.
[55:50] Yes.
[55:50] People will know you're a real man.
[55:54] See, this is the coolness is not what
[55:56] the world gives you.
[55:57] Coolness is what God gives you.
[55:59] Stability, a strong, healthy young man.
[56:02] Yes.
[56:02] Or women.
[56:03] Amen.
[56:04] That's what the world wants to see these
[56:05] days. There's enough superstars out
[56:07] there. Why don't you be a real star, the
[56:10] son of God?
[56:10] Amen.
[56:11] Amen. I want to encourage you guys.
[56:13] Don't don't miss this.
[56:15] There's enough superstars.
[56:18] I don't know why I'm preaching here
[56:19] though. I'm sorry, brother Colin. It's
[56:21] not at UA,
[56:23] but you're young. Well,
[56:24] I am.
[56:25] That's it. Amen. All God's children. And
[56:28] he said, "Un peacefully, I come to
[56:31] sacrifice for the Lord. Sanctify
[56:32] yourselves and come with me a
[56:34] sacrifice." And he and he sanctified
[56:37] Jesse and his sons and called them to
[56:40] the sacrifice. Now, I want to let you
[56:43] know that David wasn't here.
[56:45] That's right.
[56:48] So, David didn't get sanctified.
[56:51] David wasn't even the account. He was
[56:53] written off
[56:54] because Jesse never thought that that
[56:57] little scrawny fellow was going to make
[56:58] it.
[56:59] Yeah.
[57:01] Right.
[57:02] He wasn't here. So remember, he was
[57:03] still attending the sheep. This was held
[57:05] with Jesse's sons. And I find there's
[57:08] David's not there,
[57:09] right?
[57:10] Because if Samuel asked, and I just want
[57:12] to drop this in. Samuel asked Jesse, "Is
[57:15] there one more? Is there another?"
[57:18] So if he was here, he would have seen
[57:20] him and goes, "Hey, where's that other
[57:21] kid gone?" No. He said he wasn't even
[57:24] here
[57:26] cuz we're looking as man looks. And
[57:28] Jesse when he brought his sons brought
[57:29] what he thought would be the right idea,
[57:32] not ask God. And we'll skip a little bit
[57:35] on. We're going to go. Oh no. And it
[57:37] came to pass when they come and he
[57:39] looked at Elab um uh Elab and surely the
[57:43] Nord's anointed is before me. Now Samuel
[57:46] looks at this Elab and he goes, "Bro,
[57:48] this is the guy. I got him.
[57:52] But the Lord said unto Samuel, "Look not
[57:54] on his countenance, or nor at his
[57:56] height, nor on his um stature, because I
[58:01] have refused him. For the Lord see not
[58:03] as man seeth. Man lookketh outward
[58:06] appearance, but the Lord lookketh on the
[58:09] Okay. So, why should you protect your
[58:12] eyes?" Young people, did you appreciate?
[58:14] Hands up. Who's got the answer? Why
[58:15] should you protect these eyes from what
[58:17] they're seeing? What does it feed?
[58:22] goes to your heart.
[58:24] That's right.
[58:25] You protect your eyes because the
[58:27] principle is God is looking what's in
[58:29] your heart.
[58:31] And if you feed everything through your
[58:33] eyes, it will go into your heart. So be
[58:34] careful what you're looking on. If you
[58:36] see it on accident, hey, I agree with
[58:39] fish. You're like, "Woo, okay, you got
[58:40] me there." But shame on you for looking
[58:43] twice
[58:46] because now it's you choosing to look
[58:47] again. And now there's things that you
[58:50] put in there that you don't need. It's
[58:52] rubbish.
[58:52] Amen.
[58:53] Throw it away.
[58:55] All of us. We don't need it. You fill
[58:58] this up with gunk. It's going to gunk up
[59:00] and you're going to break down.
[59:02] True.
[59:05] We go on. I'm I'm about to close. Just
[59:08] shout now and again to get everyone
[59:10] awake.
[59:13] Okay.
[59:15] And then we know the rest of the sons
[59:18] passed by. We're just going to go for a
[59:19] bit for a time. And again Jesse made
[59:23] seven of his sons to pass before verse
[59:24] 10 before Samuel. And Samuel said unto
[59:27] Jesse, "The Lord hath not chosen thee."
[59:30] And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are this
[59:33] all their children?"
[59:35] Hey.
[59:36] Yeah.
[59:37] Because God sent me. Yeah.
[59:39] He said, "The one I need to anoint is
[59:41] here. Is this all your children?"
[59:44] And uh let's just go on. And Samuel
[59:47] said, "All your children here." And he
[59:49] said, "There remainth the youngest, and
[59:52] behold, he keepeth the sheep." And
[59:55] Samuel said unto Jesus, "Send and fetch
[59:57] him, for we will not sit down until he
[59:59] comes hid." Now, I want to throw
[1:00:01] something in there that Brother Brandham
[1:00:02] said about David. Brother Brandham said,
[1:00:05] "When David was born, he knew God was
[1:00:08] with him."
[1:00:08] Yeah.
[1:00:10] That's why he had gifts. And God showed
[1:00:13] him through his gifts. So, so even
[1:00:15] attending the sheep, he knew God was
[1:00:18] with him.
[1:00:18] Hallelujah.
[1:00:20] Now, I want to give you the other side.
[1:00:22] I want to tell all of you young people,
[1:00:24] God is with you.
[1:00:26] And since you've been born,
[1:00:28] you didn't make it into this building on
[1:00:31] an accident.
[1:00:32] That's right.
[1:00:33] Even if you had to get your mom and
[1:00:35] daddy in first or your grandma and
[1:00:36] grandpa first, don't become a message
[1:00:39] child.
[1:00:40] Amen. God got you here because he's got
[1:00:43] a purpose. So, he unfortunately had to
[1:00:46] get the old fellas in first for you
[1:00:47] young fellas to come in.
[1:00:50] But don't just think this is me and
[1:00:52] mommy's gospel or or brother Ben's
[1:00:54] gospel. He wanted you in.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] Cuz or else you wouldn't be sitting
[1:00:58] here. You wouldn't be here.
[1:01:00] So, if you find yourself walking through
[1:01:02] a door and it's called the church and
[1:01:04] you're sitting down and a preacher
[1:01:06] starts preaching, don't think you're
[1:01:07] here just to fill a seat.
[1:01:09] Exactly. Amen.
[1:01:10] God wants your attention.
[1:01:12] Amen.
[1:01:13] Amen.
[1:01:14] He really wants to because remember he
[1:01:16] loved David. David was a man of his own
[1:01:19] heart.
[1:01:20] He loved David. So when he saw David
[1:01:22] growing up and looking after the sheep,
[1:01:24] it might feel very insignificant. He
[1:01:26] didn't have a big battle. He didn't He
[1:01:28] wasn't a warrior or anything like that.
[1:01:30] Every day he didn't go and practice
[1:01:32] against a tree maybe to to fight and
[1:01:33] sticks. You know, we boys always do
[1:01:35] that. And then you hit the stump and it
[1:01:36] hits you on the head and you think, "Oh,
[1:01:38] well." But he looked at David and he and
[1:01:40] he was always with David. And David knew
[1:01:43] God was with him.
[1:01:44] He didn't know God yet, but he knew God
[1:01:47] was with him.
[1:01:48] And so Jesse calls him and and here he
[1:01:51] sees him and he anoints him with oil.
[1:01:54] But now his walk with God starts. So
[1:01:57] when you filled with the Holy Ghost, you
[1:01:59] give your life to Christ and you get
[1:02:01] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:02:03] the remission of your sins and he fills
[1:02:05] you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:07] Then you stop.
[1:02:08] Yeah.
[1:02:08] That's number one. Then we have then
[1:02:11] then now all of a sudden the whole
[1:02:13] battle begins for David. And I'll
[1:02:15] explain to you why we go on. We're
[1:02:17] almost there. Hang in there. He says
[1:02:19] here in verse let's go to verse 18. Oh
[1:02:23] no no no. Verse 14. Go to verse 14. So
[1:02:26] now remember, oh poor Saul, I hope
[1:02:28] you're following me.
[1:02:29] Amen.
[1:02:29] So Jesse, just speak David. Samuel just
[1:02:33] picked David, son of Jesse. And and
[1:02:35] David now got anointed and he goes,
[1:02:37] "You're going to be king." But now, see,
[1:02:40] but the spirit of the Lord departed from
[1:02:42] Saul. The moment that happens, God says,
[1:02:45] "I'm going to remove the kingdom from
[1:02:46] Saul and I'm going to give it to David."
[1:02:49] There's a prophecy now over David's
[1:02:50] life. There's a prophecy over all of
[1:02:53] your life. It's called you're going to
[1:02:54] overcome.
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] By the blood of the lamb
[1:03:00] and the word of your testimony.
[1:03:03] But for you to have a testimony,
[1:03:05] you're going to have to fight a little
[1:03:07] bit.
[1:03:08] Because the best battle is the one that
[1:03:10] you've won.
[1:03:11] And not by your own ability, by God
[1:03:13] anointing you to fight that fight.
[1:03:15] Yes, sir.
[1:03:16] Stay with me. We're almost there.
[1:03:19] I've only been 36 minutes.
[1:03:23] I'll really try to go fast. So now Saul
[1:03:27] in verse 14, the evil spirit of the Lord
[1:03:30] of the the spirit of the Lord depart and
[1:03:32] an evil spirit from the Lord troubleth
[1:03:34] him.
[1:03:36] Now I want you to realize this is day
[1:03:39] one of David's walk as king.
[1:03:44] Day one. I'm going to explain to you a
[1:03:47] little bit what David went through, but
[1:03:48] this is day one. and said, "And Saul's
[1:03:51] servant said unto him, Behold now, an
[1:03:53] evil spirit from God troubleth thee. Let
[1:03:57] our Lord now command thy servants which
[1:03:59] are before thee." So they knew
[1:04:01] something's up with Saul.
[1:04:03] Yeah.
[1:04:03] Cuz he's very cranky.
[1:04:05] Not a happy camper.
[1:04:07] Okay. You still with me, Mo?
[1:04:10] Yes. Amen. Just checking.
[1:04:14] And Saul's servant said unto him, "Now
[1:04:17] the Lord commanded thy servants which go
[1:04:18] before thee to seek out a man who is a
[1:04:20] cunning player on a harp."
[1:04:23] Wow. This guy's got an evil spirit.
[1:04:26] We're going to fix it with some music.
[1:04:28] Yeah.
[1:04:30] What music are you listening to?
[1:04:33] Do we want to go there? No. What music
[1:04:37] are you listening to?
[1:04:40] because it's going to feed an evil
[1:04:42] spirit if it's not from God.
[1:04:46] Am I wrong, B?
[1:04:49] I'll tell you this.
[1:04:51] Just to make it a bit more personal for
[1:04:53] you. I used to listen to Metallica, Le
[1:04:55] Zeppelin, AC/DC, any Yes, sister. Okay,
[1:04:59] that bad. I used to listen to any trash
[1:05:01] Oasism,
[1:05:03] Oreo, Speed Wagon, everything that was
[1:05:05] under the earth that was to do with
[1:05:07] country, all those things. I'll tell you
[1:05:09] where it got me.
[1:05:10] Yeah. Right.
[1:05:11] Nowhere.
[1:05:12] Yeah. True.
[1:05:13] Very fast.
[1:05:16] Yeah.
[1:05:16] Because remember, and leave that up.
[1:05:19] Don't take that off. So, because then I
[1:05:22] can follow back where I was, please,
[1:05:24] because I don't want to go sidetracked.
[1:05:25] Remember what you listen to as well
[1:05:29] and what you see. This is all things
[1:05:31] that help you through this world.
[1:05:34] But it is connected.
[1:05:36] So when you walk into the house and your
[1:05:38] mom made a roast, what's the first thing
[1:05:39] you do? You go,
[1:05:40] "Oh, mom made a roast." You're like, Jon
[1:05:44] will be like,
[1:05:46] "Huh?" So mom made a nice roast. We're
[1:05:49] in for some good meat.
[1:05:50] Yeah,
[1:05:51] he's a foodie. So he appreciates food.
[1:05:55] And Chantel as well.
[1:05:56] She loves food.
[1:05:58] But then already your spirit is lifted.
[1:06:00] You're happy.
[1:06:02] We're getting nice food. It's just a
[1:06:04] smell. How can a smell just produce
[1:06:07] that?
[1:06:08] Because it's connected to a emotion. An
[1:06:10] emotion is connected to a memory. And a
[1:06:13] memory was last Sunday, Mom's Roach was
[1:06:15] the best.
[1:06:16] So, I hope there's potatoes as well
[1:06:19] because it's connected. And music, I
[1:06:22] tell you now, is connected with memories
[1:06:26] because you can play me any song right
[1:06:28] now that I listen to back then and boom,
[1:06:31] I'll be back where I was in 1992, 98,
[1:06:34] 2004, wherever.
[1:06:37] One song. Am I right? Come on.
[1:06:39] Come here, old fellas. Let's say come
[1:06:41] on.
[1:06:42] Tell me you didn't listen to Neil
[1:06:44] Diamond one day and and now a Neil
[1:06:46] Diamond song. You walk there and Neil
[1:06:47] Diamond plays, you go, "Whoa, that's
[1:06:49] random. I just thought about that.
[1:06:51] because it was connected to a memory.
[1:06:54] It's powerful.
[1:06:56] So, you want to feed yourself full of
[1:06:58] music that's not of God. It's going to
[1:07:00] have an effect on your life because it
[1:07:03] will go into your heart and will still
[1:07:05] manifest. And some of you guys don't
[1:07:07] even listen to the words. You only
[1:07:09] listen to the
[1:07:11] and you think it's cool because it's a
[1:07:13] nice beat, but have you actually
[1:07:15] discerned the words that that artist is
[1:07:18] singing?
[1:07:18] That's right. That's right.
[1:07:20] Yep.
[1:07:21] It could be the biggest trash, but we're
[1:07:23] still listening to it.
[1:07:24] Yeah.
[1:07:25] So, Saul's got an evil spirit. And how
[1:07:28] he's members in his kingdom is going to
[1:07:30] go against this is they're going to go,
[1:07:32] "Let's get him some tunes. He needs
[1:07:34] iTunes.
[1:07:36] He needs some
[1:07:38] some of Isaac's songs.
[1:07:40] Peace be still." He needs peace be still
[1:07:43] right now because every time something
[1:07:45] happens, he gets upset. And we just want
[1:07:47] peace be still on the heart.
[1:07:49] So he goes and downloads iTunes and
[1:07:51] sends it to his guys. And no, they went
[1:07:53] to fetch David
[1:07:55] because David was a musician.
[1:07:58] David had a gift.
[1:08:00] Yeah.
[1:08:00] David wasn't scared to use his gift.
[1:08:03] Yeah.
[1:08:03] God knew that he had a gift because when
[1:08:05] he was looking after the sheep, he gave
[1:08:07] him that gift.
[1:08:09] And every day while looking after the
[1:08:11] sheep, he was playing his harp.
[1:08:14] I I don't think you can go how great our
[1:08:16] god so fast but something similar like
[1:08:19] it's bubbling
[1:08:21] he was just playing his harp. He was
[1:08:23] happy and I promise you he was keeping
[1:08:25] yourself because he knew God and he was
[1:08:28] in a happy place and he expressed
[1:08:29] himself on the harp
[1:08:31] and he would use that instrument. You
[1:08:33] musos you people and the the little
[1:08:36] brothers and sisters think you're just
[1:08:37] here for nothing. You've got a gift.
[1:08:40] Yes. Prayer is a gift.
[1:08:43] Discernment is a gift.
[1:08:46] I think sometimes longsuffering is a
[1:08:48] gift, too. We suffer with you guys
[1:08:51] sometimes.
[1:08:54] Speaking in tongues, interpretation,
[1:08:57] prophecy.
[1:08:58] Who says you just have to be a muso?
[1:09:00] That's
[1:09:01] right.
[1:09:01] What about the rest of the gifts?
[1:09:03] Amen.
[1:09:04] Where's those prayer warriors?
[1:09:06] Where's the discernment? When all four
[1:09:08] of these fellows get next to the river
[1:09:10] and the water's flowing faster and they
[1:09:11] go, "Let's jump in." And the one with
[1:09:13] the sermon goes, "Nope.
[1:09:16] Bad idea. It's a gift."
[1:09:20] Cuz the others didn't see that. They
[1:09:22] didn't look at the situation. They were
[1:09:24] having fun. And the one with the gifts
[1:09:25] is not always the boring ones. It's the
[1:09:27] one that God anoints at a certain time
[1:09:29] to save you from the enemy.
[1:09:31] Amen.
[1:09:32] It's a gift.
[1:09:34] It's not a curse. So if you're the lame,
[1:09:36] boring dude, be the lame, boring dude.
[1:09:38] But be the alive lame, boring dude.
[1:09:42] Come on.
[1:09:44] It's just Brother Ben. Come on, man.
[1:09:46] Let's just get some amen here.
[1:09:52] Spending time with little kids.
[1:09:55] I saw Liam the other day spending time
[1:09:57] with with the little ones. You know how
[1:10:00] important you are to the generation
[1:10:02] underneath you.
[1:10:03] That's right. You know how God could use
[1:10:05] you as an example for the ones
[1:10:07] underneath you to help their walk with
[1:10:09] God.
[1:10:11] You don't have to preach at them. Kick a
[1:10:14] ball, catch them, swing them, something
[1:10:17] small.
[1:10:18] Yeah.
[1:10:18] You might never know the impact you have
[1:10:21] on those little ones.
[1:10:22] That's right.
[1:10:22] For just being you.
[1:10:24] It's a gift. God placed you here to to
[1:10:27] express that gift. Don't torment it
[1:10:30] because the cool people that you follow
[1:10:32] don't want it.
[1:10:34] Follow Jesus Christ. He will he will
[1:10:37] ignite it.
[1:10:39] You'll be like a burning bush. You will
[1:10:40] not be consumed.
[1:10:43] You will set everybody around you a
[1:10:44] flame. You'll have a revival because
[1:10:47] you're doing what God wants you to do.
[1:10:49] Amen.
[1:10:50] So David goes there and when David gets
[1:10:53] there and I'm about to close. I just
[1:10:55] want to stop because I think this is a
[1:10:56] good place to stop. But David gets to
[1:10:58] Saul and he plays the harp and the evil
[1:11:02] spirit leaves Saul. But I want you to
[1:11:05] realize before we get there, let's go to
[1:11:08] verse 18. Please
[1:11:11] remember David before this was only on
[1:11:15] the sheep field.
[1:11:19] Remember we still put David in time.
[1:11:21] He's on the he's busy looking after
[1:11:23] sheep. He hasn't slain Goliath yet.
[1:11:26] has not done any great thing yet. And
[1:11:30] they answered one of the servants and
[1:11:32] said, "Behold, I've seen the son of
[1:11:34] Jesse the Bethanite. He is cunning and
[1:11:37] playing. He's a mighty, valiant man."
[1:11:41] Hey, he's looking after sheep man.
[1:11:45] But this is the testimony that's come
[1:11:47] before the king. And he says he's a man
[1:11:51] of war.
[1:11:54] Have you seen that he hasn't showed up
[1:11:56] to Goliath's battle? He hasn't one day
[1:11:59] of training in the army.
[1:12:01] But this this this testimony of him just
[1:12:03] being a little shepherd boy says he's a
[1:12:05] man of war.
[1:12:06] He's prudent in matters. So he takes his
[1:12:09] job serious
[1:12:11] on timely man.
[1:12:14] He says and he's a comely person and the
[1:12:18] Lord is with him. Amen.
[1:12:21] So, I want you to let you know, you
[1:12:23] don't need to be a preacher or a band
[1:12:25] member or a song leader or a deacon. You
[1:12:28] don't need to be that. Just be serving
[1:12:31] your purpose.
[1:12:32] Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] Be in the field. Look after the sheep.
[1:12:37] Because what you don't realize is this
[1:12:38] was prophecy spoken over you.
[1:12:41] This was God testifying that this is
[1:12:43] what's coming. This is going to be the
[1:12:45] next man that's coming.
[1:12:46] Saul didn't know this.
[1:12:50] So remember only after this and I'll
[1:12:52] give you some examples he kills Goliath.
[1:12:56] Then after that he marries the daughter
[1:12:59] after he had to go kill how many
[1:13:00] Philistines?
[1:13:01] 100.
[1:13:02] And how many did he kill?
[1:13:03] 200.
[1:13:04] 200. So hey I don't just go halfway. I
[1:13:07] bring you a double portion back. There
[1:13:09] was such an anointing on David because
[1:13:12] he was just in his position.
[1:13:17] But the testimony before he came to Saul
[1:13:19] and before he even fought Goliath,
[1:13:20] Goliath said, "You're not a man of war."
[1:13:24] But a simple servant knew what was lying
[1:13:28] in David.
[1:13:30] I'm telling you now, God knows what's
[1:13:32] lying within you.
[1:13:34] Tonight, may it anchor in that whatever
[1:13:36] you are busy with and it's in the name
[1:13:39] of the Lord. Keep doing it. Don't follow
[1:13:42] no one
[1:13:44] because he's building a believer. He's
[1:13:47] building your faith. He's building your
[1:13:49] character. So with David after that,
[1:13:52] Saul tries to kill him. Comes back from
[1:13:55] the the the war. They sing Saul killed
[1:13:59] his thousands. David killed 10,000. Saul
[1:14:02] gets jealous, try to kill him. He flees.
[1:14:05] Then he makes a very good friend
[1:14:07] Jonathan. And he loves Jonathan a lot.
[1:14:11] And then Saul tries to kill him again.
[1:14:15] So there's a lot of things that might
[1:14:17] happen in the church. There's a lot of
[1:14:19] things that might happen between
[1:14:20] believers, little things. But remember,
[1:14:23] it wasn't Saul that tried to kill him.
[1:14:26] Saul had an evil spirit on him. And the
[1:14:29] evil spirit wanted to kill him.
[1:14:31] So I'm telling you, there's evil. And
[1:14:33] I'm bringing it to a close.
[1:14:35] Musicians, you can come up.
[1:14:38] There's an evil spirit which is out
[1:14:40] there that says follow me.
[1:14:43] There's evil songs out there that says
[1:14:45] listen to me.
[1:14:47] Those things force themselves upon you
[1:14:51] and they want to take your time. They
[1:14:53] want to take your anointing. They want
[1:14:55] to take you out of the presence of God.
[1:14:59] Don't fall for it
[1:15:01] because remember Saul did not want to
[1:15:05] kill
[1:15:07] David, but there was something driving
[1:15:10] him to do it.
[1:15:11] Yeah.
[1:15:12] Because the spirit of the Lord left him.
[1:15:16] Now, I want to tell you when you flick,
[1:15:19] I'm talking to the band as well. You can
[1:15:21] have a look here before you play. When
[1:15:23] you flick
[1:15:25] and you follow,
[1:15:27] double click and like and all these
[1:15:29] things. I want to ask you, I actually
[1:15:32] double click something now. Let's shut
[1:15:34] it off.
[1:15:38] What are you following?
[1:15:40] And I want to ask you, where is it
[1:15:41] leading you?
[1:15:44] Can you discern this?
[1:15:47] Can you pray for the Lord to show you
[1:15:50] like he showed David?
[1:15:52] Cuz you know what? No matter how much
[1:15:53] mistakes David made, no matter how many
[1:15:55] battles he's fought, he always stood for
[1:15:58] God. He always was quick to repent.
[1:16:02] He was always willing to learn from his
[1:16:05] mistakes.
[1:16:07] He humbled himself. He started over.
[1:16:12] God never put him back on ABCs. You have
[1:16:14] to get baptized again and you have to
[1:16:16] No, he just left where he left God. God
[1:16:20] was waiting for him.
[1:16:22] And he goes, "Welcome back, David."
[1:16:23] Amen.
[1:16:24] Good to have you home.
[1:16:27] He says, "My sheep hear my voice.
[1:16:31] and no other will they follow. I want
[1:16:34] you to bow your head tonight. Let us bow
[1:16:36] our heads. If there's anybody here, I'm
[1:16:39] going to close my eyes too
[1:16:42] that is following
[1:16:44] and not following the Lord Jesus that
[1:16:47] has been distracted.
[1:16:49] I want to encourage you. The way you
[1:16:52] defy gravity, the way
[1:16:55] you break this thing upon you, this this
[1:16:58] yoke of the enemy that's trying to fool
[1:17:00] you and waste your time, the only way
[1:17:02] you can do it is by lifting up your
[1:17:05] hands and surrendering.
[1:17:09] See, I don't I don't I don't need an
[1:17:11] altar call now. I need you to be real
[1:17:14] with God. If you find yourself
[1:17:16] distracted, you find yourself following
[1:17:19] everything but God,
[1:17:22] and it's consuming your time. It's
[1:17:25] filling up your heart and it's breaking
[1:17:28] the anointing of God upon your life. The
[1:17:31] purpose of God for you.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:33] I ask you now,
[1:17:36] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:38] to lift up your hands and defy gravity
[1:17:42] and I will pray for you. Amenus.
[1:17:46] Lord Jesus,
[1:17:50] we've got hands lifted up.
[1:17:53] Father, we want to make you the all in
[1:17:55] our life. Lord, we want to follow you
[1:17:58] because Lord, your voice has called us
[1:18:00] in this day and we have responded, Lord,
[1:18:04] but we find, Lord, that distractions so
[1:18:06] easily come in, Lord, Lord, and that we
[1:18:09] find ourselves following things that's
[1:18:11] contrary to your word, Father, and
[1:18:14] that's occupying our minds, our hearts,
[1:18:17] Lord, and the time we spend with you,
[1:18:19] Father. And we want to come and lay this
[1:18:21] before you, Lord. Because as you chose
[1:18:24] David before the foundation of the world
[1:18:26] began, you predestinated him to be a
[1:18:29] giant slayer, Lord, to be an overcomer,
[1:18:32] Lord, to be the king of Israel. And no
[1:18:34] matter what happened, how many mistakes
[1:18:36] David made, how many times he might have
[1:18:38] felt like a a failure, Lord. We see it
[1:18:41] in the book of Psalms, Lord, how he just
[1:18:42] writes and says, "Oh God, have mercy
[1:18:44] upon me. My enemies come on me. Where
[1:18:47] else shall I turn my face? I turn my
[1:18:50] face towards you, Lord. You alone can
[1:18:52] save me right now. Hide me in your
[1:18:55] pavilion, Lord. Hide me under the shadow
[1:18:57] of the mighty. Lord, he knew when to get
[1:19:00] real with you. I pray that we get real
[1:19:03] with you. That this this every Wednesday
[1:19:06] and Sunday don't just become a
[1:19:08] following, Lord. Oh Lord, but we want
[1:19:11] you to step out of the pages of the word
[1:19:13] and touch our hearts, Lord, and renew a
[1:19:15] right spirit within us.
[1:19:18] Renew that spirit of God within us,
[1:19:20] Lord, and give us a clean heart, oh
[1:19:22] Lord,
[1:19:24] Father, because without you, we will go
[1:19:27] missing.
[1:19:29] We'll go lost like all the sheeps. And
[1:19:31] Father, sometimes you'll have to break
[1:19:34] the leg of a sheep to get them to
[1:19:37] listen.
[1:19:38] But tonight, we go, Lord,
[1:19:40] here we are.
[1:19:40] Here we are. And you found us. Just help
[1:19:43] us, Lord. Give us strength. Bless us in
[1:19:45] our place, Lord. May we not think that
[1:19:47] our gifts to you is not important. Lord,
[1:19:51] show us that what is our gifts and our
[1:19:53] callings upon this church, Lord. That we
[1:19:56] can add to your body, Lord, and walk
[1:19:58] with you, Lord, in newness of life.
[1:20:01] Father, I pray for every hand that was
[1:20:03] lifted up, Lord Jesus. You see what is
[1:20:06] within their hearts. You see their
[1:20:08] battles. I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:20:09] Christ that this thing would be broken
[1:20:11] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. If
[1:20:13] there's any spirit contrary to your Holy
[1:20:16] Spirit, hindering spirit, Lord, that's
[1:20:19] keeping them busy and wanting sons of
[1:20:22] God to fall and daughters of God to
[1:20:24] fall. I pray against that spirit in the
[1:20:27] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I
[1:20:29] rebuke that spirit, Lord, because you
[1:20:32] said that we have the authority. You
[1:20:34] gave us the authority, Lord, and you are
[1:20:36] the power before our authority. You said
[1:20:38] in my name, they shall cast out demons.
[1:20:41] in my name they shall lay their hands
[1:20:43] upon the sick and they shall recover.
[1:20:45] They that believe will do these things.
[1:20:48] We're a mighty force, Father, because we
[1:20:50] have the whole heaven, God himself
[1:20:53] behind us backing up his word and your
[1:20:56] word said it and we believe it. So if
[1:20:58] there is one spirit or any spirit
[1:21:00] contrary to your holy spirit, we adear
[1:21:03] it to leave in the name of our Lord
[1:21:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:21:08] It is done if you can believe it.
[1:21:09] Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] It is done if you could receive it in
[1:21:12] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:15] Like Jesus said, go and sin no more
[1:21:19] because today I would visit you and I
[1:21:22] would set you free and you will be from
[1:21:25] here on a victorious
[1:21:27] overcoming life testimony for his glory.
[1:21:32] I pray this in the name of our Lord
[1:21:33] Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Amen.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:45] You know how good the Lord is. He is
[1:21:47] just so good.
[1:21:50] Um, can we sing that Create in Me a
[1:21:52] Clean Heart? It's all right. Brother
[1:21:54] Liam, if you can put it up. Who loves
[1:21:57] the Lord?
[1:22:00] Just remember, there will always be two
[1:22:03] doors. There's always two doors.
[1:22:07] His way,
[1:22:09] your way.
[1:22:11] Sometimes we give too much credit to the
[1:22:13] devil. His way, your way.
[1:22:17] Where you going? Where do you want to
[1:22:19] end up? Hey, simple as that.
[1:22:22] Open the right door. Let's sing the
[1:22:23] song.
[1:22:25] We can all stand up.
[1:22:28] Create in me
[1:22:31] a clean
[1:22:34] heart.
[1:22:37] Oh
[1:22:39] God,
[1:22:44] and renew a right spirit
[1:22:49] within me. Oh, create in me a new Lord.
[1:22:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:58] Create
[1:23:00] me a new
[1:23:06] Oh
[1:23:09] God,
[1:23:14] and renew a right spirit
[1:23:19] within
[1:23:20] me.
[1:23:23] Cause me not away.
