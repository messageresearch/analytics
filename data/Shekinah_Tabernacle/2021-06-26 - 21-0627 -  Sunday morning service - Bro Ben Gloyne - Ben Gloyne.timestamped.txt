[3:15] [Music]
[4:40] so
[4:42] [Music]
[5:13] praise the lord good morning welcome to
[5:16] church this morning
[5:18] amen it's good to be here it's good to
[5:19] be in the presence of god and with
[5:22] believers that have a good spirit about
[5:23] them a nice warm spirit
[5:26] i like people with warm spirits
[5:29] i don't really gel with cold evil
[5:31] spirits very well
[5:34] i don't know why but birds have a
[5:36] feather flock together
[5:38] that's what they say you know and we're
[5:40] attracted to our own kind
[5:42] not that we're anything special but you
[5:44] know when you
[5:46] are filled with the spirit of god then
[5:48] you just like people that are filled
[5:50] with the same spirit you feel
[5:51] comfortable when you fellowship when you
[5:52] talk
[5:54] and even if you don't say anything if
[5:55] you notice that like even when you don't
[5:56] talk it's comfortable because
[5:58] you know there's not going to be any
[6:00] weird stuff coming out it's just nice
[6:02] stuff
[6:03] you know like like even work you know
[6:05] that's i
[6:07] i'm a bit um naughty these days i've
[6:10] been able to pick my employ
[6:11] my workmates for about 20 years and i
[6:14] just like
[6:15] i don't really like working with
[6:16] non-christians i just don't do it
[6:19] i know no no one has that i shouldn't
[6:21] say that i feel bad saying that but
[6:23] i just like working with christians you
[6:24] know people like easy for you to say
[6:28] i shouldn't say that i was thinking this
[6:30] morning
[6:33] but it is i mean it is true i it
[6:37] even if i work with a non-christian and
[6:39] we don't talk it's comfortable
[6:41] i just it's a nice atmosphere you know
[6:42] like but
[6:44] yeah i i find i find it hard to
[6:48] to have deep meaningful conversation
[6:50] with
[6:52] with people that don't really appreciate
[6:54] the things of god because it's hard to
[6:55] find
[6:56] you know you have to keep it on quite a
[6:57] shallow level and i'm not really
[6:59] into that but anyway
[7:04] um i was thinking this morning
[7:07] you know we i don't know if i'm getting
[7:09] old am i
[7:10] am i old
[7:14] because because brother andy and i joke
[7:16] around at work you know we joke around
[7:17] like we're old tradies you know we say
[7:19] i've been doing this for
[7:20] 20 years you know like the old but i've
[7:23] actually i was thinking this morning and
[7:24] i've actually been coming
[7:27] i've been coming to church faithfully
[7:30] for 20 years
[7:30] like week and week out week and week out
[7:34] and i thought lord it's been an honor to
[7:36] be able to do that for you
[7:37] to show lord i can't repay what you've
[7:39] done for me but at least i can show lord
[7:41] this is
[7:42] i'm very grateful for what you've done
[7:43] for me for your sacrifice for your
[7:46] the effort you've put them for me and
[7:47] the least i could do is put this effort
[7:49] back in for you
[7:50] you know so here we are here this
[7:52] morning and every one of you are putting
[7:54] in an effort for the lord
[7:55] and the lord sees it the lord's not just
[7:56] a person that doesn't
[7:58] recognize that you got up this morning
[8:00] and said lord i'm going to go and
[8:01] worship i'm going to serve you
[8:03] i'm going to do whatever i need to do
[8:04] the lord that's not lost on the lord we
[8:06] sometimes think he doesn't see those
[8:07] things he actually sees everything
[8:09] you know and he appreciates the effort
[8:11] that everyone puts in
[8:12] so the lord is pleased with your effort
[8:14] here this morning to
[8:16] to to be here so um um let some stand
[8:19] and we're going to enter into some
[8:21] worship and we're going to um
[8:23] just get ourselves into a place where we
[8:24] can receive the word of god and
[8:26] become changed people this morning who's
[8:28] looking forward to being changed
[8:31] you're going to be changed we're in the
[8:32] presence of a life-changing god this
[8:34] morning
[8:35] so we are going to be changed we're
[8:36] going to be better in about a few hours
[8:38] time we're going to be better than what
[8:39] we are now that's the way
[8:41] that's the way life works life grows
[8:43] death goes backwards but life goes
[8:45] forward so let's um
[8:46] let's um close our eyes and just commit
[8:48] the service to the lord heavenly father
[8:50] we're so grateful lord that
[8:52] for your keeping power in each one of
[8:53] our lives
[8:55] lord we understand from the bottom of
[8:57] our heart
[8:58] lord and from everything that's in us
[8:59] that that there's nothing good that
[9:02] we've done
[9:02] lord or that we've said or that
[9:05] that we could attain lord to or do to
[9:09] merit your mercy and your grace lord but
[9:11] we understand that it's only by your
[9:14] your hand of mercy lord that you've
[9:16] called each one of us
[9:18] lord it's on that basis that we come
[9:19] this morning knowing lord that
[9:21] this is your work lord i'm not my work
[9:24] but i'm your work
[9:25] lord i'm your workmanship and each one
[9:27] here is
[9:28] your workmanship lord jesus so we're so
[9:31] grateful of that lord and we just want
[9:32] to
[9:33] invite you into our midst this morning
[9:35] lord that that you would
[9:37] have full control in our service full
[9:40] control being lord that we
[9:42] we don't let our mind go to places where
[9:44] you wouldn't feel welcome or where
[9:45] it wouldn't welcome you lord because we
[9:48] know lord your
[9:49] it's more than just a natural realm that
[9:50] we deal in but it's a spiritual realm
[9:52] lord and may our
[9:54] may our spiritual lives this morning
[9:57] invite you into our presence lord
[9:58] forgive us of any sins we've committed
[10:00] lord anything that would that would stop
[10:03] our fellowship with you
[10:04] and would stop you from just dwelling
[10:07] peacefully with us lord jesus
[10:09] because we desire to always be at peace
[10:11] with you lord
[10:12] and as brother branham put it lord on

[24:42] motorbike if i got the right person yeah
[24:44] down the bottom

[24:50] you when i was maybe
[24:52] this big way way back in the day you
[24:53] know we used to go to um i think we used
[24:55] to head into cambridge
[24:57] and um maybe i was about six i think
[25:01] and i used to when i was during the
[25:03] service i thought that when i closed my
[25:04] eyes everyone else couldn't see you know
[25:06] so we were doing the songs and i thought
[25:08] when i i asked my brother i said can you
[25:11] ask
[25:11] tell me if you can see now and i'll
[25:14] close my eyes
[25:15] and he said i can still see i thought if
[25:17] i closed my eyes everyone else was
[25:18] it was all dark but i think i couldn't
[25:21] read that while maybe i was younger and
[25:23] but some other brother there would um he
[25:25] would always find me the words you know
[25:27] and then
[25:27] he would give me his book and point the
[25:29] song out and then i'd get it and then
[25:31] but i couldn't read it but i was like on
[25:32] the right words no yeah we're doing this
[25:34] and then
[25:35] the next song he'd do the same here
[25:36] because we had swap books and i don't
[25:38] know who that was but that was um
[25:39] it was in cambridge was a it was a
[25:41] little haul down by the
[25:42] river yeah heritage
[25:46] it's great to have a godly heritage you
[25:48] know we sometimes put all this effort

[41:34] everyone's had a good week everyone's
[41:36] well and rejoicing and um
[41:37] it's good to have everyone here praise
[41:40] the lord
[41:40] amen amen we're going to go to genesis
[41:43] chapter 3
[41:45] and then we're going to go to ephesians
[41:47] 2.
[41:49] so very familiar piece of scripture i'm
[41:52] sure to us
[41:53] all if he um genesis 3 and 1
[41:56] and we're going to read down to verse 8.
[42:00] so it says here now the serpent
[42:04] was more subtle than any beast of the
[42:06] field which the lord god had made
[42:08] he said unto the woman yea hath god said
[42:10] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[42:12] garden
[42:13] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[42:15] may eat
[42:16] of the tree of the fruits i mean sorry
[42:18] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[42:20] the garden
[42:21] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[42:23] the midst of the garden god hath said
[42:25] ye shall not eat it neither shall you
[42:27] touch at least you die
[42:28] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[42:31] shall surely not die
[42:33] for god doth know in that day ye eat
[42:35] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[42:37] and you shall be as gods known good and
[42:39] evil
[42:39] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[42:42] good for food and that it was
[42:44] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[42:46] desired to make one wise she took the
[42:48] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[42:50] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[42:52] and the eyes of them both were opened
[42:53] and they knew and they knew that they
[42:55] were naked and they sowed fig leaves
[42:57] together and made themselves aprons
[42:59] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[43:01] walking in the garden and the cool of
[43:03] the day
[43:04] and the and adam and his wife hid
[43:06] themselves from the presence of the lord
[43:08] god
[43:08] among the trees of the garden amen we're
[43:12] going to go to ephesians chapter 2
[43:14] uh verse 1 as well just for uh just a
[43:17] reading down to verse 7
[43:20] and then we're going to then you may
[43:22] have your seats here so
[43:24] ephesians 2 and 1
[43:35] and you have the quickened who are dead
[43:37] and trespasses and sins
[43:39] wherein in times past ye walked
[43:41] according to the course of this world
[43:43] according to the prince of the power of
[43:44] the ear
[43:45] the spirit that now worketh in the
[43:47] children of disobedience
[43:48] among uh among whom also we all had our
[43:52] conversation
[43:53] in times past and the lusts of our flesh
[43:55] the fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[43:57] and of the mind
[43:58] and we're by nature the children of
[44:00] wrath even as others
[44:01] but god who is rich in mercy amen i'm
[44:04] glad he's rich in mercy
[44:06] for his great lover and he loved us when
[44:08] we were dead and sins hath quickened us
[44:10] together with christ by grace
[44:12] ye are saved and hath raised us up
[44:15] together to make us sit together
[44:17] in heavenly places in christ jesus that
[44:20] in the ages to come he might show the
[44:22] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[44:24] kindness towards us
[44:25] through christ jesus amen
[44:28] so you may all have your seats this
[44:30] morning i just pray the lord would bless
[44:31] the reading of his word
[44:32] now i want to talk about the tactics of
[44:34] the serpent
[44:36] because we know the devil is a creature
[44:38] of habit what he did at the beginning
[44:40] he's still going to do right now and he
[44:41] will do until he's cast into the lake of
[44:43] fire
[44:43] now we so we have been looking through
[44:47] the past few services about how we're
[44:49] being made and as as you read there in
[44:51] ephesians 2
[44:52] that the lord has made us sit together
[44:54] in heavenly places in christ jesus which
[44:56] is our
[44:57] which is the believer's position in
[44:59] christ and from that position we have
[45:00] the authority
[45:01] to bind the devil to cast him out to
[45:03] take dominion over all of his works
[45:05] and that's the position that they that
[45:08] that the lord has placed us
[45:10] in so but you know there is always the
[45:13] enemy trying to drag us
[45:14] from that position and we can see his
[45:17] working here with
[45:18] with with eve that what he did is he as
[45:21] he is he isolated her
[45:23] uh by herself put question mark on the
[45:26] word
[45:26] uh appeal to her reasoning and then
[45:30] uh then and then it said that when she
[45:32] looked upon the tree for it to be
[45:33] desired to make one wise what's
[45:35] happening now she's anointing her
[45:36] emotional realm
[45:37] and then all that was done to drag her
[45:39] from her god-given position
[45:41] and this is what the devil does to you
[45:42] and i yeah right amen so we've got to be
[45:44] very
[45:44] aware of this that we're not ignorant to
[45:47] the devil's devices i mean because if he
[45:49] can blindside you he'll blindside you
[45:51] real good
[45:51] and he'll keep light signing you until
[45:53] god steps on the scene so
[45:55] you know we have as i said that we have
[45:58] our god ordained position which is in
[46:00] heavenly places in christ jesus
[46:02] and we are there in order to conquer
[46:05] every enemy to walk a victorious
[46:07] life in christ now we know the devil is
[46:11] has been a squatter in that position
[46:13] because he's in the heavenlies too but
[46:15] we're here to
[46:16] cast them out through the spirit of god
[46:18] and we have been given
[46:20] authority over every devil every
[46:22] sickness and every spirit of unbelief
[46:24] but that is not the only enemy we have
[46:26] dominion over
[46:28] because our greatest enemy is ourselves
[46:30] right so it's not just all of hell that
[46:32] should be under your feet your own will
[46:34] and your own ability should be under
[46:35] your feet as well
[46:37] amen because to me the greatest miracle
[46:39] jesus ever did
[46:40] was he he subjected his own body to
[46:43] god's will for his life i mean he went
[46:46] to calvary as a man with the sins of the
[46:47] world upon his shoulders
[46:49] amen to me that was that was the
[46:51] greatest miracle he ever did
[46:53] amen so so the so the serpent i mean the
[46:56] devil through the serpent
[46:58] used eve against herself in order to
[47:01] dethrone man from dwelling in heavenly
[47:03] places
[47:04] now we are here so so you say well but
[47:08] i've been restored back and i'm sitting
[47:09] in heavenly places in christ jesus i
[47:11] know my position
[47:13] now that may be true but that won't stop
[47:15] the devil from trying to drive you out
[47:16] of that position
[47:17] so that you're no longer operating by
[47:19] the spirit of god but you're living as a
[47:21] carnal believer now
[47:23] we read in romans 8 and 1 there is
[47:25] therefore no condemnation to them which
[47:27] are in christ jesus
[47:29] amen who walk not after the flesh but
[47:32] after the spirit so
[47:33] yes there's no condemnation to them
[47:35] which are in christ jesus but you've got
[47:36] to walk after the spirit
[47:38] not after the flesh but the but the
[47:40] devil wants you to walk in the flesh
[47:41] that's what he wants you to do
[47:43] i mean that's what his fixation is
[47:44] because he knows if you walk in your
[47:46] flesh he's got you
[47:48] i mean just like when the prophet was
[47:49] there and tommy osborne was a witness to
[47:51] it that maniac came up on the platform
[47:54] and you know you know he's a demon
[47:55] possessed man he already beaten up some
[47:57] other preachers and he came up there and
[47:58] he
[47:59] and he was threatening the prophet
[48:00] saying i'm going to tear you limb from
[48:01] limb and he got right in his face and he
[48:03] spat in his face and he's trying to why
[48:05] he's trying to get the prophet to go
[48:06] operate in a carnal way because remember
[48:08] brother brown was a trained boxer
[48:10] right but he knew this was not a spirit
[48:12] a fight against flesh and blood but this
[48:14] is demon powers coming to
[48:16] challenge the spirit of the living god
[48:18] and and so the prophet actually
[48:20] he actually felt sorry for the man and
[48:21] divine love projected
[48:23] hallelujah and then and then he you know
[48:25] and then that man was about to punch him
[48:27] but he said you know
[48:28] we'll see who's yo you know there's a
[48:30] challenge and
[48:32] um you know the prophet said you know
[48:33] you because you've challenged the spirit
[48:35] of god you're gonna fall at my feet
[48:36] and then that demon just said i'll show
[48:38] you who's gonna whose feet who's gonna
[48:39] fall over whose feet he wants to go
[48:41] punch him and he falls over and he
[48:42] pins the prophet's feet to the floor now
[48:45] if if brother brown tried to
[48:46] you know actually allow the devil to win
[48:48] that battle and get him into the flesh
[48:50] he would have been
[48:51] torn from limb and so this is the
[48:53] challenge that we face every day to walk
[48:56] after the
[48:56] spirit and not after the flesh amen
[48:59] because
[49:00] remember the biggest enemy we have is in
[49:02] have is you
[49:04] it's not lucifer it's not the demon over
[49:06] new zealand or the you know all the all
[49:08] the hordes of hell and
[49:09] you know the two thousand thousand
[49:11] demons have been released from the river
[49:12] euphrates or whatever that number is
[49:14] it's not them
[49:15] it's you remember they got whipped on
[49:17] calvary they already got been defeated
[49:20] jesus conquered hell death in the grave
[49:21] but now you've got to be conquered
[49:23] amen but it's your own choice it's your
[49:25] own human will
[49:27] it's it's it's what side you chose to
[49:30] yeah we're having church today how we're
[49:31] doing
[49:32] praise the lord now he says in perfect
[49:34] strength by perfect weakness he says
[49:36] there
[49:37] see we smother him out now now he's not
[49:39] talking about the devil talking about
[49:40] god here we drive him away
[49:42] from the poorest of us to the richest of
[49:44] us from the least to the greatest
[49:46] we keep god out of our lives because of
[49:48] our own selves
[49:50] i've often said the greatest enemy i got
[49:52] is william branham he's the one that
[49:53] gets in god's way
[49:55] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[49:57] that gets to play sometimes
[49:58] where he thinks he can do something
[50:00] about it
[50:02] you know that's the problem we get to a
[50:03] certain oh we're mature now now we can
[50:05] handle things because you know
[50:07] you know that's that's thinking you can
[50:08] do something about it
[50:10] and when he does he shoves god right out
[50:12] of the picture
[50:13] but when i can get rid of that guy when
[50:15] i can get to a place that he is out of
[50:17] the way then god can come
[50:19] over and do things that william branham
[50:20] knows nothing about
[50:22] that's when god can use you that's when
[50:24] he can use any of you
[50:26] he can use anybody when we get out of
[50:28] the way but as long as we've got
[50:29] ourselves in the way then he cannot
[50:32] so we gotta we're gonna get out of the
[50:34] way what's your job description to keep
[50:37] out of the way
[50:38] and let god have his way hallelujah but
[50:40] that's the challenge the devil doesn't
[50:42] want us to be kept out of the way
[50:44] he wants us to be carnal now
[50:47] you say well but i'm a sanctified holy
[50:50] ghost-filled believer
[50:51] we're still not exempt from these things
[50:53] you know we can allow people allow ill
[50:56] feelings
[50:56] jealousy insecurity unforgiveness
[50:59] towards anybody
[51:01] to rule them and that pushes god right
[51:04] out of the picture
[51:05] thinking that we know what we're doing
[51:06] because we are believers we've been down
[51:08] the road a bit that pushes him right
[51:10] out of the picture i mean but but why do
[51:13] those why do those feelings come up it's
[51:15] because the devil comes
[51:17] and he and what he does you know i was
[51:18] thinking about this
[51:20] you know we you know we read in um
[51:22] genesis
[51:23] where where before man begins to come on
[51:25] the picture it says and god made
[51:27] heavens and earth and that word means
[51:29] elohim the self-existing one
[51:31] but when man is about to come on the
[51:32] scene it says and the lord god
[51:34] made and that means the self-existing
[51:37] one who reveals himself
[51:38] so now he's got someone who's coming to
[51:40] the picture he can have a relationship
[51:42] with he can talk with he can walk with
[51:44] he can
[51:44] reveal his you know his heart who he is
[51:46] too that's man
[51:48] but then when the serpent comes along he
[51:50] says yay hath god said
[51:52] so he's trying to get eve to think now
[51:54] god is some distant somebody
[51:56] that doesn't care about her or is even
[51:59] conscious of what is going on
[52:00] and i was thinking what kind of lives
[52:03] would we live
[52:04] if we were conscious god was always
[52:06] worth us every moment of every day
[52:08] i'm talking about in our secret little
[52:10] chambers where it's just it's just
[52:11] you and your whatever you do you know
[52:14] would you talk differently
[52:15] uh to people or about people if your
[52:18] conscious god was right there
[52:19] because he's there right he's not some
[52:22] distance somewhere on the other side of
[52:23] somewhere
[52:24] so many billion light years away he's
[52:26] not he's he he's here
[52:28] right so i wonder if we would talk
[52:29] differently about each other or even
[52:32] people in the world or you know and then
[52:34] brother brown even got told by the angel
[52:36] lord
[52:37] your thoughts speak louder and heavier
[52:39] than your words
[52:40] so i was wondering if we were really
[52:41] conscious of that would we let our minds
[52:44] just mereander along some garden path
[52:46] somewhere
[52:47] the devil takes us on some crazy boat
[52:49] right you know in our thought pattern
[52:52] what do we think that way if we're
[52:53] conscious god knows all about it
[52:56] i think i think our lives would kind of
[52:58] change a little bit
[52:59] don't you know if we're really conscious
[53:00] god he's right there
[53:03] he knows everything you do hallelujah
[53:07] amen and i to me i think that's
[53:09] wonderful i'm glad we don't serve some
[53:10] distant god somewhere
[53:11] who's not interested in you and i he's
[53:13] very interested his whole
[53:15] his whole focus is on the bride of
[53:16] christ getting us ready to leave this
[53:18] world
[53:20] hallelujah so i think you know our lives
[53:22] would be
[53:23] very much different but you see the
[53:27] you know the devil through the serpent
[53:29] got eve to believe that because she said
[53:31] no but god has said she didn't say the
[53:34] lord god has said she said god is said
[53:35] so she was
[53:36] agreeing with what the revelation the
[53:39] serpent was giving her
[53:41] and so she was also isolated from her
[53:44] husband
[53:45] you know we can be living in a house you
[53:47] can be actually in a church like this
[53:48] and be
[53:49] isolated you know don't really
[53:53] talk to anyone connect with anyone have
[53:55] a real friendship you know
[53:56] you can be an individual you know
[53:58] families sadly these days are a bunch of
[54:00] individuals in a house
[54:02] there's no real connection going on and
[54:05] what's that
[54:06] you're isolated now and then he begins
[54:08] to put a question mark on the word
[54:10] and that's what the devil always done
[54:12] you know you see all these
[54:13] websites and parasites and things online
[54:15] that's always question question question
[54:17] question
[54:18] you know it's all questions and that's
[54:20] like the serpent yay hath god said is it
[54:21] really true does this really happen to
[54:23] this really do
[54:24] and i came to the conclusion i don't
[54:26] have to go back to the holy land
[54:28] and dig down to find where abraham was i
[54:30] don't have to go to egypt and find out
[54:32] where the
[54:32] children of israel were i don't have to
[54:34] go to iraq to the era of the chaldees
[54:36] and find out where his
[54:37] you know papa was from abraham i don't
[54:39] have to go i don't have to go where paul
[54:41] was to believe that paul preached and he
[54:42] was in prison and there he was
[54:44] i don't have to go there right i don't
[54:47] have to go to america and see
[54:48] jeffersonville and all i don't have to
[54:50] go and see
[54:50] whatever god did through history to
[54:52] really believe it
[54:53] he reveals his word and you believe it
[54:56] because you see it manifesting in your
[54:57] life
[54:58] that's the proof of the pudding right
[55:00] but the devil says did it really happen
[55:01] well i know this word is true because it
[55:03] lives in my life
[55:04] i believe the whole word of god because
[55:05] god did something to my life i met the
[55:07] author of the book
[55:08] hallelujah so the biggest challenges
[55:10] that he was is yay hath god said
[55:13] is it really the truth well it's
[55:15] vindicated itself
[55:16] and i can just say these little four
[55:18] walls here it's proven itself
[55:20] hallelujah and then now
[55:24] she then when when he opened when she
[55:27] opened
[55:28] her mind to him his reasoning then
[55:31] she then he appealed to her emotions
[55:35] and that's why a thought comes into your
[55:37] mind some ill feeling comes up what's
[55:39] already happened the devil's already
[55:41] already appealed to your mind you've
[55:43] agreed with the thought that the emotion
[55:45] comes up you grab a hold of it
[55:48] and then what happens you're carnal
[55:52] and this is all the way through well
[55:54] this is us hello
[55:55] you know maybe i'm just preaching about
[55:57] myself you know i don't know
[55:58] but let's take off our angel wings and
[56:00] you know here we are but we're in this
[56:02] real battle right but we've been given
[56:04] overcoming power
[56:05] i mean to break the cycle of the devil
[56:07] what we don't have to listen to is
[56:09] nonsense anymore
[56:10] but we can discern and withstand the
[56:12] antichrist spirit in our midst
[56:14] hallelujah amen because i want to sit in
[56:18] heavenly places and i want to
[56:19] you know i want to manifest what jesus
[56:22] purchased on calvary
[56:23] he went through i think brother isaac
[56:25] said he went through a lot of effort
[56:27] i mean to redeem me so much i'll live
[56:29] out his victory
[56:30] don't you think so i mean so now we are
[56:33] called not to
[56:34] walk in a carnal way but to walk after
[56:37] the spirit now if you think about
[56:38] walking after the spirit
[56:40] then therefore if we walk after the
[56:42] spirit all things are possible
[56:44] now brother brown had a um
[56:48] if i could find it here he had a lady
[56:50] come up in the prayer line
[56:53] and she she had a deaf spirit on her
[56:58] and he says here oh can i find it
[57:03] let me find this good old technology
[57:07] but she has a deaf spirit on her and
[57:08] she's come come
[57:10] forward for prayer
[57:14] he says it at thy word in 51 but just
[57:17] have faith now believe that god is
[57:19] and there is a rewarder of those who
[57:21] diligently seek him you believe that
[57:23] with all your heart all right
[57:24] now i see right now it's in her ears
[57:27] she's she's got a deaf spirit on her
[57:29] almighty god author of life and giver of
[57:31] every good
[57:32] gift send thy blessings upon this woman
[57:34] and healer
[57:36] thou art here lord and this devil knows
[57:38] that his time has come
[57:40] to this woman entering into the sphere
[57:43] of faith here he knows he's got to lose
[57:46] he can't hold her
[57:48] any longer so she was stepping into a
[57:51] sphere of faith
[57:52] and because it and the devil knows when
[57:54] everyone steps into that kind of realm
[57:56] he has to let go his time has come i
[57:59] mean so how would it be this morning or
[58:01] actually for the every moment for the
[58:03] rest of the rest of our lives
[58:05] if we just lived in that sphere of faith
[58:07] not of a sphere of ill feeling and
[58:09] resentment and
[58:10] grudges and unforgiveness uncertainty
[58:12] but it's fear which is unbelief all that
[58:14] but a sphere of faith amen where
[58:17] wherever we step into that
[58:18] into that realm the devil knows he can't
[58:21] hold you any longer
[58:22] hallelujah and this is the kind of place
[58:25] we're ordained to live in
[58:27] amen this is actually our address as a
[58:29] sphere of faith i mean that's why jesus
[58:32] died
[58:32] amen that a people would be lifted back
[58:34] up into heavenly places in christ jesus
[58:36] where adam and eve fell from i mean
[58:38] they'd operate by faith they wouldn't
[58:40] operate by faith
[58:41] i mean by sight but by faith hallelujah
[58:45] but imagine if we're living in that kind
[58:46] of sphere of faith right now
[58:49] hallelujah and you don't have to imagine
[58:51] it no it's our portion
[58:53] hallelujah where the devil's got to let
[58:55] go he can't be there any longer
[58:58] hallelujah they say well does it really
[59:00] matter about
[59:02] about what can happen based on how i
[59:04] feel or what i'm doing well
[59:06] i tell you jesus went back to nazareth
[59:09] and it says in matthew 13 he said he
[59:12] couldn't do many mighty miracles there
[59:13] he couldn't do many miracles there
[59:15] because their unbelief
[59:16] and they were astonished they were
[59:18] offended
[59:20] because they began to ask questions is
[59:22] this not the carpenter's son
[59:24] is not his mother called mary these are
[59:26] his brethren you know james and joseph
[59:28] simon and judas
[59:29] and his sisters are they not all with us
[59:31] whence has this man
[59:33] all these things and they were offended
[59:35] in him
[59:36] but jesus said unto them a prophet is
[59:38] not without honor saving his own country
[59:40] and saving his own house
[59:42] and they and he did not many mighty
[59:43] works there because of their unbelief
[59:46] they were offended at the fulfillment of
[59:49] the messiah
[59:49] not at the idea of the messiah i doubt
[59:51] very much if we went there before jesus
[59:53] was ever born
[59:54] and and we asked the question the
[59:56] messiah is coming that's a praise
[59:58] praise jehovah god we're excited to see
[1:00:00] him you know look at these scriptures
[1:00:01] they get all excited about the prophecy
[1:00:03] but the fulfillment offended them and
[1:00:06] it's always the way through history as
[1:00:08] the fulfillment of scripture that
[1:00:09] offends the people
[1:00:10] not the idea behind it or the prophecy
[1:00:12] behind it is the fulfillment
[1:00:14] amen but because they took him to you
[1:00:17] know they
[1:00:17] they only saw his natural side as
[1:00:19] naturals family sign
[1:00:21] they were offended in him in the idea of
[1:00:23] him being the messiah
[1:00:24] and their unbelief hindered him that he
[1:00:27] could not do many mighty couldn't do
[1:00:28] many miracles there
[1:00:30] that was a sphere of unbelief but if we
[1:00:33] can get us
[1:00:33] into a sphere of faith where all things
[1:00:36] are possible
[1:00:36] amen to this problem that we face you
[1:00:38] know this devil that's fighting
[1:00:39] tormenting us he's got to let go
[1:00:41] we don't have to put up with him no
[1:00:43] longer amen by their faith amen will
[1:00:45] drive him away
[1:00:47] hallelujah amen
[1:00:50] now amen so this is basically where i'm
[1:00:55] going
[1:00:56] um you know the
[1:01:00] scripture i mean brother braham says
[1:01:01] here speaking about
[1:01:04] he says the devil's always trying to
[1:01:06] point out to somebody's failure
[1:01:08] but he tries to keep you away from the
[1:01:11] real testimony that's genuine
[1:01:13] why is that because that would build
[1:01:14] faith that's why always points to the
[1:01:16] failure
[1:01:17] he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime
[1:01:19] who went out impersonating something
[1:01:21] he didn't he didn't do it because he was
[1:01:23] impersonating but if it
[1:01:25] come from the true source of the word of
[1:01:27] god heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:01:28] my word cannot pass away
[1:01:30] it's got to stay there he says you see
[1:01:32] it says it must be accepted in the mind
[1:01:35] then believed in the heart then the word
[1:01:37] of god becomes a reality
[1:01:39] then every every senses of soul and body
[1:01:41] as a spirit and body
[1:01:43] as you scout out with the holy spirit
[1:01:45] then your sense of god your conscience
[1:01:47] of god
[1:01:47] everything that's godly flows through
[1:01:49] you there's not a doubt anywhere there's
[1:01:51] nothing can rise up
[1:01:52] there's nothing that can come up in the
[1:01:54] memory and say well i remember miss
[1:01:56] jones tried to trust god i missed so and
[1:01:58] so
[1:01:59] missed though tried to trust god for
[1:02:01] healing sometime and she failed what is
[1:02:03] that that's the tactics of the serpent
[1:02:05] this person tried and they failed
[1:02:08] so what's that reasoning against the
[1:02:10] word of god and then a bit of ill
[1:02:12] feeling unbelief comes up that feeling
[1:02:14] that a wall goes up
[1:02:16] what's that why because it's it's it's
[1:02:18] the devil engaging into
[1:02:19] our emotional realm but if that
[1:02:22] channel's been cleared out and being
[1:02:24] purged and be filled on the inside with
[1:02:25] the holy spirit
[1:02:27] that don't even come in memory no matter
[1:02:29] about miss jones and what she did it's
[1:02:30] you and god together
[1:02:32] nobody else but you too there you are
[1:02:34] there's your battle kill him at the
[1:02:36] beginning what's that don't even listen
[1:02:37] to his lies
[1:02:39] i mean stop him dead in his track it
[1:02:41] ain't how long you can make the law
[1:02:44] make the war linger it stop it right
[1:02:47] now amen we don't have to let this thing
[1:02:49] drag on you can stop it right now
[1:02:52] this has got to come to an end
[1:02:54] hallelujah romans 12 1 says i beseech
[1:02:56] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[1:02:58] god
[1:02:58] that you present your bodies a living
[1:03:00] sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god
[1:03:03] which is your reasonable service i mean
[1:03:06] so we are called to
[1:03:08] continually be a living sacrifice on his
[1:03:11] altar
[1:03:13] amen it's not a one-time thing it's a
[1:03:16] daily living in the presence of the king
[1:03:18] you know some people think i'll just
[1:03:19] have a one-and-done experience at camp
[1:03:20] you gotta keep walking with god
[1:03:22] we need a fresh experience amen amen we
[1:03:25] cannot live
[1:03:26] on the past we're gonna live in the
[1:03:28] present
[1:03:29] amen we were continually living in the
[1:03:31] presence of the king
[1:03:33] where because this word should never
[1:03:34] become common this is how i say this how
[1:03:36] you kind of know that you're trying to
[1:03:38] live off a past experience the word
[1:03:39] becomes common
[1:03:40] it doesn't excite you anymore you just
[1:03:42] go through the motions that's you know
[1:03:44] we're not called to have that kind of
[1:03:45] walk you know
[1:03:46] you know a honeymoon should never end
[1:03:49] between a husband and wife that
[1:03:51] honeymoon phase should never end in
[1:03:53] spite of all the busyness of life and
[1:03:55] children all these things
[1:03:56] you should still have that freshness
[1:03:57] about your relationship it should be
[1:03:58] still wonderful and you should
[1:04:00] appreciate them and
[1:04:01] you know that's how it should be with
[1:04:02] the lord too hallelujah
[1:04:04] and he says in the next verse be not
[1:04:07] conformed to this world
[1:04:08] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:04:10] your mind that ye may
[1:04:12] prove that what is that good and
[1:04:14] acceptable
[1:04:15] and perfect will of god so we are called
[1:04:18] not to be conformed to this world or
[1:04:20] this world's order
[1:04:22] which is its way of thinking so what is
[1:04:24] the world full of today
[1:04:26] selfishness it's all about me it's the
[1:04:29] age of the selfie
[1:04:31] right it's the era of the cult of self
[1:04:35] where people worship themselves remember
[1:04:37] the scripture says you come in the end
[1:04:39] time
[1:04:40] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:04:41] god so they'll be religious but they'll
[1:04:44] worship themselves in their own
[1:04:45] pleasures more than they'll worship god
[1:04:47] new clothes new car new phone new
[1:04:49] renovations new holiday me me me
[1:04:52] now what does that breed jealousy
[1:04:55] people become unhappy when others do
[1:04:58] well in life
[1:04:59] and it produces insecurity because of
[1:05:02] people always comparing themselves with
[1:05:04] themselves which is
[1:05:06] which the scripture says is unwise
[1:05:09] right comparing their children with
[1:05:11] other children comparing their churches
[1:05:12] with other churches
[1:05:13] discontentment uh which is produced i
[1:05:17] mean
[1:05:18] it's really from discontentment but the
[1:05:20] scripture tells us to be con
[1:05:22] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:05:25] i want great gain don't you
[1:05:26] hallelujah so that's what happens now
[1:05:29] this is the age we're living in but the
[1:05:30] apostle paul says do not be conformed to
[1:05:32] this world
[1:05:34] so don't don't don't be trapped into
[1:05:35] this thought pattern this is not you
[1:05:37] know if
[1:05:38] if you're thinking like this that's a
[1:05:39] carnal way it's not a spiritual way
[1:05:45] so we shouldn't be conformed to that but
[1:05:48] but then we begin if you ever really
[1:05:50] begin to think about what the lord has
[1:05:51] done
[1:05:52] hallelujah you really think about what
[1:05:54] he's done for you in your life
[1:05:56] amen wasn't it he that saved you by his
[1:05:58] grace
[1:05:59] washed you by his grace transformed you
[1:06:01] by his grace
[1:06:02] set your feet on the king's highway that
[1:06:04] leads you up to glory by his grace has
[1:06:06] he done that
[1:06:07] i mean when you begin to think on those
[1:06:09] things i mean it's no longer the you
[1:06:11] know
[1:06:11] you know to me that renews your mind
[1:06:14] lord you've given me another day
[1:06:16] hallelujah you're still alive you've
[1:06:18] done all this for me and lord what's
[1:06:20] what's today going to bring
[1:06:22] and then everything else around you just
[1:06:24] kind of fades away
[1:06:25] you don't care about how much money
[1:06:27] you've got in the bank who cares about
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:29] or your clothes if then you're old or
[1:06:31] whatever you know you're not too worried
[1:06:32] about those kind of things
[1:06:34] i mean because he is everything
[1:06:37] amen i love this quote from mighty
[1:06:39] conqueror brother tazowa brought it out
[1:06:40] at camp he says man was refused from
[1:06:42] men was refused from heaven now as i say
[1:06:45] think about what the law has done for
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:47] the highways was closed there was no
[1:06:49] highway
[1:06:50] but where there was no highway he came
[1:06:52] to make one
[1:06:54] oh my the first line was demons of doubt
[1:06:57] the next was prejudice the next was
[1:07:00] selfishness
[1:07:01] this earth was covered all over with
[1:07:03] lines of demon power
[1:07:04] then sickness diseases but when he began
[1:07:07] to ascend up to heaven
[1:07:09] last night we adam coming out of hell
[1:07:10] with the keys of death and hell on the
[1:07:12] side
[1:07:12] this morning we're taking him up
[1:07:14] hallelujah when he rose he was triumph
[1:07:17] and as he went up he broke through every
[1:07:19] demon power that holds over man
[1:07:21] he ascended on high and give gifts to
[1:07:23] man the gifts of the holy spirit the
[1:07:25] mighty conqueror
[1:07:26] he stands alone this morning and between
[1:07:28] him and every believer
[1:07:29] is the blessed old highway of holiness
[1:07:31] that the righteous walk
[1:07:33] shall walk on there is not a way of
[1:07:35] escape
[1:07:36] there is only one one line cut down from
[1:07:39] glory
[1:07:40] he left the bloody footprints as he
[1:07:42] walked through the corridors of demon
[1:07:43] powers and made a highway for us
[1:07:45] all the way through he sits on high this
[1:07:47] morning as the mighty conqueror
[1:07:49] i mean so for you and i he cut through
[1:07:51] all unbelief superstitions resentment
[1:07:54] amen all demon power sickness unbelief
[1:07:56] prejudice he cut through all those
[1:07:58] things
[1:07:58] he said my son and my daughter i want
[1:08:00] you to walk up this way
[1:08:01] amen from earth to glory hallelujah he
[1:08:04] did that for you and i
[1:08:05] amen you just think about what he did is
[1:08:08] it incredible
[1:08:09] oh my he's done so very much for me i
[1:08:11] cannot tell at all
[1:08:13] hallelujah amen
[1:08:16] amen first corinthians tells us i
[1:08:18] protest by your rejoicing which i have
[1:08:20] in christ jesus our lord
[1:08:22] i die daily the apostle paul says amen
[1:08:25] then he says if after the manner of men
[1:08:27] i have fought with the beast of ephesus
[1:08:29] what advantages at me if the dead rise
[1:08:32] not let us eat and drink for tomorrow we
[1:08:34] die
[1:08:35] be not deceived evil communications
[1:08:38] corrupt
[1:08:38] good manners now many times we think of
[1:08:41] this evil communications corrupting good
[1:08:43] manners there's actually
[1:08:44] a bad influence in the world coming in
[1:08:46] and corrupting us
[1:08:47] which happens right you can't put rotten
[1:08:51] apples with good apples in the same
[1:08:52] basket and expect the good apples to
[1:08:54] fix the bad apples but in reality it's
[1:08:57] not that well
[1:08:58] that is true in one sense but in the
[1:09:00] other sense it's actually
[1:09:01] the corruption of good manners from the
[1:09:04] evil communication is actually out of
[1:09:06] the believer
[1:09:07] themselves now this word evil i'm just
[1:09:11] going to throw some dictionary
[1:09:12] definitions at you
[1:09:13] from the thais this is the bible
[1:09:15] dictionary he says
[1:09:16] evil is of a good nature i mean i'm
[1:09:20] sorry of a bad nature
[1:09:22] it's it's a mode of thinking feeling or
[1:09:24] acting that's what the devil wants you
[1:09:26] to do
[1:09:26] feel in a bad way think in a bad way act
[1:09:29] in a bad way
[1:09:31] i mean it's troublesome it's destructive
[1:09:33] and it's injurious
[1:09:35] now this word corrupt it means to
[1:09:38] corrupt or to destroy
[1:09:40] but it has another meaning which means
[1:09:42] to lead away a christian
[1:09:44] church from that state of knowledge and
[1:09:46] holiness in which it ought to be
[1:09:48] or to abide now i'm bringing this down
[1:09:51] to the individual
[1:09:53] right so now a man could interpret
[1:09:56] holiness by length of dress
[1:09:58] or how loose loose clothing is or
[1:10:00] modesty in that way but people can dress
[1:10:02] all the right way but have a temper to
[1:10:04] fight a buzzsaw
[1:10:05] and they'll take them all on at once
[1:10:07] right so real holiness comes from the
[1:10:09] inside out
[1:10:11] true it is there from the outside with
[1:10:13] modest dressing but it's really a
[1:10:14] cleansed and pure heart
[1:10:16] that thinks no evil holds no malice
[1:10:18] holds no grudges or resentment or
[1:10:19] unbelief
[1:10:20] right so and then our manners it says as
[1:10:24] a moral habits
[1:10:26] now putting all this together i could
[1:10:28] say first corinthians 15 33 says be not
[1:10:31] deceived
[1:10:32] but communicating or speaking bad
[1:10:35] natured troublesome
[1:10:36] things that injure and destroy a person
[1:10:39] will cause the person that does this to
[1:10:41] be led away from a true state of
[1:10:43] knowledge and holiness
[1:10:44] and become corrupted that they're no
[1:10:46] longer pure in their heart yet still
[1:10:48] professing to serve god
[1:10:51] so it's really you know it's it's those
[1:10:53] things they corrupt the person doing
[1:10:55] them
[1:10:56] but someone who's always making snide
[1:10:58] them snide remarks tearing people down
[1:11:00] saying negative things about people
[1:11:02] that's evil communication
[1:11:04] and it doesn't just hurt the person that
[1:11:06] it's being sent at
[1:11:07] but it's hurting the person it comes out
[1:11:09] of amen so we don't
[1:11:11] but the devil's tactic is to get us into
[1:11:13] that kind of carnal state
[1:11:17] so we don't want to ever go down that
[1:11:19] way
[1:11:20] amen but it should be so that's why he
[1:11:22] says don't be deceived be not deceived
[1:11:24] evil communications corrupt good manners
[1:11:29] i think i've got everyone's attention
[1:11:30] just about now hello but you see that's
[1:11:32] the thing is we can walk in a carnal
[1:11:34] state where god can't use us like he
[1:11:35] wants to use
[1:11:36] us because the devil the devil speaks to
[1:11:39] our mind
[1:11:40] gets our emotions makes us agree with
[1:11:42] those because i'm feeling this way so it
[1:11:44] must be real
[1:11:45] right you know all this memory so alive
[1:11:48] because it's made me feel the certain
[1:11:49] way it takes me back there
[1:11:50] the devil takes you back there because
[1:11:52] he's trying to get you dragged down into
[1:11:53] a carnal state
[1:11:55] i mean what then what happens is that
[1:11:56] now god can't work through us anymore
[1:11:59] and we're just a carnal believer we're
[1:12:00] not called to be in this kind of state
[1:12:04] you know it's amazing how a
[1:12:06] misunderstanding can snowball into a big
[1:12:08] thing
[1:12:09] brother braham says in the everlasting
[1:12:11] life and how to receive it
[1:12:12] he said it could be it could be
[1:12:14] psychology you say do you see that there
[1:12:16] and you keep saying yes i believe it
[1:12:19] and believe it so much till actually you
[1:12:21] think you see it then you don't see
[1:12:23] that's right but that's psychology but
[1:12:25] uh if you just get so mentally pressed
[1:12:27] towards it till you just imagine it
[1:12:30] so imagine it so much till it becomes
[1:12:32] reality you just imagine somebody hates
[1:12:34] you once and they don't hate you
[1:12:37] but you imagine they do and and you just
[1:12:39] keep thinking they don't like me
[1:12:41] and the first thing you'll be shunning
[1:12:43] that person when they haven't done
[1:12:45] nothing to you
[1:12:46] now what's happened now is there's been
[1:12:48] a misunderstanding the devil plays on
[1:12:50] that misunderstanding so
[1:12:52] that person don't like you and and it's
[1:12:54] you know they oh that person doesn't
[1:12:55] like me
[1:12:56] and then you feel you know insecure
[1:12:59] and you're in your word and so the devil
[1:13:01] takes your feelings
[1:13:03] and basically writes those things and
[1:13:04] makes you act a totally
[1:13:06] way actually makes you act a way that's
[1:13:08] totally contrary to reality
[1:13:12] and after a while it becomes so a
[1:13:14] reality to you
[1:13:15] till you actually believe that person
[1:13:17] doesn't like you
[1:13:18] and you'll might ball them out or say
[1:13:21] something
[1:13:22] or say something to you for instance
[1:13:23] your wife or your husband or some
[1:13:25] neighbor or something like that
[1:13:26] when the person is absolutely innocent
[1:13:29] of any ill thing
[1:13:30] it's because you just imagine it so till
[1:13:33] it become
[1:13:33] a reality to you you see what i mean
[1:13:37] see this is this is a trap that we can
[1:13:39] come into our brother so-and-so didn't
[1:13:41] shake my hand
[1:13:42] three sundays in a row this happened or
[1:13:44] you know brother cabin's always sitting
[1:13:45] in the back
[1:13:46] i think he doesn't like me the devil
[1:13:49] could play on that
[1:13:50] i can say that because he's my buddy you
[1:13:52] know but you know the devil could play
[1:13:53] on that
[1:13:54] or look at these brothers behind the
[1:13:55] sounders they're always behind the sound
[1:13:57] disc
[1:13:57] they're not interested in what's going
[1:13:58] on the devil could play on that you say
[1:14:00] well that's ridiculous
[1:14:01] that's how ridiculous some people get
[1:14:03] trapped into
[1:14:05] you know so we never ever you know we
[1:14:07] don't want
[1:14:08] you know as as jesus would say a little
[1:14:10] levin
[1:14:11] living with the whole lump so i'm going
[1:14:13] to start with just a little
[1:14:14] insignificant thing but it'll change and
[1:14:16] you think about yeast it changes the
[1:14:17] whole structure and chemistry of the
[1:14:18] bread
[1:14:20] the whole thing gets changed by just a
[1:14:21] little powder that's kind of sprinkled
[1:14:23] in or activated a certain way
[1:14:25] and it's the same thing with this it can
[1:14:26] change your whole your whole demeanor
[1:14:28] how you
[1:14:29] how you speak how you act can change
[1:14:31] because all that person's here
[1:14:33] and they're just happy praising god and
[1:14:35] everything's one they have no idea
[1:14:36] what's going on but in your mind
[1:14:37] it's this big thing and what's that the
[1:14:41] devil
[1:14:41] using your emotions and your and your
[1:14:43] reasoning to tear you down
[1:14:45] and become a carnal person
[1:14:48] you know we should who forgives everyone
[1:14:51] in this room
[1:14:52] let's just let go of everything right
[1:14:54] now whatever the past is
[1:14:56] forgetting the things that you're in the
[1:14:58] past let's just forget it we're pressing
[1:15:00] on
[1:15:01] oh what about last week i can't what
[1:15:03] happened last week i don't know
[1:15:05] what about last year is that so far what
[1:15:08] happened i don't know
[1:15:09] but that person did that what do you
[1:15:11] mean amen so our years got a goldfish
[1:15:13] memory no no
[1:15:14] the blood of jesus christ can come into
[1:15:17] your life in such a way that you cannot
[1:15:18] hold anything against anybody
[1:15:20] jesus said father forgive them they
[1:15:22] don't know what they do and if you look
[1:15:24] at the
[1:15:24] case you say no they planned this they
[1:15:26] orchestrated it
[1:15:27] they were waiting for the right man to
[1:15:29] come which was judas to you know find
[1:15:30] out where he is and go secretly and
[1:15:32] you know they planned the whole thing
[1:15:34] they knew what they were doing they
[1:15:35] thought
[1:15:36] but they didn't really know he was the
[1:15:37] prince of life but you know the lord can
[1:15:40] move in your life and such and this is
[1:15:41] not pie in the sky
[1:15:43] you know you know perfect faith is based
[1:15:46] on forgiveness
[1:15:48] you read that about you if you stand to
[1:15:49] this mountain you know when you're
[1:15:50] standing pray forgive
[1:15:52] jesus says so let's just forget about
[1:15:55] you know can we can we do that i forgive
[1:15:58] brother
[1:15:59] all these people hold nothing against
[1:16:01] them amen
[1:16:03] hallelujah we want to
[1:16:06] walk into a sphere of faith where the
[1:16:08] devil has to go
[1:16:11] hallelujah but you see now it can be
[1:16:16] the world we live in god wasn't
[1:16:19] panicking when he made ladies here
[1:16:21] or when he allowed ladies here to come
[1:16:24] he wasn't panicking that as bright as
[1:16:25] she going to make it through
[1:16:28] right he wasn't he's not stressing his
[1:16:31] blood pressure hasn't gone through the
[1:16:32] roof
[1:16:33] he's not got panic attacks in heaven
[1:16:35] he's not in a state of emergency
[1:16:37] he knows that his salvation is strong
[1:16:41] enough
[1:16:42] and the devil does not have enough to to
[1:16:44] defeat the bride of christ in this hour
[1:16:47] he knows that the devil cannot win
[1:16:50] because he's seen to the end of the book
[1:16:51] he's seen all the way through time and
[1:16:53] then when time is no more and
[1:16:54] eternity rolls on so do you think he's
[1:16:56] panicking no
[1:16:57] do you think he's worried about the
[1:16:59] devil's devices no why because he's
[1:17:01] equipped us
[1:17:02] with the with the right weapon and armor
[1:17:05] to defeat the devil anytime anyplace
[1:17:07] anywhere
[1:17:07] you know the prophet said this end time
[1:17:09] message meets end-time conditions
[1:17:11] i mean so whatever condition the end
[1:17:13] time is in right now this message meets
[1:17:15] this condition
[1:17:16] i mean the word we have received is far
[1:17:18] greater
[1:17:19] than the devil's tactics his
[1:17:21] psychological warfare
[1:17:22] his propaganda you know when he comes
[1:17:24] along and says it ain't gonna happen
[1:17:26] it cannot happen they're never coming
[1:17:28] back and you could just ask him do you
[1:17:30] know the future devil
[1:17:32] that's right he don't know the future
[1:17:34] he's got his algorithms and projects a
[1:17:37] few forecasts but you know he's like a
[1:17:38] weather man
[1:17:40] maybe a bit better than the weatherman
[1:17:41] sometimes but you know he's kind of
[1:17:42] thinking oh if this happens i can get
[1:17:43] this to happen
[1:17:44] but he's just projecting things he has
[1:17:47] his goal but he doesn't really you know
[1:17:48] he's got plans but he doesn't know the
[1:17:50] future so we could really ask him devil
[1:17:52] do you know tomorrow
[1:17:54] because you're telling me this is never
[1:17:55] going to happen maybe he's wasting
[1:17:57] breath talking to him but you just think
[1:17:59] about it
[1:17:59] he tell oh this ain't gonna happen you
[1:18:02] never see nothing move
[1:18:03] you know oh you say you've claimed them
[1:18:05] and this is gonna happen but you don't
[1:18:06] see anything
[1:18:07] and you say devil you don't know
[1:18:09] tomorrow
[1:18:10] my lord holds tomorrow hallelujah
[1:18:13] and my lord said all the father all that
[1:18:15] come to me i'll know why it's cast out
[1:18:18] and we have a story of the prodigal son
[1:18:20] i mean we've got
[1:18:22] cases of people who are you know there's
[1:18:24] a woman that was being brought up in the
[1:18:25] prayer line before brother branham
[1:18:26] and she died in the prayer line i
[1:18:29] learned she came back to life and she
[1:18:30] was in the meetings after that even
[1:18:32] years down the road
[1:18:33] hallelujah so don't tell me my god can't
[1:18:36] do
[1:18:37] i mean whatever the devil's fighting or
[1:18:38] trying to hold you and says oh i've got
[1:18:40] this you can't get it back
[1:18:41] who said that you know i love about the
[1:18:43] story of ziglag and david
[1:18:45] hallelujah because he he he encouraged
[1:18:48] himself from the lord
[1:18:49] you know no doubt the devil because he
[1:18:51] his own men turned against him they even
[1:18:54] consulted we're going to stone david
[1:18:56] and you think about these men they
[1:18:57] forsook all to follow this runaway
[1:19:00] i mean this man who's on the run you
[1:19:02] know if not that
[1:19:03] israel had you know the fbi in those
[1:19:05] days or whatever but
[1:19:07] you know he would have been numb one of
[1:19:08] the most wanted top ten
[1:19:10] was david maybe plastered around every
[1:19:13] city was posters
[1:19:14] dead or alive david of bethlehem
[1:19:17] you know but these men knew he was
[1:19:19] coming into power
[1:19:21] oh they knew he was coming into power
[1:19:23] and they forsook all to follow david
[1:19:25] but then they came to a place where you
[1:19:27] know they'd come back and they came back
[1:19:29] to zig lag where home was
[1:19:30] and they saw the smoke rising or
[1:19:32] whatever they saw and they came back
[1:19:34] into the city and they saw all their
[1:19:35] children
[1:19:36] all their family was gone the things
[1:19:38] that were most precious to them
[1:19:40] were gone and they and they got to such
[1:19:44] a spot because it says
[1:19:45] yeah the bible says they wept until they
[1:19:46] could weep no more
[1:19:48] hallelujah but then they
[1:19:51] and then they even in their pain and
[1:19:53] anguish because now no doubt the devil's
[1:19:54] just yo
[1:19:55] playing on this now look where he's
[1:19:58] brought you
[1:20:00] you thought this man would become king
[1:20:02] he can't even protect your families
[1:20:04] look at look at your reward of serving
[1:20:06] this man
[1:20:07] and they begin to talk yeah that you
[1:20:09] know emotions are relay
[1:20:11] we're not robots overcoming is not
[1:20:14] shutting down your emotions
[1:20:16] that's not healthy we have real emotions
[1:20:19] we should feel happy
[1:20:21] we should feel sad when we're sad we
[1:20:23] should grieve when we
[1:20:24] you know suffer loss you know david said
[1:20:27] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[1:20:29] the rock that is higher than i
[1:20:30] so it's okay for our us to feel
[1:20:32] overwhelmed
[1:20:33] right so no doubt the devil played on
[1:20:36] them and then they consulted now we're
[1:20:38] just going to stone him we're just going
[1:20:39] to get rid of this guy
[1:20:41] and so no doubt david now he would feel
[1:20:44] the same anguish because his own family
[1:20:46] had been taken
[1:20:47] where'd they go and they didn't know and
[1:20:50] and and as children all these things
[1:20:51] were gone and no doubt the devil is
[1:20:53] playing on his mind
[1:20:55] it's over you've crossed a bridge too
[1:20:57] far
[1:20:59] you know you've you've overextended
[1:21:01] yourself this is the end look even your
[1:21:03] own
[1:21:03] even your own men are gonna try and kill
[1:21:05] you they want to stone you
[1:21:07] they didn't have happy grins on their
[1:21:08] face they were angry at this man
[1:21:10] they were angry at david but he
[1:21:12] encouraged himself in the lord
[1:21:14] see this is the big challenge you know
[1:21:16] it's easy after the trial to praise and
[1:21:17] rejoice and say god did this and god did
[1:21:19] this
[1:21:19] what about in the valley when the
[1:21:21] enemy's pressing in you can even feel
[1:21:23] his breath on your neck and you're
[1:21:24] fighting and there's
[1:21:25] great anguish and trials and trouble in
[1:21:27] your mind i mean can you rejoice even in
[1:21:30] that moment
[1:21:31] amen because you know there's got to be
[1:21:32] a mountain after the valley
[1:21:34] hallelujah it's not always valleys all
[1:21:35] the time there's got to be a mountain
[1:21:37] oh there's got to be an end of a trial
[1:21:38] maybe every trial has an expiry date
[1:21:41] it's got a best before date and it goes
[1:21:43] off it's done
[1:21:44] right hallelujah and so here he is he
[1:21:47] delights himself in the lord why because
[1:21:48] he began to think back
[1:21:50] i was a shepherd boy the prophet samuel
[1:21:53] came to my home
[1:21:54] even my own father didn't consider me
[1:21:57] but god
[1:21:58] god told samuel i've got a king in
[1:22:00] jesse's house and i just happened to be
[1:22:02] that man
[1:22:03] hallelujah and i felt the anointing oil
[1:22:05] come down remember sometimes you've got
[1:22:06] to go back and remind god of the
[1:22:08] covenant he made with you remember
[1:22:10] it's one thing for us to make a promise
[1:22:12] to god but when he makes a promise to
[1:22:13] you
[1:22:14] that's a very different thing because he
[1:22:15] cannot fail on his side of the bargain
[1:22:18] he will not withdraw he'll not say well
[1:22:19] i'm sorry the conditions have changed
[1:22:21] and you know
[1:22:22] you know it's it's unprecedented times
[1:22:24] i'll be kind and you know
[1:22:25] it's covered 19. you know i'm sorry we
[1:22:27] just we can't
[1:22:28] i can't fulfill my word in this kind of
[1:22:30] season that's not how god works
[1:22:32] i mean when he promised his word he knew
[1:22:35] the condition that it would be fulfilled
[1:22:36] in your life
[1:22:38] he knew the troubles you'd be going
[1:22:39] through the strife whatever may be
[1:22:41] happening
[1:22:41] the global events everything he knew
[1:22:43] what would be happening but yet he said
[1:22:44] i'm going to fulfill that in your life
[1:22:46] irrespective of what's going on and so
[1:22:49] david began to encourage himself said
[1:22:50] lord i remember when the anointing oil
[1:22:52] was poured upon me by a vindicated
[1:22:53] prophet where i could say when the word
[1:22:55] was poured out
[1:22:57] hallelujah and some and he said the
[1:22:58] spirit of god was with him from that day
[1:23:00] on
[1:23:01] hallelujah and lord i remember when i
[1:23:02] was taken from there and there's a lion
[1:23:04] came and i killed the lion
[1:23:06] and then the bear came in and i killed
[1:23:07] the bear cause those sheep were not
[1:23:08] going to be food for a lion or a bear
[1:23:10] i mean i'm not yeah i didn't let the
[1:23:11] devil get one of my sheep hallelujah
[1:23:14] and then i was just taking my brother's
[1:23:16] lunch them in the battle
[1:23:17] and then goliath was there holly and you
[1:23:20] anointed that stone lord
[1:23:22] i swung it round hallelujah even through
[1:23:24] my own voice
[1:23:25] i spoke you spoke of his his demise
[1:23:28] hallelujah i'll cut your head off david
[1:23:30] said he didn't even have a sword
[1:23:32] hallelujah and then so yeah and then and
[1:23:34] then david went down
[1:23:35] i mean sorry goliath went down david cut
[1:23:38] his head off with glass sword
[1:23:40] and he walked out packing the victory
[1:23:42] hallelujah
[1:23:43] and then he could go through all those
[1:23:45] things what was he doing he was
[1:23:46] delighting or encouraging himself with
[1:23:48] the lord his god
[1:23:49] lord you brought me thus far amen and
[1:23:51] what does that do that silences
[1:23:53] that's hissing of the serpent hallelujah
[1:23:57] because you see really
[1:23:58] god's made a covenant with me as i said
[1:24:00] before it's not us making a promise to
[1:24:02] god
[1:24:03] which we must give our lives to but it's
[1:24:04] really when you realize he's made a
[1:24:06] covenant with you
[1:24:08] and he will bankrupt heaven before he
[1:24:10] lets that fall to the ground
[1:24:11] hallelujah and then he began to
[1:24:13] encourage himself in the lord and then
[1:24:14] he begin to acquire with god god what
[1:24:16] shall we do
[1:24:18] and then he was told pursue for you
[1:24:21] shall recover all
[1:24:23] hallelujah you shall recover all amen so
[1:24:27] that he went from being just you know in
[1:24:28] despair and trouble but because his
[1:24:30] source of strength was god
[1:24:33] i trust he's your source of strength
[1:24:35] it's not your carnality not what you
[1:24:37] think about people and trying to have a
[1:24:38] higher
[1:24:39] higher status in the church forget it
[1:24:40] we're all the same
[1:24:42] by the way you know forget that kind of
[1:24:44] thing or all the influence you have over
[1:24:45] this one whatever no forget all that
[1:24:46] stuff
[1:24:47] our source of strength should not be
[1:24:50] the number of friends we have or we're
[1:24:52] the best friend with everyone or this or
[1:24:54] whatever no
[1:24:54] our source of strength is god i mean
[1:24:57] this word that he's given us that should
[1:24:58] be our source of strength
[1:25:00] he went to a source of strength and his
[1:25:01] and what did he do he stepped into a
[1:25:03] sphere of faith
[1:25:05] and he was promised you shall recover
[1:25:08] all
[1:25:09] hallelujah and what to do he pursued
[1:25:11] amen and he went
[1:25:13] and got what the devil had taken maybe
[1:25:15] in his mind before that happened he
[1:25:17] thought how
[1:25:17] am i ever going to get out of this one
[1:25:20] and the devil always plagues just with
[1:25:22] uncertainty how is this ever gonna
[1:25:25] happen
[1:25:26] you know we're gonna you know there's a
[1:25:28] there's a uh um
[1:25:30] uh in in pidgin english i know this may
[1:25:32] sound a bit silly but
[1:25:33] in pigeon english if you say it's your
[1:25:36] problem
[1:25:36] you say problem belong you right
[1:25:40] if we are if we are in god's economy
[1:25:44] we are god's problem he's going to look
[1:25:46] after us
[1:25:47] right he has to fulfill his word in our
[1:25:49] lives i mean if we're surrendered to
[1:25:51] remember david was thinking how am i
[1:25:53] gonna how am i ever gonna how am i ever
[1:25:54] gonna get my family back they're not
[1:25:56] here
[1:25:56] they're not dead among ziggler they're
[1:25:58] gonna be somewhere but he had a
[1:26:00] you know but when god said you'll
[1:26:02] recover all
[1:26:03] he just believed he's gonna recover all
[1:26:05] he wasn't worried about the details this
[1:26:07] is just me
[1:26:08] he just knew the word was going to be
[1:26:09] fulfilled harlem what did he do
[1:26:12] he recovered all shouldn't that be the
[1:26:14] same thing with you and i
[1:26:16] am i don't know how it's going to happen
[1:26:18] but i believe it's going to happen
[1:26:20] i mean i don't know how the body i don't
[1:26:21] know how the rapture is going to happen
[1:26:22] i believe it's going to happen
[1:26:24] sure you know while the you know the
[1:26:26] holy ghost comes and you and our bodies
[1:26:27] you know i understand that
[1:26:29] that but how's it really going to happen
[1:26:31] the dead in christ are going to rise you
[1:26:32] know
[1:26:33] i want to see brother blue kennedy
[1:26:34] sister val different ones have gone on
[1:26:36] you know i don't know how they're going
[1:26:37] to come out of the grave i know by the
[1:26:39] power of god but
[1:26:40] you know what i mean hallelujah
[1:26:43] the details of that all belongs to god
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:47] hallelujah so now i you know
[1:26:50] all things are possible to them that
[1:26:52] believe amen so don't be all shut down
[1:26:56] because what happened eve was basically
[1:26:58] shut down because of the lies of the
[1:26:59] serpent
[1:27:02] we shouldn't worry about what the devil
[1:27:03] tries to do you know even
[1:27:07] it says here in in hebrews 3 take heed
[1:27:10] brethren least there be
[1:27:11] in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[1:27:13] and departing from the living god
[1:27:15] but exalt one another daily while it's
[1:27:17] called today at least any of you should
[1:27:19] be hardened
[1:27:20] through the deceitfulness of sin now
[1:27:23] this word hardened
[1:27:24] it means surrender stubborn now someone
[1:27:28] becomes stubborn
[1:27:29] because they think their idea is better
[1:27:31] than the idea presented to them
[1:27:33] irrespective of of how of how illogical
[1:27:37] their stand may be right
[1:27:40] so and then also this hardening means to
[1:27:43] lose
[1:27:43] i'm hard and also means to lose feeling
[1:27:47] so it's a it's a stubbornness but but in
[1:27:49] that you actually lose feeling towards
[1:27:51] the lord
[1:27:53] now there was a brother there was a
[1:27:55] brother evan john roberts who who was a
[1:27:58] he was a young man who was one of the
[1:28:00] leaders of the welsh revival
[1:28:02] and before the revival broke out who
[1:28:05] knows what about the
[1:28:06] welsh revival even yep okay before that
[1:28:09] revival broke out
[1:28:11] there was a brief period of time in his
[1:28:13] life where he said
[1:28:15] even seeing the cross brought no tears
[1:28:18] to his eyes
[1:28:19] it didn't stir his heart anymore and
[1:28:22] that greatly bothered him
[1:28:25] thankfully the lord brought him out of
[1:28:26] it but the danger is some people get
[1:28:29] used to losing feeling
[1:28:33] we're not a bunch of wood we have
[1:28:36] feeling
[1:28:37] but he was bothered lord why does this
[1:28:38] not move me anymore it's the emblem of
[1:28:41] suffering and shame he took my sins up
[1:28:42] on
[1:28:43] your pin to a cross now to a cross why
[1:28:45] does this not bother me anymore
[1:28:46] you know what i mean i mean why does it
[1:28:47] why does it you know not stir me anymore
[1:28:50] and that bothered him and the lord
[1:28:52] brought him out of it
[1:28:53] so he must never ever get to a place
[1:28:56] where
[1:28:56] living in just a carnal state is normal
[1:29:02] right we must always i trust have you
[1:29:04] ever walked in a spiritual way
[1:29:05] where the lord is you know you just fall
[1:29:07] in love with him i believe in a
[1:29:09] heartfelt religion
[1:29:10] this message is a heartfelt religion
[1:29:12] hallelujah it's not head knowledge it's
[1:29:14] a heartfelt religion
[1:29:15] so you think about what the lord has
[1:29:17] done for you and how great he is and
[1:29:18] just how much you know we should never
[1:29:20] it should never become
[1:29:21] common you know it's like you're like
[1:29:24] you know a marriage and god forbid it
[1:29:26] ever happened but you know
[1:29:27] you're you know you're in your first
[1:29:29] love and then a few years down the track
[1:29:31] it's all hey you
[1:29:33] you know it just kind of boils down to
[1:29:35] nothing
[1:29:37] that should never be with the lord so oh
[1:29:39] lord you're my everything i love you so
[1:29:41] much and then a few years down the
[1:29:42] ladder
[1:29:43] oh hey you how are you you're
[1:29:46] not you know not even the how are you it
[1:29:48] should never come down to that
[1:29:53] deceitfulness it's to give a
[1:29:56] false impression the serpent
[1:30:00] gave a false impression to eve you won't
[1:30:03] die
[1:30:04] the consequences aren't really death
[1:30:08] you'll be like god's doing good and evil
[1:30:10] they already were gods
[1:30:12] they already were gods you know but
[1:30:15] what the world wants to do or the
[1:30:17] serpents do is expand your mind
[1:30:20] expand your world what to know well they
[1:30:22] already knew good but now i want to
[1:30:24] teach you evil
[1:30:25] you need to get out more you know it's a
[1:30:28] false impression
[1:30:30] because the reality of the consequences
[1:30:33] were really an entirely different thing
[1:30:35] what did it make them do god came down
[1:30:37] for fellowship in the call of the
[1:30:38] evening
[1:30:39] and they hid themselves the day before
[1:30:42] that
[1:30:42] hallelujah father god how are you this
[1:30:44] is awesome how's your day in the garden
[1:30:46] children are wonderful
[1:30:47] and they worship god under the great
[1:30:49] cathedral of the trees and different
[1:30:50] things you know but
[1:30:51] because of this happened they hid from
[1:30:53] god
[1:30:55] we don't want to hide
[1:30:59] from him no time anywhere
[1:31:02] amen now if i have
[1:31:06] amen as i said before
[1:31:11] uh a little levin living with the whole
[1:31:13] lump
[1:31:15] and sin can be so deceitful that we
[1:31:19] even think that that it's actually
[1:31:21] someone else's the problem
[1:31:24] ahab would come to a spot where the
[1:31:26] drought had come on elijah had come into
[1:31:28] the throne room and said to him and
[1:31:30] jezebel
[1:31:30] no rain or jew will fall from the ground
[1:31:32] until i call for it
[1:31:34] and then so elijah is now you know you
[1:31:36] know the droughts come on
[1:31:38] and he's got to take i'm sorry not
[1:31:39] elijah but ahab's got a you know it
[1:31:41] takes
[1:31:41] you know the horses and animals and
[1:31:43] they're trying to find water and pasture
[1:31:44] for them through
[1:31:45] through israel and then he meets elijah
[1:31:49] and then ahab says to elijah aren't you
[1:31:52] the one that troubleth israel
[1:31:54] in other words this is all your fault
[1:31:55] elijah this is our deceitful sin was
[1:31:58] this is your fault elijah that we're in
[1:32:00] this predicament but elijah said to him
[1:32:02] no
[1:32:02] it's your fault because you and your
[1:32:05] father's house they have forsaken the
[1:32:07] commandments of god have followed baal
[1:32:09] that's how deceitful sin can be
[1:32:14] i'm nearly done
[1:32:17] now in james 1 and 13 we're just going
[1:32:20] to read through this and then we'll and
[1:32:22] then we'll um
[1:32:24] and then we'll go
[1:32:27] james one and and well i got 14 here
[1:32:40] but does anyone understand how the devil
[1:32:42] um
[1:32:43] speaks to your emotions makes you feel a
[1:32:46] certain way because you feel that
[1:32:47] certain way you go that certain way
[1:32:49] we've got to guard against that right
[1:32:51] you're gonna you've got to really it's
[1:32:53] real good sometimes to take stock of
[1:32:55] your life it takes the lord to really do
[1:32:56] it where you actually get next to
[1:32:57] yourself
[1:32:58] and really just examine why do i think
[1:33:00] this way
[1:33:01] why do i feel this way and it could be
[1:33:04] and it could be the truth oh brother
[1:33:06] so-and-so literally did this and this
[1:33:07] and this and this to me and he told me
[1:33:09] yeah i meant it
[1:33:11] you know well but does that give us any
[1:33:14] right
[1:33:14] no one's done that here by the way but
[1:33:15] you know but even if they did
[1:33:17] would that give me any right to hold it
[1:33:19] against them well of course
[1:33:22] they should be like this they should be
[1:33:24] loving and kind and they should speak on
[1:33:25] but what about you
[1:33:26] it's really about how we respond that
[1:33:29] really matters
[1:33:31] amen because even jesus said you know
[1:33:33] don't try and take the
[1:33:34] little basically twig out of your
[1:33:36] brother's eye when you've got a whole
[1:33:37] beam in your own eye
[1:33:39] oh i've got to fix this person no no
[1:33:40] what about you that you can see clearly
[1:33:43] you know so it's like lord help us lord
[1:33:47] help me amen and yeah i'm preaching to
[1:33:50] myself thank you for turning up
[1:33:52] uh james um 1 and 13. but every man is
[1:33:55] tempted hey we're all in this battle
[1:33:56] together
[1:33:57] we're all human being right yes good
[1:34:00] okay
[1:34:01] but every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:34:02] away of his own lust and entire sorry
[1:34:05] can you go back to verse 13 just just
[1:34:06] just real quick
[1:34:07] let no man say he is tempted i am
[1:34:09] tempted of god for god cannot be tempted
[1:34:11] with evil
[1:34:12] neither attempteth he any man now next
[1:34:14] one you go to
[1:34:15] 14. but every man is tempted when he's
[1:34:17] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:34:20] then when lust has conceived it bringeth
[1:34:22] forth death i was bringing forth sin
[1:34:24] and sin when his finish bringeth forth
[1:34:26] death
[1:34:27] do not uh my beloved brethren so he's
[1:34:31] saying here because men say oh praise
[1:34:33] the lord i'm being tempted of god he
[1:34:34] said no no no this is not true
[1:34:36] it's it's your own lust draws you away
[1:34:39] and you're enticed
[1:34:40] so there's so how does that really work
[1:34:42] the devil appeals to something in you
[1:34:45] to draw you away because if you say well
[1:34:48] god's god's allowed this i must just go
[1:34:50] through this trial hold on
[1:34:52] you know no it's we're drawn away by our
[1:34:54] own lust and enticed now
[1:34:56] he says do not er my beloved brethren
[1:34:59] now this this word er means to wander
[1:35:03] out of the way so don't wander out of
[1:35:05] the way brethren
[1:35:07] just keep walking with the lord he says
[1:35:09] for every good gift and every perfect
[1:35:11] gift is from above
[1:35:12] and cometh down from the father of
[1:35:14] lights with whom
[1:35:15] is no variableness neither shadow of
[1:35:17] turning but
[1:35:18] uh of his own will he uh so of his own
[1:35:22] will beget he
[1:35:23] us with the word of truth that we should
[1:35:26] be a kind of first fruits of
[1:35:28] his creatures wherefore my beloved
[1:35:30] brethren let
[1:35:31] every man be swift to hear slow to speak
[1:35:34] slow to wrath for the wrath of man
[1:35:37] worketh not the righteousness of god now
[1:35:39] what is the wrath of man basically you
[1:35:41] get annoyed at someone else you try and
[1:35:42] be a better christian
[1:35:44] that's the wrath of man and but you know
[1:35:47] when it says the wrath of man worketh
[1:35:49] not the righteousness of god
[1:35:51] what that means is the wrath of man
[1:35:53] cannot accomplish
[1:35:55] or fashion or perform the righteousness
[1:35:57] of god so you being angry with someone
[1:35:59] else cannot actually
[1:36:01] um perform or manifest or you know
[1:36:04] fashion the righteousness of god in your
[1:36:06] life
[1:36:08] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[1:36:11] superfluidity of naughtiness and receive
[1:36:13] with meekness the engrafted word which
[1:36:15] is able to save your souls
[1:36:17] but be doers of the word and not hearers
[1:36:19] only deceiving your own selves
[1:36:21] for if any bear hearer of the word and
[1:36:23] not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:36:25] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:36:27] for he beholdeth himself and gotham's
[1:36:29] way and
[1:36:30] straight away forgetteth what manner of
[1:36:32] man he is
[1:36:34] so he has been observing himself in the
[1:36:38] mirror but then when he walks away he
[1:36:39] forgets who he is
[1:36:41] and this is and this is how we must you
[1:36:44] know we got to remember who we are
[1:36:47] right i'm just gonna i'm gonna close
[1:36:49] just with this thought
[1:36:52] when the serpent came to eve he was
[1:36:54] giving her a different identity
[1:36:56] if you do this you'll be like god is
[1:36:57] knowing good and evil surely he was a
[1:36:59] god
[1:37:00] you know and that's how what could
[1:37:01] happen is because remember we're
[1:37:03] everything we should do we should walk
[1:37:04] after the spirit and we sing we sing in
[1:37:07] the spirit pray pray in the spirit how
[1:37:08] we deal with each other should be in the
[1:37:10] spirit
[1:37:11] not in our carnal makeup
[1:37:14] but if we go away from seeing what the
[1:37:16] word says about
[1:37:17] us and then the enemy comes in with a
[1:37:19] thought or something
[1:37:20] and we get into a carnal state what's
[1:37:22] happened we've beheld our image in the
[1:37:24] glass
[1:37:25] but then when we walk away and deal in a
[1:37:26] kind of way we forget who what manner of
[1:37:28] people we are
[1:37:34] amen i just finished with this quote
[1:37:36] here i know i've seen that a lot but
[1:37:37] let's just do this one
[1:37:38] divine healing in 54 sometimes we have
[1:37:41] growing pains
[1:37:43] when we get to be men and women when
[1:37:45] we're born in the kingdom of god
[1:37:46] christ but the thing about it is it
[1:37:47] hurts the thing about this it just makes
[1:37:50] you joyful and happy it's growing pains

[1:38:02] nothing about it but you're wider in
[1:38:04] here see

[1:38:07] you're supposed to spread out bigger in
[1:38:08] your heart
[1:38:09] on the inside when christ comes into the
[1:38:11] heart then he comes into the mouth
[1:38:13] then he comes into the eyes and he comes
[1:38:15] into the mind he comes into the mouth he
[1:38:17] makes you talk different

[1:39:24] against you

[1:39:29] the tree was to be desired off but

[1:39:33] and it dragged her from being
[1:39:37] god over the earth joint ears with adam
[1:39:40] dragged dragged her down that she was
[1:39:42] now under satan's grip

[2:07:48] keep that in mind you know the devil
[2:07:49] reminds us of our past
[2:07:51] we can go well know you know what i love
[2:07:53] about this
[2:07:54] you read in the old testament all the
[2:07:56] failures of the believers but then when
[2:07:58] it goes through the blood of jesus
[2:07:59] christ it's by faith
[2:08:01] and through faith there's none of there
[2:08:03] plainly is attributed to them but
[2:08:05] the devil's failures are always
[2:08:07] attributed to him
[2:08:09] she says you remember when you did this
[2:08:10] and this and this you say well devil
[2:08:12] remember on the day of whenever you know
[2:08:14] because the police say where were you on
[2:08:15] the night of the 14th and blah blah blah
[2:08:17] you said devil
[2:08:18] in the garden you said this and then
[2:08:20] before that you thought this in your
[2:08:22] heart
[2:08:23] and you're cast out of heaven and satan
[2:08:25] you did this and did this
[2:08:26] and he's got no he he's busted so remind
[2:08:29] him of his past
[2:08:31] because his past dictates his future
[2:08:33] he's going to burn in the lake of fire
[2:08:35] i mean but our past does not dictate our
[2:08:37] future the blood of jesus christ
[2:08:39] dictates our future that we're going up
[2:08:40] into glory
[2:08:41] amen so remember he doesn't let the
