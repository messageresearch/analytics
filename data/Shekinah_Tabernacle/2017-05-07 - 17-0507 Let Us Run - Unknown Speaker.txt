Cross isn't the end there's a crow waiting for you amen amen God bless you friends you just have your seats just quickly you want to stay here we're going to sing another song um I just want to read a few things you know we um there's a lot of us now praise the lord we only have limited space um the landlord we want to put put a wall up here to seal off the sanctuary but the landlord said just hold a minute so at the moment we're got to do the best with what we can do here first I actually want to welcome Jeff and be in the back God bless you it's great to have you here am God bless you welcome and we've got David here as well God bless you welcome amen we got Jessica the back as well you can't hide God bless you good to see you amen and it's also Joshua's birthday the Big 12 y God bless you brother and um since we' got the noes uh here we got church lunch at our place after service everyone's welcome um I just want to read a couple of things from uh God hiding himself in Simplicity before we turn to the service so brother Bram he's um he's about to dedicate Bram Tabernacle of it's been refurbished he just makes a few comments and he says so now in the building I think we ought to have it in this if it's been dedicated or going to be dedicated in a few minutes to the worship of God we should keep it that way we should never buy or sell in the building we should never do any business in this Auditorium here so this is the auditorium okay uh should never be done in here this is such as ministers come in to sell books and everything no matter what it is there's other places to do that so we shouldn't buy or sell in the house of Our Lord so he's talking about the sanctuary here it should be U so it should be a place of worship holy consecrated to that purpose he's give us a nice place and I say Amen amen amen let's dedicate it to him and dedicate ourselves um uh with it to him and now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary see we should never rally around we should never run around run through the run through the building or let our children run through the building and so doing this I feel not long ago doing this we constructed it that that we can take care of it all that way now this is not built that way this is not separate but this is still the sanctuary amen so we need to treat it as a sanctuary because as I read down a little while there's because brother B he lays out a pattern he's not just setting up some rules he's laying out a pattern this is how church should be and there's a reason we have things a certain ways because we want God to come down amen amen because we can please him or we can displease him you know so we want to now we know this is not separated off but you know just just keep that in mind but we're going to do the best we can now therefore dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter the sanctuary keep still one to another and worship God if you want to visit each other there's places you may visit each other uh like that but we're never walking around where you can't hear yourself think and some people come in they just don't know what to do see it's too much noise and things and it's just humanly he says and I've seen it in churches until it makes me feel bad because we do not come into the sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God and then we go to our homes this sanctu is dedicated to worship he says when stand outside talk anything you wish to as long as it's right and holy go to one another's houses visit one another in places but when you enter that door be quiet you come here to talk to himy and let them talk back to you the trouble of it is we do too much talking and we don't listen enough then when we come in here wait on him and he says and he says now there's little children babies he says they don't know any different and the only way they can get things is is to cry for it so we've got the babies room as you know and he says um now and he says about children and things crying says now it's never bothers me here in the Pulpit maybe I don't even notice it being anointed now I don't notice it but if you're sitting in the congregation you notice everything that's what I found so it doesn't bother me but it can bother it can bother the people around you and you can even see the devil you know we come to church this is the house of God devil the devil's here I guarantee you that much Satan is Among Us shouldn't be a surprise to you he was in Eden that was God's you know God said your your brother and said in the call of the evening God would come down the great big cathedrals of the trees Satan was there and Satan will try and Rob you cuz he's cuz he's here to oppose you to stop you getting what you need and he'll use anything he can he'll use a child you know he'll he'll he'll make you think I really need to go to the toilet and you go and you may miss a blessing amen oh you I need to go to toilet yo you children don't don't if you feel need to go to the toilet the service will be over you can hold on if you really no no no hey if you really need to go go but as soon as the answers your mind I need to go toilet just hold hold on if you can I bet you you can I remember sitting through movies 3 hours long I did not want to leave the cinema what's going to happen and you feel so robbed I don't want to let something's just a I can't go out because you're so gripped by what's going on true that's just entertainment what about where God is amen amen it depends what you know there's people as young as five have receiv received the Holy Ghost yes sir brother Tim pro he he says he gave his heart to the Lord at five and he never took it back 5 years old and I'm more than one 5ye old amen and there's many older than five here so don't think you're too young or you don't understand God's here that's right amen amen if he talks to your heart just give yourself to him amen that's right so if we have children you know if you're CH you know I've got young children too so I'm not you know I'm probably in this bracket the most but children are making a noise take them around the side here you can still hear the service but just think of you know what one another and so now he says and then many time teenage children and sometimes adults will get to you know young people will pass notes or cut up or something in church while you're old enough to know better than that see you should know better than that you shouldn't come here if you expect to be a real man someday to raise a family to the kingdom of God then start off in the beginning you see act right and do right and now then I've seen churches though to where children were permitted to run all over the sanctuary and that adults stand and holler across the room one to another now I'll just say this it is such a blessing that we have total Harmony between one another and it's virtually impossible just have a quick visit I found that you just can't have a quick visit you start talking and you have you enjoy one another this company you know but this is a place of worship okay and he says here now so after that St he says that's a good way this is what really hit me when I heard this that's a good way to ruin the ser coming that night or whatever time it is see to run around the church hollower one to another across the sanctu he says there a good way to ruin the services coming up and to me that's why you know what he and he says as soon as the service is dismissed leave the auditorium now that's if you're not so if you want to stay and pray stay and pray but if you finish praying just go out the back you know we have our black line there on the on the carpet just take the fellowship go just go out around the back or out the front or into the kitchen you know we know we don't have a lot of room we don't have a fellowship hall but we still got room okay so let's try and keep everything beyond the black line when it comes to Fellowship okay because I for one do not want to ruin the service coming up amen you know and we have we have brother brother kuin our Deacon you know it's his role as as I'm just reminding you as he knows he's the policeman of the church he keeps the order it doesn't matter who speak it could be me having some fellowship here if he says hey take it out the back I say yes brother cuz that's his role amen and it's important because this is a house of worship now don't feel all bound down all this is all stricted no it's not we want to do this to please the Lord amen okay we have you our houses across the road we have we can go have Fellowship you know amen so you know we we we have the we don't have a wall one day we will if not we'll move somewhere else you know but let's just try and keep this as we I know you're sincere I know you all love the Lord but you know we just got to it's so easy to go back to other ways just have Fellowship you know and here and forget the you know how it should be is that all right amen amen amen and then so yeah so um I'll keep reminding the landlord about the wall cuz we have the ability we have the funds we can put it up but we're just waiting on him so so with all that in mind let's just stand and let's just sing uh in Heavenly armor into the land The Battle Belongs to the Lord as we just turn to the word amen amen God bless you friends God bless remember Jesus God just sorry before we sing this I want just remember the Lord typed himself as a lamb and a and as a dove in the scripture behold here comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove when he got baptized River Jordan the Reason God showed himself that way is that's the nature of the spirit of God he's Mighty in battle but you don't want to you know it's easy to scare a dove or a lamb they're skittish things so he's saying you got to have one you've got to got to have a lamb nature in your in your heart for him to descend upon you but we don't want to create a way that Grieves him and he flies away CU remember God is not a respector of persons well we're the bride he's not a respector of persons that's right you know he gives us Grace To Live his word but you understand what I mean amen so in Heavenly am will into the land let's just sing this shall [Music] we Brother John have to help me out brother [Music] [Music] Isaac the armor will enter the land The Battle Belongs to the [Music] Lord no weapon that's passion against us will stand The Battle Belongs to the Lord and we sing Glory [Applause] aor power and strength to the Lord and we sing Glory power and strength to the Lord darkness comes in like a blood The Battle Belongs to the Lord he's raised up a standard of the power of his love The

um if you got your Bibles handy amen God bless you musicians thank you thank you brother John [Music] Hallelujah let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews 11:32 and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of bar of Samson of Jeffy of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in the fight turned the flight the army of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had a trial pardon me of cruel mockings and scorings Y moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were sto stoned they were Sor aund they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about and sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also en camp and compassed about with so great a cloud of Witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's go to Isaiah 55 we read um read from verse eight this is one of my favorite favorite scriptures verse eight yes verse eight brother Isaiah 55 and8 he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as Heavens are higher than the earth and so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down at this part for as the rain cometh down and the snow from Heaven it turneth not hither but WTH the Earth that maketh it bring forth the bud and it uh and it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper and the thing where to I sent it amen amen so he sent his word to make a people in His image and it will accomplish what has been sent to do amen hallelujah amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious father how thankful we are we lord We Gather father we don't just gather Lord to see one another but we've gathered to meet with you this morning Lord Jesus we thank you you promised us we're two or three gathered in your name there you are in the midst father and Lord we uh Lord we gathered in your name father in The Wonderful Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ and father we want to just lift you up Lord give you praise this morning in adoration and Thanksgiving Lord because you've washed us Lord of our sins oh God we're sinless Lord Jesus Lord You've Lord You're molding us and shaping us into your image father and Lord we just thank you we can look into your word and it's not just ink on paper but Lord It's a Living Word father we hear your message it's a living voice father we thank you Lord that your life has come into US Lord and father I pray Lord anyone here who doesn't know you this morning Lord father may you just meet them Lord in a supernatural way Lord we can never be too young I believe father we can never be too far from you I believe Lord you can go anywhere oh god father so Lord I just pray would lay aside the cares of Life father what we may even face this afternoon or tomorrow and may we just Lord we just want to drink from the fountain we thank you Lord that you're among us oh God and there's room at the fountain to drink so father may you bless your word now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats so I want to uh take a if I can take a subject I want to speak about from from Hebrews 12 there he says let us run and and that's my subject let us run amen the Apostle Paul is is is admonishing us let us run amen he's not saying just walk or just get by or just sit back and just watch the world go by he says let us run amen so he's calling for a people amen not just to be spectators but get in the race amen There's One Life to Live there's one race Hallelujah so he's calling us now that we must run now in order to run you must know where you're running amen you must know where you're running and that's why I read there in um Isaiah 55 God sends his word upon the Earth it will not return to him void amen it will not just be empty speech but it will accomplish that that it's sent to do it will produce what it's meant to produce when he brooded over over the Earth in Genesis he says let there be life life came forth that's why he sent his his word upon the Earth am mean he brooded over the Earth to bring out a life Hallelujah and It produced an Eden and the same voice that said let there be light is speaking in 2017 amen uted his voice through the mouth of a prophet Amen to to gather a people to gather people not to a church not to a religion but to him amen that they would be made in His image Hallelujah that we would know how to run amen because in order to run a race you must know the rules of the race otherwise you get disqualified and it doesn't matter your good intentions what you're wanting to do if you break the rules you're disqualified it does so it doesn't matter how well you may run if you break the rules you're disqualified out of the race so we must run according to the rules and we must know as I said where we're running and we're running to the Rapture amen we're running to streets of gold Hallelujah so we have cause to run amen we have cause to run this race hallelujah hallelujah now we must also know where we are in the race and we're at the end of the race this has been a relay race that's right from Calvary down to now and we're not at the start of the race we're not the first church age running in the race we're at the end and we're not at the start of the Lan age we're in the bright age we're at the end of all things if we could just see how close we were it's just a few steps hallelujah it's not a one one way around the track it's right there am mean if you can see the body changes right there hallelujah we're at the end friends and if you're oh May our faith become sight amen because if you can see where you are you'd lay asight every weight you'd lay asight every sin amen you wouldn't be caught up in this life and oh I've got to do this forget it sure we got to provide for raise our children sure we're going to do those things but don't let it consume you don't let it consume you we could be out of here by today I say praise the Lord hallelujah amen if we could see where we are amen I'm not just excited there's a reality this is not the boy who cried wolf cuz one day we're not going to be here we're going to be gone and you don't want to be left behind because God gives the ability to run hallelujah hallelujah he equips he sends forth his word that the people that believe his word can live it out and he doesn't make you do it in your Humanity he gives you the ability amen it's by his Spirit don't trust in the arm of Flesh W unto you if you trust in your own ability you will be stuck here amen but if you lean upon his Everlasting Arms he'll take you sh as the world Amen but if you hold back in of yourself you'll be stuck here I guarantee you that you're going to give everything am amen this is not a casual go for a jog amen that's right amen this is a race hallelujah hallelujah and there's only one chance you only have one chance to run this race amen hallelujah we are at the end I'm glad he says in in 1963 we have seen his star and the and we have come to worship him he says is in a prayer Alm mighty God we thank thee tonight from the very depths of our hearts for the love of Christ that's been shed abroad in our hearts in these last days Hallelujah by the Holy Ghost we thank thee because we have the privilege of assembling ourselves together and worshiping thee and having this Blessed assurance that someday you're coming for your church we thank thee to be the lightbearers of this age amen amen I trust something in you says that's me Amen to be here ready to manifest the promised word for the age that we're living now in no knowing that in the beginning you allotted out your word knowing the end from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each one of those ages as we look back upon Thy word and we see that there was an anointing come in that age that fulfilled that word and in the days that we're now living in there's an a lotted word a promise for this age we believe that the holy spirit is here on Earth now trying to find hearts and I pray oh God find Hearts this morning to manifest and to bring to pass by vindicating the word that's now prophesied for this day and hour Hallelujah God has allotted his word he didn't put you in the beginning many people say I'd love to be in the days of Jesus he didn't put you there he put you in this age amen when you put it together a relay team you place certain runners in certain stages of the relay yeah and and certain abilities of the Run is you know the one who's the fastest runner will be at the End Amen and the and the other Runners they'll have different abilities and they're placed in that kind of you know part of the relay so God God saw the ability in you he put a seed in you amen he knew what it would produce when his light struck that seed Hallelujah he knew you'd be in this age don't wonder why am I here now God wanted you here you're not here by accident doesn't matter if your parents thought you an accident God knew you would be here hallelujah God purposed you would be here you know there's a I heard a testimony brother Tim DOD shared when I was over in Canada he said there was a couple and they had a child and both of the husband and wife they got sterilized then they had another child they got sterilized again they had I think a third child then they got sterilized again the third child is a Believer amen amen the others aren't wow nothing can stop God bringing children for hallelujah hallelujah amen so he knew you would be here hallelujah amen so now we are called to run he says he says in Christ's mystery of God revealed see you got to we are not just it doesn't matter how you feel I'll just I'll drop it in right now Naomi in the Book of Ruth was fulfilling the word for her day here she was she went she left the promised land god knew Ruth had God knew Ruth had to come in yes amen I believe I'm speaking you know if you think you youo we beat ourselves up of the of the quality of Our Testimony here's Naomi she leaves the promised land with her husband her two boys marry these moik girls her husband dies her sons die she's a widow in a Strange Land now she hears now there bread in Bethlehem I'm going to go back her LIF affected Ruth I just want you to now if she looked at her life she'd say well I'm back sliding out of the land it's all gone sideways how could I even say that I'm an Israelite and her life affected Ruth in such a way Ruth said your God will be my God your people will be my people where I where you die all die that was the effect of Naomi's testimony on Ruth something influenced her and it was the life of Naomi right yeah that's true think about it it wasn't a very good oh you think that's not a powerful witness and we beat ourselves up up but Ruth Naomi fulfilled what she had to fulfill in her day it wasn't glamorous it wasn't glorious amen but Ruth had to marry Boaz Hallelujah to bring forth a lineage of Kings amen so it doesn't don't beat yourself up Naomi ran she lived out the word in her age Hallelujah so don't beat yourself up oh how could I run she ran amen her life the whole purpose of her life was get Ruth into the promise land amen that she that that Ruth would marry the Mighty Man of wealth Hallelujah and bring forth OED and OED Jesse and Jesse David Hallelujah only Ruth could do it Ruth had to marry Boaz and it was Naomi's doing Naomi instructed Ruth where to go and what to do on the threshing floor that's right Hallelujah so we think sometimes what am I producing what an army to produce in God's eyes that was his word being lived out amen didn't understand what was going on so don't beat yourself up just run amen amen just run hallelujah amen he says in Christ the mystery God revealed he says the devil can't stand it that's the reason these e ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's why the world is this way he can't stand it that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme is being uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body that's why he HS that's why he against you amen because the devil had you in darkness and he always hides in Secrets but then the word comes and you want to get rid of that thing you want to get rid of that sin or that that secret and the devil begins to howl because he knows as soon as you confess it you make it right he's exposed and defeated hallu amen you want to break the chains of the enemy confess hallelujah hallelujah then he has no power amen you think I'm beside myself thises brother BR I could ask you the same question I'm not we've got the devil's answer amen it's not me that liveth this is his answer it's not me that liveth but Christ The Living Word in me it's not my idea it's his power it's not my dear it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we've got his answer Christ has risen and has paid the price for our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh uh that and blood and that the blood uh might come to life and the flesh be redeemed that God in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day he says oh glory amen so he would take you now brother a talking about himself but you got to put yourself in there amen that he would through redeemed flesh who's who's redeemed flesh this morning that through redeemed flesh he would manifest himself Hallelujah that's what he said amen and that's why now to run amen you have to be you have to be in the race amen and in order to be in the race God has to be in you amen you have to say I've decided to follow Jesus and once you say I've decide to follow Jesus and you surrender your entire life he will seal you when you're willing to give a full surrender he'll seal you into the kingdom and then you can run amen amen cuz it's not him that willth or him that runneth in his own ability but God that give us Mercy Hallelujah Jes now Jesus gave a parable in Matthew chapter 20 he says the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that in a householder when he went out early in the morning to hire laborers in into his Vineyard let's go down to verse 20 because he hires different people throughout the day so when even was come the Lord of The Vineyard saith unto his stewards call the laborers give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first and when they came that were hired about the 11th Hour they received Every Man a penny but when the first came they supposed that they would should have received more and they likewise received Every Man a penny and when they had received it they murmured against the good man of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou Hast made them equal unto us which has borne the burden In the Heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend I do thee no wrong did us not thou agree with me for a penny take that thy uh take that thyers and go thy way I will give unto thee last even as unto thee is it not lawful for me to do what I'll do with mine own this uh this thine eye evil because I am good so the last shall be first the first uh last and many are called but uh few are chosen we've been called we are the 11th our workers upon the upon the world amen amen we haven't borne the heat of the day like others yes right I say praise the Lord but God but God knew who would bear the heat of the day God knew who would have to labor and labor and labor amen sure we labor but we are just really receiving the benefits of the people's labors that have borne the heat of the day but everyone receives the same reward am everyone receives a Crown of Life hallelujah amen but we have to understand where we are in the race amen because we are the 11th our workers there's not an age after this one Amen brother Ram said that these young men would take this message until the sweep it till the coming of the Lord many believe that was a previous generation but this is this generation amen we are if you consider yourself a young man we are living out we are living out what he said would happen there has to be young people that carry this message as not just 30 year olds it can be 5y olds God uses children he uses teenagers he uses anyone he will if you give yourself over to him Hallelujah so it doesn't age doesn't mean nothing you just may have more life experience but when it comes to serving God just give yourself amen amen this race is not a Sprint now maybe I'll just lay these points out first now to run a race naturally to win Hallelujah now let's go to 1 Corinthians 9 actually I I'll read this ver I don't want to jump ahead of myself Paul knew what it was like to see racist he says in 1 Corinthians 9 and 24 he saw the the Olympics of the day what they would do he saw athletes he says know you not that they which ra run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain so you got to run to win that's right and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things uh now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we and Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so I so fight I not as one that beateth the air so he he knows what he's running for he knows what he's called to do am amen he said at the end you know it was years after the road to Damascus experience he standing before King agria and he gives the account of meeting God on the road to Damascus he says therefore I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and so he ran amen he ran the race he ran his race in his day and he had opposition will come to it and he had heart he had trial he had all kinds of things to face but it didn't hinder him he ran the race anyway amen so he knew that to run you must you run to win you don't run to come second you don't run to come third you run to win amen amen and that's what we're called to do we we have called to run to win amen amen so to run a race naturally to win you must have ambition amen amen it's not the size of the dog it's the size of the fight in the dog amen amen and that is the main thing you know I heard brother Ron Spencer he preached a sermon quite a long time ago about um influenced by eternity and he said there's the Kentucky Derby in America people spend millions of dollars one guy spends millions of dollars to find the right horse and to train it and everything he's never I don't think he's ever won the race and there was this one horse and it didn't look like a champion but one guy decided to buy it anyway and he decided to train it and put it on the horse it do look like a champion but it won amen because it's that unseen part of the animal it's the size of the fight in the dog I trust I get that the right way it's the size of the fight in the dog that counts amen and so now to to run a race to win you must have ambition and ambition is generated because they believe they can do it or it's been revealed to them they can do it I mean that's why people you know you know people try and win at the Olympics they believe they can do it they believe they've done the training they've you know they have the stats they believe they can do it and that generates ambition amen because you can really put yourself in hey I'm going to win today I mean you never see people go onto the field or to the track look look defeated they're focused they know they've been spending years sometimes training theyve their whole lifestyle has been changed for One race for One race their whole life has been rearranged amen amen if it's been revealed that you're going to win that will give you all the ambition you need amen it's the influence also of the Unseen that causes us to win as I said about the horse the influence so now we have been influenced by an unseen realm we are not walking this walk this is not a hap Hazard amen I'll I'll serve God the best I can and then maybe when I stand before a stone you'll say Well done no that's not the that's not the race that's not the walk it's I known whom I have believe I've been cleansed of every sin amen I'm not walking in doubt that maybe he'll receive me he's received me Hallelujah his Spirit has come upon you change your nature you've been received Hallelujah and it's through the message of the hour you received amen cuz he comes the bridegroom stands into a prophet vessel invitation goes out will you come will you come to the wedding supper will you become come be married to our lord Jesus Amen brother bar preach a sermon as your life worthy of the Gospel El and he talks about when the servants go out the ones that are invited they don't come and they are sent to another group of people they don't come then they go to the highways and byways those people come and he says that's the three polls of his ministry there's the healing and then the discernment all the reason was it for people to come to the wedding supper and then the third pole goes out which it has Amen to receive the halt blame uh lame and Halt and blind amen they would come into the feast Hallelujah Hallelujah and he says the Pentecostals turn down the supernatural Feast they turn down the wedding invitation because they'd rather stick with their church and what their daddies told them instead of actually looking into the word themselves and saying I'm going to serve God as he has led me amen we don't want to hold on to tradition what does it mean okay I'm just going to I was thinking about this the other few days ago what does it mean to take the lord's name in vain right what does it mean mean people many times we think it's using his name as a curse word which you should never do because there's power in that name but to take the lord's name in vain to me Jesus said by teaching the Commandments and doctrines of men you make my word no effect amen so they are trying to embrace or receive his name but because there the Creeds and doctrines of men it makes it in vain yes amen so they are breaking they are taking the Law's name in vain because they take Creeds and dogmas above the word amen amen amen I'm glad we're not in that category amen thank you Jesus amen amen so we never want yeah so people's hearts are C there's power in the name of Jesus that's why you never say people you never people people never use oh oh Buddha as a curse word or oh Muhammad or oh confucious you know you never hear people say that because there's no power in those names that's why people use the name of Jesus Christ cuz there's absolute power in that name Hallelujah Hallelujah now when the Finishing Line I I mentioned this before but when the Finishing Line gets closer it gives the runner an extra due boost of adrenaline amen amen it does so when you see the Finish Line come closer it gives you a boost I'm nearly there I'm going to win amen hallelujah and it focuses you a whole bit you may be running a cross country or Marathon but when you come down to that final 100 m you've you find you've still got some gas in the tank that you may not have felt before you come around that home stretch I know what I'm talking about once upon a time I used to do those things Once Upon a Time amen but when you see that Finish Line you're focused hallelujah amen so now if by faith you can see the Finish Line Hallelujah who sees the Finish Line amen we're not we're not just grouping in darkness we know we know where we are amen I'm so glad Jesus said now this is just me he says you hear of rumors of war wars and rumors of wars see that you not be troubled all these things must come come to pass but the end is not yet and we've got Wars rumors of wars nuclear war North Korea you know America Russia but the Glorious thing brother Braham says in 1959 and and God's provided way he says and remember before one of those bombs can drop don't forget this Jesus says As it was the days of Noah and in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and before Noah before any rain fell Noah was in the ark safely and before fire fell on Sodom lot was outside and before one bomb can strike the church will be home and Glory gone Hallelujah so we don't need to be afraid amen let let these wars and rumors of wars happen before one bomb drops Hallelujah we'll be in Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so don't be afraid of those things he promised to take us out of the way before the destruction comes amen so to me now oh the rumors is built and the saber rattling gets louder what's happening it's building hallelujah what does that mean the finish line is closer H that means the change in this body is closer am Hallelujah Glory To Our God hallelujah now this is not a Sprint even though at the end even though at the end it's not a Sprint Paul says that we had run this race run it with patience yes amen so it is not a Sprint you can't just give all of your energy you know you know you've got to you've got to run it correctly amen cuz some people can just get burnt out or burn themselves out you got to run with patience remember it could be right now amen I don't say that to excite you it could be right now brother Bose's just burning up Ethiopia I say Flame the fa yo Flame the fire I mean you see those testimonies people just get baptized come out of the water God's spirit just fills them right there and there I say glory amen because hey God's doing a quick short work and the message has never been in that country before Hallelujah I believe there has to be Ethiopians in heaven every Kindred nation and tongue amen and he could find the last one tomorrow praise God I say please I don't care who does it I don't care who who who finds them just get them found hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now that's why I should keep holding them up in prayer yeah amen amen cuz amen cuz we got to yeah just just keep them in prayer keep the Believers in prayer over there amen now we're got to run run this race with patience now it says in it says in um says in no what I'll just go to this ver so we got to run this race with patience now we understand we're at the Finish Line though right and now normally normally the in a relay race you pass on the B yep but in this the last Runner of this relay doesn't pass the Bon on they become the B right because we've had the Dark Ages and then there's Luther Luther came forth and then Wesley you know the seed that fell on the ground and died the plant begins to grow again until in the last age the wheat that fell in the ground is produced in the head amen and all the stages before that were just carriers of the life amen but then those in the last age and the bride age they don't they're not carriers they become the life Hallelujah because they become wheat because they are wheat amen hallelujah so we don't just run with this message and pass it out we become it amen that this word this message must put on flesh God is Not Looking for message books to Rapture or Bibles he's looking for human vessels amen that are filled with his word HJ Hallelujah so we become amen we become the torch Hallelujah exactly amen there must be I trust if there's not some ambition we're not a bunch of jello yes that's right we're not just jellyfish floating along I trust there's something in you saying I want to serve the Lord amen I trust there's something in you I want to be a Christian Hallelujah cuz that means you've got ambition amen now it says in James 1 and3 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen amen now in this race we have an enemy and he's trying to stop us from running right but he has been defeated right amen our enemy trying to stop you running has been defeated amen so we don't need to he's already been overcome amen but he will try and stop you and your faith will either paralyze the world or the world will paralyze your faith brother BR said it so it's depending what you wanting do you want your faith to paralyze the enemy yes or do you want the enemy to paralyze your faith it's up to you what do you want if you're ambition you know if you just sit back and let it paralyze your faith that's right your faith will be paralyzed yes amen but if there's something in you say no I want to run Hallelujah I've got this life to live Hallelujah I want to give it to himall not just an excitement but in the good times and in the bad times when you feel like you're going to take a body change when you don't feel anything there's just got to be something in you I trust because now to run this race it is a run of Faith amen and so therefore our faith as it says the trying of your faith worketh patience so there will be times when your faith is tried amen that you run will try to be hindered but remember God is calling us to a walk that it doesn't matter what situation we're in or what's going on in life your faith will subdue what's going on am Jesus talked about I mean brother BR talk well I'd say it's Jesus cuz it was Jesus and brother brand he said the prophecy of perfect Faith Peter walking on the water he had perfect Faith but he be to look at the situations around him then he be to sink but if he ignored what was going on around him then he continued to walk in perfect faith and that is what God has called us to do in this hour am to walk in perfect Faith so it doesn't matter if your life naturally is going backwards or in pieces or totally in just as dust and Ashes you can say I'm running am amen amen because to run you must be unced right you can't run if you got a big massive pack on your back you can't do a Sprint if you did that would be awesome but you know most people can't do it they run slower than when they don't have it on their back yes right so you cannot run if you are if you got a big weight on you we must run unencumbered yes amen yes amen amen Paul said in Galatians 5:7 he says now ye did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you so he's asking the question you ran well you started the race real good but what is hindering you Galatians what is stopping you from running and being the light for your age in that part of the earth and we know they brought in you know Judaism they brought in the law yeah they brought in things that God did not God did not intend for the Christian church because Paul talks about the law of Faith yep he says that law is what you should be being living by the law of faith and the law of faith is that you receive the word the anointed word you receive it faith comes into your heart you say I believe it amen and then your confession is then worked out in your life amen amen because you say I believe it and something you know you you you have to respond you can't sit there like a piece of plaster on a bench amen you've got to respond God is looking for a response from you amen and our response should always be yes Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen Amen Let It Be unto me according to Thy word because his word will his word is not you know you're going to be in unbelief you're going to be overcome by the enemy you know you're just going to struggle along in life that's not what he wants for us amen that's right I have thoughts towards you there are peace that you may have an expected end what's our expected end a Rapture Made In His Image that's our expected end amen hallelujah so he says you did run well so what happened now an antichrist Spirit came into the galatian church and it hindered their race it hindered them running yes amen but we are called now to lay aside every weight and sin amen that so easily besets us we read in Hebrews 12 we are called he says let us run amen he says let us therefore lay aside every weight and sin that so easily besets us so if he's calling for you to lay aside every weight and sin he gives you the ability now don't fall asleep on me people he gives you the ability to lay aside the weight and every sin that's so easily beset you amen because if if you allow him to change your nature if you allow him to change it now then you won't have the problems you have amen because if God changes your nature it's like you know if I was addicted like once upon a time well you know the story used to make home and all these things I couldn't afford to smoke I was a student but anyway you know H absolutely you know but it's because there was a thirst in me I needed it I needed it so there my nature was I need that because I had a sin nature cuz we're all born with a sin nature amen but that when God took that sin nature out of me I could be living in a brewery and I'd be I'd just be so anyway Hallelujah I don't have to walk and be oh keep it from me I'm scared I don't want to fall into it no if your nature is change and you have no desire and here for it you don't need to fear Hallelujah that's why we he gives you the ability to lay those things aside amen hallelujah amen I'm so glad that's the case hallelujah amen that's right amen now don't let a weight lay aside every weight amen amen amen if you're you know we have to walk in such a way it doesn't matter if Mama don't go or daddy don't go or husband don't go wife don't go or siblings don't go I'm going to go amen amen don't let family pressure hold you back who's who's going to be there at the white Throne judgment is your office are your colleagues going to be there judging you is your family going to be there judging you is your Society going to be standing on the throne oh no sir they won't be there they won't be judging you so why live before them in this life this life is but a vapor amen this life is going to be over very soon that's right praise God it's going to be over amen not because I want to go but this is Brother Bram says this is a this is a pest house we live in a pest house compared to Heaven this is an Absol it's like living on Silver stream dump y amen imagine living there every day of you're like you are Yep this is a pest house but yet the devil shine it up make it seem so appealing it's just a rubbish dump have a pile of trash y it's been sitting in the sun for a few weeks you'll like the aroma he just shines it up here you go and people just rub it all over themselves they oh they love it so much they think it's glorious amen you don't want to people do they wallow in their you know and they are a prison to those things I'm not condemning them you got to understand but they're like a pig and a pig pen you can take a pig you can bring them inside you can call them whatever name you want you can keep them in there you can clean them up you can dress them up you can give them little coats and booties and hats and give them a little bed and give him a little bedroom you know but then whenever it rains and he goes to the window he sees the mud there's something in him says I want to I must have some mud and he looks around the house he can't find any mud but on the outside you look down oh wil you're such a nice little piggy you know cuz he's behaving all nice he's walking around you know scratches belly it's all nice you know but in him he wants to be in that M amen and then one day if the do open when it rains he makes a beeline out for that mud and he does a cannonball into it you know he PSTA bombs the thing and he's in it he's rolling around he's having a jubilee and you could be why Wilbur after I looked after you so much much and I gave you nice booties and hats and they all matching colors you look so manly in your pink you know as a pig and bows and we took all these selfies together doing things and look where you've gone why did he go because his nature wasn't changed amen he couldn't overcome the mud because there was a longing in his soul for the mud amen but if you took Wilbur and you changed his Pig nature into a lamb nature he could walk out there put it on his gum boots walk around outside it's raining there's nothing in him that wants that M he doesn't want to get dirty amen that's right amen he may get splashed once in a while but he want to get it cleaned off yes amen you understand and it's the same thing God can change a nature yes amen amen do not hide behind religion and self uh what do he call it people well being self-righteous that's the word of for I do this I did this I do this no no no lay it aside yeah Amen Let God change you amen but we would now we would in this race there's going to be hard times but don't let the hard times dictate to you how you run amen yeah you say well is it is it is it a run as an as spe no it's your faith our faith should be in good times Hallelujah in bad times I praise him more amen hallelujah when things are just coasting glory amen when it's when it's you know I'm in a ditch and the car's on fire and I just got out Hallelujah because there's no temptation given you which is common to man so people out there receive bad times amen they receive punctures they receive police tickets you know they receive whatever amen you know they have bad bad things happen to them they get sick that's right they get well amen things go well in the family things go bad in the family that's all things that are common to man as I heard brother temp say that's just a grab bag of Life yes bag's open you just grab in oh I've got this that's mine it doesn't but don't let that dictate to you how you run amen because we must understand there is an end to all things not you there's no end to the believer we're Eternal as God is eternal but the trials we Face there's an expiring date amen there is an end to our suffering there's an end to sickness there's an end to unbelief there's an end to doubts there's an end to separation of families and things like that there's an end to things that try and get in amen there's an end to the devil our enem is going to burn I don't even I just no to me I'm not a person of fan fear so to me I just got this and he disappears I'm done that's right why why why allow him to exist sure he's going to he's going to be punished for his sins but but to me he's still existing he's going to come to an end just just get rid of him amen amen I'm not a man of ceremony so just just you know amen and you're gone sweeten what happened I can't even remember him I he's not even worthy of my memory amallah am me he he doesn't even he doesn't even deserve to be remembered amen hallelujah amen and that's how I feel about it why give him that place that's right now so we have to amen Abraham now let's go to Romans chapter 4 and I this is one of my favorite scriptures as well I love Abraham amen Abraham is that's incredible amen he had no Bible he didn't have 1100 odd tapes he didn't have a church he didn't have Ministry to come and say you can do it he didn't have you know he didn't have the internet go and watch watch his favorite preacher On The Backs side the desert of memmory you know all he had was God's voice yes and that's you know all those things are good right just mentioned but it has to be you have to hear the voice behind the voice amen that it's not just the preacher's Voice or the prophet's voice but you can hear the voice of God coming behind that and it quickens something in your life changes you and Abraham's life was changed here he was you know you think in those days and it's still in in some places people didn't move around a lot like in this day and age you know we know half of you all are from from from Africa and you've come over here you know it's like my dad came from Cape Town I was born here but back in the day a few hundred years it didn't really happen that way no amen so Abraham he would have stayed there in what we call Iraq he would have raised his children his Elder son would have become the head of the tribe or a servant whatever more whatever would have happened but they would have stayed there that's where they were but then one day God spoke to him amen leave this place yes I'm going to take you to another place Hallelujah and I don't know what language he spoke to him or how he spoke to him but something gripped his life he be to run Amen brother Braham says there was nothing special about Abraham but God called him that's what made him special amen it's the same thing with us there's nothing special about us but God has called us amen you say well there's nothing special about you the devil says there's nothing special about you you think you're whatever you say but God has called me amen and he's not called me to wrath and destruction but he's called me to came salvation by Jesus Christ that's what he's called me for yes thank you Jesus Hallelujah so he begins to he begins to run now let's but now Abraham came to this spot in Romans 4 and let's go down to I don't want to read just a little bit let's read from verse 13 because I just like this chapter for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith yes for if they which are of the law be ears faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith and that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all seed not to only which is of the law but to that which uh but that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were who against hope now hope is an expectation who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he that had promised he was also able to perform and therefore was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification Hallelujah so Paul is saying here that Abraham he staggered not at the promise now remember he couldn't have a child he's 100 years old his body was now dead Sarah couldn't have the child that's why they had it through hagga few years before this so physically it was impossible I know this is by Elementary but he didn't even bring his own State into account amen he didn't bring his own state so he didn't he didn't here now I'll bring into Monday language he didn't bring his own state of how his family is yes amen where his children may be amen how his walk how he feels his walk with the Lord is going amen how Victorious he thinks he is he didn't bring it how healthy he is how much money he has you know what is what is life's Direction he thinks is going he didn't bring it into account amen are you with me he didn't bring it into account he just lay hold of the promise and said God you you're going to give me the promise son I don't know how it's going to happen but I believe your word hallelujah and that is the same it says that it was imputed that that was done that it would be imputed to us also amen that we would not stagger at the promise don't even if God said it that's it amen if he's promised you something don't work out how it's going to happen how it's going to work out if God said he's going to do it he will take care of the details amen amen he'll take care of the details amen oh Lord hallelujah so so don't look at your own State never look at your own State amen he didn't look at his own State yes he say well I've been going through this trial for years he had 25 years of trial but he still ran amen amen didn't hinder his run amen hallelujah he still ran because there was an end to his barness Ser there there came an end to his barness amen and it's like us when we when we're going through trials and things they will come to an in amen amen just because life is in a certain direction does not mean it will always be that way amen you have to believe that I haven't seen any change day one after the promise Sarah how you feeling nothing Abraham next month no I'm not going to do this for 25 years but you just you'll catch it next month how you feeling Sarah no still nothing next month how you feeling Sarah you think we're going to have eyes praise God we're going to have him no amen you following me yeah how we how are we doing this month jar do you think you feel no I just feel older amen but Abraham was glory to God his promis us the son he's going to come amen doesn't matter remember Sarah didn't believe Sarah had doubt that's why he said take hagga Sarah had doubt but he was still strong in the promise yes amen amen and his faith Faith caused her to believe amen because he kept brother Braham on the PLS of memory they went out they went down and S and the ra well watered PLS of Sodom so things were a bit hard their situation was a bit hard but he kept himself in a spiritual kind of atmosphere hall because Sarah was getting a little bit fussy and he knew hey there may just be the visitation today Hallelujah because he knew the promise became real to him but it wasn't just enough for her to tell for him to tell her it had become personal to Sarah he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere he's sitting under an oak tree he says three men walking Hallelujah he says now is the season it's going to come to an end Hallelujah God came in flesh with two angels and said according to Time Of Life you'll have the promised son amen and then Sarah from that from that time till after that what happens Sarah Sarah believes amen Sarah believed that was her visitation time of life is not time of life as woman that was her visitation he kept in a spiritual atmosphere are you catching what I'm saying he kept in a spiritual atmosphere for her yeah Hallelujah I'm the only one he was the only one that believed I'm the only one in the whole family you may be the only one Mary Mary received the visitation of Gabriel she had no one else to back up her testimony but she had to believe the promise that was given to her she had to believe that she was the one to fulfill Isaiah 9 and six it was a testimony of one and everyone wasn't rejoicing and saying hallelujah praise God the Messiah is going to be born in nine months Hallelujah they're saying she's got an illegitimate child it was a soldier or this or this Joseph just trying to cover up she made opposition did she not she made opposition even Joseph Who Loved Her was going to put away privately the scriptures is she didn't receive not not everyone you know everyone didn't rally and Glory you know here comes the one who's going to deliver us no she received opposition but didn't stop her from running yes yes amen you will receive opposition amen now let's go to let's just go to um oh no I just mentioned this first now brother bradam no when God comes to Abraham as Al shedai he comes to God yeah God comes as alhi to Abraham and that means the basically the the um breasted God like a mother breastfeeds a baby so God was coming and saying just come nurse off me nurse off the promise and it will give you strength for what you need for it to come to pass and it's the same thing with us amen take the promise cuz the same God that met him is the same God present today amen amen I trust when you look into the promise of God it quickens to you amen because it's become alive to you just nurse off the promise because it becomes aive to you God saying that's for you that's your promise and so you just keep that keep it before your face just nurse strength from that promise as it said to the Philippian Jailer believe thine and thy house shall be saved that was the promise of the Philippian jaila and his family came inj Hallelujah you just got to nurse off the promise whatever it is for healing amen by a Stripes I was healed it's for deliverance amen many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them all Hallelujah whatever it may be take the promise and nurse off that promise amen hallelujah Abraham did he had a son amen hallelujah amen so we have a just nurse off the promise brother bam says in Jehovah Gyra in 56 he says God took Abraham uh out when he was 90 and N Abraham was getting old the stream of life was dead in him any man woman knows what I'm speaking Sarah an old woman and Abraham an old man and he had trusted and waited for this promise to be fulfilled then what happened God took him out and appeared to him in another name in the name of God Almighty the 17th chapter of Genesis he appeared to him in the name of God Almighty in the Hebrew it's alai which means the uh the breast of a woman said said Abraham I'm going I'm appearing to you now as the bre breasted one I am the mother you're old your strength is all gone but I am the breasted God in other words your strength is gone but I am the one who can nurse you back to strength again amen hallelujah God Almighty If he if he was that to Abraham he's got to be that to Abraham seed yes amen according to Faith hello Abraham seed he's got to if he was that to Abraham he's got to be that to you yes amen amen for the same promises no matter how sick you are how far you're gone lay a hold of God's Eternal promises and nurse your life back again how far you are in sin how black you are you may be a prostitute from the street but that same promise is to you if you'll dare to take a hold of God's word if you dare I dare you this morning doesn't matter what condition remember people you know someone could be sitting in church all their life and not one step towards God or they can be a child rapist on the street who's a serial killer on top of it and in God's eyes they are in the same boat as I said someone in church who's never made a step towards God and that person they're all in they they're they're all in darkness because if you haven't even just made a step then you haven't even made first base yet yes amen you have haven't even started your walk he hasn't started his walk either but what the enemy has manifested in his life and the person in Church's life it just appears different but they're still in the same category that's right amen I'm using extreme example because the problem is we take a we we we put a level of of this like that person you think he's far away from God and that person's real close but their hearts could just be as far away as each other but humanly we gauge things yes so it doesn't matter if you're in that state or you're in this state amen you're still all in the same boat yes amen amen so never despair where someone may go it it actually doesn't matter amen right it actually doesn't matter they're still in the same boat you understand what they do remember the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't wear thin the more sin it has to eradicate it doesn't it doesn't you know run out or you know the is absolute amen amen it never gets it never gets the you never gets you never gets a time please wait I got to recharge the battery or whatever you know you cannot draw too much juice you understand so don't despair wherever whoever wherever may be it doesn't matter yeah amen amen God can save them look he takes Moses he murdered a guy yes Peter tried to kill a guy with a sword he just wasn't a sword he cut his ear off David was an adulterer David did far worse things than Saul yes far worse but yet he was a man after his own heart you know yes you take all of the that's why there's a reason all of those things are look at Rahab she's a harlot amen she's an enemy of God standing in the inheritance which doesn't belong to her she should have been wiped out as sure as everyone else in Jericho yes amen but when she heard about what God did she called out for Mercy amen amen and she called out for mercy and she received it amen amen so if you call out Jesus saved me Jesus redeemed me amen he will no I cast you out Hallelujah you know and see you know you take there's a reason all those things are written in the Bible cuz it's got to show us it doesn't matter where we're called from it's irrelevant amen it doesn't matter our initial State God has a perfect image of you yes amen amen that he want to mold you into you with me it doesn't matter where you start it's where you're finishing that's the main thing Hallelujah so don't worry about those things just nurse from the promise of God am amen I dare you to get a hold of God Amen if you'll dare to take a hold of God brother uh brother B says now Paul knew what it was like to run as I've said now maybe I'll say this first now brother says and spoken word is the Original Seed and he speaks about the high breeding of the word then God sends another man or you know brings another Revival to bring the people back to the truth he says that's why each generation has its own Revival a chance at the word so The Sovereign God at the Judgment John Wesley's group will raise up and these start was Methodist of today will answer for Luther will raise up the Catholics will raise up back behind irenius Martin po carp and all those to the real Catholics before it became what it is now and we'll and we have to stand in judgment for hybriding the word of God to dogmas and he said now so so every generation has its own Revival he says in the same message a bit further down now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word amen to live a pure word out yes right that every generation has it chance at its own Revival its own chance at the word now I'm saying that is because we are a generation we're over 50 years down the road from when brother Brown was taken off the scene amen and some of us are third fourth generation Believers amen some are right that's Generations down so we can't just rest on The Laurels of all this is what my parents did or my grandparents did we have our chance at the word a chance at our own reev Revival each generation must have its own Revival am amen and we are another generation amen amen we have our chance to take the bad as I said or become the torch amen and run this race amen hallelujah we have a chance we must so why are you saying that take hold of it take hold of this word take hold of this message hallelujah amen and run am amen amen you say well God did heaps of amazing things you know brother braham's life maybe years ago but what about today are my parents met God but what about you yes amen amen now Paul as I said he knew what it was like to he ran we can all agree he ran his race he finished his course he received his crown am mean he passed the Baton on he passed the anointing on to Timothy in the Next Generation down he ran his race well but he had problems he had to endure along along the track yes right and so now even Paul himself now we know he was beaten he was Shipwrecked he was you know he had all those external problems but then also he had a problem uh in his own flesh he says in 2 Corinthians 12:7 unless I should be exalted above the measure through the abundance of the revelations that were given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to Buffet me least I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me this is in Galatians 6:11 ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand and the and the correct interpretation say that the large letters I have written cuz normally cuz he had a blindness thing that would come off and on him right he had this thought in his flesh so he had a sickness in his body that he couldn't get rid of Amen now does that mean he was weak in faith he's the first church age messenger but remember he besought the Lord and the Lord told him this is what it is so he didn't just take it for granted well this is just my lot in life this is what I've pulled out the grab bag of life God told him his grace was sufficient right and so now this Affliction in his body did not stop him from running it didn't dilute his faith it didn't diminish his walk he glor in it he said praise God Amen so I'm saying that because if he can run amen if he can run yes amen and he thought that he would be the generation that the coming of the Lord would come to but he was prophesying of us if he could run with that Affliction and all the hardship he endured how much you and I amen living in a flowery bed of east of this modern society don't let this world lull you to sleep whatever you do don't get comfortable and just well I go to church on Sunday I have my job my family everything's all nice yes that's right remember as I said an athlete an athlete that believes they can win their whole life is around that one goal their whole life their whole life and in its entirety not part of it not time what they eat down to the killer amen how much they sleep yes hallelujah how much they train amen when they train what they train on it's all down to a fine detail because they have one race Hallelujah and their whole life is rearranged about that goal amen and people admire them for it amen people admire oh there goes my hero running the hund incredible you know people but then you take it into the Christian realm that's just the naturals you read it's just they obtain a corruptible Crown there'll come a day when those things are not remembered anymore hey I admire you know it's amazing people can do that kind of stuff but that's not that's not the race we're called to run amen they put all of their ambition the the mental toughness that they have you know it's not just a ha hasard thing that they just like a stab in the dark their whole life is focused on that goal their whole entire life yes amen and they give years some of you know more than my you know better than me about but they give years of their lives just for one race just for one race and then now you'll see people and the world you take a devout believer amen who's running the race and their whole life is revolving yes Glory their whole life is revolving about this race they're running amen what they do with their time amen amen what they eat what they wear where they go what they do what they think amen amen hallelujah and You' look at them and say that's a fanatic and you'd say absolutely Hallelujah I'm a fanatic for Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah because there's a race that I must run there's a victory to be won amen because to me because like if you look on I'm sure people do they say you guys are crazy you're weird just just relax imagine telling someone who's who believes by their previous races they're going to win the 100 at the next Olympics imagine telling that person just relax you're going a bit overboard yeah you know do you really need to just come and enjoy I don't know do you have to why do you have to get up at 4 in the morning and train just sleep in that's not normal the world is not open at that time you know he would he or she would look at you and say are you mad I'm going to win I'm going to win I have the ability to win they think you're crazy yeah and then we allow this world to look at us and we think oh I hope they don't think all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall what suffer persecution amen it doesn't say all that live God in Christ Jesus even want to love amen we just got to come to peace with that not everyone will love us the spirit in this world hates us it wants to destroy us amen but greater is he that's in the that is he that is in the world Amen so we shouldn't worry about I'm sorry I believe I'm going to win I believe I'm going to win it's been revealed to me I'm going to win Hallelujah I've got a crown waiting for me in the other land amen I'm going to walk streets of gold I believe I'm going to do it I am amen so if I believe that then then my whole life should show I'm going to win amen amen amen you with me amen amen you know you can't Jesus never rebuked his disciples for being too fast to believe yeah he said oh fools and slow of heart to believe Luke 24 you know so he never he never people who are you know enthused about it remember if you're a really if you have a real heart I mean if you have real ambition you want to take everyone with you amen and God give us wisdom to do it but you see so it won't make you weird in that way way you understand but you know he never rebuked his disciples for going being overboard right we don't think the people I'm just laboring this point because in the Olympics we don't think the world does not think those people are overboard right you know they do not think no one thinks they're overboard they think hey good on them Bravo I want to see you do it that's right that's the same thing yeah but you got to take that into Christianity but everyone thinks we're overboard everyone thinks you're just crazy no there's a Finish Line there's a crown of gold there's a race amen that I'm going to run amen hallelujah do not worry about now I'm just going to read a few things do not worry when hardship comes yes right as I said there's no temptation given which is common to man that you suffer we all receive hard times yes right and it says now rejoice in Hope patient and tribulation continuing inant in prayer Romans 12:2 and then John 16 and33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation this is Jesus speaking but be of good cheer I have overcome the world so he says you are going to have tribulation am mean you're going to have hard times but be of good cheer because I have overcome the worldj Hallelujah so we don't need to worry as I said don't worry about what hardships you go through don't let it stop you from running the race right amen amen and we we understand now that all see it says in uh Corin I think it's Colossians 4:17 No 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light Affliction right which is but for a moment worketh in us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so he says but this light Affliction but is but for a moment amen so any hardship or trial or anything go through it is but for a moment amen do not let the devil put into your mind that this is your portion in life this is how you're going to be and there's no changing it yes amen never hold on to that amen it is but a light of fliction and it is but for a moment amen hallelujah that's what he this is what he said now 1 Peter 5:10 but the God of all peace who have called us unto his eternal uh Glory by Christ Jesus after ye have suffered a while a while what's a while a space of time amen uh make you perfect establish strength and settle you amen so he's saying that there' be suffering just a while there comes a time when suffering comes to an end I'm not just talking when these bodies are changed I'm talking about an everyday life there comes an end of a season I mean we are creatures of time we just had apparently summer and now we're in Autumn which is very much here and then we're really going to experience winter and there might be spring I don't know and then there might be summer again but there's a change in season right and it's like natural life there's always a changeing season amen it's not always a continuous cycle of defeat and darkness and unbelief but God is the cycle breaker amen and he is present to break because whatever cycle of night time you may be in it doesn't mean it's always going to be night it doesn't mean it's always going to be worry and strife that is but a season amen and you must always look at and say this is but a season amen and God is going to remember God doesn't send you through a trial he leads you through a trial he is our Shepherd is he your Shepherd this morning and and the Shepherd in the Eastern countries they don't send a bunch of dogs chase the Sheep through a they call their sheep by name and they lead they're in the front and they're leading the sheep and the Sheep follow them and the Sheep know exactly who they are and the Sheep know who their Shepherd is amen so it's whenever and so it's wherever he leads us yes amen I'll follow because if he's led me into the pit he won't leave me in the pit he wants to take me up the outer side if he takes me through the flood I'll go if it's over mountains I'll go because he won't leave you there remember the destination is not the trial the destination is Glory Hallelujah you got to remember that always remember that yes sir amen hallelujah now he says in he says now he says in James 5:10 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience Glory behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of Job and have and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy amen so he say take these things as examples they they were they suffered Affliction but they didn't stay in the Affliction remember the remember the uh Hebrews 11 it says they all died in faith receiving not the promise we about so it doesn't matter ultimately what state we are when we go as long as we're in faith amen it doesn't matter day by day what may be happening around us as long as we are in faith amen amen now I want to go to let's go to 2 Samuel 22 let's read this together all these things are but for a season yes believe me amen amen you weren't always you're like childhood was a season yes young adult middle age wherever you are it is but a season good times are but a season bad times are but a season amen and God is Not Afraid remember if he led you through if he's your Shepherd he does not lose one sheep yes amen he doesn't he doesn't take you through a great big Ravine and it gets too bad and and he climbs up and leaves you hanging true amen he's a if if he is your Shepherd amen amen amen I there's got to be something in you saying the Lord is my shepherd amen and if he will he will lead me and he will not leave me amen you say Lord you may say well I don't know where I'm going you got to trust the shepherd you got to trust the shepherd as I said a while I don't know when it was but remember a sheep doesn't have the brain of a of of the shepherd does he the Sheep think like sheep has grass here's whatever whatever they think about I don't know but they they must think about something yeah and the shepherd He got a human mind he's looking at his sheep looking at the condition of his sheep how many sheep there are where are the Lambs where are the use you know uh where's where's better pasture what's the quality of this pasture here I need to move them here tomorrow you know maybe they need to be dagged or whatever it is you know he's looking at those things I mean you understand so he's looking Beyond but the Sheep is just grass I don't like that grass this is good you know walking around there's Bob there's Jim how you doing bear you know walking around that's that's different thinking but if the sheep can have confidence of this guy on two legs that this guy's thoughts are greater than my thoughts his ways are greater than my ways he has my best interest in mine amen because a Good Shepherd doesn't lose sheep a bad Shepherd loses sheep and remember he says I give my life for my sheep that's how much he wants to hold it he says I will not lose one amen so if the Sheep actually if if they have the revelation this guy yes amen this humanoid guy I don't know what is this guy knows more than me he leads me to the best grass he looks after me amen he wants to take care of me then when danger comes all they need do is look at the shepherd and stay by the shepherd and if they stay by the shepherd they'll be fine but if they try and take take things into their own hands yes not a good way amen so the Sheep don't necessar understand the quality of the grass is like this now oh now it's going to be winter soon where to go up in the hills are down the valley they might understand that but they understand this guy's looking after me I'll follow him it's the same thing in this life I don't understand where am I going you may not he doesn't sit down and say well here's the here's the workload for today now today there won't be any milk in the fridge and you get a call that you have to owe this much money to this person and your T car's going to break down here but I'll give you something good in the middle middle of the day you know and then um by in the afternoon this may happen and this trial this is going to lead for next week but it's going to be resolved this way and you won't be looking but this is what's going to happen it's going to fix it all he doesn't tell you those things does he tell he doesn't give you a schedule you just wake up Hallelujah glory to God I got another day thank you Lord Jesus amen hallelujah here I am I commit my life to you and then he leads you through it amen does he not so you know you don't need to as long as you have confidence in the shepherd amen well but we're in a little dark place Mr Shepherd don't worry it's all right Hallelujah keep walking I'm going to lead you through hallelujah hallelujah amen now 2 Samuel 2228 and The Afflicted people thou will save but mine eyes are upon the haunty that thou mayest bring them down for thou art my lamp O Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness for by Thee I will run through a troop and by my God have I leapt over a wall as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord has tried I'm glad it's been tried and proven he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like H's feet and Seth me upon high places he teaches My Hands to War and and so that a bow of Steel is broken by mine arms thou Hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great thou has enlarged my steps unto me so that my feet did not slip I have pursued my enemies remember it's a race but you've got to sometimes the opposition you lap them but in this race you can kill your opposition you can cast them down Hallelujah I pursued my enemies have destroyed them and turn not again until I had consumed them I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yay they are Fallen under my feet amen so how do you do that you've got to reckon your enemy dead amen Jesus didn't just take your sins to Calvary he took your enemy to Calvary Amen brother said that the devil's like an animal with a broken back because of Calvary yes amen so he took his enemy he he wasn't just dealing with you he dealing with Satan because now the death penalty that was on You Came Upon your enemy Hallelujah and he conquered hell death in the grave amen and it's still conquered today it's still conquered today so if he has been defeated then your enemy you take him to Calvary and say look at this remember this day he remembers that day hey you'd remember if your back got broken you'd remember that day real well and you'd remember it even more if there's nothing to heal your back Hallelujah cuz there's nothing to heal his back friends amen so you've got to take him back there and reckon him dead and walk on believing he is dead because your faith as I said will either paralyze the world Amen or the world will paralyze your faith that's right amen like brother baram he had the vision of the black mumber snake amen and he had the power to bind the snake and to loose the snake isn't that right and then some yo you don't want to he just he loosed it remember it was chasing all these people and then he bound it and then he said that that I may know that I have power not just to bind but to loose I loose you Satan he didn't just let it loose and chase her and bite people he bound it straight away again amen so you don't just you don't want to lose Satan you want to keep him bound amen you follow me your faith will bind the mumber amen amen your faith will bind don't loosen by unbelief don't loosen by unbelief by keep them Bound By Faith yes amen amen cuz you have remember you have the ability to run he's given you the ability in this message is the ability to run so in this message is the ability to bind the serpent hallelujah amen so keep him bound amen he's not a play thing keep him Bound by your faith Hallelujah now let's go to Psalms 119 and 50 now I'm nearly done this is my comfort and my Affliction that Thy word hath quickened me this is David this is my comfort and my Affliction uh that Thy word hath quickened me or made me alive this is my comfort yes amen because you have to recognize if God called you there he called Abraham follow him yeah I'll take you to another land he didn't leave him halfway yes he didn't leave him halfway amen he brought I know this is probably very well oh well du of course he didn't leave him halfway but sometimes we think oh I've been called and then we get into a little of bit Jagged place and then you begin to think am I going to make it through where has he called you from here and now you're here he'll take you there amen amen amen you just got to remember that that cuz that should be your comfort and affliction is that his word is Quicken you amen it is the messages come to Quicken an elect SE amen because you are said you've been quickened hallelujah amen we don't become Sons or Daughters of God because we get quickened it's because we are Sons and Daughters we get quickened amen amen amen amen you Lord amen why does conviction come upon us because we are Sons and Daughters amen amen why is there that still small voice saying you should follow me amen because you are Sons or daughters now it says in Psalms 39 and9 many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord deliver him out of them all am mean so many of the afflictions not a few many amen many are the afflictions don't let these things I've been Afflicted don't let it hinder your run am don't let it hinder your race amen amen doesn't matter what we're afflicted by it says there'll be many but the Lord delivers out of them all amen so he doesn't deliver them out of some that's right that's why don't get it in your mind well I just this is just me and this is how it's always going to be who says who says that's the devil talking to you and he doesn't know he doesn't know God just wants to prove his word amen and you amen hallelujah amen amen many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers him out of them all allise amen put that on your fridge amen amen now Psalms 30 and5 for his anger endureth but a moment amen some because sometimes God gets angry at us amen but he gets angry at us because we're his children he wants to correct us amen so you should you should be happy when he when he when he checks you amen amen because if he doesn't check you you just continue going on and where's that going to lead amen for his anger endureth but for a but a moment in his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning so there's a change in season when the sun comes up praise God Hallelujah so it's only a period of time amen amen all these things are just a period of time and then now where you say well should I you know I'm in this hard spot and I'm going to try and close say well I'm in this hard spot remember and you know we should never confess what we believe we are we should never confess what you think you are your I mean your current state that's what I mean by that amen amen because it say in Joel 3 and10 beat your plow shares into swords and your pruny hooks into Spears let the weak say I am strong amen so saying say well you know so you should never never have a negative testimony never have a negative testimony it doesn't matter what state you may be in or what you think you're in never confess where you currently areall I feel far away from God never confess that amen amen I don't think I'm going to make it never confess that amen amen never confess that because he says let the weak say I am strong yes because your faith and your confession will bring your life subject to what you say Amen so we should never say you know never have a negative never have a negative thought don't you know the devil can send them into your mind but it's up to you are you going to let it Nest are you going to let it nest in your mind and take over your thoughts you know I've had this you know you just get down on this real thought kind of cycle you know and and I've actually had this well what if my kids die you know what are we going to say no honestly you think what happens if oh there's a car wreck in my children did you know or or my wonderful wife you know what you know what like where are we going to have the funeral who's going to take the funeral what would I say how would I live on you and you get through this big yes why that's a negative thought you know who's you don't have to put your hands up but that I've had that thought and it's been quite a detailed kind of plan and you don't feel happy when you do it but it's because you have genuine care and love for your family yes but

thee according to Thy word Lord and the Philippian jila it said believe and thine and thy house shall be saved and him in his house receive salvation because he believed he could have thought this is a c they won't believe me we just had an earthquake these guys have been singing now I've embraced this new crazy religion that everyone's talking against amen if he thought about that he would have been the only one and he wouldn't have been his faith would never have been strong amen but if he received it as it was meant to be as he did they came in amen you with me amen Amen brother Braham says now he says this is a greater than Solomon is here in the 12th chapter of St Matthew's gospel 24th verse um and he says um he says I wish to read for a moment these words it's a little text I've read many times spoke on it the reason I've taken it tonight is because I could hurry with it to get to the point that I wish to get to before prayer for the sick and while I'm praying and speaking on want every person in here to have this in your mind for as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building don't have nothing else on your mind keep thinking that if there's any praise if there's any virtue think on these things so what is so if there's any praise what's that Lord my family's coming in Lord I'm going to be delivered Lord my Help Cometh From You Lord You're the strength Giver you're the lifegiver Lord you are my God Amen you are my God Jesus L amen think on those things that gives praise hallelujah amen Lord you've taken the book for me amen you've laid claim on me I've been redeemed Hallelujah those things demand don't they when you think about those glorious the lamb step Jesus going up Calvary hallelujah

he's carrying my sin up the hill Hallelujah I can go to glory after this amen he's got poor Spirit out because he died he's carrying you say go go Jesus go Hallelujah go Messiah Hallelujah you would have been having a glorious time Hallelujah and then he says it's finished you say oh thank you Lord hallelujah oh my that would have been the happiest people if they knew what was going on doesn't that give you praise amen hallelujah then he sends Elijah to the Earth in the end time find me a bride Hallelujah I'm going to turn their hearts back the original faith I'm going to open my word hallelujah I'm going to show them they in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah amen I'm going to show you the great mystery in my mind I'm going to shout to them I'm going to put my mind in a people hallelujah they're not just walking around in darkness but they know in whom they have believed hallah I'm going to tell them I'm coming soon I'm going to change their bodies Hallelujah that my blood can do anything that gives Praise In My Soul hallelujah hallelujah praise why are the prayer lines recorded cuz God wanted to show you there's no enemy I have not defeated or Hallelujah it can be a sickness it can be a spiritual it can be even God's great power of taking a stubborn nature who cannot forgive and God can change it in a moment Hallelujah that's why those things are recorded yes God's showing I'm a deliverer I can deliver from anything amen that's why I get beside myself I think God you can do anything there's nothing you can't do what are you going to do today Lord I don't know Hallelujah I'm not beside myself he can do anything anything at all all is anything too hard for God oh but my state Hallelujah and when I think of that I don't think what I think I am is there anything to have for the Lord hallelujah he could do he could do anything you just think anything anything anything like anything like make a new world and I could go live on it anything Hallelujah he can do anything he wants amen he's not limited Hallelujah think on those things Hallelujah glory to God now and remember don't let your thinking change that's right because you say well I received it in church and I was rejoicing but now I'm out the doors I don't know no cast I that down amen keep the promise you say I received it in here I'm going to keep walking brother say about if you're sick you have an image of a perfect healthy strong person and you walk into that image you keep that image by his stripes I was healed It's Already Done amen hallelujah amen praise God now Hallelujah he says you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought this where I was want to get to this quote you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought he that cometh to God must believe that he is and is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen amen that's a scripture remember he says also in um in God using his gift in 56 you know when you think about God when you keep your mind oh you'll think you sit in church and think about anything else but God how are you going to how you going to go do your washing what you going to do at the office tomorrow how are you going to do this and that keep your mind off that and think on God right the Bible says if there will be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things I wonder um and and then he says I wonder if I'll be called on the prayer line I wonder if God will speak don't think that kind of negative thoughts amen don't let that go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive see amen amen think on those things remember fear has no what's the point of worrying about anything amen y true I know fear is real we we get worried about things how are we going to how's this going to pan out don't fear yep amen fear has no virtue believe God will meet the need am well because there's no virtue in fear but there isn't Faith why is that because he can do it amen amen he can do it so
