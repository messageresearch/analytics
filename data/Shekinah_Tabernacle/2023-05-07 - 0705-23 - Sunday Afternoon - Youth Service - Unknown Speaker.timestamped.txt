[25:15] [Music]
[25:20] [Applause]
[25:23] [Music]
[26:12] [Music]
[26:20] if you could um just turn to your Bibles
[26:22] to Leviticus
[26:24] chapter 25 and 10.
[26:27] and I'm going to talk about the pardon
[26:30] today
[26:31] I mean so in Leviticus 25 and 10 it says
[26:34] here and ye shall Hollow the 50th year
[26:37] and Proclaim Liberty
[26:40] throughout all the land unto all the
[26:43] inhabitants thereof
[26:45] it shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[26:47] shall return every man unto his position
[26:50] and ye shall return every man unto his
[26:53] family
[26:54] I mean so we all know that to announce
[26:58] the the Jubilee there was a trumpet
[27:00] sounded
[27:01] amen so when that iul have your seats
[27:04] when that trumpet sounded all the slaves
[27:07] they all got to go free
[27:09] so and and you know they could go back
[27:12] to their their family and their
[27:14] inheritance
[27:15] and the main reason that everyone got to
[27:17] go free was because was just they needed
[27:21] a place of Refuge and um otherwise I'd
[27:24] be in this property so this was you know
[27:26] as we all know just the Israelites who
[27:28] were basically as all voluntarily they
[27:31] were in slavery
[27:34] amen so you know I could imagine you
[27:36] know there may have been a man with his
[27:38] his wife and children
[27:40] you know and um and perhaps the place
[27:42] that they were living in was going
[27:43] through a time of of drought
[27:46] amen and you know and in times of
[27:49] drought a lot of people used to probably
[27:50] back in that day they run out of money
[27:51] and you know if this guy had things on
[27:54] tick on finance you know perhaps his
[27:57] farm he had a bit of a mortgage and fall
[27:59] as his old plows and stuff
[28:02] maybe as oxen he would have eventually
[28:04] run out of money and then you know he
[28:06] could probably no longer support his
[28:08] family his wife and his children
[28:11] so then this man would basically be
[28:13] forced to voluntarily sign himself over
[28:16] to to slavery I don't quite know who it
[28:18] was for I think it may have been for the
[28:20] people he owed money to but anyways um
[28:23] so you know perhaps it was the 40th year
[28:24] saying you that you know he he would be
[28:27] in slavery for 10 years
[28:30] so you know he probably he would have
[28:32] signed himself over and then he would
[28:34] have he would have worked quite hard
[28:36] to you know and there would have
[28:37] probably been a percentage of that money
[28:38] would have gone to his family and stuff
[28:40] and he would probably have to go to the
[28:41] next you know move to another
[28:43] to another place and go live there and
[28:45] work there so some of those people might
[28:47] not have seen their families you know
[28:48] for 10 years but you know that man would
[28:51] have been looking forward to that 50th
[28:53] year I'm sure he would have been he
[28:54] would have been really looking forward
[28:56] to it and then when that trumpet finally
[28:58] sounded that man walk free
[29:01] I mean his debt paid off and he could
[29:03] return to his family and you know we we
[29:05] came from and stuff and that that
[29:08] Jubilee it's at that was a pardon yeah
[29:11] because you know a pardon means this is
[29:14] the noun the action of forgiving or
[29:16] being forgiven for an error or offense
[29:19] so that man may have had still heaps of
[29:21] money owing no he probably they him you
[29:24] know he wouldn't have worked at all off
[29:27] but as soon as that trumpet sounded all
[29:29] the debt was cleared and he could walk
[29:31] straight through I mean he was he was
[29:32] completely completely set free
[29:36] I mean he didn't it was a free pardon he
[29:37] didn't have to pay for anything he
[29:39] didn't have to pay for that trumpet to
[29:40] blow it was all free it just came free
[29:43] to him
[29:45] but there were some slaves that they
[29:48] didn't you know they didn't they
[29:50] basically said I would I just want to
[29:51] say a slave I like it here you know that
[29:53] this is where I find my identity
[29:56] working for someone anyway so you know
[29:58] they they didn't accept it
[30:00] and they got their ears pulled through
[30:02] and they were became forever slaves they
[30:04] they could never leave even if they
[30:06] wanted to that was them
[30:09] and this was a true story and night uh
[30:11] 1830
[30:13] um this was over in the states there
[30:15] were two men one was um a mailman called
[30:17] George Wilson the other James Porter
[30:19] robbed a mail carrier so do you guys
[30:21] know what a mail carrier is you have you
[30:24] if for any of you don't you may have
[30:25] read like a cowboy an Indian book when
[30:28] you were younger and there were like
[30:29] those stage coaches they're all the
[30:31] Apaches and all the Indians and all you
[30:33] know Jesse James and Lynnwood Rob
[30:36] anyways yeah so they robbed one of those
[30:38] but these these Two Fellas got caught
[30:41] and they were both scheduled to be
[30:43] hanged
[30:44] so
[30:46] they're going to be executed and James
[30:48] Porter got executed on schedule
[30:52] so Andy unfortunately he went first and
[30:54] then but George had some very
[30:55] influential friends and and the
[30:58] Parliament where um the president was
[31:01] and they managed to get to Andrew
[31:03] Jackson who was the president at that
[31:04] time
[31:06] and they basically got Andrew Jackson to
[31:09] write up this man George Wilson a a
[31:11] pardon that he would only spend 20 years
[31:15] in in prison so but it seems like a long
[31:18] time but it's better than being you know
[31:20] hanged getting executed that way so
[31:23] anyway so but funnily enough George
[31:25] Wilson didn't accept the pardon
[31:29] so the case went before The Supreme
[31:30] Court and they there was a man that um
[31:33] who was the head of the Supreme Court
[31:35] John he basically wrote that a pardon
[31:38] cannot be forced upon someone a part it
[31:42] must be accepted if not it has no power
[31:46] I mean so this this man didn't accept
[31:48] his pardon and therefore you know he he
[31:50] got executed
[31:52] so yes they must and needs to be
[31:55] accepted you can't just get a pardon and
[31:57] force it upon someone who doesn't work
[31:59] that way a pardon is accepted
[32:02] yeah it must be
[32:04] but the Lord has the pardon as well I
[32:08] mean so not not we were just talked
[32:10] about a natural pardon that a president
[32:11] wrote but the Lord Jesus Christ has has
[32:15] a pardon for us
[32:18] and I have a quote here from Brother
[32:20] Branham says we're all Sinners but the
[32:23] only way we can be saved is by accepting
[32:26] the Lord Jesus and his free pardon
[32:30] amen
[32:32] and have another quote Christ took every
[32:34] place and freed us from every Affliction
[32:37] and every sin that the devil put us in
[32:41] the prison house why
[32:42] Christ come to Pardon us freely
[32:46] I mean
[32:48] now I can look I look here at an ex
[32:51] in chapter 26 Paul Paul went to see King
[32:54] Agrippa
[32:55] and anyways he he was brought before him
[32:57] and then Paul told king of gruffa you
[33:00] know everything he'd been through
[33:02] how he met the Lord how he planned to go
[33:05] places and tell more people about the
[33:07] Lord you know continue on
[33:08] his missionary work
[33:11] and anyways while he was saying this
[33:14] there's someone interrupted and based um
[33:16] called Paul MADD
[33:18] IE but then Paul Paul's like to Ken
[33:19] Griffey he's like hey man I know that
[33:21] you believe everything that I've this
[33:23] isn't what he's it isn't exactly what he
[33:25] said but this is trying to put it in in
[33:27] terms um I I you know I know that you
[33:31] believe everything I've said is true
[33:33] except he basically told him accept the
[33:35] Lord Jesus as your savior and in Acts 26
[33:37] 28 then Agrippa said unto Paul almost
[33:41] thou persuade us me to be a Christian
[33:44] amen so this man he he had his part and
[33:48] it was right there but he didn't accept
[33:49] it and you know the for for whatever
[33:52] reason it may have been his friends you
[33:54] know who thought he would have been the
[33:55] same as Paul he would also be mad but
[33:57] because because you know because of that
[33:59] peer pressure he sort of he folded
[34:02] didn't accept it
[34:06] and anyways King agrappa basically went
[34:09] and got ball and
[34:11] um threw him prison under a centurion
[34:14] that was in his band
[34:17] but to those that do accept the pardon
[34:19] they get blessed amen you you will come
[34:22] to find out that you never had a start
[34:24] and you never have an End Amen and you
[34:27] shall live eternally with the God who
[34:29] granted you and that sounds kind of cool
[34:34] and you know all the all the effects of
[34:36] sin and all that you know they they have
[34:39] no more hold on you and then you know
[34:40] the devil can't drag you back down you
[34:43] know down to Hell
[34:45] I mean
[34:47] but you know I'd like to ask you have
[34:48] you know have have you received the
[34:50] Lord's pardon and its fullness you know
[34:52] because you know if you receive the
[34:54] party you don't just succeed accept a
[34:56] little piece I just accept
[34:58] eternal life for you know I just accept
[34:59] this little but you know you have to
[35:01] accept all of the word amen
[35:05] amen so I trust you all truly blessed
[35:07] I'd just like to leave it there
[35:10] and thank you
[35:11] [Applause]
[35:25] I mean
[35:28] it's just sing a course

[39:07] name amen thank you musicians
[39:10] [Music]
[39:11] uh let's just turn our Bibles to a
[39:14] Genesis 1 verse 1.
[39:30] the Bible says in the beginning God
[39:33] created the Heaven and the Earth
[39:35] and the Earth was it was it was without
[39:37] form and void and darkness was upon the
[39:40] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[39:42] moved upon the face of the waters
[39:45] and then let's just turn to John 3 verse
[39:48] 3 as well
[40:03] the Bible says Jesus answered and said
[40:06] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[40:08] accept the man be born again he cannot
[40:11] see the kingdom of God
[40:13] Nicodemus saith unto him
[40:15] actually now we'll stop right there and
[40:17] then I'm just Ephesians 2
[40:20] um verse 4.
[40:34] the Bible says but God who is rich in
[40:37] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[40:39] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[40:41] hath quickened us together with Christ
[40:43] by grace are ye saved
[40:46] you can have your seats
[40:48] ah this is just going to be a very
[40:50] simple Sunday school lesson if you like
[40:53] so I trust it's a blessing
[40:57] um we can see here in Genesis 1 verse 1
[41:00] where the Bible talks about what says in
[41:02] the beginning God created the heavens
[41:04] and the Earth
[41:05] and brother Brian says
[41:07] um he created the heavens and the Earth
[41:09] full stop and what happened between then
[41:12] and the next verse and the Earth was
[41:14] without form and void and darkness was
[41:16] upon the face of the deep we don't know
[41:19] um
[41:22] but the way brother Brandon describes
[41:23] how the earth was formed he he described
[41:26] describes it as God first created the
[41:29] Sun
[41:30] and then
[41:32] from the sun he created the Stars he
[41:34] describes it like a cinder or a clinker
[41:36] flinging off from the Sun and that was
[41:39] the first star and in the next one and
[41:41] then he led an earth-sized clinker fly
[41:45] from the Sun and the clinker fell and he
[41:47] said stop
[41:48] and um
[41:50] the the clinker stopped and that was the
[41:52] Earth
[41:53] but at that point it was just a ball of
[41:56] ice this is how brother Reynold
[41:57] describes it it was nothing there was no
[42:00] form to it was just a ball of ice
[42:02] and um and then God brought that ball of
[42:06] ice back closer to the Sun and started
[42:08] making it spin revolve and the water's
[42:11] melted
[42:12] and
[42:13] brother am says theirs where you find
[42:16] where the Bible says the Earth was
[42:18] without form and void
[42:20] and I just want to read a quote to you
[42:24] in the full seal by the band says
[42:28] I was talking to a person not long ago
[42:30] trying to discuss with me and saying
[42:31] aren't you ashamed to say that the that
[42:34] God created the heavens and the Earth in
[42:37] three days
[42:38] in six days
[42:41] I said that's what the Bible said said
[42:43] well we got evidence and can prove that
[42:45] the world is millions of years old
[42:47] I said that didn't have anything to do
[42:49] with it in Genesis 1 verse 1 that said
[42:51] in the beginning God created the heavens
[42:53] and the Earth period That's all seen now
[42:56] the world was without form and void and
[42:59] I said I believe every seed was laying
[43:01] right there from some other civilization
[43:02] or something
[43:04] and as soon as the water lifted off and
[43:06] the light Struck it up come the trees
[43:08] and everything
[43:10] um but then can you take it back to that
[43:12] first slide yeah that's just how I just
[43:15] how brother Brown describes that ball of
[43:17] ice
[43:19] so brother Branham here talks about a
[43:22] previous civilization
[43:25] um on the Earth
[43:27] and that likely was when all the
[43:28] dinosaurs and things were here and and
[43:30] there may have even been people we don't
[43:32] know
[43:33] but for whatever reason that came to an
[43:36] end and then the Earth came to a state
[43:37] where it was without form and void and
[43:40] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[43:43] and
[43:45] that's like our lives
[43:47] um our Earth we we we had a past life we
[43:51] were dead in sins and trespasses and you
[43:55] don't necessarily need to have been out
[43:57] there drinking and partying to have
[44:00] um to to have your for your Earth to be
[44:02] without form and void like you can just
[44:05] not be born again yet and not having
[44:08] given your life to God yet and your
[44:09] Earth is without form and void
[44:13] and you might be you might be not that
[44:17] didn't well dead and sins and trespasses
[44:18] but
[44:19] then unbelief just doing your own thing
[44:22] not serving God
[44:24] but like brother Brown says that seed
[44:27] those seeds that God brought forth was
[44:30] already in the earth and so that seed of
[44:33] God's already in you
[44:35] and
[44:37] that seed has to come out if it's in you
[44:39] it has to come out amen just like the
[44:41] earth the earth didn't basically have a
[44:43] choice
[44:45] um the Lord brought it forth he spoke
[44:47] over the Earth and that seed was brought
[44:49] forth so
[44:51] whether you run a long time or were you
[44:53] give an easy coming you're going to come
[44:55] basically
[45:03] and you know it's like we've heard over
[45:05] the pulpit a lot it takes the right
[45:07] atmosphere you need to be in the right
[45:09] atmosphere to to for that seed to grow
[45:13] um
[45:16] and brother Brown is here and um
[45:18] a ceremony says then God said to the
[45:21] Holy Ghost we'll just take it in simple
[45:23] form now you go forth and you go to
[45:25] making love to that world because I'm
[45:28] love and you're a product of me so now
[45:30] you go and make love to the world
[45:33] uh
[45:34] and the big Holy Ghost we think coming
[45:36] out there just in picture form now it
[45:39] wasn't that way of course the Holy Ghost
[45:41] and God is the self-same person
[45:44] pardon me and just say he throwed his
[45:47] wings around the earth and he began to
[45:49] brooding
[45:50] what's that brooding like the hint of a
[45:53] chicken's cooing and making love Gluck
[45:55] cluck cluck
[45:56] oh life come forth he screamed he looked
[45:59] around I want Beauty on this Earth come
[46:02] forth light the Holy Ghost are moving
[46:04] and when he did by look coming there's a
[46:07] creaking down the hill Yonder somewhere
[46:11] Yonder some calcium pouring down and
[46:13] mixtures with potash what's it folding
[46:15] into life come forth and a little Easter
[46:19] flower stuck his head up from a rock
[46:21] from under a rock come here father look
[46:24] at that
[46:25] that looks good just keep on brooding he
[46:28] brewed out the flowers he brought out
[46:30] the vegetation he brought out the animal
[46:32] life the birds flew out of the dust and
[46:35] after a while up come a man and a woman
[46:37] upcoming man and the man was both man
[46:40] and woman and the creation goes on
[46:43] and it's you know our lives is like that
[46:46] wherever we found ourselves
[46:49] um God knew exactly where you were who
[46:52] you are and he's brooding over you like
[46:55] might not even feel it but he's there
[46:58] and he's brooding over you and he's
[46:59] loving you
[47:00] and eventually that sea will come come
[47:03] come forth and God will turn your Void
[47:07] Earth into a beautiful Earth with plants
[47:09] and creatures
[47:14] brother Branham says that's how we got
[47:16] Jesus is because it's because that God
[47:18] loved the world something was produced
[47:20] because of his love and Jesus the Savior
[47:22] was produced that grand old story
[47:26] and
[47:28] and you know the creation didn't happen
[47:30] overnight it was a process God created
[47:33] was created over time and you might not
[47:36] see everything in your life straight
[47:37] away it's a work in progress
[47:40] but but it's happening and it can't stop
[47:43] from happening
[47:45] um as I said earlier you know the Earth
[47:47] couldn't stop itself from being changed
[47:49] it couldn't change itself
[47:51] God had to change it
[47:54] and as a son and daughter of God I'm so
[47:57] thankful that we can't stop his work in
[47:59] our lives like we might have our ups and
[48:00] downs
[48:02] um it doesn't matter it doesn't it
[48:03] doesn't actually matter
[48:09] and
[48:12] you know God spoke to that Earth and he
[48:13] said let there be
[48:15] and what each one of us needs is God to
[48:17] speak in our lives and say Let There Be
[48:20] and and it'll bring forth and you know
[48:23] if he speaks to the Earth it has to
[48:25] bring forth it might take time but it
[48:28] has to come forth
[48:30] the Bible says he hath made all things
[48:32] beautiful in his time
[48:36] can we just turn to Romans chapter 8
[48:39] verse 28 as a bit of a lengthy reading
[48:42] there
[49:02] the Bible says and we know that all
[49:04] things work together for good to them
[49:05] that love God to them who are the call
[49:07] according to his purpose
[49:09] I mean there's a there's a purpose in
[49:12] our lives there's um it's more than just
[49:14] existing and maybe having a family and
[49:17] dying it's more than that it's um you
[49:20] know
[49:21] Our Lives compared to Eternity is
[49:23] actually such a small little window like
[49:25] it's nothing it's just a burn prick
[49:27] really
[49:30] who for whom he did for now he also to
[49:32] predestinate to be conformed to the
[49:34] image of a son that he might be the
[49:36] firstborn among many brethren
[49:39] moreover whom he'd predestinate them he
[49:41] also called and whom he called them he
[49:43] also Justified and whom we Justified the
[49:45] India also glorified what shall we say
[49:48] then do these things if God before us
[49:50] who can be against us how can our Earth
[49:52] stay void and and just water
[49:57] he that spared not his own son but
[49:59] delivered him up for us all
[50:00] how shall he not with them also freely
[50:03] give us all things
[50:05] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[50:07] God's elect it is God that justifieth
[50:11] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[50:13] that died yea rather that is risen again
[50:15] who is even at the right hand of God who
[50:17] also maketh intercession for us
[50:20] the Bible says who shall separate us
[50:22] from the love of Christ shall
[50:23] tribulation or distress or persecution
[50:26] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[50:32] and it goes on down to say nay and all
[50:35] these things we are more than conquerors
[50:36] to him that loved us
[50:40] and verse 39 says nor height nor depth
[50:43] nor any creature shall be able to
[50:44] separate us from the love of God which
[50:46] is in Christ Jesus you know that love
[50:49] you know the Lord brooding over your
[50:51] life it's um
[50:53] can we there's a quote that might be the
[50:56] next one can we just put that on
[50:59] yeah is that one
[51:02] um brother Ramsay is here and he's doing
[51:04] it today he has made a preparation to
[51:06] conserve his own purpose
[51:09] no sorry that's not
[51:13] I was read it up there oh my that's
[51:15] trying to exhaust God's goodness and
[51:17] mercy to his people he wants to bless
[51:19] you he's ready he's pressing could you
[51:22] imagine taking all the waters in the
[51:24] Earth the seeds and everything and
[51:26] piling it into one four foot pipe and
[51:28] put it up there
[51:29] the pressure that would be on the bottom
[51:31] of it trying to find a little crevice to
[51:33] leak its way through that's like the
[51:35] pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to
[51:37] come down on every life amen
[51:40] I mean and we just it's like um by the
[51:43] Andy preached on Wednesday you know we
[51:45] it's what are you willing to surrender
[51:47] what are you willing to give up and um
[51:50] and you know there might be certain
[51:52] things in our lives that's holding that
[51:53] back I believe in the end that will win
[51:55] through but
[51:58] but it's if we if we just give ourselves
[52:01] to him I'm sure that will you know that
[52:03] will have effect a lot quicker
[52:05] amen
[52:07] foreign
[52:16] God did not make you and I just to see
[52:19] if he could do it he made us for a
[52:21] purpose therefore there is a purpose of
[52:23] all of us being here you're not here
[52:26] just to be another human being you were
[52:28] here because God made you for some
[52:30] purpose you're not here just to eat the
[52:32] food that God growed you're not here
[52:34] just to live in the house that man made
[52:36] or to wear the clothing that someone
[52:37] fashioned you're here for a specific
[52:40] purpose
[52:41] no matter how little you are how big you
[52:43] are how important you are or how
[52:45] unimportant you are you are here to
[52:47] serve a purpose
[52:48] just as my finger is here for a purpose
[52:50] my nail on my fingers for a purpose
[52:54] my eye and every part of our bodies is
[52:56] to serve a purpose
[52:58] and it was not put here just to see what
[53:00] it would look like when it was put here
[53:02] but it was put here to serve its purpose
[53:04] it was God's divine plan to do so
[53:07] and you know
[53:09] sometimes it's hard knowing what is
[53:10] God's purpose
[53:12] um we're not all called to make a move
[53:13] in it's all very clear but
[53:16] I believe if we're sincere we ask the
[53:19] Lord he'll show it yes
[53:23] and if we're here for a purpose then
[53:24] there is nothing that can destroy us and
[53:26] God until God's purpose is fulfilled
[53:28] nothing can harm us until that purpose
[53:30] that God has put us here for has been
[53:32] made manifest no matter how much trouble
[53:34] we have how much heartaches or Sorrows
[53:36] that we go through all of those are
[53:38] reasons and there's a reason for it
[53:41] we will take for instance Noah in the
[53:43] Bible
[53:53] yeah I'll I'll skip that yeah yeah amen
[54:01] and you know
[54:03] one thing that I always think about is
[54:05] defeat is not an option giving up is not
[54:08] an option as a Christian you don't you
[54:09] don't actually have that option
[54:11] um if if you gave up because things are
[54:14] hard and difficult uh you'll probably
[54:16] end up in a worse spot than the hard and
[54:18] difficult you're experiencing but
[54:20] um I'm so thankful like we cannot lose
[54:23] um you know as Sons and Daughters of God
[54:25] we we cannot lose and
[54:28] yeah it's like David said you know the
[54:31] pardon it's you know all everything that
[54:33] we need is contained in the pardon and
[54:36] it's not just a pardon for sins it's not
[54:39] just a pardon for it doesn't just give
[54:41] you eternal life it's also a button that
[54:43] gives you Victory it gives you Joy and
[54:47] and and I believe we can access all
[54:49] those and um
[54:53] yeah may the Lord help us
[54:58] and
[55:00] you know you know back to that Earth
[55:02] that analogy of the earth that's without
[55:04] form and void like you might be bound by
[55:07] complexes and even unbelief like just a
[55:11] bit of a testimony in my own life like
[55:13] there was a point where
[55:15] I was basically wallowing an unbelief
[55:18] and I didn't know how to get myself out
[55:19] of it and um and the Lord just worked
[55:23] things in such a way that it completely
[55:24] changed the whole thing
[55:26] and and you know of course the devil
[55:28] will always try and still attack with
[55:30] unbelief it's his job but um
[55:33] but yeah I mean the Lord the Lord can
[55:36] change that so you might
[55:38] you might not even you know some people
[55:40] might not even want to serve him praise
[55:42] the Lord for the young fellows that got
[55:44] baptized today that's awesome that's um
[55:47] as you're turning from being void into
[55:50] that
[55:52] and um so thankful for that
[55:57] and you know
[55:59] but if you find yourself in a place like
[56:01] that where you maybe don't want to serve
[56:04] them or you don't know if if this is all
[56:06] true
[56:07] ask the Lord ask him Lord if this is
[56:10] true show me amen and I and I know he
[56:12] will and um and you know we can't change
[56:15] our hearts but we can ask God lord
[56:17] change my heart if there's something in
[56:19] there
[56:19] that shouldn't be that way if I think a
[56:22] certain way of act a certain way Lord
[56:24] you can change me
[56:25] and um and you know one thing I also
[56:29] struggled with quite a lot and some I'm
[56:30] still battler today is just spending
[56:33] time in the wood and praying you know
[56:35] um and I always used to pray Lord
[56:39] um give me a desire
[56:41] for your word and you know with that
[56:43] desire it's so much easier to do it and
[56:46] and then
[56:48] yeah
[56:49] and one thing I um
[56:52] I I thought about a lot was um you know
[56:55] what you do today has effects tomorrow
[56:58] yes so if you spend time with a word
[57:01] today and you pray
[57:03] down the track it'll benefit you
[57:06] the same way if you feed on not
[57:08] necessary stuff that's wrong but just
[57:10] constantly out of the atmosphere of God
[57:13] um down the track
[57:15] is that that those results in your life
[57:17] but if you if you spend that time you
[57:20] say Lord give me a desire I will produce
[57:22] fruits down down the track in your life
[57:29] yeah so um that's basically it's
[57:31] basically what I have here and um yeah
[57:33] Lord Jesus may may he just in his own
[57:36] way continue to change us from that that
[57:39] first picture which was can you put up
[57:40] that picture of the icy ball and then
[57:43] the next one with the waters
[57:46] you know may the that's probably
[57:48] something what it looked like I don't
[57:50] know but that's maybe a good picture of
[57:52] what it looked like there's nothing
[57:53] there's no life there and um the spirit
[57:56] of God moved upon those Waters and he's
[57:59] moving upon your and my life and
[58:03] um yeah if you haven't given your heart
[58:05] to the Lord yet
[58:06] maybe he's calling you to give
[58:09] um your heart to the Lord and if you
[58:11] have you know we constantly grow like
[58:13] there's maybe sort of still some
[58:15] portions of your creation that's got to
[58:17] come forth and Lord may I come forth we
[58:20] are willing we'll be you know we we
[58:23] surrender
[58:24] um we give ourselves Lord
[58:27] um can we just uh Ed you put a one of
[58:31] the verses that you put up before
[58:32] the service it's not the one with the
[58:34] picture of the Earth but the other one
[58:38] yeah I hope our help is in the name of
[58:40] the Lord who made Heaven and Earth and I
[58:42] think it was this morning
[58:44] um it was a verse that said you know the
[58:46] Earth is the Lord's so our Earth is the
[58:49] Lord's it's not it's not really your
[58:51] Earth you know
[58:52] um that's right it is the Lord's and if
[58:55] it's his it's you know he's going to
[58:58] work on you and you're gonna you're
[58:59] gonna move from
[59:00] avoid condition to an earth so
[59:03] yeah very simple very basic um Justin
