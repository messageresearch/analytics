[2:27] that okay
[2:28] okay good I just want to make sure it's
[2:30] um I don't want to take you through a
[2:31] song session and you can't really hear
[2:32] very well so that's good praise the Lord
[2:40] there's a high chance we might be
[2:42] meeting this Sunday and building which
[2:47] will be everyone hears clapping yeah so
[2:52] we can sort of we won't have to go
[2:54] through all this but yeah this has been
[2:57] a very interesting time for the for the
[2:59] world to go through and yeah the
[3:05] some big changes coming up for the globe
[3:08] in the in the next short while I think
[3:10] you'll find it's it's fascinating times
[3:13] even this event this happened as as it's
[3:16] changed how things are going to happen
[3:18] even though it's essentially a small
[3:20] thing that's happened but the way that
[3:22] it's gone about don't know don't
[3:25] understand if he no one's doing things
[3:27] or what's happening but the end result
[3:29] was going to be catastrophic I think for
[3:31] the way the world operates and and it's
[3:38] yeah it's it's going to be like in a
[3:43] natural sense it's going to be really
[3:44] quite bad for the world and is there's
[3:46] going to be big changes coming and it's
[3:49] gonna be a very chaotic time I think
[3:53] you'll find in the next months and years
[3:57] things are not things are going to go
[3:59] different very different from here like
[4:00] the the the global economy is basically
[4:02] going it will crash it's going to
[4:04] collapse and crash the system we have at
[4:06] the moment is going to crash it can't
[4:08] sustain itself the debt can't be
[4:10] serviced then is there's going to be
[4:12] there will be big changes as a result of
[4:14] that and yeah that's something people's
[4:18] life savings that they worked so hard
[4:20] for they will eventually if they've got
[4:23] them held in cash they will disappear
[4:24] like people have gone out sweeted in
[4:27] worked hard and must been away from
[4:29] their families and that value they got
[4:31] from their will be gone if it's held in
[4:33] cash because there'll be hyper inflation
[4:34] which cash won't be worth anything
[4:36] certain currencies won't be worth
[4:38] anything around the globe and it will be
[4:40] it'll be a very sad time in a very hard
[4:42] time but you know we are we're on the
[4:46] right track because we've got the Lord
[4:48] you know and that's that's um that's
[4:52] humanity's only hope as the Lord because
[4:55] there's a we're on a path to destruction
[4:57] unfortunately in this world but let's um

[42:30] today about how you know brother Aaron
[42:32] would would speak about blind Bartimaeus
[42:34] and and he would say it was his mother
[42:36] that told him all the great stories of
[42:38] the heroes of faith like Joshua and
[42:41] Elijah and the different ones that they
[42:43] will walk through Jericho and it was
[42:45] those stories that she would tell her as
[42:48] she would tell him as she would pick him
[42:51] up on his I'm on her lap as as here's a
[42:53] little boy and those things anchored
[42:56] into his heart and then when finally the
[42:57] God of hosts prophets and you know you
[42:59] know was walking through the gates of
[43:01] Jericho that morning I mean because of
[43:04] what his mother told him I mean he
[43:07] recognized that that the god of Elijah
[43:09] the God of Joshua was now walking amen
[43:12] through the through the gates of Jericho
[43:14] and he called
[43:15] we've got what he needed at that time so

[44:11] so I'm but but we'll get that
[44:13] information out to you before Sunday run
[44:16] arm you so but without planning and
[44:17] we're excited I mean to be back in
[44:19] church to get a man that finally this
[44:23] this this lockdown is well coming to an
[44:25] end for us anyway and yes I god bless
[44:28] you all and yes let's go to Genesis 15
[44:31] and we're gonna read from verse 4 I'm
[44:35] just gotta find I mean so Genesis 15 and
[44:41] 4 and if you're there you can you can
[44:45] say say Amen so Genesis 15 you for and
[44:53] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[44:57] him saying this shall not be thine ear
[45:01] but he that shall come forth out of our
[45:04] own bowels shall be thine ear and he
[45:07] brought him and he brought him forth
[45:09] abroad and said look now towards heaven
[45:12] and tell the Stars if thou be able to
[45:15] number them and he said unto him so so
[45:19] shall thy seed be and he believed in the
[45:22] Lord and it counted to him
[45:24] for righteousness now we're going to go
[45:27] to Romans chapter 4 I just want to take
[45:29] you very well
[45:32] you know just as you're turning I want
[45:33] to continue talking about faith being
[45:36] being our righteousness and I just want
[45:39] to you just want to continue on this
[45:41] thought here but we just so say I mean
[45:43] when you're in Romans chapter 4 amen
[45:46] amen I got navy for my lounge for one
[45:57] what shall we say then that Abraham out
[46:00] then that out that Abraham I Father as
[46:03] pertaining to the flesh hath found for
[46:05] if Abraham were justified by works he
[46:07] hath wrought to glory but not before God
[46:10] Ford said the scripture but abraham
[46:13] believed God and was accounted unto him
[46:15] for righteousness
[46:15] now to him that worketh is the reward
[46:18] not reckoned of grace but of debt but
[46:20] him that worketh not but believeth on
[46:22] him that justifieth the ungodly his
[46:24] faith is counted for righteousness even
[46:27] as david also describeth the blessedness
[46:29] of the man unto whom God imputed
[46:32] righteousness without works now we keep
[46:34] reading down first down down to verse 13
[46:37] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[46:39] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[46:41] amen
[46:42] listen as the man to whom the Lord will
[46:44] not impute sin cometh this blessedness
[46:47] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[46:51] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[46:54] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[46:56] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[46:58] when he was in circumcision or
[47:00] uncircumcision and circumcision but in
[47:03] uncircumcision and he received the sign
[47:06] of circumcision a seal of the
[47:08] righteousness of the faith which he had
[47:10] been circumcised that he might be the
[47:13] father of all them that belief though
[47:15] they be not circumcised that
[47:17] righteousness might be imputed under
[47:19] them also and and the father of
[47:22] circumcision to them who are not of the
[47:25] circumcision only but who also walk in
[47:28] the steps of that faith of our father
[47:30] Abraham which he had being yet
[47:33] uncircumcised for the promise that he
[47:35] should be the heir of the world
[47:37] not to Abraham or to a seat through the
[47:39] law but through the righteousness of
[47:42] faith malicious belfry this morning the
[47:47] Lord Jesus we're so thankful we can get
[47:49] a lord in your presence Lord we have
[47:51] sang the songs of Zion Lord Lord even
[47:53] now our hearts are filled with joy and
[47:56] Thanksgiving this is what you've done
[47:58] for us Lord and how you're walking with
[48:00] us in this hour and I just pray our Lord
[48:02] may just take this little thought Lord
[48:04] may you may be multiplied to Gourmet tag
[48:06] these take the Lord like you took the
[48:08] loaves and the fish is physically Lord
[48:10] and feed the multitude or may
[48:11] spiritually take the loaves and the
[48:13] fishes your word and by the grade of
[48:15] heaven and multiply it Lord that Lord we
[48:17] would go out of this meeting full and
[48:19] satisfied and rejoicing but this may you
[48:21] grounded their God I just want to commit
[48:23] the service unto your hands Lord may
[48:26] take three months in every life Lord
[48:27] have your way in our hearts O God
[48:29] and may we leave this meeting change
[48:31] Lord Jesus our renewed father we just
[48:33] want to pray for those who a second body

[48:39] your stripes you've already healed them
[48:40] Lord and father all those who are
[48:42] afflicted by this virus around the world

[49:18] hour as well father maybe be a mighty
[49:20] reliable Lord maybe be a great awakening
[49:22] of your children in this time father in
[49:24] Jesus Christ and granted Lord amen
[49:26] I mean god bless you friends you may
[49:28] have your seats this morning so I like
[49:30] to I speak about faith the path of faith
[49:36] you know I just want to continue in this
[49:37] thought so we read here that abraham
[49:40] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[49:43] to him for righteousness now this is the
[49:46] in the scripture that that there is
[49:48] actually a link between someone's
[49:50] righteousness and their faith it was um
[49:52] you know when you read about Noah you
[49:55] know I said that Noah found grace in the
[49:57] side of the law and so that was you know
[50:00] and he was he was considered righteous
[50:03] but you know it was Abraham was the
[50:05] first one that was ever God linked faith
[50:08] and righteousness together and said
[50:11] because he believed God he was righteous
[50:13] amen and when he is the father of the
[50:16] faith they meant in that and that it's
[50:17] not only this is not only attributed to
[50:20] him I mean bless attributed to us as we
[50:22] just read so Evans is now God receives
[50:25] our faith when he gives us the Holy
[50:27] Ghost I mean just just as abraham
[50:30] believed God and God gave him a a sign
[50:34] that that that his faith was accepted
[50:36] and that sign was that he was
[50:38] circumcised right but faith he received
[50:41] that faith before he received the
[50:42] circumcision and that faith made him
[50:45] righteous but the circumcision was just
[50:47] a sign from come to him that God had
[50:50] received his faith now it's the same
[50:51] thing with us I meant the faith that we
[50:53] have received and we believe on the Lord
[50:55] Jesus Christ and then God receives that
[50:59] faith and and the sign that he has
[51:00] received that faith as he gives us the
[51:02] Holy Ghost I mean so now we have an
[51:04] assurance now the believer has the
[51:06] assurance I mean that their faith works
[51:11] or maybe it's just me but there are many
[51:14] times we think do we have the faith I
[51:16] need to actually ever ahim to get a hold
[51:20] of the promise for the hour right I mean
[51:23] this is this is always a challenge the
[51:24] devil says alright you don't really
[51:25] believe you don't have enough right but
[51:27] I want to tell you this morning I mean
[51:29] if God has given you the Holy Ghost I
[51:31] mean then God has received your faith I
[51:34] mean that you now have the faith I need
[51:37] to produce the promise they are which is
[51:39] the body change faith amen Abraham's
[51:46] faith produced you know caused him
[51:48] eventually to receive the promise up
[51:50] right sorry but like some thing is now
[51:53] his faith way to work I meant
[51:56] and then he lived his faith love
[51:58] and he received a promise of his a lacy
[52:02] Abraham's promise Mima the word for the
[52:04] ally if we want to put it in kind of
[52:06] mrs. Lindo message of the Ellen
[52:09] Abraham's day as he would receive the
[52:11] promised son was the message of the
[52:14] Alpha warning is out all right so now so
[52:17] so God gave him the sign of circumcision
[52:20] God had received his faith that the
[52:23] message of the young would be manifested
[52:25] in his life in other words he was going
[52:28] to receive the promised son as even with
[52:31] me because you know many times we look
[52:34] oh I just had the faith you know because
[52:36] we're Abraham's you know seed you know
[52:38] way according to faith where Abraham's
[52:41] children and as the father's afraid he
[52:43] believed God it was a putative
[52:44] righteousness and you know and then and
[52:46] then and then we think well how does
[52:48] this work in our life grow the faith of
[52:51] Abraham had and going to see their faith
[52:53] that gave him the sermon God accepted it
[52:55] I mean then then gave him the promised
[52:58] son did now we believe God and God and
[53:01] the proof we believe God as he fills us
[53:03] with His Holy spirt right and that is
[53:05] the evidence that is the proof I mean
[53:07] that that the message of the L will be
[53:10] manifested in your life I mean we
[53:13] provide the body changed ultimately the
[53:15] promise right that's ultimately diplomas
[53:17] from the age and infestations that we're
[53:19] living in is in the living Church I mean
[53:21] that will be translated the class for
[53:23] Christ first right change these mortal
[53:26] bodies a man and God is going to take us
[53:29] with them and in fact next to mention
[53:31] and we'll be not because God has taken
[53:32] us that's important H right so now Jojo
[53:36] do we have a face for a rapture and also
[53:40] a bride does have to fight into the word
[53:45] that we have received right it's all
[53:48] tied into the word that we received now
[53:49] Abraham do not receive he didn't
[53:52] received the same instance we have Rock
[53:55] him a god down through the ages gives us
[53:58] certain misses programs isn't really
[54:00] simply what good would it be as Moses
[54:02] came into Egypt preaching Noah's message
[54:04] and wouldn't work now as Noah's the word
[54:08] for Noah's day though
[54:09] still true today that was just as Jordan
[54:11] and Moses day but it didn't apply the
[54:15] same way to Moses as it did to Noah
[54:18] because no the build the I maybe he
[54:21] thought God moved on his hand he found
[54:23] grace in the sight of God and the
[54:25] message in the ad then was to build the
[54:27] ark and get in right and everyone that
[54:30] really took God in His Word really
[54:32] believed what God was saying stepped
[54:34] into the akima sight but then Moses
[54:38] couldn't have gone down into Egypt I'm
[54:40] gonna let my people go you know they
[54:44] just wouldn't work because that message
[54:46] couldn't have worked in that day because
[54:47] that was know as message right
[54:49] same thing when John the Baptist came he
[54:53] he wouldn't have done no good if he
[54:56] preached Moses's message for the law is
[54:58] still true though what Moses said was
[55:00] true but but but I've John the Baptist I
[55:03] mean could not have stood there and
[55:04] preached what Moses preached cousin was
[55:07] now a different season and then you go
[55:10] through Jesus Jesus what would it be if
[55:12] Jesus preached knows message or mother's
[55:15] message or even John the Baptist message
[55:17] I thought they were all sure but God had
[55:19] moved on those ones that police I mean
[55:26] that they received that word is not a
[55:28] mental workout but something in their
[55:30] heart says yes speaking yes I believe
[55:33] that I mean then God takes their faith
[55:36] and attributes it to them for
[55:37] righteousness
[55:39] amen the promise of the hour and they
[55:45] day no I'm just gonna maybe you know
[55:49] it's like you drive somewhere sometimes
[55:51] you drive far sometimes you drive slow
[55:53] you know this 50 kaiser 30k so these may
[55:56] be 100k sir we may be in the 30k zone
[55:58] but we're going to give him a faster
[55:59] reach leave I just wanna emphasize this
[56:01] a little bit you know you know you take
[56:04] you take Joshua and Caleb they received
[56:08] the word for the day they received the
[56:10] message of the hour okay
[56:12] and because they believed that they were
[56:15] counted righteous and it manifested
[56:17] members of faith they had in that word
[56:19] that they
[56:20] see took them into their inheritance I'm
[56:23] it's a Joshua and Caleb were were there
[56:25] there were slaves but then they but then
[56:28] Moses came into Egypt and they recognize
[56:30] this was more than a man during this
[56:32] this was God during this call in his
[56:35] word and they followed an old way to
[56:36] Mount Sinai
[56:37] and they received that law and they and
[56:40] they recognized that God had come not
[56:43] just to give them a ceremony or models
[56:47] of church order well this is how you
[56:49] should trace it this is what you should
[56:50] do I'm in the message the house which I
[56:56] was this week after brother John Andes
[56:59] preached on on Tuesday you know I bow
[57:02] down with saying that message many times
[57:03] we tell the people what they shouldn't
[57:05] do I mean bility to tell me what they
[57:08] you know like we should do Rob I should
[57:10] stop drinking and smoking and you know
[57:12] lying and cheating you know this is many
[57:15] times what people tell people they
[57:16] should stop doing but we should but he
[57:19] sees in that message we need to tell the
[57:20] people what they should do and and they
[57:24] should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:26] because it's a power in faith
[57:30] Joshua and Caleb they received the
[57:33] message of the hour and I'm just yeah
[57:35] I'm going to use our language they
[57:37] received the word for the day slavery
[57:44] three sons sons of God but they were in
[57:47] slavery and took them away from slavery
[57:49] Egypt into their inheritance to the
[57:51] promised land so they manifested and
[57:54] there are lies the message of the day
[58:00] when Caleb was responding his 84 years
[58:03] old he took his mountain he could
[58:05] finally look back and say everything
[58:07] Moses preached our beneficent Scripture
[58:14] and it's completeness on all the way
[58:22] down from his journey he could look back
[58:24] inside everything Moses preached I'm now
[58:27] living it up hallelujah and saw one you
[58:32] know brother Brad would say in my house
[58:33] I've just got this here he says now
[58:35] let's take for instance all of us we'd
[58:37] say we one slide and we'd still with
[58:39] curse and swear and do everything that's
[58:41] wrong
[58:42] well one day when we accepted Christ
[58:44] what did he do he opened up as soon as
[58:47] we accepted a better faith just like
[58:49] Paul told the relevant of book to have
[58:52] belief just exactly what drug did
[58:55] believe see and as soon as we accepted
[58:58] Christ I'll save you
[58:59] immediately we received in our faith
[59:01] till you walked away normal lying normal
[59:04] stealing no more cheating see why we
[59:07] wrote right up above that sins that we
[59:11] used to ride in there we was a lot of
[59:13] that much faith why because we believe
[59:16] that we are saved is that right we
[59:18] believe here that we are safe so that we
[59:20] run up above that because we believe we
[59:24] are saved and then you'd say I believe
[59:27] is in the same message I was telling my
[59:28] wife the other day how much I loved her
[59:30] so I so I don't guess she wants me to
[59:33] talk about this but but if I do it in
[59:36] private so I guess I can do it in the
[59:37] public right now I was telling you how
[59:39] much I loved her and how I always have
[59:42] loved her since the first beginning I
[59:44] said I see that don't make any
[59:46] difference you see no bill she said
[59:47] talking about how fat she was getting it
[59:50] and here was turning grey I said honey
[59:52] you could be as wide and not here I
[59:55] still love you just the same
[59:57] see because it has to be something there
[1:00:00] that you have to meet that you love
[1:00:02] somebody and at least that person loves
[1:00:04] that other person he says this is for
[1:00:07] you young girls it's not marriage in you
[1:00:09] boys when you meet that girl that you
[1:00:11] love and there's just something you know
[1:00:13] you love her and that's just all there
[1:00:16] is to it or you love him and you don't
[1:00:19] care where these handsome ready
[1:00:20] handsome really she's pretty enough
[1:00:22] pretty that doesn't matter but you love
[1:00:25] them just the same now you'd better
[1:00:27] watch kind of hold around close there
[1:00:29] because you're getting close to home in
[1:00:32] so it's basically saying you basically
[1:00:34] found the one that looks lead you across
[1:00:36] to get married to me alright you know
[1:00:38] yes so it's not based on outward
[1:00:39] appearance at all yes she's beautiful I
[1:00:41] love her she does they're here or how he
[1:00:43] is or whatever no there's something in
[1:00:44] them you just love them oh and a
[1:00:48] marriage based outside of that is sure
[1:00:51] to fall or it'll never be successful and
[1:00:54] literally happy now I said that to get
[1:00:56] around to one thing I want to say is his
[1:00:59] friends are converging outside of the
[1:01:01] same thing won't last either at won't
[1:01:04] when you go to church you say well I'm
[1:01:06] going to join church I'm going to be
[1:01:07] yeah I'm going to be baptized if it
[1:01:09] isn't coming from a high of life to God
[1:01:12] yonder it'll never go nowhere you'll
[1:01:15] just all you'll do is join church and be
[1:01:17] baptized but when you're converted to
[1:01:18] Christ I love to Christ then you
[1:01:21] accumulate a faith in Christ who knows
[1:01:23] what accumulate means it means it means
[1:01:26] you get more and more and more Rock you
[1:01:28] know I'm in a faith in Christ like you
[1:01:31] would take your wife to your husband you
[1:01:33] accumulate a faith that you walk in that
[1:01:35] faith I don't know I just
[1:01:37] there's something about you just
[1:01:38] something that anchors you there you see
[1:01:41] well this the same way it is about
[1:01:43] Christ and what Christ says you believe
[1:01:45] it and you just stay right with it
[1:01:47] that's the way it just raises you right
[1:01:49] up above it and God brings it to pass
[1:01:51] and fulfills his promise if they will
[1:01:54] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I and
[1:01:56] my house shall be saved those are just
[1:02:00] walking member a real conversion is
[1:02:02] embraced you know and I think I see this
[1:02:05] a few weeks ago but a real conversion is
[1:02:07] not based on circumstances it's not
[1:02:11] based on circumstances it's based on who
[1:02:14] he is and what he has done right I mean
[1:02:17] is our salvation that down Calvary I
[1:02:20] mean we're free people hallelujah he's
[1:02:22] bought us a mighty long way through the
[1:02:24] world
[1:02:25] that was coming to a leg and he's given
[1:02:27] us a faith to present every promise
[1:02:29] remember win-win-win faith lands in the
[1:02:32] heart I mean he God has received that
[1:02:34] faith that every promise in the book now
[1:02:36] belongs to that person see see see many
[1:02:39] times what to do I have enough faith for
[1:02:41] a body changing for Haley where do baby
[1:02:42] yes we have I mean if he has received on
[1:02:47] faith hallelujah I mean did we have the
[1:02:50] faith that we need just gets greater and
[1:02:56] greater and accumulates now I just want
[1:03:04] to go to Romans teen here he sees here
[1:03:05] for the scripture saith whosoever
[1:03:07] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:03:10] there's no difference between the Jew
[1:03:13] and the Greek for the same lord over all
[1:03:16] is rich unto all that call upon him for
[1:03:18] whosoever shall call upon the name Lord
[1:03:20] shall be saved
[1:03:21] now then shall they call on him in whom
[1:03:23] they have not believed and how shall
[1:03:26] they believe and how shall they preach
[1:03:29] except they be seen as is written how
[1:03:31] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:03:32] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:03:34] glad tidings of good I mean glad tidings
[1:03:36] of good things but they have not all
[1:03:38] obeyed the gospel flys is at Lord who
[1:03:41] has believed our report so faith cometh
[1:03:44] by hearing and hearing by the Word of
[1:03:46] God now this is how faith comes right
[1:03:50] faith cometh by hearing the word of God
[1:03:53] right faith cometh by hearing and
[1:03:55] hearing by the word so if the word is
[1:03:58] preached then you receive hearing you
[1:04:01] receive faith but just like am I saying
[1:04:04] you know I'm gonna travel and meet you
[1:04:07] and I go there by my account so much to
[1:04:10] you right I have traveled by my car to
[1:04:13] you and is the same thing we says that
[1:04:15] faith cometh by hearing I'm in your face
[1:04:18] comes to you by hearing and hearing by
[1:04:22] the word so if the word has now preached
[1:04:24] I meant
[1:04:25] the advices are saved right you received
[1:04:28] hearing that you can hear the word and
[1:04:30] you can verse a fight I mean but the
[1:04:32] thing is now that that what what we must
[1:04:36] recognize is we will only
[1:04:38] as high as the word is preached I meant
[1:04:42] so for example I mean if the message was
[1:04:47] just a message of justification only do
[1:04:50] this is Hardware look right would be in
[1:04:52] and out up and down you know with the
[1:04:54] you know things would bother us you know
[1:04:56] yeah they'd still be sitting holding us
[1:04:58] down and you know that because that's as
[1:05:00] high as we could live but you would be
[1:05:02] justified the side of God and now if the
[1:05:04] message was only a message of
[1:05:05] justification and sanctification then we
[1:05:08] would only live a holy life right they
[1:05:11] wouldn't be a manifestation of the Holy
[1:05:13] Ghost following me I mean they would be
[1:05:17] healings and miracles and signs and
[1:05:19] wonders that far as we could live and
[1:05:22] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:05:23] hearing the Word of God and then now if
[1:05:25] we as the message was our you know but
[1:05:28] but we know the message is more than
[1:05:30] that this message is a message of full
[1:05:33] adoption right okay Marvin Amen see see
[1:05:37] if this is sealed if this is sealed did
[1:05:40] how can the would be preached out of it
[1:05:42] and that give us a rapturing faith I
[1:05:44] meant Moses now the book came open
[1:05:48] emerges day I mean that yeah you're the
[1:05:51] Lord part of it came down into his hand
[1:05:53] you could say and he preached the
[1:05:55] contents of the book to them and they
[1:05:57] needed to receive that open book on
[1:05:59] Mount Sinai and face it we're going to
[1:06:01] take the land now and they're winning
[1:06:03] took the land from the hearing of the
[1:06:07] word merits this is why God brought us
[1:06:10] out I wasn't used to give us a bunch of
[1:06:12] jet rolls
[1:06:13] I mean I was actually that we would grow
[1:06:15] as an adopted body I mean the promised
[1:06:18] land
[1:06:18] everyone will be a near here that's
[1:06:20] right and is the same thing today I mean
[1:06:23] the book is come Harper oh yeah we
[1:06:25] believe it darling we believe
[1:06:27] revelations Tina's be manifested angels
[1:06:30] come down with an open book how they're
[1:06:33] seven thunders hammer out of their
[1:06:35] voices it's very simple because program
[1:06:37] says that you know what's a thunder as
[1:06:39] the voice of God not interpreted and
[1:06:41] then when Jesus glorify thy name there's
[1:06:45] a one spark from heaven said I've
[1:06:47] glorified
[1:08:27] just say just say this but you know this
[1:08:30] is not just a if this was just
[1:08:33] Abraham's inheritance but he believes it
[1:08:36] any manifested right the tech maybe cam
[1:08:40] and duster they had a bit more right and
[1:08:42] they man cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:08:45] the Word of God so they receive the
[1:08:47] message for the day and in their lives
[1:08:49] manifest
[1:08:53] then you can take King David when he was
[1:08:59] anointed king I mean if something
[1:09:49] anchors in your heart then you can just
[1:09:51] continue to walk on no matter what you
[1:09:52] see with your eyes what do you see you
[1:09:56] know even what you see with your eyes
[1:09:58] maybe you feel the sickness in your body
[1:10:01] I mean you can walk with God
[1:10:03] irrespective of those things this just
[1:10:06] comes to mind so I want to scroll down
[1:10:08] let me show you because what happens now
[1:10:11] is the promise of God is always present
[1:10:14] run what happens is the devil tries to
[1:10:17] block the promise that see the promise
[1:10:20] of God but we see you can say our
[1:10:22] circumstances shown you know this three
[1:10:28] deer right this three deer in this
[1:10:31] forest now if we if we are just looking
[1:10:36] casually what happens is sometimes we
[1:10:38] are looking for something I played
[1:10:42] cricket and and and and lost the tennis
[1:10:44] ball in the bush somewhere yep now if
[1:10:48] your sometimes you've actually put a
[1:10:50] look past all the Leafs and then you can
[1:10:53] see the tennis ball right but if your
[1:10:55] vision is actually just caught up in the
[1:10:57] bushes you'll never see it but yeah it's
[1:10:59] right there I mean you got to look
[1:11:03] those leaves and look through and look
[1:11:05] for the tennis ball it's the same thing
[1:11:07] with the devil the promise of God is
[1:11:09] there but he tries to put things in its
[1:11:11] way right then all we can sometimes see
[1:11:14] is just what the devil's put in front of
[1:11:16] it and not the promise but if you look
[1:11:18] past the circumstances if you look past
[1:11:21] your sickness if you look past your
[1:11:23] financial worries and posture you're
[1:11:25] maybe trouble in the family or even
[1:11:28] trouble in your own body troubling your
[1:11:31] spurt if you look past those things then
[1:11:35] you can actually see I mean the promise
[1:11:39] of God some will be looking for the deer
[1:11:43] so just do this this is where they have
[1:11:45] a mean now some of us now and in circles
[1:11:51] of mysamma I just found the photos of it
[1:11:54] but you know some of us that have found
[1:11:58] those a lot quicker than others because
[1:12:01] some of us are used to chasing our four
[1:12:06] who friends through the fires trying to
[1:12:08] kill them right so that some of us they
[1:12:13] used to walk in that kind of environment
[1:12:14] right looking for deer to shoot so they
[1:12:18] they they they have become trained to
[1:12:21] look for deer hiding behind rocks and
[1:12:23] trees the bushes whatever more some of
[1:12:25] us are not but it's the same thing with
[1:12:28] the Word of God and then we have to make
[1:12:31] the lord help us to actually as we walk
[1:12:34] in the word then we can look beyond
[1:12:37] circumstance and trouble I mean whatever
[1:12:40] it may mean we can look beyond those
[1:12:41] things
[1:12:42] and look for the promise because if we
[1:12:44] can see the promise I mean then we will
[1:12:46] press into that promise right but if we
[1:12:48] see what the OtterBox right scarecrows
[1:12:51] and worrying for travel and sickness and
[1:12:55] pain and sorrow and and uncertainty all
[1:12:58] those findings
[1:12:59] and we just look at those things we'll
[1:13:01] never see the premise because our focus
[1:13:02] is not on the promise anymore it's on
[1:13:05] the trouble
[1:13:06] Amen so Lord Jesus maybe just look for
[1:13:09] the promise member member when okay
[1:13:12] Sarah was looking so so just imagine
[1:13:16] that as these are the promise you have a
[1:13:17] promise um you'll be the father of many
[1:13:20] nations okay just just amazing those
[1:13:22] deals like that now Sarah speed
[1:13:25] twenty-five years or twenty forty years
[1:13:27] looking at it like this but but we're
[1:13:31] out past childbearing age I've already
[1:13:33] gone through menopause we couldn't even
[1:13:35] have children when we were young with
[1:13:37] well pasta agents what was she doing
[1:13:40] looking at the trees and not seeing the
[1:13:44] deer not seeing the puppies but Abraham
[1:13:47] because God revealed at them he could
[1:13:50] see the promise promise and he was
[1:13:54] strong giving glory to God I mean
[1:13:57] because he had faith that God was more
[1:13:59] than able fulfill his word in his life
[1:14:02] because remember God had done had give
[1:14:06] him the cavalry of circumcision right
[1:14:08] that he would manifest the promise first
[1:14:11] day you'd receive the promise of Aliyah
[1:14:14] so now he had confidence that his faith
[1:14:16] work and God was going to deliver what
[1:14:18] he promised he would do I meant
[1:14:21] so now so now Abraham wasn't looking I
[1:14:24] mean he wasn't looking at the at the
[1:14:26] circumcised he staggered not at the
[1:14:27] promise of God pulled the ride Romans
[1:14:29] for I mean no his body did and all these
[1:14:32] things but but he was strong getting
[1:14:34] pricey God that he was more than able to
[1:14:36] perform that which he had promised to do
[1:14:39] but sit on the other hand was just
[1:14:41] singing like this she couldn't see it
[1:14:43] until Genesis 18 I mean when the Lord
[1:14:48] came down I mean to to to manifest
[1:14:51] himself I mean and when he began to
[1:14:54] speak about it coins a time of life you
[1:14:56] shall have the promised son I mean
[1:14:58] member that visitation was actually
[1:15:00] series visitation
[1:15:02] there was neighbor hence was
[1:15:03] should I for him already believe the
[1:15:04] promise I'll label you know room with
[1:15:07] dramatizing a bit you know is hot on
[1:15:09] that yeah I got you on the plains of
[1:15:11] Mamre there wasn't much you know for the
[1:15:12] cattle to eat it wasn't the wild ordered
[1:15:14] planes by Solomon you know and he and he
[1:15:17] said serum got a bit you know a bit
[1:15:19] fussy that caught a day and it was
[1:15:21] actually the devil trying to block the
[1:15:23] visitation of God himself but Abraham
[1:15:25] kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:15:27] oh yeah and then we come Ben finally
[1:15:30] finally hallelujah I mean I mean the
[1:15:33] visitation happened and serious heart
[1:15:36] was changed I mean from from just seeing
[1:15:38] the wood yeah you're just seeing the
[1:15:40] trees then finally she saw the promise
[1:15:43] because the God who gave the promise now
[1:15:46] came down to confirm the promise with
[1:15:48] her Aliyah and then as pulled of right
[1:15:53] about her divine commentary in Hebrews
[1:15:55] chapter 11 he said that she judged him
[1:15:58] faithful that she he was a new word said
[1:16:01] he had promised so that Sarah came from
[1:16:04] my heart you know I was changed from my
[1:16:07] belief into faith but now she judged him
[1:16:10] faithful that he could do it and it's
[1:16:13] the same with the church I met in the
[1:16:16] end time by Leah where where the
[1:16:18] churches be weighed 2,000 years for the
[1:16:20] promise on they need for us to meet him
[1:16:22] in there right but finally it is a
[1:16:24] people on the earth I mean that they
[1:16:26] have to be turned back to faith again
[1:16:28] back to the Word of God
[1:16:30] I mean that they will receive the
[1:16:31] promise on in the air will be changed
[1:16:34] just like Abraham need to be changed to
[1:16:37] produce the promise of the hour so our
[1:16:39] bodies will be changed to manifest the
[1:16:41] promise of the al-ayam in so I think we
[1:16:46] should just rejoice remember if we have
[1:16:49] received if we have received and then
[1:16:51] the Holy Ghost did every promise in the
[1:16:53] book is out amen
[1:16:56] now brother bird would make a comment
[1:16:59] here and he makes it in a few places of
[1:17:01] people kept your kind of twisties things
[1:17:03] around basis what did what they did a
[1:17:06] Pentecost what they had in the early
[1:17:08] Testament we got today
[1:17:09] and as soon as God can iron the thing
[1:17:12] out and the church get together the
[1:17:14] right
[1:17:14] we'll come but we can't even get faith
[1:17:17] the divine healing let alone direction
[1:17:20] now many people here whatever the devil
[1:17:23] will take this thought that we can't
[1:17:26] even get the faith for divine healing
[1:17:28] and so if we don't see divine healing
[1:17:31] manifested in our bodies did happen we
[1:17:33] have a body change right this is this
[1:17:37] how the devil twisted or not off you
[1:17:39] know you're still sick you prayed you
[1:17:41] believe it doesn't heal you can be a sec
[1:17:43] well if you're still sick you're gonna
[1:17:44] stay here upon the earth no other
[1:17:47] prophet so he says now notice the reason
[1:17:49] this court because with old twists us on
[1:17:52] he's going to answer why can't we even
[1:17:54] have rights the divine healing
[1:17:55] literature because we're all twisted up
[1:17:58] one this way one that way and dr. Sardo
[1:18:01] said there was this while my preacher
[1:18:03] said he was this see he's saying that
[1:18:06] because the word being medicine I mean
[1:18:08] wasn't a word I mean that would reduce
[1:18:10] faith for divine healing
[1:18:11] it wasn't faith you know wasn't a word
[1:18:13] that will produce the pressure and the
[1:18:15] people who was old to us adapt because
[1:18:17] what what was the what was the Prophet
[1:18:20] constantly fighting against the spirit
[1:18:23] of the land saying the days of miracles
[1:18:25] are fast the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:27] is not a lot it's no really more than
[1:18:30] was having for the Apostles I mean
[1:18:32] healing is not doesn't work that way no
[1:18:35] he doesn't need to work that right now I
[1:18:37] had people tell me even in this day I
[1:18:39] mean when you know when I became the new
[1:18:41] Christian is that denominational people
[1:18:42] they would say to me well we are need
[1:18:45] miracles today because your your you
[1:18:47] know the you know these churches in
[1:18:48] around the world we need God the proves
[1:18:50] out that way no more you know we don't
[1:18:53] need them now
[1:18:54] sure all we need it is you know this is
[1:18:56] word but they're actually saying that
[1:18:58] God doesn't do the supernatural level
[1:18:59] but I've gone as a guard of the
[1:19:01] supernatural
[1:19:03] anything that is taught from the toll
[1:19:05] from the scripture if it's really a
[1:19:06] scriptural doctrine I mean God will back
[1:19:09] up supernaturally to praises because God
[1:19:12] is a God of the supernatural to be true
[1:19:14] Sam we can't even get phrase the divine
[1:19:16] healing little interaction because all
[1:19:18] the teaching the churches
[1:19:31] Jesus Christ the same yesterday I mean
[1:20:19] you can even read through the epistles
[1:20:21] of Paul and you can see the condition I
[1:20:25] mean of all those churches I mean our
[1:20:27] prison of the Saints days so so so the
[1:20:33] Corinthians everyone you know there's no
[1:20:36] heat ship if I had assignment you know
[1:20:38] something to say you've come with us all
[1:20:40] out of water they were putting up with
[1:20:42] sin in the church they were that way
[1:20:44] you're rallying around ministry summer
[1:20:47] some of Paul or Paul some of Christ's
[1:20:49] ministry making camps because you can
[1:20:58] see that Corinthians today right you can
[1:21:01] see the Ephesians to say yeah you can
[1:21:02] see the Ephesians today what was wrong
[1:21:04] with the Ephesians he had to remind them
[1:21:07] husbands love your wives wives love your
[1:21:10] husband's he had to actually pull them
[1:21:12] back down into everyday life right even
[1:21:16] though they're all filled with the Holy
[1:21:17] Ghost you know he could actually finally
[1:21:19] teach them big things which was good but
[1:21:22] he had to remind them husbands love your
[1:21:23] wives wives love your husband's how
[1:21:26] y'all family life is is is a reflection
[1:21:28] of the Himmelman
[1:21:30] assured of your
[1:21:31] everyday life has a deeper significance
[1:21:33] and you realize than just raising
[1:21:35] children having a family unit you're
[1:21:38] actually reflecting I'm in a heavenly
[1:21:39] merits I mean so how do you treat your
[1:21:42] spouse how you treat your children as
[1:21:44] actually the word manifested well it
[1:21:46] should be
[1:21:47] amen amen you go to the Thessalonians
[1:21:52] you know I'm in trouble you with you
[1:21:54] know you know a little by spirit away
[1:21:56] from all that the coming the Lord is
[1:21:57] already come and all these things you
[1:21:59] see you can see all those churches
[1:22:01] people are in that yo you can see the
[1:22:03] Galatians for sure that's an easy one
[1:22:05] right you know you can see all what
[1:22:08] because the book of X because during the
[1:22:10] book of X I mean those letters were
[1:22:11] written yeah right
[1:22:14] so you can see people around even
[1:22:17] individuals you can actually see their
[1:22:18] heart their a crimson I remember when
[1:22:20] the Corinthians were believers
[1:22:23] he's a Galatian she's a glacier I will
[1:22:26] believe us this life this alone I can
[1:22:30] believe it right you can you can see all
[1:22:34] those people I mean you can see it all
[1:22:36] living out tonight but we're now Jimmy I
[1:22:38] mean into full maturity amen just keep
[1:22:41] walking
[1:22:42] sorry saying here that you know soon now
[1:22:46] because member faith cometh by hearing
[1:22:47] and hearing by the Word of God and
[1:22:49] because the book has come up and that
[1:22:51] this message is preached in its fullness
[1:22:52] I mean that gives us then dinner
[1:22:55] releases a rupturing phrasing to the
[1:22:56] people Amen hallelujah and then you say
[1:23:03] well how do I know my faith I actually
[1:23:05] have the faith well I received the Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost that's the confirmation I mean
[1:23:09] this is a confirmations of the blame of
[1:23:11] personally hallelujah that God has
[1:23:13] received their faith and God will
[1:23:14] manifest the promise they are in their
[1:23:16] life the big difference from just being
[1:23:18] anointed as someone who's just anointed
[1:23:20] will in regard in the word that was
[1:23:23] right there I made those call during
[1:23:26] episode is just anointed I think that
[1:23:28] we'll stay right in but those should
[1:23:30] make that day God is sealed in their
[1:23:32] souls that will continue walking with
[1:23:34] rod and
[1:23:35] mature and more promises will open up I
[1:23:38] mean more the promise to the one will
[1:23:40] become alive and thereby become more
[1:23:41] like Christ that's why you go and I'll
[1:23:49] say this if you if you if you're
[1:23:51] wondering then seek the Lord about it
[1:23:53] and he'll tell you have a pity party
[1:23:57] all the bodies you can't Patty's are
[1:24:01] cancelled you know I miss her so just
[1:24:09] keep walking now but also what this
[1:24:12] knows God works in more than one way
[1:24:17] right we know God is not a cookie cutter
[1:24:19] you can take David's life for example
[1:24:22] very very elementary but after he used
[1:24:24] the sled against Goliath he doesn't use
[1:24:26] the sling again right they always sought
[1:24:30] the Lord more what why should I you know
[1:24:33] this language sometimes God just had no
[1:24:36] right here by the mobile trace to you
[1:24:38] until you hear the sound of the go and
[1:24:42] do this he always short the Lord I mean
[1:24:46] in every battle I mean he did just plow
[1:24:49] on and say well I'm just gonna do it
[1:24:52] again you know so the lotus-eyed Lord
[1:25:01] will still with them because he had to
[1:25:04] go all the way to the throne right and
[1:25:06] this son did had to sit on this earth
[1:25:09] rights is the same thing with us right
[1:25:11] we must have confidence I'm in this
[1:25:12] anointing this word has come upon us
[1:25:14] well tightness in Timonium right I will
[1:25:17] make us Lord Jesus throne is he right
[1:25:23] we'll do that I will be there wait wait
[1:25:26] wait crisis is the son of David as God
[1:25:28] over the earth king over the earth
[1:25:30] I mean we will sit with the man that
[1:25:32] Dominion and Ezra Holly and then now
[1:25:34] even now we are beginning to sort of
[1:25:36] make the mininum right because the
[1:25:37] Devils are
[1:25:38] now I'm dropping with risen higher even
[1:25:46] you know even even when Jesus you know
[1:25:49] he he said I saw Satan fall like
[1:25:52] lightning from heaven and and brother
[1:25:55] Graham sees the reason that then he said
[1:25:57] that it's because he had just
[1:25:58] commissioned the church I mean to go
[1:26:01] heal the sick cause out the devils he
[1:26:03] just said them he dude the below your
[1:26:05] power and said them full and that's why
[1:26:08] Jesus said that because as soon as the
[1:26:10] church was equipped I made the causative
[1:26:12] laugh but they will found from his
[1:26:14] position and that was determined that
[1:26:21] was before the book came out for duty
[1:26:23] time be obvious enough
[1:26:25] now if cited in that position just
[1:26:28] because they were anointed to God cast
[1:26:30] out the devil people God makes it
[1:26:35] throwing place in the position of the
[1:26:40] people but no he says this and look he
[1:26:46] says when we heard these fine songs I
[1:26:49] said brother elbow I'm glad they've been
[1:26:51] taped because I like to study that I
[1:26:52] like to hear those songs and play the
[1:26:54] tape hear the songs when you can sit
[1:26:56] down there's nothing like music you know
[1:26:58] God heals by music the did you know that
[1:27:03] I live God heals by music God heals by
[1:27:05] love see God heals my medicine God heals
[1:27:08] by prayer God has many ways of healing
[1:27:10] on what type that you need and I want to
[1:27:14] emphasize that later sometimes a little
[1:27:16] love stretched out would just cure an
[1:27:18] old soul I'm an old place there's been a
[1:27:21] gradual something it'll heal it right
[1:27:23] over just a little wobbly little care
[1:27:25] sometimes when you feel little down and
[1:27:27] as we call a street expression down in
[1:27:31] the dumps II just one of those one of
[1:27:34] those tapes that music or record and go
[1:27:36] to playing it the first thing you know
[1:27:38] you're patting your foot or your hand
[1:27:40] it's all over then you're right up
[1:27:42] already to go again but notice he says
[1:27:45] God heals by many different ways but it
[1:27:47] depends on the type you need
[1:27:50] the tents depend on the top we want it
[1:27:53] depends upon type we you need gorgeous
[1:27:56] actually you need to be healed this way
[1:27:58] but the problem is if we are afraid like
[1:28:00] a cookie cutter kind of person walk
[1:28:02] don't repress you heal me if God's going
[1:28:04] to do this you're actually limiting God
[1:28:06] and your life now brother mom would
[1:28:10] speak about the so this is a pretty you
[1:28:13] can say it's the Euro ox of the angle of
[1:28:15] the man and Aladdin and what this
[1:28:17] picture represents is the 40 rooms
[1:28:19] around the throne and revelations four
[1:28:20] and five now we know that these
[1:28:22] anointings now what I like about the
[1:28:24] messages is any any any deep and you
[1:28:27] know any kind of thing that people would
[1:28:29] consider deep in a mystery it's going to
[1:28:31] become applicable to our everyday lives
[1:28:33] as brother John and II said on Tuesday I
[1:28:36] didn't where's the balance right we're
[1:28:38] gonna be all these things need to be
[1:28:40] applicable it's gonna go beyond that
[1:28:41] strict and a nice idea it's gonna come
[1:28:43] down to where we live I mean sorry so
[1:28:46] now we know that the 40 rooms around the
[1:28:50] throne I mean this was for anointings of
[1:28:53] the Holy Ghost that God poured out
[1:28:54] through the ages to come back I'm in the
[1:28:56] Antichrist firm so in the first age I
[1:29:00] mean we you know with the white horse
[1:29:03] rider go forth it was that empty cross
[1:29:05] for deception riding forth and we know
[1:29:08] it wasn't Christ because you compared
[1:29:09] that white horse rider the first yield
[1:29:11] to to the white horse rider in relations
[1:29:14] 19 and symbolically did not the same
[1:29:17] hitter Boehner arrows one headed chapter
[1:29:20] agent so that came out of his mouth one
[1:29:22] didn't heaven and the other one was hold
[1:29:24] the Word of God you can see all that's
[1:29:26] different so so that was a deception
[1:29:28] that rode forth an antichrist spread the
[1:29:30] red for the deception and so God
[1:29:32] anointed the church with a lion
[1:29:33] anointing the word I need to combat what
[1:29:36] they what the enemy was doing and after
[1:29:39] that when the when the Antichrist system
[1:29:41] actually gotta pound the government
[1:29:42] behind them with churches that was
[1:29:44] United now that any Christ verdict could
[1:29:46] control just being a deception but now I
[1:29:49] actually had physical military falls in
[1:29:51] the power of the state I need to
[1:29:52] persecute the church Church I mean
[1:29:54] engine
[1:29:55] and to enter and across role of people
[1:29:57] and the under day religion so of God
[1:29:59] anointed and and that was the age of the
[1:30:01] - Arthur God anointed the church with an
[1:30:03] ox and only King a sacrificial anointing
[1:30:05] that they could gladly gave their lives
[1:30:07] on in the arena or being tortured or
[1:30:09] ever was because they are anointed that
[1:30:11] way to overcome and then of course after
[1:30:16] that you know the black horse rider road
[1:30:18] Falls it was you know you know you're
[1:30:20] you know with the scales and a wit your
[1:30:23] measure of your wheat for a penny
[1:30:25] different things but there's a you catch
[1:30:32] the language of the people say well what
[1:31:59] is this got to do with how God heals
[1:32:01] well pre-assembly God has for you know
[1:32:04] sometimes God will
[1:32:06] supersu just heal us and that's not they
[1:32:09] lie in anointing conservationist touches
[1:32:11] our body
[1:32:12] the sickness leaves right I'm just gonna
[1:32:14] go an order of this picture here from
[1:32:17] right to left
[1:32:17] for some reason you know I sorry so
[1:32:19] sometimes God just super and she heals
[1:32:21] us and and and God touches us we know it
[1:32:24] was God and all the symptoms guy was
[1:32:25] just gone right hallelujah times God
[1:32:30] doesn't always heal us that way now what
[1:32:32] I want to limit doggy just a lion
[1:32:34] anointing healing I mean because I want
[1:32:38] all of God he heals us but I can go back
[1:32:42] to that it depends on what type that you
[1:32:47] need I got that bit underlined here in
[1:32:49] yellow it depends on the type you need
[1:32:50] right because it's all actually a way to
[1:32:54] build and develop because faith worketh
[1:32:57] patience I mean so now there has to be
[1:33:01] the patience pills in the church I mean
[1:33:04] because remember God has sent some
[1:33:05] leeches this all the time I need a job I
[1:33:08] need a house it just happens lord I need
[1:33:10] you know I'm sick poor this happens when
[1:33:13] we have patients become very impatient
[1:33:17] and unfortunately this is a very
[1:33:19] impatient age you know you search
[1:33:22] anything on Google it always tells you
[1:33:24] how many hits and and and how sugar
[1:33:26] target comes but yeah like I searched
[1:33:29] for this it was either how many millions
[1:33:31] of hits of pictures and it was like
[1:33:32] point four five of a second so it tells
[1:33:35] you how much and how quick but God isn't
[1:33:37] always that way because God is
[1:33:39] interested in our character not ass
[1:33:40] getting what we want
[1:33:41] I mean you take the man age you take the
[1:33:45] man anointing right
[1:33:46] sometimes God doesn't heal us decently
[1:33:48] but then sometimes it's it it can appear
[1:33:51] something very natural like house you
[1:33:54] diet are you getting enough sleep
[1:33:57] actually you know I'm winding at the end
[1:34:00] of the day I'm so trouble I'm all this
[1:34:02] you know you know I married hot dogs
[1:34:04] good like a medicine it appear to be a
[1:34:06] very natural thing but this is how God
[1:34:08] heals you know you know medicine is from
[1:34:12] God you know we should make medicine I
[1:34:17] mean cuz actually that might be
[1:34:19] girl wants to heal you well and and
[1:34:23] actually many times I'll say it this way
[1:34:25] many times people who refuse to go as a
[1:34:27] doctor a taxi pride but I'm I should
[1:34:30] need to go down use natural things I'm a
[1:34:32] supernatural being and did another
[1:34:33] actually can just be private right
[1:34:36] so God heals in those ways and then
[1:34:41] there's the eagle anointing I mean when
[1:34:44] I a second trouble that God just drops
[1:34:46] in a revelation lets you high above the
[1:34:48] thing and then you're free but it is
[1:34:52] also the Oxendine thing sometimes you
[1:34:55] actually have to do it will take you to
[1:34:56] death people who die with sickness and
[1:35:01] not unbelievers I made they died in
[1:35:04] faith right so some things that
[1:35:08] literally takes from us other things
[1:35:09] you're going to use man's remedies man's
[1:35:11] healing right change your diet get some
[1:35:15] more sleep
[1:35:16] unwind at the end of the day right go to
[1:35:19] the doctor take your medicine
[1:35:21] amen you see the prophets example was he
[1:35:24] an unbelievable is he wins the doctor
[1:35:26] but seen unbelievable is that Chiru is
[1:35:29] going to be cut out of the side of
[1:35:30] system ET not he was a believer he was a
[1:35:34] dog in position
[1:35:35] I meant but he always went to the doctor
[1:35:39] Amen sorry sorry that's that's another
[1:35:42] way God heals I'm gonna take this
[1:35:43] medication you might have to you can
[1:35:46] actually see all of the teeth we have to
[1:35:48] take everything if we if we can commit
[1:35:51] all our ways to the Lord right then it's
[1:35:55] actually God's given leadership in these
[1:35:57] different ways remember if the Lord
[1:36:00] didn't want you to take the medicine he
[1:36:02] would actually tell you it wouldn't be
[1:36:03] your pride saying no we sang him good
[1:36:07] there's a big difference between our
[1:36:09] pride leading us and God leading us amen
[1:36:13] so you know if he committed all as as as
[1:36:17] God's ways right then it's God leading
[1:36:21] you through these sense you know some
[1:36:24] this is for some reason we you know we
[1:36:27] could actually have to just Bay them for
[1:36:28] years and and they can come and go they
[1:36:32] can get worse and he
[1:36:33] you take the Apostle Paul here's the
[1:36:35] basis it's the H here the problem of
[1:36:37] desires all that you know that thing
[1:36:38] that profited him all the time please
[1:36:40] read that it came it came in at weight
[1:36:43] you know here he was Rosa did that
[1:36:47] incredible things mighty miracles are
[1:36:49] there by the hand to pull BAE et had
[1:36:51] this trouble with his eyes even they
[1:36:53] threatened his disciples sick in another
[1:36:55] place and he traveled to another place
[1:36:56] all these things happened you know but
[1:36:59] it wasn't because he was now believing
[1:37:01] that I believe he was a boy it was
[1:37:04] sealed away in the kingdom of issue and
[1:37:10] and he could see it coming all the us
[1:37:12] cried Lord please take it from me then
[1:37:14] finally at the end of his life his enemy
[1:37:16] was dead right Polly got the victory but
[1:37:19] all the way through his life he had to a
[1:37:21] duel that every about seven years of his
[1:37:22] life
[1:37:23] what's he an unbeliever no sickness in
[1:37:28] the body member the devil has a right to
[1:37:30] afflict our bodies but we not believe is
[1:37:33] because we're healthy oh you ready
[1:37:37] because I'm a clean bill of health
[1:37:39] no we not believe in their bodies a
[1:37:42] healthy is a right to afflict our bodies
[1:37:45] right here's a rock here's a right to
[1:37:48] trouble us in our minds you know singing
[1:37:52] you know
[1:37:53] yeah the promise is this is no-man's
[1:37:54] land this is actually a place of meeting
[1:37:56] of a battlefield
[1:37:57] about a non man's leg you can actually
[1:38:00] ambush and destroy your enemy Olivia I
[1:38:04] mean you just about no man's land like a
[1:38:08] worldly wife the enemy would come out of
[1:38:09] the trenches and and and those defending
[1:38:12] could just gunned them down because they
[1:38:14] had no real place to hide
[1:38:16] The Devil's got another place to hide
[1:38:18] again this was themself in here do you
[1:38:20] know that troubling thoughts and maybe
[1:38:25] something from your past aware maybe
[1:38:26] starting over here he's exposing himself
[1:38:39] just produces unbelief or tries to
[1:38:41] separate you from your friend you'll
[1:38:43] make you be an isolationist what is that
[1:38:45] is that God no identifying when he tries
[1:38:52] to give you a fourth amen and he's just
[1:38:55] he's just now pumping his he never
[1:38:57] brought the trench then you can take his
[1:38:58] health amen so he has a right to trouble
[1:39:04] us in our bodies sickness troubles in
[1:39:06] our spirit but he can't get our soul
[1:39:08] body can't get the soul of the believer
[1:39:11] I mean it's that's God's Dominion that's
[1:39:14] God's place so we get sick in our body
[1:39:18] we get sick and our buddy what happens
[1:39:20] the devil comes law by you're sick you
[1:39:21] can't be a believer and then we begin
[1:39:24] because what does he what is his
[1:39:26] ultimate goal try to make us think like
[1:39:28] him how does he think he's not a real
[1:39:31] believer right he's not a real believer
[1:39:34] this is how he thinks so he's trying to
[1:39:36] get us to think why can't we know the
[1:39:38] sons of God we don't believe it's our
[1:39:40] III you know we get sick he comes as
[1:39:43] long you can't be believing because you
[1:39:44] got sick I've got my metals he comes
[1:39:47] along says you know why because it's not
[1:39:52] me this is the place of meeting forces
[1:39:58] are fighting clashing even though but it
[1:40:03] can't the devil can't touch our soul he
[1:40:06] can't take our faith for months they
[1:40:09] can't take who we really are on the
[1:40:10] inside
[1:40:12] hallelujah always remember they're a new
[1:40:16] program was tenderizing in the Sun 1965
[1:40:19] Hopkins heels of awkward and I was tied
[1:40:21] my I'm hitting me from shots that the
[1:40:23] nurse gave me for leave overseas now as
[1:40:25] you know in a few days oh I have to have
[1:40:28] these shots my son and I with the club
[1:40:30] will with color a yellow fever
[1:40:32] everything I was pretty weary give it
[1:40:34] making me sick which Caesar requires
[1:40:36] have these shots before you gone to
[1:40:38] another nation he said season that's
[1:40:40] what your seasons putting give to God
[1:40:42] that which is God's pretty good balance
[1:40:45] Dungy think so amen but then there's
[1:40:50] also times but then there's also times
[1:40:52] when when when God heals us but it's not
[1:40:55] a but it's not an innocent healing maybe
[1:40:57] but brother Aaron would say this
[1:40:58] difference between a miracle and
[1:40:59] actually divine healing right a miracles
[1:41:03] instant but then divine healing actually
[1:41:06] takes time you notices in mark 16 here
[1:41:10] at the end he says you shall take up
[1:41:12] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:41:15] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[1:41:16] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:41:19] recover so he says don't say that will
[1:41:24] instantly recover they shall recover no
[1:41:28] but so so now what happens is because we
[1:41:31] live in an instant
[1:41:31] age people have hands laid on evil day
[1:41:36] or they go and they are what he call you
[1:41:39] you know you know they they receive a
[1:41:41] promise of God and because it doesn't
[1:41:43] happen instantly because it seems to be
[1:41:45] a delay in the promise coming I mean
[1:41:47] then then that's the time when the deal
[1:41:49] because the whisper be is what must not
[1:41:52] have been real I mean because is it
[1:41:55] delayed it seems to be delayed but God
[1:41:57] is still working but it's like any
[1:41:58] promise of God it's going to be planted
[1:42:01] and then it's going to be watered and it
[1:42:03] is going to grow you know I would say
[1:42:05] what's good is there yeah you know I
[1:42:08] find out if he plants say sake potatoes
[1:42:11] or sweet corn or whatever it may be but
[1:42:15] then every day does open things up see
[1:42:16] if it's growing and actually just
[1:42:18] hinders its growth what but then when
[1:42:21] it's planted and he waters it takes the
[1:42:23] weight away and then he knows that that
[1:42:25] the harvest is on its way
[1:42:28] some things take longer yeah you know
[1:42:31] some things have a longer growing cycle
[1:42:33] than other plants
[1:42:34] what some promises can take longer than
[1:42:37] others there's still the same word right
[1:42:40] but we
[1:42:42] foods what has been positive us it's
[1:42:44] gotta be water with price and the labor
[1:42:46] ahead in December Daisy thank you lord
[1:42:48] my sons coming thank you lord my sons
[1:42:51] coming have a son he's on his way
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:42:58] see to take God at His Word it means
[1:43:02] that you just believe what he's seeing
[1:43:03] and believe of heaven childlike faith
[1:43:07] right you know my children come along
[1:43:11] and now some thirsty they're expecting
[1:43:15] me to give me what you know they're
[1:43:16] expecting me to give them a drink 500 I
[1:43:19] want to hear this and they're waiting
[1:43:22] for my response because they know I have
[1:43:24] the answer
[1:43:25] right they know I have the ability to
[1:43:27] get them a glass of water I mean another
[1:43:30] I can give them a glass of water I can
[1:43:33] make them a sandwich rocket you know
[1:43:34] whatever
[1:43:35] I'm cold with childlike faith believing
[1:43:40] and knowing that I can meet their need I
[1:43:45] need to you know for us we've did the
[1:43:48] same kind of faith with God Lord must
[1:43:51] need well why you but but the very
[1:43:53] reason your eyes here is because you
[1:43:55] know he can fulfill that need and when
[1:43:59] you read the scripture I mean to take
[1:44:01] guard as well as as you realize their
[1:44:05] promises for you and he and he can do it
[1:44:08] and nothing else matters I think oh he
[1:44:12] just taking when Jesus said I do we
[1:44:14] believe all things are possible to live
[1:44:17] not believe I mean he said he's saying
[1:44:20] just believe it don't bring any
[1:44:22] consideration and anything else just
[1:44:24] only believe you believe it means it
[1:44:27] doesn't mean only believe and look at
[1:44:29] your circumstances or hon do you believe
[1:44:31] in look how smart you are only believe
[1:44:33] would look at maybe your track record I
[1:44:35] only believe in and see how much money
[1:44:38] have
[1:44:47] [Applause]
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:16] just look look through those things to
[1:45:19] the promise now I'll just I'll just read
[1:45:24] this coordinate and then we'll leave it
[1:45:26] here but this is in the restoration of
[1:45:28] the pride truth it says there is a Lord
[1:45:30] Christ
[1:45:31] that more is it men you can bury him in
[1:45:34] the to the deepest grave or the deepest
[1:45:37] sea or the lost he'll this is law of the
[1:45:39] Spirit of God that will raise him up
[1:45:41] again see why this is my resurrection
[1:45:43] I bought here's a law that its body is
[1:45:46] material it's earthbound it sits on the
[1:45:49] earth here but it has a laws that it
[1:45:51] that the way it spreads its wings again
[1:45:53] flight climb out of sight that's against
[1:45:56] science they claim it's earthbound
[1:45:57] gravitation has to hold it there but it
[1:46:00] can defy gravitation lift itself right
[1:46:03] off of it and go right on out because it
[1:46:06] has to put and because it has to put
[1:46:08] that law that's in it to work it's built
[1:46:11] to possess that it's built to possess a
[1:46:16] diamond he says non begin to feel
[1:46:18] religious now we have a law the law of
[1:46:20] life that's in us we've done only thing

[1:46:29] knock down to the devil we've got a law
[1:46:31] that's the law of the Holy spirt the

[1:47:00] got to know how to control how the law
[1:47:02] can control him and the same way it is
[1:47:05] with us it isn't what we fight and pull
[1:47:08] and hurry and offer I don't get this if
[1:47:10] I don't get that that's not that's not
[1:47:12] it it is to know that the law of life is

[1:49:17] and and that faith will produce to
[1:49:20] promise the error itself so we don't
[1:49:23] have the push-and-pull worry and stress
[1:49:25] not just walk with God for the purpose
[1:49:29] of the eye has he not yesterday you know
[1:49:34] we get so right about things you know
[1:49:36] you know some people get so cool it up
[1:49:38] and oh my be foolish bridge and I'm
[1:49:40] happy this I'm gonna make it but anymore
[1:49:44] I'll say friend the reason you have that
[1:49:46] in your mind is because because you
[1:49:48] because you're otherwise remember the
[1:49:51] foolish ones don't kid they have their
[1:49:54] church waste you know they just don't
[1:49:55] you know that you'll never miss its
[1:49:57] culture they have a church culture they
[1:49:59] just continue on but the wise one will
[1:50:01] in the ellipse I mean they are concerned
[1:50:04] they are convinced and concerned but but
[1:50:07] but the fools are worried I mean this
[1:50:11] you know there's a story of numbers and
[1:50:13] sorry I said out stuff but I'm going on
[1:50:15] yeah I'm probably ways badly but you
[1:50:17] know there are five daughters in the
[1:50:19] book of numbers and they have no
[1:50:21] brothers they're you're their father
[1:50:22] died in the wilderness and the murchison
[1:50:25] signed it that our father died in a you
[1:50:28] know in his own sins we had not brothers
[1:50:30] to receive in Herod's so we have that
[1:50:33] inheritance in the promised land this is
[1:50:36] the five wise virgins right here they
[1:50:39] actually come I mean they come to a
[1:50:41] prophet saying well actually in the word
[1:50:43] we can't receive any because we're not a
[1:50:44] man but we wanted here in terms of the
[1:50:47] Jordan well along with the rest of us
[1:51:08] means that there's a lot of to you but
[1:51:14] just let God let God take you to it
[1:51:17] hey man that's all we're gonna let go
[1:51:19] and they taught me because the law of
[1:51:21] life of the believer and even though so
[1:51:23] foolish that I'll never have a bird not
[1:51:25] just float on within one ounce I mean
[1:51:28] but I believe I'm looking at the foolish
[1:51:30] I'm looking at the wise man I mean this
[1:51:33] just now he's in a word of Prayer shall

[1:52:21] such confidence in you from this moment
[1:52:23] on Lord Mary realized Flores as his

[1:52:35] promise of the day which is a change in
[1:52:37] the body the Lord also that thought I

[1:52:41] jailer was told to believe on the Lord
[1:52:43] Jesus Christ as my house shall be saved
[1:52:46] Lord has the same faith II had returned
[1:52:48] celebration then he plead for his for

[1:53:11] the Scarecrow's and the lie and the
[1:53:13] sickness and the fear the things that
[1:53:15] they'll try to put in front of us Lord
[1:53:17] to look to take our vision of the
