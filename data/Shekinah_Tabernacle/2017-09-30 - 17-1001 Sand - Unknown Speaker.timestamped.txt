[53:15] Hey
[53:17] [Music]
[53:25] we'll just pray this morning Lord Jesus
[53:29] we thank you that in the times of a
[53:31] storm Lord that we can look to you for
[53:35] you are our peace Lord this broken and
[53:38] ev'ry wall Lord on the other Master a
[53:41] ruby circumstance over every situation
[53:43] and there's nothing that's too hard for
[53:45] you there's nothing that you can't
[53:46] overcome Lord Jesus I'm so confident in
[53:50] your word and your deliverance Lord the
[53:54] fact that you are Almighty God you are
[53:57] the way you are the truth your other
[53:58] life Lord we thank you for the anchor
[54:01] that our soul has and you Lord that we
[54:04] have an anchor that keeps the soul
[54:05] steadfast and sure well the billows roll
[54:08] and we just want to worship you this
[54:10] morning and give you thanks for all that
[54:13] you've done in our lives for calling
[54:15] each one of us and for being faithful
[54:18] Lord and times when we weren't faithful
[54:20] you are faithful Lord and times when we
[54:22] were weak
[54:23] you were strong Lord and we acknowledge
[54:26] that all our strength comes from you
[54:28] Lord that that at that point where our
[54:31] human ability and a human strength came
[54:34] to an end Lord when your strength
[54:36] started that's when we realized that
[54:37] that's the true victory has been Paul
[54:40] said it's no longer I that loveth the
[54:42] Christ that liveth of me and I can do
[54:44] all things through Christ who
[54:45] strengtheneth me so we thank you for
[54:48] your strength you think you for your
[54:49] love we think if your grace is one of
[54:50] your you'll it
[54:51] bless us this morning bless our pastor
[54:54] Immunization Papa you're getting
[54:57] emotional timers the air if it's the
[54:58] same as here or what but I just pray you
[55:00] bless them this morning no doubt there'd
[55:01] be meetings odd and things happening so
[55:04] I just want to pray continually so
[55:05] Murphy's ministry off another brothers
[55:07] and we just trusting for your
[55:10] undertaking the year Lord that their
[55:11] Saints will be blessed their souls will
[55:14] be one into the kingdom of God that they
[55:19] thought if there really that needs
[55:21] strength that we strengthened if the
[55:22] renew that need encouragement they'd be
[55:24] encouraged you neither need Lord
[55:25] chastisement they'd be chastised
[55:26] whenever your work would be there this
[55:29] morning we just confident that your
[55:30] spirit will achieve its purpose so we
[55:33] just commit ourselves to you and thank
[55:34] you Lord for your grace in Jesus name
[55:35] Amen amen god bless you this morning
[55:40] brother John's guitar string broke that
[55:43] you who notice that there's a lesson in
[55:53] that you know you need all the guitar
[56:00] you need all of the pieces and they're
[56:02] working for it all to sound nice and I
[56:04] think we you know we are like that as as
[56:07] believers in a local body internet and
[56:10] an international body too but in their
[56:11] local body we've all got our little part
[56:13] to play in the body you know when when
[56:15] one of them is not there when it goes
[56:17] it's not quite the same it just wasn't
[56:19] the same once a string broke you know
[56:20] when it wasn't there so I know you did
[56:24] you were doing all sorts of different he
[56:26] was trying to play on another fritz a
[56:28] sort of to compensate for it and hey we
[56:30] try and do the same you know when when
[56:33] one of the Saints out there we try and
[56:35] do something different to try and make
[56:36] it work but it's not it's never quite
[56:37] the same and so we all have our place to
[56:40] our part to play in the body of Christ I
[56:43] mean so don't forget that if you ever
[56:45] think you're insignificant just think of
[56:46] John's string it wasn't the same way it
[56:49] was gone
[56:50] amen thank you musicians my verse I've
[56:54] got one versus morning as Genesis 1
[56:56] verse 1 them now I generally um
[57:03] don't I use an iPad all the time now
[57:06] from my Bible just because it's quicker
[57:08] to search the verses in there oh that
[57:11] broke so I'm down to my slides I've got
[57:14] my thumb and my phone but it's a simple
[57:17] vs. we all know this one in the
[57:19] beginning God created the heaven and the
[57:20] earth
[57:21] I mean God created the heaven in the
[57:25] earth
[57:25] you can have your seats this morning
[57:28] I've got a just an interesting thought
[57:31] that the Lord's laid on my heart this
[57:32] morning and I know brother bin would say
[57:37] you know take your liberty and and that
[57:43] could mean two things it could mean you
[57:45] know do and say whatever you want to do
[57:46] or it could mean just take your liberty
[57:48] just to work within the bounds that
[57:50] you've got and I prefer to go that way
[57:51] because the I'm not really like I'm not
[58:00] I'm not in charge of you people I'm just
[58:02] - I'm a brother I'm a friend you know I
[58:03] don't have when I was pastoring a church
[58:05] it was slightly different because I had
[58:06] a there was a responsibility via so say
[58:09] there was more of a burden on me but
[58:11] it's quite nice ministering under these
[58:12] circumstances because it's not quite the
[58:14] responsibility although I love your
[58:16] honor care and all that sort of thing
[58:17] there's not quite the responsibility do
[58:19] not I mean Christine so I take that
[58:23] liberty and sort of just I enjoy it's
[58:26] like when you work for someone you know
[58:27] that yet your responsibilities aren't
[58:29] the same as if your own the company it's
[58:30] just the way that it is so and I quite I
[58:33] just enjoy being a spare time ministry
[58:35] coming in when we're numb brother Ben
[58:37] needs me to come in and preach although
[58:39] the last time I was supposed to the
[58:41] spare tire was flat because I'd lost all
[58:45] the sermons I'd actually lost all of
[58:47] this well I try and get two or three
[58:48] ahead so that we and brother bin need
[58:51] someone I can just step up and do it but
[58:53] I like to do something just slightly
[58:55] different because I know brother bin
[58:56] would like that just to know something
[58:58] different than what we usually have and
[58:59] then it makes him look better which is
[59:03] well that's what my job is is to make
[59:04] him look good you know that's my job hey
[59:07] we really respect by the beam we enjoy
[59:10] his ministry we enjoy his labor of love
[59:12] that he does for us and I want to
[59:14] support that and I think
[59:15] ah reward for me and supporting that and
[59:18] all of you people as well and it's an
[59:20] honorable thing to support leadership
[59:21] and pastors in that it's very honorable
[59:23] so so I've got an interesting thought
[59:25] this morning called sand and I was just
[59:28] praying one night a while back
[59:30] and I think I was thinking about what
[59:32] maybe I could Minister on next and the
[59:34] thought came sand and it's kind of one
[59:38] of those sorts where you think man how
[59:39] can I get a sermon out of sand you know
[59:42] it's a seems like a very small subject
[59:45] to try and extract 45 minutes or an hour
[59:49] from but my brain working the way that
[59:53] it does it kind of just laws away at
[59:55] something and digs away at it and fishes
[59:56] things out and keeps on digging and
[59:58] digging and digging till he gets
[1:00:01] something out of it and his brother and
[1:00:02] he would say to the gates of the rock it
[1:00:04] was very interesting what he said about
[1:00:05] the sand the other day said you know
[1:00:07] that you got to dig down till you find
[1:00:08] the rock thanks for all the sand but now
[1:00:12] like a week excuse me people I'll just
[1:00:15] see if this guy's good okay so so now
[1:00:19] God God was a great creator when you
[1:00:20] created created not my chance but with a
[1:00:24] lot of thought involved all these
[1:00:25] different and and in a Natural Landmark
[1:00:30] since all these different things like
[1:00:32] mountains and rivers and things and then
[1:00:33] when he is relating himself or or try to
[1:00:36] make a point about something he often
[1:00:38] brings in things that we can see he'll
[1:00:40] bring in mountains and rivers and rocks
[1:00:42] and things like that they're they are
[1:00:44] human mind can look at and understand
[1:00:45] then he likens that to a principle he's
[1:00:47] trying to say and so he when we think of
[1:00:52] these things we have any times with you
[1:00:54] hear the word Mountain mentioned in
[1:00:56] Scripture
[1:00:56] lots and lots of times because it's
[1:00:58] quite a significant thing a mountain
[1:01:00] it's more than a flat plane or a little
[1:01:03] small hill at a mountain there's
[1:01:06] something about a mountain you've got
[1:01:07] mountains in who knows what this
[1:01:10] mountainous I'll give you one guess
[1:01:21] Everest there as Mount Everest
[1:01:25] 29,000 feet above sea level cruising
[1:01:28] altitude of a 747 that's a big mountain
[1:01:31] so that's Mount Everest but Psalm 36
[1:01:35] verse 6 says though righteousness is
[1:01:38] like the great deep it's like the great
[1:01:41] mountains and though judgments are a
[1:01:43] great deep Oh Lord thou preserve us man
[1:01:45] and beast
[1:01:45] so God saying this is what my
[1:01:48] righteousness is like this mountain
[1:01:49] that's just advanced and sure so we can
[1:01:52] perceive as righteousness like that I've
[1:01:55] always thought of this verse here this
[1:01:58] is talking about a river proverbs 21
[1:02:01] says the king's heart is in the hand of
[1:02:03] the Lord as the rivers of water he
[1:02:05] turneth it will this river he will and
[1:02:08] you mentioned the river turns this way
[1:02:09] then it turns that way and turns that
[1:02:10] way God saying I'm a charge of the
[1:02:12] king's hat and I and I I direct him the
[1:02:14] way that I want to direct him like this
[1:02:16] river and so we can look at this river I
[1:02:18] think well if that was my heart and the
[1:02:19] Lord wanted it to go that way then you
[1:02:21] would turn it that way and it would go
[1:02:21] this way so that's what our heart is
[1:02:23] like as well something that we can
[1:02:25] perceive rocks
[1:02:29] he talks often about rocks like judo and
[1:02:32] Jiu tirana me 33 says he is the rock his
[1:02:36] work is perfect for all his way as a
[1:02:38] judgment a God of truth and without
[1:02:39] iniquity just and right as here so God
[1:02:42] is like a rock that's a big rock amazing
[1:02:45] rock formations oh it's amazing what the
[1:02:47] Lord can make and how he can make all
[1:02:49] his creation make things as well he can
[1:02:51] make the elements just make different
[1:02:52] things and make it so amazing and so
[1:02:54] beautiful so now we have the issue of
[1:02:58] sand that you think how does he talk
[1:03:02] about sand I've got some pictures of
[1:03:05] different areas in the world that have
[1:03:08] sand it's quite an amazing substance
[1:03:13] really you've got you know we maybe
[1:03:15] think of beach sand but there are a lot
[1:03:17] of different places that have sand other
[1:03:18] than just the beach I think these are
[1:03:19] you've got a lot of desert sands
[1:03:21] blacks and whites and this well that's
[1:03:26] like a golden sand this is a white sand
[1:03:28] and the desert these are both top ones
[1:03:30] at the ends
[1:03:30] it's an amazing substance and there's a
[1:03:32] lot of it around once it's and then all
[1:03:35] these funny places I think that this
[1:03:38] road has sand like a sandy substance
[1:03:40] there yeah so I don't know what I've got
[1:03:44] next so if this is as interesting as it
[1:03:46] is I haven't gone over this a lot here
[1:03:49] we go this is these are very close-up
[1:03:52] pictures of sand like maybe 1 centimeter
[1:03:55] by 1 centimeter of sand so they look
[1:03:56] like peoples but they're actually small
[1:03:58] tiny grains of sand that's one from the
[1:04:01] Mongolia beautiful day it's a little
[1:04:03] quartz and stuff that's one meter one
[1:04:05] centimeter by 1 centimeter this one it's
[1:04:07] a more of a beach sand over here
[1:04:09] California it's got they would have
[1:04:11] small showers and things in it that the
[1:04:12] waves and everything over time have just
[1:04:14] ground down these little pieces of sand
[1:04:16] this this there's a printed sand from
[1:04:19] Egypt the one in the middle oh here we
[1:04:20] go is it Oh yep that's a patents and I
[1:04:25] think the wind from blowing the sand
[1:04:27] around has made it all pitted but um one
[1:04:32] up the top here that's a it looks orange
[1:04:35] but it's a pink sand from Utah have you
[1:04:38] seen that where as they're Americans
[1:04:40] have you seen it
[1:04:42] where's cherith oh no she can't hear me
[1:04:46] that's from Utah and the one down the
[1:04:50] bottom here is a that's a volcanic sand
[1:04:53] from Greece a black sand black sands
[1:04:56] looks quite awesome too
[1:04:58] so you've got all this when you zoom in
[1:05:01] close to the sanders it's an amazing
[1:05:02] substance very very amazing substance
[1:05:05] and I've just thought I'll look into the
[1:05:08] things that people you stand for and
[1:05:09] generally it's more bigger things like
[1:05:13] agriculture they use it too for a
[1:05:17] drainage and slow so the saw doesn't get
[1:05:18] so hard query how to push the reefs they
[1:05:21] fill sandbags up and make artificial
[1:05:23] reefs with it artificial islands I think
[1:05:26] a lot of the Abu Dhabi and all those
[1:05:29] Dubai and all those areas here are
[1:05:30] basically built on a lot of them are
[1:05:32] built on water so they've just made land
[1:05:34] from sand filled up then sandbags and
[1:05:36] things for beach nourishment I think one
[1:05:38] of the beaches and Wellington here
[1:05:39] Oriental Bay I think that was rock at
[1:05:41] some point they just brought in sand
[1:05:42] put that down there Brookes big things
[1:05:44] like that they put a lot of sand and
[1:05:46] bricks concrete glass glass has sent
[1:05:50] hydraulic fracturing to get the sand
[1:05:54] into get the oil out with the water in
[1:05:56] different substances water paint roads
[1:05:58] roads sandbag sandblasting this was an
[1:06:01] interesting one a thermal weapon base to
[1:06:04] use sand as a weapon back in the olden
[1:06:06] times the thermal weapon which means
[1:06:08] they heated up sand and I guess when
[1:06:10] guys are coming up to the wall they
[1:06:11] poured sand all over them hot sand I
[1:06:14] don't know if it would have been overly
[1:06:15] effective I mean they would have taken a
[1:06:17] long time to heat the snuff and you've
[1:06:18] got you get one shot of pouring it if
[1:06:20] the guys that have moves out the way all
[1:06:21] your if it's a but they used that for a
[1:06:23] while the thermal weapon and there was
[1:06:25] another interesting month is there's
[1:06:27] little creatures that don't have any and
[1:06:29] the cedar don't have any skeleton and
[1:06:31] they eat sand and it kind of gives them
[1:06:34] a bit of skeleton the name strange a the
[1:06:36] things the Lord makes he just wants to
[1:06:39] surprise us all the time and the more we
[1:06:41] look the more we find me one of the
[1:06:45] things we probably use the most other
[1:06:46] side from maybe glass and that is our in
[1:06:48] our computer chips the a lot of the
[1:06:53] chips are made from there's a lot of
[1:06:54] silicon in there which is which comes
[1:06:56] from the sand they use these a triumph I
[1:06:59] understand that has the most silicon and
[1:07:01] they use it to make computer chips
[1:07:02] strange what man does he can take
[1:07:04] something and make something else
[1:07:05] without out of it
[1:07:06] he's similar to God and that creates
[1:07:08] things but now going back to the Bible
[1:07:13] we're talking about sin there's a lot of
[1:07:15] examples where God talks about sand and
[1:07:17] I just want to run through some of those
[1:07:18] the first one was Abraham and we know
[1:07:22] the story of Abraham he was he was
[1:07:24] living in Iraq up there wandering around
[1:07:27] and then God met him and he gave him a
[1:07:31] promise and he said Abraham I want you
[1:07:33] to leave here and go to another place
[1:07:34] and he said the promise is that implicit
[1:07:37] I'll bless thee and in multiplying I'll
[1:07:39] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:07:41] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[1:07:43] seashore and those seed shall possess
[1:07:45] the gates of his enemies so that's the
[1:07:47] first time God mentions sand to men
[1:07:49] saying I'm gonna bless you and I'm going
[1:07:51] to make your seed like a sand upon the
[1:07:53] seashore
[1:07:55] and as time went on Abraham would have
[1:07:59] told that promise to Isaac and then
[1:08:00] Isaac would have told that promise to
[1:08:02] Jacob and then we know the story of
[1:08:05] Jacob he left his he deceived his
[1:08:07] brother then he went up with us where
[1:08:08] his father-in-law was and then in a
[1:08:10] certain point in time he wanted to come
[1:08:12] back down but he had to meet up with
[1:08:15] Esau again his brother that had deceived
[1:08:17] and robbed them
[1:08:19] basically he ruined his life and so you
[1:08:23] can imagine that the hard the thoughts
[1:08:26] that are going through jacob's mind the
[1:08:29] pressure that and the days leading up
[1:08:31] and the night before he has to meet with
[1:08:33] Esau and he devises a plan where he
[1:08:37] thinks oh I'll send all these gifts
[1:08:39] first and I was in no camels and
[1:08:41] everything then I'll send my wife and
[1:08:43] children after that see he sends all
[1:08:45] these other people first to try and
[1:08:47] appease Esau so that finally when he
[1:08:49] comes
[1:08:50] hopefully he saw won't just decide to
[1:08:51] kill him because he still had become
[1:08:53] quite a powerful man by that stage he
[1:08:56] had soldiers and he was a very strong
[1:08:58] man and himself in and with us with a
[1:09:00] small army that he had so you can
[1:09:02] imagine the pressure that Jacob is under
[1:09:05] the night before his due to meet um Esau
[1:09:09] and he's praying to the Lord and he's
[1:09:15] realizing there's a promise for me and
[1:09:17] he recites back to God the promise that
[1:09:20] had been passed down to him that which
[1:09:21] was part of the best way which is part
[1:09:22] of everything and this is before he
[1:09:26] wrestled with the angel but Jacob said
[1:09:29] to God that you taught me you will
[1:09:31] surely do me good and make my seed like
[1:09:34] the sand upon the seashore
[1:09:35] you've recited that back to God which
[1:09:38] cannot be numbered for multitude
[1:09:39] so he's were psyching that back and
[1:09:42] thinking that's what you said of me I
[1:09:44] don't think I'm going to I think I'm
[1:09:45] going to survive this but he recited
[1:09:47] that back and then later on that night
[1:09:48] was when he wrestled with the angel and
[1:09:52] and when the morning came the angel said
[1:09:55] let me go and he said I won't let you go
[1:09:57] until you bless me and then God changed
[1:10:00] his name to Israel now this is a
[1:10:04] fascinating fascinating subject for
[1:10:08] mankind as the subject of Israel there
[1:10:12] was a man an atheist and he asked a
[1:10:15] Christian being smart - my thing of
[1:10:16] talking us before but he said prove me
[1:10:18] Christianity in two words and this man
[1:10:21] said the Jews and when you think about
[1:10:26] the significance of the Jews
[1:10:28] it proves God so I thought I did a
[1:10:32] little study on this I don't know if you
[1:10:35] can see these words Andy's at the back
[1:10:39] you can't see but this is a list of all
[1:10:40] the countries in the whole wide world
[1:10:42] all the countries that we have here
[1:10:45] you'll find your country of origin in
[1:10:48] there I think your point South Africa be
[1:10:53] maybe you've got career this career do
[1:10:58] you something
[1:10:59] oh I'd be sick maybe yes sorry South
[1:11:02] Korea South Korea North yep New Zealand
[1:11:05] if I hit that blown-up you could search
[1:11:07] you can look over all those countries
[1:11:09] and you you find me a country in the
[1:11:11] other the first the first commissioners
[1:11:15] it has to be named after a person a
[1:11:16] person's name then the second thing is
[1:11:20] you've got to that country also as well
[1:11:23] as being a person's name has to be
[1:11:24] essentially the people living in their
[1:11:26] country we're all descendants of that
[1:11:27] person you look through all these
[1:11:29] countries the closest I came was these
[1:11:32] ones over here like st. Kitts and st.
[1:11:34] Lucia and statements and they're named
[1:11:36] after a person's name but that's just
[1:11:39] because the the Spanish meet there and
[1:11:41] they had some saint that they thought
[1:11:44] was good so they called they took over
[1:11:45] this country that we'll call it st.
[1:11:46] Kitts you know but it's nothing to do
[1:11:48] with st. Kitts not his genealogy but
[1:11:52] well then this with an all these
[1:11:53] countries in the world here there's this
[1:11:54] little country down here called Israel
[1:11:56] yes a person's name and the people in
[1:12:01] that country can say I traced back to
[1:12:03] that person there's there are no other
[1:12:08] countries in the world like that because
[1:12:10] God said your seed will be like the sand
[1:12:13] upon the seashore for multitude
[1:12:15] if you ever doubt God just look at this
[1:12:17] and think why they why is this little
[1:12:19] country still sitting there after all
[1:12:21] these years
[1:12:21] because there's a promise that your seed
[1:12:24] will be like the sand upon the seashore
[1:12:25] and amongst all these other countries
[1:12:27] that's sitting there saying I'm not
[1:12:28] because God said you won't move you'll
[1:12:30] stay there you'll stand through all the
[1:12:33] time
[1:12:33] as long as the wheelchair you'll be
[1:12:35] there that proves God any atheist can
[1:12:39] look at us and say if they weren't there
[1:12:41] you could just regard the whole thing
[1:12:42] almost but Israel is there it's there
[1:12:45] praise the Lord because they see we like
[1:12:47] to stand up on the seashore I've got
[1:12:50] another one
[1:12:50] moving on Joseph I enjoy the story of
[1:12:54] Joseph because it's it's one of up and
[1:12:57] then down and then up
[1:12:58] so Joseph was a very blessed boy when he
[1:13:01] was born his father loved him and he
[1:13:02] would have had a lot of confidence and
[1:13:04] maybe he got the love of his father more
[1:13:07] than his brothers dead and his father
[1:13:08] was older by the in so his father was
[1:13:10] more lenient upon him and more maybe
[1:13:12] like a granddad than a dad you know
[1:13:14] whereas the older boys Reuben and Simeon
[1:13:16] I mean maybe they got the the harder end
[1:13:19] of the stick you know and they maybe got
[1:13:21] a few more punishments and things but
[1:13:23] here's Joseph being there as a mobile
[1:13:25] put it the son of his old age he was a
[1:13:27] bit more nicer to him and just hey come
[1:13:29] and Joseph sort of my life and look more
[1:13:31] like a grandfather didn't really create
[1:13:33] him as much and maybe didn't have to
[1:13:35] work as much as the older boys and he
[1:13:38] was very spiritual and I think he would
[1:13:40] have had a lot of confidence growing up
[1:13:42] Joseph would off and his brothers as a
[1:13:46] result of seeing their the dynamics play
[1:13:48] out his brothers just didn't like this
[1:13:51] guy hated them they were jealous of him
[1:13:53] that his father liked him more than them
[1:13:55] what they will perceive and then it got
[1:13:59] even worse to me and Joseph started
[1:14:00] having all these dreams you can imagine
[1:14:02] as brothers Joseph starts having these
[1:14:05] dreams and telling his brothers
[1:14:06] essentially the interpretation this
[1:14:08] you're all going to bow down to me you
[1:14:11] know if that's not if that's not kicking
[1:14:13] a man while he's down here's a really
[1:14:15] this boy that already been spoiled in
[1:14:17] saying oh and on top of that you're also
[1:14:18] going to bow down to me and worship me
[1:14:19] and then he turns out to his father and
[1:14:22] says oh my father mother you will as
[1:14:23] well actually talking about alienating
[1:14:27] himself from his family you know but hey
[1:14:29] God does strange things that we just
[1:14:30] have to go with what God said and then
[1:14:33] he got his coat of many colors and then
[1:14:35] he was he was happy and confident
[1:14:38] everything was going well and then he
[1:14:39] went out to meet his brothers to bring
[1:14:41] them something out in the field was his
[1:14:42] father's he can to bring them some food
[1:14:43] and things and his brothers thought this
[1:14:46] is a timely we can get rid of this guy
[1:14:48] because we just done with this little
[1:14:50] guy he's always I think even as presence
[1:14:53] made him angry so they caught him threw
[1:14:58] up they were going to kill him but the
[1:14:59] one of the brothers said don't kill him
[1:15:00] let's let's just keep him alive we'll
[1:15:01] sell him to these slave traders you know
[1:15:03] they these guys that were trading slaves
[1:15:06] now Egypt was a big country at that time
[1:15:08] the big enough that it was had a big
[1:15:10] commercial enterprise going on the
[1:15:11] economy was going well and other
[1:15:13] countries was were essentially catching
[1:15:16] people and exporting them to Egypt as
[1:15:19] slaves to build all the things they are
[1:15:20] building and the buildings and things
[1:15:23] like that so that that shows that Egypt
[1:15:25] was a thriving economy and where they
[1:15:28] were in the desert I don't know but
[1:15:29] along comes this slave train with all
[1:15:33] these slaves there was probably a lot of
[1:15:35] them all sort of making their way you
[1:15:36] can imagine from all around Egypt while
[1:15:38] making their way and bringing all these
[1:15:39] slaves and and so they must have waved
[1:15:41] this thing down and said hey we've got
[1:15:43] the slave he will sell them to you
[1:15:44] that'll be a way to get rid of this guy
[1:15:46] so they sold Joseph and brother Ben has
[1:15:48] talked about this quite often and I've
[1:15:50] always found it such a great point that
[1:15:52] here was Joseph he had all these
[1:15:53] promises and here he was on the slave
[1:15:56] train moving the opposite way to what
[1:15:59] would seem the promise for his life but
[1:16:02] as time went on he went there and he did
[1:16:04] well and he worked hard it would have
[1:16:07] been hell for him to learn the language
[1:16:08] and do things like that I mean then his
[1:16:11] next hit came when he got thrown in
[1:16:13] prison again he can imagine the thoughts
[1:16:15] that were going through Joseph's mind
[1:16:16] when he thinks it's all going quite well
[1:16:18] and then suddenly bang he's back in
[1:16:19] prison and I think he was in there for
[1:16:21] maybe seven or eight years a long time
[1:16:22] it wasn't just a few weeks and whoops we
[1:16:25] made a mistake you're out it was a long
[1:16:26] time for Joseph but he he trusted in God
[1:16:31] and then we know the story that about
[1:16:34] the the butler and and how Joseph
[1:16:35] eventually was to live and put out of
[1:16:37] prison because he interpreted Pharaoh's
[1:16:39] dream and Farah had a dream about the
[1:16:42] wheat and the cows are saying and and
[1:16:45] Joseph said this is the interpretation
[1:16:46] there's going to be seven years of FEM
[1:16:49] of of plenty and then seven years of
[1:16:51] famine and in fear I perceive this to be
[1:16:57] correct so he said okay
[1:16:59] Joseph see we need somebody to manage
[1:17:02] this whole enterprise for seven years
[1:17:03] look after it then to distribute the
[1:17:05] food for seven years and so Pharaoh gave
[1:17:07] Joseph the job to harvest all the the
[1:17:12] grain in the seven years and then store
[1:17:14] it up now that's where we get to the
[1:17:16] scripture here and Joseph the city is
[1:17:18] Albany stood before Pharaoh thirty king
[1:17:21] of Egypt and Joseph went out from the
[1:17:22] presence of Pharaoh and went throughout
[1:17:24] all the land of Egypt this is after
[1:17:25] Pharaoh told him and in the seven years
[1:17:27] the earth brought forth by handfuls and
[1:17:29] he gathered up all the food of the seven
[1:17:30] years which were in the land of Egypt
[1:17:31] and he laid up the food in the cities
[1:17:33] the food of the field which was round
[1:17:35] about in every city
[1:17:37] verse 41 that says and Joseph gathered
[1:17:40] corn as a sand of the sea very much
[1:17:43] until he left numbering for it was
[1:17:45] without number I think at some point
[1:17:48] Joseph would have done a rough
[1:17:49] calculation and thought we need about
[1:17:51] this much grain so he started keeping
[1:17:53] track of how much he was harvesting mean
[1:17:56] the scripture says it got to a point
[1:17:57] where he thought I'm just going to give
[1:17:59] up trying to number how much of the
[1:18:00] stuff that I've got because I can't
[1:18:02] number it it's ginormous
[1:18:04] massive he gathered corn as a sand of
[1:18:08] the seashore now my little brain working
[1:18:10] how it does I kind of don't like to just
[1:18:12] leave it at that
[1:18:13] so look into it a little bit more yes
[1:18:17] have you gathered it like the sand of
[1:18:18] the seashore they must have in a lot now
[1:18:20] the population of Egypt this is a
[1:18:23] conservative estimate was about seven
[1:18:25] million some say ten some say twenty but
[1:18:28] I go conservative because then you could
[1:18:30] always increase the numbers the
[1:18:31] population of Egypt is about seven
[1:18:33] million at that time there were seven
[1:18:36] years of famine firstly I didn't allow
[1:18:38] for the first year because you'd think
[1:18:40] they would still be crops from the last
[1:18:42] year right which is true but then on the
[1:18:45] other end of the famine you've got even
[1:18:47] when it starts again you've got to go
[1:18:48] for another year before your next crop
[1:18:50] comes on so it was seven years I had six
[1:18:52] years but then I put it to seven so it's
[1:18:55] 2550 five days now this is a
[1:18:58] conservative estimate could you live on
[1:19:00] five ears of corn a day
[1:19:02] if you had to you if you had so you
[1:19:05] probably could you'd look like I don't
[1:19:07] mind at the end of it but you could
[1:19:11] let's just say five because if I see it
[1:19:13] 15 you're saying no not 15 let's just
[1:19:15] say five to be conservative right five
[1:19:18] now I've it even allowed for the
[1:19:19] livestock or anything like that there's
[1:19:20] just five years of corn seven million
[1:19:23] people that times five is eighty nine
[1:19:25] billion but also it says that people
[1:19:27] from all around the other countries came
[1:19:29] in and brought corn just like um Isaac
[1:19:35] and as and Jos sorry jacket minute
[1:19:37] Joseph's brethren came in and brought
[1:19:39] corn there were a lot of those people so
[1:19:40] I've only allowed about a million of
[1:19:42] those coming from all around because
[1:19:44] Egypt was the place to go
[1:19:47] so this 102 to be conservative is 102
[1:19:51] billion ears of corn
[1:19:52] I'll just give you some perspective on
[1:19:55] that this is a thirty foot by 30 foot
[1:19:57] grain silo very big grain silo you see
[1:20:01] you know I've seen these things
[1:20:03] now this holds seven hundred and sixty
[1:20:05] eight thousand ears of corn now that's
[1:20:08] that's without the cob
[1:20:10] so if Joseph stored the stuff with a cob
[1:20:12] we're talking far more than what my
[1:20:15] estimates are but let's say he did take
[1:20:16] the the grain off the cob because this
[1:20:19] is this is shelled corn
[1:20:22] seem homeless sixty eight so so now if
[1:20:26] you do these calculations they need two
[1:20:28] hundred Joseph needs one hundred and
[1:20:30] thirty three thousand of these grain
[1:20:31] silos conservatively to store all his
[1:20:34] corn this is a massive operation this is
[1:20:38] a massive food storage program probably
[1:20:40] the biggest food storage program in
[1:20:42] existence of the world wellington city
[1:20:46] has seventy seven thousand Wellings
[1:20:51] Lower Hutt has 38 thousand and Upper
[1:20:54] Hutt has 16,000 dwellings all up there
[1:20:57] 131 thousand plus commercial buildings
[1:21:00] is about one hundred and thirty three
[1:21:01] thousand dwellings so essentially every
[1:21:03] single building in the Wellington it
[1:21:06] goes up to tower and all through the
[1:21:08] Hutt Valley would have been a grain silo
[1:21:10] you could walk through these things for
[1:21:12] days grain silos
[1:21:16] Joseph gathered corn like the sand on
[1:21:19] the seashore from multitude and he
[1:21:23] couldn't count it he gave us so much he
[1:21:25] bought the whole land of Egypt he bought
[1:21:28] the whole in because as people were
[1:21:30] getting hungrier and hungrier he just
[1:21:31] kept on buying everything he said and
[1:21:33] they had no money left he said rod I'll
[1:21:34] take your land I'll take your land he
[1:21:36] bought the whole country from all the
[1:21:38] Egyptians by the end of the famine
[1:21:40] Pharaoh owned the whole land outright
[1:21:42] himself amazing indeed but God doesn't
[1:21:45] think God wants to do something he does
[1:21:46] he can do something big you can do
[1:21:47] something small Joseph get the grain
[1:21:51] like the sand upon the seashore for
[1:21:53] multitude I've got another one here this
[1:21:57] is Gideon we know the story of Gideon he
[1:21:58] thinks he's insignificant yeah I'm a
[1:22:00] nobody
[1:22:01] and in the a Jew comes Tillman's he's
[1:22:03] getting a new mighty man of Valor and he
[1:22:07] didn't think that he was but God told
[1:22:10] Gideon I'm gonna use you to deliver your
[1:22:12] people so over the course of time Gideon
[1:22:18] gets an army together and he's going to
[1:22:21] fight the Amalekites and the I can't
[1:22:24] remember the name of the other army but
[1:22:26] because they were always robbing him
[1:22:28] this way when the angel came to him he
[1:22:29] was hiding away threshing his wheat and
[1:22:31] trying to keep it all hidden because it
[1:22:32] would always get stolen he was a him and
[1:22:35] his people were oppressed continually
[1:22:37] oppressed who knows what it's like to be
[1:22:39] oppressed you know sometimes you go
[1:22:41] through your life and times and your
[1:22:42] life were you just oppressed and you say
[1:22:44] Lord deliver me
[1:22:44] I'm oppressed and you are oppressed but
[1:22:47] God will deliver you and and Gideon
[1:22:50] Gideon was at a time in his life where
[1:22:52] he wasn't free and his people went free
[1:22:54] they were oppressed so so things happen
[1:22:59] and Gideon ends up getting an army and
[1:23:01] now he starts thinking with his mind the
[1:23:04] bigger the army the more chance I've got
[1:23:05] a shot of delivering my people from this
[1:23:09] from these Amalekites so being the
[1:23:12] prudence of men that maybe he was and
[1:23:14] thinking how that he should think as a
[1:23:16] soldier he starts gathering a big army
[1:23:18] for himself to go and defeat this enemy
[1:23:21] which is the normal thing that we would
[1:23:23] try and do in our mind get a big army
[1:23:24] you know so I've got ten thousand we get
[1:23:26] ten thousand preferably twelve thousand
[1:23:28] fifteen
[1:23:29] to beat them well we get better weaponry
[1:23:31] and he's going to meet the Amalekites
[1:23:35] and God says to get in you've got too
[1:23:37] many of these guys so we know the story
[1:23:39] he says that he divides them up he says
[1:23:41] you know on this tide you can all go
[1:23:42] home and then they get some of them
[1:23:44] leave then he gets to the brook and he
[1:23:46] says have the people drink in and have
[1:23:48] some people drink this way keep them if
[1:23:50] they drink this way let them go so from
[1:23:53] his army that you had I don't know the
[1:23:54] exact size that it was before he started
[1:23:55] but he ends up with 300 men after all
[1:23:58] this process is finished get it here's
[1:24:00] Gideon with us 300 men to deliver his
[1:24:02] people from the Amalekites okay so then
[1:24:09] we have the issue of the Midianites
[1:24:11] sorry Midianites and the Amalekites this
[1:24:17] is what they look like and the
[1:24:21] Midianites so Gideon turns up to a hill
[1:24:25] and he looks like looks across to spy
[1:24:27] out let's go and see the enemy and try
[1:24:32] and find their weakness let's get some
[1:24:34] intelligence on these guys okay so they
[1:24:41] look over at this it says in the
[1:24:42] Midianites and the Amalekites and all
[1:24:44] the children of the east lay along in
[1:24:46] the valley like grasshoppers from
[1:24:47] altitude and their camels will without
[1:24:50] number as the sand by the seaside for
[1:24:52] multitude males are going to look at the
[1:24:55] beach and just think if you wanted baby
[1:24:57] piece of sand as a as something that's
[1:25:01] going to attack them because that's what
[1:25:02] it was when they looked at it without
[1:25:04] number they were like the sand of the
[1:25:06] seaside for multitude probably as far as
[1:25:08] they could see with people and camels
[1:25:13] and horses and tents sometimes in our
[1:25:19] life we come up against this sort of
[1:25:20] stuff where it seems impossible where
[1:25:25] our enemies they like the sand upon the
[1:25:27] seashore that what's come against us is
[1:25:29] like the sand upon the seashore I want
[1:25:33] to show you sometimes rather Bram sees
[1:25:35] some of the things God does sometimes
[1:25:37] look ridiculous and another word will be
[1:25:40] pathetic like it it just looks so
[1:25:42] silly I want to compare these two
[1:25:46] because this is the same chapter
[1:25:48] so here's they look over at the
[1:25:50] Amalekites and the Midianites who were
[1:25:52] like the sand of the seashore for
[1:25:53] multitude and then Gideon's got a plan
[1:25:57] now let's just look at this naturally
[1:25:59] right because I I had to laugh when I
[1:26:02] thought about this in a natural sense so
[1:26:05] his 300 men are lined up you can imagine
[1:26:09] though he's put you're in charge of
[1:26:11] those hundred you're in charge of that
[1:26:12] when I before this he says alright
[1:26:15] Gideon says all right guys here's the
[1:26:16] plan
[1:26:17] we're going to split up into three
[1:26:18] companies and and you can imagine out of
[1:26:28] respect for Gideon they say okay yeah
[1:26:33] let's split up into three okay
[1:26:36] what do you take the center they take
[1:26:39] left leg we take right they're not going
[1:26:42] to say it because they respect Gideon
[1:26:43] but you know they're thinking you know
[1:26:46] if they're honest it's a lot Gideon what
[1:26:48] good is that
[1:26:50] really there's 300 of it look at the
[1:26:52] size of these guys there's 300 it's just
[1:26:55] a together doesn't it's gonna be it
[1:26:58] doesn't matter where we split up we'll
[1:26:59] stay here together
[1:27:00] kiss this and sometimes our response to
[1:27:05] an attack of the enemy sometimes look
[1:27:06] looks can look ridiculous like we might
[1:27:08] have something so strong against us and
[1:27:10] all we do is come up and pray pray for
[1:27:12] me brother
[1:27:13] it looks so pathetic but you know when
[1:27:16] God's in control it's not pathetic it
[1:27:19] was a plan God said split up into three
[1:27:22] companies what you made up the three
[1:27:25] companies so they split Lehman up into
[1:27:27] three companies if you know I would have
[1:27:29] seen them do this sort of just look at
[1:27:32] these guys it's a joke beyond a joke but
[1:27:37] God if God say something he will do it
[1:27:39] it doesn't matter if your if your
[1:27:41] enemies if the thing that's coming
[1:27:43] against yours like the sand upon the
[1:27:44] seashore he will deliver and what the
[1:27:49] plan was was they were all gonna split
[1:27:51] up the three companies around the hills
[1:27:52] one here one here one there and at a
[1:27:54] certain point in time
[1:27:56] they had it they had a torch a lamp in
[1:28:00] their hand a trumpet and they had a
[1:28:02] picture of water and they were going to
[1:28:04] break the picture that picture picture
[1:28:06] the picture and they were gonna blow the
[1:28:07] trumpet and they were going to say the
[1:28:09] sword of the Lord and of Gideon and they
[1:28:14] were going to blow the trumpet that was
[1:28:17] the plan and they stood in three
[1:28:19] companies around the enemy and they did
[1:28:20] that and the enemy just panic they
[1:28:22] didn't know what was going on and they
[1:28:23] they all ended up killing each other and
[1:28:25] just it was chaos these guys all they
[1:28:28] did was blew their trumpet smash the
[1:28:30] picture blew their trumpet the sword of
[1:28:32] the Lord and of Gideon and these guys
[1:28:36] were even so bold that when the
[1:28:38] Midianites and the Amalekites ran they
[1:28:40] pursued them with their 300 minutes
[1:28:43] because they thought they down to about
[1:28:46] 500,000 now think we've got a good
[1:28:48] chance that's what it's like with God if
[1:28:54] your enemies are like the sand of the
[1:28:55] seashore God can still deliver you from
[1:28:57] any situation amen
[1:29:00] this is another one open I can portray
[1:29:03] this across the way that it is in my
[1:29:04] mind it's quite simple but we know the
[1:29:07] story about the wise man that build his
[1:29:09] house upon the sand earth sorry the
[1:29:13] wrong way on the rock it's just seeing
[1:29:15] if you were listening and the foolish
[1:29:17] man built his house upon the sand okay
[1:29:20] and the the the one the wise men that
[1:29:24] built his house upon the sand the rock
[1:29:26] the foolish man upon the sand the waves
[1:29:27] came and the house on the sand because
[1:29:31] it didn't have any foundation that it
[1:29:33] was built on when the water came in it
[1:29:34] just washed all the sand away from
[1:29:35] underneath whose tried to make a sand
[1:29:37] castle at the beach when the tides
[1:29:39] coming in you would have done that when
[1:29:41] we were children you know we we build it
[1:29:43] and then the waves that tide is slowly
[1:29:45] coming and we think we've got a chance
[1:29:47] to keep the sand castle built a like we
[1:29:50] and the leadership and whoever is there
[1:29:53] comes out and he's he starts seeing the
[1:29:55] the sea coming in so he starts telling
[1:29:58] the your all about seven or eight years
[1:30:00] old built here built there we've got to
[1:30:01] build a wall here you know you're trying
[1:30:03] to make yours like that I'm building
[1:30:05] this thing and having my little brothers
[1:30:06] builders happen up but it's a futile
[1:30:08] attempt because there's the tides can
[1:30:10] again it just your sandcastle just gets
[1:30:13] washed away eventually and that's what
[1:30:16] happened to this house because it was
[1:30:17] built on sand when when the water came
[1:30:19] it just washed away and this this house
[1:30:22] fell I want to look into this for a
[1:30:26] little bit
[1:30:29] we know the scripture has used here a
[1:30:31] lot because it's a foundational
[1:30:33] scripture upon our upon how God works
[1:30:38] and deals with men and that's when he
[1:30:41] talked to Peter and said that thou art
[1:30:45] Peter because after Peter said to him
[1:30:47] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:30:48] Living God he said thou art Peter and
[1:30:50] upon this rock I'll build my church now
[1:30:53] we understand and he says in the gates
[1:30:55] of hell shall not prevail against it we
[1:30:57] understand that that what he's saying is
[1:31:01] upon the revelation upon revelation I'll
[1:31:04] build my church
[1:31:05] it's it wasn't pompadour anything we
[1:31:07] understand uh sits upon revelation upon
[1:31:11] revelation that God gives which is
[1:31:13] himself showing to you that Jesus is the
[1:31:17] Christ and all the things he reveals
[1:31:19] okay it's it's now that's we can say
[1:31:23] that's truth because that's God's mind
[1:31:25] and God speaking directly to you truth
[1:31:29] and we can't actually perceive God or
[1:31:36] understand God unless he speaks to us we
[1:31:39] can try and learn God but we can't it's
[1:31:41] impossible to actually know God unless
[1:31:46] he speaks to you that's the way that it
[1:31:48] works unless he reveals himself to us I
[1:31:50] often think of it like a little um who
[1:31:55] knows that and I said maybe a little
[1:31:58] Santa Claus thing but you know the
[1:31:59] little Christmas some snowmen it's like
[1:32:03] a it's like a diamond it's got water in
[1:32:05] it and it's got the snowflakes and maybe
[1:32:07] it's just got a house in there and you
[1:32:08] sort of shake this thing up in there the
[1:32:10] snow these little white things they go
[1:32:12] all around it looks like a nice little
[1:32:14] snow storm in this house and things like
[1:32:17] that I've often thought you know we're
[1:32:21] like one of those except we have painted
[1:32:22] black over the top you know and
[1:32:23] sitting inside that thing no and it's
[1:32:26] sort of all just dark and we we can't do
[1:32:27] anything to perceive anything around us
[1:32:29] and I've often imagined that the
[1:32:31] revelation of God is like was like the
[1:32:34] Lord because he's life and outside of
[1:32:37] zero all this light but we're just
[1:32:38] dwelling in this little dome under all
[1:32:39] this darkness but the Lord just scrapes
[1:32:40] a little piece of that paint off the
[1:32:41] outside and a little bit of light shines
[1:32:44] in hey what's that now before they we
[1:32:48] could have tried to work out what was
[1:32:49] out there as much as we could but we
[1:32:50] would never even know what was out there
[1:32:51] who would never never perceive it
[1:32:53] because we can't we can't it's just the
[1:32:57] way that it is but God's revelation is
[1:32:59] like him scratching some often some
[1:33:00] light comes in and we can suddenly now
[1:33:02] that is what it is that is the light I
[1:33:04] don't have to think this anymore this is
[1:33:06] the light and the more that he scrapes
[1:33:09] off the more like we have in the more it
[1:33:10] just opens up to us and it is that is it
[1:33:12] I'm not making this up that's it it's
[1:33:15] God's revealed it to me
[1:33:16] okay that's revelation now that's what
[1:33:18] brother Graham says I've got a quote he
[1:33:21] sees what do they what do they say this
[1:33:24] today this is about revelation about
[1:33:26] revelation polished up suicide mental
[1:33:29] telepathy fortune-telling just exactly
[1:33:31] the same not worth enough real gospel
[1:33:33] sound teaching in their hearts and
[1:33:34] spiritual revelation because the entire
[1:33:36] Church of the Living God is built upon
[1:33:39] spiritual spiritual revealed truth from
[1:33:41] heaven that's the thing the church not
[1:33:43] built upon teachings not built upon
[1:33:44] theologies it's not built upon
[1:33:46] denominations but it's built upon this
[1:33:48] revelation of Jesus Christ to you that's
[1:33:54] what it's built on okay now that's
[1:33:55] that's the rock that we're talking about
[1:33:57] we're not talking about that's and
[1:34:00] that's the Jesus that we're talking
[1:34:01] about we're not talking about the Jesus
[1:34:04] someone else will present saying this is
[1:34:05] Jesus we're talking about the Jesus
[1:34:08] coming to you and there's a big
[1:34:09] difference okay now this is why brother
[1:34:14] Graham said to me everything that
[1:34:16] operates must come out of this Bible or
[1:34:18] it's not right now everyone will agree
[1:34:19] with that all Christians will agree with
[1:34:21] that right but but you've got to go on a
[1:34:22] bit further he says it has to come from
[1:34:25] here it can be proved in the Bible not
[1:34:27] just one place not just one place but it
[1:34:31] has to come all the way through the
[1:34:33] Bible I have to believe it it has to
[1:34:36] dovetail and tied together with
[1:34:37] every scripture or I don't believe it
[1:34:39] and then because Paul said if any angel
[1:34:41] if an angel from heaven come preaching
[1:34:42] any other gospel needn't be a curse so I
[1:34:44] believe the Bible now when you're
[1:34:48] talking about a rock what are you saying
[1:34:50] is efforts of the rock you're talking
[1:34:52] about then if if I look at this rock on
[1:34:56] that side I'm gonna say oh the rock is
[1:34:58] that now if later on I see it from the
[1:34:59] other side it's the same rock I'm seeing
[1:35:02] the same thing if I look inside the rock
[1:35:04] it's the same rock
[1:35:06] that's why brother Bram saying it's got
[1:35:09] to it's got to be all the way through
[1:35:10] I've got a sense this is the rock that
[1:35:12] I've found that this this thing that
[1:35:16] I've heard yes Rock because it lines up
[1:35:18] but with all the rest of the rock in
[1:35:20] there you understand what I mean it's
[1:35:22] not just an isolated thing on its own
[1:35:24] right it's the rock it's Revelation have
[1:35:28] I got this so then we come to the idea
[1:35:30] of rock and sand right when you think
[1:35:36] about this you think about little pieces
[1:35:38] of sand they're basically in a spiritual
[1:35:41] sense it basically just thousands of a
[1:35:44] collections of little ideas just little
[1:35:48] ideas that this idea that idea they
[1:35:49] don't do this one this one this one this
[1:35:50] one this one this one and there's
[1:35:52] billions of them out there and they just
[1:35:53] the ideas and the thing about these
[1:35:57] man's ideas and all these things are
[1:35:59] they don't have any connection to
[1:36:01] anything else is just a random idea on
[1:36:02] their own just a random idea on its own
[1:36:05] and you just get a whole lot of these
[1:36:06] just a random collection of ideas on
[1:36:08] their own it's all that it's all the
[1:36:10] stuffers as opposed to the rock it's one
[1:36:14] idea that's constant all the way through
[1:36:15] doesn't matter from here here people
[1:36:17] that say God has changed no oh he's got
[1:36:21] a new idea
[1:36:22] no no that's and you're talking about
[1:36:23] cuz because God is the same rock it's
[1:36:26] the same thing that's why Paul said I
[1:36:28] can't preach this because back here we
[1:36:30] talked about this I'm gonna preach about
[1:36:32] the rock you know I'm gonna send in
[1:36:33] brother Brown comes along and sees I
[1:36:34] can't change it it's all the way through
[1:36:36] it's the rock okay it's my father heard
[1:36:40] someone had talked to him that has been
[1:36:44] in Bible College and he said it was very
[1:36:46] confusing in the area see because one
[1:36:48] week someone will come along and say
[1:36:49] something and then the next week some
[1:36:51] come along and say something very
[1:36:52] different and then the next week they
[1:36:53] say something very different now these
[1:36:56] men that went there and this is modern
[1:36:58] thinking they thought it was intelligent
[1:36:59] to give the people this and give them
[1:37:02] that and give them that and give them
[1:37:03] all these things and let them make up
[1:37:04] their own mind about it you know in
[1:37:08] other words just give them a whole lot
[1:37:09] of sand and let them build their life on
[1:37:10] that right now
[1:37:11] now that's okay that thinking is okay
[1:37:14] when life is going good that'll work
[1:37:16] having all these different scattering of
[1:37:19] ideas in your mind and listen that maybe
[1:37:21] it's just maybe it's that maybe it's
[1:37:22] that even within a Christian sense that
[1:37:24] that'll be okay when there's no storm
[1:37:26] okay but you let a storm come in your
[1:37:30] life where the unseen comes and hits
[1:37:32] your life and it pounds at you and it
[1:37:36] pounds and pounds and you don't
[1:37:37] understand why you don't understand
[1:37:39] what's going on and things get hard and
[1:37:41] tough and you shakin around it's then
[1:37:46] that those ideas won't hold they they
[1:37:51] mean nothing when when the hardship of
[1:37:55] life comes and they mean nothing but
[1:37:57] when you're on a rock and the storms of
[1:38:00] life come and they hit you you can say
[1:38:04] Jesus never fails all things work
[1:38:07] together for good to those that love God
[1:38:08] you've got this rock and now you're
[1:38:11] being beaten and pounded but you can
[1:38:12] hold it'll hold things are happening you
[1:38:15] just don't know why was this going this
[1:38:17] way it's gonna hold you've got something
[1:38:20] in there now and the good times you're
[1:38:22] gonna be made fun of look at this guy
[1:38:23] you know but us when the storms of life
[1:38:26] hit that you want to be on this rock
[1:38:29] here rather than these intelligent ideas
[1:38:33] of sand you know all this random
[1:38:36] collection of ideas that really when you
[1:38:38] want to push a storm against that it
[1:38:39] won't hold that won't hold but I'll give
[1:38:42] you another principle here right you can
[1:38:44] liken it to lies and truth and this is a
[1:38:45] very interesting concept about about a
[1:38:50] lie and a truth
[1:38:51] Sanders like lies right let's go through
[1:38:56] the next one
[1:38:57] now the Bible says Jesus said of Satan
[1:39:00] you're a liar and you're the father of
[1:39:02] it you're just a liar but God is truth
[1:39:05] his word is a rock and that's where the
[1:39:08] scripture says is one Lord one faith one
[1:39:09] baptism there's just one thing and it's
[1:39:11] true it's not going to change it's the
[1:39:14] same thing all the way through right
[1:39:16] lies this is my final point on this how
[1:39:21] many lies by his here's a question what
[1:39:25] does 1 plus 1 equal okay how many truths
[1:39:30] can you give to that one right that's
[1:39:34] the answers to how many lies can you
[1:39:37] answer that with written down a few
[1:39:42] numbers here but you could answer it you
[1:39:44] could give as many Liars to that
[1:39:46] equation is what there are sand upon the
[1:39:48] seashore lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
[1:39:50] because there's many as there are as
[1:39:52] meaning numbers you can say this admits
[1:39:54] the answer team the answers 12 the
[1:39:55] answers this the answers it you can give
[1:39:58] us many lies on a on a honest question
[1:40:02] but you can only give one truth see God
[1:40:05] didn't design this stuff just
[1:40:07] willy-nilly he's showing us to say look
[1:40:10] Satan is going to throw out all these
[1:40:12] lies lies lies omit like the sand upon
[1:40:14] the sea don't build your life upon that
[1:40:16] because the he can have a million lives
[1:40:18] for one one question but there is one
[1:40:21] truth his only one is only one truth it
[1:40:24] can't be that's why other religions
[1:40:26] can't dwell with Christianity castaño
[1:40:28] there's only one truth is only one Rock
[1:40:31] so I'm glad that we can look at what we
[1:40:35] believe look what we follow and we can
[1:40:37] see it go through the whole Bible and we
[1:40:39] can perceive I've found the rock this is
[1:40:43] the rock Paul when he preached he'd
[1:40:46] found the rock when I was I when they
[1:40:48] talked that was the rock Moses he found
[1:40:50] the rock we perceive this is the rock
[1:40:52] and how you sometimes get given ideas
[1:40:55] you hear them and you think something's
[1:40:57] not quite right about that probably
[1:40:59] because it's sand just put it back out
[1:41:02] in the beach don't build on that you're
[1:41:05] talking about the rock I've got two more
[1:41:08] now this is the Gospel according to
[1:41:10] Isaac this is just
[1:41:12] this is something I've looked into it
[1:41:15] it's that I'm not saying that's it is
[1:41:18] what it is but it doesn't matter if it
[1:41:19] is or it isn't so don't think that oh
[1:41:22] he's got this great revelation I just
[1:41:23] thought this was nice but it's so this
[1:41:26] might disclaimer before I read it to you
[1:41:29] because I don't usually do these sorts
[1:41:31] of things but that's just I just found
[1:41:32] this very interesting and I enjoyed this
[1:41:33] analogy for myself
[1:41:36] the outcome is correct so it doesn't
[1:41:37] matter but Jeremiah says fear ye not me
[1:41:41] saith the Lord
[1:41:42] will you not tremble at my presence
[1:41:43] which have placed the sand for the bound
[1:41:46] of the sea by a perpetual decree that it
[1:41:48] cannot pass it and though the waves
[1:41:50] thereof toss themselves yet can they not
[1:41:53] prevail they they roar yet they cannot
[1:41:56] pass over it
[1:41:57] God said I place the sand here and
[1:42:00] regardless of how much the waves roar
[1:42:04] and they beat and they try and come in
[1:42:08] waves you will not pass the sand and he
[1:42:13] said I have set the said as a bound for
[1:42:16] the sea by perpetual decree I don't
[1:42:21] understand what they were perpetual
[1:42:22] means so I demand won't either
[1:42:24] Hey perpetual it means never ceasing
[1:42:30] continuing forever a future time
[1:42:32] destined to be eternal perpetual so if
[1:42:36] he says perpetual decree that means I'm
[1:42:39] going to make this decree and it's going
[1:42:40] to last forever it's a perpetual decree
[1:42:43] sand you'll hold back the sea as long as
[1:42:47] you're there you'll hold back the sea
[1:42:49] period you're a perpetual decree okay so
[1:42:54] this is the Gospel according to Isaac
[1:42:56] don't forget I don't mean that in a
[1:42:57] light-hearted way that I just mean that
[1:43:00] because I don't usually do this so now
[1:43:03] we've got John in the book of Revelation
[1:43:05] and John John we know is a type of the
[1:43:10] bride and I read unto this well that's
[1:43:12] very interesting
[1:43:13] so John the Lord shown John many things
[1:43:16] I mean and then it says Johnny ends up
[1:43:18] sitting up standing on the sand of the
[1:43:20] seashore and he looks out over the sea
[1:43:22] and he sees a he sees a beast coming
[1:43:25] the the see now we know what that that
[1:43:27] beast does okay that's that's the
[1:43:30] Antichrist coming out okay and then
[1:43:33] later on it's it's easy essentially he
[1:43:35] turns around and he sees a he sees to
[1:43:38] another piece coming out of the land but
[1:43:40] I sort of in my little mind I thought
[1:43:43] that's kind of nice that Jonah's in a
[1:43:47] place where he's on the sand where God
[1:43:49] said send as a perpetual decree these
[1:43:52] waves let's see is never ever going to
[1:43:54] come to where you are it'll never pass
[1:43:55] you so here's this piece coming out of
[1:43:58] the sea but you know John's in a spot
[1:44:00] where this the sea is never going to be
[1:44:02] able to overtake him and I think that's
[1:44:03] the same with the bride this we're in a
[1:44:07] place where as much as this beast comes
[1:44:08] out and tries to throw everything
[1:44:10] accounted us there's a perpetual decree
[1:44:11] saying you'll not pass the bride is in a
[1:44:14] place where you're not pass you're not
[1:44:16] you'll never overcome it you you'll
[1:44:18] never go past my bounds which is I've
[1:44:20] sent the sand for abound John you stand
[1:44:22] there you'll never pass it and then he
[1:44:24] turns around he sees the the another
[1:44:26] piece coming out of the sea but then I
[1:44:28] had another scripture for that because
[1:44:30] afterwards the Lord comes down the
[1:44:32] mighty angel he stands upon the sea
[1:44:34] probably and he's mentioned this a few
[1:44:35] times and he stands upon the land some
[1:44:38] more but we're nicely pinched on the
[1:44:41] sand now this is just the Gospel
[1:44:44] according to Isaac but I thought it was
[1:44:45] an interesting it's truth nonetheless
[1:44:48] because this beast will never get never
[1:44:51] overcome us and God gets rid of all of
[1:44:54] those but not us the last one that I've
[1:44:57] got I've got a very interesting um some
[1:45:01] interesting quotes from brother Brennan
[1:45:02] here this is jumping into a sermon
[1:45:10] and he looked to them and said verily I
[1:45:12] say unto you if thou shalt say to this
[1:45:15] mountain be moved and cast into the sea
[1:45:17] and don't doubt in your heart this is
[1:45:22] important point now and the original it
[1:45:24] says this and the lexicon Greek lexicon
[1:45:26] quickly it's gone it says if you should
[1:45:29] say to this mountain be ye lifted up and
[1:45:32] thrown into the sea and don't doubt in
[1:45:34] your heart but believe that it is being
[1:45:38] done you shall have what you say we are
[1:45:42] looking for things so spontaneous but
[1:45:44] what did he mean you look at that at the
[1:45:46] mountain and say be thou lifted up and
[1:45:48] thrown into the sea and then and then in
[1:45:52] your heart believe that what you have
[1:45:55] said is taking place okay who's got
[1:46:01] mountains in their life that they're
[1:46:03] dealing with at the moment we all have
[1:46:05] mountains in our life some of these
[1:46:07] things look like it is actually
[1:46:10] impossible for this thing to move
[1:46:12] sometimes it just gets to a point where
[1:46:14] maybe it's been here for so long we just
[1:46:16] get weary we think I don't know how this
[1:46:18] thing I've prayed against this thing for
[1:46:21] so many times and it just seems to me
[1:46:22] like it stays there it might be a it
[1:46:25] might be a relationship issue it might
[1:46:29] be a health issue in your life that
[1:46:30] you've got there might be a financial
[1:46:32] issue it might just be might just be
[1:46:35] something in you that that just always
[1:46:36] happens a certain way and you don't like
[1:46:38] it but you've tried so hard to not be
[1:46:39] like that maybe a something in your
[1:46:41] character that that's just you look back
[1:46:43] from father to grandfather you just see
[1:46:45] it all the way through and you think
[1:46:46] I've just got that and you just can't
[1:46:47] seem to shake it you can't seem to break
[1:46:49] it you know and and we can sometimes
[1:46:52] maybe in a convention or at a time of
[1:46:55] the Spirit move and we get so encouraged
[1:46:57] then we go out for a prayer and we know
[1:47:00] it does happen this way but I'm saying
[1:47:01] we get encouraged it and we we go for
[1:47:04] deliverance and we saw enthusiastic
[1:47:07] about it but yet the next day or the
[1:47:09] week later it seems like it's still
[1:47:11] there and and we can get discouraged
[1:47:16] brother Graham said here we're looking
[1:47:18] for things so spontaneous so spontaneous
[1:47:21] he said but what did he mean
[1:47:24] he's saying hang on Jesus didn't he
[1:47:26] didn't actually say that if you look in
[1:47:27] Twitty cd2 makes you say that we look at
[1:47:29] it as like when I go up it's all just
[1:47:30] gonna happen those mountains going to
[1:47:32] disappear sometimes it does but he's
[1:47:36] saying one of the problems are it's he
[1:47:38] didn't actually say it like that
[1:47:40] he said if you pray you say to this
[1:47:45] mountain wherever the mountain is in
[1:47:46] your life you can all do this this will
[1:47:48] help you and your faith to overcome that
[1:47:50] mountain if you say mountain be removed
[1:47:53] and be cast into the sea be removed and
[1:47:56] be cast into the sea and then in your
[1:47:59] heart believe that what you have said is
[1:48:01] is taking place what a brother Graham
[1:48:05] say maybe just one little grain of sand
[1:48:09] begin to move through the whole mountain
[1:48:13] little grain of sand rolled off the
[1:48:17] mountain
[1:48:18] now Satan's going to come along same to
[1:48:21] look how big the mountain there's one
[1:48:22] little grain of sand from you can say
[1:48:25] hang on hang on hang on so you're saying
[1:48:30] one grain of sand moves across the map
[1:48:32] moved off the mountain because you got
[1:48:33] to better get some tactics like you're a
[1:48:35] lawyer
[1:48:36] are you saying one grain of sand moved
[1:48:37] well it was only one no was it one or
[1:48:40] nothing it was one was one was it uh-huh
[1:48:45] so you're acknowledging that mountains
[1:48:48] moving is that what you're saying the
[1:48:51] mountains moving
[1:48:52] buts not moving very much no it's either
[1:48:55] moving or not moving is it moving it'll
[1:49:00] give you faith the mountains moving it's
[1:49:02] moving even if it's just one grain of
[1:49:05] sand every prayer makes it move hold on
[1:49:08] it's just moving you see as you might
[1:49:11] not be able to notice it but there's
[1:49:12] something in your heart to say that's
[1:49:13] being done next there might be two more
[1:49:15] grains three grains but that mountain is
[1:49:17] moving you should love what you say
[1:49:20] that's the faith many of us prayed for
[1:49:23] at night the next one say well there's
[1:49:25] no difference on it feeling different
[1:49:26] that's where we're failing that doesn't
[1:49:28] have to show one thing but if thou
[1:49:29] believest in your heart that what you
[1:49:31] say is being done you shall have what
[1:49:33] you say that's it if you believe that
[1:49:34] what you say is already taking place
[1:49:37] I don't have to feel like I'll see it I
[1:49:38] believe it this is the reason that it
[1:49:39] takes place that's just happening one
[1:49:42] grain of sand is moving but it's moving
[1:49:44] I've got brother belt like this analogy
[1:49:45] so I've got one more of the same quote
[1:49:47] just in a different meeting right
[1:49:49] because I just like it no matter what
[1:49:50] the circumstance Jesus said to mark
[1:49:52] 11:24 he said if thou shalt say to this
[1:49:55] mountain be plucked up and cast into the
[1:49:56] sea and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:49:58] believe what you say shall come to pass
[1:50:00] they all shall have what you say now let
[1:50:02] me quote the lexicon that's the original
[1:50:04] brick here's what reads thou shalt say
[1:50:06] to this mountain be lifted up and thrown
[1:50:08] into the sea and don't doubt in your
[1:50:10] heart but believe that what you have
[1:50:12] seen is coming is coming to pass you can
[1:50:14] have what you see when you see it
[1:50:17] mountain be moved and it still stands
[1:50:18] there you say well it didn't happen
[1:50:20] that's what we say
[1:50:22] can't see much you just didn't see that
[1:50:24] one grain of sand move that's all it
[1:50:26] happened you didn't actually perceive
[1:50:27] that oh it did happen it did happen when
[1:50:32] you see a mountain move maybe one little
[1:50:35] nothing he meant here insignificant
[1:50:36] grain of sand turn loose out of the
[1:50:38] hundreds of billions and billions of
[1:50:41] tons of sand one little grain moved one
[1:50:44] little grain moved but it's begin to
[1:50:47] take place hold that faith and watch
[1:50:49] that mountain disappear if you say to
[1:50:53] this mountain be thou removed to be cast
[1:50:55] into the sea and don't doubt but believe
[1:50:57] what you have said is coming to pass
[1:50:59] that mountain will disappear
[1:51:01] that's the truth of it who's headed in
[1:51:04] their life where if something has been
[1:51:06] so hard and you've prayed and then
[1:51:07] you've kind of forgotten about it then
[1:51:09] maybe you look back years later you
[1:51:10] think that things go on that mountain is
[1:51:13] gone every mountain you face is the same
[1:51:16] if you say to it be removed one grain at
[1:51:20] a time the end of the quote certainly
[1:51:25] the I should say and I heart disease
[1:51:27] moved from my child disease move from my
[1:51:29] body in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[1:51:30] don't yeah right there the good germs
[1:51:32] take on a new armor and a new weapon and
[1:51:34] the enemy begins to back up he's
[1:51:37] defeated because Christ and the drinking
[1:51:38] of his mirror Calvary defeated the devil
[1:51:40] every one of his powers and he stripped
[1:51:43] on him everything he had and it's
[1:51:44] nothing but a bluff you can go through
[1:51:45] with it he will do it if you say to this
[1:51:48] mountain don't forget if it's just one
[1:51:51] little grain of sand every time you pray
[1:51:53] every time you believe it's more grains
[1:51:55] of sand that mountain will be moved so
[1:52:01] next time you're at the beach or back in
[1:52:04] South Africa and the desert or wherever
[1:52:05] and you cease and you can ponder on
[1:52:08] these things ponder justly you can pick
[1:52:11] up a little grain of sand and think you
[1:52:12] know what you can think of God you can
[1:52:16] think of how great he is and how it was
[1:52:17] deliverance of his hand of of all these
[1:52:21] different things such a small little
[1:52:23] thing and yet God I think when he
[1:52:24] designed it he thought I'm gonna make
[1:52:26] this little this little tiny thing and
[1:52:28] just scattered along the beach and all
[1:52:29] I'll talk about it now and then
[1:52:32] praise the Lord let's um let's just um
[1:52:35] we'll stand this morning and we'll pray
[1:52:42] and then I want to sing um or the anteed
[1:52:45] way of your guitar here okay sit up well
[1:52:49] pray and then I think we will sing um on
[1:52:51] Christ the solid rock I stand all other
[1:52:54] ground is sinking sand Emma let's just
[1:52:57] pray this morning Lord Jesus Lord we are

[1:53:07] grateful for your word we're so grateful
[1:53:09] for your promises and our life we're so
[1:53:14] grateful for your strength Lord and if
[1:53:16] there are people here Lord that are
[1:53:18] still struggling on their own Lord in
[1:53:21] terms of they haven't fully decided to
[1:53:24] let go and let you take full control of
[1:53:25] their life floor to pray that they would
[1:53:27] you'd probably M to do that Lord because
[1:53:30] resting and your strength is such an
[1:53:32] amazing thing Lord to realize that we
[1:53:36] don't have to do this all we have to do
[1:53:38] is come to you Lord and let the life of
[1:53:41] Jesus Christ live out through isolative
[1:53:43] you all of our strength and love the
[1:53:45] life that Paul said it's no longer I

[1:53:51] fountain of strength you're the fountain
[1:53:52] of life for the fountain of joy and Lord
[1:53:57] we just say Lord I'm so grateful I
[1:53:59] believe he's right here as Lord for your
[1:54:01] your revelation to us that you've
[1:54:03] revealed the truth to us that we can
[1:54:05] we're not following coming we devised
[1:54:07] fables we don't have to work hard to
[1:54:09] make it all work together with
[1:54:11] everything else but it's it's all
[1:54:12] through the Scriptures our saw plane we
[1:54:14] can see we can see your word we can see
[1:54:16] your truth we can see your hand all the
[1:54:18] way through the scriptures we can look
[1:54:20] back and think if I was with Isaiah I
[1:54:21] would enjoy his company files with Moses
[1:54:24] I would enjoy his company in his
[1:54:25] fellowship I would enjoy what he has to
[1:54:26] say if I was with the Ezekiel if I was
[1:54:30] worth
[1:54:31] Nehemiah all of these different ones if
[1:54:33] I was with Paul if I was with John
[1:54:34] Bosworth Martin Luther I would
[1:54:36] appreciate enjoy the fellowship because
[1:54:38] we we've been revealed the same truth
[1:54:41] the same rock we're just thinking Lord
[1:54:44] that we can build our life upon you I
[1:54:46] pray continue to bless us this week as
[1:54:48] we go out may we be faithful Lord may we
[1:54:53] be found faithful just doing what you
[1:54:55] want us to do may we be victorious in
[1:54:57] our walk may our prayer lives to be
[1:54:59] strong and and that we can overcome
[1:55:01] every circumstance by faith and may you
[1:55:04] encourage your hearts toward those of us
[1:55:06] that have mountains in our life that we
[1:55:07] are facing will maybe take courage that
[1:55:10] one grain at a time the mountains moving
[1:55:12] Lord and that just to hold on and
[1:55:15] believe that it is coming to pass so we
