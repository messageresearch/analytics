help someone Lord or we just thank him we pray in the name of Jesus Amen the bishop brothers and sisters um by the being actually preached my sermon exactly this morning which was amazing but um it just goes to show you know the Lord moves in the channel so we're grateful for that um okay we're just telling our Bibles to uh second Peter one verse 4. 4 I mean um I just want to speak this afternoon on um the Believers promises uh we we have you know the law has given us the Bible and it's full of promises and I believe it's absolutely relevant to us in this day and age and um it's it's there for us to walk be able to walk a Victoria's life and know where we are in this life um all right second Peter 1 verse four whereby are given unto a succeeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and then just if we can tune to Hebrews 11 33 . uh we'll start with verse 32. and what more shall and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell if Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and devta and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their date the life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a bit of Resurrection I mean you can have your seats and uh like we can see with each of these Believers that was just mentioned they they all had a promise to them that they um the lord gave them to inherit and they all had Giants in their life that they had to overcome and you know every blessing that there is there's probably an amalekite or some enemy sitting there guarding it and with and but the Lord has said that he's given it to us and we are well able to take it um and Deuteronomy 7 verse 1 it says it's um the account of uh of the Lord commanding Israel to take the promised land it says when the Lord thy God God shall bring thee into the land whether thou goes to possess it and hath cast out many nations before the the Hittites and the gurga sites and the amorites and the Canaanites and the perizzites and the highlights and the jebusites Seven Nations greater and mightier than now and when the Lord thy God shall live with him before thee Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them they also make no Covenant with him nor show Mercy unto them and what I find amazing and that is the Bible says those nations are great they're mightier than you are um and I'm sure we've all come to a place in our lives where you come up against something and and you realize Lord if it's if you don't help me this is a hopeless case you've I need you and um and and and the Lord says he shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them and make no government with them we're not here to negotiate with the devil um as places under our feet and that's a period we we don't have to settle for for second best or or slightly substandard he's completely defeated um and uh and I'm so thankful you know greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world and he's already overcome the world um uh David says in the book of Samuel uh he said I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until I had consumed them and I I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yay they have fallen under my feet so as it's given to us to pursue them and to destroy them until we have consumed them we don't have to we don't we can we can we can take everything that's in our promised land for us the law is given to us can we just alternate the second Samuel verse 2. chapter 2 verse 22. I'm not going to say anything new this afternoon but I believe it's very applicable anyway so David says for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God I have leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him but who is God save the Lord or who is a rock Save Our God it is God that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hein's feet and seatth me upon my high places he teacheth My Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is broken by mine arms there was also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand can we just put it up on the screen please that was also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand eth holding me up and thy gentleness hath made me great thou Hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip I have pursued my enemies and overtake them neither did I turn again till they were consumed I have wounded them that well they were not able to rise they have fallen under my feet for thou as good at me with strength unto the battle they also says subdued unto me those that rose up against me thou hath also given the next of my enemies that I might destroy them that hate me they cried but there was none to save them even unto the Lord but he answered them not then I debate them small as a dust before the wind I did cast him out as the dirt as dirt in the streets and uh I mean in this day and age we're not we're not killing Philistines and and physical people but it's um you know I believe as those strongholds in our lives or just just moving forward on the Lord having a deeper experience with them and um we can we can count them as dust under our feet and um I just want to speak about some of the promises that the Lord has given the believer in this day and age um has been through all ages but but for us today and um you know the word contains a lot of promises but I believe the word itself is also a promise um to us in Matthew 4 of us verse 4 it says sorry there's going to be a lot of reading or verses um I'm just reading basically repeating promises but he answered and said it was written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and you know there's there's several places in the Bible it says there's three or four times that the heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not fail Psalms 119 says Thy word as a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and uh I think it was actually on one of the slides this morning by the Burnham says you know the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any conditions and may the Lord just make that real to us and help us to reach out and grab a hold of that and no matter what we Face the word of God as our victory Hebrews 4 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing either to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart can you please put up that quote Oneness um we all can see that for I believe that's the way we should do always weigh things with the word because the word is the only thing that will be able to remain Jesus said both Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away that's why I believe it and to believe it and believe it to be God's program I believe that that is the finished work of God wrote out in the word therefore that if anything would be contrary to that word it could not be God or God's plan I believe it's the program now the spirit of God and the word makes the word live itself act itself out it brings the word to life like a seed and you know sometimes in this junior of life we may get to a place where we think Lord why did this happen to me or why did you allow a certain thing in my life um wouldn't it have been better if it just wasn't then I didn't have to deal with in the first place um but I believe there's absolutely a purpose and a reason behind it and even if we can't see it right now or in the trial there will come a point once you're through it you can look back and you you can look at it and you can see why and um and you know the Bible says all things that work together for good to them that love God so whatever whatever the outcome is uh whatever you go through the outcome is is for your good yeah and and the thing is if we if we didn't struggle with certain things if there wasn't hard things in our lives how would we learn to overcome and how would we ever get closer to God they have to be there and they're there for us to overcome not to not to be defeated under Proverbs 3 verse 5 says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding so Lord help us just to put our thinking on a situation out of the out of the picture and trust in him and he will bring us through um one thing that's been made real to me recently and it was actually an exhortation given on Wednesday here um and and one thing that was said is he will navigate us through every obstacle every Iceberg he will do it and to fear not and you know it made me realize that um you know no matter what we go through the Lord's intimately aware of it he's he's he's intimately interested and aware of what you go through even if it doesn't feel feel like it sometimes and Jeremiah 29 it says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end we're moving towards an expected end and each one of our Lives I believe that and uh something which spoke to my heart recently was in in Psalms it says the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the work of thine own hands in his time he will perfect that which concerneth you yeah and like Ben said this morning we are the workmanship of the lord we we are we are that Clay on his will and he knows how much how much we can take what we need to you know to be made in the vessel that he wants us to be and I just want to and and the thing is like being said this morning how do we possess those promises um what's the key and and the key is faith the Bible says we walk by faith not by sight and uh in Hebrews 11 where it talks about all those Believers how through faith that overcame um it says through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past aged because she judged him faithful who had promised she may have stumbled at the beginning but the law brought her through and she she came to that place where she believed and a little bit further it says by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drowned those Egyptians in your life by faith they will be drowned and by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days and as we read in the beginning that same verse um all these all these Believers through faith subdued kingdoms and righteousness obtain promises and stop the mouths of lions Queens the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed the Valiant in a fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens okay we put that second quote on there please um yeah he's ready to take that man dying with cancer that with the heart that was the heart trouble that that's blind that one's Afflicted if you'll just place his faith in there turn him around from Death unto life start him off with a testimony he's waiting to do it he puts you right in the Trap to see what you do he put them right down in that trap there looked like nature itself was hiding its face that was when um if you read a little bit further that was when the children of Israel was between the Red Sea and Pharaoh's Army um it looked like nature itself was hiding its face yes one writer said one time when they got in that place wondered what Moses would do had one command go forward if you're in the line of duty no matter what stays in the way the greatest experiences I've had is to come up against something I couldn't get over it or under it and just stand there and watch God make a way through it that's the way to do it just move keep moving press your nose against it just keep moving on just keep going on God Will Make A Way yeah I believe that I just want to um play uh a bit of a section of brother Branham um yeah if you guys can put it up with the audio please and uh the mind that the mind that was in Christ is that what the Bible says you have the words as well the mind that was in Christ be with you what kind of mind is he F stay with the word that's right stay with the word the father's word and defeated the enemy every time now when the enemy attacks and tries to say you got to do this and do that what you go do stay with the word that's right what do you want to do then the word what is the word the Bible say never just read it for the spirit is if God is the word see look here and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit what the spirit that comes in through your mind and enters into you and the sword of that spirit is the word of God Amen what does that Spirit fight with why is the holy spirit fight with Sensations feelings the word Hallelujah the spirit of God walks right up to the devil and said it is written hey hey man it is written Hallelujah the devil gives away what do we do take the sword which is the word of God put amen with what a hand of Faith yes the strong hand of Faith the two-age sword the Bible said Hebrews 4 it's a two-age sword Cuts both coming and going brother what does it do take the word take the spirit let the Spirit come into your heart open up your mind say Thy word is truth now you do this sister Thy word is truth Lord I ain't going to pay attention how I feel what anybody self says I'm stopping up I'm blowing out every one of my Avenues all the frustrations and doubts and unbeliefs that have ever had ever feel he ever had all the sickness ever had everything else ever had I'm blowing them all out I'm bypassing all that I'm coming right straight to my spirit hold on come down you said you made me a free moral agent you are my son all right I open up my heart in my mind come in Lord Jesus and grab the faith that sword of the spirit thus saith the Lord scream Hallelujah amen then cut out every enemy in front of you know there it is n't it if a whole spooky Spirit made you feel all cut that thing away with the word of God our strength is a joy of the Lord is my strength [Music] whether it be the enemy whether it be sickness worthy disease whatever it is take that word and pull it with the sword and if you fight for the first time they don't seem to move Whack It Again whack it again and whack it until you check your hole through like a little chicken beating itself out of an eagle what you are that's a soldier that's the soldier of the cross yes sir knock every enemy out Hallelujah we are predestinated royal seat of Abraham [Music] when Abraham denied everything that was against God's word he chopped his way right through ever obstacle to come in front of him yeah this is not the right place I'll stay right there get off of my grounds lock said you better come on down here we're having a good time down here we all got an organization down here while my wife's ahead of the literary society and everything else in the city I'll tell you where to come down here Sarah said Abraham shut up Sarah Hallelujah stand right here this is where God placed me right Church where I stand amen yeah amen Lord help us to whack it and whack it and whack it again and it's not your whacking that helps it's you know it's like their policeman you know he's got no physical power to stop that those trucks and cars but um you know the law that empowers him is where the power lies and we can serve notice on the devil and uh just in closing I just want to say um what is your Mountain what's your giant you know the the enemy might be trying to make you worry and doubt and fear in a certain situation in your life and uh I'm just going to repeat some promises regarding that in Hebrews the Lord says he will never leave you nor forsake you in Romans it says all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose and Romans that says we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and if we feel insufficient ourselves to do it which we are the Bible says he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no Mighty increases strength and maybe maybe we don't understand certain situations the Lord has allowed in our lives but in Prophecy says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to their own understanding put your understanding away and trust in him Isaiah says for as their Heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and Samuel it says as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord has tried he is a buckler to all them that trust him Ecclesiastes and says he that he hath made everything beautiful in his time and uh this is my prayer Lord and and Philippians says and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus and uh I believe every believer has access to the Lord no matter how young or how old you are in Hebrews it says for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but wasn't all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and Grace to help in times of need and uh and I believe that Satan would try in every way that he can to keep you from from actually believing that and and and making that yours um that's what he does condemns you and um but I mean Peter it says casting all your care about upon him all your cares upon Him for he careth for you and he is our father you know where it says in that um one place in the Bible um you know the Earthly Father the Son asked him will he not give it to him and how much more will our heavenly father and uh brother Branham says when the weakest Christian gets on his knees the Devils tremble and I believe that and just as I close um I just want to say let's let's have a positive confession but brother quidre said once that's not to have a negative confession come over our lips but you know the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God um but faith is also a decision sometimes your mind can't put two and two together sometimes and you struggle to see it but if you decide I'm going to believe it anyway I decide to believe it now regardless of how I feel regardless of what I see regardless of what the situation looks like um I believe eventually it'll drop down to your heart and and and you'll really believe it and uh yeah he's the high priest of our confession so when we pray let's let's give them something to work with let's speak his word back to him and say Lord I take your word I thank you for this Victory I thank you for this thing that I've that I'm asking for and uh and I choose to believe your word concerning my situation rather than what I feel I mean is it possible for us to put the first those um the slides that was up pre-service with the pictures can we put them up I just um they just struck me and I just want to read them again yeah this is the first one pray without seizing and just the next one I don't know you probably all sort I don't know if everyone saw it but um anybody when mountains are moving and things anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but when things don't work out as you hoped that's when that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not amen and then just the next one stay with that word don't never leave the word you stay right with it you stand fast in the Liberty where Christ has made you free be not entangled in all those Yokes of bondage and so forth Stand Fast and stand free God will bless you amen I hope that was the best thing job issue of um by the kiddo if you want to come or yeah God bless you Maria thank you very much for that sermon it's just nice to know that even the weakest believer When you pray to Our Father in heaven we know that he's got our back as brother Dave gets ready to come up we're just gonna sing that song um He Knows My Name indeed [Music] foreign he calls me here though [Music] foreign [Music] he falls [Music] away it will be known [Music] this is [Music] hey I figured all just about heads the heavenly father Lord I Thank you for um dear Lord the space of time that we've had the only father and Lord dear Lord I pray for dear Lord one more blessing dear Lord Jesus Lord that you just come touch each life the heavenly father and Lord each each person we bless the prayer and dear Lord I pray that you just be do you have any father Lord just just be have a great pull on us the heavenly father Lord this afternoon and little Jesus may we just leave here refreshed and the heavenly father Lord just with more of a blessing of you I pray foreign God bless everyone the title I have for today is Thou shalt love the Lord thy God amen our musicians um if we could all turn to our Bibles to Matthew 22 and we'll go to verse 37 so Matthew 22 and verse 37 says and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God before thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets amen amen so I wanna I wanna talk about today I want to talk start with you know what what are the benefits oh your male have your seats amen I mean good thing we had brother Jeremy here you actually got his this man I mean so um what are the benefits of loving those of living those verses I mean well the first benefit that we have is eternal life you know granted eternal life you know this this world is not at home we're just passing through amen but I want to take the example of of Abraham you know the Lord um said to Abraham start walking you know and he told Abraham to you know just start traveling in Abrahams you know started walking and if we turn to um take our Bibles we'll go to Genesis chapter 22. and we'll go to verse 37 oh sorry verse 17. it says here that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy amen that that's a man who walked with the Lord amen his seed will possess the gates of the enemy I mean they all have eternal life amen but I like to end and then I like to look take take Alex look at the Prodigal Son amen he you know his he he went out into the world and we all know what happened to him he lost everything amen so that's what happens when you you don't walk with the Lord I mean and you know I think of myself you know there was once more time I wasn't walking with the Lord wasn't serving the lord and I'm I devil was telling man you need to get a job I was like no Dad I'm hustling you know I'm trying to make money selling cars and stuff and I worked up heaps of money and I got this real nice it wasn't very nice but it was a van and they sold quite a lot of money and then it was Easter and you know day of Celebration I was driving down the road and this old lady fully crashed into me it was completely her fault wrote off my van so you know I lost I lost my van and then just managed to you know get out of get out of my bankruptcy bought a little car and then I was like I went and sold it to someone it's a stodgy guy for not that much money and he didn't take it out of my name so I got all of these feeding fines which weren't mine but like you can't actually take them backside I'm just paying them off I mean but then I want to look here with all thy heart I mean so and and Matthew and Matthew 22 I'm just going to turn back there quickly and verse 37 the Lord says and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart so your your heart I I I searched up heartfelt means deeply and strongly felt sincere I mean your heart is where you make all your choices from now if we go to Genesis 8 and we'll go to verse 21. Genesis 8 21 it says and the Lord smelled a sweet saver and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither again neither will I again Smite any more everything living as I have done amen so the Lord said down his heart amen and we have the fruits of that is that there's never been a greater flood like that amen the Lord kept his word amen even even myself when I was I was in the world I was trying to get you know hatched up being a gang and stuff and then the Lord told me you know if you surrender that I'll fill you with Holy Ghost and that night I made a heartfelt surrender amen I sincerely meant it and and you know the the fruits the fruits of my heart my heart felt surrenders you know I'm I'm not patched up you know I'm not out there doing that evil stuff amen so that's heartfelt you know that's strongly felt and sincere I mean now I want to talk about with all thy Soul amen so your soul is eternal your soul is more like your life amen your entire being that's that's your soul brother Branham says your soul is actually the nature of your spirit amen so everyone has a spirit but you know when you feel the Holy Ghost you get a nature change amen if you were predestinated no matter what you do the predestinated seed in you will germinate and come to life in the right season amen so that's your soul now I want to talk about your mind I mean so it says with all thy mind and that is your thoughts and understanding intellect here's the thing your mind can only think one thought at a time we have the power to choose what thoughts we think if you love the Lord with all thy mind you will think thoughts that the Lord wants you to think I mean and if we go two and two Philippians 4 8 that shows us here the Lord chose on his word what thoughts he wants us to think so Philippians 4 8 it says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things it means that's what the Lord wants us to think upon amen amen I have a quote from Brother Branham he said this is talking about um um Balaam when he tried to go curse as well brother Brown says here the mule had more spiritual discernment than the man when he got his mind off God Amen so you know it's very important we need to you know keep our mind on Lord Jesus think thoughts he wants us I think I mean now I want to go here to um look on our neighbor amen so your neighbor is someone you have an association with amen someone around the world is your neighbor if you move next to him amen so in in a way of saying you know everyone's kind of your neighbor but you know mainly like the people that you associate who impact your life amen if we could go to um Matthew 5 and versus 43 first so Matthew 5 43 it says ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you amen so you pretty much treat everyone the same amen and I have an example of you know what happens when you don't be nice to your neighbors so I used to live up in calcium I was flooding by myself and I was wasn't doing too good and I had I had flatmates which were you know they I live next to them so they had a big impact on my life and I was very mean to them you know I never did the dishes never once ever done I did the dishes I lived there for six months and um and anyways when I left they didn't pay my bond back so you know you have to be nice to your neighbors I mean now I want to talk about no um when it said it said um um it hangs on the law all these hang on hang on the law I want to talk about you know if you love Matthew 22 37 to 39 you won't have anything to worry about amen because that that's that's what the law was there for in those days you know is basically to you know um just to keep you safe and make sure that you got eternal life pretty much if you're a Jew amen and if we could turn to um Leviticus 22 verses 9. and Leviticus 22 verse 9 it says they shall therefore keep mine ordinance lest they bear sin for it and die thereof if they profane it I the Lord do sanctify them amen so that's that's that's pretty much it and you know we the it's the same thing in New Zealand you know we the the law here is to keep us safe and you know I used to always drive dangerously so the consequences was I got heaps of feeding fines and so you need to you know just butterflies like if I always thought you know the police the police here are awesome people you know I want to I just you know want to live a good life I wouldn't have anything to worry about I mean and we go for the for the um what's the profits when he says there and the prophets the prophets would say if you don't do this the Lord will be angry with you I mean if we could go to First Kings and we'll go first Kings 13 to 21 verses 21. so First Kings verses 21 to and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah saying thus saith the Lord for as much as thou Hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and has not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but camest back and has eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the Lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcass shall not come unto the separator of thy father's amen so this was a man who disobeyed no he didn't love the Lord with all his heart all his mind all his soul and this is what happened to him I mean I just want to take some examples from the Bible I want to look at Paul you know he um Paul was loving the wrong Lord and his energy was going into persecuting the right one I mean so Paul in his heart didn't love the Lord although he he he proclaimed that he did amen then on the road to Damascus Lord met him and you know the Lord changed his heart now he then loved the Lord with all his heart mind and soul and Paul is going to heaven amen Paul now his eternal life and if we can go to um Luke 18 verse 18. want to talk here about the Rich Young roller now this was a man who this is an example of someone who didn't want to love the Lord with all their heart mind and soul I mean so Luke 18 verses Luke chapter 18 verses 18 it says and a certain role asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good none is good save one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not be a false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said unto him yet let us thou one thing sell all that thou Hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me now if someone really loved the Lord with all their heart they will do this instantly amen but this and go to verse 23 and when he heard this he was very sorrowful well he was very rich amen and then um there were later recordings of him and he was actually in Hell amen so unfortunately this this man's not going to burn the Lego fire amen so he must love the Lord with all your heart all your mind and all your soul amen amen I trust you're all truly blessed amen forgive you're coming up [Applause] amen
