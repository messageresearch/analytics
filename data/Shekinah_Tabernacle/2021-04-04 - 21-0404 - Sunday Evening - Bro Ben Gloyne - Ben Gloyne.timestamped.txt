[58:44] and um from verse 13.
[58:54] romans 11 13 we're going to read down to
[58:56] verse 24.
[58:58] for i speak to you gentiles and so much
[59:00] as i am the apostle of the gentiles i
[59:02] magnify my own office
[59:04] if by any means i may provoke to
[59:07] emulation them which
[59:08] are my flesh they speak of the jews and
[59:11] might
[59:11] save some of them for if either casting
[59:14] away
[59:15] for sorry for if the casting away of
[59:17] them be the reconciling of the world
[59:20] what shall be the receiving of them but
[59:22] life from the dead
[59:24] for the first fruit be holy the lump is
[59:26] also holy and if the root be holy and so
[59:28] are the branches
[59:30] and if some of the branches be broken
[59:32] off and thou bring a wild
[59:33] olive tree work grafted in among them
[59:36] and with them partakers of the root and
[59:38] the fatness of the olive tree
[59:40] boaster boasts not thyself against the
[59:43] branches but if thou boast thou
[59:45] beareth not the root but the root thee
[59:48] thou will say then the branches were
[59:50] broken off that i might be grafted in
[59:53] well because of unbelief they were
[59:54] broken off and thou standeth by faith
[59:57] be not high-minded but fair for if god
[1:00:00] spared not the natural branches take
[1:00:02] heed least he
[1:00:03] also spare not thee behold therefore the
[1:00:06] goodness
[1:00:07] and severity of god on them which foul
[1:00:10] severity
[1:00:11] but toward thee goodness if thou
[1:00:13] continue in his goodness
[1:00:15] otherwise thou also shall be cut off
[1:00:18] and they also if they abide not not
[1:00:21] still in unbelief shall be grafted
[1:00:23] in for god is able to graft in
[1:00:26] them again for if thou
[1:00:29] wert cut off of the olive tree which is
[1:00:32] well by nature and were graft contrary
[1:00:35] to nature into a good olive tree
[1:00:37] how much more shall these which be the
[1:00:40] natural branches be grafted
[1:00:42] into their own olive tree for i would
[1:00:45] not brethren that ye should be ignorant
[1:00:47] of this mystery
[1:00:48] least ye should by wise in your own
[1:00:51] conceits that the blindness in part
[1:00:53] has happened to israel until the
[1:00:55] fullness of the gentiles
[1:00:57] be coming we're going to read one
[1:00:59] scripture from isaiah 42

[1:01:05] down correctly
[1:01:09] yeah so we're just going to read this
[1:01:10] one verse here isaiah 52 and 14.
[1:01:19] and sorry as many
[1:01:23] were astonished at thee his visage
[1:01:26] was so mad more than any man and his
[1:01:29] form
[1:01:30] more than the sons of men amen let's be
[1:01:34] our heads in a word of prayer
[1:01:36] this afternoon lord jesus
[1:01:39] lord i'm so glad there was a call come
[1:01:41] home
[1:01:42] and by your grace you allowed us to come
[1:01:44] back to you
[1:01:46] lord we just so glad we can lord this
[1:01:50] easter season this resurrection season
[1:01:55] but lord we just want to look into your
[1:01:56] word to look at the
[1:01:58] cause of the resurrection what prices
[1:02:01] were paid lord and
[1:02:03] i just want to ask may this not be some
[1:02:05] intellectual idea
[1:02:06] but may it anchor down into our souls
[1:02:08] lord
[1:02:09] you paid a great price for us lord we
[1:02:12] want to give you glory for it tonight
[1:02:14] lord as we partake of communion and foot
[1:02:16] washing we remember your death till you
[1:02:18] come lord
[1:02:19] we praise your great name we thank you
[1:02:21] we just pray you just anoint speaker and
[1:02:23] hear one more time
[1:02:25] may you personally visit all of our
[1:02:26] hearts lord
[1:02:28] oh may we praise your name lord thank
[1:02:30] you we're built to do so
[1:02:32] we thank you for this opportunity to be
[1:02:33] in your presence once again in jesus
[1:02:35] christ's name
[1:02:36] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[1:02:39] have your
[1:02:40] seats uh this evening i know i'm not
[1:02:43] going to be too long here but
[1:02:45] i want to speak about the price of being
[1:02:46] grafted in
[1:02:49] it was a great price we just read in the
[1:02:52] scripture that he was marred
[1:02:55] more than any man now when something's
[1:02:58] mad it's def
[1:02:59] it's disfigured he was wounded
[1:03:03] for our transgressions bruised for our
[1:03:06] iniquities a chastisement of our
[1:03:08] peace was upon him and by his stripes we
[1:03:10] are healed
[1:03:15] it was a great cost i just i just pray
[1:03:17] this is real because you know
[1:03:19] i never ever want communion foot washing
[1:03:21] to be a ritual
[1:03:22] oh this is this on the calendar we're
[1:03:24] going to go through this motion but or
[1:03:25] easter for that matter or any
[1:03:27] religious holiday that we can't but i
[1:03:29] trust it'll just mean more to us every
[1:03:30] day
[1:03:31] what the lord has done for us his great
[1:03:34] plan of redemption
[1:03:35] even brother brown would say when he
[1:03:37] spoke about christ being the masterpiece
[1:03:40] how
[1:03:40] you know god had his first masterpiece
[1:03:43] in eden with
[1:03:44] with with adam and even but satan
[1:03:46] slipped under the walls of god's word
[1:03:48] and marred that masterpiece
[1:03:50] but god being god cannot be defeated
[1:03:53] and and and and he began to rebuild that
[1:03:55] masterpiece and it was
[1:03:57] it was bigger to manifest and you know
[1:03:59] abraham and different ones until finally
[1:04:01] headed up into jesus christ the
[1:04:02] masterpiece was standing on the earth
[1:04:04] but that was only the first part of the
[1:04:06] masterpiece there had to be
[1:04:08] a second part of that masterpiece which
[1:04:10] was the woman
[1:04:12] now when you think of grafting
[1:04:15] who's ever done grafting before anyone
[1:04:17] done any grafting
[1:04:18] so what you do is you take a a living
[1:04:21] tree or a
[1:04:22] little you know when i was when i did
[1:04:23] grafting was on my friend's orchard when
[1:04:25] i was about
[1:04:26] eight or nine you know and you know so
[1:04:28] anyway so you take a
[1:04:30] stick it just looks like a stick but you
[1:04:32] want the fruit that you know is in that
[1:04:34] stick
[1:04:35] and then you have to cut the the tree or
[1:04:38] whatever that you want to put that stick
[1:04:39] into
[1:04:40] this has got to be a wounding there's
[1:04:42] got to be a cutting
[1:04:44] and then but also the one you put in has
[1:04:46] got to be cut also
[1:04:48] and you push it together and you bind it
[1:04:50] up then the life that's in the roots now
[1:04:52] goes into that branch and it produces
[1:04:54] fruit now
[1:04:55] brother brown says a lot of things about
[1:04:58] uh you know
[1:04:59] different citrus fruit living off say
[1:05:02] tangerines growing off an olive tree
[1:05:04] because
[1:05:05] i mean i mean i mean a orange tree
[1:05:07] because of grafting
[1:05:08] now when i talk about us being grafted
[1:05:10] in i want to use what the apostle paul
[1:05:11] just said about how the gentiles have
[1:05:13] been grafted in
[1:05:14] but there's a great price for that
[1:05:16] grafting there was a lot of cutting
[1:05:18] there was a lot of wounding and it was a
[1:05:21] great
[1:05:22] price that was paid in order that we
[1:05:24] would be
[1:05:25] connected with christ that we would
[1:05:27] bring forth his life
[1:05:29] so when brother speaks about the
[1:05:31] masterpiece he says like with
[1:05:32] michelangelo
[1:05:33] michelangelo had in his mind what moses
[1:05:36] should look like
[1:05:37] and he stood there with a big slab of
[1:05:39] marble and because he was con
[1:05:41] he was commissioned to make it but he
[1:05:43] had hit in his mind this is what
[1:05:45] moses would look like and he spent
[1:05:47] toilets
[1:05:48] hours sanding chiseling at first
[1:05:51] but then sanding it down honing it down
[1:05:53] looking at here moving the light maybe
[1:05:55] look at different angles until finally
[1:05:58] what was in his heart now was manifested
[1:06:00] in front of him
[1:06:01] and he got so inspired he picked up his
[1:06:03] hammer and cried out speak
[1:06:05] because he was so he just thought now
[1:06:07] this thing must live because it's so
[1:06:09] real to him
[1:06:09] and he took it and you can actually see
[1:06:11] it on the knee of of of the statue
[1:06:14] he took the hammer and smacked it on the
[1:06:16] knee and
[1:06:17] you know it was and then so people said
[1:06:19] well that's now a flaw in the
[1:06:20] masterpiece but
[1:06:22] brother brown says it's the floor that
[1:06:24] makes the masterpiece
[1:06:26] it's the floor it's the wounding it's
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:29] it's the disfigured place makes the
[1:06:32] masterpiece you know because
[1:06:34] you know i don't understand how god can
[1:06:36] through death bring life
[1:06:38] i don't understand that but god in his
[1:06:40] great infinite wisdom
[1:06:41] realized that he would he would have to
[1:06:44] redeem us
[1:06:45] and it took death hallelujah remember
[1:06:48] it's not just it's not just him that's
[1:06:49] got to die
[1:06:51] to redeem us and be raised we got to die
[1:06:54] we can't just partake because if we
[1:06:56] partake of just
[1:06:58] the life of god without a death will
[1:07:00] bring forth our own fruit
[1:07:02] this is what he says the denominational
[1:07:04] world has done they're not dead
[1:07:06] but they're holding on to their own
[1:07:07] creeds they're producing their own fruit
[1:07:09] but those who really die hallelujah
[1:07:13] those who really die die to themselves
[1:07:15] let the word be born in them
[1:07:18] don't produce their own life anymore
[1:07:19] they produce his life
[1:07:22] so was the flaw now you think about when
[1:07:25] you know jesus
[1:07:26] you know god was so i you know i i so
[1:07:29] enjoyed this morning
[1:07:31] just that one thought there's jesus in
[1:07:33] gethsemane i could just live on this for
[1:07:35] a long time
[1:07:36] because you think about it you know god
[1:07:39] was a
[1:07:40] god was a know jesus was a man like you
[1:07:42] and i
[1:07:44] brother brown said he could have had got
[1:07:45] married had children he could have done
[1:07:47] a whole lot of things but
[1:07:48] but he was looking beyond the natural no
[1:07:51] you know and and he was looking to
[1:07:53] another kind of wife
[1:07:55] that he wanted to redeem and so the only
[1:07:58] difference we know is he
[1:07:59] you know he was born he bypassed the
[1:08:02] original sin
[1:08:02] he knew who he was but he had a body
[1:08:05] like our bodies
[1:08:07] he was tempted on all points yet without
[1:08:09] sins he could be tempted he could be
[1:08:10] tried
[1:08:11] he got wary he got sick he had hard days
[1:08:14] he had great days you know he had
[1:08:17] struggles he had temptations and
[1:08:19] pressure and
[1:08:20] people pulling on him all kinds of ways
[1:08:22] and and it would have been like brother
[1:08:23] branham
[1:08:24] where brother brown knew when someone
[1:08:26] actually loved him and some were just a
[1:08:27] hypocrite
[1:08:28] but saying brother brown we appreciate
[1:08:29] you so much but he could see beyond it
[1:08:31] by that gift
[1:08:32] and see that person was lying so jesus
[1:08:35] would have been much the same way
[1:08:38] so he went through a lot of things but
[1:08:40] he had to make a choice
[1:08:42] he wanted to grafton a people
[1:08:46] he wanted a grafton a people he didn't
[1:08:48] want to just like adam adam was right
[1:08:50] there in the garden
[1:08:51] and and he was sad he's he's alone
[1:08:54] and god was just reflecting and adam his
[1:08:56] own loneliness
[1:08:58] and it's like when jesus was here his
[1:08:59] whole purpose was i want to gather my
[1:09:01] wife
[1:09:02] i don't want to walk this wall alone i
[1:09:04] want to walk with somebody
[1:09:05] somebody who'll accept me you know
[1:09:08] christianity is polished up too much
[1:09:11] if we could go stand there on mount
[1:09:13] calvary when jesus is gasped with his
[1:09:15] last breath
[1:09:16] and he's marred more than any man and
[1:09:18] the blood's coming down and
[1:09:20] you know people are mocking him making
[1:09:21] fun of him and you know
[1:09:23] and he's not hanging there with a
[1:09:24] loincloth he's stripped naked in front
[1:09:26] of his disciples
[1:09:28] you know there's nothing glamorous in
[1:09:30] that
[1:09:31] there's nothing that's you know you
[1:09:32] could polish up didn't matter what
[1:09:34] filter you put on your instagram post it
[1:09:36] looked ugly
[1:09:38] it would look messy but it was the
[1:09:41] greatest achievement
[1:09:42] that a man could ever achieve where he
[1:09:44] laid down his life for his friends
[1:09:47] hallelujah it didn't matter if the whole
[1:09:48] world went so you know a certain way he
[1:09:50] had a people that he was going to redeem
[1:09:52] and he was determined not my will but
[1:09:54] thy will be done
[1:09:56] he knew that god's will was more
[1:09:57] important than his own will
[1:09:59] hallelujah so to me it's incredible
[1:10:01] where he could because he knew what he
[1:10:02] was going to go through he wasn't
[1:10:04] walking up there blind
[1:10:06] you know when you know when he's
[1:10:07] standing on mount transfiguration moses
[1:10:09] and elijah are preaching to him and it
[1:10:11] says in one of the
[1:10:12] gospels they told him what he had to
[1:10:13] accomplish in jerusalem
[1:10:15] so they preached to him a service i know
[1:10:17] how long but they would have run through
[1:10:19] all the scriptures all the types and
[1:10:20] shadows i don't know how much time it
[1:10:22] took
[1:10:22] probably not that long but anyway after
[1:10:24] that visitation he realized this is why
[1:10:27] i've come into the world
[1:10:29] hallelujah it became real real and i
[1:10:32] believe they would have
[1:10:34] would have spoken to him with a lot of
[1:10:35] passion a lot of you know
[1:10:38] a lot of intensity because no one else
[1:10:41] could do the job
[1:10:42] there wasn't someone else to do the job
[1:10:44] he was the one who had to do the job
[1:10:46] and yet all of that on his heart and he
[1:10:49] could look beyond now and look into
[1:10:52] into the future hallelujah
[1:10:55] amen for this cause i've come into the
[1:10:57] world he went to calvary with one
[1:10:59] scripture that he'd come forth
[1:11:01] i'll not suffer my holy one to see
[1:11:02] corruption i'll not leave his soul in
[1:11:04] hell or suffer my holy one to see
[1:11:06] corruption
[1:11:06] he went to the he went to calvary with
[1:11:08] that on his heart he had a revelation
[1:11:11] hallelujah he had a revelation you can
[1:11:14] put me in the grave i'm going to come
[1:11:15] out of the grave
[1:11:16] no man takes my life from me but i lay
[1:11:19] it down and if i lay it down i'll bring
[1:11:21] it back up again
[1:11:22] hallelujah see when is a man but he had
[1:11:26] to make a choice
[1:11:28] that's because he wanted a grafting if i
[1:11:30] can put it that way
[1:11:32] he saw you and i he didn't want us just
[1:11:35] to walk this life
[1:11:36] as religious people or whatever kind of
[1:11:39] people he wanted his own life to pulsate
[1:11:41] through us
[1:11:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:48] you know i went back and i listened to
[1:11:50] the last part of brother impal's service
[1:11:52] on wednesday
[1:11:54] he makes a lot of statements powerful
[1:11:55] statements right
[1:11:58] where he speaks about we should believe
[1:12:02] and thank god
[1:12:05] they're coming home he said our young
[1:12:08] people are coming back
[1:12:10] i'll go go watch what's the whole thing
[1:12:12] but if not
[1:12:13] what's that portion the last part he's
[1:12:16] burdened about it
[1:12:18] hallelujah because i believe it was god
[1:12:20] was burdened about it
[1:12:21] because we need to look beyond what we
[1:12:23] see and we need to look to the promise
[1:12:26] we need to i you know i pray god just
[1:12:28] anchors him in our souls
[1:12:30] actually it's been taken care of
[1:12:33] hallelujah you know what an incredible
[1:12:37] statement you think of a man hanging on
[1:12:38] across mud more than any man
[1:12:41] and he says it's finished it's finished
[1:12:47] that was his final statement and he
[1:12:49] bowed his head
[1:12:50] and he gave up the ghost he actually
[1:12:52] gave his life he released his own life
[1:12:54] to die
[1:12:56] he says it's finished now when you think
[1:12:59] about something being finished
[1:13:01] to me to me he's saying more than just
[1:13:05] my life is finished or my suffering's
[1:13:08] done
[1:13:09] he's actually saying now the payment for
[1:13:12] the sin of the world
[1:13:14] has been paid hallelujah
[1:13:17] if something's been paid then a purchase
[1:13:19] can be made
[1:13:21] right now we don't have to say well i
[1:13:24] hope it's going to work
[1:13:25] we know it's going to work because it
[1:13:27] already has worked
[1:13:29] has it worked on you and i hallelujah
[1:13:31] has it worked on you and i
[1:13:32] did he take us from being vile sinners
[1:13:34] or just religious people
[1:13:36] pharisees or wherever we're from doesn't
[1:13:37] matter where we came from
[1:13:39] transformed us by the power of his blood
[1:13:41] now we're walking in units of life
[1:13:43] has it worked yes it's a yes
[1:13:47] yes it's worked amen so if it's worked
[1:13:49] on you and i
[1:13:50] why would it not work on somebody else
[1:13:53] hallelujah amen so now
[1:13:57] it is finn i hallelujah
[1:14:01] now when he says it's finished this word
[1:14:04] finished
[1:14:05] it means to conclude something it means
[1:14:07] to accomplish
[1:14:08] to make an end i mean to pay
[1:14:12] uh from the thais dictionary it means to
[1:14:15] perform the last act which completes a
[1:14:17] process
[1:14:19] now as i said to me it's more than just
[1:14:22] his life finishing but he's purchased
[1:14:26] all salvation maybe i'm just going to
[1:14:29] say some things but i trusted anchors
[1:14:30] deep
[1:14:31] he purchased all salvation all
[1:14:34] deliverance
[1:14:35] all liberty all healing
[1:14:38] all of it so he he purchased
[1:14:42] my salvation your salvation
[1:14:46] our family salvation our love on
[1:14:48] salvation
[1:14:49] it doesn't matter where they are he
[1:14:51] purchased it
[1:14:53] doesn't matter their age he purchased it
[1:14:55] he purchased their deliverance
[1:14:58] from unbelief from the demons of hell he
[1:15:00] purchased it
[1:15:02] harlow because he purchased it for you
[1:15:04] and i he pushed it for them
[1:15:06] amen so what it is finished
[1:15:09] and that's why really when you think
[1:15:11] about it
[1:15:13] we should be the most thankful people
[1:15:18] thank you lord thank you lord
[1:15:21] not just for our own salvation i'm not
[1:15:23] talking about just for ourselves and
[1:15:25] looking back at the past of what he's
[1:15:26] done for us but no
[1:15:28] if he's done something in the past for
[1:15:30] us then he'll do it in the future for us
[1:15:32] because he's the same god
[1:15:33] amen hallelujah you following me i trust
[1:15:36] this kind of
[1:15:36] means something i mean to be saved in
[1:15:38] the past we can thank him because it's
[1:15:40] easy to look back
[1:15:41] but what about with the eyes of faith
[1:15:43] looking forward and saying lord you did
[1:15:45] it there you're this and you purchased
[1:15:47] that
[1:15:47] and this here hallelujah so we can begin
[1:15:49] to thank god amen
[1:15:52] thank you for my family hallelujah and i
[1:15:55] heard a brother pray i don't know where
[1:15:56] it was but he says i'm thanking you lord
[1:15:58] he begins to list a whole bunch of
[1:15:59] things
[1:15:59] i'm thanking you lord for my salvation
[1:16:01] i'm thanking you lord for my family
[1:16:02] salvation i'm thanking you all for
[1:16:04] healing i'm thanking you lord for
[1:16:05] healing this person just
[1:16:06] because he's praying for all the needs
[1:16:08] in the church i'm thanking you lord for
[1:16:09] the wayward when the
[1:16:10] and the ones who have gone off and the
[1:16:12] ones who are entering it i'm thanking
[1:16:14] you lord for them coming home
[1:16:16] hallelujah and by the end of that prayer
[1:16:18] i was just like amen
[1:16:20] holy that's how we should be i'm
[1:16:22] thanking you lord they're coming
[1:16:23] you know what i love is it's not how you
[1:16:25] know it's not us in our mind working out
[1:16:27] how it's going to happen
[1:16:28] that's irrelevant how it's going to
[1:16:29] happen it's that god is going to begin
[1:16:31] to act
[1:16:32] amen i think we had the scripture this
[1:16:34] morning he ever liveth to make us into
[1:16:36] sessions for us
[1:16:37] hallelujah so if he's gonna intercede
[1:16:39] for us i mean that means he's gonna act
[1:16:41] on our behalf
[1:16:42] we have an advocate jesus christ our
[1:16:44] high priest he's working on
[1:16:45] our behalf so his work on our behalf
[1:16:47] he'll do things we cannot do
[1:16:51] hallelujah that's why we should be
[1:16:54] thanking god
[1:16:55] whoever thanks god in prayer you thank
[1:16:58] god for things you don't even see
[1:17:00] thank god for the current state maybe
[1:17:02] very opposite what do you thank him for
[1:17:04] but you begin to thank him
[1:17:06] amen hallelujah
[1:17:09] it is finished
[1:17:13] he was mad more than any
[1:17:17] other human being that's because
[1:17:22] he had to what a price that had to be
[1:17:24] paid to graft a sin
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:27] that we would be partakers of his life
[1:17:31] that it wouldn't be us living no more it
[1:17:34] would be him living
[1:17:40] brother bam says this and i think it's a
[1:17:43] mighty conqueror
[1:17:46] before any victory can be won there must
[1:17:49] be great prices paid
[1:17:51] oh what prices sometimes they're very
[1:17:53] deep
[1:17:54] they can make great scars are tearing
[1:17:56] down but in order to have the mountain
[1:17:58] you've got to have the valley
[1:18:00] before you can have the sunshine you've
[1:18:01] got to get the rain before you can have
[1:18:03] the light you've got to get the night
[1:18:05] before we can have right we've had to
[1:18:07] have wrong we would never know what
[1:18:09] wrong was
[1:18:10] but in order to conquer and to win the
[1:18:12] greatest battle was ever won
[1:18:14] one stepped out of glory many years ago
[1:18:17] he did not take upon himself the form of
[1:18:19] an angel
[1:18:19] he did not come as some great person but
[1:18:22] he was going to prove it did not take
[1:18:24] muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to
[1:18:26] win a war
[1:18:27] he clothed himself in humility like a
[1:18:29] little baby was born in a manger
[1:18:31] there was not even a place for his birth
[1:18:33] when he come
[1:18:34] i want you to look at the different
[1:18:36] material of warfare
[1:18:38] what he used i'm going to stop there he
[1:18:40] didn't use argument
[1:18:42] he didn't use pressure he used something
[1:18:45] very different
[1:18:46] now adam's race was all in bondage there
[1:18:48] they were without hope without god
[1:18:50] without chance without mercy
[1:18:52] without anything that could help them
[1:18:53] the great enemies of the lower regions
[1:18:55] of the lost
[1:18:56] had them shut up in darkness there was
[1:18:58] no way out there was no one could help
[1:19:01] nothing could be done it looked like a
[1:19:03] total complete loss
[1:19:05] but our hero who came down from the
[1:19:07] portals of glory condescending down
[1:19:09] for there was not a man on earth that
[1:19:11] could do the job they were all as
[1:19:13] worldly speaking in the same boat
[1:19:15] we were all born in sin shaped in
[1:19:17] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:19:19] none of us could help each other we
[1:19:21] stood helpless defeated chaos in every
[1:19:24] hand
[1:19:24] all united we could not keep the laws
[1:19:27] and ceremonies finding their weaknesses
[1:19:29] and so forth we could not do it
[1:19:31] and it seemed like the whole human race
[1:19:33] was laid waste
[1:19:35] and then he come and he came down
[1:19:38] because he was in the beginning the
[1:19:39] bible said he was the word
[1:19:41] he was the logos that went out of god
[1:19:43] and the logos in the beginning was the
[1:19:45] word and he became the word
[1:19:46] then when he ascended up on that
[1:19:48] glorious day of easter
[1:19:50] he became not only the word but he
[1:19:52] became the high priest of his own word
[1:19:54] oh what a glorious thing brother neville
[1:19:56] just think of it he's not only the word
[1:19:57] but he is the high priest of his own
[1:19:59] word how could we doubt it how could we
[1:20:02] walk to him and not believe that we
[1:20:03] receive
[1:20:04] what we ask for for he is the word and
[1:20:06] the intercessor of the word
[1:20:08] the logos became word and the word
[1:20:10] became flesh
[1:20:11] and the same flesh that was word
[1:20:13] received up in the glory now is the high
[1:20:15] priest making intercession by himself to
[1:20:17] his
[1:20:18] word oh that's what it takes that's the
[1:20:20] material that the church has got what a
[1:20:22] weapon
[1:20:23] there's never been one like it he was
[1:20:25] the word and when he come he was born in
[1:20:27] a manger
[1:20:28] he came to use the weapon of l-o-v-e
[1:20:31] love to conquer the world not with army
[1:20:33] bullets not with machine guns and tanks
[1:20:35] but he come in a different manner
[1:20:37] he come in the form of love he was god's
[1:20:40] love
[1:20:40] one time as little boy i used to think
[1:20:42] that christ loved me and god hated me
[1:20:44] because christ died for me
[1:20:46] but god had something against me but i
[1:20:48] come to find out that christ is the very
[1:20:50] heart of god
[1:20:51] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:20:53] only begotten son that
[1:20:55] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:20:56] perish but have eternal life
[1:20:58] now he come first to conquer and the
[1:21:00] thing that the devil has put in the
[1:21:02] world was hatred
[1:21:03] and he come to conquer hatred when we
[1:21:05] win our battles and so forth in the
[1:21:07] world's battles
[1:21:08] it always leaves continually a hatred
[1:21:11] because battles of that is of the enemy
[1:21:13] but christ
[1:21:14] come with love to conquer hatred to love
[1:21:16] those who were
[1:21:17] unlovable he come with a different
[1:21:20] weapon and he humbled himself
[1:21:21] made him a little lower than the angels
[1:21:23] to suffer death
[1:21:24] and to give an example and when he was
[1:21:26] here on earth he walked
[1:21:28] among men
[1:21:32] hallelujah
[1:21:37] he paid a great price
[1:21:40] it wasn't an easy thing for him to do
[1:21:44] but yet because of love
[1:21:47] because he was god's redemption
[1:21:50] manifested
[1:21:52] he was determined hallelujah
[1:21:56] and he did the job
[1:21:59] now here we are i'm not going to be much
[1:22:01] longer but
[1:22:03] here we are in 2021
[1:22:06] here we are it seems like a very late
[1:22:10] hour
[1:22:12] i'll say this it doesn't matter how dark
[1:22:13] the world gets
[1:22:15] our god is greater his sacrifice is
[1:22:18] still more than enough
[1:22:20] the power that he released through the
[1:22:21] blood is still more than enough amen he
[1:22:24] released the power
[1:22:25] by his holy ghost that day amen that
[1:22:28] conquers
[1:22:29] all devils right conquers all sickness
[1:22:33] conquers all unbelief conquers all
[1:22:35] superstition
[1:22:37] conquers all prejudice conquers all
[1:22:39] malice strife
[1:22:40] envy conquers it all hallelujah
[1:22:44] and it doesn't matter how much this
[1:22:46] world is unbelieving or whatever it is
[1:22:48] doesn't matter how gross darkness is on
[1:22:50] the people there is a light that shineth
[1:22:53] greater than the darkness
[1:22:55] because the darkness is just absence of
[1:22:57] light
[1:22:58] but when light shines darkness flees
[1:23:01] hallelujah did he win as a man
[1:23:08] and he humbled himself to the death of
[1:23:09] the cross
[1:23:11] you know it's very easy to talk about
[1:23:13] the glory of the resurrection
[1:23:15] but it started with a un
[1:23:19] selfish decision which led to death
[1:23:24] to bring forth life now
[1:23:28] what about you and i
[1:23:32] death must happen for life to come forth
[1:23:36] i'll say it's very easy for us to get
[1:23:38] stuck in our ways
[1:23:40] this is how church goes i just go i'm
[1:23:42] going to preach to myself especially
[1:23:44] this is how church goes this is what
[1:23:47] this is what will happen
[1:23:48] we'll sing these songs these people will
[1:23:50] praise like this the pray
[1:23:51] the other parts will preach this way
[1:23:53] we'll go and have lunch and this is just
[1:23:55] how it works
[1:23:56] and we get to an expectation and that
[1:23:59] expectation
[1:24:01] is really there's no scale i have but
[1:24:03] it's really well below what it should be
[1:24:06] right if we have god
[1:24:10] who created heavens and earth hallelujah
[1:24:13] that came to dwell he died that he'd
[1:24:14] dwell on you and i
[1:24:16] i mean that god would come and live and
[1:24:18] do things far beyond we could do
[1:24:20] you know there's no one greater than our
[1:24:21] god no devil
[1:24:23] no complex no unbelief no superstition
[1:24:26] no trouble no indifference i mean
[1:24:29] nothing no lukewarmness is greater than
[1:24:31] our god
[1:24:32] hallelujah no no scars of the past
[1:24:34] nothing
[1:24:35] nothing of that is greater than our god
[1:24:37] hallelujah amen he is more powerful than
[1:24:40] anything but in order for him to live
[1:24:43] there must be a death
[1:24:45] hallelujah and it's not many times
[1:24:47] people get put pressure on different age
[1:24:49] brackets in the church saying they've
[1:24:50] got to come to their place and hurry up
[1:24:52] actually
[1:24:52] it's all of us have got to start with
[1:24:54] the death from the pastor to the janitor
[1:24:56] amen we've all got to die
[1:24:59] if we want to have a resurrection season
[1:25:01] you say well we're in the bright age it
[1:25:03] can be far greater than what we're
[1:25:04] experiencing
[1:25:06] right this can be a far greater revival
[1:25:09] hallelujah i love that brother moses
[1:25:11] speaking about the different brothers
[1:25:13] they had the bible they brought a
[1:25:14] revival
[1:25:16] hallelujah we have the same bible the
[1:25:18] same god
[1:25:19] maybe a different season but he's the
[1:25:21] same one otherwise he can produce the
[1:25:23] same things
[1:25:24] amen so why on earth should we ever live
[1:25:26] below our privilege
[1:25:27] holy but we serve a supernatural god
[1:25:30] amen that can come and live in our life
[1:25:32] and shake your world
[1:25:33] amen but it's up to us
[1:25:36] are we willing to stay dead
[1:25:41] are we willing to die not to build a
[1:25:44] barricade of quotes and scriptures
[1:25:46] as an excuse of just being a formal
[1:25:48] believer
[1:25:50] you know because it's very easy to build
[1:25:51] a a fortress of quotes and scriptures
[1:25:54] and
[1:25:55] you know but i'm mature now and i've
[1:25:56] seen too much and you know
[1:25:58] and people make an excuse why they can't
[1:26:01] walk in their first love
[1:26:03] but jesus was in his first love all the
[1:26:05] time
[1:26:07] i have a joy set before me
[1:26:12] i've got a joy when he calls his
[1:26:14] disciples he is calling a part of his
[1:26:16] joy
[1:26:17] come walk with me peter james and john
[1:26:20] he went to the woman of the well come
[1:26:21] walk with me
[1:26:22] mary magdalene come walk with me harlow
[1:26:24] because he had a joy set before him
[1:26:27] holla he knew would cause his death he
[1:26:29] didn't just want to be with him he
[1:26:30] wanted to be in them
[1:26:32] hallelujah and in order for them to be
[1:26:35] grafted in
[1:26:37] holy he knew every stripe he'd receive
[1:26:41] he knew the crown when he put on his
[1:26:43] head he knew his bed would be ripped out
[1:26:45] he knew all the laughter the mockery and
[1:26:47] the everything he'd go through
[1:26:50] that didn't make him shrink back and all
[1:26:52] you know humanly yes but
[1:26:54] it didn't make him lose his first love
[1:26:57] hallelujah now if he walked
[1:27:01] you know his ministry started in jordan
[1:27:03] under death and finished in a death to
[1:27:05] bring forth life
[1:27:08] what about you and i
[1:27:12] we can't just now as i said hello you're
[1:27:14] here but i'm preaching to myself
[1:27:17] we can't continue on as we are there's
[1:27:19] more there's more to have
[1:27:21] there's more to experience i mean
[1:27:23] there's more of god to live
[1:27:25] hallelujah because many times we're
[1:27:27] pulling out i hear saying how on earth
[1:27:29] how on earth can the revival continue
[1:27:31] down to another generation
[1:27:33] and we look at everything that we have
[1:27:35] trouble and we look but we should just
[1:27:37] thank god
[1:27:39] and worship and love him hallelujah
[1:27:43] what did that little baby bear do when
[1:27:45] when they went and trashed brother
[1:27:47] brown's tent
[1:27:49] he just found the molasses bucket
[1:27:52] and he ended up wearing all that he just
[1:27:54] got in there and the mother was saying
[1:27:56] come on church is finished get out of
[1:27:57] there
[1:27:58] you know this guy guy's turned up and we
[1:27:59] don't know what he's gonna do and you
[1:28:01] know
[1:28:01] get out of the word you know stop being
[1:28:03] so happy and then he wasn't
[1:28:04] he was you know one of them yeah part of
[1:28:06] him god that's mama calling me but this
[1:28:08] is too good and
[1:28:09] you know and then finally he ends up
[1:28:11] wearing the whole thing and then he goes
[1:28:13] out there and mama wasn't upset
[1:28:15] i even just grabbed and started looking
[1:28:17] and the other cub just started looking
[1:28:19] hey what happened they had a good old
[1:28:20] revival
[1:28:22] because of what he was feeding on
[1:28:25] hallelujah
[1:28:26] and everything in the word we need
[1:28:29] revival
[1:28:30] it's in the bible hallelujah it's in the
[1:28:33] message
[1:28:34] amen the spirit of god is here to anoint
[1:28:36] this word and make it live in you and i
[1:28:39] it's not coming it's here that's why he
[1:28:42] rose
[1:28:43] i meant the spirit of god would anoint
[1:28:44] this word i would live in our lives
[1:28:47] hallelujah yeah so sometimes we get so
[1:28:49] worried about things happening around us
[1:28:52] but we can begin to praise god i'm
[1:28:54] thanking you lord
[1:28:56] i'm thanking you lord for my healing i'm
[1:28:58] thanking you lord for my deliverance
[1:29:00] i'm thanking you lord for the family
[1:29:01] circle being unbroken on that day
[1:29:03] i'm thank remember we've already been
[1:29:04] told it
[1:29:07] the reason john ryan could walk around
[1:29:09] and say thank you lord praise the lord
[1:29:10] i'm healed
[1:29:11] because god told him thus saith the lord
[1:29:13] he wasn't trying to work himself
[1:29:15] up i mean but when the word is quickened
[1:29:17] to you i mean when the promise is made
[1:29:19] alive and as i said on friday i wish i
[1:29:21] had it on the big screen
[1:29:22] that this quickening power is here to
[1:29:24] quicken every promise on the grounds to
[1:29:26] you and i
[1:29:27] every promise on the grounds is alive to
[1:29:29] you and i that means that every
[1:29:30] salvation of our family is for us
[1:29:32] you know i was thinking hallelujah we
[1:29:35] have a
[1:29:36] believer's culture no i'm not talking
[1:29:39] about dress
[1:29:39] nationality cuisine no no there's a
[1:29:42] culture in the believer to behave a
[1:29:43] certain way
[1:29:45] and if you look at moses he had a
[1:29:48] culture
[1:29:49] pharaoh i'm not compromising with you
[1:29:52] i'm bringing everyone with me we're not
[1:29:54] leaving one hoof behind
[1:29:56] and he was determined we're all coming
[1:29:59] there was a culture that's what i'm
[1:30:01] talking about culture i mean and that
[1:30:03] same
[1:30:03] life is in you and i although that same
[1:30:06] determination should be you and i
[1:30:08] satan you're not keeping them you may
[1:30:10] have had them for decades or years or
[1:30:12] whatever more
[1:30:13] we may have just woken up to the fact
[1:30:15] hey our children need to be saved
[1:30:18] hallelujah it's good to wake up to that
[1:30:19] realization because now
[1:30:21] you can go to prayer about it you know
[1:30:23] brother caid's preached a sermon i was
[1:30:25] telling brother armand he preached a
[1:30:26] sermon
[1:30:27] trouble brings purpose hallelujah
[1:30:31] holy amen so trouble in our life should
[1:30:34] bring purpose
[1:30:35] and that purpose should not be to
[1:30:36] complain but that purpose should be to
[1:30:38] drive ourselves to god
[1:30:40] say god undertake for me because
[1:30:42] troubles come
[1:30:44] hallelujah and it should bring us
[1:30:45] purpose

[1:30:51] have
[1:30:52] there is more to have there's more in
[1:30:54] this word that we have
[1:30:55] i don't even think we've touched the
[1:30:56] sides of it yet oh
[1:30:58] there's a reality of god you know there
[1:31:01] is untapped resources in god the prophet
[1:31:03] tells us
[1:31:04] untapped resources so i say god may we
[1:31:06] not be distracted by this world
[1:31:09] but may we be so gripped what what are
[1:31:12] you gripped by i want to see jesus live

[1:31:22] around us doesn't matter what troubles
[1:31:24] around us i want to see jesus
[1:31:25] live hallelujah and a good way to start
[1:31:28] at a shop bit of love

[1:33:49] we we're not just talking about saying
[1:33:51] maybe one day no no we're there to
[1:33:52] possess
[1:33:53] we're there to possess every promise
[1:33:55] this is who we are
[1:33:56] that's how we're built to be that's not
[1:33:58] something we become that's just how
[1:34:00] we're built
[1:34:00] i mean by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:02] we're built that way
[1:34:05] hallelujah he was wounded now we're just
[1:34:09] going to maybe transition to the
[1:34:10] communion bars what do you think about
[1:34:12] it
[1:34:13] lord he took the bread and he break it
[1:34:17] i don't know what was going through his
[1:34:18] mind when he took the bread and he broke
[1:34:20] it
[1:34:21] but no doubt because he because he was
[1:34:23] led by vision remember
[1:34:25] so no doubt when he was told about what
[1:34:27] he would suffer
[1:34:29] he saw it by vision this is just me so
[1:34:31] he saw the beatings the mockery the
[1:34:33] rejection
[1:34:34] he saw it by vision and then he saw
[1:34:37] himself living out that vision
[1:34:39] because of a choice so when he looked at
[1:34:42] his disciples he picked up the bread
[1:34:44] he broke it maybe say this is my body
[1:34:48] which is broken
[1:34:50] and he saw it come through his mind or
[1:34:52] something
[1:34:54] you may just see this
[1:35:00] the disciples just saw this
[1:35:05] but what that represented what he knew
[1:35:08] that would mean
[1:35:11] but he wanted some people to be grafted
[1:35:14] hallelujah he was singing of you and i
[1:35:17] those sacred hands took that bread and
[1:35:19] break it
[1:35:20] hallelujah because he wanted us to be
[1:35:23] part of this bread
[1:35:25] we're one bread we're one body we're not
[1:35:28] divided
[1:35:30] hallelujah be knew the cost
[1:35:33] that we would come and be grafted in
[1:35:37] that his life will come forth
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:40] as i said it took a death
[1:35:44] it'll take a death a greater
[1:35:45] consecration
[1:35:48] we want to see god more i'll take a
[1:35:51] greater consecration
[1:35:53] it'll take a death there's a lot of
[1:35:55] things maybe we're going to die
[1:35:56] out too but it's worth it it's worth it
[1:36:00] when we're around the throne there'll be
[1:36:03] no regret
[1:36:04] we won't be i missed out on that and i
[1:36:06] can't believe i didn't see that one and
[1:36:07] not to do that no i missed
[1:36:09] there won't be any of that that won't
[1:36:12] even be near our mind
[1:36:13] but thank god thank god you got me here
[1:36:16] lord thank god you put something in my
[1:36:18] soul for you
[1:36:20] it wasn't me that chose he said to his
[1:36:22] disciples you didn't choose me i chose
[1:36:24] you
[1:36:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:30] amen amen let's go to first corinthians
[1:36:34] 11.
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:37] let's read the scripture here
[1:36:43] hallelujah i love him don't you
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:48] where would we be
[1:36:52] i love that this morning he knew we
[1:36:55] needed him in this day
[1:37:01] hey man we're gonna go to first
[1:37:04] corinthians 11 and 23
[1:37:10] for i have received of the lord that
[1:37:13] which also i delivered unto you
[1:37:16] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:37:18] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:37:20] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:37:22] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:37:26] which is broken for you this during
[1:37:27] remembrance of me
[1:37:29] and after the manna also he took the cup
[1:37:32] when he had sup
[1:37:32] saying this cup is the new testament in
[1:37:34] my blood
[1:37:36] this bad me do ye as off as you drink it
[1:37:39] in remembrance of me
[1:37:40] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:37:43] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:37:44] death till he come
[1:37:46] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:37:48] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:37:49] unworthily
[1:37:51] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:37:53] the lord
[1:37:55] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:37:57] him eat of that bread
[1:37:59] and drink of that cup for he that drink
[1:38:01] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:38:03] and drinketh damnation to himself not
[1:38:05] discerning the lord's body
[1:38:07] for this cause many a weak and sickly
[1:38:09] among you and many sleep
[1:38:11] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:38:13] should not be judged
[1:38:15] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:38:17] of the lord
[1:38:19] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:38:21] world wherefore my brethren when ye
[1:38:24] come together to eat carry ye one for
[1:38:26] another
[1:38:27] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:38:28] home that you come not together under
[1:38:31] condemnation
[1:38:32] and the rest will i sit in order when i
[1:38:34] come
[1:38:35] so this is an open communion table but
[1:38:38] we have to examine ourselves
[1:38:41] lord is there unconfessed sin in my life
[1:38:42] do i need to put something right lord
[1:38:44] examine me
[1:38:46] right because we can't take of this
[1:38:49] unworthily amen
[1:38:53] but if we confess it all and lay it all
[1:38:55] in the lord's hands
[1:38:56] but it's all up to you amen
[1:38:59] but what a to me it's always a sacred
[1:39:01] moment
[1:39:03] lord you'd you were marred more than any
[1:39:06] man
[1:39:08] that by your grace i'd be grafted in as
[1:39:11] a from a while being a wild olive tree
[1:39:13] grafted into the
[1:39:14] hallelujah amen and by your death
[1:39:18] you purchased my salvation everything i
[1:39:21] need off for this earthly journey and
[1:39:23] you
[1:39:23] it's been paid for it's been paid in
[1:39:26] full friends
[1:39:28] hallelujah amen so brother

[1:39:33] to come forward
