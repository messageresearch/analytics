========================================

[Music] good morning all very welcome in the uh in the house of the Lord um this morning I just want to share a quick um it's not a testimony but um I've listened to a a few messages now on the train and back with uh all the interviews in town and and the one that stuck with me was um uh brother Chad made a reference to um uh brother brandom's thirst sermon and the the definition of thirst struck me and I just want to read that um as as a definition it's it's have a strong desire for something but then it goes on and saying it's a crave it's a want it's a cover it it's a desire a hunger um for after a lust almost it's a very strong it's a yearn and um I think if I'm not mistaken the quote that or the definition that brother brandham used was a painful desire to have a thirst now we we are after this we are we are wanting this and that's why we're here today to day cuz there's no other place out from this that we can go and receive this we I can not go and receive this any any place in the world and I want to tie that into a little story when we had our trip in South Africa I had the big privilege of having kidney stones while we were there and but you get there and it's all this you know oh I long I crave I yearn for you know the taste of their Coca-Cola the taste of Tropa Tropa was this little creamy milky thing yogis Everything Everything but water so I was just drinking and now all of a sudden the climate's changed and I you know you pirate more and it's you have to drink more water but I did all the substitutes and yes you can go and have that outside there there will be a substitute for water there will be a substitute for this and and quenching your thirst but you will never get quenched and I it just struck me that the the the word the painful desire um and I think the reference he used brother brandham was a deer that got hurt um he he had immediate thirst and a his sole mission on Earth for that moment was to get to a uh a brook to go and drink water and that's that's all that was and please have that desire this morning to just come here and come and quench your thirst just come and um come and rest here at the brook come and relax and and and and and enjoy God's atmosphere that he uh that he provides us I'll open in prayer and and we can start and uh like like Brother Andy always said come and spend your energy I just want to say come and come and rest so that the Holy Spirit can come and come and work under us and we can enter that atmosphere good morning Lord and thank you for a wonderful privilege that we can be here today that we can come and find a a place where we can quench our thirst that we can have a wonderful pure Fellowship around your word and and the word in season today that's being brought I want to come and bless

you musicians thank you brother Ed amen morning everyone amen it's always good to be here amen amen if you got your Bibles handy let's just go to Romans uh 6 and and verse one so just a reminder that uh next weekend when um brother Mar and sister Nomi are up uh we're going to have a evening service have communion foot washing so we have that around 3:30 so um amen it's always a blessing to be around the Lord's table and remember what he has done for us let's read from Romans 6 And1 and we're going to read down to verse 11 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall uh uh God for it how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death therefore we are baptized with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall uh we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not uh we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe we should also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and now let's go to Galatians and and uh chapter 2 we're going to read verse 16 down to verse 19 Galatians 2:6 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no man no flesh be justified but if while ye seek to be justified by Christ ye ourselves also found Sinners is there in um is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid for if I build again uh the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor for through the law for through the law um am dead to the law that I might live unto God now this really I want to get to verse 20 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats so if I could take a um if I could take a subject I want to I want to take the there in verse 20 the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God so the Apostle Paul he knew what he was talking about you know when he would write to the when he was inspired by the Lord to write to the uh the Epistles you know all of them you know and and what we just read to the Romans and to the Galatians you know he was not just writing from a theological viewpoint but he had a real experience where once his life was governed by his own human Faith amen he was he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees you know he was he was raised under the greatest teacher of the time Gia who who who knew the scriptures backwards and forwards and you know he was a very learned man but yet the life that he lived was a very different life to the life he began to live when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus right amen so he was more than just you know to to him it was more than just changing a mindset or swapping a collection of doctrines for a new one amen it was more than just forsaking you know the the the religion of the Pharisees and walking in a you know a new understanding but it was it was he met the very author that wrote the Old Testament I mean he wrote The Very God that that wrote the Bible through Moses and through the prophets and he began to see that it was more than just Doctrine or a way of life but it was a life amen it was because he says the life I now live so the life that he was living after he met the Lord on the road to Damascus was a very different kind of life not just because he changed his beliefs but because eternal life had come into him am mean so he's now living not by a natural life that would perish but he was living by an eternal life the very God that created heavens and earth came and dwelt in him and that was the life that was living out of him amen because he he said now reckon yourselves dead amen likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so you have to reckon Yourself Dead amen that the old you has been dead it's been buried hallelujah amen that that old life Jesus Took up Calvary that day it's been nailed to a cross amen it's been done away with that the believer does not have to live by their first nature their first natural life that will perish but the believer now lives and operates by the life of God himself Hallelujah because he says now it's very important when we read there in Galatians 2 and 20 he says the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God he doesn't he does not say that he lives this life in uh with faith in the Son of God but by the faith of the Son of God it's a very different thing even though it's just a change of a you know change of a word but to live by the faith of the Son of God is that same Faith or that same life that was in Jesus Christ the man now came into Paul himself so the very life that was being lived out of Paul wasn't his own life anymore but it was the life of Jesus Christ himself and it's the same thing with every believer the life we now live I trust you can actually say Paul I've had the same kind of experience amen where you can see the life I now live every day amen I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen to that Faith because faith is a revelation amen Faith real faith is a revelation amen it is not something you can learn it's not something you can earn but it's revealed to you sovereignly by Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah so it's a revelation and when God Reveals His word to you you can't you can't forget it you can't change your mind about it it becomes a very part of you amen it becomes a very part of your being and you cannot deny it no more than you could deny yourself Hallelujah so Paul began to operate in a very different way he was a Pharisee but then he became into his real position as a Son of God Amen and he recognized he was the Son of God he wasn't afraid to say I have been birthed amen I've been born again amen I'm a new creature in Christ all things have passed away and all things have be all things have passed away and all things have became new he wasn't afraid to recognize who he was and it's the same thing with you and I friends we can't just sit back and say well I'm just a sinner saved by grace we are sinners saved by grace absolutely no man could save himself you couldn't save yourself you know man is tried to reform himself for thousands of years and if everyone failed I mean every self-help book could never get to the core root of unbelief and cast that out because we understand that sin the attributes of sin of what you see around us in Civilization today are you following me amen and all the self-help books in the world cannot undo that unbelief that causes people Amen to live in a in a way that they hate themselves and they can't even you know have peace with their own selves that's right amen are you with me amen amen when God comes upon the sea Hallelujah he gives you a new nature and then you can even have peace with yourself amen instead of looking in the mirror and saying I hate this guy and I hate how he does and I hate his personality amen a new life comes into you and you make peace Hallelujah not just with God but with yourself amen because you begin to recognize God made me a certain way amen and in our humanity and in our little quirks and our in you know intentes or whatever you call it you know God God made us this way yeah I mean God God caused people to you know move from one part of the world to another part of the world to marry a certain person to bring forth a certain characteristic and down and down and down in certain cultures and certain places God was molding you thank you Lord God was bringing you forth amen because you know Abraham Paul says in the book of Hebrews that Levi was in Abraham when Abraham paid TI to mesed he wasn't saying figuratively saying literally Levi was in him amen so the experiences and that was attributed to Levi yes amen so all the things that Abraham did amen affected Levi in some way amen and that's just a natural lineage right Hallelujah you got to think of a supernatural lineage I mean cuz it's not a not a nation you come from which means you're the bride of Christ or your your parents or whatever you're the Wim blo where it listed you don't know where it comes from don't know where it goes so does everyone's born by the spirit of God God just blows into a place Hallelujah the word just comes into a place then you find yourself in a very different kind of way hallelujah amen so now that's why we should just Rejoice you know we can't shrink back we are sinners saved by grace but Esther yeah you look at Queen Esther I know I've said it before but she was placed as Queen she didn't make herself Queen amen she was just obedient to the word of Hagi cuz Hagi knew the heart of the king that's right amen she didn't think of how how how can I please the king to marry marry the king of this great Empire he just she just knew this man knows his heart I'm going to listen to him how should I dress how should I conduct myself what should I do hag I said do this amen and she said I'll do it Hallelujah and then she found herself with a crown on her head amen but remember her first nature was she was a Jew we all know this but but the Jews have never been liked they've never been liked doesn't matter you go through their history they've been persecuted they've been kicked out of countries they've been killed all systematically tried to be wiped out you know they've never been liked so her her first her her first birth her first identity was not even liked in that Empire you with me she couldn't even use morai said don't go by your Jewish name hadassa go by you know the Gentile Persian name Esther so she had to deny her even the name she was given here she is so she's got a dilemma going on and then now here comes the great crunch time the enemy is signed put it into had had the king to sign a death warrant for your whole race state state sanctu genocide amen here it is and the and and there's Jews in the promised land trying to rebuild the Temple at this time and it's been put into law all the Jews must be killed on the 13th day the 12th month or whenever it was and here's the one woman in a position one believer in a position Hallelujah and she can do something about it amen the other ones could maybe try and arm themselves and say how are we're going to figure this out but here's this here's this one woman Hallelujah and she's married to the king she finds herself in the right place at the right time and Mori just throws it out there perhaps youve come into the kingdom for a Time such as this you with me and then so God really throws it out to you even today perhaps you've come into the kingdom amen amen perhaps you've come into the kingdom that your family will come in amen that your loved ones will be saved Deliverance will come to your house perhaps you've come to a kingdom for a Time such as just throwing it out there am me I've been thinking very you know I've been listening to you know uh Melanie sing the song take me into the holy of holies there's a line in that song Here I Am take the cold yes here I am amen thinking about me thinking about you here I am amen here I am today Glory take the Cal touch my lips here I am that's how the line goes I think that should be our burden Here I Am Lord I'm Available I'm alive I Believe In You Here I Am Lord shake this world Hallelujah shake it one more time God thank you Lord amen that's not too crazy here I am hey Isaiah said that who will go for us sees the Lord high and lifted up in the temple he's a prophet he knows what it's like to go into the temple but something's very different now am mean the influence of the King has died because King Uzziah died and he was leaning very heavily on the shoulder of that King CU he admired him so much but it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord high and lifted up he went into the temple was in distress Hallelujah then he sees the Cher of the serams in the place shaking he says I'm undone I'm an unclean man living amongst unclean people he's a prophet recognizes that he's lost and undone when he's in the presence of God am me then the then the Angel takes the call touches his lips your sin has been purged and then the call Goes Forth who go for us am mean God has to use man amen amen you you remember times we wait oh God do this God do this and God's saying you go do it amen you go speak to that person you go pray Hallelujah you use that burden channel that burden thank you Lord hey it's a blessing to have a burden blessing to have a burden for family blessing to have a burden for someone amen cuz this this Society is just Cruise along sweet as bro it's all fine amen that's not how we should be we should have real burden yes Amen Hallelujah Lord I want to yeah brother Ed said you know some glad morning when this life is over or say or some glad morning I'm going to take a Rapture I said amen amen amen and there should be a longing there should be beling that's right I heard as quite a few years ago I heard brother Ed Bisal preach a service and he said you go listen to the prayer lines there's not one person that the heart of the of the persons discerned by the spirit of the Lord and the prophet saying you want to see a Rapture you want to see a body change there's not one and that should be our really deep down we come with you know we have our burdens we have our questions we have our you know our needs and our things want to see answered in prayer but the thing that should really be down the core of us amen you want to see a resurrection amen amen you want to see it change in the body you want to see your body come young again am mean you want to see the dead in Christ rise amen you want to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air Hallelujah this should be our heart's cry amen it should be above all things we have needs absolutely don't let your burdens weigh you down that's right amen cuz God is the answer for every burden you say I've never seen an answer Abraham waited 25 years and every day humanly it got more impossible it was already impossible to begin with but it got more impossible but he was strong in faith didn't even bring into a well I've been I've been beaten down I've been trotten down I've been rejected I've been despised even by my own family amen don't let it wear you down amen amen but be strong in faith cuz the devil has to let go that's right Hallelujah and that's not Pie in the Sky amen you got to believe amen amen amen don't despair do not be weary and wello do not be weary and wello because the life we now live with we live by the faith of Jesus Christ amen yes are you with me I'm not trying to you know sometimes I feel devil says well he's just trying to excite you and make you all excited no I'm not Faith we're called to believe all things are possible all things are possible to them that believe that's what we're called and we're not called to look at what we think we are or our state or our track record or our history forget it that's right Paul said forgetting the things that true in the past what does that mean forget it what happened in the past I don't remember amen I'm pressing to the mark of the high quing that's what we should do press the mark of the High Calling well it's a train wreck back there but what about tomorrow amen amen Paul said that he blasphemed he actually planned he consented that the Christians the faith he now had he was trying to destroy amen that could have been a big Guilt Trip amen he said but he said but by the grace of God I am what I am Hallelujah so don't worry about what the pastors done don't even worry about what this morning did what you did this morning he said Lord forgive me get back up and keep walking yes that's what you've got to do you got to keep walking now sorry now Paul when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus he says in a um he says in Galatians 1 and verse 11 let's just read this together Galatians 1:11 down to verse 19 he says but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation uh in times past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion uh above many my equals in my own Nation uh being more exceedingly jealous of the traditions of my father but when it pleased God hallelujah who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I may preach him uh among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up to the uh to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after 3 years I went up to to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days but the other Apostles saw I None save James the Lord's brother so he had an experience he met this pillar of light on the road to Damascus and then you know he was blinded he you know he went into Damascus he went to the street called straight amen then then ananas came and prayed for he received his side he was baptized received the Holy Ghost but after all this he spent he went down into Arabia for 3 years and he searched the Old Testament to see who was this one he met amen he began to search it out so he had a life-changing experience but then he searched in the scripture you know who who is this one and he began to see that Jehovah of the Old Testament Hallelujah the very God that said let there be light the very God that spoke to Abraham get you out of this country I'll give you another country I mean the same God that came and spoke to Moses out of a burning bush amen I've come down I've heard the cries of my people I've come down to deliver them the same one that spoke to Isaiah Jeremiah and all the prophets down he was the same one that that that Paul met on the road to Damascus and he began to see his experience matched the Bible and he began to see that truly Jesus Christ he was wounded for our transgression amen the chastisement our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed amen he saw that God there's no other savior God says in the book of Isaiah I am the only savior there's none beside me amen and then in the New Testament who's who who's who's the Savior Jesus Christ there's not two different gods there one God manifesting himself in different ways amen hallelujah he begin to see that his experience match God's Bible That's Right Hallelujah and I trust this is actually your experience amen when you begin to see this God you have met how many years ago I don't know could be this morning I pray it is if you haven't I me but you begin to see as you look into his word hallelujah that that that that same God that we that we enjoy and we love and we rejoice in this message that we have received amen it is God himself declaring himself Hallelujah I because that's what Paul saw he didn't just take it take an experience and run with it he he went into here and he read and he read three years remember he knew the scripture from a little child he probably could have quoted it standing right there on the road to Damascus from Genesis through to Malachi but he searched it in the Bible who's this one I met who's this pillar of light who says my name is Jesus Hallelujah that's right I trust it's the same thing with you will you go into the word and you begin to see your life amen you begin to see the life that lives out of you is in the scripture amen where Paul would speak about the fruits of the spirit amen and he and he and he says in Galatians 5 let's just do a bit of reading today if this is okay Galatians 5:16 that's incredible here you are God meets you and then you look into his Bible and you begin to see the life that's now manifesting out of you it's a very different life that it was before and you see it in the word hallelujah so what Paul writes on paper is manifested in you Hallelujah that's an incredible thing cuz no man you know can you can't manufacture you can try people can try and manufacture the life of God but when it really comes into someone that's right you with me I trust it means something to you amen amen Galatians 5:16 this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lust us against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another so uh ye cannot do the things that you would but if you would be led of the spirit you're not under the law Glory now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness rings and such like of which I tell you before as I've told you in the past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance against such there's no law and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts and if you walk in the spirit let us I mean if you live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desires of vain Glory uh provoking one another envying one another Hallelujah so I trust you can you can read when Paul is describing a Believer and you can actually say that's me amen amen and it's not my own human ability that does it it's a very different it's the spirit of God it's not me it's not me that liveth but Christ that liveth in me Hallelujah I trust you can say that's me he's writing about me he's talking about me he's describing me Hallelujah it should be that way that's right amen James 3 and10 down to verse 12 we're just going to do a bit of I love reading the Bible amen hallelujah these things are glorious amen because you say well I'm not matching up with then you just say Lord change me so I do match up it's not remember this is not a Reformation amen this is not a self-help seven steps to becoming a Christian there's you know it is a transformation by his spirit it's when you yield your will that you what is the prayer the model prayer Our Father which are in heaven Hallelujah you're saying I came out of you God you're my father you birthed me upon the Earth Our Father Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth on Earth amen onome Earth amen as it is in heaven amen give us this day our daily bread forgive us our trespasses we forgive them who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the power and the glory forever and ever amen that's the model prayer thy will Hallelujah after praising his name how great he is Father you're glorious amen Hallowed be thy name thy will be done not my will amen and we'll come into it later in the service I'm going to take a bit of a segue I'll just drop it in now there's power there's great power and humility there's incredible power and humility Hallelujah and if you want to stay on the narrow way humility will keep you there amen amen there's great power in it so James 3:10 out of the same mouth bre uh proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be does a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either of Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh he says it very clear you can't have both amen you'll either be one or the other but if you are the one you can become the other amen amen remember under the blood of Jesus Christ oh I'll go back to the old test Cain could not he could not be not made Cain the natural birth he had he was Cain he was religious he hated the truth that was just his nature you know he could not change balum could not change from being balum that's right cor and Dayan they could not change from being cor and Dayan Saul could not change from from not being Saul King Saul a mean his complexes took him off the took him off the path but he's still the son of God amen but under the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen Esau could not change from being Esau he was born Esau he had to remain Esau but under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why it says You must be born again so it doesn't matter what your first nature makes you amen but Jesus Christ Allelujah gives you a new nature gives you a new birth gives you a new amen so that means if it was in the Old Testament Esau could have been changed to Jacob amen Cain could have been changed to Abel Hallelujah Bam could been changed to Moses amen are you with me amen that's true to me that's true that's right so there's is there anything too hard for the lord well I have this nature I have this past I have this environment I was Raising I have all these scars and hurts and pains is there anything too hard for the Lord hallelujah I'm glad that's true am me brother Braham said in the sermon why in in Phoenix Phoenix and and in 61 he says I've always said I don't care whether my coat matches my trousers my tie matches my shirt I want my experience to match God's word that's what I want I want an experience like they had in the Bible and they had it so why can't we have it I I just like that question why can't we have it why would we take a substitute when the Pentecostal skies are full of genuine Holy Spirit see there's plenty of it amen you say well I'm just going to go down this way I just feel the same you know but I failed him too many times here's the Apostle Paul they drag Steven out out you know Outside The City Gate hold our coats Saul he Saul he becomes hold our coats we're going to kill this guy yeah sure let's do it holds the coats they they Stone Steven Steven's there they this not at their charge I see Heavens open Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of majesty on high you everyone's full of hatred wanting to kill the life of God that's in this man he's consenting to it and he doesn't just consent but he says now goes to the high priest so he sees the life of God on display this is what I'm trying to say he sees he sees the holy spirit manifesting in a man and then he says I'm going to wipe this out we've all made mistakes amen we've all stepped off the path at one time that didn't hold back the Apostle Paul amen he recognized hey I did do those things M I had them I I I found I I got it written from the high priest you know that I can put I can legally take people who believe in this Jesus and put them into prison amen I'm I'm going to wipe out this cult this was his this was his burden this was his this was his passion I'm going to wipe it out but then the grace of God when he revealed as we read when he revealed his son in me Hallelujah he said well we've all made mistakes Paul made mistakes that's right amen King David made a lot of mistakes don't let those things don't let well you we repent of things right and we should but don't let it your walk that's right amen well I should have done things a lot differently in life put it under the blood put it there Amen Let Go am walk on that's right you with me brother bam we see his life story rejected the call at 1933 to God the you know you know as an evangelist on the field turn down the call went to South Africa God told him exactly what where to go and what to do and he went with the ministers you know pressure came on he did wrong things he didn't let it hold him back he made mistakes cuz he was a man hello human beings how are we we're in that same category amen we can't let well if only I did things differently just put it under the blood thank you Lord amen God understands our human weakness he understands our human Frailty because he came one of us he was born into the Earth he experiences human weakness like we have human weakness amen he Jesus when when God became flesh he didn't become a robot it wasn't someone just acting things out being a robot he was a man amen he thought like us amen he experienced things like us he was rejected it says he was in Isaiah 53 he says he was acquainted with grief what does acquainted mean you not pretty good it's not just one one time meeting he was acquainted with grief amen he was only alive for 33 years upon the Earth but yet that short span he was acquainted with grief hello grief how are you today haven't seen you in a couple of weeks I'm not trying to be silly but this is he was acquainted they were friends they knew each other he he with me he had a hard life amen so he understands human weakness he was tempted on All Points yet without sin right so he had it you know he knows what it's like going from going through the teenage years he understand what it's like going from a child to becoming an adult he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to lose family well there's Joseph when he's born but where's Joseph when he's when you know his Foster dead where is he when he got goes to his ministry he's not there what happened he died amen there's a reason why he went to lazarus's tomb and wept cuz he knew what was like to leave you lose loved ones Hallelujah but this is a different burial Hallelujah Lazarus come forth amen amen but he wept because he felt he was sad himself so he knows what it's like that's right he knows what it's like to be made fun of he knows what it's like to be misunderstood amen you think of him as a 10-year-old boy they go to Jerusalem for the feast he doesn't look at all the stuff that 10-year-old boys what would they want to see I want to go see the Roman soldiers I want to go see the big castles and you know you want to see cool stuff where does he go he goes to the temple amen I know I've said these things before but you I trusted sink in he he goes to the temple he opens up the Bible and he begins to talk scripture with the priests 10 years old that's not a normal kind of 10-year-old that's right normal 10-year-old want to go play and do things and you know you want to be no but he was remember he was the word made flesh and so if that was how he was there he would have been that kind of way in the village and you know the kid that's always a bit different let's play run away from who whoever his name is that's right amen and sometimes you're on the receiving end of that game sometimes you're the ones playing the game amen he knew what it was like he knew what it was like to be rejected because he understand so he went through all that to understand your human weakness yeah I'm glad yes am amen but I want my experience to match God's Bible now he says in the same sermon like I said the other day the birth is a mess I don't care where you go if it's if it's um if it's in a pig pen it's a mess speak of a birth if it's in a Hast stack it's a mess or if it's in a pink decorated hospital room it's still a mess any kind of a birth and the new birth of the uh is a mess too it'll make a mess out of you but you'll certainly get new life and be a new creature when you receive it it'll make you do things that you wouldn't think you do yes sir it would make you get down there on the altar ball and cry and beat and confess all your sins it'll make you a different person out of you and then after that it'll make you act ridiculous to what you used to act why you know when people gets right with God never meets God anywhere they act ridiculous to what the old life was amen many of us wouldn't be I one would not be in this place amen and that is acting ridiculous to what I once was I'm glad for a new life Paul said the life I once lived and the life I now live it's a different one than the one he did live at one time look at Moses when he met God he was just with had all kinds of theology he was just as full as much as Carter has keys and I don't know what that means but what happened when he met God he was afraid to go in Egypt but the next morning we find him with his wife sitting uh straddle straddle a mule with a young on her hip bed hanging down about like this an old crooked stick in his hand just praising God going down to Egypt wasn't that ridiculous looking that's right he remember he had to flee the country cuz he killed an Egyptian he he fled now here he comes back as an 80-year old man that certainly looks ridiculous now someone say Moses where you going father Moses Rabbi Moses where you going what's the matter with you boy Moses says going down to Egypt to take over going right down to take over a one-man Invasion just like one man going to take over Russia why it sounds ridiculous but he was just happy and that bald head is shining that hair blowing back over his whiskers going down to take over why God said so and the beauty part of it was he did it amen that's the that's what's the matter with the church nowadays we've got to let God take over and get all the other stuff take it out and let God get a hold of you amen hallelujah now God himself I'm going to read this but God himself became a man to prove that the faith his Faith Works amen his faith works and he says he says uh in the same message he says now why take all the knowledge you got your head out lay it over to one side let God come in your heart he'll make something out of you make you act different be different and your Associates will be different all your whole life will be different everything will be changed when God comes into your life that's as certain as I know about him it'll change your life now when God got ready to try out his toxin which is actually he's not talking about poison he's talking about a medicine okay did you notice he'd never put it in a guinea pig he put it in himself any good doctor tries out his own medicine on himself first now God took it upon himself when God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the life of Christ Jesus being his son and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he took the toxin upon himself when he was baptized by John on the River Jordan John bear record seeing the spirit of God like a dove coming from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased it went into him the disciples and all watched him to see what he would do they watched his life to see how he would act to see what would take place we find him like there when he was under Temptation the toxin held when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane toxin held when he was spit on in his face toxin held when they nailed him to the cross the toxin held it was good amen hallelujah he proved that the medicine works amen that the faith God's own faith in a man works it was good it helped am Hallelujah so we'll hold in the hard time times it will hold in the good times it will hold in the times where you don't know where you're going where there seems to be no way it will hold amen it was good I just like that phrase I bolded it it was good Hallelujah and it's still good amen so Paul he lived by the faith of the Son of God and every believer down on through lives by the faith of the Son of God Amen you got to you got to say yes that's me amen don't say no it's not me you going to say yes that's me and if you do not have the faith of the Son of God you say God change my life take my life and make it thine amen now King David or David he was a man after God's Own Heart God told Samuel that he was that he has a man after his own heart that he's going to be made King now let's go to Psalms 119 I want to read a few a few uh extracts from the from the Psalms because because David he was he was A Gifted Man but God took and everyone is has a gift of some way right now but David the reason one of the reasons he was a man after God's Own Heart is because the gift in his life was because he didn't want it for a selfish motive he didn't use it for his own personal gain amen and every true s surrendered man or woman the gift that God has placed in their life they do not want it for their own gain amen because a gift a gift of you know faith is a gift I mean you say well I'm not gifted if you believe you you're actually gifted because you got a gift of faith Hallelujah but that gift is not to express you that gift is to express Jesus Christ amen amen so when so when David is writing the Psalms he's not writing words that he just plucks out from his mind and writes a song cuz it sounds neat it's actually Christ taking that gift and expressing himself through that man Hallelujah now Psalms 119 and 105 down to 112 now oh let's just read this now it says Thy Word as a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path I have sworn and I'll perform it that I will keep thy righteous judgments I am Afflicted very much Quicken me now this phrase comes a lot in the Psalms Quicken me oh Lord according unto Thy word except I beseech Thee the Free Will offerings of my mouth oh Jud um oh Lord and teach me thy judgments my soul is continually in my hand yet I do not for forget thy law the wicked have laid a snare for me yet I have heard not from thy precepts thy testimonies I like this thy testimonies have I taken as inheritage forever for they are the rejoicing of my heart hallelujah amen I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes always even unto the end so now this was David's desire but it's also God's desire being manifested through right because he wants us to be quickened according to his word a quickened to be made is to be made alive right and so this is the desire of his heart now Quicken Quicken here it means to live um but it also means um but part of the word also means uh to show so it mean so well I'll just read the definition for live it it means to live it also means to nourish up preserve restore to life am mean so when it means Quicken me to your word or make me alive it's not Natural Life he's talking about he's talking about super eternal life Hallelujah now King David now I'm just going to read a few now this is just from the psalm Psalm 71 and2 we'll see how quick brother arand is to throw them up Psalm 71 and 20 he uses this Quicken us or Quicken me quite a lot through the psalm and especially in Psalm 119 he said now we just need the one verse verse 20 Psalms 71 and 20 thou which has showed me great and sore trouble shall Quicken me again and shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth Psalms 1818 so will not we go back from thee Quicken us and we will call upon thy name Psalms 119:25 my soul cleaveth unto the dust Quicken thou me according to Thy word Psalms 11937 turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way this is this is the heart of a Believer make me alive to Thy word Quicken me to Thy word amen um Psalms 119: 40 behold I have longed after thy precepts Quicken me in thy righteousness Psalms 11988 Quicken me after thy loving kindness so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth amen Psalms 119 and 149 hear my voice according unto thy loving kindness oh Lord Quicken me according to thy judgment Psalms 11954 plead my cause and Deliver Me Quicken me according to Thy word Psalms 11956 great are thy Tender Mercies oh Lord Quicken me according to thy judgments Psalms 119 1559 quick uh consider how I love thy precepts Quicken me oh Lord according to thy loving kindness Psalms 143 and: 11 Quicken me oh lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble now he's not just is not vain repetition this is his heart's cry Quicken me to Thy word because he understands even in his own human desire he cannot keep the word of God Amen now this is just under the blood of bulls and goats but he has a desire Quicken me to your word make make your Word Alive to me this is desire Amen in times of trouble Quicken me to your judgment Hallelujah and it should be the same thing this should be our heart amen Quicken us remember the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen and the Son of God is his word right so it should be Quicken me make me alive to your word you following me this should be our heart's desire Lord make make your word a living reality Hallelujah don't just don't just let it sink in the into these however many inches of gray matter I have in here into my memory Quicken it down into my soul make it a part of me amen amen because how are you going to live unless you unless you're operating according to the word amen Paul remember Paul we read there in Galatians 3 years he went down to Arabia then he went to Jerusalem and then he speaks with Peter now Peter knew God after reality after walking with him you know in the days of his flesh then the Holy Spirit coming down upon him the Apostle Paul knew him by reality as well but could place it all in the scripture so when they were talking Peter would say something and then Paul would say oh that's written here and that's written here and that's written here and they begin to see that the same things they preaching they preaching the same thing because it was divine revelation amen hallelujah but Paul so they could see they were living by the the word the faith of the Son of God Amen so there should be a cry Quicken me to Thy word make it a living reality amen amen that's what it must be this word must become alive to us amen it can't just be excitement it can't just be what my family does it's got to become your own conviction that's right amen God is still looking for men and women boys and girls to express himself through he is searching for surrendered vessels people that do not have any interest in using the gift that God has given them for their own personal gain right now let's go to Numbers chapter 22 Paul could have become a very rich man he could have maybe become the next high priest he was there just like Moses he could have been the next Pharaoh he had half a foot on the throne of pharaoh I mean you know of Egypt he could have done it but he he forsook Egypt and followed Christ so he waited up remember so he waited up and he said I'd rather I'd rather follow this great Jehovah God that I just met into the desert through hardness and affliction and leading his people out to do his will then be the next Pharaoh am mean cuz he was living by the faith of God himself right and the same thing with Paul he could have probably been next been the next high priest he was a Pharisee of the fares he was the up and up here's this young man he's got so much potential look at what he could achieve but he met this the very God he was thinking he was worshiping he met so he forsook it all that he came to a place he writes to Timothy bring my I need my coat when you come bring my coat Winter's coming he had nothing he could have been a very rich man but here he was bring my coat why can't you get another one that's my coat I I can't afford another one he forsook all he could have just climbed the Ivory Tower like Gia sat there in Jerusalem and just taught other other people lived a life of just you know comfort and be well likeed by the celebrity rabbis of the of the nation but he forsook it because he didn't want to use the gift that he had in his life he he had influence before he met the Lord that's right am mean he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he had influence he would have been able to put the word together very well he would have had a very good argument amen he wasn't just um ignoramus before he met the Lord and then suddenly he knows all the scripture and can write the New Testament by placing placing the law and Grace correctly are you with me yes here because there was a gift in this life but he but when he met the Lord he surrendered that gift he surrendered all that he was cuz he didn't want it use it for personal gain but here's a man here's a man who's not in the same bracket Numbers 22 now I'm saying there's power and humility there's great power because if we can humble ourselves for the word of God then God can use us as he wants us to use us what is success in life what is success is it is it having all the money in the world is it having a great career is it having you know all these material things is that success no no no because when you die you leave it here and you go to another place you can't take it with you amen but real success cuz we got to think about eternal things because should the should the Earth go around the Sun a few more times half of us won't be here there'll be another generation upon the Earth and we'll remember Brother s sister son what a great blessing they were what a great testimony they were he the world continues on we eventually if the world goes long enough we'll all be in the grave amen I'm going to live forever I remember being at primary school and we would say the length of that yes we want to live with I want to live 1,275 years or something that's not going to happen 100 years 120 maybe what kind of quality of Life all you have going that far down the road and then what we'll all be in the ground our bodies will be in the ground and we'll be somewhere amen so what is what is real success in life I say success in life is doing the will of God Amen that is being successful because there'll come a day where he says well done my good and faithful servant enter in the joys of the Lord he doesn't say Well done what you think is well done my good and what you think is successful it's well done my good and faithful so whatever is committed into your hand just be faithful to what he's committed into your hand amen if it's to be a mom raise a children to be a dad right you with the family whatever it is just be faithful you say Well done my good and faithful servant amen amen amen well how do you how do you do that humble thyself amen you want to be lifted up Pride God remember God resists the proud he actively people who think yeah and this world is full of it look what we did look what I did look what I planned look what I strategized look what I've done the world is full of it you see those guys that just won the America's Cup look what we've done not taking away from the achievement but they're all like look how great we are yeah look at me that's not that's not real that's not humility look at the you know you know like the you know the soccer does when they score a goal and they just they're there doing their vict three things and all these people are worshiping them from the stands and the rugby any any sport cuz they like look at me I'm a God Amen you have people like Kanye West in his concerts he actually cries out I'm a God he believes he's a god upon the Earth that shouldn't shock you that's what they think they are yeah worship me look how great I am look what I've done no they haven't done anything they've given themselves to a spirit they've sold their gift and this is what they've got yeah and where's it going to take them but if we humble ourselves under the hand of the Lord we'll be raised up is this okay everyone's gone rather quiet maybe you're thinking a bit I trust there's a few cogs going on don't worry about Monday Monday will take care of itself that's right okay don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow will just happen and then you'll have Tuesday and it'll happen and Wednesday it'll happen Thursday I think much the same amen and and then we'll find ourselves back here again amen well how was the week it just happened hallelujah how was that stressing how did how'd that worry did it help you no why did you do it I don't know I can't help it don't worry about stuff I don't mean be laxed and just watch the world go by you just commit it all to God commit it all to the Lord and walk with him amen that's all you need to do amen now here's balum Numbers chapter 22 now humility now let's just read this numbers uh 228 and then we're going to read down to um bit of a lengthy reading down to verse 22 if you don't mind now here we are and he said unto them so the king of Moab has sent people to go hire balam who's a prophet to curse Israel because he knows that with their armies they cannot defeat Israel cuz Israel's already dealt with some other nations so he's getting a prophet he's going into religious Warfare and he's getting a prophet to use his gift to curse the enemy here we go so balam was a genuine Prophet amen he was a prophet but now here is the test now will you sell your gift will you take God's perfect will or will you take his permissive will cuz there's two amen you following me there's two there's a perfect will and there's a permissive will of God now and he said unto them Lodge here this night and I'll bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the prince of Moab Abode with balum and God said unto God came unto balam and said so here's a man who actually God speaks to him he speaks back God said unto balam what men are these with thee and balb said unto God uh balac the son of zapor King of Moab has sent me has sent unto me saying behold there's a people come out of Egypt that which cover the face of the Earth come now curse me then pray Adventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out now he's talking to the very God who brought them out of Egypt that's crazy isn't it think about it so here the God who actually has caused these people to be here he's actually trying to you know and God said unto balam Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balum Rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Bak get you into your land for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you that sounds good so far and the prince of Moab rose up and they went with went unto balac and said balam refuses to come with us and balac sent yet again princes more and more honorable than they so he's putting the pressure on here we go and they came to balum and they said to him thus sayith balac oh this sounds like Authority thus saith balac the son of zior let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from from coming unto me for I will promote thee unto uh unto very great honor and I will do whatsoever thou sayth unto me come therefore I pray thee curse me this people and balam answered and said unto the Servants of BAC if balac would give me this house his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God oh he's a Believer now to do less or more now therefore I pray you carry ye also here this night oh things are going sideways that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more hasn't he just had a conversation what did God say God didn't say it in a roundabout way he said who are these people what's going on you can't curse them do not go we just read it right um now therefore okay and God said verse 20 and God came unto balam at night and said unto him if the men came come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee Thou shalt do and balam Rose up in the morning and settled his ass and went with the princes of Moab and God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with them now we we're not just go read Numbers 22 to 25 that's your homework also go listen to does God ever change his mind mind about his word in 1965 in Jeffersonville that's your homework because it sounds like God is contradicting himself right but he's not he's allowing balum to go his permissive will right so his perfect will was do not go with them you cannot curse them because I have blessed them I'm actually the one that brought them out of Egypt do not go but his gift his life wasn't totally sold out so he still was thinking oh I could use this gift for great Advantage because remember Moab he sent more honorable princes the second time thus saith Bak you know now oh now comes this political kind of you know trying to lift them up oh here comes a greater delegation and then he and then see if he was totally sold out he would have said God's already spoken to me why have you come back God doesn't change his mind about his word what God says he says amen why why have you why have you come yeah go back I can't curse them God's blessed them God's doing this good luck to you by that's what he should have said but because his gift wasn't sold out his life wasn't totally sold out God could anoint him and use him and speak to him which he did but his whole heart wasn't given to God so God allowed him a prophet God allowed a prophet to step out of God's perfect will and step into his permissive will oh here we go Hallelujah now I'm not just trying to set something up here I want you to think about it if balum was humble to the word of God he would never have gone if he was truly humble how do I stay on this path stay humble amen and so now he takes God's permissive will but I want you to notice now God told him to go because he knew he was going to go but God didn't change his mind about what he originally said right and but because balam was had was a prophet but he wasn't one of God's children he let him go and he let him do what he did but then Jonah now God told him go go to Nineveh he didn't want to go I'm going to Tes God didn't let him go all the way God will Le us this is me here's God's perfect will our Humanity if it's not fully surrendered will take the easy way that's right cuz there is a perfect will and there's a permissive will but God will allow you to go down his permissive will to work out for his perfect will amen so here was Jonah now he's jumping on the ship to Tes this is God's permissive will but because he is one of God's children God didn't let him go to am mean God stopped him in the path you following me God stopped in the path he prepared a fish maybe I don't how many years before the storm came he was thrown into the sea Hallelujah but he let balum go all the way because he wasn't a true child of God but yet he had a he was a prophet think about it am amen but real humility if he was really humble to the word of God he would never have went amen God will permit you this is this is in does God ever change his mind about his word go listen to it whatever you do God will permit you to do something and even bless you in doing it but it still isn't his perfect will bam was blessed God anointed him that's right amen the things that he spoke are still true today whoever blesses thee Will Bless The whoever curses evil curs he speak of speak of Israel it was God speaking through him it wasn't his own ability God was speaking through them am me the things you go read Bam's three prophecies they still ringing true today but he went down God's permissive will so he was blessed amen he was blessed but it wasn't God's perfect will God he says God permitted Israel to take a law in Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had already given them a prophet Pillar of Fire sacrificed lamb a delivering power but they cried out for a law because they wanted to do something it wasn't God's will but it was injected because man wanted it and he was cursed by the very law that he wanted it's best to have God's will that's what he taught us thy will be done thy kingdom come thine will be done we must submit ourselves to his will and to his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it amen if you're looking for a loophole in the word you will find that Loop PA yes that's right amen don't but don't go looking that's right cuz God knows our hearts just take it the way it is so many wants to go around get some other way but when you do you find yourself going on you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in his perfect Divine will bam had a gift of faith and could have used it to the perfect original word of God he says many men on the field today with gifts of healing could do the same thing many men out there people speaking tongues people prophesying gift could use it for the kingdom but they don't and God blesses them anyhow gets the permissive will but for popularity and pleasures and personal gain they sold their birth rights as Esau did sold out to an organization sold out like balam did see and so many are doing today the same thing we know that's right notice as God said to him after he had heard the true cat decision the word don't go yes then he told him after he had seen in his heart what it was to do he gave him his permissive will so he said go and you can do the same thing if you don't want to walk in the truth you can go and have a great ministry certainly you can but you're taking his permissive will you're walking over his word he'll Prosper you certainly like he did Bam he was a success but he could could curse that people he couldn't do it cuz every time he started to curse he blessed since he couldn't do it but when he come to being um but then he came to being prosperous in his achievement he taught those people through ballic to commit adultery he brought it into the camp of Israel married them off he says why we're all one you worship the same God uh we've got a prophet up here you've got a prophet down there we have the same sacrifice the same Jehovah as our fathers why why not all just come and associate with us remember plague struck um Israel and God killed many of them thousands of them cuz he went on there his his permissive will so so balam was successful but he was going down God's permissive will amen if we are humble to the word true humility is a great power in the sight of God right if we can humble ourselves seek David King David he humbled himself this is me he humbled himself to the fact that he was called to become to to be king So when all through the fighting with Saul being on the run with you know all those different things he was able to stand there doesn't matter what was going on you read the Psalms it's not always happy he's not always rejoicing because he's in dire situations but he has confidence God is going to put me on the throne amen and he humbled himself to that calling in his life Hallelujah he didn't he could have killed Saul he didn't do anything about it he let God deal with it and God did deal with it when he was ready to step upon the throne doesn't humble thyself in 63 and sorry we're kind of going roundabout but he says now so to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has favor and power of God in it amen that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it see humility GED himself took a towel washed the disciples feet and wiped them the very God Of Heaven humiliated himself we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want their hi gr see the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like men don't want to see the same thing they don't want to get humiliated but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness I'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself Grace humbles itself greatness I've had the privilege of getting of meeting some great men and it's these guys that's got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket uh uh to Rattle that's the guy that thinks he's something when he's nothing but I stood with great men I mean great men with ragged sleeves cuffs and they make you think you're a great person see greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be uh I don't mean um I mean humble in spirit see I don't mean just don't get out and and go to wash and clean up you should do that you know that but I'm talking about humility genuine humility not something that's put on something that's real humility Jesus told us how to overcome he overcame now overcome means to stand the test that's right just like the old Saints did like Jesus did in the midst of all his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself by by the word said you destroy this Temple I raise it up in 3 days the word said so see and the presence of death he defeated it he defeated death in the presence of presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the Grave he overcame the grave why all by the word and humility Hallelujah and you see that in the the life of the Apostle Paul he says I don't come to you with great swelling words of man's Wisdom but I come in weakness and trembling amen because he because he was a truly humble man and this is how he operated by this is how he lived by the faith of the Son of God was by real humility yes I mean I believe when when he fell face down in the dirt on the road to Damascus amen not literally but figurative figuratively he stayed there amen he stayed in that way amen the life I now live amen it's no longer I that liveth but but Christ that liveth in me stayed humble and obedient to the word of God and that's how he was successful that's right amen and it must be the same thing with us amen amen we'll be tempted we'll be tried the devil will say can I take that gift and use it for my glory right and if you want your own personal gain you'll sell it amen but if you don't want no personal gain you want God to be glorified through you amen you wouldn't be able to sell it for the world you with me yes amen that's why we must bam did not reckon himself dead amen he did not reckon himself dead because he wanted to be wealthy he wanted to have a great name that's why he sold his gift amen but the Apostle Paul he said now you must reckon yourself dead but alive in Jesus Christ amen and so if we're to reckon ourselves Dead everything we humanly want selfishly it's got to be dead all of our own Ambitions has got to be dead you following me everything we want from our own self you the lust of the flesh as I said is not just some sexual thing it's now how can I P it to this guy amen CU this world is all about how can I how can I further me how can I enjoy all of the things that just panded to me you got to reckon Yourself Dead remember Christianity is a life of sacrifice amen it is a life of sacrifice so if we want to truly manifest him what did Jesus say you want to be my disciple deny yourself take up your cross and follow me so there has to be a denial of self you got to reckon Yourself Dead amen you got to reckon yourself when you meet him amen you follow don't just stare at me like um something on the wall That's sliding down amen but but when you really meet him you've got to reckon yourself I am dead my old self it's not me in this vessel I'm not here anymore I'm dead I mean brother Bram said if the if the life of Michelangelo was in me I'd do great masterpieces amen if the life of D Vinci was in me I'd do great things if I the life of John Diller in me you know I do certain things but if the life of Jesus Christ is in me I will do the works of Jesus Christ and two of us can't live in the same house one has to be dead for the other one to be alive Hallelujah that's how it has to be so if we live by the faith of the Son of God we cannot be alive amen this world remember if if the world can try and get this flesh to live again why does unforgiveness come in why does the devil L why does he try to push unforgiveness or bidness down down your throat because if he can you can't live by the faith of the Son of God anymore am mean cuz perfect faith comes with perfect forgiveness amen a root of buness can defile Paul Paul wrote about it amen so if that can happen then you know that's why the devil tries to push buness down he tries to allow bter experiences to happen and he tries to allow he that's why he works on your mind remember what happened last year remember how that person treated you there remember what happened with those Believers there and all this that happened am mean cuz he's trying to grow a bitterness in you you follow me and if you can dwell on that then you can't walk with God as we're meant to walk that's right Hallelujah but there's a bomb and Gilead amen as as Moses they came through the Red Sea they came to a bitter bitter spring of water amen and many Travelers I've said it before but many Travelers would have passed through that water and it was just bitter amen but there was a tree there God said to Moses cut down that tree throw it into the water and and it'll be made sweet amen amen God inspired the prophet cut down that tree throw it into the water that's the same thing with us everyone has bad experiences in life that's right life is full of TR life of man is few days and full of trouble right so we all have bad experiences but there's a differences that one person can have a bad experience and it's still bitter when they think about it but the other one they're inspired take the cross take that tree amen cut it down throw it into the experience it'll become sweet am me it won't be a busness in your memory anymore but you say praise God H you gave me the grace to forgive them thank you gave me the grace to overcome that thing to lay it down and move on Amen amen what are you going to do Hallelujah that's why he brings things in never look at that's why put your past under the blood walk on Amen walk on that's a terrible thing walk on amen that's all you have to do can we have some musicians to come otherwise I'll just keep standing here where some musicians to come amen you got to put it on remember we are walking we got to reckon ourselves dead that means your old life whatever you did in this flesh is dead it's not even attributed you know Abraham God told God told Abraham after Isaac was born take thy son thine only son take him sacrifice him on a mountain I'll show you now but you think in your mind well but actually Abraham had another son he had he had um ishma but he didn't that was Abraham that was Abraham that was the life he produced from his first birth amen that was what he produced from his first birth but now he's a new creature now because a Life represent a name represents a life amen so his name was changed representing now the life you're now living is not Abraham you're Abraham you're father of Nations amen hallelujah that's why God said take thy son Abraham I'm not talking to the old you the old you is dead you're a new creature in me hallelujah amen take take thy son thine only son and take him and sacrifice him there so God can look at a man under the blood of bulls and goats that way how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ amen that have been transformed by his Spirit how much more that oh but there's still the life I produced from my old nature no God doesn't remember it God doesn't see it God doesn't attribute it to you anymore it's dead that's right Hallelujah amen amen I want to let's just stand shall we the life you and your old life dead Lord I trust you do yes do don't let guilt hold you back friends I actually just want to sing I want to sing Crea in me a clean heart when you a right Spirit In Me amen so I just think about David right now you say well I've had a lot of bter things even last week it was a terrible week for me but under the blood of Jesus Christ whatever you do don't dwell on anything that's not of him it's not worth it people have treated me in a real bad way Let It Go remember job I know brother Bley
