[1:24] [Music]
[1:52] Welcome to church.
[1:54] So happy to be here to worship the Lord
[1:56] to praise him to
[1:59] just to how much I love
[2:01] &gt;&gt; and I actually love being able to play
[2:03] music as well. I was saying to someone
[2:05] the other day, you know, it's such a I I
[2:08] I've learned to appreciate over the
[2:10] years that okay, this is a personal
[2:12] testimony, but that I can just I can
[2:14] this hand can just play things that I
[2:16] don't have to think about and this hand
[2:17] can just do things I don't have to think
[2:19] about and I can just express and praise
[2:21] the Lord,
[2:23] you know. But we all have different
[2:24] talents that we can use to praise the
[2:26] Lord with. And it's a I think when you
[2:28] can with whatever you have, when you can
[2:29] give that to the Lord and worship. It
[2:31] might even be building something. You
[2:33] know, if you're if you're a good
[2:34] builder, you can build something and it
[2:36] when you're building it or you're doing
[2:37] something for the Lord, you can just
[2:39] feel like I'm worshiping the Lord. But I
[2:41] I I'm I really appreciate being able to
[2:44] praise and worship. Can I Is that right
[2:46] to say that? I just sometimes I sit here
[2:49] and I when I'm playing and I close my
[2:51] eyes and I think, man, this is so
[2:52] enjoyable. I can just I almost feel
[2:54] selfish especially like at like a big
[2:56] convention and it's like I'm so selfish
[2:58] I think man I'd love to worship the Lord
[3:00] with this song next so I just play it
[3:02] next you know and then meanwhile 300
[3:04] people have to sort of follow along but
[3:06] I mean we I mean we try and follow the
[3:10] leadership of the Holy Ghost in that but
[3:11] you know it's like you just yeah I I
[3:14] love worshiping the Lord and I love just
[3:16] being able to
[3:18] just
[3:20] do something and and acknowledgement of
[3:22] what he's done for me. So, let's stand
[3:23] this morning and just worship the Lord.
[3:25] And I believe you all love to worship
[3:26] the Lord, too, because the Lord's done
[3:29] so much for us. Let's just pray. Lord,
[3:31] we just love you so much, Lord. And we
[3:33] we thank you that we can praise and
[3:35] worship you this morning, Lord. We we um
[3:38] feel like the the the boy, Lord, that
[3:40] came to you with all he had was a few
[3:42] loaves and a few fish, Lord. Then he and
[3:44] and it seemed insignificant for Lord,
[3:47] what he had to offer you to what was
[3:49] needed, Lord. and and we feel the same
[3:52] this morning, Lord, for what all that
[3:53] you've done for us. We feel like it all
[3:55] we can do is praise and worship, Lord,
[3:57] but and just sing a little song back and
[3:59] we we realize the great price that you
[4:01] paid, Lord, but it comes from our heart,
[4:04] a heart of gratitude and a heart of
[4:06] worship, a heart of praise to you. And
[4:07] we we know that you can see that, Lord.
[4:09] So, we thank you that we can sing this
[4:11] morning as your word said, "Let
[4:13] everything that has breath praise the
[4:14] Lord, Lord." And we have breath. We want
[4:16] to praise you this morning, Lord, with
[4:18] all of our hearts, with all of our
[4:19] strength, with all of our might. We
[4:21] don't want the chairs to raise up and
[4:23] sing, Lord, in our place because we're
[4:25] not. But we want to sing and worship you
[4:26] this morning and praise you, Lord. May
[4:27] you bless the songs, bless the worship,

[35:45] sometimes I sow
[35:48] like an eagle to the sky.
[35:52] Among the peace my soul can be found
[36:00] with an unexpected
[36:02] song.
[36:04] It may drive me from the high.
[36:08] It may bring me low but it will never
[36:11] bring me down.
[36:17] I know the master of

[37:41] reminder, we're going to have a a um
[37:43] after lunch, we're going to have a brief
[37:44] uh meeting on camp, just what jobs need
[37:46] to be done and so on. And then also,
[37:48] just to keep you in the loop, we are
[37:50] rearranging things with Sunday school
[37:51] with brother Arman going with
[37:53] superintendent and the youth and all
[37:54] those things. So, those things are in
[37:55] motion. We're just kind of hammering out
[37:57] a few details of it. So, that's that's
[37:59] being taken care of, too. Okay. So,
[38:01] everyone good today? Everyone happy?
[38:04] Praise the Lord. Let's go to Ephesians
[38:05] chapter 4 this morning. Going to read um
[38:09] Ephesians oh what Ephesians 4 and 11 uh
[38:12] down to 16. Then we're going to go to
[38:14] Ecclesiastes and we're going to read one
[38:16] verse there.
[38:25] Okay. So says here now
[38:29] and he gave some apostles, some
[38:31] prophets, some evangelists, some pastors
[38:34] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[38:36] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[38:38] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[38:40] till we all come in the unity of the
[38:42] faith, and to the knowledge of the son
[38:44] of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[38:46] measure of the stature of the fullness
[38:48] of Christ, that we henceforth be no more
[38:51] children, tossed to and fro, and carried
[38:53] about with every wind of doctrine by
[38:55] slight of men and counting craftiness
[38:57] whereby they lie and wait to deceive,
[39:00] but speaking the truth in love, may grow
[39:02] up into him in all things which is
[39:04] ahead, even Christ, from whom the whole
[39:06] body join uh fitly joined together and
[39:09] compacted by that which every joint
[39:11] supplieth according to the effectual
[39:13] working in the measure of every part,
[39:15] maketh uh maketh increase of the body
[39:17] unto the edifying of itself in love.
[39:22] We're just going to read one more verse.
[39:23] This may seem uh contrary or no not
[39:27] contrary but may seem a bit negative but
[39:28] I just want I don't believe it's
[39:30] negative but I just want to put this in
[39:31] here for a bit of a context.
[39:32] Ecclesiastes 7:7 I heard brother Aaron
[39:34] McGaryi preach on this. He took it a
[39:36] different way. I'm going to take it a
[39:37] different way but um just very powerful
[39:40] scripture um I believe here in
[39:42] Ecclesiastes 7 and 7 says surely
[39:45] oppression maketh a wise man mad and a
[39:49] gift destroyth the heart. Amen. And so
[39:52] if you want to be remembered in prayer,
[39:53] I was going to go to prayer before we uh
[39:54] you can have your seats, but if you want
[39:56] to be remembered, you want to lift up
[39:57] your hand. We especially want to
[39:58] remember brother Phil who's in hospital.
[40:00] Amen. He's uh scheduled to have surgery
[40:01] on Wednesday. The mass in his stomach is
[40:03] growing quite rapidly. So remember him
[40:05] in prayer. If you have a need, just lift
[40:06] your hand up. Say, "Lord, remember me."
[40:08] But let's join our faith together in
[40:09] prayer and let's go before our great
[40:11] God. Almighty God, we're so thankful,
[40:13] Lord, we can come before your great
[40:15] presence this morning. Not by anything
[40:17] we have done, but by your blood. You've
[40:19] called us to come boldly into into your
[40:21] presence into the throne of grace. So
[40:23] Lord, I believe we're here in your
[40:24] presence. And I just ask, dear God, that
[40:26] as we've read your great word, Lord, we
[40:28] need you as always, the great author of
[40:29] the book to step forward. And Lord, may
[40:32] you speak uh may you anoint not just
[40:34] speaker, Lord, myself, but Lord, anoint
[40:36] everyone who's listening. And Lord, we
[40:38] just need you to come over and Lord,
[40:40] just take over our lives. May we step
[40:42] out of the way, dear God. You can step
[40:43] in and do what you want to do in this
[40:45] service. We're so thankful, Lord. we can
[40:47] yield ourselves unto the true and living
[40:49] God. And I just pray that you'd
[40:50] especially be with brother Phil there
[40:52] God in hospital. You see that mass is
[40:54] growing in his in in his stomach or in
[40:56] his in his stomach area, Lord. Uh quite
[40:59] rapidly, Father. He's had he's he's
[41:00] booked in for surgery on on on
[41:02] Wednesday. I just pray, dear God, you
[41:04] give him strength, Lord. May the peace
[41:06] of God that pass all understanding reign
[41:08] in his heart, Sister Blind's heart.
[41:09] Lord, I pray you'd just just anoint the
[41:12] surgeons, anoint the hospital, Father.
[41:14] Just take control, Father. you're in
[41:16] control of all these things. We commit
[41:17] it into your hands. Just praying, dear
[41:19] God, this thing would be removed,
[41:20] Father, that would never come back
[41:22] again. May you grant that in Jesus
[41:23] Christ's name. And Lord, you see the
[41:25] hands that have been raised up, Lord.
[41:26] You see the needs that we carry. Lord,
[41:28] the questions, the burdens, the
[41:30] problems, Lord, I pray, Lord, as your
[41:31] word goes forth, may those be lifted,
[41:33] Lord Jesus. May you touch every life.
[41:35] May healing come into everyone who's
[41:36] unwell, Father, not just here, but those
[41:38] who may be streaming, dear God. And may
[41:40] you be our portion this day. We love you
[41:42] so much. We thank you for this
[41:43] opportunity, Lord, in Jesus Christ's
[41:45] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[41:48] have your seats this morning. So, I want
[41:49] to speak about I want to speak about
[41:52] character
[41:53] uh today. Now, we read we read here in
[41:56] Ephesians uh chapter 4 where the apostle
[42:00] Paul would speak about the the you know
[42:03] the church and really all of our
[42:05] journey. They were all on a journey to
[42:07] to perfection. Now this perfection that
[42:09] the apostle Paul speaks about he's not
[42:11] talking about sinless perfection here
[42:12] because the blood of Jesus Christ makes
[42:14] us perfectly sinless. Right? So it's not
[42:17] about uh we need to uh the ministry is
[42:20] not here to make you sin uh perfectly
[42:22] sinless. Okay? That's not what the
[42:24] ministry does. That that is not what the
[42:25] apostle Paul is talking about. But he's
[42:27] talking about a maturity of a people.
[42:29] Amen. That we go from newborn babes in
[42:32] Christ. We learn to crawl goooo gaga. we
[42:34] fall over into all these things
[42:35] spiritually and but then we begin to
[42:37] walk and we begin to mature because he
[42:39] says that we' come into the image and
[42:41] you know until we come to the measure of
[42:43] the stature of the fullness of Christ I
[42:45] mean unto a perfect man now someone who
[42:48] is growing like children here teenagers
[42:50] you're imperfect adults because you're
[42:53] growing into what you're meant to be
[42:54] right but within you is life within you
[42:56] is potential to become the full stature
[42:59] of an adult that you're meant to be but
[43:01] in the meantime you're growing into that
[43:03] image then once Once you hit about 21,
[43:04] then then you begin to get old and you
[43:06] on your way to die. You get old, death
[43:08] sets and you begin to age. But we we're
[43:11] stepping into an eternal body where
[43:12] there's no death, right? But you see the
[43:14] thing is that that you know we are
[43:15] growing into this maturity. And so God
[43:18] would place gifts in the body that he
[43:20] would minister through to mature us,
[43:23] mold us and shape us by the word of God
[43:25] that would grow into this this this
[43:28] image here. Now,
[43:31] so this is where we're going today. This
[43:32] is very important. Amen. Cuz God is
[43:34] looking for character. He's looking for
[43:36] a people that he sees his word manifest
[43:38] through in its maturity. He's not
[43:41] looking for even I'd say gifted people.
[43:43] See many things in life it's the gift.
[43:45] People identify a person with the gift
[43:47] that they have and they say well the
[43:49] gift is the person. Actually the gift is
[43:51] not the person. A gift is just something
[43:53] that God deposited in them
[43:55] &gt;&gt; and and that but that's not them. And
[43:57] what happens is people will take their
[43:59] gift and they say but look at this gift
[44:01] I have. And they will and they will
[44:02] somehow that in their mind give some
[44:04] reasoning to to give them rigor room for
[44:07] deficiencies of their Christian
[44:08] character because they've got this gift.
[44:10] Now we can't God doesn't want people
[44:13] like that. He's not interested in our
[44:15] gift. He's interested in you and you the
[44:17] person being built into the image of his
[44:19] word. That's what he's interested in.
[44:21] Amen. God did not save us because we're
[44:23] gifted. God saved us because of which
[44:26] we're his children. Right? God called us
[44:28] because you're his son or daughter, not
[44:29] because you're gifted. So we we must be
[44:32] very careful that that we don't identify
[44:35] ourselves with our gift because a gift
[44:38] is actually not for you. It's for the
[44:39] people around you, right? It's not for
[44:41] you to use. But you see what happens is
[44:42] that man will use fallen man. You know,
[44:45] everyone's gifted
[44:47] &gt;&gt; and you don't receive a gift when you
[44:48] become a Christian. You already have
[44:50] that gift within you. But it takes the
[44:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost many times to
[44:53] bring it alive as God wants it to be.
[44:55] But even before that, it can operate.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You see, many people in the world are
[44:59] gifted. Many people you you you take all
[45:02] the superstars of this day they're
[45:04] gifted people right Elvis Presley was a
[45:08] very gifted man but what did he do with
[45:09] the gift right Taylor Swift is a very
[45:11] gifted songwriter all those things but
[45:13] what does she do what do these people do
[45:15] with the gift they have you know
[45:16] motivational speakers that are very
[45:18] powerful speakers that's a preaching
[45:19] gift but they're using it for their own
[45:21] ends you see so everyone is gifted even
[45:24] you know we could read it here you know
[45:25] it says uh in in Romans 11:29 for the
[45:28] gifts and calling of God are without
[45:30] repentance. So, in other words, that
[45:32] that the gift in your life and God
[45:34] calling you has got nothing to do with
[45:36] repentance. It's in there in the
[45:38] beginning,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; right? Because you'd think surely if um
[45:41] you know, if if if people are, you know,
[45:44] see God doesn't take gifts out of
[45:45] people's lives just cuz they refuse to
[45:47] follow him. You see, Elvis Presley
[45:49] learned to dance the way he did by
[45:50] seeing people anointed with the spirit
[45:52] of God, dancing in the spirit. And he
[45:54] was actually raised in where Pentecost
[45:56] was actually thriving. He was in temp
[45:58] meters. Brother Abraham knew his his
[46:00] pastor, knew his grandmother, and you
[46:02] know, he was raised in a godly
[46:03] atmosphere. And what he saw God moving,
[46:06] he took that, he didn't surrender, he
[46:08] didn't surrender his gift to God, but he
[46:10] took his gift and became a very rich,
[46:12] famous person, but he just he he just
[46:14] made a cheap copy out of what he saw the
[46:15] spirit of God do. And and see, I don't
[46:18] understand why people are against
[46:19] dancing in the spirit because God did it
[46:21] before the devil took it,
[46:22] &gt;&gt; right? So why why why swing the other
[46:25] way just because the devil's perverted
[46:26] something, right? God had dancing first.
[46:29] Just like everything God has first, the
[46:31] devil just takes it because he's not
[46:32] original. Right? But you see, so the
[46:34] gifts and calling of God are without
[46:35] repentance. They are within a person
[46:37] before they ever repent. Before they
[46:39] ever hear about the Lord, before they
[46:40] ever come to any contact with the Lord,
[46:43] it's within them. Now, it's up to them
[46:45] what they do with it. Now, I want to I I
[46:47] brought this scripture in here where it
[46:49] says, "Surely oppression maketh a wise
[46:51] man mad, and a gift destroyth the
[46:53] heart." Now I want to take the second
[46:55] part of that verse because a gift can
[46:56] actually destroy you. If that gift is
[46:59] not surrendered to the Lord and your
[47:00] heart is not surrendered to the Lord
[47:01] then that gift can actually destroy a
[47:03] person because they will reason within
[47:05] themselves but my gift is working. I'm
[47:07] getting results therefore I'm fine and
[47:10] it actually changes their thinking
[47:11] changes how their attitudes are changes
[47:13] how they their their perception of truth
[47:16] totally changes because they justify it
[47:18] by look at the gift I have.
[47:21] All right. Are we are we together this
[47:22] morning? Okay, we're just going to go
[47:24] through this because at the end of the
[47:25] day, Lord, I need your character.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Okay, that Lord, make me my like you.
[47:30] Like you take the prophet Balam for
[47:31] example. He was a genuine prophet of
[47:33] God. He had a genuine prophetic gift.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a madeup guy. He had a genuine
[47:39] gift. He knew how to contact God. And
[47:41] his prophecies in Numbers 22 to 25 are
[47:44] still being fulfilled today. And you
[47:46] can't throw it out because just cuz
[47:48] Balam said it, it was the word of God
[47:50] through a impure vessel, a false vessel.
[47:53] But the gift in his life was right. But
[47:55] you see his gift, his gift and how it
[47:58] worked actually destroyed his heart in
[48:00] terms of his his reasoning, his
[48:02] emotions. Everything was supercharged
[48:03] with I got to get the money, right? And
[48:06] so this is where he's on his way to go
[48:08] to the king of um go to the king of
[48:10] Moab. God's told him not to go and then
[48:12] God allows him to go and do his
[48:13] permissive will and say go. And then so
[48:16] there's this angel of the Lord that's
[48:17] trying to stop Balam from going and you
[48:19] know you know um and then and then it
[48:21] comes the point of their journey where
[48:23] where you know the donkeyy's going
[48:24] through between two walls here and the
[48:25] donkey sees the angel of the Lord with a
[48:27] sword drawn. Balam doesn't see it at
[48:28] this time and the donkey actually
[48:30] crashes into the wall cuz he it doesn't
[48:32] want to go forward anymore. And then
[48:33] Balam gets mad and starts beating this
[48:35] donkey and then and then the donkey god
[48:37] said you know the Bible says God opens
[48:38] its mouth and he begins to speak like a
[48:41] human, you know. And then they actually
[48:42] have an argument back and forth and then
[48:44] God opens Balam's eyes and he sees the
[48:47] angel of the Lord in front of him. What
[48:49] had happened is the gift in Balam's life
[48:51] had destroyed his heart because he was
[48:54] running by a gift and not by being
[48:55] subject to the word of God.
[48:58] Okay, Lord help us.
[49:01] Okay, so now
[49:04] this is such a thing. Now we talk about
[49:06] this here where where Paul would say
[49:08] until we come to uh unto this perfect
[49:10] man to the measure of the fullness of
[49:11] the I mean to the measure of the stature
[49:13] of the fullness of Christ. Now
[49:16] Peter would take this and he would
[49:18] expand upon this point here in in in
[49:20] second Peter. He says, "According as his
[49:22] divine power hath given unto us all
[49:24] things unto the uh that pertain unto
[49:26] life and godliness through the knowledge
[49:28] of him that has called us to virtue and
[49:30] glory, whereby we are given unto us
[49:32] exceeding great and precious promises,
[49:33] that by these we might be partakers of
[49:36] the divine nature, having escaped the
[49:37] corruption that's in the world through
[49:39] lust. And besides this, giving all
[49:41] diligence, add to your faith virtue, to
[49:43] your virtue knowledge, and knowledge
[49:44] temperance, and temperance, patience,
[49:46] and patience godliness, and to godliness
[49:48] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[49:49] kindness, charity. Right? This is the
[49:52] statue of the perfect man. So, for if
[49:54] these things be in you and abound, they
[49:56] um they make you that you shall neither
[49:58] be barren nor unfruitful in the
[49:59] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
[50:01] he that lackth these things is blind,
[50:03] and cannot see a far off, and has
[50:04] forgotten that he was purged from his
[50:06] old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren,
[50:08] give diligence to make your calling and
[50:09] election sure. For if you do these
[50:11] things, you shall never fall.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; So we have we are called to give all
[50:16] diligence to have all of these virtues
[50:17] in our life. Now it says it appears here
[50:20] like he's saying you've got to add these
[50:22] things. But it's when the Holy Ghost
[50:24] comes into your life, he adds these
[50:25] things. He matures you. He grows you. I
[50:28] mean, so when you're a newborn baby, for
[50:29] example, you have a lot of potential to
[50:31] run, but you can't run at the time,
[50:33] right? I've never seen a baby come out
[50:35] of the womb running, talking, uh, you
[50:37] know, reasoning, doing things straight
[50:39] away. Who's seen that? No. You come out,
[50:42] you're basically helpless. You got to be
[50:44] carried, fed, all these things. But
[50:45] within you is potential. Within you is
[50:48] attributes of life, right? And then as
[50:50] you grow, these these attributes mature.
[50:53] And then they become fully formed when
[50:54] you become an adult. Right? So when the
[50:56] Holy Ghost comes into you, then these
[50:59] these virtues are there, but they've got
[51:00] to mature. They've got to grow. Okay?
[51:02] This is this is what we need because
[51:04] many people Christendom in this day says
[51:06] the cross is your destination.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Calvary is not your destination. Glory
[51:11] is your destination. Calvary is the
[51:13] beginning of your walk.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Right? Calvary, you get to the cross,
[51:16] you got to get there. You've got to meet
[51:17] the Lord. You got to be surrendered. You
[51:19] got to He's got to change you. But you
[51:20] don't stop there. You keep growing.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Does that mean you throw the cross away?
[51:24] No. You take it with you. Right? But
[51:26] it's not your destination. It's the
[51:27] beginning of your journey. Okay? So our
[51:30] journey is to a full mature person. You
[51:32] know, we can't be lacking in any of
[51:34] these things. God pour these virtues
[51:36] into us. Amen. That we become fully
[51:39] mature because this is the age of
[51:40] maturity.
[51:42] Praise the Lord.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now because if you look at this
[51:47] now, this gift as I saying, Balam, Balam
[51:49] used his the gift in his life for his
[51:51] own ends.
[51:52] And unfortunately, this is what people
[51:55] do. Now it's amazing if you read in
[51:57] Ezekiel. Sorry, there's going to be a
[51:58] lot of reading today. We're just going
[51:59] to go on a journey through this, okay?
[52:01] Cuz I want this to sink in. So, if I'm
[52:02] not running and jumping and all these
[52:04] things, okay, we're okay, right? Don't
[52:08] fall asleep on me. Ezekiel 28:1-6. The
[52:10] word of the Lord came un um again unto
[52:12] me, saying, Son of man, say unto the
[52:14] king of Tyrus, thus sayeth the Lord God,
[52:16] because thine heart is lifted up, and
[52:18] thou hast said, I am God, I sit in the
[52:20] seat of God in the midst of the seas,
[52:22] yet thou art a man and not God, though
[52:24] thou set thine heart as the heart of
[52:26] God. So, here's a person. No, no, no,
[52:28] wait. We just read this next verse. It's
[52:30] so powerful. Behold, thou art wiser than
[52:32] Daniel. There is no secret that they can
[52:34] hide from thee. See, here's a man who's
[52:37] wiser than Daniel. That's quite a
[52:39] statement. That's quite a That's quite a
[52:41] thing for God to attribute to a man.
[52:43] You're wiser than my man. I placed in
[52:45] Babylon as a witness that he always
[52:47] turned to me and I showed him till the
[52:48] end time and I unfolded mysteries to him
[52:50] and I showed him what to do and I gave
[52:52] him wisdom to live in Babylon but not be
[52:54] part of it. you're wiser than him. But
[52:57] you see, this man did not use his gift
[53:00] like Daniel did because Daniel
[53:01] surrendered his whole life to the Lord
[53:04] before he left Jerusalem, right? He gave
[53:06] all that he was, Lord. Whatever I go,
[53:08] whatever happens, I'm your prisoner. I
[53:10] love you, Lord. I just want to serve
[53:12] you. I want to walk with you. That was
[53:13] Daniel's heart when him and Shadrach,
[53:15] Meshach, and Abednego left Jerusalem.
[53:18] But this man did not use his gift for
[53:21] God to be known. He used his gift to
[53:24] gather treasures, to become wealthy, you
[53:27] know, because of his wisdom. He says,
[53:28] "Look at this." He says, "Thou art wiser
[53:30] than Daniel. There's no secret that they
[53:31] can hide from thee. With thy wisdom and
[53:33] with thine understanding, thou hast
[53:35] gotten thee riches and has gotten thee
[53:37] gold and silver into thy treasures." So
[53:39] he used the gift in his life to build
[53:41] his own kingdom. And how many people, I
[53:44] hate to say it, how many ministers will
[53:45] build their own kingdom by with the gift
[53:47] of their life, they'll make the the
[53:49] instead of building the kingdom of God
[53:51] in a people, they'll build their own
[53:53] kingdom upon the earth.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; What a sad thing. But sadly, we see it
[53:57] around us. Why? Because that gift is
[53:59] there, but that gift is not surrendered.
[54:01] Amen. That person's life is not
[54:02] surrendered to the Lord, though they
[54:04] appear to be, but the fruits say
[54:06] otherwise. You see, so we must never
[54:08] ever use a gift in our life for our own
[54:10] personal gain. Yeah.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; No. The gift in your life is for me.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And the gift in my life is for you.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Right. We're here for one another. It's
[54:19] not for yourself, for what you can get.
[54:20] It's what the Lord can use through you
[54:23] and how God has made you to minister to
[54:25] the body to edify the body in love.
[54:27] Right? Amen. Every joint supplies. What
[54:30] is that? Every gift is operating helping
[54:32] one another.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're all we're all gifted. You say,
[54:34] "Well, I can't preach. I can't sing. I
[54:36] can't play. I can't do this." You've got
[54:38] a gift of faith. Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You have a gift of faith. Amen. God has
[54:43] made you gifted. You can help behind the
[54:45] scenes. You can be a very important part
[54:46] of the body that's never seen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like my vital organs. You
[54:51] don't see them on the outside, do you?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Yet, my heart is pumping. My lungs are
[54:55] contracting. The diaphragm's moving. All
[54:57] the things are going on that they should
[54:58] be. You never see those parts. They're
[55:00] called vital organs for a reason.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; I can lose a finger. I can't lose my
[55:05] heart.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Right? I need my brain. I can lose a
[55:08] thumb. I need my brain. I can lose a
[55:09] limb, but I need my brain. You lose your
[55:11] brain, well, you're dead, right? It's a
[55:13] vital organ. You don't see it on the
[55:15] outside. So, every part, everyone here
[55:18] has a part of the body, seen or unseen.
[55:20] The unseen parts are more important than
[55:22] the scene. Amen. The unseen parts are
[55:24] more important than the seen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Than even the ones on the
[55:28] platform. The unseen gifts are more
[55:31] important. Why do we diminish them?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; They're vital organs. Your vital organs
[55:35] if you're not seen.
[55:37] Hallelujah.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we all have a gift that God
[55:40] wants to use. But you see this one
[55:42] because of his wisdom and understanding
[55:44] had gathered treasures, had gathered all
[55:46] these things. But you see, he has set
[55:48] his heart as the heart of God. I say his
[55:50] gift destroyed his heart. Cuz someone
[55:53] who thinks they're God, they think
[55:54] they're the absolute. They think they
[55:55] can't be corrected. They think they're
[55:57] above everyone. They're without peer.
[55:59] They, you know, they would never ask for
[56:00] help. They never asked to be guided.
[56:02] They're not teachable because they've
[56:05] got it all together. God help us. We
[56:07] never get to that place at any part of
[56:09] our lives that we think, "I've got it
[56:11] all susted." No. The only one who's got
[56:13] it all sorted out is the Lord Jesus
[56:15] Christ. Amen. So, we can't say, "Well, I
[56:17] know all the mysteries. I know
[56:18] everything. Therefore, I've got it all
[56:19] sorted out. I'm fine." That person sets
[56:22] their heart as the heart of God. We all
[56:24] need more of him. We need more of his
[56:26] divine character.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:36] Even the, you know, even the enemy is
[56:38] not afraid to give out spiritual gifts.
[56:40] I got to know, I'm not against gifts.
[56:42] You know that, right? You know me well
[56:43] enough. I'm for gifts. Okay? So, when I
[56:45] say these things, oh, he's gone all. No,
[56:47] I'm for gifts. But God's got to use the
[56:50] gift and God's got to give the gift.
[56:51] See, because what happens is when people
[56:54] people have an inferiority complex, they
[56:56] feel they need to prove something and
[56:57] they feel that they need to push someone
[57:00] down to lift themselves up. you know,
[57:02] people. But but see, the Holy Ghost
[57:04] takes out those kind of things. Someone
[57:06] who feels like they need to be a big
[57:07] shot, need to push themselves forward so
[57:09] much is someone who actually needs the
[57:11] Lord because the brother because brother
[57:13] Bram says that the Holy Ghost takes out
[57:15] that big shot desire out of your life.
[57:17] You're happy to be anything. Like David
[57:19] said, I'll just be the doorkeeper in the
[57:20] house of the Lord. Amen. And and he that
[57:23] was David saying that, but that was his
[57:25] heart. He wasn't trying to be something
[57:26] great. Amen. He knew what God made him,
[57:28] knew where God took him from. And he was
[57:30] just happy to be part of the body. I'm
[57:32] glad just to be part of the family of
[57:33] God. Aren't you? Amen. It's the greatest
[57:35] privilege in all the world. And so what
[57:38] happens is, see, the devil will give
[57:40] temptations to make to make a uh, you
[57:43] know, to make a gift come into your
[57:44] life. He hands them out. He says, "Boy,
[57:48] uh, he got them here. Now watch this.
[57:50] This is watch when you get to the end
[57:52] where this temptation come." Amen. See,
[57:54] this is where um he says, "Maybe he
[57:56] might let you let some of you speak in
[57:58] tongues, think you got it." See, or he
[58:00] might even let you prophesy, though it
[58:02] not be with the word. I've seen people
[58:04] stand up and prophesy, which was
[58:05] contrary to the word, as yeast is from
[58:07] the west. See, it's the word that you
[58:09] live by. Them supernatural gifts, Satan
[58:11] can just hand them out by the handful.
[58:13] Certainly, that don't mean one thing.
[58:16] So, the enemy, you mean the enemy could
[58:18] come and anoint your life and and and
[58:19] give you those kind of things?
[58:20] Absolutely. Will it be true to the word?
[58:22] Absolutely not. But if the heart is I
[58:25] want to show them something, I want to
[58:26] be something, then the temptation can
[58:28] come in and the enemy can just hand them
[58:30] out by the handfuls. That's why friends,
[58:32] we got to take everything back to the
[58:33] word.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; We live, man shall not live by bread
[58:35] alone, but every word that proceeds out
[58:37] of the mouth of God. It is absolutely
[58:39] vital we take everything back to the
[58:40] scripture. We don't take it back to
[58:42] feelings. We're not led by our own
[58:43] hearts. Amen. A gift destroys the heart.
[58:45] Look at my gift. I can do whatever I
[58:47] want. No, you cannot. You look at the
[58:49] kings in second kings, even the godly
[58:51] ones, they get to a crossroads in their
[58:53] life. They're born, they become
[58:54] believers, they got good parents or
[58:56] whatever they do that which is right in
[58:58] the sight of the Lord and they get
[58:59] blessed and they get to a crossroads.
[59:02] Uzziah was one, Hezekiah was one.
[59:04] There's different ones. They get to this
[59:05] crossroads of life where they'll they'll
[59:07] either remain humble and God will keep
[59:09] blessing them or they get an attitude
[59:11] that they say, "Well, I can everything I
[59:13] touch will turn to gold. I can do
[59:14] whatever I want." And sadly, they get to
[59:17] that point and they always go off and
[59:18] say, "I can do what I want." And God has
[59:20] to deal with them. You go read the
[59:22] Kings.
[59:24] You say, "Well, that's the Kings. What
[59:25] about what about us? We can get to that
[59:27] point, too. I can do what? God's just
[59:30] been blessing me and I can just cuz I
[59:31] feel this way and all the We got to
[59:33] subject everything to the word of God.
[59:35] We must keep everything. Lord, is this
[59:36] according to your word? Not according to
[59:38] my feelings, not according to what
[59:40] everyone is saying, but according to the
[59:41] word." Cuz I never want to get to a
[59:43] point where I think, you know, like
[59:44] Uzziah, he was lifted up in pride and he
[59:48] wanted to be a priest cuz God had
[59:49] blessed him and everything else. So why
[59:50] couldn't he offer incense before the
[59:52] Lord? He wasn't built for it,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; right? And then what happened? The the
[59:56] priest, a whole bunch of them came in
[59:57] say, "You're a good king, but you this
[59:59] is not your office." He says, "I'll do
[1:00:00] what I want." What do you think? Cuz he
[1:00:02] thought God had blessed him so much he
[1:00:04] could do what he pleased. May we just do
[1:00:06] that which pleases the father. Amen. May
[1:00:09] we always just be with that heart. Amen.
[1:00:11] Not with what we think we should do or
[1:00:13] what we can do. Amen. See, notice if
[1:00:16] Satan, See, he'll try a second scheme on
[1:00:18] getting you to disbelieve the word. Go
[1:00:20] to a seminary, he'll try the next
[1:00:21] scheme. What does that uh So, you want
[1:00:23] to be real careful. Just sit with
[1:00:24] another five minutes on this part. If
[1:00:26] you then he makes you a supernatural
[1:00:28] offer, I'm going to come back uh to all
[1:00:30] this just for closing. He makes See, if
[1:00:32] he can't tempt you away from the word,
[1:00:34] no, I'm going to um I'm going to stay
[1:00:35] with the word, then he'll give you a
[1:00:37] supernatural offer. He said, "I'll tell
[1:00:38] you what. You get up here and dive off
[1:00:41] the temple and and bring and bring back
[1:00:43] up. See, show the people that you can do
[1:00:45] something supernatural." It's about
[1:00:46] Jesus being tempted on the top of the
[1:00:48] temple. Throw yourself up. The angels
[1:00:50] will lift you up. Right? So, so that
[1:00:51] temptation was look, you do something.
[1:00:53] I'll give you the ability to do
[1:00:54] something supernatural that people will
[1:00:56] know you're a believer.
[1:00:59] We're not being a believer is not known
[1:01:00] by our gift.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; We're known by our character. By their
[1:01:04] fruits, you shall know them, right? Not
[1:01:06] by the gift or how charismatic they are
[1:01:08] or how they can sing or how polished
[1:01:10] they are or how good the preaching is.
[1:01:12] No, you're known by your character. I
[1:01:14] should be I pray known by my character.
[1:01:17] Right? So, we got to be we we must keep
[1:01:19] these things very much the forefront of
[1:01:22] our lives because if we let our gift if
[1:01:24] we let a gift rule our life then our
[1:01:26] then our right to heaven becomes
[1:01:28] transactional in the right that we feel
[1:01:30] we have a right to heaven because of
[1:01:32] what we have done.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Right? And this is what many will do.
[1:01:36] You know the you know the foolish virgin
[1:01:37] different ones will come before the
[1:01:39] Lord. So not the bride. This is not the
[1:01:40] bride here. This is this is the foolish
[1:01:42] virgin says not everyone that saith to
[1:01:43] me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom or
[1:01:45] rather this is the tears rather Lord
[1:01:47] Lord shall enter the into the kingdom of
[1:01:49] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:01:50] father which is in heaven. Many will say
[1:01:52] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:01:54] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:01:56] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:01:58] many wonderful works? Then I'll profess
[1:02:00] unto them I never knew you. Depart from
[1:02:02] me, ye that work iniquity. See, there's
[1:02:05] a people that will try and barter their
[1:02:06] way to heaven by what God has done in
[1:02:08] their life through the gift that's in
[1:02:10] them. Haven't we done this, Lord, and I
[1:02:12] believe this, Lord, and I did this, and
[1:02:14] I prophesied in your name. And he never
[1:02:15] says, you never did those things. He
[1:02:17] acknowledges, you know, by by him not
[1:02:19] saying, "No, this never happened." He's
[1:02:21] actually saying, "Yes, you did those
[1:02:22] things in my name, but I never knew you.
[1:02:25] You never became one with me. You did
[1:02:26] not have a true birth. I mean, you never
[1:02:29] fully surrendered your your life. If you
[1:02:31] just wanted to use the gift for your own
[1:02:32] ends,
[1:02:34] this may be a slog, but we're going to
[1:02:36] just keep walk through this thing, okay?
[1:02:37] Cuz I want you to think about I really
[1:02:38] pray this anchors into our hearts
[1:02:40] because what are we justifying our
[1:02:42] Christian walk by? You know, we say,
[1:02:44] "Well, I'm a Christian. Why? I surrender
[1:02:46] my life to the Lord." Good. Now, what is
[1:02:47] being produced in your life? What is
[1:02:49] being produced in my life? This is very
[1:02:51] much a at me sermon today. Okay. What
[1:02:54] character is being formed? Or are we
[1:02:55] just being molded into a culture of a
[1:02:57] church? Are we just being molded into an
[1:02:59] identity of a false message culture? Or
[1:03:01] is God making putting these virtues in
[1:03:04] us? Is he is he is he maturing us? I
[1:03:06] mean, is he molding us? And I'll get to
[1:03:08] them soon. I'll go over them. But you
[1:03:09] know, what is being formed in us? What's
[1:03:12] being formed in me?
[1:03:15] Praise the Lord. You see, but it all
[1:03:17] depends. It all depends really how how
[1:03:20] we hear the word. Okay? because if it's
[1:03:22] just intellectual, it's not going to do
[1:03:24] us any any good. Now, this is from the
[1:03:27] church age book and uh once again, sorry
[1:03:29] for the reading, but I feel this is
[1:03:30] important. This to the Sardisian age,
[1:03:32] but this is speaks um to us as well. He
[1:03:35] says, "Remember therefore how thou hast
[1:03:36] received and heard, hold fast and
[1:03:38] repent. Uh if therefore thou um thou
[1:03:42] shalt not watch, I'll come on thee as a
[1:03:44] thief, and thou shalt not know what hour
[1:03:47] I will come upon thee." I want to read
[1:03:49] another translation, the West um
[1:03:51] translation of this verse. But
[1:03:52] remembering therefore, in what way you
[1:03:54] have received the truth as a permanent
[1:03:56] deposit and what way you have heard it
[1:04:00] and be safeguarding it and have a change
[1:04:02] of mind at once. It is very evident from
[1:04:04] this verse that God has given them truth
[1:04:07] as a permanent deposit. It was received
[1:04:09] and irrevocably theirs. It now remains
[1:04:11] to be seen what they will do with it,
[1:04:13] whether they will regard it or not. And
[1:04:16] that is true. They have just been given
[1:04:18] the basic truth of the whole gospel. The
[1:04:21] just shall live by faith. Salvation is
[1:04:22] of the Lord. They had heard the truth of
[1:04:25] the Bible which cast down the doctrines
[1:04:27] of Rome and set at not all papal
[1:04:29] authority. They knew the truth that the
[1:04:31] church does not save. They understood
[1:04:33] the Lord's supper. They had light on
[1:04:35] water baptism. They put out all the
[1:04:37] images truth. Why there was never was an
[1:04:39] age with any more men with so much light
[1:04:41] to shed. They had enough illumination to
[1:04:44] completely overhaul the old system or
[1:04:46] start out fresh and let God lead them
[1:04:48] line upon line and precept upon precept.
[1:04:51] What an opportunity. What an incredible
[1:04:54] opportunity. And I feel we are in the
[1:04:56] same boat, right? How much light has
[1:05:00] been shed in this day. Amen. The word
[1:05:02] has come open. The seals revealed. The
[1:05:04] book of redemption has come open to us.
[1:05:06] There's never been an age like this age.
[1:05:07] So much truth has flooded into this age.
[1:05:10] Amen. through a vindicated voice of a
[1:05:12] prophet, you know, thus sayith the Lord
[1:05:14] according to the scripture. We have so
[1:05:15] much light. I mean, so much truth, so
[1:05:18] much power has been released through the
[1:05:19] word. But how do we hear these things? I
[1:05:22] mean, they received the truth. They
[1:05:23] wanted and heard it. But the question
[1:05:24] was, how did they hear it? Did they hear
[1:05:26] it to build upon or was it with the same
[1:05:29] attitude that many Greeks had, thinking
[1:05:31] um something to discuss and theorize
[1:05:34] over? Amen. Evidently, the rich word of
[1:05:37] truth was being heard in an academic
[1:05:39] manner rather than for a practical
[1:05:41] outworking for God was demanding a
[1:05:43] change of mind concerning it. So every
[1:05:46] mystery has a practical outworking,
[1:05:48] right? We cannot now I'm not saying you
[1:05:50] like this. This is just to me. Sure. You
[1:05:52] know, but we can't hear the message in a
[1:05:55] in an academic manner. We can't put it
[1:05:57] together in some some thesis and does it
[1:06:00] make sense here and with reasoning and
[1:06:01] just you know the seven seals are not to
[1:06:04] theorize over. I mean the book of
[1:06:06] redemption Christ taking the title lead
[1:06:08] is not just a theorize over and argue
[1:06:10] about and just oh that's a nice idea. No
[1:06:12] there's a practical outworking that
[1:06:14] should come into our life that should
[1:06:16] transform us. Amen. And brother Bram
[1:06:18] condensed it so nicely in the breach
[1:06:19] message when he says Christ taking the
[1:06:22] book is the same as Boaz taking Ruth.
[1:06:24] Right? So Boa Boaz by his act of being a
[1:06:27] kinsman redeemer transformed Ruth from a
[1:06:30] Moabitete who was outside the promises
[1:06:32] of God out of the covenants of Israel by
[1:06:34] the law wasn't even allowed to come into
[1:06:36] the congregation but but Boaz by
[1:06:38] redeeming grace amen redeemed her
[1:06:41] because grace overrode the law brought
[1:06:43] her in amen into the promises of God
[1:06:46] that through her and Boaz Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] would eventually well the you be
[1:06:50] attributed to that lineage right but she
[1:06:52] was transformed by by an enemy and alien
[1:06:54] then without nothing a widow just
[1:06:56] surviving to become Mrs. Boaz of
[1:06:58] Bethlehem, a mighty woman of wealth. She
[1:07:01] was transformed by that act of
[1:07:02] redemption. Now, how much more now if if
[1:07:05] if if the book rep uh you know Ruth is a
[1:07:08] representation of the book, now you are
[1:07:10] that same representation. Amen. So the
[1:07:12] practical outworking should be the
[1:07:14] revelation of the seal should come into
[1:07:16] your life and should transform you
[1:07:18] should change you. Amen. Into what
[1:07:20] redemption is meant to produce. What is
[1:07:22] that? The statue of a perfect man. Amen.
[1:07:25] A fully mature Christian. Amen. that you
[1:07:27] know that you're part of Christ. Amen.
[1:07:29] You know you're part of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:30] You're not hoping you are. You know why?
[1:07:33] Cuz he's united himself with you and
[1:07:35] you're so happy to be identified with
[1:07:37] him. I mean, all you want is to be
[1:07:39] identified in him. You don't want to be
[1:07:40] identified in anything else. You're only
[1:07:42] interested in him.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't isn't that the practical
[1:07:46] outworking? Oh, but what about this? And
[1:07:48] when did this happen? No. What does it
[1:07:50] produce?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're not here to listen to the
[1:07:53] word in academic manner. I've sat in
[1:07:55] lectures. I sat in way too much
[1:07:57] university.
[1:07:58] Trust me, I was there way too long. Way
[1:08:01] too long. I've sat in lectures until I
[1:08:05] could put you to sleep
[1:08:08] with stuff that's just theory.
[1:08:12] I want So I'm not interested in theory.
[1:08:14] I'm not interested in just not
[1:08:16] conceptual ideas. If the word is just a
[1:08:18] concept, it's not a reality and it
[1:08:20] doesn't live. But if it becomes a
[1:08:21] reality, you will see it manifest in
[1:08:23] your life. And sadly, so many people of
[1:08:26] past, not past ages, but in this age
[1:08:28] with this message have left it as a
[1:08:30] concept because they're afraid humanly
[1:08:32] to surrender to it to let God transform
[1:08:35] them. Amen. The concept of the baptism
[1:08:37] of the Holy Ghost without sensation.
[1:08:38] Amen. But the manifestation of the works
[1:08:40] of Christ is not a concept. But many
[1:08:42] people keep it as a concept. Just become
[1:08:44] a good Christian and just be fit some
[1:08:46] message mold and sit like no. The
[1:08:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:08:49] sensation, you'll know you've met him
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; cuz he transforms your life. I mean,
[1:08:53] faith comes in. It's not intellectual
[1:08:55] faith. It's a revelation that comes in
[1:08:57] that builds the bottom of the image.
[1:08:58] Amen. And it transforms your life. You
[1:09:01] know you've met him. Because if the
[1:09:02] Bible says, "And you shall see me."
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "A little while, the world
[1:09:06] seeth me no more, but ye shall see me."
[1:09:08] He wasn't just speaking to the apostles.
[1:09:10] He was talking to you. And you know
[1:09:12] you're not part of the world. If you've
[1:09:13] seen him, you realize I'm not part of
[1:09:15] the world because the world doesn't see
[1:09:16] him. But if you've seen him, he's
[1:09:18] telling you you're part of me. Cuz
[1:09:20] there's no empty ground. You're either
[1:09:21] of the world or you're not of the world.
[1:09:23] And if you're not of the world, you see
[1:09:24] him. But if you don't see him, well,
[1:09:26] you're still in the world. So come out
[1:09:28] of it.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; See him. Amen. He says, "I will be with
[1:09:30] you even in you to the end of the
[1:09:32] world." He's not that that's just not
[1:09:34] nice language. That's the reality. He
[1:09:35] says, "I will be there.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:09:38] of the world." So it's what is it now?
[1:09:39] It's Christ comes in and he grows out.
[1:09:42] He matures. He takes the spirit man and
[1:09:44] he matures him into the full image of
[1:09:46] the word. Amen. Not some theory. That's
[1:09:50] right.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in theory.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; They can you take your theories and get
[1:09:54] theories help nobody.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, they are sincere working
[1:09:58] out theories." I'm not taking away their
[1:09:59] sincerity. But what about a practical
[1:10:01] outworking? What does it do for me? What
[1:10:05] can it do for you? That's what I'm
[1:10:07] interested in. I mean, that's why I
[1:10:08] wanted to preach these things this
[1:10:10] morning because I prayed to God that
[1:10:12] that this word becomes alive. It becomes
[1:10:15] personal. That when you read the seals,
[1:10:17] there's a practical outworking. What is
[1:10:19] the seventh seal? Christ redeeming his
[1:10:22] bride to restore Eden. Amen. That is the
[1:10:24] seventh seal. Amen. To get rid of the
[1:10:26] devil and get rid of sin, all these
[1:10:27] things. But it should be more than just
[1:10:29] a theory. It should be a reality. Why?
[1:10:31] Cuz he's put his hand on your life and
[1:10:34] he's changing you. Amen. He's met you.
[1:10:36] And he's no longer an idea. He's no
[1:10:38] longer even a prophet's voice. He
[1:10:39] becomes a living voice in your life. He
[1:10:42] changes you and you realize actually
[1:10:43] I've come under the influence of the
[1:10:46] seventh seal, Christ himself. my life is
[1:10:48] a living manifestation that I've come
[1:10:50] under his divine influence. Amen.
[1:10:52] Because what is grace? Grace if you look
[1:10:54] at the Bible um meaning part of it
[1:10:57] actually means a divine influence upon
[1:10:59] the life. I mean upon the heart and its
[1:11:01] reflection in the life. Amen. To someone
[1:11:04] who does not have a grace on their
[1:11:06] hearts that gift will destroy the heart.
[1:11:08] Amen. But if someone has a divine
[1:11:10] influence has has God himself grace upon
[1:11:13] their heart that heart will not be
[1:11:14] destroyed. The gift will not destroy the
[1:11:16] heart. actually know the gift will be
[1:11:18] used to build the heart.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To establish the hearts of the
[1:11:21] people.
[1:11:23] Praise the Lord. So we're not here for
[1:11:25] theory.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Not here for nice ideas. We're here that
[1:11:29] this word will become tangible and
[1:11:31] alive. What's its practical outworking?
[1:11:34] And I pray I always get to that. Where
[1:11:35] does the rubber hit the road? Where does
[1:11:37] this help me in my everyday life? What
[1:11:40] what has the seven trumpets got to do
[1:11:42] with me? You got to listen to those
[1:11:45] trumpets. And the last part of it,
[1:11:47] brother Bram says, is that feast of
[1:11:48] trumpets is calling Israel back to the
[1:11:50] atonement. And what is the message that
[1:11:53] what is the true message? The gospel
[1:11:54] trumpet done to you and I. We have
[1:11:56] recognize the atonement.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens when you first grace
[1:12:01] comes upon your life and you weep for
[1:12:02] your sins. You realize Jesus died for
[1:12:05] you. Amen. What's happening? The the
[1:12:06] gospel trumpet has come to you and
[1:12:08] you've been gathered not to Israel or
[1:12:10] land, but gathered back to your land,
[1:12:12] which is the word, back to Christ. Amen.
[1:12:14] And there's an affliction. And there's a
[1:12:15] mourning cuz you realize, Lord, my sin
[1:12:18] made you go to Calvary. Lord, my sin
[1:12:20] made you mad more than any other man.
[1:12:22] Lord, I did that to you. The Romans
[1:12:24] didn't do it. The Jews didn't do it. My
[1:12:25] sin did that to you, Lord. And there's
[1:12:27] an affliction and a mourning. Amen. But
[1:12:29] then what happens is the Lord comes
[1:12:30] says, "It's okay. That happened that
[1:12:32] your life would be saved." Amen. And
[1:12:34] then that seventh trumpet is the same as
[1:12:36] the seventh seal. It's, you know, Christ
[1:12:37] coming to the believer, right? But then
[1:12:39] after that, there's that feast of
[1:12:40] tabernacles. What's that? You're
[1:12:42] dwelling in a new habitation. Praise the
[1:12:45] Lord. So what happens is God calls you
[1:12:47] to transport you to a new new
[1:12:49] habitation.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Now to me that's not theory.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. I love it. Why?
[1:12:55] Because God has put all these things in
[1:12:57] the scripture say listen I've called you
[1:12:59] to to to carry you away. I've called you
[1:13:01] to change you. I've called you to build
[1:13:03] myself. I'm looking for myself in a
[1:13:05] people. I'm not looking for your
[1:13:07] humanity. I'm looking for myself in you.
[1:13:10] Amen. I'm looking for a mature person.
[1:13:12] Not in terms of because we all have
[1:13:14] different characters, right?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; We will perfection is not a flawless
[1:13:21] um what do you call it? A flawless um
[1:13:24] way all the time, never putting a foot
[1:13:27] wrong, never never having a bad day,
[1:13:29] never no that's not perfection. That
[1:13:32] that's something that that the devil's
[1:13:34] put in people's minds to re to to to get
[1:13:37] them to become discouraged to make them
[1:13:39] think they can never obtain it. How can
[1:13:41] you obtain something that doesn't exist?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Here's brother Brandham,
[1:13:48] mature son of God. Right. God
[1:13:51] demonstrated in his life what the cross
[1:13:53] should achieve. Amen. Right. There he
[1:13:56] was. The seals come open. What happened
[1:13:58] before the seals? The sword of the Lord
[1:13:59] came into his hand. He was adopted son
[1:14:01] of God. The word in his hand. The seals
[1:14:04] come open. What happens? People reject
[1:14:05] it. And he builds a complex. wants to
[1:14:08] become a hunter, a trapper in northern
[1:14:09] British Columbia.
[1:14:12] He had his moments. God said, "If you do
[1:14:14] that, your wife will leave you and
[1:14:15] you'll become a bum on the street." God
[1:14:18] brought him back,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; right? But you say, "Well, he's a he's
[1:14:21] an adopted son. There's no way he should
[1:14:22] have done those things." He was still in
[1:14:24] a body like this,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; but he was a mature son on the inside,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; right? Are are we all together here? So,
[1:14:32] so don't build some idea in your mind,
[1:14:34] well, if I really have the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:35] I'll never have a bad day. And if I
[1:14:37] really have the Holy Ghost, I'll never
[1:14:38] do something wrong and I'll never put a
[1:14:39] foot wrong. No, get those things out of
[1:14:41] your mind. You should be maturing.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So the things that's once ruled you, you
[1:14:45] should be ruling them
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; at least resisting it where before you
[1:14:48] just letting it rule in your life,
[1:14:50] right? Fighting those things
[1:14:51] withstanding. I mean, there should be a
[1:14:53] inside force pushing against the enemy,
[1:14:55] resisting. Amen. You see some people,
[1:14:57] there was brother um um it was brother
[1:15:00] Steven McNeely at the camp in Brisbane.
[1:15:02] You he like use the analogy people say
[1:15:04] they're resisting. is like someone who's
[1:15:06] got handcuffs and they just get in the
[1:15:07] police car. Oh, they're resisting. No,
[1:15:10] they're not resisting. They're
[1:15:10] complying. That's not resisting.
[1:15:12] Resisting is kicking, biting,
[1:15:14] headbutting. It's it's fighting, right?
[1:15:17] Yeah. I'm trying to fight. No, you just
[1:15:19] No. So, there should be an active fight
[1:15:20] in our lives. Satan, get under my feet.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Satan, this thing's not not going to
[1:15:24] rule me. This generational curses,
[1:15:27] they're not going to rule me. My first
[1:15:28] nature is not going to rule me. The Holy
[1:15:30] Ghost is going to rule me. Amen. There
[1:15:32] should be that desire. I trust there's a
[1:15:33] tenacity. There's such a fight. Amen. It
[1:15:35] doesn't matter how big you are. The size
[1:15:37] of the fight in the dog that matters.
[1:15:39] Amen. I remember brother Martin Top down
[1:15:42] in Christ Church. He said he had this
[1:15:43] corgi. This thing was wild. It would
[1:15:45] take on anything. But had a had a it had
[1:15:48] one move. Jump for the jugular and just
[1:15:50] rip.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Big dogs were scared of it cuz it was
[1:15:54] the size of the fight in the dog.
[1:15:57] How about you trust? You got a real
[1:15:59] tenacious Satan. You're not ruling in my
[1:16:01] life. Satan, you have no dominion here.
[1:16:04] You're not welcome. Oh, but you know, so
[1:16:08] we're ordained to it's it's it's not for
[1:16:11] a it's not to theorize over. Evidently,
[1:16:14] the rich word of God, I mean, it was
[1:16:16] heard in an academic manner rather in
[1:16:17] practical outworking for God was
[1:16:19] demanding a change in mind concerning
[1:16:21] it. Uh if this is the word of God, which
[1:16:24] indeed it is, then it must be obeyed.
[1:16:26] Failure to obey would bring judgment.
[1:16:28] When the guards of the sacred temple
[1:16:29] were found sleeping, they were beaten
[1:16:30] and the garments burned. Watch how the
[1:16:32] Lord do to those uh who in this age have
[1:16:34] relaxed their guard. So say Lord I want
[1:16:38] to grow. I want to be mature Lord. I
[1:16:40] don't want to I I never want to
[1:16:42] stagnate. I want Lord you to mold and
[1:16:45] shape my character. Now how we doing?
[1:16:46] We're doing okay.
[1:16:49] Amen. Even this even this here if I
[1:16:51] could jump back to this real quick
[1:16:53] before I move on.
[1:16:57] Says this here uh verse N. He that
[1:16:59] lackth these things is blind and cannot
[1:17:02] see a far off. Now this word blind it
[1:17:04] actually means to be uh uh it it's an
[1:17:07] opakqueness as if a you know like smoke
[1:17:10] around them. It's actually uh means to
[1:17:12] be enveloped with smoke. That is to be
[1:17:15] inflated with self conceit to be
[1:17:18] highminded be lifted up with pride to be
[1:17:20] proud. That word is used three times in
[1:17:22] the New Testament. It's to be it's to be
[1:17:24] blind. is to be proud and it's to be
[1:17:27] high-minded.
[1:17:29] So
[1:17:31] if we don't have these things, we'll
[1:17:32] become puffed up in our own conceit. But
[1:17:35] look how great, look at the influence I
[1:17:37] have. Look at my charisma. Look at where
[1:17:39] it's got me in life. That's being blind.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; But if you have these things you can
[1:17:45] see, you're not blind. Amen. You're not
[1:17:48] lifted up in your own conceit. Now,
[1:17:51] here's the I think brother Isaac had
[1:17:52] this image on Wednesday, but this is the
[1:17:54] image of what we call about the statue
[1:17:56] of the perfect man. So, so the first is
[1:17:59] so we're going to just go through these
[1:18:01] quickly before we close. Okay. Now, the
[1:18:04] first is faith.
[1:18:06] Faith has got to be a revelation. It's
[1:18:08] not intellectual faith. Faith is faith
[1:18:11] is when when that old suspicious
[1:18:13] doubting character is dead and he's a
[1:18:15] new creation. There must be a new birth
[1:18:17] to to be made into this image. Okay. So,
[1:18:21] so if you're a skeptic of the Bible, you
[1:18:23] know, a skeptic of the word being right,
[1:18:25] then you might well then you got to get
[1:18:26] rid of that. You got to let God put a
[1:18:28] revelation in your heart. I mean, not a
[1:18:31] not a hope so, but a no so. Amen.
[1:18:35] Because faith is not faith is not a
[1:18:37] hope. I mean, the enemy of faith is
[1:18:41] actually hope. Because hope doesn't just
[1:18:44] believe, but it brings in the
[1:18:45] conditions, the present condition of the
[1:18:47] person into the picture. That's what
[1:18:48] hope is. Because hope is an expectation
[1:18:51] but that hope is tied into but yeah but
[1:18:53] yes hope believes all of it but hope
[1:18:56] then says now I believe that God will
[1:18:57] heal but look at my condition. Faith
[1:19:00] doesn't look at condition. Faith doesn't
[1:19:02] look at circumstances. Faith does not
[1:19:04] look at anything the five senses
[1:19:06] declare. Faith just takes God at his
[1:19:08] word.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the greatest enemy faith
[1:19:11] has got is hope. Cuz it's a person
[1:19:12] becomes so hopeful to leave away from
[1:19:15] faith. Because hope is all about well
[1:19:17] this is it looks like it's getting
[1:19:18] better and this appears to be getting
[1:19:19] better and well yeah yeah well yesterday
[1:19:21] was good so today's going to be really
[1:19:22] good and you know they're looking at
[1:19:24] conditions.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; They're not looking at revelation. And
[1:19:27] that's why we should never look we don't
[1:19:28] walk by sight. We walk by faith. Amen.
[1:19:31] We don't look at we don't look at what
[1:19:32] we're going through or what someone oh
[1:19:34] they appear to be getting better. No.
[1:19:35] Get a revelation on that person. You get
[1:19:37] a re get a revelation for yourself on a
[1:19:40] matter. Amen. We don't go by our five
[1:19:43] senses, but we let God lead us. See you.
[1:19:45] See, when faith really takes a hold,
[1:19:47] nothing else stands. Amen. Because
[1:19:50] remember, Abraham got to a place where
[1:19:52] he was fully persuaded God was able to
[1:19:54] do it. Why? Because a faith struck his
[1:19:56] heart. Amen. That he wasn't guessing. He
[1:19:58] wasn't even hoping that he'd have Isaac.
[1:20:00] He knew. Amen. And so faith when it took
[1:20:03] a hold of his heart, nothing else stood
[1:20:06] in his life. If he didn't consider his
[1:20:08] own body dead, old, he didn't consider
[1:20:10] Sarah's condition, old and all these
[1:20:12] things, I have children. No, a faith
[1:20:14] anchored, we're going to have the
[1:20:15] promised son. Amen.
[1:20:19] Praise the Lord. And so faith is the
[1:20:22] foundation. So you're very blessed. If
[1:20:23] God has revealed to you the truth of the
[1:20:25] word, you're blessed. You got a good
[1:20:28] foundation.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Build everything on that foundation.
[1:20:30] Don't go off into man's opinions. And
[1:20:32] man's opinions can never be built upon
[1:20:34] faith. It can never do what faith can
[1:20:35] do. But a revelation of the word does
[1:20:38] everything.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith cometh by hearing
[1:20:42] and hearing by the word of God. That's
[1:20:43] why it's so important. If you're
[1:20:45] struggling, listen to the word.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Come to church. You've had a bad
[1:20:49] morning, come to church. You've had a
[1:20:50] bad week, come to church. Come and hear
[1:20:52] the word. Come into an atmosphere where
[1:20:54] God can minister.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be perfect people to
[1:20:57] come into those doors. We're actually
[1:20:58] very imperfect people. I speak about
[1:21:00] myself. You know, I come through with a
[1:21:02] lot of problems, troubles, personal
[1:21:04] things going, you know, in my own
[1:21:05] character. I'm fighting against
[1:21:06] whatever. But that doesn't keep me away
[1:21:08] from the house of God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; No, because God is molding and shaping
[1:21:11] us into his image. Amen. So, why?
[1:21:14] Because we're growing. Now, the next
[1:21:15] thing, the next thing is virtue. Now,
[1:21:18] that virtue is actually strength. Amen.
[1:21:21] Like Jesus when she was uh when when he
[1:21:23] was touched by the woman with the blood
[1:21:25] issue, she said, "If I just could touch
[1:21:26] the hem of his garment, I'll be made
[1:21:28] whole." Amen. So, so what happened? He
[1:21:30] stopped. He says, "So who touched me?"
[1:21:32] And Peter said, "But there's so many
[1:21:33] people touching you, Lord." Because he's
[1:21:34] in a throng of people. But he says, "But
[1:21:36] I perceive virtue has come out of me."
[1:21:39] Amen. So, so, so what happens is is is
[1:21:41] there's faith. Then there's got to be a
[1:21:43] strength, a virtue that comes in. A
[1:21:45] strength that you can give out. Brother
[1:21:47] Brand said it's like when he preached a
[1:21:48] sermon, Reverend Mr. Lily, that lily
[1:21:50] grows from the mud up into the water,
[1:21:52] opens its petals out, and what happens?
[1:21:54] The bees and things come along, take the
[1:21:56] nectar, take the pollen. What? It's
[1:21:57] giving out virtue. It's giving out
[1:22:00] strength. I mean, so there should be a
[1:22:02] supernatural virtue in our lives that
[1:22:04] when people come into our into our
[1:22:06] presence, they feel strengthened. They
[1:22:08] feel encouraged. They feel stabilized.
[1:22:09] What's that? That's virtue being given
[1:22:11] out. It's more than praying for someone
[1:22:14] and you feel weakened, which I have many
[1:22:15] times. That is part of it. But it's it
[1:22:18] should be when people come into our come
[1:22:19] into our homes, come into our lives,
[1:22:21] they feel strengthened. They feel
[1:22:23] better. Right? They've been troubled.
[1:22:25] They feel less trouble. And maybe you
[1:22:26] never spoke about what's going on in
[1:22:28] their life, but they just feel better.
[1:22:29] What's happened? There's a virtue
[1:22:31] flowing. Praise the Lord. There's a
[1:22:34] strength. Who's who's experienced that
[1:22:37] with believers, right? You go and meet
[1:22:39] them, you go talk to them, you have a
[1:22:40] coffee, whatever you do, and you just
[1:22:41] feel so much better afterwards. What
[1:22:42] happened? There's a supernatural virtues
[1:22:44] come out of that person.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I So, so you put that virtue in
[1:22:48] there. I mean, that's that's God
[1:22:50] building you up.
[1:22:52] And then of course the next thing that
[1:22:54] that that comes up is is knowledge.
[1:22:57] And that's not a worldly knowledge.
[1:22:59] That's not a scientific knowledge or
[1:23:02] some knowledge of man. That's actually
[1:23:03] knowledge to judge whether the word is
[1:23:05] right or wrong. That's so important.
[1:23:09] It's so important to know if the word is
[1:23:10] right or wrong. You add knowledge. Amen.
[1:23:12] Not not worldly knowledge. Amen. But you
[1:23:15] but you've got Christian knowledge with
[1:23:17] your virtue and faith. You judge whether
[1:23:18] the word is right or wrong. And if you
[1:23:20] can lay aside all your creeds and all
[1:23:22] your unbelief and everything you can
[1:23:23] claim that you've done, then you can
[1:23:24] have knowledge to believe that God
[1:23:26] cannot lie. Who's come to that place
[1:23:28] where you realize God can't lie?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; There's once upon a time you're running,
[1:23:32] yes, Lord, can you do it? I think you
[1:23:33] can. I don't know, Lord. But then just
[1:23:35] something comes into you or something
[1:23:36] grows out of you where you realize he
[1:23:39] can't lie. His word is true. The
[1:23:42] revelation he's dropped in my heart, he
[1:23:43] will perform it.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; It's already done in his economy, it's
[1:23:47] already done. I can just walk and
[1:23:48] rejoice. Why? Because now faith produces
[1:23:52] a knowledge cuz you're growing.
[1:23:56] Amen. I trust I trust you're in that
[1:23:58] boat. Well, yeah, but what about the
[1:23:59] circumstances? What about the problems?
[1:24:01] Can it really happen? God said it.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; God said it. Take it up with him. Amen.
[1:24:06] He's the one who gave the promise. He's
[1:24:07] the one who who's going to fulfill it.
[1:24:09] God said so so it's right. God cannot
[1:24:11] lie.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; God cannot tell a white lie. God cannot
[1:24:16] even embellish something that it appears
[1:24:17] to be wrong or you know he can't lie at
[1:24:19] all. I don't know how you describe it
[1:24:20] better but you know he can't subtly
[1:24:22] twist things and no what he says he
[1:24:24] means
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; and what he means he does.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] Let every man's be a lie and and and
[1:24:31] mine be true. What is that knowledge?
[1:24:33] You take people's opinions back to the
[1:24:35] scripture.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it true or not? Well, what does
[1:24:39] the word say? Who's ever had a
[1:24:41] conversation with someone and it's just
[1:24:42] like an alarm bell goes off? Yes.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And you can't quite put your finger on
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; what they've said wrong or something,
[1:24:49] but something just says this is wrong.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's knowledge.
[1:24:55] That's a protective mechanism God's put
[1:24:56] in your in your life by the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:59] That you can tell actually this is a
[1:25:00] shady guy. This is a shady deal.
[1:25:02] Something's not quite right. He's not
[1:25:03] telling the truth about you, Lord. And
[1:25:05] you can't put your finger. You can't go
[1:25:06] chapter and verse. Well, actually, but
[1:25:08] you know something's not right. And then
[1:25:10] you come to find out later you were
[1:25:12] right. That wasn't you. That was him.
[1:25:14] That was the Lord.
[1:25:16] Amen. Amen. That's supreme knowledge.
[1:25:19] Now you're getting knowledge. That's
[1:25:21] supreme knowledge. You don't have to
[1:25:22] have four degrees in some college or
[1:25:24] something like that to have it because
[1:25:25] all these virtues are given to you by
[1:25:27] God uh to place upon the foundation of
[1:25:29] your faith that you might come to the
[1:25:31] full stature of a real living man of
[1:25:33] God. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] Amen. When your knowledge is like his
[1:25:39] knowledge, I've come to do thy will, oh
[1:25:41] God. See, with the Father's word, he
[1:25:43] defeated every devil, heavens and earth
[1:25:44] will pass away, but the word will not
[1:25:46] see. When you've got that kind of a
[1:25:48] knowledge, it'll vulcanize with your
[1:25:50] faith. When something's vulcanized, they
[1:25:52] become one piece.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a chemical reaction between
[1:25:56] two bits of rubber by a sulfur compound
[1:25:58] and heat, by the way. You know, but you
[1:26:00] see, it actually joins them together.
[1:26:02] It's not like, you know, there's not two
[1:26:03] layers. It just becomes one whole thing.
[1:26:05] So, amen. Vulcanize that together. Now,
[1:26:09] now, now the next one's temperance.
[1:26:11] Now, temperance doesn't mean stop
[1:26:13] drinking alcohol here. Um, here either.
[1:26:16] No, no. Temperance doesn't mean
[1:26:17] alcoholic cure. Not in this case. This
[1:26:19] is Bible temperance. Holy Holy Spirit
[1:26:21] temperance. That's just one of the lusts
[1:26:23] of the flesh. But we're talking about
[1:26:24] Holy Spirit temperance. That means how
[1:26:26] to control your tongue, not be a tatler,
[1:26:29] how to how to control your temper, not
[1:26:31] fly off every time anybody speaks cross
[1:26:34] to you. That's temperance.
[1:26:38] Oh my.
[1:26:41] See, every construction is tested by
[1:26:44] when it's shaken,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; right? You could say how earthquake
[1:26:49] strengthen this building is on paper.
[1:26:52] Oh, it's a I don't know. But when the
[1:26:55] shaking happens,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; then you can see what the engineers
[1:26:59] claim it to be is actually manifested.
[1:27:01] Right? So, it's not it's not when
[1:27:03] there's no earthquake.
[1:27:05] You could build anything. Oh, this is
[1:27:06] 100. This this can stand a nine. Wait
[1:27:08] for that nine to come. You'll see if it
[1:27:10] stands. Right? So, so it's when
[1:27:11] something bad happens, when a shaking
[1:27:13] happens, you'll see if there's
[1:27:14] temperance or not. You'll see if there's
[1:27:16] patience or not or virtue. Right? So,
[1:27:18] it's a shaking. So, it's when bad things
[1:27:20] happen. When something unexpected
[1:27:22] happens, you just pull out your machine
[1:27:23] gun full automatic and I'm I'm going to
[1:27:26] give them a piece of my mind. You know,
[1:27:27] the problem is people give away so many
[1:27:29] pieces of their mind, they have no mind
[1:27:31] left.
[1:27:34] We shouldn't do that. Oh, I I've just
[1:27:36] got to I've really just got to tell
[1:27:38] them. Pray about it.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Pray. Oh, but that's so obvious that
[1:27:42] they're wrong. Do you have wisdom to
[1:27:44] help that person?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; See, oh, I'm just a perceiver. No, you
[1:27:47] can just be critical.
[1:27:50] A critical spirit is not a perceptive
[1:27:52] spirit because a perspect uh what? Yeah.
[1:27:56] Perceptive spirit. Thank you very much.
[1:27:58] God gives wisdom how to help that
[1:28:00] person,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes it's just being a
[1:28:03] buddy.
[1:28:05] Amen. It's not, well, this is wrong and
[1:28:07] X, Y, and Zed, and if you listen to
[1:28:08] this, you better do it otherwise. No.
[1:28:10] See, do we? What kind of control does
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost have over our tongue?
[1:28:17] Life and death is in the power of the
[1:28:18] tongue. Well, I just can't stop it
[1:28:20] running off. You get the Lord inside.
[1:28:22] You will.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will begin to mature you. You
[1:28:25] begin to realize, why didn't that thing
[1:28:26] just go full automatic on that person?
[1:28:28] You realize there's been a change in me.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you'll realize that's actually
[1:28:32] one of the greatest supernatural things
[1:28:33] you'll see. Actually, the greatest
[1:28:35] supernatural thing you'll ever see is a
[1:28:37] man or a woman fully subject to the
[1:28:39] whole word of God where it's not them
[1:28:41] trying to be the Christian, but God
[1:28:42] himself comes in and he lives this
[1:28:44] Christian life out of you. And you'll
[1:28:46] see them that their old nature doesn't
[1:28:48] rule them. Doesn't matter what situation
[1:28:50] they're in, but some and and they'll
[1:28:51] look back and they'll be more shocked
[1:28:53] than you. Why didn't I respond like I
[1:28:55] did a week ago? Why didn't I respond
[1:28:57] like cuz the same conditions happened a
[1:28:58] month ago and I just blasted them and
[1:29:00] Amen. They're still picking up body
[1:29:02] parts. You know what? Something's
[1:29:04] happened.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; God has come in in a greater way.
[1:29:10] Amen. Help us, Lord.
[1:29:14] Oh my boy. A lot of us get to fall off
[1:29:16] when we before we get started, don't we?
[1:29:18] See, then we wonder why God is not in
[1:29:19] his church doing miracles and things
[1:29:21] like they used to. Yes, sir. See, add
[1:29:23] these things. Add temperance to it. Oh
[1:29:25] temperance, how to answer in kindness
[1:29:27] when wrath is spoke to you?
[1:29:30] How's the temperance going?
[1:29:33] Amen. Well, no. I'm just going to
[1:29:34] respond in kind. You know, and I know
[1:29:36] this is me very much. We can be way too
[1:29:39] reactive.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not meant to be reactive
[1:29:44] according to what's coming our way.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; We should be reactive based on the word
[1:29:48] of God in our souls.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; This thing, him should be ruling how we
[1:29:53] react. Yes.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:29:58] Help us, Lord.
[1:30:03] When they said, "If thou be the son of
[1:30:05] God, turn these stones into bread." He
[1:30:06] could have done it and show he was God,
[1:30:09] but he had temperance. ought to be like
[1:30:11] Jesus. I mean, when they called him
[1:30:13] Beiel, he said, "I'll forgive you for
[1:30:15] it." That's right. They pulled handfuls
[1:30:16] of bed out of his face, spit in his
[1:30:18] face, and said, "Come down off the
[1:30:19] cross." He said, "Father, forgive them.
[1:30:21] They don't even know what they're doing.
[1:30:24] That's temperance. Who wants to be like
[1:30:26] Jesus?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Who wants to be like Jesus? And he
[1:30:29] didn't have to. He didn't put on a show.
[1:30:31] It was in his heart.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Then we come up to patience. I'm I'm
[1:30:39] going to wrap up soon. I promise. Says
[1:30:41] after that fourth, you want to add
[1:30:42] patience to your faith. If you got
[1:30:43] faith, it works patience. The Bible
[1:30:45] said. See, so this is patience. Now,
[1:30:48] that's the next thing is going to build
[1:30:49] this statue. You know, God has got real
[1:30:52] material in his building. Now, how short
[1:30:54] are we, brother, sister? See, why? Where
[1:30:55] are we at? See, yes, we uh we have glory
[1:30:58] and shouts and things because we've got
[1:31:00] faith. But when we come down to these
[1:31:02] things here, God can't build us into
[1:31:04] that stature. See, he can't he can't
[1:31:06] make us up to that kind of a place.
[1:31:08] We've got all these other things, we
[1:31:09] fall slide off of it. See, he can't
[1:31:12] build his church. Patience with what?
[1:31:14] What kind of patience? First thing is
[1:31:16] patience with God. Amen. And if you got
[1:31:18] real genuine faith, you'll have real
[1:31:20] genuine patience because faith workketh
[1:31:23] patience. And when God says anything,
[1:31:25] you believe it. That's all. You got
[1:31:27] patience. Who's got patience with the
[1:31:30] Lord?
[1:31:32] You're blessed.
[1:31:34] Lord, in your time, in his time, he
[1:31:36] makes all things beautiful in his time.
[1:31:39] Amen. Not our timetable. His.
[1:31:42] Oh, you know, the devil comes along. Oh,
[1:31:45] he hasn't answered his answered your
[1:31:46] prayer and you did this and you said
[1:31:48] this and you really felt like peace of
[1:31:49] God came and he answered. He'll answer
[1:31:51] in his time.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He's not an instant God. He's not a
[1:31:55] microwave God. Instant noodle kind of
[1:31:57] God.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; He's a slow cooker.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a pressure cooker,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; but it tastes better.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; We want instant, don't we? Why didn't it
[1:32:08] happen 5 seconds ago? This this is how
[1:32:10] we're conditioned by this world. But God
[1:32:12] wants us to have godly patience.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm I'm too high strong. God can
[1:32:19] give you patience.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm just I need everything all
[1:32:23] the time right now. God can give you
[1:32:24] patience.
[1:32:26] Amen. But then what else? Not just
[1:32:28] patience. It's actually to a degree it's
[1:32:30] actually easy to have patience with God
[1:32:33] because God was it but then to have
[1:32:34] patience with one another.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my God's God's agents in our life. I
[1:32:41] remember when the girls were first born,
[1:32:42] I thought, "Here's God's agent. Oh boy,
[1:32:45] he knows how to send the right agent
[1:32:48] because it shows you where your
[1:32:49] character's at." It's easy to be a
[1:32:51] Christian when there's no trouble.
[1:32:53] There's no one rubbing you the wrong
[1:32:54] way. You have no pressure. You got no
[1:32:56] problems. It's easy. Amen. Hey, if we
[1:32:59] lived at camp all the time, we would
[1:33:00] never grow.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We'd have a jubilee all the time.
[1:33:03] Probably pull some muscles dancing and
[1:33:05] shouting and rejoicing and lose our We'd
[1:33:07] probably never be able to speak to one
[1:33:08] another after a while. just be all hand
[1:33:09] signals. Why? Because we've been
[1:33:11] rejoicing all the time. You But we don't
[1:33:13] grow there. God comes down and does
[1:33:15] supernatural things, transforms lives.
[1:33:17] Absolutely. We need that time, right? We
[1:33:20] need those moments. We absolutely do.
[1:33:22] But it's when we go into everyday life
[1:33:24] now, God's going to praise the Lord.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; He has God's agent. See, God is so
[1:33:30] naturally supernatural. Natural thing,
[1:33:32] supernatural things going to appear very
[1:33:34] natural. You know, it's like, you know,
[1:33:36] you the Lord before they um, you know,
[1:33:38] went into Jerusalem for the Passover, he
[1:33:39] told his disciples, "Go to this place.
[1:33:41] You see this man doing this, he'll take
[1:33:43] you to the room." And it's just so and
[1:33:44] and they walk along and they find the
[1:33:46] person this way. It's just naturally
[1:33:48] supernatural. They're walking in the
[1:33:50] vision of the Lord Jesus, but they're
[1:33:52] just living everyday life.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about you and I, you know,
[1:33:55] we're walking the vision of the word?
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; I believe it. And then so now see we he
[1:34:02] says now speaking of Moses Moses had had
[1:34:05] had patience.
[1:34:08] He says then we got then he got into the
[1:34:10] wilderness. See it's about a 3 or 4 day
[1:34:12] journey from Egypt into the promised
[1:34:14] land. It's only 40 miles from where he
[1:34:15] crossed. But then right across they
[1:34:17] crossed again. But Moses in the
[1:34:18] wilderness waited 40 years. Patience.
[1:34:20] Amen. That's right. He waited 40 years.
[1:34:22] Oh yes sir. And we should have patience
[1:34:24] with one another too.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. See we get so much impatient with
[1:34:29] one another. We think we're uh we got to
[1:34:31] be like Moses. Moses had patience with
[1:34:33] the people. And you know how he had
[1:34:35] patience with the people is when God
[1:34:37] said, "I'm going to wipe them all off
[1:34:38] and start with you," he threw himself in
[1:34:40] the brereech.
[1:34:42] Can we be like that? That's a man under
[1:34:45] the blood of bulls and goats. How much
[1:34:46] more are people under the blood of Jesus
[1:34:47] Christ?
[1:34:51] Amen. He had patience with people that
[1:34:53] was rebelling against him.
[1:34:56] How about us?
[1:34:57] I just pray the Lord just do a surgery.
[1:35:01] I'm talking to myself too.
[1:35:05] Amen. Then then we have godliness.
[1:35:11] Amen. Add to your faith godliness. I'll
[1:35:13] be finished soon. Sorry if this is this
[1:35:14] is taking too long. So you start off
[1:35:16] from here with virtue. Then you go to
[1:35:17] knowledge. Then you go to temperance.
[1:35:18] Then you go to patience. Then you go on
[1:35:19] to godliness. Godliness. Oh my our time
[1:35:21] is getting away. Let's see. But you see
[1:35:23] what godliness meant. We uh we've s like
[1:35:26] Jesus. To be like Jesus on earth, I long
[1:35:28] to be like him. All through life's
[1:35:30] journey from earth to glory only asked
[1:35:31] to be like him. That's godliness. When
[1:35:34] he was smit on one side of the face, he
[1:35:36] turned the other. When he was spoken
[1:35:37] rough to, he didn't speak. He didn't
[1:35:39] roll back. See, godly always looking for
[1:35:41] one thing. I always do that which
[1:35:43] pleases the father. Yes, sir. Always.
[1:35:46] That's godliness. Amen. So if you want
[1:35:49] godliness, you should be able to look
[1:35:50] beyond how someone's treating you and
[1:35:53] look to their destination where you
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; you want to see them saved,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; right? That's how you always do that
[1:35:58] which pleases the father in my opinion.
[1:35:59] You follow the word of course, but
[1:36:01] what's your attitude towards one
[1:36:02] another? What's your attitude towards
[1:36:04] someone on the street who's not not even
[1:36:05] a Christian? I mean, we should be able
[1:36:08] to look beyond their complexes and how
[1:36:09] they react. Some people just live in a
[1:36:11] very angry state all the time. That's a
[1:36:14] complex. It's pains. It's hurts. It's
[1:36:16] insecurities. They're all reactive and
[1:36:17] fighting and bristling. We're about to
[1:36:19] look beyond that
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and look to their need. Look beyond the
[1:36:23] fault and see the need, can we not?
[1:36:25] Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And then what happens? Then you add
[1:36:29] brotherly kindness. All right. When we
[1:36:31] get to that brotherly kindness, put
[1:36:32] yourself in his place on the matter.
[1:36:34] Amen. Well, you say, "My brother sinned
[1:36:36] against me," said Peter. Shall I forgive
[1:36:38] him? He said, "Seven times a day." He
[1:36:40] said, "70* 7." See, brotherly kindness.
[1:36:42] Now you see if a brother is all out of
[1:36:44] tune, don't be impatient with him. No.
[1:36:46] See, be kind to him. See, as it says,
[1:36:50] brotherly kindness is to put yourself in
[1:36:51] his place on the matter. Try and walk in
[1:36:54] his shoes a bit. Then you'll understand
[1:36:56] that person better. Or we just looking
[1:36:58] at ourselves all the time.
[1:37:02] See, no. Be kind to him. Go anyhow.
[1:37:06] Somebody said not long ago, how can you
[1:37:08] believe all these things the way you do
[1:37:09] and still go to the assemblies of God,
[1:37:11] the oneness, all the rest. Then put see
[1:37:12] brotherly kindness. See hoping someday
[1:37:14] see patient with him. See temperant
[1:37:16] enduring with him. Knowledge to
[1:37:18] understand what he believes. Remember
[1:37:19] it's in his heart. That's what it is.
[1:37:21] Virtue in yourself to let it go out with
[1:37:24] kindness, meekness to him, having faith
[1:37:26] that someday God will bring him in.
[1:37:30] Amen.
[1:37:32] Then now what is the what is the
[1:37:34] headstone? Let's just what is the cap of
[1:37:36] this whole building? What runs the whole
[1:37:39] building of God? Divine love.
[1:37:43] Oh, how we need divine love in this day
[1:37:46] where love is such a real love is such a
[1:37:48] rare commodity. Even human love is such
[1:37:51] a rare commodity. We need divine love to
[1:37:53] rule our lives. What was the purpose of
[1:37:56] this message? That this would be built
[1:37:57] in all of us.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the message of Malachi
[1:38:00] 4. that man and woman will be built into
[1:38:03] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:38:05] As I said, when the Holy Ghost comes in,
[1:38:08] these virtues start growing, start
[1:38:10] maturing because many people got on
[1:38:12] their mind, well, we need all these
[1:38:13] virtues, so I need to perform a certain
[1:38:15] way, then I'll receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:17] That's not how Brother Bram taught it.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; No, the Holy Ghost comes in and then he
[1:38:21] grows these things.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I pray more than anything,
[1:38:24] Lord, I want to be a fully mature son of
[1:38:28] God.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians this morning.
[1:38:30] I'm going to leave it there. We could go
[1:38:32] on, but I just want you to I just pray I
[1:38:35] pray this is our prayer today. Lord,
[1:38:38] mature me, Lord.
[1:38:40] Search me, oh God. I don't want to try
[1:38:43] and justify my whole life by a gift.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be You're not looking
[1:38:48] for a gift, Lord. You're looking for a
[1:38:49] person.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; You're looking for people that you've
[1:38:51] molded into your image. That's what
[1:38:53] you're looking for, Lord. So, Lord, take
[1:38:55] me now, Lord. Take me up to the molding
[1:38:57] house. Mold these virtues into me, Lord.
[1:39:00] May they mature. May they grow. Who
[1:39:02] wants that this morning? Amen. Let's
[1:39:05] stand, shall we?
[1:39:09] Amen. Let's uh
[1:39:13] How about let's sing that song. Do you
[1:39:14] know that song? I want more of Jesus.
[1:39:16] More and more and more. I want more of
[1:39:18] Jesus than I ever had before. It's an
[1:39:20] oldie but a goodie.
[1:39:22] Okay, we know it. I want more of Jesus.
[1:39:28] More and more and more.
[1:39:32] I want more of Jesus than I've ever had
[1:39:38] before.
[1:39:40] I want more of his great love, so rich
[1:39:45] and full and free.
[1:39:48] I want more of Jesus so that he can have
[1:39:54] all of me.
[1:39:57] I want more of Jesus. Let's be a prayer.
[1:40:01] More and more and more.
[1:40:05] I want more of Jesus
[1:40:09] than I've ever had before.
[1:40:13] I want more of his great love, so rich
[1:40:18] and full and free.
[1:40:22] I want more of Jesus so he he can have
[1:40:27] all of me. Okay, maybe not.
[1:40:32] But isn't that I don't mean to be as a
[1:40:33] joke, but isn't that what you want? You
[1:40:35] want all of Jesus.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You don't want a lucky rabbit's foot or,
[1:40:38] you know, just some an errand boy. You
[1:40:40] want him to come and build his nature,
[1:40:42] his character, that you're a partaker of
[1:40:44] the divine nature. Amen. That's what
[1:40:47] he's looking for. He's not looking for
[1:40:48] people who have all the doctrine just
[1:40:50] right only. He's looking for people that
[1:40:53] he can see himself in. All those
[1:40:54] attributes are grown in them. Amen. So,
[1:40:58] let's bow our heads this morning. We're
[1:40:59] just going to pray and then I'll turn
[1:41:00] the service to you, brother Isaac. But I
[1:41:02] I know I've already asked you, but who
[1:41:04] wants to be made like him?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray, shall we? Oh Lord
[1:41:09] Jesus,
[1:41:10] so interesting to me, dear God, when uh
[1:41:13] the Apostle Peter would describe the
[1:41:16] perfect man, about being a partaker of
[1:41:19] the divine nature, and he would speak
[1:41:20] about faith and virtue and and and
[1:41:23] brotherly kindness and love and
[1:41:25] temperance and all these things, dear
[1:41:27] God, he didn't notice he didn't mention
[1:41:29] anything about spiritual gifts in there.
[1:41:32] He didn't mention anything about being
[1:41:34] able to preach or charisma or or be able
[1:41:36] to sing or play or anything like that,
[1:41:38] Lord. He's talking about virtues that
[1:41:40] that identify you and a person. And
[1:41:43] Lord, as we've just briefly gone through
[1:41:45] these things this morning, Lord, we can
[1:41:47] see where we need more of you, whether
[1:41:49] it's be temperance, Lord, virtue, faith,
[1:41:52] brotherly kindness, wherever it may be.
[1:41:54] Dear God, I pray, Father, that your
[1:41:56] great Holy Spirit would fill us all. May
[1:41:58] we mature. May we grow, dear God. That
[1:42:01] we can see these things living in our
[1:42:03] life, Lord. That it's not us trying to
[1:42:05] manufacture something. It's not us
[1:42:07] trying to reform ourselves, Lord. But
[1:42:09] Lord, we just want to fully surrender
[1:42:10] our lives into your hands, dear God.
[1:42:13] That you would mold us and shape us,
[1:42:15] Lord. Cuz this this is the kind of
[1:42:17] people you're coming to take away, Lord.
[1:42:19] those who are come unto a perfect man,
[1:42:22] not tossed to and fro by every wind of
[1:42:24] doctrine, not easily tripped up like
[1:42:26] that, but Lord, those who are mature,
[1:42:29] Lord, built in your image, dear God. So
[1:42:31] I pray, Father, that as we as we go into
[1:42:34] this week, Lord, as we continue to walk
[1:42:36] with you, mold us, Lord. Don't fill our
[1:42:38] heads, Lord, with information. Fill our
[1:42:41] hearts with your word, Lord. Father, may
[1:42:43] your word be so tangible, so real, a
[1:42:46] practical outworking. Father, that you
[1:42:48] would come live in our lives, dear God.
[1:42:50] We don't want to approach you in some
[1:42:52] academic manner. Oh, forbid it, Lord.
[1:42:54] Please, we want to come to you, Lord,
[1:42:56] that you can mold us and shape us, Lord.
[1:42:58] So, take us up to your potter's house
[1:43:00] just now. Mold us over, Father. Make us
[1:43:03] like you. Commit our lives into your
[1:43:05] hands, Lord. Just want to plead your
[1:43:06] blood over everyone here, those who may
[1:43:08] be listening, Lord, for your glory,
[1:43:09] Lord, that our hearts desire us, Lord.
[1:43:11] We want more of you, more of your
[1:43:13] character, Lord. Grant it, Father. We
[1:43:16] love you and we thank you, Lord, for
[1:43:17] this day in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:43:21] Amen. God bless you. And that's yours.
[1:43:25] Song, make me more like thee.
[1:43:28] Oh, make
[1:43:30] me more
[1:43:33] like thee.
[1:43:36] Jesus
[1:43:39] make
[1:43:41] me more
[1:43:43] like
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:50] give me a heart
[1:43:54] that's filled
[1:43:57] with love
[1:44:00] and make
[1:44:02] me more
[1:44:05] like thee.
[1:44:10] Oh yes. Make
[1:44:13] me go
[1:44:15] like thee.
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:19] Jesus
[1:44:22] made
[1:44:24] me more
[1:44:26] like thee.
[1:44:33] Give me a heart
[1:44:38] that's filled
[1:44:40] with love
[1:44:43] and make
[1:44:46] me more
[1:44:48] like thee. What about that song? To be
[1:44:51] like Jesus.
[1:44:53] To be like Jesus.
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] to be like Jesus.
[1:45:08] On earth I long
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:14] to be like him.
[1:45:21] All through life's journey
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:28] from earth to glory.
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:35] more than I am
[1:45:42] to be like him. I'm not sure we know
[1:45:46] that one.

[1:45:53] It's just about
[1:45:55] time.
[1:45:57] I can see my father standing at the
[1:46:02] door.
[1:46:05] This world has been a wilderness.
[1:46:09] I'm ready for delivering,
[1:46:13] but I've never been this one before.
[1:46:21] There's a light in the window.
[1:46:26] There's a table spread in splendor.
[1:46:30] Someone standing by the open door.
[1:46:37] I can't see the crystal river.

[1:46:49] before.

[1:47:44] to spread my wings for flying
[1:47:48] and I've never been this
[1:47:52] before.
[1:47:55] I see the bright light shine.
[1:47:59] It's just about all the time.
[1:48:03] I can't see my father standing at the
[1:48:08] door.
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:11] This world has been away.
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:15] I'm ready for

[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] I have heard the end time message
[1:48:31] as spoken by the prophet. He told me of
[1:48:37] my bride to love to show
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:43] how the king of glory honor
[1:48:47] has given me his promise
[1:48:51] and I'll never in this world

[1:49:01] It's just a battle.
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:06] I can't see my pro standing at the door.
[1:49:13] This world has been wild.
[1:49:17] I'm ready for deliverance.
[1:49:21] Lord, I've never been this.
[1:49:26] Oh, I see the bright light. I see the
[1:49:29] bright light.
[1:49:32] It's just a matter of time.
[1:49:37] I can't see my standing at all.
[1:49:44] This world's big.

[1:50:12] this world of sin.
[1:50:17] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[1:50:21] I've been born again.
[1:50:26] Hallelujah. I'm saved.
[1:50:30] Saved by his wonderful grace.
[1:50:36] I'm so glad that I found out he should
[1:50:40] bring me out and show me the way.
[1:50:46] For a long time my trouble
[1:50:50] [Applause]
[1:50:50] [Music]

[1:51:00] "Lord,
[1:51:04] then I heard about Jesus."
[1:51:09] What a wonderful hour.
[1:51:14] I'm so glad that I found out he would
[1:51:18] bring me out through his saving power.
[1:51:22] Thank God I am free. Thank God I am
[1:51:26] free. Free. Free from this world of sin.

[1:51:49] wonderful grace.

[1:52:17] sight.
[1:52:21] Like a for ship beggar
[1:52:25] that found fortune and fame.

[1:54:58] our salvation, Lord, and you set us
[1:55:00] free. And you said, "He whom the son
[1:55:02] sets free is free indeed." Lord, so we
[1:55:05] regardless of how we might trudge on
[1:55:07] through this life, Lord, we know that
[1:55:09] when I get to the end of the road, Lord,
[1:55:10] I won't have any trouble at the river.
