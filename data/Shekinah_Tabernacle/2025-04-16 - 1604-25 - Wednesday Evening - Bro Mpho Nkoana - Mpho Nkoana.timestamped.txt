[21:39] heavenly father,
[21:42] Lord, Father, these are very appropriate
[21:45] songs that we sing tonight.
[21:49] Lord, I pray that the
[21:51] spirit that is in these songs, oh God,
[21:54] and the words that have been said in
[21:57] these
[21:58] songs can be fulfilled and manifested in
[22:01] our
[22:02] lives. Heavenly Father, here we are
[22:05] tonight midweek service Lord for a
[22:09] prayer
[22:10] meeting. We thank you for bringing us
[22:12] here Lord and we appreciate it, Father.
[22:15] I pray that you bless your children,
[22:17] brothers and sisters of like precious
[22:19] faith that are here. Lord, may you bless
[22:22] those that are at home also and everyone
[22:26] else who is streaming with us tonight.
[22:28] May you bless
[22:29] them. Let this service be about you,
[22:33] Father. We pray that you just help us
[22:36] and undertake for us, Lord, according to
[22:38] your
[22:39] promises. For we ask these things, oh
[22:41] God, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[22:43] Christ. Amen.
[22:45] Amen. I wish that I wish you could put
[22:47] those words again,
[22:51] sister of that song. Can Can you just
[22:54] see that
[22:55] chorus? It says, "Lord, I give you my
[22:59] heart. I give you my
[23:03] soul. I live for you
[23:05] alone." Do you Do you hear that
[23:08] song? You hear that song, brothers and
[23:11] sisters?
[23:12] Every moment I am
[23:17] awake, every breath that I take. H those
[23:22] are deep
[23:23] words. Lord I have your way in me. In
[23:28] other words, Lord make
[23:30] me according to those words. If
[23:33] somewhere along the line I fail, let me
[23:37] live for you every breath that I take.
[23:39] Let's read our Bibles. Then I I don't
[23:41] tire you. Then we can sit down. We read
[23:44] in Revelation chapter
[23:47] one. Are you happy to be in the service
[23:50] musicians? Thank you so much, Josh and
[23:53] the team. That was very appropriate
[23:55] songs. And I I just felt I don't know
[23:58] about you, brother Kubin, but I felt
[24:01] that we can just continue in that line
[24:03] of worship, sing more songs and sing
[24:06] more songs until the spirit just come
[24:09] and pour in this place and then we go
[24:12] home. That's how I felt when I was
[24:14] sitting there when we were singing the
[24:16] songs. So, but uh we have to sing and
[24:20] then we have to read the word
[24:22] fortunately. Amen. But that was
[24:25] wonderful.
[24:26] Let's just read Revelation chapter
[24:29] one from verse 10 to
[24:35] 11. Chapter one.
[24:40] Yeah, I love my new Bible. I've got a
[24:42] new Bible. I love it very much. I don't
[24:45] know who how many of you loves your
[24:47] Bible, but this is my friend, my new
[24:50] one. I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[24:54] day.
[24:56] and heard behind me a great
[25:00] voice as of a
[25:03] trumpet. You know a trumpet talks about
[25:05] the message,
[25:07] right? Saying I am alpha and
[25:12] omega, the first and the
[25:15] last. and what thou seeest write in a
[25:19] book, and send it unto the seven
[25:22] churches, which are in Asia, unto
[25:26] Ephesus, and unto Smeirna, and unto
[25:30] Pergamos, and unto Thotira, and unto
[25:34] Sadis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto
[25:37] Laia. I feel just to bless the word of
[25:40] God again. Lord Jesus, we can never pray
[25:43] enough. Lord we ask you to bless your
[25:45] word. This word Lord we can read and
[25:49] open the Bible but father actually you
[25:53] are the one who will pour the spirit and
[25:55] inspire it for us to actually get the
[25:58] true meaning and the revelation of what
[26:01] it means to us. That is why father we
[26:04] pray and ask you Lord to please come
[26:06] father and help us. Come and speak to
[26:09] our hearts Lord and come and and comfort
[26:11] us. Come and encourage us Lord. Come and
[26:14] motivate us, Lord. Come and reveal more
[26:17] of yourself to us in your word, Father.
[26:20] That when we live here, we can see more
[26:22] of you, Lord. We can realize how much of
[26:26] your children we are. I pray, Father,
[26:28] that you also forgive us our wrongs,
[26:30] Lord. Our mistakes, Father. We are we
[26:33] are only human, Lord. So much
[26:35] susceptible to errors. And that is why
[26:38] father we want to ask you to forgive us
[26:40] just like Lord we want to forgive anyone
[26:43] who has wronged us. We
[26:45] unconditionally forgive anyone who is
[26:48] indeped to us even according to the
[26:50] Lord's prayer. Father we pray that you
[26:52] help us as we are in your presence and
[26:54] bless your children. We ask these things
[26:56] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:59] Amen. Please enjoy the comfort of your
[27:01] seats.
[27:03] And it was not supposed to be me
[27:05] tonight. It was supposed to be brother
[27:08] Jimmy and uh uh it was supposed to be
[27:12] brother Jimmy and then brother
[27:15] Jimmy it didn't make it so then it fell
[27:19] on me which
[27:21] was I don't know if it's unfortunate or
[27:25] forunate but uh I would like to speak to
[27:29] you tonight just for a few minutes I
[27:31] won't be it's just a few few few slides
[27:34] I promise you But I would like us to
[27:37] speak about God's
[27:40] rest. You know the rest of God. Because
[27:44] it is when we are in that
[27:46] rest that we are fully restored to our
[27:51] original
[27:53] form. You know before we were in this
[27:56] form there's a form that we
[27:58] were and that rest is the one that is
[28:02] restoring us to that one. Like brother
[28:05] Andy used to say in back to we are in
[28:08] anic condition. Remember him saying that
[28:12] you know those words I miss brother
[28:13] Andy's words. He'll say in an idianic
[28:16] condition. Just imagine how Noah when
[28:21] the animals came in the
[28:23] ark. Can you imagine all of a sudden the
[28:27] lion is very friendly to an impala and
[28:30] to a deer. Just imagine how what kind of
[28:34] atmosphere was there for the lion and
[28:39] the all the animals that are not
[28:41] friends. Now all of a sudden they
[28:43] walking together inside the ark. What
[28:45] kind of an environment was that one? It
[28:47] was that idenic condition and that's the
[28:50] one that we
[28:52] are not we are going to be we are right
[28:56] do you believe that? So we read about a
[29:00] man here. H the man who wrote this book
[29:03] was called John and I'm I'm going
[29:07] through the seven church ages. I've been
[29:09] chewing brother Ed you know like you
[29:11] like to say chewing on that fact. So I'm
[29:14] chewing on that seven church ages now
[29:15] for the last I don't know how long and
[29:17] I'm just taking it piece by piece by
[29:20] piece and just enjoying it. So I'm going
[29:22] to just talk to you from that from that
[29:25] message and just a portion about the
[29:28] patos vision you know but but but we
[29:30] want to speak about this rest now what
[29:33] inspired me the most is about this
[29:36] rest you know we are in this church is
[29:38] called what church is the seventh day
[29:40] Adventist or is this is the Sabbath is
[29:42] the the ones that observe Sabbath is the
[29:45] ones it's the
[29:47] ones so I must be careful But you see,
[29:52] you have been given the revelation of
[29:55] what the act Sabbath is.
[29:59] And that's what we are going to talk
[30:00] about tonight. Just to encourage you,
[30:02] brothers and sisters, particularly you
[30:04] young people. You
[30:06] see, okay, I I I'll talk to you now. Let
[30:10] me show you something. Let's
[30:14] read. Shall we read? Let's read Malachi.
[30:18] I want to take these three scriptures.
[30:20] the one that we read and the one that we
[30:22] are reading now and the one in Genesis
[30:24] just to try to tie them together to show
[30:26] you exactly what rest I'm talking about
[30:30] and what are you being restored to young
[30:33] people I want you to understand and to
[30:35] listen to me carefully parents also
[30:37] because you see parents it is our job it
[30:41] is our God-given responsibility to leave
[30:44] this message the message be in us so
[30:47] that we can be able to impart it to the
[30:49] young ones. It is our God-given duty for
[30:53] us not to just talk about it to leave it
[30:57] so that the children can be inspired. It
[31:00] can really even you know you can't give
[31:01] someone something you don't
[31:03] have. You can't you can't take $20 out
[31:07] of your pocket that you don't have and
[31:09] give me. You don't have it. So for me to
[31:12] give you $20 or share with you 10 from
[31:14] my 20 is because I have something that
[31:17] I'm sharing with you. So parents, it's
[31:19] our biggest
[31:20] responsibility not
[31:22] to I'm looking for a nice
[31:25] word not to play games with this message
[31:29] that that's I'm I'm hoping to be respect
[31:32] respectful but the seriousness of what
[31:35] I'm trying to say is that the young
[31:37] people have been given to
[31:39] us. This message has been given to us.
[31:43] Now we have to have the fruits of this
[31:46] message. So that the children can take
[31:49] those
[31:50] fruits those fruits inside they've got
[31:52] seeds when they plant them they bring
[31:55] more fruits that's the whole idea of
[31:57] what parents are supposed to but that's
[31:59] not what we are talking about here is
[32:00] the rest let's read
[32:03] Malachi am I yeah it says for chapter
[32:07] four you know the
[32:08] scripture it says for behold the day
[32:12] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[32:16] all the
[32:18] proud. Yeah. And all and all that do
[32:22] wickedly shall be shall be
[32:26] stumbled.
[32:28] And sorry, I think my glass has failed
[32:30] me when I read on this thing. I I'll do
[32:33] this. And that they come and and and and
[32:36] that the day that cometh shall burn them
[32:38] up, say the Lord of hosts, that it shall
[32:42] leave them neither root nor branch.
[32:46] Right. This is the day. Now, John speak
[32:49] about I was on the Lord's day. Did you
[32:52] hear him? He says he was on the Lord's
[32:55] day. He was in the spirit on the Lord's
[32:58] day. And then here again, we hearing
[33:00] here about h the day that is going to
[33:03] come. Now, let's go forward and hear
[33:06] about this day. Let's jump to oh well,
[33:10] let's just read verse 28. I didn't
[33:11] highlight it. But unto you, you that
[33:15] fear my name. You say, I
[33:19] unto I who
[33:22] fear the name of the Lord, the son of
[33:28] righteousness, the son of, you know,
[33:31] Abraham believed God and the Bible says
[33:33] it was imputed unto him as
[33:35] righteousness. So you are the son of
[33:38] righteousness. You who fear the name of
[33:40] the Lord, that son is going to shine
[33:43] unto you, right? A arise with healing.
[33:48] The son of righteousness arise with
[33:50] healing in his wings, and he shall go
[33:53] forth and grow up as calves of the
[33:57] storm. And he shall tread down the
[34:00] wicked, and they shall be ashes. That
[34:02] means this son of righteousness for the
[34:05] wicked there going to be ashes under
[34:08] your souls. The same
[34:13] son. I want to quickly jump to verse
[34:17] five. It says, "Behold, I will send you
[34:21] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[34:24] the
[34:25] great." You know when I say something
[34:27] great is good, right? It's awesome. It's
[34:30] big. before the great great to who? To
[34:34] you. Great and dreadful. You know what
[34:37] is
[34:38] dreadful? Dreadful. Horrible. Bad.
[34:43] Before the great and dreadful. So, it's
[34:45] going to be to do both
[34:46] things. Before the great and the
[34:48] dreadful day of the Lord. So, but Elijah
[34:53] has been sent, right? And he, this is
[34:57] what he's going to do. Elijah, he's
[34:59] going to turn the hearts of the fathers
[35:02] to the children and the hearts of the
[35:05] children to the fathers le I come and we
[35:09] know the whole verse. So in other words,
[35:10] it's going to restore us to our
[35:13] Pentecostal faith to our Pentecostal
[35:16] deeds to back the day in the day of
[35:19] Pentecost. That's where that's where
[35:21] this message is going to restore us back
[35:23] to. Why? Because God promised in the
[35:26] Bible, he said, "I will restore." And on
[35:30] the day, you know, I will he'll have a
[35:32] prophet like Moses. And that prophet
[35:35] came, which was referring to Jesus, he
[35:37] came after he he he left. Then the
[35:40] church started, the gentile church. And
[35:42] then God came by means of the Holy
[35:45] Spirit, and he anointed the children
[35:46] remember in the upper room. That's
[35:49] right. You remember now whatever they
[35:52] started there as the foundation of the
[35:54] church of the gentile because there God
[35:57] was opening for us was opening as the
[36:00] Gentiles closing the door for the
[36:02] Jews. Now we came in now along the way
[36:07] through the seven church ages we that
[36:10] that original was lost. Now we are going
[36:13] to be restored. But in the book of
[36:15] revelation, God says because that's the
[36:18] final final book and is going as
[36:21] according to 10 revelation 10:7 he
[36:25] says that that that great angel that is
[36:28] going to be that that was sent remember
[36:30] that angel when John was about to write
[36:33] and then he said no don't don't write
[36:36] just keep them and seal them remember so
[36:39] that now in the days of the voice of the
[36:41] seventh angel today they can be revealed
[36:44] Now what what it means is that who who
[36:47] to who are those things going to be
[36:49] revealed to us to you? So we are very
[36:51] very very very
[36:53] very important people to be alive here
[36:56] in this age today because God said he's
[37:00] going to send Malachi to restore and and
[37:03] to restore the heart of the children
[37:05] back to the father us to the back to our
[37:08] Pentecostal fathers to restore us. So
[37:10] now now here in revelation 10:7 we see
[37:13] that angel coming revealing all those
[37:16] mysteries and everything is known we in
[37:18] other words we are we are we know more
[37:21] and we know and we have received more
[37:23] than any other
[37:25] age so what we I I want you to
[37:27] understand the young people is that I'll
[37:31] tell you now let's quickly read Genesis
[37:35] and on the seventh day verse two chapter
[37:38] 2 verse2 and on the seventh day, God
[37:40] ended his work on the seventh.
[37:45] Are you with me? Yes, sir. On the
[37:47] seventh day, you know, back in Africa,
[37:49] when I preach or someone preach, if I
[37:51] hear that there's a there's a low volume
[37:54] of amens, I say, give me an amen there,
[37:56] brother. Can can somebody say amen? So,
[37:59] I don't want to do that.
[38:02] I But you see, on the seventh day,
[38:05] seventh day, is that the day of the
[38:08] Lord?
[38:10] On the seventh day, God rested. He ended
[38:13] up his work and then he rested on the
[38:17] seventh day. But now tell me can can how
[38:21] can God rest? Can God can God get
[38:24] tired? God can get tired. But the Bible
[38:28] says on the seventh day he rested.
[38:32] You'll you'll see. You'll see me now.
[38:34] Okay. You'll see me. Let's go back now.
[38:38] Now you see this man, he was there.
[38:41] That's just a picture that AI I think
[38:43] made it. But it's a beautiful I I like
[38:45] that draw. And then he says write write
[38:49] these things. write them because in the
[38:52] days of the voice of the seven angel
[38:55] when Shantel when Priscilla when Hana
[39:00] when Na when will be there these
[39:04] ministries are going to be revealed to
[39:06] them in that day you don't write them
[39:08] now just write those as symbols seal
[39:11] them you know John he was a precursor he
[39:15] was a sort of sort of you know when you
[39:18] say
[39:20] You know, they sent
[39:22] h they
[39:24] sent the two the 12 the 12 witnesses.
[39:28] They send them to the promised land for
[39:32] them to go and check the land and then
[39:34] they come back. Some came with the
[39:36] truth. Some came with not the truth.
[39:39] Some came with the evidence. I see the
[39:41] evidence. They came with the evidence.
[39:43] Hh. And then two only two of them when
[39:46] they came they had the evidence of that
[39:49] place. So John was on that day on the
[39:53] Lord's day he was taken he was in the
[39:56] spirit and he was taken on the Lord's
[39:58] day and then he was shown things that
[40:02] have passed things that are there and
[40:04] things that are to come right he was
[40:07] shown yesterday today and forever. He
[40:09] was shown there and John was like the
[40:12] bride you know everything that John
[40:14] because he was on the lost day there's
[40:16] no telephone or 5
[40:18] foot and in
[40:22] fact the lost day the lost day me and
[40:27] you are supposed to be on the in the
[40:30] Lord's day on a daily basis resting
[40:34] there right
[40:36] resting we we we
[40:39] a talk when the ministers teach teaches
[40:42] us and they say oh no peace in the
[40:44] middle of the storm you know they say in
[40:46] that middle of the storm where there's
[40:48] where where calmness is in the middle of
[40:50] the
[40:51] what John when he wrote that book
[40:53] brothers and sisters there was a big
[40:55] storm do you know that meant they boiled
[40:57] him in oil they boiled him in oil and he
[40:59] didn't die it was during the great time
[41:01] of persecutions of Christians during
[41:04] that time but the Bible says he was he
[41:06] was on the last He was in the spirit.
[41:10] They took him to an island called Patmos
[41:12] which was good for nothing. Snakes,
[41:15] rats, scorpions, everything because he
[41:18] couldn't die. They were frustrated. The
[41:19] enemy did not know what to do. So they
[41:21] took him there. But you see, can I tell
[41:26] you
[41:26] something? Everything that happens in
[41:28] your life is for the good.
[41:32] The Bible says, "All things work
[41:34] together for good for them that loves
[41:37] the Lord." So I I want to finish my
[41:39] sermon but I want you to understand that
[41:43] this rest that I'm talking about is not
[41:46] you don't have a choice. You have to be
[41:48] in the rest of the Lord and receive his
[41:51] rest.
[41:54] Let me show the young
[41:55] people. You see young people, those
[41:59] churches that the the the Lord was
[42:03] talking to John about and then he said
[42:05] to the church of Ephesus, to the church
[42:07] of Philadelphia, to those seven
[42:10] churches, right? As brother Brennham
[42:11] wrote these candlesticks and to show us
[42:14] now those churches, it was just like
[42:16] John was a symbol, an example for for
[42:19] the bride today. Those churches also in
[42:22] Asia, they were there. Those places are
[42:24] still there, some of them today. Ephesis
[42:26] is there. They're still there. But it
[42:28] was a an example that God was showing
[42:31] us. All the characteristics of those
[42:33] churches or those places was a
[42:36] reflection of each and every age from
[42:38] that time until today. Laudishia is
[42:41] today. Laudishia. But there was a city
[42:43] called Laudishia which had a personality
[42:46] or a characteristic of showing today.
[42:49] Just like John was an example of the
[42:52] bride and he had a preview that was also
[42:55] a preview. Those those literal church
[42:58] ages or places you can go today and go
[43:00] to a place called h there Philadelphia.
[43:03] They are there. Ephesus is there in
[43:06] Greece. Am I right? Is it in Greece?
[43:08] They are there because literally they
[43:10] were there. Some of those places have
[43:12] vanished now. But it their personality.
[43:15] Let's talk about the Ludicia. the Laia
[43:17] one of the it was a great city of
[43:19] civilized people of great medicine and
[43:20] everything but then it had it was too
[43:22] proud it was too much you know it
[43:25] thought they thought they were rich it
[43:27] was like today so that's why when I was
[43:30] young I never understood it was always
[43:32] confused me that how can you say we we
[43:35] are in Asia and I was asking and I never
[43:38] had the revelation I never understood so
[43:40] I want you young people to understand
[43:41] that is why I'm saying the parents we
[43:43] must encourage the young people to read
[43:45] the message to listen to the message to
[43:47] understand the fundamentals of the
[43:49] message not to be legalistic but to have
[43:52] the knowledge of the message to
[43:55] understand how can they believe if they
[43:58] don't read it
[44:00] but how can they read it if we don't
[44:02] read it you see so so that's my
[44:05] encouragement to say to you let's look
[44:08] at that last one the one can you see
[44:11] that dark area there and that light area
[44:14] why Why is it like that? I wish my girls
[44:17] were here, but it's only the boys today.
[44:19] So, why is it why why why do we have
[44:22] that part dark and just a little bit of
[44:25] of a light there?
[44:28] Why? Who can tell me? I wish my boys
[44:31] could tell me, but can help
[44:35] them? It is the darkest. You know,
[44:38] brother Brandham says h in one of the
[44:40] messages that actually when God showed
[44:42] him, it was actually almost dark. He
[44:45] just put a little light there because
[44:47] you are there. But it was actually
[44:49] completely a complete
[44:53] darkness. But you are there. You You are
[44:56] there. You are that light there. That's
[44:59] us there. That little light there. The
[45:01] rest of it, the world is right now,
[45:03] Brother Arman, the world is worse than
[45:04] when me and you were 157. is
[45:07] worse worse because he's getting to the
[45:11] end of the end
[45:13] now
[45:15] John Mo John he wrote that about us to
[45:20] know and then they were sealed in the
[45:21] book of revelation now they were
[45:23] revealed by Elijah whom we read now in
[45:26] the book of
[45:27] Malachi right who came in the body of
[45:30] William Brenham in the spirit of Elijah
[45:32] and then he revealed that's why he wrote
[45:34] the book of the seven seals that's why
[45:36] he thought the food, the message to to
[45:38] reveal the ministry, the the secrets of
[45:41] the Bible, God revealed them to you and
[45:43] to
[45:45] me. Are you Are we together, young
[45:47] people? And
[45:49] now, let's get to the rest. Let's get to
[45:52] the rest because I'm going everywhere.
[45:54] Let's get to the rest. God
[45:57] rested on the seventh
[46:00] day and we said, "God cannot get tired."
[46:03] So, what did God exactly do? I believe
[46:06] God was at a perfect fellowship with his
[46:09] creation. I believe it was the time when
[46:12] God was at a per because he did
[46:14] everything and then and then he formed
[46:17] and then he created the earth and
[46:19] everything everything was there. Then
[46:21] when you go to chapter three, if I'm not
[46:23] mistaken, he was he formed man. Man in
[46:25] the image now of not man the spirit, man
[46:28] the flesh. He formed him. But actually
[46:31] everything was already done. And then on
[46:33] the seventh day he rested. He was in his
[46:36] perfect fellowship with his
[46:39] creation. And he said, "Let us make
[46:41] man." Who? Who was talking to you?
[46:48] Now h I said here when you are in the
[46:53] rest of the
[46:54] Lord things starts to happen you know
[46:58] remember Abraham Abraham had some
[47:00] challenges he obeyed God he left but
[47:03] along the way he he he was looking for a
[47:05] city and then he left after leaving and
[47:07] then he at some point Abraham God said
[47:10] he's going to have but no Abraham no the
[47:12] child the child ah no no let me just
[47:15] let's take ha can you see that Abraham
[47:17] he believed God, but he had
[47:19] challenges. But when he believed God and
[47:22] God gave him the promise, even after the
[47:25] baby was born, Abraham was still
[47:27] prepared to take that child to go and
[47:28] crucify him because Abraham was now
[47:32] resting. Amen. He was resting. He was no
[47:36] more. He knew that the God who gave him
[47:38] the son, he can even bring him back
[47:41] instantly. That is why he was not
[47:43] hesitant.
[47:49] So as I said here, Abraham entered the
[47:52] rest of the Lord by believing
[47:55] fully in the word and it was imputed
[47:58] unto him righteousness. Let's quickly
[48:00] jump
[48:01] to here. What I I
[48:05] I hope I don't jump anything here, but I
[48:08] wanted you young people just to
[48:10] understand the story of this man called
[48:12] John because it talks about you and me
[48:16] and the revelation, the book of
[48:18] Revelation as it is, it is now as it was
[48:21] revealed and the prophet spoke so many
[48:23] messages talking about what was hidden
[48:25] up in there even the seven seals, the
[48:27] seven church ages. Go and read that
[48:30] book if you've got someone that you
[48:32] love. ah give it to him to read it. It's
[48:36] a powerful book. You can listen to the
[48:38] one that is written and you can even
[48:39] listen to the seven the actual preaching
[48:41] of the seven church ages. It's so
[48:44] enriching because it talks about where
[48:47] we come from and where we are going and
[48:50] afterwards you're going to find that ah
[48:51] you are different because you know more
[48:54] than what you knew than what you thought
[48:56] you knew and then you start to believe
[48:59] God differently. you start to act to
[49:02] leave those songs that we were singing
[49:04] to really surrender all your heart
[49:08] because now you see excuse me this is
[49:10] where I'm coming from excuse
[49:14] me brother the brother preached here and
[49:17] said the days of men are over the days
[49:20] of focusing on brother
[49:22] Paul and and and and sister so and so no
[49:26] those days are over the days of men of
[49:28] me thinking I'm one are over. There's no
[49:32] more days for men. These are the days
[49:35] for you and the Lord together to get to
[49:39] get to go in that little tent and go
[49:42] inside in that secret place with him
[49:45] individually. It's not a it's not a
[49:47] family
[49:49] matter. Okay? It's a family
[49:52] matter. What I mean
[49:54] is we don't go in groups in there. God
[49:59] is not going to say Joshua. All right,
[50:02] let me ask you again brother that why
[50:06] why didn't Joshua this this this. No,
[50:09] God is not going to do that. That is why
[50:11] I want you guys to take it for
[50:13] yourselves and appreciate for yourselves
[50:16] and know that you know that you
[50:19] know not think that you know not think
[50:22] that you believe not think that is
[50:24] revealed. Not think that you have him.
[50:28] to know that you have
[50:30] it. That is why he said man cannot live
[50:34] by bread alone. What he means that is
[50:37] that you can you you you live by the
[50:39] word of God. Your spiritual body grow by
[50:42] eating the word of God. That's what I'm
[50:44] trying to say. Young people, I really
[50:46] really have got a passion for the young
[50:48] people to understand this because I I
[50:52] never got it when I was young. I thought
[50:54] I had it. But you've got a chance, an
[50:57] opportunity to get it right. You started
[51:00] right and you can the devil along the
[51:03] way will not like you. He will not like
[51:05] you getting it right and he will fight
[51:07] that. You need to know
[51:10] that. Even you
[51:12] adults, middle-aged people, young
[51:15] people, young parents, young couple. He
[51:17] brings challenges for every. He brings
[51:19] challenges for the married, the
[51:21] unmarried, the newly married. But maybe
[51:24] during honeymoon stage is still still
[51:26] beautiful, you know. No, James, he's
[51:28] still the battles there ah they're good.
[51:32] They're bearable because it's still
[51:35] wonderful. But along the way he comes.
[51:38] So I'm warning you and telling you that
[51:41] he got a dashboard of everyone and he
[51:44] bring those things and he must find you
[51:47] being in the rest. Let's hear that rest.
[51:51] what what what what what the man of God
[51:53] says. Let's see what the Bible teaches
[51:56] us about the Sabbath
[51:59] rest because we saw him resting God and
[52:03] then we hear that there's a day of the
[52:04] Lord that is coming that is going to
[52:06] burn and then we also hear at the end
[52:08] that no um sorry in Malachi that the day
[52:11] is coming and we read in Genesis and we
[52:13] also read in the book of revelation when
[52:15] John was on the day. So let's hear that
[52:18] day. How is it applicable? How is it
[52:20] today? And how do I get into that
[52:25] rest? Let's see what the Bible teaches
[52:27] us about shalom rest. For he that is
[52:31] entered into his rest. This entering in
[52:34] is not only entering in by remaining but
[52:37] remaining in there the in the rest. It
[52:42] is an eternal rest of which the seventh
[52:45] day is but by the time. Can you see? So
[52:48] many many people including our lovely
[52:50] dear friends might be believing that the
[52:52] seventh day literal day. God told the
[52:55] children of Israel to observe the
[52:56] seventh day which was a Saturday if I'm
[52:59] not mistaken. Right? But that was only a
[53:02] shadow. It was only a negative. H it was
[53:05] only to show us the today we can't be
[53:08] observing the real Sabbath.
[53:11] is
[53:12] here. That's the real one that we
[53:14] observe to be in the Sabbath. The the
[53:17] rest of the Sabbath rest. We can't say
[53:20] Saturday. No. No. And then others are
[53:23] arguing. No, no, it's a Sunday. No. That
[53:25] was a shadow. It was for the children of
[53:28] Israel observing it. It was God. God. He
[53:32] He rested on the seventh day. So I I
[53:34] don't want to venture in that area yet
[53:36] because I don't want to say God to me it
[53:39] came about like you know the literal day
[53:42] and then also spiritually God rested
[53:45] when he finished but maybe that's a
[53:47] topic for some other time because with
[53:49] God even if you should say a day what is
[53:52] a
[53:53] day you know in God's books what is a
[53:56] day you read the Bible says no just to
[53:59] make it simple for you the Bible is
[54:01] Peter will say no because the day in the
[54:03] eyes of the Lord is like a thousand
[54:04] years. But you see, God is not time
[54:06] bound. Time is just but the tiny little
[54:08] thing and it shall be no more. So when
[54:11] you look at the day of the Lord, the
[54:13] seventh day, we're not looking at the
[54:15] literal 24 hours or a thousand years.
[54:18] God is not limited time bound by time
[54:22] and things like that. The real Sabbath
[54:24] rest is what we are going to read about
[54:26] here. Seven is completion.
[54:29] 8 is the first day again eternity. We're
[54:33] entering into eternity now. That is why
[54:36] Jesus Christ was raised. I mean that is
[54:38] why Jesus Christ here it says now oh
[54:41] what on the seventh on the seventh day
[54:44] the eighth day he was
[54:47] out. There was a reason why Jesus Christ
[54:50] rose on the day that he rose. Let's hear
[54:53] what brother Brennham says again. I'm
[54:55] only reading from this sermon.
[54:58] Jesus resurrection was in the first day
[55:00] of the
[55:01] week. You see after the seventh
[55:05] day because now that is eternity. Now it
[55:08] shows that he's no we are no more dying
[55:10] now. He's awake. He's eternally alive.
[55:14] Right? That's what it demonstrates
[55:16] there. That's we see why God could not
[55:18] give us any other certain day of the
[55:21] week as a Sabbath
[55:23] rest. we have entered into and do remain
[55:28] in our rest which Israel could not
[55:32] do. You see having only a shadow like I
[55:36] told you they only had a shadow. It was
[55:38] just a shadow reflecting your true
[55:40] Sabbath
[55:42] today. And then uh the third quotation I
[55:46] have for you. This will be the second
[55:48] last quotation if I'm not mistaken. Then
[55:50] we go home. I just wanted to emphasize
[55:53] about this today so that my
[55:57] students let you say brother Arman
[55:59] students he's a superintendent I'm just
[56:01] I'm just a teacher so that the students
[56:03] all Sunday school students including all
[56:06] adults if we could sit and have a lesson
[56:09] just to to unpack these things to take
[56:11] one one page at a time and do it and
[56:15] just
[56:18] understand with the knowledge of the
[56:20] Lord not our own understanding
[56:22] He says here, brother
[56:24] Brennham, and it came to pass about 700
[56:27] years later at Pentecost when they were
[56:29] filled with their Holy Spirit. Remember
[56:32] in the book of Joel, he said, "I will
[56:34] pour all all all my spirit upon all
[56:36] flesh." Young men will dream dreams.
[56:38] Remember that that chap Joel chapter 23,
[56:41] he said that. He was talking about the
[56:44] days the days of Pentecost when the
[56:46] spirit fell on the day of Pentecost
[56:49] until a songwriter made a song and says
[56:52] the wind is moving again just like the
[56:54] day of Pentecost the wind is moving
[56:57] again. You know the song I'll teach it
[56:59] one day to you. So we want to go back to
[57:02] the heart to the heart of our fathers
[57:07] back to Pentecost. But the Pentecost,
[57:10] that Pentecost you're talking about is
[57:12] going to be inside here.
[57:16] When we enter into the rest,
[57:20] nothing bothers you no more. You have
[57:23] arrived. Don't you want all these boys
[57:25] to arrive, all the girls, our girls to
[57:28] arrive and we arrive together with them.
[57:30] Have you ever sat down and imagine how
[57:32] millennium is going to be?
[57:35] Someone spoke about it and said Marion
[57:37] is going to hunt every day. or who was
[57:38] talking to me? Someone said, "Oh, but oh
[57:42] Mr. You said you said to me, she said, I
[57:45] think brother Brenam won't spend time at
[57:47] home. He'll just be up and
[57:49] about." Brothers and sisters, it's not a
[57:52] joke. It's not a recruitment. It's not
[57:54] something to bring you, to entice you.
[57:57] It's going to be a reality. It's going
[57:59] to be something you don't want to miss.
[58:00] And you want your children, your every
[58:03] even your enemy, you want them in. is so
[58:06] powerful because the history of the
[58:08] world as you know it it will be no more
[58:11] there shall be whatever you think you
[58:12] like and everything
[58:15] here sorry even the islands won't be
[58:19] there I don't know about New
[58:21] Zealand be no more islands be home you
[58:25] will imagine you having your own country
[58:28] you can create a country like Africa and
[58:31] this is yours say no no no this is this
[58:34] is the plot the plot for the islands.
[58:36] This one Africa imagine the whole of
[58:39] Africa and they say no no let's let's go
[58:41] let's go to our to our yard and then
[58:44] tomorrow brother today let's go maybe
[58:46] the whole of
[58:50] Europe I'm not I'm not trying to to make
[58:53] you otherwise this is the reality where
[58:56] we are going and we cannot afford our
[58:59] boys our girls our mothers fathers to
[59:03] miss
[59:05] Let me rather
[59:07] suffer for them to miss it. And I can
[59:11] only see it if I have the revelation and
[59:14] the rest we are talking about. I
[59:17] revealed that this message that John saw
[59:20] and he wrote revealing everything that
[59:23] from Genesis until today. That's what
[59:26] the message came to do. And we are so
[59:29] privileged in the language of the world.
[59:31] They say we are so
[59:34] lucky that this message came across us.
[59:37] We don't want to denominationalize the
[59:40] message. And brother Armand was warning
[59:43] us. No, let's not make it a creep. Let's
[59:46] not make it a denomination. Let's make
[59:47] it a life. Let's be proud and passionate
[59:50] about it without denominationalizing it.
[59:55] It doesn't become a life. Let it be a
[59:58] rest. Right. Let me read for you and
[1:00:00] then we go because we are going to pray
[1:00:02] now.
[1:00:05] Oops.
[1:00:07] Yeah. 700 years later, Pentecost
[1:00:12] happened. They were filled with the Holy
[1:00:16] Ghost exactly as it was said they would
[1:00:20] be. This is the true Sabbath that was
[1:00:24] promised. The There is your rest. They
[1:00:29] entered into the rest. There is your
[1:00:30] rest. That is your Sabbath. It is not a
[1:00:33] day, not a year, but the eternity of
[1:00:36] being filled and blessed in the Holy
[1:00:39] Spirit. Did you hear that? Can I read it
[1:00:43] again? It
[1:00:45] is H. Where was
[1:00:48] I? This is your rest. That is your
[1:00:51] Sabbath. It is not a day, not a year,
[1:00:54] but the eternity of being filled and
[1:00:57] blessed in this Holy Spirit. It is your
[1:01:00] ceasing. Seeing means to cease, to stop.
[1:01:03] It is your stop. You, me, we stop. It is
[1:01:06] our stopping. You do
[1:01:09] nothing. God doing. It is
[1:01:13] God in you willing and doing of his good
[1:01:19] pleasure because you are his queen. You
[1:01:22] know you are his queen. You know the way
[1:01:25] sorry James I always speak. You know the
[1:01:27] way James love Tiana is is is his queen.
[1:01:30] So in other words heaven and earth shall
[1:01:32] pass. No but not
[1:01:34] tal. You see that's how the Lord talks
[1:01:37] about
[1:01:38] us. I'm trying to demonstrate a point my
[1:01:41] my son. story but I'm trying to show
[1:01:44] you the love that I love my wife my
[1:01:48] queen when I think of sep everything
[1:01:53] stop huh everything until even a king in
[1:01:58] the old testament said Esther my queen
[1:02:00] even half of my kingdom
[1:02:04] now how much about god I'm trying to
[1:02:07] give you the physical example for you to
[1:02:09] think
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:13] God love you very much. That's why he
[1:02:16] did what he did. That's why everything
[1:02:19] that happens is for your
[1:02:21] good.
[1:02:25] Everything. Let's finish
[1:02:28] off this one. I'm going to show you
[1:02:32] something. I was here.
[1:02:44] Jesus will give you
[1:02:46] rest. I I just wish I could just share
[1:02:49] this slide on the brothers and sisters
[1:02:51] because tonight I really wanted to
[1:02:53] finish at half past 8 and it is half
[1:02:55] past 8 now. But uh you see me as a human
[1:02:58] being I can't tell you better. I can't
[1:03:02] explain to you better. His spirit can I
[1:03:06] wish and I pray that his spirit can just
[1:03:09] you know just overemphasize this in your
[1:03:11] lives for you to know that you have
[1:03:14] entered in his rest. If you have not
[1:03:17] that you want to enter in that rest and
[1:03:20] go and pray a fervent prayer availth
[1:03:23] much. The Bible says a fervent prayer
[1:03:26] availth much. You see the reason we
[1:03:29] don't receive is because we don't ask.
[1:03:32] Maybe when we ask we ask a
[1:03:35] miss. We must ask to say Lord your will
[1:03:39] be done in my life. Because brothers and
[1:03:43] sisters make no mistake mama mas mothers
[1:03:46] you want wonderful things to happen to
[1:03:48] your children don't you want good things
[1:03:51] to happen to your loved ones. All of us
[1:03:56] parents we do because our parents when
[1:03:59] me when I left and I came to New Zealand
[1:04:01] my dad encouraged us something contrary
[1:04:04] to what many people believe because he
[1:04:07] wanted the best for us. Amen.
[1:04:10] That man suffered for me 100 rand every
[1:04:14] month giving me waking up 4:00 every day
[1:04:18] and I hear the dog bang boom winter and
[1:04:20] summer in to get a bus to go 72
[1:04:24] kilometers from home to work to work for
[1:04:26] who because he wanted the best for me.
[1:04:29] So you want the best for your
[1:04:32] children don't you? You want your
[1:04:35] children, you know, you know, to to to
[1:04:37] to to graduate, to achieve, to
[1:04:41] accomplish. You want them to be
[1:04:42] successful, to be able to be better than
[1:04:44] you,
[1:04:47] don't you? You You want, you know, you
[1:04:49] want Halia to be to decorate better than
[1:04:52] you, sister President? Isn't
[1:04:55] it? I'm sorry. I like giving examples.
[1:04:58] Forgive me.
[1:05:00] you you want them to achieve you know
[1:05:02] and they say this is corporal Joshua not
[1:05:08] you know with that mental you know it's
[1:05:10] not it's not a joke it is highly
[1:05:12] respected you want them to achieve a
[1:05:14] sense of
[1:05:16] achievement a sense of saying you know
[1:05:18] when the days our kids are adopted when
[1:05:22] you sit down brother Ed and they explain
[1:05:24] to you he said yeah even you in your
[1:05:27] heart you hear he said this boy now he's
[1:05:30] got wisdom. He has arrived.
[1:05:33] He has arrived. And then you see his
[1:05:36] children. You see they serve the Lord.
[1:05:37] His wife loves him, respects him. They
[1:05:39] serve the Lord. They have entered into
[1:05:41] the rest. That's what you want for your
[1:05:44] children. Am I right or wrong?
[1:05:47] Should I say, am I right or am I right?
[1:05:52] That's what you want. But to be honest
[1:05:54] with you, brothers and sisters, yes,
[1:05:56] it's true. We want those things. But to
[1:05:58] be honest, we actually want them to
[1:06:00] arrive into the rest of fellowship with
[1:06:04] Christ of brothers and sisters to be in
[1:06:07] the spirit all the time. Yes, all those
[1:06:10] things are important. I'm not disputing
[1:06:12] that. Yes, graduation, worldly
[1:06:15] achievements, money, everything. Nice
[1:06:19] husband, nice wives, those things are
[1:06:21] important. But to be honest, we actually
[1:06:25] want them to arrive in the rest of the
[1:06:28] Lord, to have a baptism of the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit, to arrive in the Lord. Are they
[1:06:33] not lovely? And those those guys, aren't
[1:06:36] they lovely?
[1:06:38] You you want the harmony. The Bible says
[1:06:40] in the book of Psalms, behold, how
[1:06:43] wonderful and beautiful it is when
[1:06:45] brothers get together. The fellowship is
[1:06:48] like when oil is poured on the beards of
[1:06:50] aron melting down to the you know that's
[1:06:52] how fellowship
[1:06:54] is. Imagine the fellowship with the
[1:06:56] Lord. This is just the beginning of the
[1:06:59] real
[1:07:02] fellowship. Just look at those
[1:07:06] guys. You can even put them on your
[1:07:10] status. Can the musicians please come? I
[1:07:14] I I probably did not say everything that
[1:07:16] I wanted to say, but it's about the
[1:07:20] rest. Resting in him, because God rested
[1:07:23] and had perfect fellowship. It's about
[1:07:25] us resting in him. That eternal rest is
[1:07:31] what me and you should enter
[1:07:35] in. You want me to teach you that
[1:07:39] song? Maybe some other time. Do you
[1:07:42] think I can teach them, Joy? I can teach
[1:07:44] you guys. All right, let's let's let's
[1:07:47] let's clap hands for
[1:07:51] Jesus because we love him and we
[1:07:54] appreciate him. And sometimes I feel
[1:07:57] unworthy. Sometimes I feel
[1:08:00] unqualified. But he has made you and us
[1:08:03] and me qualified. Not in our merit, in
[1:08:06] his merit. The Bible says all things
[1:08:09] will be over soon. And we can see
[1:08:11] they're getting there. So this is just
[1:08:14] the last last last minutes. The last few
[1:08:18] minutes we want to make it. Don't let
[1:08:22] anything disturb you young people. Um
[1:08:26] we'll
[1:08:27] sing I can I can what is the word do? I
[1:08:30] can wake it to wake it the song without
[1:08:33] without and teach it to you. Then what
[1:08:37] what was the song again?
[1:08:40] Just like the day of the
[1:08:42] Pentecost, the wind is blow. Let's stand
[1:08:44] on our feet. I'll teach it to you
[1:08:46] because just for two minutes, then then
[1:08:48] we can go home
[1:08:50] early. It says the wind is blowing
[1:08:54] today. Oh, the wind is blowing
[1:08:58] today. Oh, just like the day of the
[1:09:02] Pentacles. The wind is blowing again. I
[1:09:06] forgot. Oh, the wind is blowing
[1:09:10] again. Oh, the wind is blowing
[1:09:15] again. Just like the day of the
[1:09:19] pent. The wind is blow. The wind is
[1:09:24] blowing. The wind is blowing
[1:09:27] again. Oh, the wind is blowing again.
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:34] as like the day of the
[1:09:37] pentacles. The wind is blow. Oh, the
[1:09:40] wind is blowing. The wind is blowing
[1:09:45] again. The wind is blowing
[1:09:49] again. Oh, just like the day of
[1:09:54] the wind is blowing
[1:09:59] again. We give this one to brother
[1:10:01] Isaac.
[1:10:03] He will spice it up for us and he will
[1:10:08] add more ways. We we we are blessed. He
[1:10:11] we've got gifts that we must just open
[1:10:13] the drawer and use. We've got those kind
[1:10:15] of gifts. So he will give it to him and
[1:10:18] I can hear the band got the the beat for
[1:10:21] it already. Then we'll give it to Isaac
[1:10:23] and then he can spice it better and
[1:10:26] bring it to the right king.
[1:10:29] We've got prayer
[1:10:30] requests and then we are going to pray
[1:10:33] and then we can go in
[1:10:36] peace to go and be in the
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:10:42] rest. No matter what I
[1:10:46] say, no matter what I
[1:10:50] feel, no matter what I
[1:10:54] hear, I
[1:10:57] believe. No matter what I'm
[1:11:01] told, no matter how it
[1:11:04] seems, no matter what it
[1:11:09] cost, I
[1:11:13] believe. And if I look and it seems like
[1:11:17] it's
[1:11:20] broken, I'll lay a
[1:11:23] hallelu on the altar.
[1:11:29] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:11:35] over, I'll lay a
[1:11:38] hallelujah on the
[1:11:42] altar because he's a miracle. He's a
[1:11:47] miracle. He's a miracle working God.
[1:11:51] He's a miracle. He's a miracle. He's a
[1:11:56] miracle working God. He's a miracle.
[1:12:00] He's a miracle. He's a miracle working
[1:12:05] God. He's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[1:12:09] He's a miracle working God. A miracle
[1:12:13] working. No matter what I
[1:12:17] see, no matter what I
[1:12:20] feel, no matter what I
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] hear, I
[1:12:27] believe, no matter what I'm
[1:12:31] told, no matter how it
[1:12:34] seems, no matter what it
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:38] costs, I believe.
[1:12:43] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:12:49] broken, I'll lay a
[1:12:52] hallelujah on the altar.
[1:12:57] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:13:03] over, I'll lay a
[1:13:06] hallelujah on the
[1:13:09] altar because he's a miracle. He's a
[1:13:14] miracle. He's a miracle working God.
[1:13:18] He's a miracle. He's a miracle. He's a
[1:13:22] miracle working God. He's a miracle.
[1:13:27] He's a miracle. He's a miracle working
[1:13:31] God. He's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[1:13:36] He's a miracle working God. A miracle
[1:13:40] working, death defeating,
[1:13:43] promisekeeping
[1:13:44] God. A miracle working, death defeating,
[1:13:50] promisekeeping God.
[1:13:52] A miracle working, death defeating,
[1:13:56] promiseke keeping
[1:13:58] God. A miracle working, death defeating,
[1:14:03] promisekeeping
