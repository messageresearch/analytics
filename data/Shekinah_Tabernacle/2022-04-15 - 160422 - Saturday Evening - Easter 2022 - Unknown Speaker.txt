night uh it's like a kind of a bit difficult as well to put in the preachers would preach and would be doing what so it was kind of very difficult for me i only told him yesterday uh uh i think it was a after supper or before supply sometime around that time amen so for a preacher it's very difficult to sort of like get something prepared during that time so he said i'll come back to you and then uh he went and then uh we we left here we're doing some duties just our cleaning and then i said to brother alpha why don't we go inside we we pray and we came and i was right there i was praying and my phone rang and i could not take my my phone because i was talking to the king and they they hung up and they sent me a message so when i went out there the message was it was brother queben he was phoning me and you are saying it's all right i'll take the service amen so to me that's a confirmation i was right on the altar right in front here praying and the preacher says the phone rings and he says we'll take the service so we are also expecting the lord to speak to us it was very beautiful in the morning oh my oh my oh who is the world the lord is his different way of using people very different way that i appreciate at times it's when the preacher is maybe thinks he's picking his books and is about to go away and he starts talking something and he just goes right into your problem and he just gives you a solution to your problem that has happened to me he was just speaking probably it's just speaking casual and just god just answers it just does it amen praise our lord we shall be saying seek him boy hallelujah praise our lord god bless you brother queben uh i'm not much of a singer let's see i i spoil the whole thing i'll ask your brother can you lead us in a song and as
