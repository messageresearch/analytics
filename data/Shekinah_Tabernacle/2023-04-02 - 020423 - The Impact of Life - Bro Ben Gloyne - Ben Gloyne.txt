Lord with everyone watching as well this morning in Jesus Christ's name we lord we're commit ourselves into your hands for your glory amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning I'd like to if I could take a subject I'd like to talk about the impact of life now I'm not talking about the impact of natural life and the cares of this world I'm not talking about that kind of impact I'm talking about the impact of Supernatural life you know the life of God when it impacts us amen because nothing can remain the same after it's come into its presence nothing can be nothing can stay the same amen I'm not just talking about people I'm talking about death will get there as well talk about Satan everything nothing can stay the same once it's been impacted by eternal life amen is the as as John would say in first John this is that which we have from the beginning which we have heard which you have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and be a witness and shown to you that eternal life which was with the father was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that we also that ye Also may have Fellowship without and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things we write unto you that your joy may be full amen says not that your sorrow would be magnifiers that your joy would be full amen so life always conquers death yes sir many times we think death conquers life because you know sadly his time with Terry you know we'll bury our loved ones and our parents and different ones and you know but and we think so death is one but death does not win I mean but life conquers death always light conquers Darkness always amen that's the reason why amen the darkness has to fleece because light shines I mean the only reason that we have night is because there's the absence of the Sun and it's on the other side of the Earth but when the when the when the earth orbits around the Sun amen we come into you know face to face with the sunshine amen Darkness has to flee and because darkness is the absence of light amen but it's the light that pushes the darkness I mean it's not the darkness that pushes the light and it's the same thing in this day in the spiritual it's not the darkness I mean it pushes the light amen pushes the word of God to a side no it's actually the light pushes the darkness together amen it brings a friendship between those who normally wouldn't be friends I mean like Herod and pilate became friends because they crucified the Lord Jesus people would never have nothing to do with each other they they become they have Fellowship because why the light was pushing the darkness together but I'm so thankful that we are not the darkness we are the light today I mean where God is pushing us to himself amen drawing amen where where the cherubims amen after Adam and Eve foul actually drove the you know kept the way of the Tree of Life to keep people away from the Tree of Life now those anointings that come upon on the earth to drive us into the tree of life I mean that we could be partakers of Life Hallelujah I'm so thankful that life has an impact Amen in the greater the force the greater the impact amen I say we've all been impacted by eternal life today I trust you can look back in your life and say once upon a time you weren't impacted by eternal life but eternal life was looking for you amen and he found you and changed your life Hallelujah and I trust even in this service this morning amen life will impact us will impact me amen you know I was thinking about the um you know the convention we're going to in Auckland yes you know it's the first convention that Brother Andy and and Brian myself were in Hallelujah and it was a Monumental occasion in my Christian walk and maybe I'm just a bit nostalgic Lord I want to have that same kind of experience again Lord it was in 2009 but you're the same God in 2023. Hallelujah I remember remember going to those services and I turned up late the deacons put me at the front of it this is me for the rest of the camp I didn't care about who was behind me Hallelujah God was in front of me and I was focused on them and we had such a jubilee time zone I pray we'll have that experience even here amen next Sunday you'll have such a resurrection moment amen because God has got everywhere God's children gather amen it's not about the specialness of the speaker or the size of the crowd it's the size of our God that comes down amen touches us personally Hallelujah so I mean I'm looking for a grand time but I but I'm looking for a grand time this morning I mean I'm so thankful we can say life has impacted us amen God has come in contact with us amen and we've never been the same Amen brother bam says from that time he says and there is a place where a man can come to a time that will change him forever for Eternal he will he that will come to me I'll no wise cast out said Jesus amen man can come to God in his whole Eternal destination has changed and a man can meet God he could never be the same anymore you can't make God never remain the same person you was if you turn away from him you'll be a worse person than you was but if you receive him you've got eternal life and he'll raise you up for the last day by his promise amen so I'm so thankful even if we may have turned him down in the past we can come back to him I mean he can restore all the years the enemy has taken from us he says I'll restore all the years the Palm worm Cancun locus of caterpillar to you know have eaten you know I'm so so I'm so thankful amen that we can come back to him amen and we can be impacted by eternal life in the right way amen like the two thieves on the cross you know they were impacted the wrong way actually God manifested in front of them actually drove them away from him because they were caught in the anointing of the scribes and Pharisees making fun of the Lord amen but one had another look amen he said father he said Lord remember me when you come into my kingdom when you come into your kingdom amen he says today you'll be with me in Paradise so because remember both thieves were making fun of the Lord like all the rest but one had another look amen so so initially amen life was impacting them actually drive their attitude towards life was driving them away from God but then he looked again his attitude changed and brought him into Paradise Hallelujah so I'm so thankful God's merciful amen there's life in the body There's Hope Hallelujah so we're not hopeless or helpless Mo but God is here amen praise God Hallelujah amen because remember we all walked one time according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in this in the children of Disobedience we all had our conversation our manner of life that way doesn't matter if we're raised in church or came out of the world we all walked according to the anointing anointing of the enemy amen and we and we fulfill the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our fleshion of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others this is from Ephesians 2. amen but then one day life came amen but God Richard Mercy amen for his great love when he loved us even when we were dead and sins has quickened us together with Christ by Grace we are saved amen has raised us up together made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that's why I say no one can be the same once they've been in the presence of God Amen no one can walk away the same as an impact amen there's a force of life and which impacts us because once we were dead we may have had natural life in our bodies I'm not talking about that kind of life being impacted by that life I'm talking about eternal life I mean being impacted by his life amen where one time we were dead friends I trust this place this blesses me Hallelujah we can Rejoice you know we we have the greatest thing to celebrate we have life to celebrate eternal life amen and we didn't earn it we didn't we didn't work it out it found us we weren't looking for life life was finding us amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so let's look at a few people that have been impacted by life Hallelujah let's take a journey through the scripture amen Enoch if he could stand here and say you know I was 65 years old sure I was from a good lineage and I could talk to Adam and Eve and I you know all the testimonies for the Believers down through amen but I just had mortal life but when I was 65 years old I Heard a Voice and that voice said will you walk with me and then I decide I'm going to walk with that voice I mean that was the voice of God I mean the ones that you know I heard testimonies of of the great Creator God who made all things but then I heard the voice that spoke let there be sun moon and stars and that voice said come and walk with me amen so so I begin to walk with God and then when I came into trials they said walk with me through the trail Once you walk with me because it's an invitation every day will he walk with him amen so Enoch was invited every day the Lord would say come walk with me today he said I love to walk with you Lord amen so so he got into trials but he walked with God Amen through temptation God walked them through the Temptation amen through hardship amen he walked with God I mean like brother bam says that there's trouble comes up in church walk with God Amen if sickness strikes you walk with God Amen of this financial difficulty walk with God trouble at home walk with God Amen to every time those things would strike Enoch God would say walk with me through the trouble I mean don't stay in the trouble walk with me through the trouble because I want to show myself in this trouble amen there's a reason why all things come upon us is that God wants to show life Hallelujah he wants to show his life eternal life I mean not fighting and fussing and stewing and trouble that's just natural life but eternal life will turn the other cheek eternal life or love the unlovable eternal life will want the best for one another amen eternal life is not selfish Hallelujah amen so you know yeah you know Enoch would come through rejection God says walk with me through the rejection amen through sickness through trouble and then one day I walked all the way there I walked all the way home with that Voice Hallelujah I walked with him and he took me home into Glory why because life impacted Enoch that same life has impacted you and I friends it's more than a story amen he's alive this morning Hallelujah why because Enoch was impacted by life and he is so impacted by life it changed his whole Eternal destination it wasn't just a Sunday morning or a Wednesday or even reading the Bible from time to time and impacted his whole life that he walked with that voice her loots are so amazing God came down in the garden after the fall amen and they ran from that voice but something and he knocks it I want to walk with that voice I learned the same thing with you and I friends I trusted something in you I want to walk with the voice of God I don't just want to talk to him I want him to talk to me I want him to have Fellowship in my sufferings and my pain and my hardship and my trouble amen that I'm not alone we're not alone this morning friends amen we're not alone Hallelujah let's just let's just knock one thing to one side people say I'm not worthy for God to walk with me get that idea out of your head amen God makes us worthy amen he became the lowest of the low I mean to lift up the lowest and to the highest place I mean even he went to the lowest city in the world Jericho I mean and the shortest man in that shortest in that last city had to climb a tree to look down on the Lord to see him for who he was That's How Low our lord Jesus became amen so how God Amen don't worry about your worthiness it's his worthiness I mean it's what he has done that's what that's all that matters it's not what you think about yourself it's what his word says about you amen and this word does not say that we're lost and wretched and miserable naked blind amen full of sin that's not what this word says about me or you this word says you're worthy this word says you're being washed in the blood this word says he's made a way for you this word says your righteousness he is righteous it means we're going to take him at his word say yea Lord I believe what you've said about me I believe your testimony God about me well that's how we should be this morning amen don't don't listen to your own testimony take God's testimony about you but don't you know my failures and false god knows them more than you know about them and God doesn't hold them against you Hallelujah so why should we hold those against ourselves I mean let's take another one let's take job job working up against standing and say you know I was I was a wise man God give me great wisdom God blessed me with cattle and land and family and all these things and I had everything and yet you know and and and I heard about this great God that that that required a lamb sacrifice so I so so I'd sacrifice a lamb I even sacrificed it for my children and you know pre-adventure they had sinned or done anything wrong and you know but then one day one day I came into a great trial of my life where I lost everything in a day I lost my children I lost my life you know I lost my sheep and my cattle and everything I lost it all amen but there was something in me because of the Lamb Hallelujah now that sacrifice what it was pointing to came and talked to me and I was impacted by eternal life where once I was just wondering where where do we go when we die what happens you know I see the resurrection in nature I see everything around you know trees come back life comes back but where does man go we put man in the grave where does he go but then life came and impacted my eternal life came on the scene Hallelujah and then because of that I can stand and say no I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though my skin worms destroy destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll see God why could he say that because he was impacted by life amen eternal life came his way amen here since Sarah he was a sincere believer brother Ram said the reason he is a perfect man is because he trusted in the blood of the Lamb that's what made him perfect friends and that's the same thing with you and I it's not our ability it's not how smart we are how righteous we think we are it's our are we fully trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ amen because remember and and I'll get it get to it to the end of the service but you know the Christian Walkers based on rest the Christian Life is rest it's not struggling fussing and trouble it's rest Amen to but but you can only rest if you're fully trusting for the blood for everything Hallelujah you can't you know because what happens is we get to a stage where we get to worry about now you know subconsciously we think it's our works and the blood will Merit anything from God but no it's the blood alone Hallelujah praise the Lord amen and in job because he was impacted by life he says but I know the way but he knows the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold Hallelujah I mean he is impacted by life amen and then when he is impacted by life that life said God told him now you go pray for your friends now you go off of forgiveness you you you be the priest for them when they've been telling a lie about what life really is the impact of Life saying your secret Synod job you've done all this wrong he had to go pray for his friends and then God turned his captivity but why could he do that because he's impacted by life I mean he wasn't impacted by arguments or religion or or misunderstandings he was impacted by eternal life that's why he could forgive his friends for lying to him about who God was because remember they were preaching to job this is why this has happened and this is why this and now we're using all religious arguments they were preaching a false gospel to him and then God came on the scene said what they're saying is lying this is what the truth is but because but you've got to pray for them because my wrath is turned against them but because he was impacted by eternal life he could now how about you and I friends can we if we've been impacted not just impressed impacted I mean Something's Happened there's been a life-changing moment one day we're going this way now we're going that way with god what happened there was an impact amen a force greater than death a force greater than our pride a force greater than our Humanity impacted us and now we're walking with the Lord Hallelujah I trust that's happened to you yeah I'm just giving you your testimony back to you this morning because we've got to realize the victory remember Calvary was a victory the resurrection was a victory and now we are the beneficiaries of that Victory Amen in 2023. Hallelujah we can walk in Victory now because of what he has done for us that's all that matters Hallelujah amen we're closer to God he's closer than your next breath amen Hallelujah amen If Abraham could stand here and say amen he was like any other ordinary Man actually him and his family his forebeest came out of the Tower of Babel they were Idol worshipers they were he was just like any other man but one day God called him by the way I'm saying there was nothing special about Abraham but God called him that's what makes the difference and same thing with you and I there's nothing special about you and I but God called us that's what made the difference in our lives what happened is so one day he thought this is where I'm from this is my family this is where I should be I'm from the ear of the chaldees this is who I am he was only impacted by natural life with that thinking right but then God came down and called him say get from at this land I'll take you to another land what happened eternal life impacted him and then we he began to walk with God and then he began to look for that City whose Builder and maker is God he walked upon the very land where that city is going to come down he was so sure it was there somewhere why because he was impacted by eternal life hallelujah amen he met the king of that City okay excuse me amen he met the king of that City he was so impacted by eternal life Hallelujah that he looked for that City I'm trust you've been impacted that same way I'm just a pilgrim and a stranger what's going on in the world it's going to chew itself up Let it chew we've we've got another calling we've got a high and holy calling this hour we're not here to be caught up in what's going on in the world it'll do what it'll do it'll fulfill what it's meant to fulfill amen but let's fulfill the word that's allotted us I mean to be a living witness in this end time that people would see actually we have something different and it's not because we're putting put on suits and ties and carry a Bible no but there's a writ there's life because why we get impacted by life that that life will impact others through us Hallelujah amen amen if Moses could stand here he'd say I knew the promise I knew I was going to be the deliverer my mother would whisper it into my into my ears when I was young you're going to be a deliverer God answered our prayers give the testimony when he was born God kept you safe in the Nile God brought you here into Pharaoh's household not that you'd become fair but you'd deliver our people because you are the answer to prophecy that's why you're being raised up as a deliverer just like we are actually an answer to prophecy this morning amen God prophesied of a bride and here we are the answer that prophecy I think it's got to be a fulfillment amen but then he said you know I I was just impacted by reasoning and learning though I knew the quotes I knew the scriptures I knew all those things I knew my position in it but you know I was just impacted by natural life and I tried to do it in my own strength but then I just killed one Egyptian and ran for my life but then when I was 80 years old eternal life impacted me I was I was just raising my father-in-law's sheep I thought this is all it was for me this is this is all life was I mean but then eternal life came down in the form of a burning bush and impacted me in such a way and I learned more about God in those five minutes than I did the 80 years of my entire life those I don't know what my mother taught me was true though all those things were true but I needed the one who gave the prophecy to come live in me and fulfill the prophecy amens the same thing with you and I friends there's many promises in the scripture but we need him the quickener of the word I mean they're coming quicker in our lives and bring it to past hey Mr this is then I was impacted by eternal life now I was no longer my own I was a prisoner to love divine and I went down into Egypt amen you know many times we think of it's just death coming to Egypt no it was actually Life coming in but a pharaoh would have just received that life Hallelujah they would have been a Powerhouse a greater Powerhouse than they were but God raised him up to show his mighty hand but it was life to the Israelites amen I'm so thankful in this Exodus it's life to you and I it's not death praise God it's life to whosoever will amen and then he was so impacted that he that he followed the Lord now let's just come to Elijah I'm just jumping through a few here Hallelujah I'm just I'm just jumping through a few here Elijah Elijah would say I was just a farmer I was just a man of the Wilderness but that I was impacted by life I just wanna I'm just going to repeat this through the scripture going on a journey because I trust it means something to you amen so Elijah was impacted by life amen he fed me when there was a drought amen he gave me victory in the face of Baal and all of his prophets amen he and and and I'm so thankful that he didn't answer my prayers when I was under the juniper tree aren't you glad that he doesn't answer all your prayers Abraham no I mean I mean Elijah prayed with all of his heart Lord take my life I'm just like my fathers he had no idea there was a chariot right he had to take one day I mean he was praying a country to the will of God for his life and God didn't answer that prayer aren't you glad sometimes we get so torn up and stressed we're praying and God I'm useless God I can't maybe it's just me God yeah I you know I can't overcome I'm never gonna and he doesn't listen to that because because Elijah says I'm just like my father's he wasn't just like his fathers he heard the voice of God Amen he followed God he's you know when the altar was there the sacrifice was there was covered in water I'm out come he says Lord I've done all this according to your word what if his fathers followed the word none of them followed the word they were following Baal and all the stuff but see he wasn't like his fathers and he wasn't built like his fathers because he was unique in his generation because he had to go on a Rapture so he wasn't like his fathers but he says Lord I'm just like everyone else no no we're not God's made us different you and your Humanity may feel the same but we're not all the same amen God's ordained a different path for you and I if we go by the way of the Grave or the dead in Christ arise first you win if you go you know if you're alive your body's changed you win so either way we win Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and I was so impacted by his voice that when I got down to the end of my road he sent down a flaming Chariot to take me home while he was impacted by eternal life Hallelujah now we know we know life and death can't dwell together amen well I'll come to that later actually amen let's bring King David here amen David could say you know I was a young man and then I came into contact with life life impacted me amen when I came before the prophet Samuel Vindicated Prophet for his age amen and he anointed me amen and he said the spirit of God was with me from that day on I was impacted by that anointing amen just like the bride of Christ is impacted by the anointing of the word in this day Hallelujah he says now as a Shepherd before that but then the Lord became my shepherd say we were impacted by life it leads us it doesn't just throw us off into a corner but no his life leads us his presence goes before us amen he surrounds us he's within us amen he says I was I was a Shepherd but then the Lord became my shepherd amen he became more than life to me amen sure I played the heart before that but it was different when I play after he after I was impacted by eternal life because he came down to enjoy the song Hallelujah you may not be able to sing like nothing but you just sing from your heart one time and God will come and enjoy that song Hallelujah I mean it was my joy he was my peace I went through great struggles in the wilderness in great trouble and I was on the run and so much distressed but he was I was so impacted by him he said I was going to stand on the throne one day and I knew that that promise was true because I was so impacted by that anointing earlier I went through great trouble and great hardship Hallelujah but he became my peace and my joy and my strength amen as long as I stayed close to him I won every battle amen why because life remember death could not stand in the presence of life amen remember that lion and that bear represented death just a natural death but life conquered that death amen Goliath represented death but life conquered death hallelujah amen life cut death head off and carries it as a trophy Hallelujah so as long as I stay close to him I won every battle because he was my shepherd and a true Shepherd will defend his Sheep amen they won't let any War for devil nothing coming amen so a true Shepherd fights amen for us amen but when I did stray he came after me because it's not just see see it's not just when we're on the path that we appreciate life that's impacted us when we stray off the path remember all sheep they've gone astray there's always moments that oh walk where we wander off and do things we shouldn't wander off into amen but our Shepherd leaves the 99 and he goes after the one amen he says I did stray but he came after me he didn't leave me in that backslidden state when I took Bathsheba and killed Uriah and covered up all the sin no God doesn't leave us in those things if we've been impacted by life remember he saves us to keep us amen so he doesn't let us wander off too far he wants to bring us back on the track way because he is our Shepherd aren't you glad we have a Shepherd this morning amen if we get cold and lukewarm and formal and distant detached God doesn't leave us in that state he comes after us amen that's why David could say surely goodness and mercy shall follow me over days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever he knew that from experience because when it says goodness and mercy shall follow me that follow means actually to pursue after it means to hunt down so it's not just it's not just following from a distance following from behind and you're up there and it's back here no God God's mercy and his goodness that follows us actually pursues us and actually overtakes us and apprehends us and brings us home aren't you glad that we can be impacted by life like that hallelujah what a victory we have friends what a victory is one you and I amen when in our natural selves there's not there's nothing in this person that actually hungers after God it's a supernatural longing that God puts in US amen it's not us that decides you're going to be a Christian one day it's God it's God put something and you say my child I need your attention I want you to be impacted by my life not in a negative way but in a positive way Hallelujah Hallelujah when I went off the path is goodness and mercy Hunted Me Down and then I could say Lord Blood Out hide hide thy face from my sins Lord blot out all my iniquities created me a clean out our Lord and your right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me because there's something when you get impacted by eternal life you never want to leave that place you never want to leave that presence you just want to be there forever if you can just live the rest of your days exactly in that moment you'd be the happiest person in all the world but I'm so thankful that that presence isn't contained to a building or a moment in a car or a moment at a house wherever he found you but his presence goes with you even into the trials of life even to the cares of life God's in there amen God doesn't just give make us overcome us when there's no trouble no he wants to show you you can be the busiest person with the biggest family but yet you can be Victorious and walk in peace Hallelujah I'm so glad for that aren't you friends Hallelujah amen but then one day my shepherd came to me the one last time he says I'm going to lead you David and then David asked them where are we going Lord are we going to go to gilgal we're going to go to Ramos Gilead and we're going to go to some place and Israel says no I'm going to take you to eternal that's where life leads us Hallelujah because it's not just a Shepherd a natural life it's that moment it's that moment when our last breath leaves our body or when these when these bodies are changed that's the moment that counts remember we're living for that moment aren't we we're like you know like brother Bosworth you know he was dying brother Brown went in to see him he says when was the best moment of your life brother bosworthy says right now because in a few moments the one I've Loved let's go to walk through that door and take me home I trust you feel that way this morning I feel that way I'm looking for that moment that's what we live for the one who died for us the one who cared for us through life when we couldn't we when we couldn't meet it when we couldn't come to ends meet we had no food God provided I mean we're in trouble and hardship God provided it can seem such a natural thing but it's God's unseen hand guiding people to look after you Hallelujah when you wanted to throw it all away life is impacted you in such a way says you can't throw me away because I won't throw you away Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah say he was led to Eternal pastures green why because he's impacted by life Hallelujah Hallelujah now we look at we look at ones like the woman at the well I'm so glad life interrupts Natural Life I'm so glad we can you know sometimes we think this is just me for the rest of my life and I've been going through the motions day after day week after week you know like Hershey you know she had five husbands she's living with another man all this trouble but then life had to impact her because life said I have I need to go by the way of Samaria and if he really explained it to his disciples he said I have a gene seed I have an attribute and Samaria I'm in the outside may look all mad up but down on the soul is part of me I must go by part of me amen so he goes by the well he begins to reveal himself what was happening life was impacting I mean at first they had a religious conversation because she wasn't quite getting it yet I mean yes our fathers worshiped here and did this and this is what churches like and blah blah blah blah blah but God wants to go beyond that and then he wants to reveal himself saying that's why he reveals the secrets of our hearts he speaks to our hearts what he's trying to get us to see it's Messiah speaking amen it is life impacting you and I Hallelujah I'm so glad I'm so glad even if our eyes get callous God makes them soft again that's what I've been I've been praying this week soften my heart with oil Lord maima I think it's like Keith Green said Lord May the skin of my heart be like a baby skin soft and pliable that even the smallest touch can touch me impact me so greatly I mean this world has become callous but we don't have to become calloused and the reason the world becomes callous is they don't know the answer out I mean that's why we get frustrated and we get hardened because we don't see the way out but he's our way out Hallelujah so may we never become hardened Hallelujah amen there she was I mean I was impacted by life I was so impacted by life that when he said he was Messiah something of me said that's exactly the truth and I ran into the City and told everyone about it why I was so impacted I mean my life was changed I didn't think I had any future but now I have a future Hallelujah then I went to the upper room and that same one that spoke to me came and dwelt in me now it became the inside voice now it became the inside teacher now it became the inside guide I trust he's done the same thing with you and I friends this morning he's not just externally speaking to you but he's in here amen witnessing the word is Right witnessing that he is the way the truth and the life amen that he becomes the inside Shepherd Hallelujah praise God amen I mean Legion was in tombs he started off he didn't start off that way but he ended up that way it's amazing when you listen to Brother Bear and preach about your from that time people start you know they just say one lie being a child and there's something in them says don't lie to your parents but then they lied and they turn into a compulsive liar and believe their own life and their worlds fall apart just starting from one thing and then so so Legion started off that way something small but then one one Spirit entered him maybe lying another one lust Envy Strife Pride all these things then he had a whole Legion of demons in him amen but life was going to come to show it doesn't matter how fortified a person is doesn't matter how much the Devil May Garrison a person's life they can be complex to their eyeballs and then to the ceiling they can have all kind of doubt and flusterations and demons running their life but remember death cannot stand in the presence of life amen death cannot hold life Hallelujah so then the Lord crossed the sea just for one I'm so glad he crosses the sea for one he crossed the sea for me Hallelujah that's my king amen Hallelujah praise the Lord and then life came to me so impacted by that life he was freed he went back to his family amen normal health is strong and well Hallelujah now I'm so glad life goes beyond Dimensions it's not just affecting these Dimensions you know Lazarus if he could stand it you're saying you know as a friend of Jesus he'd been in our home before there's nothing like his presence but I started to get sick and at first we got doctors and we you know we thought you know it was okay but I was getting worse and worse and I was even we even sent for Jesus to come Mary and Martha I was just on my bed and I couldn't I was barely conscious and they would but I would hear them say it's okay we call for Jesus he's going to come and we prayed and he's going to come we believe you know sometimes we think God doesn't answer our prayers but God answers our prayers I mean he doesn't answer always how we want him to answer but he answers our prayers amen so there he was and he found himself in Paradise he had died he's in fellowship with Abraham Isaac and Jacob all the Believers down through amen Ruth and Hannah and Tamar and different ones but then he heard a voice because remember life and death cannot stay in the same place amen death must always give way to life brother Graham says we see him here on Earth as a conqueror we see him stand here by the side of the grave and Conquer death in that man his soul was four days journey I don't know where he was neither do you but wherever he was he conquered and brought it back corruption knew its Master amen and the soul of this man had been dead and come back and lived again in a mortal body and sat at a table and eat and never a man could do that before he was God's Mighty pardon me conqueror and sickness he never preached a funeral death couldn't stand in his presence how could death and life dwell together they can't do it that's the reason today brother when the church is Born Again of the spirit of God death and life can't hold together something takes place Christ comes in and conquers our passions he conquers our desires he conquers all that's ungodly about us and because he lives we live also he conquers everything that's ungodly he already did it it's laying in our hands just to receive hey man so so Lazarus was four days in the grave but then he heard the voice of the master he's having Fellowship of Abraham Isaac and Jacob having a wonderful time but then he heard the master call him by by name he says I've got to go Hallelujah and actually his voice made him move dimensions made him change worlds just like the voice of God in this generation will cause us to go from this world to the next World Hallelujah why because the the voice of God has power in it to make people change from this Dimension to another dimension hallelu we've already received that voice amen that transforming power it's already Within You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man it's not something external it's more than just a voice on tape no it's a voice behind the voice amen the quickener of the word that makes it live in our lives Hallelujah amen now let's ask his enemies oh I really enjoyed this I hope you enjoy it too let's ask his enemies let's call death up let's call death to testify and he's got to tell the truth Hallelujah you have death could stand here and say I had Adam I had Adam's Fallen race all the way down from Adam and Eve every one of them I had my Stinger and I put my Stinger in them pulled it out and they died and they've had a sting and I was unconquerable nothing could none of the prophets all the great prophets though they though they doubt you know you know they beat up my you know your your demons in trouble and cast me out and did all these kind of troubles everywhere but yet they came to their last breath I stuck them Hallelujah and I had Victory out of every one of them amen only Elijah and Enoch got away but all the others I got them didn't matter how righteous holy whatever they thought they were I got them but then this man came he's born and he's born in Bethlehem he didn't look like much I thought he's just like all the rest of them I'll get him one day but then he would speak and the dead would come back to life again but I thought that's fine I'll get that one anyway because hey they came back to life but they all have to die I'll still have them eventually Hallelujah but then they came to a point when finally a howling mob Cried Out crucify him and then he was he was condemned to die by pilate pilate washed his hands but you can't wash the blood of Jesus Christ off your hands by fobbing it off amen you've got to get it on your heart that's the only way you can get it off your hands how do you get the blood on your heart give your life to him amen so then now he was he was condensed that they they put a crown of thorns on his head he was mad more than any man I thought oh clock's ticking I'm gonna get him I'm gonna get him he's caused all kinds of trouble too to to to to my boss Satan and you know all of all the emps and hell and all this trouble he's got a lot of trouble to my team I'm gonna get him I've got the last say that's what death would say I have the last say and then now I see him I'm you know buzzing around him because I know his time is short and then now he's carrying that cross up Calvary and then the bloody you know he loses so much blood out of his body that it was a couple of spots on his row but just went to one big bloody mass he's carrying the cross up and then they and they crucify him and put him up there I think now is my time now's my time and then he said into my into into your hands father I command my spirit and then I went to sting him and I thought this is going to be the most satisfying sting ever it was satisfying to sting Adam and Eve because they had eternal life no Fowler now I can get them and then all the prophets but this one I was looking forward to this one but then when I put my Stinger in unseen hand came and grabbed the Stinger I tried to pull it out I tried to be free but then it ripped out and now I don't have a stinger no more amen I can never be the same death would say I can never be the same now because I can never get my Stinger back death would say I have been impacted by eternal life I've been empty death was impacted by life that day on Calvary amen he could say I can never recover from this I could never recover from this I could never grasping her back I can never buy another one that is irreplaceable and I can never you know we think man we were impacted that day when he found you and I my life could never be the same uh trust you can say my life can never be the same and now death can say my existence can never be the same because of that down Calvary many times you think what did it do to you what did it do to him Hallelujah Hallelujah to the lamb Hallelujah oh my and now for 2 000 years I've tried to sting people and some people are afraid when they die that's normal but now there's a different class of people on the Earth that Apostle Paul caused me a lot of trouble I'm going to torment this guy because all I can do is Buzz now I can't sting all I can do is Buzz so he buzzes around the Apostle Paul I've got him in a dungeon he's hungry he's cold he's chained to a guard I'm just tormenting him because that's all I can do nowadays and then and then I inspire I Inspire Nero to condemn him to die because I just want him off the scene and then now then now the orders come he hears it through the his his prison bars Paul we're going to cut your head off can you hear the grinding of the ax on the on the stone pool it's got your name on it now I think now I've got him he's going to start shaking in his boots it's been all bravado it's been all bravado until now but then he would stand and say death where's your sting Graver is your Victory thanks be to God that gives us a victory I mean I've got a crown of life amen waiting me on the other side and not only me but all those that love his glorious appearing amen and now I just don't understand he goes to the chopping block he puts down his head willingly he's got a smile on his face because he realized in a few moments Halu the one he met him on the road to Damascus amen that life has so impacted him it's gonna take him to Glory Hallelujah and he died in Victory and I don't understand it it's not right this is death speaking now because we understand it right and I've tried this thing and I've tried to do the same for 2 000 years I fed them to Lions but they went willingly I tortured them but yet they rejoiced amen I I I killed their children in front of them I did all kinds of horrible things but yet but yet I could not make them fear death anymore why because God takes away the fear of death amen if you have a fear of death this morning let him take it from you let him settle it because he settled it that down Calvary while he go to Calvary he says I want my children to know you don't need to fear death you don't need to fear hell you don't need to fear judgment I took her that down Calvary amen that you can go up into Glory so you don't need to fear death Hallelujah and then now so so death has never been the same again he's never been the same all he can do is Buzz around and torment us in our minds try to but then when you think of that day that life impacted you Hallelujah remember God doesn't just meet us one time and that's it and now you work it out no life so impacts us and then he guides us like Enoch like David like all the Believers down through that like Paul he guides us all the way down amen now what can we say about this thing I'm just wanting to come to my closing remarks here this morning what can we say about this what should this do to us if we really look it in the face and say our lord Jesus is taken care we've been so impacted by eternal life remember it's not emotionally how you feel what's happened in your soul I mean what's actually your life has changed Direction what's happened life has impacted you so what can we say to this now if life saw impacted all the Believers down Through the Ages that it has kept them it has guided them it has healed them it has watched over them what about you and I this morning what about today amen if we could if we could you know death could say he was never the same he thought he had the Lord Jesus but death could not hold him the grave could not keep him amen hell could not contain him amen he emptied out paradise but he wasn't going to stay in Paradise amen because remember they all died under the blood of bulls and goats wondering they were impacted by the blood of bulls and goats but now the one remember that was pointing to the real blood and that was given on Calvary amen so now that life could impact them in its fullness Hallelujah so death could not hold him the grave could not keep him nothing could contain them Hallelujah and he did all that because of his love towards you and I amen when Adam and Eve fell in the garden Love Came chasing them amen that's why the voice of God came down in the garden to find us because he knew something had happened he knew they had fallen he wasn't surprised but what happened love came down into the garden amen and loved clothed him and lambskins I mean then they walked out of they walked out of Eden with a shadow pointing to a redeemer because the seed of the woman was going to come and under everything right amen so so love cover this in amen and then now what happened on Calvary that was God's love manifested amen God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should not Pierce but have eternal life everlasting life that was God's love Hallelujah and when we can and then we can say now when the love of God I mean when God's life finds us we can say the love of God has found us like the Welsh Revival and we'll sing it at the end they would they would write a song Heroes love us as the ocean loving kindness is the flood that was that was the song written out of the Welsh Revival because they realized that love had found them or life they had been impacted by eternal life and now that was their response to what had happened I'd say that you know here is love because they realized they had found love they had found rather the love of God had found them praise the Lord amen so now what does this what does this all do to us when we take all this into consideration what does it do amen I trust that we can now realize that they that the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest and I thought that's why I come to this point our whole walk because when you receive the Holy Ghost you enter into rest right and that rest is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost so at first you're stressed you're worried you're trying to do things trying to please God your own strength and this and pray this much and listen this much and do all these things this much but then when you meet and when life impacts you just like the Apostle Paul he was trying to do everything in his own strength as a Pharisee insincerity right but then he entered into rest on the road to Damascus amen he realized what it was like to cease from his own works it was now life was now doing the work through him living the Christian life amen so he realized now that the Christian walk of faith is based solidly upon rest I mean that's right amen it's not see a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things amen a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary this is from why people are so tossed about I mean that's right oh sickness may come in disappointments but a Christian's at rest knowing this that God's able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything then can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ Our Lord we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to The Anchor Holds amen so so I believe his whole life now is is based upon rest amen CeCe win a Believer comes in contact with life with God himself he rests in God's ability to keep his word and to fulfill it in their lives amen you rest it's not how's this going to work and no no you rest in his ability see that's why we enter into rest because it's no longer us trying to do it it's now him doing it in US amen amen so now when you come into it's like brother Ben when he spoke about Anna because because we could come down go down into the temple sorry sorry Anna was impacted by life she was all blind prophetess but life came her way saying I'm in the temple here right now amen and brother bam says you can't be in spiritual contact with God and ever doubt anything he said in his word why because you've come in contact with life amen so so when you when you come into this rest now you rest in his ability to keep his word and to fulfill it in our lives amen we rest in God's leadership to guide us through all troubles and trials a resting on those things I mean you can rest in his leadership because he is our Shepherd amen we rest in God's Deliverance to set us free from every trap of the devil amen from every complex pain fear and worry we rest in God's Deliverance his power amen and that's why he died on Calvary to release us from all bondage amen from all all sin all Pride all trying to be the big shot all trying to be this and that whatever it is he set us free from all those things we rest in God's provision to provide us all of our needs amen we rest in God's power to save our families praise the lord we rest remember we're resting doesn't matter what's happening on the outside we're resting in God you're able to keep your word amen God just like you're able to put food on the table you're able to save our families amen we rest in his ability to do what we think is naturally impossible amen sometimes we think there's no way it could ever happen but no we rest in his ability amen we rest in God's we rest in the power of God's blood amen we are saved by the blood alone are you resting in that amen amen see it's not it's not the blood salvation is not the blood and our good works that's what the Methodist had that idea because they were armenianism because of yeah churches swung to Calvinism just if you if you're there you're there not there in their extreme predestination and so it was swung the other way but now we've come back into the middle of the road amen amen so we're resting in the power of God's blood alone amen we plead the blood see when we come into trouble what do you do you plead the blood Lord I need your blood to cover me Lord I need the power of your blood to come into my life in a greater way amen Lord we have sickness in the body Lord what do you do you plead the blood however he leads you remember he's the Healer ultimately if he uses doctors music prayer whatever it may be but still he's the Healer but you'll be led right amen see so someone who's not resting in God's power thinks they have to inject their own works and to Merit anything from the Lord that's not resting see humans always want to do what they can do but no we should be resting in his ability what what does that mean I just don't need to read the Bible and I just quit no you seek his face with all your heart you love him with all remember worship is not singing Only worship is a life how we treat our families should be a worship how we treat one another should be a worship how we treat the people on the street it should be a worship well giving glory to God and everything we do amen so we don't want to try and we don't need to earn anything God's paid it all see Calvary paid paid for every promise Hallelujah amen but we must rest in his ability to bring his word to pass amen see it's just like Moses when he was put in the put in the ark you know in the nail put in that little Reed basket Amen Brother Bear says it's like little Moses out there looking up towards the Starlet skies at night when the wind is blowing and Howling across the places the old dial jumping and crocodiles going near the basket Hallelujah safe and protected standing between there was an atonement between him and all the gals and heavy winds and the dead that the devil could send nothing could upset that little Ark he floated right on through I can see it great I can see the great holy spirit standing above it I can see the angels of God sitting near with their sword straw no sir nothing's going to touch it I can see the devil trying to sink the ark up there and Noah singing Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross whatever it was all the devils and Hell couldn't take it because it was built according to God's instructions there's an atonement made between judgment and mercy that's every believer today no matter how hard it may seem how hard life may seem as long as you're in Christ Jesus there's nothing present there's nothing future can can reach your soul and separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus amen the devil will turn every gal and Hell loose on you but God has got an atonement standing between you you'll float every wave you'll go through every alligator bed so just like Moses taking from the Nile there he went through alligator beds all kinds of troubles but there was you know brother dramatizes God says Gabriel stand on this Ark amen if any crocodile comes just go kick him in the nose and he puts Angels down every either side of the nail aiming to protect Moses to get him to where he needs to go amen now if God can look out after a baby and an alligator infested nail can't he protect us on life's journey through this demon-infested world Amen because remember he knows where we're gonna go right so we can trust in him doesn't matter how bad you're like who's in like National Geographic you know you see like a river or you see a lake there's more crocodiles in there than water have you seen that it's like man are you sure there's a lake here all I see is crocodile right now Moses could have literally gone over all of those he wasn't going to get eaten he had to get to the pharaoh's Palace Hallelujah because God remember it's not because his mother said Lord may he get this because God said I I'm going to put him there I'm going to nothing can change what I've said it's the same thing with you and I we can be literally walking on alligators the devil's right we can be literally in the worst part of the river this is this is the place you don't go swimming but yet somehow we find ourselves God's led us into this infested place we as safe as safe can be oh yeah we can rest see can we rest in his protection remember nothing can harm us to God nothing can take us from this world into God's purpose is done amen doesn't matter what comes against us nothing can take us to God's purposes done hallelujah so we can rest we can rest in his protection we can rest in his leadership we can rest in his power to save and deliver amen we'll go through every alligator bed but we won't stay there oh Lou so I've got to read a few more here see he says in an absolute and to me it's a very powerful powerful service because he takes in the absolute one of them he'd take nothing can separate us from the love of Christ nothing he says now that becomes an absolute when you when life impacts you you realize that nothing can separate you from the love of God nothing can Hallelujah amen so now he says here he says now without controversy first Timothy 3 16 great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh scene of angels received up into Glory he was God come to take the sinner's place yes sir and when God raised him up on the third day for our justification therefore exalted at the right hand of the Majesty on high he is an intercessor to make intercessions for our weaknesses as we confess it to him and die out to ourself placing his word placing his word back in us the promise and our faith makes the world live because Christ is in us the quickener of the word amen so when his life comes into US was that we get the faith of God does that mean amen but what happens is he now quickens the word in our lives he says how I wish the church could see that all arguments and strife would be over that would be the Supreme Court that's the North Star Hallelujah that's the end of all Strife that's the end of all questions I mean that's the end of everything God said so that's the absolute tie yourself to it Paul said there's nothing present nothing future death sickness nakedness Peril nothing can separate us from that we're tied to an absolute for me to live as Christ to die is gay nothing else holds but that there this that is the absolute amen so when we come to that place we realize that he is our absolute that he puts a faith in our lives to Quicken his word in our lives and he makes intercession on our behalf what happens then all arguments and strife should be over all worry all trouble should be over because why he is making indecision on our behalf that's what life does life intercedes life and deceits amen Hallelujah and he comes and quickens his word in our lives and makes it live amen so therefore all argument and strife would be over if we could just see that maybe I've maybe I've a lack of language to to to put it across but if we had such faith in God I believe we do if we're such rest in him then all of it and then we've been impacted by life well not all arguments are Strife be over yeah am I going to make it am I not going to make it am I going to well has life impacted you has his word impacted you well then all Stripes should be over amen well then what do you do now walk in Victory walk in Victory in life why because death is swallowed up in Victory amen that the Stinger of death is gone we can walk free amen he's taken all fear out of our hearts you say well I'm afraid don't be caught up in fear the Devil Went no look at what God has done amen look at his promises amen he's look at his love towards us he hasn't put us on the earth to condemn us no he's put us on the earth to redeem us because we're part of him and if we realize we're part of him that we could just Rejoice say thank you for this thank you for Easter thank you for Calvary thank you for your atoning blood I mean thank you that you allowed me to be impacted by your life just like the Believers down Through the Ages amen as you led David you led me as you walked with Enoch you'll walk with me amen as you walked with Abraham you'll walk with me amen as you called Lazarus you've called me hallelujah amen praise the lord we can Rejoice this morning I think amen maybe some of you feel a bit I don't know but yeah we can Rejoice don't look at your troubles look at him I mean don't look at your Strife look at his blood I mean don't look at what you see with your natural eye don't be caught up in fusses in discontentment and trouble look at his promises I mean rest in his ability amen
