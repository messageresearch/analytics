and where's the birthday girl happy birthday God bless you amen God bless you richly amen may the Lord bless you pour in 100f of all that you do for everyone amen appreciate it so much thank you amen praise the Lord let's um let's go to uh we want to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 1-6 tonight sorry I don't have a slideshow um this is our last Wednesday service before Camp so next weekend is Camp who's excited for Camp amen praise God so next Wednesday we're going to be packing up sound and all those things we W have a midweek service before camp or after camp and then um after the service on Sunday we'll have a quick meeting about who's doing what and everything to you know for camp and so on Amen so let's uh read from Ezekiel 28: 1 6 I know it's a prayer meeting night so I'll try and be try and be brief um but I thought that's such a fitting song I give myself away that you can use me because there's a question uh we're all gifted people amen we all have a gift and the question I want to pose to you tonight is uh is God using the gift or are you using it so I thought the song's good amen to to go on this so Ezekiel 28: 1-6 says the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou H has said I am a God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God thou Hast set thine heart as the heart of God behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and with thy understanding notice what he's done with it thou has gotten the riches thou has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic thou um hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus sayith the Lord God because thou H has set thine heart as the heart of God I just want to leave finish reading there and then we're going to go to Luke uh 7 and 36 and I pray the Lord tie this together because there's the question of a using the gift or is God using it and then I want to kind of subtitle it the evolution of a Pharisee this may be kind of a we're having a Prem meeting about this this is where we are so Luke 7 and 36 very familiar piece of scripture here uh where where the Lord is Anointed amen the alabaster box the woman in the alabaster box we're just going to read a couple of uh verses here not the whole uh story but yeah Luke 736 to39 and it says here and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed her his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner a amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer if you want to be remembered to prayer just raise your hand to the Lord tonight amen gracious father you see all the hands that are raised and Lord we just want to give ourselves away to you that you can use us oh God like never before thank you Father we can gather in this manner Lord I pray dear God you'd anoint speaker and hearer one more time lord as we have this midweek service this prayer meeting Lord I pray you just take over lord father may you bind every unclean Spirit that's not of you in the name of Jesus Christ I pray your blood would cover us all Lord those here and those who may be watching by the way of YouTube and may you just have preeminence in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may have your seats tonight so yeah so that's my question is God using the gift or are you using it we know that everyone has a gift in their lives and whether it may be preaching music it could be helps governments you we know every everyone has a gift of faith in their lives but you know notice here as as as uh God would God would speak through Ezekiel to the king of Tyrus is isn't it amazing that this man was wiser than Daniel now Daniel was a very wise man you know God he knew how to you know you know uh he God showed him from from his time to the time of the end you know through the Gentile dispensations he showed him many things he showed him the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had that even Nebuchadnezzar didn't even know the dream you know he's full of wisdom and understanding was Daniel but yet this man was wiser than Daniel and it goes to show as the Bible would tell us that gifts and callings are without repentance so it's got nothing to do a gift or you know a gift in a person's life has nothing to do with where they surrender to God not surrender to God we're born with a gift now this man was a very a was a very very wise man to be wiser than Daniel wouldn't you like the wisdom of Daniel amen amen wouldn't you like that kind of wisdom understanding to walk in a gentile world Amen and be undefiled by it I Believe by the blood of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can walk that way am me but you see this man was was wiser than Daniel but you as we read through there you I'm sure you could notice now that that that he used that gift in his life to gather Treasures to himself he used that gift in his life not that God would be glorified but that he himself would be glorified and he got so lifted up in Pride that he says I sit as a God and he even says that I have set my heart as the heart of God what a terrible position to be in to think that my heart's like God's heart in in his own ability am mean what a what a terrible thing to use a Incredible Gift for just ill gotten gain that is going to be vaporized anyway I mean but but but this is what this man had had done and and so it's amazing where a person can be a very gifted person but they can they can instead of surrendering their life to the Lord and letting God use that gift they will use it Satan will allow them to use it to build a kingdom around themselves amen and you know we we never want to come into this kind of position you know brother Bram would tell us that you know a family can start out you know and they can start going to church God can heal the little family he can bless them with the Holy Spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed father and mother will join hands and pray and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family but let me see the first thing you know they didn't have nothing an old junk car maybe riding around in maybe walking finally they'll get a good CH car a better home the first thing you know they'll want to go with what they call the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence you know I don't believe that king of tus would have started off being how he ended up you know like Solomon he didn't he didn't start how he ended and but but we want to end how
