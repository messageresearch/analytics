[7:19] [Music]
[8:02] good
[8:02] morning how are
[8:05] you you um are believers this
[8:09] morning the principle of the word of God
[8:13] is the Lord said You shall know the
[8:15] truth and the truth shall make you
[8:18] free
[8:20] and the mercy of God is that we would
[8:24] understand what the truth is because if
[8:27] you don't know what the truth is then
[8:29] how can you go in any sort of direction
[8:31] towards the truth so the the
[8:34] first uh mercy of God is to let us know
[8:38] what the truth is that then enables us
[8:40] to say well then that's what I want and
[8:43] then faith can then take a hold and walk
[8:46] in the direction of that truth walk in
[8:49] it but we have to walk in it see
[8:51] footsteps are possession you could know
[8:53] the truth and stand here and never walk
[8:54] in it and the truth could be anything to
[8:57] make you free like you could be going
[8:58] down
[9:00] uh a a road and living in adultery or
[9:02] something like that as an extreme case
[9:04] but until you get told the truth that
[9:06] it's wrong you'll always walk that way
[9:07] but when the Lord shows you it's wrong
[9:09] you think well what's right oh this is
[9:11] right then I can walk that way but
[9:14] remember in every single thing in the
[9:15] word of God footsteps are
[9:19] possession so so if you want anything at
[9:22] all in the scriptures any promise of God
[9:25] is yours and once you see it it's yours
[9:27] to to possess
[9:30] it's yours to possess the only thing
[9:32] stopping you from possessing it is you
[9:35] me we don't
[9:37] go that's the only thing that ever stops
[9:40] us attaining to any promise in the word
[9:42] of God is that we don't just walk
[9:43] forward into it that's that's the only
[9:45] thing and Satan's whole Ploy is to tell
[9:48] you don't take that step that's his
[9:51] whole scheme cuz he knows the moment you
[9:53] do that's it you're getting it and you
[9:55] have he knows we have the ability to
[9:57] walk forward into every promise of the
[9:58] word of God God and and so that means we
[10:02] are believers because we believe his
[10:03] word and then we're also soldiers
[10:05] because we just move forward and
[10:08] everything
[10:09] everything any promise of the word of
[10:11] God don't don't have any fear just walk
[10:13] forward into it and and if we walk
[10:15] forward we possess it the minute we walk
[10:18] forward we possess it don't don't matter
[10:20] what the devil tells you or trying to
[10:22] push you back you just walk forward and
[10:23] possess it every promise in the word of
[10:25] God so if there's anything in your life
[10:27] that even the devil might said you you
[10:29] can never have that that's an absolute
[10:31] lie you can have
[10:32] everything all things according to the
[10:34] word of God are ours and and we've been
[10:37] given a word that has shown us what we
[10:39] what we
[10:40] possess so we just walk in it and that's
[10:43] how we just get Victory after Victory
[10:45] hey sometimes the battle gets hot and
[10:46] heavy cuz there's an enemy that wants to
[10:48] stop us from getting it but we just
[10:49] press on cuz we win every battle amen
[10:52] let's um stand this morning and just
[10:54] invite the Lord here Heavenly Father
[10:56] we're so grateful to be in the company
[10:58] of believers Lord and we want to just

[11:29] that's too hard for you to get no it's
[11:31] been too long you you'll never get that
[11:33] all of these things are just lies from
[11:35] Satan and we want to rebuke those lies
[11:37] Lord and just accept your truth Lord
[11:39] that we will know the truth and the
[11:41] truth will set us free Lord Lord and
[11:43] that we can possess all things Lord

[11:52] faith so we just pray you'd bless our

[41:54] amen so I want to speak about Christian
[41:56] grit I was talking to I think a couple
[41:59] of weeks ago I said to Christine I want
[42:00] to talk about grit am me so here we are
[42:02] so it's basically a part two of a couple
[42:04] of Sundays ago where I speaking about
[42:06] don't don't uh don't pull back but press
[42:08] forward mean because we're living in an
[42:10] incredible time you know this is such a
[42:12] great this is the greatest age to be
[42:14] alive in amen this is the best time to
[42:16] be alive this is even better than being
[42:18] here in the when Jesus was in the days
[42:20] of his flesh that wouldn't have made
[42:22] that would have been a great day but
[42:23] this is a better day amen because we're
[42:25] going to see the in Christ raised amen
[42:27] our bodies are going to be changed and
[42:29] we're going to be with them caught up to
[42:30] meet the Lord in the air amen so I'm so
[42:33] thankful that we're not waiting for a
[42:34] you know we don't have to wait 2,000
[42:36] years you know it would be great to be
[42:38] waiting in Paradise sure but isn't it
[42:40] amazing we can be a people who don't
[42:42] taste death necessarily and even if we
[42:44] do taste death well we can't lose amen
[42:47] because amen because we're going to get
[42:49] there anyway right so doesn't matter
[42:51] what happens to this Natural Body amen
[42:53] if there's that if God has has birthed
[42:55] your soul into his Kingdom you're in a
[42:57] good condition amen so a grit you know
[42:59] grit um this is from Psychology today
[43:02] not that we're preaching psychology but
[43:04] I just got this grit is a construct that
[43:07] is said to summon both passion and
[43:09] perseverance in service of a long-term
[43:12] goal it's a marathon not a Sprint as
[43:14] they say in other words gritty people
[43:16] put in sustained effort over time to
[43:18] achieve a high level of of success in
[43:21] their chosen domain now this is just
[43:23] naturally speaking but you know so how
[43:25] much more you know people can can can
[43:28] give their whole lives over to a goal
[43:29] you know Elon Musk wants to go to Mars
[43:32] other people want to go to the moon and
[43:33] you know their whole lives have just
[43:35] been focused on that one goal that's all
[43:37] they're that's all they're interested in
[43:39] am mean but so so if people can do that
[43:40] naturally how much more Supernatural
[43:42] people amen who are who are here that
[43:45] God can anoint them that he can live his
[43:47] word through them amen that they can be
[43:49] the final voice to the final age I mean
[43:51] how much more people that are made in
[43:53] His image washed in his blood you see
[43:55] it's one thing to say Lord you know like
[43:58] the blind man who was born blind it was
[44:00] one thing to say yes I'm that blind man
[44:02] but then when Jesus touched him amen and
[44:04] eyes came open he didn't speak the same
[44:07] way he spoke before Jesus touched him I
[44:09] mean he spoke a different kind of a
[44:10] language he had a different kind of a
[44:12] walk he had a different kind of
[44:13] experience because the master found him
[44:15] and touched him amen and he said this is
[44:18] all I know I was blind but now I see I
[44:21] was once blind but I'm not blind anymore
[44:24] maybe people would say oh you're that
[44:25] blind man the gate he'd say no I'm not
[44:27] that blind man I was that blind man but
[44:29] now I'm a seeing man I mean I can see
[44:31] the supernatural I can see the power of
[44:33] God I can see God in his word in this
[44:35] day I just made a Quantum Leap from that
[44:37] man to you amen but you know we're going
[44:39] to realize that you know God has built
[44:41] us to overcome in this day am mean God
[44:43] has made us with a grit this is I'm not
[44:45] talking about human grit I'm not talking
[44:47] about a you a force of a will you know
[44:49] of just a human ambition this is far
[44:51] greater than that amen but we've been
[44:53] built Amen to have a passion
[44:56] and a perseverance Amen in a marathon
[44:59] amen we are we are long-distance Runners
[45:01] amen we are built to be longdistance
[45:04] Runners amen with this race praise God
[45:07] that's right Hallelujah because we got
[45:08] to realize that we're living in a day
[45:10] where where where dimensions are merging
[45:12] together that's right am mean you see
[45:14] hell upon the Earth it's very evident we
[45:16] can say that demon power has been
[45:17] released in this day we can see that
[45:19] there's no stretch to the imagination
[45:21] but you know brother Brown would say
[45:23] that as as hell has turned loose upon
[45:24] the Earth all of Heaven is turn loose
[45:26] also amen so there's a merging of
[45:28] Dimensions going on right now amen in
[45:31] this day and so hell's upon the Earth
[45:33] but Heaven here also amen so we're not
[45:35] here amen by ourselves trying to get by
[45:38] just trying to scrape through lady OA no
[45:40] we're built to overcome God has made us
[45:43] to overcome he's made you that way we're
[45:45] going to you got to realize you're a
[45:46] champion this morning because the
[45:48] champion of champions came down from
[45:50] glory and he conquered hell death in the
[45:52] grave for you and that Spirit of victory
[45:54] that was in him with the AP ISM of the
[45:56] Holy Ghost comes into you and you become
[45:58] an overcomer amen so we are champions
[46:01] today cuz he's made us a champion
[46:03] remember he caus us always to Triumph in
[46:05] Christ Jesus hallelujah amen if I speak
[46:09] too fast get too excited well just come
[46:11] with me you know we have a living God
[46:14] Amen he's alive amen hallelujah we don't
[46:17] serve a tradition we don't serve a nice
[46:19] idea we serve the true and living God
[46:21] I'm not trying to pump you up or make
[46:23] you excited we just got to let God
[46:25] Quicken to us the reality of who he is
[46:28] and who we are in him amen because if we
[46:31] look at the natural things like the
[46:32] servant of of of Elisha we'll get
[46:35] perplexed we'll be troubled amen the
[46:37] enemy's here to get us we're in trouble
[46:39] you know they were stuck in that City
[46:40] they could not get out he was he was all
[46:42] concerned what are we going to do now
[46:45] and then so the prophet he prayed Open
[46:47] Lord open the young man's eyes now his
[46:51] prayer did not bring the Angels down
[46:53] amen his prayer did not his prayer
[46:55] didn't bring the angel down the armies
[46:57] of Heaven were already there am mean
[46:59] before before the syrians turned up the
[47:01] armies were there I mean before the
[47:03] young men went out and started to panic
[47:05] the Army was there I mean before the
[47:07] prophet prayed the armies of Heaven were
[47:10] already there but just took the opening
[47:12] of the eyes Amen to show what the
[47:14] reality of the situation see many times
[47:17] we just see the enemy around about we
[47:18] see troubles and and depression and
[47:20] problems and anxiety and economic
[47:23] problems and all these different things
[47:25] but our eyes need to come open to the re
[47:27] that's not the reality of the situation
[47:30] amen our God is Jehovah Gyra amen he
[47:33] will provide he has provided amen amen
[47:36] he is Jehovah Shalom he is our peace
[47:38] amen he's a peace that passs all
[47:40] understanding he's Jehovah Rafa he's our
[47:42] healer he's our Banner he's our buckler
[47:44] he's our Shield I mean and the reason he
[47:46] is those things is because he is Jehovah
[47:48] shamama which means the Lord is present
[47:51] amen if he is present all of his
[47:53] attributes are present amen so if all of
[47:55] us attribute to present amen it's
[47:57] because then we can tap into
[48:00] them amen if you're just scratching the
[48:02] top two inches of your scale trying to
[48:04] find the solution amen that's as far as
[48:07] you'll go but if you can realize you can
[48:08] tap into the mind of God I mean you can
[48:11] seek God In Prayer say Lord I need the
[48:13] answer to this amen you can be
[48:15] persevering and pursue God am me for his
[48:17] answer amen then it'll go beyond your
[48:19] top two inches and you'll get God's mind
[48:21] in the
[48:22] situation Hallelujah so so he prayed and
[48:26] then see God opened this boy's eyes and
[48:28] when his eyes come open the mountains
[48:30] was on fire and angels are fire chars of
[48:33] fire sure he's
[48:35] here amen now and he says and when
[48:39] Christian Believers can believe that
[48:40] present now right now sitting together
[48:43] seated here in Heavenly places in Christ
[48:45] Jesus in Christ Jesus fellowshipping
[48:47] amen around the word of God the Holy
[48:49] Spirit here taking the word by Vision
[48:51] word of God by Vision moving it out into
[48:53] every heart like that as the word is
[48:55] going forth and every believer receiving
[48:57] it oh if we could stand and claim our
[49:00] god-given
[49:01] privileges that's the time that God can
[49:04] take can ever take that Wishbone out of
[49:06] a person's back and put a real
[49:08] old-fashioned gospel backbone into him
[49:10] somebody he'll stand for truth no matter
[49:12] how dark it looks amen so if you want
[49:15] your Wishbone to be replaced by a gospel
[49:17] backbone amen just stand up and claim
[49:20] your god-given privileges am me because
[49:22] if you realize that every promise of God
[49:24] is yours it's been given to you remember
[49:27] the devil didn't give it so he can't
[49:30] keep it the devil didn't give it so he
[49:32] can't keep it God gave it and he and he
[49:34] wants you to receive it am mean so
[49:36] instead of taking a wishbone of I wish
[49:38] God would do something and I wish he
[49:39] could do this and I wish he could do
[49:41] that in order to get rid of that and a
[49:44] real backbone that God's word is true
[49:46] and I'm going to stand on his promise
[49:48] claim your god-given privilege if you
[49:50] got a jellyfish kind of a Christianity
[49:52] and you want a real backbone just take
[49:54] your god-given privilege amen amen
[49:56] that's what brother B saying here amen
[49:58] if you want to get rid of a wishbone and
[50:00] get a backbone claim your god-given
[50:02] privileges right now amen or maybe one
[50:06] day no no now today's the day of
[50:08] salvation today's the day of healing
[50:10] today's the days of Deliverance amen you
[50:12] say it's impossible nothing's impossible
[50:15] with God nothing's impossible he made
[50:17] the body you live in he made this
[50:19] building amen he made this planet he
[50:22] made the solar system he made the
[50:24] universe he made everything what's your
[50:26] problem compared to that amen God can do
[50:29] it amen nothing can defeat Our God Amen
[50:31] our God is he cannot be conquered and he
[50:35] cannot liej and if he said it he can do
[50:37] it amen so we got to have a real grit to
[50:41] say yes Lord I believe your word I'm not
[50:44] going to sit back and let the devil
[50:46] Bluff me out of any promise I'm not
[50:48] going to sit here in the stale made of a
[50:50] you know Israel got to a point that
[50:52] we're going to dismantle Hummer people
[50:54] say it can't be done if theyve got
[50:55] enough grit they'll do it that's if
[50:57] they've got enough grit and
[50:58] determination they will dismantle that
[51:00] thing but they've got to have
[51:02] determination to do it they got to have
[51:03] a vision amen if you got a vision you
[51:05] can do it amen you got to have a vision
[51:07] of the word living in your life amen you
[51:09] got have a vision of angels visiting
[51:11] your home you have a vision of your
[51:12] children receiving the Holy Ghost you
[51:14] have a vision of healing you got to have
[51:15] a vision of those things and if you and
[51:17] let your life Focus onto that vision and
[51:20] God will manifest that Vision see Caleb
[51:22] got a vision of his Mountain he says
[51:24] that's my mountain that's my promise
[51:26] that's my inheritance and he went and
[51:28] got it the other spies only had a vision
[51:30] of the enemy but Caleb had a vision of
[51:32] the promise amen just like Joshua so if
[51:34] we have a vision of the promise God can
[51:37] give us that promise amen let's not look
[51:39] at the problems our God is bigger than
[51:41] the problems our God is bigger than our
[51:43] complex he's bigger than our natural
[51:44] traits he's bigger than our human DNA
[51:47] he's greater than those things so let's
[51:49] not look at those things amen I read an
[51:51] article the other day where you know
[51:53] people you talking about
[51:56] problems in people's Spirits just on a
[51:57] psychological level and they were
[51:59] raising the question have we opened a
[52:01] box where people diagnose themselves
[52:03] with things they don't really have cuz
[52:05] you know I was talking to someone on the
[52:06] phone the other day and they said they
[52:08] don't diagnose their um um medical
[52:10] problems by Google because you Google
[52:13] can turn a a cough into a cancer right
[52:15] you know it could be a ter Google can
[52:18] say you're terminal but really you just
[52:20] got a rash you know so so but but
[52:23] psychologically people are raising
[52:24] questions how we open this box too much
[52:27] that people diagnose well I've got this
[52:29] personality disorder I've got this
[52:31] problem and people focus on their
[52:33] problems are not the solution amen who
[52:35] cares honestly sure you know if it gives
[52:37] you peace they say l there should be one
[52:41] label we have redeemed saved
[52:46] Sanctified May Mrs Jesus Christ amen
[52:49] that should be the label of your life if
[52:50] you want a if you want a diagnosis of
[52:52] you it should be saved clean
[52:56] amen a new
[52:58] creature not this person they disorder
[53:01] or this or this or this God will deal
[53:03] with those things but you got to
[53:05] identify yourself in the scripture as
[53:07] part of him when you identify yourself
[53:09] in the scripture as part of him then God
[53:11] will take that Faith quick in that word
[53:13] and make it live in your life amen you
[53:15] can see that's why people when they go
[53:16] get baptized they believe Jesus saved
[53:18] them so they act upon it right amen you
[53:21] believe you Jesus healed you you get
[53:23] anointed you get prayer whatever more
[53:25] but you believe he's done it so you act
[53:27] upon the faith that he's done it amen so
[53:28] we've got to act upon the faith that God
[53:30] has taking care of me that whatever I
[53:32] may have in hear it from my natural
[53:34] lineage that's going to be done away
[53:36] with and it's not the focus of my life
[53:38] amen just as Jonah would say those that
[53:41] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[53:43] Mercy on Amen so we don't want to be
[53:45] observing lying vanities amen doesn't
[53:47] matter how real it may be how much you
[53:49] feel it how much you imagine it if it's
[53:52] contrary to the word of God it's a lying
[53:54] vanity am huah yes sir hallelujah amen
[53:58] so let's have a good oldfashioned gospel
[53:59] backbone I believe I'm preaching to the
[54:01] choir right but let's have a real grit
[54:04] we can fully dismantle the devil's work
[54:07] we can fully dismantle Hamas in the
[54:09] spiritual amen I mean we don't have to
[54:11] have a peace treaty we don't have just
[54:12] to try and feed some off some part in
[54:14] our life we can dismantle them am mean
[54:17] we have the fire power Hallelujah we
[54:20] have air superiority amen we have the
[54:22] intelligence amen we got all the weapons
[54:25] to fully dismantle the devil in our
[54:27] lives amen but it takes a real grit and
[54:29] what does that really that grit boil
[54:30] down to a a death to self a death to
[54:34] self that you don't reason to agree with
[54:36] carnality you reason to agree with God's
[54:38] word amen because if you if we agree
[54:41] with God's word God's word can be
[54:42] manifested in our lives hallelujah
[54:45] hallelujah now we live in the greatest
[54:47] day there's ever been amen there's never
[54:50] been so much light as today amen shining
[54:53] amen amen now it's it's it's when the
[54:56] word is made manifest that the Bible
[54:59] calls that light just like here in
[55:01] Matthew 4 Jesus and leaving Nazareth he
[55:04] came and dwelt in capernum which is upon
[55:06] the Sea Coast and the borders of Zebula
[55:08] Neilon that it might be fulfilled which
[55:10] was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying
[55:12] the land of zebulun and the land of
[55:14] Niland by the way of the sea Beyond
[55:15] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[55:17] people which sat in darkness saw great
[55:19] light and to them which sat in the
[55:22] region and shadow of death light is
[55:23] sprung up yes from that time Jesus began
[55:26] to preach and say repent for the kingdom
[55:27] of God is at hand amen so so naturally
[55:31] they just saw a man who looked like any
[55:32] other man walking into their land you
[55:35] know but spiritually great light sprang
[55:37] up upon them now they sat in darkness
[55:40] but they just but we got to realize and
[55:42] and they're in the shadow of death but
[55:44] naturally they had families they had
[55:46] synagogue they had their Commerce their
[55:48] businesses all these things but they
[55:50] were sitting in the shadow of death but
[55:52] then great light sprang up upon them
[55:54] because because all the promises of the
[55:56] Messiah were now being made manifest in
[55:58] their day where it was no longer
[56:00] prophecy it was now reality am mean so
[56:03] light sprung up now there's great power
[56:04] in light amen Darkness remember darkness
[56:07] is absence of light that's all darkness
[56:09] is amen as soon as you turn a light on
[56:12] all the darkness goes away amen the the
[56:14] darkness can never overcome the light
[56:17] amen the light is far stronger than the
[56:19] darkness now light has has has has power
[56:22] in it amen it takes light to bring life
[56:26] amen amen it takes light to bring life
[56:29] amen that's why Springtime now well you
[56:31] know the weather who knows it doesn't
[56:33] even know what it's doing but you know
[56:35] we're in springtime amen and and and you
[56:38] can have a garden bed all sorted out
[56:39] during the winter time you can have all
[56:41] you think all the weeds are gone and you
[56:43] know everything's okay amen but then
[56:45] when but then when the sun comes closer
[56:47] to the Earth amen and the temperature
[56:49] begins to raise and then the sun begins
[56:51] to get stronger here upon the Earth
[56:53] those things that you think you have
[56:55] dealt with come to life why because the
[56:58] light of the sun has Shone upon your
[56:59] garden amen because it takes the light
[57:02] of the sun to bring forth natural seed
[57:04] now how much more am mean now that's
[57:06] just the natural now and the
[57:08] supernatural it takes the supernatural
[57:10] light of God to bring the seed of God to
[57:12] life now a seed that is just a seed just
[57:15] only has potentials it can potentially
[57:18] become say a apple tree you know you you
[57:21] you have a seed of an apple potentially
[57:24] it can become a tree
[57:25] right all of the all of the bushels of
[57:28] apples that will ever come out of that
[57:29] tree is in that seed potentially amen
[57:32] but it's got to be planted in the right
[57:33] atmosphere it's got to be watered it's
[57:35] got to have the right sunlight amen for
[57:37] the potential to become reality now the
[57:40] word of God quickens the seed of God I
[57:43] mean that's why it's so important the
[57:44] message of the hour will it's the only
[57:46] thing that can awaken the Bride of this
[57:47] day that's right amen it will the light
[57:50] of the word awakens the bride amen now
[57:52] so so what the what the light does does
[57:55] now is there's a seed and and elect
[57:57] people of the bride of Christ amen that
[57:59] when the light of the word strikes them
[58:02] the potentials become reality amen it's
[58:05] no longer just potentials it becomes
[58:07] into manifestation just like the Apple
[58:09] Tree am mean you plant it comes to life
[58:11] you take the apple and you eat it it's
[58:13] no longer a potential it's manifested
[58:15] you're enjoying the fruit of it amen you
[58:17] see it growing you see it right there
[58:18] you don't have to say well I think the
[58:20] tree will be this tall it'll be this
[58:21] wide the apples will be this flavor no
[58:24] it's no longer potentials it's
[58:25] manifested who's with me today amen so
[58:28] it's the same thing now with the light
[58:30] of this word in the end time amen it m
[58:33] it it it brings to life a seed of
[58:35] predestination I mean there no longer a
[58:38] potentially a bride on the earth it's
[58:40] now reality amen it's now a reality I
[58:43] trust you just walking with me for a
[58:44] little bit because if we realize what
[58:46] God has really done for us am mean what
[58:49] he has really done that he's not just
[58:50] made us a church he's not just made us a
[58:52] different group of people he hasn't just
[58:53] made us a you you a a a kind of a
[58:56] subgroup in society or or however you
[58:58] want to put it but God's word has
[59:00] quickened to us I mean he's made that
[59:02] seed of predestination come to life
[59:04] because he saw within us the potential
[59:07] to be the bride amen and if God sees a
[59:09] potential it doesn't come to a halfway
[59:12] manifestation it'll come to a full
[59:14] manifestation amen but when you realize
[59:16] that you're called for this that the
[59:17] word has awoken you to be the bride of
[59:19] Christ it should give you such a grit
[59:22] amen it should give you such a passion
[59:24] that all of because remember his passion
[59:26] was that day on Calvary and what was his
[59:28] passion for you to be made in His image
[59:31] washed in his blood amen that his
[59:33] potentials go into you amen that now
[59:36] it's not just a man it's now a
[59:38] multimember body amen that are that are
[59:40] manifesting the word of God I mean that
[59:42] was his passion to see you come to your
[59:45] position am mean that you would stand on
[59:46] every neck of the enemy that you would
[59:48] overcome every trouble I mean you could
[59:50] walk in Victory in spite of your
[59:52] Humanity you would walk and you would
[59:53] stand flat footed in every trial that's
[59:56] what his passion was amen and if our
[59:59] passion becomes his passion amen what
[1:00:01] could take place even this morning amen
[1:00:03] that God could come down in a powerful
[1:00:05] way that we wouldn't need just a Sunday
[1:00:07] night at camp but God could come down
[1:00:09] and meet every need hallelujah amen I
[1:00:11] believe it amen because now we are no
[1:00:13] longer potential we're reality amen that
[1:00:16] the word of God the prophecy of the
[1:00:18] Bride is no longer prophecy it's no
[1:00:20] longer just circling around the earth
[1:00:21] waiting for a people but the people are
[1:00:23] here manifesting that promise amen
[1:00:26] hallelujah why because the light has
[1:00:28] quickened remember brother would say you
[1:00:31] know the light didn't couldn't Quicken
[1:00:33] the rock it can't Quicken the dirt it
[1:00:35] quickens the seed amen and you got to
[1:00:38] realize that God built you that way
[1:00:40] doesn't matter how you feel what mind
[1:00:42] battles are going on forget all that
[1:00:44] stuff remember the devil okay let's
[1:00:50] just I'm just trying to behave but let's
[1:00:53] not do that no more amen remember what
[1:00:57] God gave you the devil has no right to
[1:00:59] keep from you he has no right to keep it
[1:01:02] from you so remember so David David had
[1:01:04] an incredible journey right he was
[1:01:07] predestinated to be the king of Israel
[1:01:09] who believes that am mean Samuel did not
[1:01:12] go to Jesse's house and said I'll pick
[1:01:14] one cuz his pick was not God's pick am
[1:01:17] mean before before Samuel ever went to
[1:01:19] Jesse's house before even God told him
[1:01:21] to go there there was a king in that
[1:01:23] family there was a predestinated King
[1:01:25] but you see he needed the light of God
[1:01:28] to Quicken the seed of God that he would
[1:01:30] come to manifestation and so now here he
[1:01:32] is there David just being David but in
[1:01:34] him his kingship right and so now he he
[1:01:38] is so so there's already been prophecy
[1:01:41] that's actually hanging over his life
[1:01:43] because in Genesis if I could find it
[1:01:45] here am mean there's a there's a
[1:01:47] prophecy that that the scepter would not
[1:01:49] depart out of Judah until Shiloh come so
[1:01:51] kingship had to come into the tribe of
[1:01:53] Judah
[1:01:55] amen kingship had to come into the tribe
[1:01:57] of Judah so now so because the son of
[1:02:00] David so because the king the Messiah
[1:02:02] would come out of that tribe and so that
[1:02:05] kingship had to come into Judah and
[1:02:06] David was a manifestation of that where
[1:02:08] the kingship would come into that tribe
[1:02:10] he didn't know that but God knew that
[1:02:13] amen so so there he is just living his
[1:02:14] old kind of a life as a boy as a shepher
[1:02:16] different things but then the light of
[1:02:18] God comes his way through a Vindicated
[1:02:20] Prophet where he takes the Horn of
[1:02:22] anointing oil and pours it out over DAV
[1:02:25] that all the potential in David will
[1:02:26] comes a manifestation in It season amen
[1:02:29] that he would be king that would take
[1:02:31] the fullness of the promise and every
[1:02:32] Divine promise given to Moses would be
[1:02:34] now manifested amen it's the same thing
[1:02:36] with you and I you know you know what
[1:02:37] this message is it's a horn of anointing
[1:02:39] oil amen it's an anointing amen that
[1:02:42] that that a Vindicated Prophet stood
[1:02:43] upon the Earth and poured out amen God
[1:02:46] would use a vessel Amen to pour an
[1:02:47] anointing out am mean cuz there were
[1:02:49] seeds upon the Earth that had to come to
[1:02:51] manifestation seeds of the Bride amen
[1:02:53] seeds of God in Bride form amen this is
[1:02:55] the bride coming of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:58] that when you people should be able to
[1:02:59] see you and see God not your Humanity
[1:03:03] but deity living in you amen that's what
[1:03:05] they should be able to see amen so
[1:03:07] Hallelujah this is what this message is
[1:03:08] it's not just Doctrine it's not just
[1:03:10] restored truth that's all part of it
[1:03:12] it's not just church order and different
[1:03:13] things it's an anointing amen that the
[1:03:16] word of God would put on flesh in you
[1:03:17] and I amen that every it'll be no longer
[1:03:20] prophecy but it become
[1:03:22] manifestation Hallelujah so now David
[1:03:24] David had a lot of struggles in his life
[1:03:27] he had a lot of battles in his life you
[1:03:28] read psalms a lot of them Lord help me
[1:03:31] deliver me from my enemies they can pass
[1:03:33] about me I'm all in trouble and I you
[1:03:35] know my pillows wet with tears and all
[1:03:37] these different things had a lot of
[1:03:38] trouble but that didn't but that did not
[1:03:40] change the fact that he was King you
[1:03:43] know Hallelujah you get anointed by by
[1:03:45] God the devil will come after you David
[1:03:49] was anointed king by all the tribes and
[1:03:50] it says in the Bible that the
[1:03:52] Philistines come to find him oh yes
[1:03:54] that's right right amen but the devil
[1:03:56] but the Philistines got defeated amen so
[1:03:58] when the enemy you know you take one
[1:04:00] foot on Victory and the enemy tries to
[1:04:03] push you off that Victory but you got to
[1:04:05] realize no I'm anointed to stand here I
[1:04:07] mean the devil's not called to stand in
[1:04:08] this promise I'm called to stand in This
[1:04:10] Promise am mean so because he knew he
[1:04:12] was anointed king and he was aligned
[1:04:14] with that prophecy see here the thing we
[1:04:17] got to stay aligned with the word like
[1:04:20] Paul would say many years after the road
[1:04:22] to Damascus I was not disobedient into
[1:04:24] the heavenly vision right so what he is
[1:04:26] called to be he stayed in right David he
[1:04:30] knew his anointed king he stayed right
[1:04:32] with that God's called me so he had
[1:04:36] enough grit to say I'm staying with this
[1:04:38] promise doesn't matter if I'm on the run
[1:04:40] doesn't matter what I or any trouble
[1:04:42] that comes into my life God you have
[1:04:44] prophesied I'm this so he surrendered to
[1:04:47] that prophecy who's with me am mean
[1:04:49] because some people say well if I'm the
[1:04:50] bride God will make me the bride don't
[1:04:52] just sit back if God has given you a
[1:04:55] promise go possess it amen if I said I
[1:04:59] had1 billion and it was yours I think
[1:05:01] you'd be leaving this building and going
[1:05:02] to go get
[1:05:04] it if it was on the other side of the
[1:05:06] world you had to go physically get it
[1:05:07] you would you would you had gone to debt
[1:05:10] I mean you'd give everything come on I
[1:05:14] would if there was $10 billion to me in
[1:05:16] in the UK I'd be buying a ticket somehow
[1:05:18] and I'd be there cuz it's given to me
[1:05:22] right let's no you can't say oh I
[1:05:24] wouldn't do yeah you would you'd be at
[1:05:26] the Wellington airport even if the
[1:05:27] flight's 2 Days Later you'd be waiting
[1:05:29] or you'd be driving up to Oakland you'd
[1:05:30] be doing something crazy because why A
[1:05:33] promise is given to you you're going
[1:05:35] possess that promise amen now that's
[1:05:36] just of the natural how much more
[1:05:38] eternal life how much more every promise
[1:05:40] of God Amen if God has given it then I'm
[1:05:43] going to give all my life I'm going to
[1:05:44] surrender all that I am that I can
[1:05:46] obtain that promise amen like the
[1:05:49] Apostle Paul would say I can't all
[1:05:50] things but dung that I wi Christ you see
[1:05:53] he had grit Amen to count all of his old
[1:05:55] life but dung oh yeah that he would
[1:05:57] possess every Divine promise of God
[1:05:59] hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so David
[1:06:03] David stayed with that that's why he
[1:06:06] didn't try and kill Saul and you know
[1:06:08] maneuver his way into kingship at the
[1:06:10] right time you know because he knew God
[1:06:11] would Place him there at the right time
[1:06:13] but he came to a place where now where
[1:06:16] now he was in Zig now it's amazing how
[1:06:17] in transition there can be great trouble
[1:06:20] here he was Saul Saul had died in battle
[1:06:23] he was now you know going to be be made
[1:06:26] King over Israel but now he lost
[1:06:27] everything when he's about to possess
[1:06:29] everything oh that's an interesting
[1:06:31] thing isn't it you know because there he
[1:06:32] is David Saul's dead on the battlefield
[1:06:35] he comes back to zigg laag he's lost his
[1:06:37] wives he's lost his children not just
[1:06:39] his but his but his men that have fought
[1:06:41] with him for many years and you know he
[1:06:43] comes to a spot where even his own men
[1:06:45] that have gathered to him want to want
[1:06:47] to Stone him and they wept until they
[1:06:49] had no more power to weep amen they they
[1:06:51] were really brokenhearted over these
[1:06:53] things because no doubt during this time
[1:06:55] the devil's filling their imaginations
[1:06:57] with what the enemy is going to do to
[1:06:58] their family could you imagine I mean
[1:07:01] cuz the devil's cruel he's a wicked
[1:07:03] being imagine when they imagine if they
[1:07:06] found out oh this is David's wife this
[1:07:08] is David's children the Wrath I'd pour
[1:07:11] out upon those helpless people because
[1:07:13] of the cruel wickedness of the devil
[1:07:16] right so so no doubt those things would
[1:07:18] be playing on David's mind and also you
[1:07:20] know his men's mind but but David had a
[1:07:23] source of strength you see he had a
[1:07:26] source of strength you know that's why
[1:07:28] he encouraged himself in the Lord amen
[1:07:31] he see see his his source of strength
[1:07:34] wasn't his mental ability his source of
[1:07:36] strength wasn't what he thought he could
[1:07:38] do right his source of strength was the
[1:07:40] Lord who called him to be king amen and
[1:07:43] that's why in times of great trouble he
[1:07:45] didn't forget who he was because he went
[1:07:47] to a source of strength that's why we've
[1:07:49] always got to turn to the Lord in our
[1:07:51] time of need don't turn to people turn
[1:07:53] to God am me cuz remember if God called
[1:07:56] you he's going to place you in that
[1:07:57] predestinated place am mean if he called
[1:07:59] you to become the bride you're going to
[1:08:01] become the bride Hallelujah so so he's
[1:08:03] in this time of great trouble but we got
[1:08:05] to realize you know many times we think
[1:08:07] well you know the devil take something
[1:08:09] from us maybe our joy maybe our peace
[1:08:11] you know maybe a few years ago we were
[1:08:13] shouting running the O now we're like a
[1:08:14] church mouse in the church and because
[1:08:16] the devil's coming and taking taking
[1:08:18] something from us and then he'll tell
[1:08:20] you you don't deserve that you're not
[1:08:22] worthy of that thing amen you went too
[1:08:24] far and you can't get it back and he'll
[1:08:26] give you all the reasons why you can't
[1:08:28] possess it amen but then you've got to
[1:08:30] realize the devil didn't give it to you
[1:08:32] in the first place amen he didn't give
[1:08:34] it to you in the first place so he has
[1:08:36] no right to keep it from you amen if God
[1:08:38] gave it to you he wants you to keep it
[1:08:40] amen he wants you to possess it he wants
[1:08:42] you to enjoy it amen so if you had a
[1:08:44] shout before you can go back and get
[1:08:45] your shout amen if you had Joy before
[1:08:47] you can go back and get your joy and
[1:08:49] mean the devil has no right to keep it
[1:08:51] from you whatsoever it's yours
[1:08:53] hallelujah amen you got to realize that
[1:08:55] amen something's been taken from you you
[1:08:57] have right to go get it cuz God gave it
[1:08:59] to you the devil didn't give you it God
[1:09:01] gave it to you and God wants you to
[1:09:03] possess it amen that's why you've got to
[1:09:05] have enough grit to go get it back may
[1:09:08] take some time in prayer whatever it
[1:09:09] takes you say Lord I want it back I want
[1:09:11] the peace of God that P will understand
[1:09:13] to to rule my life I want my joy back I
[1:09:16] want my shout back amen because it's
[1:09:18] mine amen it's mine I want it hallelujah
[1:09:20] hallelujah amen I don't want to just sit
[1:09:22] here and remember the could bees of life
[1:09:25] no we're not ordained to live that way
[1:09:28] Hallelujah Lord we don't live with a
[1:09:33] memory the devil lives with a memory he
[1:09:36] remembers what it was like to be the
[1:09:37] anointed J that coverthe what it was
[1:09:40] like to be God's right-hand man he can
[1:09:42] never go back there he's going to burn
[1:09:45] up we have a
[1:09:48] memory of where we came from that's why
[1:09:51] God's revealed it to us right but we
[1:09:53] don't live I hope I'm not tripping
[1:09:55] myself up here but we don't live by
[1:09:57] memory of what we used to have only the
[1:09:59] devil could only live by that memory of
[1:10:01] what he used to be he wants to be like
[1:10:03] the most high he'll never become that
[1:10:05] way like he wants to be because we're
[1:10:07] here right God has always had a witness
[1:10:10] he wants to get rid of the seed of God
[1:10:12] then he can become what he really wants
[1:10:13] to be but there's a people upon the
[1:10:15] Earth that won't bow to the devil amen
[1:10:17] but you see now us we don't just live
[1:10:19] with a memory we live with the present
[1:10:21] God Amen am mean we don't have to look
[1:10:23] back and say well I used to I used to I
[1:10:25] used to pray I used to cry I used to be
[1:10:27] so happy I used to have so much peace I
[1:10:30] used to look at the world and everything
[1:10:31] was awesome because God's Alive and I
[1:10:32] saw him in his nature and his Universe I
[1:10:34] saw him in me I saw him in his son it's
[1:10:37] not just a you you don't have to live in
[1:10:38] a used to kind of a way well when I was
[1:10:40] younger I used to what about now I mean
[1:10:43] what about now I believe David's
[1:10:45] greatest Psalms were written in the time
[1:10:46] of greatest trouble amen because he
[1:10:49] could stand in that trouble and know God
[1:10:51] called him to go through the trouble

[1:13:45] we're not on the bad side amen that we
[1:13:46] don't just have a twing all let's just
[1:13:49] let's just let's just not talk about
[1:13:50] that you know no we've been liberated
[1:13:53] been translated to the kingdom of his
[1:13:54] dear son
[1:13:56] hallelujah amen so I think we can
[1:13:59] Rejoice see the devil has a lot of
[1:14:00] trauma but we can just rejoice in what
[1:14:02] God has done amen amen now the word made
[1:14:07] manifest as light now we know that we're
[1:14:11] living in the day where there's the
[1:14:12] greatest light shining we're living in
[1:14:15] Bible days yes sir right we're living in
[1:14:17] a time when the son of man has been
[1:14:19] revealed through a prophetic Ministry
[1:14:21] amen the hearts of the children have
[1:14:22] been turned back to the hearts of the
[1:14:24] fathers through the message of the hour
[1:14:26] am me you got to look at what the what
[1:14:27] this message has has has said it will
[1:14:30] produce is producing it amen you you got
[1:14:33] to look at now you going to say I am the
[1:14:34] product of God's Amazing Grace amen I'm
[1:14:37] the product of it I didn't just talk
[1:14:38] about it I'm the product of it I mean
[1:14:41] why because God has put a faith in my
[1:14:43] life let's just let's just all focus in
[1:14:47] God's put a faith in our life that's
[1:14:50] overcoming Faith God's put a faith in
[1:14:52] our life to overcome every trouble you
[1:14:55] may have a lot of trouble right now but
[1:14:56] remember don't let the
[1:14:58] devil keep you under guilt don't let
[1:15:02] them keep you under shame okay we were
[1:15:06] all in darkness once upon a time we may
[1:15:08] even willfully go and trip up but if we
[1:15:11] say Lord pick me up again try me again
[1:15:14] forgive me Lord there's enough blood to
[1:15:17] keep you for every day of your life
[1:15:21] right it's not just for when you get
[1:15:22] saved it's for every day there's a he's
[1:15:25] making intercession on your behalf amen
[1:15:27] so never let the devil live you under
[1:15:30] see the reason people live under guilt
[1:15:31] as the devil's Twisted in their mind
[1:15:33] that the blood is not enough that yeah
[1:15:35] you should have known better we all
[1:15:36] should have should have known better and
[1:15:39] stages in our walk right David should
[1:15:41] have known better when he took bash
[1:15:42] Sheba yet there he was he was an adopted
[1:15:45] son of God in his position on the
[1:15:48] throne he's a he was a mature
[1:15:51] believer think about about it he wasn't
[1:15:54] just a strapping who just who just got
[1:15:55] saved the other day no he was 50 odd
[1:15:58] years old when that happened he was
[1:16:00] adopted positionally placed in the body
[1:16:01] of Christ right but there was enough
[1:16:05] blood under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:07] for God to forgive him that was just
[1:16:09] under the see so so he came to a place
[1:16:12] where the guilt he no longer carried
[1:16:14] that guilt he no longer carried the
[1:16:17] shame because he realized that God
[1:16:19] allowed all those things because he was
[1:16:21] straying because instead of pressing the
[1:16:24] battle and having grit to go take the
[1:16:26] kingdom he was sitting back in the
[1:16:27] palace just just just you relaxing like
[1:16:30] that and that was actually his his heart
[1:16:33] was wandering from God because he was
[1:16:35] wandering from the prophecy that was
[1:16:37] over his life of becoming King right so
[1:16:39] it's the same thing with you and I it
[1:16:40] can happen that our that our hearts can
[1:16:42] begin to wander from the prophecy of
[1:16:45] that we are the bride of Christ I'll let
[1:16:47] the Holy Spirit blow sound of a rushing
[1:16:50] Mighty Wind
[1:16:52] Hallelujah Hallelujah let the Holy
[1:16:54] Spirit blow Amen Let don't be worried
[1:16:56] about the wind hallelujah amen but you
[1:17:00] see he wasn't see he strayed from it
[1:17:02] that's why he did that but then he says
[1:17:03] I think in Psalms 50 he says you have
[1:17:06] created me a clean heart oh Lord and and
[1:17:08] renew a right Spirit within me that the
[1:17:10] bones that thou broken May
[1:17:12] Rejoice amen so he realized all that
[1:17:15] happened that so so God could bring him
[1:17:17] back to him amen so so so he realized
[1:17:20] there was good in it so he didn't live
[1:17:23] under the shame anymore but the devil
[1:17:25] wants to keep you under shame or under
[1:17:27] guilt don't live under those things our
[1:17:31] His Banner Over Us is love amen that's
[1:17:33] right he doesn't pull the banner away
[1:17:35] from his elect amen there's always a
[1:17:37] banner of love over us no matter what we
[1:17:39] do but we've got to realize what's
[1:17:41] flying over us but the devil wants to
[1:17:43] put a cloud of guilt above us God's
[1:17:46] taking care of the guilt remember it
[1:17:49] says in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our
[1:17:51] iniquities the chastising our people was
[1:17:53] a problem he was bruised for our
[1:17:56] iniquities iniquity is to know right but
[1:17:58] do the
[1:17:59] contrary he's taking care of it all so
[1:18:03] don't let don't let the devil keep you
[1:18:05] under guilt or shame amen
[1:18:08] amen so nowu there is so much light in
[1:18:12] this day and the reason there's so much
[1:18:14] light in this day is that we would be
[1:18:16] like the young man with Elisha as they
[1:18:18] would see there's more for us than there
[1:18:20] are against us amen that all of Heaven
[1:18:22] is a on the earth amen that you know
[1:18:24] it's not just us walking this walk if I
[1:18:26] repeat myself I just I feel to do it
[1:18:28] just now cuz we're going to realize
[1:18:30] we're not here alone amen that God the
[1:18:32] angels of God are here amen God himself
[1:18:35] is here amen we'll physically meet him
[1:18:37] in the air that body is not returned
[1:18:39] right it will one day and we'll meet the
[1:18:41] Lord in the air but his spirit is here
[1:18:43] all that he is is present amen just like
[1:18:46] the Centurion you know came to Jesus and
[1:18:48] said yo Jesus was going to go pray for a
[1:18:51] sick servant but the Centurion said no
[1:18:53] you just speak the word and and and
[1:18:55] he'll be made whole because the
[1:18:56] Centurion realized that the word of
[1:18:58] Jesus was exactly the same as Jesus
[1:19:00] physically going and laying his hands
[1:19:02] upon the servant and so God is his word
[1:19:05] so where his word is he is because you
[1:19:08] can't separate him in the word amen so
[1:19:10] now the word has come open in this day
[1:19:12] amen the seals have come open which
[1:19:14] reveals Christ amen so there's never
[1:19:16] been as much light as there is right now
[1:19:19] and the reason that the light is so
[1:19:21] strong is that we would realize that we
[1:19:23] actually actually there's another
[1:19:25] dimension that's here with us that's far
[1:19:26] more real than the one we see now we
[1:19:28] know that our five senses that we're
[1:19:30] given amen none of these will declare
[1:19:33] God seeing hearing tasting touching
[1:19:37] whatever it is none of those senses that
[1:19:38] we have in this body are given to
[1:19:40] contact God but how much but but we lean
[1:19:44] so much on those five senses for this
[1:19:47] Earthly Journey but it's only faith that
[1:19:48] can touch God Amen and God has given us
[1:19:51] a faith amen that is stronger than what
[1:19:55] we see it is stronger than what we hear
[1:19:57] now it depends what you lean upon if you
[1:20:00] lean upon your five senses you'll get
[1:20:01] the results of your five senses just
[1:20:03] like the young man saying we're doomed
[1:20:06] the armies are all around us we're stuck
[1:20:07] he was leaning on us five senses but
[1:20:09] Elisha wasn't leaning on those five
[1:20:11] senses though he saw the same things
[1:20:13] that the man saw amen but he was leaning
[1:20:15] on faith Hallelujah and that's why he
[1:20:19] said Lord open his eyes Amen to reveal
[1:20:21] what was really there amen so now look
[1:20:24] here friends let me give you this
[1:20:25] illustration I might have done it before
[1:20:27] what color is that shirt it's white
[1:20:29] anyone that's got sight knows that
[1:20:30] shirts white you have five senses of the
[1:20:33] body see taste feel smell here now none
[1:20:35] of those senses will declare God when
[1:20:37] God made man he made him in his image
[1:20:39] the spirit man put him in five senses to
[1:20:41] contact his Earthly home not to contact
[1:20:44] god with those senses don't declare God
[1:20:46] they declare the Earthly home where the
[1:20:47] man had to contact his Earthly home he
[1:20:50] had to see taste feel spell and here but
[1:20:53] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:20:55] for the evidence of things not seen you
[1:20:57] do not see it taste it feel it smell it
[1:20:59] or hear it but you believe it now you
[1:21:01] see what I mean why because that faith
[1:21:02] is greater than the five senses I think
[1:21:05] if we can just surrender to to to that
[1:21:07] faith that six sense of Faith amen it
[1:21:09] doesn't matter what the five senses
[1:21:11] declare that six sense of faith will
[1:21:13] override all who's with me
[1:21:15] today now there's always been a longing
[1:21:18] wherever for for people to see God I'm
[1:21:21] just kind of taking a sway this but just
[1:21:23] just bear with me okay there was always
[1:21:25] a longing for the believer to see God
[1:21:28] even the disciples Philip would say unto
[1:21:30] him Lord show us the father and it
[1:21:33] sufficeth us the Greeks came to Jes um
[1:21:36] came to the disciples said sir we would
[1:21:38] see Jesus because if you can see God
[1:21:41] then you can contact God right if you
[1:21:44] can see God you can now now I'm talking
[1:21:46] about faith now okay so when I say
[1:21:48] seeing I'm not talking about natural
[1:21:49] sight I'm talking about faith that's
[1:21:51] right okay so if you can see him you can
[1:21:54] contact him we can contact him today
[1:21:57] amen okay so yeah right now Jesus said
[1:22:00] unto him have I been so long with you
[1:22:02] and yet thou has not known me Phillip he
[1:22:05] that has seen me has seen the father and
[1:22:07] how say thou show us the father why
[1:22:10] because Jesus is saying have I been so
[1:22:12] long with you I've been right with you
[1:22:14] but it was the veil of his Humanity that
[1:22:16] that that philli couldn't quite see past
[1:22:18] and then believeth thou not that I in
[1:22:20] the Father the father in me the words
[1:22:22] that I speak unto you there um I I speak
[1:22:25] not of myself but the father that
[1:22:27] dwelleth in me he doeth the works so
[1:22:29] he's saying the father that's dwelling
[1:22:31] in me is doing what you see so Jesus
[1:22:33] would go to lazarus's grave and he'd say
[1:22:35] Lazarus come forth that was the father
[1:22:37] doing that was God doing it we know
[1:22:38] Jesus was the god man right but you see
[1:22:42] you see it was it was the father doing
[1:22:43] the works of raising Lazarus amen it was
[1:22:46] the father cing the Sea of Galilee it
[1:22:48] was the father feeding the 5,000 all
[1:22:50] those things it was God manifest tested
[1:22:53] amen and he says now if you can't see if
[1:22:56] you can't really see me see the father
[1:22:59] see what he does and then you can see
[1:23:01] it's really God I mean believe me that
[1:23:04] I'm in the Father the father of me or
[1:23:05] else believe me for the very work sake
[1:23:08] so he's saying now you see the
[1:23:10] manifestation of God you're seeing
[1:23:13] God right you see the manifestation you
[1:23:16] see him amen this is very important
[1:23:19] because if we see God moving we say
[1:23:20] there's God Amen cuz we know we say oh
[1:23:24] Jes when we say Jesus is here we're not
[1:23:26] saying there's a physical man of us so
[1:23:28] so much height with a beard and you know
[1:23:30] Palestinian garment walking around no
[1:23:32] his spirit is here right doing the works
[1:23:35] that he did back there amen because he's
[1:23:38] alive today amen and so when we see his
[1:23:40] Holy Spirit Come Among Us and do the
[1:23:43] works amen we can say that Jesus is here
[1:23:45] and we're seeing God manifested now you
[1:23:48] can see that not just in you know
[1:23:50] preaching or singing of things but in
[1:23:52] person's life you should I trust we can
[1:23:54] look beyond the natural Veil and we can
[1:23:57] see the father because God is in flesh
[1:24:00] today Amen in in in you and I now this
[1:24:03] is very important because if we can see
[1:24:05] God then it gives us a grit that we can
[1:24:08] possess the promise amen because God is
[1:24:10] here we can contact God by faith amen
[1:24:12] and God can give us what we have need of
[1:24:14] who's with me today amen and then so
[1:24:16] Jesus now says if you basically see the
[1:24:18] father then if you believe amen that the
[1:24:22] works that see he that believeth on me
[1:24:23] the works that I do shall he do also so
[1:24:26] now if you see a manifest it and you
[1:24:28] believe the same thing can happen out of
[1:24:30] your life and this is why Jesus had the
[1:24:32] disciples for three and a half years and
[1:24:34] he manifested him his glory to them that
[1:24:37] now when the Holy Ghost came into them
[1:24:39] they realized that what he did we'll do
[1:24:41] also because he's in us now right so so
[1:24:44] God see Jesus opened the Unseen realm to
[1:24:47] the disciples and now the message in the
[1:24:50] end time what does it do it opens heaven
[1:24:52] to you and I that we can realize what
[1:24:55] was in what was in the ministry of
[1:24:57] brother brandom that same God is in the
[1:24:59] bride of Christ amen that's why it says
[1:25:01] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:25:03] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:25:05] than these shall he do because I go unto
[1:25:07] my father that's why we can look at the
[1:25:09] ministry of brother brandham and we can
[1:25:11] rejoice in the Supernatural but we
[1:25:13] Rejoice not just in a historical fact
[1:25:15] amen but we Rejoice now that that same
[1:25:17] God is Among Us amen that's why we can
[1:25:20] Rejoice you read the book of Acts and
[1:25:21] the Holy Ghost filling people we rejoice
[1:25:23] in that not just because it's a
[1:25:25] historical fact but because he does the
[1:25:27] same thing today am mean that we can see
[1:25:29] the pillar of fire come down Among Us
[1:25:30] and do the supernatural works of God
[1:25:33] Amen so why because we've seen God in
[1:25:36] this day manifested in a prophet and
[1:25:39] we've seen God in this day manifested in
[1:25:41] the bride of Christ hallelujah amen if
[1:25:45] you can see see this see to me this
[1:25:47] should give us such grit if we realize
[1:25:49] God's Not Just In Heaven somewhere
[1:25:52] brother said Dey is not just in heaven
[1:25:53] it's in you am me that the god that
[1:25:56] we're contacting by faith is not
[1:25:58] somewhere in another dimension only but
[1:26:01] he's present upon the Earth he's not a
[1:26:03] million miles away but he's here right
[1:26:05] now to meet every
[1:26:07] need
[1:26:09] Hallelujah now if you look through the
[1:26:11] scriptures look through the gospels you
[1:26:13] see there are there are people that have
[1:26:15] a real grit they have a real
[1:26:17] perseverance and and I'm just going to
[1:26:20] maybe wind up with this thought we'll
[1:26:21] see how we go but Jesus would Jesus
[1:26:24] would speak well uh you know Mark would
[1:26:27] give the account and you know it's in a
[1:26:28] few a few different um gospels of this
[1:26:32] sarapan woman I mean she was a Greek a
[1:26:35] serap phenician Woman by nation and so
[1:26:39] she saw that g or she heard that this
[1:26:42] Man From Galilee was more than a prophet
[1:26:45] he was more than a religious leader but
[1:26:49] he was God yeah she this was revealed to
[1:26:52] her her now because it was revealed it
[1:26:54] gave her a grit to get what she needed
[1:26:57] right it gave her perseverance that she
[1:27:00] could persevere through many different
[1:27:02] obstacles to get what she needed she see
[1:27:05] Christian grit gives you the
[1:27:07] perseverance to not rest until you get
[1:27:09] what you need right Christian grit does
[1:27:12] not quit halfway amen it doesn't quit
[1:27:15] halfway it doesn't matter what the
[1:27:16] trouble is you may get discouraged but
[1:27:18] there's something greater in you than
[1:27:19] your discouragement right you may see
[1:27:22] things in the negative but there's
[1:27:23] something in you that's greater than the
[1:27:24] negative amen there's a faith that pulls
[1:27:27] you to him amen that something in you if
[1:27:29] we just let Faith control Our Lives if
[1:27:32] we really just let go and let God be God
[1:27:35] I think his brother impul said a few
[1:27:36] months ago we're going to let God be God
[1:27:39] I mean we can't let him just be an Aron
[1:27:40] boy or a mascot or or or even just an
[1:27:42] object of worship we're going to let him
[1:27:44] be Supreme let him take control
[1:27:47] completely amen if we can just let God
[1:27:49] be God today am mean God can do what God
[1:27:51] does does amen hallelujah I believe it
[1:27:54] amen so now now here she was she was she
[1:27:56] was
[1:27:58] perseverant because she besought him
[1:28:00] that because there was a devil in her
[1:28:02] daughter now notice she did not take her
[1:28:05] daughter to Jesus she went to Jesus for
[1:28:07] her daughter amen because she believed
[1:28:10] that if if he just spoke the word that
[1:28:12] demon had to go irrespective of where
[1:28:14] she was that demon had to go amen so so
[1:28:17] she she had a real grit in her that a
[1:28:20] lot of the Jewish people didn't have
[1:28:23] amen God God put it in her amen now she
[1:28:26] had a lot of she had a lot of obstacles
[1:28:29] but her faith did not have any obstacles
[1:28:31] amen because she went to Jesus she
[1:28:33] called out son of David have mercy amen
[1:28:36] but then but then David I mean I mean um
[1:28:37] Jesus ignored her the disciples said you
[1:28:39] know send her away different things and
[1:28:42] then and then she got into the presence
[1:28:43] of Jesus now many times we think we just
[1:28:45] get into his presence then it's all over
[1:28:47] that's where the battle really begins
[1:28:49] because here she comes no doubt she
[1:28:52] thinking oh finally I'm here don't know
[1:28:54] how far she had to travel I don't know
[1:28:57] you know what things she had to do to
[1:28:58] get there but she got there but then now
[1:29:01] he looks her in the eyes and said you
[1:29:03] know it's not meat to give the
[1:29:04] children's bread to cast it to
[1:29:06] dogs now if she didn't have that grit
[1:29:10] she would have got offended how dare he
[1:29:13] I believe he's Messiah I believe he can
[1:29:16] heal my daughter and look what he calls
[1:29:18] me calls me a dog but see grit Christian
[1:29:22] grit goes beyond and also those things
[1:29:25] happen to prove what's in you because
[1:29:28] her faith was greater than any obstacle
[1:29:31] that could be thrown in front of her see
[1:29:34] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:29:35] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail the
[1:29:38] revelation of who Jesus Christ is she
[1:29:39] had the Revelation this man's Messiah
[1:29:42] he's more than a Prophet this is God in
[1:29:43] flesh so nothing could stop her getting
[1:29:46] to him to get what she needed amen so so
[1:29:50] there she goes but you see she came in
[1:29:53] humility amen she came in reverence and
[1:29:55] humility she didn't come proud see a lot
[1:29:58] of people they think oh I've I know who
[1:30:01] I
[1:30:02] am I can tell you all the quotes all the
[1:30:04] scriptures I can go from Genesis to
[1:30:06] revelation God owes me something you
[1:30:09] don't get nothing from God like that
[1:30:11] I've got all the pins the belt buckles
[1:30:12] and the hat and I got all the
[1:30:14] paraphernalia I've Been Everywhere seen
[1:30:15] all the things no we you don't get goded
[1:30:18] anything like that it takes a reverent
[1:30:21] humility yes right Amen to get what we
[1:30:24] need so she came said yay Lord but even
[1:30:27] even the even the dogs get the crumbs
[1:30:29] from from underneath the master's table
[1:30:32] she was just looking for a crumb and
[1:30:34] that crumb was enough amen that crumb
[1:30:37] was enough to set her daughter free amen
[1:30:40] if we just go crumb
[1:30:42] searching Hallelujah if we just go crumb
[1:30:44] searching in the Bible you can look for
[1:30:46] a small promise that promise is more
[1:30:48] than enough to meet whatever need you
[1:30:49] have amen but you if we come and
[1:30:51] humility sure Lord I may not deserve a
[1:30:53] slice but I'm just here for anything am
[1:30:56] mean I'm here for just the smallest
[1:30:57] Speck I know that smallest Speck of a
[1:30:59] blessing is enough to to to meet my need
[1:31:02] amen and and see she said yes Lord and
[1:31:06] that Lord means Supreme in Authority
[1:31:08] amen see she knew who he was amen this a
[1:31:12] that she realized that he's Supreme and
[1:31:14] supreme and Authority that he is as an n
[1:31:17] a controller by implication he is God
[1:31:20] he's Lord he's master amen so she went
[1:31:23] to him realizing you're the Supreme one
[1:31:25] Lord you can do whatever you can meet my
[1:31:28] need amen you're more than able see
[1:31:30] because she knew who he was it gave her
[1:31:33] a grit and a perseverance to get what
[1:31:36] she needed amen this is why we are a
[1:31:39] people of vision this morning because we
[1:31:41] know he's all powerful he's allmighty
[1:31:44] he's omnipotent amen he can do anything
[1:31:46] amen he is the he is the master amen he
[1:31:49] is he is the sup he's Supreme Authority
[1:31:52] he speaks a word every Devil's got to
[1:31:54] shut up he speaks one word every demon
[1:31:57] has has to move back to their place amen
[1:32:00] and you got to realize that voice is in
[1:32:01] you amen that's right amen the voice of
[1:32:04] God is in the bride of Christ amen but
[1:32:06] you see he's a supreme one now see she
[1:32:10] she confessed this and she got what she
[1:32:12] needed now it's very interesting that
[1:32:13] before this before this um account Jesus
[1:32:17] begins to speak about what really
[1:32:18] defiles a
[1:32:19] man that's amaz see uh see many times
[1:32:22] you read the gospels it's interesting
[1:32:23] how things are ordered they're ordered
[1:32:24] for a certain way because now here's
[1:32:27] Jesus speaking before this account we
[1:32:28] just read about it says now that which
[1:32:31] defiles a man is out the the things from
[1:32:34] within the heart evil thoughts
[1:32:37] adulteries fornications murders THS
[1:32:39] covetousness wickedness deceit
[1:32:41] lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy
[1:32:43] Pride foolishness all these evil things
[1:32:45] come from within and defile the man now
[1:32:48] here now here comes a woman that's going
[1:32:50] to show really
[1:32:52] what see see cuz it's there's two things
[1:32:55] things that come out of you can either
[1:32:56] defile you or it can redeem you whatever
[1:33:00] comes out right Jesus is giving the
[1:33:03] negative this is what comes out of a man
[1:33:05] that defiles them but now here comes a
[1:33:07] woman in humility and reverence and
[1:33:09] respect amen and it wasn't Pride didn't
[1:33:12] come out of her heart when she responded
[1:33:14] to the word amen evil thoughts you know
[1:33:17] blasphemy foolishness none of those
[1:33:19] things came out of her deceit none of
[1:33:21] those things came out of her when she
[1:33:23] was talking to the Lord but it was out
[1:33:25] of her pure heart she came before him
[1:33:27] amen I trust you're following me amen
[1:33:29] see see see see God tests what's within
[1:33:32] us amen and I trust that when we we have
[1:33:37] grit that there's nothing negative in us
[1:33:40] see if we got a real Christian grp we
[1:33:41] going say Lord cleanse Me of anything
[1:33:43] that's not of you anything that's
[1:33:45] contrary to your word Lord take it out
[1:33:47] of me that's real Christian grit I mean
[1:33:50] when when we can we can can lay
[1:33:51] ourselves upon his altar of his word and
[1:33:54] let him take anything out of our Lives
[1:33:55] that's contrary to his word I mean you
[1:33:57] see so when she came to him she was in
[1:34:00] that kind of condition cuz God revealed
[1:34:02] to her who he was amen so when she
[1:34:05] approached him it wasn't arrogantly it
[1:34:07] wasn't in Pride she didn't get offended
[1:34:10] and and and the Lord would even say in
[1:34:11] one place great is thy
[1:34:14] faith
[1:34:15] amen great is I Faith this another
[1:34:18] account am mean and she was made whole
[1:34:20] you see faith is a source that others
[1:34:24] don't
[1:34:25] see see we got grit today I'm just going
[1:34:28] to wind down with these Source faith is
[1:34:31] stronger than anything Faith created the
[1:34:34] worlds because God believed his own word
[1:34:36] when he said let there be sun moon and
[1:34:37] stars right Faith moves mountains Faith
[1:34:41] raises the dead that's Revelation faith
[1:34:43] when it's revealed to you right amen
[1:34:45] Faith part of the Red Sea Faith brought
[1:34:48] fire down from heaven on Mount Carmel
[1:34:50] amen faith Faith took Elijah in a
[1:34:52] Rapture amen Faith raised the dead
[1:34:55] raised Lazarus out of the Grave
[1:34:57] conquered HDE in the grave that was
[1:34:58] Revelation Faith because Jesus had a
[1:35:00] revelation of who he was right so it's a
[1:35:02] source that others don't see see it's
[1:35:05] see it's those hidden things you know I
[1:35:07] was told was brother Ron Spencer
[1:35:09] accounted it a few years ago that you
[1:35:10] know there's a great horse race in in
[1:35:12] America called the Kentucky Derby and
[1:35:15] many Rich horse owners will spend
[1:35:17] millions and millions of dollars to try
[1:35:19] and find a horse that will win win the
[1:35:21] race
[1:35:22] and and one year there was a horse that
[1:35:23] didn't look like a
[1:35:25] winner you know but but but when it was
[1:35:27] bought there was something about this
[1:35:29] horse it wasn't the right height didn't
[1:35:31] see the right dimensions or the right
[1:35:32] muscle strength or whatever at a certain
[1:35:34] age but the buyer looked could somehow
[1:35:37] look beyond the physical stature and
[1:35:39] said this horse is a winner and then
[1:35:41] there were other horses who looked like
[1:35:43] winners but didn't win but the one who
[1:35:44] didn't look like the winner won that
[1:35:47] race and it wasn't even sold for that
[1:35:49] very much apparently but it won a multi
[1:35:51] million dollar race why cuz it had a
[1:35:53] real grit on the inside I mean it had
[1:35:55] something on the inside that others
[1:35:57] couldn't see it had a source that was
[1:35:59] Far Beyond just a natural ability amen
[1:36:02] and that's what faith is it's a source
[1:36:03] that's far beyond natural ability amen
[1:36:06] that we can that we can look beyond what
[1:36:08] we see and go possess every promise I'm
[1:36:10] just going to wind up with these things
[1:36:12] but look this but this little woman that
[1:36:14] we read about she was a Greek but she
[1:36:16] had heard of Jesus and Faith cometh by
[1:36:18] what hearing hearing the word of God now
[1:36:20] she was a Greek of another Nation but
[1:36:22] you know though she wasn't in the belief
[1:36:24] of that she was of A different race of
[1:36:26] people yet you know Faith finds a source
[1:36:28] that others don't
[1:36:30] see some people say I can't see what
[1:36:33] you're seeing but you see it right Faith
[1:36:36] finds a source that others doesn't see
[1:36:38] and her faith had found that Source now
[1:36:41] she knew that by hearing if she'd have
[1:36:43] got there that it was going to happen
[1:36:46] amen the word of God according to
[1:36:47] Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th
[1:36:48] verse is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:36:51] we we know that faith is what holds that
[1:36:53] sword there's nothing else can hold the
[1:36:54] sword of the Bible but faith in God that
[1:36:56] yields it now we find now you might be
[1:36:59] weak with your arm of Faith but maybe
[1:37:00] you can just cut out justification maybe
[1:37:03] you can just cut out enough to join the
[1:37:04] church but a good strong arm of faith
[1:37:06] can cut through to the baptism of the
[1:37:08] Holy Ghost it can cut through to Divine
[1:37:10] Healing it can cut through to gifts
[1:37:12] miracles signs wonders it can cut every
[1:37:14] promise of God out of the skies and
[1:37:16] claim it because it's yielding the word
[1:37:18] of God you know it's like if you who's
[1:37:20] ever seen like in the um what used to be
[1:37:22] called thep show I don't know what the
[1:37:23] country shows are called these days but
[1:37:25] you know you see the ax chopping
[1:37:27] competitions who's ever seen that you
[1:37:29] know and some guys is like one blow and
[1:37:31] the whole thing's in half and you know
[1:37:33] but those who start in the competition
[1:37:36] they might not be able to go as fast as
[1:37:38] the winner they might not be able to be
[1:37:39] as strong as the winner but they're
[1:37:41] determined to make those cuts right they
[1:37:44] may have to land more blows but they get
[1:37:46] the job done so you may think well I'm
[1:37:48] not very strong in faith I can't hold
[1:37:50] the word in such a strong arm of Faith
[1:37:52] like someone else I say just keep
[1:37:54] cutting C amen just keep cutting your
[1:37:56] cut may only take up a little chunk but
[1:37:58] just just keep cutting until that
[1:38:01] promise is reality am mean keep holding
[1:38:03] that promise before God am mean keep
[1:38:05] focusing on that promise that's how you
[1:38:07] cut amen if you realize peace is mine
[1:38:11] then then then look into the word where
[1:38:13] it says that his peace he that he gives
[1:38:15] unto you focus on that promise this this
[1:38:17] is how you start cutting start
[1:38:19] meditating upon that promise and start
[1:38:21] thinking now God has given it to me by
[1:38:24] the blood of Jesus Christ amen and then
[1:38:26] what will happen that promise will
[1:38:28] become a revelation will become a
[1:38:30] reality to you amen so you may be strong
[1:38:33] but keep cutting don't quit it could
[1:38:35] just be one more blow it could be one
[1:38:37] more prayer it could be one more amen it
[1:38:40] could be one more praise the Lord it
[1:38:41] could be one more quote you don't know
[1:38:43] and the thing will be gone and it'll
[1:38:44] become reality amen so don't quit amen
[1:38:47] we've got a grit we can't
[1:38:49] quit amen hallelujah hallelujah amen she
[1:38:53] had many hindrances but uh if you'd
[1:38:55] happened to go to think about it but her
[1:38:56] faith didn't have any that's it if your
[1:38:58] faith don't have any hindrances it's
[1:39:00] different she had but her faith had
[1:39:02] hindrances I mean but her faith had no
[1:39:04] hindrances sorry Faith doesn't know no
[1:39:06] hindrance Faith only knows one thing
[1:39:08] it's goal that's
[1:39:10] all so let's let our faith focus on the
[1:39:13] goal what's our goal Rapture amen what's
[1:39:18] the part of that goal our family
