[Music] I come as I am. I believe this alabaster you receive broken face sin erased. Oh, so I can praise the one who gave me freom. Oh, I will praise I will praise the name above all names. Worthy is the lamb who was slain. And I will praise. I will praise the name above all names. Worthy is the lamb who rose again. You are the one who made a billion years in a moment. By your word you made light. So we can praise the maker of time in this moment. I will praise I will praise the name above all names. He is the lamb who rose and I will praise I will praise the name above all names. Worthy is the lamb who rose again. Worthy is the lamb who rose again. I'll praise you on the stormy seas. I'll praise you in the night. I'll praise you on the mountain tops. I'll praise you in the fight. I'll praise you on the stormy seas. I'll praise you in the night. I'll praise you on the mountain tops. I'll praise you in the fire. I will praise I will praise the name above all names where is the lamb who was slain. I will praise I will praise the name above all names. Blessed is the lamb who rose again. Oh, I'll praise you on the stormy seas. I'll praise you in the night. I'll praise you on the mountain tops. I'll praise you in the fire. Nothing can stop me praising. Nothing can separate me. Nothing can stop me praising. Nothing can stop me praising you. I will praise. I will praise the name above all names. Worthy is the lamb who was slain. And I will praise. I will praise the name above all names. Worthy is the lamb who rose again. Course again. And I will praise. I will praise the name above my name. Worthy is the lamb who was slain. And I will praise. I will praise the name above my name. Worthy is the lamb who rose again. [Music] Worthy is the lamb who rose again. Oh, worthy is the lamb who rose again. Amen. [Applause]
