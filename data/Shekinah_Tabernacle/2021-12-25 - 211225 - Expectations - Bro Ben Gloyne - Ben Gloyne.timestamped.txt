[4:25] &gt;&gt; Morning.
[4:42] [music]
[4:48] [music]
[4:53] [music]
[4:54] How are you all this morning? You happy
[4:58] the happiest you've ever been in your
[5:00] whole life?
[5:04] It's good to be um
[5:06] it's good to be in a place where we feel
[5:08] at home where we can experience the
[5:10] spirit of God because as sons and
[5:11] daughters of God, there's a song that I
[5:13] believe it says, "This world is not my
[5:15] home. I'm just passing through." So,
[5:18] we're I don't know if you've noticed in
[5:20] your life, but you know, we [music] like
[5:23] a cold a dark atmosphere we're not
[5:25] really familiar with. It doesn't we
[5:26] don't really feel at home. [music] And
[5:28] this world is full of that. It's full of
[5:29] you know, can be full of negative or
[5:31] dark atmospheres. But when we get in the
[5:32] atmosphere of the spirit of [music] God,
[5:34] then we feel at home. It's like this is
[5:36] me. This is where I belong. This is this
[5:38] is me. This is this is where I'm
[5:40] comfortable. And that's what we want
[5:42] this morning is we [music] want the
[5:43] spirit of God to come in our midst and
[5:45] and just
[5:47] move in a supernatural way and create
[5:48] the atmosphere where we we feel at home,
[5:50] you know, where we can just relax and we
[5:51] can we can be also in an atmosphere of
[5:54] faith, not in an atmosphere of, you
[5:56] know, we and we we think about things
[5:59] during the week and all these other
[6:00] things, but you know, we want to get in
[6:01] an atmosphere of faith. Faith where like
[6:04] when brother Ben speaks, we're not it's
[6:06] not just, oh, we're naturally looking at
[6:08] a guy and he's going up here and talking
[6:09] about a few things. We we've got a whole
[6:11] different perspective. we we're we're
[6:13] approaching by faith and we're [music]
[6:14] we're receiving from the spirit of God
[6:16] and the spirit of God's moving and
[6:18] speaking through him and the word of
[6:19] God's going forth and it's going into
[6:20] our heart and changing us and
[6:22] everything. It's just there's a it's a
[6:23] whole different realm that we're that we
[6:24] enter into. So [music] that's that's the
[6:26] that's what we're that's what we're
[6:28] approaching this morning. So let's um
[6:29] stand and let's just commit the service
[6:31] to the Lord.
[6:33] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful that
[6:34] we can, Lord, have this grand [music]
[6:36] opportunity that we can enter into your
[6:38] presence this morning, Lord. And we just
[6:39] want to invite you here, Lord, and we
[6:41] understand that all the effort that you
[6:43] made through this whole what we call the
[6:46] gospel [music] and the the as your word
[6:47] going forth and everything was just so
[6:49] that we can come and fellowship with
[6:51] you. So, we just want to come this
[6:52] [music] morning. We know that you you
[6:54] always desire to meet with us. And we we
[6:56] desire so much and you would just dwell
[6:58] with us um this morning, Lord, that you
[7:00] said we're two or three gathered in your
[7:01] name. There you are in the midst. So we
[7:03] thank you so much that you're here by
[7:04] your spirit, Lord. And we just pray
[7:05] you'd bless the service in a powerful
[7:06] way. May you just anoint the songs,
[7:08] anoint the preaching, anoint each heart,
[7:10] Lord. Help us to we just want to set
[7:12] aside anything that would distract us
[7:13] and just be just come in an atmosphere
[7:15] of faith and just
[7:31] Okay.

[30:58] [music and singing] you say.
[31:02] Every painted [singing] sky, your canvas
[31:06] of [music] your grace.

[32:12] And if the song of all our praises
[32:15] [singing] still fall shine,

[32:56] the light of the world abandoned in
[32:59] darkness [music] to die.
[33:05] [music]
[33:07] And as you speak,
[33:12] a 100 million failures disappear.
[33:19] Where you lost your life so I could find
[33:23] it here.
[33:27] If you left the grave behind, you're

[35:55] you brought heaven
[35:58] down. [music]

[39:26] her way. So, my other sister's on her
[39:27] way. and praise the Lord. Have a good
[39:29] old family time. It's really good. Amen.
[39:31] So, God bless you all. Amen. Great to
[39:32] have everyone here. Amen. Just a
[39:35] reminder, there's no uh service this
[39:36] Wednesday, so Christmas Eve. So, but
[39:39] we'll be back on Sunday. Um let's go to
[39:42] um Wait, I got to go here, don't I?
[39:45] Yeah, that's working. Okay, brilliant.
[39:46] Let's take Yes, we're going to go in the
[39:47] scripture. Amen to um we're going to go
[39:50] to Luke chapter 2
[39:53] and we're going to read verses 25-30.
[40:00] Amen.
[40:02] All right. So, Luke
[40:06] uh Luke 2:25-30. We got it here. Yep. It
[40:08] says here, "And behold, there was a man
[40:10] in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And
[40:13] the same man was just and devout,
[40:14] waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[40:16] And the Holy Spirit was upon him, and it
[40:18] was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost,
[40:20] that he should not see death before he
[40:23] had seen the Lord's Christ." And he came
[40:25] by the spirit into the temple. And when
[40:27] the parents brought in the child Jesus
[40:29] to do for him after the custom of the
[40:31] law, then he took him up in his arms and
[40:33] blessed God and said,"Lord, now let us
[40:35] thou uh thy servant depart in peace
[40:38] according to thy word for th for mine
[40:40] eyes have seen thy salvation." Praise
[40:44] the Lord. Amen. So let's um let's bow
[40:45] our heads in word of prayer. If you want
[40:47] to be remembered in prayer, say, "Lord,
[40:48] come by my way today." Amen. Gracious
[40:51] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord. we
[40:53] can have this grand opportunity to lift
[40:55] up your great name to praise you give
[40:57] you glory give you thanks cuz you are
[40:59] the mighty God Lord we thank you father
[41:01] for your great mercy Lord this day I
[41:03] just pray as we've read your word may
[41:05] anchor it into our hearts may it bring
[41:06] forth hundfold and may you speak to all
[41:08] of our lives Lord meet all of our needs
[41:10] both here Lord and those who are
[41:12] streaming we commit our lives into your
[41:14] hands cover us in your blood Lord
[41:15] forgive us for our sins and our wrongs
[41:17] in Jesus Christ's name we ask these
[41:19] things amend bless you can all have your
[41:22] seats
[41:23] uh this morning. So I want to um speak
[41:27] on I want to speak on expectations.
[41:30] Amen. I just love I just love these kind
[41:32] of pictures, you know, here here, you
[41:34] know, you you get what you expect, okay?
[41:37] Like brother Bram tells a story there
[41:40] there was a lady one night, you know,
[41:41] there's a big mountain by her house and
[41:43] she and she prayed one night and said,
[41:44] "Lord, remove the mountain." You know,
[41:47] and she gets up the next day, opens the
[41:48] blind, sees the mountain, says, "Well, I
[41:50] expected that." you know, just there and
[41:52] well, she got what she expected.
[41:54] Basically, she didn't actually expect
[41:55] the mountain to move, you see. But you
[41:57] see, but we get what we expect. And I'm
[41:59] so thankful the Lord's put a faith in
[42:01] our hearts to expect the as as he says,
[42:05] maybe I think it's my last scripture,
[42:06] but we but I never stay, you know. But
[42:09] he's able to do exceedingly abundantly
[42:11] above all that we could ask or think
[42:14] according to the power that workketh
[42:16] workketh in us. this um sorry this
[42:18] monitor's
[42:20] okay that's fine well I can just yeah
[42:22] okay sweeter so you know he can we can
[42:25] do he can do above abundantly
[42:28] exceedingly abundantly more than we can
[42:30] ask or think so that's not just a little
[42:32] bit more see my experience with the Lord
[42:33] I'm sure it's yours is he doesn't just
[42:35] meet your expectation he just blows it
[42:37] out of the water he takes it he takes it
[42:39] to the stratosphere he goes far beyond
[42:41] and you know but you know but the Lord
[42:43] has given us faith that we can have an
[42:46] expectation
[42:47] Because in this Christmas season, we
[42:49] understand that, you know, it's a great
[42:51] tradition to gather and, you know, we're
[42:53] looking, you know, people, well, it's
[42:54] really Santa Claus has taken over the
[42:56] whole thing. But, you know, for the
[42:58] believer, Amen. We can have this holiday
[43:00] season to thank the Lord that he he was
[43:03] born. Amen. That the word became flesh
[43:06] to redeem us. Amen. And we can just
[43:08] rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord, for
[43:10] the gift of eternal life." Amen. That we
[43:13] didn't have to earn. We didn't have to
[43:15] buy it. Salvation is without money or
[43:17] price. Amen. But our Lord is so merciful
[43:19] and great. Amen. Because he knew that
[43:21] none of us could earn it. None of us
[43:23] could buy it. What could we ever give of
[43:26] ourselves that could merit eternal life?
[43:28] So, he knew that we couldn't do it. So,
[43:29] he says, "I'm just going to give it to
[43:30] you." Amen. So, there's such power in in
[43:33] this gift that God's given us. Now, an
[43:36] expectation, Webster tells us, is an act
[43:38] or state of expecting. It's an
[43:40] anticipation. It's something expected
[43:43] and it's a basis for expecting. It's an
[43:45] assurance. And when God begins to move,
[43:48] amen, when you know, you know, I'm sure
[43:49] we can all think back in our lives where
[43:51] God was just a story, but then he became
[43:54] a reality. Amen. He became a living God.
[43:56] And you begin to see him fulfill his
[43:58] word in your life. And the spirit of God
[44:00] moves. He pours out his power and
[44:02] demonstrates his great ability. And what
[44:04] does it do? That increases your
[44:05] expectation because it, you know, to
[44:08] begin with, it's a can he do it? You
[44:09] know, we read he can and I believe he
[44:11] can, but then he does. And it just
[44:13] throws us into such a great expectation
[44:15] because we've seen him do, you know,
[44:17] we've seen him do great things and it
[44:19] and and and it increases our expectation
[44:22] for him to do more. I'm going to be
[44:24] using that word expectation a lot today.
[44:26] Okay? So, but I trust we're all living
[44:28] under a great expectation that God in
[44:31] this day is fulfilling his word and he's
[44:32] fulfilling it in our lives. Amen. Not
[44:35] just somewhere, you know, I'm so glad
[44:36] our God did not die when the prophet
[44:38] died, but that same mighty angel, the
[44:40] Lord Jesus Christ, is present in 2025,
[44:43] and he'll be with us in 2026. Amen. And
[44:46] he will continue to prove his word.
[44:48] He'll continue to manifest his power.
[44:51] Amen. And I believe this puts us under
[44:53] great expectation. Now, you take for
[44:55] example Simeon there in the temple. The
[44:58] Lord told him he wasn't going to die
[45:00] until he saw the Lord's Christ. Now, for
[45:03] everyone else, you know, probably
[45:05] onlookers would say he's just a crazy
[45:07] old man and he's lost his marbles, but
[45:09] actually he found his marbles. Because
[45:11] when the Lord reveals to you his word,
[45:14] it gives you vision. It gives you
[45:15] purpose. It gives you the right thinking
[45:17] in any situation that you can walk
[45:19] through whatever you're going through
[45:21] with clarity because why? You're now
[45:23] under expectation that what the Lord has
[45:25] promised you in that moment is going to
[45:26] be fulfilled. Amen. So others would say,
[45:29] "Simeon, you're crazy. You think you're
[45:30] going to see the Messiah." We've been
[45:32] waiting thousands of years for the
[45:33] Messiah Simeon. It's been 400 years
[45:35] since Malachi. You know, you know,
[45:37] there's nothing been going on. And you
[45:38] think of all people, you're going to see
[45:40] it. But you see, to him, he knew it was
[45:43] going to happen because it was an
[45:44] expectation by the Holy Ghost. And
[45:47] anything God uh quickens you by his
[45:50] word. You can have assurance that God
[45:52] will fulfill that expectation. Amen.
[45:54] It's not some empty hope so. It's a no
[45:57] because it's according to his word. And
[45:58] I'm so thankful that we can walk through
[46:01] life under great expectation because
[46:03] when God gives us a promise, we know
[46:04] he's more than able to fulfill it. Amen.
[46:07] So everyone thought he was crazy, but he
[46:08] knew he wasn't crazy. Amen. And then in
[46:11] the right season, Amen. when Mary and
[46:12] Joseph came into the temple, Amen. Then
[46:14] what you know, Simeon's there in the
[46:16] temple and the Holy Spirit speaks to him
[46:17] and says, "Get up, Simeon. What I
[46:20] promised you is now going to be
[46:21] fulfilled." Amen. the expectation I've
[46:24] given you, I'm not going to leave it
[46:25] just as an expectation, but it's going
[46:27] to be a fulfilled expectation. Amen. So,
[46:29] the Holy Spirit led him through all
[46:31] those line of women dedicating their
[46:32] babies right to where Jesus Christ was,
[46:35] and he lifted him up and said, "Now I
[46:37] can depart in peace, for mine eyes have
[46:39] seen thy salvation." Praise the Lord.
[46:42] And I'm sure we can all rejoice knowing.
[46:44] Amen. Because God placed that
[46:46] expectation in Simeon's life because God
[46:48] was going to fulfill it in his life. Now
[46:53] God has expectation that his word is
[46:55] going to be fulfilled. God has supreme
[46:57] confidence that his word is going to be
[46:59] fulfilled. Like for example when he
[47:01] spoke in the beginning let there be
[47:03] light. He wasn't guessing is light going
[47:05] to form or how's it going to you know
[47:07] manifest itself. He knew exactly how
[47:10] that light what light was going to be.
[47:12] He knew exactly what it was going to do
[47:14] because he when he spoke he believed his
[47:16] own word and it came to pass. And as the
[47:18] Lord was saying in Isaiah 55, he says,
[47:20] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[47:22] neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[47:24] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[47:26] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[47:28] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[47:30] your thoughts. For as the rain cometh
[47:31] down in the snow from heaven, and
[47:33] returneth not hither, but waterth the
[47:35] earth, and maketh it bring forth in bud,
[47:37] that it may give seed to the sewer, and
[47:39] bread to the eater, so shall my word
[47:41] that uh be that goeth forth out of my
[47:43] mouth. It shall not return unto me
[47:44] void." Amen. But it shall accomplish
[47:47] that which I please and it shall prosper
[47:49] in the thing where two I sent it. Amen.
[47:51] So God is under expectation. His word
[47:53] that he sent forth, he knows and
[47:56] believes and is sure it's going to
[47:57] fulfill what it's going to fulfill.
[47:59] Amen. So when he said, "Let there be
[48:01] botney life." He got botney life. He was
[48:03] under expectation. What I've spoken will
[48:05] be. Amen. And when he said, "I'm going
[48:07] to have a bride without spot or wrinkle
[48:08] wash in my blood." Amen. Nothing, no
[48:11] order against her, no sin held against
[48:13] her whatsoever. When he spoke that,
[48:15] Amen. And when he spoke through you know
[48:16] to John you know the lamb's wife has
[48:19] made herself ready for granted unto her
[48:21] she be arrayed and fine linen clean and
[48:23] white which is righteous of saints. He
[48:25] wasn't wondering is it going to be h you
[48:27] know is it going to happen he was under
[48:29] expectation having a revelation knowing
[48:31] it was going to be fulfilled. Amen. And
[48:33] when God gives you a revelation of his
[48:35] word you can have expectation that it
[48:38] will happen exactly as he said. Amen.
[48:40] And he says here that it not not just
[48:43] going to go forth and accomplish, but
[48:44] it's going to prosper. It's going to
[48:46] flourish. Amen. And I believe the Lord
[48:48] has caused us to flourish spiritually.
[48:51] Amen. We're not a porper on the street
[48:53] just begging bread, you know, a few
[48:55] scraps from the master's table, but God
[48:56] has given us a big banquet. Amen. Of
[48:59] spiritual food. Amen. He's called us to
[49:01] the wedding, you know, you know, to his
[49:02] dining table like Mphibicheth was all
[49:05] crippled up. But when we got to David's
[49:06] table, he looked like everyone else. And
[49:08] God's called us to his table. We can
[49:10] have a bountiful feast that spiritually
[49:12] we're not starving but we're fat and
[49:14] flourishing.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we can have expectation
[49:18] there's no end to this food. Amen. God's
[49:20] not going to withhold his his word from
[49:22] us. No, he's going to keep pouring it in
[49:24] and pouring it in and he's going to
[49:26] prove what he's given us and we're going
[49:27] to have an expectation that he's not
[49:29] giving us just theory. It's going to
[49:30] become reality. It's going to have a
[49:32] practical outworking in our lives.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Simeon was under great
[49:38] expectation cuz the Lord spoke to him.
[49:40] It wasn't just a hope. It was an
[49:42] expectation because it was a genuine
[49:44] revelation. And it didn't matter what
[49:46] others thought about it. It wasn't
[49:48] theirs. It was his. So people may look
[49:50] at you and say, "You're crazy. You've
[49:52] gone out of your mind. What are you
[49:54] following this thing?" And you've just
[49:55] gone overboard and just be like everyone
[49:57] else. But you're under expectation. See,
[49:59] because God spoke to you. Amen. God
[50:01] quickened his word to you. Amen. So you
[50:03] So So it's just not to them yet, but
[50:05] it's to you. So you can just rejoice and
[50:07] praise God knowing it's going to it's
[50:08] going to be fulfilled
[50:11] during that same time. Well, uh you
[50:13] know, so so when Jesus was born, there
[50:16] were shepherds in the field. There were
[50:19] shepherds in the field and and Jesus, we
[50:22] understand, was born in spring cuz he
[50:23] was the lamb of God. He wasn't born in
[50:25] December, but we celebrated it. We can
[50:26] celebrate it every day. Why not just
[50:28] have a big Christmas feast every day?
[50:29] That's good. We can do it, you know. But
[50:32] you know BC so so it was a springtime
[50:33] and the lambs and you know there were
[50:35] the shepherds and they were they were
[50:37] they were there just you know minding
[50:38] the sheep no doubt watching the use as
[50:40] they were lamming and you know but then
[50:42] suddenly there was an angel of the Lord
[50:43] came and spoke to them and it threw them
[50:46] into an expectation because they were
[50:49] told they were told by this angel that
[50:51] you shall find the babe wrapped in
[50:53] swaddling clothes laying in a manger. So
[50:56] before before that they just had a
[50:58] natural expectation. We're going to mind
[50:59] all of our lambs and you know we're just
[51:01] here looking after the sheep. And no
[51:03] doubt you know you know because they
[51:05] were Israelites they would have talked
[51:06] about the Lord and talked about prophecy
[51:08] and things. But when that angel came to
[51:10] them and and and said you you will find
[51:13] him in a specific place. Wasn't a vague
[51:16] promise. It was go to Bethlehem. You'll
[51:18] find the manger. You'll find him wrapped
[51:20] a certain way laying in a manger exactly
[51:22] as you exactly this way. And now this
[51:25] threw them in expectation that angel's
[51:28] message is true because it's a
[51:29] scriptural message. Amen. Because it was
[51:32] prophesied in the Bible that he would
[51:33] come out of Bethlehem. So they had an
[51:35] authority because brother Bram was was
[51:38] you know asked by people about the
[51:40] baptism and the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:41] Christ and different things. And you
[51:43] know someone said well you know did the
[51:44] angel of the Lord tell you that you know
[51:46] that that this is how it should be and
[51:48] cuz we believe the angel and brother
[51:49] said if the angel of the Lord said
[51:51] anything contrary to the word I wouldn't
[51:53] believe him. and he's not the angel of
[51:54] the Lord. So everything must line up
[51:56] with the scripture. So when your
[51:57] expectation matches the scripture, you
[51:59] can have a real expectation knowing that
[52:01] God will fulfill it. Amen. So what did
[52:03] they do? They left their sheep. They ran
[52:05] into Bethlehem. And what did they find?
[52:07] Now I know we all know the story, but
[52:09] put yourself there. Okay? They're being
[52:11] told by an angel, you're going to see
[52:13] the Messiah. He's born tonight. He's not
[52:16] It's not even in the future. Right now,
[52:18] real time, he's born. He's in a manger
[52:20] in that city. You'll find him. Okay? So
[52:24] they what did they do? They ran into the
[52:26] city and they found they found him
[52:30] exactly where the angel said he would
[52:32] be. They didn't find him in a house.
[52:34] They didn't find him in a bed. They
[52:37] didn't find him even some of the things
[52:39] the angel said. Exactly as the angel
[52:41] said is exactly as he was found. Amen.
[52:44] And this is why they could have such
[52:46] confidence that that this angel's
[52:48] message did not lead them up some back
[52:50] alley in Bethlehem with no no Messiah
[52:52] there, but it led them straight to the
[52:54] Messiah. And we know that this message
[52:57] is a true message from God because the
[53:00] seventh angel messenger told us exactly
[53:02] where you'll find Jesus Christ. He
[53:04] didn't say you'll find him in a creed or
[53:06] a tradition. You'll find him in his word
[53:08] because he is his word. Amen. And after
[53:11] they met, after they ran into the ran
[53:13] into the manger and they saw the Lord
[53:15] exactly as the angel said, they
[53:18] broadcast everywhere saying what that
[53:19] angel told us on the hillside. Amen.
[53:21] We've seen it in flesh. And they became
[53:24] living witnesses. Amen. Their
[53:26] expectation was met. And then they took
[53:28] that expectation to Taliban, listen, God
[53:30] sent an angel to us. And he has revealed
[53:33] to us where he was. And we've seen him.
[53:36] We can point him. We can point you to
[53:38] him. He didn't disappear after he left.
[53:39] He's still on the earth. Amen. It's the
[53:41] same thing with us. Amen. That the
[53:43] message of brother Brandham has pointed
[53:45] us where Jesus Christ is in his word.
[53:47] And we've seen and we've tasted and God
[53:50] is transformed. Amen. When the angel
[53:52] said you can receive the baptism of the
[53:54] Holy Ghost the same as in the day of
[53:55] Pentecost just like in the book of Acts.
[53:58] That is a book of Acts being rewritten
[53:59] in this day. Amen. It wasn't an empty
[54:02] promise. It was a reality cuz we are
[54:04] witnesses. Amen. That what he said that
[54:07] you can really be born again. that God
[54:09] can really live in your life. Amen. You
[54:11] can become A LIVING TABERNACLE OF THE
[54:13] LIVING GOD. AMEN. What he said, we've
[54:15] experienced and we know it's true.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So we can
[54:21] rejoice. We can BROADCAST THIS
[54:23] EVERYWHERE SAYING THAT THE GOD of the
[54:25] Bible still lives. Amen. HE'S MORE THAN
[54:27] TRADITION. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
[54:29] EVERYONE else has done with him. He's
[54:30] still alive. Amen. His word is right.
[54:32] His word is fulfilled. If you just take
[54:35] FAITH AND TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. AMEN.
[54:37] The expectation that we came under to
[54:39] receive it. Amen. You will receive it in
[54:40] the same way.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What they do? They made
[54:43] so they ran. They made haste. They found
[54:45] Mary, Joseph, and the babe laying in the
[54:47] manger. They found him exactly as the
[54:49] message said. Amen. And then they
[54:51] returned glorifying and praising God for
[54:53] all the things they had heard and seen
[54:55] as it was told unto them. And I say
[54:57] friends, in this Christmas season or
[54:59] doesn't matter what season we're in, we
[55:00] can go glorifying God and praising him
[55:03] because he proves his word over and over
[55:06] and over again.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Because this gospel we
[55:11] have is not just a word only. It's not
[55:13] just an argument or a nice idea. No,
[55:15] they literally saw the living Messiah on
[55:18] the earth. Amen. They didn't just hear
[55:20] about him. They didn't hear a doctrine
[55:21] about him. They saw him alive in flesh.
[55:25] Amen. It's the same thing with you and I
[55:26] friends. The real believer sees the
[55:28] Messiah in flesh in this day. Where does
[55:31] the believer see him? In themselves
[55:34] first. Amen. And if you can see him on
[55:36] the inside, you can see him in one
[55:38] another. Amen. So the so the gospel that
[55:41] we've received is not just word only,
[55:43] but in power and demonstration and in
[55:45] much assurance. Amen. There's much
[55:48] assurance because the expectation God
[55:50] has given us is not empty. It's not just
[55:52] left hanging. is not something that's
[55:54] unfulfilled and maybe one day, no, it
[55:57] becomes a living reality today.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we can go
[56:02] praising God like the shepherds because
[56:04] they weren't waiting one day. He's going
[56:05] to turn. No, the angel said he's here
[56:07] upon the earth now.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And that was their message. The angel's
[56:12] message became their message. Messiah is
[56:14] upon the earth now. And we have the same
[56:17] message, friends. Jesus Christ is on
[56:19] earth now. Where is he? He's in his
[56:21] people.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. living, doing, working,
[56:24] fulfilling his word in our lives. What a
[56:27] great Christmas. Praise the Lord. Merry
[56:29] Christmas, everyone. Hallelujah. It's
[56:32] the greatest present we could ever have
[56:34] is eternal life.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, it works in every
[56:38] condition. Praise the Lord.
[56:41] Amen. And you know, so, so who are we
[56:43] hailing today? We are not hailing a babe
[56:46] in a manger. We're not even hailing a
[56:50] 12-year-old boy in the temple. We are
[56:53] hailing a resurrected Jesus Christ.
[56:56] Amen. We are not hailing a dead man in a
[56:59] tomb. Though many people want him to
[57:01] stay dead because that means they can do
[57:02] what they want in their lives. No, we
[57:04] want a living God. Amen. A one that
[57:07] lives, speaks, deals, counsels, guides,
[57:09] protects, heals. Amen. Comforts. We want
[57:12] a living God. Amen. We don't want a dead
[57:14] tradition. Amen. The shepherds found a
[57:16] living God in a in a manger. You'll find
[57:18] a living God in his word today. Amen.
[57:20] And it's what brother Brand would say in
[57:22] the greatest news flashash in history.
[57:23] He says, "Can you imagine if this school
[57:25] had a basketball team or ba uh baseball
[57:28] basketball team? They went out and
[57:30] conquered their foe and returned back."
[57:32] You know, we had a great rivalry. When I
[57:34] was at school, there was us in
[57:35] Oakuckland Grammar with the first 15. I
[57:37] don't know if we won that match. I can't
[57:38] remember. But, you know, if we won, it
[57:40] would have been a big hurrah. You know,
[57:41] it wouldn't have been a bravo boys go
[57:43] back. You know there would have been a
[57:45] great celebration because their victory
[57:47] you know our school's pride and prestige
[57:49] was resting on if they beat the foe. I
[57:51] mean so could you imagine if your team
[57:53] or whoever you know you know it's like
[57:55] if New Zealand wins the World Cup or the
[57:57] spring box more likely you know win the
[57:59] World Cup the winners never just sit
[58:02] there and go
[58:04] have you ever se I think it's the soccer
[58:05] world cup next year. You see those teams
[58:08] if they're winning man their whole
[58:09] country erupts you know they're not just
[58:11] going bravo and that was a good game.
[58:13] you know, they're they're dancing on
[58:15] street poles. They're done. You know,
[58:16] they're flipping cars. They're doing
[58:17] crazy stuff cuz their team won.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine them saying, "Oh, well
[58:21] done." And just go back and we're just
[58:23] going to keep living life. No, they
[58:24] celebrate what they're doing. Amen.
[58:26] Because the because the expectation
[58:28] their team the expectation their team
[58:30] will win has been met. Now, how much
[58:32] more now the expectation of our living
[58:35] Lord Jesus, Amen. Conquering hell,
[58:37] death, and the grave. Amen. Fighting
[58:39] your battles. Amen. Overcoming in your
[58:41] life. Amen. That doesn't mean we just
[58:43] say, "Oh, well done, Lord. Thank you so
[58:44] much." No. No. There's something in us.
[58:46] There's a victory shout. Amen. There's a
[58:48] dance. Amen. That comes into our lives.
[58:50] Amen. Why? Because we realize it's not
[58:52] just some some some dirty funeral march.
[58:55] No. It's a victorious walk. And it's a
[58:57] victorious life. Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:59] There's a real salute. Amen. He says,
[59:01] "Could you imagine them standing there
[59:02] singing some little old song like near
[59:04] my God to thee?" To them. [snorts] No
[59:07] way. Oh, they're blowing their flags.
[59:09] They're hailing them. in their making.
[59:10] How about when m uh Napoleon came back?
[59:12] How about Stalin when he went into
[59:14] Germany? How they fired the guns, done
[59:15] the slute, and did their legs across
[59:17] that Russian slute. How about our boys
[59:19] returning home from their victory? The
[59:21] whistles blowed. The people went wild.
[59:23] They shot guns, they screamed, they rang
[59:24] bells. Why? We had conquered our enemy
[59:26] glory. And today, you' think you've got
[59:29] some kind of a morg go to a church and
[59:31] say, "We believe in God the Father
[59:33] Almighty. We believe in a resurrected
[59:34] Jesus Christ. Amen. A conqueror of hell,
[59:36] death, and the grave. I believe that
[59:38] he's alive tonight and in this building
[59:39] alive with us according to his promise
[59:41] where the two or three are gathered
[59:42] together I'll be there in their midst.
[59:44] No sir, not at some funeral service but
[59:46] hailing a mighty conqueror. Amen. We can
[59:49] have an expectation he's the mighty
[59:51] conqueror. Amen. That the victory he won
[59:53] that day on Calvary, he's here to
[59:55] fulfill that victory in our lives. Amen.
[59:57] That we're not just looking back and
[59:58] saying yes, he was 2,000 years ago. We
[1:00:01] can say he is tonight or this morning.
[1:00:03] Amen. And what do we do when we pray?
[1:00:05] and we open our word or we come to we
[1:00:08] come to church, we have our family
[1:00:09] prayer, we're hailing a mighty
[1:00:11] conqueror. Amen. The risen, resurrected,
[1:00:13] allconquering one is in our midst. Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we can have an
[1:00:18] expectation. Lord, you're a conqueror.
[1:00:20] And you don't change your ways. He's a
[1:00:23] conqueror back then. He's conquering
[1:00:24] today.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see, we've got
[1:00:28] to have the right expectation. Israel
[1:00:30] had the wrong expectation when when when
[1:00:33] when Jesus was born. That's why that's
[1:00:36] why the angels went to the shepherds,
[1:00:37] those ignorant shepherds on the on the
[1:00:39] hillside. He didn't go to the
[1:00:40] synagogues. He didn't go to the high
[1:00:42] priest. He went to those shepherds
[1:00:44] because everyone else was in a wrong
[1:00:46] expectation. They were expecting a
[1:00:48] messiah to come like a mighty king.
[1:00:51] Amen. That you know that, you know, they
[1:00:52] wanted a king to deliver them because
[1:00:54] they wanted a Messiah to match what they
[1:00:56] thought their need was. And their need
[1:00:58] wasn't an independent nation. You know,
[1:01:01] their need wasn't a sovereign country.
[1:01:03] No, their need was salvation from sin.
[1:01:06] Amen. So someone to come come and
[1:01:08] conquer sin, to conquer death, hell, and
[1:01:11] the grave. Amen. That they could have
[1:01:12] eternal life. But they were expecting a
[1:01:14] mighty king. They wanted that. Amen.
[1:01:17] Because if they had a mighty king, they
[1:01:18] would not have to change their ways. He
[1:01:20] would fight the battle for them and they
[1:01:22] could continue on. And it's much like
[1:01:23] today the modern church world. They want
[1:01:25] some great Superman to come and and and
[1:01:27] and and bring a Christian revival that
[1:01:30] will save the world.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Well, he's already come.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus. He is his word. Amen.
[1:01:36] But the problem is they want revival,
[1:01:38] but they don't want the the cost of
[1:01:39] revival, which is a death to self to lay
[1:01:42] aside tradition and let him be Messiah.
[1:01:45] Let him be the Lord of all. Amen.
[1:01:47] They're expecting some kind of king that
[1:01:49] they just step down of from the
[1:01:50] corridors of heaven, walk down to the
[1:01:52] earth in a full angel salute and the
[1:01:54] father would look out of heaven say,
[1:01:55] "I'm sending down to you now the
[1:01:57] Messiah." And they had it all fixed up
[1:01:58] that that's the way he was supposed to
[1:02:00] come. See, they were preaching that in
[1:02:02] their churches that it gave the wrong
[1:02:03] expectation.
[1:02:06] But what did they get? They got a baby
[1:02:08] instead of a mighty king. A baby born in
[1:02:10] a little stable, the side of a hillside,
[1:02:12] a little cave stable with straw and the
[1:02:14] manure from the animals. They had a baby
[1:02:17] and it was the answer to their prayer.
[1:02:18] It's exactly what they needed, but they
[1:02:21] wanted it their own way. They want it
[1:02:23] the way they thought was best. But God
[1:02:24] knows how to send it the way he knows is
[1:02:26] best because he is an infinite God and
[1:02:29] he knows just how to send it. See, God
[1:02:32] answers prayer how how he wants to
[1:02:34] answer prayer. Many times we go to God
[1:02:36] in prayer with the how we want it
[1:02:38] answered. Now Lord, just do it this way.
[1:02:40] Thank you, Lord. Amen. God answers
[1:02:42] prayer how he wants to. Amen. Because
[1:02:44] remember when we when we take our needs
[1:02:46] before the Lord, God's going to be
[1:02:47] working. He's not going to just be
[1:02:49] working on your request. He's going to
[1:02:51] be working on you. I mean, he's going to
[1:02:52] be giving bringing character into your
[1:02:54] life. The pay patience. Amen. He's going
[1:02:56] to be molding you as the answer's on its
[1:02:59] way. God [snorts] is very He's very
[1:03:02] thorough in how he answers things.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now, if they just
[1:03:08] rallied, those shepherds rallied around
[1:03:11] that great gift. I'm just finding where
[1:03:14] I am. Sorry.
[1:03:17] What' they get? They got a baby in a
[1:03:19] manger.
[1:03:21] You see, Israel,
[1:03:25] Israel, if they rallied around the gift
[1:03:27] in that day, they would have had another
[1:03:29] golden age.
[1:03:31] Because
[1:03:33] you see, brother Ram would say like like
[1:03:36] in like in Solomon's day, he said when
[1:03:39] they rallied around the gift of
[1:03:40] discernment in their king, Israel had a
[1:03:42] golden age. They had peace all around
[1:03:45] them. Their enemies were afraid of them.
[1:03:47] And during that time, the temple was
[1:03:50] being built. And I tell you what,
[1:03:52] friends, if we just rally around the
[1:03:54] gift of the Holy Ghost in this day,
[1:03:57] amen, we will have peace within our
[1:03:59] souls. you will truly find rest. Amen.
[1:04:02] That you know the world it doesn't mean
[1:04:04] the world will be absence of peace but
[1:04:06] the Lord said my peace I give unto you
[1:04:08] not as the world gives because the world
[1:04:10] gives peace and that peace is an absence
[1:04:12] of trouble but God gives a peace in the
[1:04:14] presence of trouble. I mean to prove his
[1:04:17] peace is different. Amen. But as we
[1:04:19] rallied like the shepherds they rallied
[1:04:21] around the gift of eternal life that
[1:04:23] came their way. And I believe we're say
[1:04:25] made of the same material as those
[1:04:27] shepherds. Amen. where we have heard, we
[1:04:29] have seen, we've experienced, now we're
[1:04:31] telling and we're living. Amen. The fact
[1:04:33] the Messiah is upon the earth today. And
[1:04:35] so now we have God has given us grace to
[1:04:37] rally around the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:40] And it gives us a golden age.
[1:04:44] Well, how can we have a golden age? The
[1:04:45] economics, there's trouble, there's
[1:04:47] strife, there's war, the No, there's a
[1:04:49] golden age amongst the bride of Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ. Because in Solomon's day, what
[1:04:54] was going on? that when that golden age
[1:04:56] came, the temple was put together. The
[1:04:58] house of God was put together. Amen.
[1:05:00] What's going on in this golden age? God
[1:05:02] is taking people from all around the
[1:05:04] world, taking them out of the muck of
[1:05:06] sin, stones for the building. Amen. And
[1:05:08] he's shaping us and molding us and he's
[1:05:10] putting us in our position in the body
[1:05:12] of Christ. Praise the Lord. That's an
[1:05:15] incredible thing. This is what eternal
[1:05:16] life does. Amen. It molds and shapes us.
[1:05:19] Amen. So that's why we can we can rally
[1:05:21] around Amen. this great gift of eternal
[1:05:24] life. And he gives us a peace that
[1:05:27] passes all understanding because he is
[1:05:30] still Jehovah Shalom. Amen. It doesn't
[1:05:32] matter how bad the world gets, God is
[1:05:34] always greater.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when when you receive
[1:05:39] this gift of eternal life now, and and
[1:05:41] I'm not saying you haven't, but you see,
[1:05:43] it's not just it's not just for you, but
[1:05:45] it spreads like the shepherds took that
[1:05:48] living message and they spread it to
[1:05:49] everyone who would hear them. Okay? Now,
[1:05:51] but it puts you into a great
[1:05:53] expectation. Now, you take when when
[1:05:55] Jesus I mean, sorry, when Paul Well, you
[1:05:56] could say Jesus because Jesus was in
[1:05:58] Paul and Silas, but when they were in
[1:05:59] the inner prison there, they just
[1:06:01] preached, they had been beaten, they
[1:06:02] were put there in the inner prison, and
[1:06:04] you know, they begin to pray and sing
[1:06:05] psalms around midnight, talk about the
[1:06:07] goodness of God. Amen. And God, you
[1:06:09] having a testimony meeting among
[1:06:11] themselves. Praise the Lord. And God
[1:06:13] came down, shook the place, opened every
[1:06:16] door, broke every chain. Now the now the
[1:06:18] jailer before they were put in prison,
[1:06:20] he was under an expectation. If these
[1:06:22] people escape, you're dead. Okay? So now
[1:06:25] the place shakes. He's heard their
[1:06:26] singing. Sure. But he's under this
[1:06:28] expectation. I'm going to die if these
[1:06:30] people get, you know, get out. Then the
[1:06:32] place shakes. Their chains are broken.
[1:06:34] The doors come open. Now he's under
[1:06:36] another expectation. I'm going to die.
[1:06:38] Right? But then what happened? He heard
[1:06:40] a voice. He heard a voice from the inner
[1:06:42] prison. Don't kill yourself. We're all
[1:06:44] still here. I mean, so that threw him
[1:06:47] into a different expectation. I mean,
[1:06:49] that the God that they were singing
[1:06:50] about was a real God. No doubt he had
[1:06:52] heard singing in pagan temples before,
[1:06:55] but this was different. I mean, so it
[1:06:56] put him into a different expectation.
[1:06:59] What must I do to be saved? Says, now an
[1:07:01] expectation, I can get saved. Amen. This
[1:07:03] God that they sung about that shook the
[1:07:05] place can actually give me salvation.
[1:07:08] And then it didn't just do that, but
[1:07:10] when when he asked the question to Paul
[1:07:12] and Silas, he says, "Sers, what must I
[1:07:14] do to be saved?" And they said, "Believe
[1:07:16] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and
[1:07:18] thy house shall be saved." So now put
[1:07:21] him into an expectation for himself and
[1:07:24] for his house. Like brother Bram says,
[1:07:26] "So in other words, believe on the Lord
[1:07:29] Jesus Christ for thy house and they'll
[1:07:32] be saved." So the same faith that God
[1:07:34] gave you for your salvation, now apply
[1:07:36] it to your house. Be under expectation
[1:07:38] that if the same faith worked on you,
[1:07:41] it'll work on them. Put faith into
[1:07:43] action. Amen. Create an atmosphere,
[1:07:45] sorry, pardon me. Create an atmosphere
[1:07:48] around you of divine love. I mean, look
[1:07:50] beyond what you see with the five
[1:07:51] senses. Amen. Don't combat things
[1:07:53] carnally. Amen. But use, let God give
[1:07:56] you inspiration and understanding and
[1:07:58] wisdom. That's not how much you can
[1:08:00] control. your family will dictate they
[1:08:02] get eternal life. No, it doesn't work
[1:08:03] that way. It's creating atmosphere of
[1:08:05] divine love, letting God because you're
[1:08:07] an atmosphere creator. If you're grumpy,
[1:08:10] it'll create a grumpy atmosphere. If
[1:08:11] you're tense, you'll create a tense
[1:08:13] atmosphere. If you're fighting, what
[1:08:15] kind of atmosphere that is. But if
[1:08:16] you're a peaceable person, you're a
[1:08:18] peacemaker. You're not a gossip. You
[1:08:20] love everybody. You're you appreciate
[1:08:22] seeing everyone. You appreciate your
[1:08:24] family. That creates an atmosphere.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And brother says they'll drop right into
[1:08:29] it.
[1:08:30] So we should be under expectation. Lord,
[1:08:32] you save me, you're going to save them.
[1:08:35] Amen. Hallelujah. And I'm not looking by
[1:08:37] my five senses. I'm not looking what I
[1:08:38] see, I hear, I, you know, those things.
[1:08:40] No, my expectation overrides those
[1:08:43] things. Can you imagine Simeon if he
[1:08:45] was, you know, if he let the fact that
[1:08:47] he was old, am I really going to see the
[1:08:50] baby? Is this really going to happen?
[1:08:52] But his expectation, because it was a
[1:08:53] revelation, he said, "Well, I could die
[1:08:55] tomorrow, but before I die, I'm going to
[1:08:56] see him. That means it's going to happen
[1:08:58] soon. Amen. So it should, you know, we
[1:09:02] have a real godly expectation. It brings
[1:09:03] the promise into today. Amen. Because
[1:09:06] faith brings it into today. It's like
[1:09:08] Jesus said to Mary and Martha, you know,
[1:09:09] he talked to them about Lazarus and they
[1:09:11] both said, you know, one day he will
[1:09:12] raise in the resurrection in the last
[1:09:14] day. But Jesus said, "I am the
[1:09:16] resurrection and the life." In other
[1:09:17] words, what he did is he took the
[1:09:18] promise that they were looking way in
[1:09:20] the future for and he brought it into
[1:09:22] today. I am present tense the
[1:09:24] resurrection and the life. And that's
[1:09:25] what an expectation of the word does. It
[1:09:27] brings the brings the promise that
[1:09:29] somewhere out there maybe one day and
[1:09:31] brings it into the present.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Do you have that kind of Bible
[1:09:35] expectation? Amen. God will do what he
[1:09:37] promised to do.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Now this great thing about this gift of
[1:09:41] eternal life is that this what we rally
[1:09:44] around
[1:09:45] is it gives us overcoming power.
[1:09:49] First John 4 it says, "Beloved, believe
[1:09:51] not every spirit, but try the spirits
[1:09:52] whether they are of God because many
[1:09:54] false prophets have gone out into the
[1:09:55] world. Hereby we know the spirit of God.
[1:09:57] Every spirit that confessth confesseth
[1:09:59] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:10:01] is of God. So he is in flesh present
[1:10:04] now. Right? And every spirit that
[1:10:05] confessth not that Jesus Christ has come
[1:10:07] in the flesh is not of God. And this is
[1:10:09] the spirit of Antichrist. Where of ye
[1:10:11] have heard that it should come and even
[1:10:13] now already is in the world.
[1:10:16] I'm glad he doesn't stop there. Ye are
[1:10:19] of God, little children, and have
[1:10:21] overcome them because greater is he
[1:10:23] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:10:25] world. Amen. So therefore, we we don't
[1:10:29] need to fear nothing. No spirit, no
[1:10:33] power of hell, no scheme of man because
[1:10:36] he says here, you have already you have
[1:10:38] overcome them. Not one day you will. You
[1:10:41] have overcome them. Amen. There's people
[1:10:43] warn about antichrist spirits. There's
[1:10:45] many different It's everything that
[1:10:46] opposes the word is an antichrist
[1:10:48] spirit. But we don't need to fear a
[1:10:50] single one of them because greater is he
[1:10:53] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:10:54] world.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no power or even near
[1:10:58] equal to this gift of eternal life which
[1:11:01] is the Holy Ghost in your life. See, it
[1:11:03] takes all the fear out of us. Oh, but
[1:11:07] what if something gets me? He already
[1:11:08] got the Lord already got me. We're I'm
[1:11:11] his. I'm his lamb. He's stronger than
[1:11:14] them all. Amen. Nothing can pluck me out
[1:11:16] of his hands. This is what this gift of
[1:11:18] eternal I'm just going into now what it
[1:11:20] does. I mean, it doesn't just save our
[1:11:22] soul, but it gives us overcoming power
[1:11:24] to daily be victorious.
[1:11:26] Amen. So, you know, superstitions
[1:11:29] superstitions give power to the enemy.
[1:11:34] We don't need to we don't ever need to
[1:11:37] let a superstition
[1:11:39] uh control our lives. You know, it's
[1:11:42] amazing how people will will actually
[1:11:44] have a lot of faith in in witchcraft
[1:11:47] working. You know, some some some you
[1:11:51] know, a spiritualist or, you know, a
[1:11:53] witch or something, you know, will will
[1:11:55] cast a spell on someone and for some
[1:11:57] reason we people fear those believers
[1:12:00] fear those things. They actually have
[1:12:01] faith that what they do will work. We
[1:12:04] actually have fear about those people
[1:12:06] have fear about those things. Why would
[1:12:08] we why would we fear that when greater
[1:12:11] is he that's in you than he that's in
[1:12:12] the world?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Why do we have to fear? It doesn't
[1:12:14] matter if every witch lined up and tried
[1:12:17] to curse a son or daughter of God.
[1:12:19] They're under the blood. Nothing can
[1:12:21] destroy them. I mean, when brother
[1:12:22] Brandon was preaching in Germany and
[1:12:24] they already warned him not, you know,
[1:12:25] they're going to destroy that tent that
[1:12:27] was built and all those witches were
[1:12:28] lined up in the audience and, you know,
[1:12:30] casting their spells, bringing a storm
[1:12:32] to destroy that thing. Amen. Who who
[1:12:34] packed the victory in that thing? Amen.
[1:12:37] God anointed his prophet and showed that
[1:12:39] a redeemed son or daughter of God has
[1:12:41] dominion over every work of the enemy.
[1:12:44] Amen. Because the because the tent was
[1:12:46] literally moving. The storm was
[1:12:47] literally there. It would have literally
[1:12:49] blown the thing apart. Amen. But a son
[1:12:51] of God stood there knowing who he was,
[1:12:55] knowing what eternal life does for him.
[1:12:57] Amen. And he stood there and he rebuked
[1:12:58] that thing and the leader fell over like
[1:13:00] in a coma and the sun came out. That
[1:13:03] wind stopped and thousands packed the
[1:13:04] altar. Why? Because God was challenged
[1:13:07] and the you know and God accepted the
[1:13:09] challenge of the enemy and God packed
[1:13:11] out the victory. Amen. Oh, you say
[1:13:12] that's the prophet of God. You're
[1:13:14] redeemed by the same blood. Amen. The
[1:13:16] same Holy Ghost is in you. Amen. You do
[1:13:18] not need to fear anything that tries to
[1:13:20] come against you. Remember, no weapon
[1:13:22] formed against you shall prosper. Amen.
[1:13:24] We don't need to fear nothing because
[1:13:26] we've rallied around the gift of eternal
[1:13:28] life.
[1:13:30] [snorts]
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, but they cast their
[1:13:32] spell. But that's weird because well
[1:13:34] what about your prayers?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe your prayers? I'm going
[1:13:38] to come to that real soon. But you know
[1:13:40] don't you believe what you ask you shall
[1:13:42] receive.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Because if people have faith well
[1:13:44] they're going to do their thing. It's
[1:13:45] going to happen. What about you under
[1:13:47] the blood of Jesus Christ? Amen. Where
[1:13:48] the blood puts you on speaking terms
[1:13:50] with God. And they're not talking to
[1:13:51] God. They're talking to the devil. And
[1:13:53] the devil's got to get permission from
[1:13:54] your God to do whatever he does. Amen.
[1:13:56] But you have dominion over every work of
[1:13:58] the enemy.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must believe our weapon is is
[1:14:02] stronger.
[1:14:04] Amen. He says here in the greatest
[1:14:05] battle ever fought, see his attack.
[1:14:07] Watch, listen close. Uh this closing his
[1:14:10] attack is what? Disbelieve God's word.
[1:14:11] That's his attack. Um there. Can you see
[1:14:14] the greatest battle was ever fought?
[1:14:15] There's only two forces, Satan and God.
[1:14:17] And what is Satan's weapon against you
[1:14:19] is to try to get you to disbelieve your
[1:14:21] weapon. He disarms you. Let's listen
[1:14:24] real quiet. Now listen. If he can get
[1:14:26] you to dis get you to disbelieve your
[1:14:28] weapon is equivalent. I think too I
[1:14:30] think he meant to believe your weapon is
[1:14:31] equivalent. If he gets you to believe
[1:14:33] that your weapon is not strong enough,
[1:14:34] he has disarmed you. He says, "Oh,
[1:14:36] brother Neville, I hope we never believe
[1:14:38] that." Amen. So I I pray we never
[1:14:41] believe that that that our weapon is not
[1:14:44] strong enough. Our weapon is strong
[1:14:46] enough. It's been proven down through
[1:14:48] the ages. Amen. It was manifested as a
[1:14:50] rod of deliverance out of Egypt. The
[1:14:52] children of Israel came out of Egypt.
[1:14:54] Amen. And it was proven there in Noah's
[1:14:56] day building the ark. It was, you know,
[1:14:57] they rode above the judgment. Amen. It
[1:14:59] was there manifested in Jesus Christ. He
[1:15:01] conquered hell, death, and the grave.
[1:15:03] That same power is in you and I. Amen.
[1:15:05] So our weapon is not just not um you
[1:15:08] know, it is far more powerful. It is far
[1:15:10] more greater because greater is he
[1:15:11] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:15:13] world.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] Now remember, we have the privilege this
[1:15:19] day to enforce upon. So it doesn't
[1:15:22] matter. Don't don't ever get
[1:15:23] superstitious. Let the superstitions
[1:15:26] die. The thought that witchcraft can
[1:15:28] destroy you. Let that die. Oh, you know
[1:15:30] people like you like sisters, you know,
[1:15:32] mothers and you know, wives, they live
[1:15:34] in fear. What if a lust spirit gets my
[1:15:36] husband or my or my son? What's greater?
[1:15:40] Your prayer or that spirit? What's
[1:15:42] greater? Amen. You You intercede for
[1:15:45] your family. You don't need to pray out
[1:15:47] of fear, but of faith and assurance.
[1:15:49] God, you're my shield. and you're their
[1:15:51] shield, God. I'm your child. They're
[1:15:53] your children. God, you're more than
[1:15:55] enough. Amen. I don't need to fear
[1:15:56] nothing the enemy can turn against us
[1:15:58] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:16:00] he that's in the world. Amen. God hears
[1:16:02] your prayers. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother
[1:16:05] asked a question. Who has more authority
[1:16:07] with God? An archangel that never fell
[1:16:10] or a or a sinner that just got washed in
[1:16:12] the blood 10 seconds ago?
[1:16:14] The sinner that's no longer a sinner has
[1:16:17] more authority with God than an
[1:16:18] archangel that stood there for eons of
[1:16:20] time and never fell. It's someone who's
[1:16:23] come under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:25] Because when you begin to talk, God
[1:16:27] basically says, "Angels, be quiet. My
[1:16:29] daughter's talking to me. My son's
[1:16:30] talking to me. They are more important
[1:16:32] to me than you angels." Praise the Lord.
[1:16:35] Well, we got to realize we have contact
[1:16:36] with God. Amen. This gift of eternal
[1:16:39] life is the answer to every problem.
[1:16:42] Never ever think that it's something's
[1:16:44] too complex or there's no way out. There
[1:16:46] is a way out. Remember, with every
[1:16:48] temptation, he makes a way of escape.
[1:16:50] Well, what is the temptation in many
[1:16:52] situations? Just build a bunker and hide
[1:16:53] somewhere up in the hills, close down
[1:16:56] emotionally. That's not a way of escape.
[1:16:58] God will give you a way of escape. We
[1:17:01] got to be willing to step out of our
[1:17:03] comfort zone. Remember, it takes a hero
[1:17:05] to go beyond the hurt.
[1:17:08] A coward will hide, but we're not
[1:17:10] cowards this morning. We're rugged
[1:17:12] Christians, aren't we?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; There's a few here. Good.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Take courage, everyone. Be rugged.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It's worth walking in God's goodness
[1:17:19] than hiding in a hole somewhere.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz this gift of eternal life will
[1:17:23] break every barrier. It can heal every
[1:17:26] hurt. It can break every complex.
[1:17:29] There's nothing too hard for the Lord.
[1:17:31] I'm just convinced. I'm sorry. I've been
[1:17:33] here long enough to see God do too much
[1:17:35] to think, well, there's not a pro.
[1:17:36] There's no too hard basket in heaven.
[1:17:39] There's nothing too complex. He made
[1:17:41] your body. We just go down the science
[1:17:43] of what's happening in your body right
[1:17:45] now. It's a very complex machine. You
[1:17:47] know, it's like, you know, I think it's
[1:17:48] in Genesis, you know, he made the earth
[1:17:51] and and it's just like a phrase, he made
[1:17:52] the stars also. So, so, so, so it's just
[1:17:56] like a side comment. He made all this
[1:17:57] creation. Oh, yeah. And he made the
[1:17:59] universe. That's how God put it in his
[1:18:01] word, you know. So, what's too hard for
[1:18:03] the Lord? I think he can solve anything.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, this gift of eternal life
[1:18:08] has absolute power cuz it's God himself.
[1:18:12] And we have the privilege to enforce
[1:18:14] upon Satan. See, this this gift of
[1:18:16] eternal life, Jesus Christ, our Lord, is
[1:18:18] not passive. Amen. And believers are not
[1:18:20] passive either. They're active. Active
[1:18:22] in prayer. They know prayer changes
[1:18:24] things. Amen. Prayer makes things
[1:18:26] possible. When it appears to be
[1:18:28] impossible, it makes the possible. It
[1:18:29] makes it reality. And we have a
[1:18:31] privilege this morning to enforce upon
[1:18:34] Satan the claims that God gives us.
[1:18:37] Amen. Amen. For God has a law and his
[1:18:40] word is a law. And God is his uh in in
[1:18:43] this word made certain claims to the
[1:18:44] church. Therefore, we should we have a
[1:18:47] right to enforce these claims upon Satan
[1:18:49] and give it back. Amen. And he has to do
[1:18:52] it. See, this gives us an expectation.
[1:18:55] Remember everything Jesus Jesus promised
[1:18:57] us, he purchased for us on Calvary.
[1:18:59] Every redemptive blessing of God is
[1:19:01] yours. Take something in the message in
[1:19:04] the Bible, whatever promise it is, it is
[1:19:05] yours because he died that you would
[1:19:07] receive it. Amen. So now we have So we
[1:19:10] are now under a great expectation that
[1:19:13] every claim God has given us, we can
[1:19:15] enforce upon Satan that he has to give
[1:19:17] it back.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He has to do it because we can take
[1:19:21] God's agent, the Holy Ghost, go right
[1:19:22] down on our knees and say it's thus
[1:19:24] sayith the Lord. He's got to give it up.
[1:19:26] That's all because the Holy Spirit is
[1:19:28] there to make him do it. Amen. The law
[1:19:30] of the land is to enforce. It's by the
[1:19:32] law. I mean, it's by the land for the
[1:19:34] land. But the law of the spirit of God
[1:19:36] is to force Satan to give up that which
[1:19:39] he has unrightfully de deceitfully taken
[1:19:42] from God. Souls of men he took from God.
[1:19:45] Souls of women, children, sickness of
[1:19:46] the body, he placed upon people where
[1:19:48] God God made them in his image to be
[1:19:51] like him. And the church is given the
[1:19:53] rightful legal rights by the Bible to
[1:19:55] take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:19:58] upon him. You have that right. You have
[1:20:02] that right to enforce these things upon
[1:20:04] Satan that you can get down on your
[1:20:06] knees and pray through that the peace of
[1:20:08] God comes. And what's that now? The Holy
[1:20:10] Ghost is going to enforce what you have
[1:20:12] prayed. Because when we pray, we believe
[1:20:14] what we're going to that we're going to
[1:20:15] receive it. Right? We don't go through
[1:20:17] some ritual motion of well, I've said
[1:20:19] this prayer. You know, we believe what
[1:20:20] we're inspired to pray. It doesn't
[1:20:23] matter how you feel, but there's a faith
[1:20:25] that says, "Lord, I'm under expectation.
[1:20:27] All things in your word are mine, and I
[1:20:29] believe they're going to be enforced by
[1:20:31] you, and you're going to fulfill them."
[1:20:32] That we're not just now trying to work
[1:20:34] out how to fulfill prophecy in our own
[1:20:36] strength. How can we manipulate
[1:20:38] situations to make things come to pass?
[1:20:40] No. When you rest in God, and God's
[1:20:42] given you the answer, it's going to
[1:20:43] happen. You can rest in that. And then
[1:20:45] what do you do? You just water that
[1:20:47] promise with praise and thanksgiving.
[1:20:49] Amen. Knowing it's on its way. Can you
[1:20:51] imagine the appearance of that prodical
[1:20:52] son in the Bible? Amen. There came a
[1:20:55] season because this anchored in their
[1:20:56] hearts. Honey, we have a right to
[1:20:58] enforce upon Satan that he has to let
[1:21:01] our son go. But we don't know where he
[1:21:03] is. We can't talk to him. Honey, that
[1:21:05] doesn't matter. Amen. GOD IS GOD
[1:21:07] EVERYWHERE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT can
[1:21:09] hide anyone from from God. Amen. And God
[1:21:12] knows where he is. Amen. We can pray cuz
[1:21:15] PRAYER CHANGES THINGS. WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT
[1:21:16] to believe all THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:21:18] AMEN. AND GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE. And we
[1:21:20] don't look at where he is or what HE'S
[1:21:22] GOT INTO. WHAT SIN HE'S BURIED IN,
[1:21:24] THAT'S IRRELEVANT because he's one of
[1:21:26] ours. He's part of God. He's part of us.
[1:21:28] So therefore, we're going to enforce
[1:21:30] upon Satan now in faith that God is
[1:21:32] going to go.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; We're not going to go. God's going to
[1:21:35] go. Cuz honey, remember, we tried to go
[1:21:37] one time. It just it just it just caused
[1:21:39] a bigger rift. But we're going to send
[1:21:41] the right enforcing agent, the Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost. Amen. AND HE'S GOING TO GET OUR
[1:21:44] SON BACK. You know what brother said?
[1:21:46] They they knelt down. They prayed. THEY
[1:21:48] COMMITTED HIM TO GOD AND FAITH and a
[1:21:50] faith came. You know, a peace came and
[1:21:52] they said, "Now we now let's just praise
[1:21:54] him. Now let's just praise HIM." WE SAY,
[1:21:55] "WHEN'S HE COMING BACK, HONEY? That's
[1:21:57] irrelevant. Now we're going to water the
[1:21:59] promise CUZ GOD'S HEARD OUR PRAYERS.
[1:22:01] AMEN. GOD'S greater than the spirit that
[1:22:03] dragged them away and God's going to
[1:22:04] bring him back." Amen. And it wasn't
[1:22:06] that long after that. Well, I don't know
[1:22:08] the time frame, but time frames are irre
[1:22:10] are relevant to God. A what happened is
[1:22:12] that you that you that son was in the
[1:22:14] pig pen and the Bible says he came to
[1:22:16] himself. Do you know what that h what
[1:22:18] caused that wasn't his own mental
[1:22:20] understanding. Amen. It was actually
[1:22:22] this angel of the Lord came into the pig
[1:22:24] pen where he was and gave him a clear
[1:22:26] mind. Amen. Cuz those who are running in
[1:22:29] the world or just running away from God,
[1:22:30] they try to reason. I can make things
[1:22:32] better. I can get out of this problem. I
[1:22:35] can bring peace. If I just do this, get
[1:22:36] into this hobby, this job, this thing, I
[1:22:38] can get what I want. But that's not the
[1:22:40] right thinking. The right thinking is I
[1:22:42] just need to get back to father's house.
[1:22:44] I just need to get back to where God is.
[1:22:46] Amen. And so, so he came to himself. The
[1:22:49] angel of the Lord pushed that spirit off
[1:22:50] him and he came to himself realizing I
[1:22:53] should just go home.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What happened? They enforced upon
[1:22:57] Satan, Satan, you've got to give him
[1:22:59] back.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if someone if someone
[1:23:02] could do that now, Jesus said, now a
[1:23:04] certain man had two sons, right? So, so
[1:23:07] if you take that now in time, that's a
[1:23:09] man under the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus hadn't died yet.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; So, there was an Israelite, a a son of
[1:23:16] Abraham, circumcised believer under the
[1:23:18] blood of bulls and goats, and he could
[1:23:20] enforce upon Satan that God, you know,
[1:23:22] that God would restore his son back into
[1:23:24] the family. Same thing with, you know,
[1:23:26] Moses. He was under the blood of bulls
[1:23:27] and goats, and he called flies and
[1:23:29] plagues and brought a deliverance out
[1:23:31] of, you know, you know, Israel, out of
[1:23:33] Egypt. And brother Ram says, "Now, if a
[1:23:35] man under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:23:37] can do that kind of thing, how much more
[1:23:39] are people under the blood of Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ?" Amen. Where there's no longer a
[1:23:43] chasm between them and God, there's not
[1:23:45] some some some offering that just covers
[1:23:47] sin, but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:49] annihilates sin, annihilates the chasm,
[1:23:52] gives full restoration back between God
[1:23:54] and man. How much more are people in
[1:23:56] that condition?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hello, people in that condition.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; How you doing today? Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] [sighs]
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; It's in your power.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; This is what this is what eternal life
[1:24:09] does.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; We must have an expectation that God can
[1:24:14] do it.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; If you give any power to the devil, it
[1:24:20] gives him it just produces fear in your
[1:24:23] life.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And fear hath torment.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; But perfect love casts out all fear.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. to never ever let anything of his
[1:24:32] works have control in your life. How do
[1:24:34] you know it has control? You fear it. We
[1:24:36] don't need to fear nothing. We don't go
[1:24:38] looking for trouble. We understand that,
[1:24:39] right? Trouble finds us. But we can have
[1:24:43] full assurance that perfect love will
[1:24:45] cast out all fear. Amen. And we're
[1:24:47] living in a season of perfect love. If
[1:24:49] you got the Holy Ghost this morning, you
[1:24:51] have perfect love.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we don't need to
[1:24:55] fear nothing. We can walk with God. Now,
[1:24:57] let's just read this here. I'm just
[1:24:58] going to read a couple of promises cuz
[1:25:00] prayer prayer works.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. So Jesus would say, "Verily, I say
[1:25:04] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[1:25:06] this mountain, be thou removed and be
[1:25:09] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[1:25:10] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[1:25:12] that those things which he saith shall
[1:25:14] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:25:16] he saith." Remember this is this is when
[1:25:18] inspiration strikes you. Therefore, I
[1:25:20] say unto you, whatsoever things you
[1:25:22] desire when you pray, believe that you
[1:25:24] receive them. Do you believe what you
[1:25:27] pray for and you shall have them. And
[1:25:30] when you stand praying, forgive.
[1:25:33] Amen. This is see when when God comes
[1:25:35] into someone's life, you can't hold
[1:25:37] something against anybody.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You can't. It's just because eternal
[1:25:41] life comes in. You want to forgive
[1:25:43] everybody. You don't want any ought. You
[1:25:44] don't want any trouble. You just want
[1:25:46] peace cuz peace is coming to you. Amen.
[1:25:49] But you see now we're living in a season
[1:25:50] like brother Brown was challenged by the
[1:25:52] Lord one day to take him at his word and
[1:25:54] believe this when he's squirrel hunting.
[1:25:56] We know the creation of the squirrels,
[1:25:57] the fish got its life back. Had he
[1:25:59] writes two sons got eternal life, the
[1:26:01] storm, all all those things. That same
[1:26:03] power is within you and I. It should put
[1:26:06] us under expectation that God can do the
[1:26:09] impossible. And it's not and it's not us
[1:26:11] humanly saying now what do I want?
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; It's not that way at all. It's God
[1:26:15] controlling you.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we got to let God. We're going
[1:26:18] to be under We have to be under an
[1:26:20] expectation. Lord, you can do whatever
[1:26:22] you want, whenever you want in my life.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Amen. So, well, well, we
[1:26:30] need the prophet to have the power of
[1:26:31] the spoken word. No, that power is
[1:26:33] within you and I.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Like I've shared many times about the
[1:26:36] about the broken hot water cylinder that
[1:26:39] we had fully disconnected from the
[1:26:40] house. Gas was turned off. Everything
[1:26:43] was physically disconnected from the
[1:26:44] house. And you Jimmy was there. I know.
[1:26:46] Well, yeah, we'll do this again, but you
[1:26:47] know, but you know, it was it was Sunday
[1:26:50] morning. We had Tony and Sharon staying
[1:26:51] with us. We had no hot water whatsoever.
[1:26:53] It was disconnected on the Friday. And
[1:26:55] we, you know, and and we were boiling
[1:26:57] the jug and trying to get hot water to
[1:26:59] have a bath and things before church
[1:27:01] with that. And but, you know, before
[1:27:02] that, I just said without thinking, I
[1:27:04] said it to Christine a couple of times,
[1:27:05] you can have hot God loves you so much
[1:27:07] that he can give you hot water if he
[1:27:08] wants to. as a low part of things were
[1:27:11] heavy and think you know we're you know
[1:27:12] we were going through some things and I
[1:27:14] just said to her a couple of times she
[1:27:15] just took that from the Lord I believe
[1:27:17] and you know she went to fill the jug up
[1:27:20] with the with the shower upstairs and
[1:27:22] she turned it on and it was instantly
[1:27:24] hot water so she got had a shower now
[1:27:26] it's physically disconnected from the
[1:27:27] house it's physically impossible for us
[1:27:29] to have hot water right but what
[1:27:31] happened is something was spoken and she
[1:27:33] received it we can have God can if he
[1:27:36] wants to right and turns on the shower
[1:27:38] gets and has a hot shower. I have a hot
[1:27:40] shower. Jimmy's downstairs has half a
[1:27:42] hot shower. And then that was it.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; And the same plumber guy. What was that?
[1:27:50] Sorry.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I had a hot shower, too.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You had a hot shower, too. Okay. Sorry.
[1:27:54] You had You had a full hot shower. There
[1:27:56] was three hot showers going on. That was
[1:27:57] good blessing. E. Anyway, you see, and
[1:28:00] then and then on the Monday, the next
[1:28:01] day, the plumber who disconnected the
[1:28:03] whole hot water cylinder, turned off the
[1:28:05] gas and everything, came back. And
[1:28:06] Christine said to um said to him, "No,
[1:28:09] we had hot we we had hot showers
[1:28:11] yesterday, Sunday morning." He said, "I
[1:28:13] can't believe you. I physically
[1:28:15] disconnected this thing. This it's
[1:28:17] physically impossible for you to have
[1:28:19] hot water yesterday. The pilot lights
[1:28:21] turned off. The gas is turned off. The
[1:28:23] water's disconnected from the house. You
[1:28:24] can't do it." She said, "Well, we did."
[1:28:28] If God can give hot water,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; see this why you should speak faith
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; to each other. Don't even be conscious.
[1:28:35] WHAT? DON'T DON'T WORK OUT what to say,
[1:28:36] but say, "No, God can do it." That's
[1:28:38] right.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; God can do it. Amen. So, if God can give
[1:28:41] us hot water just out of a desire, how
[1:28:44] much more God giving us our loved ones,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; our family, our health, what whatever
[1:28:50] need, whatever burden we're carrying, I
[1:28:51] believe we're living in a season cuz
[1:28:53] God, we have rallied around the gift of
[1:28:55] the Holy Ghost in this day, God has
[1:28:57] given us grace to do it. Amen. God can
[1:28:59] give us whatsoever we ask for.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:29:05] Amen. And and again I say unto you, if
[1:29:07] two of you shall agree on earth as
[1:29:09] touching anything, just say anything.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Anything that they shall ask, it shall
[1:29:15] be done for them of my father which is
[1:29:17] in heaven. That's why it's so important
[1:29:19] when you pray agree with someone not
[1:29:22] just near in your heart. Yes, Lord, it
[1:29:24] can be done. Amen. He says concerning
[1:29:26] anything, I will do it. There's power
[1:29:29] and power in two coming together. That's
[1:29:32] why you got to create an environment in
[1:29:34] your home where we love the Lord. We
[1:29:37] believe his word. We're not here to talk
[1:29:38] about negative things and people and
[1:29:40] carnal stuff. We're here to talk about
[1:29:41] promises and what God can do. And you'll
[1:29:44] see him step in and do incredible
[1:29:46] things. Amen. And and and in that day
[1:29:49] you shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily
[1:29:51] I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask
[1:29:52] in the the Father in my name, he shall
[1:29:54] give it you. Here unto have you asked
[1:29:57] nothing in my name. Ask and you shall
[1:29:58] receive that your joy may be full. Who
[1:30:02] wants full joy?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; This is a season of tidings of great
[1:30:05] joy. Why not be one where it's the joy
[1:30:07] of God you answered prayer? God, you've
[1:30:10] thrown me into expectation because
[1:30:11] you've quickened to my heart your word.
[1:30:14] Amen. Lord, the promise is on its way.
[1:30:16] So, I I'm I'm full of joy. I'm not full
[1:30:18] of doubt and worry and guessing it's
[1:30:20] going to happen. I've got an
[1:30:20] expectation, Lord. You can do it.
[1:30:24] And then we'll finish just with this
[1:30:25] again. Now unto him that is able to do
[1:30:28] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:30:30] can ask or think according to the power
[1:30:33] that workketh in us. Unto him be glory
[1:30:35] in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:30:37] all ages, world without end. Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He can do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:30:43] all. Are you under expectation that
[1:30:46] divine love can conquer everything?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Do you know it can?
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Well, let him live in this day. May this
[1:30:54] Let's just have the musicians this
[1:30:55] morning. It's going to finish there, but
[1:30:57] let this Christmas season and let as we
[1:30:59] go into 2026,
[1:31:01] may it be a year and a time, this this
[1:31:04] great gift he gave us would live like
[1:31:07] never before that the power of God would
[1:31:10] be so real in our lives that his word
[1:31:12] that he would throw us into such an
[1:31:14] expectation like Simeon, you're going to
[1:31:16] see the longing of your heart's going to
[1:31:18] be manifested in this time. what you've
[1:31:22] been wanting to see because no doubt
[1:31:23] because he is a devout man. He was
[1:31:25] looking for the Messiah. He wanted it.
[1:31:27] But then God actually was so gracious to
[1:31:29] him. You're going to see him before you
[1:31:30] die. I mean, I believe we're like Simeon
[1:31:33] or Anna, the blind prophetist in the
[1:31:35] temple that came by that way as well.
[1:31:36] God led her there. Amen. But God is
[1:31:38] God's grace is so great upon us that he
[1:31:41] will give us the desires of our heart.
[1:31:44] Because the desires of our heart is not
[1:31:45] a fancy car. It's not heaps of money.
[1:31:47] It's not those kind of things. It is the
[1:31:50] salvation of our house. Amen. So
[1:31:52] actively believe. You believe for your
[1:31:54] own salvation. Now let God use that same
[1:31:56] faith to apply to everyone around you.
[1:31:58] And you watch them step into that
[1:32:00] anointing and God will break the yoke of
[1:32:02] the enemy and set them free. I believe
[1:32:04] it. Amen. Why? Cuz we can we can we can
[1:32:08] we can rejoice. Imagine the feeling he
[1:32:11] had as he picked up Jesus in his arms.
[1:32:13] Lord, you promised it. Now he's here.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many times has God
[1:32:20] fulfilled his word, thrown us into
[1:32:21] expectation? [music] It's yours. I'm
[1:32:24] going to give it to you. Then you
[1:32:25] embrace the promise. You see it in its
[1:32:27] fulfillment. God hasn't stopped doing
[1:32:29] that, friends. [music] This message is
[1:32:31] alive. So may you have a very blessed
[1:32:35] merry Christmas. May be may he be the
[1:32:38] great gift as we give gifts to one
[1:32:40] another. But maybe he be the g great
[1:32:42] gift you rally around in your house. You
[1:32:45] celebrate with your families, your loved
[1:32:46] ones. you travel, wherever you're going,
[1:32:48] may the great gift of eternal life,
[1:32:49] Jesus Christ our Lord, be number one in
[1:32:52] your heart. Amen. Let's stand, shall we?
[1:32:58] [music] Amen. What are we singing?
[1:33:00] Sorry.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; My chain's [music] gone. Okay.
[1:33:07] His mercy reigns.
[1:33:12] Unending love.
[1:33:15] Amazing grace.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amazing
[1:33:23] grace.
[1:33:24] How sweet the sound
[1:33:28] that saved
