[0:00] foreign
[0:28] thank you
[0:56] everyone
[0:58] welcome to the house of God
[1:02] um let's um
[1:03] let's just start this morning by
[1:05] inviting the Lord to be here
[1:07] and
[1:08] to ensure that we
[1:10] um
[1:13] that something is achieved
[1:15] because we
[1:16] we many people meet a lot of times in
[1:20] groups all over the world
[1:22] all the time but
[1:24] meeting with the Lord is very different
[1:25] and
[1:27] and that's really what we want to be
[1:29] doing this morning is meeting with the
[1:31] Lord
[1:32] and to have him change us and mold us
[1:34] and make us encourage us strengthen us
[1:38] and
[1:40] that we could become more like him so
[1:42] let's just um come up this time of
[1:45] worship to the Lord this morning and the
[1:46] word and everything that would happen
[1:47] here Heavenly Father we're happy once
[1:49] again that we can come into your house
[1:52] and that that we've dedicated this place
[1:55] set it at the side for you and we meet
[1:58] here at the certain time lord just for
[2:00] our human Logistics it all works to meet
[2:02] here at this time Lord but
[2:04] we've put all these mechanics in to have
[2:07] everything ready and to to do it all a
[2:09] certain way Lord but the the main thing
[2:12] Lord is that you would come in our midst
[2:14] Lord and bring the Dynamics bring the
[2:17] the life to this whole operation Lord if
[2:20] we if we just meet without you lord it's
[2:22] all in vain Lord we we know the
[2:26] scripture Lord that even if we labor
[2:27] Lord if you're not involved in it then
[2:29] then we we labor and vain those of us
[2:31] that build Lord but we desire that you
[2:34] would come here this morning and amidst
[2:36] the Lord that you would
[2:37] fill this place fill our hearts Lord May
[2:39] our minds be a tentative to you this
[2:41] morning may our thoughts be upon you
[2:43] Lord as we've got this another wonderful
[2:45] opportunity to meet with you and to be
[2:47] with Brethren of the same Faith as as
[2:52] um the Bible calls it light precious
[2:54] faith or to maybe look through us with
[2:57] our spiritual lives this morning Lord
[2:59] look through the eyes of faith Lord and
[3:01] not look at natural things but look at
[3:03] spiritual things this morning that you
[3:04] could work in our spiritual life Lord
[3:06] too
[3:09] and encourage us and regardless
[3:11] revelation
[3:13] Lord and just to strengthen and
[3:16] encourage us we know each one here we're
[3:18] all going through different Journeys
[3:19] upon our walk and and we all need
[3:21] different things Lord but we've seen
[3:23] that you're
[3:25] hand and you work in in such a way Lord
[3:27] that you can achieve a whole lot of
[3:29] different things in one service and and
[3:31] cater for each person and Lord May our
[3:34] expectation be that Lord that that that
[3:37] we wouldn't come here and desire what we
[3:39] think we want but we would lay ourselves
[3:41] on your altar Lord and say Lord whatever
[3:43] you want for us this morning that's what
[3:44] that's what we want Lord even though we
[3:46] may not know what it is so I just want
[3:48] to commit the service to your hands
[3:49] bless those that couldn't make it this
[3:50] morning blessed brother Andy as he's
[3:52] ministering and
[3:53] um Stratford this morning Lord may you
[3:55] anoint him and Inspire him May the
[3:58] Saints there have a good time
[4:00] and you Lord may you may you meet with
[4:02] them in a powerful way
[4:04] Lord of May forgive us of every sin
[4:06] we've committed Lord that Wicked and
[4:08] we're so thankful for your the sacrifice
[4:10] of Calvary that was made for us we're so
[4:13] grateful Lord for the the ways that
[4:15] you've that you have accommodated for
[4:17] fallen man Lord even even a simple thing
[4:19] like sleep Lord we can lay down and
[4:22] sleep and wake up and have another day
[4:23] Lord I believe you ordain that because
[4:25] you knew that the way that man is Lord
[4:28] we we just our minds aren't very good
[4:31] and we just struggle away Lord but
[4:32] you've given us this opportunity to
[4:34] sleep and wake and to serve you again
[4:35] and the same in our spiritual life Lord
[4:38] You've granted us forgiveness and we're
[4:39] so grateful we want to lay hold upon
[4:41] eternal life this morning Lord that your
[4:43] spirit could we could last let every
[4:45] weight that easily besets us Lord and
[4:47] just just
[4:48] um
[4:49] just dwell in the heavenlies this
[4:51] morning
[4:52] so just commit the service to you we
[4:54] thank you for your grace and mercy
[4:55] towards us pray your blessed Sunday
[4:57] school and bless each each one here this
[4:59] morning we just commit ourselves to you
[5:00] in Jesus name amen amen amen I was
[5:04] thinking about sleeping that's such an
[5:05] awesome thing to to the human being
[5:07] imagine if we didn't sleep
[5:10] imagine if we our minds just kept on
[5:12] going and going and going and didn't
[5:13] have a chance to stop
[5:16] shut down and wake back up again
[5:18] it's such an awesome thing that God's
[5:20] God's given us sleep
[5:22] and and to have a peaceful sleep is so
[5:24] good
[5:26] I don't know why I'm talking about it
[5:27] but I just was thinking about it that it
[5:30] that it has to be of God you know that
[5:32] that he's made the mind that we can
[5:34] sleep and we can wake up and we can
[5:35] carry on and if we sort of just switch
[5:37] off
[5:39] you know there's no sleep in hell they
[5:41] don't get peace yeah
[5:43] there's no sleep
[5:45] but to be able to rest and have peace
[5:47] that's of God he's the Prince of Peace
[5:49] amen
[5:51] I didn't get much sleep I'm not talking
[5:52] about it
[5:57] now let's stand this thing this morning
[5:59] uh number one two five I will enter his
[6:01] gates with Thanksgiving in my heart
[6:04] be thankful for all that he's done for
[6:06] us I'll enter his course with praise
[6:08] when we stop and think about it the
[6:09] Lord's done so much for us so much amen
[6:13] sometimes he just builds and builds and
[6:14] we we just
[6:16] can Overlook what he's doing but he's
[6:18] doing Mighty things in our lives and in
[6:19] our midst amen I will enter

[27:25] morning I've just been so so blessed
[27:27] this week you know and um
[27:29] uh sometimes um you know
[27:33] I was standing then I thought ah you
[27:35] know I I I the Holy Spirit has been sort
[27:38] of just pressing on your heart and
[27:40] um and then I said no I'm not going to
[27:42] do it I'm not going to do it and last
[27:44] week I was um testifying to a brother
[27:48] um and his wife and I was just telling
[27:51] them that um
[27:52] uh over the years I've learned that um
[27:57] sometimes God has a work for you it's
[28:00] sometimes very small and if you don't do
[28:03] what it tells you to do there's a price
[28:05] you sometimes pay for it you know so I
[28:07] was standing there and I and the Holy
[28:09] Spirit just kept on tagging at my heart
[28:10] it give the test that when you give the
[28:13] testimony
[28:14] and you know so I trust it will just be
[28:17] a blessing to you this morning
[28:19] um
[28:20] somehow you know the Lord is just
[28:23] uh really blessed us while we were in
[28:26] New Zealand time
[28:27] so it's it's it's it's it's just
[28:30] wonderful I just I just um
[28:33] before the the pastor comes up you know
[28:36] um
[28:37] if you can open your Bibles for me in
[28:39] the Book of Revelations 18
[28:41] and it's just so wonderful you know it's
[28:44] just um
[28:48] just thinking about how to load is by
[28:50] his grace and mercy and where he has
[28:52] brought me from just the trophy of his
[28:54] grace just a trophy of his Mercy you
[28:56] know and um
[28:58] just seeing the the hour that we at the
[29:01] lateness of the hour the solemnness of
[29:03] the hour
[29:04] and some time back I actually went on to
[29:07] a site
[29:08] and I read a portion of it one morning
[29:11] here
[29:12] and there was a problem with my computer
[29:14] and I didn't get the full part of it
[29:18] and I just read a proportion of it one
[29:21] morning of brother Branham in the Ramada
[29:23] Inn and so on and during the time you
[29:26] know just carrying on with life and just
[29:28] you know dedicating yourself and um
[29:31] uh I was just wondering I was just
[29:33] thinking you know that um Jesus speaks
[29:36] of of
[29:37] fasting and praying
[29:41] um and brother Branham himself speaks of
[29:43] fasting and praying
[29:45] and
[29:48] there was a there was a time there was a
[29:49] season
[29:50] that
[29:53] um
[29:54] in the message of the hour that people
[29:56] felt that since
[29:58] since we are all predestinated
[30:01] it is fine you don't don't don't don't
[30:04] spiritualize things if if the sister had
[30:07] an experience and she's very happy and
[30:09] I'm she's telling us uh she's just
[30:12] spiritualizing that experience you know
[30:14] the Brotherhood and experience he had
[30:16] something so something bad happened and
[30:18] then something somebody learned from it
[30:20] or somebody somebody comes in the and
[30:23] they repent
[30:24] and um or somebody has an experience
[30:27] that for us singly is negative
[30:30] and then the person comes and say oh no
[30:33] no you know now I'm you know through
[30:34] this I'm drawn closer to God and we
[30:36] people sometimes would say yeah you're
[30:38] just spiritualizing you experience you
[30:40] you should have stayed with God all the
[30:41] time
[30:42] and um
[30:54] the the pastor where I served
[30:57] where we served back in South Africa a
[31:00] few years back
[31:02] um they lost their daughter and um
[31:05] uh yeah she was very young
[31:07] and
[31:11] during the week
[31:13] people were just encouraging them I
[31:15] think it's 10 years since he's passed on
[31:18] and she was a real blessing she's a very
[31:20] soft voice very nice person very nice
[31:22] humble character
[31:24] and it was quite surprised that God
[31:26] would take her at that young and tender
[31:29] age that she had I mean I think her
[31:30] youngest boy was just two years old and
[31:33] it was like a shock 444 for people that
[31:35] how could God take her you know and it
[31:37] was like mysterious I would just see she
[31:39] ended up in hospital and
[31:41] um just through a particular medicine
[31:43] and I think the disease that she
[31:45] contracted or the sickness was Steven
[31:47] Johnson disease
[31:48] and it's amazing how God works that
[31:54] you you wonder
[31:56] why these things happen in your life why
[31:58] certain things happen in your life so
[32:00] you might be sitting there and you're
[32:02] wondering why a thing happened and then
[32:04] you you may say that I'm not going to
[32:07] spiritualize this thing I'm not going to
[32:09] make too much of it it's just something
[32:10] natural
[32:11] and and then I was just wondering about
[32:15] why Jesus would say that don't let
[32:17] people know when you're fasting and when
[32:19] you are praying
[32:21] Jesus himself
[32:23] the Bible says he learned obedience by
[32:26] the things that he suffered
[32:29] brother Branham comes along
[32:31] born under the polar of fire under a
[32:34] slight
[32:35] having an angel guiding him through his
[32:37] life and then you would say that I I
[32:41] would I would pray and and fast for for
[32:44] this one and people who come to brother
[32:46] Branham with problems and brother
[32:48] Brennan would go and he would fast for
[32:51] days for that person's merits to be
[32:53] saved or that person to be healed
[32:55] and I was wondering well I'm in the
[32:57] message of the hour I'm elected I'm
[32:59] going to heaven and you know it's
[33:01] amazing that that if Jesus had to
[33:04] sanctify himself
[33:06] if if Jesus had to sanctify and inset
[33:10] aside
[33:11] brother brainer made to do it and I was
[33:13] wondering
[33:14] why why why you know and in the week
[33:18] when I saw all the encouragement to the
[33:21] the brother that has lost his wife which
[33:22] was the the pastor's son-in-law and also
[33:25] all the encouragement to eat to her
[33:27] brother obviously now I'll pass the Sun
[33:30] um
[33:31] and somehow I was I was reading my new
[33:33] ministry and I was really just enjoying
[33:35] the sermon and and then somehow I ended
[33:38] up where they going where the sermon is
[33:41] actually finished and they singing and
[33:42] they're praying let us pray and so so
[33:45] normally when you come to that side
[33:46] brother the brainer must finish
[33:47] preaching them because he's praying in
[33:49] his altar call or whatever
[33:51] and I I hear the book and I was
[33:53] rejoicing and I made my notes like
[33:55] normal and one morning I'm sitting in
[33:57] the train I think it is in the week
[34:00] and because sometimes I read quite a lot
[34:02] of different spoken words at the same
[34:03] time and I went back to this one and I
[34:06] found this lost portion in the last page
[34:10] that's after everything is done so it
[34:12] goes like this I just want to read it to
[34:14] you
[34:15] that you might know
[34:17] that Sovereign Grace reigns with God
[34:21] now he's done everything already he's
[34:22] done he's done the fitted service is
[34:24] finished he's done everything it's gone
[34:26] through everything so the song the
[34:28] praying now he says I want to go back
[34:32] I I just can't yell from placing
[34:35] something else in
[34:37] did you know those two boys
[34:40] that humans children that were saved God
[34:44] knew that before the foundation of the
[34:47] world and their names were actually put
[34:50] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[34:53] foundation of the world the Bible says
[34:56] that
[34:57] and it only had to work to this minute
[35:01] so obviously you know we're talking of
[35:03] society right a spoken word because you
[35:06] know those that read will read the
[35:07] sermon my new ministry will know we'll
[35:09] see what brother random did in there
[35:11] did you know God knew
[35:15] now now he's saying God knew that those
[35:17] two boys would be saved before the
[35:18] foundation of the world
[35:21] but it only had to work to this minute
[35:24] you know God knew that we would be
[35:26] standing here 10 million years before
[35:30] the world was ever founded
[35:32] you know he knew we'd be staying here
[35:35] this morning the Infinity of God knowed
[35:39] every fly every net every time they
[35:42] would bear the eyes and how much Tallow
[35:45] they would produce if before the world
[35:48] was ever formed God knew it now you say
[35:52] well if he knows it then why are you
[35:56] preaching
[35:57] so this is Brother Branham asking the
[35:59] question
[36:00] that's God it's part of God's program
[36:05] preaching is his program when he looked
[36:09] upon the apostles he looked upon the
[36:11] Harvest he said the Harvest is arrived
[36:14] in the laborers are few
[36:16] pray the Lord of harvest that he will
[36:19] send laborers into his Harvest how many
[36:22] remember that well why would they have
[36:26] to pray to the Lord of harvest to send
[36:28] laborers into the Harvest if the Lord of
[36:31] harvest was standing there knowing it
[36:34] would be done why was it so arranged now
[36:38] listen to this this is what brother
[36:40] Branham is saying so
[36:42] I actually quoted this very quote that
[36:44] I'm reading now
[36:46] also in the week to somebody else a
[36:48] sister
[36:49] it was in fact the very people that say
[36:52] the message with me how I came in the
[36:53] message of the hour they were in the
[36:55] message they followed the message and it
[36:56] was their parents basically I I'm I met
[36:59] I met him when he was in in I think it's
[37:01] a year four or five year in New Zealand
[37:03] but it's back in South Africa we call it
[37:05] standard senatory or it's our year it's
[37:08] our grade five in South Africa and I
[37:12] would go into this brother's house I'll
[37:14] be I actually became friends with with
[37:16] the boy at school and this is the sister
[37:18] little years later once he got married
[37:20] so I'd go to the house
[37:22] and I saw for the very first time the
[37:24] pillar of fire in their house
[37:26] and I quoted this very next quote to her
[37:29] because he's now divorced from her
[37:30] husband things happen in life things
[37:32] happen that's quite bad in life later on
[37:35] with her life
[37:36] and now she was saying something and and
[37:38] I didn't know what to say when I saw how
[37:40] the people were trying to encourage her
[37:42] and I quoted this now listen to this
[37:47] God has so arranged it
[37:51] that this program cannot move without
[37:54] you and I
[37:57] and as long as we're not doing what God
[38:00] leads us to do we are paralyzing his
[38:03] program
[38:04] but when the church moves by the
[38:08] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are
[38:11] in God's will doing his program oh as
[38:15] soon as I return from California the
[38:17] Lord willing sonar is telling them you
[38:20] know God needs you and I his program
[38:21] cannot run without you and I and then
[38:25] the next spot brother Branham has this
[38:29] urgency this was Priest November 15
[38:31] 1959. so brother Branham says I'm going
[38:34] now to California and you know what
[38:36] happened in California or also
[38:38] Revelation 18 just now when he preached
[38:40] that Series in California but he says as
[38:42] soon as I'm coming back look at the
[38:44] urgency on brother Branham
[38:47] when I come back the Lord willing what
[38:50] the Branham Tabernacle needs is a
[38:52] Revival now it's night he's been
[38:54] preaching for so many years
[38:57] when I come back then amen they need a
[39:01] Revival in the filling of the Holy Ghost
[39:03] now that's the great need of the
[39:05] Tabernacle some of the finest people in
[39:09] the world come here but what they need
[39:11] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I feel
[39:14] it I can tell it as soon as we return
[39:17] back the Lord willing we're going to
[39:19] have a Revival for that very purpose
[39:23] that the members of the Tabernacle were
[39:27] people he says here were seeking the
[39:29] Holy Ghost might come in receive
[39:32] instruction in everything else pray
[39:35] meetings in here to receive the holy
[39:37] ghost that the thirds might get back
[39:40] into the will of God and move on with
[39:43] the program of God as it moves on
[39:46] so so so brother Branham did not take it
[39:49] for granted that there's going to be the
[39:51] elected
[39:53] that oh that one will be elected brother
[39:55] Branham sincerely would preach and pray
[39:58] and and preach and talk to people on the
[40:01] streets because he realized he is part
[40:04] of the program of God and God needs his
[40:07] program
[40:08] cannot run without he says here can his
[40:11] program cannot move without you and I
[40:14] and I say to the sister
[40:16] that God needs you to be a light in
[40:21] darkness
[40:22] we are all in the light he doesn't need
[40:24] us here here we can Rejoice but he
[40:26] actually needs me somewhere in a dark
[40:29] place where there's sinners in whatever
[40:30] he needs you somewhere with his darkness
[40:32] and and I I just realized but by God's
[40:35] grace and mercy you know what God has
[40:38] given us
[40:40] what God has given us is given us
[40:42] actually the best and and understanding
[40:44] here is a trophy of his gracious brother
[40:46] Branham says in the Hebrew series
[40:47] speaking of rosella sees a product of
[40:51] Grace you know we are all just a product
[40:53] of God's grace and this morning
[40:56] you know I'm really happy just just pray
[40:58] for me and my family you know the
[41:00] daughter is about ill this morning and
[41:03] just while I'm closing with this
[41:07] um in the in the Revelation series
[41:08] chapter 18. I just want to read this you
[41:10] know just um
[41:12] we yesterday I had such a lot of plans
[41:14] yesterday
[41:15] and somehow the wife and I we sat down
[41:19] and we started
[41:21] um this this
[41:23] um site that I was on where I only found
[41:25] the one part and I managed to get my
[41:27] computer fixed in and yesterday morning
[41:29] I think it was around about five I went
[41:31] on and I was doing some stuff and then
[41:33] next thing I found the whole the home of
[41:35] the of the of the of the link actually I
[41:37] could get onto the whole link and it was
[41:39] about
[41:41] um a man called Zoe Joe brand I don't
[41:44] know if you've ever heard of inzo brand
[41:46] in 1937 he was 17 years old and he had a
[41:50] dream and he dreamed about the
[41:52] destruction of Los Angeles and he gave a
[41:55] very detailed account pages and Pages
[41:57] full and they put it in in a book
[42:00] earthquakes earthquakes by prophecy and
[42:04] they put it in a book and in this pretty
[42:05] book they actually dedicated one full
[42:07] chapter to brother Branham as well and
[42:10] how brother Brandon made it it was just
[42:11] so striking so we we sat down at the
[42:13] table yesterday and we just had such a
[42:15] blessing so all my work was done because
[42:18] when we were done uh you know the
[42:21] anointing came down yesterday morning
[42:22] and we were fell asleep in the wife and
[42:24] iron and sitting and then it was four in
[42:26] the afternoon my Saturday was gone but I
[42:29] believe it was just so good list so you
[42:31] know we were just talking and my wife
[42:33] said she just had such a blessing this
[42:34] week she said she was listening to the
[42:36] sermon and the anointing dropped down
[42:38] and I know my wife she's not a emotional
[42:40] person and my wife was sharing a
[42:42] testimony with me and whilst he was
[42:44] setting a testimony even yesterday my
[42:46] wife started crying and she said the
[42:47] anointing just dropped down realizing
[42:49] the likeness of the hour you know and
[42:52] it's amazing if one sees the lateness of
[42:55] the hour if one sees where we are at
[42:58] um uh the earthquakes that's happening
[43:01] and the you know the things happening
[43:02] currently in Los Angeles
[43:04] um
[43:05] it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[43:06] amazing that that by God's grace and
[43:09] mercy we are still here and I was just
[43:12] reading last night Jesus said that
[43:13] accept he saw it in the days no flesh
[43:16] will be saved so so um it's really just
[43:19] for us it's the message Believers my
[43:21] wife was saying see see the anointing
[43:23] drop down when she when she echoed to
[43:26] God
[43:27] she's just so glad that that she's a
[43:31] part of the message of the hour she said
[43:33] then the anointing dropped down and I
[43:35] said to her I don't know if it was the
[43:37] same time but I was at work and I was
[43:40] just setting myself aside and you know
[43:42] you normally don't say these things but
[43:43] then you just sanctify yourself you just
[43:45] fast and you pray and you just you know
[43:47] and I said to I don't know if it was the
[43:49] same time but I'm sitting in front of my
[43:50] computer and working and I was listening
[43:53] to the seals while I'm working had my
[43:55] earphones on and I looked through the
[43:57] window and an anointing just pressed on
[44:00] me to go and pray and there's a little
[44:01] sick room that we have and I went in and
[44:03] I went to go pray
[44:04] and I'm also exactly the same thing I
[44:07] just went to say to the Lord thank you
[44:09] for sending me the message
[44:13] because
[44:15] upon the world
[44:17] destruction upon the world it's waiting
[44:21] the the judgments and the and the fire
[44:23] in the brimstone of God is hanging and
[44:26] we are family members we have loved ones
[44:29] that we have we are family of ours that
[44:31] we have that that we say Lord I can't
[44:34] save them you are the only one that can
[44:36] go and save them so so so and that is
[44:39] the earnestness and and the sincerity
[44:42] with which I think brother Branham then
[44:45] approach this so I just want to to read
[44:48] out of those Revelations 18 you know um
[44:53] verse 1 and after these things I saw
[44:57] another Angel come down from heaven
[44:59] having great power and the Earth was
[45:03] enlightened with his glory and he cried
[45:06] mightily with a strong voice saying
[45:09] Babylon the great is Fallen and it's
[45:13] become the habitation of devils and the
[45:16] hold of every false spirit in a cage of
[45:20] every unclean and hateful bird I'll just
[45:23] drop to 8 8 therefore sell her plagues
[45:27] come in one day
[45:28] death and mourning and famine and sea
[45:32] shall be utterly burned with fire for
[45:36] strong is the Lord God who judged her
[45:38] and the kings of the earth who have
[45:41] committed fornication
[45:43] he says here and delivered deliciously
[45:45] would a shall bewail her and lament for
[45:49] her when they shall see the smoke of a
[45:51] burning standing afar off for the fear
[45:55] of hurt torment saying Allah's Allah
[45:58] that great City Babylon that might that
[46:01] Mighty City for in one hour is thy
[46:04] judgment come verse 16 and saying
[46:07] Allah's Allah that great city that was
[46:10] clothed in fine linen and purple in
[46:13] scarlet and decked with gold and
[46:15] precious stones in poles for in one hour
[46:18] so great reads us he says here is come
[46:22] to note verse 19 and the cast dust of
[46:26] their heads and cried weeping and
[46:28] wailing those are those that saw the
[46:30] destruction of the city and they threw
[46:32] the dust on their faces on their heads
[46:34] weeping and wailing saying Allah's alas
[46:36] that great City wherein were made rich
[46:39] and all the had Subs in the sea by
[46:42] reason of a costliness for in one hour
[46:44] EC made desolate and while brother Perry
[46:48] green was sitting privately with brother
[46:50] Branham
[46:52] and that was after brother Branham
[46:54] preached about in this various places
[46:56] that brother Brandon preached about the
[46:58] destruction of Los Angeles
[47:00] and um
[47:02] let me read the next part because it
[47:04] refers to Los Angeles so this great City
[47:06] Babylon it says here verse 8 for will be
[47:10] utterly burnt with fire so the next one
[47:12] verse 20 Rejoice over her thou heaven
[47:17] and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets for
[47:20] God had Avenged you on her
[47:23] and a mighty Angel took up and a mighty
[47:27] Angel took up a stone like a great
[47:29] Millstone and cast it into the sea
[47:32] saying that's what violence saw that
[47:36] great City Babylon be thrown down and
[47:38] shall be found no more at all so while
[47:42] he was reading this so when he was
[47:44] speaking of Revelations 8 18 8-10 while
[47:48] he was reading when he finished when he
[47:50] came to verse 8 utterly burned with fire
[47:54] and in one hour is a Destruction come he
[47:57] says brother Branham just stopped while
[47:59] he was reading brother Ben and just
[48:01] interjected and brother Branham says
[48:03] it's Atomic power that will fall it's an
[48:06] atomic bomb that will fall on that City
[48:08] and the second part of it verse 20 to 21
[48:12] refers to another Babylon Two Babylons
[48:15] the first Babylon which is which is the
[48:17] one that will be destroyed by fire is
[48:19] Rome and brother Branham says in the
[48:22] second coming of Christ he he says I see
[48:24] that Russell has caught the the the the
[48:29] the it's already really the the the
[48:31] muscle is there already and it's got his
[48:33] name written on USA in Rome and um
[48:37] when brother Branham had a Visions in
[48:40] 1933
[48:41] when he related the visits for the very
[48:43] first time he had a conjugation to stand
[48:46] up in the church and he had a
[48:48] congregation to repeat a number of times
[48:50] what's Russell what's Russell the King
[48:53] of the North what's Russell what's
[48:55] Russell the king of the Lord and he had
[48:57] a congregation repeating there the whole
[48:58] time
[49:00] and um
[49:02] he interjected there and he said
[49:04] one hour that's Atomic power where the
[49:07] Vatican City will just be destroyed the
[49:09] second Babylon is the one where a
[49:12] millstone and you have read we have all
[49:14] read it when brother Branham came and he
[49:16] threw up in the and brother Reno had to
[49:18] take up the stone the angel said to him
[49:20] pick up a stone and he threw it in the
[49:22] air and he dropped and that caused a
[49:24] whirlwind and it turned to the brother
[49:26] and he said you see you have to do
[49:29] something for things to happen
[49:32] you have to do something for things to
[49:35] happen so if if if if if you want to
[49:38] have somebody saved you have to do
[49:40] something if you want to have healing
[49:42] you have to do something uh no matter
[49:44] what it is fast pray say Lord whatever
[49:47] but you have to do something you had to
[49:49] pick up the stone to get Revelations 20
[49:52] 18 20 together one is a Vatican that
[49:55] will be destroyed the other one is is
[49:57] that City Los Angeles and and and and
[50:00] brothers and sisters just my prayer this
[50:03] morning just an encouragement
[50:05] um you know that
[50:07] it's a it's a very late hour
[50:09] it's a very late time for us you know um
[50:13] uh I I'm just so glad that um you know
[50:16] God has kept me
[50:18] for all these years and when I read the
[50:21] account of the dream and it's it's quite
[50:23] funny when he when he saved the dream
[50:25] they went to go do research on it
[50:28] and to find out if these things can
[50:30] actually happen and the way it describes
[50:32] the dream it's the it's the account in
[50:35] which brother Branham speaks of this
[50:36] role you know and it gives the dream in
[50:39] very detailed account what will happen a
[50:41] lady Hawking with a little child in the
[50:43] road and in this dream he's thinking he
[50:46] can touch to tell her the destruction is
[50:48] coming he's trying to touch somebody he
[50:49] realizes he's he's actually he says
[50:52] destruction is coming he says and the
[50:54] people were caring and he was talking of
[50:56] Indus dream night he saw the men in the
[50:58] street wearing earrings and they had
[51:00] beard and stuff like that and and he
[51:03] said when he he said when he woke up
[51:05] because it was in a few days that the
[51:07] Dream came to him every time or more he
[51:09] said it will never happen people will
[51:11] never wear earrings 1937. he said in
[51:13] this dream if you really account
[51:16] it will never happen
[51:18] and he said then he saw how the like the
[51:21] woman in the city was dressed immorally
[51:23] dressed and the reason of brother
[51:24] Branham I think it's the third or fourth
[51:26] vision of fifth one of their first year
[51:28] and then it went and then what Branham
[51:30] says when they went for that vote after
[51:32] they went and they protested the first
[51:34] person they were all modestly dressed
[51:36] long skirts neat and they protested for
[51:39] the human vote and he says the vision
[51:41] sold him when they came back after
[51:43] winning the vote he said their dresses
[51:45] became sorted and so the Angels told him
[51:47] how they went and it went up and then
[51:49] they started becoming Immortal after
[51:51] they won that vote so so you know it's
[51:54] it's amazing weekend just thank the Lord
[51:56] for for sending us a profit I'm really
[51:59] just so happy
[52:01] um apologies that I'm taking up such a
[52:02] lot of time
[52:03] um you know I'm really just so happy
[52:05] that that God has sent us a prophet
[52:08] um you know it's it's it's it's it's
[52:09] most probably worth more than anything
[52:11] you can have it's more than money you
[52:13] can lose your arm you can lose your eye
[52:15] you can lose your leg you can lose
[52:17] whatever you have you know
[52:19] um you can lose whatever and and and and
[52:21] and and but this is worth much more than
[52:24] gold that you know it's amazing that
[52:27] brother Branham at another place that I
[52:29] was reading
[52:30] that brother Branham says when he went
[52:32] to the Vatican he says there's not
[52:34] enough money in the world to buy that
[52:38] City and God comes with an atomic bomb
[52:40] and destroys it in one hour
[52:42] that means my house my car my gold my
[52:45] what's my whatever I have it's nothing
[52:47] brother Branham never attached any value
[52:50] to it you know brother Brandon I told my
[52:53] wife well he pulls testimony when they
[52:55] came in they asked brother Paul what was
[52:57] outstanding of brother Branham what was
[52:59] outstanding of your dad he said
[53:02] dad was a poor man
[53:07] he was a poor man he turned out Millions
[53:09] he prayed for monarching kings and they
[53:11] wanted to pay him and he turned it down
[53:14] and one place brother Billy Paul said
[53:16] dad came to preach and he kept his arm
[53:18] on the hand and he just kept praying
[53:20] preaching like this because there was a
[53:21] hole in the jacket he preached always in
[53:23] borrowed clothing clothing that people
[53:25] gave him that I said to my wife this was
[53:28] the prophet of God the one they created
[53:30] in heaven and earth
[53:32] so so I then I realized you know that he
[53:35] knew because this world he says when the
[53:37] angel told him turn look look again when
[53:39] he looked he saw America burned up
[53:41] that's great place that everybody wants
[53:43] to be American with the cars and stuff
[53:45] he said when he looked again the angel
[53:46] in the seven Vision when the angel said
[53:48] to him look and he turned
[53:50] and he saw America's desolate it's
[53:53] burning so you know the only thing that
[53:55] we have is actually the message of the
[53:57] hour it's worth more than anything the
[53:59] the it's worth more than our jobs it's
[54:02] worth more than our houses it's worth
[54:03] more than anything so you know by God's
[54:06] creation by God's mercy
[54:08] um you know it's it's been it's really a
[54:10] blessing to be here this morning and I
[54:12] translate we will just um ansonize the
[54:15] word this morning our hearts will be
[54:17] will be so so in in you know in tune
[54:19] with with the pastor's preaching that we
[54:22] will lay ever aside every weight I think
[54:24] the brother said it earlier lay aside
[54:25] every weight that so easily besets us
[54:28] let us not make time yesterday I was
[54:30] cleaning the garage I was just throwing
[54:32] away this digest and stuff because I
[54:34] used to it I said I don't have time now
[54:35] anymore for any other reading this
[54:37] they're always too late so just pray
[54:40] that God would make me more dedicated to
[54:43] the word you know set aside every way
[54:45] that's so easy to be set us
[54:47] um you know and yeah it's been a
[54:49] blessing to you know just to realize
[54:51] what God has done for us seeing the hour
[54:53] the lateness that we are in so I'll be
[54:56] taking my seat I trust that you've been
[54:57] blessed this morning seeing this just
[55:00] anxanize the word just appreciate a
[55:02] little bit and as brother Branham said
[55:04] in that quote it's all part of the
[55:06] program of God the negative things
[55:08] happening it's because God needs you and
[55:11] me so that we can do something so that
[55:13] we can go and pray for that person
[55:15] that's sick there's a problem that comes
[55:16] in our house before the foundation of
[55:18] the world 10 million years President
[55:20] says before the world was formed he knew
[55:23] about this thing he knew that those boys
[55:25] would be saved you know you knew about
[55:27] your problem but we have to dedicate
[55:29] ourselves so I think that's just all
[55:30] that the lord has laid on my heart this
[55:32] morning just to say what is third this
[55:34] morning that the likeness of the hour
[55:35] pray for me as we will continue to pray

[1:00:28] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[1:00:32] Satan has desired to have you
[1:00:34] that he may
[1:00:36] um sift you
[1:00:39] he may sift you as wheat but I have

[1:00:43] thee that thy faith fail not and when
[1:00:45] thou art converted strengthen thy
[1:00:47] brethren
[1:00:49] now I've got a job chapter one
[1:00:52] notice notice uh Satan's desire and then
[1:00:55] notice God's desire
[1:00:58] in that scripture
[1:01:01] then we'll go now it's very familiar
[1:01:04] portion of scripture to everyone here
[1:01:06] but
[1:01:06] we'll just read verses six down to 12.
[1:01:11] and says and there was a day when the
[1:01:13] sons of God came to present themselves
[1:01:15] before the Lord and Satan came also
[1:01:17] among them and the Lord said unto Satan
[1:01:20] whence cometh thou then Satan answered
[1:01:22] the Lord and said from going to and fro
[1:01:24] in the earth and walking up and down in
[1:01:26] it and the Lord said unto Satan thou
[1:01:28] hast thou considered my servant job that
[1:01:31] there is none like him in the earth a
[1:01:33] perfect and an upright man he that
[1:01:35] feareth God and askureth Evil then Satan
[1:01:39] answered the Lord and said Duff and said
[1:01:41] doth job fear God for naught Hast not
[1:01:44] Thou made a hedge about him and about
[1:01:46] his house and about all that he hath on
[1:01:49] every site thou has blessed the work of
[1:01:51] his hands and his substance is increased
[1:01:54] in the land but put forth thine hand now
[1:01:56] and touch all that he hath and he and he
[1:01:59] will curse thee to thy face
[1:02:01] and the Lord said unto Satan behold all
[1:02:03] that he hath is in thy power
[1:02:06] only upon himself for not for thine hand
[1:02:09] so Satan went forth from the presence of
[1:02:12] the Lord amen let's just bow here's a
[1:02:14] word of prayer father We Want to Thank

[1:03:50] uh
[1:03:51] I want to entitle this if I can give it
[1:03:53] entail I say When God says no
[1:03:55] and sometimes when you think that people
[1:03:57] say well God say no to you but I want to
[1:03:59] say he know he says no to Satan
[1:04:01] now
[1:04:02] so when God when God and and Satan were
[1:04:05] having that conversation about job
[1:04:08] uh in a manner of words God said to
[1:04:11] Satan I don't believe you can do it in
[1:04:13] other words I don't believe you
[1:04:15] and brother Bram says us and then Jesus
[1:04:17] came and called he says and all things
[1:04:19] are possible to them that believe that's
[1:04:21] his word but impossibilities are made
[1:04:24] manifest when God has took it as word
[1:04:27] yes sir when God's took it as word The
[1:04:30] Impossibles are made manifest When God
[1:04:32] says it will be then you take the word
[1:04:35] and watch what the impossibilities
[1:04:37] happen it certainly will but notice even
[1:04:40] in all that she said even now Lord
[1:04:42] whatever you ask God God will do it so
[1:04:44] he's talking about when when when Jesus
[1:04:46] is going to uh lazarus's tomb speaking
[1:04:49] to Mary and Martha
[1:04:50] but she knew I mean so she knew that if
[1:04:53] she could just get the word to come from
[1:04:55] him that's all she needed to do is get
[1:04:58] that word yes it was her darkest hour
[1:05:00] and Jesus came along and called oh what
[1:05:03] a thing they saw a resurrection let's
[1:05:06] look at some more when Dark Hours come
[1:05:08] there was a man one night one time named
[1:05:11] job one of the oldest prophets in the
[1:05:13] bible he was a great man he loved the
[1:05:15] Lord he had done all he knowed how to do
[1:05:17] and Satan desired to sift him
[1:05:21] and he said to God one day yeah God said
[1:05:23] to him rather Where Have You Been Satan
[1:05:25] oh walking to and fro up and down on the
[1:05:28] earth he said have you considered my
[1:05:29] servant job there's no come on the earth
[1:05:31] he's a perfect man oh he said you give
[1:05:34] him everything do everything for him and
[1:05:36] certainly he's a great man but let me
[1:05:39] have him one time I'll change the tune
[1:05:41] I'll make him curse you to your face he
[1:05:43] said you can't do it that's his
[1:05:45] confidence in a Believer that's his
[1:05:47] confidence see you have confidence in
[1:05:49] God but God has to have confidence in
[1:05:50] you why he's infinite he's Eternal he
[1:05:53] knows the end from the beginning he
[1:05:55] knows Satan couldn't do it for he is the
[1:05:57] word he knowed what job would do now
[1:06:00] remember job he broke him out and Boyles
[1:06:03] killed his children took everything he
[1:06:04] had his health was gone even his
[1:06:06] comforters came and they couldn't do
[1:06:08] nothing but just accuse him of being a
[1:06:10] secret Sinner and old job got into such
[1:06:12] a place until he got so distressed you
[1:06:15] have to get in distress first you have
[1:06:18] to get to a time when you're at the end
[1:06:20] of the road job got into the end of the
[1:06:22] robe when he said curse be the day that
[1:06:25] I was born May the Sun not even shine
[1:06:27] and the moon not Shine by night May the
[1:06:30] name never be called and in that
[1:06:32] distressed and Jesus came along he
[1:06:34] looked down and said I see a flower die
[1:06:37] you know um it rise again in Spring if a
[1:06:40] tree blows down it comes up again
[1:06:42] through the scent of water he's seen all
[1:06:44] the botany life living again but he said
[1:06:46] a man lay it down gives up the ghost
[1:06:48] where is he he knowed he was an old man
[1:06:51] he said his sons shall come to mourn
[1:06:54] over him and he perceive it not oh that
[1:06:56] thou would hide me in their grave keep
[1:06:58] me in the secret place till thy wrath be
[1:06:59] passed a point me a time instead of time
[1:07:02] uh
[1:07:04] and he went along talking like that so
[1:07:07] Satan Satan was Desiring to sift job
[1:07:11] now
[1:07:13] Peter we understand as as Jesus was
[1:07:16] speaking there he said he said the Satan
[1:07:19] has desire to sift thee now the act of
[1:07:22] sifting maybe if we can have those
[1:07:24] slides and I'm I'm going to jump to and
[1:07:26] Fry just as the Lord leads but can we
[1:07:28] put those slides up and there's a
[1:07:29] picture because I want to show you yeah
[1:07:31] yeah put put put slide three up
[1:07:34] now this is this is what is called
[1:07:36] sifting sifting weight where the grain
[1:07:39] is separated from the chaff and this is
[1:07:41] part of the sifting process so sifting
[1:07:44] is to remove things you don't want you
[1:07:46] just want the pure grain and there's
[1:07:48] some ways to do it you know there's many
[1:07:49] ways you either sift it through a
[1:07:51] machine
[1:07:52] or these these women here are beating
[1:07:55] the uh beating the wheat against these
[1:07:57] drums to loosen up the uh pieces they
[1:08:00] don't want and then this guy is sifting
[1:08:02] it through a sieve so he's decided to
[1:08:04] sift in other words he's desired to
[1:08:06] remove you
[1:08:07] from from from the congregation of the
[1:08:10] Believers he says I had to take you away
[1:08:12] and throw you on the rubber sheep of
[1:08:14] life this is what Satan this is what God
[1:08:17] is you know Satan is telling you know
[1:08:19] Jesus is saying Satan has desired to
[1:08:22] sift him
[1:08:23] so in other words you're not going to be
[1:08:25] in the upper room you're not going to
[1:08:27] have the keys
[1:08:28] Jesus already given him the keys but now
[1:08:30] Satan's saying you're not going to use
[1:08:32] those keys I'm not going to allow you to
[1:08:35] unlock the Kingdom of Heaven to anyone
[1:08:37] this is what Satan was saying that Satan
[1:08:40] is desire to system that he could not do
[1:08:42] what God had ordained him to do but
[1:08:44] Jesus said but I have prayed thee
[1:08:47] I mean I have prayed for thee that when
[1:08:49] you know when this happens that thy
[1:08:52] faith failed not
[1:08:54] now
[1:08:56] we have to in life
[1:08:59] you know I just want to maybe just go
[1:09:01] over something from last week can we go
[1:09:02] to the first first slide now this now
[1:09:05] now I want you to remember Zion and I'm
[1:09:07] going to show you in the scripture I
[1:09:08] just mentioned it last week I just
[1:09:10] thought to just just repeat this bit
[1:09:11] because Zion is the bride and maybe
[1:09:14] let's just read that quickly let's go to
[1:09:15] the second second slide this is in
[1:09:18] Psalms 132 13 to 16. I just took one
[1:09:20] example for the Lord has chosen Zion he
[1:09:23] has desired it for his habitation this
[1:09:25] is my rest forever here will I dwell for
[1:09:28] I have desired it I will abundantly
[1:09:30] bless her provision I'll satisfy her
[1:09:32] poor with bread I'll also clothe her
[1:09:35] priest with salvation and her Saint
[1:09:37] shall shout aloud for Joy so Zion is not
[1:09:40] just a physical location but God is
[1:09:42] saying Zion is the bride Zion is his
[1:09:44] place of habitation and we know the
[1:09:46] human soul is where God dwells so he's
[1:09:49] saying that this is where I'm going to
[1:09:50] dwell and see I have desired he has
[1:09:53] designed it for his habitation remember
[1:09:54] Satan has desired to sift thee I mean so
[1:09:58] so there's so there's two there's only
[1:10:00] two powers on the earth there's not
[1:10:02] three or four or a whole congregation
[1:10:03] you know a whole group of array there's
[1:10:06] Satan's kingdom and there's God's
[1:10:08] kingdom that's the only two and one has
[1:10:10] a desire and the other has a desire and
[1:10:13] it's whoever you allow
[1:10:15] who you yield to their desire will be
[1:10:17] met in your life who you yield yourself
[1:10:21] to now let's go up to let's go up to the
[1:10:24] first can we go up now
[1:10:26] notice
[1:10:27] notice this is what God has this is what
[1:10:30] God has done for us remember when he's
[1:10:32] talking about Zion here
[1:10:33] because and and then we'll come down to
[1:10:35] next I'll show you he says thus saith
[1:10:37] the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and His
[1:10:38] Holy One to him whom he has despised to
[1:10:42] him whom the nation of Horus to a
[1:10:44] servant of rulers King shall arise a sea
[1:10:47] in her eyes princes also shall worship
[1:10:49] because of the Lord that is faithful and
[1:10:52] the Holy One of Israel and he shall
[1:10:54] choose thee thus saith the Lord in an
[1:10:57] acceptable time have I heard thee
[1:10:59] who's has he answered your prayers
[1:11:01] except for all time
[1:11:04] uh I've heard the
[1:11:06] and on the day of salvation have I
[1:11:08] helped thee
[1:11:09] think about it and I will preserve thee
[1:11:12] and keep thee for a covenant of the
[1:11:14] people to establish the Earth to to
[1:11:16] cause to inherit the desolate heritages
[1:11:18] that thou mayest say to the prisoners go
[1:11:21] forth to them that are in darkness show
[1:11:24] yourselves they shall feed in the ways
[1:11:26] and their passes shall be like in all
[1:11:28] high places they shall not hunger nor
[1:11:31] thirst neither shall the heat nor the
[1:11:33] son Smite them for he hath had mercy on
[1:11:36] them shall lead them even by the Springs
[1:11:38] of water shall he guide them he shall
[1:11:40] lead them to Springs of Living Water and
[1:11:43] I will make a mountain I'll make all my
[1:11:45] mountains away and my highway shall be
[1:11:47] exalted behold these shall come from
[1:11:50] afar and low these from the North or
[1:11:51] from the west and from the uh land of of
[1:11:55] of sinum uh seeing our Heavens be joyful
[1:11:58] o Earth Break Forth into singing o
[1:12:00] Mountains for the Lord has comforted his
[1:12:03] people and will have mercy upon his
[1:12:05] afflicted he's speaking of you
[1:12:08] in this in this whole chapter he's
[1:12:10] speaking of you but notice notice Zion's
[1:12:13] reply
[1:12:14] she doesn't say Zion does not say here
[1:12:17] yes Lord I have been fed I have been
[1:12:20] clothed I've been comforted I've been
[1:12:22] set free this is not her confession at
[1:12:24] this time her confession is but Zion
[1:12:27] said the Lord hath forsaken me and my
[1:12:31] God hath forgotten me
[1:12:33] okay can a woman forget a cycling child
[1:12:36] that she should not have compassion on
[1:12:38] the son of her womb yeah they may forget
[1:12:40] yet will I not forget thee behold I've
[1:12:43] Graven thee upon the palms of my hands
[1:12:45] thy walls are continually before me so
[1:12:48] God is saying something but then the
[1:12:50] bride in this in this particular sense
[1:12:52] is saying something very very completely
[1:12:55] different and the reason the only reason
[1:12:57] that Zion would say this is because she
[1:13:00] is not believing what God has done for
[1:13:01] her but she has accepted the devil's lie
[1:13:05] because the devil will say thou has been
[1:13:07] forsaken
[1:13:09] amen and thy Lord has forgotten me or is
[1:13:13] he only is it only me that he tells that
[1:13:15] to
[1:13:16] amen the Lord you know the Devil comes
[1:13:19] along and he says God doesn't love you
[1:13:21] he doesn't care for you he's not
[1:13:24] interested in you this is what God this
[1:13:25] is what the Devil comes along and says
[1:13:27] and if we're not careful we'll accept
[1:13:29] his life
[1:13:31] because you'll say look at what's
[1:13:33] happening in your life
[1:13:35] if God really loved you and he cared for
[1:13:37] you why did he allow these hardships why
[1:13:41] did he allow this sickness why did he
[1:13:43] allow just these it seems like you're
[1:13:45] just in a desert
[1:13:47] and you begin to reason it out and it
[1:13:50] appears so true
[1:13:52] but friends
[1:13:53] God's love is not like human love and
[1:13:56] we're going to go into that
[1:13:57] God's love is not like human love
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:02] so she's saying that she is forsaken
[1:14:06] but now
[1:14:07] there comes a time where the bride does
[1:14:09] not speak this way anymore
[1:14:11] but she begins to confess what he has
[1:14:13] said because we understand in
[1:14:15] Revelations chapter 12 that there's war
[1:14:17] in heaven Michael and his angels fought
[1:14:19] against the dragon and and forwarded his
[1:14:22] angels and the dragon and his angels
[1:14:23] didn't Prevail and that and that battle
[1:14:25] that was in heaven now kicked out of
[1:14:27] heaven and now they're upon the Earth
[1:14:29] and that same battle is now warring in
[1:14:32] human beings but then there comes a
[1:14:35] point where it said and they overcame
[1:14:36] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:14:38] word of their testimony and they love
[1:14:40] not their lives unto the death this is
[1:14:42] not this verse is not for Angels because
[1:14:44] no blood was shed for Angels Angel blood
[1:14:47] was shed for fallen man
[1:14:49] amen so there's a people upon the Earth
[1:14:51] that overcame the dragon and overcame
[1:14:54] Satan and all of his all of his workings
[1:14:56] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:14:58] their testimony what is what is a
[1:15:01] testimony a testimony is speaking things
[1:15:04] that happen to you
[1:15:06] amen and it's also confessing what he
[1:15:08] has said about you amen Our Testimony is
[1:15:11] not only God God has has delivered me
[1:15:14] but you begin to speak the same things
[1:15:16] that God has spoken
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:19] that is that is what we must do you want
[1:15:22] to overcome him I mean God has God has
[1:15:25] you know there's overcoming we must
[1:15:27] overcome you know we can just sit there
[1:15:30] like a bunch of Spectators and and say
[1:15:32] yes the Lord can do all things he can do
[1:15:34] all things but he has to work through
[1:15:35] human flesh his victory must be manifest
[1:15:38] in his people
[1:15:39] amen over every you know over everything
[1:15:42] and you see every generation there's
[1:15:44] Giants that must be killed amen David
[1:15:47] killed David killed Goliath and then and
[1:15:50] then that you know Goliath have brothers
[1:15:52] and there was also Sons there was like
[1:15:54] four other Giants that the Next
[1:15:56] Generation killed you go read in there
[1:15:58] the next Generation killed these Giants
[1:16:00] so there's Giants and brother Bram says
[1:16:03] the first sermon he preaches after he's
[1:16:05] commissioned by the angel to take the
[1:16:07] gift of healing to the world as he

[1:18:23] amen and they're excited about it

[1:19:10] just just enjoy him
[1:19:12] just enjoy him you should I trust when
[1:19:14] you come or when you open your Bible
[1:19:16] listen to a message it should be a real
[1:19:18] burden in your soul I don't want to
[1:19:20] leave this way the same amen
[1:19:22] when I pray God changed my mind changed
[1:19:25] me I want to I don't want to just talk
[1:19:27] to the ceiling remember he hears every
[1:19:29] prayer so we don't go off on how
[1:19:31] anointed we may feel I felt As Dead As
[1:19:33] opposed and prayed for things and God's
[1:19:35] just done it
[1:19:37] Faith goes beyond feelings but don't
[1:19:39] just get all the other devil he you know
[1:19:41] he loves to say well
[1:19:43] you're tired
[1:19:44] you're and and then he says well because
[1:19:46] you're tired because it shows you're not
[1:19:48] interested
[1:19:50] hey man he usually he just used it all
[1:19:52] again you are you just
[1:19:53] you don't really love the Lord because
[1:19:55] look if you really loved him you would
[1:19:57] act a certain way
[1:19:59] amen and he uses your own personality
[1:20:01] against you
[1:20:03] friends
[1:20:05] just tell him to shut up
[1:20:07] you mean about Zion
[1:20:09] sheep it was actually quoting the
[1:20:11] devil's word here
[1:20:13] the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has
[1:20:16] forgotten me all these verses we read
[1:20:18] before this it didn't sound like a
[1:20:20] forsaken woman did it
[1:20:22] no she's the apple you're the apple of
[1:20:25] his eye
[1:20:26] Hallelujah
[1:20:28] now
[1:20:31] I want to talk about
[1:20:33] if I may have just wanted to put that in
[1:20:35] there but I want to talk about God's
[1:20:37] elective love
[1:20:40] because
[1:20:41] we think see Zion she had a confession
[1:20:45] the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has
[1:20:47] forgotten me because our love is
[1:20:50] different to God's love
[1:20:51] it's it's vastly different
[1:20:54] because we we think well we love our
[1:20:56] children so we try to protect them and
[1:20:58] we feed them and we clothe them and we
[1:21:00] you know we don't want them to be heard
[1:21:02] in any way physically or emotionally
[1:21:06] but God's love you may say this is quite
[1:21:08] different but God's love is not like
[1:21:10] that
[1:21:11] God's love is not like that
[1:21:14] now this is from
[1:21:16] can we can we can we jump next one yeah
[1:21:19] here it's from the church age book now
[1:21:24] I just want to read this it says from
[1:21:26] the Samoan Church age now the Lord
[1:21:28] Almighty says I know there he is walking
[1:21:31] in the midst of his people there he is
[1:21:33] the chief Shepherd of the flock but does
[1:21:36] he hold back the persecution does he
[1:21:39] stem the tribulation no he does not he
[1:21:42] simply says I know your tribulation I am
[1:21:45] not unmindful of your suffering what a
[1:21:48] stumbling block that says to so many
[1:21:50] people
[1:21:51] amen because this is not how human
[1:21:54] people think this is not how you know
[1:21:56] this is not what we think like Israel
[1:21:58] they wonder if God really loves them how
[1:22:01] can God be just and loving if he stands
[1:22:04] by and watches as people suffer that is
[1:22:07] what they asked in Malachi 1 verses one
[1:22:09] to three the burden of the word O Lord
[1:22:12] to Israel by Malachi I have loved you
[1:22:14] saith the Lord yet you say run has thou
[1:22:17] loved us
[1:22:20] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[1:22:23] Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau
[1:22:25] and laid his mountains and his Heritage
[1:22:28] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:22:30] now whenever this and then we're gonna
[1:22:33] go we're gonna go into Romans and read
[1:22:34] the scripture where where Paul expounds
[1:22:36] upon it whenever people's mind when you
[1:22:40] read the scripture before they are even
[1:22:42] born Jacob have I love but he so have I
[1:22:45] hated man automatically thinks that's
[1:22:47] not fair
[1:22:48] depends what side of the fence you put
[1:22:50] yourself on
[1:22:51] amen I say I say that is fair God is
[1:22:54] Sovereign in his choosing it's not a
[1:22:56] democracy remember God God has
[1:22:59] orchestrated salvation in such a way it
[1:23:02] takes any part of it takes away anything
[1:23:04] you can do
[1:23:06] amen remember he put something in you to
[1:23:09] respond to his word in the beginning and
[1:23:11] faith is a revelation has to be revealed
[1:23:13] to you you can't give yourself a
[1:23:15] revelation it takes God to come down
[1:23:18] sure you should read the word you got to
[1:23:20] give you got to give God something to
[1:23:22] work with absolutely but it takes God to
[1:23:25] Anchor it from here down into here it
[1:23:27] takes God sovereignly to Quicken
[1:23:29] something
[1:23:30] amen so faith is a revelation
[1:23:33] you cannot and you see that in
[1:23:35] uh you know Jesus said to Peter Upon
[1:23:38] This Rock the revelation of who I am
[1:23:40] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:23:42] Hell shall not Prevail against it so
[1:23:45] Faith yeah because some people you know
[1:23:48] a lot of people
[1:23:50] they say if you do this step and do this
[1:23:52] step and do this step you have eternal
[1:23:53] life
[1:23:55] not necessarily you have to follow God
[1:23:57] has a provided way
[1:23:59] auntie in at the Straight Gate
[1:24:01] s-t-r-a-i-t that's a water a water gate
[1:24:04] entry and be baptized name of Lord Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ for the remission of sin so
[1:24:09] there's a way you must walk
[1:24:11] but if it's just a mechanical way
[1:24:14] amen without God quickening it
[1:24:17] then that's as far as a lot of people go
[1:24:20] remember
[1:24:21] human human understanding there's a
[1:24:24] massive Chasm between our understanding
[1:24:25] and divine revelation
[1:24:27] they're totally poles apart
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:32] amen but you have to give something for
[1:24:33] God to work with you say I'm just going
[1:24:36] to sit here by myself you know there's a
[1:24:38] cartoon I think I saw on Facebook uh you
[1:24:41] know yo there's a cartoon guys praying
[1:24:42] Lord I wanna I Wanna Know Your Will and
[1:24:45] there's a big hand through the cloud
[1:24:46] saying here it is
[1:24:48] with a Bible in its hand here's my will
[1:24:51] you know and some people just expect
[1:24:54] they'll just sit in a room somewhere in
[1:24:55] a big thunder lightning time will happen
[1:24:57] God has sent his word
[1:25:00] amen God sent he sent his final voice to
[1:25:03] the to the Earth he sent Malachi for
[1:25:06] hey man he sent these things so we can
[1:25:09] hear those things and then something
[1:25:10] else says that's true and it confirms
[1:25:13] with what we hear
[1:25:14] you say well I'm just I just need God to
[1:25:17] I need to God to show me read it it's in
[1:25:20] here
[1:25:22] amen so God you know
[1:25:24] but it has to be Revelation is sovereign
[1:25:29] election is sovereign
[1:25:31] amen now I trust after this service
[1:25:33] don't just cabbage down and say oh well
[1:25:36] I'm predestinated everything will be
[1:25:37] fine you know to me when I was when I
[1:25:39] was reading into this I'll say thank God
[1:25:42] amen that God has chosen me and the
[1:25:45] reason I'm loved is because I'm elected
[1:25:46] it's not on self-worth or what I do or
[1:25:49] how good I think I am you know you take
[1:25:52] you take Jacob you take Esau no one
[1:25:55] would have picked Jacob Jacob means
[1:25:57] supplanter no one would have put Jacob
[1:26:00] as as receiving the birthright for for
[1:26:03] one he was born seconds that canceled
[1:26:05] him out completely you know he was a
[1:26:07] little mama's boy he sat down and he was
[1:26:09] with her in the tent and and Isaac loved
[1:26:13] he saw more than Jacob heals a prophet
[1:26:15] who loved the wrong one more
[1:26:17] I mean because he was the good church
[1:26:19] member he did what his daddy wanted him
[1:26:22] to do he went hunting and got him
[1:26:23] Venison and did all these things he
[1:26:25] appeared to be the real believer
[1:26:27] but deep down no
[1:26:30] no one would have picked Jacob no one
[1:26:32] would have picked the woman at the well
[1:26:33] think of Rahab no one would have picked
[1:26:36] Rahab for now a lineage of Kings is
[1:26:38] going to come to Israel and I'm going to
[1:26:40] use this woman
[1:26:42] no one would have picked Ruth think of
[1:26:44] it no one would have booked these people
[1:26:46] but God elected them to that position
[1:26:49] and because God you know God elected
[1:26:52] them therefore he loved them
[1:26:53] no one would have no one would have
[1:26:55] picked them you just think you go back
[1:26:56] into that day
[1:26:58] no one would have picked these people
[1:27:01] not you would not have picked them I
[1:27:04] guarantee if we had a vote who do you
[1:27:06] think will marry Solomon you know he's
[1:27:08] you know remember he was royalty in the
[1:27:10] house of you know Jude he's a general in
[1:27:13] the Army if we had a poll in the church
[1:27:15] there just let's just go back there
[1:27:17] let's have a you know a poll who thinks
[1:27:20] that who's gonna marry salmon
[1:27:23] you would have picked some Royal
[1:27:26] Israelite woman
[1:27:28] you would never have picked up a
[1:27:30] prostitute who's a gentile you never
[1:27:32] would have picked it
[1:27:35] amen no
[1:27:38] I I could be honest you would never have
[1:27:40] picked yourself
[1:27:42] you never would have picked yourself
[1:27:43] you're no doubt many of us when we were
[1:27:45] growing up people would say I just need
[1:27:46] to pray for that boy
[1:27:48] there's no way he's ever going to amount
[1:27:49] to anything when it comes to the Lord
[1:27:51] but God Made You amen he elected you
[1:27:55] because there's something in you that
[1:27:57] when the word came your way you said I
[1:27:59] want it
[1:28:00] I want you God
[1:28:02] Hallelujah something and you said that's
[1:28:04] me Jacob wanted the birthright above
[1:28:07] everything
[1:28:08] and he is willing to even deny himself
[1:28:11] you mean how did he deny himself he put
[1:28:13] it you know put he he made himself
[1:28:15] appear like his brother he denied
[1:28:16] himself I'm not Jacob
[1:28:18] he denied himself and he received the
[1:28:20] birthright
[1:28:22] Hello friends you're going to deny
[1:28:24] yourself
[1:28:25] Hallelujah but he wanted he wanted the
[1:28:27] birthright and he cheated everyone out
[1:28:29] of everything
[1:28:31] till finally God gave him a nature
[1:28:33] change
[1:28:34] amen that that really resembled the
[1:28:36] birthright that he had received
[1:28:38] Hallelujah no one would have picked me
[1:28:41] Hallelujah this is why God's election is
[1:28:43] so beautiful
[1:28:44] Hallelujah
[1:28:46] that's meant now
[1:28:48] sorry where am I here
[1:28:52] you
[1:28:54] could you see they could not figure out
[1:28:57] God's love see remember the Devil comes
[1:28:59] along the first thing he says is God
[1:29:01] doesn't care he doesn't love you
[1:29:04] mother just say I'll just say and the
[1:29:06] church said amen
[1:29:08] I mean that's the first thing he does
[1:29:09] you see they could not figure out God's
[1:29:12] love they thought that love meant no
[1:29:14] suffering
[1:29:16] that's what and that people still think
[1:29:18] that people think if you really love
[1:29:20] then people won't suffer
[1:29:23] Hallelujah they thought that love meant
[1:29:26] a baby with parental care but God said
[1:29:28] his love was elected love his love was
[1:29:31] elected love the proof of his love is
[1:29:34] election no matter what happened his
[1:29:37] love was proven truly by the fact they
[1:29:39] were chosen unto salvation
[1:29:42] because God has chosen you to Salvation
[1:29:45] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:29:47] belief of the truth he may commit you to
[1:29:50] death
[1:29:51] where we are you've gone to the second
[1:29:52] one
[1:29:53] uh he may commit you to death
[1:29:57] as as he did Paul he may commit you to
[1:30:00] suffering as a good job that is his
[1:30:02] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[1:30:05] all with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:30:07] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:30:09] frustration and not of Peace his purpose
[1:30:12] is that after we have suffered a while
[1:30:14] we shall be made perfect be established
[1:30:18] strengthened and settled
[1:30:20] amen repeat after me I'm gonna be I'll
[1:30:23] be made perfect I've been established
[1:30:26] I've been strengthened I've been settled
[1:30:28] Hallelujah as as job said he put
[1:30:31] strength in US
[1:30:32] job 23 6 you see her see himself
[1:30:35] suffered he learned obedience by things
[1:30:37] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[1:30:39] by the things that he suffered
[1:30:42] amen so he's saying God's love
[1:30:45] um hold on with that one God's love is
[1:30:48] so different
[1:30:49] how do you know I'm loved because I've
[1:30:51] been called
[1:30:53] I mean how do I know I've been elected
[1:30:55] because I've been called and not just
[1:30:57] called as in a big call but something in
[1:31:01] you says that's me
[1:31:03] and so therefore I've been chosen
[1:31:07] just remember the service whatever you
[1:31:08] do doesn't matter what what what storms
[1:31:11] may come you know what battles may and
[1:31:14] you may think why is my life always like
[1:31:16] this God has it for a purpose and if
[1:31:18] there was no purpose he'd be the author
[1:31:20] of frustration and not of Peace you
[1:31:22] remember this and so how do you know
[1:31:25] because you know the devil says God
[1:31:27] doesn't really love you because he's
[1:31:28] trying to put this hole he knows what
[1:31:30] human love is
[1:31:31] and he's perverted it to the eighth
[1:31:33] degree
[1:31:34] but he comes along to you says God does
[1:31:36] not love you and I can say I'm sorry
[1:31:38] Satan I've heard this the bright I so
[1:31:41] moved last night when I thought about
[1:31:43] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:31:45] through this brother Brown says the
[1:31:46] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:31:48] this and it is exactly what happened
[1:31:50] amen that God sent a voice upon the
[1:31:52] Earth to call an elected an elected lady
[1:31:57] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[1:32:00] amen that God has called me I'm not just
[1:32:03] trying to preach you happy friends I'm
[1:32:04] trying to try to Anchor it in your soul
[1:32:06] if God has called you you're elected and
[1:32:09] if you're elected you're loved by God
[1:32:10] and you're never out of his care
[1:32:13] Hallelujah never out of his care
[1:32:16] hey man just think about it
[1:32:18] Hallelujah now it's meant now let's go
[1:32:20] to the next one this is the lady sitting
[1:32:21] Church age it's as many as I love I
[1:32:23] rebuke
[1:32:24] and Chase and be jealous therefore and
[1:32:26] repent
[1:32:27] uh so Revelation 3 19. this is the same
[1:32:30] message that John had as he cried out
[1:32:32] and that religious Wilderness of
[1:32:34] Pharisees Sadia season Heathen repent
[1:32:36] there was no other course then there is
[1:32:38] no other course now there is no other
[1:32:41] way to get back to God then and there is
[1:32:43] no other way now it is repent change
[1:32:45] your mind turn around repent for why
[1:32:48] will you die let us examine the first
[1:32:50] phrase as many as I love and the Greek
[1:32:53] the emphasis is upon the personal
[1:32:54] pronoun I
[1:32:56] he does not say as many would feel he
[1:32:59] should say as many as love me no sir we
[1:33:03] must never try to make Jesus the object
[1:33:05] of human love in this verse no
[1:33:08] it is the many that are the loved ones
[1:33:11] of God
[1:33:13] hello
[1:33:15] Hallelujah it is his love and question
[1:33:18] not ours
[1:33:19] remember if he if we disbelief
[1:33:23] oh I probably can't even find it but he
[1:33:25] says he says he remaineth faithful for
[1:33:28] he cannot deny himself the scripture
[1:33:30] tells us he cannot deny himself you say
[1:33:33] well what does that mean he cannot deny
[1:33:35] himself Eve was part of Adam
[1:33:38] Eve came out of Adam and before the fall
[1:33:40] she was called Adam
[1:33:42] she didn't even have a name because they
[1:33:44] were you saw two bodies upon the Earth
[1:33:46] but but Adam knew this is part of me
[1:33:48] this is not a different person this is a
[1:33:50] part of me and so Adam could not deny
[1:33:53] himself so he couldn't let Eve be burned
[1:33:56] as she deserved to be burned but he took
[1:33:58] the fall apart himself because he did
[1:34:00] not he could not deny part of himself he
[1:34:03] couldn't lose a part of himself he had a
[1:34:05] lot more Roots but he had no more
[1:34:07] feminist part of himself
[1:34:09] I mean he had because of love because he
[1:34:11] didn't want to lose a pot imagine
[1:34:13] imagine being married 60 odd years and
[1:34:16] you lose your spouse that's why so many
[1:34:18] you know it doesn't matter if the
[1:34:19] husband or the wife goes first nine
[1:34:21] times out of ten the next one goes very
[1:34:23] quickly
[1:34:24] because there's part of because they
[1:34:26] realize there's part of me missing this
[1:34:28] world could never be the same because
[1:34:30] I've lost a part of me and then they got
[1:34:31] to be where wherever they are and Adam
[1:34:35] was not willing
[1:34:37] he he knew he could not lose Eve
[1:34:41] and that's why God remaineth Faithful
[1:34:43] now that's just the shadow what about
[1:34:45] the reality
[1:34:46] amen that's why he remaineth faithful
[1:34:48] because he cannot deny himself he cannot
[1:34:51] deny you
[1:34:53] amen he cannot deny his bride because
[1:34:56] she's part of him
[1:34:58] Hallelujah
[1:35:00] now
[1:35:02] even
[1:35:04] his purpose sorry
[1:35:06] uh it is the many that are the loved
[1:35:08] ones of God it is his love and question
[1:35:10] not ours so once again we find ourselves
[1:35:14] glorying in his salvation I say
[1:35:17] hallelujah his purpose and his plan and
[1:35:19] we are confirmed
[1:35:21] even more strongly in the truth of the
[1:35:23] doctrine of the sovereignty of God even
[1:35:26] as it says in Romans 9 13 and we'll go
[1:35:29] and read it soon Jacob have I loved
[1:35:31] uh does it now uh does it now obtain
[1:35:35] that since he loved me only the many is
[1:35:39] he therefore in the state of complacency
[1:35:41] awaiting the love of those who are not
[1:35:44] drawn line to him by no means is this
[1:35:47] over he declared it also in Romans 9 13.
[1:35:50] he saw have I loved I'm sorry Esau have
[1:35:53] I hated and in verse 11 the spirit
[1:35:56] boldly calls out for the children not
[1:35:59] being born neither having done any good
[1:36:01] or evil that the purpose of God
[1:36:04] according to election might stand not
[1:36:06] not of works but of him that calleth
[1:36:09] this love is elective love it is his
[1:36:12] love for his elect and his love for them
[1:36:15] is apart from Human Merit
[1:36:17] Holly that's why I put that in bonus
[1:36:19] it's apart from Human Merit for it says
[1:36:22] that the purpose of God stands an
[1:36:23] election which is exactly the opposite
[1:36:26] to works or any man or anything that man
[1:36:29] has in himself
[1:36:31] Hallelujah because before the children
[1:36:33] were born he had already said Jacob have
[1:36:36] I loved but Esau have I hated
[1:36:39] and he now says to his own as many as I
[1:36:42] love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke us
[1:36:44] to approve to approve is to expose with
[1:36:47] a view of Correction Jason does not mean
[1:36:49] to punish it means to discipline because
[1:36:51] the subject's amendment is in mind
[1:36:55] Hallelujah see God God knows
[1:36:59] God knows what we that must go through
[1:37:01] but remember the whole underpinning
[1:37:04] thing
[1:37:05] doesn't matter if all gives way I
[1:37:07] trusted his anger in your soul I've been
[1:37:09] elected
[1:37:10] I've been called therefore I am loved
[1:37:14] Jesus loves me this I know and and will
[1:37:17] say it at the end
[1:37:18] for the Bible tells me so the Bible
[1:37:21] tells me I'm elected before the
[1:37:23] foundation of the world I was I was
[1:37:25] chosen
[1:37:26] Hallelujah
[1:37:28] hey man so we see here friends it's not
[1:37:31] just our human Merit and maybe I've
[1:37:34] probably said this many times I trust
[1:37:35] maybe it just sinks in our human Merit
[1:37:38] has nothing to do with salvation
[1:37:40] our our intelligence where we're born
[1:37:42] what race we are how good we are how
[1:37:45] rich we are how poor we are it has
[1:37:47] nothing to do how much you think you
[1:37:49] know of this it means nothing
[1:37:51] you actually have nothing zero you can
[1:37:53] bring to the table
[1:37:55] you have nothing you can bring to the
[1:37:56] table well that you say well that really
[1:37:58] leaves me in Dire Straits you know well
[1:38:00] no to me it puts the responsibility onto
[1:38:03] him
[1:38:04] amen you say then you go say Lord I
[1:38:06] can't do it you must save me God you
[1:38:08] must have lived me from this problem you
[1:38:10] must set me free
[1:38:12] because he's waiting for you to call out
[1:38:14] to him
[1:38:15] Hallelujah I can't overcome this of
[1:38:17] course you can't overcome it amen
[1:38:19] without the spirit of God operating in
[1:38:21] your life you can never overcome
[1:38:23] anything
[1:38:24] Hallelujah and that's why God is so good
[1:38:28] I mean because we can just depend upon
[1:38:30] him and that's why now when brother
[1:38:32] Brahms is about applying the token to
[1:38:34] your family he says you believed for
[1:38:36] yourself apply that same Faith to them
[1:38:39] probably that's why I say God call my
[1:38:42] children call the young people I mean
[1:38:45] call the open you know to me young
[1:38:46] people it's not an age thing some
[1:38:48] Churches put the young people down I
[1:38:50] lift them up I'm proud of our young
[1:38:52] people amen their their brothers and
[1:38:54] sisters like we're brothers and sisters
[1:38:56] amen God is for you young people God is
[1:38:59] for you old people how do you know I'm
[1:39:01] called this something drawing me from in
[1:39:03] here Amen in spite of what I want in
[1:39:05] spite of what I wanted to do
[1:39:07] something in here was stronger than my
[1:39:09] own desire Hallelujah surrender to that
[1:39:12] pool just surrender to the pool friends
[1:39:14] Hallelujah that's all you need to do God
[1:39:17] will God has already taken care of
[1:39:18] everything
[1:39:20] Holy says walk he says walk before me
[1:39:22] and be thou perfect that's why he gave a
[1:39:25] perfect sacrifice to make a perfect
[1:39:26] people that you can be perfect
[1:39:28] Hallelujah that's what he's done
[1:39:31] oh I can't live the word of course you
[1:39:33] can't live this message no one can live
[1:39:35] the message all it makes is long hair
[1:39:37] long dresses long faces amen but if you
[1:39:40] surrender to God he comes and lives a
[1:39:42] message out of you Hallelujah and he
[1:39:44] lives his word out of you friends
[1:39:46] that's all we need that's all we need
[1:39:48] Hallelujah
[1:39:49] hey man oh I want to see Jesus in me
[1:39:52] Just Surrender
[1:39:54] every day say Lord hey we're failures he
[1:39:56] knew remember that quota you're from the
[1:39:58] last book of life I believe it was he
[1:40:00] says God doesn't operate his business in
[1:40:02] a haphazard way
[1:40:04] God operates his business perfect so if
[1:40:07] he say if he's called you who's been
[1:40:09] called must say yes God I've been called
[1:40:13] if you've been called he's not going to
[1:40:14] lose you the next day he's not you
[1:40:17] cannot frustrate you can grieve the Holy
[1:40:19] Ghost but he's not going to unsave you
[1:40:23] no names can be taken off the Lamb's
[1:40:25] Book
[1:40:26] no names can be the book of life is a
[1:40:29] different part of the book but the
[1:40:31] Lamb's Book of Life is God's elected
[1:40:34] group and and our names have been put
[1:40:36] how do you know your name that's why
[1:40:37] that's why I put it down to and there's
[1:40:39] a deep calling
[1:40:41] that goes beyond how happy you feel how
[1:40:43] saved you feel how lost you feel how
[1:40:45] whatever you feel about God if there's
[1:40:47] something in here says I want more of
[1:40:49] Jesus that means your name's on the book
[1:40:51] that means your name's written in heaven
[1:40:53] on the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah
[1:40:58] the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:41:02] Satan can remember don't let Satan try
[1:41:05] you to confess like Zion said I'm
[1:41:07] destitute my God's forsaken me
[1:41:10] because the devil tries he he tries it
[1:41:13] he tries it all the time you've had a
[1:41:15] hard week you're tired look at all this
[1:41:17] you know pause it all down on you
[1:41:20] don't confess what he said I'd say Satan
[1:41:23] they overcame him by they overcame you I
[1:41:26] overcame you by the blood of the lamb
[1:41:27] and the word of my testimony I believe
[1:41:29] what my husband has said about me
[1:41:31] Hallelujah I just confess his word
[1:41:33] confess it till you believe it
[1:41:36] amen confess it to you believe it
[1:41:39] friends we're called to believe all
[1:41:40] things are possible
[1:41:42] I'd rather I'd rather die in faith
[1:41:45] and never see the Promise fulfilled then
[1:41:47] say no God can't do it God can do it
[1:41:50] we've had such a we have such a record
[1:41:53] I mean if you took this all the way down
[1:41:55] to now
[1:41:56] we've had such a record of God living
[1:41:59] and God calling people and God
[1:42:01] delivering God answering prayer
[1:42:04] Hallelujah you know the word of God
[1:42:08] I was thinking about this brother Armand
[1:42:09] was sharing with me you young people who
[1:42:12] are here was it last Saturday
[1:42:14] he was talking about Parables too wasn't
[1:42:16] he
[1:42:17] he's talking about parables
[1:42:19] yeah last thing he's talking about
[1:42:21] parables
[1:42:22] he didn't speak to me what he this is
[1:42:25] not okay he never spoke to me what he
[1:42:28] spoke to you and then I stand up here
[1:42:30] not on my notes and we're going to talk
[1:42:31] about parables what is that
[1:42:34] God operating on both ends
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] just just okay who has had God you've
[1:42:42] been talking to someone
[1:42:44] and then Sunday or wherever you let's do
[1:42:46] a service and God has just confirmed or
[1:42:48] spoken put your hands up young people
[1:42:50] have a look
[1:42:51] have a look
[1:42:53] and God does it more than once
[1:42:55] because Elisha knew what the king of
[1:42:58] Syria was thinking in his bed chamber it
[1:43:01] was a spirit of God in him that knew
[1:43:02] those things and that same God is
[1:43:05] present here and I'm not just talking
[1:43:06] about this building the bride around the
[1:43:08] world
[1:43:09] Hallelujah because our God is a
[1:43:11] dissolver of doubts like like Daniel
[1:43:14] said
[1:43:16] it's all part of God operating
[1:43:19] amen he never said a single thing to me
[1:43:21] about parables
[1:43:23] Hallelujah
[1:43:25] but that's God
[1:43:27] and why would he do that because God is
[1:43:29] trying to get your attention that he
[1:43:30] loves you that God is interested in you
[1:43:33] see Satan says he doesn't care God
[1:43:35] doesn't care he does care take the
[1:43:37] opposite of what the devil tells you how
[1:43:39] do you know the devil speaking he's
[1:43:40] trying just see where it leads you does
[1:43:43] it lead you closer to God or away from
[1:43:45] God if it's away from God that's the
[1:43:46] devil if it's closer to the closer to
[1:43:49] the Lord that is God speaking
[1:43:52] Hallelujah
[1:43:54] now
[1:43:55] we want to go to let's go to Romans
[1:43:57] chapter nine I want to read this
[1:43:59] let's read this together
[1:44:02] Hallelujah
[1:44:05] God's love is elective
[1:44:08] Hallelujah
[1:44:13] I'm happy friends
[1:44:14] Hallelujah
[1:44:16] Hallelujah I'm glad he chose me I didn't
[1:44:19] Jesus said you have not chosen me I have
[1:44:21] chosen you that's what he said I've
[1:44:23] chosen you and then remember Satan has
[1:44:26] desired to sift you
[1:44:28] he's desired to sift you amen but Jesus
[1:44:31] remember Jesus prayed Jesus prayed for
[1:44:33] you amen he said he actually praise you
[1:44:36] go read it in John he says he says
[1:44:39] father that you would not take them from
[1:44:41] the world but keep them in this world
[1:44:43] amen and he prayed that that you would
[1:44:47] be as he and the father are one so you
[1:44:49] and the father would be he prayed for
[1:44:51] you oh no one's ever prayed for me Jesus
[1:44:53] prayed for you Hallelujah who else would
[1:44:56] you want to pray for you
[1:44:58] he must go to the top Hallelujah
[1:45:01] amen and he's already done it
[1:45:04] that remember that is God's remember
[1:45:05] what is God's desire for my life that
[1:45:08] you would become one with him as the
[1:45:10] father and him are one that perfect
[1:45:12] union that is his desire and that not
[1:45:14] you'd be taken from the world but you'd
[1:45:16] be kept in this world that is remember
[1:45:18] Satan has desired to sift you
[1:45:21] but Jesus desire is very different
[1:45:24] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:45:27] Romans chapter 9.
[1:45:30] and verse 10 we're just going to read
[1:45:31] what he quoted in the church age book
[1:45:34] oh down to verse 18 and not only this
[1:45:36] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[1:45:40] one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[1:45:43] children being not yet born
[1:45:46] neither having any good or evil I mean
[1:45:49] never neither having done any good or
[1:45:51] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:45:53] to election might stand not of works but
[1:45:57] of him that calleth
[1:45:59] Hallelujah and it will set unto her the
[1:46:02] Elder Shall Serve the younger and it is
[1:46:05] written Jacob have I loved but he saw
[1:46:07] have I hated what shall we say then is
[1:46:10] there unrighteousness with God should we
[1:46:13] say that is not fear basically God
[1:46:15] forbid for he saith the Moses I will
[1:46:17] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[1:46:21] I'll have compassion on whom I will have
[1:46:23] compassion so then it is not him that
[1:46:25] willeth or him that runeth
[1:46:28] but God but of God that shows Mercy
[1:46:31] that's that's the important thing has
[1:46:33] God showed Mercy to you
[1:46:35] as God showed Mercy that's all that
[1:46:37] matters
[1:46:38] Hallelujah for the scripture saith unto
[1:46:41] Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I
[1:46:43] raised thee up that I might show my
[1:46:46] power in thee and that my name might be
[1:46:49] declared throughout all the Earth
[1:46:50] therefore hath he had mercy on whom he
[1:46:53] will have mercy and whom he will and
[1:46:56] whom he will he hardeneth it's up to God
[1:47:00] amen you say well that's not fair I say
[1:47:03] it is fear because it's not a democracy
[1:47:07] it's not a God is Sovereign he says I've
[1:47:09] picked this one
[1:47:11] and I've chosen this one and I've
[1:47:13] rejected this one not on their Merit but
[1:47:15] before they even born God made the
[1:47:17] choice you're just living out God's
[1:47:19] choice
[1:47:20] you're living out God's choice you say
[1:47:23] well I I chose him that he chose you
[1:47:26] first remember in order there to be a
[1:47:28] deep in here there must be a deep
[1:47:30] calling first there's a deep there
[1:47:32] before there's a deep in here so he's
[1:47:34] showing that God's election he says I
[1:47:36] will have so to have mercy is that not
[1:47:38] love to have compassion is that not love
[1:47:42] so God's saying I will have compassion
[1:47:43] and mercy on whom I will
[1:47:46] and I can say I'm just a recipient of
[1:47:49] that mercy and that compassion
[1:47:50] Hallelujah
[1:47:52] so it doesn't matter
[1:47:54] you know God just looks down
[1:47:57] and this is not remember I said it's not
[1:47:59] on a person's ability or anything they
[1:48:02] could do but God just looks down
[1:48:04] and he says I'm going to bless them
[1:48:06] that's it
[1:48:07] that's what God has declared there's
[1:48:09] certain people I'm just going to bless
[1:48:11] them
[1:48:12] and that's it I'm just I'm just gonna
[1:48:14] bless them now many times we think of
[1:48:17] blessings as a material thing
[1:48:20] but no that is not that do not use that
[1:48:23] as your measuring stick remember the
[1:48:25] devil says look your your finances are
[1:48:27] ruin and this is all going wrong and
[1:48:30] he's Jehovah Jireh why isn't he
[1:48:31] providing for you
[1:48:34] oh he doesn't care that's why
[1:48:36] no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:48:38] don't go down that road remember Satan
[1:48:41] if he can if he can get you to think
[1:48:44] that God doesn't love you
[1:48:46] that's normally the biggest thing does
[1:48:48] God love me
[1:48:49] does he care I'm telling you absolutely
[1:48:52] he loves you and he cares I mean because
[1:48:54] if we if we measure God's uh you know
[1:48:58] because we want to be pleasing to him
[1:49:00] don't we we want to play Above All
[1:49:02] Things
[1:49:03] Our Father in heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:49:06] name thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:49:07] in other words have your way in Me O God
[1:49:10] I want to be I want everything I do I
[1:49:12] want to be pleasing unto you
[1:49:14] not to try and earn anything but because
[1:49:17] you love him
[1:49:19] so then we think now
[1:49:21] because out of our sincerity if things
[1:49:23] go wrong the devil says well you don't
[1:49:26] really please him and that's why this is
[1:49:28] happening
[1:49:29] oh no
[1:49:30] but this is so don't let that become a
[1:49:32] measuring stick don't measure God being
[1:49:35] pleased with you
[1:49:37] so many times okay so there's just me so
[1:49:39] many times we think of being blessed as
[1:49:41] in material things don't use that as
[1:49:43] your measuring stick and don't measure
[1:49:45] God being pleased with you uh because
[1:49:48] everything is going well in life either
[1:49:52] God being placed as a respective members
[1:49:56] remember I said he just I'm just going
[1:49:57] to bless this one I've Loved Jacob I've
[1:50:00] hated Esau that's it before they even
[1:50:03] born so he just looks at the people and
[1:50:04] says I'm just going to bless those
[1:50:06] people that's it nothing can reverse my
[1:50:09] blessing
[1:50:10] but we see
[1:50:12] that you know if we look you know let's
[1:50:15] just go to Psalms chapter 37.
[1:50:17] because sometimes we can look at look at
[1:50:20] the world around us
[1:50:22] and we can be envious
[1:50:25] of what others have
[1:50:27] amen I'll just yep
[1:50:31] because
[1:50:33] especially being a father and a husband
[1:50:34] you want to give the best to your family
[1:50:37] amen you want them to have nice things
[1:50:39] you want them to be comfortable
[1:50:41] and then you can if if we're not careful
[1:50:44] we can become envious of what others
[1:50:46] have
[1:50:47] but remember when I said when God said
[1:50:50] I'm just going to bless I'm not talking
[1:50:52] about material things
[1:50:54] I'm talking about a real blessing or
[1:50:56] wouldn't it be yeah sure a blessing can
[1:50:58] come in a material thing but I'm talking
[1:51:00] about a real blessing
[1:51:01] so we've got a Psalms 37 and verse 34.
[1:51:05] he says this here he says wait on the
[1:51:08] Lord
[1:51:09] and keep his way and he shall exalt thee
[1:51:12] to inherit the land when the wicked are
[1:51:14] cut off thou shall see it I have seen
[1:51:17] the wicked in great power and spreading
[1:51:19] himself like a Green Bay tree yet he
[1:51:22] passed away and lo he was not Yaya
[1:51:24] sought him but he could not be found but
[1:51:28] the transgressions are sorry
[1:51:31] he could not be found
[1:51:33] Mark the perfect man and uphold the
[1:51:35] upright for the end of that manner's
[1:51:37] peace but the transgressors shall be
[1:51:39] destroyed together the end of the wicked
[1:51:41] shall be cut off but the salvation of
[1:51:43] the righteous is of the Lord he is their
[1:51:46] strength in the time of trouble and the
[1:51:48] Lord shall help them and deliver them he
[1:51:50] shall deliver them from the wicked and
[1:51:52] save them because they trust in him so
[1:51:55] David said I saw the wicked like a big
[1:51:57] you know oh what a great big house they
[1:52:00] have and a great career and everything's
[1:52:01] going so well
[1:52:03] but then he saw yet they passed away
[1:52:04] they were nothing
[1:52:06] amen so he's saying don't look at hell
[1:52:08] don't look at how people prosper
[1:52:11] sure God is in prosperity too but don't
[1:52:13] look at that I'm talking about a real
[1:52:15] blessing
[1:52:16] God's real he says that he's just gonna
[1:52:18] bless
[1:52:19] and that blessing really isn't spiritual
[1:52:21] things
[1:52:22] amen that blessing is not in material
[1:52:25] things it's in spiritual things
[1:52:27] where you can know you can know where
[1:52:30] you come from and who you are to me
[1:52:32] that's a real blessing it just adds
[1:52:33] stability upon your life you say I know
[1:52:36] who my father is I know where I came
[1:52:38] from and I know where I'm going and all
[1:52:40] and all this life is is just character
[1:52:43] building Hallelujah but he has an end
[1:52:45] result in mind and that's his desire
[1:52:47] Amen to see me come into my maturity my
[1:52:50] perfection
[1:52:51] Hallelujah so just walk with God
[1:52:54] you know you just think you just think
[1:52:56] of what of what we you know
[1:52:59] you know the message we have this this
[1:53:01] Bible is not a sealed book anymore I
[1:53:04] mean we know we know what God is doing
[1:53:06] we know what he has done we know where
[1:53:09] we are in the word we're not stumbling
[1:53:11] around in darkness
[1:53:13] we don't have to go and look at
[1:53:14] conspiracy theories and get caught up in
[1:53:17] numbers and blood moons and all those
[1:53:18] things and you know look at what people
[1:53:20] call the Illuminati and all this mumbo
[1:53:22] jumbo you know we don't have to we've
[1:53:24] had us uh thus saith the Lord on the
[1:53:26] word
[1:53:27] amen so we know where we are
[1:53:29] this whole world is scared
[1:53:32] the world is scared
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] we're not scared
[1:53:38] the world is a troubled place but we
[1:53:40] have peace amen the world is a confused
[1:53:43] place but we have a clear mind
[1:53:45] I'm in this world is falling but we're
[1:53:47] ascending
[1:53:48] we know where we are
[1:53:51] now to me that's a blessing
[1:53:53] because a lost person the first thing
[1:53:56] they want to know is we're there and how
[1:53:57] they get out
[1:53:59] amen and this world is lost and they
[1:54:02] have big forums and they had the big
[1:54:04] climate change thing in France and
[1:54:05] they're gonna we're gonna do this and
[1:54:07] we're gonna fix this this is how we're
[1:54:08] gonna have peace and you're no doubt
[1:54:10] we're Syria and all these things there's
[1:54:12] diplomatic communication going across
[1:54:14] the globe and they're trying to fix it
[1:54:17] but they don't know how to get out
[1:54:20] they don't have a way out
[1:54:22] they don't have the way out friends and
[1:54:24] God just says here's the way out
[1:54:26] Hallelujah you know that would uh it
[1:54:29] says in John 14 I go to prepare a place
[1:54:31] for you that word prepare actually means
[1:54:34] to make a way
[1:54:35] Hallelujah
[1:54:37] so
[1:54:38] we're blessed amen we're blessed people
[1:54:41] I I know I don't need to tell you that
[1:54:43] but we're a blessed people that we know
[1:54:45] where we're going and we know where
[1:54:46] we're from and that God is our father he
[1:54:50] said well I never knew my dad growing up
[1:54:51] God is your father oh we have a
[1:54:54] relationship with your real dad
[1:54:56] Hallelujah
[1:54:57] you know we see let's go to Numbers
[1:54:59] Chapter 23.
[1:55:01] remember if God has called you
[1:55:04] I don't care how quiet members are still
[1:55:06] Small Voice brother Brown says in one
[1:55:08] place that funny feeling you feel come
[1:55:10] over you that's God calling you
[1:55:13] I mean so it's so simple I need a big
[1:55:16] Heavens open all these things no just
[1:55:18] sometimes something on you says you know
[1:55:19] you're wrong
[1:55:21] what is that that's God calling
[1:55:25] Hallelujah all the grace of God
[1:55:28] Holly I know and whom I have believed
[1:55:30] Hallelujah numbers 23.
[1:55:33] now here we have a numbers 22-25 is a
[1:55:36] story of of Israel going and and they
[1:55:40] want to pass through Moab to go into the
[1:55:42] promised land and the king of mob will
[1:55:44] not let them pass and he tries to get
[1:55:46] the you know he tries to he knows he
[1:55:48] can't defeat them in battle
[1:55:50] so he gets another Prophet Balaam to try
[1:55:53] and curse them that's what he tries to
[1:55:55] do
[1:55:56] and this Prophet remember prophets the
[1:55:59] word of the Lord comes to the prophet
[1:56:00] doesn't matter if he's a true vessel or
[1:56:02] a false vessel and it says so I'm only
[1:56:04] taking one instance
[1:56:07] and let's just read this in numbers 23
[1:56:08] 16-21
[1:56:13] and so he tries to get it to to curse
[1:56:15] them three times takes him to three
[1:56:17] different places and all the and the
[1:56:19] Lord met Balaam and put a word in his
[1:56:21] mouth and said go unto balak which is
[1:56:23] the king of Moab and say thus and when
[1:56:26] he had come to him behold he stood by
[1:56:28] his burnt offering and the princes of
[1:56:31] mob with him and balak said unto him
[1:56:32] what hath the Lord spoken remember
[1:56:35] they're they're believing in the same
[1:56:36] God
[1:56:38] what has the Lord spoken
[1:56:40] and he took up his Parable and said rise
[1:56:43] up Bala can hear hearken unto me thou
[1:56:46] zone of of of zapor God is not a man
[1:56:50] that he should lie neither the son of
[1:56:52] man that he should repent hath he said
[1:56:55] and shall he not do it or have he spoken
[1:56:58] and it's and he shall not make it good
[1:57:00] behold I have received commandment to
[1:57:02] bless and he has blessed and I cannot
[1:57:04] reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity
[1:57:07] in Jacob neither have he seen
[1:57:09] perverseness in Israel the Lord his God
[1:57:12] is with him and The Shard of a king is
[1:57:14] among them
[1:57:15] Hallelujah this is what this is what God
[1:57:17] saw me because what a prophet says is
[1:57:20] not what he thinks it's what God is
[1:57:22] declaring and so he's actually saying
[1:57:24] this is how I see Israel I have blessed
[1:57:27] them and I cannot reverse my blessing
[1:57:29] amen I have you know
[1:57:32] you know I have blessed them and I
[1:57:33] cannot reverse my blessing he says I do
[1:57:36] not behold iniquity and Jacob Emma God
[1:57:38] sees everything he was a people that had
[1:57:42] you know because of one part
[1:57:44] uh a Bellic system I mean I mean I mean
[1:57:47] sister Balaam come around this side of
[1:57:48] Israel and I'll show you its back parts
[1:57:51] so I'll show you the worst part of the
[1:57:53] camp I'll show you the worst Believers
[1:57:55] among them
[1:57:56] surely when you see all the all the all
[1:57:59] the Badness and you know all the all the
[1:58:00] sin they do surely you'll curse them
[1:58:02] when you see that because God is a
[1:58:04] righteous God I mean God judges sin he's
[1:58:07] not a doubting Granddad he's a father
[1:58:09] that corrects us children deals with sin
[1:58:12] surely surely because you know the Lord
[1:58:15] like this because this is how God is you
[1:58:16] know when you see them in this way then
[1:58:19] you'll then God will be mad because
[1:58:21] you'll be Looking Through The Eyes of
[1:58:22] that prophet and he'll curse them but
[1:58:24] then God says no I cannot curse what
[1:58:27] I've blessed
[1:58:28] I cannot curse that which I have elected
[1:58:31] I cannot curse that which I have you
[1:58:34] know blessed and I cannot reverse my
[1:58:36] blessing if I have blessed they are
[1:58:38] blessed and I and not only that but I
[1:58:40] see no iniquity in her I see no sick
[1:58:43] yeah I see no iniquity in Jacob
[1:58:46] now
[1:58:47] we are the spiritual Israel
[1:58:50] amen so when the devil speaks to God
[1:58:54] about you remember the accuser of the
[1:58:55] Brethren will be cast down and he's
[1:58:57] falling even now as the bride goes up he
[1:59:00] comes down remember
[1:59:02] and so Satan
[1:59:04] Satan comes before God and accuses you
[1:59:08] like he did about job
[1:59:11] you see what they did the other day
[1:59:13] you see how they did that they even
[1:59:15] premeditated it and they did this and
[1:59:18] they did this wrong and look at them
[1:59:19] over here look at what they've done
[1:59:22] and God says to him
[1:59:24] I see no iniquity in her Hallelujah I
[1:59:27] see what I have blessed
[1:59:29] because he because Satan would say you
[1:59:32] must curse remember Satan has made the
[1:59:34] world in this way because he knows God
[1:59:36] must pour judgment upon it
[1:59:38] because if he if he judged soda and
[1:59:40] Gomorrah for what they did he must also
[1:59:43] burn this world with fire
[1:59:45] amen so he knows he knows that if he
[1:59:49] gets man into a certain State like this
[1:59:51] then God must judge it
[1:59:53] so that's why Satan comes to God and
[1:59:56] says look at look at these people that
[1:59:58] claim to be the bride of Christ and they
[2:00:00] claim to follow this message and they
[2:00:02] claim to know you in the power of your
[2:00:04] resurrection and the likeness of your
[2:00:05] sufferings and look at these things that
[2:00:07] they fail every day they fail
[2:00:09] amen and we do
[2:00:11] but then when God looks at you he says
[2:00:13] what I have blessed
[2:00:15] you're blessed I could literally say
[2:00:17] thus saith the Lord the bride is blessed
[2:00:19] and I cannot reverse my blessing
[2:00:22] amen what I have blessed that woman I
[2:00:24] have blessed you shall be blessed and I
[2:00:27] cannot reverse it I see no iniquity in
[2:00:29] her earlier because they have because
[2:00:31] remember with Moses
[2:00:33] they had the smitten Rock they had the
[2:00:35] manner in the wilderness they had the
[2:00:36] brass serpent amen they had the
[2:00:38] attributes of God among them Divine
[2:00:41] Healing amen provision for their Journey
[2:00:43] you know their their shoes you read in
[2:00:45] Deuteronomy their shoes didn't get old
[2:00:47] they're closed didn't get old 40 years
[2:00:49] God gave them strength because they
[2:00:51] walked out of Egypt under the blood of
[2:00:53] the Lamb holy they took the communion
[2:00:56] and gave them strength to walk 40 years
[2:00:58] Hallelujah God equipped them
[2:01:01] Moab didn't have those things they had
[2:01:04] the same sacrifice the same approach
[2:01:05] they didn't have the same results
[2:01:09] Glory
[2:01:10] Amen to God
[2:01:12] if you're blessed you're blessed
[2:01:14] that's it in the story
[2:01:16] it doesn't matter remember God's love is
[2:01:18] not like parental care
[2:01:20] he'll allow you to go all through all
[2:01:22] kinds of things
[2:01:24] and he'll allow you to maybe go through
[2:01:26] terrible things but remember that does
[2:01:28] not mean God does not love you
[2:01:31] because you've been elected you've been
[2:01:34] called
[2:01:35] that's it
[2:01:36] you say well many have called them few
[2:01:38] are chosen how do you know you're chosen
[2:01:40] because when you called to him
[2:01:43] something happened to you
[2:01:45] you can look back in your life and say
[2:01:46] once I was this but no I'm not that
[2:01:49] anymore something has happened
[2:01:52] amen amen I'm not just talking about
[2:01:54] maybe the way he dresses change some
[2:01:56] your Nature's changed
[2:01:58] the way you look at things is different
[2:02:01] what has happened that's God's doing
[2:02:04] Hallelujah
[2:02:06] Glory
[2:02:09] amen there's no temptation taking you
[2:02:12] but such as is common to man but God is
[2:02:15] faithful
[2:02:17] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[2:02:19] above that you're able but will with
[2:02:21] Temptations also make your way of Escape
[2:02:23] that you may be able to bear it
[2:02:26] Hallelujah
[2:02:27] amen he says this now
[2:02:31] you say well he say I'm just I'm just
[2:02:32] kidding by
[2:02:34] I've had a desert of a of a year or a
[2:02:36] decade or whatever it is I have this for
[2:02:38] you this is an Isaiah 42 behold my
[2:02:41] servant whom I uphold might elect and
[2:02:44] whom my soul delighteth I have put my
[2:02:46] spirit upon him and he shall bring forth
[2:02:48] judgment to the Gentiles he shall not
[2:02:50] cry nor lift up nor causes voice to be
[2:02:53] heard in the street a bruise read shall
[2:02:56] he not break and the smoking Flacks
[2:02:58] shall he not quench he shall bring forth
[2:03:01] judgment unto truth he shall not fail
[2:03:03] nor be discouraged till he has set
[2:03:05] judgment in the earth and the Isles
[2:03:07] shall wait for his law so he's saying a
[2:03:09] smoking Flex is not going to quench it
[2:03:11] he said I don't even know if there's a
[2:03:13] fire burning in my soul anymore he won't
[2:03:15] quench that fire
[2:03:17] amen he shall not you say well I I don't
[2:03:20] he said I'm so dry
[2:03:22] I feel like I'm I'm you know Antarctica
[2:03:25] is the driest place in the world
[2:03:29] whether you believe it or not you said I
[2:03:31] I feel like that I'm all frozen over you
[2:03:34] won't quench what's in you
[2:03:36] amen he will not quench it Hallelujah
[2:03:39] and he knows what you're able to bear
[2:03:43] you know it doesn't matter if the whole
[2:03:44] world falls apart
[2:03:46] walk with God
[2:03:48] has ordained remember he has confidence
[2:03:51] in you
[2:03:52] God has you say well I don't know if I
[2:03:54] can do this God has confidence you're
[2:03:57] not a coach you know I remember being
[2:03:58] young playing hockey and all these
[2:03:59] things a coach analyzes the players and
[2:04:02] their performance and and and their best
[2:04:04] position in the team
[2:04:06] and they can see things in the player
[2:04:08] more than even the player can see it in
[2:04:10] themselves because the coaches Analyze
[2:04:12] That player and so they say no you go
[2:04:14] play a wing or you go play send a half
[2:04:17] or you know you know whatever position
[2:04:18] the coach places you in that position
[2:04:21] because he knows you have the qualities
[2:04:22] to play that position
[2:04:24] you say well I don't really have
[2:04:26] confidence I can do it God has
[2:04:28] confidence in you
[2:04:30] amen God has confidence in you he had if
[2:04:33] he had confidence in Joe he sure has
[2:04:35] confidence in you
[2:04:37] amen
[2:04:39] now
[2:04:41] this is doesn't testimonies this is a
[2:04:43] 1950 this is this is a prayer line I
[2:04:45] just you know sometimes
[2:04:48] sometimes
[2:04:49] we love to put up a wall
[2:04:52] sometimes we like to think everything's
[2:04:53] peachy
[2:04:56] because because in some ways we
[2:04:58] shouldn't confess the devil's Works sure
[2:05:01] we should confess the word
[2:05:03] but if we if we lean too far that way
[2:05:06] the devil can literally Force us into a
[2:05:08] corner
[2:05:09] I mean
[2:05:10] and then we become cut off
[2:05:13] from the rest of the body of Christ
[2:05:14] because we want to put up a good a good
[2:05:18] uh everything's fine I'm a Believer
[2:05:19] praise the Lord here I am
[2:05:21] I'm bride
[2:05:23] friends
[2:05:25] this isn't James to confess your faults
[2:05:27] one to another not your sins you confess
[2:05:29] into God but confess your faults
[2:05:31] because if we pray for one another I'm
[2:05:34] not talking about finding out Prince to
[2:05:37] gossip that's wrong
[2:05:39] but if there's a if you have a need you
[2:05:42] say well I'm battling certain and you
[2:05:44] can put confidence in certain people in

[2:08:57] time of life of a little girl as your
[2:08:59] mother near the uh in the building I
[2:09:01] thought so I could feel her out there I
[2:09:04] thought mother you know what I'm
[2:09:05] speaking about don't you it's just her
[2:09:07] little age right now is what's doing
[2:09:10] that
[2:09:11] amen and don't you you know fly right or

[2:09:19] right for you you believe that say amen
[2:09:21] God bless you Sister
[2:09:23] see I read that because Satan remember
[2:09:26] Satan was this is a little girl Satan
[2:09:29] was Desiring to sift her
[2:09:31] but he said but we're praying now
[2:09:34] hey man the same God friends that was
[2:09:37] there as present
[2:09:38] I believe with all my heart that same
[2:09:40] God you know you say a big trial comes
[2:09:42] in your life Satan is Desiring to sift
[2:09:46] you
[2:09:47] I mean to separate you out from Walking
[2:09:49] with God
[2:09:50] but Jesus but I've prayed
[2:09:53] hallelujah it's the same thing even
[2:09:55] today that's why I was so blessed when I
[2:09:57] read this is but we're praying now in
[2:09:59] other words if Satan Satan desired to
[2:10:02] destroy he said you'd be a wreck after a
[2:10:04] while she'll be a wreck after a while so
[2:10:07] if she kept going down that road she'll
[2:10:09] become a wreck
[2:10:10] Satan wants to wreck Our Lives friends
[2:10:13] we have an enemy it's not a imagination
[2:10:16] he's a real devil and there's a real you
[2:10:19] know there's real powers of Darkness but
[2:10:21] if there's real power seduct hey we see
[2:10:23] on the street we see Darkness man
[2:10:25] don't we we see Darkness manifested you
[2:10:29] say how dark is this world how terrible
[2:10:30] everything's gone pear-shaped if that is
[2:10:33] so on the negative how much more God is
[2:10:35] present Amen to strengthen his children
[2:10:38] in this time of trouble
[2:10:40] Hallelujah Satan has desired to sift her
[2:10:43] but we're praying now that's why it's so
[2:10:45] powerful
[2:10:46] don't don't don't put on a false
[2:10:49] impression
[2:10:50] sure wish we should confess what the
[2:10:52] word says
[2:10:54] they say you you go to a brother or
[2:10:56] sister you say I need prayer
[2:10:58] I really need prayer for something
[2:11:01] why because Satan it doesn't matter how
[2:11:03] young
[2:11:04] how old
[2:11:06] Satan desires to sift us
[2:11:09] amen just turn us into some commodity
[2:11:11] for his kingdom
[2:11:14] don't don't just sit there
[2:11:17] do something about it
[2:11:19] amen do something about it
[2:11:22] because God's that is not God's desire
[2:11:25] I was thinking Satan he wants to destroy
[2:11:28] relationships
[2:11:30] he wants to destroy families there's a
[2:11:32] certain point where God says no
[2:11:35] you can't do it
[2:11:37] amen
[2:11:38] he comes you know you you see him
[2:11:40] working I'm gonna destroy that one
[2:11:43] I'm gonna destroy you and God says no
[2:11:47] you can't do that Satan I want to cause
[2:11:50] these people to end up in divorce God
[2:11:51] says no
[2:11:52] you just think on the day of judgment
[2:11:54] it's not just men being judged there
[2:11:55] it's angels will be judged as well and
[2:11:58] those demon spirits will come up before
[2:12:00] the Lord and the Lord will say you try
[2:12:02] to destroy a family of my bride
[2:12:06] hallelujah what a fearful and and they
[2:12:09] know they've got it coming they know
[2:12:11] they've got it coming but what a fearful
[2:12:13] thing amen I say you know Satan's
[2:12:16] defeated being
[2:12:17] he has no right you think well this is
[2:12:20] just how life is it's a new season we
[2:12:22] just have to ride it out not necessarily
[2:12:25] not necessarily friends
[2:12:27] don't live below your privilege
[2:12:30] amen if there's something especially
[2:12:32] between you know this world is
[2:12:34] engineered to divorce the whole world
[2:12:37] this is what this world the whole world
[2:12:40] is engineered to break up husbands and
[2:12:42] wives and Families this this whole
[2:12:44] society we live in is engineered for
[2:12:46] that one goal destroy everything just
[2:12:49] make everything a wasteland
[2:12:51] there comes a point where God says no
[2:12:54] you cannot destroy this family Satan you
[2:12:57] cannot destroy this relationship you
[2:12:59] cannot destroy this family relationship
[2:13:02] Hallelujah Hallelujah hey man we should
[2:13:05] live up we should accept what God has
[2:13:07] for us if anything can remember if
[2:13:09] anything comes into the family it's all
[2:13:11] haphazard just realize it's not the
[2:13:13] person doing it that's the devil doing
[2:13:15] it I mean we wrestled not against flesh
[2:13:18] and blood
[2:13:19] but against demon Pals remember that
[2:13:23] Hallelujah things are going funny
[2:13:25] it's not them the enemy is never your
[2:13:28] brother or sister
[2:13:29] or your spouse or your child
[2:13:32] the enemy is never them the enemy is the
[2:13:35] devil
[2:13:36] even if they are believing Satan's lie
[2:13:39] they are not the enemy
[2:13:41] so whatever you do never turn your guns
[2:13:44] on them turn your guns on the devil
[2:13:47] Hallelujah and pray and seek the Lord's
[2:13:49] face you know if there's a crisis you
[2:13:51] see in the book of Acts Peter was going
[2:13:53] to get killed
[2:13:54] they didn't haphazardly say well if he's
[2:13:56] elected to die he's alive whatever this
[2:13:58] is his time he's he's lived out his
[2:14:00] portion of the word because he opened
[2:14:02] the door on the you know day of
[2:14:04] Pentecost all these things
[2:14:05] they had a prayer meeting
[2:14:07] they had a brother bound
[2:14:09] and they were not willing they were not
[2:14:12] willing to leave that brother bound
[2:14:14] they are not willing to let that brother
[2:14:16] die
[2:14:17] and they prayed and they prayed and God
[2:14:21] answered the prayer
[2:14:23] amen friends now call you friends
[2:14:27] we have the same faith that they have
[2:14:30] and we have a greater portion of Faith
[2:14:32] because the word's been open to us like
[2:14:33] it wasn't to them
[2:14:36] that's why there's times
[2:14:38] where we should have at this particular
[2:14:40] need
[2:14:41] you say well
[2:14:43] whatever you do I think I said it you
[2:14:45] know I had during the week I was walking
[2:14:47] down the stairs at work
[2:14:49] and the devil will challenge me on this
[2:14:50] but something anchored in my heart my
[2:14:53] three girls are the Lords
[2:14:55] it wasn't I hope so
[2:14:57] something Anchored In My Heart they
[2:14:59] belong to him
[2:15:00] Hallelujah
[2:15:02] you pray until because if God has
[2:15:05] revealed that to you nothing will move
[2:15:07] it
[2:15:07] amen because there's always a doubt you
[2:15:10] know the devil loves to come in maybe
[2:15:11] your kids are praying that way because
[2:15:13] they're not gods
[2:15:15] this is it this is how the devil Works
[2:15:17] he says maybe they're just not elected
[2:15:19] you throw that out
[2:15:21] you reject that in the name of Jesus
[2:15:23] Christ whatever you do oh my spouse or
[2:15:25] extended family of a burden for maybe
[2:15:27] they're just not called you reject that
[2:15:29] do not even give a second on that
[2:15:32] thought
[2:15:33] he said God they're part of my
[2:15:35] inheritance they must come
[2:15:37] Hallelujah Moses said will not leave one
[2:15:39] hoof behind
[2:15:41] so you probably seek God about it
[2:15:44] remember when you use your faith that
[2:15:47] you had for yourself use it for your
[2:15:48] family
[2:15:50] whatever you do
[2:15:52] and don't let this world make you
[2:15:54] callous
[2:15:55] and indifferent well I gave them a
[2:15:57] chance was it God's timing was it God's
[2:15:59] chance
[2:16:01] I heard I heard a uh um yeah I heard in
[2:16:05] a sermon yesterday
[2:16:07] there's in a prayer line I wish I found
[2:16:09] it a man comes before brother Branham
[2:16:12] and he had a tract in his hand that he
[2:16:13] wrote
[2:16:15] and he and it was called I is God real
[2:16:20] and said I blasphemed God basically this
[2:16:23] man wrote it he actually totally
[2:16:25] rejected
[2:16:26] totally rejected the Lord younger and he
[2:16:28] wrote a tract about distributed it he
[2:16:30] came before The Prophet it was all in
[2:16:32] the recording
[2:16:34] and brother Barracks he said you
[2:16:36] actually love him
[2:16:38] but you know the devil's Twisted you
[2:16:40] around all these things and he prayed
[2:16:42] for him that he would he would receive
[2:16:44] his salvation
[2:16:46] I can guarantee
[2:16:48] if I was standing there I'll be honest I
[2:16:51] think this man has crossed the line
[2:16:54] I mean this man has crossed remember
[2:16:56] that is God's doing if someone's crossed
[2:16:59] the line or not
[2:17:00] amen
[2:17:02] and that man received what he needed
[2:17:04] there
[2:17:07] do not turn your back on your family or
[2:17:11] your friends you say they want nothing
[2:17:13] to do with this Jesus I love Paul didn't
[2:17:16] want anything to do with it either
[2:17:17] amen he wanted nothing to do with it at
[2:17:20] all
[2:17:21] and look what happened to him he said
[2:17:23] well there's no more Messengers they're
[2:17:25] still bride to be called
[2:17:27] amen
[2:17:29] so we should pray
[2:17:32] we should come together if there's a
[2:17:33] great need
[2:17:34] we should have times of prayer but what
[2:17:36] if he doesn't answer what if he does
[2:17:39] give him something to work with
[2:17:41] him oh well that's just human ambition
[2:17:43] no it's not if they did it in the book
[2:17:44] of Acts
[2:17:46] they didn't just say well that was just
[2:17:48] predestinated to happen it's finished
[2:17:49] they prayed David when when remember
[2:17:52] when he had the first child with
[2:17:54] Bathsheba
[2:17:56] and the child was sick he was on his
[2:17:58] face praying
[2:18:00] he didn't just say well this is just a
[2:18:02] judgment of God and just he was on his
[2:18:04] face praying
[2:18:05] but then when he found out the child
[2:18:07] died he washed himself he went into the
[2:18:09] house of God and he gave him praise
[2:18:11] amen
[2:18:13] friends
[2:18:15] we should that is that that is a bright
[2:18:18] attribute I know I'm being long but but
[2:18:21] that is the bride on display
[2:18:23] amen you might you must be able to see
[2:18:25] yourself in those kind of stories
[2:18:27] where they where they interceded for
[2:18:29] someone
[2:18:30] if there's life in the body There's Hope
[2:18:34] Hallelujah well they're on the other
[2:18:36] side of the world that's irrelevant I

[2:20:04] treasure and he just rejoiced he said I
[2:20:07] haven't I haven't missed my day and he
[2:20:10] went to the Altar and he gave his heart
[2:20:11] to Christ right there because his sister
