[27:31] praise the Lord thank you now you can
[27:38] have your seats actually my um sometimes
[27:43] I don't have a typical scripture to
[27:44] start and why I'm assuming with and this
[27:47] one's kind of one of those one say but I
[27:49] have scriptures all the way through I
[27:51] just don't have one it's that - I'm work
[27:55] with brother Adam was saying something
[28:00] about having a funny week not that it
[28:11] means much but I was at a I had a bit of
[28:14] a schedule to keep today and you know
[28:17] and your mind you finger cave and the
[28:19] morning I'll do this and it will take me
[28:20] till about this time and then I'll do
[28:21] this and listen this and then I leaned
[28:23] up homie at such a time and then will
[28:25] come here you kind of have it all
[28:26] planned out
[28:27] you know I was apart from a slight
[28:31] sleeping which is typical I am over half
[28:34] an hour or something I was am on time we
[28:38] had to finish off a job I started the
[28:39] day before I'm laying a floor and I just
[28:43] finished it and the the older guy there
[28:45] said could you give me a hand to move
[28:47] the fridge back into the spot so we had
[28:49] to move the fridge across the floor into
[28:51] where the fridge goes and I say yeah
[28:55] I'll give you a hand to do that and we
[28:56] put boxes down and rolled this thing and
[28:58] all was well and he we put it in the
[29:02] little spot where it goes
[29:06] and I just lifted up the boxes to check
[29:09] there was no damage there and when I
[29:11] lifted up it was a mess of scratch going
[29:13] right across the new floor so I put the
[29:15] Box down real quick as he was there he
[29:17] was about to go out well maybe I can
[29:19] just
[29:19] you can't fix these things up and no one
[29:21] knows about it this is a few little
[29:22] tricks but so he left to go and you know
[29:25] I couldn't fix this thing I tried went
[29:27] and bought some walnut you can actually
[29:29] get it's a little trick for you if you
[29:30] scratch your timber products you can get
[29:32] a piece of walnut and rub it on the
[29:33] scratches yeah didn't work I got I was
[29:36] getting fuller rubbing that in there
[29:37] doing all sorts of things
[29:38] nothing works man and then when you got
[29:40] back about 45 minutes later he said all
[29:42] right
[29:43] I said now there's actually a big
[29:44] scratch all the way through this floor
[29:46] so I had to like I would have had to
[29:49] come back at some point and replace the
[29:51] floor side just did it when I was there
[29:53] but I had to unclick it all from you
[29:55] know flooring it's like difficult you
[29:56] can't just flick it back and the in
[29:58] spots were really hard on the fridge was
[29:59] here so it took me about a couple of
[30:01] hours to unclick all these boards and
[30:02] then replace these three pieces and then
[30:05] take all the other pieces back and it
[30:07] kind of reminded me I thought about it I
[30:09] thought you know you can do one little
[30:10] event one time just a small event we did
[30:14] and yet the the trouble that it caused
[30:15] that we had to try and undo this little
[30:18] bit of damage that we've done life is
[30:21] like that you know it's good to be
[30:22] careful the way we walk because we can
[30:24] make a just do a little thing what seems
[30:25] so small and could happen so quickly and
[30:27] there's a lot of time to to try and put
[30:29] everything back together so this was a
[30:31] couple of hours so I was a couple of
[30:33] hours behind schedule and as a result I
[30:35] couldn't quite I couldn't get to another
[30:37] job to pick up a tool to do the next job
[30:39] I had to do so I had to go I'm sort of
[30:41] gone by at all just grinder and then all
[30:44] the I was trying to grind the job in all
[30:46] the parts the grinder wouldn't works all
[30:47] the parts weren't clicking together
[30:49] because you can't have to mess with us
[30:50] for a while it wouldn't work I finally
[30:52] got it to work and I was actually on
[30:54] schedule to leave for that job at 4
[30:55] o'clock but I just cut out a whole lot
[30:57] of other jobs because I couldn't get to
[30:58] them and then I was driving home and my
[31:01] wife rung me up she had some good news I
[31:03] can't mean what it was then she said I'm
[31:06] by the way and now I was grinding before
[31:08] I had all this dust all over me and it's
[31:10] all like feeling me jack and he said oh
[31:13] and another thing happened today she
[31:14] said we actually ran out of water the
[31:15] middle of winter eh you ran out of water
[31:19] but I think because it rains you don't
[31:21] really think to keep the tanks but the
[31:22] gutters I think must have been a bit
[31:24] blocked or maybe it hasn't actually
[31:25] rained much this winter I think it
[31:27] hasn't rained much I don't think it has
[31:29] anyway so he said I've to say but that's
[31:33] all right there's still some water up in
[31:34] the heater tank you know cause like I
[31:36] wanted to give all the dust off me
[31:38] but that hot water cylinder there's only
[31:42] on a weak bit system so if you so I said
[31:46] okay that one's going and it's called
[31:47] there's a small amount of water and the
[31:49] heater tank that's left over but as the
[31:50] fire going because the hot water
[31:52] cylinders that only works on a wet back
[31:54] that particular cylinder that feeds from
[31:56] that tank she said oh no I'll quickly
[31:57] like the fire now so she I think and I
[32:00] was about 20 minutes from hind so she'd
[32:01] cook me lit the fire and be to try and
[32:03] heat up that was what a cylinder it kind
[32:06] of half with and we made it here in the
[32:07] end but that wasn't really a bad day
[32:12] there with these were small problems
[32:13] they weren't really problems and they
[32:15] were just there were things you just can
[32:16] find solutions for in it sometimes we
[32:19] have problems where they are no
[32:20] solutions you know you know those
[32:22] problems that's actual problems you know
[32:25] the children complain about this problem
[32:27] that problem but there's an easy
[32:28] solution even if it takes a day some
[32:31] problems there are no foreseeable
[32:33] solutions and those are the ones where
[32:35] you say Lord I need you for this one
[32:39] okay that's not my sermon but I'm I've
[32:44] only got a sermon it tonight I haven't
[32:48] had a lot of time to do my usual pull a
[32:51] whole lot of things together but I've
[32:53] avoided runny-nosed I've avoided I'm
[33:01] preaching for about the last month I've
[33:03] managed to sidestep it and get other
[33:04] people up and brothers have come and
[33:06] they've taken the spot size of minister
[33:08] wheeze them all out of it for about a
[33:10] month but I've been got me this time
[33:12] because brother Andy took last week you
[33:15] know when I was a younger when I was
[33:16] younger I wanted to be at the front but
[33:19] nobody would let me now that I'm
[33:23] slightly older I want to be at the back
[33:26] and no one will meet me
[33:28] but I think this out is in the Lord when
[33:31] we go on it but we realize we actually
[33:33] don't have much of ourselves to say in
[33:35] to offer you know and we're a bit more
[33:38] cautious of how we deal in life because
[33:40] we realize we're not really there
[33:41] we're not overly smart we're not we're
[33:43] not as wise as what we thought we were
[33:44] and we just trust in the Lord I mean
[33:46] okay let's um the message I want to
[33:48] speak about tonight I've made some of
[33:52] the words a bit bigger but not this one
[33:54] um it's I had this funny thought that
[33:57] called attitude and I want to just speak
[34:00] about attitude for a little while this
[34:02] evening and attitude as a player our
[34:09] attitude plays a major part in our life
[34:12] you know we have different attitudes as
[34:15] we go through days and and we may have
[34:20] the same attitude towards something for
[34:21] a very long time this way or that way
[34:23] and the word attitude actually isn't in
[34:26] the King James because the actual word
[34:28] itself wasn't the word attitude that we
[34:31] know wasn't made up until after the King
[34:34] James Bible was translated so you won't
[34:36] actually find the word attitude in the
[34:38] other we all know what it means but I
[34:41] just got the meaning for myself and
[34:43] attitude means a feeling or opinion
[34:45] about something with someone or a way of
[34:49] behaving that is caused by this
[35:05] attitude it's got a good attitude today
[35:09] that's what we want a good attitude hey
[35:11] man now this is not so much going to be
[35:13] a bit how to get a good attitude and you
[35:14] know just because we're talking about
[35:15] attitude I'll just say a few things
[35:18] about the the just about our natural
[35:21] attitude but this is more going to be
[35:23] about our spiritual attitude but but
[35:26] there are but it it encompasses a lot of
[35:29] things and our attitude is actually
[35:32] governed by if I can articulate a
[35:34] property or by our thought process
[35:36] essentially determines how what our
[35:39] attitude will be in a situation or
[35:41] towards anything because it's a result
[35:44] of the way we think about something for
[35:45] instance let's say brother Andrews about
[35:53] to get married and he's found this the
[35:56] girl of his dreams
[35:57] found her you know so he's found the
[36:02] girl of his dreams hypothetically
[36:03] speaking now because in his mind he's
[36:07] been wavy waiting for a wife for so long
[36:08] and he's trusting in the Lord and then
[36:10] eventually he finds a wife and it's this
[36:14] that has the the girl that he meets as
[36:17] the girl of his dreams so he's got the
[36:19] thought process in his mind that she's
[36:21] the girl of my dreams she's so awesome
[36:23] she's just so wonderful to be around and
[36:26] we have so much fun together and she's a
[36:27] great Christian and and all these things
[36:29] and and because that's a thought process
[36:31] then has attitude we need surround her
[36:34] and towards her will always be a
[36:35] reflection of a thought process you'll
[36:37] always be hey how are you how was your
[36:39] day you know I brought you this you know
[36:43] and his attitude towards it will be
[36:45] really really good and that's the way
[36:49] that it should stay so they get married
[36:51] and it should stay that way and now
[36:55] let's take someone else because Andrew
[36:57] wouldn't do this but let's take a
[36:58] non-christian person they may they may
[37:01] start off that way but then over time
[37:03] they begin to get used to this person
[37:05] and they get to know the little things
[37:07] that they do and don't do and woods they
[37:11] say that are annoying or things they do
[37:12] they're annoying or little thought
[37:14] patterns they have that you think oh
[37:15] here she goes again the certain way
[37:17] you know and over time that can start to
[37:20] you can you can start to change the way
[37:23] that you think about here because you've
[37:26] experienced a bit and if you don't watch
[37:27] it it because you start to let those
[37:31] things change your thought process
[37:32] towards who then your attitude will
[37:34] start to get different towards here no
[37:37] it won't be like what it used to be it
[37:39] you'll start to maybe get grumpy and you
[37:42] won't be as happy to see here as often
[37:44] and all these and and you maybe might
[37:48] talk your talk to her in a way that you
[37:50] wouldn't do earlier in the piece because
[37:51] your attitude has changed and as a
[37:53] result of your thought changing but a
[37:56] Christian shouldn't do that this is a
[37:58] bit of marriage advice look it's it's
[38:03] the journey we we take but now this is
[38:08] not just in marriages but in any
[38:09] relationship it's important you've got
[38:12] to guard it and treat it well and in
[38:17] always always uphold the other person
[38:19] and high esteem you know whether you've
[38:22] known them for one month for one year or
[38:23] ten years always hold other always hold
[38:25] people in high esteem the Bible says to
[38:28] esteem each other greater than ourselves
[38:29] and see if you if you always hold that
[38:32] thought towards any person that you're
[38:34] in a relationship with then your
[38:36] attitude towards them will always be
[38:38] positive now because you esteem them and
[38:40] your thought process towards them is
[38:41] always good and you'll have a positive
[38:43] attitude towards him we're not going to
[38:44] go down the road of starting to have bad
[38:47] thoughts about people in and then having
[38:49] negative attitudes towards them that's
[38:50] not the way we want to go and who's ever
[38:52] started a new job you know and you've
[38:55] been trying to go for this job for such
[38:57] a long time and maybe you've you haven't
[38:59] studied for years and then you finally
[39:02] landed your job at that dentistry hey
[39:04] you know and you've studied when you're
[39:06] a little girl do you want to be a Newark
[39:08] he didn't but may at some point in life
[39:10] sister Hannah wanted to become a dentist
[39:13] assistant yeah yeah yeah she thought
[39:16] that's what I want to do and she would
[39:18] have studied for years and and then over
[39:21] time maybe she would have finally gotten
[39:23] the job that she wanted to get as a
[39:24] dentist dentist assistant
[39:28] and you would have been so happy maybe
[39:30] the first day she would have been so
[39:32] happy to be there and wants to learn and
[39:34] wants to please the boss and do all
[39:35] these things because here your attitude
[39:40] towards the whole job and everything
[39:42] would have been positive in helping I
[39:43] want to help out and then maybe she
[39:45] would come across people in the the same
[39:48] workers who that were a bit negative and
[39:49] she would think man why are they like
[39:50] that this is the greatest job in the
[39:52] world
[39:52] you know I'm so happy to be here and
[39:54] maybe here attitude would have would
[39:56] have encouraged them but maybe if she
[39:59] didn't watch it she wouldn't do this but
[40:00] someone else over time they you start to
[40:03] get butt sick of the way the bosses like
[40:04] this and you know they they always do
[40:06] this there and that there and why don't
[40:08] that why do they book the jobs like this
[40:10] and we you know we we have to use these
[40:12] machines why don't they get these other
[40:13] machines and you know you can start to
[40:14] get slowly change your thought process
[40:17] towards that the user can start to get
[40:18] negative you know and and then your
[40:21] attitude towards the company changes but
[40:25] not a Christian you know not a Christian
[40:28] because it the way you starts the way
[40:29] you'll finish on your last day will be
[40:31] the same as your first day because you
[40:32] think you know what I'm what I'm here
[40:34] you're my boss of you you're the
[40:36] contractors for me to do a certain to
[40:38] reach a certain standard for you or your
[40:40] company and to support your company so
[40:41] that's the way I'll be from the Dow
[40:42] start to the Dow finished
[40:43] even if these things that I don't agree
[40:45] with I'm not gonna let that change my
[40:47] thought process and change my attitude
[40:48] I'm gonna keep on having a positive
[40:49] attitude towards this business because
[40:52] that's more that was my part of the
[40:54] contract and if I don't want to live up
[40:56] to that then I should say look I don't
[40:57] want to work here anymore yeah I
[40:58] shouldn't work here and have a negative
[41:00] attitude you know because that wasn't
[41:02] part of the agreement this is maybe my
[41:05] bosses head on now but some people have
[41:06] it I maybe I can say this they I've
[41:09] heard some people say this comment I
[41:11] don't get paid to think I'm thinking man
[41:15] I'll so how much do I have to pay you to
[41:18] think
[41:18] it'll cost another there's another five
[41:20] dollars an hour ten dollars you know I'm
[41:23] sure that when we agree to do something
[41:25] we do it to the best of our ability but
[41:27] the Bible says that we should do
[41:29] everything there's actually a scripture
[41:31] on that here okay so
[41:37] and whatsoever you do do it heartily as
[41:40] to the Lord and not unto men Philippians
[41:43] 2:14 says do all things without
[41:45] murmuring and disputing z' all things
[41:49] not just most things but I can justify
[41:51] not doing that without murmuring because
[41:54] that's worth murmuring about we can
[41:57] often justify yes I'll do all these
[41:59] things but not that thing but do all
[42:01] things without murmuring and disputing
[42:02] and whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[42:05] all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[42:07] thanks to God and the Father by him I'll
[42:15] give you another this is another story
[42:18] this is really not part of my sermon yet
[42:20] but I'll go on to it about how moving on
[42:25] about our attitude you know attitude
[42:27] towards life we've got to have a
[42:29] positive attitude towards life and um
[42:32] you know we don't want to be all down
[42:34] and negative and beer be a drain to
[42:36] people we want to be a positive we want
[42:39] to be refreshing to people you know if
[42:40] people come into contact with us we want
[42:42] to think that we could refresh them yeah
[42:44] and be encouraging to them and make them
[42:47] feel good in some way that's what that's
[42:49] what I think as a Christian we want to
[42:50] do and I mean we can only really do that
[42:55] if we've got something that the Lord and
[42:57] us it's that's refreshing us but this
[42:59] this may not be part of the sermon but I
[43:01] I thought I'd say it anyway because it
[43:03] was this is just a little a little
[43:06] thought that I've taken in life that's
[43:07] helped me but it may be a bit too harsh
[43:10] for some people but it's it's my thought
[43:12] process nonetheless that's helped me not
[43:13] to complain really at all I don't I tend
[43:16] to not complain to you often I was um
[43:18] when I first got married there was a we
[43:20] looked out in the country and across the
[43:23] road was a forestry block in a header
[43:25] there was a very high Ridge and Gisborne
[43:27] they have lots of high very high hills
[43:29] and apparently my neighbor had rights to
[43:32] go and shoot the goats from off there
[43:34] because the forestry people didn't like
[43:36] the GoSee because they wouldn't hit the
[43:37] back of the trees so if he had rights to
[43:40] what I had rights to it to we sort of
[43:41] figured and it was across the road so we
[43:43] used to go and shooting the goats the
[43:44] distant bring them back for dog food and
[43:47] um
[43:48] one day I went right to the top of this
[43:50] hill and I'm pretty sure I shot two
[43:52] goats this particular time and there
[43:55] were big billy goats and I kind of
[43:56] wanted to keep their horns on these
[43:58] things just because it keep them hanging
[43:59] around and I but I gathered these two
[44:01] goats and I thought I'll drag these all
[44:02] the way back down to the house which was
[44:04] a few Kay's away down through the
[44:05] blackberry and all down this big ridge
[44:07] and then across the road and up the
[44:09] river and yeah through our place and I I
[44:13] think I had to because one would have
[44:15] been easy I could have put it on my back
[44:16] but I was maybe 20 to 23 and so I had
[44:19] these two goats by their two sets of
[44:21] horns and dragging them but I had to
[44:23] drag these things through blackberries
[44:25] and gorse and over the logs it was
[44:27] through forestry and it was a it was a
[44:29] very steep hill I'm not exaggerating it
[44:31] was very hard work to drag these things
[44:34] down man I got to the bottom of that
[44:37] hill I still had to walk quite away and
[44:39] I was exhausted man and I thought I was
[44:40] dragging these things and I thought man
[44:42] I'm gonna tell Shannon how hard this was
[44:43] when I get home
[44:46] cuz hey that's what you dude you will do
[44:49] that you know you want it you want
[44:50] someone to know this is what I went
[44:51] through you know you want to tell them
[44:53] this is how hard I've hit it no you kind
[44:56] of want to complain of it you don't
[44:58] really complain but you kind of want
[44:59] you're you're you're searching for some
[45:01] sort of sympathy you know just by
[45:03] telling sugar you know we kind of you
[45:07] know we can get in the habit of always
[45:08] complaining about stuff so we can get
[45:10] sympathy sometimes but and I dragged
[45:13] them along and I thought to myself you
[45:16] know what even if I really tried to
[45:18] explain to hear about how hard this has
[45:20] been for me she won't really ever
[45:22] understand because she didn't do it with
[45:24] me well she she she wasn't me she
[45:27] doesn't know that struggle has been to
[45:29] drag these two goats over this distance
[45:31] he's a big goats she won't really she
[45:34] won't understand this she she'll say oh
[45:36] that's you know wow but she won't really
[45:39] fully understand what I've been through
[45:42] then I thought well the him why would I
[45:46] bother even saying much about it in if
[45:47] she's not really going to understand why
[45:49] would I really say it so my first lesson
[45:52] there was I thought now this may sound a
[45:53] bit harsh but I thought no one really
[45:55] cares when you think about it unless
[45:58] they've in this they were you they don't
[46:00] really care or understand fully
[46:01] you going through it was my first that's
[46:04] not so mm-hmm
[46:05] well I accepted that fact okay that's
[46:07] actually the way that it is because
[46:09] unless they're me but then I thought you
[46:11] know what the Lord knows what I've been
[46:13] through he knows how hard this has been
[46:14] for me to drag these goats down this far
[46:17] Lord you know how hard this has been and
[46:19] you care yeah and then it was from then
[46:23] on I've kind of taken that thought in
[46:24] life to not try and complain too much
[46:26] about what I've had to go through
[46:28] because the Lord knows what I've been
[46:29] through no and and he cares and he he
[46:32] actually really understands and he
[46:34] understands what you've been through all
[46:35] of us he really understands he was there
[46:37] with you he understood it all and I'm
[46:45] glad that we come to a God like that
[46:49] okay now speaking of now I want to go
[46:51] more towards the spiritual aspect of our
[46:53] attitude yeah and we all know the story
[46:57] of um Paul and Silas in prison you know
[47:00] we sing the song it was good for Paul
[47:02] and Silas and we hear the story about
[47:06] that when they were in prison they were
[47:08] singing hymns and rejoicing and
[47:13] sometimes me I would just read that
[47:15] chapter and move on to the next chapter
[47:17] or not think too much of it but then
[47:20] when you go through some hard times once
[47:22] or twice you try singing when you're
[47:25] really really in a hard battle and when
[47:27] it really looks like it's all pretty
[47:28] bleak around you and and more so you
[47:32] can't see the hand of God anywhere sort
[47:34] of almost feels like he's maybe he's
[47:37] he's over there and he's left you
[47:38] somewhere you know maybe you're walking
[47:40] through the valley of the shadow of
[47:41] death as David said it though I walk
[47:44] through the valley of the shadow of
[47:45] death you get to that spot once or twice
[47:48] and then you start to think about Paul
[47:52] and you think okay here was Paul serving
[47:56] the Lord going out to preach the gospel
[47:58] and and Minister the Word of God and
[48:02] then over a series of events he ends up
[48:07] being beaten and all these things
[48:09] happened to me needs that being thrown
[48:10] in prison and all he's trying to do is
[48:12] actually do good and
[48:14] preaching that you think maybe the Lord
[48:15] would give him a slightly easier road
[48:17] because he's out there to preach but he
[48:18] ends up thrown in prison and and maybe
[48:22] not even understanding why he's there
[48:23] you know we think we often would like to
[48:28] make sense of everything but when you
[48:29] really start to think about the
[48:30] situation it wasn't like he was in
[48:33] church and all the brothers li he was
[48:34] singing a song he was probably hungry
[48:35] sore and pain he would have been beaten
[48:38] he maybe had other report meetings he
[48:41] was going to go to he can't get there
[48:42] now and he's they just they're in prison
[48:44] they're in stock but then the stocks
[48:46] over and they can't do a lot and yet his
[48:50] attitude was praise the Lord you know
[48:53] because here his thought process was
[48:56] well Lord you've got a purpose for all
[48:58] us and as if his attitude wasn't less it
[49:02] wasn't that and he wouldn't have praised
[49:03] a little bit said they were in there and
[49:05] they sang and they worship God and they
[49:06] praise the Lord because this attitude
[49:08] was positive his attitude didn't change
[49:12] whether he was in a church service with
[49:13] all the brothers with with the Ephesians
[49:16] and rejoicing in the Lord or whether we
[49:17] was stuck in a prison his attitude was
[49:19] the same he was still praising the Lord
[49:21] the same so it cost him something to
[49:26] sing those songs in that prison it
[49:27] wasn't easy for him and yet we hear of
[49:30] another story of another negative
[49:33] attitude where here's a people that are
[49:36] in bondage and the children of Israel
[49:39] are in bondage and and slavery and God
[49:41] sends Moses down to them as a mighty
[49:43] deliverer and they see amazing miracles
[49:47] in the mighty hand of God working to to
[49:52] defeat Pharaoh at every turn and to keep
[49:55] them safe and they see that mighty hand
[49:59] of God working and then eventually they
[50:01] all get to leave Egypt there's free
[50:03] people not only that the Egyptians give
[50:06] them all of their gold and all this all
[50:08] these treasures these people are walking
[50:10] out free and rich you know you think
[50:14] they after all that they would have
[50:15] thought man this is isn't this an
[50:17] awesome time we're living in what we we
[50:20] get to walk free and we've actually got
[50:21] all those possessions with us and we're
[50:23] going into into a promised land their
[50:26] attitude should have been
[50:27] positive and yet in the first instance
[50:32] of any sort of hardship anything not
[50:35] quite going their way the first thing
[50:37] they did was they all started
[50:39] complaining yeah well you brought us out
[50:41] here to die now and complaining towards
[50:46] Moses and murmuring oh look at all the
[50:47] snow thee and the armies are coming down
[50:49] look he's just this is a big trap we've
[50:52] wasted our time here we would have been
[50:54] better off being slaves back in Egypt
[50:55] and eating you know we had garlic there
[50:57] now look what we got here and it's just
[50:59] complaining the whole attitude was
[51:00] complaining poor Moses you can
[51:04] understand most perspective they're here
[51:06] to have more character to deal with it
[51:07] but imagine this he's like people I
[51:10] don't even want to be here either but
[51:11] God called me when I was in the
[51:12] wilderness and can't you see that he's
[51:14] doing this what could I do I'm just a
[51:17] nobody like you but God just happened to
[51:19] call me and I'm here to actually help
[51:20] you've given up my life farming come
[51:23] here to help you and now we and we've
[51:25] got I've gotten us the Lord's gotten us
[51:26] this far now something happens all you
[51:27] do is complain it's the wrong attitude
[51:30] to take in it and God didn't actually
[51:33] like that attitude either because it
[51:35] stemmed back to a to a thought process
[51:38] that they didn't fully trust in God
[51:40] which was why they had the attitude that
[51:42] they had but Caleb and Joshua had a
[51:45] positive attitude because they believed
[51:47] God and they went all the way through
[51:49] and received the promise because they
[51:52] did they they had a positive attitude
[51:53] even when all the spies came back from
[51:55] the land and ten of them gave a bad
[51:57] report Joe Joshua and Caleb had a
[52:02] positive report I've got this quote here
[52:07] I want to read it no sorry this is a
[52:10] scripture I just want to read this here
[52:11] put this one on your fridge if F our
[52:14] thought process is like this script the
[52:17] short scripture here will be the
[52:18] happiest the most positive people for
[52:20] full you might joy that you'd be
[52:22] like-minded having the same love being
[52:23] of one Accord of one mind let nothing be
[52:26] done through strife or vainglory but in
[52:28] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[52:30] better than themselves look not every
[52:32] man on his own things but every man also
[52:33] on the things of others let this mind be
[52:35] in you which was in Christ Jesus who
[52:36] being in the form of God thought of not
[52:38] robbery to be equal with God
[52:40] but made himself of no reputation and
[52:41] took upon him the form of a servant and
[52:43] was made in the likeness of men and
[52:45] being found in fashion as a man he
[52:46] humbled himself and became obedient to
[52:48] death even the death of the cross if you
[52:52] read through those if you just dissect
[52:55] all that and taking all those thought
[52:57] processes that are in here you'll be a
[52:59] very happy person then you'll be a very
[53:01] good Christian but now that's my point
[53:06] out these three things about our
[53:08] attitude the first one is we all have a
[53:11] free choice on what our attitude will be
[53:13] now this next point is a very important
[53:18] point in our Christian walk is that
[53:20] we're not judged on what we know about
[53:23] Christ and His Word but on our attitude
[53:26] towards what we know about Christ in his
[53:29] word and think about that one I'll cover
[53:32] that in a little bit and our spiritual
[53:33] outcome depends on our attitude towards
[53:35] the Word of God of course some quotes
[53:42] here to read brother MC somewhere you
[53:48] must show your life shows tonight where
[53:51] you are identified you are either
[53:53] identified in Christ or out of Christ
[53:54] you are not halfway there was no such
[53:57] thing as a drunk sober man there is no
[53:58] black white dude you're either saved or
[54:01] you're not saved
[54:01] you're a saint or a sinner one or the
[54:03] other and your spiritual attitude
[54:05] towards God's Word identifies you
[54:07] exactly where you're standing your
[54:10] spiritual attitude we take towards the
[54:12] Word of God never going out go into more
[54:13] of a spiritual aspect your spiritual
[54:14] attitude towards the Word of God shows
[54:16] who you are and it identifies you
[54:19] because if you really love the Lord your
[54:22] attitude towards the Lord into the
[54:23] things of the Lord towards his word is
[54:25] going to be reverent and pure and
[54:26] sincere that's going to be your attitude
[54:29] and it's going to reflect and how you
[54:31] act and what you do your attitude but if
[54:34] you're if you're just relaxed about the
[54:36] whole thing and not really too concerned
[54:37] about it then your attitude towards it
[54:40] it's going to be maybe or maybe I won't
[54:42] it's not really that big a deal it
[54:44] doesn't really matter maybe I've got
[54:46] other things to do this Sunday you know
[54:48] you know it's a is that but maybe God's
[54:50] not doesn't really care about that it's
[54:52] not really that important it's not
[54:53] you know it's it fix our attitude if you
[55:01] know the story of Ananias and Sapphira
[55:03] if you think about them this is going
[55:07] now to a negative attitude towards the
[55:09] Word of God they were a part of the
[55:13] believers in that time and maybe they
[55:17] maybe they heard of they'd heard of
[55:19] Jesus maybe they hadn't maybe they'd
[55:20] only meet Peter and maybe they were at
[55:22] the sermon where all the souls came in
[55:24] and were baptized and and they witness
[55:28] the Peter speaking in one language and
[55:30] all the other people from different
[55:32] countries hearing them in their own
[55:33] tongue and they were a part of all us
[55:34] maybe they were involved in all these
[55:36] things but somewhere even through this
[55:40] whole process it seems like they would
[55:42] they were kind of in into it but they
[55:44] were kind of they were like no but it's
[55:47] it's you know if it doesn't quite work
[55:48] out will God do something else
[55:50] no the attitude wasn't really sincere
[55:52] and and they were kind of I guess they
[55:55] were drawn unto thee maybe the emotion
[55:56] of it all in the way that it was all
[55:58] going and they were sort of caught up in
[56:01] it in a way but really they didn't
[56:02] really have the right attitude towards
[56:04] at all and maybe all their other friends
[56:07] were selling up their homes in giving to
[56:08] the the church so they thought well it
[56:10] seems to be what we're all doing at the
[56:12] moment we'll we'll sell our home too and
[56:15] give the money to the church you know
[56:16] but they couldn't quite see why they
[56:18] were thinking that's a bit of an extreme
[56:19] move though you know what if we what if
[56:21] it doesn't work out we're gonna eat me
[56:22] up with no home they say they always had
[56:25] this the attitude wasn't towards the
[56:28] Word of God and towards the things of
[56:30] Christ wasn't right it wasn't it wasn't
[56:32] fully hundred percent towards the things
[56:34] of the Lord they were mostly for the
[56:36] Lord with your attitude was and their
[56:38] thoughts were towards other things as
[56:40] well and so when they sold their home
[56:42] you can imagine them they were talking
[56:45] about it after the sale and thinking why
[56:48] don't we just keep let's just maybe we
[56:51] got 50,000 for let's just maybe keep 10
[56:53] grand and would just say be that we got
[56:57] 40 grand for it we'll keep the other 10
[56:58] just in case this whole thing doesn't
[56:59] work and you know we can we can go in
[57:02] that holiday you've always wanted you
[57:03] know now now
[57:06] we will you make a joke about it but
[57:08] they made light of it that's actually
[57:11] the way they would have thought was
[57:13] we'll keep some aside and they went and
[57:18] you can just adjust thinks of like
[57:20] insincere
[57:21] no no real reverence towards the things
[57:23] of God you know that's what that's what
[57:25] it seems like that they had and so
[57:28] Ananias went to Peter and he said here's
[57:31] my forty thousand I sold the house here
[57:34] praise the Lord we can you know the
[57:36] kingdom of God can be moved forward but
[57:38] Peter discerned something was wrong in
[57:47] the ass Peter why is Satan filled your
[57:49] heart that your life to the Holy Ghost
[57:51] no you see when your head the house
[57:53] wasn't at yours and then when you sold
[57:55] it the money was yours and yet you came
[57:58] here and you lied and you mate you made
[58:00] life of this whole thing you thought
[58:01] that ice it's you know it's not much in
[58:02] it he obviously wasn't that since he
[58:04] didn't think he was much in it you could
[58:05] just go and tell a lie think oh honey
[58:07] we'll just we'll say it's for this much
[58:08] and we'll just lie to these guys and you
[58:10] know they weren't know anything about it
[58:11] and when he realized he'd been found out
[58:14] the Bible says that he he was so stunned
[58:16] by it that he actually dropped dead and
[58:18] died and that in that moment because he
[58:21] had that he had the wrong attitude
[58:22] towards the whole thing and then his
[58:23] wife came in afterwards and Peter said
[58:25] did you sell the house for this much and
[58:27] she said y'all sold for this much and
[58:29] she had the same attitude to some and
[58:30] she died as well now God didn't really
[58:34] need the money
[58:35] he wasn't they weren't disappointed that
[58:38] uh now with ten thousand dollars short
[58:40] we we were going to sin Peter on this
[58:42] trip now we can't because you didn't
[58:43] give the ten thousand dollars God didn't
[58:44] want any of their money he didn't ki
[58:46] wouldn't care if they kept the house
[58:48] Peter said Peter said when it was it was
[58:51] your house you didn't have to sell it
[58:52] God wasn't interested in that was the
[58:55] attitude they're taken towards the
[58:56] things of God that were wrong the
[58:57] attitude was wrong and and it stem from
[59:01] the thought process they made light of
[59:03] the whole thing there was a negative
[59:05] attitude now go into a positive attitude
[59:10] and this is an interesting story but I
[59:13] wanted to bring this one up because it
[59:15] really doesn't matter what state we're
[59:16] in or how far we've come of all those
[59:18] sorts of things
[59:18] it's just
[59:19] attitude towards the Lord that really
[59:21] matters and we've go to the story of the
[59:24] Jesus on the cross with the two thieves
[59:27] either side and as they're all dying on
[59:31] the cross one of the thief's thieves has
[59:34] got it enough he's got enough in and to
[59:36] start railing on this other man on the
[59:38] cross next to him what an attitude it's
[59:42] like you're all they're dying men and
[59:43] you're going to now and you your last
[59:45] breath you're going to make fun of the
[59:48] guy next to you you know maybe maybe you
[59:51] should think of something nice to say
[59:52] and your last breath your last few hours
[59:54] of life and yet his attitude was so
[59:55] negative if you're the Son of God just
[59:58] think like like what these people think
[1:00:00] you out why don't you you know save
[1:00:02] yourself and save us in the process yeah
[1:00:05] what a bad attitude no wonder he was up
[1:00:09] on the cross he was probably like that
[1:00:10] in his life just negative attitude every
[1:00:12] rent and and I don't think he was really
[1:00:15] concerned that he was a thief I think he
[1:00:16] stole things and it didn't even prick
[1:00:18] his conscience that he stole he'd go and
[1:00:20] steal things steal off an old lady look
[1:00:22] what I got wouldn't think much of it
[1:00:24] seems like that sort of guy but there
[1:00:26] were two thieves on the cross and there
[1:00:28] was another thief there that was just as
[1:00:30] guilty and yet there was something in
[1:00:33] him a different attitude a different
[1:00:36] attitude now I don't know how many times
[1:00:39] how many sermons this guy had been to
[1:00:42] how many times had been to the synagogue
[1:00:43] obviously not many if he was a thief it
[1:00:46] didn't read about him you know I for an
[1:00:49] eye tooth for a tooth yeah what are the
[1:00:51] repercussions of a thief you know they
[1:00:53] would cut your arm off your hand off he
[1:00:55] obviously didn't study enough to find
[1:00:58] help and really take too much concern
[1:01:00] for it and yet he was actually concerned
[1:01:02] but he was just doing other things but
[1:01:05] when it really came down to it on the
[1:01:07] cross he actually had a different
[1:01:09] attitude and and even though he was
[1:01:15] still a thief he was still wrong he
[1:01:17] actually in that moment when the Lord
[1:01:20] was there he said he said to the other
[1:01:22] guy look look man I love this guy's
[1:01:25] attitude he said look man you and I are
[1:01:28] both thieves you know you're a thief I'm
[1:01:30] a thief we deserve to be up here
[1:01:33] but this man here he's not a thief maybe
[1:01:39] he was at the trial he was hearing what
[1:01:41] they were saying he's saying all they're
[1:01:43] accusing him of as I preached this and
[1:01:45] he did that but he's when you think
[1:01:47] about it he would have thought logically
[1:01:48] when you think about he's really done
[1:01:49] nothing wrong he is they didn't give any
[1:01:53] testimonies of he you know he stole or
[1:01:56] he hurt people or anything that they
[1:01:58] accused him of healing on the Sabbath
[1:01:59] day he's thinking hang on men there's
[1:02:02] nothing wrong with this guy leave him
[1:02:03] alone
[1:02:03] as attitude towards towards and the
[1:02:06] little that he knew his attitude towards
[1:02:08] him was different his attitude was
[1:02:10] different he said leave him alone and
[1:02:14] then he actually actually had enough of
[1:02:16] an attitude and them to say Lord when
[1:02:18] you go into your kingdom remember me
[1:02:19] maybe you would have thought to himself
[1:02:21] you know what I've got no other options
[1:02:23] I'm gonna be dead in a few hours maybe
[1:02:26] this is the son of God Lord remember me
[1:02:28] I don't think you do it as a back-up
[1:02:30] plan but maybe something came on him
[1:02:32] when he was drawing his last breath he
[1:02:34] said Lord remember me now he wasn't I
[1:02:38] wouldn't call him a profound Jew you
[1:02:43] know maybe he was Jewish but I wouldn't
[1:02:44] I wouldn't call him a very godly man and
[1:02:47] yet in that time all he had to do was
[1:02:48] have the right attitude towards Christ
[1:02:50] and he received mercy and the little
[1:02:52] that he knew he just had to have the
[1:02:54] right attitude and that was enough for
[1:02:55] him brother Branham says and he said in
[1:03:05] his Bible that he would judge the world
[1:03:07] by Jesus Christ and we read here that
[1:03:08] Jesus is the word and Hebrews 13:8 he's
[1:03:10] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:03:12] therefore he will judge the church by
[1:03:14] their attitude towards Christ who was
[1:03:16] the word notice he says attitude towards
[1:03:20] Christ he won't judge us by how much we
[1:03:24] know about Christ he will judge us by
[1:03:27] what we do with what we know with our
[1:03:29] attitude towards him because that makes
[1:03:31] it fair for everybody
[1:03:33] the thief all the thief knew was I think
[1:03:35] he's a good man
[1:03:36] there's nothing wrong with this man his
[1:03:37] attitude was he was judged by his
[1:03:39] attitude towards Christ
[1:03:42] so give an example of this
[1:03:46] young was David young David thinks mad I
[1:03:49] want to go and join the army in the US
[1:03:51] Army because I'm half American citizen
[1:03:55] some others American he thinks I want to
[1:03:57] join the army so so he maybe goes and
[1:04:02] runs in the bush and gets all army ready
[1:04:04] and then he applies for a replace
[1:04:07] through the Americans to join the army
[1:04:09] and he gets a letter back saying yeah
[1:04:10] you can join up to our army and so he
[1:04:12] starts pumping us wait so you think
[1:04:14] she's got to be tough to be in the army
[1:04:16] and he gets big muscles and everything
[1:04:19] in his foot he's ready to go and he
[1:04:21] signs up to the army and his attitude as
[1:04:23] man I want to be a good soldier I want
[1:04:25] to go out and wherever they say wherever
[1:04:27] they see me that's where I'll go I just
[1:04:29] want to serve well I want to be a good
[1:04:30] soldier I want to make my momma proud
[1:04:32] she doesn't want him to go but he wants
[1:04:36] to be a good soldier and so he turns up
[1:04:39] there and he's ready to go and he wakes
[1:04:40] up in the morning
[1:04:41] and then before he knows that here's
[1:04:43] this guy yelling in his face look at the
[1:04:45] state of your bed you think you're gonna
[1:04:47] be a soldier okay if he says make the
[1:04:57] bed good then I make the bed good knee
[1:04:59] makes the beard as tidy as he can then
[1:05:02] he realizes okay if that's the deal then
[1:05:04] every morning I wake up I'm gonna make
[1:05:05] this beard as tidy as I can cuz that's
[1:05:08] what my job is that I thought we would
[1:05:10] get gonna shoot guns and shoot
[1:05:12] everything but apparently not apparently
[1:05:13] I just have to make beards but hey he's
[1:05:16] the boss he's in charge I'm not I'm
[1:05:19] gonna make this beard the best I can
[1:05:20] every morning because that's what he
[1:05:22] asked me to do okay so that's this as
[1:05:25] far as he got with that one now we take
[1:05:28] another one he's maybe someone that's
[1:05:31] been in the Army for 30 years I like
[1:05:34] this I like these older pictures and see
[1:05:39] the general up here with on the horse
[1:05:41] maybe he's a faithful loyal general in
[1:05:43] peace he follows orders down to the T
[1:05:46] he's a he keeps his regiment and good
[1:05:49] condition he's he sound he's a sound man
[1:05:52] he's a temperate man the men respect him
[1:05:54] and he's a very good general and he's
[1:05:56] and maybe
[1:05:58] he's got to go and fight certain battles
[1:06:00] that he doesn't even know why he's there
[1:06:02] he's saying why we approach you from
[1:06:03] this side we should be on that side
[1:06:04] nonetheless they told me approach from
[1:06:06] this side they must have some plan that
[1:06:08] I don't know I approach from this side
[1:06:10] and he was faithful and loyal and maybe
[1:06:12] he'd won many battles and and and all
[1:06:14] the different facets of what it means to
[1:06:17] be a soldier he ticked all the boxes and
[1:06:18] he had the positive attitude had a
[1:06:20] positive attitude towards the name was a
[1:06:21] very good soldier and and he had a very
[1:06:24] good reputation
[1:06:26] now let's this look at this and we think
[1:06:28] okay let's say after one week of David
[1:06:31] being in the army and after 50 years of
[1:06:33] this guy being in the army and doing all
[1:06:35] these things let's say after Davis been
[1:06:38] in a week both these men David and this
[1:06:41] man and for some and some strange
[1:06:42] circumstances both died on the same day
[1:06:43] did
[1:06:45] now you think to yourself when you
[1:06:48] really ask the question you think who
[1:06:49] was the better soldier of these two when
[1:06:52] you really think about it who was the
[1:06:54] better soldier and you have to say they
[1:06:59] actually were both very good soldiers
[1:07:01] and neither one was better than the
[1:07:02] other they both had a positive attitude
[1:07:04] they were going to serve well the only
[1:07:07] difference was one man got more of an
[1:07:09] opportunity to and another one didn't
[1:07:11] but how can you say oh he was bitter
[1:07:13] because he did that well hang on if he'd
[1:07:15] have hit that much song he would have
[1:07:16] done that too you know and I say that
[1:07:20] about the young people you know it's
[1:07:21] actually if you're just starting up
[1:07:23] serving the Lord you're actually you see
[1:07:26] a net on that basis you're not any less
[1:07:29] maybe some of us have been down the road
[1:07:30] while so we've had to do other things
[1:07:31] and yet if your attitude towards the
[1:07:34] things of the Lord as Lord I'm going to
[1:07:35] serve you the best that I can and the
[1:07:37] Lord's eyes that is just as good as
[1:07:39] someone has been there a long time and
[1:07:41] you think wow they're animate they're an
[1:07:43] amazing Christian God doesn't see it
[1:07:45] like that he doesn't look at things like
[1:07:47] that that would be unfair to look at
[1:07:49] things like that he looks at it there so
[1:07:50] that's your attitude towards the Lord
[1:07:53] now see next year we grab it and we
[1:07:56] change we think man I was well I can't
[1:07:59] believe I did that back then and yet
[1:08:00] back then that was all we knew and
[1:08:01] that's what we did
[1:08:02] so don't young people don't ever feel
[1:08:05] discouraged that you're actually on the
[1:08:07] Lord's eyes what you have to do is
[1:08:08] actually have to have a positive
[1:08:10] attitude
[1:08:12] the right attitude towards the Lord and
[1:08:13] that's actually all you've got to do you
[1:08:17] know and then you just walk in the light
[1:08:18] that he shows you I'm gonna skip this
[1:08:23] now do it real quick I'm just gonna rush
[1:08:26] through this now I'm gonna be finished
[1:08:27] soon this is just this is just a play
[1:08:31] out to go on forward with that concept
[1:08:32] for a little bit you could have two
[1:08:34] people they could do the same Sun and
[1:08:37] once right and ones wrong on this with
[1:08:40] the same sort of basis and that's
[1:08:43] because one person's attitude is I don't
[1:08:45] care and the other person's attitude is
[1:08:49] I do care I just failed see it's their
[1:08:52] attitude they did the same thing and yet
[1:08:54] one was right when the outcome of both
[1:08:56] was right and wrong that's your attitude
[1:08:59] and you know what if you have always got
[1:09:03] that attitude lord I do care I just
[1:09:04] failed the Lord will always forgive you
[1:09:08] always you could do the same sin this
[1:09:11] may sound extreme but you could do the
[1:09:13] same sin every day of your life till you
[1:09:15] die and you'll still be perfect the Lord
[1:09:18] wants after 20 years saying it's been 20
[1:09:20] years now I think and this is the 1300
[1:09:23] time you've done that I've had a bit of
[1:09:25] I've had enough of this I think no I'm
[1:09:27] not going to forgive you this time you
[1:09:30] see cuz he tells us we say the disciple
[1:09:32] said Lord how long should we forgive our
[1:09:33] brother he said 70 issue we forgive him
[1:09:36] this many times he says seventy times
[1:09:38] seven and a day you know and if he tells
[1:09:42] us you forgive him this bit almost
[1:09:44] seemed like infinite then how could he
[1:09:46] turn around in and not give us the same
[1:09:48] deal
[1:09:49] you see it's our attitude but if our
[1:09:51] attitude ever changed well I don't
[1:09:53] really care that's different because now
[1:09:56] our attitude is wrong yeah attitude is
[1:09:58] wrong it's their attitude that makes all
[1:10:00] the difference in our walk with the Lord
[1:10:01] now I want to show you this one here
[1:10:04] because this is along the same lines
[1:10:05] that if God will judge you by what your
[1:10:08] attitude was to Christ and His Word then
[1:10:10] he will also reward you by what your
[1:10:11] attitude was to Christ in his word your
[1:10:14] attitude and and the reward because you
[1:10:17] know there's a reward for the believers
[1:10:19] the reward is not based on the amount of
[1:10:21] what you did but the true value of what
[1:10:24] you did
[1:10:25] and and I couldn't think of another word
[1:10:27] to just to think of what the true value
[1:10:29] was but it's along the lines of what
[1:10:31] we're talking about it was a story and
[1:10:33] it's the concept is and this story here
[1:10:36] with us with the widow woman and brought
[1:10:41] Jesus is sitting down near the synagogue
[1:10:43] at one day with the with his disciples
[1:10:46] and they're watching the priests and the
[1:10:50] different believers and different people
[1:10:51] throwing in money into the offering box
[1:10:54] at the synagogue giving me paying their
[1:10:57] tithe to the Lord and then that what a
[1:10:58] woman comes up and she puts in it she
[1:11:01] puts in two mites which is next to
[1:11:03] nothing and Jesus points out to this
[1:11:09] this woman and he points to the
[1:11:13] situation and he said to her I want to
[1:11:16] tell you something about what's just
[1:11:17] happened over here that woman there that
[1:11:20] throwing the two mites has thrown and
[1:11:22] more than all the other people he
[1:11:25] actually said all the other people put
[1:11:26] together she's thrown and more because
[1:11:31] she said the other people that through
[1:11:32] their money and they had they hit they
[1:11:34] just threw it out of the earth they had
[1:11:36] a hundred they had five hundred they
[1:11:38] threw and twenty they still hit or they
[1:11:40] threw an hundred they still had 400 left
[1:11:42] it wasn't really a big deal to them they
[1:11:46] but she only had two mites she Jesus
[1:11:49] said she threw an offer want meaning she
[1:11:51] was actually already a negative she
[1:11:53] didn't have any to hardly begin with and
[1:11:54] that was all she had she probably had to
[1:11:56] pay bills with it you know that was all
[1:11:58] she had she's thrown off who want she
[1:12:01] put that in now the difference in these
[1:12:03] two was attitude I think you'll find
[1:12:05] that these these people that's
[1:12:06] throughout $100 if he only had five
[1:12:08] hundred dollars in the air bills to pay
[1:12:09] of one thousand he would not have put
[1:12:11] their 500 dollars in no way he wouldn't
[1:12:14] even probably wouldn't have put the $100
[1:12:15] and because his attitude was like well I
[1:12:18] don't really believe it this much to do
[1:12:20] it and yet who attitude was Lord this is
[1:12:24] all I've got but I'm gonna give it to
[1:12:25] you and look if you reward me or
[1:12:27] whatever I'm just gonna give it to you
[1:12:29] and just move on because I've I just
[1:12:31] want to go one thing I want to I want to
[1:12:33] give to your kingdom at least maybe your
[1:12:34] Foudy very else in life I would I got
[1:12:36] this
[1:12:36] - now everything else is foul but at
[1:12:38] least I can do this for you at least all
[1:12:40] I can do something and walk away
[1:12:41] thinking you know what at least the Lord
[1:12:43] will benefit us in a small way from my
[1:12:44] life you know it was your attitude was
[1:12:47] different now it's not the amount of
[1:12:52] what we do it's our attitude and I want
[1:12:56] to show you yet this may be too small
[1:12:57] for you to read but we'll just do a few
[1:13:00] more quotes and then we're done
[1:13:02] Matthew 5 verse 1 says in this is a
[1:13:05] Sermon on the Mount Jesus says blessed
[1:13:09] are the poor in spirit for these is the
[1:13:11] kingdom of heaven blessed are they that
[1:13:13] mourn for they shall be comforted
[1:13:15] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:13:17] inherit the earth blessed are they which
[1:13:19] hangar and thirst after righteousness
[1:13:20] for they shall be filled
[1:13:22] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:13:23] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[1:13:26] heart for they shall see God blessed are
[1:13:29] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[1:13:30] the children of God blessed are they
[1:13:32] which are persecuted for righteousness
[1:13:33] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:13:36] blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:13:38] you and persecute and shall say all
[1:13:39] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:13:41] my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:13:43] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:13:45] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:13:47] were before you now I want you to look
[1:13:49] at those scriptures those scriptures are
[1:13:52] not about doing a single thing you if
[1:13:56] you do all those scriptures you're going
[1:13:58] to end up with a whole kingdom and so
[1:14:00] much of a reward you love the earth
[1:14:01] you'll end up with everything and yet
[1:14:04] that doesn't say you have to do a single
[1:14:06] thing it's all about attitude it's all
[1:14:10] about attitude blessed are the poor in
[1:14:13] spirit that's an attitude lord I can't
[1:14:15] but you can bless of the day that
[1:14:19] mourned you know blessed are the meek
[1:14:22] Lord on the humble people Lord I just
[1:14:25] blessed are they which hangar and thirst
[1:14:27] after righteousness blessed are the
[1:14:28] merciful Lord you've shown mercy on me I
[1:14:31] want to show mercy upon others you see
[1:14:33] there's going to be many a poor widow
[1:14:36] woman that are going to be far wealthier
[1:14:37] and heaven then someone that's done all
[1:14:41] these wonderful things and I'm glad the
[1:14:44] Lord's made it like this that our reward
[1:14:46] is not based on what we do it's actually
[1:14:48] based on our attitude
[1:14:50] it's on an attitude towards what we do
[1:14:52] because then it makes it a level playing
[1:14:55] field because we can all determine our
[1:14:56] own attitude and all of these things
[1:14:59] the reward is based on our attitude how
[1:15:01] we react how we do things
[1:15:04] you know you think well I'll never go up
[1:15:06] and preach I'll never do this I'll never
[1:15:08] do that they actually it doesn't say
[1:15:10] after blesses other preachers they shall
[1:15:12] inherit the earth blessed are they that
[1:15:13] do all these things it actually doesn't
[1:15:15] say that it's got to be a fair playing
[1:15:17] field it's got to be fair you might
[1:15:20] think you have achieved you might say
[1:15:22] look I haven't had to did anyone leave
[1:15:23] no one to the Lord of my entire life but
[1:15:26] yet if you know your heart Lord I've
[1:15:27] been faithful wherever you've called me
[1:15:29] I've gone I've done this you know when I
[1:15:30] felt to bring someone something I
[1:15:33] brought it to them you know you if you
[1:15:35] can learn your deathbed and think Lord
[1:15:37] when you called answers and I went and
[1:15:38] and I had the right attitude you know
[1:15:40] and I always tried to keep peace where I
[1:15:42] went and all these things you've got a
[1:15:44] massive reward waiting for you according
[1:15:46] to these scriptures based on your
[1:15:48] attitude not based on what you do not
[1:15:50] based on your achievements and and that
[1:15:54] should be encouraging to whichever part
[1:15:57] of the body you find yourself in it's a
[1:15:59] level playing field it's fear and I'm so
[1:16:02] glad the Lord's fear I used to think you
[1:16:04] know if you do more you get more but
[1:16:05] doesn't work like that it doesn't
[1:16:07] actually work like that it's attitude
[1:16:11] now just I'll just read these three more
[1:16:13] quotes as an open I'm closing and I go
[1:16:16] on record and I say this about the Word
[1:16:17] of God being a seed if you can take the
[1:16:19] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:16:21] promise of God he will bring it to pass
[1:16:23] for other p.m. said I'm gonna go on
[1:16:25] record here quote this he's saying quote
[1:16:29] this if you can take the right mental
[1:16:32] attitude towards any promit divine
[1:16:34] promise of God he'll bring it to pass if
[1:16:38] we can have the right attitude it will
[1:16:39] happen the way the Bible said it would
[1:16:41] happen let's skip that one
[1:16:48] two more what does that the quickening
[1:16:52] power come into the church making here
[1:16:53] already in this hour that we're
[1:16:54] approaching quickening power oh god help
[1:16:56] us to receive it help us to believe it
[1:16:57] see it depends on what attitude you take
[1:17:00] to it whether it's going to do you any
[1:17:02] good or not though you won't have to
[1:17:04] believe that if you don't believe it it
[1:17:07] won't do you one bit of good all of this
[1:17:10] depends on what attitude we take towards
[1:17:12] it one more and the Gentiles are called
[1:17:20] out the bride's really the rapture is at
[1:17:22] hand can we realize that can we actually
[1:17:23] believe that is it a story that's been
[1:17:27] told as that a myth to us is it
[1:17:28] something that sounds real is it
[1:17:30] something that we can that we outside
[1:17:32] can believe or is it something this and
[1:17:33] us that's part of us that it's more than
[1:17:35] life to us what attitude do we sit in
[1:17:38] this morning in this Tabernacle remember
[1:17:40] it'll be a small flock that receives it
[1:17:42] what attitude have we got towards what
[1:17:45] we've heard Peter had the right attitude
[1:17:49] when everyone was leaving Jesus said a
[1:17:52] few things that sounded to put it in our
[1:17:56] terms we would understand crazy unless
[1:17:58] you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:18:00] you've got no life in you suddenly they
[1:18:02] weren't inviting him back to preach you
[1:18:04] know you think about it put yourself in
[1:18:06] that time and even Peter himself didn't
[1:18:08] understand what was going on and yet
[1:18:10] when Jesus said to him will you go also
[1:18:12] what was his attitude his thought
[1:18:15] process was look I don't understand what
[1:18:17] you're talking about but there's
[1:18:19] something in you there's something about
[1:18:21] you this is what he's thinking there's
[1:18:23] something about you that that's that's
[1:18:26] more than all this even though I don't
[1:18:27] understand it
[1:18:28] I'm gonna follow you but I haven't found
[1:18:31] there's something about you that I
[1:18:33] haven't found anywhere else and he said
[1:18:35] Lord to whom shall we go you alone his
[1:18:37] the words of eternal life his attitude
[1:18:40] was Lord doesn't make sometimes doesn't
[1:18:42] make sense to me but I'm going to follow
[1:18:44] anyway because these are something in it
[1:18:47] amen and that's
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:53] that's what a believers attitude as
[1:18:55] towards Christ one of the prerequisites
[1:18:58] for being a disciple he said unless you
[1:19:01] forsake all and follow me you cannot be
[1:19:03] my disciple
[1:19:03] we added you when you forsake all your
[1:19:06] attitude as the Lord you're in charge
[1:19:08] what are we doing what you say goes
[1:19:10] that's our attitude whatever you say
[1:19:12] goes if you say this I did this if you
[1:19:15] say that I do that you say don't do this
[1:19:16] I don't do that you say do this I'll do
[1:19:18] that
[1:19:18] you're in charge not me I've forsaken
[1:19:20] all that's our attitude and unless we
[1:19:23] have their attitude we actually cannot
[1:19:25] be his disciple that's not my words
[1:19:27] that's just the way the Lord has said it
[1:19:29] when we have that attitude though the
[1:19:31] whole of the kingdom of God is open to
[1:19:33] us that's actually the key having the
[1:19:35] right attitude that's the key having
[1:19:38] their attitude towards the Lord as the
[1:19:40] key to the door it opens up everything
[1:19:41] and we we enjoy everything the Lord has
[1:19:44] for us when we have the right attitude
[1:19:45] towards the Lord Lord I surrender all
[1:19:48] and I'm gonna just do the best that I
[1:19:51] can I'm gonna do everything you say I'm
[1:19:52] just gonna follow you as much as I can
[1:19:54] whether yeah this big
[1:19:55] well that big it doesn't matter if you
[1:19:58] have that attitude you're on the same
[1:19:59] lip it's a level playing for the you're
[1:20:01] at the same place as everyone else even
[1:20:03] if you're like that it kinda goes like
[1:20:04] that it doesn't matter
[1:20:05] young people old people old people
[1:20:07] aren't better than younger people know
[1:20:09] if their attitude is like this and
[1:20:10] someone's attitudes like that young or
[1:20:12] old it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:20:14] and the Lord's eyes that everyone's the
[1:20:15] same like that you mean let's um let's
