praise the Lord I know that's all our desires amen that we want to serve Him we want to have the right spirit to do it amen amen how many enjoyed the meal amen well how many enjoyed the meal hey man I know when you're too full you're too full to answer right all right but we just appreciate it to appreciate those who put it together god bless you and amen it's just been a wonderful time and I know it's been special for you and I trust that these meetings have been special for you and that God has put something eternal in your life a man that the enemy will never take from you amen amen I mean raise their hand and say he's done that for me praise the Lord and well let's just bow our heads well before we bow our heads actually we're going to do something just to make this a little bit special this is this is a different kind of service and we just want to spend a little bit time to talk to you so if if our sister I don't need the music anymore because I'm gonna sing acapella how many like acapella well that don't make me feel good however two or three people all right anyway all right I'm gonna get this figured out here comes the bride all dressed in black and brown amen we're gonna do something a little special for you tonight let's not do it catty corner to stand right in the middle like it's the first time this is their 20th wedding I almost said dedication anniversary amen give him a hand Anna and we thought about they were going to do it on Wednesday but I thought it would be nice just to do it here tonight and you all can be witnesses hey man so we appreciate brother RA and sister pillar and it's a privilege to be able to do your dedication amen tonight and I dedication anniversary everybody look at one another and say lord help brother Danny tonight because I needed it okay I want to tell you something and the reason I wanted to do this this way this evening is because I want to tell you something special because every couple that gets married in Christian marriage is a reflection of the heart of God God has made a commitment to you and when did you begin to love pillow okay let's not go let's see these guys all right when did you know that you loved her that's that's pretty yeah yeah good that's better in married 20 years and begin to love her in 2007 so we des had a problem there I want to tell you something about God you know God never began to love you never he always has right God could not begin to love you he's always loved you because he loved you you can love him now we love him because he first loved us so he never he never began to love you he's always loved you but then he don't force you into a marriage with him he winds you he winds you as a scripture says I will allure her he lured you he won you to himself and then it says in the Book of Psalms I will make them willing in the day of my power so God used his influence on you just like these meetings to influence your mind to influence your heart that you would willingly make a decision to say yes Lord I'm gonna marry you and this is only a reflection of an eternal desire and he can only love her right because God has loved him right and when that eternal love comes into them that's why brother Branham says when when a brother and a sister and when a man and a woman because brother and sister not sound good when it comes to marriage a man when a man and woman love one another he said that's a love that comes from God they said they just stepped out of eternity aiming on into time and they're going to go back to eternity again amen eternal together then how is that not a reflection of God he loved you so much that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life and you know who the whosoever is the whosoever is not everybody because the Bible says that he came to save his children and he knew who whosoever would he knew amen that you would be one in the day of his power just when you felt the power of God move into the building it began to win your heart and influence the way you were thinking you saw him in a different way you didn't see him as a father that was standing off somewhere and didn't didn't care for you and impersonal God that's not our God can you say man it's a god that wanted to win you at the at the heart level he won you at your heart level he's not an impersonal God he's a God that accepts the obligation of taking your care into his his his care he takes that upon himself amen he don't look at you with eyes of flames of fire hey man what did the book of Song of Solomon say that his eyes are like the eyes of a raven and of a dove and so forth and goes on that's not the eyes of a flame of fire looking in on judgment that's the eyes of love and God cannot get you any other way than love and love is not the love that the world thinks of we don't serve a sentimental Jesus this is not a weak love this is a love that trends in sin it transcends the lowest that can go to the lowest and lift them higher than they ever thought they couldn't be lifted when they thought it was over then he lifted them up love lifted me he say men Amen so God Amen this is a this is a this is a boy there I go again yeah it's a reflection it's their anniversary it's a redoing their vows but my mind I shouldn't have ate but God is doing this to you constantly they're reaffirming their love tonight their commitment will to one another God is constantly reconfirming his commitment to you why can't I love him back why can't I love him back what kind of love is that so we love the Lord we want to spend this time now we want to we want to do their vows again if you turn and face one another take one another's hands see we're just getting you young people ready hallelujah and when I tell you you're going to do it do it right do it right hey man let's bow our heads for word of Prayer because I don't have to ask who gives this woman to this man so a man that's been done large with joyful hearts and thankfulness Lord we join ourselves together now with this couple to reaffirm their vows thanking you Lord for 20 years of marriage that is now stronger than it's ever been and I think they can both say Lord that they love one each other now more than they ever have a stronger love a deeper love a deeper commitment and they just want to take this moment this pause to honor you for 20 years and to say thank you thank you for your Providence thank you for your hand of mercy your hand of guidance perhaps when their marriage went through troubled times Lourdes you still are counselor you're still the Prince of Peace you still call them the troubled storms you're the same yesterday today and forever we pray Lord now as we do this that you would bless this large reaffirmation large your blessed this blessed is the time that would last Lord surely we we look around we feel that it's a short time but we don't know lor but all the time that we have left all the time they have left may you honor them and may they honor you may their love be submitted stronger than ever and may you bless them as as they pasture and lead the little church there in Stratford father we ask these things in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord the Bible says whatsoever God has joined together let no man put asunder do you all right take pillow to be your wife to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony we love her comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health for richer for poorer for better for worse and sadness and in joy to cherish and continually bestow upon her your heart's deepest devotion forsaking all others keep yourself only unto her as long as you both shall live amen so look at her and say yeah Amen see they're acting just like newlyweds because they all turn and look at me to a man I love it do you pillow take all right to be your husband to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony will you love him comfort him honor and keep him in sickness and in health for richer for poorer for better for worse and sadness and in joy to cherish and continually bestow upon him your heart's deepest devotion forsaking all others keep yourself only unto Him as long as you both shall live amen amen let's bow our heads one more time Lord Jesus we've witnessed this consecration of vows again we thank you for it Lord we pray your Blessed brother all rain sister pillow Lord as they go forward unless their little family we pray we thank you for this Lord example that is stood before us I know there's people in this room that love them and I pray father they're always Lord be an example of your love we pronounce this blessing upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the authority of the word of God I pronounce you man and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ again and then you may now shake hands man praise the Lord Amen do you love the Lord bless you we certainly have enjoyed our time here with you all it's been a real privilege of mine to be able to come and be with you and I appreciate your attentiveness in the services and I pray that Lord will always bless you for it we could be out doing something else we could be running after the things that we wanted to do as I look upon you I'm seeing young people that already many are at the age where they've went young people have went into the military they're being used to further a country's interests and if they can be taught and they can be trained to act a certain way and then this is no different for us in the sense we also are in a war we also are in a fight amen and God takes young people and he trains them amen he trains them I tell you have an experience with God last night and maybe said there's a question in your mind what's next now what do I do have I done everything I can do maybe you've repented you've done everything that you can well let me tell you God is faithful what happens is you're going to leave here you're going to get away from one another you're going to get away from the fellowship the atmosphere is going to change you're going to go back to life you're going to begin rubbing shoulders again with the world because we can't avoid that and sometimes when you begin to take a ember out of a fire and you begin to move it away from all the other embers what happens to that Ember begins to die down you have to do something to keep the flame burning amen you just don't be a camp-meeting Christian go from camp meeting to camp meeting reaffirming your dedication to the Lord asking God to forgive you living at the altar service after service not sure if God has saved you but I want to tell you amen Jesus Christ for every believer in this room is your personal property he is our example he has not left us without resources he has taught us to believe the word and he's taught us how to speak and I want to I want to read you a scripture out of Romans 15 this is I just love this scripture and I want you to take this home with you and I have 28 minutes and 35 seconds to get this done to the to the desert everybody say desert all right what is it do you but brother Armand do you like desert okay all right this is Romans 15 and 13 says now that god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing can I say that again may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Spirit now I want you to think of that for a minute of what the power of the Holy Spirit will do in your life because we look at the power of the Holy Spirit many times as a rabbit's foot it's something that's a lucky charm it's going to keep us from trouble it's a force field where nothing can go wrong I I won't feel temptation again if I really had an experience with God I won't have these things try to come back in well you better believe everything that you first sucked in these meetings Satan is going to test that experience to see if you meant business with God I want to make this statement and if I make it to again tomorrow it's because I want to drive it home brother Branham said in the message of believers contest he said that Satan studies your strategy with the word he's watching you he saw you at the altar he saw you pray and he saw you asking God to fill you fill you with the Holy Ghost how many asked ask God to fill you with the Holy Ghost no never be ashamed of that don't never be ashamed of it before your friends don't never be ashamed of it before in the world don't never be ashamed to give a reason of the hope that lies within you they may mock you they may make fun of you but don't be ashamed of it because deep down on the inside there's something in them wandering and the only way they can protect himself from that question is to mock it because there's a void that is being filled with something else and brother Bentham said and and I would say this tonight is everybody is filled with something nobody can be filled with nothing you're filled with something tonight don't never be ashamed of what God has done for you and don't ever lose hope in it don't feel like that every time Amen you made a mistake or something goes wrong and and the devil traps you in your thoughts that you've got to go back and start all over again this is a commitment like this merit this this commitment that they've made they've made mistakes in their marriage raised their hands if you have have you made mistakes I mean I'm not talking about moral faults or any I'm not I'm not even going down that road but we're human how many humans we have in here I don't see anybody with any any screws a man that's joining their joints together and your clankers your walk you're all human your flesh and blood your grass your something that the wind blows upon and it can be movable Amen so we make mistakes but Amen because we make mistakes don't mean we give up on our commitments did you hear the vowel that was read amen in sickness and in health for better or for worse God would never give us a vow that he wouldn't keep himself God made a vow to you that even when you believe not I will remain faithful when Israel went off like an adulterous woman God said I will win her back the redemptive love of God was shown in Adam when his wife had fallen in adultery all right and she should have been burned amen he was God of the earth he was ruling the earth from heaven because heaven had told him be a son of God on the earth and he was ruling the earth as God would rule the earth and his last act as God was to step out and take his wife back that was his last act as God and then he lost everything but you know why he stepped out for her anybody want to tell me no none of the adults you don't eat all your food you're supposed to anyway yes because he loved her you know what that's all he could say it's the only reason I'm stepping out for her is I love her too much to let her be burnt so brother Branham said he took her quickly to himself in order that she would not be lost and when he took her to himself he became in a fallen condition he knew exactly what he was doing Eve didn't know she was deceived but Adam knew exactly why he did what he did and all they could say is I loved her and here is a man who had creative power in him he could walk on the water he could he named the animals he didn't name them by the way he looked he named him for the essence that was in him he knew their nature he controlled everything around him as perfect control God had placed him there in dominion and then he lost all of it he turned a perfect place into a waste howling desert into a man instead of a Garden of Eden death set in that's what a man's love did amen and God looked at that and said there's a shadow of God in that and he took a lamb and he wrapped the lamb around them and they were covered in lambs blood of lamb skin and blood running down their legs and he took him told him to leave the garden and they go out and he said there is a shadow of what I will do for my children let me tell you God has reaffirmed and reaffirmed his love for you through every generation Calvary showed that God meant business with what he said and I'll never let my word fall to the ground but if I called you and you were in my mind you cannot help begin to feel that love beat in your heart beginning to beat back to God right now and say God I love you I don't understand it well he's just pulling you because he brought you in this hour and the only way you can really recognize God because this ain't a soap opera it's not a love story like the world thinks of I mean this is the love of God how rich and pure and the only thing that could wake you up is the message of the hour the message of the hour is the love of God it was not William branham's idea it wasn't a fable that he put together said I want to write a life story and hope the people enjoy it and their believe I'm a prophet no God I mean let me tell you a man who is the most important person on the face of the earth Elisha are the people he sent to behold I said do you know how many believe brother Beneful fills Malachi four and five well how many believe that you fulfill malachi four and five behold i send you elijah the prophet you are as much a part of that scripture as he is and brother Branham was the messenger of God to tell you the king means business with you he's calling you to himself let me tell you you're an ester you've been raised for this time you bet you've come for such a time as this God needs young people God needs young people to reflect him in this hour because the other young people don't want to reflect him they want to run after the games and they want to run after the parties and they want to run after their friends and they all want to sell them assimilate together and all be alike and if their friends smoke they want to smoke if their friends drink they want to drink i'ma tell you it's easy to live a life of sin all you do is just give away the things because you're already in that condition the lusts of the flesh is going after it but when God comes in you made that hard choice to follow him amen God said I'll meet that commitment I won't meet it halfway I'll go all the way with you you made a commitment last night some of you may go out and forget about it god I'll never forget it because he said it's for better for worse it's in sickness and in health it's for richer or for poorer you know you know you just imagine you may be poor support and that you know you've married the richest husband in the world you know your husband owns a cattle on a Thousand Hills how many ever wonder how many of you girls want to marry a rich husband well he's oh is he rich Oh stand up stand up here we got they've got to use this come on sister Chantel now I'll say it again did you want to make you wonder marry rich husband and he's not rich is he but can I give you guys a word of advice if anybody asked you when you're married if anybody asks you about your husband is he rich or is he this don't ever go oh because that makes him feel like he's not rich he's rich he's very rich he's richer than a bank account sorry sister I took you right in the wrong direction didn't I amen but you know we're trying to help him he don't he don't eat the food he should and everything we want him to be healthy when he's 40 amen you can be you can be seated he's rich may not be rich in houses and lands when you have a God that is inside of you you're rich because it carries you through every Valley I'm tell you we have a faithful God I'm not even going to say what I was going to say tonight I'm going to say it in the morning if I don't say it in the morning I'll tell it to my church amen but a man I want to tell you how faithful your God is your God will never leave you David said I've been young and now I'm old I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread there'll be times you feel like the anointing is not on you you know amen David did not expect to be anointed that evening when Samuel came to the house in fact David was not even invited he was out in the field with the Sheep he must have lived in New Zealand all right he was out in the field with the Sheep is his father never invited him into the to the meeting with the Prophet he had other sons there that when they said we're looking for a king to anoint he did not think of David David was the last one and you're the last ones amen and everyone Samuel a prophet looked at these boys and said surely this is God's King and God said that's not him for I don't look upon that the person like men do I look upon their heart and he came all the way down to the end and in God had refused all them boys and and and and he said do you have another and he says yes and they called Dave and brought him in and God said this is the Lord's anointed and he anointed him there in the presence of his family and he was anointed and brother Graham said as a type of the Holy Spirit come to him amen and right then he was persistently placed when the Holy Spirit comes to your life you are persistently placed in the kingdom of God and he was persistently placed as king even though another King said on the throne God had persistently placed David as king he had called him he had anointed him and he had placed him and he went out and he fought a giant and that giant was defeated when nobody else could do it this boy stepped up and he didn't go there to kill a giant you understand he was just going about his daily duty of obeying what his father did and let me tell you're going to go home and you may not even be aware there's a giant awaiting for you around the corner but God has equipped you brother BAM said anybody that come he brings his seeds of God in that age they are equipped to meet the challenge of that age a man you are equipped to meet the challenge of this godless sinful Laodicean soft age that the people don't even seem fit to live in technology's gone too fast to keep up with but you are equipped to do it how by the Holy Spirit that is in you equips you to meet the challenge and you don't even know what the challenge is David didn't know that there would be a giant lassies kid what was he carrying he was carrying bread and cheese to his brothers he likes but do you like cheese see you like bread he can be a David yeah we're working you out amen hey man and he's carrying bread and cheese and he's gonna fight a giant you may be goner with your school book under your arm yeah you didn't know you're gonna fight a giant that day you weren't even prepared to fight a giant but all it took was a giant's voice to hit the ear of a scene of gods give me a man and who stood up a boy just come out of the New Zealand youth camping he was so fire for God in it that struck that has struck him and said I can't stand to see God mock like that I'm gonna be a witness said Amen he's the same yesterday today and forever God is challenging every one of you God is not here to condemn you many times our idea of God is a wrong idea you understand there's a story in the Bible that that the master a nobleman he gave a talents to three of his servants amen to one he gave more to another he gave a little bit lesson to another he gave one and when he came back after he's gone for a long journey and he came back amen the one that he gave more had produced a double of what he had given him the other I produced more but the third one that took what he'd given him and wrapped it up in a napkin and hid it in the ground and what was his excuse when he asked him why did you not give this at least to the usery so it bring forth something back from it he said is because I knew you were a hard man and many times your idea of God is somebody that's hard and condemning and unjust let me tell you God hates sin but God don't hate sin and just to hate you he doesn't hate you he hates in effect upon your life because you're called to live so much higher than what sin could do to you understand you can have a full ambition in your life and go out and make yourself a successful businessman Esau was a successful businessman but he turned down the birthright I mean you can do all of those things and live far below your god-given privilege you could be you could be what brother Armand is not rich tonight I'm not rich either so I just want to help you most I mean your family amen but that's not amen the goal amen the highest form of life is not a human being the highest form of life is a human being who has a Holy Ghost living inside of them and you with the Holy Spirit living in you will transcend anything you've ever thought you could think or do God in order for you to to live the fullest and the highest may lower your standard of living he may lower your dreams because he's got a goal in mind he's got a target he's hitting it was we talked about last night about amen and children are arrows and a Quivers I mean they're supposed to be aimed by the parents appointed at a target well don't you think God does that with his children he aims you at a target brother Ram said that the bride of this age will will overcome Satan and face-to-face confrontation with the enemy she will prove she is not like that first Eve that she can believe the word that has been given to her and live by it Amen Christ is not let me just tell you the difference Amen in a marriage the differences of marriages you can have a husband and a wife and there what husband and wife can be part of their life that's a miserable marriage my husband is a part of my life my wife is a part of my life that's a miserable marriage but Paul said Christ who is our life when Christ is your life he's everything don't you dare leave this camp scared that you're going to fall don't you even entertain those thoughts yeah let me just say it this way don't even worry about it imma if you haven't figured it out I'm a long ways from home you know how you can tell I don't talk like you right say Amen amen hey man I don't say Amen like it I say I say man you guys got Eggman [Music] we're from a law we're a long ways way I'm a far is it to the US eight thousand miles that's a year yeah probably huh pretty sure there's no I'm pretty sure that another brand preach future home he didn't use kilometers a man that's a good thought in it you know I'm a long ways from home but my wife didn't leave me because I'm a long ways from home when I get back my wife is there my house is there my children their families are there I don't lose my family because I'm a long ways off we have an understanding we have a connection brother branham said brother branham said that when I go away I don't I don't I don't go go to my wife and say now now mrs. Brennan while I'm gone bow shall not go out with any other man while I'm gone do you hear me and sister Brandon would go and now William I'm pretty sure if William would have done that what you just did it would have been a lot different when you are gone you shall not go out with any other woman look strange talking like you said what kind of marriage is that there's no trust see you got to trust God we read you that scripture amen that the god of Hope now brother Brown said that hope is the greatest enemy of faith there is but that's not the hope God is talking about the hope brother branham is talking about is the worldly hope where they just wish it happens this hope he's talking about as expectation expectation is a different thing expectation calls the house of Cornelius to be filled with the Holy Ghost as they heard the word come on so may the god of expectation fill you with all joy and hope in believing through the power of the Holy Ghost we think of the power of the Holy Ghost is doing all these mighty miracles everything know the power of the Holy Ghost come and give you joy and hope and believing that's trust I'm trusting God no matter if my life journey goes backwards you know you may be preparing you may be preparing to be the best businessman the best nurse I don't know where you're at in your life cuz again I'm from 8000 miles away I don't know where you're at but life can take a turn that you don't count for it took a turn in David's life here is the king he knows he's anointed he's going in that anointing he's raised a Giants head blood running down his arm and the armies of the Philistines screaming in terror running for their lives and he takes it up to Jerusalem he hears everybody's singing Saul has killed his thousands but david has killed his ten thousands David found on top of the world until Saul was anointed with an evil spirit and begin to chase after David to take his life and now David is caught between Israel and between the Philistines and he's running for his life and one day he comes he comes in two he comes in he don't have a weapon he don't have no food he's on the run and he's still the king he's still anointed but he just don't feel anoint it I've got five more minutes to finish this out he doesn't feel anointed and he's on the run and he comes to the city of Nob and he goes in there and he asks the priests he said we need bread we it and so forth and the priest goes through the qualifications have your men been with women and everything in the last wall and David said that no they they qualified out so they gave him food he knows do you have a weapon he goes all I have is the sword of Goliath now David is on the run he stretched out his nerves are shredded where's the anointing now where's the feeling of of the youth camp now and the priest said all we have is this sword of Goliath behind the ephod there was something hidden nobody else could see it was a sword David said that's a good one you know God lays memories that opportune times in your life to remind you he's faithful and that he still the victorious God and I trust that in your dark hour there come a memory of this time because this hour was your victory victory in Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me ere I knew him and all my life is due him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood do you believe he did that for you and he pulled that sword out and there came a memory of David standing upon a giant using his own weapon and cutting his head off you see David didn't have a sword that day but he took the enemy's sword from him you know you've been equipped to take the enemy's sword from him come on because the enemy's been trying to use the word on you all your life you're not worthy you can't make it you can't get the Holy Ghost look at who you are look away your life path has come through look at the misery in your family why would God pay any attention to you I'll tell you why because he loved you and he can never take it back don't matter where that life went God will never leave you and you know even when David had that memory was it a good was it the next day better no it got worse and worse for David in fact at the end of that chapter he's acting like a madman spitting and spinels running down his beard because he's afraid for his life in the palace of the king of Philistia you know what you know all of that he's still the king can you say glory he's still the king amen because God says this is my firstborn you went to you David was the last of his family but God called him my firstborn you know what God said about firstborn children let me just give you a little clue enclosing everybody say closing what did you just shut the door on you shut the door on the devil we close the door on the devil we close the door on his thoughts don't think it's thoughts don't think his ways don't look back to what you were a man young man I challenge you go back home give your mom and dad a hug tell them you're sorry for where you've been in life let it let this challenge you now I'm going to go back I'm a different person that's what it means to be a new creation in Christ Jesus I'm a different person I don't go back to the same habits I don't go back to the same thing don't mean my life it's going to be a bed of roses but it's gonna be victorious through Jesus Christ let me encourage you he hath made you kings and priests I can't save you and therefore I can't tell you you're not eligible to be saved I can't tell you you're not worthy I have no right to but I can't tell you you are worthy of his blood worthy of his sacrifice and you know what all those hard turns for David did for him it
