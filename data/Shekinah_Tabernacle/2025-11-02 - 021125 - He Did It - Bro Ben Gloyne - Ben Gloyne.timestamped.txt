[0:01] [Music]
[4:49] Good morning. Good to see you all. God
[4:51] bless you all. Welcome to um the house
[4:53] of the Lord this morning. Feeling good?
[5:00] feeling refreshed.
[5:03] It's good. It's always um it's always a
[5:05] nice service after camp, you know,
[5:07] because people are I guess in our human
[5:10] nature.
[5:11] We do get caught up in things and the
[5:13] month the things of life, but we we go
[5:15] to these camps where we can
[5:17] [Music]
[5:19] we can really start to be our true
[5:21] selves, you know, cuz really ultimately
[5:23] what we all want to do is just not do
[5:24] anything and just just be with the Lord
[5:27] and just be in that atmosphere all the
[5:28] time. That's ultimately if we could
[5:29] click our fingers, that's life, you
[5:31] know.
[5:33] Um but you know we have to go about and
[5:34] do these mundane things of life but but
[5:36] always after a camp we've sort of been
[5:38] in the atmosphere for a while so we
[5:39] still kind of you know our spirits are
[5:42] are still up. Not like we're not up all
[5:45] the time but you know do you know what I
[5:47] mean?
[5:49] Sometimes you get a little bit down
[5:52] but it's just it's part of being a
[5:54] human. But um no one's down today.
[5:57] Everyone's up. You're all up. That's
[6:00] right. Um,
[6:03] I just want to make a just say a little
[6:05] something before I start. It's not it's
[6:07] just about the musicians because we've
[6:09] had a few people a few musicians have um
[6:11] left like the inquirers and I think we
[6:14] lost another some other people. So, we
[6:17] sort of need to keep the musicians
[6:19] coming on. So, what we were thinking
[6:22] about doing is if you're um if you if
[6:24] anyone here wants to play an instrument,
[6:27] I think some some people have talked to
[6:29] us before. We're just going to have a
[6:30] catch up after church like just to get
[6:32] you guys and girls into certain spots.
[6:35] Like I'm thinking of people like Rachel.
[6:37] We decided she's going to come up. She
[6:38] plays a very good guitar player and
[6:41] we're we're down a few guitar players
[6:43] now, electric guitar. And um brother um
[6:46] Onishi is not here, but he wants to he's
[6:48] going to play the drums and the
[6:49] different I think we had some girls on
[6:51] the drums and different ones. We're not
[6:53] going to have a band practice. We just
[6:55] want to um figure out how we're going to
[6:57] put everyone in, get get people up, get
[6:59] it started. I think when there's
[7:00] pressure to do something, you learn.
[7:02] Like if you just say, "Okay, you're up
[7:03] in 2 weeks." Then people go home and
[7:05] they practice. And we were joking this
[7:07] morning cuz brother brother Colin's
[7:08] going to start sitting up here and
[7:10] playing his guitar during Wednesday's
[7:12] service. And then we said, "Eventually
[7:13] you'll be there playing it. And then
[7:15] eventually you'll be here playing it
[7:17] because um and and then then we joke
[7:19] that we're, you know, we're passing the
[7:20] baton on to the next younger generation.
[7:27] Um, so yeah. Yeah.
[7:31] Yeah. If you could don't make me come
[7:33] and get you, okay? Like you know who you
[7:35] are and if you've said a whisper of
[7:38] anything, you know that I know, okay? So
[7:40] I'll come and get you after church if
[7:41] you're not there. Okay? So just turn up
[7:43] there once it's all finished. Just hang
[7:45] hang around there. Okay? Let's stand. Um
[7:47] this morning
[7:49] why don't we shake each other's hands
[7:51] and just say hello, greet each other.
[7:52] It's We're back in our home church. It's
[7:54] nice. This is the home fellowship. This
[7:56] is where we This is where we labor. This
[7:58] is our vineyard. We labor through the

[8:03] rain, through the storms, through the

[37:45] you you just come. Okay. Come.
[37:51] [Applause]
[37:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Um, I went into camp
[38:00] with three things on my heart that I
[38:03] really wanted from the Lord to know that
[38:04] he's heard. And on Sunday evening, Ben
[38:08] called me to come to the front to get
[38:10] brother Jonathan to pray for us. And as
[38:13] he was praying, just these things, the
[38:16] Lord gave me all the three things.
[38:17] Everything that he was praying for was
[38:20] everything that was in my heart. And
[38:21] only God knows.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; And I just really thank the Lord. And I
[38:25] was just so blessed with camp just to
[38:27] think it was such a Holy Ghost time,
[38:28] such a refreshing in the Holy Ghost.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Um yeah, I'm just so thankful we have
[38:33] the true living God. It was like I'm
[38:34] living in the book of Acts. I'm living
[38:36] at the time the Lord is moving. He's
[38:38] here. It was just so
[38:39] &gt;&gt; it was just so lovely. It was just um
[38:42] how do I describe it? It was that
[38:43] feeling where there's no
[38:45] &gt;&gt; nothing
[38:46] &gt;&gt; not nice. It was just the Lord and I
[38:48] just so thankful to have been there and
[38:50] to I really thank all of you just for
[38:53] your prayers and your love
[38:55] &gt;&gt; and I was told by medical people that I
[38:58] wouldn't be able to get to camp
[39:00] &gt;&gt; and I was there and the Lord touched me
[39:01] and I'm just so thankful.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you. Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Anyone else?
[39:11] It was truly a Holy Ghost meeting. Come.
[39:14] Just like you know when he held out the
[39:16] $20 note remember that spontaneousness
[39:19] you know just just come for
[39:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Um there are
[39:24] testimony is very short just like me but
[39:26] like
[39:28] I can't remember the meetings cuz um for
[39:30] the musicians probably the all the camp
[39:32] is just one long meeting because we are
[39:35] practicing we are just playing it's just
[39:37] awesome and I remember I was playing and
[39:42] you know yourself you know your failures
[39:45] you know everything about you and in one
[39:48] moment I felt this like the God talked
[39:50] to my heart and says
[39:53] son, I love you.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; And man,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; that's it. But man, that was awesome.
[40:00] And yeah, that was a very powerful camp.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; God bless his hands.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. I mean,
[40:08] what more do you want to hear, you know,
[40:10] from the Lord? Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Hello. Um, I was very blessed at camp
[40:15] every year. I think like how can you be
[40:18] blessed in the back row you know with
[40:20] the kids and everything and every year
[40:22] he blesses me and every year I haven't
[40:24] said anything but this year I have to
[40:26] because I was sitting with Christine and
[40:28] we were just singing with one of the
[40:29] last songs not many people were there
[40:31] and we just claimed our family we
[40:33] claimed healing and it was just such a
[40:36] powerful experience.
[40:38] Sorry.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; It's so amazing to know that he cares
[40:46] and he he answers our prayers and we
[40:49] were able to claim so much and we had
[40:51] all this power and with our whole hearts
[40:53] we were able to accept it and receive
[40:55] it. And I don't know how to explain but
[40:58] it was just such a powerful moment. and
[41:00] Christine was there and she she knows
[41:02] and for me my whole life I've wanted
[41:04] that and I finally got to experience
[41:07] that. It was also really special to be
[41:09] with Christine as well. So that was all.
[41:12] Thank you.
[41:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[41:18] He's still Jehovah of miracles.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; I said to the Lord, if if if she comes
[41:27] up, I'll come up. Um, and this was
[41:29] before the service. This was during the
[41:31] week because I really wanted to share
[41:33] this, but I I couldn't if if they
[41:35] didn't. And that was the moment that
[41:37] face that you're seeing there when I
[41:39] turned I had Ezekiel and I and I turned
[41:42] and and they were it was so powerful.
[41:45] They were they were leaving earth. They
[41:48] were they were in another dimension. I
[41:50] was like, Lord, thank you that I could
[41:52] re experience this that there was just
[41:56] this purity in this this this Yeah. just
[42:00] they're in the heavenly places and I
[42:02] couldn't even reach there, you know,
[42:04] they were just gone and they were
[42:06] singing that simple song of the devil is
[42:08] under my feet and but the reality and
[42:11] the revelation struck and I go that's
[42:13] that's all I needed. So from the camp
[42:16] there was a lot of things that happens.
[42:17] Us as deacons we see a lot of things and
[42:20] um I usually go with the expectation
[42:25] a theme if you like. Last year was God
[42:28] should be real. I don't want people
[42:30] dancing and and you know this is myself
[42:34] uh go to the front and do an altar call
[42:36] but it's not real and last year was
[42:38] real. This year was absolutely real but
[42:40] this year was profound. There was a lot
[42:42] of things that happened and and it come
[42:44] from decades ago and at our camp the
[42:48] devil got smashed. It was profound. It
[42:51] it came so together and just I thank the
[42:54] Lord that I could be part of that. Um
[42:57] and everyone that worked together. We
[42:59] didn't have Armont. We didn't have the
[43:00] Ruanas. We didn't have brother Paul. We
[43:03] didn't have me. I fell sick and it was
[43:05] absolutely attack of the devil. We
[43:07] talked about it yesterday. uh my back
[43:10] and and everything just went off. there
[43:13] was a off switch the energy everything
[43:16] and I go this is not and at camp it was
[43:18] still attacked and right after camp
[43:20] everything is fine like 100% from a zero
[43:23] to 100 I go that must be Satan but
[43:26] because I think the Lord showed me that
[43:28] that little gap that I thought I had was
[43:30] quickly filled by all you and you all
[43:33] just jumped in and all got it done and I
[43:35] thank the Lord the people that's not
[43:37] here I think Ben Bailey and all these I
[43:39] hope they see that you know Marion and
[43:40] everyone the the boys that rally
[43:42] together, Josh, Jono, AB, everyone. It
[43:45] was just, it's amazing to see. So, the
[43:47] dynamics of our church. Please treasure
[43:50] it. Um, we we really have something
[43:52] special here as a family. Thank you. God
[43:54] bless you.
[43:56] Thank God.
[43:58] Amen.
[44:00] Yeah, it wasn't amazing just I mean, if
[44:01] someone else wants to come up, I'm just
[44:03] going to talk to someone.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, hello. Sorry. I got to like look,
[44:07] you know, you go, bro. Thank you. God
[44:09] bless you.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Hey. Um on um Saturday we had a a friend
[44:14] come um to one of the services and on
[44:17] this Sunday night I got a um a huge
[44:19] burden on my heart to to go at the front
[44:21] to pray for them. Um and it it took a
[44:25] while the the the masses there. There
[44:27] was there was a few people. So I was
[44:28] I'll just wait a little bit. So I waited
[44:29] a little bit and then the feeling goes
[44:31] and you're like oh you know I'm I'm
[44:33] there with all my wires on me and it
[44:35] gets awkward. So I was like oh I was
[44:38] like no I had the feeling I'll go. So, I
[44:40] unpull everything off and and go down
[44:43] and and I go down there and there's
[44:44] still a few people there and I sort of
[44:46] um sort of get down to the to the bottom
[44:48] of the stairs and I and I look across
[44:50] and I see a on the far corner. I'm like
[44:52] sweet. I make a beline for him. He sees
[44:54] me as well. Um and and I pray for them
[44:57] and it's just how the Lord makes
[44:59] everything work in a way that he lets
[45:01] you know that he is in that moment. It
[45:04] was just like like I just I sort of drop
[45:05] the bass, go up there, Mo seamlessly
[45:07] comes up and just starts playing. Um I
[45:10] talk to Alan and I say how I'm praying
[45:12] for my friends. You know it's a real
[45:13] sort of burden that came on me. He
[45:15] starts praying and he instantly just
[45:17] just in just pops a couple of things in
[45:19] there that I know that they I want to
[45:23] say they are dealing with but that's the
[45:24] problem that they have with hearing us
[45:26] and it's just like wow thank you Lord
[45:28] just straight in straight in straight on
[45:30] on on quue on time you know and it's and
[45:32] it could be anyone anyone up there any
[45:34] any of those pastors up there if I ended
[45:36] up with them you know it it just it just
[45:38] I just said thank you Lord and it was
[45:40] amazing so yeah
[45:42] &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord Amen. Yeah.
[45:48] Sorry. There's um
[45:50] &gt;&gt; he was out of the blocks first.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Should be ladies.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[45:57] I just want to give God all the praise
[45:59] and glory and honor. Um
[46:02] coming up to camp was a real trial for
[46:04] all of us. Um yes, as my brother said,
[46:08] you know, there was changes. Um, our
[46:11] sister was out, the family's moving on,
[46:15] but I'm so grateful to be amongst my
[46:18] brothers and sisters here. I saw the
[46:20] Lord really work for this weekend or for
[46:23] the camp weekend.
[46:26] Our Lord does things in in ways that we
[46:29] don't or can't understand or explain. He
[46:32] takes key people out of the loop, but
[46:36] yet he restores
[46:39] and he raises up new gifts. Gifts that
[46:41] we didn't know that was there
[46:44] was shining over that weekend from every
[46:48] one of you from the cleaner right to the
[46:51] kitchen hand to the guy that took the
[46:53] bins out. Everyone. So I just want you
[46:57] all to remember that because it's a body
[47:00] work. You know the musicians are busy,
[47:04] the pastor is busy, but each one of you
[47:07] all that's sitting in front of me here
[47:09] actually had a job to do and you
[47:11] fulfilled your roles. So thank you very
[47:14] much. Um that takes away a lot of
[47:18] pressure from person standing next to
[47:21] you or the sister or brother that
[47:22] normally does it. Um, it showed that
[47:25] each one of you all got a special gift
[47:27] in you all. Just continue
[47:30] holding that torch up high and and and
[47:32] and let that light shine. So, we
[47:35] appreciate each one of you uh for what
[47:37] you all done and what youall are doing
[47:39] amongst our our our brethren here. What
[47:41] you are doing is very important. So, God
[47:44] bless you all. Thank you.
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:55] Um, I just want to say that I feel like
[47:57] God has been with us just even in the
[48:00] storm before camp, you know, just kind
[48:02] of dictating when my brother arrived,
[48:05] the way he got there through the storm
[48:07] and the detours and and everything, but
[48:09] he just arrived at a much better time
[48:11] than he would have had the storm not
[48:13] been there. But because my husband went
[48:16] down on Sunday, flew down to see my my
[48:19] mother-in-law who's dying.
[48:22] Excuse me. He he got there at a really
[48:25] good time going Sunday and I really
[48:28] wanted to go and I thought I can go back
[48:30] with David and then this storm was
[48:32] blowing a gale on Monday night and I was
[48:34] I went home and I went to sleep in the
[48:36] chair. I was like I don't want to go in
[48:37] the storm. I don't want to go on the
[48:40] boat in this storm. And I rang David and
[48:43] he was with the pilot, a pilot master
[48:44] from the harbor and he said, "No, tide's
[48:46] going to turn at 1:00. I mean, we're
[48:48] sailing at 2:00." He said, "The meters,
[48:50] it's only going to be one and a half
[48:52] meters." And I was like,
[48:54] "Wow." You know, I went on that boat and
[48:56] had a smooth sailing. And I got there to
[48:58] see Joan the last day that she is
[49:01] actually talking. Tuesday was the last
[49:03] day that she was talking and eating. So,
[49:07] I mean, she still knows me and that, but
[49:09] I just
[49:11] not just me, for Rachel and all my
[49:14] family have been down. God's worked out
[49:16] a way for us to do it every time to see
[49:19] her and just
[49:22] so many things about camp. God really
[49:24] touched me, too. And I'm I'm grateful.
[49:27] Yeah.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:32] It was amazing with the weather, you
[49:34] know. is like we just had a pocket of
[49:36] beautiful weather before the devil did
[49:38] his thing. You know, even even the fact
[49:40] brother John sister Sharon couldn't fly
[49:42] into Wellington. Um they had to they had
[49:44] to rent a car down. They got to spend
[49:47] time in Talpo where they had their
[49:48] honeymoon 30 odd years ago. So it all
[49:50] just worked out fine. Amen. So we thank
[49:52] the Lord for that. Amen. Is any any more
[49:54] for anymore?
[50:05] God bless everyone. Um, this year is our
[50:08] first time to be at camp for the whole
[50:10] time. I was really grateful to leave
[50:13] family because they closed the business.
[50:17] They uh over the comp so that I could um
[50:21] my family could be there for the whole
[50:22] time. in this camp is been really
[50:26] blessing to especially to my husband
[50:28] John because I didn't see him going to
[50:31] the church
[50:34] um because all his life he's always um
[50:40] choosing work over church. I don't know
[50:42] if in this um camp um we talk about it
[50:47] and he feels that the God refresh and
[50:51] restored his faith. It was such a really
[50:55] really blessing and and
[51:00] um also with my family way back in the
[51:03] Philippines. um we send the link of the
[51:07] of the services and they also been
[51:09] blessing blessed to watch it. And last
[51:13] Sunday uh the Sunday service, Sunday
[51:16] evening service, I was um I was praying
[51:21] to God that um that the Lord um restored
[51:25] John and
[51:28] um he lift everything to the Lord. And I
[51:30] was I didn't expect that John would um
[51:34] will ask for prayer and he's with um
[51:39] brother Jonathan and he asked for prayer
[51:42] and I was really blessed that I see him
[51:48] going to the front because I really
[51:50] didn't expect him. He was really shy
[51:52] going to the front and he asked for
[51:54] prayer and it was such a really really
[51:57] blessing and that's all. Thank you.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Praise the Lord. That's
[52:03] wonderful. That's amazing. Thank you so
[52:06] much.
[52:07] Amen.
[52:09] Anyone? Oh yes. Praise the Lord.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. I came up here. I don't
[52:20] I didn't want know what to say, but um
[52:23] camp is it really changed me there. And
[52:26] I went up I think it was one of the last
[52:29] nights or something. I went up for
[52:31] prayer and
[52:33] I went up and told him what I needed and
[52:35] he just spoke the words to me like
[52:38] they they really meant something to me.
[52:40] And then afterward he he came and prayed
[52:42] with me and Gabby and it was just I
[52:44] don't know something touched me and
[52:46] changed me. It was it was really good.
[52:48] And cuz the devil was tormenting me with
[52:52] all sorts of stuff there and yeah, he
[52:55] just helped me there. And yeah, that's
[52:58] all I wanted to say. Thank you.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Thanks for praise God.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Ben.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Hello everybody.
[53:20] Um, I've got a little bit of a testimony
[53:22] this year. It's not a big one. It's just
[53:24] a regular old testimony. But, um, last
[53:28] year I was thinking about what I was
[53:31] going to go to camp for cuz I usually
[53:33] have a theme in mind when I go to camp.
[53:35] And last year, I'd already had my
[53:37] salvation. So, I didn't know what I was
[53:39] going to go for. So, last year I went
[53:40] and I was like, Lord, I really want TMA.
[53:52] Guys,
[53:55] I was like, "Lord, please don't make me
[53:56] cry. I don't want to be like mom."
[54:05] It's all right. I'll get there.
[54:07] Um,
[54:10] it's not major what happened, but before
[54:13] TMA went to camp, she was planning to go
[54:15] to Oakland next year to study at Oakland
[54:18] University. And I don't know if many of
[54:20] you know, but she works she works for me
[54:22] now, so she works for me full-time.
[54:25] And it was just supposed to be a a
[54:27] temporary summer job. And then
[54:30] and then she was going to go to Oakland.
[54:34] And I've been praying every night, Lord,
[54:38] please, please let Tina's salvation come
[54:40] quickly. Don't make it too long. Lord,
[54:42] just please save her soon. And it never
[54:46] really feels like I'm getting an answer.
[54:48] Um sometimes things happen, but usually
[54:50] it's just a regular old prayer. But um
[54:55] after camp, she came to me and she said,
[54:57] "Oh, I've got some news for you,
[54:58] Hannah." I said, "Oh, what?" She said,
[55:02] "I don't think I've got to go to
[55:03] Oakuckland anymore." And I said, "Oh,
[55:05] really?" She said, "No, I don't think
[55:07] so. I'm just going to stay here and work
[55:09] full-time for you and take a part-time
[55:10] course." And I was like, "Oh, really?
[55:12] Why?" She said, "Because everyone's
[55:14] here." I like, and she'd just been to
[55:17] camp and just made friends and she'd
[55:19] been running around having fun with
[55:20] everybody. And she said, "Everyone that
[55:22] I know is here." So, thank you guys for
[55:25] the camp.
[55:27] I really appreciate it. All right,
[55:29] that's it.
[55:31] Thanks, Ann. I appreciate that. Amen.
[55:36] God is working.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Um hello every
[55:47] um I just said to the Lord, if if I'm
[55:49] supposed to do this, please let cuz I
[55:51] needed the bathroom. So if it's still
[55:53] going on, then I will come up. So um
[55:56] just this just a quick testimony of what
[56:00] happened going into camp. So um a couple
[56:03] of about a month before camp or couple
[56:06] of weeks before camp um Christine and I
[56:08] were talking and she said um we really
[56:11] need to get a chef for camp. And so
[56:16] leading up to camp um a couple of weeks
[56:19] before um I I'd done everything that I
[56:23] had can to to try and get a chef and
[56:26] everyone that I had contacted
[56:29] they were busy that weekend and
[56:31] eventually um I got the one chef that he
[56:35] said potentially but then he came back
[56:38] and he said no he can't do it and I
[56:41] asked him do you know of anyone someone
[56:44] that can do you recommend someone and he
[56:47] said, "Oh, he potentially knows
[56:49] somebody, but he'll send me the details
[56:51] and make contact and and but he's way
[56:55] too busy." So
[56:58] just before I made contact, I called
[57:00] Christine and we we were chatting and um
[57:04] and I said to Christine, I'm not worried
[57:07] about getting a chef for camp because
[57:10] whoever the chef is, I know that the
[57:12] Lord is preparing this person and it
[57:15] doesn't matter what happens, we will
[57:16] find a chef and the Lord will prepare
[57:18] this chef just for us. And along came
[57:23] Rahul. We we'd met him and he is such a
[57:27] soft gentle person and he was he he yes
[57:31] we met with Ben and Christine and he
[57:33] said yes he can do it he penciled it all
[57:36] in
[57:38] and at camp you know
[57:43] he'd made contact with brother brother
[57:46] John Edis had made contact with him and
[57:48] things like that and there is something
[57:50] going on with the chef and the son and
[57:52] all of that so I just wanted want to
[57:54] just give the Lord the glory for
[57:57] bringing that particular chef with his
[57:59] son. Um the Lord knows what he's doing
[58:02] and sometimes we scramble and we you
[58:05] know we get stressed and we worry about
[58:07] these things but you know if we just
[58:09] walk and just let the Lord do what he's
[58:11] doing he's got it all prepared. So, I
[58:14] just want to give the Lord the glory for
[58:16] bringing that particular chef and his
[58:18] and his son because he suggested
[58:22] bringing his son along to camp to help
[58:24] us as as a um kitchen hand. So, I just
[58:27] want to give the Lord the glory for that
[58:28] for whatever he's done so far and
[58:31] whatever he's still going to do for the
[58:33] sh um this chef and also to bless him
[58:36] because of the meals that he's prepared
[58:39] for all of us and that was an extreme
[58:41] blessing for everyone. So, I just want
[58:43] to give the Lord the glory for that.
[58:45] Thank you.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Part two.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I'm all tangled up again. Um, so I've
[58:57] got a um a a testimony coming about my
[59:01] job and and changing things. But in and
[59:03] around that, I had um said to my new
[59:07] boss that I'll go away with him on a
[59:09] tournament this weekend um for football.
[59:12] I I get to play a bit of football. Um,
[59:14] but that would have been me leaving on
[59:16] the Friday. So, what I what I did was I
[59:19] finished up work at my old company on
[59:21] the Thursday. So, I had the Friday off.
[59:24] And this is not really quite around
[59:25] camp, but it it sort of ties in a little
[59:27] bit. So um but in and around that
[59:31] happening um um Nana Joanie went started
[59:36] going downhill and obviously we had the
[59:38] camp with um Nana Joan being on on her
[59:40] last legs and she's still been um alive
[59:43] and we changed our plans and sort of and
[59:47] said hey I I won't go to the tournament.
[59:49] I I'll I'll miss that. And then that
[59:51] gives Rachel the opportunity to go um
[59:53] down south. So me having the Friday off
[59:56] made all that work and it was just the
[59:59] way God worked in and around cuz cuz I
[1:00:01] got to the last training Tuesday night
[1:00:04] and we had the training. I enjoyed it.
[1:00:05] It was fun. We finished and we finished
[1:00:08] up and the guys were talking about what
[1:00:10] they were going to do sort of getting to
[1:00:12] this tournament because it was in Napia
[1:00:14] and Stain and I just got this feeling of
[1:00:17] yes I enjoy the games. Yes, I enjoy
[1:00:18] playing but I I still want to hang out
[1:00:21] with these guys. I I don't I didn't
[1:00:23] really have the feeling of going away
[1:00:25] and enjoying that. And I was like, "No."
[1:00:26] And in my mind, I'd already realized
[1:00:28] that I'd missed this church service. And
[1:00:30] I And I really dislike missing any
[1:00:33] church at all, but especially like just
[1:00:35] after camp. So, it was all that that God
[1:00:38] just had he had a plan. He just ran
[1:00:40] everything through. So, I've made the
[1:00:42] service. I've Rachel made it down to
[1:00:44] Christ Church and everything just works
[1:00:46] seamlessly. And I just want to say thank
[1:00:47] you, Lord.
[1:00:52] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hi guys.
[1:01:05] So I've got two testimonies. Um one is
[1:01:09] about the games. So um um I had I love
[1:01:13] Jenny too. Can I just tell you I love
[1:01:15] you? I love Jenny because she's such a
[1:01:18] good sport. anything I suggest to her,
[1:01:19] she's like, "Yeah, let's do it." And um
[1:01:22] so the games this year was actually
[1:01:24] going to be hobby horse riding. Um I
[1:01:27] don't know if you've seen the Olympic
[1:01:28] hobby horse riding and they go on this
[1:01:31] stick with the horse head and it's
[1:01:33] stuffed
[1:01:35] and it just looks absolutely incredibly
[1:01:38] stupid. And I thought, man, wouldn't
[1:01:40] that be so much fun getting these guys
[1:01:42] riding a hobby horse?
[1:01:44] And then I mentioned it to Jay at um at
[1:01:47] the factory and he's like, "Oh no, mom.
[1:01:49] Please, man. Just don't embarrass us all
[1:01:52] the time." And I thought to myself, I
[1:01:54] was like, "Oh man, I know I'll get a
[1:01:56] kick out of it, but I don't know if
[1:01:57] anybody else will. I know I'll be
[1:01:59] laughing." But so then it was probably
[1:02:02] two days before,
[1:02:04] was it about a week or maybe the the few
[1:02:08] days I And so I'm like, "Oh man, I've
[1:02:10] got nothing. I've got no games."
[1:02:13] And then um and then I was praying about
[1:02:16] it getting pretty desperate because I
[1:02:17] was like man I really wanted a hobby
[1:02:19] horse riding but nobody else does. So,
[1:02:21] um, so I actually went to prayer and,
[1:02:24] um, funny enough, cuz I don't really
[1:02:25] pray about the games cuz it's not real
[1:02:27] spiritual, you know, it's not like a,
[1:02:30] um, and I just went to prayer and then I
[1:02:31] was like, Lord, I've got nothing. And
[1:02:33] then it just bing like the light bulb,
[1:02:35] you know, as when the Lord does it and
[1:02:38] um, it was just a big capture the flag
[1:02:41] game and um, yeah, it just went really
[1:02:43] well. So, I was so thankful. And then
[1:02:45] Jenny's of course on board. Yep, let's
[1:02:46] do it. And we she did the quiz and then
[1:02:49] the um and then the hiding we did. So
[1:02:52] the capture the flag game was like this
[1:02:53] big massive um stick in the mud tag game
[1:02:57] along with capture the flag and then
[1:02:59] finding lollies and it was pretty epic.
[1:03:01] Next year I'm going to do drone and
[1:03:02] water balloons with it. But um so that
[1:03:06] was a real blessing that the Lord
[1:03:07] undertook and I realized why it was so
[1:03:08] important to do games cuz you think oh
[1:03:10] it's not really you know big grand
[1:03:13] spiritual thing but it's important
[1:03:15] because you you get around people that
[1:03:17] some people don't know each other but
[1:03:19] you get an experience with them that has
[1:03:22] you know you can relate to them at least
[1:03:24] with this cool experience. And then I
[1:03:26] think Dave got tied up um Ruben got tied
[1:03:29] up. Everybody cheated. Um so I I don't
[1:03:33] know if the Christian qualities come out
[1:03:35] but um uh fund us. So it was it was it
[1:03:38] was such a blessing. And then the second
[1:03:40] testimony was um okay going into a
[1:03:44] little thing. So Sharon are the
[1:03:46] Marriott's here. No. Uh three camps ago
[1:03:49] I think it was we were sitting it was K.
[1:03:51] Adam Reeds Louise Maloney Sharon and I
[1:03:54] at lunch. I think it was three camps or
[1:03:57] I can't remember exactly. And we were
[1:04:00] sitting around the table at lunch. We
[1:04:01] were the only ones there left. And
[1:04:03] Sharon had a real breakthrough in prayer
[1:04:06] for Bruce at that time. And we could
[1:04:08] feel it. And it was like, whoa, that was
[1:04:10] powerful. And then um so then I was
[1:04:12] talking to K again, K. Adam Reed. Um
[1:04:15] she's such a blessing. Eh, and so again
[1:04:18] at lunch and we were talking about um
[1:04:21] the the form of worship and dancing. And
[1:04:24] I told her how that I don't know if you
[1:04:26] remember the first time when we came to
[1:04:27] the church, Hen and I danced around the
[1:04:30] the church. And I really felt the Lord
[1:04:32] tell me, I'm pleased with your worship.
[1:04:35] So when you want to please the Lord and
[1:04:36] that's all you want to do, it means a
[1:04:38] lot to you. So I'm like, wow. Actually,
[1:04:41] dancing is a form of worship as well.
[1:04:43] And although Satan wants to pervert it
[1:04:45] and make it other things, God still
[1:04:48] loves dancing. And um and so do I. But
[1:04:52] um so so um we were talking about that
[1:04:55] and um Sister Kay said she had recent
[1:04:58] like gone quiet and and doing that and
[1:05:00] also singing and things and um and so we
[1:05:02] were just praying and and then we went
[1:05:04] to service and um and so the service I
[1:05:08] think brother Jonathan mentioned dancing
[1:05:10] three times and every time he turned
[1:05:13] every time he mentioned it we're like
[1:05:16] and so we're getting pretty excited in
[1:05:18] our seats right and then um and then
[1:05:20] afterwards dur and then um prayed for
[1:05:22] it. Yeah, it was quite an anointed time
[1:05:25] that one. And um and then um Isaac uh
[1:05:30] got tired, so he handed the mic over to
[1:05:32] Boaz. Whoa. Like it was just talk about
[1:05:37] dancing. Oh, and I just when it when he
[1:05:41] just started, I just couldn't help
[1:05:42] myself. And I think the whole church
[1:05:44] couldn't help themselves. And man, what
[1:05:47] a jubilee. So it was man and just from
[1:05:50] that and also I got to dance with my
[1:05:51] girls. I don't know if you know how
[1:05:53] special that is. That's real special um
[1:05:56] to me because yeah, Satan tried to take
[1:05:59] that form of worship away from us. So
[1:06:01] that was a real blessing.
[1:06:04] Um uh and then I turned to Sister Kay
[1:06:08] and I said, "Hey, do you know who's at
[1:06:10] camp?" And um she and I said, "Bruce is
[1:06:14] at camp." And we all it was just a grand
[1:06:16] jubilee. It was just a grand jubilee
[1:06:18] knowing that he's in your lunchtime.
[1:06:21] You know, he he when you're talking with
[1:06:23] someone else, he's there. The Lord's
[1:06:24] there. When he's when you're running
[1:06:26] around, racing around the church, he's
[1:06:29] there. When you, you know, you're
[1:06:31] playing games, whatever you're doing at
[1:06:32] the camp or even now when we go to
[1:06:36] lunch, he's always with us. He's always
[1:06:38] there. So, I was really blessed. That's
[1:06:39] my testimony.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Amen.
[1:06:47] Amen. We thank the Lord.
[1:06:49] Amen.

[1:12:32] done great things for us whereof we are

[1:14:04] some furniture for my parents and I just
[1:14:06] reminded myself why I'm not a truck
[1:14:07] driver, you know, driving all that way
[1:14:09] and back. So, just bear with me, you
[1:14:11] know, but we're here. Um but I just want
[1:14:13] to, you know, if I could take a thought
[1:14:15] from this, I just want to just just, you
[1:14:17] know, if I could title this, I want I
[1:14:18] want to title it, he did it. There's
[1:14:21] something about when you look at the
[1:14:22] greatness of God and you and you you
[1:14:24] know, you know, before the fact, there's
[1:14:26] this longing. There's like you know he
[1:14:28] can do it, right? You've read his word.
[1:14:30] He's anchored it in your heart. you
[1:14:32] know, he's become real to you, but yet
[1:14:34] there's just such a glorious like
[1:14:36] reality when when when when you step
[1:14:39] into a vision, he fulfills his word. And
[1:14:41] then when you step out of it and you
[1:14:42] look back and say, "He did it." Like,
[1:14:44] it's incredible. It's such a, you know,
[1:14:46] it's a it's a phenomenal thing to see
[1:14:48] the living God answer our prayers. Amen.
[1:14:50] Meet our needs, fulfill his word in our
[1:14:52] lives. It's an incredible thing. And and
[1:14:55] and to me, you know, when I was thinking
[1:14:57] about this driving home and, you know,
[1:14:58] this scripture came to mind where it
[1:15:00] says that, you know, they were like
[1:15:02] when, you know, when the Lord turned
[1:15:03] again the captivity of Zion, we were
[1:15:05] like them that dream. It's like, is this
[1:15:07] really real? Is it really happening? You
[1:15:09] know, it's not beyond belief because
[1:15:11] he's made us to believe for all things.
[1:15:13] But it's such a surreal moment, you
[1:15:15] know, when it's like, is this really
[1:15:17] happening? Has he really done it? You
[1:15:18] know, we've had such a longing and such
[1:15:20] a burden, such a desire to see him live,
[1:15:22] you know, like I know. I'm sure it's
[1:15:24] from from camp to camp. We've got a
[1:15:25] desire, Lord, we're so excited for camp,
[1:15:28] you know, we're so excited when we go to
[1:15:29] special meetings or, you know, but it's
[1:15:31] like a it's like you step into a dream.
[1:15:33] It's like you're watching a scene unfold
[1:15:35] and you know, you know, I'm well, this
[1:15:37] is my experience anyway. You just watch
[1:15:38] this whole thing unfold and you're just
[1:15:40] kind of there, but you're you're not
[1:15:42] there and you're there and you're just
[1:15:43] like, "Wow, is this really going on?"
[1:15:44] And then you and then when it's all
[1:15:46] done, you really kind of like, "Wow,
[1:15:48] that was awesome."
[1:15:51] Amen. This is the Bible in basic English
[1:15:52] which I need to read from time to time.
[1:15:54] It says a song of the going up. It's an
[1:15:57] ascension. This is a song of degrees
[1:15:58] means a song of ascension. So as we're
[1:16:01] rising, Amen. I believe these psalms are
[1:16:02] very applicable to us. I mean cuz we are
[1:16:05] we are going up. Amen. We're not going
[1:16:07] down. We're not going across. We're
[1:16:08] going up. Amen. Amen. So when the Lord
[1:16:11] made a change in Zion's fate, we were
[1:16:13] like men in a dream. Amen. When the Lord
[1:16:16] changes the fate of someone, it's a
[1:16:18] credible thing when you you see because
[1:16:20] we got to realize and I'm sure we all
[1:16:22] know this, but we were our fate. The
[1:16:24] devil had us bound in a fate and that
[1:16:26] was a destruction. That was a burning in
[1:16:29] a lake of fire. That was, you know,
[1:16:30] that's that was our fate. But God
[1:16:32] interrupted his plans. Amen. And he
[1:16:34] changed our fate from destruction to
[1:16:36] glory. I mean, he changed our, you know,
[1:16:38] our fate of just living in sin, being
[1:16:40] driven around by that slave master of
[1:16:43] the devil. Amen. And he and he changed
[1:16:45] our faith that now we're living in the
[1:16:47] fullness of God. Amen. God dwells in us.
[1:16:49] He's changed our lives. We're going from
[1:16:51] glory to glory. Amen. You know, it's
[1:16:53] just an incredible thing. We realize
[1:16:55] we're walking in the goodness of God.
[1:16:57] Amen. Where his mercy, you know, I just
[1:16:59] loved how brother Jonathan used that
[1:17:01] phrase. We're living in a season of
[1:17:03] grace. Amen. And this grace season is
[1:17:06] not going to come to an end. It cannot
[1:17:08] come to an end because a word has come
[1:17:10] in this season where he says there's
[1:17:12] going to be a people, amen, they're
[1:17:14] going to know their God. They're going
[1:17:15] to God's going to live in them. All the
[1:17:17] promises of the bride are going to be
[1:17:18] fulfilled like the prophet said that
[1:17:20] Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies of
[1:17:22] the Old Testament and the bride is going
[1:17:24] to fulfill all the prophecies of the New
[1:17:26] Testament. Amen. So, we're living in a
[1:17:28] season of divine inspiration, of
[1:17:30] enablement, of grace. Amen. And this
[1:17:33] grace will not come to an end, friends.
[1:17:35] We are living in a great season. Amen.
[1:17:37] This season will not come to an end.
[1:17:39] Amen. Because it will take us into a
[1:17:41] rapture. That's the great culmination of
[1:17:43] this season of grace. And then we're
[1:17:45] going to go to the banqueting, wedding,
[1:17:46] supper, table. Amen. Where our seats
[1:17:48] been reserved. That's a season of gra.
[1:17:50] That's a placing by grace. Amen. And
[1:17:53] then we're going to come back to earth.
[1:17:54] There's a millennium and all those, you
[1:17:56] know, then eternity is going to roll on.
[1:17:57] Yeah. Yeah. I know I missed a few
[1:17:59] details, but but we all know the plan,
[1:18:01] right? But it's a great season of grace
[1:18:03] is going to unfold through eternity. I
[1:18:05] believe that's just I just want to tell
[1:18:07] you this season is not going to come to
[1:18:09] an end. Okay? Don't never let the devil
[1:18:11] get in your mind that you can step out
[1:18:14] of this season. I believe once you're
[1:18:15] in, you're in. You're stuck. Amen. By
[1:18:18] the grace of God. Amen. You're in this
[1:18:20] season of grace. And it's not low. It's
[1:18:22] not it's not confined to a location. No,
[1:18:25] no, no. You can go anywhere you want.
[1:18:26] You can go to Mars if you wanted to, but
[1:18:28] you'd still be in that season if you're
[1:18:29] part of his bride. I believe I'm looking
[1:18:31] at Amen. people who are who are
[1:18:33] fulfilling that or God is. Now, so it's
[1:18:36] an incredible thing. The Lord has
[1:18:37] changed our fate. Now, a dream. This is
[1:18:40] just Webster. I just I've just got a few
[1:18:42] things here. So, uh so it's a series of
[1:18:44] thoughts, pictures or feelings occurring
[1:18:46] during sleep. So, it's things you've
[1:18:48] been thinking on. You know, sometimes
[1:18:49] you have a dream. It's a bunch of crazy
[1:18:51] stuff mixed up, but then you can kind of
[1:18:53] realize it's something you've talked
[1:18:54] about, something you've seen. It's like
[1:18:56] a culmination of things. Who's had that
[1:18:58] kind of a dream? Yep. Who's had who's
[1:19:01] had actually a spiritual dream? You've
[1:19:02] seen it come to pass,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; right? Very different kind of a dream.
[1:19:05] It it's also a vision created in the
[1:19:07] imagination like a daydream. It's
[1:19:09] something that is notable for its beauty
[1:19:11] or pleasing quality. It's a goal that is
[1:19:13] longed for. It's an ideal. Amen. And
[1:19:15] truly the word of God to see it
[1:19:16] fulfilled is something that we long for.
[1:19:18] Amen. That we desire where where he's
[1:19:21] done so much
[1:19:24] yet we want him to do more cuz he's we
[1:19:27] don't want him to stop. Just like Moses
[1:19:30] would say to him, Lord, don't if you go,
[1:19:33] may we go with you. You know, don't
[1:19:35] don't ever leave us behind. We want to
[1:19:36] walk right with you. Moses would say,
[1:19:38] just paraphrasing um you know, what he
[1:19:40] said. So, you know, it's you know,
[1:19:42] something that you know, we've seen him
[1:19:43] do so much, but we want to see him do
[1:19:45] more. Amen. It's it's it's to think as
[1:19:48] of happening or possible. It's something
[1:19:50] to imagine. Now, I'm so glad we're not
[1:19:52] just living in a daydream as in
[1:19:55] something that will never become
[1:19:56] reality.
[1:19:58] This message is not a daydream in that
[1:20:00] way. Amen. It is something to be longed
[1:20:02] for. And the reason you long for it is
[1:20:05] because God put a desire in your heart
[1:20:06] because he wants to fulfill it in your
[1:20:08] life. Amen. You're very if you know if
[1:20:11] if if any thought of the word comes in
[1:20:13] your mind that you should do it, you're
[1:20:15] a blessed person. You're a very blessed
[1:20:17] person. That's actually a supernatural
[1:20:18] moment coming into your life. Amen. So,
[1:20:21] so you know, but these things, they
[1:20:22] don't just stay as a dream, but they
[1:20:24] become reality. Can you imagine the
[1:20:26] children of um children of Israel when
[1:20:28] they're down in Egypt, you know, they
[1:20:30] had the they had Joseph's bones there.
[1:20:32] They had the prophecy that they were
[1:20:34] going to leave. God was going to bring a
[1:20:35] deliverer. And it would have become a
[1:20:37] dream, such a desire, Lord, because it
[1:20:39] said, you know, the Bible says that they
[1:20:41] begin to call on the Lord when they got
[1:20:42] into slavery. And you know, you know,
[1:20:44] there was such a longing, Lord, when are
[1:20:46] you going to fulfill this? We know it's
[1:20:47] in your word. We are so hungry to see it
[1:20:49] fulfilled. But then it would have become
[1:20:52] and and and this was everyday life for
[1:20:54] them. This was this was the Monday to
[1:20:56] Sunday whatever their work I don't know
[1:20:57] what they did but you know what I mean
[1:20:59] this was their everyday portion of of of
[1:21:01] having this desire having this dream but
[1:21:04] then one day it happened I mean so a
[1:21:07] longing became a reality amen and I
[1:21:10] believe every longing that's based in
[1:21:12] the word God will fulfill it in his way
[1:21:14] I mean I've never seen a believer that
[1:21:16] that that just hope for something and it
[1:21:18] never comes to pass I mean God fulfills
[1:21:21] it how he wants to fulfill it so finally
[1:21:23] ly they would come into a very unusual
[1:21:26] season where here comes a man who's 80
[1:21:28] years old and his older brothers there
[1:21:30] Aaron you know Moses and Aaron would
[1:21:32] come and you know Moses had not been
[1:21:34] seen by you know you for about 40 years
[1:21:36] he comes into Israel and he says that
[1:21:39] the God of our fathers has visited me I
[1:21:41] saw him as a burning bush and he spoke
[1:21:43] to me out of that bush and and he gave
[1:21:45] me two signs but by these you know I'm
[1:21:48] going to deliver Israel and then he did
[1:21:50] the two signs it would have been like a
[1:21:52] dream is this really happening? Is this
[1:21:55] is this really is this man really the
[1:21:57] fulfillment of prophecy? And he was the
[1:22:00] fulfillment of prophecy. And then the
[1:22:02] plagues begin to fall. Then the darkness
[1:22:04] came and the blood was applied. And then
[1:22:07] there was the cry through Egypt as it
[1:22:08] you know of the death angel and they
[1:22:10] were dressed and ready to go. And then
[1:22:12] finally the you know the order was was
[1:22:14] was given. We're leaving. Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; After that dream of when will will we be
[1:22:20] free? Well, we'll be able to live in
[1:22:22] this promised land that has been
[1:22:23] promised to our fathers. Will it come
[1:22:25] into manifestation? And then they find
[1:22:27] themselves leaving. It would have been
[1:22:29] like a dream.
[1:22:31] Pinch me, Caleb. You know, is this
[1:22:34] really happening, Joshua? Oh, it's
[1:22:35] happening. It's happening. Amen. God is
[1:22:38] fulfilling his word. I tell you what,
[1:22:40] friends, this message has been here for
[1:22:42] 60 odd years. God is fulfilling it like
[1:22:44] never before. Amen. Where he's filling
[1:22:47] people with the Holy Ghost. He's
[1:22:48] bringing prodals home. He's bringing
[1:22:50] stability to families. He's showing us
[1:22:52] who we really are. And he's showing us
[1:22:54] our position in Christ. He is really
[1:22:56] fulfilling his word. Amen. We see the
[1:22:58] beast rise up and everything the world's
[1:23:00] doing. Amen. What was prophesied is now
[1:23:03] manifested. Amen. If that's on the
[1:23:05] negative side, how much more on the
[1:23:06] positive side? Amen. Where there was a
[1:23:08] there was a prophecy of a bride without
[1:23:10] spot or wrinkle. And here she is here
[1:23:12] this morning. Amen. You're part of that
[1:23:14] vision. I tell you what, friends. Amen.
[1:23:16] God has turned your fate. Amen. He's
[1:23:19] turned it from being a slave to sin.
[1:23:20] Amen. To being an heir of grace. Amen.
[1:23:22] To to an overcomer. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] That you can actually express what you
[1:23:28] were made to be before the foundation of
[1:23:30] the world. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, it
[1:23:33] was such a longing, but they left. And
[1:23:35] I'll tell you what, friends, we're in an
[1:23:37] exodus. Amen. We have goodbye. Goodbye,
[1:23:40] world. I'll stay no longer with you.
[1:23:42] Goodbye. Pleasures of sin. Amen. I found
[1:23:45] a far greater reward in Christ Jesus my
[1:23:47] Lord. Amen. I've left the world behind.
[1:23:49] Amen. I am in an exodus. I am leaving.
[1:23:52] Amen. And I'm ready to leave this world
[1:23:54] and go to the next world at any moment
[1:23:56] because the blood has been applied.
[1:23:58] Amen. God has turned my fate from death
[1:24:01] to life. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] Amen. Can you imagine? Israel was Israel
[1:24:08] was here for 40 days. They were living.
[1:24:11] They were living under this, you know,
[1:24:13] in this stalemate. You know, Goliath
[1:24:15] would come out and bring his boast.
[1:24:16] Bring me a man. Bring me a champion.
[1:24:18] Amen. Bring me one man to come and fight
[1:24:20] me and we'll we'll settle this thing
[1:24:22] just just just with one-on-one combat.
[1:24:24] And there, you know, can you imagine
[1:24:26] standing there? They were stuck in this.
[1:24:28] You know, decisions had to be made. But
[1:24:30] there was no one willing to stand forth
[1:24:32] and take up the giants challenge. But
[1:24:35] then finally a little shepherd boy
[1:24:36] walked in. So it would have been a dream
[1:24:38] of the Israelite soldiers you know they
[1:24:40] would have talked about know about
[1:24:41] Joshua and the mighty campaigns and what
[1:24:44] God did in the past and you know but so
[1:24:46] there would have been you know a longing
[1:24:48] surely someone can do it but no one was
[1:24:51] carrying a revelation that they could do
[1:24:53] it. Amen. Then finally a little shepherd
[1:24:55] boy walks in. Can you imagine standing
[1:24:57] maybe up on the hill you see the ranks
[1:24:59] of the Israelite soldiers and then
[1:25:00] across the valley there's the
[1:25:02] Philistines. You see Goliath standing in
[1:25:04] front of the Philistine army and
[1:25:05] bringing his boast and mocking Israel
[1:25:07] and mocking God. And then you see this
[1:25:09] little boy begin to walk through and the
[1:25:11] ranks begin to part and you know he
[1:25:13] begin to step through the ranks of
[1:25:14] Israelite soldiers. He steps out into
[1:25:16] the battlefield. Hallelujah. Where
[1:25:18] everyone was afraid. But there was one
[1:25:21] Amen. who had made a decision.
[1:25:24] He was going to he was going to end this
[1:25:25] thing. Amen. Where it was going to it
[1:25:28] was going to go more than a dream. It
[1:25:29] was going to become a reality. Amen.
[1:25:31] where the fate of Israel of just being
[1:25:32] stuck in this quagmire of a you know
[1:25:34] staying in this valley was going to be
[1:25:36] ended and the enemy was going to be
[1:25:38] routed. I tell you what friends. Amen.
[1:25:40] Adam's fallen race you and I were stuck
[1:25:42] in this thing where was the devil's
[1:25:44] boast and the devil's boast I'm going to
[1:25:47] get your family I'm going to destroy
[1:25:48] you. Amen. This word doesn't work for
[1:25:50] you. This message isn't real. Amen. But
[1:25:52] then one step forth. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] And I'm going to go from 2,000 years ago
[1:25:56] to today. But one step forth 2,000 years
[1:25:59] ago, he didn't look like he had any
[1:26:01] weapons to win a war, but he was
[1:26:03] carrying the greatest weapon. Amen. That
[1:26:05] was ever devised, which was the life of
[1:26:07] God. Amen. He stepped forth. Amen. He
[1:26:09] went to Galthther. He says, "I'm going
[1:26:10] to do it." Amen. He, you know, he walked
[1:26:12] through the ranks and he and he took
[1:26:14] down the devil and all the devils under
[1:26:16] him. He conquered hell, death, and the
[1:26:17] grave just like Goliath was defeated by
[1:26:20] by David. Amen. And David said before he
[1:26:22] killed Goliath, he says, "I'm going to
[1:26:24] kill you. I'll kill everyone here." you
[1:26:26] go read it. That's what faith does. And
[1:26:29] David just was expressing the revelation
[1:26:30] that he was carrying. And Jesus would
[1:26:33] would would be expressing the revelation
[1:26:34] he carried. He said, "No man takes my
[1:26:36] life. If I lay it down, I'll pick it
[1:26:38] back up again." Amen. And what he do? He
[1:26:40] conquered hell, death, and the grave.
[1:26:42] And friends, when brother said the last
[1:26:45] sermon he preached before he went on the
[1:26:46] fields was David facing Goliath. He
[1:26:49] says, "There's a lot of giants out
[1:26:51] there, but friends, I've been given a
[1:26:53] slingshot of faith. Amen. to prove that
[1:26:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:26:57] today, and forever. He says, "We down
[1:26:59] Goliath and we rallied around and God
[1:27:01] poured his spirit out." Hallelujah. I
[1:27:03] tell you what, friends, you're a
[1:27:05] generation of giant killers. That God
[1:27:07] has raised up, amen, as as an example
[1:27:10] around the world. That Jesus Christ
[1:27:12] lives. Amen. Jesus Christ is alive. That
[1:27:14] this message is true. That this message
[1:27:16] can change anybody. Amen. He has risen
[1:27:19] you up. Amen. as a group of giant
[1:27:21] killers to prove that Jesus Christ is
[1:27:24] alive.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that would have been a
[1:27:28] dream. It's like, did that really
[1:27:29] happen? Can you imagine after the dust
[1:27:31] settled, Goliath's heads being carried
[1:27:33] around, I mean, the Philistines are
[1:27:35] round and you say, did this really just
[1:27:36] happen? He did it. How did he do it? God
[1:27:40] did it. I mean, how on EARTH DID DAVID
[1:27:43] DO IT? YOU THINK WHEN he's walking there
[1:27:44] with a slingshot, you see Goliath with
[1:27:46] his armor and his you his armor bearer,
[1:27:48] what a loser that guy is. Paul, so he's
[1:27:50] on the wrong team. But you know, you
[1:27:51] think, how on earth is he going to do
[1:27:52] it? That guy's got a shield. He's got
[1:27:55] armor and and he's just a youth with a
[1:27:57] slingshot. How can he do it? But he did
[1:27:59] it because of revelation. He say he did
[1:28:01] it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Our God did
[1:28:04] it.
[1:28:05] Hallelujah.
[1:28:07] Amen. Here we are this day. Jesus would
[1:28:10] say, "No man takes my life from me. I
[1:28:12] got the power to lay it down. I got the
[1:28:13] power to take it up again." Amen. This
[1:28:16] commandment I've received of my father.
[1:28:18] Amen. and they would watch Jesus go to
[1:28:20] Calvary. They think, "How on earth could
[1:28:21] he do it?" I mean, can you imagine
[1:28:23] standing there? I I just think of it so
[1:28:24] often, you know, there's there's there's
[1:28:27] Peter, James, and John, and they were
[1:28:28] with Jesus up Mount Transfiguration. And
[1:28:30] there's Moses and Elijah. It says, I
[1:28:32] think in Luke in the account, it says
[1:28:33] that they would tell him the things he
[1:28:35] had to fulfill in Jerusalem. So, so they
[1:28:38] would take the word, Moses and Elijah,
[1:28:40] and would and would preach the word to
[1:28:43] the living word and they would tell him
[1:28:45] the prophecies that he had to fulfill.
[1:28:47] They couldn't do it. No man could do it.
[1:28:48] It would take a God man. And there he
[1:28:51] was standing there with them. And they
[1:28:53] would preach, you will be wounded for
[1:28:54] our transgressions. The chastise of our
[1:28:56] peace will be upon you. And by your
[1:28:58] stripes. Amen. We will be healed. Amen.
[1:29:01] You will be Amen. Your soul's going to
[1:29:04] go to hell, but it's not going to be
[1:29:05] left there. Amen. You are the seed of
[1:29:07] the woman. Amen. You are the one who
[1:29:09] we've been looking for. You are the true
[1:29:11] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:29:13] the world. has had a brief moment to to
[1:29:15] to tell the word what he's going to
[1:29:17] fulfill. I tell you what, friends,
[1:29:19] that's where I felt camp was. We had a
[1:29:21] couple of messengers come and they
[1:29:23] poured out to you. Amen. You're living
[1:29:27] in grace. Grace and faith is mixed
[1:29:29] together and is manifested in you. Amen.
[1:29:32] The civil war is over. Amen. The sheep
[1:29:34] are bleeding and the lambs are crying,
[1:29:36] but God has answered their cry. Amen.
[1:29:38] God has equipped you to to to meet their
[1:29:41] need. Amen. where there's a cry of
[1:29:43] someone, God's anointed you to fulfill
[1:29:45] that need in their life. Amen. And then
[1:29:47] they and then they've gone and camp's
[1:29:48] done, you know, but they they had that
[1:29:50] brief moment of time to speak. Amen. To
[1:29:52] encourage you. A friend, who felt
[1:29:54] strengthened from camp? I just felt such
[1:29:57] a strength. Amen. And that's what the
[1:29:59] word should do. Should strengthen us for
[1:30:01] for the for the continuation of the
[1:30:03] journey. Amen. But now, so they would
[1:30:06] prophesy that to the Lord Jesus. And you
[1:30:08] know, he went to Calvary and then, you
[1:30:09] know, the disciples did not understand
[1:30:11] what he was doing. But there was this
[1:30:13] thing, can he do it? It's one thing to
[1:30:16] heal the sick. It's one thing to raise
[1:30:17] the dead, but to take away sin, that's a
[1:30:20] whole another thing. Can he do it? He
[1:30:22] knew he could do it. Like David had a
[1:30:24] revelation, I can kill him. He's dead.
[1:30:26] He's mine already. Right? And Jesus had
[1:30:28] a revelation that that my soul, he'll
[1:30:31] not leave my soul in hell, neither
[1:30:33] suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
[1:30:35] He had that revelation. The prophet said
[1:30:37] he went to Calvary with one scripture
[1:30:39] and that was it that he would come out
[1:30:42] of the grave. And then so now here is
[1:30:45] here is you know they've gone to the
[1:30:46] tomb. You know, there's the first day of
[1:30:49] the week and you know, the disciples are
[1:30:51] going to the tomb and they're wondering,
[1:30:53] you know, they just, you know, the
[1:30:54] scripture says in Luke how they were the
[1:30:56] woman were carrying spices to anoint
[1:30:58] him, you know, to actually prepare his
[1:31:01] body properly for burial because it was
[1:31:03] a bit of a, you know, they felt it
[1:31:04] wasn't done properly. And here they come
[1:31:06] to the tomb and the stones rolled away.
[1:31:08] And, you know, because they were talking
[1:31:10] before they even came to the scene, how
[1:31:12] are we even going to move the stone?
[1:31:14] It's too big. HOW ARE WE PHYSICALLY
[1:31:15] going to do it? They didn't know the
[1:31:17] angel of the Lord had already come down
[1:31:18] that Jesus had resurrected and now
[1:31:20] they're living in the season of the
[1:31:22] resurrection and you know they because
[1:31:23] before this thing how can he do it how
[1:31:25] can we do it amen but then when they
[1:31:27] came to the tomb the stone was rolled
[1:31:29] away and Jesus was resurrected and there
[1:31:32] is Mary there and she's looking around
[1:31:33] to see and then turns and sees sees the
[1:31:36] Lord but thinks it's the gardener and
[1:31:38] and she says to him where where have you
[1:31:40] taken him that I can carry him away
[1:31:43] that's what she want to do carry his
[1:31:45] body away but She wasn't going to carry
[1:31:47] a body away. She was going to carry a
[1:31:49] message. Amen. That Jesus Christ is
[1:31:51] alive. Amen. And then after this, they
[1:31:54] would have realized he did it. Amen. He
[1:31:56] is my lamb. Hallelujah. I trust I trust
[1:31:59] this comes out how I feel right now.
[1:32:01] Amen. But you think about how on earth
[1:32:02] could he do it? It's like, are we in a
[1:32:04] dream? Imagine this scene. It's like,
[1:32:07] Lord, is that you
[1:32:10] Mary? Hallelujah. Her eyes came open.
[1:32:13] How? Amen. You ever had that feeling as
[1:32:17] the Lord had, you know, we're together.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; You know, there's incredible moments we
[1:32:23] look back and say, he did it. The Lord
[1:32:26] of glory, not just anyone, not a
[1:32:29] prophet, not a preacher, not a nice
[1:32:30] person or a Christian or what? He did
[1:32:32] it. He fulfilled his word. Amen. He is
[1:32:36] very interested in fulfilling his word
[1:32:37] in our lives. Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] Amen. You think, how on earth could we
[1:32:43] ever be free? that the same question
[1:32:45] could be settled in your heart. Has he
[1:32:47] done it?
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; He did it. Right? You think, Lord, how
[1:32:52] can I ever get to heaven? Did he do it?
[1:32:54] Has he anchored a revelation in your
[1:32:55] heart? I'm a child of God. I can't be
[1:32:58] lost. This rapture is for me. I'm under
[1:33:01] the blood.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; How did he get me there?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saved my soul. How did he
[1:33:10] do it? I I'm not doing this to be blas.
[1:33:12] I actually don't know how he found me.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; When I was running, he could run faster.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, anyone who's
[1:33:19] running, he can outrun them. Amen. He
[1:33:21] doesn't puff. He doesn't get a stitch.
[1:33:23] He doesn't get tired, he'll outrun that
[1:33:25] person. Amen. And the Bible says that
[1:33:27] goodness and mercy shall follow thee all
[1:33:29] the days of thy life. And that word
[1:33:31] follow means actually to pursue and
[1:33:33] overcome. So you got to have faith.
[1:33:35] Amen. For those who are who are running,
[1:33:37] Amen. Goodness and mercy are on their
[1:33:38] trail. Amen. And they're going to be
[1:33:40] overtaken by goodness and mercy. and
[1:33:42] goodness and mercy gonna pick that
[1:33:44] person up and bring them into the
[1:33:45] sheepfold.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Has he done it?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You know, if he did it once, he doesn't
[1:33:52] have like a I've only got three goes at
[1:33:54] this and then it's done. He does it
[1:33:56] forever.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He cannot change. You know, every
[1:34:00] divine promise of God is part of him.
[1:34:03] Many sometimes we think there's his
[1:34:05] promises and there's God. Then God
[1:34:07] fulfills his promises. He is his word.
[1:34:10] He is his promises, right? So it's not
[1:34:13] just something that's floating around.
[1:34:14] No, he is his word, right? So his
[1:34:16] promises are him. Amen. And by the
[1:34:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost, he's actually
[1:34:21] given you every divine promise. Amen.
[1:34:23] Whether it be healing, he's given it to
[1:34:25] you. Salvation, deliverance, amen, a
[1:34:28] peace that passes understanding, the
[1:34:29] power OF THE SPOKEN WORD. YOU KNOW, I
[1:34:31] was I don't have the pictures up here.
[1:34:33] This is a segue, but let's just write it
[1:34:34] for a little bit. You know, God has more
[1:34:36] than just saved us. You know, you think
[1:34:39] about like a soldier that was in a
[1:34:40] prisoner of war camp. Okay, if you get
[1:34:43] saved from the camp, that's a great
[1:34:45] thing. You're not in the camp anymore,
[1:34:46] right? You can go home to your homeland.
[1:34:48] You're not bound up by an enemy force.
[1:34:50] Okay? So, it's like we get saved from
[1:34:52] the powers of hell, right? We're not
[1:34:55] we're not under its control anymore.
[1:34:57] That's a good thing. But you take that
[1:34:58] soldier that's come out of the prison of
[1:35:00] war camp and you arm that soldier. That
[1:35:03] guy's dangerous now, right? He's more
[1:35:06] than just saved. He's empowered. He's
[1:35:08] equipped to take the fight to the enemy.
[1:35:11] Amen. And this is what this message
[1:35:12] does. It more than just saves us, which
[1:35:14] it does that, right? But now we're not
[1:35:16] walking around in this world with no
[1:35:18] weapons, no ability to fight. Amen. No.
[1:35:21] God has filled our mouths with his
[1:35:24] spoken word. Amen. It says the word is
[1:35:26] faith says the word is nigh thee in thy
[1:35:28] mouth even in thy heart. Amen. So those
[1:35:31] who have the anointing of the power of
[1:35:33] God are fully equipped to take the fight
[1:35:35] to the enemy. Amen. Who's with me this
[1:35:38] morning? Amen. What? So, we're not
[1:35:40] walking around without a weapon. No.
[1:35:42] We've been equipped by the power of the
[1:35:43] spoken word. Amen. Where God has put a
[1:35:46] two-edged sword in your mouth. AMEN.
[1:35:48] THAT WILL CHOP down every enemy. Amen.
[1:35:50] We'll take CARE OF EVERY PROBLEM. We'll
[1:35:52] bring peace to, you know, to anyone who
[1:35:53] needs peace. Will bring deliverance.
[1:35:55] He's equipped you with that. Amen. So,
[1:35:57] let God now take That's what happened on
[1:35:59] Sunday night. The sword came out.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I MEAN, THE SWORD CAME OUT
[1:36:05] AND IT'S NOT JUST A ONE hit you, it's
[1:36:08] not, you know, that's just not a
[1:36:09] one-time thing. That's every time. PULL
[1:36:11] IT OUT. LET GOD ANOINT your words. You
[1:36:13] got to believe what you're praying for
[1:36:15] and LET GOD TAKE CONTROL. AMEN. SO,
[1:36:17] FRIENDS, WE'RE NOT JUST WALKING AROUND
[1:36:18] IN A in a believer's uniform without a
[1:36:20] weapon. No, we have a two-edged sword.
[1:36:23] And he put that sword in your mouth, in
[1:36:25] your heart. Amen. It's like, you know,
[1:36:27] people say, "Where'd the sword come
[1:36:28] down?" Your sword came down in the
[1:36:30] prophet's hand, which was the word.
[1:36:31] Where did that sword go? went into you.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. For you to speak, for you to
[1:36:37] address your enemy.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Did he do it?
[1:36:41] Everything Adam lost has, he's restored.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Where did he restore it to? He restored
[1:36:49] you back to Adam's condition before the
[1:36:51] fall. Your soul now, not your body.
[1:36:54] Because God wants to show you it's not
[1:36:56] the state of your of your flesh. If
[1:36:58] you're sick, you're healed, you're well,
[1:37:00] your conditions that dictate faith. No,
[1:37:03] faith is far supreme above whatever
[1:37:06] you're going through. I was just talking
[1:37:08] to the Lord. I said, "Lord, if the
[1:37:09] Apostle Paul could have a can have a
[1:37:11] soldier chained to him and be in a
[1:37:13] dungeon and receive most of the New
[1:37:14] Testament, I think I'm in good
[1:37:16] condition." Amen. That you can put a
[1:37:18] revelation in my heart.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, whatever you're going
[1:37:21] through, you got to realize God would
[1:37:22] use Paul as an example that doesn't
[1:37:24] matter what you're going through, God
[1:37:26] can just pour in heaven. pour in heaven
[1:37:28] and create an atmosphere around you.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; He did it. You know, uh, brother Chris
[1:37:37] Moritz when I think when we were there
[1:37:39] in Canada or maybe he was here, I can't
[1:37:40] remember, but he just relayed to us
[1:37:42] about how him and Sister Brenda, they
[1:37:44] were they actually went to Mars Hill,
[1:37:46] you know, where where Paul saw the altar
[1:37:47] to the unknown god. And, you know, he
[1:37:50] said, you know, and it was quite a
[1:37:52] moment. He's just saying, you know, they
[1:37:53] bowed their heads and prayed and said,
[1:37:55] "Lord, thank you. The message got
[1:37:56] through.
[1:37:58] 2,000 years through persecution and the
[1:38:01] Bible, you know, the word trying to be
[1:38:03] buried and God, you know, the devil
[1:38:05] couldn't bury it. He couldn't, he
[1:38:07] couldn't take the truth. Amen. But the
[1:38:09] message got through. Hallelujah. Because
[1:38:11] the prophet said, "I preach everything
[1:38:13] Paul preached." And if you go examine
[1:38:14] what he preached, Paul preached the same
[1:38:16] thing. Amen. So the message came
[1:38:18] through. How did it do it? I don't know.
[1:38:20] But God did it.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, I won't be too much
[1:38:27] longer. Um,
[1:38:31] you think about the day of Pentecost.
[1:38:34] This is God.
[1:38:36] God. Say that with me. God
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; dwelling in man
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:38:43] How could he do it? We're all born in
[1:38:45] sin, shaped iniquity, come to world
[1:38:47] speaking lies. You know, it's like
[1:38:49] sometimes we, you know, people can
[1:38:50] think, well, he had the temple. The
[1:38:52] temple is, isn't that good enough? You
[1:38:55] know, like the disciples, you know, when
[1:38:56] they were there with Jesus before the
[1:38:58] temple and the disciples looked at the
[1:38:59] building and said, "Oh, what what great
[1:39:01] stones and buildings are here." And
[1:39:04] Jesus is standing there and he's looking
[1:39:05] at the stones. He's looking at the
[1:39:07] disciples. And in his mind, he probably,
[1:39:09] you know, you know, he could have, you
[1:39:10] know, I don't want to put words in his
[1:39:11] mouth, but he basically said, you know,
[1:39:13] he could have said, "Brothers,
[1:39:16] that building is nothing compared to
[1:39:17] you, cuz that's not what I that's just a
[1:39:20] temporary structure. You're the eternal
[1:39:22] one. You're actually what I'm looking
[1:39:24] for. Not this building. I I ordained
[1:39:26] that building and I wanted it there for
[1:39:28] a season, but it's just a shadow. We're
[1:39:31] not the shadow of the temple. The shadow
[1:39:33] of the temple is a shadow of us pointing
[1:39:34] to you. Amen. And so, but you think, how
[1:39:38] on earth could God dwell in man? Is that
[1:39:42] if I'm good enough, you could you could
[1:39:44] have a spotless life.
[1:39:47] That's not it.
[1:39:49] Then Jesus would have died in vain. If
[1:39:51] there was any way you think if there was
[1:39:53] any way humanly possible for us to live
[1:39:56] a life that would merit God dwelling in
[1:39:58] us, he died in vain.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Okay? So just just throw out all the
[1:40:03] legalistic ideas.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Kick them kick them to the curb. Grace,
[1:40:07] the world is cheapened grace, but the
[1:40:09] bride loves true grace.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's anchored into our
[1:40:13] hearts. We are saved by grace. It's a
[1:40:15] divine influence upon our hearts. It's
[1:40:17] reflection in our life. It's God's
[1:40:19] sovereignty to us. It's a supreme grace.
[1:40:22] Amen. So, so there's nothing in this
[1:40:24] life you can humanly do to merit God
[1:40:26] dwelling in you. You can't earn it. You
[1:40:28] can't work it out. You can't do nothing.
[1:40:31] Okay? All you can do is surrender.
[1:40:33] Believe his word. And so you think, how
[1:40:37] on earth can God live in us? Well, he
[1:40:39] did it.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; The blood did it.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The blood cleansed them. That that
[1:40:46] same blood that's cleansed you. Amen.
[1:40:48] had a bunch of you look at the people
[1:40:50] there. Peter tried to kill a guy. Half
[1:40:52] of them couldn't read. There's the woman
[1:40:54] at the well, Mary Magdalene. All these
[1:40:56] prostitutes and publicans and the
[1:40:58] outcasts of life. They had very
[1:41:01] checkered past. They had a very bad
[1:41:03] past. They did not have a sociably
[1:41:05] social sociably is that a word? Socially
[1:41:09] accepted past.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You think how on earth could God dwell
[1:41:13] in them? Oh, he did it.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:41:17] He did it, did he not? He He lived
[1:41:19] through them.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; And the same faith they have is the same
[1:41:22] faith we have received. The same God in
[1:41:24] them is the same God in you.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; If he can save them, he can save. He
[1:41:29] Well, he did it.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; He did it. His word came, his word came
[1:41:32] to them, gave them a faith, and they
[1:41:34] received the Holy Ghost. Amen. The same
[1:41:36] word has come to you. Amen. And you
[1:41:38] received that word. How did you receive
[1:41:40] it? I actually don't know, but he did
[1:41:42] it.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; How did you know? Because you think,
[1:41:44] well, why do you believe this? I don't
[1:41:46] know, but he did it. Honestly, I I not
[1:41:49] being like this to be blas. I just I'm
[1:41:51] just going because really, you think
[1:41:53] about it. Why are you here? I don't
[1:41:56] know, but he did it.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Why are you a belie? Why are you even a
[1:41:59] Christian? It goes beyond upbringing. It
[1:42:02] goes beyond culture. It goes beyond,
[1:42:04] well, I was raised in the message. It's
[1:42:05] far beyond that. It's God did it. Amen.
[1:42:08] God wanted to do it and he did it. Amen.
[1:42:11] God wanted to have an upper room and he
[1:42:13] did it. Amen. Amen. God wanted you
[1:42:15] washed in his blood. Amen. Hit away in
[1:42:18] Christ. Amen. Sealed to the day of your
[1:42:20] redemption. Amen. Living for him, loving
[1:42:23] him. He wanted it and he did it. Amen.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I believe it's the
[1:42:31] same thing for our children, those that
[1:42:33] are far off. As me as the Lord our God
[1:42:34] shall call. He wants it. He's going to
[1:42:37] have it. He's going to do it. AND WE'RE
[1:42:38] GOING TO HAVE PERFECT FAITH. WHAT DID
[1:42:40] BROTHER Jonathan Brother Jonathan said?
[1:42:42] Perfect faith is taking God at his word.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Well, how can you take him at his word
[1:42:46] and someone else can't? I don't know,
[1:42:48] but he did it in me.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did it in me. It's going to
[1:42:51] spread. Praise the Lord. He did it.
[1:42:54] Amen.
[1:42:56] Hallelujah. I like this. He says,
[1:42:58] "Hallelujah." Now, now he's speaking
[1:43:00] about the wave sheath offering here. I'm
[1:43:01] just wanting to jump in with this
[1:43:03] thought. I'm sure you can see what I'm
[1:43:04] talking about. It was waved over the
[1:43:06] people the first time will come forth
[1:43:07] for the bride age, for a resurrection.
[1:43:09] Our dark denominationalism will be a
[1:43:11] message that uh the full maturity of the
[1:43:14] word is turned back again in its full
[1:43:16] power and being waved over the people by
[1:43:18] the same signs and wonders that he did
[1:43:20] back there. Because I live, ye live
[1:43:22] also. Speaking to his wife, because I
[1:43:25] live, ye live also. What a resurrection
[1:43:27] that was. And what a resurrection this
[1:43:29] is. I tell you what, friends, he's done
[1:43:32] it.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He did it. Amen. We were all dead in
[1:43:35] trespasses and sins. Amen. And God has
[1:43:37] quickened us by the power of the Holy
[1:43:40] Ghost. Amen. He has done it. He did it.
[1:43:42] Amen. We're now alive in Christ. Amen.
[1:43:45] God's quickening power. I trust it's not
[1:43:48] just lingo to you, BUT HIS QUICKENING
[1:43:50] POWER HAS COME UPON YOU. AMEN. He's
[1:43:52] awakened you. He's opened your eyes of
[1:43:55] understanding. Amen. He's given YOU A
[1:43:56] FAITH TO believe for the impossible.
[1:43:59] HE'S GIVEN YOU A FAITH TO TAKE HIM at
[1:44:00] his word. He's given you a faith that is
[1:44:02] an OVERCOMING POWER. GOD DID IT.
[1:44:06] HALLELUJAH. AND NOW WHAT IS HE DOING? HE
[1:44:08] IS PROVING it that he's done it.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S LIKE DAVID WAS anointed by
[1:44:13] Samuel and then God was going to prove I
[1:44:15] did it. I mean, more than a prophet
[1:44:17] anointing him. It was God. You know,
[1:44:19] when the anointing oil came upon David,
[1:44:21] it said the spirit of God was with him
[1:44:22] from that day on. And what did he do
[1:44:24] now? He just took him as a as an example
[1:44:27] and put him before the people to say, "I
[1:44:29] did it. He's king."
[1:44:32] He already was king before he was
[1:44:34] anointed. The reason he was anointed
[1:44:36] because he was king.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You always were the bride.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; This message came to identify who you
[1:44:42] really are.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:44:46] That's what it's come to do. He's done
[1:44:47] it.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; He did it. Hallelujah. He did it. And
[1:44:51] then now what is he going to do? He's
[1:44:52] going to continuously prove through your
[1:44:54] life that he did it. I mean, it doesn't
[1:44:56] matter how sick you can get, how much
[1:44:58] trouble you can have, HOW BAD YOUR F
[1:45:01] WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN in your life, he's
[1:45:03] going to prove it in your life. I did
[1:45:04] it. Amen. That fa the faith I PUT IN
[1:45:07] YOUR HEART IS STRONGER THAN
[1:45:08] CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S STRONGER THAN
[1:45:10] TROUBLE, DISCOURAGEMENT, PROBLEMS,
[1:45:13] religious spirits, whatever it is, God
[1:45:15] is going to prove I did it.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That I've sealed you to the day of
[1:45:19] your redemption. He's going to prove
[1:45:20] that. Amen. every spirit. We're going to
[1:45:22] be tried by every spirit of this age,
[1:45:24] but God's going to prove no. They're
[1:45:25] mine
[1:45:27] cuz he did it.
[1:45:30] Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] Jesus would come to Nazareth where he
[1:45:34] was bought up as his custom was. He went
[1:45:37] to church. We want to be like Jesus. He
[1:45:40] went to the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:45:41] day, stood up for to read, and there was
[1:45:43] given to him the book of the prophet
[1:45:45] Isaiah. And when he had opened the book,
[1:45:47] he found the place where it was written,
[1:45:48] "The spirit of Lord is upon me because
[1:45:50] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:45:52] to the poor. He has sent me to heal the
[1:45:54] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:45:56] the captives and the recovering of the
[1:45:58] sights of the blind and set at liberty
[1:45:59] them that are bruised, to preach the
[1:46:01] acceptable year of the Lord." And he
[1:46:03] closed the book and gave it again to the
[1:46:04] minister and sat down. And the eyes of
[1:46:06] all them that were in the synagogue were
[1:46:08] fastened on him. And he began to say
[1:46:09] unto them, "This day is this scripture
[1:46:12] fulfilled in your ears." Now, we
[1:46:16] understand when when brother Brand was
[1:46:17] preaching birth painans, he was given a
[1:46:20] a brand new Bible by his wife, he went
[1:46:22] to open the scripture and and he
[1:46:24] couldn't find the scripture he was
[1:46:25] wanting to read. And he found out later,
[1:46:27] it was actually two pages were stuck
[1:46:29] together. And a and a and a Orthodox or
[1:46:32] Catholic priest stood up and actually
[1:46:34] gave him his Bible for him to read. And
[1:46:36] you can I think you can hear it on the
[1:46:37] recording. You you hear this priest say,
[1:46:39] "Be steady, son. God's going to do great
[1:46:41] things." And this is all going on. And
[1:46:44] then you know after the meeting you know
[1:46:46] him and his you brother Bram and his
[1:46:47] wife are talking and she was saying how
[1:46:49] she was so stressed and worried and
[1:46:50] brother I said no no I wasn't worried
[1:46:52] God was doing something and um and then
[1:46:55] after that you know the Lord spoke to
[1:46:57] him and brought him to this scripture
[1:46:58] here where it was given into him
[1:47:03] the word and now we are living and then
[1:47:06] now the second part all all this is
[1:47:08] being fulfilled right and then he would
[1:47:10] preach you go back to Jeffersonville and
[1:47:11] preach this day is the scripture
[1:47:13] fulfilled in your ears.
[1:47:14] Now he did it. Okay. But what blesses me
[1:47:18] about this is there has to be a living
[1:47:21] witness in every generation. Okay? Where
[1:47:24] the anointing of the Holy Ghost rests
[1:47:27] upon and fulfills this word. Okay? Cuz
[1:47:31] it's one thing to say because many
[1:47:33] people are stuck in the prophet's era of
[1:47:37] caught up in what God did in his life
[1:47:39] but just looking back saying, "I wish I
[1:47:42] was back there." As we heard on Monday,
[1:47:44] we're in 2025, right? The same God back
[1:47:48] there is the same God today. Amen. So,
[1:47:52] what blesses me about this is um you
[1:47:54] know, this this just came, you know,
[1:47:56] anchored into my heart, I think Monday
[1:47:57] when brother John was preaching is is
[1:47:59] this same anointing. Now, we can all
[1:48:02] testify now. Now, this is us as a
[1:48:04] people. People come, they're hurting,
[1:48:08] they're broken, they're lost, they need
[1:48:12] direction. They need stability,
[1:48:15] right?
[1:48:17] And they come here and what does God do?
[1:48:20] God pours an oil. He pours in the wine.
[1:48:24] He binds up their broken hearts. He sets
[1:48:26] them free. He heals them. He reveals to
[1:48:30] them who they really are.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's happened th this day, this
[1:48:36] scripture is fulfilled here.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He did it. The same anointing that was
[1:48:43] on the Messiah is on you
[1:48:47] individually and as a group. Praise the
[1:48:50] Lord. To me, that's phenomenal. Maybe
[1:48:51] it's just for me. I liked it. Okay. We
[1:48:54] got to realize we can say, "No, no, the
[1:48:56] spirit of laws is upon us.
[1:49:00] He's anointed us to preach the gospel."
[1:49:02] Now, when I say us, I'm talking about
[1:49:04] I'm not talking about I'm talking about
[1:49:05] all of us here because we're a body,
[1:49:07] right? There's not this is not a oneman
[1:49:10] band deal. We're a body of believers.
[1:49:12] God has brought together and God places
[1:49:15] us in that body and it's a beautiful
[1:49:16] thing to watch and be part of. Okay. So,
[1:49:19] he has he has sent us to heal the
[1:49:23] brokenhearted.
[1:49:26] I'm just stating the obvious of what's
[1:49:27] been happening for 13 years.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Okay? And he's doing it. Brokenhearted
[1:49:33] people have come in here and their
[1:49:35] hearts don't stay broken.
[1:49:38] People have been bound have been
[1:49:40] delivered.
[1:49:42] Right? People who can't see spiritually,
[1:49:45] their sight comes open.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And people who have been bruised, their
[1:49:50] spirits been crushed, they've been set
[1:49:52] free.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did it. You say, "How on earth
[1:49:56] did he I remember we were Christy and I
[1:49:58] were talking I can't remember where
[1:50:00] when, but recently about Oh, we're
[1:50:03] talking to that sister Cindy who came
[1:50:05] from Idaho. We saw her last week and on
[1:50:09] Friday, I think. Was it Friday or
[1:50:11] Thursday? The days just jumbled together
[1:50:13] the other day. I'll say it. And um
[1:50:18] where was I going with that? Oh yes. Cuz
[1:50:21] she was at a camp in America where
[1:50:22] brother Craig Bo was preaching and and
[1:50:24] we just shared with her. Well, you know,
[1:50:26] before we ever started church, we saw we
[1:50:28] we saw Brother Craig Boy and he was
[1:50:30] testifying of when he was young in the
[1:50:32] Lord, they had a three-year revival
[1:50:34] where he was living in America and they
[1:50:36] had 40 souls come in. And it gave us
[1:50:38] faith that if God can do it there where
[1:50:41] the message came from, he can do it
[1:50:42] here.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He did it. Hallelujah. And I'm not
[1:50:48] putting a number cap on that.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. As many need to come, come. Praise
[1:50:54] the Lord. But he did it. I remember when
[1:50:57] we first started church, we're thinking,
[1:50:59] what's this going to turn into?
[1:51:02] We didn't know. We just were walking out
[1:51:04] on a promise. But he did it.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has he not done it? And and he's
[1:51:09] not in the past. He's present this
[1:51:11] morning.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But isn't it wonderful? We think
[1:51:13] he did it. How did he do how did he do
[1:51:15] it?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:17] He did it. Amen. I just think you see
[1:51:19] brother Eddie the first service the node
[1:51:21] ever came to. Brother brother brother
[1:51:23] Kaben was song leading and uh I had this
[1:51:26] uh lung infection and and uh and the
[1:51:29] antibiotics were attacking my right knee
[1:51:30] as they do for some reason. I couldn't
[1:51:32] walk properly and we're at our first
[1:51:34] very first church location where rain
[1:51:36] would come through the ceiling get
[1:51:37] buckets of water through you know it was
[1:51:39] it was a special place
[1:51:41] and you think humanly how on earth could
[1:51:44] people ever
[1:51:46] come to the Lord here but he did it.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He did it. He hasn't stopped
[1:51:52] doing it. Praise the Lord. That was a
[1:51:54] great day. Amen.
[1:51:57] He did it.
[1:51:59] I'm just gonna
[1:52:02] let's just have the musicians actually
[1:52:04] this morning. I'm just going to finish
[1:52:05] there. I just want to finish with he did
[1:52:07] it and I'm so thankful he did it. I wish
[1:52:10] I could really share it, preach it. How
[1:52:13] you know, but you all know that feeling,
[1:52:15] right? In summary, Lord, how could you?
[1:52:18] You know, you go through a transition.
[1:52:19] Lord, how could you do it? Then he's
[1:52:21] doing it. It's like a dream and it's
[1:52:23] like the realization he did it.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like brother Bisll. We
[1:52:27] watched Brother Biscll's I'm a witness,
[1:52:29] the most recent one. As a family, we we
[1:52:31] did that for our family altar for a bit.
[1:52:33] And you know, Brother Biscll I don't
[1:52:35] know if it was in that one, but I
[1:52:36] remember him saying cuz he was the boy,
[1:52:38] you know, he was the young man with the
[1:52:39] green checkered shirt in the vision
[1:52:41] shooting the the silver tip grizzly bear
[1:52:43] in the caribou. He was he was in that
[1:52:45] vision. He didn't fully he didn't grasp
[1:52:48] fully that he was in the vision until
[1:52:51] finally when uh because in the vision
[1:52:53] there was um there was the the the the
[1:52:56] antler of the caribou was measured and
[1:52:59] there's a certain mark on the bottom of
[1:53:00] the antler to the top where they measure
[1:53:02] it and it was 42 in. And this is at the
[1:53:05] end of the vision. So the grizzly bear's
[1:53:07] been shot. They're carrying the caribou
[1:53:08] head in and um and I I don't know who
[1:53:12] had the measuring tape, but you know,
[1:53:13] Brother Brand staying there and there's
[1:53:14] Blaine, Brother Bud Southwick's son, and
[1:53:17] Bud Southwick and brother Ed Biscll's
[1:53:19] there. And you know, they measure the
[1:53:21] horn and it's exactly 42 in. And I don't
[1:53:24] know who said it in the um maybe it was
[1:53:26] brother Bud said it's 42 in. And brother
[1:53:29] Brandham just stood there. He says,
[1:53:30] "There it is." And then when he said
[1:53:32] there it is, brother Biscll realized the
[1:53:34] vision he was told he had lived through
[1:53:37] and he was there. He did it.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, friends, we're living in a vision.
[1:53:43] We are living in an unfolding vision of
[1:53:45] the word of God. We're living in it. And
[1:53:48] there'll come a day where it fully
[1:53:50] culminates. But there it is. And we'll
[1:53:53] realize we've been walking with our
[1:53:55] frustrations, with our trouble. You know
[1:53:57] how brother Bis got that green chicken
[1:53:59] shirt on? He fell in some water in that
[1:54:01] morning.
[1:54:03] That's how God caused him to fall into
[1:54:05] some water that he was dressed right to
[1:54:07] fulfill the vision. Okay? It's the same
[1:54:09] thing. We go through ups and downs. I
[1:54:10] know I get stressed about things and the
[1:54:13] girls got to live through that, you
[1:54:14] know. But all those things are for a
[1:54:17] purpose.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; God is fulfilling the vision of his word
[1:54:20] in your life. And we can stand this
[1:54:24] morning and say, "He did it." And he
[1:54:27] hasn't stopped.
[1:54:29] Amen. So, let's stand. Let's stand this
[1:54:32] morning. Amen. You got a you got a song
[1:54:34] there.
