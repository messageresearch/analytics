[8:56] &gt;&gt; Do we like it that we're all like in our
[8:57] same spots?
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Like, you don't want to like come
[9:02] forward or do anything, you know, end
[9:04] the year with a bang, bit of bit of
[9:07] pizzazz, bit of, you know, wow, let's
[9:10] like sort of
[9:13] let's break free. Let's do something
[9:14] different, you know? This is your last
[9:17] opportunity for the year. It's so once
[9:19] this once this day goes, you can't do it
[9:21] anymore.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Now, Jenny, you'll sit in that chair the
[9:26] whole next year. That'll be your new
[9:28] spot.
[9:30] Yeah. Find your position for next year.
[9:33] You got It's a chance to break free and
[9:35] bunker down.
[9:39] Yo,
[9:41] &gt;&gt; what?
[9:43] Yeah, maybe drunkers musicians can move.
[9:46] Wow. So that see that wasn't so scary. E
[9:50] how does it feel? Different view. Don't
[9:52] look different from there.
[9:59] That's better. It kind of feels a bit We
[10:00] just want to relax. It's kind of like a
[10:02] We want to be a bit more relaxed. Okay.
[10:04] that that we won't be too like
[10:07] too like formal is okay but
[10:12] so that this is a
[10:15] new year New Year's Eve is always a nice
[10:17] time because it's a time to like
[10:20] reflect. We we go through the year and
[10:23] it like July
[10:25] a certain day in July means nothing to
[10:27] us because we just in our minds even
[10:28] though it's just another day in the in
[10:30] the hemisph in in the the whole uh
[10:35] sort of montage of life.
[10:38] Today is no different than any other
[10:40] day. But we like to break things up and
[10:41] we have little segments and we have
[10:42] weeks and months and that. So then we
[10:44] break this up into our year. So to us,
[10:46] to a human being, it is significant and
[10:48] it's a time to we can look back and
[10:50] reflect and we can look forward and and
[10:53] I guess dream and and and have faith,
[10:55] you know, and look forward. It's a nice
[10:57] time to sort of stop and we all get to
[10:59] have our Christmas holidays and slow
[11:00] down a bit. So I think for me, I I've
[11:05] had the most fantastic year you could
[11:06] ever imagine. My year has been so epic.
[11:08] Like things have moved and shaken and
[11:10] happened and a lot of things have
[11:12] changed and it's all been it's all been
[11:14] for the better. I don't know if your
[11:15] year's been happen, but my I've had the
[11:17] most epic year you could ever imagine.
[11:18] And there was so much I've got so much
[11:21] on the horizon. Like even in the last
[11:22] month, so many things changed. A lot of
[11:24] things changed to to um
[11:28] Yeah, I finished a whole lot of projects
[11:29] and I've got a whole lot of new I've got
[11:31] a I've got a new project starting and
[11:32] it's so exciting and a lot of things.
[11:35] Yeah, I've had the most amazing year.
[11:37] Have you had a good year? Everyone else
[11:38] had a that's been epic, I think. And
[11:40] next year is going to be fantastic. It's
[11:42] going to be the I'm I'm speaking for
[11:43] myself, but I hope I'm speaking for you,
[11:45] too. We're going to have I think Brother
[11:46] Ben's had a great year, too. And I think
[11:48] we'll call it a seasonal thing, okay?
[11:50] We're all the same. We go one, we go
[11:52] all. If you're not having a good year,
[11:54] just quickly change. Oh, no. It's been a
[11:56] great year. I'm going to have it.
[11:59] Um, yeah. So, that's that. Yeah. This
[12:02] time I I think in the Lord we always
[12:05] have a good years, though. No matter
[12:07] whether you're whether you're slog or
[12:08] whether you're on a mountain or in a
[12:09] valley, we always grow in the Lord.
[12:12] That's the great thing about being a
[12:13] Christian. We always we become more
[12:14] positive. We be we we have more faith.
[12:16] We we get more wisdom. We get so many
[12:19] more things each and every year. I think
[12:20] if you look back to this time last year,
[12:21] you're a different person. You're
[12:24] different. And that's the privilege that
[12:27] we have of serving the Lord and
[12:29] surrendering to his spirit is that he's
[12:30] always working on us. And he's making
[12:32] all of you into masterpieces. You're a
[12:34] masterpiece. So, let's um let's stand.
[12:37] We'll sing a few songs and we've got a
[12:38] whole lot of um neat specials and
[12:40] testimonies. If you have one, like if
[12:43] you suddenly think of a testimony, but
[12:44] you're not on the list, you can just put
[12:45] your hand up and then we'll have to go
[12:47] before the elders and ask them if you
[12:48] can speak.

[39:18] This This is speaking about the
[39:19] drummers. Now, I've got a feeling
[39:20] Brother Josh may be streaming in tonight
[39:22] with a small little bead of sweat
[39:24] dripping down his brow.
[39:27] And Brother James is at the back there
[39:29] with one down the other side.
[39:33] Their little sharing routine they had
[39:35] going on maybe under threat.
[39:38] Let's some stand. We're just going to
[39:39] sing one song and then we've got some
[39:40] testimonies.
[39:44] I see a cloud like a man's hand. Start
[39:47] with the chorus.
[39:55] Well, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[40:02] I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[40:08] Oh yeah, I see a cloud like a man's head
[40:14] and I know, yes, I know it's going to
[40:18] rain.
[40:21] Any time when it was dry, not a cloud up
[40:26] in the sky, the children of God began to
[40:31] reason why.
[40:34] So they went to God's man because they
[40:38] didn't understand.
[40:41] He said, "Go look, it's written in the
[40:44] sky."
[40:48] Now they opened up the door.
[40:51] Every time they looked once more, a tiny
[40:54] cloud was rising from the sea.
[41:01] And they began to understand the time
[41:04] for rain was ahead.
[41:08] Just like God said it would be. I see a
[41:13] cloud.
[41:15] I see a cloud like a man's head.
[41:21] Well, I see a cloud like a man's head.
[41:28] I see a cloud like a man's head, but I
[41:34] know, yes, I know it's going to rain.
[41:41] So today, we have no fear. We know a
[41:45] cloud didn't appear. The prophet's
[41:48] dream, my bride goes through the door.
[41:54] Have faith and just believe. A new
[41:58] spirit you'll receive. Oh, the rain is
[42:03] truly going to pour. I see a cloud.
[42:08] I see a cloud like a man's head.
[42:14] I see a clown like a man's head.
[42:21] I see a cloud like a man's head.
[42:26] Oh, and I know, yes, I know it's going
[42:30] to rain.
[42:33] Now the bride is looking above for a
[42:37] chariot rain of love to fill their
[42:41] hearts to peace they never know.
[42:47] And this bride it will be God's
[42:51] unfolding
[42:52] mystery. The promised word
[42:56] has already been sold. I see a cloud.
[43:01] I see a cloud like a man.
[43:08] I see a cloud like a man.
[43:14] I see a cloud like a man.
[43:20] Oh, and I know. Yes, I know it's going
[43:24] to rain. I see a cloud.
[43:27] I see a cloud like a man's head.
[43:34] I see a cloud like a man's head.
[43:40] I see a cloud like amazing
[43:46] and I know Yes, I know it's going to
[43:50] rain.
[43:55] Amen. You can take your seats. Um this
[43:58] evening we've got a few testimonies. We
[44:00] have a testimony from Sister Rachel,
[44:02] then is it Ashley? You got you got a
[44:04] testimony, too? Yep. and then
[44:07] brother Fish and then Tabitha has a
[44:09] poem. So just as they are this is like
[44:12] an Oliver family.
[44:14] Man, you're sort of taking over in the
[44:16] song specials now. You're aiming eye
[44:17] buying up the testimony spot as well.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And they have a song special as a
[44:23] family. Wow.
[44:25] This is He's finishing strong, man.
[44:27] There's a thing about finishing strong.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Um so who is Sister Rachel? can start.
[44:36] Yeah. Okay.
[44:38] Just while they're coming up, I don't
[44:39] know if you noticed. So,
[44:41] this time last year, just as they're
[44:44] getting set up, this time last year, I
[44:46] ran a 42k marathon on this day. Just
[44:49] kind of inadvertently ran it. Shannon
[44:52] was like, "Oh, going for a 20k run in
[44:53] the morning." I was 30. Okay. And I
[44:56] thought my mind I thought if I'm going
[44:57] to run 30, might as well do 42. So,
[45:01] ran 42.
[45:03] But this year I can walk. See that? And
[45:06] I Sh I have this little bridge run that
[45:09] we do and I managed to walk the bridge
[45:11] run today. It took usually takes like 25
[45:13] minutes. It took us an hour but I walked
[45:15] there walked back like it was like but
[45:19] it's all about
[45:22] um context you know.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Okay bro
[45:28] saints. Um,
[45:30] I just wanted to say at the beach with
[45:32] my friends, the sons, um, we were
[45:36] planning by the river and crossing some
[45:38] currents and then me, my friend Telvin
[45:42] went through the car once and then he
[45:44] slipped and he got in the um, rapid and
[45:48] um, but he learned a lesson for um,
[45:53] pull pull things and um, he got caught
[45:58] by a big rock, but I got swept away. And
[46:01] then um but I remember to like float.
[46:04] God gave me a sign to stay stay like a
[46:07] starfish, float. And then mom was
[46:10] teaching after me and then she got me
[46:13] right at the end. So yeah, that's my
[46:16] testimony.
[46:25] Um, God bless everyone. Um, yes, I had a
[46:28] great year, Isaac,
[46:31] but also my worst one ever. Um, so, um,
[46:38] had a tough one. Um and
[46:46] hard to explain really, but um
[46:49] in June just kind of it felt like what
[46:52] you'd say kind of an atomic bomb like in
[46:56] your life or like a landmine I think
[46:57] because something that's always been
[46:59] there but you didn't know about it. And
[47:02] um so it went off and I didn't cope with
[47:06] it very well and I was pretty angry and
[47:08] hurt. Um
[47:11] and um
[47:14] so I had a few things but I think going
[47:17] through it all over the months um I
[47:20] could look back and see God perfectly
[47:22] designed it the whole way and um
[47:26] for the first point when I was first
[47:29] first couple of weeks um just being my
[47:32] angry little self um
[47:35] and I could feel well or God actually
[47:37] showed me like I was going slide into
[47:40] depression. Um, but like seven years
[47:43] ago, I was delivered from like panic
[47:47] attacks or anxiety attacks. And the Lord
[47:49] did that after a church service up in
[47:50] Tatanaki at a camp, I think. And and
[47:54] then seven years later now, knowing that
[47:57] um God showed me, oh, if you carry on
[47:59] down this, you're going to be depressed.
[48:01] and I could be like I had that faith
[48:03] that I'd already been um delivered from
[48:07] anxiety and so now I could kind of put
[48:10] it into action and it's like you had the
[48:12] choice like it was hovering there and I
[48:14] might have wallowed in it for a little
[48:16] bit but um I was able to know that I had
[48:19] the faith to kind of get rid of that and
[48:22] so that was one deliverance and then
[48:25] also I was kind of I' I'd got to a point
[48:28] where I didn't want to come to church I
[48:30] didn't want to talk to anyone And um
[48:33] and
[48:35] so that was hard, but and I kind of
[48:38] really want I was kind of saying to
[48:39] Lord, you know, I want something a
[48:41] miracle for this, you know, um I deserve
[48:44] a miracle for this. And um but um
[48:48] afterwards, I could look back and see
[48:50] where the miracles were. And it was um
[48:53] coming to church every week, every
[48:55] Wednesday and Sunday. And it was
[48:56] directly to my heart. um no matter who
[48:59] was preaching, even Jimmy, you know,
[49:01] like sometimes.
[49:03] And um but it was like God just knit
[49:06] that together for me in my heart and
[49:07] just kind of slowly but surely pulled me
[49:10] through. And um so I want to say the
[49:14] best year ever because I can look back
[49:16] and see that um it doesn't matter what I
[49:19] do. I think God kind of got rid of any
[49:21] of my man-made foundations and um and so
[49:25] he is the rock and everything I have is
[49:27] built on him and um so it was a blessing
[49:31] in disguise I guess and um so I'm
[49:33] grateful to the Lord. I'm grateful for
[49:34] the saints because there were um people
[49:36] that God put in to kind of help me
[49:39] through different things and the pastor
[49:41] we have, you know, Ben came and prayed
[49:44] with us and you know, it was like,
[49:47] you know, the Lord has it all in his
[49:48] plan. And so I'm grateful for that and
[49:51] just want to tell my testimony that the
[49:53] Lord's God has planned for our life and
[49:56] his plan for your lives and we're just
[49:58] here for the ride really. So um um God
[50:01] bless you.
[50:10] God is good. Amen.
[50:13] Um so um well as as you know a couple of
[50:18] years ago uh we moved to Wellington. um
[50:22] the the job that I had um the the
[50:27] company I was with um did a bit of an
[50:28] internal transfer and I to move um which
[50:32] was the initial um okay I felt from the
[50:35] Lord to come here. Um so we did that and
[50:40] it was about a year a year and a bit
[50:42] into that job. There was there was
[50:44] always um a bit of not so much turmoil
[50:47] but um bit of abrasiveness with the um
[50:50] with the um guys in charge of that
[50:53] branch. Um but after about a year and a
[50:57] bit it started getting um quite negative
[51:00] in the in the office. Um so I was um
[51:04] service manager there and the two we
[51:09] call them directors but they're branch
[51:10] owners of that branch um were sort of
[51:14] above me then there was me then there
[51:15] was the team and I found I ended up
[51:18] playing like P in the middle between the
[51:20] the the owners and and the guys. Um and
[51:25] and it's not a fun place to be when
[51:26] you're dealing with two guys who are
[51:29] also arguing with each other and then
[51:31] you get it and then you've got to deal
[51:33] with the guys who are arguing up. Um and
[51:36] then it it got um worse and worse
[51:38] progressively. Um so I was looking for I
[51:41] say a way out but obviously um we have
[51:45] you know the mortgage and and house debt
[51:47] and things. So, and a and a family to
[51:49] provide for. So, that's it. Sort of um
[51:52] head down, just carry on. Um and it got
[51:56] um quite quite negative. Um they they
[52:00] were having weekly catchups of how they
[52:03] wanted things done and how either I
[52:05] wasn't doing it or the guys weren't
[52:07] doing it the way they wanted to do it.
[52:08] And it was almost a way where anything
[52:10] that went wrong was instantly my fault
[52:14] or my my thing to fix. and it became
[52:18] I got down from it, right? Um so to make
[52:22] a long story short, I was looking for a
[52:23] way out. Um it got to the point where
[52:26] the boss of one of the owners of Excel
[52:29] atright came and met up with me and we
[52:31] had a lunch together and we were talking
[52:34] um and he heard my side of the story and
[52:36] was just basically trying to work
[52:37] through a way that would work best for
[52:40] the owners here and myself. um trying to
[52:43] trying to sort of keep keep me on board
[52:45] and and all that. So
[52:48] with that um I was I was still looking
[52:51] for a place to get out. So I saw a
[52:53] advertisement for the new company of
[52:55] I've I've got I'm with now. Um and I
[52:58] started talking to them with these talks
[53:00] with my old boss with these talks with
[53:03] my boss from Talanaki. And um it was all
[53:08] coming to to a head so to speak and it
[53:11] was like bad where I was. But then I was
[53:16] also talking to this new guy and the new
[53:17] guy and he took uh leave. He was away.
[53:20] He came back and then he was away again.
[53:21] And it took about 2 months um of me
[53:24] chatting to this potential new um um
[53:27] employer and he had another meeting with
[53:32] me and it was to get sort of days in
[53:33] there. So it was on the week and it was
[53:35] a Monday. I had to catch up with him and
[53:37] Rachel was talking to me as I was coming
[53:38] home. Did you get a job offer? No. No, I
[53:40] didn't. Stink. Okay. Um, and then the
[53:44] Tuesday,
[53:47] Wednesday, the Wednesday I had a call
[53:50] from my current employer saying, "I need
[53:52] to catch up. Come in at the cafe. We're
[53:54] going to we're going to have a chat."
[53:55] I'm like, "Okay, cool. Right. This is
[53:57] this is going to be fun." And basically,
[53:59] he sat me down and he said, "Look, um,
[54:01] we've had a couple of people leave. Um,
[54:03] it's not working the way we've got
[54:05] things at the moment. We're going to
[54:06] make a change.
[54:07] um we want to offer you to change from
[54:11] salary to wages and with that will come
[54:14] a a pay drop but if you do enough
[54:16] overtime we'll keep you up and we'll
[54:18] keep you in the office a little bit to
[54:19] do a few quotes but generally speaking
[54:21] you'll be back on the tools um because
[54:23] this is what suits our company this is
[54:24] what suits what we're doing and also
[54:26] having you in the office is another
[54:28] overhead with the less government so in
[54:30] a way it was a demotion without him
[54:33] saying it that way um at and then he
[54:38] said, "I I need an answer, you know, let
[54:40] me know." And I said, "Oh, come on. Give
[54:42] me give me to the end of the week. I
[54:43] need to, you know, sort things out sort
[54:46] things out." In the back of my mind, I'm
[54:47] thinking, I've still got this potential
[54:49] job offer coming in. Um and he said,
[54:51] "No, I want to answer tomorrow." So, I'm
[54:54] like, "Okay, cool." Um that's a bit
[54:56] rough. So, that Wednesday night as I was
[55:01] driving home thinking of Lord, what am I
[55:03] going to do? Um, this is this is a bit
[55:06] of a rock and a hard place and I'm I'm
[55:08] waiting for waiting sake and as I was
[55:11] driving in to turn into Silverstream.
[55:15] Um, I got a text from the um potential
[55:18] employer saying, "Hey, really enjoyed
[55:21] the um um our catchup. I'd like to send
[55:25] through a job application for you um
[55:28] employment agreement. Can you review it
[55:30] and and I'll send it through tonight?"
[55:32] And I'm like, "Oh, cool. Okay, that that
[55:34] will potentially help me for the chat
[55:36] I'm going to have tomorrow. Um so so we
[55:39] go um go home tell our age. Okay, cool.
[55:42] It's coming in. It's coming. Come to
[55:44] church and I mute my phone. No, I'm not
[55:48] looking at we're checking before church,
[55:49] right? Like did I get it? No, I didn't.
[55:51] So no, that's it. Um mute the phone
[55:53] after church. Check my phone. Still
[55:56] nothing.
[55:58] Oh great. Um, and as I'm driving home,
[56:02] um, M's like, "Oh, just send him a quick
[56:04] text. He may have forgotten him. Maybe
[56:05] he he's busy. You know how he is." I'm
[56:07] like, "Oh." Sort of, you know, he took
[56:10] around 9:30, right? So, I'm like, "Oh,
[56:12] okay. Fine." I sent him a text. And he
[56:14] instantly responded. He said, "Mate, I
[56:16] just sent it through to your email just
[56:19] before your text came in. I hit send."
[56:21] So, all right. answer. Pull over side of
[56:23] the road, get there, scrolling through
[56:25] the phone, go through the um the the job
[56:28] offer, and it's very agreeable. It's
[56:32] it's pretty much what I needed to be
[56:34] able to leave without losing anything
[56:36] and and gaining a few things. So, it was
[56:38] it was very good. There wasn't in there
[56:40] the type of vehicle I'd asked for. Not
[56:42] as much as it was it was an ask, but um
[56:46] there there was still the provisions of
[56:48] a vehicle. Um and and I just through
[56:51] that just to be able to walk in the next
[56:52] day and go to the bosses, no, I'm not
[56:54] going to take the job offer of um um
[56:56] sort of a supervisory type um on the
[56:59] tools role. I'm actually going to leave.
[57:01] and then and then going from there and
[57:03] then he came through with the vehicle
[57:04] and just everything came through and
[57:06] it's just been an absolute blessing and
[57:08] it's been a it's been a really so I just
[57:09] want to say thank you Lord for looking
[57:10] after even the little things cuz cuz I
[57:13] could have stayed where I was and it
[57:14] would have been rough and it would have
[57:15] been tough but um yeah to to come
[57:18] through that and to to get through it
[57:20] was it was really good. Um and in total
[57:23] I was at that branch for about two and a
[57:24] half years. So sort of that the span of
[57:27] the whole problem was about that long.
[57:30] But um God is good. Amen.

[1:01:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:13] God bless the Oliver family. It's been
[1:01:14] great to have you with us.
[1:01:20] We've got a Sister Tabitha. Where is
[1:01:23] she? Here we come up here, sister.
[1:01:25] You've got a poem for us.
[1:01:39] I was not planning to stand here but I
[1:01:42] had a change of heart. I don't know
[1:01:44] maybe God just pushed me and somehow
[1:01:46] this poem um it's been in my heart for
[1:01:49] quite some time and it's kind of ringing
[1:01:51] with everything everyone is talking
[1:01:52] about. So I believe that was God who has
[1:01:56] pushed me to say it. Um
[1:01:59] the title of the I know some of you
[1:02:02] maybe have seen this somewhere along the
[1:02:05] way in your Christian lives. Um it's
[1:02:07] footprints on the stand of 10. I'm not
[1:02:09] the one who wrote it, but it speaks to
[1:02:10] me dearly. Just before I say it, I'll
[1:02:13] just give a short testimony. Um I feel
[1:02:17] led to say that most of the time, I
[1:02:20] think we look at our destination or we
[1:02:23] we're made to see or to view life or to
[1:02:26] to to talk about our lives after we've
[1:02:29] reached somewhere where we can look back
[1:02:31] and say, "Oh, God has brought me this
[1:02:33] far." But sometimes,
[1:02:37] or rather let me say, I have learned
[1:02:39] that I need to still testify. I need to
[1:02:43] really still glorify him and still
[1:02:45] praise him and still thank him and still
[1:02:47] talk about him and testify in the
[1:02:51] process. And for me, that's why I'm
[1:02:54] here. Um,
[1:02:57] sometimes I think my life is like that
[1:02:58] one of Moses. He was brought up in
[1:03:02] Pharaoh's home. I had everything for 40
[1:03:05] years and then God decided nope. That's
[1:03:08] not why I brought you here out into the
[1:03:11] desert and rubbed everything off. Start
[1:03:14] from Aresh.
[1:03:17] And that's where God wanted him to be
[1:03:19] because that's where the real learning
[1:03:21] started for him to fulfill his purpose.
[1:03:25] Most of the time when we are through the
[1:03:26] deal that we just think like our life is
[1:03:28] over but that's when your life is
[1:03:30] starting. So um when I came to when we
[1:03:34] came to New Zealand, God gave me two
[1:03:36] songs and those two songs rang through
[1:03:38] the whole year of 2022. I did not know
[1:03:41] it was his message to me. The first song
[1:03:44] was
[1:03:46] the God who sees
[1:03:48] and the second one was get used to
[1:03:51] different.
[1:03:52] I had no idea
[1:03:55] why he gave me those two songs, but man,
[1:03:59] it's been different and it's still going
[1:04:02] different. But I am learning that in
[1:04:05] everything that I'm going through, those
[1:04:07] two songs have really, really reminded
[1:04:10] me all the time. It's never going to be
[1:04:13] the same way. Just like the way it was
[1:04:15] for Moses, it's going to be different.
[1:04:18] and I have to learn to accept the
[1:04:21] difference that he's trying to show me.
[1:04:24] So that's why I'm standing here because
[1:04:26] this poem really really st speaks a lot
[1:04:29] to me and I I believe it's speaking a
[1:04:32] lot to some of you because maybe you're
[1:04:33] also going through some of your own
[1:04:36] desert moments and as you go through
[1:04:38] that just remember when you know you
[1:04:42] cannot walk.
[1:04:45] This is definitely someone who is
[1:04:47] carrying you
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and those footprints you see at the back
[1:04:50] they're not your footprints. Yeah.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; So, I'll just say the poem.
[1:04:55] Um, and just before I say that, um, the
[1:04:58] other day I was listening to the message
[1:05:00] and, um,
[1:05:03] brother Neville started by reading, um,
[1:05:06] John 17
[1:05:08] and it really spoke to me because it was
[1:05:11] the prayer that Jesus was praying before
[1:05:14] he went back to heaven. And John chapter
[1:05:18] 17 verse10
[1:05:20] really sunk and sat with me. And he's he
[1:05:24] was praying and he said um in chapter
[1:05:25] verse 10 he said and all
[1:05:28] mine are thine and thine are mine and I
[1:05:33] am glorified in them. The just I just
[1:05:37] felt like it doesn't matter what I'm
[1:05:40] going through. It doesn't matter what I
[1:05:42] feel or how
[1:05:45] some I feel like a loser sometimes most
[1:05:47] of the time. But it doesn't matter how I
[1:05:50] feel. It doesn't matter how much of a
[1:05:52] depression I go through.
[1:05:54] I'm still his and that that's all that
[1:05:57] matters.
[1:05:59] One night a man had a dream. He dreamed
[1:06:03] that he was walking along the beach with
[1:06:05] the Lord.
[1:06:07] I think he'll use this one. Oh my gosh.
[1:06:10] Cannot see.
[1:06:13] I can Sorry, I cannot see. So, let me
[1:06:15] just use what I have here.
[1:06:18] Yeah, that's another change that
[1:06:19] happened.
[1:06:21] Okay.
[1:06:27] One night, a man had a dream and he
[1:06:29] dreamed that he was walking along with
[1:06:31] the Lord in the beach. Across the sky
[1:06:34] flashed sins from his life. For each
[1:06:37] scene, he noticed two sets of footprints
[1:06:40] in the sand. One belonged to him and the
[1:06:43] other to the Lord. When the last scene
[1:06:46] of his life flashed before him, he
[1:06:48] looked back at the footprints in the
[1:06:51] sand. He noticed that many times along
[1:06:54] the path of his life, there were there
[1:06:57] was only one set of footprints. He also
[1:07:00] noticed that it happened at the very
[1:07:03] lowest and saddest times in his life.
[1:07:06] This really bothered him and he
[1:07:08] questioned the Lord about it. Lord, you
[1:07:12] said that once I decided to follow you,
[1:07:15] you'd walk with me all the way.
[1:07:19] But I have noticed that during the most
[1:07:22] troublesome times in my life, there is
[1:07:25] only one set of footprints.
[1:07:28] I don't understand.
[1:07:31] Why is it that when I needed you the
[1:07:33] most, you will give me? And the Lord
[1:07:37] replied, my precious, precious child,
[1:07:42] I love you and I will never leave you.
[1:07:46] During your times of trials and
[1:07:49] suffering,
[1:07:51] when you see only one set of footprints,
[1:07:54] it was then that I carried you. God
[1:07:58] bless you.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand um tonight. Let's sing
[1:08:08] um He's still in the fire.
[1:08:13] He
[1:08:17] Yeah, we'll start with the chorus. Well,
[1:08:18] he's still in the fire. And he's walking
[1:08:22] in the flame. And he'll be there to help
[1:08:25] you when you call upon his name. Oh, and
[1:08:29] he can still delivery.
[1:08:32] Oh, mighty power.
[1:08:34] Even though it's good to know he's still
[1:08:37] in the fire.
[1:08:40] Well, my mama read a story from the
[1:08:43] Bible long ago about Shad Mac Shack and
[1:08:48] all the bad eagle how the wicked king
[1:08:53] may be thrown into the flame because
[1:08:56] they would not bow and then deny their
[1:08:59] father's name.
[1:09:02] Mama said the king stood high upon the
[1:09:05] balcony so tall. When he looked up, he
[1:09:09] was shocked by all the things he saw.
[1:09:12] Cuz he looked and he would find that
[1:09:15] lying upon the ground. But instead of
[1:09:19] three counting four
[1:09:22] around
[1:09:24] and I said, "Mama, wait a minute.
[1:09:27] There's one thing that I must know."
[1:09:30] Three
[1:09:32] came out and wear that mango. And I
[1:09:35] never will forget it. M cross the floor.
[1:09:40] These were the words I heard her say
[1:09:43] while shining through the door.
[1:09:47] He stom
[1:10:01] my power
[1:10:04] is good to glory still in the fire.
[1:10:09] Now my friend, you may be destined to
[1:10:12] face life's hottest flame, but I'm glad
[1:10:15] that I can tell you through the power of
[1:10:19] his name.
[1:10:22] You come through and you tell yesterday
[1:10:27] forever. God is still alive.
[1:10:30] He's still in the fire. He's still in
[1:10:33] the fire. He's walking in the rain.
[1:10:38] Yeah. to help you when you fall on his
[1:10:46] mighty power.
[1:10:52] He's still in the fire.
[1:10:55] He's still in
[1:11:01] there to help you when you call upon his
[1:11:04] name.
[1:11:05] He can still
[1:11:18] Amen.
[1:11:20] And if you can take your seats again, we
[1:11:22] have a song from um Sister Ping and then
[1:11:25] after that we have a testimony from
[1:11:27] Sister Shannon. And if anyone else has a
[1:11:29] testimony, you can jump in that little
[1:11:30] spot there too.
[1:12:14] But come Mod
[1:12:44] is
[1:12:48] deep.
[1:12:53] How it see
[1:13:03] how it
[1:13:06] Oh
[1:13:09] my city.
[1:13:14] Oh sh
[1:13:35] may
[1:13:44] Shalom saints. Um just wanted to give
[1:13:47] God the glory um for taking us through
[1:13:52] the year up until this day. It was a
[1:13:55] colorful year. Um it was not a bad one.
[1:13:58] It was just colorful, different colors
[1:14:01] for every season, for every time. and
[1:14:04] for all the colors that he has blessed
[1:14:07] us with. We just want to say thank you
[1:14:10] Lord. We bless your name and we praise
[1:14:12] you. Thank you.
[1:14:33] Pick a color. Do you guys remember when
[1:14:35] the old church we used to just stand in
[1:14:36] the circle and we weren't filmed.
[1:14:40] I kind of like that a little bit better.
[1:14:43] A little bit less formal. Um but um
[1:14:48] okay. So Isaac asked me to give a
[1:14:50] testimony. So, I said no at first
[1:14:52] because I'm really bad at them. Um I can
[1:14:55] I
[1:14:58] have trouble composing myself. So, um he
[1:15:03] Yeah. So, then he went on and did some
[1:15:06] specials and I thought, "Oh man, I don't
[1:15:07] want to let the team down. I will give a
[1:15:09] testimony." So, bear with me. Um
[1:15:13] this year has been a great year. As
[1:15:15] Isaac says, every year is great. Um, I
[1:15:18] think we can make a movie about our own
[1:15:20] life. Um, mine and my children's and
[1:15:23] Isaac's and I look forward to that one.
[1:15:25] Um, but the movie would be really cool
[1:15:28] and dramatic and we have our ups and
[1:15:30] downs and you know, how are we going to
[1:15:31] get through this? Oh, it's just about to
[1:15:34] go down and boom, something happens and
[1:15:36] then God's there. He's always there. Um,
[1:15:39] so
[1:15:41] I guess my testimony, I had to pick one
[1:15:43] because it's very hard to choose. uh
[1:15:46] would be the two things. Um Isaac when
[1:15:49] we for Christmas we sat around the
[1:15:51] Christmas table and had breakfast by my
[1:15:53] lovely daughter who is like Mrs.
[1:15:55] Christmas. She's amazing. And she gave
[1:15:57] us Christmas breakfast cooked it all for
[1:15:59] us. And Isaac sat around and said,
[1:16:01] "What's the two things that you
[1:16:02] appreciated about the year?" So we all
[1:16:04] had to think of one think of two, sorry.
[1:16:06] And then I thought of my two. Now I'm
[1:16:10] going to go back prior to this. This is
[1:16:12] a couple years ago. um quite a few years
[1:16:15] ago. Praise God. I'm glad it's over. But
[1:16:18] um so I stopped I I did Sunday school
[1:16:21] for a while and I really really liked
[1:16:23] it. Loved the children.
[1:16:25] Um we had um what do you call them? Pop
[1:16:30] gun. You know those what are they
[1:16:32] called? Guns. Those
[1:16:34] snap guns that that No, no. The ones
[1:16:37] that you go click and it goes and
[1:16:39] sparks.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Cap guns. So we had cap guns and helmets
[1:16:43] and swords and shields. It was great. It
[1:16:47] was loved it. Um but then it came time
[1:16:49] to um when some of my children, well my
[1:16:53] my eldest son especially, God bless him.
[1:16:56] Uh he went through the eldest son phase
[1:16:58] and I always told him it was
[1:17:00] experimental. I've never been a mother
[1:17:01] of um a teenager and then he's never
[1:17:04] been a son, you know. Yeah. Never never
[1:17:07] been that age. Um and then so I went
[1:17:09] through the teenage years. They freaked
[1:17:10] me out. I'm just letting you know, every
[1:17:12] mom and dad should have a metal around
[1:17:14] their neck when they go through the
[1:17:15] teenage years. Um, and when it started
[1:17:19] getting quite bad, um, I let relented my
[1:17:24] duty of um, Sunday school because I
[1:17:28] thought, well, if I can't keep my house
[1:17:30] in order, how can I teach Sunday school?
[1:17:35] So, I um decided, okay, it's not for me.
[1:17:40] But I think it was a give up. And if I
[1:17:43] had to do it over again, I would
[1:17:44] definitely stay strong and stay in
[1:17:48] what I felt to do. So I do want to
[1:17:51] encourage anybody who's going through
[1:17:54] a hard time with their children to stand
[1:17:57] fast and to always just come to church
[1:18:00] and do what the Lord has called you to
[1:18:02] do.
[1:18:04] Don't ever relent because we've got an
[1:18:07] enemy who wants us to and he'll try
[1:18:10] everything he can to do it. But stand
[1:18:13] fast because there's a promise.
[1:18:17] And now I'm on the other side where I
[1:18:20] get to see that promise sitting in
[1:18:21] church. And um it definitely was not
[1:18:25] easy, but I was so encouraged by brother
[1:18:27] Brennham's testimony. He had to go
[1:18:29] through the same thing. And man, he was
[1:18:31] on a greater scale. play. He was in
[1:18:32] front of the world's eye and he had to
[1:18:34] go through it with his son. And not only
[1:18:37] did it hurt him to see his son go
[1:18:38] through it, but man, he had he just went
[1:18:41] through a lot. Um, and uh, so I in some
[1:18:45] of his sermons, I'm like, man, if he can
[1:18:47] do it, then so can I. I'm so glad the
[1:18:49] Lord gave him those testimonies so that
[1:18:52] we can have them as well.
[1:18:54] Um so this year um I started took up
[1:19:00] Sunday school again and I realized that
[1:19:03] it's maybe half for the children but the
[1:19:05] other half is for me. So so I was so
[1:19:08] blessed and I was so much fun. Uh but
[1:19:11] two two two things that happened this
[1:19:14] year which was real special to me that
[1:19:15] the Lord spoke to me um through the
[1:19:18] Sunday school. Uh, one was was teaching
[1:19:21] the children um that the Lord gives you
[1:19:24] the desire of your heart and that you
[1:19:27] can ask him for things and he will grant
[1:19:30] them to you. Maybe not in the time frame
[1:19:31] that we think they will, but he always
[1:19:33] remembers, you know, our desires and
[1:19:35] those uh wants um or something that we
[1:19:38] ask for. Uh and then after that I um you
[1:19:44] filming me, Noel? Okay, good.
[1:19:49] She just has her camera up. She probably
[1:19:50] is. Um the uh after that I got I had two
[1:19:55] grandfathers die this year. Um one a
[1:19:58] week afterwards um of each other and I
[1:20:02] really felt I wanted to go back home
[1:20:04] after the first one died, but then the
[1:20:05] second one I really wanted to go back
[1:20:07] home um because I wanted to see my
[1:20:10] family members that were still alive and
[1:20:12] I only make it back home maybe uh every
[1:20:15] 10 years. So I thought, man, if I wait
[1:20:18] another 10 years, it's going to be, you
[1:20:20] know, who's going to be left. So um
[1:20:23] there were a few things I I prayed to
[1:20:25] the Lord and I asked him and I asked for
[1:20:27] some uh fleces. One of them was
[1:20:29] financial be able to afford it
[1:20:32] financially and then the Lord provided
[1:20:34] financially through a family member. Um
[1:20:37] and another there was a few other fleces
[1:20:40] and they happened to uh come about. So,
[1:20:42] I knew it was of the Lord because it was
[1:20:44] quite a busy time for us at the the
[1:20:46] factory, but um I really had a desire to
[1:20:48] go back and especially see my grandma
[1:20:50] who I hadn't seen in a while and she was
[1:20:52] 80 she's 85. Um and when I went so I Oh
[1:20:57] man, it was so amazing. my passport. I
[1:20:59] didn't have my passport and then I had
[1:21:01] to get an emergency one and it came just
[1:21:03] in time and that was the same day the
[1:21:04] money came through so I could buy a
[1:21:06] plane ticket and leave the next week and
[1:21:08] it was just it was just you know you
[1:21:10] know when it's a God stamp on it. So I
[1:21:12] went over there and I had a wonderful
[1:21:14] time with my family and wouldn't believe
[1:21:17] this. Okay, so so I had done all my
[1:21:19] crying before I went there so it was
[1:21:20] more of like a catch up with my family.
[1:21:22] My mom, my grandma is 85 years old and
[1:21:25] so she had been looking after my
[1:21:27] granddad who passed away. Uh but she'd
[1:21:30] been homebound for quite some time uh
[1:21:32] just looking after him. But they were
[1:21:34] always out doing stuff. They were always
[1:21:36] like camping or you know very um active
[1:21:40] people even in their later years until
[1:21:42] he got sick. So my brother ended up
[1:21:45] talking to my uncle who arranged a
[1:21:47] whitewater river rafting trip and I went
[1:21:51] on a whitewater river rafting trip with
[1:21:52] my 85 years old grandma and it was so
[1:21:56] much fun. she was going woohoo and like
[1:22:00] oh it was just it was the highlight of
[1:22:02] of my year and and um and then I
[1:22:06] remembered while we were on the the raft
[1:22:09] because I'd been so busy all year with
[1:22:12] the factory and and everything was just
[1:22:14] always busy. So and I got to I just got
[1:22:16] to sit there and just enjoy and and and
[1:22:19] I love the outdoors. I yeah I was in an
[1:22:21] outdoors program at the university and
[1:22:23] we got to do all these things and I had
[1:22:25] signed up to do a whitewater river
[1:22:26] rafting um adventure but then I came to
[1:22:29] New Zealand so it was always kind of on
[1:22:31] my bucket list uh to do and while we
[1:22:34] were on the river rafting trip and I had
[1:22:35] forgotten this ages ago while we were on
[1:22:37] the uh river I was like he remembered
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and this is this is going back 20 years
[1:22:44] ago he remembered but I always wanted to
[1:22:47] do it and I got to do it with my
[1:22:48] 85-year-old grandma
[1:22:50] So that was so so special and I I
[1:22:52] remember teaching the children prior to
[1:22:54] that thinking he doesn't forget those
[1:22:56] things. He remembers everything. And
[1:22:58] then the next thing was um
[1:23:01] uh I taught I was teaching the children
[1:23:03] about gifts and callings and really
[1:23:05] seeking not the worldly things. Our
[1:23:08] desire shouldn't be for houses and other
[1:23:10] things. They're going to pass away. Can
[1:23:11] I just tell you I think houses are so
[1:23:13] dumb. They're just dumb. Like if you're
[1:23:15] spending your whole life to get a house,
[1:23:17] I just think it's the dumbest thing.
[1:23:19] Like I I'm gonna be honest. Like I go to
[1:23:21] America and I see all the big trucks. I
[1:23:24] see all the big houses and I see
[1:23:26] emptiness.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody's happy. And so I've never
[1:23:29] desired the houses or the things of of
[1:23:33] this world. And what has always been
[1:23:36] well when I was teaching the Sunday
[1:23:37] school, I was like, man, what what is
[1:23:39] your biggest accomplishment is finding
[1:23:42] your gift and calling, finding your
[1:23:43] calling in this life. you know that that
[1:23:46] and and then you and then you go and do
[1:23:47] it and then the Lord is pleased with you
[1:23:49] and then you get to heaven and you're
[1:23:51] like woo there's my house there's all
[1:23:53] this stuff you know I get to be here for
[1:23:55] eternity that's when we get it but
[1:23:56] anyways that's my um and so I was
[1:24:00] telling the children this and I was
[1:24:01] saying gifts and callings and then I
[1:24:04] think Isaac shared the testimony that we
[1:24:05] went up the mountain and I always was a
[1:24:07] support to Isaac um went up the mountain
[1:24:10] I always thought I'll support him on his
[1:24:12] ventures you know let's go yeah I'm
[1:24:14] following behind you and sometimes the
[1:24:16] terrain is treacherous and I'm like yeah
[1:24:19] okay let's go. Yeah, I'm following.
[1:24:21] Yeah, I really want to come. And um so
[1:24:25] that's kind of been our our walk. Yeah,
[1:24:28] I'm right behind you. Yeah. And on our
[1:24:31] walkway like I cut my tights and I and I
[1:24:34] was in my white shoes. I think you
[1:24:36] shared the testim in my mind. I'm going
[1:24:38] this is so stupid. What am I doing? I
[1:24:41] had a trail. The trail was nice
[1:24:45] and so but it reenacted. It was quite
[1:24:48] cool because it reenacted probably most
[1:24:51] of our life, would you say? And I'm
[1:24:53] doing this together. And then we get to
[1:24:55] the top and I see my name there and the
[1:24:57] year I was born and I was like and it
[1:24:59] dawned on me, this is actually my
[1:25:02] calling. I'm not just supporting him.
[1:25:04] This is what God's called me to do. I'm
[1:25:06] here with him doing it. So um uh and
[1:25:09] then and then the movie came about. we
[1:25:11] were able to finish it this year and now
[1:25:13] I don't just feel like a support. I'm
[1:25:15] like, "Yeah, that's our movie. This is
[1:25:17] what we're doing." So, it um those are
[1:25:19] the the two things that were really
[1:25:21] special about this year. So, I look
[1:25:23] forward to the next year and it's
[1:25:24] probably going to be a battle like every
[1:25:26] other year, but at the end I'm like,
[1:25:28] "Yes."
[1:25:29] As Isaac would say, "Bring it on. I'm
[1:25:32] ready."
[1:25:34] So, I'm ready for the next year and and
[1:25:36] um looking forward to the years ahead
[1:25:38] because um yeah, it's exciting being a
[1:25:41] Christian. It is so exciting and I am so
[1:25:45] happy teaching Sunday school and staying
[1:25:46] in your spot. So, yeah, to all the
[1:25:48] parents out there, you deserve a gold
[1:25:50] medal around your neck. Keep going and
[1:25:52] go stronger than ever before. Okay, God
[1:25:55] bless you.
[1:26:04] We got a little open mic session. Anyone
[1:26:06] have a testimony they'd like to share?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Just
[1:26:13] okay. Yeah.
[1:26:16] Anybody want? You want piano?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Can we get her a mic? Yeah. Let's get a

[1:31:10] I really like sister K.
[1:31:20] She's honest with me.
[1:31:27] I'm so naughty sometimes. I think cuz I
[1:31:30] know I look I know in my heart there's
[1:31:32] ways I do songs and sister K hates it
[1:31:34] when I do it like that. It's like
[1:31:35] there's older songs that you got to do
[1:31:36] it a certain way and I'm like I can't
[1:31:38] like that way. So I change the beat,
[1:31:40] right? She hates it. So, so one night I
[1:31:44] was sitting, you know, I should really
[1:31:46] be in a more spiritual mode, but I'm
[1:31:47] sitting at home going through these
[1:31:49] songs and I think, I want to do that
[1:31:50] song. And I think, oh, Sister K like
[1:31:53] that.
[1:31:54] A little laugh, you know. And then I
[1:31:58] come to church and I look around, I
[1:31:59] think, yes, she's not here today.
[1:32:02] You know, she must been away. And she
[1:32:05] streamed into the service and I'd said,
[1:32:07] "Oh, it's just a case not here. I can do
[1:32:08] the song this way." And she was
[1:32:09] streaming in. She said she almost threw
[1:32:11] the remote at the screen or something.
[1:32:16] And boy oh boy did I get it when she got
[1:32:17] back in a nice way. That's good. I like
[1:32:21] it. She She's honest with me and she
[1:32:23] gives me good feedback. It's good. I
[1:32:26] like it. I really like Sister K.

[1:33:46] at the time.

[1:38:43] Good evening to you all.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; The precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:47] Christ.
[1:38:49] It's good to be here.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the end of 2025.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] Um,
[1:39:02] I just want to say a few things.
[1:39:04] maybe that will bless us.
[1:39:07] Um
[1:39:11] we'd like to read from
[1:39:17] John 3:1 16
[1:39:20] familiar scripture.
[1:39:33] Verse
[1:39:38] 16 and 17.
[1:39:41] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:39:45] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:39:49] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:39:52] have everlasting life.
[1:39:56] For God sent not his son into the world
[1:40:00] to condemn the world, but that the world
[1:40:02] through him might be saved.
[1:40:07] For a word of prayer.
[1:40:11] Lord God Almighty,
[1:40:13] we are so thankful, Lord, to be in your
[1:40:16] house this evening.
[1:40:18] We just pray, Father God, that the words
[1:40:21] that have been read, you might give us
[1:40:23] something to think about, something to
[1:40:27] help us as we go along, as we carry into
[1:40:31] 2026.
[1:40:32] Help us, Lord Jesus Christ. May I anoint
[1:40:35] the few words of exaltation in Jesus
[1:40:38] Christ's holy name. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:42] You may be seated.
[1:40:50] You know, there's something about
[1:40:51] preachers.
[1:40:53] One time I I got to a place I'd
[1:40:57] had no intention to there. I'd actually
[1:41:00] gone to buy a car
[1:41:04] and uh it was just at the border.
[1:41:05] There's a pastor there. Then he tells
[1:41:08] me, "Brother, you will not go back till
[1:41:10] you preach to us."
[1:41:13] I know Bible. I had no nose sight
[1:41:16] nothing.
[1:41:18] So he said I'll take care of that.
[1:41:22] So after I preached then he said well
[1:41:25] now you can go.
[1:41:30] I' I'd like just to talk about the love
[1:41:32] of God expressed.
[1:41:35] Amen. The love of God expressed.
[1:41:40] Now when God loved
[1:41:44] He gave.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; When he gave,
[1:41:54] he didn't just give part of what he had.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; He gave all
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; that he had.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And there was his only begotten son.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't have many. so that it would
[1:42:12] remain with others.
[1:42:15] He gave the only one he had.
[1:42:20] He was prepared
[1:42:22] to lose that one
[1:42:25] because he had many other sons and
[1:42:28] daughters
[1:42:30] that he could not fellowship with
[1:42:33] because they were in captivity.
[1:42:38] When you go to Romance,
[1:42:51] Romans chapter 8 verse 29.
[1:43:01] For whom he did forno, he also did
[1:43:05] predestinate
[1:43:07] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:43:12] that he might be the first born among
[1:43:17] many brethren.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:22] That's why God had to give away his only
[1:43:26] begotten son so that you would be able
[1:43:29] to get the other sons.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:43:36] when you love you give
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You just don't love and stand still.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You go a further that is to give. Amen.
[1:43:51] We also here in Ro Hebrews chapter 2
[1:44:11] verse 19 verse 9-4
[1:44:17] but we see Jesus who was made a little
[1:44:19] lower than the angels, for the suffering
[1:44:24] of death, crowned with glory and honor,
[1:44:29] that by the grace of God, should taste
[1:44:32] death for every man. For it became him,
[1:44:37] for whom are all things, and by whom all
[1:44:41] things, in bringing many sons
[1:44:46] unto glory, to make the captain of their
[1:44:51] salvation perfect through sufferings.
[1:44:54] For both he that sanctifieth, and they
[1:44:59] who are sanctified are all of one, for
[1:45:04] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[1:45:07] them brethren.
[1:45:10] Hallelujah.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy to know that Jesus is
[1:45:15] not ashamed
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; to call us brothers, his brothers and
[1:45:21] his sisters?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] Saying, I will declare thy name unto my
[1:45:29] brethren in the midst of the church. Uh
[1:45:33] will I sing praise unto thee, and again
[1:45:38] I will put my trust in him, and again,
[1:45:41] behold, I and the children which God
[1:45:47] hath given me. For as much then, as the
[1:45:51] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:45:54] blood, he also himself likewise took
[1:45:58] part of the same, that through death he
[1:46:02] might destroy him that had the power of
[1:46:05] death, that is the devil.
[1:46:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Now verse 17
[1:46:15] of John chapter 3.
[1:46:25] He says, "For God sent not his son into
[1:46:29] the world to condemn the world."
[1:46:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Love does not condemn.
[1:46:39] Are we together?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; If you've got true love, you don't
[1:46:44] condemn.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; The world was evil.
[1:46:49] God saw it. But the love that was in him
[1:46:55] could not make him condemn that world.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; He loved it.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; When we see the the sinner, it doesn't
[1:47:04] matter what state he is in. All right.
[1:47:08] You look at him. You look at her.
[1:47:11] Do you condemn?
[1:47:15] She could be that wicked. He could be
[1:47:17] that wicked. But
[1:47:21] if we've got the love of God,
[1:47:24] Amen. We don't condemn.
[1:47:27] Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; We still have got hope for that person.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; We love that person.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You know, many times when I look at
[1:47:33] people, doesn't matter how they look.
[1:47:37] Something just says to me, "That's a
[1:47:40] precious soul.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; That's a precious soul." It could be a
[1:47:45] drunkard. It could be a gambler. Could
[1:47:48] be anything. But when you look at that
[1:47:50] person, you say, "That's a precious
[1:47:52] soul." You don't condemn.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; But if you are self-righteous,
[1:48:00] you condemn.
[1:48:04] That's what self-righteousness does. It
[1:48:06] condemns.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You remember that um that Pharisee in
[1:48:10] the temple.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:14] Lord, I thank you. I'm not like other
[1:48:17] people. I'm not an extortioner. I'm not
[1:48:19] like this and that. I pay my tithe. I
[1:48:22] fast twice a day uh a week. Is that
[1:48:26] right? I'm not like that sinner over
[1:48:28] there.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Self-righteousness.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You're condemned.
[1:48:36] So once you begin to feel that spirit in
[1:48:40] you, when you see somebody that's in the
[1:48:42] wrong, just begin to think, what do I
[1:48:47] have?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; The love of God or my selfrighteousness.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Now Christ on the cross, what did he
[1:48:58] say? Father,
[1:49:00] forgive them.
[1:49:02] They don't know what they're doing.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; That's love.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't condemn. He didn't say,
[1:49:09] "Father, you destroy them."
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that. Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; The love that was in him.
[1:49:20] It said
[1:49:22] forgive them.
[1:49:24] Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; So out of God's love is forgiveness.
[1:49:32] Hallelujah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; You can't say you love somebody if you
[1:49:36] fail to forgive that somebody. It's
[1:49:39] impossible.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. For parents, you can't say you
[1:49:43] love your children when you fail to
[1:49:45] forgive them.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; For husbands and wives, you can't say
[1:49:49] you love your spouse if you fail to
[1:49:52] forgive them.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] Hallelujah.
[1:50:00] So how how can we be saved if you're not
[1:50:04] forgiven?
[1:50:08] So forgiveness is an expression of love.
[1:50:13] Amen.
[1:50:16] Now when God gave his only begotten son,
[1:50:20] he made him to be sin for us.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:50:26] He took our place so that we will take
[1:50:30] his
[1:50:32] place.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Now when he was in the hands of the
[1:50:38] Roman soldiers,
[1:50:40] he was bitten, mocked,
[1:50:43] stripped naked, killed, and then buried
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; because he was made sin.
[1:50:52] When he was bitten, it was sin that was
[1:50:54] being bitten.
[1:50:56] When he was mocked, it was sin that was
[1:50:58] being mocked. When he was stripped
[1:51:00] naked, it was sin that was being
[1:51:02] stripped naked. Amen. And that sin was
[1:51:06] buried for eternity.
[1:51:10] Hallelujah.
[1:51:11] Amen.
[1:51:13] I just like to end up with this quote.
[1:51:24] Why can't why some people can't keep the
[1:51:27] victory
[1:51:34] and I think today brother
[1:51:37] when he taken one thing
[1:51:40] not an intellectual being but it taken
[1:51:43] the love of God to send Christ to the
[1:51:47] cross to die there in disgrace and
[1:51:52] shame.
[1:51:55] And you mean to tell me that the
[1:51:57] Pentecostal church or any other church
[1:52:01] will turn down the real love of God?
[1:52:05] I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:52:08] Christ is the power of God to salvation.
[1:52:14] If you'd rather say
[1:52:17] holy roller, let us act like that as
[1:52:20] long as the as the love of God's down in
[1:52:24] my heart. Certainly doesn't matter. Oh
[1:52:28] brother, God gave the Holy Spirit,
[1:52:33] God's love to control the church.
[1:52:36] Not smart, educated, but love.
[1:52:42] Gifts goes in the church but it don't
[1:52:47] control the church.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Love controls the church.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world he gave his only
[1:52:58] begotten son his love constrained
[1:53:02] him to do it.
[1:53:05] And when love is constrained, then
[1:53:08] sovereign grace projects its object.
[1:53:13] May I say that again? When divine love
[1:53:16] is projected, grace produces its object.
[1:53:21] When God loved the world so much, till
[1:53:25] sovereign grace projected a savior to
[1:53:29] the world. Yes indeed. And when you love
[1:53:33] God so much, sovereign grace will
[1:53:37] project to you the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:40] Ghost to make you love and love and to
[1:53:45] be a real Christian.
[1:53:50] When the love of God is expressed,
[1:53:54] amen, you forgive, you don't condemn.
[1:53:58] Amen.
[1:54:00] You still have hope for everyone.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't shut the door. Amen. The
[1:54:06] door is still open.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. As much as God had mercy upon you,
[1:54:11] he still can have mercy upon that one.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; It's not our job to write off some
[1:54:20] people. No. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] May the good Lord bless you.
[1:54:35] Just like to end up with this song,
[1:54:37] brother Isaac can just sing the love of
[1:54:39] God.
[1:55:26] Good day.

[2:00:21] the saints say
[2:00:26] Jerus.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. I really appreciate
[2:00:34] that.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; You enjoy that. Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Just going to
[2:00:38] read a couple of scriptures. Thank you,
[2:00:40] musicians. And um sorry, I don't have
[2:00:43] any slides tonight. Um, but we're just
[2:00:45] going to go to Psalms 124 and we're
[2:00:48] going to read verses 1 to
[2:00:51] 8 and then we're going to go read read
[2:00:53] from 2 Timothy 2 and 13. So, let's let's
[2:00:56] just turn to Psalms 124 and verses 1
[2:00:59] to8.
[2:01:01] It's been it's it has been maybe we'll
[2:01:04] just read this.
[2:01:05] I'll begin. But
[2:01:08] it's good to see everyone here tonight.
[2:01:12] Amen. See everyone? Is everyone there?
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalms 124:1-8, the song of
[2:01:18] degrees of David. If had if it had had
[2:01:21] not been the Lord who was on our side,
[2:01:24] now may Israel say, if it had not been
[2:01:27] the Lord who was on our side when men
[2:01:29] rose up against us, then then they had
[2:01:33] swallowed us up quick when their wrath
[2:01:35] was kindled against us. Then the waters
[2:01:38] had overwhelmed us. The stream had gone
[2:01:40] over our soul. Then the proud waters had
[2:01:43] gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord
[2:01:46] who hath not given us as a prey to their
[2:01:49] teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out
[2:01:51] of the snare of the fowlers. The snare
[2:01:54] is broken and we are escaped. Our help
[2:01:57] is in the name of the Lord who hath made
[2:02:00] heaven and earth.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Then we go to second
[2:02:03] Timothy uh 2 and13.
[2:02:08] And um I just want to yeah just just
[2:02:10] read this here. It says um so 2 Timothy
[2:02:13] 2:13
[2:02:16] and it says here if we believe not yet
[2:02:20] he abideth faithful he cannot deny
[2:02:23] himself. Now this is in the uh I think
[2:02:25] the Young's literal translation says if
[2:02:28] we are not steadfast he remainth
[2:02:30] steadfast to deny himself he is not
[2:02:33] able. That's right.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow heads in a word of
[2:02:36] prayer tonight. Thank you Lord. We so
[2:02:39] appreciate your great divine love.
[2:02:41] Hallelujah. We just want to bow our
[2:02:43] heads with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[2:02:44] Just want to ask Lord as we've read your
[2:02:46] word once again. We pray you'd anoint
[2:02:48] both speaker and hear. We thank you for
[2:02:50] this evening we could have. We love you
[2:02:51] so much. Just pray you'd uh just
[2:02:53] continue to be with us during this
[2:02:55] service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:02:58] Amen. God bless you friends. You can
[2:02:59] have your seats tonight. So uh this year
[2:03:02] is has has been quite a year and I think
[2:03:05] it's been a theme you know through the
[2:03:07] songs the testimonies of of God has
[2:03:10] remained faithful
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; in every circumstance and I can say that
[2:03:15] this year it has actually been the best
[2:03:17] year like I it's to me it's not a cliche
[2:03:19] I'm sure we say it every year we
[2:03:20] probably do it because really you know
[2:03:22] but but this year has literally been the
[2:03:25] best year in a long time
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; we've been through a lot of things you
[2:03:29] know we know We've been through a lot of
[2:03:31] things, but I'm so thankful I'm not the
[2:03:33] person I was this time a year ago. I'm
[2:03:36] so thankful I'm not that guy. The Lord
[2:03:39] had to do a big thing to shake me and
[2:03:41] wake me up. I was drifting along half
[2:03:44] asleep, but God had to shake me. I
[2:03:47] remember before Christine had the
[2:03:48] accident there in June, I dropped her
[2:03:50] off at at at her work and I was driving
[2:03:52] out the gate there at the hospital and I
[2:03:55] was praying and then something came
[2:03:56] over. I said, "Lord," and and I just
[2:03:58] came out of my lips. "Lord, make me more
[2:03:59] sincere." I thought, "Where did that
[2:04:01] come from?" You know, this wasn't
[2:04:02] something I was bothered by, but it just
[2:04:05] came out. Then couple of days later, she
[2:04:07] was rearended on the motorway and we
[2:04:09] know the rest of the story. But I'm so
[2:04:11] thankful in this whole thing, I can
[2:04:13] literally say the Lord has carried us
[2:04:15] through.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; We've been carried like as sister
[2:04:18] Tabitha was felt led to read that poem.
[2:04:21] We can look back on 2026 and say, "I can
[2:04:23] see one set of footprints. It's not my
[2:04:25] footprints. is his footprints. I mean,
[2:04:27] as he has carried us through and you
[2:04:29] know, it it it's been phenomenal to see
[2:04:32] God, you know, like when Christine was
[2:04:34] hit by the car, you know, the Lord just
[2:04:36] dropped in her heart. Romans 8:28. And
[2:04:38] we know all things work together for the
[2:04:40] good
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; of those that love God and called
[2:04:43] according to his purpose. And that's all
[2:04:45] things, not the things you like, not the
[2:04:48] things that are agreeable to you, but
[2:04:50] all things work together for your good.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this accident has been a
[2:04:54] blessing.
[2:04:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; It's been a tremendous year. God has
[2:04:58] done incredible things and he has always
[2:05:01] remained faithful. I think it's one
[2:05:03] thing we can look back and we can we can
[2:05:05] we can realize he is the unfailing
[2:05:08] faithful God.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we want to quit, we want to
[2:05:12] give up, we want to just shell up, he's
[2:05:14] like, "No, I'm not going to let you do
[2:05:15] that. I'm going to shake you until you
[2:05:17] get out of your cage cuz I want you to
[2:05:18] fly with me. I want to prove in you what
[2:05:22] you have in you already. I want to prove
[2:05:24] it. But I'm going to bring you through
[2:05:25] many things, deep waters, trouble,
[2:05:27] trials, testing. But I'm going to show
[2:05:29] you, you are one in a million.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; You're worth more than 10,000 worlds.
[2:05:33] You're very valuable. You're the apple
[2:05:35] of my eye. And you know, and and God has
[2:05:37] God has always remained faithful. So I
[2:05:40] thank God for this year. I thank God for
[2:05:42] all of you and those who are not here,
[2:05:44] but you know, you know, who are who are
[2:05:45] traveling. But I thank God for what a
[2:05:47] wonderful body
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; it's been. It's been so amazing just to
[2:05:51] see everyone rally and and be a help and
[2:05:54] be a blessing and I mean as you all are
[2:05:56] anyway but it's just been wonderful to
[2:05:59] be part of it's been wonderful to see
[2:06:02] you know sadly this year is a you know
[2:06:04] been a year of shaking you know sadly we
[2:06:06] had the sturs leave and the enquiners
[2:06:08] have gone they've gone to uh you know to
[2:06:11] Perth and you know the strokes have gone
[2:06:12] up north and and and that was quite a
[2:06:14] shock right quite a loss
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; amen okay but some of us agree
[2:06:20] I'll speak for everyone, but you know,
[2:06:21] but God had to do that cuz I think we
[2:06:23] got comfortable. Maybe I just speak to
[2:06:25] myself. I got comfortable. So God had to
[2:06:28] allow gifts to move for other gifts to
[2:06:30] take their place, you know. So I'm so
[2:06:33] thankful for brother Ed who's taken over
[2:06:34] the Sunday school. So thankful for for
[2:06:37] fish here who's taken over the youth
[2:06:39] group and of course, brother Jimmy has
[2:06:41] taken over the prayer meetings on the
[2:06:42] Monday night there with the youth. So
[2:06:43] I'm so glad these ones have all stepped
[2:06:45] up and you know, and then many others
[2:06:47] see the band. You know, I just enjoy it.
[2:06:48] You know, you know, I sit in my lounge
[2:06:51] and what you see here, I just see at
[2:06:52] home. I don't have to come here to see
[2:06:54] it. I just see it at home. The girls
[2:06:55] start singing and playing and I just
[2:06:57] enjoy it.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; I feel blessed,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; you know. Then then other youth come and
[2:07:01] start jamming and you know, it's neat.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; It's neat to see gifts evolve and and
[2:07:06] God moving people into different
[2:07:08] positions and you know, but this year
[2:07:10] has been a year. So if I'm rambling,
[2:07:12] well, you know, it's been a year. I can
[2:07:14] ramble a bit, I feel. But we've been
[2:07:16] through a lot.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; But we can look back and we can say, I'm
[2:07:21] not that person.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; I'm a better Christian.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; I'm a bit, you know, God is God has done
[2:07:26] a work. And and many times it's the fire
[2:07:28] and the hardship God uses to bring out
[2:07:30] the best. You know, you take a diamond.
[2:07:33] It's been in the heart of the earth
[2:07:34] under intense pressure, but it becomes a
[2:07:37] precious jewel. It's carbon like coal
[2:07:39] is, but it's been forced under great
[2:07:41] pressure. It's been molded into the
[2:07:43] hardest substance, I think, known to
[2:07:45] man. I think, you know, and but but now
[2:07:47] it's a very precious jewel. And men go
[2:07:50] digging deep under the earth to find
[2:07:52] these things that have been molded. And
[2:07:54] God has done that in our lives. He's
[2:07:56] taken us. He's put us under great
[2:07:58] pressure because he knows what we're
[2:07:59] made of. And he wants us now to come,
[2:08:01] not be buried, those gifts to be buried
[2:08:03] under the earth, this humanity, but to
[2:08:05] come forth into the sunlight. But first,
[2:08:07] it's got to be cut by the word.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; And then and then now what does he do?
[2:08:12] He can now reflect his his deity through
[2:08:15] us. Put us in his crown. Amen. And we
[2:08:18] are his precious jewels by his supreme
[2:08:20] grace.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's been it's been a great
[2:08:24] year. And I've just been thinking a bit
[2:08:25] about, you know, how
[2:08:28] uh in the Old Testament, they would they
[2:08:30] would have a yearly season of feasts.
[2:08:32] You know, you read it in I think
[2:08:33] Leviticus 23:24, the seven feasts over
[2:08:36] the year. And you know, and you know,
[2:08:38] every year they'd come and and you know,
[2:08:39] they would, for example, they'd have the
[2:08:41] feast of the Passover. And so we're
[2:08:43] going to have the Lord's table tonight,
[2:08:45] you know, which is the, you know, the
[2:08:46] Passover was pointing to, you know,
[2:08:48] Calvary and its great sacrifice and the
[2:08:50] Lord and, you know, how we become one
[2:08:52] with our sacrifice. But every year they
[2:08:53] would come back and they'd have this
[2:08:54] feast. And I believe I believe it wasn't
[2:08:57] just to have a perpetual, oh, this is
[2:09:00] what we do every year. But I believe
[2:09:02] that God puts these things in time that
[2:09:04] becomes a landmark that we'd come back.
[2:09:07] So, so we've come back to another New
[2:09:08] Year's Eve and we can look back now back
[2:09:11] at a year of what God has done
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; and we can say God has taken us higher.
[2:09:16] You know, you know what we read there in
[2:09:17] Psalms, a song of degrees that that
[2:09:19] actually means a song of ascension. We
[2:09:22] have ascended you know from through 2025
[2:09:24] God has taken us higher in him. The word
[2:09:27] has become more real, become more
[2:09:29] personal, become more alive. I mean, God
[2:09:32] has become more, you know, his
[2:09:34] faithfulness has become more real to us.
[2:09:36] You know, he's he's revealed himself in
[2:09:38] a more personal way. This is just my
[2:09:39] experience, you know, where where where
[2:09:41] I've come to a point in my life where
[2:09:43] there's nothing to fear, where God is
[2:09:45] more than able. He he's he's he's power
[2:09:47] he's the all powerful almighty God. And,
[2:09:49] you know, he's he's made it so concrete
[2:09:51] that we are his children. And it's his
[2:09:53] grace that sustains us, keeps us, guides
[2:09:55] us, and leads us. And we have nothing to
[2:09:57] fear in this world. No weapon of hell,
[2:10:00] no scheme of man. Nothing can pluck us
[2:10:02] out of his hand. I pray that's more than
[2:10:05] a song, but it's a reality to us now. As
[2:10:07] we look back in this year, we say, "God,
[2:10:09] you've been faithful." When I have not
[2:10:11] been faithful, yet he has a birth. He
[2:10:13] has stayed faithful because he is
[2:10:15] faithful and true. It's what he is.
[2:10:17] Amen. And he cannot deviate from that
[2:10:19] because that is what he is. Amen. And
[2:10:21] and so we can look back and say, "Thank
[2:10:23] you, Lord.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; You are the faithful one.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; You're the one holding us. You're the
[2:10:28] one that's kept us. You're the one who's
[2:10:30] delivered us. We cry out to you and in
[2:10:32] your great grace, you've answered our
[2:10:33] prayers. You've been mindful of us.
[2:10:35] You've remembered us in this dark chaos
[2:10:38] and you've kept us." Amen. And so I
[2:10:40] think we can we can look back as they
[2:10:42] would have a feast. You the feast every
[2:10:43] year. And you know, they could look back
[2:10:46] and say, "God, you've been faithful."
[2:10:47] And we can look back and say, "God,
[2:10:49] you've been faithful and true." And I
[2:10:51] was thinking about Enoch because Enoch
[2:10:53] is a type of us and he was, you know, he
[2:10:55] was a shadow. We're the reality. And you
[2:10:57] know, Enoch walked with God.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; He walked with God for 300 years. I was
[2:11:02] saying, "What a blessing that would be
[2:11:05] to have 300 years to walk with God."
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; You know, naturally, we will never have
[2:11:10] that because our lifespan isn't that
[2:11:12] long. Naturally speaking, we're going to
[2:11:14] walk with him for eternity. So, it's
[2:11:16] okay. But you see, but he was so blessed
[2:11:18] for 300 years. I got to walk with you,
[2:11:21] Lord. And I walked all the way home with
[2:11:23] him.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've had a blessed 365 more
[2:11:29] days
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; walking with God.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Him proving his word. You think about
[2:11:33] sitting there like Enoch and you know
[2:11:35] maybe maybe the day before his
[2:11:37] translation he'd look back and say Lord
[2:11:39] I've had no I don't have the maths but
[2:11:41] you could break it down how many hours
[2:11:43] 300 years is and how many days and how
[2:11:46] many seconds and but but but he would
[2:11:48] probably look back and say Lord you have
[2:11:50] proven your word. You've proven your
[2:11:52] faithfulness, your integrity, your
[2:11:54] strength, your power, your deliverance,
[2:11:56] your guidance for 300 years.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can look back and say,
[2:12:02] "Lord,
[2:12:04] maybe you became a Christian this year.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Maybe you've been a
[2:12:08] believer many years, but you can look
[2:12:11] back and say, Lord, all my life, you
[2:12:13] have been faithful. You have been true.
[2:12:16] I have not been leading myself, Lord.
[2:12:18] You've been leading me on this path.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; You found me. You interrupted my
[2:12:22] program. You revealed yourself to me.
[2:12:25] And now, Lord, I've had another blessed
[2:12:27] year walking with you."
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. through valleys, through fires,
[2:12:31] through trials, on mountains, every
[2:12:34] through every kind of thing.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; But God's been good.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; God has proven himself in every single
[2:12:41] situation.
[2:12:44] So, we can look back at this year and
[2:12:46] say, "Thank you, Lord. You have abided
[2:12:49] faithful. You've remained steadfast when
[2:12:52] we have not been steadfast because you
[2:12:55] cannot deny who you are."
[2:12:59] And so I think as we as we now kind of
[2:13:01] change the service and we and we
[2:13:02] approach the Lord's table, um if we
[2:13:05] don't foot washing before midnight, I
[2:13:07] think that's okay. Don't you think we
[2:13:08] can just maybe take the communion then
[2:13:10] pray in the new year then go our ways,
[2:13:12] you know? I think that's okay. Don't you
[2:13:13] think? Is that okay? Cuz I want it
[2:13:15] because this year
[2:13:18] we may not be here in a year,
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; right? We might we might be in glory.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's okay,
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; you know? So I think why don't we as we
[2:13:31] prepare ourselves as we you know we're
[2:13:32] going to read 1 Corinthians 11 you know
[2:13:35] but why don't we just prepare our hearts
[2:13:36] say Lord you've brought me thus far
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; you will not fail me
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; you haven't brought me this far to lose
[2:13:45] me you haven't brought me this far to
[2:13:48] let me wander off but you've saved me to
[2:13:50] keep me right
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and you're more than able and I tell you
[2:13:54] what friends we are ascending
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; every day we're going higher with the
[2:13:58] Lord. You know that's why you know many
[2:14:00] things we as we you know the opening
[2:14:02] scripture was he has broken our soul has
[2:14:07] escaped as the bird out of the snare of
[2:14:09] the fowlers the snare is broken and we
[2:14:12] are escaped.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; God has broken snares
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; in our lives. Snares of fear complexes
[2:14:20] anxiety worry doubt unbelief
[2:14:23] superstition. They've been broken
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; family complexes, worries about are you
[2:14:29] really powerful enough God to give the
[2:14:31] victory. He's proven it.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; All of hell could be against you. You
[2:14:35] can stand there victorious against that
[2:14:37] thing. Because if God before you, who
[2:14:39] can be against you?
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing. You will walk out packing the
[2:14:44] victory.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Right? So we can we can we can say truly
[2:14:49] we have escaped.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; We haven't we haven't partially escaped.
[2:14:53] We are completely free. Who the sun is
[2:14:55] set free is free indeed.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; So we can we can approach 2026
[2:15:02] and say thank you Lord.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; You are the faithful one.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; And you'll be faithful tomorrow and the
[2:15:09] next day and you will always be faithful
[2:15:12] and we can trust you like never before
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; because your word is true. This message
[2:15:18] works.
[2:15:20] Amen. There is untapped resources,
[2:15:23] untapped power in God that I believe in
[2:15:25] 2026, God's going to open his word
[2:15:29] and do incredible things.
[2:15:32] We haven't plateaued. We're not called
[2:15:33] to plateau. We're calling we're called
[2:15:35] to ascend. This message is an un
[2:15:37] unfolding of the mighty God, the
[2:15:39] unveiling of the mighty God, right, in
[2:15:42] our lives. So, what are we going to do?
[2:15:44] We're going to keep going up. Are there
[2:15:46] going to be trials? Yes. Is there going
[2:15:48] to be hardship? Yes. Valleys? Yes.
[2:15:51] Unexpected things happening. Yes. But in
[2:15:54] all those things, God will be with you
[2:15:57] and
[2:15:59] Amen.
[2:16:01] I remember standing there in Wellington
[2:16:04] airport. This is just after Christine
[2:16:06] had the accident. Remember I went to
[2:16:08] brother Daniel White's youth camp and
[2:16:09] there I am standing there Noel and I was
[2:16:12] traveling well I was traveling near
[2:16:14] Anelise and Noel because they didn't
[2:16:16] want me to sit with them in the
[2:16:17] airplane. That's a whole another story
[2:16:18] anyway. But but I'm there and I and and
[2:16:21] and I'm unbelievably conflicted.
[2:16:24] Unbelievably. There's my wife. Just had
[2:16:27] this accident.
[2:16:29] Can't speak really. Concussed, severely
[2:16:33] severe whiplash at home. Her sister and
[2:16:36] mom's come down to look after all the,
[2:16:38] you know, everyone's rallying all these
[2:16:39] things. But here I am. I'm about to get
[2:16:41] on a plane to go to another country and
[2:16:44] to preach a youth camp. I'm thinking,
[2:16:45] what am I doing?
[2:16:48] what am I doing? She's like, you have to
[2:16:50] go. So, happy wife, happy life. Okay,
[2:16:56] but that's the kind of person she is. Go
[2:16:58] do what the Lord has called you to do.
[2:16:59] I'm there at the um there at the
[2:17:01] departure lounge,
[2:17:04] uh walking up and down, pacing,
[2:17:05] thinking, Lord, what am I doing? I
[2:17:08] should stay and I should quit. Maybe
[2:17:09] I'll just try my mind. I'll just get
[2:17:11] them to go on the plane because they can
[2:17:13] get there and I'll stay home. And then
[2:17:15] the Lord's just dropping scripture in
[2:17:17] and scripture, you know, cuz I'm
[2:17:19] preaching there at the youth camp. And
[2:17:21] I'm like, well, I'm go. I guess I'm
[2:17:23] going. And no, but it was, you'd have to
[2:17:28] be in that situation to understand.
[2:17:30] You're so conflicted. I'm sure all
[2:17:32] husbands would understand. What are you
[2:17:34] doing naturally? You should not be
[2:17:36] leaving the country while this is going
[2:17:38] on. But God is just dropping in
[2:17:39] scripture and quickening things and
[2:17:42] things for me to preach. And you know,
[2:17:44] young people were set free over there.
[2:17:46] God did great things. But he was God was
[2:17:49] faithful.
[2:17:51] You all rallied, looked after her. I was
[2:17:54] there. God took care of it all. We came
[2:17:56] home. You know, all these things. But
[2:17:58] even in great distress and trials and
[2:18:00] questions, God is faithful.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm get to there. Amen. So,
[2:18:05] let's um let's just all turn to 1
[2:18:07] Corinthians uh 11 and um
[2:18:12] Let's just read here because as we come
[2:18:15] forward and take of the Lord's table,
[2:18:17] you are you're making a public
[2:18:20] declaration that you and your sacrifice
[2:18:23] have become one. Like in the very very
[2:18:26] first Passover there in Egypt, they took
[2:18:29] the lamb, they killed the lamb, they
[2:18:31] roasted the lamb with bitter herbs, and
[2:18:34] they ate the lamb.
[2:18:36] So before that was all and
[2:18:40] before that all happened, there was the
[2:18:42] family and there was the lamb. They're
[2:18:44] two separate things. But then after that
[2:18:46] was all said and done, all you saw was
[2:18:47] the family walk out under the blood
[2:18:51] because they became one with their
[2:18:52] sacrifice.
[2:18:54] And as we read this, as we approach the
[2:18:57] Lord's table, you're you're you're
[2:18:58] telling the world,
[2:19:01] I've become one with the Lord Jesus
[2:19:02] Christ. So, I'm walking by his power,
[2:19:06] his anointing, by his word. It's no
[2:19:09] longer I that liveth, but it's my
[2:19:11] sacrifice in me. If I could put it's
[2:19:13] it's Christ in me, the hope of glory.
[2:19:17] Amen. So, we're just going to read from
[2:19:18] um verse uh 23 in 1 Corinthians 11
[2:19:25] because this is a sacred night. I
[2:19:28] believe you this out.
[2:19:36] We may never have another New Year's
[2:19:38] Eve.
[2:19:40] Let's prepare our hearts like never
[2:19:41] before
[2:19:43] for whatever. Remember, the Lord knows
[2:19:45] 2026.
[2:19:47] But may we walk with grace and assurance
[2:19:51] that whatever happens,
[2:19:54] God is in control of all things.
[2:20:00] For I have received of the Lord that
[2:20:01] which also I delivered unto you. That
[2:20:04] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[2:20:06] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[2:20:08] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[2:20:10] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[2:20:12] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[2:20:15] of me." After the same manner also he
[2:20:18] took the cup, when he had sucked,
[2:20:20] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[2:20:22] in my blood. This do ye as oft as you
[2:20:25] drink it in remembrance of me. For as
[2:20:27] often as you eat this bread and drink
[2:20:30] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[2:20:32] till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall
[2:20:35] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[2:20:37] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[2:20:40] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[2:20:43] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[2:20:45] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[2:20:47] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[2:20:50] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[2:20:51] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[2:20:54] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:20:56] among you and many sleep. For if we
[2:20:59] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[2:21:01] judged. And but when we are judged, we
[2:21:04] are chastened of the Lord that we uh
[2:21:07] that we should not be condemned with the
[2:21:09] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[2:21:12] come together to eat, tarry one for
[2:21:13] another, and if any man hunger, let him
[2:21:16] eat at home, that ye come not together
[2:21:18] under condemnation, and the rest will I
[2:21:20] set in order when I come.
[2:21:23] So we need to examine our lives before
[2:21:25] we partake of. We know this is symbolic.
[2:21:28] The wine is symbolic of his blood. The
[2:21:30] unleven bread is symbolic of his body.
[2:21:33] But we need to examine our lives. Lord,
[2:21:35] is my life under the blood? Are there
[2:21:37] any sins I need to confess and make
[2:21:39] right? Those things are important before
[2:21:41] you come and partake because you're
[2:21:43] showing the world that you have become
[2:21:45] one with your sacrifice. Now I just want
[2:21:48] to read I just want to I just want to
[2:21:50] read a quote from uh it's from
[2:21:52] remembering the Lord
[2:21:55] and he says this this is the end of the
[2:21:57] sermon or near the end he says he says
[2:22:00] we remember the blessings that you have
[2:22:02] been to us and re we remember your word
[2:22:06] that you would never leave us nor
[2:22:07] forsake us old age will have nothing to
[2:22:10] do it you'll still remember us when the
[2:22:13] world shall be no more and time shall
[2:22:15] fade into eternity
[2:22:16] It is written something like this. Could
[2:22:18] a mother forget her suckling babe? I can
[2:22:21] never forget you. You've you're you're
[2:22:23] engraved upon the palms of my hands the
[2:22:26] nails that engraved our names. We know
[2:22:29] that you remember us, Lord. And may you
[2:22:32] always be in our fondest memories as our
[2:22:35] savior, our healer, our king, our lover,
[2:22:37] our life, our sunshine, our all and all.
[2:22:41] That's that inexhaustible fountain of
[2:22:43] God's grace and love to we fallen human
[2:22:46] beings of God of Adam's family. Grant
[2:22:49] it, Lord, as we commit ourselves to thee
[2:22:51] now, going from the tabernacle tonight,
[2:22:53] remembering Jesus. Amen. I thought that
[2:22:57] so blessed me how it says that we know
[2:22:59] you remember us, Lord.
[2:23:03] See, because he says, "Do these things
[2:23:04] in remembrance of me." But the Lord
[2:23:06] remembers us.
[2:23:08] We He doesn't forget us.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; We're on his mind constantly, on his
[2:23:12] heart, constantly.
[2:23:15] He cares very much what you're going
[2:23:18] through. So, never think you're out of
