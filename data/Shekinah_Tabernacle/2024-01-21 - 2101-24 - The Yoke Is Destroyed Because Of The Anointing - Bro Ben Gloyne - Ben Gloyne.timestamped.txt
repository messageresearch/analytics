[24:03] other ideas amen and brother Braham says
[24:06] you know the devil can't take you until
[24:08] your purpose is done so you both
[24:11] Gabriel's got a purpose Maggie's got a
[24:12] purpose Ben you've got a purpose Amen to
[24:14] express the Lord amen so we're here to
[24:17] dedicate Gabriel Jesse Bailey to the
[24:19] Lord Jesus Christ you know as we know on
[24:21] the scripture there's no record of
[24:23] infant baptism or anything like that
[24:25] they just brought their little ones to
[24:26] the Lord Jesus and and he and he blessed
[24:29] them so that's what we want to do amen
[24:31] this morning and um I love he's got a
[24:34] powerful name you've given a real
[24:36] powerful name amen Gabriel means a so
[24:39] it's a compound uh word and it's it
[24:41] means a valiant man or Warrior and the
[24:44] strength of the almighty my amen I pray
[24:48] he lives out all these names it's very
[24:49] powerful amen and and when I I was
[24:52] looking at this um the scripture came to
[24:54] mind from Daniel chapter 8 where Daniel
[24:57] said and it came to pass when I even I
[24:59] Daniel had seen the vision and sought
[25:01] for the meaning then behold they stood
[25:03] before me as the appearance of a man and
[25:06] I heard a man's voice between the banks
[25:08] of U which said uh which called and said
[25:12] Gabriel make this man to understand the
[25:14] vision and I pray that Gabriel as he
[25:16] grows older that people would see him
[25:18] because many people won't read a Bible
[25:20] but they'll read our lives so I pray
[25:22] when he when he gets older you know
[25:24] he'll be such a testimony I believe he's
[25:26] already been a testimony amen that that
[25:28] people would understand the Bible and
[25:30] understand the mercy of God and His
[25:32] grace and his love through his life amen
[25:34] so his life will cause people to
[25:36] understand the vision of the word and we
[25:38] know Jesse it means God's gift or the
[25:40] Lord exists or King so I pray he is
[25:43] God's gift to you amen I think the
[25:46] doctor said you couldn't even have
[25:47] babies eh well here we are amen here he
[25:49] is amen so he's truly God's gift and I
[25:52] pray his life would just shout out the
[25:54] Lord exists he's alive you can meet him
[25:56] he's the same yesterday today forever
[25:59] and Bailey I thought is a very special
[26:00] name the surname Bailey is English in
[26:03] origin it's coming from the anglio
[26:05] French word which means a baia or to
[26:09] deliver Bailey is an occupational
[26:11] surname used most prevalently as a
[26:14] description of a BFF or a steward less
[26:17] less often Bailey sometimes could also
[26:20] be attached to those who live near a
[26:21] castle or a stronghold and a Bailey used
[26:24] to be an oldfashioned Castle there a
[26:25] mountain Bailey it's called so I pray he
[26:28] would he would live out that he would
[26:29] deliver amen the Lord through him would
[26:31] deliver many souls to the kingdom of God
[26:34] and it's an occupational Sur name so I
[26:36] pray that it wouldn't be it would be an
[26:37] OCC it would be a way of life for him
[26:40] Amen to to manifest the Lord Jesus
[26:43] Christ amen as he grows and as he gets
[26:45] older amen so can I can I hold him amen
[26:48] sleeping like an angel
[26:51] amen amen hallelujah let's bow our head
[26:54] shall we gracious father Lord we hold
[26:57] your gift here Lord Jesus little Gabriel

[38:48] day amen so let's just uh take the
[38:50] scripture this morning and we're going
[38:52] to go to um Isaiah 10 and verse 27 then
[38:58] we're going to so I don't have a
[38:59] slideshow today so it's kind of an
[39:01] oldfashioned
[39:02] time um and then we're going to go to
[39:04] Ezekiel chapter 28 it was nice here with
[39:06] uh Isaiah 27 because I was looking how
[39:09] to um tie the uh sermon all together I'd
[39:13] been uh just preparing during the week
[39:15] and then after that tremendous
[39:16] outpouring we had on Wednesday night I
[39:18] know it's not on the recording but at
[39:20] the end after prayer and amen you know
[39:22] um um the Lord spoke to Christine's
[39:24] heart this scripture and I thought this
[39:25] just you'll see B tied together so
[39:27] Isaiah 20 10 and verse
[39:29] 27 um says here and it shall come to
[39:33] pass in that day that his burden shall
[39:35] be taken from off thy shoulder and his
[39:38] yoke off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
[39:41] destroyed because of the anointing amen
[39:44] so it's the anointing that breaks the
[39:46] Yoke of the enemy amen and then we're
[39:49] going to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 we're
[39:51] going to read verses
[39:53] 12-6 so we're just going to talk about
[39:55] this um
[39:57] the breaking of the Yoke by the
[39:59] anointing first we're going to talk
[40:01] about the the the Yoke and how the Devil
[40:04] comes in we got to study our opponent
[40:07] amen we're in a we're in a battle right
[40:09] so Ezekiel
[40:11] 28:12 says here son of man take up a
[40:13] lamentation upon upon the king of Tyrus
[40:16] and say unto him thus sayith the Lord
[40:18] God thou Sealth up the Su full of wisdom
[40:21] and perfect and Beauty thou H has been
[40:23] an Eden the Garden of God every precious

[40:27] topaz the diamond the barrel the ANS The
[40:30] Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the
[40:32] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[40:34] thy tabrets and of thy pipes was
[40:36] prepared in thee in the day that thou
[40:38] was created Thou Art the anointed cherub
[40:41] that coverthe set thee so thou was upon
[40:45] the holy mountain of God and thou Hast
[40:47] walked up and down in the midst of the
[40:48] stones of fire thou was perfect in thy
[40:51] ways from the day that thou was created
[40:54] until iniquity was found in the yeah by
[40:57] the multitude of thy merchandise they
[40:59] have filled the um midst of thee with
[41:01] violence and thou Hast sinned therefore
[41:04] I will cast thee as profane out of the
[41:06] Mountain of God and I'll destroy thee Oh
[41:08] covering cherub from the midst of the
[41:10] stones of fire amen we're just going to
[41:12] finish reading there this is talking we
[41:14] know he's talking about the anointing on
[41:17] on the king of tyus here so let's just
[41:18] bow heads in a word of prayer you want
[41:20] to be remembered in pray you want to
[41:21] slip up your hand to the Lord just defy
[41:23] gravity this morning say Lord I have a

[42:18] watching in the name of Jesus Christ we
[42:20] ask these things amen amen God bless you
[42:23] friends you can have your seats this
[42:24] morning so I want to I want to talk
[42:26] about this this uh enemy we face and how
[42:29] he can be broken because we understand
[42:32] that we're in a Warfare as as the Bible
[42:34] would tell us that the enemy uh that
[42:37] that that we have to take on the full
[42:39] armor of God that we may be able to
[42:41] stand in the evil day and then we have
[42:44] to put on the whole armor of God that we
[42:45] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[42:47] the devil that's Ephesians 6:11 now this
[42:50] WS in the in the Greek it means his
[42:53] methods he is a method of of of warfare
[42:56] he he doesn't come haphazardly he comes
[42:58] in very calculated Manner and we need to
[43:00] know how he fights in order to overcome
[43:03] his his Warfare
[43:05] now um we understand that in any any
[43:09] Warfare or or any sport you know you
[43:12] fight according to the equipment you
[43:14] have your tactics are based around your
[43:16] weapons that's right you look at any
[43:19] kind of warfare that's been through
[43:20] history the tactics that they formed
[43:22] were based on the weapons that they had
[43:23] at the time and even this latest war in
[43:25] the Ukraine they fight differently now
[43:28] than how they fought in the past because
[43:30] of electronic warfare drone Warfare
[43:32] there's different Hypersonic missiles
[43:33] there's different kind of tactics they
[43:34] use on the battlefield even though it
[43:36] may look kind of similar there they got
[43:38] trenches they've got bunkers they got
[43:39] all kinds of things like that but it's
[43:41] but it's been modified because of the
[43:43] weapons right and it's the same thing on
[43:45] the sports field if you're selecting a
[43:47] team and just say you got a football
[43:48] team and and and you've got the best
[43:50] striker in the world he's fast he's
[43:53] agile he's very good with the ball he
[43:55] can just s you know he can he can beat
[43:57] any keeper you're not going to put that
[43:59] guy in defense you're not going to put
[44:01] him as a keeper you're not going to put
[44:02] him in defense because he's built to be
[44:04] a striker okay you are not going to put
[44:07] a a a jet fighter pilot as a as a
[44:10] private infantry soldier in a trench cuz
[44:13] he's trained to be a jet fighter pilot
[44:15] he's built to be a jet figh fighter
[44:16] pilot right so so the devil was built a
[44:19] certain way in heaven and he did not
[44:21] change his ways when he failed you know
[44:23] we know that devils are Fallen Angels
[44:25] they are not something different they
[44:27] were once angels in the presence of God
[44:29] doing what God built them to do but then
[44:31] as we read about the devil there
[44:33] iniquity was found in his heart he
[44:34] thought he was something special above
[44:36] what God made him to be and then he
[44:38] thought he had a better idea than what
[44:39] God made him to be and then so iniquity
[44:41] was formed in his heart and then he fell
[44:43] but he was originally the anointed
[44:45] cherub that
[44:47] coverthe up here but if you just have in
[44:49] your mind the picture of the tab um the
[44:51] you know the Ark of the Covenant how
[44:52] there's the two cherums Above The Mercy
[44:54] Seat they are guard or covering that
[44:57] mercy seat so a so a cherub actually
[45:00] guards the way to the presence of God
[45:02] this is this is what the devil was made
[45:04] to be now he will come down now because
[45:07] because he does not want us to get into
[45:09] the presence of God he will try and
[45:11] influence us away from the presence of
[45:13] God or he'll try and influence us to
[45:15] believe a lie and be damned by it see
[45:17] this is his this is his method you see
[45:20] you could say before he fell he was a
[45:22] striker he's still a striker today right
[45:25] he's not a defensive player he's a
[45:26] striker okay so so you just like he's a
[45:29] jet fighter pilot before he fell he's
[45:31] still a jet fighter pilot but now he's
[45:32] in a perverted way so he was the
[45:34] anointed Cher that cover he doesn't
[45:36] guard the way to God anymore in that way
[45:38] he's been kicked out of heaven right but
[45:40] he'll still try and function in that way
[45:42] cuz that's how he was made now praise
[45:46] the Lord so everyone following me so far
[45:48] amen so you know we got to we got to
[45:49] know how to fight this enemy we got to
[45:51] we got to know how to withstand his
[45:54] attacks you see he he can you know if he
[45:58] can he will he will try and knock us out
[46:01] see brother Braham says this here he
[46:02] says now we have to see it's like
[46:04] training so like we're in a contest like
[46:06] a boxer okay you're going to have to
[46:08] meet an opponent now any any sports team
[46:10] or any coach that's worth his salt as a
[46:12] coach or a manager will study the team
[46:14] they're about to play you know you look
[46:16] at any any professional Sportsman they
[46:19] don't just sit around and say I'm going
[46:20] to turn up to the game and I'm going to
[46:21] play against this team or whatever more
[46:23] any manager they are studying their
[46:25] opponent all the way through the week
[46:27] until the big game they're analyzing
[46:29] they got different coaching staff they
[46:30] will analyze different players and then
[46:32] they will ad adopt a strategy to defeat
[46:35] that team on the day right so it's the
[46:37] same thing with you and I we need to be
[46:39] trained to meet our opponent because
[46:41] we're going to meet him amen we actually
[46:43] bump into the devil a lot more than you
[46:44] realize amen but the thing is if we are
[46:46] not trained to meet our opponent he's
[46:48] going to knock us out but we're not
[46:50] ordained to be knocked out we're
[46:52] ordained to knock him out amen so a real
[46:55] good fighter will study his opponent and
[46:57] know how to give him the you know
[46:59] knockout punch and it's the same thing
[47:01] with Christians you know you start with
[47:03] the golden rule John 3:16 for God so
[47:05] loved the world that he gave his only
[47:07] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[47:08] him shall not perish but have
[47:10] everlasting life you see you start out
[47:11] with that that but that just gets you
[47:13] out on the floor but then you've got to
[47:15] train for The Knockout punches because
[47:17] you're going to have to use them
[47:19] everybody knows that you have to train
[47:21] to hit your enemy so it's not just a
[47:23] train to receive blows or get blows away
[47:25] from you got to be trained to hit your
[47:26] enemy amen and always God uses his word
[47:30] we must remember God uses his word to
[47:32] defeat his enemy so how are you going to
[47:34] defeat him you're going to use the word
[47:35] of God so youve going to take the word
[47:37] in faith speak it across your lips
[47:38] doesn't matter how you feel good day bad
[47:40] day whatever more remember Jesus Jesus
[47:43] was 40 days in the wilderness no bread
[47:45] no water he was in that kind of
[47:47] condition he was at his weakest Point
[47:49] physically but yet he used the word of
[47:52] God to defeat the enemy in his great
[47:53] Temptations showing it doesn't matter
[47:55] matter how bad a day you have how you
[47:57] feel in your body what's going on you
[47:59] can use the same weapon and knock the
[48:01] devil out amen hallelujah so I'm so
[48:04] thankful we have that kind of weapon now
[48:06] so God but remember if God thought he
[48:08] could give us anything better than his
[48:09] word he would have given us something
[48:10] better amen but he gave us the best
[48:13] weapon we have the best weapon in
[48:14] existence is the word of God but you've
[48:16] got to believe your weapon if you doubt
[48:18] see the devil wants you to doubt your
[48:19] weapon amen he's wanting you to doubt
[48:21] that it won't work in your situation it
[48:23] works every situation it worked in the
[48:25] belly well with Jonah it worked in a
[48:27] lion Den with Daniel it worked in a
[48:29] flaming furnace with shadra mesach and
[48:30] ab Abednego it worked at a Red Sea it
[48:33] worked on Mount carel it worked every it
[48:35] worked in Jerusalem it worked down in
[48:37] hell it worked everywhere the word of
[48:39] God worked amen so our weapon will work
[48:41] in lat seej Hallelujah so we've got to
[48:44] have confidence that our weapon works
[48:45] but you've got to use your weapon
[48:46] hallelujah amen now if you ever want to
[48:48] reason with God's word no don't have a
[48:50] reason just believe it don't try to
[48:52] explain it don't try to figure it out
[48:54] now you cannot figure out so God is his
[48:57] word it's just just made to believe it's
[48:59] our strength just accept the word and
[49:01] anyone knows that a seed in the right
[49:03] kind of ground will produce its kind but
[49:05] you see the devil doesn't want us to
[49:07] believe uh he doesn't want us to believe
[49:09] the word of God now Satan as I said he
[49:12] was the anointed Cher that cover so he
[49:14] wants to get in between you and God and
[49:17] of course he will he wants worship so
[49:19] he'll try and get you to worship Him Now
[49:21] worship starts with agreement you've got
[49:23] to agree with any spirit before it can
[49:25] actually have any dominion over you you
[49:27] have to agree with it see so the devil
[49:29] wants you to agree with him now here he
[49:31] comes down into Eden this is the first
[49:33] time he comes against human beings and
[49:35] he speaks to Eve this is you know it's
[49:37] amazing that it's not even recorded in
[49:39] the scripture that God spoke to Eve the
[49:41] first one to preach was Satan and the
[49:43] serpent to Eve and the first thing you
[49:45] did was say y hath God said he proposes
[49:48] a question and you got to be careful
[49:50] because remember nowadays he doesn't
[49:52] come to in a physical form if you really
[49:54] saw the devil for what he was you'd run
[49:56] 10 million miles I remember there was a
[49:58] a brother from Australia he shared a
[50:00] testimony that him and some other
[50:01] brothers went to a restaurant and you
[50:02] know there was this waitress that came
[50:04] up she was anointed with a lust spirit
[50:06] and one of them saw that Spirit on on
[50:08] her and he just threw up in his plate
[50:10] and they left the restaurant because he
[50:12] saw that spirit for what it was and if
[50:14] we could see the enemy for who he is
[50:17] we'd all run a mile no one would touch
[50:19] any of his stuff no one would even
[50:20] entertain him for a second but you see
[50:22] he doesn't come that way he comes with
[50:25] making you think thoughts that he's
[50:27] giving you yeah so for example you know
[50:30] you may feel a bit down you say well
[50:32] your feeling comes in your body you feel
[50:33] a bit done you feel a bit depressed
[50:35] that's the devil telling you that but he
[50:37] gets you to think that way for you to
[50:39] agree with that and then what do you you
[50:41] you start feeling down and if you begin
[50:43] to focus on that thought you feel worse
[50:46] you don't who who's ever felt better
[50:47] saying yeah I feel down I feel depressed
[50:50] you never get happy but that's the devil
[50:52] trying to get you under his Dominion
[50:54] wanting you to believe is lifee because
[50:56] remember we have life and life more
[50:57] abundantly see any thought that comes
[50:59] into this mind contrary to the word of
[51:01] God you've got to identify that's not
[51:03] you that's not God that's Satan amen so
[51:06] you've got to you got to identify the
[51:08] devil at his tricks like that and deny
[51:11] him yes amen so he comes along he came
[51:13] along to say y hath God said he begins
[51:16] to add you know take away change the
[51:18] word a little bit you know apply to her
[51:20] reasoning and then she agreed with him
[51:23] and then what what she did is when she
[51:25] saw the tree she saw it was one to be
[51:27] desired so he will get you to reason and
[51:30] then he'll get you to make emotional
[51:32] decisions see her her decision was on
[51:35] emotion you know yeath God was a
[51:37] question then it was desire came in and
[51:39] then so her so her so her desire or her
[51:42] her what she did was based on her
[51:44] emotions who knows that emotional
[51:46] decisions are some of the worst you can
[51:47] ever make it's not based on fact you're
[51:50] not even thinking clearly it's just pure
[51:53] emotion you can't go with just pure
[51:55] emotion you've got to take it back to
[51:56] the word of God Amen so so that's how he
[51:59] came in and so he he he came in that way
[52:04] and then we know sin came into the
[52:06] world because the devil always try and
[52:09] be that anointed cherub that cover he
[52:11] wants to block your access to God now we
[52:13] can see this very clearly with Absalon
[52:16] when when Epsilon remember he had his
[52:18] motive in his heart was to cause a
[52:20] revolt and become king this is what the
[52:22] devil's agenda's always been he wants to
[52:23] be the God of this world and AB says in
[52:25] this day he is the God of this evil age
[52:28] amen so Absalon comes in in 2 Samuel 15
[52:31] and you know and then he and he got his
[52:32] chariots and his horses and 50 men to
[52:34] run before him and he went and he went
[52:36] and he rose up every morning and he
[52:38] stood by the king's gate and then when
[52:40] anyone man would come in that they had a
[52:43] controversy they had a judgment that the
[52:45] king had to make because the King was
[52:46] the final Authority in the Kingdom
[52:48] Absalon will call unto them what are you
[52:50] doing friend why are you here you know
[52:53] and and you know of what city are you
[52:54] and he said thy servant is one of the
[52:56] tribes of Israel and
[52:59] then and then what would happen is that
[53:01] the your man would would would tell or
[53:04] the person would tell Absalon their
[53:06] problem and you see Absalon would say
[53:08] yeah see thy matters are good and right
[53:10] see you've you've got a right to feel
[53:11] the way you feel you've got a right to
[53:13] feel angry you've got a right to feel
[53:15] unhappy you Christians fit their rights
[53:19] amen you know we have a right to praise
[53:22] God that everything that has breath
[53:23] praise the the Lord amen amen he says
[53:26] see thy matters are good and right you
[53:27] got a right to hold that Grudge no no
[53:29] let it go let's just let go of
[53:31] everything today that's not of God today
[53:33] let's just open our hands who's ever
[53:34] held on a say so tightly it's kind of
[53:36] can be hard to unpeel your fingers
[53:38] sometimes we've been gripping for things
[53:40] for years and our Spirits we're going to
[53:42] just Lord open my fingers get the blood
[53:44] back in them Lord that they can hold on
[53:46] to you or hold on to something a lot
[53:48] better amen amen he says thy uh thy
[53:51] matters are good and right but there is
[53:53] no man deputed of the king to hear these
[53:55] basically it's a shame no one can hear
[53:57] your hear your uh need and the Devil
[53:59] comes along and says God doesn't hear
[54:01] you but he puts it first person I wish
[54:03] God would hear my prayer I wish he would
[54:05] answer me that's the enemy coming along
[54:07] saying there's a shame no one can hear
[54:09] you God's ear is always open if there's
[54:12] not one sparrow that falls on the face
[54:14] of this planet God's not mindful of
[54:16] Jesus said and you're worth more than
[54:17] many sparrows and brother Braham comes
[54:20] along says one soul is worth more than
[54:22] 10,000
[54:23] worlds amen there's no man deputed of
[54:26] the king to hear the Epsilon said
[54:27] moreover oh that I were made judge in
[54:30] the land that every man which hath any
[54:32] suit or cause might come unto me and I
[54:34] could do them Justice and it was so that
[54:37] when any man came n to him to and to do
[54:40] him um obstinance uh he put forth his
[54:42] hand and took him and kissed him and on
[54:45] this man did abson to all Israel that
[54:47] came to the king but for judgment so
[54:50] Absalon stole the hearts of the men of
[54:52] Israel so what did he do he was at he
[54:54] was being that anointed cherub he was
[54:56] blocking the access to the King this is
[54:59] what the devil does he wants to block
[55:01] our access Amen to God if he can he
[55:04] wants to try and this has always been
[55:06] Satan's method okay remember we're
[55:08] studying his methods today I know this
[55:10] is probably nothing new but I just want
[55:11] to bring these things out am mean so
[55:13] what is he doing he's trying Epsilon was
[55:15] trying to control access to the king and
[55:17] tell people his own ideas in order to
[55:19] rule over them and that Satan's method
[55:21] has always been to try and block
[55:23] people's approach to God by telling them
[55:25] his way is the way which is always and
[55:27] it's but it's always contrary to the
[55:30] word brother R would say this in Satan
[55:32] zeden as a businessman that's not a
[55:34] Christian he'll work every scheme he can
[55:38] to make you see something the wrong way
[55:41] he's got a purpose and a personal gain
[55:43] in making you you doing that making you
[55:46] seeing it that way he'll show you
[55:48] everything he can and keep you off from
[55:50] the truth of it because he's got a
[55:52] feeling only for himself no matter how
[55:55] much he lies and cheats and whatever
[55:56] more he's got personal gain am mean to
[55:59] the enemy will try and make you see
[56:01] everything the wrong way he will never
[56:03] try and make you see anything the right
[56:05] way and especially where there's truth
[56:07] is always a battle I remember you know
[56:09] the first church I went to was a
[56:10] Pentecostal church I never had a thought
[56:12] coming to my mind I should leave a
[56:13] service or I should walk out or this but
[56:15] then when I went to Brother Greggs down
[56:17] in Christ Church a message Church
[56:18] wonderful group of Believers a thought
[56:21] kept coming in my mind I should leave I
[56:24] should get up I should leave the service
[56:26] I realized that wasn't me and that
[56:29] wasn't God that was the devil trying to
[56:30] get me to leave so I told I said Satan
[56:33] no no I'm not leaving you can leave I'm
[56:34] staying right put but you see he made it
[56:38] first person in my mind I should leave
[56:40] this what happened if I listened to that
[56:42] voice and walked out of the church where
[56:44] would I be
[56:45] today see we've got to be able to
[56:47] identify the thoughts of the enemy yes
[56:49] sir right but because he's trying to
[56:51] have dominion over you amen see because
[56:53] he see he'll try and show do everything
[56:55] the wrong way see it's the same thing
[56:56] with the prodical son the prodical son
[56:58] did not start off as a prodical son like
[57:01] any child he loved his parents but then
[57:04] as you know he came to an age of
[57:05] accountability became a teenage
[57:07] different things the devil started
[57:08] working on him making him resent his
[57:10] parents make him think that he was in a
[57:12] prison that he you know his parents were
[57:14] just wardens and didn't let him go do
[57:16] anything and the neighbor kids had all
[57:17] the fun and you know building resentment
[57:19] against against the parents this is what
[57:21] this is what the anointed cherub that's
[57:23] Fallen will do amen he'll try and get us
[57:25] to see everything the wrong way amen
[57:28] instead of instead of um the son seeing
[57:31] that his parents loved him were caring
[57:34] for him we're looking after him had his
[57:36] best interest in mind amen he he was
[57:39] beginning to see things through the
[57:40] devil's eyes you know look at what they
[57:43] do to you they make you work they make
[57:44] you do this they make you do that every
[57:47] parent Under the Sun makes the kids do
[57:48] things
[57:50] yes
[57:52] amen you don't see a bunch of you know
[57:54] but look the devil wants to work on our
[57:56] kids because we have the truth amen
[57:59] because he knows if they just get in
[58:01] contact with the Lord Jesus Christ and
[58:03] that flame is lit in their soul amen he
[58:05] is Unstoppable for them cuz God is Not
[58:07] Just rapturing parents he's rapturing
[58:09] children he's rapturing teenagers he's
[58:12] rapturing old people he's rapturing
[58:14] every part of the body amen amen I'm
[58:16] expecting amen it could be very soon
[58:18] William's not going to say Dad you play
[58:19] with me Dad we're going dad and he's
[58:21] going to be yay big he's going to be 18
[58:23] years old Hallelujah my kids my girls
[58:25] are going to sprout up a bit more
[58:27] hallelujah it's on I'm expecting that
[58:30] amen why cuz they're under the blood of
[58:32] Jesus Christ I believe amen but you see
[58:34] the devil try and work on them too look
[58:36] at what your dad's saying look at what
[58:37] your mom's saying your parents are no
[58:39] fun what about your friends and what
[58:40] about this it's the enemy trying to get
[58:43] them to agree with him to take them away
[58:46] and this is what happened with the
[58:47] prodical son see what happens is like
[58:49] brother Bram says is is who you are
[58:52] today is based on a decision you made
[58:54] about 5 years ago go yes so people will
[58:56] leave church before they leave church
[58:58] people start planning their Great Escape
[59:00] their prison break and it's the devil
[59:02] trying to get them from under the
[59:03] protection of the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:05] he'll work slowly but that you've got to
[59:07] stop him in his tracks am mean you got
[59:09] to stop him you got to stop him in your
[59:11] mind saying no Satan you're lying to me
[59:13] you're trying to take me to one side to
[59:15] take me out but I'm going to be Anointed
[59:17] with God to take you out amen I'm going
[59:19] to walk with God I'm not going to listen
[59:20] my parents love me am mean they can see
[59:22] more than I know they have greater
[59:24] understanding than I do yes amen you say
[59:27] well the world's different today no same
[59:29] Devils we fought here that's right they
[59:31] haven't left they've just rebranded
[59:33] themselves amen the same same Spirits
[59:36] same same anointing on music you know we
[59:39] we fought those Devils amen Spirit song
[59:42] games and computer games and
[59:43] entertainment we fought those Devils
[59:45] amen sports stars same anointing
[59:48] different sports star we fought those
[59:50] anointings we know what it's like to
[59:52] fight amen we know what it's like for
[59:54] God to set us free amen and if those
[59:56] things are so great why are we here why
[59:59] are we thankful God saved us why are we
[1:00:01] thankful that we've been redeemed why
[1:00:02] are we so happy that we're Christians
[1:00:05] because we're not in slavery anymore am
[1:00:07] mean if this was the worst and that was
[1:00:09] better this place would be empty come on
[1:00:11] that's
[1:00:12] right but the devil don't want you to
[1:00:14] think that way he wants you to think
[1:00:16] that there's nothing to it that there is
[1:00:17] a bunch of just rules and regulations
[1:00:19] and there and God is dead I'm sorry
[1:00:21] God's Not Dead I've had the experience
[1:00:24] I've made he stepped out of History to
[1:00:25] me he's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:27] forever amen and it's not just thoughts
[1:00:30] that you make that control you it's
[1:00:32] demon powers or it's God I remember the
[1:00:34] first uh house I I know I've shared this
[1:00:36] a lot but I'll share it one more time
[1:00:37] the first house that we have uh
[1:00:39] Christine and I rented here in
[1:00:40] Wellington we didn't know it till the
[1:00:42] day we left but but but the previous
[1:00:44] tenant used it as a brothel and and when
[1:00:47] we moved into that house Christine said
[1:00:48] that she saw a dark figure walking
[1:00:50] around and I would leave and go to work
[1:00:53] and then when I came back and as soon as
[1:00:55] I saw this saw the house I felt this
[1:00:56] oppression come on and we started
[1:00:59] fighting and we had trouble but we
[1:01:02] realized it wasn't us causing the
[1:01:04] trouble see you've got to identify as
[1:01:06] the enemy trying to tear you apart
[1:01:08] trying to tear your family apart trying
[1:01:09] to build walls see because we remembered
[1:01:12] what it was like to live in harmony we
[1:01:14] thought we are living below our
[1:01:15] privilege there is an evil spirit in
[1:01:17] this house and we need to pray that the
[1:01:20] anointing breaks the Yoke of that thing
[1:01:23] amen why cuz the devil wants to put an
[1:01:24] impression on you trying to make you
[1:01:26] think this is how life is no life isn't
[1:01:28] meant to be a constant battle and
[1:01:30] fighting fussing trouble and it's not
[1:01:31] some political debate and all this
[1:01:33] arguments and stuff it's joy peace
[1:01:35] Harmony and the Holy Ghost amen so we
[1:01:38] prayed and I don't know how God did it
[1:01:39] but but as but his Spirit came down one
[1:01:41] time we were praying and I felt a real
[1:01:43] fear come upon me it was a real feeling
[1:01:45] I rebuked that enemy I said Satan you
[1:01:48] have no right to put your fear upon me
[1:01:50] see the devil wants to make you feel
[1:01:52] afraid you got to you got to deny that
[1:01:54] thing you have to deny that thing you
[1:01:57] say it's either you own it or you don't
[1:01:59] I'm not owning anything the devil has
[1:02:01] for me amen CU it doesn't belong to me
[1:02:03] amen so then after we finished praying
[1:02:05] about that Christian said how do you
[1:02:06] know that I was feeling fear said why I
[1:02:08] said I was feeling it too and then we
[1:02:09] were praying a time after that and I
[1:02:11] looked up at her and she had a shocked
[1:02:13] look on her face she was looking at the
[1:02:14] door uh that was going out of our lounge
[1:02:16] and she saw that thing stand there and I
[1:02:19] went and opened the door of the house
[1:02:20] and we rebuked it the anointing came
[1:02:22] down the thing was cast out and other
[1:02:24] people came into our home and said it's
[1:02:25] so peaceful here we didn't fight I
[1:02:28] didn't feel that oppression no more
[1:02:29] didn't have those troubled feelings no
[1:02:31] more why because that enemy that was in
[1:02:33] that house left and it goes to show the
[1:02:36] things you do in in secret will bring an
[1:02:37] anointing amen so you can pray in secret
[1:02:40] and you can bring the Holy Ghost
[1:02:41] anointing you can love the Lord sing to
[1:02:43] him and God will come down or you can do
[1:02:45] things of darkness and you'll bring
[1:02:46] another anointing I would rather live
[1:02:48] with the anointing of the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:50] Liberty and freedom than live Bound by
[1:02:52] darkness and trouble and depression
[1:02:55] amen so hallelujah it's more than just
[1:02:57] thoughts see it's it's it's a a spirit
[1:03:00] motivating you to go a certain
[1:03:03] way amen so the prodical son it says in
[1:03:07] the scripture I don't have it on me
[1:03:08] right now but it says you know when he
[1:03:10] went to the foreign land he lost
[1:03:12] everything spent all of his father's
[1:03:14] inheritance that the father gave him and
[1:03:16] he's now feeding he's feeding pigs she's
[1:03:18] a Jewish man you a Jewish young boy
[1:03:21] living with unclean animals and then
[1:03:24] he's even so hungry he wants to eat the
[1:03:26] pig slop but then the Bible says and
[1:03:28] then he came to himself and brother ad
[1:03:30] says it's actually the prayers of
[1:03:32] appearance actually caused the angel of
[1:03:34] the Lord to come down into the pig pin
[1:03:36] where he was and cause that evil spirit
[1:03:38] to come off the mind of the son and he
[1:03:41] came to himself and realized actually
[1:03:42] this my father's servants live better
[1:03:45] Hallelujah than this I'm going to go
[1:03:46] back home Hallelujah I'm going to go
[1:03:49] back home what happened is that that
[1:03:50] anointed Cher that covered him was
[1:03:53] blasted away by the power of prayer and
[1:03:56] caused him to come back to his right
[1:03:57] mind amen then he went back to his
[1:03:59] father's house see this we got to have
[1:04:02] full confidence God hears our prayers am
[1:04:04] me God knows exactly what's going on we
[1:04:06] can have full confidence that God will
[1:04:09] answer our prayers in his season but you
[1:04:11] see the enemy comes along and tries to
[1:04:13] discourage us because of
[1:04:15] time he tries to think well it's been so
[1:04:18] long why why why haven't you had the
[1:04:21] outcome you want the Bible says ask and
[1:04:23] you shall receive amen he uses the
[1:04:25] scripture against you does he not he
[1:04:26] uses it against me and so he says oh
[1:04:29] yeah but you prayed for healing why why
[1:04:31] aren you healed or you prayed for this
[1:04:32] your family why is this happening all
[1:04:34] and he wants you to agree with his doubt
[1:04:37] cuz he wants you to get you to think
[1:04:39] that your prayers do not have any impact
[1:04:42] and our Prophet taught us that the
[1:04:43] weakest of Christians when they get down
[1:04:45] on their knees the kingdom of Hell
[1:04:47] shakes I believe that that's more than
[1:04:49] just nice imagery I believe that's a
[1:04:51] reality where you can get down and pray
[1:04:53] you can be the weakest you say well I'm
[1:04:55] feeling weak but you still shake the
[1:04:56] kingdom of Hell amen cuz you're a
[1:04:58] Believer amen hallelujah so now so so he
[1:05:02] you know begins to try and tell us that
[1:05:04] you know these things you know don't
[1:05:05] count and don't matter and what's the
[1:05:07] point see he's trying to get you to
[1:05:09] agree with
[1:05:10] him but we have a right to cast him out
[1:05:13] and deny him see the enemy brother
[1:05:17] Braham says in the contest is going to
[1:05:19] study our strategy with the word so he's
[1:05:22] going to study you with how you use the
[1:05:24] word see if he sees that you are just
[1:05:27] only rejoicing because of instant
[1:05:29] Miracles he's going to use that against
[1:05:31] you right he's going to study your
[1:05:33] strategy do you pray how's your prayer
[1:05:36] life he'll try and break your prayer
[1:05:37] life try and break your reading time do
[1:05:39] all those things because he's trying to
[1:05:41] wear you down that's right amen but you
[1:05:44] see the thing is our this is not a war
[1:05:46] of attrition this is total victory for
[1:05:49] you and I right because remember greater
[1:05:52] greater is he that's in you that's he
[1:05:54] that's in the world so an enemy can have
[1:05:56] all of his tactics all of his
[1:05:58] headquarters all of his planning but an
[1:06:00] anointed son or daughter of God Will
[1:06:02] Conquer amen amen prise the Lord amen
[1:06:07] you
[1:06:08] see he always try and discourage when it
[1:06:11] seems that something doesn't seem to be
[1:06:13] happening like your prayer but we know
[1:06:15] the Bible says that the word of God is a
[1:06:17] seed right and I've never seen a farmer
[1:06:21] plant seeds and then the next day dig
[1:06:23] them up see if they're growing and then
[1:06:25] plant them again and then dig them up
[1:06:27] the next after that and see if they're
[1:06:29] growing no they commit them to the Earth
[1:06:31] and let the water rain and everything
[1:06:34] they they have full confidence that
[1:06:36] there's life in that seed that the
[1:06:38] atmosphere is Right The Season's right
[1:06:39] it's going to bring forth exactly what's
[1:06:41] in that seed and it's the same thing
[1:06:43] with prayer am mean you've got to have
[1:06:45] confidence God has heard your prayer
[1:06:47] who's ever prayed through for something
[1:06:48] really had to that peace just come and
[1:06:50] say God I know the answer's coming I
[1:06:52] don't know when but it's coming you have
[1:06:53] confidence so what do you what have you
[1:06:55] done you've actually committed that
[1:06:57] prayer to God it's like a farmer putting
[1:06:58] seed in the ground right you've
[1:07:00] committed to God so so then you say what
[1:07:02] should I do now thank God the answer is
[1:07:04] coming thank God it's going to happen I
[1:07:07] mean water it with praise am mean just
[1:07:10] like the farmer lets that maybe he's got
[1:07:12] irrigation maybe it's just going to rain
[1:07:14] but he Waters that seed that it'll come
[1:07:16] to pass it's the same thing with you and
[1:07:18] I water our prayers with praise amen
[1:07:22] amen and what will happen they will come
[1:07:24] to
[1:07:25] life but the devil want us to say say no
[1:07:27] nothing's happening it's happening right
[1:07:30] you got to believe it amen that's right
[1:07:33] you see there's different ways that the
[1:07:34] devil can get a hold of Our Lives
[1:07:36] brother B would speak about this in the
[1:07:37] church AG book he'd say there's in the
[1:07:39] discernment line he says I wish you
[1:07:41] could stand with me and see the faces of
[1:07:43] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:07:45] exposed now it isn't the people that I'm
[1:07:47] talking about that is that Satan has got
[1:07:49] a hold in their
[1:07:51] lives hold in their lives through sin
[1:07:53] and indifference and
[1:07:55] disease but you should see their faces
[1:07:58] Satan knows he's going to be exposed and
[1:07:59] the most peculiar changes come across
[1:08:02] people's countenance Satan is afraid he
[1:08:04] knows that if the spirit is about to let
[1:08:06] the people know his works that is why he
[1:08:08] hates these meetings so much shall I say
[1:08:10] he still hates the word of God being
[1:08:12] preached because the word of God is a
[1:08:13] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:08:15] the heart now he says Satan gets a hold
[1:08:17] of people's lives through sin
[1:08:19] indifference and disease so I'm just
[1:08:21] going to M what it's easy to know how he
[1:08:23] can get a hold of someone's life through
[1:08:25] sin which is unbelief but he can get a
[1:08:27] hold of our lives through indifference
[1:08:29] and disease so we can't stop getting
[1:08:32] sick we're in these bodies it's going to
[1:08:33] be wonderful when they change one day
[1:08:36] hallelujah we're not going to be in
[1:08:37] eternity in these bodies no we're going
[1:08:38] to be in a whole new body that can never
[1:08:40] get sick never have trouble sorrow no
[1:08:42] nothing can happen there amen amen but
[1:08:45] you see it's how we conduct ourselves in
[1:08:47] the sickness that matters see brother
[1:08:49] Braham says that we should conduct
[1:08:51] ourselves like son Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:53] God through the trial am mean you see
[1:08:55] Daniel when he was going through the
[1:08:57] great trial when the Commandment came
[1:08:58] that he couldn't pray for 30 days to God
[1:09:01] oh man he conducted himself like a Son
[1:09:03] of God through that trial what did he do
[1:09:05] he opened up the windows he he he prayed
[1:09:08] towards Jerusalem gave glory to Jehovah
[1:09:11] God Amen he did what he always did but
[1:09:13] and then when he's going to be thrown to
[1:09:14] the Den of Lions he he was not
[1:09:16] intimidated by the Lions then he
[1:09:19] conducted himself said my God is able to
[1:09:21] deliver me if I'm going to get I'm if
[1:09:23] I'm going to become breakfast I'll
[1:09:25] become breakfast I'm still going to
[1:09:26] serve God hallelujah he conducted
[1:09:29] himself as a Son of God through the
[1:09:30] trial Hallelujah I trust we can do the
[1:09:33] same thing amen when trouble strikes us
[1:09:35] praise God we're still his child amen
[1:09:38] he's still in control we can still trust
[1:09:40] in him for everything amen amen if if
[1:09:43] disease strikes Us Praise the Lord our
[1:09:46] God is can heal amen he's Our Redeemer
[1:09:49] amen who's with me today amen let's
[1:09:51] let's conduct ourselves like sons and
[1:09:53] daughter Daughters of God believing his
[1:09:55] promises no matter what's going on
[1:09:57] around us amen but you see Satan can get
[1:10:00] a hold of our lives through that disease
[1:10:02] why he'd say God can't heal you your
[1:10:06] case is too big you know you prayed for
[1:10:08] it why isn't the answer came why isn't
[1:10:11] God giving you instant if he's a God if
[1:10:13] he's the Jehovah of Miracles why isn't
[1:10:15] he given you a miracle and God will use
[1:10:17] medicine he'll use love he use you know
[1:10:20] you prayed for it there's that natural
[1:10:21] healing process comes into the body it
[1:10:23] can be instant Miracle be all these
[1:10:24] different things few well we don't have
[1:10:28] communion foot washing enough but a few
[1:10:29] of them ago amen Christine memb she had
[1:10:31] that frozen shoulder couldn't raise your
[1:10:33] hand above this she was being prayed for
[1:10:35] beinging the foot washing and God
[1:10:37] instantly released that frozen shoulder
[1:10:38] and she came in into the service I you
[1:10:40] know and she said I want to testify just
[1:10:42] raised up her hands like this Hallelujah
[1:10:45] so can be instant can take time praise
[1:10:49] God how God you know but the devil
[1:10:51] always see he wants us to look through
[1:10:53] it his way way yeah like he when he came
[1:10:55] to Jesus in the wilderness says if thou
[1:10:57] be the Son of God turn these bread uh
[1:10:59] turn these stones into bread basically
[1:11:02] prove yourself based on what I want you
[1:11:04] to do jump through my Hoops but but
[1:11:07] Jesus didn't clown for the devil he
[1:11:10] didn't prove nothing are you following
[1:11:11] me today he didn't prove nothing he just
[1:11:13] said get behind me Satan see real Holy
[1:11:16] Ghost leadership is not obeying the
[1:11:18] devil amen that's what that's what
[1:11:21] because the devil wanted Jesus to follow
[1:11:22] his leadership yeah but Jesus of course
[1:11:25] full with the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] just no he he just withstood him with
[1:11:28] the
[1:11:30] word but then there's also
[1:11:33] indifference the devil wants to make us
[1:11:35] cold indifferent
[1:11:37] formal and then he can get a grip of our
[1:11:39] lives through that way and I think
[1:11:40] that's probably the biggest thing we
[1:11:41] Face especially in this country where we
[1:11:44] have everything on a gold platter not a
[1:11:46] silver one we've upgraded it's gold amen
[1:11:49] but so so it can bring IND difference
[1:11:50] because it's not a drive I've got a you
[1:11:52] know there's not a drive drive to live
[1:11:54] or drive to survive because hey someone
[1:11:56] else will look after someone else will
[1:11:57] do the job amen so we but we never want
[1:12:00] to let indifference what the devil
[1:12:03] through indifference get a hold of Our
[1:12:04] Lives we should always be fervent amen
[1:12:07] loving the Lord praising him amen being
[1:12:09] thankful for what he's done our
[1:12:11] testimony should never become common to
[1:12:13] ourselves I mean even if we've just been
[1:12:15] called it's a miracle to be called even
[1:12:18] if there's been a desire in your heart I
[1:12:19] want to know you Lord that's a miracle
[1:12:21] you should celebrate that amen
[1:12:23] Hallelujah Lord there's a deep calling
[1:12:24] to the Deep you put that in My Heart
[1:12:26] Lord this is amazing am mean God's
[1:12:28] calling me like he called Abraham
[1:12:30] Hallelujah I want to walk with you Lord
[1:12:31] because you want to walk with me wonder
[1:12:34] praise the Lord amen so we should never
[1:12:35] let the enemy try and coming through
[1:12:36] indifference you see but he always he
[1:12:39] this is what he wants us to
[1:12:42] have
[1:12:44] amen praise the Lord you see we
[1:12:48] shouldn't this is now he's going to try
[1:12:52] and come come against with all these
[1:12:54] things but you've got to make a decision
[1:12:57] see brother Bram says this now he says
[1:12:59] you have to make a decision are you
[1:13:01] going to feel and say is my heart better
[1:13:04] or is my stomach not as bad as it quite
[1:13:06] as bad as it was can I move my fingers
[1:13:08] just a little bit don't think about that
[1:13:10] make your decision that Christ heals you
[1:13:11] and that settles it and you're well okay
[1:13:13] because the enemy wants you to look at
[1:13:15] symptoms he wants to look at you every
[1:13:16] he wants you to look at everything but
[1:13:18] the promise of God okay just like the
[1:13:21] just like Caleb and Joshua see the enemy
[1:13:23] wanted to cover them in unbelief just
[1:13:25] like the rest of Israel but they didn't
[1:13:27] they didn't say there's no Giants they
[1:13:29] didn't say there's no problems right
[1:13:31] they didn't say there's no enemies to
[1:13:32] take but they said God has given us the
[1:13:34] land Hallelujah let's go get it what so
[1:13:37] they weren't looking through the enemy's
[1:13:39] eyes like the other 10 spies were
[1:13:40] they're looking through the promise of
[1:13:43] God Amen this is and and this is how we
[1:13:46] need to be in this day God has made his
[1:13:48] promises so alive in this day amen we
[1:13:51] have so many testimonies of of of God's
[1:13:54] word becoming alive amen that we we
[1:13:57] should never settle for second best just
[1:13:58] like I was saying about the testimony of
[1:14:01] of of Christian I's first house we could
[1:14:03] have sealed for well I guess we've moved
[1:14:05] to a new city and it's stressful to move
[1:14:06] and I've I've got a job and all the
[1:14:08] other these different pressures of Life
[1:14:09] have come and I guess this is just how
[1:14:11] things have to be we could have settled
[1:14:13] for that but we remembered a time of
[1:14:15] peace and love and harmony and we
[1:14:17] realize an enemy had come in to try and
[1:14:19] destroy our lives and we didn't put up
[1:14:22] with it amen so you can either come
[1:14:24] under the anointing of the enemy saying
[1:14:26] this is how things have to be or you can
[1:14:28] look at the promises of God and say it
[1:14:29] shouldn't be this way I withstand you
[1:14:32] Satan you are a defeated being I'm not
[1:14:34] putting up with you see it's the
[1:14:35] decision we make about iten amen that we
[1:14:38] can either live without our symptoms
[1:14:41] live with live actually sorry based on
[1:14:43] symptoms and problem situation or we can
[1:14:46] live according to the word of God
[1:14:48] hallelujah amen amen amen why because
[1:14:51] the Bible says he's not given us the
[1:14:53] spirit of fear but love power and a
[1:14:55] sound mind but the devil says you should
[1:14:57] be afraid it's a fearful time look
[1:14:59] what's happening in the news he tries to
[1:15:00] amplify things in your mind what's going
[1:15:02] to happen to your children what's going
[1:15:03] to happen to your spouse what's going to
[1:15:05] happen to you look at the economics and
[1:15:06] all these things and tries to get you to
[1:15:08] focus on all those troubles we live in a
[1:15:10] time of trouble but there's a place we
[1:15:12] can be hidden and it's not under the
[1:15:14] wings of this Fallen cherub of demon
[1:15:17] it's under the wings of the almighty
[1:15:19] amen we can trust under his wings amen
[1:15:22] and he will look after us no matter what
[1:15:24] goes on Lord hallelujah now he says now
[1:15:28] what if a farmer went and planted a big
[1:15:30] wheel of um uh a big a big field of
[1:15:33] Wheat and every morning he got out there
[1:15:35] and dug all that wheat up so so I'm
[1:15:37] repeating this for a point to see if it
[1:15:39] was going to sprout or not as long as he
[1:15:41] keeps digging up the seed it'll never
[1:15:42] grow every time you dig it up it delays
[1:15:44] another day and every time you look at
[1:15:46] your symptoms it delays you too in your
[1:15:49] healing yeah amen a farmer just commits
[1:15:51] a seed to the ground he wants the best
[1:15:53] seed he can find he puts it in the
[1:15:55] ground because he's made a decision he
[1:15:56] wants a crop so he goes and gets the
[1:15:59] best seed he can find and I think if we
[1:16:01] just decide I'm going to serve God come
[1:16:03] what me it's going to be you're going to
[1:16:05] have a good crop amen amen you say Lord
[1:16:08] I want to see you live amen I want to
[1:16:09] see your word become a reality of my
[1:16:11] life amen you'll get a good crop amen
[1:16:15] amen be see the
[1:16:16] enemy see brother Braham said when he
[1:16:19] was 12 years old when he came to the age
[1:16:21] of accountability he said he would have
[1:16:23] been saved then but a spirit hung over
[1:16:25] him saying just wait a little bit longer
[1:16:28] what was that that was that anointed
[1:16:29] Cher that c was trying to stop him
[1:16:31] meeting God just wait a bit longer so
[1:16:34] how does that thought come in I'm young
[1:16:36] there's a lot of life I need to
[1:16:38] experience first what about my friends
[1:16:41] what will this person think I know what
[1:16:42] peer pressure is like it help me back
[1:16:44] for years but when I came to a point
[1:16:46] where I'm like I'm sick of this I'm sick
[1:16:48] of being miserable just having enough of
[1:16:51] God to be miserable we shouldn't be
[1:16:53] miserable we should enjoy the Lord amen
[1:16:55] he wants us to enjoy Christianity he
[1:16:57] wants us to enjoy our walk with him amen
[1:17:00] but see it's a spirit he said a spirit
[1:17:01] kept hanging over him he says that's the
[1:17:03] reason why you weren't saved at the age
[1:17:05] of accountability a spirit you got in a
[1:17:07] crowd and that hovered over you and kept
[1:17:09] hanging over you you wanted to do right
[1:17:12] there's not a man that's got his right
[1:17:14] mind but wants to do right but there is
[1:17:16] something that won't let you do it is
[1:17:17] that right that's the devil he says
[1:17:20] hallelujah Christ paid your healing and
[1:17:22] your salvation now here it is you get
[1:17:24] ready he commissioned his church to cast
[1:17:25] them Devils out there you are in my name
[1:17:28] they shall cast out Devils you ain't
[1:17:29] going to heal nobody but you're going to
[1:17:31] cast The Devil away from them so they
[1:17:33] can accept the healing I've already done
[1:17:35] that's right preacher stood on the
[1:17:36] platform and preach the gospel devil
[1:17:38] scatter the man comes to the altar under
[1:17:40] conviction I say I and says I want to
[1:17:43] get saved he never saved the man he cast
[1:17:45] The Devil out that's right and the man
[1:17:47] got saved he come accepted his salvation
[1:17:50] the same thing by Divine Healing you
[1:17:51] sick people here this morning believe
[1:17:53] that and been born again and are Sons
[1:17:55] and Daughters of God Christ has already
[1:17:57] healed you the only thing that keeps you
[1:17:59] from being well this morning is a spirit
[1:18:01] hanging over you that won't fully let
[1:18:03] you go out yonder and believe God's
[1:18:05] promise that he's done it but you see
[1:18:07] we're here to create an atmosphere to
[1:18:09] cast The Devil away that every promise
[1:18:12] we have need of that we can receive amen
[1:18:14] it's just like the four men that had the
[1:18:17] crippled friend on the on the on the cot
[1:18:21] and Jesus was in the house teaching and
[1:18:24] they couldn't get him in because of the
[1:18:25] press they knew their friend was not in
[1:18:28] his ought to be condition right they
[1:18:31] knew I remember him when he walked I
[1:18:33] remember him when he enjoyed the Lord I
[1:18:35] remember him when he shouted I remember
[1:18:36] him when he got baptized I remember him
[1:18:38] when he had victory in his life but some
[1:18:40] a sickness is coming and crippled his
[1:18:42] walk but we know the one that can undo
[1:18:45] all the crippling but you see because
[1:18:47] they knew it could be done they did not
[1:18:50] stop when they saw obstacles they
[1:18:51] thought well what can we do and they
[1:18:53] said well let's go on top of the house
[1:18:55] and let's pull apart the obstacle until
[1:18:58] we get our friend into the presence of
[1:19:00] Jesus Christ am mean and that's what
[1:19:02] prayer does friends as it takes the
[1:19:04] tiles off the roof am mean that you can
[1:19:06] lower your family you can lower your
[1:19:08] friends you can lower one another into
[1:19:11] the presence of God Amen that the
[1:19:13] anointing of God will break that yoke
[1:19:14] off their life because Jesus said when
[1:19:17] he saw their faith he said your sins be
[1:19:20] forgiven thee or what's easier to say
[1:19:22] your sins be forgiven or take up your
[1:19:24] bed or rise up and walk but but Jesus if
[1:19:27] you go read it he says when he saw their
[1:19:29] faith not the crippled man's Faith their
[1:19:32] faith maybe he thoughts cuz the devil
[1:19:34] may be got in his mind thinking I'll
[1:19:36] never walk again I've got py the doctor
[1:19:39] say I can't be well it's an
[1:19:40] impossibility that I you know that I can
[1:19:42] ever be well there's no medical science
[1:19:44] that can help me so I've just got to
[1:19:47] accept that see this is what the devil
[1:19:48] get you to think you've just got to
[1:19:49] accept how you are if you're down that's
[1:19:52] just how you've got to be you look at
[1:19:55] all life's problems you've had a hard
[1:19:57] Road you've had a tough past you've had
[1:19:59] problems and this is why you feel this
[1:20:00] way don't agree with that amen don't
[1:20:03] agree with that amen that man was
[1:20:05] crippled but his friend said no he can
[1:20:08] walk again and we should have that same
[1:20:10] kind of faith for one another I can see
[1:20:12] my kids saved I can see them filled with
[1:20:14] the Holy Ghost I can see Joy return to
[1:20:16] the church I can see people dance Amen
[1:20:19] in Liberty I can see God move in power
[1:20:22] again amen because I've seen it before
[1:20:24] this is what this is our inheritance
[1:20:25] this is what it should be like so what
[1:20:27] do we do we start praying to pull the
[1:20:29] obstacles
[1:20:30] away sir amen if you have that same
[1:20:33] determination Lord once more Lord move
[1:20:36] in our midst Lord once more Lord Heal
[1:20:38] the sick once more Lord fill with the
[1:20:40] Holy Ghost once more Lord take a wayward
[1:20:42] son a Wayward Daughter and bring them
[1:20:44] home once more Lord take the spiritual
[1:20:47] cripples off their cck that they can
[1:20:49] carry that thing away and and say the
[1:20:50] Lord took this off took me off this this
[1:20:52] morning once more Lord amen I believe
[1:20:54] Tes can come off sunlight can come down
[1:20:57] amen and God can come into the presence
[1:20:59] and into our midst and he can do the
[1:21:01] miraculous amen do you believe it am
[1:21:04] mean don't listen to The Devil's lies he
[1:21:05] says you've lived like this too
[1:21:07] long who said Moses was 80 years old
[1:21:11] backslid Prophet just on the backside of
[1:21:13] deser and God said now's your time amen
[1:21:15] so you're never too old you're never too
[1:21:17] young for God to change your life amen
[1:21:19] because the anointing the yoke is broken
[1:21:21] because of the anointing you see we have
[1:21:24] been anointed Amen in this end time to
[1:21:26] break the anointing of the devil that's
[1:21:29] the Yoke amen the oppression the lies of
[1:21:31] the enemy am mean to undo amen all of
[1:21:34] his Works amen amen hallelujah amen so I
[1:21:37] think I've spoken enough about the devil
[1:21:39] now let's speak about God because this
[1:21:40] is what we' have come Amen to realize
[1:21:42] that this word Works amen his anointing
[1:21:44] is true amen I remember when Chris and I
[1:21:47] when we first went to Papa new guine
[1:21:48] this on our honeymoon amen and and and
[1:21:51] and and my parents had this housemid
[1:21:53] called Ruth she couldn't speak English
[1:21:55] she just spoke pigeon but she spoke
[1:21:57] until the cows came home you you had to
[1:21:59] interrupt to get a word in edgewise she
[1:22:01] just talking talking talking you know
[1:22:03] but then when we went up for our
[1:22:04] honeymoon she was quiet didn't say a
[1:22:07] word I thought something's wrong with
[1:22:08] her because this is not how she usually
[1:22:11] is and before we went up on our
[1:22:14] honeymoon she was carrying her Outrigger
[1:22:15] Canoe down the beach and she slipped
[1:22:17] over dislocated her kneecap went right
[1:22:19] up on her knee you know snapped some
[1:22:21] tendons didn't know about the tendons at
[1:22:22] the time and and and they um and she got
[1:22:25] taken to the hospital by my mom and they
[1:22:27] were going to operate on her leg to put
[1:22:29] everything like reattached attendons and
[1:22:31] things and she just said no you just put
[1:22:33] my kneecap back put my leg in a cast God
[1:22:36] is going to fix my knee but you see as I
[1:22:40] read that quote the devil can get him
[1:22:41] through disease and she said this is
[1:22:45] after when when when she was laying in
[1:22:48] her bed with that cast on she said this
[1:22:50] Dark Cloud came over her wow and made
[1:22:52] her this person that doesn't speak much
[1:22:54] at all so we found her in this condition
[1:22:57] we had this house that that that that
[1:22:59] that we had and we invited to come over
[1:23:01] one evening to to pray for her cuz I was
[1:23:04] like the guy carrying one of the four
[1:23:06] men carrying their friend on the
[1:23:07] stretcher I thought Ruth is not in her
[1:23:10] ought to be conditioned Something's
[1:23:11] Happened to her but I want to take the
[1:23:14] tiles off to get into the presence of
[1:23:15] God Amen so so she came in we showed a
[1:23:18] Gary Walker's testimony you know was it
[1:23:20] four times dead but alive you know the
[1:23:22] car you know multiple times and he's
[1:23:24] alive today amen we showed her that and
[1:23:26] we begin to explain to her how the
[1:23:27] reason these troubles have come upon her
[1:23:29] is because she's embraced the truth and
[1:23:31] we anointed her with oil now before she
[1:23:33] ever came into the house my expectation
[1:23:35] was that because by that stage soorry
[1:23:39] hope I'm explaining it right but by that
[1:23:41] stage the cast was off her leg but she
[1:23:43] couldn't even She had she could barely
[1:23:45] bend that leg that was damaged so my
[1:23:48] expectation was after he prayed for us
[1:23:49] she'd run out of the house screaming and
[1:23:51] rejoicing that's my expectation after we
[1:23:54] anointed her with oil and prayed for her
[1:23:56] that Spirit left her and she started
[1:23:58] just jabbering away talking like she was
[1:24:00] her old self Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:24:03] amen so and then she told us a story of
[1:24:06] when she was in the cast in her house
[1:24:08] that that dark Spirit Came Upon her amen
[1:24:11] so she came back to her ought to be
[1:24:13] conditioned spiritually back to her old
[1:24:15] self I went up to papini a couple of
[1:24:18] months after that and she just had a
[1:24:19] slight limp now she told me about the
[1:24:22] tendon snapping in the accident after
[1:24:24] that now tendons are like uh bungee
[1:24:26] cords right they don't just reattach
[1:24:28] when they snap they go like this so who
[1:24:31] did this God did that amen God did that
[1:24:35] amen so didn't just restore her back to
[1:24:36] a spiritually right condition but
[1:24:39] restored her
[1:24:40] leg amen but the only reason that well
[1:24:43] it was God's grace but there was
[1:24:44] something in us that said something's
[1:24:46] wrong with her let's pray until
[1:24:48] everything becomes right again
[1:24:50] hallelujah amen and I think that's how
[1:24:52] we should be amen hallelujah why because
[1:24:54] the Yoke breaks the anointing I mean
[1:24:57] sorry yeah no the anointing breaks the
[1:25:00] Yoke I'm glad someone's
[1:25:04] listening you see so the devil wants to
[1:25:06] W off the promises of God he wants to
[1:25:08] keep us away from everything that we
[1:25:10] would have in the have in the Lord but
[1:25:11] the anointing of God breaks the Yol amen
[1:25:15] it causes it causes Deliverance to come
[1:25:17] into the house of God hallelujah amen so
[1:25:20] because we are ordained
[1:25:22] Amen to cast out the enemy amen he wants
[1:25:26] us the enemy wants us to think that God
[1:25:28] will only do things a certain way and we
[1:25:31] just have to live with being
[1:25:33] underprivileged the devil's lying amen
[1:25:36] we are ordained to walk in joy and love
[1:25:39] and Liberty and be happy and have peace
[1:25:41] in our hearts that's what we're ordained
[1:25:43] to have I mean we're not called to be
[1:25:45] troubled and anxious see anxiety people
[1:25:48] say my anxiety or my stress levels or my
[1:25:53] depression all that is is the devil says
[1:25:55] you're depressed feel this way you feel
[1:25:57] anxious feel this way you you got fear
[1:26:00] feel this way and they've said yes thank
[1:26:01] you I'll take that they don't realize
[1:26:03] they're bought into it so we should
[1:26:05] never say my anxiety because it's not
[1:26:07] meant to be yours or my depression CU
[1:26:09] it's not meant to be yours these things
[1:26:10] are a spirit amen you say no no my joy
[1:26:14] cuz that actually is yours my peace that
[1:26:16] actually is yours my love that God's
[1:26:18] given me that is actually yours amen
[1:26:21] amen that's how it should be you see we
[1:26:22] are called to cast down imaginations and
[1:26:25] every High thing that exalts itself
[1:26:27] against the knowledge of God I mean so
[1:26:29] that is everything that tries to be
[1:26:31] greater in your life than his word amen
[1:26:34] see the spirit of fear comes in I'm
[1:26:36] anxious I'm afraid whatever more you got
[1:26:38] to withstand that thing and say no I
[1:26:40] will not be fearful amen amen God has
[1:26:43] not given me the spirit of fear but love
[1:26:46] power and a sound mind amen see it's not
[1:26:49] it's not God's idea to make you fearful
[1:26:51] amen no it's the enemy's idea to make
[1:26:53] you fearful Lord hallelujah all those
[1:26:57] things amen all those things are
[1:27:00] only
[1:27:02] vanities amen just lying vanities
[1:27:05] everything of the work work of the enemy
[1:27:06] is lying vanities it says in Psalms
[1:27:09] 11937 turn away mine eyes from beholding
[1:27:12] vanity amen and Quicken thou me in thy
[1:27:14] way amen so so Lord turn my eyes from
[1:27:17] beholding vanity see the problem with
[1:27:20] see the Mental Health crisis we have in
[1:27:21] this cuz everyone looks at themselves
[1:27:24] right you want to get rid of mental
[1:27:25] health problems look at the Lord look at
[1:27:27] his promises look what he has made you
[1:27:29] to be amen if he says I'm an overcomer
[1:27:32] I'm an overcomer amen if he says that
[1:27:34] I've got joy UNS spiggle full of glory
[1:27:36] amen I receive that amen I deny the
[1:27:39] depression and take the joy amen amen
[1:27:41] you see Caleb and Joshua did not let the
[1:27:44] sze of the enemies intimidate them they
[1:27:45] just took God at his word and when we
[1:27:48] can put aside what we feel what we
[1:27:50] imagine what we see take face feel hair
[1:27:52] smell any of those things take those
[1:27:54] things if they're all contrary to the
[1:27:55] word of God you throw them aside amen
[1:27:58] sure if they agree with God's word go
[1:28:00] with it amen but if it's contrary to the
[1:28:02] word you've got to you got to identify
[1:28:04] it and withstand it amen amen see how
[1:28:09] God does things it's his business see
[1:28:11] Paul and Silas I was actually looking
[1:28:13] when was the first time they were ever
[1:28:14] in jail and the first time Paul was in
[1:28:17] jail was with Silas in Acts chapter 16
[1:28:20] you know and he was not just put in jail
[1:28:22] they put in the inner prison and they
[1:28:24] were beaten and they are in stocks and
[1:28:26] it says you know the Bible says and
[1:28:27] after they had laid many stripes upon
[1:28:29] them that means they beaten a lot not
[1:28:31] just one or two they they receive many
[1:28:33] stripes and what happens is the enemy
[1:28:36] will beat us he will trouble us in our
[1:28:38] minds he will he will bring trauma back
[1:28:41] up from our past and he'll make those
[1:28:43] things so real to us and they are right
[1:28:46] so that's what it's like to be beaten
[1:28:48] and they're not just and they just
[1:28:49] weren't just in prison they beaten and
[1:28:51] they placed in stocks so they couldn't
[1:28:54] walk like they wanted to walk amen I
[1:28:56] mean they were stuck in who's ever seen
[1:28:57] someone in
[1:28:59] stocks you're pinned man you ain't
[1:29:01] walking around you're stuck and this is
[1:29:04] what the enemy wants us to be like he
[1:29:05] wants us to be a prisoner in our own
[1:29:07] mind you'll find the thought pattern of
[1:29:10] the enemy is like a hamster wheel
[1:29:12] there's no conclusion it goes around and
[1:29:15] it goes around but remember God is a
[1:29:17] counselor a counselor brings you to a
[1:29:20] conclusion right it's not a constant
[1:29:22] thinking like a hamster wheel that's the
[1:29:25] devil's thought pattern yeah he doesn't
[1:29:27] want you to be free that's right I know
[1:29:30] that's not shocking that should be new
[1:29:31] to shouldn't be new to anyone he wants
[1:29:33] to keep you bound as a prisoner in your
[1:29:35] mind always thinking of the same old
[1:29:37] things again and again and again it's
[1:29:40] like it hens to but God will bring
[1:29:41] things to your remembrance but bring a
[1:29:43] conclusion bring a way of Escape bring a
[1:29:45] way to actually come out of those things
[1:29:47] amen that's right praise the Lord
[1:29:49] hallelujah amen it's like if you can't
[1:29:52] forgive someone the devil just keep you
[1:29:53] on the hamster well they did that and I
[1:29:55] can't believe they did this and he'll
[1:29:56] add to it right and they did this and
[1:29:58] this is why I feel this way but then God
[1:30:00] will say why can't you forgive them sure
[1:30:03] they did that to you but why can't you
[1:30:05] forgive them you want to be you want to
[1:30:07] be rid of this feeling forgive them give
[1:30:11] it over to me amen sure you still feel
[1:30:13] the hurt and the trauma but but let let
[1:30:15] me heal that from you Hallelujah but
[1:30:17] you've got to give it to me what is it
[1:30:19] he's counseling you you're not meant to
[1:30:21] hold the this pain you're not meant to
[1:30:22] hold this hurt you're not meant to hold
[1:30:24] this regret or this shame give it to me
[1:30:26] stop going on a hamster whe in your mind
[1:30:28] of Shame and pain and hurt in your past
[1:30:31] step
[1:30:32] off hamster wheel is not very wide the
[1:30:34] hamster just needs to step off and I
[1:30:36] think many times without thinking we
[1:30:37] just need to step off or how do you step
[1:30:39] off begin to think about the promises of
[1:30:41] God think about something else think of
[1:30:44] something that's got vert you it's
[1:30:46] actually got some goodness to
[1:30:48] it amen just like that you say well this
[1:30:51] person and this and my upbringing and
[1:30:53] all these things step off that hamster
[1:30:55] wheel you can't change the past none of
[1:30:57] us can change the past see but it's the
[1:30:59] enemy trying to get you to always focus
[1:31:01] on those things he wants to control
[1:31:03] control you but no God wants to set us
[1:31:06] free of those things so they are in a p
[1:31:07] you can be a prisoner in your mind you
[1:31:09] can be trapped in the same thinking your
[1:31:11] feet can be in stock so you can't walk
[1:31:13] with God like you really want to you
[1:31:15] can't seem to enjoy God at all well then
[1:31:18] what's the way out of the prison what
[1:31:20] the same way they got out of their
[1:31:21] prison oh yes amen see no doubt when
[1:31:24] they were in the prison there would have
[1:31:26] been a voice whispering in their ears
[1:31:28] it's all over now you're done this is it
[1:31:31] normally prison's the end you know but
[1:31:33] remember it ain't over until God says
[1:31:36] it's over amen so you may think there's
[1:31:38] no way out of this problem there's no
[1:31:39] way out of this complex there's no way
[1:31:40] out of this pain it ain't over till God
[1:31:42] says it's over amen amen you don't see
[1:31:45] just this is not your end praise the
[1:31:48] Lord we're going through these things
[1:31:50] that's right amen we're going to come
[1:31:51] out the other side better loving the
[1:31:52] Lord
[1:31:53] more amen so Paul and Silas they were in
[1:31:56] this condition what they do they begin
[1:31:58] to they prayed and they sang praises to
[1:32:01] God this is how they got out of this
[1:32:03] thing so the enemy wanted to come and
[1:32:04] say you're stuck here Paul this is the
[1:32:06] end of your journey this is the end of
[1:32:08] your life this is just how it's going to
[1:32:10] be but God didn't say it was over and
[1:32:13] they began to share testimonies one with
[1:32:15] another Hallelujah Paul went back to the
[1:32:18] road to Damascus silus I want to tell
[1:32:20] you one more time I was on that road I
[1:32:23] wanted to destroy you silus do you know
[1:32:25] if I knew you back then silus I would
[1:32:26] have Haled you into a prison like this I
[1:32:28] would have beaten you and I would have
[1:32:29] enjoyed it because I would have hated
[1:32:30] you but then God met me on the road to
[1:32:32] Damascus Silas and now all I can do is
[1:32:35] love you and I love him and he's
[1:32:36] wonderful and I'm so glad he's brought
[1:32:38] me out of this I'm so thankful that I'm
[1:32:40] a changed transformed new creation and
[1:32:43] then s said Paul you know what when you
[1:32:45] a pH you I would have admired you I
[1:32:47] wanted to be like you Hallelujah but one
[1:32:49] day God met me too that same God you met
[1:32:52] I met in a different way but he's the
[1:32:53] same God Amen he's transformed my life
[1:32:55] too Paul Silas aren't you glad aren't
[1:32:58] you glad for those moments yes Silas I'm
[1:33:00] so glad you know what Paul what Silas
[1:33:03] he's still the same amen we may be in a
[1:33:05] prison my back is covered and Stripes
[1:33:08] I'm in a lot of pain right now but I'm
[1:33:09] not going to focus on that Paul that's
[1:33:11] right Silas Hallelujah who cares what
[1:33:13] they can do to these bodies our souls
[1:33:14] are Eternal we're sealed away in the
[1:33:16] Rock of Ages we're been covered in the
[1:33:18] blood of Jesus Christ amen I'm on my way
[1:33:20] to canaan's F I'm on my way to Glory
[1:33:22] doesn't matter what the enemy can do
[1:33:24] that's right Paul you know what silus
[1:33:26] let's start praying let's start thanking
[1:33:27] God he's my God he's your God Amen we're
[1:33:30] two or three gathered in my name he's in
[1:33:32] the mid silus hey Paul there's two of us
[1:33:34] yes that's right Silas he's right here
[1:33:36] with us amen and they begin to pray and
[1:33:38] they begin to thank God Amen and the
[1:33:39] stripes didn't matter no more the stocks
[1:33:41] didn't matter no more and God came down
[1:33:43] and shook that prison amen the Yoke was
[1:33:46] broken because of the anointing
[1:33:48] Hallelujah and every prison door flew
[1:33:50] open and they got got out of that prison
[1:33:53] free hallelujah what they broke through
[1:33:55] in praise and prayer because they knew
[1:33:58] this is not their ought to be
[1:34:00] conditioned amen friends if we could
[1:34:02] take the same thing in the spiritual
[1:34:04] this morning I mean you may be going
[1:34:06] through something I'm not discounting
[1:34:07] what you're going through but don't let
[1:34:09] it be who you are I mean let God be your
[1:34:13] identity I'm a son or daughter of God
[1:34:15] Amen this thing is will not Define me
[1:34:18] this thing will not be who I am or known
[1:34:20] by I'll be known by the blood of Jesus
[1:34:23] Christ I'll be known by his holy ghost
[1:34:25] I'll be known by his transforming power
[1:34:27] that's my identity amen my his word is
[1:34:30] my identity this is who I am amen that's
[1:34:33] how we should be because if you identify
[1:34:36] yourself that way the enemy might try
[1:34:37] and come and control you you say Satan
[1:34:39] get away from me in the name of Jesus
[1:34:41] Christ You' have come to steal kill and
[1:34:43] destroy but my God has come to give me
[1:34:45] love courage and ability Hallelujah and
[1:34:47] I am going to walk out of here rejoicing
[1:34:49] and praising God I mean because the
[1:34:52] anointing breaks the Yoke I mean so if
[1:34:54] we could just really think you think
[1:34:56] about it you know hallelujah our
[1:35:00] god is the all powerful one but Satan
[1:35:05] has only as much power as you give him
[1:35:08] so he can be a very big giant if you
[1:35:11] allow him to be a big giant you can let
[1:35:13] that fear be a massive thing that
[1:35:14] cripples your whole life or it can just
[1:35:16] be an
[1:35:17] annoyance and actually or it can just be
[1:35:19] a trophy on the wall of God's
[1:35:21] power CU you're delivered so the enemy
[1:35:24] is only as big as you allow him to be
[1:35:27] because the scripture says neither give
[1:35:28] place to the devil am me the enemy can
[1:35:31] be very big or he can be very small it's
[1:35:34] up to you brother Bram says in the
[1:35:37] message the Oneness of unity now when
[1:35:39] the meeting's going on an evil spirit in
[1:35:41] the meeting that spirit is almost
[1:35:44] harmless until it can catch somebody
[1:35:47] that it can work through then when it
[1:35:49] can work through it'll certainly do
[1:35:51] damage because it is a evil
[1:35:54] spirit so an evil spirit in a meeting is
[1:35:58] almost harmless until it can catch
[1:36:00] somebody to work through that's right oh
[1:36:03] the devil's on the Rampage but he's
[1:36:04] almost harmless until he can find
[1:36:07] somebody to work through I want to be
[1:36:09] the first one to say he can't work
[1:36:11] through me I'm covered in the blood of
[1:36:13] Jesus Christ he can't cause any damage
[1:36:15] through me amen and it's the same with
[1:36:18] the Holy Spirit he is here am mean
[1:36:20] trying to find somebody to work through
[1:36:23] and when it finds somebody to work
[1:36:25] through it can do good see the two
[1:36:28] Spirits their motives their objective
[1:36:30] watch how it is watch their Works watch
[1:36:32] their fruits then you can see what
[1:36:34] spirit is on you you're motivated by a
[1:36:36] spirit if you have no Spirit you're dead
[1:36:39] and if you have a spirit it motivates
[1:36:40] your life so what spirit is motivating
[1:36:43] you is it fear and doubt that's not God
[1:36:47] you have a right to deny that thing in
[1:36:49] the name of Jesus Christ you don't have
[1:36:50] to live under that this is an hour of
[1:36:52] Liberty amen this is an hour of total
[1:36:53] Jubilee a total Liberty for the children
[1:36:55] of God Amen that we can walk under the
[1:36:57] anointing of the Holy Ghost and not
[1:36:59] under the bondage of the of of the devil
[1:37:02] amen so the devil is almost harmless
[1:37:04] until he can find somebody to work
[1:37:06] through so we don't need to fear the
