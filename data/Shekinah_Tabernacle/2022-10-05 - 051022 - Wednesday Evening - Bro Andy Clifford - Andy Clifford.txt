are punctual Hallelujah because we want to give God some time at the end amen amen we don't want to exhaust the physical resource and then have no prayer time but amen I believe that God is going to move tonight Hallelujah he's already moving but I believe that he's going to move some more amen because people are here and they want him to move and they're calling on his name and he said If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and gather together and we're doing that tonight Who's humbled themselves who's gathered together and who's called by his name amen Mrs Jesus Christ oh we're together again amen well there is nothing impossible tonight everyone can leave this place completely healed from all infirmities spiritual physical anything else that's ailing you or anything hola whatever you need make it known tonight hallelujah amen okay amen let's just uh turn on our Bibles too um uh oh my let me just get these notes back up here okay Hebrews chapter 11. amen Hallelujah uh sorry Tech Team I didn't tell you the name but the name of this was called The Spoils of War hallelujah oh my Lord the Lord is so good amen hallelujah one day I could preach the full the full sermon on this but we're just going to touch on a couple of things amen hallelujah and the subject is you know the Lord is building your anointing and your Victory through suffering and through the challenges that we face and the experiences that he allows us to go through Hallelujah so let's read from Hebrews chapter 11 amen and when we're reading this I want you to realize that this is your family history this is your family tree this is your stock that you come from this is our predecessors hallelujah we're reading about our family who are waiting for us who are cheering us on who have got faith in the God that was inside of us that is saying come okay I'm gonna get hit myself okay amen let's read from verses 32 amen down to 40 and it says here and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jephthah of David also and Samuel and of the prophets yeah who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions Hallelujah this is your family now and I believe he's the same today and these things is our own testimonies amen who believes that tonight quench the violence of fire Glory escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wex Valiant and fight and I love this one turned to flight the armies of the aliens Hallelujah your enemy is scared of you Hallelujah if you believe in your God and our God your enemy is scared of you and hordes of demons will flee from you the moment you even think about praying demons are scattering Hallelujah because they're afraid oh my oh my woman received their dead rise to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgeons yay moreover of bands and imprisonment Hallelujah you're with me they were stoned they were sworn in half or asunder and half is easier for the children were tempted we're slaying with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy oh my that's one of the most powerful statements of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all glory having obtained a good report through faith who's thankful for Faith tonight that through faith you can obtain a good report amen hallelujah through faith amen it received not the oh sorry and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us hallelujah that they without us should not be made perfect now we're talking about they right and I'm going to carry on reading in verse and from 12 because Paul just carries on they someone separated that but this is the same paragraph wherefore seeing we also Glory are a compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses oh boy do you realize that there's a great cloud of witnesses these are this is your family behind you they're not somewhere too far off the prophet said they're just above amen they're just around hallelujah amen and they what they did before us the same God is here tonight to do the same things and we're going to pray tonight and great things are going to take place hallelujah amen amen amen uh you can have your seats I'll just keep reading because there's quite a lot of reading actually so I'll just carry on so it says here amen and wherefore scene we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily and I just want to underline that easily the Bible says it I don't really like to admit that but it is a thing that can happen very easily and so you must be vigilant amen and keep your eyes on Jesus amen hallelujah keep your eyes on him and stay in fellowship with him because he is the answer to everything he's the answer to our protection he's the answer to our walk he's the answer to success in our spirituality he's the answer to our mental well-being he's the answer to peace within our heart for those whose Minds have stayed on him are kept in perfect peace that's not just any peace now that's the peace that Jesus gives amen hallelujah amen so it says here which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and I know I say this every time but I want to say it again that word race is not just something that you're going out there and running even though it's figurative the word race is the battle so there is a battle that is set before every one of you there is an ordained predestined battle full of Trials full of valleys full of mountains full of suffering and full of Glory for you and in that and this is where we're going to get to our text in that suffering in those battles in those victories is The Spoils of War and every time you conquer an enemy and take land you will receive spoils you will receive riches you will receive Treasures you will receive anointings you will receive power you will receive glory and it's already in you it just needs to be taken back from the enemy are you with me Hallelujah and so I want to incite you to war tonight I want to incite you you are a 24 7 devil so don't be a 23 7 Christian Hallelujah be a 24 7 believer a 24 second fighter right but let me talk to you about how you fight this is how I my battles this is how I fight my battles it may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by you when he comes that is our Victory not what we can do but what he does and he loves to come he loves to step on the scene and change your situation he loves to come down when you're in distress and rescue you from whatever trouble you may be facing not Glory amen Laurie that was the foundation amen Laurie Hallelujah where do we get to looking unto Jesus I just love that the race that is set before us it is set before you whether you accept it or not you have it's all ordained amen so I encourage you in this whole array it's all set Just Surrender yourself amen your mind surrender yourself to God he's got it all planned out he's got it already and he'll just allow you to go through it don't tamper with it no temple with the evidence don't tamper with it don't try and run off the path or run this way that way just submit to God Amen Let Him lead you let him take the reign of your heart amen second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10. Hallelujah therefore I take pleasure in infirmities hey man this is Paul speaking again oh sorry I need to just carry on I just skipped about 10 verses out of Hebrews 12. looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be worried and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son and my daughter but son is a double it means both despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor fate when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth every son can you say every son every daughter everyone no one's exempt there is a scorching to take place there's a scouring out to take place there are challenges to take place there is a resurrection to take place but there's also a death there's also a suffering there's also the valleys but in these desert places righteous men are molded into Saints and so these things we must go through Hallelujah but through it all and as you Traverse through these challenges and through these things God will bring you through and you will come out in Victory and you will come out with spoils you'll come out with spoils I mean you'll come out with booty that's what the other word is for spoils which is treasures and those Treasures are not just like physical Golds and things like that but they're actually characteristics it's the characteristics of this divine nature it's your conscience back it's your reasoning back you know sometimes you get into a place where you can't reason properly and people will look on you and they'll think why are you how can you not why are you thinking like that why are you thinking that but the devil stole your reasoning and now it's time for you to take it back if someone's lost their reasoning take it back tonight if someone's lost their conscience because you stared at the wrong thing take it back tonight the Divine healer is here he can heal your hand and he can heal your conscience because your spirit needs healing sometimes in all of us we have these things that happen in our lives for a reason because the Lord wants to come down into your battle and show you just how good he is how powerful he is and how much he can come and heal you amen and heal your family amen for consider oh sorry if you enjoy chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth what second Corinthians 12 10 it says therefore I take pleasure and infirmities wow that's a pretty big statement no one really wants to take pleasure in sickness and weakness and reproaches this is Paul now he's saying I'm I'm actually taking pleasure and reproaches and necessities and now that weren't Necessities there is a very interesting uh thought there because you know God brings us to a place where we need Deliverance God brings us to a place where we need him we get into Corners sometimes where there's no other way but God has anyone been there has anyone been in a place where it's the only way out is up oh yeah you know if you haven't been there it's coming Hallelujah you just let God live Hallelujah because God wants to bring you out of those situations he wants to bring you out of those things where the devil's stolen something from you he wants to bring you out of a situation where you cannot do it Hallelujah because he wants to bring that treasure into your life because you see that's a devil squatting on your land oh man when you know that there's a devil squatting on your inheritance he's got an expiry date he's got his comings amen who believes that Hallelujah amen and until you take that portion of your inheritance you can't till the soil you can't use it there cannot be fruit on that part of your life but when you take it this is The Spoils of War tonight when you take that part of your land it becomes yours forever because you will never let the devil take that back hello because you will take that and defend that and walk in there and wage war amen hallelujah God acting on your behalf Glory Hallelujah I take pleasure in reproaches and necessities Hallelujah and persecution you know this necessities I just want to stop on that a little bit how long have we got my halfway so necessities you see the devil is very good at meeting all of our needs if you don't I I you probably already know this but he has a very big free of knowledge and as bows his branches just extend the Earth the Bible describes him as a giant tree and all the kings and everyone just is eating his fruit and just relishing under him the whole economy everything of this world is just it's just relishing under this great tree of knowledge and we happen to have a big portion of that in our own lives when we participate in the monetary system and go to jobs and go to work and we participate in planting our potatoes and you know we go home and you turn the key of your car all of those things is meeting a need that you have and these little soft things in your pillow and your blankets and your electric blanket amen and all those things that you have those Comforts those Creature Comforts they're just meeting your needs they're comforting you and many times they're lullabying you to sleep but it's time to wake him yeah it's time my little bride's awaken from sleep and waking up and realize that these things is just a decoration but just beyond that Hallelujah is the truth of the matter and so as the prophet says that and there will come a time where the discernment and the bride will discern the Antichrist Spirit it will discern it all and he will become powerless against you and all of this veneer and all the things of this world all the Comforts and all those things will lose their attraction in your life and you will begin to break through and you will begin to walk with God Amen among and above it all amen amen hallelujah amen therefore I take pleasure and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong hallelujah amen the prophet says this and um the church ages he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is effective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how do shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that as he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons amen who's been placed tonight who's had God work in their life tonight who's seen his hand in their life has he begun something in you amen if he's begun something in you he will carry it through amen Philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you shall continue it unto the day of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so he's brought you out of Egypt out of Darkness into himself Amen to give you life and to give you light and to change your nature to make you ready for the Rapture amen Hallelujah and this is here and gave us a spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him that's a good question and the prophet says by believing what he said amen amen and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass I love that Hallelujah Hallelujah may the Lord help me I need a two I need an intercooler up here you know it's so hot you see no matter how hard it gets how tough it gets how you know the the Lord will not put you through something that you cannot handle amen he will not take you take you above something that will crush you down until you're nothing he will always allow these things to happen and the devil is on a leash tonight amen the devil has got an ex he's got only a little he can only go this far and no further and so the things that you are going through is controlled but just remember this Hallelujah when you begin to engage with God and when God begins to work in your life amen when he begins to engage with you and and you get serious with God who serious was God tonight amen if you're serious with God God wants to get into the very center of your life he wants to come down into every door of your heart he wants to come down into the deepest parts of your life so that he can change those sins so I just encourage you just open it all up amen he wants to build your house he wants to build the divine nature in you as we heard on Sunday he wants to build that your spirit egg he wants you to have a good conscience he wants you to have clean affections he wants you to have good imaginations he wants you to remember him in your memory amen hallelujah he wants you to have clear reasonings and be able to think properly so it's time as he starts building your house and I want to just visit because you the the story of Ezra you know when they they that Cyrus you know the the king of uh the medes and Persians at the time it starts off with him getting a dream and the Lord visits him and says I want my house built Hallelujah they'd been in Babylon they and so they had been struggling under the the regime of Babylon and then Persian Empire but then the Lord says I want my house built and so he gives Cyrus this burden and he and he and Cyrus brought forth a decree that and he says go and build the house and whatever you need and he gives us out everything that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple to restore The Spoils of War to restore everything back that the devil had taken and so he was saying I want my house built again and so a people came together under the decree of the king to rebuild the house you see though whenever you try to do something for God the devil is right there to try and stop it but I want to encourage you never give up never stop fighting never stop building just continue on no matter how hard it gets no matter how hopeless it seems no matter how much you fail just take a sword in one hand and take the Bible in the other hand and take your tools and continue on continue building continue fighting continue pressing forward no matter what Hallelujah the devil came against us around the people he got those people together and he started rallying in the political realm started rallying against them started putting letters to the king and he swatted them and they got discouraged and it stopped for a little while and sometimes you find yourself in a situation where you're so beaten down and you have and you feel and you realize that that thing that God did in my life that Glory that Revival that I had those that first love that I had that's gone where's it gone let's just stop for a little while maybe you got this courage maybe the enemy came in he saw that you were building he saw that God was doing something in your life and then he began to attack you and he begins to go before our King and say let me tempt them and God saw confidence in his salvation in you to allow you to go through something where you would end up in a valley and it's all stop seemingly but remember there's a purpose God wants to get victory over that enemy in your life God wants you to receive Spoils of all God wants you to gain land he wants to build your house and so you see then they said no you know what we're going to rise up and they win and they petition and then the king Darius he begin and he went and searched the the books and searched the records and he and he found that it had been decreed and so what he did and I want to tell you that when you don't give up then when you just have a a true faith in you and you never just let it go even if you find that you've been ground down to a stump has anyone ever been ground down to a stump where you just feel like it's all been round off and you're just completely broken but then God begins to come on the scene and he begins to issue and eat it from Darius he begins to issue and say you know what those enemies they wrote those letters I'm gonna make them help you Hallelujah I'm gonna make those enemies you know what they did King Darius he actually got the ones that were talking and complaining and making it hard for them and he made them pay to build the temple you know that he said all the taxes that you guys get all the stuff and the tributes that will normally come to me I want you guys to pay Jerusalem I want you guys to pay Ezra I want you guys to pay those people so that they can build the temple I want you guys to supply all the wood yeah so that they can build I never give up no matter how hard it seems no matter how far you may have gone no matter how trouble it might fight just remember God has not giving up on you God is behind you he's beneath you he's within you and he's gonna rise up from him and then you just fight amen just fight and remember that the temple get built yeah yep it got built hey man Hallelujah and my prayer tonight is Lord continue building my Tabernacle Build Me Lord was it vulcanized I like that word vulcanize me Lord who wants to be vulcanized who wants all those attributes joined together people just separated off in some idea in your mind but vulcanized by Revelation vulcanized by fire you know what you can have all those things mixed together in your mind and it's a good Doctrine and then the fire comes and melts it all together oh tonight Saints we're about to have a prayer meeting this ain't gonna be no usual prayer meeting Hallelujah hey man because not because of me nothing I said ain't not much of a Preacher at all I just say a lot of things but God and you yeah okay we're nearly there amen that was my five minute warning whoa yes amen the fire or drawing it together the fire will bring it together not just bring it together but the fire will also burn off all the other things let me tell you one more story because you see the people that the treasures and spoils that they got was they got their enemy to basically support and help them and you know what the devil does you know what the Lord has made the devil do made you get stronger made you get strong higher made your character develop amen amen so that's all he can do you may think it's hard and it's not easy when you're going through it but remember the victory is there and the spoils are sure the spoils are certain you know when Jehoshaphat got into trouble in the ammonites and the mobites all came to on them you know what they did they just prayed they just got down and got serious with God and he prophesied and he said I'm gonna just step on the scene you know what it took them three days to get all the spoils out that's right Hallelujah when God comes on the scene to vulcanize the situation and he vulcanized it all together and he came on he spoke and he did it yeah and see my salvation God wants you to stand still tonight when we pray and see his salvation do you remember they got the spoils oh my they got so many spoils and do you know what when you stand still and you seek God's salvation and the enemy might have taken your land maybe the enemy's taking your sons maybe the enemy's taking your daughters maybe the enemy's taking your freedom taking your Victory but just take it back tonight take them back tonight amen but you see the trials that you go through the the absolute pain the turmoil the heart-wrenching moments and nights of of sleepless nights because of of tragic things that happen just remember the race is set before you amen it's ordained God wants to put Treasures in you he wants to take the treasures out of the soil of your heart because you see it's all in the in a potential but until you go through something until you have a necessity in your life until there's a trial so deep Hallelujah that's so close to your heart that you there's just no other way out what's going to happen and when someone's hating on you and you for no reason and you love them and they hate on you and they can't you can't break through but then God comes what is it God is releasing in your life something for your ministry God is releasing something in your life for your song playing for your song leading for your worship leading for your drum play for whatever he has got and he's called you your trials will raise the treasures out of your Earth amen you know that your trials the things you go through Hallelujah let's say you get challenged deeply and and let's say you know you get away with son and the wayward son like the prodigal father and the trials were so deep upon him but that prodigal father when he got his son back he got Victory he got redeeming love flying out of his life because you see redeeming love must flow through him to a son Hallelujah and when your children leave or whether you struggle with relationships or friendships or whatever it may be let redeeming love flow out of your spirit let it flow from you just yield to God and in the trial God will come and he will love and it will Salvage you from your own trials and you will have Victory and you will get The Spoils of War it'll take days to take those spoils out of your enemies hands Hallelujah tonight I encourage you take some spoils tonight as we pray musicians can come Hallelujah as we pray I want you to take spoiled I want you to remember your enemies that you face right now because there's everyone in here is facing something everyone's facing an enemy everyone's facing some giant or facing some hardship facing hurt facing something that's challenging them people to hate them or resentment or gossip about them or whatever it may be I want you to face the enemy and pray and pray through and allow God Jehoshaphat pray God came on the scene Israel Nehemiah they all prayed and God came on the scene nothing happens easily nothing just falls out like that the devil's always going to chase and the Lord will allow him to bring you to a place where you can get victory over him because really that enemy is spotting on your land who wants the enemy off their land who wants just to give him a good beating tonight Hallelujah remember when the weakest of Christian gets on their knees hell shaking Hallelujah can we sing this is how I fight my battles I don't know if there is an option is there a faster version not fast fast but like if there's a scale of speed just on the on the bouncy side Hallelujah everyone says well not everyone but a lot of us say you know they have problems with the keys well I don't have problem with the keys I got a problem with the the Rhythm just play that song sweetly for now I just want to read one more thing Hallelujah do you believe God's still God Ben do you believe God's still God I know God was God as God comes into my life he comes into my prayer room does he come into your prayer room Hallelujah you know he loves that God loves that he wants to be God in your life if there's anyone in here who doesn't know God as God I encourage you tonight wherever you're at maybe you're far from him but tonight face your situation like your host of fat face your fire like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they had a government pressure over them the government the king of Babylon was pressuring them to worship idols and to go off into a into his worship of the golden statue they had a national pressure against them they had demons over the nation over them and you know what the same these demons over New Zealand are going to come and try and come over us too you know that they always try that but you see God wants to give you victory over those things God wants to give you victory over the Kiwi Spirit God
