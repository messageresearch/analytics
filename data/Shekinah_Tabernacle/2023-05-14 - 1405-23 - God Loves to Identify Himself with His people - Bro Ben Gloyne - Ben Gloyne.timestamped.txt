[8:04] welcome to the house of God this morning
[8:06] [Music]
[8:09] we're good okay there we go it's good to
[8:12] be here it's good to see you all
[8:16] um you feeling good
[8:19] feeling ready to praise the Lord feeling
[8:22] happy for what the Lord's done for you
[8:24] feeling happy that you're a winner
[8:27] when when
[8:29] when we commit our life to the Lord we
[8:31] win everything we win the game of Life
[8:32] we've won there's nothing there's no
[8:35] other prize that we need to win after
[8:36] that we're done
[8:38] we're done so hey it's Mother's Day
[8:40] today
[8:43] happy Mother's Day to all the mothers
[8:46] [Applause]
[8:52] we wouldn't be here without our mothers
[8:55] [Music]
[8:57] if everyone has a mother if you're here
[8:58] you've got a mother and um you know it's
[9:01] the one thing that's under a lot of
[9:03] attack
[9:05] besides anything else that's good but
[9:07] it's such a good thing that it's under
[9:09] so much attack motherhood in this day
[9:11] and age but I thank God that there are
[9:13] still
[9:14] godly woman that decide to be a mother
[9:18] and and and
[9:19] commit their actually give their life
[9:23] over to that cause because it takes a
[9:24] majority of a woman's life you know and
[9:28] they've got the honor in them to give
[9:30] their life over to that cause to raise
[9:32] the Next Generation to be Godly sons and
[9:34] godly daughters
[9:36] and if that if you take that away you'll
[9:38] find the world is going to become a
[9:39] different place because it's been taken
[9:40] away but we thank God that that in
[9:42] amongst all this mess there are still
[9:44] mothers that take on that role seriously
[9:46] and stand up and and do that so we think
[9:50] God for that
[9:52] I'm going to say hi to my bro Joel
[9:54] he's uh not here but he's on the
[9:58] um
[9:58] the streaming today I told him I gave
[10:01] him the login
[10:03] that he whip the YouTube page and he's
[10:06] going to be listening I don't know if
[10:07] you know the testimony he's actually
[10:09] staying at the
[10:10] Factory at the moment he was um
[10:14] I'll just hear this I thought it was
[10:16] quite nice he was he's been in prison
[10:18] for about three months on any we were
[10:20] applying to get electronic monitoring
[10:23] bail for him but it's nice to have your
[10:26] own space so I applied to get him
[10:29] away from the from Hamilton where he
[10:31] isn't and down here and to set up a room
[10:33] at the factory and have him
[10:35] be approved to get his bail at the
[10:37] factory and he has a bracelet on there
[10:39] and
[10:39] um it wasn't looking that hopeful and we
[10:42] had to have the parole officers had to
[10:44] come and check out the premises and um
[10:47] when these guys went there it was nice
[10:50] guys that um they were I think they were
[10:52] Samoan one one old guy one younger guy
[10:53] these are the guys that run the um
[10:56] um
[10:57] probation office which is down the road
[10:59] they came in and um
[11:02] our Factory we're doing a lot of
[11:04] Renovations there and it was a complete
[11:05] and utter mess when these guys came in
[11:07] and they have to approve as Joel can
[11:10] Joel come and stay here and and this our
[11:12] Factory is honestly an utter disaster
[11:15] like it's like a bomb site at the moment
[11:17] it's clean now but and so these guys
[11:20] walked in and they they look around and
[11:21] they say
[11:22] oh so uh where's he gonna live
[11:29] and I couldn't even get to the room to
[11:31] show him where the room was I'd set up a
[11:33] little room there was all the stuff in
[11:34] front of it and plus the room was filled
[11:36] with junk anyway
[11:37] and I can just see these guys talking
[11:40] amongst themselves saying man this we're
[11:41] not going to approve this place man this
[11:43] sort of going
[11:44] um where's the facilities like the
[11:46] toilet net you know I said us it's over
[11:49] the back there and we had to cross
[11:52] climb and stumble over stuff to get to
[11:55] the back and
[11:56] and um I didn't
[11:58] yeah then that was that was a mess
[11:59] because I'd done some work on the on the
[12:01] roof of that the ceiling of that place
[12:02] that I hadn't cleaned underneath it
[12:04] there's all this sawdust and stuff in
[12:06] the toilet area and um I was trying hard
[12:09] to convince them that they should let
[12:11] Joel come and stay here stay there but
[12:12] it wasn't looking good I'm saying no
[12:14] it's going to be good man I'll look
[12:15] after him well we've never done this
[12:16] before
[12:18] [Music]
[12:19] and and um
[12:22] then we walked past Brother Andy
[12:24] because he was there at the time and I
[12:26] had to walk around and show them another
[12:27] spot
[12:28] and I'm I'm trying to sort of make light
[12:30] of the situation so I say oh
[12:33] this is Andy
[12:35] I said something like oh he'll get on
[12:37] with Joel he's a criminal
[12:39] and I realized what I said I'm like oh
[12:42] no they're going to think like we've got
[12:43] criminals here and they're going to be
[12:44] putting Joel into a place where there's
[12:45] criminals and I said I'd say so I'm
[12:47] trying to make a joke and I think man
[12:48] I've got to correct myself I say uh uh X
[12:50] criminal I mean
[12:52] and then Andy says yeah I was until I
[12:55] found until I met Jesus
[12:58] and then these guys say they stop and
[13:00] they say oh
[13:02] do you know Jesus
[13:04] and then he says yeah I know Jesus and
[13:06] so they proceeded to ask us a whole
[13:08] bunch of questions about uh the first
[13:10] they sell are you born again yeah
[13:13] and are you gonna take Joel to church
[13:16] yeah does he want to go to church yep
[13:19] yep he looked at his buddy and he says
[13:21] that's all the questions we need we
[13:24] approve so
[13:29] it it turns out that both these guys
[13:31] were pastors of churches so so they said
[13:35] that's the important questions we've
[13:37] asked you the important questions we
[13:39] have proved that he can live here in
[13:40] this
[13:41] mess
[13:42] so but they are there so we're under
[13:45] government orders to we must take Joel
[13:47] to church though once he applies to get
[13:49] his his he can get leave to come here
[13:51] um
[13:52] so it's government orders that we must
[13:54] bring him to church
[13:55] because they approved it on the basis
[13:57] we're going to take them to church the
[14:00] first time I've heard the government say
[14:01] that
[14:02] praise the Lord so

[47:33] we're going to go to
[47:34] um
[47:35] I'm going to go to the book of Isaiah
[47:37] this morning I'm going to read a couple
[47:38] of places here
[47:39] I got a few things on slideshow just to
[47:43] um
[47:43] yeah I mean praise the Lord I thought uh
[47:46] Stephanie and Hannah's um uh special is
[47:49] very applicable because I want to talk
[47:50] about when God God loves to see himself
[47:52] in you then he manifests himself so I
[47:54] thought that's real you know Hallelujah
[47:57] I thought that was very uh timely and
[47:58] yes it was a blessing so amen so we're
[48:01] here in Isaiah 55 just bear with me I'm
[48:03] still you know the devil's left you know
[48:06] I'm I'm recovering but you know the
[48:08] devil's lazy he never takes his bags so
[48:10] so a few things that are going away you
[48:13] know but praise a lot
[48:15] um Isaiah 55 and from verse 7
[48:18] down to verse 11 then we're going to go
[48:19] to Second Kings it says let the wicked
[48:22] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[48:24] has thoughts and let him return unto the
[48:26] Lord and he'll have mercy upon him
[48:29] and to our God for he will abundantly
[48:32] pardon for my thoughts are not your
[48:34] thoughts neither are my uh your ways my
[48:37] way saith the Lord for as the heavens
[48:39] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[48:41] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[48:43] than your thoughts for as the rain
[48:45] cometh down in the snow from heaven and
[48:47] returneth not hither but watereth the
[48:49] Earth and maketh that bring forth and
[48:51] Bud that it may give seed to the sower
[48:53] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[48:56] that goth forth out of my mouth it shall
[48:59] not return unto me void but it shall
[49:01] accomplish that which I please and it
[49:04] shall prosper in the thing we're in two
[49:06] I sent it I mean it's whatever God spoke
[49:08] it's going to happen doesn't matter the
[49:10] difficulty while the devil throws in its
[49:12] way it's going to produce exactly what
[49:14] it says it's going to produce I mean
[49:16] take that devil right now amen
[49:19] Hallelujah and then we're going to go to
[49:20] Second Kings bit of a uh yeah a bit of a
[49:23] background here we're gonna go through
[49:25] for a few illustrations but you're just
[49:27] going to read here then Elisha this is
[49:29] when Samaria is shut up by the syrians
[49:31] they're besieged and they're got to such
[49:33] a desperate spot they're basically
[49:35] eating each other's children the bark
[49:37] off the trees all the grass is gone and
[49:39] you know and and then and then and then
[49:41] Elisha said he the word of the Lord thus
[49:43] saith the Lord tomorrow about this time
[49:45] shall a measure of fine flower be sold
[49:48] for a shekel and two measures of barley
[49:50] for a shekel in the gate of Samaria then
[49:52] then a lord on Whose hand the king
[49:54] leaned answered the man of God said
[49:56] behold if the Lord would make the
[49:58] windows in heaven might this make
[50:01] Windows in heaven might this thing be
[50:02] and he said behold thou shall see it
[50:05] with thine eyes but thou shall not eat
[50:07] thereof so so this guy doubted got
[50:08] killed remember we're going to read that
[50:10] part but if you keep reading down and
[50:12] there were four leprous men at the
[50:13] entering and of the gate and they said
[50:15] one to another why sit we hear until we
[50:18] die if we say We'll enter into the city
[50:21] than the famines in the city and we
[50:23] shall die there and if we sit still here
[50:25] we die also now
[50:27] um therefore come let us lay and let us
[50:30] fall into the host of the syrians if
[50:33] they save us alive we shall live but if
[50:35] they kill us well but we shall but die
[50:38] and they rose up in the Twilight and go
[50:41] unto the camp of the syrians and when
[50:43] they had come to the uttermost part of
[50:44] the campus of Syria behold there's no
[50:46] man there for the Lord had made the host
[50:48] of syrians to hear a noise of Chariots
[50:50] and a noise of horses even the noise of
[50:53] a great host and they said one to
[50:55] another Lo the king of Israel hath hired
[50:57] against us the King Kings the Hittites
[50:59] and the kings of the Egyptians to come
[51:01] upon us
[51:02] wherefore they rose up and fled in the
[51:04] Twilight and left their tents and their
[51:06] horses and their asses even the camp as
[51:09] it was and fled for their life amen
[51:11] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[51:13] this morning amen gracious father we're
[51:16] so thankful we could look back at every
[51:17] day and say there you were and we're so
[51:19] thankful Lord You're the same yesterday
[51:21] today and forever Lord as you were back
[51:23] then so you are right now this morning
[51:25] so dear God we want to ask Lord to read
[51:28] your blessed word may you now anoint it
[51:30] to speaker and hear a lord may you touch
[51:32] our hearts and change them like only you
[51:34] can Lord we commit Our Lives into your
[51:36] hands Lord pray you just receive all
[51:37] honor glory and praise Lord from this
[51:39] service Grant it law we ask in Jesus
[51:41] Christ's name amen amen you may have
[51:44] your seats this morning amen so I want
[51:46] to talk about the lord loves to see
[51:47] himself in you and then he manifests
[51:49] himself so we read here in the beginning
[51:51] where where the Lord said I will not you
[51:53] know my word will not return unto me
[51:55] void so it's going to accomplish that
[51:57] exactly what she sent it now in the
[51:59] beginning we understand God spoke you
[52:01] know he created everything that we can
[52:03] see the universe and you know even as
[52:05] man has put up the James Wood telescope
[52:07] and seeing further than he's ever seen
[52:08] before and all that all that man can see
[52:10] and the Unseen World God made by his
[52:13] word but the thing is he had to have
[52:15] faith in the thing he spoke you know so
[52:17] so he so he said let there be but then
[52:19] he believed his own word and and that's
[52:22] what it was so when he said let there be
[52:24] sun moon and stars what he thought about
[52:25] in his mind it was a thought that it
[52:27] became a word and it was spoken then it
[52:30] became material because he believed in
[52:32] what he was speaking now God loves to so
[52:35] so so so God had to one speak the word
[52:37] but then believe the word but then what
[52:39] he does is he puts man upon the Earth
[52:41] and he puts that same faith that he had
[52:43] to believe his own word puts it in you
[52:45] and then he speaks his word and that
[52:46] faith in you says I believe that and it
[52:48] comes to pass and Mr God loves to see it
[52:51] when when when there's a faith in a
[52:53] people you know it's amazing what a
[52:54] confession of the word being right can
[52:56] unleash in your life you know as brother
[52:58] Branham was telling the testimony of the
[53:00] squirrels being spoken into existence
[53:02] and sister Hattie Wright was sitting
[53:04] there at her home she had two Wayward
[53:05] boys she you know was living on a farm
[53:07] she was a widow she had trouble your old
[53:09] parents and sister in a wheelchair and
[53:11] brother Brown was testifying of of the
[53:14] squirrels being created and some people
[53:16] were doubting that it had never been
[53:17] done before in the history of man of a
[53:19] man with creative power would Speak Life
[53:21] and then shoot that life then eat that
[53:23] life
[53:23] right because it because you know a
[53:25] vision doesn't bleed but a real squirrel
[53:27] does bleed because they didn't just he
[53:30] didn't just speak the squirrel he shot
[53:31] the squirrel then ate the squirrels
[53:32] right so so now remember a testimony is
[53:35] the word made manifest right so by his
[53:38] stripes we're healed then you someone
[53:39] stand up says well I believe him and he
[53:41] healed me and here I am so what is it
[53:43] it's the word made flesh that's what a
[53:45] testimony is so how do you write begin
[53:48] to believe see it was spoken right God
[53:50] spoke something through the prophet and
[53:52] then there was faith in the inside of
[53:54] that believer and she said there's
[53:55] nothing but the truth brother Burnham
[53:57] and he said that released a super
[53:59] anointing into the room and then God
[54:01] said to the prophet ask her what she
[54:03] wants and she'll have exactly whatever
[54:05] she wants she'll have it so it's so
[54:07] important that we see God loves to God
[54:09] can identify himself with a person that
[54:12] says I believe your word Lord I believe
[54:14] exactly what you've spoken I believe
[54:15] exactly what you meant by it God says I
[54:18] can identify myself with that kind of
[54:20] person Hallelujah so that's what I'm
[54:22] really going to really this morning is
[54:23] God God you know he'll only identify
[54:27] himself with certain people
[54:29] you can be all you can you can live the
[54:31] message through the letter
[54:33] but have a pride stubborn heart God
[54:35] won't anoint that life right but God
[54:37] anoints a hungry sincere surrendered
[54:40] heart I mean that's the kind of person
[54:42] he can identify himself with
[54:45] and I trust that's your heart's desire
[54:48] say Lord I want to see you live I don't
[54:50] want to fill my head with a bunch of
[54:52] quotes and scriptures only I wanted to
[54:54] anchor down into my heart that you can
[54:55] come anoint that word in my life that
[54:57] it's no longer just quotes and an
[54:59] argument and an idea and a lifestyle but
[55:01] it's a living God puts on flesh amen
[55:04] that's what I want in my life I want to
[55:06] see him live more and more I deserve I'm
[55:09] so moved this week say Lord we can come
[55:11] into your presence
[55:13] do you know how a place we are I'm not
[55:15] just talking about for a church coming
[55:16] to church no we can come into His
[55:18] presence every day that he actually
[55:20] desired see he put a faith in your life
[55:23] amen that when he spoke your word
[55:24] something and you said I believe that
[55:26] word
[55:27] hallelujah we're blessed friends we're
[55:29] very blessed people
[55:31] to step into the presence of God Amen
[55:34] and dwell in his presence forever
[55:37] Hallelujah so he put a faith in us amen
[55:40] that we could believe that no
[55:42] see God is not a man
[55:46] God is not a man that he should lie
[55:48] neither the son of man that should
[55:49] repent me and brother and Paul were
[55:50] talking about this I thought it was so
[55:51] good hath he said and shall he not do it
[55:54] or have he spoken and shall he not make
[55:56] it good amen so there's something in The
[55:58] Believer now it doesn't matter what
[55:59] state we're in because you know we're
[56:01] reading about four lepers there in the
[56:02] Bible they didn't realize they were the
[56:04] answer they were going to be the ones
[56:06] that were going to fulfill or cause the
[56:08] prophecy Elisha just prophesied to come
[56:10] to pass it wasn't the king's offices it
[56:12] wasn't the king himself it wasn't the
[56:14] dignitaries in Samaria it was the lepers
[56:16] on the outside of the gate that didn't
[56:18] even hear the prophecy because they
[56:20] weren't allowed in the gate to begin
[56:21] with they're on the outside but
[56:23] something moved on them when he
[56:24] prophesied something moved up and say
[56:26] hey what's the point in staying here and
[56:28] God and God loves to God can identify
[56:31] our anoint a kind of a faith in a person
[56:33] that says what's the good of staying in
[56:35] this kind of a life there's no point
[56:37] sitting here we're going to die in this
[56:39] condition we may be here by Samaria the
[56:41] king may be there the prophet may be
[56:43] there but we're going to die here so
[56:44] what's the point in staying here and and
[56:46] friends we're not inviting you to go to
[56:48] the enemy's camp this morning but we're
[56:50] inviting you to Father's house this
[56:51] morning amen he's not the enemy he's
[56:53] your friend Hallelujah but they just
[56:55] said what's the point in living here
[56:57] we're going to die so we might as well
[56:58] try something different amen so I think
[57:01] it's such a good idea if life is not
[57:03] going anywhere try something different
[57:04] I'm not saying throw away God but but
[57:07] change your approach to God change your
[57:09] change your walk with God Amen don't do
[57:11] the same old thing because insanity is
[57:14] doing the same old thing expecting a
[57:15] different result I think Einstein said
[57:17] that he's a smart guy he knows what he's
[57:19] talking about
[57:20] all right so you know so so they decided
[57:23] what's the point what's the use in
[57:25] living the same kind of life we're going
[57:27] to die if we go there's famine in the
[57:28] city what's the point we'll die this
[57:30] well the syrians are our enemy but well
[57:32] they might they may if they kill us what
[57:34] we're going to die anyway they may feed
[57:36] us and then they go out there and see
[57:39] they didn't hear the prophecy of Elisha
[57:41] but something moved on them
[57:43] because their thinking had to change
[57:45] because they're thinking was really well
[57:47] where Israelites will stay by the gate
[57:48] maybe the king will give us some food
[57:50] and maybe that's how they were before
[57:52] The Siege started they'd be around the
[57:54] gate the gates would open and you know
[57:55] the the leftover food will be thrown to
[57:58] the poor or whatever more and you know
[58:00] but then something began to change and
[58:02] they're thinking what was that God was
[58:03] moving them
[58:04] you know maybe maybe I trust that maybe
[58:06] you're thinking maybe through the week
[58:08] you begin thinking a bit differently
[58:09] about a few things they're gonna be God
[58:11] trying to move you into a position of a
[58:13] blessing amen so there so there they
[58:15] were they came to this place what's the
[58:16] point which there's no point staying
[58:18] here let's go there
[58:20] so they go there they don't know what's
[58:21] going to happen we die we die you know
[58:22] and that's what happens when you just
[58:24] give up yeah
[58:25] sink or drown I'm going anyway you know
[58:28] though he slay me I'm gonna trust him
[58:30] Hallelujah and then so they go to the
[58:32] Syrian camp they're expecting a century
[58:34] on the outside maybe a maybe if we
[58:36] wanted to be hit by an arrow or so I
[58:37] don't know there's nothing
[58:39] and they go in there they go into a tent
[58:40] there's no one there you're this you
[58:43] know there's food on the boil you know I
[58:44] believe God maybe inspired them you know
[58:46] to cook some food just to flee at the
[58:48] right time aiming for his children to
[58:50] come and say oh boy look at this pointy
[58:52] here and there's this bride going on and
[58:54] you know they go through and they start
[58:55] loading up all this food they get all
[58:57] this treasure and you know they get all
[58:58] these blessings and you know they start
[59:00] to you know same thing with us with the
[59:02] word of God right you begin to get
[59:03] blessed you begin to realize man I'm so
[59:05] glad I'm not living at that gate anymore
[59:07] I mean I'm so glad I've come into this
[59:09] you know into Father's House begin to
[59:11] eat of these good things but then they
[59:13] begin to realize man if we get busted
[59:15] we're in trouble we're in Greater
[59:17] trouble now because we're actually
[59:18] withholding this from the whole of the
[59:19] city because remember they had to
[59:21] fulfill they they didn't have to go and
[59:23] see they had to go and be a witness yes
[59:25] I mean they had to go be a witness that
[59:27] the syrians had gone because the
[59:29] prophecy had to be fulfilled and then so
[59:31] they went there and then they started
[59:32] you know started bearing treasure and
[59:33] doing all kinds of things maybe their
[59:35] belly's right here been gorging
[59:36] themselves and and then their conscious
[59:38] began to get to them
[59:40] yeah you know we've got to go tell so so
[59:42] these lepers now you think about the
[59:43] most unlikely ones to bring a message of
[59:45] Deliverance a bunch of lepers here
[59:48] outcasts they go back and they maybe
[59:50] knock on the gate you know and maybe the
[59:52] little thing slides open what do you
[59:54] want you know because they would know
[59:56] their voices and I say the syrians
[59:58] aren't in the camp
[59:59] maybe he'd lit out a burp and all this
[1:00:01] food you know
[1:00:02] how do you know
[1:00:05] Hallelujah and yes they send out Scouts
[1:00:07] and everything but you know the rest of
[1:00:09] the story and then and exactly what
[1:00:10] Elisha prophesied yeah came into being
[1:00:14] hallelujah what happened because it was
[1:00:17] the it was actually the faith of those
[1:00:20] lepers
[1:00:21] the faith of those lepers saved the
[1:00:23] whole city yeah amen they didn't do that
[1:00:26] out of unbelievables actually Faith
[1:00:27] moved on their hearts because God had
[1:00:30] spoken a prophecy and they were the
[1:00:31] receivers of that prophecy not even
[1:00:33] knowing it Hallelujah and they caused it
[1:00:36] to come to pass amen see so they rose up
[1:00:39] and they went down to that camp and God
[1:00:40] rewarded their faith I mean is that
[1:00:43] right they not only saved this uh
[1:00:44] themselves they saved the whole city of
[1:00:46] Samaria don't they now they're now we're
[1:00:48] not uh now you're not invited tonight or
[1:00:50] this morning to go to the enemies Camp
[1:00:51] you're invited to Camp invited to come
[1:00:54] to the father's house where he's waiting
[1:00:55] for you amen will you believe it amen
[1:00:58] see you see there's a there's a whole
[1:01:00] thing through the scripture where God
[1:01:01] God identifies himself with those who
[1:01:04] with those who believe his word and love
[1:01:07] him amen amen I want to be I want to oh
[1:01:10] God because it's one thing to say I'm a
[1:01:12] Believer there's nothing for God to say
[1:01:13] yes they're a Believer right with his
[1:01:15] presence and that's what we really want
[1:01:16] in our lives isn't it where God comes
[1:01:18] down and amends Our Lives amen amen
[1:01:20] where God actually backs us up and says
[1:01:22] yes they're my child yes they're covered
[1:01:24] in my blood yes I dwell in them yes they
[1:01:26] are walking in my ways yes I love them
[1:01:28] amen hallelujah that's how we want to be
[1:01:30] this morning amen amen praise God Amen
[1:01:34] see just like natural Offspring there's
[1:01:36] attributes of a believer that that are
[1:01:38] within us and they're not you know like
[1:01:40] this this is saying about how you know
[1:01:42] God would come down and you know you
[1:01:44] know take his angels they go see it go
[1:01:46] see Adam and Eva sleep in the other look
[1:01:47] at them and the angels say you know
[1:01:49] father they look just like you you know
[1:01:51] you you do that with your kids you know
[1:01:53] my mom always used to joke and maybe
[1:01:54] I'll say it too you know you love your
[1:01:56] kids the most when they're asleep and
[1:01:58] you know
[1:01:59] and
[1:02:01] okay amen and uh
[1:02:03] you know but but you can go in and you
[1:02:05] look at them asleep and you can see
[1:02:06] their character see their facials and
[1:02:07] you say you know that looks like you and
[1:02:09] no honey that looks like you and you
[1:02:11] know you can see yourself and your
[1:02:12] children and then you can see their
[1:02:14] nature is is uh you can see where they
[1:02:17] got their nature from as well
[1:02:19] praise God good and bad oh my you can
[1:02:21] see a Stampy has just been dug duck duck
[1:02:23] you know you know but but God God does
[1:02:25] that with his children as well now I'm
[1:02:27] not talking about natural
[1:02:28] characteristics now I'm talking about a
[1:02:30] seed of Faith a seat Gene of God that he
[1:02:33] places in your soul amen where he looks
[1:02:35] down he says you know they are just like
[1:02:37] you the angels will say father they're
[1:02:39] just like you now if we look at how how
[1:02:42] God will work with his children down
[1:02:43] through we can see he does the same
[1:02:45] thing with you and I am amen where it's
[1:02:47] not just a you know because this is not
[1:02:48] something that's passed down by learning
[1:02:50] right it's not even by being raised in
[1:02:52] church no it's by when God reveals
[1:02:54] himself Amen to you and I what's
[1:02:56] happening of Faith really comes into
[1:02:58] manifestation and God says I could
[1:03:00] identify myself with that person
[1:03:02] I ma'am now every true witness of God
[1:03:05] will sometimes be put to a showdown amen
[1:03:07] amen we put to a showdown to prove oh
[1:03:09] how God loves to do it when he can find
[1:03:11] a real witness and it proves God like
[1:03:14] job evolved would he prove that he was
[1:03:15] genuine amen but God loves too God loves
[1:03:18] to find a real witness someone where he
[1:03:21] looks beyond their abilities and their
[1:03:23] mind and things he looks down to their
[1:03:24] soul and says they look just like me I
[1:03:27] mean because if you look at how the
[1:03:28] Believers acted Through the Bible I mean
[1:03:29] you can say actually how they acted we
[1:03:31] can see the same family trait passed
[1:03:33] down into the church of living God this
[1:03:35] morning amen how they how they overcame
[1:03:37] by faith I mean they didn't love their
[1:03:39] lives to the death they surrendered all
[1:03:40] amen they're willing to forsake all to
[1:03:42] follow God Amen that you know you know
[1:03:44] they turn the other cheek they were
[1:03:45] quick to forgive they were loving now
[1:03:47] kind amen all those attributes you can
[1:03:49] see of the believer you can see actually
[1:03:51] I can see my family tree
[1:03:53] Hallelujah maybe in your family maybe
[1:03:55] there's a temper or a stubbornness or
[1:03:57] something that's been passed down and
[1:03:58] you can say well unfortunately that's in
[1:04:00] my kid because it was in my granddad but
[1:04:02] you know now that's in the negative but
[1:04:03] what about now the positive right
[1:04:05] because God's given us power to overcome
[1:04:07] family strains right we you know it's
[1:04:09] amazing you see a little child as soon
[1:04:10] as they hit kind of teenage years it's
[1:04:12] like family strangers good it's like a
[1:04:13] button then everything turns on all
[1:04:15] those things say man where did that come
[1:04:17] from what was it within them but you've
[1:04:19] got to realize children you've got to
[1:04:21] actually actually over don't be ruled by
[1:04:23] your feelings
[1:04:24] right that's a great Victor when you
[1:04:26] realize you may feel happy oh no you may
[1:04:28] feel sad you don't have to be sad
[1:04:29] because you feel sad you don't have to
[1:04:31] be lonely because you feel lonely you
[1:04:33] don't have to feel uh misunderstood
[1:04:35] because you know or be misunderstood
[1:04:37] because you feel misunderstood don't be
[1:04:38] led by your feelings your feelings are
[1:04:40] like you know it's just like the wind or
[1:04:42] it's like in Auckland you get five
[1:04:44] seasons in one day I don't know what the
[1:04:46] fifth is but it's always changing that's
[1:04:48] how it was at school up there be raining
[1:04:50] in the morning there's something that's
[1:04:51] hailing it's doing all this like I
[1:04:53] thought it was summertime well no and
[1:04:54] it's well I can't say much for him well
[1:04:56] it's just windy so anyway at least we're
[1:04:58] anyway but you know but but don't be led
[1:05:00] by your feelings see you see because
[1:05:01] your feelings become alive because
[1:05:02] you're turning into an adult but you've
[1:05:04] got to realize my my feelings don't have
[1:05:06] to rule me amen right
[1:05:09] praise God Amen so so God loves to find
[1:05:12] a real Witness
[1:05:14] amen now I got some photo pictures and
[1:05:17] things today just because you know we
[1:05:18] had a awesome day yesterday so those are
[1:05:20] able by Revelation realized it was it
[1:05:22] was the lamb I mean it was a blood it
[1:05:25] was a blood sin in the garden amen so
[1:05:27] God required blood now I don't know if
[1:05:29] he knew it or not but before the
[1:05:31] foundation the world the lamb was slain
[1:05:33] right so so God put a revelation in in
[1:05:37] Abel's heart that it was a lamb slaying
[1:05:39] now it wasn't a natural lamb it was the
[1:05:41] Lamb of God but because it was revealed
[1:05:44] to Abel he realized I've got to offer a
[1:05:45] lamb because a lamb was slammed before
[1:05:47] the foundation of the world for me and
[1:05:49] lambskins covered my appearance when
[1:05:51] they came out of the garden so he
[1:05:53] offered the lamb and God came down and
[1:05:54] identified himself in his in his
[1:05:56] offering saying I can identify myself
[1:05:58] with that worship so God came down and
[1:06:01] consumed the sacrifice Cain on the other
[1:06:03] hand he just bought his fruit and
[1:06:05] veggies you know his his his his vegan
[1:06:08] offering and um
[1:06:10] oh boy and you know
[1:06:12] he bought his vegan offering if you're
[1:06:14] that okay I'm sorry for you but anyway
[1:06:15] you'll be fine
[1:06:18] but Meats anyway wow let's just leave it
[1:06:20] here anyway yes good hey God ate God God
[1:06:23] drank milk and he ate a calf right when
[1:06:26] he came down and flesh to Abraham
[1:06:28] there we go anyway but anyway so you see
[1:06:31] it wasn't it was Kane's self works man I
[1:06:34] give you
[1:06:35] it was Kane's ability to make his garden
[1:06:38] and he bought his works and said
[1:06:40] basically take it or leave it God
[1:06:42] and God said I can't identify myself in
[1:06:44] that worship I can't identify myself and
[1:06:47] what you think is best
[1:06:48] so God couldn't anoint that
[1:06:51] because it was by faith um able to
[1:06:54] offered that unto God a more excellent
[1:06:56] sacrifice than that of Cain so Cain
[1:06:57] sacrifice was excellent it was good it
[1:07:00] wasn't you know haphazard it was like
[1:07:02] have you ever seen like the Japanese how
[1:07:03] they do fruit and veggies like they'll
[1:07:05] do watermelons that are perfectly like a
[1:07:07] sphere
[1:07:08] they do it super good I think maybe Kane
[1:07:11] stuff would have been like that like
[1:07:13] incredible yeah I wouldn't have been
[1:07:14] like I just got to the Garden grab the
[1:07:16] closest thing and Chuck on an altar no
[1:07:18] it would have been very excellent yeah
[1:07:19] but Abel's was more excellent than that
[1:07:21] of Cain amen and he obtained because it
[1:07:23] was why by Revelation by faith amen so
[1:07:26] because it was by that way it wasn't by
[1:07:28] us human Works God could say I can
[1:07:30] identify myself with that amen now
[1:07:33] God loves to know so this is shamgar
[1:07:36] and you know the rest of the story those
[1:07:39] guys on the right-hand side all end up
[1:07:40] dead and shamgar still loves praise the
[1:07:42] Lord but you see now God God knows who
[1:07:45] he is right he's never unsure am I God
[1:07:48] am I the creator of heavens and earth am
[1:07:50] I the Redeemer of the church am I the
[1:07:52] high priest you know am I am I the
[1:07:54] advocate am I the counselor am I the
[1:07:56] Healer am I Jehovah Jireh am I Jehovah
[1:07:58] my you know am I all these attributes he
[1:08:01] he is never unsure of who he is he knows
[1:08:03] exactly who he is so when someone stands
[1:08:06] in faith and says I am a Son of God God
[1:08:08] has made me a Son of God or a daughter
[1:08:10] of God I am washed in his blood I have a
[1:08:12] covenant with God God can say and it not
[1:08:15] out of proud but ever out of a
[1:08:16] revelation God can then say I cannot I
[1:08:19] can Fellowship I can anoint that kind of
[1:08:21] a stand because remember shamgar was a
[1:08:24] was a circumcised son of Abraham he was
[1:08:27] living in the promised land now for
[1:08:29] years the Philistines will come in
[1:08:31] Harvest time after shamgar had harvested
[1:08:33] all of his uh crops and everything and
[1:08:36] they'd come and carry off for years the
[1:08:38] cycle would continue on but there came a
[1:08:40] season where that cycle came to an end
[1:08:42] and that all came because because
[1:08:44] something struck shamgar because he
[1:08:46] looked at the needs of his of us of his
[1:08:49] family you know they were all skin and
[1:08:50] bones they were you know their clothes
[1:08:52] were rotten away and all these things
[1:08:53] and yo yo yo he heard The Stomping of
[1:08:56] 600 Philistines you know it's
[1:08:58] interesting the devil kind of knows what
[1:09:00] what we're capable of
[1:09:02] because here's one farmer who's half
[1:09:04] starving but yet the Philistines sent
[1:09:07] 600 men to to to to to deal with them
[1:09:11] one they just seen one soldier one
[1:09:13] soldier could have taken this guy out if
[1:09:15] you think about it no but he's saying
[1:09:16] 600 because he's like I think I kind of
[1:09:18] know what this guy's capable of but
[1:09:20] shamgar had no idea and it's like you
[1:09:22] you know God I mean I mean the devil
[1:09:24] kind of thinks what you're capable of he
[1:09:27] kind of yo he's scared of you if you
[1:09:29] haven't realized the devil's actually
[1:09:30] scared of you you're here to torment him
[1:09:32] yeah not he told me you amen amen it's a
[1:09:34] sham go one day he saw the state of his
[1:09:36] family and because you know brother man
[1:09:38] would say it's like you know you get
[1:09:39] blessings in church you get a harvest
[1:09:41] and the devil wants to come and take
[1:09:43] away those blessings
[1:09:44] you know and then you just go back to a
[1:09:46] Monday itis again you go back through a
[1:09:48] cycle but God doesn't want you to go
[1:09:50] through a cycle again he doesn't want
[1:09:51] you to have the Monday blues it should
[1:09:53] be a Sunday on a Monday and then a two
[1:09:55] and then a Sunday on a Tuesday and then
[1:09:57] a Wednesday and a Sunday on a Wednesday
[1:09:58] and then a Sunday and a Wednesday on a
[1:10:00] Thursday and then a Wednesday or Sunday
[1:10:02] on a Friday at Hallelujah and then
[1:10:04] Saturday praise God and then Sunday's
[1:10:06] coming again Hallelujah that's how it
[1:10:07] should be Amen in spite of what's going
[1:10:09] on in life Hallelujah and then so he's
[1:10:12] so he heard The Stomping of the
[1:10:13] Philistines he saw the state of his
[1:10:15] family and it doesn't say in the Bible
[1:10:17] that God said to him you're a son of
[1:10:19] Abraham you can whip all of them he just
[1:10:20] picked up his Ox goat because he
[1:10:22] realized that he was a circumcised son
[1:10:25] of Abraham which means God made a
[1:10:27] covenant with him and he said that's all
[1:10:29] he needed that's what made the
[1:10:30] difference and he took his Ox go jumped
[1:10:32] out the window and killed 600 men why
[1:10:35] because God could identify himself with
[1:10:38] a man who stood on his god-given rights
[1:10:41] of his birth amen and if we could just
[1:10:43] stand on our god-given rights of our new
[1:10:45] birth amen that now we're Sons and
[1:10:48] Daughters of God not one day now we are
[1:10:50] amen you know we're built to have
[1:10:52] dominion over this Earth amen Adam and
[1:10:54] Eve had dominion over this Earth see
[1:10:56] everything in this everything in this
[1:10:58] world Amen we have dominion over every
[1:11:00] sickness every devil every disease every
[1:11:04] trouble anxiety depression unbelief
[1:11:07] whatever it might be we have dominion
[1:11:08] over why because we're Sons and
[1:11:10] Daughters of God right now amen so if
[1:11:13] you stand on your god-given rights
[1:11:15] because you've got to realize sham
[1:11:16] Garden earned being a son of Abraham
[1:11:19] he was born one yeah
[1:11:23] he did not steal that land that was his
[1:11:25] land God gave him that land amen God's
[1:11:28] given us a land
[1:11:30] God's given us abundant the land flowing
[1:11:32] with milk and honey flowing with
[1:11:33] blessings flowing with Revelation faith
[1:11:35] and overcoming power whether Ralph
[1:11:37] Lauren with Rapture Resurrection it's
[1:11:39] all in there amen God's given it to us
[1:11:41] it's given it to us right now I mean
[1:11:43] it's not one day no we possess all
[1:11:45] things right now Hallelujah so God can
[1:11:48] say so God said I can I can I'm going to
[1:11:50] join you in the battle shamgar
[1:11:52] hallelujah hallelujah and that man with
[1:11:55] an ox go killed all these Soldiers with
[1:11:57] Spears and armor and all these things
[1:11:59] down to every one of them Hallelujah
[1:12:01] Glory
[1:12:02] Hallelujah somebody just standing out
[1:12:05] God given rights I'm a subtle daughter
[1:12:06] of God I'm a child of the most high God
[1:12:09] not because I've made myself that's no
[1:12:11] God called me amen before eternity he
[1:12:13] put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:15] amen I came into this world my what was
[1:12:19] it
[1:12:20] wasn't the first cry singing your praise
[1:12:23] amen hallelujah I have a reason to
[1:12:25] worship
[1:12:26] Hallelujah
[1:12:28] amen so I think we can Rejoice this
[1:12:30] morning if you know because this is what
[1:12:31] God identifies himself with amen amen no
[1:12:34] sometimes God will give you a God will
[1:12:37] give and speak an inspiration and then
[1:12:40] you're actually the one who fulfills
[1:12:41] that inspiration now I'm not sure
[1:12:43] exactly when David wrote The Psalm but I
[1:12:44] believe it would have been before he
[1:12:46] brought the ark into the city
[1:12:47] so so you know David will be writing and
[1:12:50] you know you know playing music God
[1:12:52] would Inspire him and and you know he
[1:12:54] began to prophesy things through his
[1:12:55] songs and one of them here is lift up he
[1:12:58] lift up your heads over your Gates and
[1:12:59] be and be lift up you ever laughed
[1:13:02] lasting doors and the king of glory
[1:13:04] shall come in who is this king of glory
[1:13:06] the lord strong and mighty the Lord
[1:13:09] Mighty in battle lift up your heads over
[1:13:11] your Gates even lift them up ye
[1:13:13] Everlasting doors and the king of glory
[1:13:15] shall come in who is this king of glory
[1:13:17] the lord of hosts he is the king of
[1:13:19] glory Selah see we know that this you
[1:13:22] know prophecy has compound meanings and
[1:13:25] you know we know of course ultimately
[1:13:26] this is when the you know when the Lord
[1:13:28] emptied out paradise there on that
[1:13:30] resurrection that time and you know you
[1:13:32] know there's the disciples all broken
[1:13:34] heart and everything but you know the
[1:13:35] Lord Jesus you know he conquered hell
[1:13:37] death in the grave and after he took the
[1:13:39] keys of Hell death the grave of Satan
[1:13:40] Boot and back down to how he has sent it
[1:13:42] up high you know you know went into
[1:13:44] Paradise opened the door and said
[1:13:45] children you've been waiting for me all
[1:13:46] these years here I am let's go
[1:13:48] hallelujah amen and then so they came up
[1:13:51] to the Glorious City then there was a
[1:13:52] you know then then all the redeem that
[1:13:55] were there David was actually part of
[1:13:57] the strong
[1:13:58] that cried out Lefty up your heads or
[1:13:59] your Gates and and B lift up yeah
[1:14:01] lasting doors the king of glory shall
[1:14:03] come in there's a question from the
[1:14:05] battlements who's the king of glory then
[1:14:07] David would say the Lord strong Mighty
[1:14:09] the Lord Mighty in battle so you know so
[1:14:12] that that was a fulfillment right but
[1:14:14] then it was also upon the earth when
[1:14:16] David would bring bring the ark into the
[1:14:18] city
[1:14:19] now when David first tried to bring the
[1:14:21] ark into the city it didn't go very well
[1:14:24] because they put the Ark on a new card
[1:14:26] and of course you know it began to
[1:14:27] stumble and then so one good man tried
[1:14:29] to stop the ark falling off and he was
[1:14:31] you know died and so on but the thing is
[1:14:33] that that didn't stop David
[1:14:35] amen that didn't stop David because he
[1:14:36] because he'd received this inspiration
[1:14:39] yeah that that that the that the Lord is
[1:14:42] going to come into His City Hallelujah
[1:14:44] and you're the ark you know we know that
[1:14:46] you know when David was anointed king it
[1:14:48] said that God was with him from that day
[1:14:50] forth but we know the ark is where God
[1:14:52] said that I'll commune with you I mean
[1:14:54] above The Mercy Seat between the
[1:14:56] cherubims and so David because he was
[1:14:58] the kind of a believer that just wanted
[1:14:59] to be in the prince of God he didn't
[1:15:01] want the ark to be in Shiloh and silence
[1:15:03] anymore he didn't want to be out with
[1:15:05] the Philistines or anywhere but he
[1:15:07] wanted the ark to be in a city where God
[1:15:08] could speak to his people where people
[1:15:10] could could come into the presence of
[1:15:12] God and receive the inspiration of the
[1:15:14] word and you know that was David's
[1:15:15] longing Hallelujah and so so the first
[1:15:19] time you know the ark um was on the cart
[1:15:20] and there was a failure but then but
[1:15:22] then David was determined amen because
[1:15:24] this is what faith does faith may you
[1:15:26] know you know there may be obstacles in
[1:15:28] the way but doesn't mean we quit amen
[1:15:30] right we don't quit right we persevere
[1:15:32] amen if there's trouble well we just go
[1:15:35] through the trouble we ask God how do we
[1:15:36] get through the trouble I mean we don't
[1:15:38] just throw up our hands and say well
[1:15:39] devil I Surrender now I guess you've won
[1:15:41] no
[1:15:43] we don't have surrender in our
[1:15:44] vocabulary it's not in our family line
[1:15:48] to surrender amen right if you look at
[1:15:50] our family tree wasn't in David's was it
[1:15:53] in David's vocabulary to surrender no no
[1:15:56] was it in shamgars no was it in Moses no
[1:16:00] Hallelujah none of them it wasn't in
[1:16:02] them to quit it wasn't in the apostles
[1:16:04] vocabulary just to throw it you know
[1:16:06] throw it all in because persecution came
[1:16:07] their way no and it shouldn't be in our
[1:16:09] vocabulary either to quit we're gonna
[1:16:12] push a battle Yeah I mean what was
[1:16:14] brother Brown told me on the curtain of
[1:16:15] time keep pressing the battle I mean you
[1:16:18] got to keep pressing it Forward amen
[1:16:20] don't just don't just live like the four
[1:16:22] lepers on the you're outside the Gate of
[1:16:24] Samaria and say well here we are no
[1:16:25] we've got to press the battle we're
[1:16:27] gonna step out into the unknown amen
[1:16:29] we're gonna we're gonna go beyond our
[1:16:31] comfort zone and well this is my
[1:16:32] lifestyle forget the lifestyle walk with
[1:16:35] God that's what we should be doing amen
[1:16:37] so David now David was so happy because
[1:16:40] you see because he said no see see it
[1:16:43] was the Lord Mighty in battle was coming
[1:16:46] into the city coming into his City now
[1:16:49] he began to dance before the ark why
[1:16:52] because the very God
[1:16:54] that gave him the lion and gave him the
[1:16:56] beer and gave him Goliath and gave him
[1:16:59] all of his victories and kept him from
[1:17:02] Saul and kept him through all trouble
[1:17:03] now the very Ark that represented the
[1:17:06] presence of God himself was coming into
[1:17:07] a city after many years of fighting and
[1:17:11] distress and trouble and mountains and
[1:17:14] valleys and hardship and it say Lord I
[1:17:16] wet my pillow with my tears and you keep
[1:17:18] all my tears in a bottle and Lord I'm
[1:17:21] Forsaken and what's going on Lord my
[1:17:23] enemies around about me all this trouble
[1:17:24] but finally God led him through all
[1:17:27] those things and then he began to dance
[1:17:29] before the ark and say glory to God I
[1:17:31] mean it wasn't he didn't care about what
[1:17:33] people thought of him I mean it was just
[1:17:35] something from his heart saying Lord I'm
[1:17:37] so thankful
[1:17:39] I'm so glad Lord that you would allow me
[1:17:42] to bring your presence
[1:17:44] your word
[1:17:46] your word your presence into my city
[1:17:50] Hallelujah you may think of a bit
[1:17:52] emotional but there's something when God
[1:17:53] when God because God is suffering God
[1:17:56] God remember this is not democracy with
[1:17:59] God
[1:18:00] we say Lord we voted you have to come to
[1:18:03] church today no or you have to come into
[1:18:05] my life because like no no he chooses he
[1:18:08] is Sovereign he says yes I'm going to
[1:18:10] join them today I'm going to come
[1:18:11] identify myself with that individual
[1:18:13] today and it's and nothing can change
[1:18:15] his mind really it's him it's him that
[1:18:18] does it he he decides so God God
[1:18:21] actually allowed David this is David's
[1:18:23] heart and his longing of his life
[1:18:26] because he wants to dwell in the prince
[1:18:27] of God forever and this was this was him
[1:18:30] upon the Earth saying Lord you've given
[1:18:32] me that request on this side and he was
[1:18:34] so thankful that God would allow that
[1:18:36] and then he began to dance before the
[1:18:39] Lord and dance around the ark and
[1:18:40] rejoice and Shout him you know some
[1:18:43] people didn't didn't enjoy it at all you
[1:18:45] know he had you know his you know his um
[1:18:47] Saul's daughter McCall that was married
[1:18:49] to me I looked out of the palace Windows
[1:18:51] this is all going on all the commotion
[1:18:53] and you know she began to despise her
[1:18:55] husband in her heart saying this is so
[1:18:57] unseemly for the king of Israel you mean
[1:18:59] to be dignified and you're the king and
[1:19:01] have this kind of a Persona and you know
[1:19:03] Untouchable and you know
[1:19:05] you know and then and then and then so
[1:19:07] so David you know you know uh yo yo that
[1:19:10] night yo she said you know oh how the
[1:19:12] king of Israel behaved himself dancing
[1:19:14] half naked before all of Israel and all
[1:19:16] these things and he just said well if
[1:19:18] you don't like it today you're not going
[1:19:19] to like it tomorrow because I'm going to
[1:19:21] keep dancing before God Amen and God
[1:19:24] looked down and said that's a man after
[1:19:25] my own heart amen because remember David
[1:19:28] wasn't born perfect but he had a longing
[1:19:30] in his heart Lord I want you I want more
[1:19:33] of you I need more of you every day Lord
[1:19:36] that was that was how he was a man after
[1:19:38] God's Own Heart he had a longing Lord I
[1:19:40] want to be in your presence I don't just
[1:19:42] want it to be ceremony and formality and
[1:19:44] just a well well I can just rest on the
[1:19:46] testimonies of yesterday Lord I need you
[1:19:48] today amen and God says I can identify
[1:19:51] myself with that kind of a heart of a
[1:19:53] person holy so I trust that you're the
[1:19:55] same today amen that you've got a
[1:19:58] longing Lord I need you more today than
[1:20:00] I did yesterday I need you in my life I
[1:20:03] need you for my family Lord You're My
[1:20:05] satisfying Lord I've had a drink from
[1:20:07] your Everlasting founder but I need you
[1:20:09] more amen I need more of your word Lord
[1:20:11] we should never ever just analyze the
[1:20:14] scripture we should never approach God
[1:20:17] in an analytical fashion of trying to
[1:20:19] dissect and all these things no brother
[1:20:21] am says that's the problem with this
[1:20:22] lukewarm age people want to cut and and
[1:20:25] and and you know analyze the word but
[1:20:27] they're not interested in living it but
[1:20:29] someone who says Lord I want you to live
[1:20:31] then God says I can identify myself in
[1:20:33] that life and manifest themselves
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:40] Hallelujah
[1:20:42] there are three Hebrew children
[1:20:44] Glory
[1:20:45] now to me what actually makes us an
[1:20:47] incredible story is not actually because
[1:20:49] the fourth man is but because of their
[1:20:51] stand
[1:20:52] see there was a lot of commotion see I
[1:20:54] can't remember which my children asked
[1:20:56] where was Daniel doing this whole thing
[1:20:57] where I said well Daniel
[1:20:59] um you know actually that image that
[1:21:01] nebuchadism made was an image of Daniel
[1:21:03] you know because because Nebuchadnezzar
[1:21:06] saw God and Daniel so that well he must
[1:21:08] be a God himself and so that's why
[1:21:10] Daniel wasn't there right but you see
[1:21:12] now that those three Hebrew children
[1:21:14] they knew Daniel was just Daniel they
[1:21:16] weren't going to worship an image of a
[1:21:17] religious man and so now but there was a
[1:21:20] lot of pressure that was going on them
[1:21:21] you think about the pressure they're
[1:21:23] invited to that they knew what was going
[1:21:26] to happen but they went anyway but how
[1:21:28] when it the music played they knew the
[1:21:30] inevitable
[1:21:31] this is going to be the stages of a
[1:21:33] voice we're going to gather the trumpets
[1:21:36] are going to blow everyone's going to
[1:21:38] Bow we're not going to Bow then we're
[1:21:40] going to be burnt up
[1:21:42] that's our day that's our schedule
[1:21:45] that's our schedule but they had made up
[1:21:48] their mind I'm not trying to be silly
[1:21:50] but I just want you to think about it
[1:21:51] but they admire made up their mind we
[1:21:53] are not going to Bow because this is
[1:21:56] contrary to what we believe because when
[1:21:58] we bow we're showing all of our life as
[1:22:01] giving worship and we will not give
[1:22:03] worship to this image we worship the
[1:22:05] true and living God now when you decide
[1:22:07] to make a stand when you draw a line in
[1:22:10] the sand and do it early if you start a
[1:22:12] new job start school whatever you draw a
[1:22:14] line in the sand I'm a Christian
[1:22:16] right just say this I'm a Christian you
[1:22:18] don't need to Ram it down people sorry
[1:22:19] she said no I'm a Christian
[1:22:21] right then people will respect you for
[1:22:23] it but you're drawing a line in the sand
[1:22:24] like when they went to Babylon they said
[1:22:26] we're not going to defy ourselves defile
[1:22:28] ourselves with the king's Meats they
[1:22:30] started real early and they maintain
[1:22:32] that stand because just because you draw
[1:22:34] a line doesn't mean the devil's gonna
[1:22:35] not gonna try and pull you over that
[1:22:36] line right but you see they had already
[1:22:39] made up their minds yes
[1:22:42] no we're not going to Bow we're just
[1:22:44] going to burn you know whatever's gonna
[1:22:46] happen God can deliver us O King they
[1:22:48] would say to him
[1:22:49] but yet we're still not going to worship
[1:22:51] your image now God can identify himself
[1:22:54] with that kind of a stand when you
[1:22:56] really mean it in your heart when you
[1:22:58] really decided I'm following the Lord
[1:23:01] his word is my standard his word is my
[1:23:04] everything he's my life he's more
[1:23:06] important than my next breath to me I'm
[1:23:08] going to walk with this word no matter
[1:23:10] what comes opposition trials trouble who
[1:23:13] cares about it because we're not here to
[1:23:14] live before people we're here to live
[1:23:16] before God Amen so now now
[1:23:19] all that was going on they even dragged
[1:23:21] them before the king and so that would
[1:23:22] have been more pressure because they had
[1:23:24] seen no doubt because the other King's
[1:23:26] advisors they had seen the Wrath of the
[1:23:28] king being poured out on other people
[1:23:29] they knew what he was capable of when he
[1:23:31] said we're going to throw people in this
[1:23:32] furnace he they knew he meant it right
[1:23:36] but they see the when all that was going
[1:23:38] on brother Adam Silver now now that
[1:23:40] scene was going on upon the Earth but
[1:23:42] now let's go up into heaven and God's on
[1:23:45] his big Majestic throne and then and
[1:23:47] then Gabriel comes up next to him says
[1:23:49] master
[1:23:50] are you not seeing what's going down on
[1:23:52] there in Babylon
[1:23:54] and and God would say Gabriel
[1:23:56] I've been watching all day
[1:23:58] actually I've been watching them their
[1:23:59] entire life
[1:24:00] okay I've seen them
[1:24:03] well but I think Gabriel said but but
[1:24:06] Lord don't you see they're gonna throw
[1:24:07] they're going to throw them into the
[1:24:08] fire let me go down there he takes out
[1:24:10] his sword I'll change the whole picture
[1:24:12] oh yeah I'll level the whole empire and
[1:24:14] you know God would say to him you know
[1:24:16] you know Gabriel put your sword away
[1:24:17] being a faithful Angel he would have
[1:24:19] done it you're a good Angel your voice
[1:24:21] stood right by my side through thick and
[1:24:23] thin but I can't send you so you'd stand
[1:24:25] there then then wormwood would come
[1:24:26] wormwood was the one who could float all
[1:24:28] the um you know bro you know you know
[1:24:31] bring the floods and then you say master
[1:24:33] have you not seen what they're going to
[1:24:34] do to your three your three children
[1:24:36] there and they're in Babylon and of
[1:24:38] course God would say yeah I've been
[1:24:39] watching the whole time you know his
[1:24:40] eyes on the sparrow no I know he watches
[1:24:42] me amen are you aware that his eyes upon
[1:24:44] you I mean not to not to wait see God
[1:24:47] doesn't watch us just before we're going
[1:24:49] to trip up and then he's gonna deal a
[1:24:51] deal with us about it no God's eyes are
[1:24:54] part of it because he wants to protect
[1:24:55] us he cares for us he's mindful of us I
[1:24:58] mean so you know yo wormwood says you
[1:24:59] know I can drown all of Babylon just
[1:25:01] like that just let me go do it I'll he
[1:25:05] says no no I can't let you do it and
[1:25:07] then so you know you're a good Angel you
[1:25:08] flooded the world to Noah's day but I
[1:25:10] can't let you do it right now and they
[1:25:12] said well what are you going to do
[1:25:13] Master he says he says they have made a
[1:25:15] stand for me I'm going to make a stand
[1:25:17] all right all right Hallelujah
[1:25:19] hallelujah amen my children has to take
[1:25:24] us has took a stand so I'm taking a
[1:25:26] stand too Amen to God what did he do he
[1:25:29] dropped his Priestly ropes hey man he
[1:25:31] took a leaf off the tree of life zigzag
[1:25:34] lightning took it down there into
[1:25:35] Babylon and as soon as they were just
[1:25:37] being thrown to the fire how many
[1:25:39] stepped into the fire amen why because
[1:25:41] they made a stand God took a stand I
[1:25:44] mean because God said I can identify
[1:25:46] myself with them amen I can have
[1:25:49] Fellowship I can be a witness saying yes
[1:25:51] their standards my stand amen when God
[1:25:54] can see himself for you and you and I
[1:25:56] that's when he says amen hallelujah
[1:25:59] and that's when he anoints us amen
[1:26:02] hallelujah my children has took a stand
[1:26:04] I'm taking a stand too amen if he could
[1:26:07] come all the way from glory to Babylon
[1:26:08] for three children how much more will he
[1:26:10] come to Phoenix I'd say to Wellington
[1:26:12] this morning for all those who are
[1:26:14] sitting here bound the arrows come
[1:26:15] father the hour has come amen if he can
[1:26:18] go all the way to Babylon for them under
[1:26:19] the blood of bulls and goats how much
[1:26:21] more you and I under the blood of Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ amen we make our stand then he'll
[1:26:25] stand with us
[1:26:26] Hallelujah
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:30] praise God
[1:26:32] you know
[1:26:33] God will identify himself with people
[1:26:36] who look for him
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:40] he looks he looks for people over desire
[1:26:43] amen now dryas dryas was the leader of
[1:26:46] the synagogue we know that his daughter
[1:26:48] was getting ill and and and all the
[1:26:50] doctors in the world couldn't help her
[1:26:52] but he knew that there was must be a god
[1:26:55] somewhere you know he knew you know he
[1:26:57] would teach his great Jehovah God who
[1:26:58] split the Red Sea and did all incredible
[1:27:00] things and raised the dead and you know
[1:27:03] all these things in the past but
[1:27:05] something in him moved and said he must
[1:27:06] be alive somewhere today and then he
[1:27:09] heard of heard of Jesus of Nazareth and
[1:27:11] what what God was doing through his life
[1:27:12] and he began to realize actually the god
[1:27:15] of history is the god of today and
[1:27:17] brother bran would say in another place
[1:27:18] that he put on his old preacher's coat
[1:27:20] and he went off looking for the god of
[1:27:21] history I mean because something moved
[1:27:23] in his heart saying he must be alive
[1:27:24] today and God and and whenever someone
[1:27:27] really is sincere and they really want
[1:27:30] to see God alive God says I can identify
[1:27:32] myself with that kind of a longing amen
[1:27:35] because because God doesn't put a long
[1:27:36] in someone's heart just to leave it
[1:27:38] there God will satisfy every Hungry
[1:27:40] Heart amen everyone who hungers and
[1:27:42] thirsts after writes I'll be filled amen
[1:27:45] so so so he began to realize you know
[1:27:48] that baby laying there said God cannot
[1:27:50] die for he is the god for eternity that
[1:27:53] baby laying on the bed stretched out
[1:27:55] that little driest knowing that the
[1:27:56] shooter might got her baby back he said
[1:27:58] that God of History if he could ever be
[1:28:00] called into action he's the same God
[1:28:01] today and searching through he found of
[1:28:04] some man that claimed to have the power
[1:28:06] that was Jesus of Nazareth who they all
[1:28:08] hated but he called him on the scene and
[1:28:11] he was the closest representative he
[1:28:13] could find of God at that day a god of
[1:28:15] the Living God and when he was called on
[1:28:17] the scene in the historical God was
[1:28:19] called up he acted the same way he did
[1:28:21] when he spoke to Elijah on that dead
[1:28:23] baby amen what his daughter came back to
[1:28:27] life you know when God gives a promise
[1:28:29] and the devil tries to steal it away
[1:28:31] those who stand on that promise and say
[1:28:33] no the devil cannot take it God
[1:28:36] identifies himself with that kind of a
[1:28:38] Faith remember because the shunawat
[1:28:39] woman was childless until Elisha or
[1:28:42] Elijah said that she's going to have a
[1:28:44] baby right but then when the boy got
[1:28:46] older and then then he went out working
[1:28:47] in the field with his father and then
[1:28:49] and then he said ah my head what he got
[1:28:51] sunstroke then they then they took him
[1:28:53] back to the shunamite and then
[1:28:54] eventually sadly he died now then she
[1:28:56] said you know lay him lay him on the bed
[1:28:59] and the little room that we made for the
[1:29:00] prophet and then and then sat on me a
[1:29:03] mule we're gonna go get the prophet
[1:29:04] because she realized if God gave me the
[1:29:07] child amen the devil can't take the
[1:29:09] child till it's God said so rights of
[1:29:11] God given you the promises given you the
[1:29:13] children amen then then God I mean the
[1:29:16] devil cannot take them amen God must
[1:29:18] restore them back amen and if you have
[1:29:20] that determination in your heart this
[1:29:22] morning what God has given me won't come
[1:29:25] back to me then God will say I can
[1:29:26] identify I can anoint that kind of a
[1:29:28] faith and that faith will go out and get
[1:29:30] them and bring them home Hallelujah I
[1:29:33] believe that with all my heart amen of
[1:29:35] God's given a promise the devil can't
[1:29:37] take the promise amen just like when
[1:29:39] ziglag was taken by the Phyllis I mean
[1:29:41] by the amalekites or whoever it was
[1:29:42] David's memorandum battle there you know
[1:29:44] with the Philistines then they came back
[1:29:46] found all their family or everything
[1:29:48] taken and I mean God what what what did
[1:29:51] what did David do he encouraged himself
[1:29:52] in the Lord I didn't want to do he went
[1:29:54] to a source of strength and whenever
[1:29:56] whenever we turn to God God says I can
[1:29:59] meet that kind of a longing amen I can
[1:30:01] meet that kind of a need and what did
[1:30:03] God tell them pursue you'll recover all
[1:30:05] why because God had given David family
[1:30:07] he had given his men family and things
[1:30:09] so the enemy had stolen them what
[1:30:11] happened God said you can recover all
[1:30:13] Hallelujah
[1:30:15] amen do you believe that this morning
[1:30:17] amen that because why if he gave the
[1:30:20] promise he will keep the promise amen if
[1:30:22] we can just stand on his word if God is
[1:30:24] able to give it amen he's able to keep
[1:30:27] it Hallelujah
[1:30:28] amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful for
[1:30:31] that this morning
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:34] Hallelujah
[1:30:36] praise the Lord amen this is so that's
[1:30:38] why we'll just leave it with us I'm
[1:30:40] gonna I'm just gonna close with us again
[1:30:43] God rewarded the leper's faith
[1:30:46] now now what's your faith doing today
[1:30:49] as God Amen in your life and when he
[1:30:51] looks down at your life does he see
[1:30:53] himself on you does he see the same
[1:30:55] actions the same character amen do you
[1:30:57] hold grudges or do you do there's
[1:31:00] nothing in you to hold grudges it's like
[1:31:02] you got pants or a skirt with no pockets
[1:31:04] you can't put anything in them so you
[1:31:05] can't put any you can't put grudges in
[1:31:07] your life you can't carry on Gossip or
[1:31:10] unforgiveness or resentment or whatever
[1:31:12] you can't you can't carry any malice
[1:31:14] it's just Joy love peace long-suffering
[1:31:18] gentleness kindness Faith that's just
[1:31:20] all you're built up in amen amen why
[1:31:22] because because remember if we're to be
[1:31:23] like Jesus we should walk like Jesus we
[1:31:25] should talk like Jesus we should act
[1:31:27] like Jesus we should forgive like Jesus
[1:31:29] we should love like Jesus amen we should
[1:31:32] be a surrendered vessel like Jesus
[1:31:33] Hallelujah shouldn't that be how we are
[1:31:36] amen if we are that in our heart God
[1:31:38] will come down and amen Our Lives
[1:31:40] because that's what we want isn't it for
[1:31:41] God to vindicate Our Lives because it's
[1:31:43] easy to say well God anointed brother
[1:31:45] Branham but God's to anoint to bride in
[1:31:47] this last day and we they happen to be
[1:31:49] part of that bride in this last day so
[1:31:51] can God come down into your life this
[1:31:53] morning and say I can identify myself in
[1:31:57] them
[1:31:58] see Moses before Moses before
[1:32:01] um the burning bush he tried to fulfill
[1:32:03] the word in his own strength God could
[1:32:06] name in that he killed one Egyptian that
[1:32:08] was it
[1:32:09] but when it came to the burning bush he
[1:32:12] surrendered everything then God used the
[1:32:14] same man to get two two million people
[1:32:16] out of a Nation
[1:32:18] why because God amend his life
[1:32:20] as he Amen in your life this morning if
[1:32:23] there's anything in your life that's not
[1:32:25] that needs to get get out because we
[1:32:27] can't keep living the same old way we
[1:32:30] can't just put on suits and ties and
[1:32:31] come to church and say we believe the
[1:32:33] message that's not it no it's when God
[1:32:36] amends the word in your life
[1:32:39] because what is the message to do make
[1:32:42] the Bible become flesh
[1:32:44] Everything Jesus died from Calvary would
[1:32:46] become flesh and you and I Hallelujah
[1:32:49] that his life will come unto you and I
[1:32:50] and live that's why see David wanted God
[1:32:52] to anoint his life
[1:32:54] that's what he wanted he wanted God to
[1:32:56] amen that that his life would be
[1:32:58] pleasing to God
[1:32:59] now are our lives pleasing to God this
[1:33:02] morning I just want to it feels A bit
[1:33:04] chaotic in here this morning but I just
[1:33:06] trust you just think about it this
[1:33:07] morning has got a meaning is there a
[1:33:10] Sweetness in our hearts
[1:33:11] is there not a you know if there's a
[1:33:14] business and a resentment that's that's
[1:33:15] or doubt that's all satan
[1:33:18] right but is there a sweetness is it
[1:33:21] Lord I love you I love everyone I even
[1:33:23] love my worst enemy life is awesome
[1:33:25] because you're in my life every day is
[1:33:27] worth living Lord you've given me
[1:33:29] purpose Lord I just want to be you know
[1:33:31] it's like Brother Band would speak about
[1:33:32] and and I will close with this
[1:33:35] he speaks about the Lily growing out of
[1:33:37] the mud up into the sunshine
[1:33:40] and he says that Lily has got to
[1:33:42] overcome the shell the mud and the
[1:33:44] waters in order to open up above the
[1:33:46] waters amen so the so the lilies first
[1:33:49] got to overcome the shell itself its own
[1:33:51] life its own comfort zone its own
[1:33:53] lifestyle go beyond that then it's got
[1:33:55] to go through the mud which is sin right
[1:33:57] grow beyond that then it's got to go
[1:33:59] through the waters what is that people's
[1:34:01] opinions whatever one thinks got to grow
[1:34:03] beyond all that if people don't you know
[1:34:05] people resent you for shouting amen shut
[1:34:07] amen anyway amen people resent you for
[1:34:10] having uncut hair long skirts whatever
[1:34:11] people give you funny looks just you're
[1:34:13] not living for to please them we're not
[1:34:15] here to please one another we're not

[1:34:27] and where are you going to spend
[1:34:28] eternity thankfully not here
[1:34:30] in this current state
[1:34:34] so you're going to be willing to
[1:34:35] overcome the shell yourself the mud of
[1:34:37] sin and the Waters of people in order to
[1:34:39] come out on the top and actually
[1:34:40] actually
[1:34:41] manifest the life that was within you
[1:34:44] from the beginning
[1:34:45] but you've got to be like the four
[1:34:46] lepers
[1:34:48] what's the point in staying here
[1:34:51] we're going to grow
[1:34:52] amen so God has sent his word
