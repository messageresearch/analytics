good morning everyone how's everyone today amen trust everyone's wonderful praise the lord it's great to have sister savvy here god bless you welcome god bless you amen amen praise the lord amen let's um go to the scripture um we're going to go to exodus 33 and as you're turning in your bible so this coming sunday we've got brother tazewell preaching here through him for a big feast praise the lord amen so yep so we're excited about that um amen so exodus 33 and verse 12. exodus 33 and 12 and we're going to read down to verse 17. and moses said unto the lord see thou sayeth unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou has said i know thee by name and thou and thou has also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in my sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for when shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not and that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and you're glad he's a personal god who knows you by name praise the lord amen this bow he's in a word of prayer this morning o lord jesus how great you are to us lord we will sing of our redeemer lord you're all together lovely lord you're the fairest of ten thousand to our soul i want to thank you dear god we can bow our heads in your presence one more time as a people and give you praise i just want to ask lord as we have read your word i feel very insufficient to to stand here this morning but lord i just pray you come and take over one more time may you anoint speaker and hearer i just ask that you will do a work in our lives lord i want to thank you you do know us by name lord we are lord you're a personal god to us you're not someone else's god you're our god and i pray dear lord you would mold us and shape us and make us more like you just want to commit our lives we want to surrender our all all that we are into your hands lord have your way this morning and dear god once again we want to remember those who are not here today may be their portion lord if they are sick and body lord i pray you'd heal them may you touch them and father you see every bird in a knee that we carry on our hearts oh god i pray lord that you would answer those according to your riches and glory this day grant it lord we just want to submit ourselves unto your great divine hand for your glory we ask all these things in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may have your seats this morning i'd like to speak about uh being in his presence he said my presence will go with thee and i will give thee rest now to me this is a very deep uh and powerful part of the scripture it's a very powerful thing you see where moses if you could if we could just go where moses was just there so so they had moses had been commissioned at the burning bush he'd you know he said yo god said i've heard the cries of my people and behold i'm sending you to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians so god went with him commissioned him that he went down into egypt you know all the plagues were done all the judgments came upon egypt because the hardness of pharaoh god had delivered israel out of the hand of the egyptians they'd cross the red sea that done many mighty things god had done but yet moses and i and and to me i feel like he's really expressing the heart of every real sincere genuine believer that they want to know they have found grace or divine favor in the sight of the lord isn't that really what we want to know lord i want to know i've found grace in your sight you've done so much for me already you've taken me from from sin and death and shame and you know you've broken the shackles of the devil off my life but yet i still want to know have i found grace in your sight you know to me he's expressing really the heart of every true believer you know he's they had journeyed you know they were journeying says like every true believer you know they want to know if they found grace in the sight of the lord because a true believer doesn't take god's salvation for granted right it's not common to them it's not some but it's still an incredible thing you know when you think about the lord jesus you know when he stepped out of history to you you know how incredible when he made his life made his word live in your life you know when he answered your hungry hearts cry oh god there must be more to life than than what i'm experiencing and i heard you know i believe you're real but lord i want to see you real i want to see you step out of history i just don't want to read the bible and and walk on and nothing happened to me but i want to see you the god of the bible come and make your word live in my life and him and his great sovereignty said i'll answer that cry i'll answer you amen i will actually show you my glory i'll show you my power i'll show you my word is still the same that i have not changed that i will show you that i'm not just a god of history that i'm not just someone else's god but i'll be your god amen and he does far more than you can ever imagine hallelujah we just cry out for salvation he does more than just save us amen but he fills us with his spirit amen he proves his word to us time and time again is the same thing with moses god proved himself time and time again i mean he proved himself in pharaoh's palace there turning you know you know the serpent eating up all the other magicians serpents you know he proved himself when the red sea you know was part he proved himself when you know they came to that place of bitter water and god showed him what tree to cut down to throw it into the bitter experience to make it sweet and you know it's just like us we have bitter experiences in our life but there's a tree that can be cut down and put into your experience to make it sweet and that is the cross of calvary amen if you can take any experience into calvary it will become sweet hallelujah it won't change the experience but it will make it sweet in your memory amy because god you'll see that god is working out something for your good hallelujah so you know they you know god gave them manna from heaven he did all incredible things but yet moses wanted to know can we know we've found grace in your sight you think about it it was grace that brought them out of egypt it wasn't their own ability that brought them out of egypt it was god's grace god god sent his deliverer amen it was god that sent it you know sure they had a cry oh god we when we deliver us but it's one thing to cry to god is nothing for god to answer that cry hallelujah to me you think about that you know that makes me feel about this big we're the great god of glory the great one who's the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end who made all time and all space and fills all eternity the great being that he is and yet he comes down to to this little speck in the middle of the milky way and reveals himself to you and i am hallelujah amen we should always be thankful we should never let that see the devil wants the devil wants our testimony to become common to us but we should never ever let it become common it should be rich and great every day and we should really as we walk with him we should just appreciate them more hallelujah no doubt moses appreciated when when when god came and spoke to him in the burning bush but he would have appreciated god more when he had his first contest with pharaoh and then the next contest and the next contest the next contest and then he would appreciate him even more when israel was crying out you've brought us to a death trap here by the red sea but god says you know just raise up your staff and i'll park the waters he would appreciate it in there more holy and everything god did for him and even with his temper even with his trouble i mean god still did great things for him and the thing is you think about you and i even with our humanity and our failures and our and our sticky bits that we can't stand god still answers prayer god still undertakes for us god still fights our battles god still protects us god still leads us hallelujah so it should never become common it should just be richer i pray that 2022 would just be a great love affair between us and god hallelujah should just be honeymoon time irrespective of what's going on let the world fall apart we can't stop that but we can fall in love with jesus more and more every day so i pray this a real because that's what christianity really is it's a love affair between you and jesus christ amen amen we should always be thankful now um we won't read it but to save time if you read the second part of romans chapter one it shows a sequence of basically the degeneration of man where they start off knowing god but they didn't glorify him as god and they became unthankful that it fell down to basically what the world is today now the big main two factors of that degradation of man is that they didn't glorify god as god and they are unthankful this is from romans 1 and 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and foolish and in their foolish heart was darkened so this now to me now i want to do the opposite of this i mean so so they we don't so yes i want to do the opposite so i'm going to worship and praise god irrespective of my circumstances now we know god but we can glorify him not as god well then how do you do that if you're a believer you just glorify him as an errand boy now an errand boy does things you ask him to do so people will not people will just worship god based on what he does for them how much blessings they get how many answered prayers they get now we should thank him for those things but when times are tough where's the praise right because we don't i don't love the lord because he answers prayer no i i love the lord because of who he is and what he's done for me he saved my soul i mean that's more than enough if he never does a single thing anymore in my life amen he's already done more than enough amen why because he's he saved me he filled me with his holy ghost he set me free from every chain of the devil and i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory i mean so if he never does a single thing doesn't answer a single prayer i mean anymore he's already done more than enough and he's given me more than enough to praise him for because he's revealed himself to me i know him who he is obese we should praise god and worship him based on who he is not just on what he does for us i thank god when he answers prayer who's thankful when he answers prayer and a no is as good as a yes right as long as he gives me an answer i'm happy amen so i'm thankful when he heals my children or heals me or heals my wife or you know provides for us or gives an answer or leads us in certain you know different circumstances where we don't know the way i'm thankful for all of that but yet i don't get upset when he doesn't seem to do those things amen i worship him because of who he is not just because not i don't glorify him as an errand boy i glorify him as god hallelujah so so we want to glorify him as god and we want to be thankful hallelujah to praise him anyway amen if if your world falls apart praise him if everything's going good please praise him if you don't know the way out of the situation praise him if it seems like his answer lingers praise him praise him in the storm praise him in the good times praise him in the bad hallelujah don't you know don't be upset at him he's working all things out feel good hallelujah amen so if you become unthankful towards the lord then things become common we don't want to be unthankful i have a mansion hallelujah i have a mansion if it's near jesus or if it's on the i don't know the edge of the city praise the lord if i get one glimpse at him if he even if i need a telescope to see him i'll be glad i get to see him hallelujah that's how i feel i'm not worried i mean i'll be next door you know what i mean but but hey david said i'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of god so a doorkeeper they just let people in they open the door they shut the door they don't go on themselves but they're just a door keeper i'd rather be like that like david said that he said i'd rather be a a doorkeeper in the house of god than dwell in the tents of the wicked so hey if i'm a doormat if i'm on the outside and i just let people in praise the lord as long as i'm part of god's great you know kingdom for eternity that would make me real happy hallelujah so you know but but then the next step of this and i'm not i'm not going to dwell on this too much but the next step of being unthankful is people become vain in their imaginations now this this really comes down among believers all this because i put this all on me right the world will do what it does but the word needs to apply to me right this is not a pitchforking i did a bit of you know i you know i spent a bit of time on my friends farms growing up they never made hay and so i'm not going to make hay now and pitchfork it to be you know i'm not going to pitch for the work to other people i'm just going to apply it all to myself so people can become vain in their imaginations even even as believers no and and vain means it it becomes empty now it's very interesting if um in in philippians chapter 2 where where we love the piece of scripture it says but let this minors in christ be in you but before that verse the apostle paul says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves now this that word strife actually means it means to be um to have affection faction means you split off you have your own little group and it actually speaks about being like political so so don't do things through factions you know of of well well we believe this and this church is different so so we're just going to put them on the outside and this person is different here so this is my faction because they don't fit in my group and you know so don't let anything bad be done that way right and because what is that that's actually people become vain in their imaginations where they compare themselves with themselves because the bible says if you compare ourselves with ourselves we become wise i mean unwise so if we so if i compare myself to you i'm unwise but if i compare myself to the word i become wise right so we shouldn't let we yeah i pray we never get down that road because we're all human right but we should love the lord more we should appreciate them more we should be more thankful every day amen now moses said in in verse 16 if you want to pop that back up um he says for wherein shall it be no one here if i can find this for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou gost with us so so shall we be separated i am thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth so he's asking wherein shall it be known so so how shall we isn't this how it shall be known that we're found grace is because your presence is with us right this is this is verse 16 and so so moses knew that how he and the people had found grace in the sight of god is that the presence of the lord was with them now this is fundamental in the christian walk because jesus said i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee he said i'll be with you even in you i personal pronoun will be with you even in you to the end of the world so so the evidence if you know the evidence that that that we have found or one of the evidence is that we've found grace in the sight of the lord is that his presence is with us this is fundamental because people can because it's not just having the right word that proves he's with you now don't get well you can get quiet on me but maybe he's just thinking about this but the apostle paul said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so it's actually the holy ghost comes and anoints the word and makes it live in our hearts right it's not just having the right word you must we must have word and spirit right we can't have just spirit but we can't just have word we must have both together right so i believe that we have been restored back to the apostolic faith the original faith of the fathers right the original faith of the bible i believe we've been restored back to the book of acts right so what the apostles believe we believe what the apostle paul taught we believe amen but you but we must have the spirit of god to quicken it and make it live amen it's absolutely fundamental because if we do not have the spirit of god i mean to make the word live then it's all head knowledge and head knowledge will fall apart i mean it doesn't have a firm foundation it won't stand the storms right but if it's but if it's a revelation if the if the spirit of god quickens the word to our hearts and makes it a revelation i mean then the it'll stand the storm it'll stand the test amen now if we have if if we have the presence of god then there's a certain atmosphere that goes with us but i was going to back up and say this brother brahm said he said in time of decision he says the angel of the lord accompanies the message always that's it that's the spirit of god in angelic form right i mean so so we must have the spirit of god in our lives this maybe you may think this is very elementary no because it's very important it's the most important thing i mean that that god lives in our lives like never before we need him more and more the difference but you know this jesus would give the parable of the wise and foolish virgins right they're all virgin clean living to the word right but only five had the oil only five had the oil and the ones that had the oil went into the marriage supper right the ones who did not they were without so the lord in this parable is saying that it's fundamental that we have the holy ghost right his presence goes with us amen not just that we step into his presence one time and then leave it but he goes with us on the journey i mean that he leads us because he says my presence will go with thee and i will give thee rest amen now jesus in in his last commission to the church now we're just jumping uh into the new testament there it says here and jesus would say in mark 16 he'd say after he would list out he would say and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel about me to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized is saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe so this is not just the apostles but it's to every believer down through the ages in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen right so the presence of god went with the believers in the first age amen confirming the word with science following amen and if we have been restored back to that age should should that not be happening with us as well i mean we're not all called to be preachers or apostles or you know pastors evangelists or teachers but the spirit of god should be with each and every one of us i mean confirming the word making it live hallelujah amen now brother brown was saying he must be born again speaking of the nature that's that that's been put within us but also speaks about god he also read this he says now what kind of a nature have you got then brother branham he says his nature see if god is in you you've got his divine nature if i had my father's nature then i'd do the things my father did but now that i'm born again it depends on who my father was if we're just born in the church you've got a church father and you can call him father if you want to you call him anything you want to because he's your father but if your father is god and you're born in the family of god seek those things that pertain to god that's right then you are god's child your nature is god's nature um then um then when some oh you hear them some say oh our church believes the days of miracles is past how could you believe the days of miracles was passed when the very nature of god is in you when he is altogether miracle his nature's miracle his habits miracle his whole being is miracle how can you be anything but miracle your new birth is miracle i mean things are dead this is right see you're a new creature a new creation sure amen so he says here that you know he is altogether miracle goddess i mean so if he goes with us i mean we should see his fingerprints in our lives i mean of the supernatural not just in signs and healings and wonders but in our character and because he's looking for a people who have his divine character amen now as i said before before i backtrack back to that i said you know if his presence is is in a place or in a person's life they have a different kind of an atmosphere amen and that atmosphere is the atmosphere of god now we can we can live in different atmospheres you know brother ram says that we bump into devils all the time we don't realize you know so we can be in a very dark atmosphere but i believe we're called to live in a very light atmosphere i'm in an atmosphere of the holy ghost that's where he wants you to dwell too by the way it's not just us longing to be in his presence he wants you in his presence amen and he's made a way for us to dwell in his presence forevermore i mean by his precious blood now now if you look at nature if you look at nature around the world based on the amount of water in those places there's different kind of wildlife amen in new zealand we've got predominantly rain forest there's a lot of rain there's a lot of big trees you don't see cactus growing here even on the desert road that ain't really desert you know i don't see how it's cool but i mean i guess maybe comparing to the rest of the country it's desert but it ain't desert amen compared to other parts of the world you go to the sahara that's desert right the desert road ain't there's it's sahara is desert okay but the reason is is because in the sahara there's not a lot of rain it does snow from time to time very rarely but the but the soil is so de great it's just sand there's nothing there to absorb the water and bring forth life and you go to different parts of the world where it's more dry there's things like cactus there's different kind of life because of the atmosphere it lives in very dry harsh climate right so now if you take that into the spiritual you can see what kind of atmosphere that we live in right because based on our nature and our character it depends on what kind of nature we live in now we know the scripture says that i believe psalms 1 that you know if we you know we'd be like a tree planted by the rivers of many water right so so people actually in the bible are likened unto trees right so the kind of condition that you live in will produce a certain life out of you amen so now brother man would saying god identifying himself by his characteristics and say i come from tucson where it's really good and dry and i come here and it's really good and wet so there's quite a contrast if you have got all um if you if you all got all the water over here and you send it over our way we'd appreciate it but of course you can't do it but i tell you one thing there's a parable there all the things in arizona are trees it's full of stickers everything has a sticker because it's dry now if some bush growth over here would be nice and lovely leaf see without it's without water that's the reason it becomes a sticker and when the church becomes without the water of life it gets dry and sticky too sticking and punching at everything but where the water of life flows it opens up the leaf and makes it tender mellow sweet holy acceptable unto the lord so may the lord god water us that we won't be stickers but we'll find leaves that wayward people may sit down under the tree of our shade and find rest to their souls why because the atmosphere is different it makes people different i mean you you take people who live very tense kind of hard you know stressful clown lives it's because there's an atmosphere there that creates it but you get those same people and you bring them under the presence of god it mallows them out it makes them sweet it makes them kind it makes them understanding it makes them gentle why because they're living in his presence where before they're not in his presence once your thing you walked out the presence of god is your carnal nature just flares up right but then you repent and god comes back because really god never leaves us we leave the lord we're the one who steps off the path he just keeps going on but i'm so thankful just a heart a real repentant heart he'll come back to where we are amen so now so so it's fundamental that the reason that we dwell in his presence is that it produces the character of the word in our lives i mean so we don't want to be full of stickers where we're just looking at each other's faults and we can't we can't bypass our you know different problems and things going on and everything's just a big issue and a problem we don't want to be like that no but we want to live in such a way now i'm not saying you're not living like this i just want to say there's such a great thing that his grace has come upon us so greatly that his presence is with us amen so we don't want to get ever in such a state where we can't overlook our brother or sister's faults amen and it's just everything we see is bad bad bad now when i look actually i see good good good i see the goodness and mercy of god i see his grace i see his redemption i see his mercy i see his forgiveness i mean i see the effect of his blood upon a people hallelujah where people have been sealed away from the wrath is to come amen our walking on the king's highway up into glory that's what i see i see redemption i see the apple of god's eye upon the earth amen i see those who are accepted in the beloved that's what i see that's what i see when i'm looking at you now that's what i see i see a people full of faith i see people that are rugged aiming were overcoming power it doesn't matter what the devil throws at them they're going to be steadfast and sure i mean if they fall they'll get back up amen and they'll be quick to repent amen they'll be quick to forgive i mean they'll overlook one another's faults amen they'll see the best in one another that's what i see when i see you amen i see a people amen made in his image amen hallelujah that's what i see you may see something different than me but just pray for me right but you know that's what i see i see a group that's going to march up into heaven we'll be part of that great big number around the throne amen we'll cast our crowns down at his feet and worship him forever more and hallelujah see him face to face and amen we need you we're you know each and every one of us goes and gets their reward we'll be cheering the loudest hallelujah hallelujah amen that's what i see amen i believe that's what we should see in one another amen we've been bought with a price we belong to him amen and he's going to see us through hallelujah amen i see a manifestation of the grace of god when i see you hallelujah amen hallelujah amen now brother brown would say in the presence of god unrecognized he says oh the greatest pleasure i know of is to pray until i realize i'm in the presence of god and recognize it i think that ought to thrill a little to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the holy spirit seeing god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it vindicated it ought to give faith and make cripples walk blind say deaf hear dumb speak i mean why does camp thrill us because the presence of god is there in such an incredible fashion i mean why do prayer meetings thriller so we come to church why does it thrill us because god comes down an incredible way hallelujah it's the thrill of the church it's my thrill amen amen to be in the presence of the one who purchased me being the prince the one who loves me with an unfailing love i mean the one who's ransomed me amen he's healed me he's redeemed he's leading me all the way to be in his presence that thrills my heart to be in the to be in the presence of the perfect one the sinless one the matchless one the great mighty conqueror to be in his presence is the greatest thing hallelujah amen now balaam would prophesy will try and prophesy against israel he'd be hired by the king of moab this is the numbers i think 22 to 25 and there and every time he would he would try and prophesy and and and get god to curse israel he couldn't do it he just blessed them and when when when balaam would would would speak under the inspiration when he looked down into israel he says in numbers 23 21 he says a few things in different places you can go away and read it he says numbers 23 21 he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob now this is god looking at his people this is god looking at israel now you've got to remember in that camp there's murmuring there's trouble there's sin there's complaining there's people happy sad mad and glad there's people annoyed at their neighbors they're people having bad days having good days you know people having bad years good years troubled years happy years all that's going on but when god looks down because remember this isn't this isn't balaam giving his his assessment of israel this is god giving his assessment this is what i see remember god sees everything we can't hide nothing from god we can hide things from one another you can't hide nothing from god i mean so here is balaam was this god speaking through him he says he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob i mean so when god looked down at jacob when god looked down at israel says i don't see any iniquity in them i mean neither have he seen perverseness in israel hallelujah this is god's this is god testifying of his people as their journey remember this is just under the blood of bulls and goats to magnify this 10 billion trillion times and this is how he sees you and i under the blood of jesus christ hallelujah the lord his god is with him amen that made a big difference between israel and the rest of the nations they were like anyone else they are human beings like anyone else but the big demarcation is that god was with them amen and that's a big demarcation i'd say between the real believer in the not believer i'm not putting anyone in any boxes that their god is with them hallelujah and the shout of a king is among them hallelujah i mean why was the shadow of a king among them because the presence of the king was among them i mean the word of god was among them amen that's why the shard of the king was among them hallelujah amen because remember god's purpose was to was to walk with his people that's why he called them out of egypt it wasn't just to deliver them from slavery i mean but he wanted to walk with them i mean he didn't want to be separated from there i want to be with them holly i want to walk with them i want to talk with them i want to have fellowship with them that's what he wants to do with you he wants to walk with you he wants to talk with you it was that fellowship with you he wants to know you and he wants you to know him oh that's what he wants that's why he died on calvary i want to walk with you i want to share my secrets i want to share my heart with you i want to express really what i feel about you hallelujah that's what he wants to do and this is what he's doing hallelujah remember it's not just our desire i want more of him it's not just our desire it's not one-way traffic the reason he puts that in our hearts for more of him is because he wants more of you oh it's not just one way you understand that we have a long a lot i want more i want to see you more i want to see your glory experience you more on my heart to be softer towards you even the slightest little nudge i'll turn oh my but the reason he does that is because he wants it amen and god's not a bully he doesn't put anything on anyone but he puts a longing hallelujah so remember we're not just crying out to a void and saying god i want more of you and there's no response there's a big response there's a big answer hallelujah amen hallelujah it's in leviticus 26 and 12 and i will walk among them and and will be your god and you shall be my people i am the lord your god that brought you forth out of the land of egypt that you should not be there bondmen and i have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright hallelujah that's what he's done for us under the bondage of sin he's broken our bands and they won't be stooped down in sin and perverse us and and and things of the world we can walk upright i mean we're the sons and daughters of the most high god i mean he's ransomed us with his blood he's purchased our salvation amen but he did that that he'd walk among us but now under the blood of bulls and goats he could only walk among them which is a tremendous thing if you think about it but under the blood of jesus christ that blood is so powerful it cleanses amen the heart of the believer the soul of the believer out that god himself steps in that's no longer just god with us but god in us amen as the apostle paul said christ in you the hope of glory not just christ with you i mean to have god with you is an incredible thing don't get me wrong i love that but to have christ in me amen that's what i desire and that's what god's desire was the joy set before him when he went up calvary that days i'm going to walk in them oh my want to look at his disciples that's incredible to know you this way but it's going to be far deeper than this amen i'm going to walk in you amen it won't be you walking alone you'll never walk alone because i will be in you i mean i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i mean he says in second corinthians 6 and 16 he says and i will dwell in them and walk in them and i'll be their god and they shall be my people oh hallelujah hallelujah one incredible thing this is what we're experiencing hallelujah this is not a promise that's in the future this is now i mean this is being fulfilled now for some of us it's been fulfilled for years hallelujah amen and the lord promised moses there he says my presence shall go with thee and i'll give thee rest hallelujah i'll give thee rest now that rest doesn't just speak of you know that rest there in the old testament actually spoke of being being taken into the promised land and we'll get into that soon but uh god would tell uh tell moses tell the israelites in exodus 23 and 20 behold i've i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring me into the place which i have prepared i go to prepare a place for you amen that where i am you shall be also i will come again and if i do go prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am you shall be also i mean so now when you parallel this into the new testament it's not just us leaving stokes valley and going to some other part of the earth that's not what it's talking about it's not leaving egypt physically and going to the promised land physically anymore but it's actually god is leading us here into glory amen amen so he says i'll send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring to bring thee into the place where i have prepared he says beware of him obey his voice provoke him not we know the voice is the word of god right provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i'll be an enemy unto thine enemies in an adversary unto thine adversaries amen so now this angel here is god in angelic form because his name is in him he says he will go before thee to bring me into the place which i have prepared right and he will and to keep thee in the way that's why it's so important to live in the presence of god because if you begin to step off the path the lord i trust on the inside will say oh no hold on this doesn't yeah it should be alarm bells going off don't look at that thing don't read that thing don't listen to that thing get off that website get off that video right don't look at that it should be lord i'm sorry you know because his presence remember he just like just like brother ed showed if you haven't listened to wednesday go listen to it but you know brother um ed put that video brother only describing when the holy ghost comes in and he takes over then your second nature goes instead of being in charge of you is just to a place of influence amen to me to me it's such a big difference between your nature leading you and god actually being your nature leading you then now that nature is just first nature is just an influence as opposed to ruling your life amen but itself god is on the control tower of your life amen what's that to do to keep the in the way to keep you in his word hallelujah amen to a place which i have prepared amen we're going up into glory hallelujah now the apostle paul and now just to save time we won't read it but you go away and you read hebrews three and four the apostle paul parallels israel coming out of egypt going into the promised land and he and and and he speaks about they would not enter god would would say to israel that first generation they won't enter into his rest because of unbelief now that rest we know is going into the promised land but then the apostle paul would say but there is a rest for the people of god it says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest now we know that that rest is not keeping a day right because in colossians it would say let no man therefore judge you and meet you and drink a respect of a holiday or of the new moons of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ so he's saying that the keeping the sabbath is just a shadow pointing to a reel right and then jesus would stand it i think it's in matthew 11. come unto me all you that heavy labor and a lady i'll give thee rest right they were sabbath keepers but they didn't have rest so the true rest is actually when you enter into when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's an eternal rest right where you cease from your own works is no longer you trying to be a christian it's him being the christian in you it's him fulfilling his word it's him producing his character in you amen so now when he says my presence will go with thee and i will give the rest what so to me now it's bringing us into the baptism of the holy ghost sure but it's actually taking us remember their final destination was the promised land our final destination is glory right that is that is if i can call it this way that is the rest if we parallel it into today that is the rest where he will bring us into right sure he'll bring us into an eternal rest we'll receive the holy ghost but the final end of our journey is the change of the body being taken up into glory so my presence will go with thee and i will give thee the rapture amen hallelujah because we are living in the time of the third exodus the first exodus was then going going from egypt into the promised land the second exodus was when jesus was here going from being dead and trespassed sins into the living god receiving the holy ghost and now the third exodus is being filled with the holy ghost and take it up into a rapture amen hallelujah praise the lord now i love it where the lord says unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name now when you think of this i know there by name amen it brought me automatically into john 10 where jesus says i am the i'm the shepherd hallelujah now he would he would jesus would lay out this parable here and oh we can go to john 10 we're not going to read the whole chapter but maybe just just just put it up here but i trust that by the end of the service you just rejoice saying god's with me he's not just with me he's in me and he's not just in me just to be in me he's leading me amen and he's keeping me and he's protecting me and he's guiding me he's showing me the way and hallelujah so so here it is here i mean and we've got john 1 and sorry john 10 and verse 1. verily verily i send you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him that the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out see he said to moses i know thee by name and jesus knows his sheep by name he knows us by name i mean we're not just a a a number we're not just a number this is not how this works you know we he knows us by name you know brother brown would tell the story of when i think it was king george winter went to canada you know you know on a royal tour tour as they did and you know so so i think it's vancouver or some some big city you know he's in his carriage or in a car and he's going down the streets and people were packing the sides they're waving uh you know the union jack and screaming and shouting and you know the schools were emptied out everyone was there on the street and you know finally the school because they went there and they saw him go past they waved their flags and they went back to school but then they did a roll call and there was one girl who wasn't there and you're so so so they're panicking wondering what happened to her and they begin to go back to the you know part of the street where they're lined up and they found her down in alleyway hidden away just crying in the corner somewhere and the teacher picked her up and said honey you know what happened you know are you okay you heard or something and you know and and you know but you know no no i'm okay yeah well what happened you know did you wave your flag yeah i waved my flag did you cry out long live king george or whatever yeah i did all that well then what's the problem you know well i waved my flag and i cried out but did he see me she was so upset because she because she's just a little fella and there's other people in front of her and you know couldn't the king couldn't see you now when we wave our little flag and we praise god and we pray and give thanksgiving to god we don't need to be worried does he see me no his eye's on the sparrow and i know he watches me amen he knows me by name i'm just not just a number i'm not just part of the crowd i am amen i am his attention i am i am the affection of his love i i am the apple of his eye not just everyone else but me hallelujah why because this is an individual walk it's not just a show we're a body but it's individual amen and we're all important to god we're not just a a a a nameless face in the crowd never ever get that in never ever allow the devil to tell you that that you're not important that no one cares that god doesn't care that you don't know god cares he cared so much for you went to calvary for you amen he cares a lot he cares so much for you that you'll take a rapture amen he sent malachi 4 in this age to turn your heart back to the faith of the fathers amen to walk with him god cares jesus cares amen and when he put it forth and when he put forth his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers now we won't read it but the same time the lord jesus makes a differentiation between a shepherd and a heiling amen a heiling runs when there's trouble but a shepherd lays his life down for the sheep he stands in the way amen he protects them i mean he takes care of any danger but a heiling runs the first side of trouble he's gone he says my peg this is well above my pay grade i'm out of here right because he's a hireling he's not the shepherd right but a true shepherd lays his life down for the sheep and he says i am the good shepherd amen and i know my sheep and are none of mine so what he's saying is that when danger because i'm the good shepherd when danger comes i'm not running and it doesn't matter if all of hell comes against you god doesn't say oh this is too hot and heavy tell me how it goes and he runs no no he stands he actually blocks between you and the devil amen he is not there to run he's not a heiling he's telling you i'm not going to leave you no matter how bad how how terrible a situation may be i'm not gonna leave you but i'll be with you in the trouble i'll be with you in the storm i will guide you through the storm hallelujah because he says that he leads his sheep hallelujah amen remember because the shepherd in the bible we've just read it but i just want to show you a shepherd in the bible is not like a modern day shepherd a monday shepherd you get all the sheepdogs right i've done it i was yeah big did it with my uncle and my friends and stuff you get all the sheep dogs get on the quad you go to where the sheep are you you know set the dogs free they begin to whistle into all kinds of things and they drive the sheep to where they want them to go so the shepherd is actually behind the sheep but in the bible he says the shepherd leads his sheep the shepherd always goes on before amen he always goes on before and that's why now david could say in psalms 23 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters right he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake for his namesake he has you in his hand hallelujah because he can't be defeated amen god's not going to lose one of his children i mean his purpose cannot be defeated i mean i believe i'm part of him amen if i'm part of him i'm not going to be lost hallelujah i'm going to be in heaven hallelujah but you see but but moses moses said i want to know i found grace in my sight you know and god says i'll prove it because my presence will be with you amen so he lead so so david david had a shepherd and and and the lord led him this way and he says yea thou walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil now a harling would have quit are you going through the valley shall death oh no no they said no i'll fear no evil for thou art with me amen thy rod and they staff they comfort me so we've got to realize the shepherd is with us the shepherd now please take it please take this incredibly personal right don't just take it as the church no the church is made up of individuals who know the lord and the lord knows them and the lord walks in them amen and manifests his word through their life right so take this very personal amen the lord he says i will fear no evil because thou art with me hallelujah so now just as he says the lord leads me amen he leadeth me beside the still waters he leads me in the past of righteousness don't you think that when we go through the valley of the shadow of death don't you think actually the lord is leading us there right don't you think that he he doesn't just lead us part of the time he's a 24 7 leader i mean when we're asleep he's leading us when we're awake he's leading us when we don't know which way up and down we need that third coffee he's leading us right he's in control when you don't know which way to go he's still leading so but the thing is god leads us into something it's never a death trap it's never a death trap he leads us into it seems to the very jaws of danger actually to remove our enemy amen he led he led israel down by the red sea israel saw a death trap actually you know the lord just had a a pharaoh trap right there or an egyptian trap that wasn't a death trap for israel that was a death trap for israel's enemy hallelujah why so so they were literally walking down the valley of shadow of death because if god didn't stand behind them the you know the egyptian army would have come and massacred them and taken this some slaves back to egypt but it was a it was a death trap for egypt not for israel it was actually god allowed that to happen and if you go read the account moses is told by god go here go here go there you'll end up here so they weren't just doing a mad dash somewhere and they ended up there and all how did we get here no god led them that way because he leads right he doesn't just send he leads he sure he may commission us and send us into the world but when we go he leads us hallelujah he doesn't just give us orders and then and then now i want my six monthly report how's it going no he's leading us every day hallelujah so so he led he led them there amen not just to leave them there but to take them through that the egyptians would be drowned right daniel daniel was led by the lord daniel had a shepherd hallelujah and and and the great shepherd actually led daniel into a lion's den that wasn't to destroy daniel the lion's den was to destroy daniel's enemies other because remember after daniel got hauled out of the den then the king said now all you people and all your family and all that you are throw them in amen so so the voices of daniel's accusers were silenced amen in the same den that the lord led him into hallelujah you say well the devil's on my case don't you worry god's leading you into a devil death trap amen there may be some great pressure in your life don't worry stay close to the shepherd amen he will take you through for a death trap for the devil hallelujah so everything's working for your good it's not working for the devils good and i'm happy about that hallelujah so now we can we can rest in the fact that it doesn't matter if we're we're we're laying down in green pastures or besides still waters or in paths of righteousness oh we're going through the valley of the shadow of death amen he's with us and we shall fear no evil so don't fear nothing in this world amen hallelujah amen if god before us who can be against us amen so our lord jesus is our real shepherd and he's proved it over and over again and he doesn't run from trouble and abandons us but he leads us through every situation hallelujah amen of god so what can we say to these things so now if the lord is leading us through every situation then what do we have to complain about what have we to fear just stick close to the shepherd and when trouble comes i mean stick close the shepherd when trouble comes remember here's the word right so how do you stick close to the shepherd when trouble comes well read the word ponder the word talk about it testify about it sing about it listen to it believe it and confess it right let let the meditations of your heart be upon him in the time of trouble amen because what does that do that builds faith because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god remember worry and fear just rip strips your faith right but the word lifts your faith hallelujah that's why that's how you stick close to the shepherd amen hallelujah no brother brown would tell a story uh uh give an account where where where um he actually woke up one morning the devil was standing in the corner and he looked like some cartoon character i can't remember who it was but um off top of my head but this devil is saying to him you have no power with god and you've got nothing and and then and then brother brown just said to him satan you're an offense to me get out of my way in the name of the lord jesus christ and the devil left because we have authority over the devil and he said i lay there a little bit and the bed started to raise up and i felt a real sweet feeling come over me i thought i wonder if the holy spirit now is close and over in the corner so help me here's my bible over my heart the sweetest voice i ever heard in my life said don't fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go he says that settle it with me let them rage i've got an absolute my anchor holds yonder because it's the word of the living god amen i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee amen so now just real quickly i'm just going to wrap up with this now if his presence is with us and it's going to lead us all the way into the rapture then what orders presence ought to do now we've covered one it should make us sweet and gentle and loving and kind all the future the spirit should be growing right we're in his presence right but now brother brown preached a sermon called the presence of god unrecognized but what about when the prince of god is recognized let's just take the vice versa amen now let's let's look into this now it's interesting that many people have different terminologies right the world is full of and then many disagreements are based on because my glossary index is different to yours right so when you say born again or baptism your definition will be different to mine but we can be talking about the same thing now so we want to talk about the bible terminology of it brother brown even said and why it had to be shared but he said now i know the terminologies of what born again is but let's just watch what happened in the bible when they were born again and then he goes to peter he was a believer the apostles were believers but they weren't born again till after the holy ghost fell on them at pentecost right that gave them the new birth that's the bible terminology of it okay so we should look into the scripture and say what happens when the presence of god is recognized hallelujah now okay so what happens when the prince of god is recognized i'm just taking these from the new testament but the god of the oldest is the same god of the new right so when his presence is recognized he gives revelation amen peter recognized it was the presence of god he says thou art the christ the son of the living god i mean upon this rock i'll build my church amen that revelation gave a real anchor to whom shall we go thou alone have the words of eternal life if i all these other religious movements have their word their opinion but you have the word of eternal life so when his presence was recognized more than a prophet but god and man right he was the god prophet i mean when his presence was recognized it gave revelation and that revelation got a real anchor in his heart paul on the road to damascus stepped into his presence hallelujah and he you know that light shone about him and and paul would say who art thou lord and the lord said i'm jesus whom they persecuted what a moment that must have beat and it would never have escaped him hallelujah so what it gave revelation that the one he was fighting against was the very one that is claiming to serve amen amen he gives deliverance he gives deliverance when his presence is recognized amen the syrophoenician woman recognized it oh thou son of david o lord have mercy upon me amen and and and her faith went past all the discoursement everything amen and her faith because she recognized the presence of god amen caused her daughter that was demon-possessed to be delivered hallelujah amen when his presence is recognized he gives healing amen the woman with the blood issue if i ever just touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole hallelujah the crippled man loaded into his presence aiming by his friends they took the roof off the place and loaded him in they lowered him into his presence hallelujah and his sins were forgiven and he took up his bed and he walked hallelujah he raised the dead amen he called lazarus from the grave hallelujah this is just a few you can just go through the scripture amen he fills with the holy ghost that with one heart one mind one to call in the day of pentecost and then the prince of god came into the room and they realized we've been in this presence before hallelujah and they are filled with the holy ghost amen transform their lives why because his presence was recognized amen in his presence honest hearts realize their condition amen simon peter was fishing and jesus was there and then jesus called you know have you not have you caught anything caught nothing three units on the other side now forgive me if i've got these stories mixed up because i've just got this scripture here and when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knee saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for the for he was astonished and and all that were with them at the draw draft of the fishes which they had taken so peter recognized this is a different kind of a man amen and it made him realize his his condition that he wasn't worthy to be in his presence and he was a sinful man but god called him god didn't want him to depart he wanted him to stay amen hallelujah first uh chronicles 16 27 glory and honor are in his presence right this is from the old testament strength and gladness are in his place and psalm 6 11 thou will show me the path of life and my presence is
