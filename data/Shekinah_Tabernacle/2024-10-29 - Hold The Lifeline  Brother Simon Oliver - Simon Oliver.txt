[Music] [Music] we wonder we plan we live our life with the best of intentions we hard times and strife and wonder what went wrong we try and we try to figure it out to work out a plan Hold Your Hand high till your hand hits the line hold the lifeline never let go through Darkness HS and snow the lifeline will lead you home will lead you [Music] home we step out on the Water full of faith hope and Ambitions when the waves rise higher we look around and then we fold turn look to his face Hold Your Hand high and walk through ditches hilltops and pains the lifeline it leads to him hold the lifeline never let go through Darkness Hills and snow the lifeline will lead you home home will lead you [Music] home I fell into darkness deep Despair and [Music] depression took me to a place I never thought I would go life thick and dark I was lost wanding this world but God took my hand I'll never let go hold the lifeline [Music] never let go through Darkness Hills and snow the lifeline will lead you home it will lead you hold the lifeline will never let go through dark Hills and snow the lifeline will lead to him it will lead you home [Applause]
