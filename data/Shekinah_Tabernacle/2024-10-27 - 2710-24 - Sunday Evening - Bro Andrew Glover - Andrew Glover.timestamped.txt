[12:47] atmosphere where the spirit of God is
[12:51] and it's been so nice up here listening
[12:54] to all the voices sing back I don't know
[12:56] if you've ever been on this end of it
[12:59] but it's an amazing experience just to
[13:01] hear the Brethren worship God and it's
[13:04] like a like we get a we get a 300 200
[13:08] 300 person choir singing back to us and
[13:09] it sounds absolutely amazing I I'm
[13:12] thinking what heaven would be like with
[13:15] all the angels
[13:16] singing you know one one older brother
[13:20] said something and I I happened to not
[13:22] disagree with him he said the most
[13:24] amazing instrument ever is the human
[13:27] voice you know there's nothing can match
[13:29] it because no other instrument can
[13:34] express from their heart like the human
[13:38] voice can the guitar just makes makes a
[13:41] tune that someone else plays but this
[13:43] this throat of yours and mine it makes a
[13:45] tune it sings what our heart thinks you
[13:48] know and I and it's been wonderful
[13:50] singing and praising with you all and to
[13:52] hear the singing and praising that comes
[13:54] from each and every one of your hearts
[13:57] and uh the Lord you know he hears our
[14:00] heart but he also then he then when he
[14:02] hears the voice too I think it goes up
[14:03] as a a nice offering to the Lord so
[14:05] we're looking forward to a great time in
[14:07] the Lord um this evening I I believe the
[14:09] Lord's going to pour out his spirit in a
[14:11] powerful way continue to pour out his
[14:12] spirit in a powerful way so we're

[56:12] few moments in the word of the Lord if
[56:13] you have your Bibles we want to go to
[56:15] the Book of Romans the 8th chapter The
[56:18] Book of Romans the 8th chapter and just
[56:21] a few things here tonight on our heart
[56:23] we pray will be a blessing to you and
[56:26] Romans chapter 8 and verse number 11
[56:30] it's a very very familiar scripture to
[56:32] the Eagles and the Believers of this end
[56:34] time word but here the Bible says but if
[56:37] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[56:41] from the dead dwell in you then he that
[56:45] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[56:48] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[56:52] spirit that dwelleth in you maybe we
[56:55] just read that together Romans 8:11 but
[56:58] if the spirit of him that raised up
[57:00] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[57:03] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[57:06] also Quicken your moral bodies by his
[57:08] spirit that dwelleth in you we ask Lord
[57:11] this evening to add the blessing to the
[57:13] reading of his word as you can have your
[57:15] seats here this afternoon I want to by
[57:17] the help of the Lord for a few moments
[57:19] from that passage of scripture if I
[57:21] would take a title tonight I want to
[57:23] talk to you on this we must not lose our
[57:27] enthusiasm we must not lose our
[57:31] enthusiasm I want to begin by saying
[57:34] that I believe the enthusiasm of an age
[57:37] is the message of that age in 1965
[57:40] brother BR preaches two very powerful
[57:42] sermons and both of these sermons are
[57:45] centered around the subject of
[57:47] quickening power he will preach the
[57:50] sermon the Easter seal and then he will
[57:52] preach the sermon it is the rising of
[57:54] the sun now I'm in my fa and title from
[57:57] that sermon the Easter seal in paragraph
[58:00] 47 he said now as Christians we all
[58:03] claim he is alive or we've been
[58:05] quickened from Death To Life by his
[58:07] Spirit he said if we haven't been
[58:10] quickened then we've not been made alive
[58:12] he said now we're going to break into
[58:14] this subject the Lord willing kind of
[58:15] teach it for a few moments he said how
[58:18] that are we quickened and can we be sure
[58:21] that this is the truth he said now this
[58:23] is your own life this is my life and if
[58:26] this isn't the truth what I'm fixing to
[58:28] say then I'm one of the most foolish
[58:30] people in the world he says I've give my
[58:33] life for something there's nothing to
[58:35] and so have you but if it is the truth
[58:38] he said then I owe everything that I am
[58:41] I owe everything I could be to the cause
[58:43] of which we're standing for he says and
[58:46] I think that we mustn't lose our
[58:49] enthusiasm amen I think that we mustn't
[58:52] lose our enthusiasm you know I'll say
[58:55] this thank God a Vindicated Prophet that
[58:57] has come among the church who has not
[58:59] preached things from an unbalanced view
[59:02] amen but he has brought a balance to
[59:04] every subject in which he would present
[59:06] to the church now in 1950 believest thou
[59:09] this he said now I would rather have a
[59:12] little enthusiasm amen than no ASM at
[59:15] all amen amen just to have somebody get
[59:18] enthused about it brother BR makes a
[59:20] statement again 1958 he said the church
[59:23] today has lost its enthusiasm he said
[59:26] why because it has got out of the vine
[59:29] he said it's no more being energized by
[59:31] the spirit Wells of water bubbling up
[59:34] into everlasting life he said they've
[59:36] lost that Zeal something is missing he
[59:39] said but if God Remains the Same and
[59:42] Christ Remains the Same he said but his
[59:45] church has disassociated itself amen
[59:48] with his connection which is the vine or
[59:51] the spirit listen I believe that the
[59:53] holy spirit of God Amen is the s force
[59:56] of zeal and energy and enthusiasm amen
[59:59] that is in the Church of the Living God
[1:00:02] brother said now have you noticed
[1:00:03] today's crop have you noticed today what
[1:00:05] we do he said we got enough God about us
[1:00:07] to we come up on the platform and say
[1:00:10] yes maybe I better come up now this is
[1:00:12] the experience of it worldwide he said
[1:00:14] yes I better go up and stand and say
[1:00:16] well well I don't know here I am see huh
[1:00:19] what a place to be amen there's no fire
[1:00:22] burning there's no enthusiasm amen
[1:00:24] there's not a go into it now listen to
[1:00:27] The Prophet there's no fire burning
[1:00:29] there's no enthusiasm there is not a go
[1:00:32] into it amen and as an evangelist that
[1:00:35] just kills me to see God's people in
[1:00:37] that shape amen we are supposed to be on
[1:00:41] fire the brother B was saying that there
[1:00:43] is no Zeal or there is no fire or there
[1:00:46] is no burden or there is no passion Amen
[1:00:49] to go into it now you all know that
[1:00:51] brother brandom in 1961 had a vision
[1:00:54] amen and in the vision he was standing
[1:00:56] on the map of Palestine he says in that
[1:00:59] Paradox 61 he said in that Vision I was
[1:01:02] 2third of the way there he said and I
[1:01:04] looked across and there was the Jordan
[1:01:07] he said but on the other side of the
[1:01:09] Jordan he said there's where all the
[1:01:10] promises were laying I want you to think
[1:01:13] about something he had already come amen
[1:01:15] 2third of the way there it doesn't take
[1:01:18] a scientist to realize he had already
[1:01:20] come amen two pulls of a three-pool
[1:01:23] Ministry amen but notice the promises
[1:01:26] were not laying in the first
[1:01:28] pool they were not laying in the second
[1:01:30] pool amen but all the promises that
[1:01:33] belong to the bride amen was laying in
[1:01:36] the third pool so a prophet said see
[1:01:38] we've got to have an enthusiasm amen or
[1:01:41] a fire or a Zeal amen that will cause us
[1:01:44] to go into it brother said see people
[1:01:47] misunderstand this enthusiasm they
[1:01:49] misunderstand today he said they
[1:01:52] misunderstand the power of the Holy
[1:01:53] Spirit they just call it a bunch of Holy
[1:01:56] Rollers or a bunch of people amen that
[1:01:58] ain't got their right mind they
[1:02:00] misunderstand amen that you had to lose
[1:02:02] what you call your right mind amen
[1:02:05] because you can't have the mind of
[1:02:06] Christ in you and your right mind he
[1:02:09] said you can't have the mind of the
[1:02:11] world Amen and the mind of Christ at the
[1:02:14] same time amen one of them is carnal and
[1:02:17] the other is spiritual he that walks
[1:02:19] after the flesh is carnal but he that
[1:02:21] walks after the spiritual is spiritual
[1:02:24] amen so I will lose Lose Myself amen and
[1:02:27] find it Lord in thee he said so God is
[1:02:31] misunderstood now that's a very powerful
[1:02:33] statement amen that God is misunderstood
[1:02:36] he said it's not you that's
[1:02:38] misunderstood amen it's the Holy Spirit
[1:02:41] making you do that amen that they
[1:02:44] misunderstand amen they're not speaking
[1:02:46] against you amen they are speaking
[1:02:49] against him listen so when God comes
[1:02:52] upon you Amen to believe the word and by
[1:02:55] the word in your heart being quickened
[1:02:57] it brings a reaction to the word of
[1:02:59] faith amen and you just say Amen or
[1:03:01] hallelujah or however you respond to the
[1:03:04] word amen and people say well that's a
[1:03:06] Holy Roller or that's just an emotional
[1:03:09] person no they're not misunderstanding
[1:03:11] you amen they are misunderstanding the
[1:03:14] god that is on the inside of you that is
[1:03:17] causing you to respond to the word in
[1:03:20] the manner that you respond when I think
[1:03:22] of that word enthusiasm amen Webster
[1:03:24] says that enthus ASM is a strong
[1:03:27] excitement of feeling amen it is
[1:03:30] something that is inspiring it is a Zeal
[1:03:33] it is a fervor now I want you to hear
[1:03:35] this it is a belief in special
[1:03:38] Revelations of the Holy Spirit listen
[1:03:41] that didn't come from a message preacher
[1:03:44] that didn't come from a Bible commentary
[1:03:46] that is Webster's definition of the word
[1:03:49] enthusiasm is there would be a belief
[1:03:52] Amen in special Revelations that would
[1:03:55] be brought by the Holy Ghost now in John
[1:03:57] chapter 1 the Bible said that Jesus
[1:03:59] chose his disciples and he chose one by
[1:04:02] the name of Phillip brother said after
[1:04:04] Phillip got converted he was all
[1:04:07] enthused because in any man when he
[1:04:09] finds Jesus and gets saved amen there is
[1:04:13] an enthusiasm he said you got to be born
[1:04:16] again and when you're born there is an
[1:04:18] enthusiasm that rises amen with that
[1:04:21] birth it sets the soul of fire it takes
[1:04:25] all the difference es away and the isms
[1:04:27] and come straight to Calvary and
[1:04:30] recognizes Christ with the Burning Love
[1:04:33] and Zeal amen for the lost and Fallen
[1:04:35] World listen if you get a church birth
[1:04:38] you won't have any enthusiasm if you get
[1:04:41] a denominational birth you will not have
[1:04:44] any enthusiasm but if you get the birth
[1:04:46] of John the third chapter that would
[1:04:48] come by the water and the blood and the
[1:04:51] spirit then there will be an enthusiasm
[1:04:54] that will be birth from the dep of your
[1:04:56] soul and that enthusiasm will burn when
[1:04:58] you're on the mountain it will burn when
[1:05:01] you're in the valley it will burn when
[1:05:03] you're sick it will burn when you're
[1:05:04] well oh Church of the Living God I think
[1:05:07] it's time to come back Amen to the
[1:05:10] authority of the birth of the word of
[1:05:12] Jesus Christ listen and that birth tells
[1:05:15] me no matter where I am or what I'm
[1:05:17] going through I am still a Son of
[1:05:21] God sometimes I just like to tell the
[1:05:23] devil Amen on my good day days I'm a Son
[1:05:26] of God and on my bad days I'm a Son of
[1:05:29] God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Son
[1:05:31] of God and when I'm in the Valley I'm a
[1:05:34] Son of God when I feel God I'm a Son of
[1:05:37] God and when I don't feel God I'm a Son
[1:05:40] of God listen my condition does not
[1:05:43] dictate my seed it don't matter if I'm
[1:05:45] in the hospital I'm a Son of God if I'm
[1:05:48] broke I'm a Son of God Amen I am not a
[1:05:51] son of God based on what's happening to
[1:05:54] me in time I I am a Son of God based on
[1:05:57] what God did in eternity before I ever
[1:06:00] came into
[1:06:02] time my when he comes in the fullness of
[1:06:05] his power he will come exactly the way
[1:06:08] he come on the day of Pentecost there
[1:06:10] will not be one thing different there
[1:06:13] will be an enthusiasm that will burn in
[1:06:15] your heart that'll make you so happy and
[1:06:18] full of joy amen till you will stagger
[1:06:21] like you were full of strong drink now
[1:06:24] think about that amen for the scripture
[1:06:26] said be not drunk upon strong drink
[1:06:29] which biteth like an adder and stingeth
[1:06:31] like a serpent amen but be ye drunk on
[1:06:35] the spirit and I read that definition
[1:06:38] brother Ben amen that that that
[1:06:40] enthusiasm is a belief in special
[1:06:44] Revelations of the Holy Spirit I'm sorry
[1:06:47] but I'm just the guy amen that when I
[1:06:49] read that amen I got to go find some
[1:06:51] more on it so I begin to study the
[1:06:54] history of the word enthusiasm listen to
[1:06:57] this it may come as a surprise to many
[1:07:00] people when they first Look up the word
[1:07:03] enthusiasm to see that its original
[1:07:05] meaning has to do with the passion for
[1:07:08] religion it is rather than passionate or
[1:07:11] eager in interest in general a brief
[1:07:14] explanation of the word chalogy should
[1:07:17] clear this up enthusiasm centered the
[1:07:20] English language around the beginning of
[1:07:22] the 17th century it was borrowed from
[1:07:26] the Greek word eus meaning the
[1:07:29] inspiration or The Possession by God
[1:07:32] listen to this for the first 200 years
[1:07:35] or so it was used in English enthusiasm
[1:07:38] was primarily employed to refer to
[1:07:41] beliefs or passions that related to
[1:07:45] religion but by the beginning of the
[1:07:47] 18th century however the word begin to
[1:07:50] describe having strong feelings amen or
[1:07:53] interest in secular matters when I read
[1:07:56] that amen Something quickened in My
[1:07:58] Heart amen that the world took
[1:08:00] enthusiasm from us we didn't take it
[1:08:03] from
[1:08:04] them come on the first people to get
[1:08:06] infused wasn't at a ball game the first
[1:08:09] people to get infused was not at a rock
[1:08:12] and roll concert but according to
[1:08:14] history the first people to get enthused
[1:08:17] was people who met God in the power of
[1:08:19] his resurrection and there was a joy and
[1:08:22] there was a Zeal listen if a bunch of De
[1:08:25] can get infused about a basketball game
[1:08:28] or a soccer game and don't tell me the
[1:08:31] Church of the Living God ain't got a
[1:08:33] right to get excited about the message
[1:08:36] of the hour listen we didn't take it
[1:08:38] from them they took it from us so if I
[1:08:41] get a little bit infused don't get mad
[1:08:44] at me I'm just doing what I was born to
[1:08:47] do I was born to enjoy the salvation of
[1:08:50] my soul I was born to enjoy the liberty
[1:08:54] and the authority of the Holy Ghost my
[1:08:58] Amen in just in just one century amen
[1:09:01] the world changed the meaning of
[1:09:05] enthusiasm now you all know that what
[1:09:07] happens in the natural amen also happens
[1:09:10] in the spiritual brother said when the
[1:09:12] church lost its enthusiasm it also lost
[1:09:15] its sincerity he said now the sincerity
[1:09:18] we don't have it it seems to be a small
[1:09:20] interest he said it should be in a time
[1:09:24] of this Jubilee right now we are
[1:09:27] positive these things it should be that
[1:09:29] street porch would be buzzing like a
[1:09:31] buzz all the jail shouldn't be full they
[1:09:34] should be hanging out of Windows amen
[1:09:36] they should be preaching the gospel he
[1:09:38] said the street corners ought to be full
[1:09:40] of men and women testifying to the power
[1:09:43] of God he said yet we believe it we say
[1:09:46] but we've lost the sincerity and the
[1:09:49] enthusiasm that is to receive it he said
[1:09:52] now that's the truth and will never come
[1:09:54] back until we come down to that spot of
[1:09:58] appreciation of God for making a way for
[1:10:00] us listen the appreciation of God that
[1:10:03] he made a way for us but then he called
[1:10:06] us into the way he made and he
[1:10:08] Vindicated it to us by his spirit and by
[1:10:11] his word that is the Assurance amen that
[1:10:15] we have listen we were born in sin we
[1:10:18] were shapen in iniquity and we come in
[1:10:21] the world speaking lies in case you
[1:10:23] don't know you were born in the darkest
[1:10:25] of seven Gentile ages it was so dark
[1:10:29] that when a prophet drew it out on the
[1:10:30] wall amen he put a total blackness in
[1:10:33] there because he could see no light
[1:10:35] listen but yet God who is rich in Mercy
[1:10:39] who could not forsake his seed he said I
[1:10:42] will come down and I will make a way of
[1:10:45] Escape amen for my seed Amen to escape
[1:10:48] the age of Darkness listen friends I
[1:10:51] have not forgot that without this
[1:10:53] message I would be on my road to
[1:10:55] tribulation I have not forgot that
[1:10:58] without this message we would be headed
[1:11:00] for a devil's Hil and a sinner's grave
[1:11:03] but God who is rich in Mercy has
[1:11:05] fulfilled the promise of his word when
[1:11:08] he said I will make a way of escape and
[1:11:10] I will prepare a way in the wilderness
[1:11:13] listen friends the message of the hour
[1:11:15] amen ought to be received amen with
[1:11:17] appreciation it ought to be received
[1:11:19] with sincerity and it ought to have an
[1:11:22] enthusiasm that will burn behind it yes
[1:11:25] sir he said the message of the hour now
[1:11:27] I'll just say this the message of the
[1:11:29] hour amen has restored amen the element
[1:11:32] of sincerity to the church the Bible
[1:11:35] says in 1 Corinthians 5 it says Purge
[1:11:37] out therefore the old Leen that she may
[1:11:40] have a new lump that you may be a new
[1:11:42] love rather as you are in leaven for
[1:11:44] even Christ Our Passover Lamb is
[1:11:47] sacrificed for us look at this word leav
[1:11:50] it is entrenched mental and moral
[1:11:53] corruption it is viewed in its tend tcy
[1:11:55] to infect others leaven is applied to
[1:11:58] that which amen though small in quality
[1:12:01] or quantity rather but yet by its
[1:12:04] influence it thoroughly pervades a thing
[1:12:07] it is either a good sense in the parable
[1:12:09] of Matthew 13:33 or in a bad sense amen
[1:12:13] of a pernicious influence listen a
[1:12:16] little leav leth a whole lump so when
[1:12:19] you start changing parts of this message
[1:12:21] though you just change a little bit and
[1:12:24] you just add a little bit to it or you
[1:12:26] take a little bit away from it amen you
[1:12:28] are opening the door amen for the leav
[1:12:31] of the devil Amen to pervade the entire
[1:12:35] church the Bible said therefore let us
[1:12:38] keep the feast amen not with o 11
[1:12:40] neither with the leaven of malice and
[1:12:42] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[1:12:45] of sincerity and Truth amen so that
[1:12:48] tells me that the feast or the or the or
[1:12:51] the place that we've been called to amen
[1:12:53] is not just anything
[1:12:55] but it is a spiritual Feast with the
[1:12:57] Lord now brother B comes along and says
[1:12:59] some people they make the gospel a
[1:13:01] funeral procession he said they go to
[1:13:03] church like it was a funeral procession
[1:13:06] he said but then others they make it a
[1:13:07] Frolic he said some of them make it a
[1:13:10] Frolic just a big time to go play a
[1:13:12] bunch of music jump up and down on a
[1:13:14] platform Dance all over the platform or
[1:13:16] down the aisle run and sit down and talk
[1:13:18] about their neighbor he said that's
[1:13:20] right and then some of them thinks they
[1:13:22] ought to stand amen and say the doxology
[1:13:24] and the Apostles Creed he said I want
[1:13:27] somebody to show me the thing written in
[1:13:29] the Apostles Creed I believe in the Holy
[1:13:32] Roman Catholic Church he said I don't or
[1:13:35] they say I believe in communion of
[1:13:36] saints he said that is spiritualism he
[1:13:39] said but they're so busy making those
[1:13:41] things up that they make it a funeral
[1:13:44] procession how many thankful for a
[1:13:46] prophet he said it's not a funeral
[1:13:48] procession and neither is it a Frolic
[1:13:52] amen but it is a feast with Christ when
[1:13:54] the Believers come and D listen this
[1:13:58] message is not a bunch of Frolic and
[1:14:00] neither is it an icicle amen this
[1:14:03] message is a feast on the bread of his
[1:14:06] presence by the revelation of his word
[1:14:09] then I say this is a church I believe
[1:14:11] there are some things amen that we can
[1:14:13] afford to lose is that okay amen can I
[1:14:16] just give you a few I believe we can
[1:14:18] afford to lose the cold the complacent
[1:14:21] and the critical Spirits I believe we
[1:14:23] can afford Amen to lose the formal
[1:14:26] spirits and the fussing spirits and the
[1:14:28] fighting Spirits you know I believe we
[1:14:30] can afford to lose the doubtful spirits
[1:14:32] and the dull spirits and the dead
[1:14:34] spirits but let me say it as plain as I
[1:14:37] know how there is one thing that we as
[1:14:40] the Church of the Living God cannot
[1:14:42] afford to lose and that is our
[1:14:44] enthusiasm and our
[1:14:47] sincerity in both sermons brother Ram
[1:14:50] preaches the Easter seal and the rising
[1:14:52] of the sun he takes his text from Romans
[1:14:54] 8 11 and says if the spirit of him that
[1:14:57] raised up Jesus from the dead amen dwell
[1:15:01] in you that he that raised up Christ
[1:15:03] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:15:06] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:15:08] dwelleth in you look at this word
[1:15:11] Quicken it means to be Gat or to Bear
[1:15:14] living young it means to restore to life
[1:15:17] it means to give increase of life it is
[1:15:20] of the spirit quickening as respects God
[1:15:23] have mercy it is the end doing with new
[1:15:26] and greater powers of
[1:15:28] Life metaphorically it is of seeds that
[1:15:32] are quickened into life amen example of
[1:15:35] germinating springing up or growing I
[1:15:38] love a prophet's words he said we did
[1:15:41] not become the seed amen by the rebirth
[1:15:44] amen we were seed and therefore were
[1:15:47] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:15:51] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:15:54] could be quickened because in nonseed
[1:15:57] there is nothing to Quicken listen if
[1:16:00] there's not a seed in your soul then
[1:16:02] there's not a potential amen for a birth
[1:16:05] that will bring a quickening power but
[1:16:07] if there is a seed in your soul then
[1:16:10] when the spirit of God begins to move
[1:16:12] there will be a dual sun rising in the
[1:16:15] last days he said the first Sun that
[1:16:17] Rose in Genesis it was bringing a
[1:16:19] message that there will be life upon the
[1:16:22] Earth and it'll be mortal life he said
[1:16:24] but this time when the sun rose there
[1:16:27] was a dual sunrising amen it was not
[1:16:30] only the Su and Rising but it was the s
[1:16:33] oen that had risen to bring eternal life
[1:16:37] to All God's promised seed that by forn
[1:16:40] knowledge he had seen laying upon the
[1:16:43] Earth my my my listen God was not
[1:16:47] surprised that not you give your heart
[1:16:49] back to him amen listen I believe that
[1:16:52] there is a marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:16:54] how many believes that I believe there's
[1:16:56] a table a th000 miles long where the
[1:16:58] redeemed of the Lord will set and they
[1:17:01] will partake of the merried supper of
[1:17:03] the lamb now I'm just going to have to
[1:17:05] be a little Cardinal here I can't help
[1:17:07] but think there ain't going to be tim
[1:17:08] tams at that
[1:17:10] supper I'll just be honest with you amen
[1:17:13] it don't matter how much of a diet you
[1:17:14] get on before you come down to New
[1:17:17] Zealand and you start getting them
[1:17:19] cookies in biscuits a are you with me
[1:17:22] amen amen but whatever is going to be
[1:17:24] there it's going be good but Lord if you
[1:17:26] can put some there put them there for me
[1:17:29] but but do you see amen there's a table
[1:17:32] and it's already ready set listen God
[1:17:35] didn't make your spot at the table the
[1:17:37] night you give your heart to God your
[1:17:39] seat was already put there listen God
[1:17:42] knows how many will be there he knows
[1:17:45] who will be there and there's not a
[1:17:47] question of whether they'll be there see
[1:17:49] because Jesus said he come to redeem or
[1:17:53] bring to life those predes destinated
[1:17:55] seed that God seen before the foundation
[1:17:58] of the world and put their names in The
[1:18:01] Book of Life and here they are on the
[1:18:03] earth without a hope but he came not
[1:18:06] only to be the blessing but to share the
[1:18:09] blessing with the every predestinated
[1:18:12] seed now if the seed wasn't in the earth
[1:18:15] it could not live it had to be on the
[1:18:17] earth no matter how long it kept in
[1:18:19] darkness it come forth when the S so n
[1:18:22] shines upon it he said notice he come
[1:18:26] Amen to share it with us listen Jesus or
[1:18:29] rather Paul speaking he says it will
[1:18:31] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:18:35] amen that dwelleth in you I want you to
[1:18:37] look at this word dwelleth it means to
[1:18:40] dwell in one and to influence him for
[1:18:43] the good now I want to say this Le
[1:18:45] influences for the good or the bad amen
[1:18:48] but quickening Power can only influence
[1:18:51] you for the good you say what is this
[1:18:53] quickening power it is God dwelling in
[1:18:57] the soul of The Believer by the power of
[1:19:00] the Holy Spirit I'll say tonight we are
[1:19:02] under amen the influence and the control
[1:19:06] of the quickening power of the Holy
[1:19:09] Ghost he says now we know what it done
[1:19:11] for him but I want you to see it not
[1:19:15] will it has done amen this Hallelujah it
[1:19:18] has done the same for you see what does
[1:19:21] it do it quickens the Mortal body that
[1:19:24] we live in in other words it brings it
[1:19:27] to
[1:19:28] life now you who once walked around with
[1:19:31] a great big cigar in your mouth and a
[1:19:33] bunch of cigarettes and you women once
[1:19:35] had short hair and you painted and
[1:19:37] carried on and wore shorts and things
[1:19:39] like that amen but all at once something
[1:19:41] screamed and you look down here and it
[1:19:44] was the word amen see it quickened and
[1:19:47] you said no more shorts for me no more
[1:19:50] liquor for me no more lying or stealing
[1:19:53] amen see the spirit that raised him from
[1:19:55] the dead dwelling in you will also bring
[1:19:58] your mortal bodies the dust of the earth
[1:20:01] into subjection you see what it is
[1:20:04] subjection to what Christ and who is
[1:20:07] Christ he is the word so the spirit of
[1:20:11] God is not bringing you subject to
[1:20:13] theology it is bringing you subject to
[1:20:16] the revelation of the word of God in the
[1:20:19] age you're living in if the spirit that
[1:20:21] raised up Jesus from the dead if it
[1:20:23] dwells in you oh Hallelujah it will
[1:20:26] Quicken your mortal body are y'all ready
[1:20:28] for this it'll make you do things you
[1:20:31] didn't do
[1:20:32] before well glory to God if quickening
[1:20:36] power ever comes in your soul it will
[1:20:38] move from your soul into the atmosphere
[1:20:41] of your flesh and it will make you do
[1:20:43] things you didn't do before if the
[1:20:46] spirit raised up Jesus from the dead I'm
[1:20:48] just reading you a few closer if that's

[1:20:52] mortal bodies because it's all already
[1:20:55] life and when it comes into your body it
[1:20:58] will bring your whole body subject to

[1:21:05] another place what does it do to our
[1:21:07] mortal bodies it turns our opinion it

[1:25:53] personel from some other country or a
[1:25:56] diplomat of some sort we would think it
[1:25:58] was a great thing to have such a noble
[1:26:00] person Among Us he said but today we

[1:26:27] your understanding how that you're still
[1:26:30] here but can I bring you to a word
[1:26:33] understanding it's not you it's the word
[1:26:36] that's dwelling in you
[1:26:38] richly come on Church you know if the
[1:26:41] devil had his way you would have been
[1:26:42] out a long time ago you know that do you
[1:26:45] know you are a Triune being do you know
[1:26:47] that you have a body you have a spirit
[1:26:50] and you have a soul do you know that
[1:26:52] every church has three kinds of
[1:26:53] believers y'all know that every church
[1:26:56] has three kinds of believers do you
[1:26:57] realize there's a makeb Believer there's
[1:26:59] an unbeliever and there's a real genuine
[1:27:02] believer can I bring that a little bit
[1:27:04] closer amen inside of every believer is
[1:27:07] three kinds of
[1:27:09] Believers inside of every believer
[1:27:11] sitting right here tonight is three
[1:27:13] kinds of Believers you say can you prove
[1:27:15] that I can do you know what your flesh
[1:27:17] is your flesh is an unbeliever your
[1:27:20] flesh is a hybrid product between an
[1:27:23] adulterous parent and the serpent that
[1:27:25] produced a that produced a wild man let
[1:27:27] let me just goe and say it your flesh is
[1:27:29] not saved it is a caber and it will
[1:27:32] never be saved it fights you every day
[1:27:35] listen it's your flesh that don't want
[1:27:37] to go to church it's your flesh that
[1:27:39] don't want to sing it's your flesh that
[1:27:41] don't want to pray it's your flesh that
[1:27:43] don't want to come subject to the word
[1:27:44] of God because your flesh is an
[1:27:47] unbeliever but if you move a little bit
[1:27:49] deeper there's a spirit do you know what
[1:27:51] your spirit is your spirit is a make
[1:27:54] believer if everything's going good
[1:27:56] there's no problems there's no
[1:27:58] situations you're soaring on cloud nine
[1:28:01] you're fellowshipping with the angels I
[1:28:03] mean you're too blessed to be stressed
[1:28:05] you're too anointed to be disappointed
[1:28:08] amen you had coffee with Gabriel and
[1:28:10] you're going to have lunch with Michael
[1:28:12] are you hearing me because your spirit
[1:28:14] is in the highs of Highs but let me show
[1:28:16] you amen get a bad report or get a bad
[1:28:19] phone call or let something happen and
[1:28:22] that Spirit that's in the highs of high
[1:28:24] in the matter of seconds will drop to
[1:28:26] the lows of
[1:28:28] lows because it's a make believer but
[1:28:31] why are you still here because
[1:28:33] underneath the unbeliever and underneath
[1:28:35] the make believer there is a soul and
[1:28:39] that soul is the real you that is what
[1:28:41] come predestinated from almighty God let
[1:28:44] me say this from my soul I believe this
[1:28:48] message from my soul I praise my maker
[1:28:51] from my soul I worship the god of my
[1:28:54] fathers from my soul I believe on my
[1:28:57] good days from my soul I go to church
[1:29:00] from my soul I preach from my soul
[1:29:03] because my
[1:29:05] soul is the real
[1:29:07] me Hallelujah the Bible said there is a
[1:29:11] spirit in man it is the inspiration of
[1:29:14] the almighty that giveth him
[1:29:16] understanding I love that word Spirit it
[1:29:18] is the spirit of Heaven it is impaling
[1:29:21] amen a prophet to utter instruction or
[1:29:23] warning
[1:29:24] morning that Spirit brother Taz it
[1:29:28] imparts a warlike energy job
[1:29:32] 328 that Spirit imparts a warlike energy
[1:29:36] listen it is an exe executive and
[1:29:39] administrative power now I want to say
[1:29:42] this the spirit of God within man will
[1:29:45] instruct man which is the spirit of
[1:29:48] truth that was prophesied to come
[1:29:50] Revelation Jesus Christ he says I want
[1:29:52] you to notice the symbols of Christ also
[1:29:55] in the Bible and here on Earth on the
[1:29:57] earth he was a prophet do you believe
[1:29:59] that a prophet is the word he said we
[1:30:02] know that the word Prophet means a
[1:30:05] Divine interpreter of the word see the
[1:30:08] Divine word is wrote and that Prophet
[1:30:12] has the Divine spirit of God within him
[1:30:15] so the Divine word is wrote and the
[1:30:18] prophet is a Divine revealer of the
[1:30:21] Divine word that has been wrote but the
[1:30:24] way he reveals it is by the Divine
[1:30:26] Spirit on the inside of him he said
[1:30:29] because he was called God see because he
[1:30:32] packed within him the word of God thus
[1:30:35] saith the Lord I love this therefore the
[1:30:38] word Prophet means his
[1:30:41] interpretation isn't to be mingled
[1:30:46] with now that's a pretty heavy one but a
[1:30:50] prophet means his interpretation isn't
[1:30:52] to be mingled with
[1:30:54] see if he says if there be one among you
[1:30:56] a spiritual or Prophet I the Lord will
[1:30:58] speak to him amen what he says comes to
[1:31:01] pass then hear him because I'm with him
[1:31:05] but if it doesn't come to pass then
[1:31:07] don't you hear him I haven't sent him
[1:31:10] that's the way you know it and then you
[1:31:11] see the Divine are y'all ready for this
[1:31:15] the Divine interpretation of the word
[1:31:18] has to coincide with this last
[1:31:20] Revelation to the church so a prophet is
[1:31:24] going to come and he's going to be
[1:31:26] packing the Divine word he's going to be
[1:31:28] a Divine revealer but he's going to be
[1:31:31] possessed with an enthusiasm from the
[1:31:34] Divine Spirit to reveal the symbols and
[1:31:37] when a prophet makes a declaration amen
[1:31:40] the revelation will cause the symbol to
[1:31:42] become a reality I don't have time to
[1:31:44] get into it but in the first seal
[1:31:46] brother B says it like this he says
[1:31:48] first it was with God he said then it
[1:31:50] was in symbol form he said then it was
[1:31:52] in reality form
[1:31:54] listen the only thing that can bring
[1:31:56] something from mind of God from symbol
[1:31:58] to reality is thus saith a prophet and a
[1:32:01] prophet has been in this generation we
[1:32:04] are not a people who are following
[1:32:06] symbols we have received the Divine
[1:32:10] interpretation or the reality of the
[1:32:12] symbol that is written in the word of
[1:32:14] God that's why God said I will dwell in
[1:32:17] them but listen church he didn't say he
[1:32:20] would just dwell in us but he said I
[1:32:22] will walk in them now I got to thinking
[1:32:25] about that brother Taz how amen is the
[1:32:28] Mighty God unveiled going to dwell in us
[1:32:31] but then he's also going to walk in us
[1:32:34] well third John 1:3 says this for I
[1:32:37] rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came
[1:32:40] and testified of the truth that is in
[1:32:43] thee even as thou wst in the truth so
[1:32:48] when they begin to testify that the
[1:32:50] truth was now in The Believer they are
[1:32:52] now walking in the truth look at verse
[1:32:55] four I have no Greater Joy than to hear
[1:32:59] that my children Walk In
[1:33:02] Truth God Has No Greater Joy than to
[1:33:06] know there is a generation on the earth
[1:33:08] who is not walking in the symbols of his
[1:33:11] word but they are walking in the reality
[1:33:14] of what he revealed from those symbols a
[1:33:17] man running from the presence of the
[1:33:18] Lord powerful quote he said somehow or
[1:33:21] another I just feel that we're going he
[1:33:24] said there's something that's laying
[1:33:26] right ahead of us he said now just
[1:33:29] remember I believe I am prophesy that
[1:33:32] great Joys lay ahead believe it that's
[1:33:36] right listen many sadden Hearts will be
[1:33:39] made he said great Mysteries will be
[1:33:43] made clear and people who are sad will
[1:33:46] be turned into Joy oh did you hear the
[1:33:50] words of a prophet I am prophesying to
[1:33:52] you there are great Joys that are laying
[1:33:55] ahead of the church listen there are
[1:33:57] many sad Hearts amen but when these
[1:34:00] Mysteries begin to be revealed it was a
[1:34:03] prophecy that the revealing of the
[1:34:05] Mysteries would be the bringing of great
[1:34:07] joy into the church listen friends our
[1:34:10] joy don't come from music though we
[1:34:12] thank God for it our joy don't come from
[1:34:15] our bank account our joy don't come from
[1:34:17] our health our joy don't come from where
[1:34:19] we work or where we go to school our joy
[1:34:22] comes from the revealing of the word of
[1:34:25] God in the age that we're living
[1:34:28] in that's why I can stand here tonight
[1:34:30] and say this joy that I have the world
[1:34:33] didn't give it to me this joy that I
[1:34:36] have the devil didn't give it to me oh
[1:34:39] the world didn't give it to me and the
[1:34:41] devil didn't give it to me so the world
[1:34:44] can't take it away and the devil can't
[1:34:46] take it away bad days can't take it away
[1:34:49] sorrowful days can't take it away I know
[1:34:52] who I am in the
[1:34:55] word hallelujah amen that when these
[1:34:58] Mysteries begin to be revealed it was a
[1:35:00] prophecy that great
[1:35:03] joy it was a prophecy that when these
[1:35:06] things become Revelation a great joy
[1:35:09] will come in the
[1:35:11] church now in 1962 brother B preaches
[1:35:14] the restoration of the brid tree he says
[1:35:17] I've got two pages of
[1:35:21] fruit that the worms have eaten off of
[1:35:23] the bride tree he said one of them is
[1:35:27] the fruit of Joy I want you to watch
[1:35:29] this we find out he took away the joy
[1:35:33] David one time said I lost the joy of my
[1:35:35] salvation he didn't lose his salvation
[1:35:39] he lost the joy of it but he just cried
[1:35:43] Lord restore to me the joy of my
[1:35:48] salvation said restoration of
[1:35:51] Joy so this little Palmer worm to eat
[1:35:54] that fruit of joy out now look you here
[1:35:56] you people make too much noise I tell
[1:35:59] you all this crying this singing amen
[1:36:01] and this shouting that's nonsense
[1:36:03] there's nothing to that see the first
[1:36:05] thing you know he sat in a big morg you
[1:36:08] know set out there all them dead and
[1:36:11] some of them in bombing fluids of
[1:36:12] so-called doctrine of Creeds he pumped
[1:36:15] into their veins where the spirit of God
[1:36:17] ought to be running listen The Same
[1:36:19] Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:36:22] ought to be running in the veins of
[1:36:24] every believer who believes in the power
[1:36:26] of his resurrection he said but the old
[1:36:28] church Creek pumped in there no wonder
[1:36:30] they I see cold and dead and oh can I
[1:36:34] preach brother sister and their
[1:36:36] spiritual thermometer is 90 below zero
[1:36:40] yeah somebody says amen everybody
[1:36:42] stretched their neck around like some
[1:36:44] kind of goose or something want to know
[1:36:45] what's said it's a
[1:36:47] shame well let's just say what a prophet
[1:36:50] said it's a shame when the church and
[1:36:53] the SP of God ought to be joy peace and
[1:36:55] love but this little old bug started
[1:36:57] eating on it and he eat all the joy away

[1:37:27] power of God come among you and the
[1:37:29] manifestation of God was seen and you
[1:37:31] didn't care if it was 9:00 or 10:00 or
[1:37:34] 2:00 you were just happy to be in the
[1:37:37] presence of God with an authority upon
[1:37:40] your heart well you know what I say I

[1:37:52] a bar room to enjoy a high I don't think
[1:37:56] our kids ought to dance their first
[1:37:58] dance on the barroom floor I think we as
[1:38:01] Eagles ought to create an atmosphere
[1:38:03] where the Holy Ghost can come in and we
[1:38:05] can enjoy the Revelation that would turn
[1:38:08] sadness into
[1:38:10] Joy Hallelujah somebody say well

[1:38:20] I beg to differ with you my Prophet said
[1:38:23] that where the word is preached there
[1:38:25] will be an
[1:38:28] enthusiasm I just might as well goad and

[1:41:00] need a Revival open up your eyes we're
[1:41:02] in a Revival it's the greatest Revival
[1:41:06] that has ever hit the face of the Earth
[1:41:08] it's not a man's Revival it's the
[1:41:10] bride's Revival it's the Thundering of
[1:41:12] seven Thunders it's the opening of Seven
[1:41:15] Seals it's the word in full strength
[1:41:17] being born into full manifestation again
[1:41:23] it's more than an emotion it's more than
[1:41:25] a feeling it's an
[1:41:28] enthusiasm and you know where it's
[1:41:29] coming from a special
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:35] Revelation so there is a connection
[1:41:38] between what you're
[1:41:41] eating and the fruit you're
[1:41:45] bearing my Bible says he that hath an
[1:41:48] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:41:51] un the church to him that
[1:41:55] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:41:58] Hidden Mana listen this hidden Mana Bram
[1:42:01] says it's a little something
[1:42:05] special what is the special the
[1:42:08] blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's
[1:42:11] for the whole congregation but the
[1:42:13] hidden Mana was a special
[1:42:17] Revelation ca he had to teach the other
[1:42:19] see was a little more knowledge of the
[1:42:21] scripture that he could teach others so
[1:42:24] hidden Mana was a type of the shoe bread
[1:42:27] which was reserved for the priest listen
[1:42:30] it was a special thing made for the
[1:42:32] priest that is the
[1:42:34] leaders and this man overcome the whole
[1:42:38] congregation got manner but he got a
[1:42:40] hidden special manner or a special
[1:42:43] Revelation oh of who Jesus was and what
[1:42:47] about him and all about him see he got
[1:42:50] that Revelation if he had had overcome
[1:42:54] to the angel now look I know brother
[1:42:56] says I will give him the hidden Mana we
[1:42:58] all know that Mana was angel food it was
[1:43:00] what God sent down upon the grass for
[1:43:02] Israel at the time of their wanderings
[1:43:05] so when Israel was wondering the way God
[1:43:09] ended their wonderings was by sending
[1:43:11] down Mana that had the ability to cause
[1:43:13] them to know rather than to wonder oh
[1:43:17] Church of the Living God in 1963 a
[1:43:20] Prophet come to a pull pit and said you
[1:43:22] wonder about this first seal you wonder
[1:43:24] about the voice of God he said turn to
[1:43:26] St John chap 12 and you won't have to
[1:43:29] wonder no more are you hearing me my
[1:43:32] Bible says in Revelation 13 that all on
[1:43:35] the earth they wondered and they were
[1:43:37] amazed at this Beast this power except
[1:43:40] for those whose names was recorded on
[1:43:43] the Lamb's Book of Life when the seals
[1:43:46] broke open listen there's oh God

[1:43:50] many generations that has believed there
[1:43:53] names was on the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:43:55] now for the first time in Seven Ages
[1:43:58] there is a group of people on the face
[1:43:59] of the Earth who is no longer wondering
[1:44:02] if their names are on the Lamb's Book of
[1:44:04] Life but they know their
[1:44:07] names you say how do you know your name

[1:44:28] longer wonder if my name is on the
[1:44:30] Lamb's Book of Life I have been
[1:44:32] receiving a food and the food is the
[1:44:35] bread of Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ it was perfect
[1:44:41] food it was perfect food it was bread
[1:44:45] from Heaven listen in every age the mess
[1:44:47] of the Lord of that age was given the
[1:44:49] revelation of God for that specific
[1:44:52] purpose or that specific period now let
[1:44:54] me just say this we are not feeding on
[1:45:00] enthusiasm we're not feeding on it but
[1:45:03] there is an enthusiasm
[1:45:06] coming from what we're feeding on 1965
[1:45:11] if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit
[1:45:12] the word of God Jesus said every word
[1:45:15] shall be by the Holy Spirit listen now
[1:45:18] if you try to feed it the wrong thing if
[1:45:21] it's the genuine Hool Holy Spirit in you
[1:45:24] it will know the difference now remember
[1:45:27] the word of God is what the Holy Spirit
[1:45:29] feeds on it don't feed on enthusiasm it
[1:45:33] don't feed on education it doesn't feed
[1:45:35] on Church going it doesn't feed on
[1:45:38] theologies there is a lot of difference
[1:45:40] between an inspired something and a
[1:45:42] theological standpoint of it now I'm
[1:45:45] just going to go ahead and say it amen
[1:45:47] the seventh seal is not a theology the
[1:45:50] seventh seal is not a teaching or it's
[1:45:52] not an education the seventh seal is the
[1:45:55] announcing of the return of Jesus Christ
[1:45:58] back to the church what is it it's Luke
[1:46:01] 17:30 in the day when the son of man is
[1:46:04] revealed listen the bride's Revival the
[1:46:08] enthusiasm in this bride is coming from
[1:46:10] the opening of the word somebody say
[1:46:13] well all that shouting and dancing in
[1:46:14] churches that's Pentecostalism well let
[1:46:17] me just say this I have preached in a
[1:46:19] Pentecostal church I was invited one
[1:46:21] time to preach the wildest experience in
[1:46:24] my life I went in there man I had a
[1:46:27] sermon it is written God has sent a
[1:46:29] prophet and I was just about 16 17 years
[1:46:31] old didn't know no better than just to
[1:46:32] say what a prophet said and thank God I
[1:46:34] still don't know no better so I just
[1:46:36] went in there and started preaching well
[1:46:37] before I went up there to preach there
[1:46:39] was the pastor he come to me listen
[1:46:41] there were people shouting dancing AES
[1:46:43] full altar full speaking in tongues
[1:46:46] Pastor walked by me brother brother
[1:46:47] Chris he he leaned over my shoulder he
[1:46:49] said now young man he said I know you've
[1:46:51] been invited here to preach
[1:46:53] he said but the Holy Ghost has done done
[1:46:55] his work he says if you just want to
[1:46:56] close out and not preach you can well
[1:46:59] young dumb stupid me you know I just
[1:47:01] turned around I said well brother you
[1:47:02] invited me here to preach if it's okay
[1:47:04] I'll just preach a little
[1:47:06] bit he said brother do what you want to
[1:47:09] so I opened my Bible let me show you a
[1:47:11] difference amen as long as the book was
[1:47:13] closed and there was no preaching they
[1:47:15] were shouting the aisles but the minute
[1:47:17] I opened the book and begin to preach
[1:47:19] Matthew chapter 4 that man shall not
[1:47:21] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:47:23] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:47:25] it was like you backed a fire truck in
[1:47:28] there and hooked up a water hose and
[1:47:30] watered that crowd down that was the
[1:47:32] quietest crowd I ever seen in my life
[1:47:35] you know what dwn don't me they got
[1:47:36] quiet when the word come open but do you
[1:47:39] know the difference in this bride we
[1:47:41] didn't get quiet when the word come open
[1:47:44] we got loud when the word come open
[1:47:47] because it was more than just a church
[1:47:49] service it was an enthusiasm in the de
[1:47:53] of our soul for the first time we were
[1:47:55] hearing from God the son of man was
[1:47:57] being revealed the son of man has
[1:47:59] already come from Glory he is revealing
[1:48:02] himself what is to reveal the son of man
[1:48:05] it is the word that is again waved over
[1:48:07] the people and the Dead traditions of
[1:48:10] man is
[1:48:13] dead and the Son of God is alive again
[1:48:16] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit he
[1:48:19] is right Among Us and is giving us life
[1:48:24] 1964 when you see the son of man
[1:48:26] revealed the food the word come back in
[1:48:29] human flesh 1964 the son of oh God the
[1:48:33] son of man is to be prophesied to be
[1:48:35] revealed what hallelujah what kind of
[1:48:39] revelation will it be it will be the
[1:48:41] revelation of his living after being
[1:48:44] crucified for 1900 years but he is
[1:48:48] raised from the dead and is alive with
[1:48:52] us in that day when the son of man is
[1:48:55] being revealed revealed a son of man are
[1:48:58] you ready for this you know what it is
[1:49:00] it's Jesus Christ made manifest among
[1:49:04] his people the revealing of the son of
[1:49:07] man is the manifesting of Jesus Christ
[1:49:10] among his people without tradition
[1:49:13] listen we are feeding on the son of man
[1:49:16] the son of man is Christ he's the one
[1:49:19] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[1:49:21] a man his word words will fail but
[1:49:23] you're feeding oh God on the unfailing
[1:49:27] body word of the son of man can I just
[1:49:30] go ahead and say it little bride you
[1:49:32] can't fail because what you're feeding
[1:49:34] on is the unfailing bread of the
[1:49:37] revealing of the son of man oh Church of
[1:49:40] the Living God if you haven't fed fully
[1:49:42] on every word to give yourself strength
[1:49:44] to Fly Above the denominations and
[1:49:46] things of the world will you do it at
[1:49:48] this
[1:49:50] time so there's a bread in the church
[1:49:53] there's a food coming in the church and
[1:49:55] the food is going to end the wanderings
[1:49:58] but it's going to bring a Revival the
[1:50:00] opening of the word is the end of the
[1:50:03] spiritual famine come on church it's the
[1:50:06] end of the lack of bread it's an end of
[1:50:09] a lack of spiritual water when the word
[1:50:12] comes open the sistern have lost their
[1:50:14] Authority we have been restored to the
[1:50:17] Arian well that was prophesied to be
[1:50:20] open in the House of David
[1:50:24] somebody say how can you keep quiet I
[1:50:26] can't keep quiet I can't contain myself
[1:50:29] when I start thinking about God who love
[1:50:31] this little old piece of Tennessee dirt
[1:50:33] so much that in the middle of a famine
[1:50:35] he would call me to a feast he would
[1:50:38] call me not to a Frolic not to a funeral
[1:50:40] procession but to a feast and there
[1:50:43] would be bread on the table there would
[1:50:45] be Authority on the
[1:50:47] table somebody say what are you talking
[1:50:49] about I'm talking about we have come
[1:50:51] Beyond imag inary interpretation we have
[1:50:54] come to the revelation of the word of
[1:50:57] God said this he said all right they
[1:51:00] lived right in the word speaking those
[1:51:01] men but they formed their own way of it
[1:51:04] listen oh my I'm running out of
[1:51:07] time they lived right in the word but
[1:51:10] they had speak to the priest they had
[1:51:12] formed their own way of it and their
[1:51:14] children had accepted it in such a way
[1:51:16] that the fathers had taught it until the
[1:51:19] fathers had taught it off of the real
[1:51:21] way and they made such an organization
[1:51:23] out of it now this is a bad condition
[1:51:26] brother Andrew till when the spirit
[1:51:29] tried to present truth they couldn't
[1:51:31] receive it that's the same thing
[1:51:35] today let me just say this somewhere
[1:51:37] sometime false doctrines have got to
[1:51:42] die somewhere sometime generational
[1:51:45] fights have got to
[1:51:47] die I'm just going to take my Liberty
[1:51:49] here and preach we are a new generation
[1:51:53] and listen I can't help what other
[1:51:55] preachers in Generations before me have
[1:51:57] done with this message but I refuse to
[1:52:01] give my voice to an imaginary
[1:52:03] interpretation when I have received the
[1:52:05] perfect interpretation with Divine
[1:52:10] [Applause]
[1:52:11] Vindication now you know what I'm
[1:52:13] talking about amen because years ago
[1:52:15] somebody amen we were talking about it
[1:52:16] today at lunch amen years ago somebody
[1:52:19] broke into the revelation of the seventh
[1:52:20] seal and then somebody didn't believe
[1:52:22] they ought to be preaching it so what
[1:52:23] they do they just shut down and that's
[1:52:25] idolatry and that's heresy and you know
[1:52:27] what happened amen men started out on
[1:52:30] trails are different from a prophet and
[1:52:32] begin to teach things contrary to what a
[1:52:35] prophet
[1:52:37] said we might as well preach we're this
[1:52:39] close to it perfect example go in some
[1:52:42] places and quote seven Thunders and
[1:52:44] watch the whole atmosphere
[1:52:45] change you know why it changes because a
[1:52:48] man's imaginary interpretation of what
[1:52:51] those seven Thunders
[1:52:53] has plagued generations for years but
[1:52:55] let me just go ahead and say it this is
[1:52:57] a new
[1:53:02] generation come on it's a new generation
[1:53:06] so we are called to possess the land
[1:53:09] come on we are a Joshua generation
[1:53:11] listen we are called to let the old
[1:53:13] Fighters take their fight and die off
[1:53:16] but this new generation will rise and
[1:53:18] will take the land of inheritance what
[1:53:21] are you saying I'm saying the spirit of
[1:53:23] God will come among the church and will
[1:53:25] present the present day truth and there
[1:53:27] will be somebody in position to receive
[1:53:30] the word of Truth and they will receive
[1:53:32] it without question they will receive it
[1:53:35] with authority what are you saying
[1:53:36] preacher I'm saying the Revival is not
[1:53:39] dying the Revival is growing you say
[1:53:42] preacher what are you getting at now let
[1:53:44] me just say this brother BM said all he
[1:53:46] said listen see the Revival itself
[1:53:48] amongst the churches 1965 ashamed he
[1:53:51] says the Revival itself self amongst the
[1:53:53] churches had died everyone knows that
[1:53:55] you feel in the Tabernacle you feel it
[1:53:57] everywhere there's a thump there's a
[1:53:59] dead feeling there's just something
[1:54:00] isn't right listen it's because the
[1:54:03] Revival enthusiasm has gone away from
[1:54:06] the people he said you go in the
[1:54:08] churches and you'll see them sitting
[1:54:10] there and the pastor stumbling around
[1:54:12] for a message and something other and
[1:54:14] the first thing you know he turned it
[1:54:15] off on some kind of a party or something
[1:54:18] it seems to be a dead thump everywhere
[1:54:21] 19 65 2 years since the seals have been
[1:54:26] opened and there's already a dead thump
[1:54:28] among the church you know a few days ago
[1:54:31] or a months ago I was sitting and I was
[1:54:33] just studying brother Taz and as I was
[1:54:35] studying the spirit of the Lord just
[1:54:36] come up my heart and it spoke these
[1:54:38] words I actually just wrote them down it
[1:54:40] said this if we lose our enthusiasm of
[1:54:44] the belief of special Revelations we
[1:54:46] will become embarrassed to
[1:54:50] them yes I said my Lord if we lose our
[1:54:55] enthusiasm of the special Revelations
[1:54:58] that have been brought to this bride by
[1:55:00] the message of the hour we will become
[1:55:02] embarrassed to them and then it dawned
[1:55:04] on me we got preachers taking the
[1:55:06] pictures out of their
[1:55:08] churches well let's go on we're this
[1:55:11] close to it put your seat belt on it's
[1:55:12] unexpected rough air it's turbulence but
[1:55:14] we'll get through
[1:55:16] it amen amen take the pictures of
[1:55:19] brother brandom out take the pillar of
[1:55:20] fire out come on Church
[1:55:23] you know why because it's an age of
[1:55:25] pressure they become embarrassed to be
[1:55:27] identified with what God has done in
[1:55:29] this generation and so the message
[1:55:32] churches become just another
[1:55:33] denominational Church well we might as
[1:55:35] well preach and people start saying
[1:55:37] don't quote brother brandom and don't
[1:55:39] say what a prophet said but you know
[1:55:41] what amazes me is men are not afraid to
[1:55:43] quote Charles
[1:55:45] Spurgeon they will stand behind the
[1:55:47] poophead and quote Charles Spurgeon who
[1:55:50] was a cigar smoking preacher and won't
[1:55:52] quote William Brandon they'll quote
[1:55:54] Church Hill or quote woodro Wilson or
[1:55:56] quote some politician but they won't
[1:55:58] quote Oh Come On Church they won't quote
[1:56:01] a prophet of God you know why because
[1:56:03] every devil in hell raises up when you
[1:56:05] identify that there's a messenger among
[1:56:08] the church oh God in the days of the
[1:56:11] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:56:13] begin to sound the wondering shall be
[1:56:16] over no wonder the devil don't want this
[1:56:19] message preached when you begin to
[1:56:21] preach this message you begin to bring
[1:56:23] the god of the Bible in the church and
[1:56:25] the devil begins to lose his influence
[1:56:28] well I want to say this tonight I come
[1:56:30] here to do war with the devil tonight I
[1:56:32] have come here with the spirit of the
[1:56:35] Living God In My Soul there is a war
[1:56:37] like energy in my spirit you say what is
[1:56:40] it a war to do it's a war to say devil
[1:56:43] you've diluted this message long enough
[1:56:45] you've watered it down long enough this
[1:56:48] is a new
[1:56:50] generation hallelujah it's a New
[1:56:52] Generation when it comes to a genuine
[1:56:54] unrated word of God confirmed by God he
[1:56:57] said it seems to even embarrass the
[1:56:59] other group on the radical
[1:57:01] side see there's an embarrassment about
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:06] it old sermon called
[1:57:09] ashamed identifies the word ashamed as
[1:57:12] embarrassed and says they become
[1:57:16] embarrassed I think it's amazing brother
[1:57:18] he says that they become it he said they
[1:57:19] won't he said they have blood and hands
[1:57:21] and oil and fire handling snakes running
[1:57:24] around all kinds of crazy things he said
[1:57:26] they're not embarrassed about that he
[1:57:28] said but start talking about seven
[1:57:30] angels meeting the prophet and he said
[1:57:32] all of a sudden they get
[1:57:36] embarrassed he said when you're
[1:57:37] embarrassed you're ashamed you don't
[1:57:38] know what you're talking
[1:57:40] about he said but listen it's a reality
[1:57:44] to a man or woman boy or girl who is a
[1:57:46] real genuine Christian when God made the
[1:57:49] promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:51] and you receive it there is something
[1:57:54] that settles within you then there is
[1:57:56] nothing takes its place when a man ever
[1:57:59] meets God not in some emotional workup
[1:58:02] or some enthusiasm or some religious
[1:58:05] Doctrine or some catechism or some Creed
[1:58:07] or Dogma that he has accepted for a
[1:58:09] comfort for himself but when he really
[1:58:11] comes to a place like Moses did on the
[1:58:14] backside of the desert he walks up face
[1:58:17] to face with almighty God you see the
[1:58:20] voice speaking to you exactly with the
[1:58:23] word and the promise of the hour there
[1:58:25] is something that it does to you he said
[1:58:28] see you're not ashamed of it it does
[1:58:32] something to you when the voice of the
[1:58:35] word begins to speak back to you it
[1:58:38] removes a timidity it removes as shamess
[1:58:42] it removes embarrassment and the voice
[1:58:45] speaking back to you by the word imparts
[1:58:47] an authority in your heart amen amen can
[1:58:50] I can I can I share something with you
[1:58:52] for a second the Bible says that Elisha
[1:58:54] brother Chris brought it out on on on
[1:58:55] Saturday morning I believe the Elisha
[1:58:57] the tishbite who was inhabitants of
[1:58:59] Gilead s Abel or Ahab rather as the Lord
[1:59:02] God of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[1:59:04] there shall not be Doom or rain these
[1:59:06] years but according to my word now you
[1:59:09] know that God had sent Elijah to chth
[1:59:11] and when God sent him to chth he then
[1:59:13] sent him to a widow of zerath and as you
[1:59:16] heard on the other morning we heard he
[1:59:17] raised her son to life now in First
[1:59:19] Kings chapter 18 the Bible says amen
[1:59:23] have you got have you got a few
[1:59:25] minutes the Bible says that Elijah
[1:59:28] instructed amen was instructed to go
[1:59:30] show himself under Ahab so what he does
[1:59:32] is he goes to Mount Carmel and there's a
[1:59:34] showdown amen between Baal and God now
[1:59:38] and I want you to catch something they
[1:59:39] went up there and they prepared the
[1:59:42] altars they prepared the altars they got
[1:59:45] everything ready but brother Isaac the
[1:59:47] amazing thing to me was that Elijah and
[1:59:50] Bales they both prepared the same same
[1:59:52] altars but there was a secret you know
[1:59:54] what the secret was they said don't put
[1:59:56] no fire on the
[1:59:58] altar don't put no fire on it because
[2:00:01] the god that answers by fire let him be
[2:00:04] God brother B said the prophets of Baal
[2:00:07] the Bible says they got nervous and they
[2:00:09] begin to cut themselves are you with me
[2:00:11] they begin to say maybe maybe your God
[2:00:14] is is per Venture he's away on a holiday
[2:00:17] am brother said they were all tore up
[2:00:19] but do you know that while they were
[2:00:20] cutting themselves Elijah was resting
[2:00:23] with an enthusiasm because he had a
[2:00:26] special Revelation you know what that
[2:00:28] special Revelation Was Elijah knew the
[2:00:31] fire didn't come till the evening
[2:00:36] time he knew there was no promise of
[2:00:39] fire until the evening time amen do you
[2:00:42] are you hearing me he wasn't embarrassed
[2:00:46] he wasn't ashamed because he had a
[2:00:48] special Revelation in his heart
[2:00:52] you say why aren't you ashamed preacher
[2:00:54] because it'll be a dark day it'll be a
[2:00:57] dismal day but in the evening time there
[2:01:00] shall be light
[2:01:02] again are you hearing me amen from there
[2:01:05] look in first Kings 18 the Bible says
[2:01:08] Elijah gets un Ahab and get the up eat
[2:01:10] drink for there is a sound of an
[2:01:12] abundance of rain you know what they
[2:01:14] said they said there is a sound of an
[2:01:17] abundance of rain can I just say this to
[2:01:19] you tonight can I say it to you from my
[2:01:21] heart heart the days of your spiritual
[2:01:24] drought is
[2:01:29] over the days of your spiritual drought
[2:01:33] are over there is a sound of an
[2:01:36] abundance of rain you know the Bible
[2:01:38] said there would be a former rain but he
[2:01:41] would also cause to come down for you
[2:01:42] the former rain and the latter rain in
[2:01:45] the first month do you know in Hebrews
[2:01:47] chapter 6 The Bible says the Earth which
[2:01:50] drinketh in the rain that cometh soft on
[2:01:52] it amen receive bringeth forth herbs
[2:01:54] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[2:01:56] receiveth blessing from God now do you
[2:01:59] all remember that brother Bram goes I'm
[2:02:01] I'm having to skip over a bunch but I
[2:02:02] trust you're with me he said this he
[2:02:05] said there I was in that Greens Mill
[2:02:06] cave he said I saw that vision of
[2:02:08] Hebrews 6 he said but I also saw I saw a
[2:02:12] cloud that was coming with rain he said
[2:02:15] in other words it'll be a teaching rain
[2:02:18] and a harvest rain now we've had the
[2:02:21] teaching rain but we're ready now for
[2:02:24] the Harvest rain he said you know the
[2:02:26] first rain is when you plant the seed
[2:02:29] the starts your crop growing then it
[2:02:31] just before it matures there comes
[2:02:33] another crop and that's what we call a
[2:02:37] harvest rain he said now we find out
[2:02:39] what the rain is the rain is the spirit
[2:02:43] so when the spirit comes among the
[2:02:45] church who has been delivered from the
[2:02:47] dead Traditions by the revealing of the
[2:02:50] son of man and begins to to present
[2:02:52] Revelation he said God is going to make
[2:02:55] a way for man to live again because
[2:02:57] there would be another spoken word that
[2:03:00] a virgin would receive oh Church of the
[2:03:03] Living God there will come forth one
[2:03:06] with a message that will restore the
[2:03:09] hearts or the faith of the children back
[2:03:11] to the fathers listen the prophet
[2:03:13] messenger who was sent to teach the
[2:03:15] people and to turn the hearts of the
[2:03:17] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[2:03:19] had not yet come thus what the thought
[2:03:22] to be restoration and the final
[2:03:24] quickening unto the Rapture had not come
[2:03:27] but can I make an announcement to you
[2:03:29] tonight the Harvest rain is rapturing
[2:03:32] Faith and Elijah was in a drought they
[2:03:36] needed some rain you know what he said
[2:03:38] he said get thee up and eat for there is
[2:03:40] a
[2:03:42] sound there is a sound of an abundance
[2:03:46] of rain I took time to look up that word
[2:03:48] sound you know what the word sound means
[2:03:51] void
[2:03:54] there is a voice of an abundance of rain
[2:03:57] listen he said go again seven times and
[2:04:00] it came to pass on the seventh Church
[2:04:02] age I mean on the seventh
[2:04:05] time I'm feeling too good right now
[2:04:07] brother Ben it came to pass on the
[2:04:09] seventh time that he said behold there
[2:04:12] ariseth a little Cloud amen out of the
[2:04:15] sea and it's like a man's hand he said
[2:04:18] go up into Ahab prepare thy Chariot and
[2:04:21] get thee down that the rain stopped thee
[2:04:23] not and it came to pass in the meanwhile
[2:04:25] that the heaven was black with clouds
[2:04:27] and wind and there was a great rain and
[2:04:30] Ahab rode and went to jezrael and the
[2:04:33] Hand of the Lord was upon Elijah listen
[2:04:37] amen six Church ages of drought but
[2:04:40] there was a seventh age and there was an
[2:04:42] Elijah who was commissioned to receive a
[2:04:45] rain and you know what he did he went
[2:04:47] out and he looked up in the skies can
[2:04:49] you give me that first picture he went
[2:04:52] out and looked up in the skies and he
[2:04:53] saw
[2:04:56] that woo Glory you say preacher that
[2:05:01] ain't the cloud the size of a man's hand
[2:05:03] listen Elijah saw the cloud the size of
[2:05:06] a man's hand but in the seventh Church
[2:05:09] age our Elijah brother brandom walked
[2:05:11] out and he saw a cloud but it wasn't the
[2:05:14] size of a man's hand it was the size of
[2:05:17] the face of God it was the return of the
[2:05:21] son of man

[2:05:25] announcing your wonderings are over it

[2:05:47] like this he said that appeared he said
[2:05:50] and science took the picture picture but
[2:05:52] you know what science couldn't figure it
[2:05:54] out you know why because it wasn't for
[2:05:57] them it wasn't for SS you know who it
[2:06:00] was for it was for the elected ones who
[2:06:03] had a seed in their soul to hear the
[2:06:07] sound of an abundance of rain come on
[2:06:10] Church what was the Harvest rain it was
[2:06:12] rapturing
[2:06:14] Faith are you hearing me it was
[2:06:16] rapturing Faith don't get mad at me okay

[2:06:36] could interpret it anybody could say it
[2:06:38] was this I had a friend brother Ed
[2:06:40] Hunter who was at brandham Tabernacle
