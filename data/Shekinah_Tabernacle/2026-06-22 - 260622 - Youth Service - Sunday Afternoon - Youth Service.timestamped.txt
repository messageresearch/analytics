[36:40] uh we're
[36:42] we have a multi-generational
[36:45] fellowship
[36:46] praise god
[36:48] praise god it's not just the old people
[36:50] pulling and the it's the everyone's
[36:53] pulling together the young people
[36:54] pulling everyone is together you know
[36:56] everyone's everyone's on the front line
[36:58] they got their weapon in their hand and
[37:00] they're firing with everything within
[37:01] them pushing together as a body
[37:03] and because there has to come a time
[37:05] where it's not just the older or the
[37:07] parents oh yes i don't i don't like to
[37:09] put myself in any kind of bracket i'm a
[37:10] young person
[37:12] um but you know don't put me in a box um
[37:14] but you know there comes a time when
[37:17] where where we read here in micah where
[37:19] it's in a way it's like as if if mike is
[37:21] looking for a future event therefore
[37:23] i'll look upon the lord i'll wait for
[37:25] god for the god of my salvation he will
[37:27] hear me and i could say really we could
[37:29] i don't want to add or take away from
[37:30] the scripture but we can actually look
[37:32] and we can say no he has heard me yeah
[37:35] you know it's not a future event that
[37:36] he'll hear me or i will wait for him
[37:38] he's already come upon the scene
[37:40] we've called jesus on the scene he
[37:42] stepped out of history and he's doing a
[37:44] work
[37:45] and we can we can say you know not that
[37:48] uh i will i shall arise but a people
[37:51] have risen
[37:52] there's a people i'm looking at and it
[37:54] doesn't matter what age you are you've
[37:56] risen
[37:57] the lord is lighted upon you you know we
[38:00] live in a time of great darkness great
[38:02] confusion there's people pulling all
[38:04] different ways many opinions ideas and
[38:06] you know
[38:07] all around
[38:09] but it's all darkness
[38:11] but god has shown a light in this day
[38:13] and
[38:14] if we can if we can tap into that light
[38:17] which is the revealed word of the hour
[38:20] there's it is unlimited what god can do
[38:23] we can look down through history like
[38:24] you can take even you know a lot of the
[38:26] great revivals of the past were actually
[38:28] young people it wasn't the older
[38:30] generations it was the young yeah um you
[38:32] could even take you could even think
[38:34] about when jesus came upon the earth
[38:35] john was 30 and then jesus was 30 when
[38:38] they entered their ministry they would
[38:39] have been counted as young people
[38:41] you know they weren't they weren't in
[38:43] their 50s 60s they were young people the
[38:45] welsh revival that brought under over a
[38:46] hundred thousand souls was young people
[38:49] in wales
[38:50] crying out this is i think 1904 around
[38:52] there there was a great cry a great stir
[38:54] but it was the young people that god
[38:56] allowed to use as a channel i mean to
[38:59] bring that revival and i think god does
[39:01] that because he wants to show the older
[39:03] generations don't get stayed in your
[39:05] ways
[39:06] you know i'm the same yesterday today
[39:08] and forever don't just get set in your
[39:09] ways but let god work and um and and we
[39:13] can we can look even here where god has
[39:15] has has brought us young fellas in
[39:19] praise the lord
[39:20] but it's a tremendous thing because it
[39:22] takes the lord to shine his light upon a
[39:24] soul
[39:26] and it's a supernatural eternal work
[39:28] where we've been ordained for this hour
[39:31] you know we're here for this this is the
[39:33] reason we're here
[39:34] not just i'm not talking about just
[39:36] sitting in church but i'm saying to be a
[39:37] light to this dying world
[39:39] where where um we would read uh maybe we
[39:42] won't read it but to save time because
[39:43] i've kind of set myself 15 minutes but
[39:46] you know in in the book of revelation
[39:48] john
[39:49] saw the lord the resurrected lord jesus
[39:52] with seven stars in his right hand
[39:55] right yeah and and and those stars it
[39:57] says today the angels to the churches
[40:00] an angel means a messenger we know that
[40:02] angel angelic beings do not preach the
[40:03] gospel it's man that preaches the gospel
[40:06] you know like when cornelius was praying
[40:07] in acts chapter 10 and and you're an
[40:09] angel appears to him says you know your
[40:11] arms and your prayers will come before
[40:12] god you know it wasn't now the angel
[40:15] didn't say now i'm going to preach to
[40:16] you you know the gospel he says go get
[40:18] peter he'll preach it to you you know so
[40:20] god always uses man so those stars are
[40:23] ministries or men in the right hand of
[40:25] god predestinated ones and they've been
[40:27] released down through the ages now
[40:29] down everyone who caught the light that
[40:31] was reflected off that star
[40:33] illuminated their age as well it wasn't
[40:36] just a great ministry that that
[40:38] illuminated the age of the gospel with
[40:40] the power of god it was everyone in the
[40:42] church so the apostle paul was the first
[40:44] one
[40:45] you know the light of god shone upon him
[40:47] on the road to damascus he became the
[40:49] start of the age he wasn't his own light
[40:51] he was bringing he said i didn't get
[40:52] this from man it was by revelation of
[40:54] jesus christ and most of the new
[40:56] testament was through him so it wasn't
[40:58] his own ideas it was actually god
[40:59] revealing himself through the apostle
[41:01] paul but then there are other people
[41:02] under him like timothy where timothy was
[41:04] told let no one despise your youth you
[41:07] know we should be able to look beyond
[41:08] age right we should be able to look
[41:09] beyond age and a mount of grey or no
[41:12] grey or here or no here whatever you
[41:13] know actually discern the gift within
[41:16] one another
[41:17] because we're all part of the body now
[41:19] we're all we're all one big family
[41:21] right we're all one part of the body and
[41:23] we all need each other right we're all a
[41:26] vital part of this final move of god
[41:28] among the gentiles we're vital you may
[41:30] think i have no significance you're very
[41:32] significant yes you know it's like a you
[41:34] know you may be work behind the scenes
[41:36] organizing things it's very important
[41:38] you let those people go the place will
[41:40] fall apart you know you need the you
[41:42] need the prayer worries in the back you
[41:43] may be not saying anything they are the
[41:45] most vital force so everyone everyone
[41:47] either up front or in the back or in the
[41:50] in the pew creating an atmosphere for
[41:51] god to come down it's it's vital oh my
[41:53] lord it's very very important so so down
[41:56] through the ages there's been seven
[41:57] stars we know the last star has been
[41:59] brother brown's ministry
[42:01] where it wasn't just you know you know
[42:03] so now christ was revealed through that
[42:04] style now this is we live in a dark age
[42:07] but god used used that ministry to
[42:09] reflect himself to the earth
[42:11] and those who caught who actually tapped
[42:13] into that sunlight that was reflected
[42:15] off him
[42:16] of the gospel they became illuminated
[42:19] and we know in this age as an age of
[42:22] restoration and liberty
[42:24] this is what this age is about this is
[42:26] not an age of going down to dark ages
[42:28] this is a full restoration of truth full
[42:30] restoration of power where what we read
[42:33] who likes to read bible stories
[42:35] he likes your bible stories who likes to
[42:37] see yourself in the bible story amen
[42:39] amen so you can see like you can see
[42:41] peter in the jail and the angel comes
[42:43] down and sets them free or you know
[42:44] david killing goliath or you know hannah
[42:47] going before the tabernacle of the
[42:48] wilderness and praying for a son and god
[42:51] gives her a prophet and revival breaks
[42:52] out in israel or you know like the
[42:54] prayer meeting there and um you know you
[42:56] know there and i think it was rhodes no
[42:58] no it wasn't rhoda's house but she was a
[42:59] servant girl that came to the door when
[43:00] peter got let out of the prison you know
[43:03] like you can see yourself i trust you
[43:05] can see yourself in those stories
[43:07] amen
[43:08] and because the reason god wants you to
[43:10] see yourself in this because that same
[43:11] kind of life will be living through you
[43:14] you may not be killing lions and beers
[43:16] and giants but there's spiritual there's
[43:18] this demon spirits to be to be down
[43:21] you know and and but there's prayer
[43:23] meanings to have for god to live so you
[43:25] know
[43:27] so he reflects himself so god reflects
[43:29] himself down into us and then we
[43:31] illuminate the age
[43:33] by his holy ghost
[43:36] and now that gives us light
[43:38] so when whenever he gives us light like
[43:41] that when the when the word comes open
[43:43] like that to a person then they can say
[43:46] not i shall arise but i have arisen
[43:49] i did sit in darkness the darkness of my
[43:51] own mind just thinking well this is just
[43:53] how it's going to be and when i grow up
[43:54] i want to be this and you know caught up
[43:57] in just stuff
[43:58] but then their eyes come open and you
[44:00] say hey i'm a son of god i'm a daughter
[44:02] of god
[44:03] you know i'm living in a time where a
[44:05] rapture is going to happen where a
[44:06] restoration is taking place and you know
[44:09] where where the devil's under my feet i
[44:10] don't have to pander to him but he's
[44:12] here to actually obey my voice
[44:15] amen so
[44:16] to me this is an incredible this is an
[44:19] incredible time
[44:20] here right here
[44:22] we are i think
[44:24] i think we have some of the finest young
[44:25] people in the world this is maybe i'm
[44:27] biased you know parents are biased i
[44:29] guess
[44:30] you know but the thing is the lord has
[44:32] gathered us for a purpose
[44:34] and it thrills my heart i know i've said
[44:36] it before but when you know the you know
[44:38] the older young people are having prayer
[44:39] meetings and god's answering prayer
[44:41] right god's answering prayer in there
[44:43] can we can someone say you know i'm not
[44:45] just making up stuff god's answering
[44:47] prayer
[44:48] and
[44:49] we've gotta just i just encourage you if
[44:51] you fall just get back up
[44:54] remember the devil doesn't want you to
[44:55] stay on the road he doesn't want you to
[44:57] keep serving god he's against you but
[44:59] god's for you
[45:01] right god's for you even if you fall
[45:03] god's for you even if you fail yourself
[45:05] willingly god's still for you you just
[45:07] gotta get up repent put it under the
[45:10] blood and walk on
[45:12] amen amen that's you know and but keep
[45:15] keep fighting the battle
[45:17] keep serving the lord now as i said that
[45:19] those who caught the light for their age
[45:22] illuminated the age but the thing is
[45:23] that word this word and i could hold the
[45:25] messenger to is our source of strength
[45:28] it's vital some people think oh you know
[45:30] all he says to us to do is pray and
[45:31] listen to the message and read the bible
[45:33] there's spiritual strength in that
[45:36] there's spiritual strength we're going
[45:37] to grow up the inner man
[45:39] it'll it'll help you in your walk even
[45:41] as even as young people in school i
[45:43] remember when i started high school i
[45:44] saw the year 13 so they called them now
[45:46] i thought man i'm never gonna get there
[45:48] it's like five years it's like forever
[45:49] away
[45:50] you know and i won't say how many years
[45:52] ago that was but i don't have enough
[45:53] fingers and toes maybe to count that but
[45:55] you know but the thing is don't you know
[45:58] just
[45:59] love the lord with all your heart amen
[46:01] you know love him with thanksgiving
[46:03] praise him even if you don't feel like
[46:05] it give him thanks
[46:06] and remember that
[46:08] we
[46:09] we have a vision
[46:10] we have a vision
[46:12] that vision is is to walk with the lord
[46:14] and take a rapture
[46:15] right that that's god's vision for us
[46:18] you know whatever job we get different
[46:20] things that's all part of it too but the
[46:22] main thing is we just walk with the lord
[46:25] and follow him and love him with all
[46:26] your heart just remember there's so much
[46:29] like we have a thirst in our in our life
[46:31] you could say it's you know
[46:33] you know but and that thirst will go on
[46:35] different things as you walk through
[46:36] life but make sure most of it's on the
[46:38] lord because because it's a natural
[46:40] desire to get married want to have a
[46:42] career different things right so there's
[46:44] a thirst for that but don't let all of
[46:46] your thirst go on those things keep your
[46:48] mind thirst on the lord and he'll guide
[46:50] you with those things
[46:52] right because remember we're not robots
[46:54] we're people and god knows we're people
[46:57] but as we walk with god
[47:00] you know there's going to be more giants
[47:02] that are going to come against us more
[47:03] spirits will come against us
[47:06] and the road isn't easy but the lord
[47:09] makes it possible and he makes it
[47:10] satisfying
[47:12] right hey you can look back on your
[47:13] trophy wall and say lord you won all
[47:14] these victories in my life
[47:16] isn't it satisfying we can look back say
[47:18] lord you stepped upon the scene
[47:20] and i pray
[47:22] that we will get a greater love for
[47:24] truth
[47:25] a greater love for it
[47:27] that you'll love i i trust you all fall
[47:29] in love with this amen amen you'll fall
[47:31] in love with this right the words in
[47:33] here are eternal
[47:35] i because i was thinking what could i
[47:37] say to us all
[47:38] if this was the last
[47:40] the last time i ever stand here
[47:43] i'd say fall in love with him
[47:46] fall in love with him and whatever
[47:47] happens in life if your life is fully
[47:50] surrendered to him it'll all work out
[47:52] for your good the moment may not seem
[47:54] good but it'll work out for your good
[47:56] and live a life that
[47:57] say lord as long as my life is pleasing
[48:00] unto thee
[48:01] then whatever you do with it that's fine
[48:03] you know it's amazing isaiah 53 maybe
[48:05] we'll just go there quickly and then
[48:06] i'll end i've got i've got two minutes
[48:09] isaiah 53
[48:12] because if our lives are completely
[48:13] surrendered to god we cannot be actually
[48:16] disappointed in his leadership
[48:17] hallelujah you know
[48:19] we might be disappointed in the
[48:20] situation because we thought it would go
[48:21] a different way
[48:23] but praise the lord
[48:26] you know praise the lord that's all
[48:31] now i can
[48:33] i might just need to start reading here
[48:35] he says now
[48:36] this is from
[48:38] this we'll just start from verse one who
[48:40] hath believed our report to whom is the
[48:42] arm of the lord revealed for he shall
[48:44] grow up before him as a tender plant as
[48:46] a root out of dry ground he has no form
[48:49] nor coming us that when we shall see him
[48:50] there is no beauty that we should desire
[48:52] and this is describing the lord jesus he
[48:54] is despised and rejected of men a man of
[48:57] sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid
[48:59] as it were our faces from him and he was
[49:01] despised and we esteemed him up surely
[49:03] he had borne our griefs and carried our
[49:05] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken a
[49:08] stricken smitten of god afflicted but he
[49:10] was wounded for our transgressions he
[49:12] was bruised for our iniquities the
[49:13] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[49:16] and with his stripes we are healed now i
[49:18] trust this whole chapter becomes like
[49:20] daily food
[49:22] because this is god's covenant with you
[49:24] amen we are all like sheep have gone
[49:26] astray we have turned everyone to his
[49:28] own way the lord has laid on him the the
[49:30] iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[49:33] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[49:34] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[49:36] lamb to the slaughter as the sheep
[49:38] before his shearers is done he opened
[49:39] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[49:42] and from judgment and who shall declare
[49:43] his generation if he was cut off for the
[49:45] land of the living for the transgression
[49:47] of my people was he stricken and he
[49:50] and he made his grave with the wicked
[49:52] and with the rich in his death because
[49:54] he had done no violence neither was he
[49:56] any deceit in his mouth now this is the
[49:58] this is the first one to get to verse 10
[50:00] he says
[50:03] and i'll and i'll and i'll finish with
[50:05] this
[50:06] and christy and i were talking about
[50:07] this a while ago yet it pleased the lord
[50:09] to bruise him
[50:12] so it actually was pleasing to god to
[50:14] bruise the messiah
[50:16] it pleased him
[50:18] and because the lord was the lamb of god
[50:21] whatever the lord had whatever you say
[50:23] the father had for him he was willing to
[50:25] take
[50:26] not my will but thy will be done amen
[50:29] and so i pray that we're all in our
[50:31] hearts would have a life that would say
[50:33] lord
[50:34] as whatever is pleasing to you
[50:37] may it happen in my
[50:38] life and that doesn't mean all the great
[50:41] stuff that we think is great
[50:43] if it's pr it's pleasing that i'd be
[50:45] bruised
[50:47] for my friends
[50:49] for my family
[50:50] for others
[50:52] amen i trust we'd have that kind of a
[50:55] heart hallelujah lord mate i want to
[50:57] live a life that's pleasing to you
[51:00] because the lord has lighted upon us and
[51:01] we have arisen
[51:03] amen we're not a natural people we're a
[51:05] supernatural people
[51:07] serving a supernatural god who does is
[51:08] doing supernatural things
[51:10] so
[51:12] i'm going to finish there we're going to
[51:14] have david
[51:16] come forward so i promise
[51:18] i'd be short because we're not here to
[51:19] listen to me

[53:20] we'll just read a
[53:22] quick scripture i think we'll turn our
[53:24] bibles to um john
[53:26] john 4 24.
[53:39] i mean
[53:40] it says here god is a spirit and they
[53:43] that worship him must worship
[53:46] him in spirit and in truth
[53:48] i mean you may have your seats
[53:52] i mean so i just want to talk i want to
[53:54] talk i want to talk about the um
[53:56] my sermon title um this afternoon is
[53:59] worship and that word worship means um
[54:02] to show reverence
[54:04] and
[54:05] adoration for a deity
[54:08] i mean so i want to talk about talk
[54:09] about a little bit about the spirit
[54:12] um so it says here and faith is a
[54:15] substance it says
[54:18] and then your inward man is the spirit
[54:20] which has two senses faith and
[54:22] unbelief amen
[54:24] and then i want to um speak here also in
[54:27] why i am a holy roller
[54:29] um
[54:30] but god accepted abel's offering because
[54:33] abel by faith offered a more excellent
[54:35] sacrifice than cain by being just amen
[54:38] amen
[54:41] i found that i found it quite powerful
[54:44] and i also
[54:46] like to go to
[54:50] um the angel of god it says here
[54:55] oh people rise in the name of your lord
[54:58] claim your god-given privilege for the
[55:00] hour is here for you to be healed that's
[55:02] right to glorify god and to receive of
[55:05] his spirit and his blessings
[55:09] amen
[55:10] amen so we're here too
[55:12] so
[55:13] we're here to
[55:14] receive receive of god's spirit amen
[55:17] this
[55:18] this afternoon i mean when we when we're
[55:20] in the spirit we must be in the spirit
[55:22] of christ yes amen oh that's right
[55:25] i mean i just want to turn to um first
[55:27] peter
[55:28] four and six
[55:30] sorry sorry first peter four
[55:32] looks
[55:57] first peter 4 and 6
[55:59] it says for this cause was the gospel
[56:01] preached also to the embedded dead that
[56:03] they might be judged according to me in
[56:05] the flesh but live according to god and
[56:07] the spirit
[56:09] amen
[56:10] and if we could turn to
[56:12] first john 4 and 1
[56:17] first one four and one it says behold
[56:19] believe not every spirit but try the
[56:21] spirits whether they are of god because
[56:24] many false prophets are gone out into
[56:26] the world i mean so john saying that we
[56:28] must try the spirits because there's not
[56:30] you know not not all spirits are of god
[56:33] and if we could go to um galatians
[56:36] 5
[56:38] and 22
[56:40] galatians
[56:53] so galatians 5
[56:56] and
[56:56] this 22 says
[57:01] but the fruit of the spirit
[57:03] is talking about it with the fruit of
[57:05] the spirit of christ the fruit of the
[57:06] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[57:10] gentleness goodness faith and 23.
[57:12] meekness temperance against such there
[57:15] is no law i mean so that those are the
[57:17] attributes of of christ those are those
[57:20] that's that's the fruit so
[57:22] um i want to go to
[57:24] experiences brother brandon talks about
[57:27] experiences it says there's talking
[57:29] about an evil spirit now this is what
[57:31] he's talking and there had been many
[57:33] spirits had went out of the people and
[57:36] got into others this one woman had went
[57:38] insane
[57:39] she was got her mind off the lord on
[57:42] some woman was talking to her sitting
[57:44] there she turned around while i was
[57:46] praying i was was talking to the woman
[57:49] and an insane spirit came upon her
[57:52] i had to leave the pool soul like that
[57:54] she's still insane i mean so it's an
[57:56] evil spirit so we want the the spirit of
[57:58] god this this afternoon amen
[58:00] want to be touched by christ
[58:03] so that's that's what he's when we when
[58:05] we're in his we must when we worship we
[58:06] must worship in god's spirit amen his
[58:09] spirit must flow freely through us and
[58:11] then we can enter into his blessed
[58:13] presence
[58:14] amen i want to turn to um uh john 14 6
[58:19] john 14 6.
[58:24] amen and it says here
[58:27] i know i just want to talk i want to
[58:29] touch on um touch on truth now
[58:31] it says here jesus saith unto him i am
[58:34] the way the truth and the life no man
[58:37] cometh unto the father but by me so
[58:39] jesus is saying that he is he he's
[58:42] clearly states here i am the truth amen
[58:44] do we believe this morning so we say and
[58:46] we want to go to um 217 he he states
[58:49] again even the spirit of truth whom the
[58:52] world cannot receive because it saith
[58:54] him not neither knoweth him
[58:57] but ye know him
[58:58] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[59:01] you
[59:02] amen so jesus is
[59:05] clearly says that he is the truth and
[59:07] then if we go to john 17 17
[59:14] says here sanctify them through thy
[59:16] truth
[59:17] thy word is truth amen so god's word
[59:20] this this bible this is god's truth amen
[59:23] how powerful is that we can have the
[59:25] the the truth of god in our very in our
[59:28] very presence this afternoon
[59:30] amen and if i just want to go to
[59:32] another quote from brother branham
[59:34] uh this is
[59:40] um diseases and afflictions it says here
[59:43] and without faith it's impossible to
[59:45] please god and if you want to please him
[59:47] you must come to him with faith
[59:50] believing his word is truth amen you
[59:52] must believe his word is truth in order
[59:54] to please you almighty maker amen the
[59:56] god that created you amen
[59:58] oh hallelujah we we have the honor to
[1:00:00] please him amen so he must believe that
[1:00:02] his this this word is truth
[1:00:05] amen in order in order to please christ
[1:00:07] amen amen and us want to amen go to
[1:00:10] another quote from brother branham
[1:00:12] this one is in
[1:00:16] um israel is israel in the church and it
[1:00:18] says here when i was born in a little
[1:00:20] kentucky cabin up there the angel of the
[1:00:23] lord came in the window and stood there
[1:00:25] there was a pillar of fire and i said
[1:00:28] god has proved that and if i tell the
[1:00:30] truth god will vindicate the truth amen
[1:00:33] so god will have mitigated truth and we
[1:00:35] all know that um vindicate means
[1:00:38] to clear someone of blame or suspicion
[1:00:41] show or prove right reasonable or
[1:00:42] justified amen so god will will prove
[1:00:45] right the truth so we don't have to
[1:00:47] question they mean god god will god will
[1:00:49] show us that's right
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:52] and i just want to want to start
[1:00:54] i have another quote here there's also
[1:00:56] israel in the church it says
[1:00:58] the lie that came
[1:00:59] that satan told eve was 90 truth
[1:01:04] 90 truth and the lie that you can tell
[1:01:07] how i've heard men bypass pieces in
[1:01:09] scripture just to keep from it hurts the
[1:01:12] theology see but if if if this part's
[1:01:15] right that part's right amen
[1:01:18] let's put it together and make it fit
[1:01:20] through the whole bible
[1:01:22] oh hallelujah
[1:01:27] when we're talking about truth
[1:01:29] truth is the fullness of god so in order
[1:01:31] to worship in spirit and in truth you
[1:01:33] must you must worship in god's spirit
[1:01:35] and in truth your whole life must must
[1:01:38] be be must live according to this word
[1:01:40] amen to god's truth and then we can
[1:01:42] worship amen we can enter into god and
[1:01:45] we can have a blessed time in his
[1:01:46] presence
[1:01:48] amen we cannot we cannot live our lives
[1:01:50] 90 percent if we live at 90
[1:01:51] it's a lie amen we must live the full
[1:01:54] 100 percent in god
[1:01:55] and then and his full truth amen
[1:02:00] amen i just like to talk about the
[1:02:01] raising of hands and worship now that we
[1:02:03] can all worship amen let's talk about
[1:02:06] raising our hands in worship
[1:02:09] all right amen
[1:02:11] i just want to turn to psalms 134 verse
[1:02:15] two
[1:02:24] hey
[1:02:26] so psalms
[1:02:28] 134 versus two it says david i think
[1:02:32] amen who believes that david loved to
[1:02:34] worship and i believe david loved
[1:02:35] whispering
[1:02:37] so his he has a lot of psalms about
[1:02:39] worshiping god i mean it's quite it's
[1:02:40] it's a blessing
[1:02:42] to him he says here lift up your hands
[1:02:44] on the sanctuary and bless the lord i
[1:02:46] mean he's stating lift up your hands and
[1:02:48] then you know bless the lord amen amen
[1:02:52] and then if we could turn to psalms
[1:02:54] 28 verses 2
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] john 28 verse 2 it says hear this hear
[1:03:03] the voice of my supplications when i cry
[1:03:05] unto thee when i lift my hands toward
[1:03:08] thy holy oracle again he's stating amen
[1:03:11] lifting up lifting up our hands
[1:03:14] amen and if we go to
[1:03:16] um nehemiah 8 and 6.
[1:03:23] nehemiah and 6 says and ezra bless the
[1:03:26] lord the great god and all the people
[1:03:28] answered amen amen with lifting up their
[1:03:31] hands
[1:03:32] and they bowed their heads
[1:03:35] and worshiped the lord with their faces
[1:03:36] to the ground amen again so we
[1:03:39] they are lifting up their hands in in
[1:03:41] worship
[1:03:42] if we go to um limitations
[1:03:45] limitations 2 and 19.
[1:03:54] let's get there
[1:03:58] 2 and 19
[1:04:00] says arise cry out in the night and the
[1:04:03] beginning
[1:04:04] of the watchers pour out thine heart
[1:04:06] like water before the face of the lord
[1:04:08] said lift up by hands toward him for the
[1:04:11] life of my young children that faint for
[1:04:13] hunger in the top of every street
[1:04:16] i mean again lifting lifting up their
[1:04:18] hands
[1:04:19] i think that this was a this was a an
[1:04:22] absolute place they must have been
[1:04:23] imagining that presence lifting up your
[1:04:25] hands in such a
[1:04:26] a scary scary place and then if we go to
[1:04:29] go to exodus
[1:04:30] 17
[1:04:33] and we'll read verses 9-11 i really like
[1:04:35] this one
[1:04:52] so if we go exodus it's nine and
[1:04:55] nine to eleven
[1:04:57] and it says here and moses said unto
[1:04:59] joshua choose us out men and go
[1:05:03] out fight with amalek tomorrow i will
[1:05:06] stand on the top of the hill with the
[1:05:09] rod of god in my hand so joshua did as
[1:05:12] moses had said to him and fought with
[1:05:15] amalek and moses and moses aaron and her
[1:05:18] went up to the top of the hill
[1:05:21] and it came to pass
[1:05:22] moses
[1:05:23] held up his hand and israel prevailed
[1:05:25] amen so moses started winning when his
[1:05:27] hands were raised i mean how powerful is
[1:05:29] that i was searching the scriptures
[1:05:31] and i and i was thinking you know how am
[1:05:33] i gonna how am i gonna tell people you
[1:05:34] know to raise your hands in church but
[1:05:36] it says here and
[1:05:39] and um amen says here
[1:05:42] and when moses held up his hand israel
[1:05:44] prevailed
[1:05:45] and when he let down his hand amulek
[1:05:47] prevailed i mean so when worshipping
[1:05:49] we're winning when we're raising our
[1:05:50] hands i mean who believes that i mean
[1:05:52] that's so it's so that's that's what i
[1:05:55] was like i was like man what a powerful
[1:05:57] scripture i mean we we can we can win
[1:05:59] when we lift up our hands
[1:06:01] i mean
[1:06:02] so i just sort of be a good inspiration
[1:06:04] to people you know you come to church
[1:06:06] and you know you don't have to be down
[1:06:07] anymore you can lift up your hands and
[1:06:08] start winning amen we want to win oh
[1:06:11] hallelujah

[1:08:42] coming through isn't it all their own
[1:08:43] talent
[1:08:45] um i just
[1:08:47] titled my sermon having the mind of
[1:08:49] christ in god's economy
[1:08:52] it's actually a bit of a bible study too
[1:08:53] so i'm glad that i wasn't the only one
[1:08:55] thinking that so we're gonna i'm gonna
[1:08:57] start off with um acts chapter two
[1:09:00] one to four
[1:09:08] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:09:10] come
[1:09:11] they were all with one accord in one
[1:09:13] place
[1:09:15] and suddenly came
[1:09:17] a sound from heaven as a mighty rushing
[1:09:19] wind that filled the house
[1:09:22] where they were sitting and there
[1:09:23] appeared unto them cloven tongues of
[1:09:26] fire and it sat
[1:09:28] upon each of them and they were filled
[1:09:29] with the holy ghost and they again to
[1:09:31] speak with
[1:09:33] other tongues as a spirit gave them
[1:09:35] utterance oh excuse me i just got to get
[1:09:37] my phone
[1:09:46] so i would like yeah i'm preaching a lot
[1:09:48] about the mind i think i'm going to try
[1:09:50] switch it to god's economy
[1:09:52] um yeah
[1:09:55] as a spirit it was the spirit of god in
[1:09:56] truth it gave the utterance but it was
[1:09:58] with
[1:09:59] they when the when the holy ghost fell
[1:10:00] they were in one mind and i searched up
[1:10:02] in the greek and that
[1:10:05] uh
[1:10:08] with one mind is to be with with one
[1:10:10] mind one accord with one passion they
[1:10:12] are all together they're in truth
[1:10:13] they're in one spirit they're all
[1:10:14] believing in jesus christ
[1:10:16] and they waited there for 40 days i
[1:10:18] think it was 500 invited and there was
[1:10:20] only 120 they were there they received
[1:10:22] and they waited until they got in one
[1:10:24] accord and that's when the holy ghost
[1:10:25] fell
[1:10:26] um
[1:10:28] so
[1:10:30] with wanaka we all need to be in one
[1:10:32] accord you know they like we can't have
[1:10:33] orts against each other like little
[1:10:35] things no no praise the lord if if
[1:10:37] someone's carnal we're just gonna we
[1:10:39] just gotta forgive them and move on in
[1:10:40] the situation we can't hold resentments
[1:10:43] in this day and age we're writing a new
[1:10:44] book of acts we're moving forward
[1:10:46] and we have to have the mind of christ
[1:10:48] in us
[1:10:49] i'd like to go to philippians
[1:10:54] 2
[1:10:57] two to six i think
[1:10:59] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[1:11:02] having the same love being of one accord
[1:11:05] and of one mind let nothing be done
[1:11:07] through strife or
[1:11:09] vain or glory but in loneliness of mine
[1:11:12] let each esteem other better than
[1:11:14] themselves
[1:11:15] let not every man look on
[1:11:18] on his own things but every man unto the
[1:11:20] things of others
[1:11:22] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:11:24] jesus christ
[1:11:26] whom being in the form of god thought it
[1:11:29] not robbery to be equal with god
[1:11:31] it's a spirit of god that dwells within
[1:11:33] us when we've made new creations in
[1:11:34] christ
[1:11:36] it
[1:11:38] touched me quite a lot um
[1:11:41] when you think of the mind of christ in
[1:11:43] our minds he was so lowly though he came
[1:11:45] wrapped in maine
[1:11:47] born in a manger wrapped in spotting
[1:11:49] cloth like it's not very pleasant it was
[1:11:50] probably dirty and sweaty from
[1:11:52] the cows of the octopus shorts one it
[1:11:54] was but he was so that god that created
[1:11:57] everything that could have anything he
[1:11:59] wanted came so lowly to us to give us
[1:12:02] everything
[1:12:03] um
[1:12:04] and that was his mind as i preached
[1:12:06] about this i want to sort of just point
[1:12:08] out and through the scriptures how
[1:12:10] the lord's
[1:12:11] mind was
[1:12:13] um i would like to read a quote
[1:12:17] sorry i don't have any of this up there
[1:12:18] um
[1:12:20] from brother branham and
[1:12:22] disease and affliction is a bit wider
[1:12:23] when they've got this one
[1:12:25] um
[1:12:26] and
[1:12:27] i just read and it said and the sooner
[1:12:29] that our audience gets with one mind and
[1:12:31] one heart if the people if this group of
[1:12:33] people sitting here probably
[1:12:35] probably the ones
[1:12:37] that's to be prayed for tonight to come
[1:12:39] on the platform if they will be in one
[1:12:41] heart and one accord
[1:12:43] just in the next five minutes there
[1:12:44] won't be one of them in wheelchairs or
[1:12:46] costs
[1:12:47] if they'll believe that this is the
[1:12:49] truth the truth of the lord jesus christ
[1:12:51] with us dwelling in our souls when we're
[1:12:53] new creations believing not all maybe no
[1:12:56] believing
[1:12:59] and then as they come one by one tonight
[1:13:01] to the platform if they are each one not
[1:13:03] taken from those wheelchairs and cots
[1:13:04] and things
[1:13:05] and walk off this platform normal then
[1:13:07] you can say i'm wrong
[1:13:09] that night they all walked off the
[1:13:10] platform healed because the lord jesus
[1:13:12] was there with them
[1:13:13] that's his
[1:13:15] word um
[1:13:18] yeah really when when the scripture came
[1:13:21] i was like you know when he said be
[1:13:23] not robbery to be
[1:13:25] equal with god
[1:13:27] we're only equal with god through the
[1:13:28] blood of jesus christ through meekness
[1:13:30] and loneliness not thinking we you know
[1:13:32] being something it's it's being so
[1:13:34] humble to serve
[1:13:36] the lesser assembling them to be the
[1:13:38] better because that's what god did for
[1:13:40] each of us he gave his life he was
[1:13:42] bruised beaten whipped
[1:13:44] lived a life full of sorrow that i could
[1:13:46] have a nice tiny home a nice jug have a
[1:13:49] washing machine though he would have
[1:13:50] just washed his clothes real slow like
[1:13:53] that god did that for us
[1:13:56] um i'd like to jump across to
[1:13:57] philippians 4.
[1:14:01] four eight
[1:14:02] uh
[1:14:03] four yeah rejoice the lord always and
[1:14:06] again i say rejoice
[1:14:08] rejoice like a worship you're happy
[1:14:09] happy in the lord let all moderation be
[1:14:12] known unto all men that the lord is at
[1:14:14] hand be careful for nothing that in
[1:14:16] everything
[1:14:18] by prayer and supplication with
[1:14:19] thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:14:21] known unto god and the peace of god
[1:14:23] which passeth all understanding shall
[1:14:25] keep you
[1:14:26] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:14:28] jesus christ
[1:14:29] so
[1:14:31] there he's saying
[1:14:32] that he'll keep us
[1:14:34] through the minds of jesus christ so
[1:14:36] as kids as young ones we all have
[1:14:38] hobbies we all have what we want to do
[1:14:40] but the lord is clear saying here
[1:14:43] the lord will keep each one of you
[1:14:46] but we need to have our minds to jesus
[1:14:48] christ so we need to be thinking of how
[1:14:49] christ was and try and surrender and
[1:14:51] then the lord be like that through us in
[1:14:53] our lives finally brethren whatsoever
[1:14:55] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:14:57] honest whatever things are just
[1:15:00] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:15:02] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:15:03] of a good ah of good report if there be
[1:15:06] any virtue
[1:15:08] and if there be any praise think on
[1:15:10] these things
[1:15:11] so think positively with our minds we
[1:15:13] don't want to let negativity or oughts
[1:15:15] or
[1:15:16] anything that's ungodly come into our
[1:15:18] minds if we keep our minds on christ
[1:15:20] we will be
[1:15:22] moving forward with christ
[1:15:25] um
[1:15:26] i think it's the right time now to say
[1:15:28] uh all these quotes
[1:15:32] great arrivals us uh this is from um the
[1:15:34] children of israel great revivals are
[1:15:36] sweeping out across the country the
[1:15:38] people are one heart and one of mine
[1:15:40] they are just sending one to one
[1:15:42] another's church
[1:15:44] let the people go wherever
[1:15:46] church they wish to go let them have
[1:15:48] their own preferences and whatever a
[1:15:50] person believes go ahead and believe
[1:15:51] that but don't criticize the other man
[1:15:54] that's it
[1:15:55] let
[1:15:56] let's stay together and serve god
[1:15:58] hallelujah
[1:16:01] so
[1:16:01] yeah
[1:16:03] when i was writing this
[1:16:04] anytime there was a healing service or
[1:16:06] revival everybody got in one heart one
[1:16:08] mind one accord with the spirit of truth
[1:16:10] that's that's how it happened even in
[1:16:12] jesus day they they believed in the lord
[1:16:17] praise the lord i'm just going to move
[1:16:18] on to colossians now over the page
[1:16:22] three one to four
[1:16:24] i think
[1:16:30] if you then be risen
[1:16:32] seek those things which are above
[1:16:35] which christ sitteth
[1:16:37] with christ is on the right hand of god
[1:16:39] set your affections on things above
[1:16:41] not on things of the earth for ye
[1:16:44] for ye are dead and your life is hit
[1:16:46] with christ and god when christ who is
[1:16:51] uh
[1:16:52] our our life shall appear then shall ye
[1:16:55] also appear with him in glory
[1:17:05] the reason i'm bringing this forward is
[1:17:08] oh sorry there's caramel at all
[1:17:10] um so now i want to go down to nine lie
[1:17:13] not one to another seeing that you have
[1:17:15] put off this old man with his deeds 10.
[1:17:19] and
[1:17:20] he put on a new man which
[1:17:22] is renewed in knowledge after the image
[1:17:24] of him that
[1:17:26] created him and we know god created us
[1:17:29] and
[1:17:30] why i brought this forward and why i
[1:17:31] wanted to say this is
[1:17:33] when we
[1:17:34] the lord wants our minds to be on him
[1:17:37] he's saying he'll lie not one to another
[1:17:39] the old man's been put off don't look
[1:17:41] back to the old man how the old man was
[1:17:42] look on what christ wants us to have
[1:17:45] crisis in the bible christ the whole
[1:17:47] bible tells us what the mind of christ
[1:17:49] was like from when jesus was born
[1:17:51] until when he was crucified he
[1:17:54] subjected and submitted himself to the
[1:17:56] will of god no matter how much pain it
[1:17:58] cost him no matter what where he went
[1:18:00] like he went to the time of the pharisee
[1:18:02] and he was humiliated but he
[1:18:05] in himself he probably would have known
[1:18:06] that because he would have known the
[1:18:07] character of simon and where simon come
[1:18:10] from but he had the mind of christ and
[1:18:11] he went and that was to us you know that
[1:18:14] was a role model people are going to
[1:18:15] make fun of us when we make our stand
[1:18:17] but that's right have the mind of christ
[1:18:19] and christ will be with us
[1:18:24] i want to move on to
[1:18:27] timothy
[1:18:29] timothy 1 6 to 7 i believe
[1:18:35] second timothy sorry
[1:18:39] i don't know how you go i don't know how
[1:18:40] you ministers do they say this is real
[1:18:42] nerve-wracking stuff
[1:18:52] six to 7 i believe i believe i'm in the
[1:18:55] right place now
[1:19:10] wherefore i put
[1:19:12] thee in remembrance that you steer stir
[1:19:14] up the gift of god which is in thee
[1:19:17] by putting on
[1:19:19] of my hands
[1:19:20] for god hath not given us a spirit of
[1:19:22] fear but this but of power and of love
[1:19:26] and of a sound mind
[1:19:30] in our minds the majority like
[1:19:33] god is love so our mind should dwell a
[1:19:35] lot on love it shouldn't dwell on fear
[1:19:37] and negativity
[1:19:38] that we don't want to put our minds onto
[1:19:40] what the devil has to offer because it's
[1:19:42] not our portion at all god's going to
[1:19:44] bring us through great things but if if
[1:19:46] we dwell on fear or negativity or what
[1:19:48] the devil will do to us we will never
[1:19:50] really
[1:19:51] overcome that because we dwell on the
[1:19:53] positives of god
[1:19:55] what has
[1:19:56] what he said what his promises to us are
[1:20:00] praise the lord um
[1:20:02] with the mind of christ i want to keep
[1:20:03] on moving forward
[1:20:05] and
[1:20:07] move to a a compassion part
[1:20:09] um i want to
[1:20:11] go to matthew
[1:20:13] 15 30 32
[1:20:16] jesus in his mind here great compassion
[1:20:18] for people um
[1:20:20] so
[1:20:21] oh
[1:20:25] uh jesus here was um
[1:20:28] a whole lot of people come away and he
[1:20:30] was preaching to them and it says here
[1:20:33] and a great multitude came unto him
[1:20:35] having with him those that were lame
[1:20:37] blind dumb man and many others and were
[1:20:39] cast down at the feet of jesus and he
[1:20:41] healed them
[1:20:42] and so much at the multitude wondered
[1:20:44] where when they saw the dumb to speak
[1:20:47] the man to be whole and the lame to walk
[1:20:50] in the blind sea and they glorified the
[1:20:52] god of israel so that in their minds
[1:20:54] they knew that this was god those people
[1:20:55] that were healed they knew it was
[1:20:57] then jesus came and jesus called his
[1:21:00] disciples unto him and said i have
[1:21:01] compassion on the multitude because they
[1:21:03] continue with me now for three days and
[1:21:05] have nothing to eat
[1:21:06] and i will not send them away fasting at
[1:21:08] least they faint in the way so here god
[1:21:11] healed them
[1:21:13] and then he had compassion because they
[1:21:15] stayed and didn't want to go away and he
[1:21:16] wanted to feed them and hit compassion
[1:21:18] for them he didn't just not care for
[1:21:19] them he fed his children down here it
[1:21:21] says you know he has
[1:21:23] seven loaves and some fishes and he fed
[1:21:26] the multitude and there was still seven
[1:21:27] baskets left
[1:21:31] which is a great thing that he actually
[1:21:32] kid he cared to feed everybody not just
[1:21:35] a little bit they had leftovers and it's
[1:21:38] the same in our day too you know we
[1:21:39] don't just have a little bit of food
[1:21:41] brother branham gave us so much food
[1:21:42] like if you want to overcome and live
[1:21:44] overcoming life you can everything the
[1:21:46] prophet said you can walk into by faith
[1:21:49] and walk into this rapture
[1:21:50] we all have to get in one mind one
[1:21:52] accord and worship in the spirit of
[1:21:54] truth
[1:21:57] um just a comparison of the scripture
[1:21:59] mark
[1:22:00] 6 24. brother ben gave me this one just
[1:22:02] before
[1:22:04] mark 6 and 24
[1:22:07] i
[1:22:08] think 34 sorry
[1:22:13] and jesus when he came out saw much
[1:22:16] people and was moved
[1:22:17] with compassion towards him because they
[1:22:19] were as sheep not having a shepherd and
[1:22:21] he began to teach them many things this
[1:22:24] compassion
[1:22:25] i thought about that how he was moved to
[1:22:27] compassion for us
[1:22:28] to feed us
[1:22:32] and
[1:22:34] i think with our minds taking on the
[1:22:36] minds of christ being made new means
[1:22:38] with christ we should have compassion
[1:22:40] too for people when we see friends that
[1:22:42] are struggling or in the world you know
[1:22:44] doing worldly things they're hungry
[1:22:46] they go home
[1:22:48] forgive me if this is wrong or they
[1:22:49] drink and smoke and they're trying to
[1:22:50] fill a void of god because they're
[1:22:51] hungry and they don't have any rest and
[1:22:54] we should have compassion on them we
[1:22:55] should we should bring them
[1:22:58] before the lord with prayer and
[1:22:59] supplication of fasting and ask and try
[1:23:01] to win them in the spiritual world that
[1:23:02] god would
[1:23:03] open their eyes that they would see they
[1:23:05] would take a word and do season and take
[1:23:07] on the minor christ too and god would
[1:23:08] reveal himself to them
[1:23:12] i want to move forward
[1:23:14] to romans
[1:23:20] romans chapter 8
[1:23:22] 35
[1:23:28] chapter romans 8 35
[1:23:33] i'm not sure i'm not sure if i supposed
[1:23:34] to read this one first or ten but
[1:23:36] we'll do it
[1:23:42] for who shall separate us from the love
[1:23:43] of christ shall tribulations or distress
[1:23:45] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:23:48] prevail of the sword
[1:23:53] um and i was going to go to think ten
[1:23:55] times in with this
[1:23:56] ten verse one
[1:23:58] uh
[1:24:01] i know
[1:24:06] 10 verse heading for whoever shall call
[1:24:08] upon the name of the lord shall be saved
[1:24:10] this is a promise and when it anchors in
[1:24:12] your mind
[1:24:14] that whoever calls upon the name of the
[1:24:16] lord will be saved that's god's promise
[1:24:18] to us and
[1:24:19] when i want to go back to x uh nah uh
[1:24:22] sorry
[1:24:23] sorry forgive me uh 8 35
[1:24:27] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:24:29] christ like who shall who's going to
[1:24:31] come against us that's more powerful
[1:24:32] than god if we have the same mind of
[1:24:34] christ nothing will stand
[1:24:36] in front of us before us against us
[1:24:38] satan won't come into this church and
[1:24:39] break this church up with some little
[1:24:40] bickering or some gossip because we're
[1:24:42] going to be in one mind of one accord
[1:24:44] and if someone does that we're going to
[1:24:45] have the same line of christ and forgive
[1:24:47] them we're not going to wait until they
[1:24:49] come and go can you forgive us because
[1:24:50] the the lord's prayer said didn't go
[1:24:52] forgive them when they asked forgive and
[1:24:53] said forgive them and you shall be
[1:24:55] forgiven don't don't wait don't hold it
[1:24:57] just let it go because if someone does
[1:24:59] upset you it's only the devil trying to
[1:25:01] get them amongst us to cause assurance
[1:25:03] so the spirit of god can't move and
[1:25:04] that's we don't want it at all we want
[1:25:06] god to move powerfully in our lives and
[1:25:08] our families lives and we want to call
[1:25:10] on the name of the lord for our families
[1:25:12] for our loved ones for our friends and
[1:25:14] we can't let unforgiveness hold that and
[1:25:16] the mind of christ he teaches in this
[1:25:17] bible that we have to have the same
[1:25:19] amount of wonderful that he had he
[1:25:20] didn't like
[1:25:23] the one when when the people came to get
[1:25:25] jesus and crucify him one of the
[1:25:27] pharisees or roman soldiers cut off
[1:25:29] peter's ear he didn't go that was a very
[1:25:31] nice you know how do you do that to my
[1:25:33] disciple he picked up his ncaa peter we
[1:25:34] don't fight in this world like that we
[1:25:36] forgive them and we've got to be
[1:25:38] christ-like to them yeah and that was
[1:25:40] that was the money you know like
[1:25:41] if someone cut off my mates he'll be
[1:25:43] pretty i'll be pretty upset you know i'd
[1:25:44] struggle to pick it up and say hey don't
[1:25:46] do that you know
[1:25:47] remember the word forgive
[1:25:49] is the ears cut off you'd be pretty
[1:25:52] taking on the mind of christ it's a it's
[1:25:53] a life of surrender
[1:25:55] push forward it is well worth it the
[1:25:57] lord will bless you and keep you amen
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:02] it's by faith we believe um
[1:26:04] now
[1:26:05] he's come i want to tie us into god's
[1:26:07] economy when we're made
[1:26:08] new creatures in christ we switch from
[1:26:11] working in
[1:26:12] satan's economy and we move into working
[1:26:14] into god's economy
[1:26:15] and in god's economy we work by faith
[1:26:18] we don't
[1:26:20] we don't it's not by our understanding
[1:26:22] we do or reasoning it's by the word of
[1:26:24] god that we do it
[1:26:25] um i have some scriptures but i just
[1:26:27] want to
[1:26:29] talk for a bit
[1:26:30] um
[1:26:32] when i came in you know i just came to
[1:26:34] wellington started working the lord
[1:26:35] provided i was in god's economy i
[1:26:37] believed by faith and i prayed
[1:26:41] i know i know there's a powerful teacher
[1:26:43] in the church and brothers are
[1:26:44] struggling they don't in business this
[1:26:46] is hard because when his home when you
[1:26:48] can't feed your children or pay your
[1:26:49] rent
[1:26:50] things are going downhill you don't stop
[1:26:51] paying your tithes you pay your tithes
[1:26:53] the lord will take hold of it satan's
[1:26:55] economy runs by money god's economy runs
[1:26:58] by
[1:26:58] love and we can never try to cross them
[1:27:01] over because if we try across out god's
[1:27:03] economy and rely on satan's economy
[1:27:04] things won't go well for us in our
[1:27:06] families or in our lives but believe in
[1:27:08] god and he will he'll he'll be your
[1:27:10] savior keep you out of trouble
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:15] i want to go to first kings i want to
[1:27:16] tie us to the scripture so it's not just
[1:27:18] me speaking it um
[1:27:20] i was actually in new plymouth yesterday
[1:27:22] and this dude just came along started
[1:27:24] talking about this stuff and i was like
[1:27:25] and was the law would say i want you to
[1:27:26] switch this and you need a sermon it was
[1:27:28] very i was real powerful i could feel
[1:27:29] god there talking to me
[1:27:30] um so first king 17.
[1:27:34] i want to sort of type it to jezebel and
[1:27:36] ahab and
[1:27:39] elijah
[1:27:40] yeah first king 171-5 and elijah the
[1:27:42] tisha by
[1:27:44] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[1:27:46] said unto ahab as are the children out
[1:27:49] as the lord god of israel liveth before
[1:27:51] whom i stand there shall not be jew or
[1:27:54] reign these three years but according to
[1:27:56] my word
[1:27:58] and the word of the lord came unto him
[1:28:00] saying get thee hints
[1:28:05] he get the hands and turn eastwood and
[1:28:07] hide thyself by the brook cherith that
[1:28:09] is before jordan and it's and it shall
[1:28:12] be that they shalt drink from the brooks
[1:28:14] that i have commanded the ravens to feed
[1:28:16] thee so he went and did according unto
[1:28:18] the word of the lord and he went and
[1:28:20] dwelt by the brook
[1:28:23] this is when um yeah i'm sure it's a
[1:28:25] familiar piece of scripture
[1:28:26] he called for a famine oh for no rain
[1:28:29] which no food will grow and the lord
[1:28:31] provided
[1:28:32] and we can tie it to this day and age
[1:28:33] you know you want to do something we
[1:28:35] need the lord to provide we need the
[1:28:36] lord to feed for us we're not
[1:28:38] we're not we're not trying to go about
[1:28:40] and do our own will we want the lord's
[1:28:42] will in our lives and the lord will feed
[1:28:43] us a word of due season or feed our
[1:28:45] families or feed our loved ones we rely
[1:28:47] on the lord so he called for this
[1:28:50] there'll be no rain
[1:28:51] and
[1:28:53] he went down to
[1:28:55] he went down to a woman just over the
[1:28:58] uh the widow woman
[1:29:01] and she had no oil left she was pretty
[1:29:02] much in a last feed and he just and the
[1:29:05] god had told him
[1:29:07] passive
[1:29:08] your
[1:29:19] 9 16. arise and get there too
[1:29:22] zaripath
[1:29:24] which belongeth to zidane and dwelleth
[1:29:26] there
[1:29:27] behold i've commanded a widow woman
[1:29:29] there to sustain thee so he rose and
[1:29:31] went to zara
[1:29:33] and when he went and cut to the gate of
[1:29:35] the city behold the witter woman was
[1:29:37] there gathering the sticks and he called
[1:29:39] to her and said fetch me i pray thee a
[1:29:41] little water and a vessel that i might
[1:29:43] drink
[1:29:44] and as she was going to fetch it he
[1:29:46] called unto her and said bring me i pray
[1:29:48] thee a morsel of bread in my hand and he
[1:29:50] said
[1:29:51] and
[1:29:52] she said
[1:29:53] as the lord thy god liveth
[1:29:55] i have not a cake but a handful of meal
[1:29:57] and a barrel and a little oil in a
[1:29:59] cruise
[1:30:01] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[1:30:03] that i may go in to
[1:30:04] go in and dress it for me and my son
[1:30:06] that we might eat and die and elijah
[1:30:08] said unto her fear not
[1:30:10] go and do it as thou has said but make
[1:30:13] me thereof
[1:30:15] a little cake first and bring it unto me
[1:30:18] and after make for thee my son
[1:30:21] so in this in this
[1:30:23] in the spout of no rain no food
[1:30:25] the lord fed his prophet
[1:30:27] the lord that prophet was running on his
[1:30:29] economy but he also sent down his
[1:30:31] prophet to someone
[1:30:33] in that time they had no food they
[1:30:36] weren't running in god's economy because
[1:30:38] they had no food
[1:30:39] but he said give me some food
[1:30:41] and then he said
[1:30:42] i think you go down these he got um they
[1:30:44] went and got all their pots and filled
[1:30:46] up with oil and they were sustained for
[1:30:48] a time so the prophet's measures came
[1:30:50] down in the age
[1:30:51] and gave us a whole lot of oil that we
[1:30:53] would feed on that would be running on
[1:30:55] god's economy and we can type that until
[1:30:57] today we're running on god's economy the
[1:30:59] brother branham has filled up all
[1:31:01] all the um tapes
[1:31:03] and we have a word in due season when
[1:31:05] we're struggling we're running on god's
[1:31:07] economy and it's not it's not a great
[1:31:09] mystery that we are when we pray we
[1:31:11] believe by faith this is god's economy
[1:31:13] running and we've got to just keep our
[1:31:14] minds
[1:31:16] on god's economy and not try running
[1:31:19] around doing all these things in the
[1:31:20] world because
[1:31:21] god has got each and every one of us
[1:31:23] young children a job where he wants us
[1:31:25] what he wants to say to people what he
[1:31:27] wants us to do so we just need to bear
[1:31:28] in mind that the lord has given us all
[1:31:31] the food
[1:31:33] stay in one mind
[1:31:35] and want to call with the spirit of god
[1:31:37] and let him lead you
[1:31:39] and everything will be good and we're
[1:31:40] going to rapture soon but there's there
[1:31:42] is things to do there is lost souls out
[1:31:44] there we need to be have prayer and
[1:31:46] supplication this new man has it needs
[1:31:48] to have the mind of christ
[1:31:50] and we need to really push forward
[1:31:51] because
[1:31:52] the battle is hot the devil's angry he
[1:31:55] will try to overcome and kill anybody
[1:31:57] anybody
[1:31:58] um
[1:31:59] with this
[1:32:01] with the um with this mind of god the
[1:32:03] scripture i had to conclude my sermon
[1:32:05] dave ready so we're gonna go there
[1:32:06] anyway the fruit of the spirit galatians
[1:32:08] 5 22.
[1:32:16] joshua
[1:32:30] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:32:31] peace long suffering gentleness goodness
[1:32:34] faith meekness temperance against the
[1:32:35] sun
[1:32:36] against such there is no law
[1:32:39] the mind of christ
[1:32:40] this is the mind of christ having all
[1:32:42] these gifts opera in our life not having
[1:32:44] a hate mail or strife above here
[1:32:47] the mind of the devil you could say is
[1:32:48] idolatry witchcraft hatred variancy
[1:32:50] emulations wrath strife
[1:32:54] seed editions here see indians
[1:32:57] murders drunkenness revelings
[1:33:00] the lord in his bible
[1:33:02] has showed us how to have the mind of
[1:33:04] christ and he has firmly pointed out how
[1:33:06] not to have the mind of christ
[1:33:08] he's told us to do in the don'ts but
[1:33:10] there's love and compassion for us we
[1:33:12] just need to read the word
[1:33:15] ask the lord to come give us the same
[1:33:17] mind that he had
[1:33:19] and understand how he was because that's
[1:33:21] how he wants us to be and when we are
[1:33:23] lowly and meek and humble and have the
[1:33:25] gifts of the spirit operating in our
[1:33:26] lives people see there's something
[1:33:28] different about us when you give someone
[1:33:30] that you
[1:33:31] give something to somebody you only just
[1:33:32] have or just brought and they want it or
[1:33:34] and you bless somebody they see
[1:33:36] something different in you they see a
[1:33:37] real christian
[1:33:39] there's lots of fake christians in this
[1:33:40] world and people i meet people every day
[1:33:42] and they they're not real christians and
[1:33:44] other worldly people look at them and
[1:33:45] they they hate christianity and hate
[1:33:47] religions because of fake christians and
[1:33:49] the devil has
[1:33:51] tricked this world in such a way that
[1:33:53] they believe there's nothing to it i
[1:33:54] mean history points to it but it's
[1:33:56] because there's a religious spirit going
[1:33:57] around deceiving everybody in the mind
[1:34:00] the greatest battle is for in the mind
[1:34:02] before you ever go to do anything
[1:34:04] that you're ready the devil's either
[1:34:06] battled you in the mind and you've
[1:34:07] redecided what you're going to do
[1:34:10] so keep your mind on christ keep your
[1:34:11] affections on christ and the lord will
[1:34:13] lead you
[1:34:14] god bless you young children
[1:34:17] there's a work for you to do god will

[1:38:41] rapture as a body as a church
[1:38:43] of believers
[1:38:45] i just miss this one i'd like to say to
[1:38:46] you when brother branham was preaching
[1:38:48] at thy word
[1:38:50] he said and it is psychological
[1:38:52] or psychology in one way it's
[1:38:55] it's the mind of christ and the
[1:38:56] christian moving see it's not our mind
[1:38:58] not our psychology
[1:39:00] but the power of christ his mind let the
[1:39:02] mind of christ be in you see and then it
[1:39:05] moves out and knows not the man but
