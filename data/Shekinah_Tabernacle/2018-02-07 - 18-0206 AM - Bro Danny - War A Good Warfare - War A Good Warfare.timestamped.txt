[18:25] the wooing it's when a guy is really
[18:27] interested in a girl he'll do everything

[22:48] practical gospel amen the gospel of
[22:51] Jesus Christ is a gospel unto salvation
[22:54] amen if this gospel can't save us and
[22:57] hold us and keep us and help us know how
[22:59] to live and to make practical decisions
[23:02] common-sense decisions it's the wrong
[23:04] gospel and this sound of gospel where we

[23:31] heart and a burden I mean that's not
[23:33] your burden God placed it upon you it's
[23:34] his burden when Nehemiah went around the
[23:37] walls and was looking at the walls and
[23:38] it's Psalm all in there tore down
[23:40] condition he was desiring to build up
[23:43] the walls again but that was God's
[23:44] burden that had been placed upon him and

[24:24] help the young people as they leave this
[24:26] place Lord not as camp-meeting stars not

[24:30] grounds but as they go forth into life
[24:33] soldiers that have been equipped Lord I
[24:36] pray your help them father strengthen
[24:39] them in the days that are coming whether

[25:36] response gets a little bit further out
[25:38] so hey man I'll say something now and
[25:41] expect you to a minute in five minutes
[25:43] amen all right I'm gonna read to you
[25:45] first Timothy one in the fifteenth verse
[25:48] this is a faithful saying and worthy of
[25:51] all acceptation that Christ Jesus came
[25:54] into the world to save sinners of whom I
[25:57] am chief howbeit for this cause I
[26:00] obtained mercy that in me first Jesus
[26:04] Christ might show forth all
[26:06] long-suffering
[26:07] for a pattern to them which should
[26:10] hereafter believe on him to life
[26:12] everlasting
[26:14] now under the king eternal I want you to
[26:17] think about that statement that Paul
[26:18] said that God has done something in me
[26:20] that'll be a pattern to all Hereafter
[26:24] that's what God wants to do with your
[26:26] life your life will be a pattern for
[26:29] those coming up behind you that's why we
[26:32] have these meetings amen that God can
[26:35] place that eternal Amen at eternal
[26:38] something in you that will cause you to
[26:40] have straight paths and the Word of God
[26:42] will be a lamp into your feet because
[26:44] others are watching us now under the
[26:47] king eternal immortal invisible the only
[26:49] wise God be honor and glory for ever and
[26:51] ever amen
[26:52] this charge commit eye unto these son
[26:56] Timothy according to the prophecies
[27:01] which went before on thee that thou by
[27:06] them might as war a good warfare Paul's
[27:12] telling Timothy God has not left you
[27:15] without a resource
[27:16] there's things that's been preached
[27:19] prophecies that have been made that you
[27:22] use them to war this warfare you see
[27:28] it's not that God has touched us and we
[27:30] go and say God now I'm gonna expect this
[27:32] feeling to last and I'm gonna expect
[27:35] this anointing that I feel upon me to
[27:37] feel like it was when I came and gave my
[27:40] heart to the Lord or asked him to fill
[27:41] me with the Holy Ghost no but you have
[27:44] to learn how
[27:45] war a warfare many of you outers can say
[27:50] amen to that
[27:51] brother branham's said this is not a bed
[27:54] of roses this is not a picnic this is a
[27:56] battlefield and Satan will study how you
[28:00] use the Bible how you use the message in
[28:06] your life and if you don't use it and if
[28:09] you don't pray he's got you whipped
[28:11] before you even walk out these doors
[28:14] there's not gonna be any say sustaining
[28:17] power the Holy Ghost
[28:19] how many have the Holy Ghost feeds on
[28:23] the Word of God holding faith and good
[28:28] conscience which some have him put away
[28:30] concerning faith and made shipwreck you
[28:32] can be seated may the Lord bless the
[28:34] reading of his word just real shortly we
[28:36] just have just a few minutes and we're
[28:39] up it gets a hard time line if the Lord
[28:42] if the Lord can I just want to give you
[28:44] some practical words of advice as a
[28:46] minister and as a pastor I'm no greater
[28:53] than you I'm a minister and a minister
[28:56] as a servant sometimes ministers can can
[28:59] seem like they're unapproachable
[29:01] sometimes ministers can try to place
[29:03] themself up itself upon a plane or upon
[29:07] a place where it's hard for somebody to
[29:09] relate to their life but ministers are
[29:12] just the same as you they're all humans
[29:14] we're all humans gifts and callings or
[29:17] without repentance every gift in this
[29:20] room must be subject to correction every
[29:25] gift every calling must be subject to
[29:28] correction we're all subject to
[29:29] correction so what I tell you is when
[29:31] you leave here you're gonna make
[29:33] mistakes you're going to stumble may go
[29:36] backwards a time or two but don't be
[29:39] weary of the correction if we cannot
[29:42] receive correction that's why every
[29:44] minister must first sit under a ministry
[29:46] they first must learn and be able to
[29:50] subject themselves to the ministry
[29:52] otherwise they're not worthy to preach
[29:53] the gospel because they're gonna have to
[29:55] bring correction themselves they're
[29:57] gonna have to be able to say things
[29:58] that'll correct and rebuke and no
[30:00] ministers worthy of doing that unless he
[30:02] himself has first received correction
[30:05] and rebuke can you say men and so we all
[30:07] Amen must learn our place in the body of
[30:10] Christ that we have a place that God a
[30:13] man has ordained for you and nobody can
[30:15] take that place but I want to tell you
[30:17] God has equipped you goddess gave you a
[30:21] weapon and and we read in the Bible in
[30:24] the book of Judges there is a there was
[30:26] the son of Gideon the oldest son his
[30:27] name was Jethro
[30:28] he had a sword on his side in the day of
[30:31] battle and his father had one great
[30:34] victory after great victory against
[30:36] overwhelming odds amen he took 300 men
[30:39] and defeated over a quarter million on a
[30:42] man army it man that's not a small
[30:46] battle that's a great victory and there
[30:49] was no doubt that God had won the
[30:52] victory they could not have won that 300
[30:54] men against a quarter-million men but
[30:56] they done it because they followed the
[30:58] instruction of God amen now he had a son
[31:01] as as Gideon has the men on the run a
[31:04] man he runs them and he captures the two
[31:07] leaders the two kings amen and he brings
[31:10] him to his son and he asks his son pull
[31:13] your weapon and slay them okay God is
[31:18] going to ask you when you leave here to
[31:21] use the swords that you've got use what
[31:25] I have given you now here's a man a
[31:27] young man he's equipped he's got a sword
[31:30] amen but the Bible said he didn't do it
[31:33] because he was afraid because he was a
[31:37] youth amen your youth does not mean you
[31:42] cannot overcome brother daddy it's just
[31:45] too hard you're equipped I've got strong
[31:49] temptations in my life you're equipped
[31:52] God has given you a sword a sort of
[31:56] faith amen the sword of the Spirit that
[32:00] will divide asunder and it'll cut out
[32:02] everything brother BAM said it takes a
[32:04] strong hand of faith to hold that sword
[32:07] to the heart of the enemy well this
[32:09] young man was afraid so he didn't pull
[32:11] his
[32:12] and you know what happened to him the
[32:14] next chapter
[32:15] amen his a half brother of his born by
[32:21] illegitimate she rose up and took over
[32:24] the throne took over the the kingship
[32:27] and he killed all of his brothers but
[32:29] the youngest that means jeffer lost his
[32:32] life because he refused to take a stand
[32:35] amen he was equipped but he was
[32:37] anonymous you know what anonymous means
[32:39] and no difference he's not a difference
[32:41] maker so you can either be equipped and
[32:44] anonymous so you can being equipped to
[32:46] overcome I say this this morning you're
[32:49] equipped to overcome you're equipped to
[32:52] go out there and fight these battles are
[32:53] gonna face you I don't know your battles
[32:55] but God knows your battles but he's
[32:56] equipped you now amen there's a lesson
[32:59] we learned from Rome Rome was the
[33:00] mightiest army on the face of the earth
[33:04] they were unstoppable
[33:06] but they were unstoppable because of
[33:08] their training and because of their
[33:11] discipline and then they were
[33:13] unstoppable but there's something
[33:15] happened with Rome Josephus said you've
[33:17] heard of Josephus he was the Jewish
[33:18] historian he said that the soldiers
[33:22] always carried their weapons with them
[33:25] even in time of peace furthermore they
[33:30] practiced the use of that weapon it
[33:33] never ceased while they were a soldier
[33:38] so they always practiced every soldier
[33:43] every day exercised with great diligence
[33:46] as if they were in the time of war so
[33:53] you have to exercise what God has given
[33:55] you the thing is with their young people
[33:57] we expect that what happened right here
[34:00] to be the endgame it's not this is where
[34:04] God did a miraculous thing in your life
[34:06] by changing the way you were walking
[34:08] turn the way you were but your whole
[34:11] life is not going to be an altar call
[34:13] you've got to go out here and know what
[34:16] your confession meant and you can never
[34:18] stop confessing these people think
[34:21] confessing is only the negative I only
[34:23] confess my
[34:25] I only confess where I'm wrong I only
[34:26] confess no you have to have a negative
[34:29] confession in order to then start on
[34:31] your positive confession you have to
[34:34] confess positive you have to understand
[34:37] that this word was given to you to be an
[34:39] Oracle in your mouth that you speak the
[34:42] things of God that has been written here
[34:46] this is yours you know you you're not
[34:48] saved unless you first confess it we we
[34:54] salvation never comes before confession
[34:57] amen the scripture tells us that we
[35:00] confess unto salvation so you believe
[35:04] that God is you believe he's a savior
[35:07] and you begin to infest your sins to him
[35:09] see because you believe he's going to
[35:11] forgive you
[35:11] and then amen you begin to thank him for
[35:14] it then you begin to walk in it and
[35:17] every phase of your life must be with
[35:21] confession because salvation is not just
[35:25] changing you from a life of sin I mean
[35:27] he brings your salvation to a completion
[35:30] when were changed in our body so our
[35:33] whole life amen is confessing what God
[35:36] has already done he say men don't go out
[35:40] of here now and just say God where are
[35:41] you no begin to confess his word David
[35:44] wanted to build the temple he gathered
[35:46] all kinds of things he gathered all
[35:48] kinds of material he's going to build
[35:49] the temple that was his idea
[35:51] God had even revealed the pattern of the
[35:53] temple to him but then God come to him
[35:56] and he's praying and he's saying god I
[35:58] want to do this and God come to him
[36:00] through the prophet and said David
[36:01] you're not going to build the temple but
[36:03] one that comes out of you is going to
[36:05] build the temple and you know what David
[36:07] did he didn't keep praying Lord let me
[36:09] build the temple he changed the way he
[36:12] prayed and he said Lord do what you have
[36:16] said in your words now that is our
[36:19] ability every one of you have the
[36:21] ability to come to God and say God you
[36:24] said you established me you said you
[36:27] would strengthen me you said you'd give
[36:29] the ability in the word you said you
[36:32] would give me understanding Lord I need
[36:34] more revelation then look up and ask him
[36:36] for more revelation don't just sit there
[36:38] and go in a circle
[36:40] exercise your weapon know the words Amen
[36:47] ask God to give you a spirit of truth
[36:50] because that is the Holy Ghost not a
[36:52] spirit of truth these spirit of truth
[36:54] let it come in and sees in your life
[36:58] because if your life isn't seasoned it's
[37:01] gonna cause damage in the body an
[37:02] unseasoned minister will cause problems
[37:06] in the body if i'm unseasoned the way I
[37:08] handle the word I can kill you where I
[37:11] should be giving your life come on
[37:14] Church it's not here I'm not here to
[37:17] announce hey I'm gonna I'm a minister
[37:19] look at me well glory to God who cares
[37:22] you know what that means nothing how
[37:27] many big shots we got in here ain't
[37:30] nobody who raised their hand now amen
[37:33] listen you're here by the grace of God
[37:36] you're here by what God has done for you
[37:37] I was nothing he pulled me up out of a
[37:40] pit now what I do back to him is in
[37:43] thankfulness for what he's done for me
[37:44] and if the shore come let me tell you if
[37:46] I don't tell you my shortcomings listen
[37:49] there's some things maybe in your life
[37:50] you as a minister you can't open up all
[37:53] the way just so that people will keep
[37:54] their respect but that's not what I'm
[37:56] talking about I have to relate to you my
[37:58] shortcomings I can't tell you every
[38:00] battle because sometimes you're part of
[38:01] the battle so if I told you everything
[38:05] in my life I'd be I'd probably putting
[38:08] you down you know what you really
[38:09] discouraged me some time I can't tell
[38:12] you that but if I begin to relate to you
[38:14] as a human because the last time I
[38:16] looked that's what I was I brushed my
[38:20] teeth this morning because my breath
[38:21] smell right well that's funny
[38:25] you can laugh we're all human here we
[38:30] all are the same and if we project
[38:32] ourselves if somebody's super spiritual
[38:34] I hear I can never help you because you
[38:36] can't trust that because you can't see
[38:38] yourself coming to that but let me
[38:40] preach to you like
[38:40] Paul said Paul said in me is an example
[38:43] for everyone a pattern to follow
[38:46] Hereafter and he had just gotten done
[38:48] saying I was the chief of sinners well
[38:51] everybody can relate to that and then he
[38:57] said in Ephesians we are now seated in
[39:00] heavenly places in Christ Jesus he took
[39:03] you from being a chief sinner all the
[39:05] way to glory as a minister that's what
[39:09] I'm called to do
[39:10] I am called I am called because
[39:12] everybody raised their hands
[39:14] I said raised it that's your faith keep
[39:20] it up your hand can of faith cannot
[39:24] reach out and take what the eye of faith
[39:27] cannot see so I have got to present this
[39:31] gospel to you in a way that you can see
[39:33] it for faith cometh by hearing and
[39:36] hearing the Word of God so you've got to
[39:38] be able to see it you got to be able to
[39:40] look to the unseen and be able to grab
[39:43] ahold of it and say God I see myself in
[39:46] that picture I don't just see my brother
[39:49] you can put your hand down now I don't
[39:51] see my sister I see myself there and
[39:54] Paul presented the word in such a way
[39:57] that they could see themselves in that
[39:59] word problem with too many camps we go
[40:03] out of here and we go right back to the
[40:05] way we are let me tell you you've got to
[40:07] exercise what's been you've been
[40:09] equipped with in this camp you've got to
[40:12] take your sword you've got a sharpening
[40:14] hey man you've got to work on it you got
[40:16] to practice how you use it
[40:18] why because Satan is watching you but
[40:23] you ever wondered what caused the
[40:26] downfall of Rome a generation rose up
[40:32] that begin to complain that the armor
[40:36] and the sword was too heavy
[40:43] because they begin to complain about
[40:45] their weapons in their Armour it changed
[40:48] the policy of the army and when they met
[40:53] Hannah born in the Gulf and all of these
[40:58] on the field they were defeated and they
[41:00] ran for their lives because they lost
[41:03] their discipline and lost respect
[41:06] because the armors too heavy it's just
[41:13] too hard it's not hard if you exercise
[41:17] in it you know I'm getting older you
[41:24] know I used to be fitter more fit than I
[41:31] am right now an age don't help me get
[41:34] more fit and I was in construction for
[41:39] 30 years and I began to pass her after a
[41:42] while I had to go full-time and I lost
[41:47] that edge of fitness that I had when I
[41:50] was working full-time with my with my
[41:53] hands now some people think being a
[41:57] preacher is not working it's like one
[42:00] minister in the state's Amen they're
[42:03] their children they at their school they
[42:05] they they have a kindergarten the kids
[42:08] all get up and get to tell what their
[42:10] father does for a job and so her father
[42:16] was an evangelist full time everybody
[42:20] else got up my father's a doctor my
[42:22] mother a nurse or some kind of
[42:25] occupation and this girl got up and said
[42:27] my dad's a preacher he doesn't do
[42:29] anything well you know I do do something
[42:36] but amen
[42:39] I I decided I'd go out and I'd go out
[42:42] and try to run a little bit because I'm
[42:44] getting I'm getting pretty unfit and I
[42:47] did man I thought my body was falling
[42:49] apart you know why I felt that way
[42:51] because I work out
[42:53] I weren't exercising it like I should
[42:55] have been my bones felt heavy
[42:59] my body was evie hey man my breath was
[43:02] gone you know and I always used to a man
[43:05] we got a lot of senior citizens in our
[43:06] area our city used to be the number one
[43:08] destination for for senior citizens in
[43:12] America
[43:13] Sarasota in Florida there so they had
[43:16] the saying about Florida they are
[43:17] Sarasota they either newly weds or
[43:19] nearly dead and it's close and I would I
[43:21] would see I would see people out there
[43:24] you know up in their seventy's running
[43:26] and they're going like this and I
[43:29] thought man they could probably do
[43:30] better than that
[43:31] well I'm not quite 50 and I could hardly
[43:33] do better than that so you you know you
[43:35] got to exercise got exercise what you
[43:39] got God has given you something amen
[43:43] amen
[43:44] I don't have to go to my children every
[43:47] day and reassure them that they are my
[43:50] sons they learn to get past the baby
[43:53] stage the parental care where I'm always
[43:56] patting them and saying you're a good
[43:57] boy and always have to need that
[43:59] reassurance amen now they're my sons
[44:01] they don't even have to knock on the
[44:03] door they just walk right on in they
[44:05] don't say dad can I be your boy today no
[44:07] they just come right on in you know my
[44:09] church has an office my church has an
[44:12] office and people want to come to that
[44:13] office many times I mean they knock or
[44:15] maybe one of the Deacons coming and they
[44:17] say hey so-and-so wants to see you but
[44:18] you know what my boy just walk right on
[44:20] in you know why are my sons and with
[44:26] that sonship comes a confidentiality a
[44:29] confidence that they know I mean there's
[44:31] a connection there by the blood a man
[44:33] that they can just walk right in and
[44:35] expect him and me to treat them like a
[44:38] father so the Romans sword and shield a
[44:46] man that had overwhelmed overwhelmed the
[44:50] world were thrown aside and they lost
[44:56] well I want to tell you something I want
[44:58] to read another scripture to you right
[44:59] quick I got just a few more minutes and
[45:04] in the book of Ephesians and I don't
[45:06] have you ever thought of this and I just
[45:08] want you to think about this for just a
[45:11] minute because Paul addresses that he
[45:15] says in the book of Ephesians a sixth
[45:17] chapter finally my brethren give up no
[45:24] he says be strong in the Lord and in the
[45:28] power of his might put on the whole
[45:32] armour of God that you may be able to
[45:35] stand against the wiles of the devil for
[45:39] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[45:42] but against principalities against
[45:44] powers against the rulers of the
[45:45] darkness of this world against spiritual
[45:48] wickedness in high places
[45:50] wherefore taken to you the whole armour
[45:53] of God that you may be able to withstand
[45:56] in the evil day how are you going to
[46:00] stand in this day by taking on the whole
[46:04] armour of God and having done all don't
[46:08] try to be more super spiritual now stand
[46:13] I'm gonna walk around with your head in
[46:15] the air
[46:15] don't let the message give you an
[46:17] arrogance cuz that's not the Holy Spirit
[46:23] amen
[46:25] when you've done all then you stand
[46:27] stand therefore having your loins Girt
[46:30] about but with the truth you know why
[46:32] why they're saying that's the first
[46:34] first thing he talks about in the armor
[46:37] of a Christian and other soldier is how
[46:39] they're belted because if you're belted
[46:42] with truth they were belted in such a
[46:43] way it gave them freedom of movement
[46:45] they weren't always afraid that they
[46:48] they were gonna have repercussions even
[46:50] if they did this or if they did that or
[46:52] didn't walk in timidity in fear Oh am I
[46:54] gonna displease the father they have
[46:57] confidence in what they were wearing and
[47:04] having on the breastplate of
[47:05] righteousness and your feet shod with
[47:07] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[47:09] above all taking the shield of faith
[47:11] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[47:13] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[47:14] take the helmet of salvation and the
[47:16] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[47:18] God what is the sword
[47:19] spirit the Word of God if you're not in
[47:22] the Word of God how you gonna know how
[47:23] to fight the enemy how you gonna know
[47:25] how to react when you get sick how you
[47:28] gonna know how to pray then then you're
[47:29] always expecting a miracle when God may
[47:31] say I'm going to give you healing and
[47:32] healing this difference in a miracle
[47:35] never say well if I if I go to the
[47:37] doctor I don't have faith that's a bunch
[47:38] of rubbish amen God brother BAM said
[47:41] over and over why don't you go why don't
[47:42] you go research what brother BAM said
[47:44] about doctors brother BAM said it's your
[47:46] duty if you get sick to go to the doctor
[47:48] well hallelujah well you know I've heard
[47:51] a piece of you if you go to the doctor
[47:53] you're not in the Bridewell
[47:54] hello I go to the doctor and you can't
[47:56] tell me I'm not in the bride brother BAM
[47:59] said God heals my faith God heals by
[48:01] understanding God heals by miracle God
[48:04] heals my medicine God heals my doctor
[48:06] God heals but it's all God's so see what
[48:12] the word does young people it brings a
[48:13] balance into your life when you've been
[48:15] over imbalanced by wrong teaching or
[48:17] wrong leading or something amen and it's
[48:20] put your faith in something that's not
[48:22] substantial come on God wants you to
[48:27] have faith in his words when he says
[48:31] only believe he means only believe not
[48:35] reason not trying to say well may be
[48:37] good no believe the word and let it you
[48:39] get that at work so he said take the
[48:43] helmet of salvation the helmet of
[48:45] salvation what's the helmet it goes over
[48:47] your mind and the devil's always gonna
[48:48] be shooting things in your mind you're
[48:50] not saved it didn't work a man you went
[48:51] up for prayer he was only emotional you
[48:53] only did this he's gonna be but you
[48:54] got the helmet of salvation on don't
[48:55] take it off and the sword of the Spirit
[49:02] which is the word of God praying always
[49:04] with all prayer and supplication in the
[49:06] spirit and watching thereunto with all
[49:08] perseverance and supplication for All
[49:09] Saints you got a company you got a
[49:13] company your practice with prayer now
[49:17] you're coming down to your everyday life
[49:20] you can't go to a camp meeting every day
[49:23] of your life but you can pray and
[49:24] sharpen your sword every day of your
[49:27] life
[49:28] and then when you meet the enemy along
[49:30] the course of your juni dirt due to your
[49:33] path of duty you can pull that out of
[49:35] the scabbard easy it won't stick why do
[49:38] you think Paul spent so much time you
[49:41] see because we're thinking brother Danny
[49:42] I'm hindered I got things if things
[49:44] would be different in my life I would be
[49:46] able to operate in that what why why do
[49:48] you think Paul wrote this let me just
[49:51] tell you something let me read this
[49:52] scripture what he said in Philippians he
[49:53] said I would that you'd understand
[49:55] brethren that the things what's
[49:56] happening to me and falling out rather
[49:59] unto the furtherance of the gospel the
[50:00] things that happened to me have helped
[50:02] the gospel so that my bonds in Christ
[50:06] are manifest and all the palace and all
[50:08] of the places and many of the Brethren
[50:09] in the Lord
[50:10] waxing confident by my bonds my bonds
[50:16] have helped people in their confidence
[50:18] I'm bound but the words not bound and
[50:21] they're much more bold to speak the word
[50:23] without fear now I want you to I want
[50:25] you to understand something about Paul
[50:27] Paul is in Chains and he is chained to
[50:31] the wrist to wrist of the elite Roman
[50:35] guard 24 days 24 hours a day seven days
[50:38] a week
[50:39] but he's writing to the Philippians to
[50:42] tell them how the gospel is not chained
[50:43] with him and this guard was the private
[50:47] bodyguard of the Emperor's means they
[50:49] were the elite of the elite there were
[50:52] 16,000 troops stationed in Rome in a
[50:55] fort a fortified camp they were called
[50:57] the palace guard and when Paul was
[50:59] brought to Rome he was placed in the
[51:00] care of the commander who then had
[51:02] Paul's wrists chained to the wrists of
[51:04] one of his guards one at a time day and
[51:07] night
[51:09] imagine this a different stranger is
[51:12] chained to you every day and they work
[51:15] in shifts for the whole year and the
[51:20] stranger who was probably antagonist
[51:23] antagonist ik - your way of believing a
[51:27] stranger would not necessarily speak to
[51:29] you but he would hear all you would say
[51:31] in prayer and conversation all day long
[51:36] a stranger who would be awake way while
[51:39] you slept
[51:41] next to you while you bathed there was
[51:47] no privacy for Paul Paul's guards heard
[51:52] pause thoughts when he dictated letters
[51:56] he heard all about the kingdom of God as
[51:58] Paul taught those who came to see him he
[52:01] heard all about Jesus and then he'd go
[52:03] back to the barracks and he'd talk about
[52:04] what was happening and pause witness a
[52:08] man he said he witnessed to the whole
[52:10] palace and how did he witness to the
[52:14] whole palace because of his chain not
[52:16] because of his freedom amen and because
[52:24] he was chained and then people had been
[52:26] afraid before to speak up we're free so
[52:32] sometimes your hindrances are because
[52:34] God wants to free somebody else your
[52:37] struggle is because God's going to use
[52:39] that to bless somebody others life so
[52:43] don't be ashamed of the hindrance has
[52:48] changed were used to advance the gospel
[52:51] if you ever thought of change in your
[52:53] life as a total negative something
[53:00] that's happened to sickness and maybe
[53:02] you've prayed and prayed and the devil
[53:03] come said you didn't have faith well let
[53:06] me tell you let me tell you what what
[53:12] Paul did while he was in Chains he wrote
[53:16] the book of Ephesians he wrote the book
[53:18] of Philippians he wrote the book of
[53:20] Colossians he wrote both books of
[53:23] Timothy Wow that them chains are still
[53:28] going on and on and on and on what can
[53:31] you do with your limitations I said what
[53:35] can you do with you what God can't use
[53:37] me I'm nobody I just I'm just a kid I
[53:39] Who am I sharpen your swords put on the
[53:43] armor and then stand when God's ready to
[53:45] use you here use you did you just stand
[53:48] there and I'm gonna I want to close with
[53:50] this I got four minutes left on my timer
[53:52] I
[53:53] and myself hey man I got four minutes
[53:56] left I want to leave you with this
[53:57] brother Bantam said this because people
[53:59] look at faith as a bunch of different
[54:01] ways how many's ever read Hebrews 11
[54:03] I mean God's Hall of Fame amen amen
[54:06] Abraham by faith
[54:07] Sarab amen by faith receive strength
[54:09] enoch waffle God was not a man by faith
[54:12] able by faith Amen Moses by faith Joseph
[54:15] by faith Jacob by faith by faith but you
[54:17] ever notice faith took a turn by faith
[54:22] Amen women had their dead raised to life
[54:24] by faith they subdued Keenan's by faith
[54:26] the mouth was lines of stuff by faith
[54:29] they were tortured to death not
[54:32] accepting deliverance you know it only
[54:36] somebody that's kept their sword Sartre
[54:38] and their armor on wouldn't accept
[54:41] deliverance don't you tell God how faith
[54:47] acts let God tell you how faith acts you
[54:51] just believe brother Branham said
[54:53] disempower transformation I'm closing he
[54:55] said this he said here's this girl
[54:59] sitting here in this wheelchair said and
[55:06] we have prayed for her and she knows God
[55:09] is well able to do much more than this
[55:13] take her out but she still sits there
[55:17] brother Branham said she sits there
[55:19] because he never said she sits there
[55:22] because it's a lack of faith in life as
[55:23] she just finally believed me more and
[55:26] reached that place of perfect faith she
[55:29] would get out of that chair he never
[55:30] said that he said I have prayed for her
[55:33] and she sits in that chair and she knows
[55:40] that God can do much more than that he
[55:44] said but she has such a pleasant spirit
[55:47] she's in a chain said she even inspires
[55:52] me now here's a prophet here's a prophet
[55:57] who has who talks to God sees visions
[56:00] but the life of this girl
[56:01] how much affected how much did her life
[56:04] affect a prophets faith to say she
[56:07] inspires me the way she sits in that
[56:09] wheelchair and he said she's just
[56:13] willing to take her place she didn't
[56:20] question it she just said Lord I may not
[56:25] understand this I'm in a chain called a
[56:27] wheelchair but I know you're my healer
[56:31] I'm just going to keep believing what
[56:35] group faith is greater if God had took
[56:38] her out of the wheelchair immediately
[56:40] when she asked for it she'd become a
[56:42] spoiled child wanting it as soon as she
[56:44] got it as soon as she asked why am I not
[56:46] getting it
[56:47] why am I not getting it and that's why
[56:49] if you're not careful you think that's
[56:50] the way face should be you pray that

[57:37] of George Whitfield by the band you

[57:41] him in America he was a famous English
[57:43] minister he had a profound effect on
[57:45] America and their time of their of their
[57:48] servant to England England
[57:54] that's why we have miles and not
[57:57] kilometers a man in inches and not
[58:03] metric and whoa why we threw the T back
[58:09] hey man cuz we're American anyway so he
[58:15] came over to America and he did he he
[58:18] preached a revival him and Jonathan
[58:20] Edwards up and down through the through
[58:22] America and he got he got laughed at him
[58:25] mocked because he introduced a new term
[58:26] to America called the new birth they
[58:28] didn't know because they so in in the
[58:29] different theology and everything and so
[58:31] they was given the term of the new birth
[58:33] and it caused what they called in
[58:36] America a Great Awakening and if people
[58:39] begin to awake that they didn't always
[58:41] have to pay taxes to England I didn't
[58:43] have to always bend the knee to King to
[58:45] the king and and it began a revival
[58:48] beginning the blacksmith shops and in
[58:50] the churches and and you begin to hear
[58:51] the ring Amen in the shops as they begin
[58:54] to bend the metal and and everything and
[58:56] begin to make weapons and it called an
[58:58] uprising and it's called the revolution
[59:00] revolution men rose up to a standard
[59:04] they didn't know they could and he
[59:07] traveled all around he had a traveling
[59:08] pulpit and it had buckles and everything
[59:11] and and it could collapse up to a
[59:13] certain point and they could carry it
[59:15] with them and he preached over that
[59:16] pulpit and who knows how many were one
[59:20] to the Lord over that pulping but in
[59:24] American public society a museum there's
[59:27] there's that that pulpit is on display
[59:29] and beside that pulpit is a plane back
[59:31] wooden chair nothing fancy about it this
[59:34] is plastic I know but it's something
[59:35] similar maybe just a wooden chair and
[59:37] they said in this chair said an invalid
[59:40] girl Oh
[59:42] all her life she only left that chair to
[59:46] die on the bed never healed they said
[59:50] but the way she sat in that chair had
[59:53] such a profound effect upon the people
[59:58] but they said they don't know which one
[1:00:02] won more souls to Christ
[1:00:04] I'm going to ask you how you gonna sit
[1:00:08] in your chair when you leave let's stand
[1:00:10] together there's much more could be said
[1:00:22] but I encourage you with all my strength

[1:00:31] here he's going is supposed to give an
[1:00:34] or to give an oration to the people
[1:00:37] that's going to lift them up and and you
[1:00:40] know they spend time to write down a
[1:00:42] letter of what they're going to say to
[1:00:43] the people because they're trying to
[1:00:45] encourage the people because they're
[1:00:46] facing a great battle with Germany and
[1:00:49] it looks like because of the power of
[1:00:52] Germany that American that England's
[1:00:54] going to go under and they said he got
[1:00:56] up out of his chair when he came up to
[1:00:58] address the chamber and he stood before
[1:01:01] them and he said this never give up and
[1:01:09] he stepped back and he came forward
[1:01:12] again and he said never give up step
[1:01:19] back one more time he stepped forward
[1:01:22] and he said never give up and that was
[1:01:28] his whole speech and I want to tell you
