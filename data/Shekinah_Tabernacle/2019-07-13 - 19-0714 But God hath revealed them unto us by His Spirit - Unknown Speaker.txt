you thank you god bless mr. K amen praise the Lord leave unhappy Alleluia wonderful to be a Christian I'm glad that we have this opportunity to serve God amen our lives don't finish we're here this is our time our time to rise and shine I mean so first Corinthians 2 and 9 and we're gonna read down to verse 16 but it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things you had to deep things of God well what man knoweth the things of God save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us to God which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who has known the mind of the Lord that he that that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen a let's go to 1st Peter chapter 1 1st Peter 1 we're gonna read from verse 7 down to verse 16 can you turn me down a bit thank you first Peter 1 and 7 is the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and glory and honor I mean so unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you receive with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which is unlimited signify that when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow under whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now report don't you buy them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts and your ignorance but he that which hath called you is holy for be ye holy and all manner of conversation because it was written be holy for I am holy amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you may have your seats amen so I want oh brother Barron would say and um I just get rid of the Bible says that you know I has not seen nor ear has heard or entered into the heart of me and that things which God has prepared for them that love him and many times people stay there and say well it's never it's so wonderful it's never entered into the heart of man has never man has never even thought of how great it will be but that is not the end of the scripture says but the God has revealed them unto us by his spirit so there comes a time where we're what he has in his mind for us on the other side of you know eternity or beyond the curtain of time it actually becomes reality in our in our hearts I mean so it becomes real to us it's not just an imagination or a nice idea but it becomes real because we know that when God reveals his word to us that is him showing what's in his mind I mean so and we know that God's thoughts are eternal they don't change with time so what he declares I mean in his mind or what what he has thought I mean then he transmits it down to the earth I mean that people would know I mean what he is seeing and where we're going so and I'm so wonderful yeah I'm so thankful you know that's why we have this message in this hour that brother Brown would stand and and and and we'll read a bit through crisis miss your God revealed but he basically says that the secrets are and the back parts of God's mind are now in the heart of the bride I mean so and and I trust that that will mean a lot to you I mean that we have because yo Paul you know the Apostle Paul are saying you know who has known the mind of the Lord but we have the mind of Christ so saying you know cuz man has always been trying to search what does God think what does his you know what does he like yeah you as a person what does he love you know houses you know house he revealed himself and because man's man's mind is different to God's mind amen men's ways Allah your God's ways are higher than man's ways I mean but he says now we have the mind of Christ and we understand that you know we've come to a season where we're at the top of the mountain you know as as the Apostle Paul would say you have not come to Mount Zion you haven't come to the law I mean where where no one could even touch the mouth and even if a beast would come you know you know pass some boundaries I had to be killed with a dart you have not come to that place but you've come to mount yo-yo you ever come to Mount Sinai with the law you've come to Mount Zion you've come to the habitation amen of of the bride in Christ you've come to the heavenly Jerusalem I mean and we know that that that when the Apostle Paul was speaking those things as when that was when the foundation of the Churchill's laid that faith was the foundation Christ was the chief Cornerstone I mean but we weren't just to me to stay at the foundation but we were meant to climb the mountain him until eventually that the bride grows into the stature of the fullness of Christ I mean so now we are not at the bottom of the mountain we're at the top of the mountain I mean I'm looking at some of the last stones that would be added into the building amen as as the Apostle Europe EDA would say that we are living stones lively stones built into the temple of God so we are not the beginning stones I mean that was 2,000 years ago we are the finishing stone I mean some of us even you know maybe the last stone to come into the building could be sitting here right now hallelujah so now that's the top of the top of the mountain and and we know that that when you get to the top and divine love comes down and manifests itself I mean his glory filleth all and also we are it now I'm going to tell you right now we're not looking for him to come he's here I'm in divine love is present he is divine love right so we're not looking for Christ to come and that way he's already here I mean some now we are called if that is the case then divine love should be manifesting out of our lives and everything we say do and think I mean if he has the preeminence in us that he should be the principal theme of our talking the principal theme of our actions the principal theme of what we do it should be him hallelujah I mean so he see so we have the mind so we have the mind of Christ so the bride has a different mind to the world how we think how we look at things is very different amen I trust and and I trust that the reason that we look at the world differently is not because you've become conditioned by a church or you know because your parents have said this is how you should be but actually his mind comes into you I mean so you're actually independently thinking not no you're not you're not repeating what your parents have said you're not even repeating what I have said or maybe what brother Bram said but it's God's mind himself as in you that you're not just repeating secondhand things but because you become one with him I mean that it's it's his mind and you Peleliu you I mean there's the whole purpose of you know of the gospel of redemption as God will come and dwell in a people and manifest as glory amen to restore us back to Eden once again I mean so we have the might the bride has the mind of Christ hallelujah amen and and and as as you read there in first Peter I'm just laying a bit of a foundation here with these scriptures but as he's in first Peter you know the the prophets of old by the spirit search diligently and inquired ask God when were these things be but they weren't they weren't for them they were for us hallelujah you know I'm so glad you yeah you think about it you think about church history and even through the Old Testament it was just God was laying a foundation all the hard pan hearing road was yo going in and we turn up and just enjoy the benefits of it you know it's like it's like any country that's founded there you know pioneers would go and they would they would cut the trees down build houses and settlements and roads and all the hard Yakka would be done and in the next generations they just turn up and they don't have to labor that way cause it's already built halleluyah has the same thing with us we're just receiving all the promises that means everything that was prophesied I mean we're not prophesying of a future age but we're now we're now receiving the fulfillment of all the prophecy of the scripture hallelujah isn't that right Abraham was sick Abraham was told this land is yours amen and the promised land he soaked but he sojourned there he never possessed it Amen because the promise wasn't to him it was to a seat and then and then there in Egypt that your God sent Moses to deliver them and then they went and dwelt in that land so they received what was given to Abraham and it's the same thing with us you know the New Testaments that it's all prophecy I mean speaking of today I mean we know that your emphasis means to aim it but to Relaxo to the first church age they aimed at the high calling in Christ but because the church had to go down into a dark age I mean they didn't obtain what was you know what was promised Themis like Israel when I first went into the land they didn't possess the whole land but then when David became king then they took the full borders of their land and it's the same thing today I mean we have a king hallelujah he's come to take over his kingdom and and a kingdom was full of people hallelujah that's why we are his kingdom right so when he becomes king of your life in your possess the fullness of the land every promise in Christ will be yours hallelujah I mean so he's searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which is in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow and to whom it was revealed not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are reported now which are which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sit down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore and that word wherefore means because of this so because of what we've just read I'm gonna what I want to do today I pray the Lord you know if we keep our focus on God when people lose their focus of where they're going then they begin to look around and fight one another but people see there's more land to take there's more of the word to obtain I mean there's more of the promise to have window these were to expand our borders we're going to cast out the devil we're going to take our position I mean if you have that in your heart amen you'll be focused on the Lord you'll be searching his word I mean you'll be diligently walking after him you won't care what's going on around you it doesn't matter what's happening I mean what you see at these five senses you're not following that you're following him I mean but if you keep your eyes off him then you receive those things but if your eyes are turned upon the world you'll be lost and you'll be frustrated you won't know what's going on we're not called to be frustrated about what's going on I mean we have a promise we have a promise of a body changed I mean so we've got to expand our borders I mean we can't just sit where we are everywhere to kick the devil down the devil always fights what does he fight he fights the bride's position in Christ he fights your position in Christ I mean that's why you've got to tell him to get lost I mean you got a good up your mind that makes the strength and reverent Ransa bought it hallelujah don't just let it run loose I mean there's so many voices in this day there's so many voices you're going to silence the other voices give better silence the accusers voice give it a silence that doubt your to silence the ardent voice of your humanity you had take God in His Word hallelujah we're covenant people of his word I mean you wouldn't believe it hallelujah you'll receive the promise that's why I'm preaching this today if you're wondering it's not just just something to excite your mind holy but I want you to see a man we're going to take the whole land we are not there's not another suit there's not another seven Church ages coming I mean the Ephesians aimed at relax that we intervention into a dark age I mean there's not another seven angel yo hey ages we are called to a mat but become and that's the anointing of the sage I mean it is not just a mat and say yes but become it hallelujah so this is what we call call to have right so we don't want to just sit back you got to look at where you going looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith looking into his word that's what you got to keep doing Amen see wherefore but cause of this good up which means secure bind up the loins of your mind be sober hope to the end amen hope me as an expectation oh there we go thank you how did you know what I was losing pretty late god bless you amen so hope expectation to the end for the grace that has brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now we understand that we're living in the revealing of Jesus Christ I mean with the book of Revelation is no longer just symbols it becomes reality where brother bran would say in the first seal he'd say you know that you know that's how it was in symbol form but what happens when it comes in reality form there's no longer a symbol as a mystery but it becomes a reality I mean we know that revealing it means to take the cover off I mean it means an appearing a coming a manifestation to be revealed so there has to come a time and now is where the cover the cover the this is covered but now it comes for the revealing of what's under the cover I mean it's like man was probing at the word to say this is the word they could see well it's yo and they could see by man's mind well it kind of is this you know you know who seen a statue unveiling you know you can see maybe an elbow you see a shape of it underneath you think well I think this is what it's going to be there was man through the ages probing I think it's gonna be this maybe it looks like this but then there comes a time where the veil comes off hallelujah and I'll just put it this way when Christ is walking among the seven golden candlesticks that's actually that's actually Christ and bride form he's good about the paps it says with the golden girdle actually speaks of a woman that's Christ and bride form so when the revelation of Christ comes actually Christ revealed in you hallelujah I mean that's why God is God has got to break the amnesia he's got to break the seal off our life take the cover off who we are I mean but the devil wants to try and put the cover back on no you're not the bride no you're not special no God doesn't love you wait he's trying to put the cover back on you'll never obtain the promise you'll never get victory in this you know what's that he's trying to put the cover back on you I say just just burn the cover up hallelujah this way you've got a cast down reason and cast down what the devil says about you his opinion doesn't matter God's God's Word is the only thing that matters I mean so we're now living in the time of the revealing at the revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah they're brother Branham says us in Christ and mister God revealed this is by one spirit were baptized into this body born of a spirit and we belong to a kingdom and our lives are not Americans we're not Germans we're not nothing we are Christians we are settled and walk in the spirit a love slave pardon me for the things of the world and our rights to the world we've sold out and brought this pearl of great price and walk and letting the Holy Spirit manifest itself that's what has real churches that's what you are what I am or we'll let ourselves go and serve God and by his word and not by some creatures notice the anointed man Christ Himself here our God has made no one but now look but now it is well he has preeminence --is his full control god full he manifested in Christ Jesus God's great secret of his revelation this great light of Revelation has always blinded the wisdom of this world in the days of Jesus Christ here he was when he was here on earth they had blinded them they said why you even make yourself God you make yourself equal equal with God he was not only equal with God he was God himself see they don't get it and by the way some of you might feel I've heard of infidels one time told me that Jesus never did say he was the son of God he sure did he certainly did you just don't know your Bible what did he say to the woman at the well see what did he tell her I know when Messiah cometh and when he comes he'll do these things he said I am he that speaks to you and to Paul also in different ones notice but now cry the church has the preeminence God's great secret is always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they don't just don't understand that Satan don't understand and none of the risk them understands it but just those who are predestinated to understand it how God and Christ are one they'll make him three every time see they certainly will notice Nick secondarily to manifest Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you he says look what once was God's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that as the body of Christ what was God's once great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world has now made manifest he says think of it friend he says I'm not sure I'm sure we don't get it well I can't see it the way I ought to you don't see but God's great mystery what the eternal Godhead as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ being given down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus Christ making love to the church's bride whispering secrets to her so he is saying very clearly what was once in his mind that was a secret is now and now now in the people his word is now in the people hallelujah because we have the mind of Christ hallelujah no brother Brown would would would speak this in and he he this is from the church age book but he originally says it and the spoken word as the original seed now I just want you to you know if we go slow we go slow if we go fast we go fast just just hold on okay hold on and say amen amen now from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride this is where God tells the Prophet pick up your pen and write she is a virgin to his word she is virgin because no she knows no man-made creed or Dogma by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God through made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself - made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message for the angels message was the Word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him they will have potentials for here's their head and all pals belong to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads oh lord help us I mean notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything at all his first shown him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm are not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of us the word is in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he does for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the commandment of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise hallelujah they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still now we have thus saith the Lord this messages thus saith the Lord amen so they know it that it has to be God in them doing the works who knows then fulfilling his own word he will not complete he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride because God always works through people I mean she knows that boy it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will not he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for the specific time hallelujah now and and then now he says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as they're stirred now Joshua means by Jehovah Saviour and he represents the endtime leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader caleb represents those that stay true to Joshua so he is so so God as God is having brother Browne write this down and he is telling us that the bride and Christ are one and as there was harmony between the father of son so there is harmony between the crook between Christ and his bride he gives her the Word of Life she receives that she never doubt it she knows it's her manifesting through her amen and she also knows she also knows that now there's a continuation of his ministry upon the earth that we have to finish amen God is looking at us to finish his plan of redemption you say well how can that be well he redeemed us but then there's got to be a gathering of all the names in the book amen because the Lord Jesus knows how many are going to be the around the wedding supper table amen but the thing is those names have to be redeemed hallelujah so now the finishing of you know the winding up of the plan of redemption is based on us I mean finding those last names hallelujah amen but it's interesting how he says now so that's interesting how the law causes brother Brown to write this in this order speaking of the bride being part of him and having his mind but then he goes into now let's stand like Caleb and Joshua so you know have you ever noticed how things are arranged even even the Gospels how they're arranged certain parables are spoken in certain times he goes and you know it's not a haphazard ministry that Jesus had there was an order or an arrangement in which that he that he ministered right and it's the same thing when they you know you know when God is revealing something there's is a reason that two things are connected because now we say well we have the mind of Christ I mean we're part of his wood because we as Word made flesh today as we say and we all said amen amen because that's that's what the scripture does say right but now he says now let us stand like Caleb and Joshua so so Caleb and Joshua we know that their ministry was to take caylor's I mean Joshua's ministry was to take the people into the promised land that they would play receive their position in the land I mean in Caleb we know he was the one who took his resurrection mountain I mean he stood truth all the difficult times he stood true to the word I mean so now now if this is the case God is actually laying out a pattern in front of us saying now let us stand out now I want you to notice something though when this was spa and maybe I'm jumping ahead of myself but when this was spoken this is before the seals came open so now now brother Brahim said the Pentecostal church was like in the wilderness but the the preacher sermon turning northward he says we've been going around this mountain long enough let's go into the Canaan let's go into the promised land and he received the Joshua Commission where we said now and what was the Joshua Commission Joshua's Commission was to place the people in the land and now a ministry had come at the end time right that people would cross over Jordan enter Christ not just receive blessings in the wilderness but actually enter into the promised land and take their position and the reason that brother brand received a Joshua Commission is because the word that was ministered would place us in Christ I mean because their Word of God moves us into a certain position and puts us in in the body where we should be hallelujah I mean so we understand that the book of Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians and and so he says in the first seal no no sorry he says this an adoption he says so Ephesus here sits out like Joshua positionally you notice Joshua after the crossing over the land and taking the land any divide of the land Ephraim here Meneses here this one here get here Benjamin here he divided the land and Oh notice he says this just burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains with that be positioned in the promised land now you go read in Genesis here's some homework every time that the patriarchs were born it was the mothers that actually named them so so when they added a name like Ephraim or Manasseh or Joseph that was actually prophecy going forth aiming to actually place them in their position in the land hallelujah and then when and then when Jacob is is is blessing the patriarchs amen those blessings that are written there is actually that's an expansion of that name actually declaring where they'd be in the land so for the name that they were given showed where they would be hallelujah now brother Branham comes to us and he says in the first seal now I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand so now he's calling the bride he's not saying with church anymore cuz Church has its own inheritance right there is the there is the spirit-filled and his the nominal church right and they both have an inheritance in Christ I mean once ones over Jordan ones in the wilderness hallelujah so now he's saying out now I'll call you bribe that you'll understand so he's actually he's actually speaking for the name I mean in that name gives us a certain inheritance hallelujah it gives us a certain all yo a certain thing that belongs to us now Amen hallelujah Amen it's like I call you know Christine's my wife she's part of me she you know she has certain benefits with that hallelujah but then my children are just my children it's not the same kind of relationship if that makes sense yeah it's like Church and bride two different things I mean so now so because in this hour the promised to the over cameras we will sit with him and his throne as he said as he also overcame and sat down and his Father's throne hallelujah so we know our throne is a kingdom but also if you're on the throne you know you're in charge of that kingdom hallelujah so so the over Cameron this H will be ascended to the throne as the bride does hallelujah Amen it says in first John five and three for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory in that word victory means means of success that overcometh the world even our faith I mean so our faith or our revelation of who we are and who Christ is the revelation of the word is the means of success that we overcome the world by hallelu it's not by our own human ability it's not by how smart we are it's by the revelation we receive I mean that is our means of success how do we overcome by the faith God gave us hallelujah because we know faith is a substance of things hoped for evidence of things not seen hallelujah so so when we receive revelation that that we have an eternal body waiting in the heavens I mean there is a wedding somewhere to go for there's a rapture to be had I mean what's that that's evidence that it's there for us hallelujah I'm glad that so so Ephesus here sits out like Joshua positionally now brother bran would come and the message paradox in 65 he says now I believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and as Joshua just before Ephesians raised up so did John the Baptist raised up before the next Ephesian and we're promised another Ephesians now this I hope this is made plain so that sounds like he's just speaking words up but it's actually something that's very important I believe as predicted here in the scripture therefore I think we are living in the Ephesians again we are promised what that what was left off during those seven ages so if we've come to in Ephesians now so so saying now we've come to a place where the people will take their position in Christ because that because that's one of the fusions is you got read the book of Ephesians it speaks about Christ's position and in the believers position in Christ right you're once dead in trespasses and sins walking according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience but he's quick and you made our lives made you sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so shows Christ's position the bride's position what you once were what you are now and he gives you the tools to fight Harley and says now you've got to grow into the fullness of the statue of Christ that's in Ephesians hallelujah so so I believe I'm looking at a people we're not dead anymore and sin I mean we're not darkened in our minds we're not caught up in the things of the world I mean but we've been raptured up we're being caught up in the Word of God will be made alive holy we were once dead amen brother Graham says what a resurrection that was speaking the first resurrection which is what a resurrection this is Amy for a people to come out of the tombs of the world come out of dark that I'm nationalism take yo come out of this world we once dead but now we're alive hallelujah that's a great resurrection time I mean if I want to show people evidence of the resurrection I'll show them you Polly though once dead and sending drugs in the world and whatever more but they've been made alive in Christ how they're been quick and made a life to the word because they're part of that word hallelujah so here's all you know how do you know Jesus's life can meet these people hallelujah that's why never never ever let the devil diminish your testimony amen hallelujah so Ephesians parallels Joshua it's a book of redeemed it's the placing of a people in a natural land and Joshua but then in the book of Ephesians the placing of a people in the body of Christ now brother barons figures about these two classes of people one group the Pentecostals it's like they have all the money in the bank so the anointing comes down you know they rejoice but they don't know how to cash your check to use what's in the bank and there's the fundamentalists that know who they are in Christ but they have no money it's like they can write the checks but they don't know how to you know they've got no power to use what they have he says if you just get those two together hallelujah and so it's the same thing with us I believe we've got money in the bank hallelujah amen but let's use it let's let's use the money let's cash in what do you want to buy today imagine if you know imagine if you had unlimited funds hallelujah would you what would you buy and I imagine right now there's a list going on glory and you would go buy them wouldn't you and you would enjoy it that's the same thing with the Lord hallelujah we got unlimited funds the bank of heaven no never comes back insufficient fun it always comes back yes signed sealed done hallelujah so we got a cash in cash in what we have so now now Moses we there's a paradox again we know Moses represents the law which brought them out of Egypt where in Joshua represents grace that brought them into the Promised Land so the law can never bring someone into the body of Christ it takes grace to bring them in but so now the law if you go read in the Old Testament the law places all the non bride and their inheritance because everyone has an inheritance you know it's not just the bride everyone has one right so in the law all the non bright as its given their inheritance like if you take G tirana me to we here's some more homework if you're writing it down Moses outlines he's the law he's placing he says this is where he saw you know you know this were the children of Esau dwell this is where Moab trousers where the ammonites dwell and and and we know Esau as well from Esau but Moab and the ammonites are from Lots daughters here's here's basically nominal believers that have come forth he says this is their boundaries this is where they live he says don't meddle with them don't fight them just keep journeying through don't stop and fuss of what they're doing they have their portion just keep walking on hallelujah so just keep churning on just just leave them be that's their boundaries that's where they'll be but then also it was the same for the two-and-a-half tribes that wanted to have their inheritance on the wrong side of Jordan they came to Moses they said we've got a lot of cattle we want to stay here because this land is good for cattle and then Moses was was actually yo he was he was rough with them because he actually saw that the sin of their of their fathers that were the ten spies I said they can't take the land actually that same spirit heard out jump down to generation and say no no we you know we don't want to go over Jordan we want to stay right here and now you think that is actually crazy why would someone be a believer and they say well we've received enough blessings I mean we know there's one god we've been baptized right we've got the church changes down we know how to dress we know conduct or induction you're just right we want to stay here we've got too much to take over that's crazy every every real blessing belongs over the river I mean so we don't want a cabbage down on the wrong side of Jordan we want to go over Jordan hallelujah so now you say well well I'll just I'll just drop this in right now what is crossing Jordan you have to meet the son of man yourself you have to meet the angel yourself you have to meet that mighty angel yourself have a visitation you had that and so what does that mean you got to meet God yourself not just be anointed not just your rejoice and not just got you you've got to meet him where he changes your nature changes who you are I mean that the word comes open I mean because the land that we actually in happen is the son of man is the word hallelujah where's not just this little thing and well yeah well how do you you know what are you saying it's basically when we come to a spot where we think we've found everything there's no more no there's more look over that hill look in that scripture listen to that message again say Lord open up brother BAM says the end of his ministry that the Lord would open up secret passageways in the scripture that would find him where to get it we will find the blessing I mean it's like brother I'm said every scription here if you don't see Christ in every scripture read it again has everyone ever taken up that challenge come on his his hit him here's a whole year assignment right there if he says if you don't see Christ in every scripture and that's not you trying to work us out Lord where are you and here show me where you are show me as well hallelujah it's so much more you know brother MCS is untapped resources in God untapped it's never been has never been prospected has never been looked at what's there you know like someone who's mining you know first they do a you know exploration they see what's there and they calculate well I think this is it then they work out well is it worth doing you know what's the effort you know it's so it's never been explored to see if it's even there it's all in the word doesn't mean we go off out of the message it's all in the word right but we should tap into it I want to be a miner don't you tell who you find some nuggets find find some food amen why just why just you know it's like a big massive mention if this whole room wait I mean just going to like what's your favorite supermarket it just goes into the front and get some bananas and walks out no you go into what you want you search around you oh I haven't seen that before who does that you know maybe not me so much but others do you know cuz I think I need listen listen listed and I just look for labels what it looks like and I go but you know some of us like what's here and what's this and what can I do with this what's that you're looking you're actually wanting to tap into what's in there hallelujah that just so that's like the scripture don't just don't just read the family altar pick up your bananas and walk off amen big in pep into it hallelujah why not amen why not if it's untapped resources it's a reason the resources there but we got to go find it hallelujah so now so he so yes of Moses numbers 32 he gets upset at them he says now we're for said they if we have found grace in thy sight lead us this land to be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan and Moses said unto the children of GAD into the children of Reuben shall your brethren go to war and you shall sit here and we're for discourage either heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them thus did your father's when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land so he's saying the same spirit on them has now dropped on this future did I'm a generation we don't want to be like that we went across hallelujah Amen see but but they said we'll go help them fight to all prey with them we'll sing with them we'll come to church with them amen he followed me we'll be right there we'll encourage them but no you gotta cross Jordan you were to die out saying Lord you know they cuz they wanted to bring something oh we can't bring this over Jordan if all we'll stay here I can't bring my pride over soul stay here I can't bring my own resuming my goodness what what I think I am I'm gonna you gonna you got to lay your whole life down you had a cat at all but dung doesn't matter what it is you had a counter all but dung that you can win Christ hallelujah so now brother Brahim seed yeah he sees this so there's some paradox again now there have been many men raised up and they had been for four hundred and hundreds of years they had no prophet oh they had priests and great men as we read in the history between the time of Malachi and Matthew four hundred years there had been great men but there's no prophet and then when he came on the scene to prove that he was there Ephesians made manifest John announced that Jesus was that he was the word manifested himself but how was Jesus at Ephesians it's because when John because when John introduced the Messiah the reason for that is would take the people into a true Pentecost I mean so there was a forerunner John was the forerunner he pointed out the Lamb of God and the reason he did that is to take the people to the Upper Room that receive a true Pentecost but God comes and dwells in them amen and this is exactly the same thing today God's in a prophet as we know and the purpose that he sent brother Browns ministry as he pointed out the Lamb of God the word of God amen into a true Pentecost where man and God are united amen and that's what this message does brother says it releases the holy spirit upon the people holier because when the true word is preached in power it releases the Holy Ghost of parlor people and it takes you to a true Pentecost it takes us back to a true book of Acts hallelujah and and and and that's what we've come back to we've come back to a true Pentecost hallelujah and we've come back to that true Pentecost why because there's the land to possess hallelujah there's an image to grow into hallelujah I mean it's very clear that's why God moves like he does that's why he changed us like he has why because we've been taken to a true Pentecost hallelujah glory so not just an anointing that doesn't change our owl nature changes who we are but no he comes into our souls not just onto a spread onto our souls and changes who we are hallelujah this was telling the bring your sharing up in Papua New Guinea we've come back to a true Pentecost and then what happened the translator quits for four minutes because they can hear everyone in their own language Wieck has gone back to a true Pentecost it's the word that does it it's not the person hallelujah we've gone but we've come back hallelujah we're not trying to get back to a true Pentecost we've come back and the time of Pentecost was a release it was the fifty years after the attack mean 50 days after the atonement was young 50 days after Passover was the time of Pentecost poly-r fifties are Jubilee we've come back to Liberty again hallelujah it means that John has used the Messiah took them to a true Pentecost I mean just as brother Barry introduces to the Word of God that take has taken us to a true Pentecost once again hallelujah so now so this Ephesians Christ was the Ephesians is because the people that met him now think God took them into their position in Christ hallelujah and this has been repeated this has been repeated again today hallelujah now he sees improving his word he says he says but God in the midst of all of it he raised up a prophet some son of a priest he went into the wilderness at 9 years old couldn't read his I mean he couldn't read his name even if it was the letter the size of a boxcar why did he do it he was a prophet if he had been in the education of his father he'd probably been a Pharisee or said you see one of their groups but he had an important job that was to announce the Messiah because why God kept his word and proved it a voice of one crime from the seminary no behold I've got a doctor's degree that might have been good for the old lady's birthday Almanac but not in God's Word he said the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way the Lord make his paths straight why is he preparing aware of the word then that word could be made manifest hallelujah ceases don't you see in the shadow stop here for a minute and the last days we've got to there's got to be a place repaired for the wood to be made manifest and we're living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man to saying that the new land I mean the promised land is the son of man the word himself hallelujah he says we're living by the evidence of it amen and this is what should be you know we should be living by I mean the word himself hallelujah so now so so what he's saying now he's saying that now history has repeated itself as Messiah has come again the son of man see the Ministry of brother barren is more than healing in discernment it's the son of man Jesus Christ Himself being made known to a people how this that's why you've got to look beyond you know look beyond the veil of the man I mean look beyond the veil of the man and see Christ is manifested right and when you actually see this is Jesus here again I mean what happens is now you can cross Jordan I live because we're going to understand that this age we're living in so much has happened you know we're not just continuing on like it like the church has four seven church ages I trust I'm not boring you I mean but now there's so much going on yet God the mighty angel has descended in the cell was an open book as his time shall be no more there shall be no more delay I'm gonna wind up my plans holy so if he's gonna wind up as planned he's going to get a people in their position in him hallelujah amen he sees in Ephesians 4 and 11 he says he gave some apostles and prophets some evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting which is the complete maturity of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so now this so the Apostle Paul saying this is what a grow to a man we've come out of darkness we're being quickened will be made alive hallelujah we're now sit in heavenly places where would it grow into the fullness of Christ I mean that were no longer children we're no longer tossed to and fro I mean now this is now as I said in the beginning God the bride knows what he wants done with his word I mean - what he wants done in this season the bride knows it I mean so now this is the now the bride's goal should be until we all come to the unity of faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and speaking individually this should be our goal I mean because this is now this is the Brides goal in this hour because it's the goal of our Lord Jesus Christ that a people will come to the fullness the word manifested that His divine character is in her not just a part of it but fully mature is everything he was we become right this should be our goal this should be the really the theme of our lives I mean that we should want to see each and every one of us I mean growing to the fullness of Christ hallelu that were not lying no longer spiritual children but will come mature I mean then when people see us they see Christ's character on display hallelujah this is how it yo if you don't will where there's no vision the people perish people I don't have a vision you've got to have a direction where am I going in life now I'm not talking about through jobs and careers and holidays and no it's more than that all those things are fine but what's your main goal what are you looking for in life what is your purpose of being upon this earth there should be lord I want my family to meet you Lord I want to create an atmosphere in my home where you come down I mean even if I'm on my job wherever maybe Lord I want you to be there I mean that they can you can quicken your words of their hearts I mean because when people are closed off God can't minister them but when they open up probably that's why sometimes you know tell a joke or whatever more change the atmosphere it gets people's attention well cos God wants to pierce through a mentor speak to them but I mean but we want to keep an atmosphere that you know there's no hardness of heart I mean but God can minister that's why yo you know brother I'm said if you want to see the supernatural relax amen we want to have a glorious church services relax don't be all tense and all gone god oh no say Lord Here I am minister to me change me I need changing I need a lot of changing amen mould me shape me put me on put me on your will hallelujah why because his Goldmember if he he's going to show Satan that the sick and Eve will not fall the first Eve was predestinated to fall but the second Eve cannot fall I mean so he's going to have a people because you know a great artist loves to show off their work amen that's why they have unveilings that's why they have all this big fanfare look at this we are God's masterpiece in this day hallelujah and he doesn't just want to show us off to the Angels he want to show us the enemy you couldn't stop this happening Satan you could not stop my word manifesting you could not stop a people loving me and giving their lives to me I mean that I can mold and shape them into my image you couldn't stop it look at what I've done that's why he pointed Joe Baptist to to Satan you know however many years ago have you considered my servant job holy way he's showing off this means perfect I'm so proud he's my son father he takes me at his work yeah you know at my word he may not understand all things but he's perfect there's none like him hallelujah and and a sexy the same thing with us hallelujah God has testimony meetings with his enemy hallelujah holy why could these his confidence in his salvation I mean he's not worried about what tests you may go through he has confidence in you he had confidence and joy be as confidence in you hallelujah I mean you know you know the scripture says that we're not tried with more than we can be and many times we think ma'am we can't be this but God knows we can't Alleluia amen so now so this is this should be the goal of our life because God members like taking the land Carol just says the land is ours let's go get it doesn't matter what equipment we have doesn't matter what we have let's go over it selves as it might I want to come give it to me hallelujah should be the same thing with us because remember the promise is not based on us I mean the promise is not based on you and your performance and what you think you can do no it's unconditional I mean when God came to Abraham I'll make you our mat you are a father of Nations I'm going to change your name to from Abraham to Abraham and he couldn't even have a child at the time because he's not going to make use us huh Leah and then Abraham do you see they mean I believe it I miss the same thing with us you know God says you are my bride you are my liquids one you are sinless you're virtuous you're made in my image your spotless your ass out wrinkled I mean the enemy cannot accuse you no more because I've taken care of all the evidence Holly I've watched you thoroughly clean and what do we say yes Lord I believe it I mean it when we when we respond in that way god quickens the word to our hearts amen and we actually possess what has been promised to us I mean that's why it's so important when God gives us a promise you say yes hallelujah Mary just said let it be unto me according to thy word and when she see how can these things be it's impossible never been done before in the history of man but then she just said yes I believe it hallelujah and then what she had the baby hallelujah and if that kind of faith was in her how much more you I mean how much for you or hallelujah I mean when when brother and said that Mary was just a carrier of the life but the bride is the seed again hallelujah saw that faith is in you I just say Amen let it be unto me according to thy word holiest stop saying Amen to the devil Amen people people listen to him no he say Satan my salvation is not based on you devil why do we talk to him I know I probably go down this road maybe I'm getting old on it over why do we listen to Satan and we listen to our feelings our victory is not based on our feelings hallelujah I'm feeling feel I'm gonna take a rapture today No and Enoch walked with God and was not I don't know how he was feeling it wasn't recorded because it wasn't important maybe you know it wasn't a porter hat I don't know did he have a cold did he have the flu did he have trouble at home I don't know he walked ain't man it should be the same thing with us if there's trouble in life walk with God brother and give us a quote you know there's trouble of the church walk with God trouble in the job walk with God trouble trouble in school walk with God just walk with God just keep walking with the word open there's all this going on walk with God because the devil says that this does you no good it's because it doesn't do him any good the word doesn't help Satan hallelujah cause it's not for him it's for you amen hallelujah we're gonna look at the value of what we have I mean you say well God hasn't changed me at all how do you know how do you know we look at ourselves in the mirror God changes by little by little someone comes along and says man they've changed and you just feel well I'm just the same guy oh no hallelujah amen just walk with God this trouble walk things are going on just walk with God oh yeah brother it says if the church are the new its position he says it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is this is why this should be our goal Lord show us may we know as we are known by you hallelujah may you reveal to us who we are on you hallelujah that's what we need to do amen now it says in second Corinthians three you are our epistles written in our hearts read and known of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink Lord the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart he's saying now that you the words that we are preaching is now manifested in your life holy is the word that was preached by them is now manifested in their lives so so so when I read this last hour singing why are we preaching at our children amen because we know that there's their carnal nature they need to die up they need to be born again sure but when they're young what are we what are we ministering to them by our words our deeds you know what are we preaching them because it will manifest amen help us Lord that was just maybe that was just for me amen now Ephesians 4 and 14 he says that he hints forth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to the Seif so we've got to be we're going to grow hallelujah we don't want to be tossed to and fro amen but speaking the truth and love that may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the same every part maketh increase of the body and to the edifying of itself and love this I say therefore so because of what I've just said and testifying the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk and the vanity of their mind I mean having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts so we shouldn't walk in the vanity of our mind what's your vain things thinking we're something thinking we're great you know people people they you know think their material statuses is what makes them great you know in the world but doesn't make them great oh they got a bigger house a bigger whatever that doesn't make think about it but but it's vanity look I've got this and then in a few years it's gonna be ashes anyway hallelujah you know so we shouldn't walk in the vanity of our mind vanity just means empty things has no substance the word has substance amen because we're not darkened from the Aeneid from the life of God anymore amen who being past fear who being past feeling feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him and the truth is in Jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which means the man our life the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind amen oh hey good rub there and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor but we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the Sun go down upon your wrath neither neither give place to the devil I mean let him that steal I'm stole steal no more but rather let him lay but other words that may he do the opposite of what he did and sin amen working with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth that no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers some a minister a divine influence upon their hearts and it's reflection in their life hallelujah that's how we should be amen that's what we need to be now this is we're so the son of man is the land right we have to recognize each and every one of us that Christ came in 63 with an open book the mighty angel came down to give us our inheritance right there's actually an event it wasn't sermons you know the seal series wasn't just a series of sermons that we can learn what happens the book of Revelation it was an event taking place when the word came over from 63 or 65 that was Christ himself coming to his bride and me to give her his inheritance of her inheritance in him hallelujah as an event I meant and that mighty angel is still upon the earth I mean that will be placed in our inheritance as well hallelujah you say well what does this have to do with in Ephesians we are living in that is the reason we are in Ephesians because Christ is here amen to take us to a true Pentecost that we get placed in the body of Christ where we should be amen so you say well what should I do I'm I say dig into the message there's more and there than you know more in the scripture than you know brother Brahim said when the seals came open this was a new book he's reading the same book for 30 whatever years but then when the wood came open this became knew it wasn't a different Bible as the same Bible right but because Christ himself came to his word to reveal who we are in him it became a new book hallelujah so we should say Lord let's dig in let's take our land I mean because you know when a revelation strikes the heart that's God's mind being transmitted down and that revelation releases a power in the person's life I'm they can overcome the world and overcome themselves it's like when you receive the revelation that Jesus died for you on the cross what happened is it released a power in your life to break the power of sin from you I mean because when you realize you were lost and undone you said lord save me and he revealed to you that he he took your sins did you know that doubt Calvary you you realized he was your sin that offering and you realize you didn't carry your sin no more because he carried it for you what happens it changes you what cuz the revelation releases a power in your life hallelujah and it's the same thing when God reveals you this messages Christ himself at me to take a bride in a rapture what happens that that releases a power I'm sure it released a power in your life I'm in it now you're like Lord I want to line up with your word Lord I want to love you more than anything Lord yes yeah yeah your producers of worship holy when you realize what God has done over a young you know producer worship you're so thankful Lord you're so good to us hallelujah and so why I'm saying this is keep looking in the wood because there's more revelation I mean there's more power yo you know we come to a place where the enemies now against us and with yo you know it feels like we just pushing again saying he said well how can I overcome this thing well your faith will give you the victory your revelation will give you the victory but then you look into the scripture and you find I mean God opens a story opens a character to you and it becomes a revelation then you find yourself that the things you once battled you don't battle no more why because the power of his word has been released through that revelation hallelujah so that's why I'm saying these things there's value in spending time in the scripture even if it's just you know he said well I don't have a lot of time we're just that little time use and then start from there hallelujah you know because we want to be caught up you know if you're caught up in something you rearrange your life to spend maximum might maximize your time and that thing Allu yeah and and that's what we want to do it's not about well I have to spend three hours a day and make it a law no hit be on your heart you can be walking who's ever just been driving or walking down the road or you know you're not in church you don't have your Bible open you know have the message plugged in and the scripture just comes to mind hallelujah why what's happening is because you haven't union with God she'll be having time with the Lord and you can be shopping or you can be working whatever and God starts ministering to your heart the things you've read before he he brings to your remembrance and quickens to your soul I mean what's that that's spending time with the Lord hallelujah but the pens and our frame of mind of where our thoughts are caught up sure we've got to think about what you know I trust we think about driving when we're driving you know you know we have to give some you know thought part of what we're doing in life sure so it doesn't mean you used to become a monk and you never think about what you're doing and where you're going but you know but it depends about your frame of mind Allu you know I thought I'm just gonna leave it there but look into it there's more on this word than then we even know there's more to the Lord Jesus than what we fare them are but we've heard it all no we haven't heard it all oh I understand it all you maybe understand it but it's not down here you hallelujah let's take all the land let's take every divine promise I mean let's
