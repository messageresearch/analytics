[28:53] um so we all dressed up and we all come
[28:56] to church tonight all ready to
[28:59] to do some
[29:02] some fellowship with our lawn so please
[29:04] don't get distracted try and try not to
[29:06] fade away you know just it's hot
[29:08] sometimes it's it's people get tired you
[29:12] know but tonight go get your blessing
[29:14] amen because there's definitely one for
[29:16] you there
[29:18] um let's let's open our first thing I've
[29:20] got a little side note this is a thought
[29:22] that came today now hear this out this
[29:24] is about other mine thought forgive me
[29:28] so if they say that when you're having
[29:30] fun time flies and it really does fly
[29:33] who knows
[29:34] to all your kids when when we having fun
[29:37] how fast does the time go
[29:39] you're just about to have fun and then
[29:42] Mom and Dad goes we need to go and
[29:44] you're like oh but I had so much fun and
[29:47] then you go how did two hours or three
[29:48] hours before just go gone
[29:50] well now let me tell you this is a
[29:53] thought you have to take
[29:54] so if Heaven has eternity
[29:57] how much fun aren't you going to have
[29:59] there when there's no stop to it think
[30:02] about that God had to make a place where
[30:05] there is no time because we're going to
[30:06] have so much fun
[30:09] nobody's gonna stop it just think about
[30:11] it you know there's a stop to a fun year
[30:14] but in heaven it's just going to be all
[30:16] different I think sometimes we we're so
[30:19] stuck in this round that we forgot that
[30:21] there's a better world coming there is
[30:23] no sin no cell phones no emails no
[30:25] nothing that's going to chase us you
[30:27] know no no bad guys no no things that
[30:30] can upset you no sickness no Sorrows no
[30:32] no breaking your toe Joshua no cutting
[30:35] your leg Jonathan you know you'll be
[30:37] just good every day you won't fall
[30:40] asleep when when the angels are singing
[30:42] you'll just be awake and ready amen hey
[30:45] man I think that's good that's something
[30:47] worth looking forward to especially not
[30:48] having a phone praise the Lord
[30:51] so
[30:52] um I don't want to do a I always say
[30:54] this but I don't want to have a serious
[30:56] sermon but I want you to to put yourself
[30:59] in the shoes of David tonight just for a
[31:02] brief time so so if you can take
[31:05] yourself and put you in the place where
[31:06] David finds himself tonight
[31:08] and then see how God works around David
[31:11] to get him in that position try to see
[31:13] that and make it personal don't leave it
[31:16] by David make it personal because I can
[31:19] tell you that this pleased me so much
[31:20] because I came in the same space we we a
[31:23] couple of things or multiple things
[31:25] happen and I was standing in a spot
[31:27] where I said Lord what am I doing here
[31:30] what what am I doing here I need you to
[31:33] step in now so so I encourage you don't
[31:35] think anything else don't think
[31:37] preaching and boringness and Bible and
[31:39] all these scriptures put yourself
[31:41] tonight in the shoes of David amen and
[31:44] may the word bless the reading oh Lord
[31:46] brace the reading of his word tonight
[31:48] we're going to go to First Samuel
[31:50] chapter 30.
[31:54] so I'm going to kind of Hit the the back
[31:56] part of the story and then we're going
[31:58] to go a little bit back and see if we
[31:59] can fill in the rest because then
[32:02] um hopefully and if I leave my notes
[32:03] tonight who cares okay so then I was
[32:06] meant to do it if I do say anything that
[32:09] you don't understand please forgive me
[32:11] I'll speak English and self-defense and
[32:13] uh anything I do say I say out of love
[32:16] I'll never mean anything harsh about it
[32:17] because I really love all of you like
[32:19] you're my brothers and sisters okay amen
[32:22] so let's go to two verse number one it
[32:26] says and it came to pass when David and
[32:28] his men will come to zieglag on the
[32:31] third day that their amalekites have
[32:33] invaded the south of Ziegler and Smith
[32:35] and Ziegler and burned burned it with
[32:38] fire
[32:40] and had taken a woman captive they were
[32:43] therein they slew not any the great uh
[32:46] great nor small but carried them away
[32:48] and went on their way so David and his
[32:51] men came to the city and behold it was
[32:54] burned with fire and their wives and
[32:57] their sons and their daughters were
[32:58] taken captives and David and the people
[33:01] that we were left were with him lifted
[33:03] up their voice and wept until they had
[33:05] no more power to weep amen may the Lord
[33:09] add his Blessing to this word you may
[33:11] have your seats so it it sounds like
[33:13] this is now a real sober moment and I'm
[33:16] gonna it's gonna be a tough one but nah
[33:18] just just hang in there it's actually
[33:20] there's a good good into this
[33:22] the Lord don't put us in the place and
[33:25] don't make a way out if you want to want
[33:28] to find a scripture for it I got it let
[33:29] me tell you
[33:30] here we go listen to this one in First
[33:34] Corinthians and the 10th chapter 12
[33:36] verses is therefore let him that think
[33:38] of he stand take heed least he falls
[33:41] there I have no temptation taking you
[33:43] but such as Comet to man but God is
[33:45] faithful who is who is willing that you
[33:49] not suffer or be tempted above what you
[33:52] are able to withstand but every
[33:55] Temptation also is a way of Escape that
[33:58] he may be able to bear it
[34:00] so remember you sometimes find yourself
[34:03] and this is where I'm kind of just going
[34:05] to leave my note to find yourself in a
[34:07] in it I call it the the ziglag moment
[34:10] you know because I always want to
[34:11] identify somewhere in scripture we where
[34:13] God could have gotten my attention so I
[34:16] can I can encourage you young people
[34:17] before you know all
[34:19] um try to go somewhere else stay here
[34:23] but if you read your Bible
[34:26] hear me out if you read your Bible there
[34:30] will be things that pop out there that
[34:33] God would place in your heart and then
[34:35] when you come and sit here it will be
[34:38] things come over the pulpit that will
[34:39] take that little thought that God put in
[34:41] your heart and just go
[34:43] but the moment you get distracted the
[34:46] moment you start thinking of basketball
[34:48] and 100 meter finals and uh football
[34:53] called it football this time or TV games
[34:56] or javelin throw what happens is God
[34:59] wants to bless you and show you that
[35:01] he's real but once you start wandering a
[35:04] little bit oh that's just that they were
[35:06] distracting you don't fall for his
[35:08] tricks try to stay in it it's a fight
[35:11] amen
[35:13] so my sermon title tonight is losing
[35:16] touch with reality
[35:18] now how does that go into the Ziegler
[35:20] moment where we David came and all of a
[35:23] sudden he finds himself looking at a
[35:25] city burned to the ground
[35:27] while it's pretty much easy if we go a
[35:29] little bit back and we go now
[35:31] to um one Samuel 27
[35:36] and I'll just read it for Saving Time
[35:37] uses and David said in his heart I shall
[35:40] now perish One Day by the hand of Saul
[35:43] there is nothing better for me to do
[35:45] that I should speedly escape to the land
[35:47] of the Philistines and shorten and soul
[35:50] shall despair of me to seek me any more
[35:53] in the coast of Israel so shall I escape
[35:55] out of his hand now for me is when I
[35:59] look at David David used to pray just
[36:01] before this happened he used to pray and
[36:03] ask God for everything shall I go shall
[36:05] I go shall we do this he had such a
[36:08] relationship with God and God was busy
[36:09] training David because before this very
[36:12] moment before Saul even took a evil
[36:15] spirit
[36:16] before he got there David was was led by
[36:19] God every step of the way so he was
[36:21] chosen by God he was told what is his
[36:23] identity you're going to be King David
[36:25] knew this and then all of a sudden he
[36:27] sends him a bear he sends him a lion he
[36:29] sends all these trials on his face sends
[36:31] him Goliath and things just start
[36:32] falling into place
[36:34] but now he finds he's in a very cushy
[36:37] seat in the king's Palace and he's
[36:39] fighting the king's battles and he's
[36:40] winning the king's battles and all of a
[36:42] sudden the women come back and they sing
[36:44] David uh saw us as slain His Thousand
[36:48] Davidson ten thousand and Saul look at
[36:51] this and he goes hey oh my so what's the
[36:57] next thing to give him the kingdom
[36:58] because all the people has already got
[37:00] favor and they like David and he gets a
[37:03] complex
[37:04] and now that he has a complex he gets
[37:07] fear because he doesn't want to lose the
[37:09] kingdom and now he opens himself up
[37:12] to a evil spirit
[37:14] and it says if you go to Samuel 18 it
[37:17] says an evil spirit from God went on
[37:20] soul
[37:21] so this doesn't mean God is the evil
[37:24] spirit this means that all Spirits are
[37:27] subject to God so now here it is all
[37:30] spirits
[37:31] are subjected to God he owns it all he
[37:35] owns the devil with job he said hey have
[37:38] you considered my servant job he used
[37:40] that Spirit to drive a testimony to say
[37:43] that job was faithful
[37:46] you know and he was going to continue in
[37:48] the no matter what happens he will not
[37:50] curse God so he used that evil spirit to
[37:53] get job to say testify of me that I am
[37:56] God and you are a Overcomer and he had
[37:59] tough times and it was real bad now
[38:00] think about job and I'm kind of jumping
[38:02] off you but you get home and at one two
[38:05] of it comes and goes you just lost all
[38:07] your your stock that's just all burn
[38:09] okay gone then they they came over and
[38:12] then they killed all your sons and
[38:13] daughters if that's not worse they
[38:15] burned your bonds and all those things
[38:16] you kind of well I think it was burned
[38:18] your bon secunda remember there's four
[38:19] guys that came to him but this all four
[38:22] events happened like in as the one was
[38:25] finishing his sentence the next one
[38:27] shows up and so I got more bad news and
[38:29] now job sits in this situation now look
[38:32] at that and he's thinking something's
[38:34] going on here
[38:36] but he got God God giveth God take of
[38:39] away blessed be the name of the Lord so
[38:40] he goes back to his training he goes
[38:42] back to his experience with God but
[38:44] David here now he comes to Ziegler
[38:48] so before he got to zeklag if you go to
[38:50] 17 or 28 and this is where it's actually
[38:52] where I want to talk about it says
[38:55] um
[38:56] no that's 27. he went he went now to the
[38:59] Philistines so he went to akish and he
[39:01] got to akish and he says King akish I
[39:04] pledge allegiance
[39:06] I'm gonna fight your battles
[39:08] but aches is
[39:11] so he got hurt in church
[39:14] Israel
[39:16] and something scratched him and all of a
[39:18] sudden he finds himself in a place where
[39:20] he's fighting for the enemy
[39:22] because he lost who he was he lost his
[39:25] identity God said you're king of Israel
[39:28] not Philistine God says I'm going to put
[39:31] all your enemies in front of me you're
[39:32] gonna destroy them all he's going to do
[39:34] it he said I will make you King and
[39:36] that's why when Saul was was persecuting
[39:39] David and he was kept on persecuting him
[39:41] David said even whenever Abisha was next
[39:44] to him and say just put the spear
[39:45] through him he said nah it's God's
[39:48] anointed one I will not kill him because
[39:50] it's not me that removes the king it's
[39:52] God that removes the king but see just a
[39:54] couple of chapters before this he knew
[39:56] who he was
[39:57] but then he got to such a place after
[40:00] after Jonathan and Hima split up and you
[40:03] could see their friendship they had a
[40:04] real deep friendship and he had
[40:05] heartache and he had now I don't
[40:08] understand why Saul wants to kill me
[40:09] I've lost my best friend whom I love so
[40:12] much and now I'm here with men that's
[40:14] all rejected from Israel basically came
[40:16] around me and and all they want to do is
[40:19] kill me so I'm going to take all these
[40:21] guys and I'm gonna go bat for the other
[40:23] team I'm gonna fight against Israel
[40:26] but what place is he now in
[40:29] now this is what I want to say is are we
[40:31] forgetting what God put in our heart we
[40:33] God put us and what the promise he put
[40:35] over you he says you're going to take a
[40:37] Rapture he said we'll have Great
[40:39] Fellowship together he says your brother
[40:41] is there for your Affliction for a
[40:43] season you know he says iron sharpens
[40:45] iron you know there's a reason we all
[40:47] gel so nicely together because we were
[40:50] designed to rub we were designed to get
[40:53] close and get get in each other's
[40:55] Comfort zones
[40:56] because if you get out of your comfort
[40:58] zone then God can start moving you but
[41:01] now David just goes to a a a
[41:04] Lucas his self-preservation and he says
[41:07] well I know that there's one guy that
[41:10] that fights against Saul and that would
[41:12] back me in this fight okay and I'm gonna
[41:14] go and support him
[41:16] now in the church not our church I don't
[41:19] know any politics and churches but in
[41:21] the church I've seen people turn against
[41:23] each other and take different opinions
[41:26] and form it to their little bit of
[41:28] opinion so that they can have a
[41:30] reasoning or a justification to what
[41:32] they do don't do that
[41:35] don't do that because what you're going
[41:37] to find is God will slowly let you in
[41:39] that in that permissive will because I
[41:42] believe as a Christian and this is not
[41:43] this is not brother bran versus me
[41:45] believing it is if you're on God's
[41:47] permissive will and you do something
[41:48] wrong God will still come and step in
[41:51] and guide you all the way back because
[41:52] you are predestinated for a certain
[41:54] outcome but the way he does it is not
[41:58] always nice
[41:59] it's not always nice so when you look at
[42:03] other Spirits you know like sickness why
[42:04] did I get sick after camp we go to Camp
[42:07] we're having a wonderful Jubilee and all
[42:09] of a sudden half of everyone there is
[42:11] sick and you go God but what have we
[42:13] done wrong no
[42:15] see that's the wrong attitude Armand
[42:17] it's not what have you done right what a
[42:20] wrong what have you done right
[42:22] you know and now you seek where you're
[42:24] going to go to now you just come from
[42:26] Camp I'm putting a half a trial on you
[42:28] and all of a sudden oh
[42:30] why don't you go Lord you know what
[42:32] thank you thank you you know yes I feel
[42:35] bad but you know what that doesn't
[42:37] matter but see what happened is we
[42:39] quickly forget just after a jubilee we
[42:41] walk out of them quickly we're back here
[42:43] and then we forget who we are and what
[42:46] what God said we are the bride the one
[42:48] that will overcome I wish I could
[42:51] explain to you overcoming
[42:54] overcoming for me is
[42:56] annihilating anything that's in front of
[43:00] you that's gonna get between you and
[43:02] your end goal overcoming is not trying
[43:04] to tiptoe Plus past a sleeping dragon
[43:09] or a lion there and going
[43:14] and then Reuben of course he goes steps
[43:16] on the biggest tweak and you're like oh
[43:18] and then you get to the other side and
[43:19] you're like I overcame nah overcome I
[43:22] say sit down done that's where you
[43:25] belong you you're not scared you're not
[43:27] intimidated you just you know you are
[43:29] you know where you're going that's an
[43:31] overcomer so that's not somebody that
[43:33] when sickness comes or when the evil
[43:35] spirit comes upon you you ask why
[43:38] we don't ask why we say Lord your will
[43:41] be done I still walk on
[43:43] okay the Overcomer there's no reasoning
[43:46] in here that you want to punish me God
[43:48] but when he does put it on you you just
[43:50] go where do you want me Lord
[43:52] yo your mindset change when you do that
[43:54] you where do you want me what do you
[43:56] want me to do do you want me to just sit
[43:58] down for a couple of days and be sick
[44:00] hey well then I sit down I'd be sick you
[44:01] know if I can't stand up I'm fine I'll
[44:03] be here but you know what something in
[44:06] me said I can't stand it
[44:07] I'm gonna go and do it anyways and
[44:10] you're limping and you're doing your
[44:12] thing and you go praise the Lord but
[44:13] you're going on we don't just die
[44:17] brother Isaac I look at you you your
[44:19] Priestess sermon your Gods so if you're
[44:22] a God
[44:23] if you're a God and the the almighty
[44:27] Creator The Sovereign God dwells within
[44:29] you just pause for a fake listen to this
[44:32] the almighty God created heavens and
[44:35] earth takes the time to come and dwell
[44:37] within you and then he says it will be
[44:41] so who can stop you
[44:43] who can stop you because it's not you
[44:46] speaking you just say Lord I'm not I'm
[44:48] not able but I'm available
[44:50] okay so now here David comes and he
[44:53] forgets who he is and he gets there and
[44:55] he goes to the king of akish and before
[44:57] that he Plays the Fool in front of him
[44:59] the Nile he is
[45:00] they're not completely used to survive
[45:03] okay then he goes back to that same King
[45:06] and he goes begs for a place to stay
[45:09] think about it and then he goes well
[45:12] King I will prove myself I will fight
[45:14] against the amalekites I will fight
[45:15] against all the borders I will claim
[45:17] your land I will make your name great he
[45:20] didn't say it in so many words but he
[45:21] was doing it because when he came with a
[45:23] report to the king of aches he said I've
[45:26] done all this I've made a way everywhere
[45:27] we just listened to it in the car I made
[45:29] a way for you
[45:31] then here comes the test
[45:34] because God now goes and he looks at
[45:35] David and he goes David you're not in
[45:37] your position
[45:39] and actually the things are not really
[45:40] going according to plan and you're
[45:42] backbiting and you're fighting and
[45:44] you're against people that I love and
[45:45] what are you doing there
[45:47] now make this personal
[45:50] you know Sticky Fingers
[45:52] you are not where I want you
[45:54] you know because sometimes we want to go
[45:56] for a job we go Lord can I have that job
[45:58] yesterday
[45:59] Lord if it's not going to be my job hey
[46:01] just just let it don't let it happen but
[46:04] you put it in
[46:05] but if you're really sincere you'll stop
[46:07] and say Lord I need an answer before I
[46:09] go ahead I need your answer shall I go
[46:13] shall I Stay
[46:14] shall I sign shall I not
[46:17] take your Bible open it up have a prayer
[46:20] meeting ever one and one with God when
[46:22] there's big decisions in your life
[46:23] should I go play that game on a Sunday
[46:25] or do you want me in church
[46:29] you know should I write this text
[46:31] message out of anger or should I pause
[46:33] and just think about it
[46:35] the only these times in your life where
[46:37] you you really want to do something and
[46:39] it's all boiling up inside but you
[46:42] forget to really ask the will of God
[46:43] because what we do is we we kind of make
[46:46] God do what we want him to do through us
[46:49] for other people which is not his will
[46:50] and and it's just a mess and then what
[46:53] happens is you you all start hurting
[46:55] people and you burn studies down and you
[46:57] burn relationships down and you hurt
[47:00] people's feelings but you don't want to
[47:02] do it because but I asked God but have
[47:05] you really stopped because I believe if
[47:07] David stopped here before he went to the
[47:09] the king of of of or akish
[47:12] before he really went there and he said
[47:14] okay alone
[47:15] every other battle I fought that I
[47:17] fought for you I said
[47:19] bring that your own Thunder
[47:22] bring the linen ephod let me pray
[47:25] I need your answer here Lord Saul's
[47:28] trying to kill me you know what Saul
[47:29] could not kill him even if he threw ten
[47:32] javelins that is
[47:34] it says Saul had it now if you know Men
[47:37] of War in the old days they didn't miss
[47:40] targets now if you really think about it
[47:43] they didn't miss talking their job was
[47:44] to kill people and to win because the
[47:47] thing is it was his life or your life
[47:49] so when Saul had his Javelin sitting at
[47:52] the table in his hand and David was
[47:54] about a couple of meters away from him
[47:55] how could he miss
[47:57] Ed twice
[47:59] and then he threw the same Javelin at
[48:01] his son and he couldn't even hit him
[48:04] but the thing is God will not let
[48:06] anything happen to you David just keep
[48:09] walking just keep trusting but David
[48:11] lost confidence in what God can do for
[48:14] him and that's when he started looking
[48:15] towards the Philistines
[48:18] don't lose confidence and I say it in a
[48:20] nice way don't lose confidence in this
[48:22] word and start looking at the world
[48:26] because there's only one true thing on
[48:28] this Earth
[48:29] and that's the word of God everything
[48:32] else I can tell you is fake
[48:36] fake
[48:37] they can make it look real they can make
[48:39] it look good it is fake it's engineered
[48:43] to distract you you little eaglets and
[48:45] the big eaglets and all the other
[48:47] eaglets okay
[48:49] think about it
[48:50] there is nothing I used to watch I used
[48:53] to watch wrestling oh boy I'll say it
[48:56] yes man and my favorite favorite
[48:58] character was was there was two it was
[49:00] rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin and one
[49:02] day these two guys made up and you know
[49:04] what happened Stone Cold Steve Austin
[49:07] was running towards the Rock and before
[49:09] he was even halfway to him the rock or
[49:13] rainy wind
[49:16] and Steve Austin still went and
[49:18] completed the move and fell over him and
[49:19] that's the day where I knew it was fake
[49:21] it was all scripted but before then I
[49:24] thought this is it man this is wrestling
[49:26] hey you know I loved wrestling but it's
[49:29] all that's how the world is but you
[49:30] can't see the fakeness if you're so
[49:33] entrapped with it all you'll see is what
[49:35] it is
[49:37] but when I took a step back and I went
[49:39] whoa let's rewind this one and I saw it
[49:42] again and I thought man this is fake and
[49:44] that's the last time I watched fatty
[49:46] because I really thought it was real I
[49:48] promise you I'm not lying I thought it
[49:49] was real
[49:50] but when I saw the fakeness of it and I
[49:52] was young to be my defense you know I
[49:54] was about nine years old I was like
[49:56] Liam's age and I really thought it was
[49:58] real and it shocked me that they would
[50:00] they would be fake you know and I
[50:02] stopped watching it now I hope you see
[50:04] that the world is fake and you stop
[50:06] watching it
[50:07] amen
[50:08] I encourage you the world's fake stop
[50:11] watching it distract you second is
[50:13] distract you it's going to get you to a
[50:14] ziglag moment
[50:15] because you know what I'm gonna I'm
[50:18] gonna do that now here we go
[50:21] here we go let's go all turn your Bibles
[50:24] brother Ed if you can put this one up I
[50:26] just want to find it I kind of
[50:28] go to
[50:30] is definitely number two here
[50:33] Proverbs 3
[50:38] and we're gonna go the
[50:40] one to twelve
[50:42] so remember we're still with ziglag I'm
[50:44] about to close guys so just hang in
[50:45] there I don't want to make it too loud
[50:47] but we're still with z-glax so remember
[50:48] David is still sitting in a very tight
[50:51] spot because the king of akish is going
[50:53] to ask him to go fight
[50:55] against these people proverbs 3.
[50:58] Davey uh proverbs 3. and we're going to
[51:02] go verse one so so so remember the king
[51:05] of akish after this is actually or the
[51:07] king
[51:08] whoever he was one of the Philistine
[51:10] Kings he's going to ask David to go
[51:12] fight for him now against his own people
[51:14] now see what mind space David is is in
[51:18] at the moment he's so confused that he
[51:21] would fight his own people
[51:24] and he would willingly do it and even
[51:26] prove because it says there when he said
[51:28] that to him he says and I will even he
[51:30] says now oh that's the other one he says
[51:34] um
[51:37] uh chapter 286 and it came to pause
[51:40] though I have to tell you this in those
[51:41] days that the Philistines gathered the
[51:43] armies together for Warfare to fight
[51:45] with Israel and ake said unto David no
[51:48] thou assurity that thou shall go with me
[51:51] to the battle
[51:53] and thy men and David said to Achy
[51:55] surely thou shall know what thy servant
[51:58] can do
[52:00] now is a man of war and he sees to
[52:03] achies bro I'm going to destroy them
[52:07] I'm gonna I'm gonna destroy them
[52:09] so all these guys are so against them
[52:11] issues that says I want to destroy it I
[52:13] want to I just want to tell them
[52:14] something don't let God get on your case
[52:17] because what David had to go through was
[52:19] not nice to get him back on track to
[52:22] make him a king
[52:23] and if you're predestinated you will
[52:25] come regardless of what you think or
[52:27] where you are you will come
[52:29] God don't play games he does not play
[52:32] games so let's go to if you can put that
[52:34] up brother Ed please
[52:36] um
[52:37] Proverbs 3
[52:38] and verse 1 and I've got a deal on my
[52:40] phone just so I don't miss it
[52:44] if I can foreign
[52:46] and this is this is Solomon now talking
[52:49] so now I say how all these things just
[52:51] died together he says my son forget not
[52:54] thy law
[52:55] but let thine heart keep my Commandments
[52:57] for length of days and for long life and
[53:00] for peace shall they add to thee so it
[53:03] says hey if you just stick with reading
[53:04] your word you pray and you just keep the
[53:07] Lord's commandments you'll have peace
[53:10] here you won't have battles you wanna
[53:12] you get tested but peace is not the fact
[53:15] that you're in a battle peace is how you
[53:17] feel in the battle
[53:19] okay so when you're in a trial and you
[53:22] are and it's a heavy fiery trial and
[53:24] your heart's all over the show and your
[53:25] emotions are up and down you're not
[53:27] having peace but if you're in a trial
[53:29] and you know that God has the trial you
[53:31] got peace you actually have peace and
[53:34] you know that whatever is going to
[53:35] happen in this trial God has control
[53:38] okay he says so shall you find favor and
[53:41] good understanding in the sight of God
[53:44] oh let not mercy and true forsake thee
[53:46] bind them about the neck right
[53:50] um write them upon the table of thine
[53:51] heart so shall thy find favor and good
[53:54] understanding in the sight of God and
[53:56] Men trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[53:59] and lean not to thine own understanding
[54:02] so David was leaning unto his own
[54:05] understanding okay he was going his way
[54:07] he didn't ask God he didn't consult God
[54:10] I'm pretty sure he just kind of had made
[54:13] a I just don't like that guy type of
[54:15] thing you know in all the ways
[54:17] acknowledge Him in all the way he did
[54:20] come on he look he looked at Saul like
[54:23] and he says sore men I could have killed
[54:25] you twice
[54:26] okay and then you make peace and then
[54:28] you still want to kill me like I'm over
[54:31] this brother like seriously every time I
[54:33] tell him God bless you he just shakes
[54:35] his hand away you know every time I want
[54:37] to want to give him a hug he wants to
[54:39] give me a bump you know and and it's
[54:41] it's just it's it's that attitude where
[54:43] you get to a point where you're tired
[54:44] but then you act out of the flesh you
[54:47] act out of your own understanding
[54:48] because you think if I apply it this way
[54:50] he'll get it
[54:51] it's not the way
[54:53] you have to go back to God you have to
[54:55] say Lord how can you help me get through
[54:58] this trial and help him get through the
[55:00] stroll that's the right attitude but we
[55:01] go on Amen
[55:03] I enjoyed that brother Ben
[55:05] in all the ways acknowledge Him and He
[55:09] Shall direct your paths in all thy ways
[55:12] acknowledge Him God should I do this
[55:15] God what if I don't do this God should I
[55:18] go wash the car the rain clouds us out
[55:20] no you're wasting your time but I'll
[55:21] just go and do some fellowship you know
[55:23] like consult him in everything you do
[55:24] you cannot go wrong you cannot go wrong
[55:27] man should I take this job should I
[55:29] quote this job is it actually worth it
[55:32] Lord what would you do this is your
[55:34] business this is your life this is
[55:35] everything for you what would you want
[55:37] me do and wait
[55:38] don't go on with it wait wait till it
[55:41] tells you clear in the scriptures in the
[55:43] word yes son go
[55:45] that's that's how I would do it don't
[55:47] don't fill in anything and sign for
[55:49] anything until you hurt and you know God
[55:51] is with you because it's going to cause
[55:53] you grief
[55:54] he says some
[55:56] be not wise to their own understand to
[55:58] your own eyes fear the lord and depart
[56:01] from evil
[56:02] so basically stop watching YouTube and
[56:05] Twitter and all that nonsense get off
[56:08] those stuff there's no good that can
[56:10] come from it the only thing you should
[56:12] watch on YouTube is a sermon by Brother
[56:14] bean and all those Awesome Brothers out
[56:16] there you know if you're gonna do
[56:18] something if you're gonna use the
[56:19] internet use it for God
[56:21] okay if you need
[56:24] to find out how to make a table Brother
[56:26] Andy and all those things than it is for
[56:28] your business it's all fine but be
[56:30] careful because it quickly goes like
[56:32] this and before you see it you're not
[56:34] even at a table anymore you're flying to
[56:35] Hong Kong and seeing all the exotic
[56:37] animals you never knew before what am I
[56:39] doing you're not gone man I was looking
[56:41] at a table
[56:42] how does reason get to Hong Kong I don't
[56:46] know but it went that way okay
[56:48] everything goes to China so you go I go
[56:51] to China quite often
[56:53] oh praise the Lord hey man I do and I do
[56:58] I got Expressway there all right I
[57:00] definitely but I kinda I do it in a
[57:02] loving way so I go and trade for all of
[57:04] you as well
[57:05] bring some cool cheap gifts back
[57:09] um
[57:10] you see so
[57:11] um but late note that our own eyes via
[57:14] the uh what be not wise in our own eyes
[57:17] fear the lord and depart from Evil it
[57:19] shall be Health to thy navel and Marrow
[57:21] to thy bones honor the Lord with thy
[57:25] substance
[57:26] and with the first fruits of thy
[57:29] increase
[57:30] don't forget him when it's going good
[57:33] I don't forgive him when he's going good
[57:35] because you're going to need it when
[57:37] it's going bad so don't forget him when
[57:40] it's going good
[57:41] [Music]
[57:42] um my son despise not the chastising of
[57:45] the Lord neither be wary of his
[57:47] correction
[57:49] because he's gonna give you a
[57:50] makulupak's law if you're not in your
[57:53] place
[57:54] and it must hurt it must hurt it must
[57:58] give you a place where you can stop and
[58:00] realize that the almighty God is trying
[58:02] to get you attention to get you back on
[58:05] track
[58:06] because God would not have to give you
[58:08] correction if you're walking in his way
[58:11] he doesn't have to because you're in the
[58:13] way so when things start happening
[58:15] strange things and and a lot of things
[58:18] around you stop
[58:20] think pray get on your knees seek the
[58:23] scriptures say Lord what is going on
[58:25] here why why is my son doing this or why
[58:28] is my daughter doing this or why is my
[58:29] husband acting out or the boss all of a
[58:32] sudden had a situation man I never got
[58:34] in trouble at work no sense or I've got
[58:36] in trouble with plenty of times but but
[58:38] since I took a fleet manager role I used
[58:41] to always just you know nothing nothing
[58:43] it's all just cruisy we look after stuff
[58:46] the break we fix it we go on I never had
[58:49] a conflict or a or a real discussion
[58:52] with my boss was actually angry with me
[58:53] I hope he's not watching this but hey
[58:55] you know and all of a sudden one day I
[58:58] get to work and everything is wrong the
[59:01] workshops is wrong and I'm just hearing
[59:03] a little bit of a testimony he's angry
[59:05] at me the one of the workers is angry
[59:07] everything and I seriously have not done
[59:10] anything so maybe I should have done
[59:11] something I don't know but I haven't
[59:13] done anything
[59:14] and I stop halfway through the then
[59:16] again now Lord
[59:18] I said no no no no no something
[59:20] something's going on
[59:21] you want to move me here uh you got my
[59:24] attention but never have I come here and
[59:26] I got so much resistance
[59:29] never I was comfortable and then he goes
[59:32] no I don't want you to be comfortable I
[59:34] want to move you so I go back in the
[59:36] woods and I start going and I get into
[59:37] this book of David and Samuel by read
[59:40] David
[59:41] and I can identify exactly where I am
[59:44] find yourself in the scripture and I
[59:46] read God I you want my attention you got
[59:49] it what do you want me to do and all of
[59:51] a sudden he's starting to move things
[59:53] around me and I'm still not completely
[59:55] sure where he wants me to go but I know
[59:57] he's now doing the work so I'm waiting
[1:00:00] hands off saying Lord show me what to do
[1:00:03] but he got my attention because it was
[1:00:05] so rough that I knew that this is not
[1:00:07] normal this is not normal I walked into
[1:00:10] a Ziegler moment things were burning
[1:00:12] down man and I was like this is not
[1:00:14] normal so God wants your attention then
[1:00:16] you have to stop and get let him get
[1:00:18] your attention he says
[1:00:21] um so then in verse 10 so shall thy
[1:00:23] Barnes be filled with plenty and the
[1:00:25] priests show both a burst out with new
[1:00:28] wine so now we go back to David
[1:00:32] so and then I'm going to close with this
[1:00:33] because I'll leave my nose now because I
[1:00:34] know where I want to go thank you Lord
[1:00:38] so you find yourself in a place where
[1:00:41] you haven't heard from God for a while
[1:00:45] I don't know if anybody of you were
[1:00:46] there before but I was there
[1:00:48] like a Saul asks you know should we
[1:00:52] fight against the Philistine so what's
[1:00:53] going to happen and he gets no answer
[1:00:55] back
[1:00:56] because he sin you know and and God said
[1:00:59] to him just you know don't do this I
[1:01:01] think you shouldn't you should have
[1:01:02] killed what's his name
[1:01:04] um
[1:01:04] yeah a gag you should have just utterly
[1:01:06] destroyed him and he didn't and God said
[1:01:09] not not happy with you you know this is
[1:01:11] where it stops and now he gets to a
[1:01:13] place where he's actually in in in he
[1:01:16] wants the the Council of God and he goes
[1:01:18] seeks it through that that um Witch of
[1:01:21] indoor
[1:01:22] and he goes to a so desperate to hear
[1:01:24] from God
[1:01:25] but he still does it his way
[1:01:28] he doesn't wait he doesn't and he
[1:01:30] doesn't understand so he goes another
[1:01:31] Channel and Samuel says this day you'll
[1:01:33] you'll be tomorrow this time you and
[1:01:35] your son will be will be dead so has all
[1:01:38] gone to hell just to answer that
[1:01:40] question no
[1:01:41] okay what God says if you're saved
[1:01:44] you're saved you cannot be unsaved
[1:01:46] unless you grieve the Holy Spirit it
[1:01:48] says grieve not the Holy Spirit how you
[1:01:49] grieve the holy spirit is if you
[1:01:51] actually say I don't want you I and you
[1:01:54] openly cast say Lord I don't want your
[1:01:56] way okay that's the only way I feel my
[1:01:59] I'm saying it that you you push God
[1:02:01] totally away in your life
[1:02:03] okay but what happens is if God puts a
[1:02:06] evil spirit upon you like Saul Saul the
[1:02:10] evil spirit Came Upon Soul because he
[1:02:11] opened himself for it but God had to get
[1:02:14] David into position so he was going to
[1:02:16] use Saul as an instrument to get David
[1:02:19] into his position
[1:02:21] so don't get it wrong so if somebody
[1:02:22] gets really sick or somebody changes and
[1:02:25] they're a little bit angry and they get
[1:02:26] all my just pray for them because no
[1:02:29] matter what God does God does don't try
[1:02:31] to do God's work don't try to understand
[1:02:33] what he's doing just keep praying for
[1:02:36] that person because God might only
[1:02:37] anoint him for a season to push you into
[1:02:40] your position or somebody else close to
[1:02:42] them so don't get worried if somebody is
[1:02:45] looking like they're off the rails
[1:02:46] that's not God's final say if he said
[1:02:49] it's done it's done if he gave you the
[1:02:51] Holy Ghost if he sealed you to the day
[1:02:53] if you received a Redemption it's done
[1:02:56] he sealed you he will not unseal you and
[1:02:58] brother Benham if you want to question
[1:02:59] and answers he answers it I think it's
[1:03:02] in 59 because I went in there because I
[1:03:05] thought man how could he give
[1:03:07] um 59 12 19 questions and answers he
[1:03:11] says every spirit is subjected to God
[1:03:14] um just remember that and he speaks
[1:03:15] about Joseph fate and ayab and all how
[1:03:17] he made those prophets lie so don't you
[1:03:20] worry if somebody is acting out pray for
[1:03:22] them
[1:03:24] pray for them it's okay so you'll go
[1:03:26] David goes to
[1:03:27] goes to war and now he goes and he wants
[1:03:31] to fight gets to war and God is mindful
[1:03:33] to keep his word because he will not let
[1:03:36] the King fight his own people because
[1:03:38] that is a kingdom against itself divided
[1:03:40] amongst itself shall not stand cannot so
[1:03:44] if it works for Satan if it if Satan
[1:03:46] cannot be divided why would God fight
[1:03:48] his own people okay so God cannot break
[1:03:51] the scriptures so now he gets David
[1:03:53] right to the enemy line right to his
[1:03:55] friendly fire line I would say and he
[1:03:57] goes now and go back home
[1:03:59] and all the Philistine King says no man
[1:04:00] we don't want this guy because he's got
[1:04:02] a reputation you know we just lost 200
[1:04:04] good soldiers just for a bit to get a
[1:04:06] wife you know so let's just let's just
[1:04:09] pull back boys this guy's dangerous he
[1:04:11] was he was so anointed man think about
[1:04:14] it huh so safe to go get me go get me
[1:04:17] the the four skins of 200 Philistines if
[1:04:19] you want um Michael
[1:04:22] if you want to just go get it he grabs a
[1:04:24] couple of guys and goes boys here we go
[1:04:25] there we go not doubting it comes back
[1:04:28] to underskins there you go you said 100
[1:04:29] I got you 200.
[1:04:31] he's so anointed and now he's gonna go
[1:04:34] and fight against his own people and the
[1:04:36] enemy the enemy noticed there's
[1:04:39] something wrong not David the enemy
[1:04:41] stops and go Hawkeye boys something's
[1:04:44] wrong he killed Goliath he killed 200 of
[1:04:47] our finest men now all of a sudden he's
[1:04:50] standing here and he's fighting for us
[1:04:51] is there something wrong here
[1:04:54] and they say not sending him home and he
[1:04:57] regrettedly goes home now he gets to the
[1:04:59] ziglag moment and he sees everything is
[1:05:02] done and what happens
[1:05:04] he falls on his Rejoice he rejoices in
[1:05:07] the Lord and says Lord you know what
[1:05:08] it's happened but I now remember what I
[1:05:12] was supposed to do oh I was supposed to
[1:05:14] hate the Philistines because when he
[1:05:17] went to fight and he fought and he got
[1:05:19] everything back in that time the
[1:05:20] Philistines destroyed Seoul and Jonathan
[1:05:23] and he loved Jonathan so much and the
[1:05:25] News comes to David now and he's just
[1:05:27] come back from that war got everything
[1:05:29] back rejoicing spread this massive
[1:05:31] Slaughter he just got all cows and and
[1:05:34] animals and he gives it to everyone many
[1:05:36] gives to everyone okay that's how much
[1:05:38] he got back and more
[1:05:40] and then they come to him and they say
[1:05:42] soul
[1:05:44] and Jonathan's date
[1:05:45] and something just goes
[1:05:49] and he goes oh yeah
[1:05:52] are supposed to hate these guys
[1:05:54] I'm supposed to to destroy them supposed
[1:05:57] to be a king
[1:05:58] and he turns around and he starts
[1:06:00] becoming a king and he takes them in and
[1:06:02] he gathers to himself and he starts
[1:06:04] pushing up and he takes Judah back and
[1:06:06] he starts rolling ruling the house of
[1:06:08] Judah and he starts being being a leader
[1:06:10] but now all of a sudden a little
[1:06:13] situation where people wanted to Stone
[1:06:14] him turns around and now all of a sudden
[1:06:17] they go with him and within this time
[1:06:19] when they go and get everything from
[1:06:20] zekeg I hope you follow me I didn't lose
[1:06:22] you now he's going now to go get
[1:06:24] everything back that was taken from
[1:06:25] zieglag left 200 men behind then when
[1:06:28] the all 400 men came back because it was
[1:06:30] 600 400 came back and they said no we're
[1:06:32] not going to give these guys any of the
[1:06:33] spoil what did David do
[1:06:35] he goes if they fight or if they stay if
[1:06:39] they play or if they worship they all
[1:06:42] get the same
[1:06:45] if it's a preacher or a cleaner or a
[1:06:48] evangelist or a prophet or whatever
[1:06:50] don't you worry I just want you all just
[1:06:53] to just remember I if if we come to the
[1:06:55] word of God you get the same
[1:06:57] get the same we don't get less or more
[1:06:59] we don't get more healing because you're
[1:07:01] a pastor sorry brother being you know
[1:07:03] you don't get you don't because you
[1:07:04] stand here and you're this massive cool
[1:07:06] awesome song leader then then when the
[1:07:08] trial comes he goes I remember Lord I'm
[1:07:09] a song leader and he gives you more we
[1:07:11] all the same
[1:07:13] I'm not saying anything bad I want you
[1:07:15] to realize there's no big or small we
[1:07:17] don't need a little platform here to get
[1:07:20] someone higher and closer to God
[1:07:22] we're all the same the only thing is the
[1:07:24] gift that God placed in your midst
[1:07:26] respected your pastor because he's the
[1:07:29] one that has the closest contact with
[1:07:31] God for the will for us here as Shekinah
[1:07:33] and that's it why this one in taranaki
[1:07:35] and that's why there's one in Auckland
[1:07:37] or two or three or four now that's why
[1:07:39] God faces them everywhere because
[1:07:40] they're different people in different
[1:07:42] places and God takes a different lure to
[1:07:45] keep you in your place because what
[1:07:46] happens in this church might not be the
[1:07:49] same as with taranaki and we don't we we
[1:07:51] won't you know our fellowship is
[1:07:53] different than these and same as with
[1:07:54] Auckland we are made different that's
[1:07:56] the reason for it but the man himself
[1:07:59] brother being bleached just like us
[1:08:01] he prays just like you
[1:08:03] you know he's got also frustrations I
[1:08:05] know him I I had a privilege of you know
[1:08:08] being close to him for a couple of years
[1:08:10] and man praise the Lord thank you for
[1:08:11] that man you know
[1:08:13] um so I just want to tell you and I
[1:08:15] don't want to lose the trait of this
[1:08:16] David hit a Ziegler moment and things
[1:08:19] were going wrong in his life
[1:08:22] because he wasn't in where God wanted
[1:08:24] him
[1:08:25] but you know what if he didn't stop and
[1:08:27] rejoice in the Lord and got back to
[1:08:29] where God wanted him
[1:08:31] then he would have lost all
[1:08:33] but see God being mindful of this
[1:08:37] said I will move you I will move Havens
[1:08:40] and Earth I will get you in your place
[1:08:41] if it hurts sorry
[1:08:45] brother Ben has a cool testimony I wish
[1:08:47] he shares it one day that he he's like
[1:08:49] and it got you out of work for how long
[1:08:51] ACC and you were just you're just like I
[1:08:54] just don't know why do any weeks you
[1:08:56] just stopped me
[1:08:58] but you knew it was God stopping you
[1:09:00] what did you start doing you start
[1:09:01] praying say Lord why am I here
[1:09:04] what what's going on you know and that's
[1:09:07] how we should be but pushing on in your
[1:09:09] own strength keep going on don't give up
[1:09:11] don't go lie down and uh and why me why
[1:09:13] now you know just don't do that all you
[1:09:15] have to do is just keep push forward but
[1:09:17] keep in mind this if something happens
[1:09:18] in your life what does God want from you
[1:09:22] because if you don't act on it he's
[1:09:24] going to bring you a trial he's going to
[1:09:25] bring you a Ziegler moment he's going to
[1:09:27] stop you on your tracks and he's going
[1:09:28] to get you back in that way
[1:09:29] but praise the Lord he does do that or
[1:09:32] else we would we be amen
[1:09:35] um
[1:09:37] yeah maybe last thing and then you know
[1:09:39] musicians you can come up maybe the last
[1:09:41] thing I want you to realize is

[1:10:57] he's a king
[1:10:59] anointed by God chosen by God
[1:11:02] to be a king of Israel
[1:11:05] and he came to a place where he forgot
[1:11:07] who he was
[1:11:10] but God had to bring such a great event
[1:11:12] in his life that it had to the the they
[1:11:16] they cried so much when they saw their
[1:11:18] family was gone they cried so much they
[1:11:21] didn't have energy they didn't have any
[1:11:23] any strength left they they were gone
[1:11:26] they were so drained with this event and
[1:11:29] emotionally drained
[1:11:31] and God did that to get their attention
[1:11:33] to say don't do it your way
[1:11:37] so I encourage all of us
[1:11:39] stay off devices
[1:11:41] as much as you can get away from YouTube
[1:11:45] Pinterest is a bunch of nonsense I'm
[1:11:47] talking to the kids this is my burden is
[1:11:49] you
[1:11:51] David forgot his identity
[1:11:55] and if it was different he could have
[1:11:57] lost his wife and kids
[1:11:59] if God wasn't merciful because they were
[1:12:01] already gone what if they came to
[1:12:03] Ziegler and everything was destroyed
[1:12:06] just to make this to get him back in his
[1:12:08] place
[1:12:09] so I'm telling you stay with those
[1:12:12] things
[1:12:13] you know why don't you put I encourage
[1:12:16] you why don't you just take a phone
[1:12:17] whoever has a phone thank the Lord
[1:12:19] Reuben you'll get one just after the
[1:12:21] Rapture and Liam YouTube
[1:12:23] take your phone for a week
[1:12:26] I'm I encourage you put it at do not
[1:12:29] disturb from four o'clock the afternoon
[1:12:32] to the next morning nine o'clock
[1:12:34] kids parents may be here from eight
[1:12:37] because you've got jobs and everything
[1:12:38] from F4 to eight you know just put on
[1:12:41] dinner if somebody wants to reach you
[1:12:42] they'll call you twice okay and just put
[1:12:45] the sound
[1:12:48] spend time with your family spend time
[1:12:50] with God
[1:12:52] because we are so entrapped with this
[1:12:54] world we're actually forgetting Who We
[1:12:56] Are we're forgetting our we're
[1:12:58] forgetting where our strength lies we
[1:13:01] forget the power of prayer we forget
[1:13:03] that actually I've got a brother that
[1:13:04] still needs to come in we forget that
[1:13:07] I've got a family that needs healing and
[1:13:09] prayer I forget that these people on the
[1:13:11] other side of the world struggling
[1:13:14] because I'm so lost In This Moment
[1:13:18] then I forget my identity
[1:13:21] please do it I I encourage you please
[1:13:25] put it down
[1:13:26] it would be the greatest blessing I'm
[1:13:29] telling you now that would happen to you
[1:13:32] forget books Forget music you know what
[1:13:35] seriously even if you stop music for a
[1:13:38] week give your brain a chance to think
[1:13:40] on the Lord it says meditate upon the
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:44] how can you meditate if your head is
[1:13:46] spinning at a million miles a moment
[1:13:47] every day spinning spinning spinning
[1:13:50] spinning the song that song this that
[1:13:51] this read this do that
[1:13:53] how can you meditate upon the word of
[1:13:56] God if everything in here is everywhere
[1:13:59] out there
[1:14:00] how can you have peace how can you say
[1:14:03] Lord you know what thank you for this
[1:14:06] awesome day
[1:14:08] you know what
[1:14:10] Jonah could have gotten really hurt
[1:14:12] thank you Lord for protecting him
[1:14:14] because then the little things you start
[1:14:16] seeing God but when you're on all these
[1:14:19] other things there is no God
[1:14:22] because you're so busy you don't think
[1:14:25] about it
[1:14:26] so how is it having a relationship with
[1:14:28] God if it's only coming from one place
[1:14:30] only from him how's that a relationship
[1:14:34] there was a thief that got into the back
[1:14:37] part of Heaven he come through a window
[1:14:39] got into the The Waiting feast
[1:14:41] okay he was a brother let's call him a
[1:14:44] brother brother without a waiting robe
[1:14:47] you know garment or whatever
[1:14:48] and Jesus comes and he looks at this man
[1:14:50] and he says Hey where's your rope
[1:14:54] how did you get here
[1:14:57] and he said I came by the window okay
[1:14:59] guys take him through him out I don't
[1:15:02] know you you worker of iniquity
[1:15:05] I don't know you you don't know me
[1:15:07] because if you knew me you knew you had
[1:15:09] to come through the door
[1:15:12] so I don't want to turn this into a bed
[1:15:14] I just want you to realize that that
[1:15:16] busyness got David in a Ziegler moment
[1:15:19] where he had to look at destruction of a
[1:15:21] city that he owned which was not his in
[1:15:23] the first place but it's still to the
[1:15:24] tribal Judah this day and he and he was
[1:15:27] looking at that City and he was in such
[1:15:29] a way that he was thinking he's a
[1:15:30] Philistine
[1:15:33] I'm a worldly person I belong in soccer
[1:15:35] and I belong in cricket and I belong in
[1:15:38] music and and this is my genre and this
[1:15:41] is my identity because what happens is
[1:15:43] he got distracted
[1:15:45] and because he couldn't find Joy there
[1:15:47] because he wasn't wanting to find Joy
[1:15:49] there he went to find Joy there
[1:15:51] he wanted to find peace in the
[1:15:53] Philistine camp
[1:15:54] because all David wanted was peace I
[1:15:57] just want peace God
[1:15:59] I want peace I don't want soul to try to
[1:16:01] kill me every day I don't want to be
[1:16:03] like a vagabond year and day and then
[1:16:05] there and I just want my family I just
[1:16:07] want peace
[1:16:09] but he was in the wrong camp
[1:16:12] and that's where our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:14] steps in and he starts moving you but
[1:16:16] you don't need to go there
[1:16:19] so I encourage you put those things down
[1:16:21] put the things of the world down put
[1:16:23] anything that will distract you down put
[1:16:25] it down
[1:16:27] seek first the kingdom of God you will
[1:16:29] never ever ever be disappointed
[1:16:34] go take proverbs 3.
[1:16:36] stick it on your fridge stick it on your
[1:16:39] wall
[1:16:40] it's a promise
[1:16:42] if you keep my Commandments I will guide
[1:16:45] you all the way there
[1:16:48] if you meditate upon the Lord he will
[1:16:50] come down he will meet with you
[1:16:53] if you pray without seizing pray without
[1:16:55] ceasing is walking and talking to God
[1:16:57] every day of your life
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:00] take phones away
[1:17:02] take emails away take anything that
[1:17:04] would distract you after fall because
[1:17:06] guess what by the time you get to nine
[1:17:09] o'clock you haven't done anything for
[1:17:10] the Lord not one thing
[1:17:13] because we have to mow lawn
[1:17:15] we have to get everything ready then we
[1:17:17] have to quickly say hey family prayer
[1:17:19] all in a bed another but you not you
[1:17:22] have not communed with your lord

[1:17:26] you're sitting there on the bed okay
[1:17:28] it's to 11 o'clock where's your time
[1:17:31] with the Lord
[1:17:32] but we're quick to do this
[1:17:36] just to do more videos
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] I'm not a liar I I do this as well
[1:17:43] but when the god when God corrects you
[1:17:45] when God shows you the way when he gives
[1:17:47] you a zekeg moment and he says to you I
[1:17:49] don't want you to do this don't do it
[1:17:52] don't do it
[1:17:54] this is not me speaking this was not in
[1:17:56] my notes my notes was if you come to a
[1:17:59] place where God moves you stop
[1:18:02] and ask him where that was my notes my
[1:18:06] notes wasn't this stuff but I do feel
[1:18:07] that this is a big a big hinderest
[1:18:14] keep playing that song sister Diana
[1:18:16] I want to encourage you tonight
[1:18:19] close your eyes
[1:18:21] it's not even nine o'clock we still win
[1:18:23] plenty of time close your eyes don't
[1:18:26] look at anyone
[1:18:28] okay if you feel
[1:18:31] in your heart I don't want uplifted
[1:18:33] hands I don't want anything like that I
[1:18:35] want you to clearly think about your
[1:18:37] life tonight
[1:18:38] think about the amount of time you spent
[1:18:41] outside fellowship with the Lord
[1:18:46] so all I want you to do is think how
[1:18:48] many times your mind goes to work
[1:18:50] to soccer to to music to anything that
[1:18:55] is not
[1:18:57] from the Lord
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:18:59] now think about the times
[1:19:02] when you were praying in your room
[1:19:05] or when you were praying with someone
[1:19:08] you could feel God drop down right there
[1:19:12] right there you could feel the presence
[1:19:14] of the almighty God coming to that room
[1:19:16] we had a pre-meaning of brother binster
[1:19:18] one night
[1:19:19] and it was the most amazing feeling
[1:19:22] knowing that deity just entered the room
[1:19:25] don't you want to be in that place every
[1:19:27] day
[1:19:30] don't you want to be in a place where
[1:19:32] your mind is so clear then when God says
[1:19:34] I want you to move
[1:19:37] I want you to pray for brother Armando I
[1:19:40] want you to go to sister tipian say to
[1:19:43] her I love her
[1:19:45] do you not want to hear the word of God

[1:19:54] you want to just flick to the next video
[1:19:55] what do you want tonight
[1:19:59] what do you want
[1:20:01] because God can deliver you from that
[1:20:03] right now
[1:20:05] right now he can take that desire out of
[1:20:08] you right now
[1:20:09] you confess it unto the Lord I don't
[1:20:11] want to I don't want anything fancy I
[1:20:14] want the real moment between you and God
[1:20:15] and say Lord search my life right now
[1:20:18] right now and tell me how can I go a
[1:20:22] little bit closer to you what can I let
[1:20:25] go to receive more of you
[1:20:28] I want to give myself away tonight
[1:20:31] I want to give myself away to you Lord
[1:20:34] Jesus
[1:20:37] if there's anybody
[1:20:39] that is here tonight and just want to
[1:20:42] ask the Lord
[1:20:43] you can uplift your head nobody watch
[1:20:45] please look down
[1:20:47] say Lord Jesus
[1:20:50] I know I am at that David moment where
[1:20:53] things are happening and confusion is in
[1:20:56] my heart and I don't quite understand
[1:20:58] what I'm doing here and I've got to
[1:21:01] ought either against a brother or a
[1:21:02] sister or or I'm actually in a point
[1:21:04] Lord where this device is taking over my
[1:21:07] life it's actually running my mind and
[1:21:10] keeping it busy I have no Clarity of
[1:21:12] thought I have no singleness of Mind
