Welcome to the house of God. How you feeling? Good, happy, saved. Your soul is eternal. Amen. Then we're good. It's all good. Praise the Lord. Let's um stand this morning. I already feel a nice atmosphere here and I believe um the Lord's going to bless us in a powerful way here this morning. We are coming to the solution this morning. Life gives us us a lot of problems. But you know as believers we can when we when we come to the Lord we come to the solution of everything. You know, like like like um Jonah when he was in the belly of the whale, he could have looked a lot of at a lot of different directions to towards his problem, but he chose to look to the solution. I'll look to thy holy till to thy temple. I I'll face where the the direction of you, Lord, where you are, and I'll look to you. And he looked to the solution. And not long after that, he got spat up on the beach. If you're in the belly of a whale this morning, if you just looked for the solution, eventually you'll get spat up on the beach and it will all fall into [Music] place. You know, God's ways are far above our ways. He He We sing a song, he makes a way where there is no way, you know. You know, like his ways are he's just got a way of working working complex things out and making them all simple. Amen. So, let's just pray this morning. Heavenly Father, we so grateful that we can look to you this morning, Lord, as the solution, Lord, that we as Lord, the the objective of our life, Lord, is just to look to you, Lord. There's many distractions in this world that we can look to other things. We can look here, look there, look all around. But Lord, we come here this morning to look to you, Lord Jesus. Where there's a song that says, "Look and live, my brother, live, my sister, live, Lord. We we look to you, Lord, and we believe you're the answer to all things. And we just want to look to you and live this morning, Lord. and just pray that you'd continue to shine your face upon us, Lord. That the light of your countenance would shine upon us this morning, Lord. Just bless us. Bless the songs, bless the ministry, bless the specials. We're under great expectation, Lord, to receive from you this morning, Lord. We believe you're already in our midst, Lord. And you're going to bless us in a powerful way. We're going to leave here refreshed, renewed, Lord, full of faith, encouraged, Lord, strengthened for the the journey ahead, Lord. So, we just want to commit the service to your hands, Lord, and just pray your continued blessing upon us in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Praise the Lord.

And we'll ask um Fish and his family to come up first. that that uh turn me on that um just where they're getting ready that the author of that song was a lady Fanny Crosby. She wrote a lot of different hymns and she was um blind. Yeah. So she wrote a song called I know him by the nail prints in his hand. But you know that song came because people were making fun of her that oh how you going to know what he looks like when you see him? You know you're blind. And she she her response was, "I'll know him by the nail prints in his hand." And she wrote a song with that same name. Brother Fish, you're really pulling ahead in the specials department. [Music] Bring your tide. Bring your shame. name. Bring your guilt and bring your pain. Don't you know that's not your name? Oh, you always mean much more to me. And every day I wrestle with the voices that you tell me I'm not right. That's all right. And so I hear the voice and he calls me redeemed when others say I'll never be enough. And greater is the one living inside of me than he who's living in the world. In the world. In the [Music] world. And greater is the one living inside of me than he who is living in the world. Bring your doubts. Bring your tears. Bring your hurt and bring your tears. There'll be no conflation here. Oh, you holy righteous and redeemed. And every day I will there'll be those who will call me a mistake. But that's okay. Cuz I hear the voice and he calls me redeemed. When others say I'll never be enough. And greater is the one living inside of me than he who is living in the world. In the world. In the world. There'll be days I lose a battle. Grace says it doesn't matter cuz the cross already won. The war is greater. He's greater. I'm learning to run freely. Understand just how he sees me. And it makes me love him more and more. He's greater. He's greater. Cuz I hear the voice and he calls me redeemed. When others say I'll never be enough. And greater is the one living inside of me than he who is living in the world. In the [Music] world in the world.
