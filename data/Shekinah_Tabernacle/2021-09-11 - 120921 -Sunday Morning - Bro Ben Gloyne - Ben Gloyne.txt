========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the lord good morning everybody welcome to church this morning it's good to have an opportunity to serve the lord again regardless of what our circumstances might be or our restrictions might be we are we've come here this morning to worship the lord and we're under great expectation that we're going to meet a supernatural god this morning to minister to us who's feeling good ready to praise the lord ready to put off all the the natural things that that so easily consume us and look at the supernatural this morning look at the the unseen god you know that that's that's everywhere and if we just surrender we can actually access this unseen god and actually his handiwork his handiwork is actually even though he's the unseen god his handiwork is all through the universe you know the creation all creation declares almighty god everywhere you look and that's what i love about the word of god is that i can relate it to things that i see the wisdom in the word of god i can relate it to to creation to how the ecosystem works how the animals work the different personalities it's all because it's the same the same the same god that wrote this made the universe so you know and when someone does the same thing it's kind of got their little um their their style on it you know so i like i love how i can look in creation and see the style of god see the thoughts of god portrayed in in creation and the way the animals work like god said about the ostrich you know i've made that ostrich void of wisdom it will just lay its eggs in the sand bury them over and just leave them here and doesn't it doesn't think maybe someone will stand on the eggs and my eggs the eggs will get ruined but an ostrich it doesn't really god said i've given made that ostrich void of wisdom so it will do something that's not good and we can relate it to us and think lord may you give me wisdom so i don't do things that are not good like we we can we can learn all these lessons so let's um stand this morning and we'll just um open the service and just commit this time to the lord heavenly father we're so grateful lord that we can enter into your house this morning lord and we're under great expectation to meet with you this morning lord we need you every hour lord you're the one that changes our life you're the one that makes our life worthwhile lord you're the one that that satisfies our hearts lord jesus lord there's no satisfaction outside of you regardless of whatever thing we may do or accomplish or anything like that lord there's no satisfaction outside of being in your presence lord and being under the shadow of your winged lord jesus so we just wanted to invite you into our midst this morning may bless us lord may visit us in a powerful way lord jesus lord may we may our hearts be changed lord and may we be like those that walked along the road to emmaus daughters they said did not our hearts burned within us as he spoke with us along the way may bless the ministry that comes forth this morning may each heart be be receptive lord and we believe that we serve a supernatural god and we believe that we serve we're a fellowship that that surrenders to your spirit lord so we're under great expectation lord that the words that we hear this morning won't be from a man's lips lord but it'll be from the very heart of

we're going to go to verse 14 here just a couple of scriptures amen praise the lord so galatians 6 and 14. amen that's everyone there hey man i want to say happy anniversary to the cliffords god bless you they're watching so happy anniversary believe us today amen galatians 6 and 14 it says but god forbid that i should glory saving the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god amen this bow he's in a word of prayer this morning gracious heavenly father we are so thankful we can sing with a real feeling in our love you can take this whole world but give me jesus all we want is you lord we're so thankful that you're our god lord you are closer than our next breath to us you are all together lovely and i thank you dear god we can gather yeah i

like they're on the front row may your presence be so real to them and dear god we just want to come before you this morning asking that you'd forgive us of all of our sins all of our trespasses may cleanse us of all iniquities may your blood just cleanse us oh god and we want to thank you for your presence thank you you are the same yesterday today and forever may touch all every need here lord jesus whether in body or in spirit lord i pray and move on every situation for your glory we thank you dear god just pray lord as we've read a few scriptures from your word lord we know it's not necessarily the length of the scripture reading but lord it's what's contained in your word and we know it's you in print form so we ask you once again lord can you come and make your word live in our hearts once again may you anoint it for your glory to speak and to hearer in jesus christ's name may you grant it amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning um i'd like to speak on this here if you want to can you put up yet down a little bit can you put those three scriptures up on the projector can we do that um now the apostle paul was a very uh unique individual in a way uh compared to the world he was an oddball he was a strange character uh from what he was to what he became in the lord jesus christ but i was listening to the audio book of the book of galatians yesterday and this and these scriptures really jumped out to me where the apostle paul because you know in the galatians we know he is dealing with legalism has come in amongst the believers they the the light of a former age of being under the law has come in among the believers and now the believer's being swayed back into trying to keep the law and you know any and he asks you know the question in in the book of galatians he says you know does does he that you know does miracles among you does he do it by keeping the law or is it preaching the word and you know or you know the spirit working among you is it by keeping the law or is it by the by the law of faith and he shows them really that circumcision around circumcision it doesn't avail anything but them but but but it's being a new creature it's verse 15 it's it's being a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god so so he he he's coming down to this conclusion he's wanting the people to see it's not that you keep certain a circumcision of traditions of you know how things used to be or even uncircumcision so it's not being liberal or legal if i can put it that way it's actually it's it's what avails as being a new creature in christ that's really the power i mean that's released is through the new birth it says as many walk according to this rule then peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god now the apostle paul if you know if we could step back into his time he lived in a very politically charged environment you know when you when you look into the into when titus came and he beseeched jerusalem and he massacred most of the city and he destroyed the city and you know not one stone was you know the temple was laid upon another and you know they carried away the jewish people into slavery and they took all the treasures of the city away you know that didn't just happen overnight but there was a simmering of a of an uprising that was there and there was political there were factions being developed and you know there was you know there were pools of you know are you forestry against us are you on this side here on that side you know and you can't be in the middle either you're for us or against us are you for the romans you're against the romans are you for a jewish liberty or are you against the jewish liberty are you for the jews having their own nation are you against it you can't be you can't be in the middle this is how polarizing the world was just before destruction was going to hit it was very polarizing and i feel where we have come back to this place but not just the city but the whole world not just a city not just a nation but the whole world because tribulation's coming we understand that but the apostle paul walked in such a way where those things didn't pull him left or right those things didn't sway him he wasn't on anyone's side he was on the lord's side and even even the thing is because there was a blindness coming upon people you know you know upon the jews different things were going on there that people were being pulled back into into into the traditions of the fathers instead of walking in the light of the gospel and it's the same thing today where people can look back and say this is what the reformers did this is what other ages did and they try and pattern themselves after a former thing but we're not called to patent ourselves after a former age we're called to patent ourselves after the word of god for this age which is the full word of god but see see the galatians that spirit that lukewarm spirit came into the galatian church to make them be something they weren't called to be they weren't called to be under the law right they were called to walk in the power of the resurrection and so he's saying here that it's that it's that if it's actually being a new creature that what avails now i'm going to break this down but you know the apostle paul knew he was upon the earth for a purpose right he knew he wasn't there for a haphazard reason or just because he felt like changing churches it wasn't that kind of thing no he met the lord on the road to damascus it transformed his life he was a man who was a pharisee of the pharisees very devote man we know this right but then god met him in such a supernatural way that his whole life became new and he counted everything he once did but dung that he would win christ right so everything else in his life he put it in one category dung amen and that's how we've got to be all of our life we've got to when it compares to the lord it's got to be done our career our our whatever we think we are our former religious ways it's got to be done and so the apostle paul was trying to get the galatians to see no it is the power of the new birth and as many as walk in this rule peace be on them i'm going to repeat this a bit because what rule are we walking after is it the rule of our own minds or our own ideas was actually walking and really you know brother brown makes a statement he says if the church only realized her position she will one day then the rapture will go and i believe the rapture will be in you know it could be in times like this why not oh no we're going to go back to how it was who says the world's going to go back to how it was right we shouldn't be looking for a living in some dream of the future no what about right now right now is the best time right now is the best time to be alive right now i heard brother brahm said that a father could have put him on the you know you know you know you know before time could have could have actually asked him when do you want to preach the gospel do you want to preach it you know you could pick any age you wanted he said i would have picked right now hallelujah and and to me that's how i feel it would have been amazing to be there at jesus's feet when he was there at his first coming it would have been amazing even you know to be there with the apostle paul or you know through one of the great moves of reformation it would have been amazing then but right now even it's better to be alive now than in 1965 when the prophet was here this is a better day hallelujah amen now brother bam says and i know and and and i've um shared this before but it's in those crucial hours that press us on those sacred sands it was in the bible remember no matter how great the distress is satan cannot take your life until god is finished with you there is nothing can happen to you unless god permits it there is nothing that can happen to you unless god permits it who believes that everything god is in charge satan's not in charge god has the final say god has to satan has to actually ask permission from god if he can do anything to you amen amen so there's nothing can happen to you unless god permits it there's no evil can come unless god permits it and it's for your good he is working that now let's think when the floods came to destroy the world it could not destroy noah no it could not be destroyed because that god had a work for him to do one day down in a great nation under a great bondage there are some hebrew children that we know as shadrach meshach and abednego and it came to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done their faith was put to a test and when your faith is put to a test then don't fail stay right with what you believe we have a choice right we have a choice we're going to stay with what we believe are we just going to you know are we going to just just compromise a little bit right when your faith is put to a test then don't fail state stay with what you believe and when your faith is put to a test and they went to a crucial hour not only did they go to an ash heap but they went into a fiery furnace but satan could not destroy them for god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope i know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope here we are assured that god is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to the image satan could not take them he could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children till the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and trouble so the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel to the god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and why does let god why does god let trouble come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god the apostle paul understood this he he could recount he's been shipwrecked he's been beaten 40 times yeah i mean i mean 40 stripes three times and you know he's been stoned you know he went through great persecutions he was chased he would have a meeting in one city and people actually resented his preaching and when he went to the other city those people would follow him and they would stir up the people against him and you know he would end up in jail in many places this was this was the life he kind of lived but these things didn't sway him hallelujah when he stood there in acts 26 and and and he was testifying to king agrippa of the account of the road to damascus and how he met the lord um he would he would say after he um after he gave that account he says we're upon king agrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision that was tested he didn't have a flowery bed of ease i mean he was tested in that but he says i was not disobedient king agrippa he could have he could have put into that testimony i've been shipwrecked i've been beaten false brethren have come in without great distress and troubles and things going on but i have not been no disobedient to this heavenly vision and it should be the same thing with you and i you know this message coming as a heavenly vision to you and i where the word came open and gave you purpose in life to show you actually you're not from this terra firma you're from heaven amen that you're a son or daughter of god hallelujah amen now when the apostle paul would say there that the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world he was saying that world sorry that word world it speaks of the world order or the cosmos so this is what he is saying is dead to him the world affairs and the aggregate of earthly things so every earthly thing is dead to him this is what he's saying he just says it in in a few words but he's actually now this is his testimony being spoken he this is not just a nice idea or some instagram post or you know something on social media this is a living reality actually the world has been crucified to me i have no longing or desire to further myself in this world i was once a pharisee and i and and and i had a burden i'm going to climb the ivory tower being a pharisee i'm going to be the next best greatest pharisee that you know there's ever been he had political ambition in that too right but when the lord met him that died that died amen the only burden he had was the salvation of his people amen and getting the gospel to the gentiles he writes a lot about that he says i wish i was a castaway that is israel would be saved right but he says he says for the gentile sake they're blinded that the gentiles can come in but his burden was i want to see my nation saved so that was that was the thing that that burdened him amen why because he was he was living by this heavenly vision this was the thing that consumed him are you with me i mean this is the thing that you could say bothered him he wanted to see so the the salvation of his people he wanted to see people meet the lord so the world affairs the aggregate of earthly things now this is from the thales uh bible dictionary it says the whole circle of earthly goods endowments riches advantages pleasures etc that although hollow and frail and fleeting they stir desire and they seduce from god and our obstacles to the cause of christ this is the world cosmos so it stirs a desire there's a lot of things on the earth right now that are trending that are stirring desires i'm not just saying a desire for a new new car new house holiday no there's a desire of well i'm against this and i'm for this right vaccine no vaccine locked down no lockdown this this you know all the political movements on the earth that those stir debate they stir desire and you can't for some reason you can't be in the middle and just be actually no that's not our main problem here our main problem is if i can say the word problem is there's a tribulation coming and everyone better get in the ark don't just hang around it and look at it and sympathize get into jesus christ really surrender your life to him amen give your all to him amen this may be the last time we stand in this building i was thinking about this and probably you say well you're just getting emotional stirred up no no maybe if this is the last service we're ever in i don't want to stand at the judgment bar and say i didn't warn those people whoever's on the internet you better meet jesus christ you really better be sure don't just numb your conscience and say i'm a good person forget the good persons there'll be a lot of good people to be disappointed that day we want to be in jesus christ it doesn't matter how old or young we are you've got to give up and let him take over amen because that's what avails a new birth that's what has power amen but let's just go back to this i'm not done and are obstacles to the cause of christ anything that is your rallying cry above the lord is an obstacle to the cause of christ because what's the main thing at the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks or what's in the heart whatever's in there's gonna come out i mean so so you know and your heart's only you know like brother paul had the containers showing the lord washing and cleansing us those containers had a certain volume right and you could pour oil or you can pour in all different kind of chemicals in there but there's a certain volume that it can possess it's the same thing with our hearts it has a limited capacity but what's it filled with is it filled with nonsense you know brother brown said that people will go insane in the end time and there's a lot of videos on social media people are insane they put filters on their faces and videos to make them look crazy and demon possessed they do crazy stuff what is it that's insanity coming on the streets and it's actually made to look normal but the problem is there's too many crazies for the same people to lock them up and give them treatment it's true you say well that's a bit much no that's true it's become normal why because our senses have been dulled down you know it wasn't that long ago upon this earth that you know women who walked along half naked in the street they are locked up or drunks were picked up and put in prison cells to sober up imagine trying to do that in wellington on a on a saturday night you'd need a way bigger prison than we have you would need a lot more police but now it's just well it's okay no i feel sorry for people trapped in that kind of bondage i was in that bondage it's a horrible task master you wake up and say you'll never do it again you find yourself doing it again and you can't break it but god comes down and breaks it takes a desire out of your life and you walk free amen that's what happened to me i saw a man it was such a good feeling when i realized i have no desire anymore where did that go god took it hallelujah amen praise our god amen so anything that that that is actually first anything contrary to the word of god he said but what about my family what's the burden you have for your family right should be the salvation that they would prosper spiritually seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and everything else will be added right you know who cares about all the money in the world you know i would not want to trade my life with the guy who owns amazon or bill gates or any of those people who got silly money they don't know what to do i wouldn't want to trade my life with them for the world not for a day i would rather keep this hallelujah i'd rather keep this because everyone's got an expiry date some have come at shorter some comment later but then even after all that everyone's going to stand before god and give an account what did you do with me when i came across your path did you give yourself or did you turn me down and of course the answer's already flashing there you know god doesn't have to come to a conclusion he knows what the conclusion is i'm glad we can stand in this day sensible minds and say lord i give you my all i give you my life hallelujah amen so that word avail he says it doesn't avail well i can't yeah i was joking i can't see that very good yeah the screen's shrunk someone put one yeah now see he says this see for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature so he says it doesn't avail anything he doesn't even say it doesn't avail much it doesn't avail anything so basically it's just empty there's no value to it there's no substance there's nothing that's actually going to do anything even this would uh avail available it means it means to have power to exert to yield power to have strength to overcome so to be i could say to be liberal to be legal if i can put in those kind of terms it doesn't avail anything there's no power to overcome there's no strength in it i mean to overcome the devil i mean there's no power i mean there's no power shown by extraordinary deeds there's no force amen there's no you know there's no strength in it so it's just empty right but a new birth is the thing that gives the strength i mean because we receive a new nature we receive a different we're a different kind of people we're not patched up i probably say this but i just we're going to repeat it we're not patched up you know it's not patches you know my dad used to work yo there in papua new guinea and and he used to manage a a coconut oil mill and over there you know it's not like here where you need a part you just go by the part and it turns up and you know you just go buy it they have to fabricate a lot of things and because the volcano is there and it's ashing and and it's and it's acidic when when when water goes on the ash then it eats away all the steel so a lot of that factory you can see it was literally patches on patches on patches trying to hold the thing up we're not like that we're not patches on patches on patches because the acidity of the devil no no we're new creations i mean that actually there's actually something built we become material that actually is not burnt up by the devil amen so we're not a patched up creation this is not a reformation this is a transformation i mean when the prophet preached god's power to transform he wasn't just saying a nice sermon title he was giving a declaration the spoken word has the power to transform the seed and then transform god's children i mean into what they should be into what's already within them to come forth hallelujah amen so circumcision or uncircumcision it doesn't avail anything but a new creature a new creation hallelujah hallelujah brother i'm says in the barman gilead you've got to be born again from above then you are new creatures in christ jesus and you're as abraham was you're his children you're seeking a city whose builder and maker is god that's why you act different that's why you see things different we see things different than the world do we not we see things very differently i mean we see in the scripture we're in the process of a rapture cycle the lord himself is descended with a shout the shout is the message a vindicated prophet told us i mean so we're in the process of the rapture cycle i mean so we see that we look at the world differently people maybe walk around heavy-hearted we don't have to be heavy-hearted we can be rejoicing even in a lockdown even when this world is gripped in the way it is we can rejoice and say glory amen the resurrection the life has come into me amen i become one with him amen i can't die no more than a god can die even if this body expires i'm still alive hallelujah and he's going to come and change this quick in this mortal body i mean the yeah you know the prophet emphasized a lot in the end of his ministry quickening power amen he said it you just searched that phrase in the message it's a lot in the end of his message the quickening power and he would preach about the true easter seal and you know he said that quickening power if the spirit that raised up jesus from the grave dwell in you he shall quicken your mortal bodies amen and that's why we are different kind of people will be made alive that's why we act different that's why we think different i mean because we have a way of escape i mean we don't we are not hopeless we are not helpless amen but god is here fighting our battles orchestrating all things preparing his people to leave this earth hallelujah amen that's why that's why you act different that's why you see things different you never get customized to this world we don't get adjusted and the more it becomes wicked the more shocked we should be we shouldn't just become used to it yeah there's a lot of new normals you can go decades you go back 100 years ago over 100 years now and you take fashion trends take social trends every decade there's a new normal you know we shouldn't be a customized to those things you know the world has already fallen apart you know it's already falling apart when the prophet preached the the the falling apart again of the world it wasn't kind of in an order but now it's fallen apart and all of us are actually born into a broken world and we think it's normal if we were 200 years old we could actually say no this is not normal society's broken everything's broken health care is broken the police system justice system is broken government's broken education's broken the whole world family's broken this world has fallen apart but we're alive in this world where it's falling apart you say well we've got a rally and we're going to rebuild the world brother braham said you can have an abraham lincoln or george washington and every county and every state in america wouldn't fix it amen so so if a vindicated prophet said that i'm not going to try because actually i've only got i'm very limited in my ability i can't multitask i want to be like the apostle paul i want to find all the all of the lord's children they get sealed into the kingdom then we can go home that's really you know hallelujah hallelujah amen you never get customized to this world because you're from above you act like the kingdom you belong in so i could say even right now how we act is reflecting a place we belong to right if we act like the world think like the world dressed like the world do like the world even in a religious way we're actually saying we're from this kingdom but i got good news ladies and gentlemen we don't have to stay belonging to this kingdom i mean there's a power of the blood of jesus christ that can transform a life i mean actually we don't reflect him um the earth or hell but we reflect heaven having to show actually we belong up in glory and even we actually all do belong up in glory god is not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance amen now as we have there as many as walk after this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god so what is that rule that is many walk in the power of the new creation of a people being born again after that rule now a rule uh it says here the definition i just had a good time in this because the apostle paul you know people you know you know the phrase i'm born again it's so diluted down that everyone's born again but it takes god to come and actually change in nature the things we once did we don't do no more not because we're told thou shall not he changes our desires he just reprograms us hallelujah and there's just nothing in you that wants it anymore amen so to be really born again amen he actually gives us a new nature and it's not something we just kind of walk into he just does it amen i believe in a you meet god one time you really meet him one time you give your all one time he'll transform your life you'll never be the same person you'll just become more like him from that day on amen so this word rule it means a definitely a bounded or fixed space within the limits of which one's power of influence is confined and it's this one's sphere of activity so this is what a rule is right so it's a sphere of activity so this is you could say it's a realm in which people live so if you're a son and daughter of god i just trust you're following this now you know if we're a son or daughter of god we're walking after a certain rule we're in a certain sphere and it's not the sphere of demons it's not the sphere of unbelief it's not the sphere of skepticism and it's not the sphere of just just being religious no it's a sphere of being a son or daughter of god being in joint a joint heir with jesus christ being seated in heavenly places in christ jesus now if you're living in that sphere i mean every devil must obey your voice right all of hell must obey what you say hallelujah nothing can stand before you amen isaiah would say that you know no weapon formed against thee shall prosper so that means there'll be weapons formed against me but they shall not prosper i mean if you're a son or daughter of god sure every gun of hell can be fully automatic at your face amen but it's not going to prosper against you but it's going to fall at your feet hallelujah the yeah yeah it's like david would say in psalms 27 and and maybe we'll just go there shall we let's go to psalms 27. this morning we're gonna you know if we can just realize who we are hallelujah the apostle paul knew who he was the prophet knew who he was amen if we could just realize what we are now now we are the sons and daughters of god right now hallelujah psalm 27 and verse one now this we know brother brown when he preached the rapture message he didn't go to first thessalonians four or first corinthians but he went here and he and to me he's speaking of this is the condition of the people that are in that actually enraptured condition this is the condition because actually it's not a you know to go on the rapture it's not am i am i mentally aware it's happening you know am i having a good day today am i feeling happy enough you know i love the two on the way to emmaus you know mondevins are made clear by prophecy luke 24 the two on the way to emmaus here are two believers now yeah the devil keeps saying you've said this before i'm going to say it again noah preached for 120 years didn't matter what angle he came out he ended up with the world is going to be flooded with water this arc is the only place of safety you better get in i don't know how many church services he had i don't know how many street meetings he had but didn't matter where he started that's where he ended right so he repeated himself a lot but his message was very important right so it's the same thing with you and i amen this message we have is vital but brother braham said that these modern events that you see right now are made clear by prophecy and that prophecy is luke chapter 24 and the condition of the believers there when the resurrection is going on they're not skipping they're not jumping they're not shouting they're not happy they're not even having an average day they're having a horrible day why because the one they believed would be the messiah had been crucified right as the third day that he's been in the grave you know the ministry had had had locked themselves away in the upper room the church treasurer had committed suicide it just had all fallen apart and so here they were broken-hearted walking on the way to emmaus they don't realize that paradise has been emptied out they don't realize that satan doesn't have the keys to his own house anymore they don't realize you know that the king of glory has conquered hell death in the grave they have no they have no real eye yo they don't realize what's going on in another realm and they're walking along remember they're walking in a season of a resurrection and they're broken-hearted and then jesus walks with them but he doesn't reveal fully who he is and he starts at moses and he actually it's amazing because you know he actually asked them what's wrong why are you so sad and they're surprised what do you mean you don't know what's going on the whole city the whole nation really knew what was going on and and you know he says what things like he didn't know he was the center of it all he was the lord is the center of it all even today you know and he's walking with them even pretending like he doesn't know what's going on they begin to say oh fools just you know slow of heart to belief they started at moses and he opened the scripture to show them fulfilled prophecy in their day right and the purpose of that wasn't just to give them a sermon but the purpose of that was to show them they are part of that resurrection that's why it's so incredible and you can't buy it you can't earn it that when the word comes forth it burns in your heart it speaks to you hallelujah it does something that that no other words do what's that god is ministering to you i'm going to pour in myself into you i want you to realize where you are i mean you're not walking along this road broken-hearted and you don't understand i'm going to show you what's going on and he walked with them and he opened the scriptures concerning himself and then finally he you know then they come to their house and he's pretending like he's going to walk on and they said no come stay with us and then he sits down at the table now the head of the house breaks the bread so he sat down as the head of the house and he broke the bridge so he did something he did before he was crucified then their eyes came open that's the master they disappeared but then they ran back into jerusalem what was all that that was a prophecy right of modern events what is the main modern event that's going on is it covert is it the great reset or whatever's going you know no it's not is it is it afghanistan is it the horrors that are going around in the world no that's not the main event that's a lot of other things but the main event is god is preparing a people to go in a rapture right this is and and this is why i believe we're here today it's god's preparing us don't look down and broken hearted what you see with your five senses those disciples saw jesus die they saw him scored they saw him be mocked and you know they saw it they felt the emotion of the crowd and maybe the hatred that was poured out upon him they felt the grief they had when they saw it happen they saw him give his last breath and you know they the five senses declared he died and their minds were telling them all these different things you know that broken heart but the lord was walking with him to say look beyond what you see think beyond what you think hallelujah and then he breaks the bread he does something he did now i'm kind of and i feel like i'm standing in a shower it's a bit echoey up here you know and so and so it gets you know it comes to this place he breaks the bridge he does something before he did before he died his eye you know their eyes come open and the whole purpose of that is because they had to be in the upper room because that was part of the resurrection and that's why this message has become so alive in your soul is because god has been ministering to you actually you are part of this resurrection hallelujah because if you have been resurrected from death to life hallelujah then you're going to be then your body's going to be changed as well it's all part of the same process amen so that's the main event going on praise god he says here the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell there was a time in life where david or you could say a believer could say when the enemy when the wicked evil my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat of my flesh i stumbled and fell so when the devil came with his temptations i fell and stumbled at it right but those who are in rapture condition have overcoming power right i mean so when the wicked even my enemies he says who shall i be afraid he's the strength of my life what shall i be afraid of see the devil you know there's so much fear in the world it's almost like you have to be afraid of something no no the only one to be afraid of don't be afraid of that which can destroy the body the scripture says but fear him that can destroy the body and the soul in hell so we shouldn't be afraid right are you all with me we should don't be afraid you're going to realize fear is torment fear is from hell it has no part in you and i so you got to tell that thing to go you don't you don't have to put up with it i mean the host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me and this and this will i be confident one thing i have just i'm desired with the lord that i may seek after i may dwell in the house of of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret place of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock hallelujah so the secret of his tabernacle is is being baptized with the holy ghost the lord living in your soul you're actually sealed into the secret place and what's that rock he has set our feet upon the revelation of who he is hallelujah and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing i'll sing praises unto the lord hallelujah as the brother brown preaches the rapture message he takes that as his opening scripture so what is he saying this is the condition of the people that are ready are ready for the rapture ask the question are you ready have you really met him he transformed your life are you now living according to his word is his life as his word living out of us amen so now it's a sphere of activity as i say we're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus is the rule we walk after of of the new birth now brother owen says in god of this evil age he says and the entire word of god incomplete was headed up in a body called jesus christ and their god made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection now we are seated with him with the power and authority over every devil oh if we could only believe what god has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and you don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do amen so if we are really seated there we will use that power place of position of authority amen and cast the devil out hallelujah now this peace that would rule right so if we so if we walk as many as walk according to this rule what is that the power of the new birth amen peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god now this peace that will be upon us it is the messiah's peace he said my peace i give unto thee not as the world gives remember the devil wants to pull us out of this place to make us think actually we have no peace no we have peace but it's not like worldly peace because worldly peace you know they think it's just being far away from trouble in some tranquil spot and now it's peaceful that's not real peace that's just removing a trouble right but we can have peace in the storm i mean we can actually have peace that it doesn't matter what's going on in life we can just be settled amen amen is that bearing your head in the sand no because you know who's in charge this is not bearing head and saying kind of stuff no you can realize the devil's on your case but you got to realize the one who's in you is greater than that devil amen so that's the messiah's peace it says of christianity it is the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through christ and so fearing nothing from god and content with its earthly lot of whatsoever sort that is that's peace right so it's actually the state that the soul is assured of its salvation through christ who's that you've got peace and you're fearing nothing from god why because you know you have a father you've got a loving lord jesus that actually holds nothing against you because he took your judgment that down calvary amen hallelujah and you're free whom the son is set free is free from sin that means i mean shall be free indeed right and and is content with its earthly lot whatsoever sort that is so whatever state we find ourselves in we should be content amen so there's peace hallelujah brother brown would dramatize when the lord is taken up there in um acts chapter one after he spoken to his disciples he says and he and as he begins to speak i begin to see daylight come under his feet what's the matter god's showing his power he's raising up what is he he's justifying every law of gravitation he's being lifted up why is it he's the creator of gravitation and here he is he ascends on up till he gets up on high and he sets down quietly at the feet of the majesty on high glory to god there he is with all power and heavens and earth in his hands not even one little wave can move on the ocean without he permits it there's his power hallelujah and that power of that same thing working in us to make us new creatures in christ jesus oh brother that's where the power comes as our faith brings down our faith which is love it casts away all fear amen that we think god can't keep his word but when i saw the very love and grace is is christ and it brings him right down to us that mighty power of god begins to work into the church love that conquers i'll tell you love is the most important thing there is in the world there's nothing that will take its place is love i mean so there's not one wave that can move without his permission hallelujah he's in control of everything amen and that same powers and now you and i are working in us hallelujah now the israel of god is a strange term i trust you don't mind this kind of a study but you know the apostle paul makes a phrase but there's so much in it right you could spend brother bam says like one scripture you said in months on it not even touch the sides but but but the israel of god now the israel of god we know it's not just the natural israel but it's the spiritual israel of of the believers who are birthed into the kingdom right because we are the spiritual israel amen justice is a natural israel and they'll have their day of grace after we've gone i mean we know they'll have three and a half years where the lord will will reveal himself there you know through through the two witnesses we know those things but you know the israel of god the word israel is actually from the word uh juriel which means he will rule as god amen and so now if there's an israel of god which is actually means that he will rule as god now how is that ever going to take place unless god comes and dwells in you and i i mean so god remember he has the final say in everything he has the final say nothing can get past him everything must ask his permission he has total dominion he has total power he doesn't have to negotiate you know this great contest between god and satan it's not a chess game the devil may think it's a chess game if i move here then he'll move here i'll take him here and i i do this i'll fake moving here then i'll you know it's like it's not a strategy in that way to god god decrees his word and then he makes it come to pass the devil thinks it's a chess game well you know if i get the believers to do this and then they'll do this and i'll get them to do this and they'll fail here and do this and you know that's not how god works god has decreed something he's spoken his word forth and nothing will stop it coming to place coming into manifestation hallelujah amy why because he he is god he's the lord god almighty so now if we are the israel of god that we will rule as god what will we have dominion over satan all of hell unbelief even this even the elements that make up this body i mean all those things will come subject i mean why because we have a dominion hallelujah amen now do you know a person who's really been born again is a miracle we you become a walking miracle right some people say the days of miracles have passed no because no no they can't be because i've seen people that have been really actually received a whole new nature they've actually become they may be living in the same house but they're totally different people seeing god literally transform a soul i mean that's a miracle and that's the greatest miracle that there is because that's an eternal miracle amen someone who gets healed of sickness they can get sick again even those who are raised from the dead they die again right but but a soul that's sealed away in christ be made a new creature that is the greatest miracle now that does not mean we we we we don't believe for healing i believe in divine healing why because jesus purchased on calvary i believe in the resurrection of the dead why it was purchased that day on calvary i believe the devil being cast out why because the blood loses the devil from people's lives so i believe in all those things i believe in prophecy speaking in tongues gifts are discernment all those things all that's in the word so it's for me right why on earth would i take a blessing cut it in half and say i don't want this i i want the whole thing amen whoever got a christmas present or a birthday present that i really wanted and just keep half of it i've never seen anyone like that i keep the whole thing even when i used to have lego when i was a kid it's actually still like have it you know i kept the box and everything hallelujah i didn't throw that away i got the instruction manual the box i got everything why because i want the whole blessing right same thing with the word just don't take part of it take the whole thing amen everything that god has given to us i want he says and you must be born again now what kind of a nature have you got then brother braham his nature if i had my father's nature then i'll do the things my father did but now that i'm born again it depends on who my father was if you're just born in the church you've got a church father you can call him father if you want to you can call him anything you want to because he's your father but if your father is god and you're born in the family of god you seek those things that pertain to god that's what the apostle paul did amen that's right then you are god's child your nature is god's nature then when some o hear them say some say oh our church believes that days and miracles has passed how could you believe the days of miracles is past when the very nature of god is in you when he is altogether miracle his nature's miracle his habits miracle his whole being is miracle how can you be anything else but miracle your new birth is miracle your new life is miracle even your nature's a miracle how can you look back and say them things are dead is that right see you're a new creature a new creation sure hallelujah so how can we believe that all things are not possible because we are a miracle hallelujah amen amen hallelujah he says an abraham seed what are you scared about are you afraid to take his word for anything don't be afraid call the thing right i am an ear to this oh i know i don't deserve it we know we don't deserve it right but i'm an ear hallelujah i mean it's like if i had the richest just say if the richest guy in the world was my uncle and you know he dies and then i fall heir to some of his fortune did i earn it did i make it right did i have any part of any of it no but because i'm an heir to what he has given me it's mine right it's the same thing with the lord do we deserve it do we earn it right do we merit it in any way no but we're in his will right and he has bequeathed certain things to you and i hallelujah so do we deserve it no but i'm in here anyhow because i'm an ear i receive it amen that's it there you are because i'm an ear that's it we're an air of salvation we're heir of the holy spirit i'm an heir because jesus paid the price nothing i had to do i just fell into it amen i'm healed because i'm an ear to it my diseases are gone my affliction has gone why because i'm an heir to it oh perfect assurance jesus is mine i want a foretaste of glory divine heir of salvation purchase of god born of his spirit washing his blood that's our story hallelujah i'm an heir to it what about the salvation of my family do i deserve it no but i've fallen into it healing deliverance all those things we're falling into it hallelujah it's mine praise the lord so we should rejoice in those things do we deserve it no but we're in here amen if we're an error joint here with christ the scripture tells us amen so we're an heir to every promise this is walking after the rule of the power of the new birth right we're here to it now paul would say earlier in galatians he would take the um he would take the allegory he would say speaking of of of the child your hey guys child which is a child of the bondwoman and the child of sarah who is the child of the promise it say tell me what are ye that desire to be under the lord do you not hear the law for it's written that abraham had two sons the one by one bond made the other by a free woman this is in galatians 4 and 22 i just read verse 23 but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he that was of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants one from the from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and antareth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but he says here now but jerusalem which is above us free which is the mother of us all for it is a written rejoice thou baron that breaketh not i mean sorry that beareth not break forth and cry thou that travaileth night for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath a husband now we brethren as isaac was are children of promise but as then he that is born after the flesh persecuted him that is born after the spirit even so it is now so he's saying that we are the children of promise do you think about this a promise is something that's announced that's going to happen right if you promise something to someone you're announcing i'm going to do that at a certain time that i've promised this is going to happen right and if it's in your power to do it you do it but us being mere mortals you know sometimes we promise things got to take back the promise but god is not that way god when he promises something it happens now we would think of something like that as a prophecy right because if god says yeah you have a prophet says thus saith the lord this and this and this and this will happen he's saying that in a future event this is going to happen it's god speaking right and it happens uh this may be very you say this is very elementary no no this did wonders to me maybe i'm just real simple but now he but the apostle paul saying that just as isaac was we are the children of promise hallelujah so god promised um abraham you're gonna have a promise son it's going to come now we are the children of promise as in we are the children of prophecy and what i mean is now prophecy is first announced but then god fulfills it and then it becomes history right prophecy becomes history when it's fulfilled so now god said in his word that he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle wash in the blood of the lamb amen it says in your revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready to her would be granted she be to raid in fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints right as a prophecy i remember this people when god spoke it forth amen there's a people that are there to fulfill that prophecy so you could say they are the people of promise of that promise now here we are we are the people of promise we're the children of promise uh i hope this is making sense it made sense to me maybe it was too late last night so you know but yeah it made sense to me we're we're actually a people of promise god actually said i'm gonna have a bride she's gonna be made in my image made out of the word the same material as i am as i am a lamb she will be a lamb she'll be meek and lowly and gentle and sweet and kind and have a have a lamb kind of nature hallelujah she'll be made in my image when i look at her i'll see me in feminine form hallelujah this was his promise and when god gives a promise satan can't do nothing to stop it he'll try and hinder it sure he did i mean because you know sarah couldn't have the child they'll think rebecca couldn't have a child isaac had to actually seek the lord for her to have a child yeah and you know the seat has always tried to be stopped that's naturally now but you see nothing could stop it happening that was hindered so now in the spiritual the devil can fight you but it's not going to stop if you're a child of promise i mean i'm actually being birthed into the kingdom because why i am the fulfillment of a promise that god has given that he's going to have a bride made in his image without spot or wrinkle that means the devil can fight you amen but god is there to fulfill his word in your life hallelujah and that's why people rejoice in the scripture when they see the word fulfilled amen the part of the reason why in in the upper room after the holy ghost came they acted like drunk people i mean it's because they were rejoicing they're actually staggering under the impact of this is the fulfillment of prophecy and it's not just on some kind of national level this is happening in me hallelujah when joel said i'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh i'm i'm part of that the handmaids and the young men will prophesy dream dreams different things they're actually staggering under the fact that now actually god was dwelling in me i mean what was just on the scrolls that was a promise was now fulfilled and that's why peter could stand and say they're not drunk with new wine but this is that spoken by the prophet joel what do you see right here is a fulfillment of prophecy and now it's becoming history hallelujah and that's why we can i trust you gotta stagger a bit when you think about what god has done in your life hallelujah where he took you from wherever you were you may be born on a message pew raised up but you know or come out of the world but there came a day where a spark ignited and when god made his word come alive and you and you begin to realize i am a fulfillment how they're because of god's doing i am a fulfillment of prophecy and nothing can stop it happening hallelujah amen when we look into revelations 12 and i'm going to kind of wind up with just these two thoughts here revelations 12 where it says that the you know that that great dragon was cast out that old serpent is cast out of heaven called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world this is verse 9 of revelations 12. he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him hallelujah by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they loved their love not their lives unto the death so there was a people god actually promised it there'll be a people that overcome the devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony hallelujah says the people that because of the blood of the lamb amen they're being washed away new creatures they had no sin held against them whatsoever amen the the old account was settled long ago hallelujah and by the word of their testimony what's their testimony it's what god has done in their lives really our testimonies are not ours it's actually a testimony of god that's what god did it's not what we do is what god does hallelujah what are they also testifying god's word is right his promises are true amen he's more than able and so god promised it but down through the ages and here we are even now we're a fulfillment of the scripture why because we're the children of promise hallelujah hallelujah now i just finished with this here in revelations 9 see we're going to realize that we're not alone in this battle we're not alone in this battle there's far more in this room than just you and i here with our distancing things you know there's angels gathered hallelujah if really if they were material like like our kind of material come we'd have to go meet on the field over there we'd have to have a big open air we need a real big place why because angels of god gather holy we're actually surrounded by a cloud of witnesses cheering us on in another realm you can do it we did it you can do it oh yeah we did it by the blood lamb what about testimony we overcame in our age but now you've got to overcome in your age i mean you've got to finish this lap you've got to finish this race we're waiting for you to finish oh we're here for a purpose amen we're not here just to occupy time we're not here to occupy time we're here to manifest the word of god hallelujah amen so now satan in revelations 9 it says and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit now we won't read the rest of the of the chapter but it speaks about hell coming open and a hundred thousand thousand demons loose from the river euphrates and you just look back from 100 years from now till now we can see that hell's empties itself upon the earth i mean between the first and second world first world war second world war hell came open but i want you to notice that this star fell he did not choose to come down like if someone's climbing a tree and they fall they don't choose to fall they fall right either their grip becomes loose or someone pushes them something happens that's outside their control and they fall who's experienced that yeah i trust your tree climbers when you're young right but but you fall because something happens that's outside your control so now this star that falls we know this is satan right but he is he falls he doesn't choose to come down an open hell upon the earth he's pushed he's cast out hallelujah but then now when after after john sees this happen it's not just now hell is here upon the earth and now we're helpless because god don't work that way because as he saw health come open these things happen then the first word of revelation is 10 is and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven so as satan fell right now god himself has come down upon the earth because this is christ in angelic form he comes down he doesn't fall he's not pushed he doesn't come down because something's outside his control no he chooses i'm going to step down upon the earth i'm going to anoint my people i mean to overcome all the forces of hell i'm gonna walk in them hallelujah his feet were his pillars of fire where are those pillars of fire there and you and i i mean we are the part of the body of christ upon the earth hallelujah so the devil fell but the lord themself came down in angelic form why to fight this battle for you and i we're not alone in this fight friends amen but we've got to realize we've got to walk after the rule of being of the new creation not after i do this or i don't do that no no no it's not those things don't avail it's being a new creature in jesus christ because if you are truly a new creature in jesus christ you will fulfill the word you will live it right it's not in your own strength keeping it there's a life of nature in you that fulfills it amen i think we'll just leave it there but you're glad aren't you glad that wait let's just go here sir sorry slides are dangerous things it says in first john 3 behold what manner of love that the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purify himself even as he is pure so now the prophet tells us the lord is actually appearing among us now his spirit is appearing among the church right and when we see him as he is in this way what does it do it causes us it says we shall be like him when we see him as he is we're actually seeing him appear among us who believes that the spirit of god moving that's him appearing there's difference between an appearing and a coming we know that right but every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure well how do we purify ourselves what to me that means we lay aside every weight and sin that so easily besets us and let us run this race that is set before us so it's actually exactly where you see this the lord's appearing among us hallelujah see everyone who has this now this hope is actually it's a expectation with pleasure you see when he is appearing actually realize actually we're in the cycle the process of the coming of the lord the rapture cycle so so everyone who has that hope within them they say i'm going to get rid of these these weights i'm going to lay aside this sin i want to run this race we're right at the end this is exciting hallelujah amen this is how we should be he says and ashamed over at the end time glorious hour the appearing of of the lord jesus he said there shall be earthquakes and divers places perplex of time distress between nations men's hearts failing and fear said when these things begin to happen raise up your head your redemption is drawing nigh so that's the most important thing all these things must needs be this is end time conditions but lift up your head knowing your redemption draws nigh amen who wants just live for the lord this is this is the hour lord might be a living witness may you live through me manifest your glory may i be salty to everyone i come in contact with may not get caught up in whatever is trending in the world now the world's been crucified to me it doesn't affect me anymore hallelujah
