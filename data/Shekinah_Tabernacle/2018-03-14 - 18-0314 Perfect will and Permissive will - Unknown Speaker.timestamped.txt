[27:05] time in your presence good to hear your
[27:07] voice and to realize over time Lord that
[27:12] that was really the main purpose of you
[27:14] coming down in doing all that you did
[27:17] for us paying the price of our salvation
[27:19] dying on the cross making this great
[27:22] plan this great plan of redemption Lord
[27:25] and then we see that the whole purpose
[27:27] was Lord so that you could just come
[27:28] down to the garden and fellowship with
[27:30] us again Lord so we just thank you Lord
[27:33] that we can come and fellowship with you
[27:34] this evening Lord and that that we
[27:38] always gain when we meet with you your
[27:41] the fountain of wisdom or knowledge of
[27:45] all life and more than that Lord about
[27:48] you with a new Lord lays love and joy
[27:51] not an understandable love but love
[27:54] itself not an understandable joy about
[27:57] joy yourself something Lord unfathomable
[28:00] peace that passes all understanding
[28:02] we thank you Lord that we can meet the
[28:04] Living God and be influenced by their
[28:07] Lord be up fluence by your spirit to
[28:09] become like you lord
[28:11] so just pray your blessing one here
[28:13] bless them all in their walk with you as
[28:16] they meet with you Lord may they press
[28:18] on and have that genuine fellowship with
[28:21] you Lord that's life-changing and that
[28:23] you came down to die for us that we
[28:26] could have we could be back there so we
[28:28] just want to commit this nights you and
[28:29] just thank you for your grace and mercy
[28:30] towards us Lord in Jesus name Amen
[28:32] praise the Lord God bless you can take
[28:34] your seats
[28:35] and this evening my guitar string broke
[28:39] no no there was only one I was sort of
[28:41] in the middle of her I was in that
[28:43] awkward zone between a guitar and a
[28:45] ukulele
[28:47] kind of like being left handed you know
[28:50] who's left-handed here are you I gotta
[28:54] take that back hey I've got um haven't
[29:00] you my children left handed one to
[29:03] anyone else don't we have three maybe
[29:06] three me over fifty Percy pray for me no
[29:15] so I just ask you to sit down because
[29:18] the the reading I've got is actually
[29:22] three chapters long but I'm not going to
[29:25] read the whole three chapters so I'm
[29:26] just going to paraphrase these a story
[29:29] and you know I'll let you know what what
[29:30] it's about after that but I'm if you got
[29:34] that is they kind of work I haven't done
[29:38] it's from um we're on judges 19 but you
[29:45] I think this is a reasonably well known
[29:48] story so you will know the story as we
[29:51] go into it
[30:03] is this thing gonna cooperate or is it
[30:06] gonna be like a catastrophe you go well
[30:07] is that you brother out amount or does
[30:09] that mean okay can you do that and try
[30:12] and get this going well that's hitting
[30:18] now I've got to move quick into this
[30:21] because Wednesday nights are supposed to
[30:22] be assuming it you know not just sermon
[30:25] and hum Enya this became more like a sim
[30:32] and so I've got a rush through it to get
[30:33] through it because I have to get to the
[30:34] end of it because that's that's the I'm
[30:39] not going to tell you anything you don't
[30:40] know though you know what I'm like I'm
[30:42] not that smart I just sort of repeat
[30:44] stories in it and put them all together
[30:46] but I don't know you won't hear anything
[30:48] that I did before so the story is about
[30:51] there was a there was a man and the
[30:53] Bible says he was a Levite this is in
[30:55] the time of Judges
[30:56] and the Bible says that he sojourned
[31:04] sojourned on the hill country and
[31:06] Ephraim which is here and he had a
[31:09] concubine and his concubine weaned off
[31:14] and left him and did things and then she
[31:17] after that has which it was his wife
[31:19] went back to Bethlehem which is down
[31:23] here so he leaves this man but this man
[31:25] is a he's a nice person he's a forgiving
[31:29] man and one day he thinks I'll go back
[31:31] and I'm gonna go and see my wife and I
[31:32] want to bring her back to me so he would
[31:34] have been a nice man and so he walks
[31:36] from him and as his servant and as we
[31:40] went with and he walks from there all
[31:42] the way down to Bethlehem and the
[31:44] father-in-law and the wife very happy to
[31:46] see see him so they welcomed him in and
[31:48] his father puts on a feast that night
[31:50] and they have the feast and he's gonna
[31:52] he says well have the feast tonight and
[31:53] then he says I'll leave the next day and
[31:55] go back to be him the next day comes and
[31:59] they wake up and he wants to go and the
[32:00] father Norse is no stay another day stay
[32:02] heaven it will prepare another feast
[32:04] tonight you can stay so he says okay
[32:06] I'll stay another night so here's
[32:09] another feast that night and I think he
[32:11] had another feast the next day see I'll
[32:12] go today and he said as father nor sit
[32:14] no stay another day maybe because in
[32:16] those they
[32:17] when the maybe the daughter leaves yeah
[32:19] and you don't travel that far it's not
[32:21] gonna see them for a long time no
[32:22] Facebook no Instagram but I believe he
[32:25] actually enjoyed this men's company he
[32:26] was probably a nice man and so the third
[32:30] day he stayed another night and then the
[32:32] next day he said look I have to go today
[32:34] he sort of tarried along and you know
[32:36] maybe lunchtime one or two o'clock he
[32:38] said no look we've got to carry on I've
[32:39] got to get back so so he starts walking
[32:42] back now because he left in the evening
[32:44] from Bethlehem which is down here he
[32:47] lived from me to him four five six
[32:51] o'clock an hour or twos walk three three
[32:53] hours walk it's starting to get dark and
[32:55] they come to a place called gibbous
[32:56] which is modern-day Jerusalem but back
[33:00] then it was Jebus because the Jebusites
[33:01] were there and his servant says look
[33:03] here we're at the city why don't we go
[33:05] on and lodge here for the night and the
[33:07] Levite says no I don't want to go on
[33:10] lodging in a city of these heathens I
[33:13] want to go to our people to the children
[33:15] of Israel we'll go into one of these
[33:16] cities Sosa's we'll carry on and we'll
[33:18] go to Gibeah which is maybe another few
[33:21] hours up the road so they they travel on
[33:23] up to give you I just put this so you
[33:25] can see an idea of we these places are
[33:27] and they get here and they go way down
[33:29] on the street and then an old man comes
[33:31] along and he's coming from the fields
[33:33] maybe he worked an hour or so out and
[33:35] he's walked back and he sees this family
[33:38] and their servant and he says them come
[33:40] and come and lodge at my place so so for
[33:44] us working out for this man and they go
[33:47] into his house and lodge but then the
[33:49] Bible says there are these wicked men in
[33:51] the city back that actually come to the
[33:53] house and say similar to what happened
[33:55] in Lots time who are the men that came
[33:58] here they said who was in their sin
[34:00] demand out to us send them out and these
[34:02] were the Boyle calls him men of Belial
[34:05] is he's just wicked men but they were
[34:08] Israelites this was not the sort of
[34:09] thing this man was expecting to
[34:10] encounter and and there's been an and
[34:12] the City of Benjamin because that's
[34:14] where they were and and they're also got
[34:19] quite violent and I don't know how they
[34:20] worked in those days but in the end that
[34:21] the man says look I'll I've seen you out
[34:23] my concubine my wife what she just walk
[34:25] all the way to get the seat here up and
[34:28] the night happened
[34:30] and in the morning they so they're over
[34:37] there the pictures for the children
[34:38] that's the father-in-law and then in the
[34:41] morning they come outside and his
[34:43] concubine is laying on the steps of the
[34:45] house and he goes to wake her up and
[34:47] finds out that she's dead so these men
[34:51] had did what they did during the night
[34:53] and and killed his wife and I won't say
[35:01] it was a way that he made leave all
[35:02] those rail know what happened because he
[35:03] was understandably upset by the
[35:07] situation so he he he did an act and let
[35:10] all of the people of Israel know this is
[35:12] what the children of Benjamin have done
[35:14] to me in the city okay now we're in the
[35:18] whole country because they did find out
[35:19] about it because they all received a
[35:23] little piece of here when the hog and
[35:25] then they were disgusted by what
[35:27] happened they they said okay we're all
[35:32] going to gather together and deal with
[35:33] us they what they were horrified so they
[35:35] all they all meet the Bible says they
[35:37] all meet and Mizpah which you can see
[35:40] most powers up here so they all meet
[35:42] here the whole of us were all gather
[35:44] around and the Bible says that there are
[35:46] four hundred thousand footmen so 400,000
[35:49] soldiers that come so every able man of
[35:51] Israel they said everyone come here
[35:53] we're going to deal with us this was
[35:55] turned this is turning out to be a very
[35:56] big deal and here's the man the man
[35:58] tells them this is what happened when I
[35:59] went to the city of Benjamin this is how
[36:01] it worked now the one will say so the
[36:07] Miniver swear I will get it together
[36:08] against the city knit together as one
[36:10] man and they went down to the city and
[36:12] they said bring out the men that did
[36:13] this thing and the people of the city
[36:15] said no we won't we won't let them out
[36:18] and then so the children they they they
[36:21] went back to Mizpah and then it says the
[36:23] children of Israel arose and went up to
[36:26] the house of God and asked counsel of
[36:27] God and see which of us shall go first
[36:29] to the battle against the children of
[36:30] Benjamin and the Lord said Judas shall
[36:32] go first so see it's in Judah down first
[36:35] so Judah goes out to battle the Knicks
[36:37] there against the city of the Benjamin
[36:38] Heights and they were beaten that Judah
[36:42] was beaten then they lost
[36:44] 22,000 men that day and they retreat
[36:48] then the next day they gather themselves
[36:52] back to where they started the battle
[36:53] and they encourage themselves in the
[36:55] Lord the Bible says and they do a bit of
[36:57] a weep and a fast during that day and
[36:59] then they say to the Lord again Shelby
[37:02] you're going go up to battle against
[37:04] Benjamin and the Lord said go up so they
[37:06] went up the next day and then the next
[37:08] day they went again and they lost 18,000
[37:13] men and they lost the battle again so
[37:15] the second battle they've lost then they
[37:18] come back to the Lord and they say Lord
[37:19] what should we do you know they inquire
[37:22] again at the Lord and the Bible says
[37:23] that the Ark of the Covenant was with
[37:26] him in those days and Aaron and this is
[37:28] shallow yet go to battle to battle
[37:30] against the children of Benjamin my
[37:31] brother or shall I cease and the Lord
[37:33] said go up for tomorrow I'll deliver
[37:34] them into your hand so the next day they
[37:36] go up to the city and what they do is
[37:38] they they they have this plan they think
[37:42] we'll all sort of wait like this we'll
[37:43] wait around they're hiding away some men
[37:45] can come up and then you can act like
[37:47] you're being beaten and run off and then
[37:49] the children of Benjamin will get
[37:50] confident think I will defeat them like
[37:52] we did on the first two battles and
[37:53] they'll run out after you and then we'll
[37:55] we'll do it at an ambush and we'll you
[37:57] know burn the city then we'll come and
[37:59] destroy them so there was their plan
[38:00] that third day and it worked they
[38:04] defeated the city the children of
[38:06] Benjamin fell for their trap
[38:08] and then after that they went through
[38:11] all the land of Benjamin to every city
[38:13] and they raised it to the ground they
[38:15] slew everyone in the city and burnt the
[38:18] cities they went from everywhere and
[38:21] they destroyed basically Benjamin and
[38:27] 600 men of Benjamin escaped and they ran
[38:30] up to the hills to the rock ramon which
[38:32] is here the rock ramon 600 men escaped
[38:35] but the rest of benjamin they wiped out
[38:39] City after City after city and then when
[38:44] all the slaughter had vanished I guess
[38:46] they were calmed down a bit and then
[38:47] they looked at the situation and they
[38:50] thought Lord houses come upon us that
[38:52] we've actually almost wiped out an
[38:53] entire tribe of one of one of a whole
[38:56] tribe
[38:58] they said Oh Lord God of Israel why is
[39:00] this come to pass Sinestro that there
[39:01] should be today one tribe lacking in
[39:03] Israel because here only 600 men left so
[39:06] they knew that they were up there and
[39:08] then they thought well we've got to fix
[39:10] up the situation somehow so they they
[39:12] said well who didn't come with us to the
[39:13] battle who didn't come and they said
[39:16] well there was a tribe from Jobi Gilead
[39:20] the tribe but they were a group that
[39:23] said he didn't come down to us in the
[39:24] battle so this is what we're going to do
[39:26] we're going to go to that city and we're
[39:28] going to kill all of him and we're going
[39:30] to take anyone that's a this is nasty
[39:32] we're gonna take you to it they're
[39:34] virgins and we're gonna bring them take
[39:37] them we're going to give them to these
[39:38] children of Benjamin's so that Benjamin
[39:40] carry on I need to say here too
[39:42] when they went to Mizpah they made an
[39:45] oath they said none of us will give our
[39:47] daughters that the children of Benjamin
[39:48] ever so all the men made an oath we will
[39:50] not give them our children our daughters
[39:52] so they weren't going to get any but see
[39:57] because those men of that city weren't
[39:59] there they didn't make that oath so they
[40:00] slew them all and took those two orders
[40:02] and gave them possess they put all this
[40:03] is not breaking our oath they didn't
[40:04] they didn't come to the gathering right
[40:06] and it wasn't enough they brought 400
[40:09] and they came to the children Benjamin
[40:12] which were in the rock Ramon you and
[40:13] they said here take these 400 but it
[40:16] wasn't enough they needed another 200
[40:17] because there were 600 men so then they
[40:20] said okay they said every year there's a
[40:24] feast and Shiloh here we gather together
[40:26] for a feast then and then the young
[40:28] maidens now they go to the vineyards and
[40:30] dance and things they said what you mean
[40:32] or if Benjamin can do is you can come
[40:34] down and hide in the vineyards and when
[40:36] you see a woman in the vineyard you can
[40:37] go on kidnap here and grab here and take
[40:41] her away back up to where you are this
[40:44] is crazy
[40:46] it's crazy you can take them and they
[40:49] said when the father or the Brethren
[40:51] come to us to say this is what the
[40:53] children have Benjamin did you can say
[40:55] we'll tell them look it's for a good
[40:57] cause and and even though you gave one
[41:00] of your daughters to the children of
[41:01] Benjamin and you've meant oh that you
[41:02] wouldn't you did not give the your
[41:04] daughter your daughter was stolen from
[41:06] you so you'll be free from the oath that
[41:08] you made that be okay and so the first
[41:11] year they went and kidnapped 200 woman
[41:14] and went up and then the tribe of
[41:16] Benjamin carried on I finished reading
[41:20] this story and I thought man what a what
[41:24] a what a very interesting story and it
[41:31] didn't make any sense to me that the
[41:33] whole situation
[41:34] I had another sermon what I thought was
[41:39] a bigger one that I was going to do and
[41:41] it was actually it was about um you know
[41:45] in the olden days of the mean would sail
[41:47] around the world they would leave
[41:49] animals like pigs on certain islands and
[41:51] then carry on because they would say if
[41:52] another boat comes in and they get
[41:54] shipwrecked Lee or anything they can
[41:55] Headly a fine wildlife on this island
[41:58] these islands so some of these some of
[42:01] these strands of animals like pigs and
[42:02] things they were from the early english
[42:04] days and they will get released on an
[42:06] island and then they would stay there
[42:07] for sometimes 100-200 years yeah and as
[42:10] time progressed people found these pigs
[42:11] in them they realized well these are
[42:13] gonna be good for modern medical use
[42:15] because here were these pigs on the soil
[42:17] net but untainted they had no no disease
[42:19] and they could they actually started
[42:20] using these pigs for medical research
[42:22] and for making a lot of things so they
[42:23] were because all the pigs on the
[42:25] mainland were all tainted and I was
[42:26] going to type that with the Word of God
[42:27] being kidding the way and coming back
[42:28] but but this came up now I'm not going
[42:34] to say this is what the story's about
[42:35] but the what I want to speak about today
[42:36] as a as the pit tonight is the perfect
[42:38] will and the promise of will of God but
[42:41] I'm going to go through a few other
[42:42] stories any more cut back to that one at
[42:43] the end and you'll know these stories
[42:45] but your interest thing to just think
[42:47] about think about they're interesting do
[42:52] you think about because it's it's it's
[42:54] been very interesting for me
[42:56] I'm gonna start with one you know but
[42:58] I've had a great time looking into this
[42:59] and understanding the dynamics of a
[43:01] especially since I know more South
[43:02] Africans in but more about the country
[43:04] this is um Florence Nightingale the lead
[43:09] Florence Nightingale and her story is
[43:13] that she was a it wasn't really a nurse
[43:16] because they didn't hypnosis when she
[43:18] was nursing but she went to the war and
[43:21] Crimea like 1850 I think it was around
[43:24] that period and she took some other
[43:26] people with her and the way that the
[43:30] hospitals would operate in those days
[43:31] was you know the doctor min would come
[43:33] out and look after the guys at night and
[43:34] then five o'clock sign out you know see
[43:37] you guys will be back in the morning and
[43:39] go home and do what they're doing come
[43:41] back in the morning and see who's still
[43:43] alive basically you know but this this
[43:47] lady here thought well that's not really
[43:49] working we've got to stay with these
[43:50] guys and look after them and in you know
[43:53] at night they need people as well so she
[43:55] would she would go around with your lamp
[43:57] all night and have heavy who the lady
[44:00] she brought with him just looking after
[44:01] these men all through the night and she
[44:03] got the nickname or the church she got
[44:04] named the lady with the lamp I think
[44:06] they were one of the London newspapers
[44:07] called you the lady with the lamp and
[44:09] there was a poem written about here from
[44:11] no brother branham was one of his
[44:13] favorite problems was the lives of great
[44:16] men all remind us we can make our lives
[44:17] sublime so there was Henry longfellow so
[44:20] he also wrote a poem about about
[44:23] Florence Nightingale now he was in
[44:25] America she was in Grand Europe so her
[44:27] fame must have spread abroad you know
[44:29] over to even and this was only a few
[44:31] years afterwards he wrote this poem so
[44:32] she was quite well known
[44:34] he says lo in that house of misery a
[44:37] lady with the lamp I see passed through
[44:39] the glimmering gloom and flipped from
[44:41] room to room I'm talking about what she
[44:43] would do to help the soldiers now there
[44:47] was another Florence Nightingale brother
[44:49] Brown sees here that she's the
[44:50] great-granddaughter of Florence
[44:52] Nightingale when it comes to these sort
[44:55] of things he's not - doesn't he doesn't
[44:56] really bore himself with the meticulous
[44:58] details of situations I've learnt in my
[45:00] research of it he when it comes to the
[45:02] Word of God he does but when it comes to
[45:03] just you know he might say it was a week
[45:06] ago and it was two years ago he's like
[45:08] that's beside the point that was
[45:09] and the time period before bus you know
[45:11] so so he says here that you know this
[45:14] was florence Nightingale's
[45:15] great-granddaughter well she didn't have
[45:16] any children she was single of your
[45:18] whole life so but Florence Nightingale
[45:21] was a distant was a relative of Florence
[45:23] Nightingale but not it not of the direct
[45:26] lineage of not a great grandchild but
[45:28] it's it is what it is so I'll just read
[45:32] you this here so brother Bosworth one
[45:34] day brother Bosworth came showed me ask
[45:36] Ellen's picture see brother branham
[45:37] Florence Nightingale is calling from
[45:39] Durban South Africa come pray for her
[45:40] said she's great-great granddaughter or
[45:42] something whoever you know to Lake
[45:44] Florence Nightingale laughter over there
[45:46] and he said all these noble and those
[45:47] renounce and he said but you see brother
[45:51] bras worth with all these things going
[45:52] on I can't you know brother Bosworth I
[45:54] can't go the way things are now I can't
[45:56] do it let's just pray so they all kneel
[45:57] down and they they pray for this lady
[45:59] Florence I've just left a few things out
[46:01] there and and then he prays he says Lord
[46:04] I've always wanted to go to Africa so
[46:07] I'm gonna pray for Florence tonight
[46:09] we're gonna kneel down and pray and if
[46:10] she gets healed I'll take that as a sign
[46:11] that I go to Africa to South Africa and
[46:14] now notice she was from Durban so then
[46:16] and he lifted at that didn't hear
[46:18] anything of it I don't know how long
[46:21] this was maybe a year or two later
[46:23] whatever was King George of England had
[46:26] written letters to brother Branham and
[46:29] to his campaign and they'd heard about
[46:31] him and they requested that he come over
[46:33] to England and pray for him for King
[46:36] George and most of us when we get us
[46:38] from a king to come and pray we will
[46:39] probably jump on the next flight and go
[46:40] over there but he said look I'm over
[46:42] busy at the moment I'll just pray for
[46:43] you here and you'll be okay scintillator
[46:44] back and um and they seemed to lead it
[46:48] back saying no we would really like you
[46:49] to come over here and pray there to kind
[46:51] of persuade him to come he didn't care
[46:53] too much he wasn't he wasn't gonna
[46:56] doesn't didn't matter what social
[46:58] standing ahead and in his eyes it didn't
[46:59] matter what social standing you were it
[47:01] was about the state of your soul maybe
[47:02] they were people too as ministering to
[47:03] that hey this is my job here in that he
[47:06] wasn't a sellout so but eventually he
[47:09] said look we're going to we want to go
[47:10] to Europe anyway and do it do a trip
[47:12] around there so what we'll do then is
[47:14] we'll fly into England and then I'll go
[47:15] and pray for you and then we'll carry on
[47:16] around Europe so they fly to England and
[47:20] somehow
[47:21] Florence Nightingale
[47:23] from Durban South Africa finds out now
[47:25] she's English she's a missionary in
[47:26] Durban she finds out that brother
[47:29] Brennan was going to England and they
[47:30] don't know how it was but I I I'm
[47:32] guessing it was because of her family
[47:34] that she was an Ender you know she was a
[47:37] Christian family and I think also of a
[47:38] certain circles maybe the word got
[47:40] around in those circles that our brother
[47:42] Brown was going to come and pray for the
[47:43] king
[47:43] it was probably was nun with an circle
[47:45] so she may be hood it and maybe got hold
[47:48] of his itinerary when's he gonna come
[47:49] can you find it a science so that no
[47:50] stance there's no sign so to find out
[47:52] when he's going to apply and cuz she
[47:53] timed here sort of fly in to be everyone
[47:56] when he arrived so he's going to pray
[47:58] for the King of England and this lady
[47:59] Florence Nightingale turns up and and
[48:01] gets a message to them and they say look
[48:03] that lady Florence is here in England
[48:05] and they weren't you go and pray for her
[48:06] so they they go to her where she's
[48:10] staying
[48:10] somebody's house and and they pray and
[48:13] and then she gets with us saith the Lord
[48:17] or to their to pick that she's going to
[48:18] be okay so that was here before they
[48:20] prayed essentially of what she looked
[48:21] like she I forget the disease and then
[48:23] that's here it's before and after it's
[48:26] like our BC life in Christ you know
[48:29] we're skeleton of what we should be in
[48:30] afterwards we're full of life so that
[48:33] that's so that's what happened to hear
[48:35] so now he finds out that she's been
[48:37] healed because after a while she seen
[48:38] some this next picture this is me
[48:40] brother branham I'm completely healed so
[48:42] now he's made a promise to God if not a
[48:44] promise but he said if you here if
[48:45] you'll hear me I'll go to South Africa
[48:47] namely Dubin go fast so now he plans a
[48:52] trip to Durban not to do my sorry to
[48:54] South Africa and they they lined the
[48:55] strip out for him I think this is the
[48:57] first trip I think that's a quick photo
[48:59] now they fly into Johannesburg so and
[49:03] brother Branham says he's flew him for a
[49:05] few days and he was tired but he turns
[49:07] up and they have a meeting like the
[49:08] first day he's here they have a meeting
[49:10] and and the meeting is a as a success
[49:12] they're just people are healed souls are
[49:15] coming in things are happening here's
[49:18] one story if he just as soon as I got on
[49:21] this is to the service and Johannesburg
[49:24] I saw a vision just break before me and
[49:26] he came boy with one leg about six
[49:29] inches shorter than the other
[49:30] I've seen his lemon come down normally
[49:32] looked throughout to see where the boy
[49:32] was I've seen him sitting we hadn't had
[49:34] time to give out no prayer cards we
[49:35] couldn't call up
[49:36] Krillin why no not that kind of crowd
[49:38] and I see a young man Jesus has healed
[49:40] you you've come here from Durban and he
[49:42] has made you well stand up on your feet
[49:44] beers leave was perfectly well the
[49:46] headlines in the paper the boy the
[49:47] reporters Windham editors needs to see
[49:49] testified his father and mother there it
[49:50] was so saying this boy got healed and
[49:52] then the headlines were in the paper and
[49:54] this is the newspaper article here up
[49:57] this boy his name was um Ernest blue him
[50:02] this is an interesting read if you
[50:04] haven't read this if you read this last
[50:07] Sunday evening Ernest
[50:13] maybe I'll put on what's it so they took
[50:17] he gives a testimony says we heard about
[50:19] this man and this pastor in South Africa
[50:22] and America and we heard he was coming
[50:23] here so we drove up to Durban our to jet
[50:25] from Durban to Johannesburg that's what
[50:27] his parents are saying he says we were
[50:28] in the meeting and then Ernest says that
[50:31] the the pastor Brandon told us to lay
[50:33] hands on each other and pray so I did
[50:35] and someone laid hands on me and then he
[50:36] said I felt this weird sensation coming
[50:37] through me and then I thought I think
[50:40] I'm healed but he didn't know that and
[50:42] then he got asked to come on the
[50:43] platform and he said he walked around
[50:44] and he was healed and brother Adam arm
[50:47] will love this he said you know what I'm
[50:50] healed so well I'm even playing cricket
[50:51] now that was down the bottom here now I
[50:55] play cricket and other games say so now
[51:01] he's only been here a day and already
[51:03] he's done newspapers and they're
[51:05] testifying of what the Lord's done the
[51:08] next morning the Medical Association
[51:09] called up and said they wanted to have
[51:11] breakfast and wanted me to have
[51:14] breakfast with him and they gave me the
[51:15] right hand of fellowship I said that's
[51:17] true divine healing and we rappin their
[51:18] hospitals to anything that you want well
[51:21] you're here so the hospitals are saying
[51:24] the Medical Association says you can
[51:25] look we believe this comin do whatever
[51:29] you want it's yours that the city is
[51:32] yours
[51:32] and then and then the day after that a
[51:40] few days after that they're having
[51:41] meeting after meeting for a three or
[51:42] four days a couple of Afrikaans men
[51:45] ministers are at a house with brother
[51:49] Branham and one is disagreeing
[51:50] to find healing and the other one is
[51:51] agreeing with it and and the one that
[51:53] was agreeing with it and and was for
[51:55] brother branham he was getting so I'm
[51:59] not angry but he got to the point where
[52:04] he said to this other man here is out
[52:07] there visitation this is our day of
[52:09] visitation and your you're missing it
[52:11] you're just you're walking away from it
[52:13] he said I'm gonna go outside now and
[52:15] pray for your lost soul that's what he
[52:18] did and so he walked out of the house
[52:19] and walked out to the yard and started
[52:21] praying and this is his testimony he
[52:24] said when I was out here an angel came
[52:26] to me and laid his hand upon me to go
[52:28] back inside and tell him so he comes
[52:30] running back and he says look I was out
[52:32] there praying for you and an Angels need
[52:33] to come in and tell you you know that
[52:34] the name's will came and they said he
[52:36] the angel put his hand on my back it
[52:38] felt like it burnt my back and they
[52:40] looked on his back he was a bit
[52:42] handprint on his back okay the man
[52:47] couldn't how do you believe it and now
[52:48] they and and then that went into there I
[52:52] think the Johannesburg front page of the
[52:54] local of the city paper there that and
[52:57] they took a photo of this nation he got
[52:58] brother branham's hand in his hand foot
[52:59] perfectly on the print so now and this
[53:03] is now this is he's only been here a few
[53:05] days and he's in the newspapers the
[53:06] Medical Association are opening up the
[53:08] doors for them to come in and the Lord
[53:13] tells him the Lord says now this is what
[53:16] I want you to do brother Brennan I want
[53:17] you to stay in Johannesburg he says here
[53:21] and then they wanted me to leave this is
[53:24] very good story gets interesting he says
[53:28] so that night I remember when I went to
[53:30] pray the angels and all came down and he
[53:32] said to me don't go down there he said
[53:34] you stay right here in Johannesburg for
[53:36] two weeks and then you go over to
[53:37] brother Sydney Jackson's place which in
[53:39] mid-city Jackson before he didn't know
[53:40] the guy he said you go to his house go
[53:42] hunting after that go to Durban and wait
[53:45] there till I tell you what to do and
[53:46] you'll be in Durban you'll be here for
[53:49] about a month so the Lord said this is
[53:51] what I want you to do stay here for two
[53:52] weeks go hunting then go to Durban the
[53:57] the Afrikaans brothers that are
[53:58] organizing the trip had other plans they
[54:01] had planned a big long series of trips
[54:03] all
[54:03] essentially this direction like like
[54:05] because brother a dimensions clogs drop
[54:08] through room Fontaine Kimberley cake
[54:15] town and these here I just made up so
[54:17] this is just but it was a big circuit
[54:19] they planned on doing and they said no
[54:21] no sir brother MCS look brothers God
[54:23] told me this is what this is our
[54:24] itinerary and they said no no no no no
[54:28] that's not our itinerary this is our
[54:29] itinerary and that's where all the
[54:32] trouble began to start now the next day
[54:37] they were going from Johannesburg to
[54:38] Pretoria which I guess is two hours
[54:40] drive or one hour yeah sounds like they
[54:42] were doing a day trip up there and back
[54:44] you know so and he said look when we go
[54:47] up to Pretoria on this trip the Lord
[54:50] gave me a version to show you that what
[54:51] I'm telling you was the truth he said
[54:52] we're gonna see a man in purple was
[54:54] gonna be in purple which was probably a
[54:55] unique color beer we're gonna this is
[54:58] gonna be a robe where there's usually
[54:59] lots of sellers this time there's only
[55:01] gonna be one and you're gonna be quite
[55:02] surprised as just one seller of beads
[55:04] and things on this road and he said
[55:05] we're going to visit somebody that some
[55:07] that's almost sick but this person's not
[55:09] going to get here they're going to die
[55:09] but we're gonna go and pray for them and
[55:11] then brother Bosworth you said you're
[55:14] going to point out to me a peculiar bird
[55:15] so you're saying as we go to Pretoria
[55:18] we're going to see all these things
[55:19] happen so that you'll know what I told
[55:20] you that we shouldn't go down on this
[55:21] other route is the truth and so they
[55:23] went down they saw all these things and
[55:25] he pointed them out hard is the seller
[55:27] the is the man in purple is the bird but
[55:30] they insisted no no we've made plans and
[55:33] we've got to stick with the plans maybe
[55:35] you didn't hear from God brother branham
[55:38] would he flatly refused after all I said
[55:40] I'm not going God told me don't go no no
[55:43] no and he would say pull the car over
[55:45] I'm not going any further so they
[55:46] started going down to quick stroke yeah
[55:52] and it was on the way down
[55:59] if you understand the situation what was
[56:01] happening was brother bear him didn't
[56:02] have any money - he had no money these
[56:04] brothers are flying them here and they
[56:07] they were taking him around on the trip
[56:08] and he had no money and they had as a
[56:11] cherry and everything and annual of
[56:13] people so but he was telling brother
[56:15] Bosworth we've got to stay so you can
[56:16] understand the pressure so he really
[56:19] sought God one not and then God said
[56:22] look you know you're trapped in this now
[56:24] you've kind of got to go with them now
[56:25] it's just the way it's all worked out
[56:26] and everything he said but but you'll
[56:28] pay for it and he said to them look God
[56:32] told me last night that we can carry on
[56:34] on the circuit but it's going to be in
[56:35] this permissive whirling we're going to
[56:36] pay for this for doing this owners
[56:38] permissive will we're going to pay for
[56:39] it and he told them that you know it's
[56:41] going to be a fine day today he said
[56:44] we're going to pick up a boy in a car in
[56:45] a suit and boy where you get you'll see
[56:46] him in the car we're gonna see a native
[56:48] with a stick suit about to strike
[56:50] another man in his certain place and
[56:51] they saw all these things and he said
[56:52] see I told you now we're gonna be in
[56:54] this permissive world and he said and
[56:59] brother Bosworth as a witness of God the
[57:01] very next meeting all hell broke loose
[57:03] is that right trouble sittin and it was
[57:06] that way till we got plum to Durban so
[57:08] God still moves but the first meeting
[57:10] they're heading clerks throught the
[57:12] first night hurricane blew through and
[57:15] they then it just carried on and carried
[57:16] on through they had to cancel the
[57:17] meeting
[57:18] the second nighter was bitterly cold I
[57:20] couldn't it was just so cold and brother
[57:21] Brown said look third night there be an
[57:23] earthquake this is we're outside the
[57:24] will of God so they carried on they went
[57:28] to another just to give you examples of
[57:29] what was happening they went to
[57:31] Kimberley there was a church there that
[57:33] held four hundred people and the Africa
[57:35] and some of it you can understand he's
[57:37] stubborn Afrikaans people unconverted
[57:39] this man this old man seated brother in
[57:41] his seat he was a nice man but he said
[57:42] no we're having the meeting in my church
[57:44] and that's it and Mike judge let's
[57:47] church but four hundred people and there
[57:48] were twelve thousand wanting to go to
[57:49] the meeting he said we're having it here
[57:51] that's a and brother Graham said look
[57:53] we're doing all this we could have been
[57:54] in Johannesburg there were beds there
[57:56] were rooms everyone could have come from
[57:57] the whole country and just we could have
[57:59] had meetings here for two weeks the word
[58:00] will get out they could come they could
[58:01] stay we could have big auditoriums but
[58:05] they did this instead and then they all
[58:08] got suck all of brother programs did all
[58:10] of his people got sick and
[58:12] the effort Afrikaans men got sick as
[58:15] well and so they carried on these
[58:17] meetings the Lord moves the Lord healed
[58:18] people the Lord did things and I venture
[58:20] to say there are still there would be
[58:22] people in South Africa today that were
[58:24] it came in through this you know there
[58:26] would be and things happen because this
[58:29] God still moved yeah and he says they
[58:34] were got sick on this journey around
[58:36] here then they got to do and then
[58:38] brother Graham didn't know this but he
[58:40] found out later that Durban was the only
[58:41] place that they didn't have segregation
[58:43] that all the different races could come
[58:44] to the meetings and so that's when they
[58:47] had the meeting in Durban when they
[58:48] finally got the other held it held a big
[58:50] meeting at the racecourse and that was
[58:51] the time when 30,000 people came to the
[58:54] Lord on one night and and there were
[58:56] truckloads of stretchers and everything
[58:57] like that and I believe that's what the
[58:59] Lord had planned for every meeting for a
[59:01] month but I think they only really had
[59:03] one there like this now this was a
[59:09] painful experience for brother Brennan
[59:10] because it just went from bad to worse
[59:12] all the way around and even though God
[59:14] still moved miracles still happened I
[59:18] think he thought it's probably not over
[59:20] for me yet and he'd caught he will go
[59:23] here so here's just some of the pictures
[59:24] from that meeting massive meeting the
[59:26] head and Durban from Durban at you are
[59:30] you guys from Durban yeah cool place
[59:38] now brother branham caught african
[59:44] amoeba or something he was sick for
[59:47] about six months sick when he got back
[59:51] to America he the doctors his friend
[59:53] doctor that came to visit him sort of
[59:55] gave up what I'm saying look it's just
[59:56] it's just got to do its thing you may
[59:58] love you made don't like it into your
[59:59] brain and you might die that's just we
[1:00:00] can't do anything about this particular
[1:00:02] disease and he was sick he couldn't
[1:00:04] hardly walk he he just would stumble
[1:00:06] around the house and I don't think he
[1:00:09] was a happy man for that time you know
[1:00:11] being really sick day after day there's
[1:00:14] only so much the human mind can enjoy
[1:00:15] till you get frail and you just get down
[1:00:18] I mean I don't think he was down
[1:00:21] spiritually but he would have just been
[1:00:23] down day after day after day and any
[1:00:26] city would go and try and seek God and
[1:00:28] God it's like God wouldn't just wouldn't
[1:00:30] answer I see a girl's brother Bosworth
[1:00:32] and pray and then it's like God just
[1:00:33] turned his back no he didn't hear from
[1:00:36] God about it nothing and and to be who
[1:00:40] he was it would have been quite a hard
[1:00:41] thing he said Lord I want to read this
[1:00:44] here I said lord I appreciate the
[1:00:46] stripes and the whooping that you gave
[1:00:47] me for disobeying you but from this time
[1:00:49] on Lord knowingly ever again I'll never
[1:00:52] tie myself up with a bunch of nobody
[1:00:54] else preachers managers or no one else
[1:00:55] but I'll be free to do what you say do
[1:00:57] I'll just go where you say go and do
[1:00:58] just what you say do the rest of my life
[1:01:00] and I'll always try to do just as you
[1:01:02] say do and about that time here he come
[1:01:05] so this is after the Lord has said to
[1:01:07] him I'm sort of drummed through the
[1:01:09] story about the Lord had said look I'm
[1:01:10] gonna forgive you it's all over now
[1:01:11] and he said about that time here his
[1:01:14] Bible came again he saw in a version
[1:01:16] that race off the table and it was
[1:01:17] turned over to the place where Paul in
[1:01:19] the storm said to the men you should
[1:01:21] have listened to me and should not have
[1:01:22] loosed from Crete and none of this would
[1:01:24] have happened so the angel of God
[1:01:25] pointed this out to them so now brother
[1:01:28] Branham this whole scenario is finished
[1:01:30] and he's forgiven and he gets healed
[1:01:33] overcomes his sickness but I was
[1:01:36] interested in that that's just the way
[1:01:37] that I work
[1:01:42] now we're going to go and touch on Paul
[1:01:43] and Crete just because they've anyone
[1:01:44] looked into this but it's quite
[1:01:46] interesting I thought of you brother
[1:01:47] George this is around your area and when
[1:01:50] it was determined that we should sail to
[1:01:51] Italy a deliverer Paul and certain
[1:01:52] others prisoners until one named Julius
[1:01:54] a century novel Gustus banned and
[1:01:56] Entering up the ship after such and such
[1:01:58] a place we launched many to sell by the
[1:02:00] coast of Asia so this is the journey we
[1:02:03] were going to take this Eddy okay and
[1:02:05] the next day they touched down their
[1:02:06] leaf from down the bottom star they
[1:02:08] touch down and sidon and they said and
[1:02:12] Julius beautifully entry to Paul and
[1:02:14] gave him Liberty to go on and to his
[1:02:16] friends to refresh himself and from and
[1:02:18] when we had launched from thence we
[1:02:20] sailed under Cyprus which is around this
[1:02:22] way because the winds were contrary so
[1:02:24] this must have been the only journey
[1:02:25] they could take and when we have soured
[1:02:27] over the sea of Cecilia and pent philia
[1:02:30] we came to Myra which is here and then
[1:02:33] they were because they were sailing all
[1:02:34] the way to Rome and they tried to sail
[1:02:38] from here across the creek but the ones
[1:02:39] weren't doing much and they ended up
[1:02:41] around over here and then finally the
[1:02:43] ones picked up and they came this side
[1:02:44] and then they say they sailed around
[1:02:46] here and they ended up in here around
[1:02:49] pass the fie havens they ended up in
[1:02:50] here and this is Crete and the season
[1:02:52] was coming on there is a certain time
[1:02:54] that you that the ship stopped sailing
[1:02:57] this area here because it gets too rough
[1:02:59] and I think even today even the cruise
[1:03:00] ships there's a certain time they stop
[1:03:01] they don't sail and these open waters
[1:03:03] that must get really rough and here is
[1:03:06] where brother George is from have you
[1:03:10] been to Crete
[1:03:12] so now now when much time was spent and
[1:03:17] when sailing was now dangerous because
[1:03:19] the fast was now really passed which is
[1:03:21] a certain time of the year and they
[1:03:22] don't sail after that Paul am honestly
[1:03:24] Messina them serious I perceived that
[1:03:25] this words will be without hurt and with
[1:03:27] much damage not only of the land lading
[1:03:28] of the ship but also of our lives
[1:03:30] nevertheless the Centurion believed the
[1:03:32] master and the owner of the ship more
[1:03:33] than those things which were spoken by
[1:03:35] Paul so Paul saying we shouldn't go and
[1:03:40] these guys say we're going to go and so
[1:03:42] they set sail and I believe Paul saw a
[1:03:45] vision and and it doesn't say that here
[1:03:47] but the Bible opened up to brother
[1:03:50] Bremer said this we're having de Paul I
[1:03:51] don't think Paul just mentioned it to
[1:03:52] him once I think he said brothers and
[1:03:54] mean this is
[1:03:55] I've seen you've seen what the laws done
[1:03:57] for me we shouldn't be going on this
[1:03:58] journey it's not going to go well for us
[1:04:00] I think it would have said day after day
[1:04:01] after day that we shouldn't be doing
[1:04:02] this even when they launched we should
[1:04:04] turn around because he knew they were
[1:04:05] going in the wrong direction and we know
[1:04:07] what happened they had a big storm came
[1:04:08] up and they were almost a month out
[1:04:11] there until they finally washed up on
[1:04:13] the island of Malta have you been to
[1:04:15] Malta no it's quite a I know I'm n from
[1:04:18] there and that's where that when they
[1:04:19] were there that pulls through the snake
[1:04:22] bit him he threw it in so that was that
[1:04:24] was part of this journey outside the
[1:04:26] perfect will of God essentially but
[1:04:29] that's what happened there and they
[1:04:31] carried on so that's the story that the
[1:04:33] Lord showed to brother Brenham the
[1:04:37] interesting thing about these is God had
[1:04:39] a world and has a regular quote from
[1:04:42] brother Brennan but here's a permissive
[1:04:44] world now that's where the trouble lays
[1:04:46] we try to work on God's permissive will
[1:04:48] and he will permit it but also if we
[1:04:50] take us for muscle world though it's not
[1:04:51] right he will make us permissible to
[1:04:53] work out together to glorify His perfect
[1:04:54] will there's nothing will go wrong with
[1:04:56] God he knows just we the clock's ticking
[1:04:59] it tonight but there's nothing wrong
[1:05:01] every liquors hitting just exactly where
[1:05:02] it should be everything we think it's
[1:05:03] wrong but he knows it's right it's
[1:05:04] supposed to be like this it's a little
[1:05:07] bit miss understandable for me that
[1:05:10] concept but God is far greater than my
[1:05:12] mind that Paul was always going to go to
[1:05:16] that Island and get bit by the snake and
[1:05:18] flick it off the net those men were
[1:05:20] going to come in from Malta but yet he
[1:05:23] wasn't supposed to be there but you know
[1:05:26] work that way
[1:05:27] this and but God but brother Graham says
[1:05:31] God's got a way of making everything
[1:05:33] work to his perfect will even when man
[1:05:35] goes a different direction he can still
[1:05:37] turn it all to make it work for his
[1:05:38] perfect world even though man's world
[1:05:40] goes a certain way okay I'm gonna make
[1:05:44] this now I want to go back to the story
[1:05:46] with that information in mind I'm not
[1:05:49] going to say this is the interpretation
[1:05:51] of the story but it's the only way I can
[1:05:53] understand it and when you think about
[1:05:56] what happened in Africa how these men
[1:05:58] had this world and they wouldn't Bend on
[1:05:59] their will and they and brother Brown as
[1:06:01] much as much as he tried to tell them
[1:06:03] the will of God the human will wouldn't
[1:06:05] Bend they said no so God being PEZ well
[1:06:08] to the
[1:06:09] will because he still want a brother
[1:06:11] round to go around amazing God changed
[1:06:14] his will to say okay we'll do what you
[1:06:16] want to do then that's fine that's what
[1:06:19] he did and you deceive it so we can't
[1:06:22] actually have our will so strong that we
[1:06:25] can actually go a certain way and Bend
[1:06:26] God's will to go our way and God will
[1:06:30] still be with us but he's not really
[1:06:31] with us but he's with us you know what I
[1:06:32] mean we can bend his will and we've got
[1:06:38] a interesting to see how we lead our
[1:06:40] life so so this thing it happened and
[1:06:44] all the children of Israel gathered
[1:06:46] together in Mizpah and when they were in
[1:06:52] misfire they all had the same wealth
[1:06:56] because the next one here says so all
[1:06:59] the men of Israel will get it together
[1:07:00] against the city knit together as one
[1:07:02] man they all had one world we're going
[1:07:06] to go down and wipe out those people
[1:07:07] that's it
[1:07:10] that was their will four hundred
[1:07:12] thousand men had we're not to get it as
[1:07:14] one man so now what they now do is they
[1:07:20] go and ask counsel of God they say God
[1:07:22] we want to ask you some counsel you know
[1:07:25] what they asked them they said we're
[1:07:27] going to give you twelve options you
[1:07:29] pick which one you want to take that's
[1:07:32] what they said because there were twelve
[1:07:35] tribes they say which one of us do you
[1:07:36] want to go up first not Joey go up not
[1:07:41] Lord God this is great son yeah
[1:07:45] God we're gathered to give it to you
[1:07:47] because this has happen houses happen in
[1:07:48] our country you Lord we we don't have
[1:07:50] any preconceived force what we're going
[1:07:52] to do we just come before you and we
[1:07:53] just want to lay the situation before
[1:07:54] you they simply give you twelve options
[1:07:56] eleven options which one he's going to
[1:07:58] take he said I'll take option one thanks
[1:08:01] Judah that's what he said Lord who shall
[1:08:05] we seen that first seen Judah so Judah
[1:08:10] goes up what happens to Judah gone God
[1:08:15] didn't say he just answered their
[1:08:17] question I believe that was a now when
[1:08:21] you start thinking permissive well here
[1:08:24] so they so they after this they
[1:08:27] encourage themselves in the Lord and
[1:08:29] they get back says they the people the
[1:08:32] men of Israel encourage themselves in
[1:08:34] their battle again an array in the
[1:08:35] places where they put themselves and
[1:08:37] array the first day so they sit that's
[1:08:38] right - sit back let's gather together
[1:08:40] and do this again they encourage
[1:08:42] themselves we're going to do this don't
[1:08:44] falter brethren keep our minds strong
[1:08:46] and this purpose that's what they did
[1:08:48] and then they went back to God and they
[1:08:50] said shall we go again to battle so
[1:08:52] there stands to get a wee bit more
[1:08:53] humble but they said sure we go again
[1:08:55] God says yeah go again they wanted to go
[1:08:59] again anyway because they were all
[1:09:00] encouraged in the Lord and we're going
[1:09:01] to go back again and what these what
[1:09:03] that Benjamin writes out so they went
[1:09:05] again and they were beaten again now the
[1:09:08] third time they were a bit more humble
[1:09:10] but I think their will was still beating
[1:09:12] a certain way so God
[1:09:15] Gordon essentially bins as well to their
[1:09:18] will and says ok go up tomorrow again
[1:09:20] this time you'll beat him ok
[1:09:24] they go up and they kill these people
[1:09:26] their City and then they go on this
[1:09:30] rampage throughout all of the tribe of
[1:09:34] Benjamin and kill everyone there I don't
[1:09:38] believe it was God's perfect will to
[1:09:40] wipe out the tribe of Benjamin there see
[1:09:44] that wasn't God's perfect will if he
[1:09:47] hadn't have intervened in the situation
[1:09:48] these these means intention was to just
[1:09:50] wipe out the whole tribe so we talked
[1:09:54] you know we need to focus about God's
[1:09:55] permit his perfect well still working in
[1:09:57] situations I believe that it was of God
[1:10:00] that these 600 men escaped up to the
[1:10:01] hill somehow during the battle things
[1:10:04] would have happened in it just the
[1:10:06] children of Benjamin just couldn't get
[1:10:07] these men and they they just didn't work
[1:10:08] and they went away and they had to chase
[1:10:10] on these other men and these men escaped
[1:10:12] because otherwise the whole tribe would
[1:10:15] have been wiped out and yet God had said
[1:10:18] you will win that day and I'll be with
[1:10:19] you and you're one essentially now when
[1:10:25] this rampage had finished and there they
[1:10:27] will have started to they started to
[1:10:30] come to themselves a bit more I guess
[1:10:31] you'd say they were so worked up and
[1:10:33] they could actually be a bit more
[1:10:36] what's the word receptive to - they
[1:10:43] started to feel bad
[1:10:44] oh god how could it be that was their
[1:10:47] question Oh Lord God of Israel why is
[1:10:49] this come to pass this day there shall
[1:10:51] be today one tribe lacking in Israel why
[1:10:53] is this come to pass
[1:10:54] they start to I think the the will of
[1:10:57] God as they start to relax a bit more
[1:10:59] and their own because they've done their
[1:11:01] well now okay we've done that now once
[1:11:03] you've done something your will to do it
[1:11:04] goes away so this now that now the will
[1:11:07] of God can start to see dallona but they
[1:11:08] thinking why have we done this but they
[1:11:11] had already done it they'd already
[1:11:12] walked in his permissive will and the
[1:11:15] thing about going in his permissive will
[1:11:17] it's just me see
[1:11:20] it's me see we miss things up and we we
[1:11:25] make a big mess and then that miss has
[1:11:28] got to get cleaned up some here yeah
[1:11:29] gotta get so what they had here now was
[1:11:32] a miss Wow here now we've almost wiped
[1:11:36] the whole tribe that is only 600 min
[1:11:38] left what are we gonna do and we've all
[1:11:41] given an oath we're not going to give
[1:11:43] you any of our daughters so these this
[1:11:44] tribe is going to die it's a mess
[1:11:47] they've created this big mess from the
[1:11:49] own will and then they have to try and
[1:11:52] clean this mess up so they're going to
[1:11:54] make more miss well does what we do
[1:11:55] we'll go and kill this whole other city
[1:11:57] and get those woman and give them to
[1:11:59] them make more trouble just to clean up
[1:12:02] a mess that they made through their own
[1:12:04] will and when that didn't work it wasn't
[1:12:07] enough
[1:12:07] they said ok we'll we'll just work it
[1:12:09] ass out this little way that ok kidnap
[1:12:11] all these girls from here and take them
[1:12:13] up when you get to the end of the story
[1:12:16] you think man what an absolute mess
[1:12:18] these men made you think if they had
[1:12:21] have gone there and most parents said oh
[1:12:22] god what do we not what do we do God we
[1:12:24] bring the situation to you how do you
[1:12:27] want to deal with this but not no no I
[1:12:30] had even one deal with that Lord it's
[1:12:31] just we just give it to you this is
[1:12:34] horrible this is it would mean that
[1:12:36] we're trying to go after other meaning
[1:12:37] when they couldn't give it they killed
[1:12:38] this other woman this is we just we
[1:12:42] don't want this Lord guy we bring it to
[1:12:44] you God could have
[1:12:47] he could have he could have actually
[1:12:48] made doesn't mean died right there or he
[1:12:50] could have said go down to the city and
[1:12:52] even if the men of the city said no
[1:12:54] we're not gonna send them out maybe
[1:12:55] there could have been an old man in
[1:12:56] there you know the Bible talks about
[1:12:57] this no let's not all die for the sake
[1:12:58] of these men let's cast them out you
[1:13:00] know and take them in and slave him
[1:13:02] something you know I'm saying like he
[1:13:05] could have been a simple solution if the
[1:13:06] head have just sought God I said God
[1:13:08] what do you want us to do I don't
[1:13:09] believe God would have done this this
[1:13:13] way I don't believe this was his perfect
[1:13:16] will to go and cause so much miss that
[1:13:18] he did God's Way would have been he God
[1:13:21] wanted to execute judgment upon these
[1:13:23] people and he one of the tribe to carry
[1:13:25] on that was his perfect world but these
[1:13:26] mean went out to try and do it they
[1:13:29] forgot about the second when they tried
[1:13:30] to do the first one execute judgment
[1:13:31] their way and then whoops would be to
[1:13:33] try and carry this trial and so would do
[1:13:34] this to carry that on they made an
[1:13:36] absolute mess of the situation destroyed
[1:13:38] lives and caused you think of the car
[1:13:43] the hurt and that area for generations
[1:13:45] to come
[1:13:46] about what happened not just them but
[1:13:48] like these the woman that were taken
[1:13:50] away kidnapped and their families broken
[1:13:51] up and everything and all us that would
[1:13:53] have been dramatic for that whole area
[1:13:55] yeah for a hundred years where God could
[1:13:58] have dealt with that and an incident
[1:14:00] clean it's just done people were
[1:14:01] rejoicing God's put away the wickedness
[1:14:03] from amongst us all however and yet
[1:14:06] man's the will was so strong that they
[1:14:09] that God let them go their way and just
[1:14:10] make this big mess and I guess when we
[1:14:18] it was an interesting story for me
[1:14:20] because I when you look into this you
[1:14:23] think God I want to keep not my will but
[1:14:25] thine be done
[1:14:26] i I don't ever want to get into this
[1:14:29] predicament where where I've got where
[1:14:31] I'm sitting on doing something and then
[1:14:32] you come and join me in that just
[1:14:34] because I want to and I and because it's
[1:14:35] going to end anytime the man did that it
[1:14:38] ended in a disaster and and Lord I pray
[1:14:41] Lord may may I always be humble and lay
[1:14:44] aside my will and say Lord I'm not going
[1:14:46] to try solve problems and I'm going to
[1:14:47] bring them to you I'm not going to try
[1:14:49] to figure out my own direction in life
[1:14:50] I'm gonna give it to you do what you
[1:14:52] want to do I want your perfect will and
[1:14:55] I don't want to forge on with my idea
[1:14:57] because it
[1:14:59] by my research it doesn't work and and I
[1:15:05] believe that a sincere the beautiful
[1:15:09] thing is with God is that as brother
[1:15:11] Branham said he actually makes it all
[1:15:13] work out anyway
[1:15:15] and you good even though you do that
[1:15:18] I'll choose a rather choose this path
[1:15:20] even though you'll be faithful to me
[1:15:22] you'll make it all work some way because
[1:15:25] we we don't get too discouraged by it
[1:15:27] because we make mistakes God makes it
[1:15:30] all work out perfect in the end and all
[1:15:33] those situations it all worked out it
[1:15:35] just wasn't quite as good as what he
[1:15:36] could have made it yeah and that's
[1:15:38] that's I believe as Christians that's
[1:15:39] what we want and as we go on more in our
[1:15:41] walk we we make mistakes here and there
[1:15:44] and we just slowly learned his voice we
[1:15:46] learn when we do wrong when we do right
[1:15:47] and we we slowly know what direction we
[1:15:50] should go and we and I believe those of
[1:15:52] us you know we're all sincere and we we
[1:15:54] really desire the will of God for the
[1:15:56] perfect will of God for a lie I really
[1:15:57] believe that I mean that some let's just
[1:16:01] stand tonight we're just um pray and
[1:16:04] then sing a song
[1:16:16] heavenly father we're so grateful Lord
[1:16:18] that you are the great Shepherd as David
[1:16:21] said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[1:16:22] want he leadeth me beside the still
[1:16:24] waters
[1:16:25] Lord and through the green pastures Lord
[1:16:28] then he goes on to say yea though I walk
[1:16:29] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:16:31] death I'll fear no evil for thou art
[1:16:32] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:16:34] comfort me
[1:16:35] Lord and it's nice to know that you are
[1:16:37] the great Shepherd Lord that if we just
[1:16:42] follow your leadership Lord that your
[1:16:44] leadership to us is always good it's
[1:16:46] always perfect your will for our life is
[1:16:49] always good Lord and may you give us
[1:16:53] ears to hear Lord in our mind to
[1:16:55] understand what your what your will is
[1:16:57] for us each day not only a big decisions
[1:17:01] a little bit in small decisions may we
[1:17:02] be conscious Lord that you have a will
[1:17:04] you have a a desire for us Lord and as
[1:17:10] brother Brennan would say Lord that that
[1:17:11] he would realize that life was far too
[1:17:13] complicated for him and there were far
[1:17:17] too many variables that he would he felt
[1:17:19] safer just waking up in the morning and
[1:17:20] asking you to lead him say Lord lead me
[1:17:22] through the day it's too treacherous for
[1:17:24] me I I start leading my own world my own
[1:17:26] way and I just make a huge mess of it by
[1:17:28] the end of the day there's me so I've
[1:17:29] ruined lives I've done this I've done
[1:17:31] that Lord just lead me today Lord Lord
[1:17:33] and I believe that's each person's
[1:17:35] prayer here tonight Lord that that we
[1:17:37] will be sensitive to your leadership and
[1:17:39] that that we would walk in your Perfect
[1:17:42] well and that Lord you're faithful to us
[1:17:44] Lord that that you don't leave us or
[1:17:46] forsake us you don't just think oh oh I
[1:17:48] try to tell them what's do they goal or
[1:17:49] but your Lord you have a desire for us
[1:17:53] and I believe your desire is strong that
[1:17:54] we would walk in your Perfect well and
[1:17:57] walk in your ways Lord so we just want
[1:17:59] to yes commit this the service to you
