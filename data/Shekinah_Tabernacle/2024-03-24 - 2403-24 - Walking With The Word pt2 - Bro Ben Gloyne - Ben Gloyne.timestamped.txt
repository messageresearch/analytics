[6:10] good
[6:11] morning welcome to church this
[6:13] morning amen it's good to be able to
[6:17] worship God this morning I believe we're
[6:19] in for a great time anytime we meet with
[6:21] God it's always a great time amen amen
[6:23] so and I don't believe that we've met
[6:25] here in vain the Lord said we are two or
[6:27] three are gathered together in my name
[6:29] there I in the midst
[6:31] and I always like the verse in the Bible
[6:34] that where Paul says you know we don't
[6:36] follow cunningly devised fables this is
[6:38] not just a made up thing this is a
[6:39] reality that we can meet the Living God
[6:41] this morning we haven't made all this
[6:43] effort to drive here and set all this up
[6:45] just
[6:46] to for some little occasion but we
[6:49] actually are meeting with the Living God
[6:50] this morning we're in an atmosphere
[6:51] where God can change us and the more
[6:56] that we just accept that and we grasp
[6:58] that and enter by faith then the more we
[7:00] get out of it amen you know because
[7:02] Satan's whole job is to convince us that
[7:04] it's not true that all and to to to make
[7:07] us not enter in by faith but all we have
[7:09] to do is keep entering in by faith and
[7:11] we just receive a blessing you know so
[7:13] so that's the that's the that's the way
[7:16] we're coming this morning and and I
[7:17] believe we're going to um the worship is
[7:21] going to be good the praise and we're
[7:23] going to hear from the Lord this morning
[7:24] in the ministry of the word of God Hey
[7:26] Brother Pedro didn't see you there how
[7:28] are you bro good
[7:32] amen we had
[7:34] um we had a big group come into the the
[7:39] cafe and they they said they were they'd
[7:41] heard about it and they were in there
[7:42] scouting it out so are you on a scouting
[7:46] Mission are
[7:46] [Music]
[7:50] you I don't know why I said that but I
[7:52] just remember we joked around about them
[7:54] scouting the whole night they were there
[7:56] was about 12 of them um okay let's stand
[7:59] this morning and let's
[8:03] um I'm going to put you on the spot too
[8:05] but I don't usually ask people to come
[8:06] up and pray but have about you can bring
[8:08] the little guy up too go come up and
[8:11] open in a word of prayer this morning
[8:12] yeah can we have that
[8:13] [Music]
[8:21] one oh two of them a double
[8:24] [Laughter]
[8:26] [Music]
[8:28] blessing
[8:31] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[8:34] Mighty God lord here we are God once
[8:36] more God because we have come from
[8:39] different places God to worship your
[8:40] name God Heavenly Father the Bible say
[8:43] we're two or three we're Gathering your
[8:45] name God you will be there in the midst
[8:47] heavenly father so today I can see more
[8:49] than two or three God so we have come
[8:52] expecting God that you will speak to our
[8:54] hearts God and we are not going to walk
[8:57] away from this place the same way that
[9:00] we came in God so we are expecting God
[9:02] that you are going to speak God through
[9:04] your servant God that you are going to
[9:07] anoint him God and be with us God we
[9:10] need more and more of you heavenly
[9:12] father that is why we are here today God
[9:15] cuz we need more and more of you
[9:17] heavenly father so we ask you now God to
[9:20] be with us God and bless us God so when
[9:24] we leave this place we can say we are
[9:27] not the same on God so we ask you to
[9:29] bless us God in Jesus name

[40:24] may and if you're not may the Lord be
[40:25] with you as well so amen so let's just
[40:28] um go to the scripture this morning
[40:30] we're going to go to Luke uh chapter 18
[40:33] going to read a couple of places here
[40:35] and then we're going to go to Joshua I
[40:36] want to continue my thought from last
[40:38] Sunday about the giban ites and um this
[40:41] is this is a beit uh yeah this will be a
[40:43] bit of a different one but hey here we
[40:45] are so Luke um 18 and: 10-14 says here
[40:50] two men went up into the temple to pray
[40:53] the one a Pharisee and the other a
[40:55] Publican the Pharisees stood and
[40:57] betrayed thus with himself God I thank
[40:59] thee for I'm not as other men are
[41:01] extortioners unjust adulterers or even
[41:04] as this Publican I fast twice in the
[41:06] week I give tithes of all that I possess
[41:09] and the Publican standing a far off
[41:11] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[41:14] unto heaven but smoted upon his breast
[41:16] saying God be merciful to me a sinner I
[41:20] tell you this man went down to his house
[41:21] Justified rather than the other for
[41:24] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[41:26] abased and he that humbleth himself
[41:29] shall be exalted amen and we're just
[41:32] going to go to Joshua chapter 9 again as
[41:34] well um going to read here just about
[41:39] these these these deceitful ones and the
[41:42] most deceitful gibian is the one that
[41:44] looks like you it's easy to say about
[41:47] false Doctrine and cold formal spirits
[41:49] and all those things we covered last
[41:50] Sunday but when the Gib knite looks like
[41:53] you it's a different thing and um so
[41:57] Joshua 9 that's kind of where I'm going
[41:58] today this is going to be a bit
[42:00] different I think but anyway Joshua 9
[42:02] and verses 3 to6 and when the
[42:03] inhabitants of gibian heard what Joshua
[42:06] had done unto Jericho and to AI they did
[42:09] work uh willly however you say and went
[42:12] and made as it uh made as if they had
[42:16] been ambassadors and took old sacks from
[42:18] their asses and wine bottles old and
[42:20] rent and bound up and old shoes and and
[42:23] clouded um upon their feet and old
[42:26] garments upon them and all the bread of
[42:28] their Provisions was dry and moldy and
[42:30] they went to Joshua unto the unto the
[42:32] camp of gilgal and said unto him and to
[42:34] the men of Israel we become come from a
[42:37] far country now therefore make ye a
[42:39] league with us amen so let's bow our
[42:42] heads for prayer this morning if you
[42:43] want to be remembered just want to raise
[42:45] your hand to the Lord this morning
[42:47] gracious father we're so thankful Lord
[42:49] truly you are the the Great and Mighty
[42:52] almighty God and I pray father you'd
[42:54] open our spiritual eyes to see you in
[42:57] your place where you belong oh God the
[42:59] highest Place Lord I pray you would be
[43:01] exalted in the service as we have come
[43:04] together this morning Lord we truly
[43:06] desire that you'll come and touch our
[43:07] hearts like only you can Lord may you
[43:09] walk the aisles Lord walk every every
[43:12] seat touch every life from the oldest of
[43:14] us to the youngest of us oh God from the
[43:16] speaker to hearer Lord have your way
[43:18] those who are watching Dear God I pray
[43:19] you'll Lord may you just move in great
[43:21] power Lord For Your Glory and we just
[43:23] want to commit the service into your
[43:24] hands may you be with us Lord a very
[43:27] personal way today we thank you for this
[43:29] opportunity we can gather together and
[43:31] Worship You Lord we want to worship you
[43:33] in spirit and in truth so may have your
[43:35] way Among Us Lord we love you we thank
[43:37] you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[43:40] bless you friends you may have your
[43:42] seats this morning so I want to speak
[43:44] about the idol of a flawed self now
[43:46] these gibian nightes we know they were
[43:48] the reason I'm putting them in the same
[43:50] category of person is because they came
[43:52] in by deception and it's amazing when
[43:56] when when we look at
[43:57] how man man has been made and
[44:00] constructed by God but yet people people
[44:03] will allow Idols to come into their
[44:05] heart and they will worship they will
[44:07] walk their whole life because of an idol
[44:10] now Christine's parents they knew a I
[44:12] could say Christine Stephany and Elana's
[44:14] parents uh praise the Lord reing family
[44:17] reunion I like it amen they knew a man
[44:19] that was a Christian of some sort but
[44:21] this man would never get married uh uh
[44:24] because of how his mother treated him
[44:27] and how his father uh was a distant man
[44:30] and and the whole reason that he refused
[44:32] to get married is because he didn't want
[44:34] to give his parents' grandchildren
[44:36] because it would bring them
[44:38] joy and the Lord spoke to uh Christine's
[44:41] mom and said this man is worshiping the
[44:44] idol of a broken
[44:46] heart now so I could say he had a flawed
[44:48] image in front of him that he was
[44:50] actually worshiping see we understand
[44:52] that Idols aren't naturally made of
[44:53] stone or wood or you know something man
[44:56] constructed physic physically but they
[44:57] are a thing in a spirit that can come in
[45:00] through pain or hurt or whatever it is
[45:02] but there's an idol that can come into
[45:04] the person's heart yet they are
[45:05] Christians but yet they will worship
[45:07] they will walk with God through these
[45:09] things so this man would it's amazing
[45:11] when you think about it he would he
[45:12] would because of because of this Idol of
[45:14] a broken heart he would refuse to even
[45:17] have the idea of getting married he
[45:18] would he would refuse even maybe have
[45:20] conversations with with maybe potential
[45:23] you know spouses he wouldn't he wouldn't
[45:25] enter into conversations with them he
[45:27] wouldn't go into deeper conversations
[45:29] with them he wouldn't allow his heart to
[45:30] come open you know all these things he
[45:32] would cut off a big section of his life
[45:34] just because of this
[45:36] Idol now you say that that that is a
[45:38] great tragedy and to me that is a great
[45:40] tragedy but to me it's also a great
[45:42] tragedy where a where a person can be
[45:45] sitting in church they can be they can
[45:46] be believing this message and they can
[45:49] they can you know be be be a believer
[45:51] but yet on the inside they can be
[45:53] worshiping a flawed image of themselves
[45:56] and this is this is why I said the giban
[45:58] that's the most deceitful one is the one
[46:00] that looks like you and we know that the
[46:02] devil will never put an image in front
[46:04] of us that is of Victory as of peace and
[46:07] joy and everything that the Lord died
[46:09] that we would possess he would never put
[46:11] that in front of us but he will put
[46:13] something that is always degraded always
[46:15] broken remember he is the perverter he
[46:17] cannot create anything new he's not a
[46:19] Creator he'll take what God has made and
[46:21] will pervert it that's why this world is
[46:23] in this chaos that's in is because
[46:25] because the devil took righteousness and
[46:27] brought sin in and brought perversion
[46:30] and so he will bring into our minds a
[46:32] perverted image of what a Christian
[46:33] should be yet yet it may look all all
[46:36] all on the outward fine you may tick a
[46:38] lot of boxes outwardly and speak the
[46:41] part and play the part and do all those
[46:43] things but on the inside there is a very
[46:46] different kind of an idol than you know
[46:48] it's not God on the inside there's a
[46:51] there's a complex that's coming a pain
[46:53] or a hurt or something that that that
[46:55] that man has allowed to enter into a
[46:57] person and um defiles him isn't it
[47:01] amazing when you look at this man see
[47:03] see this Pharisee he wasn't in the
[47:04] temple to worship God at all even though
[47:07] he was standing in the temple and it
[47:08] looked like he was praying but you see
[47:10] he was actually worshiping an image of
[47:12] himself he was he was exalting what he
[47:15] had become and we know as the Bride of
[47:18] Jesus Christ if we truly have the
[47:19] Revelation that we are his bride it
[47:21] makes us very humble people am me
[47:23] because we see his Supreme Grace would
[47:24] reach down his hand way down into the
[47:27] mac andm and darkness of sin and pull us
[47:29] out and wash us and cleanse us and make
[47:31] us new creatures and you know you know
[47:33] you when when you really realize what
[47:35] the Lord has done you cannot be proud
[47:37] you cannot be arrogant at all but it
[47:38] makes you humble and so thankful that
[47:40] God would find you and not just find you
[47:42] but drag you out and deliver you and do
[47:44] a mighty Deliverance in your life and
[47:46] change you forever more but you see this
[47:48] man see this is what Idols do see he
[47:50] says he prayed thus with himself so he
[47:52] separated himself from among the
[47:54] congregation there would have been many
[47:56] people in the the temple but you see he
[47:58] separated himself out from among the
[47:59] Believers because he was worshiping an
[48:02] image that he had crafted of his own
[48:05] self and this is the problem with a
[48:06] legalistic spirit is it will it will
[48:09] exalt itself above someone else it will
[48:11] always try and do more than the next
[48:14] person it's you know the saying of
[48:15] keeping up with the Joneses of you know
[48:17] someone buys a new car you want a new
[48:19] car and different things well this comes
[48:21] right into the ranks of Believers where
[48:23] they try and they say well this family
[48:25] is doing better than mine spirit or this
[48:27] person is doing better than me
[48:28] spiritually so I've got to up my game
[48:30] that's a legalistic idol that's com into
[48:32] someone's heart you know we're not here
[48:33] to compare ourselves with ourselves as
[48:36] the Bible instructs us if we compare
[48:38] ourselves with ourselves we are unwise
[48:40] and I don't believe I'm looking at a
[48:42] foolish people this morning I believe
[48:43] I'm looking at a wise people a wise
[48:45] woman who's filled with the wisdom of
[48:47] God am mean by the baptism of the Holy
[48:49] Ghost so we're not here to to compare
[48:51] ourselves among ourselves or you know
[48:53] try and try and keep pigs because if you
[48:55] look at this man
[48:57] look at all the things he says he's done
[48:59] God isn't even in the picture he's just
[49:01] thanking God basically saying God I'm
[49:03] doing you a service here you know I'm
[49:05] actually doing you a favor you should be
[49:08] thanking me God you should be worshiping
[49:09] me God because because of what I've done
[49:12] look at me I'm awesome this is an idol
[49:14] of a flawed self cuz anything that takes
[49:17] worship from God is an idol and it's
[49:20] flawed amen because he should be the
[49:22] center of our lives he should be the
[49:24] purpose of Our Lives he should be our
[49:26] main he should be our affection he
[49:28] should be our joy he should be our
[49:30] everything amen Our Lives should be so
[49:32] intertwined with him wrapped up in his
[49:34] love amen but you see this man wasn't
[49:37] even thinking about those things no he
[49:39] was exalting what he perceived himself
[49:41] to be and you can see as the Lord would
[49:44] even say this man one went away
[49:46] Justified but the other did not and even
[49:49] this Publican when he said be merciful
[49:51] to me a sinner says here um um
[49:53] Scofield's got a note that I quite like
[49:55] he's saying basically look upon me as
[49:58] you look upon the blood of your mercy
[50:00] seat this is what he's saying in terms
[50:02] of Mercy look at me the same way you
[50:04] look upon the atoning blood look upon me
[50:06] the same way Lord and to me that you
[50:08] should be our hearts cry as well when we
[50:10] come to the Lord say Lord don't look
[50:12] upon me with with you know my abilities
[50:15] and what I do and what I think I am may
[50:17] you just see your blood when you look
[50:18] upon me Lord when you're not even not
[50:21] not even see me but you may just hear my
[50:23] voice through your
[50:24] blood so you see this man had a flawed a
[50:28] an idol of a flawed self now these
[50:31] things are very damaging because Jonah
[50:33] and I want to I pray this would the
[50:35] scripture would just be engraved in our
[50:37] hearts by the Holy Ghost this morning
[50:39] that they that OB observe lying vanities
[50:41] forsake their own Mercy now it's very
[50:43] easy to say lying vanities a sickness
[50:45] and you know trouble and oppression and
[50:47] sure all those things are lying vanities
[50:49] but the biggest lying vanity is when a
[50:51] person will will have an image of a
[50:53] flawed self in front of them where they
[50:56] will they will have an image of what a
[50:58] Christian should be but it's not and
[51:00] they will worship that you see man is
[51:03] made to worship am mean even even even
[51:06] as we because we know that um when when
[51:09] God created man God created man in his
[51:11] own image we know that was originally
[51:13] Spirit man so man was made to be a God
[51:17] we understand that man was was given
[51:20] dominion over over creation he was a God
[51:22] right so so man was made because man was
[51:25] made in the image of God and God is a
[51:28] God he is the god right I know this is
[51:30] very by Elementary but but I want you to
[51:32] think about it God made man in his own
[51:34] image so what that's a spirit to have
[51:37] dominion to be a God over the Earth as
[51:39] brother Bram would tell us that actually
[51:41] man was made to be an amateur or a
[51:43] little God he says but in Genesis 2 when
[51:47] he made man he said I am y a h u j u v
[51:50] uh Yahweh Jehovah what does it mean I am
[51:54] the all existent one who has created
[51:56] something of myself to be a son of mine
[51:58] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[52:00] of mine Glory why he gave man Jehovah
[52:04] means he gave man to be an amateur God
[52:07] because he is Father God and he made a
[52:09] man an amateur God so he isn't
[52:11] self-existent anymore he exists with his
[52:14] family Ella Ella Elohim now he is
[52:17] Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists
[52:19] with his family Hallelujah now God made
[52:22] man to be the predominant over the uh
[52:25] over all the Earth Earth he had dominion
[52:28] and the Earth was man's Dominion is that
[52:31] scripture now if that's his Dominion he
[52:33] was God over the Earth he could speak it
[52:35] would be so he could speak this and it
[52:37] would be so oh there he is god Jehovah
[52:39] the one who once existed in
[52:41] self-existence but now exist with his
[52:44] family and his little ones with him
[52:46] there you are am mean so God made man to
[52:50] be a God so what does that God means an
[52:53] object of worship the English word means
[52:55] that so now man because he has fallen
[52:58] has to worship something now brother
[53:01] Braham tells us you can make anything of
[53:03] God you can make your hobby of God your
[53:06] job your family even your church can be
[53:08] a can be an idol anything but you know
[53:11] really the most deceptive one is when
[53:13] you make yourself a God in your own eyes
[53:16] and that's not always some great
[53:18] Majestic something that's all powerful
[53:20] and all Incredible or inspiring that
[53:22] when you walk into the room the whole
[53:24] room should hush and because you've
[53:26] stepped and you know you're the greatest
[53:28] thing since sliced bread and you know no
[53:30] but it can be a decept a a a fallen
[53:33] flawed self can become an idol on and I
[53:37] think that is the greatest problem that
[53:40] comes especially among Believers
[53:41] actually even even if you look at this
[53:43] world we live in this Mental Health
[53:44] crisis that the world is in what are
[53:46] people looking they look in their own
[53:48] psyche and all they see is darkness and
[53:51] pain and misery and sorrow because
[53:53] they're unconverted and if you look in
[53:55] the human spirit and and the human
[53:57] Spirit or the human nature that is
[53:58] unconverted brother Bram says is worse
[54:00] than an animal so that's why this world
[54:02] is so broken because they're looking
[54:04] within themselves and just seeing no
[54:06] they don't see a remedy they just see
[54:08] problems it's like if you a doctor and
[54:10] you would examine a patient and you had
[54:11] no help for that person then all you'd
[54:13] see would be problems amen but you see
[54:16] the reason there's an examination is
[54:17] because they have an ability to fix
[54:19] something amen and and and we have far
[54:21] greater than human medicine Among Us
[54:23] this morning but we have the Lord God
[54:24] that heals all of our diseases so we
[54:26] have the problem we have the solution
[54:28] rather to every problem but you see what
[54:30] will happen is man will take a complex
[54:32] of pain or defect what they perceive as
[54:34] a defect in their own human spirit and
[54:36] they will worship
[54:38] that and you are what you behold you
[54:41] become what you behold amen as as
[54:44] Brother David Silas said a few uh Easter
[54:46] conventions ago he said you are your
[54:48] ambition so what your ambition is you
[54:51] will become that ambition if your
[54:52] ambition is to float with this world and
[54:54] just Cruise along you'll become that if
[54:56] your ambition is to become the best bum
[54:58] there's ever been on the street you'll
[54:59] become that because you become your
[55:01] ambition but if your ambition is to give
[55:03] your whole life to the Lord to make to
[55:05] give yourself as a Living Sacrifice to
[55:07] let him live no matter what what what
[55:09] capacity whatever that is but let him
[55:11] live you will become that ambition amen
[55:13] if your ambition is Lord I want you to
[55:15] live I want you to manifest your word in
[55:18] my life I want you to prove the power of
[55:19] your blood in my life I want you to be
[55:21] exalted I want you to be worshiped I
[55:23] want you to be adored you'll become that
[55:25] amen
[55:27] but it depends what kind of image you
[55:29] put in front of yourself amen as brother
[55:32] bramwood say when he's um uh I think
[55:34] he's in prayer this is the message the
[55:36] great Shining Light he says although
[55:38] peculiar yet the star was brilliant not
[55:41] brilliant in world's educational worlds
[55:43] of fear but brilliant as sacrifice
[55:45] before the Lord he says we prostrate
[55:47] ourselves as the Magi did in the
[55:49] presence of the king of kings to reflect
[55:52] his light amen and this is what we've
[55:55] been made to we built to do is to
[55:57] reflect his light to this Dying World so
[55:59] you'll reflect something but it depends
[56:01] what you put in front of yourself you
[56:03] see it's it's amazing how you know man
[56:07] if we if I can just find this here he
[56:09] would brother Brown would say about how
[56:11] the blood has never given a person a
[56:14] complex but yet people get
[56:18] complexes he say and and and we're just
[56:20] talking about this Pharisee in the
[56:22] temple but we'll come for we'll Advance
[56:24] further on than that but he says a men
[56:26] educate themselves till they they'll
[56:28] educate themselves away from one another
[56:30] they get complexes you don't get no
[56:32] complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you
[56:34] get love that's where you get love not a
[56:36] complex now that I'm a little bigger
[56:38] than someone else a little B than
[56:40] somebody else and know just a little
[56:42] more than somebody else you just got
[56:44] your arms around everybody and it's a
[56:46] basis of Love through the blood the
[56:48] blood cleanses so I and and I think
[56:51] that's very true I've never seen the
[56:52] blood of Jesus Christ give give anyone a
[56:55] complex I've never seen someone have a
[56:57] genuine salvation experience filled with
[56:59] the Holy Ghost and it's given them a
[57:01] complex I've never seen that in my life
[57:03] but yet man will get complexes and and
[57:06] and the reason is because the devil will
[57:08] put a perverted image in front of them
[57:10] and they will they will want to become
[57:12] for some reason they will think that's
[57:14] the right image to to
[57:18] behold now this Pharisee would would
[57:22] Jesus would say Beware of the scribes
[57:24] which desire to walk in Long robes and
[57:25] love love greetings in the markets and
[57:28] the highest seat in the synagogues and
[57:29] the chief room at rooms at feasts which
[57:32] devour widows houses and for show make
[57:35] long prayers the same shall receive a
[57:37] greater damnation now you think you
[57:39] think if we step back 2,000 years ago
[57:41] and and and we saw these very people
[57:43] that Jesus was actually referring to I
[57:46] doubt any one of them actually had a had
[57:48] an evil intent in their heart I doubt
[57:50] very much they rejoiced at how many
[57:52] widow's houses they devoured that week
[57:54] you know I doubt very much they had a
[57:56] they had a um you know a a certain
[57:58] number that they had to devour in a year
[58:00] you know that they're looking for
[58:02] promotion look I did a 100 this year I'm
[58:03] going to become come a chief Pharisee I
[58:05] doubt very much they had that in their
[58:06] hearts they genuinely wanted to serve
[58:08] God but you see they had an image before
[58:11] them of the more love and affection that
[58:13] you can get the the the more Prestige
[58:16] that you can obtain that you're actually
[58:18] a better Christian but that's but but
[58:20] that is an image of a flawed self
[58:22] because as a man was made to be a God so
[58:25] a fallen man will want worship that's
[58:28] why there's Kingdom Builders you know
[58:30] even in the message they want worship
[58:31] they want to be exalted that it's their
[58:33] name that's the most important one you
[58:35] know and and and and sadly this is
[58:37] because of Fallen man they want to be
[58:40] they want to be acknowledged I want
[58:42] Jesus Christ to be acknowledged I want
[58:44] him to be known I want his name to be
[58:46] known I don't care about my name I
[58:48] really don't my name will help you
[58:51] none none his name will give you eternal
[58:54] life am mean so I'm not interested in
[58:56] recognition I don't care about any of
[58:58] those things I want him to be known
[59:00] that's the one thing that'll satisfy me
[59:01] is people have a like brother BR said
[59:03] the end of the church H book The one
[59:05] thing he has desired is that man and God
[59:07] will have a true spiritual relationship
[59:09] that man will walk according to the word
[59:11] of God and be filled with the spirit
[59:13] that's the end of the church age book
[59:14] that's the whole summation really of his
[59:16] ministry that's what he desired I say
[59:18] Amen to that amen that's what I want to
[59:20] see but you see a you know someone who
[59:22] has a fallen they're actually they're
[59:24] actually worshiping a floored image of
[59:26] themselves they will want to be
[59:27] acknowledged they will want to be
[59:29] Forefront they will want to be you know
[59:31] their Prestige will go before them and
[59:33] you know brother Bram asks a question he
[59:35] says you know when he sees he sees
[59:38] advertising you know the man of the hour
[59:40] the Evangelist Sono is coming to the
[59:42] coming to the city and all these things
[59:44] and he'd say he'd say sometimes he'd say
[59:46] God who are the people coming to see
[59:50] even even his own self he'd say God are
[59:53] they coming to see me or the Evangelist
[59:55] or they coming to see you you you know
[59:57] and I think I think that's the same
[59:59] thing that we need to really you know
[1:00:01] what do we want to impart to people do
[1:00:03] we want to impart our personality do we
[1:00:05] want to impart ourselves to people
[1:00:08] that's that's a religious spirit that's
[1:00:10] an image of a flawed self no we want to
[1:00:12] impart that God would impart himself
[1:00:15] amen that that you know that he would be
[1:00:17] known I'm I'm I'm getting somewhere with
[1:00:19] all this so I just trust you just hold
[1:00:21] on and you know let's just let's just
[1:00:23] keep walking for a bit with you through
[1:00:24] the scriptures so man with was made to
[1:00:26] be a God and because he's now a fallen
[1:00:29] he's now in a fallen State either he
[1:00:31] will be worshiped by someone else or the
[1:00:33] person will worship
[1:00:36] themselves amen amen see there's always
[1:00:39] something that come you know people get
[1:00:41] a a a a a a distorted idea of what a
[1:00:44] Christian should
[1:00:45] be brother Bram would tell a story from
[1:00:49] from uh this is this is from the um
[1:00:51] writings of St Martin he saying that
[1:00:53] there was a bunch of monks in a
[1:00:55] monastery one day day and there was a
[1:00:56] young one of them who was kind of
[1:00:58] irritable you see when someone's
[1:01:00] worshiping an image of a flawed self
[1:01:01] they begin to their their mood changes
[1:01:03] their attitude changes about themselves
[1:01:06] and towards everyone else that Pharisee
[1:01:07] in the temple thought he was the top dog
[1:01:09] oh wow I'm the reason for this Temple
[1:01:11] look how greater I am what he became
[1:01:13] yeah I'm glad I'm not like this guy I'm
[1:01:15] glad I'm not like this family I'm glad
[1:01:16] I'm not like this I'm glad my children
[1:01:18] aren't like these children that's a
[1:01:20] that's an image of a flaw itself he has
[1:01:21] this image in front he's worshiping that
[1:01:24] see and one of them was kind of
[1:01:25] irritable watch this this is a good
[1:01:27] Parable today he wanted to be something
[1:01:30] above the rest of them he wanted to show
[1:01:33] himself Authority bigger something
[1:01:35] something better all class you know a
[1:01:37] great big something he had to be
[1:01:38] classical always wanted the other
[1:01:41] Brethren you know he had to be different
[1:01:43] see he no matter what it was he was very
[1:01:46] arrogant he was the only people on the
[1:01:48] beach there was no one could touch him
[1:01:50] now watch what happened he had to have
[1:01:52] something big he had to compare with the
[1:01:55] big societ you follow me see so he said
[1:01:57] he prophesied he said the Lord has made
[1:01:59] me a prophet also I'm a prophet now
[1:02:02] there was one identified prophet in the
[1:02:04] land that was St Martin he was born a
[1:02:06] prophet but this kid said this young
[1:02:08] fellow said young monk about 25 years
[1:02:10] old he said the Lord has made me a
[1:02:12] prophet I'm going to prove it to you
[1:02:14] said tonight the Lord is going to give
[1:02:16] me a big fine robe put it upon me a
[1:02:18] white robe and sit among you then all of
[1:02:20] you shall come up to me see and you'll
[1:02:22] take orders from me see he had the image
[1:02:26] in his mind this is what he wanted to
[1:02:27] become he wanted to be greater than
[1:02:29] everyone else but they that exalt
[1:02:31] themselves shall be aase right they that
[1:02:33] humble themselves shall be exalted the
[1:02:35] greatest among you should be servant of
[1:02:37] all Lord amen as as our lord Jesus would
[1:02:41] say now see you'll take orders from me
[1:02:45] now compare that today see I'll be the
[1:02:46] head of the organization I'll take care
[1:02:48] of you the rest of you monks and sure
[1:02:50] enough that night lights came on in the
[1:02:52] building so the writings of St Martin
[1:02:54] says read it it's authentic it's history
[1:02:56] and the lights come on all the rest
[1:02:58] watched and here come he had on a white
[1:03:00] robe standing among them he said see I
[1:03:03] told you but that's contrary to the word
[1:03:06] and when he went see isn't that isn't
[1:03:08] that to me it's a very striking
[1:03:10] statement it's contrary to the word so
[1:03:12] you see anyone who's worshiping an idol
[1:03:14] of a flawed self is contrary to the word
[1:03:17] amen their character their nature what
[1:03:19] they say will be contrary it'll be coed
[1:03:21] with the word but it'll be contrary to
[1:03:24] the Worden we'll come to that soon and
[1:03:27] when he went and got the old dean of the
[1:03:29] college he walked up and down a little
[1:03:30] bit said son that doesn't sound right he
[1:03:33] said there's only one way here it is
[1:03:35] there's only one way for us to know it
[1:03:37] looks Supernatural boy Pentecost would
[1:03:39] have grabbed that root Sinker line hook
[1:03:41] and everything else he said the miracle
[1:03:43] may seem all right but it doesn't seem
[1:03:45] right to the word now we have such a
[1:03:47] person an anointed Prophet by the name
[1:03:49] of Martin Come go up before him the guy
[1:03:51] said no no Martin ain't got nothing to
[1:03:53] do with this said you're going anyhow
[1:03:55] and they grabbed him by the arm and they
[1:03:56] took him before man and the robe left
[1:03:59] him yes amen how far along do people
[1:04:02] have to go along before they realize the
[1:04:04] image they've placed in front of them is
[1:04:05] not right like this like how embarrassed
[1:04:09] and how ridiculous this guy would have
[1:04:10] felt but I pray he would have fully
[1:04:12] completely repented and been born again
[1:04:14] after this experience right but you see
[1:04:17] God will allow you to go a certain way
[1:04:19] for you to realize you're worshiping the
[1:04:21] wrong thing amen and so now you see
[1:04:24] we've got to we're just going to jump
[1:04:27] down because the thing is we can live
[1:04:29] such a way that when the mercy of God
[1:04:32] walks in an idol if see an idol will
[1:04:36] never match the word of God Amen an idol
[1:04:39] is already contrary to the word of God
[1:04:41] but an idol can be so big in a person's
[1:04:44] life that's all they see it's like a
[1:04:46] filter that they look through and if it
[1:04:48] doesn't agree with the you if the word
[1:04:51] doesn't agree with that Idol they will
[1:04:53] throw the word away you saw it in the
[1:04:55] life of Jesus you saw it in the book of
[1:04:57] Acts you see it even in this day man has
[1:04:59] a denominational Idol they think this is
[1:05:01] what especially in Jesus's day you can
[1:05:03] bring it today as well this is who
[1:05:05] Christ should be you know they had their
[1:05:07] debates when the Messiah comes he's
[1:05:09] going to come down you know God's going
[1:05:10] to push a button and you stairs is going
[1:05:12] to come down from heaven he's going to
[1:05:13] step out of the clouds and say here I am
[1:05:16] you know I'm come to take over he's
[1:05:17] going to drive the Romans out to sea and
[1:05:19] all these things he's going to be a
[1:05:20] mighty conqueror they had an idea or an
[1:05:22] idol of who the Messiah should be but
[1:05:25] when he came he was born in a manger not
[1:05:28] one of the priests or religious people
[1:05:30] went to see his birth Shepherds went
[1:05:32] there Magi went there different ones but
[1:05:35] you see and then what did he do he is a
[1:05:37] small little Man From
[1:05:39] Galilee but yet it was God and flesh sir
[1:05:42] all that God was was now walking among
[1:05:44] them but you see they had such a such an
[1:05:47] idol of of of who of who God should be
[1:05:51] that they couldn't receive him now if
[1:05:53] you look in the Old Testament there's a
[1:05:55] lot of things where where God speaks
[1:05:56] about high places and Groves now a Grove
[1:06:00] is a is a is a um sacred wood or a Grove
[1:06:03] of trees that have a special religious
[1:06:07] importance within a particular culture I
[1:06:10] say a Grove has to be planted and it's
[1:06:12] got to be cultivated you see those trees
[1:06:15] I don't know how old they are but
[1:06:16] they've been there for a while they
[1:06:18] weren't just planted yesterday so a
[1:06:20] Grove that's been placed in someone's
[1:06:22] heart has been cultivated for years yeah
[1:06:25] it may be something like that man I
[1:06:27] shared that sad testimony of who
[1:06:28] wouldn't get married cuz he didn't want
[1:06:30] to give his parents grandchildren that's
[1:06:32] a Grove that's a cultivated idea that's
[1:06:35] been growing it would have started as a
[1:06:37] small seed but the devil see what
[1:06:39] happens is man man will have self
[1:06:43] fulfilling prophecy in their lives so
[1:06:45] for example they will they will they
[1:06:47] will you know they will um they will
[1:06:50] grow up and they'll get this idea in
[1:06:52] their minds you know no one likes them
[1:06:55] no one wants to be their friend no one
[1:06:57] cares about them and maybe it started
[1:06:58] from just a small thing in their
[1:07:00] childhood but it but it becomes it
[1:07:03] begins to grow it begins to be
[1:07:04] cultivated and it becomes a
[1:07:06] self-fulfilling prophecy where people
[1:07:08] think well no one cares about them no
[1:07:10] one will talk to them no one will spend
[1:07:11] time with them and when they come to
[1:07:13] church they come to church maybe they'll
[1:07:15] come to lunch if they do and if they
[1:07:16] come to lunch they won't join in the
[1:07:18] conversation they won't enter in they
[1:07:20] won't they they won't actually put their
[1:07:22] heart into the
[1:07:23] discussion and so they'll I'll say look
[1:07:26] no one's coming to talk to me but what
[1:07:27] is it it's a self fulfilling prophecy
[1:07:31] what is it it's an idol they'll look
[1:07:33] through everything through that idle of
[1:07:35] No One Cares but yet everyone cares
[1:07:38] that's right you know to me it's amazing
[1:07:39] like you think about it where's Dave
[1:07:43] come here okay here's me no not yet soon
[1:07:45] okay here I am I have this Idol I yeah
[1:07:49] I'm worshiping this idea of this flawed
[1:07:51] self that I'm not no one likes me I got
[1:07:54] nothing to share I got nothing to put
[1:07:56] value in you know no one loves me and
[1:08:00] then and then Here Comes
[1:08:01] Dave here comes the love of God in flesh
[1:08:05] to me
[1:08:07] amen this is Jesus in
[1:08:09] flesh and he comes to speak to me he
[1:08:12] come say how you
[1:08:14] doing say how you doing how you doing
[1:08:17] you know and then maybe I'll just kind
[1:08:18] oh you're good but yet I so I have this
[1:08:22] Idol in my heart no one cares Here Comes
[1:08:25] God's care Here Comes God's love to me
[1:08:28] but yet because this Idol is so great I
[1:08:30] will not allow it to impact
[1:08:33] me thanks bro appreciate that you see
[1:08:37] but but that's how rubber hits the road
[1:08:38] kind of it is think no what God doesn't
[1:08:41] care no one talks to me it's a
[1:08:43] self-fulfilling prophecy and people cut
[1:08:46] themselves off wall themselves away from
[1:08:48] the love of God right cuz imagine that
[1:08:50] if I'm actually open actually no people
[1:08:52] do care that Idol gets smashed down here
[1:08:54] comes Dave the love of God he begins to
[1:08:56] talk to me and that conversation changes
[1:08:58] my whole life amen my whole walk has
[1:09:01] changed my whole life has revolutionized
[1:09:03] why because I opened myself up to the
[1:09:05] love of
[1:09:08] God my amen beautiful you say that
[1:09:11] doesn't happen it happens a lot sadly it
[1:09:14] happens a lot yet the person well I'm a
[1:09:16] Believer you know I've been baptized I
[1:09:18] gave my life to the Lord all these
[1:09:19] things but if I've got that kind of a
[1:09:21] complex in my life because of my part
[1:09:23] you know we can't change our past but we
[1:09:28] can say thank God for the scars thank
[1:09:30] God for your scars thank you for my
[1:09:32] scars Hallelujah you know we can it's
[1:09:34] our perception has to change now you
[1:09:37] look at this you look at this here is
[1:09:39] Simon the
[1:09:40] Pharisee he's invited Jesus Jesus always
[1:09:43] comes where he's invited right the form
[1:09:46] he may come in may be different than
[1:09:47] what you expect he may come in the form
[1:09:49] of there in David hey if Christ is in
[1:09:51] you and I that's that's Jesus coming
[1:09:53] that's Jesus walking on two feet yes sir
[1:09:56] hallelujah amen amen don't you believe
[1:09:59] God lives in you the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:02] Ghost is Christ pouring himself out into
[1:10:04] the body amen so so so so here he is he
[1:10:07] invites the Lord the word steps into his
[1:10:09] house he's not made welcome think it's a
[1:10:12] complex see because Simon the Pharisee
[1:10:15] worshiped his Feast he worshiped what he
[1:10:18] could put on because it became
[1:10:19] prestigious among the community it
[1:10:21] became a yearly event of you know the
[1:10:24] food would get better the entertainment
[1:10:25] would get better and you and the guests
[1:10:28] would become
[1:10:30] more the celebrity it started seist
[1:10:33] celebrity now it was ala celebrity this
[1:10:35] was this was the event you know if you
[1:10:38] got invited to his Feast man you made it
[1:10:40] you and the up and ups but really you're
[1:10:43] in the down and outs because all of them
[1:10:46] could not had such an idol in their
[1:10:49] heart what they thought a prophet should
[1:10:52] be what they thought God would do what
[1:10:55] they thought God how how God would treat
[1:10:59] people because look at this and so so
[1:11:01] Here Comes This Woman This Woman didn't
[1:11:04] have this Idol of a flawed self of a
[1:11:06] religious flawed self this woman just
[1:11:08] knew she needed salvation this this
[1:11:11] woman just knew she needed the love of
[1:11:12] God she needed to be changed she needed
[1:11:14] to know her sins could be washed away
[1:11:17] and she found her way in see if you
[1:11:19] don't have an idol of a flawed self
[1:11:21] there'll be no barrier amen it's just
[1:11:23] you and God and God can talk to you you
[1:11:25] can talk back to him and he can minister
[1:11:27] to you and he can meet your need maybe
[1:11:29] not like this but in time he'll do it
[1:11:31] amen so you can walk with him so she she
[1:11:33] saw she looked in the window and saw
[1:11:35] he's got unwashed feet he's made
[1:11:37] unwelcome how many people make Jesus
[1:11:40] unwelcome in their lives I'm talking
[1:11:42] here I'm not talking out there forget
[1:11:43] out there what about you and I let's put
[1:11:45] the Pitchfork down and say God have I
[1:11:48] made you welcome in my life what 20
[1:11:50] million years ago I did forget 20
[1:11:52] million years ago what about today he
[1:11:54] should be you should be on fire more
[1:11:56] today than you were back then am mean
[1:11:58] you should be so more happy now than you
[1:12:00] were back then when he first found you
[1:12:02] but you see people get this idea of this
[1:12:04] religious Idol and I'm going to get to
[1:12:06] it amen amen so here she comes in
[1:12:09] doesn't have towels for his doesn't have
[1:12:12] a foot washed Basin God supplies the
[1:12:14] tears of repentance amen didn't didn't
[1:12:16] have any perfume you know that that that
[1:12:19] the Pharisee had went and gave all her
[1:12:22] earnings amen and Jesus knew where she
[1:12:24] got it from right but got the be got
[1:12:26] that Alabaster Box off the top shelf ran
[1:12:29] because she knew he must be made welcome
[1:12:31] amen it should be the same thing with
[1:12:33] you and I we something in our heart say
[1:12:34] Lord you must be made welcome I will not
[1:12:36] leave you with unwashed feet in my house
[1:12:39] in my life in my presence I'm going to
[1:12:41] wash your feet Lord hallelujah cuz he's
[1:12:43] been walking through ladyo here and it's
[1:12:45] been a it's a filthy mess of aay Amen so
[1:12:47] there's got to be a place where he can
[1:12:49] have wash feet so she comes in doesn't
[1:12:51] ask permission but she goes right to him
[1:12:53] amen and does him such a service
[1:12:55] what happens now all of these Pharisees
[1:12:57] aren't going
[1:12:59] Hallelujah glory to God someone broke
[1:13:01] through praise the Lord hosana
[1:13:03] salvation's come to your house Simon
[1:13:05] isn't this this is the greatest event
[1:13:08] that's ever happened in this house oh
[1:13:10] Simon imagine if this was put in the
[1:13:12] gospels 2,000 years later people read
[1:13:14] about what happened in your house
[1:13:16] wouldn't you like a testimony like that
[1:13:18] amen where where that your testimony of
[1:13:20] what God did in your house will go
[1:13:22] around the world hallelujah amen
[1:13:25] but you see all of their hearts had an
[1:13:28] idol of a flawed Pharisee religious self
[1:13:32] so when she came in and started and her
[1:13:35] worship when she broke that Alabaster
[1:13:37] Box it filled the whole house it wasn't
[1:13:39] just a dried dyed prayer in the corner
[1:13:42] no it would have changed the whole maybe
[1:13:44] the music stopped all the conversation
[1:13:46] would have stopped and she's keeping on
[1:13:48] going she cuz she doesn't care about
[1:13:50] what they think see an idol of a flawed
[1:13:52] self is what does the other person think
[1:13:54] forget that what does he saying amen
[1:13:57] it's like our lord Jesus well you know
[1:13:59] brother Bram would give a he's not the
[1:14:00] Lord Jesus but brother Bram would give
[1:14:02] an illustration of a man playing a
[1:14:04] violin in front of thousands in a
[1:14:06] concert hall and at the end everyone's
[1:14:08] on their feet giving a standing ovation
[1:14:10] but he's not looking at their Applause
[1:14:12] he knows they enjoy it but he's looking
[1:14:14] up on the balcony to see the master that
[1:14:15] trained him and when he gives the nod
[1:14:19] then he then he acknowledges that why
[1:14:21] because he's been training under his
[1:14:23] tutorship and then the master looks down
[1:14:25] and says what everything I've poured
[1:14:26] into him is now being manifested and
[1:14:29] should be the same thing with the bride
[1:14:30] of Jesus Christ Our Lord Jesus should
[1:14:32] look into our lives and say everything I
[1:14:34] poured into them of love and joy and
[1:14:37] peace and faith and overcoming power and
[1:14:39] victory as being put on flesh in their
[1:14:41] lives Hallelujah so I'm looking for his
[1:14:43] Applause I'm looking for his Amen on my
[1:14:46] life that's the thing that counts amen
[1:14:49] man's ideas you know Micaiah would be
[1:14:51] there in front of 400 prophets and you
[1:14:53] know they had you know that was saying
[1:14:55] before Mah was brought to the meeting
[1:14:57] we're all praying this we're all
[1:14:58] prophesying this if you want to be back
[1:15:00] in Fellowship Mah you better say the
[1:15:02] same thing he wasn't looking for their
[1:15:04] Applause he wasn't looking for their
[1:15:06] acknowledgement he wanted God's
[1:15:07] acknowledgement amen and M is a type of
[1:15:10] you and I the prophet wasn't there but
[1:15:11] Mah was reading the words of Elijah and
[1:15:14] knew it had to be fulfilled aab had to
[1:15:16] fall in battle amen so he wasn't looking
[1:15:18] for there amen he was looking for God's
[1:15:20] amen amen so may we be the same
[1:15:23] way they could not receive what she
[1:15:27] received because of an idol that is the
[1:15:29] one of the saddest scenes I've ever seen
[1:15:31] in my oh it's glorious for her because
[1:15:34] the Lord said thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:15:37] go in peace in other words go in my
[1:15:41] Shalom go in my peace and she walked out
[1:15:44] Justified she came in one way she walked
[1:15:47] out another way they sat in their couch
[1:15:49] scornful they stayed scornful that's
[1:15:51] right amen yet religious and see look at
[1:15:53] this here where where Simon here says
[1:15:56] Behold a woman in the city which was a
[1:15:57] sinner when she knew that uh that Jesus
[1:16:00] sat at meat in the Pharisees house
[1:16:02] brought an alabas the box of ointment
[1:16:04] and stood At His Feet behind him weeping
[1:16:06] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:16:08] that wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:16:09] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:16:11] them with the with the ointment now when
[1:16:13] the Pharisee which had bitten him s it
[1:16:15] he spake within himself saying this man
[1:16:19] if he were a prophet would have known
[1:16:20] who and what manner of woman this is
[1:16:23] that toucheth him for she is a sinner
[1:16:27] the the image of what he thought a
[1:16:30] prophet should
[1:16:32] be was not this it was a false idol in
[1:16:36] his heart his perception wasn't a Godly
[1:16:39] perception because if it was a Godly
[1:16:42] perception he wouldn't be thinking this
[1:16:45] he'd say glory and he would have he
[1:16:47] would have been at at his feet it
[1:16:49] wouldn't have been the footwash flank
[1:16:51] washing jesus' feet he would have been
[1:16:52] the foot wash flank let me wash your
[1:16:54] feet Jesus let me kiss you welcome let
[1:16:57] me anoint you you know can I where's the
[1:16:59] best place in this place for you you
[1:17:01] know let's find you the you know but no
[1:17:03] he had this Idol of a flawed religious
[1:17:06] self in his
[1:17:07] heart so when he came in he couldn't
[1:17:10] accept
[1:17:12] it friends we don't ever want to get to
[1:17:15] a place where God can move he can pour
[1:17:18] His Spirit out service after service
[1:17:20] prayer meeting after prayer meeting and
[1:17:23] it becomes like water offer Duck's
[1:17:26] back because you
[1:17:30] know I'm going
[1:17:31] to we've got to realize that he's the
[1:17:34] same in power and principle and
[1:17:35] everything except he's not here in his
[1:17:37] Corporal body all that he is we can't
[1:17:39] have this perception of this what we
[1:17:42] think a Christian should be and what God
[1:17:43] should be oh he can't do that anymore
[1:17:45] who said oh you can't get it in your
[1:17:48] seat who said are you going come up for
[1:17:50] prayer people preach against prayer
[1:17:51] lines when when did when did Brother
[1:17:54] Bram stop having pray prayer lines Jesus
[1:17:56] met everyone's needs in different ways
[1:17:58] the s a phenician woman came just speak
[1:18:00] you know you know my my daughter is
[1:18:01] grievously vexed with the devil go your
[1:18:03] way your faith has saved her the
[1:18:05] Centurion came just speak the word and
[1:18:07] my servant will be made whole the woman
[1:18:09] touched the him of His Garment you know
[1:18:10] one had to go wash the pool of salom all
[1:18:12] different kinds of ways Jesus met the
[1:18:14] needs of the people and it should be the
[1:18:16] same thing with us people need prayer
[1:18:18] they need prayer they need to be
[1:18:19] anointed be anointed then get in their
[1:18:21] seat we need a prayer line whatever it
[1:18:22] is we have a multi member way that God
[1:18:25] does things so I think we should do it
[1:18:27] the same kind of way we should never
[1:18:28] have a perception in our mind it has to
[1:18:30] be a certain way a certain place at a
[1:18:32] certain time it can be anytime any
[1:18:35] place
[1:18:38] hallelujah amen he says the Lord add His
[1:18:40] blessings through his word now many here
[1:18:42] now just of this just your first night
[1:18:44] I'm uh we're glad you have uh but how
[1:18:47] many here your uh your first timers that
[1:18:50] will say this to God now as the man has
[1:18:53] said you have risen from the dead
[1:18:55] you're not in the Corporal body because
[1:18:57] when that returns to Earth again we'll
[1:18:59] go with him but his Corporal body
[1:19:01] sitting there up in glory but a
[1:19:03] spiritual body in his church amen and by
[1:19:07] that same Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:19:09] his body see so his physical body we're
[1:19:12] going to meet one day in the air that's
[1:19:13] going to be a glorious time but his
[1:19:15] spirit is upon the Earth everything he
[1:19:17] is is here right now apart from his
[1:19:19] Corporal body amen but we never want to
[1:19:22] get to a place where where we think he
[1:19:25] cannot meet our needs or he cannot
[1:19:28] do pardon me that a that a idol become
[1:19:33] such a
[1:19:34] thing that it rules our
[1:19:37] lives possessions power approval Comfort
[1:19:41] success Fame religion entertainment
[1:19:43] yourself pleasure money that yourself
[1:19:45] should be the biggest one in that we
[1:19:48] don't want to this kind of an idol
[1:19:53] now if I can where I am
[1:19:58] here what does this got to do with you
[1:20:00] and
[1:20:01] I it comes into it comes into our lives
[1:20:07] because we look at our humanity and it
[1:20:10] be can become Our God this is the idol
[1:20:13] of a flawed South I'm just kind of
[1:20:14] actually getting to where I want to talk
[1:20:16] now and people love this kind of talk
[1:20:18] like in Romans now this is true I say
[1:20:20] Amen to it for I was alive without the
[1:20:22] law once but when the Commandment came
[1:20:24] sin revived and I died and the
[1:20:26] Commandment which was ordained to life I
[1:20:28] found to be unto death for sin taking
[1:20:31] occasion by the Commandment deceive me
[1:20:33] and by it slew me wherefore the law is
[1:20:35] Holy and the Commandment holy and just
[1:20:37] and good was then uh that which is good
[1:20:40] made death unto me God forbid but sin
[1:20:42] that it might appear working death in Me
[1:20:45] by that which is good that sin by the
[1:20:46] Commandment might become exceedingly
[1:20:49] sinful for we know that the law is
[1:20:51] spiritual but I'm caral sold under sin
[1:20:54] for that which which I do um for that
[1:20:56] which I do I allow not and for that and
[1:20:58] for what I would that do I not for what
[1:21:02] I hate that I
[1:21:04] do if then I do that which I would not I
[1:21:07] consent unto the law that it is good now
[1:21:10] then it is no more that I do it but sin
[1:21:12] that dwelleth in me for I know that in
[1:21:14] me that is that is in my flesh know the
[1:21:18] differentiation here not in the spirit
[1:21:19] and his flesh dwelleth no good thing for
[1:21:21] to will is present with me but how to
[1:21:23] perform that which is good I find not
[1:21:26] for the good that I would do not but the
[1:21:28] evil which I would not that I do now if
[1:21:32] I do now if I do that I would not it is
[1:21:36] no more I that do it but sin that
[1:21:38] dwelleth in me I find in a law that when
[1:21:42] I would do good evil is present with me
[1:21:44] for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:21:46] the inward man but I see another LW in
[1:21:49] my members Waring against the LW of my
[1:21:51] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:21:53] the LW of sin which is in my members oh
[1:21:56] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:21:58] me from the body of this death how many
[1:22:02] people stop there because of a perceived
[1:22:05] deficiency in their own human emotions
[1:22:08] their makeup complexes pains hurts
[1:22:11] problems that they perceive that rule
[1:22:13] them and and they do become something
[1:22:16] that rules what is it now it's an image
[1:22:18] of a flawed self becomes an idol because
[1:22:22] they see well I've got this problem and
[1:22:24] I've got this human Pro this temperament
[1:22:26] and you know I've got this complex and
[1:22:28] I've got this pain and I've got this and
[1:22:30] it becomes something I've I've I've I've
[1:22:32] and it becomes a big thing their whole
[1:22:35] life is actually living through that
[1:22:36] Idol now if you and and people say well
[1:22:39] you know I God allows me to keep this
[1:22:42] just to keep me humble who said that who
[1:22:46] said that yeah when I look into this
[1:22:48] image because this is the mirror we
[1:22:50] should be looking into I mean not an
[1:22:52] idol of our flawed self or what we think
[1:22:54] we
[1:22:55] are this Bible doesn't tell me that I
[1:22:57] should be you know a lot of you know we
[1:23:00] are all Billboards we are advertising
[1:23:03] we're Christian
[1:23:04] advertising we are a living walking
[1:23:06] Track we're a living walking Bible what
[1:23:09] are you advertising you know what
[1:23:12] because remember the proof of the
[1:23:13] product is the life you live right
[1:23:16] that's like any product when it's tested
[1:23:18] and then then it's proven it's not just
[1:23:20] a sales speak that you know Pro
[1:23:22] something it's when it's actually used
[1:23:24] amen amen and so now what kind of Life
[1:23:27] are we living are we living this well
[1:23:30] I've got my problems and my anxiety and
[1:23:33] you know you put up with my humanity and
[1:23:36] you know do you live that kind of a
[1:23:38] Christian Life when the world sees you
[1:23:40] do they want what you have yes sir
[1:23:42] Hallelujah do they really want what you
[1:23:44] have or do they just see rules and
[1:23:46] regulations and well I'll never you know
[1:23:48] a false humility of well you know I'm
[1:23:50] just going through this and i' you know
[1:23:51] my parents were like this and I've got
[1:23:53] this kind of temperament and you know
[1:23:55] this happened to me when I was young and
[1:23:57] talking about those things is all fine
[1:23:59] but you don't want it to become the
[1:24:01] everything in your life that should
[1:24:03] never be our defining thing am amen my
[1:24:06] my first birth is not my identification
[1:24:09] amen it is not my identity you may see a
[1:24:13] man here with a kiwi accent and whatever
[1:24:15] whatever but you know that's not who I
[1:24:17] am amen that that was my first birth God
[1:24:20] used that to get me here I me but before
[1:24:22] I ever got here he put a seed Gene of
[1:24:23] God in my Soul amen and his time
[1:24:26] appointed amen he revealed himself to me
[1:24:28] to show me I'm not from New Zealand amen
[1:24:31] my natural parents I love them to death
[1:24:33] but they they're not my real parent amen
[1:24:37] my heavenly father is my father amen I
[1:24:40] came from God and I go back to God Amen
[1:24:42] so if you major on the negative all the
[1:24:44] time what are you doing it becomes an
[1:24:45] idol it becomes a Grove amen when you
[1:24:48] think I can never overcome this and well
[1:24:50] you know we're in these bodies and you
[1:24:52] know these bodies need to be changed you
[1:24:53] our human spirit needs to be made new
[1:24:55] and all these things you know we can
[1:24:57] live a Victorious life even in these
[1:25:00] bodies I mean we do not need a body
[1:25:02] change to be victorious Jesus did not
[1:25:05] die that we could enjoy the benefits of
[1:25:07] Calvary after the resurrection no he
[1:25:09] wanted you in this Earthly pest house
[1:25:11] that you live in to live a joyful
[1:25:14] overcoming happy wonderful life that's
[1:25:17] what he wants that's what he ordained
[1:25:18] you to be amen he never ordained you to
[1:25:20] be sad and mopy and depressed and down
[1:25:24] and pour me and look at me and this is
[1:25:26] my problem he never ordained you to walk
[1:25:28] that way if you're walking that way
[1:25:30] you've got an idol in front of you and
[1:25:31] it needs to be broken amen because the
[1:25:34] image in front of you should be the word
[1:25:35] of God Amen and the more you Behold Him
[1:25:38] the more you become like him and I've
[1:25:39] never seen a real Christian be be on the
[1:25:42] streets of Glory dancing amen and then
[1:25:44] go down in the dumps and stay there sure
[1:25:47] we may go through valleys but it's a
[1:25:48] trajectory up I mean we can look back
[1:25:51] and say glory to God hallelujah you're
[1:25:53] fully redem me amen I've been washed in
[1:25:55] your blood you made be a new creature
[1:25:57] amen I've got my joy shoes on and I'm
[1:25:59] dancing all my way up into heaven H why
[1:26:02] because the Lord Jesus has redeemed you
[1:26:04] and I amen it's not our Humanity that
[1:26:06] counts who cares about it just just just
[1:26:08] get over yourself get over your humanity
[1:26:11] and walk with God you say but my parents
[1:26:14] are like this and my you know the new
[1:26:16] birth breaks that control of that thing
[1:26:19] the new birth makes you a new creature
[1:26:21] Amen brother B preached he you know he
[1:26:23] mentioned a um he mentioned an interview
[1:26:25] in the message called Paradox and he
[1:26:27] said there was a a parents of a boy that
[1:26:29] was going out with a girl and something
[1:26:31] happened between the boy and the girl
[1:26:33] and and the parents were shocked they
[1:26:35] like how could this be so they bring the
[1:26:37] boy before brother Braham and you know
[1:26:39] brother Braham begins to talk about
[1:26:40] their lineage how one's German one's
[1:26:42] Irish and high tempered and indifferent
[1:26:44] to religion all these different things
[1:26:46] he said but you're not like that you are
[1:26:49] the only two out of your whole families
[1:26:51] that have met the Lord you'll be made
[1:26:52] new cre New Creations and in Christ amen
[1:26:56] and and see you don't have that
[1:26:58] temperament anymore God has changed you
[1:27:00] I mean and that's what God must do sure
[1:27:02] we have some of our temperament we're
[1:27:03] born with but you know he doesn't change
[1:27:05] our temperament but our natural lineage
[1:27:07] does not control us
[1:27:10] anymore praise God and so even and then
[1:27:13] he said your son needs the same thing to
[1:27:15] happen but his father said no he's
[1:27:18] repented he's been baptized in the name
[1:27:20] of Jesus Christ you know he's he's a
[1:27:22] Believer and brother Ram says as far as
[1:27:24] outwardly yes he's a Believer but until
[1:27:27] God comes and changes him I I recommend
[1:27:30] that man that boy never get
[1:27:33] married cuz he will make it
[1:27:36] hell for that girl there must be a
[1:27:39] change you see so we should never be
[1:27:41] focusing you know the gospel see the
[1:27:44] gospel in these days has been reduced
[1:27:47] from a life of Joy Victory and
[1:27:49] overcoming power to a life where we just
[1:27:52] become aware of human py olical problems
[1:27:55] wow that's what this message has been
[1:27:57] reduced to where look at these complexes
[1:28:00] look at these problems look at these
[1:28:01] things that hinder no faith needs to
[1:28:04] come in in a greater measure Faith gives
[1:28:06] us the victory there one thing to
[1:28:08] acknowledge a problem it's another thing
[1:28:10] to make it an idol or to actually make
[1:28:12] it a trophy on your wall cuz God has
[1:28:14] delivered you from it brother R says the
[1:28:15] simplest thing to break a complex is do
[1:28:18] the opposite so if you're way sinking
[1:28:19] you'll never make it you're not worthy
[1:28:21] you you don't mean anything to God you
[1:28:23] no do the opposite it I am worthy
[1:28:25] because of what he's done for me I am
[1:28:27] important to him he died for me on
[1:28:28] Calvary I my soul is worth more than
[1:28:30] 10,000 worlds I me I am not indifferent
[1:28:33] I am not cold you got to you got to
[1:28:34] break that cycle you got to choose by
[1:28:36] yourself see Idols see how many Idols
[1:28:39] did God Smash in the Old Testament using
[1:28:42] human hands come on now Gideon had to
[1:28:44] break the idol in his father's house see
[1:28:46] there's family strains that come down
[1:28:48] that have got to be broken I mean you
[1:28:50] can't let those things that affected
[1:28:51] your fores affect you I mean you because
[1:28:54] if you do you're worshiping an idol of a
[1:28:56] flawed self Hallelujah but you I I
[1:28:59] Believe by the grace of God we can break
[1:29:00] every Idol I mean we can put the right
[1:29:03] image in front of ourselves of joy peace
[1:29:07] love Faith overcoming power
[1:29:11] forgiveness oh but what about all those
[1:29:13] things that happened to me I don't know
[1:29:15] it's for a purpose let God use it amen
[1:29:19] don't don't live a life of self
[1:29:21] fulfilling prophecy like that man I said
[1:29:24] about how he said he'll never get
[1:29:25] married how many women would have come
[1:29:27] up to him and been interested in him and
[1:29:30] how many would he have turned away I
[1:29:32] don't know but there would have been one
[1:29:34] that would have been the one it was
[1:29:37] self-fulfilling prophecy because of what
[1:29:39] is how's parents raised him we're got to
[1:29:42] let those things go you can't change
[1:29:44] your past you can't change what's
[1:29:46] happened none of us can do it you say
[1:29:49] but it was so traumatic that can be true
[1:29:52] amen but let the Lord take it it from
[1:29:54] you let it become a victory let it
[1:29:56] become an overcomer you going to see you
[1:29:58] know look at the thief on the cross he
[1:30:00] did not one day be a good person then
[1:30:03] one day he was on the on the cross the
[1:30:05] only one on the cross that wasn't meant
[1:30:08] to be there was the Lord the other guys
[1:30:10] deserved it even one the one who
[1:30:12] actually got forgiveness said hey stop
[1:30:13] railing on him we deserve to be here
[1:30:16] he's done nothing wrong but God ordained
[1:30:19] his steps to end up there to see the
[1:30:22] lamb doesn't make human sense but what
[1:30:25] it made sense in God's Great economy
[1:30:27] Amen to show it doesn't matter where
[1:30:29] you've come what you've done amen you
[1:30:31] look again and see the blood of the Lamb
[1:30:33] amen it'll change your life am me cuz he
[1:30:35] did not have that image like the
[1:30:37] Pharisees had in their hearts looking at
[1:30:38] the Lord no when he looked again he saw
[1:30:41] the Lord Jesus for who he really was and
[1:30:44] he got
[1:30:46] Mercy his whole life was ordained to end
[1:30:48] up there you say well I've had a bad run
[1:30:52] we've all had a bad run of some degree
[1:30:55] but it's not where you start it's where
[1:30:56] you finish amen amen so I believe that
[1:30:59] we should be a Powerhouse of Joy when
[1:31:01] you really set this because remember the
[1:31:03] Lord Jesus when he looks at you and I
[1:31:05] he's not a wrathful judge amen we we are
[1:31:09] not staring at a at a great white Throne
[1:31:11] judgment that's right remember the Lord
[1:31:13] Jesus took our judgment that day on
[1:31:14] Calvary the Wrath you should have
[1:31:16] received he received amen he gladly bore
[1:31:19] it that day on Calvary that you didn't
[1:31:21] have to go to judgment amen so when he
[1:31:23] looks at you and I he's not an Angry God
[1:31:25] he's not a god of wrath he's not a god
[1:31:27] waiting for you to trip up just to kick
[1:31:29] you down to Hell he's not that kind of a
[1:31:31] God no his eyes are full of Mercy his
[1:31:34] eyes are full of love amen his heart is
[1:31:36] full of grace for you and I amen he
[1:31:38] wants us to make it more than anything
[1:31:40] huj hallelujah amen he wants us to be
[1:31:42] happy he doesn't want us to be you say
[1:31:44] well I'm going through a sad time come
[1:31:47] out of the sad time we have all had sad
[1:31:50] times but don't stay in it I mean don't
[1:31:53] let it become an of well this is just
[1:31:54] how I'm going to be for the rest of my
[1:31:56] life who said that am mean you got to
[1:31:59] realize the reason the Lord Jesus comes
[1:32:00] down in our midst is to really tell us
[1:32:02] of where we're going Amen brother Braham
[1:32:04] said at one place I don't have the quote
[1:32:06] in front of me but when but when the
[1:32:07] three Hebrew children were in the fire
[1:32:10] and the Lord you know there's you know
[1:32:11] brother Brown dramatized it where you
[1:32:13] know wormwood the angel comes up before
[1:32:15] the Throne of heaven and you says Master
[1:32:17] can't you see what they're doing to your
[1:32:19] three three sons down in Babylon they're
[1:32:21] about to throw them in the furnace
[1:32:22] pardon me let me go down I'll drown the
[1:32:24] whole place I'll wipe Babylon off the
[1:32:26] map like I did when you told me to in
[1:32:28] the days of Noah and God said no no
[1:32:30] wormwood you've been a good Angel you've
[1:32:31] done exactly what I've asked you to do
[1:32:33] in the past I can't let you go he stands
[1:32:35] to attention Gabriel comes and draws his
[1:32:37] sword says Master can you not see what
[1:32:40] they're about to do to Shadrach Meshach
[1:32:41] and Abednego they're going to throw them
[1:32:43] in the furnace cuz they've made a stand
[1:32:44] for you he says let me go down there
[1:32:47] I'll just cut all the heads off and one
[1:32:48] go I will absolutely annihilate Babylon
[1:32:52] with one swing of my sword he could have
[1:32:54] done it don't you think so amen but the
[1:32:56] Lord said no Gabriel you've been
[1:32:58] faithful you've been true to me since
[1:32:59] the day I formed you but I can't let you
[1:33:01] go down and then so no doubt the angels
[1:33:03] are wondering them what are you going to
[1:33:05] do he says this is a god-sized job this
[1:33:07] is not an angelized go job this is a
[1:33:10] god-sized job and the wonderful thing
[1:33:12] about shadra Meshach and abedo is they
[1:33:14] had no Idol in their hearts of how God
[1:33:16] should answer them because when when
[1:33:18] they were standing before King
[1:33:19] Nebuchadnezzar you know they said well
[1:33:22] we will not be careful how we're going
[1:33:23] to answer you you our God May Deliver Us
[1:33:26] from the furnace he may not but the sum
[1:33:28] of it is we're not bowing see they did
[1:33:30] not have an idol about how God was going
[1:33:32] to answer they said well if we die we
[1:33:34] die if we don't we don't our lives are
[1:33:36] in God's hands because when we were
[1:33:37] young people when we left Jerusalem we
[1:33:39] said we're going to serve him no matter
[1:33:40] where he takes us and he's brought us to
[1:33:42] this moment he's brought us to this
[1:33:44] predestinated moment amen and they are
[1:33:46] thrown in the furnace and just as they
[1:33:48] were thrown in the furnace the Fourth
[1:33:50] Man stepped in Hallelujah and and
[1:33:53] brother br says that when when the
[1:33:54] fourth man was with Shadrach Meshach and
[1:33:56] abedo he was telling them of their
[1:33:58] future home he was telling about where
[1:34:00] they're going to go to he was telling
[1:34:02] them about what the glories that they
[1:34:04] were going to enjoy when they crossed
[1:34:05] the other side Hallelujah he was
[1:34:07] ministering to them where the end was
[1:34:10] going to be amen and I think the message
[1:34:12] of the hour should be poured into us in
[1:34:14] such a way that we should look at our
[1:34:16] end amen cuz if we see where we're going
[1:34:18] amen these Idols will be smashed am mean
[1:34:20] cuz we'll look beyond the now we won't
[1:34:21] care about the problems in the past and
[1:34:23] the whatever no we will look to where
[1:34:25] we're going because this message has
[1:34:27] called you to a Rapture that's why the
[1:34:29] Lord Jesus died on Calvary to transform
[1:34:31] your bodies Amen to take you into Glory
[1:34:34] Hallelujah that's why he has come amen
[1:34:36] so don't look at the now let it be an
[1:34:38] idol you say well you know I can't take
[1:34:40] correction smash that Idol they say well
[1:34:42] you know I just can't put up with
[1:34:43] anything that's just not according to my
[1:34:45] view smash that Idol if it's according
[1:34:47] to the word receive it in the name of
[1:34:48] Jesus Christ am mean do not let anything
[1:34:51] come between you and God yeah amen
[1:34:54] because otherwise God will walk into the
[1:34:56] room and you won't be able to receive
[1:34:59] him but if these Idols are all gone you
[1:35:01] say
[1:35:02] Lord how how do you want to come do you
[1:35:05] want to come in the form of David Maron
[1:35:07] any one of us do you want to come
[1:35:09] through a song come through Ministry
[1:35:10] come through prayer Hallelujah Lord
[1:35:13] however you come Lord I Want Your
