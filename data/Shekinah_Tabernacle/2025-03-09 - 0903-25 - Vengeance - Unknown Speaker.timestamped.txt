[40:31] Vengeance and we all have that attribute
[40:34] in
[40:36] us so I've just had this you know just a
[40:39] thought I want to I want to take you
[40:40] through it there's a there are quite a
[40:41] few different
[40:43] um facets to this thought I've tried to
[40:45] sort of bring it all together and talk
[40:48] about this thought of um Vengeance this
[40:50] concept of Vengeance you know it runs
[40:52] runs quite deep when we think about it
[40:55] and
[40:57] the general idea of it is that it's
[41:00] punishment infliction or retribution
[41:02] exacted or or done for an injury or a
[41:05] wrong it's kind of like you're you're
[41:08] you're settling the score you know
[41:10] you're getting back at
[41:12] somebody and and and by the time your
[41:14] vengeance is done the scores all settled
[41:16] you know there was a There Was An
[41:17] Unfinished account that was settled
[41:20] after Vengeance takes
[41:24] place now believe it or not the god that
[41:27] we serve this morning as a god of
[41:30] Vengeance very much so there there is
[41:33] not a day that goes by that he's not a
[41:35] fierce fierce God of Vengeance and and
[41:38] it's something very important to
[41:39] understand about about God that you know
[41:41] if we read in nahem chapter 1 ver2 it
[41:44] says God is jealous and the Lord Revenge
[41:48] the Lord revenge and is furious the Lord
[41:52] will take Vengeance on his enemies and
[41:54] he reserve wrath for his enemies
[41:57] this God doesn't play around he's a god
[41:59] of
[42:00] Vengeance and the moment he has to take
[42:02] Vengeance he takes Vengeance furiously
[42:05] there's no half measures there's no
[42:07] holding back it's just
[42:08] vengeance is is is dealt out
[42:12] relentlessly and to the fullest extent
[42:14] of what it needs to be to settle the
[42:16] score and he never plays games he never
[42:18] says Ah you know just take it easy today
[42:21] it's always 100% Furious
[42:25] Vengeance that's actually the god that
[42:26] we Ser you know we we picture the Lord
[42:29] here and sandals and robe and saying you
[42:31] know blessed are the peacemakers which
[42:33] is what he is as well but there's a part
[42:36] of God that's that's 100%
[42:39] Vengeance I want to take you through
[42:41] this just to show how it would happen we
[42:45] take
[42:46] Israel when they were in their land and
[42:48] you know the Lord brought them into the
[42:50] land of you know this land of Israel and
[42:53] then he gave them Commandments to live
[42:55] by and he said okay you do this you do
[42:56] that and it will go well you if you you
[42:58] if you sin you do these other things it
[43:00] would go bad for you like the law and he
[43:01] would govern that law with them himself
[43:04] like he would be the judge of that law
[43:07] over them himself and he wouldn't judge
[43:09] other nations because other nations he
[43:10] didn't place that requirement on them
[43:11] because they weren't his people but his
[43:13] own people he gave them the law and he
[43:14] said right you follow this like my
[43:15] children this is my these are my rules
[43:16] you do well you prosper you don't do
[43:18] well it goes bad okay but the children
[43:21] of Israel often went the other way you
[43:24] know they they turned away from God they
[43:26] broke these laws and then by default
[43:28] they started Living in a manner that
[43:30] wasn't pleasing to the Lord so they went
[43:31] this other
[43:33] way
[43:35] now he didn't take Vengeance on them but
[43:37] I want to show you how it would unfold
[43:39] but to to just to think about this
[43:41] thought this this is a bit of a side
[43:44] thought
[43:45] but when you look at this concept of
[43:47] hate you can understand just through
[43:49] this example that how this concept of
[43:52] hate works and and actually why Satan is
[43:54] a tool in the hands of God as well cuz
[43:56] we we often say it oh Satan's a tall in
[43:58] the hands of God but when you understand
[44:00] how it works you realize he has to be
[44:03] because he is a hater he hates that's
[44:05] what he does his whole life is just his
[44:08] whole being is hate and hate has to do
[44:10] what hate wants to do like if you have
[44:13] hate on you 100% you can't love you know
[44:16] you you would just hate that's just how
[44:18] you would because you can't be something
[44:20] you're not so Satan can't be anything
[44:21] he's not he's he's he's Darkness he's
[44:23] hate right
[44:24] so so now
[44:28] what would then happen
[44:30] was to to God how do I explain it
[44:35] like God is essentially protecting his
[44:38] people in this land right and he'll he's
[44:40] sort of putting a barrier up around the
[44:41] borders if they do well right here's a
[44:43] barrier you do well
[44:45] right
[44:47] now CH let's take this example the
[44:49] children of Israel had people all around
[44:51] them let's say for example one country
[44:53] was one country hated them and one
[44:55] country loved them
[44:57] that were on their borders and let's say
[44:59] God at one point took this protection
[45:01] away from the
[45:03] borders that the two different countries
[45:05] are going to react two different ways to
[45:06] this country called Israel right the
[45:08] country that hates them are going to
[45:10] hate them oh the borders are down we can
[45:12] get in we're going to go and Destroy
[45:14] them no they can't do any they can't do
[45:16] it any other way they are just go to go
[45:18] and hate we'll go rape we'll go pillage
[45:20] we'll go destroy go do whatever we can
[45:22] and for as long as we can cuz that's
[45:24] what's in them but the country that
[45:25] loves them which in their Cas is nobody
[45:27] around there that loves them but just
[45:28] for an example of this even when the
[45:31] borders are up they'll go there and be
[45:32] nice and hey how can we help you you
[45:33] know glad we could be here they will
[45:35] love right so God often times see the
[45:40] minute he lets Satan go somewhere Satan
[45:42] will by default begin to pillage and
[45:44] Destroy he just has to he can't he won't
[45:46] sit back and love ah I'll love these
[45:48] guys I'll build them up in the things of
[45:49] the Lord I'll encourage them to build
[45:50] the temple you know he will go and hate
[45:53] so so why I say that was because in this
[45:55] case
[45:57] in this case he used
[45:58] Babylon when they did wrong he said okay
[46:01] well then as a as a chastisement for you
[46:03] I'm going to take this away from you and
[46:05] now babylon's just going to come in
[46:07] because these people hated them so he
[46:08] knew as soon as I take this protection
[46:10] away that was there they would just come
[46:11] in
[46:12] so so this Babylon of its own desire
[46:16] would come in and start to go in and
[46:19] want to destroy them destroy the temple
[46:21] destroy everything you you're following
[46:23] me very
[46:25] easy and so Babylon at one point came in
[46:28] and they raped and pillaged the land and
[46:29] they took the children of Israel out of
[46:31] the land and over to Babylon it was a
[46:33] traumatic
[46:35] experience when they got over after the
[46:38] course of time now remember Babylonians
[46:41] couldn't do anything but hate they just
[46:43] hated Israel you know now when they were
[46:46] over there the children of Israel at
[46:48] some point in time began to call upon
[46:50] the Lord there's the there's a verse
[46:51] that says by the Rivers of Babylon where
[46:52] we sat down there we wept when we
[46:55] remembered Zion and and and our captives
[46:58] the Babylonians said oh why don't you
[46:59] sing us some of those happy songs of
[47:01] Zion give us some of that give us some
[47:03] of that foot tapping joyful you know
[47:04] Jewish music they said how can we sing
[47:06] in a Strange Land you know and David
[47:09] said if if if I forget Jerusalem let my
[47:12] tongue cling to the roof of my mouth you
[47:13] know that I can't even praise if I
[47:14] forget that's where I'm from that's
[47:16] that's where Joy sits is in that land
[47:19] they say we can't sing those songs and
[47:20] they be to call upon the Lord and say
[47:21] Lord bring us back to the land and they
[47:23] were they were so remorseful and they
[47:24] were they repented they said all we we
[47:26] see what we did wrong and so there was a
[47:28] genuine repentance okay so when this
[47:31] happened and they moved the heart of God
[47:33] then two things begin to
[47:35] happen two things begin to shift the
[47:37] first one is God begins to have mercy
[47:40] from his heart upon his
[47:41] children so so mercy and compassion
[47:44] starts to move because he senses their
[47:47] remorse and he wants to forgive and he's
[47:49] moving that way but then the next thing
[47:52] that's happening while the while the
[47:55] mercy and compassion is is happening One
[47:57] Way vengeance is beginning to build upon
[48:00] Babylon because what did Babylon do hey
[48:03] you guys just you guys are just
[48:05] destroyed my
[48:07] people so Vengeance begins to build you
[48:10] say well you let them do it God say I
[48:12] didn't let you do nothing all I did was
[48:14] open the took the protection away you
[48:16] chose to go in you chose to destroy them
[48:19] I didn't do it you did it so now my
[48:22] Fierce wrath is against you cuz they did
[48:24] nothing wrong to you were just there
[48:27] doing their thing and you just went in
[48:28] there and destroyed them yeah and now
[48:30] you deserve the fullest extent of my
[48:33] Vengeance even though he used them to
[48:35] punish
[48:37] Israel but yet they were still 100%
[48:39] responsible for their actions and they
[48:40] were and they had 100% Fierce vengeance
[48:43] upon them and they were their time was
[48:46] done and the more Israel called upon the
[48:48] Lord the more there was
[48:50] Vengeance brewing in the heart of God
[48:52] towards Babylon he said I'm going to
[48:54] finish you completely that's why he said
[48:56] flee out of the midst of Babylon and
[48:58] deliver Every Man's Soul be not cut off
[49:01] in her iniquity for this is the time of
[49:02] the Lord's Vengeance he will render
[49:04] under her
[49:06] recompense he says make bright the
[49:08] arrows gather the shields the Lord hath
[49:10] raised up the spirit of the kings of the
[49:11] mes for his device is against Babylon to
[49:14] destroy it because it is the Vengeance
[49:16] of the Lord and the Vengeance of his
[49:18] Temple these guys went and destroy my
[49:20] temple they got Vengeance I'm going to
[49:22] destroy them he says therefore thus
[49:25] sayith the Lord the Lord of behold I'll
[49:27] plead thy cause and take Vengeance for
[49:29] thee and I will dry up her sea and make
[49:31] her Springs dry I'm going to finish that
[49:35] woman and and and that's what God did he
[49:38] destroyed Babylon because he took
[49:40] vengeance upon them because he's a god
[49:42] of Vengeance he doesn't just oh well you
[49:43] know yeah you know what you had every
[49:46] right to go in there I suppose they were
[49:47] being bad no you had no right to touch
[49:50] them
[49:53] now men and women being like how we are
[49:56] we're like amateur God so we actually if
[49:57] we were honest with ourselves we like
[50:03] Vengeance and we like stories of
[50:05] Vengeance ah I got them back you know
[50:07] that's in a sense that's part of our
[50:12] makeup now I'm not saying it's correct
[50:15] I'm just saying that's we're like God
[50:16] and we do have an ATT we we do have an
[50:18] attribute in us that likes to take
[50:20] Vengeance
[50:21] right but get to it later on I've just
[50:24] got some stories of vengeance
[50:27] there's a group called The it's probably
[50:29] n n nakam and these These are these are
[50:32] men that went through the um
[50:34] concentration camps survivors and when
[50:37] they got out there was about 50 of them
[50:38] they formed this group and they were
[50:39] going to take revenge for the Holocaust
[50:41] that was their plan and and they were
[50:45] indiscriminate of who they killed or how
[50:47] they would go about this they just
[50:48] wanted to kill as many Nazis as many of
[50:50] these people as they could they didn't
[50:51] care what who else they killed in the
[50:53] process or what happened they would just
[50:55] after as many Nazis as they could to
[50:58] kill them right so the first plan they
[51:00] had was um this was the leader of the
[51:02] group ABA kova hatched a hatch plan a to
[51:05] poison the water supply of nurg w
[51:07] Hamburg and Frankfurt and Munich but he
[51:10] was caught and had to Chuck the poison
[51:12] before he could initiate the plan so he
[51:13] was prepared to to poison the whole
[51:15] water system of all these cities to try
[51:18] and destroy a few Nazis he wouldn't care
[51:20] if he just killed half of the Jima
[51:23] population because these guys had so
[51:24] much Vengeance in them they hated what
[51:27] happened to them and they just wanted
[51:29] Vengeance they they made a pack we're
[51:30] going to take Vengeance the next one
[51:32] Plan B that didn't work so plan B um the
[51:35] na targeted German prisoners of War held
[51:37] by the United States by poisoning bread
[51:39] with arsenic they targeted bakeries that
[51:41] Supply prisons and poison 3,000 loaves
[51:44] of bread targeting more than 12,000 Nazi
[51:46] prisoners more than 2,000 German peer WS
[51:49] were seconded but no deaths resulted
[51:51] from the attack
[51:52] disappointing so
[51:54] disappointing back to the drawing board
[51:56] you
[51:58] know but they had Vengeance they just
[52:01] wanted to take Vengeance here's another
[52:03] one operation wrath of God this is
[52:05] another Israeli a Jewish one this is
[52:08] actually quite a the bad one this is
[52:10] during the Olympics of
[52:11] 1972 the like a Palestinian group took
[52:16] the Israeli Olympic team hostage and
[52:19] they ended up killing um I think it was
[52:21] 11 of the Israeli um Olympic
[52:25] team and and it was It was kind of it
[52:27] was almost broadcast live on the news as
[52:29] it was happening and things like that
[52:30] but you can imagine the Israeli
[52:32] government was so furious at what had
[52:34] happened and they had such they wanted
[52:37] to meet Vengeance they wanted Vengeance
[52:39] to happen upon these people because they
[52:42] essentially shamed them in front of the
[52:43] world and killed their Olympic team and
[52:46] so they had the whole government had
[52:48] this Fierce sense of Vengeance that they
[52:50] launched this operation called operation
[52:52] wrath of God what they called it to to
[52:55] settle the score these people and it
[52:58] says Wrath of God's goal was fairly
[53:00] simple it assassinate the members of the
[53:02] Palestinian armed militant group Black
[53:04] September and others within the
[53:05] Palestinian liberal Liberation
[53:07] Organization the op was author was
[53:09] authorized by Israeli Prime Minister
[53:11] Goldie m in the Autumn of 1972 and is
[53:14] believed to have been carried out for
[53:16] two decades 20 years they're meeting out
[53:21] Vengeance
[53:23] um the mosed was was brutal in
[53:27] delivering its Vengeance against the
[53:28] perpetrators of the Munich Massacre when
[53:31] they closed it on a Target they sent a
[53:32] letter to the family of the deceased
[53:34] hours before carrying out an
[53:35] assassination the letters read a
[53:37] reminder we do not forget or forgive
[53:41] that's how Fierce their Vengeance was it
[53:44] was just going to go on and on till they
[53:46] doubt to every last person they could
[53:48] find that was part of this for 20 years
[53:51] pass on the mantle you're in the
[53:52] government next remember
[53:54] Vengeance okay one of them clst at a
[53:56] home here was called um if you may may
[53:59] not have heard this the burning of the
[54:00] bo which was in the B of islands in um
[54:02] 1805 I think it was so this was a um uh
[54:07] it was actually a Timber merchant ship
[54:09] that had come into up north and they
[54:11] were coming in to get big long Cody um
[54:15] Timber and Export it they bring it
[54:20] overseas on the ship was a young moldy
[54:23] boy and he was the son of a chief that
[54:25] was from there and they they may gone
[54:26] around the world and come back and
[54:29] um for whatever reason they don't know
[54:31] but this moldy boy didn't want to do
[54:33] much work I think being a son of a a
[54:34] chief he thought no there's below me or
[54:36] something and he didn't really cooperate
[54:38] so they ended up the people on the ship
[54:40] mistreated him really badly and whipped
[54:41] him and flogged him had him locked up
[54:43] and you know for a long big big part of
[54:45] this journey and so when he got back to
[54:50] his home he went to Shore and he told
[54:51] his father who was the chief of what
[54:53] they' done to him on the ship and so
[54:55] these men
[54:57] were um unsuspecting of what had
[55:00] happened with The Moldy boy Chief when
[55:03] he went in and told them so the captain
[55:05] and a few of the other men went into
[55:06] Shore to to go up a valley and have a
[55:08] look at some big Cody trees which were
[55:10] massive thousand year old trees to cut
[55:12] down
[55:13] and they I think they didn't get far
[55:16] past the shore cuz they got killed and
[55:19] eaten yeah probably a little bit skinny
[55:22] but
[55:27] you've been on a ship for a while you're
[55:28] quite skinny you know should have fatten
[55:30] them up for a while
[55:32] sorry so then so they killed and eight
[55:35] these these people and then later on
[55:37] they disguised themselves as that party
[55:39] and they came back to the ship with the
[55:41] intention of Revenge cu the chief wanted
[55:43] to take revenge on this on this captain
[55:46] and on every everyone in that ship there
[55:48] were men women children in there so they
[55:51] they went back to the ship the main with
[55:53] you know disguised as the the captain
[55:55] the people that left they went back
[55:56] there and then on the command they
[55:58] attacked the ship and all the other
[56:00] boats the Walkers that around went in
[56:01] and they they they ransacked the ship um
[56:06] all night just and killed a lot of
[56:08] people and there were survivors hanging
[56:09] off the side and everything the next day
[56:11] this Chief here turned up um TPI was his
[56:16] name and he tried to stop what was going
[56:18] on because he was friendly towards the
[56:20] Europeans they actually all were till
[56:22] they mess with the chief's son but they
[56:26] got rid of him and um continued to kill
[56:30] as many as they
[56:32] could funny
[56:34] enough this is just sometimes how I
[56:36] guess
[56:37] the rewards are met they towed the ship
[56:42] it sort of mored or I guess it beached
[56:44] up on the on the mud flats and they
[56:46] began to take all the gunpowder and
[56:47] different things out but one of the a
[56:49] piece of flint lit and it set the
[56:51] gunpowder a light and this whole ship
[56:53] blew up and the one person that died di
[56:56] in that particular explosion was the
[56:58] chief's uh the son the was the chief the
[57:01] man that had sort of orchestrated the
[57:02] whole idea of Vengeance he got blown up
[57:05] there and died um and incidentally there
[57:09] were only a few survivors one was a
[57:11] mother and a baby and another one was a
[57:12] baby and there was one one boy he was
[57:15] the cabin boy that survived and they
[57:17] didn't kill him because when the young
[57:21] um chief's son was in prison he would go
[57:25] and bring him food after him so he he
[57:27] looked after this boy and so his life
[57:30] was sped he never never died the cabin
[57:32] boy but word of this got around the
[57:34] world of this Vengeance that the these
[57:36] moldy people had taken upon the ship and
[57:38] that and and there were plans for for
[57:40] the gospel to come here and different
[57:42] things to happen but they all got put on
[57:43] hole because they thought we're not
[57:44] going to go there to that bunch of
[57:45] cannibal Killers you know so the the
[57:48] whole thing got put off by years and
[57:49] years maybe 10 years no one wanted to
[57:50] come here and it got a bad reputation
[57:53] but I don't know if you remember me
[57:54] talking about it but there was a guy
[57:55] Samuel and he always wanted to come here
[57:57] and share the gospel and he always
[57:58] thought of the event differently he
[58:00] thought no I want to hear their side of
[58:01] the story because I don't perceive these
[58:03] people just to be Killers like that they
[58:04] don't just go and kill for no reason so
[58:06] he wanted to go and find out why did
[58:07] they want to take this Vengeance it
[58:08] sounds like Vengeance to me so he he he
[58:12] was delayed because he couldn't get
[58:14] support to come over here because people
[58:15] said we're not we're not funding any
[58:16] trip to go over there um but eventually
[58:19] maybe 10 years later he arrived back
[58:21] here and then he made peace between the
[58:24] two tribes the and then
[58:26] I just wanted to say this because I just
[58:28] like the first when he came and preached
[58:31] he came he preached up from the Bay of
[58:32] islands but it was on Christmas Day
[58:34] 18:14 and he said behold I bring you
[58:36] Glad Tidings of great joy I just always
[58:39] like that that was the first I guess the
[58:40] first time there was a a a sermon
[58:43] preached in New Zealand it was and that
[58:44] was the opening line behold I bring you
[58:47] Glad Tidings of great
[58:50] joy now when we talk about the
[58:53] attributes of God we can say that God
[58:55] has shared a lot of his attributes with
[58:57] us right he's he said a lot of what I am
[58:59] I can I'll give to you to you be like me
[59:02] you know I'm this I'm that so so he says
[59:04] things like verily I say unto you he
[59:05] that believeth on me the works that I do
[59:07] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[59:08] these shall he do because I go to my
[59:10] father the things I do you're going to
[59:12] do I'm going to share them with you
[59:13] you'll become you'll be like me right so
[59:15] he says uh you'll you'll heal the sick
[59:17] you know you'll cleanse the lepers
[59:18] you'll raise the dead you'll cast out
[59:20] Devils freely you have received freely
[59:23] give you can have these attributes that
[59:24] I am you you can begin to do them it's a
[59:26] um you know in my name you'll cast out
[59:28] Devils you'll speak with new tongues
[59:29] you'll take up serpents and if you drink
[59:31] any deadly thing it won't hurt you
[59:33] you'll lay hands on the sick they shall
[59:34] recover he's he's passing all of his
[59:36] attributes on to us but the one thing he
[59:39] never shed with us was
[59:40] Vengeance he never said you can take you
[59:42] can have my Vengeance he never shared
[59:45] Vengeance
[59:47] never that's why he said oh Lord God to
[59:50] whom Vengeance belongeth oh God to whom
[59:52] Vengeance belongeth show thyself amen
[59:55] and he even said says in Deuteronomy to
[59:57] me belongeth Vengeance and recompense
[59:59] their foot shall slide in due time for
[1:00:01] the day of their Calamity is at hand and
[1:00:03] the things that shall come upon them
[1:00:05] make haste and Romans it says dearly
[1:00:08] beloved avenge not yourselves but rather
[1:00:09] give Place unto wrath for it is written
[1:00:12] vengeance is mine I will repay sayith
[1:00:15] the Lord so never ever authorized man to
[1:00:18] have Vengeance he never gave Vengeance
[1:00:20] to anybody he said vengeance is mine so
[1:00:23] essentially actually to take Vengeance
[1:00:25] like all these men did they were wrong
[1:00:26] cuz that Vengeance Belongs to the Lord
[1:00:28] and he never shared it with us never
[1:00:30] gave it to us and and as a matter of
[1:00:32] fact we're actually we're actually
[1:00:34] taught to suffer wrong rather than take
[1:00:37] Vengeance we're supposed to say oh it's
[1:00:39] okay and and not take Vengeance back
[1:00:43] right now but that doesn't mean there's
[1:00:46] no
[1:00:46] Vengeance you got to understand we serve
[1:00:49] a god of vengance so if we don't take
[1:00:52] Vengeance mark my words somebody will
[1:00:59] see what happens when you do that like
[1:01:01] this here therefore if eny hunger feed
[1:01:05] him if he thirst give him drink now it's
[1:01:09] not just to make the man feel good or
[1:01:10] the woman feel good whatever it might be
[1:01:11] I'm not saying to people whatever it
[1:01:13] might be but it's very powerful because
[1:01:15] he says in doing so you'll put you'll
[1:01:17] heat coals of fire upon his head why cuz
[1:01:22] there's an unsettled score
[1:01:26] and and and somebody is going to have
[1:01:28] take Vengeance and settle that
[1:01:30] score somebody and I know who it's going
[1:01:33] to be if you if you uh give up that
[1:01:38] opportunity it doesn't go that score
[1:01:40] just doesn't stay unsettled you
[1:01:43] understand that God's a faithful God of
[1:01:45] Vengeance he's going to take Vengeance
[1:01:47] absolutely that's why the Bible says
[1:01:49] it's a fearful thing to fall into the
[1:01:51] hands of the Living
[1:01:53] God because a man can can suddenly he
[1:01:56] find himself I'm in the hands of the
[1:01:57] Living God because I've got Vengeance
[1:01:59] from God coming upon
[1:02:02] me we a man and woman can end up in that
[1:02:04] situation where they've fallen into the
[1:02:06] hands of the Living God it's a fearful
[1:02:08] thing we I've got a verse for that
[1:02:10] shortly you remember the arish massacre
[1:02:13] when that that um truck driver went and
[1:02:16] and um took ended up taking maybe 20 of
[1:02:19] these young girls hostage in that little
[1:02:22] single room armish Schoolhouse in
[1:02:24] Pennsylvania he was a very warped man
[1:02:27] and he hated God and things like that
[1:02:28] and um and he and he he wanted to rape
[1:02:32] and do things um so he he ended up
[1:02:35] taking all these girls
[1:02:37] hostage and sent all the teachers and
[1:02:40] all the boys out and had all sorts of
[1:02:42] awful plans but it kind of just
[1:02:45] eventuated a different way and he ended
[1:02:46] up killing I think it was 11 of these
[1:02:47] arish school girls before he shot
[1:02:50] himself and
[1:02:52] um word of the spread around the world
[1:02:55] like
[1:02:57] wildfire and they say it wasn't so much
[1:03:00] because it was a shooting a school
[1:03:02] shooting because there were plenty of
[1:03:03] school shootings there weren't really
[1:03:04] that common in 10 you know only 10 not
[1:03:08] that it was small but I think the reason
[1:03:10] why it spread around the world because
[1:03:11] they were like well even the armor
[1:03:12] schools are not safe from this you know
[1:03:14] you think oh inner city schools you know
[1:03:16] yeah people got shoot up there but an
[1:03:17] armor school you know of all places You'
[1:03:19] think wouldn't happen there so it became
[1:03:22] an a a
[1:03:23] worldwide uh
[1:03:26] event like it it everyone knew about it
[1:03:28] but the armish did something unusual in
[1:03:31] their response was that from the get-go
[1:03:36] because they believe that we don't take
[1:03:37] Vengeance we we it's not given to us to
[1:03:40] take Vengeance it's given to us to
[1:03:43] forgive that's what we've been told to
[1:03:45] do not take Vengeance so their response
[1:03:48] from day one was we hold nothing against
[1:03:50] this man that killed all of our children
[1:03:53] we forgive him we don't take Vengeance
[1:03:57] we wish him all the best he's dead but
[1:04:00] more so we feel sorry for his wife and
[1:04:02] his
[1:04:03] children uh and to the point where they
[1:04:07] the the world flooded money to the
[1:04:09] Amish in in terms of gifts and that they
[1:04:11] they flooded money to them they took
[1:04:13] some of that money and gave it to the
[1:04:14] Widow and the children of the deceased
[1:04:16] man to help her in her troubles what she
[1:04:18] was going through and when they had the
[1:04:21] funeral there were about there were 70
[1:04:24] people at the funeral of this man that
[1:04:26] was the killer 40 of them were his
[1:04:29] family and 30 of them were arish to
[1:04:32] support the the woman than the children
[1:04:36] you know and
[1:04:38] and and the world couldn't comprehend
[1:04:41] the response because the world is used
[1:04:44] to Vengeance they're used to used to the
[1:04:47] the victims the survivors whoever coming
[1:04:49] out saying you know I I hate that man I
[1:04:52] hope he burns in hell you know that
[1:04:54] they're used to that response not used
[1:04:55] to we responsive I have mercy I forgive
[1:04:58] in the face of such a traumatic
[1:05:00] experience like You' just
[1:05:01] killed 11 little girls in our small
[1:05:04] tight knit Circle Our Lives will never
[1:05:06] be the same again and yet we forgive and
[1:05:08] and the the mother the wife of this man
[1:05:11] was so touch he said your love for our
[1:05:13] family has helped provide the healing we
[1:05:15] so desperately need gifts you have given
[1:05:17] have touched our hearts in a way no
[1:05:20] words can describe your compassion has
[1:05:21] reached beyond our family beyond our
[1:05:24] community and is changing our world and
[1:05:26] for this we sincerely thank you I me you
[1:05:29] to say that if they hadn't have done
[1:05:31] that response you wouldn't be hearing
[1:05:32] this
[1:05:33] today it would have just it would have
[1:05:35] just gone down and been a little blip on
[1:05:37] the radar but because of their response
[1:05:40] even years and years later people are
[1:05:41] still talking about it films being made
[1:05:43] about it of their response which was not
[1:05:47] Vengeance
[1:05:49] forgiveness people debated it on talk
[1:05:51] shows should they have done that should
[1:05:53] they have had mercy right they should
[1:05:55] have had vengeance they debated it it
[1:05:57] was such a powerful
[1:05:58] thing but now that man is gone now
[1:06:03] but even in these circumstances there's
[1:06:05] no account that goes unsettled if you if
[1:06:07] you forgive and suffer wrong it doesn't
[1:06:10] remain unsettled just want to assure you
[1:06:12] of
[1:06:13] that second Thessalonians says so that
[1:06:17] we ourselves glory in you and the
[1:06:20] Churches of God for your patience in
[1:06:21] faith and all your persecutions and
[1:06:23] tribulations that you endure which is a
[1:06:25] manif token of the righteous Judgment of
[1:06:27] God that you may be counted worthy of
[1:06:28] the kingdom of God for which you also
[1:06:30] suffer seeing it as a righteous thing
[1:06:32] with God to recompense tribulation to
[1:06:34] them that trouble you
[1:06:37] righteous and you who are troubled rest
[1:06:39] with us when the Lord Jesus shall be
[1:06:41] revealed from heaven with his mighty
[1:06:42] angels and flaming fire taking Vengeance
[1:06:45] on them that know not God and that obey
[1:06:47] not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] who shall be punished with Everlasting
[1:06:51] destruction from the presence of the
[1:06:52] Lord and from the glory of his power
[1:07:00] Vengeance and this is the verse here for
[1:07:02] we know him that has said Vengeance
[1:07:05] belongeth unto me I will recompense
[1:07:06] sayith the Lord and again the Lord shall
[1:07:08] judge his people that's why he says it
[1:07:11] is a fearful thing to fall into the
[1:07:12] hands of the Living God to find
[1:07:14] ourselves on the receiving end of
[1:07:16] Vengeance and if we even as a Christian
[1:07:19] maybe potentially could
[1:07:21] we there's only one anomaly I suppose
[1:07:25] this concept of who he's given it to is
[1:07:27] that he actually has given it to
[1:07:30] governments he's actually authorized
[1:07:32] governments that they can meet out
[1:07:35] Vengeance where it's
[1:07:36] needed there's a verse in um and this is
[1:07:39] this is the exception on this this
[1:07:41] concept it says submit yourselves to
[1:07:43] every ordinance of man for the Lord's
[1:07:44] sake whether it be to Kings as supreme
[1:07:46] or Governors as unto them that are sent
[1:07:49] by him for the punishment of evildoers
[1:07:52] and for the praise of them that do well
[1:07:55] so he's actually said yeah but there's
[1:07:56] one exception because we're men and
[1:07:58] women and we've got a society and things
[1:08:00] have to happen a certain way he's
[1:08:01] realized okay well I have to authorize a
[1:08:03] certain in a certain system that yes you
[1:08:06] may take Vengeance and he's Vengeance in
[1:08:09] a way you can meet out a punishment for
[1:08:12] something and now some governments go
[1:08:15] corrupt and everything but generally
[1:08:16] speaking we all have this concept we
[1:08:18] want a good government that will take
[1:08:19] Vengeance on someone's wronged me I can
[1:08:22] go to the government they did wrong to
[1:08:24] me and then the the government comes in
[1:08:27] and and takes Vengeance throws that
[1:08:29] person in prison does something they
[1:08:30] they they have Vengeance on my on
[1:08:32] someone that wronged me
[1:08:34] right that's how that's how it works
[1:08:36] like like if we didn't have if we didn't
[1:08:39] have that Concept in society society
[1:08:40] would be just chaos but the Lord has
[1:08:43] actually given that concept to man said
[1:08:45] the governments can actually can uh
[1:08:49] Implement Vengeance
[1:08:51] right that's why you can't have this
[1:08:53] thing called vigilante justice which is
[1:08:55] where if you wrong me I go and I can
[1:08:59] break the law to get you back if you
[1:09:02] break like if you come and hurt me
[1:09:05] you're wrong but I can't come the next
[1:09:07] day with a bat and beat you to get you
[1:09:11] back for what you did for
[1:09:12] me because I'm I'm not under the law I
[1:09:16] can't take vengeance upon you but the
[1:09:17] law can I can go to the law and say uh
[1:09:19] this guy beat me with a bat the other
[1:09:21] day you know here's my mark and here's
[1:09:22] this and they take fish into the court
[1:09:25] say F did you beat him with a
[1:09:26] [Laughter]
[1:09:28] B yeah but I didn't like how he talked
[1:09:30] to me at music
[1:09:33] practice I'm tired of it man I'm
[1:09:36] done and I have to and then the law will
[1:09:40] implement the
[1:09:41] Justice
[1:09:43] right this case here was um uh this was
[1:09:46] a Texas dad he he a man was trying to
[1:09:50] rape his 5-year-old daughter and he beat
[1:09:52] this man to death but he got off that
[1:09:54] crime
[1:09:56] only because he found he was he caught
[1:09:58] them in the ACT he caught this man in
[1:09:59] the act and they they argued and said
[1:10:01] well he used reasonable Force to protect
[1:10:04] his daughter the man didn't die then but
[1:10:06] he died of his wounds not long
[1:10:07] afterwards like whatever he but he tried
[1:10:09] to save him he told the noal mon can you
[1:10:11] guys get here this guy's dying but but
[1:10:14] they so they they didn't allow because
[1:10:16] the government can never allow vigilante
[1:10:17] justice they could never do that because
[1:10:19] it would undermine what they actually
[1:10:20] what they there for they can never say
[1:10:22] yeah fair enough bad man raping your
[1:10:24] daughter yet kill him they can never do
[1:10:26] that as much as we as Society want them
[1:10:28] to well just hey that man was wrong and
[1:10:30] he was right you know but they can't
[1:10:32] ever say CU that would undermine their
[1:10:35] whole the their whole structure but and
[1:10:38] it wouldn't be Godly either and they
[1:10:39] can't do it because God set up the
[1:10:41] system do you understand what I mean
[1:10:42] right so but in this case they said look
[1:10:44] it was reasonable Force to save her
[1:10:46] because you caught them in the a so that
[1:10:49] wasn't vigilante justice in terms of you
[1:10:51] tracked him down a week later and killed
[1:10:52] him that would have been different right
[1:10:55] one person that did was this lady Maran
[1:10:58] Bak German so her quite her daughter was
[1:11:02] maybe 12 13 she got raped by someone
[1:11:04] that she knew and it was during her the
[1:11:07] court um trial she actually went in
[1:11:10] there with a had it snuck in there like
[1:11:13] the third or fourth day whatever it was
[1:11:14] with a a gun in her overcoat and you
[1:11:18] know when the guy walked in she went
[1:11:19] there and shot like six or seven rounds
[1:11:21] at this man and killed him and now the
[1:11:24] whole world was saying look fear fear
[1:11:26] game you know the guy raped his daughter
[1:11:28] all Fe raped her daughter all fear but
[1:11:30] she still went to prison for that
[1:11:31] because it's like well you we were busy
[1:11:35] implementing Vengeance and you just took
[1:11:36] it yourself what didn't belong to you so
[1:11:39] they rightfully so put her in prison
[1:11:43] because if she had waited that he would
[1:11:44] have got his his time and the thing with
[1:11:47] vigilante justice it denies the right of
[1:11:49] the other person will fear trial too
[1:11:51] there may be confusion you know is that
[1:11:53] all right okay
[1:11:56] I just wanted to cover that because when
[1:11:57] you talk about vengeance there is still
[1:11:58] a certain amount that get meat here
[1:12:00] right okay I want to turn to this one
[1:12:02] turn to
[1:12:05] um what's the password on this
[1:12:08] bro there you go people you
[1:12:14] know I want to come back here and
[1:12:17] um turn this a little bit I want to talk
[1:12:20] about the City of
[1:12:21] Refuge now when the children of Israel
[1:12:24] when when the lamb was set up the Lord
[1:12:26] knew there'd be situations where there
[1:12:27] needed to be a place where a man or a
[1:12:29] woman could go if they were if they done
[1:12:31] wrong but they they they would not it
[1:12:34] was a mistake or something could
[1:12:35] happened a place where they could go to
[1:12:36] to Escape right it was called the City
[1:12:38] of Refuge and and the Lord set up six of
[1:12:41] these places he designated six in Israel
[1:12:43] he said speak unto the children of
[1:12:44] Israel and say unto them when you come
[1:12:45] over into Jordan into the land of Canaan
[1:12:47] then shall you appoint then shall then
[1:12:50] you shall appoint you cities to be
[1:12:52] Cities of Refuge for you that the Slayer
[1:12:54] May flee thither which kth any person at
[1:12:56] unawares like by mistake and they shall
[1:12:58] be unto you cities for Refuge that the
[1:13:01] for Refuge from the Avenger that the man
[1:13:04] slay die not until he stand before the
[1:13:06] congregation in judgment so he could
[1:13:09] flee to one of these cities one of these
[1:13:10] six cities there was one either side of
[1:13:12] the the river uh three either side of
[1:13:14] the river now the the first rule was if
[1:13:17] you murder someone you die so you try
[1:13:19] and get into City good luck you know he
[1:13:22] said because that's what this one here
[1:13:23] says but if he has thrust him of hatred
[1:13:24] or H at him by lying in waight has
[1:13:27] planned that he die or an enity Smite
[1:13:29] him with his hand that he die he that
[1:13:31] smot him shall be put to death for he is
[1:13:33] a murderer the Revenger of blood shall
[1:13:35] slay the murderer when he meeteth
[1:13:38] him real simple he ain't making it the
[1:13:40] no City because he's guilty okay now but
[1:13:45] if it's an accident then you can run to
[1:13:47] the City of
[1:13:48] Refuge because it says but if he thrust
[1:13:50] him suddenly without enity or have cast
[1:13:52] upon him anything without laying of
[1:13:54] weight or with any stone wherewith a man
[1:13:56] may die seeing him not like an accident
[1:13:58] and cast it upon him that he die and was
[1:14:02] not his enemy neither sought his harm
[1:14:04] then the congregation shall judge
[1:14:05] between the Slayer and the Revenger of
[1:14:07] blood according to these judgments and
[1:14:09] the congregation shall deliver the
[1:14:11] Slayer out of the hand of the Revenger
[1:14:13] of blood and the congregation shall
[1:14:15] restore him to the city of his
[1:14:19] Refuge whether he was fled and he shall
[1:14:21] abide in it unto the death of the high
[1:14:23] priest which was anointed with the Holy
[1:14:26] oil so in a sense they kind of get there
[1:14:28] then they have a judgment whether they
[1:14:30] can stay there or not if they're guilty
[1:14:32] throw them out they Avenger murders them
[1:14:34] not murder you'd say kill right but if
[1:14:37] yes it was an accident you didn't mean
[1:14:39] to kill that person then they may have
[1:14:41] been judging them in some other town but
[1:14:43] they would send them back to the City of
[1:14:44] Refuge that they first turned up in and
[1:14:46] the the and the agreement was that you
[1:14:48] will stay there until the death of the
[1:14:50] current high priest when he dies you're
[1:14:51] free it's quite a neat way how God did
[1:14:53] it because he then he designs
[1:14:55] I only want you to be in there for one
[1:14:57] year other people may be 40
[1:14:59] years it depends how long the high
[1:15:01] priest was alive for you know someone
[1:15:03] may have been one day priest dies that
[1:15:05] same day well that was short it doesn't
[1:15:07] matter that was what the Lord had
[1:15:09] designated it's not like oh you got a 20
[1:15:10] year sentence it's like it's as it's as
[1:15:12] long as what I think is going to work in
[1:15:14] my whole scheme because I want you to be
[1:15:15] out somewhere and do whatever you do
[1:15:17] right that's why it says but if the
[1:15:19] Slayer but if the Slayer shall any time
[1:15:20] come within the border of the City of
[1:15:22] Refuge whether he was fled and there
[1:15:25] renger of blood find him without the
[1:15:26] borders of the city off his refuge and
[1:15:29] the Revenger of blood kill the Slayer he
[1:15:32] shall not be guilty of blood because he
[1:15:33] should have remained in the city of uh
[1:15:36] remained in the city of his Refuge until
[1:15:38] the death of the high priest but after
[1:15:39] the death of the high priest the slash
[1:15:40] shall return unto the land of his
[1:15:42] possession so if this guy wanders
[1:15:44] outside the city and the guy that was
[1:15:46] after him sees him even though he was
[1:15:48] rightfully out to be in the city this
[1:15:49] man could just kill him you're outside
[1:15:51] the
[1:15:52] city okay that's how the city of ref
[1:15:54] Refuge worked now I've got a question in
[1:15:57] all this who was chasing this
[1:16:00] person who was chasing
[1:16:03] him well I'll answer the
[1:16:06] question there's a person called the
[1:16:08] Avenger of
[1:16:10] blood and actually that's that's
[1:16:13] actually a kinsman redeemer part of a
[1:16:15] Kinsman redeemer's job is to be the
[1:16:17] Avenger of blood you know when we think
[1:16:19] of the the kinsman redeemer we think you
[1:16:22] know they like oh
[1:16:25] we think of this you know which is what
[1:16:27] it is too you know to
[1:16:28] redeem like Boaz you know he was a
[1:16:30] kinsman redeemer that
[1:16:32] he ksom of redeemers have a certain
[1:16:34] amount of character to them because
[1:16:36] they've got to do something for somebody
[1:16:38] that that person could not do for
[1:16:40] themselves and they've got to it usually
[1:16:41] comes at a cost to themselves
[1:16:45] like but part of their job was to be an
[1:16:49] Avenger of blood as well because if your
[1:16:52] kin had been say your brother your
[1:16:54] someone in your family had been killed
[1:16:56] it was your job to go and execute
[1:16:58] vengeance upon that death and kill
[1:17:00] whoever it was that did that to your
[1:17:02] brother or sister or father whoever it
[1:17:05] was it was your job to go and avenge
[1:17:07] that
[1:17:09] blood you had to you're a kinsman
[1:17:12] redeemer you you got to chase after that
[1:17:14] man the through the whole country or
[1:17:17] woman whoever it was you chase them and
[1:17:19] you go and kill
[1:17:21] him that sounds rough but that was their
[1:17:23] job that that they were and and they
[1:17:26] would some of them were so intent they
[1:17:27] would wait outside the
[1:17:29] city set up home outside the city maybe
[1:17:32] for Years brother wait is that man going
[1:17:34] to come out this try and COA him out the
[1:17:36] minute that man stepped foot out that
[1:17:38] City CU they were an Avenger of
[1:17:41] blood that they were supposed to
[1:17:43] actually go and kill that
[1:17:47] person
[1:17:48] okay but now talking about I just
[1:17:51] quickly want to go through this just to
[1:17:52] type it this way first to show you the
[1:17:54] character that these that that a Kinsman
[1:17:57] had Boaz had to redeem Naomi but then in
[1:18:03] doing so he had to take Ruth and raise
[1:18:05] up seed to Ruth and that seed would not
[1:18:08] be his it would be Ruth's past away
[1:18:11] husband that's how the law of that's how
[1:18:13] the law of um kinsman redeemer in this
[1:18:15] sense worked that the the the Kinsman
[1:18:17] had to come and raise seed up and that
[1:18:19] if there was a boy that boy would be the
[1:18:21] son of the deceased
[1:18:22] husband and so it came at a cost to them
[1:18:25] that's why when Boaz went to the nin
[1:18:27] that had first rights to Naomi his first
[1:18:31] reply was yeah I'll take her and Bo said
[1:18:33] you understand that when you take her
[1:18:35] you've got to take um Ruth and you got
[1:18:38] to raise up seed to Ruth in place of
[1:18:40] your husband you got to it's going to
[1:18:42] cost you something here I just walk in
[1:18:44] and take it easy it's going to cost you
[1:18:46] something and and and that's why that
[1:18:48] man said I can't do it cuz I'm My Own
[1:18:50] inheritance I've got to my own things
[1:18:52] over here I can't do that I relinquish
[1:18:54] my opportunity to be a Kinsman you can
[1:18:56] you take
[1:18:57] her and and that's why with um
[1:19:01] Tamar it was the same it was Tamar's um
[1:19:05] first husband was was a wicked man and
[1:19:08] the Lord slew him so then
[1:19:11] um um uh her father his father what was
[1:19:17] his name um Juda so then Judah said to
[1:19:20] the ne to the the his his next in line
[1:19:22] which was Onan he said okay well you
[1:19:25] need to go and be a kinsman redeemer to
[1:19:27] um to Tamer and you you need to go and
[1:19:31] raise up seed to your brother so so when
[1:19:33] she has a a seed a son that's going to
[1:19:36] be the son of er that's what you need to
[1:19:37] go and do as a kinsman redeemer you need
[1:19:40] to go and do that to her and it took a
[1:19:44] it's going to take sacrifice for that
[1:19:46] man it's going to take effort he has to
[1:19:48] you know he has to redeem her and but
[1:19:51] what he did was he went in and he he
[1:19:54] slept with her but then it says that at
[1:19:56] the end he spilled his seed on the
[1:19:58] ground because he knew he didn't want
[1:20:01] actually to he want he didn't want to
[1:20:04] raise up
[1:20:05] seed and the Lord saw that as so wicked
[1:20:08] because he said I say you you you took
[1:20:10] her body but you see she didn't want her
[1:20:11] heart because in her heart she wanted SE
[1:20:13] she wanted a she wanted the line to
[1:20:14] carry on she she wanted to bring forth
[1:20:16] but you just took her body left her
[1:20:19] heart you basically just left your heart
[1:20:21] on the ground and you took her body cuz
[1:20:23] that's essentially what he did cuz
[1:20:24] that's what she want wanted and he
[1:20:25] didn't give that to her and that's what
[1:20:26] he was supposed to do and the Lord found
[1:20:29] that so wicked that he took Vengeance
[1:20:30] and slew him because you you should have
[1:20:33] taken her body and her heart that was
[1:20:35] your responsibility and you just did
[1:20:36] that I think about him and I think you
[1:20:38] would have been better off doing it now
[1:20:40] you're
[1:20:41] dead sure your brother might have had
[1:20:43] you rais seed to your brother let you be
[1:20:45] alive you made the silly move and then
[1:20:47] now you're dead you got
[1:20:49] nothing silly
[1:20:52] boy we we we we'll go on
[1:20:56] but but a Kinsman has the same
[1:20:59] responsibility to take Vengeance as well
[1:21:02] because there's this principle that the
[1:21:03] land must be purged that's why that's
[1:21:07] why it carries on and the Lord says
[1:21:09] moreover you shall Take No Satisfaction
[1:21:12] for the life of a
[1:21:13] murderer uh which is guilty of death but
[1:21:16] he shall surely be put to death and he
[1:21:18] says and you shall Take No Satisfaction
[1:21:20] to him that has fled to the city of his
[1:21:22] Refuge that he should come again and to
[1:21:24] dwell in the land until the death of the
[1:21:26] high priest if he leaves those Gates
[1:21:28] there's no
[1:21:29] mercy Take No
[1:21:31] Satisfaction don't be all soft on your
[1:21:33] heart oh the guy's been there for 40
[1:21:35] years let him go see his family no
[1:21:38] satisfaction so ye shall not pollute the
[1:21:41] land wherein ye are for blood it
[1:21:43] defileth the land and the land cannot be
[1:21:46] cleansed by the blood that is shed
[1:21:48] therein but by the blood of him that
[1:21:50] shed
[1:21:52] it defile not therefore the land which
[1:21:54] you shall inhabit wherein I dwell for I
[1:21:57] the Lord dwell among the children of
[1:21:59] Israel so he's saying You must be an
[1:22:02] Avenger of blood you got to keep this
[1:22:05] land
[1:22:06] clean you can't just sit back oh well no
[1:22:10] if you must avenge your
[1:22:12] Kinsmen you
[1:22:14] must and God's saying if you don't
[1:22:16] you're going to defile the land this
[1:22:18] land's going to be polluted because you
[1:22:19] didn't avenge your kin you just let laid
[1:22:23] back and let him let this murderer run
[1:22:24] around you didn't avenge
[1:22:26] it and he said I I dwell here this is my
[1:22:30] land this is where I live keep it
[1:22:33] clean
[1:22:35] yeah it sounds powerful but it's but
[1:22:38] there's a there's a there's a bigger
[1:22:39] principle in all this of being an
[1:22:41] Avenger of blood and a Kinsman that we
[1:22:44] have a responsibility to now in this day
[1:22:46] we've got a responsibility as Kinsmen to
[1:22:48] we've got some avenging to do we've got
[1:22:51] some there's some Vengeance that we have
[1:22:53] to meet out
[1:22:55] that is a responsibility to cleanse the
[1:22:58] land I want to go to this and I'll I'll
[1:23:01] go into that I want to start talking
[1:23:04] about the day of Vengeance now Jesus
[1:23:06] when he was when he was here he it says
[1:23:08] one day he went into the temple and it
[1:23:10] says and when he came to Nazareth where
[1:23:11] and he had been brought up and as his
[1:23:13] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[1:23:15] the Sabbath day and stood up for it to
[1:23:16] read and there was delivered unto him a
[1:23:18] book of the prophet Isaiah so they a
[1:23:20] priest came up and and and handed a book
[1:23:22] on onto the where he was walked up with
[1:23:24] it and then it says and when he had
[1:23:26] opened up the book he found the place
[1:23:27] where it was
[1:23:29] written he read he said the spirit of
[1:23:31] the Lord is upon me because Heath
[1:23:32] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:23:34] poor and he has sent me to heal the
[1:23:36] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:23:37] the captives and the recovering of sight
[1:23:39] to the Blind and set at Liberty them
[1:23:41] that are bruised to preach the
[1:23:43] acceptable year of the Lord then it says
[1:23:46] he closed the
[1:23:47] book and he brought it back down to the
[1:23:49] priest and it says and he gave it and
[1:23:51] and he gave it again to the minister and
[1:23:53] sat down and the eyes of all of them
[1:23:55] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:23:56] on him and he began to say unto them
[1:23:59] this day is the scripture fulfilled in
[1:24:00] your
[1:24:02] ears so you're he said you're seeing the
[1:24:04] Fulfillment of this unfolding as we
[1:24:06] speak this is happening right now but
[1:24:08] then we go back into the the the place
[1:24:11] where he read from and we read it and it
[1:24:12] say this is where he read from it says
[1:24:14] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:24:16] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:24:17] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[1:24:20] sent me to bind up the broken hearted to
[1:24:22] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[1:24:24] opening of the prison to them that
[1:24:25] abound to proclaim the acceptable year
[1:24:27] of the Lord and then he stopped there
[1:24:29] but he stopped mids
[1:24:32] sentence and the last of it the next
[1:24:34] sentence says and the day of Vengeance
[1:24:36] of our
[1:24:37] God he didn't read that because it
[1:24:39] wasn't quite the day of Vengeance of our
[1:24:41] God but it's here
[1:24:44] now now brother Brandon preached the
[1:24:47] message and 24th of January 1965 called
[1:24:50] birth
[1:24:51] pains and he got up to start to read his
[1:24:55] message and he had a new Bible he opened
[1:24:57] it up then he said I'll will go to St
[1:24:59] John's gospel the 17th chapter and
[1:25:01] beginning with the 20th verse I wish to
[1:25:02] read for a text I think it's right he
[1:25:04] gets the
[1:25:05] wrong chapter and book verse for the
[1:25:08] first one because it's supposed to be 16
[1:25:09] he says then he says Ah I believe I got
[1:25:12] the wrong place now excuse me uh just a
[1:25:14] moment I'm looking for jesus' prayer
[1:25:16] that uh Jesus prayer rather but for as I
[1:25:19] might have got marked down here on my
[1:25:21] text somewhere wrong it's where Jesus
[1:25:23] prayed or was saying that as a woman a
[1:25:25] travail for birth of a child child birth
[1:25:27] is TR so I'm looking for that verse and
[1:25:29] it's
[1:25:30] 1720 is not the right verse and then
[1:25:34] there's a bit of Talk Amongst them they
[1:25:35] say oh no uh you want 16 brother
[1:25:37] brandham uh chapter 16 verse um uh verse
[1:25:42] 21 it's 16:21 so so then he opens up his
[1:25:45] Bible like this and and I've put this
[1:25:49] verse down the bottom of the page like
[1:25:50] that so you can imagine this verse is
[1:25:52] sitting at the bottom and he reads John
[1:25:54] then it says very very sound to you that
[1:25:56] yes so no it's not that one so then he
[1:25:57] turns the page over to there which is so
[1:26:01] we got verse 20 then he turns the page
[1:26:04] over verse 21 and he says that they may
[1:26:07] be one and he says no no and we'll go
[1:26:10] back what' you say it was
[1:26:14] 1621 and he'll go back here and okay so
[1:26:17] yep that's
[1:26:18] 20 you turn back over and get 21 on the
[1:26:21] top of the that page you say
[1:26:26] that they no that's not are you sure
[1:26:28] it's 21 they say yeah brother brand it's
[1:26:29] 21 the verse you want and then after a
[1:26:33] little while he says well that's what it
[1:26:36] is there's a misprint in this Bible
[1:26:38] That's they're missing out a page you
[1:26:39] know there's that look there's no 21
[1:26:43] here Brothers it's it's the we're in
[1:26:44] another place it's a you know at the
[1:26:47] start he thought it was something then
[1:26:48] he realized he's a mistake so
[1:26:51] then what happened then was a priest
[1:26:55] a Catholic priest that was in the in the
[1:26:57] meeting had a Bible on him and he walked
[1:26:59] up to the pulpit and handed brother Bram
[1:27:01] his Bible and and when he went up there
[1:27:03] he
[1:27:04] said he Catholic Archbishop John Stanley
[1:27:07] gives his Bible to brother bam and says
[1:27:09] he said just draw breath there's a
[1:27:12] reason why it was done and you know it
[1:27:14] and God will show you something to bring
[1:27:16] out of this that's
[1:27:18] wonderful something out of this that's
[1:27:20] wonderful and brother B says all right
[1:27:21] just use mine here brother Brenham he
[1:27:23] says thank you thank you very much
[1:27:24] thank you very much then he reads then
[1:27:26] he reads
[1:27:28] um um the I should have got that verse
[1:27:31] he reads about birth pains as a woman is
[1:27:33] in travail you know and birth pains
[1:27:35] coming upon the
[1:27:37] world he reads that and once he's
[1:27:40] finished reading the verse he goes and
[1:27:41] walks down and hands the Bible back to
[1:27:43] the
[1:27:44] priest and then he preaches a message
[1:27:46] called birth pains which is saying
[1:27:50] there's there's a pain there's a travail
[1:27:52] coming upon the Earth it's it's coming
[1:27:55] on and and there's a judgment there's
[1:27:57] Vengeance coming upon the Earth he began
[1:28:00] to
[1:28:01] preach the day of
[1:28:05] Vengeance because he was fulfilling the
[1:28:07] second half of this prophecy and the day
[1:28:10] of Vengeance of our God and he's
[1:28:11] ushering in the day of Vengeance there's
[1:28:14] a day of Vengeance coming on the earth
[1:28:16] like of God's Fierce Vengeance like
[1:28:18] you've never seen
[1:28:20] before he's and and and because you know
[1:28:22] you see the type that je the priest
[1:28:25] walked up to Jesus he read the first but
[1:28:26] bring it back down this one the priest
[1:28:28] walked up he read the and he brought it
[1:28:30] back down and he preach birth pains
[1:28:32] which is the the day of
[1:28:36] Vengeance
[1:28:39] and we are now living in the second half
[1:28:42] of this verse and it's all around you
[1:28:44] it's everywhere you
[1:28:45] look everywhere you look everything you
[1:28:49] feel everything you experience Brewing
[1:28:52] amongst all this is the Fierce Vengeance
[1:28:55] of God that's just permeating through
[1:28:57] the whole thing
[1:29:00] Vengeance that's a there's no escaping
[1:29:03] this day of Vengeance it's here and it's
[1:29:05] just coming
[1:29:06] on it's it's and it's it's not going to
[1:29:09] be it's not going to pull back it's not
[1:29:11] going to oh I take that back it's going
[1:29:14] to it's going to meet all of the
[1:29:16] punishment that it wants to that it
[1:29:17] desires to me this Fierce day of
[1:29:21] Vengeance these birth pains it's this
[1:29:23] tribulation there's going to be
[1:29:24] tribulation like the world's never seen
[1:29:25] before why because it's Vengeance there
[1:29:28] Fierce Vengeance it's a we the only
[1:29:31] thing we got going on for us here is a
[1:29:32] day of Vengeance that's it it's a day of
[1:29:36] Vengeance and and that's why he says say
[1:29:38] to them that have a fearful heart be
[1:29:40] strong fear not behold your God will
[1:29:41] come with vengeance even god with the
[1:29:44] recompense he will come and save you a
[1:29:47] lot of times he says vengeance is me
[1:29:48] coming to save
[1:29:51] you now I want to bring this around to a
[1:29:54] different way of who we are now in this
[1:29:57] time of Vengeance because we have a part
[1:29:58] to play in this Vengeance I say this
[1:30:01] actually we'll go back here after this
[1:30:03] after he preached birth pains brother BR
[1:30:05] preached a sermon called this day this
[1:30:07] scripture is fulfilled the next day this
[1:30:09] day the scripture is
[1:30:11] fulfilled because he said he said all
[1:30:14] the scriptures are going to be fulfilled

[1:35:27] I've been through the hardest thing I've
[1:35:28] ever been through for the last two years
[1:35:29] in my entire life it's like I've just
[1:35:33] been I've had demons at me from every
[1:35:35] direction like just
[1:35:39] relentlessly like down to the wire for
[1:35:45] like you wouldn't believe like I've been
[1:35:46] through some hard stuff for this one's
[1:35:47] on another level this is like you
[1:35:50] kidding me there's a whole Legion of
[1:35:52] demons just following run all B it was
[1:35:54] just just
[1:35:55] intense now for two whole years they
[1:35:58] they just these things at me they
[1:35:59] comeing waves and this and that and like
[1:36:02] I never had a fear of ever being beaten
[1:36:05] because I got I don't know there's
[1:36:05] something in me that just I know overall
[1:36:08] I'm not going to be completely done
[1:36:09] although I might get smashed a pulp and
[1:36:12] end up on the ground I sort of you know
[1:36:14] may I kind of open my mouth is that all
[1:36:16] you got you know then I'll get up the
[1:36:18] next day and give it another go I never
[1:36:20] had a problem with getting up again it
[1:36:23] was never the isue but I got sick of
[1:36:25] being ended up on ending up on the mat
[1:36:28] like man there's a day when I'm not
[1:36:30] going to you're not going to get me at
[1:36:32] all these demons are coming at me they
[1:36:34] would they leave me for a bit then
[1:36:36] they'd come back and it would just come
[1:36:37] waves of stuff and and they would always
[1:36:39] get me just either a little bit or a big
[1:36:41] amount if they got me a big amount I
[1:36:43] shouldn't say nothing bad but it was
[1:36:46] just they would get me but if they got
[1:36:49] me a small amount it was not so bad but
[1:36:52] it was still an amount see if I want to
[1:36:54] be a kinsman redeemer Avenger of blood
[1:36:56] there's going to be
[1:36:57] nothing because a small amount means you
[1:36:59] get me nothing means I get
[1:37:01] you I I'm I get you and I'm like I get
[1:37:05] you you caused me so much grief you

[1:37:29] that spot there's going to be trouble
[1:37:30] for you like you never

[1:37:36] thing came at with with everything it's
[1:37:37] got man and it was days and days and I
[1:37:41] just thought n today this time's the
[1:37:43] time I ain't budging one inch on these
[1:37:45] things
[1:37:45] man I'm I'm just going to stand these
[1:37:48] guys ain't going to get me on this one
[1:37:49] and day after day man I just
[1:37:52] stood stand
[1:37:54] and relentlessly it came but you know
[1:37:56] what after about 2 or 3 days of this
[1:37:58] I've just I fought back with everything
[1:38:00] I had mouth thought it's like it's now
[1:38:02] or
[1:38:03] never it's been years of this I'm I'm
[1:38:06] I'm dealing with these things today this
[1:38:10] day the scriptures fulfilled man I
[1:38:12] started beating these guys back it was
[1:38:13] so hard CU you just you used to all
[1:38:15] their blows to get you this way you come
[1:38:17] over here they get you there you just
[1:38:18] you know where they get you and every
[1:38:19] time he's going to come that way and I
[1:38:20] just I got I'm not going to let him get
[1:38:21] me there he ain't getting me there he
[1:38:23] ain't getting me there it was a like a
[1:38:25] fight to the death you know but everyone
[1:38:28] I repelled at all every single one after
[1:38:30] about two or three days I felt you know
[1:38:32] the Bible says resist the devil he'll
[1:38:33] flee from you after about two or three
[1:38:36] days these things started to be on the
[1:38:37] run I'm
[1:38:39] like that was it these guys are on the
[1:38:42] Run first time in years they ain't down
[1:38:44] this
[1:38:45] time didn't go down like you know when
[1:38:49] you realize that I didn't go down this
[1:38:51] time you get so much like confidence you
[1:38:53] think wow was that all you had and you
[1:38:55] couldn't do it am may you better watch
[1:38:58] out cuz I'm just getting started
[1:39:01] here like when David slew
[1:39:04] Goliath what happened when he slew
[1:39:07] Goliath he didn't go well that's Goliath
[1:39:09] done you know time to go home boys when
[1:39:12] Goliath fell what happened we can get
[1:39:15] all the rest of them too and the whole
[1:39:16] of the Israeli Army just started to
[1:39:17] moveing and these guys fled they slew
[1:39:20] them in The Valleys in the rivers on the
[1:39:21] mountains anywhere they could find them
[1:39:23] because they you know when you when you
[1:39:26] f one of these people you can just move
[1:39:27] you start moving through I thought you
[1:39:29] did the I got so much Vengeance Brewing
[1:39:32] on me against these things that have
[1:39:33] hampered me like and if you don't get me
[1:39:36] that time you actually the Revelation
[1:39:38] came you can never get me never I'm
[1:39:43] undefeatable now you can never ever get
[1:39:44] me I look around think I know your
[1:39:47] tactics you tried them all none of them
[1:39:48] worked you never got
[1:39:51] me that's a mentality you realize
[1:39:54] then you'll never get
[1:39:57] me then I'm going to be a pretty nasty
[1:40:00] kinsman
[1:40:01] redeemer a pretty nasty Avenger of Blood
[1:40:05] Cuz I can get you you can't get me so I
[1:40:07] want to go through and slay all my
[1:40:09] enemies defeat you at every turn you
[1:40:12] think that's pretty bold you tell me any
[1:40:14] other way we're going to do
[1:40:16] it tell me the other
[1:40:22] way just in closing here that's why you
[1:40:25] know we talk about a new there's going
[1:40:27] to be a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:40:29] that's why this Earth has to be like
[1:40:31] there just there's got to be this Divine
[1:40:32] judgment there's got to be Vengeance
[1:40:34] taken on it because because the Lord
[1:40:36] said in this other the numbers here he
[1:40:38] says so you shall not pollute the land
[1:40:40] wherein you are and it says 34 says
[1:40:42] defile not the land we in and which you
[1:40:45] shall inhabit wherein I
[1:40:47] dwell for I the Lord dwell among the
[1:40:49] children of Israel now the Lord's going
[1:40:51] to end up dwelling here he's got to
[1:40:54] avenge it that's his job to do this that
[1:40:57] the avenging in terms of natural things
[1:40:59] and people we don't the avenging I'm
[1:41:00] talking about is against demons that
[1:41:02] have come against our Kinsmen so I'm not
[1:41:04] going to go around killing any any
[1:41:06] person naturally or punching them over
[1:41:08] you know it's not but yet God there's
[1:41:10] got to be avengeance for all the sin
[1:41:11] that's done upon this Earth that's why
[1:41:14] this whole birth pains and tribulation
[1:41:16] is coming on because it's it's got to be
[1:41:17] the Lord says I'm going to live here
[1:41:19] I've got to settle the score on this
[1:41:21] Earth I can't have un
[1:41:25] unfinished uh pollution on the land I'm
[1:41:28] going to have to I have to square
[1:41:30] everything up before we can move
[1:41:34] in essentially he's got to that and and
[1:41:37] that's God's Vengeance he said it's the
[1:41:39] day of Vengeance it's the day that I'm
[1:41:40] going to purge the whole land that's his
[1:41:43] Vengeance he's going about all the sin
[1:41:45] you see around you it it's it's not
[1:41:48] going to go unpunished there's
[1:41:50] vengeance is is brewing to sort the
[1:41:54] whole thing out to settle every single
[1:41:55] account and there's never been a time of
[1:41:57] so much sin in the world and so much
[1:41:59] evil and just heart the last time it got
[1:42:03] almost this bad was when it was when it
[1:42:05] was um Noah and and God in his heart
[1:42:08] thought I just can't take this anymore
[1:42:11] probably weren't even as many people on
[1:42:12] the Earth as then it's the same sort of
[1:42:15] thing I can't take this
[1:42:17] anymore that's why it's a day of
[1:42:19] Vengeance Fierce Vengeance that and
[1:42:22] every score is going to be settled every
[1:42:24] every it's all going to be squared up so
[1:42:26] that there's no pollution in the land so
[1:42:27] when we come back here it's going to be
[1:42:29] clean no no unfinished scores no
[1:42:32] unsettled it's a day of
[1:42:36] Vengeance so that's
