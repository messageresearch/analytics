and grabbed you by the hand father every individual in here has come by this weekend father to seek something from you Lord Lord we want to touch from your father Lord we're gathered here just to praise you know Justin lift you up father and just to praise your holy name because father you're worth it you're the king of kings and the Lord of lords father Lord who are the same father in the beginning father you're the same today father Oh Lord you're the same god of Moses of Abraham of Samson oh Lord I miss you today in this very moment father this weekend Lord father you have given us

may you take all our praise and all our worship to you we ask them pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen church say Amen amen hallelujah Laurey [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay you may have your seats now Liz she's right here to give you the safety introduction thanks welcome welcome to forest lakes and I've got the really boring mundane pass of the health and safety if you do need to evacuate anywhere because of a fire or something else out on the playing field along the fence by the driveway where you came in but on the field side there is different venue names and numbers the numbers relate to the cabins that you're in and so if you line up over there then then they can check you off easily and know that you're not lost and know that they don't have to look for anybody the fire alarms are around the camp they don't actually connect to the fire brigade so you will need to dial one one one from a mobile phone if you're using one of the camp phones you'll need to dial nine before you ring one one if it's an earthquake it's comes down to common sense if you can get underneath something that's going to protect you that's great otherwise they say near a wall but not near a window and a little bit of hope for the best because we're not quite sure what happens in an earthquake all of the activities around camper out-of-bounds but there's not many children here at the moment but at least as an adult supervising them then they're generally out of bounds and the plague room went playground we asked for common sense a trampoline here's a hundred kilo weight limit on it so if you're gonna get two teenagers on there they're probably too heavy and we'll just say one if it's littler children in the weight limit is 100 kilos and the tire swing is for people and we recommend on the roundabout just one person pure little triangular section it's in there if you want to go swimming mean you're welcome to swim in the pole we ask that you don't swim in the light just because if you get into danger it's really dark and it's really hard to find you if you go missing in the air there plenty rubbish burns around the camp so please put your rubbish in the air generally we say if you can keep the noise down after 10 o'clock that's really great especially because we're in a bit of a hollow here and it travels up the hills out to the neighbors and we don't want to annoy it too many of them the other thing that's just started happening it camp again as its hasn't happened in the last few days because I've got colder I was going to say is it's got warmer as the mosquitoes have come out and we can't do anything about those because of the lake so we suggest that if you have your light on in your cabin you have your doors and windows shut so don't walk away and leave the door open and the lights on because you'll have company when you come back so just remember turn your light out if you're going to have your windows or doors open if you need stuff to clean and toilet paper and things like that just outside our camp office and the octagonal building is as the double-dog cupboard in this penny a toilet paper and stuff in there if you're in cabins 1 to 8 in the bottom of the Roundhouse those ones are slightly tricky because they have a cardboard core in the middle of them and that 8 toilet paper pulls out from the centre and so if it's during the day then grant or I will be around camp and we'll we have to help you tomorrow morning I'll be in Palmerston North for cricket but the rest of the time will be about any questions that you've got and we're in the office feel free to ask us otherwise feel free to ask being or one of the team because they've got information on how to contact us if we're not yeah if we're not about these guys have seen out the toilets over and here just for ladies and at the end of the book when you go back over the bridge there's a concrete block building against the bank over there that's the toilets for the mean the other place that there are communal toilets is underneath the chairman Capel building past the swimming pool over it came um other than there I haven't got anything else to say except to have a fabulous weekend have you got anything you want to eat [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen do you feel good this evening and when somebody say Amen Amen hallelujah just want to say something before we start amen I'm just want to say that I'm blessed to be a Christian and when I'm blessed to be a Christian because I can walk through life without confident knowing that I'm one of them I mean I can walk on the street and I remember I remember the things that God has done for me you know I begin to ask myself what makes me one of them I'm gonna think of the blessings that he's bestowed on my life and when I begin to think of those things I become thankful it just happens automatically you just start thinking him in your heart and then wherever you go you just begin to rejoice I'm sure I'm not the only one with that experience that we begin to think of the things that I've done for you you begin to rejoice you begin to thank him amen so this morning is sorry this evenin I want you to let's all stand and I want you to at least turn to five people and point to them and say you're one of them you're one of them [Music] well I'm one of them [Music] I'm one of them well I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of um let's see take your time take your time I'm so glad that I can't say [Music] one of them [Music] [Music] [Music]
