to have brother Phil sister Belinda here god bless you amen brother James say that may be be nice to them and they'll stay there's nothing I don't over praise the Lord trust you feel at home I mean it's great to have a brother Chris off the boat to feel welcome great to have you here I mean let's uh let's turn to Leviticus chapter 25 and I've got a bit of a PowerPoint of it's there are we on so I'd like to continue oh here we are yeah good so let's go to Leviticus 25 I'd like to continue on this sort of breaking the cycle of the ages but I want to go in a slightly different direction today so Leviticus chapter 25 so I think I see 24 we'll read from verse 8 down to verse 13 and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's of years unto thee seven times seven years in the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the Day of Atonement show you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man under his family a jubilee shall be that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not so neither reap that which growth of itself in it nor gather the grape in it of I why a vine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase arrived out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man under his position and then we're going to turn somewhat emphasize that every man shall return unto his position let's go to the Book of Luke and we're gonna read a familiar piece of scripture so I want to who enjoyed the service on Sunday here Amen praise the Lord so yes I did so that I thought was tremendous and and I was just amazed because what I want to speak on I want to actually when we had community washing I want to actually cancel it and and preach this and that's what you'll see who ties them with my brother Isaac brought so it's just I think it was wonderful have the Lord ties things together but anyway let's go to Luke 4 and verse 17 the very familiar piece of Scripture I trust to us here but this is such as Jesus when he goes back to Nazareth he goes to the synagogue in and the and the scroll has given to him and she said there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sites of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to sound damn this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning so what do I want to continue about breaking breaking the cycle of the ages where we read in Leviticus 25 that become a time of Jubilee where everyone who wasn't bondage wasn't slavery they would return unto his possession and and now I want to take this from a from a different angle where we're living in a day an hour where man by society and by what happens to man has become detached from the rest of the world and that's not just I'm not talking about us and nature I'm talking about us emotionally with our spirit realm with our family with brothers and sisters those around us that the devil has come in in such a way in this age where he wants to and and by society by things around us he has actually tried to disable the effectiveness of our faith because our souls have been redeemed right so our souls are sealed unto the day of our redemption we know where we're going if you've really met the Lord Jesus Christ I mean his word has come open to you in this hour you've really met him you know where you're going right but so the devil can't get your soul but he can he can afflict you a sickness and he can get into your spirit realm and he can eat and put complexes and bruises in there to disable your faith and it's not effective anymore so this is where I'm going okay but so when when we read that every man shall return unto his position now this is now we know that in the Old Testament it was a parcel of land you know in the promised land but our position is our position in Christ right we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we have a Dominion you know the devil is under our feet and his works but the thing is so if we're going to return to our position then then we have to be made in such a way that we could minister what's been given to us to those around us so you know part of that return to our position is that everything the devil is put unto us that is trying to our walk with God has to be done away with so so that is part of the Jubilee where we go free of we go free of complexes we go free of you know brokenness pain hurt whatever it may be we go free of it I mean it hasn't said it when the trumpet sounds and we know we're living in the Day of Atonement I met with the time it was shared 2,000 years ago the high priest has come out to reveal the blood was given on your behalf then the jubilee trumpet has sounded and now we have to return to our position we've heard the gospel trumpet we have to go free we have to return it's a law in the word you have to return to your position so this is where we have to go but the thing is we have to fight for every inch of ground I mean we can't just sit back and say well the God will do it no faith says it's mine right now faith does not say one day face here's today it's my promise today it's my inheritance today I'm going to get what I need I'm not going to wait for tomorrow today that's what faith sees amen so we we want to press it and we want to take what belongs to us now I read this in Luke chapter 4 because when the son of man Jesus Christ came the first time when he read went into the synagogue and he and yoke he didn't just read from random from the scrolls but he found in Isaiah this piece of Scripture because that was prophecy speaking of what his ministry would do when he became flesh right so now and we understand that this the speaks of our day because when you read the prophecy on Isaiah he Jesus left out the last part of the last verse I said and the day of vengeance of our God which spoke about a second coming but now but when the Son of Man comes this is going to be his ministry he's going to sit he's going to you know he's going to and so he's going to sit me he's going to heal the brokenhearted he's going to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering it aside to the blind and is set at liberty them that are bruised now all of these things are actually speaking of in our spirit realm speaking about through our spirit realm so now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say this here so so to be brokenhearted though I'm just going to break this down because we can we can read it and just go plum over the top of the significance of it but I want to just break it down so brokenhearted means to crush completely that is to be shattered literally or figuratively breaking pieces broken to shivers that's what to be broken hearted so someone who's been has actually been heartbroken now before a gondor's I should say we've all been affected negatively by this world by our upbringing by people around us by circumstance so we can either have a complete mental breakdown or something can just affect us just a little bit but we're all affected right so it's just like any natural disease it can be really bad or not so bad be the same disease so when I go into this please don't take it as well that's not for me this is all for us cuz the devil wants to disable our faith he doesn't want God to flow through us like he should amen so now so to be brokenhearted means to be crushed completely there's just to be shattered breaking pieces now a captive as a prisoner of war and we can become captive to a complex we can come captive to a Bruce just like naturally if I've got a big massive bruise on me I can't run I can't do the things I do if I'm healthy physically speaking you know but once I'm healed then I can do what I used to do so you know so to be a captives me means to be a prisoner of war this is from the Strong's Concordance if you're wondering now to be blind a blindness it means to opaque as a smokey that is by an LG blind physically or mentally blind so a blindness can come on us where maybe we can see 20/20 vision naturally but spiritually our eyes become clouded over so we become blinded and to be at liberty means you get your pardons these are deliverance of forgiveness a remission and bruised means to be crushed so I'm going to read the verse again with all that included in he says the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted that as those have been crushed completely that as those have been shattered right emotionally be shattered been crushed to preach deliverance to the captives those who become prisoners of war they meant and a recovering of the sites of the blinds of those who couldn't see they're physically or mentally I mean their eyes come open to see that Liberty which is a part in a deliverance of forgiveness and liberty a remission then that a Bruce those have been crushed we've all been crushed to a certain extent by by life whether we like it or not we all have been but the anointing of the Son of Man is here the son of man Jesus Christ is present as well this message brings son of the son of man here and this is the Ministry of the son of man as you set us free right that we can walk with the Lord like he wants us to walk now we have to understand there are unfortunately there are powers and complexes right there are I don't want to I'm not wanting to elevate the works of the devil but someone can be can can't can have a pain or wound in their spirit and all they see is through that their whole view is skewed by something that has happened to them and so now so someone can be heard in the past and then now that hurt their carrying and it wounds their spirit and then now how they see everyone else is because of that but the people that they're now maybe dealing with or living with they they weren't back there but they're still carrying a wound God doesn't want us to carry words he wants us to be whole and healthy and well I mean so now and this is so so this isn't a return and Jubilee brother brems sees here he sees and in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a free born a true-blooded israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance oh my he had a right to it that was God god-given right because he by grace had it here today and it would be given to had been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free if it meant to grace sorry it meant grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in these last days you see what man do and then you can see what God does what man does is failing and will fail has failed and always will fail but what God does is eternal must for every make nothing can ever take it away God give it it's a free gift and and by sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and jubilee was God's manner of expressing grace to his people for restoring or bought or be bought back to their rightful position so we're in an hour where we're call to return to our rightful position how lujah now and in second Timothy Paul was writing to Paul is writing to Timothy and he's dealing a lot in the book of Timothy about Timothy's current state now Timothy is a young young minister he is told to do the work of an evangelist there is a gift there's a ministerial gift in his life and the devil has been bombarding Timothy trying to get him off the field now this when I'm speaking about this this is not just a preacher this is all of us the devil as I said wants to disable our faith amen he wants to stop us being effective for God's kingdom right but God wants you to be effective I mean for his kingdom but it's your free moral choice I mean who are you going to allow are you going to be a love prison of Jesus Christ and to overcome every circumstance of life or are you going to be a prisoner to a complex it's really your choice because God is a gentleman the devil's not a gentleman but God is a gentleman he respects if you want to stay bound he respects your choice it sounds crazy doesn't it but God respects your choice I mean animals weren't put on a free moral agency but man was and God respects the choice of man so if you want to stay bound you will stay bound it's your choice I mean God has has shaken every spiritual gift to us in this age he's come down and revealed himself as the son of man he's opened his word as fullness I mean the creative powers been manifested the full power of the Cross being manifested in the ministry brother branham in the state to show us that Jesus Christ is alive but it's your choice will you actually partake of it will you become one with the word or will you sit back with your complex it's really that you know what do you want you want to walk free or do you want to stay the thing is that but you think well this happened to me and this happened to me in life sure it did happen I'm not diminishing anything that's happened to us in life but there is a power in this room the power of the blood is present that you don't have to live in the past anymore you can't walk in newness of life if you want to right so why dwell in the past man never met man never learns from history history repeats itself because man is still man doesn't matter how well they document history you know they try to live in the past they never learn from their mistakes why live in the past walk in newness of life so then he's he's telling Timothy here when when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in my grandmother Lois and my mother Eunice and I am persuaded as in the also wherefore I put the in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind that's what he's given us and all of us have a gift we have the gift of faith right God's God gives us faith I mean the believer doesn't look wolf by human faith the Apostle Paul said the life I now live I live by the faith in the Son of God so the life he was living by was that by the faith of Jesus Christ himself it wasn't his own faith right so when God gives us real faith it's his faith in us I mean since our he is commanding Timothy I mean to stir up the gift of God that that is within him hallelujah and that gift is ultimately faith because we all have a gift world gifted people Holly doesn't matter if we can't sing to save ourselves or we can't play nothing we can't you know but we have a gift that is a gift of faith I mean we you can come and you can sing and worship God and you can create an atmosphere that God comes down around you I mean that that God would touch those next you God would touch you hallelujah that's the gift of faith a brings God on the scene hallelujah and that's what we want to do amen so God is here to send us free of these things so we have to stir up the gift so notice notice that Paul tells Timothy you know this is the secret of her bottom overcoming there's stir up the gift of God that's how he's to overcome stir up the faith I mean so don't look at don't major on the circumstance right but focus on your faith that you have I mean you follow me that's what you've got to do now I heard brother Isaac read this one he says and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and to antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God see toddlers not going to be a flower beard of East but through much tribulation you will enter into the kingdom now this word tribulation means a pressure means to be afflicted and anguish burdened persecution tribulation trouble through much so through much pressure I mean through much affliction through much anguish much burdens much persecution much trouble much tribulation you will enter into the kingdom of God so now there's a there's we and we are the same through much tribulation will enter the kingdom of God but the thing is God allows the tribulation to or anguish to to come our way is because he knows his salvation is greater than anything that devil can do so doesn't matter how the devil may try and disable our faith I mean God is greater than then the work of the enemy hallelujah so now so brother season faith I'll just turn that off faith cometh by hearing you know because the thing is okay what I'm going to go to is this this there's a there's something in psychology where it speaks about emotional detachment where people become actually emotionally numb to their loved ones to people they know so they don't actually feel anything they become numb and it's a coping mechanism because of great trauma people actually become emotionally detached so they can't actually enter into someone they can't feel with any empathy to those around them they can't they don't have any feeling for the people and it's because of circumstance that it happens because of trauma and things happen to people and they withdraw within themselves and they lose their feeling for the people now I'll just read this and then I'm going to go to where brother Brown speaks about it so so faith cometh by hearing no but God doesn't want us to be numb God doesn't want us to be business like a mint but we we need to have real feeling for one another how can you bear each each other's burdens if you don't have a feeling for what they're going through you say but that's just the spiritual realm God gave us a spiritual realm when we become believers our feelings don't turn off right we don't become robots I mean but God anoints our fiction our conscious imagination reasoning memory affection he anoints those things to use them amen for his glory that's like if you like the woman of the world she remembered having a man problem she was with six Jets well she had five husbands once she was worse she wasn't married to a minister she knew what it was like to look for love in all the wrong places right but then she met the son of man at the well she met her real husband right and she left her waterpot and she ran into the city amen and she ran to those that actually rejected her she went to the well at a time when the other woman didn't go to the well why she wasn't welcome right but so she had this pain and complex now where these people have rejected me and this is how my life is gonna be and she was trying to look for love in all the wrong places and this is how she was but then she met the son of man I mean and the very ones that rejected her she ran back to television Messiah is here hallelujah and so now and so now she becomes a believer and there's nothing new Under the Sun so the things that we go through we have fought and overcome the next generation will fight and overcome right but then someone comes into the church maybe you know she's maybe be married divorce whatever you know and she can and the woman at the well could enter into her burden she could say I know what it's like to be where you are and she can share her history so God can anoint her memory of where she was and God can use that memory in that pain that she had but was healed from and she can enter into someone other sisters need and she can pray for her and she can be delivered Allu yeah but if she's just emotionally separate she said oh that person just needs to grow up and hurry up and grow in the Lord and just you know and just look at his the rules and regulations and have no feeling what's happened then the devil's disabled the woman at the well if she was that way but if she but she met the son of man so she wasn't emotionally detached right and she could enter in oh yeah that's why we're safe for many different places because there's not a case that someone can walk in these doors and and and eventually be set yeah I I was that way I lived that way I was lost I was because people come in and they say and they and they look at you and they say these people have been Saints avoids being say so as will be Saints they don't understand me they can't relate and and and really you're going to say well hold on sit down and talk to us for a little bit hallelujah and actually they'll walk out shocked I can't believe they were that way Holloway up but God transform gold sorry Ron amen hallelujah so so we don't want to and this is a very real problem especially in this country where's the stoic but at a fix-all but the stoic kind of the British stuff step up a look whatever that means you know just kind of hold it all in and be a man about it you know and and what is it societies become emotionally detached had a fix man and woman based on what has happened to you so so so brother Brahim sees here but we don't have to live that way that's why I want to read this now what could I do what could I say I say this my friend to every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that every person in here was healed when Jesus died at Calvary it's your possession I ask you to raise your hands who was Christians your hands went up everywhere you have a legal right to everything that Jesus died for he died for he died his death there at the cross and gave his life that you might have the legal rights to every redemptive blessing he died for it's yours you're just afraid to possess it you're afraid to claim it look when God told Moses go take the land it's yours but it's all fence with the Philistines and so on but said everywhere you set your feet he said to Joshua is your possession now why don't you do that tonight and we know the Lord died on the cross not that that will be physically healed but spiritually healed that's part of the atonement hallelujah so now every place you put your foot as your possession so you're going to physically go claim what God has given you I mean you can't just sit back and don't be comfortable with a complex why give the devil a door to manifest himself in you why give him an access point I mean why give him a point hey the devil's my enemy one person one thing I hate in this world is Satan and his working because he binds people down I mean brother have said the saddest thing he ever saw was an eagle in a cage because because God said yeah that's like many of God's children the Eagles they made to fly in the heavenlies for their cage by the traditions of man their case by pain by complex us friends the cage has been busted free I mean you don't have to sit there in a cage you can fly free if you so desire to polio why put up with the devil's work I mean you got to say devil I'm through every single part of your work I'm not you and me a finish I'm in this relationship was over I mean we've been divorced you be put away dead now for the tree whatever you want to say I'm done I'm with my new husband the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah and he's not gonna share me with you and I'm not interested I can't be bought because I've been bought with the price the price of the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah so we're gonna kick the devil off our Mountain friends we're gonna stop putting up with him hallelujah but the plumbers the devil comes you just like he came to Jesus in the will this is if they'll be prove it if they'll be and he puts you in this mind better you kind of stuck people get stuck in this well am i onto Emma and we look at well how successful or how good our walk may be no if God has called you if God has called you I just say yes I be he's made me this by His grace I am a man we're gonna take our god-given privilege this is the hour of Jubilee hallelujah so don't get comfortable you say well I've been this way for many years things can happen to us when we're very young and it can sit there in our whole life it comes into it hallelujah why do we have to put up with it amen so why don't we get rid of it now I'll Lou you so now brother Brown would come I'm just gonna I'm just gonna read this well actually it's really a few scriptures first actually no I'll read this first because you think well you're just preaching psychology no the Prophet went through this this is cool this isn't standing in the gap I'm sure we've all heard that I'm gonna read part of the story he said now so I got up about four o'clock and got started driving Billy was sleeping we went into a place and I was thinking on my mind you know what one of these days as soon as I can get the wife up there this is northern British Columbia you know he wanted he had plans to be become a what your Old Testament prophet live up in the woods away from everything because of how people were treating him he was responding to how people were treating him here was here was the messenger to the aged he wasn't just a you know just meet the Lord the day before he was the messenger to the he'd been through a lot of hardship if I knows his life story a lot of trials and here he was and he had gotten to a place you see the devil if he can just get you to agree with him then he's got you right and and he can put a thought at it and it could look it was so good right but it'll try and take you off the path and and you know it always agrees with your flesh it always agrees with this guy so whatever you've always wanted to be brother bear boys wanted to be a trapper and a hunter so he gets this idea in his mind I'm gonna go up in northern British Columbia no one really around I'm just gonna hunt here I'm going to be a guide why cause it appended to what he really wanted to be in his human nature and it's the same thing with us the same thing can happen well you say I'm not a hunter yeah but there'll be something and the devil get it in your mind all you've always wanted to do this and this and this it'll take you away from where God wants you to be I mean so now and I'm gonna tell her I love this place so well no need of us going anywhere let's just stay here and that's back from civilization eleven hundred miles from anywhere see way in the wilderness I thought boy won't that be fine I don't have to get a haircut I don't have to dress up I'll just be a regular Mountaineer that's what I've always wanted to be see now he's pandering to what he's always wanted to be and I said I've got some guns and some people give me and I'll guide like you've never heard of I'll just love it then if the Lord tells me to go down and tell somebody something all right now and tell them and come back again I'll help bud and we'll really have a real place here I was thinking on that so he still deals till late spiritual component we're still a religious component you have the Lord calls me I'll go so I'm gonna be here and there's how the devil comes in with reasoning cuz you know the Lord oh oh yeah oh I'll still be a believer I'll still do this now but it's gonna separate you away we went into a restaurant to eat a little place in the mountain about just about 11 sorry seven o'clock I was getting real I was getting a little late so I worked Billy up we were out of gasoline so I had to get some gasoline and when this little place this little restaurant and while there a man came across the street maybe a teeny but older than I was but he looked like a man to me he had a pair of overalls overall jacket riding boots a black cat whiskers down his face like this snow-white has his hair hanging out from under back of his hat I thought that looks like a man not some soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth about that long with a little bit of shorts on or around some patio or swimming pool some pot-bellied Easterner like excuse that expression but somehow the guy looked like a man to me hard rough look like he lives with God made man to live and I was admiring him and he came into the restaurant and ordered some pancakes and there and say there's about 15-20 people he had to sneeze and you know how some people will cut ass piece a little bit pardon me but he let out a big healthy good sneeze katroo my it looked like the windows blasted when he did it nobody did say nothing no sir I said Billy there is a man after my own heart see the devil always put something in front of you that you actually want to become if you start walking down a carnal way always does it look so appealing against it seems so right but it's so wrong and why what's happening it's because it's because of a detachment you lose your feeling for the people and that's why people isolate themselves as they lose a feeling from fellowship they lose a feeling for church you know they lose a feeling even for the lost and they just withdraw themselves but it can appear so spiritual because I'm out in the woods I'm out in nature with God but there's God wants you out in nature with him nothing wrong without being out in nature right but you don't want to separate yourself and be a man of isolation or a woman of isolation for that matter and you can be isolated sitting in your pew right here you can be a total Island to yourself right here right now because you can be living you can be you could have a massive family but you can be an individual in that family because you've detached yourself because of trauma trying to protect yourself by what's around you now so he came into the restaurant and ordered some pancakes iced over at that time Billy there's a man off I'm after my own heart he said Oh daddy you don't want to be like that's what that's me in the future see I said that's me and I sit there a little bit and Billy looked up at me and kept on eating his pancakes and I was finishing mine and a few minutes somebody in a booth right right around front of us where the board's this way a back of the booth I couldn't see around a man got up that looked exactly my profile about 75 years old little buddy fellow his clothes tied on him ragged and a buddy that got up with him was was Fletcher boy exactly gray hair hanging on his face and Billy looked around said daddy that looks like you and Fletcher you can imagine how I felt and the little fellow looked like me wobbled you they had been standing over a campfire with smoke all over them faces dirty I think their breakfast together the man must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of coffee or something my heart bounced within me and I watched and Billy said what's the matter with you I said nothing and I watched that and they went around and went out and he said daddy what's the matter with you I said nothing and he go in the car and then he said you mind driving again I said no he said I'm still sleepy so he went to sleep and I went speeding down the road about 55 miles an hour in the truck over the mountain coming on towards the border coming home to Arizona and I was coming now into Utah and as I got there coming down from the mountains about 20 miles an hour just as you heard of it as I told you about the morning about the squirrels and all these things was somebody went to talking with me a voice just the same as you as you hear mine I know it sounds neurotically but as I've got through expressing have I ever told you anything but what was right a voice got to talking I was talking to him it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that I said lord I don't want to be like that said your wife will go to she won't live up there in them hills like that and you'll become a bum just a you dreamed it just as your dreams show you would I said I don't want to be that I don't want to live like that I want to do something different but I was told that and he and you called me to be a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like a prophet but I was using my own my own excuse so I could hunt my own good amen and he said but that's what the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to a much higher office than that he said you've got more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel and an episodic form and you know of greater things many great gifts he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward being I seen and then said do you remember he told me do you remember what brother Robeson I mean yeah told you in your dream in his dream or vision that you have done like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go not to go that's wrong I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and God forbid that I'll try to compare the life of now like Moses that's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he came to deliver them so he just left him alone and went into the wilderness so God turned him around and he had long forgot the suffering people he said well I'm not a minister I'm not a messenger to an age but the thing is what did what did the Lord put his finger on the reason he was going that way is because he forgot the feeling of the people's amen and it's the same thing with us if we forget the feeling if we lose feeling for one another then we can be here in a church but you can be an individual as opposed to being part of a body amen and that will eventually member his mind started going and he then he wanted to say well this is how I'm gonna be and he had all laid out in his mind I'm gonna be up in the wilderness this is how it's gonna be but God even told her if you go that way you'll end like those two men you saw but brother Brown never envisage that he would end up that way he he had a wonderful picture in his mind he's going to be a hunter and a guide up on the wilderness his family's still going to be there if God calls him your guide of the world has said I say the Lord preach do whatever and go back but the devil only paints us a good picture the devil anoints our affection and he never looks at the negative that will happen are you following me because he paints a picture you can do this you can do this and where does it ultimately it leads you out from being part of the body of Christ and I want to talk about these four walls any part where the believers are God God has called us to be part of a fellowship right I believe we should all have a home fellowship right we should have a place where we're we're part of the body and God places us in that body wherever it is as the scripture says to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together for as much as you see the time approaching and we see the time is here hallelujah I'm glad the time is here so because the thing is we are not here for ourselves right the Christian life like our Lord Jesus did he come upon the earth for himself he came from glory for you right he died for your sins he took your place took your sins upon himself went to hell on your behalf see you don't need to go and then ascended on high victorious he lived for others and we're to be like Jesus he said this is very elementary this is very vital right so so we're not here I'm not here for myself you're not here for yourself we're here for one another we need one another I mean the body has to work in unity you know as as David says in the Psalms blessed as the unity among brethren it's like the anointing all that goes on you know off off Aaron's beard what so what he's saying is now Aaron had to be anointed to go into the Holy of Holies to serve in the high priests office and he's saying that when is unity among brethren that the body can function as it's meant to function hallelujah amen and that's how we should be and I believe we have unity but we should contently brotherly love continue I mean we should fight for what we have and we shouldn't just settle back where we should fight for more hallelujah why get comfortable we're not called to get comfortable I'll be comfortable in the Millennium and then and then when he turned he rolls on that's where I'm gonna rest let's press the battle while we're here why not why not amen so he forgot the feeling of the people because they were they the people didn't hear his message so because of how people were responding to the ministry then it made him hard and he lost the feeling of the people we're not to be like that season proverbs 18:14 the spirit of a man will serve sustain his affinity but a wounded spirit who can beer and and this is I've got it here a wounded spirit errs as same as a broken spirit and a wounded spirit who can beer beer means lift up made me so we are we are not immune from this so you know people can have wounded spirits you can be wounded amen but the thing is now what are you gonna do with the wood are you gonna nurse it are you gonna get healed I think healings a lot better than nursing a word amen people who get badly wounded they rush to A&E or they call an ambulance they want to get fixed hallelujah it's the same this is the house of deliverance a man proverbs 1819 a brother offended as harder to be one than a strong city and then contentions are like the bars of a castle I mean someone who's offended well the happens they put up a wall and he's saying it it's harder to to to win that person then conquer a city that's walled a strong city I mean why what's happening because people are hurt and they put up a wall Matthew 24:12 and because of iniquity and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold so because an iniquity is abounded in this age me too to know the truth and not do it iniquity has abounded in this age but because iniquity is abounding the love of I shall wax cold so it's the iniquity it will affect people and their love will wax cold because of what they see you following me this is what Jesus is saying in the end time this is what's going to happen right but we're not we're not called to let the iniquity of the world disable our faith because brother amp says either your faith will paralyze the world or the world will paralyze your faith it depends what you're going to do about it I would rather let my faith paralyze the world holy that's why we have god-given free is that the world is under our feet the devil's under our feet that we have dominion over everything hallelujah amen hallelujah likewise he husbands I'm just going to drop through a few of these but likewise he husband's dwell with them according to knowledge your wives giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered now to dwell with them according to knowledge is to understand their emotional state you following me amen it's not just a working relationship it's not just now your wife I'm husband this is how we do things no you've got to dwell with them according to knowledge right you've got to know you actually have to enter into their burdens and knees like they do the same with you you should be emotionally connected to your spouse wholly you shouldn't be separated that's wrong that's not becoming one flesh amen but the thing is now that's the challenge is to maintain the connection that's why many marriages fail well what is it's based on selfish love self-worth not real love but number two is because there's a there's a separation between the two before they actually physically separate there's a emotional separation why because they put up walls it's you know we are going to hurt one another amen I will disappoint you all right and you may disappoint me from Dondon because we're human right we are aren't we yeah I meant we're human we're people we're still we're redeemed people but we're people right so we will do Oh point one another it's inevitable you can't we can't help it we're all brother ham says that we still have the sticky nature this is first nature that we still have even though we have rapturing faith in our souls even though we are are an overcomer in here this faith sorry this flesh will disappoint us and it will disappoint yourself too amen the thing is now that doesn't mean we just put up walls and we you know separate ourselves we're not a bunch of individuals I mean we are the ransomed redeemed body of Christ by one spirit we're baptized into one body hallelujah so we have to always remember that Amen so and just like how I don't think I have it on here but but the Apostle Paul says in the book of Hebrews do not let a root of bitterness ether in where many are defiled why because life will make us either bitter every experience in life will make you better or bitter but it's your choice will you give it to the Lord and it will become bitter or will your life be bitter because of your experience it's your choice right just how just how you know in the Old Testament there were six cities of refuge where a man could run and a woman can run in right before the case was heard as a refuge the seventh is always Christ right so Christ is our refuge where is Christ today he's in his people program says deity is not inhibited sinew it's not just in heaven deity God as the Holy Ghost in you that's Jesus Christ in spirit form he's in you right so that means the city of refuge is in you right now if the City of Refuge is in you but the doors are closed because you can't enter into someone's need how can people get deliverance how can people get healing how can people get salvation right if the if the gate shut but if the gates open and you can enter into their need then a people can get refuge just say about the woman at the well she would have been a great city of refuge from any who who were walking the same footsteps that she had already walked right that's like all of us that's why we all have a different testimony we can be a City of Refuge if you want to be amen I don't want people to run into this place or come in contact with me and open their hearts and be disappointed right I want them to find what they are seeking which is the Lord it's not a gun to say Amen so it's those so we want to we don't want to be emotionally detached in this age that's fine now emotional detachment is as is defined as this and and then we'll I'll close emotional detachment can be a positive behavior because it allows a person to react calmly to highly emotional circumstances right so you can be too emotionally taxing everything's just emotion emotion emotion but it can be a good thing because you can actually look at things analytically without emotion getting involved so on one hand it's a good thing but emotional detachment and this sense is a decision to avoid too emotional detachment in this sense is a decision to avoid engaging emotional connections rather than an ability or difficulty in doing so this when you look at something without bringing emotions involved right but so so so typically for personal social or other reasons in this case since it can allow people to maintain boundaries mental integrity and avoid undesired impacts buyer upon others related to emotional demands such as deliberate mental attitude which avoids engaging the emotions of others but emotional detachment can also be emotional numbing or emotional blunting a dissociation depersonalization or in its chronic form a depersonalization disorder this type of emotional numbing or blending is a disconnection from emotion that is frequently used as a coping survival skill during traumatic childhood events such as abuse or severe neglect over time and with much use this can become second nature when dealing with day-to-day stresses now we have all been neglected to a degree in our childhood remember our childhoods weren't perfect you could even you have believing parents there's still something that wasn't quite perfect with its childhood amen and now I'm a parent I can say we do try our best right we really do and we can think we're doing everything well but in reality we're probably not because we're trying our best right and that's why it takes the lot to come and really be the parent through you that's the only way you can do it but the thing is now if someone if someone so to be neglected as a child that doesn't mean you just seen out on the street you gotta fend for yourself but you can be neglected emotionally that your parents do not emotionally connect with you you follow yep because that's why it's so important to have an emotional bond with your children I mean because their emotional needs are met by the parents until they get married in their emotional needs are met by this spouse amen so now so so it can be if there is severe emotional neglect then a person then a child will become emotionally detached because they don't know how to use their feelings in in relationship it's only a working relationship if there's no feelings right we don't want a working relationship with our family or with each other there should be an emotional attachment right we're all brothers and sisters in Christ right we all lit loved each other in the Lord right so this should be an emotional attachment between us and of course there should be an emotional attachment between husband and wife between parents and children it has to be that way but then the thing is then if we have been and we've all been you know our all of our upbringings have not been perfect then we will all to aid greevey emotionally detached some of us maybe or not some of us may be extremely are because of what has happened in our lives but we don't and it's a coping survival skill which which becomes embedded in us so people keep up a wall they're emotionally detached why is that it's a survival mode that they have become used to operating it and maybe they don't even realize it but we're not called to be that way right emotional detachment may allow acts of extreme cruelty such as torture and abuse support supported by the by the decision to not connect infant emphatically with the person concerned social ostracism such as shunning and parental alienation other examples where decisions to shut out a person creates a psychological trauma for the shunned party amen and that's why you know that's a thing in our Western world children and parents the family unit has been broken and the parents are doing their own thing brother Brown spoke about it even in the 50s and 60s Jimmy's out with his hot rod Mama's doing this daddy's doing this and the family's all broken so it's a bunch of individuals in a house it's not a family anymore and what does that create it creates parental alienation where the parent is alienated from their children yet they grew up in the same house yet they're in the same house amen and so what does that produce it produces in the child emotionally detached child you know we're not called to be a bunch of individuals in a house we're called to be a family I remember we bear one another's burdens we can open our you know our family should be in such a way where we should have total Liberty to open up all of our heart amen to our parents those children here or to our spouses those who America we should there should be total Liberty in our relationships to share whatever's on our heart right to really enter into one another's burden you know I say to the girl sometimes on the same tape you know when is a disagreement I think we're all on the same team yeah we're not fighting against each other all on the same team you know and we're all on the same team I mean it's not team dad and team mom and who's gonna vote you know we're all on the same team amen so this can happen now so but emotional detachment because what happens is how we are how we are raised and especially how al our dad relates to us as a child then subconsciously we will relate to God in the same way we will relate to God this way so if our father is overbearing and very de monitored and very you know very strict in that way we think God is a God of rules and very strict and we don't see his grace and his love we only see your a lineup or your shape up or ship out we only see that because that's how our Father was but then if our father is real you know wide and loose and she'll be writing whatever and distant and not there we think God's there way we think God doesn't care because it's become imprinted upon us how are we doing everyone yeah this is true whether we like it or not this is how we were late to God and it takes God to come and reveal himself there's nothing brother and you haven't listened to it but brother and on Wednesdays if we should pray that God's will is done yeah so we should pray that because prayer brother M says as it shouldn't be us it should be us asking God to change our will to match his will right so when the Lord reveals himself to us we can't look through a pre understood filter we say God hears your word reveal yourself to me through your word reveal yourself to me through the message I mean that I could actually have a relationship with you amen that's how these to be we say Lord yeah because we all have a preconceived idea of God before he reveals himself we'll have a idea we don't want I don't want to worship God based on my idea that's called an idol that's an idle people Cavs idols of Jesus there's many today but I don't want to worship God by an idol of an hour you know an idea I want to worship Him according to all of his work amen hallelujah so now so we can be emotionally detached from God and what happens is that we do things we we worship God because we know it is right only brother am says I believe in a heartfelt sky-blue sink killing religion hallelujah amen and and I say Amy I believe in a heartfelt sky-blue sink killing religion a many you know you know brother Brandon tells the story you know of you know I think you know there's a slave or saying in a slave owner and the slave meets the Lord and he said or to his boss where he says I've got half our religion you know and the bosses I don't believe in such a thing he said well I do you just haven't experienced it yet a man I believe in a heartfelt religion you see brother Branham and deep called the deep in front of thousands of people he just talks the Lord he finishes praying he wiped his eye says here oh sorry I just start crying like a baby when I talked to him he wasn't a shame and he was a man's man - hallelujah hey he wasn't a week but you know but he believed in a heartfelt religion and so we can't be emotionally detached from God because if we are emotionally detached to our family to our spouse we will be to him whether we like it or not and we'll only worship God because we know it's right as opposed to actually loving him believing him from our hearts we don't want to be like they're doing that's why the spirit of Lord is here to sit at liberty them that are bruised I mean to recover the side of the blind they meant to heal them you know I mean that's why it's here so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave it with that but I'm gonna invite you ask you a question don't let this world numb you and this is now now brother Isaac city preacher experience this was my experience this last year I became emotionally detached and it became a coping mechanism of how I lived because it's like because you because you retreat you know you get hurt misunderstands you just retreat and you say well and then you start coping and all could look maybe fine on the outside everything can be peachy appear to be but you've built a fortress and you built a bunker and there you are and you're and you're on the defense God can use someone on added in a bunker we're not called to build a bunker I don't it was a live underground we're not moles right there's a cynic hallelujah maybe it would but but that's what happens because pain comes in or misunderstanding comes in and we don't know how to deal with it many times so we just sit with it and then we build and and now we want to cope well how do we cope we we withdraw we're not call to withdraw this rivers of living water should flow amen went on a bunker right so so that's how I was so I'm sorry I've I've experienced what I'm talking about maybe no to a massive degree but this is this was still me but there comes a point where you say lord I don't want to be like this anymore because you start walking down a path we get but begin to get ideas well I can move here and I'll just make this Little Kingdom this little because you think of this little paradise and normally if you're kind what you think well how can you be alone with your family somewhere place somewhere you've always wanted to live because you just because you're planning in your mind a a world that you can actually have control of that nothing can hurt you in that world amen but that's why when the children of Israel came out of Egypt they crossed the Red Sea they walked for three days they found water it was bitter they came to a bit of a bitter experience and then Moses God told Moses to cut down a certain tree and put it in the water and the water became sweet so the experience became sweet and brother ham says is a cross that's been cut down there's a cross and if you mix any experiences with the cross I mean it will go from a bitter experience to a sweet one that's the secret when we really give it to him and let him do it because there is a power in this room I'm fully convinced there is the power of the crosses present that any bitter experience does not have to stay that way you have to mix your experience with the cross you have to take it to him and say Lord make it sweet and I will guarantee you the waters are sweet again [Applause] that's your choice I'm gonna leave it with you we have the musicians please can you come forward we don't have to be detached from this world or from each other or from our families we're not called to be isolated in our life you could be the most extroverted person that has ever been but you can be alone you can because it can just be a front we're not called to be like that you can be the most bubbly you be the life of the party but you can be withdrawn and emotionally detached you don't have to be that way if you don't want to you could be free if you so desire amens let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer and I want to say you're welcome to come for prayer but let's just pray as a group of people shall we gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you well I thank you that every worker the enemy comes to nothing in your presence Lord father you're the Almighty God you're the healer you're the Great Physician dear lord I just pray father as these words have gone forth this day lord I ask that Lord that we would

derail us tries to make us a shipwreck tries to Lord stop our faith but lord I think you'll hear you're determined that every man would return to their own position so father I just want to commit
