[34:20] than the angels for the suffering of
[34:22] death crowned with Glory and Honor that
[34:24] he by the grace of God should taste
[34:26] death death for every man for it became
[34:29] him for whom are all things and by whom
[34:32] are all things and bringing many sons
[34:34] unto glory to make the captain of their
[34:37] salvation perfect through sufferings for
[34:39] both he that sanctifieth and they who
[34:41] are Sanctified are all of one for which
[34:43] cause he's not ashamed uh to call them
[34:46] Brethren saying I'll declare thy name
[34:48] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[34:50] church will I sing praise unto thee and
[34:52] again I'll put my trust in him and again
[34:54] behold I and the children which God had
[34:56] hath given me and then Jeremiah probably
[35:00] very familiar piece of scripture here
[35:01] Jeremiah from verse 4 down to verse
[35:04] 9 says here and the word of the Lord
[35:07] came uh unto me saying behold I have
[35:10] formly in the belly I knew thee and
[35:13] before thou comest forth out of the womb
[35:15] I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[35:17] prophet unto the Nations then said I ah
[35:20] Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am
[35:22] a child but the Lord said unto me say
[35:25] not I am a child for thou shall go to
[35:27] all that I send theee and whatsoever I
[35:30] command thee Thou shalt speak be not
[35:32] afraid of their faces for I am with thee
[35:34] to deliver Thee sayith the Lord then the
[35:36] Lord put forth his hand and touched my
[35:38] mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I
[35:40] have put my words in thy mouth amen
[35:43] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[35:44] prayer this morning Remembered in prayer

[36:27] anoint speaker and hearer one more time
[36:29] lord we need you to take over every
[36:31] service Lord so may you take over this
[36:33] service may you have preeminence Lord
[36:34] may you be glorified Lord May every
[36:37] human Spirit be subject to you father
[36:39] may you have your way For Your Glory
[36:40] cover us in your blood Lord and may thy
[36:42] will be done Lord Jesus may you bless
[36:45] each one here and those who are
[36:46] streaming father those who are away be
[36:48] their portion Lord we commit Our Lives
[36:50] into your hands and ask these things in
[36:51] your name name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:54] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[36:56] have your seats this morning I want to
[36:58] talk about identified sons and whose
[37:00] sons are you that's the question so when
[37:03] I speak about Sons this morning I speak
[37:05] about sons and daughters so you know
[37:07] it's not just half of us who are being
[37:09] talked to but a son son in the Bible
[37:11] represents a position amen of of of
[37:14] authority and power right so I want to
[37:16] talk about who whose son who whose child
[37:19] are you this morning you may say well
[37:21] I'm the Son and Daughter of so and so
[37:23] your natural parents but that's not what
[37:25] I'm talking about God wants to take away
[37:27] our identity from our natural family
[37:29] sure we have our natural name our names
[37:31] do not change we honor our father and
[37:33] mother you we appreciate our parents but
[37:35] that's not that should not be our real
[37:37] identity that must not be our real
[37:39] identity even to have your identity in a
[37:41] church is wrong amen it is wrong you
[37:44] must not have your identity in sh oh I
[37:46] go to shik Tabernacle that doesn't mean
[37:48] nothing to God just like brother R said
[37:50] people say I'm Methodist I'm
[37:52] Presbyterian I'm Baptist he says that's
[37:54] that that doesn't even mean a snap of a
[37:55] finger to God we must go beyond that
[37:58] identity am mean because that identity
[38:00] will not stand in time of trouble I mean
[38:02] it will not help you in time of trouble
[38:05] cuz there'll become a time when you
[38:06] can't reach me you can't reach a deacon
[38:08] you can't reach a sister or a brother or
[38:09] someone and you need to stand alone with
[38:12] God Amen you must stand alone Toe to Toe
[38:16] with the Enemy with God on your side
[38:18] that's how you must be remember this
[38:20] walk is an individual walk sure we're a
[38:22] body but it's individual first and
[38:24] foremost and if you are just just here
[38:26] because of a group you will get nothing
[38:29] amen but if you are here because God has
[38:31] called you and he saved you by his grace
[38:33] you have everything amen because we read
[38:35] there in the opening scripture that he
[38:37] bring many sons unto glory amen so he's
[38:40] not talking about church people he's not
[38:41] talking about just people but his
[38:43] children he will bring unto glory amen
[38:45] that's why he died on Calvary to redeem
[38:47] us Amen to taste death amen that we
[38:49] don't have to taste death you know that
[38:51] we would we would be made in His image
[38:53] to really really we would become who we
[38:56] meant to be in the first place you know
[38:58] the Bible says we don't I don't have it
[38:59] on my notes but it says that we will
[39:01] know as we are knowing so I'm not
[39:03] knowing in Heaven by my natural birth my
[39:06] natural lineage my you know I'm not
[39:08] known by those things in heaven I'm
[39:10] known because I'm a Son of God I mean
[39:13] that's how I'm known in glory and this
[39:14] the same thing with you and I you're not
[39:16] known in in heaven because your parents
[39:19] were this person you came from this
[39:21] country that's not you know God allowed
[39:23] those things cuz he wanted a certain
[39:25] character to come forth out of you he he
[39:27] ordained all those things but that's not
[39:28] your all in all right we are the sons
[39:31] and daughters of the most high God we're
[39:33] not here to to to just continue a
[39:36] natural family line though we do that we
[39:38] have children we get married all those
[39:40] things but that should not be our
[39:41] identity our identity must be in the
[39:44] word of God our identification must be
[39:46] in the word of God it must not be in our
[39:48] natural traits it must not be in our
[39:50] church it must not be in our natural
[39:52] lineage and these things all those
[39:54] things will fall apart right our our
[39:57] identification must be in the word of
[39:59] God yes sir and I think it's so
[40:01] incredible you think about Jeremiah here
[40:04] you know Jeremiah um he was called the
[40:06] weeping prophet you know he he had a
[40:08] real hard job oh my but God first and
[40:11] foremost had to tell him I'm not calling
[40:14] you just because of you what you think
[40:16] you are before you ever in your mother's
[40:19] womb I ordained you to be a prophet to
[40:21] the Nations Jeremiah Jeremiah you must
[40:23] realize that you're not here just
[40:25] because I picked you just cuz I picked
[40:26] you but I for ordained you for this role
[40:29] I for ordained you to fulfill this word
[40:32] because Jeremiah when I told Moses that
[40:35] he told the people of Israel in the book
[40:36] of Deuteronomy you would have read it
[40:38] many times Jeremiah that I set the law
[40:40] of life and death before the people and
[40:42] if they cleave to me they'll live but if
[40:44] they don't cleave to me and they cleave
[40:45] to other things they will die and be
[40:47] taken out of the land Jeremiah when I
[40:48] spoke those things through Moses you
[40:50] were on my mind because I knew the
[40:52] people could not keep my law I knew my
[40:54] people could never do it cuz they there
[40:56] was nothing that would ever come out of
[40:58] the law that could change them that the
[41:00] word could be fulfilled in their lives I
[41:02] knew they would fail and I knew this
[41:04] would happen so I knew that one day a
[41:06] prophet would come and bring Mercy
[41:08] before that judgment would come God
[41:10] always brings Mercy before judgment said
[41:12] Jeremiah you have to know you're going
[41:14] to be in a very difficult time you're
[41:16] going to see a lot of Destruction you're
[41:18] going to see people you love go to ruin
[41:20] you're going to see Jerusalem be burned
[41:21] you're going to see terrible things
[41:22] happen but Jeremiah you must know I've
[41:25] ordained you for this drug
[41:26] that you will not be tossed to and fro
[41:28] by political moves and different things
[41:30] within the church and things going on
[41:32] the nation the economic trouble and
[41:34] whatever's going on Jeremiah you must
[41:35] know you're above those things because
[41:37] your identification Jeremiah is in me
[41:40] it's not in your culture it's not in
[41:42] your natural people it's not in the
[41:44] synagogue it's not in Jerusalem but it's
[41:46] in me the word of God am me he had to
[41:49] know those things that's why God said
[41:51] before you're in the belly amen I knew
[41:54] thee wow and i s ify thee ordain thee to
[41:57] be a prophet unto the Nations amen and
[41:59] friends we don't become the Sons and
[42:01] Daughters of God by the new birth that's
[42:03] right the reason we are born again is
[42:05] because we are that says in Galatians
[42:08] because ye are Sons you receive the
[42:12] spirit of God where you cry Abba Father
[42:14] because because God had to just destroy
[42:17] the legalistic idea out of the galatian
[42:19] church that came in out of because of I
[42:22] keep this therefore I am no the word
[42:24] lives in you because you are
[42:26] we don't become Sons and Daughters of
[42:28] God by the new birth we are therefore
[42:30] we're born again am amen we receive the
[42:33] spirit because we are right so we got to
[42:35] realize that you we got to realize that
[42:37] we're not in this thing just because you
[42:39] know Christianity cannot be just
[42:41] something we tack to our life that's
[42:43] right you know we can't we can't go to
[42:45] church because it's just something we do
[42:48] if if our Christian walk is just because
[42:50] well it's a good idea to be a Christian
[42:53] it makes good people you know these got
[42:55] nice friends we have good times and you
[42:57] know that's not that's not an
[42:59] identification that God's looking for no
[43:02] we've got to realize that we are part of
[43:05] the word we are part of the word right
[43:08] we don't just adopt a faith no we didn't
[43:12] choose God God chose us there's a scene
[43:14] from The Chosen Jacob's digging a well
[43:16] they're talking to these other people
[43:17] and you know these people are telling
[43:19] them about their gods and what they do
[43:20] and you know Jacob tells them the story
[43:22] about how he wrestled with God will come
[43:24] to that later and he's limping and all
[43:26] these things and you know and then and
[43:28] then the people asking why did you
[43:30] choose this kind of God and Jacob said
[43:33] no we didn't choose him he chose us amen
[43:35] there's a big difference right but the
[43:37] thing is we have to come to a place
[43:39] where we realize
[43:41] that we we aren't Christians because we
[43:44] adopt the faith but we are Christians
[43:47] because we're part of him what we're
[43:50] part of this word it's it's so much
[43:52] different than saying well I'm just
[43:53] going to adopt a faith and it's
[43:54] something good to live by
[43:56] that's got nothing to do with it you
[43:58] actually totally missed the whole point
[44:00] right the reason the word comes your way
[44:01] is because you're part of that word
[44:03] you're part of the prophecy like like
[44:05] Jeremiah was part of Prophecy he was
[44:08] there to manifest Mercy before judgment
[44:10] was coming he was part of what Moses God
[44:14] spoke through Moses see he wasn't just a
[44:15] prophet I may be laboring this point a
[44:17] lot but I just I just pray it would
[44:19] anchor into our lives that that we can't
[44:22] just adopt Christianity amen we are part
[44:24] of the word God wants you to realize
[44:26] that you're part of this word that's why
[44:28] you're called to it am mean that it's
[44:30] not just a nice idea or just you know a
[44:32] good thing that you want to do but no
[44:34] see faith is not faith is
[44:38] we joining church is not
[44:41] enough right we are the people of the
[44:43] book The Bible amen we are part of it
[44:46] you know when you realize you're part of
[44:47] it you can't deny him when you realize
[44:50] you're part of the Lord you can't deny
[44:51] him it's impossible to to to recant or
[44:54] rig or go away some else or adopt a
[44:57] whole different kind of a faith because
[44:58] you realize you're part of him how can
[45:00] you re how can you deny Part of Yourself
[45:03] how can you deny who you really are you
[45:05] cannot amen it's impossible that's why
[45:07] the martyrs could go to the stake and be
[45:09] burned and feed the Lions and things
[45:11] those who recanted they were never part
[45:13] of it they were just part of the group
[45:15] they saw the benefits of it they were
[45:16] feeding off the blessings that the
[45:18] Believers received but those who are
[45:20] really part of it who really had the
[45:22] Revelation I'm part of him and he's part
[45:24] of me I one with the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:26] they could not recant it was impossible
[45:28] there was nothing in them that could do
[45:30] it and it wasn't because of sheer force
[45:32] of willpower or stubbornness it was just
[45:34] because they were part of the word and
[45:35] the Word was part of them amen and it's
[45:38] got to be the same thing with you and I
[45:39] we need to realize that we're part of
[45:41] this message and mean we're part of this
[45:43] word amen when we don't just adopt it as
[45:45] something we tack onto our lives but you
[45:47] have the Revelation that God is my
[45:49] father amen amen that that I am his son
[45:51] or daughter amen I am named after him
[45:54] amen that we're not building a natural
[45:56] life anymore but actually it's God's
[45:58] God's kingdom being expanded upon the
[46:01] Earth you know you know in the in the
[46:03] Old Testament the word son one of the
[46:05] definitions is it's the builder of the
[46:07] family name wow so who's whose name are
[46:10] you building today are you building your
[46:13] own name you say well I've got to have a
[46:15] career and look after my family and all
[46:17] those things that's all part of life but
[46:19] that's not what I'm talking about what
[46:20] name see people who build who build
[46:23] kingdoms within the message they haven't
[46:25] had the re ation that Jesus Christ is
[46:27] their father they might have
[46:28] Supernatural Miracle the supernatural's
[46:30] got nothing to do with if a person's a
[46:33] true seed or not bam had true prophecy
[46:35] Judas had a Supernatural Ministry that
[46:38] even when Jesus they're all gathered
[46:40] around the last supper table and Jesus
[46:41] said one of you is going to betray me
[46:43] they didn't say oh it's
[46:44] Judas they were they said who is it Lord
[46:47] they did not know that's how close he
[46:48] was to the truth but he didn't go to
[46:50] Pentecost he cast out Devils he healed
[46:53] the sick he had a Supernatural Ministry
[46:55] but yet yet he wasn't
[46:57] seed so that's why that's why people who
[47:00] build kingdoms within the message they
[47:01] actually don't have the Revelation God's
[47:03] their father because they're building
[47:04] their own kingdom they're building their
[47:06] own family name it can be a name of a
[47:08] church or a Ministry but they're still
[47:10] building their own family name amen but
[47:12] if you get the real Revelation that God
[47:14] is your father and he and and you're his
[47:16] son or daughter you're not interested in
[47:18] your name going forth you're not
[47:19] interested in building your Empire and
[47:21] having your you know influence among the
[47:23] people you want God's influence to on
[47:26] people you want God's kingdom to be
[47:28] expanded you want to build his name upon
[47:30] the Earth isn't that right amen this
[47:32] should be our ambition in life that
[47:34] God's name would be expanded that you
[47:38] know the the family name would be
[47:41] built that's how it's got to be amen so
[47:44] Jeremiah was going to go through some
[47:46] tough spots but he had to realize amen
[47:49] that this was the most fundamental thing
[47:51] God first told him I've ordained you
[47:54] before you even turned up you built for
[47:56] this job I've I have made you purpose
[47:59] built but see Jeremiah no doubt would
[48:02] have had to deal with his natural
[48:03] Humanity strug because he say I'm just a
[48:06] child I don't know how to speak and
[48:07] God's telling you I'm not calling you
[48:09] because of your abilities I'm not
[48:11] calling you because of what you think
[48:13] you are I'm calling you because of what
[48:15] I know you really are I mean that's why
[48:17] we've got to get the humanity out of the
[48:18] way and let God move and God wants to
[48:20] strip away our human identity am mean we
[48:23] know that you know the you know the uh
[48:25] no we won't go there yet but but we know
[48:27] that yeah yeah we'll go there brother
[48:30] Paul read this on Wednesday you see
[48:34] Moses no yeah we'll go here I I thought
[48:37] we're going somewhere else we'll go here
[48:38] sorry Moses had to have a revelation
[48:41] that he was called for the
[48:43] job the people of Israel had to leave
[48:48] their slave mentality they had 400 years
[48:51] of slavery that's an intergenerational
[48:53] trauma if we want to give it a
[48:56] psychological label of this day
[48:58] intergenerational trauma but God wanted
[49:00] to show them your past is your past I'm
[49:04] going to take it away amen you are never
[49:06] meant to be slaves in Egypt this is not
[49:08] who you really are sure they talked
[49:11] about great Jehovah God coming and
[49:13] delivering them one day but when he
[49:14] really came it really changed things
[49:16] because it really showed who had their
[49:19] identity in the Lord and who had their
[49:20] identity in their slave mentality
[49:22] because when they came out of Egypt and
[49:24] God did great super natural things you
[49:26] know they came you know first sign of
[49:28] trouble they said well let's just go
[49:30] back to Egypt let's go back to our
[49:31] slavehood at least we had safety there
[49:34] they were their their their boys were
[49:36] being murdered they were being used as
[49:38] slaves they had a horrible life but yet
[49:39] they wanted to go back to that because
[49:41] that was their identity but Caleb and
[49:43] Joshua said let's go take the land right
[49:45] now it's ours why because their identity
[49:47] was in the word of God the promis for
[49:49] their day amen so they weren't they had
[49:52] the same slave marks they had the you
[49:53] know the scars the beatings all those
[49:55] things but yet but yet their identity
[49:58] was not in where they came out of their
[50:00] identity is where they're going into
[50:02] amen and that identity was the promised
[50:04] word for that day amen so so so you see
[50:08] here we need to realize that God as I
[50:10] said last Sunday that God is putting a
[50:12] difference between you know the
[50:14] Israelites or the Believers and the
[50:16] Egyptians which is the blood being
[50:18] applied and it's fundamental that we
[50:22] have the blood applied to our
[50:24] homes right we don't just have our
[50:26] natural this is how we should be
[50:28] naturally know the blood must be applied
[50:30] to our homes that our home should be a
[50:32] place where God is welcome amen that
[50:34] that that that family altars amen and
[50:37] are not a strange thing you know brother
[50:40] brah speaks about he he speaks about
[50:42] home life if you just go I was going to
[50:45] say Google that term in the message but
[50:46] you go search that term he says home
[50:48] life is running out it's getting you
[50:49] know on shallow Waters the Bible's not
[50:52] it's being neglected people don't read
[50:53] it together and pray and all these
[50:55] different things things but you see
[50:56] that's a fundamental thing that first
[50:58] and foremost that that there is a family
[51:01] altar in the home and not just as a
[51:03] family but individually we need our time
[51:05] with God we need to we need to worship
[51:08] the one that we came from amen amen it's
[51:11] very important you know some people put
[51:13] too much pressure or emphasis on the
[51:15] church doing everything and sure we have
[51:17] Sunday school we have different programs
[51:19] and things but it's got to start at home
[51:22] church starts at home you see the
[51:23] problem is a nickan will always put a
[51:26] pressure on the church to do everything
[51:28] just like it went from the instead of a
[51:30] spiritual worship of all the people that
[51:33] Spirit took the anointing off the people
[51:35] and put it on a priesthood so now the
[51:37] priest does everything the church has
[51:39] got to do everything you know we we're
[51:42] not called to be that way amen we have
[51:44] an individual walk with God God should
[51:47] be speaking to us through the week yes
[51:49] amen amen you should be able to read the
[51:52] word it should be able to minister to
[51:53] You song should Minister you the message
[51:55] should be a to minister to you he speaks
[51:57] to your life he gives you stability he
[51:58] gives you Revelation as you're walking
[52:00] along this should not be our only point
[52:03] of Revelation right here amen amen amen
[52:06] this is all part of it but but this is
[52:08] not the all be all and end all you know
[52:10] no he's meant to be the inside teacher
[52:13] yes sure we have teachers in the
[52:15] fivefold ministry but he's meant to be
[52:16] the inside teacher first and foremost
[52:19] that that that the Holy Spirit should
[52:21] take the word and teach it to your heart
[52:23] amen anchor it in there
[52:25] praise the Lord so we have a a right to
[52:28] apply the blood Amen to our to our homes
[52:31] have a home life there but you see
[52:35] now
[52:36] Israel as as now this is speaking of
[52:39] Jesus coming out of Egypt but in Hosea
[52:41] and um I think it's Hosea 11:1 it speaks
[52:44] about um Jacob coming out of Egypt out
[52:47] of Egypt I have called my son and
[52:49] brother bam says there's compound
[52:51] meanings in scripture so so Israel was
[52:53] the son of God coming out of egyp Egypt
[52:55] as a group but then the greatest son
[52:57] Christ Jesus himself came out of Egypt
[52:59] as well so God saw Israel as his son
[53:03] this is my family this is my child this
[53:05] is my son amen but you see you see they
[53:09] had to they had to be willing to let go
[53:11] of their slave mentality they had to be
[53:13] willing to let go of their trauma they
[53:15] had to be willing to let go of those
[53:17] things and take God at his word to move
[53:21] on Amen from where they came out of we
[53:23] have to be willing to count all things
[53:25] but dung it doesn't matter how great it
[53:27] may be how how how acceptable to the
[53:29] world our past was we got to count it
[53:31] all but dung that we may win Christ
[53:33] that's the words of the Apostle Paul
[53:35] amen we cannot have any nice thoughts or
[53:37] feelings about our past amen that that
[53:40] means it's still attached to you if you
[53:42] have any good things you know thoughts
[53:44] about it's got to be all kind of but
[53:45] dong and so Israel had to come to a
[53:48] place where they did not think of their
[53:50] slave mentality or the leaks and GS of
[53:52] Egypt as a good thing oh I used to do
[53:55] this it was so good for me no it was
[53:57] death I mean they're living under a
[53:58] death sentence and God wanted to call
[54:00] them out of that place place them in
[54:02] their own land where they would be the
[54:03] head and not the tail I mean they would
[54:05] walk in Freedom they would know their
[54:06] God they would they would walk in their
[54:08] inheritance what God allotted for them
[54:10] they would possess amen and that's what
[54:12] God wants us to possess every Divine
[54:15] promise but first you've got to realize
[54:17] you're a son or daughter of God you must
[54:19] have that Revelation it's so important
[54:21] that you realize you come from God and
[54:23] go back to God because if you do not
[54:25] realize that you'll be tossed to and fro
[54:27] Spirit comes into the home you'll be
[54:29] tossed by it things come things happen
[54:31] in the world you'll be tossed by it it
[54:34] doesn't toss me what's happening in in
[54:36] Israel or the Ukraine the economic
[54:37] problems of the world nothing of that
[54:39] bothers me because he is Jehovah
[54:42] Gyra brother Brown preached the most
[54:44] sermons he preached was Jehovah Gyra and
[54:47] you've got to realize the Lord will
[54:49] provide and he never normally provides
[54:52] it upfront I'll tell you this a few
[54:54] years ago go okay leading up to Camp I
[54:58] thought humanly we cannot pay for this
[55:00] thing how on Earth are we going to pay
[55:02] for camp we are going to be in the red
[55:04] red red red two years ago I would have
[55:07] said we can't have camp this year cuz I
[55:10] would have been panicking this year I
[55:12] keep saying to Christine I know a guy
[55:15] he's Jehovah Gyra he will provide and he
[55:19] provided amen he provided it was
[55:22] impossible humanly but God provided how
[55:24] did he do it he's Jehovah Gyra but the
[55:26] thing thing is you've got to walk with
[55:28] God he doesn't unfold everything that's
[55:31] that's not a faith walk Abraham said
[55:33] leave the land I mean God told him leave
[55:35] the land he didn't say well he didn't
[55:37] say well where am I going God and what's
[55:39] going to happen God and no he just
[55:42] walked and as he was walking God
[55:44] unfolded it see and what happened God
[55:48] but you've got to believe that he's
[55:49] Jehovah Gyra I can't have that faith for
[55:52] you I'm believing for you but you've got
[55:53] to have that personal faith
[55:55] amen that when no one else is praying
[55:57] for you you can stand there on the rock
[55:58] of Revelation say you're Jehovah Gyra
[56:01] your word says I've never seen the
[56:03] righteous forsaken or them begging bread
[56:06] Hallelujah you've got to have that
[56:08] Revelation you say well it's easy to say
[56:10] it when I've been
[56:13] there I know what I'm talking
[56:16] about my you know but God provided does
[56:21] he still provide
[56:23] absolutely we must have confidence that
[56:25] he is God he is God he's the one who
[56:29] made your body he's the one who made the
[56:32] next breath you're about to inhale he's
[56:34] the one who made the food you're going
[56:35] to have for lunch he made the clothes on
[56:37] your back the car you drive you say well
[56:39] he didn't physically made it he made the
[56:41] material of it all amen he could just do
[56:44] this the world could tumble out into
[56:46] darkness it would be frozen in a moment
[56:48] if he wanted to he can do whatever he
[56:49] wants he's God we serve the Supreme one
[56:53] who created heavens and earth amen and
[56:55] we are his children by his grace we are
[56:58] his children we are his sons and
[57:00] daughters but I trust that God will give
[57:02] you a revelation of this service I come
[57:04] from him and I'm going back to him and
[57:06] no matter what happens in life God's
[57:08] allowed it to prove himself in that
[57:11] trial amen shadra mesak abedo and Daniel
[57:15] they were they were young people when
[57:16] they went into went into uh Babylon they
[57:19] were young people I don't know 14 15
[57:21] around that age around there they
[57:23] weren't in their 20s they weren't old
[57:24] they weren't sit in their ways they were
[57:25] young people going through that change
[57:27] of life and maybe they're walking and
[57:29] maybe they just saw the destruction
[57:31] behind them I don't know but something
[57:32] in them said we're going to serve God
[57:34] Amen we're going to serve God sh at me
[57:36] sh you know we know their names would
[57:38] change to that but you know I don't know
[57:39] what they are right now and the Hebrew
[57:41] but you know they just said you know
[57:42] friends let's just serve God we're his
[57:46] children Abraham gave us this land and
[57:49] because of Disobedience because of you
[57:50] know our our four Bears turned to Idols
[57:53] all these things we've been kicked out
[57:55] but I believe we're going to come back
[57:57] we are Abraham's children you know what
[57:59] I love about serpent Seed doctrine it
[58:01] tells me I come from God
[58:03] Amen that's what I love about it because
[58:06] because Abel by Revelation knew it was
[58:09] the blood amen and all of God's children
[58:12] have a revelation it was the blood and
[58:15] they give themselves to the word of God
[58:17] in their season right C's line are
[58:20] religious but reject the blood why do
[58:22] they reject the blood because they
[58:24] reject the power of the Holy Ghost to
[58:25] change their lives that the word will
[58:28] put on flesh in them that's what they do
[58:30] amen so I love serpent seed it's not
[58:32] it's a positive cuz I realize if God
[58:34] moved on Abel and moved on all the
[58:36] Believers down Through the Ages amen and
[58:39] he's moved on my life the same way I
[58:41] realize if I if I track my lineage back
[58:45] there's a step from Adam to God
[58:47] hallelujah
[58:49] hallelujah glory amen that's right so so
[58:52] I like sery it gives me a lot of it
[58:54] gives me a lot of uh stability in my
[58:56] life because it actually shows me it's
[58:59] not him that willth or runneth but God
[59:01] that showeth Mercy amen says not yes I'm
[59:03] going to do it no it's just God's mercy
[59:05] why did you earn it did you deserve it
[59:07] did you Merit it no but I'm here hello I
[59:10] got called I realize I'm his son I
[59:14] realize I'm his child amen if I'm his
[59:16] child I can never be out of his care
[59:19] well what do you mean if the world's
[59:20] turned upside down you know the Apostle
[59:22] Paul had a very interesting Journey yeah
[59:24] you know he a very interesting life he
[59:26] would he would he would leave leave the
[59:29] Comforts of a Pharisee Bible School
[59:31] Seminary and and and he would trade it
[59:34] for a very rugged life a very
[59:36] Troublesome life he didn't have you know
[59:39] I've never heard a modern-day missionary
[59:42] report of someone being stoned you know
[59:45] being driven from City to City I haven't
[59:47] heard those kind of mission reports in
[59:48] this day and age doesn't mean it won't
[59:50] happen and doesn't mean there's not
[59:52] persecution and hardship but you know
[59:54] the Apostle Paul had a lot of trouble
[59:56] did it shake him no no did it phase him
[59:59] no he was chained to a you know it's
[1:00:02] amazing how we put circumstance we let
[1:00:04] circumstances be our God we let we let
[1:00:07] our current state be our God because and
[1:00:10] the and and I and I hate to say it but
[1:00:12] the problem is we forget that we're his
[1:00:13] children you see the Apostle Paul you
[1:00:16] know the Apostle Paul he was he was
[1:00:19] beaten he was Shipwrecked he was robbed
[1:00:21] he was in prison he was chained to a
[1:00:23] Roman soldier you know most of his
[1:00:25] Revelations he got he was chained to a
[1:00:26] Roman
[1:00:27] soldier he was this unbelieving guy he
[1:00:30] was chained to you think man there's no
[1:00:32] way God could talk to me in this place
[1:00:34] who's ever seen like Google the was it
[1:00:36] the mamine prison whatever he was in it
[1:00:38] ain't one of these underfloor heating
[1:00:41] three meals a day kind of places that we
[1:00:43] have in this country cold damp rat
[1:00:47] infested cockroach riddles you know they
[1:00:50] weren't nice to their prisoners they
[1:00:52] were nasty hey these things cost me
[1:00:54] money we're you we're you know they W
[1:00:57] you know cold dripping ceiling all kinds
[1:00:58] of stuff in the dark chain to a Roman
[1:01:01] soldier or a wall or whatever but in
[1:01:03] that state he got many books of the
[1:01:07] Bible why because his circumstances
[1:01:10] weren't his God see humanly every
[1:01:14] circumstance becomes someone's God if
[1:01:17] they're doing good they can run around
[1:01:18] the church and praise God and testify if
[1:01:21] everything's going bad they wonder why
[1:01:23] they're even here and what's the point
[1:01:24] and trying why because it's circumstance
[1:01:27] driven we aren't called to be driven by
[1:01:30] circumstance see Caleb when when the
[1:01:33] word came Caleb's way he said that
[1:01:36] land's mine yes God revealed it to me am
[1:01:39] I'm his child Joshua we're going in now
[1:01:42] we actually know Caleb was a gentile do
[1:01:44] you know that but because he took God at
[1:01:46] his word God put him gave him
[1:01:49] inheritance God gave him a City of
[1:01:50] Refuge Amen to have a dwelling place but
[1:01:53] you see Caleb wasn't n faced by the he
[1:01:55] was in the same sandstorms that the rest
[1:01:57] of Israel were in he was eating the same
[1:02:00] manner having the same trouble having
[1:02:01] the same problems but his circumstances
[1:02:04] didn't dictate to him his victory amen
[1:02:07] no his the only thing that dictated to
[1:02:09] him his victory was God has given me a
[1:02:11] promise God has given me an inheritance
[1:02:13] and I'm going to possess that land I
[1:02:15] don't know how old I'll be but I'm going
[1:02:17] to get there Hallelujah but that's mine
[1:02:20] it was revealed to him he wasn't hoping
[1:02:21] it was his he knew it was his and so
[1:02:24] there for the sand blew in
[1:02:27] Hallelujah this is not my final resting
[1:02:29] place am amen the Mana comes I don't
[1:02:32] know Strife maybe the whole
[1:02:33] neighborhood's just grumpy Avenue you
[1:02:36] know fussing fussing Avenue or something
[1:02:38] everyone's complaining about the sand
[1:02:40] and Moses and all these troubles and all
[1:02:42] these things and he opens his tent door
[1:02:44] says hallelujah I'm one day
[1:02:47] closer and maybe they think man this
[1:02:49] guy's a crazy man no he was the only one
[1:02:52] that had his mind because of it wasn't
[1:02:55] his circumstances that dictated to him
[1:02:57] how happy or sad he was it was the word
[1:03:00] of God revealed to him personally gave
[1:03:03] him the victory amen and it's the same
[1:03:06] thing with Paul he was you know he had
[1:03:08] all this trouble in his life he says
[1:03:09] None of these things move me why because
[1:03:12] he realized because before he was a
[1:03:13] Pharisee of the Pharisees so his
[1:03:15] identification was in his ability to
[1:03:18] learn the scripture but then when God
[1:03:21] met him on the road to Damascus his
[1:03:22] identification was in the pillar fire
[1:03:25] wasn't the one that gave the Old
[1:03:27] Testament that he studied and tried to
[1:03:28] further himself in so he realized I'm a
[1:03:31] Son of God hallelujah more than a son of
[1:03:34] Abraham I'm a Son of God Amen and so so
[1:03:38] therefore he could say none of these
[1:03:40] things move me and I I pray we can have
[1:03:43] the same kind of Revel I believe we can
[1:03:46] you know we can walk in this world and
[1:03:47] the world can fall apart but we can
[1:03:48] still be
[1:03:50] rejoicing we can walk in this world that
[1:03:52] even our own family ion turns against us
[1:03:54] but yet we can
[1:03:56] Rejoice amen because you got to realize
[1:03:59] there's many times you know Believers
[1:04:00] want to quit but they can't
[1:04:03] quit Jeremiah came to a spot where he
[1:04:06] says I'm not even going to talk anymore
[1:04:09] I've been rejected too
[1:04:11] much but then he said you know he says
[1:04:13] I'll not make mention of him nor speak
[1:04:15] anymore in his
[1:04:16] name now this is discouragement this is
[1:04:19] more than having a bad day it's more
[1:04:21] than having a bad day at the office this
[1:04:23] is real discouragement
[1:04:24] but his word was in my heart as a
[1:04:26] burning fire shut up in my bones so it's
[1:04:29] like a bubbling stream it was within him
[1:04:30] he couldn't contain it he couldn't
[1:04:32] contain the word he couldn't contain God
[1:04:34] in his own life it had to come out even
[1:04:36] though his his Humanity wanted to put a
[1:04:38] stopper on the bottle amen there's so
[1:04:40] much pressure that thing just came out
[1:04:43] Hallelujah why cuz his word was in his
[1:04:44] heart as a burning fire shot up in his
[1:04:46] bones am mean see that this is how we
[1:04:49] should be I mean that when we gather on
[1:04:51] one another should be the Lord is so
[1:04:52] good his promises are real I me he's so
[1:04:55] good to us how is your week it was
[1:04:57] terrible naturally but spiritually he's
[1:04:58] awesome Amen he's in control of
[1:05:00] everything I've seen him be more
[1:05:02] faithful and true in my entire life
[1:05:05] right now that I have in my entire life
[1:05:07] because he's so good he proves himself
[1:05:09] over and over and over again and I can't
[1:05:12] believe that the Lord brought me through
[1:05:14] that trial I'm so thankful he's still
[1:05:16] alive he's so good amen why are you
[1:05:18] happy because I've met him amen that's
[1:05:21] right amen why can you rejoice in the
[1:05:23] midst of trouble because I know the god
[1:05:26] who's allowed the trouble I know the God
[1:05:28] who will bring me through the trouble
[1:05:30] amen and I was weary with forbearing so
[1:05:33] that's basically not speaking and I
[1:05:35] could not
[1:05:36] stay so because he tried to stop he got
[1:05:40] weary we got to let the goodness of God
[1:05:43] Out friends amen we should talk about
[1:05:46] his goodness amen but you see you see
[1:05:49] God knew that Jeremiah would come to the
[1:05:51] spot when he called him that's why he
[1:05:53] said look
[1:05:54] I ordained you before you ever
[1:05:57] born
[1:05:59] amen you know it's amazing Jeremiah's in
[1:06:02] prison the second time this is I think
[1:06:03] shortly before the destruction of
[1:06:05] Jerusalem and all these things so here
[1:06:07] he is standing in prison he's had years
[1:06:09] of rejection he's had years of rticle
[1:06:11] he's had years of
[1:06:13] problems but yet the Lord says call unto
[1:06:15] me and I'll answer thee and show thee
[1:06:17] Great and Mighty things which thou
[1:06:18] knowest not Hallelujah see many times we
[1:06:22] think we got to have a cup of coffee and
[1:06:24] the the setting's got to be just right
[1:06:26] no pressure in life and now God could
[1:06:28] I'm ready God you can speak to me Lord
[1:06:30] I'm I'm so ready I got my journal pad
[1:06:32] and you know everything's ready I got a
[1:06:34] tape playing and you know whatever more
[1:06:36] you want no God don't work that way God
[1:06:40] reveals himself in trouble amen God
[1:06:42] reveals himself in hardship God reveals
[1:06:45] himself in Affliction and mean that's
[1:06:47] where he reveals himself he doesn't
[1:06:48] reveal himself where all the padded
[1:06:49] pillows and everything's nice no it's in
[1:06:52] it's in the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:06:54] God is in that fire amen it's in that
[1:06:56] time of trouble that's where he comes on
[1:06:58] the scene that and we want to shun and
[1:07:01] run away from those things because this
[1:07:02] world we have this curse of soft living
[1:07:04] in this country that we don't want to
[1:07:07] come into those things and we think
[1:07:08] we're you know God Has Lifted his hand
[1:07:10] of blessing because we've stepped into
[1:07:12] trouble you know brother Ram says that
[1:07:14] God you go through a trial because God's
[1:07:16] accounted you
[1:07:18] worthy you found favor with God that's
[1:07:20] why you go through a trial job found
[1:07:22] favor with God God testified about job
[1:07:26] to to the devil his his his arch enemy
[1:07:28] he's a perfect man Satan this guy's
[1:07:31] perfect amen I can't tell that about you
[1:07:33] but this guy's perfect there's none like
[1:07:35] him he's my son you see and so God job
[1:07:39] found favor with God now what how did
[1:07:41] job find that favor because he had full
[1:07:43] confidence in the shed blood of the Lamb
[1:07:46] amen how about you and I friends see we
[1:07:49] try and bring things into our own
[1:07:51] ability when we think God doesn't have
[1:07:53] the ability
[1:07:54] we try and bring things under our own
[1:07:56] control and try and manipulate things
[1:07:57] and make things work when we think God
[1:08:00] doesn't can't do it may we never may we
[1:08:04] just may may we not do that anymore amen
[1:08:07] oh I've really got to do something about
[1:08:08] this brother says so many times someone
[1:08:10] starts acting up have you prayed for
[1:08:12] them go away and pray for them you know
[1:08:15] don't just ball them out don't no no go
[1:08:16] and pray for
[1:08:18] them amen let God do
[1:08:20] it praise the Lord now
[1:08:25] see the 70 would return to Jesus after
[1:08:29] they've been given power to cast out
[1:08:30] devils and things are rejoicing and all
[1:08:32] those things but he says Now Behold I
[1:08:35] give I give unto you power to tread on
[1:08:36] serpent scorpions over all the power of
[1:08:38] the enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:08:40] hurt you not withstanding in this
[1:08:41] Rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:08:44] unto you but rather Rejoice because your
[1:08:45] names are written in heaven amen now we
[1:08:48] know that Judas was among them and we
[1:08:50] know that you know some names now not
[1:08:52] out of the Lamb's Book of Life life but
[1:08:54] out of The Book of Life some names can
[1:08:55] be taken out but I I don't want to dwell
[1:08:57] on those negative things but the thing
[1:08:58] is Jesus was telling them actually
[1:09:00] Rejoice don't rejoice in those things
[1:09:03] because I've given you dominion over
[1:09:05] things but Rejoice that your names are
[1:09:07] written in heaven amen so so before now
[1:09:10] I'm just going to take this as just from
[1:09:11] the L's book of life now so remember
[1:09:14] before there was trouble your name was
[1:09:16] written on the L's book of life before
[1:09:17] there was sickness before there was
[1:09:19] trouble before there was heartache
[1:09:21] sorrow pain or any sin or any devil the
[1:09:24] lamb was slam before the foundation of
[1:09:25] the world and your name was written with
[1:09:27] his own blood on his book am amen so so
[1:09:31] now if your name has been written there
[1:09:33] amen then nothing can take it off amen
[1:09:35] there's no there's no amount of rubbing
[1:09:37] compound in the world Amen can take your
[1:09:40] name out of that book amen there's
[1:09:42] nothing no man can rub it out so I'll
[1:09:44] say If no man can rub it out no devil
[1:09:46] can rub it out no trouble can take it
[1:09:48] away amen there's nothing there's
[1:09:50] nothing that that can come upon the
[1:09:52] Earth every demon hell can't can't take
[1:09:54] your name out of that book if God has
[1:09:56] written it there now so if God has
[1:09:58] written my name in heaven that means my
[1:10:01] real identification is in heaven right
[1:10:04] it's not upon the Earth amen it's not
[1:10:05] with what's trending hashtag and
[1:10:07] whatever social media platform that's
[1:10:09] going on it's not in Crazy Town Tik Tok
[1:10:11] whatever more my my identification is
[1:10:13] not in those things it's in heaven amen
[1:10:16] so if my identifications in heaven then
[1:10:18] what should I be upon the Earth amen I
[1:10:21] should not be just a natural person
[1:10:23] being tossed to and fro right we got to
[1:10:25] go beyond those things God wants to take
[1:10:27] us higher today am he wants to take us
[1:10:29] above the storm amen he wants to take us
[1:10:31] above trouble that we could we could
[1:10:33] just rest in his ability don't you think
[1:10:36] God can do it amen if God could save you
[1:10:38] and you're his enemy don't you think he
[1:10:40] can heal or he can provide or he can you
[1:10:42] know yep you think he can amen so we got
[1:10:46] to really put that faith into action and
[1:10:47] really trust him amen amen see many
[1:10:50] times we turn to everything else but God
[1:10:52] and then we turn to God at the end why
[1:10:54] because we don't think he can do it in
[1:10:56] the first place but if we thought he
[1:10:58] could do it in the first place we'd turn
[1:10:59] to him before he turned to everything
[1:11:01] else see like the disciples on the you
[1:11:03] know Jesus asleep in the boat the storm
[1:11:05] rages remember they Master Sailors they
[1:11:07] they were basically born on that Lake
[1:11:09] they cut their teeth on the you know you
[1:11:11] on the side of the ship you know they
[1:11:13] they were raised on that sea they were
[1:11:15] Master Sailors so don't you think they
[1:11:17] would have okay trim the sail here rob
[1:11:19] it here let's move the weight this side
[1:11:22] you know Peter is your you know the
[1:11:23] waves come go bow down through the wave
[1:11:25] and up so you don't you know submarine
[1:11:27] in and you know all those things they
[1:11:29] would have tried all of their skills why
[1:11:31] didn't they just call the master first
[1:11:33] because they thought they could do it
[1:11:35] they thought they had knowledge to
[1:11:37] control the circumstances but the one
[1:11:39] who made the wind and the waves and the
[1:11:41] Sea and everything and then the whole
[1:11:42] world the whole universe was asleep in
[1:11:44] the boat with them why didn't they just
[1:11:46] say master the storm is here help us we
[1:11:49] need
[1:11:49] you because they thought their human
[1:11:52] ability could Master the circum
[1:11:54] irance and then they came to him and
[1:11:56] said don't you care that we perish so
[1:11:59] Lord aren't you mindful don't you see
[1:12:01] we're going down with the ship can't you
[1:12:03] see we're in trouble Lord if you really
[1:12:05] were God wouldn't you stop why do you
[1:12:06] allow this to happen and Jesus could
[1:12:09] said children right I've been here the
[1:12:11] whole time why didn't you call me on the
[1:12:13] scene why are you trying to save
[1:12:15] yourselves when you can't save yourself
[1:12:18] why are you trying to do this in your
[1:12:19] own strength don't you know I'm the
[1:12:21] Christ Peter I told you amen that it
[1:12:24] wasn't me that revealed it my Father in
[1:12:26] Heaven revealed this unto thee that I'm
[1:12:28] the Christ and yet you you're trying to
[1:12:29] do it in your own strength that you know
[1:12:30] I'm the Christ don't we know this
[1:12:32] message is the Lord it is Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] revealed don't we know this is God in
[1:12:37] print form don't we know his spirit
[1:12:39] moves among us day after day week after
[1:12:41] week service after service don't you
[1:12:43] know he moves among us he's calling us
[1:12:45] calling us higher above these things
[1:12:47] don't you know he's in the boat with you
[1:12:49] I mean don't you know the one who called
[1:12:51] you in the beginning is still with you
[1:12:52] right now we see you to the end so if
[1:12:54] he's there in the beginning right here
[1:12:56] and we'll call you to the end why not
[1:12:57] wake him up why not place your problems
[1:13:01] in his feet instead of saying you do but
[1:13:03] really holding on to it see you've got a
[1:13:06] full committal brother BR says one of
[1:13:08] the most powerful things upon the planet
[1:13:10] as a full committal to God when you
[1:13:12] actually commit things to God it's not
[1:13:14] just God you got to help me then you try
[1:13:15] and do it maybe Peter was under his
[1:13:17] breath saying Jehovah God help me as I'm
[1:13:19] sailing no he wasn't trusting God cuz if
[1:13:21] he really was he would have woken up the
[1:13:23] Master he would have woken God up in his
[1:13:25] boat yeah
[1:13:27] oh I know what it's like to be sailing
[1:13:29] and see your boat do Ford rolls as you
[1:13:31] get spat out the side I've done it it's
[1:13:33] fun but I knew I wouldn't
[1:13:38] die these guys thought they were going
[1:13:40] to die and they're blaming God don't you
[1:13:42] care it's because they tried to have it
[1:13:44] in their own strength people blame God
[1:13:47] too much why do we blame God for our
[1:13:49] trouble he's what remember he doesn't
[1:13:51] Force you he doesn't say now you're a
[1:13:54] robot and now you're a robot a Christian
[1:13:56] robot that has no self ability has no
[1:13:59] has no free will he never works against
[1:14:02] your free will when you gave your life
[1:14:04] to him he didn't force you you said Here
[1:14:06] I Am Lord forgive me a sinner save me
[1:14:08] wash me I'm I'm sorry Lord here I come
[1:14:10] it was your free will that brought you
[1:14:14] know that that you gave over to him then
[1:14:17] why do we take our free will back why do
[1:14:20] we do that why can't we trust them
[1:14:25] why can't we trust him we should trust
[1:14:27] him I think the Lord's just saying trust
[1:14:28] me trust me it's dark but trust me I
[1:14:31] mean there's a lot of Gloom but trust me
[1:14:33] the world's falling apart but can you
[1:14:35] trust me see there's got to be a faith
[1:14:37] upon the Earth of a people that can
[1:14:39] trust him in everyday situations not
[1:14:41] just praising God and Shout oh the seals
[1:14:43] are open all these great things what is
[1:14:45] that really to do you can trust him he's
[1:14:48] unveiled himself more in this age than
[1:14:49] any age amen what does it really mean we
[1:14:52] can trust trust him more we can have
[1:14:54] more faith in him amen his power and
[1:14:56] ability I believe we know there's not a
[1:14:58] strong part or a weak part of God but I
[1:15:01] believe his ability is is the greatest
[1:15:03] that's ever been upon the Earth because
[1:15:05] there is a people now that will walk
[1:15:07] from this world to the next world not
[1:15:09] just Enoch one Enoch you know I used to
[1:15:12] think that Enoch just lived in some kind
[1:15:14] of little Hut there and the you know
[1:15:16] just this idilic scenery that was his
[1:15:18] life just a postcard no trouble the
[1:15:21] birds away chirping the the sun was
[1:15:23] always shining and he just had like a
[1:15:25] picnic kind of a life no he had a lot of
[1:15:27] trouble in his life the world was
[1:15:29] falling apart he had a lot of things
[1:15:31] going on that he couldn't solve but he
[1:15:34] walked with
[1:15:36] God can we do that God wants you to walk
[1:15:39] with him Lord what do you want of me
[1:15:41] today just walk with me through the day
[1:15:43] just commit your day into just commit
[1:15:46] your day into his hands and let him
[1:15:48] organize it you so many times like
[1:15:50] Christine would say she's got all these
[1:15:51] things in her schedule to do the day and
[1:15:53] doesn't know how to fit ital she she
[1:15:55] just prays and says Lord you organize my
[1:15:57] day amen and it just all falls into
[1:16:01] place
[1:16:02] supernaturally why trust praise God amen
[1:16:09] amen see the two on the way to
[1:16:12] emus their life had fallen apart
[1:16:15] seemingly
[1:16:17] humanly cuz their Messiah had been
[1:16:20] crucified the church treasure commed
[1:16:23] suicide and all the ministry had H them
[1:16:25] up in an upper room somewhere their
[1:16:27] whole life had fallen apart see in those
[1:16:30] days to to follow Jesus meant you
[1:16:33] orchestrated from ostracized from every
[1:16:35] part of society you were one of them you
[1:16:39] couldn't hide it you couldn't be a
[1:16:40] secret believer you were one of them so
[1:16:43] it wasn't a small thing they counted the
[1:16:45] cost my Village is going to reject me my
[1:16:48] Rabbi won't look at me no more the
[1:16:50] Pharisees will hate me my family will
[1:16:53] misunderstand me and probably reject me
[1:16:55] they counted all the cost cuz they saw
[1:16:57] this man was more than a rabbi this man
[1:17:00] was more than a Prophet this man was the
[1:17:02] god of the prophets and so they gladly
[1:17:05] followed him but you see now because he
[1:17:08] wasn't on the inside of them yet when
[1:17:11] when everything seemed to be going
[1:17:12] upside down they were caught up in it
[1:17:16] they weren't skipping to a mass before
[1:17:18] Jesus turned up they weren't skipping
[1:17:20] along and then he comes along and says
[1:17:22] what's happened they said the greatest
[1:17:24] thing oh my it's
[1:17:26] Sunday Hallelujah Friday what happened
[1:17:30] the Lamb of God took my sin up Calvary
[1:17:35] Hallelujah this is a different kind of a
[1:17:37] Passover this was the greatest one amen
[1:17:39] he was Emmanuel we walked with him we
[1:17:41] spent time with him never a man spake
[1:17:43] like this man and then he was taken by
[1:17:46] wicked men he told us this would happen
[1:17:47] you know he told us we believed them
[1:17:50] they weren't talking like this we know
[1:17:51] this right here comes the lamb I
[1:17:54] couldn't change myself no amount of
[1:17:56] blood of bulls and goats and things that
[1:17:58] I could sacrifice ever changed me but
[1:18:00] this man's word changed my heart and
[1:18:03] then our hero went up Calvary he gave us
[1:18:06] life his blood was shed the perfect
[1:18:08] Lamb's blood was shed for me then he
[1:18:11] went to the tomb but he said he's going
[1:18:12] to come out again hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:15] and then Sunday it's Sunday and the
[1:18:17] tomb's empty at Sunday the angel of the
[1:18:19] Lord came down a Sunday the Romans fell
[1:18:21] down as dead men at Sunday the stone
[1:18:24] rolled away at Sunday he rose triumphant
[1:18:27] Hallelujah they weren't talking like
[1:18:29] that they were
[1:18:30] brokenhearted they were downcast who's
[1:18:33] ever had that feeling like a lead
[1:18:34] balloon in
[1:18:35] your they had about 10,000 million of
[1:18:37] them they're carrying around that kind
[1:18:39] of feeling yeah what do we do
[1:18:42] now we thought he was the Messiah the
[1:18:45] whole world fell apart you just just
[1:18:47] guard me in a journey okay the whole
[1:18:49] world fall apart and then he came along
[1:18:53] and said what's going on why are you sad
[1:18:56] and they're all so so they're not
[1:18:57] skipping and
[1:18:59] jumping you know then they begin to say
[1:19:01] you know this was uh you know we thought
[1:19:03] he'd be the Christ and all these
[1:19:05] things and then and then Jesus came
[1:19:08] along and said oh fs and slow of heart
[1:19:11] to believe all that the prophets have
[1:19:13] spoken you see at the moment see at this
[1:19:16] stage their identity was with was with
[1:19:19] god with
[1:19:20] them you can't just have an identity
[1:19:22] with God with you he must be in you in
[1:19:25] order to have a real identification that
[1:19:27] you're a son or daughter of God he must
[1:19:28] be in you that's why being part of a
[1:19:31] church that is god with you why because
[1:19:33] the spirit comes down the spiritful
[1:19:35] Believers Among Us right so that's god
[1:19:37] with you so your identification is with
[1:19:39] them so when everything's going good as
[1:19:40] a collective praise God but when things
[1:19:43] go hard what's oh no what's going on but
[1:19:46] you see your identity begins to swing
[1:19:48] because it's God with you right and this
[1:19:50] is how these guys were they had god with
[1:19:53] them hey it's great to have God with you
[1:19:56] that's incredible blessing you got the
[1:19:57] creator of heavens and earth the Lord Of
[1:19:59] Glory with you that's amazing but he
[1:20:00] doesn't want to just be with you he
[1:20:02] wants to be in you amen that's why
[1:20:04] that's why he died on Calvary that his
[1:20:06] blood would cleanse a people that he
[1:20:08] could dwell in them once again amen so
[1:20:11] so so then he began to say full slow of
[1:20:14] heart to believe all the prophets have
[1:20:16] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:20:17] these things to enter into his glory and
[1:20:19] beginning at Moses and all the prophecy
[1:20:21] expounded unto them and all the
[1:20:23] scriptures are things concerning himself
[1:20:25] now brother Braham speaks about this and
[1:20:27] events made clear by prophecy he said
[1:20:29] now let's let's go back a few minutes
[1:20:31] now let's listen to the words quoted
[1:20:33] from himself watch here the word itself
[1:20:35] quoting the word of himself the word
[1:20:38] itself quoting the word of himself not
[1:20:40] tell them what he was but just let the
[1:20:42] word speak for itself then they know who
[1:20:44] he was the letter of the word quoting
[1:20:47] the word the word in flesh quoting the
[1:20:48] word of letter being fully identified
[1:20:50] with himself amen look here now let's
[1:20:53] listen to him quote now we know that
[1:20:56] they were all briefed of the late
[1:20:57] happenings of this of the crucifixion of
[1:20:59] the story of the Resurrection the tomb
[1:21:01] as we just read now he goes straight to
[1:21:03] the word of prophecy about himself now
[1:21:06] let's just think that he said this he
[1:21:08] said a lot more than this but watch let
[1:21:10] them hear turn over to Zechariah 11:12
[1:21:13] wasn't the Messiah to be sold according
[1:21:15] to the prophet for 30 pie of silver you
[1:21:17] just said this man was sold for 30
[1:21:18] pieces of silver now turn over now
[1:21:20] you're getting them scriptures Zechariah
[1:21:22] 11: 12
[1:21:23] then he said did you notice that David
[1:21:24] said in the psalm Psalms 41-9 he was he
[1:21:27] was be betrayed by his friends then
[1:21:29] again in Zechariah 13:7 he is forsaken
[1:21:31] by his disciples and in Psalms 3511
[1:21:34] Accused by false Witnesses you just said
[1:21:36] he was Isaiah 53:7 he was done before
[1:21:39] his accusers Isaiah 50 and6 they
[1:21:42] scorched him the prophet said Psalms 22
[1:21:44] he was he was to cry on the cross my God
[1:21:46] my God wise th forsaken me did he do
[1:21:48] that the day before yesterday afternoon
[1:21:50] Psalms 22 again um uh 18 his garments
[1:21:54] reparted among them did they do that and
[1:21:56] Psalms 2278 mocked by his enemies the
[1:21:59] church psalms 22 again there wouldn't be
[1:22:01] a bone in his body to be broke but they
[1:22:03] pierced my hands and my feet he said
[1:22:05] holding his hands behind him no doubt at
[1:22:06] the time Isaiah 5312 said he would die
[1:22:09] between Mal factors Isaiah 53:9 said to
[1:22:12] be buried with the rich Psalm 16:10 said
[1:22:14] I'll not leave a soul in Hell neither
[1:22:16] will I suffer my Holy One to see
[1:22:18] corruption and was not Malachi 3 the
[1:22:21] Forerunner of this man I'd like to heard
[1:22:23] him quote that look at the prophecies
[1:22:25] notice when all the types he might have
[1:22:28] went through about Isaac in Genesis 22
[1:22:30] how God foreshadowed Isaac how um how
[1:22:33] Father Abraham took his own son packing
[1:22:35] the wood up the hill and offered offered
[1:22:37] up his own son amen so we could ask that
[1:22:40] question see he would ask did he do that
[1:22:41] did they say that and they would have
[1:22:43] been like yes he did that yes they said
[1:22:45] that because they were beginning to see
[1:22:48] that Jesus was so the word that he could
[1:22:51] go back and into the prophecies and say
[1:22:53] all these things have been fulfilled in
[1:22:55] my life amen and now we could come to
[1:22:58] you and I we could come to this age did
[1:23:00] he not say he'd send Malachi 4 in the
[1:23:02] later s Church age did he do that amen
[1:23:05] did he not say that that Ministry would
[1:23:06] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:23:08] the apostolic fathers has he done that
[1:23:10] amen did he not say Amen that that a
[1:23:13] people would know their God in this day
[1:23:15] do they know that did he not call you by
[1:23:17] his grace has he done that amen has he
[1:23:19] not washed you in his blood has not he
[1:23:21] done that has he filled you with the
[1:23:22] Holy Ghost has he done that amen has he
[1:23:25] not provided for you day after day after
[1:23:27] day has he done that has he not proved
[1:23:29] the power of his blood has he not done
[1:23:32] that for you amen has he not called you
[1:23:33] to his side has he not done has he not
[1:23:36] showed you you are his child you are his
[1:23:38] son or his daughter has he not proved
[1:23:40] himself in the storm well you say the
[1:23:42] storm's still raging well it doesn't
[1:23:43] mean he he can't handle that storm amen
[1:23:46] God is more than able amen has he opened
[1:23:49] the Seven Seals has he done that yes he
[1:23:51] has has the mighty angel ascended has he
[1:23:53] come down yes he has amen is he not
[1:23:55] Gathering his bride to himself in a
[1:23:57] Rapture as promised in the word
[1:24:00] hallelujah so you know it begin to it
[1:24:03] begin to Dawn upon them as they begin to
[1:24:06] soak it in seeing the fulfilling of all
[1:24:08] this and what had taken place the last
[1:24:09] few days in the last two or three years
[1:24:12] the Vindicated Prophecy of the age it
[1:24:14] was then that they knew that they
[1:24:15] crucified friend Jesus had fulfilled
[1:24:17] every word of this o if it was then that
[1:24:20] they know that that man truly was that
[1:24:22] Messiah that he should raise from the
[1:24:24] dead the grave couldn't hold him I'll
[1:24:25] not suffer my Holy One to seek
[1:24:27] corruption there's not one word of
[1:24:28] Prophecy can ever fail and he did raise
[1:24:33] amen amen he went to he went to the tomb
[1:24:36] with one promise that he had come out
[1:24:39] I'll not leave my soul Holy One I'll not
[1:24:42] leave thy soul in Hell neither suffer my
[1:24:45] Holy One to seek corruption Jesus went
[1:24:46] with that one promise to to Calvary that
[1:24:50] he knew he would come out again but the
[1:24:52] thing is because that was his
[1:24:54] identification it did not sway him can
[1:24:56] it happen or not he knew it was going to
[1:24:58] happen he said no man takes my life from
[1:25:00] me I lay it down if I lay it down I'll
[1:25:03] pick it back up again amen so he knew
[1:25:05] what he had to fulfill by Revelation now
[1:25:08] how much more you and I see we are God's
[1:25:10] attributes amen the redeemed son or
[1:25:13] daughter of God are God's attributes
[1:25:14] therefore we don't have to try and fit
[1:25:16] in with the world to be accepted our
[1:25:18] identification see you know people
[1:25:21] change how they do things based on who's
[1:25:23] around them yeah that's right I remember
[1:25:25] being at boarding school I started
[1:25:26] dressing like this rich guy in my dorm
[1:25:28] cuz I thought he was cool he didn't care
[1:25:29] a hell beans for me none right but I but
[1:25:32] because I was around these kind of
[1:25:34] people I tried to be like them to try
[1:25:35] and fit in because I thought well this
[1:25:37] is just where I am I'm in Pau house at
[1:25:39] Kings college and this is where I have
[1:25:41] to be this was my identification right
[1:25:43] but then when God comes your way you
[1:25:46] realize you don't have to change to
[1:25:49] please people you just let God change
[1:25:51] you to match his word because you're
[1:25:52] part of that word amen it's just like
[1:25:54] Mama Eagle you know you know the story
[1:25:56] of the you know baby eagle right she
[1:25:58] screamed to the baby that was in the
[1:26:00] chicken coop screaming to the mother I
[1:26:03] mean screaming to the baby because that
[1:26:05] cry was to awaken the baby to say You
[1:26:07] Belong With Me You Came From Me Now soar
[1:26:10] up to be with me you're not your your
[1:26:13] identification is not the chicken yard
[1:26:15] it's not the slop and the pen it's not
[1:26:17] these things it's not what the chickens
[1:26:19] are talking about you're built of a
[1:26:21] different material sure they were Birds
[1:26:23] a chicken and Eagle are birds they have
[1:26:25] the same kind of bone structure
[1:26:26] different things but they are different
[1:26:28] right one is built a sore on the
[1:26:30] heavenlies the other one is just food or
[1:26:32] the saw on the you be on the ground
[1:26:34] right but it wasn't the baby eagle that
[1:26:36] said now I'm a I'm an eagle no it was
[1:26:40] the Cry of Mama that gave baby its true
[1:26:44] identification and that's why this
[1:26:46] message is so important because it gives
[1:26:48] us our true identification that we are
[1:26:51] the sons and daughters of of God when
[1:26:53] you hear that voice behind the voice it
[1:26:55] becomes a supernatural call to you God
[1:26:57] is calling you to come up hither you may
[1:27:00] have been raised in a mess's church
[1:27:01] that's all perfectly fine but there's
[1:27:02] got to come a time when it becomes a
[1:27:05] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:27:07] you amen that you are part of him and
[1:27:10] you're going back to him and you belong
[1:27:12] to him and your identification is in his
[1:27:14] word amen that's why we can't do
[1:27:16] anything else that's why we can't change
[1:27:19] things and you know match the Modern
[1:27:21] Trend because we can't identify with
[1:27:23] that I can't identify with this world
[1:27:26] not because I have to try and make
[1:27:27] myself different but because God has
[1:27:29] reveal to me who I am I trust you feel
[1:27:32] the same way you can't go to the world
[1:27:34] because you don't belong to the world I
[1:27:37] mean you may have been raised in this
[1:27:38] world but this is not you know see it's
[1:27:41] just like with Pharaoh um just just like
[1:27:42] with Moses I think I had that scripture
[1:27:44] somewhere but it said by faith we had
[1:27:47] that in in Hebrews 11 this is what
[1:27:49] brother impo brought out said by faith
[1:27:52] see by faith Moses when he came to years
[1:27:54] refused to be called the son of
[1:27:56] Pharaoh's daughter so remember his
[1:27:58] mother would have because remember his
[1:27:59] mother was his witness right in the
[1:28:01] palace so she would have been whispering
[1:28:03] to him you're the deliverer you're the
[1:28:06] promised son you're more than another
[1:28:08] Hebrew boy you're a special child God
[1:28:11] answered our prayers you're here to
[1:28:13] fulfill prophecy you're here to be the
[1:28:15] God's going to use you to take us out of
[1:28:17] this place one day but you see the
[1:28:19] mother telling him wasn't enough God had
[1:28:21] to come by faith and reveal what his
[1:28:24] mother said was true about him and
[1:28:26] that's the same thing we can preach all
[1:28:28] the day long sing all the day long but
[1:28:30] takes the holy spirit of God to take
[1:28:31] that word and anchor into our hearts to
[1:28:33] reveal yes I am a Son of God I am a
[1:28:36] daughter of God I do belong to him and
[1:28:38] I'm going back to him amen so by faith
[1:28:41] he had a revelation one day when he came
[1:28:42] to years I don't belong here this is
[1:28:46] this is not the part of the word I meant
[1:28:47] to fulfill I'm not meant to be here with
[1:28:50] the Egyptians this is not who I truly am
[1:28:52] he did not work himself up to receive it
[1:28:55] God revealed it to him see it's not some
[1:28:57] mental gymnastics trying to work out who
[1:28:58] you are God tells you who you are and
[1:29:01] that's why we cannot have an inferior
[1:29:03] inferiority complex wondering how what
[1:29:05] people think about us we should know if
[1:29:07] God thought of me and redeemed me when
[1:29:10] he thought of me he didn't think
[1:29:11] anything negative of
[1:29:13] me like it says in Jeremiah thoughts
[1:29:15] towards you that of Peace you come to an
[1:29:17] expected end that expected end is is has
[1:29:19] be gathered around the throne Made In
[1:29:21] His Image that's how that's his expected
[1:29:23] end and God cannot change his thoughts
[1:29:25] about you and I amen if he thought about
[1:29:28] you that way that's it that's right sure
[1:29:31] we may go through correction and trials
[1:29:33] whatever on Earth but that's irrelevant
[1:29:35] that's all for our good but if God
[1:29:37] thought of you that way I have thoughts
[1:29:39] towards you of Peace not trouble not
[1:29:43] anxiety not worry not unstability you
[1:29:47] all these things not those things no of
[1:29:49] Peace but Lord don't you know we be in
[1:29:52] this kind of age he knew exactly the
[1:29:54] conditions of this world he knew exactly
[1:29:56] what would be going on but that did not
[1:29:57] change his mind amen about you
[1:30:01] Hallelujah I trust this is kind of
[1:30:03] anchoring in somewhere you know amen so
[1:30:06] by faith see he refused to be called the
[1:30:10] son of Pharaoh's daughter and by faith
[1:30:13] we're got to refuse to be identified I
[1:30:16] love this country y but I'm more than a
[1:30:19] New Zealander amen right I love this
[1:30:21] this is the best country I think it's
[1:30:23] one of the best countries in the world
[1:30:24] personally I've seen it just a few but
[1:30:27] you know I think this is a great country
[1:30:29] but my identity is not in New
[1:30:32] Zealand it's in the Lord and we have to
[1:30:35] go beyond our natural identity I came
[1:30:39] from this country this is my language
[1:30:40] this is my Forbe all those things are
[1:30:43] good but don't let that be your All In
[1:30:45] All Because if that's you're all in all
[1:30:47] you'll stay here right right but if the
[1:30:49] Lord reveals to you you are his child
[1:30:51] you're going going there amen and if he
[1:30:54] reveals that to you then the Lord will
[1:30:55] begin to change you that all of your
[1:30:58] everything you do will be his word am
[1:31:00] sure we have different cultures
[1:31:02] different ways that's fine God's a god
[1:31:03] of variety but you know everything we do
[1:31:06] should be according to the scripture
[1:31:09] amen amen amen amen let's just find a
[1:31:13] place to pull the bus
[1:31:17] over amen I'm so thankful we can say the
[1:31:20] Lord is our father
[1:31:24] amen you see maybe I just end with this
[1:31:27] thought Jacob could never become a
[1:31:30] prince with God by staying around
[1:31:33] Mama you'll find in the
[1:31:35] natural that especially a son needs
[1:31:38] validation from a father they need it
[1:31:42] those who have validation from their
[1:31:43] father become more stable people within
[1:31:45] themselves mother can say all they want
[1:31:48] and mothers you should pour it on to
[1:31:49] your children hey we should we should be
[1:31:51] you know you know we should speak
[1:31:52] positive about our kids you know brother
[1:31:53] Ram says we have the the best young
[1:31:56] people amen I'm glad someone agrees with
[1:32:00] me I think what's wrong with you
[1:32:04] parents we all have our traits and our
[1:32:07] things but he says you should never call
[1:32:09] them a bunch of rookies nothing negative
[1:32:11] so we have the most best young people in
[1:32:13] the world yes sir and I believe that I
[1:32:15] believe we should never think they are
[1:32:17] nothing they are they are wonderful
[1:32:19] you're wonderful young people it's like
[1:32:20] brother Marion I know he's not here but
[1:32:22] he invited me to go to the youth prayer
[1:32:23] meeting which he runs and I sat there I
[1:32:26] was just so blessed cuz years ago I said
[1:32:29] to them we wanted to see this kind of
[1:32:30] thing and here it is I said thank you
[1:32:34] for inviting me to your prayer meeting
[1:32:36] had a great time but you see but the
[1:32:38] thing
[1:32:39] is it takes a father to bring stability
[1:32:43] into a child see he could never become a
[1:32:46] prince with God by hanging around mama
[1:32:49] he had to he had to even though mother
[1:32:51] loved him and believed that he was going
[1:32:54] to be the one with the birthright right
[1:32:56] she had more Revelation than than than
[1:32:58] than um the father did right because
[1:33:02] because um Esau was loved by his father
[1:33:05] Jacob was loved by uh his uh uh their
[1:33:08] mother but you see he could not become a
[1:33:12] prince with God hanging around mama
[1:33:15] that's why God had to take him from
[1:33:16] there until finally he came to a place
[1:33:19] where he wrestled with God because
[1:33:21] before that his identity was in his
[1:33:24] first birth in his name of being a
[1:33:26] supplanter Jacob means a supplanter so
[1:33:29] he was living out that right and that's
[1:33:31] how people are sadly with their first
[1:33:34] nature and it can be their nationality
[1:33:37] it can be their family Spirit can be all
[1:33:38] different things they're just living
[1:33:40] that out but then there comes a time
[1:33:42] when they when we wrestle with God
[1:33:45] because he went from he went from a
[1:33:46] supplanter to Israel a prince with God
[1:33:49] Amen and his walk was different he had a
[1:33:52] limp amen so he went as a strong
[1:33:54] confident Shyer brother Braham calls him
[1:33:57] a supplanter but then he came out of
[1:34:00] that limping as a limping Prince with
[1:34:03] God but you see he wasn't Jacob anymore
[1:34:05] after that moment why because his
[1:34:08] identity was in the word of God sure he
[1:34:10] knew his forbears Abraham and Isaac now
[1:34:13] he's Jacob he knows that the promised
[1:34:15] son is going to come through all those
[1:34:16] things but it took God for him to
[1:34:19] wrestle with God that he had come to his
[1:34:22] position in the prophecy it's got to be
[1:34:24] the same thing with you and I friends
[1:34:26] we're got to wrestle with God until our
[1:34:28] walk is different our talk is different
[1:34:31] what we look at is different our dress
[1:34:33] is different our our motives our
[1:34:34] Ambitions all we are become his amen
[1:34:37] amen that doesn't matter what Trouble
[1:34:39] Comes our way we are Israel we're not a
[1:34:43] supplanter trying to work out things and
[1:34:44] Shady deals and manipulation to get
[1:34:46] their own ends no he went from that to a
[1:34:49] prince with God Amen because he realize
[1:34:52] this is who I really
[1:34:54] am and maybe we just have the musicians
[1:34:57] come
[1:34:58] now but I trust
[1:35:02] that when you look into the
[1:35:05] scripture when you look into the message
[1:35:07] you see your true
[1:35:09] identification amen that you are as as
[1:35:12] brother Isaac sung we'll sing it again I
[1:35:13] think now I have a father he calls me
[1:35:16] his own amen you know your
[1:35:19] identification is not in anything
[1:35:20] natural but it's in the word amen amen
[1:35:24] let's um let's stand this morning shall
[1:35:30] we amen let's sing that again shall we I
[1:35:34] have a maker before you ever in your
[1:35:37] mother's womb you're
[1:35:39] ordained amen you're ordained as the
[1:35:41] bride of Christ The True Believer is

[1:35:50] maker
