[8:01] bountiful supply for I'm dwelling in
[8:04] Beulah land you know who's flying in an

[8:44] victory that a Christian has is that he
[8:46] we can walk in that place you know and

[9:33] repentance that Lord there was a time
[9:36] where we weren't interested in the
[9:37] things of God and they even though it
[9:40] was the most valuable thing we could
[9:42] ever need or ever want or ever have and
[9:44] yet we had no desire for it Lord but it
[9:46] was your mercy Lord that showed us that
[9:49] we need you that we need a Savior Lord

[9:52] being something at us to respond we
[9:54] responded and we're just thankful for

[32:41] standing can we turn in our Bibles -
[32:45] Amen hallelujah - Sam 119 verse 105
[32:52] [Music]
[32:55] a men I was very nervous man so nervous
[33:00] my body was doing things that it doesn't
[33:02] know
[33:02] we do but you know you just yield to the
[33:06] Herman you know he makes all things good
[33:09] Alleluia amen he strengthens the weak
[33:12] and feeble and I will put my hand up
[33:15] there
[33:16] amen and I'm not coming in my strength I
[33:18] can tell you that for free hallelujah
[33:20] amen because my strengths will bring
[33:22] nothing but his strength brings life
[33:25] amen
[33:26] hallelujah so hundred and nineteen verse
[33:28] 104
[33:30] hallelujah before I read that I tell you
[33:32] the the the text as your new birth path
[33:37] revealed on eagle's wings amen your new
[33:41] birth path revealed on eagle's wings
[33:44] amen and I'll explain that in the sermon
[33:47] amen so let's just read here through thy
[33:51] precepts I get understanding
[33:54] therefore I hate every false way thy
[34:00] word is a lamp unto my feet hallelujah
[34:04] and a light unto my path
[34:07] amen is that your confession this night
[34:10] MA hallelujah Lord add your blessings to
[34:13] the reading of your word in Jesus name
[34:16] Amen
[34:17] you may be seated Alleluia and I'm just
[34:21] going to move fast through these
[34:21] readings because I just want to read a
[34:23] few things in quotes and scriptures to
[34:25] get the context and then we'll we'll see
[34:27] how the Lord leads in me so let's just
[34:29] go to some 1611 it says thou wilt show
[34:35] me thou will show me now we have to have
[34:40] our complete attention on the detailing
[34:43] of the scripture here thou Jesus Christ
[34:46] will show me the path of life there's a
[34:50] path of life and there's a path of death
[34:53] now there's only one path of life and
[34:56] that is the voice of God that will
[34:59] reveal the path of life amen so amen
[35:04] thou will show me the path of life in
[35:07] thy presence amen
[35:09] so he's this is connected now thou will
[35:12] show me the path of life in thy presence
[35:14] is the fullness of joy and
[35:16] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[35:18] forevermore amen so there is a reason
[35:22] why David you know under that
[35:23] inspiration he he says you will show me
[35:27] the path of life because without him
[35:28] without that's showing there is no life
[35:31] and and and but yet you for that to
[35:34] happen you need to be in his presence
[35:36] you need to get in his presence you need
[35:40] to live in as presence amen
[35:42] sometimes you will have hard times and
[35:44] you'll fail and you'll fall on the
[35:46] ground but get up and get back in his
[35:48] presence amen hallelujah make it right
[35:51] if you wrong someone go make it right
[35:53] don't wait it out and God is not a
[35:56] person that you need to wait till he
[35:58] cools down and then you make it right
[36:00] you can just make it right the moment
[36:01] that you failed Amen and get in his
[36:04] presence stay in his presence abide in
[36:07] his presence he that dwelleth in the
[36:09] secret place of the Most High shall rest
[36:12] amen not strive not get all worried and
[36:16] agitated and tossed to and fro but rest
[36:18] under the shadow of the Almighty Amen
[36:21] hallelujah
[36:23] so you see thou will show me the path of
[36:26] life so there is a path of life
[36:28] hallelujah and it is not an hour mind to
[36:31] know it hallelujah it is not an hour
[36:33] ability to figure it out there is no way
[36:37] that a human being can read the Bible in
[36:39] their own ability and find the path of
[36:41] life hallelujah because it's not a
[36:43] cookie cutter path there is a path for
[36:45] every individual amen every single one
[36:49] of us has a path of life and that path
[36:54] that path is going to lead you to your
[36:56] adoption that path is going to lead you
[36:59] to a rapture hallelujah that path is
[37:01] going to lead you to the fullness of the
[37:03] word and then the fullness of the word
[37:05] is going to take over your life and
[37:07] completely transform you prepare you and
[37:10] make you retro ready
[37:11] Alleluia not you but there is a path
[37:15] it's not our ability I won't show me the
[37:19] path of life a theologian won't show me
[37:21] the path of life the book of something
[37:24] else won't show me the path of life amen
[37:26] my intellectual ability to try and the
[37:30] the word won't show me the path of life
[37:32] me knowing every translation of the
[37:35] scripture ain't going to show me the
[37:36] path of life
[37:37] that's just my intellectual ability but
[37:39] I need to rely on the provision of the
[37:42] Lord I need to know what is God doing in
[37:45] my day because whatever he's doing is
[37:47] going to be for me it's going to affect
[37:50] me it's gonna be something for me it's
[37:52] going to be someone for me it's gonna be
[37:54] a ministry for me it's gonna be a pastor
[37:56] for me it's going to be something that
[37:58] God is doing and I need to find that out
[38:02] hallelujah amen it's sometimes it takes
[38:04] you know we get caught up in situations
[38:06] and everything like that and you get
[38:08] mowed down by all the crust on the
[38:10] eagle's head somehow you need to go to
[38:12] the rock amen and start scraping your
[38:15] head
[38:15] hallelujah so all of those thoughts and
[38:18] all of the stuff that overwhelming can
[38:19] just break off but only the rock can do
[38:22] it only the rock has the power
[38:24] amen to crack break off that crust
[38:27] hallelujah
[38:29] amen so we can heifer because there is
[38:33] an individual path amen
[38:35] hallelujah I'm so glad for that
[38:37] hallelujah okay you can rest
[38:39] amen you can rest even at the beginning
[38:42] of your walk with the Lord hallelujah
[38:45] the moment you start to catch a whiff
[38:47] you start to hear a voice
[38:49] Amen you start to hear something you
[38:51] start to catch something you know that
[38:52] something's going on that God is being
[38:55] raised out of history a man and there's
[38:57] something real happening a man and you
[38:59] start to catch that take rest
[39:01] amen let him lead you humble yourself
[39:06] humble yourself amen oh my amen praise
[39:12] the Lord Matthew 2 verse 10 and 11 says
[39:16] here these wise men were led to the
[39:19] fullness of the word by the light of the
[39:21] star amen
[39:22] a prophet said that these stars were
[39:25] following a birth path
[39:27] hallelujah so there's a path of a birth
[39:30] to lead people to the Messiah amen when
[39:36] they saw the star this as the wise men
[39:38] now when they saw the star they rejoiced
[39:40] with exceeding great joy and
[39:43] when they were coming to the house they
[39:45] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[39:47] and fell down and worshiped him and when
[39:52] they had opened their treasures they
[39:53] presented him gifts of gold frankincense
[39:55] and myrrh hallelujah you know these men
[40:03] would never have known where to go if it
[40:06] hadn't have been for a star that was
[40:09] guiding them and leading them and you
[40:12] see there was a purpose for that star in
[40:14] the sky and that star had a natural path
[40:15] of birth paths and these three stars
[40:17] come together amen and they and they
[40:20] come together and it was a and it was a
[40:23] sign in the heavens that something on
[40:25] the earth special was going on amen
[40:27] hallelujah amen and you know what we
[40:30] have had a star in the heavens and this
[40:33] generation Amen because the coming of
[40:36] the Lord
[40:38] imminently approaching amen hallelujah
[40:42] so the coming of the Lord immediately
[40:44] approaching what happens is you know up
[40:46] in the heavens there's a star that
[40:48] shines amen as the Sun comes around the
[40:51] earth there's a star that starts to
[40:52] reflect that light now that star doesn't
[40:55] give off its own light this is the
[40:57] morning star messenger that God sent to
[41:01] forerun the second coming amen
[41:03] a morning star messenger that God sent
[41:06] to forerun the second coming now he
[41:08] didn't give his own light off but he was
[41:11] a reflection you know let's just go
[41:13] natural here this star this morning star
[41:16] you know jesus promised the overcome of
[41:18] the morning star so it's not Satan if
[41:20] anyone even thinks that because he's
[41:22] just a phony morning star but the real
[41:24] morning star is Christ amen now so here
[41:28] we have Venus sitting in the sky and as
[41:31] the Sun comes around it reflects and
[41:34] just because the light you see the light
[41:36] is not quite enough in the earth at the
[41:39] time so you can see that morning star
[41:42] Venus reflecting the light of the Sun
[41:44] that's coming around the earth it's
[41:46] coming but you see as the as the coming
[41:49] of the Sun comes around that drowns out
[41:53] their light because the Sun is here
[41:56] and so we had a Morningstar messenger
[41:59] there is and I want to just speak about
[42:01] this not I'm gonna go through the whole
[42:04] sermon about the star but I just want to
[42:06] show you something that God declares
[42:08] these things in the heavens and the
[42:09] earth and nature and the Bible from
[42:11] Genesis to Revelation it's everywhere
[42:13] it's not just something that's been
[42:15] concocted up in some laboratory or some
[42:18] you know funny thing that's just done in
[42:21] darkness but he declared this over the
[42:23] whole earth in the universe and history
[42:26] in the future and everything this is the
[42:29] clear
[42:29] Amen now so you have the star that is
[42:34] pointing the way it is pointing to
[42:37] something it is pointing to someone and
[42:40] is declaring that there is light coming
[42:42] it is declaring the coming of the son
[42:45] amen
[42:46] and so here's a star and the people the
[42:48] wise people of this day can look up and
[42:52] see amen and they will continue to look
[42:57] up and see the stuff and they will see
[43:00] week because there's darkness all around
[43:02] right it's all dark and it's dawn you
[43:05] know dawn it's like not quite completely
[43:07] pitched but it's just a mental mediocre
[43:10] and yet you can still see that star in
[43:13] the sky there is a believer that hasn't
[43:15] entered the veil yet there is a believer
[43:18] that still you know they're on their
[43:19] journey they may have come out of Egypt
[43:21] they may be in the wilderness but
[43:23] they've got to go a little bit further
[43:24] and they look up and they can see the
[43:25] star in the sky and he say the Sun is
[43:29] coming there's going to be a day dawn
[43:31] where is that they going to be dawn I
[43:33] tell you it's going to dawn in your
[43:35] heart Alleluia and when that day dawn
[43:37] man this is the whole purpose of that
[43:41] morning messenger to come to declare a
[43:43] coming Sun so the Sun can come and you
[43:47] amen and when that happens you don't see
[43:50] no morning messenger no more you see him
[43:53] hallelujah you see the pillar of fire
[43:55] you see the king amen you see a second
[43:58] atom in your life hallelujah taking over
[44:01] because the light of the glory of the
[44:04] coming Sun lights everything so you
[44:06] don't see human males anymore you don't
[44:09] see this me
[44:10] and putting this man in front of the
[44:11] Smith you know see all of these things
[44:12] you see a king hallelujah let me read a
[44:15] scripture to Peter 1:19 2:20 says here
[44:19] we have also a more sure word of
[44:22] prophecy where until you do well a man
[44:25] who's thankful for a sure it word of
[44:26] prophecy that's evening
[44:27] hallelujah who's thankful for a message
[44:30] who's thankful that God wouldn't leave
[44:32] us in a denominational stupor fella
[44:35] Louie who's thankful that we can forsake
[44:37] our own thinking our own opinions their
[44:38] own traditions and everything and lay
[44:40] them all down her lujah who's thankful
[44:44] that they know what they should die to
[44:46] go before the king amen
[44:49] this is why he sends these things this
[44:52] is why he sent us this is love amen a
[44:55] sure word of prophecy where until you do
[44:59] well a man that you take heed hallelujah
[45:02] don't stir to the left or to the right
[45:04] the devils will try everything they can
[45:06] to get you
[45:07] they'll try everything they can young
[45:09] people hallelujah
[45:11] they'll try everything they can to pull
[45:13] you down oh my but you come and hit the
[45:16] sweet spot of that relationship you'll
[45:19] see these pleasures at his right hand
[45:20] forevermore amen there's nothing in this
[45:23] world compared hallelujah as unto a
[45:28] light that shine within a dark place
[45:30] Amen I can tell you there's a very dark
[45:32] place in humanity that's the human heart
[45:34] before the Son of God comes in amen
[45:37] it's a very bad place it's a place that
[45:41] people will go tossed to and fro they
[45:44] relying on religion they're relying on

[49:18] altar and your later life to a degree

[49:24] Jordan yet but you've you've recognized
[49:26] Calvary you recognize the Passover lamb
[49:29] you know and prieser you've been washed
[49:31] and these things going on your
[49:34] experience is increasingly you're in the
[49:35] you come across them seeing you come
[49:37] into the into the wilderness now your
[49:39] tests and the trials start in your life
[49:42] and you know as they start you know
[49:44] you're I liken this to the holy place
[49:46] this is the place where it's religious
[49:49] now and you know you're relying on the
[49:51] priests to bake the bread for you and
[49:54] and you eat that bread but the bread can
[49:56] go stale and sometimes you know to you
[49:58] it might not feel very good and you know
[50:01] you get this crust on your head if you
[50:02] don't get in the presence of God and the
[50:04] smoke you know sometimes the priests my
[50:06] the oil might go smoky you know and
[50:09] we've heard the preaching on this you
[50:11] know you're relying on priesthood now
[50:13] you're relying on other people for your
[50:16] experience but you know God is calling
[50:18] you further if you just look up Amen if
[50:21] you just get into his presence amen
[50:23] hallelujah and abide in him abide in him
[50:27] hallelujah oh my oh no all that crust
[50:31] all those thoughts you know you see you
[50:33] know it gets so busy when you're in the
[50:35] wilderness so hard sometimes because
[50:37] it's the whole purpose it's to purge you
[50:40] it's to cleanse you out amen to make you
[50:43] realize you can't do it amen it's to
[50:47] it's to expose the
[50:48] devil in your flesh and in that old
[50:50] nature that's trying to rule hallelujah
[50:53] you see but there's a purpose and if you
[50:57] get in the presence of God he will lead
[50:59] you to the kadish pioneer he will lead
[51:01] you up to the border he will lead you
[51:03] through the holy place past the
[51:06] showbread
[51:07] amen past the seven golden candlesticks
[51:09] in the light of the seven ages which is
[51:11] good and it's nice and there's good
[51:13] things in there amen
[51:14] but he wants to take you further he
[51:16] wants you to die amen
[51:18] he wants you to die on the altar of
[51:20] incense amen he wants an incense of your
[51:23] death they meant the death to your old
[51:25] nature
[51:26] hallelujah but if you don't if you fail
[51:29] to get in his presence while you're in
[51:32] this place and you live a natural
[51:33] Christian life and you just do things
[51:36] from day to day and you don't get into
[51:38] his presence and your prayer life is a
[51:40] ruin and your Bibles readings are ruined
[51:43] and you just sit in church and fall
[51:45] asleep 'ln and you know it's just not
[51:47] very entertaining for you you know this
[51:50] is not a good place to be because that's
[51:52] when the crust that's the form on your
[51:53] head hey man you don't want the crust on
[51:56] your head no no no crust because you see
[52:00] the crust forming on the head you know
[52:02] you can turn into some of these people
[52:04] that are fighting against Moses because
[52:07] they're not seeing the voice behind the
[52:09] voice they start getting caught up in
[52:10] the human politics get caught up and the
[52:13] things of man get caught up in the
[52:15] failures of man they want to watch Moses
[52:18] and see how he found here and did this
[52:20] here has a temper and maybe sort of
[52:22] fighting with his wife a few times and
[52:24] they thought wow this is not good you
[52:27] see because they and they saw everything
[52:29] so the miracle saw the glory of God they
[52:33] saw the great things
[52:34] amen but somehow their minds got blinded
[52:39] oh they might got blinded as my friend
[52:42] and it's not good
[52:44] hallelujah so it's so important but the
[52:47] people that got in the presence of God
[52:48] like Joshua and Caleb they kept a vision
[52:51] they kept faith and when they heard
[52:54] Moses speak they could hear the voice
[52:56] behind the voice they could hear the
[52:58] king speaking amen they could hear a
[53:01] spiritual voice
[53:02] these two things paralleling there is a
[53:05] message of william branham and his
[53:06] information and his teaching and his
[53:09] humanity and the effort that he made to
[53:12] bring for the message and then there is
[53:15] another paralleling power a power of
[53:18] prophecy fulfilling Scripture and that's
[53:22] the pillar of fire that's inside him
[53:24] that's the king of kings the judge of
[53:26] all the earth hallelujah coming down and
[53:29] leading a man to take a people further
[53:32] but people that don't get in his
[53:35] presence people that just live a natural
[53:37] Christian life they don't see these
[53:40] things and the devil starts to attack
[53:42] them and bring them down and they miss
[53:44] that they miss the voice behind the
[53:46] voice um but if you get in his presence
[53:50] hallelujah he will reveal your path to
[53:54] your new birth he will reveal your birth
[53:56] path your supernatural birth path
[53:59] because your natural birth past the
[54:01] stars that align naturally they made you
[54:04] they were your enemy the old nature is
[54:07] your enemy amen
[54:09] those personality traits and all that
[54:11] stuff but you see God has a specific
[54:14] path for you and it's going to undo all
[54:17] those things that wilderness experience
[54:19] is going to undo them all for you so
[54:22] that you can die on the altar Easter you
[54:29] see Esther seeking the King here's a
[54:31] picture of what's happening in our day
[54:33] here you have Esther now you have a king
[54:36] and he pulls and he wants a bride in the
[54:38] end time and the King pulls for a people
[54:41] for her first bride and she doesn't come
[54:42] so he does away with the denomination he
[54:46] does away with Pentecost he wants a
[54:48] bride it's nice this call for all the
[54:50] Virgin's of the land and the Virgin's
[54:52] come amen
[54:53] and all these people gather under a
[54:55] revival amen
[54:58] foolish and wise virgins and you see
[55:01] there was only one amen and I'm glad I'm
[55:05] part of that one amen
[55:07] you know what they will all be they all
[55:11] had the same Bible to read they had the
[55:14] same kings
[55:15] visions they had the same anointment
[55:18] sand same everything to use and they all
[55:23] started closing themselves and according
[55:26] to their own prophecy according to their
[55:29] own imagination they started to form a
[55:32] golden calf in the wilderness amen
[55:35] they started to form a golden calf of
[55:37] their own imagination they said this is
[55:39] the God that died on Calvary for me this
[55:41] is the God that took me over the Red Sea
[55:43] but it was their imagination and there's
[55:46] no way I'm telling you this there is no
[55:49] way to - to do it in your own strength
[55:53] God provided the Spirit of Moses the
[55:57] spirit of Joshua the same anointing the
[56:00] same ministries he provided because of a
[56:03] third Exodus that's happening in this
[56:04] thing there's a third Exodus where God
[56:06] is taking a bride out of a church and
[56:09] he's going to take her into the second
[56:11] Edom's Garden of Eden and you're going
[56:13] to live with him in a millennium Amy
[56:14] he's going to take you there hallelujah
[56:17] but you have to come under the prophetic
[56:19] power of the Prophet you cannot pass it
[56:23] yourself and you can see it perfectly
[56:25] clear in Esther because here is this
[56:27] Chamberlain amen and he knew the
[56:30] mysteries of the King he knew the heart
[56:31] of the king he knew what the King
[56:33] enjoyed he knew what he loved
[56:35] he knew how he wanted her to walk he
[56:37] knew how he wanted her to wear the
[56:39] clothing the anointing the oils amen
[56:43] the approach hallelujah the speak the
[56:46] speech he knew and he started to reveal
[56:50] it to her and you know what she knew now
[56:52] her birth path to Queen amen you catch
[56:55] them her birth path to Queen hello Queen

[1:02:06] bit close correctly out of Egypt in the
[1:02:09] wilderness but that's as far as they can
[1:02:10] go without the prophetic ministry of the
[1:02:13] seller they cannot cross over Jordan
[1:02:16] because you see the ministry that follow
[1:02:19] Joshua amen the fivefold ministry is
[1:02:22] anointed to take you across the door

[1:11:41] that's hybrid it cannot bring life the
[1:11:44] seed can only have another demon inside
[1:11:46] it that's why they go crazy when they
[1:11:48] leave this message that's why they do
[1:11:49] stupid things because there there's a
[1:11:52] hybrid sword in there and Satan gets
[1:11:53] inside that thought but if you've got
[1:11:55] God's thinking exciting can't get inside
[1:11:57] God you've got the word the word is pure
[1:12:00] if the word is pure do you know who
[1:12:02] spirits inside network amen God's Spirit
[1:12:06] is in that word that's true it's a true

[1:19:00] Laodicea man that puts the person that's
[1:19:04] there in Laodicea but we're in a bright
[1:19:08] age there is a in the soul your soul the
[1:19:11] revelation of the vision of heaven for
[1:19:15] you is above then it's open to
[1:19:17] revelation 4 of Christ leaning on his

[1:19:28] those little livings inside your mind
[1:19:30] that you hold on to will keep you in
[1:19:34] Laodicea they have to all be gone and
[1:19:39] then these things will start to make
[1:19:41] sense to you you'll see beyond the veil

[1:20:24] we will not we will not walk at path
[1:20:28] without being in his presence without
[1:20:30] having a relationship without leaning on
[1:20:32] its chest when you're leaning on his
[1:20:34] chest he's the one you're the one in
[1:20:36] whispers to you're the one he speaks to
[1:20:39] Judas in the room in the upper room you
[1:20:41] know the disciples all look to John
[1:20:44] because John was on his chest and they
[1:20:47] said John ask this is your place this is
[1:20:51] where you are think of this now his
[1:20:55] revelation for where John got caught up
[1:20:57] you see you are John right John would
[1:21:01] have got caught up in there and seen
[1:21:02] himself because there was the 24 elders
[1:21:04] there you know 12 of the Apostles he
[1:21:06] would have gone isn't John man he would
[1:21:08] have been excited there I am but you see
[1:21:10] put yourself there where else are you
[1:21:13] gonna go they're all complete this the
[1:21:15] twelve disciples of Paul replace Judas
[1:21:17] and there's the twelve Patriots and
[1:21:19] here's the king he says to him that
[1:21:21] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:21:24] on my throne where are you sitting
[1:21:25] together
[1:21:26] well them now hallelujah don't put that
[1:21:29] in the future yes there will be more
[1:21:31] fulfillment of it but there's a partial
[1:21:33] fulfillment now spiritually speaking
[1:21:35] you're seated together with them in
[1:21:38] heavenly places far above all
[1:21:40] principalities powers and rulers of
[1:21:42] darkness so when the enemy comes in like
[1:21:44] a flood hallelujah just remember the
[1:21:47] Redeemer has come to Zion the Redeemer
[1:21:50] has come to stay and he will raise a
[1:21:53] standard against every flood of the
[1:21:55] enemy you just need to speak and take
[1:21:58] you know just stand having done all the

[1:22:27] are united to Christ so there you see
[1:22:29] you can still be united you can still be

[1:22:55] is here the rock is here he rub your
[1:22:58] head on it you just pray to him ask him
[1:23:01] it's not something that you have to
[1:23:02] grovel it's not something you have to
[1:23:04] work up simple the power of God is in
[1:23:07] this room to rub your head against amen
[1:23:11] so just get the crust off the eagle you
[1:23:13] know who knows the story of the bald
[1:23:14] eagle they get crusts on their head and
[1:23:17] they have to go up to the rock and they
[1:23:19] rub it off amen and that renews their
[1:23:22] youth amen hallelujah that's exactly
[1:23:26] what needs to happen sometimes to an
[1:23:27] eagle they get a bit of crust on me and
[1:23:29] they've been living too naturally now
[1:23:32] naturalizing everything and it's time to
[1:23:35] get into his presence and that crust
[1:23:38] come off hello Louie yeah you don't have
[1:23:41] to earn it now you just have to pray ask
[1:23:43] him just lay it all down Lord is
[1:23:46] anything in my life that is stopping
[1:23:49] this there anything in me that I need to
[1:23:52] surrender for Lord I'm going to look to
[1:23:55] the star that you reflected yourself on
[1:23:57] I'm gonna read this message I'm gonna
[1:23:59] listen I'm gonna listen with all my
[1:24:01] heart I'm gonna lay everything aside
[1:24:03] until I hear that voice bar in a voice
[1:24:05] that reveals the path to my new birth
[1:24:08] that shows me like Esther how what to
[1:24:11] lay down because you see the others they
[1:24:14] died to what they thought they should
[1:24:15] right
[1:24:16] they died - all sorts of things they
[1:24:18] didn't they probably you know they these
[1:24:20] are the were virgins in the harem they
[1:24:22] would have laid down this and laid down
[1:24:23] there and laid down these things that
[1:24:25] they used to be to try a new identity in
[1:24:28] their mind they thought this is probably
[1:24:30] what the King likes and I'm talking
[1:24:32] details now I'm not you know there are
[1:24:35] people you know when I'm talking about
[1:24:36] my new details to us but to God their
[1:24:39] major to the king they made all the
[1:24:42] difference because you see that
[1:24:44] messenger that if it's the head that
[1:24:47] message that she came under clothed her
[1:24:50] in the heart of the king when the King
[1:24:54] saw Esther he saw a reflection of
[1:24:56] himself a man he saw himself when he
[1:24:59] fell in love hallelujah amen
[1:25:03] because she clothed herself she humbled
[1:25:06] herself she didn't get all angry when
[1:25:08] the Minister Minister person bettan it
[1:25:09] they will she wasn't carnal when he said
[1:25:12] things that were challenging to her she
[1:25:13] said okay because she you know and
[1:25:16] tightener in the spirit she was in the
[1:25:19] spirit of the moment she was in the
[1:25:21] spirit of the vision hallelujah there
[1:25:23] was a faith inside her that said this
[1:25:25] man has the truth hallelujah and if I
[1:25:28] just listen hallelujah all these others
[1:25:31] trying their best and they might get
[1:25:34] very close but still every way a man we
[1:25:40] have a more sure word of prophecy and
[1:25:42] you mix the all that together and you're
[1:25:44] gonna get a date on a man in your heart
[1:25:46] because you know what your you will be
[1:25:49] it will be revealed to you now you might
[1:25:51] just be carnal and you hear the message
[1:25:53] and it's just another message and the
[1:25:54] dibbles telling you oh look you've got
[1:25:56] that wrong and that wrong and everything
[1:25:57] like that but if you get in the spirit
[1:26:00] and God starts to reveal to you you'll
[1:26:02] hear a voice behind the voice and it
[1:26:04] will build a more sure word of prophecy
[1:26:06] in your life amen hallelujah in the
[1:26:10] Daystar will rise in your heart amen
[1:26:13] amen amen
[1:26:15] everything that you thought you were
[1:26:18] will be completely changed hey man
[1:26:22] because this is what he does he comes
[1:26:24] into a heart that is full of destruction
[1:26:26] he doesn't come into a nice place
[1:26:29] look at all the pictures in the Bible
[1:26:30] look at the time when they came over
[1:26:32] Jordan and come into a nice place the
[1:26:34] captain with the sword in his hand and
[1:26:36] come down to Paradise amen
[1:26:38] he came down to war amen when Jesus
[1:26:42] comes again when the earth gets her
[1:26:44] baptism the earth itself now talking
[1:26:47] about the whole earth she gets a baptism
[1:26:49] of Holy Ghost I mean Jesus himself and
[1:26:52] we're with him
[1:26:53] comes down to Jerusalem he doesn't come
[1:26:56] into a nice Jerusalem full of happy
[1:26:58] people he comes into a place that has
[1:27:00] all sit to destroy him and you and me
[1:27:05] whole world against and there's atomic
[1:27:09] warfare there's everything that people
[1:27:11] can possibly do whatever advancement of
[1:27:13] weaponry everything that's going to be
[1:27:16] against us and he just speaks the word
[1:27:19] god and it probably be something real
[1:27:22] silly hey man just to rub it in his face
[1:27:24] hallelujah like it was for Array him you
[1:27:27] know it was a it was silly no I don't
[1:27:30] mean that in a bad way but it wasn't
[1:27:32] like what men would think his men
[1:27:34] thought it was foolish but God thought
[1:27:36] it was great amen and the spiritual man
[1:27:39] thinks that's great
[1:27:40] hallelujah no one would have come up
[1:27:42] with that idea let's march around the
[1:27:45] walls mn and shout and humiliation these
[1:27:48] people probably laughing down the walls
[1:27:50] look at these people but they're
[1:27:52] probably scared at the same time amen
[1:27:53] hallelujah amen you see it's different
[1:27:57] that's gonna be like that and it's like
[1:27:59] that in your life you can't figure it
[1:28:01] all out don't try you just get in his
[1:28:04] presence say man I think that's been the
[1:28:06] thing right that's your privilege get in
[1:28:10] his presence stay in his presence and if
[1:28:14] you fall out of something and have a bit
[1:28:16] of a failure just go straight back and
[1:28:19] enjoy your ten minutes if that's all you
[1:28:21] can give for now
[1:28:22] just give them ten minutes don't strive
[1:28:26] and thank him man I've only got I'm only
[1:28:28] giving him ten minutes of my day and I'm
[1:28:30] not saying that you should just give him
[1:28:31] ten minutes I think you should give him
[1:28:33] more I won't think I always you know but
[1:28:36] it's not a time limit it's not time
[1:28:38] pressure but the main thing is that you
[1:28:40] enjoy it
[1:28:41] enjoy it if you don't enjoy it it's not
[1:28:45] even point doing it because you're not
[1:28:47] even entering and you're just having
[1:28:48] this duty my duty I've got to pray for
[1:28:51] this person and pray for Aunt Sally and
[1:28:52] pray for Grandma no that's not it it's
[1:28:56] more than that
[1:28:57] enjoy your prayer life enjoy your
[1:29:02] relationship enjoy the sermon don't
[1:29:05] strive if you're not getting everything
[1:29:07] just enjoy what God speaks to you get
[1:29:10] into a state of mind where you can
[1:29:12] actually enjoy and just say Lord speak
[1:29:14] to me I'm not going to try and learn
[1:29:16] everything we don't need to try and
[1:29:18] learn everything and try and know all
[1:29:20] knowledge because it can pop up if it's
[1:29:23] just knowledge but if you sit in a state
[1:29:25] of expectation and you're just resting
[1:29:28] and eating with them amen hallelujah and
[1:29:30] just let him speak to you and say Lord
[1:29:33] what do you have for me today hallelujah
[1:29:36] just go into that rest
[1:29:37] into that place your prayer life will
[1:29:39] become more enjoyable amen
[1:29:41] your prayer life will be better amen
[1:29:44] it's not a duty
[1:29:46] it's a privilege it's an honor that's
[1:29:48] the most enjoyable part of our life it's
[1:29:51] communion with the king
[1:29:52] but you see a lot of personalities and
[1:29:56] mine included wants to have a
[1:29:58] performance-based relationship you know
[1:30:00] and you've got to do a certain amount
[1:30:01] and if you don't you get frustrated well
[1:30:03] I don't do that anymore thankfully God
[1:30:04] showed me so much about those things but
[1:30:06] now it's just like you know if I only
[1:30:09] have a little bit of time I'm going to
[1:30:11] not get pressured and try and do
[1:30:13] everything I want to get in his presence
[1:30:16] I want to hear from him amen
[1:30:18] this is the key the key to wherever
[1:30:21] you're at right now get in his presence
[1:30:23] amen get in his presence hallelujah amen

[1:30:34] he wants you more than you want him he
[1:30:38] wants to be in your with you he's he
[1:30:41] sent angels and messages and prophets
[1:30:44] and everything for thousands of years
[1:30:46] hallelujah he said all the human race
[1:30:49] all that's been out of his Bible after
[1:30:52] all these prophecies
[1:30:54] she loves you to show you what he wants
[1:30:56] to do for you right now
[1:30:59] a man is pointed at all at you you are
[1:31:04] the star of his show a man hallelujah
[1:31:07] amen oh my wait you know when we
[1:31:10] recognize these things you know just all
[1:31:13] this other stuff and duty and striving
[1:31:15] and and and all that just starts to fade
[1:31:20] into the glory of that love that was
[1:31:23] expressed when he for the joy that was
[1:31:26] set before him you know he was thinking
[1:31:28] he loves you he did that for you you
[1:31:32] know Louie amen hallelujah amen
[1:31:39] sorry I'll read this now and then we're
[1:31:41] close a church across the nation we're
[1:31:48] following Jesus Christ the word to be in
[1:31:51] the bride you have to be remarried to
[1:31:53] the Word of God which is Christ in the
[1:31:56] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:31:58] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:32:01] was made flesh and dwelt among us as
[1:32:03] long as you hold to men's tradition of
[1:32:06] denominations you could be walking in
[1:32:09] this message and still holding to
[1:32:10] traditional thinking and if you are you
[1:32:13] will never go further then until you get
[1:32:20] rid of all of that stuff and lay it all
[1:32:22] down because it's just tree of knowledge
[1:32:24] and some of it may be right but you just
[1:32:27] got to be willing to lay it all down
[1:32:29] because God needs to rebuild the image
[1:32:32] in your mind
[1:32:33] he needs to rebuild and reveal the image
[1:32:35] in his season not your season not you
[1:32:39] striving and comparing all the quotes
[1:32:41] and scriptures or together yes it's nice
[1:32:42] to do those things as well but it's not
[1:32:44] just it's not you learning it's God
[1:32:48] teaching that's God leading he has a
[1:32:52] path and he wants to reveal it to units
[1:32:55] and that he will reveal the paths of
[1:32:58] life and the presence of the Lord is the
[1:33:01] fullness of joy in his presence the path
[1:33:05] will be revealed to you your path
[1:33:08] amen no matter where you're in as long
[1:33:14] as you hold to man's tradition of
[1:33:16] denominations you are called in God's
[1:33:18] Word an adulteress as long as you're a
[1:33:21] denominational Creed seeker belonging to
[1:33:24] a denominational Church that denies the
[1:33:26] word you are an adulteress what the
[1:33:28] Bible said Jesus said you cannot serve
[1:33:30] two gods at the same time you either
[1:33:32] serve God or Mammon Mammon is the world
[1:33:35] he that loves the world or the things of
[1:33:38] the world the love of God is not even in
[1:33:40] him that is one of the most serious in
[1:33:43] severe scriptures of the Bible you know
[1:33:45] it really is if we if we're sincere and
[1:33:48] we really look at that we should really
[1:33:50] look at that this is something to really
[1:33:53] look at the word and see your reflection
[1:33:55] do you love the things of this world you
[1:34:00] know the love of God is Jesus Christ the
[1:34:06] love of God is the passion of Christ to
[1:34:09] have you it says love revealed to you
[1:34:12] perfect love casts out all fear you how
[1:34:16] I don't ask you this question in a
[1:34:18] practical manner how could how could you
[1:34:22] have the very second atom in your heart
[1:34:25] and an eat dinner condition and actually
[1:34:27] even how could there be any room for any
[1:34:29] other love how could be be if your whole
[1:34:32] life is completely saturated by an idiot
[1:34:36] condition and Christ is in the heart
[1:34:38] there's neither room you think of that
[1:34:41] his love so strong so measureless and
[1:34:45] strong or my love that took him tortured
[1:34:49] hair pulled out you know blood falling
[1:34:52] on the hanging on the cross I loved so
[1:34:54] mighty so great and so holy how could
[1:34:59] any other love be in there the seed of
[1:35:04] God can't be in him the same time the
[1:35:07] love of God the love of the world is in
[1:35:09] there when the seed of God is operating
[1:35:11] through you that's the Word of God the
[1:35:14] love of the world can't be in there at
