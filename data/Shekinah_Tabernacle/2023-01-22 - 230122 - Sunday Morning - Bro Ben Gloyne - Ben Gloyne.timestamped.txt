[18:48] [Music]
[19:04] me
[19:37] this um
[19:38] song just came to me yesterday
[19:40] and
[19:41] mostly the inspiration is from romans 10
[19:45] and
[19:46] basically paul is just talking about the
[19:48] gospel of peace you know
[19:50] and the good tidings that they bring and
[19:53] and to be able to see that those that
[19:55] call on the name of the lord shall be
[19:56] saved and i was so blessed with that
[19:58] because he's just referring to so many
[20:01] different scriptures and
[20:03] you know the book of job talks about it
[20:04] and then peter says in x is not this
[20:07] this is that which was spoken of the
[20:08] book of joel and here we are again you
[20:10] know the second time so praise the lord
[20:13] and and i just thought of the power of
[20:14] praises you know that even those that
[20:16] were locked up like paul and silas there
[20:18] they could just praise the lord and set
[20:20] the captives free so this is kind of
[20:22] like the inspiration
[20:26] and thank you to the band sorry i only
[20:27] just sent it yesterday

[41:42] we're living in a tremendous hour
[41:45] we don't want to let this hour pass us
[41:47] by
[41:50] i feel like we're
[41:51] like blind bartimaeus
[41:53] jesus is walking past he's never going
[41:55] to walk past that way again
[41:57] that's his moment he took that moment
[42:00] he wasn't blind by the mouse no more
[42:01] after that moment
[42:03] just let us be the same this morning
[42:06] amen this is prophecy ezekiel speaking
[42:08] of our day
[42:09] he says for i'll take you from among the
[42:11] heathen and gather you out of all
[42:13] countries and bring you into your own
[42:15] land so i'll take you from methodist
[42:17] presbyterian baptist catholic agnostic
[42:20] atheist new age buddhist hindu whatever
[42:23] i'll bring you out of those nations amen
[42:25] and bring you into your own land what is
[42:26] the land that's the land of the word of
[42:28] god
[42:29] amen then i'll sprinkle clean water upon
[42:31] you and you shall be clean
[42:33] from all your filthiness and from all
[42:35] your idols will i cleanse you
[42:38] amen and god doesn't leave a spot he
[42:40] cleanses 100 percent
[42:42] amen a new heart also all i give you and
[42:45] a new spirit will i put within you and i
[42:48] will take away the stony heart out of
[42:50] your flesh and i'll give you and heart
[42:52] of flesh now notice the process here and
[42:54] i'll put my spirit within you and cause
[42:56] you to walk in my statutes and you shall
[42:59] be and you shall keep my judgments and
[43:01] do them and you shall dwell in the land
[43:04] that i gave to your fathers what's that
[43:06] amen the book of acts pentecostal
[43:08] original apostolic fathers amen of the
[43:11] word of god and you shall be my people
[43:13] and i will be your god
[43:16] hallelujah then we're going to go to
[43:18] daniel 11 and verse 32 and this this has
[43:20] been on the
[43:22] on the board a few times here before
[43:25] service and i just love the i just love
[43:27] this verse this is so to me
[43:30] god's speaking about us
[43:33] here in daniel 11 32
[43:37] the b part not the a apart
[43:40] that's the devil's role i'm not playing
[43:42] his role
[43:43] i haven't signed up to do his role i'm
[43:45] here to do the believer's role god
[43:47] called me to that role
[43:49] amen i trust that he's called you to
[43:51] that role not to what the devil's doing
[43:54] i'm not on his side i've got nothing to
[43:55] do with him he has no part of me i have
[43:57] no pardon him
[43:58] amen says and such as do wickedly
[44:01] against the covenant shall he corrupt by
[44:03] flat
[44:04] flatteries by the people that know their
[44:06] god shall be strong
[44:09] and do exploits i mean so what is that
[44:12] after he has put his spirit within you
[44:14] and causes you to keep his statues and
[44:16] his judgment but the people that know
[44:17] their god
[44:18] shall be strong
[44:20] let the weak say i am strong amen if you
[44:23] know your god if you know the lord jesus
[44:25] you are strong you are not weak you are
[44:27] strong
[44:28] hallelujah amen so

[45:34] be part of a church but we're here to
[45:36] feed off your word the body word of the
[45:38] son of man so may you feed us oh god and
[45:41] change us forever lord in jesus christ's
[45:43] name amen
[45:45] amen god bless you friends you may have
[45:47] your seats this morning
[45:48] so i i'm not going to get into it today
[45:51] but you know we live in a very very
[45:53] amazing hour
[45:54] you know it's incredible i i pray we
[45:56] really pinch our spiritual conscience
[45:59] in this season
[46:01] you know the bible prophesies of three
[46:03] woes or three world wars
[46:05] this is the book of revelation we know
[46:07] that the first two have already passed
[46:09] and the third one's coming
[46:11] that third one's going to be in the
[46:12] great tribulation i don't want to be
[46:14] here for that third one
[46:15] brother brown was told in 1933 when he
[46:18] saw seven major visions and and and when
[46:20] he was speaking of what what would
[46:21] happen with russia the lord told them
[46:23] watch russia watch the king of the north
[46:25] didn't say watch the soviet union watch
[46:27] russia and we know russia is on on its
[46:29] move and to me it's incredible if you
[46:31] look at world events right now where
[46:33] they're they're poised to invade the
[46:34] ukraine
[46:35] and it's amazing because when you look
[46:37] at the uh history before world war ii
[46:40] you know you know started there you know
[46:42] the germans they they begin to retake
[46:45] parts of europe that were german
[46:46] speaking predominantly german speaking
[46:49] then they invaded poland then it really
[46:50] blew up but you know and and it's
[46:52] amazing with the russians here in
[46:53] ukraine now this is me but i see history
[46:55] repeating itself because the ukraine
[46:58] it's not just that it was part of the
[46:59] soviet union they want it back but
[47:01] culturally the ukraine is where russia
[47:03] was birthed
[47:05] so and then there's a lot of russian
[47:07] speaking people in that part of the
[47:08] world so they want it back because it
[47:10] was part of russia and culturally that's
[47:12] where russia is actually from and what
[47:14] we call the ukraine today so i things
[47:16] are poised
[47:18] you know the last major vision he had
[47:19] was was that america was smoke bombs and
[47:22] craters
[47:23] and you see everything that's happening
[47:24] in the news from when george floyd was
[47:26] brutally murdered there some years back
[47:28] in the riots and everything that's been
[47:30] going on in the and the storming of the
[47:32] cattle yeah you know washington all
[47:33] those different things that stepping
[47:35] stones for the destruction of america
[47:38] right and we're going to get it too
[47:40] so we don't want to be caught here when
[47:42] that happens the lord has given us a way
[47:44] of escape which is the rapture right so
[47:47] we don't but then the thing is we don't
[47:49] know how much of it will taste before we
[47:51] go
[47:53] right so i trust that when all is said
[47:55] and done your relationship is not with
[47:57] this church
[47:59] it's not with me it's your life is built
[48:02] upon the word of god
[48:04] that if there's no believers around you
[48:06] you're somewhere far i don't know where
[48:09] no church to go to no sermons to hear no
[48:11] songs to listen to your life is so built
[48:13] upon the word that you are a living
[48:16] bible amen that you don't even need this
[48:18] no more you don't need a message book
[48:20] because it's in you living
[48:22] this is the kind of thing i want to talk
[48:24] about spiritual prepping
[48:27] we ain't physical prepping because i'm
[48:29] not here to see a tribute i'm not
[48:30] anointed to go into a tribulation i'm
[48:32] anointed to take a rapture that's why
[48:34] this message came in this end time that
[48:36] we would be taken out amen before the
[48:39] great tribulation sets in but there will
[48:41] be pre-tribulation time and we're seeing
[48:43] it on the earth
[48:44] let's pinch our spiritual consciences
[48:47] right because the devil wants us to
[48:49] float by get caught up in the busyness
[48:50] of life just watch the world go by
[48:52] because he wants us to be dragged in
[48:54] there but the lord is determined we're
[48:56] not going to be dragged into that we're
[48:58] going to go up
[48:59] but it depends yes what you want
[49:03] your decision i'm predicting if you're
[49:05] predicting you'll push in with all your
[49:07] with everything within you like brother
[49:08] ahmad preached a masterpiece on
[49:10] wednesday he's just getting better all
[49:11] the time god bless you for that amen but
[49:15] caleb was pre-destined to take that
[49:17] mountain
[49:18] that was the burden of his whole life
[49:20] give me my mountain i'm going to live
[49:22] here
[49:23] maybe might take me 44 years you know
[49:25] from from from kate spanier until i get
[49:27] here but i'm going to get here and he
[49:29] got there because he was determined i've
[49:31] tasted the land i've been on the land
[49:33] it's a good land it's my land
[49:35] amen so we should be the same kind of
[49:37] way
[49:38] this every divine promise is ours it's
[49:40] mine right now
[49:42] not it's not because we count ourselves
[49:44] worthy but because he gives it
[49:46] amen
[49:48] hallelujah now if we go to exodus we're
[49:50] just going to do a bit of a um
[49:52] uh
[49:53] sunday school reading
[49:55] here but as i said about this this this
[49:58] prophecy here in ezekiel he was talking
[50:00] about the believers i believe especially
[50:03] in this time but also in the new
[50:05] testament time right there's a prophecy
[50:07] this is what god is going to do to them
[50:09] amen so that they're not just going to
[50:11] say they're not just going to have a
[50:12] dry-out confession with no birth they're
[50:14] not just going to say i believe the
[50:16] message with no change they're not going
[50:18] to say i'm a believer without any power
[50:19] of god to manifest the word that they
[50:21] believe that's not what god's purpose is
[50:24] god's purpose is to fill you with his
[50:25] goodness filling with his being fill you
[50:28] with his word that he lives out of you
[50:29] and shakes the world
[50:31] amen this world needs a shaking it's
[50:33] right now
[50:37] if you want to call me a fanatic sure
[50:38] label me that way
[50:40] if that will reason away conviction but
[50:42] don't reason away conviction get in
[50:44] while you can
[50:47] so exodus chapter 12 verse 5 if you want
[50:49] to say hannah we're probably going to
[50:51] make you work today
[50:52] but she's awesome in the back because
[50:54] you don't realize what's going on
[50:55] because it just goes up there there's no
[50:56] sore necks turning around wondering
[50:57] what's going on unfortunately that's the
[50:59] only time you notice when you're in the
[51:01] you know when things don't go anyway
[51:03] exodus 12 and 5.
[51:05] now notice your lamb so this is the
[51:07] first exodus they had to prepare to
[51:09] leave
[51:10] even though the lord had come to take
[51:11] them out they had to pro they had to
[51:13] they had to apply the blood
[51:16] and your lamb shall be without blemish
[51:17] now we know we have the perfect lamb
[51:20] that's why i love when i fall i know i
[51:21] have a perfect lamb
[51:23] amen i have the perfect lamb the lord
[51:25] jesus christ and it's the lamb that
[51:27] matters
[51:28] it's not your condition it's his
[51:29] condition that mattered and because the
[51:31] lamb is accepted i'm accepted
[51:34] right because his sacrifice was accepted
[51:36] i'm accepted a male of the first year ye
[51:38] shall take from from the sheep or from
[51:40] the goats and you shall keep it up until
[51:42] the 14th day of the same month and the
[51:44] whole assembly of the congregation of
[51:46] israel shall kill it in the evening
[51:48] and
[51:49] they shall take the blood and strike it
[51:51] notice now on the door on the two side
[51:53] posts and on the upper door post of the
[51:55] houses ruined you shall eat it so it had
[51:58] to be applied in three places it wasn't
[52:00] just enough to apply it on the top
[52:02] lentil or one side post or both side
[52:04] posts and no lentil it had to be applied
[52:06] in three places so the blood has to be
[52:08] applied on your body your spirit and
[52:10] your soul right it's not just enough to
[52:12] cleanse you from bad habits not just
[52:14] enough to make you a good person amen
[52:16] not just enough to make you speak in
[52:18] tongues run around and shout be anointed
[52:20] but that the the blood must be applied
[52:22] the holy ghost must be applied on your
[52:24] spirit your soul and your body all three
[52:27] places now
[52:28] i trust when we're going through this
[52:30] you can just shout and rejoice saying
[52:32] god's done this to me already
[52:34] right irrespective of how you feel but i
[52:36] trust you know because
[52:38] my heart i was praying in the back there
[52:40] i said lord when the rapture goes may no
[52:42] one be here
[52:44] may this place be empty from the oldest
[52:46] to the youngest might just be totally
[52:48] empty because we all have gone may none
[52:50] of us be missing that day
[52:53] amen so we want to be ready
[52:57] right so the blood must be applied on
[52:58] three places now if we go to first john
[53:01] so he's going to go quickly through
[53:03] these but i wanted to get that point
[53:04] remember
[53:05] body spirit soul
[53:07] on all three the blood had to be applied
[53:10] amen for the death angel to pass over
[53:11] now in first john 5
[53:14] it says here verse 5 and
[53:17] i'm sorry
[53:18] first john chapter 5 verse 6 and we're
[53:20] going to read down to 9.
[53:22] this is he that came by water and blood
[53:25] even jesus christ not by water only
[53:28] but by water and blood and it is the
[53:31] spirit that beareth witness because the
[53:33] spirit is truth
[53:35] for there are three that bear record in
[53:37] heaven
[53:38] the father the word and the holy ghost
[53:40] and these three are one notice these
[53:42] three are one
[53:44] and there are three that bear witness in
[53:46] earth
[53:47] the spirit and the water and the blood
[53:49] and these three agree in one
[53:52] so in verse seven it says they are one
[53:54] but in verse eight the water
[53:57] the blood and the spirit these three a
[53:59] green one so you need all three of those
[54:01] components in the christian life to have
[54:03] a real new birth
[54:05] right so it's like a natural baby being
[54:07] born first the waters break and then
[54:10] there's blood the baby's birth but then
[54:12] the life has to come into the baby she's
[54:14] got to start crying or he's going to
[54:15] start crying the spirit's got to come in
[54:18] so it takes the water the blood and the
[54:20] spirit to and all those ingredients make
[54:23] the new birth now notice it's god that
[54:25] does all three
[54:27] but we don't want to stop with just
[54:28] being justified by faith i mean we're
[54:30] justified by faith by believing on the
[54:32] lord jesus christ we have to believe it
[54:34] right
[54:35] and then we can't just stop from being
[54:37] justified then going on to
[54:38] sanctification where the blood
[54:39] sanctifies us
[54:41] right and we're cleansed from all you
[54:42] know
[54:44] evil ways of you know you know talking
[54:45] and acting and things we do and you know
[54:48] you know filthy habits of the world
[54:50] we can't just stop there and be
[54:51] sanctified
[54:53] but we need him to come in and step into
[54:55] our lives and be the christian in us
[54:57] right so this is this is what we need so
[54:59] there's three ingredients to the new
[55:01] birth just like i was saying there in
[55:03] exodus the blood had to be applied in
[55:04] three places couldn't just stop in one
[55:06] place it had to go everywhere
[55:08] amen so now we can't just be justified
[55:13] or sanctified and not filled with the
[55:15] holy ghost
[55:17] but those three things are all definite
[55:18] works of grace
[55:20] amen so it's god so don't throw away
[55:23] what god has done
[55:24] you know it's like you know you're the
[55:26] israelites when they cross jordan they
[55:28] didn't despise what god did for them in
[55:29] egypt they didn't despise what god did
[55:31] for him at the red sea they despise what
[55:33] good got what god did for them in sinai
[55:36] right they rejoice in those things but
[55:37] they walk god had brought them further
[55:39] they didn't discount so if god was
[55:41] dealing in your life or in your when
[55:43] you're in the world you just thought i
[55:44] just got to find god or find a church
[55:46] somewhere and god brought you that's god
[55:48] working because god calls us to himself
[55:51] i remember then we need to send it to
[55:52] his call to his word and give ourselves
[55:55] to him
[55:56] amen now if we go back into the book of
[55:58] acts now because we live in a book of
[56:00] acts era don't we
[56:02] i mean so if we go to acts 19 and verse
[56:04] one i was going to read a couple of
[56:06] instances here where people were
[56:08] preaching that jesus was the christ amen
[56:11] but they hadn't received the holy ghost
[56:12] yet
[56:13] this is the biggest danger
[56:16] and you say this is this is out there no
[56:18] no this is here
[56:20] right
[56:21] now acts 19 and 1
[56:24] and it came to pass that while apollos
[56:25] was at corinth paul having passed um
[56:27] having passing through the upper coast
[56:29] came to ephesus and finding certain
[56:31] disciples and he said unto them have you
[56:34] received the holy ghost since you
[56:36] believed this is a fundamental question
[56:38] that really we should ask one another
[56:40] because it's not when you believe you
[56:42] receive the holy ghost no since you
[56:43] believed have you received him right
[56:45] have you received and i love it how the
[56:47] apostle paul just just comes down to the
[56:49] crunch have you been born again have you
[56:51] met the god amen the resurrected lord
[56:53] jesus does he live in your life amen
[56:56] have you received the holy ghost since
[56:57] you believed and they said unto him we
[57:00] have not so much as heard will there be
[57:01] any holy ghost we don't know really what
[57:03] you're talking about it's a foreign
[57:05] concept to us
[57:06] i mean all we know is the baptism of
[57:08] john and different things but you know
[57:10] but god moves on because god fulfills
[57:13] his word
[57:14] amen and he said unto them unto what
[57:16] then were you baptized and they said
[57:18] unto john's baptism now you think here's
[57:21] the man that baptized jesus he is the
[57:23] forerunner to the messiah i mean you
[57:25] think his baptism would hold up real
[57:27] good
[57:28] and in its hour it did i mean because
[57:30] jesus spoke of john and said he was a
[57:32] bright and shining light and you're
[57:34] willing for a season to walk in his
[57:36] light what was he he was the fulfillment
[57:38] of prophecy but then the word moved on
[57:42] god is not static and our walk shouldn't
[57:44] be static either i mean god keeps
[57:46] fulfilling his word he keeps revealing
[57:48] more and more to us right amen and we're
[57:50] going to keep walking as as it says in
[57:52] first john if we walk in the light as he
[57:55] is in the light then the blood of jesus
[57:57] christ cleanses us from all sin and we
[57:58] have fellowship with him
[58:00] right first john 1 7 so what is that
[58:03] like as the word is revealed to you you
[58:05] got to walk in it
[58:08] amen if he calls you to put aside amen
[58:11] fussing and stewing and being a busy
[58:12] body and gossiping and all those things
[58:14] you got to put it aside keep walking
[58:16] with god if you're going to be baptized
[58:17] name the lord jesus christ you won't
[58:19] move any further until you obey what
[58:21] he's told you to do
[58:22] right so we've got to be obedient to god
[58:24] and walk with him
[58:26] amen hey if we stay surrendered we will
[58:30] amen
[58:31] amen because he's the lord he's he's in
[58:33] charge of us amen so but then then said
[58:36] paul john verily baptized with the
[58:38] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[58:40] people that they should believe on him
[58:42] who should come after him that is on
[58:43] christ jesus when they heard this they
[58:45] were baptized in the name of the lord
[58:47] jesus and when paul had laid his hands
[58:49] upon him the holy ghost came on them and
[58:51] they spake with new tongues and
[58:52] prophesied amen so they they had come to
[58:55] a place
[58:56] you know where they'd come and they were
[58:58] preaching that jesus was the christ but
[58:59] that's as far as they got i mean so they
[59:02] came to a place where they're preaching
[59:03] that the message of the hour was true
[59:04] because that was the message of the hour
[59:05] on that day i remember they hadn't
[59:07] received the dynamics to make it live
[59:09] amen and that's what we need today is
[59:11] the holy ghost to come in behind our
[59:13] lives and punctuate every word with an
[59:15] amen i mean to manifest every divine
[59:17] promise of god in our lives that's what
[59:19] we need and that's what he's here to do
[59:22] hallelujah
[59:23] i'm very passionate about this because
[59:26] that's what when i met god i thought
[59:28] everyone's going to meet jesus he's
[59:29] alive everyone's going to believe this
[59:32] and there's still a bit of that in me
[59:33] amen everyone's yeah he's real because
[59:36] he became real to me he stepped out of
[59:37] history and it was more than a story
[59:40] calvary was more than a story or a song
[59:42] i mean it was a reality it was an event
[59:44] it was experience for me hallelujah and
[59:46] i saw that god was not a god of history
[59:48] he's a god of the present i mean that we
[59:51] can meet the lord jesus christ i was so
[59:53] simple in my thinking i thought well if
[59:54] he's alive forevermore he's still alive
[59:56] today
[59:57] and i can meet him i can i can have
[59:59] fellowship with him and he can change me
[1:00:02] come live in my life and i come to find
[1:00:05] out that's exactly
[1:00:06] hallelujah because god does not put a
[1:00:08] promise in his bible
[1:00:10] without
[1:00:11] the faith to fulfill it right this this
[1:00:15] is not empty promises
[1:00:17] there is not a single empty promise in
[1:00:19] this book all the promises are here for
[1:00:22] you have got power
[1:00:23] amen god does not back up on any promise
[1:00:27] mean but he actually wants to put it
[1:00:28] that's why he sent amen the ministry of
[1:00:31] malachi 4 in this day you want to put it
[1:00:33] before our generation say this is what
[1:00:35] my blood does
[1:00:37] i mean that nothing will stand before
[1:00:38] your prayers not even cancer amen demons
[1:00:41] had to fall at his feet amen people were
[1:00:43] healed people delivered i mean the word
[1:00:45] of god was preaching his purity people
[1:00:48] made new creatures in christ storms were
[1:00:50] made to made it disappear life was
[1:00:52] brought back amen
[1:00:54] that's because he was trying to show us
[1:00:56] this is what my blood does
[1:00:58] he took a
[1:00:59] man born in sin a prophet born and
[1:01:01] sinned who had to give his life and he
[1:01:03] was redeemed by the same blood we
[1:01:04] redeemed you and i and he wanted god
[1:01:06] want to show us this is what the cross
[1:01:08] achieves and he didn't do it just for us
[1:01:11] to talk about it he did it to show us
[1:01:13] actually you can know the same jesus
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:18] amen that your life can be built upon
[1:01:20] the word of god
[1:01:22] and not emotion not anything else but
[1:01:24] upon the word of god
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:28] so they had to come into they had to
[1:01:31] receive the holy ghost now if i could
[1:01:32] parallel that with i'm going to get into
[1:01:34] it later but you know their stony hearts
[1:01:36] were taken away
[1:01:38] and and and the stony heart was taken
[1:01:40] away god can deal with you
[1:01:42] right there you say they even received a
[1:01:43] new spirit but they hadn't received the
[1:01:45] holy ghost yet
[1:01:47] amen and then and then we go into the
[1:01:48] book of acts we find philip who's a
[1:01:50] deacon went down to the city of samaria
[1:01:53] and and he was preaching christ unto
[1:01:55] them now this is in acts 8 uh verses 5
[1:01:58] to 17 if you want to put that up you
[1:02:01] know and and so philip went down there
[1:02:03] and the people were of one accord this
[1:02:05] is verse six now amen and gave heed unto
[1:02:08] those things which philip spake hearing
[1:02:10] and seeing the miracles which he did so
[1:02:12] here was he was a part of the body
[1:02:14] filled with the holy ghost went down to
[1:02:16] samara begin to preach with power and
[1:02:17] demonstration
[1:02:19] as as as the prophet said i mean
[1:02:22] teaching the gospel is not what
[1:02:24] jesus commissioners are he said to
[1:02:25] preach it and preaching is with pound
[1:02:27] demonstration of the holy ghost it
[1:02:29] doesn't matter how dynamic or not
[1:02:31] dynamic the minister is it's when god
[1:02:33] comes in behind it and manifests what he
[1:02:35] says that's preaching the gospel amen
[1:02:38] and we've been commissioned in this hour
[1:02:39] to go preach the gospel to every
[1:02:41] creature and that's just not someone who
[1:02:42] stands here that's now everyday life to
[1:02:44] everyone
[1:02:46] amen we live a life filled with the holy
[1:02:48] ghost i mean to phillips preaching and
[1:02:51] everyone's giving heed and rejoicing and
[1:02:54] then they even seen the miracles which
[1:02:55] he did verse seven it says for unclean
[1:02:58] spirits crying with loud voice came out
[1:03:00] of many that were possessed with them
[1:03:02] and many taken with palsies and that
[1:03:04] were lame were healed
[1:03:06] now notice in verse 8 there was great
[1:03:08] joy in the city so they were rejoicing
[1:03:10] in the message of the hour they were
[1:03:12] praising god god's come among us he's
[1:03:14] not a god of history no more he's alive
[1:03:17] amen he's here i mean he shed his blood
[1:03:19] upon calvary now we're believers
[1:03:21] hallelujah and so they were rejoicing
[1:03:25] hey there is great joy in the city when
[1:03:27] jesus steps in i trust this great joy in
[1:03:30] your city and your life when jesus
[1:03:32] stepped in hallelujah
[1:03:34] amen but there was a certain man called
[1:03:36] simon we're just going to keep reading
[1:03:38] verse 9 which before time in the same
[1:03:40] city use sorcery and but which the
[1:03:42] people of samaria giving out that
[1:03:44] himself was some great one
[1:03:46] to whom they all gave feed from the
[1:03:48] least of the greatest saying this man is
[1:03:50] the great power of god
[1:03:53] and to him they had regard because of a
[1:03:54] long time he had bewitched them with
[1:03:56] sorceries but when they believed philip
[1:03:59] preaching the things concerning the
[1:04:00] kingdom of god and the name of jesus
[1:04:02] christ are baptized both men and women
[1:04:05] so here they didn't just have some kind
[1:04:07] of confession you know just uh i believe
[1:04:09] jesus but they got repented and they
[1:04:11] were baptized
[1:04:12] amen so they're on their way but notice
[1:04:14] this now verse 13 then simon himself
[1:04:16] believed also and when he was baptized
[1:04:19] he continued with philip and wandered by
[1:04:21] holding the miracles and signs which
[1:04:22] were done so he became a message
[1:04:24] believer too
[1:04:25] i'm a believer praise the lord
[1:04:27] hallelujah but notice now but when the
[1:04:29] the apostles
[1:04:31] verse 14 now when the apostles which are
[1:04:34] at jerusalem heard that samaria had
[1:04:35] received the word of god they sent under
[1:04:38] them peter and john who when thou come
[1:04:40] down prayed for them that they might
[1:04:42] receive the holy ghost so they received
[1:04:45] the word
[1:04:47] but they had not received the holy ghost
[1:04:49] that's why it's such a deception of the
[1:04:52] devil where people are told just receive
[1:04:54] the message and you have the holy ghost
[1:04:56] no no the holy ghost must come in you've
[1:04:59] got to receive the word but the holy
[1:05:01] ghost has got to come in and make that
[1:05:03] message live in your life
[1:05:05] amen so it's not just a mental or a
[1:05:07] baptist confession no change saying i
[1:05:09] believe god's seen a prophet that's not
[1:05:12] it that's not going to take you in a
[1:05:13] rapture you've got to meet the god of
[1:05:14] the bible
[1:05:16] if i say that for the rest of my life
[1:05:17] that's what we're going to do to
[1:05:19] nominate the power of his resurrection
[1:05:21] it's absolutely essential
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:26] four verse 16 for as yet he was fallen
[1:05:29] upon none of them only they were
[1:05:31] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:05:34] they had been baptized right they were
[1:05:36] they were they were rejoicing in the
[1:05:37] right thing the word of the hour that
[1:05:40] praising god they saw there was a holy
[1:05:42] ghost filled minister in their midst
[1:05:43] preaching miracles were done but they
[1:05:46] hadn't received the holy ghost yet
[1:05:48] it's absolutely fundamentally important
[1:05:52] you must be born again
[1:05:55] you know you must be born again
[1:05:58] see people say like brother ram says in
[1:06:00] the token message people say but brother
[1:06:02] brown we believe every word you say
[1:06:04] he says that's good but that's just
[1:06:05] being able to read
[1:06:07] you must receive the token the holy
[1:06:08] ghost
[1:06:09] so we can't stand upon man's opinion
[1:06:12] saying well i've received a message
[1:06:13] therefore i'm going no no you've got to
[1:06:15] be born again you've got to have a
[1:06:17] definite experience where the lord
[1:06:19] changes your life you can look back and
[1:06:21] now you see him living in you
[1:06:24] amen you must have that experience it's
[1:06:26] absolutely vital you can call me
[1:06:28] whatever you want to we don't deny the
[1:06:30] word here i believe the whole world is
[1:06:32] open
[1:06:33] i have no problem p people preaching
[1:06:35] about the thunders i don't care about
[1:06:36] the scarecrows you know or the seventh
[1:06:38] seal being open or the perugia i don't
[1:06:40] care about the scarecrows i just bypass
[1:06:42] it because i know there's food in there
[1:06:44] somewhere i mean so i'm not afraid of
[1:06:46] any of that stuff
[1:06:48] amen i don't care about scarecrows it
[1:06:50] doesn't scare me
[1:06:52] i'm not a crow
[1:06:54] right so there's none of the word that i
[1:06:57] say we shouldn't go there let's go
[1:06:58] everywhere like joshua's told the whole
[1:07:00] land go possess it
[1:07:02] every divine promise
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:06] but they had to receive
[1:07:09] the holy ghost
[1:07:10] they received the word
[1:07:12] but you need the word and the spirit
[1:07:14] together
[1:07:17] amen
[1:07:18] because it's true i mean it's exactly
[1:07:21] unfortunately in the bible we we can
[1:07:23] taste of the good word of god
[1:07:25] but just tasting is not enough it's good
[1:07:29] i rejoice when god falls on people
[1:07:31] frankly i wish it happened a lot more
[1:07:33] amen we had a sunday night camp meaning
[1:07:35] every service praise the lord
[1:07:37] doesn't matter who preaches how
[1:07:40] how charismatic or not how
[1:07:42] deep or shallow people want to quantify
[1:07:44] it as long as god moves in the service
[1:07:46] touches my life touches our lives that's
[1:07:48] what we want we want who wants jesus
[1:07:51] i want you jesus come live in me
[1:07:54] that's how we should be every hour of
[1:07:55] every day i want to die daily lord you
[1:07:57] live in me i want you to live in me for
[1:08:00] your glory
[1:08:01] amen not that people would see me i'm
[1:08:03] not interested in that i want him to be
[1:08:04] glorified i want his word to be
[1:08:06] glorified
[1:08:08] hallelujah
[1:08:10] amen so says in hebrews 6 and 4 sorry
[1:08:12] we're still going on here for it is
[1:08:14] impossible for those who once
[1:08:15] enlightened and tasted of the heavenly
[1:08:17] gift
[1:08:18] and we're made partakers of the holy
[1:08:20] ghost these people have who have who
[1:08:22] have tasted yes not just heard but
[1:08:24] they've tasted they've experienced the
[1:08:26] power of god
[1:08:28] amen and have tasted the good word of
[1:08:30] god and the powers of the world to come
[1:08:33] if they shall fall away and renew again
[1:08:35] and renew them again unto repentance
[1:08:37] saying they crucified themselves the son
[1:08:38] of god afresh and put him to an open
[1:08:40] shame now that's not someone who
[1:08:42] backslides and goes into the world
[1:08:44] that's someone who actually counts the
[1:08:45] word of god as some unholy thing it's a
[1:08:48] cult it's it's it's a man following
[1:08:49] group it's got you know it's just
[1:08:51] man-made thing it's it's it's antichrist
[1:08:54] all right now god's the judge remember
[1:08:56] don't you put anyone out
[1:08:59] amen god god god does that god brings
[1:09:02] people in he does what he wants so don't
[1:09:04] don't don't put people in that box that
[1:09:06] they're beyond redemption if there's
[1:09:07] life in the body they can be saved
[1:09:10] that's how i believe it amen if there's
[1:09:12] life there's still hope
[1:09:14] amen said don't don't ever throw someone
[1:09:16] away
[1:09:17] amen jesus didn't throw you away he
[1:09:19] didn't throw me away
[1:09:20] i mean we should have the mind of christ
[1:09:24] but what i'm trying to get here is
[1:09:25] people can just taste but you've got to
[1:09:27] go in the way because if you keep re if
[1:09:29] you go into ephesians says grieve you're
[1:09:31] not the holy ghost who by your seal into
[1:09:33] the day of your redemption so if you get
[1:09:35] to that place where you're sealed in you
[1:09:37] can't
[1:09:38] you can't be lost
[1:09:40] there's actually a satisfying
[1:09:42] revelation and anchor in your soul
[1:09:45] doesn't matter if you're having a good
[1:09:46] day bad day up and down how you feel
[1:09:49] you're sealed in
[1:09:51] you know in whom you have believed
[1:09:53] amen you base your experience on the
[1:09:55] word of god this is what we're gonna do
[1:09:57] you gotta take your experience back to
[1:09:59] the word amen that you can actually
[1:10:01] based on the word of god you say i am a
[1:10:04] believer
[1:10:05] amen i've i've repented i've fully
[1:10:07] surrendered my whole life i've been
[1:10:09] baptized named the lord jesus christ and
[1:10:12] i have received the holy ghost there's
[1:10:13] been a real definite change
[1:10:19] as as jeremiah would prophesy in
[1:10:21] jeremiah 31 and 33
[1:10:24] he says but this now now this is
[1:10:26] speaking of this is speaking of the new
[1:10:28] testament era because under the blood of
[1:10:30] bulls and goats this could never be
[1:10:32] accomplished because the blood of bulls
[1:10:33] and goats only covered sin it never
[1:10:35] changed the sin nature of the person
[1:10:37] that brought the offering i mean so if i
[1:10:40] was living under the blood of bulls and
[1:10:41] goats and i did a sin and i had to had
[1:10:43] to you know
[1:10:45] give an offering to a time for my sin i
[1:10:48] know whatever the sin is i'd bring my
[1:10:50] lamb and if the lamb were yeah and then
[1:10:52] the lamb would be examined by the priest
[1:10:54] i was not examined the lamb was examined
[1:10:56] or the bullock or the goat whatever it
[1:10:58] is right and if it was found to be
[1:11:00] without blemish then it was offered on
[1:11:02] my behalf and i could walk away praising
[1:11:05] jehovah god because that lamb or that
[1:11:08] offering the wrath that i should have
[1:11:10] received was poured out upon it and i
[1:11:12] can walk away justified
[1:11:14] we have a perfect lamb today
[1:11:16] though we fall though we fail i mean we
[1:11:19] you know he was bruised for our
[1:11:20] iniquities if you want a good if you
[1:11:22] want a good memory verse to memorize
[1:11:24] memorize isaiah 53
[1:11:26] he was bruised for my iniquities the
[1:11:29] chastisement of his peace i'm sorry my
[1:11:31] peace was upon him and by his stripes
[1:11:35] i'm healed
[1:11:36] i mean he was wounded from my iniquity
[1:11:39] you should you should read that memorize
[1:11:41] it because that's my lamb
[1:11:44] hallelujah
[1:11:46] amen but the thing is the new testament
[1:11:47] i mean in the old testament era after i
[1:11:50] did that the same desire that same
[1:11:52] fallen nature that caused me to sin in
[1:11:54] the first place i walk away with
[1:11:57] because the life in my sacrifice could
[1:11:59] never come upon me and change me
[1:12:02] but because that was under the blood of
[1:12:03] bulls goats but now under the blood of
[1:12:05] jesus christ
[1:12:07] our sin is not just covered
[1:12:09] right it is done away with in the blood
[1:12:12] of jesus christ and the life that was in
[1:12:14] that blood comes into me and changes my
[1:12:17] nature so so the sin nature that made me
[1:12:20] say i need a lamb i'm lost i'm a sinner
[1:12:23] i don't walk away with that nature
[1:12:25] amen as the blood is rarely applied amen
[1:12:28] amen he changes your nature
[1:12:31] hallelujah
[1:12:34] but you see so this could never be
[1:12:35] fulfilled in the old testament he says
[1:12:37] but this shall be the covenant that i
[1:12:39] will make with the house of israel after
[1:12:41] those days saith the lord i'll put my
[1:12:43] law in their inward parts and write it
[1:12:46] in their hearts and it shall be and and
[1:12:48] it will be their god so the word will be
[1:12:50] their god amen what is the word of god
[1:12:53] it's our god who is jesus he is the word
[1:12:56] right and they shall be my people
[1:12:59] hallelujah so the only way that could
[1:13:01] happen is the holy holy ghost comes in
[1:13:04] takes the word and writes it at our
[1:13:06] hearts changes our nature and that can
[1:13:08] only happen under the blood of jesus
[1:13:10] christ amen the apostle paul would pick
[1:13:12] this up in hebrews 10
[1:13:14] and verse 14 and and he would say this
[1:13:16] here amen
[1:13:20] for by one offering
[1:13:21] not continually year by year
[1:13:24] he has perfected forever them that are
[1:13:26] sanctified
[1:13:29] i just read about you by the way
[1:13:31] by one offering a perfect offering
[1:13:33] there's no interest need to be paid off
[1:13:35] it was paid in full
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:38] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[1:13:41] to us
[1:13:42] that after that he had said before this
[1:13:46] is the covenant that i'll make with them
[1:13:47] after those days saith the lord i'll put
[1:13:50] my laws into their hearts and in their
[1:13:51] minds will i write them and their sins
[1:13:53] and iniquities will i remember no more
[1:13:57] hallelujah so so the apostle paul is
[1:13:59] taking prophecy and god is saying it's
[1:14:02] no longer prophecy it's happening
[1:14:05] hallelujah
[1:14:06] amen who's had that kind of experience
[1:14:09] hallelujah that really you know it's the
[1:14:11] word of god on the inside so he's going
[1:14:13] to be the inside teacher it's not just
[1:14:15] us saying now stop doing this and wear
[1:14:17] this and do this and change this and
[1:14:19] no he's got to be there should be
[1:14:21] something on the inside when you go to
[1:14:22] reach for the wrong thing he should say
[1:14:24] i don't like that you have to yield to
[1:14:26] that though right because he doesn't
[1:14:28] make you a robot none of us are robots
[1:14:30] right this is not god putting you in a
[1:14:32] mold and just pushing you out like some
[1:14:34] factory no it's got to be a willing
[1:14:36] heart
[1:14:37] come live every day come do what you
[1:14:39] want to do every day do that which is
[1:14:41] pleasing in your sight in my life
[1:14:44] hallelujah
[1:14:46] amen now
[1:14:48] if we go to first corinthians 13
[1:14:51] the apostle paul picks up how it's
[1:14:53] charity or divine love which must rule
[1:14:57] and we are living in the age of divine
[1:14:58] love
[1:14:59] hallelujah it's not coming it's here
[1:15:02] amen that capstone of divine love is
[1:15:04] upon the church holy and individuals you
[1:15:06] see divine love manifested they don't
[1:15:08] have to try and love people they just do
[1:15:11] hallelujah
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] hallelujah
[1:15:16] now
[1:15:19] uh we're in verse one here
[1:15:22] he says though i speak now now i just
[1:15:24] want you to notice
[1:15:27] i'm going to cover this all in our you
[1:15:29] know ezekiel here but
[1:15:31] this is so fundamental
[1:15:34] what is your experience based
[1:15:36] upon what is your christian walk based
[1:15:39] upon
[1:15:40] is it is it based upon emotion
[1:15:43] is it based upon you know a lot of
[1:15:45] doctrine
[1:15:47] what is your christian walk based upon
[1:15:49] it must boil down to the word of god
[1:15:52] that you've come according to his word
[1:15:55] and you've met the author of the book
[1:15:58] right and your life is now a
[1:16:00] manifestation of the word
[1:16:03] right that you know because
[1:16:04] how how are we getting to heaven i'm not
[1:16:06] getting to heaven on the anointing that
[1:16:08] i've received i mean in terms of to
[1:16:10] preach and to shout and run around and
[1:16:12] rejoice no i'm getting to heaven because
[1:16:15] his blood the life in his blood has
[1:16:18] cleansed my soul right i came has
[1:16:20] provided way amen i repented was
[1:16:23] baptized name and lord jesus christ and
[1:16:25] i received the holy ghost
[1:16:26] right that is that is the way jesus says
[1:16:28] i am the door he is the word and that's
[1:16:31] the door
[1:16:32] right you gotta you gotta come god's
[1:16:33] provided way
[1:16:36] but don't just stop by repenting don't
[1:16:38] just stop keep going
[1:16:40] don't just repent and stop there or
[1:16:41] don't just get baptized and stop there
[1:16:43] see the problem is
[1:16:45] this may sound wrong but the problem is
[1:16:47] we raise a lot of good kids
[1:16:51] but they seem so close
[1:16:54] but where's the infilling of the holy
[1:16:56] ghost
[1:16:58] right or even we raise good adults
[1:17:02] and and the thing is things can become
[1:17:04] we can become creatures of habit
[1:17:06] it just becomes habit to come to church
[1:17:08] it becomes habit to dress the right way
[1:17:10] it becomes habit to pray or listen to
[1:17:12] the message or it just becomes a habit
[1:17:14] because we become creatures of habit
[1:17:17] and it can look so good and all those
[1:17:19] things we should do
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:22] but unless god comes down
[1:17:25] makes it live
[1:17:27] it's all in vain
[1:17:28] don't just stop get in
[1:17:33] you may think i'm angry i'm not angry
[1:17:35] i love you very much
[1:17:37] i want us all to make it
[1:17:39] jesus christ and we can't be numb to the
[1:17:42] condition of this world and oh we've got
[1:17:44] hundreds you know we've got 50 odd years
[1:17:46] we may just have today
[1:17:49] you know
[1:17:50] there's a lot of last days for a lot of
[1:17:51] people right now the lord comes for a
[1:17:53] lot of people right now so it's not just
[1:17:56] the coming of the lord but the lord
[1:17:57] could come for you today
[1:18:00] right we want to be we want to be ready
[1:18:02] now because we can't get ready there we
[1:18:04] get ready here
[1:18:07] so though i speak with tongues of men
[1:18:08] and angels and have not charity divine
[1:18:10] love i become as a sounding brass or a
[1:18:13] tinkling symbol
[1:18:14] and though i have the gift gift of
[1:18:16] prophecy
[1:18:17] and understand what's that word all
[1:18:22] mysteries
[1:18:23] so the apostle paul can say and uh
[1:18:26] because there's a problem people cabbage
[1:18:27] down if i can use that kind of term
[1:18:30] but i see the words open
[1:18:33] he says you can understand all mysteries
[1:18:35] you can know how the seals tied together
[1:18:37] with the church ages with the vials and
[1:18:39] the thunders and all the different
[1:18:40] things and you can have it exactly
[1:18:42] perfectly right
[1:18:44] but if you don't have charity divine
[1:18:46] love you ain't going
[1:18:49] right so we don't want to be stuck on
[1:18:51] well i have an understanding sure when
[1:18:53] the spirit of truth comes he will lead
[1:18:54] you and guide you into all truth but
[1:18:56] there's a very different thing between a
[1:18:58] revelation and head knowledge you can
[1:19:00] forget head knowledge but a revelation
[1:19:03] becomes part of you you cannot forget it
[1:19:05] right so don't call a revelation
[1:19:07] something you learn and you forget a
[1:19:09] revelation is something that anchors in
[1:19:11] your heart you cannot forget it because
[1:19:13] you become part of that revelation
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:17] and all knowledge
[1:19:19] and i have all faith that i could remove
[1:19:22] mountains and have not charity i am
[1:19:23] nothing so i could stand here and i
[1:19:25] could list off supernatural things after
[1:19:27] supernatural things and god did this and
[1:19:30] god moved this and god raised this
[1:19:31] person from the dead
[1:19:33] but if i don't have charity i'm nothing
[1:19:36] but in saying all that
[1:19:39] we don't throw away speaking in tongues
[1:19:41] now i'm back in verse 1.
[1:19:42] amen we do not throw away gifts of
[1:19:45] prophecy
[1:19:46] right we do not throw away all the
[1:19:48] mysteries and all knowledge amen we do
[1:19:51] not throw away faith to move mountains
[1:19:54] so you don't throw those things away i
[1:19:55] just need divine love no if you get
[1:19:57] divine love all those things will be
[1:19:59] added unto you
[1:20:01] right so we don't throw those things
[1:20:02] away
[1:20:05] amen and though i bestow all my goods to
[1:20:08] feed the poor
[1:20:09] and though i give my body to be burned
[1:20:11] and have not charity it profiteth me
[1:20:14] nothing that's the words of well that's
[1:20:15] god's words
[1:20:17] so
[1:20:18] we don't just want to start
[1:20:20] and come halfway
[1:20:22] and think i'm there
[1:20:24] we must go all the way in
[1:20:26] all the way in now because people yeah
[1:20:28] and and i said it before but i've
[1:20:30] received the message brother ben i'm a
[1:20:32] believer
[1:20:33] there must be a power in that
[1:20:36] to transform you
[1:20:37] because jesus said well yeah i'll say
[1:20:40] jesus because when john wrote the gospel
[1:20:42] of john it wasn't john
[1:20:44] that was jesus writing through john
[1:20:45] remember every every word in this
[1:20:47] scripture is divinely inspired
[1:20:49] amen
[1:20:50] otherwise
[1:20:52] our god can't keep his own word whom
[1:20:54] he's going to judge the world by
[1:20:58] this word is inspired
[1:21:00] every word and i and i believe the
[1:21:02] cover's inspired also the holy bible
[1:21:05] hallelujah i believe that's inspired too
[1:21:08] amen from kevin to kiva
[1:21:10] and the kevin also
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:14] you thought oh you've just gone off the
[1:21:15] deep end i found something
[1:21:18] i found the pearl of great price
[1:21:20] i found the greatest treasure you could
[1:21:22] ever find is the lord jesus more than
[1:21:25] church more than good singing more than
[1:21:28] doctrine but the person
[1:21:30] amen of the word i felt he found me
[1:21:32] rather
[1:21:33] hallelujah and i wouldn't trade it for
[1:21:35] nothing
[1:21:36] i wouldn't trade him for nothing
[1:21:38] so he says in first john 1 and 12 and
[1:21:41] 13.
[1:21:42] he says but as many as received him
[1:21:44] remember he is the word
[1:21:46] so as many as received the word
[1:21:49] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:21:52] of god
[1:21:53] even to them that believe on his name so
[1:21:55] if you've really received the word then
[1:21:58] a power comes in to transform you
[1:22:01] into a son or daughter of god
[1:22:03] from what you really are from the
[1:22:04] beginning comes to life
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:10] amen so now let's go back to ezekiel
[1:22:14] so
[1:22:15] there's an order here
[1:22:18] you start with a stone he calls you
[1:22:21] out of all the heathen out of all the
[1:22:22] religions all the different things he
[1:22:23] calls you to the word to himself
[1:22:26] but we start off with a stony heart
[1:22:29] now that stony heart can be religious
[1:22:32] the scribes and pharisees brother um
[1:22:33] said had a stony heart
[1:22:36] so so we can be we can we can be up to
[1:22:38] our eyeballs and the eyeballs also full
[1:22:40] of the message but with a stony heart
[1:22:43] just an intellectual understanding of
[1:22:44] that that can just be a stony heart and
[1:22:46] that's not in
[1:22:48] but yet it can look in
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:52] so now
[1:22:54] he says now now there's just a few
[1:22:56] quotes from the uh the impersonation of
[1:22:58] christianity 1957 to me this is
[1:23:00] incredible that's god's order not a big
[1:23:03] school with a degree but a living acting
[1:23:05] experience of the holy spirit not
[1:23:07] fanaticism but the real genuine holy
[1:23:09] spirit put in action may you see it as
[1:23:11] my prayer now notice the order of the
[1:23:13] scripture it's perfect god said first
[1:23:15] i'll take away the old stoning heart you
[1:23:18] can't receive nothing so you can have a
[1:23:20] not head full of knowledge
[1:23:22] but the word can't correct you
[1:23:24] right you can't receive nothing then he
[1:23:26] said i'll give you a new spirit now that
[1:23:28] ain't the holy spirit and he says in
[1:23:30] what thank you of christ i can hear him
[1:23:32] reach out over there and say come here
[1:23:34] east wind westward north and south i
[1:23:36] tell you everything's in the solar
[1:23:37] system and in the heavens obeys him and
[1:23:40] turns at his command but the heart of
[1:23:43] man
[1:23:44] who thinks they know more than god does
[1:23:46] he can't touch the stony heart of man
[1:23:50] so if you're sitting here today and you
[1:23:52] think more
[1:23:53] than what the word does
[1:23:56] right and you can be a believer you say
[1:23:58] i'm a fourth generation believer you can
[1:23:59] still be a have a stony heart right so
[1:24:02] if your reasoning if you place your
[1:24:04] reasoning above the word of god
[1:24:07] and you that's you saying i know more
[1:24:09] than the word does
[1:24:11] and he says and he can't touch that
[1:24:13] stony heart
[1:24:15] take it from us lord
[1:24:17] take it from us lord i put myself here
[1:24:18] too
[1:24:21] so we don't want to reason away the
[1:24:22] truth of the scripture and take man's
[1:24:25] opinion and their own reasoning
[1:24:27] that is still a stony heart no matter
[1:24:30] how good it may sound if it's contrary
[1:24:32] to the scripture you forget the
[1:24:33] reasoning and you stay with this word
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:38] and then he says now so so but what
[1:24:40] happens when the stony heart is taken
[1:24:42] away you get a heart of flesh now you're
[1:24:44] flexible to the word
[1:24:45] you actually begin to see actually this
[1:24:47] is true
[1:24:49] right and the spirit speaking through
[1:24:51] this brother a few minutes ago said i'll
[1:24:53] take that stony heart out of you this is
[1:24:55] from leadership 1965
[1:24:57] and give you a heart of flesh tender
[1:24:59] towards god
[1:25:01] so with the stony heart you can be full
[1:25:03] of religion but you can't be you can't
[1:25:05] be moved by god god can't work with that
[1:25:07] but then he takes that stony heart and
[1:25:09] gives you a heart of flesh that now
[1:25:11] you're tender towards god what does that
[1:25:14] mean you're willing to be shaped and
[1:25:16] molded by the word
[1:25:17] right because a heart of stone cannot be
[1:25:19] shaped
[1:25:20] it's just a rock and there it is but if
[1:25:22] it becomes tender and soft then it can
[1:25:24] be molded and shaped by the word
[1:25:27] that's what we want to have isn't it
[1:25:29] we don't want to be strong i don't want
[1:25:30] to have a stony heart and indifferent
[1:25:32] and you can't tell me nothing and don't
[1:25:34] tell me nothing and i know this and did
[1:25:35] but brother brahm said this here and
[1:25:37] this quote here and this scripture here
[1:25:38] you know no we don't want to be that way
[1:25:41] we want to have a tender heart that god
[1:25:43] can mold us and speak to us and correct
[1:25:45] us
[1:25:46] amen now this is a work of god
[1:25:49] right now look how it's become now just
[1:25:51] an intellectual emotion see not a tender
[1:25:54] heart full of love and sweetness towards
[1:25:56] christ
[1:25:58] so that's a that's a heart of flesh
[1:26:01] a heart
[1:26:02] full of love and sweetness towards
[1:26:04] christ that's a work of
[1:26:06] god so as we go through this don't
[1:26:09] despise the first part because it's got
[1:26:11] to start there and end here
[1:26:13] right so and praise the lord if he's
[1:26:15] done all three wherever you are get to
[1:26:17] the end where you're filled with his
[1:26:19] holy ghost and he lives out of you
[1:26:21] amen so to be tender towards god be able
[1:26:23] to be molded and shaped by his word this
[1:26:25] is this is when someone receives a heart
[1:26:28] of flesh
[1:26:29] and i say this that many of us
[1:26:32] you know even even even young children
[1:26:34] can be this way
[1:26:36] right but then if we sit here service
[1:26:38] after service time after time nothing
[1:26:41] changes i'd say lord take my stony heart
[1:26:44] away
[1:26:45] don't be deceived by the devil amen but
[1:26:48] say god change i come here to be changed
[1:26:51] i don't come here to well i stand here
[1:26:53] and preach but i don't stand here to
[1:26:54] preach you i said lord preach to me
[1:26:56] i mean when you know when i'm praying
[1:26:59] when i when i'm hearing the message
[1:27:01] change me and even when take this vocal
[1:27:03] cord speak something and change me with
[1:27:05] it
[1:27:06] amen that's how i feel i come to church
[1:27:08] i want to be more like jesus more like
[1:27:10] his word
[1:27:12] amen but so don't just stop with a
[1:27:15] tender heart full of love and sweetness
[1:27:16] towards christ we should have that we
[1:27:19] must have that
[1:27:20] amen how can we if we don't love him how
[1:27:22] can we serve him
[1:27:24] if we don't love him how can we have
[1:27:25] faith in him
[1:27:27] because faith and love are like husband
[1:27:28] and wife
[1:27:30] i mean they work together right so we
[1:27:32] must love him if you've become cold amen
[1:27:35] say lord take the coldness away if you
[1:27:37] become indifferent say lord take the
[1:27:39] indifference away
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:43] he says here father now he's praying we
[1:27:45] want to be like moses we want to be led
[1:27:47] by your holy son jesus christ to eternal
[1:27:50] life give it to our hearts right lord
[1:27:52] tear out the old stony heart place into
[1:27:54] us a new heart
[1:27:56] the heart of flesh the heart that you
[1:27:58] can talk to and deal with and we will
[1:28:00] not be haunty or different
[1:28:03] what is being horny and different
[1:28:04] basically you can't tell me
[1:28:06] again i've heard this a million times
[1:28:09] well that doesn't mean nothing that's a
[1:28:10] stony heart we want to have a heart of
[1:28:12] flesh that god can actually we can be
[1:28:14] corrected
[1:28:15] i mean you know the zeal of this age
[1:28:17] just be zealous therefore and repent
[1:28:19] that is that's the zeal of the ladies
[1:28:21] and age so if you want to be a zealous
[1:28:23] believer and be quick to repent
[1:28:26] be quick to say i'm wrong oh god change
[1:28:28] me that's the zeal of this age because
[1:28:31] this age you can't tell no one nothing
[1:28:33] everyone has an answer and if they don't
[1:28:35] have it in here they have it here 0.246
[1:28:38] of a second they have 5 000 million
[1:28:40] results and hits and there it is and
[1:28:42] they think they know what they're
[1:28:43] talking about god knows what he's
[1:28:45] talking about
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:47] amen or they just have a message search
[1:28:49] program or a scripture program they just
[1:28:51] no no we don't want to be like that say
[1:28:53] lord
[1:28:54] heart of flesh
[1:28:56] that you can talk to and deal with
[1:28:59] that we will not be haunty and different
[1:29:03] amen may the holy spirit never leave me
[1:29:05] this is in leadership when the last
[1:29:06] message is the prophet preaches lord may
[1:29:08] i come and ordain this people speak to
[1:29:10] them tear up their stony wills and put
[1:29:13] the will of god save everyone father
[1:29:15] give us of thy love
[1:29:18] hallelujah
[1:29:19] so
[1:29:21] that's an incredible thing to happen
[1:29:23] but don't stop there
[1:29:26] don't stop there
[1:29:27] we want to we want to receive his spirit
[1:29:31] amen so now
[1:29:33] now we're coming to the new spirit
[1:29:36] this is very deceptive
[1:29:39] because many people think they have the
[1:29:40] holy ghost when they just have a new
[1:29:42] spirit
[1:29:43] and we don't want to be deceived because
[1:29:45] it's an incredible change even to go
[1:29:47] from a place where you don't care about
[1:29:49] god you've got a stony heart you know
[1:29:51] you never darken a church door never
[1:29:52] open a bible you know never listen to
[1:29:55] the message but then god changes that
[1:29:56] heart to a heart of flesh that's an
[1:29:58] incredible thing well you want to lord i
[1:30:00] want to meet you jesus you're alive
[1:30:01] where are you you know that's an
[1:30:03] incredible
[1:30:04] thing and then also the new spirit is an
[1:30:07] incredible thing
[1:30:09] but we don't want to be stuck just with
[1:30:11] a new spirit
[1:30:12] now the old spirit
[1:30:14] we can't even live with our siblings we
[1:30:15] can't live with our family you can't
[1:30:17] even live with yourself fussing fighting
[1:30:19] there's got to always be some kind of
[1:30:21] fight too there's got to be something to
[1:30:22] rally behind a grudge to pick up
[1:30:25] something to you know resent me to lift
[1:30:26] up some kind of fight well she did this
[1:30:28] and he did this and this person is wrong
[1:30:31] that's that's still
[1:30:34] you need a new spirit
[1:30:35] remember no matter how religious how
[1:30:37] many quotes how you dress you can you
[1:30:40] can you can be the epitome on the
[1:30:41] outside of a believer
[1:30:43] but if you've still got an old spirit
[1:30:45] there'll always be some kind of battle
[1:30:47] and normally someone like this is not
[1:30:49] much peace between the two
[1:30:51] i just fought this battle and now
[1:30:53] there's this and they always bring up
[1:30:54] the past of this and you said this and
[1:30:55] this and this she did this and this
[1:30:58] that's an old spirit there's always
[1:30:59] contention there's always trouble
[1:31:00] there's always fussing there's always
[1:31:02] something going wrong that they just
[1:31:04] can't be happy they just can't let it go
[1:31:06] they pick up something and say well this
[1:31:08] person did last year you did this to me
[1:31:10] and this birth and she did this and they
[1:31:12] just can't let it go that's an old that
[1:31:14] is not a new spirit yet
[1:31:17] so if there's always
[1:31:19] fussing and fighting around you
[1:31:22] there's a common denominator in all
[1:31:23] those walls
[1:31:25] oh yes
[1:31:29] you gotta
[1:31:30] jesus said
[1:31:32] don't go to your brother and say let me
[1:31:33] take the little basically the little
[1:31:35] twig out of their eye when you've got a
[1:31:36] beam in your own he says but first take
[1:31:39] the beam out of your own eye
[1:31:41] that you can help your brother how do
[1:31:43] you do that you actually go to the lord
[1:31:44] say lord
[1:31:46] search me oh lord and try me today
[1:31:48] search me oh lord be in prayer lord
[1:31:51] there's something in me that's
[1:31:52] displeasing
[1:31:55] but if there's always contention and
[1:31:57] strife around you you need a new spirit
[1:31:59] amen right there's always trouble
[1:32:02] remember if the holy ghost is within you
[1:32:04] even if you have a new spirit there
[1:32:05] should be peace
[1:32:06] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:32:08] shall see god
[1:32:10] i mean jesus said in the beatitudes
[1:32:13] so
[1:32:15] we don't want to he says no this isn't
[1:32:17] this isn't the impersonation of
[1:32:18] christianity again he says there is the
[1:32:20] mistake has been made a lot of people
[1:32:22] many people rather come to the altar to
[1:32:23] pray and they get down to praying and
[1:32:26] praying they get a feeling a little
[1:32:27] better they might get up and on and jump
[1:32:29] around a little while and after a while
[1:32:31] they find out they just bounce bounce
[1:32:33] bounce and back down
[1:32:35] this is a new spirit so they go from
[1:32:37] camp experience to camp experience
[1:32:40] right we need those camp experiences
[1:32:42] right we need that time away but we
[1:32:44] can't just go bounce bounce bounce and
[1:32:46] stay down
[1:32:48] right that's not what we're called to be
[1:32:50] we're not called to go from labor week
[1:32:52] into labor weekend right
[1:32:54] i i need another camp experience though
[1:32:57] yeah if you take the book of acts i'm
[1:32:58] just going to jump ahead
[1:33:00] those that receive the the study hall
[1:33:03] was taken away they got a heart of flesh
[1:33:04] they got a new spirit then the spirit of
[1:33:06] god came and dwelt in them how did they
[1:33:08] go
[1:33:09] the book of acts believers they were
[1:33:11] filled with the holy ghost they received
[1:33:13] the new spirit trouble came in they
[1:33:15] didn't fuss back
[1:33:17] they said we're just going to serve god
[1:33:18] so we please god or man and then the
[1:33:20] devil put pressure on them they just had
[1:33:22] a prayer meeting god came down and then
[1:33:24] they just kept walking on
[1:33:26] amen and to me that's how we should be
[1:33:28] you've got trouble in your life don't
[1:33:30] just spread to everyone on whatsapp amen
[1:33:32] no go to prayer
[1:33:34] first and foremost i mean don't be a
[1:33:36] busy body you know people it says in the
[1:33:38] bible women and you know busy bodies are
[1:33:40] going from house to house being
[1:33:41] everyone's business now you can be in
[1:33:43] everyone's business with this
[1:33:45] even if that spirit's on you you've got
[1:33:46] to get rid of it
[1:33:48] oh what's everyone doing no lord jesus
[1:33:50] what are you doing
[1:33:52] what are you doing today lord how's 2022
[1:33:55] working out for you
[1:33:56] how do you feel about this how how do
[1:33:58] you feel about me i'm going to tell you
[1:34:00] how i feel about you
[1:34:02] and then you find yourself so lost and
[1:34:03] praising him amen oh i got no time to
[1:34:06] spread a whole bunch of poison
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] but we need
[1:34:13] we need
[1:34:14] a new spirit
[1:34:17] right
[1:34:18] so and we don't want to have what the
[1:34:20] what the prophet said
[1:34:22] can't yo
[1:34:24] missed meal cramps
[1:34:26] like he said about the manner falling in
[1:34:28] the wilderness it would fall
[1:34:30] and then they would eat a bit then it
[1:34:32] would go old they had to get new manner
[1:34:34] all the time
[1:34:35] but that same manner and the holy of
[1:34:37] holies never went old
[1:34:38] it never got old it was there
[1:34:41] and the high priest went in they took a
[1:34:43] mouthful of manor
[1:34:45] and then the next high priesthood so the
[1:34:47] same manner on the outside went old and
[1:34:49] stale but the one in the holy of holies
[1:34:51] and the prince of god never went old
[1:34:53] that's the same thing with the believer
[1:34:55] we can have times when the manna falls
[1:34:56] and we just fill our spiritual bellies
[1:34:58] and we shout and rejoice i mean but if
[1:35:00] we are not living in the holy of holies
[1:35:02] where the lord jesus on the inside of us
[1:35:04] then that experience gets old the word
[1:35:06] gets old it gets stale
[1:35:09] right but if you're in the holy of
[1:35:10] holies that would don't get old it
[1:35:12] doesn't get stale it can't get moldy
[1:35:14] because you're living in the presence of
[1:35:16] the king
[1:35:17] oh there brother sister i'm not giving
[1:35:19] you pie in the sky this is reality you
[1:35:21] can live in the prison of god every day
[1:35:23] of your life i mean not because you're
[1:35:25] up some hills top in the wilderness
[1:35:28] somewhere you can be you'll be walking
[1:35:30] down amen
[1:35:32] middle of wellington
[1:35:33] hell can be around you literally you can
[1:35:35] be i'm so glad i can see i'm one of them
[1:35:38] hallelujah and you don't have some
[1:35:40] judgmental spirit against everyone
[1:35:41] you've got a heart full of love
[1:35:43] lord somehow touch that person touch
[1:35:45] that person lord
[1:35:47] speak to him speak to her lord bring
[1:35:49] them bring them to yourself may they
[1:35:50] fall in love with you somehow
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:53] hallelujah
[1:35:55] amen
[1:35:58] amen so they jump down after a little
[1:35:59] while and they bounce bounce bounce back
[1:36:01] again they never receive the holy ghost
[1:36:03] no matter how much they bounce how much
[1:36:05] they screamed uh uh had oil run out of
[1:36:08] their hands and and they have bloody
[1:36:09] faces and how much they spoke in tongues
[1:36:11] how much they shouted what they did that
[1:36:13] has nothing at all to do with it that's
[1:36:15] only human emotions they got a new
[1:36:17] spirit and they rejoice with it
[1:36:20] now i'm all for shouting screaming
[1:36:22] acts 238 youngans that's the only kind
[1:36:24] the word can produce snot and crying
[1:36:27] howling not a dried confession
[1:36:30] not a mental ascent of i believe the
[1:36:32] mess no no you really meet him
[1:36:34] right but what happens after that
[1:36:36] happens
[1:36:37] right because many people they just get
[1:36:38] a new spirit what's happening they can
[1:36:40] start to live with their family they can
[1:36:41] live with their neighbor they're not
[1:36:43] fussing anymore they're not fighting i
[1:36:44] mean they're they're not in drugs and
[1:36:46] alcohol and you know things of the world
[1:36:48] that's taken from them but that's just a
[1:36:50] new spirit
[1:36:52] that's in a tremendous work
[1:36:54] but don't stay there
[1:36:56] don't stay just with a new spirit
[1:36:58] because that's the great mistake people
[1:36:59] make
[1:37:01] god does an incredible work but have
[1:37:02] they been sealed in
[1:37:05] right
[1:37:07] brother m says you know why with the
[1:37:09] spirit you had
[1:37:10] you couldn't even get along with
[1:37:12] yourself so how are you going to get
[1:37:13] along with god
[1:37:15] god has to do a renovation he's going to
[1:37:17] take the holy ghost his big bulldozer
[1:37:19] down your tin can alleys i mean just
[1:37:21] bust the whole thing out amen then god
[1:37:23] terraces it out puts a big mansion on
[1:37:25] there and then he lives on the inside of
[1:37:27] a new hallelujah i mean so yes so if we
[1:37:30] couldn't get along with ourselves that's
[1:37:32] why there's so many troubled people in
[1:37:34] the world that can't get along with
[1:37:35] themselves what do they need a new
[1:37:37] spirit
[1:37:38] but not just a new spirit they need god
[1:37:40] to come and dwell on the inside of that
[1:37:42] new spirit
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] so god had to give you a new heart not a
[1:37:48] patched up one a new heart that's your
[1:37:49] intellects what you think with a new way
[1:37:52] of thinking
[1:37:53] what is that new way of thinking the
[1:37:54] word is true
[1:37:57] jesus is alive that's a new way of
[1:37:59] thinking
[1:38:01] but that's just your first step
[1:38:03] it's a great step but don't stay on the
[1:38:05] first step
[1:38:07] amen he says then i'll give you a new
[1:38:09] spirit what's that and you desire i want
[1:38:11] to do right
[1:38:13] i want to do right so we want to go
[1:38:16] beyond that
[1:38:18] because i'm sure i'm looking at a whole
[1:38:21] building of people they want to do right
[1:38:24] who wants to do wrong
[1:38:26] hey
[1:38:30] i had to do it sorry
[1:38:33] but everyone here wants to do rydee
[1:38:36] everyone everyone wants it lord i want
[1:38:37] to live a life pleasing to you
[1:38:40] but the thing is don't just stay there
[1:38:43] that's a work of god we don't despise
[1:38:45] that we all need it
[1:38:46] but don't just come that far because
[1:38:48] some people yo they get such a great a
[1:38:50] radical change they get such a new
[1:38:51] spirit they think oh i've got the holy
[1:38:53] ghost now
[1:38:55] not
[1:38:56] yet not yet
[1:39:00] now he says with that old spirit i just
[1:39:02] want to labor this because in that
[1:39:03] condition
[1:39:04] you can you can't get along with your
[1:39:06] wife you can't get along with your
[1:39:08] husband you can't get along with your
[1:39:10] neighbor how are you ever going to get
[1:39:12] along with god so he has to give you a
[1:39:14] new spirit before you can get along with
[1:39:16] him
[1:39:17] i mean so he puts a new spirit in you
[1:39:20] and then he puts his spirit in you gives
[1:39:22] you a new spirit a new outlook a new
[1:39:25] faith then he puts his holy spirit in
[1:39:28] you
[1:39:29] amen
[1:39:31] this is so and then he says here and and
[1:39:34] what does it take to make a christian
[1:39:36] life he says and when the devil comes
[1:39:38] back what does he find he finds his old
[1:39:41] tin can hell is when the spirit is cast
[1:39:43] out of a person
[1:39:44] right but there's been no change on the
[1:39:46] inside that spirit will come back and
[1:39:48] find that same old tin can alley the
[1:39:50] same old desires the same old things you
[1:39:53] know the same old strongholds of all
[1:39:55] your i've got to have this i got to be
[1:39:56] like this person things are hollywood
[1:39:58] whatever more things of the world i may
[1:40:00] be speaking rather general but there's
[1:40:02] all those old things that haven't been
[1:40:03] taken away right god sent his big
[1:40:05] bulldozer down and cut the thing all to
[1:40:07] pieces and bulldoze it up and scraped it
[1:40:10] off and a hallelujah avenue is built
[1:40:12] there it ain't the same place there's a
[1:40:14] big modern home built with the holy
[1:40:16] spirit is brooded big beautiful flowers
[1:40:18] of salvation standing up you don't even
[1:40:20] have to try and impersonate anything
[1:40:22] this is when the holy ghost comes in
[1:40:24] right it's a new heart it's a new
[1:40:25] dwelling place it's a new spirit
[1:40:27] everything is new how can the devil walk
[1:40:30] back there and expect the old card table
[1:40:33] and the cigars and the old fussing
[1:40:36] fighting stewing everything
[1:40:38] that you had in you that's why i wanted
[1:40:40] to read this again right so
[1:40:43] that's all gone
[1:40:45] we shouldn't be a bunch of fusses
[1:40:48] we shouldn't be a bunch of stewers
[1:40:50] right that should be all gone
[1:40:53] amen amen why because blessed are the
[1:40:56] peacemakers
[1:40:57] amen
[1:41:01] amen the holy spirit turns over the old
[1:41:03] tin can alley dumps you upside down
[1:41:06] sweeps the devil stuff out of there
[1:41:08] creates a new heart and a new life not
[1:41:10] only that but he moves in to see that
[1:41:12] everything goes all right glory to god
[1:41:14] he has the caretakers the angels that
[1:41:16] prune the trees oh my he says i wish i
[1:41:18] was twice my size think about what he
[1:41:20] does brother sister amen
[1:41:22] buddy so he doesn't just give us a new
[1:41:24] spirit don't stop there
[1:41:26] but go in and receive the holy ghost
[1:41:28] that he becomes the wheel within the
[1:41:30] middle of the wheel i mean he comes in
[1:41:33] and takes over you can do a lot with
[1:41:34] that new spirit
[1:41:36] right but you cannot live the word
[1:41:39] you cannot live the word amen
[1:41:42] and it stand in time of trouble and test
[1:41:45] because when things are going well god
[1:41:46] bless you brother god bless you sister
[1:41:48] but then when trials come disagreement
[1:41:51] comes you'd say when the yeah it's like
[1:41:53] a cat's fur they love to be petted a
[1:41:55] certain way but if you if you scratch
[1:41:57] them the wrong way
[1:42:00] you know
[1:42:01] and it's like it's like anyone
[1:42:05] you can play the part
[1:42:06] but what happens when opposition comes
[1:42:09] what is really within you comes out
[1:42:12] like you can take the greatest mansion
[1:42:14] on the face of the earth and from the
[1:42:15] street side you could be uh you know
[1:42:18] isn't this a wonderful place and the
[1:42:20] people
[1:42:21] but then the inhabitants of that place
[1:42:23] because a beautiful nice big mansion is
[1:42:25] like a believer that looks the part
[1:42:27] they look like their holiness unto the
[1:42:29] lord on the outside but then if you open
[1:42:31] that front door and a bunch of
[1:42:34] crazy gangsters come out with guns and
[1:42:36] they want to do evil stuff and you know
[1:42:38] that's the inhabitants of the house
[1:42:41] and the only way you know who's in that
[1:42:43] house is when you actually kind of
[1:42:44] rattle the door
[1:42:46] when trouble comes or
[1:42:48] miss you know disagreements whatever
[1:42:50] comes it really shows what's within us
[1:42:53] amen is it revenge that comes out
[1:42:56] is it fussing is it grudges that come
[1:42:58] out is it unforgiveness is it
[1:43:00] stubbornness that comes out is it i'd no
[1:43:03] i'm just not going to listen to no i'm
[1:43:05] right no no you're a liar and blah blah
[1:43:07] you know someone just stands here like a
[1:43:08] mule they won't they want
[1:43:11] they're not flexible
[1:43:13] that's an old spirit still there
[1:43:16] the outside can look good
[1:43:18] but even you know we have to have a new
[1:43:20] spirit
[1:43:22] but it's more than that that the lord
[1:43:24] drives out all the gangsters and all the
[1:43:26] bad stuff
[1:43:27] he has to come in
[1:43:29] that when he comes in it's not just a
[1:43:31] facade of a believer
[1:43:34] but then divine love comes out
[1:43:36] meekness comes out
[1:43:38] gentleness comes out
[1:43:40] faith comes out
[1:43:42] understanding comes out

[1:44:07] thing
[1:44:08] but yet not have the holy ghost
[1:44:12] we must be born again
[1:44:15] if your old nature rises up and you

[1:44:19] am there's a temper you can't you need a
[1:44:22] new spirit and you need him to come and

[1:44:56] and then he makes your every your main
[1:44:59] motion every intellectual
[1:45:01] everything agreeing right into this
[1:45:03] middle of the wheel which is the word

[1:45:09] if the days of miracles of jesus christ
[1:45:11] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:45:13] holy spirit would bear record with that
[1:45:15] and every intellectual move of yours
[1:45:17] will say the same thing so in your heart
[1:45:19] you'll say amen to every promise
[1:45:22] if the word says you've got to stop
[1:45:23] doing certain things you'll say amen
[1:45:26] hallelujah if you start if you're
[1:45:27] mistreating your family you'll say lord
[1:45:29] forgive me and change me because the
[1:45:31] wheel within the middle of the wheel
[1:45:33] will cause you to line up with the word
[1:45:35] it's not you trying to line up yourself
[1:45:36] with just a new spirit but his spirit
[1:45:39] comes in and begins to live his word out
[1:45:41] of you and i
[1:45:42] amen amen hallelujah

[1:45:51] this to sink real deep
[1:45:53] right
[1:45:54] now if the days of okay so and when you
[1:45:57] have these little temper fits
[1:45:59] and you fly out you tell lies and you
[1:46:01] proselyte you jump the fences and you're
[1:46:03] so selfish with your organization now i
[1:46:06] talk about
[1:46:08] that you're so narrow-minded that you
[1:46:10] wouldn't hear another minister just
[1:46:12] remember the holy spirit isn't ticking
[1:46:14] on the inside of you few i didn't know i
[1:46:16] was going to say that but that's right
[1:46:17] see so we can look all apart but if we
[1:46:19] fly off and temper fits you know
[1:46:22] you say i'm just having a bad day the
[1:46:24] holy ghost is greater than a bad day
[1:46:26] i'm having trouble in my home the holy
[1:46:28] ghost is greater than that trouble if
[1:46:29] he's in you he'll take control of it but
[1:46:31] he's going to take control of you first
[1:46:34] amen
[1:46:38] we don't have the holy ghost if we're
[1:46:40] all that way the holy spirit will make
[1:46:42] every movement like christ it'll make
[1:46:44] you christ like the fruits of the spirit
[1:46:46] is love
[1:46:47] joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:46:49] meekness gentleness patience faith those
[1:46:52] things are what the holy spirit controls
[1:46:55] our emotions
[1:46:57] our emotions is not so much as jumping
[1:46:59] up and down you could do that a shindig
[1:47:02] will bring it to you but the holy spirit
[1:47:04] brings you into operation or in control
[1:47:07] amen of god that you walk in peace and
[1:47:09] in love and enjoy with long suffering
[1:47:11] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:47:14] you see it isn't something that you do
[1:47:16] it's something that the holy ghost does
[1:47:18] in you
[1:47:19] so it's not you saying i i should be
[1:47:21] long suffering here
[1:47:23] remember i'm going to be long stuff no
[1:47:24] you are long suffering
[1:47:26] with a new spirit you got to remind
[1:47:27] yourself i should be meek yes you know i
[1:47:29] should i should be gentle and you know i
[1:47:31] should be long suffering and this is
[1:47:33] what but when he comes in then he just
[1:47:36] lives it out of you
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] remember
[1:47:43] there's no complex that can stop god
[1:47:46] so don't reason away saying i can never
[1:47:48] bear all the fruits of the spirit
[1:47:50] because x y and z my mother was like
[1:47:52] this my father's like this well this is
[1:47:54] what's going on in my home and this has
[1:47:56] got to be this way my childhood was like
[1:47:57] this no god is greater than all those
[1:48:00] things
[1:48:01] so don't ever reason away and say i can
[1:48:03] never have that because of my past
[1:48:06] i think god is greater than your past
[1:48:09] he's greater than my past he's greater
[1:48:11] than my present
[1:48:13] hallelujah so never ever reason these
[1:48:15] things away
[1:48:17] amen it's something the holy ghost does
[1:48:19] and you see it's no longer an
[1:48:20] intellectual thought of your own it's a
[1:48:22] subconscious moving of the holy spirit
[1:48:24] oh i wish i could shout the praise of
[1:48:26] god around the world to that i mean it's
[1:48:28] a subconscious thing it's god working on
[1:48:30] the inside sorry i'm taking too much
[1:48:32] time but you know it's god working on
[1:48:34] the inside it's not you trying to do it
[1:48:36] it's a subconscious thing
[1:48:38] amy says church of the living god
[1:48:42] that's where our pentecostal move has
[1:48:43] failed i say i could even say this don't
[1:48:45] stone me this is where the message
[1:48:47] has failed
[1:48:49] people have just got a new spirit
[1:48:50] without receiving the holy ghost
[1:48:52] preachers deacons and all not just you
[1:48:54] know musicians song leaders whatever
[1:48:56] they come up to this father they never
[1:48:58] receive the holy ghost we have some
[1:49:00] man-made musical clap hands jump up and
[1:49:02] down a motion when if we go back out on
[1:49:05] the street and the holy spirit doesn't
[1:49:07] govern our lives to cooperate with that
[1:49:09] we do not have the holy spirit so we
[1:49:12] can't act one way in church or one way
[1:49:15] around believers in another way in the
[1:49:16] world
[1:49:17] we should be the same person we
[1:49:19] shouldn't have split personalities we're
[1:49:21] not schizophrenic
[1:49:23] well i'm this way at work because that's
[1:49:25] the conditions of working on this way in
[1:49:27] the mall because that's how the mall is
[1:49:28] on this way at the beach because there's
[1:49:29] other beaches and and i'm this way at
[1:49:31] home because this is how my home is no
[1:49:33] we do not change how we act based on the
[1:49:35] environment we're in
[1:49:37] jesus was the same
[1:49:39] amen in jericho that he was in jerusalem
[1:49:41] that he was in the wilderness that he
[1:49:42] was on galilee he was the same and the
[1:49:45] apostle paul was the same there in the
[1:49:47] holy land that he was in greece he was
[1:49:48] in macedonia wherever he went he was the
[1:49:50] same he's the same in the prison same in
[1:49:53] the ship i mean same with his head's
[1:49:54] about to be cut off he was the same
[1:49:56] apostle paul
[1:49:58] because the lord was living with him so
[1:50:00] we should be the same person
[1:50:02] i trust if you visit me at work
[1:50:04] who i am here is the same one there
[1:50:07] in my nature how i talk to people
[1:50:09] whatever i should be the same person
[1:50:11] amen who wants to be like that now i'm
[1:50:13] not tricking you here who wants to be
[1:50:15] like that
[1:50:16] amen he says that's not skim milk
[1:50:19] brother but that's what the church needs
[1:50:20] only life can come by the holy spirit
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:25] now i'm just going to read this and then
[1:50:27] i am going to close
[1:50:28] okay when this takes place now this is
[1:50:31] from is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:50:34] very good message i listened to it this
[1:50:35] week
[1:50:37] but without he says but when this takes
[1:50:39] place the thing you'll do then you'll
[1:50:40] find out that the whole that the spirit
[1:50:43] that comes in you from the new birth you
[1:50:44] will be believing and doing everything
[1:50:46] that god says in his word is for you to
[1:50:49] do and everything that the bible quotes
[1:50:51] for you to do you'll punctuate it with
[1:50:52] an amen
[1:50:54] and you'll not stop day and night till
[1:50:56] you receive it
[1:50:57] that's right that's right and in all
[1:50:59] this time you'll certainly above
[1:51:01] everything bear the fruit of the spirit
[1:51:03] some people have taken it i receiving
[1:51:05] the message is the evidence of the holy
[1:51:07] ghost
[1:51:08] what is the manifestation of receiving
[1:51:09] the word you will bear the fruit of the
[1:51:11] spirit
[1:51:12] your life will be an amen to the word
[1:51:15] amen
[1:51:16] amen
[1:51:17] you might say well i speak in tongues
[1:51:19] you might do that you might not will i
[1:51:21] shout you might do that you might not
[1:51:23] but there is one sure thing you'll do
[1:51:25] you'll bear the fruit of the spirit and
[1:51:26] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:51:28] peace faith long suffering meekness
[1:51:30] gentleness patience your temple will not
[1:51:32] be oh
[1:51:33] just remember when you got that that
[1:51:36] poisons the holy spirit away from you
[1:51:37] see
[1:51:38] i mean when you get to a place where you
[1:51:40] want to fuss with everybody you come
[1:51:42] along to there's something wrong when
[1:51:44] you get to a place where the minister
[1:51:45] will read from the bible that if it's um
[1:51:48] that it's wrong to do a certain thing
[1:51:50] amen and you'll just remember there's no
[1:51:52] christian there uh christianity in there
[1:51:54] at all if you can't toe up with it
[1:51:56] that's now by their fruits you shall
[1:51:57] know them that's what jesus said see if
[1:52:00] it's the word and god said so that the
[1:52:02] spirit in you will cope with that word
[1:52:04] every time because genuine holy spirit
[1:52:06] will cope with the word because the word
[1:52:08] is life and spirit jesus said my my
[1:52:10] words are life and if you've got eternal
[1:52:12] life and here's the word how can the
[1:52:14] word deny the word see what kind of a
[1:52:17] person would you make god there's one
[1:52:19] thing to know that you're a christian
[1:52:21] when you fully agree upon every word of
[1:52:23] god
[1:52:24] amen and you find yourself in love with
[1:52:27] your enemies

[1:52:31] a holy roller and you start to get all
[1:52:33] riled up be careful uh-huh be careful

[1:52:41] love them see
[1:52:42] then you beginning to find and your
[1:52:45] patience gets from about that long so
