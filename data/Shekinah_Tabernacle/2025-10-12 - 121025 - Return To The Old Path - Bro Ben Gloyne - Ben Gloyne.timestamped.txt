[4:32] [Music]
[5:09] Good morning.
[5:11] How are you all today? Doing well.
[5:15] I was really enjoying the sound of the
[5:18] instruments playing. I really like the
[5:20] sound of the violin. Do you like the
[5:22] sound of a violin? It's like got this
[5:24] kind of like
[5:26] like it's not happy, but it's not sad.
[5:28] It's kind of like a deep sound.
[5:31] often marvel at music, you know, because
[5:33] I guess when the Lord made man, he
[5:35] didn't give them any music. They just
[5:36] turned up. And then over time, we've
[5:39] kind of figured out this thing called
[5:41] music and these different sounds and
[5:42] these random things that we do. We get
[5:44] this piece of wood and we pull a tight
[5:46] string over it and we start like
[5:50] we get this funny little thing. Hold
[5:52] your bow up that what do you call that?
[5:54] A bow. Isn't that a weird thing to call
[5:56] it? A bow. But it, you know, it makes
[5:58] this sound and then we pull these metal
[6:01] strings tight and they do this and then
[6:03] we clang things and this guy over here
[6:06] bashes on things and you know but it all
[6:09] if you get it right it makes this sound
[6:11] you know there's we I love people humans
[6:14] we just we we've created the Lord must
[6:16] enjoy it when we create these things and
[6:18] we just we we we end up with this thing
[6:21] called music and it's nice to be able to
[6:22] worship the Lord um through through
[6:25] music. I also like the bag pipes. Who
[6:28] likes the bag pipes?
[6:30] Do you know what I love about the bag
[6:32] pipes?
[6:33] I like things that uh not not so much
[6:36] aggressive, but I like things that that
[6:38] are bold, you know, just that push out.
[6:41] Some instruments, they just sort of turn
[6:42] up in the mix. You don't know that
[6:43] they're there. You know, they could not
[6:44] play and you're like, "Oh, I didn't
[6:45] realize he wasn't even playing or she
[6:47] wasn't playing." You know, cuz they just
[6:48] they're like a little nothing
[6:49] instrument. But a bag pipe, it's either
[6:52] there or it's not there. like when it
[6:54] turns up, it's there and it takes over
[6:56] the whole show. It's like, wow, the bag
[6:58] pipes are started, you know, and then
[7:02] I like that about the bag pipes, you
[7:03] know, there, you know, when they turn
[7:05] up. They're not just like this little
[7:06] side instrument. Let's um stand this
[7:08] morning. We'll just open up in a word of
[7:10] prayer.
[7:12] We spare a thought for little Davey,
[7:14] too. He's um little Davey. He there.
[7:18] Brother Taz has uh like he's doing a
[7:21] it's like a youth sort of outreach type
[7:22] thing service or I don't know a lot
[7:25] about it but I know Dave and a few other
[7:27] guys have gone up to sort of share their
[7:28] testimonies and there's different ones
[7:30] there. Um I think I thought it was going
[7:33] to be quite small but there's maybe 60
[7:35] or so people there and poor little Dave
[7:36] is quite nervous. He's bringing gave me
[7:38] a few phone calls this morning as he's
[7:40] he's first up. But um I'm glad that
[7:42] we've
[7:44] like here we've had the little youth
[7:45] services and things that you know that
[7:48] we've given these young people a chance
[7:50] to come up and do it here and not get so
[7:53] nervous you know because um it takes a
[7:56] lot believe it or not it takes courage
[7:58] to go to stand up and to do that. Like
[8:00] even to stand up here you don't think it
[8:02] but I'm every time I sit there before I
[8:03] come up I'm so nervous. I'm like oh I'm
[8:05] nervous and I think I should go up now.
[8:07] No, wait. No, go up. It's when you get
[8:09] up, you're all right. But it's I'm
[8:10] always nervous. And I've done this a
[8:12] million times, you know, and I think,
[8:13] man, this poor little guy. He's got
[8:14] these people he doesn't know from a bar
[8:16] of soap and he's got to get up there and
[8:17] they're all like hanging on every word
[8:18] he says. I'm like, it's quite
[8:19] nerve-wracking. It takes courage.
[8:22] And and I like a man or a woman with
[8:25] courage, you know, that stand up and do
[8:27] it. You know, even if you think I could
[8:28] mess this all up, it doesn't matter. I'm
[8:30] going to stand up and have courage and
[8:31] do it anyway. So let's um let's pray
[8:33] this morning and yeah just commit the
[8:36] service to you to the Lord. Lord we
[8:37] thank you Lord for this opportunity that
[8:39] we can have courage this morning and
[8:41] stand up and serve you and worship you
[8:42] and sing to you Lord and I pray you'll
[8:44] bless our song service this morning.

[8:49] way. Thank you Lord for the

[8:55] you've made man in the different things
[8:56] that we come up with to worship and to
[8:59] praise. We make these sounds, Lord. But
[9:01] the the greatest thing that we have is
[9:03] our heart inside our heart. And this
[9:04] desire that we have to worship, to want
[9:06] to worship and praise you. That's the
[9:08] that's the greatest instrument. That's
[9:09] the greatest sound. That's the greatest
[9:11] expression of all, Lord, is a is
[9:13] worshiping you from a pure heart, Lord.
[9:15] That's the greatest thing that we have.
[9:16] And I I thank you for each heart here

[9:19] we've chosen to worship you this
[9:22] morning, Lord. And we just pray that
[9:23] that you'd just accept the worship of
[9:25] our heart this morning, Lord. But may it
[9:27] be without guile or without any any
[9:30] pretense. May it just be pure before
[9:32] you, Lord Jesus. I pray you bless this
[9:34] uh brother Taz in the service there that
[9:36] they're doing as well. And the different

[40:16] your life. Amen. Glory to God. Thank
[40:18] you, Isaac. Amen. Thank you, brother
[40:20] Isaac. Thank you, musicians. Amen. I

[40:26] this self-help nonsense today, let him
[40:28] be your help and your strength and
[40:29] change you. Amen. Our God is in the
[40:32] business of transforming people,
[40:33] changing lives, filling with the Holy
[40:35] Ghost, healing, raising the dead,
[40:37] casting out devils. Amen. Our God is
[40:39] here to give you peace. Amen. That pass
[40:41] all understanding. Praise the Lord. I'm
[40:44] so thankful we don't serve some weak
[40:45] God, some religion somewhere. We serve
[40:47] the Almighty. Amen. He's not just a
[40:50] mighty God. He's the Almighty. Amen.
[40:52] There's none beside him. Amen. There's
[40:54] none like him. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's
[40:56] um let's uh go to the scripture this
[40:58] morning. We're going to go to Jeremiah
[41:00] uh chapter 6 and uh verse verse 13. And
[41:04] we're just going to read a couple of
[41:05] scriptures here. Then we're going to go
[41:06] to um uh we're going to go to John. Oh,
[41:10] let's just read this then you can well
[41:12] then we'll go to John chapter 8. But
[41:13] let's read here Jeremiah 6 and 13 to to
[41:16] 16. Sure. Good to see everyone here
[41:18] today. Hey, the wind is blowing outside.
[41:20] Let's pray. The the supernatural wind of
[41:23] the Holy Ghost will move and just not
[41:26] just move upon us, come into us.
[41:27] Inspiration something that comes in.
[41:29] Amen. That come out as we go out through
[41:31] the week and God's inspiration can live
[41:33] out of our lives. And amen. So wind of
[41:35] the Holy Spirit blow Lord. Amen. That's
[41:37] my prayer. Amen. Jeremiah 6:13 says um
[41:40] from uh for from the least of them even
[41:43] unto the greatest of them everyone is
[41:45] given to covetousness and from the
[41:48] prophet even unto the priest everyone
[41:50] deleth falsely. They have healed also
[41:52] the hurt of the daughter of my people
[41:55] slightly saying peace peace where there
[41:57] is no peace. Where they um were they
[42:00] ashamed when they had had committed
[42:03] abomination. Nay, they were not at all
[42:05] ashamed, neither could they blush.
[42:07] Therefore, they shall fall among them
[42:09] that fall at the time that I visit them.
[42:11] They shall be cast down, sayeth the
[42:13] Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord, stand ye in
[42:15] the ways and see and ask for the old
[42:17] paths. Where is the good way and walk
[42:19] therein, and ye shall find rest for your
[42:21] souls, but they say, we will not walk
[42:24] therein. I'm glad we're not in that
[42:26] category. We want to walk in that path.
[42:29] Amen. Then, um, just a couple of verses
[42:31] from John chapter 8. You don't need to
[42:33] turn to it if well you can if you want
[42:34] to, but I'm just going to uh read it
[42:36] here. He says, "Then said Jesus to those
[42:38] Jews which believed on him, if ye
[42:40] continue in my word, then you are my
[42:42] disciples indeed, and ye shall know the
[42:45] truth, and the truth shall make you
[42:47] free."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Let's um let's just go
[42:51] to the Lord in prayer. Um we have one
[42:53] prayer request from from uh South
[42:55] Africa. It's from uh Brother Tashius,
[42:58] Sister Mary, is that how you say,
[42:59] Brother Armand. Um so they have a um so
[43:02] sister Mary's pregnant with a son and
[43:04] the doctors the specialists have have um
[43:06] had a look and and and the and the baby
[43:08] has if I I don't know if I can say this
[43:10] right but a congenital diaphragmatic
[43:13] hernia. So basically the intestines as
[43:16] well as the stomach have pushed through
[43:17] this hernia into the chest cavity which
[43:19] is affecting the growth of the left lung
[43:21] and um and and and has been pushed far
[43:24] to the right which is along with the
[43:25] heart. So, this baby's got great trouble
[43:28] uh with development because of this
[43:30] hernia. And the doctors are saying that
[43:32] this baby only has a 15% chance of life
[43:34] after birth. Okay. So, this is a great
[43:37] this is a great need. They've asked the
[43:39] bride around the world to to to remember
[43:41] them in prayer. And so, I think we let's
[43:43] just join our faith together cuz we're
[43:45] fearfully and wonderfully made. And God
[43:48] is more than able to to to reach into a
[43:50] womb, touch a life, put everything back
[43:53] together, take the hernia away, move
[43:55] everything. healthy, well, and strong.
[43:56] There's nothing too hard for the Lord.
[43:58] We've heard of cases among believers
[44:00] where there's a down syndrome or some
[44:02] great defect in the baby, and you know,
[44:04] they should the parents are told to
[44:06] terminate the pregnancy. Of course, they
[44:07] did not, and the baby's born healthy,
[44:09] strong, and well. So, our God's still in
[44:11] the business of transformation, healing,
[44:13] rearranging things. So, there's nothing
[44:15] our God cannot do. Amen. So, if you have
[44:17] a need, you just want to raise your
[44:18] hands to the Lord as well. Let's
[44:19] remember, Amen. this couple uh and child
[44:22] and Amen. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we
[44:25] just sung there's nothing you cannot do.
[44:28] Hallelujah. There's nothing that Lord,
[44:29] you're bigger, better, stronger, greater
[44:31] than any enemy, any giant, any mountain.
[44:33] Lord, any insurmountable odds which seem
[44:35] impossible, Lord, that's where you step
[44:37] in and you do the impossible. Lord,
[44:39] you're the God of the impossible. And
[44:41] gracious Father, you see the doctors
[44:42] have only given this little baby 15%
[44:45] chance to Lord to live after he has been
[44:47] born because of this condition with this
[44:49] hernia and the organs moving and pushing
[44:51] and different things. But Lord, you're
[44:53] the almighty God. You're the great the
[44:55] great physician. Lord, you're not just a
[44:56] physician. You're the great one.
[44:58] Hallelujah. Lord, you do things
[44:59] perfectly, my God. So, Father, we lift
[45:01] we lift Sister Mary, Lord, and her
[45:03] husband, Lord, into your presence by
[45:05] prayer. We lift their son, oh God,
[45:06] that's in her womb. We ask, Lord, you
[45:08] touch her, my God. Touch him, Lord.
[45:10] Father, may you rearrange it, Lord.
[45:12] Bring the organs back to the right
[45:13] place, dear God. Bring order back to his
[45:15] life, Father. Lord, that when he's born,
[45:17] he's born healthy, strong, and well,
[45:19] Lord. We're believing for this cuz we've
[45:20] seen you do too much, Lord, to not
[45:22] believe, Lord. You're more than able to
[45:24] do it, Father. So, we claim this his
[45:26] healing is full restoration, dear God,
[45:28] for your glory, Lord. Any other needs
[45:29] among us, Lord. You know, there's many
[45:31] sick, Father, among us who couldn't be
[45:33] here today. Be their abundant portion.
[45:35] May the sickness cease now in the name
[45:37] of Jesus Christ. And Father, may you
[45:39] touch all of our lives, dear God. May
[45:40] this be such a real service, Lord. A
[45:42] supernatural moment, dear God. Father,
[45:44] may all of us leave this place changed,
[45:46] Lord, renewed, oh God. do what you want
[45:49] to do in our midst, Lord. We submit our
[45:50] lives into your hands. As we read your
[45:52] great eternal word, may you now step in
[45:54] and anoint it to our souls for your
[45:56] glory. In Jesus Christ's name, we ask
[45:58] these things. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[46:01] You can have your seats this morning.
[46:03] So, I want to speak about I've got you.
[46:05] Well, I want to speak about the old
[46:08] paths. It's the good one. Even the Bible
[46:11] says it's the good one. And this is a
[46:13] very good one because you shall find
[46:15] rest for your souls. Now, there's always
[46:17] a spirit, a religious spirit that wants
[46:19] to get us off that path, who wants us to
[46:21] take a take a substitute, but we're not
[46:24] here to to to have a substitute. I'm not
[46:26] interested in a fake copy. I want the
[46:28] real thing. I mean, I want the real
[46:30] thing. And I believe you're a people
[46:31] that want the real thing more than
[46:33] anything. Amen. So, so we want to look
[46:35] at this here where, you know, you know,
[46:37] they would Jeremiah would say about the
[46:39] people in that day. And to me, the the
[46:41] book of Jeremiah is so striking because
[46:43] such a parallel to this day because
[46:45] Jeremiah was he he saw the vision of
[46:47] Nebuchadnezzar coming down and
[46:48] scattering the children of Israel and
[46:50] judgment was coming upon Israel because
[46:52] of their idolatry. And to me, it's the
[46:54] same thing today where this world is not
[46:56] just going to be scattered, it's going
[46:57] to be destroyed. Amen. Because of
[46:59] idolatry and all these things. And
[47:01] there's but but a message has gone out
[47:03] before the destruction ever comes to
[47:05] come into this place of rest. Come into
[47:07] Christ. Come into a place of safety.
[47:09] Amen. That we don't need to see the
[47:10] great tribulation, but we can enjoy the
[47:12] wedding supper in the sky. Amen. So
[47:14] there is a there is an old path. It's a
[47:17] you know, ask for it. Seek the old path,
[47:18] you know, which is the good one, and
[47:21] walk therein, and you shall find rest
[47:23] for your soul. But you see, it's
[47:25] interesting in verse 14, it says that
[47:26] they have also um they have healed also
[47:29] the her daughter of my people slightly.
[47:31] So it's not even a complete healing.
[47:33] It's not like Jesus when Jesus heals
[47:35] someone, it's a complete work. Amen.
[47:37] when he when he you know when he um
[47:40] anyone he healed the blind man didn't
[47:42] stay he wasn't partially blind after
[47:44] Jesus touched him he was fully restored
[47:47] in sight you know so when God heals
[47:49] someone it's not a slight healing of
[47:50] just a patching up of a wound or just
[47:52] just just kind of rubbing a complex a
[47:55] certain way to pander to it or you know
[47:57] trying to just alleviate symptoms and
[47:59] just well these are seven steps that you
[48:01] can like a coping mechanism we don't
[48:03] have some coping mechanism this is not
[48:05] alcoholics anonymous where you just
[48:07] always alcoholic, but you're just kind
[48:09] of trying to manage these things. No.
[48:11] Whom the sun sets free is free indeed.
[48:14] Amen. It's not a partial trying to fix.
[48:16] No, this is a permanent fix. Amen. This
[48:19] is what the This is what the power of
[48:21] God does. Amen. It's not just trying to
[48:22] manage and keep your demons in check and
[48:25] all this kind of nonsense. No, they get
[48:27] cast out of you and you walk in liberty.
[48:29] You walk in freedom. Amen. Cuz God is
[48:31] here to free people. But you see it said
[48:33] they've only healed the daughter of the
[48:36] hurt of my daughter of my people
[48:37] slightly saying peace peace when there
[48:39] is no peace. So you'll be fine just you
[48:41] know you'll be okay and you there's
[48:43] peace and you'll be fine. No but there
[48:45] is no peace cuz the wound is not healed
[48:47] completely. But I'm here to announce to
[48:49] you that this message has got a power
[48:51] within it to heal any wound. Amen. And
[48:53] the full power of Calvary is here to
[48:55] manifest itself in our lives. That
[48:58] doesn't matter what wound that we're
[48:59] born with. Our upbringing may have
[49:01] wounded us. our distant parents or no
[49:03] parents or some parents or controlling
[49:05] parents or whatever whatever upbringing
[49:07] we were raised in. You know, God's here
[49:09] to heal those wounds. God's here to do a
[49:12] work in our lives so we don't have to
[49:14] live under those things and you know
[49:15] just a slight healing. No, there's
[49:17] complete healing.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the atonement today.
[49:21] Praise the Lord. So you shall if you if
[49:24] you continue in my word then you are my
[49:26] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[49:28] truth and the truth shall make you free.
[49:30] Now this word continue it means to stay
[49:34] as in in a given place a state a
[49:36] relation or an expectancy.
[49:39] So so this is how you continue in the
[49:41] word. You you remain in the word. Amen.
[49:43] But you've got a state of expectancy.
[49:46] What's the expectancy? God, you're more
[49:48] than able to fulfill what you've
[49:49] promised. Amen. You're a supernatural
[49:52] God. You're the same yesterday, today,
[49:54] and forever. You haven't changed one
[49:55] bit, Lord. Your word is here. what you
[49:57] wrote in your word that you said you'd
[49:59] do. You don't just say, "Well, I didn't
[50:01] really mean that or I've just, you know,
[50:02] embellished it." No. What he says, he
[50:04] does. I mean, what he promised, he does.
[50:07] Amen. He doesn't just give us a promise
[50:09] and let it hang over our lives and we
[50:11] never obtain to it. That's not our God.
[50:13] Our God freely gives us all things in
[50:15] Jesus Christ. Amen. And what he
[50:17] promised, he'll do it. When he said,
[50:19] "I'll never leave you nor forsake you."
[50:21] He's not saying it's a nice idea. He
[50:22] says, "My personal presence will be with
[50:25] you even in you to the end of the
[50:27] world." Amen. I'll be with you even in
[50:28] you to the end of the world. He promised
[50:30] that, did he not? Amen. He said, "If you
[50:32] seek me with all your heart, ye shall
[50:35] find me." Amen. That's a promise of the
[50:37] word. So if he gave that promise, he
[50:39] didn't say that if you seek me with all
[50:41] your heart, you might find me or
[50:43] potentially or there's an odds or a
[50:45] probability or he said, "Ye shall find
[50:47] me." Amen. So God is very determined
[50:50] that his word is going to manifest
[50:51] itself and what he has promised he will
[50:54] produce it.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If I get excited, well,
[50:58] I'm just going to get excited. Yeah, I'm
[51:00] sick of I'm sick of why why should we
[51:02] hold back?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; This is the greatest time to be alive.
[51:05] If there's anyone to be excited about
[51:07] anything, it's us. Amen. You know,
[51:09] because we have the greatest we have the
[51:10] answer to to the world's problems. Amen.
[51:13] Jesus Christ, the living God. Praise the
[51:16] Lord. But you see now there's a big
[51:18] problem where where this is going to be
[51:20] I'm going to try and tie these two
[51:21] thoughts together. But you see now
[51:23] there's always a spirit that tries to
[51:25] push us off the old paths that we don't
[51:27] find rest for our souls. Amen. And and
[51:30] um Paul would prophesy of this. He would
[51:32] speak about how there would come a great
[51:34] he said don't be shaken by word or
[51:36] spirit or lead or anything. No, but you
[51:39] you know the day of Christ is at hand.
[51:41] Let no man deceive you by any means, for
[51:42] that day they shall not come except
[51:44] there come a great falling away first
[51:46] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[51:49] of predition who opposeth and exaltth
[51:51] himself above all that's called God or
[51:53] that is worship so that he is God siteth
[51:56] in the temple of God showing himself
[51:58] that he is God. Now that son of
[52:00] predition, that antichrist spirit has
[52:01] been revealed in this day. I mean,
[52:03] that's what the seals, the opening of
[52:05] the seals reveals Christ, but also
[52:07] reveals the enemy, right? So, he's been
[52:09] revealed. We see him for what he is. But
[52:11] now this, but but what he always tries
[52:13] to do is he always tries to stop the
[52:15] church coming to its position. Amen. If
[52:18] there's always anything that's in your
[52:20] mind that tries to war against you, why
[52:22] does the devil come to you and say, "You
[52:23] think you're a son of God? You think
[52:25] you're going to overcome?" You know who
[52:27] has those negative thoughts come in your
[52:29] mind saying,
[52:30] "I'm not going to win.
[52:33] It's just not going to happen. I'm
[52:34] always going to live with this." Who
[52:36] gave you that thought? That's not the
[52:37] Lord. That's not his word. That's the
[52:40] enemy trying to put something, you know,
[52:41] put that thought to get you to agree
[52:43] with him to push you down to stop you
[52:45] stepping into your God-given position.
[52:48] Amen. And we can see the son of
[52:50] predition when when you say when he
[52:51] became a man in Judas's Scariot. Now,
[52:54] this is just a scene. I found this here.
[52:55] This is where before Jesus was about to
[52:58] go to Calvary, they had a supper there
[52:59] in um um Simon the leper's house in
[53:02] Bethany. And um well, let's just read
[53:04] the scripture here. And you know, and
[53:06] and then there came a woman having an
[53:08] alabaster box of very precious ointment
[53:11] and poured it on his head as he sat at
[53:13] meat. But but when his disciples saw it,
[53:15] they had indignation saying, "To what
[53:17] purpose is this waste?" Now you go to
[53:20] the book of John which is a prophetic
[53:22] gospel and and and John does not say the
[53:25] when the disciples saw it. He narrows it
[53:27] down to when Judas was the one who had
[53:29] indignation. Judas was the one who was
[53:32] displeased with this waste. And what
[53:34] happened is the son of predition I say
[53:36] his tentacles go very far. They reach
[53:39] very deep. They have a lot of great
[53:40] influence. So his attitude towards Mary
[53:43] was doing I mean caused the rest of the
[53:45] disciples to come under his influence
[53:47] and say what a waste. But here is now
[53:49] the bride, the church in that season was
[53:51] now anointing the word for what the word
[53:54] was about to achieve. Amen. And and and
[53:56] Judas, the son of predition, he did not
[53:59] want the word to achieve what it was
[54:01] meant to achieve. I trust you're
[54:02] following me this morning because this
[54:04] word the word has come in this day to
[54:06] produce a people made in the image of
[54:08] the word. I mean make a bride in the
[54:10] image of Jesus Christ. That's what the
[54:12] message has come to do. to produce a
[54:14] people that when you see those people,
[54:16] you look at the you see the acts of God.
[54:19] When you read the Bible, you see their
[54:20] character, that character living out of
[54:22] them. Amen. You see the Bible in flesh,
[54:25] right? But now but now the enemy does
[54:28] not want us to come to that position.
[54:29] You see, so what happened was is is as
[54:32] Judas would um you know, they all were
[54:34] filled with indignation. It came from
[54:36] Judas if you read the account in John's
[54:38] gospel. But then now you look for this.
[54:40] He says, he says, then then when Jesus
[54:42] understood it. So at first he just felt
[54:45] the anointing oil. He didn't say
[54:47] anything and then there's all this going
[54:49] on and then he understood, no, she's
[54:51] anointed me for what I'm about to do.
[54:54] She's anointed me for the next part of
[54:56] my ministry, which was his which was his
[54:58] his bear, his death, death, burial,
[55:01] resurrection. Right? That was the next
[55:02] part. So her worship, she was worshiping
[55:05] the word, giving praise to the word for
[55:07] what it was about to achieve. Not for
[55:10] what it had done, for what it was about
[55:11] to do. And we're going to be very aware
[55:13] and careful what we praise God for is
[55:15] what. Sure, we praise him for what he's
[55:17] done.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; But we're going to look forward. What is
[55:19] he going to achieve? Cuz you got to look
[55:21] at his achievement should be our goal.
[55:24] Amen. His achievement. What he wants to
[55:25] do are people going in the rapture. That
[55:27] should be what we're focusing upon.
[55:29] Amen. Because if your focus is rapture,
[55:31] then you have a burden for your family.
[55:33] You have a burden for your friends. You
[55:34] have a burden for your colleagues cuz
[55:36] you want them. I mean, like even William
[55:38] said this week, we got to warn people. A
[55:40] 5-year-old saying this, we're going to
[55:42] warn people. There's a better there's a
[55:43] way of escape out of this place. Not to
[55:46] put fear in people, for them to wake up
[55:48] and actually come to their senses. And
[55:49] hey, there's a World War II is coming.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Great tribulation's coming, but there's
[55:55] a way out.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so people who are focused on
[55:58] the rapture, it comes down to your
[56:00] everyday life. Lord, I want to be the
[56:01] best Christian I can be. Lord, I want to
[56:03] see you live. I want to be friendly to
[56:05] everyone. I mean, I want to be if people
[56:08] get nothing, they say, "Well, that
[56:09] person's nice."
[56:11] Not some big some some pious frown and
[56:14] all this kind of. No, turn the frown
[56:16] upside down. Give your face a rest.
[56:18] Takes more muscles to frown than to
[56:19] smile. Do you know that?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, stop using all your energy on
[56:23] that. Just why don't you just be happy,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; be friendly.
[56:27] A friend must show themselves friendly.
[56:30] It's a scriptural principle.
[56:32] Okay? So, we should have a burden and
[56:36] and and I'm not saying you do not, but
[56:38] that should be our focus. Lord, what are
[56:40] you what are you doing next?
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Anoint the word for what he's doing
[56:45] next. Amen. But then before before the
[56:48] change of the body is there's a
[56:50] restoration of the church or the bride
[56:53] back to what she was at Pentecost. And
[56:56] brother Brandon's very strong about
[56:57] this. He says he says what the what the
[56:59] bride was at Pentecost is the standard.
[57:03] That's the standard of the church. I try
[57:05] don't don't pull back on me because I
[57:07] think when we throw out terms you think,
[57:08] well, you're just chasing after gifts.
[57:10] No. At Pentecost, God dwelt in his
[57:12] church. God was in every member of the
[57:15] bride and God was leading them. It
[57:17] wasn't organization and trying to learn
[57:19] some things. It was God living in his
[57:21] people. And God brought his people into
[57:23] their position in the body. That was
[57:25] what they had at Pentecost.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Are we all okay? Am I am I too noisy?
[57:29] Amen. No, this is this is the standard.
[57:32] He says here, he says, "Now we know
[57:34] exactly from the word which was recorded
[57:36] by the Holy Spirit, how the first
[57:37] original church was founded and how God
[57:40] manifested himself in her. The word
[57:42] can't change or be changed because the
[57:44] word is God." He says John 1:1, in the
[57:46] beginning was the word. The word was
[57:48] with God and the word was God. To change
[57:50] one word of it as did um as did Eve
[57:52] bring sin and death. Even as it says in
[57:54] Revelations 22, if the plagues that are
[57:57] written in this book, if any man shall
[57:58] take away from the words of the book of
[58:00] this prophecy, God shall take away from
[58:02] his part out of the book of life and out
[58:04] of the holy city and from the things
[58:05] which are written in this book. Thus,
[58:07] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[58:10] standard is the standard. That is the
[58:13] pattern. There's no other pattern. No
[58:14] matter what the scholars say, God has
[58:16] not changed that pattern. What God did
[58:18] at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing
[58:21] until the church ages close. We're still
[58:24] living. This world is still in Lady Oia.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; We have not left the church ages.
[58:28] Doesn't matter what some people try and
[58:30] say about we're still the world is in
[58:31] Lady Oia. We're still living. So what
[58:33] God did in the beginning, he's going to
[58:36] finish his church the same way. This is
[58:37] the standard. So if that's the standard,
[58:39] that's what we should be anointing the
[58:41] word for him to do. Is that okay?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Because we got to realize this is the
[58:46] standard. God, Christ in you, the hope
[58:48] of glory.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what the church had at
[58:51] Pentecost his is her inalienable right
[58:54] originally. She had the pure word of
[58:56] God. So, it's it's our right to have God
[58:59] move like he did in the book of Acts.
[59:01] It's our right. And people say, "Well,
[59:03] you just chasing you're just going back
[59:05] to a Pentecostal move." No. Pentecost of
[59:08] the book of Acts is different to the
[59:09] Pentecostal denomination because the
[59:12] Pentecostal denomination is just a
[59:13] restoration of the gifts, right? But
[59:15] Pentecost, the book of Acts, is God
[59:17] dwelling in his people. Amen. And if
[59:20] there's if there's gifts, praise God,
[59:22] they're part of the word. I don't have a
[59:23] twink pen to rub out anything in the
[59:26] scripture. I believe it all. Amen. And
[59:28] it's our inner inaliable right. So
[59:30] everything they had back then is our
[59:32] right today. Amen. Where we don't just
[59:35] join. You see this son of predition, the
[59:37] spirit wants to stop us having our
[59:39] inalienable right. Amen. But we're here
[59:41] for a fight, aren't we? We're taking all
[59:43] of our blessings. Amen. So every part of
[59:45] the word is ours. So we can't just simp
[59:47] back and say, well, you know, we can't
[59:50] just we we can't just pull back and say,
[59:53] well, we shouldn't do that because it
[59:55] because it makes some people unhappy or
[59:58] brings a jealousy or brings a
[59:59] resentment. I'm going to come into that
[1:00:01] soon. No, this is this is my promise
[1:00:03] that God would be in me and he'd live
[1:00:05] his life out of me and he'd be the
[1:00:07] Christian through me. Amen. That's what
[1:00:09] I want. That's what I want for my
[1:00:11] family. That's what I want for all of
[1:00:12] us. I never want us just to cabbage down
[1:00:15] into an intellectual idea and have a
[1:00:16] nice church.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Forget it. I don't You can find I'm not
[1:00:21] interested in a club or a lodge. I know
[1:00:23] you're not either.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; We want the living God,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; do we not? We want him more. I mean, we
[1:00:28] don't just want to rest on yesterday's
[1:00:30] testimonies. We want to see him alive
[1:00:32] today. I mean, because he hasn't changed
[1:00:34] one, but what he was yesterday, he's the
[1:00:36] same God today. But that that but that
[1:00:38] spirit of the son of predition, that
[1:00:39] antichrist spirit will try and come in,
[1:00:41] make you lukewarm, formal, and powerless
[1:00:43] because he does not want you to anoint
[1:00:46] the word for what it's about to do.
[1:00:50] Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading this. I like it. She
[1:00:53] had the power of um of the spirit
[1:00:55] manifested in diver signs and wonders
[1:00:57] and gifts of the Holy Ghost. Hebrews 2
[1:00:59] um 1:4. Therefore, we ought to give the
[1:01:01] more earnest heed to the things which we
[1:01:02] have heard, least at any time we should
[1:01:04] let them slip. For if the word spoken by
[1:01:06] angels was steadfast, and every
[1:01:08] transgression and disobedience to the
[1:01:10] word received a just recompense of the
[1:01:12] reward, I mean I mean of reward, how
[1:01:14] shall we escape if we neglect so great a
[1:01:16] salvation which is at first began to be
[1:01:19] spoken by the Lord? And was confirmed
[1:01:21] unto us by them that heard him? God also
[1:01:23] bearing them witness both with signs and
[1:01:25] wonders and with diverse miracles, the
[1:01:27] gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:01:29] own will. That original church was not
[1:01:31] organized by men. It was led by the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost. It wasn't very big. It was hated,
[1:01:36] despised. It was oppressed. It was
[1:01:38] persecuted unto death. But it was the tr
[1:01:40] but it was true to God. It stayed with
[1:01:42] the original word pattern.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; We want to That's the old path. Amen.
[1:01:47] That's the old path at least to rest for
[1:01:49] your souls. That's the original path.
[1:01:52] Now, don't get led astray here. When I
[1:01:54] said that God and his ways never change,
[1:01:56] I did not say the church and its
[1:01:57] messengers could not change. The church
[1:01:59] isn't God, so she can change. But what I
[1:02:02] said that uh because of the unchanging
[1:02:04] God with unchanging ways we can go back
[1:02:06] to the beginning and see the first and
[1:02:08] perfect act of God then judge that by
[1:02:10] that standard. That is how it is done.
[1:02:12] The true church will always try to be
[1:02:14] like the original at Pentecost. The true
[1:02:16] church of today will try to approximate
[1:02:19] that early first one. And the messengers
[1:02:21] to the churches having the same spirit
[1:02:23] of God in them will try to approximate
[1:02:25] the apostle Paul. They won't be exactly
[1:02:28] like him, but the true messengers will
[1:02:30] be the ones that will come the closest
[1:02:32] to Paul, who are free from all men, sold
[1:02:34] out to God, and gave forth the word of
[1:02:37] God only and manifested the Holy Ghost
[1:02:40] and power none else would do. You have
[1:02:42] to work from the original as like begget
[1:02:45] like. The true church always be the one
[1:02:47] that tries to follow in the steps of her
[1:02:49] founders at Pentecost, and her
[1:02:51] messengers will follow. The Apostle
[1:02:53] Paul, the first messenger to the first
[1:02:55] church age. It is that simple and that
[1:02:58] wonderful.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that. Don't you? Amen.
[1:03:02] Where we are called to to not not to
[1:03:05] deviate into just a intellectual
[1:03:07] revival. Amen. The opening of the word
[1:03:10] brings power. It always does. Amen. You
[1:03:13] can take it in your own personal life.
[1:03:14] When Calvary went from a story to
[1:03:17] reality, it became a revelation. And
[1:03:19] what did that do? It released power into
[1:03:21] your life to live above sin. It changed
[1:03:23] your nature. It changed your desires.
[1:03:25] Does it change your outlook? Because the
[1:03:27] revelation that Jesus died for you
[1:03:29] became real in your life. It went from
[1:03:31] story to reality. So what happened is
[1:03:34] the word came open to you and changed
[1:03:36] your life. Amen. And then it opened
[1:03:38] further. Amen. Where you realize
[1:03:40] actually I can live a holy life by the
[1:03:42] holiness of God. I mean God has
[1:03:44] sanctified me. He's cleansed me. Amen.
[1:03:46] What is that? The word opened further.
[1:03:48] It released a power. Are you with me?
[1:03:50] This this is what revelation should do.
[1:03:52] I mean, it does not just fill your mind
[1:03:54] with a bunch of information. No, it
[1:03:56] anchors down into our souls and it
[1:03:58] produces the life of God. Do you realize
[1:04:01] that you've got a powerhouse of
[1:04:02] revelation in your soul that God's been
[1:04:05] depositing year after year, service
[1:04:07] after service? Every time you open your
[1:04:09] Bible, God's been anchoring his word.
[1:04:11] It's been releasing a power into your
[1:04:13] life that once you once were struggling
[1:04:15] with, you've overcome. Why? Because the
[1:04:17] power of God has come in.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:22] Amen. You say, "Well, what did they
[1:04:24] have?" Well, let's go back to the
[1:04:27] original. You say, "Well, does this mean
[1:04:28] we got to go from house to house and not
[1:04:29] have church buildings?" That's what
[1:04:31] that's not what he's talking about to
[1:04:32] me. To me, he's talking about God
[1:04:34] dwelling in his church.
[1:04:37] So, Peter would stand up. You see, they
[1:04:40] would he would stand up because, you
[1:04:42] know, on the day of Pentecost, this is
[1:04:43] the standard now. and and the people on
[1:04:46] the outside of the upper room are
[1:04:48] hearing a bunch of noise and commotion,
[1:04:49] seeing everyone act like a bunch of
[1:04:50] drunk people. And then Peter stood up
[1:04:53] and said, "Be this known unto you and
[1:04:54] hearken to my words for these are not
[1:04:56] drunken as you suppose but the third
[1:04:58] hour of the day, but this is that which
[1:05:00] is spoken by the prophet Joel." Amen. So
[1:05:03] the re So so so the inspiration that
[1:05:05] struck the prophet Joel, Amen, was no
[1:05:07] longer just a prophecy floating around,
[1:05:10] if I could put it that way, but it had
[1:05:11] now become flesh. It had become material
[1:05:14] in the 120 in the upper room. And that's
[1:05:17] why they staggered like drunk people
[1:05:18] because the impact of that revelation so
[1:05:21] gripped them. It so overwhelmed them
[1:05:23] that now God was with us. Now he's in
[1:05:25] us. Amen. That he's not just some God
[1:05:27] somewhere, but now he's present in me
[1:05:29] now. Amen. Cuz God said, "I'll pour my
[1:05:31] spirit out upon all flesh." And Peter
[1:05:33] was saying, "What you read about in Joel
[1:05:35] and what you argued about in Joel was
[1:05:37] now living in front of you." That now
[1:05:39] these people are acting this way cuz
[1:05:41] they're so overcome. They become
[1:05:43] intoxicated. Amen. By the fact that God
[1:05:45] is now within them. God was fulfilling
[1:05:48] prophecy. Amen. And what? So, so it was
[1:05:50] a revelation struck their lives and that
[1:05:52] was the manifestation of that
[1:05:54] revelation. Amen. So they they they had
[1:05:57] the revelation that the almighty God was
[1:05:59] now dwelling in them. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:01] You know, you know, the disciples in
[1:06:03] Mark chapter 13, I don't have it up here
[1:06:04] on me. I mean I mean I mean up here uh
[1:06:07] Mark 13 but you know Jesus would be
[1:06:09] taken by his disciples to the temple and
[1:06:12] you know Jesus you know the disciples
[1:06:14] would see the temple and the buildings
[1:06:15] and they'd say Lord what great manner of
[1:06:17] stones and buildings are here
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; and the Lord Jesus is looking at them
[1:06:21] he's looking at the temple and the first
[1:06:23] thing he says is not one stone is going
[1:06:24] to be left upon another. So you're so
[1:06:27] marveling at this masonry. You're so
[1:06:29] marveling at this craftsmanship and this
[1:06:31] building and the size and all these kind
[1:06:33] of things. And Jesus is saying, "Look,
[1:06:34] I'm going to do away with this thing."
[1:06:36] And he was actually looking, his
[1:06:37] disciples were there in their rags and
[1:06:39] they were homeless and they didn't have
[1:06:40] any, they didn't look like anything to
[1:06:42] the world. But Jesus was looking at them
[1:06:44] and he saying look you know in manner of
[1:06:48] speaking he could have said those stones
[1:06:50] are nothing compared to you
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; because you are going to be the first
[1:06:54] part of the building of the bride of
[1:06:55] Jesus Christ. I mean you're going to be
[1:06:57] the foundation stones. I mean those
[1:06:59] stones are going to do away with because
[1:07:00] I'm going to bring it to a greater
[1:07:01] temple. Amen. Not a not a temple of
[1:07:04] stone and wood and gold and all these
[1:07:05] things but a living stone. Amen. Christ
[1:07:08] would be in the church. Amen.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. and they're there with their
[1:07:11] rags thinking we're not important. We're
[1:07:13] not the who's who. And God said, "You
[1:07:15] are the who's who in his economy." Are
[1:07:17] you here today? Amen. Because you got to
[1:07:19] realize we look at ourselves and think
[1:07:21] we don't have any selfworth many times
[1:07:23] and we don't think we're worth anything.
[1:07:24] And God said, "No, you're not the
[1:07:26] foundation stones. You're the finishing
[1:07:28] stones." Amen. You're part of the body
[1:07:30] of Christ. Amen. You're the you're the
[1:07:32] bits of stone that I've been looking for
[1:07:34] and I found you. I've placed you in my
[1:07:35] body. Amen. You are the most valuable
[1:07:37] pieces of stone. You look at marble, you
[1:07:40] you look at the Vatican, all its all
[1:07:42] that stuff, they say it's priceless.
[1:07:44] That ain't priceless. This is priceless.
[1:07:47] I mean, the redeemed of the Lord are
[1:07:49] priceless. You can't ensure you.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Only God can ensure you cuz he doesn't
[1:07:54] run out of funds. But you see there,
[1:07:56] there's no value you can actually put
[1:07:58] upon your own soul.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; The, you know, the prophet said your
[1:08:02] soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds. I
[1:08:05] don't even know what the monetary value.
[1:08:06] They don't even know really what the
[1:08:08] resources in this whole earth are.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; We just dig down. I don't know how far
[1:08:11] down below the crust. It's not that deep
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; really. And we find all this stuff and
[1:08:16] billions of dollars, all these things.
[1:08:17] They don't know what's all the way down
[1:08:18] to the core and the core in terms of
[1:08:20] valuable minerals and all these things.
[1:08:22] And God can look down into your life and
[1:08:24] say, "You're worth more than 10,000 of
[1:08:26] those things you can't even put a value
[1:08:28] to." And yet people will stuff a put a
[1:08:32] few dollars on them and you know dress
[1:08:35] up this thing and they don't cater to
[1:08:38] their soul. Come back to the good path,
[1:08:41] the old path and you'll see the value of
[1:08:43] your soul.
[1:08:47] Amen. And then I put here in verse 21
[1:08:49] that it shall come to pass that
[1:08:51] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:08:52] Lord shall be saved. So Peter is saying
[1:08:55] basically when you see all this happen,
[1:08:57] call on the Lord. You're in his
[1:08:58] presence. You see him fulfilling his
[1:09:00] word. Call on his name then and see what
[1:09:02] happens.
[1:09:04] Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, revelation
[1:09:09] has prevailing power.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Those disciples,
[1:09:14] you know, you're made of the same stuff.
[1:09:17] Those disciples had a revelation in
[1:09:19] them. They had Christ in them, the hope
[1:09:20] of glory, and it gave them overcoming
[1:09:23] power. God knew what they were going to
[1:09:25] face from that upper room time. But he
[1:09:28] had confidence what he had placed in
[1:09:29] them was greater than anything that the
[1:09:31] world could put upon them. I tell you as
[1:09:34] like the prophet says there's nothing
[1:09:35] with as prevailing power is revelation.
[1:09:39] Amen. Prevailing power means it's
[1:09:40] greater. It's stronger. It's bigger. It
[1:09:43] wins. It comes out packing the victory.
[1:09:46] That's what revelation does. Amen. And
[1:09:48] we're not sitting here just with a
[1:09:50] mental knowledge. No. God's put mighty
[1:09:52] revelations in you. things that things
[1:09:54] that Bible schools fuss and argue about
[1:09:56] for generations. God just opened the
[1:09:58] message to you, put it in your soul, and
[1:10:00] God just gave you the right
[1:10:01] interpretation of the word. You weren't
[1:10:03] looking for it, but it was looking for
[1:10:05] you. And then now you could basically go
[1:10:06] and answer all their questions.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Well, where did you learn this from?
[1:10:10] Well, heaven, actually.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God gave it to me. And I'm not
[1:10:15] saying that in a very light way. We
[1:10:16] should actually reverence
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; God, you you opened your heart to me,
[1:10:20] God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You actually revealed yourself.
[1:10:24] You became vulnerable to me because you
[1:10:25] revealed what you really love and what
[1:10:28] you care about. You didn't give me some
[1:10:31] facade.
[1:10:32] God's really revealed himself to us.
[1:10:35] That's incredible.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, it's given prevailing power
[1:10:42] of revelation is given to you because he
[1:10:44] wants that prevailing power to manifest
[1:10:46] in you.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the revelation of the seven
[1:10:49] seals is Christ revealing himself,
[1:10:52] right? It's not information. I remember
[1:10:55] actually the first time I listened to
[1:10:56] the seals, I saw horse riders. I saw
[1:10:58] tribulation and the two witnesses and
[1:11:00] all these things. But then the next
[1:11:02] time, the only thing I saw was the lamb
[1:11:04] stepping forth to claim me. That's what
[1:11:07] I saw the second time. I didn't see
[1:11:09] horse riders. I didn't see the
[1:11:10] antichrist and all these things. I
[1:11:12] didn't see that. All I saw was him
[1:11:14] coming forward to get a hold of me. And
[1:11:17] what has that done? That's given me
[1:11:18] prevailing power in my life cuz I
[1:11:20] realize doesn't matter how bad things
[1:11:22] get, how trouble thing things are, mind
[1:11:24] bails forever more. No. If the Lord
[1:11:26] stepped forth and he's placed his hand
[1:11:28] on you, place his hand on me saying
[1:11:30] actually the reason I open the book is
[1:11:32] for you to realize you're part of me.
[1:11:34] I've come to get a hold of you through
[1:11:36] my word. This is what this message does.
[1:11:38] It's actually like a it's like a hook.
[1:11:40] It grips the predestinated. Amen.
[1:11:43] Because it's actually God himself, the
[1:11:44] logos himself coming down speaking
[1:11:46] through a prophet office. Amen. To
[1:11:48] reveal the heart of God to you and I.
[1:11:51] Praise God.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something in us says yes.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Well, can you work it out? No, I can't
[1:11:57] work it out. But it's there's something
[1:11:59] in me says, I feel the pull. I hear the
[1:12:01] call. I'm coming, Lord.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:08] So now if if the Lord has put a hand on
[1:12:11] our lives through his word, he has
[1:12:13] stepped forth to get me. No devil can
[1:12:16] stop him doing that.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Try and get in his way, you get
[1:12:19] bulldozed, you are cruising for a
[1:12:20] bruising. Nothing, nothing can stop him.
[1:12:24] Nothing can stop the Lord. But you see
[1:12:26] Judas now, he wanted to put a dampener
[1:12:29] on what Mary was doing. He wanted to
[1:12:32] create an atmosphere of she's gone
[1:12:34] overboard. She's gone beyond what's
[1:12:37] acceptable, but she was anointing him
[1:12:39] for what he's about to do. And I think
[1:12:41] we should be very much in that kind of
[1:12:43] frame of mind with praise and
[1:12:45] thanksgiving.
[1:12:46] Lord, you've given us a standard of you
[1:12:49] dwelling in all the people. It's not
[1:12:51] just in the pulpit, but it's in the pew.
[1:12:53] God lives in the old, the young, men,
[1:12:55] women, boys and girls. That's what God
[1:12:57] wants. Amen. But you see that that that
[1:13:00] that spirit of Judas, that antichrist
[1:13:02] spirit wants to stop that from taking
[1:13:04] place.
[1:13:07] But now we're going to talk about the
[1:13:08] old paths.
[1:13:10] Here's the original path. This is the
[1:13:13] old way. It's very simple because Peter
[1:13:18] was preaching there and he and then
[1:13:19] prick their hearts. Men and brethren,
[1:13:21] what shall we do? And he says very
[1:13:23] simply, repent, be baptized in the name
[1:13:25] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:13:26] sin, and you shall receive the gift of
[1:13:28] the Holy Ghost for the promise unto you
[1:13:30] and to your children, although that are
[1:13:32] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[1:13:34] God shall call. This is this is the this
[1:13:36] is the old path.
[1:13:39] This is the path that works.
[1:13:44] You know, the good the great physician
[1:13:47] handed down a prescription to Dr. Peter
[1:13:50] on the day of Pentecost and he gave he
[1:13:53] gave the medicine that will cure every
[1:13:56] problem. And so now the people that
[1:13:59] heard Peter preach, they're asking,
[1:14:00] "What can we do to get this
[1:14:02] prescription?" And Peter said, "This is
[1:14:05] the prescription. This is the remedy for
[1:14:07] the problem of you're just here."
[1:14:09] Because remember, remember those outside
[1:14:12] the upper room, they were just
[1:14:13] traditionally
[1:14:15] they were Pentecostal people. They had
[1:14:17] come to the feast of Pentecost.
[1:14:19] They weren't there for the fulfillment
[1:14:21] of the scripture. But when they saw the
[1:14:23] scripture be fulfilled, then Peter gave
[1:14:25] them the prescription. This is how you
[1:14:27] become part of the fulfillment of the
[1:14:29] word. And then so what did it do? He
[1:14:31] wrote out a prescription and that
[1:14:33] prescription is an eternal prescription.
[1:14:36] It will give you rest for your soul.
[1:14:39] Amen. It's the old as our opening
[1:14:42] scripture was ask for the old paths
[1:14:44] where is the good way and walk therein
[1:14:45] and you shall find rest for your souls.
[1:14:47] Now there is I don't want to I I don't
[1:14:52] want to be negative for a bit but I just
[1:14:54] want you to think about these things.
[1:14:55] people people have have changed that
[1:14:58] prescription
[1:14:59] down through the ages where where many
[1:15:02] Christian denominations today they have
[1:15:05] no assurance that they're saved. They
[1:15:08] have no rest for their souls. They need
[1:15:10] to somehow work their way into heaven.
[1:15:13] Catholics, Jehovah's Witness, Mormon,
[1:15:16] many other denominations, it's all about
[1:15:18] good works. And have I done enough to
[1:15:21] merit entrance into heaven? We don't
[1:15:23] merit nothing. We don't have to earn it.
[1:15:25] He's given it freely. Amen. It's just
[1:15:27] medicine. Just take it. Take this gospel
[1:15:29] and you'll become fine. Amen. Don't just
[1:15:32] don't just well find a substitute around
[1:15:34] it. No. You just walk in this old path
[1:15:37] and you'll find that it works. Because
[1:15:39] when the Lord Jesus came, God tested
[1:15:42] this prescription upon himself before he
[1:15:46] gave it out. Amen. He didn't just test
[1:15:48] or theorize it, then give it out and see
[1:15:50] what it would happen. He He tested it
[1:15:53] himself.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went down to the River Jordan.
[1:15:56] He's filled with the fullness of God.
[1:15:58] What what happened? He received the Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost without measure. Okay? And then he
[1:16:02] proved it. Does this medicine work?
[1:16:05] Well, he came against tradition. It
[1:16:07] conquered tradition. Amen. He came
[1:16:09] against culture. It sure conquered that
[1:16:11] one. It came against unbelief. It didn't
[1:16:13] hinder him. I mean, because you got to
[1:16:14] realize when you take a when you take a
[1:16:16] medicine, you take a vaccine, I trust
[1:16:18] that's not a dirty word here. You know
[1:16:20] what does it do? It actually stimulates
[1:16:22] an immune response within you. Amen.
[1:16:24] That when you come in contact with it
[1:16:26] again, your immune system says, "I've
[1:16:28] seen that before." And it can take it
[1:16:30] out. Right? Now, spiritually, we have
[1:16:32] our immune system was actually dead, but
[1:16:34] now it's come alive because the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost is our spiritual immune system. I
[1:16:38] mean that's really God has come into our
[1:16:40] spirits that when a foreign object that
[1:16:43] doesn't belong in us that's there
[1:16:44] actually to destroy us comes in. I mean
[1:16:46] what happens is our immune system of the
[1:16:48] Holy Ghost comes to life and it says
[1:16:50] I've seen this before. I've already
[1:16:52] conquered it. Now I'm going to conquer
[1:16:54] it in you. Sure you may have some
[1:16:55] symptoms. You may have a bit of a fever.
[1:16:57] Now I'm talking spiritually now. Okay.
[1:16:59] I'm using natural to parallel, right?
[1:17:01] But surely you may have a fever. You may
[1:17:02] have a mind better. You may have a
[1:17:04] troubled spirit. You may have these
[1:17:05] things. But the reason there is actually
[1:17:06] a trouble. you haven't just gulped it
[1:17:08] down like you did before you met the
[1:17:10] Lord. It's cuz there's now a resistance.
[1:17:12] Now there's antibodies of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:14] coming out. Amen. And waring against the
[1:17:16] spirit saying you're not welcome here.
[1:17:18] Amen. No, this is my temple.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So now when the
[1:17:23] Lord Jesus was here, Amen. He, you know,
[1:17:26] it conquered in him. It proved it
[1:17:28] doesn't matter what reputation you have,
[1:17:30] it'll conquer that reputation. Remember
[1:17:32] Jesus was born with a with a bad name.
[1:17:35] And they said, "Well, Mary was
[1:17:36] impregnated by a soldier and Joseph's
[1:17:38] not his father." And of course, I don't
[1:17:40] think when Mary uh when Jesus was born,
[1:17:42] he did he did not look like Joseph. He
[1:17:45] didn't look look like Mary either. He
[1:17:47] was God, right? And normally, especially
[1:17:50] the firstborn, sorry, Analise, looks
[1:17:51] very much like the father.
[1:17:55] But that's proof that the child's his,
[1:17:59] right? But then when Mary had it, didn't
[1:18:01] look like Joseph.
[1:18:04] So he had to but the the toxine the
[1:18:07] revelation of who he was overcame that
[1:18:10] it overcame religious tradition. It
[1:18:13] overcame people trying to entangle him
[1:18:15] in his words try and stop him preaching
[1:18:17] stop him. Even when his own disciple
[1:18:19] Peter said you know Lord you can't go to
[1:18:22] Calvary. It conquered that. Get behind
[1:18:24] me Satan. He saw the the he saw the
[1:18:26] anointing upon Peter was not Peter. It
[1:18:28] wasn't God. It was the enemy trying to
[1:18:30] stop the whole thing. Amen. And then
[1:18:32] what it do? That that same prescription
[1:18:34] overcame um overcame
[1:18:38] superstition,
[1:18:39] overcame the wrong interpretation of
[1:18:41] what the Messiah should be. They thought
[1:18:43] the Messiah would be a mighty general
[1:18:45] who would raise an army and start a
[1:18:46] revolution, drive the Romans out. That
[1:18:49] toxine, I mean, that prescription
[1:18:51] stopped them getting swept up in what
[1:18:54] the world thought he should be.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:58] Does it? I trust you can you can look at
[1:19:01] it the same thing. The world wants to
[1:19:03] shape a Christian a certain way.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Just be a good person.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Be a good boy. Just behave. That ain't
[1:19:11] Christianity. That's just being a good
[1:19:13] per That's just part of that's just
[1:19:15] being a decent human being. Christianity
[1:19:17] is not just filling a pew and being a
[1:19:19] good person conforming to a culture. No,
[1:19:21] Christianity is real. It's rugged. Amen.
[1:19:24] God reveals himself. He wants to take
[1:19:26] you on adventures. prove his word. Amen.
[1:19:28] It's not just some suburban box living
[1:19:30] in a box all the same. That's why, you
[1:19:32] know, they say out in the church world
[1:19:34] out there, they say men are leaving
[1:19:35] Christianity cuz they find it boring.
[1:19:38] Cuz it's been feminized. Just be a good
[1:19:40] person. Like the school system making,
[1:19:42] oh, all boys are naughty. No, not all
[1:19:44] boys are naughty. Boys are boys. They've
[1:19:47] got allowed to be boys. You can't make
[1:19:48] them girls. They're boys. Amen. So,
[1:19:50] they've got energy. They want to they
[1:19:52] they look at things differently. They're
[1:19:53] more boisterous and all these things.
[1:19:55] That's a good thing. All the boys said,
[1:19:56] "Amen."
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Good. We've got a few here. You know,
[1:20:02] but they see they said, "But but but but
[1:20:05] the church world has made it boring to
[1:20:07] be a Christian." It ain't boring. It's a
[1:20:11] glorious thing.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, God wants you out of your
[1:20:13] comfort zone. He He stirs up the nest.
[1:20:15] He says, "Come fly with me. I'll prove
[1:20:17] my word in your life." Don't just sit
[1:20:19] back and just be a conformed to a, "Oh,
[1:20:21] I go to Shikina Tabernacle." That's got
[1:20:23] nothing to do with it. I'm going to
[1:20:25] conform. Oh yeah, I just fit in with the
[1:20:27] groupy. No, it's an individual walk.
[1:20:29] Amen. But the son of predition wants to
[1:20:31] keep you as part of the groupy. But God
[1:20:33] wants you to be sure part of the body,
[1:20:35] but walk with him.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; There's a big difference. I trust that
[1:20:38] all came out okay. God wants to walk
[1:20:40] with you. Don't just sit back. This is
[1:20:42] not a time to sit back and say, "Well,
[1:20:44] oh, what should I do?" No. Put a foot
[1:20:46] forward. God will direct your steps. Let
[1:20:48] him live in your life. Have a burden for
[1:20:50] souls. Amen. Have a desire to see, God,
[1:20:52] I want to see this message live. Amen.
[1:20:56] Praise the Lord. You see, so and then
[1:20:59] and then of course this prescription, he
[1:21:02] went to Calvary and before that he said,
[1:21:04] "I'll show you what the prescription
[1:21:05] says. No man take my life from me. I lay
[1:21:08] it down. I'll pick it up again." And he
[1:21:10] did. Amen. That prescription made him
[1:21:13] overcome death, hell, and the grave and
[1:21:15] rise up victorious. And then once he had
[1:21:17] proved it in its completeness, he says,
[1:21:19] "No, I'm going to send it down upon the
[1:21:20] church." Amen. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:21:22] send this way upon the church because I
[1:21:24] know it works. I'm not It's not some
[1:21:26] marketing, you know, ploy to twist
[1:21:28] things to make it appear like it's
[1:21:30] better than it is. No, it is what it is.
[1:21:32] Amen. He sent it down into the
[1:21:34] disciples, those men and women, the 120.
[1:21:36] Amen. And it begin to spread and they
[1:21:38] begin to find what did it do? It changed
[1:21:40] cows into into courageous men and women.
[1:21:43] Amen. Where Peter buckled at the
[1:21:44] testimony of a couple of women by a
[1:21:46] fire. I mean, he boldly stood there and
[1:21:48] said, "No, we will not stop preaching in
[1:21:50] the name of Jesus Christ. Should we obey
[1:21:52] man or God? You tell us what we should
[1:21:54] do." I mean, it gave them a boldness.
[1:21:56] And you know what's amazing? When the
[1:21:57] enemy put pressure upon them to make
[1:21:59] them stop preaching, made them kind of
[1:22:01] settle down and kind of hide in the
[1:22:03] shadows. They had a prayer meeting cuz
[1:22:05] they knew that this that this
[1:22:06] prescription works. Amen. And they had a
[1:22:09] prayer meeting and God came and shook
[1:22:10] the place. Amen. And God filled them
[1:22:12] with boldness and their immune system
[1:22:14] just got stronger because of the
[1:22:16] persecution.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; I trust you find the same thing in your
[1:22:20] life. You haven't got weaker, you got
[1:22:22] stronger. Amen. Spiritually stronger.
[1:22:25] What you are now, you're way stronger
[1:22:26] than what you were in the beginning.
[1:22:27] Why? Because your immune system is be
[1:22:30] spiritually become stronger, more rugged
[1:22:32] and robust.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see what happens is many
[1:22:39] many quack doctors have changed the
[1:22:42] prescription.
[1:22:43] And a quack doctor is a fraudulent or
[1:22:46] ignorant pretender of medical skill.
[1:22:48] Someone who claims to have knowledge or
[1:22:50] qualifications they do not possess.
[1:22:52] That's a quack doctor. Someone who just
[1:22:54] pretends to yes I'm a doctor. I've got
[1:22:56] some things. But they're not qualified.
[1:22:58] You say, "Well, what kind of
[1:22:59] qualification should we have?" The
[1:23:01] qualification we should all have and
[1:23:03] must have is a burning bush experience.
[1:23:05] Amen. Brother Ram said that you can't
[1:23:07] call yourself a Christian without that
[1:23:09] kind of experience where you've know
[1:23:10] you've met God.
[1:23:13] Amen. No one can stand behind the
[1:23:14] pullpit without a burning bush
[1:23:15] experience because once you've had a
[1:23:17] burning bush experience and that burning
[1:23:19] that flame of God comes into you and
[1:23:21] then it spreads all to everyone around
[1:23:23] you creates an atmosphere of God. Amen.
[1:23:25] That if they want it they'll fall into
[1:23:27] it.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've never seen a bush
[1:23:29] on fire." I'm not talking about having
[1:23:31] the same exact experience. But whatever
[1:23:33] happens to you, you know something's
[1:23:35] happened. Amen. Because the Bible says
[1:23:37] by their fruits you shall know them.
[1:23:38] That's what Jesus said. Not by their
[1:23:40] words, not by what they profess, but the
[1:23:43] life that they live. Amen. Is a
[1:23:44] vindication. They've had a burning bush
[1:23:46] experience.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:50] When you come in contact with the living
[1:23:52] God, you'll live a different life. Amen.
[1:23:55] The word will live out of you. Your
[1:23:56] attitude will change. Your appetite will
[1:23:58] change. Your your nature will change.
[1:24:01] God will do a great work. But you see
[1:24:04] quack doctors just say, "Well, no, just
[1:24:06] just say a sinner's prayer.
[1:24:09] Just come and shake the hand of the
[1:24:11] preacher."
[1:24:12] That's a quack doctor. That does not
[1:24:14] produce a Pentecost.
[1:24:19] Even says here, we'll go here. This is
[1:24:22] in Ezekiel. Her priests have violated my
[1:24:24] law, have profaneed my holy things. They
[1:24:26] have put no difference between the holy
[1:24:28] and the profane. Neither have they
[1:24:30] showed the difference between the
[1:24:31] unclean and the clean. and they have hid
[1:24:33] their eyes from my Sabbaths and I am
[1:24:36] profaneed among them. This is what
[1:24:38] happened. This is what has happened
[1:24:39] today. There's no difference between
[1:24:42] holy and profane. It's all come all the
[1:24:44] same.
[1:24:46] The church world has done this. They
[1:24:48] because they've tampered with the
[1:24:49] prescription where God changes a life.
[1:24:52] They don't it doesn't change no more.
[1:24:54] They act the same, dress the same, do
[1:24:56] the same things. They come to church,
[1:24:58] they have a religious way of doing
[1:24:59] things, but that's it. There's no change
[1:25:01] of life. There's no change of heart.
[1:25:03] Why? Because the prescription was
[1:25:05] tampered with to try and make it more
[1:25:07] palatable. Because we know medicine does
[1:25:09] not taste yum.
[1:25:11] This medicine requires a death to self.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Requires a real repentance. And
[1:25:16] repentance is not saying sorry. That's
[1:25:18] just cuz you got caught. True repentance
[1:25:20] say Lord change my heart and mind away
[1:25:22] from sin to you.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's what real repentance is. Amen. So
[1:25:27] there's no different see from see it's
[1:25:29] changed from a genuine repentance I mean
[1:25:31] just to saying well I'm sorry that's
[1:25:33] that's a quack doctor a quack drugist
[1:25:37] that's changed to just sprinkle babies
[1:25:40] when they're born shake the hands of the
[1:25:42] preacher repeat a sinner's prayer join a
[1:25:44] church or it's even come to a conforming
[1:25:47] to a message Christian culture that's a
[1:25:50] quack drugist
[1:25:53] a quack doctor
[1:25:55] it's you
[1:25:57] saying people say, "Well, I believe the
[1:25:58] Bible. I believe the message. The devil
[1:26:00] does the same thing." You're just on the
[1:26:02] same category as Satan. It's got to be
[1:26:04] more than that. Sorry, J. It says in
[1:26:06] James, you believe in one God.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; You do. Well, the devil also believes
[1:26:10] and trembles.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; So, you just on his part. We're not
[1:26:13] meant to be on par with the devil. We're
[1:26:14] meant to be where Christ is,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; right? So, it's more than just having a
[1:26:17] mental recognition. Yes. You know,
[1:26:19] Brother Bram, if you ever hear him, he
[1:26:21] speaks against creeds and dogmas. Who's
[1:26:22] heard that? Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; A creed is just a formal profession of
[1:26:25] faith.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; So if you say, "Well, I believe William
[1:26:28] Brown's Malachi 4 and I believe the
[1:26:30] message is the true revelation of the
[1:26:32] Bible and I believe we've been turned to
[1:26:33] the hearts of the fathers." That can
[1:26:34] just be a creed.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; If it's not living, it's just saying a
[1:26:39] creed.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Even people say, "Well, I believe every
[1:26:42] word he says."
[1:26:45] That is still Wait, I'm I'm pressing the
[1:26:47] wrong thing.
[1:26:49] There's quack drugists out there that
[1:26:51] say just say you believe the message and
[1:26:52] you've got eternal life. The devil
[1:26:54] believes it. He was there service after
[1:26:57] service, prayer line after prayer line,
[1:26:59] being cast out, being exposed. He knows
[1:27:02] the power of God. Doesn't save him. And
[1:27:06] it says here in the token, don't just
[1:27:07] come this far and say, I believe the
[1:27:09] message. You obey the messenger. Come
[1:27:10] into Christ. You say, well, I believe
[1:27:12] every word you um I believe every word
[1:27:14] said, brother Bram. That's good, but
[1:27:15] that's just being able to read.
[1:27:18] But a quack drugist will say, "Just say
[1:27:21] you believe every word and you've got
[1:27:23] it." It's more than that. There's got to
[1:27:26] be a manifestation of that revelation.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Right? There's got to be a reality. Take
[1:27:31] the message into your heart that you
[1:27:33] must have the token, the very life that
[1:27:34] was in Christ being you. When I see
[1:27:36] that, I'll pass over you.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; You see, this is this is sadly
[1:27:44] what's been going on.
[1:27:46] And then it's become so diluted down
[1:27:49] because you know holy to be holy if you
[1:27:51] if we go back there
[1:27:53] to be holy means to be separated to God.
[1:27:56] That's what holiness is. God has
[1:27:58] separated you unto himself. Okay. But
[1:28:00] it's come down to such a point that
[1:28:03] there's no, you know, they said, "Who
[1:28:04] cares about denomination? We believe all
[1:28:06] in the same Jesus. Let's just let's just
[1:28:08] all rally together and we're going to
[1:28:10] make the world Christian again." That's
[1:28:12] a trap. That's a trap. Remember the son
[1:28:15] of predition is in the temple of God
[1:28:18] showing himself as God and is worshiped
[1:28:20] as God. We read that in 2 Thessalonians.
[1:28:23] So the devil puts himself forward and
[1:28:26] people think they're worshiping Jesus
[1:28:27] Christ, but they're actually worshiping
[1:28:28] Satan because of false doctrine and
[1:28:30] tradition. That's a big stomach full,
[1:28:32] but sadly that's the case. You see, it's
[1:28:34] a trap. See, we got to realize, no, God
[1:28:36] has separated us unto his word. Amen.
[1:28:40] that see see there is a difference
[1:28:41] between the between the holy and the
[1:28:44] profane or the clean and the unclean.
[1:28:47] And it says also and I've um and and
[1:28:50] they have hid their eyes from my
[1:28:51] Sabbaths. What's a Sabbath? It's rest.
[1:28:54] And the true Sabbath is the baptism of
[1:28:56] the Holy Ghost. We enter into rest. So
[1:28:58] they've hid their eyes from from
[1:29:00] actually what the Sabbath is. And
[1:29:03] because they've done that, you know,
[1:29:04] because if their eyes are open, if you
[1:29:06] really realize, God really changes
[1:29:08] people. God really trans their eyes from
[1:29:10] the Lord's Sabbath, the Lord's rest, and
[1:29:12] they've allowed all these things to
[1:29:13] happen. But I'm so thankful
[1:29:17] that this that the great eternal
[1:29:19] prescription,
[1:29:21] it's hard to die, but you got to die
[1:29:24] out. You can't just say, "I was raised
[1:29:26] in the message, therefore I'm a
[1:29:27] believer." There's got to be a time when
[1:29:29] you lay your life down. We say, "Lord,"
[1:29:31] you say, "Well, what do I need to repent
[1:29:32] from?" Say, "God, change my heart and my
[1:29:35] mind to you.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Turn my heart, Lord. Turn my thinking,
[1:29:39] Lord. Change me, Lord." Amen. It works.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "No uh need of me writing
[1:29:49] out four or five prescriptions. I just
[1:29:51] need to write out one for you and your
[1:29:52] children and your children's children,
[1:29:54] them that are far off, even as many as
[1:29:55] the Lord our God shall call." He said,
[1:29:57] "It won't do to write anymore. I'll
[1:29:59] write one eternal prescription for you.
[1:30:01] He said, "Repent every one of you. Be
[1:30:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:30:04] the remission of your sins, and you
[1:30:06] shall be inoculated. For the promise is
[1:30:08] unto you and to your children, to them
[1:30:10] that are far off, even as many as the
[1:30:11] Lord our God shall call." Yes, brother.
[1:30:13] We've got bal and Gilead. We got
[1:30:15] doctors. Then why is the people in the
[1:30:18] condition they are today? It's because
[1:30:19] they refuse to take it. That's all. We
[1:30:21] got doctors. We've got the prescription.
[1:30:23] We've got the toxin that kills sin, that
[1:30:25] heals the body, that makes a new
[1:30:27] creature in Christ Jesus. But it's the
[1:30:29] people that don't want it to take it.
[1:30:31] They don't want they don't want the
[1:30:34] price. He says people are afraid of the
[1:30:36] new birth. He says even bre tabernacles
[1:30:39] got to that plate. They're afraid of the
[1:30:40] new birth. But it's essential.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; We have the prescription of the word.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; We've seen it prove itself time and time
[1:30:52] again in this day. Amen. We don't have a
[1:30:55] quack prescription. You know, we have a
[1:30:58] genuine prescription. But if you if
[1:31:00] people tamper with, oh, you know, I
[1:31:02] heard someone say, "Oh, people are
[1:31:03] coming to church, therefore, no, this is
[1:31:05] not here. Somewhere else. Oh, but these
[1:31:06] people are coming to church, therefore
[1:31:08] they're they're fine." And they're
[1:31:09] living in sin, drinking, all the they're
[1:31:12] they're bound by all these things. I
[1:31:13] feel sorry for them. But the but the
[1:31:15] doctors changed the prescription and is
[1:31:17] happy just with them coming to church.
[1:31:19] That's such a sad thing. We never want
[1:31:22] to be just satisfied with people coming
[1:31:24] in these doors. We're only satisfied
[1:31:26] when people come into Christ because
[1:31:28] that's when they're home free. Say,
[1:31:29] "Well, they're on their journey." I'm
[1:31:31] not satisfied with people just being on
[1:31:32] a journey. I want them in the city of
[1:31:34] refuge. I want them safe and secure for
[1:31:36] eternity. That's what I'm interested in.
[1:31:38] If you're on your journey, good. But
[1:31:39] just keep running. Don't stop. I mean,
[1:31:41] don't just stop at being a good person.
[1:31:43] Don't just stop at being even being
[1:31:44] baptized. No. Rest when you meet him.
[1:31:47] He's changed your life. And then you'll
[1:31:48] find overcoming power come into you and
[1:31:50] you'll be victory after victory. But
[1:31:52] you're home safe and secure.
[1:31:57] Amen.
[1:31:59] I'm I won't be too much longer.
[1:32:03] I mentioned this on Wednesday
[1:32:06] where Jesus was was brought to him a
[1:32:08] woman caught in adultery. And then so
[1:32:11] now the now here's the woman, here's the
[1:32:14] Lord Jesus, here's her accusers. And
[1:32:17] it's interesting, they don't bring the
[1:32:18] man, but they just bring the woman. And
[1:32:20] the law says meant to bring both. They
[1:32:22] just brought the woman. And then and
[1:32:23] then um you know they begin to challenge
[1:32:26] the one who actually gave the law on
[1:32:28] Sinai was now in flesh and they were
[1:32:30] challenging him about this and he just
[1:32:32] started writing in the sand. So So what
[1:32:35] he started doing he started writing to
[1:32:37] me he started writing all of their sins
[1:32:39] and their book of life and what they had
[1:32:42] done because it said from the oldest to
[1:32:43] the youngest they dropped their stones
[1:32:44] cuz their conscience gripped them and
[1:32:46] they all left. And then finally it came
[1:32:48] to this scene where where Jesus lifted
[1:32:51] himself up and saw none but the woman
[1:32:54] said unto her, "Woman, where are those
[1:32:55] thine accusers? Hath no man condemned
[1:32:57] thee?" Um and she said, "No man, Lord."
[1:33:00] And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I
[1:33:01] condemn thee. Go and sin no more." So
[1:33:04] she's been freed. She's now walking in
[1:33:07] forgiveness.
[1:33:09] And then I was mentioning about how
[1:33:10] imagine if she ran into her accusers in
[1:33:13] the marketplace. Now we got to realize,
[1:33:15] isn't it amazing when you read the
[1:33:17] gospels? The more Jesus did, the more
[1:33:19] the Pharisees, scribes hated him. It
[1:33:22] didn't actually change their hearts to
[1:33:23] say, "Hey, this is God." That just made
[1:33:26] them more mad. And that's what this son
[1:33:28] of predition, this a religious spirit
[1:33:30] does. It doesn't want God to fulfill his
[1:33:32] word. And so, so here and so what so,
[1:33:35] so, so these ones that dropped their
[1:33:37] stones, sure, their conscious was, man,
[1:33:39] this guy knows my life. But they are too
[1:33:41] angry. they're too proud to accept the
[1:33:45] fact that, you know, they were wrong and
[1:33:47] and and and he was right. So, it just
[1:33:50] would have produced a resentment and an
[1:33:52] anger and actually a jealousy because
[1:33:55] that religious spirit is always jealous.
[1:33:58] It's never happy for anyone. Cain was
[1:34:01] jealous of Abel. He killed Abel. There's
[1:34:04] jealousy all the way down through the
[1:34:05] scripture. Jealousy is a horrible thing.
[1:34:08] And so these, you know, these these men
[1:34:11] with this religious spirit, all they
[1:34:13] wanted to do was destroy. You even read
[1:34:15] in John chapter 12, Lazarus has been
[1:34:17] raised from the grave and they're
[1:34:20] actually having meetings. How can we
[1:34:21] kill Jesus and Lazarus?
[1:34:24] Crazy. But this is what this spirit
[1:34:26] does. You know, I can see you're all
[1:34:27] listening to me right now. You know,
[1:34:28] they were they they were so angry. This
[1:34:30] is what this jealous religious spirit
[1:34:32] does. Now, this woman would have met
[1:34:34] them in the marketplace. They would have
[1:34:35] bumped into each other and they wouldn't
[1:34:37] have just hung their head in shame and
[1:34:39] walked away. There would have been a
[1:34:40] real hatred against her because here she
[1:34:43] is. She's been forgiven by the Lord. Not
[1:34:46] a prophet, not a priest, but the God
[1:34:48] prophet. Amen. The God who gave the law
[1:34:50] on Sinai was now pronouncing mercy to
[1:34:53] her saying, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:34:55] Go and sin no more." And so she walks
[1:34:57] with this knowledge, the Messiah,
[1:34:58] because she says um she says, "No man,
[1:35:01] Lord." Verse 11, that word Lord means
[1:35:03] supreme one. So she realized the law the
[1:35:06] lawgiver had pronounced her innocent.
[1:35:10] Praise God. So she's carrying this now.
[1:35:13] But you see what happens is a jealous
[1:35:15] spirit will try and make someone feel
[1:35:17] guilty because they're free.
[1:35:20] And so there they would have been angry
[1:35:22] and resentful at her and they would have
[1:35:24] tried to intimidate her to try and stop
[1:35:26] her being happy she had been forgiven.
[1:35:29] What a crazy thing. But this is what the
[1:35:32] spirit does. It doesn't want people It
[1:35:34] doesn't want people to enjoy their
[1:35:36] freedom. Who's ever come in I'm sure
[1:35:38] we've all come in contact with believers
[1:35:40] like that. Sadly, God does something for
[1:35:42] you. God answers a prayer. Maybe a
[1:35:45] family member comes home. Maybe God
[1:35:47] gives a job or finances or whatever
[1:35:49] more. And it's like, where'd that come
[1:35:50] from? Well, it was just God. And you
[1:35:52] feel guilty for actually being happy
[1:35:54] about it and testifying about it because
[1:35:56] a jealous spirit's there against you
[1:36:00] making you feel bad.
[1:36:02] I'm sure we've all been there.
[1:36:06] So this woman,
[1:36:08] no, these men were still trying to
[1:36:10] control her life by their jealousy.
[1:36:16] They wanted her to feel bad that she
[1:36:19] could not enjoy
[1:36:21] what God had done for her.
[1:36:24] And this is what a jealous spirit does.
[1:36:26] It actually makes a person God has
[1:36:28] blessed, touched, changed, provided for
[1:36:30] feel bad. and guilty for what God has
[1:36:33] sovereignly given to them.
[1:36:35] Jealous people are only happy when
[1:36:38] others who are struggling or suffering.
[1:36:42] They are only happy when people are
[1:36:43] basically man their life has gone bad.
[1:36:45] That's a jealous spirit. They're happy
[1:36:46] for those they seem to be so friendly
[1:36:48] and warm because you're suffering. But
[1:36:50] then when God does something for you,
[1:36:52] well that's not fair.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, you think you at least passive
[1:36:56] aggressive kind of barbs come out of
[1:36:58] them instead of just let's rally around
[1:37:00] this and celebrate. Let's be happy God
[1:37:03] did something.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's how I feel. God
[1:37:06] answers prayer. Thank you, Lord. I'm
[1:37:08] happy I can hear this. I'm happy I can
[1:37:10] be part of just enjoy it with you that
[1:37:12] God's done a work. But a jealous person
[1:37:15] is not happy about that. They want
[1:37:17] everyone to be on the same same level.
[1:37:20] So now this woman had a choice.
[1:37:23] She had a choice. You always have two
[1:37:26] choices when a jealous spirit comes
[1:37:27] against you. You can either come under
[1:37:30] the effect of that jealous spirit like
[1:37:33] maybe you know maybe this is just me but
[1:37:36] I just want to put it in. Okay, maybe so
[1:37:38] here's the first scenario. She's at the
[1:37:40] marketplace. She sees the men that
[1:37:41] dragged her to the feet of Jesus and you
[1:37:43] can see they're just angry. They just
[1:37:44] may be staring at her just mad and you
[1:37:47] know and then what does that cause? that
[1:37:49] jealous spirit comes to her and it
[1:37:51] brings into her mind all that she ever
[1:37:52] did. Cuz God allows us to remember. And
[1:37:55] God allows us to remember not to make us
[1:37:58] feel bad, but to to to actually make us
[1:38:00] realize we're not that person anymore.
[1:38:04] That's why the memory can still be there
[1:38:06] as we realize. It's not that you're not
[1:38:07] forgiven or it's not that you're still
[1:38:09] under that. No, it's the fact I was once
[1:38:12] that but now I'm free. Okay. So, she had
[1:38:14] a choice. She could either, you know,
[1:38:16] come under the impact of those memories
[1:38:19] and then what she what and and then what
[1:38:22] she would have done become more
[1:38:24] religious.
[1:38:25] Well, yes, I guess I was that and I've
[1:38:28] got to, you know, these are the
[1:38:30] religious people and they, you know,
[1:38:31] they're angry and I just got to try and
[1:38:34] make a peace. So, I'm just going to come
[1:38:35] under their their anger in a way. I'm
[1:38:38] just become more pious and just, oh yes,
[1:38:40] and this is what I was. And God doesn't
[1:38:43] want us to be like that. God wants us to
[1:38:45] proclaim it. I'm free. I'm free. I'm
[1:38:49] free. Like the soldier boy. You You all
[1:38:52] know that testimony. You know, it was,
[1:38:54] you know, we should we should have such
[1:38:56] a joy. What I was bound in, I've been
[1:38:58] loosed. But that religious spirit tries
[1:39:00] to push a damper and you know, then she
[1:39:02] would have, you know, started going to
[1:39:04] synagogue again, sitting in the back
[1:39:06] because her past and what she did and
[1:39:09] all these things. And what's happened is
[1:39:12] she's become this false contrite
[1:39:14] religious person because of their
[1:39:17] jealousy. So that's the first scenario.
[1:39:19] Can anyone see that? You know, you get
[1:39:22] happy, someone's not happy with you cuz
[1:39:23] you're not cuz they're not enjoying
[1:39:25] victory like you do. You know, you can
[1:39:27] either come under their grumpiness. I'm
[1:39:29] not pointing at you, Josh. I'm just, you
[1:39:30] know,
[1:39:32] not pointing. They say, you know, you
[1:39:34] can either come under their grumpiness
[1:39:35] and say, "Well, I actually shouldn't
[1:39:36] feel happy." or you can be happy.
[1:39:40] So there's the first scenario. The
[1:39:42] second scenario is she's walking with
[1:39:44] the revelation, I'm free and forgiven.
[1:39:46] And then she comes into the marketplace.
[1:39:48] Then she sees these angry men
[1:39:51] and this hatred that she's feeling. And
[1:39:54] so she could either let it rule her or
[1:39:56] she could actually just within herself
[1:39:58] say, "No, I I denounce this in the name
[1:40:00] of Jesus Christ. I'm not going to let
[1:40:03] this thing rule me when the master came
[1:40:05] and set me free.
[1:40:08] Amen. You don't like it. I'm free.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not happy. Tough.
[1:40:16] She She could have said, "Now, that
[1:40:17] doesn't mean you get hard and callous
[1:40:20] because that's another thing the devil
[1:40:21] wants us to become is that we become
[1:40:23] indifferent because we're trying to
[1:40:25] defend ourselves against attacks." No,
[1:40:27] that's that that is not what we should
[1:40:30] do. That's that's the effect of this
[1:40:31] Judas spirit cuz he wants to keep us in
[1:40:34] a way that we're still affected but it's
[1:40:36] just actually just a wall goes up and we
[1:40:38] become hard.
[1:40:41] Thanks be to God. You got to realize who
[1:40:43] freed her. I think it's what she was
[1:40:45] carrying. Jesus freed me. Jesus freed
[1:40:48] me. I was going to die but now I'm
[1:40:50] living. Why am I living? He He allowed
[1:40:52] me to live.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, I don't condemn you. Go
[1:40:55] and sin no more." And something in me
[1:40:57] just said, "This is God
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; talking to me. This is actually the
[1:41:01] heart of God coming to me saying, "No,
[1:41:02] you're free. You don't have to live
[1:41:04] under this." And who cares what the
[1:41:05] religious people do? He cares who cares
[1:41:08] what the religious message people do.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Walk in freedom.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let nothing steal your joy.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; If people are jealous of you, it's not
[1:41:20] your fault.
[1:41:22] Okay? You are not the reason that
[1:41:24] they're jealous. They're jealous because
[1:41:25] they're jealous.
[1:41:27] Okay, all these spirits will come and
[1:41:29] try us, but you got to be able to
[1:41:31] withstand that thing and keep walking in
[1:41:34] the love of the Lord. Okay, I'm nearly
[1:41:36] done.
[1:41:39] Just like there's always a question. Oh,
[1:41:40] wait, wait. We're here. Okay, brother
[1:41:43] Rams asked this question in the lamb and
[1:41:44] the dove. Brother Brandham,
[1:41:48] what's the way back to the oldfashioned
[1:41:49] meetings where you anoint the word for
[1:41:52] what it's about to do? Just become lambs
[1:41:55] again. That's all.
[1:41:57] Just go back to being sheep. The dove
[1:42:00] hasn't gone very far. He's just waiting
[1:42:01] a chance to get back. That's the road
[1:42:04] back to Isusa Street. There's the place
[1:42:06] back. Back to the Isusa Street meetings
[1:42:08] again. Is a return to a lamb nature
[1:42:10] again. That's the only Now, I'm just
[1:42:12] going to put this out there because
[1:42:13] people get offended by some kind of
[1:42:15] quotes like this. Oh, we're not going
[1:42:17] back to Isusa Street. To me, Isusa
[1:42:19] Street was God came and took over the
[1:42:21] people and did what he wanted to do. At
[1:42:24] that time it was a restoration of the
[1:42:25] gifts. Now we have the full word come
[1:42:27] open. Right? So so Isaiah Street before
[1:42:31] it denominated it was God ruling that
[1:42:34] place. Amen. Should it not be the same
[1:42:37] now?
[1:42:39] Don't we want the old-fashioned meetings
[1:42:41] again where God just takes over from the
[1:42:44] pulpit down to the nursery and back into
[1:42:46] the fellowship hall and God just rules.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, what happened in
[1:42:51] church say?" I don't know. I was just so
[1:42:53] lost in his spirit. God just come and
[1:42:54] took over and God just moved and God
[1:42:56] touched me and and sovereignly he healed
[1:42:58] this person and God began to speak to
[1:43:00] lives and people were set free. Who
[1:43:02] wants that?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the road back to this is just
[1:43:06] become a lamb again. So if you're the
[1:43:08] woman who's just being forgiven in John
[1:43:10] 8, don't don't come under a religious
[1:43:13] jealousy and don't come under the fact
[1:43:15] of just being hard against people. Just
[1:43:18] walk in the love of the Lord because
[1:43:19] this is the only condition you can be in
[1:43:22] to walk the old paths. To walk that
[1:43:24] place of a rest for your soul is you
[1:43:26] must be a lamb to walk this old path. I
[1:43:29] mean you cannot be a patched up wolf
[1:43:31] nature. You've got to have a lamb
[1:43:32] nature. It's the only way we can walk
[1:43:35] this path. Why? Because to walk on this
[1:43:37] path is just you and Jesus. And like
[1:43:39] walks with like.
[1:43:42] When I was when I was with Christina and
[1:43:44] we're in the Krueger, I never saw a lion
[1:43:46] sitting down with a zebra and it'd be
[1:43:48] happy. They are different natures. Okay?
[1:43:52] You saw a pride of lions together. You
[1:43:54] saw some giraffes, you saw the hippos,
[1:43:57] you you know, you saw them because they
[1:43:59] are the same nature. Okay? And it's the
[1:44:01] same thing on this old path. It's the
[1:44:03] it's it's you and the Lord and he's the
[1:44:05] lamb of God. Okay? So in order for you
[1:44:08] to walk on this path, we need that same
[1:44:10] nature.
[1:44:12] Amen. And so and what does the
[1:44:14] inoculation, the prescription do? It
[1:44:16] gives you a lamb or a dove nature to
[1:44:19] walk this old path.
[1:44:22] Praise the Lord. Let's have the
[1:44:24] musicians this morning.
[1:44:27] This prescription works if that's all
[1:44:29] you get out of this. And so summary,
[1:44:33] let's just go back to this picture.
[1:44:36] Oh, wait.
[1:44:38] Somehow we'll get technology or I'm just
[1:44:39] driving one screen. Okay. In summary,
[1:44:44] don't let a religious spirit try and
[1:44:47] dampen what you're about to do by
[1:44:49] anoint, you know, by you anointing the
[1:44:51] word for what it's about to do. Don't
[1:44:52] let a Judas rise all this indignation
[1:44:55] and saying, "How dare you?" And we're
[1:44:56] going to keep it all the status quo and
[1:44:58] all these things. Don't let him do that
[1:45:00] to you. Amen. Because Mary to me, she
[1:45:06] was walking.
[1:45:08] Did it again.
[1:45:11] She was walking the good way, the old
[1:45:14] way.
[1:45:17] Stay on that path and have it in your
[1:45:19] heart. Lord, your prescription works.
[1:45:23] The daughters of our people are not
[1:45:25] slightly healed with a false peace. God
[1:45:28] gives a peace that passes all
[1:45:31] understanding. When God heals something,
[1:45:34] it's gone.
[1:45:36] Okay?
[1:45:38] So, don't let
[1:45:41] don't let that kind of religious spirit
[1:45:43] try and stop what God wants you to do,
[1:45:46] which is anoint the word and praise and
[1:45:48] thanksgiving for what he's about to do
[1:45:50] and what he's doing. Okay? So, let's
[1:45:53] stand, shall we, this morning.
[1:45:58] Amen. I got a I got a song here. There's
[1:46:01] a New Testament church rising up. I
[1:46:04] believe we've actually come back to the
[1:46:05] standard.
[1:46:07] I believe personally I believe we've
[1:46:09] come back to the standard of what the
[1:46:11] church was at Pentecost. God and his
[1:46:13] people, right? But we cannot let it
[1:46:16] diminish from that. It should just get
[1:46:17] greater.
[1:46:20] Amen. I trust that's okay. I believe
[1:46:21] we're there. If God's in you, you're
[1:46:23] you're there. Okay. Amen. Let's let's
[1:46:27] give this a go.
[1:46:30] As I look out across the land, I see
[1:46:33] God's mighty hand, the bride of Christ
[1:46:37] adorned in a wedding gown.
[1:46:40] Just like in the days of old, they stood
[1:46:44] in courage
[1:46:46] and turned the whole world upside down.
[1:46:50] Oh, rising up.
[1:46:53] We're rising up.
[1:46:56] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:46:59] up,
[1:47:01] rising up,
[1:47:04] rising up.
[1:47:07] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:47:10] up.
[1:47:12] Now, the Bible plainly tells how the
[1:47:15] Holy Ghost fell. Signs and wonders were
[1:47:19] done by the apostles hands.
[1:47:23] Demon spirits were cast down in the
[1:47:26] jail. This demon shel
[1:47:33] rising up,
[1:47:36] rising up.
[1:47:38] The New Testament church rising up,
[1:47:43] rising up,
[1:47:46] rising up.
[1:47:49] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:47:52] up.
[1:47:54] If you think it's all gone, the days of
[1:47:57] miracles are done. I have some good news
[1:48:02] to bring to you.
[1:48:04] In this last days, God will pour out his
[1:48:08] spirit more and more like a mighty
[1:48:12] strength here with you.
[1:48:15] Rising up.
[1:48:18] Rising up.
[1:48:20] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:48:24] up.
[1:48:26] Rising up.
[1:48:28] Rising up.
[1:48:31] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:48:34] up. Rising up. Rising up.
[1:48:39] Rising up.
[1:48:42] There's a New Testament church rising,
[1:48:47] rising up,
[1:48:49] rising up.
[1:48:52] There's a New Testament. Let's say verse
[1:48:55] one.
[1:48:57] As I look out across the land, I see
[1:49:01] God's mighty hand, the bride of Christ
[1:49:04] adorned in a wedding gown.
[1:49:08] Just like in the days of old, they stood
[1:49:12] in courage bold and turned the world
[1:49:16] upside down. Rising up, rising up,
[1:49:21] rising up.
[1:49:24] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:49:27] up,
[1:49:29] rising up,
[1:49:32] rising up.
[1:49:35] There's a New Testament church rising up
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:41] and plainly saved.
[1:49:44] Holy Ghost fell. Signs and wonders were
[1:49:47] done by the apostles hand.
[1:49:51] Demon spirits were cast out in the jail.
[1:49:54] They sing and shout while surrounded by
[1:49:58] God's holy angel man.
[1:50:01] Oh, rising up.
[1:50:04] We're rising up.
[1:50:07] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:50:10] up.
[1:50:12] Oh, rising up.
[1:50:15] Rising up.
[1:50:17] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:50:21] up.
[1:50:23] If you think it's all long gone, the
[1:50:26] days of miracles are done. I have some
[1:50:30] good news to bring to you.
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:33] In this last days, God will pour out his
[1:50:37] spirit more and more. Like a mighty
[1:50:40] eagle, your strength he'll renew.
[1:50:44] Oh, rising up.
[1:50:46] We're rising up.
[1:50:49] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:50:52] up.
[1:50:54] Oh, rising up.
[1:50:57] Yes, rising up.
[1:51:00] Says the New Testament church rising up.
[1:51:05] We're rising up.

[1:51:25] up.
[1:51:28] Hallelujah. You're rising up. God's
[1:51:31] rise. Who's rising you? God's rising you
[1:51:33] above all principalities, powers,
[1:51:35] demons, and high places. Amen. He's
[1:51:37] placing them under your feet. all
[1:51:39] skepticism, doubt, and all those things
[1:51:41] under your feet in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:51:43] What's he replacing it with? Faith,
[1:51:45] revelation, peace, love, joy. Amen.
[1:51:47] Knowing who you are in this day. Amen.
[1:51:49] Praise God. Amen. Let's bow heads in a
[1:51:51] word of prayer. Amen this morning.
[1:51:54] Hallelujah. Gracious father, we want to
[1:51:56] thank you, Lord. Your prescription
[1:51:58] works. Glory.
[1:52:00] So thankful, my God. Hallelujah, Lord.
[1:52:04] Thank you, Lord. You left us with a
[1:52:05] restored word, with a true message, dear
[1:52:08] God, that gives us the restoration back
[1:52:10] of the right prescription that
[1:52:12] inoculates from sin, from unbelief,
[1:52:15] sorrow. It inoculates from all things,
[1:52:17] my God. We thank you for this, Lord
[1:52:19] Jesus. That truly your word gives us the
[1:52:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Thank you for
[1:52:24] this, my God. I just want to commit
[1:52:25] everyone here into your hands, Lord
[1:52:27] Jesus. Anyone here, Lord God, who has
[1:52:29] not taken that prescription, has not met
[1:52:31] you, my God. Father, I pray you'd stir
[1:52:33] them up, Lord. Father, may you put such
[1:52:35] a longing in their hearts, my God, may
[1:52:37] they not rest until they've given all
[1:52:39] that they are, Lord Jesus, into your
[1:52:40] hands. And may you fill them. May they
[1:52:42] know, Lord, whatever the experience is,
[1:52:44] Lord, that's up to you. But may they
[1:52:45] know that they have been met by the
[1:52:47] master, that the Lord Jesus has changed
[1:52:50] them. And may they see you living in
[1:52:52] their lives in a very real way. Granted,
[1:52:54] dear God, we love you, Lord. We pray
[1:52:56] father you Lord we we would withstand
[1:52:58] every jealous spirit, every religious
[1:53:00] spirit dear God and we would not allow
[1:53:02] it either to make us hard or callous
[1:53:04] against anyone but may we stay as lambs
[1:53:07] Lord Jesus that lamb nature we want to
[1:53:09] see oldfashioned meetings Lord God we
[1:53:11] want to see the power of God move Lord
