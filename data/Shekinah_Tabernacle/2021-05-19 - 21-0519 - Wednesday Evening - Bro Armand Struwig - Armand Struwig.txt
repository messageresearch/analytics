father and every blood lord drop of blood dropped down it was for us for our sins every stripes was for our healing every bruising and chastisement lord was for us lord for that iniquity for everything that we did not deserve lord but lord yet you rich in mercy came lord jesus you paid the ultimate sacrifice father lord to give us a chance lord to be in this life tonight lord as we speak about you lord may you draw near lord thank you so much for a privilege to just share a little bit of a thought in this prayer evening lord and as we go into prayer lord we know that there are needs lord there are very present help lord is you lord and that's the only one we can turn to is our lord jesus christ lord because as brother andy said tonight we come under expectation lord not to hear from man lord not to just have some feebles of man or word of man or doctrines of man lord but to see the living god answer prayer confirm that he's still with us the great i am walk with his people father teach us help us correct us lord that's why we come to your house lord jesus so as a family we can pray together for those that's in need lord lord we don't come here for any other reason than you and if there is any other reason that people are here lord i pray that that would leave them now in the name of jesus christ may nothing stand between your word your kingdom and your holy spirit lord jesus lord because we need ministering to it is a very late hour lord it's a very late hour lord indeed lord eternity and this realm lord this time has merged lord and if we ever knew where we stand right now lord what a people we should be lord lord i pray that you help every one of us lord to receive what you want us to receive let us not get distracted and lord may you speak to each one of us in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen god bless you saints it's wednesday night and we have a prayer meeting um i wanted to make it a circle but with a new cheese and that's so comfy we we couldn't do it but thank you anyway so now we can just preach extra long because you won't get tired i mean let's jump into the scriptures let's go to proverbs and we're going to go to proverbs 16. musicians thank you very much brother marion if you knew how accurate your songs were tonight praise the lord that he goes before the battle before the battle is even fought amen i just want to open up here so we're going to go just want to get to my summer 16 and we're going to start by verse 18. now as we read it i i encourage you if you ever have a bit of time and you ever want to want to get stuck into a book get stuck into the book of proverbs it is a wonderful book to read i think when uh king solomon wrote all these things he knew a couple of things they and when you see these these revelations it is more than just the words on print because while you read it search your heart see if you line up with some of these things that's there and then speak to god about it amen so let's start it verse 18 it says pride goeth before destruction and haughty spirit before the fall so means for anyone that doesn't know it's a pride spirit a uplifted spirit somebody that that exalts him above anyone else pretty much like satan did when he was still in heaven he exalted him he had a haughty heart he he wanted to be as the most high so that that heart that is the holy spirit before the fall better it is to be in humble spirit which is lowly then to divide the spoil with the proud how many times do we find ourselves mixing with the proud instead of standing away from the proud because it's nice if you if your team wins and we're all celebrating it's all good but a humble spirit would be thankful for anything that happens now i'm just like taking taking a normal let's say a rugby game or a soccer game or anything it's easy when everybody is all oh we want you one and in the next game oh we won we unbeatable and then that spirit quickly becomes something which is not actually going to add anything to your faith you're not going to get better because you thought you made it already so be careful of this spirit the spirit of proudness the spirit of exalting yourself of thinking even in the truth that you're something any other than anybody else keep humble stay on your knees it's so important it's not a part of the message but it is so important that all of us keep searching our hearts and saying lord am i actually in your love am i in that love that agape love that you have am i in there search your hearts me as well when i read this it brought a big rebuke on my life to say are you actively searching god's love and favor in humbleness the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of thy lip increases learning understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that have it so understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that have it but the instruction of fools is folly how many times do we listen to other people instead of just reading our bibles the heart of the wise teaches his mouth an ad of learning to his lips pleasant words are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones a merry heart brother ben said tonight praying of joy there is a way that seemeth right unto a man and the end thereof is the ways of death as much as we reason as much as we justify as much as we think we're anything the way that seemeth right unto a man is the end thereof is the ways of death the bible says seek your salvation with fear and trembling and i think we should do that he that laboreth laboreth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is a burning fire amen may the lord bless this word you're on my seat and it's not a heavy sermon at all the reason why i read this is because we need to find a place where we get where god can start speaking to us you have to if you read your bible and you just read it as a couple of words on the page god's not speaking to you so sometimes correction is good and sometimes when god corrects you share it with others and that's what i'm doing tonight okay i'm gonna share a bit of of what the lord is doing not just in my life but how he's teaching me to be more like him amen amen so when we and i'm not going to be long tonight when we look at a life of a christian where do we find our example where's our example how should a christian live how do i overcome why do i keep failing and falling in the same traps why is the devil always against me when i try to do good there's all these wonderful questions that christians ask and there's no answers that can come from a man it has to come out of here it has to come out of here because when god speaks through his word and it gets confirmed then that is a finished work because it says my word will not return to me void so he says whatever you reach whatever starts knocking in your heart i am busy talking to you my child pay attention but how many times do we hear the words we see it we read it it comes over the pulpit and yet we're lazy to respond we're lazy to respond because god gives you warning and warning and warning and then he says now i have to correct you and because he's a gracious god he gives you the choice what your correction will be because remember you reap what you sow and the most powerful tool that we as a christian here they have that can bring life and death is this thing the tongue the mouth and he says you speak with your mouth you speak with your mouth you you don't honor me with your lips your tongue is so deceitful so deceitful and it could bring healing and it could bring death so we must watch every word we say it's not even sermon we we're about to to go into the heavenlies with the lord where he gives us the overcoming power but just just as a basis there is a time where god has to absolutely take you and just say hey wake up it's later than you think and what you say has the effect on people and what you do can cost someone their salvation and even your conduct in church i will deal with you my son and my daughter and god does not let his sons and daughter get away with that if you read the old testament and you read the new testament if david fell and he did something wrong god dealt with it when moses did something wrong god dealt with it sin is dealt with and the wonderful thing is the wages of sin is death so now i'm saying i'm a sinner lord i made a mistake so the thing that has to fall on me now is death because god don't sit in his word and don't keep it but how did i bypass and got grace how did that happen how did all of a sudden from a death sentence to the grave that i get mercy and now i'm white as snow how did that happen and we sang it tonight and we're going to read it now amen let's go to john 19. see all the things that we we talk about it's it sounds heavy but actually it is just god revealing more and more of himself to us to show us that there is a way that we can overcome there is a way that you can find your answer and it's in the word of god but are you seeking it or are you looking for excuses how many times have you reasoned above reasoning let's go to verse 31 please say um talia how many times has god corrected us so john 19 and verse 31. okay so before we jump into there i want you to now go and think how do i overcome how do i get into the rapture how do i even deserve this and what is my purpose here what is my purpose here am i just going to be every wednesday night in church am i just going to be every sunday at church is it going to become a habit is it going to become a religion why are we here it is a good question why and if you cannot answer it tonight i i encourage you to open your ears because he says he that have a ear led him but let him not he that every year let him just go past hear what he's saying he's speaking to you young and old if you don't understand the why you are here i promise you the lord has his answer tonight just listen jesus therefore because it was the um it was the preparation the jews therefore because it was the preparation so that preparation the word when you go into the strong concordance is the day of getting ready for the sabbath that's what preparation means so they were preparing for the day of sabbath he says that the body should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for the sabbath day was the an high day the sword pilate that their legs might be broken and they might be taken away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first that's the thief and then of the other which was crucified with him so both thieves got their legs broken but when they came to jesus and saw that it was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and our prophet says jesus christ the nails in his hands it's not what killed him the loss of blood when they whipped him it's not what killed him it was a broken heart because he came to his own and his own received him not so the jews knew jesus was the messiah there was no doubt about it the the word said the virgin shall conceive their very bible said and we went into the bible study as well said he'll be hung between malfectus they said you'll be buried between the rich they said he he'll be on the cross and david said my god my god why have they forsaken me my bones stare at me they knew he was going to be naked all the prophecies that was there they knew it was him this was not done in a secret place this was not done in the secret and the very pharisees and sachses that knew the word more than anyone else crucified him that day but it had to happen it had to happen but see now jesus dies for us and here he uses the example so now you're in church we get striving we get people that don't agree with each other we get sometimes i just don't understand some things and we even look out at the people outside and say lord there's no grace for them because this world is so dark and so evil but where is the heart of christ where is this heart that was hanging upon a cross looking at the very people he came to save they crucify him and he dies because his heart is broken because they cannot see the truth in that very present day because there's some issue or some stronghold and some form of pride because they had to deny themselves to receive christ that was blocking them from receiving it how many times do we sit and we know that the lord is busy talking to you busy talking to you and you make it like this definitely he's preaching there oh yeah i know that he's preaching there now come on you cannot do that you must take every word on for yourself god don't come and preach here over a pulpit to correct your brother it's for you and if you are doing this then you're actually missing what the lord is telling you so it says like this look at this life look his prophecies was there it was all talking about himself now he overcame because before he died on the cross before he died on that cross he had to overcome himself because when the cup was then he was praying and he said lord let this cup depart from me but if not thy will be done so he had to forsake himself he had to get to such a place that he consider himself nothing now how can we as a church move on with god if we ever are something we cannot we cannot brother ben preached about the foot wash flunky he was prepared here comes jesus's feet he can wash it he had a chance of everything and he chose to look at this one because if this one does it then i won't do it then this one will do it and and it kind of struck me and said lord what am i doing at this very moment is it actually furthering your kingdom am i humble am i low am i meek or am i getting heavy high minded and full of anything and if it is so correct me lord help me because i'm going in a rapture if i take those baggage and body and all these other things with me i cannot overcome my enemy if my enemy is playing mind games in my head the whole time i cannot overcome so we have to be in the spirit of christ and he says here now we use the the the example of stephen and he says the prophet says here like your fathers did also so you do he says he was god's advertisement board stephen and when they stoned him to death throwed him outside in the city and beat him to death with stones when he was dying he raised his head to heaven and he asked forgiveness and for those who were stoning him the same as jesus did at the cross the life of christ say lord i got it wrong forgive me they got it wrong forgive them the heart of the christian is not anything for ourselves it's all for him no matter how right stephen was every word he preached on that day was thus say of the lord it was correct hundred percent and here he finds himself outside a city on his knees and they throwing him with stones he's brothers and sisters and what is his attitude towards them forgive them as jesus forgave me because he wasn't preaching anything else but what was in this word and it goes on and it says then god seen a little advertisement board taking being taken down stephen looked up at heaven and said behold i see heavens open and jesus standing on the right hand of god and he fell asleep in the arms of god and he was an advertisement board for a hungry world you say well how many was there you say that there was maybe five thousand how many got saved there was one one the greatest sacrifice this man could give his own life stephen saved one life started the journey for one person for saul because who was holding the coat while they were doing it and who was looking at this man is saying something here is different because there must have been something because jesus said when he was persecuting me and the light struck him he said you're kicking against the prick so somewhere inside there was already a battle going and he was just pushing that down because he thought in his doctrine and his learning and his experience that he was right so he was sure that the words and doctrines of men kept him so right that when when this confrontation and he saw jesus stephen dying there and something started pricking and saying something's going on here you're missing something he did not walk away from that thing all being oh yes someone died today you cannot tell me that because why did jesus say why persecute the persecutors thou me and it's hard to kick against the pricks what was preaching this man's life what was in him what was first he said but this guy is different and these guys want to kill and and but no i'm strong in the faith and i'm a pharisee of the pharisees and because there was a battle raging inside but see god knew when to step on that scene and it's the same with each one of us the same example applied to our lives every day we get to a stage where we have to sacrifice and get down on my knees and say lord you just let the stones fall and kill that old nature and if i can kill that old nature and it can bring one person into the world one person into the presence of god isn't that what it's worth isn't that what it's worth what are we here for to be an advertisement board to be a time-tested memorial no matter how bad it is no matter how good it is to stay with the word and to stay at a posted duty and admit when you're wrong he says well he never accepted it then but years later there was one help the coat saul a young pharisee standing there consulted and gave a witness of his death but when he saw the advertisement and the power of the resurrection the resurrected christ in that little fellow he never got away from him the same man paul the one standing there led tens and thousands of souls to christ because one man was willing to give his life to be advertisement board for christ what order we do today now i'm going to ask the kids a question children raise your hands if you know well what do you see here rebecca a white dot okay this is gonna be this is this is a tough one okay jonathan a black dot okay this is there's something to it what do you see now liam nothing a white paper see there's something you all missed this is a black paper with a white dot this is a white paper with a black dot and this is a white paper this is before i met the lord i was always a part of god no matter how dark in sin i was he was there because he said if you're my seed i'll never lose you so that nothing that i was there was god in it now he's busy changing my life and now i've got a lot of good things but people keep seeing that little black dot huh they keep seeing this little stupid black dot when everything else i do is for him but what does god see what does god see what are we supposed to see the sin the sinner or god what is the viewpoint of a christian the black dot is it so far that jesus would die on a cross so that we can still see a black dot when he sees this who has the right to pull any sin out of the blood of jesus christ if that man has a right stand no one can take the blood that i've put under the blood of jesus christ and attributed to me doesn't work that way god sees me as this and every time i fail and i repent and i say lord man the blood of jesus christ cleans me he sees me as this for i never did it in the first place so why don't we as a church stop seeing this start seeing this because isn't this the very mind of christ isn't this why he died for all sin not some of it but all i didn't come here to play church i came here because he gave me from this and he's busy with this and he sees me here that's why we're here you don't come to church to warm up you you come at church too so god can work on this because he sees you as this so i want to write a word here because this is what i firmly believe you are a whip this is what i believe we are a whip because they hit him with that whip with the four strains and the wire on it they they carved up his back we ever watched the movie passion of christ when they hit that man and you could see the the the deep wounds on his back satan was laughing because he got to whip the lord jesus christ but see what this stands for as a work healing in progress all of us is a work and a healing in progress because when we were walking here there was a lot of hurts there was a lot of things that happened in our life and it was a lot of things that made us the way we made and that's fine that's history but we are a whip and what means is we see each one of us as something that was there to put against our enemy to show that we have overcoming power god didn't make a bride in this age to fall you know you're all going in a rapture hey i'm sure you know we're all going in the rapture you cannot go into a rapture by by the way with this little dot on you because god is going to take the holy spirit off this ground and the holy spirit don't have any dots on it this is the holy spirit okay so just think about this when you look at your brother and sister think of them as a whip for the enemy's back because he had his chance to whip the lord jesus christ but our god don't work like that he said i will bring forth a bride in such a way that you will not know what to do with her if you come with temptation she will deny you if you come with malice and strife she will walk away she will pray before she walks she will pray before she talks she will pray before she does anything because she does not want you to rule over her because he cannot rule over you because you're this so just remember as much as we look at each other never ever ever ever ever see the sin because you cut the influence of a brother and sister off none of us are perfect yet god sees us perfect but we are walking we are all work in progress and healing takes time healing takes time these things still now in my life where i haven't found healing from because when i was back in the world i opened myself up to become this so i pray and i encourage you before we pray tonight why don't you seek your heart in front of the holy god that is pure and it's deity and say lord if there is anything that's in my heart that could cause me not to see someone as a finnish work of god remove it in the name of jesus christ because we didn't come here to play church and i cannot correct you is what the lord gave me it says in ephesians he says ephesians 6 13 it says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god this is good in your fight he says that ye may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand the man that knows that the lord is leading him must stand where the lord has placed him don't worry about the scoffers there's enough of them stephen didn't worry about who stoned him jesus didn't worry about who crucified him noah didn't worry about who was telling and mocking him when he's building the boat okay moses didn't listen to quran nathan yet he was still crying out for them when god wanted to swallow them up the whole thing is you don't need to do anything else but surrender and just let god live don't ever take a sermon over the pulpit as something otherwise as personal to you don't it's the biggest mistake we can do when we say brother ben is speaking to that brother and that that system oh i feel it's a bit more there and don't do that because you actually then causing that person not to be a whip you're cutting off that testimony that that highest for you no one else only you we cannot do it so when you pray i used to lie and i said to to the kids and i hate to confess it and i'll finish with this long time ago i said that a spite it was the hardest thing i ever done okay i said when i used to do rollerblades i used to ride down the hills and then i'll and i could do it but what happens is you'll lean down on on your back wheel on your front wheels like this going down the hill and then i'll go under a truck and through the trailer but i lied so i was sharing this in a bible study with the children and i walked out and i kind of felt a bit oh i shared something there you know and then the lord corrected me straight after that says what if a child goes and does that and ends up under that truck because you has lied so the next two weeks i was fighting this thing it was the biggest thing because i had to go back into the class and tell the kids and he said to me you will go back and you will tell them you lied now if you know kids they think you're a hero when you cool and now all of a sudden in this cool year of struts in the class and he goes hey kids i've got something to tell you i lied and they're like why would you lie to us he was like so super cool and now you lied to us but i did and because i'm telling you i lied to you is because if i made a mistake and i said i'm sorry the lord forgives me but i need to tell you guys as well i made a mistake because if you see me without sin and you ever sin what example was i to you i said and heaven forbid that any one of you would ever try something i tell you in a lie and you get hurt that will forever be on my head because i couldn't speak one word of truth and that is why the devil hates a liar so when you pray for people pray in sincerity when you look at people see work in progress am i raptured no i'm not is anyone else for us in the environment yet no are we still going to make mistake is there trials coming yes that's right okay am i going to be that annoying guy with a big nose yes okay i can't help it because some things in trades in my life god's still dealing with but i ain't there yet but god sees me as this so you have no right to see me any other way hallelujah no other way and so me you and so when god corrected me this week i went back on my knees and said lord you know what think somewhere i left that place and when i read what he did for me and on calvary when brother branham preached that cross and he said that he died from a broken heart a broken heart i thought man why the games am i playing say lord forgive me and you know what somebody that can go to the lord and say sorry forgive me lord loves that man's heart and he can walk with a man like that though he corrects him so we've got a couple of pre-requests amen i just want to go into prayer i don't feel we we have to mock about what time sister disa she she um is asking for prayer now she couldn't make it tonight she's got something i think a foot or a toe got hurt and and she really got hurt so um and she's also asking for pray for her husband steve that he that he would receive the holy ghost because see the heart of the christian is we just want them there we just want everyone there everyone that's our heart so yeah if there's any other pre-requests um feel free to raise your hand and speak them we can pray and we all just pray because it's a premium i don't want to take so long i'm sorry but it's hard when you start talking about the lord you
