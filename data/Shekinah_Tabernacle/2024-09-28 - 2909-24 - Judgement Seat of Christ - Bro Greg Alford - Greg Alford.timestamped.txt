[31:08] run out of steam but you guys are fresh
[31:11] at it so you you can come down and teach
[31:12] us a few
[31:14] things and uh certainly good to catch up
[31:16] with friends I hadn't met and became new
[31:19] friends and for those of you who have
[31:21] known for
[31:23] years and uh
[31:25] Linley she's well she goes way way
[31:28] back yeah sh don't tell how long Okay
[31:32] and we're just glad to see too that your
[31:35] church is
[31:38] normal right I like it yeah yeah because
[31:41] you know you preach a sermon like that
[31:44] and you think somebody's mad at you they
[31:45] don't show up for the next one and now
[31:47] I'm going to show them how they can get
[31:49] there right and then now they don't want
[31:51] to learn how they get there okay well
[31:53] but uh we know people have commitments
[31:55] and different things and we understand
[31:57] that and yeah I vowed never to go onto
[32:00] the online but I've done that and um but
[32:03] yeah we still isolate ourselves because
[32:06] you 40 years ago God called me and uh we
[32:11] were driving home one night and we'd
[32:13] been going in the town for six years to
[32:15] a church there mess's church and we're
[32:17] driving home one night and I've been
[32:19] seeking God because I knew I had a gift
[32:21] I knew I God wanted me to do something I
[32:23] didn't know how it was going to happen
[32:25] we did all sorts of things we did the
[32:26] airplane of Lind remember that we flew
[32:28] into the paddock next to lindley's place
[32:31] or in the Fielding or Lavin area and
[32:34] preached there we went into Wellington
[32:36] we preached here we went up to terango
[32:38] oh we we went all over the place and
[32:41] because I thought well maybe he wants an
[32:43] itinerate Ministry out of me and so I
[32:44] thought I'd do that and uh we got home
[32:47] and we barely paid the bill for the
[32:49] airplane for the two weeks we were away
[32:51] so I knew that wasn't right I had a
[32:52] young family I couldn't do that and live
[32:55] and then coming home one night
[32:58] this little church has been sitting
[33:00] there for over a hundred years God said
[33:02] there's your building I turned around
[33:04] now our sons one of the boys maybe one
[33:08] you have one of these kids one of the
[33:09] boys was he wore his heart on his
[33:12] sleeve so he didn't think too much of
[33:16] what he was going to say he just said
[33:18] it so he was sleeping in the because he
[33:21] had an old HQ helden station wagon he
[33:23] was sleeping in the back as we were on
[33:25] the back seat anyway and we pulled into
[33:28] the thing he goes Dad where are you
[33:31] going I said God's just spoke to me he
[33:33] says all
[33:36] right all he wanted to do was go home
[33:38] and go to bed right because we were an
[33:41] hour out of Christ Church and so uh I
[33:44] pulled in there to the old church the
[33:46] sign was laying in the grass it's uh was
[33:50] built in8
[33:52] 1899 I lifted it up it said Methodist
[33:55] church so I went and I got a hold of the
[33:58] Methodist Minister that lives in rura
[34:01] and I said I want to use your church for
[34:02] an Outreach and so that's how it all
[34:04] started but you know I knew God had
[34:06] called me there and he made a way now
[34:09] let me just give you a short testimony
[34:10] with
[34:11] this so we were in that church for 25
[34:16] years we had 11 people when it came time
[34:19] to buy the church because they offered
[34:21] it for sale after almost nine years they
[34:24] offered it for sale to us you guys are
[34:27] thinking of
[34:28] building
[34:30] $20,000 was all we could scrape
[34:33] together and so we did we put an offer
[34:36] in for
[34:39] $220,000 the circuit writer Methodist
[34:41] circuit riter accountant says to little
[34:45] or 17 we offered him 17 we had 20 he
[34:48] said go up a little bit higher so we we
[34:50] went to 20 he said I think they'll take
[34:52] it they took it we went in to sign the
[34:55] papers over put the trustees and
[34:56] everything down for the new building a
[34:59] 100-year old building and he said
[35:03] Somebody's Watching Over You because
[35:05] that day that we signed it they just got
[35:07] a new GV of
[35:11] $31,000 and all we had was 20 and we
[35:14] bought that thing for 20,000 we were
[35:16] there for 25
[35:18] years
[35:20] amen that's God
[35:24] right for 25 years we were there so we
[35:27] went into Kaio then because our church
[35:29] had grown so much and it was on the main
[35:31] road and it was 100K going by the church
[35:34] and we had young kids we had old people
[35:36] and and I just I just thought somebody's
[35:38] going to get hit here so we started we
[35:42] made our way into Kaio and looked around
[35:44] God gave us a building there in Kaio we
[35:46] purchased
[35:48] it we purchased it for 385 385,000 and
[35:54] uh and we never had insurance but we had
[35:57] to to have insurance now because we had
[35:58] a building you couldn't insure the other
[36:00] one it was too old if the fire got
[36:02] started it would burned down before they
[36:03] got the fire engines there right in the
[36:05] country so we have got an insurance on
[36:08] it we paid Insurance $2,500 a year for
[36:11] insurance for two years the earthquake
[36:14] came just after we put all the money
[36:15] into it built it up got it going some of
[36:18] you may even have been there for the
[36:20] dedication and it went
[36:24] down we got back 485,000
[36:30] we then uh went ahead and put another
[36:34] 70,000 in it to make it right our latest
[36:38] GV 2.9 Million
[36:42] amen we're debt-free
[36:49] now we we no longer have earthquake
[36:52] insurance because it's too expensive
[36:55] it's five grand just for what we had for
[36:57] 2 and a half thousand has jumped to 5
[36:59] grand a year so we're taking any extra
[37:02] money we got we're putting it away
[37:04] should there be another
[37:07] earthquake and to doubly seal that when
[37:11] we built the building the brothers
[37:12] poured the foundation and we poured the
[37:15] foundation it was supposed to be 70 MERS
[37:17] of concrete going into the floor with
[37:19] the floating rib
[37:22] Foundation when we finished we had 104
[37:25] square meters of concrete go into the
[37:28] floor it is valued or it is rated at a
[37:31] 9-point earthquake will withstand the
[37:34] 9-point earthquake W so hey we're
[37:40] set and we're almost so we're just
[37:44] thankful that God has been so faithful
[37:46] to us over the years right just started
[37:48] off very simple so have courage believe
[37:51] God and no telling what he might do for
[37:54] you I know you're not going to get a
[37:55] building for 20 grand I I I realize that
[37:59] but uh you know have believe in God
[38:02] right okay let's uh let's go to our
[38:04] Bibles tonight and let's go in chapter
[38:08] two or um 2 Chronicles 510 and just kind
[38:12] of sort
[38:14] of bring out what we started
[38:18] with um in the Judgment seat because we
[38:22] talked to you about not size and thing
[38:24] we'll we'll kind of just do a brief
[38:25] overlay and then and and bring you up to
[38:28] Spade so that we actually see where the
[38:31] reward
[38:35] is okay 2 Corinthians 5:10 for we all
[38:40] must appear before the Judgment seat of
[38:42] Christ that everyone may receive the
[38:45] things done in his body according that
[38:49] he hath done whether it be good or bad
[38:54] let's pray together Heavenly Father we
[38:57] ask you to help us now as we want to
[38:58] deliver this Lord Jesus we're thankful
[39:01] for the wonderful time we've had we
[39:03] thankful for the Sisters here that have
[39:06] provided such a wonderful lunch and
[39:07] brother Bon's invitation we ask you to
[39:09] bless this church mightily for we ask it
[39:12] in Jesus mighty name bless your word now
[39:14] as we begin to minister it in jesus'
[39:16] name amen God bless you may be
[39:19] seated
[39:21] so if we don't get to the Judgment bar
[39:25] or the Judgment seat of Christ
[39:28] we end up in the the Lake of Fire so
[39:30] let's let's just briefly go
[39:33] through uh let's see if I get
[39:36] control yeah it's thinking about it come
[39:39] on
[39:40] baby don't want to lose my
[39:45] anointing it's got the ghost
[39:48] lows move move the okay yeah let's see
[39:52] if I can get right so here's where we
[39:56] left off right we are the three-fold
[39:58] Judgment of every believer every
[40:00] believer has got to go through this
[40:01] right everyone's got so there comes a
[40:03] time when you give your life to Christ
[40:05] and because he's given your life to
[40:07] Christ and he has taken our sin then our
[40:11] judgment is passed I no longer stand
[40:13] before him as a sinner that don't mean I
[40:16] don't get changed but it just means my
[40:18] sin question is dealt with that's right
[40:21] then we go to the next thought which is
[40:23] we're judged as a son and when we're
[40:26] judged as a son now now we see that it's
[40:30] the present day and we see that it's a
[40:34] repentance a confession and a
[40:37] chastisement and the chastisement is
[40:39] because he's trying to get us he brings
[40:42] something to mind and you don't pay
[40:45] attention amen oh me right amen or ow me
[40:50] one or the other you you finally realize
[40:53] okay amen or ow me oh my I'm in trouble
[40:56] so we see then that it it brings you to
[40:59] a place of chastisement and chastisement
[41:02] isn't because he doesn't love you it is
[41:04] because he loves you so the mere fact
[41:07] that he wants to correct you you should
[41:09] go thank you Jesus amen he wants to
[41:12] correct you and you need to take that
[41:14] correction because he's trying to show
[41:16] it to you and so he he we take that
[41:19] correction right and then the next one
[41:22] is we is are we are judged as a a
[41:24] servant which is a future we learned so
[41:27] let's go through that just briefly again
[41:30] 1 Corinthians 3:1 the
[41:33] foundation for another Foundation can no
[41:36] man lay than that which is laid which is
[41:39] Jesus Christ so if your foundation is
[41:42] solid in Christ it's going to stand amen
[41:47] and that's how the foolish Church gets
[41:50] to the other side right now they may
[41:53] have a right they have a good foundation
[41:55] but they may not have a right baptism
[41:57] right so they're not going to get the
[41:58] wedding garment so you know there's
[42:00] different things that would not would
[42:03] eliminate them from going further but if
[42:05] their Foundation is
[42:06] true because you there are some genuine
[42:09] Christians out there who don't believe
[42:11] the message yeah right
[42:14] yeah okay let's go a little further
[42:18] then uh verse 12 now if any man build
[42:21] upon this Foundation gold silver
[42:23] precious stones hay or wood hay stubble
[42:27] so we realize then that these six things
[42:29] that we have ability to build upon are
[42:32] all dealing with how we live our
[42:35] Christian Life and if I'm going to live
[42:37] it for the glory of God I'm going to
[42:40] build it with precious things rather
[42:42] than wood hay and stubble because we
[42:44] know the fire we see here is going to
[42:47] try it so we go to the next verse for
[42:51] every man's work shall be made manifest
[42:53] for the day shall declare it because it
[42:54] shall be revealed by fire and and the
[42:57] fire shall try every man's work what
[43:00] sort it is and if any man's work abide
[43:04] which he hath built thereupon he shall
[43:06] receive a reward but if any man's work
[43:08] shall be burned up he shall suffer loss
[43:11] but he himself shall be saved yet so by
[43:14] fire so why is he saved his
[43:18] foundation his foundation was correct
[43:21] now what he built on was not correct and
[43:24] so the fire is going to check that and
[43:26] it's going to burn turn that up and he's
[43:28] going to suffer loss but he himself will
[43:31] be saved that's why when you go to
[43:33] Revelation
[43:34] 7:14 where you see that who are these
[43:37] These are they who have come out of
[43:38] Great Tribulation and made their robes
[43:40] white in the blood of the lamb and
[43:42] they're Before the Throne of God day and
[43:44] night and they serve
[43:45] him
[43:47] right
[43:49] now if you go before the seals into the
[43:52] church age
[43:53] Book You'll see brother brandham said
[43:55] that was the bride
[43:58] but this before the
[44:00] seals and then after the seals he
[44:02] realizes they are serving God where the
[44:05] bride rules and reigns with God right so
[44:08] there were two different classes and so
[44:10] that's why it's so important that when
[44:12] you build a Doctrine in the message you
[44:14] got to make it fit the old old where he
[44:16] was at that time versus where he came to
[44:19] after the Book of Revelations because
[44:22] now the book has been open yeah and when
[44:24] the book was open now the revelation
[44:27] comes so that brother brandham could
[44:28] correct what was wrong yeah and he made
[44:31] it right so now we have and you know I
[44:34] did that to my
[44:36] church because you know sometimes when
[44:39] you preach so long at one place they
[44:42] kind of go to sleep on
[44:43] you so I said see brother Bram said
[44:46] that's and they all knew it was wrong
[44:48] and they're all going he's gone off the
[44:51] rails again
[44:53] Bo and I says okay what's the difference
[44:56] and and then one guy say oh it's prior
[44:58] to seals right
[45:00] exactly so we know then that we compare
[45:04] what was preached before the seals
[45:05] compared to what was preached after the
[45:07] seals so we get the balance on where
[45:09] he's at because brother brandham grew in
[45:11] his understanding that's right right if
[45:13] you remember the first seal he said in
[45:15] the first seal he says he he wrote it
[45:17] all out figured out all what it was
[45:19] supposed to be and then the angel came
[45:21] said you're wrong here here here
[45:24] corrected here here here why because now
[45:27] he's opening the word to the prophet
[45:30] that's right which you know I believe
[45:31] brother brandom studied hard to figure
[45:33] out what it was but that was all he had
[45:35] a
[45:36] revelation just for an exercise for you
[45:38] go go to Google not I'm not trying to
[45:41] get you to be a Google light but go to
[45:44] Google and put in seven seal chart there
[45:48] is a myriad of seven seal charts and
[45:50] none of them match brother brandom's
[45:52] teaching none of them and they're all
[45:55] over the show
[45:57] the Mormons felt he would come in 1911
[46:00] well they missed that one that's right
[46:02] so you know there's just so much that we
[46:04] we are so thankful for and we'll get
[46:06] into that in a few moments because of
[46:08] God opening the word to our
[46:10] understanding okay so we see here that
[46:13] it's going to be it's going to be
[46:15] service which is works and it's also
[46:18] going to be sort not size and that's
[46:22] important and we're going to show you
[46:23] that as we go down
[46:25] through okay let's go to the next next
[46:27] slide here
[46:29] then and as we go to the next slide
[46:31] Jesus tells us here to lay ourselves up
[46:33] in Treasure in heaven right so in
[46:36] Matthew 6: 19 Jesus says lay not up for
[46:40] yourself treasure upon Earth where moth
[46:42] and rust do corrupt but where thieves
[46:44] break through to steal but lay up for
[46:47] yourselves treasure in heaven where
[46:50] neither moth nor rust death corrupt
[46:52] where neither where thieves do not break
[46:56] through
[46:57] nor steal for where your treasure is
[47:00] there will your heart
[47:01] be so what are we talking about what
[47:04] treasure are we talking about how do we
[47:07] know what the treasure is is it an
[47:09] Earthly
[47:11] treasure it's got to be a spiritual
[47:13] thing doesn't it but what would be the
[47:15] treasure how can I know that there's
[47:18] going to be something
[47:19] there how can I be sure that when I get
[47:22] there it hasn't been in
[47:24] vain right I don't want to get there and
[47:27] go well you did a great job but depart
[47:30] from me you workers of iniquity I never
[47:32] knew you because there'll be many people
[47:34] like that we prophesied your name we
[47:37] done wonderful works in your name he
[47:39] said I don't know you why because they
[47:41] didn't do it the right way not that they
[47:44] didn't do it they did it but they did it
[47:46] the wrong way so we need to know what
[47:48] what treasure am I going to have there
[47:50] how do I get this treasure if it's not
[47:52] Earthly treasure what is it
[48:01] so one of the first ones we see here
[48:04] then is that it's really dealing
[48:08] with uh the treasure in uh what have I
[48:14] got here our treasure okay it's dealing
[48:17] when Hebrews 6 verse 10 for God is Not
[48:22] unrighteous to forget your Works your
[48:24] labor of love which ye have shed toward
[48:28] his name in that he ministered to the
[48:31] Saints and do minister so God pays
[48:34] attention to everything you do for the
[48:36] Kingdom right that's where your treasure
[48:38] comes is doing for the kingdom and this
[48:41] is so hard uh for us to get to a place
[48:44] to well is this Kingdom stuff or is this
[48:46] just
[48:47] me and and we see then as we as we think
[48:50] about this thought the Bible says and I
[48:53] thought let me see if I can go back one
[48:55] because I look
[48:57] oh can you give
[48:58] me can you move my mouse and give it
[49:01] back to the pre previous one right there
[49:05] good okay here's what brother Bram says
[49:08] here I must have skipped that
[49:10] slide all too little time is spent on
[49:12] laboring for Eternal rewards of God all
[49:15] too little time is spent notice little
[49:18] time is
[49:19] spent for Eternal rewards the recompense
[49:23] of God is to lightly esteemed
[49:28] so we're not pushing enough on what the
[49:30] rewards are we're pushing more on being
[49:32] right with God but what are the rewards
[49:35] are then he goes
[49:37] on if we believe in the reality of the
[49:40] resurrection of the body and the Eternal
[49:44] Kingdom of the of the
[49:47] substance then we ought to lay up in
[49:50] heaven those good Treasures that are
[49:54] available for the faithful Saints
[49:58] now when you look at that thought then
[50:00] what would those treasures
[50:02] be let's go to Matthew 16 verse 27 stay
[50:06] with me on this one so in Matthew 16:27
[50:10] he
[50:13] says he says to him there he says for
[50:15] the son of man shall come in his glory
[50:17] of his father with his Holy
[50:20] Angels then he shall reward every man
[50:23] according to his
[50:25] works so the reward comes when he comes
[50:29] so what's the reward going to be well
[50:32] let's look at a little bit fether
[50:34] differently then so Revelations 22 at
[50:36] the very last chapter of the Bible it
[50:38] says behold I come quickly my reward is
[50:41] with me to give to every man according
[50:43] to his Works shall be so once again he
[50:46] in Matthew he talks about a reward in
[50:49] the Book of Revelations he talks about a
[50:50] reward so how do I get to the place of
[50:53] reward so who are the Sunday School
[50:55] teachers here
[50:57] huh you a Sunday school teacher you a
[50:59] Sunday school teacher so how do you
[51:02] reward your children for do you do
[51:04] memory memorization of scripture Memory
[51:08] verses huh yeah okay so what do you do
[51:10] to give a reward for your children a
[51:12] star their name on the board something
[51:16] huh a what a
[51:22] sweet kids are going to have bad teeth
[51:27] but you know we we it we humanly give
[51:29] rewards for when things are
[51:32] done that's why the Bible talks about it
[51:35] because only things that we do here on
[51:37] Earth are what really are going to be
[51:39] rewarded in heaven why do you think we
[51:41] have S and Dames and that sort of stuff
[51:43] it's all a pattern of what is going to
[51:46] happen in the
[51:47] heavens and when brother brandom stepped
[51:49] forward he they you know he was so
[51:51] humble he says well these can't be
[51:53] brandom no it's your converts
[51:56] right it's for the work you did it's not
[51:58] because of who you are it's for what you
[52:01] did for the
[52:02] Kingdom so we we see here now that we
[52:05] want to C well what how do I know what I
[52:07] supposed to do well that's where we have
[52:10] to count on what God says to do so the
[52:13] Old Testament for uh our our Testament
[52:17] of to other people should be that we
[52:19] serve whoever it is
[52:22] right like the man who was caught there
[52:24] in the on the the way to Jericho and all
[52:28] the religious guys passed him by but the
[52:30] Samaritan went and and helped him out so
[52:33] he was the one that Jesus spotted on
[52:35] that would get a reward because he did
[52:37] the right thing and so that's where I
[52:40] gave you the scripture now go with me to
[52:43] Matthew 10 because this is an
[52:44] interesting one and I'm not going to get
[52:46] totally into some of the doctrinal side
[52:47] of this but I I just want to drop this
[52:50] in so in Matthew 10 ver 40
[52:57] so Matthew 10:40 says he that receiveth
[53:00] you receiveth
[53:03] me right so people even receiving you
[53:06] receive Christ but then it better be
[53:09] Christ not you right don't want it to be
[53:13] you you want it really to be Christ but
[53:15] look what he says here now and he said
[53:18] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[53:20] sent
[53:21] me he that receiveth a prophet in the
[53:25] name of a prophet shall receive a
[53:27] prophet's reward and he that receiveth a
[53:30] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[53:31] man will receive a righteous man's
[53:34] reward and whosoever shall give to drink
[53:37] unto one of these little ones a cup of
[53:39] cold water only in the name of a
[53:43] disciple verily I say unto you he shall
[53:45] in no wise lose his
[53:48] reward so now you are you getting it
[53:50] this is where the rewards come is your
[53:53] service and it's not the amount cuz how
[53:57] I haven't got a cup here have I no oh
[53:59] well I got a bottle you know just a cup
[54:01] of cold
[54:03] water that's all required to receive a
[54:06] reward well we know it's got to be more
[54:08] than that right but it's got to be done
[54:11] in the name of God it's got to be done
[54:14] with the love of God expressed right
[54:16] just somebody says I'm thirsty well you
[54:20] know give him a drink but if you give
[54:22] him a drink with God in
[54:24] mind now you now you're doing something
[54:26] something that God will pay attention
[54:28] to okay so we see
[54:31] then as we go through this thought here
[54:35] that it's an interesting concept that to
[54:39] receive a reward for just giving a cup
[54:41] of cold water so that's not size
[54:43] remember that's sort not size so it
[54:47] doesn't take a lot to get a
[54:50] reward go a little further let's let's
[54:52] do a quote or two here so no matter how
[54:55] little or how small things that you
[54:57] would you do in his name he knows all
[55:00] about it it might seem
[55:04] insignificant but yet if it's done in
[55:06] his name no matter how little he once
[55:10] said if you give to one of these my
[55:14] servants as much as a cup of cold water
[55:18] only in the name of his disciple verily
[55:21] verily I say unto you you shall not lose
[55:23] your reward so it doesn't matter how
[55:26] little that you do Christ always sees
[55:29] the little things that you do and I am
[55:32] so glad that you that aren't you that he
[55:37] sees the little things we
[55:39] do so you know you don't have to be a
[55:43] missionary you don't have to go into the
[55:45] jungles and sleep with all the you know
[55:48] one year one year we were in vanatu and
[55:51] we went into the to the jungles there
[55:54] and and uh next minute we hear the drums
[56:00] going over on the next Ridge the drums
[56:04] are answering yeah and over here they
[56:07] would answer
[56:08] back so I said to the guy that went with
[56:11] me I said go to the Deacon and find out
[56:13] what those drums mean CU vanatu in the
[56:16] island of Pentecost they're only one
[56:18] generation from boiling
[56:20] people so you know we want to make sure
[56:22] we're not the we're not the what's on
[56:25] the menu
[56:27] right so my Deacon at that time he went
[56:31] to the guy and he he he says to him uh
[56:34] what what's all about the drums and the
[56:36] Deacon just
[56:39] smiled that's kind of
[56:41] scary right is he smiling
[56:46] because could be
[56:48] good and you know I'm carrying a little
[56:50] extra weight so it' be night and fat and
[56:53] Sassy so but you know we we we just do
[56:56] whatever we can for the kingdom of God
[56:58] no matter what it is but you don't have
[57:00] to do that just a little cup of cold
[57:02] water is a reward but you do it in his
[57:06] name that's what it's all about his name
[57:09] not my name his name
[57:15] amen here's a
[57:17] question brother brandom have you time
[57:21] can you please explain Matthew 10:41 I
[57:24] would like to know what is a prophet's
[57:29] reward so what's a prophet's reward
[57:32] right let's see what he
[57:34] says well now Jesus said whosoever
[57:37] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[57:39] prophet receive a prophet's reward a
[57:43] prophet's reward is to be a friend with
[57:46] the
[57:47] prophet okay yeah I'm a friend aren't
[57:52] you right it's more than that let's say
[57:55] whosoever receiv re a righteous man in
[57:57] our name of a righteous man receive a
[57:58] righteous man reward is that right and
[58:02] if they want to know what a prophet's
[58:05] reward is oh we're getting close now is
[58:08] to be a friend to the prophecy that's a
[58:12] reward he's your friend like the
[58:15] shunamite it might come in handy
[58:17] sometimes see I did it did with her see
[58:22] Watch God's
[58:24] servants so did he answer answer
[58:26] it he did but you it's kind of laying
[58:29] underneath the surface he didn't come
[58:31] out and tell you exactly what you needed
[58:32] to
[58:33] do but what would it
[58:35] be well thank God we he sent a
[58:40] prophet right cuz where would we
[58:44] be what church would we go to if we
[58:48] didn't have a prophet to tell us what's
[58:50] going to happen at the
[58:52] end that's a
[58:54] reward otherwise you be tied up with
[58:57] some denomination somewhere you'd love
[58:59] God because you're predestinated to love
[59:01] God but you would be caught up with some
[59:03] other denomination some other thinking
[59:05] and you won't get the reward that God
[59:08] has for you because he sent a a prophet
[59:10] to give you reward and when you look at
[59:12] the shite woman that's exactly what
[59:14] happened yeah that's right she obeyed
[59:16] the prophet she got the reward amen
[59:19] that's right hallelujah oh
[59:23] [Laughter]
[59:30] okay so Jesus says in Matthew
[59:35] 2540 the king shall answer and say unto
[59:38] them verily I say unto you in as much as
[59:40] you've done it unto the least of these
[59:42] my brethren you have done it unto me so
[59:46] it's just the least of the people the
[59:49] reward comes so it's not about doing it
[59:52] to a a well-known name or a well-known
[59:55] church or anything like that that it's
[59:56] just where does God want me to help
[59:59] where does God want me to bless I want
[1:00:01] to do
[1:00:04] that let's go to the next
[1:00:06] one use what God gives
[1:00:11] us okay go with me to Matthew 25 because
[1:00:14] this is a this is a touchy
[1:00:18] one because it's talking about the
[1:00:20] kingdom of heaven and Jesus begins to
[1:00:22] tell them about the kingdom of
[1:00:24] heaven and he said says to him
[1:00:31] here he says to him there for the
[1:00:33] Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling
[1:00:36] into a far country who called his
[1:00:39] servants
[1:00:40] 25:14 who called his servants and
[1:00:43] delivered unto them his
[1:00:46] goods and unto one he gave five talents
[1:00:50] to another two to another one now watch
[1:00:54] here's the key verse key part of the
[1:00:57] verse every man according to his ability
[1:01:00] and straight away took his
[1:01:03] journey so he hasn't put anything on you
[1:01:07] that you can't
[1:01:08] handle right he don't expect you to do
[1:01:12] something that is somebody who is
[1:01:14] totally talented that's why I said just
[1:01:17] be faithful not successful he he's put
[1:01:20] on you what you can handle you be
[1:01:22] faithful in what you can handle that's
[1:01:24] all it's required amen
[1:01:26] and so we see then that each one the
[1:01:29] five the two and the one were all given
[1:01:32] according to their
[1:01:33] ability and you know the story don't you
[1:01:36] to what what they did with it okay so I
[1:01:39] I won't go through that but we'll we'll
[1:01:42] take it a little bit further let's go to
[1:01:44] verse 20 and bring it on
[1:01:48] down so he that had received five
[1:01:50] talents brought five other talents right
[1:01:52] so now the Lord's coming back for the
[1:01:54] reward
[1:01:56] and the Lord deliver unto him me five
[1:01:59] talents and behold I have gained beside
[1:02:01] them five talents
[1:02:03] more his lord said unto him well done
[1:02:07] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[1:02:09] been Faithful over a few things I will
[1:02:11] make the ruler over many things enter
[1:02:13] into the joy of the Lord so the guy was
[1:02:17] faithful in five and he doubled it and
[1:02:20] so God was very pleased with that and he
[1:02:23] gave him a reward for that
[1:02:25] you've been faithful there you're going
[1:02:28] to get a reward well done then verse 25
[1:02:32] we go down to the guy who don't only had
[1:02:34] one and I was afraid and I went and I
[1:02:37] hid the town and the Earth and lo thou H
[1:02:40] has said thou hast thou Hast that is
[1:02:44] thine and the Lord answered and said
[1:02:47] unto him thou Wicked and slothful
[1:02:50] servant so even with the one who only
[1:02:53] had one Talent cuz you know I don't know
[1:02:55] maybe maybe you don't have a church
[1:02:56] mouse do you have a church
[1:02:59] mouse I have a church mouse you know oh
[1:03:02] don't oh I you know I'm I'm so so weak
[1:03:06] and me you know I just I just want to
[1:03:07] serve the Lord you know and some people
[1:03:09] just don't oh I'm not capable I could
[1:03:12] never do that he doesn't call you to do
[1:03:15] what I can do he doesn't call you to do
[1:03:17] what some big name could do he calls you
[1:03:19] what you can do nothing more amen you
[1:03:22] know he just lays on you what you can do
[1:03:24] not anything else
[1:03:27] and so we need to realize that even if
[1:03:30] we only have one
[1:03:31] Talent we need to use the talent towards
[1:03:34] the kingdom of God right because if we
[1:03:37] use it towards the kingdom of God
[1:03:39] there's a reward
[1:03:41] amen
[1:03:44] now you all want a reward right I'm
[1:03:47] speaking to reward Believers right okay
[1:03:50] so I want you to understand this only
[1:03:53] whatever he gives you to do you do be
[1:03:55] faith F you get the
[1:04:03] reward so the Bible tells us we've got
[1:04:06] time
[1:04:07] yes oh precious
[1:04:10] time only in our generation that we
[1:04:13] don't have enough
[1:04:14] time right we run out of time every
[1:04:18] time could play on words huh so we we
[1:04:22] see here that the Bible tells us that we
[1:04:24] have
[1:04:26] time but the Bible also tells us in
[1:04:29] Psalm 9
[1:04:30] 90:12 teach us to number our
[1:04:34] days that we may apply our hearts to
[1:04:37] wisdom then over in Ephesians it says
[1:04:40] Ephesians 516 it says redeem the time
[1:04:43] because the days are
[1:04:45] evil so you know we need to pay
[1:04:49] attention to what we do with
[1:04:51] time now do we have time wasters here
[1:04:55] I'm not talking about you but we have
[1:04:57] time waste things we can be involved
[1:05:00] in right and if we're not careful we get
[1:05:03] hooked by
[1:05:04] that and we'll waste our time doing
[1:05:07] stuff that's not productive for the
[1:05:09] kingdom oh but I'm just a little sheep
[1:05:12] and you know nobody pays any attention
[1:05:14] to me don't justify it God's given you a
[1:05:17] talent use the talent don't just say
[1:05:20] well you know brother so and so is
[1:05:22] better at that sister so and so is
[1:05:24] better at that God has given it for
[1:05:28] you so we need to pay attention to our
[1:05:31] time
[1:05:35] amen what else can we say that God has
[1:05:38] given us well this is my
[1:05:42] thinking let's see he's given us
[1:05:46] abilities right so talents god-given
[1:05:52] abilities so what's your god-given
[1:05:54] ability
[1:05:58] now some of you are quite
[1:06:01] smart gone how many You' gone to
[1:06:03] University come on you guys don't be
[1:06:05] afraid to come on show us how you got
[1:06:08] gone to University well I graduated from
[1:06:11] high
[1:06:13] school but that's as far as I got right
[1:06:17] and uh you know my dad never graduated
[1:06:20] but I graduated so you know that's
[1:06:22] something but you know is that my God
[1:06:25] given
[1:06:26] ability not
[1:06:29] necessarily so if we'll look at it here
[1:06:31] in a moment that he has given you an
[1:06:34] ability for the
[1:06:39] church you could be a blessing in the
[1:06:42] church well how would how would I know
[1:06:45] well I can give you a
[1:06:47] test I can give you a test tell you what
[1:06:49] your talents
[1:06:53] are so let's go a little further with
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:59] go with me to 1 Corinthians 12 say this
[1:07:02] is talking about the gifts now we all
[1:07:04] want the gifts to operate don't
[1:07:07] we genuine Holy Ghost gifts operating in
[1:07:10] the assembly right we want it genuine
[1:07:13] you don't want the fake we want the
[1:07:14] genuine
[1:07:16] article and so
[1:07:18] often we look at the genuine article as
[1:07:21] being an outward display of something
[1:07:25] to where everybody sees it like
[1:07:28] prophecy and for over 40 years we've had
[1:07:31] tongues and interpretation in our church
[1:07:34] when was needed not every service but
[1:07:38] when it was needed so somebody's going
[1:07:40] through a a rough time or needing some
[1:07:43] advice the tongues interpretation will
[1:07:45] come out and tell them exactly what's
[1:07:47] going to happen and what they need to do
[1:07:49] that's true tongues interpretation that
[1:07:50] what brother Brown taught us because
[1:07:53] it's it's meeting the need at that point
[1:07:56] not yeah I say unto you there's somebody
[1:07:59] here in the back row with a
[1:08:03] backache where's the sister with a
[1:08:05] backache that we pray for this
[1:08:08] morning because you know I mean there's
[1:08:10] you're going to find somebody with
[1:08:11] backaches you're going to find somebody
[1:08:12] with different things I mean that's not
[1:08:14] directive that's why brother Bram says
[1:08:16] you yeah right he pointed it out it was
[1:08:19] direct amen so we see here now is we
[1:08:23] look at this thought in 1 Corinthians 12
[1:08:26] it says now there are diversities of
[1:08:28] gifts so that means
[1:08:32] multitudes more than one but the Same
[1:08:37] Spirit there's diversities of
[1:08:40] administration so that means it can come
[1:08:42] in several different
[1:08:44] ways and but it's the same Lord and
[1:08:48] there's diversities of
[1:08:51] operations so now it doesn't necessarily
[1:08:53] have to happen at church
[1:09:00] right because you know you're only on
[1:09:01] church on Sunday and maybe Wednesday but
[1:09:04] it can happen
[1:09:05] anytime right because there's
[1:09:07] diversities of
[1:09:10] operations okay let's go a little
[1:09:12] further with this thing but it's the
[1:09:15] same God which worketh all in all but
[1:09:17] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[1:09:19] to every man to profit with all so every
[1:09:23] one of you have been given something for
[1:09:25] the kingdom of God at least one
[1:09:29] Talent okay so how do I know what talent
[1:09:32] is go with me
[1:09:35] to uh Romans
[1:09:41] 12 Romans
[1:09:44] 12 and we're going to pick up in
[1:09:49] verse you're going to pick up in verse
[1:09:51] six
[1:10:01] then having gifts
[1:10:03] differing according to the grace that is
[1:10:05] given to us whether
[1:10:10] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[1:10:13] the proportion of Faith or
[1:10:16] Ministry let us wait on our
[1:10:20] ministry ministering or he that teacheth
[1:10:24] on teaching he that exhorteth on
[1:10:27] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[1:10:29] with Simplicity he that ruleth with
[1:10:32] diligence he that showeth Mercy with
[1:10:35] cheerfulness so there's seven gifts
[1:10:39] there and the prophecy one is really a p
[1:10:42] i like to you know we get a little
[1:10:44] scared if we call it prophecy because
[1:10:45] you know we probably don't prophesy but
[1:10:48] we can be
[1:10:51] perceivers in other words God's given
[1:10:53] you a spirit of discernment to see
[1:10:55] what's wrong and what's right and you're
[1:10:58] quick to pick that
[1:11:00] up your person only has to walk in the
[1:11:03] room have any of you ever met George
[1:11:06] Smith he was married to Rebecca B
[1:11:09] brandom okay so he came to my church and
[1:11:13] we're in the back fixing things up for
[1:11:15] the supper in the
[1:11:16] evening and uh he's greeting some of the
[1:11:21] people and he comes to
[1:11:23] me he says you're going to have trouble
[1:11:25] with that one and that one and that one
[1:11:28] I said yeah I know and he was absolutely
[1:11:31] right he had a spirit of discernment by
[1:11:35] talking with the people to he could see
[1:11:37] that there were problems there that
[1:11:39] could be a problem within the
[1:11:40] church right so the perceivers perceive
[1:11:44] things then we have the
[1:11:47] server and the server generally works
[1:11:49] out as a a sister but we've have some
[1:11:52] brothers that are useful
[1:11:57] usually
[1:11:59] deacons and you know the we've got
[1:12:02] several in our church and the minute the
[1:12:04] kitchen is open for things to happen
[1:12:06] those girls are there and they're into
[1:12:08] it and they're fixing and they're
[1:12:09] fussing and they're carrying on why
[1:12:11] because the gift that God has given them
[1:12:15] is
[1:12:16] serving and that's all they know how to
[1:12:18] do but they got to be careful because if
[1:12:21] they come to your house they'll
[1:12:22] rearrange your whole house without even
[1:12:25] asking you know because the gift is just
[1:12:28] there and they've got to do it man I
[1:12:29] just oh this needs picking up that
[1:12:30] need's cleaning out oh oh look at this
[1:12:33] this needs fixing up that's what they do
[1:12:35] right so there's a there's a spiritual
[1:12:38] way to use it and a carnal way to use it
[1:12:41] right okay so now we got that then we've
[1:12:43] got the teacher who teaches and that's
[1:12:47] kind of what I'm doing here but I'm also
[1:12:49] an exhorter so I exhort you to do the
[1:12:52] right thing right and that's that's a
[1:12:54] gift amen and and you know we need each
[1:12:58] one of these and he's not only going to
[1:13:00] just use you
[1:13:01] once throw you away because we're in a
[1:13:04] throwaway Society right use something
[1:13:06] once throw it away no he he can keep
[1:13:08] using you just stay Supple say God take
[1:13:11] this gift you've given me let me be a
[1:13:13] blessing even though it's only one
[1:13:15] Talent let me be a blessing in your to
[1:13:17] the church amen and then we've got we've
[1:13:21] got the
[1:13:22] organizer give him a project
[1:13:26] poof all organized run
[1:13:29] smoothly brother Kubin I would think
[1:13:31] that you would be one you haven't done
[1:13:33] the test yet but I I see that in you
[1:13:36] already I'm not
[1:13:38] prophesying okay but I I just by
[1:13:40] discernment I'm I I see that in you so
[1:13:44] we there's people that just do it
[1:13:45] automatic now I can do it but it doesn't
[1:13:48] come
[1:13:50] naturally and you can do it cuz all
[1:13:53] seven gifts would should be in our our
[1:13:55] lives right but there'll be one that's
[1:13:57] way out ahead because God gave it to you
[1:14:00] for the body has a talent to use for the
[1:14:04] Kingdom so like I said I can give you a
[1:14:06] test you can find out what you are I had
[1:14:08] a Canadian girl in Eugene's
[1:14:11] Church and they were going back to
[1:14:14] Saskatchewan and she said I haven't got
[1:14:16] my gift I don't know what I am and I
[1:14:18] said sister you'll still make the
[1:14:19] Rapture it's
[1:14:22] okay but you know because they they want
[1:14:25] want to be used I mean we all want to be
[1:14:26] used right yeah amen so but take that
[1:14:29] gift because there's diversities there's
[1:14:31] different operations there's ways that
[1:14:34] God can use you that you're unexpecting
[1:14:36] to happen and it'll
[1:14:38] happen and then there's the mercy at the
[1:14:41] end and the mercy is the person that
[1:14:44] provides Comfort to people they see
[1:14:46] somebody hurting and they immediately go
[1:14:48] and they identify with them and they
[1:14:50] they they pray with them and they they
[1:14:52] cry with them and they do Mercy things
[1:14:55] in fact when I did it in Eugene's Church
[1:14:58] there was a man there that was just
[1:15:00] retiring from working in the hospital as
[1:15:02] an
[1:15:03] orderly he said my whole life I've
[1:15:07] wondered why when I'm pushing people
[1:15:09] down the hallway they're pouring their
[1:15:11] lives out to me he said I now realize
[1:15:15] God gave me a gift of Mercy to pray for
[1:15:17] the people to help the people see the
[1:15:20] gift is there you just need to identify
[1:15:22] what it is and then say God take this
[1:15:25] this talent that you have given me and
[1:15:28] use it for the kingdom of God because I
[1:15:30] know that it will finally bring a reward
[1:15:32] it might be small but still I'm using
[1:15:34] I'm being faithful right the faithful
[1:15:37] than little things he'll give you the
[1:15:38] big
[1:15:44] things okay
[1:15:49] so let's go along a little bit further
[1:15:52] in 1 Peter 4:1 it says every man hath
[1:15:56] received a GI the gift now that's not
[1:15:59] only
[1:15:59] salvation even so Minister the same one
[1:16:03] to another as good Steward stewards of
[1:16:06] the manifold grace of God so you've been
[1:16:09] given a gift to use for the
[1:16:13] kingdom and why not use
[1:16:16] it why not use it for God's Kingdom
[1:16:27] and the last one is
[1:16:30] treasure so on 1 Corinthians 16 verse TW
[1:16:35] 2 it says upon the first day of the week
[1:16:38] let every one of you lay by him in store
[1:16:41] as God has
[1:16:43] prospered him that there be no Gathering
[1:16:46] when I come so he's talking about being
[1:16:49] faithful in your tithing he's talking
[1:16:52] about giving to the Lord right and we've
[1:16:55] been given that gift of a
[1:16:58] job right if you don't have a job pray
[1:17:01] for a job cuz God wants you to
[1:17:05] work so pray for a job that God would
[1:17:07] give you a job that you could give back
[1:17:09] to the Lord and you know you can started
[1:17:12] as young ones now it's going to be a
[1:17:13] little harder maybe for some of no it
[1:17:15] shouldn't be any harder you you'll be
[1:17:17] you're creative like when our kids were
[1:17:19] small we worked on a sheep
[1:17:21] station so there wasn't you know they
[1:17:23] had their chores one of the boys would
[1:17:25] Milk The Cow and the other boy would
[1:17:28] bring the cow back in when he got out of
[1:17:30] school from the school bus he walked up
[1:17:32] the up the lane and bring the cow back
[1:17:34] in separate the cow from the calf and
[1:17:36] and then the oldest boy would Milk The
[1:17:38] Cow in the morning and he let the hens
[1:17:39] out so he collect the leg eggs and so
[1:17:41] there was jobs to do but they wanted
[1:17:43] extra pocket
[1:17:45] money there was plucking dead
[1:17:48] sheep now you probably never heard of
[1:17:51] this so when the Sheep dies and it blows
[1:17:54] up
[1:17:55] the the wool will come away from the
[1:17:57] skin but you got to have rubber gloves
[1:18:00] because it stinks he
[1:18:03] stinketh and and so I would tell the
[1:18:06] boys where I'd found dead sheep on the
[1:18:09] farm and they would go and they take a
[1:18:11] gunny sack and a j Sack or something and
[1:18:14] they would go and they would pick up the
[1:18:16] wool and put it in and step it down and
[1:18:19] get it firm and then they leave it by a
[1:18:22] Gateway so when I came by with a tractor
[1:18:24] I'd pick the wool up and then they would
[1:18:26] bring it to the uh yards where we were
[1:18:29] at and then the wool buyer would come
[1:18:30] around once a month and he would buy
[1:18:32] their wool then that was their money and
[1:18:35] we taught them to tithe on that money
[1:18:37] now that money was hard it wasn't easy
[1:18:40] money to get and their mother wouldn't
[1:18:42] let them in the house after they after
[1:18:45] they've been plucking dead cheap right
[1:18:47] they had to sit outside take their
[1:18:49] clothes off outside and then come in and
[1:18:50] have a shower because they stunk right
[1:18:54] but it was still their way of earning
[1:18:57] money pocket money and they paid their
[1:19:01] tithing unto the Lord before they were
[1:19:03] even Christians we taught them to
[1:19:05] tithe and it's a good principle because
[1:19:08] we see
[1:19:10] here that if we go to Proverbs 3:9 it
[1:19:14] says honor the Lord with thy substance
[1:19:16] and with the first fruits of thy in of
[1:19:18] all thy increase so shall thy barns be
[1:19:20] filled with py and thy press shall burst
[1:19:23] out with new wine
[1:19:27] wow now you know we had an earthquake
[1:19:30] right 10 years ago now or more how many
[1:19:34] is it Mar you 10 mom
[1:19:36] 2012
[1:19:39] 11
[1:19:40] 10 how much am I
[1:19:43] bid 10 okay so we had this earthquake
[1:19:46] took out our
[1:19:48] church
[1:19:50] H Margie lost her house K Adams lost her
[1:19:55] house MERS lost their house Jeff and
[1:19:58] Jane lost their house anybody
[1:20:02] else there were five of them that lost
[1:20:04] houses John John and it was wasn't
[1:20:07] married then John
[1:20:09] Ward
[1:20:12] huh it was his rental but yeah he it was
[1:20:15] it went down with a quake so been
[1:20:18] faithful all her
[1:20:20] life what'd you end up with more money
[1:20:22] than what you paid for
[1:20:25] God was faithful right each one of those
[1:20:28] five people that had been faithful in
[1:20:30] their tithing when it came time the
[1:20:32] earthquake commission paid them back
[1:20:34] more than what the house was
[1:20:35] worth so that's God right they would
[1:20:38] have never got that without the
[1:20:40] Quake Mary probably never been here
[1:20:43] without the Quake either she probably
[1:20:44] still been down down home but you know
[1:20:48] God is so faithful and this is the good
[1:20:50] thing about being an old person you
[1:20:53] watch it happen over years years it
[1:20:55] doesn't happen in the blink it takes
[1:20:58] years for this stuff to unfold and then
[1:21:00] you look back and you go wow God was
[1:21:02] faithful all the way back there and
[1:21:04] brought it right through now there was a
[1:21:07] guy that didn't pay
[1:21:10] ties so he lost his house too it was a
[1:21:15] rental and he struggled and he struggled
[1:21:18] to find another house and he's still
[1:21:19] struggling to find a house and I think
[1:21:21] he's paying over $500 a week now for
[1:21:23] rent
[1:21:25] but you know when God is being honored
[1:21:28] with the first fruits of your being God
[1:21:31] will bless you may take a while to see
[1:21:34] it but when it comes to Crunch God's
[1:21:38] there amen
[1:21:42] amen the reward comes
[1:21:48] through okay but being that it's
[1:21:52] given the hundred and something
[1:21:56] $17 brother Brown's received an offering
[1:21:59] something the Brethren told me thank you
[1:22:02] my precious friend I will take that
[1:22:04] straight to the mission field to feed
[1:22:06] the hungry children see them laying on
[1:22:10] the street with their little belly swell
[1:22:12] up from starvation doing everything I
[1:22:14] can to make it count and at that day
[1:22:19] when the rewards are given out you will
[1:22:22] see where it went
[1:22:25] God ever bless you that's a portion of
[1:22:27] your living that we share with
[1:22:31] others so see you don't see it sometimes
[1:22:36] you might not even see the reward until
[1:22:38] right at the end and just because you
[1:22:40] did that you do it unto the least of
[1:22:42] these my brethren you've done it unto
[1:22:48] me okay let's go a little more personal
[1:22:51] now so how do I where do I get my reward
[1:22:54] okay
[1:22:56] so we're in a race now this is a
[1:23:00] few Olympics back because I don't think
[1:23:03] our Olympic Champions or Olympic Golds
[1:23:06] any longer um and husin bolt certainly
[1:23:10] isn't running anymore he he cannot run
[1:23:13] the fastest guy now but you know he was
[1:23:15] fast in his day and he was a trainer and
[1:23:17] so Paul used the thought
[1:23:20] here and we see it pick it up in uh 1
[1:23:24] Corinthians
[1:23:25] 9:24 where he says know you not that
[1:23:27] they which run in a race run all but one
[1:23:30] receiveth the prize so run that ye may
[1:23:34] obtain so Paul is showing here that
[1:23:37] we're in a race amen and it's not him
[1:23:39] that starts it's him that
[1:23:43] finishes and you know over the years
[1:23:46] we've done quite a few things for the
[1:23:48] Lord and one of the things was we had
[1:23:50] youth camps back in
[1:23:52] 1990 so back back in 1990 we we gathered
[1:23:56] the young people in that time which are
[1:23:58] now old and uh and and we had youth
[1:24:02] camps for them and so
[1:24:04] the realizing that after all those years
[1:24:08] there's still a few of those people that
[1:24:10] are going on though the majority have
[1:24:13] drifted away so you go well that was a
[1:24:16] waste of time no hey one world one soul
[1:24:19] is worth a thousand worlds right so you
[1:24:22] know you do it for the Lord and the Lord
[1:24:26] brings the reward amen so it's not about
[1:24:29] numbers it's about being faithful and
[1:24:31] let God deal the
[1:24:38] rest I will give thee a crown of life
[1:24:41] since not even a cup of cold water is
[1:24:43] given in the name of the Lord fails to
[1:24:46] receive a reward how great shall the be
[1:24:49] the reward to him that gives his life as
[1:24:51] a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:54] perhaps we can't get a we can get a
[1:24:57] small idea if we compare it with a crown
[1:25:00] or with the crown won in a race 1
[1:25:03] Corinthians 9:24 Paul says know you not
[1:25:06] that they that run in the race run all
[1:25:08] but one receiveth the prize Soul run
[1:25:11] that ye may obtain so the crown given to
[1:25:15] the winner of the Olympic race was a
[1:25:18] Garland of an olive branch but the crown
[1:25:21] spoken of here in the book in the
[1:25:23] revelation s is given to a martyr is a
[1:25:27] crown of royalty see Jesus calls it a
[1:25:31] crown of life so we're going for the
[1:25:33] Crown of Life not a crown a gold medal
[1:25:37] or anything but a crown of
[1:25:40] life
[1:25:44] now as we realize this then we also I
[1:25:49] want you to go to 1 Corinthians uh 9:25
[1:25:55] and we'll just pick up just finish the
[1:25:57] thought here because there's a there's a
[1:25:58] thought that's going to go in with the
[1:26:01] next one the next thing I'm going to do
[1:26:04] so we'll pick it up in verse
[1:26:11] 25 now every man that receiveth a
[1:26:13] Mastery is tempered in all things now
[1:26:17] they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown
[1:26:19] we an
[1:26:20] Incorruptible I therefore run
[1:26:24] so run not as
[1:26:26] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:26:31] beateth the air but I keep my
[1:26:34] body and I bring it into
[1:26:37] subjection lest by any means when I have
[1:26:40] preached to others I myself should be a
[1:26:43] cast
[1:26:43] away so we see here that we have to keep
[1:26:47] our body in
[1:26:49] subjection So it's talking then I should
[1:26:52] have F that off but that'll
[1:26:55] do so it's talking about our old
[1:26:58] nature and so God wants us to deal with
[1:27:01] our old
[1:27:02] nature in Romans 6 it says let not sin
[1:27:08] therefore re in your mortal bodies that
[1:27:11] you should obey the lust thereof so
[1:27:14] we're not to let sin reign in our mortal
[1:27:16] body you know some people say well I
[1:27:18] can't stop
[1:27:20] smoking well don't let it rain
[1:27:24] take it to the Lord in prayer until you
[1:27:25] get the victory over it
[1:27:27] right and then we go a little bit
[1:27:29] further and we
[1:27:31] see that the Bible says for we shall not
[1:27:34] live after the flesh ye shall die sorry
[1:27:37] if we live after the flesh we shall die
[1:27:39] but if we through the spirit do mortify
[1:27:41] the Deeds of the body we shall live so
[1:27:45] mortify means put to death so you know
[1:27:48] we have kids
[1:27:49] nowadays that are
[1:27:52] Gamers then we have people have road
[1:27:55] rage and they don't bring their body
[1:27:57] into subjection they just let it
[1:28:00] out and so as we we've been telling you
[1:28:04] here about the anger the Bible says be
[1:28:07] angry because it acknowledges you're
[1:28:09] going to get angry but don't
[1:28:12] sin get a resolve to the anger so we see
[1:28:16] then that the Bible shows us that we are
[1:28:18] to make ourselves subject mortify the
[1:28:20] Deeds of our body that we shall
[1:28:22] live now as I look at this
[1:28:25] thought we realize that
[1:28:31] the can you kick me back again do
[1:28:34] Escape because I clicked it and go back
[1:28:37] one just
[1:28:39] one uh no back to uh 14 I think it is
[1:28:43] there yeah there okay so that means
[1:28:47] mortify means to put to death so you and
[1:28:50] I have the ability to put to death that
[1:28:54] sin in our body that's sin that makes us
[1:28:56] that makes us fall away from the things
[1:28:58] of
[1:28:59] God then the next one that we want to
[1:29:02] look
[1:29:03] at
[1:29:06] is being a
[1:29:08] witness so in in uh
[1:29:11] Daniel it says here they that are wise
[1:29:14] shall shine as the brightness of the
[1:29:17] frament
[1:29:18] permament and they that turn many to
[1:29:21] righteousness as the Stars forever
[1:29:25] so we have an an obligation to lead
[1:29:27] others to Christ now hey I hey this is
[1:29:30] hard this is hard work because nobody's
[1:29:33] really interested right you talk to
[1:29:36] unbelievers they're not
[1:29:38] interested you know when I do this anger
[1:29:40] resolution course in the prison they
[1:29:43] it's a volunteer thing so they come in
[1:29:45] and the first thing I do is give them an
[1:29:47] introduction of what I'm going to do and
[1:29:49] where I'm taking them and I bring in
[1:29:51] that it's going to be biblical oriented
[1:29:53] I said if you're you're not interested
[1:29:54] in there get up and leave and they do
[1:29:58] I've had them walk out and I only
[1:29:59] spending five minutes in there because
[1:30:00] they don't want anything to do with God
[1:30:03] but there have been others that'll stick
[1:30:04] for a while and we can start off with 12
[1:30:07] guys but we're lucky we end up with six
[1:30:09] at the end of three months because it
[1:30:11] takes three months to go through the
[1:30:12] course so we see then that we realize
[1:30:15] that it's difficult to witness to
[1:30:17] somebody but you know what you're not
[1:30:20] going to Heaven until we find that last
[1:30:22] one right there's no way we're going to
[1:30:25] get out of here without saving somebody
[1:30:27] so why not let New Zealand be the one
[1:30:29] that brings the last one in huh and we
[1:30:31] can stand there in that day we got him
[1:30:34] you were looking for him but we got him
[1:30:36] we brought him in amen because we see
[1:30:39] then by bringing somebody to Christ it's
[1:30:41] like the stars of Heaven they shine in
[1:30:44] the crown of our Lord Jesus so there's
[1:30:47] nothing more wonderful than to lead
[1:30:50] somebody to the Lord right amen oh
[1:30:54] that's exciting
[1:31:03] am so the next one as we looked at is
[1:31:08] realizing the doctrine how much does the
[1:31:11] doctrine mean to
[1:31:14] us so in second Timothy 2 verse 4 it
[1:31:19] says I have fought a good fight this is
[1:31:21] Paul speaking I fought a good fight I
[1:31:24] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:31:26] henceforth is laid up for me a crown of
[1:31:30] righteousness which the
[1:31:32] Lord which the Lord the righteous judge
[1:31:35] shall give me at that day and not to me
[1:31:40] only but unto all them also that love
[1:31:45] his
[1:31:46] appearing Lord Jesus come
[1:31:49] quickly right but like I said to you
[1:31:52] earlier on where would you you be
[1:31:55] without this messag what church would
[1:31:57] you go to how could you be spiritually
[1:32:01] fed it would be terrible to be in that
[1:32:05] position right now churches are not
[1:32:07] perfect by all means and I don't think
[1:32:09] Ben is nor is mine but they're better
[1:32:12] than the
[1:32:13] rest right so we need to see that God
[1:32:18] has given us a special blessing yeah to
[1:32:21] be able to
[1:32:22] share the word of God amen and when the
[1:32:25] person catches
[1:32:28] it like we had a prisoner here just
[1:32:30] recently it was with us for three or
[1:32:32] four months after he got
[1:32:34] out and he didn't like about brother
[1:32:37] Bram he didn't think we needed brother
[1:32:38] Bram but he goes to other churches then
[1:32:41] and he comes back he says you know what
[1:32:43] you're the only church that's got your
[1:32:45] kids under
[1:32:46] control he said the last church I was in
[1:32:49] it got so bad while the woman was
[1:32:51] talking up front she had to stop because
[1:32:53] the kid was running up and down the
[1:32:54] aisle screaming he said your kids are
[1:32:58] good I said there's a reason for that we
[1:33:01] were taught right
[1:33:03] amen cuz you'd be just like the rest of
[1:33:06] them if it wasn't for the teaching amen
[1:33:09] right that's a natural sort of thing you
[1:33:11] just follow the rest of the crowd so
[1:33:14] thank God for a message amen that opened
[1:33:17] our eyes to the understanding of what he
[1:33:19] wanted that's what he said would give us
[1:33:21] a reward amen praise the Lord for that
[1:33:30] huh okay let's go a little
[1:33:33] further
[1:33:36] and how much how much so how faithful
[1:33:41] are you to God's
[1:33:43] word see the biggest problem we have is
[1:33:46] reading our Bible and
[1:33:47] praying right we haven't got time too
[1:33:51] busy got to go go go go so you know we
[1:33:54] get to the point to where we read a
[1:33:56] verse real quick and carry on read a
[1:33:59] chapter real quick carry on hey I hey
[1:34:02] I'm preaching that
[1:34:03] myself okay now if you're involved in
[1:34:06] this you can say oh
[1:34:08] me right I say Amen because I'm involved
[1:34:12] in this as well because because we can
[1:34:14] get so familiar that we know where the
[1:34:15] scriptures are saying but we don't take
[1:34:18] the depth of it any
[1:34:20] longer so the Bible said if you continue
[1:34:22] in my words in John 8:31 if you continue
[1:34:26] in my words then are you my disciples
[1:34:28] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:34:29] truth shall set you
[1:34:31] free and then it goes on in Philippians
[1:34:34] whereby my beloved as many as you have
[1:34:36] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[1:34:40] much more in my absence work out your
[1:34:43] salvation with fear and trembling so now
[1:34:47] it's our responsibility to read the word
[1:34:49] and get something from it you know so we
[1:34:52] study the word
[1:34:54] and we can do it as a family we have
[1:34:56] family or we can with single ones we can
[1:34:58] we can do it with single people together
[1:35:00] to where we study the word to get what
[1:35:02] is it saying to
[1:35:03] me I've got a talent I want to use it
[1:35:07] Lord help me to figure out what you want
[1:35:08] me to do with this talent I don't want
[1:35:10] it sitting there on the Shelf I want to
[1:35:11] be able to see something
[1:35:15] happening okay then the Bible tells us
[1:35:18] here but continue in the things which
[1:35:21] you thou has sought this is 2 Timothy
[1:35:22] 3:14
[1:35:24] continue in the things which thou Hast
[1:35:26] learned and has been assured of knowing
[1:35:30] that whom thou Hast learned them so he's
[1:35:32] talking about himself that from a child
[1:35:35] thou has known the holy scriptures which
[1:35:38] are able to make thee wise un salvation
[1:35:41] which is through faith which is in
[1:35:44] Christ Jesus for all scripture is given
[1:35:47] by inspiration of God profitable for
[1:35:49] Doctrine Repro correction instruction
[1:35:51] and righteousness that the man of God
[1:35:53] may be perfect thoroughly furnished on
[1:35:54] every good works so God wants you to
[1:35:57] come to that place of knowing the word
[1:36:00] all right and using it in your life and
[1:36:03] so you got to ask questions sometimes
[1:36:05] what's it saying to me how does that
[1:36:07] work in my life you know meditation is a
[1:36:10] long thing that's been forgotten for a
[1:36:12] long time because meditation is you know
[1:36:14] the yoga meditation those guys do it but
[1:36:17] we're talking about meditation in the
[1:36:18] word yeah to where you take the word and
[1:36:21] you begin to say let me give you an
[1:36:23] example I always use this
[1:36:25] one Philippians 4: 19 anybody know what
[1:36:28] it
[1:36:30] is
[1:36:31] Christine there you go now did you catch
[1:36:35] that my God is he your God my God she'll
[1:36:41] do what Supply how much
[1:36:45] all right you you break it down so it
[1:36:47] becomes more personal to you as an
[1:36:50] individual and when the scripture
[1:36:51] becomes personal to you it ignites you
[1:36:55] it empowers you you know it will set you
[1:36:59] free because you will get the scripture
[1:37:01] that is able to make you
[1:37:04] wise
[1:37:10] amen oh I did it again back me up one
[1:37:13] please sorry about
[1:37:15] this so one
[1:37:18] back there you
[1:37:20] go okay and we don't look at things that
[1:37:24] we go on so much temporary now but we
[1:37:27] look to the end of the road where the
[1:37:29] rewards are given father we pray this
[1:37:32] morning that you will make our hearts
[1:37:34] solemn before thee as we listen pray
[1:37:38] that you will speak to us Lord through
[1:37:41] mortal lips may we hear you through
[1:37:44] mortal lips and then may we in return
[1:37:48] obey everything that you command us
[1:37:53] so are you listening amen amen okay I
[1:37:57] want you to give me a take-home thought
[1:37:59] at the
[1:38:00] end let's go a little further now what's
[1:38:02] a take-home thought what actually spoke
[1:38:04] to you yeah hey because I've been going
[1:38:08] for what over an hour now right is that
[1:38:11] right about an
[1:38:13] hour and I've said a lot of
[1:38:15] things and you might be got one thing
[1:38:18] and the next minute that thought drifted
[1:38:22] you and you just went
[1:38:25] bye-bye right so bring that thought back
[1:38:28] and what was it that really spoke to you
[1:38:31] okay be ready we're getting
[1:38:33] there one
[1:38:41] more so the Bible tells us here how we
[1:38:44] suffer for
[1:38:45] Christ so the Bible says beloved think
[1:38:49] it not strange concerning the fiery
[1:38:51] trial which is to try you you as though
[1:38:54] some s strange thing happened to you but
[1:38:57] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[1:39:00] of Christ's suffering that when his
[1:39:02] glory shall be revealed you shall be
[1:39:05] glad also with exceeding
[1:39:08] Joy this is you
[1:39:11] know the Bible tells us that suffering
[1:39:14] is a part of Christian Living you're not
[1:39:17] going to get out of it I'm not going to
[1:39:18] get out of it it's going to happen some
[1:39:22] people it's going to be harder than
[1:39:23] others right some people are going to
[1:39:26] lose things some people are going to
[1:39:27] lose family are going to lose
[1:39:29] possessions but everybody suffers amen
[1:39:32] so it's a principle of
[1:39:34] God so don't think it's strange yeah
[1:39:38] that this has come upon you God has put
[1:39:40] it there for a
[1:39:42] reason it isn't it's for your
[1:39:45] good so you know there's another
[1:39:48] scripture in James that says count it
[1:39:49] all
[1:39:51] joy oh oh all joy how do you do that
[1:39:56] praise God my car just blew up
[1:39:58] Hallelujah Love You Lord well you know
[1:40:02] it's very hard to do that
[1:40:03] sincerely now you might say
[1:40:06] it but not really mean it right but you
[1:40:10] got to be able to say it and mean it
[1:40:13] thank
[1:40:14] God the kid just drove into a you
[1:40:19] know it's it's those things that are
[1:40:22] there are for us to suffer under and
[1:40:24] we're to count it all
[1:40:27] joy
[1:40:29] now uh the Bible tells us in Matthew 5
[1:40:32] the beatitude says blessed are ye when
[1:40:34] men shall revile you persecute you say
[1:40:35] all manner of evil against you falsely
[1:40:38] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:40:39] is your reward in heaven for so
[1:40:41] persecuted Thee the uh prophets which
[1:40:44] were
[1:40:45] before now let me just I just got one
[1:40:48] one or two more things to do
[1:40:51] here now watch what he says here this is
[1:40:54] a really good quote even though it's in
[1:40:56] the church age book and the church age
[1:40:59] book wasn't written by brother Brandon
[1:41:00] it was written by Brother Vil but he
[1:41:02] read it so cloudy skies and storms of
[1:41:05] life are no sign of God's disapproval
[1:41:08] you got that yeah that's important yeah
[1:41:12] Cloudy
[1:41:14] Skies uh cloudy skies and storms of life
[1:41:17] are no sign of God's disapproval neither
[1:41:21] are bright Skies
[1:41:23] and still water signs of his appro of
[1:41:26] his love and
[1:41:28] approval just because things are going
[1:41:30] good doesn't mean that he's approving
[1:41:32] it
[1:41:36] whoa okay his approval of any of us is
[1:41:41] only in the
[1:41:44] Beloved wow that's a resap approval is
[1:41:48] not and whether things are going well
[1:41:51] Jimmy keep those fingers how that
[1:41:55] saw you know and so his love is elective
[1:41:59] which he had for us before the
[1:42:01] foundation of the world does he love us
[1:42:05] oh
[1:42:07] yes but how much so but how shall we
[1:42:12] know we shall know because he said so
[1:42:16] amen and manifested that he did love us
[1:42:21] for he brought us to to himself and gave
[1:42:24] us of his Spirit placing us as sons of
[1:42:28] God and how shall I prove my love to him
[1:42:32] question
[1:42:33] mark by believing what he said and
[1:42:37] conducting myself with joy in the midst
[1:42:40] of the trial that he in his wisdom
[1:42:46] allowed to come to
[1:42:48] pass wow Mark that down print it out put
[1:42:54] it on your
[1:42:55] refrigerator because there will be times
[1:42:57] of Cloudy Skies and there will be times
[1:43:00] of sunshine but his love is because you
[1:43:04] are the Beloved that's where it comes to
[1:43:06] pass amen and he's going to see you
[1:43:08] through no matter what where it
[1:43:12] goes okay last
[1:43:19] page Revelations 22 behold I come
[1:43:23] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[1:43:26] every man according to his Works shall
[1:43:29] be so what sort of a reward will you
[1:43:33] have have you laid up any
[1:43:36] treasure because he tells you to lay up
[1:43:39] treasure so I hope that I didn't confuse
[1:43:42] you but that you actually see now where
[1:43:45] the treasures are and what you can do to
[1:43:49] be a useful in the kingdom of
[1:43:52] God I can give brother Ben the test on
[1:43:55] the motivational gifts so you can see
[1:43:56] what your gifts
[1:43:58] are because you'll have
[1:44:00] one now I came across this stuff 30
[1:44:04] years ago and when I took the test to
[1:44:07] tell me what my motivational gift was I
[1:44:10] was 20 points ahead of any other gift in
[1:44:13] ex exhortation 20 points the other ones
[1:44:15] were clustered here and when it came to
[1:44:17] Mercy that wasn't too
[1:44:21] good and and so over the 30 years that
[1:44:24] I've been going through this material
[1:44:27] and and sharing it with others to help
[1:44:29] them find their
[1:44:31] gift I've taken the test several times
[1:44:34] and each time my strength keeps coming
[1:44:38] back but my other ones keep going
[1:44:41] up thank God I'm
[1:44:44] maturing
[1:44:46] huh you know cuz that's what it should
[1:44:48] be to where you mature you know I'm not
[1:44:51] just a one-sided Christian
[1:44:54] I I've got a maturity here now and so
[1:44:57] the last time I took it I was only maybe
[1:44:59] five or 10 points ahead of the other
[1:45:02] gifts the other gifts were clustered
[1:45:04] even Mercy had come up a
[1:45:06] bit so we see then that those gifts are
[1:45:09] there for what for the edifying of the
[1:45:12] Saints yeah amen and it gives you an
[1:45:15] opportunity to see God work in your life
