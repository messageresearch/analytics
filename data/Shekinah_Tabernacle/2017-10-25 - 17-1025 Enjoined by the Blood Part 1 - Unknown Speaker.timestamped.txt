[34:20] Chris off the boat too god bless you
[34:21] I mean I I know you part of the
[34:24] furniture but it's always good to see
[34:25] you so you know amen let's go to first
[34:27] John chapter 1 I want to read from here
[34:40] so first John chapter 1 verse 1 that
[34:48] which was from the beginning which we
[34:50] have heard which we have seen with our
[34:53] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[34:56] hands have handled of the word of life
[34:58] for the life was manifested and we have
[35:00] seen it and be a witness and show unto
[35:03] you that eternal life which was with the
[35:06] father and was manifested unto us that
[35:09] which we have seen and we have heard
[35:12] declare we unto you that ye also may
[35:14] have fellowship with us and truly our
[35:16] Fellowship is with the father and with
[35:18] the son Jesus Christ and these things
[35:21] right we unto you that your joy might be
[35:24] full and let's go to the book of Hebrews
[35:26] chapter 9
[35:28] but notice just as you're turning there
[35:29] the only way that you can that John
[35:32] could be a witness of eternal life as
[35:37] any more than just seen it but he
[35:40] received it but we've seen eternal life
[35:44] manifested in this hour let's go to
[35:47] Hebrews 9 and we're in verse 16 and this
[35:50] may be two different very piece of
[35:52] Scripture but hopefully I pray the Lord
[35:53] will tight together he seasoned in
[35:57] Hebrews 9 and in verse 16 it says for
[36:01] where a testament is there must also
[36:03] have necessity be the death of the
[36:06] testator for a testament is of force
[36:08] after men are dead otherwise it is of no
[36:11] strength after all while the testator
[36:13] liveth whereupon neither the first
[36:16] Testament was dedicated without blood
[36:18] when Moses had spoken every precept to
[36:21] all the people according to the law he
[36:24] took the blood of calves and of goats
[36:26] air with water and scarlet wool wool and
[36:29] hyssop and sprinkled both the book and
[36:32] all the people to notice what the blood
[36:34] was sprinkled
[36:35] on the book and the people saying this
[36:37] is the blood of the Testament which God
[36:40] hath a joined and joined unto you
[36:43] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[36:45] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[36:47] the ministry and almost all things are
[36:49] by the law purged with blood without
[36:52] shedding of blood there is no remission
[36:54] I mean may the Lord bless his word you
[36:57] may have your seats tonight in the
[36:58] presence of God now the Bible we know
[37:04] the message in the Bible it's more than
[37:06] stories it's more than doctrine but it's
[37:09] a manifestation of a life it's a
[37:12] manifestation of eternal life you know
[37:14] this message brother Brahim says you you
[37:16] know if you listen to Christ as a
[37:17] mystery of God revealed he speaks about
[37:19] how God was unfolding himself all the
[37:22] way down through the lives of believers
[37:23] from from Genesis down into got into
[37:27] this hour and he was revealing his
[37:29] coming and it was expressed in every
[37:31] every type of the Bible the coming of
[37:34] the Lord so it was a life that was
[37:35] manifested you know I was listening to
[37:37] to Christ the mystery of God revealed
[37:39] last weekend in it but this week and I
[37:41] realized Christianity is a life I know
[37:44] as maybe may sound a little bit simple
[37:47] but Christianity is a life manifested
[37:49] that is eternal life that is manifested
[37:52] you know and it's more than just
[37:54] learning a Creed or a Dogma or doctrine
[37:57] but it's a manifestation of a life now
[38:01] the Bible says in Romans chapter 10 it
[38:03] says faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[38:06] of the Word of God now but faith I mean
[38:09] but hearing is not faith but faith
[38:12] cometh by hearing the word so you can
[38:14] audibly hear the word but that won't
[38:16] give you faith it's got to go beyond
[38:19] just hear some decibels ringing
[38:21] some-some air waves moving into your
[38:23] ears but those words have got to enter
[38:25] into your heart and that gives you faith
[38:28] so faith is not hearing but hearing
[38:31] faith cometh by hearing of the word of
[38:33] God okay so it takes more but then when
[38:36] you receive that faith what should it
[38:38] produce it should produce a life and it
[38:41] must produce a life that's all God is
[38:43] interested it is not interested in what
[38:45] we think we know it's him inside of us
[38:48] manifesting himself and brother Pam he
[38:51] speaks in the crisis of mystery Labor's
[38:53] quite a lot upon upon revelation and how
[38:56] divine revelation has been given and it
[38:58] sovereignly given by God to a people I
[39:00] mean just for you to recognize your lost
[39:02] and undone you need salvation that's a
[39:05] revelation I mean that becomes known to
[39:07] you because more than a story that
[39:09] becomes a living reality and you feel a
[39:11] burden of your sin and you are gonna and
[39:13] yes they are going to do something about
[39:15] this and you and the reason that burden
[39:17] comes on is because God has already paid
[39:19] the price he already shed his blood and
[39:21] you've just got to give it to him God
[39:23] you died for me Lord I receive your
[39:25] salvation I mean but it's faith that
[39:27] cometh by hearing and you've got to
[39:29] believe you're a sinner I meant and then
[39:32] you going to believe he can save you and
[39:33] before there is a sinner there was a
[39:35] savior hallelujah so before you a lost
[39:38] there's one that have found you I mean
[39:40] there's one that could find you
[39:41] hallelujah he speaks very quite a lot
[39:45] about how the the church is built upon
[39:48] the rock of Revelation and he would go
[39:51] to Matthew chapter 16 you know the
[39:53] scripture very well where Jesus asked
[39:56] the disciples who do men say that I am
[39:58] and they say some you say your Jeremias
[40:00] or a Liars or what are the prophets but
[40:02] he asked the question who do you say I
[40:04] am and it's the same question I'm I've
[40:07] seen this before but I'm going to say it
[40:09] again it's the same question that's laid
[40:10] before you know who do you say this is I
[40:13] mean who do you say this is that gave
[40:16] the message brother BAM said I wanted to
[40:18] be a trapper I know this is not pure he
[40:21] said he said I don't I didn't want to do
[40:23] this I just wanted to be a trapper but
[40:25] he became a prisoner to the word he does
[40:27] not mean it speaks he sinks it is God
[40:30] that speaks these things but you've got
[40:32] to have that anchor in your soul it's
[40:33] not a man from Kentucky that that
[40:36] learned your divisor a new way of life
[40:39] buts God declaring himself and you've
[40:43] got it really because Christ is the same
[40:44] in every generation but you've got to
[40:47] see him in your generation right so the
[40:51] church is built upon the revelation of
[40:53] who Jesus Christ is
[40:55] I mean so if you know who he is you're
[40:57] built upon the rock hallelujah I trust
[41:00] I'm I'm talking to some people who are
[41:01] not built up
[41:02] on sand of man's ideas that are not
[41:04] connected together like brother Isaac
[41:06] bored out so well I'm having upon the
[41:08] rock one piece hallelujah because of its
[41:11] a rock you know if he is a revelation to
[41:13] you every doctrine is actually one it's
[41:16] not it's not different connecting you
[41:18] know different ideas floating around in
[41:20] a pile but it's one rock and it's a
[41:23] person I mean which is Jesus Christ now
[41:26] but it's very important because you got
[41:29] to understand now what should revelation
[41:32] produce brother Brahim scenes in Christ
[41:34] and mystery God revealed he says it's a
[41:37] personal individual affair with the
[41:39] person that Christ is revealed to them
[41:41] and if you say he's been revealed to me
[41:44] and then the life that Christ produced
[41:46] here in the Bible that same life is in
[41:49] him does not produce itself in you then
[41:52] the wrong revelation Amen if you put a
[41:55] life of a pumpkin into the life of a
[41:56] pear tree it would be a pumpkins by
[41:59] their fruits you shall know them exactly
[42:01] right and if the first you put out you
[42:04] put out of a tree a grapevine it would
[42:07] put out a bunch of grapes the first
[42:09] shooter puts out brought forth grapes
[42:11] the next one brought out lemons leaks on
[42:13] board out peers
[42:14] the next one brought out apples there's
[42:16] some kind of a graph to the fear in
[42:18] there that's bearing its own life every
[42:20] denomination will be a life of itself
[42:22] but if that original vine ever puts
[42:25] forth another shoot it will be a grapes
[42:27] just like the first time so I says now
[42:30] if the river if you say well I've got a
[42:32] revelation what life is producing
[42:34] because it's more than just quoting
[42:36] quotes and quoting scripture and
[42:38] dressing right and acting you're trying
[42:40] to act just right but what life is
[42:42] subconsciously living out amen because
[42:45] the fittest effort is the if you have
[42:47] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it
[42:50] will produce the life that's in the
[42:52] Bible but if you do not have that
[42:54] revelation you have a man my made idea
[42:56] it will not produce the life of the
[42:58] Bible and you have the wrong revelation
[43:00] amen and that is exactly you got to take
[43:04] your life back what is it what is my
[43:06] life presently producing right
[43:08] what is it producing what character what
[43:12] nature do you have we have to have
[43:16] there is one Lord one faith one baptism
[43:18] and we've been restored to that faith
[43:21] hallelujah now I've just got this
[43:24] written in the Bible but brother Bram in
[43:26] the church age book this is not I just
[43:29] wrote this in here cuz I make notes he
[43:32] sees this well I write things down he
[43:35] says this this isn't page 328 of the
[43:40] church age book he says now so wait
[43:42] before I read this Malachi forced me to
[43:45] turn our hearts back to the original
[43:46] faith the anointing that was in the
[43:48] Prophet is to turn us back to the
[43:50] original faith because it's the
[43:52] anointing as the Ministry of Elijah
[43:54] turns the people from one thing to
[43:56] another
[43:57] when Elijah came the first time and it
[44:00] was on Mount Carmel that says he rebuilt
[44:02] the altar of the Lord because that
[44:04] remember an altar in the Bible is an
[44:06] approach to God if you make the right
[44:08] kind of altar the right kind of
[44:10] sacrifice you can approach God the right
[44:11] way in the Old Testament and it says I'm
[44:14] outcome well he rebuilt the older so it
[44:16] was there but it wasn't neglected and it
[44:18] fell down you know and to enter a period
[44:20] he put the sacrifice on and the water
[44:22] and everything that he did he says Lord
[44:24] let them know that thou art God and I've
[44:28] done this according to your word and now
[44:29] has turned their hearts back again it
[44:31] says he prays those exact words and you
[44:34] read him first kings thou turn their
[44:35] heart back again then the fire fell holy
[44:38] and then they saw her really was God
[44:40] amen and it's the same thing that's the
[44:43] same thing happened in this day I mean
[44:45] the the right approach to God was
[44:47] rebuilt the altar was rebuilt
[44:49] I mean stone upon stone of Revelation
[44:51] then you've got to lay yourself upon
[44:53] that and you've got to die and the fires
[44:55] gonna come down and consume you that's
[44:59] what it has to happen you can't just lay
[45:00] there on the altar it's no longer I that
[45:08] liveth but Christ liveth in me it must
[45:10] be that way and John the Baptist he
[45:13] turned the hearts of thee of the
[45:14] father's to the children there's a
[45:16] turning going on now what caused the
[45:19] turning there was the word that was
[45:21] preached caused attorney well you know
[45:24] John the Baptist he preached he said the
[45:27] ax is laid to the root of the tree he
[45:29] didn't say just
[45:30] have you ever seen a big big tree trunk
[45:32] is one actually in taro a massive tree
[45:35] trunk and a little trees growing out of
[45:37] the tree trunk I don't know what wrote
[45:40] it so it's a massive tree trying this
[45:41] little thing Greg that's been cut off
[45:43] with his little than growing up what's
[45:44] happened the roots the X wasn't late to
[45:46] the roof it was just late to the truck
[45:48] see he was saying you say you had a grub
[45:50] out you got to get rid of the whole
[45:51] thing
[45:52] yeah heck out the whole thing every tree
[45:55] that doesn't bring forth fruits can be
[45:56] cast into the fire and those words was
[45:59] just as good today as they were back
[46:00] then but he began to preach the coming
[46:02] of the laws at hand was and then what
[46:04] happened hearts were being turned by the
[46:06] anointing that traveled on the word that
[46:08] he released now he says in the church
[46:12] age book now this messenger of Malachi 4
[46:14] and revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[46:17] things number one according to Malachi 4
[46:21] he'll turn the hearts of the children to
[46:26] the father's and He will reveal the
[46:28] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[46:30] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[46:33] contained in the seven seals it will be
[46:36] these two finally revealed mystery
[46:37] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[46:40] the children through the Pentecostal
[46:42] fathers here's exactly so now that
[46:46] doesn't mean you've got to you know
[46:48] understand what doctrine is but there's
[46:51] a there's an anointing in the word right
[46:53] there's an anointing that that's
[46:55] released in the end time that's why it's
[46:57] more than understanding you know it's
[46:59] like even the Apostles they heard the
[47:01] preaching of John the Baptist and their
[47:03] and their heart was turned their heart
[47:06] was turned because they left what they
[47:07] did and they started following John and
[47:10] then John pointed out the Lamb of God
[47:12] they started following him and then
[47:14] after John was in prison his head was
[47:16] cut off
[47:16] they said shouldn't Elias must first
[47:19] come and he and Jesus says he's come
[47:22] already you didn't even know who it was
[47:23] it says then they knew it was John the
[47:25] Baptist they didn't even understand now
[47:27] oh this is John this was the forerunner
[47:30] but their life came under an influence
[47:32] and their heart was turned they lived
[47:35] out the fulfillment of John's ministry
[47:37] hallelujah and they didn't even know
[47:40] hallelujah that's how important it is
[47:42] Spirit of God begins to move and people
[47:45] that before you even if we consciously
[47:47] realize I'm being turned I'm walking a
[47:50] different Road God's got ahold of me
[47:52] hallelujah isn't that amazing if they
[47:55] didn't even fully he got read it in the
[47:57] Bible they actually asked Jesus isn't
[47:59] Elijah mean to first come and they have
[48:01] actually the very purpose of his
[48:03] ministry
[48:03] therefore filth because they're
[48:05] following the Messiah
[48:06] what happened because his anointing
[48:09] released in his preaching and turn their
[48:11] hearts now and this is the same with the
[48:15] with the word that's come open now
[48:17] there's an anointing in that word and it
[48:20] literally will turn our hearts back to
[48:22] the faith of the fathers exactly so and
[48:25] I'll declare it tonight if you haven't
[48:27] realized you know if you've really come
[48:29] under the influence of the Holy Spirit
[48:31] and your life has been changed not even
[48:34] you're doing it's his doing
[48:35] it's your tense desire not even your
[48:37] desire and your life is changing and
[48:39] look back and say I was going this way
[48:41] then my life turned sideways and walking
[48:43] this way and following the pillar of
[48:45] fire into a rapture you got to realize
[48:47] your hearts been turned I mean that your
[48:50] heart has been turned the original faith
[48:52] hallelujah how that's happening - we
[48:55] haven't been we're not in the we're not
[48:56] in the process of the turning the
[48:58] bride's heart has been turned hallelujah
[49:01] it's like brother Barry comes down to
[49:03] the end of his ministry he's talking
[49:04] about you know anyone can lay a wall
[49:07] you're a brick you're a brick like and
[49:09] Larry wall takes a Master Mason to turn
[49:11] the corner and then he comes to the end
[49:14] near the universe mercy says now we're
[49:16] turning the corner and at the end like
[49:18] in leadership he says now we've turned
[49:19] the corner and with hearing heaven on
[49:21] the face how Louie's try to tell you
[49:24] this is where you are your roadmap I
[49:25] mean you can see because this is why the
[49:28] Prophet came oh I love it so much this
[49:30] is a road map it's a love letter and a
[49:32] road map where we're led by divine love
[49:34] there's a road map but if you don't know
[49:36] where you are on a map how can you find
[49:38] out we have to get to it's like if you
[49:41] gave me a map of Wellington I didn't
[49:43] really know Wellington all that well and
[49:44] say you just got to travel there just
[49:46] say you got to get Tootsie Pop or
[49:48] someplace this is your destination but
[49:50] then you got to say but where am I
[49:51] cutting from because otherwise you'll be
[49:54] wandering around trying to find a
[49:55] landmark some way to see where you are
[49:57] that's why God send a messenger in this
[49:59] day this is where you are on the roadmap
[50:01] this is your destination
[50:03] I mean we've turned a corner we're
[50:05] steering heaven on the face just keep
[50:07] walking children and you'll be there
[50:09] hallelujah sour hearts have been turned
[50:12] amen now and it's produced this word is
[50:17] producing a character and a people never
[50:20] belittle what God has done for you and
[50:22] what he is doing
[50:23] Alleluia now whenever people come under
[50:27] an influence of of of the anointing and
[50:30] the age it is to fulfill something now
[50:33] we read we read how Moses Paul is
[50:38] speaking about Moses he he sprinkles the
[50:41] book he sprinkles the people with the
[50:43] blood and saying this is the new this is
[50:45] the covenant which God has enjoined to
[50:47] you so there was a word now this law
[50:50] this law remember there was actually I
[50:52] know it's I know we view the law as a
[50:55] negative thing in surely and it's just a
[50:57] policeman that just puts us in jail but
[51:00] there's power in that law under the
[51:02] blood of bulls and goats they had power
[51:05] Moses Moses overthrew a through a
[51:09] kingdom under the blood of bulls and
[51:11] goats Caleb took his mountain under the
[51:14] blood of bulls and goats joshua said sun
[51:16] and sun and moon stand still under the
[51:18] blood of bulls and goats
[51:19] I mean Gideon's three hundred you know
[51:22] had a mighty victory under the blood of
[51:24] bulls and goats Elisha you know totally
[51:27] destroyed the prophets of bail under the
[51:29] blood of bulls and goats hello Lou you
[51:31] can just keep going down through the Old
[51:32] Testament that's under the blood of
[51:33] bulls and goats under the blood of bulls
[51:35] and goats here Zak I was under the blood
[51:37] of bulls and goats hallelujah they were
[51:39] just this is a shadow so there was power
[51:41] in that words
[51:42] yes param that word and God was and
[51:44] joining by a sacrifice he was he was
[51:48] connecting the people with that law
[51:49] saying you cannot be separated anymore
[51:52] the blood has joined you in the book
[51:54] together
[51:55] hallelujah member the part of the book
[51:57] he really wore them to be is you'll
[51:59] dwell in your land
[52:00] you'll be my people at all be your God
[52:02] that was
[52:03] whole purpose of the law I'm going to
[52:05] place you in your inheritance I'm going
[52:07] to walk among you hallelujah I'm going
[52:09] to cover your sin by the blood of bulls
[52:10] and goats I mean why don't chase a
[52:12] thousand to chase ten thousand
[52:14] hallelujah that was the purpose of the
[52:16] law hallelujah under the blood of bulls
[52:18] and goats say Amen David took the whole
[52:21] land under the blood of bulls you guys I
[52:23] know the blood of bulls ago Solomon
[52:25] built the temple and they at peace
[52:27] hallelujah
[52:29] so he connected it and then the sort of
[52:30] people that really receives like Caleb
[52:33] and Joshua I mean out of their
[52:35] generation something happened to them we
[52:38] are more than able that's God but once
[52:40] they saw the obstacles they saw the
[52:42] Giants they saw the walled cities I mean
[52:45] they saw the same things that the other
[52:46] spy saw but the other spy said we cannot
[52:49] take it and they said God has given it
[52:52] to us let's go up at once under the
[52:54] blood of bulls and goats I mean because
[52:56] that law Amy wasn't joined to them by
[53:00] the blood I mean that they would fulfill
[53:02] what that law did the purpose of the law
[53:05] was they would be in their land and be
[53:07] living with God even though God was
[53:10] separated from him you know he couldn't
[53:12] come into the into them like us there
[53:14] was a separation but God wanted his
[53:16] people he wanted to be among his people
[53:18] hey follow me that was the purpose of
[53:20] the law hallelujah that's what God came
[53:23] you okay came to Moses and they gave the
[53:25] law and it'll yo because God wanted to
[53:27] walk walk among them hallelujah so it
[53:30] was those Caleb and you can't just you

[53:48] and I you know there's easier maybe I
[53:50] don't know what but there's something in
[53:52] us assist I don't care what this world

[1:01:27] and that's why it's so glorious this
[1:01:29] message is the receiving it's not
[1:01:31] doctrine it's Christ receiving it a
[1:01:34] bride I many seem to work to make it
[1:01:36] with that spot or wrinkle
[1:01:38] I mean to manifest the victory of
[1:01:40] Calvary and we see that victory in our
[1:01:42] lives I trust you do we can you can look

[1:02:09] because remember we're washed by the
[1:02:10] water of the work that's not that's not
[1:02:14] man's word that's God's word when God
[1:02:17] speaks through a ministry through his
[1:02:19] Bible through the messages God speaking
[1:02:21] the voice of many waters it says and
[1:02:24] that voice is the voice of the ministry
[1:02:25] crying out hello Lee crying out against
[1:02:28] wrong shot in the real way showing the
[1:02:31] way the truth and the life

[1:03:11] that where I am know what you are where
[1:03:14] he is
[1:03:15] hallelujah Amen so this message is Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ it's not doctrine it's not a
[1:03:24] prophets idea it's Jesus Christ
[1:03:27] declaring himself it's the son of man
[1:03:30] revealing himself and the day when you
[1:03:32] see sodom and gomorrah on the streets in
[1:03:33] the days of lot you know in the days of
[1:03:35] Noah so shall be when the Son of Man is
[1:03:38] revealed and we live in that day amen
[1:03:42] where we're living in the root of time
[1:03:43] of the revealing of the son of man and
[1:03:44] it was revealed it was revealed that a
[1:03:47] prophets ministry let's go to Jude
[1:03:49] errata me I think 29 this is one of my
[1:03:52] favorite favorite scriptures I think
[1:03:57] I'll say that every time but hey I like
[1:03:59] it all
[1:04:06] oh dear that's where I get a bit undone
[1:04:09] oh yes it is do you draw two not one
[1:04:15] so remember G Dharana me is Moses giving
[1:04:19] like his last sermon to the people and
[1:04:22] he's about to go up the mountain and die
[1:04:23] so this is they've had 40 years they've
[1:04:27] walked with God 40 years they're at a 40
[1:04:29] year journey from Egypt to this point
[1:04:31] the people have and it says these are
[1:04:35] the words of the Covenant which the LORD
[1:04:38] commanded Moses to make with the
[1:04:40] children of Israel in the land of Moab
[1:04:41] beside the Covenant which he made with
[1:04:43] them in Horeb and Moses called unto all
[1:04:46] Israel and said unto them ye have seen
[1:04:49] all that the Lord did before your eyes
[1:04:50] and land of Egypt under Pharaoh and unto
[1:04:53] all the servants and to and unto all his
[1:04:55] land the great temptations which thine
[1:04:57] eyes have seen the signs and those great
[1:05:00] miracles yet God has not given you a
[1:05:03] heart to perceive and eyes to see and
[1:05:06] ears to hear and to this day and I have
[1:05:12] led you 40 years in the wilderness your
[1:05:13] clothes are not waxen old upon you thy
[1:05:15] shoe is not waxing old upon thy foot you
[1:05:17] have not eaten bread neither have you
[1:05:19] drink wine or strong drink that you
[1:05:21] might know that I am the Lord your God
[1:05:23] so they had been walking forty years and
[1:05:26] you were to think before this moment
[1:05:29] they would have thought I understand it
[1:05:30] we've been 40 years in this message
[1:05:33] we've been racing this message our
[1:05:36] grandchildren maybe maybe that I don't
[1:05:38] yeah maybe they had grandchildren as
[1:05:40] well well even just children Wisco
[1:05:41] children the children say I've been
[1:05:43] racing this message I've been racing
[1:05:45] this wilderness I don't know what Egypt
[1:05:47] is I was born outside of Egypt and they
[1:05:51] would think I've heard it all I
[1:05:52] understand it all but most say no God
[1:05:54] hasn't given you a heart to have to
[1:05:56] perceive is to hear eyes to see until
[1:05:58] this day because as we walk with God he
[1:06:00] opens his word to us he opens his word
[1:06:03] for every stage of the journey and as we
[1:06:05] walk with him he reveals himself amen
[1:06:09] that's why it's more alive today than it
[1:06:11] was you know when it was even first
[1:06:14] preached many people
[1:06:15] you look waiting food for the
[1:06:17] discernment and the miracles and all
[1:06:18] these things and he God was revealing
[1:06:20] himself through his word sir a prophet
[1:06:22] he was declaring things and many people
[1:06:25] didn't catch it then why because it had
[1:06:26] to be a time where God where the people
[1:06:29] walked with God themselves where the
[1:06:31] Prophet was taken out of the way that
[1:06:32] the people could walk with God
[1:06:33] themselves hallelujah so that's why now
[1:06:36] the wood becomes more love and I pray it
[1:06:39] does to you this message is so much more
[1:06:41] alive to me then now than it was ten
[1:06:43] years ago
[1:06:44] Amen that means more to me hallelujah
[1:06:47] just gotta dig it and have a face
[1:06:48] I mean why just take a little bit of a
[1:06:51] roast wouldn't get the whole leg
[1:06:52] hallelujah watching amen have the whole
[1:06:55] buffet I'll just take a nurse is the
[1:07:00] shift take the whole thing what's wrong
[1:07:02] with my cooking what's what a chef would
[1:07:05] say try it oh yeah I want you in heaven
[1:07:08] oh and God wants you to get into it to
[1:07:11] enjoy it's for you I meant this word
[1:07:14] this is God's covenant being declared
[1:07:16] hallelujah Amen so it gives them
[1:07:20] overcoming power the word gave Caleb and
[1:07:22] Joshua
[1:07:23] it was enjoined to them by faith by the
[1:07:27] blood of the bulls and goats and they
[1:07:30] became one with the promise and they
[1:07:31] manifested their promise amen that was
[1:07:34] under the blood of bulls and goats now
[1:07:36] here we are here we are in the cellar
[1:07:41] it's a wonderful day because we live in
[1:07:47] a time where if we go to revelations
[1:07:51] chapter 10 there has to come a time
[1:07:54] where we become one with the promise we
[1:07:57] don't just look upon it we don't just
[1:08:00] say well brother Branham says and talk
[1:08:02] about his testimonies to pass on else's
[1:08:04] testimonies but that same life that was
[1:08:06] in him which was in Jesus Christ
[1:08:08] manifests into you and then it's no
[1:08:11] longer someone else's story it becomes
[1:08:13] your story there's no longer someone
[1:08:15] else's testimony it becomes your
[1:08:16] testimony so it doesn't become someone
[1:08:18] else's promise or someone else's
[1:08:20] covenant with God it becomes your
[1:08:22] promise in covenant with God I mean
[1:08:24] because remember it was every it was
[1:08:26] even in the Old Testament yes there's
[1:08:29] half the tribe of manasseh and some
[1:08:31] other tribes they settled on the east of
[1:08:34] Jordan some of them did who knows the
[1:08:36] Bible some of them did but then when
[1:08:38] they went to take the land those ones
[1:08:40] that are read sealed in their position
[1:08:42] went forth before everyone armed so they
[1:08:45] went forth to help their brethren take
[1:08:47] their inheritance amen and that is now
[1:08:50] the burden of those who know him because
[1:08:52] life has to go forth I mean last time
[1:08:54] life just can't be contained you see in
[1:08:56] life you see when spring comes you know
[1:08:58] the Sun comes a little bit closer to our
[1:09:00] side of the earth and you know the soil
[1:09:02] temperature gets a bit warmer and the
[1:09:04] days get longer and life comes for you
[1:09:06] can't stop it coming forth it must come
[1:09:08] forth it's the same thing with eternal
[1:09:10] life it must go forth I mean you can't
[1:09:12] bottle up brother Brown said it's like
[1:09:14] it's like a house on fire in a windy day
[1:09:15] I mean you can't put it out you might
[1:09:18] just spread it
[1:09:19] I mean spread the fire that's just like
[1:09:23] the believer that's why the 120 in the
[1:09:25] Upper Room when God came into them
[1:09:27] eternal life doesn't the bosom of the
[1:09:29] father and it was manifested to them
[1:09:31] they didn't just say well praise God
[1:09:33] hallelujah licious they should stay here
[1:09:35] another day now they ran out of that
[1:09:37] place
[1:09:37] they said this is that spoken by the
[1:09:39] Prophet Joel probably in the last week
[1:09:41] forth and he's the same today as he was
[1:09:44] big you can't you can't help it there's
[1:09:47] something in you saying people have got
[1:09:49] to receive this you say well I don't
[1:09:51] know how to put the words to it just
[1:09:53] tell them how your candle got lit tell
[1:09:55] them what became real to you because
[1:09:57] when you test the five things have
[1:09:58] become real to you it becomes even more
[1:10:00] lives
[1:10:01] Amen there's power and testimony yes
[1:10:05] revelations 10 and we'll read from verse
[1:10:09] well we won't read the whole thing
[1:10:11] because I think time is escaping us but
[1:10:12] you read the whole thing many people
[1:10:14] like to just talk about revelations 10 1
[1:10:17] 1 to 7 where the covenant angel comes
[1:10:20] down with the open book you know it says
[1:10:23] but the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:10:24] angel verse 7 with all the mysteries
[1:10:26] when he should begin to sound the
[1:10:27] mysteries of God should be finished as
[1:10:29] he has to clear those servants the
[1:10:30] prophets but that's not the whole
[1:10:31] chapter they start the whole chapter
[1:10:34] that's been fulfilled that same angel
[1:10:37] that came down that's the Holy Ghost
[1:10:38] coming there's all symbolic it's not
[1:10:40] it's not something else
[1:10:42] then because the same Holy Ghost that
[1:10:43] came on the day of Pentecost was the
[1:10:45] same Holy Ghost that led Moses and the
[1:10:47] Israelites from Egypt to the promised
[1:10:49] land you read in Hebrews 11 that Moses
[1:10:51] forsook Egypt to follow Christ that's
[1:10:54] the same God that's the same God Malachi
[1:10:56] 3:1 says I'll save my mission before my
[1:10:59] face and he'll prepare the way before me
[1:11:01] and the Angel of the Covenant whom you
[1:11:03] delight and shall suddenly come to his
[1:11:05] temple whose angel the Covenant the same
[1:11:07] one that led them from Egypt to the
[1:11:08] promised land which is Christ which
[1:11:10] Moses followed and that same God was in
[1:11:12] the fullness of his manifestation in
[1:11:14] Jesus Christ and went into 120 the upper
[1:11:16] room and went forth same God not a
[1:11:19] different one I'm it's like this mighty
[1:11:21] angel the same angel the Covenant comes
[1:11:23] down upon the earth hallelujah because
[1:11:25] he wants to know the promise the promise
[1:11:28] of a restoration amen of Adam and Eve on
[1:11:32] the earth again
[1:11:33] Adams been the second Adam was
[1:11:34] manifested as Jesus Christ but there's
[1:11:36] got to be a second Eve both of em talks
[1:11:39] about the bride as the second part of
[1:11:40] the masterpiece hallelujah so she's got
[1:11:43] to be upon the earth member to life if
[1:11:45] you've got the wrong revelation you
[1:11:47] won't produce the right life but if you
[1:11:49] have the right revelation you'll produce
[1:11:50] a life of Christ amen it's got to be the
[1:11:53] same life and the husband as in the wife
[1:11:55] hallelujah so now that's what it must be
[1:11:57] oh my okay so now this angel comes down
[1:12:02] with his open book but then in
[1:12:05] Revelations 10 8 it says in the voice
[1:12:07] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:12:09] again now remember John I'll just read
[1:12:11] it again he says go take the little book
[1:12:14] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:12:16] which standeth upon the scene upon the
[1:12:18] earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:12:20] unto him give me the little book me but
[1:12:23] this is this this angel is Christ
[1:12:25] himself right the the one that stands
[1:12:28] upon the sea and the earth this is the
[1:12:29] Covenant angel there's all symbolic
[1:12:31] remember we're not literally eating bits
[1:12:34] of Indian paper with ink on them right
[1:12:36] it's all symbolic okay and I went to the
[1:12:39] angel and sehun to me give me the little
[1:12:41] book and he said unto me take it eat it
[1:12:43] up
[1:12:43] and it shall make thy belly bitter and
[1:12:45] it shall be in thy mouth sweetest honey
[1:12:47] and I took the little book out of the
[1:12:49] Angels hand and ate it up and it was in
[1:12:51] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as
[1:12:53] I'd eaten it my belly was bitter why cuz
[1:12:55] purging out of your life and he said
[1:12:57] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[1:13:01] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:13:03] kings
[1:13:03] now John himself after he wrote the book
[1:13:07] of Revelation after the book of
[1:13:08] Revelation came to him he what history
[1:13:10] says he was released from Patmos he went
[1:13:12] back to Ephesus and he pastored the
[1:13:13] church until he died he didn't he didn't
[1:13:16] fulfill the scripture John and the book
[1:13:18] of Revelation is a symbol himself and
[1:13:21] John is a symbol of you John is a symbol
[1:13:25] of you that's why that's why I chapter
[1:13:27] one it shows where you are because it's
[1:13:29] John and he hears a voice behind him he
[1:13:32] turns he sees seven golden candlesticks
[1:13:34] and the Son of man walking between the
[1:13:36] seven churches so it's after the seventh
[1:13:39] at the end of the seventh church age
[1:13:40] he's gone past there and he turns back
[1:13:42] and God biggest revealed to him this is
[1:13:45] where you've been then after the latest
[1:13:47] in church age he hears a voice in heaven
[1:13:48] saying come up hither I'll show you
[1:13:50] things that must come to pass and he and
[1:13:52] it's a rapture of the church revelations
[1:13:54] four and one right and so he's raptured
[1:13:57] up after the end of the seventh age
[1:13:58] hello this is where you are on the map
[1:14:01] right this is where you are on the map
[1:14:03] and so now John is a symbol in the book
[1:14:06] and so John is told take this take this
