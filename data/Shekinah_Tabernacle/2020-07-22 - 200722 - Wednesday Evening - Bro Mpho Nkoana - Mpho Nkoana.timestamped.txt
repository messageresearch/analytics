[27:50] god's people amen
[27:52] so
[27:53] while we're standing i'm not sure if my
[27:56] volume is okay
[27:58] and
[27:59] but while we're standing
[28:00] we are going to read the scripture in
[28:02] the book of first corinthians amen
[28:05] i trust that we have had a good day a
[28:07] good week so far
[28:09] you know with a believer
[28:11] is what we call evergreen
[28:16] with a believer we are we are an
[28:18] evergreen project amen we're not
[28:22] up and down there is up and downs but we
[28:24] are above that we are an ever green
[28:27] project of the lord jesus christ
[28:29] hallelujah so we'll read the first
[28:31] corinthians
[28:32] um chapter 11 again
[28:36] and i want someone who's got a sharp
[28:38] memory
[28:39] someone who
[28:41] can remember things
[28:44] where we ended last time when we spoke
[28:46] about descending the body of the lord
[28:48] amen how many remembers
[28:52] um
[28:54] first corinthians chapter 11
[28:57] and then we'll read from verse 25 amen
[29:00] once you are there please just say amen
[29:03] amen try to be as quick as possible
[29:08] redeeming our time seeing that time is
[29:10] no more amen
[29:12] 25 after the same manner also he took
[29:15] the cup
[29:16] and when he had stopped saying this cup
[29:18] is the new testament in my blood
[29:21] this dewey as oft as he drink it
[29:24] in remembrance of me amen
[29:26] this is a communal scripture but i said
[29:29] last time we are not going to eat
[29:30] communion but we are going to be in the
[29:32] communion tonight
[29:33] for as often as he eat this bread and
[29:36] drink this cup he do show the lord's
[29:39] death till he come
[29:41] wherefore whosoever shall
[29:45] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[29:48] lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[29:52] body and blood of the lord amen
[29:56] and
[29:57] verse 20
[29:59] 8 but let a man examine himself and so
[30:02] let him eat
[30:04] of that bread and drink of that cup
[30:06] after examination are we together
[30:09] for he he that drink that eateth and
[30:13] drink it unworthily
[30:15] eaten and drinketh damnation to himself
[30:18] not descending the lord's body
[30:21] do you remember this
[30:22] so i must examine myself
[30:25] each one of you must examine themselves
[30:28] not using your own answer sheet but
[30:30] using the question paper using the the
[30:34] script
[30:36] using the the great uh
[30:39] uh what does the prophet call it
[30:42] you know using using the the word
[30:45] assessing yourself amen doing what you
[30:47] call a word test for yourself before you
[30:50] can drink and eat the bread
[30:53] you must be ready right
[30:55] and don't not do it unwittingly but yes
[30:58] i want us to speak more on the spiritual
[31:00] realm
[31:01] so verse 29
[31:04] says
[31:05] um for for for he that eateth and drink
[31:08] it unworthily
[31:10] eat it and drink it damnation to himself
[31:12] not descending the lord's body so it's
[31:14] important to descend the lord's body
[31:16] listen to verse 30
[31:18] for this course for this thing of eating
[31:21] and drinking unworthily
[31:23] for this thing of not examining
[31:24] ourselves
[31:26] many are weak
[31:29] and sickly among you and many sleep
[31:34] i don't think the bible speaks about
[31:35] just sleeping at home
[31:37] you know
[31:38] this is a spiritual sleepless slumber
[31:42] the bible is talking about let's pray
[31:44] once more
[31:45] lord jesus we just wanna
[31:47] thank you again for your weight that we
[31:48] have read
[31:49] please inspire it lord
[31:51] please anoint it
[31:53] that it can bless your people
[31:55] we know that you say these things
[31:58] to a let us to motivate us
[32:01] to remind us lord we you have already
[32:05] chosen us but lord you don't want to
[32:07] lose us therefore you mitigate every
[32:10] risk
[32:11] to tell us what we ought to do in this
[32:13] day and age you commit your weight you
[32:15] commit your people hear us and the
[32:17] speaker alike in the name of our lord
[32:19] jesus christ amen
[32:22] please enjoy the comfort of your seats
[32:25] while i remain standing amen so we have
[32:28] read there in
[32:30] that we we realize the importance of
[32:33] checking ourselves we realize the
[32:35] importance of examining ourselves
[32:37] the bible says if your heart condemns
[32:39] you not
[32:41] that means god has put something in us
[32:43] to help us to examine ourselves
[32:46] therefore we can we must not be rigid
[32:49] right we must be pliable you know when
[32:52] something is playable you know what he's
[32:54] he's the potter i am the clay so he mold

[35:33] spirit
[35:34] because it's inside you your body so it
[35:37] means that in as much as we are not
[35:39] focused on the physical body but our
[35:41] physical body our spiritual body our
[35:44] soul they are all interjoined
[35:47] they all have an impact one to the other
[35:50] just life is a church right some are
[35:52] brothers some are sisters some are
[35:54] deacons some are trustees some are
[35:56] pastors some are teachers some are prof
[35:59] uh
[36:00] prophet
[36:01] we have prophets no but they've got
[36:02] gifts of prophecy
[36:04] so all those different gifts and
[36:06] positions but we are all one body right
[36:09] so the message is that
[36:12] there's somebody who is inside us as a
[36:15] church
[36:16] there's somebody who's inside you as a
[36:17] church you as an individual
[36:20] who is your pastor as an individual
[36:23] right he's he's your leader he's your
[36:25] pastor he's guiding you the bible says
[36:28] he leads you everywhere right so that
[36:30] person is the holy spirit he is housed
[36:33] inside you you don't do things of your
[36:35] own
[36:36] right therefore
[36:38] the bible says invest uh
[36:40] oh yeah let me finish that verse first
[36:42] what now you know that your body is the
[36:44] temple of the holy ghost which is in you
[36:47] which he have of god and he are not your
[36:50] own
[36:52] you don't belong to yourself
[36:55] that that reminds me of the sermon of
[36:57] pride
[36:59] that same one i was not here but when i
[37:01] listened to it man i said lord humble me
[37:03] you know god does not love a proud heart
[37:07] and now the devil because he's and i'm
[37:08] deviating now but the devil because he's
[37:11] so proud
[37:12] uh
[37:13] he realized that if he gives us pride
[37:16] openly and bring it and paint it on us
[37:19] openly the way that he did in heaven he
[37:22] realized that we've got enough
[37:23] revelation to pick him up so what he
[37:26] does he he's so subtle
[37:29] he's so subtle and pride
[37:32] i don't know i don't want to preach the
[37:33] same one again
[37:34] but it's such a subtle thing sometimes
[37:37] especially to a believer he comes in
[37:39] ways that we may not detect
[37:41] and you find yourself being a proud
[37:43] person and away
[37:45] so we need to check that and listen to
[37:47] that same one again and be very careful
[37:49] amen but that's 20 this is where i am
[37:52] going i don't know why i went there
[37:54] verse 20 or first corinthians 6
[37:57] 4
[37:58] we are
[37:59] born with a price
[38:03] you are bored with a price your husband
[38:06] has paid dowry but you call it lovola in
[38:10] my language he has paid a price
[38:13] just like isaac did when they sent
[38:15] eleazar he paid a great price
[38:19] there's no
[38:20] amount of money gold silver that can buy
[38:24] you
[38:25] so so so even though you are a wife he
[38:28] brought all sorts of gifts and gave you
[38:31] thank you for that someone brother
[38:32] marion you know and then
[38:34] he he he brought gifts
[38:37] for you
[38:38] he brought everything but the biggest
[38:40] gift that he brought was his life
[38:43] our father
[38:45] demanded life
[38:47] to pay for this bride
[38:49] so he left everything and he came down
[38:51] that is why he says you are bored with
[38:53] your price
[38:54] therefore glorify god in your body
[38:58] every fiber
[38:59] every neuron
[39:01] every nerve every piece of hair every
[39:04] everything in your body
[39:06] mass give glory
[39:08] to god amen
[39:10] that means every piece of a shakkaina
[39:12] tabernacle
[39:13] every leg every hand every mouth every
[39:16] teeth every toe of this body
[39:20] must bring glory to
[39:22] god
[39:23] i have never seen a body
[39:25] that fight against itself we'll get
[39:27] there just now
[39:29] i want us to focus tonight at
[39:32] just two or three questions why is it
[39:34] important to descend the body of the
[39:36] lord why
[39:38] why is it so important
[39:41] right we need to know how it works to
[39:44] understand the functionalities of this
[39:46] body of the lord because the body of the
[39:48] lord is not just in new zealand
[39:51] the body of the lord is not just in
[39:53] south africa the body of the lord is not
[39:55] just in combat cambodia or vietnam or
[39:58] china or
[40:00] singapore or south korea no
[40:03] the body of the lord is across the globe
[40:07] amen
[40:08] it is
[40:08] um and what what what i did i always
[40:12] forget this weight
[40:15] a universal
[40:17] and um
[40:19] mystical thank you it's a mystical
[40:22] body
[40:24] of the bride of the lord so
[40:27] now it has got functions it has got
[40:29] things that it does and if you have the
[40:31] revelation how that body works you will
[40:34] work very seamlessly you you live very
[40:37] easily right you the body will never
[40:40] work against itself and the moment you
[40:42] understand how the body works you've got
[40:45] no problem
[40:46] you're not gonna go eat something like i
[40:48] said last time that you know when you
[40:49] eat it you react you're not going to do
[40:52] that because you know you understand
[40:54] your body that you
[40:56] you wake up late you sleep late
[40:59] that you like brother cuban you are in
[41:01] any riser if you are an early riser
[41:03] therefore you can't sleep like at 12
[41:05] like me
[41:08] or at one because you know you're an
[41:10] early riser you know my body's routine
[41:13] is this way
[41:15] you know that if i eat this i get
[41:18] constipation
[41:19] you know that oh you you understand you
[41:22] got you can't understand how your body
[41:24] functions so spiritually we must have
[41:26] spiritual eyes to know how the body of
[41:29] the lord works to understand
[41:32] that we are not dealing with humans here
[41:34] you are dealing with the bride of the
[41:37] living god which was bought by a great
[41:39] price including you
[41:41] hallelujah thank you
[41:43] why is it so important to understand the
[41:45] body of the lord do you understand you
[41:47] you need to understand
[41:49] the greater the bigger picture the
[41:52] vision of the king there's a song that
[41:54] says don't lose
[41:57] your vision
[42:00] of jesus
[42:01] [Music]
[42:03] keep your eyes on him amen because many
[42:06] brothers and sisters have gone by the
[42:08] wayside they lost their view their focus
[42:12] and their vision and how the devil works
[42:14] he makes you to misunderstand
[42:17] things and put them carnally in our mind
[42:19] and you lose the meaning of the body yo
[42:23] imagine if my my hand just decided to
[42:26] leave me
[42:28] you you are you are affecting the body
[42:31] if you are working against the body all
[42:33] right okay let's move on
[42:35] matthew 12 it says and jesus knew their
[42:37] thoughts and he said unto them every
[42:40] kingdom divided against itself is
[42:42] brought into desolation
[42:44] and every city or house divided against
[42:47] itself shall not stand
[42:49] you must understand that we are a body
[42:52] and you are a body
[42:54] right and we are a global mystical body
[42:57] of the lord and
[42:58] how they gives you know that's why when
[43:00] you pray and the spirit comes down to
[43:02] you you will find yourself even praying
[43:04] for people that you have never met
[43:06] because they are part of you spiritually
[43:08] you intern link with them you are part
[43:10] and parcel of the greater body of the
[43:13] lord hallelujah
[43:15] mark chapter 3 he says and if a house be
[43:18] divided against itself
[43:20] that house cannot stand
[43:24] can it stand
[43:25] this was after when they saw the lord
[43:27] jesus christ rebuking an evil spirit
[43:30] that came out of a girl
[43:31] or a person and then they said he uses
[43:34] the the head of demons he's using the
[43:36] king of demons called belzebab this
[43:39] story comes from there so he was asking
[43:41] them
[43:42] how can i
[43:44] be the head of the devils then cast the
[43:47] devil out because the devil works with
[43:49] the devil in harmony
[43:51] they don't work against each other they
[43:54] can because of the nature and
[43:55] personality of those demons they can
[43:57] conflict and this but but but on a
[44:00] bigger scale of things on a bigger
[44:02] scheme demons work with demons in
[44:04] harmony
[44:06] therefore believers and believers work
[44:08] together in harmony because they've got
[44:10] the same spirit yes
[44:12] yes
[44:14] the prophet in that message three
[44:15] witnesses he says if he
[44:18] if if
[44:19] if he can show me what's wrong with
[44:22] people in their lives
[44:24] he can show me where to go
[44:26] what to do how long to stay i've seen
[44:29] i've seen so tied up i've been so tied
[44:32] up though i've got it into i got into
[44:36] well at first when i left the baptist
[44:38] church to be interdenominational to help
[44:41] bring the brethren together to do all
[44:44] that i could see
[44:46] i believe that we are all we were all
[44:49] brethren in christ and i don't believe
[44:52] we should be separated
[44:54] it's all right to have different
[44:56] churches own little beliefs but that
[44:59] does not that it isn't a fundamental
[45:02] part the thing is of it is
[45:05] we are brethren see we are together
[45:09] we are all born into one body
[45:12] that's the message that's the main thing
[45:14] that we need to understand right that
[45:16] when my brother feels the pain
[45:19] i must feel it with you
[45:21] when you pray for someone who's got
[45:23] cancer you pray as if that cancer is
[45:26] busy eating you
[45:28] just like when my brother buys a
[45:29] mercedes and he puts me in the mercedes
[45:31] to drive with me i'm so happy i'm
[45:33] enjoying the car it's like it's my it's
[45:35] my car
[45:38] you see i don't mean brother andy i mean
[45:40] any other one
[45:41] you understand what i mean i get you get
[45:44] happy genuinely
[45:46] you get fat you get affected genuinely
[45:49] yeah
[45:50] yeah when someone when you are doing
[45:51] because why you are part of the same
[45:54] body
[45:55] are we together
[45:57] to descend the lord's body let's let's
[45:59] let's go to the next question
[46:01] the first one was just to try to
[46:03] illustrate the importance of
[46:05] understanding the body of the lord
[46:07] what the effects are if you are missing
[46:10] it what the implications could be if you
[46:13] work one against the other not even
[46:16] office not even physically physically i
[46:19] can see we have put luck with one
[46:21] another physically i can see we give
[46:23] each other leaves physically i can see
[46:25] we love one another but are we doing
[46:27] that a spiritual realm
[46:29] is that is the agape love that's right
[46:32] that brother spoke about
[46:34] is the acapella
[46:36] meeting together with the philology
[46:41] are they putting pulling that mission
[46:43] together
[46:45] now let's read them
[46:46] let's go to the next point
[46:48] to descend the lord's body it seems to
[46:50] me that you first have to understand the
[46:53] head of the body
[46:55] christ himself his mind
[46:59] to be one with him is it it means to be
[47:01] one with your brother and your sister
[47:04] there is no way you are going to be one
[47:06] with the lord if you don't want to be
[47:08] one with your brother and your sister
[47:10] there's no way and you just say saying
[47:13] it on the shallow
[47:14] that i love you i'm one with you no
[47:18] and when we the lord you know with the
[47:20] lord
[47:21] i love the lord so much because
[47:23] how many of you know that comb that
[47:25] small comb that will come our hair
[47:27] especially us whose hair can get dry so
[47:29] quickly and it's not so so smooth and so
[47:34] blondies like yours
[47:38] sorry i don't mean your blood but i mean
[47:39] your hair is much softer than us we've
[47:41] got a small little
[47:44] if your hair get mixed up sister mike i
[47:46] see yours and we call it an
[47:49] afro hair
[47:51] comb
[47:52] you know it's good life it's like a fork
[47:55] you come to straighten it up so
[47:58] the lord
[47:59] he does not come david with one come and
[48:01] move the difference no one come right
[48:04] that's how the lord calms us yes goes to
[48:06] bed
[48:10] wow what
[48:12] same god
[48:13] all of you that's how the lord teach us
[48:15] yes but we want to treat one another i
[48:18] go to bed
[48:24] and you call yourself a believer
[48:28] the lord doesn't do that
[48:30] if the lord goes soft on him
[48:33] if the lord goes soft on her
[48:35] say that's how the lord died and that's
[48:36] how the lord teach us his children
[48:38] that's why there's no grandfather or
[48:41] grand uncle or uncle's brother there in
[48:44] heaven or nephew and nieces no my
[48:47] daughter in law no there's no those
[48:50] things there there we are brothers and
[48:52] sisters same age amen so we are
[48:55] preparing for that while we are here we
[48:58] are getting in the spirit of the
[49:00] millennium that's what we are doing we
[49:02] are getting ready we are already living
[49:04] out of the seven church ages while we
[49:06] are here
[49:07] the spirit of laodicea is not supposed
[49:09] to be upon us
[49:12] so in the book of philippians he says
[49:15] and i'll focus quickly to the point
[49:18] because i'm watching my time carefully
[49:19] midweek service it shouldn't shouldn't
[49:21] be long
[49:22] should we give you your meal quickly you
[49:25] grab your meal you
[49:28] move so if you hear that i'm
[49:31] i'm everywhere
[49:33] is just imagine a table full of food all
[49:36] sorts of food
[49:37] you just grab what you want
[49:41] don't want to be structural no let's
[49:42] start the starters and finishers and
[49:45] this no no no there's a table spread
[49:48] you grab hallelujah what you need
[49:52] your body the holy spirit yes he's going
[49:54] to guide you you need sausages man
[49:58] and you need lettuce
[50:01] he's gonna do that for you as the word
[50:02] goes forth right yes that's the spirit
[50:05] let's read philippians 2. if there be
[50:07] therefore any
[50:08] consolation in christ if any comfort of
[50:10] love if any fellowship of the spirit of
[50:13] the spirit
[50:15] not much i'm not i'll the fellowship of
[50:17] the spirit of the flesh is very good and
[50:19] that's what we want
[50:21] we must be able to fellowship in the
[50:23] spirit our fellowship in the canal must
[50:26] lead us to the fellowship in the spirit
[50:29] that you intercede
[50:31] that my sister gives the testimony and
[50:33] you just want to jump
[50:37] you feel like the sister speaking to you
[50:40] huh that's how it should be because you
[50:42] are fellowshipping in the spirit you sit
[50:44] here you think of someone in canada and
[50:47] you pray for them
[50:49] amen
[50:51] that is fellowship in the spirit
[50:56] if any bowels of messes fulfill ye my
[50:59] joy that he be like-minded
[51:02] having the same love
[51:04] being
[51:05] of one accord
[51:07] of one mind
[51:09] and that mind is of jesus christ the
[51:11] holy ghost who is inside us he's the
[51:13] leader of this body he's the one we are
[51:15] following the vision let me go down
[51:18] quickly
[51:19] what i want to read is that
[51:21] is um
[51:26] what did i want to read for you
[51:28] okay let nothing be done through strife
[51:30] or vainglory
[51:32] you know what is vainglory
[51:36] but in loneliness of mind let each
[51:38] esteem other better than themselves it's
[51:41] it's not an easy thing
[51:42] it's easy to do it pradeep
[51:45] it's easy i mean it's easy to say it
[51:47] than to do it
[51:49] for for someone to esteem them to esteem
[51:52] someone
[51:53] than themselves
[51:55] we preach it
[51:57] but i tell you what to practice it god
[51:59] must help us
[52:01] to be able to be so humble
[52:03] that we we don't esteem ourselves first
[52:07] we esteem someone my brother more than
[52:11] when when you know you we get in the
[52:13] spirit of that man who saw that there
[52:15] was a
[52:16] a beggar on the street and called and he
[52:18] took his jacket cut it in half
[52:21] amen
[52:22] for real yeah not symbolically for real
[52:25] he cut it in half
[52:27] what did the prophet did what did he do
[52:29] with that man
[52:30] he just wanted to give him his shoes he
[52:33] just felt like you know if my father
[52:34] lived he would have been this age and he
[52:36] said man lord i when i look at him
[52:39] that's my shoes i think if the shoes
[52:40] were the same size brother could have
[52:42] given him the shoes amen
[52:44] but those are things that we do on the
[52:46] physical side think about what the
[52:48] prophet does in the spiritual when he
[52:50] plays on the spiritual realm he really
[52:53] has a burden
[52:55] for that person
[52:56] and we without that bothering my brother
[52:58] my sister no our people will not be
[53:00] restored our children our our relatives
[53:04] how can they be restored because we are
[53:06] not entering into their burden right we
[53:08] are not feeling their pain
[53:10] the devil is destroying them we just
[53:12] pray shallow quick five minutes prayer
[53:15] lord
[53:18] and we finish it
[53:20] but we expect god but once in a while
[53:22] god throws something to show us he
[53:24] restores one of our children and we get
[53:26] motivated and that is something that
[53:28] must take us over the mountain
[53:31] to see liberty you know when they cross
[53:33] the mountain on that day the young
[53:35] people went up the mountain and when
[53:37] they saw the sun coming they said freak
[53:40] that's what we need to do for our
[53:42] brothers and sisters and say my brother
[53:44] you are still down there there is
[53:46] liberty i can see the sun yes we are
[53:49] free from today this is the day of
[53:51] jubilee that's what we should be crying
[53:54] and calling yes for those people when
[53:57] they hear you they say i cannot give up
[53:59] now amen
[54:02] then the lord brings those things to our
[54:03] remembrance i cannot assure you
[54:05] he does it to me
[54:07] and i'm telling you i'm a normal human
[54:08] being
[54:09] just like you are and i think he's doing
[54:11] it to you
[54:12] the lord reminds us but we get so easily
[54:16] distracted
[54:17] and we forget who we are and what our
[54:19] job is supposed to be
[54:22] may god help us
[54:25] in just over half an hour now
[54:27] so don't worry
[54:30] but
[54:31] i just want to drive this home that
[54:33] you know we can not easily forget
[54:38] the message of communion the prophet
[54:39] says
[54:39] [Music]
[54:44] he says
[54:46] the father sent me he said in other
[54:48] words the father sent me and i live by
[54:50] him and every man that comes to christ
[54:52] must live by christ
[54:54] oh my there you are that's communion
[54:58] communion is eating the flesh and
[54:59] drinking the blood of christ himself
[55:02] because you are part of him
[55:04] communion is entering into the tent with
[55:07] isaac
[55:08] that's communion that's not because he
[55:10] paid for you
[55:12] he died and then you now move in with
[55:15] him
[55:16] that's a message for some other time how
[55:18] you move in with isaac and right and the
[55:22] communion that happens in there that's
[55:23] what you and your husband are doing
[55:27] there's a carnality of of thinking when
[55:30] every time we say we are the bride we
[55:31] are intimate with the lord we enter in
[55:34] with the lord the eternal mind thinks
[55:35] about a carnal relationship
[55:38] that's not how it is that's the the
[55:40] wrong way
[55:41] though the heavenly way there was never
[55:43] even supposed to be meeting with a woman
[55:45] and a man in the flesh and we come the
[55:48] way we came
[55:49] no it was supposed to be a word
[55:51] production
[55:52] there was going to be a wet intimacy
[55:54] so we think of meat the enemies so much
[55:57] destroyed this channel mind that every
[55:59] time we think of intimacy and when we
[56:02] say
[56:02] we say we are the host we are the bride
[56:05] of the lord and he's our husband
[56:07] people the devil says what
[56:09] we are
[56:11] but the problem is that the devil thinks
[56:13] here yeah that's right we should we are
[56:15] there we are the bride and we are
[56:17] intimate with our father brother and he
[56:19] said even you know that our affections
[56:22] that's where they should be i believe
[56:24] that we can be so much in the spirit
[56:26] until you know our insight has turned
[56:28] our outside affections completely
[56:32] amen
[56:34] oh my there you are that's the communion
[56:36] that's the real communion that you find
[56:38] when you live by christ
[56:41] that's in the spoken communion well
[56:43] that's my that's that's what many times
[56:45] that we do in the spiritual realm you
[56:48] see each day we've got to co to commune
[56:50] with christ we've got to talk to to him
[56:53] each day
[56:55] each
[57:04] so
[57:05] see each day i die yet leave not not me
[57:09] but christ lives in me so is your soul
[57:12] is your physical body needs so if your
[57:16] physical body needs food each day
[57:18] drink each day to survive your spiritual
[57:21] body needs spiritual food and communion
[57:23] with the lord each day
[57:25] to survive amen to survive
[57:28] meaning the opposite is true also if you
[57:31] don't eat the word and pray and commune
[57:33] with the lord every day you want to
[57:35] survive
[57:36] that's the opposite that i'm saying is
[57:38] the truth and we have you have to make
[57:40] it very clear the devil no
[57:43] amen
[57:45] yes
[57:46] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[57:47] alone but by everywhere that proceedeth
[57:49] out of the mouth of god i want to run
[57:51] quickly and then
[57:52] get to point number three i'll jump some
[57:55] other golden nuggets here that are nice
[57:58] nice nice let me just read this one for
[58:00] you
[58:01] yes he is the word in the beginning was
[58:03] the word and the word was with god and
[58:05] the word was god and the word was made
[58:07] flesh and dwelt among us and we are to
[58:11] eat his body
[58:13] because his body is the weight
[58:16] you see then his body is his weight
[58:19] because he is the weight and when you
[58:22] eat the weight you become the weight
[58:25] a man when you eat sugar too much you
[58:28] become sugar
[58:30] diabetes
[58:31] when you eat you see when you smoke yes
[58:34] everything that you eat you become yeah
[58:37] that's right when you eat the devil you
[58:39] become the devil
[58:41] that's right my word abides with you in
[58:44] you then you can ask what you will and
[58:47] it will be done
[58:48] i'm waiting for a day
[58:50] i always challenge myself i want this
[58:52] happen to happen in my lifetime where we
[58:55] pray for someone who's got cancer and i
[58:58] see that person i say thank you lord
[59:00] amen it's not like i don't trust the
[59:01] lord but i just want to glorify him and
[59:03] say yes lord your word has been
[59:05] fulfilled in my lifetime i want someone
[59:08] in here to pray for a difficult what's
[59:11] so-called difficult and it happens
[59:14] and the lord is doing it every day
[59:16] but you're not realizing some of them
[59:17] are men
[59:18] god help us
[59:20] there you are that's true see what you
[59:22] will
[59:23] it will come to pass let's talk about
[59:24] the relationship with of christ and the
[59:27] bride
[59:28] in you know the relationship of christ
[59:30] and the bride is a direct result or
[59:32] outcome of the price that he paid
[59:35] the price that he paid
[59:37] jesus christ
[59:39] our relationship with him
[59:41] is a direct result of death
[59:43] meaning our relationship with christ is
[59:46] not supposed to reflect anything else
[59:48] it's supposed to reflect and show that
[59:51] he has paid
[59:52] a hefty price
[59:56] we know all the price that he paid we
[59:58] know the cup that he drank you know and
[1:00:01] he said it is finished
[1:00:03] they say when it was he said if it is
[1:00:05] finished there's a greek word that says
[1:00:07] that is
[1:00:08] the tesla thai or something like that
[1:00:11] that isla if i remember well it's it
[1:00:13] means
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:15] it is painting full
[1:00:17] that's what he meant it is finished
[1:00:21] done
[1:00:22] after drinking that cup
[1:00:24] there after paying our dollar
[1:00:29] after he paid that
[1:00:30] painful
[1:00:32] price
[1:00:33] the lord not wanted nothing else god he
[1:00:35] said hey
[1:00:36] to get that bride
[1:00:39] that's the dory
[1:00:40] and he paid it painfully
[1:00:42] for me and you so what should come out
[1:00:44] of that relationship
[1:00:46] huh the greatest prize that he gave us
[1:00:48] was his life himself
[1:00:50] and and you know when you look at your
[1:00:52] husband every day
[1:00:54] if you are a woman
[1:00:55] of course you are all when you look at
[1:00:57] your husband every day you say man
[1:01:00] you are so thankful
[1:01:02] for that man that he could leave all the
[1:01:03] women of the world
[1:01:06] billions and billions of them you could
[1:01:07] have just gone on online and check the
[1:01:09] beautiful ones but he chose you
[1:01:13] when
[1:01:15] not because
[1:01:16] i mean there's so many misuniverses
[1:01:21] so but he chose you because there was
[1:01:23] something in you that spoke to him
[1:01:26] in you he placed a seat before the
[1:01:28] foundation of the world that when he
[1:01:30] went looking for you he said ah see
[1:01:32] she's the one
[1:01:33] this is the one
[1:01:35] the father said are you sure
[1:01:36] lord this is my one i'm going to die for
[1:01:39] that one glory he saw you
[1:01:42] i'm so thankful for my husband amen
[1:01:46] that he chose me
[1:01:48] and he gave gifts he gave love he gave
[1:01:50] patience he gave his sacrifice but the
[1:01:53] biggest one was love i mean was his
[1:01:55] death
[1:01:56] that he had to take it to come and be a
[1:01:58] human being
[1:02:00] you know if one day
[1:02:02] one day
[1:02:04] if a peak
[1:02:05] can just become a human being
[1:02:07] and just sit on your couch as a human
[1:02:09] being and eat the food you eat sleep in
[1:02:12] your electric blanket
[1:02:15] and have a water bottle
[1:02:18] just imagine and wake up and just press
[1:02:20] the microwave the peak yeah
[1:02:23] do you think after two weeks when they
[1:02:24] say hey mister
[1:02:26] now the time for you to become human is
[1:02:28] finished i think
[1:02:29] you need to go back to be a pig
[1:02:32] and sleep there in the stinking what do
[1:02:34] you call it
[1:02:35] sorry stop
[1:02:37] do you think it will agree
[1:02:39] right
[1:02:40] do you think the pig will agree
[1:02:43] no ways
[1:02:44] never not in a million years so no not
[1:02:47] that he he took us from a very
[1:02:51] dirty place and he came to a very dirty
[1:02:54] place he came in that pig stop
[1:02:57] and he walked like this on the mat you
[1:02:59] know a pig stinking
[1:03:01] and he walked in it and then
[1:03:04] he took his bands look for you man
[1:03:08] thinking he never put the mask
[1:03:12] he never put a mask
[1:03:14] then he found you amen
[1:03:18] thank you
[1:03:19] glory
[1:03:21] he took me jesus
[1:03:23] oh thank you after taking me
[1:03:26] then
[1:03:27] he watched me
[1:03:30] wash me
[1:03:32] clean
[1:03:33] sanctify
[1:03:35] and then
[1:03:37] fill me up the spirit
[1:03:39] of the lord amen and now mankind can
[1:03:42] take that
[1:03:43] that thing that was stinking in the
[1:03:44] picture clint
[1:03:46] people now can drink
[1:03:52] that's why people when they meet you
[1:03:54] if they know you before you were
[1:03:56] delivered they said ah is it you
[1:04:00] they don't believe that is you yeah
[1:04:02] people who will meet me now they say aha
[1:04:04] this boy
[1:04:05] he takes a chance
[1:04:08] you say he's preaching
[1:04:10] because he took me they know me when i
[1:04:13] was there
[1:04:14] but now i'm here
[1:04:15] they are just supposed to take me and
[1:04:17] drink the water of life
[1:04:19] and drink using this cup or this vessel
[1:04:22] right that's what you weigh and that's
[1:04:25] what the lord did to us
[1:04:28] romans chapter 5 verse 8-11 but god come
[1:04:32] command commanded his love toward us
[1:04:35] in that while we were sinners
[1:04:37] christ died for us so this is just
[1:04:39] reiterating what i wanted to to say much
[1:04:42] more than being now justified by by his
[1:04:44] blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:04:47] through him for if we were
[1:04:50] if when we were enemies in other words
[1:04:53] we were anti-christ before
[1:04:57] we were then reconciled
[1:04:59] that's why i need to come the
[1:05:00] reconciliation
[1:05:02] the reconciliation now this is where the
[1:05:04] relationship is and that's when when in
[1:05:07] accounting in finance when we say we
[1:05:09] reconcile
[1:05:11] we mean the left the debit side sister
[1:05:13] anna and the credit side they talk
[1:05:15] they're balanced they talk the same
[1:05:17] thing we mean that the bank bank
[1:05:20] reconciliation when we do a
[1:05:21] reconciliation we reconcile the books
[1:05:24] they're balanced
[1:05:25] on the left what do you do on the left
[1:05:28] you do on the right that's what we are
[1:05:30] we are now one with christ we have been
[1:05:32] reconciled which means we are now in a
[1:05:34] relationship
[1:05:37] that's why daily when we leave we were
[1:05:40] reconciled to god by the death of his
[1:05:42] son
[1:05:43] much more being reconciled we shall be
[1:05:46] saved by his life and not only so but we
[1:05:50] also joy in god through our lord jesus
[1:05:53] christ by whom we have now received the
[1:05:56] atonement amen
[1:06:00] in that message i was not disobedient to
[1:06:02] the heavenly vision 1949 july the 18th
[1:06:06] in other words 1949
[1:06:08] two days ago
[1:06:10] father
[1:06:11] we brought again the lord jesus to life
[1:06:14] though all the world seems to be so
[1:06:16] modernistic and they they are going to
[1:06:21] uh
[1:06:22] they are going lord to knowledge instead
[1:06:24] of just a simple faith of god we realize
[1:06:27] that in the garden of eden
[1:06:29] when they test tasted the tree of
[1:06:31] knowledge they broke up the relationship
[1:06:34] with the tree of life
[1:06:36] that's what they did
[1:06:38] so i'm just taking my time that's what
[1:06:40] they did at the garden of eden
[1:06:42] are we together
[1:06:43] they broke the relationship when they
[1:06:46] ate but they were not supposed to
[1:06:49] they broke the relationship by eating
[1:06:51] that tree of knowledge and then they
[1:06:53] they wanted to go further and eat the
[1:06:55] tree of life in that condition
[1:06:58] and god said noise
[1:07:00] let me fix this thing right once and for
[1:07:02] all
[1:07:03] and the only way for him to fix it was
[1:07:05] to calm down himself
[1:07:07] and become a man
[1:07:09] and correct it he's our second adam and
[1:07:12] this adam is never going to fail
[1:07:14] he's not going to fail and his if he's
[1:07:16] not going to fail
[1:07:18] his if is not going to be tricked by the
[1:07:21] subtle devil
[1:07:23] when he says to us today he says to you
[1:07:27] you will not surely die
[1:07:29] you say
[1:07:31] what do you say daniel
[1:07:32] what can you say
[1:07:35] just just shut up
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:37] you must shut him down
[1:07:39] immediately
[1:07:40] don't even give him a moment
[1:07:43] you you're bored with a great price
[1:07:46] if you know who you are you will
[1:07:48] understand that you don't hold
[1:07:49] conversations with the devil
[1:07:52] if you know who you who you what you
[1:07:54] were bored with what you are king
[1:07:57] did
[1:07:58] your husband you know that you don't
[1:08:01] hold conversations with the devil in
[1:08:03] your mind you know that you don't
[1:08:05] entertain him
[1:08:06] a girl who entertains boys on the street
[1:08:09] likelihood of her going down is very
[1:08:11] high
[1:08:13] now we don't entertain it
[1:08:15] evil thoughts
[1:08:17] anything that the devil may want to
[1:08:19] bring to your mind
[1:08:21] it is written shut it down
[1:08:23] that the pastor says
[1:08:24] we hate him and he's this
[1:08:27] in any appearance
[1:08:30] don't don't want to walk no say no no
[1:08:32] i'm still in the camp no no don't walk
[1:08:34] too close to the border
[1:08:37] don't walk too close to the border be
[1:08:39] careful don't walk too close to the
[1:08:40] border
[1:08:41] and sometimes believers walk too close
[1:08:43] to the border of the enemy and armed
[1:08:46] yeah
[1:08:47] imagine
[1:08:49] you're walking close to the border
[1:08:51] you are not armed with the spirit of the
[1:08:53] lord but you are working with a vest on
[1:08:56] the board
[1:08:58] isn't that dangerous yes that's foolish
[1:09:01] for lack of a better weight i'm sorry
[1:09:04] that's not wise
[1:09:05] at least if you were armed
[1:09:07] with two bazoogas
[1:09:09] [Laughter]
[1:09:11] you can now uh walk on the border
[1:09:14] because you know there's some that are
[1:09:15] not armed you are armed you can
[1:09:17] blow the enemy
[1:09:19] but you are not crossing that border you
[1:09:21] are in within the border of your kingdom
[1:09:24] amen you are just making sure that when
[1:09:26] they throw a scat missile you intercept
[1:09:28] it and break it
[1:09:32] hallelujah
[1:09:34] it seems that you and you assume that
[1:09:36] you we need to have the revelation of
[1:09:39] matthew 26 42 and john 19 28 that talks
[1:09:43] about the cup
[1:09:45] that he took
[1:09:47] and i listened to this someone of a
[1:09:49] brother called stephen brinson and then
[1:09:51] he was teaching about you know when when
[1:09:53] when the lord took the cup and you know
[1:09:56] i just so enjoyed that message so much
[1:09:58] the brother taught that message and i
[1:10:00] saw from genesis to revelation that the
[1:10:02] bible is a love story
[1:10:05] everything in here is about love
[1:10:08] of christ and the bride from cover
[1:10:11] to cover amen it is i just saw it it
[1:10:14] just took in my in in my eyes like this
[1:10:16] and i saw from genesis to revelation
[1:10:18] everything is about love
[1:10:20] in here but we can talk about that next
[1:10:22] time but
[1:10:23] here in matthew 26 42 and 19 john 19 28
[1:10:28] he talks about
[1:10:31] the cup
[1:10:33] that he took
[1:10:35] they say in the eastern culture when a
[1:10:38] young man comes to mary he
[1:10:41] he fill a cup with wine and it takes and
[1:10:44] he drinks and he put and he he puts it
[1:10:46] in front of the girl but with the
[1:10:48] parents here
[1:10:50] the moment that girl takes the cup and
[1:10:52] drink also
[1:10:54] dandel
[1:10:55] she agreed
[1:10:56] he is the wife of that man
[1:10:58] and he must go
[1:11:01] back home to his home
[1:11:02] to prepare a house for her
[1:11:05] so that when he come so that where he is
[1:11:08] she can also be
[1:11:10] that's in the eastern culture he did
[1:11:12] that for us he took the cup
[1:11:15] and drank it and bitter cup
[1:11:18] and then he after that
[1:11:20] he said i'm coming
[1:11:22] and i'm coming for you
[1:11:24] have you taken your cup
[1:11:26] have you drank your cup tonight
[1:11:29] have you accepted him
[1:11:32] yes
[1:11:33] yes
[1:11:34] i did
[1:11:35] so if you we we have accepted the cup
[1:11:38] that means that we can drink no other
[1:11:40] cup for anyone
[1:11:42] we are taken our womb is sealed
[1:11:46] closed
[1:11:47] we are sealed
[1:11:48] we can't take anything else no
[1:11:50] shenanigans of the devil whether in by
[1:11:53] means of a thought by means of using my
[1:11:55] brother or my sister's weakness by means
[1:11:57] of using my own weaknesses nothing i'm
[1:12:00] above my own weaknesses
[1:12:02] did you hear that yes sir tonight
[1:12:05] you must live above your own weaknesses
[1:12:10] because they are conquered they don't
[1:12:12] control or rule you anymore your
[1:12:14] weaknesses
[1:12:16] the ones that you were born with
[1:12:18] that we know this brother is a liar
[1:12:21] you live above those your ones because
[1:12:24] they are not yours in the first place
[1:12:26] they were never yours
[1:12:28] it is just the devil who brought and
[1:12:30] attached them to you attached to your
[1:12:32] father run it in the family you know
[1:12:34] they say when you run a cable from there
[1:12:36] today run it through
[1:12:38] in the family
[1:12:39] everyone who's gonna be born in this
[1:12:41] lineage gonna be a thief
[1:12:43] they say don't be surprised his
[1:12:45] great-grandfather was a thief what no
[1:12:48] this one is a bride
[1:12:50] this one is the bride
[1:12:52] that cycle
[1:12:53] a cast
[1:12:55] is cut
[1:12:56] it's destroyed
[1:12:57] and it will never sprout any longer
[1:13:02] thank
[1:13:03] hallelujah now i want to quickly go to
[1:13:06] closing now
[1:13:09] now
[1:13:10] this relationship is so powerful
[1:13:12] brothers and sisters
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:17] when we don't get involved in this
[1:13:19] relationship it's almost like we are
[1:13:21] crucifying him for the second time
[1:13:25] it hurts him so much
[1:13:27] remember
[1:13:28] the vision that the lord showed brother
[1:13:29] branham
[1:13:31] and
[1:13:32] you know every time he does something
[1:13:34] wrong small even
[1:13:36] what he does to the lord jesus christ
[1:13:38] remember that vision yes remember how
[1:13:41] how the prophet explained that how how
[1:13:44] he looked
[1:13:45] how the lord jesus looked and what the
[1:13:48] things that i do
[1:13:49] on earth knowingly
[1:13:51] and he's still deep in on his side and
[1:13:53] he still said i pardoned because he
[1:13:55] loves you so much
[1:13:57] he can't lose when he knows you know no
[1:13:58] better
[1:14:01] the things that i do
[1:14:02] we sing a song here
[1:14:05] oh lord it's all about you father it's
[1:14:06] not about me
[1:14:08] may god help us
[1:14:10] to to know our enemy in his most hidden
[1:14:13] form you know on your computer they say
[1:14:15] there's some hidden files
[1:14:17] things that corrupt the computer and you
[1:14:19] never never find them a hacker called
[1:14:21] the devil has put them there
[1:14:24] you know but the lord
[1:14:26] brings that anti-virus
[1:14:28] yes amen you know called the holy spirit
[1:14:31] it goes through that computer called you
[1:14:33] and it flashes out everything it exposes
[1:14:36] everything
[1:14:37] and be careful
[1:14:39] he can turn around and say and blame you
[1:14:42] that's right he's not there he can turn
[1:14:44] around and say no no no no no
[1:14:47] if that that thing was a virus that came
[1:14:49] from a haircut
[1:14:52] himself
[1:14:53] now he wants to turn around just own it
[1:14:56] i'm sitting now take your bags and you
[1:14:59] are out
[1:15:00] and i want no not even i don't want
[1:15:02] everyone to hear your smell and your
[1:15:04] breath and your footsteps about you
[1:15:08] i want to hear nothing about you this is
[1:15:10] my sister this is my brother this is
[1:15:13] your thought take them and go amen i
[1:15:16] love my sister fully double
[1:15:18] unconditionally
[1:15:19] and my brother and i'm not going to go
[1:15:21] sleep about here
[1:15:22] i'm not gonna think wrong about my
[1:15:24] sister i'm gonna give my brother my
[1:15:26] sister a
[1:15:28] benefit of a doubt
[1:15:30] remember what the pastor said many many
[1:15:32] moons ago
[1:15:34] give your brother a benefit of a doubt
[1:15:36] because you are giving jesus christ in
[1:15:38] him the benefit of
[1:15:40] adult brother isaac the anniversary he
[1:15:42] said one of the principles
[1:15:44] one of the four principles of five was
[1:15:47] don't see david see christ in david
[1:15:52] amen amen
[1:15:55] if you understand and descend the body
[1:15:58] you know
[1:15:59] that
[1:16:00] the way i'm thinking now is wrong
[1:16:04] this thought doesn't cannot be mine
[1:16:08] you must be able to descend that
[1:16:11] know
[1:16:12] your spiritual body
[1:16:13] the way that i'm thinking right now in
[1:16:15] this second the second
[1:16:18] because the devil is able to bring a
[1:16:21] package of thoughts in one second
[1:16:25] he thinks he's clever
[1:16:26] you know but the lord does not even use
[1:16:29] our time to you know he's he's ever
[1:16:31] bright
[1:16:32] his holy ghost when it comes it flashes
[1:16:35] everything that the devil could have
[1:16:36] brought
[1:16:38] so just one given time
[1:16:40] our war is continuous
[1:16:42] our war is ever going in as much as we
[1:16:45] are ever green in the spirit but we
[1:16:47] understand that in this war our war is
[1:16:50] ever
[1:16:51] continuous
[1:16:53] there's no time to to lag when you are
[1:16:55] in the in the front line
[1:16:58] in the front line you know what you're
[1:16:59] exposing you're not only exposing
[1:17:01] yourself
[1:17:03] you're exposing your brother and your
[1:17:04] sister and everybody around you
[1:17:07] you are the step in the body of the lord
[1:17:09] you
[1:17:10] by allowing the devil understand the
[1:17:12] body of the lord how it functions the
[1:17:14] moment you do that and everybody do that
[1:17:16] we know who we are now there was no more
[1:17:18] need time for us to be here we go
[1:17:21] the times of ananias and sapphira will
[1:17:23] come
[1:17:24] and we say hey brother before you come
[1:17:26] in the lord jesus christ has given you
[1:17:28] what you're asking for as you are coming
[1:17:29] through the door you are thinking about
[1:17:31] this and this god gave it to you
[1:17:33] those are the days i'm waiting for
[1:17:37] that's what i want hey my brother come
[1:17:39] here to the office you know yesterday
[1:17:40] you didn't think well about this where
[1:17:42] yesterday when we were in search in such
[1:17:44] a place come let's pray together we pray
[1:17:47] together and it's gone
[1:17:49] that's the time we are waiting for
[1:17:51] that's the time we want
[1:17:53] and we mustn't chicken out we must cry
[1:17:55] for god to give us that because we are
[1:17:57] tired we want to go
[1:17:59] i want to go
[1:18:04] in closing
[1:18:10] yeah including
[1:18:13] the bible says here
[1:18:15] how many are blessed
[1:18:18] and in again in the message
[1:18:21] oh yeah that's the way brother andy
[1:18:23] thank you see he's my partner in crime
[1:18:26] [Laughter]
[1:18:28] amen we are prisoners together
[1:18:31] so
[1:18:32] there he says the prophet christ and his
[1:18:35] church is communion together
[1:18:37] that's the reason we can hear from him
[1:18:40] and see the future before it gets here
[1:18:42] that's what that's what i want
[1:18:44] i want to see the future
[1:18:46] because the lord has given us that
[1:18:47] spirit to see the future we already know
[1:18:49] the future
[1:18:51] we already know it
[1:18:53] before it gets here and can tell the
[1:18:55] future that is perfect
[1:18:58] because that we commune with a god who
[1:19:01] holds eternity in his hands
[1:19:03] communion with one another
[1:19:06] i can't say better sister vanessa i i i
[1:19:09] even say it like a south african will
[1:19:11] speak commuting with one another
[1:19:18] if i'll come from
[1:19:21] you know illinois with one another yeah
[1:19:23] until i don't hear brother ben i said
[1:19:25] sorry brother
[1:19:26] commuting with communing with one
[1:19:28] another
[1:19:32] that's what he says here
[1:19:34] it first started by saying because that
[1:19:36] we commune with god we who holds the
[1:19:39] eternity in his hands listen to the next
[1:19:42] statement
[1:19:44] he says
[1:19:45] communing with one another do you see
[1:19:48] how important that when we commune with
[1:19:50] god
[1:19:51] when we commune we because we are all
[1:19:53] one mystical body yeah
[1:19:56] you can't commune with god and can't
[1:19:58] commune with your brother you can't you
[1:19:59] cannot commune with god and not commune
[1:20:02] with you your brother in the spirit
[1:20:06] communing with one another the body of
[1:20:08] christ the mystical spiritual body of
[1:20:12] christ
[1:20:14] not associated with any kind of an idol
[1:20:17] or a bread or a wine but in the
[1:20:20] spiritual form
[1:20:22] you see
[1:20:24] first john chapter
[1:20:26] four in closing below that let us love
[1:20:29] one another
[1:20:30] for love is of god and everyone that
[1:20:33] loveth is born of god and knoweth god he
[1:20:36] that loveth not
[1:20:38] he that liveth not knoweth not god for
[1:20:41] god is love yes right
[1:20:44] beloved if god so loved us we ought also
[1:20:48] to love one another
[1:20:50] i'm talking a couple here
[1:20:56] and of course filio
[1:20:58] if a man say i love god
[1:21:01] and hated
[1:21:02] his brother and i want us to pause here
[1:21:09] and add i'm not reading the bible i'm
[1:21:11] just i'm preaching if a man say i love
[1:21:15] god
[1:21:16] and despise it his brother yes
[1:21:20] if a man say i love god
[1:21:22] and think bad about his brother
[1:21:26] and not make it right if a man says i
[1:21:28] love god
[1:21:30] and undermine or demean
[1:21:32] or disregard the feelings of his brother
[1:21:36] and he says i love god
[1:21:39] do you understand the body
[1:21:41] do you descend how the body works
[1:21:46] and you just find relevant ways to put
[1:21:49] on your sister that no this is what she
[1:21:52] was meaning yes
[1:21:54] and you don't realize that this is the
[1:21:55] devil
[1:21:56] telling you this no no no no she spoke
[1:21:59] like that i'm not i'm not i'm not it's
[1:22:01] not my way she said it why don't you
[1:22:03] give her the benefit of a doubt
[1:22:06] why don't you find it in you to forgive
[1:22:08] her even before she can see that she's
[1:22:10] wrong
[1:22:10] why why do you want to perpetuate that
[1:22:12] she's full of the devil why what what
[1:22:15] spirit is that one
[1:22:16] but you say you love god
[1:22:18] but god went to the big star yeah and
[1:22:21] talk for you
[1:22:22] and you want to take your sister and
[1:22:24] write it off
[1:22:27] or your brother
[1:22:28] true
[1:22:29] lord jesus
[1:22:31] may god help us
[1:22:34] if a man say i love god
[1:22:38] and hated his brother
[1:22:40] he's a liar
[1:22:41] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:22:44] he had seen
[1:22:45] how can he love god whom he had not even
[1:22:48] seen
[1:22:51] god is love right but god made
[1:22:54] everything
[1:22:55] so everything is based on love the love
[1:22:57] of god
[1:22:59] whatever we think whatever we do
[1:23:01] whatever we desire everything
[1:23:07] and this commandment have we from him
[1:23:09] that he who live at god
[1:23:12] love his brother also
[1:23:14] let us descend the body of the lord this
[1:23:16] is now from the message designing the
[1:23:17] body of the lord let us descend the body
[1:23:19] of the lord descend the times that we
[1:23:21] are living in
[1:23:23] huh
[1:23:24] let's descend the body of the lord
[1:23:26] and descend the times that we are living
[1:23:29] in
[1:23:30] we will die spiritually if we don't do
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:36] and if it is true
[1:23:38] and the holy spirit is with us and we've
[1:23:41] got that last sign of the coming of the
[1:23:43] lord just before he is come
[1:23:45] remember that was just before so don't
[1:23:48] bend
[1:23:49] just a few hours before it bend i
[1:23:52] believe today many
[1:23:55] and i cut it i don't remember what the
[1:23:57] prophet said you can go and read it in
[1:23:59] the spoken word descending the body of
[1:24:01] the lord
[1:24:02] 1959 august the 12th
[1:24:05] or you can ask me to send you the
[1:24:07] powerpoint
[1:24:08] it's very easy
[1:24:10] so
[1:24:11] the point i'm trying to say
[1:24:13] is that time is normal
[1:24:17] it's just a few minutes before
[1:24:20] midnight
[1:24:22] before the cry can come out that ah
[1:24:25] there he is coming i want to see him
[1:24:27] first
[1:24:28] i want to see him coming and and feel
[1:24:30] something change
[1:24:32] and say and say
[1:24:34] i don't even know how far i'll throw my
[1:24:36] shoes
[1:24:36] [Laughter]
[1:24:39] because
[1:24:40] if if you grew the way i grew up you
[1:24:43] know that when your mother was coming
[1:24:45] from town with groceries where she went
[1:24:48] once a month
[1:24:49] to buy groceries you know that when that
[1:24:52] she gets off the taxi maybe a mile away
[1:24:55] and you see her
[1:24:56] the feeling
[1:24:58] my grandmother used to work in pretoria
[1:25:01] in the kitchen
[1:25:02] you know kitchen meaning he was waiting
[1:25:04] for was working for a white man in the
[1:25:07] kitchen
[1:25:08] and cleaning them for them and when she
[1:25:10] came home
[1:25:11] you know what everything stops
[1:25:14] because i know when all these months
[1:25:16] when she was in pretoria she was
[1:25:18] thinking about me
[1:25:19] i i can't wait to see to open the bags
[1:25:22] too and she will bring everything for
[1:25:23] her grandchildren
[1:25:25] you know she'll bring bread that has
[1:25:27] been dried up you know and put jam and
[1:25:29] peanut butter dried up for us
[1:25:32] for us we we weave the ash ups in the
[1:25:34] rural areas and there's peanut butter
[1:25:36] and jam but just that one was brought by
[1:25:38] granny
[1:25:40] the joy
[1:25:42] so when i think of such joys
[1:25:44] and i'm trying to multiply a million
[1:25:46] times the joy that i'm going to feel
[1:25:48] when my body change
