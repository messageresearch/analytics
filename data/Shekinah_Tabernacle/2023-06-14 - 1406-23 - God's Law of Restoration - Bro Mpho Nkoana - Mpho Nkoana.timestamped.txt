[33:27] of you is very special
[33:28] each one of you is very special before
[33:30] God each one of you is unique and God
[33:34] tonight has brought an unworthy human
[33:38] being maybe like myself insignificant
[33:40] just to come and deliver for you
[33:43] something that can maybe change your
[33:45] life for good
[33:47] so that's the whole purpose why we are
[33:49] here tonight that God can deliver unto
[33:51] us something even if it's so small
[33:54] because nothing is smaller when he's in
[33:57] God's hands amen so I'll be standing
[33:59] let's read the scripture but I just
[34:00] wanted you to know that you are very
[34:02] special
[34:03] to God
[34:04] each one of you is very unique and very
[34:07] special and don't underestimate or
[34:09] underage yourself that ah me I'm just by
[34:12] the way no you are very special before
[34:14] God and you will see why as we go along
[34:16] let's read the scripture before we sit
[34:19] down and
[34:21] we will read Joel chapter 1.
[34:25] from verse 1 I mean Joel chapter 2 sorry
[34:32] once we get there please just say
[34:35] amen
[34:37] Joel chapter 2.
[34:39] 124 amen
[34:42] are you there
[34:44] the Bible says blowy the trumpet of Zion
[34:47] and sound and alarm in my Holy Mountain
[34:51] let all the inhabitants of the land
[34:53] tremble for the day of the Lord cometh
[34:56] for it is nigh at hand
[35:01] verse two a day of darkness and glooming
[35:05] gloominess a day of clouds and of thick
[35:07] Darkness as the morning spread upon the
[35:10] mountains
[35:11] a great
[35:12] people and a strong
[35:15] and a strong
[35:17] there hath not been ever the like
[35:20] neither shall be any more after it I
[35:24] wonder if anyone can start to see
[35:26] themselves in this scripture
[35:29] even to The Heirs of many generations
[35:31] there will be no other people like those
[35:33] ones
[35:35] a fire developed before them and behind
[35:38] them a flame Bennett a land the land is
[35:42] at the Garden of Eden before them and
[35:44] behind them a desolate Wilderness yay

[39:42] during that restoration amen with you
[39:45] and and my people shall never be ashamed
[39:48] Hallelujah man today I want us to talk
[39:52] about a simple subject it's not so
[39:54] simple
[39:55] but it's a it's a it's a teaching
[39:57] subject really it cannot be accommodated
[40:00] in this one a service even in prayer
[40:03] meeting it can't he said brother Brandon
[40:05] priesthood I think in two hours this
[40:07] this sermon if I'm not mistaken so we're
[40:09] just going to take the key points or
[40:11] whatever the Lord is leading us to
[40:13] deliver and to to enjoy and to remind
[40:16] each other to motivate and to refresh
[40:18] each other in our hands what we God has
[40:21] in store for you
[40:23] amen do you believe God can change your
[40:25] life tonight amen amen I believe that so
[40:27] let's talk about God's law of
[40:29] restoration
[40:31] God's law of restoration it's been on my
[40:35] heart this subject and I was talking to
[40:38] I was talking together the other time I
[40:40] said man this is moving me because I was
[40:43] thinking about restoration and about
[40:45] Harvest
[40:47] and I I was trying to bring the two
[40:49] subjects together and I realized that
[40:51] you know actually harvest the Harvest
[40:54] what we Harvest is the actual true
[40:56] restoration amen who how many know a
[41:00] harvest
[41:01] do you understand what harvest mean
[41:04] you know Harvest is when we have planted
[41:08] a seed and it has now come to its
[41:11] maturity it has now come to what it was
[41:13] before yeah
[41:17] but that's not our subject today we just
[41:19] want to talk about God
[41:21] 's law of restoration let's let's just
[41:25] read this before we move forward quickly
[41:28] Genesis 20 7-8 this is the story about
[41:31] Abraham when God was telling the king
[41:35] abimele is it abimelech to restore the
[41:39] wife of Abraham the subject of
[41:42] restoration is so powerful and God said
[41:45] now therefore restore the man his wife
[41:50] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[41:53] for thee and thou shalt leave and thou
[41:57] and and if thou restore her not
[42:01] know that thou shalt surely die thou and
[42:06] all that are thine
[42:08] he's asking he's telling this King to go
[42:11] to the prophet and restore restore
[42:14] because he took the wife and this King
[42:17] did not know yeah
[42:19] yeah so the issue here is that what the
[42:21] enemy that we are going to talk about
[42:22] him he knew what he was doing yeah he
[42:26] deceitfully took what didn't belong to
[42:29] him unless King abimelech King abimelech
[42:32] the prophet lies to him but he still had
[42:35] to restore or else die
[42:38] can you see the seriousness of
[42:40] restoration yes
[42:41] therefore amimela grows up early in the
[42:43] morning and called all his servants and
[42:45] told all these things in their eyes in
[42:48] their ears and the men the men were so
[42:51] afraid
[42:52] now
[42:53] for God
[42:55] has a law in his weight
[42:58] the law of God is his word amen
[43:01] look at it this way how can I start this
[43:04] subject just pray for me as we go along
[43:06] amen so I wanted to talk about
[43:09] a subject of being sensitive to the
[43:13] spirit I wanted to talk about it that's
[43:15] the sermon I Was preparing and all of a
[43:17] sudden
[43:19] I don't know what happened I stopped
[43:21] preparing that one yeah that then I came
[43:23] to this subject that was so strong on my
[43:25] heart but I found as I went along that
[43:27] they are actually connected that they
[43:29] are linked but the law of God
[43:32] is actually built in inside his weight
[43:34] God himself his weight is the law and
[43:38] many many times when we think about the
[43:40] law we think about you know and
[43:44] something you know that is going to be
[43:46] pushing you that is going to be that is
[43:48] going to be you you're going to be
[43:50] uncomfortably do whether you like it or
[43:52] not but but there's many different kind
[43:55] of laws are we are we together there is
[43:57] different kind of laws but I want us to
[43:59] go slowly and a little bit and
[44:01] understand the the subject of the law
[44:04] and then you'll be able to see what is
[44:07] this law of restoration
[44:09] because God said I will restore
[44:13] think about the Garden of Eden in the
[44:16] Garden of Eden not the Garden of Eden
[44:18] think about Noah when he was about to
[44:21] take all the animals into the ark what
[44:23] happened there
[44:25] what what happened to those animals that
[44:27] were afraid to human beings that were
[44:29] running around and everything but all of
[44:31] a sudden they started to come together
[44:32] enemies of animals I see a chimpanzee I
[44:36] see a lion I see a Mamba I see I don't
[44:38] know if your mama did your mama go in
[44:41] I see all sorts of animals
[44:44] which are even enemies moving into the
[44:47] ark what kind of atmosphere was there
[44:50] yeah for the animals to move into the
[44:52] ark because it right now we are in that
[44:56] atmosphere where we are moving into
[44:58] Christ and we are being restored
[45:01] to an idiotic condition yes things that
[45:04] are not that are not normal are
[45:06] happening come on things that are
[45:08] actually under according to the flesh
[45:10] not normal yeah they're happening right
[45:12] now people just gather every Wednesday
[45:14] every Sunday they are listening to one
[45:16] person shouting or speaking in front of
[45:18] them is that normal
[45:20] according to the flesh is not
[45:22] people just come and then they say they
[45:25] start to sing things that are happening
[45:27] you know are happening that are not
[45:29] normal yeah yeah and that's abnormal it
[45:31] is because the law of restoration is
[45:34] taking place as we speak God is busy
[45:37] restoring because he said in the Garden
[45:39] of Eden I'm going to restore
[45:42] listen
[45:44] now for God has a law and his weight is
[45:47] law
[45:48] I I just enjoyed putting that one in
[45:51] bold
[45:52] and everything is surrounded by some
[45:55] kind of law
[45:56] think about it
[45:57] the plans
[45:59] think about the plants when a plant
[46:01] grows you plant a seed of a pumpkin
[46:05] it cannot help it but as long as it gets
[46:09] under the right atmosphere yeah yeah and
[46:11] it starts to grow it is because of the
[46:14] law that God has put in the seed the law
[46:17] of life and the law of growing and the
[46:19] law of germinating and it Bears fruits
[46:22] and those fruits they become and have
[46:24] seeds that is similar to the one that
[46:26] was planted because it is the law of God
[46:29] that he has put
[46:30] now Allah is something very striking
[46:32] there is a law there is a law of of
[46:36] gravity yes
[46:37] yes there is a lot of physics
[46:40] there is a law of human you know a human
[46:42] body how it grows there's a certain
[46:44] pattern and law that God prescribed if
[46:47] now you just you know you know something
[46:49] just happened my body knows how to
[46:52] respond because of the law of God they
[46:54] see just keep giving waves and giving
[46:56] ways all we know we don't know from when
[46:59] because God has set up a law in his word
[47:02] so it has to follow that pattern of the
[47:04] law of God Amen so now now if we if we
[47:07] read carefully
[47:08] and we're going to jump there now if we
[47:11] we just try to understand what is what
[47:13] is this restore what is the meaning of
[47:16] the word restore now men of God says
[47:19] that to restore it means to return to
[47:22] the former owner
[47:23] or to bring back to the former estate of
[47:26] condition
[47:28] and we can enforce a claim to be
[47:32] restored so so when when you take
[47:35] something
[47:36] back to the original owner but it's not
[47:39] a copy no no you take something that
[47:42] belongs to Sister Rebecca that you Stone
[47:45] and now you are giving it back to her in
[47:48] its condition it is being restored to
[47:51] his original owner so you and me are
[47:54] actually at the moment in that process
[47:56] where we are going back to where we used
[47:58] to be yeah we are being restored at the
[48:00] Garden because at the Garden of Eden
[48:02] things were messed up Adam took up
[48:05] everything and sort of tried to destroy
[48:08] the plan of God how God wanted things to
[48:10] be but God said okay go be in the world
[48:13] but I am going to restore
[48:16] and that's where we are going right now
[48:18] so this thing of restoration listen to
[48:21] the man of God there he says now that's
[48:23] what the Webster says the way to restore
[48:26] means to bring back to the Homer owner
[48:28] to bring back to a former State
[48:30] condition to restore means to bring back
[48:34] is to restore a claim can be enforced
[48:37] now to bring anything back to his
[48:39] rightful owner where it belongs
[48:42] therefore some way therefore some way it
[48:45] went away rightful owner can wander
[48:48] around
[48:49] anyway but to restore is to bring back
[48:52] in to it who really owns it
[48:56] your eternal life has been
[48:59] somehow deceitfully robbed
[49:02] almost taken away from us God said never
[49:05] I cannot allow this I have a plan of
[49:09] restoration and there is a law in the
[49:12] word of God that whatever God says must
[49:15] happen that is another law there's no
[49:18] way in which God's word cannot be
[49:19] fulfilled so listen to this
[49:22] and in order to do this we have a right
[49:25] to enforce if there is a law to enforce
[49:28] this rightful condition of restoration
[49:29] to restore I just I just don't know how
[49:32] to explain it but the law is like this
[49:34] there is a law of Life yeah how life
[49:37] comes how Life Starts there is a law you
[49:41] know of Grace who who knows the law of
[49:43] Grace
[49:44] so
[49:46] there is a law of love love there's love
[49:49] built inside the lamb there is there is
[49:52] a lot of redemption yes you know there
[49:55] is a law of anything you can think of
[49:57] yes even here on Earth they are trying
[49:59] to replicate the law but they can't it's
[50:02] not Eternal that law you that's why when
[50:05] you you do you what do you do you do
[50:07] something against the law you get
[50:09] punished you do this and this because
[50:10] that law is not perfect but the law of
[50:13] God for example the law of love
[50:16] how does the law of love work
[50:19] the law of love was in such a way that
[50:22] we will say is abnormal how can you love
[50:26] someone who don't love you yeah come on
[50:28] the true love of God you love you
[50:32] forgive someone unconditionally even
[50:34] before they ask you you forgive them
[50:36] that that's the law of love the true
[50:39] love of God so there is build lock the
[50:41] beds when they fly there is a law built
[50:44] in the bed that makes it to be able to
[50:47] fly me and you you can try but you just
[50:49] fall down but there is a law built
[50:51] inside a bed to fly a fish has got a law
[50:55] built in it to be able to swim yeah
[50:59] hallelujah how many believe this yeah
[51:02] yeah now now let's let's look at the law
[51:06] now
[51:07] let's say we have the law and then that
[51:10] law is not being implemented it's not
[51:12] taking place
[51:14] oh no one obeys it no one applies it
[51:18] nothing happens what is the use of that
[51:20] law right
[51:22] why do we have the law of Grace when no
[51:26] one is going to make sure that I have
[51:27] Grace
[51:29] what is the use of a law a speed limit
[51:31] here on this road if everybody is going
[51:34] to drive the way they want
[51:36] this is the use
[51:37] a law is there to be implemented
[51:45] to be enforced when I'm saying enforce
[51:47] don't think of violent right no no I you
[51:50] can force something using love yeah
[51:54] I are you are you are you following me
[51:57] the Believers
[51:58] okay let's let's read this let's read
[52:00] the next slide we'll be together by end
[52:02] of the end of the night amen
[52:04] enforcement of the law
[52:06] the law will be of no benefit if
[52:12] and use of it if it's not applied and
[52:15] enforced
[52:16] that's my statement there there will be
[52:19] no no results no fruits Satan will get
[52:21] away with anything he wants because he
[52:24] is the first one to disobey God Satan is
[52:26] not just going to obey the law of God
[52:28] he's not something has to enforce him do
[52:33] you think all these people all of them
[52:34] are a law abiding citizens there must be
[52:38] a policeman to enforce their law
[52:42] and if the policeman cannot see an
[52:44] offender somebody has to report
[52:47] otherwise you are colluding with the
[52:50] criminal
[52:51] if you see someone doing crime you do
[52:54] what you report
[52:56] if you don't report it can be
[52:58] interpreted as a collusion why don't you
[53:01] report it yeah because you see something
[53:03] someone is doing something is harming
[53:05] somebody you just go and live it
[53:08] ah you are afraid of the criminal or are
[53:11] you I you don't have the trust and the
[53:13] confidence in the law those things do
[53:15] exist but let's bring it to the
[53:17] spiritual part
[53:18] who is our enforcer we've got a
[53:21] policeman called the Holy Spirit and we
[53:23] must inform him oh yes to and to be he's
[53:26] the only one who's going to put Satan
[53:29] inside the cell and put the what do you
[53:33] call those things
[53:34] handcuffs and enforce the law of God
[53:38] unfaited yes he's the only one
[53:41] now I don't hear that and sometimes
[53:44] people don't report wrong things
[53:46] to the police
[53:47] for some other reasons some people maybe
[53:50] they didn't know
[53:51] some people may be they were ignorant
[53:53] some people maybe they they is their
[53:56] friend
[53:57] so so there's many many reasons why
[53:59] people don't report but hey you can also
[54:04] not report because you're actually
[54:05] supporting
[54:08] do we want to be found on the side where
[54:10] we are supporting Satan that means we
[54:12] are supposed to be reporting him on a
[54:14] daily basis otherwise look you are a
[54:17] Believer whether you like it or not you
[54:19] have been chosen by God ah it's not up
[54:23] to you God chose you and God found you
[54:26] when you did not look for him now
[54:29] therefore you you are stuck with Jesus
[54:32] and therefore you have everything that
[54:35] God said you have to apply it according
[54:38] to him otherwise if he turns out that
[54:40] you are not it simply just proves the
[54:42] opposite
[54:43] that maybe you are not his after all
[54:46] otherwise why should God's word fail
[54:50] God's word will never fail and if I am
[54:53] going to be a
[54:55] an object that is going to make God's
[54:57] word not able to be fulfilled ah there
[55:01] could be a suggestion there
[55:03] maybe this one is not the son of God
[55:07] so every Son of God has to go according
[55:11] to the law of God and there are laws
[55:14] that are rigid that you know like thou
[55:16] shall not and as I'm lost that you know
[55:19] this the law of the spirit of God that
[55:21] guides you
[55:22] the law that will teach you every step
[55:25] of the way the law of love the law of
[55:27] forgiveness all those things that built
[55:30] inside God's word which is the ultimate
[55:31] law amen
[55:33] so we cannot be found colluding with
[55:37] this Criminal
[55:39] you know the criminal
[55:41] and our crime can be not to report him
[55:44] how many understand the meaning of the
[55:46] word iniquity
[55:48] yeah amen
[55:51] I don't if you find that
[55:53] I'm too hot maybe just
[55:56] forgive me and don't take it up with me
[56:00] take it up with the Lord because it's
[56:02] not me I I'm just trying to to transfer
[56:05] or to give you what what the lord gave
[56:08] me but if you may find that maybe that
[56:10] something is too hard to swallow don't
[56:13] take it up with me me I'm just your
[56:14] brother yeah I'm just your brother take
[56:17] it up with the Lord just like if you get
[56:20] blessed you're going to go to the Lord
[56:21] and thank him isn't it and praise him
[56:23] and say father I thank you I appreciate
[56:26] you father so if something comes and you
[56:28] don't like it take it up with him not me
[56:31] what can I do
[56:34] like it's just only going to allow that
[56:37] criminal to cause a frackers between me
[56:39] and you I'm
[56:40] a ninja
[56:43] you prayed when you came to church
[56:45] did you
[56:46] did you pray for the minister and you
[56:49] say Lord come and speak to me tonight
[56:52] so if anything comes here and you go
[56:54] away home and you're not blessed whose
[56:56] fault is it mine or yours
[57:01] I don't mean to be that way but what I'm
[57:04] trying to say is
[57:06] the footsteps of the righteous are
[57:08] ordered of the Lord surely you must pick
[57:10] up something from what we read here from
[57:12] what we prayed for what we've left
[57:14] everything and came here to church
[57:16] something home
[57:19] that will who can remember forget about
[57:21] forget about the neighbor I wanted to
[57:24] tell you at the beginning of the service
[57:25] that okay I wish I had a button you know
[57:28] where I can press and reset you
[57:30] all of you and just reset you clear away
[57:33] forget about the day and what happened
[57:34] everything I just I just wanted to press
[57:37] that button just to clear everything
[57:39] that happened during the day and we
[57:41] reset and start and then from there I
[57:43] give you the cubicles each one in their
[57:45] cubicles so that it says you and the
[57:47] Lord
[57:48] so that when you say Amen is that you
[57:52] and the Lord they are not looking at
[57:54] who's next door who is saying what who
[57:56] is thinking what and what have you
[57:57] you've just been reseted clear oh my
[58:01] clean Road I'm starting a new page
[58:03] that's the service that's attitude we
[58:05] come to church to come and hear God on a
[58:08] clear heart and a clear mind and say
[58:11] speak to me my Lord
[58:12] so let's hear the next slide
[58:16] we said the officer is the holy spirit
[58:18] right tonight I'm trying to just teach
[58:22] or just go slowly
[58:24] not be jumping around
[58:27] the officer was going to
[58:29] going to take the fellow that stole your
[58:32] property was going to take him court and
[58:35] you keep pulling him back
[58:38] well I don't know just whether you
[58:41] should do this or not he will never get
[58:43] him there just let him go
[58:47] what the prophet is saying here is that
[58:49] do not hinder the Holy Spirit from
[58:51] dealing with the Devil right tell the
[58:53] Holy Spirit you know that song that says
[58:55] I must tell Jesus
[58:58] I must tell Jesus you know it you don't
[59:02] know I'll teach you after this yes so
[59:05] take Jesus everything go to him talk to
[59:08] them and force them you cannot do
[59:11] anything yourself there is a person
[59:14] specifically appointed oh yes to deal
[59:18] with the Enemy
[59:20] you are not supposed to deal with the
[59:22] Enemy whether that enemy comes in
[59:23] whatever form of shape whether through
[59:25] your brother you see him and you see ah
[59:28] no no don't deal with it give it to the
[59:31] agent there's a police officer
[59:34] talk to him give it to him then you'll
[59:37] see how he's going to handle yeah
[59:39] that's what the man of God is trying to
[59:41] say here he says that that way you do
[59:43] let's let Satan just get away all the
[59:47] doubts and everything flee from mind
[59:48] then God will raise up you raise you up
[59:52] good
[59:52] he will restore everything that death
[59:54] killed that's right now the only way it
[59:57] can never remain dead let it lay in the
[1:00:00] wrong place so this is the problem
[1:00:03] the only way in which we are not going
[1:00:06] to be able to be restored is if we don't
[1:00:09] get into the right place
[1:00:11] staying in the weight staying remaining
[1:00:13] in the world remaining in the spirit at
[1:00:16] all times that's the thing that is going
[1:00:18] to make us to be fully restored by
[1:00:21] remaining in the spirit of the Lord at
[1:00:24] all times
[1:00:26] are you hearing me Believers that's the
[1:00:28] only thing that the moment we get out of
[1:00:30] our position and we find ourselves
[1:00:33] colluding with the Devil colluding with
[1:00:36] Satan by not reporting I like what
[1:00:38] brother and he said
[1:00:39] the ultimatum that he gave the devil I
[1:00:42] thought you when he said you know you
[1:00:45] know devil and I went and watched that
[1:00:47] testimony again he said he said you know
[1:00:49] I said Satan you know if you if you
[1:00:52] bring this thing again I thought my I
[1:00:54] wonder what the end he's going to say oh
[1:00:56] boy I thought he was going to say I'm
[1:00:57] gonna kick you
[1:01:00] say I'm gonna I'm gonna pray to everyone
[1:01:03] I said wow
[1:01:05] how many of you said wow
[1:01:08] is it the law of God is we don't fight
[1:01:11] the way the world fights amen
[1:01:13] When you pray actually you are bombing
[1:01:15] the compound of Satan when you bring the
[1:01:19] word of God to Satan you're actually
[1:01:20] blasting him off it's not just a prayer
[1:01:23] when you pray when you think where good
[1:01:26] thoughts about your brother you're
[1:01:27] blasting the devil yes when you do
[1:01:30] things that the devil don't want you to
[1:01:32] do that are in line with the you are
[1:01:33] actually destroying that because you are
[1:01:35] giving them no grip you are not giving
[1:01:37] the enemy anything to hold on the moment
[1:01:40] you find it physically you are not
[1:01:41] allowing the Holy Spirit allow the
[1:01:43] spirit yes to deal with Satan you just
[1:01:47] get in line
[1:01:48] I said oh this brother is going to say
[1:01:50] devil if you're going to do this again
[1:01:53] and I feel this Spirit coming you know
[1:01:55] what I'm gonna do David I said my I
[1:01:58] wonder what he said I'm gonna start from
[1:02:00] the from the up north
[1:02:02] and I'll finish I said ah this is how I
[1:02:06] fight my battle yes this is how I fight
[1:02:09] my battle so
[1:02:11] that is how we fight our battles yes
[1:02:14] what the brother mentioned here was that
[1:02:16] he was saying okay now I'm going to to
[1:02:19] take you personally to the police
[1:02:22] men
[1:02:23] who is going to deal with you and
[1:02:25] brother Brandon I remember when he was
[1:02:28] praying for the people just praying
[1:02:31] the player will cast The Devils until he
[1:02:35] will see and he will feel and he will
[1:02:37] see some of them in the shape of a
[1:02:39] tortoise or a bed yeah
[1:02:42] yeah getting excited and overwhelmed
[1:02:44] just from him praying
[1:02:49] just praying praying a faithful prayer
[1:02:52] it was burning the devil it was hitting
[1:02:56] them it was blasting them yeah it was
[1:02:58] bombing them
[1:03:00] and they were calling each other to come
[1:03:01] and help each other it's just the man of
[1:03:03] God I pray just your simple prayer of
[1:03:06] faith amen amen just your simple
[1:03:08] blessing of your sister and your brother
[1:03:10] right right huh
[1:03:15] help us Lord
[1:03:18] enforce
[1:03:20] then
[1:03:21] we are the the we we have a privilege to
[1:03:25] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:03:28] gave us
[1:03:30] right
[1:03:31] for what does he say there
[1:03:35] for God has a law and his law his word
[1:03:39] is a law and a God is in God in this
[1:03:43] word made certain claims to the church
[1:03:46] therefore we have the right to force the
[1:03:50] claims upon Satan yes
[1:03:52] that's right
[1:03:53] to say give it back come on
[1:03:56] and he has to do it yes because that is
[1:03:59] God's word and the God said it you
[1:04:02] didn't say it sister number did you I
[1:04:04] didn't say it's God God said it and then
[1:04:07] it's like the law the policeman comes to
[1:04:10] you and say hey brother you are speeding
[1:04:14] this is your speed limit you can't tell
[1:04:17] him that no no no no no no no no he's
[1:04:19] got the law he said hey I have got the
[1:04:21] law he says if you are driving this pit
[1:04:25] in this road I'm supposed to arrest you
[1:04:28] or give you a ticket I want to enforce
[1:04:31] the law on you I can see you're a doctor
[1:04:33] I can see you are in a pastor I can see
[1:04:36] you are an up man I can see you are
[1:04:38] rushing
[1:04:40] I understand but there is a law right
[1:04:43] right I'm I've been forcing the law on
[1:04:45] you right give me your lessons
[1:04:47] he's enforcing the law he can be a young
[1:04:49] man and maybe you're an elder you say
[1:04:52] this boy is disrespectful no he's not
[1:04:54] disrespectful
[1:04:55] he is enforcing the law and that's what
[1:04:58] me and you we may be a small little boy
[1:05:00] to the devil but we've got the law of
[1:05:03] God which is his way and we must enforce
[1:05:06] it yes
[1:05:09] yes
[1:05:11] preach it listen to this
[1:05:15] we use a different type of a law you
[1:05:17] cannot apply and enforce God's law
[1:05:20] without the spirit
[1:05:22] of God
[1:05:24] so because we We Are Spiritual Beings
[1:05:28] we apply the with the spirit of God is
[1:05:31] the one that is leading us apply this
[1:05:34] law
[1:05:34] in other words I'm not going to come to
[1:05:37] you remember Paul said hey be careful
[1:05:39] the letter killeth
[1:05:40] you know the letter
[1:05:42] I can say oh no brother okay can I use
[1:05:46] the example brother Ben
[1:05:47] the pastor was here telling us about the
[1:05:50] church order
[1:05:52] how many beliefs in church order Church
[1:05:54] order
[1:05:56] and then just order it means that we
[1:05:58] must respect the sanctuary the spirit
[1:06:01] being holy spirit is here
[1:06:04] now
[1:06:05] he does not mean that you must it's not
[1:06:08] it's not just a letter that we must not
[1:06:10] talk yet no no is understanding the
[1:06:13] spiritual part that there is a presence
[1:06:15] of God in the sanctuary this place we
[1:06:18] dedicated it to serve God therefore if
[1:06:23] someone some people got delivered even
[1:06:25] after service that's why we must come
[1:06:27] here 30 minutes before and praying
[1:06:31] when we leave we live respectfully not
[1:06:34] is nothing to do with the building it's
[1:06:36] nothing to do with the chairs it's the
[1:06:38] sanctuary of God there is a certain
[1:06:40] order that the spirit wants yeah but we
[1:06:44] are so guilty me included amen and we
[1:06:47] forget like the children of Israel did
[1:06:49] they forgot and they were reminded with
[1:06:52] a
[1:06:53] spanking we don't want the spanking of
[1:06:55] God so we want to understand the
[1:06:59] physical and the spiritual implication
[1:07:01] of our actions of our thoughts and our
[1:07:05] doings because
[1:07:07] he said somewhere the holy spirit is so
[1:07:09] sensitive yeah
[1:07:11] but even a little child running here
[1:07:13] he can just move
[1:07:16] when the atmosphere is right he comes
[1:07:18] back
[1:07:20] so we have to understand that but the
[1:07:23] key is this we must do it physically and
[1:07:27] it's not a physical job I don't know how
[1:07:29] to explain it better I'll leave it to
[1:07:31] Brother Bear but I thought I can give
[1:07:33] that example it don't it's not just we
[1:07:36] we must respect the presence of the
[1:07:38] Living God when we come in the church
[1:07:40] when you come in the century it's more
[1:07:42] about the house of God this is the house
[1:07:45] of God the people of God the presence of
[1:07:48] God everything about him if we do that
[1:07:52] the spirit of God will come down and he
[1:07:55] will enforce
[1:07:56] the promises that God has given to us
[1:07:59] and who will see things that we never
[1:08:01] expected to see here because we are
[1:08:04] simply aligning yeah just by simply a
[1:08:07] woman listening to the husband or by
[1:08:09] simply you listening to Jesus Christ
[1:08:11] here
[1:08:12] can make miracles
[1:08:14] just came in the house
[1:08:16] and the children were crying and
[1:08:18] everything was out of order
[1:08:20] he didn't say hey what is this this this
[1:08:21] this this this no no he starts talking
[1:08:24] apron and started to wash the dishes
[1:08:26] mm-hmm
[1:08:27] and that changed the atmosphere because
[1:08:29] he brought the atmos he he used the
[1:08:31] right channel to enforce
[1:08:36] false I don't know how to say it sister
[1:08:38] Naomi the Lord help me am I saying it
[1:08:41] right thank you
[1:08:42] so the law of the land is to enforce if
[1:08:46] someone takes your property you go to
[1:08:48] court they enforce and you get it back
[1:08:51] that's the law right but the law of God
[1:08:54] the law of the spirit of God is to force
[1:08:56] Satan I want to reiterate this point
[1:08:59] Satan must be enforced amen
[1:09:04] to give up that which here he
[1:09:06] unrightfully deceitfully taken from God
[1:09:10] Souls of man he took from God Souls of
[1:09:13] women children sickness of the body he
[1:09:16] plays upon people where God Made Them In
[1:09:19] His Image to be like him and the church
[1:09:22] is given the rightful legal rights by
[1:09:25] the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:28] and force upon him Satan that's what we
[1:09:31] must do yes and we must believe and
[1:09:34] enforce it oh yes the way he said it
[1:09:36] sorry
[1:09:38] now one day
[1:09:41] we've got an event in this family in
[1:09:44] this church right we've got a family of
[1:09:45] the events they are not here now
[1:09:47] you know their car was stolen remember
[1:09:50] and that brings me to another family of
[1:09:52] the events also during Brothers time it
[1:09:54] was also the events family their car was
[1:09:57] stolen as well
[1:09:58] the evidence family here their cow was
[1:10:00] also stolen a few years ago remember
[1:10:03] so the Indian family they share the car
[1:10:05] was stolen
[1:10:09] and at the same
[1:10:11] go today and forever yeah yeah he did
[1:10:13] what he did during Brothers time and the
[1:10:16] events family here their cow was
[1:10:17] restored
[1:10:18] is it when you when you enforce
[1:10:22] God's law he restores yeah so brother
[1:10:26] here was just telling about the story
[1:10:28] about you know how the thieves stole the
[1:10:30] car of this man and and then the clothes
[1:10:34] and everything were in there and this
[1:10:36] man drove so long to come to church
[1:10:38] the clothes for his wife and the
[1:10:40] children are in the car and the prophet
[1:10:42] prayed and the brothers five of them
[1:10:43] knelt and prayed
[1:10:45] that's the thing
[1:10:47] now another more circumstances or let me
[1:10:50] say under this abnormal circumstances
[1:10:51] we're supposed to go to the police and
[1:10:54] chase them and find them and put the car
[1:10:55] insurance in the car and the tracker and
[1:10:58] everything and when we find those
[1:10:59] thieves we must hit them right
[1:11:01] and I ask them
[1:11:03] the men of God prayed in state that's
[1:11:06] how the law Works in our family
[1:11:09] we the lowest it was not the police who
[1:11:12] found the car no no that the Holy Spirit
[1:11:14] he the real police convicted that man
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:19] and that man had to come back and pack
[1:11:22] the car there yeah the police of this
[1:11:24] world did not arrest him right I didn't
[1:11:26] hear any report he left
[1:11:29] he
[1:11:31] why didn't the Holy Spirit make them to
[1:11:33] arrest him
[1:11:34] no that's not how we work right our
[1:11:37] police officer restores and that's all
[1:11:40] who can who can tell what that meant
[1:11:42] what went on in his life
[1:11:44] what what happened you you spend so much
[1:11:47] time and I put petal and steal a car and
[1:11:50] go all of a sudden you want to come back
[1:11:52] I don't see many of them brothers
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:55] I don't see many of those incidences
[1:11:58] I can see him he's swearing like this
[1:12:00] like this like this like this and he's
[1:12:02] turning back five brothers including the
[1:12:04] prophet they nailed and they pray and
[1:12:06] the prophet said I I enforced the law of
[1:12:09] God I enforced it and the death you have
[1:12:11] to come to a point where you want to do
[1:12:14] it
[1:12:16] otherwise
[1:12:18] imagine
[1:12:19] the police officer does not want to do
[1:12:22] his job
[1:12:26] oh yeah let's talk about the law of love
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:30] this is another unusual one to the flesh
[1:12:34] to say that I must love my enemy oh yeah
[1:12:38] and not only that
[1:12:39] I must love my enemy the way I love
[1:12:43] myself
[1:12:44] or my neighbor sorry amen
[1:12:48] even my enemy yeah that person that if
[1:12:52] if given an opportunity
[1:12:54] can just poison you
[1:12:56] and kill you that one is the one you
[1:12:59] must give a class of what and love you
[1:13:01] yeah that's not according to the law of
[1:13:04] the flesh
[1:13:05] that is very an unrealistic unusual
[1:13:08] right so the Bible says that you know I
[1:13:11] said that in the title The Law of love
[1:13:14] I know it comes from the Ten
[1:13:15] Commandments but you know it is actually
[1:13:18] the true love
[1:13:20] of my neighbor
[1:13:22] is not even based on thou shall do it
[1:13:26] no it's the spirit of God moving in me
[1:13:29] that I love my brother my sister and my
[1:13:33] neighbor and I love them the way I love
[1:13:35] myself that is deep
[1:13:38] to love someone the way you love
[1:13:39] yourself
[1:13:41] if you pause and think about it
[1:13:43] unless you don't love yourself enough
[1:13:46] but the way you love yourself
[1:13:48] you must love the next person
[1:13:51] isn't it and I think it's awesome to be
[1:13:55] able to be challenged by the spirit of
[1:13:58] God to love
[1:14:00] forget about us here as as we don't even
[1:14:03] ask you you must love us
[1:14:05] the neighbor
[1:14:07] who is an unbeliever right
[1:14:09] me I don't even think of myself
[1:14:12] I'll just pray for you if I see a bit of
[1:14:14] a little bit of a lovely but me I must
[1:14:17] love you whether I like it or not
[1:14:23] it's very important I loved you and I
[1:14:26] chose you and I took you from a childish
[1:14:30] stupid sinful world
[1:14:32] I was very naughty one day I'll tell you
[1:14:35] and he pulled me I know don't Glory so
[1:14:39] who am I
[1:14:41] to pick and choose God's children amen
[1:14:45] amen hey I cannot give this one a
[1:14:48] present like this and then tomorrow's ah
[1:14:50] sister Maggie oh sorry I just give it a
[1:14:52] small little present yeah huh based on
[1:14:55] what
[1:14:56] I must love them
[1:14:58] I must be adding more more what we call
[1:15:01] it
[1:15:03] those those of love
[1:15:05] for all of them equally I must do that
[1:15:08] that's the law of love
[1:15:10] so a neighbor must see that love someone
[1:15:13] driving with me on the road must fill my
[1:15:15] love driving there
[1:15:19] amen he mustn't feel attention that ah
[1:15:22] this guy was just stopping and just
[1:15:24] kicking and swearing me at me because
[1:15:25] there's a road rage or or you know the
[1:15:28] spirit is here on this on the on the
[1:15:29] road you know that yeah so oh yeah and
[1:15:32] and people
[1:15:33] you can almost feel those those Spirits
[1:15:35] yes you can you can see you can if you
[1:15:38] are sensitive to the spiritual Spirits
[1:15:39] you can sense
[1:15:42] yeah on the road yes
[1:15:44] yes you must be able
[1:15:46] to that
[1:15:47] at the same time people must be able to
[1:15:49] sense
[1:15:51] that's not the usual driver
[1:15:54] that one
[1:15:56] huh
[1:15:57] may God help us
[1:15:59] me included
[1:16:02] now
[1:16:05] we have the law
[1:16:08] of life in US
[1:16:11] it's given to us we don't only thing you
[1:16:14] have to do you are made and born and
[1:16:16] placed here in the body of Christ as
[1:16:18] Sons and Daughters of God you don't have
[1:16:20] to knock down the devil we've got the
[1:16:23] law
[1:16:25] but that's the law of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:27] the law the only thing you know have to
[1:16:32] do is to know how you let go and let God
[1:16:37] that's what I was trying to say earlier
[1:16:39] to be in the right position to to stand
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:43] make sure you're standing right
[1:16:45] one day my house bent
[1:16:48] and a brother calls me
[1:16:50] from Over the borders
[1:16:53] and he says to me brother
[1:16:55] I'm sorry about your house
[1:16:58] and and he says so many things and then
[1:17:00] what he what stood for me he said to me
[1:17:02] brother
[1:17:03] I wanna ask you something
[1:17:05] you know
[1:17:07] stand before the Lord
[1:17:10] stand
[1:17:11] you are sure everything is fine you
[1:17:13] check your life and everything I say yes
[1:17:15] my brother he said stand
[1:17:17] amen and watch God
[1:17:19] amen so to stand to stand before God is
[1:17:23] to say God
[1:17:25] I've everything I can do but here I
[1:17:28] stand all right before you yeah my heart
[1:17:31] my life my family my everything is open
[1:17:35] before you you know it Lord stand
[1:17:39] and see the hand of the Lord amen that's
[1:17:41] what the prophet says if we just stand
[1:17:46] and know how to let go
[1:17:51] it's not easy to let go nowadays yeah
[1:17:54] but there is a man
[1:17:56] who's called
[1:17:58] an agent of God
[1:18:00] he can remove things that are difficult
[1:18:03] for you he can enforce Satan he can he's
[1:18:08] the only one who is able to erase memory
[1:18:12] yeah he's the only one who is able to
[1:18:15] remove head and bitterness yeah
[1:18:20] time a root of bitterness arises among
[1:18:23] people you find that it's because we
[1:18:26] opened up again yeah it's true and the
[1:18:29] root of bitterness come so we must be
[1:18:31] able to see it in a sense sense it
[1:18:34] our love must be so strong
[1:18:37] that an unbeliever must want to want to
[1:18:40] be with us
[1:18:43] Hallelujah
[1:18:46] That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the
[1:18:48] only thing you can you know he have to
[1:18:51] do is to know how to let go and let God
[1:18:54] you keep fighting at it see
[1:18:58] and I want never work
[1:19:01] when you let go and let go that's all
[1:19:04] see

[1:23:13] house like this like this like this
[1:23:15] that's what Holy Spirit work the Holy
[1:23:17] Spirit does not want us to be vague be

[1:24:17] tell me about her her weaknesses give my
[1:24:21] daughter according to my weight
[1:24:25] otherwise the unbelievers will appear to
[1:24:28] be above us
[1:24:30] last scripture for you then we pray
[1:24:34] Romans chapter 8.
[1:24:39] there is therefore no more no
[1:24:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:24:42] Jesus you know the scripture
[1:24:45] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:24:49] that
[1:24:51] and that's the gist of what I wonder I
[1:24:53] want us to I just want to keep it with
[1:24:55] this scripture yeah now there's no
[1:24:58] condemnation to them now that are in
[1:25:00] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:25:03] flesh
[1:25:04] but after the spirit it means everything
[1:25:07] that we do in our lives
[1:25:10] at all costs we must try to see the
[1:25:13] spiritual side of it
[1:25:15] are we together yes because if if you're
[1:25:18] going to apply things as a Believer and
[1:25:20] you apply things all the time physically
[1:25:22] you the flesh is very limited make sure
[1:25:26] you consult your Mentor who is also an
[1:25:29] officer who is also your guide who is
[1:25:32] also your everything concerned apply
[1:25:34] even the things that don't some people
[1:25:36] will say oh how can I just be Consulting
[1:25:38] God for no no consult God in everything
[1:25:42] when there is a thought when there is a
[1:25:44] situation when there's everything
[1:25:46] everything I mean
[1:25:49] take you to the officer
[1:25:51] for the law of the spirit in Christ
[1:25:53] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:25:56] sin and death the law of sin and death
[1:25:58] is the law of this world
[1:26:01] for for what the law could not do in
[1:26:05] that it was weak through the flesh God
[1:26:07] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:26:09] sinful flesh
[1:26:10] and foreseen condemned sin in the flesh
[1:26:14] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:26:16] be fulfilled
[1:26:17] in US
[1:26:19] who walk not after the flesh Paul is
[1:26:21] emphasizing this point
[1:26:24] we cannot walk on the Flesh and also
[1:26:26] walk on the spirit
[1:26:28] we can't
[1:26:29] we cannot be able to be both sides
[1:26:32] that's right that's right as a Believer
[1:26:33] I would say we are on this world we are
[1:26:37] doing whatever we are doing but we are
[1:26:39] actually more Spiritual Beings yes
[1:26:42] every day in every aspect of our life is
[1:26:45] supposedly supposed to be
[1:26:48] okay I'll read verse 7.
[1:26:53] either six
[1:26:54] for to be carnally minded is death
[1:27:00] to be kindly minded is death Yes
[1:27:03] somewhere it says enemity to God
[1:27:07] to be kindly minded
[1:27:09] in other words to always think
[1:27:11] put things and do them things in a
[1:27:13] carnal way
[1:27:14] in a flesh way
[1:27:16] is enmity to God
[1:27:20] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:27:23] peace
[1:27:25] that is why he said Lord forgive them
[1:27:28] for they don't know what they're doing
[1:27:30] how can you do that and then under
[1:27:32] according to the law of sin and death
[1:27:33] you can't yeah
[1:27:36] yeah because the canal mind is enmity
[1:27:38] against God yes that's what I was trying
[1:27:40] to say for it is not it is not subject
[1:27:42] to the law of God
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:48] so I just wanted to encourage you
[1:27:49] brothers and sisters that God has is
[1:27:52] restoring amen he promised to restore if
[1:27:55] I didn't go fully in that message of the
[1:27:58] restoration forgive me bear with me but
[1:28:01] I needed just to emphasize on this
[1:28:02] aspect of
[1:28:04] enforcing the law of God for restoration
[1:28:08] for restoration of your gifts
[1:28:10] restoration of your healing restoration
[1:28:13] of anything that you want the Lord knew
[1:28:16] what he was talking about when he said
[1:28:18] if you ask anything yeah yeah he knew
[1:28:20] yeah
[1:28:21] he knew that there will be a cell phone
[1:28:25] in this day he knew that there's going
[1:28:27] to be anything
[1:28:29] and he said it clearly
[1:28:33] you cannot suffer and struggle as a
[1:28:35] child of God right no no take it to the
[1:28:38] Lord
[1:28:39] because you are not you are above the
[1:28:41] law of sin and flesh
[1:28:44] may the Lord bless you tonight may the
[1:28:47] Lord grant you
[1:28:48] these few ways that I've mentioned here
[1:28:50] that I've said
[1:28:51] and if
[1:28:53] the Lord may he be the after speaker
[1:28:55] maybe the one that will go with you and
[1:28:58] and fine tune what I wanted to convey to
[1:29:01] you that very Holy Spirit we are talking
[1:29:03] about may he be the one amen amen so let
[1:29:08] us all take put the shoulder on the
[1:29:10] wheel and say Lord my job is not much my
[1:29:14] job is to give it to the officer
[1:29:16] there is an agent appointed for that
[1:29:19] leave it there and be comfortable be at
[1:29:22] peace
[1:29:23] when things go wrong he will make them
[1:29:25] right
[1:29:27] Hallelujah you know the song
[1:29:30] so let's pause here
[1:29:33] and be prayerful
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:38] I made a little note there I said the
[1:29:40] demonstration and manifestation of the
[1:29:42] fruits of restoration shows that you are
[1:29:46] obedient to God's law of restoration is
[1:29:50] a powerful code that I ever made
[1:29:52] the demonstration and manifestation of
[1:29:55] the fruits of restoration
[1:29:57] shows that you or we are obedient to
[1:30:01] God's law of restoration so may God help
[1:30:05] us
[1:30:06] let us not be carnal
[1:30:08] let us move away for to be carnally
[1:30:10] minded is enemity to God so we we are
