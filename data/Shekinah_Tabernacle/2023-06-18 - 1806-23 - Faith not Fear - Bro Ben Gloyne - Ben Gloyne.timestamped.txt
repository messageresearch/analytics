[48:49] Lord we love you Lord we thank you for
[48:51] this day in Jesus Christ's name amen
[48:53] amen God bless you may have your seats
[48:56] uh this morning so I want to talk about
[48:57] fear or rather faith and not fear
[49:01] hey man it's interesting to read this
[49:03] about Gideon you know we I won't read it
[49:05] to save time but if you go back to
[49:06] chapter five you know that's uh when
[49:08] when Barrack and um and Deborah have
[49:10] their great victory over over cicera and
[49:13] and and the enemies that said and then
[49:15] the and then the land had rest for 40
[49:17] years and so no doubt Gideon's father
[49:20] you know he was maybe born in that time
[49:22] of risk Gideon was born in that time of
[49:24] rest but then a then a season changed
[49:26] and now the enemy came in and you know
[49:28] started to eat up all their all their
[49:30] food take their crops they didn't have
[49:31] any livestock anymore for you know
[49:33] judging from there from uh uh verse four
[49:36] and you know you see Israel they just
[49:37] made strongholds they went and lived in
[49:39] caves and so basically they just shut
[49:40] themselves away because of the fear of
[49:43] the enemy and how easy is it today where
[49:45] people can be so governed by fear
[49:47] instead of faith that you know they just
[49:49] try and survive through life we're not
[49:51] here just to survive we're here to
[49:52] overcome I mean we're here to be
[49:54] victorious every day because our lord
[49:56] Jesus is Victorious every day everybody
[49:59] see here Gideon you know he just made
[50:00] maybe no doubt you know just got used to
[50:03] living in this kind of a lifestyle and
[50:05] you know there he was threshing weed in
[50:07] secret you know by The Wine Press
[50:08] because of fear of the midianites
[50:10] because he wanted to hide it he was
[50:11] worried if he got caught you know then
[50:13] the enemy's going to come in and take it
[50:14] from him but you know it's amazing how
[50:16] Gideon looked at himself one way but God
[50:18] looked at himself a different way I mean
[50:21] because Gideon did not think himself as
[50:22] a mighty man of Allah but that's what
[50:24] God saw that he was and notice the Lord
[50:26] did not say you will become he said you
[50:28] are and it's the same thing with all the
[50:30] Bride of Jesus Christ every son and
[50:32] daughter of God we are mighty man and
[50:34] woman of Valor boys and girls amen we
[50:36] are Overcomers in this day because of
[50:38] what he has done for us but we can get
[50:40] to a spot where fear rules us instead of
[50:42] faith you know it's very easy you know
[50:45] many times you look at Gideon and you
[50:46] always look for a picture to put up you
[50:48] know it's easy to look at this this
[50:49] moment in the story when they're blowing
[50:51] their trumpets and they break their
[50:52] picture and they shine their light the
[50:53] enemy gets all consumed and destroyed
[50:56] but you know God had to bring them to a
[50:57] place to stand in this position but they
[51:00] already were meant to be in that
[51:01] ordained position but fear had so
[51:02] gripped Israel that all they had was a
[51:04] memory of what God did for them in the
[51:06] past but he was the same God there as he
[51:09] was with Moses he was the same God with
[51:11] Gideon threshing wheat in secret as he
[51:13] was with Joshua but they had forgotten
[51:16] what the lord well they hadn't forgotten
[51:18] what God had done but they forgot that
[51:19] he was a present tense God I mean that
[51:22] could deliver them out of every fan so
[51:24] you know God has to you know we live in
[51:27] a season where fear has gripped the
[51:28] Earth
[51:29] yeah all news is basically bad news
[51:32] these days you know and why because it
[51:34] said that you know the Lord saw through
[51:36] time and saw our season and he said
[51:38] men's Hearts will be failing for fear
[51:40] because why they'll be distress of
[51:42] because upon the Earth there'll be just
[51:44] Earth distress of nations with
[51:46] perplexity and seas and the waves are
[51:48] roaring so so there's problems in the
[51:50] Earth today that cannot be solved there
[51:52] cannot be reconciliation between nations
[51:54] and it's because the demon Over America
[51:57] is fussing with the demon over China and
[51:59] the demon over North Korea is flashing
[52:01] with South Korea and the demon over
[52:03] Japan is fighting with this one and all
[52:05] these different and the demon over New
[52:06] Zealand is trying to back out of it but
[52:08] actually we're we're joined him with the
[52:10] demon in America and in Europe and all
[52:12] these things why because his demon
[52:13] powers fighting and fussing and that
[52:15] causes War so and there's no
[52:17] reconciliation in hell
[52:19] amen there's no peace in Hell demons
[52:21] can't even have peace one with another
[52:23] you're the only way to have peace is
[52:25] when the Prince of Peace comes and takes
[52:27] over and we know before he takes over on
[52:29] the earth he's going to take over in
[52:30] here amen so that's what we need the
[52:32] reason man's hearts are failing them for
[52:34] fear is because they are gripped by fear
[52:38] fear is you know what you know you see
[52:40] so many things these days it's fear is
[52:42] the motivator it's not Faith it's not
[52:45] peace it's not even for a better world
[52:47] they say it is but it's fear you know
[52:50] the climate's changing that's fair you
[52:52] know there's all there's war there's
[52:54] fear epidemics fear health problems fear
[52:57] health and crisis fear economics
[52:59] crashing Fair it's all fair motivating
[53:01] and people can be consumed by it and
[53:04] their hearts fail for fear but I'm so
[53:07] thankful that though we are built the
[53:08] same as everyone else on the street we
[53:10] have someone on the in on the inside of
[53:12] the inside of us that can take the fare
[53:14] away that we can live in this world but
[53:16] not be caught up in the things of this
[53:18] world and we can walk in faith that you
[53:20] can walk into this world with a smile on
[53:22] your face and people can see you and say
[53:24] what's what's going on with that person
[53:26] I want to have what they're on whatever
[53:28] they're on is working for them real good
[53:30] Hallelujah and it's not a pill it's a
[53:32] gospel amen that will change your life
[53:35] forever not just a moment Terry hi amen
[53:37] but an eternal Joy
[53:39] Amen in spite of what's going on now
[53:43] it's incredible when you think about
[53:44] this wind because it's such a contrast
[53:46] in this day where the Lord is here to
[53:50] change us to give us Beauty for Ashes
[53:54] the oil of Joyful morning the Garment of
[53:57] Praise for the spirit of heaviness this
[53:59] world is heavy there's a heaviness on
[54:01] people they don't see a way out they
[54:03] don't see a bright day coming you know
[54:04] it's all negative negative negative but
[54:07] actually we have the we have the good
[54:08] news we have the positive news if you
[54:11] are if you are worried about the future
[54:13] if you're fearful for your family if
[54:16] you're worried about where you're going
[54:17] to be maybe next year fear not
[54:20] you know in the Bible it says that
[54:21] phrase fear not or don't be afraid 365
[54:25] times that's a fair not for every day of
[54:27] the day of the year amen to you wake up
[54:30] you can read fear not
[54:31] amen second of January fear not third of
[54:34] January fear not all the way to December
[54:36] 31st fear not because God doesn't want
[54:38] us to fear amen he wants us to have
[54:40] faith he wants us to have full
[54:42] confidence in him amen not to be worried
[54:45] but sure the world may have a spirit of
[54:46] heaviness but no we have the Garment of
[54:48] Praise I mean we have the oil of Joy
[54:51] amen the anointing of joy is upon the
[54:53] bride of Christ amen we don't meet maybe
[54:56] you have morning but let your morning
[54:58] turn to Joy and maybe you're sad believe
[55:00] your sadness turn to laughing amen let
[55:03] it let it let God change it from the
[55:05] negative into the positive because we
[55:07] know we're human like anyone else we're
[55:09] not exempt from the Troubles of this
[55:11] world
[55:12] we don't live in a bubble right we don't
[55:15] live separated from the troubles we're
[55:17] not immune from the spirit of this age
[55:18] we're not immune from the trouble that
[55:20] it's amazing our Spirits can spread
[55:22] you're an atmosphere can change an
[55:24] attitude can be in a room it can just be
[55:26] a spirit there and you know you know it
[55:29] may start off positive someone else
[55:30] walks in or like a thundercloud and a
[55:32] passive aggressive it can change the
[55:34] whole atmosphere
[55:35] but we don't have to be caught up in
[55:37] that kind of thing we can be positive
[55:39] even though it looks like our world has
[55:41] literally falling apart
[55:43] amen we can you know you say you could
[55:45] have the worst day anyone's ever had
[55:47] even worse than job but see it's the
[55:49] difference between you and job is you
[55:51] know your Redeemer liveth before you
[55:52] step into the trail I mean he didn't
[55:54] know what would happen to him when he
[55:56] died he didn't know even where his
[55:58] children went but after that trial says
[55:59] now I know my redeemer liveth I'll Stand
[56:02] in my flesh I'll see God and on this
[56:03] Earth I'll stand with him see we know
[56:05] that before we've stepped into the trail
[56:07] see all he knew was the sheer blood of
[56:09] the lamb but yet that held him in the
[56:10] trial amen how much more people have the
[56:13] blood of Jesus Christ amen has actually
[56:15] had a visitation from Heaven the baptism
[56:17] of the Holy Ghost and you know where you
[56:19] come from and you know where you're
[56:20] going Hallelujah
[56:25] praise God
[56:27] we're allowed to feel anxious we're
[56:30] allowed to feel worried
[56:31] don't no okay let's just get one thing
[56:34] out of our hearts right now if you're
[56:36] scared of something that's that doesn't
[56:37] mean you're not a believer
[56:39] right if you're afraid of something
[56:40] doesn't mean you're not a Believer right
[56:42] because we have the same emotional realm
[56:44] like everyone else right but we have
[56:46] someone who's here to change the whole
[56:48] picture right but we're not meant to
[56:50] live fearful but you may be afraid of
[56:52] something but don't let that fear grip
[56:53] your life don't let it run your life no
[56:55] faith Divine love is meant to run your
[56:57] life
[56:58] I mean to get that out of your mind you
[57:00] say well I'm scared and the devil says
[57:02] well you can't be a believer then he's a
[57:04] liar
[57:05] everything that comes out of his mouth
[57:07] maybe even the truth is still alive why
[57:10] because his motive of giving you the
[57:12] truth what is it just like Adam and Eve
[57:14] his motive of quoting most of the
[57:16] scripture to Eve it was to bring death
[57:18] into the world it wasn't a helper none
[57:20] it wasn't a lift or higher anyway it was
[57:22] to destroy and make them fall from their
[57:24] position so as I say even if the devil's
[57:26] telling you the truth his motivation is
[57:28] evil
[57:30] oh my yeah let's let's have a let's have
[57:33] a bonfire it's winter time it's a good
[57:35] time to have a fire Hallelujah
[57:37] praise God Amen so that's why she didn't
[57:40] do he said it because you know to give
[57:42] them give unto them Beauty for Ashes the
[57:44] oil of joy for mourning the Garment of
[57:46] Praise for the spirit of heaviness amen
[57:49] that they might be called the Trees of
[57:50] righteous the planting of the Lord that
[57:51] he might be glorified see God wants to
[57:54] be glorified amen see we should never
[57:57] let fear grip us
[58:02] see Timothy was in a place there in
[58:03] second Timothy and you know Paul had to
[58:05] encourage him
[58:07] he was he was a young Minister he was A
[58:09] Gifted Man God had been you know God had
[58:12] been using him he's a genuine believer
[58:13] but it's amazing how how how God will
[58:16] begin to start using someone and
[58:17] automatically the firefighters are there
[58:20] to try and put out that fire to try and
[58:22] dampen enthusiasm to try and just knock
[58:25] them a little bit of a way that the that
[58:27] the fervancy and the joy that they had
[58:28] you know because it's amazing how you
[58:31] know the devil just wants to make
[58:32] everyone the same
[58:34] and we have a tall poppy syndrome here
[58:36] in New Zealand I said there's no cutting
[58:38] poppies in this place if someone's
[58:41] growing I say can I hold on to your
[58:42] branches as you as as you grow up so you
[58:44] can lift me up to where you are you know
[58:46] we should never be jealous remember the
[58:48] Bible says that pilate knew that the
[58:50] scribes and Pharisees had actually given
[58:52] Jesus over to be crucified because of
[58:54] Envy because of jealousy that was the
[58:57] reason you go read it in the gospels the
[58:58] reason they crucified him was because of
[59:00] jealousy why because he wasn't just
[59:02] quoting scripture he was the scripture I
[59:04] mean he was just having a tradition he
[59:07] had something that they wanted but they
[59:08] weren't willing to surrender to get it
[59:11] amens away because their whole religion
[59:13] was based on fear
[59:15] and we'll get into that later but you
[59:17] see it was all fair that gripped them
[59:19] but then here was the prince of peace
[59:20] and they crucified him because of Envy
[59:23] they were jealous
[59:24] amen so he would so Paul would would
[59:27] would be encouraging Timothy he says
[59:30] remember where I uh wherefore I put the
[59:32] in remembrance that thou syrup the gift
[59:34] of God which is only by the putting out
[59:36] of my hands now we know that he would
[59:38] say in previously I can only fit so many
[59:40] scriptures on the board I don't you know
[59:41] I could maybe just put the whole Bible
[59:42] up there but you know it would say
[59:44] before this that the gift that was in
[59:45] your grand grandmother was in your
[59:47] mother's now and you and brother bam
[59:49] said that that gift was not placed in
[59:51] Paul I mean in in Timothy because Paul
[59:53] put his hands on him that's not what it
[59:55] means it means that that gift was
[59:56] actually they could see it operating and
[59:58] they laid hands on him prayed for him
[1:00:00] and sent him out recognizing the gift
[1:00:02] was already in him right because you
[1:00:04] can't impart spiritual gifts by the
[1:00:05] laying on of hands amen but but Paul is
[1:00:08] saying remember how there's a gift of
[1:00:10] God you've got to Stir It Up fear has
[1:00:12] tried to you Timothy but God
[1:00:14] doesn't want you to be crippled fear has
[1:00:16] tried to disable the gift of God in your
[1:00:18] life Timothy but I'm here to stir up in
[1:00:20] remembrance that this was in you before
[1:00:22] you even called no doubt you saw it in
[1:00:24] your grandmother but he didn't fully
[1:00:26] understand it you even saw it in your
[1:00:27] mother you didn't fully even understand
[1:00:28] that well she'd sit there and at your
[1:00:30] bedside and preach to you and you know
[1:00:31] share Bible stories and sing songs and
[1:00:34] that was a gift of God being manifested
[1:00:36] that was actually a preaching gift on
[1:00:37] display but that same gift was in him so
[1:00:40] Amen to No Doubt when he saw God begin
[1:00:42] to use his life he would say hey that
[1:00:44] that was in my mother that was in my
[1:00:46] grandmother now to me and I didn't put
[1:00:48] it here amen and if I didn't put it here
[1:00:50] I can't take it out and if God put it
[1:00:53] here no one else can take it out so
[1:00:55] you're going to let God just use the
[1:00:56] gift that's in your life
[1:00:58] hallelujah amen so now he says stir up
[1:01:01] that remembrance right for God has not
[1:01:02] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:01:05] and of love and of a sound mind now
[1:01:07] Timothy even though he's in the state he
[1:01:09] didn't quit preaching he didn't quit
[1:01:11] being a Believer but he just no doubt
[1:01:13] withdrew within himself because fear had
[1:01:16] gripped him and how many sadly Believers
[1:01:18] will be uh in this kind of condition
[1:01:21] because of fear yet they looked apart
[1:01:23] they played the part they sing the part
[1:01:25] but faith is not operating like it
[1:01:28] should because of fear you know where
[1:01:30] people come to a place where they're
[1:01:31] afraid to step out in faith to take God
[1:01:34] at his word their courage is gone they
[1:01:36] say well we're praying about it and but
[1:01:37] it may say plainly in the word to do it
[1:01:39] but they're afraid to step out and
[1:01:42] actually step into the unknown God help
[1:01:44] us that we have courage today Amy
[1:01:46] remember this goes all over the place
[1:01:48] I'm not maybe not just talking to you
[1:01:49] you know just anyway don't take it too
[1:01:51] personal amen so don't or maybe take it
[1:01:53] personal hey if God's delivering mail
[1:01:55] here it is amen but you see the problem
[1:01:57] is people the I guess curse of prophet
[1:01:59] says with the Full Gospel people or any
[1:02:01] is because they are afraid we are not
[1:02:04] called to be afraid I mean we're called
[1:02:06] to be full of faith I mean just because
[1:02:08] the world may be panicking amen doesn't
[1:02:11] mean we need to panic because we've got
[1:02:13] a way of Escape amen we've got a way out
[1:02:15] of here we've got a God that provides
[1:02:17] all our needs amen he's still Jehovah
[1:02:19] Jireh just like brother Michael serving
[1:02:21] Jack said to us around our dinner tablet
[1:02:22] said you know asked us a question what
[1:02:24] was the service that brother Brown
[1:02:25] preached the most I said well maybe yo
[1:02:28] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:29] and remember no it's not it's Jehovah
[1:02:31] Jireh
[1:02:32] so if you're walking with God God can
[1:02:35] provide something out of nothing
[1:02:37] that lamb was I mean that Ram wasn't
[1:02:39] there when when when uh Abraham walked
[1:02:42] up the mountain he turned around and saw
[1:02:43] it in the thicket he walked past that
[1:02:45] Thicket right but when he was there
[1:02:47] ready to give give Isaac go go all the
[1:02:49] way with God God created that Ram in the
[1:02:52] thicket see so why God is still Jehovah
[1:02:54] Jireh so let's walk on with God see
[1:02:57] that's the biggest cursor is on Full
[1:02:58] Gospel people you know we're Full Gospel
[1:03:00] people too you know
[1:03:01] it's not the Breather it's actually the
[1:03:03] believer
[1:03:04] right or any other people is because
[1:03:06] they're afraid God has made provision
[1:03:08] but we're afraid to take his word for it
[1:03:10] if you wasn't afraid tonight why you
[1:03:12] would take your healing by faith and
[1:03:14] know what God promised it and the thing
[1:03:16] would be just so Plum far away from you
[1:03:18] afraid scared and I've noticed pardon me
[1:03:20] and it's the reason I'm such a believer
[1:03:22] in healing I know if you can get away
[1:03:24] from that scare and get love in that
[1:03:26] place something's going to happen see if
[1:03:28] you just get that scared because the
[1:03:29] devil never paints a good picture
[1:03:31] anyways gives you the worst case
[1:03:33] scenario basically you're all going to
[1:03:35] die right now but you know if he if he
[1:03:37] just cut out his filler and gave you the
[1:03:39] conclusion that's what he would say you
[1:03:41] did you're done goodbye this is over
[1:03:42] finito whatever you know but but the
[1:03:45] thing is if we start confessing that in
[1:03:47] every situation we're actually
[1:03:49] manifesting a spirit of fear we should
[1:03:51] never confess the negative amen we
[1:03:54] should always confess positive right we
[1:03:56] should never confess negative well it's
[1:03:57] never going to happen and this is always
[1:03:59] going to be this way and this is going
[1:04:00] to be the worst ever and you know this
[1:04:02] year is going to be the worst year of my
[1:04:04] life no this is the best year of your
[1:04:06] life where are you closer to the coming
[1:04:08] of the Lord where are you closer to
[1:04:10] these bodies being changed amen where
[1:04:12] are you closer to the dead in Christ
[1:04:13] raising Hallelujah we are a year closer
[1:04:16] than we were a year ago to sing our lord
[1:04:18] Jesus face to face this is a very good
[1:04:21] year
[1:04:22] praise God what do you mean well you
[1:04:25] don't know what I'm going through
[1:04:29] what does it matter what wrong streets
[1:04:32] of gold is it going to be in your mind
[1:04:33] you know Jesus is yeah it says in the
[1:04:36] Bible he's going to come wipe every tear
[1:04:38] from our eye and thing is because we're
[1:04:40] in harmony with them all the tears have
[1:04:41] to go he's basically got a one big big
[1:04:44] delete button
[1:04:45] I mean of all the things that we hold so
[1:04:47] big and so heavy they won't even be
[1:04:49] remembered sure we will remember every
[1:04:51] testimony of everything he did for us in
[1:04:53] our lives right we're not going to walk
[1:04:54] up into heaven with a blank mind and not
[1:04:56] remember anything of the earth we're
[1:04:57] going to remember some things we're
[1:04:58] going to remember the day he called us
[1:05:00] we're going to remember the day his
[1:05:01] Mercy was new we're going to remember
[1:05:03] the day that we went off the path and he
[1:05:04] brought us back we're gonna remember the
[1:05:06] day when we were sick and he healed us I
[1:05:07] remember the day we had nothing in our
[1:05:09] backyard and yet God put something in
[1:05:10] there wait a minute of the day when he
[1:05:12] saved our children we remember the day
[1:05:13] when the Holy Ghost moved in power we're
[1:05:15] going to remember all those things when
[1:05:17] we prayed and prayed and prayed and God
[1:05:18] answered that prayer we're going to
[1:05:20] remember every single one of those
[1:05:22] moments because God gives us those
[1:05:24] testimonies to praise His great name
[1:05:27] hallelujah amen so we're gonna we're
[1:05:29] gonna remember some things but there's a
[1:05:31] lot of things of life we will not
[1:05:33] remember and God won't remember them
[1:05:35] either they will be gone
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:38] so
[1:05:39] let perspective's a good thing eh oh
[1:05:42] yeah just to zoom out you know if you
[1:05:44] look under a microscope or you're
[1:05:46] looking at a flee's leg or or it's
[1:05:48] pincers has you ever seen like those big
[1:05:50] uh high high resolution images of like
[1:05:53] the mouth of some little mutt you don't
[1:05:54] even know existed they look like they
[1:05:56] could just swallow you a one big gulp
[1:05:59] but when you zoom out
[1:06:01] you think where's that guy gone you
[1:06:03] don't even know where he is but the
[1:06:05] devil wants to put everything under a
[1:06:06] microscope make it so much bigger than
[1:06:07] it really is I mean but under the blood
[1:06:09] of Jesus Christ what really matters amen
[1:06:12] and compassion to eternal life and to
[1:06:14] walk with God and denomin the power of
[1:06:16] his resurrection Hallelujah The
[1:06:18] Fellowship of the sufferings what really
[1:06:19] matters
[1:06:22] Hallelujah what are you trying to do
[1:06:24] replace scare with love
[1:06:27] amen because he found you he ain't gonna
[1:06:29] lose you I mean he saved you he can't
[1:06:31] lose you my daddy's bigger than all the
[1:06:34] daddies in the universe
[1:06:36] amen holy no one can beat him up no one
[1:06:38] can hug time no one can pin him down why
[1:06:41] because my Lord Jesus is greater than
[1:06:42] them all all the hordes of Hell come pin
[1:06:45] my Lord G this couldn't hold him the
[1:06:48] grave couldn't keep him Roman Legions
[1:06:50] couldn't seal him amen God could not be
[1:06:52] bound and God will not be bound in this
[1:06:54] moment either Hallelujah
[1:06:57] amen but you see now fear fear manifest
[1:07:00] in different ways see there's only two
[1:07:02] faculties that govern a human
[1:07:04] and one of them is Faith which brings
[1:07:06] results who wants results
[1:07:09] who's ever had a boss I need results
[1:07:10] right now
[1:07:12] what's that Faith that's what fight
[1:07:14] fight but Faith brings the results
[1:07:16] see Faith breaks through it's not you
[1:07:18] bringing the results it's faith that
[1:07:20] brings results amen it's our faith in
[1:07:22] the promised word that brings the
[1:07:24] results it's not our human ability that
[1:07:25] brings any results and the other is fear
[1:07:28] which has no value in it at all
[1:07:30] it's amazing what people put value in
[1:07:32] there used to be a thing trending on the
[1:07:34] internet where I cut uh nfts or like I
[1:07:37] remember the acronym but it's basically
[1:07:38] virtual art that people solve for
[1:07:41] digital currency
[1:07:43] it's not physical
[1:07:45] it wasn't some famous painting it could
[1:07:47] just literally be a picture of my phone
[1:07:50] worth millions of dollars
[1:07:52] it's like fear
[1:07:54] the devil puts a lot of value on fear
[1:07:56] and and he tries to put that value and
[1:07:59] say this is what it's worth and put it
[1:08:00] upon you just like those things on the
[1:08:02] internet but I think the whole thing's
[1:08:04] crashed and burned and gone but people
[1:08:06] were spending millions of dollars on
[1:08:08] things that dividend didn't even exist
[1:08:12] and that's what the devil does with fear
[1:08:15] it has no value to it it can't help you
[1:08:17] none it never did you any good amen it's
[1:08:20] just like that extra big cheeseburger
[1:08:22] you ate the other day it didn't help you
[1:08:23] none right it may have tasted good at
[1:08:26] the time but hey you still paying for it
[1:08:28] right now and sometimes fear can
[1:08:29] actually be people get used to
[1:08:31] entertaining fear they get used to
[1:08:33] thinking a certain way I'm not against
[1:08:35] McDonald's by the way you just spend a
[1:08:37] bit of time with me we'll be driving
[1:08:38] through
[1:08:39] all right
[1:08:42] we'll go later
[1:08:44] but you know but the devil puts a lot of
[1:08:48] value on something that's value-less
[1:08:49] which is fair I can't help you none amen
[1:08:53] faith is of God fears of the devil fear
[1:08:56] makes you weary that's whoever's felt
[1:08:58] weary
[1:08:59] tired worn out it's actually a spirit of
[1:09:02] fear trying to govern your life
[1:09:04] that's why if you feel hey there's a
[1:09:06] difference between feeling tired and
[1:09:08] feeling weary
[1:09:09] you can feel tired but yet you're still
[1:09:11] doing you're still going right but but
[1:09:13] you can have a good night's sleep you
[1:09:14] can have the best diet whatever but you
[1:09:16] can still feel weary why it's a spirit
[1:09:18] of fear trying to drag you down we're
[1:09:21] not ordained to be weary
[1:09:23] we're ordained to be happy you know God
[1:09:26] wants you to be happy whatever age you
[1:09:28] are God wants you to be happy he wants
[1:09:30] you to be content he wants you to be
[1:09:32] loving him he wants you to be positive
[1:09:34] amen I mean that's what he wants you to
[1:09:37] be this morning if you're thinking is
[1:09:38] always negative throw it in the fire
[1:09:41] take that folder and go go shift delete
[1:09:45] don't put it in the recycle bin get rid
[1:09:48] of it and then do a deep clean on your
[1:09:50] whatever you do with a hard drive that
[1:09:52] you can't find it after it's been
[1:09:53] deleted right just get rid of it amen
[1:09:55] fill your Hardware
[1:09:58] with Good Things fill it with good
[1:10:00] programs I mean fill it with good apps
[1:10:02] right fill it with good word amen
[1:10:04] positive thinking Amen brother I said we
[1:10:06] should never think a negative thought we
[1:10:08] may not be able to stop it coming into
[1:10:10] our mind but there's some guests you
[1:10:12] should never entertain
[1:10:13] we are very hospitable people we are
[1:10:15] Fellowship junkies all right but there's
[1:10:18] some people some things we should never
[1:10:19] fellowship with that's a negative
[1:10:21] thought that's a negative conversation
[1:10:23] we should always swing a negative into
[1:10:25] the positive amen and you'll find people
[1:10:28] who love Negative they won't talk to you
[1:10:29] much longer after that that person's
[1:10:32] always positive that they just they just
[1:10:34] got blinkers on no no my blinkers have
[1:10:36] been taken off because I can see from
[1:10:38] eternity to Eternity so everything's
[1:10:41] good I know where I came from I know
[1:10:43] where I'm going I'm not I'm not an
[1:10:45] ostrich that berries has hit in the sand
[1:10:48] we see the world's condition we see the
[1:10:49] trouble in the land we see everything
[1:10:51] that's going on but yet God is greater
[1:10:53] than it all and God is in control of
[1:10:55] everything and we don't need to fear
[1:10:56] nothing that comes upon the Earth yeah
[1:10:58] some people say well man you must have a
[1:11:00] lot of faith to have kids in this day
[1:11:02] well what about the martyrs and the Dark
[1:11:04] Ages I
[1:11:05] that'd be pregnant you know when a
[1:11:07] pregnant nine months they were living
[1:11:09] under the danger of being caught their
[1:11:11] bellies ripped open and the child fed to
[1:11:14] the Hogs while they bleed to death stuff
[1:11:16] like that happened by the church by the
[1:11:18] way Inquisition different things they
[1:11:20] lived under that fear that that could
[1:11:22] happen it didn't hinder them
[1:11:25] they knew people that had happened to it
[1:11:26] didn't hinder them hey man they kept
[1:11:29] walking with God they had courage I mean
[1:11:31] they realized hey my last breath here is
[1:11:33] my first breath there I mean I knew
[1:11:35] where they were going they knew where
[1:11:36] they came from so that so the conditions
[1:11:38] of the world did not stop them
[1:11:40] having families raising children having
[1:11:44] Church sure they are wise about it but
[1:11:46] you know what I mean they didn't let
[1:11:47] those things grip them
[1:11:49] because imagine if we come into service
[1:11:51] like imagine if we were back there in
[1:11:52] the Roman era even even during the Cathy
[1:11:55] or the Reformation or whatever time
[1:11:56] where this kind of church would be
[1:11:58] banned
[1:11:59] and we come to church and there's a
[1:12:01] prayer request
[1:12:02] please pray for the Clifford family
[1:12:04] because they were arrested last night
[1:12:07] and a few weeks before that I'll just
[1:12:10] use us the glowing family was arrested
[1:12:11] they got burned at the stake
[1:12:14] but yet we'd still come to church we'd
[1:12:16] still be Believers we couldn't recant
[1:12:18] because something in US wouldn't let us
[1:12:20] do it that was him holding us
[1:12:22] amen something keeps holding me right
[1:12:24] it's not us it's him but but imagine
[1:12:27] living in that kind of environment
[1:12:29] that would be a different kind of every
[1:12:31] service would be a bit kind of different
[1:12:32] service you know you would see your
[1:12:34] brothers and sisters come through the
[1:12:35] door you take God bless
[1:12:37] Ed it's so good to see you here again
[1:12:39] it would mean something wouldn't it I
[1:12:41] mean to gather together and you know
[1:12:44] Hallelujah but they didn't let fear grip
[1:12:46] them
[1:12:48] they let Faith grip them yeah yeah let's
[1:12:50] let Faith grip us today let that Faith
[1:12:53] take control of our lives like never
[1:12:54] before
[1:12:55] amen see fear Makes You Weary fear makes
[1:12:58] you wonder
[1:12:59] don't wonder
[1:13:01] what about this and what this may happen
[1:13:03] this may happen this may happen no no
[1:13:04] take your thoughts subject to the word
[1:13:06] of God the Bible says we take every
[1:13:08] thought captive
[1:13:09] to the word of God right so fear makes
[1:13:12] us wonder what's going to happen I
[1:13:13] wonder what this person is thinking
[1:13:15] about I wonder what this person thinks
[1:13:16] about me in this moment what if they saw
[1:13:18] me just relaxing here for a moment who
[1:13:20] cares are they your God
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] no no I'm glad no one said amen people
[1:13:27] are listening yeah but who are we living
[1:13:29] before to please
[1:13:32] amen see if I was going to die in the
[1:13:34] morning what good would it do me to get
[1:13:35] all scared up I mean stewed up about it
[1:13:38] what if I was going to be electrocuted
[1:13:39] in the morning and my life had to end
[1:13:41] tomorrow morning what good would it do
[1:13:42] me to worry about it
[1:13:44] all right well that's a big statement
[1:13:45] you've never been there but what good
[1:13:47] would it do to worry about
[1:13:49] it well they say what good would it do
[1:13:51] to have faith faith can sign my pardon
[1:13:52] yeah sure that's value there's value and
[1:13:55] Faith don't be wary don't be scared
[1:13:57] don't be upset just have faith and
[1:13:59] believe the only thing you can do is
[1:14:00] have faith you have to have love first
[1:14:03] for love produces faith for perfect love
[1:14:05] get it perfect love cast out all fear
[1:14:08] play perfect love take control say Lord
[1:14:10] Come Fill Me Lord take fear out of my
[1:14:12] life Lord you see Lord I've been so
[1:14:13] caught up in what's going on and there
[1:14:15] are genuine concerns that we have in
[1:14:17] life isn't it amen there's not empty
[1:14:19] things that we're worried about we're
[1:14:20] worried about genuine things right but
[1:14:22] they say Lord don't let the fear of what
[1:14:24] could happen govern my life Lord but may
[1:14:27] Faith come Lord amen Change My Heart
[1:14:29] Lord Jesus that I can Rejoice no matter
[1:14:32] is what's going on what cause faith can
[1:14:33] sign
[1:14:34] alpatum
[1:14:36] you know we're going to realize by the
[1:14:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost we no longer
[1:14:40] fear death
[1:14:42] we no longer feed it the fear of death
[1:14:44] is gone when Jesus comes in the fear of
[1:14:47] death leaves
[1:14:48] amen I remember my well I didn't know at
[1:14:51] the time but when when when Christine
[1:14:52] was in Switzerland before we ever met
[1:14:54] she had an anaphylactic reaction from
[1:14:55] some Tramadol after a bike accident and
[1:14:58] and she was actually dying and she felt
[1:15:01] herself liver body
[1:15:02] and her auntie is not even a believer
[1:15:03] was right there and she was crying by a
[1:15:05] bedside and as she was leaving she just
[1:15:07] found absolute love and peace
[1:15:09] and she was and she thought to herself
[1:15:11] if only I could tell my auntie don't be
[1:15:13] sad it's so wonderful
[1:15:16] you can go ask her she'll fill in the
[1:15:17] details but you see but that's how a
[1:15:20] Believer is we don't fear death because
[1:15:22] heaven has come down got a hold of our
[1:15:25] souls and Heaven's going to carry us
[1:15:28] away Jesus came down remember when he
[1:15:30] met you what did he do he put his claim
[1:15:32] on you and the devil can't kick his
[1:15:34] claim off he said This one belongs to me
[1:15:36] they're not your Satan they're mine for
[1:15:39] eternity they came from me they're going
[1:15:40] back to me and I can't lose one
[1:15:43] Hallelujah so you know death is not a
[1:15:45] fearful thing to the believer why
[1:15:47] because Jesus Takes all fear of death
[1:15:49] away
[1:15:52] well then you may think but
[1:15:55] what if he's not happy with me what if I
[1:15:58] failed him we found him every day
[1:16:01] we need his blood every day
[1:16:03] some people say there's no more blood I
[1:16:05] beg to differ I need it
[1:16:07] amen he's my intercessor he's my
[1:16:08] mediator amen he's my Advocate amen he's
[1:16:11] my propitiation He's My All In All
[1:16:12] without him we have we are lost amen we
[1:16:16] cannot be a Christian in our own
[1:16:17] strength brother Brown said you just you
[1:16:19] know you know if God just took his head
[1:16:21] off him just for a moment
[1:16:23] he'd be an absolute wreck yes and the
[1:16:25] same thing with you and I I mean if God
[1:16:27] ever just lifts his hand up just lifts
[1:16:28] his finger off a little bit I mean we're
[1:16:30] in trouble but God ain't gonna do that
[1:16:32] God's hand is upon us
[1:16:34] Hallelujah I trust you believe that
[1:16:36] about yourself this morning
[1:16:38] amen see
[1:16:40] amen and deliver them who are through
[1:16:42] death uh fear of death we're all their
[1:16:45] lifetimes subject to bondage what were
[1:16:48] they subject to all their lives the fear
[1:16:50] of death yeah basis I've delivered them
[1:16:52] yeah I've delivered you
[1:16:54] praise God this is another hypothetical
[1:16:56] this is reality
[1:16:58] we don't feed death
[1:17:01] the only thing that we have a concern
[1:17:02] for is those we leave behind
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:06] see when you're single there's no one
[1:17:08] you're going to look after you're like
[1:17:09] praise God just take me Lord I walk with
[1:17:11] you and be not you'll just take me but
[1:17:13] then you think but Lord what if you took
[1:17:14] me what about my family what about my
[1:17:16] friends what about my loved ones so you
[1:17:18] have that burden because the love of God
[1:17:19] isn't just for ourselves it goes to it
[1:17:22] goes out to everyone you know see so
[1:17:24] that's why there's always that in the
[1:17:26] back of your mind maybe it's just mine
[1:17:28] Lord if I died right now I know where
[1:17:30] I'm going but what about my family
[1:17:32] what about my brothers and sisters what
[1:17:34] you know what about them Lord
[1:17:36] go look after us
[1:17:38] I'm not going anywhere by the way

[1:20:35] confidence is in me you have your
[1:20:36] confidence in the wrong person your
[1:20:38] confidence should be in Jesus Christ the
[1:20:40] word I will fail you I'll disappoint you
[1:20:42] I'll upset you I'll offend you I'll do
[1:20:44] all kinds of things because I'm human
[1:20:46] too
[1:20:47] Hallelujah but he will never disappoint
[1:20:50] you so you're confident should not even
[1:20:52] be in this church it shouldn't be in the
[1:20:53] ministry it should be in Jesus Christ
[1:20:55] the word right that's who your
[1:20:57] confidence should be in
[1:20:58] amen so amen because see we have
[1:21:01] boldness in the dead judgment because as
[1:21:03] he is so we are in this world
[1:21:05] so we're not going to heaven under a
[1:21:08] death sentence the only one who goes on
[1:21:11] the death sentence is the devil
[1:21:14] remember all of a sin from time and
[1:21:16] before there was time is on his
[1:21:18] shoulders he'll give an account for the
[1:21:20] whole thing oh wow he'll say no no this
[1:21:21] is not my file but God will say no but
[1:21:23] because of my blood it's your file now
[1:21:25] now this is being gloin's file yes I
[1:21:27] don't know because of my blood it's
[1:21:28] yours you're going to give an account
[1:21:30] for this file amen and he won't be able
[1:21:32] to dodge it he can't do any blame
[1:21:34] shifting up in heaven and the great one
[1:21:36] third judgment he'll pack it all to Hell
[1:21:37] upon his own shoulders and burn and pay
[1:21:39] for it
[1:21:40] Hallelujah that's what the blood of
[1:21:42] Jesus Christ does it takes all the sins
[1:21:43] that we should have been punished for
[1:21:45] takes it off us transfers us on
[1:21:48] transfers it onto the head of our
[1:21:49] accuser and then he takes it to the Lake
[1:21:51] of Fire and he's punished for all the
[1:21:54] wrong that's ever been done because he's
[1:21:55] the originator of it all Hallelujah
[1:21:59] and we stand undefiled redeemed amen
[1:22:01] Guiltless perfect in his sight in the
[1:22:03] sight of God himself amen because fear
[1:22:06] hath torment of these tormenting
[1:22:08] thoughts in your mind you've got to
[1:22:09] realize that's not you that's not God it
[1:22:13] doesn't belong to you that's not your
[1:22:14] mail you've been opening the wrong
[1:22:16] packages right it doesn't belong to you
[1:22:19] it may feel like it's yours but fear
[1:22:21] hath torment and fear does not belong to
[1:22:23] you
[1:22:24] fear never was meant to belong to the
[1:22:26] human race do you know that it never was
[1:22:28] meant to be our portion
[1:22:30] and you got to realize why do I have
[1:22:32] this fear because remember uh anything
[1:22:35] any thought process of the devil it's
[1:22:37] like a hamster on a wheel there's no
[1:22:39] conclusion
[1:22:40] you'll jump on it you'll run through a
[1:22:42] thought pattern and you'll run through
[1:22:43] it again and a different angle and
[1:22:46] you'll feel like a motorbike guy one of
[1:22:48] those big big orb things going around
[1:22:50] and around and there's no way out and
[1:22:52] it's not fun
[1:22:54] okay that's the devil's thought pattern
[1:22:56] but God's because he's a counselor he
[1:22:58] wants to come to a conclusion right so
[1:23:01] you know God is dealing with you because
[1:23:02] he comes to a conclusion and that
[1:23:04] conclusion always is a way of Escape
[1:23:06] it's not a condemnation it's not like
[1:23:08] going through a maze you come to a dead
[1:23:10] end God does not have dead ends he has a
[1:23:12] way of Escape okay so that's how you
[1:23:14] know it's God or it's the devil the
[1:23:16] devil just puts you on a hamster wheel
[1:23:17] there's no conclusion no way out it just
[1:23:20] gets worse God gives you a conclusion
[1:23:22] and there's a way of Escape
[1:23:24] Hallelujah I'm so glad he's here to get
[1:23:27] us out amen
[1:23:30] amen the biggest trouble there is in the
[1:23:32] church there's a bunch of fear people
[1:23:33] always scared and that's of the devil
[1:23:35] don't be scared be brave you don't have
[1:23:37] there ain't nothing to be frayed about I
[1:23:40] like that
[1:23:41] let's not be afraid
[1:23:43] Hallelujah but you see now
[1:23:45] fear because it makes a weary it
[1:23:48] actually makes us forget who we are
[1:23:49] makes us makes us come to a place of
[1:23:52] spiritual Amnesia where we don't want
[1:23:54] nothing spiritual no more
[1:23:56] see there's something in the people of
[1:23:58] God that love the spirit of God but if
[1:24:00] we get into a carnal way we don't want
[1:24:02] to be nearest presence because a carnal
[1:24:05] man knows especially a Believer knows
[1:24:07] that God can come down and speak right
[1:24:09] to them
[1:24:10] the preacher could be preaching on
[1:24:11] something this whole thought can be
[1:24:13] changed and be speaking right to what
[1:24:14] you've been talking even driving here or
[1:24:16] something you've been doing because the
[1:24:18] word is still a discern of the thoughts
[1:24:20] and tense of the heart so carnal man
[1:24:22] will try and hide from where God is
[1:24:23] moving he'll stay away but yet look like
[1:24:26] a Believer act like a Believer but won't
[1:24:27] want to be part of where God comes down
[1:24:29] into a meeting or to account you know I
[1:24:31] remember so there's no one here by the
[1:24:32] way but someone at our last Camp was
[1:24:35] sitting at the front but on the Sunday
[1:24:37] night which is where the time of God
[1:24:38] comes down as Main Service you know
[1:24:40] because everyone has expectation about
[1:24:41] it last night right but God's been
[1:24:43] building building he pours out his
[1:24:45] Spirit now there's no one here okay so
[1:24:47] I'm not I'm not looking at anyone
[1:24:48] but but the the first service is there
[1:24:52] in the front on that service they are in
[1:24:53] the back I thought why is this I thought
[1:24:56] something's not right here
[1:24:58] because you'd think if you're at the
[1:24:59] front you stay at the front and if you
[1:25:01] really want a touch from God you'll be
[1:25:02] at the front if you can yeah
[1:25:04] yeah but you see a cardinal man will try
[1:25:06] and hide from that outpouring he'll
[1:25:08] especially when there's a gift like
[1:25:09] brother kaijo will go and pray for
[1:25:10] someone and discern exactly what's going
[1:25:12] on in their lives as he's praying
[1:25:14] they'll hide from that thing
[1:25:16] so so what happened but why is that
[1:25:18] because of fear which makes it weary
[1:25:20] which is like then it makes it what does
[1:25:22] it do it it produces it at Amnesia that
[1:25:26] people don't want something that's
[1:25:27] spiritual show about quote the prophet
[1:25:29] they'll read the Bible and listen to the
[1:25:31] message they'll come to church but I
[1:25:32] don't want the spiritual side the
[1:25:34] anointing of God to come down and touch
[1:25:36] your hearts who wants God to touch their
[1:25:38] heart today I want God to change me Lord
[1:25:40] if I need be exposed expose me Lord if I
[1:25:43] got sin in my life that you need to deal
[1:25:44] with Here I Am Lord I mean I think it's
[1:25:47] because it's all for our good
[1:25:49] amen amen
[1:25:51] praise the Lord but you see fear
[1:25:53] comes in
[1:25:56] when there shouldn't be fear see man
[1:25:58] wasn't made to feel fear it's amazing
[1:26:01] when you think about the first time man
[1:26:02] ever felt fear was in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:04] after the fall they had never felt this
[1:26:06] emotion before they had never felt fear
[1:26:09] that never had worry they never had any
[1:26:11] kind of feeling of what will happen when
[1:26:13] I come into the presence of God they
[1:26:15] only felt joy and love and peace and
[1:26:19] that longing because brother and said
[1:26:21] you know God would come down in the cool
[1:26:22] of the evening and he'd have church with
[1:26:24] his children and they go to the great
[1:26:26] Cathedral under the great big trees
[1:26:28] there and you know they'd be waiting for
[1:26:30] God to come down then he'd step into the
[1:26:32] garden and they'll hear the voice of God
[1:26:34] walking through the garden and no doubt
[1:26:36] excitement would rise Here Comes father
[1:26:38] we had such a great day in the garden
[1:26:40] now we can tell them all about it now we
[1:26:42] can be in his presence like never before
[1:26:44] and experience him in a greater way and
[1:26:46] and he'll talk to us and he's going to
[1:26:48] speak to our hearts and our hearts is
[1:26:50] burn and we just love it so much when he
[1:26:52] speaks and but this day was different
[1:26:55] why because sin had cometh and the new
[1:26:58] church was gonna they knew the church
[1:27:00] doors were going to open up because God
[1:27:01] always comes to church he's always on
[1:27:03] time and now they begin to feel Panic
[1:27:06] they don't even know what this emotion
[1:27:07] is but now they're panicking we're naked
[1:27:10] we're going to do something about this
[1:27:11] so they've hastily grabbed fig leaves
[1:27:13] try and cover up their nakedness and
[1:27:15] then they and then and then they hear
[1:27:17] the voice of God walking through the
[1:27:19] garden Adam because God stepped into
[1:27:21] church and he was surprised that no one
[1:27:23] was there
[1:27:25] because they had medieval ways in church
[1:27:27] but he walked in the door he goes to see
[1:27:29] where they always sit because everyone
[1:27:30] has their favorite seat
[1:27:32] but those seats were empty that day
[1:27:35] and now God knew exactly what happened
[1:27:37] he wasn't surprised but God always comes
[1:27:39] down to our level to talk to us
[1:27:42] so now now they were now they were you
[1:27:45] know they were all worried and stressed
[1:27:47] because they had to cover their
[1:27:48] nakedness but then now when they heard
[1:27:50] the voice of God that voice that used to
[1:27:52] bring such a joy and a love would sweep
[1:27:54] over them without hear his voice now it
[1:27:56] produced fear
[1:27:58] you think about the first time man ever
[1:28:01] felt fear was because of the presence of
[1:28:03] his maker
[1:28:05] it wasn't because of the devil it wasn't
[1:28:07] because of hell it wasn't because of
[1:28:08] Torment it was because of the God who
[1:28:11] made them came into their presence
[1:28:13] and this is why they are afraid the very
[1:28:16] one you know you know all God wants to
[1:28:18] do is pick us up
[1:28:19] tell us he loves us tell us he cares
[1:28:22] about us you know he doesn't want to
[1:28:23] kick us down some hole somewhere he's
[1:28:25] not ashamed of any of us
[1:28:27] doesn't matter what state we think we're
[1:28:29] in or what we're in he just wants to
[1:28:31] pick us up say child I love you child
[1:28:34] you're mine I care about you I've been
[1:28:36] longing looking for you just come up
[1:28:38] here tell me all about it I'll make it
[1:28:41] right he's already actually made it
[1:28:42] right by the blood the amen of Jesus
[1:28:44] Christ
[1:28:46] but they hid themselves from the
[1:28:48] presence of the Lord God
[1:28:51] and he says and Adam
[1:28:53] would say I heard thy voice in the
[1:28:55] garden and I was afraid
[1:28:58] he felt Fair because of the voice of God
[1:29:01] but God doesn't want us to be afraid
[1:29:04] see but fear will make us hide things
[1:29:06] yeah yeah they were still Believers in
[1:29:08] God they were still Believers of the
[1:29:09] message Believers of the hour if I can
[1:29:11] put it that way but because fear had
[1:29:13] gripped them they didn't want to be in
[1:29:15] his presence
[1:29:17] we should always love to be in the
[1:29:19] prince of God remember it was God
[1:29:20] running after Adam not Adam running
[1:29:22] after God when he fell
[1:29:24] and so God still seeks seeking us out we
[1:29:27] may look the part we may sing the part
[1:29:29] we may play the part but what's going on
[1:29:31] on the inside
[1:29:32] God wants to deal with the Inside Man
[1:29:37] Hallelujah
[1:29:40] amen but you see there's many fears
[1:29:42] we'll come back something else now I
[1:29:44] don't know if you can read that
[1:29:45] there's a fear of failure people are
[1:29:47] afraid to fail everything's got to be
[1:29:49] perfect
[1:29:51] it's got a their life has to be perfect
[1:29:52] their house has always got to be clean
[1:29:54] the garden's always got to be done their
[1:29:55] car's always got to be clean they've
[1:29:57] always got to have the best clothes you
[1:29:59] know they can't look like they they are
[1:30:01] afraid of someone sees them that they
[1:30:03] don't have it all together and they're
[1:30:04] living under fear
[1:30:07] well I'm just a perfectionist don't let
[1:30:09] it be a fear
[1:30:10] don't let it be actually Fair motivating
[1:30:12] your life
[1:30:13] amen there's a fear of what others say
[1:30:15] about them now peer pressure is a real
[1:30:17] demon
[1:30:18] that is a real demon especially in the
[1:30:20] teenage years even in the 20s you know
[1:30:22] because you haven't found who you really
[1:30:24] are yet peer pressure is a demon
[1:30:27] it is not of God it never was of God
[1:30:30] never will it's it's a demon Spirit
[1:30:32] trying to get you to be like everyone
[1:30:33] else
[1:30:35] we should but then even people on the on
[1:30:38] the mess on the religious side people
[1:30:40] are afraid what will others say about
[1:30:42] them if if I don't have it all together
[1:30:44] what will they say if my kids are
[1:30:46] actually being children
[1:30:49] we don't want robots
[1:30:52] we want kids you hear what brother Brown
[1:30:53] says about Joseph and his you know he's
[1:30:55] a real boy doing all these things and
[1:30:57] the girls were real girls you know they
[1:30:59] weren't robots
[1:31:00] why do we but but but we can get under a
[1:31:03] fear of what others will say about us
[1:31:05] and you know how our family is doing hey
[1:31:09] sometimes brother bam says we'll go
[1:31:10] through seasons
[1:31:12] sometimes the family's going real good
[1:31:14] it's the summer time but sometimes
[1:31:15] there's trouble after trouble it's a
[1:31:16] night season there comes into a day
[1:31:18] season again see we all go through
[1:31:20] Seasons but we shouldn't be living under
[1:31:22] fear of what people will think about us
[1:31:23] and our families
[1:31:25] hey we're human man we need the grace of
[1:31:27] God we don't have it all together I have
[1:31:30] I don't have it all together
[1:31:33] praise God is that all right to say you
[1:31:36] know we're going to realize we don't
[1:31:38] have it all together but he always has
[1:31:39] it all together and he's the one we're
[1:31:41] depending upon
[1:31:42] people have a fear of a loss of
[1:31:44] reputation
[1:31:45] oh my you know because they've got to
[1:31:47] have an image they've got to project but
[1:31:48] it's actually this doing it out of fear
[1:31:50] fear of being made fun of this causes
[1:31:53] people to shrink within themselves they
[1:31:55] don't want to step they don't want to be
[1:31:56] themselves you know it's amazing
[1:31:57] especially when I was growing up and I
[1:31:59] think it's still the same people want to
[1:32:01] dress different to be unique because
[1:32:03] everyone does it and they actually have
[1:32:04] the same style they end up looking all
[1:32:06] the same
[1:32:08] I'm gonna set my own fashion trend next
[1:32:11] minute it's everyone and you're the last
[1:32:13] one to actually jump on board but you
[1:32:15] just thought man I'm going to be I'm
[1:32:16] going to be an individual who's he met
[1:32:19] it's every generation Has It by the way
[1:32:23] fear of being made fun of fear of change
[1:32:26] Gideon got used to threshing wheat there
[1:32:28] in secret
[1:32:31] and change Mindy had to step out yeah I
[1:32:33] mean I mean you can even ask the
[1:32:35] question why did an angel need to come
[1:32:36] to him
[1:32:37] and tell them to go do this
[1:32:40] he was a circumcised son of Abraham
[1:32:42] living in the Promised Land
[1:32:43] why did he need an Angelic visitation
[1:32:46] it's because he got used to
[1:32:49] living the way he was
[1:32:51] yet he was a believer
[1:32:53] yet he said well if God is with us
[1:32:55] where's the miracle is a very good way
[1:32:57] brother Graham said about um you know
[1:32:58] very good question to ask but yet he had
[1:33:02] to step out and courage to change his
[1:33:04] situation see God doesn't push us
[1:33:06] through a pipe and make us overcome
[1:33:07] program says that no we have to be
[1:33:10] willing to have courage to actually step
[1:33:12] out and say change my life Lord I'm not
[1:33:15] going to be the same person Lord you've
[1:33:16] got to change me I'm not going to stay
[1:33:18] in the same way
[1:33:19] amen fear of the unknown
[1:33:22] people are scared of the unknown some
[1:33:24] people think yo
[1:33:26] you know a comfort zone
[1:33:28] we know over time gets smaller
[1:33:31] right and the reason most children are
[1:33:33] happier is whether because they're
[1:33:35] always pushed out of their comfort zone
[1:33:37] go play this sport go do this class you
[1:33:39] know you never I mean you know there's
[1:33:42] some years where you choose your
[1:33:43] subjects but pardon me most years you
[1:33:45] you just give us something to learn and
[1:33:46] now we're going to do this and you know
[1:33:48] but you're always pushed out of your
[1:33:49] comfort zone
[1:33:50] but then as you become an adult your
[1:33:53] comfort zone gets less and actually
[1:33:55] people uh they've done studies that find
[1:33:57] that people actually live less fulfilled
[1:33:59] lives because their comfort zones get
[1:34:01] smaller and they're not going out beyond
[1:34:03] their comfort zone yeah and that can be
[1:34:06] a fear
[1:34:07] well I've never done this before I've
[1:34:09] never you know you know imagine a kid uh
[1:34:12] at school how many times a day would
[1:34:13] they say well I've never done this
[1:34:14] before of course you've never done this
[1:34:16] before you're learning you're growing
[1:34:17] but when does the learning and growing
[1:34:19] stop I'm not talking about sitting in a
[1:34:21] class for a whole day for the rest of
[1:34:22] your life but you know there's
[1:34:23] situations in life you say man I've
[1:34:25] never come across this before
[1:34:26] of course you haven't
[1:34:28] praise God it's new but don't drink in
[1:34:30] yourself saying I'm afraid of this
[1:34:32] actually no take it by the take the ball
[1:34:34] by the horns
[1:34:35] I admit anyway
[1:34:37] anyway we'll we'll leave that alone I'll
[1:34:40] be watching when you do it we'll be
[1:34:43] praying too
[1:34:44] good luck
[1:34:46] oh my but you know the fear of
[1:34:48] confessing their wrongs
[1:34:50] because what will people now a lot of
[1:34:52] this feeds into one another but people
[1:34:53] are afraid of actually confessing to God
[1:34:55] that they're wrong
[1:34:57] because that takes us three to that
[1:34:58] takes a you know that takes a
[1:35:00] vulnerability and then there's a fear of
[1:35:02] making their wrongs right well if I
[1:35:04] confess this then I've got to do this
[1:35:05] and this has got to happen and but all
[1:35:07] the guilt will be gone yeah you won't
[1:35:09] have to you'll ever you'll be able to
[1:35:10] sleep at night that's a good trait
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:15] the fear of finding out what's wrong
[1:35:17] with their health
[1:35:19] people are afraid to go to doctors they
[1:35:22] have a pain they say no I'm just
[1:35:24] believing I'm not even going to look for
[1:35:25] it
[1:35:26] but David when he came came against
[1:35:28] Goliath he says who is this
[1:35:30] uncircumcised philistine
[1:35:32] he wanted to know his name
[1:35:34] and say thank God this thing's going
[1:35:36] down
[1:35:38] amen so it should be the same thing with
[1:35:39] you and I if there's something wrong in
[1:35:41] our bodies we shouldn't be afraid to go
[1:35:42] to the doctor
[1:35:43] we say well I don't trust them at least
[1:35:46] they could diagnose what's wrong with
[1:35:47] you so you'll get a name to pray against
[1:35:49] amen but the thing is people say well
[1:35:51] there's a lot of crack doctors these
[1:35:53] days well there's a lot of quack
[1:35:54] homeopaths too
[1:35:56] so you got whatever you do you've got to
[1:35:57] do it in faith you can't be like what yo
[1:36:00] what if God wants to use medicine but
[1:36:02] you're not willing to use it
[1:36:03] yeah and God because but God wants you
[1:36:05] to actually actually trust him because
[1:36:08] we can't put God In The Box we can't
[1:36:11] come to God with our preconceived ideas
[1:36:12] and call it faith you know because some
[1:36:15] people and they're not in this room
[1:36:16] again
[1:36:17] people have shared health conditions and
[1:36:20] they lay on their bed afraid of what it
[1:36:22] could be and the devil tells them you're
[1:36:23] gonna die
[1:36:24] and they live in fear but they won't go
[1:36:26] to the doctor to get a name
[1:36:29] that's not faith I said but they're
[1:36:30] believing God and they're gonna again
[1:36:32] they're not in this room okay that's not
[1:36:34] Faith that's fear we should not be
[1:36:36] afraid
[1:36:38] if I woke up tomorrow morning as I'm
[1:36:40] crippling pain I'm gonna go find out
[1:36:41] what it is
[1:36:44] is that okay
[1:36:45] I'm not a you know I'm not a
[1:36:47] hypochondriac I've had our Medical
[1:36:49] Center contact me saying do you still
[1:36:51] want to be on the records you haven't
[1:36:52] come in enough
[1:36:54] I'm not that sick but if I'm sick I'm
[1:36:57] you know I'm really gonna go are we
[1:36:59] together
[1:37:00] right but people get afraid of what
[1:37:02] could it be the devil says well it's
[1:37:04] it's cancer it may be but brother Ram
[1:37:07] says real overcoming is recognizing your
[1:37:10] enemy and knowing the one in you has
[1:37:12] already overcome it that's real
[1:37:13] overcoming says that's perfectly
[1:37:15] sensible right so we should never bury
[1:37:18] our head in the sand if something's
[1:37:20] going wrong what's its name good now
[1:37:23] I've got a name now we pray
[1:37:26] your duty to go to the doctors
[1:37:29] you gotta have faith in what you're
[1:37:30] doing we don't have fear we don't live
[1:37:33] out of fear eh right
[1:37:35] well this could happen this conspiracy
[1:37:36] this guy hey the whole world is
[1:37:38] controlled by the devil
[1:37:40] the Bible says so
[1:37:42] yeah I'm sorry that's just how it is but
[1:37:44] God is greater than him
[1:37:46] right and if the devil could have
[1:37:48] destroyed us he would have done it a
[1:37:50] long time ago and if we go when God or
[1:37:52] dangers to go then that's our time to go
[1:37:54] that's right nothing can take us to our
[1:37:57] purpose and on the earth is done
[1:38:00] praise God
[1:38:02] don't think I'm blase about these things
[1:38:04] I'm not not being blase but where's your
[1:38:07] faith or is it fear see fear can be
[1:38:11] veiled in a in a very Christian way oh
[1:38:14] I'm praying about it but they're not
[1:38:15] doing anything about it they're not
[1:38:17] putting their faith into action not
[1:38:18] letting their footsteps be ordered
[1:38:20] because remember the footsteps of the
[1:38:21] righteous are ordered of the Lord but
[1:38:23] they cannot be ordered unless you're
[1:38:25] moving
[1:38:26] see fear of failure but what if I'm not
[1:38:28] doing the perfect will of God God will
[1:38:30] bring you unto his perfect will amen
[1:38:31] amen right but you can't if you're
[1:38:33] standing there growing moss and you're
[1:38:34] growing tree roots because you're not
[1:38:35] moving God can't direct those steps
[1:38:37] right but if your heart is off saying
[1:38:39] Lord remember brother Brown me he was he
[1:38:41] was lost on Hurricane Mountain you know
[1:38:43] his wife his child was there in the in
[1:38:46] the lean to whatever there's a storm
[1:38:47] coming through and he prayed sincerely
[1:38:49] he says I believe it's this way
[1:38:52] and then he was walking that way he fell
[1:38:53] the head on her shoulder he turned
[1:38:55] around there's a gap in the Gap in the
[1:38:56] storm he saw he was going the wrong way
[1:38:59] but he was still walking
[1:39:01] what if he said well I'm just going to
[1:39:02] stand here
[1:39:04] that would have been the end of it
[1:39:06] see you've got to be just sincerely seek
[1:39:09] the Lord and walk and if God says no
[1:39:12] turn this way you turn
[1:39:15] praise God
[1:39:17] don't ever fear a failure
[1:39:22] amen but you see now we need courage in
[1:39:24] this day
[1:39:27] courage is a so Webster says courage is
[1:39:30] a mental or moral strength I hope yeah
[1:39:32] I'll wrap this up soon to venture
[1:39:35] persevere and withstand danger fear or
[1:39:37] difficulty that's what courage takes see
[1:39:40] it's very easy to be like if you're in a
[1:39:42] battlefield to be hid in a trench or a
[1:39:43] foxhole it's easy to be there still
[1:39:46] dangerous but it's easy but it's those
[1:39:47] that go over the top
[1:39:49] and attack their enemy that takes
[1:39:51] courage that takes a courage to be
[1:39:53] exposed to enemy fire
[1:39:55] right but see we've got to have courage
[1:39:58] in this day like never before because
[1:39:59] man's hearts are failing for fear
[1:40:02] I mean so now it's interesting with
[1:40:04] Joshua Joshua we know was ordained to
[1:40:06] take the children of Israel and place
[1:40:07] them in the land now I just you know
[1:40:10] I'll just very quickly looking last
[1:40:12] night God never told Moses to be to have
[1:40:15] good courage
[1:40:17] but then when Joshua comes on the scene
[1:40:19] God would tell him
[1:40:21] three times to be strong and be and be
[1:40:25] of a good courage or be thou strong and
[1:40:27] be very courageous why because you're
[1:40:29] going to need courage Joshua you're
[1:40:31] going to come into things that you've
[1:40:32] never experienced before you're going to
[1:40:34] come against enemies you've never seen
[1:40:36] before apart from when you spied out the
[1:40:37] land you need courage you need courage
[1:40:40] when things happen among the children of
[1:40:41] Israel that can you stand on my word or
[1:40:44] will you compromise and fail see we need
[1:40:46] courage in this day amen to stand and
[1:40:49] take God in his word
[1:40:50] amen don't be says Don't Be Afraid
[1:40:53] neither be thou dismayed now this word
[1:40:55] dismay it means it means to properly to
[1:40:58] prostrate so that means to bow down to
[1:41:01] break down or figuratively to be brought
[1:41:03] down by confusion or fear see we
[1:41:06] shouldn't be dismayed when something
[1:41:08] happens then we actually bow ourselves
[1:41:09] before that thing we're not here to
[1:41:11] prostrate ourselves before fear or even
[1:41:14] any demon complex or whatever it is
[1:41:17] we're here to prostrate ourselves before
[1:41:19] the Living God then God will mold us
[1:41:22] into his very image see people who are
[1:41:24] fearful embody that fear they manifest
[1:41:27] that fear they speak negative something
[1:41:29] comes up it's just bad bad sad gloomy
[1:41:32] trouble that's fear right but people who
[1:41:34] actually have faith they say no this may
[1:41:36] all be so but yet God rich and mercy
[1:41:39] will take care of me in this situation
[1:41:40] you see Caleb and Joshua saw the same
[1:41:43] Giants at the other ten spies saw but
[1:41:46] they say let's go take it right now
[1:41:48] yep it's there they agreed both all 12
[1:41:51] agreed until what but but on one point
[1:41:54] they disagreed the 10 said we can't do
[1:41:56] it the two said we can take it because
[1:41:58] God's given it right so that was courage
[1:42:00] that was Faith the other ones were
[1:42:02] living under fear we're grasshoppers in
[1:42:03] their sight they never ask that question
[1:42:05] they never handed out a survey they
[1:42:07] didn't go door to door and you know what
[1:42:09] do you think of us but they just kind of
[1:42:11] made that idea and said well man we're
[1:42:13] just grasshoppers grasshoppers by the
[1:42:15] way eat up the land
[1:42:17] they moving they chew up everything yeah
[1:42:22] they were ordained to take it but yet
[1:42:24] fear gripped those 10 spice
[1:42:26] and they begin to prostrate themselves
[1:42:29] before that fear we can't do it yet they
[1:42:31] are believers they are in the message of
[1:42:33] the hour they are in church but they
[1:42:35] were Fair gripped them that they
[1:42:37] couldn't take the next step
[1:42:41] we should be very willing
[1:42:43] to take every step
[1:42:48] we have a fear
[1:42:49] of not being perfect
[1:42:52] fear of consequences
[1:42:54] every action has a reaction
[1:42:59] fear of leaving their old life behind
[1:43:01] you got to burn that thing up you can't
[1:43:04] speak of your old life and pride
[1:43:07] if you are proud or think anything good
[1:43:09] of your own life you're still attached
[1:43:10] to that thing and it'll drag you back
[1:43:12] but if you see it for what it is like
[1:43:14] the Apostle Paul said I can all things
[1:43:15] but don't that I may win Christ is
[1:43:18] another Pharisee of the Pharisees he
[1:43:19] could have thought man there were
[1:43:20] Banquets in my honor their award
[1:43:22] ceremonies in my honor my pleasure at
[1:43:24] school had all the badges on it you know
[1:43:26] I had all the degrees on my wall you
[1:43:28] know he could say man I I haven't talked
[1:43:30] Amelia a thing or two I asked him some
[1:43:32] questions I never thought of that before
[1:43:33] and wow no he counted all but done
[1:43:35] hey and that's what we're going to be
[1:43:37] willing to do amen but people are afraid
[1:43:40] because why your identity's got to
[1:43:42] change the Rich Young Ruler was afraid
[1:43:43] to leave his old life behind
[1:43:46] and
[1:43:48] he went back to their old life
[1:43:50] people are afraid of the new birth
[1:43:53] brother Bram said even Bradham
[1:43:54] Tabernacle is getting afraid of being
[1:43:55] born again
[1:43:57] that's the thing we need
[1:43:59] we need a new birth we need a baptism
[1:44:01] after baptism we need God to come down
[1:44:03] and take over our services to change our
[1:44:05] hearts you know many things see the
[1:44:07] reason the reason we get stuck in sin is
[1:44:09] because of sin nature no matter how much
[1:44:11] we want to do better that's the Nature's
[1:44:13] got to be burnt out of us amen he's got
[1:44:15] to change the desires in our life amen
[1:44:17] it's not turning over a new Leaf God's
[1:44:19] going to change our desires amen we're
[1:44:21] going to be born again amen but there's
[1:44:22] a fear of not being in control
[1:44:26] what if I shout what if I run the aisle
[1:44:29] what if I speak in tongues
[1:44:31] you have to be willing to do those
[1:44:33] things you may not do any of those
[1:44:34] things but you could get to a place
[1:44:36] where you don't care no more like well I
[1:44:38] can't remember what we're listening to
[1:44:39] but your brother man tells that story of
[1:44:41] that of that colored brother there in um
[1:44:43] in in America and his boss already so
[1:44:46] happy all the time
[1:44:48] they said well what happened he says
[1:44:50] well I got old-time religion you know
[1:44:52] and then one day his boss says I want to
[1:44:54] get it so they go to a nice big Hayloft
[1:44:56] and then and then but but then the
[1:44:58] brother who had the you know really had
[1:45:00] the Holy Ghost said you don't get it
[1:45:01] here then they go to a meadow you don't
[1:45:03] get it here they go to some place you
[1:45:05] don't get it here he says well where do
[1:45:06] you get it then he rolls up his trouser
[1:45:08] legs walks out into a pig pen kneels
[1:45:11] down but the boss doesn't go in
[1:45:13] and then he looks up says and you're
[1:45:14] coming in he says no I'm not going there
[1:45:16] he says well you're not ready to get it
[1:45:17] yet
[1:45:18] see you have to be willing
[1:45:21] praise God you ought to be willing
[1:45:23] wherever you know see see people are so
[1:45:26] afraid to let the Holy Ghost take
[1:45:27] control of their lives because of well
[1:45:29] what will this person think it'd be well
[1:45:31] if they're actually Spirit-filled
[1:45:33] they'll they'll celebrate with you amen
[1:45:35] they'll they'll Rejoice with you and you
[1:45:37] never know what what God does in your
[1:45:39] life may just spread to everyone and a
[1:45:41] Revival might break out just because of
[1:45:43] you letting God use you you know the
[1:45:45] Welsh Revival really started because a
[1:45:47] young sister got up and said Lord be
[1:45:48] glorified in me
[1:45:51] and it's back to Revival of a hundred
[1:45:53] thousand people came to Christ
[1:45:54] because of one young sister got up and
[1:45:56] said that in a meeting
[1:45:59] amen what if she didn't do it
[1:46:02] but she did
[1:46:04] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:46:07] see so we should not be afraid of what
[1:46:10] what people will say
[1:46:12] who cares
[1:46:13] they can have their opinions second
[1:46:15] opinions is quite a big book I don't
[1:46:16] read it
[1:46:19] delete
[1:46:21] oh block
[1:46:24] you know
[1:46:25] but you see we should not be afraid of
[1:46:27] those things we should let God be God
[1:46:30] amen
[1:46:31] we should let God be God now see how
[1:46:34] many ministers could God use this
[1:46:35] morning if that only that God bind them
[1:46:37] with his word and with his power now
[1:46:39] what about you and I because all of
[1:46:40] these kind of quotes when I read them I
[1:46:42] never actually put them out there I
[1:46:43] always bring it in here
[1:46:45] you know what if God would bind us with
[1:46:46] his word and his power what could happen
[1:46:49] What could happen in our lives what
[1:46:51] could God do he can do the unlimited he

[1:50:34] up he said I've been wandering for years
[1:50:36] you know doing nothing for God not even
[1:50:38] living for him just say Lord here I am
[1:50:41] I'm done you know there's a uh you know
[1:50:44] a book we uh um I read to the kids ages
[1:50:46] ago a Tanglewood secrets and I think I
[1:50:48] see it in Wales or Scotland somewhere
[1:50:50] and that's where they use gorse actually
[1:50:52] or hedges for fences and doesn't grow
[1:50:54] like it does here it actually stays
[1:50:56] where it should be and um
[1:50:58] and and the um like I remember saying it
[1:51:01] but they said you know lambs and things
[1:51:02] they get you know you know they start
[1:51:05] eating grass near the hedges and then
[1:51:07] their wool gets caught in the gorse or
[1:51:09] the Hedge and they can't pull themselves
[1:51:10] free
[1:51:11] but they only they only are found by the
[1:51:14] shepherd when they start calling out
[1:51:16] because they can be stuck in a hedge
[1:51:18] somewhere you can't even see them with a
[1:51:19] naked eye interface
[1:51:21] you know stand there and they're
[1:51:22] wrestling and they're pulling saying
[1:51:24] well I can do this and I'll be okay and
[1:51:25] I can manage this sin and this is not so
[1:51:27] bad and you know I can look here and
[1:51:29] this is just how I'm meant to be
[1:51:30] the shepherd can't find them but if they
[1:51:33] just begin to call one time because the
[1:51:35] ship is looking he's got a certain
[1:51:37] number of sheep and if one's missing
[1:51:39] he's not happy with well fifty percent
[1:51:41] of passing grade not without Jesus 100
[1:51:44] he wants he wants us all home right but
[1:51:47] it's only when so so the shipper can be
[1:51:49] wandering up and down paddocks trying to
[1:51:51] look along hedgerows but it's when the
[1:51:52] Sheep begins to bleat yeah but why does
[1:51:55] the Sheep stop bleeding because it stops
[1:51:57] fighting it stops trying to free itself
[1:51:59] it stops trying to fix its own situation
[1:52:01] because it realizes it can't and the
[1:52:04] sooner we get to that predicament we
[1:52:06] realize we can't help ourselves we can't
[1:52:08] free ourselves we're just making matters
[1:52:11] worse then we can start to call out the
[1:52:13] father God and he'll reach down his
[1:52:15] hands and pull us up out of that hitra
[1:52:16] and say I've been looking for you
[1:52:18] Hallelujah
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:22] so just get all this fear out of our
