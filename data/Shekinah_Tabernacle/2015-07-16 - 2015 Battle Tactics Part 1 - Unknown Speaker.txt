please me grant it bothers commit this time into your hands and just anoint speaker in here I pray one more time please grind it father in Jesus Christ they may ask these things amen amen so a few if you've got your Bibles handy I'd like to read a couple of portions of scripture if we'll go to I'd like to read from the book of Ephesians and chapter 6 and then we're going to go to first Corinthians chapter 14 we're going to read a portion of Scripture there like to tonight I'd like to begin a thought on battle tactics I want to speak on battle tactics and I want to go if I I won't finish it now but i'll pick it up some other time maybe on Sunday but I just that's that's really where I want to go you know battle plans battle tactics are in a battle and so let's just read some scripture here let's read so Ephesians 6 from verse 10 and I trust this is all familiar with you it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for a wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this evil world against spiritual wickedness in high places and we read that verse 13 as well wherefore take unto you the whole lot of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand and then we'll go to first Corinthians chapter 14 so it's amazing we've got where Paul has revealed things to the ephesian church he hasn't revealed to any other Church how they've been there have been quickened you know how they've been passing death unto life God's mercy has saved them then up there there be sealed into the kingdom and all these things but yet he says now now brethren put on the whole armor of God and now we're go to battle we're going to push the front the battlefronts got to go out and where to meet the enemy in these things so you know it's a yeah it's an incredible thing and it's all read first Corinthians 14 and verse 8 yes as a context it's his proof the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle I mean may the Lord bless us would you may you be seated I want to speak I want to begin I don't know how this is going to go but I want to speak about battle tactics now it is there's three things as we read there in first Corinthians 14 it says if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle it and we read there in Ephesians that we have been armored we've been equipped for this battle against against the enemy and when we find an unseen enemy but in any battle there's three things you must know before you go into battle you must know what your battlefield us you must know you better fill the layout of the trainer all these things you must know your enemy his tactics and his weapons and then you must know about you and your tactics and your weapons if you don't know you're you know if you don't know any of those three things you're going to lose you to get beaten but if you know all those three things then you can prepare your forces you can train your men a certain way you can be prepared to meet and brother branham he speaks in the contest he speaks about when he was a you know wit yo when he was a boxer and he uses this is just now I know there's an old saying that people are an old saying that's not solely the people don't believe in demons in this day but the thing to do to my opinion is know your enemy and know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to meet him and know him no no what his strength 'as and then trained for this contest when you do meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him and so you trained for the contest now training for a contest is just like a boxer his enemy he's going to meet out there in a contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his licks knows where he fights for whether he leans forward on backwards hangs back fights right-handed or left-handed he studies all of us and then if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that will fight just like his opponent fights for he'll know all of his licks when he it's that place and I think that's a very good thing for a Christians to do that's right and now if you want to start training start with john three sixteen the golden rule which is for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son start right out with that and that'll get you on the floor and then train for the knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everyone knows that you've got to train to hit your enemy and always God uses his word we must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy if God would think or could have give us people anything better defeat the enemy with he would have done so as I always said when God makes a decision that's the best that there is he never has to alter his decisions so the first decision God gave his people the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his worth they will fortified with his word now so we must understand Sosa brother I'm saying on danse in town in terms we must we must train we must study our enemy we must observe how it works and we must adjust ourselves and and be trained then whenever he uses as tactics we can combat as tactics and combat as weapons because if we don't study our enemy something can suddenly blindside us and it can just be the devil giving a testing blow to see you know because when you box you don't normally just go for the knockout punch when you begin with you begin to test test your opponent stem and I've know I've only ever watch boxing I'll do a box of my life but you see they you know i guess i'm testing jabs and they test the enemy see how fast they are on their feet and how fast they can move their weight and all these things and they're every bidding could you because it's one thing to train but i think when you're in the regular and it's really happening and the devil many times he just he just gives a test punch to see and sometimes yeah and if you're not prepared for a punch it will floor you and so many things Christians can be blindsided by something it's only a test page of the devil and their whole life has turned upside down and they say how did the come to this what why is that because I haven't studied their opponent so we need to study our opponent yeah now our brother Graham says so and then but the first thing is we must know what our battlefields us and since we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities spirits and things in high places we do not this is not a physical war we don't have to physically train an army and you know the other brand tells us and we can see it yo in the scripture that the battlefield is a human mind that is the mutual mutual meeting ground because a battleground is like World War one there's no man's land and you're reading especially in the Old Testament where we are where armies would fight that have a mutual ground where they would set up their troops on either side and and normally it's not given initially just and all that assault but you test the weaknesses of of your enemy and how they set up and you test their skill and their strength to see that's like Goliath he went out there and gave us challenge and the Philistines are on this side and the Israel was on the other side there was that mutual meeting place in the middle so you must know you must know your your battlefield and you must know the conditions of your battlefield you know many many armies have made mistakes because they've used the wrong weapon in the wrong place because it's not suitable for the battlefield you take you take some of the English victories when they had long boys back in the day buddy battlefield the French had their heavily armored horses they just got bogged down in the battlefield and they and an English one why cuz the French didn't didn't see what their battle food that what was the terrain you know and and because they didn't use the right weapon in the right place they lost your iron others is very may be very elementary but I trust I trust you it makes sense maybe if you don't know if you don't know the condition of your battle food you saw just a human mind well what makes up the human mind right right you know if you don't know what makes up the human mind it once again the devil just blindside you with a punch and then you think you're being led by god and you're being led by your feelings some some memory or something that's not according to the word and you're defeated and you just being dragged along the ground as a piece of spoil of war she must know what you battlefield us now brother Bram said here he said this this isn't the greatest battle ever fought he says now before any battle can be put in a raid they first have to choose a meeting ground or a place with the battles to be fought a selected place it is in the First World War it was so placed in no man's land and places where they fought and they've got to be a place selected like when Israel way toward the Philistines a hill on each side were they gathered and as we glide would come out call to the armies of Israel that's where David meet him in the valley when he pressed over the little creeks that run between the two hills he picked up the rocks there has to be a place selected a mutual ground and no man's land there's what brother brams tell him this he's saying this is what your mind is this is what the stopped 22 inches is he's actually calling it no man's land it's calling this no man's land oh it's my mind I'm thinking no it's no man's land yes it's no man it's a mutual ground what does no man's land neither power it doesn't belong to either power try mine think about it good you just I wish I had some photos of some no man's land from from world war one and two it's just mud nothing living as when the enemies come along because the devil has plan is to destroy kill maim just tear down whatever God is built right and some people's minds you go Google the song or you know one of Passchendaele or one of the great battlefields of World War one mud dead bodies trenches not a single living thing and that's what people's minds that's what people's minds look like out there in the world that's right it's just carnage yeah you like it or not that told us and we're not exempt from it now there's a place he says there's a battle front where they meet and test their powers where each army tests its strength against the other army a mutual meeting place that he says now don't miss this now when he says don't message it means means pay attention when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place they had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the bell to reach and that battle ground begins in the human mind that is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical affair the ground never started there there for the organization can never never do the work of God because the battle grounds where you've only got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you I want this little girl whether it's very sick to be sure to lose with us now real closely decisions are made in the mind at the head that is where say can meet you and the decisions are because that god made man that way so God actually made you that this is no man's land God built you so this is no man's land and everyone thinks they can just do it their way now who are you does this land you know it's like pobres progress they came to a certain way and they they begin to walk along Emanuel's ground and Beulah land and the omega bjorlin but-but-but Emmanuel's ground that's God's ground as a scott brown or as a muddy metal field where it's just death and just mud churned up by just thinking dead dead things everywhere or is this actually God's ground where God is actually places you know because of a phenom ii takes a no man's land it becomes their position and the no man's land is pushed out when they make their advance so what is this life is it God's as its agents or was it just a big churning battlefield now he says this in 2nd Corinthians 10 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal just Leslie but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations imaginations part of the mind route and everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ because remember your mind is more than just that's your imagination conscious reasoning of fiction conscience that's your mind so if those blah are those are subject to the word of god c he says you're going to bring every thought subject to the Word of God and if it's not brought subject then the devil can come in because because one person asked brother Branham how do I know i'm thinking God's thoughts he says God's thoughts of the word yeah if your thoughts on anything if your thoughts are contrary to the scripture get rid of those thoughts and don't pay attention to those sorts don't feel condemned that you think them because at the end of the day this is no man's land and it's just a devil testing strength he puts the thought in your mind or something comes on way he's just testing strength he's doing a pro as he week here's he went there that's right as she week here week there right yep NFU if you actually lay hold of that thought and begin to ponder upon that thought what's happening the devil's digging trenches and he's putting in sandbags and machine-gun emplacements and then more to things and some heavily art I you know artillery he's he's fortifying up yeah that's really the strongholds that we're called the pull down in here yeah and then paul also says do not give place to the devil what does that mean give place you retreat you give ground drunken ground to Satan push forward Amy I mean how do you do that take order this would right no devil may try and hang around for a while resist the devil and he shall flee glory he didn't say how quickly he's gonna flee be going to resist them hey Betty resistance like a scrub and rugby right if ever the defensive scrub hey they're resisting yep no you take some little spine let your little small team against some big islands a team or something those Ford's know they're going to be pushed over by that big island theme of Theodore careful yeah actually I actually have to resist the scrum you got to actually put some forces to resist yeah man that's not just roll over and die because you're soft a man thank God it is work he said well he's not retreating just keep swinging that word of them I'm not feeling for a good buyer stripes I'm here yes my swords not very sharp supply bit more force it'll still cut his head off eventually menu preset menu is gonna just keep swinging hello just tell you any word you say yeah because the devil will tell you that's not doing any good that's right but it is doing good he just doesn't want you to know you know why the British were called redcoats you know why they're wore red coats exactly so so when they got wounded the people couldn't see the blood so here's your commander whatever they did going into battle covered in a red coat now if he dies or gets wounded inners it as men will will begin to falter but if they can't see the blood he just he just says charge on boys they'll take cars no charge on it's like the devil he doesn't want you to realize that he's wounded that the word is actually passing and chopping him so you just got up yes you just have to take this word you so don't know the whole Bible used in one scripture you when when the devil came against Jesus Jesus just selected from a whole arsenal we just picked one he just picked one bullet hood unless got any fire glory man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Moses work that would be me you shall not tempt the LORD thy God he just took he just took one thing and this was his big this was the big contest because the devil came against Moses Moses felt the devil came here Saul the prophets they felt came to give David a sinner and and safe intent to David this is when he's on the throne he's kicking everything and he felt so you're the devil's probing at people here to go with Jesus and Jesus just took the word just just one phrase you just took one phrase and you use it and it defeated Satan amen hallelujah meal so you know we have to we have to identify this is a battlefield there's no man's land but Roy but what are you doing with it you know if people are afraid you look at you look at you look at warfare real warfare that is victorious is not defensive No the whole armies army study how they can get inside the thought pattern will command structure of different armies and if they can actually break up actually get inside their plantings actually they plan things before the enemy can react to it then they have that enemy that's how Americans that's how although military's in the army I mean you're in the world they plan and they have their intelligence they know how the enemy's command structure works and they actually can identify what the enemy is going to do and they get with inside their commands into how how they think yeah because if you can get there before the enemy gets there you've got them if you're one step ahead so if you're always advancing you're one step ahead that's how the I know it's probably a lot of examples but that's thee you know they got a bunch of South Africans ins and Bob lands that were mercenaries from from South Africa they took them up to Nigeria and they drove out that a Muslim fanatical group there and how they did it as they were just always advancing once they engage in the battle they just continuously were advancing until they drove them out until they captured their headquarters that's how they did it so they didn't just fight a battle now rested and fighter bell now rest which is a constant rotation of forces and the enemy could build a fort yo they couldn't build a defensive line to hold the enemy back and now driven out yummy men may be right don't build the defensive line we're fortified behind the wood but our defenses move with us hey Laurie he's going to take God at His Word yes sir now so the the battlefield is the mind now I want to go into I want to maybe kind of do a bit of an overview we have our our battlefield intelligences prophecy because if you know all the enemy is going to do then you can combat what he's going to do and you can see what he's going to do just like the great thing when they when they crack the Enigma code and the second world war against the Nazis and when the Americans they they crack the Japanese code so when they see an intelligence coded messages to their different places they they would intercept those messages they knew what the enemy was doing yeah now we have we have in the scripture God just hasn't revealed himself in the scripture but he's fully exposed Satan what he's doing and so if we can see what Satan is doing then we can we can prepare ourselves member because we've got a training area to me that's right and if we can see what the enemy is going to do we can train ourselves that when he does what he says he's going to do we can defeat him amen but if we trained for the wrong kind of battle you know you just know she's going to be a big failure like what is the point of of training some troops to find in the Arctic when you send them to the jungles yeah what is the point of training for a battle that was like an azusa street or in Luther's day at the devil's advanced to hear what is the point yeah see you're just going to be whipped by the enemy right so we have to identify what Satan is doing and then if we identify that then we can combat so we're just going to read some scriptures if you'd like to turn 22 Isaiah chapter 14 and then I'm just going to read a couple more then I'm going to then we're going to go to Genesis now this is more just an overview kind of evening here so Isaiah 14 and brother Brown says just you're just as you're turning their brother Gramps is in the second seal he says now you see Satan raises those up what's the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about here Satan where we're unfolding him right here we're stripping them down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is and what's what is supposed to be done so we've actually saying now we just need just the devil is the most exposed big amen upon this earth it can't hide he can't hide from the Word of God right you can't hide an ecard I'd either and he works cloak and dagger he doesn't want to be seen but this message that we have received at the same time just exposes heads right and it works not just in an international level with down and turn enter your address and we're going to go down into that burst want to show you this here Isaiah 14 verses 12 to 2 16 I trust this is familiar to you he says how thou art fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how they were cut down to the ground with Dennis week in the nation's for thou has seen in thine heart now the heart of Satan's being exposed the officer divine heart all ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High see saying I will be worshipped as God yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that CD an early look upon the in consider these saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that does take the kingdoms and made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of as prisoners so Isaiah God is showing Isaiah this is this is Satan's motive he says I'm going to be God so let's also turn to 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 now remember this is prophecy what Isaiah is seeing is prophecy of future events and we can actually see that they are actually coming into manifestation in this very present day that we live in so now sick of this loading is to and will read from verses 1 to 6 it says here for yourselves brethren wait no I humming first so I'm a first this'll only think of this load ends now we've receipt you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind nor be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day the Lord is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there be come a falling away first and we've seen that falling away and that this man of sin be revealed the son of perdition and he's been revealed who oppose us and exalted himself above all that is called called God or that is work or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember he not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way now this is paul is saying it hasn't happened yet you know but it shall happen yeah he says this that the day of the Lord it says that they have crisis it had he says let no man deceive you by any means that they shall not come except there come a falling away first and then the Madison be revealed being worshipped as God and we have the state of the Scriptures fulfilled so when so when Paul was looking into the he was looking 2,000 years down the road and he was seeing just a few verses but it's taken Satan two thousand years to go from just a mystery of iniquity working until full-blown now the whole world worships Satan and so this is if this is his as I said prophecy is intelligence battlefield intelligence and we've just rid of you this is this is Satan's intent now as i'm going to i want to be gone and i want to be worshipped now if that is if that is his plan then now what are his tactics to do that and inside eggs also read will just read one more revelations three we just read one more this because this is prophecy as well and it speaks for our day and i'll go into these things lord willing in a greater detail but i just want to show you that if this is this is Satan's plan then we should actually see it if we go through a history which actually see it unfolding itself that's like DJ DJ started with an idea they had a at a top-secret meeting we need to invade France America's during the war you know now we can actually take the battle back to Hitler back into the mainland and it started just with a plan a secret plan and then they gathered the men they did the training that built the barges they built the ship site had the supply chain intervention it was they were on Normandy Beach yeah but it all started just with a few million an idea and this profits the same thing it's just it's just a few words saying this is what Satan is going to do but now we can see it's gone beyond that already now so revelations three and verses 14 to 22 now this is this is speaking of LH as his answer and unto the Angel of the Church of the Lady of cns write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that their work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold or hot old speedy out of my mouth because they'll see us I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and now it's not that thou art wretched am Israel poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy Oh me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and at the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I sell that they may see as many as I love i rebuke and chasten be jealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sit down with my father and his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches so this is prophecy when when John sees us he's seen two thousand years down the road and he's saying that Jesus is kicked out of of of the church world this is where he says I standard or not that's because Jesus has been kicked out of his own as I'm church yeah the church world has has kicked them out now so this is prophecy speaking of today and since Satan wants to be worshipped as God then he has to dethrone or dispose the one who's being worshipped and place himself because the devil currently pervert things so he has to get rid of God who was the word and then place himself there yeah that's right so now let us go to Genesis chapter 3 and i'm just going to just briefly i want to show you here how how the serpent came against eve is how it comes against an h he comes against the church he comes against the family he comes against an individual ok so these these are these are part of his tactics yep so now we'll go to rip Genesis chapter 3 because remembered Genesis it means it means us everything's in its seed form so what evers plaza de genesis will grow into full maturity down at the end of all things so how how Satan how Satan attacked Eve he'll use the same method all the way down and he'll use this against you kill you he and he wasn't afraid to come against Jesus if they'll be he said you're the Son of God get yourself off the cross perform a miracle all these things he he's praising he has no respect for you right he has no respect for a family for a real dad a real mum a real daughter or son or has no respect for us Genesis 3 and verses will just read verses 1 2 3 we'll just go down to verse 5 actually now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said so we're just going to read this through they're going to break it down yea hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither you should show you touch at least you die and the woman I mean saying the serpent said unto the woman you shall surely not die for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be God's knowing good and evil so this is this is the devil's method this is the devil's method I'm going to break it down now the first thing he does member member this is no man's land this is no man's land so the first thing he did is he appealed to her nning to her mind she he appealed her yea hath God said so now he's going to bring forth a reasoning did God really say that did he really did he really mean this what he said you know their Bible would have been very short those days but he could have held it up is it and that as this really means what it says and then also notice he says he says yay hath God said g.o.d if you go to Genesis 1 when God is making the creation before man comes into the picture as he isn't God created heavens and earth and God said let there be light of God said this but then when man comes into the picture says and the Lord God right now that may not mean a whole bunch but if you go back into the Hebrew that word God they're just God means Elohim the self-existing one so here's the self-existing one but then the Lord God it actually means a self existing one who expresses himself or the self existing one that I just find that actually the definition because it's quite beautiful he says so so the primary primary meaning of the name Lord's this is from Lord God as Jehovah the self-existing one literally he that is who was there for the eternal I am but however from which Jehovah or Yahweh has formed signifies also to become that is to become knowin that's pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation compile combining these meanings of hover we arrive at the meaning of the name Jehovah as the self-existent one who reveals himself so this Lord God is actually the self existing one who reveals himself who is he revealing himself to to his children so it means it means once he was a self existing one but then when he put people upon the earth that he could relate to and he could speak to that he can make himself known to he became the Lord God who reveals himself so he is the one who once was just just the self-existing thing you know just like if this if this pulpit was eternal you could say this is just a self existing thing it doesn't talk to you it doesn't it just exists and exist by itself but then if this pulpit had a mind and a head thoughts that have began to speak to you it would be the self-existing one that that reveals himself so you would have a relationship with this yep so now God is God as places children upon the earth and then he begins to reveal himself make himself known to Adam and Eve say he's change but then when Satan comes along he says he doesn't say yay have the lord god said so it doesn't say he has this god that has revealed himself to you that you have a relationship with as he said this he says yay had the self-existing one that doesn't speak well it's just as he just exists jay has he said so what he's actually doing as he's chained he's he's changing her reasoning one to question the word that was given by God but to to question as this God really this one who makes himself known to you or is he just a distant God so Satan came along and said basically he said God hasn't spoken to you God hasn't made himself known to you God has some distant being someplace that just exists that we just talked about this is what he's doing to eat I'm just breaking it down so he's he's throwing the question out there he's actually questioning Eve's revelation of who God is because she only knows him as this one who reveals himself your brother Graham tells us during the cool of the evening you know God would come down and as great glory and then the head speak to adam and eve and said no children have you enjoyed your day upon the earth have you enjoyed the goodness and all and that's a yes father was a beautiful that we did this and thus it was wonderful but they had a relationship but the serpent the devil is trying to twist Eve's understanding of God and change her revelation of who God is into something that that is not anymore and you could take that he was God the self-existing one in a previous age so what what what what he was doing what the devil always does and brother bear him he he he says it out of the quote on me but he says that they will let you do will let you know what God did a Moses day was perfectly well he'll he know what he didn't know as they was perfectly well he'll let you know what he did in Jesus day was perfectly well but when it comes to the promo scripture of this day all he has to do is take you from what he's doing in this day and then he can basically inject this poison doctrine to that gap because God is the IM he's the present God he's you're fooling his word today yeah that's right all Satan had to do there and and Moses's day was get the people to believe it wasn't the season and they would never have left Egypt even though he did supernatural things all these things if they just got to believe no Moses you're not the delivery this is not the time that would have set their just like we know we mussst i cometh you'll do these things the woman at the well you know the scribes and Pharisees they said no this is not the season had come to us this is not her what's happening the scribes and Pharisees who try to take the people back to a previous age you try to take the back when the season where the law was going to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ had come and the sacrifice daily sacrifice is going to be done away with it's what the serpent didn't hear yay had God said yeah this being who was of a past age but he's unfolded himself more down through me so he'll take you that it will take you back yay the god of Luther and the god of Luther's the real true and living God but we know I'm a bit more today yeah the god of azusa street we believe what happened in azusa we see gifts we see supernatural we believe in these things amen not just talk about it we've experienced that have we not everybody oh I'm not trying to take away because as soon as people say what are you questioning that no God ads on plus here you justify Lou Thursday then he added sanctification in the end of the restoration of the gifts the end of God coming and dwelling in his people he didn't take away from what happened in those four majors he just built up God is a God of addition or subtraction hey so you know but then the devil take you back yay hath God said yay had the god of Irenee acid' and all right and already I said true things but you don't want to Steve just back there you understand what I'm saying if you if you negate what's happened today and go back to a formal thing what's happened evel's taking you back somewhere else even though it's true yea hath God the self-adjusting one year's real the devil doesn't the devil he's smart if he can give you to believe there's no God that he'll tell you that if we can see how these people really believe in Jesus he doesn't say Jesus isn't real it's a yo some other Jesus has he said that's right so now so he would say preacher doesn't God to her that would have no relationship with her he gave her 99 percent truth in one percent error he just changed the scripture just one little but that's all he did he didn't say God never told you that of God never you know Sidney he said yea hath God and it just twisted a little bit and then also he white washed the consequences of going against the word he just white washed it completely so he said you won't die you surely won't die because as soon as the sooner Satan's or as soon as the serpent saw because she said some and i'll just go back to it the woman said for God doth know that in the day eater of then there are also and the serpent said no oh yes verse 3 but the fruit of the tree which is the mr. garden God hath said ye shall not even need to touch at least you die so she actually believed this God that the server was preaching to her she doesn't say yeah the Lord God has see it knows it yes God this distant God now how does this apply to you the devil will come to you tell you one you don't know God he's not interested in you he doesn't love you he's not a present help in time of trouble to he'll twist the scripture to make you believe something that's not true and three he will reason with you in your mind does the scripture really mean this does it really matter and then for he'll whitewash the consequences of just neglecting the work right because when God said that they eat though the day you'll die God is a God of his word he's a man of his word he doesn't just say something and then and then actually just kind of cotton wool little bit later sake no I don't want to offend people I don't mean that he means exactly what he said so when he said that they eat the other day that day you're gonna die he meant exactly what he said but Satan will come way and say no God's a good God he wouldn't do that to you look you're the only true people upon the earth you'll has children right there's not many believers here I'll bring it into today there's not many believers who believe this he doesn't mean that a mint but God means what he says God means exactly so just so that they were just whitewash the consequences just totally whitewash the consequences of going is the word you won't die and then and that took her away from the word to following a lie so she believed what the serpent told him she had to believe it before the actor was done so the devil rewrote the Bible I just put it today's language he rewrote the Bible or he changed no doesn't really matter how you're baptized doesn't matter what you believe doesn't matter what you do or how you dress or why you believe in three gods you can just do whatever you want that's why said God is a good god is a god of love you know he's not really that serious about things that appear to be little but Moses said it Jesus in adventure live by every word that's right not most of the word not the word that just feels good not the word that just makes you happy but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's right and this so this took her away from the word the following your life and it also took her from under the protection of the word and she fell because God this word is not just a weapon it's also our defense this is a this is a defense as well because if you know like like if the devil comes along and he says he says steal this kill this person I'm just using real obvious things you can bring it down to very subtle things and and you know the devil said just kill this person is rich take his money it doesn't matter you know if there's something in you wanting that and you don't actually stand behind the Word of God you know some people they just step over there conscious they go do those things but if but if you can actually combat that say no the word says thou shalt not kill manage means I shall not murder thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet that's your defense against what he's trying to do to you now so that took her under the protection because she all she had to do was stay behind that word that God gave her and the devil the server would never have got him and it wouldn't be standing here tonight in this condition amen so this is hell so this is the devil's tactics I just read this and maybe I'll just close with these two no I'll just I just I just close with this one this one of a trumpet gives it uncertain sound yeah the devil can he'll come in and he'll say just do this this is not really that important you don't really need to read your ball we don't really need to pray the words on you you don't really need to pray get a better job some just a place you don't really need to come to church you know really neat others of the message yea hath God said you know and what you'll do he'll get people to leave an environment where they can be with fellow Christians like precious faith and when they can grow and their children who grow in an atmosphere the Holy Spirit and he can take those people out to chase a dollar somewhere or chase something else it's not even part of God's plan but then those people who stood behind the Word of God and see what the Bible says 24 signal the assembling of ourselves together sometimes people do have to move to church all these things but sometimes it's for the wrong thing because the reasoning you know the eight people love money people want to earn big money and they wanna they won't catch the Joneses and do all kinds of things those things you know imagine if I if I came to your house and I had a big bag on my back and I was really excited I said look what I've got look what up I look at this I made it up and open the bag and it's just a bunch of pavement but to me it's the most precious thing in all the world I've been working for years and finally I have my I have my bitumen I've got my concrete look at this concrete I've got you'd look at that say you fool yeah what do you mean this is this is invaluable I walk on it people drop gum on it you know people do all kinds of things on that stuff people just drive on it now it's like man who chases gold for the wrong reason that's pavement and heaven but people give their entire lives just for little blocks of it and they cherish it may take you out of there safely then look at it they put it back and they buy more and they chase just a bit of pavement if you think some will be foolish to come and show your big bag of pavement from just off the street here look what I've got multiply that by a billion and that's how foolish our people chasing money just money that's just pavement but if you're not careful the devil trying to eat you go in that direction or just chasing pleat hey this world is pleasure man yep just move to a nicer place you can live on the beach you could just have living a holiday atmosphere all the time everything's blase and you know all these things and the devil trying to get people to go in that direction yeah that's just but we're still Christians well you got to be careful because man can think well it'll go good if it's in the word it will go good but it was the devil leading someone down some part that will not remain good and spiritually they may prosper physically but spiritually where are they where they got and if we're not careful if we're not led by the word then people can have hate the devil can give your dreams he can give you visions he can excite you and certain things but I was not in the word and that will take you somewhere else you don't want to go now I'll just close with this doesn't the trumpet gives an uncertain sound but do you know what God don't have to improve he gave his children his soldiers the very best thing that he could give them when he gives them what did he give them he give them his word at the Garden of Eden and Men was to fortify himself behind the Word of God and no devil can can get him stay in the world now the enemy spies Satan tried to find out what he could do to break into that so he knew he could just come out of bluff her so the only thing he could do was to get here on reasoning and that's what God uses today and that's what God used to fortify his churches as word and Satan comes around with reasoning power who knows that that was the loophole that was the place that people could break the easiest was a reasoning incredible this is the easiest place man can break his reasoning and we think we're cultured and we think we're intelligent and we think we're the most educated people has ever been upon the earth and Satan and the easiest thing and we're if we have all this head stuff the devil can use that and just twisted in our reasoning it's not reasonable that you live this way anymore society's moved on you know just go with the times everybody else is happy why you go in this funny way you know reasoning would say well we are wear a hood you're a herd animal and just go with the pack that's how reasoning would say and if you follow reasoning you'll go the way the world and just be nice Christians and have nice Church and have nice just nice things we don't want just nice things we don't just want nice Church well living God among us amen that's what we want maybe another why shouldn't I stretch it on mice you know educated intellectual discourses of man and just all the stuff you want the Living God amen if you would yeah we don't have him we don't have anything right that's right so so Satan knew there was a loophole dells a reasoning well you say let me just reason with you is that necessary if God said it was necessary necessary whether we have to cry and boohoo and do all this if God said that the baptists of the Holy Ghost is necessary I don't care how how heavy it is how much of the world you have to give up you're going to have to use it one of these things to stay alive the only way of survival amen I'm just going to finish there but we have some we have some musicians to come wait for a bottle will be handed but you see you know I'm going to go into these things in a greater way but if we if we can see there you just see that short but in Genesis I trust it helps this is how the devil comes you know and the devil came against brother branham winners wife was dead and then the little baby was dying you know the devil didn't say to brother ground that God isn't real he said he doesn't care for you what does that mean he's distant and he begin to apply to his reasoning and he said what have you done but you know pray for people and preach and people will be healed all these things look what you've done and this is how he repays you remember I read that quote he says he says to have the Holy Ghost is the only way of survival now by the way I'm said in that dark a he said I was about to agree with him he said I was about to Griffin but if something came up with in him said the Lord giveth and Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord if he doesn't have that on the inside of him and he would have failed and would have said you're right say that God is not a good guy he doesn't care about me this is all the sham because the devil is coming to his reasoning and his reasoning sounded right because if he work for a boss and the bosses meant to be good he should reward you accordingly and if he pretends to be a good boss just takes away the things you hold most valuable he's just lying to you he's just using you since I was about to growth and when something's hit the look of the Lord taketh away he said Sharon rose honey I'll go lay on the arms of mother an hour period I thing on top of each other two different caskets and he just walked on with God my if you don't have him that's right doesn't matter what age you don't have him we we we can't that's the only way of survival is it I want to survive I don't just want to survive on a walk out here rejoicing a man I think Alexander the Great was the best general there was no I our captain defeated everything in this world and all the other worlds Olivia I mean we want to be marching let's how about we sing that well you know we're marching a massage band amen listing it as we go amen stand right a little battle tactics amen better plan I'm 86
