to Colossians later um Second Corinthians I can driw second Corinthians 13 and 3 and 17 sorry I'll get there eventually we're going to get through the service amen so let's just read here a couple of Scriptures it says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen amen so we're we're going through a transformation amen amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious Heavenly Father we just want to thank you so much we can truly say that you are our God and you are the same yesterday today and forever and we are so thankful that we have something to tell Lord that more than just of an account of a historical God but you are alive you are the present you are the great I am and I just want to ask Lord May your anointing flow this morning may you anoint speaker and hearer may you increase our faith father may you take control of every Spirit that's not of you may you have preeminence in this service may your blood cover us and we're asking that you'd forgive us of all of our sins our iniquities cleanse us Lord of every evil thought and may you be glorified we love you so much we thank you for this opportunity that we can gather together and worship as redeemed people under your blood so we thank you Lord have your way in the service for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to I want to talk about the start well I'd probably say this often but I want to start looking into a bit of a subject about the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ so I'm going to preach about you today and maybe we'll see as it goes along but you know we I was um I was pondering a few things this week and I just wanted to start here by you know where where the Apostle Paul says that where the spirit of the Lord is you know before he uh these scriptures he's saying about that the there's a V over the face of the Jews with the reading of Moses and you know because they so there's that Veil when that when that vow is taken away then there is a liberty then there is then there is a then there's an opening or or a revealing of Christ now that word Liberty means to go free as a son so we're no longer we are no longer slaves or servants or anything like that we are the children of God and the reason that the Liberty the spirit of the Lord comes upon us is because we are his children as it says in the book of Galatians because we are Sons he sent forth his Spirit upon us where we cry Abba Father so we do not become Sons or daughters by the new birth we are born again because we are his children now I pray that all of the fear and the worry and the anxiety of am I going to make it would just leave I I believe that we're living in a season where we don't need to be afraid we don't need to guess we don't need to Hope if we're going in a Rapture but God wants it so secured in our hearts Beyond emotion Beyond feelings Beyond good days bad days beyond all those things there's an anchor in our hearts me where we know in whom we have believed like the Apostle Paul says that we can stand in confidence no matter what's going on in life amen so this word here where we're CH where the Apostle Paul says we are changed into the same image from glory to glory so that word change means a trans to be transformed and that's where we get the word of metamorphosis and when you you think of a caterpillar come turning into a butterfly there's a process where that caterpillar is an Earthbound creature can't fly doesn't look like what it's meant to be but it goes through a process where it is transformed from a caterpillar into a butterfly now the life within it transforms it amen it's it doesn't need all it needs to do is eat whoever seen monarch butterflies they'll get on that swamp plant they'll chew the thing down and they'll chew it down all over again but it's by eating that amen the life within them is transformed into the butterfly it's the same thing we all we need to do is feed on the word of God Amen drink enjoy the word pray love the Lord what happens is you're bringing you're feeding your spiritual Inner Man to bring a transformation now if you look at things things can change like a caterpillar looks nothing like a butterfly there's a great change goes place and and even if you look at say natural uh things like for example this is this is the biggest C CI Tree in New Zealand that's that's still standing it's called they call it tan mahuta now that that tree which is I don't know how many 50 meters tall wider than I am tall all these things started as a little seed it started as this little insignificant seed but it was planted in the right ground it received nutrients and then it grew into this big Mighty tree now the life everything within the tree is in the seed brother brah says that that that that that Apple you take one apple seed and it said every bushel of apples that will ever grow from when you PL that seed it grows into a tree and the apples come out is already in that seed all it needs to do is grow be in the right atmosphere and we need to be in an atmosphere of Faith am me an atmosphere of believing where all things are possible saying yes the word is Right amen it doesn't matter how I feel what I'm going through the word is always right and and God is more than able to perform his promises in my life amen because he he fulfills his word in spite of whatever state we find ourselves in amen you see Israel was down in slavery in Egypt but yet God said I'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand so it doesn't matter what condition and God's word nothing can stop him unbelief only hinders the unbeliever amen it doesn't stop God God goes right on and he fulfills his word now here's just a picture of one of those trees cut down you see how wide that bit of the trunk is massive thing started as just a small seed every seed has great potential in it now here's a quiz who's this no one knows who this is there we go Albert Einstein yeah correct correct in the he so he's about 3 years old here in him is the potential to be the greatest mind of the last 100 years the greatest scientific genius he's a three-year-old now you look at him you don't know the potential in him you don't know he's going to write the theory of relativity and do incredible things in science just just within his mind and they do experiments now to prove what he what he put forth as a theory he couldn't prove it necessarily back then but all mathematics and equations and things but came out of him somewhere but as a three-year-old you think there's no way he'd do that he's just probably a naughty little normal boy but within him is genius right as the same thing within us amen there's incredible gifts and ability and an ability to believe the word of God an ability to take God at his word and ability to fully surrender to the full word of God there's incredible potential within you and I just like in the seed of a cry tree there's incredible potential for it to grow now God knows what we're going to turn into right God knows before we're ever born upon the Earth he deposited a seed Gene of God and he said let every seed bring forth after its kind amen if God has planted something it's going to grow it's going to come forth it may be buried for hundreds of years they say well I think it was in brother Bam's day but I think recently they found it too they found seeds that were thousands of years old wheat seeds in Egypt and they planted them and they came to life amen so it can be thousand a seed can be thousands of years dormant but when it comes to the right atmosphere right condition it'll bring forth what's within it amen as the same thing with you and I we can go decades we can go most of our life without knowing god but yet in God's season amen as Sunshine begins to shine and you know Sunshine shines and the water comes everything and what we come to life so that with is which is within us amen comes to life now this is him as an old man now I thought this is good we cannot solve our problems with the same thinging we used when we created them so if you're in this constant cycle of problems say God change my thinking may I think above the way I think may I look more than what I see amen so we can't see because I think he he even said I'm not sure who said it but insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result I mean and man is insane they're doing the same thing look we're coming into a cycle we know it's prophesied there'll be an armagon there's going to be a Great Tribulation but the problems that that that were before the first world war and the second world war and every other great conflict that's been in history they're all here again history repeats itself because man thinks they can do the same thing but get a different result it'll never happen that's why we need the mind of Christ now if you look at the seeds that have been buried but God has planted uh in in someone's life for example the woman at the well you know no one would have thought that she was a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ no one would have thought that they thought she was just a Samaritan she was a hybrid Jew and a I you know Gentile and a Jew lineage and all these things she was a woman of ill Fame but deep down within her was that seed that that that she could recognize the Messiah in her day and that's the greatest thing amen that will ever come out of your life was when you recognize the Messiah the anointed word in the day you live amen that's an incredible blessing to say that's more than a prophet that's more than a Healing Ministry amen this message is more than a Healing Ministry it's more than a prophet amen but is Jesus Christ revealed am mean cuz you're in the same condition like the woman at the well was I mean brother Ram said when when when our lord Jesus spoke to her amen the light of his word redeemed her amen it transformed her life amen from a woman of ill Fame because she dropped her water pot amen she came to the well with all kind of trouble but when she recognized Messiah those troubles just went away I mean and she walked she she ran back into the city saying come see a man who told me everything I ever did is this not the very Messiah and it's the same thing with you and I friends when we recognize this message as Jesus Christ there's a transformation takes place in our life and when we hear the voice behind the voice you say this is not William brandham this is God speaking to me it changes Our Lives it changed my life amen and it still is changing my life Hallelujah you take the you take the you Peter James and John you take the this is Jesus uh calling them no one would have they weren't in the Sanhedrin let's just think about this they weren't in the Inner Circle you know if you went on some if they had YouTube back then and there was debates within the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees and the scribes and different religious Giants of of the day they weren't in those panels they weren't even near those places they weren't even considered but yet God knew that in their souls was that seed of God Amen that he was going to call in his season amen so that's why it's an incredible thing you can never judge a book by its cover you can never judge a person by the outward appearance amen it's that within them that matters and maybe they might not receive it in day one but you just got to believe God Quicken them that's why it's so important to have an atmosphere of faith in our homes an atmosphere of faith in church amen that God can come on the scene and change lives Hallelujah but you see now the devil as God is in The Bu business of transforming the devil loves to deform amen and and and I say naturally this was a this this kind of life she had was a deformed life Paul but well Saul before he became Paul that he was deformed he was deformed by religion deformed by Creeds and dogmas of man but it doesn't matter how deform someone starts that doesn't matter if that seed is going to come to life God will take out all the chinks and make them straight amen make them grow them according to the word amen so because Satan can only pervert he cannot create he's got no he he he's not original right just like so many people there's so many different fashion fads out there and people say I want to be original I want to be something different and they begin to dress like everyone else that's trending amen it's a so there's nothing original nothing new Under the Sun and the devil all he does is deform he can't create he's not a Creator all he can do is deform amen take something from its original state there is where something that's gone wrong with it now I'm going to bring this right into um of course religion because he wants to be worshiped now Satan loves to create he well not that's the wrong word but to deform a true walk with God he wants to deform us Walking with God according to Revelation and he wants to deform it to become a natural Church anity of rules and regulations and all those things that's a deforming amen because brother Braham says it I don't know where the quote is exactly but he said the greatest mistake Israel ever made when they came out of Egypt as they wanted a law you see God already provided them Grace amen he sent a prophet with Y to deliver them he gave them the blood of the Passover the death angel couldn't strike them amen he brought P judgment upon Egypt they didn't have to do a thing all they had to do was believe what that Prophet told them amen and apply the blood but when they came out through the red SE they came to Mount Si they said they wanted a LW and that's the problem is that man has always wanted something to do to Merit salvation and that is the biggest problem is that man has always been trying to add their own bit instead of letting God transform them amen and that's and and and that that's the biggest thing in this day we've got to let God transform us amen not not try and change things ourselves you see see because you know the devil is as I said he is a perverter sin is righteousness perverted amen you know adultery is the right act perverted done wrong fornication the same thing you know a lie is the truth perverted so all he can do is pervert and he wants to bring that into our lives to to to pervert us Walking with God in Victory yeah amen that's that's what he wants us to do like even think about you know you know we are made to be happy we are made to walk in joy we are ordained to walk in Joy ordained to walk in peace you know ordained to walk in love that's what we're ordained to do but the devil will come and pervert the atmosphere in our minds to make us worried about nothing to make us stressed about things that don't matter things that'll change tomorrow you know he tries to that that's why he tries to bring fussing and fighting and ought and trouble what's he doing he's trying to pervert an atmosphere of perfect love into one of tension grief strife and trouble he's just perverting the atmosphere but if you can realize that's what he's doing you can withstand him amen remember he always comes with a lot of Reason a lot of valid he would call points of why and this person did this and this and it can be all right but you have a right to stop that atmosphere and say no I have the Lord has said love thy neighbor as thyself amen love the Brethren amen because remember Jesus forgave me of a lot of things amen the reason he hung on Calvary is not the Romans or the Jews it was me I'm the reason he died I'm the reason he was nailed and M and all those things it was my fault I'm the Man Hallelujah but yet he did it for me anyway amen because he loved me when I was his enemy amen so I think if if if he can love me that kind of love I think I can love you people with that kind of love too when I you know no one's done anything like that to me hallelujah amen so you see the devil wants to create a bad atmosphere in our minds and always trouble and this is a problem and all these things and create a complex even brother bah say someone who's sick too long it can create a complex in their life but God is working everything for your good I mean God is doing something in our lives we we really we need to realize we're not occupying time we're not just going through the motions you say well Monday to Friday I go to the same job I do the same things I go to school it's the same and all these things and God is working in the every day I mean we cannot forget that amen we we see the devil is the author of frustration God is not the author of frustration he's not the author of confusion so the devil will take the peace of God he'll take the you know just walking the everyday simple Christian Life and he'll pervert that by saying God's not doing anything Satan's lying to you Satan's lying to you God is working every day he's doing something in your life he's molding you's you he's doing he's wanting to reveal himself but the devil wants to clad us over with troubles and doubts and he wants to pervert the atmosphere in our mind I say we're done with that amen I'm done hallelujah does that mean he'll stop no he'll he'll try CU he's a creature of habit amen but you see every every spirit that comes against us we have a right to withstand amen amen Draw N to God Amen and the devil will flee amen prise the Lord you see now but the thing is that the devil as I said he loves to pervert now he wants to take he wants to take Christianity now this is what got me thinking about this whole service today just a thought came to mind brother BR speaking Christ is a mystery of God revealed amen so God was God was manifested in Jesus Christ amen and then he what is manifested in the bride in order to take the bride and bridegroom and restore the world right three-fold revelation of God now he says so many people has got the wrong conception to convert Christian uh people to Christianity and to its government it's not God's thought at all now people would say no that is what you do you bring people to church they become believers they conform to however the church operates and no that's just been converted to uh a government of a of a church or denomination that is not God's thoughts at all see as I said about Israel the worst mistake they ever did was wanting a law and the worst mistake a Believer can ever do is say just tell me what I need to do give me a list of things give me a checklist that's not walking with God at all that's conforming to the government of a religion amen but but no we are the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ I mean so this very thought should be foreign to us of trying to get a people to con to to just adapt to a church or religious government that is not God's thoughts at all amen it is not God's thoughts to for man's ability to live a good life and therefore that's Christianity that's not Christianity at all no it's actually a perversion of God wanting of the devil twisting in people's minds of of God wanting to walk with his people he wants to reveal himself to us does he not amen so it's not it's not man's thought I mean it's not God's thought at all to try and get us just to conform to a bunch of rules now we understand there are things in the word that we follow right we understand that but you know it's not a it's not a tick boox thing God needs to reveal to you yeah see even how to dress how to act all these things God needs to reveal it now there's a sister that you know years ago when she first came to the message you know she was you know wearing pants and she started wearing a skirt it was a short skirt but God but then it got longer as she was walking with God now a skirt that's down to the floor is not more righteous than a one that's below the knees long sleeves are not more righteous than short sleeves but man wants to make it that if you're basically wearing a burka you're modest no that is Holiness perverted amen that is Holiness perverted I'm wearing a sack therefore I'm a I'm really Sanctified no that is Holiness perverted now you've got to know what's too tight and not too tight it's a relationship with God it's not rocket science it's Lord is this pleasing to you and maybe at the stage you are maybe it isn't maybe it's not but just walk with God I saying about the sister her her her her her skirt start a real short they got longer but it was God was revealing these things to she was walking with God now I'm sure some people wanted to grab her put her in the front room and and just just just throw the book at her kind of thing but that's trying to convert someone to the government of the church that's not going to bring a birth that's not going to help anyone see and that's why people have miserably failed as they've tried to just adopt what they see as the tenants of the message without knowing God hallelujah amen because if you know him he'll reveal his word to you he will show you the things that are pleasing in not pleasing it's you know it's it's it's it's quite simple yeah I'm sure God talks to us amen why did he die on Calvary to have a true spiritual relationship with you and I amen that we can talk to him and he talks back amen he reveals himself through preaching through his word through prayer all those different ways you know so it's not it was never God's idea to convert people to its government of Christianity no cuz he says here look um we make converts to Christianity buys government that's not it well they're not supposed to drink they're not supposed to lie do you know the muhammadans can outshine you you know the heathens in Africa then black men they've got laws among their tribes that outshine anything you can produce in Christianity am mean so he's saying look this is not how it's meant to be done we're not meant to put Grievous weights on one another of of conforming to to laws like that you know because it's like the Pharisees they would they put laws on the people that they wouldn't bear themselves yeah you know so we can't put Grievous weights on our young people we can't put some weight if you ever conformed to this thing and and you never did it when you were young amen that's right I'm not going to go into detail we'll go into a youth service later I'm just going to lay platform for maybe a month later but you know we don't want to put things on people that they're not ready to Bear you say well that's being too liberal no what it does is it creates an environment where God can deal with them because what it's the same God that met you has got to meet them right and God brought you from a mighty long way he brought me from a deep dark pit what I once was and what I am now thank God I'm not that guy amen but you see God needs to reveal himself they have to want what you have amen you know we we have to sell the product right where we talk about joy unspeakable there should be a manifestation of that Joy there should be a thankfulness you know I think um you know we were talking about you know me or Christine crying and we're saying well most of our tears are happy tears this is what our children Children See happy tears and I think that's how we should be we should be crying happy more than sad amen and even when we're sad well there's no we we don't have a sadness that that is without hope cuz our God is more than able amen we are not undone we're not lost we're not you know we're not without hope now our God can do anything amen so well you say well if it's not to be like that then what's it meant to be well brother BR makes it real clear now God now notice God make himself n we're not supposed to convert uh make converts to Christianity by its government but by the Revelation amen that's how we make converts to Christ amen is that when they receive the revelation of Jesus Christ when you receive the Revelation that you're a sinner that's a glorious thing am me when you gave your life to the Lord what's that God has begin to reveal himself to you begin to speak to your life what is he doing he wants to convert you to real Christianity amen that you would walk with him and know him in the power of his resurrection amen that's why it's so important that Revelation is key amen I trust that we pray for our children that they would receive Revelation that God would drop it in their hearts that this is not just church this is not just people Gathering but this is God and man uniting together amen that's what the message came to do is that God would dwell in man once again and manifest his word amen so people are made so people come into the bride body of Jesus Christ by Revelation amen as Paul said by one Spirit we're baptized into one body amen that's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so that's why that's why you say you know people are ask a question are you a Christian they want to know what kind of Christian you are and um you know but but we're not Christians by joining a church right amen but you're but you're a Christian if you're a born again creature amen if you've been born again amen you're a Christian amen you've been born into the family amen you got to see like you know brother Brown makes a statement you know he's been in the he said he was in the brandom family like 53 years no one asked them to join the family I never asked my girls or will do you want to join the gloin family will you ever ask that L will you ever ask that question no you're born into the family amen so so if they were born into the family nothing can take them out of the family amen if they join the family we could say well no they're not part of the family but no they it's impossible for my children to actually be to to leave the glowing family because because they are blood relation to me amen my DNA is in them amen my life is in them amen if we had a blood test it would prove are my children they're not distant relatives they are my children amen so it's the same thing when you're born into the kingdom amen you see you never joined it see the devil tries to get you to unjoin it you should leave this there's nothing to it you should go into the world go do something else he's trying to get you to break up your membership but he's got the wrong picture cuz none of us joined we were born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost and me the word came out away and transformed us so if we're born in we can't get unborn out Hallelujah we can't get unborn out friends see that's why it's so important we realize that we we have been brought in by a supernatural birth amen God has quickened his word to us amen so we can't be unjoined the devil says leave you say well I can't leave I'm part of the body amen it's like my you know my arm can't suddenly just just pop out and walk off somewhere and no it's part of my body amen it can't it can't just say I'm sick of this guy and I'm done no it's part of me Hallelujah and we're part of him Lord hallelujah we may get sick of ourselves but he doesn't get of us amen why cuz we're part of him hallelujah amen but you see organization is something that's been adapted or adopted into the program of God but it's never ever meant to be that way amen it's meant to be divine revelation amen is to come into our lives to speak to us and show us who we really are now you see but the devil loves to take the Supernatural and and swap it for the natural that's what he's done down Through the Ages that's why you know churches used to be cold for lukew powerless is because he took the moving of the spirit the power of God the signs and wonders done the reality of Walking with God and he adopted into a natural program I've just learned these doctrines learn this way and then you're a Christian see that's a natural program but God's word is never meant to be that way no we are called to be the powerhouses of the Holy Ghost amen where people come into our presence and they feel refreshed cuz there's those Shady Lea leaves of Fellowship amen over our lives there's an atmosphere we carry amen that lifts burdens brings peace brings joy that I trust when people meet you and then they leave they feel better amen why because they've been in the presence of God irrespective of how you are in here see our emotional realm and our spiritual realm can be two different things am mean because remember you can be troubled inside but you're still anointed amen you can be in Dire Straits but you're still anointed I mean that life in you is still bringing forth praise the Lord amen you can be sick but you're still anointed amen you can be poor but still anointed you can not know what what's to happen tomorrow but you're still anointed amen why cuz you are the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we got to realize now we are a special people I mean God has born you birthed you into the kingdom we are his children he said Can a you know a mother can forget a suckling child but I cannot forget thee Hallelujah so I know I don't know how that's possible for a natural woman to you know forget a child but God said that that may even be the case but I'll never forget thee you're engraved in the palm of my hands before the foundation of the world you are thoughts and my mind and now you hear upon the earth now it's amazing you know I was thinking about the um you know brother Bram when he was going through Montana and you know the Lord told him to stop the car and look at this Seven Peaks of these mountains now I I found a photo but it's not a very good quality one so I didn't put it up but it's amazing when you know you look at those you look at that photo now those mountains are called brandom Peaks and it wasn't Believers that named it some geological board guy decided this is Brandon Peak so maybe someone brandom climbed I don't know but but it isn't it amazing I don't know when those mountains were formed but before they ever formed they're in God's mind I'm going to have Malachi 4 come in a certain season I'm going to write his life in these mountains and he caused those mountains to come up right he had all that there before brotherr even came upon the Earth and then now he tells him look at this your life is written in those mountains those mountains are symbolic of the life that you are living and it's incredible when you look into the book of Revelation there's symbols in the book amen part of them is the Bride of Jesus Christ you know I was thinking of Revelations 19 when the Lord would come with that you know you know the word of God the the sword coming out of his mouth and the armies of Heaven coming with him you know those are all symbols of the Bride of Jesus Christ am mean coming to fight the battle of Armageddon so before we ever turned up it was a symbol in the book just like before he has ever born those mountains are a symbol of his life amen so so they they were there before we even turned up amen they were there before we even realized they were there and that Hallelujah so God has prepared things to show us what we're going to be amen but now it's like a you know he sees what's in the seed and then he produces the life that's in that seed so he sees what's in the word and he knows you're going to become it amen hallelujah amen he knows you're going to become it so when it says in Revelations 19 earlier that the bride is made herself ready and unto her should should be was granted should be ar raay in linen clean and white the righteous of saints that was there for th you know 2,000 years before you showed up Hallelujah God had it Neons of time but he he knew your life will match that symbol just like you knew brother bram's life would match the mountains amen so God had all these things pre-ordained amen and then then he brought us here to match what he already had in his mind Hallelujah so that's why we are not converting people to Christianity by its government no it's by Revelation amen because if it becomes by if it comes by Revelation to you which it must then you realize I'm part of this I'm not just here because I decided it was a nice place the meals are good the music's good the whatever's good no I'm here because I'm part of this word that's why I'm part of this body you know wherever we go to church we got to realize we are part of the word of God Amen just like when you read in the Book of Revelation I saying about the bride and different things you begin to realize that symbols you it's no longer a symbol it's now Revelation manifested amen so Hallelujah that I think it's a wonderful thing you see we can never organize the Church of the Living God as a government no it's by divine revelation Hallelujah now let's just look at this if if if someone's not feeling happy I'm going to make you happy cuz I'm going to read about you what he's already done amen and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be in the Earth or things in heaven and you who's you that's me that's you that were sometime alienated and EM enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight that's got to become a revelation he's not saying he might he has hallelujah amen and it's and see really When I See This I say Lord I just see the work of your hands what you have done for me amen so he's he has come in this end time to present us holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight now this is a God who sees all things amen he You Can't Hide nothing from him but yet I've made you holy unblamable and reproval in his sight you can't pull the wool over his eyes he sees all things the only way that all those anything against you can be struck off if it's under the blood of Jesus Christ amen because if it goes under the blood God can't see it amen he says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled that you be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a minister now this word continue means to remain to abide to continue amen so if you realize you're part of the word you're going to abide in it Hallelujah you're you're not going to leave the word just like you know uh Ruth didn't realize it at the time but when she came into boaz's field Boaz said stay in this field don't leave this field you stay right in this field she didn't realize that she was going to be married to Boaz one day and that field was part of her because she was part of him it's the same thing when we come into the word of God God says stay in this field stay in the field of the son of man stay in this revealed word gleen get what you can out of it amen and God wants to reveal to you actually this field belongs to you because you belong to him amen you're part of him so if you realize see see if if we just come into the message by an intellectual understanding converting to his government just because of well these dos and don'ts and rules and regulations then you can leave because it's just something you adopt it's something that you take on it's a good idea amen but if but if you come in the right way by divine revelation you cannot leave you will abide in the word of God you cannot leave the word amen Hallelujah so we're going to see if you continue in the faith and and and we know faith is a revelation so if you continue in the Revelation grounded and sealed and be not moved away from the hope and hope is an expectation with pleasure of the Gospel yeah amen so that's why we've got to continue in the Revelation Amen Let God reveal his word to us don't be don't be intimidated by great intellectual Minds you know but just walk with God and let him reveal it to you amen but we're not done amen so I just like like this strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who did this for me he did you know it's like the great feast there in the you know uh Middle East and so there in Jesus's day you could be a beggar you could be the richest man in the country you come in the same door you're welcome the same way your feet are washed you've given a new robe you're anointed kiss made welcome when you go through that process you're all the same who makes the person meet to come into the feast the one who invites them it's not the person who comes to the door it's the one who's done done the invitations that person makes the meat to come into the feast amen so it doesn't matter where we come from amen he's made us meat amen he's to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins amen that makes me happy I like Colossians it makes me real happy when you read what God has done hallelujah why because he's delivered us he set us free from the powers of Darkness Satan has no hold he may try but he has no right amen because remember God delivers you and then God wants to reveal in you yeah What You're Made Of now that's why he lets the devil come back amen because the show when the Devil comes back and he tries to get you once he would Stomp all over your life and do what he wanted but when he comes back there's now a resistance there's no no no there's a strong man in the house Satan get away from me in the name of Jesus Christ you once trampled over my life but now I'm going to trample over you am me because I have a right now by the blood of Jesus Christ by the authority of God I'm the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ I have a right to stomp on your feet I mean stomp on your head amen hallelujah why cuz he the Lord has delivered us that's why we can't Buckle when Satan comes against us again Jesus had three great Temptations in the wilderness he with every one of them by the word of God Amen he didn't say you're the first one then you then the Devil comes back Jesus didn't say oh no I'm under a great trial now this is terrible the devil's coming against me again no he withstood him with the word how many times do we get all worried CU just cu the Devil comes back he's a creature of habit he has no new ways he's just he's just a rinse and repeat kind of guy copy paste copy paste copy paste he's got nothing new okay so you should even expect him to come back but don't live in fear because the one who conquered hell death in the grave conquered Calvary conquered everything lives in you now greater is he that's in you the he that's in the world so don't be see we should not be living in fear the devil's going to get me devil no Jesus already got me amen Jesus already got me I'm safe and secure in the Rock of Ages the devil can't get me none he may trouble my mind he may give me sickness he may do all those things but he cannot take amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost he cannot take eternal life out of me amen hallelujah now praise God so there's a transformation that takes place if you keep walking by Revelation amen just keep walking with God say God reveal them all to me i' sure you know prob the devil says well you've heard that before you've read that before this probably the sermon you may be heard before in a different kind of way but God wants to reveal more to you you know I remember reading a novel that I you read when I was a kid I read it again I thought well it's exactly how I remembered it put it away you know but when you read this word you hear the message something always new jumps out jumps out because it's God's Eternal Word sir now we think of David's Mighty Men rough and tough and Gruff and you know all these things but many times we're always looking at the end picture right just like the Bride of Jesus Christ we look at the end picture it's good to look at the end picture but we don't realize that that that these men went through a process they went through a transformation I mean they did not join David in this way they did not join David as giant Killers one to one killed 800 men in different you know in great exploits of Faith No choreographed Hollywood scenes here this was one man with a sword or a spear killed 800 no one else stood with him all these incredible things acts of Bravery they did not come to David in that condition they didn't come in that we got to remember this amen they did not come in that condition look look at the condition they came in David therefore departed then and escaped to the Cave of uh Cave abdull and when his Brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down hither to him and everyone that was in distress now just keep this picture in your mind do these guys look in distress and everyone that was in debt I'm going to flick back and forth do these guys look in debt and everyone that was discontented do they look like that no these guys are the Elite of the elite these are the SAS of the SAS right here you know so they don't look in distress there but when they came they were in that picture they didn't look like they were in debt but when they came they were and everyone that was discontented they don't look discontented there gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with them about 400 men now now God was going to show with these men the bride body of Jesus Christ as a as a shadow amen he was going to show this is what I'm going to do in the end time I'm going to gather people I'm going to gather people amen they're going to come in all different ways they're going to come discontented brokenhearted troubled all these things but I'm going to transform them by the anointing of the word amen I'm going to transform them to be Mighty Sons and Daughters of God I'm going to make them Mighty Gentile Warriors amen not ones who worry about everything no Warriors amen what is a real worrier in this day amen someone who takes God at his word in spite of everything the devil can throw at him Hallelujah so this word stress it means to be in a narrow place that is a confinement or a disability and anguish distress a straightness these ones came in maybe may you know disability so you think of that as a physical disability that they couldn't walk right they couldn't talk right we were all like this when we came to the Lord we couldn't walk right in this world we were walking like this going after every shiny thing I mean that the flesh wanted you know we couldn't think right we had trouble we were you know this is how they came amen and then those who are discontented they were bitter yeah they weren't smiling coming to the cave of abdull hey David I I hear you coming into Power I'm here to join you no they were bitter they were angry they had bitterness they were chafe things were rubbing them their lives they had trouble they were discontented they were they were heavy they had all these kind of things going on but they didn't stay that way I mean God was going God gathered them to show what he's going to do as a mighty Army in this end time I'm actually looking I don't I don't know if you realize it but that's you you say well I can't really grow facial here like that I'm an Apache I can't do it no but that's you Hallelujah even the we'll leave there anyway you see but that's your photo that's like class photo of 2024 right there Mighty Mighty Warriors amen but you see the reason they became that way is because they are beholding an image just like our opening scripture they are beholding a king coming into Power th are beholding an anointed Son of God that was anointed by a Vindicator Prophet amen that there's a prophecy over his life you're going to be on the throne of Israel amen so they were beholding this image amen when they were following David around and then the anointing that was on David now came onto them amen because the same anointing David used to kill a lion and a bear and a you know Giant and all these things amen was the same anointing came on them and they did Mighty exploits of Faith am mean three of them cut through 15 miles of Philistines to get David a drink I mean you think about the odds of those things how on Earth could that be am mean naturally you think three men like I think even in war these days you know there's a Doctrine when you're attacking a enemy force in order to win you you have to outnumber them 3: one that's what they say to have a successful assault on an enemy position you got to outnumber them 3 to one now three of these guys fought through 15 miles of men I think the scales are a bit different than a 3 to1 success ratio but the thing is they did not look at the odds they looked at the anointing they looked at the promised word they weren't looking about odds who cares about odds see the odds were against us even to come here even our natural lineage you think there were great plagues Wars famines troubles against our forebears but yet we made it amen there was the the devil would have killed us all if he could have but we made it see the devil don't have enough to stop you fulfilling God's plan in your life our Lord Brother Bram said that nothing can take you from this life until your purpose is fulfilled nothing amen so we're going to realiz that you know we we we are here supernaturally amen so these ones weren't looking at odds they were looking at the promise word of their day and what happened is that same anointing came onto them they went through a transformation amen they weren't from you know they went from discontented people in debt Amen in distress to Mighty Gentile Warriors amen when they stood there and slew hundreds by themselves they weren't in distress they knew my God will fight for me amen I know the David's coming into Power am mean I know the anointing is on him and now that anointing is upon me they did Mighty exploits of faith and we know this word is coming into power we know Jesus is going to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium amen irrespective of what's going on in the world what trouble strife and whatever's hashtagging trending on the internet we know he's coming into Power amen and that same anointing that's on this message comes into us hallelujah and we realize that we are the bride body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah why because we begin to see see even even the everyday Christian Life we live it's an incredible thing am mean to go to school and still be a believer is an incredible thing am mean to go through that big mess of peer pressure amen is incredible thing that's an incredible thing you say God's not doing anything in my life but you still beli well you say well I got a lot of Mind battles the reason you got mind battles is the devil's trying to get a hold of you but something in you is saying no hallelujah hallelujah there's a resistance there that's good amen praise the Lord so this everyday Christian Life we live is in the face of everything the devil's built to try and get our attention but the Lord has done a work in our lives that we don't want what he has that's right cuz we know our King is coming into Power amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God now where am I going here see Faith takes care of everything yes sir brother says in my house I'm just going back to the thought of we're not here to convert anyone to the government of Christianity but it's by Revelation see you try to tell them what they must stop doing see and say well I must do this and that or the other no you see that isn't the question what must I do not what must I stop doing amen but you just do what you're supposed to do and all the rest of it will take care of it itself you're lying stealing drinking gambling and doing the things that's evil it'll stop when you do what Paul answered his question what must I do to be saved he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved amen so many times we say stop do stop doing this this is wrong and that and that may be all true but what's the remedy is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ I mean when Faith goes to work when you became a Believer let's just go down memory lane yeah yeah yeah amen amen am I drank I stole I lied I did all kinds of evil things but when Faith came in and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God all those things left me I didn't have to go through an AA thing or a um you know go on some Monastery and pray and have some mindfulness season and all this kind of stuff to try and suppress things that now I'm a Christian no when faith comes in unbelief goes out amen that's why it's so important we encourage believe on the Lord Jesus Christ we say well I'm going through some trouble believe believe on the Lord Jesus Christ my family's gone away with believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I need a job believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you know I need all this besetting sin of My Life Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ let Faith come in let Revelation come in and that will take care of everything maybe that's too simple for some people but I'm simple and I like it amen cuz Faith moves mountains amen Faith creates an atmosphere of love amen Faith brings Deliverance amen Faith brings the promises of God and manifests them amen Faith brings resur ction amen Faith brings healing amen Faith brings Deliverance Faith brings every promise of God faith will bring the Rapture into being amen Faith brings the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what brings the promises of God so believe the Lord Jesus Christ say Lord you're more than able to do it for me Hallelujah you see don't look at the circumstances look at the promise Hallelujah yes sir amen that's it's so important we we just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen have faith in him he's going to do it how's going to do it I don't know but he's going to do it that's the main thing amen I I don't know the details I I may work in science but I'm not a details guy God will fulfill his word we must have absolute confidence amen we got to re oh I can find this this is why it's such a dangerous thing de slides amen here we are look see if we could just ever get the scare out of the people what is the scare what do I have to do how do I line up believe that's how you line up with the word have faith in his word and your life will line up with it but the scar is have I done enough have I done this enough have I what am I doing no he is in the picture if you're in the picture you've got to move the mirror to look at him you got to change your picture who is salvation is of the Lord amen the the Rapture will be of the Lord amen the dead and Christ Rising will be of the Lord amen the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ is of the Lord amen it's not our thoughts it's his thoughts it's not your word it's his word it's not your desire it's his desire amen it's him living through his body Hallelujah see well I don't know if it no it doesn't see my arm doesn't have any mental faculties it's all from here comes into here whatever this does this does right there's no there hasn't there doesn't have to be a debate if my brain says okay pick this up and the arm says no I would rather just push it you know there's not no this is surrendered to this yeah right and if we are surrendered to him if we're surrendered to him it's not our thoughts it's just his word living through US amen hallelujah see if we could ever get the scare out of the people that something oh I don't know what you're uh what you're wanting a little touch me or hocus po Pocus see God's word is your Basics God say so just laid out there perfect that's where we believe it see it's not nothing oh if I can just do this or that it's not what you what you done it's what God has done for you that's why I read that in Colossians is what he has already done amen so the devil wrestles with you saying is it really for you is it not forget his lies and say God's already done it for me you confess it and walk into that confession amen you got to believe you're saved you got to say yes Lord You're My Savior then what he saves you see many times we say Lord can you do it he already has done it he can only act on our profession our confession so if you confess you'll never get anywhere with God you'll stay there right but if you confess Lord you're more than able Lord you put your life within me to transform me into your word you'll do it he'll do it amen there power and confession God has given you the ability to speak his word amen now see amen okay it's what God has done for you it's people say oh if I can just keep holding on it ain't you holding on it's whether he held on or not he held on that day on Calvary he held on hallelujah praise the Lord amen it's whether he it ain't what I am it's what he is what he represented me as God don't see me as I am if I'm in Christ he sees Christ he don't see me no more for I'm dead my life is hidden him sealed by the Holy Ghost covered by the blood you get that then God takes the faith that Abraham had and place plac it in every Believer by the Holy Spirit you get it then you begin to believe all things hope all things that's when the gospel goes to work in the heart what you believe you begin to believe and hope and that hope is an expectation you have an expectation that all things in God's word he's going to fulfill amen that's how you know that God's done a work in your heart you can believe for the impossible irrespective of what you're seeing in your life right now you can take God's word say God you're more than able to do it praise the Lord amen see you believe all things now why see before I became a Christian I was a skeptic but then when he met me I said well if God can save me he can save everyone well I begin to believe for all things amen you say and and and that's how we should be with every circumstance I'm sick but God's my healer amen I may yeah I need this or whatever but God can supply it amen amen my family's this or whatever no but God's more than able amen that's why it's so important now because the anointed bride body Jesus Christ that lives by revelation we live by the word amen amen we don't live by Church politics we don't live by religious politics trying to be better than the next family or this family that family no we live by the word of God all of us are sovereign sovereignly LED according to the word of God Amen and we live by the word and if we live live by the word amen God will manifest that word now that's not you trying to produce it that's you surrendering to the word if you want to live by the word surrendered to the word I mean you take Elijah he surrendered to the vision that God gave him of what would happen on Mount carel he surrendered to it and he fulfilled it amen because before the fire fell he said Lord I've done all this according to Thy word may now the people know you are God and you've turned their hearts back again so he saw it as a vision and then he lived out that vision and then God fulfilled the vision that's why the thing is when it's Quicken to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when that becomes a reality to you you walk in it you receive the Holy Ghost amen why you surrender yourself to the vision of God amen amen hallelujah and that's what the word is you you you surrender to it and let it live amen and that's why it's so important that we stay with the word all right you take because God only backs up his word now this this is this is Micaiah here um with the 400 prophets and the two kings one's Ahab by this stage there's already been a prophecy come from Elijah saying that Micaiah I mean that sorry ahab's ahab's blood is going to be lick by dogs he's going to die in battle amen but they had 400 prophets there saying that they're going to win they're going to take ramoth Gilead they're going to have Victory who knows the story amen but but I think it's Jehoshaphat the righteous King said but yeah sure you got 400 sure that was a great meeting there's a mighty stir going on there seemed very Supernatural but do you have one more prophet and I yeah yeah I just imagine Ahab maybe a delayed reaction crosses his arms looks at him saying just thinking what yeah I have one more but I hate him I mean he hates me he always preaches evil against me you know Micaiah son of IM Jehoshaphat said let's get him too so now here comes here comes uh you know the delegates come maybe maybe some of the head deacons or whatever they come down to Mah and say now now listen you've caused trouble in church why did he caused trouble because Ahab had Christianity according to a government right but Micaiah had Revelation and so now here comes Micaiah and these delegates are try to tell him listen this is what we prophesied you should have seen the head of the organization the head Pastor he made these two horns and Manny God enthusi running the aisles they're going to push them out of the country all these things you just say what has been said because it was God therefore amen you can come back into fellowship and then mAh said I will only say what God has put in my mouth and so that night he prayed he had a vision amen of what would happen in the battle but he took that vision and subjected to the prophecy that was already given see the devil always try and get us off the line with different things amen but no and so that's why he could stand in front of the Kings and say I see Israel scattered without a shepherd and they begin to say about how there was a lying Spirit came up before God and said oh I will get them to believe me and he anointed them and because the reason reason is those 400 prophets they didn't stay with the word see amen but because Micaiah was part of the Bride body of Jesus Christ if I put it that way he stayed with the word of God Amen and what happened is because he lived by the word amen the word was fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah but you see now here's a big problem maybe this is a whole different thought but I'm just going to throw it in the end here now Satan if he cannot get you to disbelieve the word to try and get you to see he'll try and get you to get people to conform to the the government of Christianity he'll get you to try and get off from walking in Revelation and try and get people to conform to the government don't do this do this stop this this is how things should be all these things instead of letting God reveal himself to people right if he can't do that then he will make you a supernatural offer he'll make you a supernatural offer to try and get you to disbelieve the word then he makes you a supernatural offer I'm going to come back to all this just in closing see he if he can't tempt you away from the word no I'm I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer he said I'll tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple and and and and bring back up see show the people that that you can do something supernaturally this is what he'll try and do but boy he got them there now watch this watch this watch when you get to the end where this temptation come maybe he might let you speak in tongues think you got it see or he might let you prophesy though it not be with the word I've seen people stand up and prophesy was contrary to the word as East is from the West see it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by handful certainly it don't mean one thing now I'm not against gifts I'm sure you've heard me long enough to understand that but thing is he will give you a supernatural offer as long as it takes you off the word of God so it doesn't matter how Supernatural something is it's got to line up with the word and the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ only lives by the word amen the the devil try and give you all kinds of promises all kind of things see he says I'll even let you I'll let you do this I'll let you speak in tongues I'll let you prophesy but it will be contrary to the word and Satan can hand them out by the handful see this is why we've just got to live a simple Christian Life and let God live however he wants to manifest himself we know we're living in the season of the spoken word I me we know we're living a time when the gifts are restored and we see the gifts now in here we understand the moving of the Holy Spirit we see all those things here but don't ever get off of a line where you think that the a a a supernatural move of God if it's contrary to the word is something you should stay with you know someone said to me ages ago well you've just got to experiment with the gifts no one here you got to experiment then you can finally get in how it actually works to me that is deadly you don't experi you don't experience anything with a with a spirit you got to take it back to the word of God it's got to be Lord cover me in your blood if you want to speak through me cover me in your blood Lord you speak if you want me to prophesy may it not be Lord cover me in your blood may it be you speaking I don't want to speak a lie I don't want to damage the body of Jesus Christ I don't want to preach something that's contrary to your word Lord I must stay with your word Lord because this the bride body of Jesus Christ lives by the word the Holy Ghost within us lives by the word amen we can't go deviate of into something else we must stay exactly amen with the word of godj Hallelujah how on because that's how the devil will try and deform someone by bringing something in contrary to the word of God but friends all we need to do see God the veils come off the word the seals have come off the book am mean Christ is unveiled in this day all we need to do is behold the word in prayer listen to it read absorb it think about it pray and let him change you to match his word amen I think we got to Behold The Right image the Mighty Men beheld David and became Gentile Mighty Gentile worriors Anointed with the same anointing the apostles beheld Jesus this is why Jesus took them through incredible experiences not just to prove who he was but to get them to see I'm going to take you through these things that when I in you these same things will happen in your life amen it's the same thing that's why brother Braham was used in this end time to demonstrate God would use him to demonstrate the power of the Cross and to show what a redeemed son is capable of fully surrendered to God not just that we're look at it say that's a neat thing but it say God he showed us that to show us what the body of Jesus Christ is going to become amen and friends I believe we're there I I believe we're not becoming we have become but we need to realize what we are right now that because now we are the sons and daughters of God not one day now we are why are you part the body of Christ because you born into it why were you born into it because you're a child of God I mean you didn't join it you were born into it hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's just finish this shall we amen let's have the musicians uh this morning amen he say it's quite a change well you went from Darkness into life you went from Lost to found that's a change that's a real transformation amen you're once alienated from God now you're living his presence that's a transformation praise the Lord amen so let us let him let us let him transform us into His Image more and more amen we'll come to this thought maybe another time but you know praise the Lord amen faith is a revelation walk in that Revelation let them unfold more to you amen now praise the Lord let's um how many times do we look at our children and think what's in them do you ever look at your kids and say I wonder what's in them what's what's really in them I doubt very much Einstein's parents had an idea what he was what was within them but it came out amen so I pray we treat our children say Lord there's a gift in their life there's a part of you in there may we raise them that that comes to life amen that they know what it's like to surrender to the word of God let God live through them hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's stand

the convention you know he he was part of the United States Army they gave him the best training and equipment that was on the planet but one thing they could not give him was promise of Victory we have the promise of Victory you know the devil fights he knows he's going to win but he fights like he's going to win and many times we fight knowing we're going to win but we're going to lose if that makes sense you know we're going to fight that we're winning and we're going to win amen we shouldn't despair we just walk on with God and and and praise Him Amen in every circumstance amen amen let's
