[29:06] things there and
[29:07] i want to speak on well i don't i've
[29:09] renamed it it's just called national
[29:11] spirits
[29:12] and uh
[29:13] yeah
[29:15] you know
[29:17] oh my i don't think you can read that it
[29:19] says here
[29:20] born a kiwi born again an eagle
[29:23] amen hallelujah amen we'll get into it
[29:27] but let's just turn in our bibles to
[29:29] ephesians 6 12
[29:31] hallelujah and then we'll have a you can
[29:34] have your seats after that
[29:36] and um i'll just move that
[29:38] oh somebody's helping me there
[29:41] thank you
[29:42] amen
[29:44] well
[29:46] it looked bigger on my screen
[29:48] it always does
[29:50] oh my well praise god i'll read it from
[29:53] here so it says here in ephesians 6 12
[29:55] if you've got it there it says for we
[29:57] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[29:59] against principalities against powers
[30:02] against rulers of the darkness of this
[30:04] world against spiritual wickedness in
[30:06] high places amen may the lord add his
[30:09] blessing to the reading of his word you
[30:11] may be seated
[30:12] amen
[30:13] hallelujah
[30:16] two national spirits well ashley you
[30:18] know
[30:19] we come from many places in the world
[30:21] and um
[30:23] but actually when you move here you come
[30:25] under the jurisdiction of this one
[30:27] naturally speaking it's attached to the
[30:29] body it's attached to the flesh and the
[30:31] spirit gets caught up in between and but
[30:33] your flesh body your natural birth the
[30:35] natural part of you is connected in some
[30:39] way somewhat by influence to
[30:42] the national spirit of new zealand so
[30:44] when you move here you're coming under
[30:46] you not naturally speaking under the
[30:49] dominion or domain you could say of the
[30:51] influence of these spirits here and
[30:54] therefore if you let it go and you just
[30:57] just consume it you know and just follow
[30:59] it and and and and have your affections
[31:02] towards the new zealand national spirit
[31:04] you will become that
[31:05] you will it will start to materialize in
[31:08] your life but first it starts in your
[31:10] thinking and the way that you think and
[31:12] so tonight i want to talk a lot more
[31:15] about the mind you know and about how
[31:17] you're thinking because this is really
[31:19] where the issue
[31:21] or it starts right there you know in the
[31:23] mind and what you're thinking about all
[31:25] the time as the saying goes we are no
[31:28] higher than our thoughts
[31:29] and actually ultimately if you get the
[31:31] mind of christ you've got his thoughts
[31:34] amen
[31:35] amen and therefore you'll think like him
[31:37] and that is the whole objective of our
[31:40] walk is to have the mind of christ and
[31:41] to continue to go from glory to glory
[31:45] and walk until we're just thinking the
[31:47] same things as him on the wavelength
[31:49] who's heard that before we're on the
[31:51] wavelength amen we're on the frequency
[31:54] who likes to be on the frequency of the
[31:56] holy ghost amen and when you're thinking
[31:58] it's like you you can just pray and it's
[32:00] the will of god
[32:02] amen hallelujah well i you certainly
[32:05] won't get there if you start to employ
[32:07] the national spirit in new zealand
[32:09] oh my and there the new zealand national
[32:11] spirit is a she's a she's a whopper
[32:14] and we're gonna get into it
[32:17] my now the thing is you know we bring a
[32:19] lot of different um identities you could
[32:22] say naturally speaking now i'm gonna
[32:24] kind of we'll just go down the natural
[32:25] line a little bit but then we will we're
[32:27] going to hit the spiritual line because
[32:29] i believe that we're of another spirit
[32:31] amen we're of another culture we're of
[32:33] another national spirit and i happen to
[32:35] be a patriot of that national spirit
[32:38] who's a patriot of the heavenly national
[32:40] spirit amen you know we don't want to
[32:42] get all patriotic about new zealand or
[32:44] about america or about korea or south
[32:47] africa amen anyone else anywhere else
[32:50] here canada no we don't want to get
[32:52] patriotic amen about those things amen
[32:54] hallelujah maybe in the millennium and
[32:57] if you get to live there you can be
[32:58] patriotic then you know we'll have some
[33:00] fun
[33:02] amen but we all cleaned up by then you
[33:04] know amen
[33:06] hallelujah hallelujah so i want to just
[33:08] read um you know
[33:11] you're born a kiwi
[33:13] and i'm just gonna let's just pretend
[33:15] we're all born in new zealand okay
[33:16] you're born a kiwi and but you're born
[33:18] again a eagle
[33:21] and a kiwi can't fly but an eagle can
[33:24] fly
[33:25] amen and so you can see
[33:28] i don't know how that got past the the
[33:30] thinking filters of new zealand's
[33:31] identity it's a crisis
[33:35] it's an absolute crisis that that we
[33:37] call ourselves kiwis you know and oh my
[33:39] [Laughter]
[33:41] you know
[33:43] as at least america was thinking right
[33:45] you know when they identified with an
[33:46] eagle at least you know naturally
[33:48] speaking
[33:49] man
[33:51] i don't know what else other kind i've
[33:52] never really done research but you know
[33:54] there's always some sort of animal or
[33:56] some creature or something that these
[33:58] countries are represented by
[34:00] amen but you know for tonight we're just
[34:02] going to talk about
[34:03] the our what what pertains unto us here
[34:06] in new zealand and the principalities
[34:09] and the powers that are over uh new
[34:12] zealand you know there is dominions is
[34:13] you know the devil sets up a system like
[34:15] you see the government and you got the
[34:17] prime minister and you've got the
[34:18] ministers of the cabinet and you've got
[34:21] different levels well it just works like
[34:23] that in the spiritual realm as well
[34:25] and there's the devil places probably
[34:27] demons that do really good and do work
[34:30] really well or whatever he gives them a
[34:31] promotion and they get a nation over
[34:33] them because they do a good job at being
[34:35] evil and bad
[34:36] and they've got to they've managed to
[34:38] wrangle i don't know how they do it but
[34:41] anyway they managed to get themselves a
[34:42] position but then they have other ones
[34:44] under them and they've got ones for i
[34:46] mean there's definitely one and up heart
[34:48] and the up heart one is very it's very
[34:50] hard to deal with
[34:53] man
[34:55] sorry that is a real running joke for me
[34:58] and isaac and probably those that have
[34:59] been around for a while
[35:01] i won't go into it it might be it might
[35:03] come across as being discriminatory but
[35:05] thankfully we're not part of that you
[35:06] know we don't identify all that but you
[35:08] see what i'm trying to say is there is a
[35:10] hierarchical system that governs new
[35:13] zealand spiritually
[35:15] and it's like politics it kind of goes
[35:17] with what people are
[35:19] ascribing to and then it just
[35:20] capitalizes on certain natures of people
[35:23] and the way it was and they're like oh
[35:25] that's a good bondage i'm going to make
[35:27] the kiwi spirit like that and then we're
[35:29] going to promote that and they just push
[35:30] that and they they aggravate people to
[35:32] get agendas going and protest going that
[35:35] will bolster an evil way or a godless
[35:39] way and new zealand is a very it was it
[35:42] actually was based on you know religious
[35:45] and christian principles but eventually
[35:47] it has obvious it's become one of the
[35:48] most atheistic countries in the world
[35:52] man it's pretty hard to believe you know
[35:54] i mean uh that's i you know when i first
[35:56] got awakened by god and i i read our
[35:59] national anthem
[36:01] and i thought man
[36:03] my this is like such a christian song
[36:05] you know we just sung it all our lives
[36:06] and never even thought about it
[36:09] i honestly didn't think about it i sung
[36:12] it and i didn't believe in god or
[36:14] anything like that in my earlier days
[36:16] and yet you just sing it and i thought
[36:18] when you look back and you think man and
[36:20] all the the the structure and the
[36:22] churches and everything that was here
[36:24] and still here but that is far from that
[36:26] now
[36:28] and we know why
[36:29] i want to read from
[36:32] sorry you can't see this i'll just read
[36:34] it from here there are some that are
[36:35] bigger
[36:36] it just depended on how it pasted into
[36:39] the program
[36:40] so i want to talk about here in
[36:42] ephesians 6 18 so we're just going down
[36:44] a little bit from verse 12 and it says
[36:46] praying so i'm not going to cover the
[36:47] armor in this one but i'm going to the
[36:49] final in the seventh part of the armor
[36:50] which was praying always with all prayer
[36:52] and supplication in the spirit and
[36:54] watching there unto with all
[36:56] perseverance and supplication for all
[36:58] saints
[37:00] and for me
[37:01] paul that utterance may be given unto me
[37:04] that i may open my mouth boldly to make
[37:07] known the mystery of the gospel
[37:10] and this is what i want to hit just for
[37:12] which i am an ambassador he says so he's
[37:16] representing something
[37:18] he knows who he is
[37:20] he knows his identity
[37:22] he's not representing the pharisees no
[37:24] more he's not representing the herodians
[37:27] or some political thing he's he's an
[37:29] ambassador of the gospel
[37:32] and we are ambassadors of the gospel and
[37:34] our nation is behind us hallelujah amen
[37:38] hallelujah and so prayer is our greatest
[37:41] weapon
[37:43] in destroying these powers because the i
[37:46] was going to call this breaking our
[37:48] national spirit which is the natural one
[37:51] breaking it and so there is going to be
[37:53] at the the way we're looking at this is
[37:55] to actually break these things out of
[37:57] our life to identify it
[37:59] to show the two spirits in our own lives
[38:02] and preach i want to i want to preach
[38:04] faith to identify and shun the kiwi
[38:06] nature
[38:08] in favor of our eagle dove national
[38:10] spirit
[38:11] i'll show you later on as you know the
[38:13] lord has
[38:14] lots of different ways of of displaying
[38:17] his nature but you can see you've got
[38:18] the dove and the eagle and then you've
[38:20] got the lamb and the lion
[38:22] and it's like the there's the heavenly
[38:24] creatures and it's the most meekest and
[38:26] the most majestic and then you've got
[38:28] the meekest burn and the most majestic
[38:30] bird so he covers it all
[38:32] and that's god and that's our national
[38:34] spirit so you can have an eagle and it's
[38:36] too it's going to be too much on one way
[38:38] or you can have a kiwi and oh my that
[38:41] just goes bad altogether but you have
[38:44] now with our national spirit if there
[38:46] was a flag there would be a an eagle and
[38:49] a darva and a lion and a lamb amen there
[38:52] will be these natural nature attributes
[38:56] that would declare what the spirit is
[38:58] about what is our culture about what do
[39:01] what defines us
[39:03] in our heavenly culture
[39:05] and paul was proud to say i'm an
[39:08] ambassador of that
[39:10] i'm an ambassador of heaven i'm an
[39:12] ambassador of a greater national spirit
[39:14] and i and and and and for me
[39:17] and i pray that tonight
[39:19] we will be able to identify traits
[39:22] that we are that the devil uses in our
[39:24] lives to bring us down and to hinder our
[39:28] walk and to hinder our communication to
[39:31] hinder our fellowship with each other
[39:33] with god with ourself with the people
[39:36] out there
[39:37] you know these these things and so i
[39:39] just pray tonight if something touches
[39:41] your house or comes to your mind and
[39:44] it's like yeah that's me don't worry i'm
[39:45] not preaching at you
[39:47] amen we're preaching for you
[39:49] amen we're together in this because it's
[39:51] coming my way too amen well none of us
[39:53] are exempt from this you know why
[39:55] because we ain't got a body change yet
[39:57] there ain't no body change here and you
[39:58] got raised by normal like natural people
[40:00] well i got raised by natural people and
[40:02] they got raised by natural people and
[40:04] there's cultures and there's spirits and
[40:06] there's all sorts of things
[40:08] amen
[40:09] oh my let's continue on
[40:12] hallelujah
[40:15] romans 12 1.
[40:17] well well paul says sorry before i go to
[40:19] romans 12 100 ephesians 6 20 because i
[40:20] only got to the first line but it says
[40:22] for which i am an ambassador in bonds
[40:25] that there and i may speak boldly as i
[40:27] ought to speak
[40:29] and now in romans 12 1 it says i beseech
[40:31] you
[40:34] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[40:36] mercies of god that you present your
[40:38] bodies a living sacrifice
[40:41] and i want to get into something a
[40:42] little later
[40:44] and that work sacrifice is a great thing
[40:47] and and when we realize what climate
[40:49] we're in right now
[40:51] man you'll be willing to sacrifice all
[40:53] of it that would hinder you and last
[40:55] night every weight and the sin that
[40:56] that's so easily beset you know hold you
[40:59] back
[41:00] oh my
[41:01] holding back
[41:03] blockages things that would just hinder
[41:05] from such an expression where god is
[41:08] you're irresistible
[41:10] you know there's no stinking coming up
[41:13] and and mindsets the way you think you
[41:15] know god thinks very differently than us
[41:17] his thoughts are higher than our
[41:18] thoughts and so if we employ our
[41:21] parental
[41:22] thoughts
[41:23] or
[41:23] thoughts that we got from school or
[41:25] thoughts that came from our work mates
[41:28] or place or even what we've thought of
[41:30] and seen by the eyes out there and
[41:31] cultures and politics we it's not that's
[41:34] that's very much repulsive
[41:36] to the spirit of god it's like not even
[41:39] like it it's just it's just hard to deal
[41:41] with
[41:42] amen even though but god's gracious you
[41:44] know he will he will send something your
[41:47] way to identify what that is and he will
[41:50] provide you deliverance
[41:52] he will provide a way of escape
[41:54] there's a way of escape tonight
[41:56] there's a way of escape from that old
[41:58] religious mindset there's a way of
[42:00] escape from message false culture
[42:02] there's a way of escape from the kiwi
[42:04] spirit
[42:05] a way of escape tonight amen it's not
[42:08] simple it's not complicated it just it's
[42:11] it's it's the blood of jesus
[42:13] his blood is so powerful his blood
[42:16] speaks better things than that of abel's
[42:18] it's speaking tonight saying you can be
[42:20] free actually it's saying more than that
[42:22] saying you are free because it was
[42:24] finished at calvary sin was dealt with
[42:27] sickness was dealt with mental illness
[42:29] was dealt with all ailments all false
[42:33] lies were dealt with
[42:35] everything was dealt with because he
[42:37] is the way the truth and the life and
[42:39] there is a way for you to come into
[42:40] connection with him
[42:42] and he's the deliverer
[42:44] actually he is the abolisher of all
[42:46] death and all of its things underneath
[42:48] it he removes it all he's done it it's
[42:51] not something that has to happen it is
[42:53] finished
[42:54] it's absolutely done and this is the
[42:57] mindset and you know we hear this all
[42:59] the time preachers every preacher that
[43:01] would preach under inspiration will tell
[43:03] you this right and you think oh my i've
[43:05] heard this but i like it but it's got to
[43:07] become reality
[43:09] the way we think
[43:11] and it defies logic and it will bring a
[43:13] reproach to you
[43:15] if you continue to think this way
[43:18] you'll be called extreme radical i mean
[43:20] we already get called radical anyway so
[43:22] you might as well just go go go up with
[43:25] the ship of zion
[43:27] go up with the ship we're not going down
[43:28] with the ship it ain't sinking this
[43:31] ship's going up amen get on board get on
[43:34] board
[43:36] amen it's landed brother branham it's
[43:38] landed sister meter it's landed my whole
[43:41] mother it's landed oh brother blue it's
[43:44] landed all these people it's landed
[43:46] sister val it's landlords you get on
[43:48] board
[43:49] that's going amen
[43:51] hallelujah
[43:54] amen
[43:56] romans 12 1 did we get there yeah we did
[44:00] romans 12 2
[44:04] oh it's a living sacrifice holy
[44:06] acceptable unto god which is your
[44:08] reasonable service
[44:09] if you realize the climate we're in
[44:12] we
[44:12] you know this was way later but i'll
[44:14] just lay it now as a foundation we're in
[44:16] a war
[44:18] and you know in the time of war
[44:19] everything changes
[44:21] nations change if the nation goes to war
[44:24] you kiss your business production
[44:25] goodbye
[44:27] it's going to be making weapons it's
[44:28] going to be making all sorts of things i
[44:30] don't know maybe it might not now
[44:32] because they just push buttons now but
[44:33] whatever it used to be
[44:35] the whole nation changed everybody
[44:37] sacrificed everything the economy
[44:39] stopped everything stopped
[44:42] now i don't want to get extreme until
[44:43] you stop working and don't do anything
[44:45] but just go out there and tell everyone
[44:46] but
[44:47] you know we have to be balanced
[44:49] but in your heart and in the way you
[44:51] think it has to be like that
[44:54] you have to get the mind of christ on
[44:55] every matter
[44:57] we're coming to a climate now and the
[44:59] devil's got his nukes out he's got his
[45:00] guns out he's got everything out he he
[45:03] he's just it's a relentless thing now
[45:05] it's all the stops are out now it's not
[45:08] time just to go about living how you've
[45:10] always lived
[45:11] it's a time for sacrifice
[45:14] amen
[45:16] you know
[45:17] it's very nice to go have a nice day at
[45:19] work
[45:20] or a hard day at work
[45:22] whatever it may be
[45:23] and then when you get home you don't
[45:24] want to do anything you want to sit on
[45:26] the couch
[45:28] and just veg out well i don't do that
[45:30] but
[45:31] i mean i used to do that
[45:33] i used to do that and i would drink beer
[45:36] you know i'm sure a lot of men out there
[45:37] do that they do nothing after work
[45:40] and when they watch the tv
[45:42] and it just pumps them full of the stuff
[45:45] but that's not the calling that's not a
[45:48] holy calling for us
[45:50] there is a high and holy calling and you
[45:52] know what that is lord
[45:54] i've got free time what would you like
[45:56] me to do
[45:57] i'm here you know if you've got a family
[45:59] be a family man
[46:01] do family altar you know do something
[46:03] like this god
[46:04] this time you know we're in a serious
[46:06] time
[46:07] and we have to make the most of these
[46:09] moments that we have
[46:11] and you know the best thing to do is
[46:12] just to say lord i'm available
[46:15] lord what do you want me to do tonight
[46:18] amen that's it be available to god and
[46:20] he'll speak to you he'll tell you oh
[46:22] well you put something upon your heart
[46:23] he'll send somebody and you might not
[46:25] want to have fellowship that night but
[46:27] god sent them and you've got to have it
[46:30] that you're sacrificing
[46:31] you know it's important
[46:33] it's very important that we are
[46:36] submitted to the lordship of god and we
[46:38] are saying lord not my will but thy will
[46:40] be done i i'm going to present myself a
[46:42] living sacrifice upon your altar now
[46:45] watch this
[46:46] watch what happens in romans 12 and you
[46:48] should read the whole chapter because
[46:50] see the chapter of romans 12 is saying
[46:52] this is how it starts
[46:53] and then you will begin to understand
[46:55] what the will of god is and then what
[46:57] happens next is all he begins to talk
[47:00] about the gifts and the operation of god
[47:03] and this is what we all want we want to
[47:05] see the supernatural who wants to see
[47:07] the supernatural who wants god to take
[47:09] over your life so much that all you see
[47:11] is god
[47:13] physically now not just you know like
[47:15] memories or or like well it's a good
[47:17] feeling but actual material miraculous
[47:21] reality
[47:22] the presence of god
[47:24] that we enjoy so much will materialize
[47:28] you know it goes beyond an awesome
[47:30] experience in church and maybe the odd
[47:32] nice time when he comes down in prayer
[47:34] but it becomes to materialize and that
[47:37] is that comes with sacrifice
[47:40] now i'm not saying to become like a
[47:41] religious pharisee and go and just fast
[47:44] every day and do it in your own strength
[47:46] but
[47:47] it's the attitude of the heart
[47:49] and it's how you approach your day it's
[47:52] how you approach your life are you on
[47:54] the altar
[47:55] are you a living sacrifice tonight you
[47:58] know you all know because you see we
[48:00] have ideas and we want to do things and
[48:03] we've got plans
[48:05] but are those plans surrendered to god
[48:08] they may be god's plans for you you
[48:10] might have caught the the the wavelength
[48:13] of what god wants you to do
[48:16] but you have to surrender that because
[48:18] god can tune it
[48:20] he can tune your life
[48:22] and until you really get to that point
[48:25] where you're willing to say lord not my
[48:27] dreams not my ambitions but yours
[48:31] it's hard for you to go any further with
[48:33] god
[48:34] you can have awesome times your
[48:35] knowledge will increase because you're
[48:36] sitting under ministry and you'll go to
[48:38] these conventions and camps and have
[48:40] glorious times but your life will stay
[48:42] the same
[48:44] because you're not willing to surrender
[48:46] yourself as a living sacrifice upon the
[48:48] altar i'll just read it again
[48:50] the bible says it very easily by the
[48:52] mercies of god that you present your
[48:54] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[48:58] acceptable unto god which is your
[49:00] reasonable service hey man that's like
[49:02] it's just reasonable
[49:05] i don't know what's that
[49:07] that's just average
[49:09] i mean it will come forth but more will
[49:11] come that's the beginning is a
[49:13] reasonable thing
[49:15] come and let us reason together
[49:17] you know i've got a better plan for you
[49:19] than you got
[49:20] that's what that's basically what god
[49:22] will is inferring me i'm inferring
[49:25] you know god's got a better plan
[49:27] our plans might be nice and we've worked
[49:29] it all out and we've got all these
[49:30] things sussed out what we're going to do
[49:32] short term midterm and long term
[49:34] but actually god's got a better plan
[49:37] he knows you built you he built the
[49:39] heritage of your whole natural spiritual
[49:41] and he created your soul
[49:43] don't you think he knows a bit better
[49:46] he knows what to plea he made you so
[49:48] that whatever he calls you to do it's
[49:50] gonna fit better than a hand in the
[49:52] glove
[49:53] it's gonna fit so well and you'll be
[49:55] satisfied you'll feel fulfilled
[49:57] because you're right in the center
[50:00] of what he's made you for me
[50:02] oh my
[50:03] he made you
[50:05] that way
[50:08] hallelujah
[50:09] now the reason i'm saying this is
[50:11] because we need to escape out these
[50:12] national spirits
[50:14] and these national spirits uh
[50:17] i mean you know i don't want to like
[50:18] sound all doom and gloom but you know
[50:19] they're just they're just everywhere
[50:22] they're everywhere and they're going
[50:24] there they you
[50:26] so they can find your your weak points
[50:29] and then they'll use that as leverage
[50:31] against you and your and the people
[50:33] around you and they try everything and
[50:35] until you escape that and to get
[50:37] dominion over that and lay a sacrifice
[50:40] of your life on the altar you'll be
[50:42] affected by that
[50:43] in multiple ways
[50:45] and so therefore if you it's actually
[50:48] far easier
[50:49] long term
[50:51] to just surrender
[50:53] absolutely submit and say lord even the
[50:56] stuff i don't know what i need to submit
[50:59] i just give that to you too
[51:00] and lord if there's anything and you can
[51:02] pray that i pray that all the time lord
[51:04] if there's anything in my life
[51:06] that i'm holding on to that i've gripped
[51:09] by my own will oh god
[51:12] you know we
[51:14] we're so
[51:15] we need him
[51:17] that light you know and you know you
[51:18] might be having a hard week and you
[51:20] think what's going on are you praying
[51:21] just wait and then he reveals it to you
[51:27] and what seemed so small
[51:29] and didn't you might have passed it off
[51:31] as just
[51:33] not really
[51:34] you know not even uh worth thinking
[51:36] about became the very reason why you had
[51:38] the bad week
[51:39] and it might not be anything major just
[51:41] might be a certain thing that happened
[51:42] or didn't happen and god showed you
[51:45] you were meant to do that
[51:47] or you you had that attitude there
[51:50] you know obviously the more you get
[51:51] closer to god the more he becomes you
[51:53] become tuned in and the more he expects
[51:56] from you in the way that you conduct and
[51:58] carry yourself
[52:00] if you walk far from god you know you'll
[52:01] he'll deal with you in a different way
[52:04] he'll bring you back
[52:06] you're always he wants he wants intimacy
[52:08] but to get intimacy you've got to start
[52:10] somewhere
[52:11] you know you've got to start somewhere
[52:14] start with a complete surrender
[52:17] start with being willing to just lay it
[52:18] all down
[52:20] amen you know and it's not something
[52:22] we're not catholics here you don't have
[52:23] to get on your knees with some beads and
[52:24] crawl up the steps 400 steps not even
[52:27] seven steps
[52:29] just one step
[52:31] and that is here i am lord
[52:34] absolute surrender amen so that we can
[52:37] escape
[52:38] this national spirit so and not just
[52:41] escape it we're going to defeat it
[52:43] we're not running from nothing you're
[52:45] meeting the devil
[52:46] and you're toeing the line actually
[52:48] don't even get off your toes
[52:50] you know brother branham said this
[52:52] now you know a fighter
[52:54] they
[52:55] if you're fighting and you're trying to
[52:57] fight you never go on your heels
[52:59] that's just i mean there might be some
[53:01] moves but when you're boxing you're on
[53:04] your toes
[53:05] and if you go if you're off your toes
[53:07] you've lost
[53:09] your ability and agility and dexterity
[53:11] and and you're just slow now see like if
[53:13] i go they can push you over but if
[53:15] you're on your toes you're ready you
[53:17] know and
[53:19] brother branham said that we must be on
[53:21] our toes
[53:23] don't get off your toes
[53:25] be on red alert
[53:28] for the devil against the devil
[53:31] because that's this is an age and i tell
[53:33] you we're in war and in the time of war
[53:35] you'll be willing if you recognize the
[53:37] war
[53:38] you know you won't you it won't be a
[53:40] problem it won't be a problem because
[53:43] you begin to see sin as it really is
[53:50] romans 12 2 it says and be not conformed
[53:52] to this world but be transformed
[53:55] by the renewing of your mind
[53:58] that you may prove what is that good and
[54:00] acceptable and perfect will of god
[54:04] amen amen
[54:07] i want to read from romans 1 20 to 23.
[54:09] it's so funny ben preached on all of us
[54:11] and i wasn't even i didn't even know i
[54:13] was going to be preaching until monday i
[54:14] think or early in the week
[54:16] and
[54:18] i didn't know what and i was just
[54:19] praying and then i got to this and i
[54:21] started reading
[54:22] this about national spirits i was like
[54:25] man every scripture is basically what
[54:27] ben used on sunday
[54:29] and i thought man i better put a
[54:30] disclaimer there and i'm not like oh i
[54:32] better just take these scriptures
[54:35] oh my i mean we're all guilty of doing
[54:36] that sometimes because it blesses you so
[54:38] much you know you want to go man i could
[54:40] just
[54:40] i love that you know and you get an
[54:42] inspiration from a certain scripture but
[54:44] this was already here
[54:46] and this is where the lord led us so
[54:48] amen he's obviously just revisiting his
[54:50] own scriptures for us but this thing is
[54:53] here tonight we're not going to so much
[54:56] hit
[54:57] the um
[54:58] the reasons per se
[55:00] but we're going to hit something here
[55:01] and i just want to read it because
[55:03] i believe that it's very important for
[55:06] us to realize that
[55:08] though we may be filled with the holy
[55:10] ghost then we may know god who knows god
[55:13] can you say you know him amen i know god
[55:17] now that doesn't give you an exemption
[55:18] from what's about to be read
[55:21] you can still be lured
[55:23] into things and and and become
[55:25] identified with the wrong things
[55:27] and if you really you know the more you
[55:29] get identified with something the more
[55:30] you materialize it the more you become
[55:33] it
[55:34] and to the point where you know it says
[55:37] in in him we're not going to go too far
[55:38] into it but god will give gave the world
[55:41] over to different degradations of their
[55:44] mind
[55:44] and their mind became darker and darker
[55:47] and darker until they were so far from
[55:48] god that they became beasts
[55:52] that they became identified with animals
[55:55] dirty filthy animals
[55:58] a man and a woman
[56:00] that was made in the image of god
[56:03] now
[56:04] that's on a major lay a big level but
[56:06] we'll read it
[56:08] but it can happen on a smaller level on
[56:10] an individual level and actually what we
[56:12] read here is comprised of individuals
[56:15] it's not just we look at stuff and think
[56:17] oh it's a big general thing but actually
[56:19] they were real people that and watch
[56:21] this
[56:22] they i'll just read it
[56:24] so i want you to be careful what you
[56:25] represent
[56:27] what what are you an ambassador of when
[56:30] people see you at work
[56:32] what are you representing
[56:34] what's materializing in your life
[56:36] what's the actions
[56:38] how do you react and
[56:40] and what do you do
[56:42] hallelujah
[56:44] what ambassador are you
[56:46] what's behind you
[56:48] because you what you do with these
[56:50] members what you yield them to us to the
[56:52] servant whom you are
[56:55] and therefore an ambassador no wonder we
[56:58] get so caught up sometimes and confused
[57:01] and things because this hand is doing is
[57:03] serving of the devil in the sand serving
[57:05] god
[57:06] and it's just like oh
[57:08] this is where amnesia starts to break
[57:09] down
[57:10] and then the devil gets you real down
[57:13] because you get amnesia because you're
[57:14] the help between two opinions and your
[57:16] mind becomes unstable
[57:18] hallelujah but remember we heard there's
[57:20] a stabilizer
[57:22] amen hallelujah
[57:24] and i believe that we were greatly
[57:26] stabilized was it sunday
[57:29] we were greatly stabilized you see we we
[57:31] hear stuff you know what the word
[57:34] we're an entrance is ministered you know
[57:37] so when you hear
[57:39] preaching
[57:40] and something is like an opportunity
[57:43] you know it's an entrance
[57:45] and it's ministered and you can take
[57:47] that leap you can take that plunge it
[57:50] was it's mixed with faith and and you
[57:53] can go into that thing that was being
[57:55] preached
[57:56] and you then you can walk into it and
[57:58] then apply it and now you're ready to
[58:00] fight because you're going to fight
[58:02] you're going to stand toe and you're
[58:04] going to toe the line with the devil and
[58:05] you're going to come at you and you're
[58:06] going to give him a hiding
[58:08] you know you guys are just a bunch of
[58:10] devil beaters amen giving him a hiding
[58:13] hallelujah why and how through a holy
[58:16] sanctified consecrated life
[58:18] that's done by god's grace because you
[58:20] reacted to an opportunity that was
[58:23] ministered to you or god came down into
[58:26] your bible study or your prayer in the
[58:28] morning you gave them something to work
[58:30] with
[58:30] you know we're going to give something
[58:32] god something to work with
[58:34] you because of grace will will take you
[58:37] into that thing that you want that from
[58:39] god
[58:40] and you express that and then grace
[58:42] comes and it and it makes it reality
[58:44] therefore the actions and what happens
[58:46] what's materialized in your life
[58:50] you're an ambassador of the gospel
[58:53] and you've got heaven behind you if
[58:55] you've got heaven behind you and that
[58:57] devil comes crying at you and trying to
[58:59] tempt you you can just give him such a
[59:01] hiding amen
[59:03] i've said this so many times but when i
[59:06] first got saved the devil was always
[59:08] hounding me in my memories
[59:10] and the lord gave me a tool
[59:12] the lord
[59:13] showed me that i if i get attacked
[59:16] in my mind with mind battles and heaps
[59:18] of thought to pray
[59:20] for somebody
[59:21] or to text them i think what the texts
[59:24] were back in their old days they all
[59:25] buttons you know so i was like
[59:30] to try and get one word out
[59:32] [Music]
[59:33] man we did it hard you know
[59:35] at least it wasn't the old bone that
[59:37] went round like that but
[59:39] we did it pretty difficult back then
[59:41] oh my
[59:44] oh man so but it actually disarmed the
[59:48] devil because every time he got me and
[59:50] he was hounding me all of a sudden some
[59:53] out where else there was atomic bombs
[59:55] going off
[59:56] amen do you know you've got the button
[59:58] to let atomic bombs go
[1:00:01] spiritual atomic bombs
[1:00:03] when you get tempted if let's say you
[1:00:05] make a stand tonight and you stand
[1:00:07] against whatever's troubling you or some
[1:00:09] spiritual thing that's identified and
[1:00:11] you say no more
[1:00:13] and and the devil's telling you yes
[1:00:14] there's going to be more you say no
[1:00:16] and he and you walk out of there and
[1:00:18] he's hounding you and he's at you you
[1:00:20] just start praying for somebody
[1:00:22] you just start glorifying god
[1:00:24] this is war
[1:00:27] this is this is why you expect that it's
[1:00:29] going to happen
[1:00:30] you're going to get delivered and the
[1:00:32] devil's going to try and undeliver you
[1:00:34] he's not going to give up
[1:00:36] he just sieges and sieges you and you
[1:00:38] know who knows what a siege is
[1:00:40] it's like a city that's defending itself
[1:00:42] and it doesn't have it can't go out and
[1:00:44] fight because it's not big enough so it
[1:00:46] defends itself and the bigger army just
[1:00:48] waits there and starves them until they
[1:00:50] give up
[1:00:51] and die of starvation and then they just
[1:00:53] take it
[1:00:56] you know that's what the devil tries to
[1:00:57] do in our lives
[1:00:59] he tries to get you
[1:01:01] to give up
[1:01:02] and live with those things
[1:01:05] even though you don't like them and they
[1:01:06] just stay there like tributaries in the
[1:01:09] land and they pay you tribute
[1:01:12] they're in there
[1:01:13] and they're just constantly there and
[1:01:14] you just think well i'll just take a
[1:01:16] you know i'll just i'll i'll just live
[1:01:18] with that
[1:01:19] and it might be something that comes at
[1:01:21] you all the time
[1:01:22] and you just live with it
[1:01:24] and it might be a sickness
[1:01:26] it might be something and it's a devil
[1:01:28] don't ever think oh i've dropped this
[1:01:30] and it's from my family or it's this and
[1:01:31] that's the devil
[1:01:33] the devil is responsible for it and
[1:01:35] jesus is responsible for removing it and
[1:01:37] he removed it
[1:01:39] it's dealt with and so if you're getting
[1:01:41] attacked by something and it comes back
[1:01:42] at you and it keeps coming back and you
[1:01:44] just go to the you just take you cloud
[1:01:46] it out with painkillers or or you go to
[1:01:49] some psychiatrist or whatever and and
[1:01:51] you just think you know what it's easier
[1:01:53] just to do that isn't it well actually
[1:01:55] i'll tell you what long term is not
[1:01:58] long term it's not going to get anywhere
[1:02:00] it's going to stay the same or degrade
[1:02:02] but you have a fight in you and i just
[1:02:04] pray that you will never give up
[1:02:06] that wherever it comes you just say no
[1:02:09] that's it i'm praying it might sound
[1:02:11] silly i've prayed it over and over but
[1:02:12] this time
[1:02:14] this time deliverance is sure
[1:02:16] this time i'm taking all
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] i shall have all
[1:02:22] this my inheritance perfect health is my
[1:02:24] inheritance who believes that jesus
[1:02:26] dealt with sin
[1:02:28] did you know when he dealt with sin he
[1:02:30] dealt with all of his attributes
[1:02:32] it's all finished it's all done
[1:02:34] therefore if you get sick it's just a
[1:02:36] lie
[1:02:37] actually really it's symptoms you see
[1:02:39] the symptoms and you see what's going on
[1:02:41] but actually really the devil is lying
[1:02:44] he doesn't have a right to keep you
[1:02:46] there
[1:02:47] and if he does it means you need to
[1:02:49] repent of something because you've got
[1:02:51] some sin going on or something's
[1:02:52] happening and or or there's an unbelief
[1:02:55] or there's a cloud or there's a blockage
[1:02:56] or you're going through a job you need
[1:02:59] to discern your your body you know
[1:03:01] discern the lord's body you know that's
[1:03:02] your body is the lord's body right
[1:03:05] it's not just your body it's the lord's
[1:03:07] you need to discern that
[1:03:09] what's going on in there lord what's
[1:03:11] happening to me why am i going through
[1:03:13] this lord show me jesus show me why i am
[1:03:16] having this
[1:03:17] he will show you
[1:03:19] he will show you
[1:03:21] but i tell you now
[1:03:22] you don't have to live
[1:03:24] and i and i just encourage you
[1:03:26] and if anyone's on that tape out there
[1:03:29] i encourage you
[1:03:31] don't ever let the siege
[1:03:35] bring you down
[1:03:36] to weaken you to the point where you've
[1:03:39] ascribed yourself to live with whatever
[1:03:40] the devil's handing you
[1:03:42] actually i was something came and i'll
[1:03:44] read it
[1:03:46] which is about that
[1:03:48] this is what i was just i just
[1:03:50] yeah
[1:03:51] never ever ever give up fighting
[1:03:54] even if the siege has gone on so long
[1:03:58] and the enemy thinks he's got you
[1:04:00] and you've begun to compromise and that
[1:04:03] you'll live with it what the devil is
[1:04:05] handing you don't do it you're a son or
[1:04:08] daughter of god you are free and there
[1:04:10] is a resounding jubilee for you
[1:04:13] it's constant
[1:04:15] the jubilee sounded and the one that
[1:04:18] gave and gives is the jubilee is here
[1:04:20] amen to abolish everything until death
[1:04:23] itself
[1:04:24] is abolished you know that he's come to
[1:04:27] wrap it all up he's just come to finish
[1:04:29] it all hallelujah it's all gonna it's
[1:04:32] all getting finished
[1:04:34] every devil every member
[1:04:36] every enemy everything
[1:04:38] all
[1:04:39] he's leaving no stone unturned
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] all those stones that you know we're
[1:04:44] like living stones and they might be
[1:04:46] buried in muck
[1:04:47] you might find yourself covered in moss
[1:04:49] the effects of your past
[1:04:51] and the enemy says can that live and i
[1:04:54] say yes
[1:04:55] and god says yes
[1:04:58] you might find yourself slimed over
[1:05:00] or beaten or broken but it shall be part
[1:05:03] of the temple it shall be part of god's
[1:05:05] glorious crown you've you he's not
[1:05:08] finished amen
[1:05:11] that was way at the end but i just read
[1:05:13] it there because it came up so
[1:05:16] i'm not being very behaved of these
[1:05:17] slides
[1:05:18] ah
[1:05:22] be careful what you represent and sow
[1:05:24] into because you can take on wrong
[1:05:27] spirits
[1:05:28] you know we can take on human spirits
[1:05:30] and that's how you take on national
[1:05:32] spirits you take on human spirits and
[1:05:34] the devil's very crafty on how he does
[1:05:36] it and if you get so entangled upon the
[1:05:38] affairs of this life and you get caught
[1:05:40] up in all these theories and politics
[1:05:42] and all of that you are on dangerous
[1:05:44] ground for becoming you know
[1:05:49] what's the opposite of benefactor but
[1:05:50] you are becoming part of that
[1:05:52] and that's starting to affect your life
[1:05:54] and influence you
[1:05:55] negatively
[1:05:58] even like this this government you know
[1:06:02] and i'm thankful for our country
[1:06:03] naturally speaking because it's not a
[1:06:05] hard country to live in
[1:06:07] but
[1:06:08] the way that they're operating now when
[1:06:11] it comes to they're just handing money
[1:06:13] out do you know that makes people that's
[1:06:15] just it actually weakens people's
[1:06:17] resolve
[1:06:18] because they begin to buy into this like
[1:06:21] this is actually not that hard you know
[1:06:23] i begin to go oh i could do some with
[1:06:25] some more of that so you begin to apply
[1:06:28] and you get more money given to you
[1:06:30] and maybe you can sit around and not do
[1:06:32] anything it's actually an act of war
[1:06:34] and it actually works on the it works on
[1:06:37] the maternal and paternal instinct
[1:06:40] of of your mind
[1:06:41] until you can feel like that's like a
[1:06:43] parent to you and it's if you're not
[1:06:45] careful you can actually the government
[1:06:47] can become your parent you know that
[1:06:49] you become like like you become
[1:06:51] dependent
[1:06:53] but we shouldn't be dependent on the
[1:06:54] man's government
[1:06:55] we should we should respect the
[1:06:57] government
[1:06:58] respect the government give caesar what
[1:07:00] caesars but don't let that become your
[1:07:02] mama
[1:07:03] don't let auntie cindy be your mom
[1:07:06] amen hallelujah
[1:07:08] oh my
[1:07:10] or your dad amen
[1:07:12] whatever don't let that happen you know
[1:07:15] god is our father we are a royal seat of
[1:07:17] abraham amen actually you know what we
[1:07:19] own this place
[1:07:21] this is all our house
[1:07:23] amen co-ed is with christ this is who
[1:07:25] you are you're an ambassador of the land
[1:07:28] that you really own they think they own
[1:07:30] it and they've got temporary
[1:07:32] they've got like a temporary deed
[1:07:34] but really the title deed you've got
[1:07:36] that straight from the hands of the
[1:07:38] creator oh my did he come down to you
[1:07:41] who came down to you
[1:07:43] who what did he hand you i like having a
[1:07:45] bible down in here this looks like this
[1:07:47] looks like a man's bible
[1:07:49] sorry a man
[1:07:53] why did he come down what did he give
[1:07:56] you
[1:07:57] oh my he gave you the word and he gave
[1:08:00] you the ownership
[1:08:02] he said i'm going to be coheir with you
[1:08:04] i'm coheir with you and i'm coming down
[1:08:07] you you know this this is a picture i
[1:08:09] love so much we read in revelation 10
[1:08:11] and we talk about revelation 10 7 which
[1:08:13] was brother branham's message and he
[1:08:15] faithfully sounded the mysteries and
[1:08:17] everything god done through him but the
[1:08:19] personal touch
[1:08:21] upon the whole thing
[1:08:22] john who you are typed with was called
[1:08:25] to take that from the hand of god
[1:08:27] himself
[1:08:28] not from brother branham we're not
[1:08:29] following a man and worshipping a man
[1:08:32] we're not called to take this book out
[1:08:33] of brother branham's hand if we do we'll
[1:08:35] just become branhamites but i don't
[1:08:37] believe i'm speaking to brandomites
[1:08:39] tonight i believe i'm speaking to mrs
[1:08:41] jesus christ
[1:08:42] who's been called to take it from his
[1:08:44] hand
[1:08:45] a personal touch
[1:08:48] personally hand it to you marian john
[1:08:50] ben all of you
[1:08:52] he invites you he says come and take it
[1:08:56] and eat it become one with it let this
[1:08:59] be an ambassador
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] represent this
[1:09:04] and be patriotic about it hallelujah
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:09] come to such a place where you recognize
[1:09:12] who you are
[1:09:13] and when you come into a place
[1:09:16] you know god is in that place
[1:09:19] god is in that place and i'm not talking
[1:09:21] about this flesh
[1:09:22] i'm talking about christ in you
[1:09:25] and and really he's going to redeem you
[1:09:27] it's still going to look similar
[1:09:29] maybe there won't be so many rolls or
[1:09:31] wrinkles but
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:34] but you will look similar
[1:09:36] and that's you and you're part of him
[1:09:38] you're his family
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] and so it's time
[1:09:42] to expose
[1:09:44] the devil
[1:09:45] and then when he's exposed and you can
[1:09:48] see
[1:09:49] how he's infiltrated you can see it you
[1:09:51] can just say no no that's not me
[1:09:53] and i'm going to lay those things aside
[1:09:55] i'm going to lay my life down because
[1:09:56] this is actually a war and we're in a
[1:09:59] war and when a war you just don't sit
[1:10:01] back
[1:10:03] hey man
[1:10:04] now you can i like my sofa
[1:10:06] i can have a good relax you know i'm
[1:10:07] good at relaxing and you need that but
[1:10:10] i'm not saying but i'm meaning your life
[1:10:13] if you look at your life and you sing
[1:10:14] think back over the last six months of
[1:10:16] your life
[1:10:17] if it's just predominantly couch and
[1:10:19] work
[1:10:20] and there's been no real action
[1:10:22] well you should reassess your life
[1:10:25] you should really there should be
[1:10:26] hallmarks of god's
[1:10:28] glory amen
[1:10:31] and i tell you it's not it's not some
[1:10:33] complex thing
[1:10:34] it just means surrender
[1:10:36] this is this is why i read romans 12 1 2
[1:10:39] lay your life on the altar
[1:10:41] so that he can renew your mind so you
[1:10:43] can begin to think the way he thinks
[1:10:46] that he's first
[1:10:48] in your thinking
[1:10:49] and he by his grace and his mercy begins
[1:10:52] to renew your mind and then if you
[1:10:55] continue reading romans 12
[1:10:56] 12 it begins to talk about the life
[1:10:59] expressed it talks about there's
[1:11:01] inspiration of the supernatural then it
[1:11:03] talks about the natural but yet
[1:11:05] supernatural life of a christian
[1:11:07] and that nature that love that dove and
[1:11:10] lying lamb and eagle
[1:11:12] manifesting in you
[1:11:14] to what does it do it continues to take
[1:11:17] you from glory to glory
[1:11:19] but if you hear the word and you enjoy
[1:11:21] it but you don't act upon it
[1:11:23] and there's no real action that just
[1:11:26] puts you in a stalemate
[1:11:28] there has to be an application
[1:11:31] and the application is god will place on
[1:11:33] your mind
[1:11:35] put that on my altar
[1:11:37] are you willing
[1:11:39] who's willing
[1:11:40] you know just to lay it all so you can
[1:11:42] have his glory and have his love and
[1:11:45] have his grace
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:50] i remember being first saved man i was
[1:11:51] so zealous to give everything over i
[1:11:54] just so wanted to surrender all and i
[1:11:56] did
[1:11:57] am i i mean you know you only surrender
[1:11:59] what you notice surrender as you go on
[1:12:01] and he begins to take you through the
[1:12:03] processes you begin to realize wow you
[1:12:05] know
[1:12:06] i'm still on a journey
[1:12:08] and you kind of on the journey as he
[1:12:10] unfolds it to you and he begins to show
[1:12:12] and he puts his hand upon things and
[1:12:14] puts his finger on things and he begins
[1:12:15] to change everything about you
[1:12:18] till you reflect him
[1:12:20] till you you know you go through trials
[1:12:22] you go through hardships and you come to
[1:12:24] a point you know and you there's a hot
[1:12:26] there's milestones and you walk with god
[1:12:29] milestones and things happen and and you
[1:12:31] might think oh it's just a small thing
[1:12:33] but to god it's a big thing heaven's
[1:12:35] rejoicing
[1:12:36] oh no you know that we're part of a
[1:12:38] family that's waiting for us
[1:12:40] and they're not complete without us and
[1:12:43] they're gunning it
[1:12:44] and they're saying come on
[1:12:46] let's do this
[1:12:48] on your toes bride of shekinah
[1:12:49] tabernacle on your toes
[1:12:52] don't give up
[1:12:54] hallelujah it might seem look impossible
[1:12:56] in the mountains all around you but
[1:12:58] don't give up just keep fighting just
[1:13:00] keep fighting just take that sword and
[1:13:02] cut that devil feel like you're
[1:13:04] repeating yourself just cut him in again
[1:13:07] just keep cutting
[1:13:08] just keep cutting
[1:13:10] don't give up because the devil
[1:13:12] you're going to be when he's all gone
[1:13:14] you're still going to be there
[1:13:15] you know that when he's all finished
[1:13:18] you have endured because christ in you
[1:13:22] hallelujah
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:34] i didn't even read romans 1 20.
[1:13:38] romans 1 20 says for the invisible
[1:13:40] things of him from the creation of the
[1:13:42] world are clearly seen
[1:13:45] being understood by the things that are
[1:13:46] made
[1:13:47] even his eternal power in godhead so
[1:13:49] that they are without excuse
[1:13:52] because that when they knew god
[1:13:55] now that's what i've underlined because
[1:13:57] this is the key to this one at the angle
[1:13:59] that i'm taking when they knew god so
[1:14:01] these people knew god
[1:14:03] they knew him
[1:14:05] my you know this changes the whole thing
[1:14:08] they knew god and we know god
[1:14:11] they glorified him not as god
[1:14:14] neither were thankful
[1:14:16] but became vain in their imaginations
[1:14:18] and their foolish heart was darkened
[1:14:22] this is a serious thing saints
[1:14:24] and if you le if you just get back on
[1:14:26] your heels and sit back and let the
[1:14:27] devil run amok in your mind and you just
[1:14:30] begin to entertain yourself with the
[1:14:31] devil and with his things you watch
[1:14:34] and it may be just small things it may
[1:14:36] it's just feeding the wrong thing what
[1:14:38] happens is you begin to go down the
[1:14:40] wrong path and it begins to separate you
[1:14:44] even though you know god
[1:14:46] this was a door for the world and these
[1:14:49] people that knew god it took them out
[1:14:53] it was a gateway out of god's economy a
[1:14:56] gateway from a glorious experience
[1:15:01] and there is a gateway open
[1:15:03] that's a path that leads to destruction
[1:15:05] and it's wide and it's hungry and hell
[1:15:08] is enlarging itself
[1:15:10] to try and take people
[1:15:12] and try and woo them out
[1:15:14] but tonight
[1:15:16] i encourage you
[1:15:17] don't
[1:15:18] ever give up
[1:15:20] on fighting against that
[1:15:22] however you might fail and fail and fail
[1:15:24] but just never give up
[1:15:26] get back up and
[1:15:28] toe the line
[1:15:29] total i say not
[1:15:31] this today
[1:15:32] right now is my deliverance right now is
[1:15:36] my healing right now is my baptism of
[1:15:39] the holy ghost right now i'm going to
[1:15:41] cross over jordan hallelujah
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:47] but because you see this world here if
[1:15:49] you continue reading says when they knew
[1:15:51] not god they glorified him not as god
[1:15:53] neither were thankful
[1:15:55] but became vain in their imaginations
[1:15:56] their foolish heart was dark and
[1:15:57] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:15:59] became fools and changed the glory of
[1:16:01] the uncorruptable god into an image made
[1:16:04] up like corruptable man and to birds and
[1:16:06] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[1:16:09] and so you see they begin to worship
[1:16:11] those things then you watch if you
[1:16:14] continue reading which we're not going
[1:16:15] to do tonight but that they physically
[1:16:19] became identified with the things that
[1:16:20] they worshipped
[1:16:22] and they became beasts and they
[1:16:24] corrupted the man's mind and corrupted
[1:16:27] down degraded until they were identified
[1:16:30] as beasts
[1:16:32] and you know god is not
[1:16:35] afraid
[1:16:36] to teach
[1:16:38] kings like nebuchadnezzar who was proud
[1:16:42] and he began to
[1:16:44] lift himself up you know what happened
[1:16:47] god gave him a mind of a beast and he
[1:16:49] was for however many years seven years
[1:16:51] he was an animal in the field
[1:16:54] so you can see now that's an extreme
[1:16:55] example but what i'm trying to get to
[1:16:57] here is that you can get caught up in a
[1:17:00] national spirit and you can become to
[1:17:02] take on the attributes of that animal
[1:17:04] that beast that bird and i want to tell
[1:17:07] you now the national spirit of new
[1:17:09] zealand is a kiwi
[1:17:11] and if you get caught up under the
[1:17:13] dominion of that domain which you're not
[1:17:15] meant to because you're above it it's
[1:17:17] under your feet you know that
[1:17:20] the national spirit of new zealand is
[1:17:22] under your feet
[1:17:25] completely defeated
[1:17:27] but you can begin to ascribe and you can
[1:17:29] begin to believe those things and get
[1:17:30] caught up in the politics of it and you
[1:17:32] can and actually in your flesh will
[1:17:35] beget actually has traits of it already
[1:17:38] and you need to overcome those things
[1:17:41] by the grace of god
[1:17:43] overcome these traits
[1:17:46] hallelujah
[1:17:48] 2 corinthians 11 3
[1:17:53] it says here but i fear paul says by but
[1:17:55] i fear lest by any means as the serpent
[1:17:57] beguiled ethereustility so your mind
[1:18:00] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:18:02] that is in christ for if he that cometh
[1:18:04] preaches another jesus whom we have not
[1:18:06] preached or if ye receive another spirit
[1:18:10] which we have not received or another
[1:18:11] gospel which we have not accepted you
[1:18:13] might well bear with him you see we're
[1:18:16] not exempt
[1:18:17] from receiving other spirits or
[1:18:19] connecting with other people you see you
[1:18:21] have to discern the lord's body you've
[1:18:23] got to discern what's going on in your
[1:18:25] life you need to discern actually there
[1:18:27] was a tongues and interpretation in one
[1:18:29] of the meetings i think it was allowed
[1:18:31] to see in church age and a man stood up
[1:18:33] and he prophesied in that meeting and he
[1:18:35] said take guard of your heart
[1:18:37] and i thought wow that's a really
[1:18:40] gripping statement take guard of your
[1:18:42] heart
[1:18:43] don't let these narratives and don't let
[1:18:45] these spirits discern it
[1:18:48] and you think why do i do this
[1:18:50] why is this thing keep surfacing in my
[1:18:52] life where does it come from and you can
[1:18:54] trace it back it's not of god well then
[1:18:56] where does it come from it's from an
[1:18:58] identity of the natural it's an
[1:19:00] unnatural identity and it's something to
[1:19:01] discern and it's something to get
[1:19:03] dominion over it's something to get
[1:19:05] deliverance from it's something to say
[1:19:07] you know i'm not letting that thing rule
[1:19:08] over me amen i'm not going to let the
[1:19:11] devil do those things in my life i'm not
[1:19:13] going to be identified with that because
[1:19:15] i am an ambassador of god's glory i'm an
[1:19:18] ambassador of heaven and i represent
[1:19:20] hallelujah
[1:19:22] the people of the book
[1:19:24] i represent an open book i represent an
[1:19:26] inheritance of love and grace
[1:19:29] hallelujah
[1:19:30] i don't come into a room and it
[1:19:32] escalates into something it de-escalates
[1:19:34] amen it's an atmosphere
[1:19:38] hallelujah
[1:19:43] our national spirit
[1:19:45] naturally speaking
[1:19:49] here we are we're here we've arrived
[1:19:52] at what it is and there's probably more
[1:19:54] things but these are the things that
[1:19:55] popped out to me
[1:19:56] this is the kiwi spirit
[1:19:59] tall poppy
[1:20:01] i thought that was that's the main
[1:20:03] that's the worst one
[1:20:04] oh my tall puppy
[1:20:06] okay it's for you for those of you that
[1:20:08] it's fresh in new zealand this might be
[1:20:09] a really good um session for you but
[1:20:14] you tall puppy it's not it's a spirit
[1:20:17] that's in new zealand that's
[1:20:19] non-supportive of others who are rising
[1:20:21] up in favor or are different
[1:20:24] that have something that is um
[1:20:27] prodigy you know like something that's
[1:20:29] that's
[1:20:31] in somebody god's gifted something or
[1:20:34] and it's a great thing
[1:20:35] it in the natural now a natural new
[1:20:38] zealand person that would that they it's
[1:20:40] everyone gets skeptical
[1:20:42] and there's skepticism and there's like
[1:20:44] all this you know like a narrative
[1:20:46] against it
[1:20:47] and and and there's accusations of pride
[1:20:50] and all of these different things
[1:20:52] that's the tall poppy the next one
[1:20:55] is she'll be right
[1:20:57] and this is a real
[1:20:58] man
[1:21:01] i mean we're we're getting somewhere you
[1:21:02] know
[1:21:03] we're getting somewhere
[1:21:05] she'll be right this is unkempt
[1:21:07] relationships and situations and leaving
[1:21:09] things to fester and just it's just
[1:21:12] carelessness
[1:21:13] right this is these are traits now i'm
[1:21:15] just going to read them out i'm not
[1:21:16] going to go too far into them uh the
[1:21:17] next one false modesty and humility
[1:21:21] due to tall poppy pressure
[1:21:23] so
[1:21:24] there is a pressure
[1:21:27] for new zealanders
[1:21:28] to not do anything special
[1:21:31] and if they do
[1:21:32] they they don't want to do it
[1:21:34] and there's a lot of gifted people
[1:21:36] whether in church or out of church
[1:21:37] whatever that don't express their gifts
[1:21:40] because they don't want to come across
[1:21:41] as being proud
[1:21:42] or
[1:21:43] being better than anyone else and it's
[1:21:46] not about being better than anyone else
[1:21:48] but people should be true to the grace
[1:21:50] that's given them
[1:21:51] and i'll get to it rivalry
[1:21:54] revelry vile i mean this is a huge one
[1:21:56] in new zealand revelry the the spirit of
[1:21:59] revelry who knows what the spirit of
[1:22:00] revelry you know what is revelry rivalry
[1:22:03] is just drunkenness and celebration of
[1:22:07] just nothing
[1:22:09] crazy and i was part of that
[1:22:11] a long time ago and many many like a
[1:22:14] life ago
[1:22:16] and and then the huge
[1:22:18] spirit of sport in new zealand
[1:22:20] but revelry vile sport fanaticism and
[1:22:23] you know what as i was writing this this
[1:22:25] came it is due to a suppression of
[1:22:27] religious joy
[1:22:28] did you know that the reason that
[1:22:30] there's so much degradation in society
[1:22:33] is the failure of the church
[1:22:35] it's the failure of those that should
[1:22:38] have been preaching an entrance all
[1:22:39] these thousands of years
[1:22:41] and ministry went into a nicolaitan
[1:22:43] spirit and the human beings went away
[1:22:45] from it they couldn't get it they lost
[1:22:47] contact and so now hello people who can
[1:22:51] bring joy back
[1:22:53] amen ministry that can minister an
[1:22:55] entrance and you can go higher and
[1:22:57] further and deeper
[1:22:59] we have it
[1:23:00] we're under a fountain of god's river of
[1:23:02] pleasure you know that he's got a river
[1:23:04] of pleasure for you amen he's got a
[1:23:07] river of pleasure for you brother paul
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:11] hallelujah and and and you know this is
[1:23:14] why it says because of iniquity
[1:23:17] the love of many shall wax cold
[1:23:21] and the iniquity is can only happen in
[1:23:23] the church
[1:23:24] because they're the ones that knew they
[1:23:26] were doing it
[1:23:27] and it pushes the spirit of god away
[1:23:29] they begin to do things of their own
[1:23:31] will they were not willing to lay a
[1:23:33] sacrifice
[1:23:35] on the altar so that god's will could
[1:23:37] manifest but here we are
[1:23:40] restored
[1:23:41] god's will is being manifested tonight
[1:23:43] god's will is being manifested here
[1:23:45] under this vision that god began
[1:23:48] amen and we are beneficiaries
[1:23:51] of an outlet
[1:23:53] amen you know that there's an outlet
[1:23:55] here in wellington god has got an outlet
[1:23:58] hallelujah he's got an oasis
[1:24:00] amen an oasis where he can bring people
[1:24:03] joy
[1:24:04] bring people deliverance bring people
[1:24:05] peace bring people a relationship bring
[1:24:08] people a rapture amen bring people a
[1:24:11] family amen that can be closer than your
[1:24:14] natural family you know that
[1:24:17] our spiritual family
[1:24:19] can be closer than our natural family
[1:24:22] and we want our natural family to be our
[1:24:24] spiritual family too right and some of
[1:24:26] you are blessed with that but i i can
[1:24:28] tell you now
[1:24:29] that spiritual family if your family is
[1:24:31] not spiritual family but
[1:24:33] your spiritual family is
[1:24:34] very close compared
[1:24:41] because of common ground
[1:24:42] we all believe the same thing and we've
[1:24:44] got this vision together you know we're
[1:24:46] of one mind
[1:24:48] anyway i'll carry on we'll never get
[1:24:50] through it emotional suppress oh sorry
[1:24:52] rivery via sport fanaticism due to
[1:24:55] suppression of religious joy
[1:24:57] formalism
[1:24:58] as a flightless bird
[1:25:01] oh mate
[1:25:03] emotional suppressiveness
[1:25:05] that's too you know these are some of
[1:25:07] the words that will be used that's too
[1:25:08] deep
[1:25:09] men don't cry
[1:25:11] stoic just suppressing emotion
[1:25:15] you know too ashamed to express emotion
[1:25:18] and they wonder why there's so much
[1:25:19] suicide in new zealand
[1:25:21] that's why
[1:25:22] because then people aren't able to
[1:25:23] express their emotion for shame for
[1:25:26] feeling embarrassed about it
[1:25:29] break it
[1:25:30] if you are an emotional suppressant
[1:25:33] and you struggle with it
[1:25:35] just ask god tonight to heal you
[1:25:38] to heal you so that you can really
[1:25:40] express emotion
[1:25:42] that's very important for your mental
[1:25:44] health
[1:25:45] so important
[1:25:46] stock unable to communicate
[1:25:49] these are traits of in new zealand
[1:25:51] unable to communicate unable to talk and
[1:25:54] have a good heart-to-heart conversation
[1:25:55] without getting upset
[1:25:57] you know
[1:25:58] i have them with people and you want to
[1:26:00] talk real deep stuff you know like i
[1:26:01] mean when i say deep i don't mean
[1:26:02] doctrinally deep i mean like
[1:26:04] rudimentary social
[1:26:06] stuff that's like real weighty
[1:26:10] and people get upset
[1:26:12] man
[1:26:13] they fire up it's so interesting you
[1:26:15] know like when we've had lots of
[1:26:16] brothers and sisters that have come here
[1:26:18] to new zealand from well africa as well
[1:26:20] particularly and because a lot of
[1:26:22] africans have come here and they can't
[1:26:23] understand
[1:26:24] how new zealanders are so
[1:26:27] closed in emotions and closed and not
[1:26:29] conversation and just not accountable to
[1:26:32] each other but when you go over to these
[1:26:34] other places everyone knows everything
[1:26:35] about everybody and it's easy to connect
[1:26:39] and if you if you are talking like this
[1:26:41] is a big one
[1:26:42] you can have a conversation with
[1:26:43] somebody and they're happy as and really
[1:26:46] they're thinking completely opposite now
[1:26:47] that's new zealand
[1:26:49] they're thinking i can't wait for this
[1:26:50] conversation to end
[1:26:52] i want this guy out of my house
[1:26:56] and that's what they're thinking but
[1:26:57] they're just happy as and they're just
[1:26:58] answering and asking you questions come
[1:27:00] on have you do you know that this is the
[1:27:03] new this is a typical this is extremely
[1:27:05] typical but it's typical and it happens
[1:27:08] and this is this is the new zealand they
[1:27:10] and it's an i think it comes from the
[1:27:11] english
[1:27:12] this is an english thing it's very
[1:27:13] everything's done by hints everything's
[1:27:15] done subtly and subtle hints no one just
[1:27:18] says what it is
[1:27:19] they're just like come on just tell me
[1:27:22] let's just be real and i pray that us as
[1:27:24] a as a church family we can just be real
[1:27:27] and we're not ashamed of who we really
[1:27:28] are
[1:27:30] don't put your hand up i'm gonna warn
[1:27:32] you but is anyone ashamed of who they
[1:27:34] are
[1:27:35] you know no one don't be ashamed of who
[1:27:37] you are
[1:27:38] because
[1:27:39] you see we're all a work in progress
[1:27:42] god begun something in you
[1:27:44] god started something in you
[1:27:46] philippians 1 6. if anyone wants to read
[1:27:49] that write that down and you can read
[1:27:51] that later
[1:27:52] that's a promise to you
[1:27:54] of philippians 1 6
[1:27:56] and i want you to read that but i want
[1:27:58] you to think about something god did for
[1:28:00] you it doesn't matter how small
[1:28:02] he started something amen and that means
[1:28:05] he's going to finish it he's faithful
[1:28:07] who believes god's faithful tonight oh
[1:28:09] isn't he faithful i want to sing that
[1:28:12] song you know you are faithful
[1:28:14] every day
[1:28:15] every hour
[1:28:17] oh my he's so faithful to me
[1:28:20] oh my
[1:28:21] the last one here now now please i know
[1:28:23] there's probably so many more but
[1:28:26] we don't have all night so self-reliance
[1:28:30] is a huge one in the kiwi culture
[1:28:32] where we rely on our own ability
[1:28:35] we rely on our ingenuity and we're known
[1:28:37] around the world for ingenious
[1:28:39] like creations and ideas and just this
[1:28:42] whole drive
[1:28:43] because such a small country it's like
[1:28:45] the small country syndrome you know
[1:28:46] but yet within there there is
[1:28:49] god you know he's created this country
[1:28:51] and it's the uttermost part of the earth
[1:28:54] and it's the first country to see the
[1:28:56] sun based on the time system that that's
[1:28:58] been created
[1:28:59] and so you can see there it is a special
[1:29:02] place but we should never rely on
[1:29:04] ourself
[1:29:06] we should never think i've got to do
[1:29:08] this i've got this you ain't got it i
[1:29:11] ain't got it oh my he's got it you know
[1:29:14] he's got it not you we ain't got it
[1:29:17] and the moment we can just surrender
[1:29:18] that do you know when you really believe
[1:29:20] that it's when you lay your life a
[1:29:22] living sacrifice on the altar because
[1:29:24] you realize i haven't got this
[1:29:26] and and that's where that you begin to
[1:29:29] find the will of god for your life
[1:29:31] right there
[1:29:32] key
[1:29:33] there's a key there
[1:29:36] the attributes of a kiwi bird oh my
[1:29:40] yeah man you know i'm not much of a you
[1:29:42] know like there are brothers that will
[1:29:44] research and they'll get you all the
[1:29:45] deepest things and lots of it when it
[1:29:47] comes to the stuff but i just found one
[1:29:49] article and it was enough
[1:29:51] [Laughter]
[1:29:53] oh my
[1:29:55] i mustn't be the most i love studying
[1:29:57] the bible but when it comes to studying
[1:29:59] that stuff out there oh my makes me
[1:30:01] tired
[1:30:02] tiny wings
[1:30:04] so they've got tiny little wings i'm not
[1:30:06] going to be identified with that okay
[1:30:08] they freeze when they're distressed
[1:30:11] if i get distressed i'm going to run
[1:30:12] towards the enemy
[1:30:14] if the enemy challenges you don't run
[1:30:16] back
[1:30:17] you know what you do you run forward
[1:30:19] because guess who's going to step in for
[1:30:21] you you might not even know what's going
[1:30:23] to happen but it's going to be good for
[1:30:24] you and it's going to be bad for you for
[1:30:26] the devil
[1:30:27] the enemy going down because you're
[1:30:29] running towards him and who's in you
[1:30:32] amen oh my
[1:30:33] who's in you so when you when you might
[1:30:36] and you might get something happen to
[1:30:38] your good tonight
[1:30:39] because you gave had faith and you said
[1:30:41] i'm gonna take that
[1:30:42] and then you get out there and the
[1:30:43] devil's waiting to toe the line but
[1:30:45] you're on your toes and when he comes at
[1:30:47] you you run towards him
[1:30:49] and you give him the biggest hiding he's
[1:30:51] ever got
[1:30:52] oh yeah
[1:30:53] oh my
[1:30:55] hallelujah feathers malt oh yeah
[1:30:58] so they're always losing you know a
[1:30:59] deciduous tree
[1:31:01] we're not called to be deciduous who
[1:31:03] knows what deciduous means is that still
[1:31:05] taught or is that an old word i'm fairly
[1:31:07] old
[1:31:08] it's a tree that loses its leaves
[1:31:10] hey
[1:31:11] we don't want to be a seasonal tree amen
[1:31:14] do you know if you're planted by the
[1:31:15] river of life you're always green always
[1:31:18] fruitful
[1:31:19] amen there's seed in you
[1:31:22] real life and people eat this the fruit
[1:31:25] amen it says you're a wholesome
[1:31:28] part of god part of his word the proverb
[1:31:31] says a wholesome tongue is a tree of
[1:31:32] life
[1:31:33] he says i am the vine you are the
[1:31:34] branches
[1:31:35] therefore you you bear fruit for him
[1:31:38] because you're planted
[1:31:40] because you've got an em you realize i'm
[1:31:41] an ambassador like paul i'm an
[1:31:43] ambassador for heaven i'm an ambassador
[1:31:45] of christ i ain't representing no
[1:31:46] flightless bird that gets distressed and
[1:31:49] freezes and gets petrified oh the enemy
[1:31:52] and you're sitting in church you know
[1:31:53] what you know no one's gonna say oh that
[1:31:56] certainly is bad when they hear you cast
[1:31:57] out the devil
[1:31:58] in church i've had to cast out the devil
[1:32:00] many times
[1:32:01] because he's coming at me in church
[1:32:03] he comes at you in church because he
[1:32:05] thinks oh they can't say anything so i'm
[1:32:06] gonna just get them and it ruins the
[1:32:09] atmosphere around you
[1:32:10] and then the next person can go man i
[1:32:12] feel negative what's going on that
[1:32:13] person brought a battle to church
[1:32:15] but you see now you can go you know i
[1:32:17] heard something tonight and and the
[1:32:19] enemy might be hounding me in my pew but
[1:32:21] i'm gonna just stand i'm gonna say devil
[1:32:23] i bind you
[1:32:24] i claim this you know this is my this is
[1:32:27] god's temple and he might be hounding at
[1:32:29] you in god's temple that's not that's
[1:32:32] not his
[1:32:33] it might be fallen it might be but god's
[1:32:35] willing to be inside that you know that
[1:32:38] we think of our flesh as something so
[1:32:40] far gone and it's uh but really god is
[1:32:42] willing to go in there
[1:32:44] you know that he's willing to live in
[1:32:46] that he's willing to wash dishes with
[1:32:47] you he's willing to stand with you he's
[1:32:49] willing to go to school with you he's
[1:32:51] willing to go through it all with you in
[1:32:53] you therefore i think he's jealous over
[1:32:56] that body because it's his temple
[1:32:58] that's his
[1:33:00] he's jealous
[1:33:02] you know we think he's kind of forsaken
[1:33:04] the body but actually he he actually
[1:33:06] lives inside it therefore he's looking
[1:33:08] he wants you to look after it and be a
[1:33:10] faithful steward of it
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:13] hallelujah
[1:33:16] so i'm not going to be identified with
[1:33:17] that
[1:33:19] so i just i read these things and you
[1:33:20] think you know what if i feel if there's
[1:33:22] anything that's been said now that i'm
[1:33:24] like and you think oh my
[1:33:26] and i've oh my
[1:33:28] on these things
[1:33:29] because we are
[1:33:31] we have to be honest
[1:33:32] and if you're honest you can get
[1:33:34] deliverance or you have honest you can
[1:33:36] let's not say it might not be like in
[1:33:38] need of some sort of like demonic
[1:33:39] deliverance but like i'm talking about
[1:33:41] uh
[1:33:42] just it's just the fact that it gets
[1:33:44] exposed and it's just a habit or
[1:33:46] something you learned from your parents
[1:33:48] or something that you that you and that
[1:33:49] was in your inherent uh genes and it's
[1:33:52] like oh i've i realize no that's that
[1:33:55] then tonight don't walk out with it
[1:33:58] you see this is where the mind needs to
[1:34:00] change
[1:34:01] deliverance is not some time lock thing
[1:34:04] it's not something you have to grovel to
[1:34:05] god about and it can happen right now
[1:34:08] if you see it and god says you know what
[1:34:10] it's time
[1:34:13] it's time for you to just walk in their
[1:34:15] liberty because now you realize oh wow
[1:34:17] that yep i i've done that or that's
[1:34:20] happening to me i need to walk out of
[1:34:22] this and tonight don't just walk out of
[1:34:24] the church walk out of that
[1:34:26] dysfunctional habitual whatever it may
[1:34:29] be
[1:34:30] males incubate eggs instead of the
[1:34:31] mother so you see now in kiwis it's
[1:34:34] turned around
[1:34:36] so there's this whole confusion now you
[1:34:37] could say
[1:34:38] if you're going to attribute
[1:34:43] yourself to a kiwi bird the males
[1:34:46] incubate the eggs instead of the mother
[1:34:49] you know but it's it's usual in the
[1:34:52] as a son of god
[1:34:53] that we don't
[1:34:55] do
[1:34:55] the mother
[1:34:57] maternal instinct you know there's a
[1:34:59] divide there is a clear balanced
[1:35:01] definition between a mother a male and a
[1:35:03] female and god loves definition and so
[1:35:06] we don't want to be caught up in a
[1:35:08] confusion of male and female definition
[1:35:12] now we don't want to take that to the
[1:35:13] extreme and go you know what i'm a man i
[1:35:16] ain't never going to wash no dishes i
[1:35:18] ain't never going to cook no eggs you
[1:35:20] know i don't think that that's what it
[1:35:22] means and i think that people that do
[1:35:24] that take it to the extreme we should be
[1:35:26] part of this as a co-equal team you know
[1:35:29] we we we do our children together we do
[1:35:31] these things together but there are
[1:35:33] times and places where we need to know
[1:35:36] that clear demarcation between a male
[1:35:38] and a female and and realize you're
[1:35:41] positioned sons of god and realize
[1:35:43] you're positioned daughters of god
[1:35:45] because you are built for that and
[1:35:47] there's an anointing to be released upon
[1:35:49] your life to fulfill that in its glory
[1:35:54] it's an anointing you know like every
[1:35:55] office that god calls a human being to
[1:35:58] his anointing come for it to power
[1:36:01] empower that
[1:36:02] so that it can happen right
[1:36:04] and we just need to tap into that
[1:36:06] nocturnal
[1:36:08] creatures of the night
[1:36:09] poor eyesight
[1:36:11] now
[1:36:12] who's going to choose poor eyesight over
[1:36:14] eagle vision
[1:36:15] i ain't going to choose no poor eyesight
[1:36:17] i'm not going to be identified with no
[1:36:19] kiwi bird
[1:36:20] who's going to be identified with kiba
[1:36:22] in no way who wants to be identified
[1:36:23] with an eagle bird amen the higher you
[1:36:26] fly amen the more you see
[1:36:29] amen because you've been raised up on
[1:36:31] eagle's wings amen god sent you a
[1:36:34] prophetic message to raise you up on
[1:36:36] eagle's wings to take you to himself
[1:36:38] amen you know he said that to israel he
[1:36:40] said to moses and he says i've taken you
[1:36:43] on eagle's wings and brought you to
[1:36:44] myself and i'm going to put you in a
[1:36:46] wilderness experience and to take you
[1:36:47] into the land
[1:36:49] amen and that's what god is doing for us
[1:36:51] he take us out of egypt on eagle's wings
[1:36:54] to himself take you through the
[1:36:56] wilderness willing to walk with you
[1:37:00] willing to
[1:37:01] to call you a brethren
[1:37:03] willing to say you're my bride
[1:37:05] god who's willing that
[1:37:07] to say
[1:37:08] i love you
[1:37:10] i care for you i care for your body i
[1:37:12] care for your spirit and i care for your
[1:37:13] soul
[1:37:14] not just your soul
[1:37:16] it's not neglect all three
[1:37:18] parts because each part has a part to
[1:37:21] play
[1:37:23] you need to be balanced
[1:37:25] in all areas of your life
[1:37:27] if your your soul gets redeemed but if
[1:37:29] you neglect the other two you're going
[1:37:31] to have a your experience is going to be
[1:37:32] dampened
[1:37:37] you know brother branham said you can be
[1:37:38] holy ghost filled and have a mental
[1:37:39] illness
[1:37:40] and be deranged in your mind
[1:37:42] you can get to such a point
[1:37:44] and that's why i'm speaking these things
[1:37:46] because what you ascribe to
[1:37:48] what you begin to take your affections
[1:37:50] onto what you begin to become patriotic
[1:37:53] for
[1:37:54] you know to be patriotic for something
[1:37:56] it means it's stolen your affections
[1:37:58] it's stolen your
[1:38:01] your concern
[1:38:03] it's it's taken a portion of your
[1:38:06] worship your attention because you're
[1:38:08] patriotic for it you're standing for it
[1:38:11] you've got like this drive to support
[1:38:13] that but really who's behind it
[1:38:17] because if it ain't heaven
[1:38:18] it's the devil
[1:38:20] might look like some good movement but
[1:38:22] really what is it where does it come
[1:38:24] from
[1:38:25] so we have to be careful and when you
[1:38:27] begin to ascribe to that what does it do
[1:38:28] it begins to confuse you bring you down
[1:38:31] and you wonder why your experience is
[1:38:32] the way it is
[1:38:34] is because of what you are attributing
[1:38:36] yourself to
[1:38:37] likely to lose its children
[1:38:40] that was a big one for me
[1:38:44] and i when i read this i thought wow
[1:38:46] did you know
[1:38:47] the success rate
[1:38:49] of a new birth in kiwis
[1:38:52] is five percent
[1:38:55] i'm gonna say a new birth because if you
[1:38:57] raise your children as a kiwi
[1:39:00] you're going to lose them
[1:39:01] and they're going to go into the world
[1:39:03] because there's no that kiwi spirit is
[1:39:05] designed to destroy families
[1:39:07] to separate fathers and sons to separate
[1:39:10] mothers and daughters to break it and to
[1:39:12] cause prostitution and to cause drugs
[1:39:14] and to bring people into revelry to
[1:39:17] bring people into an emotional
[1:39:19] emotionless stoic
[1:39:22] flightless situation
[1:39:24] but i'm gonna tell you that's not our
[1:39:27] representation
[1:39:29] hallelujah
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:32] hallelujah it's wartime saints and i've
[1:39:34] already touched on this so we're just
[1:39:35] going to fly through this one the
[1:39:37] climate and i want you to recognize the
[1:39:40] climate we're in is not just a time of
[1:39:42] peace
[1:39:43] out here
[1:39:45] the only peace is in here
[1:39:47] you've got perfect peace because your
[1:39:49] mind has stayed on him and he will keep
[1:39:52] you stable he will keep you steadfast
[1:39:55] unmovable when your life is on the rock
[1:39:57] and you see that's why it's so important
[1:39:59] for you to say you know what lord i give
[1:40:00] up
[1:40:01] i'm giving it all to you so that you can
[1:40:04] lead me in this troublesome time of war
[1:40:07] because there's no one else that can
[1:40:08] navigate this war
[1:40:10] outside of our jesus
[1:40:12] let me tell you about my jesus
[1:40:14] oh he's so good
[1:40:16] he knows the battle he's the five star
[1:40:18] general we're not no five star general
[1:40:21] hallelujah
[1:40:22] no minister no matter how great their
[1:40:24] message ministry may be or whatever
[1:40:26] there's no five star general only one
[1:40:29] and now prophet introduced us to him
[1:40:31] amen and when the work was done the
[1:40:33] prophet was taken and the firestar
[1:40:35] general just continued on hallelujah is
[1:40:38] continuing on he visited wellington
[1:40:40] hello you are beneficiaries of the
[1:40:43] general's visitation hello rahabbs who
[1:40:46] came out of prostitution came out of
[1:40:48] spiritual wickedness the captain came
[1:40:51] and found you he came and bowled down
[1:40:53] your walls so that you could be free so
[1:40:56] that you could come to marriage
[1:40:58] amen he saw you and he was willing to
[1:41:00] walk with you
[1:41:01] and out of egypt through the wilderness
[1:41:04] cross the jordan till you could come out
[1:41:06] of it all so you could come into
[1:41:08] connection and now he's still willing to
[1:41:10] walk with you all the way through to
[1:41:13] take you but you have to be willing to
[1:41:14] recognize that this is ain't no time of
[1:41:18] peace on earth
[1:41:19] there is only a sword and it's time to
[1:41:22] get on your toes saints don't give up
[1:41:25] don't live with that thing that's
[1:41:26] troubling you don't live with that
[1:41:28] headache
[1:41:29] and i'm talking minor things now don't
[1:41:30] live with that little thing that happens
[1:41:32] to you don't live with that little
[1:41:34] ailment in your shoulder or that ailment
[1:41:36] in your knees or whatever it may be you
[1:41:38] don't have to live with it
[1:41:40] you know we if we just live with
[1:41:42] everything that's easy that can be lived
[1:41:44] with when it comes to something major
[1:41:46] are you going to turn to god for that
[1:41:49] where is the lion
[1:41:51] do you just turn to god for the major
[1:41:52] things
[1:41:53] or do you trust god for everything
[1:41:55] amen hallelujah
[1:41:58] and god may lead you to the arm of
[1:42:00] medicine for healing but let him lead
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:04] whatever you do
[1:42:05] do it in faith
[1:42:08] don't do it in fanaticism or some
[1:42:11] like whim
[1:42:12] do it in faith
[1:42:14] and when you know the mind of god and
[1:42:15] when you're fully surrendered and he
[1:42:17] begins to share the mystery of his will
[1:42:20] you know that is what it is it's a love
[1:42:23] relationship

[1:43:52] this is where faith is and you if we go
[1:43:55] back into the revivals of the
[1:43:57] um
[1:43:58] of the 50s and 60s these faith
[1:44:00] ministries
[1:44:02] they just said
[1:44:03] this is what's going to happen
[1:44:05] and people believed it and it happened
[1:44:08] they just said it
[1:44:10] just touch this and you're going to be
[1:44:12] healed and millions of people got healed
[1:44:13] because they just no there was no doubt
[1:44:15] in that there was no question and that's
[1:44:18] what faith really is it doesn't question
[1:44:21] it is because god said it is you're
[1:44:24] healed because god said you're healed by
[1:44:26] his stripes you were healed there is no
[1:44:29] wriggle room do you know that there's no
[1:44:32] wriggle room
[1:44:34] you
[1:44:34] who's under the atonement
[1:44:36] is all healed
[1:44:38] and brother branham you know he says if
[1:44:39] we could just get
[1:44:41] that sorted there'll be not a feeble
[1:44:43] person in this room there will be not an
[1:44:45] ailment in this room and there'll be
[1:44:47] nobody that wants to get the holy ghost
[1:44:49] that won't get it
[1:44:50] right now
[1:44:54] it's how we think
[1:44:55] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:44:57] in christ jesus
[1:44:59] sorry i am going way over time
[1:45:06] i'm gonna read now okay we're just gonna
[1:45:08] finish in a sunday school
[1:45:10] type
[1:45:11] because i have to read it
[1:45:13] so please can i have five more minutes
[1:45:15] is that all right
[1:45:16] amen praise the lord i want you to think
[1:45:19] real spiritual now
[1:45:20] hallelujah i want the preaching to
[1:45:22] happen in your heart as i read okay
[1:45:24] we're not gonna go into anything too far
[1:45:27] so wartime do you realize the sacrifice
[1:45:30] of war we've touched on this sacrificing
[1:45:32] the old man to receive a renewed mind so
[1:45:35] that the new man can live
[1:45:38] look at the process of romans 12. go
[1:45:40] read it and look at the process it
[1:45:43] starts with the sacrifice it starts
[1:45:45] recognizing your day and its message it
[1:45:47] starts with recognizing the climate and
[1:45:49] saying i'm willing to take that altar
[1:45:51] that's been restored and i'm willing to
[1:45:53] lay my life down so that i can hear the
[1:45:55] voice of god and receive the mystery of
[1:45:57] his will for my life and then begin to
[1:45:59] live out a supernatural testimony
[1:46:03] we i you all put your hand up you want
[1:46:05] the supernatural so therefore say lord
[1:46:08] is there anything hindering it
[1:46:10] is there anything in my life that i'm
[1:46:12] not laying down because i don't want
[1:46:14] that i want to be fully in tune with you
[1:46:17] i want to have a renewal of my mind so
[1:46:19] that you can supernaturally operate
[1:46:22] through my life and i will when i see it
[1:46:24] happening a month i'm going to celebrate
[1:46:27] when god moves in my brothers and
[1:46:28] sisters
[1:46:29] i ain't going to be no tall poppy and go
[1:46:31] oh god's moving in there oh i wonder if
[1:46:33] that's the flesh oh you know that really
[1:46:36] destroys the atmosphere if god is using
[1:46:38] somebody uh this was later and we never
[1:46:41] got to it but i'll get to it now sorry i
[1:46:43] said i wasn't going to do this but it's
[1:46:44] just coming so if god starts to move in
[1:46:47] somebody and maybe you see and we're
[1:46:49] going to see it right because we've got
[1:46:50] children growing up and god's going to
[1:46:52] use them and he may use them in a
[1:46:54] greater measure than he uses us and
[1:46:56] we're going to celebrate it we're going
[1:46:58] to say amen i mean i love this i see
[1:47:02] that person came from sin and now
[1:47:04] they're greater than me hallelujah this
[1:47:06] is the attitude and we want to celebrate
[1:47:09] that we want to celebrate our young
[1:47:11] people
[1:47:12] god's grace is greater in them than it
[1:47:14] is in us some awesome gift manifested so
[1:47:18] i encourage you when we see it and we
[1:47:20] are seeing it and when we continue to
[1:47:22] see it make sure you celebrate it
[1:47:25] because god he it's
[1:47:27] he's saying to the church i'm giving you
[1:47:29] this
[1:47:30] this is me i'm gonna put my gift in this
[1:47:32] young boy this young girl and i'm gonna
[1:47:34] get glory and those in my church they
[1:47:36] love it you know what
[1:47:38] you celebrate that he'll give you more
[1:47:41] you know that
[1:47:42] you celebrate the one little gift or
[1:47:44] another he'll give you more you
[1:47:46] celebrate the supernatural operating
[1:47:47] there and there's no resentment or no
[1:47:49] funny stuff and you say oh praise god oh
[1:47:52] and you walk in that then he'll give
[1:47:54] more and he'll give it to you
[1:47:57] hallelujah if there's resentment the
[1:47:59] altar is open
[1:48:01] hallelujah
[1:48:02] we got it because there the altar is
[1:48:04] open for you to get healed of some
[1:48:06] national spirit called kiwi to poppy
[1:48:10] oh my lord jesus
[1:48:12] hallelujah
[1:48:13] this is just man we just because you
[1:48:15] know brother branstad a gift will not
[1:48:16] make itself known where it's not wanted
[1:48:18] you know that
[1:48:20] hallelujah and when a gift when the
[1:48:22] supernatural begins to operate
[1:48:24] do not think for a second the devil's
[1:48:25] going to try and stop her he goes for
[1:48:27] everything he knows what's going on in
[1:48:29] people's minds and he if the people
[1:48:31] begin to think oh i wonder if that's god
[1:48:33] or or that person's just thinking this
[1:48:35] and they're that and all this don't do
[1:48:37] that
[1:48:38] don't do it
[1:48:40] just cast that devil aside
[1:48:42] he doesn't want it to happen whenever
[1:48:44] you get a negative thought against
[1:48:46] anyone or anything like that it's not
[1:48:48] god
[1:48:49] it's the devil
[1:48:51] it's not you
[1:48:52] you're just a
[1:48:53] thought uh
[1:48:55] processor you ain't a thought generator
[1:48:58] you know that we don't generate thoughts
[1:49:00] in our own there's always a
[1:49:02] foundation for them they always come
[1:49:04] from an influence they come from a
[1:49:05] spirit they come from either god or
[1:49:07] satan
[1:49:08] hallelujah so you just have to be
[1:49:09] careful what you entertain and if it
[1:49:12] comes to your mind and you think oh
[1:49:13] that's negative you cast it out
[1:49:15] and then the holy spirit continues to
[1:49:17] flow the service goes up higher you know
[1:49:20] when god begins to move and the spirit
[1:49:21] begins to flow the devil's going to try
[1:49:23] everything to stop it and he's going to
[1:49:25] start firing negative thoughts in your
[1:49:27] mind or you just cast it aside throw up
[1:49:30] your hands and enter in
[1:49:32] you might feel nothing but enter in
[1:49:34] anyway because you can rejoice that that
[1:49:36] one is entering you can rejoice that
[1:49:38] that person is getting blessed get
[1:49:40] blessed for them and then you'll find
[1:49:42] that the spirit of god will come on you
[1:49:43] and you'll get blessed it's like a chain
[1:49:46] reaction
[1:49:47] amen don't just think there and this is
[1:49:49] the last thing you want to think
[1:49:50] everyone's getting blessed but not me
[1:49:53] oh the door doesn't like me that's just
[1:49:56] a devil
[1:49:57] you don't have to think that you just go
[1:49:59] you know what i don't feel very good
[1:50:00] right now but everyone else is feeling
[1:50:02] good so praise the lord amen and then
[1:50:04] someone begins to just go right off and
[1:50:06] through the roof amen you just rejoice
[1:50:09] hallelujah and things might happen that
[1:50:11] we don't understand
[1:50:13] you know because we haven't seen it
[1:50:14] before but just rejoicing god because
[1:50:16] the spirit of god amen
[1:50:19] you'll discern it
[1:50:21] perfectly working order hallelujah
[1:50:25] if so so the sacrifice
[1:50:27] ephesians 4 29 if so be that you have
[1:50:29] heard him and has been taught by him as
[1:50:31] the truthers in jesus that you put off
[1:50:33] concerning the former conversation the
[1:50:34] old man the kiwi
[1:50:37] put off the kiwi which is corrupt
[1:50:39] according to the deceitful lusts and be
[1:50:41] renewed in the spirit of your mind this
[1:50:44] is reflecting romans 12 1 and 2. the
[1:50:46] same thing
[1:50:47] let's put it off put it on the altar a
[1:50:50] living sacrifice amen which is a corrupt
[1:50:53] that just get rid of that let the fire
[1:50:55] come and consume that so that you can be
[1:50:57] renewed in the spirit of your mind so
[1:50:59] that these things god's grace begins to
[1:51:01] operate and begins to change your
[1:51:03] thinking and all of a sudden you're
[1:51:05] thinking kingdom thoughts you're
[1:51:06] thinking the way the king thinks because
[1:51:08] the king's got dominion in your mind
[1:51:10] because he's now able to live in and
[1:51:13] through you not you and him as a
[1:51:15] coalition there's no coalition we don't
[1:51:18] have a coalition with god it has to be
[1:51:20] god
[1:51:21] no coalition amen no winston peters
[1:51:24] calling the shots
[1:51:26] hindering the government
[1:51:28] oh my amen do you know that's what it
[1:51:30] really is if you're trying to rule in
[1:51:32] the coalition of god it's like winston
[1:51:34] peters you know he's in there and he's
[1:51:36] just causing his little spanner in the
[1:51:38] works
[1:51:38] god can't work with that
[1:51:40] he'll just work with you until you get
[1:51:42] to a point where he can take over
[1:51:44] amen hallelujah
[1:51:48] i don't mean to compare you to winston
[1:51:49] peters that's just a a crude example of
[1:51:53] what it must feel like to the lord when
[1:51:54] we're trying to do some of the ruling in
[1:51:56] our own life
[1:51:58] and we're not at that full state of
[1:51:59] surrender so that then it says it and
[1:52:02] that then here's the kind of icing for
[1:52:04] it and that you put on the new man which
[1:52:07] is after god is created in righteousness
[1:52:10] and true holiness
[1:52:12] so here is now
[1:52:14] the heavens national spirit so tall
[1:52:16] puppy is changed to all poppy
[1:52:18] amen we're all going up
[1:52:21] hey man we're all going in a rapture so
[1:52:23] it's not just one but if one starts
[1:52:25] growing and having a good time we just
[1:52:26] rejoice with them amen because we're
[1:52:28] coming too amen somehow we're going to
[1:52:31] be there too amen by his grace
[1:52:34] hallelujah
[1:52:35] we celebrate one another's exaltation
[1:52:38] regardless of the grace they get we
[1:52:40] don't compare ourselves with them
[1:52:42] because we're
[1:52:43] also under god's grace to come to where
[1:52:46] he wants us to be to exalt us under his
[1:52:48] mighty hand when we fully humble
[1:52:50] ourselves under his mighty hand he will
[1:52:52] exalt we are all exalted after death to
[1:52:54] self we shall glory in the exaltation of
[1:52:58] others if there is a problem there is
[1:53:00] still a death to take place in our own
[1:53:01] lives
[1:53:02] hallelujah then the next one that we
[1:53:04] want to do the opposite now i'm saying
[1:53:06] these things these are the opposite of
[1:53:08] the kiwi because you see sometimes
[1:53:10] habits are not demons they're just
[1:53:12] habits that you've done all your life or
[1:53:14] you've learned and you've just got to do
[1:53:15] the opposite they came to brother
[1:53:17] branham and they said brother branham
[1:53:19] i'm selfish and i just been prayed for
[1:53:21] every minister in the world i've had two
[1:53:23] buckets of oil on me in total and i'm
[1:53:26] still selfish what's wrong with me is it
[1:53:29] a devil and brother brown says no just
[1:53:30] do the opposite go and be unselfish go
[1:53:33] and make a point to go and do unselfish
[1:53:36] things go and give all your money to the
[1:53:38] poor go and do something that's going to
[1:53:40] completely change your mentality because
[1:53:43] it's just a bad habit that may be rooted
[1:53:46] deeply in your genetics and it needs you
[1:53:48] to take dominion over your own old
[1:53:50] nature and go and change it yourself
[1:53:52] that's the beauty of works
[1:53:55] so yes you're doing works and it's not
[1:53:57] but to earn anything but it helps you
[1:54:00] because it begins to train the old
[1:54:02] nature to realize that it's actually a
[1:54:04] benefit to you to be a glorious holy
[1:54:07] selfless person
[1:54:09] hallelujah
[1:54:10] so anyway opposites she'll be right
[1:54:12] becomes deep trust so instead of she'll
[1:54:14] be right neglecting things and and just
[1:54:16] keeping to yourself and keeping your own
[1:54:18] family never telling anyone anything
[1:54:19] about your problems and and and thinking
[1:54:22] and this whole she'll be right kiwi
[1:54:24] spirit now becomes this she'll be right
[1:54:27] it meant spirit becomes a deep trust in
[1:54:29] the local body
[1:54:31] no longer do we need to sweep our
[1:54:33] problems and private struggles under the
[1:54:35] rug no more false proclamation in place
[1:54:38] of transparency and trusting
[1:54:40] which is the biblical approach to
[1:54:42] bearing one another's burdens and
[1:54:43] detailing dealing with faults in each
[1:54:46] other's lives and love
[1:54:47] including our children and siblings amen
[1:54:50] so your children are not exempt
[1:54:52] you got to deal with each other and help
[1:54:54] each other and be transparent you see
[1:54:56] now it's not a case where we just go and
[1:54:58] sweep just ignore it
[1:55:00] we don't just want to ignore it it's got
[1:55:02] to be dealt with and when god puts his
[1:55:04] finger on something don't just ignore it
[1:55:06] don't just go you know what that's
[1:55:08] embarrassing this body is full of love
[1:55:11] this this family's full of love we can
[1:55:12] help you we can pray with each other we
[1:55:15] don't need to be ashamed of who we
[1:55:16] really struggle things that we struggle
[1:55:18] don't
[1:55:19] just just just have a deep trust that
[1:55:22] god has placed you in a family that
[1:55:24] loves you and cares for you
[1:55:25] amen false humility becomes meekness and
[1:55:29] trust in god
[1:55:30] amen
[1:55:32] discerning whose spirit we are taking on
[1:55:35] and projecting and this is my quote that
[1:55:36] i was going to read for the service it
[1:55:38] says and now many times we in churches
[1:55:39] this may seem strange but if you'll just
[1:55:42] watch it now this is for the church is
[1:55:44] for the people the people get one
[1:55:46] another spirit in the state of getting
[1:55:48] the holy spirit you go into a group of
[1:55:50] people you watch the way that person
[1:55:52] acts and then find people that come into
[1:55:55] that congregation the first thing you
[1:55:57] know they act the same way
[1:55:59] you you take a good woman and a bad man
[1:56:01] and he'll either he'll either become a
[1:56:03] good man or her a bad woman and the
[1:56:06] atmosphere that you live in you project
[1:56:08] to your associates is what you are
[1:56:11] then what type of people ought we to be
[1:56:13] if we're a christian
[1:56:15] what type of an atmosphere should we
[1:56:17] live in in this is the atmosphere now he
[1:56:20] says in a consoling
[1:56:22] soothing
[1:56:24] healing atmosphere
[1:56:25] we should live in with our hearts
[1:56:28] constantly in prayer
[1:56:29] with a deep love
[1:56:31] for every person we come in contact with
[1:56:37] lord help me
[1:56:38] lord help me
[1:56:40] make me like that lord because that is
[1:56:42] the spirit of christ
[1:56:43] hallelujah
[1:56:45] oh lord when i read that i thought my of
[1:56:47] lord here i am
[1:56:49] oh god i need your grace hallelujah
[1:56:53] amen
[1:56:55] our earthly culture received its boost
[1:56:57] in revelation 9 and all of the evil that
[1:57:00] came up out of hell
[1:57:01] then kiwi culture was
[1:57:03] flourishing and it's flourished under
[1:57:06] that devil anointing but our heavenly
[1:57:08] spirit national spirit was bolstered
[1:57:11] with the mighty angel coming down with
[1:57:12] the open book so you have now in your
[1:57:15] own life a meeting place of two
[1:57:18] powers
[1:57:19] and there's one power to bolster up the
[1:57:21] old nature and make that give it
[1:57:23] everything it wants layered to see and
[1:57:25] everything but then what you actually
[1:57:27] have to realize is and the the greatest
[1:57:30] visitation of god's presence has come to
[1:57:32] the earth personally to you to get your
[1:57:35] deliverance from it to get you changed
[1:57:38] from it to give you a way of escape in
[1:57:40] the time of trouble to take you and
[1:57:42] enrapture you and give you dominion
[1:57:45] completely and utterly totally delivered
