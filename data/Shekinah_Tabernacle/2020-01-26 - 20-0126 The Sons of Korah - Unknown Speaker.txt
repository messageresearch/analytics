things of God invite [Music] and divide our orgeous reaches up [Music] [Music] just obey [Music] five [Music] [Music] [Music] they [Music] come and [Music] come and come and die [Music] I mean you always get satisfied when you're down at the Lord's table brother Joshua I'm like a sheep when you like the shepherd bro when you lead I follow because you're all the words here you know you know it's interesting thinking of that concept about a shepherd because the Shepherd always knows things that the sheep don't know and it's the sheep's job to really just have faith and know that the Shepherd's intentions are good and that everything's all right even if it doesn't seem like it's all right or even if you can't see what's happening I just had a I've got a little funny story so there was we suspected there was somebody snooping around the home last night in the early hours like 1:30 and I said to Melissa I rang around 12 to us it rang Melissa and said do you did you hear that there was the Karen things and she said no I didn't but because we've definitely come past a house and she said I'm kind of scared you know like can you can you come down and you know look around so so mister survival man kicked into gear so I got my torches and this is not a miracle but I got my gun because hey you have to invite yourself you know you might come across three or four guys so I'm but I'm thinking like I'm not just gonna because he was deeply someone let me hit me right so I thought I'm not just gonna drive down in my care and like spoke four guys in like hey yeah didn't even know what they're up to you say so I thought I'll creep down oh well take my daughter so I hear them off and I'll just Creek down slowly down the drive with my handle you know it'd be like a stealth man so she's expecting me to turn up within about five minutes and you know hey everything's alright cuz she lives down the bottom right out in the country but I probably took about thirty minutes because I'm just sneaking down but all the time I could see your house and I'm always watching your house and I'm sneaking I stopped by what she has and I'm just checking there's no one around a house in there but she's and I'm thinking you know she doesn't know what I'm doing she's probably worried that I'm not gonna come and she's probably thinking oh we were see but she doesn't realize I'm watching a house the whole time it's alright you know I can see her house probably was from my position you know but she doesn't know that they know that's what I thought of the Lord you know often he's watching we don't know what's going on but he's watching he's got it all under control but everything was alright but the Lord's got everything under control I mean let's um let's think he's got the whole world in his hands see this is a different tempo please because the other one's a little bit boring for me he's got [Music] these gato [Music] lady [Music] he's got you and me brother [Music] he's got you [Music] and he's got to you [Music] he's got everybody here [Music] I everybody [Music] Oh [Music] he's got now Gatto [Music] he's got the he's got the waistband [Music] we've got the Sun

[Music] but I know my head believe it and I am persuaded [Music] to me [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] shot to the north and the south sing and the way Jesus shout to the north we were [Music] one more time shot to the north we were [Music] as what the great you know I saw [Music] yeah - the doll [Music] Prydz I'm Church [Music] well it's something by [Music] - fine [Music] find by the power we fall in deep we've been through fire we've been through five right [Music] that's the norm [Music] and chat to the north [Music] one more time we were to the north and the south [Music] East and the

their hands on them before the devil does we can put them in his hands I mean so it's a great privilege today to dedicate little Lena Caitlin mounted to the Lord you know I was thinking you know you're from different parts of the earth mr.chair other Kris and brother Brennan would say and the unveiling of God he'd say like a man building chimes or making chimes the molder each Bell has got a ring different from the other the same materials but so much I earn so much steel so much brass but to give it the ting hmm that's the way God did he breathed this one - that one - this one - that one - this one - that one until he got exactly what he wanted and I believe little eNOS got a special ting that the Lord wanted upon me with a special sound that she had to come by you but God had in his mind before the foundation of the world that she would be brought in this season now I was looking at her name I love the meaning of names I'm sure you've you know looked as well and the Lena we know it means light Caitlin means pure and mounta I was looking at the name mounter and it means of course a amount of hill but the suffix winner's attached to a topographical feature means the dweller at something so there's a the dweller at the mountain and I was thinking you know as Jesus would say in Matthew 5 yeah the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house that your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven and brother bran would speak of our future home he says in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom earthy bride he says now you've got the city see it's a holy mountain nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain say at the Lord the city is not a cube it's a mountain and the width by the breadth by the height that equal see 5th 900 miles away 1,500 miles that way 1,500 miles all around and 1500 miles high so it's a great mountain like the pyramid and the city is on the mountain he says glory so here's a dweller I believe she's going to be a dweller on the mountain I'm in that future home so I pray that she will be a pure light I know that's your heart desire to that she'll be the light of the world we need little ones to manifest this word as well it's not just old ones as little children they means I can a holder what a precious little one she is I mean this just bow he said a word of Prayer shall we gracious Lord Jesus dear Lord we thank you

words or anything please see brother heed Amen you know I mean son 46 and verse 1 and we're gonna read some 47 to some 46 this is the cenotes to the chief musician for the sons of korah a song unto LM month I don't know if that's me making that noise God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear through though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Selah there is a river the streams rough shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early Amy I'm glad about that timing the the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he added his voice the earth melted the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge Selah come behold the works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease into the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cut at the spear and Sunday he burn at the chariot and the fire be still and know that I am God I'll be exalted among the heathen I'll be exalted in the earth the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge Selah we'll just continue reading down this is again a psalm for the sons of korah o clap your hands oh you people shut unto the Lord with the voice of triumph for the Lord Most High as terrible he's a crate king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us Amen I'm so glad he choosen the excellency of Jacob whom he loved Selah God has gone up with a shout the Lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to God sing praises sing praises unto our God sing praises for God as the king of all the earth sing he praises with understanding we have understanding in the state God reigneth over the heathen he sitteth upon the throne of His Holiness the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the God of Abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto God he is greatly exalted I mean may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I want to I want to take a if I could title this I want to speak about removing the stigma of your past now now we know the word is eternal you know it speaks to all people all generations and you know all scriptures for reproof for doctrine for exhortation you know all Scripture is that but we but I want you to notice that that there's there's a few of the Psalms and they are directed to the sons of korah and God is wanting to show us something and this is not just God filling up ink on paper you know but there is a reason why they are directed to the sons of korah or for the sons of korah now the sons of korah we know kora was one that that would would raise up during when when Israel was going for in from Egypt into the Promised Land he he he rose up he was a man of renown and any and he rose up with with the young you know with Dathan and abiram and and the great princes and they rose up before moses and you know with certain of the children of israel now i'm reading number 16 two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly famous and the congregation men every now and this is core here here's a famous one in an israel he had great influence and something moved in his heart that he wasn't happy with god's provided way of god speaking directly through moses the Word of God to lead them into the Promised Land so because of his great influence they begin to speak among themselves and they had a better idea of doing it and whenever man has a better idea there's one thing for sure it's the wrong idea God is always right his word is always correct amen every time so they rose up and they they they rose up before Moses and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and they sit unto them you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lords so they were actually accusing them you're actually placing yourself in this position but God put them in that position and so sure the whole Congressional vote was holy because God was in their midst but God placed officers in Israel and Moses and Aaron happened to be the Prophet and the high priest they were placed in those offices so they were saying you've lifted yourselves up but of course they didn't God put them there and so now Moses yeah we won't continue reading but Moses basically said you know well God's going to show you whose side is on whose side and you know if God does a new thing and the earth swallows you up you'll know whose side their God is on and they separate themselves from them the earth swallowed them up and cut you and and they all perished and even Jude would speak about this is the gainsaying of korah so these gained sayings are men with a political spirit political mind rising up against the order of God trying to take control now this was Cora now the scripture says that that in numbers 26 and 11 notwithstanding the children of Korah died not so that Korah died but his children weren't caught up in this and this in this event but now imagine the stigma your daddy was now part of this rebellion remember in Israel lineage was everything they were the son of the son of whoever you know so lineage was everything so there was now a stigma attached to Cora's name so to be now a son of Korah what was then the father we know is passed down into the children so the same attributes are potentially now in the children so they carried that stigma with them now I remember when I was young maybe I was and Lisa Lily as age and my dad read us from the Bible when we read about the first murder on the earth of course Cain killed Abel and there was a little boy at my school I don't know if he is in my class but I the next day I went and told him you know you're named after the first murderer in the world I know I don't have much filter going on uh-huh I hope I got more of a filter now think before speak but you know imagine if he was I don't think he was a Christian or but imagine if he was a Christian he would have now a stigma attached to his name you mean I'm named after a murderer yeah there'll be a stigma attached to it so now there was a stigma attached to Korres name now we have a stigma attached to our past and the devil wants to hold our past against us it may not be what we've done maybe what we our parents have done maybe our grandparents whoever it may be but there's a stigma attached to sins that people have done and the devil wants to hold it against you to stop you coming into your god-given god-given place I mean we're going to understand our Lord has taken care of it all hallelujah so now know so the children of Korah died not with the gain things of their father but there was a great stigma you know associated with Cora's name you know so if I told some some kid at school he's named after a murderer how do you think they would have been in Israel oh you're the sons of Korah you know because imagine sitting there listening to the tour of being read and you are a son of Korah and I come into numbers think about the gang saying of core and what kora did there be a stigma attached to it you'd feel bad that you're called that way he followed me I mean so they would have been living under that condemnation but God don't want us to live under the condemnation of the past he wants us free of it I mean cuz if God don't remember why should we remember if God doesn't hold it against you why should we hold it against ourselves hallelujah so Cora now you know and and it's amazing the influence that Cora and Dathan had because after Moses said well you know if God do a new thing in the earth swallow you up and it did yet you keep reading God in numbers 16 it says in verse 41 but on the morrow all the Congress of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron because saying ye have killed the people of the Lord so they had that kind of influence upon the congregation even though God suppressed she said no that they're not speaking for me that people had a so twisted in their mind they were God's people that's how strong the influence was but now so here are these sons of korah living under this stigma for generations but there comes a time when the stigma does not remain that's why we read I you know that's why I pointed out to you that those these Psalms are written for the sons of Korah so God is taking God is taking David who's king he's anointed he's brucey placed in the body he would prophesy speaking first person of Calvary my God my God why self a sake admitted so moving his life he - he'd speak first person of future events like he was there he had began to prophesy things and they're still coming to pass and he would use God would use his lips I mean to address the sons of korah how they're to say now this this word that's being released now you're going to receive this song and you're going to be anointed I mean hallelu to sing forth the praise of God so what - what David did now no I'm gonna try and slow down we know that in this day we have journey through a wilderness the church came out of Egypt now are in the promised land but there was a wilderness journey there was fighting there was all things going on people wandering around lots of sins and things happening but now we're living in a new day where we're even Moses would tell the children of Israel and Judah enemy 29 and to me it's astounding he says that you know so Deuteronomy as 40 years they've been in the wilderness for 40 years they're about to go into the Promised Land and he tells us roll you saw the miracles God did in Egypt you saw everything he did for you yet God has not given you eyes to see your heart to perceive until this day so they walked with a pillar of fire they went across the Red Sea they were fed manner out of the wilderness they saw God come down on the on the tabernacle and all incredible things they saw God come down a Mount Sinai they saw all those things but yet God's but Moses say no you don't you didn't understand what was going on but now you do and you're about to go in holy and it's the same thing people in the message have been journeying for 40 50 years now but now God is causing the lights to turn on where it's more than quotes more than debates more than doctrine but a living reality of a living God and a people where people are now possessing their inheritance we're living in a different hour hallelujah so now so so to me now you know the message has always been the same but but I believe the potency of it the reality of it the potency of the word is so much more richer now because God's given us eyes to see we never did it in the first place where's the first place God's thinking I mean when he saw you before the foundation of the world when he would address Jobe in his trial where were you when I laid the foundations of the world the morning stars shouted for joy and guys trying to get job to see him to realize you were in my thinking you were there before before there's ever a molecule upon the earth you and me hallelujah and that's why when the Prophet said you never did it in the first place well where's the first place God's thinking of you before the foundation of the world I mean so if he saw me rejoicing hallelujah I want to manifest that Amen why should we you know I'm not gonna let a rock cry out in my place and it's not shouting for the sake of shouting it's shouting because of Revelation it's shouting because I'm free it's rejoicing because I'm a free person I mean this Liberty in this place how they should mean Liberty in our lives that we should be free to express ourselves how we feel - well you sound quiet well that's fine but don't resume the people who allowed you say I'm loud well don't resume the people who are quiet you should be free to express yourself how you want to express yourself because of its God doing it it's an order you know a Billy Paul Brandon would tell the story and I've said it before but there'd be a woman who had heard swung her handbag and bam tabernacle and she had throw it across the church when she got so excited I've never heard her tank where brother Brahim said stop that now sister that's wrong why cuz God was doing it you know their stories are y'all heard the other day brother brandman you know at the end of meetings you take his coat he'd swing it around and around and around rejoicing and he'd go outside and swing it around and around rejoicing oh my we got to have the right we are Free People amen what we should shout with the voice of triumph Kali we've got the victory we're on the victors side hallelujah amen so here they were now when David became King and the kingdom was established under David they possessed the fullness of the promised land they never possessed it in the days of Joshua they possessed all that was promised through Moses in the kingship of David so when the king came to the throne then they took the full inheritance and it's the same thing today through the church ages where your people have gained ground they've gained a possession but it's when the King steps forth and takes over there is no longer church ages but now it's the son of man I mean the king himself stepping into the church and taking over that's when the fullness of the inheritance of the word I mean we receive it hallelujah I mean under the days of Moses they didn't take all the way to the the review Freddie's so there was parts of the word that they didn't possess but then when David came to the throne any any way and he went in conquered there and he possessed it why because the king came to the throne and so now under David we had people coming into an adoption right David instituted the singers Institute a different temple worship even before there was the temple built he received the inspiration for the temple to be built but he began to put things in place that wins when Solomon would finally put the physical temple together everything was there that the worship could be instituted so under the kingship of David people came to their adoption the mighty men came to their adoption now adoption we know is placing in the body right so now the mighty men before David came to the throne they were just Gentiles they were just vagabonds destitute afflicted whatever they were and distressed tormented but then under the anointing that was on David they came to their position in the body right they came to their adoption just like the sons of Korah they had a stigma to their name I remember then David on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost God told him no take the sons of korah place them in the worship place them in a very influential place Amen we where their father could not be I mean I'm going to put the sons and I'm gonna put the sons in a show that the stigma attached to their name has been scrubbed off I mean that I don't see it no more I mean but now they are in their position hallelujah glory to go man that should make you real happy why does it make you feel happy because there was a stigma attached to our first nature amen sin was yeah we were born with sin nature we're born and darkness doesn't matter who you who you are what your last name is a man we must be born again there's got to be God's got to transform your life and change you so there's a stigma with our first birth with our first name but I remember when brother brems preached the first seal he says that you'll understand I no longer call the church but I call you bride why does he why are we no longer called church because there's a stigma associated with the name Church I mean with church there's a stigma off men's ideas man's dogma man controlling man all those different things going on hierarchy politics whatever it may be that's all associated with the name church they said I'm not calling you that name no more gonna call you bride you're under a different dispensation now you're in a different office now I mean because now bride the bride of Jesus Christ is no stigma with that name wholly away because everything we are we are because of him I mean we no longer have our own identity Holly we have his identity Amen just like when when Ruth Ruth came into Israel she was cheered a stigma she was a mob itis the law said no mob I could into the congregation of Israel there was a stigma she is a widow worth nothing I mean there's a stigma under her mother yeah you're over a mother-in-law don't call me Naomi no more call me Mara my life's become better why there's a stigma associated with it but then when Boaz came when Bowens came to the field and saw and saw Rusia fell in love with her hallelujah amen and and took her his wife I mean now she had no stigma associated to her name because she's no longer Ruth from Moab now she was Ruth of Bethlehem she was the wife of boy's father it's the same thing with us I mean how God is taking care of our paws she say I I wrestle with a lot of things just give it to him he's already taking care of it parlor he's already taking care of your pass you say well a fool of many times just get back up I mean he's already taking care of us hallelujah has he not I mean when he died on Calvary he didn't say well I got you know I need to dog in at the end of the age I mean to to to take care of all the sins in the future no he took care of it all from it from when sin first came in to when sin will end he took care of it all under that blood hallelujah so if he took care of it all I mean we just got to have such confidence Lord you've done it you've taken away yeah the devil tries to put a stigma on us you did this you said this you thought this you acted this way Amen you say no devil that person died I'm an overcomer I've had overcome you by the blood of Jesus Christ member this message is a positioning message it's an adoption message I mean if it's adoption message therefore we will be placed as the Bride of Christ and I believe now we are being places the Bride of Christ we're not looking for a future event now this word I mean it's here to place you in your place hallelujah amen that's something is shout about I mean oz wants us I was once like the sons of korah Oh your daddy did this or you did this under your first breath look at this puts a weight on you imagine them let's not have a family you know family you NuWave you know they were they were stuck with this name they couldn't change this name but one step to the throne hallelu they had the short mercies of David and he and God said no no no no don't let them live under that anymore place them here place them here is the worshipers and I'm gonna speak through you Psalms and they're going to receive that inspiration of that Psalm they're gonna sing it forth themselves and the same inspiration that fell upon you is going to fall upon there and then they're going to sing it and then to create an atmosphere and I'm gonna come down and dwell in their praise how that's the same thing Amen God anointed the Prophet hallelujah and God spoke forth a word amen and then and then God took us placed us in our position we received that word holy the same inspiration falls upon us holy then God comes down among us hallelujah Amen I happen to believe that because the only way that this message can livers of the same inspiration that it was given in it falls upon you I mean the same Holy Ghost that anointed that man's lips brother Browns lips to speak it comes upon you for you to receive it hallelujah and I believe that inspiration is present that's been here quite a while hallelujah it's been waiting for you and here you are hallelujah so they came to their adoption amen under the kingship of David now brother bran would say what to me to me when we when we when you read through the seal series it's not it's not some sermons it's an event he would stand there in the breech and he would go to revelations four and five and he would begin to come down to the scripture where it says and a mighty and a strong angel called he said who's worthy to take the book he says maybe I just feeling this way but who let him come well inspiration was coming and he said every everyday the angel Lord would come into the room and tell them what the seer was the book would come open to the Prophet - to be given to us so so here it was what was happening when John was there up in the eternity he saw no one was worthy to take the book what are the elders said we've not John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah has revealed the Kings prevailed and but when he looked he saw a lamb now to some people he's King he's judge right but to the bride he's lying I mean I mean so he's lamb I mean he's both things at once I mean but the Sami rules out as judgment but but the others he shows mercy hallelujah and it's by our relationship to her me shows us mercy we're always part of them we're ice part of us word Amen so so he's our lamb he's my sacrifice he's my high priest amen he's my he's my propitiation he's my advocate he's my husband he's my he's my lord he's my everything so now what's happening now as the king is coming forth to take over what happened when Jesus came the first time because remember the church when Jesus came or the Old Testament church when Jesus came it was all when he came what they have man-made systems man-made ideas it was all just the church doing this thing but then he cared the King to come to his church and they didn't want him some of them accepted but most didn't why because headship was coming to the body but Israel wouldn't accept it and then so what happens down the end time a chip comes to the body hallelujah but there's a body upon the earth to receive it though the majority may not I mean these are prepared people that will receive the headship of the word and will become one with him and I'm looking at her right now hallelujah so now here comes the king he's got the contents of the kingdom he opens it up and he begins to speak it forth and as he speaks a fourth now people are taking their position remember under the under the administration of Moses and Joshua it wasn't just Israel receiving their inheritance or get or having their place Moses they yeah you know God tells Moses his Moab leave them alone just journey through different ones this is their portion they weren't in the promised land but they were you know they were actually related to Israel through life and his daughters and so on so just leave them where they are just keep journeying through you know if there's trouble well there'll be trouble but you you just leave them where their leave the church nominal where they I don't facet them there's the bride call it they have their place right we have our place a mess just God's grace we have our place and it's not that place so never look down just keep churning through keep walking with the Lord right so one just Israel receiving their inheritance they all had their allotment as well amen so now so when the book came open it wasn't just the bride receiving her lot the devil's going to lake of fire right maybe what was sitting in there the whole time but now it's time for it to be manifested this is who's going for the lake of fire this is going to receive what mercy the white throne judgment the bride won't be judged Christ took her judgment that down Calvary hallelujah she's going to be judging the world amen the Saints will judge the earth right so everyone receives their portion Allu you we just happen to receive the best portion but there's nothing we did it's God's predestination hallelujah that's why we should just be glad Lord I'm so glad you made me me and you I'm so glad you called me under this word hallelujah amen so now the king has come and now we received the full inheritance of the word hallelujah amen now Jesus would say to his disciples I'm kind of jumping in around maybe but he would say to his disciples after they were sent to to cast out devils and and you know heal the sick and so on they came back rejoicing and Jesus would say to them don't rejoice that you have dominion over unclean spirits but rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven amen now we must understand that that had me Judas was with them so these names we know if you you know I'm sure we're all familiar with this but this but there's there's parts of the book of life I mean or in the book of life that that names can be rubbed out and Judas his name was written in heaven but it was erased because isn't that but his name wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life right so now though sure in the Lamb's Book of Life will not worship the beast they actually sees in the book of Revelation that they will have right to go into the city and dwell there now the last book of life we know it's it's a record of names that God thought of before the foundation of the world that they will rule and reign with him and Jesus is saying don't rejoice just because of this but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven so we should rejoice not because people are healed necessarily though that is wonderful but you should rejoice that your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life because remember if it's sudden their brother James sent me a quote you know brother Bram said that no your no rubbing all the rubbing compound in the earth brother Bram said couldn't take your name off that book Talia said nothing can take a remember all those names they mean the devil can't take he can't take those names he can't take those lives I'm in their gods and if our gods Amen that nothing can pluck them from his hand they belong to him kaalia so now if they are in the know if our names are in that book I mean God has to take all claims the devil can put upon us I mean and that's why I'm in the blood of Jesus Christ amen as I said takes care of our past president future Amen so therefore there's nothing that he can hold against us because our Lord took care of it all holy it's like the sons of Korah I mean we can sing praises unto our God I mean we can rejoice Amy will you say thank you Lord we don't have to live under the stigma of our first birth or what our parents did whoever did Amy but we can rejoice I because God your places and the body to sing praises unto you I mean they're more than just singers in the temple Amen but worshipers and spirit and truth I'm in the Bride of Christ yourself hallelujah that's why we should rejoice amen isn't it wonderful God has a record of us in heaven and that's why we've got to understand as young as brother Aaron would say there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life the scripture says who has the son has life eternal life who has not the son doesn't have eternal life and so now but he said amen to in order to have eternal life you did not have a beginning because it's because eternity has no beginning has no end so now when you think about that it shows us that if you have received the Holy Ghost today I mean this word has become a living reality in you I mean that's actually a vindication to you that you have eternal life I'm not talking just about anointing but when the wood comes down into your soul amen and you begin to manifest this message today more than just an anointing people get anointed but they're still got their old nature living but those who have truly strained at all and God lives through them hallelujah amen so it's so it's showing by receiving the Holy Ghost is actually God saying to you I'm putting my seal upon you that you would know you're with me from the foundation of the world hallelujah now Joshua I'm just going to go back to Joshua again well rather than going to read a definition this is what I was going to originally title this was to be impacted by the supernatural now to be impacted it means you come into a forcible contact with another object that's being impacted and some of us have been impacted by bigger things or lesser things but although what it feels like to be impacted by something now Joshua took the people into the land and they were instructed they were instructed to walk around jericho certain number of times christina having fellowship with us yesterday I believe it was or day before and but on the seventh time around member of silence until a certain point and in the trumpets blew and the people shouted now I do with a great shout now just what do you think about this they were under expectation to see the walls come down remember they had just crossed Jordan and I was on dry ground I mentioned I was just thinking about this rejoicing imagine imagine you you know Jordan wasn't flood in that kind of season it was there was the harvest season that they came into came into the Promised Land and so so it's banks were swollen but then imagine you're walking so so you're way in the back somewhere and you're walking over you come over the hill and you see where the Jordan wasn't as dry ground and you see four priests holding an ark in the middle of the river you just see this and you're walking past this you're walking past and you just see these men you walk over and dry ground and then after you've once crossed then you see those same four men with the outcome over and maybe you don't look back and go see where's that river and it's flowing they give it put yourself I put myself in Bible stories imagine seeing that and you've already been in the wilderness you've seen mighty things God has done that put them an expectation for the walls to come down I say everything that God has ever ever done for you put it in an order he did all this for me he's gonna do all this for me I mean because remember the works have been finished from the foundation of the world I mean so every every miracle God over do you say this long this list is this long if he's already done this but he has to do this but I think it's the same God that did the stuff in the beginning will do the rest right amen see here they were there and the expectation I don't believe they're walking around saying what are we doing they didn't walk around saying no no remember we cross that River that was on dry ground Joe the same God that was with Moses as with Joshua that same presences that was with Moses now with this man he said he met the captain our host and Lord he instructed him what to do and we're walking around hallelujah and we heard the spies report and they said the hearts of all the men have failed because of what God did for us in Egypt and he'll do it again you'll do it again Lord you'll do it again Olli will do it again Lord you saved me you'll do it again save my children how do you help me once you'll do it again you heal me again I mean what I've been financial need you help me then you'll do it again probably when I couldn't find my way you'll do it again off I'll find my way so they walked around under expectation that's why I say well we'll go to prayer request we should have no expectation oh we've got a trouble or something we should be under expectation God's gonna fight your battle Amen mimic this is God's bride we are his bride here's our husband we're his life amen if we're his wife then we're under his Dominion we're under his care his protection he'll guide us through he said well what about the martyrs in the and the in the murder age they died in faith because God wants to show the devil doesn't matter what you do to people they will still believe and love me hallelujah brother bran tell a story it was about a woman I you know I don't have the quote here but but there was a woman in Germany and and they just had a newborn baby and the baby was actually died and now calling for brother Branham to come from the United States to come to Germany to pray for the baby that the baby would come back and live and now brother Baron prayed and the Lord said no this is the hand of God tell them this is a and so he related that message to the parents and in a while later the parents came to America and then she was asking brother baron was it because of a lack of faith that my baby wasn't raised to the dead and and he said no no you have great faith but he said no no but you still love the Lord anyhow it's not based on if your baby was raised or not because she she kept walking on loving God anyway irrespective of what happened and the Prophet didn't actually you have great faith because your circumstance of what's happened to your life has not changed your love for God hallelujah because remember having having the revelation the hour does not exempt us from trouble it does not exempt us from trials it does not exempt us from hardship I mean but the revelation of the hour gives us overcoming power that our faith will not waver irrespective of what's going how they just like jobim a job was an extreme case God just said you're Satan's head to God well you just put a he'd drown job that's why he loves you and and God said well I'm gonna prove you wrong and so job was on his ash heap he was they're all in this trouble but yet with his mouth he did not sin against God he had great faith he didn't understand what was going on and remember there has never been once in my life with God sat me down and said okay this is your next six months this is what's going to happen to you never never because of laws that way we wouldn't need faith right but God reveals himself to you and so whatever trouble you can go through you can walk through it irrespective of outcome amen that's not defeatist faith is unwavering remember the devil once just like jhope God nobody so the devil said to job the only reason he loves us because this is hitch and God proved him otherwise and it's the same thing with us you say your brights perfect there's done like on all the earth it's just because you've got the armies of heaven around her there's a wall of fire I mean that's you know and God says that I'll show you I showed you in the dark ages I'll show you today hell yeah and he does he puts us for he puts certain people forth as a example of overcoming power that's but our walks are all tailor-made I mean but Jobe wasn't on the ash heap because he was a secret sinner Jobe was on the ash heap because God was proving to Satan the power of the blood of the Lamb I mean anyone he shot to jove himself hallelujah see everything works for a good now so they were so so here was israel they're walking around jericho under expectation then finally they came the final circle of the wall and the priests blew the trumpet and the people when they heard the sound of the trumpet the people shouted with a great shout now a trumpet has to be fashioned a certain way to give a certain sound it can't be made every trumpet that the reason it gives a different sound it's because of shape different that may be very obvious but you know you take a big French on or a little whatever they have different shapes they they make a different sound now the gospel is your the gospel is the gospel trumpet that's the trumpet of jubilee it's got to be shaped in a certain way I'm in an order for the sound or the note to be made that's just right now it's the same thing with us remember we as believers you know we have to be shaped a certain way and all for the right sound to come out of our lips it means a God has to take us from the world and it's not the dimensions of your vocal cords I'm talking about I mean I'm talking about now when God takes you he justifies you sanctifies as you and fills you with the Holy Ghost now you can make the right sound before that maybe you could sing the same songs everyone else and maybe sing a lot better than those who actually know the Lord but there comes a time when you meet them and it may sound the same but there's an anointing that travels now on your on your song or on your prayer I mean so it actually to God sounds different way because the trumpet has been has been shaped the right way now but in order for a trumpet to blow there's got to be a force got to be a breath that passes through the trumpet I mean so now we know the Holy Ghost is the breath of God he breathed on his disciples he said receive ye the Holy Ghost so now they received a force they were impacted I mean by the life of God he's our breath went into them what is inspiration part of the definition of inspiration is actually like breathing in you receive something Allu you but so so now there has to be a force there's got to be a life go through the trumpet in order to make the sound this is the same thing with you and I the breath of God has to dwell in us that when we begin to praise God or we begin to say no God can do it again God's here he's in charge he'll take care of us he'll be our boss he'll supply our needs he'll fight our battles whatever thing we're facing right now he's in charge of it oh yeah hallelujah he's more than able I mean you began to confess that in God God here's a different kind of sound because he like you know he loves to see us confess this word he likes us to have a positive confession hello I'd like to see his children begin their fellowship and they let me say I've God's alive he's risen hallelujah he's cleanse me from all my sin I mean sure the devil's on my case but God's on my case Gaza I'm on the Lord's side hailer he's here to fight my battle my children are coming in my family's coming in particles are coming home Holly he likes to hear that kind of a confession that's why I always think positive always speak positive yeah you know the old saying if you've got nothing good to say say nothing at all amen we should only speak good hallelujah so now God took a gospel trumpet God fashioned a trumpet in this hour he went through many trials until finally the sword landed in his hand and Sabino Canyon but now the trumpet was ready holier now there's a life came into that trumpet and a blue forth of Jubilee I mean that all who heard that sound of the gospel trumpet can go free so now this way the message came because it's the jubilee trumpet hallelujah a life force was pressing through it hallelujah but then when the people heard the sound of the trumpet the people shouted with a great shout hallelujah why is this shouting why is there noise what happens with noise you you just take the devil knows how this works that's why you see his entertainment people get excited they get relaxed first they begin to enjoy it they get into the spirit of it and then he can inject his doctrine his life into them people go to rock concerts they get caught up in the music whatever concert it is what they begin to enjoy it there's the lights the sound everything then the spirit that travels on that music comes upon the people because he knows how it works but remember he's just a pervert oh right so he takes what God does makes a perverted copy of it to achieve his own ends amen why do we have camps and different things in God yo everyone shouts and rejoices has a wonderful time it's what it shouldn't be just emotion it shouldn't just be excitement because other people are doing it and sure because God's moving on your soul to do it right but what happens in that kind of atmosphere we relax right we relax we begin to enjoy it we get into the spirit of the meeting and God can now work amen brother Brahim said about about iron that's like in order to shape iron you've got to heat it up first if you try and smash it with a with a with a blacksmith hammer you just shatter it but if you get it hot enough then you can shape it to what it needs to be is the same thing when the Spirit of God moves what's happening it's putting heat putting heat into the iron hell yeah so so we can be shaped into the image of his word I mean that's why we shouldn't come to that's why do you think you know from wherever you live so from there for me to hear it's all tense mind battles you know all these things what was that because the devil's trying to get me all tense that I can't enter into the service is it just me and then and then if we sit there with that mind battle we have Co and we sit through the service all that way what's happening and we're all quiet we just all this is going on in these people what's happening you could use a coal bit of iron but God wants you to come out of that thing that's why we have trouble but that's why we shout that's why we you raise our hand say Lord you're so lovely you're so good I'm so thankful in spite of me you called me you save me you redeem me hallelujah that's how we should be he say well you're a book Pentecostal the Pentecostal Church I was in before I came to the message they did not believe in raising their hands I was telling by the Andy who shocked about that that's true they did not believe in raising their hands they believe that wasn't right so you can imagine what kind of church it was Amen so it's not because I had seen it somewhere else I'm happy because I've been redeemed I shot because he's means everything to me I rejoiced because his word is true and I have more confidence in him now than I ever have I'm not looking for a means per minute or people on their feet no I am looking god is alive amen what birth cue was an atmosphere what burst here was an atmosphere bo-ram said you can take a hit chickens ed put under a pup the right temperature it'll hatch a chicken right - the same thing with an eagle you put an eagle egg and in the right atmosphere and Eagle will be birth that means the right atmosphere was needed for us to be born how much our children amen isn't that right that's why I say Lord come not just in church live in my house Civic sense atmosphere around us Lord you're alive Lord you're so wonderful Lord hallelujah that's how it should be shouldn't it an atmosphere at the right atmosphere will bring the right results holy remember we have the mechanics this we have the word but where the dynamics and the Holy Ghost they are coming together in this end time when brother and priests arising of the Sun they said you need both coming together amen amen that's why Europe I find it strange and a voice found this strange when people preach about miracles other people think well they're just not preaching opening of the word and then we're people preach the opening the word other people think well they're just not preaching the supernatural power of God for some reason it's always been that way this is what I found maybe they just might a lot yeah your observation people preach the power of God others look at us how they just don't know the third Paul well they just not preaching the opening of the word but the supernatural is in the opening of the word the supernatural is in the opening of the word I mean when David came to the throne the power of God was there I mean when the sword landed in the prophets hand I mean brother man see there's more things happening in the supernatural now I just don't have time to tell you about it under the opening of the word hallelujah so it's the Satan that's how it should be the angel of the Lord brother Branham says follows the message of the hour wherever the message the hours that Angel Lord is there to fulfill that message Amen - under the third pole is the opening of the word right it opens our eyes give us an understanding who we are amen who we are not who we shall be we already are we just step into that image right so these so the word came open you're the Bride of Christ when he preached invisible union I don't hear all him blasting all the people who are living in denomination I just hear him say you're sinless you're virtuous you never did in the first place you had a wedding band of unmerited premier predestinated grace on your finger parlor you already already had the wedding band hallelujah you already had it on you you's gonna come I just got to come over and say Lord this is what you've made me to be I mean when brother Roberts would would preach spurt slab Nisha and he talked about the soldier that was shell-shocked from the battle and he says part of amnesia actually you get amnesia by being between two opinions as the world's right as the word right is this message right or what you know people get between two opinions and they forget who they are he's saying about thee about the soldiers they were on their way to a mental institution wherever they call it and they were being being being a transported by rail and and the and the soldiers that had to Ebenezer they they got out of the railway carriage and the guards were watching them and one one of them begin to start looking around this is more than a story I was on my way to a mental institution didn't know who I was don't know where I'm going to know where I'm from but ever get to look around but they're not begin to look around and I'm gonna see familiar places something in me identified I am Ruth I am Easter I am right here hallelujah I am David I'm his mighty men I can see myself as Peter James and John I can see myself as John on the Isle of Patmos I can see myself in the New Jerusalem holy and what happened the amnesia begins to break and then now the one who wrote the book comes out just like the father the soldier with the amnesia he begins to walk the guard say just just let him walk just let him walk that's why young people begin walking through the scripture just let them walk walk through the message you'll find who you are hallelujah he begins to walk and they follow me finally he comes to a house and then old man comes out the ports and then gives a big hug his son I knew you'd come home hallelujah and his amnesia broken show this is who I am I mean the shellshock was gone hallelujah it's gonna be the same way with you and I Wow I'm beginning to see myself in the word that he stepped forth I knew you'd come home saying hallelujah now I'm beginning to see who I was hallelujah to God don't let the stigma of your past hold you back hallelujah ain't gonna set this off I was once shell-shocked the father and kid the amnesia brought your home hallelujah and that's why this word should be such something to you it just sounds like home to me hallelujah in spite of my past in spite of whatever stigma it feels like home hallelujah and the reason it feels like home is because it is home and God through it is calling you home never ever forget it well we got trials and troubles in life now I've been called I didn't call myself no one else call me God called me God found me he say but your parents were believers another one day and they weren't at that time but one day God found me hallelujah remember it's your walk it's your walk with God it's not someone else's walk he said well I've just started walking keep stepping I keep falling over just like when the girl started to learn to walk they didn't just get up one day and start running along and skipping they held onto things they'll walk here long and what I do go we're encouraging them daddy's proud of you you can do it you can do it and in their legs begin to muscles begin to grow they really had stronger bouncing than that then they would let go that launched out into space or mostly oh hi Ben they are really going they fell over more when they launched out without holding onto things and sometimes we've got to hold onto the framework of the church right people hold onto a certain thing but then you're gonna let go and you just got to walk with God hold on to that unseen hand but then eventually you go from falling over then you're up when a child learns to walk and they fall over do you ever see a parent in their right mind berating them you're useless you what are you give you know you never ever see that do you think God beats us because we fall down does it deal you know older siblings I'll just kind of put their foot out you know not that the devil's out older sibling video I don't mean you know the deal all triples up sometimes you know the first thing we know childhoods himself what appearance do pick them up in your cake is everything fine calms them down that's okay you know let them go on their way that's what the Lord wants to do with us but I fell daddy don't worry about the stigma of falling it doesn't matter get up you're fine catch you up whatever you need just walk on continued on let's hatch that's what God wants with us he never ever ever holds our past against us never he never purchased our salvation just to hold it and though well if they get naughty enough I'm gonna bring this out that's not how he works he took care of it remember he took all of your sin in your shame he says I'm gonna take care of this I'm gonna carry it up Calvary I'm gonna take it down to hell for you that you don't need to carry it I'll take that stigma give it to me I'll take care of it hallelujah that's how he is and then when we come back to then we're walking with this condemnation man I wish I could Y myself why am I still a son of Korah my father did this boy right yeah I did this and God looks this is I don't remember that why are you carrying that why are you carrying your past I don't remember your past the past the only past I remember of you is when you're shouting and rejoicing before the foundation of the world that's what I remember I remember that's eternal there's no time right so what you were then you'll be there hallelujah says's that's all I remember of you and that's what you're going to be so don't carry we wrestle with our humanity I'm glad people said yep because hey baby it's just me but God made you a certain way God gave you your personality he didn't want us all to be like God is not a cookie cutter right he said well I he said well I don't want to be so emotional God made you emotional you know God made you how you we got to be comfortable in our own skin I remember singing in what Bible four schools are promised y'all thank you Father for making me me and when you let say you're just singing it you don't really assign when you get to a certain age and you see the flaws in your character it's a bit harder to sing but God made you you for a reason and we have to come to peace with that Lord you made me with my personality for a reason amen hello Lou young so they blew the trumpets they shouted hallelujah and the more the walls came down I believe the more they shouted why go so begin to crumble and it fell down Flint hallelujah and it should be the same thing with us amen underneath go from expectation to rejoicing hallelujah amen we're on our way home friends we're on our way home this is this is Nick's toppers home next stop is heaven remember think of everything that the Lord has ever done for you amen if he did all that imagine them going around Jericho they wouldn't let maybe when they went back to camp they'd have testimony meeting anymore it's like when the Death Angel came so Joshua and Caleb were there let's say no you know they put the blood on the door and lentil there's great screams that night but there's no screaming our houses because the blood was applied we were safe we can lead off the pressure and then that there then in the next morning whether it was we walked out of Egypt Caleb you remember what that was like I'm so great hallelujah hallelujah we're walking free and they went to the Red Sea oh my we were there there's great distress among the people but Moses said these Egyptians that you see you won't see them again and they were there the pillar fire was behind us Kipnis as a buffer between us Aryan to me and then he lifted his stuff in the red sea opened I never seen the heaven before my life and then we walked over dry land wholly dry land and we got to the other side I'm just we talk about what God has always done you gotta have a testimony service the same God that meant their misfit you may be different dispensation but the same God there is the same God here and then so they walked across dry land and then now we saw the Egyptians coming after us then Moses lifted his staff and the sea came back over hallelujah and then we realized our enemy was dead I mean an 80 something-year-old woman lifted up a tambourine and she began to rejoice maryam was not a young Chuck young sister she was all that she lived in my worship imagine a million people shouting and praising God holy on the roof yeah you're on the seed bank because their enemy wants the admission there hallelujah and then we came to the waters of Mara it was bitter but Moses found a tree is inspired he cut it down it became sweet so sure there was a bitter part in our walk but but the cross she put it in with the cross that became a sweet experience then we walked on a bit more and God fed us out of the heavens and God came down on Sinai what a precious air was you remember Joshua Oh my pitcher Caleb then we went into the land I might be skipping a few things remember testimony you think what is God done for you there's a reason Caleb why did he do that first we got inheritance remember Caleb going over looking at that mountain and you said I want that one hell yeah have you ever gone to a store you can buy whatever you want I haven't but that'd be cool right that was like that going to the land remember they're looking there's an inspiration coming upon them they're identifying themselves with the part of the land that stairs so there's now a burden on Caleb saying that's mine and then he comes back and they come back with the grapes and all those things and Caleb says I'm seeing where I'm living it's a mountain and he begins to tell his children about it they began have fellowship day after day after day and the promise just gets greater and greater and greater why is it getting greater because God told Moses for one year for every day that the spicer shout the land you'll be in the you'll be in the world and so forty years so after year number one Caleb says children 39 years to go next year 38 I'm not gonna go all the way down to zero but you know what I mean and the expectation would have got greater and greater because the promise was getting more real and more real and more real and it's the same thing with this rapture it's getting more real and it's getting closer and got to getting us ready and we going to leave this world probably the expectation yeah me pills are it's been years hallelujah it's been years we're close I remember on our way and the expectation gets greater why because the Lord's getting us in condition it's not us getting ourselves in condition I mean what haven't win/win/win brother Bram you know he saw he saw the preview of the bride and those ones that were in European garments they were they were walking off the trail cuz they were looking at the wrong thing but he cried out stay in line why because their focus was coming off what they should have been following right and it's got to be the same thing with us we're being led by the pillar of fire I mean this message I mean this is a pillar of fire leading us right but if we keep our take our eyes off and look at other stuff we get out of step and that's even if you look at yourself you get out of step because I've got this problem this is going on do it a little sure all those things may be there but look at him looking unto Jesus the author and finisher not looking unto yourself amen and then now finally here we came Caleb yes Joshua hellooo yeah we're going into the land now and Caleb's 84 years old no doubt he would relate those testimonies over and over and over again and here tell us children God told me I'm gonna take this mountain God told me it wasn't even my desire God came and said you know your desire here for that mountain you have that that burden you have for that mountain that's yours and then he was only four years old then he comes to Joshua Joshua he begins to testify to him I wasn't like the other spies we believe that selves I've been fighting all these years now give me my Mountain and an 84 year old man hallelujah Joshua said that's yours you can take that now oh yeah there he goes anything that's what he got that mountain cause he kept that promise in front of him it's mine and here's under expectation it's mine I mean the stigma of the wilderness was gone how about your stigma I'm gonna leave it there Jesus is taking care of it you see I came from a terrible background that don't matter that's irrelevant don't ever let it hold you back I'm going through big things don't worry about it I meant keep racing the battle hallelujah and everything will be fine [Music] let's read that again
