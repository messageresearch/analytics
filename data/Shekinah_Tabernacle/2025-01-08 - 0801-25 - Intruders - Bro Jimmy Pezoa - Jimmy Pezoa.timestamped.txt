[24:15] hu Hallelujah
[24:18] [Music]
[24:35] want to give you thanks for everything
[24:36] Lord and I want to ask you to please
[24:39] talk to me Lord let me edify your body
[24:42] Lord I ask you this in Jesus Christ name
[24:45] amen amen thank
[24:50] you
[24:52] amen
[24:53] well I think Sundays are for Christians
[24:57] Wednesdays are for Fanatics and probably
[25:00] youth meetings are for crazy people if
[25:03] you come to church you you really love
[25:06] the love the Lord
[25:08] amen so let's open our Bibles in the
[25:10] book of um
[25:12] Luke chapter
[25:14] 12 where
[25:17] um 35 down to 40
[25:29] amen so the Bible says let your Lo be
[25:33] GED about and your lights burning and ye
[25:37] yourself like unto men that wait for
[25:39] their lord when he will return from the
[25:42] wedding that when he cometh and knocketh
[25:45] they made open unto him immediately
[25:48] blessed are those servants who the Lord
[25:50] when he cometh shall find waiting verely
[25:53] I said unto you that he shall get
[25:55] himself and make them to sit down to
[25:57] meet and will come forth and serve them
[26:00] and if he shall come in the second watch
[26:03] or come in the Third Watch to find them
[26:06] so blessed are those servants and this
[26:10] now if the good man of the house had
[26:13] know what hour the thief will come he
[26:17] would have watched it and not have
[26:19] suffered his house to be broken through
[26:22] be ye therefore ready also for the son
[26:25] of man cometh at an hour when you when
[26:29] you think not amen you can have your SE
[26:32] let the Lord bless his
[26:35] word amen so
[26:39] um it's an honor for me to be here on a
[26:42] Wednesday praise the lord it's had never
[26:45] been easy for me to stand here for some
[26:48] people it look like can be easy for for
[26:50] me it's
[26:52] not
[26:53] but it's always a blessing
[26:57] amen so the
[26:59] thought that I want to speak today it's
[27:03] just like a scrumble egg but from a
[27:07] heart amen so we know as a Christians we
[27:11] are in a war right and against Satan and
[27:17] his demons but it's not a war against
[27:20] flesh in one to
[27:22] another remember cuz we are in the same
[27:25] team amen and our equipment is given by
[27:30] God and is is spiritual to fight Satan
[27:34] and not to fight brother against sister
[27:36] right brother to brother or sister
[27:38] against sister or those kind of
[27:42] conflicts this is not something that I
[27:44] really want to to talk cuz I I'm not the
[27:48] pastor but the Lord put this thought in
[27:50] my mind and I could have preached about
[27:53] another thing but this is the thought
[27:55] that the Lord put in my heart amen
[27:59] and we know as that as we stand
[28:03] together we can win but if we are
[28:06] divided we're just going to
[28:08] fall so as
[28:11] humans this is the way that um the Lord
[28:14] matters right so we have a body and we
[28:19] connect to this world through our senses
[28:22] see smell hear taste and feel right then
[28:25] we have a spirit where a memory
[28:29] reasoning affection imagination and
[28:31] conscious and then we have our soul
[28:34] where can be Faith or doubt amen but
[28:37] there's some things that there are like
[28:39] outside like contentions malice Pride
[28:42] lust Envy Strife hatred fear sickness
[28:46] Temptations ambition Fame honor want
[28:51] trial stress threats necessity and
[28:55] problems so the way that how the devil
[28:59] can attack us it's like if he send one
[29:01] of those
[29:02] missiles and if you don't have your
[29:04] Shield of Faith up it's going to attack
[29:07] you and you're going to get the damage
[29:09] right let's say if the devil put this
[29:12] thought that you're dead is a lame
[29:15] person if the devil put this thought
[29:17] that you're dead he's not a nice guy how
[29:20] are you going to stop it are you do you
[29:23] want to stop it or do you want to get
[29:26] damaged amen you have the word God that
[29:28] said that you should honor your dead
[29:30] right but if if you don't put that
[29:32] Shield that filter you're going to get
[29:34] the damage right for no reason CU you
[29:37] have the shield let's say again what
[29:41] about if you have a brother and one
[29:43] brother doesn't shake your hand one
[29:46] day how are you the bible say that we
[29:48] should forgive one one to another right
[29:52] but what about if we don't have our
[29:53] filter
[29:55] on Boom attack again
[29:59] but this message is not you're going to
[30:02] be short cuz I can't preach for long and
[30:03] you know that it's a prayer meeting
[30:07] anyway what I really wanted to talk
[30:09] today is about an
[30:12] intruder because an intruder is someone
[30:14] that just breaks in he's not invited but
[30:19] somehow just get into you you don't want
[30:22] it probably you don't even know that
[30:24] there but it's
[30:25] there amen
[30:29] um so the definition of an intruder is a
[30:33] a person who intrudes or just break into
[30:35] especially into a building with Criminal
[30:38] Intent he's not there because want to
[30:42] give you a surprise he's a Criminal
[30:44] Intent he he wants something from you
[30:47] amen but there's a difference between a
[30:50] a intruder and a
[30:54] visitor let's say if Leon come to my
[30:57] place he's a visitor I'm not going to
[30:59] take him as Intruder right
[31:02] Liam I'm not going to take my crossbow
[31:04] and try to shoot you Liam cuz you're a
[31:06] visitor and I want you to be at my place
[31:09] right but if you have an intruder you
[31:12] don't want it
[31:13] right
[31:17] amen so here just um kiwis have reported
[31:21] a
[31:23] 18237 KN residential burglaries to the
[31:27] police and the last four years that's an
[31:29] average of one every 12
[31:32] minutes that's crazy if and I mean like
[31:36] if that's in the natural how much in the
[31:38] spiritual how many thoughts can the
[31:40] devil try can try to put in your mind in
[31:44] one day amen and if we don't have our
[31:47] Shield
[31:49] up we can get the damage right and for
[31:53] no reason we have the word of God but
[31:57] sometimes
[31:58] I mean we can be tired and it's just so
[32:02] easy sometimes to get affected because
[32:05] that's the way that the Lord created us
[32:07] we have emotions we're humans right we
[32:10] can get
[32:11] hit but the last thing that we want is
[32:14] an
[32:15] intruder and I put that picture there CU
[32:18] that snake looks scary right it's big
[32:22] and probably someone has been feeding
[32:25] that snake for a long time
[32:28] amen I he this from a preacher I thought
[32:31] it was from brother Brandon but I talked
[32:33] to Benny and he say it's
[32:34] not if sorry B if you get to a house to
[32:40] your house and you see a snake like that
[32:42] will you go to sleep that
[32:44] night will you put your kids in bed and
[32:47] just turn off the light and go to sleep
[32:50] no way you would go there grab a shotgun
[32:53] or whatever stick and kill the thing and
[32:56] put it outside your house cuz you don't
[32:58] want that creature to live in your house
[33:00] amen but that can happen we are humans
[33:05] and this has been like one of the first
[33:07] sermons of the year I can say like let's
[33:11] beware of these things
[33:15] amen
[33:17] um
[33:19] okay so we know that we can turn on the
[33:23] light amen we have the word of God which
[33:27] is just light it can shine and it can
[33:30] show these things cuz these creatures
[33:32] they like the darkness right but when
[33:35] you turn on the light you can see them
[33:37] but there's some creatures that they
[33:39] hide even more but let's turn on the
[33:42] light right
[33:45] so this sermon could have also be like a
[33:48] called squarters but I don't like that
[33:50] word because it doesn't sound that
[33:52] danger Dangerous as Intruder you know
[33:55] but we talking about just the same thing
[33:59] so the only way to know if that you have
[34:01] one of this quarters of intruders in
[34:04] your life is if you feel that you are
[34:08] losing your joy or your peace
[34:11] something's taken away from you cuz that
[34:14] creature has to be fed
[34:17] amen it can be you are feeling more like
[34:21] anxity or depression or even unbelief
[34:25] and I don't know why I wrote this thing
[34:27] but there was actually a guy called
[34:29] Anthony
[34:31] flu I I have a picture of him he was
[34:33] born in 1923 and he died in
[34:37] 2010 and he became an atheist when he
[34:39] was 15 years old he spent 6 66 years
[34:44] arguing against the existence of God but
[34:47] he changed his mind and he spent his
[34:50] last six years of life saying that there
[34:52] was a God because the universe and life
[34:56] was too complex just
[34:58] just to being like a random thing if cuz
[35:02] there's young people here and I went
[35:04] through this I I tried to call myself a
[35:06] atheist but this guy spent 63 years like
[35:11] writing books talking to people saying
[35:15] that God didn't exist but then he
[35:17] changed his mind so if you're feeling
[35:20] any doubt about the existence of
[35:23] God read his last book I think his last
[35:27] book is called God exist because it's
[35:30] too comp the universe is just way too
[35:32] complex just to don't have a god a
[35:35] Creator
[35:37] amen so how can we identify an intruder
[35:43] right we we spoke already about not
[35:46] having Joy or
[35:48] peace and I wrote here more like to us
[35:52] to bring it to like a practical thing
[35:54] like when you see a redeemed Son of God
[35:58] or when you see a redeemed daughter of
[36:01] of God when I see brother Arman or ID or
[36:05] brother Kuban there just a fish Graham I
[36:09] didn't call you Simon this time uh
[36:11] brother
[36:12] B Mt or whatever
[36:15] Jor first thing that I do is smile cuz
[36:19] you're so precious to
[36:21] me you know we are in the same
[36:25] team but when there is a when there is
[36:27] one of these creatures living in your
[36:30] life then you have start feeling
[36:32] something against a brother or against a
[36:36] sister and you didn't even want to be
[36:38] close to them you feel this thing and it
[36:43] shouldn't be that way cuz we are in the
[36:44] same team
[36:46] right we have the word of God we know
[36:49] how to fight this thing right amen um
[37:00] we know how to get rid of this things
[37:01] being like in the presence of God right
[37:04] and these things they have like a
[37:07] environment that they like this creature
[37:09] doesn't like to come to church you know
[37:11] that right because in this place or on
[37:15] any church that you really worship the
[37:18] name of the Lord he doesn't feel welcome
[37:20] so that creature needs like a
[37:22] environment to feel and and to feel like
[37:26] Pleasant and to grow right right
[37:29] so let's make it uncomfortable for this
[37:33] Creator amen and the word of God can
[37:35] shine and search in our lives and let
[37:38] get rid of everything what not from the
[37:40] Lord
[37:42] amen so I went to the website of the New
[37:45] Zealand Police and I wrote how to
[37:47] prevent braries amen and says that you
[37:52] we have like a alarm system which we
[37:56] have coll at with neighbors we have a
[38:00] fellowship lock the doors that's
[38:02] something that you have to do you have
[38:04] to lock the doors right don't watch
[38:08] things that you shouldn't watch
[38:10] amen have exterior light cuz if a beg
[38:14] sees exterior light probably not not
[38:17] with this guy and I wrote down here a
[38:20] dog dog used to be protected not this
[38:24] tiny little dog that people have now I
[38:27] me talking about a dog amen
[38:29] [Laughter]
[38:33] sorry
[38:35] so um but if you have a
[38:39] dog and if is
[38:42] barking you should trust that dog CU
[38:46] that dog has a better sense of hearing
[38:48] than you right and brother brandham he
[38:53] speak about this um story about a
[38:55] prospector right I really love the story
[38:58] say years ago when they used to have
[39:01] gold out out there in the mountains I
[39:04] read a story many years ago ago it
[39:07] always stuck with me it said there was a
[39:10] prospector went out here somewhere
[39:12] beyond the mountain here and was Pro
[39:15] prospecting for gold and he struck a
[39:17] rich clim and he came back thinking when
[39:20] he got to the city that he will be his
[39:23] travels was all over and he tried to say
[39:27] to tomorrow I'll get in I I'll get in
[39:30] and I will just one day Journey he will
[39:34] be into City and he will have the go and
[39:37] he had big sacks full of it and he had a
[39:40] dog with him not comparing now the dog
[39:43] to the Hol to the Holy Spirit but as I'm
[39:46] making an illustration but this dog
[39:49] through the night the prospector laid
[39:51] upon his bed and he began to think now
[39:53] tomorrow I'll take my go in and I will
[39:56] become
[39:57] just what I always wanted to be always
[40:01] wanted to be a rich man
[40:03] wanted wanted to own fine things and so
[40:08] for and then this dog began to bark and
[40:13] because there was an enemy approaching
[40:15] and he went out there and said shut up
[40:18] and he and the
[40:20] dog and so the dog quieted down and no
[40:24] more that got back in bed bed he started
[40:28] like he was going to sleep and the dog
[40:30] started again just jumping at the chain
[40:34] and he went to the door again and said
[40:37] shut up I want you to know that tomorrow
[40:40] I'm a rich man see that was his U great
[40:43] dream but the dog started barking again
[40:46] and finally he got discouraged and went
[40:48] and got his shotgun and shot the
[40:51] dog and kill kill it he said I won't be
[40:55] no more use for you tomorrow tomorrow
[40:58] I'm a rich man and I will become a rich
[41:00] man tomorrow and he sit the gun down the
[41:03] corner turn his back over the door went
[41:06] to sleep and the man had been following
[41:08] him for days slipped into and killed him
[41:11] and he wasn't a rich man see he stopped
[41:14] that warning buzer that was trying to
[41:17] tell him his life was at how do you
[41:20] pronounce that word it's like a
[41:23] steak steak
[41:28] and brothers and sisters you will never
[41:30] be able don't ever try to Hash the holy
[41:34] calling in your heart see by joining a
[41:37] church by reiding a Creed by belonging
[41:39] to a certain organization there is only
[41:42] one thing that can satisfy the person
[41:45] Jesus Christ as a had panth for the
[41:48] water broke so my soul THS after thee Oh
[41:51] God my soul fears for the Living God see
[41:54] there is something in you that wants to
[41:56] see the moving of God your soul thirs
[41:59] for it it don't stop anything short of
[42:04] that so this perspective thought that he
[42:07] was going to be
[42:08] rich and that's a way that you can think
[42:11] as a young person if you could have just
[42:16] shut up that
[42:18] dog you could have be rich right but let
[42:21] me tell you something like our man
[42:24] said you are not going to be rich and
[42:27] you should never shut that door cuz that
[42:30] door is there I'm not I'm not calling
[42:34] the Holy Spirit a dog but you have that
[42:36] b here then you know when you're doing
[42:39] something wrong you know cuz you have
[42:41] that
[42:43] you how's that a scripture that say that
[42:45] the Lord he was going to write his word
[42:47] in our hearts right that's the way that

[42:55] heart amen and I I hope that in yours
[42:58] too
[43:01] amen and as everyone here is a young
[43:05] person says Where withth all shall a
[43:08] young a young man cleanse his way by
