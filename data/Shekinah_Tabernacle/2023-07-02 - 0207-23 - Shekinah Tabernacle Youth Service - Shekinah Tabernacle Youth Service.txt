truly blessed thankful this um being an amate dear Lord and the only father we can all just receive receive a blessing praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen musicians amen we just turned into our Bibles to um Acts 2 38 and this afternoon I will be speaking about baptism amen so it says here an ax chapter 2 verse 38 says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I mean so it's so we know that to be saved you must be baptized amen and and the Lord Jesus says here in Mark 16 16. he says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned amen so he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen so to be saved you need to be to be baptized the brother Branham says here now remember you're just accepted Christ see now God will give you the Holy Ghost and confirmation of your faith see now you get to some good Full Gospel Church and be baptized right away and God's on under obligation to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the moment that you're baptized amen if you come with a True Heart leaving Peter said just repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is that right God promised that now he'd make everything right amen you may all be seated amen and all those who receive the Holy Ghost before they were baptized would have to be baptized later on to fulfill the the scriptures amen I mean and now we're going to move on to where it says in Acts 258 Peter um talks about remission of sins and we know that remission means forgiveness amen and in Acts 22 16 this is um ananias he's speaking to Paul and he says and why terrius thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins amen so his sins are being being forgiven calling on the name of the Lord I mean so when you're being baptized you know you're um your your before your submission that what do you know you're you're asking the Lord to to forgive you amen and so that your your he can wash away your sins and then when you get get underneath that water it's like you you're dying to yourself you want to die to your old life and when you come back you are living and you to Christ amen and this types of the burial and resurrection of Christ and then this is found in Romans six and three it says know ye not that so many of us were baptized unto Jesus Christ we're baptized unto his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection amen so and and also you know we need we so like I just said you know we need to repent and ask the Lord and then you know the Lord will come and wash out our sins he will give us us remission for our sins I mean I'll move on and so you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ very important amen can't be like the denominations who believe is in three Gods God is one God with titles I mean there won't be three people in heaven and we go to we can look at Matthew 28 19 and the Lord Jesus is here go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost amen and brother Branham says here the only way that they were commissioned to be baptized was go and teach All Nations he said back there and baptized them into the name not in the name into the name father son Holy Spirit and the disciples turned right around and baptized everybody in the name of Jesus Christ amen and commissioned that if anybody had been baptized any other way you had to come and be re-baptized again before they could get the Holy Ghost I mean and there were some people who John had baptized and they had to go get baptized again and brother and also speaks about it he says and some of the people will read in the moment that were baptized by immersing by John the Baptist just unto repentance not for remission of sins they had to come and be re-baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ in order to receive the Holy Ghost amen so that is very important to always be baptized name of Jesus Christ amen and now we'll move on to you need to be fully immersed in water when you are baptized amen and um we know that word immerse means to put something or someone completely under the surface of a liquid amen um brother Branham says it here and I said since early days that you all have changed it you have substituted sprinkling or pouring for immersion amen and just just an example of immerse um who he knows Michael Maloney just just all of you know I mean he was um wait I used to play with him when I was quite young we just um when I was about five or six they had a big pedicle it was full of sheep and anyways they were all and we were trying to write them and anyways sheep will kind of move together they all move in a like a line it's like a train and there may be three aside you know they're and in a row and there'll be like 10 lines of three and they'll just all follow each other anyways poor little Michael would manage to get in front of this moving train of sheep and he got shot on and they ran completely over the top of them but in that it was probably about six seconds that he was underneath all those sheep he was fully submerged under them couldn't stick his hand up you know he was just fully trapped I mean that should be like us in the water you know we can't even snug a hand up we're just fully immersed amen I mean and we also know that we need it needs to be water amen or amen and um John 1 31 says and I knew him not that he shall be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water amen and in Acts 8 36 and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized amen so all we need is some water amen and um we'll move on to you need to be old enough to be baptized amen a baby although they are born in sin they aren't conscious of it until they reach the age of accountability so the baby doesn't know that he needs forgiving and brother Bradham ties it up quite nicely he says so the child is too young to be baptized the baptism is the outward expression that an inward work of Grace has been done and the child cannot express it because there hasn't been any inward work of Grace you see because it's just a baby I mean so I trust you're truly blessed and then if we could just have up the musicians and I mean um quicker will just stand stand to our feet if anyone would like to be um I'll grow stand to our feet if anyone would like to be remembered in prayer if you have a need on your heart that you would like the Lord to come to come touch would you just just raise the hand to the Lord I mean the heavenly father dear Lord I just thank you for this this blessed time dear Lord Jesus and dear Lord if there's any needs on any on the on the hearts of the hands that were raised the only father I pray you just just meet that need and just deal or just touch that life dearly father dear Lord of finial would like to be baptized Heavenly Father dear Lord may you just really just put the desire upon the heart to dear Lord Jesus dear Lord they can just start to themselves and and just their lord and just be be saved every father dear Lord come into your great Kingdom dearly father I thank you for this place of time dear Lord Jesus Christ now bro amen amen God bless you everyone got to hand it back over to kill amen the Lord for the worst thing just let me say just let me say how much [Music] here live okay

foreign [Music] everything is [Music] about our heads are actually we'll just pray the heavenly father will be just come to you this afternoon Lord complete the rest of the service with your hands Lord Lord we just want to say how much we love you Lord Lord we thank you for what you've done for us Lord and and Lord Jesus Lord we we are your hands and faith in this earth Lord Jesus and Lord we just let the song say as long we're just surrendered we're finding ourselves surrender to you Lord and Lord you are well able Lord Jesus let us grow into everything that you have for us Lord we thank you Lord in Jesus name amen I mean it just turned our Bibles to um so let's get my slides up uh just to uh John 10 verse 1. uh it's probably going to be a little bit of a different youth service but I believe it'll be a blessing anyway so uh um just John 10 verse 1. the Bible says verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climath up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he's interested in by the door as The Shepherd of the Sheep to whom the portal openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth him out and when he put his Force forth his own sheep he goeth before him and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and the stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers amen you can have your seats laughs just have to stop my tablet out I put it on power saving mode just before I came up here and let's just change everything just there we go I mean I just want to speak this afternoon about God's wisdom versus Satan's wisdom and and we can see in this in this verse in what we just read it says and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and the strangers they will not follow and just a little bit further down on that same uh scripture reading it says the thief cometh not but forth is still steel and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly and uh so you know there's a provided Way by God through his life for each one of us as we know and that's his word he sent his word the Bible said Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and man to not live by bread alone but by every word but that proceedeth from the mouth of God and and I believe that's his voice like that scripture said uh we hear his voice and not a strangers but you know and Satan is the thief and easy out to kill and to destroy and you know if God has a voice Satan is right there he also has a voice and it's just this nature that's what he does he breaks down any any work of God anywhere where God is moving he'll try and break it down and uh brother Ben tells the story I'm sure you all know it we're um where he saw a vision of the man going around the earth well um I believe it was an angel or or or or the Lord sowing seeds walking around the earth sowing seeds and and just after the man came another man dressed in black sort of dodging around the earth real sneaky also sowing seeds and he was sowing weeds and tears trying to break down what what God was doing and the sermon wisdom versus Faith Barbarian talks about how the devil tries to undermine God's word by offering his wisdom against God's wisdom God will say God will speak the word and Satan will offer his wisdom against it I'll just read this quote on the downstairs now of course anything that the devil has is a perversion of the original sin is a perversional perversion of righteousness adultery is a perversion of a legal act a lie is a version of Truth and so the wisdom that I want you to get straightened out on before we start there is a wisdom of God a wisdom of God is stay with his word but Satan and his wisdom try to twist the word so that's the wisdom I'm speaking of there's a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan in order to accept Satan you've got to believe Satan so there's a perverted Faith to a perverted thing and anything that would try and twist the word of God to make it say something that it doesn't is the wrong Spirit see offering wisdom against God's wisdom and uh and that's just the way it was in the beginning with Adam and Eve Satan presented his wisdom with the truth with God's word and but with a slight twist and that twist that twist was a lie and he was trying to pervert it to make it say something that it that it wasn't saying and in the beginning we um where the Bible speaks about where the dragon drew the third part of the stars from heaven and brother Graham says uh the Bible talks about the tale of the dragon and brother Brandon explains it it's not like a physical tale that he drew the stars from the heavens it's the tale that he told and and the Bible speaks about how the devil is a liar and the father of Lies so anything that he offers against God's wisdom is a lie and some and just the way he does it he tries to hide it and make it sometimes make it seem to you that God's speaking to you but it's not wow and Isaiah it says how thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how thou cut down to the ground which did weakened the Nations for they always said in thine heart I will descend and Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the size of the north so we can see his intention and the spirit in in behind him coming to you and offering his wisdom against God's wisdom in the greatest battle ever fought by the Realms is this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and that's when Satan told his tail and Drew the angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan comes to destroy God's creation what to create what God had created to be for himself he said Satan he had Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it in the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since yeah so um yeah so we can see um how Satan at the beginning tried to undermine faith in God's word by approaching Eve and offering his wisdom against God's wisdom and as we said before he he quoted the truth to her but he twisted it yeah to to his ends to give you a message that's not the intent of what God spoke but it's still sort of in line with what God was saying but it's a lie and uh you know we can see this all through the the Bible how this this battle between wisdom and Faith rage down Through the Ages uh down to Moses time Moses preached the word of God and Satan offered his wisdom against it and um when when the Lord created all the plagues through Moses in Egypt uh the Bible talks about how The Magicians could do the same so Moses created frogs and The Magicians did the same Moses turned the water into blood and The Magicians did the same but there came a point where where they couldn't keep up with the Miracles of God and um and yeah Satan's lie broke down like the truth will always Prevail and yeah right right down Through the Ages there's been this battle through wisdom and faith and and in our lives it comes a lot closer to home because it's right here where it happens that battle between wisdom and faith is right here it comes that's that's that's where it's like we read before where brother Brown said um the battle starts in the human mind that's where that all between wisdom and Faith happens is right there amen and the bearings win this great battle had started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin we might have read that I'll just skip down to the yellow there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin and that is because the decisions are made from the mind the head and a bit further down because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you you don't even you don't even go looking for it but it will meet you the battle will meet you there and uh you know I guess that battle offers well it starts out for any believer or non-believer as am I gonna believe this am I gonna give my life to Christ and once you have the devil doesn't stop he will he can be a born-again safe believer but he will keep attacking you in your mind to make you live and defeat love you below your privileges as a Christian and you know I'm sure any Christian that's been a Christian for a while has experienced these mind battles and it's probably for someone in the world I don't think they maybe experienced it the same way we do because anything goes in the world but as a Christian anything doesn't just go for you yeah and you know the devil studies our natures and he attacks our weak spots brother Brown talks about those weak spots that we've got to keep covered and he studies he studies your nature and he'll he'll find that weak spot and try and exploit it but my man he's defeated and uh and yeah he's nothing was he's nothing but a bluff I just want to read you something here um what about the brand of interviews um sister Bruce she had some questions on her heart I'm sure a lot of you probably have read this already um I believe with all my heart that you were a real Born Again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person and you just get things on your mind see little bitty things and it just keeps building up both ways you'll get somebody in your heart and you want to pray for them get up and pray for it you can't rest until you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side Satan Maybe Might present something to you out this way he'll take it overboard I think God you're a nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not you see you keep building this and maybe this and this don't look at yourself Mr Bruce but yeah that's what I the point I want to make is you urinate so you're both a certain way and God works with that nature and Satan works with that nature against God's word sure and uh you know I'm not just going to keep talking about Satan because he's defeated but we just want to expose him um and you know he is the master of Mind Games how could he deceive even the beginning so convincingly that it caused this fall everything we see on this Earth today everything wrong but he did it and he he will present things his way to grind you as a Believer into the ground and he will he will he'll present his narrative with his twist just um as an example one why he attacks me and I'm sure a lot of other believers as well all of us is he'll come to you and you'll point out your weaknesses and your failures it'll say see see what you did yeah um you you can't approach God you can't take a promise you can't you maybe you're struggling with something you can't you can't approach God look what look at look at your life and and the thing is that's a lie yeah because you know you're a born-again Believer your desire is to serve God with all your heart and you know he died for our iniquities too he didn't just die for other sins he died for iniquity and iniquity is you know what's right and you don't do it or you know something is wrong and you still do it he died for that too um I don't have the quote up there but I was reading where brother Brown says um you know the blood covers Us God hears our voice he doesn't see us he sees the blood of Christ and he hears our voice amen so all those things are under the blood all right and and we have access to him and another thing is it it might sound I don't know how this sounds but it's true we think that way like um you know God is not there with a stick ready to beat you every time you're wrong every time we do something wrong and it sounds it sounds funny but that's the way we often think um he's our father and and and you know we don't have to be condemned by every little thing yeah that we stumble a Believer has access to God well the random season assuming here the price the price that was paid and the bondage of Satan was broke God put back into the hands of man away back to what he was looking for he had to weep no more hit when he was broke when he when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary the backbone of sin of sickness and it brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sins forgiven hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan black us off from God Amen there's a highway made there's a telephone sitting there there's a line to Glory because every person in reach of that line if a man is full of sin and connected him on Central he can't be he can be forgiven of it so not only that but sin is paid for oh you don't have to say I'm not worthy sure you're not you never could be but a worthy one took your place you are free you don't have to wonder anymore amen you don't have to be a patient seeking a pleasure seeking man out here on the Earth I just wanna I just want to read you a quote um I just want to go back again uh there's something I found quite amazing so here's the sister that went to um what went up in one of the prayer meetings of brother branham's and I think it's in the servant deep nodes might be a different sermon but um but she came up to the prayer line and I'll just read it no we'll be strangers I see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble in your heart and you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of Blackness I see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie someone told a lie on you and that was a man that was professing Divine Healing you said you were a witch is that true and you've got a holster in your church or something another about it isn't that right your pastor's sick right now he's got bolio is that right sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're lying and the only thing that's wrong with you your heart is that nervous condition got your heart all worked up go on home in peace and God bless you you're right God bless you you're not a witch yeah and isn't it amazing how this sister had a heart trouble she had a whole nervous breakdown because of a lie yeah yeah Satan was offering something against what the word said she was yeah yeah and she didn't know how to find it but she believed it and and and brother bam says I see a whole lot of Blackness it's like a black sheep following you in in heart trouble but it was all a lie yeah and and I mean and and in our lives and our minds Satan can attack us on certain on certain things but it's a lie and he'll he'll pose as God because he know he can't just uh straight out deny the Lord and say um say something against us would you recognize him but he will admit the word and he says but like for example that condemnation he had missed the word but no you can't take it because you because look at what you did yesterday um oh and the thing is one thing it's amazing also is you know he'll plant a little seed in your mind somewhere in your life maybe maybe just recently but you don't because you don't know how to fight it and you don't recognize it it grows and and it grows it because it wasn't rooted out straight away you start thinking on it and you start thinking on it you become negative your brain starts releasing negative chemicals and you're before you know it you're right and that downward spiral that he's trying to catch you with instead of at the start recognizing for what he is but let me ask you what delivered that sister it was when that lie was exposed yeah and when that lie was exposed he had nowhere to hide and and she was free that's all it was like that heart trouble everything was a lie she just had to recognize and see that it was a lie and uh you know because it's such a real battle in our minds it can be hard but but the law can expose any lie and um yeah I believe that brother Branham says that overcoming is recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks yeah every one of us tricks how he gets you on your little weak spots that you've got to keep covered and when you recognize that attack you can fight against it and say no I choose faith faith in what the word says above the situation that I'm finding myself in and uh I won't keep talking about the devil but um but he's he's defeated um and and one way I've realized to recognize the devil's condemnation as opposed to the Lord's conviction is has condemnation drives you into the ground it leaves you no way of escape and you you don't know you don't know up from down left from right that's anything where those vibes is not of God and brother Adam says both of these sources God's was God's faith and Satan's wisdom will create an atmosphere so if you give in to Satan's wisdom that is offering against God's faith it will create an atmosphere and uh may the Lord help us to remain in the right atmosphere it can be so hard but brother bears in the right atmosphere Eagles will be born and obviously the negative is also true the opposite is also true and uh you know I just pray that the Lord reveals his heart to us because um you know maybe it's the way you've been brought up or maybe there's something in your life that skewed your perception of who God is and what he is maybe it was a father that um that was very hard on you or something um and and or even just something along the way that was planted when you were a kid and now and later on in life it grows and you've got a skewed perception of what God's heart toward you really is foreign because like we said before he's he's he doesn't condemn you and drive you into the ground without a way of moving forward in Victory he he builds you up and he's your father and he wants you he wants you to overcome and to succeed and and you know the Bible says God doesn't ever present help in time of trouble and uh you know when I found it myself you know there's times where you you don't know up from down left from right but isn't it wonderful how we can go on our knees and ask the Lord help us Lord help me Lord and He will like Ben preached this morning um uh probably wasn't the same words but he won't leave you there he will not leave you there anyone that calls out to him he will he will he will lift you up and and I know it's not his desire it is his desire to um and his will to undo the complexes and things that hinderella walk with him is absolutely his desire that's why he he lays his finger on it sometimes it shows us and that's them starting to undo that stuff I believe will not leave us there um for the in the Bible it says full Iration racial not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places yeah so it's a it's a spiritual battle it's not a it's not a physical battle and uh to contact that the Bible says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds spiritual strongholds strongholds in our minds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ I don't know how many of you have listened to brother Donnie Reagan's sermon uh facts versus faith but essentially the devil can show you the facts but the truth is God's word amen um and any imagination anything that's true that he points out but with a Twist to bring his message across instead is is wrong and we cast those things down and bring into captivity those thoughts to The Obedience of Christ and uh Madam says but you act in the moment that when nothing else can act we are given to know Lord that if we have any rivers that we cannot cross if we have any mountains we cannot go through God Specializes in doing things that others cannot do so no matter what the trouble whether it is whether it's uh what the trouble whether it's a family strain maybe stubbornness or temper or something that that just just enters your walk with God the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds for the Brown says what did it do God zeroed in on Calvary he wounded that animal called Satan forever now he's been more vicious since then because it's brought to light the human race and anyone knows that a wounded animal is most vicious crawling around with his back broken now Satan was knocked out at Calvary the Earth proved that it was amen he was knocked down he broke the backbone of sin of sickness of any spiritual trouble anything he broke the ability of Satan to keep us from seeing the truth his ability to hold us back through complexes and mind battles but button talks about this uh tells a story about the um Express agent bringing bringing a box of rattlesnakes to your door and that can be anything there can be anything it can be a sickness it can be something that you're struggling with a mind battle and uh he says what if someone came up in the morning to your door an Express agent and throw the whole basket full of rattlesnakes and had your name on them said here they are they're yours you know they're there just like you know your symptoms is there if you receive them they're yours but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them say your names on them say I don't want them I don't have them he can stand there and argue as much as he wants to but until you take them and sign for them they belong to the express company until you sign for them don't sign for nothing the devil brings there is though I refuse to have it take it back you have nothing to do with it if you won't testify that you've got it when you justify you still have it your sickness the devil keeps it with you but refuse to testify of it say I won't have it no sir oh my that's when you're getting Faith give your faith a chance don't it loose on loose unbridled it let it work you've got it all bound down with Traditions turn it loose cut it Loose let God have his way with you somebody's word is right either what you're looking at or what God says God's word is true believe it all right but the first time you testify of your sickness it brings you right down to that realm again you sign for it refuse to sign for it testify what you believe oh I saw this thing on the uh the news the other day how Israel's got some sort of torpedo defense system that where if they send a torpedo to a sub when it reaches that sub it makes a torpedo turn around and go back to the southern centered and and and and blows up that sub that centered instead and and I believe it's the same way with with the Christian you know the devil will send us Torpedoes but we reverse the back and say no it's not mine and uh and you know he's gonna ask her for everything that he tried to do against the children of God out uh I'm not sure if I have the quote here but brother Brown spoke about um if a way to commit something to God if there's a trouble or something that you're facing um I don't have the quote but what he says um is if there's something whether it's stubbornness or a temper or whatever trouble it may be it might be fear whatever it may be he says to go to the law to lay it on the altar to give it to the Lord and then get up from there walk away believe that it's dead recognize that you don't have it anymore walk away consider it did and the thing will leave you and when you have committed it to God the symptoms probably will still be there just as hard as it ever was but they're like vanities and the moment you pick it up again is yours right but if you if you leave it there and you walk away God can take care of the symptoms where the ram says and you put a seed in the ground and the next morning you go out dig it up and say my corn ain't growing yet put it back cover it up the next morning I see if it's going again it will never go like that no every time you dig it up you delay it is that right what do you do you know the Earth was made to grow the corn is that right or the seed and you plant the seed competitive the Earth and forget about it God does the rest of it well that's the way you do with the word of God you just plant it don't dig it up Just Keep On Believing it and commit it to God he makes it grow amen amen and the word of God is a seed and if you take God and His word you plant that seed you lay you lay it down if it will grow if you if you leave it and water it and let God allow God the chance to make it grow Jonah 2 verse 8 says they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy I mean and they're just lying vanities symptoms that lying manatees don't receive them don't have nothing to do with him if you look to them you're looking away from God we look at the Unseen not at what we see no one could look at what they see and be a Christian that's that's pretty powerful you've got to believe the things that's unseen for us by faith that you were healed not by sight or by feeling amen sorry a lot of reading today but the RAM says and I thought that's just about the way it is with people though the devil will put some old scarecrow out there and scare every dove in the country away if he can or every Eagle I might say if possible yes sir he'll do some old scarecrow and get everyone afraid you see and but to my surprise right on the arm of that scarecrow set two big healthy Birds just eating blackberries or strawberries do who wouldn't have it see and I thought that's right there's no condemnation to them that's in the patch that's one thing sure yes sir they why they didn't pay a bit more attention to that scarecrow than nothing they sit right there and just eat the same because it was strawberries and it was there for them and God blessed that man or woman who can walk around every unbelieving scarecrow that tries to point something this or that go right on into the patch because there's a good crop amen right in season to go into the pets now no condemnation to them big birds that can go right on him there and not be afraid of the Scarecrow amen uh somewhere around the mountain says uh when we one day in the Millennium we're going to sit below our juniper tree and we're going to laugh and we're going to be like how did I ever think I was not going to be I was not going to make it wow and and and it's it's true um you know we read earlier where brother Brandon sees the background of Satan was broken at Calvary yeah and everything that he's trying to put in front of you as a bluff as a scarecrow it's designed to keep you away from the good strawberries but he's yeah he's uh we can call his bluff and um just in closing I just want to give the developer and uh and just um just remind them and us where he's going with all his lies and and everything he's trying to do over the ages the Bible says how thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are they'll cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou said in thine heart I was Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and the size of the North I will Ascend above the highest of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophets are see and the devil that deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire in Brimstone day and night forever and uh you know when he attacks me I remind him that's where you're going it's not where I'm going you're attacking me now but but this is not where I'm going yeah I mean can we just bow our heads and just say whoever word of Prayer foreign Lord we just thank you Lord for Lord Jesus we know Lord in that day on Calvary Lord the Devil's Backbone was broken Lord and he's got nothing on us Lord and Lord we just pray Lord that you'll Shine Your Light your word Lord Jesus upon the situations in our lives Lord upon our hearts Lord and Minds Lord Jesus and Heavenly Father Lord we just Lord we know we know Satan's a liar Lord and we know your word is truth Lord and you cannot Prevail Lord and Lord we just we're just taking pray Lord that you'll help us Lord just that that you'll change our perspectives Lord to your perspective and the way we see things Lord to your perspective Lord it would help us not to look at ourselves Lord I pray and but to see us as you sees us Lord because you look you look through the blood Lord you just hear our voice you hear our prayers Lord we don't see us Lord you see the blood Lord we just thank you in Jesus name amen can we just have the musicians and um sing that song evidence let me just stand to our feet thank you okay [Music] oh my history [Music] in everything [Music] [Music] I see your promises all over my life all over my life [Music] um it was just about eight um and just uh yeah each one of us be out here so if there's if there's anyone you know it has to be it can just be as simple as touching the law like that woman that reached out and touched the hymn of his garden she just believes and she just reached out and touched them it wasn't she didn't work herself up or anything like that yeah I don't know if there's anyone here that maybe just me hearts was to come back to the Lord something they've been struggling with and I believe it's as easy as just laying it down saying Lord I'm not picking this up that's this thing up from this day forward I'll never pick it up again and even if those even if those symptoms keep assisting and even if it looks the same as it had right from the beginning the truth is he already defeated it that day on Calvary it was done back there the brother Graham says if you're sick he said to the Lord Lord please heal me you'll say I've already done it so he's already done it and you can just reach out and take that no matter if the symptoms are still there heavenly father will be just the Lord we've known all that it's faith that touches you lord it's not something formula or something or as faithful as either faith in your word Lord Jesus I just pray Lord that you're performing operation on our faith Lord Jesus that we can just Reach Out Lord and take a hold of every promise itself as Lord For It Is Ours Lord It's truth Lord and Lord Jesus you have you have broken me every Blackberry safety Lord as Believers well we don't have to live under our privileges Lord Jesus but although everyone hours Lord will I pray that you help us to reach out Lord and take hold of ourselves Lord and you said your Bible Lord that you strengthen those that are weak you strengthen the female needs more Lord I pray that you'll awaken the faith is already in our hearts through our prayers Lord we just committed to you Lord in Jesus name amen [Music] thank you foreign [Music] I see your promises I see your promises [Music] for the spirit I sing before we dismiss at the cross [Music] without the chorus let the cross at the cross [Music] [Music] [Music] that's the cross [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mercy [Music] of the day [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] happy birthday [Music] [Music] welcome [Music] back [Music] [Music] the doctor [Music] you'll remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it was there by faith everything [Music] we are [Applause] [Music] dismiss the name for what Jesus Christ but before we go if I could just call brother Ben [Music] yeah amen praise the Lord that was a real blessing so good to you know we take baptism for granted I think with such a fundamental thing of the scripture you know you see you read through the book of Acts as many as believe or baptized you know and cornelius's house in Acts chapter 10 they received the Holy Ghost like in the upper room they said can we forbid water saying they've received the Holy Ghost such as us so so you know Salvation and baptism is tied together because as many as believe were baptized and we know baptism as brother Dave said is a outward sign showing the inward work has been done so praise the Lord and straight As the gator Narrows the way so is it wonderful to enter into that gate and no brother Marion God bless you you know expose the devil expose them all day long you know it's like brother Graham said about the seals opening just it just strips them down expose them for what he is so you know I like that from Isaiah because it says there I don't know if you had the you keep reading down there it says and they that narrowly see him say is this the man that is weak the name weak in the Nations doesn't say everyone will see Satan for what he is but they're people who see him say is this really the guy that did all this and that's us because we see him for who he is in this day so amen so it's good to expose him and realize the Mind battles are they're just mind battles you know they're not you you know praise the Lord so and thanks thanks be to God we have victory over those things so yeah God bless you appreciate that brother Dave brother modion thank you so much um just one announcement um I'm so happy that the the Monday night prayer meeting people are coming you know people are interested and so on but we want to um you know it's good and I'm thankful for that and uh we talked about the Marion who who runs it and we've been wanting to maintain it in the same way it's always been so it's for the older youth so I'm very sorry younger ones but if uh but we've decided that the premier is going to be for those who are 15 and up if you're less than 15 and you want to have a prayer meeting and there's interest we can make one for you but that's just what we feel to do and if brother Mariano's not there then Jimmy is of course in charge but at the moment it's out of kapiti and things but yeah but God bless the prayer meeting God bless all those that go and pray and we appreciate the sincerity and and those things so that's just the on the announcement I have but um yeah so if you're under 15 and you want to have a prayer meeting then I'm sure we can arrange that somewhere but um yep and if you're 15 and up that would be part of the prayer meeting and sincerely go and yet the Lord will bless you and yeah God bless you so that's all I wanted to say but I'll put out a more of a thorough notice on the notice board but yeah God bless you all you're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord have a good week [Music] if we could all go back next door after the service clean up and then
