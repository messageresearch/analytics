[20:52] morning amen praise the Lord yes we do
[20:55] amen amen we're going to have a baby
[20:58] dedication this morning with little
[21:00] Ezekiel Al Alejandro for so do you want
[21:03] to is that right see close nearly not
[21:06] really aleandro I guess okay do you want
[21:09] to come forward though I mean let's sing
[21:11] that song as I come forward bring them
[21:13] in bring them in bring the little ones
[21:19] to
[21:20] Jesus bring them in bring them in bring
[21:26] the little to
[21:29] [Music]
[21:31] Jesus amen
[21:34] glory amen what a wonderful day what a
[21:36] wonderful time you know it's um it's
[21:40] it's such a tremendous thing when life
[21:41] comes into a family am we got a little
[21:43] bundle of joy here and um you know the
[21:46] Bible says that uh you as we follow the
[21:48] Bible way you know we don't baptize
[21:50] babies but we dedicate them to the Lord
[21:53] because the little ones came to Jesus
[21:54] and Jesus blessed them and we sure ain't
[21:57] the Lord Jesus but he still is the same
[21:58] God so just want to read uh just about
[22:02] his name because you know there's you
[22:03] know there's power in the name you know
[22:06] you notice that there's I've never met
[22:08] anyone called nabal in my life because
[22:10] nabal in the Bible means a fool you know
[22:12] I've never I've never met anyone called
[22:13] nabal you know says power in the name
[22:15] and um you know Ezekiel we know it means
[22:18] uh the strength of God and um alandro
[22:22] means defender of men or protector of
[22:25] mankind and I was thinking about eek in
[22:28] the Bible where you know he was would
[22:30] say in Ezekiel 24 and 24 that um I'll
[22:34] just read it here it says thus Ezekiel
[22:37] is unto you a sign according to all that
[22:39] he hath done shall ye do and when this
[22:41] cometh you shall know that I am the Lord
[22:44] God yeah so Ezekiel was a signed to to
[22:47] Israel and I pray that this Ezekiel will
[22:50] be a sign to this world that Jesus saves
[22:53] Jesus redeems that the power of the
[22:55] blood works you know that that people
[22:57] would see him uh in his life we see the
[23:00] Lord Jesus in his life and you know
[23:02] Ezekiel uh uh in in Chapter 2 of Ezekiel
[23:05] he was told by God to take a scroll and
[23:07] a vision and and and and eat it and it
[23:09] was sweet in his mouth and belly in his
[23:11] U sweet in his mouth and bitter in his
[23:13] belly there there's Ezekiel 2 and3 and
[23:15] we know it's the same with John as a
[23:17] symbol in the Book of Revelation he was
[23:18] a symbol of you and I and he was told in
[23:20] Revelations 10 take the book and eat it
[23:22] it'll be sweet in your mouth and belly
[23:23] in your bitter in your
[23:25] belly and so the words that is Ezekiel
[23:28] were told to speak to Israel was of Woe
[23:30] and lamentation and mourning but the
[23:32] word we have received is of joy and
[23:34] Redemption and salvation and eternal
[23:36] life so I pray that that that he'll
[23:38] become one with this word that and and
[23:41] and then his life will speak it forth
[23:42] under inspiration you his actions
[23:45] everything he does will be God and uh
[23:47] amen so that's my prayer for little
[23:50] Ezekiel so can I hold them you kind of
[23:52] forget how small they are
[23:54] right praise the Lord amen let's B our
[23:57] heads in a word of prayer shall we
[24:00] gracious father as we come to you this
[24:02] morning Lord with a little little

[42:48] we've got the ministers meeting after
[42:49] lunch before lunch depend how hungry all
[42:51] are but um amen I want to speak this
[42:54] morning on Redemption and complete
[42:56] completeness and in Joy amen amen it's
[42:58] one of the first messages I ever heard W
[43:01] and it's it's a real blessing and um
[43:05] amen so we're just going to go through
[43:06] this a little bit amen so we're going to
[43:07] go to Luke chapter
[43:09] 15
[43:11] um yeah actually um Christine I think a
[43:14] couple of weeks ago woke up with just
[43:15] those words Redemption and completeness
[43:16] and enjoy I thought I'm going to look
[43:17] into that again you know because you
[43:19] know we should be the happiest people in
[43:20] all the world irrespective of what we're
[43:22] going through the troubles we Face God
[43:24] is God and we are his children amen and
[43:26] we can just praise him no matter what so
[43:29] Amen to Luke Luke
[43:31] 15:1 yeah it's neat this whole we won't
[43:33] read this whole chapter but this whole
[43:35] chapter is about Redemption The Parables
[43:37] of redemption but it doesn't just show
[43:39] the joy of the one who saved it's the
[43:41] joy of the one who's redeemed that one
[43:43] back amen so then Drew near um unto him
[43:47] all the publicans and sinners for to
[43:49] hear him and the Pharisees and the
[43:51] scribes murmured saying this man
[43:53] receiveth Sinners and eateth with them
[43:55] and and he spake this Parable unto them
[43:57] saying what man of you having a anund
[44:00] sheep if he would lose one of them doth
[44:03] not leave the 9 and9 in the wilderness
[44:05] and go after that which is lost until he
[44:08] find it and when Heath found it he
[44:11] layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing
[44:13] Hallelujah and when he cometh home he
[44:16] calleth together his friends and
[44:17] neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with
[44:19] me for I have lost my sheep which was I
[44:21] mean sorry for I have found my sheep
[44:23] which was lost I say unto you that
[44:25] likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one
[44:28] sinner that repenteth more than over 99
[44:30] just persons which need no repentance
[44:34] Hallelujah I mean notice just here I
[44:36] mean just as you're turning to First
[44:37] Peter 1:7 you know it's the Shepherd
[44:39] that lays the sheep on his shoulders
[44:41] rejoicing amen the shepher doesn't say
[44:43] oh I finally found you and oh what a
[44:45] mission that was and look how grubby I
[44:47] am and look at the pain I had to go
[44:48] through no he's just happy he's got a
[44:50] sheep back amen it's like the Lord the
[44:52] joy that was sit before him when he went
[44:53] to Calvary was you and I redeemed amen
[44:56] amen he knew what he had to go through
[44:57] but the joy of you redeemed was far
[44:59] greater than what he had to endure amen
[45:01] so praise the Lord now first Peter
[45:05] 1:7 says that the trial of your faith
[45:07] being much more precious than of gold
[45:09] that perisheth though it be tried with
[45:11] fire might be found unto praise and
[45:14] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[45:15] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[45:19] love in whom though ye now you see him
[45:21] not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy
[45:24] unspeakable and full of Glory resending
[45:27] uh receiving the end of your faith even
[45:29] the salvation of your souls amen I trust
[45:32] you're in that condition today
[45:34] Hallelujah joy unspeakable full of glory
[45:36] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[45:37] prayer amen this morning shall we
[45:39] gracious father as we come into your
[45:41] presence this morning Lord we have
[45:43] Thanksgiving in our hearts because of
[45:44] what you have done and I just pray dear
[45:46] God that may you touch each life Lord
[45:48] Jesus as as as we're assembled here
[45:50] together I I pray Lord that we would see
[45:53] what you have done how you see what you
[45:55] have done
[45:56] Lord God and may we walk out of these
[45:58] doors change renewed transformed Lord
[46:00] may you grant it dear God may you lift
[46:02] burdens Lord may you set the captives
[46:04] free may you fill us with the Holy Ghost
[46:06] may may Faith rise in every heart Lord
[46:08] Jesus may you have your way and may you
[46:10] bless those who couldn't be here today
[46:11] as well be their portion father anyone
[46:13] who may be watching Lord in the name of
[46:15] Jesus Christ we commit the day and the
[46:16] service and ourselves into your hands
[46:18] and ask may your blood cover us all and
[46:20] may you have preeminence For Your Glory
[46:22] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen
[46:25] God bless you friends you may have your
[46:27] seats this morning so I want to talk
[46:29] about this uh redemption in completeness
[46:30] and en joy and it's really an experience
[46:33] that everyone must must uh experience
[46:35] amen so I pray if this comes across this
[46:37] Theory I pray it doesn't come across
[46:39] this Theory because amen I was there
[46:41] when it happened to me amen and you know
[46:44] it's amazing with Redemption how you
[46:45] know just just looking here with you
[46:47] know Redemption is to find that which
[46:49] was lost it's not it's not a replacement
[46:52] you know Redemption is not replacing
[46:53] something you've lost it's getting back
[46:55] that which you lost so just like the
[46:57] shepherd he lost one sheep he didn't
[46:58] just go buy another one he went to get
[47:00] that one that was lost it's the same
[47:02] thing with you and I friends he has come
[47:03] down upon the Earth to find that which
[47:06] was lost so you're in his thoughts in
[47:08] the beginning before the foundation of
[47:09] the world now you're born in sin shaped
[47:11] in iniquity come to World speaking lies
[47:12] you don't know who you are really you
[47:14] think you're from New Zealand or from
[47:16] Africa or wherever you think you're from
[47:18] but really you're from glory and that's
[47:19] why he comes down his word speaks to
[47:21] your heart like it does because he wants
[47:23] to open your eyes to see you came from
[47:25] me going back to me amen so Redemption
[47:28] is not replacement it is restoring that
[47:30] which was lost now there's just
[47:31] something about it when you think about
[47:33] how good our God is you know this joy
[47:35] unspeakable being full of Glory you know
[47:37] we have a joy that the world knows
[47:38] nothing about I wish they did know about
[47:40] it but they don't know about it you know
[47:42] we have a joy that is far Supreme
[47:44] compared to anything else I mean when
[47:46] you think about how he's coming back to
[47:47] receive us back to himself again to take
[47:49] us into Glory it's an incredible thing
[47:51] now this law of redemption we know God
[47:54] works by laws okay and and he has to
[47:56] work according to his laws
[47:58] now the um so so in Exodus is the first
[48:01] time it's not the scripture it's another
[48:03] one we'll get to us the first time the
[48:04] word redeem is ever used in the
[48:06] scripture uh this is in Exodus 6 but I'm
[48:08] just you I'm just saying in the book of
[48:09] Exodus it's used but now now notice this
[48:12] law here it says for the firstling of an
[48:15] ass shall thou redeem with a lamb and if
[48:17] thou redeem him not then Thou shalt
[48:19] break his neck all the firstborn of thy
[48:21] Sons shal thou redeem and None Shall
[48:23] appear before me empty so now we know
[48:26] that um this is not about a natural
[48:28] birth order anymore you know the uh we
[48:30] are all the Church of the firstborn and
[48:32] even even in the scripture how how how
[48:35] the younger received the blessing when
[48:36] Joseph took his two sons before his
[48:39] father and you know you know his father
[48:40] crossed his hands and the blessing that
[48:42] should have gone on the Elder son went
[48:44] upon the youngest son about Ephraim and
[48:45] Manassa and we know that through the
[48:47] cross the blessings that the Jews the
[48:49] firstborn should have received Came Upon
[48:51] Us Gentiles am mean so through the cross
[48:53] we received the blessing of the
[48:54] firstborn you know Esau being the
[48:57] firstborn had right to the birth right
[48:58] but Jacob really wanted it amen so you
[49:01] know so even though he was second born
[49:03] but we know now under the blood of Jesus
[49:04] Christ it's got nothing to do with the
[49:06] order you're born in a family I'm just
[49:08] saying that we are all the firstborn
[49:09] Sons and Daughters of God Amen so
[49:11] there's a law now God says I must redeem
[49:13] my children I cannot leave them
[49:15] unredeemed I must restore them back to
[49:18] their original state I cannot leave them
[49:20] lost in bondage under sin nature I
[49:22] cannot leave them in darkness I must
[49:24] redeem them
[49:26] that just puts the shouting in the in
[49:27] the day shouldn't it amen where God says
[49:29] I have to amen if God says he has to he
[49:32] will amen I'll say he has amen I'm so
[49:35] thankful that we're looking back to
[49:37] Calvary we're not looking forward to
[49:38] Calvary amen cuz there he purchased Us
[49:40] in completeness the Lord praise the Lord
[49:43] so it says here now and None Shall
[49:45] appear before me empty so none not one
[49:47] of his children is going to appear
[49:49] before him empty or in another um
[49:52] translation it says empty-handed amen
[49:54] we're not going to appear before him
[49:55] unrobed or naked as the Bible would say
[49:57] we're going to be robed in his
[49:58] righteousness we're going to be prepared
[50:00] to meet him on that day and you know if
[50:02] there's a joy unspeakable full of Glory
[50:04] in your soul when you think about the
[50:05] goodness of God you know you've know
[50:06] you've met him he's changed your life
[50:08] you can Rejoice saying I'm ready I mean
[50:10] the Lord has made me ready amen so we
[50:12] can we can go shouting and rejoicing the
[50:14] rest of our days amen because we've been
[50:16] redeemed in completeness and in Joy yes
[50:19] sir not a partial Redemption not just a
[50:21] down payment on Redemption no we've been
[50:23] redeemed in completeness and in joy if
[50:25] the devil's fighting you this morning
[50:27] remind them I've been redeemed in
[50:28] completeness and in Joy amen because if
[50:31] there's joy it means you've been
[50:32] redeemed completely amen because there's
[50:34] always a manifestation of what God has
[50:36] done it's not just a head knowledge of
[50:38] that's a nice idea it becomes a reality
[50:40] that's right amen so it becomes a
[50:42] reality now this is such an incredible
[50:44] thing it says even says that the
[50:45] firstborn of a donkey of an ass Thou
[50:47] shalt redeem you know and it doesn't
[50:50] matter you know if you think about it it
[50:52] doesn't matter of the condition of that
[50:53] donkey it may be knocked knee cross side
[50:55] the worst looking little baby donkey
[50:57] you'd ever see but you know and and you
[50:59] know that you know that baby donkey may
[51:01] have a right to be afraid see the
[51:03] brother you know will it be redeemed or
[51:05] not now brother Bram says the trouble
[51:07] the church is scared oh I'm afraid of
[51:10] this don't be afraid you say oh if I can
[51:13] just it isn't you it's him I'm not
[51:16] worthy of healing sure you're not I'm
[51:17] not nobody's not or rather nobody is but
[51:20] he's the one it's not our worthiness
[51:22] it's his goodness to us see Hallelujah
[51:25] in the old Covenant what if a little
[51:27] mule would have been born out of a
[51:28] pasture some night I don't know whether
[51:30] you ever um farmed any or not but this
[51:32] mule was born with flopped ear and a
[51:34] horri horrible mule to begin with he was
[51:36] knocked kned he was crosseyed his tail
[51:38] sticks right straight up what a horrible
[51:40] looking mule now if he could look around
[51:42] to his mamy he'd say you know what as
[51:45] soon as the Master of the House comes
[51:46] out he'll knock me in the head I'm not
[51:48] even worth the eat of the food I eat I
[51:51] am no good now this is this is the
[51:53] condition people get in as as is they
[51:55] think I'm worthless I'm useless I failed
[51:57] I'm no good I've never amount to a hell
[51:59] of beans or anything but we but you but
[52:01] there the problem we look at ourselves
[52:03] see you got to turn your eyes away from
[52:06] you to him I mean because you will
[52:08] disappoint yourself 24/7 we're human
[52:10] right but if you look to him he never
[52:13] disappoints amen he never disappoints
[52:15] amen so keep your eyes upon him but see
[52:18] but now notice now but if his mommy was
[52:20] really instructed she'd say wait a
[52:22] minute son just a minute I'm going to
[52:24] tell you something you don't
[52:26] know that's what I want to tell you you
[52:29] see you don't know who you are son you
[52:31] see you were born under a Birthright
[52:34] amen you were born under a Birthright
[52:36] friends amen and then the master of the
[52:38] house I don't care what you look like
[52:40] when the Master of the House comes out
[52:41] to see he's got a new Mo new mule born
[52:45] then the thing he has to do is get a
[52:46] lamb without a blemish and take that
[52:48] perfect lamb and that perfect lamb dies
[52:50] so you can live I mean then the little
[52:52] little mule can kick up his heels and
[52:54] have a big time hallelujah amen well
[52:56] that's the way it is with us we're
[52:58] imperfect no good born in sin shaped in
[53:00] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[53:02] we're no good to begin with but God
[53:03] don't look at you look at what God don't
[53:06] look at he don't look at you we look at
[53:08] you ourselves but God don't look at you
[53:09] amen he looks at the sacrifice he looks
[53:12] at the lamb he doesn't see you because
[53:13] he sees Christ Jesus died for you
[53:16] Hallelujah I'm talking about Redemption
[53:18] here he he doesn't look at you he looks
[53:20] at the sacrifice see we've got to get
[53:22] our eyes off ourselves see this is the
[53:24] problem this is the this is the selfie
[53:26] generation amen you can have real time
[53:28] people can I don't know if they do I
[53:29] haven't been looking and I wouldn't
[53:30] advise it but I don't know maybe some
[53:32] people live like The Truman Show they
[53:34] live stream their lives all the time
[53:36] it's all about me me me me me no no it
[53:38] should be all about him him him him him
[53:40] right because we get our eyes on
[53:41] ourselves we'll be disappointed but look
[53:43] to him look at your Redeemer look at the
[53:46] one who has brought you back amen who
[53:47] has restored you back to your original
[53:49] position but you see now you judge
[53:51] yourself by the way you treat God's
[53:53] propitiation Therefore your sin see he
[53:56] you judge yourselves you don't judge him
[53:58] just enough to forgive you see if you
[54:00] think he'll forgive you confess your
[54:01] faults and he'll forgive you see so so
[54:04] so you judge yourself by the way you
[54:05] treat God's propitiation by his by the
[54:08] way you treat his lamb is it enough it's
[54:12] actually more than enough his blood is
[54:14] more than enough am mean it's not just
[54:16] enough it's not just a even no no it's
[54:18] more than enough you know the greater
[54:20] than sign and physics it's always
[54:22] whatever's going to be chewed up oh no
[54:24] whatever is greater is never less than
[54:27] what's less where the sign is right the
[54:29] greater than okay his blood is greater
[54:32] than sin amen his blood is greater than
[54:34] any problem his holy spirit is a greater
[54:36] comforter than any trouble amen he's
[54:39] always greater than Hallelujah so so
[54:42] you're judging Yourself by the way you
[54:43] treat God's propitiation see if this
[54:45] mule did not judge see see if the mule
[54:49] did not believe his mama and did not
[54:52] believe that the lamb was good enough to
[54:53] be a propitiation for his birth amen he
[54:56] wouldn't be kicking up and having a good
[54:57] time see his life that he lived was a
[55:00] manifestation of how he judged himself
[55:02] based on Amen by the way he would treat
[55:05] God's propitiation see so if he judged
[55:07] himself now redeemed because of the Lamb
[55:10] he kicked up and have a big time you
[55:11] follow me today amen so you see it's how
[55:14] you treat God's
[55:15] sacrifice amen we should treat it with
[55:17] the utmost respect and Thanksgiving and
[55:19] reverence amen cuz when I could not go
[55:22] where to to where he was he came to
[55:24] where I was amen amen he came to me here
[55:26] in this world of darkness and praise God
[55:28] I'm so thankful for that
[55:30] now amen we know that we are not
[55:33] redeemed under the blood of bulls and
[55:34] goats but we are we have Redemption
[55:37] through the blood of Jesus Christ the
[55:39] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[55:40] riches of his grace so now when I talk
[55:42] about the Old Testament bring it to the
[55:44] new remember we're under a far greater
[55:45] Covenant than than the old amen we're
[55:47] not under the blood of a natural lamb
[55:49] amen that cannot change a person take
[55:51] sin nature out of them but we're under
[55:53] the supernatural blood of Jesus Christ
[55:55] Christ amen it doesn't just forgive sins
[55:57] it takes it far away and it takes the
[55:59] sin nature out of the person praise the
[56:01] Lord amen we are the Church of the
[56:03] firstborn I'm just dropping these things
[56:04] in to show you we are to the general
[56:06] assembly this is where we've come to to
[56:08] the general assembly and the Church of
[56:10] the firstborn which are wrot in heaven
[56:12] see God wants you to realize your name
[56:14] is written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[56:16] that he put on there before the
[56:17] foundation of the world see this is what
[56:19] Redemption is he's got a book he's got a
[56:21] book of names amen he knows when they'll
[56:23] be born how they'll be born all those
[56:25] different things and then he goes
[56:26] searching hunting out for those names
[56:28] for in a certain season of their lives
[56:30] you may be young you may be old but
[56:32] there's a certain season when he's going
[56:33] to meet you amen and he because he wants
[56:36] to reveal himself to you he wants you to
[56:38] know that you are his you're not the
[56:40] Devils you never were you're his amen
[56:43] child of mine don't you know you belong
[56:45] to me amen that you know should be the
[56:47] question I pray that we should yes Lord
[56:49] I do know amen amen
[56:52] so we can Rejoice the this
[56:56] morning
[56:58] see people see people ask the question
[57:03] do they have the Holy Ghost or not the
[57:05] question really should be not you
[57:07] shouldn't stop there but do you believe
[57:09] it's for you you know I don't know if he
[57:12] died for me well but do you believe it's
[57:14] for you you know because people get
[57:16] stuck in this well do I have it or not
[57:17] no do you believe it's for you if you
[57:19] believe it's for you you can step out in
[57:21] faith and claim it amen because we got
[57:24] to realize that Everything Everything
[57:26] Jesus did was finished that day on
[57:28] Calvary he says he says in the meeting
[57:30] my meeting has never been able uh never
[57:33] been to a place to where I've tried to
[57:35] make the people think that there was
[57:36] something that God had given me a little
[57:38] special towards healing someone that's
[57:39] an error God has given no one any powers
[57:43] to heal someone healing comes by faith
[57:45] alone and faith in a work that's already
[57:48] been done a finished work that Christ
[57:50] did at Calvary it's so much like this if
[57:53] I was starving for food and one loaf of
[57:56] bread would save my life and you passed
[57:58] by in the country somewhere and you seen
[58:00] me starving and you say brother Bram are
[58:02] you hungry I'd say I'll die shortly if I
[58:04] do not have some bread and you reach
[58:06] into your pocket and give me 25 cents
[58:08] and you say brother Brown this is the
[58:10] purchase power of a loaf of bread now I
[58:12] reach out and receive the 25 cents now
[58:14] if you tell me that and I just imagine
[58:17] I've got 25 cents I'm only deceiving
[58:18] myself I've got to hold the 25 cents of
[58:21] my possession the 25 cents is the faith
[58:23] that you have to
[58:25] have faith is a common thing yeah
[58:28] remember it was a weed a common weed
[58:30] that they took and applied the blood on
[58:31] the door in lint and in the first Exodus
[58:34] it was such a common thing you imagine
[58:36] all these weeds that are growing out
[58:37] here take that apply the blood and you
[58:39] will have salvation this is this is a
[58:42] natural this is how common faith is
[58:44] right that's why you think 25 cents it's
[58:46] not a lot of money right it's not a
[58:49] million dollars it's something that
[58:50] actually we I'm sure we all would have
[58:52] 25 cents to get what we need to live
[58:55] naturally now now I believe we have
[58:57] faith of that value which is enough for
[59:00] what we have need of amen amen now sorry
[59:04] I got to find my place again I can just
[59:05] be as happy with that 25 cents as I
[59:07] could be with a loaf of bread in my hand
[59:09] I can Rejoice just as much when you give
[59:12] me the 25 cents as you give me the loaf
[59:14] of bread because I have the purchased
[59:16] power of the loaf of bread and I know
[59:17] there's plenty of bread for sale and
[59:19] when I have faith that God is going to
[59:21] keep his word though I'm not healed at
[59:23] the present time I know that God has
[59:24] plenty of healing power and I've got
[59:26] faith to bring it to me I'm just as
[59:28] happy with the faith that says you're
[59:29] going to be well as you would be if you
[59:32] were sound and well at that minute that
[59:34] makes no difference because you've
[59:36] already possessed it faith is a
[59:38] substance not a make belief if you
[59:40] holding it uh not in your but but you're
[59:43] holding not in your hand but in the
[59:45] possession of your heart you have
[59:47] purchased power of your healing right so
[59:50] if you can look straight into Calvary
[59:51] and see he has redeeming and
[59:53] completeness there and it's revealed to
[59:55] you you're just as happy with the
[59:57] purchasing power of that Faith than
[59:59] having the thing right now amen See
[1:00:01] Redemption Redemption is a very powerful
[1:00:04] thing now I'm sorry if this feels like
[1:00:06] we're just trudging along a bit but
[1:00:07] we'll get somewhere now he would say he
[1:00:10] would say in Exodus chapter 6 is the
[1:00:12] first time this this word is used
[1:00:14] speaking to Israel uh speaking to Moses
[1:00:16] bringing uh Israel out of Egypt and I
[1:00:19] have also heard the groaning of the
[1:00:20] children of Israel whom the Egyptians
[1:00:22] kept keep in bondage and I have remember
[1:00:24] remembered my Covenant wherefore say
[1:00:26] unto the children of Israel I am the
[1:00:28] Lord and I'll bring you out from under
[1:00:30] the burdens of the Egyptians and I'll
[1:00:32] rid you out of their bondage and I'll
[1:00:33] redeem you with an outstretched arm and
[1:00:36] with great judgments amen so this word
[1:00:38] Redeemer means to be according to an
[1:00:41] oriental law it's you it's one of
[1:00:43] kinship where there's a law in the Bible
[1:00:45] of the kinsman redeemer where where
[1:00:47] where someone who is who is a relative
[1:00:50] who has to so just say if I sold myself
[1:00:52] into slavery CU I had to because of a
[1:00:54] debt I couldn't pay one of my relatives
[1:00:57] had to be a blood relation of course
[1:00:59] they could come and redeem me out of
[1:01:01] that slavery they had to be related to
[1:01:03] me they had to have the purchasing power
[1:01:05] and they had to have the will to do it
[1:01:07] amen and that's what our lord Jesus did
[1:01:09] he you know he changed from from from
[1:01:11] from great eternal spirit to man he
[1:01:14] changed his form right so he became kin
[1:01:17] folks to one of us he came one of us am
[1:01:20] mean in order to fulfill his law of
[1:01:21] kinsman redeemer Amen to to to Ransom us
[1:01:25] out of the grip of sin amen so so this
[1:01:28] is this is what this redeeming is it's
[1:01:30] to see see when Israel got into slavery
[1:01:33] in Egypt God didn't find another people
[1:01:35] he didn't just start somewhere else no
[1:01:37] he said the people that have gone down
[1:01:39] into slavery I'm going to bring them out
[1:01:40] I'm going to redeem them back I'm going
[1:01:42] to fulfill my promises I'm going to
[1:01:44] remember my Covenant see when you begin
[1:01:46] to cry out to God about trouble and
[1:01:48] bondage and things the devil's trying to
[1:01:49] do in your life God remembers his
[1:01:51] Covenant with you am mean God remembers
[1:01:53] his word at cause them to come on the
[1:01:56] scene praise the Lord amen so I will
[1:01:58] redeem you so I'm going to I'm going to
[1:02:00] bring you know I'm going to buy you back
[1:02:01] I'm going to you know I'm going to I'm
[1:02:04] going to I'm going to restore you back
[1:02:05] to your original
[1:02:07] estate amen now this is this is where
[1:02:10] see men are in this earth to be Sons and
[1:02:12] Daughters of God and when you've
[1:02:14] wandered out in sin they're out of their
[1:02:16] original conditions and the Holy Ghost
[1:02:18] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:19] redeems them back in their right
[1:02:20] position to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:02:23] Amen Redemption brought back a man said
[1:02:25] one time said brother Bram to redeem me
[1:02:27] says the devil put me in the porn chop
[1:02:29] and the Lord Jesus redeemed me I thought
[1:02:30] that was pretty cute and right too that
[1:02:32] the devil put you in the porn chop but
[1:02:34] Jesus come and redeemed you amen so so
[1:02:37] it's like it you know for example I
[1:02:39] don't go when I go pick up my kids from
[1:02:41] school you know I don't go buy them out
[1:02:42] of there but you know I don't just go to
[1:02:44] school and pick any children you know I
[1:02:47] could go into a classroom and say Well
[1:02:48] they're the right age they look about
[1:02:49] the right height the right color
[1:02:51] whatever more you know they're girls or
[1:02:54] they're a boy so I'll just take them no
[1:02:55] no I go looking for them I go to school
[1:02:58] with a specific Mission my children are
[1:03:00] there I'm going to redeem them out of
[1:03:02] the yok of the teacher amen I'm going to
[1:03:04] I'm going to set them free Hallelujah
[1:03:06] the Liberty Bell Rings and they have to
[1:03:08] come out amen I say the Liberty Bell is
[1:03:09] ringing amen of the blood of Jesus
[1:03:11] Christ amen the Lord Has Come not just
[1:03:13] to find anybody but to find you Amen to
[1:03:17] find his children amen so when I go to
[1:03:19] school sometimes I've walked in there
[1:03:21] and they're still facing the teacher
[1:03:22] they can't see me but I see them I say
[1:03:24] you're coming with me amen and then the
[1:03:26] bow goes and they walk out like the Lord
[1:03:28] many times he sees you well before you
[1:03:30] see him right amen like the story that
[1:03:33] you know you know the eagle egg how the
[1:03:35] farmer you know he went to an eagle nest
[1:03:36] he took one of the eggs put it under his
[1:03:38] chicken chicken in his chicken C you
[1:03:40] know and that eagle was born and he's
[1:03:42] you know trying to be like a chicken
[1:03:44] he's trying to be like what he sees but
[1:03:47] but you know he's not an ugly duckling
[1:03:48] but he's an ugly duckling he doesn't fit
[1:03:50] in something in him just doesn't fit in
[1:03:52] he tries them with the jocks and the
[1:03:53] Nerds and the in and the whatever Emos I
[1:03:56] know what's going on these days and you
[1:03:58] know he just doesn't fit in in those
[1:03:59] kind of places and but you but then mama
[1:04:02] mama really knows because she comes back
[1:04:04] to the nest and she says there's one egg
[1:04:06] here this is wrong I had two I want my
[1:04:10] two amen one's not enough 50% you know
[1:04:13] God don't God don't do a pass Mark he
[1:04:15] does 100% I mean he does all amen he has
[1:04:19] 100% with honors right so then mama you
[1:04:21] know you know that baby hatches but then
[1:04:22] on her you know you know in the nest but
[1:04:24] then in in in Mama's mind she's thinking
[1:04:27] but I have two and if this one's born
[1:04:30] that other one will be born somewhere
[1:04:32] then she starts hunting amen it's the
[1:04:34] same thing with our Lord how he begins
[1:04:36] to brood over the Earth looking for you
[1:04:40] and then that little that little Eagle
[1:04:41] there in the barnyard you know maybe
[1:04:43] picked on by the other you know chickens
[1:04:45] and you know made fun of and all these
[1:04:47] things and you know beaten down but then
[1:04:49] one day it's out in the barnyard and and
[1:04:51] you know it's trying to pick around
[1:04:52] trying to find something and then all
[1:04:54] the chicken starts scattering scared to
[1:04:56] death and then a shadow passes over it
[1:04:59] of Mama Eagle Hallelujah and then he
[1:05:01] looks up and then he sees mama mama saw
[1:05:04] him a long before long time before he
[1:05:06] ever saw Mama and then Mama looks down
[1:05:08] and just screams saying come up here my
[1:05:11] son you don't belong I'm going to redeem
[1:05:13] you out of the chicken yard I mean but
[1:05:15] you got to realize that God put a life
[1:05:16] in you to fly out of the chicken yard I
[1:05:19] mean because the same life that's in
[1:05:20] mama was in the baby I mean because why
[1:05:23] you because look down see the same
[1:05:25] potentials to fly in the heavenlies like
[1:05:27] Mama was already in the baby see we
[1:05:29] don't become Sons and Daughters by the
[1:05:31] new birth we receive the new birth
[1:05:33] because we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:35] Amen so so so M so so he looks up to her
[1:05:38] and says how do I get up there mama and
[1:05:40] and she just says stop flopping your
[1:05:42] wings I maybe you started flopping and
[1:05:44] you got onto a fence rail you're
[1:05:46] justified by faith and that felt pretty
[1:05:47] good but it wasn't up there yet you
[1:05:49] flopped again you got onto the top of
[1:05:51] the chicken Co you know all the other
[1:05:53] chickens all your friends y peer
[1:05:54] pressure is a
[1:05:55] demon peer pressure wants to keep you
[1:05:58] all the same you know and it's really
[1:06:00] friends who aren't friends just want to
[1:06:02] get something out of you that's why they
[1:06:04] want you around they see value in your
[1:06:07] friendship and that's peer pressure you
[1:06:09] know it's like the people there in uh
[1:06:11] wherever it was in the book of Acts how
[1:06:13] there was that you know there was that
[1:06:14] girl or that woman there with that with
[1:06:16] that Spirit of Enchantment you you would
[1:06:18] you would follow around Paul saying
[1:06:20] these men show us the way of Salvation
[1:06:22] you know and she was just used by her
[1:06:24] by those men that controlled her just to
[1:06:26] make some money and friends will do the
[1:06:28] same thing with you see they weren't
[1:06:30] rejoicing I'm so thankful she's free now
[1:06:32] I'm so thankful she doesn't tear herself
[1:06:34] and scream and do bunch of crazy stuff
[1:06:36] no they're upset because what they got
[1:06:39] out of her they couldn't get out of her
[1:06:40] anymore cuz she was free it's the same
[1:06:42] thing with fake friendships people just
[1:06:44] are your friend because they want
[1:06:45] something out of you and that's why
[1:06:48] people get upset when you come to the
[1:06:49] Lord because because whatever influence
[1:06:51] they have upon you to get what they want
[1:06:52] is broken
[1:06:54] so now these little chickens are crying
[1:06:56] out you know come to safety come to
[1:06:57] safety but that little baby saying no I
[1:07:00] belong up there I belong up there and
[1:07:02] then and then and then and then she just
[1:07:03] says you just flap your wings one more
[1:07:05] time I'll swoop down and catch you am
[1:07:07] mean so so so he jumped off that he in
[1:07:09] faith he jumped off the chicken coop
[1:07:11] knowing that she would catch her and
[1:07:12] then she swooped down caught him and fle
[1:07:15] up into the heavenlies what happened the
[1:07:17] baby was restored back from where he
[1:07:19] fell from back from where he was taken
[1:07:21] from We're taken by sin into this world
[1:07:24] Amen but God has come to catch us and
[1:07:26] take us back up again that's right
[1:07:28] hallelujah amen so amen Lord amen and
[1:07:32] that's what the Lord you know see Satan
[1:07:33] put us in the porn shop just as
[1:07:35] something to be traded but God came to
[1:07:38] get us out amen I mean we are not a
[1:07:40] commodity in God's kingdom we're not
[1:07:42] just something see the devil uses people
[1:07:44] destroys them sends them to Hell once
[1:07:46] he's done with them that's what he does
[1:07:47] he choose them up splits them out that's
[1:07:49] what this world has done choose people
[1:07:50] up spits them out I'm sure we can all
[1:07:53] agree us who came out of it what did it
[1:07:55] do it chewed us up it spat us out amen
[1:07:59] but God didn't come to just to chew us
[1:08:00] up and spit no he came to heal us
[1:08:02] restore us make us whole show us who we
[1:08:04] really are amen and once he has lived
[1:08:07] through us he takes us back he takes us
[1:08:09] to our reward amen I feel like I'm
[1:08:11] shouting a bit but I'm not shouting at
[1:08:13] you I'm just happy okay but you know you
[1:08:15] see you see he's Tak you know he takes
[1:08:16] us to our reward down Redemption we know
[1:08:19] is to buy back that which was lost now
[1:08:21] Redemption I said is incompleteness yeah
[1:08:24] and um I think this is Webster says it's
[1:08:27] completeness means having all necessary
[1:08:29] Parts elements or steps Glory there what
[1:08:32] Redemption it's not a partial Redemption
[1:08:34] you're going to realize if you're under
[1:08:35] the blood of Jesus Christ this morning
[1:08:37] you're not sometimes the devils and
[1:08:39] sometimes Gods doesn't matter what the
[1:08:41] devil tries to tell you because the
[1:08:42] devil he puts thoughts and mind Batts
[1:08:44] and troubles in our minds and he tries
[1:08:46] to say well you belong to me because you
[1:08:47] got a mind battle now you got a mind
[1:08:49] battle because you're still in this body
[1:08:51] right but he but the devil can't touch
[1:08:53] your soul amen right he can't touch your
[1:08:55] soul the Eternal part of you he can't
[1:08:57] get that Soul he can strike you with
[1:08:58] sickness it doesn't mean you're not a
[1:09:00] Believer he can put a mind battle in
[1:09:02] your spirit doesn't mean you're not a
[1:09:03] Believer right but he'll try and make
[1:09:05] you think you're not a Believer because
[1:09:07] you have those things but you just got
[1:09:09] to put it back in the devil's face say
[1:09:11] no my soul's been redeemed by the by the
[1:09:12] blood of Jesus Christ amen so so this
[1:09:15] Redemption is not a partial Redemption
[1:09:18] it's not a shared custody between you
[1:09:20] and I mean I mean between God and the
[1:09:22] devil where they've negotiated some term
[1:09:24] no God says they're mine they have no
[1:09:26] part in you you have no part in them I'm
[1:09:29] going to prove it to you Satan they are
[1:09:31] my children I'm not going to lose one of
[1:09:33] them they cannot be lost am amen so this
[1:09:36] Redemption is in completeness just like
[1:09:37] when um Abraham would would purchase I
[1:09:40] think it's the first property sale
[1:09:41] that's recorded there in the Bible where
[1:09:43] he purchases that field from the
[1:09:45] children of Heth to bury his wife Sarah
[1:09:48] and he and he defines the boundaries of
[1:09:49] that place cuz he doesn't want any
[1:09:51] dispute on that piece of ground he says
[1:09:53] this is this is the bearing place for my
[1:09:55] wife amen so so so that was and then he
[1:09:58] paid for it in full the price they got
[1:10:01] um required was the price he paid he
[1:10:03] didn't say well I'll come back and pay
[1:10:05] off the interest no he paid it in full
[1:10:07] before she was ever buried amen it's a
[1:10:09] same thing when our lord Jesus died on
[1:10:11] Calvary he purchased a burying place I
[1:10:14] mean a place of safety that not just
[1:10:15] when we die we're safe there but when
[1:10:17] we're alive we come under the blood of
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ and we're safe amen he has
[1:10:21] made borders of this place that the
[1:10:23] devil has no claim on you when you're
[1:10:25] under the blood amen praise God
[1:10:27] hallelujah amen so you know it's so so
[1:10:29] it's it's it's it has all the
[1:10:32] parts praise the Lord as you know this
[1:10:34] is one of my favorite scriptures in
[1:10:36] Colossians and you being dead in your
[1:10:38] sins and and the uncircumcision of your
[1:10:41] flesh hath he quickened together with
[1:10:43] him having forgiven you all I like that
[1:10:45] word all
[1:10:47] trespasses amen having forgiven you all
[1:10:50] let's say that all all trespasses
[1:10:54] I mean blotting out the handwriting of
[1:10:56] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:10:58] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:11:00] way nailing it to his cross and having
[1:11:02] spoiled principalities and Powers he
[1:11:04] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:11:07] over them in it amen so when Jesus went
[1:11:10] down to hell he took the keys of Hell
[1:11:12] death and the grave of Satan amen he see
[1:11:14] under the blood of balls and goats that
[1:11:16] was a mighty uh redemption in Shadow but
[1:11:19] the reality is far greater amen amen
[1:11:22] when we realize that truly he has loved
[1:11:24] us and washed us from our sins in his
[1:11:27] own blood amen amen so he's taken them
[1:11:29] away from us as far as the east as from
[1:11:31] the West amen he's taken them and put
[1:11:34] them in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:11:36] that is so deep the Bible says even the
[1:11:38] adders can't get down there am me so the
[1:11:40] bottom of that sea is so deep the devil
[1:11:42] can't get in amen he can't those sins
[1:11:44] are gone and it even gets better than
[1:11:47] that because you know someone's going to
[1:11:48] have to answer for that sin and it ain't
[1:11:51] you amen if it's confessed under the
[1:11:53] blood of Jesus Jesus that's what I'm
[1:11:54] saying Redemption and completeness and
[1:11:56] en Joy see we don't go from this life
[1:11:59] praising God knowing we're redeemed to
[1:12:01] the next World wondering if we're going
[1:12:02] to make it or not see this Redemption
[1:12:04] goes through every Dimension amen it
[1:12:07] goes from here to Glory right Hallelujah
[1:12:10] it still stands on the other side as
[1:12:12] well see it's not just well am I going
[1:12:13] to make it no if you've been redeemed in
[1:12:15] completeness and in joy you can stand
[1:12:17] and say praise God Lorden if I my if
[1:12:21] this is my last breath my next breath is
[1:12:23] is going to take me to the presence of
[1:12:24] the one I love and I'm going to stand
[1:12:27] undefiled redeemed washed in his blood I
[1:12:30] don't have to fear going through that
[1:12:32] portal of death amen that's right praise
[1:12:35] the Lord the Lord now brother Ram says
[1:12:37] it says now when man before he sinned
[1:12:39] I'm closing but don't you miss this I'm
[1:12:40] not closing I'm halfway but don't you
[1:12:42] miss this when man sinned he separated
[1:12:44] himself from God and crossed the great
[1:12:46] Chasm and put himself and Death on this
[1:12:48] side he left there's no way back exactly
[1:12:51] there's no way for him to get back but
[1:12:53] when he did he accepted a God sorry
[1:12:55] accepted a substitute which was a lamb
[1:12:56] or a goat or a sheep or something for
[1:12:58] blood which Adam spoke of or Abel spoke
[1:13:01] of on the other side of the chasm on
[1:13:03] that side he's a Son of God he's an
[1:13:04] offspring of God he is an inheritance of
[1:13:07] the earth he can control nature he can
[1:13:09] speak into existence why he's a Creator
[1:13:11] himself he's an offspring of God but
[1:13:13] when he crossed he separated his sunship
[1:13:16] so he left the sunship position he's a
[1:13:18] sinner by Nature he's under the hands
[1:13:20] and Dominion of Satan and God took a
[1:13:22] sacrifice as a chemical of the blood but
[1:13:24] the blood of balls and goats did not
[1:13:26] divorce sin it only covered sin if
[1:13:28] you've got a red spot on your hand and
[1:13:30] cover it with white the red spot's still
[1:13:32] there see it's still there but God went
[1:13:34] down from heaven a bleach for sin it was
[1:13:36] the blood of his own son that when out
[1:13:39] confess and drops into God's bleach try
[1:13:41] to find it again am That's The Power of
[1:13:44] confession from a sincere heart try to
[1:13:45] find it again you won't be able to find
[1:13:47] it the coloring of sin goes back through
[1:13:49] the mediators and down through time
[1:13:51] until it hits the accused of Satan and
[1:13:53] lays on him to the till the day of the
[1:13:56] Judgment I that's why I said someone's
[1:13:58] going to pay for it someone's got to
[1:13:59] answer for the sin and it's not you now
[1:14:01] all the sins that the devil made you do
[1:14:03] when you're unconverted they go upon the
[1:14:06] head of the enemy and he's got to answer
[1:14:08] for those things and not just the past
[1:14:11] ones but the present and the future ones
[1:14:13] hallelujah amen now now if our sins lays
[1:14:17] upon the accuser till the day of the
[1:14:18] Judgment then what happens to you and I
[1:14:21] what happens to the son he becomes in
[1:14:23] perfect fellowship with the father again
[1:14:25] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:14:27] with no remembrance of sin against him
[1:14:29] no more there is no more stain of bleach
[1:14:32] can be seen anywhere he is free
[1:14:34] Hallelujah just as that clorax or that
[1:14:36] ink can never be ink no more because
[1:14:38] it's broke up and sent back again and
[1:14:40] when confessed sin is confessed and
[1:14:43] being dipped into a man or woman that's
[1:14:44] been dipped into the blood of Jesus
[1:14:46] Christ it kills all symptoms and every
[1:14:48] molecule of sin goes back to the devil
[1:14:50] laid on him to the day of judgment where
[1:14:53] he is he where his eternal destination
[1:14:55] will be thrown into a lake of fire and
[1:14:57] the chasm is bridged and never to come
[1:14:59] in remembrance no more a man stand
[1:15:02] stands justifies the Son of God he says
[1:15:05] Simplicity Hallelujah that's your
[1:15:07] condition if you're under the blood of
[1:15:08] Jesus Christ amen amen that's so isn't
[1:15:11] that wonderful you see when the Lord
[1:15:13] Jesus bowed his head that down Calvary
[1:15:15] and said it is finished he said exactly
[1:15:18] what he meant I've paid it in full just
[1:15:20] like Abraham buying the bearing place
[1:15:22] for Sarah it's been fully purchased I've
[1:15:24] ransomed my children I've bought them
[1:15:26] back I've atoned for their sin amen it
[1:15:29] is finished now I pray we could just
[1:15:32] look at Calvary the way he looks at it
[1:15:34] amen because through the Lord's eyes it
[1:15:36] is finished it was done that day and I
[1:15:38] Pray by faith we could look at Calvary
[1:15:40] the same way and see it is finished amen
[1:15:43] the sin question's been settled amen the
[1:15:45] argument's over amen the discussion's
[1:15:47] done my Lord Jesus has redeemed me in
[1:15:50] completeness amen amen and en Joy amen
[1:15:53] hallelujah now the wonderful thing about
[1:15:55] this Redemption is that is that what it
[1:15:57] purchases you can live on it for the
[1:16:00] rest of your days amen just like the
[1:16:02] just like the widow woman went to Elisha
[1:16:05] and she had two sons that were going to
[1:16:06] be sold as slaves because they were
[1:16:08] under a debt they couldn't pay just like
[1:16:09] we were under a debt we couldn't
[1:16:12] pay and then and then so she knew she
[1:16:15] didn't have the money to cover her dead
[1:16:18] husband's debt she knew it was done in
[1:16:20] the morning her sons are going to be
[1:16:21] taken and be become slaves but then she
[1:16:24] went to the prophet said what shall I do
[1:16:27] and then so now the woman you know was
[1:16:29] instructed by the prophet go borrow all
[1:16:31] the vessels you can find from the
[1:16:32] neighbors put them into your house close
[1:16:34] all the windows and doors and that
[1:16:36] little that little jar of oil you have
[1:16:39] that one you have which you think is
[1:16:41] insignificant take it and fill every one
[1:16:44] of them now I've never I've never taken
[1:16:47] a vessel and poured it into another and
[1:16:51] just say just say the other jars would
[1:16:52] have been a lot
[1:16:53] bigger and you she took that jar how big
[1:16:56] it was and you pour it and it doesn't
[1:16:58] get lighter as you pour and then what's
[1:17:00] in here was Far bigger than what should
[1:17:02] be in here right but this was now
[1:17:04] Redemption because redemption in action
[1:17:07] because she was going to because the
[1:17:10] prophet instructed her to do this that
[1:17:12] now her sons going to be redeemed they
[1:17:14] were going to be redeemed from that debt
[1:17:16] so they took all the jars filled them
[1:17:18] all up amen and then when the last one
[1:17:20] was um full the oil stopped flowing
[1:17:24] Hallelujah and then she went to the went
[1:17:26] to the prophet no doubt rejoicing could
[1:17:28] could you imagine the
[1:17:30] feeling is this going to work well he
[1:17:32] told me it's going to work you know so I
[1:17:34] believe it's going to work but then when
[1:17:36] Faith becomes sight I mean when when the
[1:17:38] first jar is full and the second jar is
[1:17:41] full and the third jar is full and maybe
[1:17:42] your arm was getting a bit sore so now
[1:17:44] swaps over and then every Jar full full
[1:17:46] full full but yet she's holding this
[1:17:48] little you know our faith is far greater
[1:17:51] than we know she had to to do that in
[1:17:53] faith amen she had to take the word of
[1:17:55] the prophet in faith and apply it amen
[1:17:58] so that's what she did and then she went
[1:18:00] to the man of God and said and he said
[1:18:02] go sell the oil pay your debts and you
[1:18:05] and your sons can live on the rest see
[1:18:08] so now this Redemption see this
[1:18:10] Redemption what it purches it gives us
[1:18:11] the ability to live off it what do we
[1:18:14] live off joy peace love Comfort when the
[1:18:19] Devil comes and with troubled well in
[1:18:21] this Redemption is comfort you don't
[1:18:23] know which way to turn well in this
[1:18:25] Redemption is guidance he's our Shepherd
[1:18:27] amen sickness comes in well in this
[1:18:29] Redemption is healing Amen in this
[1:18:32] Redemption is salvation for our families
[1:18:33] it's all we can live off these things
[1:18:36] amen all of our days amen that because
[1:18:38] the beautiful thing about Redemption is
[1:18:40] once we have re been redeemed we don't
[1:18:43] go back
[1:18:44] to what caused us to go into into
[1:18:47] slavery again because the thing is with
[1:18:50] this Redemption it's not just a
[1:18:51] forgiveness of a debt you know because
[1:18:53] it's like a man I think I heard brother
[1:18:55] Tim PR say this I thought it was a very
[1:18:56] good analogy where he said it's like a
[1:18:58] man see just say if I was in a big mess
[1:19:00] of financial debt and then a and then a
[1:19:03] wise businessman came along and said I
[1:19:05] can pay your debt off and I'd be very
[1:19:07] happy about that I'd be I'd be rejoicing
[1:19:09] because my debts you know but yet Within
[1:19:11] Me is still a nature that I can fall
[1:19:13] into debt again but then now what if the
[1:19:15] spirit of that wise
[1:19:17] businessman didn't so so he didn't just
[1:19:19] pay off my debt but it now came into me
[1:19:21] that now my thinking everything changed
[1:19:23] that I could not fall into that dead
[1:19:25] again because I've be made a different
[1:19:27] person right and that's exactly what
[1:19:28] happens when the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:19:30] US amen we're no longer that deta that's
[1:19:33] just being forgiven no the wise master
[1:19:35] builder the Lord Jesus Christ now steps
[1:19:37] in that we can't fall back into sin debt
[1:19:40] anymore praise the Lord so it's not just
[1:19:42] it's not just forgiven amen we are
[1:19:45] changed amen but this oil that we've
[1:19:48] been given this Redemption we've been
[1:19:50] given we can live off it now don't use
[1:19:52] it sparing
[1:19:53] Hallelujah don't use the promises of God
[1:19:55] sparingly amen it's an inexhaustible
[1:19:58] Fountain amen this is not a diet amen no
[1:20:01] this is a this is a gastronomical
[1:20:03] jubilee of goodness amen you say well I
[1:20:05] better just read the Bible sparingly
[1:20:07] because I'm going to run out no this
[1:20:08] word's Eternal am mean you can read the
[1:20:10] same scripture for every day for the
[1:20:11] rest of your life and something else
[1:20:13] will become greater in it am me because
[1:20:15] that word is eternal amen it never runs
[1:20:17] out amen it's like the hidden manner
[1:20:20] amen that was that was that was under
[1:20:22] the mercy SE in the Ark of the Covenant
[1:20:24] that manner never went stale it never
[1:20:26] got Roden amen it's the same thing when
[1:20:28] the Holy Ghost comes into your soul the
[1:20:29] word comes into your soul it never gets
[1:20:32] old it never becomes common I mean when
[1:20:35] you're redeemed in completeness and in
[1:20:36] Joy it never becomes common that you
[1:20:38] were once lost now you're found amen you
[1:20:40] never take it for granted that you're a
[1:20:42] son of or daughter of the king amen it
[1:20:45] is it never spoils amen it never gets
[1:20:47] boring it never becomes common it's
[1:20:49] Finger Licking Good Honey in the Rock
[1:20:52] that's what it is amen it's satisfying
[1:20:54] to any thirsty
[1:20:56] Soul Hallelujah now when Jesus said it's
[1:20:58] finished it's because all of Jesus's
[1:21:00] Works was complete everything was
[1:21:02] complete total delivered he totally
[1:21:04] delivered the leper from leprosy he
[1:21:06] totally delivered the woman with the
[1:21:08] blood issue from her issue he totally
[1:21:10] delivered the world from sin when he
[1:21:12] died at the day of the atonement he
[1:21:14] totally delivered every sin he delivered
[1:21:16] the church there's no need for us to
[1:21:18] live under privileged people there's no
[1:21:20] need for us to live in a defeated State
[1:21:22] because because he defeated the devil
[1:21:23] and took all the principalities and
[1:21:25] powers and subdued them under his feet
[1:21:28] and they have no legal rights to rule
[1:21:30] over you we are Christians who's a
[1:21:32] Christian today amen filled with the
[1:21:34] Holy Ghost we don't have to have the
[1:21:36] devil dictate to us Christ delivered us
[1:21:38] total Deliverance delivered us from evil
[1:21:41] delivered us from sin delivered us from
[1:21:43] the from Habits delivering us from
[1:21:45] Talking delivered us from the um um from
[1:21:48] black God Deliver Us from all kinds of
[1:21:49] smudy things he totally delivered us and
[1:21:52] puts us in his holy hands a complete
[1:21:54] total Deliverance he delivered our
[1:21:57] sickness he delivered us from sickness
[1:21:59] for we have an abstract deed to that
[1:22:01] Hallelujah for he was wounded for our
[1:22:03] transgressions with the stripes we were
[1:22:05] healed he is our healer that's why that
[1:22:07] poor little poo woman trying to take
[1:22:09] care of a cancer dying husband she
[1:22:11] walked into the Realms of the prince of
[1:22:13] God she had faith and the doctors had
[1:22:15] done all they could do so she followed
[1:22:17] God's instructions and was totally
[1:22:20] delivered amen so this so so this is a
[1:22:22] total Deliverance so we're redeemed in
[1:22:25] completeness now I'm getting to the Joy
[1:22:27] bit amen amen to the definition of Joy
[1:22:29] it's a gladness it's the joy received
[1:22:31] from you it's the cause or occasion of
[1:22:34] Joy amen it's a person who are one's Joy
[1:22:38] amen so there's a great cause or
[1:22:40] occasion of Joy what is that we are
[1:22:42] redeemed in completeness amen we have a
[1:22:44] great occasion to be joyful that's right
[1:22:46] I mean as that as that scripture in 1
[1:22:48] Peter 18 the uh ESV version it says
[1:22:52] though you you have not seen him you
[1:22:53] love him though you do not see um though
[1:22:55] you do not now see him you believe in
[1:22:57] him and rejoice with joy that is inex
[1:23:00] expressable and filled with Glory why
[1:23:03] because it's such a great joy I mean you
[1:23:05] can't really put words to describe the
[1:23:07] reality of being redeemed or being
[1:23:10] washed in the blood or being transformed
[1:23:11] by the Holy Ghost you can't quite put it
[1:23:13] into words but you try I mean you try
[1:23:16] and put it into words amen but you just
[1:23:18] can't quite get it there amen of Lord
[1:23:20] why because it's such a because it's not
[1:23:22] a mental thing that you can teach only
[1:23:25] but it's got to be a reality that comes
[1:23:27] into our lives like you see like the you
[1:23:30] know the children of Israel they under
[1:23:31] the blood of bulls and goats they left
[1:23:33] Egypt you know but then there was the
[1:23:35] cry you know they heard the chariot
[1:23:37] wheels and things behind them and all
[1:23:39] the fear of all their task Masters and
[1:23:41] the and the trauma and the pain that
[1:23:42] they they experienced in Egypt as slav
[1:23:45] started to flood back into their minds
[1:23:47] and they began to panic there by the Red
[1:23:49] Sea and they said to Moses did you not
[1:23:51] bring us you just brought us out here to
[1:23:52] die wouldn't there b graves in Egypt why
[1:23:54] have you brought us this way but God had
[1:23:56] delivered them by Blood and by power now
[1:23:59] he is going to completely show his power
[1:24:02] of redemption amen and give them such a
[1:24:04] Redemption of completeness and en Joy
[1:24:06] because he wanted to them to completely
[1:24:08] know they had been redeemed he wanted to
[1:24:11] completely show them that they were
[1:24:13] redeemed that they didn't just Escape
[1:24:15] Egypt and they could have been overcome
[1:24:17] by what they brought out of God wanted
[1:24:18] to show them that that that their task
[1:24:21] Masters those that beat them as slaves
[1:24:23] and killed their children and did
[1:24:25] horrible things to them we're going to
[1:24:26] be no more that's why Moses before the
[1:24:29] sea ever opened God spoke through him
[1:24:31] and said these Egyptians you see today
[1:24:33] you shall see them no more forever
[1:24:35] there's going to be a change in your
[1:24:36] life from this moment on this enemy
[1:24:38] that's been def defeating you and
[1:24:40] tearing you down is going to be drowned
[1:24:42] Amen in the Red Sea amen so then Moses
[1:24:44] lifted up his staff and he parted the
[1:24:46] waters and then Israel walked on on dry
[1:24:48] land and then they came when they all
[1:24:50] safely across the sea the Egyptians
[1:24:53] thought that they could cross as well
[1:24:54] but then they got drowned in the Red Sea
[1:24:57] what a feeling it must have been I mean
[1:24:59] when they saw their task Masters drowned
[1:25:01] those ones that beat them maybe they saw
[1:25:03] the exact ones that were beating them
[1:25:04] was now face down in the Red Sea what a
[1:25:06] feeling that would have been to realize
[1:25:08] Jehovah God has redeemed Us in
[1:25:10] completeness amen from Egypt complete

[1:25:22] did terrible things were now dead and
[1:25:25] could torment them no more amen that's

[1:25:33] tambourine she got anointed by what she
[1:25:35] saw I mean she got anointed by the fact
[1:25:37] that she had been redeemed and
[1:25:38] completeness and she started to dance
[1:25:40] amen and bang the tambourine on the
[1:25:41] Shore Bank amen and then all the other
[1:25:43] women of Israel begin to dance and
[1:25:45] rejoice with it God in the spirit of the
[1:25:46] meeting I mean brother MCS talk about a
[1:25:49] Pentecostal meeting am mean when they
[1:25:51] look now Hallelujah see our religion we
[1:25:54] have is old it's not new this is an old
[1:25:57] religion this is an oldtime religion
[1:25:59] actually started before the foundation
[1:26:00] of the world and job was asked by God
[1:26:03] where were you when the sons of God
[1:26:04] praised amen hallelujah why so so what a
[1:26:08] what an atmosphere that would have been
[1:26:10] in because they looked at the Red Sea
[1:26:12] and they saw their enemies were drowned
[1:26:14] I mean no wonder Moses got in the spirit
[1:26:16] begin to sing the songs of Moses am amen
[1:26:18] praise God for all that he had done yes
[1:26:20] sir amen now listen friends that was
[1:26:22] just a physical enemy was drowned in a
[1:26:25] physical sea I mean now how much more
[1:26:27] see they were just they were delivered
[1:26:29] from a physical bondage they redeemed
[1:26:32] from a physical enemy that was a great
[1:26:35] day but tell you friends thousands of
[1:26:38] years after that amen when our Lord
[1:26:39] Jesus Christ bowed his head and died
[1:26:41] amen and he redeemed Adam's Fallen race
[1:26:44] amen not just from a not from a physical
[1:26:46] oppression but a spiritual oppression
[1:26:48] from a sin nature that they were born
[1:26:50] with that they could not free themselves
[1:26:51] from amen what a day that is when you
[1:26:53] can look into the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] and you can see your enemies dead amen
[1:26:58] you can see that family Spirit dead you
[1:26:59] can see that tormenting Spirit dead amen
[1:27:02] what a joy that that gives us amen we
[1:27:05] can see our enemy is dead amen sometimes
[1:27:08] we need to go back and look in that red
[1:27:10] sea of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:27:12] realize what he has taken from us Glory
[1:27:16] hallelujah amen it was a complete see
[1:27:19] it's a complete Redemption and complete
[1:27:22] and in Joy amen God's joy is not based
[1:27:26] on a true Joy is not based on
[1:27:27] circumstances right amen when when Paul
[1:27:31] would would meet the Lord on the road to
[1:27:33] Damascus and God transformed his life he
[1:27:37] realized that he was truly redeemed sin
[1:27:39] nature didn't rule him religion didn't
[1:27:42] rule him his culture didn't rule him I
[1:27:44] mean he wasn't under the slavery of
[1:27:46] those things no more but he was a l
[1:27:48] prisoner to Jesus christall amen that's
[1:27:51] why he could look at that chopping block
[1:27:52] and say death R is your thing grave
[1:27:54] where is your Victory
[1:27:57] amen hallelujah hallelujah see the joy
[1:28:00] that Israel experienced was nothing
[1:28:02] compared to the 120 on the day of
[1:28:04] Pentecost I mean where God had gather
[1:28:06] them to show the full power of his blood
[1:28:08] amen that was far greater than the blood
[1:28:10] of bulls and goats that just covered sin
[1:28:12] and took sin uh but but it took sin and
[1:28:15] sin nature out of the people I mean
[1:28:17] that's why you know when we can we can
[1:28:19] look at Calvary and see what Our
[1:28:20] Redeemer has done for for us Amen in its
[1:28:23] completeness how can you not have joy
[1:28:26] how can it not make you happy Hallelujah
[1:28:29] the Lord praise the Lord amen that's why
[1:28:31] they staggered like drunk people there
[1:28:33] after the Holy Ghost filled them they
[1:28:34] were jabbering and speaking in other
[1:28:37] languages staggering around like drunk
[1:28:38] people amen they were they were carrying
[1:28:40] on that seemed very indifi but what had
[1:28:43] happened they realized they had been
[1:28:45] redeemed and completeness and en Joy
[1:28:47] amen The Joy was springing up because
[1:28:49] they realized that the blood that they
[1:28:51] saw come out of their Lord's body amen
[1:28:54] the life that was in the blood now came
[1:28:55] in them amen and they were now
[1:28:57] completely sealed to the day of their
[1:29:00] Redemption see this is why it's such a
[1:29:01] complete a complete Redemption why
[1:29:04] because when you're sealed by the Holy
[1:29:05] Ghost you're sealed into the day of your
[1:29:06] Redemption the devil can't burn it out
[1:29:08] of you he can't he can't argue it out of
[1:29:11] you he can't take the holy ghost out of
[1:29:13] you you are safe as safe can be sure you
[1:29:15] go through trouble you go through
[1:29:16] hardship but the devil can't take those
[1:29:18] things out of you and I that's right am
[1:29:20] mean he cannot take the baptism of the
[1:29:22] Holy Ghost from you and I amen it
[1:29:24] quickened their bodies it quickened
[1:29:25] their souls they scream they dance amen
[1:29:27] even even even Mary you know jesus'
[1:29:31] mother there you know she she had to
[1:29:33] climb up there into the upper room
[1:29:34] receive the Holy Ghost and act like a b
[1:29:37] just like a drunk woman Amen to get into
[1:29:38] heaven Hallelujah but why why did they
[1:29:41] do that because the stimulation was so
[1:29:43] great The Joy was so great it was more
[1:29:46] than just a human Joy amen but it was
[1:29:49] God's Own Joy cuz remember we started
[1:29:51] off with the script where the where the
[1:29:53] shepherd is rejoicing you keep reading
[1:29:56] and there's a woman that loses one of
[1:29:57] her coins she rejoices when she finds
[1:29:59] the coin amen there's the story of the
[1:30:01] prodical son amen this the father
[1:30:03] rejoices when the son comes home amen so
[1:30:06] it's not just our joy that we're
[1:30:07] redeemed but God has a joy amen amen I'm
[1:30:09] going to finish with this thought amen
[1:30:11] it says now if you abide in me and my
[1:30:13] words abide in you you you shall ask
[1:30:15] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:30:18] you herein is my father glorified that
[1:30:20] you bear much fruit so shall you be my
[1:30:23] disciples as the father has loved me so
[1:30:25] have I loved you continue ye in my love
[1:30:29] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[1:30:30] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[1:30:32] father's Commandments and abide in his
[1:30:35] love these things I have spoken unto you
[1:30:37] that my joy might REM might remain in
[1:30:41] you and that your joy might be full see
[1:30:46] there's a moment we can go back where we
[1:30:47] know the Lord got a hold of our lives
[1:30:50] and it gave us great joy
[1:30:52] and and we think how can we stay in that
[1:30:54] kind of a joy wouldn't it be nice to
[1:30:56] stay in that all the time well you can
[1:30:58] amen because because the Lord wants his
[1:31:01] joy to remain in you amen amen that your
[1:31:04] joy might be full so he wants our joy to
[1:31:07] be full he wants us to be happy
[1:31:08] Christians amen he doesn't want us to be
[1:31:10] sad sad and downcast and down he wants
[1:31:12] us to be happy amen and he wants us to
[1:31:15] be happy in every situation even though
[1:31:18] it's hard there may be great trouble
[1:31:19] going on but he still wants us to have
[1:31:21] joy Joy now this is the great secret he
[1:31:24] says this is my commandment that you
[1:31:26] love one another as I loved you so if
[1:31:29] you want his joy to remain in you love
[1:31:32] one another as he has loved you amen
[1:31:34] amen don't hold any grudges bitterness
[1:31:36] resentment ill feelings just get those
[1:31:38] things out of the way and because you'll
[1:31:40] find as soon as those things come in Joy
[1:31:43] goes out you can't you know because when
[1:31:45] there's joy there when you're when
[1:31:47] you're Punch Drunk on the Holy Ghost you

[1:31:55] in the bank they can have all kind of
[1:31:56] trouble but they're happy why cuz
[1:31:59] they're drunk just and now this is just
[1:32:00] a natural drunk now you take a a a a
[1:32:03] holy ghost drunk who's ever been drunk

[1:32:19] hallelujah so we got to stay in the love
[1:32:23] of God don't let any ought come in if
[1:32:26] you can't Overlook someone's mistake I
[1:32:29] say you got to come back to a love where
[1:32:31] you can Overlook those things where
[1:32:33] actually everything is okay amen there's
[1:32:36] no bad feelings no trouble no I mean
[1:32:38] there'll be trouble sure because we're
[1:32:39] human but there should be no ill
[1:32:40] feelings you know we should never ever
[1:32:43] hold something against someone we should
[1:32:45] always give people the benefit of the
[1:32:47] doubt amen if we want the love of God
[1:32:50] God's love I mean Joy well his his love
[1:32:52] is but his his joy to remain in US amen
[1:32:55] CU he wants our joy to be full so we
[1:32:57] can't we must love see see he loved us
[1:33:00] with a redeeming love remember the Bible
[1:33:03] says when we were his enemy he died for
[1:33:04] us we were we weren't his neutal we were
[1:33:07] neutral we were his enemy once upon a
[1:33:10] time but yet he loved us anyway amen
[1:33:13] amen when we were lost in darkness he
[1:33:15] came looking for you and I so should
[1:33:18] should we not have that s same kind of
[1:33:20] sacrificial love who wants a full
[1:33:23] Joy remember because if you are redeemed
[1:33:25] in completeness you will have joy
[1:33:28] there'll be a manifestation if you're
[1:33:29] not happy in your religion you say Lord
[1:33:32] created me a Clean Heart Lord renew a
[1:33:34] right Spirit Within Me David said
[1:33:36] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:33:39] am mean so he didn't lose his salvation
[1:33:41] but he lost the joy of it that's what
[1:33:43] the devil wants us to do he wants to Rob
[1:33:45] our joy of being saved amen the joy of
[1:33:48] our Redemption the devil wants to take
[1:33:50] that from us amen but you
[1:33:52] see we can stay in that
[1:33:55] Joy amen this is not a thing where we
[1:33:58] just enjoy God for a little bit we
[1:34:00] fizzle out we just occupy a Pew no This
[1:34:03] Joy should be greater amen amen the more
[1:34:05] we walk with God the greater reality of
[1:34:07] what he brought us out of should become
[1:34:09] apparent I mean the greater power the
[1:34:12] full power of the blood should become
[1:34:13] more apparent what he's done for us you
[1:34:15] think about it if we all left right now
[1:34:18] and we're in heaven I think we'll really
[1:34:21] realiz what he's done the things he's
[1:34:23] kept us from the things he saved us from
[1:34:25] the things he's delivered us from the
[1:34:26] things that we walked in both eyes open
[1:34:29] he took us out of Amen his love that's
[1:34:31] kept us he's guided us Comfort Us in
[1:34:33] great times of trouble if we could
[1:34:35] really see you know like that sheep
[1:34:37] that's just lost we read about the
[1:34:39] opening scripture just wandered off the
[1:34:40] path looking for some grass somewhere
[1:34:43] not knowing where it's going it doesn't
[1:34:44] know but now the shepherd's going to
[1:34:46] climb up Mountains go through valleys
[1:34:48] maybe Wade through water you know maybe
[1:34:50] get injured hurt hung hungry you know
[1:34:52] the Sheep doesn't know what the shepherd
[1:34:54] had had to go through to get it right
[1:34:57] it's just like really we can read about
[1:34:59] Jesus being mared more than any man you
[1:35:01] know his bone you know you know bones
[1:35:03] out of joint and all those things but we
[1:35:04] don't know what he had to go through and
[1:35:07] because we just look at the physical
[1:35:08] things what about carrying the sin of
[1:35:10] the world upon their shoulders we all
[1:35:12] you know I'm sure we all knew that day
[1:35:14] when we really felt that burden of sin
[1:35:16] on our shoulders and we all know that
[1:35:17] day when we laid it at the cross and it
[1:35:19] was gone right so
[1:35:22] we don't know really what the Sheep's
[1:35:23] really gone through and its full
[1:35:25] magnitude but you see when he found the
[1:35:27] Sheep he just laid on his shoulders and
[1:35:28] rejoiced amen he didn't say you stupid
[1:35:31] sheep you shouldn't have done this no
[1:35:32] he's happy amen that sheep that's mine
[1:35:34] has come back and he wants that same joy
[1:35:37] to be transferred into US amen that that
[1:35:40] that how that that how he looks at
[1:35:43] Redemption we would look at it the same
[1:35:45] way amen so friends love one
[1:35:48] another if you want your joy to be full
[1:35:51] love one another be quick to forgive be
