then we're going to go to um we're going to go to uh well i've got a bit of reading so we don't want to do too much reading standing up so we're going to go to exodus 28 first we'll just read this so you can have the comfort of your seats exodus 28 i'm going to read from verse 15 down to verse 29 live on there amen yep and thou shall make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the ephod shall thou make it of gold of blue and of purple of scarlet and a fine twine linen shall thou make it four square shallow um shall it foursquare it shall be being double the span shall be the length thereof and a span shall be the breadth thereof and even shall thou see it uh sit in its settings of stones even four rows of stones the first row being a sardis a topaz a carbuncle this shall be the first row and the second row shall be an emerald a sapphire and a diamond and the third row uh legue however you pronounce that and and agat something and an amethyst and the fourth row of beryl and oxen of jasper they shall be set in gold in their enclosings and the stones shall be with the names of the children of israel twelve according to their names like the engravings of a signet every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes and thou shall make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of the wreath and work of pure gold and thou shall make upon the breastplate two rings of gold and shall put the two rings on the on the two ends of the breastplate and thou shall put the two reason chains of gold in the two rings which are put on the ends of the breastplate and the other two ends of the two wreathen change shall thou fasten in the two ounces and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod before it and thou shall make two rings of gold and thou shall put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof which is in the side of the ephod inward and the two other rings of gold shall thou make and shall put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath toward the full part thereof over against the other coupling thereof above the curious girdle of the ephod and thou shall bind the breastplate by the

the children of israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart when he goeth in unto the holy place that's the holy of holies for a memorial before the law continually and thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the human thundem and they shall be upon aaron's heart when he goeth in before the lord and aaron shall be the judgment of the children of israel upon his heart before the lord continually amen may the lord bless his word tonight you may have your seats we're also going to read from from revelations 5 a good a good portion of it as well i want to talk about the working of the high priest just just just one aspect of it and um i just pray the lord would you know something that brother adrian said at camp which really blessed me so i just want to go into it maybe uh just a bit more but um we read here in in revelations 5 and 1 we're just going to read down to verse 10 probably i trust a familiar piece of scripture to us all and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon says the title deed to the earth but also represents you and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders sat unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb every one of them having harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayer of saints and they sung a new song saying they are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and people a tongan people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth amen so we read here in in uh exodus chapter 28 where where where the we're the high priest because we know that the high priest function was essential in the worship in israel where even though they they would bring their sin offerings and they would do various offerings through the year but the high priest once a year with blood went into the holy of holies on behalf of the people to atone for their sins and it was only the high priest that could do it but notice now that you're the high priest he didn't just go in uh you know he was you know you know just for himself only but but he was carrying the names of the people upon his heart and so now you know what i love about this is is you know to me it's showing that you know our lord jesus christ when he was on the cross we're on his mind we're on his heart and he went into the he you know he ascended up into glory with us on his heart i mean so so he atoned for our sins with us on his heart you know it wasn't just a business transaction just something just going through the motions but there are people to be redeemed that are on his heart and that's why he did what he did so the high priest went in with the names of the people of israel the tribes on his heart and he went and he offered the blood and when he came out then the people were accepted because the offering was accepted and if you're if you're of the tribe of of reuben or gad or you know all of the tribes if you were part of that tribe i mean your sins were washed away because the high priest his offering was accepted because he is carrying your name when he went to the presence of god and it's the same thing with you and i amen remember our our names in the lamb's book of life hallelujah and so he went into glory with his own blood with our names on his heart to atone for your knight and what i love about this atonement is that once a year was done and and and what was tied in with this once a year offering that the high priest did was also was a year of jubilee so now the high priest went in he offered the blood he came out then there's a blowing of trump it's a jubilee trumpet and so if your name was on the high priest's heart when he went in then if you heard that jubilee trumpet you had a you had a choice to walk free or to stay bound i mean so it was a time of release where every man would go back to his possession so what he fell from he had a right to go back and possess what he fell from now we are the sons and daughters the most high god you know we are the children of adam if you can trace it back spiritually who is the son of god now and now the prophet tells us that everything adam lost we have received i mean so now we have heard a jubilee trumpet in this hour where we can return back to our possession which is what eternal life godship over the earth amen you know nature i mean i mean dominion over satan and all of hell and thing we can return back to eternal life hallelujah that everything adam lost now we can receive hallelujah so you know i know it's a bit of a bit of a reading in exodus but i just wanted you to see that he went in with the people's names on us over his heart not just on his chest with his over his heart hallelujah and because the blood was offered it was accepted i meant the people were accepted now this this scene that we read here in in revelations 5 brother braham says that the lamb taking the book it's the most sublime piece of scripture it's one of the mo it is the most sublime act in all of scripture where where what what our lord jesus purchased at down calvary now he comes to claim it hallelujah because john looked around you know he you know if we if we go back you know we can look in revelations 1 how it says that he was in the spirit on the lord's day and we know this is not the lord's day this is man's day right so he is actually transported into the future in the spirit and uh we know also the day of the lord is not saturday a sabbath amen because the sabbath is just a shadow speaking of a eternal rest amen it's not you know the lord so so john wasn't in the spirit on a saturday or a sabbath right he was on the spirit in the lord's day so he was taken forward in time up until eternity and god was going to show john god's plan of redemption hollywood what has this got to do with us if we can see our god's plan and us in god's plan it should give us such a faith that if we made it over there if we came from god we're going to go back to god and whatever the devil does in time it doesn't matter too much really because we're going to overcome him and in reality we have already overcome him hallelujah so as i said he he wasn't there on a saturday he was in the lord's day now paul would say in in colossians 2 he says let no man therefore this is colossians 2 and 16 let no man therefore judge you and meet her and drink a respective and holy day or the new moon or the or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ so he's saying even the sabbath keeping the sabbath was just a shadow but now we have a reality because we know that the sabbath day is when the lord rested from his works right and god god held it as a holy day that man should rest from his works and keep that day doing no work now that was just pointing to the reality is when a believer really receives the holy ghost they cease from their own works and they enter into rest amen you know if you read hebrews 3 and 4 the apostle paul talks about it so when god comes and takes over your life you cease from your own works it's not you trying to be the christian it's him being the christian in you hallelujah so it's now him taking over and working through us hallelujah amen so john we know uh in the book of revelation as a symbol himself now i've probably covered these things but you know maybe i'm just getting old apparently i'm in my late 30s so you know i repeat myself but these things are very essential because it's more than just learning a teaching but you know john himself is a symbol in the book brother brown would tell us in revelations chapter 4 this is in 1960 notice john being taken up immediately after the church age was a type of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over this ladies and church age then comes the rapture the church goes up like john did into the presence of god he says that just winds my soul around caught up at the rapture of the church i mean so he's saying that at the end of the seventh church age there's a translation of the living and the dead saints hallelujah so john is a symbol in the book and that's why you can take the prophet's ministry and you can take what the angel came and saw john as he brother and preached on it here's the future home this is what ends up with the devil yeah i saw this and saw this and you know you know you can actually see what the angel showed show john is what the prophet preaching showed us because john is a symbol of the bride amen and so we are in the book of revelation hallelujah that's why you know even the book yo it is it is the bride's book it's the bride's portion hallelujah so it's a very important book it was in symbol but now it's no longer a mystery anymore it's been revealed amen so it doesn't matter what people argue about well this symbol means this this means this means we've had a vindicated prophet unless this day tell us what it means i mean so just like i said on sunday the umpire himself has come on the scene and said this is what it is hallelujah because it because brotherham said it wasn't me as god himself hallelujah and you know any ministry that says now if i've said the truth let him come and back it up what i've said is truth and god comes down in a unique scriptural way and vindicates it i'd say well i'll take that i think i think that's a good one to listen to i mean so so john has taken it so he's assembled himself in the book and he's lifted up into the eternities and then he's now looking around to see now who can actually take this title deed back that adam lost now there has been one in the eternities there that's been our high priest where where um jesus would tell mary on the morning of the resurrection where where she went to the tomb and she looks around and you know she's all downcast and broken and you know and then she turns around she sees a young man maybe looking about 18 to 21 years old you know and you know she thinks that he's the gardener but then he's he says one word to her changes her whole life calls her by name mary her eyes come open rabona you know messiah it's you and then but then she is told by him you know don't touch me because i've not ascended yet so he had to go up into the holy s into heaven itself i mean to be received right amen but he says go tell my disciples that i sent to my god and your god my father and your father hallelujah so so he had to go up there right then he came back down we know and then he said to thomas you know touch that put your hand in my side touch me you know verify me by contact and then and then thomas had the revelation that i wish the church world had he said my lord and my god wasn't a second person of trinity he was god hallelujah i mean so and then he ascended on high and the physical body of jesus christ is at the right hand of the majesty on high and we so so we do not now he is not a dead form he's ever living to make intercession for us amen he's ever living making intercession for us amen and he is his spirit is down upon the earth working out things for us to leave now what i love about it is is we can take this and you know it was on my heart quite a lot to go look in the life of joseph we know joseph parallels you know the you know as a as a type of jesus christ real perfectly amen hallelujah so so if you look at his life you know he was he was a spiritual spiritual man had dreams interpreted them his natural brethren hated him and they hated him without a cause just like the jews hated jesus you know he was sold for about 30 pieces of silver just like jesus was amen but then you know and then and then when he was in prison the second time you know the butler was um now i always get things mixed up normally the baker was killed you know and they and they and the butler wasn't just like you know one thief was pardoned received eternal life on the cross the other one went to hell you know was rejected you know died you know but then he by then after he was ascended to the right hand of god jesus was joseph was ascended to the right hand of pharaoh amen you know he had a covenant uh you know joseph had a covenant you know coat of many colors just like our lord jesus has a covenant right i mean so but then but then in that time he takes a gentile bride after the rejection by his brethren and him being down in egypt he takes a gentile bride but then during this time of trouble because there's a great famine it was a couple of years into this famine that that that that he finally revealed himself to his brother you know you know to to his brethren it says in june um uh genesis 45 and one then joseph could not refrain himself but for all of them that stood by him and he cried caused every man to go out from me and stood there with no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud in the egyptians in the house of pharaoh heard so where is his wife in the palace so because remember when when the lord had had some names on his heart in the land's book of life it's not just a gentile bride there's the jews there as well the 144 000 there's the elected ones they're on his heart too so now there has to be blood for them as well right so now he so so he he reveals himself to a gentile bride hello gentile bride how are you i remember when he goes to reveal himself to his jewish brethren we're up in the palace right so rapture takes place we're up in the palace and he comes back down and they ask him where'd you get those wounds in the house of my friends as the scriptures in their well like uh you know family apart everything like a you know for only uh yeah you know for a son that's being lost in song because they realize that they crucified the very god that they were looking for i mean but it was in a time of trouble that this happened you know it was a time of famine and that famine did not just grip egypt but it gripped the whole world around it you know that's why that's why the you know um his brothers came from canaan down into egypt because there's a famine there also so there's a time of trouble upon the earth but there's a there's a gathering in this time of trouble now we're facing big trouble upon the earth nature's broken the scripture says that creation travails until the manifestation of the sons of god so it's not a surprise that nature's falling apart i mean we're you know the whole world is facing nuclear war right there's been a lot of wars and rumors of wars before but this is a time where the whole world can annihilate itself right there's you know there's economic collapse on the horizon country's collapsing nature's collapsing so it's a time of trouble right but in this time of trouble there's a gathering hallelujah amen because joseph had some names on his heart hallelujah and then so he said so so all of the house of pharaoh hurt and then verse 3 of 45 and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph does my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you they came there he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for there for these two years had the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be earring nor harvest amen brother ram says and we would see jesus david was anointed with the spirit of god the prophets was anointed with the spirit of god that was christ and joseph that made him portray christ exactly sold for about 30 pieces of silver loved by the father hated by the brethren in his prison in this prison house like christ was on the cross one was saved uh and the baker and the butler and one was saved the other one was lost the same thing said at the right hand of pharaoh and every time he went forth the trumpet sounded everyone bow the knee joseph is coming and no man could get to pharaoh only through joseph that was christ in joseph i mean it's all down through that time of trouble there but he got a gentile bride hallelujah amen so now and he says this he says and here we find the jews under persecution didn't know where they stand now but they're coming back speaking of going back to the homeland and when and when they do see the atonement appear the bible said when they seen it they said they would separate one home from another and weep for days like a family that's lost their only son where did you get those wounds he said in the house of my friend see remember the bride is already in heaven joseph's wife was in the palace and joseph dismissed everything from around him and made himself known to his brothers you see his wife and children and them that was in the palace when he returns back to make himself known to the jews there is the atonement there is your sound trumpet there is where they say oh what is it there's the atonement where where's them wounds come from there it is in the house of my friends remember what joseph's brothers said why they said now we're all be killed sure enough we did that we did that evil like that he said no god did this to save life you remember the story in genesis c so did he so he did it this way to save life uh to save the life of the gentiles the bride said i've got them in the house of my friend don't be angry see don't be afraid of yourself they say oh my did we actually miss seeing him was that the atonement and we missed it oh god they said they just separate themselves and mourn for days what is it the atonement sadness this time the coming of the making known atonement is not the regular atonement being killed like in leviticus 16 but leviticus 23 is a mourning time of their sins and their sins was they rejected it amen so there is a so during this time now there is a gathering of a people now i trust this is not news to you you know because we're kind of living out this gathering of a people hallelujah amen because it's got to be manifested upon the earth so so john was taken up and then brother braham says it's the most sublime act in the scripture is when the lamb takes the book he says notice he is not an animal this is what we just read in your revelations five it's all symbolic remember he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand phew what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne what is it now belongs to the lamb amen god's law required it he's the one that holds it god's law requires a kinsmen redeemer i mean that's why he he god became man amen to redeem us back to god amen here to be born to be one of us i mean to take the sins of the world upon himself and the lamb came out holding it i'm their kinsmen i am their redeemer i mean i have made intercession for them now i've come to claim their rights for them amen there's the only one i've come to claim their rights and that they have a right to everything that was lost in the fall i've paid the price so he says now i have come to i mean i've come to claim their rights for them others it's not us claiming our own rights it's actually god coming to claim your rights it means if our rights are overcoming power he says i've come to make claims for that amen healing of the sick whatever it may be deliverance or peace of mind joy whatever it may be amen our rights in the in the holy ghost says i have come to claim their rights for them hallelujah amy says now notice requires the kinsmen redeemer and the redeemer kinsmen redeemer must be born of the human race there that leaves us out on a limb you think about it because who could be born into the human race worthy to take the book because we're all born in sin we're all we're all trapped to begin with how can we how can we ever do it we can't produce it i mean in our own ability that's why it leaves us out on a limb but let me sound the trumpet to you the virgin birth produced the product amen the virgin birth produced our kinsmen redeemer none other but the almighty god became emmanuel one of us emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met you see how god makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do who's ever who's ever come to that conclusion he says be perfect as my father in heaven is perfect that's a requirement oh boy that puts us out on a limb how can i be perfect i know how i think i know my family is my whatever i think my success is doesn't amount to hillary beans right you know but you know because our own righteousness is but filthy rags in his sight right but you know so so this puts us out on a limb be perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect so we can't do it ourselves the only way is for god to send a perfect sacrifice and for us to receive that sacrifice receive that perfection of the sacrifice and then because the sacrifice is accepted and it's perfect then we become perfect through our sacrifice hallelujah amen there's nothing we can do but then grace steps in and overshadows the law and produces the product amen and hallelujah oh when you get over home when i get my little cabin down there that brother neville sings about when you hear something down there one morning amazing grace how sweet the sound that save the wretch like me you say oh brother brown made it there he is see oh my it's grace it taught my heart to fear it was grace my fears relieved how precious did that grace appear the hour i first believed wait till we get down to it oh in a moment oh my the book now when he speaks about the taking of the book this is why it becomes a personal thing he says the book of ruth gives a beautiful picture of this so it goes from just so it's not actually a book this is it too because this was sealed with seven seals right but it he actually takes from just a book of ink on paper to a person he's saying the book of ruth gives a beautiful picture of this what is the lamb taking the book he says hell no how boaz he says he says know me had lost the estate uh you know you heard me preaching i haven't you raise up your hands if you heard me preacher you understand see boaz had to become a redeemer so so ruth i mean i mean so naomi we know they left israel they went to moab you know naomi's um husband died two sons died and but but before the sons died one of them married um ruth and then and then after they just widows nomi hears that there's now grain again in israel and she says i'm just gonna go back home and ruth made the decision no me will you die i die where you go i go your god be my god i'm following you and they just happen to find themselves in a place where there is a near kinsman that could actually fix this whole mess that they found their lives in halia so now here we were we were born in this mess amen that's a mess it was a dog's breakfast to say the least you know it was a big mess but we needed someone to come and fix this great big mess hallelujah so so so ruth who is a moabitess the law says that moabites can't even come into the congregation of israel remember grace overshadows the law hallelujah and then here comes boaz who's actually near kisman to naomi and the only way that naomi can get her estate back and all these things can happen you know is that boaz marries ruth and boaz just happens to see ruth in his field fall in love with her many many times you think things are just providential i just happen to be at the right place at the right time and hear the right thing i just yo it's just chance there's not chance it's predestinated moments in our lives that god ordains for us to hear the right word at the right time and our hearts are in the right condition hallelujah for us to receive it and then so here so then boaz marries ruth hallelujah and and in the process redeems naomi's lost estate and restores it back now it's exactly the same thing where where boaz the mighty man of wealth we know that is a type of christ and he marries a gentile in order to restore the jews back to their last possession so now the prophet tells us that that that that boaz marrying ruth is the same as the lamb taking the book hallelujah so it's exactly the same so what it is now is is the union so so it's not just the lord claiming a whole dispensation of people and revealing what's in them it's actually god taking you opening the mystery of your life hallelujah and revealing what's watson you now remember brother braham says that the opening of the seals reveals christ now where is christ to be revealed in you right not just in here this has got to live i mean this is just ink on paper without the spirit of god taken to a spirit-filled life and it manifesting a character hallelujah so it's actually it's actually when he takes the book it's symbolic of him claiming you back because no one was found worthy to redeem you back to where you should have been before the fall no man is worthy no prophet all the prophets were there the holy men great men of the ages were there i mean even joseph was standing there the only one thing held against him was one lie when his father came down to down to egypt he said yo before you tell pharaoh your occupation don't say you're a shepherd it's an abomination to the egyptians you know color it in a little bit you know give yourself a promotion but you know give it but but you know so that was the one mark against him his whole life because every man's got to fail so all the holy men were there all the prophets all the you know believers down through the ages but there was no man hallelujah but one and when john first looked he couldn't see him because he was he was interceding for the ages now now before i continue on with this he still is an intercessor because it's part of his character right he's still an intercessor because his blood you know people say well he's off the mercy seat now because he stepped off the throne to take the book well the scriptures tell us heaven is my throne this is in isaiah 66 and 1 thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool where is the house that you will build unto me and where is the place of my rest so he's still on his throne because he's in heaven his physical body is still in heaven right so he's still there making a decision for you and i that's not crazy is it no so people say and and then also the prophet tells us very simply you know when jesus was hanging on calvary he says the mercy seat was in plain beyond calvary so the mercy seat wasn't a piece of furniture it was a person which it always has been a person right so so now he is always a seat of mercy to those he gives mercy to remember the high priest went in with names over his heart to get mercy for them hallelujah with blood to get mercy for them it's the same thing with you and i i mean the scripture tells us that that that we are engraved in the palm of his hands let's find that scripture i have it somewhere i like these you know i like these kind of scriptures because it's telling me the lord says you know i can't leave thee nor forsake thee i can't forget you hallelujah isaiah 49 13 oh sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but zion said now we're going to look at our what's our confession and what's god's confession our confession should match god's confession amen so the lord is saying sing be joyful break forth into singing for the lord's comforted confidence people and her and will have mercy upon his afflicted we get afflicted from time to time but then the next verse says but zion said so now zion's the bride this is her confession the lord hath forsaken me and the lord hath forgotten me but in the previous verse he's just said no i've comforted my people and i'll have mercy upon my i mean i mean he's afflicted but then the bride's saying no i'm forsaken hold on but then the lord says can a woman forget her suckling child sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palm of my hands thy walls are continually before me so he said um you know i don't know how a mother could forget a child right all those who have given birth here i don't know how you could forget a child you've brought to the earth but he says they can forget but i can't forget you i've graven thee upon the palm of my hands and then he says in isaiah 49 o zion thou bringeth forth good tidings get thee up into the high mountain of jerusalem that bringeth forth good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord god will come with a strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young so the lord's telling us now he's going to carry us in his bosom he's going to hold us close hallelujah he says that he we are engraved in the palm of his hands so we're a part of him it's not just a you know a garment that he puts on with our names on our names are a part of him hallelujah now so he's he always is mercy because remember when he takes the book there's still the jews that have to be gathered as well right so the blood that he shed on calvary was for our atonement and for their atonement now we're where was i now so heaven in his heaven is his throne and earth is his footstool so that tells me that he can take the book but still be in heaven interceding right so and then he sent down the revelation of the contents of that book in revelations 10. amen an anointing came down from heaven with an open book to make us see who who we really are in christ every promise would come into manifestation in this hour amen so god's throne is not a chair it's a place heaven is my throne so there he is so so mercy only comes to an end for the gentiles when they did in christ race so right now there's still mercy hallelujah i need an intercessor every day of my life i need that blood every day amen but i won't need it when this body's changed right hallelujah but the jews still need it because there comes a time when those jews change their song in revelations 15 and 1 he says another um i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them has filled up the wrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and then that had gotten the victory over the beast over his image over his mark over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having harps of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb now we don't sing the song of moses this is a jewish song i mean we you know you can see the song after the red sea where they when they look back and they see the enemy is drowned in the red sea and the anointing of god falls upon them moses and says the nice and he sang a song of victory hallelujah but they also sing the song of the lamb amen so these are the jews that have received the same christ we know hallelujah saying great and marvelous thy works lord god almighty true just and true thy ways thou king of saints who shall not fear thee o lord and magnify thy name for thou art for only for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgment is made manifest hallelujah now it's a time of trouble when the bride is gathered and raptured now we won't i see time has just ran away somewhere so so i don't want to keep you too long but you read psalms 27 maybe we'll just read it quickly i won't make many comments but brother brown when he preaches the rapture message he opens that sermon with psalms 27 because he's saying this is the condition of the people that go on the rapture and this is the condition the earth will be and when the rapture takes place he says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid i trust this is your testimony oh i'm now i'm now reading when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell you know there came a time where the enemy came against you and you stumbled and fell but there's got to come a time where the holy ghost comes and overcoming power that same enemy comes against you but he stumbles and falls it's not you stumbling and falling hallelujah why because the holy ghost gives overcoming power there's nothing too difficult for him in a believer's life hallelujah amen though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple so what is the believer's heart after they receive the holy ghost lord i just want to be where you are i just want to praise you i just want to give you glory i just want to love you more and more that's the condition of the believer i mean for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock now why is it a secret because the devil doesn't know this place of being united you know the devil is really close to god up in heaven but he's not as close as the bride is with god because we're one the devil and god just had a working relationship but we have a union a love affair a marriage amen and he shall set me up upon a rock you know i think about sitting up upon a rock yeah you lift up one of your children you put them up on a on a on a on a table you set them up somewhere who does that yeah you set them up somewhere so so now they're up high looking down on everything their view has been lifted up they're once looking down here now they're up here looking down hallelujah now we've been lifted up we're on a rock revelation we can see from eternity to eternity we know who we are in christ we know who christ is amen we know who our god is we know his the power of his redemption we know also the devil's very limited power just being a bluff he's defeated amen and we know that he's going to a lag of fire we're going into glory hallelujah so never ever let the devil try and rob the fact that you know who you are the devil doesn't believe who you are he went to the lord himself if they'll be if they'll be the son of god you know if he wasn't sure and if he really was sure he would never have let the crucifixion take place but he wasn't sure if you're really the son of god come off the cross and we'll believe you that was the devil anointing them saying if you really are do this and we'll go prove it this way prove it how i want you to prove it and then i'll believe it don't people do it the same way if this message really is true then it's going to be xyz then i'll believe it hold on it's revelation not not not a mental understanding it was a mental understanding the scribes and pharisees would have been in the upper room but they weren't amen so and then and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing i'll sing praises unto the lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me we're now said to seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek this so in the god you know when the lord speaks to do something it's actually your heart responding it's a deep calling to it deep calling to a deep harlot this is the condition of a believer amen during the time of the rapture he says now it'll be in a time of trouble and and that's why i went to joseph's time there because it was a time of great famine great trouble in the world when he when he gathers his bride takes a rapture then reveals himself to the jews just exactly like today i mean this did there is trouble on every hand but we are not in that trouble hallelujah now brother abraham and the rapture message as well he would he would go into speaking of the resurrection of lazarus and he would say that the resurrection of lazarus types the gathering of the living bride to bring the dead in christ from the grave now i'll just touch on this very briefly but mary and martha weren't dancing skipping and jumping having a wonderful time when jesus was coming to their house to gather the living bride together their brother had just died people had come to comfort them and obviously they're just pouring a whole bunch of unbelief if he really was your buddy he would have been here why did he go somewhere else didn't you send word i'm so sorry he died but but but then you send word and you know but he said i'm going to go this way why'd he come here if he really had all power he would have come if he really was the messiah oh this must been a too hard basket i think you've caught up in a cult i think you've gone been been influenced the wrong way and you know this is obviously the fruit of what you believe he won't come and do it but remember the lord has a purpose for everything if we just stand still you see the salvation of the lord uh leah so so jesus is never late we we think many times he's late but he's right on time hallelujah so now here is here is mary and martha and then jesus it says in john 11 17 then when jesus came he found that they had later he had laid in the gray grave four days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the jews came to mary and martha to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house you know some people go quick some people take a while but as long as you get there because if you're being gathered if your name is over his heart you're to come hallelujah so they are both under the sadness and brokenness of losing their brother but one left the sadness of their past and went to him the other one was still there but jesus was not going to go raise the dead saints till they were all gathered the dead in christ aren't going to rise until all the living have come into christ i mean that are on the lamb's book of life hallelujah then when martha said unto jesus lord if thou had has been here my brother had not died but i know i know but i know that even now whatever thou ask of god god will give it thee jesus sat unto her thy brother shall rise again martha said saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day but the lord doesn't want us to look at a promise in the future he wants it present and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so he says i am the resurrection present tense right now and the life present tense and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and a believer says yay lord she said it she that she saith unto him yay lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said she went away and called mary her sister secretly saying the master come and calleth for thee that's why we have a ministry we're going to find the mary's of this world the master's come he's descended his spirit is upon the earth he's a sinner with a shout amen hallelujah now we're going to find the mary's and say the master's here physically you say well is he come or is he coming well his spirit's here but he's still coming because we'll meet him in the air right that body brother ram says those sacred feet will not touch the earth when the bride goes because we'll meet him in the air hallelujah but so in a way he's come but he's coming so so it's our commission to find the mary's who are still stuck in the disappointment of power your religious disappointment of the past call them to come to where jesus is which is the word for this hour as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him hallelujah what to do the now now the living bride was gathered for the dead in christ to come forth out of the grave brother abraham says in the rapture message and and i'll just finish with this now it's the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a uh a shout then a voice and then a trumpet now he's speaking at first thessalonians 4 shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice a loud voice in saint john 11 38-44 that called lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place and what is next uh of a shout a voice a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always as the feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky see so the first thing comes forth uh is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones who died back in other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast and the heavens and the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends hallelujah so we're living in this moment of a time of trouble amen but we've been gathered hallelujah see he is still interceding for us in the heavens we still have a high priest but once every name that's on his book that's over his heart he says dipped in blood redeemed yes then we're going to meet him in the air hallelujah amen aren't you glad i just finished with that aren't you glad now that when he went to calvary when he ascended up high after that we're over his heart hallelujah that he wasn't just going through some kind of business transaction of you know i'll die and see what happens maybe these people were will will feel sorry and you know give their lives and live for me no no he he had a number of names on his heart hallelujah and he died for you and i ascended up now he's there making intercession his spirits upon the earth to gather us in this time of trouble and once the living saints are gathered the dead in christ arises we've got to meet him in the air hallelujah and then he'll turn back to the jews amen so we're living in a tremendous time but go go go listen to the breach if you haven't recently it's an event not just a dispensational event it's the lord claiming you just like ruth what was in ruth she was she was actually part of a dispensational change to go from the time of judges to the time of kings and it was through her that change began to take place because out of her eventually came david right because she was the great grandmother of great you know go go go read it you'll see so it's through us now by him taking a gentile bride as a dispensational change from the time the church ages then through a bright coming of christ now there's going to be a millennium come in hallelujah anyway can we have the musicians uh come please but you know it's it's a personal thing hallelujah i trust it's a real you know it's not just an ideal you say this is a time of trouble it's okay it's perfectly fine don't be anxious for nothing but with everything prayer and supplication make your request known unto god amen give him thanks just walk with him amen do we know that song um we haven't sung it for a while we we um sometimes you sing at home you know any day now my lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me i'll be watching and i'll be waiting any day now his face i'll see we need some words though who knows that song hallelujah amen if we don't have the words for it maybe yeah no it should be just any day now my lord is coming

goodness falling on us lord where would we be without you thank you put something in our hearts lord put a revelation in our souls that we're going to say goodbye world hallelujah lord there's a time

dead in christ arise even in this time of trouble lord we see my lord we see a time of trouble and joseph stay in that gathering and lord we see a time of trouble even when when mary martin there was
