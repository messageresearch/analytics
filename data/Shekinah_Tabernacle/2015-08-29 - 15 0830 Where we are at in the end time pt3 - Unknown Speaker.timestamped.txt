[57:17] September so don't pencil it into your

[57:23] that would be that' be wonderful if we
[57:25] could have that uh that's only
[57:27] announcement um also if you could so the
[57:30] play centers moved out upstairs and um I
[57:33] had a quick look through and uh just
[57:36] pray because the price needs to be right
[57:38] and there's a lot of things that need to
[57:39] be done and it may not be a definite but
[57:41] we know that if the Lord uh doesn't want
[57:45] us there he'll have us somewhere else
[57:47] amen so just if you keep that in prayer
[57:49] that'd be very good
[57:50] thing um if you'd like to turn me to
[57:53] Genesis chapter 24 I just
[57:57] um I just like to continue on our
[58:00] thought about where we are in the end
[58:02] times and I want to you know there's
[58:05] many things that we can speak about you
[58:07] know about where we are and in time and
[58:10] these things but and we will cover those
[58:12] things you know as the Lord leads but I
[58:14] want to speak about the most important
[58:16] thing this is the most important thing
[58:19] and we'll just read the first seven
[58:21] verses of Genesis 24 and we understand
[58:24] this is the chapter where alas was sent
[58:26] to get a bride for Isaac and I want to
[58:28] show you that this this chapter is alive
[58:30] and well today it's even more alive than
[58:33] when it was lived out and alasar and
[58:35] Rebecca and these things that was just a
[58:37] shadow and we are living out the reality
[58:39] of it yes sir amen so we just we're just
[58:41] going to go through a bit of this here
[58:43] so he says and Abraham was old so verse
[58:45] one of Genesis 24 and Abraham was old
[58:47] and well stricken in age and the Lord
[58:50] had blessed Abraham in all things and
[58:52] Abraham said unto his eldest servant of
[58:54] his house that ruled over all that he
[58:56] had put I pray thee thy hand under my
[58:59] thigh and I'll make thee swear by the
[59:01] Lord the god of Heaven and the god of
[59:03] the earth Thou shalt not take a wife
[59:06] unto my son of the daughters of the
[59:07] Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou
[59:10] shalt go into my country and unto my
[59:12] Kindred and take a wife unto my son
[59:14] Isaac and the servant said unto him pray
[59:16] Adventure the woman will not be willing
[59:18] to follow me unto this land must I needs
[59:20] bring my son again into the land from
[59:22] whence thou comest and Abraham said unto
[59:24] him beware that thou uh bring not my son
[59:28] hither again the Lord God Of Heaven
[59:31] which took me from my father's house and
[59:32] from the land of my Kindred and which
[59:34] spake unto me and that swear unto me
[59:37] saying unto thy seed will I give this
[59:40] land he shall send his Angel before thee
[59:43] and thou shalt take a wife uh unto my
[59:47] son from then amen my the Lord bless his
[59:50] word you may be
[59:52] seated now you know as I said there's
[59:55] you know speaking about the end time and
[59:57] if you go on to YouTube or on the
[59:59] Internet you know there's there's a lot
[1:00:01] of uh talk of of the you know we're at
[1:00:04] the end of all things and we are at the
[1:00:05] end of all things but you know we could
[1:00:07] be many people can see what the pope is
[1:00:10] doing and the pope is doing many things
[1:00:12] he's fulfilling scripture we can see
[1:00:14] what the World Council of churches is
[1:00:16] doing which is the image to the Beast
[1:00:17] and they are fulfilling scripture and
[1:00:19] I'll cover these things later on but you
[1:00:21] know many people they look at those
[1:00:22] things they look at America and where
[1:00:24] she is standing and she is fulfilling
[1:00:26] scripture and we can also look at God's
[1:00:29] time piece Israel and they are
[1:00:31] fulfilling scripture they're all part of
[1:00:32] the end time plan and then we could also
[1:00:35] see that Russia is taking her position
[1:00:38] you know she is taking her position in
[1:00:40] the scripture and she is fulfilling you
[1:00:42] know she has become anointed because she
[1:00:44] is Anointed to destroy not only America
[1:00:47] but also the Vatican and so she is
[1:00:50] taking her position and we understand
[1:00:52] that brother Braham when he saw the
[1:00:54] seven major visions of 193 3 when it
[1:00:57] spoke of you know there would be Nazism
[1:00:59] and fascism and communism and the first
[1:01:01] two Nazism and fascism be swallowed up
[1:01:03] in communism but then it said he said
[1:01:06] watch Russia the King of the North and
[1:01:08] we understand as as you go into history
[1:01:10] Nazism raised up fascism raised up
[1:01:12] communism raised up and Comm communism
[1:01:15] swallowed up the first two isms but
[1:01:17] notice the Lord told him don't wash a
[1:01:19] Soviet Union watch Russia watch Russia
[1:01:22] the King of the North and because of
[1:01:24] that time when he began to Proclaim
[1:01:26] these things the Soviet Union was at its
[1:01:27] strength you know they were looking for
[1:01:29] another you know nuclear war they they
[1:01:31] believed was imminent between America
[1:01:33] and the Soviet Union but God was telling
[1:01:36] telling us don't worry about the Soviet
[1:01:38] Union wait until that that that crumbles
[1:01:42] and then Russia raises up again they're
[1:01:43] saying watch Russia the King of the
[1:01:45] North and we see Russia is taking her
[1:01:48] position and all these things are very
[1:01:51] important because they're part of the
[1:01:52] end time plan that God has placed in his
[1:01:54] wor but the most important part of his
[1:01:57] plan is that God would gather a bride
[1:01:59] for his son in this last day and because
[1:02:02] brother brandham he tells us he he
[1:02:04] preaches a sermon which is called a true
[1:02:07] sign overlooked and that and that true
[1:02:09] sign overlooked in the land is a prophet
[1:02:10] coming into the land because when a
[1:02:12] prophet is sent upon the Earth there's a
[1:02:14] major change being taking place like
[1:02:16] when Noah when Noah was here upon the
[1:02:19] Earth you know God was going to flood
[1:02:20] the Earth destroy the Earth and he was
[1:02:22] going to carry a people who would
[1:02:24] receive that that prophet's message
[1:02:26] that'd be carried over the Judgment into
[1:02:27] a new world and so it wasn't necessarily
[1:02:31] the sins of the people that were the
[1:02:32] signs of the times the true sign that
[1:02:34] was overlooked was Noah was standing
[1:02:36] there and he began to preach a message
[1:02:38] sent from God and it's the same thing
[1:02:40] when you when you see when you know when
[1:02:42] Moses was here you know he was a signed
[1:02:45] you know Elijah he was a signed John the
[1:02:47] Baptist was a signed every time God
[1:02:50] sends a prophet that is a true sign that
[1:02:52] God sends the prophet comes and he
[1:02:55] preaches the word word in its season and
[1:02:57] he declares to the people this is where
[1:02:58] you are in the scripture but many people
[1:03:01] they stumble over these signs and they
[1:03:02] look at say what America is doing and
[1:03:05] what the Pope's doing what the World
[1:03:06] Council of churches are doing and they
[1:03:07] look at all these things but they miss
[1:03:09] the true sign that's overlooked amen now
[1:03:12] brother bam he speaks this is after he
[1:03:13] preaches so he preaches a sermon uh this
[1:03:16] is uh this is from the voice of the sign
[1:03:18] in 1964 and in uh in balmont Texas he
[1:03:22] says a prophet himself is a sign the
[1:03:24] Bible said so which you see times
[1:03:26] lapsing and then see coming take the
[1:03:28] history of the Bible study it whenever
[1:03:31] you see a long lapse of
[1:03:33] time then uh and uh but just when you
[1:03:36] seen a prophet appear it was a sign of
[1:03:39] judgment God was going to judge the
[1:03:40] world all the nation or the people when
[1:03:43] you saw a prophet coming he preached a
[1:03:45] sermon I he said sorry he says I
[1:03:47] preached a sermon on that you take me
[1:03:49] and remember a true sign overlooked they
[1:03:52] always Overlook it they always have but
[1:03:54] it was a sign of coming judgment now his
[1:03:57] word is fulfilled his word is fulfilled
[1:04:01] in his voice what he promises then he
[1:04:03] fulfills his word by The Voice the
[1:04:05] coming of a prophet is a warning sign
[1:04:08] that judgment is at hand always has been
[1:04:11] he says let me just quote one look at
[1:04:13] Noah rising up in the last days of the
[1:04:15] Andel luvian World a prophet prophesying
[1:04:17] what was it judgment struck immediately
[1:04:20] after that Moses went into Egypt a
[1:04:22] Vindicated Prophet with the signs of a
[1:04:24] prophet what happened judgment struck
[1:04:26] Egypt right afterwards Elijah came on
[1:04:28] the scene the prophet and prophesied to
[1:04:29] Ahab and to that Nation what happened
[1:04:32] judgment Struck it right afterwards he
[1:04:34] says right John the Baptist come on as a
[1:04:35] sign and he goes on down but now there
[1:04:39] comes there comes a you know there comes
[1:04:43] a a time though where the what we look
[1:04:47] at now is a change and brother man
[1:04:50] speaks about it and what is the
[1:04:51] attraction on the mountain and he says
[1:04:53] and and in that sermon he he takes the
[1:04:55] text of Jesus right you writing up in
[1:04:58] Jerusalem on the back of the donkey and
[1:05:00] they say what is this and it says what
[1:05:02] is the attraction what's going on what's
[1:05:03] really going on here and he says he says
[1:05:06] this is just St says he said it was
[1:05:08] prophecy being fulfilled and about the
[1:05:10] time the prophet turned and said behold
[1:05:12] there comes a lamb of God to take away
[1:05:14] the sin of the world this is speaking of
[1:05:15] John the Baptist there prophecy being
[1:05:17] fulfilled now what's the attraction it's
[1:05:19] changed from the prophet to his prophecy
[1:05:23] so the attraction there's a time where
[1:05:25] there's the prophet upon the land and
[1:05:27] then the attraction turns now from the
[1:05:28] prophet to what he's speaking about what
[1:05:31] he's declaring that's where the
[1:05:32] attraction turns and so I just want to
[1:05:36] propose to you now a true sign
[1:05:38] overlooked because sure brother br's
[1:05:40] Ministry is a true sign because a
[1:05:42] prophet is a sign to the age that
[1:05:44] judgment's about to strike but a true
[1:05:46] sign but you know that was 50 years ago
[1:05:49] and so as I propose a question a few
[1:05:51] Sundays ago where are we at the end time
[1:05:54] because we've seen the son of man as
[1:05:55] been revealed you know Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] himself was manifested in the ministry
[1:05:59] of brother brandham and that was more
[1:06:01] than just a discernment and the angel of
[1:06:03] the Lord there the words coming out of
[1:06:04] his mouth that was Jesus Christ being
[1:06:06] revealed because he was revealing it was
[1:06:08] revealing Christ in the scripture so
[1:06:10] Jesus was being declared Paul said I
[1:06:12] preached to you Jesus Christ amen so he
[1:06:15] was preaching Jesus Christ and that was
[1:06:18] that was the son of man being
[1:06:20] revealed and so we can see because Jesus
[1:06:23] himself said as it was in the days of
[1:06:24] lot as was the days of Noah so shall it
[1:06:27] be when the son of man is revealed and
[1:06:30] you Luke 17 so we can see you know he
[1:06:32] says so we can read about now when the
[1:06:35] world is in that condition as was in the
[1:06:37] days of Noah and we can say we are in
[1:06:39] those days and then we can look and see
[1:06:41] the Sodom condition in the world again
[1:06:43] and we're living in those days and that
[1:06:45] was when God came in flesh and spoke to
[1:06:48] Abraham you know you know all know the
[1:06:49] story of world Genesis 18 said the Lord
[1:06:52] appeared to Abraham on the plains of
[1:06:53] mamory here came the of visitation where
[1:06:56] they would receive the promised son and
[1:06:59] God now you know God came in a human
[1:07:02] body he created a human body and stepped
[1:07:04] into it and and had a meal with Abraham
[1:07:07] and he said where is thy wife Sarah
[1:07:09] she's in the tent behind you and and God
[1:07:12] says to Abraham according to time of
[1:07:14] life which is speaking of a woman not a
[1:07:16] man according to time of life you shall
[1:07:18] receive the promised son and she's in
[1:07:20] the T behind laughing laughing within
[1:07:22] herself saying I'm old how can I please
[1:07:24] with my Lord this is impossible possible
[1:07:26] and God says why did Sarah laugh
[1:07:28] speaking to Abraham and she came out and
[1:07:30] said no I didn't laugh said yes you did
[1:07:32] and that was and Jesus did the same
[1:07:34] thing to the woman at the well revealed
[1:07:35] who she was and everyone's life and all
[1:07:37] these things and and Jesus said now in
[1:07:39] the end time that will that Ministry my
[1:07:41] ministry will be repeated but instead of
[1:07:44] Jesus coming in a body like you know how
[1:07:46] we were the first time he took a
[1:07:48] redeemed son of man a redeemed man and
[1:07:51] stepped into that body and declared
[1:07:52] himself to the
[1:07:54] Nations and and we can and that was a
[1:07:56] sign of the end but now I want to
[1:07:59] propose to you now because that was 50
[1:08:01] years ago that manifestation brother bam
[1:08:04] tells us this is the last sign the
[1:08:06] church will get before the world is
[1:08:07] burned the last major sign amen because
[1:08:11] after God came down in Genesis 18 spoke
[1:08:13] to Abraham the called out group then he
[1:08:16] went down and and fire fell upon Sodom
[1:08:18] and it was destroyed so was the last
[1:08:20] major
[1:08:22] visitation but part of that visitation I
[1:08:25] just want to propose you now part of the
[1:08:27] end time where we are is now as I said
[1:08:31] it changes brother speaking about it
[1:08:33] changes from the prophet to the prophecy
[1:08:36] so it changes from himself now to what
[1:08:39] he's Min you what he's prophesying of
[1:08:41] speaking will come and then so we have
[1:08:43] to look now turn from the man and look
[1:08:46] at what he spoke about and his prophecy
[1:08:49] now was he was sent and this is why he
[1:08:52] was sent he was sent to turn your hearts
[1:08:55] to the faith of the fathers that you'd
[1:08:57] be United with Jesus Christ you'd be
[1:08:59] married to him this is why he was sent
[1:09:02] it's not just to no Bible Doctrine is
[1:09:04] that you'd become one for the very
[1:09:06] creator of heavens and earth youd become
[1:09:08] one with him and then you'd be taken up
[1:09:10] in a Rapture that's why the message was
[1:09:12] sent brother B says my message is that
[1:09:14] he is here yeah we sung that song and he
[1:09:17] is here and God is here and I'll go into
[1:09:19] that he is absolutely here I want to see
[1:09:22] Jesus Jesus is here amen amen Jesus is
[1:09:25] is here right now if you can believe it
[1:09:27] he's here right now and so his prophecy
[1:09:31] was his prophecy was there's going to be
[1:09:33] a bride there's been churches churches
[1:09:36] Brides brides but there's got to come
[1:09:37] one he speaks about so that was his
[1:09:39] prophecy there's coming one and he said
[1:09:42] that she she spoke of it as wheat
[1:09:44] because we're wheat amen the wheat is
[1:09:47] gathered into the Garner right and so
[1:09:49] the bride it's just it's just a
[1:09:51] different using a different name but
[1:09:53] it's the same thing the wheat of the
[1:09:54] kingdom is the bride of Christ and he
[1:09:56] said the wheat is here he said this back
[1:09:59] in the 50s and 60s the wheat he's saying
[1:10:01] the bride is present I mean that part of
[1:10:03] the Bride is already present and now we
[1:10:05] have lived down Through the Ages down
[1:10:07] here a few Generations down the road and
[1:10:08] we're all still part of that number amen
[1:10:11] y so he's saying now he's saying the
[1:10:13] bride is here and he said his ministry
[1:10:15] was to unite Christ the man and the
[1:10:18] woman the church the bride unite them as
[1:10:21] one when he preached you know the
[1:10:23] invisible Union he was it was actually
[1:10:26] like a a marriage ceremony going on Amen
[1:10:30] this was the this is why John the
[1:10:31] Baptist was here he was the he was the
[1:10:34] friend of the bridegroom and he speaks
[1:10:35] about it and he was to introduce when he
[1:10:38] called the people out he was calling out
[1:10:41] a bride for the promised son amen and
[1:10:44] then and then when he so he called the
[1:10:46] people out was preaching and then the
[1:10:48] bridegroom came he said there's one
[1:10:50] standing among you the bride he
[1:10:51] basically could have said the bridegroom
[1:10:52] is
[1:10:53] present amen and then when he saw the
[1:10:56] spirit of God you know he saw that this
[1:10:57] is the Lamb this is the bridegroom
[1:10:59] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:11:01] the sin of the world this is the
[1:11:02] bridegroom and then he United the two
[1:11:05] together he says I must decrease he must
[1:11:07] increase so basically saying don't hang
[1:11:10] around with me I'm just introduce you
[1:11:12] and now I've introduce you go on your
[1:11:13] way amen amen it's the same thing John
[1:11:17] he had the spirit of Elijah upon him to
[1:11:20] introduce the church to its head and the
[1:11:23] same thing brother BR God said I send
[1:11:25] the the spirit of Elijah upon the Earth
[1:11:27] what's the purpose to unite the church
[1:11:30] and its head Christ amen that they would
[1:11:33] become one amen and so a true sign that
[1:11:36] is overlooked now because we've turned
[1:11:38] from the prophet to its prophecy is a
[1:11:40] true sign overlooked now is the bride
[1:11:43] coming into her position amen that is a
[1:11:45] true sign of the end time where are we
[1:11:49] amen you say well I I need to know where
[1:11:51] we are in the end time look in God's
[1:11:53] mirror yes and see how it is living out
[1:11:56] of you amen when your character his
[1:11:59] character becomes your character his
[1:12:01] nature becomes your nature that would be
[1:12:03] partakers of the divine nature amen this
[1:12:05] is the true sign a true sign it's the
[1:12:08] prophecy now coming into
[1:12:11] manifestation are you all following me
[1:12:13] so far you say well I don't know if I'm
[1:12:15] going to make it if you're ordained to
[1:12:17] make
[1:12:18] it God has held back god god holds back
[1:12:22] all the enemy and what he thinks he's
[1:12:24] doing yes our woman comes forth made in
[1:12:27] made in God's image and when she is so
[1:12:30] exactly like him he's going to take her
[1:12:32] off off this earth right that is so you
[1:12:37] know we can look at Israel and we can
[1:12:39] look at Russia and we can look at all
[1:12:40] these things sure we can keep those
[1:12:43] things in mind but don't major on those
[1:12:45] things amen God's one focus is you the
[1:12:50] Bride of Jesus Christ is God's one Focus
[1:12:53] he doesn't really care hey all those
[1:12:54] things are working for his will but
[1:12:56] that's not his main focus you are his
[1:12:58] main focus the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:13:01] his main focus am amen so we must always
[1:13:04] remember that now that the
[1:13:07] prophecy we we we're we're to look now
[1:13:11] from the prophet to the prophecy and
[1:13:13] then we should look at now where is the
[1:13:15] bride in her position is she a little
[1:13:17] girl is she a teenager or is she a
[1:13:21] mature woman amen amen he say well I've
[1:13:25] only been a Believer maybe a few years
[1:13:27] God said he'll do a quick short work at
[1:13:29] the end time a rapid time of maturity
[1:13:31] will come forth just meet him amen
[1:13:34] that's all you have to do become one
[1:13:36] with
[1:13:37] Isaac amen that's all you have to do and
[1:13:39] then he'll mature you he'll grow you
[1:13:41] amen that's right that's all you need to
[1:13:43] do now because God now God always has a
[1:13:49] living witness upon the Earth he always
[1:13:52] have a living witness and so we are
[1:13:56] because brother ad tells us he says that
[1:13:58] the that the bride under her Messenger
[1:14:01] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:14:04] amen yes so the bride the ones who have
[1:14:06] become one with Christ not just church
[1:14:09] joiners not just you know cultural
[1:14:11] message people but really meet him they
[1:14:15] their life is the final voice and
[1:14:16] they're the true sign overlooked now am
[1:14:19] people stumble at the Simplicity of God
[1:14:22] becoming one with his people and so that
[1:14:25] true sign overlooked if I might just add
[1:14:27] to it I might say is the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:29] Christ amen coming into her position
[1:14:32] because once she comes into her position
[1:14:34] then she's taken off this
[1:14:36] Earth that's all that God doesn't care
[1:14:38] about the Vatican it's just a tool God
[1:14:40] doesn't care about Russia it's just a
[1:14:42] tool God doesn't care about world
[1:14:44] Catholic churches it's just a tool God
[1:14:47] cares about Israel because he's going to
[1:14:48] turn to Israel but before he can turn to
[1:14:50] Israel he has to take you out of this
[1:14:52] place that's amen so that's why you know
[1:14:55] we can go
[1:14:56] to God
[1:14:59] always
[1:15:01] now God always uses man to preach his
[1:15:04] gospel we see this in Acts chapter 10
[1:15:07] the angel comes to Cornelius he doesn't
[1:15:09] preach the gospel he says go get Peter
[1:15:12] he said I I'd love a Heavenly being to
[1:15:14] come and preach the word to
[1:15:16] me God uses
[1:15:18] man and he and he sends two guys and
[1:15:21] they go and they get this guy Peter
[1:15:24] aiter man can't sign his own name he
[1:15:26] begins to speak preach to them it wasn't
[1:15:29] when the angel preaches when God used an
[1:15:31] anointed vessel and preached his word
[1:15:33] and the spirit of God fell upon those
[1:15:35] people amen and so and that is the way
[1:15:38] all the way down through now let's just
[1:15:41] turn to to uh Revelations chapter 10 I
[1:15:43] just want to drop a few things in
[1:15:46] because we alaza does not only just
[1:15:50] speak of speak of the enti messenger and
[1:15:53] I'm going to show you in the word but
[1:15:55] also speaks of the people who have come
[1:15:56] under that same
[1:15:58] anointing amen because we have the same
[1:16:01] Ministry of reconciliation that we have
[1:16:04] become one with God and now the very
[1:16:06] intent and the purpose of the bride of
[1:16:08] Christ is that other others would come
[1:16:10] to know him as well sir y amen hey I'm I
[1:16:14] trust that is the main focus of your
[1:16:16] life if there not for people on the
[1:16:18] street it should be for your family amen
[1:16:20] that they must know him amen doesn't
[1:16:23] matter how young hey I have it in my
[1:16:25] little mind if my if my baby can respond
[1:16:27] to me can recognize me she can sure
[1:16:31] recognize the one who made her amen amen
[1:16:34] amen now we read many times we read
[1:16:37] Revelations 10 1-7 but I just want to go
[1:16:39] on from Revelations uh 107 because
[1:16:42] remember we're going from the prophet to
[1:16:43] his prophecy speaking of future things
[1:16:45] now he says now but in the days of the
[1:16:47] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:16:49] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:16:51] be finished as he has declared to his
[1:16:52] servants the prophets so in the days of
[1:16:54] his voice and we're living in those days
[1:16:56] because that voice was recorded that you
[1:16:58] could hear that voice and absorb that
[1:17:00] voice become one with that voice amen
[1:17:03] amen and now and the voice which I heard
[1:17:06] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:17:08] go and take the little book which is
[1:17:10] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:17:12] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:17:14] which is Christ and I went unto the
[1:17:17] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:17:19] little book and he said to me take it
[1:17:20] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[1:17:22] belly bitter but it shall be uh in thy
[1:17:26] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:17:28] honey so it's sweet when you talk about
[1:17:30] it but there's a purging that has to go
[1:17:32] on this old life Must Die amen so that's
[1:17:35] why it can be bitter in the belly
[1:17:36] because when you when you receive it
[1:17:38] it's wonderful but then now these things
[1:17:40] are going to be taken out of you and
[1:17:42] things got to be molded and you know
[1:17:43] your old nature must die that's when it
[1:17:45] becomes
[1:17:47] bitter and I took the little book out of
[1:17:50] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:17:51] was in my mouth uh sweet as honey is as
[1:17:54] soon as I'd eaten that my belly was
[1:17:55] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:17:58] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:18:01] Nations and kindreds um many peoples and
[1:18:04] Nations and tongues and Kings now we
[1:18:06] understand that John John did not do
[1:18:08] these things and John himself is a
[1:18:10] symbol in the Book of Revelation we read
[1:18:12] in Revelations 4:1 when he said after
[1:18:14] these things after the seven Church ages
[1:18:16] there's a door was open in heaven and a
[1:18:19] voice said come up hither and I'll show
[1:18:21] you things to come and that is showing
[1:18:23] now John was representative there of the
[1:18:26] Bride that is raptured with the both the
[1:18:29] dead and Christ Rising first and we
[1:18:30] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:18:32] caught up with them to meet the Lord in
[1:18:34] the cloud so John himself is a symbol in
[1:18:37] the book amen and so John here is not
[1:18:41] just speak of himself because he did not
[1:18:43] go you know he did not go on a big
[1:18:45] Evangelistic tour after after he wrote
[1:18:47] This Book of Revelation you know but he
[1:18:50] went to the church at Ephesus and he
[1:18:51] passed that when he was released so now
[1:18:54] John here is speaking of a people he's
[1:18:56] not speaking of just himself when he
[1:18:57] said thou must prophesy again and thou
[1:19:00] must eat the book and these things but
[1:19:02] he's speaking of an end time people that
[1:19:04] the word has been open to that Christ
[1:19:06] has been revealed to and so we are under
[1:19:09] a mandate from God we're under a
[1:19:11] commission y amen that thou must take
[1:19:13] what has been received you must become
[1:19:15] one with it yes amen don't just talk
[1:19:18] about it and and maybe tack it onto your
[1:19:20] life but it must be the very strength of
[1:19:22] your life am man shall not live by bread
[1:19:24] Al but every word that proceeds out of
[1:19:27] the mouth of God hallelujah but how do
[1:19:28] you know it's out of the mouth of God
[1:19:30] because God will take a vessel and he'll
[1:19:32] vindicate that vessel with scriptural
[1:19:34] evidence a scriptural Vindication and
[1:19:36] that's how you know it's God Amen when
[1:19:39] brother AR can say now he's here and you
[1:19:43] know has the prayer line in these things
[1:19:44] and he says now this is just like it was
[1:19:46] in Genesis 18 and God came down and
[1:19:48] spoke to Abraham or just like how Jesus
[1:19:51] went to the woman at the
[1:19:52] well amen I'm just talking you to
[1:19:55] contact your spirit he where where
[1:19:56] exactly he was taking Jesus out of
[1:20:00] history and saying that same that same
[1:20:03] scripture maybe that you just read is
[1:20:04] being lived out right here amen because
[1:20:07] the son of man was being revealed amen
[1:20:09] that's right amen the you know the
[1:20:11] ministry was repeating
[1:20:13] itself and God and these things you know
[1:20:16] types and shadows are not just oh I you
[1:20:19] know that's neat that that story ties in
[1:20:22] it's not like that that's right he's
[1:20:23] saying all the condition chrans how the
[1:20:25] Believers were there how the unbelievers
[1:20:27] were there The Things They Came against
[1:20:29] all those things are repeating
[1:20:32] themselves amen types are very important
[1:20:35] where you can say because we can look at
[1:20:37] the word and if Jesus said this is how
[1:20:39] it was in the days of Noah it shall be
[1:20:40] like this we can go back to that day and
[1:20:42] we can see the same anointings that were
[1:20:44] upon those people have come upon these
[1:20:46] people and the same thing it was in the
[1:20:48] days of Sodom and Gomorrah we can see
[1:20:50] the anointings that were on them are the
[1:20:52] are the anointings that are out here
[1:20:53] today yes sir amen so now John is told
[1:20:56] now thou must prophesy again now this
[1:21:00] word prophesy is to speak under it's to
[1:21:02] it is to prophesy to foretell things but
[1:21:05] also means now to speak under
[1:21:08] inspiration and many would many would
[1:21:11] say well I'm not a preacher but your
[1:21:14] life
[1:21:15] speaks amen your life your life is a
[1:21:18] sermon that's right you are the only
[1:21:20] Bible many people will ever
[1:21:23] read is is your life you may never say a
[1:21:27] whole bunch but your life is preaching
[1:21:30] amen when you drive down the street when
[1:21:32] you walk into the supermarket when you
[1:21:33] pick your kids up or whatever you know
[1:21:35] you do everyday life you are preaching
[1:21:38] on the street corner amen you're life is
[1:21:41] being read your written epistle read and
[1:21:43] known of all men whether you're
[1:21:45] conscious of it or not your life is
[1:21:47] preaching amen so thou must he says You
[1:21:50] must prophesy again you must speak or
[1:21:53] you must live under an
[1:21:55] inspiration amen because not everyone
[1:21:57] not everyone is a minister but everyone
[1:22:00] must eat the book amen everyone must
[1:22:03] become one with Christ in the first
[1:22:05] Exodus they had to eat the lamb they had
[1:22:07] to become one with that lamb didn't
[1:22:09] matter if they had to eat the head or
[1:22:11] the tail or whatever it was he said eat
[1:22:13] the whole
[1:22:14] thing and some things are real wonderful
[1:22:17] in the word amen we have eternal life we
[1:22:20] have salvation without money or Price
[1:22:22] Jesus loves us those things are
[1:22:23] wonderful those are like the lamb racks
[1:22:25] or whatever you like on the lamb but
[1:22:27] there's other
[1:22:28] things which if you put your hand to it
[1:22:30] you know that the world will despise you
[1:22:34] and will judge you and will speak evil
[1:22:36] of you that's right amen but Jesus said
[1:22:38] blessed are you if the world speaks evil
[1:22:42] you know against You Without a
[1:22:44] Cause amen so there's some parts of the
[1:22:47] Lamb you must become you must eat it
[1:22:50] yeah you must if you want the full
[1:22:52] benefits the full benefits is a rapture
[1:22:55] amen we are here to leave amen amen and
[1:22:58] we're in the season of The Rapture amen
[1:23:01] where Heaven has expanded itself down to
[1:23:03] gather you up and take you up into glory
[1:23:06] and so we don't want to just have a good
[1:23:08] life and then be left behind there's
[1:23:10] people that are going to be left behind
[1:23:12] we don't want to be in that number amen
[1:23:14] we haven't given our lives that would be
[1:23:16] left behind and God hasn't sent this
[1:23:19] message to leave you behind God has sent
[1:23:21] this message and we'll go to Alas I'll
[1:23:23] show this God has sent message that
[1:23:25] you'll become one with Isaac and she
[1:23:27] isn't left in the place that she was
[1:23:29] born amen she isn't left in that same
[1:23:31] country she leaves that country she says
[1:23:34] I'll go Hallelujah and the only factor
[1:23:37] that caused her to leave her country was
[1:23:39] she said I'll go it was down to her
[1:23:41] decision and when you say when you say
[1:23:44] in your heart you say I'm I'm done I'm
[1:23:46] going to go Hallelujah wherever this
[1:23:48] word tells me to go I'm going to follow
[1:23:49] this word I will go amen then everything
[1:23:52] else must give way and you have to go
[1:23:54] amen the power of decision your decision
[1:23:57] will dictate where you want to go well
[1:23:59] there's predestination we're in time am
[1:24:02] mean if you've been sealed into the
[1:24:03] kingdom then you can say I'm
[1:24:05] predestinated cuz the anoint the the the
[1:24:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost the true
[1:24:09] baptism is only for the elected ones
[1:24:13] amen but we don't just want to take this
[1:24:15] haphazard I'm not talking about earning
[1:24:17] your salvation don't get me wrong well

[1:24:34] all kinds of things just live have
[1:24:37] Fellowship one with
[1:24:39] another God if we walk in the light as
[1:24:41] hears in the light we have Fellowship
[1:24:43] one with another is that just in church
[1:24:45] is that just when you open your Bible is
[1:24:46] that just when you go and pray and your

[1:24:59] at work yes at work amen wherever I go
[1:25:02] there's my secret
[1:25:04] place
[1:25:06] Hallelujah so that's the that's the big
[1:25:08] mitigating thing is is is when she said
[1:25:10] I will go now so we are under a mandate
[1:25:14] now we must prophesy again now this this
[1:25:18] this is not to uh speak something
[1:25:21] different but it's just to Echo what we
[1:25:23] have already received received amen like
[1:25:26] Joshua Joshua was given a commission
[1:25:28] place the people in the land he didn't
[1:25:30] bring another word he he took the word
[1:25:33] that Moses was given and he was told to
[1:25:35] meditate upon that and if he meditate
[1:25:38] upon that then they'll be successful he
[1:25:40] didn't preach a different message to
[1:25:41] them he they just carried the same
[1:25:43] message that they were given in the
[1:25:45] wilderness in the mountain it's the same
[1:25:47] thing with us we've been given a word
[1:25:50] all the mysteries of God are finished we
[1:25:52] don't need to wonder and and kind of
[1:25:54] probate maybe I think this is what the
[1:25:56] word says God has shown shown his light
[1:25:58] upon the word and we know what
[1:26:00] everything is from Genesis to Revelation
[1:26:01] amen it's not a mystery amen God doesn't
[1:26:04] want to hey you and your wife or you
[1:26:07] know your spouse there should be no
[1:26:10] secrets between husband and wife amen no
[1:26:13] secrets amen it's the same thing with us
[1:26:16] and God there's no secrets between us
[1:26:17] and him he told us who we are he told us
[1:26:21] where we're from he told us where we're
[1:26:23] going amen he told us who the enemy is
[1:26:26] he told us how he works amen he told us
[1:26:29] a secret to overcome him Hallelujah he
[1:26:32] told us things that the church World
[1:26:34] probes ad and wonders about you have a
[1:26:37] man stand up Christ The Mystery of God
[1:26:38] revealed brother Brandon and apparently
[1:26:41] when he studied that that sermon he had
[1:26:43] his Bible in a concordance when he when
[1:26:44] he put that sermon together and he
[1:26:46] stands up he says now I'm going to tell
[1:26:48] you the secret that God had in the back
[1:26:49] part of his mind before the foundation
[1:26:50] of the
[1:26:51] world Amen it's more than a man more
[1:26:53] than a man declaring things yes I've
[1:26:55] never heard another preacher stand up
[1:26:57] and say I'm going to tell you the
[1:26:58] secrets with the the back part of you
[1:27:00] know back parts of God's mind glor you
[1:27:02] ever heard someone say that here comes a
[1:27:04] man just with the Bible of Concord and
[1:27:06] studies it out oh here's the secrets of
[1:27:08] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:27:09] world wow amen amen hey Glory you talk
[1:27:13] about you talk about a prophet messenger
[1:27:16] amen that stood there and declared what
[1:27:19] God not not what not just what the
[1:27:20] people were thinking but what God was
[1:27:22] thinking amen amen and that whole sermon
[1:27:25] which he speaks he expands about the
[1:27:27] threefold mystery you know that's in the
[1:27:29] seventh C he speaks about God would have
[1:27:31] you know you know and he speaks about
[1:27:33] God having preeminence in the people and
[1:27:34] all these different things he's
[1:27:36] declaring now this is what I want this
[1:27:38] is my
[1:27:39] secret and he's saying this is what this
[1:27:41] is the relationship I want with you that
[1:27:44] become one with you and I would have
[1:27:46] preeminence as the head amen and we'd
[1:27:50] have a perfect
[1:27:51] relationship like there's never been you
[1:27:54] got listen to the
[1:27:56] sermon
[1:27:59] now so we are just to declare now what
[1:28:02] has been given and that's what it means
[1:28:04] why we must prophesy again God as I said
[1:28:07] God always has a living witness and we
[1:28:10] are that witness we are that witness
[1:28:12] that Jesus Christ is alive and well amen
[1:28:15] we are the proof that this message is
[1:28:16] real because it produces the life of the
[1:28:19] scripture in US yes amen
[1:28:22] now it's like brother he says he says
[1:28:25] now he says but you're supposed to live
[1:28:27] your sermons he says Oh how we needed
[1:28:30] Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices
[1:28:33] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:28:36] sweetness and Holiness and Purity
[1:28:38] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:28:40] Earth today without a blemish yes sir
[1:28:43] real Christians that's Thunder against
[1:28:46] the enemy the devil don't care how loud
[1:28:48] you can holler the devil don't care how
[1:28:51] much you can jump how much you can do
[1:28:53] this or Shout but what hurts the devil
[1:28:55] who wants to know what hurts the devil
[1:28:57] yes What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:28:59] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:29:02] say anything to him call him anything
[1:29:04] just as sweet as as it can be and move
[1:29:07] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:29:10] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:29:12] amen amen he says we need thousands of
[1:29:14] lived voices what's that thousands of
[1:29:16] one standing prophesying again what has
[1:29:19] been revealed speaking it living it
[1:29:22] out now
[1:29:24] alas we understand is this I I trust
[1:29:27] you've still got Genesis chapter 24 open
[1:29:29] in
[1:29:30] handy
[1:29:32] now the servant here that that that
[1:29:35] Abraham
[1:29:37] commissions this one that is the elder
[1:29:39] servant he is this he is Alazar of
[1:29:41] Damascus that that that that Abraham
[1:29:44] speaks about Genesis chapter 15 now we
[1:29:47] read here that this this servant was No
[1:29:49] Ordinary
[1:29:50] Servant one he was the head servant but
[1:29:54] two we see that that Abraham tells him
[1:29:56] that God will send his Angel before you
[1:29:59] to prepare to prepare the bride for
[1:30:02] Isaac so you know very few other I've
[1:30:05] never heard of any other servant you
[1:30:07] know in the you in the scripture that
[1:30:10] that the the master says God will send
[1:30:12] not just that I will do something God
[1:30:14] will send his Angel amen before you and
[1:30:17] then number two all the goods of this
[1:30:20] master were given into the given into
[1:30:22] his hands that's why he took the camel
[1:30:24] train all that the father had all that
[1:30:28] Abraham had was placed on these camels
[1:30:30] to to to be taken to get this Bride for
[1:30:33] Isaac amen and so this is incredible
[1:30:37] because now we have to say th so this
[1:30:41] would be the most powerful ministry
[1:30:43] that's ever struck the Earth would be
[1:30:45] represented in this
[1:30:47] man and there's very few incredibly few
[1:30:50] in the scripture that they had the angel
[1:30:52] of God in the
[1:30:54] Ministry amen and there's only one that
[1:30:58] had the very son of man Ministry and
[1:31:01] that is brother brand that's the only
[1:31:03] you know Paul had visitations of angels
[1:31:06] irenius and the early church you know
[1:31:08] Messengers they had visitations of
[1:31:10] angels but very few they did not have
[1:31:13] the son of man Ministry that brother
[1:31:14] brandham had amen here came now cuz God
[1:31:19] you know it's like if you had a business
[1:31:21] just like you take a country if it's
[1:31:23] some Little Country they'll send maybe
[1:31:25] some little Diplomat to go talk to the
[1:31:28] people but if it's someone they really
[1:31:30] want to impress and woo they go
[1:31:32] themselves and they bring the biggest
[1:31:34] gifts and they they lay out the red
[1:31:36] carpet they all do all these things
[1:31:37] because they want to impress them
[1:31:39] because it's an important
[1:31:41] job now the reason Abraham sent such a
[1:31:45] powerful servant is because this was the
[1:31:47] most important job because without a
[1:31:49] bride how can Isaac's line continue how
[1:31:52] can the promised seed
[1:31:54] how can the Redeemer come no he had to
[1:31:57] be married and he had to be married to
[1:31:59] the right kind of woman that's why when
[1:32:01] Abraham said don't take a woman out of
[1:32:03] these Canaanites for my for my son go
[1:32:06] back to my house find a blood relation
[1:32:09] find one that's related to me that has
[1:32:11] the same characteristics as my son
[1:32:13] Hallelujah hey families have the same
[1:32:15] characteristics and that's why I said go
[1:32:17] to my father's house and get and get a
[1:32:19] bride and and we can see that now when
[1:32:22] God found you when God found you he
[1:32:26] wasn't finding someone who wasn't one of
[1:32:28] his children he wasn't finding one who
[1:32:30] wasn't part of the
[1:32:32] family amen he was when he found you see
[1:32:36] this message has come to you to unite
[1:32:38] you with Christ and God is Not haphazard
[1:32:42] at who he gathers all that the father
[1:32:45] has given me will come and all that come
[1:32:48] to me I'll no wise cast out Jesus said
[1:32:50] so he's saying that they've all been
[1:32:51] given but they must come yes and that's
[1:32:54] why this word has been sent your way is
[1:32:56] that God would God would gather you
[1:32:59] because he knew that you were part of
[1:33:01] him amen that's why he said go to my
[1:33:03] father's house to get you know go to the
[1:33:05] land of my Kindred to get Bri uh you
[1:33:08] know Isaac a wife to be family you say
[1:33:11] how could you say well you're talking
[1:33:14] pretty highly of the Bride
[1:33:17] absolutely amen she is the elect Lady of
[1:33:19] all the ages amen that is part of God
[1:33:23] hey species marry
[1:33:26] species That's the Law of God I'm not
[1:33:29] talking about your Humanity friend you
[1:33:31] just put that on the shelf and forget
[1:33:32] about it I'm talking about the real you
[1:33:34] that's that that very thing in you that
[1:33:36] responded said yes I'll go that wasn't
[1:33:39] your feelings or how happy or sad or
[1:33:41] glad whatever you were something in you
[1:33:43] said this is me amen I've heard the
[1:33:45] Master's Call hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:33:47] will go that's that real part of you
[1:33:50] that's been redeemed and so now he and
[1:33:53] so saying well if species marry species
[1:33:57] then you have to be God part of
[1:34:00] God yeah in order to be United with God
[1:34:03] Amen you say that is just too much
[1:34:05] that's not too much Paul said he became
[1:34:09] us in a m in a matter of words he said
[1:34:12] he became me that I might be become him
[1:34:14] by Grace Hallelujah that this flesh man
[1:34:18] would would decrease and the real you
[1:34:20] would come forth yes amen so that's why
[1:34:23] he said now go to my Kindred and get and
[1:34:25] get my my uh my son a wife from there
[1:34:29] and then so this one now he had all the
[1:34:31] goods of the father and that's why you
[1:34:33] see in brother braham's life have you
[1:34:35] had another Ministry that created had
[1:34:38] spoken word creation created squirrel
[1:34:42] spoke Chim out of his wife did all the
[1:34:44] spoke a stor out of existence all these
[1:34:46] different things you won't find it
[1:34:49] what's happened here come all the goods
[1:34:50] of the father coming down because she's
[1:34:53] very important I want to put out a red
[1:34:55] carpet for her amen because she's she's
[1:34:58] the worthy one I've made her worthy
[1:35:00] that's not that you've made yourself
[1:35:02] worthy that's irrelevant hey satan says
[1:35:04] you're not worthy you say who cares I
[1:35:07] don't care your your opinion your
[1:35:09] opinion of yourself doesn't matter his
[1:35:12] opinion doesn't matter God's opinion is
[1:35:14] the only thing that matters you never
[1:35:16] forget this God's opinion of you what
[1:35:20] did he say about me he didn't say you're
[1:35:21] trash and you're up and down and you're
[1:35:23] unstable and you're not even worth it
[1:35:25] that's not what God has said has said
[1:35:29] she is sinless she is perfect in my
[1:35:31] sight she's part of me she is Mrs Jesus
[1:35:35] Christ everything that I've been looking
[1:35:37] for in a woman is in her amen I mean the
[1:35:40] the nature the character amen how she
[1:35:42] conducts herself amen hallelujah Glory
[1:35:45] this is what I've been looking
[1:35:47] for amen yes

[1:35:54] you say devil shut up I don't care amen
[1:35:57] I'm done amen we're done we're through
[1:36:01] amen now so he came down with all the
[1:36:05] goods and
[1:36:07] so Alazar now we'll just read from I
[1:36:11] just want to go from Genesis chapter uh
[1:36:13] 24 I want to go down from verse 7 cuz I
[1:36:16] want to show you in
[1:36:17] this that Rebecca now she's living her
[1:36:21] life when when when alasa
[1:36:24] commission when when Abraham says God
[1:36:27] will send his Angel before you she's
[1:36:29] just living her life she has no idea
[1:36:32] what's going on she does not maybe she
[1:36:36] knows that Abraham you know she has
[1:36:38] distant family and some distant country
[1:36:40] she maybe knows those things but she's
[1:36:42] just living her
[1:36:43] life and then
[1:36:46] so we have this now and the Lord God Of
[1:36:49] Heaven oh we'll just read this again as
[1:36:51] well and the Lord God Of Heaven which
[1:36:52] took me from my father's house and from
[1:36:54] the land of my Kindred and which spoke
[1:36:56] unto me and that swear unto me saying
[1:36:58] unto thy seed will I give this land and
[1:37:00] he shall send his Angel before thee and
[1:37:02] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[1:37:04] th and if the woman will not follow be
[1:37:06] willing to follow thee then Thou shalt
[1:37:08] be clear of this thine oath only bring
[1:37:10] not my son again and the servant put his
[1:37:13] hand this is verse n and his and the
[1:37:15] servant put his hand under the thigh of
[1:37:17] Abraham his master and swear unto him
[1:37:19] concerning that matter and the servant
[1:37:21] took 10 camels of the camels of his
[1:37:23] master and departed for all the goods of
[1:37:25] his master in his hand and he arose and
[1:37:27] went to Mesopotamia and to the uh uh
[1:37:30] city of of uh n and he put his camels to
[1:37:34] kneel down without the City by The Well
[1:37:37] of water at the time of the evening even
[1:37:40] the time that woman were to go out to
[1:37:43] draw water see the timing in the Bible
[1:37:46] is very significant he didn't say in the
[1:37:48] morning time you know I think we s sing
[1:37:50] that song as an ancient you know uh you
[1:37:53] know by H you know Wayside well early in
[1:37:56] the morning it wasn't early in the
[1:37:57] morning it was in the evening it was the
[1:37:59] evening time when this when this servant
[1:38:01] who had everything that the father
[1:38:03] possessed amen you're with him he came
[1:38:06] in the evening to get the bride amen and
[1:38:09] it's in the evening time now when the
[1:38:11] servant that's had the most powerful
[1:38:13] Ministry and record go have a look
[1:38:17] through go through look look through
[1:38:18] history there hasn't been another
[1:38:20] Ministry like this ministry it's in the
[1:38:22] evening time when the father centered
[1:38:24] upon the Earth Amen to find you that's
[1:38:27] why I can say this this is not only you
[1:38:30] know brother Brown's Ministry but it's
[1:38:32] all the ministry 5old ministry under him
[1:38:35] amen has come because we're still a
[1:38:37] living witness we're still a living
[1:38:39] voice
[1:38:40] now and then notice now we're just going
[1:38:42] to read a few more he says he says
[1:38:46] now
[1:38:48] um uh verse 12 and he said oh Lord God
[1:38:51] of my master Abraham I pray the send me
[1:38:54] good speed this day and show kindness
[1:38:55] unto my master Abraham behold I stand
[1:38:58] Here by The Well of water and the
[1:39:00] daughters of the men of the City come
[1:39:01] out to draw water and it came to pass
[1:39:03] that the damsel to whom I shall say let
[1:39:06] uh let down thy picture I pray thee that
[1:39:08] I may drink and she shall say drink and
[1:39:10] I'll give thy camels drink also let the
[1:39:13] same be she that has been appointed for
[1:39:16] thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I
[1:39:19] know that thou showest kindness unto my
[1:39:21] master and it came came to pass before
[1:39:24] he had done speaking that behold Rebecca
[1:39:26] came out which was born of Bethel son of
[1:39:29] um son of uh milka the wife of n
[1:39:32] Abraham's brother and a picture upon her
[1:39:35] shoulder and the damel was very fair to
[1:39:37] look upon a virgin neither had any man
[1:39:39] known her and she went down to the well
[1:39:41] and filled her picture and came up now
[1:39:45] we're just going to leave it there but
[1:39:46] you know he praise this so she's just
[1:39:48] living her
[1:39:50] life and the evening time was when they
[1:39:52] went out and got water she would have
[1:39:54] done that every day y this was just
[1:39:56] everyday living it's like I need to go
[1:39:59] to the supermarket and buy this and
[1:40:00] maybe I do my grocery shop on this day
[1:40:02] that's just everyday living she's going
[1:40:04] down to get water she has no idea that
[1:40:08] there's someone who's who's in her
[1:40:10] presence that has been commissioned by
[1:40:12] the Father Abraham and he's the head
[1:40:14] servant and an angel of God not only
[1:40:17] that the angel of God has already gone
[1:40:18] before to prepare her to receive his
[1:40:22] visitation and so here comes you know
[1:40:24] here comes this and then what happens we
[1:40:26] understand is that she she gives him a
[1:40:28] drink you know you can read the whole
[1:40:30] thing but just to save time she gives
[1:40:32] him a drink and then she says I water
[1:40:33] your camels as well and so he just
[1:40:36] prayed this and now she's living out his
[1:40:39] prayer and she has no idea she has no
[1:40:42] idea what she's doing but she's living
[1:40:44] out the prayer of the servant amen
[1:40:47] hallelujah and then
[1:40:49] so she begins to you know and then where
[1:40:53] up to and then you know she does this
[1:40:56] and then brother Brenham now he tells
[1:41:00] us he tells us that the very if I can
[1:41:04] find
[1:41:06] it he says this in Char us the father in
[1:41:09] 54 he says then Jesus Christ is the same
[1:41:11] yesterday today and forever is that
[1:41:12] right what he did then he can do now is
[1:41:15] that right we love him we believe him

[1:41:20] power tonight that'll take us up in the
[1:41:22] Rapture over I think of that beautiful
[1:41:24] Rebecca that afternoon watering the
[1:41:26] camels watering the very thing that was
[1:41:28] going to take her the bride the water
[1:41:31] that it says the camels represent power
[1:41:33] and the Church of the Living God is
[1:41:35] rejoicing and watering the power of the
[1:41:38] Holy Ghost that'll pick her up someday
[1:41:40] and take her Yonder to meet Isaac in the
[1:41:42] air for the wedding supper he says

[1:41:52] Glory too amen and we and and we pray to
[1:41:55] him we live for that is watering that
[1:41:57] power amen amen that is watering the
[1:41:59] camel amen hallelujah that that thing
[1:42:01] that you're watering and you're
[1:42:03] worshiping am me one day is going to
[1:42:05] pack you from this world into the next
[1:42:06] World amen hallelujah amen so she was
[1:42:10] doing that now she had no
[1:42:12] idea what this guy all she knew is here
[1:42:15] comes a man and he's got camels and he's
[1:42:17] traveled a far
[1:42:18] away and now she is she is literally
[1:42:21] well she was literally watering those
[1:42:24] same beasts that were going to take her
[1:42:26] to her husband but at this stage she
[1:42:29] didn't know about Isaac she had no idea
[1:42:31] about all these things she was just
[1:42:33] living but I want to say she was
[1:42:35] divinely inspired amen amen she was
[1:42:38] being she was anointed with the spirit
[1:42:40] of God she had no idea she wasn't even
[1:42:42] conscious of
[1:42:43] it hey we do things we do things day by
[1:42:47] day we're not even conscious that the
[1:42:50] very life we live is because we're
[1:42:51] anointed by a different Spirit we're
[1:42:54] anointed by almighty God himself amen am
[1:42:56] mean the bride hey we don't just meet
[1:42:58] God when we come in here or when we pray
[1:43:01] God is with us he says I'll never leave
[1:43:02] thee nor forsake thee amen you say I'm
[1:43:05] just you know you just doing going about
[1:43:08] your daily
[1:43:10] business I tell you we are the most
[1:43:12] anointed people amen you may say well
[1:43:15] I'm looking for thunder and lightning
[1:43:16] and all these kind of things look it's
[1:43:19] not it's not
[1:43:21] that it's people people who are what
[1:43:24] makes
[1:43:25] you reject this
[1:43:28] world cuz in the in in in humanity Paul
[1:43:32] said there's not one that seeks after
[1:43:33] God not one he says in the Book of
[1:43:36] Romans so what made you
[1:43:40] turn from going the way you used to went
[1:43:43] and there's something in you even though
[1:43:45] maybe the message never came your way
[1:43:46] but something in you said there must be
[1:43:48] more there must be more to life and even
[1:43:51] the church maybe ear you must thinking
[1:43:52] there must be more to it than this
[1:43:55] what's happening now you're coming under
[1:43:57] an
[1:43:59] influence amen that is not
[1:44:02] you am if we had our way we'd just go
[1:44:04] the way like the West you know rest of
[1:44:06] the world Amen but something something
[1:44:10] in US said there's more to life amen
[1:44:14] that and that and that that hunger did
[1:44:16] not come from you that thirst you didn't
[1:44:19] generate that thirst amen but now you
[1:44:22] alas
[1:44:23] you know the angel of God was sent
[1:44:25] before him and she came under an
[1:44:27] influence she was doing things she had
[1:44:29] no idea really the significance of what
[1:44:31] she was doing and then now when a people
[1:44:33] begin to hunger and thirst maybe sitting
[1:44:35] in some denominational tomb or or just
[1:44:38] out in the world maybe some totally
[1:44:39] different religion but says there must
[1:44:41] be more there must be more What's happen
[1:44:44] they've come under an influence amen
[1:44:47] from that unseen one the almighty God
[1:44:49] himself and it may be years down the
[1:44:51] road when finally the message comes
[1:44:52] their way am but they've been under an
[1:44:54] influence all that time
[1:44:56] Hallelujah am mean you say I just
[1:44:58] stumbled around no you didn't God
[1:45:01] directed your steps God knew when you
[1:45:03] would receive it God knew when you'd say
[1:45:05] I'll go am and God Was preparing you for
[1:45:08] that moment hey Rebecca it wasn't the
[1:45:11] first time that she would have taken Jes
[1:45:13] to the well to fill up and all this
[1:45:15] stuff she' done that every day i' say
[1:45:17] look honey the sun's gone down I'll go
[1:45:18] get the water now just what she did amen
[1:45:21] she was prepared
[1:45:23] before alaz you even arrive amen
[1:45:26] hallelujah and here you
[1:45:28] are I tell you you prepared for this
[1:45:31] amen you're built for this You're Made
[1:45:33] for This amen hallelujah Glory so
[1:45:40] now here he
[1:45:44] comes you know here he comes
[1:45:49] and I'm just trying to
[1:45:53] so the Lord now so the so this Angel who
[1:45:55] went before him he could have you know
[1:45:58] Eleazar could have said God went before
[1:46:01] me now some people ask a question now is
[1:46:04] Jesus here or is he coming and I can say
[1:46:08] he is here amen but then he's also
[1:46:10] coming because he is coming because
[1:46:13] we're still in these bodies we haven't
[1:46:14] been transformed we haven't been caught
[1:46:17] up the dead Christ hasn't raised you
[1:46:18] know first so so the end of his coming
[1:46:21] his coming hasn't been completed in that
[1:46:23] sense but I can say in a sense he's very
[1:46:25] much here amen and I can say that
[1:46:30] because one we have read Revelations 10
[1:46:34] and the M Angel descendant and brother
[1:46:36] Ram said that the seventh angel is on
[1:46:38] the time of the Earth at the time of
[1:46:39] that coming you you hear about it in the
[1:46:42] breach so that's Christ descending so we
[1:46:44] can say he's here and then also I can
[1:46:46] say he's here because the Centurion you
[1:46:49] you going reading the scripture the
[1:46:50] Centurion that came to Jesus had a six
[1:46:52] servant who knows the story y he had a
[1:46:55] revelation he said you know others
[1:46:59] others like Jas who had the daughter
[1:47:00] that was sick they said come and lay
[1:47:03] hands and pray but this Centurion had a
[1:47:06] revelation that Jesus himself didn't
[1:47:09] need to go he says I'm not worthy that
[1:47:11] you should come under my roof but just
[1:47:13] speak the word because I'm a man out you
[1:47:15] know of authority and I say do this and
[1:47:17] people do this and you know and and he
[1:47:19] recognized the same thing in Jesus and
[1:47:21] so he said just speak the word word and
[1:47:23] she'll be well so he had the Revelation
[1:47:26] that him speaking the word was exactly
[1:47:29] the same as him self stepping into the
[1:47:32] house amen he had that he had that
[1:47:34] Revelation and I can say God's word is
[1:47:37] here amen the the full revelation of God
[1:47:40] which is Jesus Christ it his completion
[1:47:43] is present Among Us amen that God
[1:47:45] himself is here his word is here
[1:47:48] therefore he is here because him and his
[1:47:50] word is the same thing yes oh I want to
[1:47:53] see Jesus Jesus is present yeah amen
[1:47:55] Jesus Walks among us hallelujah and we
[1:47:59] as I said you the body change hasn't
[1:48:01] happened yet but I say he has come amen
[1:48:04] but he's coming you understand but the
[1:48:07] Centurion knew just speak the word
[1:48:09] because his word was the same as himself
[1:48:11] bodily
[1:48:12] going and God has sent his word
[1:48:15] hallelujah amen amen hey I think that's
[1:48:17] you know we should rejoice in that I
[1:48:19] need more of him he's already here
[1:48:21] everything he needs to of you is already
[1:48:23] present yes sir amen we don't need to I
[1:48:25] I want to see him one day you're seeing
[1:48:27] him now amen you seeing manifest himself
[1:48:31] now
[1:48:32] hallelujah amen so now this
[1:48:35] elazer he he comes down and then we'll
[1:48:37] just read
[1:48:39] from um let's just drop down now to
[1:48:43] verse 20 and she hastened and emptied
[1:48:45] her picture into the trough and ran
[1:48:47] again to the well to draw water and Drew
[1:48:49] it for all his camels and the man
[1:48:51] wondered at her and held his peace to it
[1:48:53] whether the Lord had made his journey
[1:48:55] prosperous or not so she's living out
[1:48:57] his prayer and it came to pass as the
[1:49:00] camels had done drinking that the man
[1:49:02] took a golden earring of half the shle
[1:49:04] weight and two bracelets for her hands
[1:49:07] of 10 shkel weight of gold and said
[1:49:09] whose daughter art thou tell me I pray
[1:49:11] thee is there room in thy father's house
[1:49:13] for us to Lodge in and she said unto him
[1:49:15] I am the daughter of Bethel the son of
[1:49:19] of milka which she bear unto n and she
[1:49:22] said over unto him we have both straw
[1:49:24] and provender enough and room to Lodge
[1:49:27] in and the man bowed down his head and
[1:49:30] Worship the Lord and said blessed be the
[1:49:33] Lord God of my master Abraham who hath
[1:49:35] not left destitute my master of his
[1:49:38] mercy and his truth and I being in the
[1:49:40] way the Lord led me to the house of my
[1:49:42] Master's Brethren now you say well what
[1:49:45] what's this about
[1:49:46] jewelry we read later on that Jacob
[1:49:49] tells his wives in these things take off
[1:49:51] the Rings out of your ears put away your
[1:49:53] strange Gods because we're going to go
[1:49:54] meet the Lord this is in
[1:49:57] Genesis
[1:49:59] um where are we this is later on this is
[1:50:02] in Genesis now 35 you read it and so now
[1:50:06] what happens is this is symbolic now
[1:50:09] that the head servant is giving gifts to
[1:50:12] the
[1:50:13] bride what is gold
[1:50:16] deity what what is the ear hearing the
[1:50:18] word anointed to hear the word what's
[1:50:20] the braces on the hands The Works of her
[1:50:23] hands her service has been anointed amen
[1:50:27] and she had already done the service and
[1:50:28] she had no idea what she was doing by
[1:50:29] watering the camels Hallelujah so now
[1:50:33] because remember all of the father all
[1:50:34] of the father's house all of his
[1:50:36] possessions were given to the servant
[1:50:38] and he distributed it now and he gave
[1:50:41] what Rebecca needed and then now they go
[1:50:44] and I'm not going to read the whole
[1:50:45] thing but what happens now is is as
[1:50:49] Rebecca and alaz now they go back into
[1:50:51] her father's house alaza begins to speak
[1:50:55] to to her Kindred she doesn't know the
[1:50:58] she has no idea at this point she has no
[1:51:00] idea about Isaac she has no idea about
[1:51:03] the angel of the Lord amen amen she just
[1:51:07] watered this you know she just ordered
[1:51:09] this guy's camels gave him a drink found
[1:51:11] out that they you know his his master's
[1:51:14] related and then now she goes you know
[1:51:16] they go into the um her her father's
[1:51:19] house and then he sits down and begins
[1:51:21] to relate what we read there in the
[1:51:23] start of the chapter that Abraham is
[1:51:26] blessed you know above all things that
[1:51:28] he has a son called Isaac that I've been
[1:51:31] sent by my master to find Isaac a wife
[1:51:35] and and he told me to go to go to his
[1:51:38] Kindred so it wasn't just any woman but
[1:51:40] a specific woman I had to come find and
[1:51:42] now I have come to the well and Abraham
[1:51:44] said the angel of the Lord would go
[1:51:46] before me to prepare the way and then
[1:51:50] and then he said now and then I came
[1:51:52] here at the evening time just you know
[1:51:54] just a few minutes ago and I prayed that
[1:51:58] God would send that that bride right
[1:52:00] into my presence by the well and she's
[1:52:03] standing there she has never heard these
[1:52:05] things before but she is she begins to
[1:52:07] realize all of this that she had an idea
[1:52:10] about all this unseen going on hey all
[1:52:13] she knows is a guy some camels and and
[1:52:15] and and he's a servant that's all she
[1:52:17] knows initially but then the servant
[1:52:19] begins to testify to her father's house
[1:52:21] all these things and then she begins to
[1:52:25] realize everything he has done the very
[1:52:28] reason that he was sent the very prayer
[1:52:32] that he even prayed I know I had no
[1:52:33] idear he prayed these things I've just
[1:52:36] lived it out amen amen
[1:52:40] now I'm sure she begin to recognize the
[1:52:43] very reason I live these things out is
[1:52:46] because I'm the bride for
[1:52:47] Isaac
[1:52:49] Hallelujah and I don't know how how how
[1:52:52] much it's anchored into your soul but
[1:52:54] the very reason you responded to the
[1:52:56] word and you gave yourself to him and
[1:52:59] you repented and got baptized and you
[1:53:01] came forth a newness of life now a
[1:53:03] different life is living out of you as
[1:53:06] you did all that maybe not even fully
[1:53:08] understanding what was going on you came
[1:53:10] under an influence amen and all other
[1:53:12] religion just vanished all other life
[1:53:15] just vanished and things maybe you once
[1:53:16] did they just vanished and you gave
[1:53:18] yourself to this you know initially
[1:53:21] maybe you had no idea I've been I've
[1:53:24] been ordained I've been predestinated to
[1:53:27] be to be married Amen to the promised
[1:53:30] son hallelujah amen amen and then so she
[1:53:33] would have recognized he's talking about
[1:53:36] me
[1:53:37] Hallelujah the the Crux of the story
[1:53:40] changes from the from the servant now
[1:53:43] I'd say from the prophet to the prophecy
[1:53:46] here's the woman comes into view
[1:53:50] glory and now they begin to talk now and
[1:53:55] the father's house you know he gives
[1:53:59] them gifts as well and and you can read
[1:54:01] about in this you know in the in the
[1:54:03] story he you know he gives them gifts as
[1:54:06] well and then they try and delay they
[1:54:09] try and delay them
[1:54:10] leaving and they say well just stay for
[1:54:13] stay for a few more days you know he
[1:54:15] says this is verse 55 and her brother
[1:54:17] and her mother said let the damsel abide
[1:54:19] with us a few days at the least 10 uh
[1:54:22] after that she shall go so there comes
[1:54:26] so there Comes A Time now so what
[1:54:28] happens is brother Braham that Elijah
[1:54:30] Ministry sent into the Earth and goes
[1:54:32] amongst the Pentecostal people and a
[1:54:35] great anointing falls upon not only
[1:54:37] North America but all over the world
[1:54:39] Divine Healing and all these things you
[1:54:41] know you hear I think it's like Gordon
[1:54:43] Lindsay's testimony or I think it's ER
[1:54:45] ba I might be wrong but they said before
[1:54:47] brother Brown's Ministry Came Upon the
[1:54:48] scene the Pentecostal move was at its
[1:54:51] lowest e it had basically virtually
[1:54:54] ceased to be and then now God sends this
[1:54:57] kind of ministry and and an anointing is
[1:54:59] p Just ped out everywhere What's
[1:55:02] Happening Here Comes the chief servant
[1:55:05] and gifts are given to churches and
[1:55:08] people are in
[1:55:09] Revival and all this was done now is
[1:55:12] because Rebecca was in those churches
[1:55:15] hey I know people even sitting here
[1:55:17] their churches were blessed
[1:55:19] denominational churches were blessed
[1:55:22] because because they were in that church
[1:55:24] amen gifts were sent into that church
[1:55:26] things were sent into that church
[1:55:28] because Rebecca was still there amen how
[1:55:31] you take Isaac and Shannon and all you
[1:55:32] know all these ones you know you hear
[1:55:34] their testimony about being at w these
[1:55:38] kind of churches why cuz they were
[1:55:41] there amen and there's others like up in
[1:55:44] taneki they in churches in in New
[1:55:46] Zealand and the church was blessed and
[1:55:48] they being young you know the eldest
[1:55:50] thought that these ones will carry the
[1:55:52] Church on then they receive the message
[1:55:54] and they pull out of the church and the
[1:55:55] church dies yes sir that's right why
[1:55:58] because Rebecca's
[1:56:00] there Rebecca's in the place and gifts
[1:56:02] are being given amen but then they had
[1:56:05] to and then you see they you know her
[1:56:08] her family didn't want her to leave cuz
[1:56:09] they're being
[1:56:11] blessed amen they were being blessed
[1:56:13] because she and the messenger were there
[1:56:15] but then as like any faithful messenger
[1:56:18] he does what he's told as quickly as he
[1:56:20] can and then he you know and then he
[1:56:21] fulfills Mission then he moves on
[1:56:23] Hallelujah and he said now he says
[1:56:25] hinder me not seeing the Lord has
[1:56:28] prospered my way send me a way that I
[1:56:30] may go to my master he said he says I'm
[1:56:32] not here for a holiday I'm not here to
[1:56:34] build some some some denominational
[1:56:37] church or some Empire to myself I just
[1:56:39] want to do what I meant to do and then
[1:56:41] move on Amen and you can see that with
[1:56:43] brother bram's life he had a he had a
[1:56:45] caravan with a typewriter that was his
[1:56:47] office old Roberts and all these ones
[1:56:49] had millions of dollars worth of
[1:56:50] buildings he speaks about it he's a man
[1:56:53] with a little you know people said have
[1:56:55] you seen brandom Tabernacle I'm sure
[1:56:56] you've seen pictures of it you know when
[1:56:59] they first built that people said we're
[1:57:00] going to turn that into a garage it's
[1:57:02] not some great big steeple some great
[1:57:04] big thing just it's just a brick
[1:57:06] building yeah and here was a
[1:57:09] place God came down God revealed things
[1:57:12] that had never been spoken they were in
[1:57:14] the scripture but had never been
[1:57:15] revealed before Hallelujah in this
[1:57:17] little building why is that he didn't
[1:57:19] want some Empire for himself amen amen
[1:57:22] we're not interested in building big
[1:57:23] things Hallelujah find the bride and get
[1:57:25] out that's why we're here and the sooner
[1:57:28] we find her the sooner we leave amen and
[1:57:31] the sooner we all come to our position
[1:57:33] we leave amen so don't sit back just say
[1:57:35] I'll go amen hallelujah that's all you
[1:57:38] need to do and they said we will call
[1:57:40] the damsel and inquire it out her mouth
[1:57:43] see this is why the the power for her to
[1:57:45] leave was in her power amen you say well
[1:57:48] the devil's got me down or I can't you
[1:57:50] know it's in your power that's right
[1:57:53] amen when you say when you when you
[1:57:54] begin to hate the thing that has held
[1:57:56] you back when you begin to hate the
[1:57:58] thing that Wars with you you must hate
[1:58:01] it if you worship it you'll never be
[1:58:03] free but if you hate it you'll be free
[1:58:05] you must hate the enemy and hate his
[1:58:07] works against you and when you come to
[1:58:09] that point then you say oh go then it
[1:58:12] must let then it must let go am mean
[1:58:15] you've got to hate it Hallelujah and so
[1:58:18] then she says and they called Rebecca
[1:58:21] and they said unto to her will we go
[1:58:23] with uh will thou God this man she said
[1:58:25] I'll go and they sent away Rebecca their
[1:58:29] sister and her nurse and Abraham's
[1:58:30] servant and his men and so her decision
[1:58:34] caused her to leave and go to the one
[1:58:35] she's meant to be married to now notice
[1:58:38] this and they said they blessed Rebecca
[1:58:39] and said unto her Thou Art our sister
[1:58:41] and thou sh be thou the mother of
[1:58:44] thousands and millions and thy seed
[1:58:47] shall possess the gates of those which
[1:58:50] hate them yes now this same bless fell
[1:58:52] upon
[1:58:53] Abraham and they had no idea they were
[1:58:56] prophesying when they were blessing
[1:58:57] Rebecca they were prophesying speaking
[1:59:00] over her things that they were not even
[1:59:01] aware what they were doing and because
[1:59:04] this blessing Came Upon Abraham that his
[1:59:06] seed shall possess against the enemy and
[1:59:09] therefore that same blessing was passed
[1:59:10] down to Isaac so the one that was to be
[1:59:13] United with Isaac had to have that same
[1:59:16] blessing amen hallelujah that her seed
[1:59:19] amen will possess the gates of the enemy
[1:59:22] amen she had no idea that was in her
[1:59:25] that was spoken over her because it was
[1:59:27] in her amen hallelujah glory and now so
[1:59:32] the man and the woman have the same
[1:59:33] blessing put upon them Hallelujah you go
[1:59:37] read about Abraham the same blessing
[1:59:39] falls upon Abraham therefore it's upon
[1:59:41] Isaac cuz he's the son amen and then now
[1:59:46] remember Isaac's Christ and Rebecca's
[1:59:48] you and you say well Jesus conquered
[1:59:51] everything because the seed will possess
[1:59:53] the gates of the enemy and it did and it
[1:59:56] does hallelujah and and that was you
[1:59:59] know Jesus conquered every Dimension
[2:00:00] that could be conquered he conquered
[2:00:02] every enemy that could be conquered amen
[2:00:04] he is the boss he defeated everything
[2:00:07] and we say how glorious that is and it
[2:00:09] is glorious but then we must recognize
[2:00:11] now if that applies to him it applies to
[2:00:14] you because the seed thy seed shall
[2:00:17] possess the gates of the enemy
[2:00:19] Hallelujah so now the woman that's why
[2:00:21] we can say we can do all things through
[2:00:23] Christ which strengthens me that means
[2:00:26] you can defeat possess every gate of the
[2:00:29] enemy amen you can you know when you
[2:00:31] possess a doorway no one else can get
[2:00:33] through that
[2:00:34] doorway amen if you're big enough no
[2:00:38] one's getting through the door if you
[2:00:39] say
[2:00:40] no that what it means to possess the
[2:00:42] gate so now that means now that whatever
[2:00:45] is wanting to get through can't go
[2:00:47] through amen hallelujah and so now if
[2:00:51] God is saying that you will possess
[2:00:53] because Christ is the seed of the
[2:00:55] promise but we're part of himen so every
[2:00:57] blessing that fell upon him because
[2:00:59] we're United with him falls upon us
[2:01:02] hallelujah and even because this
[2:01:03] blessing she hadn't become one with
[2:01:05] Isaac yet am mean she was ordained to
[2:01:08] become one with him all the blessings
[2:01:10] that fell upon him were already upon him
[2:01:13] she just had to recognize it and now
[2:01:15] she's caught up in this big Vortex of
[2:01:17] Prophecy and now the word comes your way
[2:01:21] Hallelujah
[2:01:22] and you hear about Jesus the name above
[2:01:24] all names and everything must bow to his
[2:01:26] name and he conquered everything amen
[2:01:29] and just to prove that he conquered
[2:01:30] everything he has you know he has proven
[2:01:33] it in the lives of Believers am mean
[2:01:36] where smoking or lust or some addiction
[2:01:37] or just the world or some religion or
[2:01:39] denomination or something and that's
[2:01:41] been put under their feet and that is a
[2:01:44] proof now that Jesus is the name above
[2:01:46] all names amen that he defeated Satan
[2:01:49] and that defeat is just as real then as
[2:01:52] it is now amen and so that blessing has
[2:01:54] fallen upon
[2:01:56] you that you can possess you shall amen
[2:02:00] he says I just want to read that
[2:02:03] again and let thy seed possess the gates
[2:02:07] of
[2:02:08] them uh of those which hate them so he
[2:02:11] says it's going to happen I think
[2:02:13] Abraham says Thou shalt possess thy seed
[2:02:15] shall possess against the enemy so it's
[2:02:17] going to be that way so every way the
[2:02:19] enemy can come against you you shall
[2:02:22] possess that gate amen amen if it's in
[2:02:24] your conscience if it's in your
[2:02:25] reasoning if it's in your affections if
[2:02:27] it's in your memory if it's in your
[2:02:30] imagination if it's in the things you
[2:02:33] see the things you hear the things you
[2:02:35] feel amen I thought it be some big fancy
[2:02:39] thing no you're possessed remember this
[2:02:42] this thing is to contact this world Amen
[2:02:45] and the same thing with our spiritual
[2:02:47] you know how we feel our feelings our
[2:02:49] imaginations all these things that is to
[2:02:51] really contact these kind of things
[2:02:54] faith is to contact God and the devil
[2:02:56] can't get to your soul but he'll get to
[2:02:58] your body and if he can't get to your
[2:02:59] body you'll anoint your spirit and make
[2:03:01] you feel down and do all these kind of
[2:03:02] things but you shall possess that gate
[2:03:05] amen God says you shall possess that
[2:03:07] gate Hallelujah so whenever the enemy
[2:03:09] comes against you you say
[2:03:11] no it's written thus sayith the Lord
[2:03:15] amen the seed I am the seed I'm part of
[2:03:18] the promise I shall possess the Gate of
[2:03:20] the enemy amen Hallelujah he conquered
[2:03:23] everything and now he's living that
[2:03:24] Victory out in
[2:03:26] you
[2:03:28] glory amen so they came under that same
[2:03:31] blessing you know you can just see how
[2:03:33] much the Believers are blessed in the
[2:03:35] scripture amen when when when balum is
[2:03:38] is taken by by Moab you know the king of
[2:03:41] Moab and balam you know the king of Moab
[2:03:43] says curse curse Israel cuz he's seen
[2:03:46] that fighting a natural war against
[2:03:48] Israel doesn't work go read numbers
[2:03:50] 22-25
[2:03:52] and so the spirit of God comes upon
[2:03:54] balum and he and he tries to curse
[2:03:57] Israel and three times He blesses Israel
[2:04:01] and one time when the spirit of God
[2:04:02] comes upon me God is speaking now God
[2:04:05] speaking first person through a man and
[2:04:07] he says I behold no iniquity in
[2:04:10] Jacob amen and the king of Moab said
[2:04:13] come and look at the hinder parts of
[2:04:15] Israel Tak him to different places to
[2:04:17] see that you know the hinder parts are
[2:04:18] the bad bits and the people you know
[2:04:21] maybe the struggles in the camp and the
[2:04:23] sin in the camp and all these different
[2:04:24] things and God actually declares now I'm
[2:04:26] not condoning sin but you understand
[2:04:28] what I'm saying when God looks down to
[2:04:29] Israel he says I see no iniquity in
[2:04:33] Jacob Hallelujah when he looks at you
[2:04:37] when he looks at you he says I see no
[2:04:39] iniquity in my bride amen he says I
[2:04:42] don't even see it or the one that can
[2:04:44] see all things here and he's not just
[2:04:46] twisting the truth he says I see no
[2:04:47] iniquity because he's come under a
[2:04:49] covenant amen amen a blood
[2:04:52] Hallelujah that when when when God sees
[2:04:54] you he sees the blood he sees that life
[2:04:57] on display and if he sees that life he
[2:04:59] doesn't see your old ways he doesn't see
[2:05:01] your iniquity how I fail every day
[2:05:03] that's why God provided a lamb amen and
[2:05:06] the more we walk in this world the more
[2:05:08] we realize we needed a lamb and not just
[2:05:11] to save us but to keep us amen that we
[2:05:13] can still stand in this evil day hey we
[2:05:16] needed a lamb and God has provided
[2:05:18] himself a lamb Hallelujah say I'm
[2:05:22] wrestling with something just keep hey
[2:05:24] just give it to him it won't let go of
[2:05:26] me one day it will possess it like it
[2:05:29] already is is you already have the
[2:05:30] victory amen amen hey the battle the
[2:05:33] battle is the Lord sometimes the battle
[2:05:35] takes a while amen but don't give up
[2:05:39] just cuz the devil keeps maybe you know
[2:05:41] Paul said that uh you know your your
[2:05:44] enemy was buffering him and he besought
[2:05:46] the Lord three times he didn't suddenly
[2:05:49] quit and say I'm not an apostle anymore
[2:05:50] this is not going to work out up amen
[2:05:53] and the Lord said to him I give I've
[2:05:55] given you my grace is sufficient for
[2:05:57] thee now some things it's like that but
[2:06:00] some things the devil must let go and
[2:06:03] he's done make sure you know which one
[2:06:04] it
[2:06:05] is they say well I fell get back up the
[2:06:08] scripture tells us it's not him that
[2:06:10] falls it's him that gets back up amen
[2:06:12] that is the one amen hey a you know
[2:06:15] someone who's Victorious doesn't stay
[2:06:17] their face in the mud they get back up
[2:06:19] they say Lord try me one more time I've
[2:06:21] done it so many times that's why we have
[2:06:23] a
[2:06:24] lamb Hallelujah that's why God provided
[2:06:26] himself a lamb that's right you say well
[2:06:29] I keep doing things you know I have I
[2:06:32] have iniquity in my life he was wounded
[2:06:34] for our transgressions he was bruised
[2:06:37] for our
[2:06:39] iniquities Hallelujah God knew you'd
[2:06:42] have them don't own them like they're
[2:06:44] part of you and that's just how it is
[2:06:46] don't put up with it that's right what
[2:06:48] it's done just watch the victory unfold
[2:06:51] amen hallelujah
[2:06:54] amen now she says I'll go and they begin
[2:06:58] to
[2:07:00] leave and Rebecca arose and her damsels
[2:07:03] and they rode upon the camels and they
[2:07:05] followed the man and the servant took
[2:07:07] Rebecca and went his
[2:07:09] way now and Isaac came from the way of
[2:07:13] The Well
[2:07:15] of uh
[2:07:17] lari uh for he dwelleth in the South
[2:07:20] Country and that name actually means The
[2:07:22] Well of him that liveth and seeth me and
[2:07:25] Isaac went out to meditate in the field
[2:07:27] at the even tide so in the evening time
[2:07:30] now there's a uniting going on Amen
[2:07:33] Hallelujah in the evening time at the
[2:07:35] even
[2:07:36] tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw
[2:07:39] and behold the camels were coming so
[2:07:41] notice now Isaac is not in in in his
[2:07:44] father's house or where his tents are
[2:07:47] but he's come to me he's he he's
[2:07:48] Advanced now from where his family
[2:07:51] living he's Advanced now towards now the
[2:07:53] bride is coming so they meet halfway
[2:07:57] between between his father's house and
[2:08:01] from where you know your Rebecca and and
[2:08:03] alasar are coming so so he's Advanced
[2:08:06] now that's why I say heaven has expanded
[2:08:09] I mean God has come down he's Advanced
[2:08:12] from Glory he's coming down to the Earth
[2:08:15] amen because Isaac now Advanced he
[2:08:17] wasn't staying in his mother's tent
[2:08:18] waiting for the camels to come there but
[2:08:20] he came out into the field at the
[2:08:21] evening time he Advanced towards where
[2:08:24] they were
[2:08:25] coming amen God is closer than your next
[2:08:28] breath I just say it that much God is
[2:08:31] closer than your next breath doesn't
[2:08:33] matter how you feel what you think about
[2:08:34] it God is closer than your next breath
[2:08:38] Hallelujah and he saw the camels coming
[2:08:40] and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and then
[2:08:42] and when she saw Isaac she lighted off
[2:08:44] the camel hallelujah amen and she had
[2:08:48] for she had said unto the servant what
[2:08:51] man is is this that walketh in the field
[2:08:54] to meet
[2:08:55] us and the servant said it is my master
[2:08:58] and therefore she took a veil and
[2:08:59] covered herself so when she saw Isaac
[2:09:02] she said what man is this that walketh
[2:09:05] towards us and we can pose you I can
[2:09:07] pose the same question to you what man
[2:09:10] is this amen what man is this that is
[2:09:13] the Unseen one hallelujah amen that that
[2:09:15] is advancing towards us that walks Among
[2:09:18] Us amen that heals us when we're sick
[2:09:20] that Comfort us when we're when we're
[2:09:21] broken that lifts us up amen that comes
[2:09:24] and dwells in us what man is this me
[2:09:27] what man is this that has stirred our
[2:09:28] hearts Hallelujah that we don't just
[2:09:30] have a church but we want to go on a
[2:09:31] Rapture I mean we want to see his word
[2:09:33] be fulfilled what man is this I mean
[2:09:36] what man is this that has that has saved
[2:09:38] our Liv and mean the people have come
[2:09:40] into the church they've met they've met
[2:09:42] the Living God what man is this
[2:09:45] Hallelujah friends if we could recognize
[2:09:46] what God does among us daily amen that
[2:09:49] we're kept by the power of the Holy
[2:09:51] Ghost
[2:09:52] Hallelujah that we have an expectation
[2:09:54] for a catching away you didn't put that
[2:09:56] there God put that there hallelujah what
[2:09:59] man is
[2:10:00] this Hallelujah it is my master
[2:10:04] therefore she took a veil and covered
[2:10:05] herself now the veil it's like when a
[2:10:08] woman comes down the aisle traditionally
[2:10:10] she has veiled and that is representing
[2:10:12] now that this man that is standing at
[2:10:13] the end of the aisle has become her head
[2:10:16] amen that she has no thought coming but
[2:10:18] she's coming under his headship that's
[2:10:20] why Rebecca herself and so now this also
[2:10:24] signifies that everything because in the
[2:10:26] Eastern Traditions the Jewish Traditions
[2:10:29] the woman wouldn't just take off her
[2:10:31] veil but she would remove the veil and
[2:10:33] put it on his right shoulder signifying
[2:10:37] that every all of her care all of her
[2:10:39] needs are going to come through that man
[2:10:42] and that's why when when Isaiah would
[2:10:44] speak about he says unto us a son is
[2:10:46] born a child is given and his name Shall
[2:10:48] be Called wonderful and counselor and
[2:10:50] the Everlasting father the Mighty God
[2:10:52] and the government shall be upon his
[2:10:54] shoulder the scripture tells us you go
[2:10:56] read Isaiah 9 and so he saying now that
[2:10:58] all her cares all her needs are placed
[2:11:01] upon his shoulder amen amen the
[2:11:03] scripture tells us cast all your cares
[2:11:05] upon Him for he carth for you amen he
[2:11:10] car you know just just give it to him
[2:11:12] hey he's got some strong shoulders
[2:11:14] there's no burden hey he he walked up
[2:11:17] Calvary with your with the sin of the
[2:11:18] world upon him and you have some need
[2:11:21] I'm not belittling the neede but he
[2:11:23] knows what it's like to pack a burden he
[2:11:25] knows what it's like to take
[2:11:27] responsibility Hallelujah when he said
[2:11:28] for this cause I've come into the world
[2:11:30] and that cause was I'm going to redeem
[2:11:32] my wife amen I'm going to take her shame
[2:11:35] and her sin and her unbelief upon myself
[2:11:39] Hallelujah and I'm going to take it and
[2:11:40] place it where it should be glory amen
[2:11:43] he took it upon his shoulder amen that's
[2:11:46] why just cast your cars upon him for he
[2:11:48] careth for you Hallelujah put it upon
[2:11:50] his
[2:11:51] shoulder and the servant took Isaac and
[2:11:54] all oh sorry and the servant told
[2:11:57] Isaac all the things that he had done
[2:12:01] hallelujah and Isaac brought her into
[2:12:03] her mother's into her mother Sarah's
[2:12:05] tent and took Rebecca and she became his
[2:12:08] wife and he loved her and Isaac was
[2:12:10] comforted after his mother's death that
[2:12:13] same tent when Elohim came down and
[2:12:16] discerned her thoughts and said to her
[2:12:18] according to time of life you're going
[2:12:19] to have the promised son that
[2:12:21] tent amen that same
[2:12:24] place that's why the Lord comes now and
[2:12:27] we're United here amen we know we're
[2:12:31] going to because we're going to the
[2:12:32] marriage supper not to the marriage amen
[2:12:35] you we are united with him present here
[2:12:38] upon this Earth that's why they
[2:12:40] consumated the marriage now in the
[2:12:43] tent amen here this tent your your
[2:12:47] Dwelling Place amen he he unites himself
[2:12:50] with you here hallelujah amen amen so
[2:12:54] now this this whole
[2:12:57] scene is where we are in the end time
[2:13:00] this is the most important
[2:13:03] thing that God would take God would take
[2:13:06] a
[2:13:07] woman now brother says in a super
[2:13:11] sign he says now when the light stuck
[2:13:14] little Rebecca she knew something she
[2:13:16] knew something within her that had
[2:13:18] brought her to Isaac she veiled her face
[2:13:20] she wanted had no more to do with her
[2:13:22] own thinking Isaac was her thinking from
[2:13:24] then on and the church itself when it
[2:13:27] strikes that power of God the baptism of
[2:13:29] the Holy Ghost out of the denominational
[2:13:32] churches out of the Catholic Church
[2:13:33] wherever it is when that baptism of the
[2:13:36] Holy Ghost is made real to people then
[2:13:39] that's
[2:13:40] predestinated uh like you people here to
[2:13:42] eternal life sees it and walks in it
[2:13:45] what is it he says a super sign it's a
[2:13:47] sign to the end time amen you want to
[2:13:51] see where we are in the end time I'm
[2:13:53] going to go into all those other things
[2:13:54] but I wanted to put because this is the
[2:13:56] most important thing cuz all the world
[2:13:58] is looking at Russia and all the world
[2:13:59] is looking at blood moons and all the
[2:14:01] world is looking at all these other
[2:14:02] things but they are
[2:14:04] overlooking the most important thing
[2:14:07] what is that most important thing a
[2:14:09] woman has heard a message and she said
[2:14:12] I'll
[2:14:13] go hallelujah amen a bride has been
[2:14:17] prepared for Isaac and she said I will
[2:14:20] go and now she's on her way off this
[2:14:24] Earth Hallelujah you know part of you is

[2:14:33] caught up now your body just has to
[2:14:35] catch up amen amen part of you is
[2:14:37] already that's why the Rapture is for
[2:14:39] the raptured those who are caught up
[2:14:41] with God that's who the Rapture is for
[2:14:43] amen
[2:14:45] hallelujah amen we are we are the sign
[2:14:48] of the End Amen we are the sign of the
[2:14:50] end am you know you just read like
[2:14:52] Abraham's life as Abraham and he's
[2:14:55] called out and during that time cities
[2:14:58] are being built people are inventing new
[2:15:01] things nations are rising nations are
[2:15:04] falling Wars are being fought you know
[2:15:07] all the Sodom Gomorrah conditions are
[2:15:09] coming into
[2:15:10] place there's very little of it
[2:15:14] recorded you know there's only the book
[2:15:16] where lot's taking captive and all these
[2:15:17] different things but all this over the
[2:15:19] entire Earth all these things are going
[2:15:21] on in world
[2:15:23] history it's not in here because it's
[2:15:25] not important to God Abraham was
[2:15:28] important to God that's why his life in
[2:15:30] that part of time is recorded you
[2:15:32] following me God's eyes are upon Abraham
[2:15:35] and what Abraham was doing and when he'd
[2:15:37] received the promised son that's what
[2:15:39] God was looking at in that whole season
[2:15:42] and here you are and people are you know
[2:15:45] this social media all these this is
[2:15:47] happening this is happening this is
[2:15:48] happening all these things are happening
[2:15:49] God doesn't care he knows it's going to
[2:15:52] happen but that's not his Focus amen now
[2:15:55] the reason I say this say what are you
[2:15:56] looking
[2:15:57] at amen if hey if something's important
[2:16:00] to God we should look at what God is
[2:16:02] interested in amen amen amen now I don't
[2:16:05] mean become some ined n in some Hilltop
[2:16:08] Monastery someplace you know what I mean

[2:16:16] with Isaac amen I'm watering the camels
