[37:28] Corinthians I can driw second
[37:29] Corinthians 13 and 3 and 17 sorry I'll
[37:33] get there
[37:34] eventually we're going to get through
[37:36] the
[37:37] service amen so let's just read here a
[37:40] couple of Scriptures it says now the
[37:42] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[37:45] of the Lord is there is Liberty but we
[37:48] all with open face beholding as in a
[37:50] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[37:53] into the same image from glory to glory
[37:56] even as by the spirit of the Lord amen
[37:59] amen so we're we're going through a
[38:02] transformation amen amen so let's bow
[38:04] our heads in a word of prayer this
[38:05] morning amen gracious Heavenly Father we
[38:08] just want to thank you so much we can
[38:10] truly say that you are our God and you
[38:12] are the same yesterday today and forever
[38:14] and we are so thankful that we have
[38:17] something to tell Lord that more than
[38:19] just of an account of a historical God
[38:22] but you are alive you are the present
[38:24] you are the great I am and I just want
[38:26] to ask Lord May your anointing flow this
[38:28] morning may you anoint speaker and
[38:30] hearer may you increase our faith father
[38:33] may you take control of every Spirit
[38:35] that's not of you may you have
[38:37] preeminence in this service may your
[38:38] blood cover us and we're asking that
[38:40] you'd forgive us of all of our sins our
[38:42] iniquities cleanse us Lord of every evil
[38:44] thought and may you be glorified we love
[38:46] you so much we thank you for this
[38:48] opportunity that we can gather together
[38:50] and worship as redeemed people under
[38:52] your blood so we thank you Lord have
[38:54] your way in the service for your glory
[38:55] in Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:58] amen God bless you friends you may have
[39:00] your seats this morning so I want to I
[39:02] want to talk about the start well I'd
[39:05] probably say this often but I want to
[39:06] start looking into a bit of a subject
[39:08] about the anointed bride body of Jesus
[39:10] Christ so I'm going to preach about you
[39:11] today and maybe we'll see as it goes
[39:13] along but you know we I was um I was
[39:16] pondering a few things this week and I
[39:18] just wanted to start here by you know
[39:20] where where the Apostle Paul says that
[39:22] where the spirit of the Lord is you know
[39:23] before he uh these scriptures he's
[39:25] saying about that the there's a V over
[39:27] the face of the Jews with the reading of
[39:29] Moses and you know because they so
[39:31] there's that Veil when that when that
[39:33] vow is taken away then there is a
[39:35] liberty then there is then there is a
[39:37] then there's an opening or or a
[39:39] revealing of Christ now that word
[39:41] Liberty means to go free as a son so
[39:43] we're no longer we are no longer slaves
[39:45] or servants or anything like that we are
[39:47] the children of God and the reason that
[39:50] the Liberty the spirit of the Lord comes
[39:51] upon us is because we are his children
[39:54] as it says in the book of Galatians
[39:56] because we are Sons he sent forth his
[39:58] Spirit upon us where we cry Abba Father
[40:00] so we do not become Sons or daughters by
[40:03] the new birth we are born again because
[40:05] we are his children now I pray that all
[40:07] of the fear and the worry and the
[40:09] anxiety of am I going to make it would
[40:10] just leave I I believe that we're living
[40:13] in a season where we don't need to be
[40:15] afraid we don't need to guess we don't
[40:17] need to Hope if we're going in a Rapture
[40:19] but God wants it so secured in our
[40:21] hearts Beyond emotion Beyond feelings
[40:23] Beyond good days bad days beyond all
[40:25] those things there's an anchor in our
[40:27] hearts
[40:28] me where we know in whom we have
[40:29] believed like the Apostle Paul says that
[40:32] we can stand in confidence no matter
[40:34] what's going on in life amen so this
[40:36] word here where we're CH where the
[40:38] Apostle Paul says we are changed into
[40:40] the same image from glory to glory so
[40:43] that word change means a trans to be
[40:46] transformed and that's where we get the
[40:47] word of metamorphosis and when you you
[40:50] think of a caterpillar come turning into
[40:52] a butterfly there's a process where that
[40:54] caterpillar is an Earthbound creature
[40:56] can't fly doesn't look like what it's
[40:58] meant to be but it goes through a
[41:00] process where it is transformed from a
[41:03] caterpillar into a butterfly now the
[41:06] life within it transforms it amen it's
[41:09] it doesn't need all it needs to do is
[41:10] eat whoever seen monarch butterflies
[41:13] they'll get on that swamp plant they'll
[41:14] chew the thing down and they'll chew it
[41:16] down all over again but it's by eating
[41:19] that amen the life within them is
[41:21] transformed into the butterfly it's the
[41:24] same thing we all we need to do is feed
[41:26] on the word of God Amen drink enjoy the
[41:29] word pray love the Lord what happens is
[41:32] you're bringing you're feeding your
[41:33] spiritual Inner Man to bring a
[41:35] transformation now if you look at things
[41:38] things can change like a caterpillar
[41:41] looks nothing like a butterfly there's a
[41:42] great change goes place and and even if
[41:45] you look at say natural uh things like
[41:47] for example this is this is the biggest
[41:48] C CI Tree in New Zealand that's that's
[41:51] still standing it's called they call it
[41:52] tan mahuta now that that tree which is I
[41:55] don't know how many 50 meters tall wider
[41:58] than I am tall all these things started
[42:00] as a little seed it started as this
[42:02] little insignificant seed but it was
[42:05] planted in the right ground it received
[42:07] nutrients and then it grew into this big
[42:09] Mighty tree now the life everything
[42:12] within the tree is in the seed brother
[42:14] brah says that that that that that Apple
[42:17] you take one apple seed and it said
[42:19] every bushel of apples that will ever
[42:20] grow from when you PL that seed it grows
[42:23] into a tree and the apples come out is
[42:25] already in that seed all it needs to do
[42:28] is grow be in the right atmosphere and
[42:30] we need to be in an atmosphere of Faith
[42:32] am me an atmosphere of believing where
[42:34] all things are possible saying yes the
[42:35] word is Right amen it doesn't matter how
[42:38] I feel what I'm going through the word
[42:39] is always right and and God is more than
[42:42] able to perform his promises in my life
[42:44] amen because he he fulfills his word in
[42:47] spite of whatever state we find
[42:49] ourselves in amen you see Israel was
[42:51] down in slavery in Egypt but yet God
[42:53] said I'm going to bring them out with a
[42:55] mighty hand so it doesn't matter what
[42:56] condition and God's word nothing can
[42:59] stop him unbelief only hinders the
[43:01] unbeliever amen it doesn't stop God God
[43:03] goes right on and he fulfills his word
[43:06] now here's just a picture of one of
[43:07] those trees cut down you see how wide
[43:09] that bit of the trunk is massive thing
[43:12] started as just a small seed every seed
[43:15] has great potential in it now here's a
[43:17] quiz who's
[43:20] this no one knows who this
[43:23] is there we go Albert Einstein yeah
[43:26] correct
[43:28] correct in the he so he's about 3 years
[43:31] old here in him is the potential to be
[43:33] the greatest mind of the last 100 years
[43:37] the greatest scientific genius he's a
[43:39] three-year-old now you look at him you
[43:40] don't know the potential in him you
[43:42] don't know he's going to write the
[43:44] theory of relativity and do incredible
[43:46] things in science just just within his
[43:48] mind and they do experiments now to
[43:50] prove what he what he put forth as a
[43:52] theory he couldn't prove it necessarily
[43:54] back then but all mathematics and
[43:55] equations and things but came out of him
[43:57] somewhere but as a three-year-old you
[43:59] think there's no way he'd do that he's
[44:01] just probably a naughty little normal
[44:02] boy but within him is genius right as
[44:05] the same thing within us amen there's
[44:07] incredible gifts and ability and an
[44:10] ability to believe the word of God an
[44:12] ability to take God at his word and
[44:14] ability to fully surrender to the full
[44:16] word of God there's incredible potential
[44:19] within you and I just like in the seed
[44:22] of a cry tree there's incredible
[44:24] potential for it to grow now God knows
[44:26] what we're going to turn into right God
[44:29] knows before we're ever born upon the
[44:31] Earth he deposited a seed Gene of God
[44:35] and he said let every seed bring forth
[44:37] after its kind amen if God has planted
[44:40] something it's going to grow it's going
[44:42] to come forth it may be buried for
[44:44] hundreds of years they say well I think
[44:46] it was in brother Bam's day but I think
[44:48] recently they found it too they found
[44:49] seeds that were thousands of years old
[44:52] wheat seeds in Egypt and they planted
[44:54] them and they came to life amen so it
[44:57] can be thousand a seed can be thousands
[44:58] of years dormant but when it comes to
[45:00] the right atmosphere right condition
[45:02] it'll bring forth what's within it amen
[45:04] as the same thing with you and I we can
[45:06] go decades we can go most of our life
[45:08] without knowing god but yet in God's
[45:10] season amen as Sunshine begins to shine
[45:13] and you know Sunshine shines and the
[45:15] water comes everything and what we come
[45:16] to life so that with is which is within
[45:19] us amen comes to life now this is him as
[45:22] an old man now I thought this is good we
[45:24] cannot solve our problems with the same
[45:26] thinging we used when we created
[45:29] them so if you're in this constant cycle
[45:31] of problems say God change my thinking
[45:34] may I think above the way I think may I
[45:36] look more than what I see amen so we
[45:39] can't see because I think he he even
[45:41] said I'm not sure who said it but
[45:42] insanity is doing the same thing over
[45:45] and over again expecting a different
[45:47] result I mean and man is insane they're
[45:50] doing the same thing look we're coming
[45:52] into a cycle we know it's prophesied
[45:53] there'll be an armagon there's going to
[45:55] be a Great Tribulation but the problems
[45:57] that that that were before the first
[45:59] world war and the second world war and
[46:01] every other great conflict that's been
[46:03] in history they're all here again
[46:05] history repeats itself because man
[46:07] thinks they can do the same thing but
[46:09] get a different result it'll never
[46:10] happen that's why we need the mind of
[46:12] Christ now if you look at the seeds that
[46:14] have been buried but God has planted uh
[46:17] in in someone's life for example the
[46:19] woman at the well you know no one would
[46:21] have thought that she was a
[46:24] predestinated bride of Jesus Christ no
[46:27] one would have thought that they thought
[46:28] she was just a Samaritan she was a
[46:29] hybrid Jew and a I you know Gentile and
[46:32] a Jew lineage and all these things she
[46:34] was a woman of ill Fame but deep down
[46:36] within her was that seed that that that
[46:38] she could recognize the Messiah in her
[46:41] day and that's the greatest thing amen
[46:43] that will ever come out of your life was
[46:45] when you recognize the Messiah the
[46:47] anointed word in the day you live amen
[46:49] that's an incredible blessing to say
[46:51] that's more than a prophet that's more
[46:53] than a Healing Ministry amen this
[46:54] message is more than a Healing Ministry
[46:56] it's more than a prophet amen but is
[46:58] Jesus Christ revealed am mean cuz you're
[47:00] in the same condition like the woman at
[47:02] the well was I mean brother Ram said
[47:04] when when when our lord Jesus spoke to
[47:06] her amen the light of his word redeemed
[47:09] her amen it transformed her life amen
[47:12] from a woman of ill Fame because she
[47:14] dropped her water pot amen she came to
[47:16] the well with all kind of trouble but
[47:18] when she recognized Messiah those
[47:20] troubles just went away I mean and she
[47:22] walked she she ran back into the city
[47:24] saying come see a man who told me
[47:26] everything I ever did
[47:27] is this not the very Messiah and it's
[47:29] the same thing with you and I friends
[47:30] when we recognize this message as Jesus
[47:32] Christ there's a transformation takes
[47:34] place in our life and when we hear the
[47:36] voice behind the voice you say this is
[47:38] not William brandham this is God
[47:39] speaking to me it changes Our Lives it
[47:42] changed my life amen and it still is
[47:45] changing my life Hallelujah you take the
[47:47] you take the you Peter James and John
[47:49] you take the this is Jesus uh calling
[47:52] them no one would have they weren't in
[47:54] the Sanhedrin let's just think about
[47:56] this they weren't in the Inner Circle
[47:58] you know if you went on some if they had
[48:00] YouTube back then and there was debates
[48:02] within the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees
[48:03] and the scribes and different religious
[48:05] Giants of of the day they weren't in
[48:07] those panels they weren't even near
[48:09] those places they weren't even
[48:10] considered but yet God knew that in
[48:13] their souls was that seed of God Amen
[48:16] that he was going to call in his season
[48:18] amen so that's why it's an incredible
[48:20] thing you can never judge a book by its
[48:22] cover you can never judge a person by
[48:24] the outward appearance amen it's that
[48:27] within them that matters and maybe they
[48:29] might not receive it in day one but you
[48:31] just got to believe God Quicken them
[48:33] that's why it's so important to have an
[48:34] atmosphere of faith in our homes an
[48:36] atmosphere of faith in church amen that
[48:38] God can come on the scene and change
[48:41] lives Hallelujah but you see now the
[48:44] devil as God is in The Bu business of
[48:46] transforming the devil loves to deform
[48:49] amen and and and I say naturally this
[48:51] was a this this kind of life she had was
[48:53] a deformed
[48:55] life Paul but well Saul before he became
[48:58] Paul that he was deformed he was
[49:01] deformed by religion deformed by Creeds
[49:03] and dogmas of man but it doesn't matter
[49:05] how deform someone starts that doesn't
[49:08] matter if that seed is going to come to
[49:10] life God will take out all the chinks
[49:12] and make them straight amen make them
[49:14] grow them according to the word amen so
[49:17] because Satan can only pervert he cannot
[49:20] create he's got no he he he's not
[49:22] original right just like so many people
[49:25] there's so many different fashion fads
[49:26] out there and people say I want to be
[49:27] original I want to be something
[49:29] different and they begin to dress like
[49:30] everyone else that's trending amen it's
[49:33] a so there's nothing original nothing
[49:35] new Under the Sun and the devil all he
[49:38] does is deform he can't create he's not
[49:41] a Creator all he can do is deform amen
[49:44] take something from its original state
[49:46] there is where something that's gone
[49:48] wrong with it now I'm going to bring
[49:49] this right into um of course religion
[49:52] because he wants to be worshiped now
[49:54] Satan loves to create he well not that's
[49:57] the wrong word but to deform a true walk
[49:59] with God he wants to deform us Walking
[50:03] with God according to Revelation and he
[50:05] wants to deform it to become a natural
[50:08] Church anity of rules and regulations
[50:11] and all those things that's a deforming
[50:14] amen because brother Braham says it I
[50:16] don't know where the quote is exactly
[50:17] but he said the greatest mistake Israel
[50:20] ever made when they came out of Egypt as
[50:22] they wanted a law you see God already
[50:24] provided them Grace amen he sent a
[50:27] prophet with Y to deliver them he gave
[50:29] them the blood of the Passover the death
[50:31] angel couldn't strike them amen he
[50:33] brought P judgment upon Egypt they
[50:35] didn't have to do a thing all they had
[50:37] to do was believe what that Prophet told
[50:39] them amen and apply the blood but when
[50:41] they came out through the red SE they
[50:43] came to Mount Si they said they wanted a
[50:45] LW and that's the problem is that man
[50:47] has always wanted something to do to
[50:50] Merit salvation and that is the biggest
[50:52] problem is that man has always been
[50:54] trying to add their own bit instead of
[50:56] letting God transform them amen and
[50:59] that's and and and that that's the
[51:01] biggest thing in this day we've got to
[51:02] let God transform us amen not not try
[51:05] and change things ourselves you see see
[51:08] because you know the devil is as I said
[51:10] he is a perverter sin is righteousness
[51:13] perverted amen you know adultery is the
[51:16] right act perverted done wrong
[51:19] fornication the same thing you know a
[51:21] lie is the truth perverted so all he can
[51:23] do is pervert and he wants to bring that
[51:25] into our lives to to to pervert us
[51:30] Walking with God in Victory yeah amen
[51:32] that's that's what he wants us to do
[51:34] like even think about you know you know
[51:36] we are made to be happy we are made to
[51:39] walk in joy we are ordained to walk in
[51:41] Joy ordained to walk in peace you know
[51:44] ordained to walk in love that's what
[51:46] we're ordained to do but the devil will
[51:48] come and pervert the atmosphere in our
[51:50] minds to make us worried about nothing
[51:53] to make us stressed about things that
[51:54] don't matter things that'll change
[51:56] tomorrow you know he tries to that
[51:58] that's why he tries to bring fussing and
[51:59] fighting and ought and trouble what's he
[52:01] doing he's trying to pervert an
[52:03] atmosphere of perfect love into one of
[52:05] tension grief strife and trouble he's
[52:08] just perverting the atmosphere but if
[52:10] you can realize that's what he's doing
[52:12] you can withstand him amen remember he
[52:14] always comes with a lot of Reason a lot
[52:16] of valid he would call points of why and
[52:18] this person did this and this and it can
[52:20] be all right but you have a right to
[52:22] stop that atmosphere and say no I have
[52:25] the Lord has said love thy neighbor as
[52:27] thyself amen love the Brethren amen
[52:30] because remember Jesus forgave me of a
[52:32] lot of
[52:34] things amen the reason he hung on
[52:36] Calvary is not the Romans or the Jews it
[52:38] was me I'm the reason he died I'm the
[52:41] reason he was nailed and M and all those
[52:43] things it was my fault I'm the
[52:46] Man Hallelujah but yet he did it for me
[52:49] anyway amen because he loved me when I
[52:52] was his enemy amen so I think if if if
[52:55] he can love me that kind of love I think
[52:57] I can love you people with that kind of
[52:59] love too when I you know no one's done
[53:01] anything like that to me hallelujah amen
[53:05] so you see the devil wants to create a
[53:07] bad atmosphere in our minds and always
[53:08] trouble and this is a problem and all
[53:10] these things and create a complex even
[53:12] brother bah say someone who's sick too
[53:14] long it can create a complex in their
[53:15] life but God is working everything for
[53:17] your good I mean God is doing something
[53:20] in our lives we we really we need to
[53:22] realize we're not occupying time we're
[53:24] not just going through the motions you
[53:26] say well Monday to Friday I go to the
[53:28] same job I do the same things I go to
[53:29] school it's the same and all these
[53:31] things and God is working in the every
[53:33] day I mean we cannot forget that amen we
[53:36] we see the devil is the author of
[53:38] frustration God is not the author of
[53:40] frustration he's not the author of
[53:42] confusion so the devil will take the
[53:44] peace of God he'll take the you know
[53:47] just walking the everyday simple
[53:48] Christian Life and he'll pervert that by
[53:51] saying God's not doing
[53:53] anything Satan's lying to you Satan's
[53:56] lying to you God is working every day
[53:57] he's doing something in your life he's
[53:59] molding you's you he's doing he's
[54:01] wanting to reveal himself but the devil
[54:02] wants to clad us over with troubles and
[54:05] doubts and he wants to pervert the
[54:07] atmosphere in our mind I say we're done
[54:09] with that amen I'm done hallelujah does
[54:13] that mean he'll stop no he'll he'll try
[54:15] CU he's a creature of habit amen but you
[54:17] see every every spirit that comes
[54:19] against us we have a right to withstand
[54:21] amen amen Draw N to God Amen and the
[54:24] devil will flee amen prise the Lord you
[54:26] see now but the thing is that the devil
[54:28] as I said he loves to pervert now he
[54:31] wants to take he wants to take
[54:33] Christianity now this is what got me
[54:35] thinking about this whole service today
[54:37] just a thought came to mind brother BR
[54:39] speaking Christ is a mystery of God
[54:41] revealed amen so God was God was
[54:44] manifested in Jesus Christ amen and then
[54:47] he what is manifested in the bride in
[54:50] order to take the bride and bridegroom
[54:52] and restore the world right three-fold
[54:54] revelation of God now he says so many
[54:58] people has got the wrong conception to
[55:00] convert Christian uh people to
[55:02] Christianity and to its government it's
[55:04] not God's thought at all now people
[55:07] would say no that is what you do you
[55:10] bring people to church they become
[55:12] believers they conform to however the
[55:15] church operates and no that's just been
[55:17] converted to uh a government of a of a
[55:20] church or denomination that is not God's
[55:22] thoughts at all see as I said about
[55:24] Israel the worst mistake they ever did
[55:26] was wanting a law and the worst mistake
[55:29] a Believer can ever do is say just tell
[55:30] me what I need to do give me a list of
[55:33] things give me a checklist that's not
[55:35] walking with God at all that's
[55:36] conforming to the government of a
[55:38] religion amen but but no we are the
[55:40] anointed bride body of Jesus Christ I
[55:43] mean so this very thought should be
[55:44] foreign to us of trying to get a people
[55:47] to con to to just adapt to a church or
[55:49] religious government that is not God's
[55:52] thoughts at all amen it is not God's
[55:54] thoughts to for man's ability
[55:56] to live a good life and therefore that's
[55:59] Christianity that's not Christianity at
[56:01] all no it's actually a perversion of God
[56:04] wanting of the devil twisting in
[56:06] people's minds of of God wanting to walk
[56:09] with his people he wants to reveal
[56:11] himself to us does he not amen so it's
[56:15] not it's not man's thought I mean it's
[56:16] not God's thought at all to try and get
[56:18] us just to conform to a bunch of rules
[56:20] now we understand there are things in
[56:22] the word that we follow right we
[56:24] understand that but you know it's not a
[56:26] it's not a tick boox thing God needs to
[56:28] reveal to you yeah see even how to dress
[56:31] how to act all these things God needs to
[56:33] reveal it now there's a sister that you
[56:35] know years ago when she first came to
[56:37] the message you know she was you know
[56:39] wearing pants and she started wearing a
[56:40] skirt it was a short skirt but God but
[56:43] then it got longer as she was walking
[56:44] with God now a skirt that's down to the
[56:46] floor is not more righteous than a one
[56:48] that's below the
[56:49] knees long sleeves are not more
[56:51] righteous than short
[56:52] sleeves but man wants to make it that if
[56:55] you're basically wearing a burka you're
[56:58] modest no that is Holiness
[57:02] perverted amen that is Holiness
[57:04] perverted I'm wearing a sack therefore
[57:06] I'm a I'm really Sanctified no that is
[57:08] Holiness perverted now you've got to
[57:11] know what's too tight and not too tight
[57:13] it's a relationship with
[57:15] God it's not rocket science it's Lord is
[57:18] this pleasing to you and maybe at the
[57:20] stage you are maybe it isn't maybe it's
[57:21] not but just walk with God I saying
[57:23] about the sister her her her her her
[57:25] skirt start a real short they got longer
[57:28] but it was God was revealing these
[57:29] things to she was walking with God now
[57:32] I'm sure some people wanted to grab her
[57:34] put her in the front room and and just
[57:35] just just throw the book at her kind of
[57:37] thing but that's trying to convert
[57:39] someone to the government of the church
[57:41] that's not going to bring a birth that's
[57:42] not going to help anyone see and that's
[57:44] why people have miserably failed as
[57:46] they've tried to just adopt what they
[57:48] see as the tenants of the message
[57:49] without knowing God hallelujah amen
[57:51] because if you know him he'll reveal his
[57:53] word to you he will show you the things
[57:55] that are pleasing in not pleasing it's
[57:57] you know it's it's it's it's quite
[57:58] simple yeah I'm sure God talks to us
[58:02] amen why did he die on Calvary to have a
[58:04] true spiritual relationship with you and
[58:06] I amen that we can talk to him and he
[58:08] talks back amen he reveals himself
[58:10] through preaching through his word
[58:11] through prayer all those different ways
[58:13] you know so it's not it was never God's
[58:16] idea to convert people to its government
[58:19] of Christianity no cuz he says here look
[58:23] um we make converts to Christianity buys
[58:26] government that's not it well they're
[58:28] not supposed to drink they're not
[58:30] supposed to lie do you know the
[58:31] muhammadans can outshine you you know
[58:33] the heathens in Africa then black men
[58:35] they've got laws among their tribes that
[58:36] outshine anything you can produce in
[58:39] Christianity am mean so he's saying look
[58:41] this is not how it's meant to be done
[58:43] we're not meant to put Grievous weights
[58:44] on one another of of conforming to to
[58:47] laws like that you know because it's
[58:50] like the Pharisees they would they put
[58:52] laws on the people that they wouldn't
[58:53] bear themselves yeah you know so we
[58:56] can't put Grievous weights on our young
[58:58] people we can't put some weight if you
[59:01] ever conformed to this thing and and you
[59:02] never did it when you were young amen
[59:05] that's right I'm not going to go into
[59:06] detail we'll go into a youth service
[59:07] later I'm just going to lay platform for
[59:09] maybe a month later but you know we
[59:11] don't want to put things on people that
[59:13] they're not ready to Bear you say well
[59:16] that's being too liberal no what it does
[59:18] is it creates an environment where God
[59:19] can deal with
[59:21] them because what it's the same God that
[59:23] met you has got to meet them right and
[59:26] God brought you from a mighty long way
[59:28] he brought me from a deep dark pit what
[59:29] I once was and what I am now thank God
[59:31] I'm not that guy amen but you see God
[59:34] needs to reveal himself they have to
[59:36] want what you have amen you know we we
[59:40] have to sell the product right where we
[59:43] talk about joy unspeakable there should
[59:44] be a manifestation of that Joy there
[59:47] should be a thankfulness you know I
[59:48] think um you know we were talking about
[59:50] you know me or Christine crying and
[59:52] we're saying well most of our tears are
[59:53] happy tears this is what our children
[59:56] Children See happy tears and I think
[59:57] that's how we should be we should be
[59:59] crying happy more than sad amen and even
[1:00:01] when we're sad well there's no we we
[1:00:03] don't have a sadness that that is
[1:00:05] without hope cuz our God is more than
[1:00:07] able amen we are not undone we're not
[1:00:10] lost we're not you know we're not
[1:00:11] without hope now our God can do
[1:00:14] anything amen so well you say well if
[1:00:16] it's not to be like that then what's it
[1:00:18] meant to be well brother BR makes it
[1:00:19] real clear now God now notice God make
[1:00:22] himself n we're not supposed to convert
[1:00:24] uh make converts to Christianity by its
[1:00:27] government but by the Revelation amen
[1:00:30] that's how we make converts to Christ
[1:00:32] amen is that when they receive the
[1:00:34] revelation of Jesus Christ when you
[1:00:36] receive the Revelation that you're a
[1:00:37] sinner that's a glorious thing am me
[1:00:39] when you gave your life to the Lord
[1:00:40] what's that God has begin to reveal
[1:00:41] himself to you begin to speak to your
[1:00:43] life what is he doing he wants to
[1:00:45] convert you to real Christianity amen
[1:00:48] that you would walk with him and know
[1:00:50] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:00:52] amen that's why it's so important that
[1:00:54] Revelation is key amen I trust that we
[1:00:56] pray for our children that they would
[1:00:58] receive Revelation that God would drop
[1:01:00] it in their hearts that this is not just
[1:01:02] church this is not just people Gathering
[1:01:04] but this is God and man uniting together
[1:01:07] amen that's what the message came to do
[1:01:09] is that God would dwell in man once
[1:01:10] again and manifest his word amen so
[1:01:13] people are made so people come into the
[1:01:15] bride body of Jesus Christ by Revelation
[1:01:18] amen as Paul said by one Spirit we're
[1:01:20] baptized into one body amen that's by
[1:01:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:01:25] that's why that's why you say you know
[1:01:27] people are ask a question are you a
[1:01:28] Christian they want to know what kind of
[1:01:29] Christian you are and um you know but
[1:01:32] but we're not Christians by joining a
[1:01:34] church right amen but you're but you're
[1:01:36] a Christian if you're a born again
[1:01:38] creature amen if you've been born again
[1:01:41] amen you're a Christian amen you've been
[1:01:44] born into the family amen you got to see
[1:01:46] like you know brother Brown makes a
[1:01:47] statement you know he's been in the he
[1:01:49] said he was in the brandom family like
[1:01:50] 53 years no one asked them to join the
[1:01:53] family I never asked my girls or will do
[1:01:56] you want to join the gloin family will
[1:01:58] you ever ask that L will you ever ask
[1:02:00] that question no you're born into the
[1:02:02] family amen so so if they were born into
[1:02:05] the family nothing can take them out of
[1:02:07] the family amen if they join the family
[1:02:09] we could say well no they're not part of
[1:02:11] the family but no they it's impossible
[1:02:13] for my children to actually be to to
[1:02:15] leave the glowing family because because
[1:02:18] they are blood relation to me amen my
[1:02:21] DNA is in them amen my life is in them
[1:02:23] amen if we had a blood test it would
[1:02:25] prove are my children they're not
[1:02:27] distant relatives they are my children
[1:02:29] amen so it's the same thing when you're
[1:02:30] born into the kingdom amen you see you
[1:02:32] never joined it see the devil tries to
[1:02:34] get you to unjoin it you should leave
[1:02:36] this there's nothing to it you should go
[1:02:38] into the world go do something else he's
[1:02:39] trying to get you to break up your
[1:02:42] membership but he's got the wrong
[1:02:44] picture cuz none of us joined we were
[1:02:46] born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] and me the word came out away and
[1:02:50] transformed us so if we're born in we
[1:02:52] can't get unborn out Hallelujah we can't
[1:02:55] get unborn out friends see that's why
[1:02:57] it's so important we realize that we we
[1:02:59] have been brought in by a supernatural
[1:03:00] birth amen God has quickened his word to
[1:03:03] us amen so we can't be unjoined the
[1:03:06] devil says leave you say well I can't
[1:03:08] leave I'm part of the body amen it's
[1:03:11] like my you know my arm can't suddenly
[1:03:13] just just pop out and walk off somewhere
[1:03:15] and no it's part of my body amen it
[1:03:17] can't it can't just say I'm sick of this
[1:03:18] guy and I'm done no it's part of me
[1:03:20] Hallelujah and we're part of him Lord
[1:03:23] hallelujah we may get sick of ourselves
[1:03:25] but he doesn't get of us amen why cuz
[1:03:27] we're part of him hallelujah amen but
[1:03:30] you see organization is something that's
[1:03:32] been adapted or adopted into the program
[1:03:34] of God but it's never ever meant to be
[1:03:37] that way amen it's meant to be divine
[1:03:39] revelation amen is to come into our
[1:03:42] lives to speak to us and show us who we
[1:03:45] really are now you see but the devil
[1:03:47] loves to take the Supernatural and and
[1:03:49] swap it for the natural that's what he's
[1:03:51] done down Through the Ages that's why
[1:03:53] you know churches used to be cold for
[1:03:55] lukew powerless is because he took the
[1:03:57] moving of the spirit the power of God
[1:03:59] the signs and wonders done the reality
[1:04:01] of Walking with God and he adopted into
[1:04:03] a natural
[1:04:04] program I've just learned these
[1:04:06] doctrines learn this way and then you're
[1:04:09] a Christian see that's a natural program
[1:04:11] but God's word is never meant to be that
[1:04:12] way no we are called to be the
[1:04:14] powerhouses of the Holy Ghost amen where
[1:04:17] people come into our presence and they
[1:04:18] feel refreshed cuz there's those Shady
[1:04:20] Lea leaves of Fellowship amen over our
[1:04:23] lives there's an atmosphere we carry
[1:04:25] amen that lifts burdens brings peace
[1:04:27] brings joy that I trust when people meet
[1:04:30] you and then they leave they feel better
[1:04:31] amen why because they've been in the
[1:04:33] presence of God irrespective of how you
[1:04:35] are in here see our emotional realm and
[1:04:38] our spiritual realm can be two different
[1:04:39] things am mean because remember you can
[1:04:41] be troubled inside but you're still
[1:04:42] anointed amen you can be in Dire Straits
[1:04:45] but you're still anointed I mean that
[1:04:47] life in you is still bringing forth
[1:04:49] praise the Lord amen you can be sick but
[1:04:50] you're still anointed amen you can be
[1:04:52] poor but still anointed you can not know
[1:04:55] what what's to happen tomorrow but
[1:04:56] you're still anointed amen why cuz you
[1:04:58] are the anointed bride body of Jesus
[1:05:00] Christ Hallelujah so we got to realize
[1:05:02] now we are a special people I mean God
[1:05:05] has born you birthed you into the
[1:05:06] kingdom we are his children he said Can
[1:05:09] a you know a mother can forget a
[1:05:11] suckling child but I cannot forget thee
[1:05:13] Hallelujah so I know I don't know how
[1:05:15] that's possible for a natural woman to
[1:05:17] you know forget a child but God said
[1:05:19] that that may even be the case but I'll
[1:05:20] never forget thee you're engraved in the
[1:05:22] palm of my hands before the foundation
[1:05:24] of the world you are thoughts and my
[1:05:25] mind and now you hear upon the earth now
[1:05:28] it's amazing you know I was thinking
[1:05:29] about the um you know brother Bram when
[1:05:32] he was going through Montana and you
[1:05:34] know the Lord told him to stop the car
[1:05:35] and look at this Seven Peaks of these
[1:05:37] mountains now I I found a photo but it's
[1:05:40] not a very good quality one so I didn't
[1:05:41] put it up but it's amazing when you know
[1:05:44] you look at those you look at that photo
[1:05:46] now those mountains are called brandom
[1:05:48] Peaks and it wasn't Believers that named
[1:05:50] it some geological board guy decided
[1:05:53] this is Brandon Peak so maybe someone
[1:05:54] brandom climbed I don't know but but it
[1:05:58] isn't it amazing I don't know when those
[1:06:00] mountains were formed but before they
[1:06:02] ever formed they're in God's mind I'm
[1:06:04] going to have Malachi 4 come in a
[1:06:06] certain season I'm going to write his
[1:06:09] life in these mountains and he caused
[1:06:10] those mountains to come up right he had
[1:06:13] all that there before brotherr even came
[1:06:15] upon the Earth and then now he tells him
[1:06:17] look at this your life is written in
[1:06:19] those mountains those mountains are
[1:06:21] symbolic of the life that you are living
[1:06:23] and it's incredible when you look into
[1:06:25] the book of Revelation there's symbols
[1:06:26] in the book amen part of them is the
[1:06:28] Bride of Jesus Christ you know I was
[1:06:30] thinking of Revelations 19 when the Lord
[1:06:32] would come with that you know you know
[1:06:35] the word of God the the sword coming out
[1:06:36] of his mouth and the armies of Heaven
[1:06:38] coming with him you know those are all
[1:06:40] symbols of the Bride of Jesus Christ am
[1:06:42] mean coming to fight the battle of
[1:06:43] Armageddon so before we ever turned up
[1:06:46] it was a symbol in the book just like
[1:06:48] before he has ever born those mountains
[1:06:49] are a symbol of his life amen so so they
[1:06:53] they were there before we even turned up
[1:06:55] amen they were there before we even
[1:06:57] realized they were there and that
[1:06:59] Hallelujah so God has prepared things to
[1:07:02] show us what we're going to be amen but
[1:07:04] now it's like a you know he sees what's
[1:07:06] in the seed and then he produces the
[1:07:08] life that's in that seed so he sees
[1:07:10] what's in the word and he knows you're
[1:07:13] going to become it amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:15] he knows you're going to become it so
[1:07:16] when it says in Revelations 19 earlier
[1:07:18] that the bride is made herself ready and
[1:07:21] unto her should should be was granted
[1:07:22] should be ar raay in linen clean and
[1:07:24] white the righteous of saints that was
[1:07:25] there for th you know 2,000 years before
[1:07:28] you showed up Hallelujah God had it
[1:07:31] Neons of time but he he knew your life
[1:07:33] will match that symbol just like you
[1:07:35] knew brother bram's life would match the
[1:07:36] mountains amen so God had all these
[1:07:38] things pre-ordained
[1:07:40] amen and then then he brought us here to
[1:07:43] match what he already had in his mind
[1:07:46] Hallelujah so that's why we are not
[1:07:48] converting people to Christianity by its
[1:07:50] government no it's by Revelation amen
[1:07:54] because if it becomes by if it comes by
[1:07:56] Revelation to you which it must then you
[1:07:58] realize I'm part of this I'm not just
[1:08:01] here because I decided it was a nice
[1:08:03] place the meals are good the music's
[1:08:04] good the whatever's good no I'm here
[1:08:06] because I'm part of this word that's why
[1:08:08] I'm part of this body you know wherever
[1:08:10] we go to church we got to realize we are
[1:08:12] part of the word of God Amen just like
[1:08:15] when you read in the Book of Revelation
[1:08:16] I saying about the bride and different
[1:08:17] things you begin to realize that symbols
[1:08:19] you it's no longer a symbol it's now
[1:08:22] Revelation manifested amen so Hallelujah
[1:08:25] that I think it's a wonderful thing you
[1:08:27] see we can never organize the Church of
[1:08:30] the Living God as a government no it's
[1:08:32] by divine revelation Hallelujah now
[1:08:36] let's just look at this if if if
[1:08:37] someone's not feeling happy I'm going to
[1:08:39] make you
[1:08:40] happy cuz I'm going to read about you
[1:08:42] what he's already done amen and he is
[1:08:44] before all things and by him all things
[1:08:46] consist and he is the head of the body
[1:08:48] the church who is the beginning the
[1:08:50] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:08:52] things he might have the preeminence for
[1:08:54] it pleased the father that in him should
[1:08:56] all fullness dwell and having made peace
[1:08:58] through the blood of his cross by him to
[1:09:01] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[1:09:04] I say whether they be in the Earth or
[1:09:06] things in heaven and you who's you
[1:09:09] that's me that's you that were sometime
[1:09:12] alienated and EM enemies in your mind by
[1:09:14] Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled
[1:09:18] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:09:20] to present you holy and unblamable and
[1:09:24] unreprovable in his sight that's got to
[1:09:27] become a revelation he's not saying he
[1:09:30] might he has hallelujah amen and it's
[1:09:33] and see really When I See This I say
[1:09:35] Lord I just see the work of your hands
[1:09:37] what you have done for me amen so he's
[1:09:40] he has come in this end time to present
[1:09:43] us holy and unblamable and unreprovable
[1:09:47] in his sight now this is a God who sees
[1:09:49] all things amen he You Can't Hide
[1:09:51] nothing from him but yet I've made you
[1:09:53] holy unblamable and reproval in his
[1:09:56] sight you can't pull the wool over his
[1:09:58] eyes he sees all things the only way
[1:10:00] that all those anything against you can
[1:10:02] be struck off if it's under the blood of
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ amen because if it goes
[1:10:05] under the blood God can't see it amen he
[1:10:08] says if you continue in the faith
[1:10:10] grounded and settled that you be not
[1:10:11] moved away from the hope of the Gospel
[1:10:13] which you have heard and which was
[1:10:15] preached to every creature which is
[1:10:16] under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a
[1:10:20] minister now this word continue means to
[1:10:22] remain to abide to continue amen so if
[1:10:26] you realize you're part of the word
[1:10:27] you're going to abide in it Hallelujah
[1:10:30] you're you're not going to leave the
[1:10:31] word just like you know uh Ruth didn't
[1:10:33] realize it at the time but when she came
[1:10:35] into boaz's field Boaz said stay in this
[1:10:37] field don't leave this field you stay
[1:10:39] right in this field she didn't realize
[1:10:41] that she was going to be married to Boaz
[1:10:42] one day and that field was part of her
[1:10:45] because she was part of him it's the
[1:10:46] same thing when we come into the word of
[1:10:48] God God says stay in this field stay in
[1:10:50] the field of the son of man stay in this
[1:10:52] revealed word gleen get what you can out
[1:10:54] of it amen and God wants to reveal to
[1:10:56] you actually this field belongs to you
[1:10:58] because you belong to him amen you're
[1:11:00] part of him so if you realize see see if
[1:11:03] if we just come into the message by an
[1:11:05] intellectual understanding converting to
[1:11:07] his government just because of well
[1:11:09] these dos and don'ts and rules and
[1:11:10] regulations then you can leave because
[1:11:13] it's just something you adopt it's
[1:11:14] something that you take on it's a good
[1:11:16] idea amen but if but if you come in the
[1:11:18] right way by divine revelation you
[1:11:21] cannot leave you will abide in the word
[1:11:22] of God you cannot leave the word amen
[1:11:26] Hallelujah so we're going to see if you
[1:11:28] continue in the faith and and and we
[1:11:30] know faith is a revelation so if you
[1:11:32] continue in the Revelation grounded and
[1:11:34] sealed and be not moved away from the
[1:11:37] hope and hope is an expectation with
[1:11:38] pleasure of the Gospel yeah amen so
[1:11:40] that's why we've got to continue in the
[1:11:42] Revelation Amen Let God reveal his word
[1:11:44] to us don't be don't be intimidated by
[1:11:47] great intellectual Minds you know but
[1:11:49] just walk with God and let him reveal it
[1:11:51] to you amen but we're not done amen so I
[1:11:54] just like like this strengthen with all
[1:11:56] might according to his glorious power
[1:11:58] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[1:12:00] joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father
[1:12:03] which hath made us meat to be partakers
[1:12:06] of the inheritance of the Saints and
[1:12:07] light who did this for me he
[1:12:10] did you know it's like the great feast
[1:12:13] there in the you know uh Middle East and
[1:12:15] so there in Jesus's day you could be a
[1:12:17] beggar you could be the richest man in
[1:12:18] the country you come in the same door
[1:12:21] you're welcome the same way your feet
[1:12:22] are washed you've given a new robe
[1:12:24] you're anointed kiss made welcome when
[1:12:26] you go through that process you're all
[1:12:27] the same who makes the person meet to
[1:12:30] come into the feast the one who invites
[1:12:32] them it's not the person who comes to
[1:12:34] the door it's the one who's done done
[1:12:35] the invitations that person makes the
[1:12:38] meat to come into the feast amen so it
[1:12:40] doesn't matter where we come from amen
[1:12:42] he's made us meat amen he's to be
[1:12:45] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:12:47] Saints in light who hath delivered us
[1:12:49] from the power of darkness and hath
[1:12:51] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:12:53] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[1:12:56] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:12:57] of sins amen that makes me happy I like
[1:13:00] Colossians it makes me real happy when
[1:13:01] you read what God has done hallelujah
[1:13:03] why because he's delivered us he set us
[1:13:05] free from the powers of Darkness Satan
[1:13:07] has no hold he may try but he has no
[1:13:09] right amen because remember God delivers
[1:13:12] you and then God wants to reveal in you
[1:13:16] yeah What You're Made Of now that's why
[1:13:18] he lets the devil come back amen because
[1:13:20] the show when the Devil comes back and
[1:13:22] he tries to get you once he would Stomp
[1:13:24] all over your life and do what he wanted
[1:13:25] but when he comes back there's now a
[1:13:26] resistance there's no no no there's a
[1:13:28] strong man in the house Satan get away
[1:13:30] from me in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:13:32] once trampled over my life but now I'm

[1:13:38] Christ by the authority of God I'm the
[1:13:39] anointed bride body of Jesus Christ I
[1:13:42] have a right to stomp on your feet I
[1:13:44] mean stomp on your head amen hallelujah
[1:13:46] why cuz he the Lord has delivered us
[1:13:48] that's why we can't Buckle when Satan
[1:13:50] comes against us again Jesus had three
[1:13:53] great Temptations in the wilderness he
[1:13:55] with every one of them by the word of
[1:13:57] God Amen he didn't say you're the first
[1:14:00] one then you then the Devil comes back
[1:14:02] Jesus didn't say oh no I'm under a great
[1:14:03] trial now this is terrible the devil's
[1:14:05] coming against me again no he withstood
[1:14:07] him with the word how many times do we
[1:14:09] get all worried CU just cu the Devil
[1:14:11] comes
[1:14:12] back he's a creature of habit he has no
[1:14:15] new ways he's just he's just a rinse and
[1:14:17] repeat kind of guy copy paste copy paste
[1:14:19] copy paste he's got nothing new okay so
[1:14:22] you should even expect him to come back
[1:14:24] but don't live in fear because the one
[1:14:27] who conquered hell death in the grave
[1:14:28] conquered Calvary conquered everything
[1:14:30] lives in you now greater is he that's in
[1:14:32] you the he that's in the world so don't
[1:14:34] be see we should not be living in fear
[1:14:35] the devil's going to get me devil no
[1:14:37] Jesus already got me amen Jesus already
[1:14:41] got me I'm safe and secure in the Rock
[1:14:43] of Ages the devil can't get me none he
[1:14:46] may trouble my mind he may give me
[1:14:48] sickness he may do all those things but
[1:14:49] he cannot take amen the baptism of the
[1:14:52] Holy Ghost he cannot take eternal life
[1:14:54] out of me amen hallelujah now praise God
[1:14:58] so there's a transformation that takes
[1:14:59] place if you keep walking by
[1:15:02] Revelation amen just keep walking with
[1:15:04] God say God reveal them all to me i'
[1:15:07] sure you know prob the devil says well
[1:15:09] you've heard that before you've read
[1:15:10] that before this probably the sermon you
[1:15:13] may be heard before in a different kind
[1:15:14] of way but God wants to reveal more to
[1:15:17] you you know I remember reading a novel
[1:15:19] that I you read when I was a kid I read
[1:15:21] it again I thought well it's exactly how
[1:15:22] I remembered it put it away you know but
[1:15:25] when you read this word you hear the
[1:15:26] message something always new jumps out
[1:15:28] jumps out because it's God's Eternal
[1:15:29] Word sir now we think of David's Mighty
[1:15:33] Men rough and tough and Gruff and you
[1:15:36] know all these things but many times
[1:15:40] we're always looking at the end picture
[1:15:43] right just like the Bride of Jesus
[1:15:44] Christ we look at the end picture it's
[1:15:45] good to look at the end picture but we
[1:15:47] don't realize that that that these men
[1:15:49] went through a process they went through
[1:15:51] a transformation I mean they did not
[1:15:53] join David in this way they did not join
[1:15:57] David as giant Killers one to one killed
[1:16:00] 800 men in different you know in great
[1:16:03] exploits of Faith No choreographed
[1:16:05] Hollywood scenes here this was one man
[1:16:07] with a sword or a spear killed 800 no
[1:16:09] one else stood with him all these
[1:16:11] incredible things acts of Bravery they
[1:16:13] did not come to David in that condition
[1:16:15] they didn't come in that we got to
[1:16:17] remember this amen they did not come in
[1:16:19] that condition look look at the
[1:16:21] condition they came in David therefore
[1:16:23] departed then and escaped to the Cave of
[1:16:25] uh Cave abdull and when his Brethren and
[1:16:27] all his father's house heard it they
[1:16:29] went down hither to him and everyone
[1:16:31] that was in
[1:16:33] distress now just keep this picture in
[1:16:35] your mind do these guys look in
[1:16:38] distress and everyone that was in debt
[1:16:40] I'm going to flick back and forth do
[1:16:42] these guys look in
[1:16:44] debt and everyone that was
[1:16:46] discontented do they look like that no
[1:16:50] these guys are the Elite of the elite
[1:16:52] these are the SAS of the SAS right here
[1:16:55] you know so they don't look in distress
[1:16:57] there but when they came they were in
[1:17:00] that picture they didn't look like they
[1:17:01] were in debt but when they came they
[1:17:03] were and everyone that was discontented
[1:17:04] they don't look discontented there
[1:17:06] gathered themselves unto him and he
[1:17:08] became a captain over them and there
[1:17:10] were with them about 400 men now now God
[1:17:14] was going to show with these men the
[1:17:16] bride body of Jesus Christ as a as a
[1:17:20] shadow amen he was going to show this is
[1:17:22] what I'm going to do in the end time I'm
[1:17:24] going to gather people
[1:17:26] I'm going to gather people amen they're
[1:17:27] going to come in all different ways
[1:17:28] they're going to come discontented
[1:17:30] brokenhearted troubled all these things
[1:17:32] but I'm going to transform them by the
[1:17:34] anointing of the word amen I'm going to
[1:17:37] transform them to be Mighty Sons and
[1:17:39] Daughters of God I'm going to make them
[1:17:41] Mighty Gentile Warriors amen not ones
[1:17:44] who worry about everything no Warriors
[1:17:46] amen what is a real worrier in this day
[1:17:48] amen someone who takes God at his word
[1:17:50] in spite of everything the devil can
[1:17:51] throw at him Hallelujah so this word
[1:17:54] stress it means to be in a narrow place
[1:17:56] that is a confinement or a disability
[1:17:59] and anguish distress a straightness
[1:18:01] these ones came in maybe may you know
[1:18:03] disability so you think of that as a
[1:18:05] physical disability that they couldn't
[1:18:06] walk right they couldn't talk right we
[1:18:09] were all like this when we came to the
[1:18:10] Lord we couldn't walk right in this
[1:18:11] world we were walking like this going
[1:18:13] after every shiny thing I mean that the
[1:18:15] flesh wanted you know we couldn't think
[1:18:17] right we had trouble we were you know
[1:18:19] this is how they came amen and then
[1:18:21] those who are discontented they were
[1:18:23] bitter yeah they weren't smiling coming
[1:18:26] to the cave of abdull hey David I I hear
[1:18:29] you coming into Power I'm here to join
[1:18:30] you no they were bitter they were angry
[1:18:33] they had bitterness they were chafe
[1:18:34] things were rubbing them their lives
[1:18:35] they had trouble they were discontented
[1:18:37] they were they were heavy they had all
[1:18:39] these kind of things going on but they
[1:18:41] didn't stay that way I mean God was
[1:18:44] going God gathered them to show what
[1:18:45] he's going to do as a mighty Army in
[1:18:47] this end time I'm actually looking I
[1:18:50] don't I don't know if you realize it but
[1:18:51] that's
[1:18:53] you you say well I can't really grow
[1:18:55] facial here like that I'm an Apache I
[1:18:57] can't do it no but that's
[1:18:59] you Hallelujah even the we'll leave
[1:19:03] there anyway you see but that's your
[1:19:05] photo that's like class photo of
[1:19:07] 2024 right there Mighty Mighty Warriors
[1:19:11] amen but you see the reason they became
[1:19:13] that way is because they are beholding
[1:19:15] an image just like our opening scripture
[1:19:17] they are beholding a king coming into
[1:19:19] Power th are beholding an anointed Son
[1:19:22] of God that was anointed by a Vindicator
[1:19:24] Prophet amen that there's a prophecy
[1:19:26] over his life you're going to be on the
[1:19:28] throne of Israel amen so they were
[1:19:29] beholding this image amen when they were
[1:19:31] following David around and then the
[1:19:33] anointing that was on David now came
[1:19:35] onto them amen because the same
[1:19:37] anointing David used to kill a lion and
[1:19:39] a bear and a you know Giant and all
[1:19:41] these things amen was the same anointing
[1:19:43] came on them and they did Mighty
[1:19:44] exploits of Faith am mean three of them
[1:19:47] cut through 15 miles of Philistines to
[1:19:48] get David a drink I mean you think about
[1:19:50] the odds of those things how on Earth
[1:19:52] could that be am mean naturally you
[1:19:54] think three men like I think even in war
[1:19:56] these days you know there's a Doctrine
[1:19:58] when you're attacking a enemy force in
[1:20:00] order to win you you have to outnumber
[1:20:02] them 3: one that's what they say to have
[1:20:05] a successful assault on an enemy
[1:20:06] position you got to outnumber them 3 to
[1:20:08] one now three of these guys fought
[1:20:12] through 15 miles of men I think the
[1:20:15] scales are a bit different than a 3 to1
[1:20:18] success ratio but the thing is they did
[1:20:20] not look at the odds they looked at the
[1:20:22] anointing they looked at the promised
[1:20:24] word they weren't looking about odds who
[1:20:26] cares about odds see the odds were
[1:20:28] against us even to come
[1:20:30] here even our natural lineage you think
[1:20:32] there were great plagues Wars famines
[1:20:34] troubles against our forebears but yet
[1:20:36] we made it amen there was the the devil
[1:20:39] would have killed us all if he could
[1:20:40] have but we made it see the devil don't
[1:20:43] have enough to stop you fulfilling God's
[1:20:45] plan in your life our Lord Brother Bram
[1:20:49] said that nothing can take you from this
[1:20:50] life until your purpose is fulfilled
[1:20:52] nothing amen so we're going to realiz
[1:20:55] that you know we we we are here
[1:20:58] supernaturally amen so these ones
[1:20:59] weren't looking at odds they were
[1:21:01] looking at the promise word of their day
[1:21:03] and what happened is that same anointing
[1:21:05] came onto them they went through a
[1:21:08] transformation amen they weren't from
[1:21:10] you know they went from discontented
[1:21:11] people in debt Amen in distress to
[1:21:14] Mighty Gentile Warriors amen when they
[1:21:17] stood there and slew hundreds by
[1:21:18] themselves they weren't in distress they
[1:21:21] knew my God will fight for me amen I
[1:21:23] know the David's coming into Power am
[1:21:26] mean I know the anointing is on him and
[1:21:27] now that anointing is upon me they did
[1:21:29] Mighty exploits of faith and we know
[1:21:31] this word is coming into power we know
[1:21:34] Jesus is going to sit on the throne of
[1:21:35] David in the Millennium amen
[1:21:37] irrespective of what's going on in the
[1:21:39] world what trouble strife and whatever's
[1:21:42] hashtagging trending on the internet we
[1:21:44] know he's coming into Power amen and
[1:21:46] that same anointing that's on this
[1:21:47] message comes into us hallelujah and we
[1:21:51] realize that we are the bride body of
[1:21:54] Jesus Christ
[1:21:55] Hallelujah why because we begin to see
[1:21:57] see even even the everyday Christian
[1:21:59] Life we live it's an incredible thing am
[1:22:03] mean to go to school and still be a
[1:22:04] believer is an incredible thing am mean
[1:22:06] to go through that big mess of peer
[1:22:08] pressure amen is incredible thing that's
[1:22:11] an incredible thing you say God's not
[1:22:13] doing anything in my life but you still
[1:22:15] beli well you say well I got a lot of
[1:22:17] Mind battles the reason you got mind
[1:22:18] battles is the devil's trying to get a
[1:22:19] hold of you but something in you is
[1:22:20] saying
[1:22:22] no hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[1:22:24] resistance there that's good amen praise
[1:22:28] the Lord so this everyday Christian Life
[1:22:30] we live is in the face of everything the
[1:22:32] devil's built to try and get our
[1:22:34] attention but the Lord has done a work
[1:22:36] in our lives that we don't want what he
[1:22:39] has that's right cuz we know our King is
[1:22:42] coming into Power amen amen praise the
[1:22:45] Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:49] amen praise God now where am I going
[1:22:51] here
[1:22:53] see
[1:22:56] Faith takes care of everything yes sir
[1:23:00] brother says in my house I'm just going
[1:23:02] back to the thought of we're not here to
[1:23:03] convert anyone to the government of
[1:23:05] Christianity but it's by Revelation see
[1:23:08] you try to tell them what they must stop
[1:23:09] doing see and say well I must do this
[1:23:12] and that or the other no you see that
[1:23:14] isn't the question what must I do not
[1:23:18] what must I stop doing amen but you just
[1:23:21] do what you're supposed to do and all
[1:23:23] the rest of it will take care of it
[1:23:24] itself you're lying stealing drinking
[1:23:27] gambling and doing the things that's
[1:23:28] evil it'll stop when you do what Paul
[1:23:30] answered his question what must I do to
[1:23:33] be saved he said believe on the Lord
[1:23:34] Jesus Christ and thine and thy house
[1:23:37] shall be saved amen so many times we say
[1:23:40] stop do stop doing this this is wrong
[1:23:42] and that and that may be all true but
[1:23:44] what's the remedy is faith in the Lord
[1:23:46] Jesus Christ I mean when Faith goes to
[1:23:49] work when you became a Believer let's
[1:23:51] just go down memory lane yeah yeah yeah
[1:23:53] amen amen am I drank I stole I lied I
[1:23:57] did all kinds of evil things but when
[1:23:59] Faith came in and Faith cometh by
[1:24:01] hearing and hearing the word of God all
[1:24:03] those things left me I didn't have to go
[1:24:05] through an AA thing or a um you know go
[1:24:08] on some Monastery and pray and have some
[1:24:10] mindfulness season and all this kind of
[1:24:12] stuff to try and suppress things that
[1:24:15] now I'm a Christian no when faith comes
[1:24:17] in unbelief goes out amen that's why
[1:24:19] it's so important we encourage believe
[1:24:21] on the Lord Jesus Christ we say well I'm
[1:24:23] going through some trouble believe
[1:24:24] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ my
[1:24:26] family's gone away with believe on the
[1:24:27] Lord Jesus Christ I need a job believe
[1:24:29] on the Lord Jesus Christ you know I need
[1:24:31] all this besetting sin of My Life
[1:24:33] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ let
[1:24:35] Faith come in let Revelation come in and
[1:24:37] that will take care of
[1:24:39] everything maybe that's too simple for
[1:24:42] some people but I'm simple and I like it
[1:24:43] amen cuz Faith moves mountains amen
[1:24:46] Faith creates an atmosphere of love amen
[1:24:48] Faith brings Deliverance amen Faith
[1:24:50] brings the promises of God and manifests
[1:24:52] them amen Faith brings resur ction amen

[1:26:25] thoughts it's not your word it's his
[1:26:26] word it's not your desire it's his
[1:26:28] desire amen it's him living through his
[1:26:31] body Hallelujah see well I don't know if

[1:26:50] would rather just push it you know
[1:26:51] there's not no this is surrendered to
[1:26:53] this yeah right and if we are
[1:26:55] surrendered to him if we're surrendered
[1:26:58] to him it's not our thoughts it's just
[1:27:00] his word living through US amen
[1:27:02] hallelujah see if we could ever get the
[1:27:04] scare out of the people that something
[1:27:05] oh I don't know what you're uh what
[1:27:07] you're wanting a little touch me or
[1:27:09] hocus po Pocus see God's word is your
[1:27:11] Basics God say so just laid out there
[1:27:13] perfect that's where we believe it see
[1:27:15] it's not nothing oh if I can just do
[1:27:18] this or that it's not what you what you
[1:27:20] done it's what God has done for you
[1:27:23] that's why I read that in Colossians is
[1:27:25] what he has already done amen so the
[1:27:27] devil wrestles with you saying is it
[1:27:29] really for you is it not forget his lies
[1:27:32] and say God's already done it for me you
[1:27:35] confess it and walk into that
[1:27:37] confession amen you got to believe
[1:27:38] you're saved you got to say yes Lord
[1:27:40] You're My Savior then what he saves you
[1:27:42] see many times we say Lord can you do it
[1:27:44] he already has done it he can only act
[1:27:46] on our profession our confession so if
[1:27:48] you confess you'll never get anywhere
[1:27:50] with God you'll stay there right but if
[1:27:52] you confess Lord you're more than able
[1:27:54] Lord you put your life within me to
[1:27:56] transform me into your word you'll do it
[1:27:58] he'll do it amen there power and
[1:28:01] confession God has given you the ability
[1:28:03] to speak his word amen now see
[1:28:08] amen okay it's what God has done for you
[1:28:10] it's people say oh if I can just keep
[1:28:12] holding on it ain't you holding on it's
[1:28:14] whether he held on or not he held on
[1:28:17] that day on Calvary he held on
[1:28:19] hallelujah praise the Lord amen it's
[1:28:22] whether he it ain't what I am it's what
[1:28:24] he is what he represented me as God
[1:28:27] don't see me as I am if I'm in Christ he
[1:28:29] sees Christ he don't see me no more for
[1:28:32] I'm dead my life is hidden him sealed by
[1:28:34] the Holy Ghost covered by the blood you
[1:28:36] get that then God takes the faith that
[1:28:38] Abraham had and place plac it in every
[1:28:40] Believer by the Holy Spirit you get it
[1:28:42] then you begin to believe all things
[1:28:44] hope all things that's when the gospel
[1:28:45] goes to work in the heart what you
[1:28:47] believe you begin to believe and hope
[1:28:50] and that hope is an expectation you have
[1:28:51] an expectation that all things in God's
[1:28:53] word he's going to fulfill amen that's
[1:28:55] how you know that God's done a work in
[1:28:56] your heart you can believe for the
[1:28:58] impossible irrespective of what you're
[1:29:00] seeing in your life right now you can
[1:29:01] take God's word say God you're more than
[1:29:03] able to do it praise the Lord amen see
[1:29:05] you believe all things now why
[1:29:08] see before I became a Christian I was a
[1:29:11] skeptic but then when he met me I said
[1:29:13] well if God can save me he can save
[1:29:15] everyone well I begin to believe for all
[1:29:17] things amen you say and and and that's
[1:29:20] how we should be with every circumstance
[1:29:21] I'm sick but God's my healer amen I may
[1:29:24] yeah I need this or whatever but God can
[1:29:26] supply it amen amen my family's this or
[1:29:29] whatever no but God's more than
[1:29:31] able amen that's why it's so important
[1:29:33] now because the anointed bride body
[1:29:36] Jesus Christ that lives by revelation we
[1:29:38] live by the word amen amen we don't live
[1:29:40] by Church politics we don't live by
[1:29:42] religious politics trying to be better
[1:29:43] than the next family or this family that
[1:29:45] family no we live by the word of God all
[1:29:48] of us are sovereign sovereignly LED
[1:29:50] according to the word of God Amen and we
[1:29:52] live by the word and if we live live by
[1:29:54] the word amen God will manifest that
[1:29:56] word now that's not you trying to
[1:29:58] produce it that's you surrendering to
[1:30:00] the word if you want to live by the word
[1:30:02] surrendered to the word I mean you take
[1:30:04] Elijah he surrendered to the vision that
[1:30:06] God gave him of what would happen on
[1:30:08] Mount carel he surrendered to it and he
[1:30:10] fulfilled it amen because before the
[1:30:12] fire fell he said Lord I've done all
[1:30:14] this according to Thy word may now the
[1:30:16] people know you are God and you've
[1:30:17] turned their hearts back again so he saw
[1:30:20] it as a vision and then he lived out
[1:30:22] that vision and then God fulfilled the
[1:30:24] vision that's why the thing is when it's
[1:30:26] Quicken to repent be baptized in the
[1:30:28] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:30:29] of sin you shall receive the gift of the
[1:30:31] Holy Ghost when that becomes a reality
[1:30:33] to you you walk in it you receive the
[1:30:35] Holy Ghost amen why you surrender
[1:30:37] yourself to the vision of God amen amen
[1:30:41] hallelujah and that's what the word is
[1:30:42] you you you surrender to it and let it
[1:30:45] live amen and that's why it's so
[1:30:47] important that we stay with the word all
[1:30:50] right you take because God only backs up
[1:30:53] his word now this this is this is
[1:30:54] Micaiah here um with the 400 prophets
[1:30:57] and the two kings one's Ahab by this
[1:30:59] stage there's already been a prophecy
[1:31:01] come from Elijah saying that Micaiah I
[1:31:02] mean that sorry ahab's ahab's blood is
[1:31:05] going to be lick by dogs he's going to
[1:31:06] die in battle amen but they had 400
[1:31:09] prophets there saying that they're going
[1:31:10] to win they're going to take ramoth
[1:31:12] Gilead they're going to have Victory who
[1:31:13] knows the story amen but but I think
[1:31:15] it's Jehoshaphat the righteous King said
[1:31:17] but yeah sure you got 400 sure that was
[1:31:19] a great meeting there's a mighty stir
[1:31:21] going on there seemed very Supernatural
[1:31:23] but do you have one more prophet and I
[1:31:25] yeah yeah I just imagine Ahab maybe a
[1:31:27] delayed reaction crosses his arms looks
[1:31:29] at him saying just thinking
[1:31:31] what yeah I have one more but I hate him
[1:31:34] I mean he hates me he always preaches
[1:31:36] evil against me you know Micaiah son of
[1:31:38] IM Jehoshaphat said let's get him too so
[1:31:42] now here comes here comes uh you know
[1:31:45] the delegates come maybe maybe some of
[1:31:47] the head deacons or whatever they come
[1:31:48] down to Mah and say now now listen
[1:31:51] you've caused trouble in church why did
[1:31:53] he caused trouble because Ahab had
[1:31:56] Christianity according to a
[1:31:57] government right but Micaiah had
[1:32:00] Revelation and so now here comes Micaiah
[1:32:03] and these delegates are try to tell him
[1:32:05] listen this is what we prophesied you
[1:32:06] should have seen the head of the
[1:32:08] organization the head Pastor he made
[1:32:10] these two horns and Manny God enthusi
[1:32:12] running the aisles they're going to push
[1:32:13] them out of the country all these things
[1:32:15] you just say what has been said because
[1:32:17] it was
[1:32:18] God therefore amen you can come back
[1:32:22] into fellowship and then mAh said I will
[1:32:24] only say what God has put in my mouth
[1:32:27] and so that night he prayed he had a
[1:32:28] vision amen of what would happen in the
[1:32:30] battle but he took that vision and
[1:32:32] subjected to the prophecy that was
[1:32:33] already given see the devil always try
[1:32:36] and get us off the line with different
[1:32:37] things amen but no and so that's why he
[1:32:39] could stand in front of the Kings and
[1:32:42] say I see Israel scattered without a
[1:32:45] shepherd and they begin to say about how
[1:32:47] there was a lying Spirit came up before
[1:32:49] God and said oh I will get them to
[1:32:50] believe me and he anointed them and
[1:32:53] because the reason reason is those 400
[1:32:54] prophets they didn't stay with the word
[1:32:56] see amen but because Micaiah was part of
[1:32:59] the Bride body of Jesus Christ if I put
[1:33:01] it that way he stayed with the word of
[1:33:03] God Amen and what happened is because he
[1:33:06] lived by the word amen the word was
[1:33:09] fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah but you
[1:33:11] see now here's a big problem maybe this
[1:33:13] is a whole different thought but I'm
[1:33:14] just going to throw it in the end here
[1:33:16] now Satan if he cannot get you to
[1:33:18] disbelieve the word to try and get you
[1:33:20] to see he'll try and get you to get
[1:33:22] people to conform to the the government
[1:33:24] of
[1:33:25] Christianity he'll get you to try and
[1:33:27] get off from walking in Revelation and
[1:33:29] try and get people to conform to the
[1:33:31] government don't do this do this stop
[1:33:33] this this is how things should be all
[1:33:34] these things instead of letting God
[1:33:35] reveal himself to people right if he
[1:33:37] can't do that then he will make you a
[1:33:39] supernatural offer he'll make you a
[1:33:42] supernatural offer to try and get you to
[1:33:44] disbelieve the
[1:33:45] word then he makes you a supernatural
[1:33:48] offer I'm going to come back to all this
[1:33:50] just in closing see he if he can't tempt
[1:33:52] you away from the word no I'm I'm going
[1:33:53] to stay with the word then he'll give
[1:33:55] you a supernatural offer he said I'll
[1:33:57] tell you what you get up here and dive
[1:33:58] off the temple and and and and bring
[1:34:01] back up see show the people that that
[1:34:03] you can do something
[1:34:05] supernaturally this is what he'll try
[1:34:07] and do but boy he got them there now
[1:34:09] watch this watch this watch when you get
[1:34:11] to the end where this temptation come
[1:34:13] maybe he might let you speak in tongues
[1:34:16] think you got it see or he might let you
[1:34:18] prophesy though it not be with the word
[1:34:20] I've seen people stand up and prophesy
[1:34:22] was contrary to the word as East is from
[1:34:24] the West see it's the word that you live
[1:34:26] by them Supernatural gifts Satan can
[1:34:28] just hand them out by handful certainly
[1:34:30] it don't mean one thing now I'm not
[1:34:33] against gifts I'm sure you've heard me
[1:34:35] long enough to understand that but thing
[1:34:37] is he will give you a supernatural offer
[1:34:39] as long as it takes you off the word of
[1:34:41] God so it doesn't matter how
[1:34:43] Supernatural something is it's got to
[1:34:44] line up with the word and the anointed
[1:34:47] bride body of Jesus Christ only lives by
[1:34:49] the word amen the the devil try and give
[1:34:51] you all kinds of promises all kind of
[1:34:53] things see he says I'll even let you
[1:34:56] I'll let you do this I'll let you speak
[1:34:58] in tongues I'll let you prophesy but it
[1:35:00] will be contrary to the word and Satan
[1:35:03] can hand them out by the handful see
[1:35:05] this is why we've just got to live a
[1:35:06] simple Christian Life and let God live
[1:35:10] however he wants to manifest himself we
[1:35:12] know we're living in the season of the
[1:35:13] spoken word I me we know we're living a
[1:35:16] time when the gifts are restored and we
[1:35:17] see the gifts now in here we understand
[1:35:20] the moving of the Holy Spirit we see all
[1:35:22] those things here but don't ever get off
[1:35:24] of a line where you think that the a a a
[1:35:26] supernatural move of God if it's
[1:35:28] contrary to the word is something you
[1:35:29] should stay with you know someone said
[1:35:31] to me ages ago well you've just got to
[1:35:33] experiment with the gifts no one here
[1:35:35] you got to experiment then you can
[1:35:36] finally get in how it actually works to
[1:35:38] me that is deadly you don't experi you
[1:35:41] don't experience anything with a with a
[1:35:43] spirit you got to take it back to the
[1:35:45] word of God it's got to be Lord cover me
[1:35:47] in your blood if you want to speak
[1:35:49] through me cover me in your blood Lord
[1:35:52] you speak if you want me to prophesy may
[1:35:54] it not be Lord cover me in your blood
[1:35:56] may it be you speaking I don't want to
[1:35:57] speak a lie I don't want to damage the
[1:35:59] body of Jesus Christ I don't want to
[1:36:01] preach something that's contrary to your
[1:36:03] word Lord I must stay with your word
[1:36:05] Lord because this the bride body of
[1:36:07] Jesus Christ lives by the word the Holy
[1:36:09] Ghost within us lives by the word amen
[1:36:11] we can't go deviate of into something
[1:36:13] else we must stay exactly amen with the
[1:36:16] word of godj Hallelujah how on because
[1:36:19] that's how the devil will try and deform
[1:36:20] someone by bringing something in
[1:36:22] contrary to the word of God but friends
[1:36:24] all we need to do see
[1:36:28] God the veils come off the word the
[1:36:31] seals have come off the book am mean
[1:36:33] Christ is unveiled in this day all we
[1:36:35] need to do is behold the word in prayer
[1:36:37] listen to it read absorb it think about
[1:36:40] it pray and let him change you to match
[1:36:44] his word amen I think we got to Behold
[1:36:46] The Right image the Mighty Men beheld
[1:36:48] David and became Gentile Mighty Gentile
[1:36:52] worriors Anointed with the same
[1:36:53] anointing the apostles beheld Jesus this
[1:36:56] is why Jesus took them through
[1:36:57] incredible experiences not just to prove
[1:37:00] who he was but to get them to see I'm
[1:37:03] going to take you through these things
[1:37:04] that when I in you these same things
[1:37:06] will happen in your life amen it's the
[1:37:08] same thing that's why brother Braham was
[1:37:10] used in this end time to demonstrate God
[1:37:13] would use him to demonstrate the power
[1:37:14] of the Cross and to show what a redeemed
[1:37:17] son is capable of fully surrendered to
[1:37:19] God not just that we're look at it say
[1:37:21] that's a neat thing but it say God he
[1:37:23] showed us that to show us what the body
[1:37:25] of Jesus Christ is going to become amen
[1:37:27] and friends I believe we're
[1:37:29] there I I believe we're not becoming we
[1:37:32] have become but we need to realize what
[1:37:35] we are right now that because now we are
[1:37:36] the sons and daughters of God not one
[1:37:38] day now we are why are you part the body
[1:37:40] of Christ because you born into it why
[1:37:43] were you born into it because you're a
[1:37:44] child of God I mean you didn't join it
[1:37:46] you were born into it hallelujah amen
[1:37:50] praise the Lord let's just finish this
[1:37:51] shall we amen let's have the musicians

[1:37:55] morning amen he say it's quite a change
[1:37:59] well you went from Darkness into life
[1:38:02] you went from Lost to found that's a
[1:38:03] change that's a real
[1:38:05] transformation amen you're once
[1:38:07] alienated from God now you're living his
[1:38:09] presence that's a
[1:38:11] transformation praise the Lord amen so
[1:38:15] let us let him let us let him transform
[1:38:18] us into His Image more and more amen
[1:38:20] we'll come to this thought maybe another
[1:38:22] time but you know
[1:38:24] praise the
[1:38:25] Lord amen faith is a revelation walk in
[1:38:29] that Revelation let them unfold more to
[1:38:31] you amen now praise the Lord let's
[1:38:37] um how many times do we look at our
[1:38:39] children and think what's in
[1:38:41] them do you ever look at your kids and
[1:38:43] say I wonder what's in them what's
[1:38:46] what's really in them I doubt very much
[1:38:49] Einstein's parents had an idea what he
[1:38:51] was what was within them but it came out
[1:38:54] amen so I pray we treat our children say
[1:38:57] Lord there's a gift in their life
[1:38:59] there's a part of you in there may we
[1:39:01] raise them that that comes to life amen
[1:39:04] that they know what it's like to
[1:39:05] surrender to the word of God let God
[1:39:06] live through them hallelujah
[1:39:09] amen praise the Lord let's stand amen uh
[1:39:12] this
[1:39:14] morning amen let's

[1:39:32] amen amen you're fighting a battle he's
[1:39:34] already won amen remember brother Daryl
[1:39:37] Ward saying it in up at the convention
[1:39:39] you know he he was part of the United
[1:39:41] States Army they gave him the best
[1:39:42] training and equipment that was on the
[1:39:44] planet but one thing they could not give
[1:39:45] him was promise of Victory we have the
[1:39:48] promise of Victory you know the devil
[1:39:51] fights he knows he's going to win but he
[1:39:52] fights like he's going to win and many
[1:39:54] times we fight knowing we're going to
[1:39:56] win but we're going to lose if that
