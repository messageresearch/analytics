some sick people Amen baby I can see it coming all right being with me I hadn't planned to see this but I just listened to the song I got is tremendous I thought man I got is so tremendous and and so I thought I was really want to share it because then I was encouraged so much as weakened and I just I pray that it encourages you guys so bear with me all right so Rebecca in the girl's head of violin week in so we went away to up to Hamilton and um the teacher said to me okay we need to have one health and safety person like a first-aid person I said okay well my certificate probably expired 10 years ago but if you don't need it to be current but I can deal with anything as fine so she said oh yeah perfect you got the job so that's fine so 35 children and like just a couple of us adults and so we wind up there we got to them at I and and we unpacked everything all the children win and they started practicing their violins and then one of the boys sort of like stumbles out he put his violin away and he's stumbling out of the room so I thought okay what's going on here I don't know he's fine he's fine he's fine he says so then he goes in to have dinner and he gets his plate puts his food on his plate and in some things he's walking and he can't walk straight and it's all slipping off onto the floor so he puts it down on the table goes back up gets another plate and then puts more food on same thing can't even walk leaning against the wall falling off and then his brother comes helps them puts it up so he goes to another table forgets all about his other plate doesn't know what's going on and he's sitting there and aspires are all why do that water would I need water I need water yes so I thought what on earth has gone because I don't know these children very well but I know I've never seen him like this before so so he goes up and he's drinking all of us water it can't even stand up straight so I said okay come come with me let's go and sit down and he I said okay what did you eat on the bus I don't know doesn't know what day does doesn't know areas doesn't know what's going on at all so that okay Lord that I just wonderful being in Christian because you don't have to worry about anything I had such a deep down wrist although I thought okay this is very bad I had that deep breast like it it's okay and so I said to the teacher if we don't if we don't have a quick car here I have to call the ambulance and I want to take him to the A&E and so she said no no someone has a car so he jumped in and on the way to the car I said can I pray for you and he said no everything's everything's going to be okay and there's sort of delirious state Amenas brother having to hold him up and I thought yes I said yes you're right everything is gonna be okay so I just put my hands on his shoulders I thought no the lord has us in control everything's going to be fine so we went to the A&E and while we were sitting there I'm cutting a long story quite a bit short of it while we're sitting there waiting and it was full of babies screaming and everything about seven o'clock and um so we're sitting there waiting and while we're sitting there he just goes limp and his eyes rolled back in his head so he had a bit of a seizure and so I thought okay so quickly he went and got the nurse to come over they took us into a room and just gave him some medication and he just went straight to sleep so that okay all right and um so his older brother and I sitting there he's 17 his parents aren't there or anything you know but I knew the Lord was there with us the whole time and um and so they were so busy so they didn't really weren't really able to see us much at all and they didn't really know what was going on so I was able to talk to his brother and I spoke to him quite a lot they are very sincere Filipino Catholic Christians and so he he talked to me quite a lot it was quite a shy boy and so we were able to spend quite a bit of time talking about just testimonies and just the Lord and it was really really sweet and um and he was quite receptive and open and and it was interesting because just as we finished talking his brother woke up and and he was like a different boy just as I finished sharing testimony with him about fully surrendering your life to the Lord and Andy's testimony in these things and um and I knew but I knew I had to say this one thing but it just hadn't come up about fully surrendering but as soon as I seen it pretty much just then brother woke up and um and he was where and why what's going on I didn't remove anything from after the violin with dinner he didn't mean anything from the until now but then he was like normal he's like oh can we go what are you doing here you know and it was really odd so the doctors came back and they said they were had put all the patches on to take blood tests and they said okay yeah he seems completely normal just wait a bit yeah well probably we don't really know what to do and and so they kept they and in this time I thought because it's been hours it's all it was almost midnight so I'm sitting and I had my Bible in my bag and I was just reading and I'm and I just I was reading actually I started reading from Matthew 24 and I think it's at the end of 25 it says if you've done it to the least of these you've done it unto me and I just felt so privileged I thought that it could be the Lord you know there cuz his brother was saying people don't do this like say thank you so much he said this means so much to me this means so much to my family that you would come and look after my brother like this you know he was blown away he said people people don't do this and so when I read that you know if you do it unto the least of these you doing it unto me so and then and then you have a doctor and I I'm actually I had a migraine the night before and I'd had to go to bed early and ahead sort of that residual bit so I hid the whole day but just been ignoring it but the migraines started to come back and I said to her Lord okay I probably can it because the guy had said okay because he's had a little bit of a seizure we'll need to keep him overnight for monitoring and I knew that that meant that I needed to stay overnight with him so I said to the Lord okay please you have to take away this migraine because I started to feel nauseous and that same type of thing so I said to the lord please take away this migraine so that I can look after him because I know I'm doing this for you and I mean just something seen in my heart you'll be out of here by midnight I looked at the clock and it was five to twelve okay thank you lord that's really really awesome IPPT of this and like I looked outside screaming children everything everywhere and I thought okay doesn't seem possible but we'll just wait and just waited and then yeah but the and they were so busy and with all these horrible things that had happened and in this doctor walked and he said okay I've talked to my consultant and he says because you just out of two minutes down the road you can just monitor and wake in the night wake him check everything's fine in the night sit with him if he sleeps next to you you know then it's fine to go and I thought then that does not happen there does not happen and I decide takes the lady at the place I says okay all as well come and pick me up I looked at the text it was 11:59 thank you lord and so just one more quick thing I set with him the whole next day and it's how the Lord actually had it like he obviously had an infection and his temperature was so high that he was delirious and started her hallucinating and seeing stuff in it but in the next day we just kept on top of the pen and oh and things and they kept temperatures stay down but the Lord just he'd seen everything seeing this lady with just the right medicine to help his immunity and build him up and I sit with him in this little room he slipped pretty much the whole day the next day and I was able to just sit there and this quiet little room called the prayer room at this church you know I just have my Bible and I read the Bible pretty much the whole day and people are like are you okay we feel so sorry for you I might know man this is awesome and I just reading about how the all the commandments are summed up in it and at the end of Galatians 5 and it just says and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and I just I've always been what Shannon said is a homeschool motto this is our homeschool philosophy love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself and I thought man that's our philosophy a just expressed love to this hurting world so yeah you can pray for that boy

amen thank you brother John thank you musicians Amy good morning everyone god bless you all trusty ones well today I mean it's great to have you on here then we're gonna go to Ephesians its exodus 11 6 & 7 it's gonna read to two verses here and then we're gonna go to Ephesians chapter 6 so XS 11 chapter Exodus chapter 11 verses 6 & 7 this is just before they are going to have the Passover and they're going to take the lamb apply the blood as the last plague death is about to strike Egypt and this is Moses speaking and he says and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there were none like it nor shall be like it any more but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the Lord hath put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel they say how the Lord hath put a difference is a big and there's a difference today between the believer in the rest of the world right God's going to put a difference and when we go to Ephesians chapter 6 now just into the New Testament he says you're in Ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God we may be able to able to withstand in the evil day and we live in an evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore do not buckle stand having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning I want to continue on I'm just been reading through the scripture and uh last week we talked about Joseph's taking a Gentile bride now I want to talk about well Christianity real Christianity is God into people that's why he died on Calvary that's why you know he shed his life's blood to bridge the chasm between him your God and man that God would take man who was born with a fallen sin nature and would transform that man that they no longer had that fall in sin nature but they received God's nature and God would come and dwell in that man that's the reason that he died is it not Christianity is not just another religion and another nice idea a way of life you know it's more than a moral code or this is not a book of ethics this is this is a this is God revealed right and Christianity now is that the life of the believer is the interpretation of the scripture so when people see you they should bevel and they ask what do you believe you should say just what's my life watch how I treat my family watch how I treat others watch how I you know how I worship God watch how I dress what's what I say was what I do that is the interpretation of the scripture right so it's more than an argument or some ideas it's a life on display amen and then now I bet I want to say this now the devil is also religious he was religious from the beginning for you know because since started in heaven he says I'll make myself like the Most High I'll be worshipped that was his desire I want to be in God I want worship and and he was cast out of heaven and the angels that believed his lie they were cast out and now they're upon the earth and he wants worship from man because God wants worship from man he wants a relationship with man because God wants relationship with man right so the devil's religious as well and we know from the scripture that the and from history that the Egyptians were religious people that would honor an atheistic people their whole life their whole life was revolved around gods and the Pharaoh himself considered himself a god and he was considered the yo that's he is considered the car brother he was the god he was a god and that's why the first thing Moses did as he had the stuff and he cast it down it became a serpent he picked it back up and became a stuff and and God was telling the devil I can loose you I can bind you I can loose you I can bind you I have control in this place there's what God was telling the devil and so and but there are religious people they worshiped they had their temples they had their theology they had their sacred writings but God is saying I'm going to make a difference between you and them and it must be the same thing today there must be a difference between the real believer and the professing believer right there must be a real difference between them who really know their God and those who are merely just a religious people I mean so we need to look into these things because I trust you have not come here just for a religion I trust you ever come here just to well it's a Sunday morning and you know it's in my culture I come to church I am you know I believe the Bible out of tradition and that's going to be more than that I trust you've come because I am redeemed by the blood of the lamb his blood has become effective in my life I'm a cleansed I'm a separated transformed believer I mean I've come to give him worship I trust that's why you here this morning it should be that's the reason Alleluia I don't I don't serve God because you know my parents had and you know see if they were Christians I don't see them because of that i7 because I made him he came out of history and made me oh yeah and so now the difference there and in an exodus was they're about to apply the blood of the Lamb he says I'm going to put this difference between you and the Egyptians you're going to take a lamb you're gonna slay that lamb and you're going to put the blood on the door and lentil and this will be the difference between you and the Egyptians oh yeah and not only that they had to take that lamb thank the rooster with bitter herbs they had to eat the whole thing they couldn't just have the you know the nice parts of the word I mean they had to take the whole whole word the whole council they had to become one with it they had to ingest it not just look at all isn't this such a nice cut of lamb and isn't it so wonderful and all this is such a plump fellow and you know it's going to be nice and just talk about how good it is they had to eat it there to become one with their sacrifice they couldn't just put it on the shelf or hit leave the blood you know just enough in a picture of whatever bothered or they had to apply it they had to follow the instructions of the vindicated prophet of the day right and not now the devil would try and whisper to them it's not really that important you know your father was Abraham that's good enough you're circumcised I meant circumcision didn't do any good at that point they could have been circumcised if they didn't apply the blood they would have died the angel would have struck them the only reason that the death angel did not strike them was because the blood was applied hallelujah and is the same thing they had good men good morrow people were in Israel right good morrow people religious people it wouldn't have just been you know there would have been many crying out for the deliverer to come although when will you fulfill your word in my day many good moral people their Levites were there all different kinds of people there they had to apply the blood and if they failed they were the first one would have died right and we must apply the blood and our token today is not the blood of a lamb it's the life that was in Jesus Christ that was released on Calvary comes unto you right because I could have a vial of his blood and the shirt would be precious but just be a relic God doesn't want us to make relics out of anything the life that was in our Lord Jesus must come in you and if it's coming to you and it lives through you you have the target on display and if then when the death angel strikes the world which he is he'll pass over you your safe is safe can be that is the difference right and it's more than just being anointed because jesus said in this last days many false Christ's many false Christ's would arise and deceive many Christ means Anointed One so you can be anointed and still be a devil you can still be anointed you can be anointing to still be unconverted rights you're going to be more than just other men are such a wonderful atmosphere what happens when you leave church whatever is from from about winner on Sunday afternoon tool if you come on Wednesday if you come next Sunday what's your life in the between time because we can be caught up in an atmosphere and we can worship but we have a wonderful time and we can rejoice and those things are all real but it's got to have a permanent change that's the difference as a permanent life it's not just you're here and rejoicing your life was a worship I mean how you respond to each other how you dress what the things you watch the things you do it's a worship David said I'll not let any evil before my face amen I think that's a good way to live that's the problem with the societies they let Hollywood pour a bunch of filth on their necks and they take it because that's preaching to you you know that I mean the music people isn't do the things that watch that's a sermon and these emissions have slipped into that and it changes people's thinking and how you know how they look at life and the people just wallow in it isn't this wonderful and being entertained isn't this glorious and they're being totally twisted up I mean that's why Irene you got to put on the whole armor of God the armor is not a natural armor it's a stripper net right it's the anointing of God in your life see abiding prisons of Jesus Christ probably that's what you've got to have no understand without him in the stage it's just that simple you're either equipped for the battle were you just a sitting duck on the battlefield who would go to war without a weapon I know you talked about this in Sunday school but here we are you know who would go you know without a weapon and would we go to war with some antique musket would we put on some red coats like the British stood you know 200 years ago and line up pull them up fix bayonets oh we're gonna win no we'd get massacred we'd get massacred you can't equip yourself with Luther's message I mean that's not even a musket you can't equip yourself just with Wiz Lee's message that's antiquated warfare it worked in their day the musket worked at Waterloo it won't work today right the tactics they used at Waterloo that defeated Napoleon that worked then they tried those tactics in World War one you ever started World War one they went over the trench they marched towards the enemy's trench that's the initial stages of the war they were mourned down by machine-gun fire they don't have machine guns and water you know in Napoleon's day but then they ate that you know then they change their tactics they didn't just walk they were running they were took you're moving for cover covering each other they change their tactics we have to change our tactics we need today's weapon right we need today's weapon because the weapons of world war ii will not help you on this day if we went to war with what my great-uncle was fighting in north africa with it wouldn't do any good we just get picked off like flies and the same thing the Pentecostal message will not help today right because they denominated they took a man's title right they made their creats they made the church and they died hallelujah we got to go beyond that meant that this message will never do nominate but this message is Jesus Christ right this Living Word it's not you can't put God in a box you can't just say well this is how it is God cannot be boxed history is proved it they tried to make the lutheran box he says I'll not be bound by this book hallelujah all the way down through histories being that way it's the same thing today God could not be boxed hallelujah we need today's work brother Bram says this entire message meets in time condition that means it's the weapon for today this word has been released you as the weapon for today that's why we're not ignorant to the devil's devices it's not a big bunch of conspiracy theory we see what he's doing in the political realm and the religious realm entertainment whatever realm others we see him we're not explained Lee walking along and what's happening we know what's happening amen you know the best you know the best thing to do if you're in a battle pick your battlefield if you can pick your battlefield you have the advantage right if you do not get to pick your battlefield you can be at disadvantage because the enemy can prepare the battlefield right and you can just walk into a death trap amen we have to and but the only way you can pick your battlefield to see where your enemy is if you do not see where he is then you just walk into his ambush amen and that's why brother Graham says with the opening of the seals Satan's just being stripped down he's being exposed here he was the first say to second h3 h4 h v 8 6 agent he's here today hallelujah I'm glad that's the case aren't you glad I'd be glad thank you Lord you've given me battlefield intelligence I know where my enemy is I know what he did in the beginning with the sermon saying yay hath God said and here's a kiss here's a being that doesn't have a relationship with God knows nothing of a young over of relationship as in father to children he says yay hath God said if Eve was really smart she would have said maybe she could have seen why don't know just cause my husband and then he would have said no God has said and it would have been the end of it right but the devil always tries to put the quick you mock where does that question lead you that's going to be the question where's this questioningly gonna lead you if you pay heed to it hallelujah now we need to put on the whole armor of God you got to have the life it's more than a cliche I have the Holy Ghost because many people say they have the Holy Ghost and their life proofs they do not right and that's the biggest that's the biggest robbery the devil can actually make you believe you're a Christian without a real birth amen this is Jesus told the parable the five why's the five foolish virgin they all thought they were going but when the midnight cry came behold the bridegroom cometh and they woke up and five said five were foolish what someone is forced they don't take things seriously they just want to skip along real happy and free well they think they are you know sure they're being foolish with their salvation I don't want to be foolish with my salvation right I want to know that my experience matches God's Bible right and in my life that's being lived out of me matches his Bible right that's what we want to be sure there's still the fruit of the Spirit are still real today right a manifest manifestation of God's life of the people that's still real today right we're not just here to happy stuff shirts and never you know all I have this religion whatever it's got to be a life it's got to live amen and those five foolish they didn't go into the marriage and it was too late for them to get the oil the oils the Holy Ghost but yet they were there with the wise they men make you calling election Shore amen we live in a day where we need to pre certain you know I I just got an email this morning where so the Jews know this is a side note but the Jews is a there's a sacrifice of a red heifer in the Old Testament and then you didn't take that red heifer it's got to be purely without blemish a red heifer and they and they if I set they take the ashes mixing with water and different things and they used that to purify the priesthood and then the priest can go on to service without that the priest could not go into service first and the Jews are looking for this red heifer and Rabbi Richman who's in charge of the temple Institute he says that they have it they have it just came out now the real red here for they need is Christ cause this washed by the water of the word right that's what they really need but they're looking for that because they say we need this and then we can you know and then we can purify the priesthood because they found out who the priest sir then they can rebuild the temple they these people are dedicated they are and they know nothing of of where goddess today all they have is history and the Old Testament but God's moved on but yet they're very devout people because God is moving cause these I hope will be 144,000 of them that will receive the same Jesus we know after we're in the rapture but they are very devout people I'm not taking you know I think we should give them some credit for that at this and if that's all they have they don't have a Living Christ they don't have a living Messiah all they have is history a God of yesterday not a God of today and then there any diligent what about us what about us Oh God live live in my life come and manifest in me Oh Lord anoint my life more than just a form you know Christianity is not just a you're a Reformation I work at this book that I work at this point I work at this point and now I'm doing this there's no what Christianity is Christianity's our death a burial and a resurrection where you literally die you ought to die right you don't just reform yourself that old nature must die you're gonna stay there until he changes you amen and then you come forth in units of life that's always the biggest struggle people aren't willing to die they want to keep their fig leaf religion and walking on but the first thing god that he took all the fig leaves off Adam and Eve said you're covering won't do you any good that every leaf had to go before those lambs kids could come on them right and it's the same thing but people want to bring their old religion into the new Paul said I counted all but dung that's what he valued his education his studies he was a devout man I'm a Pharisee the Pharisees he said but he said I can't at all but dung that I may win Christ what about you well I've done heaps for God you got a cattle but dang of it's from the denomination a men I want to have the whole armour of God now I was going to read a few things then when men when man fell everyone happy then when man fell he lost us and now what he lost in the fall Christ came as a redeemer did you ever stop us think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that adam and adam lost in the fall now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to this place man in the fall has lost his conscious of what father put him here on earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain their outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things it's all become so clogged up with that until god can't operate through those channels that god that he made a man for so people he lost consciousness of what father put him on earth to do you know and i think it it's good ones role to say lord what is my purpose of being why am I here why am i here upon the earth it's more than just to exist there's a reason you were here in this hour you're not here haphazardly God doesn't it's not like some big lottery but in like the numbers come out every suffered and he came you out and he said you to the earth he knew you'd be here right and there's a reason you're here and you here to manifest his word to this dying world you're here to manifest him right that he would take you and live through you amen sure we we have families that's good we have jobs that's good right we have church we have different things that's good but what are we here for all those things encompass it right if you you know if you're a mother God made you a mother if your father God made you a father right and those are godly offices you know but don't just get caught up don't miss the main thing why are your father that God would manifest himself through your family why your mother that God would manifest himself through you to your family right which men to be channels of his anointing hallelujah now he says now when God made the human body every little part of it had place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if God so I patterned the man the body of a man how much more has he patent and set in order the body of Christ the church if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of a son the church and he's designed us to come together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these supernatural workings of God outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom knowledge gifts of healing and all these other different gifts as outlets that God let's uh let's out his power and lets out his revelation to the people it's not so much an individual so it's not and not as an individual so much but as a unit we're all together one great body of believers now the thing is we are in a war there's a war between there's a conflict between God and Satan being lived out now war causes some soldiers to get amnesia shell-shocked whose - Oh Jacques where the under bombardment so much they just can't take it anymore they have a breakdown and then they forget who they are this this world we live in a in a battlefield and this world has been bombarding the devil's been firing artillery at us since we were born because God wants us to know who we are the devil does not want us to know who we are in God the devil does not want you to know who you are in Jesus Christ he does not want you to know your position he does not want you to know your authority over him he does not the devil does not want you to know these things amen the devil does not want you to know that Jesus Christ has redeemed you to the position that Adam fell from right Adam was God over the earth and Adam and Eve there one right the devil does not want you to know that you are above him then he is under your feet there you have dominion over him the devil does not want you to know these things right some of the greatest military defeats is because the the ones defeated received the wrong intelligence about their attacker and they actually received a lie and they capitulated they lost the battle because the enemy actually spread lies they receive the wrong intelligence and that's why they gave up well we can't win this battle but if they really thought they would have won and it's the same thing with you and I if God can just pour into our hearts what he's made us and not just for a Sunday morning but every moment of the day our position in him and the authority we really have right now not in the future you know the Bible says now we are the sons of God right now I mean right now we're in seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now right now we're cleanse from sin right now we are right now the devil's Luster's hold right now right now by a stripes were healed right now right now we are redeemed right now hallelujah right now The Devil's under our feet right now not in the future right now that's why God has to open our eyes that the victory that he yeah it's more than a story he died on the cross it's a reality but as the anchor has to go from here down to here that he carried you're sending it up Calvary that day and it's done right now hallelujah but the devil doesn't want you to know those things amen and that's why he tries to twist you all kind of way keep you in this flesh get you looking at the here and now in all the situation's away and you forget who you are now with that in mind you see when people get away from God and won't listen to the word have no more desire for the word then there's one diagnosis to it the soul that sinneth that soul shall die unbelief shall separate you from God that's exactly right but he knew what the disease what the results were when he seen the disease of sin in the city now this amnesia we're told it is a cause you to be to a place that you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the cases is from shock it's somebody that doesn't even know who they are they find it from war sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing it could think cause it is worry worry will cause it worry has no virtue at all no just skip worry and accept faith so amnesia says makes you forget your identity makes you forget and that's why people people are looking for an identity in this hour and it depends what age you are that's what y'all identify worth so for example when I was young and I worshipped cricket I wanted to be Danny Morrison he was my identity I don't can't remember if the black camps were called the Black Caps in those days but you know when they lost I was devastated because that was my identity if they were winning I was winning and they if they lost I lost hallelujah and then boo then when I get a bit older I saw something and I wanted to be like Russell Coutts with the America's Cup I wanted to be him that's because I used to sail as well since my identity right I wanted to be become like him because I was looking for an identity and then as you get older you're always looking looking looking and then I wanted to be like you know sports stars whatever more but then eventually Jesus came and he said no this is your identity you're not meant to be a gamer and a winner and a music fiend in whatever more you know making homebrew all this stuff no that's not you he came he says that's not you this is who you are I'll show you who you are and that's what the message make the Bible live mate Jesus Christ came out of history because I heard a prophet say you know he preached Redemption and completeness and enjoy and so why so many fails to keep the victory oh I found no God say no you need to die you need to give up all these things place you place yourself on my altar on my wheel I'll mold you and shape you you know I didn't look for how to reform I just said God take everything out of my life this country to your word that you can dwell in me that was my prayer and God began to deal and then now he can then he came and dwelt in me hallelujah I mean that's all you got to keep your focus on him don't look at all the other stuff that all disappear well I got this and this to worry about now look under Jesus Amen if you have real faith he'll take you to the new birth hallelujah so worried we just read there you say well I haven't been in battle and you know but worry can cause you to lose your identity don't worry as he says skip the worry and just accept faith amen someone said well now what if you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry I said no don't think so what I said worry couldn't do nothing but make me worse why worry what can worry do has worried helped anyone ever then why are we trying to worry our selves that's a good is that a good question you know what's the end result hasn't helped you well what's good is it gonna have faith I see it might deliver me that's right see so worried has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue belief now worry sometimes cause it with a spin around amnesia and another thing that calls it among the people is getting between two opinions this is really I want to want to get to you get between two opinions you begin to lose your identity well as the message right is the Bible accurate or is it not and then people are tossed to and fro and they forget who they are because they're looking at these little issues with God who's the God that called you what called you in the beginning as I see nothing last Sunday you know Jesus he the other he was you're the woman touched the hem of His garment virtue came out of and he says who touched me someone made contact and changed him right and changed her to because she got healed but then you gotta ask the question oh you got to flip it around and you say who touched you spiritually what got a hold of your life what was it my Peter James and John a man just walks past look like any other man come follow me telling him this is okay I'll follow you I follow him miracles happen he never spake like any other man he's standing here in John chapter 6 and they see eat my flesh drink my blood you have no life in you doesn't explain it there was a 70 there that he commissioned to go do miracles there's five thousand they all left and then now his Peter James and John then and the disciples and Jesus just tense him and and and he just says will you go also he just asked the question will you go please read it imagine that he wasn't saying please don't leave me he's not will you go I'm giving you a way out if you want to here's your way and the impedance says to whom shall we go thou have the words of eternal life maybe saying I don't know something got ahold of me is something within me they've got a hold of the range they couldn't explain it what do you what does he mean by that I don't know but I'm gripped this is amazing what Peter said I'm gripped his words have gripped me I don't know exactly where it's going to take me but I am sure that he is the Christ he is the Christ and he followed him and they ended up in heaven I think that's a good destination he couldn't fill in the between and the and don't whatever more you know just let go let God have his way what got ahold of you you got to ask the question what got ahold of me I guarantee you it wasn't a religion it wasn't a different way of life or just a nice idea it's God as Jesus Christ hallelujah so don't be between two opinions either God is right or he's wrong and in my opinion he's right this one is true hallelujah I mean I think we should be contending for the faith for something not against full hallelujah this is in the book of Jude contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we should get in for it I mean so we should contend for God dwelling in people we should contend in you know the devil being defeated we should continue for divine healing we should contend for Peace Love joy long-suffering patience price meekness temperance we should be contending for those things shouldn't we we should be contending for the reality I just praying before I said Lord the skies full of the genuine brother I said why take a substitute when the skies full of the genuine Pentecostal blessings the reality of God I said God I don't want a substitute if the sky is full of the real let's have the real I mean what why put up with a substitute adjust some words I want a reality absolutely if God is he's not a historical God I'm sure it's anchored in your soul by now he's the same yesterday today and forever he does not change totally doesn't matter what happens in the world God is the same and if he's the same he will transform us children like he did at the beginning he'll do the same thing now so the woman of the world she had no man problem after that hallelujah shouldn't go back to that man she was living with she went and went to a new life Legion didn't go back to any tombs hallelujah I mean they you know there's a funeral procession for a big boy Jesus came along he interrupts every funeral procession he came back to life that boy didn't go back and die Justine he lived right should be the same thing with you something's happened to me NOLA lujah I believe it I've experienced it I don't want to go back to any just you know I remember sitting in an Anglican Church big old organ you know kneel say this Dan say this say this appreciate this you say this I don't want anything like that I don't just want something formal thing amen God doesn't want us to have some formal religion he wants a reality amen it'll cause amnesia being between two opinions and it gets you to a place where actually what what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't make you don't know who you are so I said the devil doesn't want you to know who you are he will cause you to worry he'll cause you to be between two opinions right see you're bouncing around these or things you forget who you are in the love you can't identify yourself you can walk around eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education you can't same education your head but you don't know where it come from you don't know who you are where you belong that's amnesia so we're told God does want us to be in this condition he doesn't want us to be stumbling around Who am I that's a big question people Who am I where do i I that's why there's a gender fluidity and all these things as people looking for where do they belong you let God reveal himself to you one time you'll know where you belong now we'll go here see Satan wasn't that bunch of Jewish teachers and rabbis and priests trying to tell them to keep the law of Moses when the very word said that in that day the Son of Man would be revealed see that he would reveal himself so they was trying as long as they kept them religious and on the law of Moses so what he did he was trying to tell them that part of the word is just exactly right but this man isn't that person trying to tell about the Messiah yes it's true he will come he will do these things versus not him we're looking for another right and that's what the devil does he tries to always the word it's always the contention that's why Peter says to be established in the present truth who's read that and one of his epistles he'll be established in the present truth that's what you need to be because it's where the present is that's where the devil's fighting and as regattas I mean he will let you know all that Moses did the devil he'll let you know all that what Moses was fine was perfectly well what John the Baptist did was probably fine what Jesus did was perfectly fine what the Apostles will do fine but when it comes to the promise of this day that's where he says no it's not true that doesn't apply here this is for someone else and if he could just keep you with that mindset then you'll never actually be in contact with the Living God because he's the I am right amen now see how see how deceiving that is that's the real day of deception it's been and now is Satan establishing his kingdom in the earth that's exactly why he's doing it for he wants to establish his own Kingdom as businessman there's not a Christian he will work every scheme he can make and he can to make you see something the wrong way if he's got a purpose and a personal gain and making you do that making you see it that way he will show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it because he's got a feeling only for himself no matter how much he lies and cheats and whatever more he's got personal gain and that's why Satan's done this and he's worked through the ministry to do it as God promised he would do amen now he said he would exalt himself above the most high see that in in the beginning he would have sinned above the clouds and the stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats as isaiah 14 he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by people letting him explain by letting people explain away in every age the value of god's promised word to that age that's all he has to do diminish the value of the word for your day right what happened when Jesus was here they tried to diminish the value of him we know you are a devil you're a Samaritan you know you're not the Promised One you're not the Messiah well diminishing the value of the word for their day right by letting the people explain it so it took explaining away they explained Jesus ministry away do you know they did he was dead buried resurrected whole whole troop of Roman soldiers around that tomb the angel comes down they fall down as dead men run away terrified the stones are all the way then they come to the high priest this is what happened this is our testimony you thought about that he comes to Centurion Oh high priest sir oh I know what he said you know we were there we were guarding it but in the third day an angel came down I don't think I don't think I said sure we were smoking about an angel and in the debrief you know you think about it and then what did they what are the Highbridge to just take this money just just tell everyone that the disciples stole his body and that's commonly told they explained it away I mean if they did it that day they will explain Jesus away today right they just explain him away well this and this and whatever hold on it doesn't change the fact that happened right Jesus is but a footnote in history do you know that he has but a footnote in history yet and people explain they say about the virgin birth or some soldier impregnated Mary really they're just explaining it away and it's there in history it didn't happen that way the angel Gabriel came to her hallelujah they'll be found with child by the Holy Ghost amen that's exactly how he's done at every age he's explained it away in the days of Noah he explained that it was impossible for it to rain from heaven it had never rained it had never rained in the days of Noah and he comes a man it's gonna rain the water's going to cover the world you're all gonna die unless you get in the boat I build oh that's very convenient we're gonna listen to you what's this thing you're peddling that you're the only one who has the message for the day he did we accept it because it's just history but what if Noah was standing here today God's gonna destroy this world because the wickedness of the people God's going to flood this world you're to get in this boat I'm building otherwise you get a drowned it's gonna rain and we'd say mr. Noah sir it's never rain before what's rain go read the scripture never rained can you explain to me how it's gonna rain and maybe he would have said God had told me well what do you mean God told you your voice is speaking to you gone crazy that other person said God told them things and he wouldn't shut some people how does it you know you can't just say God told God but God told him he built the ark people made fun of you're crazy this crazy but religion it's not an it's not in line with the current trend they were they were religious and they day they win a bunch of atheists they had their temples and their priests and their religions and their denomination whatever more and he's a man building it out with his three sons you know and people say no that can't be right because it's so small and whatever more no God put it there in front of everyone for a hundred and twenty years however long it took him to build it it was there and he was preaching it was the same and finally was built then the animals walk in we can do that it's been done before they explained it away why didn't other people get in and then the door closes and then it rains and it's too late because the devil explained it away how about man does not change it's not logical that it'll rain because scientifically it's never rained put out your rainmeter they do it baby you know look it's empty have we ever had rain records no think about it and you're telling me it's gonna rain where it's never rained before and that he had no proof the only proof he had as God told me amen and here we are in this day and people think we're crazy but God spoke his word is true this is not a history book it's become alive in this day right God's promised he fulfills his word by bringing it to pass we see his word being fulfilled he said this Malachi 4:2 turn our hearts back to the original faith Amen the greatest proof that this that Christianity this message is real is because of people being transformed and God dwells in them that is the vindication I want proof I'm the proof I used to be a rag sinner that was lost and undone and God transformed me I didn't go to a church people no one told me God told me the believers of indication right the believers of indication amen you want to see proof of the resurrection here's proof of the resurrection people have been raised from death to life that's the proof that Jesus came out of the tomb hallelujah amen now great scientific gospel that he preached in the Garden of Eden this is this is the sea serpent he could shoot the instruments to the moon and prove there's no moisture up there but God said they would come a rain but Satan succeeded and poison the mind of the people by scientific research that it could only not be done but it was done God said it would be done and it was done he did amen now the thing is you say well how do you and then another thing he can do the devil can do maybe just go back to this the the devil tries to wear us down I'm just going to go back two hours talking about the battlefield we have to we picked the battlefield now I know there's the battle on the mind right but how that battle plays out is actually up to us where you going the things you look at and the things you read will dictates what happens in here that's I know it's very simple but you know if you're if you're reading a bunch of atheistic stuff on the internet that will affect you it will it will sway you right it will and so now you're actually doing the enemy put some weapons in the battlefield against you right but now you can dictate because we are we're not robots any robots in here we're not message robots we're people and you have free moral choice but you're free roll choice should be but should be governed by your nature right if your nature is of the Lord then your choices will be towards him right but if you have an unconverted you'll go to the world because you're in line with the world but now I'm just reading here with Sampson because Sampson was worn down by Delilah there's just the last part of it and she said unto Him how canst thou say I love thee when thy heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has not told me were in thy great strength lieth and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death then he told her all his heart and said unto her there have not come a razor upon my head for I have razor upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven there my strength will go from me I'll become weak and be like any other man he so Sampson went to Delilah right he actually decided I'm going there so he opened himself up he opened himself up to the enemy's attack right he actually he yo Delilah then covered Israel he went into the fullest island and he opened himself up and then there's what happens this is the devil's slowly slowly works away slowly works away little by little if you let him he'll work at you he's got time right he'll slowly work at you and that's why you've got to say well why would you even expose you now you know I'm talking very genuinely about what you what do you think about it he ended up with a strength God right he gave he exposed all of his heart to his enemy who was actually paid to kill him or find the find the source and the thing that made him separate to God that gave him the strength he surrendered it because of the workings of the enemy now I'm talking very gingerly because it covers a lot of things in life but you got to be careful where the devil will work at you he'll work at you and he'll find the source of your strength and take it from you the source of our strength is not hid knowledge the source of our strength God and you Christ in you the hope of glory right but he will get you into a environment where that is basically cept out of you if he can we don't want to get that's why you can pick your battlefield we can't dictate what the world does but we can dictate how it affects us amen hey we don't live in China where where there's a big part of China well small part of China where it's predominately a Muslim population and recently every home in that province has a communist party member go live with them let's just happen because now they're going to be taught that the the ways of communism to try and get them because it's been what you don't know about the uprising you know that unrest in one region of China because it's predominantly Muslim so now the Chinese saying this is how we'll fix it will we'll see him party members to live with the people and they're gonna preach coming isn't to the people now we don't live that kind of yo but the world is quite invasive right the world is quite a razor they can't dictate yes we'll have them in our home or not they just there they'll live with them they have to accept them into their home but yet if we open the door right if we open the door then the enemy can't get a hold of us right what are we and it's the promise we live in a world of grey don't we the devil works in the gray so he works it's not just oh this is this is God and this is Satan no he's a big gray area and the Devils influenced every part of society right and we need rural Holy Ghost discernment is that God or is that Satan right we need to think about that will give me a give me an illustration minor book store or Christian Christian literature Christian music Christian movies where's the inspiration come from what life is the people projecting right he takes on the most famous artists today what life are they living what do they dress this what do they live that is their preaching a message and they are the embodiment of that message right they are the interpretation of what they believe your life is the interpretation of what you believe right so if you really believe the word your life will be interpretation of that word so you don't think about well ah but it's so wonderful of course it's so wonderful Satan is an entertainment they haven't so fine tuned the lights are at the right level the sounds of the right level the dancers are at the whatever more it's so choreographed the big lightshow of course it course it entices people I mean of course it does it's designed that way to keep people but then we don't want to let that influence us what's it doing to our thinking what's it doing to our walk you say but I feel so good don't let your emotions rub you because they get an emotional high you see people there they're crying they're screaming they're genuinely rejoicing but what do they worship ik amen now he sees this here and then we'll wind up what's the time early on Wednesday night we see some television program they all take off to the basement watch some television program and minister was telling me the other day he went to eat supper with a person and while they were getting supper really dismissed his wife had to go watch we love Suzy or something like that before she could even cook supper for them brother I'm telling you when it comes it shows that the home life no matter I no wonder we were juvenile deliquency know one of the secrets been discovered it's taken the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the people and they are they are going for the things of the world and center for coming back to God stop look and listen the coming of the Lord is at hand what good is our knowledge do what good will our big buildings do what of our intellect will do amen it'll see what good will those things to see what you love is what you'll do right yeah yeah you see like people have traveled around the world to go to the World Cup and Russia they love soccer they save up they sacrifice and they go and they're looking forward to it because the spirit of the game is in them you don't have to drag them to the World Cup they don't have to be arrested and put on a plane and you - out watch this world cup no they and and they didn't you know and they gladly pay crazy amount of money for all the merchandise and everything paint themselves will crazy colours and dance around and whatever more you don't have to make them do it because the spirit of the game is in them right and it's the same thing with a believer if the Spirit of Christ is in you you love the Lord you worship Him you live for him you don't have to it's not a drudgery to come to church it's not a drudgery to read the word it's not a drudgery to pray it's a joy it's a wonderful thing because the sport of God is in you oh yeah so if you really see what spirit is in you by the life you live I mean and so we shouldn't be caught up you gotta watch what you're caught up with because you see what the Spirit in you is feeding on now resist the devil how do you resist the devil the same way our chief captain told us to do take the Word of God that's how you resist the devil by the Word of God the chief captain told us how it was done all right now I'm closing I want to say this that old devil now you think he is brazen you think he'll attack a child he will attack anything he attacked Jesus Christ he came at him with three world attacks did you know that Satan didn't just come with just one at sorry just only attack once he will attack you with a disease then here he'll come back a tech and say the days of miracles is past you can't get healed and nothing to do it you know that's right he's attacked Jesus three times three well the tax he run in on Jesus with unbelief in God's Word it is written Jesus says is written he's showing how to resist it is written right and he overcame him as attackers what disbelieve God's Word that's his attack there you can see the greatest battles ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what Satan's weapon against you is to try and get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's disarmed you right so if he thinks your weapon is equivalent Satan doesn't have a weapon have you ever actually looked in his armory all he has is deception and lies he's a slicker I mean he's a deceiver of man he doesn't have a weapon that's why in the first stage he rode forth with a bow and no arrows Here I am with my bow and he conquered by by deceit so if the devil can get you to believe that he is actually armed he's got you a man you got to call his hand call your bluff how many times you hit brother bury the prayer line Satan you're nothing but a bluff amen so now our brother never law hope you never disbelieve that look he just arms you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finish your fight you're done hold that weapon don't lay it down amen that's why the devil comes long is this really true did it really happen is it really accurate I believe it is that's me I believe it works and it works I've seen it work right Allu you now for he the worse for what spurred serve for the reading bases Hebrews the worst for once purse has no more conscious of sin sin is passed from him I heard brother Neville saying this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why'd I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action the Holy Ghost is the action and you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence it but it is a person Jesus Christ the Word of God established in your heart to quicken every word of this age right right that's what the Holy Ghost is God and you to quicken the word I mean more than just the manifestation as I said people could be anointed but they be false anointed ones right Balaam Balaam was anointed as the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied and it's still coming to pass his prophecy but he was a false vessel right he was a false anointed one and so it's going to be more than just an anointing as I say what is the life that's lived out of you after the experience amen because of us just now I believe in being anointed I've spoken in tongues I've shouted I've been under the anointing walking around I felt like I was drunk I was no I did but but there's none of the prefer perverse side of being drunk I was drunk in the spirit all things like that but what life happens after what life is produced by their fruits what they do you shall know them amen so you got a look at that don't be deceived as he in you is he living now we know our Lord predicted such a time now this is um we'll just finish with this such a time to come there'd be unrest among nations perplexed of times distress between the nations and we have tried everything that's seemingly humanly possible to make it last just a little longer but I believe that we're just running out I don't believe that there's anything else that we could do about it if we just we just at the end of it we tried we tried for a while on having kings in there and that wouldn't work then they tried democracy it doesn't work and we've tried they've tried dictators it doesn't work and each one seemed just a little bit shallower each time and now we stand at the greatest moment when anything could happen it could be over in five minutes the greatest bone anything could happen sorry it could be over in five minutes time the every nation can be laid to powder and if we're just at that time we're ought the church to be a great crisis then also we have a home life crisis it seems the home life is running out into shallow water it used to be a home that the father the head of the house would sit down of a morning and he would speak with his family and they would each take out the old family Bible read and and read just a bit of it and that all gather around the table and have prayer you don't see that no more and when the day was done and my head the dishes washed that all gatherin and read some more of the Bible and pray before going to bed he says this is how home life used to be amen now what about today we have only 24 hours in the day right some of that time is asleep so we don't have 24 hours consciously awake now but there's a lot more distractions today you have to look it now you have to look what is you know I'm just gonna finish with us or what is the equation what is your goal in life what are you wanting to achieve what do you want if you just want a nice family you can have a nice family right but your ultimate goal should be God living right God living not just in church every moment of the day where he can take you and he could annoy you and speak to someone or a burden for prayer can come on your heart and you can pray through for that and you can find out later that that person was healed or someone was delivered or something like that right or the family comes and the devil tries to attach himself doesn't he someone comes in all upset you know something's going on and it's just the enemy trying to have a go and you can pray create an atmosphere and that thing is cast out I mean this this is what we have is it not does it not but what does our home life centered around you say yes I want God to live then you gotta say well Lord your well why do I need to be birthed into the kingdom right and the Holy Ghost feeds on the word amen and what do we there has to be it I just finished with this the token made the difference in our opening text right there has to be a token for the house as well for your house the Holy Ghost must be a token for your house that it becomes a place of sanctuary right without it the death angel will come in right but with it he'll stay away and that's the problem people can profess all kinds of things but without that life on display it doesn't do any good I mean so how about you is that Tok is God actually alive or is it just you know you're up and down in and out don't know what's true what's wrong who I am who God is you know are you going by someone else's experience or do you have your own well he became personal to you amen let's have the musicians please
