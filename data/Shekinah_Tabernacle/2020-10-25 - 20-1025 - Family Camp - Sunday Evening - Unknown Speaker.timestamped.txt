[40:03] through this without crying
[40:07] okay look if i didn't have tears to
[40:09] express either joy or happiness

[40:21] that oh
[40:22] and so the treasure hunts they went all
[40:23] around and then they found these huge
[40:25] boxes
[40:26] full of balloons and presents and what i
[40:27] wanted them to see in the balloons was
[40:29] that they're worth ten thousand or more
[40:33] more than ten thousand worlds so that's
[40:36] how much they mean to the lord
[40:41] um

[41:26] home
[41:27] and stays there
[41:30] okay um okay
[41:34] we can do this um adamand go ahead
[41:38] so it started before the world began you
[41:41] and i were with our heavenly father we
[41:43] were praising and
[41:44] shouting for joy we were fellowshipping
[41:47] with god almighty
[41:49] then our father had an idea he wanted to
[41:51] do something
[41:53] very special for us he wanted to make us
[41:56] a world
[41:58] a place to enjoy all his amazing
[42:01] and marvelous creations and they're
[42:04] amazing creations they're mountains and
[42:06] trees and animals
[42:07] and he made the whole earth for you
[42:11] for you for you for you for you
[42:14] for you who he wanted to give us
[42:17] presents all around us so that we would
[42:19] know how much he loves us and adores
[42:23] us and because of these amazing presents
[42:27] we of course love him and adore him back
[42:30] then sin and satan
[42:34] took us away kidnapped us
[42:39] separated us
[42:45] and he cries for us and children and we
[42:48] cry for him
[42:52] what could he do he had to pay
[42:56] the kidnapper a ransom and on earth for
[42:59] a ransom
[43:00] we they give money they want money the
[43:02] thieves want money
[43:03] but he couldn't give money we were more
[43:06] than money to him
[43:08] we were more than gold and silver more
[43:10] than oceans and kingdoms and stars and
[43:13] planets and earths
[43:14] well earth we were more than everything
[43:17] the flash's car the biggest boat
[43:20] what could he possibly give more than
[43:23] all these things
[43:24] what is the greatest thing that you
[43:27] could think of
[43:29] what is possibly greater than all these
[43:32] gifts he made us
[43:34] the creator himself
[43:46] he is more than anything and everything
[43:49] and to him we mean more than anything
[43:52] and everything we mean more to him more
[43:56] than even his
[43:57] own life and you know what else
[44:00] he did he knew there would be sickness
[44:02] and pain
[44:03] when sin came and while we are here on
[44:06] earth he wants us to be well
[44:08] and happy and for that
[44:12] he took whip
[44:15] after whip after whip
[44:20] so that we could be healed he allowed
[44:23] himself to be
[44:24] hurt and hurt and hurt
[44:27] so that we don't have to be he
[44:30] paid the ransom
[44:34] just drop it he gave his all
[44:38] he gave everything for us so that we
[44:41] could be
[44:42] together again
[44:54] [Music]
[44:58] now we are his and he is ours again
[45:02] there is nothing that can separate
[45:04] separate us
[45:05] we will never be kidnapped again
[45:09] we are his and he is ours
[45:12] and guess what right now
[45:16] and he is making and preparing a new
[45:18] earth
[45:19] and a new heaven for who for
[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:30] us
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:58] see
[46:01] [Music]
[46:10] amen jesus paid it all amen
[46:14] we've got one more item before we um and
[46:16] we'll just sing one or two songs after
[46:17] that
[46:18] i feel a nice atmosphere here tonight
[46:21] and
[46:22] so the um if the chicano choir could
[46:23] come up just and well there
[46:25] where they're coming up you know i just
[46:27] share a bit of a testimony about the
[46:29] song as they come up to prepare
[46:32] to share a bit of a testimony about this
[46:34] song
[46:40] because you know in light of what we've
[46:43] seen like as what the lord has done for
[46:44] us
[46:47] what it says in return is present your
[46:48] body's a living sacrifice
[46:51] you know like it's not just he does that
[46:52] but actually we recognize what he's done
[46:54] and we
[46:55] if he loves us enough to do that for us
[46:57] then we need to trust him
[47:00] we can trust him in his dealings and and
[47:03] his ways are far above our ways and
[47:05] that's what
[47:05] the song is about is a lot of times in
[47:09] your life you don't understand
[47:10] what's happening to you you don't know
[47:12] why things are like how they are
[47:14] you know if i could share testimony
[47:15] about this week four or five years ago
[47:18] in the camp
[47:18] i think the first camp we had here i was
[47:20] standing in this position here
[47:22] in this spot here i think playing bass
[47:23] guitar in
[47:25] life as i knew it wasn't going very well
[47:27] at all you know it was bad
[47:29] but god told me when i was standing here
[47:31] that i'm going to give you peace
[47:33] and because i've been fighting fighting
[47:35] a battle for years and years and years
[47:36] and it just
[47:38] wasn't looking good and you know you get
[47:40] that and you go home you think well it's
[47:41] just i'm going to get peace straight
[47:42] away
[47:43] it got worse and worse to the worse that
[47:45] it's ever been
[47:47] but you can trust god if god said he's
[47:49] going to give me peace and he's going to
[47:50] give me peace
[47:51] it doesn't matter if it looks like
[47:52] there's not peace there's going to be
[47:53] peace
[47:55] you know and and i can declare today
[47:57] that i have
[47:59] pretty much almost got peace you know
[48:01] from all those enemies are gone
[48:03] and and but it's
[48:06] can you put the words up to the song you
[48:08] go through i just want to encourage you
[48:10] because a lot of the times in your life
[48:12] you won't understand what's going on
[48:14] but you've got to apply faith to your
[48:15] situation god knows exactly what's going
[48:18] on
[48:18] you you're not where you are by a
[48:20] mistake or an accident
[48:22] or god doesn't know that you're there
[48:27] nothing in your life is an accident have
[48:29] more faith in god than that don't let
[48:30] satan tell you oh
[48:31] maybe this may be that no god knows
[48:33] exactly where you are and he's got a
[48:34] plan
[48:35] even if it all looks bleak and that's
[48:36] what the song not that one it's the
[48:38] other one
[48:41] it's the words are if you lead through
[48:45] the valley i'll go and in faith i
[48:46] believe that you know what is best for
[48:48] the plan that you have in your great
[48:49] mind
[48:51] if you lead where the eagles saw where
[48:52] my joy and my peace overflow then i know
[48:54] that you must think i need refreshing if
[48:56] you pour out the oil in the wine
[48:58] or if you lead through a blazing fire if
[49:00] i have to wait until the morning comes
[49:02] i'll wait
[49:02] you can have it your way jesus your way
[49:05] you can have it your way jesus and
[49:08] that's what a surrendered life is to
[49:09] christ you surrender all to christ you
[49:10] so you can have your way in every
[49:12] situation where the good or bad you
[49:13] praise the lord
[49:14] and that that's true victory for a
[49:17] [Music]
[49:28] believer
[49:34] [Music]
[49:37] if you lead through the valley our goal
[49:42] and in faith i'll believe that you know
[49:47] what is best for the plan that you
[49:50] have in your great
[49:54] [Music]
[49:57] but mind you lead where the eagle soar
[50:03] when my joy and my peace overflow
[50:08] then i know that you must think i need
[50:15] refreshing if you pour out the
[50:18] oil and water or if
[50:22] you lead through the blazing fire
[50:26] if i have to wait until the morning
[50:31] comes
[50:32] away
[50:35] you can have it your way jesus your way
[50:43] you can have it your way jesus
[50:48] your way
[50:53] if you lead to the battle i'll stand
[50:59] for i know that you say by your right
[51:02] hand
[51:04] and you teach us my fingers
[51:19] [Music]
[51:20] where there's tear drops and heartaches
[51:24] and trials

[51:33] fire if you pour out the oil and the
[51:37] wine

[52:28] me you can have it your way
[52:34] and when the blessing's full
[52:37] like a fountain

[1:04:35] i don't know i always just feel so

[1:04:54] precious and wonderful name of our lord
[1:04:56] jesus christ

[1:05:04] that needed to
[1:05:07] come in and be part of this
[1:05:11] tremendous meetings it's really been
[1:05:14] so special to me
[1:05:18] and i just want to say god bless you
[1:05:22] do believe that the majority of us
[1:05:26] that's here god has done something
[1:05:30] for you
[1:05:34] um i want to thank the shekinah
[1:05:35] tabernacle
[1:05:37] you know i wish i could call your names
[1:05:40] but
[1:05:41] i don't want to single anyone out
[1:05:44] each and every one but ben you've got a
[1:05:46] great
[1:05:47] team you do i'm telling you it's just
[1:05:55] just
[1:05:59] just to see how everyone works together
[1:06:02] and just the way things are flowing just
[1:06:04] god richly bless you and i just i felt
[1:06:07] actually i wanted to single someone out

[1:06:16] is right now
[1:06:18] and that's just the christine cloyd
[1:06:23] i know she's hiding
[1:06:26] hiding somewhere
[1:06:30] it's just that christine listens to this
[1:06:31] i certainly say sister christine
[1:06:34] my wife and myself we appreciate you
[1:06:38] just always sort of in the background
[1:06:41] but standing and supporting your husband
[1:06:45] being the wife
[1:06:46] of a minister or even the wife of a
[1:06:50] pastor
[1:06:52] it's not easy
[1:06:55] there's a lot of pressures and stuff
[1:06:57] that goes with it but
[1:06:59] sister christine god bless you when you
[1:07:01] do listen to this
[1:07:03] know that we love you
[1:07:06] amen so if we could just stand to our
[1:07:08] feet
[1:07:10] this evening now
[1:07:13] when brother ben contacted me
[1:07:17] the lord laid two
[1:07:20] specific thoughts or
[1:07:23] burdens in my heart
[1:07:27] and the one burden the lord allowed me
[1:07:28] to release last night
[1:07:31] and i didn't know what was going to
[1:07:34] happen over this
[1:07:37] weekend but i knew that god
[1:07:40] was going to do something special
[1:07:44] so um if we could if we have our bibles
[1:07:46] if we could turn to
[1:07:47] exodus chapter three
[1:07:51] now freddie read the same scripture this
[1:07:54] morning
[1:07:57] freddie and i didn't compare notes
[1:08:03] he had no idea that i was going to read
[1:08:05] the scripture
[1:08:07] i had no idea that he was gonna read the
[1:08:10] scripture this morning
[1:08:11] so i panicked a bit when he read it
[1:08:16] so it's exodus
[1:08:19] chapter three and
[1:08:24] i'll just read just a few a few verses
[1:08:26] there
[1:08:27] um just and pray for me i'm just
[1:08:32] just very nervous exodus chapter 3
[1:08:36] verse 1 it says now moses kept
[1:08:39] the flock of jethro his father-in-law
[1:08:41] the priest of midian
[1:08:43] and he led the flock to the backside of
[1:08:45] the desert
[1:08:46] and came to the mountain of god even to
[1:08:49] horeb
[1:08:51] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:08:53] him in a flame of fire
[1:08:55] out of the midst of a bush and he looked
[1:08:59] and behold the bush burned with fire and
[1:09:02] the bush was not consumed
[1:09:04] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:09:08] see this great sight why the bush is not
[1:09:11] built
[1:09:12] and when the lord saw that he turned
[1:09:15] aside to see
[1:09:17] god called unto him out of the midst of
[1:09:21] the bush
[1:09:23] and said moses moses
[1:09:27] and he said yeah am i
[1:09:31] and then i've got another scripture we
[1:09:32] could turn to it in acts
[1:09:36] chapter 9
[1:09:39] and then we can just say word of prayer
[1:09:42] and then we can take our seats
[1:09:44] acts chapter 9.
[1:09:51] acts chapter 9
[1:09:56] and it reads verse 1 and saw
[1:09:59] yet breathing out threatenings and
[1:10:02] slaughter against the disciples of the
[1:10:04] lord
[1:10:05] went unto the high priest and desired of
[1:10:08] him letters to damascus
[1:10:10] to the synagogues that if he found any
[1:10:13] of this way
[1:10:14] whether they were they were men or women
[1:10:18] he might bring them bound into jerusalem
[1:10:21] and as he journeyed he came near
[1:10:23] damascus
[1:10:24] and suddenly they shined around him
[1:10:28] around about him a light from heaven
[1:10:32] and he fell to the earth and heard a
[1:10:35] voice
[1:10:36] saying unto him saul saul
[1:10:40] why persecutest thou me
[1:10:43] and he said who art our lord and the
[1:10:46] lord said
[1:10:47] i am jesus whom thou persecute us
[1:10:51] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:10:54] pricks
[1:10:55] and he trembling and astonished said
[1:10:58] lord
[1:11:00] what will thou have me to do
[1:11:03] and the lord said unto him arise
[1:11:06] and go into the city
[1:11:10] and it shall be told thee what thou must
[1:11:13] do
[1:11:15] lord your word has been read
[1:11:19] and father we just now hand everything
[1:11:22] over into your hands
[1:11:24] you speak and we will listen
[1:11:28] and we will obey in jesus name
[1:11:31] amen you may be seated tonight in the
[1:11:35] presence of almighty god
[1:11:43] so i was saying that when brother ben
[1:11:46] contacted me
[1:11:49] the lord gave me two direct
[1:11:52] and distinct burdens
[1:11:55] thoughts or titles whatever you may call
[1:11:58] it
[1:11:59] and obviously last night the lord
[1:12:01] allowed me to release
[1:12:03] the burden of last night and
[1:12:09] the the the the thought that the lord
[1:12:11] laid on my heart for tonight in the i'm
[1:12:13] gonna give a title
[1:12:15] and uh for me titles are not just titles
[1:12:19] but um it's something that is real
[1:12:22] something that is tangible
[1:12:23] and and something that i believe you and
[1:12:26] me we can identify with
[1:12:29] and my title for tonight
[1:12:33] is this
[1:12:36] i was one way
[1:12:40] now i am completely
[1:12:44] different
[1:12:48] something supernatural
[1:12:52] happened to me
[1:12:58] that's my title tonight
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] i was one way
[1:13:06] whatever that way was
[1:13:09] now i'm completely different because
[1:13:12] something
[1:13:13] supernatural happened to me
[1:13:20] and you know what that's my testimony
[1:13:22] like i said
[1:13:24] this is not just words
[1:13:28] so as brother tears saying that
[1:13:31] he speak of an experience
[1:13:37] and the inspiration behind it
[1:13:41] i asked my wife to sing that song
[1:13:43] tonight
[1:13:45] satan you cannot
[1:13:48] cross the bloodline
[1:13:54] you've lost the battle for souls
[1:14:01] my inspiration is that the devil
[1:14:05] is a liar
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:08] now when you go home and when we leave
[1:14:11] this place
[1:14:14] i want you to walk wherever you're
[1:14:17] walking whether it's wellington whether
[1:14:18] it's auckland where it's
[1:14:19] north island south island i want you to
[1:14:22] walk
[1:14:23] with an attitude of the devil
[1:14:26] is a liar
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:33] i want you to hold on to that receive it
[1:14:40] then as i was sitting at the back and
[1:14:43] the skit was going on and that
[1:14:46] background music was playing
[1:14:49] something inside of me just wanted to
[1:14:51] scream out
[1:14:54] freedom
[1:14:57] because that is what has happened
[1:15:01] and is happening this weekend
[1:15:10] was one way now i am
[1:15:13] completely different
[1:15:17] something supernatural happened
[1:15:20] and i know as i look at the faces of the
[1:15:23] believers tonight
[1:15:26] you can identify with it
[1:15:30] you can identify that something
[1:15:33] you can't maybe you can't explain it
[1:15:37] i was talking to brother andy's friend
[1:15:39] matt that matt
[1:15:40] i was talking to brother and his friend
[1:15:42] today
[1:15:43] and he was telling me that last night
[1:15:47] he says he can't explain it but
[1:15:50] something special happens
[1:15:55] and i believe it's nothing else but a
[1:15:58] supernatural
[1:15:59] god that came down
[1:16:02] to your seat
[1:16:08] now before i go on the lord impressed on
[1:16:11] me just to
[1:16:13] because obviously a lot of believers i'm
[1:16:16] a new face
[1:16:17] and not not much people know know me
[1:16:21] the lord just impressed before i
[1:16:22] continue just to to drop
[1:16:24] a little bit of my own personal
[1:16:26] testimony
[1:16:29] said you know where i come from and why
[1:16:32] i am the way i am
[1:16:36] you know ever since i can remember
[1:16:43] i i remember
[1:16:46] when i came to my senses whatever age
[1:16:48] that was
[1:16:50] all i knew was god's in the prophets
[1:16:56] i walked i lived
[1:17:00] and i breathed god sent a prophet
[1:17:04] i i i was i was brought up
[1:17:08] under i'll use the word
[1:17:12] um the canopy of the message
[1:17:17] i i i lived in
[1:17:20] a message home
[1:17:24] and i went to a message church
[1:17:28] in fact pastor harold beckett
[1:17:32] dedicated me as a little child
[1:17:36] so i i grew up under
[1:17:40] the canopy of the message
[1:17:44] as things in south africa took turns
[1:17:49] i found myself moving with my families
[1:17:54] and we ended up sitting at home
[1:17:59] and listening to tapes
[1:18:04] i've got three four siblings
[1:18:08] and i remember
[1:18:11] every sunday morning
[1:18:14] without fail my dad
[1:18:18] would take out a cassette tape of
[1:18:21] brother branham
[1:18:24] and i think my parents they might be
[1:18:27] watching on the live stream
[1:18:29] today so i want to greet my mom and my
[1:18:30] dad and i thank the lord for godly
[1:18:33] parents
[1:18:35] appreciate young people even parents
[1:18:39] appreciate your parents
[1:18:44] so i remember as little children
[1:18:47] we would um go into our lounge
[1:18:52] and dad would get in those days it was
[1:18:54] cassette tapes
[1:18:56] and dad would put that cassette tape in
[1:18:59] the tape here
[1:19:01] and we as children would sit
[1:19:04] on the couch and dad would press
[1:19:08] play and we have to sit
[1:19:13] and there were times when you'd sit and
[1:19:15] you think to yourself
[1:19:17] how long is this
[1:19:22] and then after a while because sometimes
[1:19:24] on that we you know it was like upright
[1:19:26] thing so you could see a little bit
[1:19:28] so you would watch so so this part of
[1:19:30] the reel
[1:19:31] would be before right so this is the
[1:19:34] start
[1:19:35] so i did before and then this so you'd
[1:19:38] watch
[1:19:39] when is this part of the reel gonna fill
[1:19:42] up
[1:19:42] because that will tell you where the
[1:19:45] tape's gonna finish
[1:19:48] i don't know
[1:19:52] so that was my life
[1:19:56] i every sunday listening
[1:20:01] to the trips of brother branham
[1:20:05] and then i was talking to brother
[1:20:07] matthew and i was saying
[1:20:08] i've got i've got family that's that's
[1:20:10] very studious
[1:20:12] in the word my uncles
[1:20:16] they my brother adrian and nathan
[1:20:19] they are able to go so deep
[1:20:22] into the world and i remember i would
[1:20:26] i would sit with these brothers
[1:20:29] in fact i'd find myself sitting in the
[1:20:32] corner
[1:20:34] and then the brothers would get together
[1:20:36] and they'll come with stacks of spoken
[1:20:38] words
[1:20:40] and then they would come sit down and
[1:20:43] then they would fellowship
[1:20:45] and this would be like all nighters at
[1:20:47] times and they'd fellowship about this
[1:20:49] and that and they'll take the quotes and
[1:20:52] they'll
[1:20:53] ended up obviously arguing with each
[1:20:55] other sometimes they even ended up
[1:20:57] fighting each other
[1:20:59] well that was the way it was in south
[1:21:00] africa and before he knows about it
[1:21:05] but you know i would sit there in the
[1:21:07] corner
[1:21:09] and i would listen and i would desire
[1:21:14] not to have the fights and all those
[1:21:16] things but just what i was listening to
[1:21:20] i decided to have
[1:21:24] what i would hear brother branham say
[1:21:26] yeah
[1:21:28] after a while as i grew up because i you
[1:21:31] know i grew up under this environment
[1:21:34] i started knowing the quotes
[1:21:37] and i could then also sit with brothers
[1:21:42] and show how intelligent i am
[1:21:47] and i could sometimes also argue and out
[1:21:49] quote
[1:21:51] the next person
[1:21:55] and i would think man you so special
[1:21:59] man
[1:22:04] but through all of that
[1:22:08] i felt empty
[1:22:13] i thought that i had a relationship
[1:22:17] with jesus because you see
[1:22:21] and this was just me right growing up
[1:22:24] under the canopy of the message all i
[1:22:27] would read a spoken word and listen to
[1:22:29] types of brother branham
[1:22:30] and i would never read this
[1:22:34] this was occasional reading
[1:22:39] three then i would study and because i
[1:22:41] knew next time we're gonna get together
[1:22:42] they're gonna come with some deep thing
[1:22:44] and i want to be ready but i felt
[1:22:48] so empty
[1:22:52] and i thought hey because of the
[1:22:55] knowledge and because you know stuff
[1:22:59] that means you know i'm spiritually i'm
[1:23:01] in relationship with jesus but you know
[1:23:03] what i came to realize afterwards
[1:23:06] i was actually in a relationship with
[1:23:09] books
[1:23:10] and with tapes and with
[1:23:14] i'm going to say this books and tapes
[1:23:17] and just
[1:23:18] the letter of the quote
[1:23:22] that was my relationship i thought i was
[1:23:24] in a relationship with jesus christ
[1:23:26] i thought i knew him but my life
[1:23:31] was empty
[1:23:36] god eventually worked in my heart and i
[1:23:39] went to go find myself
[1:23:41] a message church and i started then
[1:23:44] associating again with believers in
[1:23:47] fellowship
[1:23:48] my parents eventually followed me today
[1:23:52] thank the lord
[1:23:53] my parents are pioneers they store warts
[1:23:56] in the fellowship back in south africa
[1:23:58] so i i went there
[1:24:00] and i i started you know just meeting up
[1:24:03] with believers
[1:24:05] still having this perception
[1:24:08] that you know the more i know the more
[1:24:11] spiritual i am
[1:24:14] but i remember the day
[1:24:18] my life changed
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:23] because you see i because i grew up
[1:24:26] under a message environment
[1:24:29] and because i knew the quotes of brother
[1:24:31] branham
[1:24:33] i knew how to act
[1:24:36] in front of message people
[1:24:40] so i had this some kind of
[1:24:44] message lifestyle no life to it
[1:24:49] right no life just a
[1:24:52] style of uh
[1:24:55] you know we don't the brothers don't
[1:24:57] wear shorts and
[1:24:58] you know sisters we don't cut our hair
[1:25:00] so i i
[1:25:01] i sort of portrayed all of that
[1:25:04] to the people out there but i was empty
[1:25:10] and i remember going to a convention
[1:25:15] in fact it was a camp like this
[1:25:20] and uh it was in 1994.
[1:25:24] it was over there the christmas time
[1:25:27] and uh we had some good meetings
[1:25:34] now remember going into the into the
[1:25:38] into the hall
[1:25:40] and you know walking in i'm a young man
[1:25:42] right
[1:25:44] so i'm kind of cool i think i'm cool
[1:25:49] my wife and i always tell people this my
[1:25:52] wife and
[1:25:52] her family thought different
[1:25:59] they thought that brother tears was some
[1:26:01] kind of geek
[1:26:03] it was like weird
[1:26:07] but i thought i was cool and you know i
[1:26:09] i would and brother
[1:26:11] one years reminded me i spoke about this
[1:26:14] in london
[1:26:15] you remind me what i said and i remember
[1:26:17] i used to um
[1:26:19] you know i was one of those guys i used
[1:26:20] to like to have my hair but long
[1:26:23] and i would have that round brush and
[1:26:26] the blow dryer
[1:26:30] and then i would stand in the morning
[1:26:33] i needed to get my curls right
[1:26:37] and uh i would have like what do you
[1:26:39] call those things
[1:26:40] a little bit long here at the back but
[1:26:43] just just
[1:26:44] long enough or short enough so that the
[1:26:47] believers wouldn't notice it
[1:26:52] so i i remember you know just
[1:26:55] going to church i remember going into
[1:26:58] that meeting
[1:26:59] and i remember still sitting down and
[1:27:01] you know you're slouching
[1:27:03] kinda you know just checking what's
[1:27:05] gonna happen yeah
[1:27:06] but oh not checking what's gonna happen
[1:27:08] but knowing what's gonna happen you know
[1:27:10] it's gonna be a normal message
[1:27:14] service
[1:27:17] you know so the minister's gonna come up
[1:27:18] and he's gonna
[1:27:21] read the scripture obviously and then
[1:27:24] we're gonna hear some great stories
[1:27:25] about brother branham
[1:27:27] and we're gonna hear some awesome quotes
[1:27:31] and you see the meetings that i used to
[1:27:33] attend man it was wild
[1:27:36] but there's a quote that i nothing
[1:27:38] another they use that quote fairly but
[1:27:39] for the random says in expectations i'll
[1:27:42] rather have wildfire
[1:27:44] and no fire at all so these people in
[1:27:47] these meetings said
[1:27:48] man it was wild
[1:27:52] so i'm i'm sitting there in that meeting
[1:27:55] right
[1:27:56] the minister is preaching and i'm
[1:27:59] sitting there like this and everyone is
[1:28:02] on their feet
[1:28:03] and everyone is jumping and they're
[1:28:05] standing in front and they're aiming the
[1:28:07] minister
[1:28:08] i'm i'm sitting there now i'm obviously
[1:28:11] feeling a bit uncomfortable
[1:28:14] because i thought i'm spiritual writing
[1:28:16] here these people are
[1:28:17] all excited and i'm sitting there after
[1:28:20] a while i just stand up and
[1:28:22] you know just because everyone's doing
[1:28:24] it
[1:28:26] but you know what god
[1:28:29] he is so wonderful
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:35] because even though i sat there and i
[1:28:38] pretended like
[1:28:39] you know other people were pretending
[1:28:41] this was going crazy
[1:28:43] a meaning in having no idea what the
[1:28:45] minister's saying
[1:28:49] and in fact that service was a six hour
[1:28:52] service
[1:28:55] six hours you remember that very
[1:28:58] six hours six hour service
[1:29:03] but i remember it was the
[1:29:07] twenty um i've got the date here
[1:29:10] the 25th of december
[1:29:15] 1994 that was the day
[1:29:20] that god changed that is why i can say
[1:29:25] yeah
[1:29:25] i was one way now i'm completely
[1:29:28] different
[1:29:29] something supernatural happened to me
[1:29:33] and it was at a camp
[1:29:37] i remember sitting in my sheet
[1:29:41] and the noise was going on and people
[1:29:44] were going crazy
[1:29:46] but god was zeroing down
[1:29:49] on tears and tears was sitting there
[1:29:53] after a while test started sitting up
[1:29:57] now i was very unemotional and you know
[1:30:00] now i'm very emotional i never used to
[1:30:04] cry
[1:30:05] because crying was for sissies right
[1:30:09] and i remember sitting there and there
[1:30:12] was a sister actually just a couple of
[1:30:14] seats away that
[1:30:15] she had an eye on me so i was sitting
[1:30:18] there like this
[1:30:20] and after a while i started sitting up
[1:30:22] and then
[1:30:24] i felt a teardrop
[1:30:28] and i thought what's happening yes i
[1:30:29] went quickly
[1:30:31] make sure no one's looking and then the
[1:30:34] next year came
[1:30:36] and the next year came and after a while
[1:30:40] it was like
[1:30:41] a damn head burst and then the sister
[1:30:45] that liked me was
[1:30:46] and she started she sent some tissue
[1:30:47] papers across
[1:30:49] man i was i was embarrassed
[1:30:52] but something was happening to me
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:31:01] i had come into that meeting
[1:31:05] maybe call me a dead stick
[1:31:08] had all this information in my head
[1:31:12] but nothing real
[1:31:16] it was all just good quotes
[1:31:21] but then something happened
[1:31:25] to tess on the 24th of december
[1:31:29] 1994 i still remember the shirt brother
[1:31:33] could ben
[1:31:34] that i had on so profound
[1:31:41] was that event
[1:31:47] the people were still going crazy all
[1:31:49] around me
[1:31:51] but something was happening
[1:31:55] to me i couldn't help after a while
[1:32:00] i just stand close my eyes
[1:32:04] and just worship i never used to worship
[1:32:07] i never used to raise my hands but
[1:32:10] something within
[1:32:13] just pushed my hands up
[1:32:16] i just couldn't help but worship
[1:32:20] but thank him
[1:32:22] [Applause]
[1:32:23] and i walked away from that meeting
[1:32:27] knowing that something supernatural
[1:32:32] happened because
[1:32:35] then dan started reading more of the
[1:32:38] bible
[1:32:40] and you know what and i hope it's okay
[1:32:42] for me saying this
[1:32:44] when brother branham says he says the
[1:32:46] bible became a new book to him
[1:32:48] now i identify with that words
[1:32:51] because i always when i used to read the
[1:32:54] bible
[1:32:55] i'd always read scriptures but i could
[1:32:58] never
[1:32:59] ever see myself in the word
[1:33:03] whenever i would read something it's
[1:33:05] about somebody else
[1:33:06] i would see the posture the minister the
[1:33:10] deacon
[1:33:11] my mom and my dad
[1:33:14] never me but once god
[1:33:18] changed my life
[1:33:22] i the bible became
[1:33:25] a loving book to me
[1:33:31] the quotations that i then started
[1:33:33] reading
[1:33:34] it became life to me
[1:33:39] now between 1994 and now did i have my
[1:33:42] ups and downs and
[1:33:43] did i have my struggles did i have my
[1:33:46] failures
[1:33:47] yes i did but he was helping me
[1:33:51] and he was maturing me and he was
[1:33:53] helping me
[1:33:54] to grow
[1:33:59] so i can say today that i
[1:34:02] am a product
[1:34:06] not of the letter of the message
[1:34:10] but of the life of this
[1:34:14] precious message
[1:34:18] has changed me transformed me
[1:34:22] and that's the desire i have for my own
[1:34:24] children
[1:34:27] me and my wife we always talk
[1:34:30] and we say we can go evangelize
[1:34:33] everywhere out there
[1:34:37] but we always say lord help us not to
[1:34:40] forget
[1:34:41] our own home
[1:34:45] start in my home
[1:34:51] so this message
[1:34:55] became real it became
[1:34:59] life you see
[1:35:02] i was destined to fly
[1:35:07] foreverless
[1:35:10] i wasn't destined
[1:35:15] like a chicken in the barnyard
[1:35:20] i was called for better things than that
[1:35:25] and you are called for better things
[1:35:28] than that
[1:35:31] you're not a chicken
[1:35:37] so if the devil tries to tell you a
[1:35:40] chicken
[1:35:42] you tell the devil devil shut up
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:52] he's called me to be an eagle to fly the
[1:35:55] heights of the world
[1:35:57] i'm thankful to almighty god that he
[1:36:00] allowed me to hear the voice
[1:36:04] behind the voice to hear the voice of
[1:36:08] god
[1:36:08] calling me and i'm grateful
[1:36:12] that i responded
[1:36:17] it's so important to respond
[1:36:24] i think i don't have it here there's a
[1:36:27] quotation of brother branham
[1:36:29] where he's talking and
[1:36:33] god is moving you know where the brandon
[1:36:36] had this discerning
[1:36:38] discern and god was
[1:36:41] moving over somebody and brother branham
[1:36:46] said god is moving
[1:36:49] won't you respond and i think the person
[1:36:53] didn't
[1:36:54] respond initially but then the holy
[1:36:58] ghost
[1:36:59] in brother branham he made brother
[1:37:02] branham call out the person's name
[1:37:04] and then she probably reacted it's very
[1:37:08] important
[1:37:09] to respond
[1:37:13] when god is calling you when god is
[1:37:16] trying to
[1:37:17] to catch you like we heard this morning
[1:37:19] when he's trying to
[1:37:20] catch your attention it's
[1:37:23] very important respond
[1:37:27] the scripture said in paul freddy said
[1:37:29] that this morning author moses turned
[1:37:32] and responded then
[1:37:35] god spoke to him
[1:37:41] now this word as we know
[1:37:45] has got transformation
[1:37:49] power
[1:37:54] it can take a fully stinking sunnah
[1:38:10] make them the most humblest of
[1:38:14] christians
[1:38:16] i don't know most of you know brother
[1:38:17] matt oval
[1:38:19] in our local assembly
[1:38:22] he was a drag alcoholic
[1:38:26] but god took that man turned
[1:38:30] his life around and today he's a
[1:38:33] minister
[1:38:34] of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:38:38] so this word has got transformation
[1:38:42] power
[1:38:44] i want you to know that i want you to
[1:38:46] receive that
[1:38:48] because when you leave this camp the
[1:38:50] enemy is going to come
[1:38:52] after you no doubt
[1:38:58] you know what this word did it took
[1:39:02] an impulsive peter
[1:39:06] gave him an upper room
[1:39:10] experience
[1:39:14] turned the life of peter around
[1:39:18] so that he became the spokesperson
[1:39:22] and could give you and me the
[1:39:23] prescription
[1:39:25] as brother branham puts it
[1:39:29] i read the scripts he took this word
[1:39:33] took a soul
[1:39:36] that was persecuting the church of god
[1:39:41] took us all on his way to damascus
[1:39:46] had his damascus road experience
[1:39:51] something real
[1:39:56] more than emotion something
[1:39:59] real
[1:40:04] and turned him into a poor
[1:40:08] an apostle of jesus christ a prisoner
[1:40:13] of jesus christ
[1:40:16] it took a moses a cowardly moses
[1:40:21] running from pharaoh
[1:40:25] to have a burning bush
[1:40:28] experience
[1:40:31] that changed moses that throne
[1:40:36] moses from a coward
[1:40:40] to a one-man invasion
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:45] that's what the word of god is
[1:40:48] able to do
[1:40:51] one more two more it took
[1:40:56] a deceiving jacob
[1:41:01] to read about jacob deceiver
[1:41:07] to have a wrestler
[1:41:11] for the angel
[1:41:14] and you'd walk away a different man
[1:41:19] with a limp but a prince
[1:41:22] with god
[1:41:27] one more this word
[1:41:33] took a tasman
[1:41:36] that was just a normal message member
[1:41:41] living a normal message lifestyle
[1:41:45] just walking like message people walk
[1:41:49] turned tesla's life around
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:41:56] so now casual loves a message
[1:42:00] life not a lifestyle
[1:42:05] a life is something that's alive
[1:42:12] message influenced influence brother
[1:42:13] branham says
[1:42:15] once i was a sinner
[1:42:19] i'm saved by the grace of god
[1:42:24] i know something happened to me
[1:42:28] i identify with those words i know
[1:42:31] something happened to me you can call it
[1:42:34] holy roller
[1:42:36] or you can call it whatever you wish to
[1:42:40] but it saved me 50 some odd years ago
[1:42:45] and at the end it gets better
[1:42:48] all the time is that you can you
[1:42:51] identify with it
[1:42:53] it gets sweeter as the days go by
[1:42:58] it just gets better and better and
[1:43:01] better
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:05] give the lord a hand of praise
[1:43:08] this is real
[1:43:18] it gets better all the time he says so
[1:43:21] i enjoy it and that is about being a
[1:43:25] christian
[1:43:27] it's not boring it's not a drag
[1:43:32] it's real
[1:43:35] it's real it's real
[1:43:41] and i enjoy being a christian
[1:43:45] i enjoy telling the devil to go
[1:43:48] [Applause]
[1:43:49] and i enjoy seeing him running
[1:43:51] [Applause]
[1:44:00] random says someone says
[1:44:03] you've done gone crazy
[1:44:07] i said well then leave me alone
[1:44:12] i'm bitter off this way if you want to
[1:44:15] call me crazy
[1:44:17] call me crazy i'm better off this way
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:23] he says i'm better off this way
[1:44:26] than i was the other way
[1:44:31] now if there's still some here tonight
[1:44:34] that's the other way
[1:44:36] i want to encourage you come on
[1:44:40] this way it's better
[1:44:47] i'm better off this way than i was the
[1:44:49] other way
[1:44:51] so just let me stay the way i am i feel
[1:44:54] better this way and
[1:44:58] i'm doing better
[1:45:01] so an encounter
[1:45:05] with a supernatural god
[1:45:09] it changes your life
[1:45:14] completely
[1:45:16] then when you sing that song the things
[1:45:18] i used to do
[1:45:21] i do them no more
[1:45:25] you won't be singing a lie
[1:45:28] because a lot of times you know we sing
[1:45:30] lies
[1:45:32] but then you can sing with a true
[1:45:35] conviction
[1:45:37] because you know that he has changed
[1:45:40] your life so i said with moses
[1:45:44] it changed moses life that he became a
[1:45:47] one-man
[1:45:49] invasion he changed paul's life
[1:45:53] and paul shook the world
[1:45:58] he changed tests and i tell you tears
[1:46:01] right now
[1:46:03] is shaking
[1:46:07] i'm telling you that because i know
[1:46:10] who i am
[1:46:16] listen to brother adrian out there in
[1:46:19] europe
[1:46:20] god changed a brother adrian gray
[1:46:39] that's what god does
[1:46:42] and is doing amongst his people
[1:46:48] brother branham says here brother and
[1:46:51] sister
[1:46:53] there is a secret place that every
[1:46:56] believer should go
[1:46:58] he says the back side of the desert
[1:47:01] there on those
[1:47:02] sacred sins he says oh
[1:47:05] no doctor of theology no greek
[1:47:09] or hebrew scholar no school or seminary
[1:47:12] they might
[1:47:13] twist you all up in these kind of things
[1:47:17] but if you ever met
[1:47:20] god on those sacred sins
[1:47:25] satan can't put his feet on themselves
[1:47:30] you see you know
[1:47:34] that you met god
[1:47:38] you know i know
[1:47:42] that's why i can stand you with boldness
[1:47:46] because i know i met him
[1:47:50] you talked to god yourself
[1:47:56] you had an experience
[1:47:59] yes then he says
[1:48:03] in in him and let me stop you this often
[1:48:06] and say this that each one of you people
[1:48:10] that's been born again of the holy
[1:48:12] spirit
[1:48:14] now i identify with this quote he says
[1:48:17] you remember
[1:48:18] the very hour where the holy spirit
[1:48:22] the very spot where he met you
[1:48:26] and when doubts come now
[1:48:31] i know for many of us here this weekend
[1:48:34] god met us he did something special
[1:48:38] but the branham says when doubts come
[1:48:42] and doubts welcome
[1:48:47] and fears begin to rise
[1:48:51] and fears are going to rise he says
[1:48:55] there's always that certain place
[1:48:58] that you can come back to that time
[1:49:03] where you met god
[1:49:06] and he says it's where you met god
[1:49:09] and you talked to him you know
[1:49:12] you met god on those sacred sands
[1:49:17] it's very important you need to know
[1:49:20] that you know that you know that you
[1:49:24] met god
[1:49:28] and you will see it in your life you'll
[1:49:31] see the change in your life
[1:49:34] you'll see the change in your appetite
[1:49:37] the things that you desired for in the
[1:49:39] past
[1:49:40] all of a sudden you don't have that
[1:49:43] desire
[1:49:44] anymore something real
[1:49:47] happened
[1:49:52] now the devil i said earlier the devil
[1:49:57] is a liar
[1:50:00] and i want you to receive that
[1:50:04] the devil is a liar
[1:50:08] hey satan
[1:50:12] was wounded at calvary
[1:50:17] his head was bruised
[1:50:20] his back was broken
[1:50:24] his sting was removed
[1:50:28] now imagine the person with a broken
[1:50:30] back
[1:50:33] walk bobby in a wheelchair
[1:50:36] cursed head
[1:50:40] that's your enemy
[1:50:45] now this enemy will try
[1:50:48] everything that he can
[1:50:52] to stunt your growth
[1:50:56] to stunt your growth means that you grow
[1:50:59] until a certain point
[1:51:01] and that's where you stop now this word
[1:51:05] is taking us higher and higher and
[1:51:08] higher
[1:51:09] now the enemy is going to want to do
[1:51:13] everything that he can especially
[1:51:17] after god did something for you this
[1:51:19] weekend
[1:51:22] that day on calvary brother branham says
[1:51:24] what did he do he says
[1:51:25] god zeroed in on calvary
[1:51:28] he wounded that animal called satan
[1:51:32] forever
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:38] since then because
[1:51:41] it brought light to the human race
[1:51:45] and anyone knows that a wounded animal
[1:51:50] is at its most vicious
[1:51:54] crawling around brother branham says
[1:51:57] with his
[1:51:57] back broken now satan was locked out
[1:52:02] at calvary but his vicious
[1:52:06] is forthy and he wants to get you
[1:52:10] especially the young people he wants to
[1:52:12] get you
[1:52:14] and i believe this weekend you are
[1:52:17] leaving this weekend equipped and ready
[1:52:20] and the lord told me
[1:52:21] to to present this to you tonight
[1:52:27] he's going to try everything that he can
[1:52:33] to get you to get you to make a mistake
[1:52:37] to get you to feel guilty to get you to
[1:52:39] do all sorts of things
[1:52:43] the devil will come and tell you
[1:52:47] that you are nothing but i want you to
[1:52:50] know
[1:52:51] that the devil is a liar
[1:52:56] so when he comes and he tells you you
[1:52:59] are nothing
[1:53:01] you talk back to him and you say devil
[1:53:04] you are
[1:53:04] liar
[1:53:10] the other thing he might tell you is
[1:53:13] you're not a good christian
[1:53:16] you're not a good christian
[1:53:20] because you're not a good christian you
[1:53:22] might as well just continue doing what
[1:53:24] you're doing
[1:53:26] now god will and can come and tell you
[1:53:30] that you're not a good christian but
[1:53:33] god's
[1:53:34] objective is to help you to grow
[1:53:39] the enemy's objective to tell you not a
[1:53:43] good christian
[1:53:44] he wants you to go further down
[1:53:48] so when you go out there and the devil
[1:53:51] comes and tells you
[1:53:52] you're not a good christian you tell him
[1:53:56] therefore you are a liar
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:04] the other thing he'll tell you is that
[1:54:07] nothing
[1:54:08] really happened to you
[1:54:11] at the camp
[1:54:14] it was all just a bunch of
[1:54:17] emotion you just cried a bit some snot
[1:54:21] was running and
[1:54:23] tears nothing really happened
[1:54:28] when the devil comes and he tells you
[1:54:30] that
[1:54:32] say devil you a liar
[1:54:36] i won't listen to you i know what
[1:54:40] happened to me
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:47] he tried to give you my battles
[1:54:50] you try to mess around with your mind
[1:54:54] you try to tell you all sorts of things
[1:54:56] but you just telling devil
[1:54:58] but the tears said i must tell you you
[1:55:01] are liar
[1:55:10] and why are we on that thing about the
[1:55:12] devil coming and giving us all these
[1:55:14] thoughts there's a scripture in the
[1:55:17] bible
[1:55:18] galatians chapter 6
[1:55:22] and verse 3. that scripture says
[1:55:27] for if a man think himself
[1:55:32] to be something
[1:55:35] when he is nothing
[1:55:39] he deceiveth
[1:55:42] himself i think of that when a man
[1:55:47] or woman think themselves
[1:55:51] to be something
[1:55:54] when they're nothing
[1:55:57] they the scripture says
[1:56:00] he deceiveth himself
[1:56:05] so that is the man or woman that's
[1:56:08] walking around
[1:56:11] thinking on something when
[1:56:14] he or she is nothing but that person is
[1:56:18] walking under
[1:56:19] an atmosphere of deception
[1:56:26] and it's not the devil that is deceiving
[1:56:29] that person
[1:56:33] it's not even the friend that's
[1:56:35] deceiving
[1:56:37] that person the bible says
[1:56:40] for if a man thinketh
[1:56:44] himself to be something when he is
[1:56:48] nothing he deceiveth
[1:56:54] himself
[1:56:56] so the moral of the story of the
[1:56:57] scripture
[1:57:00] think the right
[1:57:03] thoughts
[1:57:06] don't walk around
[1:57:10] under an atmosphere of deception
[1:57:17] because the enemy is going to feed it
[1:57:22] and he's going to fan the fire
[1:57:25] and he's gonna make you feel worse and
[1:57:27] worse and worse and worse
[1:57:29] doesn't matter what comes in you define
[1:57:33] the enemy
[1:57:37] i'll tell you what to think of caesar
[1:57:38] philippians 4 8 finally brethren
[1:57:42] whatsoever things are true
[1:57:47] whatsoever things are on us
[1:57:51] whatsoever things are just
[1:57:54] whatsoever things are pure
[1:57:57] whatsoever things are lovely
[1:58:00] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:58:03] if there be any virtue
[1:58:07] and if there be any place
[1:58:10] think on these things
[1:58:15] i want to encourage you this evening
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:19] don't allow negative thoughts to come
[1:58:21] into your head
[1:58:23] defy it say
[1:58:26] go back to where you came from
[1:58:30] devil you a liar i'm a son of god
[1:58:34] i'm a daughter of god i am more than an
[1:58:38] overcomer
[1:58:40] and the devil is under my feet
[1:58:54] he's under my feet
[1:58:59] you know in the book of first kings
[1:59:02] chapter 23 it talks about and i'll be
[1:59:06] closing off shortly
[1:59:08] it talks about naboth
[1:59:12] and it talks about ahab
[1:59:16] and it talks about a neighborhood
[1:59:21] having an inheritance
[1:59:25] given to him by his father
[1:59:29] and the inheritance was a vineyard
[1:59:36] now ahab desired
[1:59:40] the vineyard of naboth
[1:59:45] and he came to naboth
[1:59:48] and he says neboth give me
[1:59:53] your vineyard and i will give you
[1:59:57] something else in return
[2:00:03] i'll give you money or whatever the
[2:00:05] scripture says
[2:00:06] but ahab wanted that vineyard
[2:00:11] and he was prepared to pay nabath
[2:00:14] for that vineyard but you see naboth
[2:00:18] i believe was a believer
[2:00:22] that stood his ground
[2:00:27] you see naboth had an inheritance
[2:00:32] that was given to him
[2:00:36] by his father
[2:00:40] and they both said
[2:00:43] i actually read the scripture says and
[2:00:46] naboth said to ahab the lord
[2:00:50] forbid me that i should give the
[2:00:54] inheritance
[2:00:56] of my fathers unto thee
[2:01:00] now that is what the devil is going to
[2:01:03] try
[2:01:04] to do to you
[2:01:08] he's going to come and he's going to
[2:01:10] offer you
[2:01:12] many other things that looks enticing
[2:01:17] but i want to encourage you today that
[2:01:20] when that happens
[2:01:23] you stand your man like a son of god
[2:01:27] and you say god forbid
[2:01:33] i will not let go of what has been given
[2:01:37] to me
[2:01:39] because what is mine brother andy is
[2:01:44] [Applause]
[2:01:48] mine
[2:01:52] you see the gates of hell is against you
[2:01:56] especially the young people i look at
[2:01:58] you i
[2:01:59] i say man you guys are just so awesome
[2:02:04] and then this i look at and i know many
[2:02:06] of you
[2:02:08] that's what i'm looking decide because
[2:02:09] this is where i see most of the young
[2:02:10] people
[2:02:13] i know a lot of you and there's some
[2:02:16] greatness
[2:02:18] within you
[2:02:22] you have the ability to shake
[2:02:26] this whole new zealand
[2:02:30] it's in you
[2:02:34] it is with andy
[2:02:35] [Applause]
[2:02:38] so don't allow the enemy
[2:02:42] to rob you and any other young people
[2:02:45] here
[2:02:45] or here or parents or moms or dads or
[2:02:49] grandparents
[2:02:50] don't allow the enemy to rob you
[2:02:53] [Applause]
[2:02:55] of what you have
[2:03:01] because you see i have been i've been to
[2:03:02] many many many many many
[2:03:04] too many many camps and i've i've
[2:03:08] i've been one of those coming out of the
[2:03:10] altar crying
[2:03:13] and i've had friends with me
[2:03:18] but i thank god that for me it was so
[2:03:20] real
[2:03:21] that when i walked away
[2:03:24] nothing that the devil could try to do
[2:03:27] to me
[2:03:28] would work because something real
[2:03:31] happened i've got a brother-in-law in
[2:03:35] fairness brother-in-law as well
[2:03:37] in london gerard
[2:03:40] he came from wherever he was came to
[2:03:42] portray his house
[2:03:43] lived in their house he came there as a
[2:03:46] sinner
[2:03:47] he's seen something real in the life of
[2:03:50] the family
[2:03:52] that changed his life completely he had
[2:03:55] a definite experience
[2:03:57] with a supernatural god
[2:03:58] [Applause]
[2:04:05] so hell is going to come up against you
[2:04:10] but i want you to know as powerful as
[2:04:12] hell
[2:04:13] is because when the brandon tells us he
[2:04:15] says the enemy
[2:04:16] is powerful as powerful
[2:04:20] as the enemy is a god
[2:04:24] that's within you and in me
[2:04:28] is more powerful
[2:04:32] than the most powerful demonic force
[2:04:36] that's out there
[2:04:43] the musicians can come and i will just
[2:04:44] read this quote
[2:04:50] in the message the great
[2:04:53] and mighty conqueror i love this quote
[2:05:00] brother branham says
[2:05:04] he says man
[2:05:08] was refused from heaven
[2:05:12] he says man was refused
[2:05:16] from heaven he says
[2:05:22] the highway to heaven
[2:05:25] was closed
[2:05:30] he says there was no highway
[2:05:35] but where there was no highway
[2:05:38] he our great lord jesus he come
[2:05:43] to make one
[2:05:46] then brother branham talks and he
[2:05:49] dramatizes
[2:05:51] and he talks about the earth and he
[2:05:54] talks about
[2:05:55] the coverings over the earth so he says
[2:06:00] the first line over the earth he says
[2:06:05] was demons of doubt
[2:06:10] demons of doubt
[2:06:14] that will make you want to doubt your
[2:06:17] experience
[2:06:19] make you want to doubt what god did
[2:06:23] he says the first line was demons of
[2:06:26] doubt
[2:06:27] he says the next was prejudice
[2:06:32] the next was selfishness
[2:06:36] pictureless demons
[2:06:40] demon powers all over the earth
[2:06:45] the next was prejudice the nix
[2:06:48] was selfishness this earth
[2:06:53] was covered over
[2:06:56] with lines of demon
[2:07:00] power then sicknesses
[2:07:05] and diseases that's what abandoned
[2:07:08] brings that picture for us
[2:07:10] it says the earth covered over
[2:07:14] with demonic forces he says there was no
[2:07:18] highway
[2:07:21] to god demon powers all around
[2:07:28] he says
[2:07:31] when he arose
[2:07:37] he says he was triumph
[2:07:43] and as he went up
[2:07:47] hey man
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:51] he broke every
[2:07:55] devil power that holds
[2:07:59] over man
[2:08:02] that skit that they showed you
[2:08:07] has made it possible
[2:08:10] for you and me to love an overcoming
[2:08:14] life
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:21] he broke every devil
[2:08:24] power that holds over man
[2:08:27] the mighty conqueror
[2:08:32] he stands alone this morning
[2:08:37] and between him
[2:08:40] and every believer is the blessed
[2:08:44] old highway of holiness
[2:08:48] that the righteous the righteous
[2:08:52] shall walk on
[2:08:56] brother branham says there's not
[2:08:59] a way of escape
[2:09:03] he says there's only one line
[2:09:07] cut down he says from glory
[2:09:12] now remember we said lines
[2:09:15] of demon powers he broke through
[2:09:20] brother branham says there's only one
[2:09:22] line
[2:09:23] cut down from glory
[2:09:27] brother branham says he left the bloody
[2:09:32] footprints
[2:09:35] but the brand name says and as he walked
[2:09:40] he says here as he walked through the
[2:09:43] corridors
[2:09:45] of the demon powers
[2:09:48] he made a highway
[2:09:52] for you and for me all the way
[2:09:57] through it so as
[2:10:00] you when you leave this camp
[2:10:04] when you leave this camp as you're
[2:10:07] walking
[2:10:10] you're walking you're watching those
[2:10:14] bloody footprints
[2:10:17] that is set for you
[2:10:21] and for me and as you walk in
[2:10:25] they might be demons remember he cut
[2:10:28] through the demons
[2:10:30] there might be demons decide they might
[2:10:33] be demons the side
[2:10:35] but you're walking you're walking

[2:28:49] testimony
[2:28:50] a living testimony you saw a living
[2:28:52] witness
[2:28:54] that this message works it's more than
[2:28:57] knowing quotes
[2:28:58] more than knowing scriptures but when
[2:29:00] you meet the author of the book
[2:29:02] that's when life changes and that's when
[2:29:04] life really starts
[2:29:08] he's here our jesus
[2:29:12] as the apostle peter could after the
[2:29:15] pentecost he say this is that spoken by
[2:29:17] the prophet joel
[2:29:19] it wasn't something they learned they
[2:29:21] didn't brother brown said they didn't
[2:29:22] wait in the upper room and andrew said
[2:29:24] to
[2:29:24] philip or whoever said you know i think
[2:29:26] we've been here long enough should we
[2:29:28] should we go out now no but one of them
[2:29:30] said no we're going to wait
[2:29:31] until until something happens
[2:29:34] until we know him the one we saw
[2:29:36] resurrect that comes and lives in me and
[2:29:38] lives out hallelujah
[2:29:40] and they didn't just imagine it it
[2:29:41] happened
[2:29:43] hallelujah this message
[2:29:46] releases the holy ghost upon the people
[2:29:49] it was bound by
[2:29:50] creating darkness of man but this
[2:29:53] message to call of it away
[2:29:54] and releases the holy ghost upon the
[2:29:56] people hallelujah so we can stand like
[2:29:59] peter and say
[2:29:59] i'm one of them hallelujah he's the same
[2:30:03] you know people say oh god don't do that
[2:30:04] to people no more that's a lie
[2:30:07] devil you're a liar oh the devil says

[2:30:12] he's a lying
[2:30:14] amen the woman of the world didn't stay
[2:30:15] the woman of the world after
[2:30:17] was in the prince of jesus harley she
[2:30:19] she was transformed
[2:30:21] doesn't matter where she came from she
[2:30:22] was transformed

[2:31:41] in your cell
[2:31:43] and you're waiting then one day the
[2:31:45] prison doors open

[2:32:08] position
[2:32:09] you can't sleep you're this burden of
[2:32:11] your guilt
[2:32:12] you know you're guilty because you did
[2:32:14] it you were there

[2:32:17] walk out
[2:32:18] do you think that person would just kind
[2:32:20] of stretch god whatever and just try to
[2:32:22] wander out

[2:32:45] say
[2:32:46] just accept me i'm here to change you
[2:32:48] i'm here to do a work you can't do
[2:32:51] it doesn't matter how much you've
[2:32:52] learned how many church services you've
[2:32:55] heard
[2:32:56] when you meet him he wants why did he
[2:33:00] die
[2:33:01] he wants to live in human beings he
[2:33:03] wants to have the preeminence
[2:33:05] he wants to be closer than your next
[2:33:06] breath he's got to give yourself to him
[2:33:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:33:14] i just want to say he's here
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:18] you know uh my darling was telling me a
[2:33:21] testimony was uh brother
[2:33:22] george smith and he was a good religious
[2:33:25] boy
[2:33:26] he didn't know god and brother brahm
[2:33:29] told perry greene
[2:33:31] to go meet him or other way around and
[2:33:33] perry greenwood would pray him through
[2:33:35] and he'd receive the holy ghost and he
[2:33:37] did
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:40] i can say i believe that can happen
[2:33:42] tonight
[2:33:44] i believe though i believe that if you
[2:33:48] really want him
[2:33:50] you start being to alters i'm not
[2:33:52] necessarily doing an altar call but i'm
[2:33:53] just saying
[2:33:55] you can you can pray until you're more
[2:33:58] than just emotional
[2:33:59] but something happens to you where you
[2:34:02] surrender everything you know to
[2:34:03] surrender and he gets a grip of your
[2:34:05] life
[2:34:06] hallelujah and you can get up from that
[2:34:08] spot changed
[2:34:09] and you stay changed and the next day
[2:34:11] you'll change
[2:34:12] and you just continue to be changed and
[2:34:15] you walk in power in the
[2:34:16] in his word and you're never the same
[2:34:18] person
[2:34:20] you just got to accept it
[2:34:25] so i'm going to say if you would like
[2:34:27] prayer
[2:34:28] but it's you that's got to talk to god
[2:34:31] we can pray with you but you got to talk
[2:34:32] to god
[2:34:34] i don't want to be a none of us want to
[2:34:36] be actors
[2:34:38] but a lot of actors are in message
[2:34:40] churches we don't want to be an actor
[2:34:43] drop the acting face meet the lord
[2:34:47] this is why this is why we have church
[2:34:50] people meet god
[2:34:51] walk with him become established in the
[2:34:53] faith and walk and not be tossed around
[2:34:55] hallelujah but if you know him the world
[2:34:58] could be upside down but you've got an
[2:34:59] anchor that holds
[2:35:03] what we heard tonight was a life
[2:35:06] i believe god did inspire brother taz to
[2:35:08] say these things
[2:35:10] he says just a man excited how could he
[2:35:12] not be excited
[2:35:14] hallelujah how can you not be excited
[2:35:17] when you hear about a transformation of
[2:35:18] a soul

[2:35:21] today as it was then
[2:35:23] hallelujah and i'm and i pray
