opportunities to try things out you know to go this way or that way and learn so the the purpose of this services is to give opportunity to young people to my instruments to speak to leave music to just to do all those sorts of things and hopefully analyse intimidating environment in a normal service although we've pretty much if you look at this Joshua it's almost like this is this is bigger than the services I preached to this is even daunting for me it's like all these faces spirit back [Music] so brother Joshua was going to lead us in some worship songs we have a special and then we

brother Jeremy to come up I will proclaim [Music] I will proclaim [Music] [Music] worship you [Music] hallelujah Amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise o people you have to tip your hair this morning guys amen are you happy to be here amen amen thank you musicians may you may have the seeds amen anyone god is good this has been overdue for a long time and I'm happy to be here with the young people this afternoon Amen you know you're the soldiers you're a soldier in the Lord's army every single one of you Amen you have a place and when you have a position and when God knows you God is not a general you know who just knows his squad by the squad name he just knows his squad just by the label given to that squad he knows every single one of his soldiers amen and that's you this afternoon hallelujah and you may be a small one you know going through life in the toys and you know cartoons and all of that but but when David faced Goliath yeah David use a pebble I mean a very tiny pebble I mean that pebble was just any stone and well when David picked up that pebble the Lord blessed that pebble Amen that pebble just small you know to bring down a giant right we're talking about a Philistine a giant a man who is bigger than any other man in the land people feared him a man so the things that you go through however big it may be to you a man as soon as you don't leave churches you know Jesus you know your your your kitty problems even it may seem big to you but God can use you that small pebble amen to destroy anything that's how powerful you are amen and I just want to read this verse to you because I don't have about ten minutes even I just wanted to read from Romans 12 just a second breath thank you buddy convinced now his spirit is here amen hallelujah good is good aiming oh you have babbles aiming em Romans chapter 12 verse 2 I just want to show you how special you guys are and the eyes of the Lord and the little things you have to do you know it's not by coincidence that this happened today because I had something on my heart I'm not a public speaker I don't I don't like speaking I'd rather sing I have another public speaker and there I've been escaping it talking about the word in front of a pub in front of the public for a long time I've been running from England all the way for the bank quote me when I came to New Zealand and then this happens you know I sure that's the Lord's will and I'm brother Ben preached on Sunday and as he was preaching I was saying he's saying every single thing every of every single thing that was in my heart he was saying it yeah and and and and for me that was much more of a blessing because I was it was like hearing myself preach to myself you know and then you know I told him he dried me up I have nothing new to tell you and then my dad came this morning and preached that message and he also took a portion of what I had in my heart to do so I basically have not dried up and I have nothing left nothing there but I'll just back them up this and this this afternoon with the 10 I'll just back them up I'm not I'll punctuated with what they have said but I won't put a full-stop there I'll put a comma because there's more amen so I'll read this this verse it says and be not confirmed conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God I mean I'll just read that one more time just always sinks in and be and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind as he may prove what what is that is good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen I just want to quickly say a prayer before we be we begin I would dealer than Heavenly Father we thank you for today Lord Jesus we thank you for this entire week Lord we thank you for where we are right now father what we're in Wellington Lord Jesus Lord and you picked us up for the Lord and you know that you built a church father well then we thank you Lord we raised your name on high father we lift you up Lord Lord you're not just any God now that we molded out of our own imagination or anything you will live in God Lord as you were with Joshua Lord as you were with Caleb father so are you today with us for more than we thank you Lord and we give you all the glory father father you know what's my name father you know all of our our happy moments Lord you know all of our side moments load the things that beset us father you know everything by name Lord what you have set a standard father and you have determined law that we will make it father you have determined that we will be victorious father and we are the young people here this morning Lord Lord we have the energy father we have the strength to draw our souls and slice every devil Lord every pain every sickness and strive to make our mountain and strive to take our promise father know that's why we're here this morning and we thank you for it look for Jesus Lord may you dwell with us today Lord I mean you take me out to the very Lord and the brother Jesse and brother Kenneth who were to speak after me father Lord may you clear their minds Lord may you speak directly through them Lord all this we pray and ask in the precious name of Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen let's give them a hot cup of praise okay amen I'm going to talk about I'm going to talk about war Amen I'm going to talk about the battlefield the battleground anyway so I mean really our young a man full of energy full of adventure full of a we want to go out they want to play football we're gonna play whatever interests that we have a man yeah them ambitions you know I want to be I don't know what you guys want to be maybe an astronaut or a scientist or you know you'll have your own ambitions but there's something that is lacking because the world is lacking something the world is lacking spirituality the word is lacking something that's missing from from the journey to become a happy I mean you can walk into a bookshop and you see you know self self would you call those books self care books you know how to be happy how to reach [Music] satisfaction in life you know take these 12 steps to be happy you know you know stretch out in the park and a yoga route you know to be happy yeah that's all well and good I mean if that helps you out that's that's cool but there's nothing more continuous and there's nothing more eternal than the joy you get from the word of God because all those books and all those things that you see out there it's the trying to reach a certain goal they're trying to get to something something that they know is missing yeah Amen I mean I mean that's why you can find the richest person in life oh you can have all the money in the world but before he goes to bed you pick up a bottle and drink that bottle empty to put himself to sleep Amen you find the poorest man wherever he is working hard don't know how many hours to allow the day I don't know before he goes to bed he will get that bottle and go to bed so on the opposite down on the opposite scale of society that we live in both worlds they're missing something they're missing something but we we are privileged here because we're not missing anything we have everything here so the Bible is which we should form our minds and personalities to the Bible amen we should we may not understand like like like what I said this morning we may not understand what we hear or what we see we may not get it but know this everything you need is in here and the only way to get it it's it's it's it's I know it's crazy out there you know you go to the canteen order to the restaurant to eat nobody's praying you'd only one prayer and all this weirdo I couldn't get em over there you know the conservative because you brain you cool I'm different Lord but you may feel very dry that you're not going anywhere you know that you have these treasures stacked up against you you know brother Brahim said that that that the most powerful weapon anybody can have is weapon of prayer I mean it doesn't matter how young you are doesn't matter how old you are I'm talking to the Joshua's now not to the Caleb's not to the older ones I'm talking to the young ones now and Joshua you know it wants with the energy to go and get that lense and when I mean land is not a physical mountain out there it's it's what you want it's your promise do you want a blessing or anything just go down on your knees and ask him and with sincerity and asked him Lord I'm small young I know you're real please give me an experience with you and you will build on that because the consequences of conforming to this life is not worth it I mean like like brother and I said this morning you can go out there brother Billy put the prophets son I mean it may seem like it don't deal in the preface son you know it's it's over and I'm going to heaven no he saw after witnessing all his his father's and miracles how how long am I going after his witness Oh Happy's witness on his father's miracles I mean brother the Prophet know there was still something missing it was an experience a deep thirst for the Lord he still went out and did what he had to do and then he was confronted with his in with his mortality and he ended up in that bed and that's when he realized that there was no out of the Word of God amen and today to make it more more realistic more applicable to our lives the world we live in there's no hope guys I don't want to I don't want to there's no hope you may see a guy or girl out there living life however you think like very happy smile and joyful you know coming out in New Zealand there's a situation going on no just nice even around the world is there mental health crisis is it deep mental health crisis and the government doesn't know what to do it's experiment after experiment there is a there's a research after research no one knows what's going on are the psychology student I'm in the midst of it I get taught about it the book of cycle is about this big the clinic Bible of psychology or the human problems or here a lot of pages so lots of pages and I like weight against my book claim my point is that the happiest person know that as long as you're after of the blood outside of the Word of God you will come to a point where your mind can't take the pressure of the world anything and you begin to break down slowly and you'll come to a point in life where you're not able to take that pressure anymore because you have nothing to lay your burdens in you have you have nothing to to to lean on you have family around you but you still be alone as long as you have God with you guys you don't only have something that will sustain you we're going through hard times you have something to give you I think the Prophet said unspeakable joy unspeakable something different spirit something words cannot brother aunt knows about that something words cannot describe amen that's that kind of joy that this world is looking for that he gave you and the devil will fight against it and you pebbles sitting out here you pebbles you're more than conquerors amen you're more than able hallelujah amen amen so the second part of that verse before I go the second part of that verse it says be it transformed by the renewing of your mind amen so even though it's a battle it's it's a warfare because things aren't just physical you know the mic neech's you know yeah yeah it's cool like we everything it's physical but there's two things going on there's a there's a different dimension that we don't actually see heaven and hell I hear is here there's no hell you're going under there's no heaven I don't know but heaven on earth is right here now the important part is what you tune your spirits into if you wake up in the morning and I'm telling you that I am a testimony of this I used to go out I just wake up in morning just leave the house yeah you know and things would happen things would definitely go wrong and I react to negative ways and things would happen boom you know I'm back to square one when I began to leave the house after I said a prayer I began to win battle that never I never actually took their battles I began to realize that something was really happening here there was something behind me and the move I realized that the more I realize that this button is not my own that everything that happens in our lives happens for a reason and if we don't have the right kind of backbone if we don't have the right kind of something to fall back on we'll lose all lives and losing I don't mean in losing I mean this is I'll be realistic this mental health crisis that's going on right now we will delve right in there and we will hit that ground so I think the best thing for us to do with the young was young people right now is try and find our purpose and when I say purpose I don't mean ambitiously looking for something to you know to do I mean try and find who you really are who you who you really are where the been said is before in the Old Testament is full of stories many many stories you know as you grow up you begin to read those stories you will find an identity you find someone whose life is similar to yours someone whose life is oh and this happens no that's mean I know oh oh oh that's me and then you see the Lord in that person's life and then that becomes your identity so who is the devil to come up to me like oh you can't make it well you can't you jump you can't shout like you know God doesn't love you or that's your battle that's when you have to realize who you who you are and you'll repel you're that pebble that the Lord bless when David picks that sling up and let loose and you can destroy any trial anything nothing can stand between you and your promise what whatever you need whatever whatever you want Amen God would be with you he said even before with you even with you even in you and the Lord is in you it devil has no space has no issue has nothing amen and just before I leave I see what you mean by the end elated time flies time does fly when you I'm gonna cut this down but um yeah yeah as soon as you realize find your purpose in the Word of God that's when the Lord can use you to do anything I mean you don't even have to go outside and tell people what you believe like this is the Bible this is what I do Romans 12 said this and I'm this yeah that's me you don't have to do that all you have to do is live according to the life that you have learned in the Word of God and that means even if it's a verse a day start somewhere even if your prayer come if even if your prayer is five minutes or two minutes yeah let it be Lester and you will grow as you age just say a prayer with the verse and be on your way amen and the person you meet outside you'll be they will see the glory of God and anything that you do and that's how you bless somebody that's how you that's just that's how you become a witness one way you become a witness amen amen so I just want to just before I leave I just want to read joshua 1:8 just to you I mean who's a Joshua in here are you well Joshua's amen amen hallelujah so Joshua 1 verse 8 I can find it myself yes so Joshua one verse 8 and 9 are read out II it says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe and do accordingly to all that is written therein well then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success so I would say as long as you keep this Word of God within you below to be before you any single thing that you do amen you were able to do anything that you need to do Amen you were able to control your emotions you're able to do those things you never thought you could have ever done amen and verse 9 says have I not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed so it's saying this is it's it's not telling you that nothing to make you upset or dismay you will not happen those things will definitely happen you'll come to a situation where you will fill this mail you'll feel discouraged you you you'll feel fearful but it's telling you I've given I've given you myself to help you so be not afraid because I'm there with you amen but the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest even as long as you believe that young people as long as you believe that amen anything is suppose you've won the victory amen amen less than hungry yeah that's that's my time amen amen let's give the Lord a hand clap hallelujah let's think I'm mazing Grace how sweet the sound as I write my brother Isaac no just just with the people [Music] [Music] [Music] what's grace it [Music] [Music] [Music] amen praise it all thank you brother Jeremy why are we doing this as a special service in the afternoon this is like morning service material I mean praise the Lord yeah amen our brother Andy I think our preaching job is getting as like demand is getting less and less we're gonna spread it out praise the Lord you can you can take your seats here this afternoon god bless you [Music] so the next up this afternoon we've got Jessie how you feeling feeling good these people seem a little bit scary when you first come up here but they're not really scary they're all we know them all you see they're all out nice good friends know they and they actually a very gracious crowd you know they they like you you like the immense a nice atmosphere it's a bit harder when maybe if you're up some Ernie didn't really and if they didn't like you it's hard to talk all these people like you and this is kind of a nice and there's a nice Dunham to the you know it is it's a one-sided conversation that means you get to do all the they don't really you know when you're having a conversation sometimes someone is talking a lot and you've got a great thing to say but you have to wait till they finish like say Adam Anders talking talking talking and you've got something awesome you want to say and use that thinking about what you want to say and you stop listening to him you're just waiting for him to stop so you can quickly say it and when he finishes if you're a good Christian brother you say yes good brother even actually hear what he said and then you say you're me then us together I was it just me I love brother out of mine I'm gonna hand it over to GC now and [Music] um could I please have the first slide up the scripture on Tori so today I'd like to speak about spirits and powers and um so I want to go straight into before I do this I want let's just bow our heads and we're no work here Amen Lord Jesus um thank you that we can all be here tonight Lord and please just let the service go well Lord and let me not get too nervous and let um yeah just and thank you for the word this morning water and just not me so could we go to Nixon I mean I got a scripture it's from John 1911 and jesus answered the our colors have no power it was all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he had delivered me and unto thee and hath the greater son so God's powers over everyone in the world and when you have God's power there's nothing to fear we see this ending on the Lions Den those lines couldn't touch him because he was God was in them and he had the power from Jesus even now as close as those lines got they just couldn't touch him could have balloons closes they want ya wanna go it's quite quick cuz I'm don't want to lose too much time like wanna do me I need get through my stuff I mean these um I've gotten few scriptures to read actually but they're just this one right now but truly I'm full of the same one no but truly I'm full of power by the Spirit of the Lord and of judgment and of might and to declare unto Jacob is transition and to Israel it's in mm so Lord has a lot of power and more than we think I mean he's full of power now we see this and also in Moses and the Red Sea now if you go to a beach or something you know it's gonna go up there and say oh what a betta party that's not really gonna happen but it did happen and when Moses that massive sea was huge he made it - um split into two sides so they could get across now that is a lot of power God has a model you wouldn't need a lot of power to do that yeah I've got the slide at the end so don't want to waste too much but boy um some my memory from a schoolteacher my mum we had to learn this in our Sunday school this and so some of you might not for you wrestle not against flesh and blood but against proceeding empowers and against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and there's a story that brother that this woman she was walking and she goes to bound down down by her party wish Easter party and that she know there's a spirit in there but she's partying and she's but she's just become a Christian and so she was like ah she lied or shy not maybe I can go in there and help the people find Jesus and then she wind there and came out in me and she went to brother branham's house and brother Brent and you know and he said the spirits there and then the spirit came out of her and written about like a bat who like came out of her and a bet and they saw star and their brother Brandon's brother I think it was dad screaming yep yes so and we see brother Brenda Mia who's come before on God's ministry and I had a lot of power in him hit the he raised all those people came to life through brother Brennan you know they were blind people there that receive their sight people with cancer they I was so close to dying got healed there be one there was a woman that got her eyes back and one person's League got put back open the eyes and this is from acts 26:18 to open their eyes and tune them from darkness to light and the power of Satan unto God that they may receive a forgiveness and sin and inheritance among them which are satisfied sanctified by faith that is in me now brother Branham didn't fight the people without what I was finding his support fought the spirit that was a new and I've got a slide next which is like five minutes long couldn't you've played it go down - leave get all of it you have what you have or do it half-a-cup globin only the legal Alban or all things remodeling is a baby this is the German girl that can't see she's fine all right or it's the blind girl and he's a blended mater

Lord gives Lord gave Moses power and Daniel power now I only need to give us a little past dam font gee I'm Satan that's what we need in our life is more of the power of God amen go tell John the Deaf hear the blind see the lame walk why because Christ was there he's the same yesterday today praise the Lord so next we've got brother Caleb now brother Caleb actually shared an awesome testimony to all the brothers while we were when we did and from us camping trip Luke itoki who was beer that was here now nothing you're the young guys were yet in yeah yeah and I already enjoyed his testimony that he shared um it they camp I think it was about a all they hate yeah I mean he was prayed for and then they all just they were gone I like brother Caleb I've enjoyed having him in our fellowship working is my voice sound like a squeaker can we open up can we open up to John 14 chapter no chapter 1416 it says there and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever now I would speak about it but I heard from brother Brennan that you must make scriptures simple not too complicated so I don't want to go further on that but I would like us to bow our head so you can pray dear Lord Lord I know you in this place and well I just want to say thank you so much for giving us all the opportunity to be here tonight I mean today and just want to say Lord just help me now when I speak because sometimes I stutter whenever I'm in front of in front of like a lot of people Lord just want to say please can you help me with that and all of our struggles Lord can you can I pray that you just fix them all and just touch us all tonight but today and I just want to say thank you Lord for everything early Martin in me Jesus Christ so I'm gonna be talking about my baptism and how I was baptized so when Durbin vall was was my school in Cape Town there was there was someone that came to our school who was talking about Christianity and he said something about baptism and then he moved to something completely different without like staying on it and something just said to me remember baptism remember what baptized is and I went home and asked my mom mom what is it and she said to me that it is when you when you have when you want to give your life to the Lord and when you when you when you ready and so after that I was always having this thing in me saying I want to get baptized and it's it kept on happening and kept on happening and in two months we went to Australia and we went to visit my uncle and he went see brother Gary's church and he I was I was too nervous to ask him for me to be baptized and then he said he said is if there's anyone who wants to be baptized and I was I was like oh and then I went I went and he said that one of the sisters were learning there Paul to us so now went and got I went to the pool and I wanted to get baptized so I wins I got my son in costume on I went in the water and it was very cold because it's Australia so so it was I went in the water and I was I think the devil touched me at that moment and said you're not ready you you you're a failure you're never gonna walk with the Lord and well I was I was thinking about that but it was too late and so I just went good dog into the water so but when I went in the water I I was looking up and I like froze for a second and I saw it looked like the water was frozen and there was like particles of the water and I could see the Sun a tiny bit and I just felt like like everything just released right off for me I felt like I felt like I was at overpressure tying something just poked me you know so I got out of the got out of the water went into the car opened the window and I just felt so free again I just felt and then but then my mom said to me that after you baptized you weren't feel you won't feel all the time it's like you won't feel good all the time it's worse it's worse than it was before you were baptized I mean after you baptized now so so before I was baptized my goal was to keep the Lord up and to keep the devil down but so yeah so the goal was to keep the devil down and then you know when he gets to the fall just go so so but after I was baptized when I moved back to hey well when I went back to Cape Town it's like almost like all the technology just hit me and said let us do this and like all these bad things are happening to me at school and with many different things and then my mom got the opportunity to move to New Zealand and it was it was quite a fast process it was like one month notice and the next month we gone and we had we had like three days to pack our laughs and we're gone and then when we came here I said to sister Christine this is my home and this is like this is the best place ever and I'm gonna love this place and then I met the church er which was one of the best things ever happened to me because and keeps on we don't have a church we do have churches but it isn't very nice churches if oh no no it's not very nice it's nice but it's like it's just it's [Laughter] it's different so we so the church here is as much with the churches I like the church here it was it was but but I met the schools here which of the schools aren't very nice and I'm gonna say that because that's true the school the school that I go to there's a lot of swearing there's there's bullying there's mean teachers I say mean teachers this it's pretty mean teachers yeah cuz they in Kate's on the school that I was in it wasn't it was it was a Christian school but yes it's much different and I think the one day I got peer pressured by someone they said to me that I had to sway about something I don't know like I'm not gonna say what word was obviously yeah but they wanted me to say this word and I just said no no no and I left it and now I'm just I'm just so happy that the Lord led me here without doing any of those bad things and just and like earlier earlier today when we're in brother Andy prayed for us and said about the refilling of of the Holy Ghost I I was crying because I I lifted up my hand and as soon as I lifted up my hand my hands started shaking I was like just I just felt so happy and this is one last thing I want to talk about it's about a ghost those in our house when we moved here so our shopping just arrived for quite a while ago Andrew and we were busy putting together a chair in my room and I have two walkie-talkies that were just charged and I put them in the lounge and one of them started ringing and I was and I was in the room and it just kept on ringing and I said to my mom mom can we please go check that what that was so I walked up I went we went into the room and it felt it I was first I was really scared because the walkie-talkie was ringing and then as soon as I went near it it rang again and then I looked behind me and we had there we have the laundry room right behind the laundry room was wrapped behind me and I heard something banging as hard as they could like banging against the washing machine and I was then I went to the kitchen and I said to and then just something told me just pray just close your eye I mean just pray and just pray because there is something in the house and you need to get rid of it just something told me and the I don't know where I heard it from heard it from someone someone said to me if these ghosts or something in your house and you eventually find that it's there you would feel like a shocking thing through your head like it would feel like you're here standing up and that was something I was very frightened of and then as soon as I started praying my hair it felt like my hair was like fuzzing up and it was all standing up and I said and I said I said demon get out of the house and I prayed about it but when I was busy praying I felt like I was gonna fall over like everything inside me just been numb and I was I was holding against the cupboard and I was just like me it was horrible but after that I it it left the house because I know it did because I believe it did and me and my mom went back to the room and I took the walkie talkies and then I think the Lord told us that the walkie talkies did that whenever it was flat so the walkie talkies were only ringing because it was flat and it just just just showed me that that I must always pray whenever whenever this like something bad in our house to try get rid of it and I don't know if I've got I don't know if I've gone over time but there's one quick little one about the warts simply so when I came here we had a foot washing which is the first time I've ever had it and brother been city wants to wash my feet so we went into the room and I was I was telling brother brother been pleased and washed my feet because I have water on him and I had warts I had warts I had two ingrown watts which worth me for like seven years and then I had one just like there in places and I told by the baby please don't wash my feet don't wash my feet and then we prayed and then I washed his feet and then I think week later or two weeks later I was looking at I looked at my foot and I was wondering where my warts were and I was like where's where's my wart that's and then I went to my mom which was sitting opposite me go into her I said mom I can't from my warts and she and she looked and she took my foot and she was like twisting it around and she was like she was like wondering where it was and then enemy notice that it was because of the foot washing I don't know what I don't know what I'm done with my thing I just want to close up with prayer dear Lord Lord I just want to say thank you or tonight Lord for today Lord it's been a an awesome day we just praise and worship worshiping the whole

the young people this afternoon a scone brother Josh would have come up in he's gonna sing one or two songs and then closing prayer is he where is he oh he's over there hey okay and the musicians we pull slows it's just thing I have a maker first d [Music] evil and before even began he knows yeah he knows by restart [Music] ready see where I go ever father [Music] he calls me no matter [Music] hi [Music] heeey [Music] easy [Music] he knows my name [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] he each day I get fine No every star easy [Music] Hey [Music] okay just before I pray I just wanted to share a testimony that I'm happened to me you may have your seats so what happened was this one Wednesday night I was standing I was we were standing and we were coming to church and I I didn't have anything to do in here and I know and I didn't I wasn't I'm not you really used to being outside and standing there where everyone is now so I decided I don't want to be here so I'm gonna stand back in the mother's room and I was standing there and then brother kress and brother Ben they asked me what was wrong and I said nothing was wrong but something was torturing me just telling me Sunday now it's not gonna be good you're not gonna be able to do it you're gonna you're too shy you your voice is too bad no one's gonna like it and then I was standing back there and I just started crying because I didn't know what it was and then when my mum started talking to me I noticed the devil was trying to get me back there and I he didn't want me to be standing here where I am right now he didn't want me to be here he didn't want me to do anything and then my dad came anything he was looking for me and we talked and everything and then I went and I wiped my tears off and then I came and I stood here and then after that when we were praying this morning I was still having that feeling but when brother and he said lift up your hands and if you want to be prayed lift up your hands cuz the whole he goes this year and if you want the whole ego so it'll come but not only did that happen the spirit lifts me and I said now I felt the courage to come up here and I knew I there was nothing telling me to come to not be so he knows our name and he is the maker so just like Caleb said the warts got taken away he's the one who makes everything he made the warts he made everything so you can decide if he wants to take it away so that no one ever gets it again or you can take away it away from one person for once or forever you can do anything because he made this world people think it's builders that made this church but actually no it's not the builders it's God Jay's been asking me since we've gotten eat since we were outside can we sing Jubilee I said okay then [Applause] um II [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] greed [Music] is great [Music] agreed [Music] [Music] to slavery because teachers [Music] [Applause] [Music] because visa [Music] [Applause] okay it's just um just pride before we sing uh one of our last songs if you want / if you want something to be taken away just left chance because the spirits here and it'll be taken away that doesn't have to be taking away straight away but you know just believe it'll be taken away my brother Brennan see the one guy he told the guy that he had that his eye would be restored him to be able to see and the guy kept on going back in he said I can't see and then you went he's and then he kept on going and he said but and brother Brennan said believe and then he went any was for three days he was just gone walking around saying telling everyone he can see but everyone told him no you can't and he kept on saying that but on the third day when he was in the barber chairs eyes got restored and he started running away praising the Lord the provost started the barber started running after him because his hair wasn't finished being cut so yeah just as we pray just lift up your hands the Lord will take it away if you believe [Music] Lord Jesus I come to you Lord and now tonight this afternoon Lord where it's our first youth meeting world but doesn't mean that the spirit can't be here in the first time Lord oh Lord thank you for making this successful Lord thank you God for us Lord well Joshua's Lord I believe that and it's Lord I just come and pray for everyone here who's got the hands left that up Lord may you just give them may they just believe that it would be taking away Lord and let it be taken away if it's in your world Lord and Lord I pray all these things yes I just come pray and I believe that I believe myself that everyone with their hands up everything would be taken away Lord Lord stress anything it could be one small thing Lord it can be just a look like a tiny dot or crumb good but actually but when but then when you can't see their climate anymore you want everything to be spotless Lord we want everything to be spotless and when that crown gets taken away with spotless Lord if there's a lot just it will all be taken away Lord but if there's one specific thing that everyone wants to be taken away from them may it be taken away in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may every spirit that's holding people back now tonight may just leave in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan you have no right to be in the space once Satan you don't have any right and yeah I pray that this in Jesus Christ's name Amen okay we are going now to see we're going to say he didn't
