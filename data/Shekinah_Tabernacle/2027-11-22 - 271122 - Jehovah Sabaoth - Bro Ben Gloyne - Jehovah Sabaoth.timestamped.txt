[41:58] now see if I can pronounce these names I
[42:00] don't know why I seem to pick scripture
[42:01] as well the names are like this but hey
[42:03] anyway
[42:05] um and there was a certain man of uh
[42:08] ramothy and uh zofim of Mount Ephraim
[42:11] and his name was elkana the son of Johan
[42:14] uh the son of elohu the son of uh tohu
[42:18] the son of an ephraite however you say
[42:20] that and he had two wives and the name
[42:22] of one was Hannah and the name of the
[42:23] other was uh uh pinea and pinea I had
[42:27] children but Hannah had no children and
[42:29] this man went up out of a city yearly to
[42:31] worship and do sacrifice under the Lord
[42:33] of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of
[42:35] Eli hoffney and philius uh uh Phineas
[42:38] sorry the priest of the Lord were there
[42:40] amen let's bear heads in a word of
[42:42] prayer this morning amen let's pray
[42:44] together who has a need this morning say
[42:47] Lord would you come my way amen gracious
[42:50] father that's what we desire you come

[43:08] ask me forgive us of every sin Lord
[43:10] every short falling Lord make cleanses
[43:12] of our secret faults and our iniquities
[43:14] Lord knows we all covered in your blood
[43:16] today and may you have your way in the
[43:17] service we love you so much we thank you
[43:20] we have this opportunity together as a
[43:21] people and worship your own spirit and
[43:23] truth and we just want to pray Lord
[43:25] you'll be with us Lord may also be with
[43:27] all those who are watching by the way of
[43:28] the internet as well may he be glorified
[43:30] Lord Jesus may be praised and adored and
[43:33] may we walk out of these doors changed
[43:35] and renewed and refreshed Lord may you
[43:37] grant it dear God and Jesus Christ's
[43:39] name amen I mean God bless you friends
[43:41] you can have your seats this morning so
[43:44] I want to take a word I thought it was
[43:46] very interesting where uh uh Brother
[43:48] Jimmy's uh song selection you know he uh
[43:50] he is Jehovah Lord of creation and you
[43:53] know I I really like that uh because I
[43:55] want to take this where where uh we read
[43:57] here in verse three where it says that
[43:59] they went up to
[44:01] um um went out of a city yearly to
[44:03] worship and sacrifice unto the Lord of
[44:05] hosts and Shiloh now it's very
[44:08] interesting when you look into the
[44:09] scripture where where um God you know
[44:12] many times in English we just read God
[44:13] or the Lord or something and we just
[44:15] kind of glaze over really the full
[44:17] significance of of of what this says
[44:20] here and uh so so this uh the Lord of
[44:23] hosts is is Jehovah uh sabath uh yeah I
[44:28] think it's how you said which means so
[44:30] so this is um I was reading this where
[44:31] where we are reading through uh first
[44:33] Samuel as a family and
[44:35] um
[44:36] um I just really liked what um it uh uh
[44:39] Scofield said it as notes Here uh about
[44:42] this name of God which is Jehovah's Lord
[44:44] or Lord Lord of Lord of hosts Jehovah
[44:47] sabath
[44:48] um if that's how you pronounce it for
[44:49] the distinctive meanings of um Jehovah
[44:52] um here it says now it means with a
[44:54] special uh reference to Warfare or
[44:57] service
[44:58] and and they use these two ideas United
[45:01] Jehovah uh so that means Jehovah really
[45:04] in manifestation of power so this
[45:06] Jehovah sabath means it's in reference
[45:08] to Warfare or service and when you bring
[45:10] these two uh ideas together of warfare
[45:13] or service it means Jehovah and
[45:15] manifestation of power it says in Psalms
[45:17] 24 10 the Lord of hosts he is the Lord
[45:19] Of Glory and accordingly in the Old
[45:22] Testament the scripture this name is
[45:23] revealed in the time of Israel's need
[45:25] now this is very significant because
[45:27] when we look into when this name is is
[45:29] is used in the scripture it's tied into
[45:33] um it's it's not used in the first five
[45:35] books of the Bible
[45:37] so it's not time you know yes it's not
[45:39] used when when when when when when
[45:40] Joshua um you know when when Moses comes
[45:43] and takes Israel out of out of Egypt and
[45:46] takes them into the promised land you
[45:47] know it's not used in
[45:49] um and it's not used indirectly and
[45:51] Joshua or judges and it's really used in
[45:54] the Psalms but in Jeremiah which is the
[45:56] prophet where where he prophesies when
[45:59] when Israel is approaching National
[46:01] judgment it's used about 80 times and
[46:05] then in Malachi it's used in 25 times
[46:08] and then so in the Psalms it's used
[46:10] twice
[46:12] but then it's also used in in haggai 14
[46:16] times now hey guys just two chapters now
[46:18] there's a reason I'm laboring this point
[46:20] now and in Zechariah in 14 chapters
[46:24] um Zechariah calls on the Lord of hosts
[46:27] about 50 times now this is very
[46:29] significant to me because because here
[46:31] this name is first used when when Israel
[46:35] is in a time of great crisis the the
[46:38] priesthood is backslidden the the you
[46:41] know Eli has become fat and he's just
[46:43] you know he's yo yo he's not correcting
[46:45] his sons like he should the you know the
[46:47] ministry has gone sideways the you know
[46:50] it's you know it's during a time of the
[46:52] time of judges of Revival and death and
[46:54] National problems and you know they're
[46:56] not taking the land like they should
[46:58] they're not growing as a kingdom like
[47:00] they should it's just a perpetuation of
[47:02] Revival and death you know that that you
[47:04] know that sin they'd worship the gods of
[47:06] other nations and then they would you
[47:08] know be be be uh delivered to the hand
[47:10] of those Nations then they would call
[47:12] upon God and God will send a judge
[47:13] they'd be delivered and then they'd walk
[47:15] with God for a certain amount of time
[47:16] and then they would fall into the same
[47:18] cycle of of idolatry and so on so so
[47:21] Israel was in a time of great trouble
[47:23] here yeah and and so it's very
[47:26] significant where where this is used
[47:29] because here they are in this time of
[47:31] national trouble but then here comes a
[47:33] man here now it's important when when
[47:35] when the name of God is used because
[47:37] when God reveals himself in a certain
[47:39] way the believer can access that part of
[47:41] God and so this now if I just continue
[47:44] here he says here so
[47:46] so as I said Malachi would use it 25
[47:49] times the Psalms twice and then
[47:52] Zechariah
[47:53] um
[47:55] um 14 I mean 50 times in haggai twice
[47:57] right now but then but this name gathers
[48:00] so so so if you take this whole name of
[48:02] the hosts of of the Lord being Heavenly
[48:04] and then primarily the angels are meant
[48:06] here but the name gathers into itself
[48:08] the idea of all Divine or Heavenly power
[48:11] is available for the need of God's
[48:13] people saying that all that God is is
[48:15] available during these great times of
[48:18] trouble so so haggai and Zechariah they
[48:20] lived in a time of restoration where
[48:22] where Israel was there in in Babylon 70
[48:25] years and then God said it's going to
[48:27] time for them to return and they return
[48:29] to Israel to rebuild the Temple so so so
[48:32] rebuild or restore worship and and also
[48:35] to restore Jerusalem so here was here
[48:37] was two prophets prophesying in this
[48:39] time now we know when they rebuilt
[48:41] Jerusalem was in trouble sometimes it
[48:43] wasn't a time of peace they had to
[48:45] they'd have the trail in one hand and a
[48:46] sword in the other when they were
[48:48] rebuilding the walls and and But but so
[48:50] haggai and Zechariah would would would
[48:52] speak about the lord of the Lord of
[48:55] hosts is with them saying that God all
[48:57] of God's Heavenly power was what the
[49:00] Believers to restore Israel to restore
[49:03] Jerusalem and the Temple now I think
[49:04] this is very significant because we
[49:06] understand we live in a restoration time
[49:08] so not only do we live in a time of
[49:10] trouble because we know with Jeremiah it
[49:12] was just a nation approaching judgment
[49:15] but we know in this day it's the world
[49:17] is going into judgment where soon this
[49:19] world is going to step into a Great
[49:21] Tribulation but we know before that the
[49:24] bride has raptured up into Glory where
[49:25] we don't have to go through that Great
[49:27] Tribulation time but we go to the
[49:29] wedding supper of the Lamb amen but this
[49:31] world is going into a time this whole
[49:33] world is going to a time of uh Judgment
[49:36] of of of a Great Tribulation so before
[49:39] this time because Jeremiah we know he
[49:41] prophesied before this happened and even
[49:43] when the Captivity happened but he would
[49:45] call say he's basically telling Israel
[49:47] the Lord of hosts is here
[49:50] you don't have to go into this judgment
[49:52] you can all of Heaven is there behind
[49:54] you to deliver you from going down this
[49:56] road and it's the same thing today where
[49:59] all of Heaven is present amen that we
[50:01] can go we can walk into a body change
[50:03] where we don't have to go into a Great
[50:05] Tribulation that any anything we have
[50:07] need of we can access by the blood of
[50:10] Jesus Christ
[50:11] amen now the first time now this may be
[50:14] a bit laborious this morning we just
[50:15] want to go through this slowly because I
[50:17] think sometimes we kind of take for
[50:19] granted the name of Jesus Christ
[50:21] we know it's the name of God and it's
[50:23] the name above all names but there's a
[50:25] there's the most power and all creation
[50:26] is in that name it's not just a name it
[50:29] is the name amen where the New Testament
[50:31] Church of the other prophesy though
[50:33] preach and cast out devils in his name
[50:35] and the gospel must be preached in his
[50:38] name amen until the you know into the
[50:40] world so you know there's great power in
[50:42] this name and we can see you know if we
[50:44] can look into the scripture and see that
[50:45] the god of the Old Testament is the god
[50:47] of the new it doesn't go one God in the
[50:49] old and then and then you know you know
[50:51] where Matthew 1 1 comes in then it's a
[50:53] different God it's the same god Jehovah
[50:55] of the oldest Jesus Christ of the new so
[50:58] we can draw strength from the name of
[51:00] God from the Old Testament because we
[51:01] can realize that what he was in the old
[51:03] is the shadow he's here in reality form
[51:06] that everything we have need of is in
[51:08] him and we can get access by faith into
[51:10] him now the first time that a Heavenly
[51:12] Host would be recognized in the
[51:14] scripture was when Jacob was returning
[51:16] back to his homeland and he knew that
[51:18] when he returned back there he would
[51:20] have to come and come contact with Esau
[51:22] now Esau was the one who stole the
[51:24] birthright from he was the you know Esau
[51:26] by by by order of birth had the right to
[51:29] the to to the birthright but but there
[51:31] was something in Jacob that wanted it
[51:33] above everything and that shows a real
[51:35] believer that they want the baptism of
[51:37] the Holy Ghost above all things they're
[51:39] not interested in just taking for
[51:40] grinder well I'm a Christian I go to
[51:42] church I believe the message they want
[51:44] to know him and so and so Jacob had the
[51:47] burden he must have that Birthright
[51:49] praise the Lord here's here's the here's
[51:52] the big heavy artillery for this
[51:53] afternoon praise God you're gonna be
[51:55] worried there brother Dave God bless you
[51:57] amen but yes I hear so so here Jacob he
[52:00] wanted the birthright more than anything
[52:02] now as he's returning in Genesis 32 it
[52:05] says and Jacob went on his way and the
[52:07] angels of God met him and when Jacob saw
[52:10] them he said this is God's host and he
[52:13] called the name of that place Maha name
[52:14] which means a place of two camps so that
[52:17] means that not only there was the camp
[52:18] of Jacob returning back to their
[52:20] Homeland but there was a Heavenly Camp
[52:21] so so so where they were walking there
[52:23] was an Angelic Camp going around them
[52:26] and I think this is very significant
[52:28] because if we can realize who's with us
[52:29] every day it's not you alone in this
[52:31] walk but God is with you the angels of
[52:34] heaven are with you it's very powerful
[52:36] if we realize who was with me in this
[52:38] life's journey where we would never feel
[52:40] alone
[52:41] if we realized he was with us amen that
[52:44] we are not alone he says I'll never
[52:46] leave thee nor forsake Thee I trust
[52:48] there's something in your heart saying
[52:49] that's talking about me it's not just a
[52:51] nice idea but there's something in my
[52:52] heart says I will never be alone amen
[52:55] there may not be a physical person
[52:56] around me but I am not alone because the
[52:59] Lord is with me and then so but but what
[53:01] I love about this is Jacob did not just
[53:04] recognize the Angels were there but he
[53:06] knew that in that atmosphere he could
[53:08] get a hold of someone that he could be
[53:10] changed now Jacob we know his name meant
[53:12] supplanter he was a shyster he cheated
[53:14] his brother out of the birthright he
[53:15] cheated leban out of many things and you
[53:17] know because he was living according to
[53:19] his name now there's great power and
[53:21] significance and names that's why it's
[53:23] important to always look at a meaning of
[53:25] a name before you name anyone a certain
[53:26] name and so Jacob so so Jacob needed to
[53:29] be changed so he knew in that host it
[53:31] was not only Angels God himself was
[53:33] there and he would wrestle with God all
[53:36] night until God changed him and so not
[53:39] only he wanted the birthright he needed
[53:41] real change in his walk because after he
[53:44] was touched by God he says I'll not let
[53:45] you go till you bless me where where the
[53:48] angel which is God Angelic form would
[53:50] touch him on his leg and he began to
[53:51] walk different so after God touches you
[53:54] and I we walk different we talk
[53:56] different it's not our physical step how
[53:58] has changed but it's our character it's
[54:00] our conduct it's our nature it's how we
[54:02] talk to people it's how we dress and
[54:03] different things our whole Christian
[54:05] Walkers changed after the Lord has
[54:07] touched us and so he recognized not only
[54:10] the Angels were there but God was there
[54:12] and he could wrestle with him and be
[54:14] changed and so when he went
[54:16] and he saw saw his brother Esau he was a
[54:19] different man Hallelujah why because the
[54:22] host of God was with him amen and then
[54:25] and then and then even even with the
[54:27] bride there is two camps there's this
[54:28] camper there's a Heavenly Camp around us
[54:31] praise the Lord so I you know I love the
[54:33] story of you know Elisha here where
[54:36] where the enemy has surrounded their
[54:37] city and your brother Brown would
[54:39] dramatize it where where Elisha's
[54:41] servant would go out you know in the
[54:42] morning take the milk bottles which
[54:44] people used to do once upon a time put
[54:46] them by the front gate that you know and
[54:47] then you know and then and then and then
[54:49] the servant would go out and he'd look
[54:50] and see the enemy had encamped around
[54:52] the city and then so now the servant
[54:54] began to panic because he realized we're
[54:57] done we're him done we can't get out the
[55:00] enemy's going to take the city he's
[55:01] going to kill us because he's after you
[55:02] Elijah and you know you know he was
[55:04] getting really troubled about it but
[55:06] then Elijah prayed he said Lord open
[55:08] open the Man's eyes now his prayer
[55:12] didn't cause the angels to come down
[55:14] because after the prayer the servant
[55:17] realized he he looked around so all the
[55:19] hills around the cities it was all the
[55:21] fiery Chariots of the armies of God of
[55:24] the Angelic forces were all around the
[55:26] prophet and then so now they now the
[55:29] servant was more caught up in he wasn't
[55:31] caught up in the fact that the enemy was
[55:33] there he has more caught up in whoa
[55:35] God's God's Heavenly Host is surrounding
[55:38] us now his prayer did not cause the
[55:41] armies to come down it didn't cause the
[55:43] armies to move into position it didn't
[55:45] cause them to there but it caused the
[55:48] servant's eyes to come open to what was
[55:50] already there and if our spiritual eyes
[55:53] could come open this morning see God is
[55:55] here the angels of heaven are here amen
[55:58] Jesus is here we know we'll meet him
[56:00] physically in the air right we know
[56:02] we're physically going to meet his
[56:03] physical body but his his spirit is here
[56:05] All That Heaven is is upon the Earth
[56:07] right all that Jesus is is here the
[56:10] angels of God are here so therefore all
[56:12] that God is is present in this room
[56:14] right now he would say you know where
[56:16] two or three are gathered in my name
[56:18] there I am in the midst you know if we
[56:19] could really grasp that by faith that
[56:22] he's between you and I he's between you
[56:24] and the person next year the person in
[56:26] front of you behind you he's in the
[56:27] midst of us even now his angels have
[56:29] gathered to attention they have come to
[56:31] you know when we were worshiping God
[56:32] they would just stand there and watch
[56:34] because they could maybe sing the same
[56:36] songs but the reality the revelation of
[56:38] those songs they could never sing
[56:39] because they'd never know what it's like
[56:41] to be redeemed and to be you know you're
[56:43] going to be reconciled back to God their
[56:45] sins taken away you know they don't know
[56:47] anything of you know of the atonement
[56:49] but we do
[56:50] so we can sing the praises to God that
[56:52] they could never sing because we know
[56:54] what it's like to be lost and be found
[56:56] Amen to be blind but to be able to see
[56:58] you know to be you know spiritually dead
[57:00] to be alive in Jesus Christ we we
[57:02] understand what those things are like I
[57:04] trust you do amen you can say once upon
[57:06] a time I was one way now I'm a different
[57:08] way because the Lord came and
[57:10] interrupted my life and changed me
[57:12] forever
[57:13] oh look yeah so so that cause so his
[57:16] prayer didn't make the Angels come down
[57:18] it made the servant's eyes come open to
[57:20] see who was already there amen so I pray
[57:23] that'd be the same thing with us we
[57:24] would see who's already with us now
[57:27] now let's say in Psalms 34 and 6 this
[57:30] poor man cried and the Lord heard him
[57:32] and saved him out of all his troubles
[57:34] the angel of the Lord and campeth about
[57:36] those that fear Him and delivereth them
[57:39] so our God encamps about us he doesn't
[57:41] just and and he doesn't just encamp
[57:43] about us just to like you know like
[57:45] someone's who's a spectator you know
[57:47] watching a sports game eating some
[57:49] popcorn and cheering on and no no he
[57:51] doesn't just encamp about us and walk
[57:53] with us as in some silent God that's
[57:55] just observing he's not that way in our
[57:57] lives but he is daily part of our lives
[58:00] right because because he doesn't just
[58:02] encamp around about us but he delivers
[58:04] us right so he actively intercedes on
[58:07] our needs if we have a trouble whatever
[58:09] he actively delivers us from those needs
[58:12] amen amen I mean I mean I mean from
[58:14] those problems that's what he does this
[58:16] is what our God is in the delivering
[58:18] business
[58:18] amen he is not just a silent Observer he
[58:21] doesn't just sit up in heaven with his
[58:23] his arms crossed and just watch the
[58:25] unfolding of his plan no he's actively
[58:28] involved in our lives do you believe
[58:30] that this morning amen you're going to
[58:32] believe that he's not some distant God
[58:34] the you know the devil will will try and
[58:36] make you think he's not interested in
[58:37] you he doesn't care he doesn't talk to
[58:39] you and you you know your prayers don't
[58:41] work and he's distant somewhere and you
[58:43] know that may be uh you know part of the
[58:45] devil's testimony but it's not our
[58:46] testimony no he is our helper amen he's
[58:49] our he's our he's our help in time of
[58:51] trouble right he's a present help in
[58:53] time of trouble right he always turns up
[58:55] on time according to what we need amen
[58:57] so I you know I thank God that God is
[58:59] with us amen
[59:01] Hallelujah now now Israel was in a time
[59:03] of great need when they went up to
[59:05] worship every year and so they were
[59:08] approaching a place of worship of of of
[59:10] the Lord of hosts where they could get
[59:13] everything they had need of was in was
[59:15] in Jehovah God right there now as I said
[59:17] in the beginning it's very easy just to
[59:19] gloss over gloss over when we read God
[59:22] or the Lord God or something in the
[59:24] scripture but each has a great
[59:25] significance now just to just to quickly
[59:28] do a very quick overview of this we're
[59:30] gonna we're gonna go so in Genesis 1
[59:33] it's very it's very interesting when you
[59:35] read about the order of creation where
[59:37] it says in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[59:39] God created the heavens and the earth
[59:40] now that word God there is is is Elohim
[59:45] which means object of worship just means
[59:47] god
[59:48] right now now it doesn't change until we
[59:51] come into Genesis 2 where where God is
[59:53] about to form Man Out of the Dust of the
[59:55] earth which says and the Lord God so in
[59:57] chapter one it says God made this and
[59:59] God did this and God did this but then
[1:00:01] when when man is about to be able to
[1:00:03] formed Out of the Dust the other says
[1:00:04] and the Lord God now this made you seem
[1:00:07] well that's just English it doesn't mean
[1:00:09] anything but in reality it has great
[1:00:11] significance because if we can look at
[1:00:13] what God did in the garden we can look
[1:00:15] at what God wants to do with you amen
[1:00:17] because we know in Genesis 1 1 the Earth
[1:00:19] was about form and void Darkness coveted
[1:00:21] Waters cover the face of the deep and
[1:00:22] you know it was in total darkness and we
[1:00:24] were in total darkness right but but if
[1:00:27] you read through the order of creation
[1:00:28] where it talks about botany life it
[1:00:30] doesn't say he created the seeds but he
[1:00:32] just caused them to come forth because
[1:00:34] they were already laying in the earth
[1:00:35] it's the same thing with you and I there
[1:00:37] was a seed of predestination in our soul
[1:00:39] amen before we're born it was there and
[1:00:42] but when we're born into this world we
[1:00:44] have a spiritual Amnesia we don't know
[1:00:45] who we are we don't know who our God is
[1:00:47] we don't know where we're going you know
[1:00:49] we may be raised in a Christian culture
[1:00:51] we may have a message culture whatever
[1:00:52] it is but there comes a time when God
[1:00:54] begins to brood over your life like he
[1:00:56] moved over the spirit of the waters
[1:00:58] because he knew under those Waters there
[1:01:00] was a seed amen and he wants every seed
[1:01:02] to come forth after its kind he wants it
[1:01:04] to come to full manifestation he doesn't
[1:01:07] just want to sit there as a seat saying
[1:01:08] look I've got seed now he wants it to
[1:01:10] come to life amen it's like if you're
[1:01:12] growing a garden you don't want to just
[1:01:13] leave the seeds on the Shelf you want to
[1:01:15] plant those seeds in its season that
[1:01:17] whatever you want to harvest from those
[1:01:19] seeds you'll get if you want pumpkins
[1:01:21] you put pumpkin seed in a certain time
[1:01:23] in a certain time you get pumpkins
[1:01:24] that's what you're looking for or or
[1:01:26] tomatoes or whatever it may be because
[1:01:28] you put seed in the ground it's the same
[1:01:30] thing with God not just now he's not
[1:01:32] talking about fruit and veggies now I'm
[1:01:33] talking about you and I right because he
[1:01:35] wants us to come to our full
[1:01:36] manifestation so so Darkness covered the
[1:01:39] world all those things he caused the
[1:01:40] separation of the darkness in the water
[1:01:42] to move and different things that that
[1:01:44] seed would come forth that they that
[1:01:46] that the darkness would move back and
[1:01:47] the light would would strike the seat
[1:01:49] you know strike the soil the soil will
[1:01:51] come to a certain temperature then life
[1:01:53] would germinate in the seed and it would
[1:01:55] come forth it's the same thing with you
[1:01:56] and I we're once very cold and different
[1:01:58] in darkness people
[1:02:00] right but then God began to brood over
[1:02:02] our lives we're going to move move
[1:02:04] Darkness back I mean move Waters back
[1:02:07] move judgments back move trouble back
[1:02:09] until finally amen a warmth came over
[1:02:11] our lives then what happened a new birth
[1:02:14] happened amen a seed came to life a
[1:02:17] different life that we once were living
[1:02:18] amen a new life came in
[1:02:21] Hallelujah why because he knew there was
[1:02:23] a seed in you that's why he brewed you
[1:02:25] you know that's why he speaks to your
[1:02:26] heart tries to get your attention deals
[1:02:29] with your life you know corrects you
[1:02:31] when you're wrong convicts you when
[1:02:33] you're in sin why because he wants you
[1:02:35] to come and meet him
[1:02:37] praise God Amen to this word God just
[1:02:40] means now if we you know if I have my
[1:02:42] notes here right yeah it just means the
[1:02:43] South you know Elohim is the Hebrew word
[1:02:45] for God here the self-existing one but
[1:02:48] then when but then when you know but we
[1:02:50] we know and God was attributes and him
[1:02:53] was to be a father to be a savior to be
[1:02:55] a redeemer you know to be a Healer to be
[1:02:57] a restorer to be a God to be a priest to
[1:03:00] be a counselor to be a comforter you
[1:03:02] know to be everything
[1:03:04] every attribute you know I'm just you
[1:03:06] know you know I haven't covered them all
[1:03:07] there but you know there's many
[1:03:09] attributes in them but he must Express
[1:03:10] them
[1:03:11] and then so when when man was going to
[1:03:13] be formed Out of the Dust the Earth it
[1:03:15] you know changes to the Lord God
[1:03:18] now this has significance because now
[1:03:21] remember this is not a different God so
[1:03:23] it's not and God did this and the and
[1:03:25] then then the Lord God turns up and then
[1:03:27] begins to deal with man it's the same
[1:03:28] God
[1:03:29] right it's the same God
[1:03:31] and then so now now Lord here is is
[1:03:34] Jehovah I mean Jehovah the primary
[1:03:37] meaning of the name Jehovah is a
[1:03:39] self-existent one literally as in Exodus
[1:03:41] 3 14 he that he that who is and
[1:03:44] therefore the Eternal I am but Harvard
[1:03:47] from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed
[1:03:49] signifies also to become
[1:03:51] so that is to become known thus pointing
[1:03:54] to a continuous and increasing
[1:03:56] self-revelation now combining these
[1:03:58] meanings of Harvard we arrive at the
[1:04:01] meaning of the name Jehovah which he is
[1:04:03] the self-existent one who reveals
[1:04:05] himself the name in itself and Advance
[1:04:08] upon the name of God suggests attributes
[1:04:10] of deity so here he is he was God but
[1:04:13] then when man began to come into the
[1:04:14] picture he becomes the Lord God the
[1:04:17] self-existent one who reveals himself
[1:04:19] now he the reason he changes his name
[1:04:22] here is because now he has someone upon
[1:04:24] the Earth he can reveal himself too as I
[1:04:26] said I think last Sunday he couldn't
[1:04:28] reveal himself to the birds or the bees
[1:04:30] or the trees or the whales or the
[1:04:31] chimpanzees or whatever no he could only
[1:04:34] reveal himself to part of himself
[1:04:36] because remember Adam and Eve were part
[1:04:38] of God they weren't a different kind of
[1:04:40] creation they were his offspring so now
[1:04:42] he had his offspring or part of himself
[1:04:44] upon the Earth he could make himself
[1:04:46] known to them amen that's why you know
[1:04:49] what the disciples you know after Judas
[1:04:51] left to try them different things did he
[1:04:53] begin to reveal things to the disciples
[1:04:55] he couldn't before he left because he
[1:04:57] was speaking now to his children
[1:04:59] amen so so many times God will reveal
[1:05:02] things to to us you know that's not
[1:05:04] necessarily to the world
[1:05:06] right now everyone has a potential to be
[1:05:08] saved don't get me wrong because God
[1:05:10] wants everyone to come I wish we'd have
[1:05:12] to build a stadium to have church in
[1:05:15] amen what because the Salvation would go
[1:05:17] to all corners of the earth amen that's
[1:05:19] what I would love to see not just for
[1:05:21] numbers sake but people would be saved
[1:05:22] amen this is what we want to see isn't
[1:05:24] it amen so so now so so now he has part
[1:05:27] of himself upon the Earth that he can
[1:05:29] reveal himself to and that's the same
[1:05:31] thing with you and I he is the
[1:05:33] self-existent one who reveals himself
[1:05:35] now well you could say but he's revealed
[1:05:37] himself the full Revelation is is here
[1:05:39] and that is true but is that full
[1:05:41] Revelation in you see it's one thing for
[1:05:44] it to be sitting in print form it's
[1:05:45] another thing for it to be a revelation
[1:05:46] in your heart right so he has revealed
[1:05:49] himself in print form but he has to come
[1:05:51] and make that word live in you amen
[1:05:53] because remember Jesus said when the
[1:05:55] spirit of Truth has come he'll lead you
[1:05:56] and guide you into all truth see a
[1:05:58] legion guide you into all truth of his
[1:06:00] word amen so so it's sure it was a
[1:06:03] revelation to Moses when he wrote it or
[1:06:05] any of the prophets right or the or or
[1:06:08] Paul or different ones but it's a
[1:06:10] revelation to you and I so God is the
[1:06:12] self-existent one but he wants to reveal
[1:06:14] himself to you
[1:06:15] and you're glad he's a personal God this
[1:06:17] morning amen he's not just any old guy
[1:06:19] but but he's a personal God he's not
[1:06:21] just your neighbor's God or your
[1:06:22] spouse's God he's your God Amen so he
[1:06:25] wants to reveal his attributes to you
[1:06:27] amen so we you know we understand that
[1:06:30] that that before there was any sin any
[1:06:32] trouble any sickness any death any
[1:06:34] sorrow any pain there was a God who
[1:06:36] could save heal and redeem before that
[1:06:39] amen because what is greater hatred or
[1:06:42] love love is greater what is greater sin
[1:06:46] or a savior a savior why because a
[1:06:49] savior was here before there was sin
[1:06:50] right there was a savior before anything
[1:06:53] was lost amen there was a redeemer
[1:06:55] before anything was here to be redeemed
[1:06:57] amen there was there was love before
[1:07:00] there was ever hatred right because God
[1:07:02] is Fountain of love amen so so in him
[1:07:05] were all these attributes but he needed
[1:07:07] to express them so he allowed the devil
[1:07:10] to do what he did in order for God to be
[1:07:12] fully made manifest to the Earth so you
[1:07:15] know it's a strange change thing but you
[1:07:16] really think when you really think about
[1:07:18] it Adam and Eve could only know God a
[1:07:20] certain amount
[1:07:21] because remember they were never sick
[1:07:22] they never had sorrow they were never
[1:07:25] lost they never had trouble they never
[1:07:26] felt afraid they never needed comforting
[1:07:28] they never needed guidance they never
[1:07:30] needed counsel they never needed a high
[1:07:33] priest they never needed a lamb they
[1:07:34] didn't need any blood but they didn't
[1:07:36] need any of those things before sin
[1:07:37] right but all that was in God
[1:07:40] they never needed a Shepherd because
[1:07:42] they never needed guiding so then the
[1:07:44] Devil comes along he and God knew it was
[1:07:48] going to happen he allows it to happen
[1:07:50] and then now the World falls under sin
[1:07:52] and then God actually allows that to
[1:07:54] happen that he can fully Express himself
[1:07:57] in a way that could never before a fall
[1:08:01] so now we can worship God in far greater
[1:08:03] Revelation then Adam and Eve could
[1:08:05] before the fall that may be a strong
[1:08:07] statement but you think about it before
[1:08:08] the fall they could never worship him
[1:08:10] that that they've been healed they never
[1:08:12] needed healing oh they never they could
[1:08:14] never worship him a savior or guide or
[1:08:16] Redeemer or lamb or sacrifice or any of
[1:08:19] those things because they never needed
[1:08:21] it right but now we can stand here and
[1:08:24] and worship God you say but they they
[1:08:27] never had sorrow they never had sickness
[1:08:29] they never had trouble surely their
[1:08:31] worship would have been a lot easier do
[1:08:32] you know God has made us to worship
[1:08:35] we can worship God in spite of trouble
[1:08:39] in spite of sickness sorrow pain
[1:08:41] hardship trouble we can worship God and
[1:08:44] be Anointed with the spirit of God and
[1:08:46] praise him even with these things around
[1:08:48] because remember we are not Overcomers
[1:08:51] because God takes away trouble what we
[1:08:54] overcome even in the presence of trouble
[1:08:56] right because to take away a Temptation
[1:08:58] doesn't mean you overcome it it just
[1:09:00] means the temptation's gone right but
[1:09:02] but an overcomer can actually stand in
[1:09:04] the face of Temptation and not give
[1:09:05] themselves to it that's real overcoming
[1:09:07] and we are living in the age of the
[1:09:10] Overcomer right why because the Lord of
[1:09:12] hosts has revealed himself in this day
[1:09:14] that all of Heaven all that he is is now
[1:09:16] behind you and I Hallelujah so now they
[1:09:20] could worship God but then we can
[1:09:21] worship God and if I agree to measure
[1:09:23] than they ever could
[1:09:25] that's just me you might think that's a
[1:09:27] bit strong but you know I was lost now
[1:09:30] I'm found
[1:09:31] they could never they could worship as
[1:09:32] Creator as father I can do that too
[1:09:35] he's my father when when you receive the
[1:09:37] Holy Ghost you realize who your real
[1:09:39] father is so so and I know he created me
[1:09:42] so so I can worship Him in those ways
[1:09:44] but then that's when their worship stops
[1:09:46] and mind continues on Amen because I was
[1:09:48] lost on found I was blind now I see I
[1:09:51] was dead and sins but now I'm alive in
[1:09:52] Christ you know I've been sick but I've
[1:09:54] been healed you know I've been in
[1:09:56] trouble but now I've got peace you know
[1:09:58] so I can worship Him far more than they
[1:10:00] ever could but hey I tell you what when
[1:10:02] we get on the other side our worship
[1:10:04] will all join together and it's amazing
[1:10:06] because you think about it really you
[1:10:08] know you know on this side of Calvary
[1:10:11] and even on this side of things when the
[1:10:13] end of all things has happened the words
[1:10:14] come open the Lamb's taking the book and
[1:10:16] loose the seals you know we worship God
[1:10:19] you know in a way that we're just
[1:10:20] rejoicing in the promises we have
[1:10:22] received even even the change of the
[1:10:24] body we are in a resurrection cycle
[1:10:27] right now we're living in a Rapture
[1:10:28] cycle amen because he's transformed our
[1:10:31] souls from Death to life so our souls
[1:10:34] you could say are in a raptured
[1:10:35] condition now our bodies just got to
[1:10:37] catch up they'll get there but they've
[1:10:39] just got to catch up I'm into what's
[1:10:41] already happened within us right but so
[1:10:43] now if you go back to Genesis they were
[1:10:45] looking for all these promises to be
[1:10:47] fulfilled
[1:10:48] they were standing there saying one day
[1:10:51] it'll happen and that's why in Genesis 5
[1:10:53] you know no doubt when um you know it
[1:10:56] speaks about Adam's
[1:10:58] um you know Adam's line it says and then
[1:11:00] man began to call upon the name of the
[1:11:02] Lord so so they why would they call upon
[1:11:05] God because they they had a longing
[1:11:08] based on their parents testimonies of
[1:11:11] what was going to happen because no
[1:11:12] doubt they would have sat there now we
[1:11:14] know the first bubbles Written in the
[1:11:15] Stars we don't read that Bible because
[1:11:17] this is our Bible right but it's all in
[1:11:19] the Stars right and so no doubt they
[1:11:22] would they would sit there under the you
[1:11:24] know around the campfire at night or
[1:11:26] maybe not even with one no no light
[1:11:28] pollution
[1:11:29] who's ever been to a place like that
[1:11:31] there's no light Blues you're going to
[1:11:32] see the Milky Way in all of its Glory I
[1:11:34] remember being in Vanuatu once one of
[1:11:35] the northern islands and there's just no
[1:11:37] like they've got generators but they
[1:11:39] barely work there's no real lights there
[1:11:40] just a village and it's just a whole sky
[1:11:43] is just lit up
[1:11:44] and I just wanted to stand there like
[1:11:46] this the whole time I've never seen the
[1:11:48] Milky Way in all of its Glory like that
[1:11:50] but they were just you know but the
[1:11:52] locals well they live under it all the
[1:11:53] time so they weren't they weren't so
[1:11:55] transfixed like that but the reason they
[1:11:57] got used to it and they used to living
[1:11:58] in that kind of condition is because
[1:12:00] they had no man-made lights really to
[1:12:01] blot it out but then when when all the
[1:12:04] man-made lights are going out then we
[1:12:05] can really see what's above us and I
[1:12:08] trust it's the same thing you know
[1:12:09] there's a lot of man-made lights in this
[1:12:10] day of reasoning of politics of you know
[1:12:14] of religion you know of of ideas and
[1:12:17] culture I trust all those man-made
[1:12:19] lights go out that we can see the host
[1:12:21] above us we can see God is there and not
[1:12:24] just above us but with us and in US amen
[1:12:28] so so you know no doubt they would sit
[1:12:30] around the campfire even just look at
[1:12:32] the stars at night and then Adam would
[1:12:33] begin to begin to read the scriptures
[1:12:36] and they would tell the promise of of
[1:12:39] you know because they try and no doubt
[1:12:40] try and relate to their children what it
[1:12:42] was like to live in the garden no
[1:12:44] sickness sorrow death pain nothing it
[1:12:46] was perfection
[1:12:47] and then they would always come down no
[1:12:49] doubt to the to the story where it says
[1:12:51] yo God promised the seed of the woman's
[1:12:53] going to come and bruised the head of
[1:12:54] the seed of the serpents in other words
[1:12:56] God is going to become a man and undo
[1:12:58] what happened there so I believe that
[1:13:01] would have put a real longing in the in
[1:13:03] in their descendant's hearts that's why
[1:13:05] they call upon the name of the Lord in
[1:13:06] other words Lord when are you going to
[1:13:07] fulfill your promises when is this seed
[1:13:10] of the woman going to come they were
[1:13:12] under expectations sure they had the
[1:13:13] blood of the lamb but they were looking
[1:13:15] for thee lamb to come they had a longing
[1:13:18] now it's hard to relate to that because
[1:13:21] we're on the other side
[1:13:22] right we're not looking for him to come
[1:13:24] and take our sins away he already has
[1:13:26] right and he's already given us the Holy
[1:13:28] Ghost and he's opened his word to us
[1:13:30] we're standing on the other side of the
[1:13:32] promise rejoicing that it's all done now
[1:13:35] we're beneficiaries of of of all that
[1:13:37] prophecy being fulfilled now we're
[1:13:38] living in it but they are on the other
[1:13:40] side where it was all prophecy
[1:13:43] Hallelujah so we can stand here and
[1:13:45] praise God because they're looking
[1:13:47] they're hey no doubt they are excited
[1:13:48] they were emotional they would have been
[1:13:50] a hunger Lord when's this going to
[1:13:52] happen but it wasn't for them
[1:13:54] right it was for you and I in this day
[1:13:58] so we can praise God I think in a real
[1:14:00] special way
[1:14:01] amen hallelujah we have a lot to praise
[1:14:03] God about you can just go through the
[1:14:05] scripture look all of his promises he's
[1:14:06] fulfilled and then all the promises he's
[1:14:08] fulfilled in your life
[1:14:10] they should link together anyway you
[1:14:12] just have I don't know how much time you
[1:14:13] need to clear your schedule for quite a
[1:14:15] while all the praise breaks you'd have
[1:14:17] about how good he is amen
[1:14:20] praise the Lord
[1:14:22] so now God would reveal himself down
[1:14:25] through the Old Testament he would he
[1:14:26] would speak here in Genesis 12 and 1 to
[1:14:29] Abraham now we're going to jump around a
[1:14:30] bit here but but God would reveal
[1:14:33] himself to Abraham it says now the Lord
[1:14:34] said unto Abraham get the out of thy
[1:14:36] country and from thy Kindred and from my
[1:14:38] father's house into a land that I'll
[1:14:40] show thee now this word Capital Lord is
[1:14:42] is Jehovah and then he would come in
[1:14:45] Genesis 17 and 1. he says I am the
[1:14:48] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[1:14:50] perfect now God's done things in his
[1:14:53] life since then but you know it's not a
[1:14:55] different God I just want to emphasize
[1:14:56] this you know it's not a different God
[1:14:58] it wasn't then Jehovah spoke to Abraham
[1:15:00] and told him to leave his country go to
[1:15:02] another land and then the almighty God
[1:15:03] comes along that's exactly the same God
[1:15:06] now this word almighty god
[1:15:09] um it means it means it means El Shaddai
[1:15:12] now now the root word of Shaddai means
[1:15:15] means means the breasted one like a like
[1:15:17] a mother that breastfeeds her baby so
[1:15:20] here is Abraham he's well up in years he
[1:15:22] cannot fulfill the promise of Isaac
[1:15:24] coming him and Sarah cannot but he's
[1:15:26] been given the promise of the promised
[1:15:28] son and then so now God is revealing
[1:15:30] himself to Abraham as as as El Shaddai
[1:15:34] and what he's basically saying is he
[1:15:37] said Abraham I am the life-giver I'm the
[1:15:39] strength Giver
[1:15:40] just like a mother would nurse her
[1:15:42] newborn and and and all the strength and
[1:15:44] all the sustenance and all the nutrients
[1:15:47] from her would go into the baby
[1:15:50] just that way you feed off my promise
[1:15:53] you nurse off me and you'll get strength
[1:15:55] to fulfill the promise that I've given
[1:15:57] you and he is still El Shaddai this
[1:16:00] morning well we can take the promises of
[1:16:02] God that he's given to us and we can
[1:16:04] nurse strength from those promises
[1:16:05] remember God doesn't wave a promise in
[1:16:08] front of you to discourage you he
[1:16:10] doesn't wave a promise in front of you
[1:16:11] to dishearten you and discourage you no
[1:16:13] he waves a promise in front of you
[1:16:15] saying this is yours to increase your
[1:16:17] faith because he says now this is your
[1:16:20] promise nurse off it and you'll get
[1:16:22] strength and it will be fulfilled why
[1:16:24] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:16:25] hearing by the word of God so so so as
[1:16:28] we nurse off the promise Faith builds
[1:16:31] unbelief never builds Faith bills
[1:16:33] unbelief has to go away as we nurse off
[1:16:35] the promise mind battles have to leave
[1:16:37] double-mindedness have to believe has to
[1:16:39] leave as we feed off the promise of God
[1:16:41] because if you think about it we are we
[1:16:44] are you know we are a certain volume
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:47] or mass or whatever you want to call it
[1:16:48] just like this bottle now now if there
[1:16:51] was oil and water in here you could say
[1:16:53] that the what floats the oil floats
[1:16:54] right so you could say the oil is is
[1:16:57] unbelief
[1:16:59] if this was full if there's full of so
[1:17:01] just say this is your mind we're born
[1:17:04] it's full of unbelief it's full of oil
[1:17:06] okay but then we begin to get the
[1:17:09] promises of God and New Birth happens
[1:17:10] right we get the promises of God and now
[1:17:13] our mind only contains a certain much
[1:17:15] our conscious thinking yeah but now in
[1:17:18] order to replace our current thinking we
[1:17:21] need something else to come and to
[1:17:22] replace it with right so now if your
[1:17:25] mind is doubting and troubled and you
[1:17:27] know everyone's wrong and this is a
[1:17:28] problem whatever more you just need your
[1:17:30] thinking to be changed but because
[1:17:32] remember With God all things are
[1:17:35] possible and then Jesus said it all
[1:17:37] things are possible to them that believe
[1:17:39] so there's nothing is impossible with
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:42] that's what he's saying because all
[1:17:44] things are possible within belief now
[1:17:45] how do we but but then how do we come to
[1:17:47] a place that faith can take a hold well
[1:17:50] brother Brown taught us that first the
[1:17:52] word's got to come into the mind
[1:17:53] and then it's accepted in the mind that
[1:17:55] it comes down to the soul and then Faith
[1:17:57] takes
[1:17:58] takes us you know your manifestation so
[1:18:01] if our mind is filled of unbelief and
[1:18:03] doubting and trouble because the devil
[1:18:04] wants us he wants to preoccupy our
[1:18:06] thinking he wants us to look at
[1:18:07] everything else but nurse off the
[1:18:09] promise because he knows if we come in
[1:18:11] contact with a promise a nurse of it
[1:18:12] we'll get strengthened hey he's on his
[1:18:14] way amen he's defeated he's under our
[1:18:16] feet so now in order to change our
[1:18:18] thinking all we need to do is replace
[1:18:20] negative thinking with good thinking
[1:18:21] well then how do we do that well you
[1:18:24] take the promises of God and you begin
[1:18:26] to feed on them and then eventually all
[1:18:29] of the oil will become water
[1:18:31] your mind will be full of Faith right
[1:18:33] full of promises you have a positive
[1:18:34] outlook positive thinking and this is
[1:18:36] not the power of positive thinking but
[1:18:38] I'm going to show you that really all of
[1:18:39] Heaven is there at our disposal but it
[1:18:42] takes you to dispense it
[1:18:44] and we'll get to that later
[1:18:46] amen that's why it's very important that
[1:18:47] we don't just you know don't just sit in
[1:18:50] doubt but we but we nurse off the
[1:18:52] promise God is more than able
[1:18:55] amen just it now he comes as almighty
[1:18:58] God here in Genesis 17. now if we go
[1:19:01] forward to the Book of Exodus
[1:19:03] it says next to the six and one and the
[1:19:05] Lord said unto Moses this is this is
[1:19:07] Jehovah this is the same one that spoke
[1:19:09] to Abraham in Genesis 12 and 1. she said
[1:19:12] it says then the Lord said unto Moses
[1:19:13] then now shall see what I'll do to
[1:19:15] Pharaoh for with a strong hand will he
[1:19:18] let them go and with a strong uh um hand
[1:19:20] shall he drive them out of his land and
[1:19:22] the Lord spake unto Moses saying I am
[1:19:24] the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham
[1:19:26] unto Isaac unto Jacob by the name of God
[1:19:28] Almighty but by the name of Jehovah was
[1:19:31] I not known to them now hold on but we
[1:19:34] just read that you know the Lord or
[1:19:36] Jehovah made himself known so what does
[1:19:38] he mean by that well what he means is
[1:19:40] that they had never needed a deliverer
[1:19:42] before
[1:19:43] Abraham Isaac and Jacob were never
[1:19:45] slaves they were never in bondage they
[1:19:47] were never under the oppression of a
[1:19:49] foreign government you know they weren't
[1:19:51] slaves so God is going to come as
[1:19:53] Jehovah in a different way as in
[1:19:55] deliverer they never needed delivering
[1:19:57] before
[1:19:58] right but the Israelites here in Exodus
[1:20:01] they're under hard bondage they're
[1:20:02] crying out to God because now comes a
[1:20:04] time of promise but then also so now
[1:20:07] God's saying they don't they didn't know
[1:20:09] me by this name so I'm going to reveal
[1:20:10] part of my character that I couldn't
[1:20:12] reveal to them because they didn't need
[1:20:13] it
[1:20:14] amen said God's going to come as a
[1:20:16] delivery and we know that you know he
[1:20:18] would he would come and deliver and he
[1:20:20] would take them out of Egypt and take
[1:20:21] them into the promised land now what I
[1:20:23] love about this is that he says and I've
[1:20:25] also established my Covenant with them
[1:20:27] to give them the land of Cain and the
[1:20:29] land of their pilgrimage when they were
[1:20:30] strangers and I have also heard the
[1:20:32] groanings of the children of Israel whom
[1:20:34] the Egyptians keep in bondage and I've
[1:20:35] remembered my Covenant wherefore say
[1:20:38] unto the children of Israel I am the
[1:20:39] Lord
[1:20:40] and I'll bring you out from under the
[1:20:41] burdens of the Egyptians and I'll rid
[1:20:43] you out of their bondage and I'll redeem
[1:20:45] you with an outstretched arm with great
[1:20:47] judgments and I'll take take you to me
[1:20:50] for a people and I will and I will beat
[1:20:52] you a God and you shall know that I am
[1:20:54] the Lord your God which bringeth you out
[1:20:56] from under the burdens of Egypt and I'll
[1:20:58] bring you unto the land concerning which
[1:20:59] I'd swear it to give it to Abraham to
[1:21:02] Isaac to Jacob and I will give you and
[1:21:03] uh give give it you for a Heritage I am
[1:21:07] the Lord now so what he's saying is I'm
[1:21:09] going to return you back to the land of
[1:21:12] your fathers now we live in a time when
[1:21:14] we have returned back to our homeland
[1:21:15] right our homeland is the word of God
[1:21:18] right the anointed word of God where our
[1:21:21] where the apostolic fathers were in that
[1:21:23] land but then down through the Dark Ages
[1:21:25] and a Reformation you know down to the
[1:21:27] Dark Ages they left out land for Creeds
[1:21:29] and dogmas they went under slavery but
[1:21:31] then under Lutheran different ones that
[1:21:33] now came a Reformation
[1:21:34] I mean and then now we live in a time of
[1:21:37] restoration we've been where we have
[1:21:38] been restored back to the original faith
[1:21:40] of the fathers so when it says that now
[1:21:42] now I'm going to show myself as
[1:21:43] deliverer here God God is also showing
[1:21:46] us that he's going to deliver us out of
[1:21:48] this yoke of bondage of of religion and
[1:21:50] unbelief and culture and things I'm
[1:21:52] going to take you back to your true
[1:21:53] Homeland which is the word of God Amen
[1:21:56] but he they did not know him by the name
[1:21:58] of Jehovah Abraham Isaac and Jacob but
[1:22:00] he's going to reveal himself in this way
[1:22:01] now just stick with me okay because soon
[1:22:03] lunch will happen
[1:22:04] right it'll be there all right so so
[1:22:09] we'll get there okay I'll get to a
[1:22:10] certain spot and I'll quit and then
[1:22:12] we'll sing and then we'll go home now
[1:22:14] we're going to realize that in Isaiah 43
[1:22:16] it says I even I am the Lord besides me
[1:22:19] there's no savior so there's no
[1:22:21] different God remember it wasn't a
[1:22:22] multiple different number of gods that
[1:22:24] met Abraham it was the same God
[1:22:25] revealing himself right it was a
[1:22:28] continuous revelation of the same God to
[1:22:30] Abraham that's the same thing with you
[1:22:32] and I you know God doesn't reveal all of
[1:22:35] his character to us in one go
[1:22:37] right he reveals himself as we walk with
[1:22:40] him
[1:22:41] amen you know maybe we just done first
[1:22:44] of course as a savior right but then we
[1:22:46] see that he's redeemed us and then he
[1:22:48] heals us then he leads us and guide us
[1:22:50] counsels us you know is Our Shepherd
[1:22:52] different attributes that he shows us as
[1:22:54] we walk with him along the way so now he
[1:22:56] would say in Isaiah 43 and 11 I even I
[1:22:58] am the Lord besides me there's no savior
[1:23:00] there's no savior besides the Lord now
[1:23:02] that Lord means Jehovah right and he and
[1:23:05] he says in Isaiah 55 and 5 I am the lord
[1:23:07] and there is none else there is no God
[1:23:09] beside me I go to thee though thou Hast
[1:23:12] not known me that and he says that they
[1:23:16] may know from the rising of the Sun and
[1:23:17] from the West that is numb beside me I
[1:23:19] am the lord and there is none else so
[1:23:21] he's declaring very openly there's no
[1:23:22] other God it's only me I'm the only one
[1:23:25] right here there's no other God beside
[1:23:27] me so he's the only savior he's the only
[1:23:29] God
[1:23:31] now Isaiah would say earlier now now we
[1:23:33] now I'm going to make a transition now
[1:23:35] because all of these names of God that
[1:23:37] we could go through the you know the you
[1:23:39] know the you know the different
[1:23:40] Redemptive names of Jehovah
[1:23:42] and all the names of God they're all
[1:23:44] wrapped up in Jesus Christ the name
[1:23:46] Jesus Christ so now he would you know
[1:23:49] you know Isaiah would prophesy therefore
[1:23:51] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:23:52] behold the Virgin shall conceive and
[1:23:54] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:23:55] Emmanuel
[1:23:57] and it's an Isaiah 9 and 6 run to us a
[1:23:59] child is born unto us the son is given
[1:24:01] and the government shall be upon his
[1:24:03] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:24:05] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:24:07] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:24:10] now if we jump forward here into Matthew
[1:24:13] um you know the angel comes the angel
[1:24:15] Gabriel or the angel of the Lord
[1:24:16] actually appears to Joseph now I'm just
[1:24:18] taking this bit because earlier we have
[1:24:20] Gabriel will come to Mary and tell she's
[1:24:23] going to have the promised son and then
[1:24:24] the angel Lord appears to Joseph because
[1:24:26] Joseph is minded to put his wife you
[1:24:28] know put put Mary away privately
[1:24:30] different things but then you know so
[1:24:31] he's pondering these things so he
[1:24:33] doesn't understand how Mary could be
[1:24:34] with child because she's a righteous
[1:24:36] woman you know but then but then she's
[1:24:39] with childhood how could this be and she
[1:24:40] said an angel's visited me and it just
[1:24:42] doesn't make sense to him but then but
[1:24:44] then God the angel of the Lord appears
[1:24:46] to him in a dream
[1:24:47] and he says do not you know fear to take
[1:24:49] under the Mary thy wife for that which
[1:24:51] is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] and she shall bring forth the son and
[1:24:55] thou shall call his name Jesus for he
[1:24:58] shall save his people from their sins
[1:24:59] now now if we think about this but hold
[1:25:01] on
[1:25:02] but I thought his name would be Emmanuel
[1:25:04] I thought his name would be wonderful
[1:25:06] counsel of the Mighty God the
[1:25:07] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:25:09] So what's going on here is this Angel
[1:25:11] wrong no this Angel is right because all
[1:25:14] of those descriptions of God what he
[1:25:16] would be is is encapsulated in the name
[1:25:19] Jesus
[1:25:20] maybe because even Jesus means Jehovah's
[1:25:23] salvation so now as he was a deliverer
[1:25:26] there in Exodus 6. of of Israel out of
[1:25:30] Egypt and taking them to the promised
[1:25:31] land he's going to bring a far greater
[1:25:33] order of Deliverance because that was
[1:25:35] just a physical Deliverance where they
[1:25:37] were slaves physically and then they
[1:25:39] went to a Promised Land but the thing is
[1:25:40] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[1:25:41] could never be delivered from the
[1:25:43] slavery of unbelief
[1:25:44] so because their hearts could never be
[1:25:47] changed because the life of the blood of
[1:25:48] bulls and goats could never come unto
[1:25:50] them and change their nature I mean
[1:25:52] that's why that's why David with all of
[1:25:54] us learned behavior where he'd say I
[1:25:55] have not you know I always said the Lord
[1:25:57] before my face I said not against them
[1:25:59] and you know different things he'd say
[1:26:01] when he saw Bathsheba all of that
[1:26:03] learned behavior of Walking with God
[1:26:04] went to one side because his nature
[1:26:06] wasn't changed right even though he was
[1:26:09] he was a man after God's Own Heart he
[1:26:11] sincerely served the Lord but because it
[1:26:13] was just learned behavior there was no
[1:26:14] blood in that day to change his nature
[1:26:16] as soon as Sin presented itself he
[1:26:19] jumped into it
[1:26:20] but unto the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:26:23] can change he changes our nature he
[1:26:25] makes us a new creation he doesn't just
[1:26:26] patch us up he makes a new creature
[1:26:29] praise the Lord I'm glad about that I
[1:26:31] trust you are happy about that too amen
[1:26:33] that sin nature no longer governs our
[1:26:35] lives but we've been liberated from the
[1:26:37] slavery of unbelief from sin amen he's
[1:26:40] changed our nature to give us a nature
[1:26:42] of faith praise the Lord that's the only
[1:26:44] way you can walk with God is is because
[1:26:46] you know Paul would say in Galatians
[1:26:48] that it's not circumcision or
[1:26:49] uncircumcision but it's but a new
[1:26:51] creature avails that's the thing that
[1:26:54] has power right so so that's the most
[1:26:56] important thing
[1:26:57] now so you call his name Jesus he shall
[1:27:00] save his people from their sins now
[1:27:02] we've got to realize that this is
[1:27:03] exactly what the Lord did
[1:27:05] so so here was the highest name that God
[1:27:07] would ever give himself is in Jesus
[1:27:09] Christ right Jehovah's not as high as
[1:27:12] that almighty God El Shaddai all those
[1:27:15] names are encapsulated in the name of
[1:27:17] Jesus Christ this is the highest
[1:27:19] revelation of the name of God given to
[1:27:21] man why because it would show in the
[1:27:23] Manifest age because with the name is a
[1:27:25] manifestation of power right just like
[1:27:27] he was Jehovah to deliver Israel what
[1:27:30] they were Redeemed by Blood and by Power
[1:27:32] by the blood of the lamb and The Exodus
[1:27:34] but was the power of God that delivered
[1:27:36] them and so every time God's name is
[1:27:39] there who's with me today okay I trust
[1:27:41] you're with me no so because there's
[1:27:43] power in that name we're going to
[1:27:44] realize who we talk to where to realize
[1:27:46] who we pray to you know don't take it
[1:27:47] for granted while I'm talking to God
[1:27:49] well who's this God he's not just a
[1:27:51] force like some ether wave somewhere
[1:27:52] he's a person he's a being and he made
[1:27:54] all things and so he began to manifest
[1:27:57] his name praise the Lord why because he
[1:28:00] was called by that name and you live
[1:28:02] whatever your name is naturally you'll
[1:28:04] have a character based on that name
[1:28:05] it'll influence your character amen so
[1:28:07] he went about the first thing he did he
[1:28:09] began to cast out Devils heal the sick
[1:28:11] raise the dead gather his people to
[1:28:13] himself why that he would after the
[1:28:16] after he shed his blood upon the cross
[1:28:18] and Rise Rose triumphant on the third
[1:28:19] day would pour His Spirit out of upon
[1:28:22] the
[1:28:22] um Church there Amen on the day of
[1:28:24] Pentecost
[1:28:26] because this was the Fulfillment where
[1:28:29] where'd say now all this was done that
[1:28:31] it might be fulfilled we just spoken of
[1:28:33] the Lord by the prophet saying behold
[1:28:34] the Virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:28:36] bring forth the son they shall call his
[1:28:38] name Emmanuel which is being interpreted
[1:28:39] as God With Us now we've got to look at
[1:28:42] the effect of this name when this name
[1:28:45] was ever spoken the first time this name
[1:28:47] was ever spoken through human lips what
[1:28:49] it did
[1:28:50] now the first time this name was ever
[1:28:51] spoken was after Mary Mary would would
[1:28:54] after she had this visitation she began
[1:28:57] to find herself with child she was told
[1:28:59] by the angel that that her cousin
[1:29:01] Elizabeth was with child as well
[1:29:03] now Elizabeth's child had never moved in
[1:29:06] the womb at this stage she was she was
[1:29:08] six months pregnant normally by that
[1:29:10] stage you you feel a lot of kicks even
[1:29:12] even husbands can feel a lot of kicks
[1:29:14] through the through the womb you know
[1:29:16] sometimes like just just give him some
[1:29:17] you know
[1:29:19] and you get a bit of a kick there you
[1:29:21] know but but by six months you should be
[1:29:23] feeling those things but Elizabeth never
[1:29:25] felt the baby move and to no doubt she
[1:29:28] was troubled by these things and then
[1:29:29] Mary comes her cousin comes running you
[1:29:32] know and and and visits her and she
[1:29:35] would make her salutation because no
[1:29:37] doubt they would greet each other and
[1:29:38] hug each other and you know Elizabeth
[1:29:39] was with child she knew she was
[1:29:42] expecting but then when she saw Mary
[1:29:43] she'd say Mary what happened to you I
[1:29:46] thought have you been married when was
[1:29:48] the wedding why did I get an invitation
[1:29:50] you know those kind of things but you
[1:29:52] know she'd say no no we're not
[1:29:54] um married yet and but so so she so
[1:29:57] Elizabeth was like oh well what's
[1:29:58] happened here what's going on and then
[1:30:00] and then Mary was like no no nothing
[1:30:02] like that happened I was I was going to
[1:30:04] get water from the well one day and it
[1:30:06] was like any other kind of a day but
[1:30:08] there was a man standing there in the
[1:30:09] way there was a different kind of
[1:30:10] atmosphere around him and he called me
[1:30:13] by name I don't know how he knew my name
[1:30:14] but he knew my name he said hell Mary
[1:30:16] and you know she's like what is going on
[1:30:19] here and then he would begin to quote
[1:30:21] promises that we had read earlier from
[1:30:23] the Scrolls of Isaiah those ones I heard
[1:30:25] in the synagogue that just spoke to my
[1:30:27] heart and now the angel has come to
[1:30:28] confirm his word and then he would say
[1:30:30] that I'm going to have the Messiah
[1:30:32] and and and and and and she you know I
[1:30:35] was puzzled by this I said well how can
[1:30:37] this be uh you know we're not married
[1:30:38] you know I'm not married to Joseph I
[1:30:39] don't know a man and you know but he'd
[1:30:41] say no the Holy Ghost is going to come
[1:30:43] and create the Messiah in your womb and
[1:30:46] you shall call his name Jesus and the
[1:30:48] first time that name was ever spoken
[1:30:50] through mortal lips amen the Holy Ghost
[1:30:52] fell upon Elizabeth and John began to
[1:30:54] jump for joy in the womb of his mother
[1:30:56] amen so now if the if the first time
[1:30:59] that name is spoke you think about how
[1:31:00] powerful this name is the first time
[1:31:03] this name was ever spoken a dead baby in
[1:31:05] a womb came to life and and also the
[1:31:08] Holy Ghost fell upon Elizabeth and she
[1:31:10] began to prophesy and praise God that
[1:31:13] was the first time that name was ever
[1:31:14] spoken through mortal lips upon the
[1:31:16] earth now
[1:31:18] if that was for a if that could do that
[1:31:20] to a dead baby in a mother's womb how
[1:31:23] much more a holy ghost-filled church
[1:31:25] ought to make it leap and jump for joy
[1:31:27] if we realize the power of that name
[1:31:30] what that name has done for you and I
[1:31:33] amen it hasn't just made us religious
[1:31:35] people it hasn't just given us a
[1:31:37] different kind of a church and while we
[1:31:38] believe this and our founder to listen
[1:31:40] no it doesn't hasn't given us that it's
[1:31:43] given us deliverance from sin amen
[1:31:45] deliverance from unbelief deliverance
[1:31:48] from you know from all temptation all
[1:31:50] trouble amen it's given us healing for
[1:31:53] our bodies healing for our minds amen
[1:31:55] it's redeemed us back to God
[1:31:57] Hallelujah add more to make us jump for
[1:32:00] joy that sacred precious name of the
[1:32:02] Lord Jesus Christ amen that name is
[1:32:06] above all names
[1:32:07] Hallelujah no Jesus would give
[1:32:10] instructions because remember in that
[1:32:12] name is resurrection I mean that's why
[1:32:14] he could because remember he says I come
[1:32:16] in my father's name and you receive me
[1:32:18] not well what is the name of the father
[1:32:20] then Jesus
[1:32:21] but why because that's the highest name
[1:32:23] that God has given
[1:32:25] Hallelujah right of himself why because
[1:32:27] he's declaring all of his attributes in
[1:32:30] that name amen under the name of Jehovah
[1:32:32] there was no deliverance from sin
[1:32:34] there's just a blood covering to cover
[1:32:36] their sins by the blood of bulls and
[1:32:38] ghosts but they could not change their
[1:32:39] nature but under the name of Jesus
[1:32:41] Christ amen we can become New Creations
[1:32:43] you think about David David was an
[1:32:46] unusual believer really he would sit
[1:32:49] there and he would write Psalms as the
[1:32:51] heart paneth for the water Brooks oh my
[1:32:52] soul Longs after thee he says one thing
[1:32:54] I've decided I want to dwell in the
[1:32:56] house of the Lord forever he was king of
[1:32:58] Israel different things but he just had
[1:32:59] a longing Lord I want to be in your
[1:33:01] presence I want to walk into your courts
[1:33:02] I want to be where you are then you
[1:33:04] think about he had a longing
[1:33:06] that God would dwell in him basically
[1:33:08] but God could anoint him the spirit of
[1:33:10] God was with him but wasn't in him
[1:33:12] so he had a desire that he could never
[1:33:14] actually fulfill on that side of Calvary
[1:33:18] though remember all the saints of the
[1:33:20] Old Testament there they'll be in glory
[1:33:22] too right that's why those who died
[1:33:25] under the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:33:26] Faith they went to Paradise they were
[1:33:28] waiting right but their deed had to be
[1:33:31] cleared right the blood of bulls and
[1:33:33] goats cover their sin but something a
[1:33:34] blood a greater blood had to come to do
[1:33:36] it away and that's why the scripture
[1:33:38] says that he led captivity captive right
[1:33:41] so when Jesus when Jesus's body was in
[1:33:44] the Tomb a lot of things were going on
[1:33:46] what Jesus went down and preached to the
[1:33:48] souls in prison saying you should have
[1:33:50] listened to Noah because here I am right
[1:33:52] and then he went down further and he you
[1:33:53] know kicked in the door of hell and
[1:33:55] Satan's on his Lazy Boy chair and he
[1:33:57] thinks now I've got you now I thought I
[1:33:59] had you when I had Abel I thought I had
[1:34:00] you when I had no I thought I had you
[1:34:02] when I had a you know you know all the
[1:34:03] Believers down Through the Ages but now
[1:34:05] I know I've got you I thought I had you
[1:34:06] when I had John the Baptist surely I did
[1:34:08] but now I've got you but then actually
[1:34:10] Satan wasn't the one who got anyone God
[1:34:12] got him
[1:34:13] right because his blood was on the cross
[1:34:15] he had purchased the salvation of Adam's
[1:34:18] Fallen race for the sins of the world he
[1:34:19] he had died he says no Satan I'm in
[1:34:22] charge here now you ain't boss no give
[1:34:24] me the keys to hell death in the grave
[1:34:25] you act some other side boots him back
[1:34:27] down and then he ascends on high it's
[1:34:29] amazing you know we can be walking along
[1:34:31] in in utter despair
[1:34:34] and utter broken
[1:34:36] Ness
[1:34:38] because the disciples their whole life
[1:34:40] had fallen apart
[1:34:41] and now living in a season of
[1:34:43] Resurrection
[1:34:45] the Messiah had been crucified the
[1:34:47] ministry had shut themselves up in an
[1:34:49] upper room
[1:34:50] the one who's who Jesus said will be
[1:34:52] given the keys to the kingdom swore and
[1:34:54] denied the Lord so in his great trial he
[1:34:56] actually denied God did those things the
[1:34:59] the church treasurer had committed
[1:35:00] suicide the whole movement of falling
[1:35:02] apart
[1:35:04] but in an Unseen World
[1:35:06] God was giving the greatest Victory he'd
[1:35:08] ever gone I mean taking the keys he held
[1:35:10] it in the grave of Satan then he
[1:35:12] ascended up into paradise and all the
[1:35:14] Believers that are under the blood of
[1:35:15] bulls and goats they were under
[1:35:16] expectation for him to come and know
[1:35:18] that that you know they just spent all
[1:35:20] that time giving testimonies to when
[1:35:22] they saw him in their day Hallelujah
[1:35:24] then the door came open then he stepped
[1:35:26] in Hallelujah and then he empty Paradise
[1:35:29] why because the blood had been given to
[1:35:31] clear their clear their deed that they
[1:35:33] could Ascend up into Glory right amen so
[1:35:36] now so a lot of things can be happening
[1:35:38] up you know in the world and we just
[1:35:40] think life has just gone sideways and
[1:35:42] everything's bad
[1:35:43] because the disciples thought everything
[1:35:45] had gone bad but the greatest event in
[1:35:47] history they were living in and they
[1:35:49] didn't realize it that's why when Jesus
[1:35:50] appeared to clopidus and his friend on
[1:35:53] the road to Damascus you know he he was
[1:35:55] actually asking why are you sad
[1:35:58] why are you downcast why aren't you
[1:36:00] happy and here he was the resurrected
[1:36:02] triumphant Messiah was walking with them
[1:36:04] but but their eyes weren't open that
[1:36:07] they would know who he was and then so
[1:36:09] they were walking along and and and and
[1:36:11] and and and he asked that question why
[1:36:13] are you sad and they're and they're
[1:36:14] surprised what do you mean don't you
[1:36:16] know what just happened
[1:36:17] weren't you there the crucifixion do you
[1:36:19] not hear what just happened to Jesus of
[1:36:20] Nazareth we believe he was a prophet we
[1:36:22] believe he is the Messiah he was going
[1:36:24] to restore Israel do all these things
[1:36:25] and then Jesus who was walking with him
[1:36:27] said o fools and slow of hardness to
[1:36:30] believe
[1:36:30] and they started at Moses and went
[1:36:33] through all the scriptures pertaining
[1:36:35] himself no doubt all the prophecies all
[1:36:37] the types and the shadows and then when
[1:36:40] they came to the Village Emmaus they
[1:36:42] constrained him because he because it
[1:36:44] looked like he was going to walk on he
[1:36:45] said hold on
[1:36:47] come and eat with us and then he sat
[1:36:49] down
[1:36:50] and then he break the bread now
[1:36:52] apparently in the Jewish tradition the
[1:36:54] head of the house breaks the bread
[1:36:55] so he even though even before they
[1:36:57] realized who he was they actually gave
[1:36:59] him the head of the house they gave the
[1:37:00] chief seat at the table and then he
[1:37:02] broke the bread and their eyes came open
[1:37:04] why because he did something that he did
[1:37:07] before he went to Calvary because he
[1:37:09] broke the bread of the Loaves and Fishes
[1:37:10] different things their eyes came open
[1:37:12] when they did it when they saw a
[1:37:13] manifestation of what he did before amen
[1:37:15] and then they realized that the Messiah
[1:37:17] had risen and they were once said now
[1:37:20] they go run back into Jerusalem happy to
[1:37:21] tell the disciples who have seen him
[1:37:23] he's alive and they said didn't our
[1:37:25] hearts burn within us as he spake along
[1:37:26] the way now it's the same thing with us
[1:37:28] we've had a Ministry in the end time
[1:37:30] where the thoughts and hearts of the
[1:37:32] people have been discerned down to
[1:37:34] addresses what's wrong Vision scene the
[1:37:36] same Ministry of Jesus Christ has
[1:37:37] repeated in this end time he did
[1:37:39] something before he was crucified he's
[1:37:42] done again in the end time to show you
[1:37:44] I'm alive
[1:37:45] my name has power amen I'm here to
[1:37:48] gather you to to myself because you're
[1:37:51] living in a Resurrection season remember
[1:37:53] the two on the way to Emmaus Jesus went
[1:37:55] with them until they saw not just the
[1:37:58] resurrection had happened but they were
[1:37:59] part of that Resurrection amen because
[1:38:01] they had to go to the upper room where
[1:38:03] before that they were dead and
[1:38:04] trespasses and sins but now they're
[1:38:06] Alive by the new birth
[1:38:07] Hallelujah so he needed them to realize
[1:38:10] they were part of the Fulfillment of the
[1:38:12] Resurrection hour it's the same thing
[1:38:14] with you and I the Lord walks with us
[1:38:15] until we realize and he keeps walking
[1:38:17] after it don't get me wrong but he walks
[1:38:19] with you opening his word until you
[1:38:20] realize not just he's alive but I'm part
[1:38:23] of the Fulfillment of his word in this
[1:38:25] end time
[1:38:26] Hallelujah
[1:38:28] praise the Lord now we're kind of
[1:38:30] jumping around here now
[1:38:32] so now if if if his the first time his
[1:38:35] name is spoken gave gave a a dead baby
[1:38:39] life in a mother's womb and she was
[1:38:41] filled with the Holy Ghost how much more
[1:38:43] it should do to a holy ghost-filled
[1:38:44] church amen sir so now they were
[1:38:47] instructed
[1:38:48] they were instructed now in Luke 24. he
[1:38:52] says and then and then he opened their
[1:38:54] under um either understanding that they
[1:38:56] might understand the scriptures and said
[1:38:58] unto them thus it is written and thus it
[1:39:01] behooved Christ to suffering to raise
[1:39:02] from the dead the third day and that
[1:39:04] repentance and remission of sin should
[1:39:06] be preached in his name among all
[1:39:07] nations being beginning at Jerusalem
[1:39:10] so it all had to be done in his name and
[1:39:13] it's amazing now now it's not just that
[1:39:15] that's done in his name baptism is in
[1:39:17] his name right that's why because
[1:39:19] amazing people will pray in his name
[1:39:21] they will they will they'll ask for
[1:39:23] healing in his name guidance in his name
[1:39:25] but they'll never be called by his name
[1:39:27] amen and how you call by his name is
[1:39:29] that you're buried in his name in
[1:39:31] baptism to come forth in newness of life
[1:39:33] amen because that name is the name above
[1:39:36] all names as it's saying Philippians 2
[1:39:38] that at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:39:41] should bow things in heaven thinks in
[1:39:42] Earth and things under the Earth
[1:39:44] now
[1:39:46] I'm just gonna I feel like I'm just
[1:39:47] gonna skip a whole bunch of this because
[1:39:48] I want to come down to now what has this
[1:39:50] got to do with us and now we've come to
[1:39:53] um Jehovah um sabath what has this got
[1:39:56] to do with all that heaven is that you
[1:39:58] know we can access
[1:40:00] it's very important we realize who who
[1:40:02] we can have access to
[1:40:04] yeah right just as Jacob could wrestle
[1:40:06] with God when he recognized the ain't
[1:40:09] host of angels who are around him right
[1:40:11] he could rest with God and be changed
[1:40:12] we're going to recognize that we can get
[1:40:15] a hold of God that life can come forth
[1:40:17] why did Hannah pour a life out at the
[1:40:19] Tabernacle that life would come that
[1:40:22] Deliverance would a deliverable would
[1:40:24] come and judges or a prophet would come
[1:40:26] and open the word restore things how it
[1:40:28] should be bring a kingly line in that's
[1:40:31] why I've got to realize the one we can
[1:40:32] come to can give us life right not just
[1:40:35] natural life of a baby which is all
[1:40:37] perfectly well but eternal life God's
[1:40:39] own life
[1:40:41] now he after he arose he became our high
[1:40:45] priest right Jesus Christ is our high
[1:40:47] priest he ever liveth to maketh
[1:40:49] intercession for us amen for you and I
[1:40:51] he is Intercity on your behalf right so
[1:40:54] he is now the high priest of as as as
[1:40:57] brother Brown will put it of his own
[1:40:59] word
[1:40:59] so he is there to intercede that his his
[1:41:02] own word would be fulfilled right now
[1:41:05] but the thing is his word can never be
[1:41:07] fulfilled in our lives until we confess
[1:41:09] that he has not only done it but he can
[1:41:11] do it right it's absolutely important
[1:41:14] that we do not confess unbelief but we
[1:41:16] confess the promises of God well because
[1:41:19] if you think about it when Jesus was on
[1:41:22] when when Jesus was talking to pilate he
[1:41:25] says I could call my Father in heaven
[1:41:27] and he could send 12 Legions of angels
[1:41:29] right so there were 12 Legions of angels
[1:41:32] now I didn't do the math but it's a lot
[1:41:34] of angels one could have done the whole
[1:41:35] job one could have annihilated all the
[1:41:37] Romans could have wiped out all the
[1:41:39] Sanhedrin could have leveled the whole
[1:41:40] place one could have done it but he
[1:41:42] could have called 12 Legions of angels
[1:41:44] but you see those angels were there at
[1:41:46] attention they were ready to move but
[1:41:49] Jesus had to give the command
[1:41:51] amen just like all that heaven is it's
[1:41:53] all at your attention
[1:41:55] just like the king would say to Esther
[1:41:57] what do you have need of I'll give you
[1:41:58] give you even a up to half the kingdom
[1:42:00] or make you call
[1:42:02] um co-ruler in other words you know so
[1:42:04] so so what do you have need of what is
[1:42:06] your request all of Heaven is there
[1:42:09] but you've got to call for it
[1:42:11] what is your need today
[1:42:13] amen because remember he's the high
[1:42:14] priest of our profession
[1:42:16] amen so so and and that word profession
[1:42:20] means a confession
[1:42:22] so he will his hands are Heaven is tied
[1:42:24] Heaven's hands are tied until you speak
[1:42:28] life and death is in the power of the
[1:42:30] tongue right
[1:42:32] eternal life isn't the power of the
[1:42:34] tongue
[1:42:35] amen right this thing's very powerful
[1:42:38] but you need to speak to God and and and
[1:42:41] quote his promises and take him at his
[1:42:43] word that heaven can come and be
[1:42:45] dispensed on your behalf
[1:42:48] amen that's why it's so important
[1:42:50] because those that call upon the name of
[1:42:52] the Lord shall be saved right but first
[1:42:54] you've got to call upon the name of the
[1:42:55] Lord what's the name Lord Jesus save me
[1:42:57] help me right so he's there as a savior
[1:42:59] be a call upon him and he saves you amen
[1:43:03] so he is he is all there you say well
[1:43:05] why do we bother with this whole service
[1:43:07] this morning I just I'm just going to
[1:43:08] wrap it up with this because I think
[1:43:09] some people are very underwhelmed but
[1:43:11] that's fine
[1:43:12] All That Heaven is is at your disposal
[1:43:15] God can do anything he wants but he's
[1:43:17] waiting for you he has partnered his his
[1:43:20] salvation plan with man he works through
[1:43:22] man he could have got the Sun the moon
[1:43:24] the stars the trees the birds the
[1:43:25] preacher's gospel but he's got you to be
[1:43:27] a living witness right so all of Heaven
[1:43:30] is behind the believer even before you
[1:43:32] became a Believer God was watching over
[1:43:34] you brooding over your life drawing you
[1:43:36] to himself that's why any religious
[1:43:38] experience you had before you came to
[1:43:40] the truth God used
[1:43:41] God was working in there right he was
[1:43:43] gathering you through it wasn't in vain
[1:43:45] he was doing something in your life
[1:43:46] right but you see now now because he's
[1:43:49] tied his plan to you
[1:43:50] you had to speak you have to go on
[1:43:53] prayer right because he's because he
[1:43:55] can't do anything until you call for it
[1:43:58] right and we are not just calling upon a
[1:44:01] god
[1:44:01] or just Jesus as in the world wants to
[1:44:04] make him just this little Aaron boy and
[1:44:06] he died on the cross and no he's more
[1:44:08] than that he is the Lord Of Glory you
[1:44:11] think that we can come into the presence
[1:44:13] of the almighty God
[1:44:15] amen his blood means we're coming to his
[1:44:17] Almighty presence the one who made all
[1:44:19] things who made every atom every
[1:44:21] molecule every piece of matter that man
[1:44:23] can identify he made it all
[1:44:26] right and we can come into His presence
[1:44:28] and talk to him like the Angels can't
[1:44:30] talk to him because we are his children
[1:44:34] amen I think it's immensely powerful
[1:44:37] he said well that's Elementary no we
[1:44:39] must never ever diminish the one we talk
[1:44:41] to
[1:44:42] amen because he's the all-powerful
[1:44:44] almighty Lord Jesus Christ who has come
[1:44:48] to deliver us in this time of trouble
[1:44:50] just like he would do see why did see
[1:44:53] see Jeremiah would preach and say the
[1:44:55] Lord of hosts sayeth this a different
[1:44:58] things so as the world was going I mean
[1:45:00] as Israel was going into destruction he
[1:45:02] says
[1:45:03] basically all of Heaven is can be at
[1:45:05] your disposal if you call upon him if
[1:45:07] you repent of your sins come back to him
[1:45:09] all of Heaven is there for you the world
[1:45:10] has gone into is going into a judgment
[1:45:12] cycle
[1:45:13] right so all of Heaven is here that we
[1:45:16] can call upon say Lord we have needs we
[1:45:18] have family that needs saving friends
[1:45:19] loved ones we've got sick among us
[1:45:21] troubles aren't you know we need
[1:45:22] direction whatever it is you can call
[1:45:23] upon him and he'll give you whatever you
[1:45:26] have need of that his name would be
[1:45:28] glorified amen
[1:45:31] praise the Lord
[1:45:32] if that's how the musician's place this
