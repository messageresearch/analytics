so while I'm away if you have any needs please see brother come in and so this Wednesday brother Andy's going to take a service then this Sunday brother either gonna be ministering here so you'd have wonderful time and yeah I just trust that yeah god bless you till we see each other next week into next week so let's read Nehemiah chapter 4 and verses 1 to 9 and then we're going to read one scripture from Proverbs 25 and 28 I mean we're all there but it came to pass that when sanballat hurt that he builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation among the Jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do to these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice or they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burnt and the answer is yes they will Tobiah em was by him and he said even that which they built if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall here o our God for we are despised and turn their approach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of activity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked me to anger before the builders so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together under half their all for the people had a mind to work it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the ammonites and the azure delights heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches begin to be stopped then they were very wrong so they got more men and conspired all of them together to come in to fight against Jerusalem and two hundred nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and night because of them and now let's go to proverbs chapter 25 and we're gonna read proverbs 25 and verse 28 is that I mean is everyone there you know it's not fair when it's SWAT kept it to what it you know it's harder when you gotta turn the pages of the Bible but hey as long as we read the same things as fine I've in proverbs 25 and 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit as like a city that is broken down and without walls Amen may the Lord leases were this morning you may have your seats now I'd like to continue my thought about divide and conquer and I'd like to pick up where I was in the first part of this about rebuilding the city and we know from the scripture that Jerusalem the rebuilding of Jerusalem here under Niemeyer and under under Israel and under them that were anointed to rebuild the city and it is the same so in the natural there in the Old Testament it isn't a spiritual in the New Testament so so we are Jerusalem we are that city that's being rebuilt and there comes a point in life where you must recognize God the work he started in your life he will complete it so once we were in chaos once we were broken down once the enemy could just come in and go out and have his way and you know but then there came a time where we're a place of worship was was restored we're a temple was built but that still does not mean that there is the enemy can still have access into that place maybe there's you become the hot place of God's worship by coming under by receiving the Holy Spirit you are you are placed in God's provided place of worship which is Jesus Christ and so a place of worship as is established but then the walls have to rebuilt in your life there has to be a defense against the works of the enemy and now you see here when the believers were anointed a near Myers day to rebuild Jerusalem notice the people around or I'd say the spirits around them they didn't say well we'll just leave them you know let them rebuild this place and we'll see how they do they became angry they became rough Rothfuss anger they were angry at what the believers were doing they were not happy with what they were doing because we won't read it but if you read the book of Nehemiah but earlier than Chapter four they actually wanted to help build but then the Jews that believers said no you have no part in this you have no part in this restoration only God's children have a part in this restoration which is you right and so now they got rough when the walls were being rebuilt now when when you read about them rebuilding Jerusalem they didn't just you know it wasn't just a level place and then they laid the entire foundation I mean they laid the entire bottom section and it all went together that they were rebuilding different parts so there's one stitch and there was totally rebuilt there's another section where the enemy could just step across a few a few stones on the ground right so so it was being rebuilt at different stages now same thing with you there's some things that devil will never come against you to tempt you with because because there's nothing in you that wants that you know there's no there's a defense there's your the wall has been rebuilt in that part of your life so if would come to something like you get got delivered from like alcohol or or smoking or whatever it may be the devil will never come and try and attack you at that again because why would he try and you know why would he build a you know a siege Tower and try and dig under a wall and you know attack a well-fortified piece of a wall of a city when he can just step down here a little bit and just walk across why would you do that that makes no sense so it's the same thing with you and I there's there's parts of our lives that are fortified and there's a garrison there's trained men on the wall and there's the you know this the is not just the barrel mints but the hoarding that's been put up you know if you know anything about castle warfare how they just wouldn't have the stone wall but actually build another part that's called the hoarding over the top of it whether when the arches could stay they're on the battlements they could fire through slits and the and the enemy's arrows couldn't hit them so it's all fortified you got your catapult ready you're all there and so there's parts of your life the devil's not going to attack you then why would he he's not dumb you know he looks stupid he's very cunning he's a very intellectual smart enemy and he studies you a good general studies their opponent and they look at their strengths and look at their weaknesses and you don't try and go I'm just going to hit them in their strengths then you always try to exploit the weakness because you want your victories to be a glorious victory you don't just want a you know a close victory or is even I can't remember the word but there's a type of there is actually worse off than the defeated because in the long term they lose so many men that in the campaign next he ends up in a defeat even though they may win one battle got me bored at school but it is such a thing and so we you got to watch the breaches and your life member we're being rebuilt we're being rebuilt we're a pile of rubble we were a pile of rubble I mean but then God came is it God said I'm going to restore save the Lord I'm going to rebuild the people in my image amen to the enemy can be he can be rampant he can be attacking on every side but there'll be a people I mean there'll be a fortress there'll be a place of defense hallelujah where the enemy can't get in there's no breach there's no gap hallelujah there's no way he can get in but we have to be rebuilt hallelujah and we are being rebuilt aren't you glad immense that's why the enemy when the when the church comes it's been in every age when a people begin to embrace the truth in the enemy gets mad the end the enemy comes against those people it's not about thee you know you go back into Jesus's day you could have joined the Pharisees or the Sadducees or the road Ian's if I'm going to be go for it I may not understand what you're getting into it's a bit different kind of religion go for it but then what imagine one day said now I'm gonna follow this Jesus of Nazareth let's say away from this man had nothing to do with them human people became angry the scribes and Pharisees they became angry how can we destroy him they filled with Ross why because the people were being gathered to be rebuilt how they should have been rebuilt in the beginning I mean that we weren't where it meant to be slaves to the enemy and be a city like without walls but would have a defense when the enemy comes in like a flood or raise up a standard hallelujah so we're not just tossed to and fro by every every feeling or every doctrine or every change in the change in the you know culture or wherever we are or we stand firm and sink or drown good times or bad times pestilence famine whatever it may be victory victory I'd rather die fighting for him I'd rather die on the field standing for my lord amen then there'd be a traitor or or surrender I'd rather die with a sword in my hand wouldn't you amen so it's that yeah that's how we should be if I perish I perish Amen but I don't want to die coward I don't want to just give up to the enemy he doesn't take prisoners Amen he doesn't he has nothing good to give you so we you know Paul says that we are not ignorant to the devil's devices so we should know exactly what he does and how he does it because we can identify what he does and we then it's not a surprise when he comes against us you know that's why it's so it's so precious in this day when you look at the anointings that have been on the church from from from Calvary that's the Holy Ghost but in four different ways he not come on it on the church yeah the first one was the line anointing the word went forth from boldness now as to combat the Antichrist spirit what he was doing and then he a minute changed from that anointing to an ox anointing where the people were told repeat a recant or burn and they said oh I'll take the burden and they took it and they were tortured and they rejoiced and they overcame because the anointing that was upon them it wasn't humanly them doing it it was God's anointing caused him to overcome and then of course the devil changed his tactics again and then it came a man's anointing and intelligence that's where this time of the Reformation where where great learning men you knew multiple languages could translate the Bible you know they could understand telogen s-- but those those those creatures are man and ox and an eagle I mean a man an ox and a lion they're all earthbound they can't see very far but then the last ones the anointing of an eagle and an eagle is Fleiss high he flies high up and he can see very far so these so the man or the lion or the Hawks they can just be walking around what's going on I can't see over that hill let's ask brother Eagle what's going on 15 miles north the enemies there 7 miles southeast there he's he's just over the hill but you you would he's asleep attack but they wouldn't know that if they're just walking along you know sometimes that ambush is a surprise on both sides but an eagle can see and that's why it's so precious the anointing that's come upon the bride in this last age we've been lifted up and we can see from eternity to eternity and we can see what the enemy is doing amen we're not stumbling along blind I trust you not we're not ignorant of his devices remember his killing machine is very it's become very efficient he's refined as methods the enemy has his killing machine yo is not a it's very calculated you just taken the natural you know marketing campaigns and and advertising and certain products there's a lot of research and development that goes into new new technology or new you know big companies they put out new products that's not just I do you think this will work yard might work let's try it there's a lot of planning there's a lot of you know strategy you know they they pick certain times in the year when they release things and it's to show that the it's not a head and mists of fear how even just natural business works it's a refined it's a refined thing now if that's the way just in case your business how much more now you know even you take McDonald's and how the restaurants are made and how the seats are and how the lighting is and how the music is and the decor and the colors and all the and how the food that's all actually been thought out and it's actually been tested and they've done studies and they say well this is how it works this is how we'll do it that is true so if that's the case just a natural how about a being you know that that that walk in the garden of God that was the anointed cherub that covereth loose you're the devil himself Lucifer how much more him that's had thousands of years to study you to study you're not the first human he studied you're not the first one you know he's been studying man since he since he made me go through the serpent look through the bushes and so Adam and Eve they're in the garden he studied them he's looking for a weak point he found a weak point and here we are and soon for the world is what the bride has redeemed but he studies you now if that's the case when you study something I'm laboring on the spawn so when you understand he's very efficient at what he does he's very good at what he does I'm not giving him too much credit because our God is greater than her I mean it we have nothing to fear but we just can't walk on blindly that's why it's so glorious we're where we've been anointed and we were lifted up and we can see what he's doing and then some eagles that there eat snakes and they grab the snake and they lift them up hallelujah and soon as the snake goes off the ground it can't a cat moves like it should actually loses its power you seen those kind Eagles I mean it's just like you oh there's the enemy grab them by the talons lift up into heavenly places hallelujah now I've got you boy what you gonna do amen we have no we don't need to be scared of anything you know we don't know to be we don't need to be afraid of what tomorrow faces I mean you're what we may face we don't need to be scared what's going to happen I know what's going to happen this body is going to be changed I'm going to walk on streets of gold I mean the Bible speaks of the enemy will be under your feet I mean this maybe let's maybe go to Psalms 91 let's just read it I love the work you know there's some work I just love how the Bible's written I already love how the Bible's written I'm in heat it so Sam's 91 and 1 now this is I'm talking I'm talking about you when you read this you say they describe me so well Amen this is you he that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty remember we've been given access into that place by one spirit we're baptized into one body Allu you I say to the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pits o noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust hallelujah have you come to trust have you come to trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor by the arrow that flies by day they meant nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand by thy right but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked what is there a wicked ain't the devil and his angels are going to burn in a lake of fire that's his reward because thou has made the Lord which is which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling yes not just talking about sickness or kind spiritual plagues if is fallen in this day but we have life hallelujah for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways oh my amen thou shalt they shall bear thee up in their hands least our dash thy foot against the stone thou shall tread upon the lion remember he goes about like a lion devouring who he will you shall treat I love that word treat I mean thou shalt thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon thou shall trample under feet I'm talking you you should really be saying it describes me so well I mean I've trampled on him I've trained upon him hallelujah the devil's under my feet I mean he came against me hallelujah he's under my feet hallelujah i I just I I love I just love it this is what he said this is thou shalt it means you're going to Alleluia because he our Lord Jesus has set his love upon me upon you I mean this just now let's just read that out loud but let's change the me I mean because he has set his love upon me you know we can just say that okay let's just let's just read this verse out loud together because he hasn't set his love upon me therefore I will deliver him he will deliver me I will set him on high because he hath known my name hallelujah he knows your name my sheep hear my voice and a stranger though not follow I know my sheep by name and they know me Alleluia he shall call upon me so I will call upon him and he will answer me I will be with him in trouble and you glad you're not alone Alleluia I will he will deliver me I will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation Alleluia oh that doesn't that describe you so good Alleluia so there's a promise now that the enemy we will treat upon him Amen this is a promise in the Bible every promise in the Bible is mine every chapter reverse every line I mean we talk about healing or deliverance but I'll tread upon him he's going to be under my feet hallelujah so now if that is the case we're gonna be a walled city I'm just gonna bring it back into near my that means the enemy won't be able to - he may come against us but we'll we'll stand and the beautiful thing I'd say I just love I'm I just loved kind of warfare and oh yeah but in a city that have little gates hidden gates in the wall and they call it a sally port where the where the defenders would actually rush out and that attacked the your attack the attackers had rush back into their city Alleluia so if the enemy comes against you sure you can stand behind your wall but I say sally forth have you heard that saying before let's sally forth let's take the enemy to him i mean that it's not just let the enemy know this is a warfare of attack and advancement I mean just like David you know he was he was told you know when the enemy came in they took Zig leg and they took all of their families away and he inquired of the Lord he soul attack them take the enemy's camp get back everything that belongs to you hallelujah and we have the same the same anointing the same mandate right we we are called to everything that the devil is taken from us we ever write to get it back I mean the scripture tells us in that story they didn't lose a single family member a Louie they got everything back hallelujah amen so we are called we are called the disaster this does not sit back you say well I'm well fortified the devil can't get me well don't just stay in your fortress sally forth tread on the enemy hallelujah we're called the dort friends let's not just be let just sit back and say well everything's peachy everything's fine you know what belongs to you what belongs to you ever belongs to you get it amen let's not sit back and say well what will be will be no what will be will be what will be will be it's mine why don't I have it it's let's fix this problem I know exactly where I am in this sermon so don't where I'm not trying to fill in time I wasn't think about it you know what is what do you not have amen you should make a list if you think well where's my joy gone where's my peace where's that where's that just that satisfaction that all I care about is him amen because we're going to we're going to stay in a spot where it doesn't matter what happens he is he is my Lord and my king and I love him and all I care about is pleasing him that's that's really you know that spot where you just you just feel his presence and all you care about is him I mean like the woman with the alabaster box all I care about is him hallelujah I'm going to anoint him I'm gonna give him worship I'm gonna give him the service that the rest of the world should have given him hallelujah amen so let's let's not worry about you know we shall tread upon the enemy brother perhaps is when the weakness of Christian gets on their knees who's a Christian today put up your hands are you a Christian okay so when the weakest of Christian gets on their knees the kingdom of hell shake now he doesn't say in praise just gets on their knees to pray okay you say well think about it Alleluia well you say well I'm not feeling strong in the faith know when the weakest of Christian gets up in there you take Israel taking their land let me say no boys let's go take this mountain I'm not feeling all that good today Caleb let's go come with me anyway are you a believer yeah you believe he under the Covenant yes I'm under the Covenant and he one of God's children yes he's called me I mean his Spirit has come upon me something's pulled my heart to him well then you're in the right category to take the mountain let's go hallelujah do we look at we look at ourselves and how we feel and how things are going and well the weeks not gangs are good they're you know therefore I can overcome and no no no no no you looking at the wrong thing a yonder is covenant are you a believer you say well I don't even know if I have the Holy Ghost are you a believer do you believe it's promise I mean do you believe he died for you you're in the right you're in the right category Alleluia amen because many times we you know the Bible speaks in Ephesians of picking up the shield of faith before you quench the fiery darts the enemy holding the shield of faith now it's your faith that quenches the darts because he fires he fires thoughts into your mind you know and then you can't stop the thought coming but it's your faith will paralyze that that error that does you know where it comes you and says you can't receive that the promise is not for you you don't even know you don't understand what this is about I'll tell you I don't understand a whole bunch in here I know the author really well brother Graham said well I may not know the barbary well but I know the author really well if you know the author really well you're in the right place anyway so I'm not even sure binome all that well as they're pulling your heart amen because his he is a is a seed that he's placing us before the foundation of the world and he says all that the father has given me already given me will come to me amen and all that come to me I'll no wise cast out and then we find ourselves you say yeah we get a burden I trust you've been there and if you're still there just say thank you you know you get a burden I'm not happy with my life I want to know what is this all about you know it's more than just living in food and work and my family what you know and I feel a pull and then I come to this this this place where the floor is uneven and all the things like this I love this place hallelujah you know and I hear a word you may have heard it somewhere else it doesn't matter wherever the truth is and there's something pulls in my heart what is that is it God saying this one of mine I'll catch you child come to me hallelujah now the enemy looks for weak spots in our life just thank him for those things you can't buy a burden to meet him you can't buy or work out a longing to know him it's there and he calls you and he calls you and you can you can even run or try and hide it you can't hide it I just give up then we know God does not always the Spirit of God does not always strive with man amen so the first little inkling of it I'd say Lord Jesus Here I am I give up amen because I think I think every believer has the same feeling when they meet him why didn't I why did I not do this years ago amen and you'll find the same thing why did I not just give up years ago I could have given him even more of my youth of my strength amen now he attacks us he looks for weak spots and he tries to attack us there now Jesus we read about in Matthew three and four where Jesus went into the wilderness and and he fasted for 40 days then it says the devil came against them that was his only weak spot he tried to tempt him there I'll read something this is an this is from raising Drossos daughter in 1956 he was a god man he was divine he was virgin born God Jehovah God overshadow a little virgin and brought forth the virgin born son of God and that was a tabernacle or the dwelling place of Jehovah himself Jehovah walked in a tabernacle of flesh and paid the price for sin don't you never let him be a prophet he was the god of the prophets sure was he was more than a good man he was the god of the good men Elisha even now out here on this little old sea tossed about there's when he's on the boat now tossed about ten thousand Devils of the sea swore they drown him while he was laying back they're tired you know the devil takes advantage of you when you get tired of war out amen who's ever been tired of worn-out then the devil comes he begins a fire is that just put up a sign business days are closed later he has to obey you you understand I'm trying to make a joke he has to obey your voice the redeemed he is under the redeemed feet that means the redeemed are in control that means who's redeemed we're going to be in a heaven interactive service today who's ready if you're redeemed therefore he has to obey your voice so if you say go away and come back later what does he have to do I guess I got to go away come back later you know but we we we start having a conversation I mention someone coming to your door at 3:00 in the morning and how are you and you know someone you don't even know I talk to you for a little bit you'd be polite beats a no I've got to go to bed come back at another time but yet the devil comes in when we're worn and tired out you open the door you make him a cup of coffee you sit him down you know and you don't want to he's like the salesman you never want to see but you listen to him you put up with them oh yeah that's right yeah true true yeah yeah remember he's been studying you oh you think you're a believer you think you can overcome you know are you always feel and then you always think these things and if you thought you know - you know the Bible says to the pure all things are pure and you think this way and you do this and you sit there yeah that's right that's right and what are you doing why entertain him why entertaining Satan show him the door and if you only have a cat door push him through there just get rid of him tell him no come back later I'm too tired to talk to you and I don't even want to talk to you anyway shun the door amen he caught Jesus wait he just get you a little tired and worn out and get discouraged hello certainly he caught Jesus right there at that weak spot tired and weary he was lying back in the back of the boat rocking around and the Bible said the storm came down upon the sea and big tossed the boat and the disciple said Karis out not that we perish he said Oh where's your faith he would have been pretty tired they didn't have big boats in those days and it was going up and down like a bottle stopper on a you know on a on a big sea and he's asleep he was worn out from the meetings he just had and the devil comes and tries and gets him there amen what was he doing crossing a rough sea that night because one solon and gatherer was ready to receive him one soul he would come from glory to Shreveport I would say he had come from glory to Stokes Valley I mean for one soul that was ready to receive him I'm so glad he does I remember that this man that was read to receive him was a sick man he was mentally sick he was a maniac that was the maniac in the tombs hallelujah he say well I'm not in a very good place that man was ready to receive him and you're not in that place hallelujah you know we we put too much emphasis on ourselves and we look at ourselves too much look at the state of this wall Nehemiah do you really think this is going to hold up in an invasion he could have see it now he could he could look at that look at the state of you and how victorious you think you are we could look at that or he could say you see that temple over there you see that temple we rebuilt that temple that's God's temple God dwells on that temple he come on that we'd be back here the Prophet Jeremiah said in 70 years we would return and we have returned and we're building and the Bible says that I will restore thus saith the Lord hallelujah and with and we're being restored I'm living the fulfillment so nothing can hinder God's work hallelujah so what are you looking at hey looking at what you think you are he's saying no I'm under a word I'm under a word this is gonna be rebuilt and I'm being rebuilt thank you go back to what you were a year ago six months ago however long ago and compare yourself from there to today and you'd begin to say the battlements have been built there's some soldiers there's some gates being put up oh yeah there's the temples their sacrifices their hallelujah he says now that this been said so this in Hebrews chapter 4 the rooms is that dispensations change when Jesus Christ with Jesus Christ from law to grace from works unto grace from something you do that something God did upon your own merits are upon his parents changed when Moses came out of the wilderness with the law he said thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill keep the Sabbath day holy when Jesus came out of the wilderness as is not a toy when Moses come the devil tempted him and soon as the devil tempted him he heeded to it Moses had a weak spot how many knows what it was temper right and as soon as he had seen them worshiping the gold and cough he threw down the commandments and broke them showing that the priests showing that the priesthood would be broken and God them to him again but when Jesus came out of the wilderness 40 days of fasting he was hungry the only week's body had when there be good to have that's the only weak spot you have I believe will come to there amen because the weak spots you once had they're being rebuilt they're not weak spots anymore hallelujah and the devil came to and said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread do a miracle here let me see you do it and I'll believe you jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he knowed he didn't heat he knowed he didn't meet Moses there for he went to the word that Jesus wouldn't he used the word to combat the works of the enemy took him up to the pinnacle of the temple said if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down and he coated not quoted but coated the scripture said it's written off he'd give the angels charge concerning lease at any time you dash your foot against a stone he'll bear thee up so he came against Jesus in this weak spot now I trust you say well oh I've got some weak spots and if you know where they are then you can cover them you know it's like a boxer when you know brother BAM says we'll just study our opponent and if you study your opponent then at the same time you should be studying yourself because your opponent is studying you and so if you have a weak spot just like a boxer if they need to just have the enemy's got a real good Chuck and they don't know how to combat it they'll get a sparring partner that's got a real good lift up so they can combat what the opponent will do when they're in the room so we need to do the same thing we need to study him you need to study yourself because he may come against you or something and then the person seeing this you could say how could they would be tempted by this and that's because the person one person has a wall where and the other person just has a few few stones but they never came to step across you study your apartment you should study your opponent now when it comes to rebuilding it's not just us personally being rebuilt I said that's why the devil he entices yo his marketing scheme is so good because he's trying to entice you but our God is greater than those things we don't have to walk along with blinders on or live up in a mountain someplace we can walk in this dark world but there's nothing in us to wants it amen we can look at thanks at all I don't want that thing I just want to keep walking on hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad we can be like that by a spirit we can I mean we don't need to fear anything now the family unit is being rebuilt as well we have come to a place where the scripture and we'll read it in in Ephesians of different places where Paul writes about the family unit and we have come to an age where the family unit has been restored and we because as parents now we are not to make the cycle for ourselves and our children we are not called to make little so for example I'm not called to make little Benjamins in my three three girls I am called to make disciples of Jesus Christ in them right so how I raised them shouldn't be they are being molded I am I am being reproduced in them you could say how they act and what they do but it's God should be made in them is that is that clear so so through me they are following him they're not following me only so we need to look into the scripture amen see Paul see follow me as I follow Christ but Paul did not want to make little Paul's when he went around preaching that would have been his worst nightmare he when he went around preaching he wanted to see I travail until Jesus Christ be formed in you I travail endure so he wanted to see Jesus the same God he met would would meet these ones that he preached to and the same God that manifested in his life was now on them and that's that's the kind of disciples he wanted to make and that should be the same thing with our children is that the same God we have met that they would meet him as well now there's an influence in 1963 he says I picked up one day when Billy Sunday's Tabernacle as I was at one of the first meetings there and I liked it so much and I hung it I took it and hang it in my house and I kept it until it fell apart I'm still talking about rebuilding I'm just going to more of a family a family way and it was saying like this go no place you so go no go no place you would not want to be if Jesus should come that was the same be saying nothing that you would not want to be saying if Jesus should come and it went on with many things saying in other words whatever you do or say or whatever action you're performing do not do it if you do not want to be caught in that position when Jesus come if we could only do that I'm sure to be a great influence upon our associates and you know the right there's two ways of to do anything that's right and wrong because I had my little son Joseph in my lap the other day and I said to me he's 8 years old and some little boy had stepped on his toes and he and the little boy had a fight I said Joseph don't do that but daddy he did such-and-such I said but that doesn't matter see what he did just remember Joseph you love your father he said Ye steady he said remember that people are going to look at your life as a minister's son and then if you do anything wrong then they're going to say does this minister permit his child to do such now we know they do it anyhow but we know that but as Christians we know that we are trying to bring up our children right but it's a good thing to keep that forefront so before them before them all the time to do what's right don't never take that other side and I see it because you see it doesn't only reflect on you Joseph but it reflects on your mother it reflects on your sisters it reflects on your sister and the very sorry on your father and the very cause of the family that we're standing for and then what we stand for it flex on that on Jesus Christ and you don't want to do that I said our Lord told us if anybody smite us on one cheek turn the other and of course that's kind of hard for a little boy with a hot temper to begin with to think such things but place it before him anywhere anyhow see that he should not do it he's triumphant influence so we should put influence in front of our children amen not to take the wrong side but take what the what what the Bible says to do amen let's read go to Colossians on access go to it let's just go to Ephesians chapter 6 and we I think we're just going to basically hold for the rest the service on here actually now Ephesians six and for our patients six and one down to four and then we're actually going to go back into Ephesians chapter five where you're going to start and we're gonna go up because we expect our children to be good and to obey and to listen and and you know toe the line but the influence you place upon them so I read that quote because little Joseph Branham was born with a nature that is dad and he received from his family so he received a certain kind of nature so there that that is in us whatever nature does we can be high-tempered high-strung we can be so relaxed that you know people think you have no care in the world you know whatever spectrum you know you're in the spectrum we have we are born with a certain nature but we have to raise our children such a way that they don't lean upon that nature necessarily but they lean upon how God because member a man has no control of his spirit is like a city with no walls so now the devil looks at your nature and he'll use your nature against you and if you have no defensive of the Spirit of God and you know God's Word then you're in your absolute and how you respond to things will be based on your nature okay but if God is in you and as word as it you know you know it's not just in here what I'm trying to say but as word is in here and it's a life that's what I'm trying to say if it's the end of life and when things come your way then God can teach you and say don't respond that way as you would tanley but respond according to my word because if you respond according was word then you have a wall then you have a defense as if I'm with me right so effecient six and one children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth so children whose hello all the children can I have your attention now all of the children who wants to serve the Lord young child yeah gonna be a christian and serve the lord yep well this is actually how you serve at a young age and I didn't hear anything from the kids sake but this is actually how you serve God at a young age you obey your parents in the Lord for this is right so anything that they tell you to do that is in the Lord you obey it and you honor them you know what it means to honor someone treat them better how even how you'd want to be treated have the best seat can I get you anything a thirst you have you know you know someone comes in awe how can I honor you how can I treat you with respect how can I you know how could I give you reverence and really show my appreciation and love for you hello children are we here it says honor your parents honor your father and mother and the Lord for this is right and so he's giving instruction now if you want to if you really want to serve the Lord even at a young age on your father and mother but this is right this is godly instruction it's well they're all rigid and they I'll just say this the younger generation now here I sell movies over at all but the young and you and you only realize this when you get older the younger generation doesn't really does not have experience of what it's like to really be in this world when you're young you know especially when you hit about 18 you think I know it all why doesn't the world just ask me how to solve the problem I'll fit you know you think you're bulletproof and you know everything but then you walk a little bit in life and you begin to realize man I really don't know too much and when you're about 18 17 18 you think man mum and dad know nothing they're old-fashioned they don't understand what's going on and then you begin to experience life a little but and then you realize they actually know quite a lot because they've experienced a lot of things amen and so but the younger generation we always make a mistake when you're young because you think they don't know what they're talking about and that is not honoring your father and mother they meant because if you really if you and problem is hindsight is a great thing to look back and say yeah they were right back there but you need to actually understand there's a reason why Paul is saying honor thy father and mother because you've got to realize they actually know what they're talking about they've actually the same devils every all of us are fighting an enemy doesn't matter what age but the same Devils that our parents fought we fight or we will fight it just changes its name you take one you know you take music for example our parents fought maybe a demon of rock and roll but then the popular genre just changes but it's the same spirit and now we fight against that the younger generation fights against that and so we have to we but the thing is now as parents we have to be aware of that well why are they fighting this well it's because you fought it and the devil studied you and he knows if it can work against the parents that are working against the children I mean that's why we're going to be that's why we're going to be careful but we're going to be aware but then children you know I was where were we were an arm we're in laughs a lots play Lane yesterday had a good day I did but anyway I was just looking at everyone and there's a big room full of people I was looking anywhere I thought if one is actually alone this world is alone if one is you know people are there it may be a birthday party they're doing things but everyone just looks alone the devil is coming and he separated us we can be living in this world as a lonely place we can be living in house full of people full of family but we can be alone because the devil draws our attention away and we try and draw strength from from something on the internet or Facebook or whatever it is and he's just and he gets it in our minds they don't understand what I'm going through but we forget and we listen to that yeah they don't because they're old well they're young wherever you are in the you know but we forget our parents fault the same Devils that we fight so they actually can relate that's why it's so important you got to think like brother Brahim said think just say a 14 year old whatever I'd you to think those thoughts yes I mean so I've got to think five and a half year old thoughts Allu yeah you know I've got to think four year old thoughts and two and a half year old thoughts to actually understand what they're going through I mean you have to because you got to go down remember God came when we were lost and undone what did he do he came down to your level wherever that was Emirates all all cinesín there's not players that may manifest in different ways unbelief is unbelief so wherever we're in darkness he came down to where you were he didn't he didn't just stay up there where I could not go when I could not go to where he was he came to me the same with our children we have to go down onto their level you got to be able to relate to them but they just doing all these things day you got to be able to relate to them because you got to bridge maybe the devil wants to make a gulf between the parents and the children he was to create a gulf and how does that golf normally start well the children say he doesn't understand me and the parent says I don't understand him and now we can't relate to each other and now there's a gulf and then then what happens well if there's a gulf and I can't relate to to this one even though I love them or love her parent I'll try and find fulfillment in something else oh yes they turned us in it and it's this but spheal different kinds of things before but the devil just rebrands and changes its product but ultimately he just wants to separate and make and that's why this world especially this this this world of New Zealand such a high suicide rate one of the highest suicide rates in the world and we have everything this is the first world and yet people suicide depression massively high levels why because people are alone they live in families they have community but they're alone we're not called to be alone nothing was made to be alone when God looked at ad missus it's not good that man should be alone and so but you say well I am I'm not alone I have all my family around me and thinks but can you really relate to them do you ever do you ever even just talk to them have a relationship do you amen yeah there's been studies but these other studies that disprove it but I believe is true there's a people have been done studies and children's welfare and and and their success in life and different things they have actually attributed it to just families having meals together because what now now there's community now there's actually more than community now this relationship and a family now there's stability because this is my identity this is where I belong Amen do you know where you belong amen and so and it's such a big impact what do you mean just having you know I was okay so if I'm not plugging putting a plug in for life a lots but there's a right of buddies cause you sit and you go around in a circle I went on that thing I don't know how many times yesterday but the thing is it was it wasn't it's like Gabriel we wanted everything we were just on Mia for hours literally but and she said daddy let's go on this one it's gone this one the same just different causal time but she wanted children are looking for the hair experiences with the appearance I mean the things I remember growing up it's not sitting on a computer playing computer games till dawn till dusk and then you know those are the things I really remember things I remember is being outside playing war playing cricket you know going to the beach spending time with my yeah my dad used to take a sailing on the weekends going to the living holidays or even just just being at home doing doing things but that builds because that builds memories and that so that builds you know that builds relationship you say this is very elementary it is but sometimes we forget so that would have been if we could get Gabriel you know up here and you say well how was yesterday I'd anyway with me on these cars we had a great time and endless and Lilia too and I would look at it say well I'm just sitting on this car this is not such a big deal to me you know but to the image it's five has a far greater impact you understand so we may look at all this is just this and this is you know we just going through our day but they think this is this is great I'm spending time with daddy and mummy and we're having this is this is us now we have to come down to their level the older generation and you can see it even in the Bible we have Solomon's son Israel so Solomon's son becomes king now there's a prophecy that the that to it you know there's going to be a split in the in the kingdom and the son now he consults the the the men that were with his father Solomon because the people come to him and say don't taxes so much don't give us so greater burdens like your father did and then so the son is now on the throne and I forget his name just now forgive me for that he asked the advisors that his father had the older men and they said listen to the people but then he asked his friends as peers and they said this is how you show them that you're a real man what greater taxation on them give them greater burden and he listened to them he listened to his peers and it was a bad mistake because he lost most the kingdom yeah I mean that's why I said you know but they didn't have the experience that the older mean here it says an in verse 4 and ye father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so says don't don't provoke them don't make them angry this isn't in Colossians 3 and 20 and verse 21 maybe we'll jump there really quicker I know probably timers timers escaping us just now but these things you say well don't underestimate simple things you say well this is not some great big thing it is because remember if you're making disciples you have to start somewhere you gotta start somewhere and then you go from there you know what's the good of me telling telling my girls and because you know they're down on a level Jesus loves us this we know for the Bible tells us so and he died on the cross to take us to heaven these are fundamental and they mean probably more to me than when I tell them that they mean to them he died on the cross to take us to heaven he gave us life and in our place because we should have died but he died in our place to take us to heaven and Jesus loves us and his angels are with us and we have nothing to fear and He loves us so much and look how wonderful he is and he's alive those are the things we talked about what good would it be to to say now this is the seven seals but telling telling us telling them Jesus loves us and he died taking us to heaven that is the seventh this part the seventh seal is redemption but what is the good of actually saying now brother Graham said this and he's a big you know here's a timeline and this is where everything happened and they're like five and a half you know you can't and and this is what this means and you know we were thought in God's mind and you know the seed fare our thought found us and you know that's a dandy I want an ice cream so they wouldn't build to understand you gotta start somewhere it's just like when you start in school you learn how to write you don't start with algebra and you know working out the velocity of a mass in three-dimensional space if anyone's done engineering you know you don't you don't you don't start with that you start down here and then you got there but you have to be careful we we rejoice in these things and they're glorious but you gotta be able to break it down because ultimately hey God found us in the darkness he lifted us up to where where he is and so we have to do the same thing you know any of God's got to be in us that we can lift our children like we can hear a sermon about about the token about Rahab and and Esther and all those glorious things we rejoice in but then we're going to break it down to them what did so what happened to do wha what what are you talking about this ah I like that you know you gotta be able to break it down to them can you do that they just don't understand what I'm saying you've got to make it more simpler because we can't assume just because they come to church that they actually catch what is going on or they understand things you know yeah there's been people people raised in the message 15 16 years old they thought it was still an apple in the garden because pictures in a children's Bible and the parents assume they'll just understand soup and seed and all these different things just by osmosis just by absorbing it but just because they're people sit in church and they hear that doesn't mean they catch it that's why you've got to have fellowship about these things you say well that's too that's too much for a child maybe it is I don't know but you be able to break it down because they will but you can't tell the rules an apple it wasn't an apple because why did Jesus have to be virgin born why it'd have to be blood you know why did why are we in these why do we need redemption why are we in these hybrid fallen conditions where did this all come from you go start somewhere now Colossians 3 and 20 and 21 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord who wants to please the Lord as a chapel children the hands wrapper well yeah maybe you're fine but it's a lot of who is young here who who's a child I'm a child too but this is well pleasing to the Lord yeah actually want to say now this may be a double-edged sword then we say children you want to please Jesus yeah we do we do do you want me to tell you how to do it yeah we do you gotta obey us and all things but it's a it's a commandment it's a commandment it is well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger at least they be discouraged see Paul links are two together children obey your parents fathers do not provoke your children to anger they men now let's go back to Ephesians again go back to Ephesians 5 that's gonna skip now no wait before you say that we might even get there but it says fathers provoke your children not to anger because how children relate to God will be based on how you treat them subconsciously because God is our Father and subconsciously they'll begin to think how you daddies are to them nothing that's how God is to them so for example so we have to ask and not just dads but mums as well how our character in our nature has to be a divine word that we need when they hear about God's character in God's nature they should be able to say that's like mommy and daddy that's like Daddy because we don't want to it can be the hardest thing is because you're putting an image you're putting an image in front of your children whether you say it or not you're actually saying because God is in me this is how God as a person and how he is because I'm dead I don't live anymore it's no longer either liveth but Christ liveth in me so therefore my nature and what I say and the things I do and how I act and how I treat and that's how God would and flesh amen so we have to be very all God help us that the image we put in front of them this is Jesus the image we put in front of them because an image like you say well I talked to them about the Lord and we sing songs and we come to church that is them growing up mostly there's just a small part of what they think Jesus is it's actually how you treat them as and printing upon them this is how God is to me and so we have to be very careful that how we treat them and how we speak to them that's how God would in flesh and all children say Amen thank you so you say well how can that be so if your father is distant and people will begin to think that God is distant you know if well father never took interest in me my dad never took interest in me then people begin to think God doesn't really care about me he doesn't care about the details of my life now is that true that's not true God has interested in every part of us you know sometimes we may pray and think well this is such a simple little prick but he wants you to tell him about it hallelujah he wants you to tell him how your day is been you think well he he already knows about it but he wants me because he wants to build he wants to build a relationship with you and how is the best way to build a relationship when the child or in case us with God we open ourselves up and begin a talk from our hearts to him amen now if the father is always angry we think God's always angry if we can never please father then we can think we can never please God and people always think they could never obtain the promise they can never measure up they can never you know become what they call to be in him because fathers always angry always raises the benchmark all this is wrong this is wrong as wrong as wrong and it builds a complex Amen so the father's character nature should be God's nature she's in 2nd Peter 1 and 4 it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be takers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust this is we are to be partakers of his divine nature amen to be a Christian is to be christ-like and the only way he can be christ-like of us Jesus Christ is in you so we have to have his divine nature proverbs 22 and 6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart for as I said it's like natural training when it comes to anything you don't start off with the algebra and the and you know and those things matrices and as I see the object moving through the three-dimensional space and the effects that the everything has on it you start with one plus one is two so to train up a child you could have start at the simple things and then as they grow you grow with them in terms of their training now don't ever think that if you're in God's service your children will automatically turn out fine don't you ever think that for a second you say well we're in the New Testament now we're under the blood of Jesus Christ I'm doing I'm doing the Lord's perfect well therefore my children are just going to push a button that's like God will push a button and then they'll be there don't ever assume that because that is not God has given us children and we're to be stewards over them to look after them to raise them to nurture them in the faith now this is an Old Testament example but it's the same today because man does not change let's go to 1st Samuel - and we may finish on this point then I thought time has got away on us First Samuel - and in verse 12 they were reading here it says so Samuel - and 12 it says now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial they knew not the Lord now Eli was the high priest in those days if you're running who Eli was so he was the high priest and he was he was in a god-ordained position but his children his sons did not know the Lord so he did not raise him in a way that they could actually walk step into his footsteps should the Lord take him off the scene because ideally isn't that what we want if the world if time goes on and say the rapture is I've know 50 years away I don't believe it is but just say you know timers going on and all these children here are now adults and they have have taken our place and we're in the grave someplace what would we want for them that the same God that we know they know so the same God that lives in this generation will live in a future generation that's what we want but but his children did not know the Lord he failed as a dead even though he is high priest no well what why is this it's because when he corrected his sons he didn't actually enter emblem in their correction now let's go down to this guy so we're at First Samuel 2 and we'll go down to verse 22 so first amulet to him ago verse 22 and we'll read down to verse 25 now when God Crixus he doesn't just he sends warning and then judgment there's been god creaks so there should be the same thing with us we can't just send warning and warning and warning and warning because and now I'm very much preaching to me right now but our voice should not be just idle noises and the ears of our children it can't just because that's they'll think God is that way Oh God doesn't know it just like you know when we say hey stop doing that or do this we'll come here you know we're not making them robots for they should pay attention daddy's speaking mummy speaking and it's like when God speaks Oh God speaking I need to listen to this this is important yeah now when sorry to you thank you now Eli was very old and he heard all that his sons didn't and all Israel how they lay with the woman that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and he said unto them why do you say things for I hear of your evil dealings with by all those people that name my sons it is not good it is it is sorry for it is no good report that I hear you make the Lord's people to transgress if one man sin against another the judge shall judge them but if a man sin against the Lord who shall entreat for him no was standing they hearkened not under the voice of this father because the Lord would slay them now he just said you shouldn't do this why didn't he really deal with them it's because he didn't raise them in the right way just you know just this is real elementary but think about it their their relationship had degraded to such a point now this is just me that has his sons his sons are not one fair God and to really obey what their father was saying even though he is the high priest they their fear of God was lost and they was sitting right before the tabernacle there and in our human mind we think how could they sin around the church like that so close and being a priests office wouldn't they fear God dealing with them well you'd think so but their fear of God was not there and they didn't listen to their death because he didn't deal with him now well when did this start with no grown up nose went up yeah now let's go down to verse 34 because now it's going to add speaking of Samuel because we know he owes Eli and then Samuel became the high priest but the prophets Oh Samuel well I may have that wrong but first samuel turn in 34 it says and this shall be a sign unto thee so this is actually a proper comes and speaks against Eli and this shall be a sign unto thee that thou shall come upon that shall come upon my two sons on hoth my and and phineas and one day they shall die both of them and I'll raise me up faithful priests that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind and I'll build a mature house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever now this is this is Samuel I will raise me a faithful priest and he'll do all that which is my heart of our mind he'll do it now Samuel did that but now if we drop down to 1st Samuel 8 in 1 samuel was a faithful priest amen he wasn't like Eli he was a faithful priest but he didn't raise his children right 1st samuel 8 and 1 and it came to pass when Sammy was old that him his sons judges over Israel now the name of his firstborn was Joel and they moved sick and was was ever I can't pronounce that they were judges in Beersheba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after Luca and took bribes and perverted judgment well what's happened the same failings of Eli in a regard now came in to Samuel but Samuel and himself was a faithful priest he was he did everything God put in his mind and hard to do well how would how would this now humanly this is me because Samuel saw the sins of Eli sons and Eli and their failings so he would have thought in his mind I'm just gonna serve God with all my heart I'm gonna do everything 110% and I believe he did but he neglected that which was closest to him and they did not walk in his steps the way they should have okay I'm saying all these things because just because whoa we're the Bride of Christ amen we're going in a rapture amen we are living the perfect will of God for our lives walking according to his word amen we are spotless deemed in the blood wash pure and white Amy but don't neglect don't just say well God will take care of them I'm busy I've got things to do this world is a busy place it's been made very busy sometimes I pray lord I wish I'd lived in the day where I wasn't connected 24/7 to everything at once would have been so nice I'll send you a letter wait a few miles for it to come across the sea you know snail mail see no mail today oh no there's no mail today you know but we live in a connected age there's a pressure in this age but let's not neglect those things which actually most dear to us amen because in order for the family to be united to be restored there has to be a relationship amen and there has to be one goal I trust you parents have a goal I want them there with me amen that's really the five people well that includes me the most see in all the world sure this might you know my parents bikes you know that family you know my my natural family that way but if there were five people that would go in a rapture I'd want me my wife and my three girls that would be my heart that be my greatest heart's desire I believe it'd be far more than that but you know what I mean wouldn't you be the most wouldn't that make you the most happy sure you'd be happy to see everyone else maybe where's my children where's my wife oh they're here hallelujah there'd be the most joy wouldn't it that's why we need to focus if we need to rearrange our lives you say well I got a busy schedule I got busy you really just prioritize and get rid of stuff that's not important just just get rid of it amen we have some musicians to come say well this is a bit different it's always different but I want you to think about these things because we can't neglect those things that are most near India because it's just like brother Steve person see that and you know the camp we had last October the youth camp he said their heart will be attracted somewhere else their affections will be somewhere else you know when up when our children look at us they should really out the heroes should be us when they're young you know they should be when our grub on will be just like mommy or just like Daddy they're my heroes amen that's how they should be and if that is the case that means their heart hasn't wandered out somewhere it was it's more obvious when they're young when they're all those not so obvious because they you know growing everything but amen let's stand shall we build up the breach justice has been helpful yeah it's um do you have a song brother Isaac I'm sorry I'm blank I'd love to I'm saying we're looking for a city here among the shadows here and dissapointment often we so sadly roam we do but don't be discouraged by
