[2:32] Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[2:40] [Music]
[4:44] I do.
[5:13] [Music]
[7:04] Praise the Lord. Good morning,
[7:06] everyone. Welcome to church this
[7:08] morning.
[7:09] It's good to um it's it's I'm I'm always
[7:14] so grateful
[7:16] to to understand, you know, that we
[7:19] didn't just get here by chance, but the
[7:21] Lord actually decided that he was going
[7:23] to call me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have
[7:24] any interest in responding to his call.
[7:27] It it wouldn't interest me. This
[7:29] morning, I would be doing something
[7:30] different than waking up and driving
[7:33] along to
[7:34] church, you know. And I when you get
[7:36] older, I don't do it because someone
[7:38] drags me along. I do it because I want
[7:39] to I want to serve the Lord. I want to I
[7:42] want to be on his team. I want to I want
[7:46] to push his work forward each day. I
[7:49] want to I want to fight for the kingdom
[7:51] of the Lord for his for the kingdom of
[7:54] light. I want to make put my effort in
[7:56] to further that that
[7:58] kingdom. and and you know when I on at
[8:01] the end of the road I'd like to think
[8:03] that it's not to it's not to try and get
[8:07] any to get more
[8:11] uh what would it be to earn my salvation
[8:14] more because that's been fully paid
[8:16] for. But in in recognition of what the
[8:19] Lord's done for me, I enjoy fighting for
[8:20] his kingdom. And I like it when it moves
[8:22] forward a
[8:23] bit. And I and I like and and and who
[8:26] likes
[8:28] winning? I like when the kingdom of God
[8:30] wins in situations. I'm like,
[8:33] "Yes, I like fighting the good fight of
[8:35] faith and I like
[8:37] winning." And and we're on the winning
[8:39] team. And you know, anytime we stand by
[8:40] faith and move forward for the Lord, we
[8:42] can assure that we always win. So, and
[8:46] you know what? you just by showing up,
[8:47] no matter how you feel, just by showing
[8:49] up and warming a pew is actually winning
[8:52] and you're pushing the kingdom of God
[8:54] forward, you know, you're you're you're
[8:56] inspiring people. You're you're you're
[8:59] you're moving forward in the Lord. So,
[9:01] let's um let's stand this morning and
[9:04] um just pray. Heavenly Father, we we
[9:06] thank you so much that we have the
[9:07] opportunity to come and praise and
[9:09] worship you this morning.
[9:11] Lord, we know that we we can't earn our
[9:13] way into salvation that you've paid the
[9:15] you you've paid the full price for us,
[9:17] Lord, but ultimately you just wanted us
[9:19] to come and praise and worship and to
[9:21] fellowship with you, Lord. So, we we
[9:23] come this morning not to show ourselves
[9:25] that we're anything, but we come to
[9:26] worship you. We come to praise you. We
[9:28] just come to fellowship with you this
[9:29] morning, Lord. And may just bless us,
[9:31] bless the worship, rest, bless the
[9:34] praise, Lord. You you said you you tell
[9:36] us that you in inhabit the praises of
[9:39] your people, Lord. So as we praise this
[9:40] morning, Lord, we believe you're in our
[9:42] midst, Lord, and you're with us as we
[9:43] praise, as we worship, as we gather in
[9:45] your name, Lord. So we know we don't
[9:47] come to a God that's just a a figment of
[9:49] our imagination, Lord, but we we come to
[9:51] the living God this morning that's
[9:53] moving in our midst, Lord, that's
[9:54] touching every heart, Lord, that's more
[9:57] real than what we can see this morning,
[9:58] Lord. Even though we come to the unseen
[10:00] God, Lord, and yet you can do things in
[10:02] our in our life in an unseen way, Lord,
[10:05] and they manifest into our reality,
[10:07] Lord. So we just want to pray you'll
[10:08] touch every heart, fill every heart with
[10:10] the Holy Ghost this morning. Fill us
[10:11] with love, with joy, with peace, with
[10:13] longsuffering, Lord, with strength,
[10:15] Lord. You said those they that wait upon
[10:17] you shall renew their strength. Lord,
[10:19] may each one here be strengthened this
[10:21] morning. But when we leave, Lord, we
[10:23] we're going to be stronger than we were
[10:24] when we came, Lord, and we're going to
[10:26] be strengthened to press the battle and
[10:28] fight the good fight of faith, Lord. So
[10:29] we just commit the service to your hands
[10:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[10:32] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm
[10:35] feeling good this morning.

[26:40] And you can take your seats this
[26:41] morning. We have a um Sunday school skit
[26:46] for you this morning.
[27:18] [Applause]
[27:35] Good morning everyone. So men are just
[27:39] as Sunday school teachers, aren't we?
[27:41] And we've watched these little guys grow
[27:43] together. I think when we came to
[27:45] Wellington, Noel and Anelise were six
[27:47] months old. And we used to watch Anelise
[27:50] and have Sunday school back then.
[27:52] Brunwin Clifford, I'm glad you're here
[27:54] because she was like the Sunday school
[27:56] guru. Um, she remembers all these guys.
[27:59] So, they've grown. Look at them. And
[28:02] they keep growing. They're actually
[28:03] getting taller than Isaac and myself,
[28:05] but that's not hard to do. So, um, uh,
[28:08] so this is the Dove's class. This is the
[28:11] older youth. Um, and we've got Jonno,
[28:15] Fangi, Liam, Abraham, Ruben, Mo, Juel,
[28:19] Noel, Ama, Anelise, and Lilia. So, we'll
[28:22] give them a big round of
[28:25] applause. Um, because they're growing in
[28:29] an age where we didn't have to as
[28:31] parents. They have a lot I think they
[28:33] have it a lot harder than what we do.
[28:36] So, you're doing well, guys. Um, so
[28:38] we're going to um we have a Sunday
[28:40] school lesson. Actually, we I've been
[28:42] asked multiple times what I'm doing in
[28:44] my Sunday school lesson because you guys
[28:46] watch us bring all the food in multiple
[28:49] times. So, uh, we're going to give you a
[28:50] rundown of our Sunday school lessons.
[28:53] So, uh, this is your adult Sunday school
[28:55] lesson for the day. All right,
[28:59] guys.
[29:00] Yeah. So, while they are getting ready,
[29:04] I thought I would just explain a few
[29:05] because we're going to demonstrate the
[29:08] point that we got to of the Sunday
[29:10] school lessons. I wasn't sure what to
[29:12] do. Actually, I was like, "Ah, these
[29:14] guys are bigger. I don't really do big.
[29:16] I only do like little guys and can be
[29:18] silly with them." But um so I was
[29:20] praying on my knees praying because I
[29:21] was a little bit nervous actually and
[29:24] the Lord gave me a thought to um do the
[29:27] banqueting
[29:28] table. So I thought okay great cuz um uh
[29:33] yeah not that we are in competition a
[29:36] Priscilla to be the best Sunday school
[29:38] teachers or
[29:40] anything. Um and I thought that's great.
[29:43] Um because then I get to feed them. So
[29:46] um so I was very thankful to the Lord
[29:49] that we got to do the banqueting oh
[29:52] table and the the thing that I wanted to
[29:55] show them was I didn't grow up in a
[29:57] Christian background. I gave them my
[29:59] testimony. So I kind of started with a
[30:02] testimony. So I grew up in quite a
[30:04] worldly
[30:05] home. There were drugs and alcohol and
[30:09] um what parties and just things that the
[30:13] like having a um Yeah, quite a lot of
[30:17] fights in the family home, etc., etc.,
[30:19] that these guys don't have to
[30:21] necessarily deal with. Um, and I wanted
[30:24] to show them and also even though they
[30:27] might go through hard times, what I
[30:29] didn't have as a child was the wisdom of
[30:31] God that he's with us. So, I wanted to
[30:34] show them, hey guys, God's given you a
[30:37] lot. And I wanted to show them naturally
[30:40] and I wanted to show them spiritually.
[30:42] So
[30:44] naturally, oh, do we cover all the
[30:46] tables? There's one more tablecloth.
[30:48] There's one more tablecloth. So we Oh,
[30:51] just make it just make it look nice,
[30:54] guys. Okay. So, um, so I wanted to show
[30:57] him naturally what he's given us because
[30:59] it's a type of what he's given us
[31:01] spiritually, right? So, um, so he's
[31:04] given us the Bible. We do not live in a
[31:06] country that we get persecuted. We can
[31:08] hold our Bibles around. We can read it
[31:10] out loud. We can shout at it to people
[31:13] if we really want to. Um we do we're not
[31:16] going to be thrown in jail for it. The
[31:18] other thing is um he gave us a
[31:20] messenger. So we're not grappling. When
[31:23] I when I first came became a Christian,
[31:25] I uh got
[31:28] um converted, I guess you'd say. The
[31:30] Lord met me at a Baptist church. So when
[31:32] I read the Bible, it was just stories.
[31:35] And God was this God and the Holy Spirit
[31:39] flew around and Jesus was his son. And I
[31:42] prayed to who did I pray to now? I
[31:44] prayed to the Holy Ghost. Maybe I prayed
[31:46] to God. Maybe. But it wasn't I knew God
[31:48] was real and I'd met Jesus. But God sent
[31:52] us a messenger
[31:54] to tell us who God
[31:56] is. Then you know who you're praying to.
[31:59] I said, "Oh my." So, we I showed them
[32:02] while we were eating and I was telling
[32:04] them, "Man, he's given us so much. And
[32:06] look what we got. We got sermons coming
[32:08] out of our ears. We've got our
[32:11] phone. We've got the table on here. We
[32:14] can listen to messages. We can watch
[32:16] messages. We can like we've got so much
[32:19] in this day. It's crazy." So, I had them
[32:22] all sitting around eating, which they
[32:23] loved.
[32:25] Um, and then it dawned on me the next
[32:27] Sunday school. So I thought, okay, well,
[32:30] does he want us just to get fat? Like,
[32:32] does he want us just to sit around and
[32:34] eat all the good stuff and enjoy being a
[32:37] Christian or what does he want us to
[32:39] do at the table? He wants us to eat at
[32:42] the table every day, of course, but what
[32:44] after that? Okay, so that came to the
[32:47] next Sunday school lesson, which was the
[32:50] greatest commission of all. And that was
[32:52] their Sunday school lesson or Sunday
[32:54] school verse which um being nervous I
[32:58] won't remember offh
[33:00] hand give me a moment
[33:04] um and he said unto them go into all the
[33:07] world and proclaim the gospel to the
[33:09] whole to every creature right that's the
[33:12] greatest commission and he said don't
[33:14] worry about it go tell don't all these
[33:17] signs will follow you but go tell and
[33:20] even adman he said, "Go tell to every
[33:22] creature." So when Isaac and I were
[33:24] running past cows, I'm like, "God loves
[33:27] you." Cuz I really like cows, too. He's
[33:29] like, and it was after the sermon,
[33:30] Isaac's like, "You just preached to the
[33:32] creatures, did you?" I'm like,
[33:34] "Yes." Cuz he heard this sermon as well.
[33:37] So if you see me yelling at animals on
[33:39] the side of the road, I'm just telling
[33:40] him Jesus loves them. And I also told
[33:42] these guys, actually, a lot of people
[33:44] need to know that Jesus loves them
[33:46] because we're being told
[33:49] daily people hate you. You know, Satan's
[33:52] going around telling kids, these guys,
[33:54] especially this age, teenage age, your
[33:57] parents hate you, your all your friends
[34:00] hate you, the school hates you. Satan's
[34:02] just going, "Hate, hate, hate, hate,
[34:04] hate." But we as Christians need to say,
[34:06] "Love, love, love, love, love. Jesus
[34:08] died for you. You're loved." Right?
[34:11] Okay. So now that takes us to the next
[34:14] thing and this is the conclusion of the
[34:16] Sunday school. Okay. Let me show you
[34:19] this. Where'd that white Oh, here we
[34:23] go. Okay. Now I'll just This is old
[34:28] school, right? I didn't I didn't want to
[34:30] do it on the the projector just
[34:34] yet because we didn't have one up there.
[34:38] Okay. So, excuse me for a moment. You go
[34:40] startled, "What are we doing?" And I had
[34:43] to yell to the children like that. So,
[34:45] they'd be startled, which I think
[34:46] Analise actually dropped her her donut
[34:49] on the ground. But I wondered, you think
[34:53] about it, I wonder if God actually tells
[34:55] us that. What are we doing when we're
[34:58] sitting there on our phone scrolling?
[35:01] What are we doing when we're walking
[35:03] down the park, you know, somewhere doing
[35:05] nothing? What are we doing? It's like
[35:07] they're souls, right? So then I
[35:10] explained we come from God. This is
[35:13] where we are. We have all eternity to
[35:16] rest, to relax, to go on vacation. This
[35:20] is our
[35:20] vacation. Okay. This is where we come
[35:23] from. This is our vacation. This is
[35:25] where we are. We have a very, very short
[35:29] amount of time. Okay. AB, I'm gonna do
[35:32] it. I'm gonna do it. Okay. He said he
[35:34] don't want to do any plays with me
[35:35] because I cry. But um see that we've got
[35:39] a very very short amount of time. Okay.
[35:43] So this brings us to the conclusion of
[35:45] our Sunday school lesson. All right guys
[35:47] ready? Let's get into
[35:49] positions. You hold
[35:52] on. Okay. Thanks
[35:55] Liam. All right. So we've got the Lord.
[35:59] And now these are Christians going to be
[36:01] coming up and especially around their
[36:03] age. So with our short amount of time,
[36:06] what are we doing? A lot of Christians
[36:09] these days, it's all about self. It's
[36:12] all about selfies. It's all about image.
[36:15] It's all about flash cars. It's all
[36:18] about houses. It's all about material
[36:21] things. But what happens at the end of
[36:24] the road? Do we keep them? Do they burn
[36:27] up?
[36:28] Do we all we have is our character,
[36:31] right? Yeah. Just
[36:33] sad.
[36:36] Sad. So they came to
[36:38] heaven with nothing. They got
[36:42] there. Okay. Yet
[36:49] next. And then we've got Oh, this dawned
[36:51] on me. So guys are geared with special
[36:54] things because they're made in God's
[36:56] image really. And they're real
[36:57] important. men,
[37:00] males. Okay, wait. Let me don't don't
[37:02] move. So So young men and men, you guys
[37:06] are made so special, okay? And Satan
[37:08] knows it. So he's made you guys
[37:11] warriors. He's made you guys like you
[37:13] want to win and you're competitive and
[37:16] he's taken that nature. So Satan in the
[37:19] Leadyian church age has taken that
[37:21] nature and he's given you stuff that you
[37:23] can see, which is I've won this goal.
[37:27] See that? And and you get to watch the
[37:29] crowds go. Yeah. So, you're popular and
[37:33] you get to put all your time and energy
[37:34] on earth into something that
[37:37] what are you going to take it with you?
[37:40] Go ahead and take it. And what happens
[37:42] when one soul comes to Christ? Who's
[37:44] cheering?
[37:45] All of heaven.
[37:52] But Satan knows that competitive nature
[37:54] and he doesn't want these guys working
[37:57] for the kingdom of God because they're
[37:59] very
[37:59] powerful. All right, next. Here comes
[38:02] another competitive
[38:04] enjoying the hunt. Yes, I'm a message
[38:08] believer. I can go hunting cuz brother
[38:10] Brennham did. Um, look all at all those
[38:14] trophies.
[38:16] There's a reason why brother Brennham
[38:17] went hunting. I'm not saying hunting is
[38:18] bad, but he had to he had a big fight, a
[38:21] struggle. So, here's all his trophies.
[38:23] And does he bring him to heaven? No,
[38:26] we're not even Oh, sorry. We're not
[38:27] going to be killing animals in here. I'm
[38:28] I'm planning on riding them, feeding
[38:31] them. Okay, but I'm a girl. But yeah,
[38:34] it's never struck me to kill an animal.
[38:36] Um, but yes, trophies. Awesome. Um, but
[38:40] they mean nothing to the Lord. They will
[38:42] burn up like everything else. Everything
[38:44] we see right here is going to burn. It's
[38:47] not going to last. Okay. Then we've got
[38:49] guys who has dedicated their life to the
[38:52] Lord. They are going out daily. They're
[38:55] reading their Bible. They're saying,
[38:56] "Hey Lord, what's this? What's this
[38:59] thing in me? How you've created me
[39:00] special? How can I use it for your
[39:04] kingdom?" They went out. They told
[39:06] people about Christ. They prayed for
[39:08] people. They used their gifts and
[39:09] talents for the Lord. And guess who
[39:12] they're going to see at the banqueting
[39:14] table with them?
[39:21] So, uh, the moral, well, not the moral,
[39:24] the end conclusion that we all came up
[39:27] with was what are we doing? What are
[39:30] where are we putting our time? Where are
[39:31] we putting our are we we're just all
[39:34] made so differently. I always thought,
[39:36] you know, like Dave, he's reminds me of
[39:38] brother Andy. I'm like, man, he's got an
[39:40] evangelistic
[39:41] um calling on his life. You know, I've
[39:44] got Noel. I only know my children
[39:46] because I live with them. You know, I
[39:48] know she's a prayer warrior. You know,
[39:49] it's like, man, Satan, lady is he in
[39:51] church. The lady is in church. It's easy
[39:54] to just sit and do nothing and just feed
[39:57] on the word and we have such a good
[39:58] life, but we it's it's the souls that
[40:01] matter, right? So um I hope this
[40:03] encourage we wanted it to be a blessing
[40:06] to you and hope it encourages all of us
[40:09] to push um that lady and church age and
[40:12] all those devils that want to make us
[40:14] fruitless and help us to remember that
[40:17] the only things that matter on this
[40:18] earth and why we're living are the souls
[40:21] that we bring.
[40:23] Okay, so that's our Sunday school
[40:24] lesson. We hope you enjoy it and we've
[40:26] got a song for you as well.
[40:29] [Applause]

[53:16] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[53:18] bless you. So, we're going to go to
[53:20] Genesis chapter 15 this morning, and
[53:23] we're going to read um from verses 1
[53:26] down to down to verse uh 10. And then
[53:30] we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 6.
[53:31] And I just want to continue on from um
[53:34] last Sunday about we're living in the
[53:37] Abrahamic age, Brother speaks about. So
[53:39] there's a people who are raised in the
[53:42] end time. Amen. To possess every
[53:44] promise. So, Amen. So, is everyone happy
[53:46] today? Is everyone good? Yep. Praise the
[53:49] Lord. Happy to be a Christian. Amen.
[53:51] Amen. So, let's uh go to Genesis 15:1.
[53:53] And after these things, the word of the
[53:55] Lord came unto Abraham in a vision,
[53:57] saying, "Fear not, Abraham. I am thy
[54:00] shield and thy exceeding great reward."
[54:02] And Abraham said unto uh said, "Lord
[54:05] God, Lord God, what will thou give? What
[54:08] will thou give me, seeing I go
[54:11] childless, and the steward of my house?
[54:13] Uh, is this Eleazar of Damascus? And
[54:14] Abraham said, Behold, to me, uh, thou
[54:18] hast given no seed, and lo, one born uh,
[54:20] in my house, no, one born in my house is
[54:23] mine ear. And behold, the word of the
[54:24] Lord came unto him, and said, This shall
[54:26] not be thine ear, but he shall come
[54:28] forth out of thine own bells shall be
[54:31] thine ear. And he and he brought him
[54:33] forth abroad and said, "Look now toward
[54:36] heaven and tell the stars if thou if
[54:38] thou be able to number them." And he
[54:40] said unto them, "So shall thy seed be."
[54:43] And he believed in the Lord. And he and
[54:46] he counted it to him for righteousness.
[54:48] And he said unto him, I am the Lord that
[54:50] brought thee out of the um out of the
[54:52] Chaldes to give thee this land to
[54:54] inherit it. And he said, Lord God,
[54:57] whereby shall I know that I shall
[54:59] inherit it? And he said unto him, "Take
[55:02] thee a hepher of three years old, and a
[55:04] shegoat of three years old, and a ram of
[55:05] three years old, and a turtle dove, and
[55:07] a young pigeon, and he took unto him all
[55:11] these, and divided them in the midst,
[55:12] and laid each one against the other. But
[55:15] the birds divided he not." So Abraham's
[55:18] asking for confirmation that this
[55:20] promise that he's going to receive it,
[55:21] and God gives him a sacrifice. So God
[55:24] confirms his word by giving a sacrifice,
[55:26] right? And then also here in Hebrews
[55:28] chapter 6, he says, "For when God made
[55:30] promise to Abraham, because he could
[55:32] swear by no greater, he swear by
[55:34] himself, saying, "Surely blessing I'll
[55:36] bless thee, and multiplying I'll
[55:38] multiply thee." And so after he had
[55:40] patiently endured, he obtained the
[55:42] promise. For men verely swear by the
[55:44] greater, and an oath for confirmation is
[55:47] to them an end of all strife, wherein
[55:49] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[55:52] the ears of um promise the immut
[55:54] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[55:56] by an oath, that by two immutable things
[56:00] in which it was impossible for God to
[56:01] lie, we might have a strong consolation
[56:04] who have fled for refuge to lay upon the
[56:07] hope set before us, which hope we have
[56:09] as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
[56:12] steadfast and which end uh and which
[56:15] enterth into within uh that within the
[56:17] veil where the the forerunner is for us
[56:20] entered even Jesus made and high priest
[56:23] forever after the order of misdc. Amen.
[56:26] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[56:27] word this morning. You may have your
[56:28] seats. So I want to speak about as I was
[56:31] speaking last Sunday about we as brother
[56:33] Bram made the statement we're living in
[56:34] this Abrahamic age where where you know
[56:37] we live in the days of Lot but we know
[56:39] in the days of Lot there was Abraham and
[56:41] Abraham received the promised son uh God
[56:43] God came and visited him changed his
[56:46] body changed Sarah's body that they
[56:48] would receive the promise that God had
[56:50] given them. Now we are the sons and
[56:52] daughters of Abraham according to faith.
[56:54] Now let's just all focus in this
[56:56] morning. Okay? Let's just all be here.
[56:57] Okay? We're here. Let's be here. Okay.
[56:59] present in body and in spirit. Okay? At
[57:01] school, you can be present in body but
[57:03] not in spirit, but be both here today.
[57:04] Okay? Amen. So, so Abraham would Abraham
[57:07] would ask God because God, you think
[57:09] about this where where it was it was
[57:12] impossible for for Abraham to to receive
[57:16] this promised son. And then God would
[57:17] ask um he would ask God, "How shall I
[57:19] know I'm going to inherit this?" And
[57:20] then God would confirm it by giving him
[57:23] this sacrifice to to to institute the
[57:25] sacrifice. And God would tell him that
[57:27] your seed and you are your seed is going
[57:30] to possess this land. And so now there
[57:32] was a promise given to him. And so when
[57:35] when um you know whenever something's
[57:38] confirmed, you can relax. E right, I'm
[57:41] just kind of jumping. But you got to
[57:42] realize, you know, when something's
[57:43] confirmed to you, you know, you get
[57:45] given a promise. But when you receive
[57:47] that promise, when it becomes alive to
[57:49] you, when it's real to you, when you
[57:51] receive it, then you can relax. It's
[57:52] like if you give a child, you promise a
[57:54] child, we're going to go buy you
[57:55] something. They're excited. They want
[57:58] it. They're all, you know, they're not
[57:59] calm, right? They're really excited.
[58:01] They want it. They keep reminding you.
[58:03] But then when it becomes the promise
[58:05] becomes more than the word becomes
[58:07] tangible. So, for example, William,
[58:09] we're going to buy you some Lego. He's
[58:12] excited. He's jumping. He wants He wants
[58:14] it, right? But then when he receives
[58:15] that, the what is that? That promise or
[58:18] that oath is confirmed to him because he
[58:19] sees that promise in his hands. Then he
[58:21] relaxes. Amen. Are you following me to
[58:24] Amen this morning? Right. So it's the
[58:26] same thing with the word. Now when the
[58:27] word becomes a revelation, then we
[58:29] actually cease from all strife. All
[58:31] worry goes. Amen. We can relax in God's
[58:33] promise because it's become a
[58:34] revelation. Amen. He confirms his
[58:36] promise. Amen. Unto us. And that is when
[58:39] and then then all strife ends. Now
[58:42] Abraham, you know, we read this here.
[58:44] You know the first verse we read it
[58:46] starts with this. And after these
[58:47] things. Okay. So what happened in the
[58:50] previous chapter is that God uh Abraham
[58:52] met Melazedc right and then and then so
[58:55] after he met Melzdc then God came down
[58:58] and confirmed the covenant by a
[59:00] sacrifice. Now God has given us a great
[59:02] sacrifice more than doves and and and
[59:05] bulls and lambs and goats and all these
[59:06] things but it was the his own blood shed
[59:08] on Calvary. Amen. So, because we asked
[59:11] the question, how we know we're going to
[59:12] get a change of the body? Well, go well,
[59:14] God told us, well, I'm going to confirm
[59:16] this by by by giving you a sacrifice.
[59:18] Amen. By by myself becoming man dying on
[59:21] Calvary now. And then when that becomes
[59:23] more than a story to us, but a living
[59:25] reality. Then really, we should cease
[59:27] from all strife. We should enter into
[59:29] rest. Amen. When you receive the baptism
[59:31] of the Holy Ghost, you're resting in the
[59:33] power of God. Amen. You're no longer
[59:36] trying to be the Christian trying to do
[59:38] right. that begins to live out of you. I
[59:40] mean, there's overcoming power in in the
[59:42] Holy Spirit. Amen. When he comes into
[59:44] your life, and that's when God confirms
[59:46] his covenant to you. Amen. Because the
[59:48] covenant was confirmed to Abraham, but
[59:50] it's got to be confirmed to you also.
[59:52] Amen. And because why? We're the sons
[59:54] and daughters of Abraham. That's why you
[59:56] can walk in this world, you can rejoice,
[59:58] you can be happy because God has
[1:00:00] confirmed his promise to you. Amen. And
[1:00:02] when he confirms it to you, you know
[1:00:04] it's going to come to pass. You just got
[1:00:06] to water that promise with praise. Amen.
[1:00:09] That's why praise ye the Lord, oh my
[1:00:11] soul. Amen. It's so important that we
[1:00:13] walk because Abraham, I believe his
[1:00:15] walk, you know, sure, he had struggles
[1:00:17] and trials, but he had a joy in his
[1:00:20] walk. Amen. He had a praise in his walk
[1:00:23] because he knew God was more than able
[1:00:25] to do it. And when it became a
[1:00:27] revelation to him, he just rejoiced in
[1:00:29] the fact, Lord, your promise is going to
[1:00:31] happen. Amen. He wasn't worry. Uh he
[1:00:34] wasn't guessing maybe he'll have the son
[1:00:36] and how's it all going to happen. He
[1:00:38] knew God was going to do it. Amen. So
[1:00:41] this one that that that that Abraham met
[1:00:44] was Malazdc. Now we know that Malazdc,
[1:00:47] he was the king of Salem. Amen. He was
[1:00:49] the priest of the most high God. So this
[1:00:51] word Salem means actually a complete
[1:00:54] peace. Amen. So So here's the king of
[1:00:56] peace coming to his coming to his
[1:00:59] subject, coming to his friend. Amen.
[1:01:01] Abraham came under the influence of the
[1:01:03] king of peace. Amen. So it's no longer
[1:01:06] him striving and worrying and up and
[1:01:07] down and things. No, the peace of God
[1:01:10] reigned in his heart. Amen. So now if
[1:01:12] you move from peace into trouble and
[1:01:14] worry and stress, you can be in a trial
[1:01:16] but have perfect peace. Amen. Paul was
[1:01:18] in a lot of trials, but he had perfect
[1:01:20] peace. Amen. Why? Because he met Mazdc.
[1:01:23] He met the king of the city. Amen. So
[1:01:25] sure, he was stoned, beaten, run from
[1:01:27] places, in hardship, all kinds of
[1:01:29] things. But yet the peace of God ruled
[1:01:31] in his heart. Amen. Why? Cuz he was
[1:01:33] under the influence of Mazdc. Amen. The
[1:01:36] king of peace. Hallelujah. And it's the
[1:01:38] same thing with you and I friends. If
[1:01:39] you have moved from peace into trouble
[1:01:41] and worry and all you see is the
[1:01:43] hardship and the problems and you're
[1:01:45] stressing and you're all tense, I'll
[1:01:47] tell you something else is trying to
[1:01:48] have dominion over your life. Amen. And
[1:01:50] you got to push that thing back in the
[1:01:52] name of Jesus Christ. You got to
[1:01:53] realize, no, that is not my king. Amen.
[1:01:56] Influencing my life. That's the enemy
[1:01:58] trying to drag me down where God wants
[1:01:59] to lift me up and stabilize my walk and
[1:02:02] give me a piece that passes all
[1:02:03] understanding. You got to realize when
[1:02:05] the enemy tries to buffet you, he
[1:02:07] doesn't come with horns and a you know,
[1:02:09] you know, a a big fork and all those
[1:02:11] things. He comes suddenly trying to
[1:02:13] change your thinking, trying to get you
[1:02:15] to think like him. Well, you know, you
[1:02:17] know, trouble comes, you say, and you
[1:02:18] know, the devil says, "Well, it'll
[1:02:19] always be this way." And you know, I
[1:02:21] have a right to be angry. I've got a
[1:02:23] right to be tense. I've got a right to
[1:02:24] be grump because all these situations of
[1:02:26] life, that's not the king of peace
[1:02:28] ruling. Amen. That's the enemy trying to
[1:02:31] rule you. So, you got to identify him
[1:02:33] and say, "Satan, get behind me in the
[1:02:35] name of Jesus Christ." Amen. Cuz there's
[1:02:37] always going to be a battle over your
[1:02:38] soul. But you got to realize the Lord
[1:02:40] has won the battle. Amen. So, he he's
[1:02:42] confirmed his covenant with you. I'll
[1:02:44] never leave you nor forsake you. I'm
[1:02:46] going to take you in a rapture. Amen.
[1:02:48] You are my child. I cannot lose you. And
[1:02:50] when he confirms it by giving you the
[1:02:52] Holy Ghost, then you can rest.
[1:02:55] Amen. We should be resting in this hour.
[1:02:58] You say, "There's so much trouble on
[1:02:59] every hand, but we should be resting."
[1:03:02] You say, "But the world's falling apart,
[1:03:03] but we should be resting cuz God wants
[1:03:06] to prove his word."
[1:03:09] Amen. God wants to prove his word. Yeah,
[1:03:11] this is um I just want to find this here
[1:03:14] if I can. He says the Bible said Abraham
[1:03:17] staggered not the at the promise of God
[1:03:19] through unbelief was strong giving
[1:03:21] praise to God. There's such a powerful
[1:03:24] secret in that. Maybe we'll go into it
[1:03:25] later. But you got to praise the Lord
[1:03:27] when I feel it, when I don't, when I'm
[1:03:30] up, when I'm down. That's irrelevant.
[1:03:32] The promises of God are not based on
[1:03:33] your emotional state. No, the promise of
[1:03:36] God to you is based on revelation. And
[1:03:38] it's far deeper than how you're feeling.
[1:03:40] You can feel down in the dumps, but
[1:03:41] praise ye the Lord. You say, "Well, you
[1:03:43] the devil come to you say you're a
[1:03:44] hypocrite by praising God when you feel
[1:03:46] down." No, you're not. Because your soul
[1:03:48] is sealed to the day of your redemption.
[1:03:50] You know in whom you have believed and
[1:03:52] that salvation is not based on how you
[1:03:54] feel. Amen. You could be having the
[1:03:56] worst time of your life. Praise ye the
[1:03:58] Lord. Amen. Give him glory. Amen.
[1:04:00] Hallelujah. I'm so glad he's my God
[1:04:02] today. Hallelujah. See, this is why we
[1:04:05] shouldn't we should not worship God or
[1:04:07] act you be a Christian based on how we
[1:04:09] feel. One day you feel saved, one fa one
[1:04:12] day you don't. Does that change your
[1:04:13] salvation?
[1:04:15] No. One day you feel like you're rapture
[1:04:17] ready. One day you think, "How on earth
[1:04:18] am I going to get there?" Does that
[1:04:20] change the fact you're going?
[1:04:22] Then why do we walk according to how we
[1:04:24] feel? Oh, but my emotions are real.
[1:04:27] Yeah, they are real. But what is re
[1:04:30] realer if that's a word? Is a revelation
[1:04:33] or feelings?
[1:04:35] I think Abraham walked by revelation.
[1:04:38] That's why he staggered not at the
[1:04:39] promise of God cuz he knew God was able
[1:04:41] to do it. Amen. Have you become fully
[1:04:43] persuaded God is able to do it in your
[1:04:45] circumstance. Amen. Because if you got
[1:04:48] the faith of Abraham, you'll be fully
[1:04:50] persuaded. God, you're more than able to
[1:04:52] do it. Whatever I'm facing right now,
[1:04:54] God, you're more than able. You're more
[1:04:56] than enough. The devil ain't enough.
[1:04:58] He's not able. Amen. God is more than
[1:05:00] able. Amen. That's why be strong giving
[1:05:02] praise to God. His name was changed from
[1:05:04] Abraham to Abraham. changing of the name
[1:05:07] made his name father of nations. Could
[1:05:08] you imagine a man living with his wife,
[1:05:11] his sweetheart that he had lived with
[1:05:12] her now all these years now somewhere in
[1:05:15] the age of 80 years old, his wife 70
[1:05:18] years old and yet without one child or
[1:05:20] any hope of child yet claimed that he
[1:05:22] was a father of nations. Could you
[1:05:23] imagine the criticism of his of his
[1:05:25] passing fellow man would say father of
[1:05:28] nations? Oh now how many children have
[1:05:31] you at this time? and all the criticism
[1:05:33] he had to go um he had to go through
[1:05:36] with. But Abraham didn't stagger
[1:05:39] anywhere at all of unbelief, he believed
[1:05:41] that God was able to perform that which
[1:05:43] he had promised that God would prove his
[1:05:46] word no matter how long it took. But
[1:05:49] instead of getting weaker each time like
[1:05:51] we prone to do, he got stronger all the
[1:05:53] time. If it didn't happen today,
[1:05:55] tomorrow will be a greater miracle cuz
[1:05:57] it's one day older. That was God. That
[1:06:00] was God in Abraham. know that God proved
[1:06:03] all of his words to do so. If his
[1:06:05] children will only take his word so he
[1:06:07] can prove it by you. Amen. That's the
[1:06:10] only way he can prove his word. He
[1:06:12] doesn't prove it to uh to unbelievers.
[1:06:15] It can't they can't be proved. They're
[1:06:16] unbelievers. But it's not to the
[1:06:18] unbelievers. It's not for unbelievers.
[1:06:20] It's to him that believe. If he can find
[1:06:24] somebody who will believe his word, he
[1:06:26] will prove his word by you. And
[1:06:28] sometimes sickness and things happen to
[1:06:30] us that way. that God can prove himself.
[1:06:34] Amen. So, you got to realize that God
[1:06:36] wants to prove his word. It's easy to
[1:06:38] talk about Abraham. It's easy to talk
[1:06:40] about Caleb. We'll probably get to him
[1:06:42] in different ones, but he wants to prove
[1:06:44] it by your life. He wants to prove it
[1:06:46] through your faith. Amen. That's what
[1:06:48] God wants to do. He wants to prove his
[1:06:50] word that it works in 2025.
[1:06:54] Amen. God wants to use you. That's why
[1:06:56] when trouble comes in, sickness,
[1:06:58] whatever happens, you got to realize,
[1:06:59] God, you've allowed this cuz you want to
[1:07:01] prove your word in me. Amen. So, what do
[1:07:05] we do now? We be like Abraham. We don't
[1:07:07] look at symptoms or signs or, you know,
[1:07:09] trouble or whatever. No, we just look
[1:07:11] purely at his word, at his ability. We
[1:07:14] focus on that and let and just carry it
[1:07:16] in your heart. That's why it's so
[1:07:19] important. Take all the promises of God
[1:07:21] and accumulate them in your heart and
[1:07:23] walk with those. Amen. have fellowship
[1:07:25] with those like um Christine was talking
[1:07:27] to one of her brothers the other day and
[1:07:29] you know he was all down in the dumps
[1:07:31] and things and you know he's seeking the
[1:07:32] Holy Ghost and you know getting annoyed
[1:07:34] at God then she asked him the question
[1:07:36] you know you know what happened you know
[1:07:38] you know when when you saw the stars and
[1:07:40] all these things happened that was God
[1:07:42] and what about the drugs who you know
[1:07:43] God took them out of his life and you
[1:07:45] know the testimonies of what God had
[1:07:48] already done in his life begin to become
[1:07:49] alive again what faith was rising. Amen.
[1:07:52] And he realized, well, and she said,
[1:07:54] "Well, if God did that for you, the Holy
[1:07:55] Ghost is the same. The same faith will
[1:07:57] get the same, you know, we'll get that
[1:07:58] promise." He's like, "That's right."
[1:08:00] Amen. So, so, so what happened? He began
[1:08:02] to praise the Lord being happy because
[1:08:04] he realized what God has already done,
[1:08:06] he's going to continue doing. Amen. So,
[1:08:09] so why do we, you know, it's like God
[1:08:11] told Abraham here in the beginning. He
[1:08:13] says, "I took you out of the land of the
[1:08:15] earth of the Chaldes." So, he's saying,
[1:08:17] "Look, I've taken you out of there. I'm
[1:08:19] going to fulfill this part also." Amen.
[1:08:21] So, so we must never forget where God
[1:08:23] has taken us out of. Amen. Out of
[1:08:25] depression, out of the world, out of
[1:08:27] drugs, out of trouble, out of religion,
[1:08:29] out of unbelief, whatever it was, out of
[1:08:31] just a lukewarm spirit. God's taken us
[1:08:33] out of that. And if he's brought us out,
[1:08:35] he's going to take us in. Amen. He's
[1:08:37] proved that part of his word. He wants
[1:08:38] to prove all of his words in our lives.
[1:08:43] Praise the Lord. I'm so thankful for
[1:08:44] that. Amen. But you see, Abraham,
[1:08:47] Abraham was strong giving praise to the
[1:08:49] Lord. Now, we got to realize that that
[1:08:52] as Nehemiah told the people of Israel,
[1:08:54] the joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1:08:56] This is this is so important in this day
[1:08:58] as as sister Shannon was saying,
[1:09:00] everything's hate, hate, negative, hate,
[1:09:02] hate. But we need to preach love. We
[1:09:04] need to have a life of the love of God
[1:09:06] around us to build each other up. Amen.
[1:09:08] So, it's only the positive that will
[1:09:10] that will give you strength, right?
[1:09:13] Looking at your circumstances never
[1:09:14] gives anyone strength. Brother Ram said,
[1:09:16] "Worry never helped or delivered a
[1:09:18] single soul upon the planet, but faith
[1:09:21] can deliver." Amen. He said, "Well, what
[1:09:22] if you're getting shot in the morning?"
[1:09:23] Well, faith could deliver me. Amen.
[1:09:26] Faith could deliver. Amen. So, even in
[1:09:28] impossible circumstances, faith could
[1:09:30] deliver. How did Peter get out of the
[1:09:32] jail? He was in the inner prison. He had
[1:09:34] all those soldiers around him and in the
[1:09:36] morning he was going to get executed.
[1:09:37] What brought him out of the jail? The
[1:09:39] faith of the believer. Amen. The faith
[1:09:41] of the believer touched heaven. God sent
[1:09:43] his angel. Brought brought Peter out.
[1:09:45] Why? because faith moved him out of that
[1:09:47] prison. Amen. So I think we should look
[1:09:49] at that, you know, look at our
[1:09:50] circumstances the same way. Faith can
[1:09:53] deliver. Faith does deliver. Amen.
[1:09:55] That's why we should realize that, you
[1:09:57] know, the joy of the Lord is our
[1:09:59] strength. Amen. It's not a See, see,
[1:10:01] negativity is weakness. Amen. But if we
[1:10:04] have a joy of the Lord, Lord, you're so
[1:10:06] great. Lord, you're so awesome. In this
[1:10:08] trial, you're the same. Amen. Lord,
[1:10:10] you've never left me. You've never
[1:10:11] forsaken me. Lord, you've always been on
[1:10:13] time. Lord, you've always come through,
[1:10:15] Lord Jesus. Lord, you're so good to me.
[1:10:17] Thank you for purchasing my salvation.
[1:10:19] Well, it builds a joy and it gives you a
[1:10:22] strength in the battle.
[1:10:25] Hallelujah. That's why we must always
[1:10:28] never let our testimony become negative.
[1:10:31] See, David would say, "Lord, restore the
[1:10:33] joy of thy salvation." Amen. Brother Ram
[1:10:36] said, you know, like someone who
[1:10:37] backslides, really what backsliding is
[1:10:39] is they just get out of fellowship with
[1:10:40] God. They ain't lost. They just get out
[1:10:42] of fellowship with God. I say David got
[1:10:45] out of fellowship with God when he took
[1:10:46] Bashibba. But you know when you know
[1:10:48] when it was exposed and he came back to
[1:10:50] God, he says, "Lord, restore the joy of
[1:10:52] thy salvation."
[1:10:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. Joy, the joy of
[1:10:58] the Lord is your strength. Amen. But you
[1:11:00] see now Abraham Abraham was promised the
[1:11:03] land, but he didn't receive the land,
[1:11:07] right? He walked up and down it. He was
[1:11:09] shown every part of it, but it was for
[1:11:12] his children to dwell
[1:11:14] there. Amen. And it's the same thing if
[1:11:16] you look at all the promises of God. You
[1:11:18] look down through. So I'm just trying to
[1:11:19] find here in Hebrews chapter 11, it says
[1:11:22] here now these all died in faith.
[1:11:23] There's all the heroes of faith. Having
[1:11:25] not received the promises, but having
[1:11:26] seen them a far off were persuaded of
[1:11:28] them and embraced them and confessed
[1:11:31] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:11:33] earth. So So God showed Abraham, "Your
[1:11:36] seed's going to dwell here." He showed
[1:11:37] them the promise. this is their land and
[1:11:39] and he saw it a far off. He wasn't going
[1:11:42] to see his seed possess it, but he
[1:11:44] embraced that promise, you know. And how
[1:11:46] many promises of the Bible have been
[1:11:48] left for this time? Amen. That that even
[1:11:51] the early church, they did not receive
[1:11:53] the promises that we have. Amen. You I
[1:11:55] often think of John the Revelator, you
[1:11:57] know, he's about to write what the seals
[1:11:58] are, and God says, "Seal them up." You
[1:12:01] know, so he saw it, but he couldn't
[1:12:02] speak of it. He couldn't write it down.
[1:12:04] He said that's for the end time when the
[1:12:06] seventh angel will sound and the
[1:12:07] mysteries of God would be finished. You
[1:12:09] know when when um the apostle Paul would
[1:12:11] speak about the rapture and he'd speak
[1:12:13] they which are alive and remain to the
[1:12:15] Thessalonians I believe they would have
[1:12:17] read that the Thessalonians would have
[1:12:18] read that say we are going to be the
[1:12:19] alive and remain group right but the
[1:12:22] promise they embraced the promise but
[1:12:24] the promise was for 2,000 years down the
[1:12:27] road for this day. Amen. For you know
[1:12:29] when the apostle Paul wrote that we not
[1:12:31] all we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:12:33] be changed in a moment twinkling of an
[1:12:35] eye to those who read that it would have
[1:12:37] been this is my promise and they are a
[1:12:40] part of the promise but they had to
[1:12:41] they're the ones that die in Christ
[1:12:43] right but those which are alive and
[1:12:45] remain that is our promise
[1:12:48] amen so every promise of the Bible many
[1:12:50] of them were seen a far off and embraced
[1:12:52] like we read there in the scripture but
[1:12:54] they are all for today amen so it's not
[1:12:57] just to see them a far off. We don't see
[1:12:59] the promises a far off like in the
[1:13:01] future sometime. Therefore, now if
[1:13:03] that's all you get out of this service,
[1:13:04] here's my summary. Every promise is
[1:13:06] yours. Go take it. Don't let nothing
[1:13:09] stop it. Amen. Don't let no enemy stop
[1:13:11] you. That's my summary. Okay? Every
[1:13:13] divine promise is yours today. Amen. So,
[1:13:16] so now you know Abraham would walk up
[1:13:18] and down the land. He'd see the land,
[1:13:20] but he never he never possessed it like
[1:13:23] his children would. So now 400 years
[1:13:26] down the road now, God was going to
[1:13:28] bring the seed of Abraham back into the
[1:13:30] promised land. I say it's the same thing
[1:13:32] like the early church. They walked up
[1:13:34] and down the promises. But it came seven
[1:13:36] church ages later where the where the
[1:13:38] where the where the children of the
[1:13:40] faith will come back in into the
[1:13:42] promised land, back into the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:44] and they would possess every part of it.
[1:13:47] That's you and I. God wants to prove his
[1:13:49] word that there'll be a people upon the
[1:13:50] earth that every divine promise of God,
[1:13:52] they possess it. Amen. There's no
[1:13:55] squatters on their land. Amen. There's
[1:13:57] no enemies telling them they can't have
[1:13:58] it no more. Amen. No, they drive every
[1:14:01] enemy off and they possess every divine
[1:14:03] promise. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:07] Amen. It says here in Hebrews 11 39 and
[1:14:10] 40, and all these having retained a good
[1:14:12] report through faith, received not the
[1:14:13] promise, God having provided some better
[1:14:16] thing for us that they without us should
[1:14:18] not be made perfect. Amen. So, so they
[1:14:22] didn't receive the promise, but we're
[1:14:23] here to receive every promise. This is
[1:14:25] the hour we live. Amen. If they live
[1:14:27] this time, they would receive the
[1:14:28] promise, right? So, it's just God places
[1:14:30] in this age. Amen. To receive every
[1:14:33] promise that they saw. Now, God would
[1:14:35] God would speak to Abraham and he'd say,
[1:14:38] "So, if I just find this here, see
[1:14:41] now, let's just, sorry, I'm just trying
[1:14:44] to find where I'm up
[1:14:45] to." Amen. Let's just read this here
[1:14:47] from Jehovah Gyra. He says, "Your
[1:14:49] children of God, come back to your
[1:14:50] covenant. Come back into the promised
[1:14:52] land." What is the promise? Peter said,
[1:14:54] "On the day of Pentecost, the promise is
[1:14:55] unto you and to your children and to
[1:14:57] them that are far off, even as many as
[1:14:58] the Lord our God shall call." The
[1:15:00] promises to them, "Yes, sir." Now, we
[1:15:01] find out when Abraham separated himself,
[1:15:04] God came to him and said,"Abraham, all
[1:15:05] this is yours." Now, he never had said
[1:15:08] that uh before that. But you see, he
[1:15:10] still he was still tied down with his
[1:15:12] hanging on little thread here, too many
[1:15:14] loose ends. He had a lot of he had Lot
[1:15:16] still with him and all the fuss and so
[1:15:18] forth. So when he separated himself, got
[1:15:20] really where God told him to Abraham,
[1:15:22] then God appeared to him and said, "Now
[1:15:24] Abraham, get up and walk through the
[1:15:26] land. Look at it. It's all yours. I give
[1:15:28] you divine healing. I give you
[1:15:30] salvation. I give you the baptism of the
[1:15:31] Holy Ghost. I give you all these
[1:15:33] promises. Every one of them is yours,
[1:15:34] Abraham. Look through them. See what you
[1:15:37] all you got. See, just see what's yours.
[1:15:40] Then they're all yours, Abraham." Amen.
[1:15:44] I can see father Abraham looking, just
[1:15:46] looking, saying, "Praise God, I own that
[1:15:48] mountain. I own this mountain. I own
[1:15:50] that. I own this. I own that. It's all
[1:15:52] mine." Amen. That's the way it is.
[1:15:53] Everything in the Bible belongs to me.
[1:15:55] I'm Abraham's son. I'm Abraham's seed.
[1:15:57] Amen. You're Abraham's seed. See, he
[1:16:00] walked up and down the land seeing
[1:16:01] everything that was his, but his future
[1:16:02] generation came in and possessed it. And
[1:16:04] I think it's very important in this day
[1:16:06] we look at what is ours, not what the
[1:16:09] devil says is ours. What God says is
[1:16:11] ours. Amen. Because when when the Lord
[1:16:13] opened the book of redemption, the title
[1:16:16] deed of redemption, he was revealing our
[1:16:18] inheritance. Amen. It was more it's more
[1:16:21] than horse riders and saying it's it's
[1:16:22] the revelation contained in the seven
[1:16:24] seals. Amen. Is our inheritance. It's
[1:16:27] our right. It's our birthright. Amen.
[1:16:29] It's what Christ died that we would fall
[1:16:31] air to. Amen. So in that within the
[1:16:34] seals is overcoming power. I mean within
[1:16:36] the seals is the power to break cycles.
[1:16:39] Amen. To break generational curses.
[1:16:41] Amen. To break problems that have been
[1:16:43] petting for years and generations and
[1:16:46] tempers and fussing and fighting and
[1:16:47] indifference and all these things. It's
[1:16:49] here to be broken. Amen. Where maybe a
[1:16:52] depressive spirits been down through
[1:16:53] your family line. It's got to be broken.
[1:16:55] Amen. Amen. Maybe there's a temper or
[1:16:58] high passion or adulterous spirit.
[1:17:00] Whatever it is. Amen. God is here to
[1:17:02] break those things. Amen. There's a
[1:17:04] power in this word to break everything
[1:17:06] that is not of God. We're going to
[1:17:07] realize God's given it to you by his
[1:17:10] grace that's here for you to possess.
[1:17:12] Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] Amen. And I tell you what, friends, it's
[1:17:16] nothing we earn.
[1:17:20] Amen. Okay. I I You know what I like
[1:17:24] about it? The fact that we don't earn
[1:17:25] it, then that means I can receive it.
[1:17:28] Amen. I can possess it. I can enjoy it
[1:17:29] because I didn't earn it. Because if I
[1:17:31] try and earn it, I won't be able to earn
[1:17:32] it. Amen. And that's how God made his
[1:17:34] program. Amen. He says this now. He says
[1:17:37] this in the lady and church age and this
[1:17:39] is speaking of wait let's just go back
[1:17:41] here he's speaking now let us examine
[1:17:42] this phrase as many as I love. In the
[1:17:45] Greek the emphasis uh is upon the
[1:17:47] personal pronoun I. He does not say as
[1:17:50] many as would feel he should say as many
[1:17:52] as love me. No sir we must never try to
[1:17:56] make Jesus the object of human love in
[1:17:58] this verse which is from Revelations 3.
[1:18:00] As many as I love I rebuke and chasen.
[1:18:01] Right? This is what he's talking about.
[1:18:03] Okay. Now he says, "No, it is the many
[1:18:06] that are that that are the loved ones of
[1:18:08] God. It is his love in question, not
[1:18:10] ours." So once again, we find ourselves
[1:18:12] glorifying in his salvation, his
[1:18:14] purpose, and his plan. And we are
[1:18:16] confirmed even more strongly in the
[1:18:18] truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty
[1:18:19] of God. Now, as he said in Romans 9:13,
[1:18:22] Jacob have I loved. Does it now obtain
[1:18:25] that since he loved only the many, is he
[1:18:28] therefore in a state of complacency,
[1:18:30] awaiting the love of those who have not
[1:18:32] um um who have not drawn nigh him? By no
[1:18:36] means is this so for he declared also in
[1:18:39] Romans 9:13, "Esau have I hated." And in
[1:18:42] verse 11, the spirit boldly calls out,
[1:18:44] "For the children not being born,
[1:18:45] neither having done any good or evil,
[1:18:48] that the purpose of God according to
[1:18:49] election might stand, not of works, but
[1:18:52] of him that calleth." This love is
[1:18:54] elective love. It is his love for his
[1:18:56] elect, and his love for them is apart
[1:18:58] from human merit. Yes. So you don't earn
[1:19:02] this. Amen. We need to get this. See
[1:19:04] this is the problem of the overlap of a
[1:19:06] previous age of Pentecostal influence
[1:19:07] coming to the messages a legalism of
[1:19:10] earning something. Brother Am said they
[1:19:12] were good legalists. They tried to earn
[1:19:14] their way into heaven by speaking in
[1:19:15] tongues or some sign or some miracle.
[1:19:17] But every promise of God is without
[1:19:20] human merit. Amen. The grace of God is
[1:19:22] God. It's it's his unmmerited favor
[1:19:26] comes upon your life. And why does it
[1:19:28] come upon your life? Because you're one
[1:19:29] of his children.
[1:19:32] Amen. So this is all apart from human
[1:19:34] merit. And I rejoice in this because it
[1:19:36] means as I said before that it's mine. I
[1:19:38] don't need to earn it. I don't need to
[1:19:40] strive for it. He's freely given it.
[1:19:42] Therefore, I can receive it. Amen. It's
[1:19:44] not I'm not even in the picture. It's
[1:19:45] what he has done is in the picture. Just
[1:19:47] like Abraham wasn't in the picture when
[1:19:49] it came to him receiving the promised
[1:19:51] son. God said, "I'm going to confirm
[1:19:52] this to you by a sacrifice. And the
[1:19:55] power of that sacrifice is going to come
[1:19:56] into your life. Change your body. You're
[1:19:58] going to have the promised son." Amen.
[1:20:00] Now, that was under the blood of bulls
[1:20:01] and goats. Now, how much will those
[1:20:03] under the blood of Jesus Christ, Amen,
[1:20:05] where God would confirm his covenant,
[1:20:07] Amen, in our lives by giving us the
[1:20:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost? Amen. I hope
[1:20:12] we're not having art class in the front
[1:20:13] row right here. We Okay, you with me?
[1:20:15] Amen. Now, you see, you see a lot from
[1:20:17] up here. But it's apart from human
[1:20:20] merit. Amen. That means I can receive
[1:20:23] it.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah. Amen. This is why he would
[1:20:27] say here, if I can find this in um first
[1:20:30] 1 Corinthians 2, he says now he says
[1:20:33] this. He says, "Now now we have received
[1:20:35] not the spirit of the world but the
[1:20:37] spirit which is of God that we might
[1:20:39] know the things that are freely given to
[1:20:41] us of God." So it's been freely given to
[1:20:43] us. Amen. So that therefore we can
[1:20:45] freely receive it. Amen. And the only
[1:20:48] thing stopping us receiving it is the
[1:20:49] enemy. That's all it is. Amen. It's not
[1:20:52] you. It's not God. And it's the enemy
[1:20:54] trying to get between you and the
[1:20:55] promise. Amen. So therefore, we've got
[1:20:57] to we got to realize everything that the
[1:21:00] enemy tries to keep us from, we got to
[1:21:02] get it. Amen. Never ever put up for
[1:21:05] second place in terms of, well, I guess
[1:21:08] I've just I I I'm just a complex
[1:21:10] individual and this is why I can't have
[1:21:12] joy and this is why I can't be me and
[1:21:14] this is why I can't be free. That's an
[1:21:16] enemy telling you lies, preaching to you
[1:21:19] a lie that this is where you belong. No,
[1:21:21] no, you belong. rejoicing, happy. Amen.
[1:21:24] God wants us to be happy, happy in the
[1:21:27] Lord. He wants us to be rejoicing. He
[1:21:29] wants us to be at peace. He doesn't want
[1:21:31] us to be all troubled and stressed and,
[1:21:33] you know, because being sincere is not
[1:21:35] being grumpy and all bound up. That's
[1:21:38] not sincerity. That's just being grumpy
[1:21:40] and bound up. Being sincere is a genuine
[1:21:43] Lord, I love you. You're everything to
[1:21:45] me. I want you to live, Lord. Express
[1:21:48] yourself how you want through my life.
[1:21:50] Your word is true. That's a sincerity.
[1:21:52] But all the twisted up and grumpy and
[1:21:54] all you know all this. No, that's see
[1:21:56] that's the devil bringing false
[1:21:57] humility.
[1:22:00] We ain't ordained to have a false
[1:22:01] humility and we ain't ordained to be
[1:22:03] grumpy and tense and highrung and all
[1:22:05] these things. No. Well, you say, "Well,
[1:22:06] it's my personality." Don't let the
[1:22:09] devil lie to you. Some of us are more
[1:22:12] dogmatic. Some of us are more
[1:22:13] flaggmatic, all these things. But don't
[1:22:15] let Well, I'm just made this way. You
[1:22:17] know, like Lady Gaga singing you, I was
[1:22:19] born this way. Yeah, I hear people sing
[1:22:21] that at work. I'm thinking, why are you
[1:22:23] singing? Why are you owning that? I'm
[1:22:25] glad I wasn't born. I Well, my first
[1:22:29] birth is not my not my identification.
[1:22:32] Amen. My first birth doesn't make me who
[1:22:34] I am. Praise God. I'm glad I'm not that
[1:22:37] guy anymore. Hallelujah. I'm so thankful
[1:22:39] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:22:42] transforms that seed in your life.
[1:22:43] Brings it to expression. Amen. God shows
[1:22:46] you you're a son of God. That means you
[1:22:48] behave like me, you act like me, you
[1:22:50] think like me because why? You are me.
[1:22:52] Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] You're an extension of me. Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] Say, well, if it's without human merit,
[1:22:59] you I was thinking of this here. I was
[1:23:00] thinking of m uh
[1:23:02] Mphibicheth. Glory. I just love the
[1:23:05] skit. You know, it was his first birth.
[1:23:08] It was the grace of David that brought
[1:23:11] him to the table. Amen. that David would
[1:23:14] confirm the covenant he made with
[1:23:16] Jonathan. He would confirm his oath by
[1:23:19] bringing bringing his looking after the
[1:23:22] descendants of Jonathan. Like Jesus
[1:23:24] would, you know, God said to Abraham,
[1:23:26] I'm going to confirm my promise by
[1:23:28] bringing it to pass. And the Lord Jesus
[1:23:30] said to us, I'm going to confirm my
[1:23:32] promise by bringing it to pass in you.
[1:23:34] Amen. A spotless bride made in the image
[1:23:37] of his word. Hallelujah. Victorious
[1:23:39] overcoming. I'm going to confirm that in
[1:23:40] your life. Amen. So God would God would
[1:23:43] move on David in a certain season. Amen.
[1:23:47] Mphibicheth was forgotten about for a
[1:23:49] while, but he wasn't forgotten about
[1:23:51] forever. Amen. You may feel forgotten
[1:23:53] about, but you won't be forgotten
[1:23:54] forever. I know. I believe God is here.
[1:23:56] Amen. To awaken you, to make you realize
[1:23:58] you're not forgotten. You're not
[1:24:00] destitute. You're not down in Lola Labar
[1:24:02] no more. But you've been carried to the
[1:24:04] table. Hallelujah. And you think about
[1:24:06] it. Mphibicheth's first birth
[1:24:09] disqualified him from the table.
[1:24:11] Actually disqualified him from even
[1:24:13] being alive cuz he was the rightful heir
[1:24:16] to the throne of Israel. He was a
[1:24:18] descendant of King Saul. Amen. But you
[1:24:20] see, so his first birth disqualified him
[1:24:23] from the table. His first birth made him
[1:24:25] an enemy of of David. Just like our
[1:24:28] first birth made us an enemy of God.
[1:24:30] Disqualified us from every promise of
[1:24:32] God. But we don't stay in that
[1:24:34] condition. Amen. Why? Cuz the grace of
[1:24:37] God like the grace of David overrode A
[1:24:40] Mphibicheth's first birth. And he says,
[1:24:42] "Are there any descendants of Jonathan
[1:24:44] alive?" Hallelujah. The grace of There
[1:24:46] was a There was a pull. There was a pull
[1:24:49] of the grace of David to pull
[1:24:51] Mphibicheth to the table. Amen. So, here
[1:24:54] comes Mphibicheth thinking he's going to
[1:24:56] die, thinking he's going to be executed
[1:24:58] in the palace or whatever more. But
[1:24:59] David's not interested in killing him.
[1:25:02] Amen. David's interested in restoring
[1:25:05] him, restoring his lands, restoring his
[1:25:07] possession. Amen. Restoring us back to
[1:25:09] what we should have had in the
[1:25:10] beginning. Hallelujah. Why? Cuz we come
[1:25:12] in crippled, you know. Hallelujah.
[1:25:14] That's why I love, you know, Jesus told
[1:25:16] the parable of the invitation to the
[1:25:18] wedding feast. I'm one of the hope blind
[1:25:22] lame blind. I'm from that category of
[1:25:25] people. Go get them. Amen. God
[1:25:27] instructed his angels, go get those
[1:25:29] ones. get there crippled. Mphibicheth
[1:25:32] couldn't necessarily walk the distance
[1:25:33] to get to the table. So, he would have
[1:25:35] been carried put in a carriage. Amen. We
[1:25:37] were carried to the table of the Lord.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. We couldn't get there
[1:25:40] ourselves. I was lame. I was spiritually
[1:25:42] crippled. I was spiritually blind. I
[1:25:44] couldn't find the way to the to to my
[1:25:46] seat. Amen. But God sent a message. God
[1:25:50] sent a word. Amen. To carry me to his
[1:25:52] table. Hallelujah. Amen. And you know
[1:25:55] what I love about Mphibicheth sitting at
[1:25:57] the table? He comes in. The mighty men
[1:26:00] are sitting there. Hallelujah. God's
[1:26:02] great heroes of faith are sitting there.
[1:26:04] God's anointed son's at the table. And
[1:26:06] when Mphibius sits down behind the
[1:26:08] table, he looks like the mighty men.
[1:26:11] Amen. He looks like the
[1:26:13] son. Hallelujah. They all look the same
[1:26:17] way cuz the tablecloth of David's God's
[1:26:19] grace covered his crippled places.
[1:26:23] Amen. Amen. So he got there without
[1:26:26] human merit. It was because of a promise
[1:26:30] David made to Jonathan. And it's not
[1:26:33] human merit we sit at the table of the
[1:26:35] Lord. Even in this day, brother Ram said
[1:26:37] that we've been called to a feast of the
[1:26:40] word. The Pentecostals turned it down.
[1:26:42] But that's why God got went and got the
[1:26:43] cripples and the lame and the halt and
[1:26:45] the blind to sit at his table and feast
[1:26:47] on the word. Hallelujah. Amen. Like you
[1:26:51] know you know John the Baptist said God
[1:26:52] is able to raise these stones sons and
[1:26:54] daughters of Abraham. Brother said God's
[1:26:57] able to get alrats and drunkards and
[1:26:58] prostitutes and all kind of manner of
[1:27:00] people and make them into sons and
[1:27:02] daughters of Abraham. Praise God. Amen.
[1:27:04] He was talking about me when he said
[1:27:06] that. Hallelujah. God had me on me me on
[1:27:09] his mind. Hallelujah. So Mphibicheth got
[1:27:12] there without uh it was it was not his
[1:27:15] human merit. Amen. God restored him. Put
[1:27:17] him back in that table. Glory. just like
[1:27:20] us. Now, Abraham was told that his seed
[1:27:23] was going to possess this land here.
[1:27:26] Amen. Then finally, it came 400 years
[1:27:28] down the 400 years down the road. Let's
[1:27:31] just let's just read this. Actually, I
[1:27:32] just want to read this. I like these
[1:27:35] scriptures. What shall we say then? Is
[1:27:37] there unrighteousness with God? God
[1:27:39] forbid. For he saith to Moses, I'll have
[1:27:40] mercy on whom I'll have mercy. I'll have
[1:27:42] compassion on whom I'll have compassion.
[1:27:44] See, it's not him that wleth or him that
[1:27:45] runth, but God that showeth mercy.
[1:27:48] That's why when we come to God, we don't
[1:27:50] come entitled. Well, I deserve a place
[1:27:52] at the table. No. Lord, is there a place
[1:27:54] at the table for me? And that kind of
[1:27:56] attitude shows there's a place at the
[1:27:57] table for you. Lord, is there salvation
[1:27:59] for me, Lord? Lord, can you wash my sins
[1:28:01] away? Lord, is there blood for me?
[1:28:03] Hallelujah. And and then God gives you
[1:28:05] that attitude cuz God's actually telling
[1:28:07] you, there is a place for you.
[1:28:09] Hallelujah. There's mercy for you. Amen.
[1:28:11] Many people get annoyed. Well, you know,
[1:28:13] Esau was you hated before the foundation
[1:28:16] of the world. Well, he had a choice in
[1:28:18] this life. God knew the choice he would
[1:28:20] make and he despised the birthright.
[1:28:22] Jacob loved the birthright. What do we
[1:28:24] love? We love the birthright. We love
[1:28:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We Yeah.
[1:28:28] Amen. We love the opening of the word.
[1:28:30] Amen. We don't despise it. We don't
[1:28:32] belittle it, saying, "Well, this is just
[1:28:33] another religion. This ain't just
[1:28:34] another religion. This is the word of
[1:28:36] God. The promises of the ages coming
[1:28:38] down to culmination in this age."
[1:28:41] Hallelujah.
[1:28:43] Amen. So now here is here is uh Caleb
[1:28:45] and Joshua. Amen. They went and spite
[1:28:48] out the land. So now they were living in
[1:28:50] the fulfillment of the promise that God
[1:28:52] confirmed to Abraham. Hallelujah. And so
[1:28:55] they go into the land. Amen. They they
[1:28:56] they they they see the land. They see
[1:28:59] the giants. They see all these things,
[1:29:00] but they actually all they're seeing is
[1:29:02] promises. They heard about it. Now
[1:29:04] they're seeing it. Amen. So they saw
[1:29:06] their promises. That's my mountain.
[1:29:08] That's my resurrection mountain. Amen.
[1:29:11] That's that cool cool stream of healing.
[1:29:14] Amen. There's that peace of God. Amen.
[1:29:16] There's the joy of the Lord. Amen. They
[1:29:18] begin to walk up and down the place and
[1:29:20] see all the promises of God. There's a
[1:29:21] resurrection place. Amen. There's the
[1:29:24] divine healing place. Amen. There's a
[1:29:26] there's overcoming power in the land.
[1:29:28] They saw all the great promises of the
[1:29:30] land. And they didn't just see it, but
[1:29:31] they carried evidence back to the rest
[1:29:33] of the rest of the group. Amen. Saying,
[1:29:35] "Amen. Taste of the land. It's a good
[1:29:37] land." Amen. We've seen it. We've seen
[1:29:39] the promises. Hallelujah. Why? Because
[1:29:41] they're walking up and down the same
[1:29:43] land Abraham walked up and down. But now
[1:29:46] they are ordained to possess the land.
[1:29:48] Amen. They are ordained to possess the
[1:29:51] all the promises that God gave Abraham
[1:29:53] just like we are here to possess every
[1:29:55] promise God gave the early church. Amen.
[1:30:00] Hallelujah. And then so Caleb would
[1:30:02] Caleb would give a good report. He
[1:30:04] didn't give an evil report. And he tells
[1:30:07] the he tells the um people he says you
[1:30:10] know you because they're saying you know
[1:30:11] the others the others tasted the land
[1:30:14] but they said no we can't overcome it.
[1:30:16] So they basically said no the land is
[1:30:18] good the grapes taste good all these
[1:30:20] things but we can never be free of these
[1:30:22] problems. We're going to be stuck in
[1:30:23] this condition. We can't drive out these
[1:30:25] inhabitants. I got to live this way and
[1:30:27] you know this is this is as far as my
[1:30:29] Christian experience can go.
[1:30:32] That's a that's a spirit of unbelief.
[1:30:34] We got to say it for what it is. But if
[1:30:36] there's anything telling you you can
[1:30:37] never be free, that's a spirit of
[1:30:39] unbelief trying to rule your life. You
[1:30:40] look that thing in the eye and say, "You
[1:30:42] don't own me. My Lord owns me and you're
[1:30:45] coming down." Amen. You're not going to
[1:30:46] rule my life. You say, "Well, it's been
[1:30:48] generations and centuries and decades.
[1:30:50] I've seen this thing. I've never could
[1:30:52] never be free of it." Yeah, you can.
[1:30:54] Yeah, you can. Amen. Cuz Caleb said, so
[1:30:58] the 10 spies, they acknowledged the
[1:31:01] goodness of the land, but then they just
[1:31:02] saw the problems in the land. says,
[1:31:04] "Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:31:05] dwell in the land, and the cities are
[1:31:07] walled and very great. Moreover, they
[1:31:09] saw the children of Anch there. The
[1:31:10] Amalachites dwell in the land of the
[1:31:12] south, the Hittites, the Jebusites, the
[1:31:14] Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the
[1:31:16] Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the
[1:31:17] coast of Jordan. And Caleb stilled the
[1:31:20] people before Moses and said, "Let us go
[1:31:22] up at once and possess it for able to
[1:31:24] overcome it." Why? Because he realized
[1:31:26] the revelations dropped in his heart.
[1:31:29] What God promised our father, we're here
[1:31:31] to fulfill. Yes, sir. Amen. And what I
[1:31:34] love about the, you know, if you look at
[1:31:35] this word of, yeah, this is why I've
[1:31:37] opened my computer. Well, trying to find
[1:31:39] this here. He speaks of the speaks of
[1:31:42] the uh giants of giants. Uh yeah, the
[1:31:46] children of Anch. Now, this word anch is
[1:31:49] is is neat. Okay, so it's got two
[1:31:52] meanings. See, because Abra Caleb Caleb
[1:31:55] looked beyond the problems and saw the
[1:31:58] promise. You I was watching a Bible
[1:32:00] story with with William about Caleb. It
[1:32:03] just struck me. Caleb didn't see the
[1:32:05] giants. He saw the promise and he
[1:32:07] realized the promise was a greater value
[1:32:10] than defeating the enemy. Amen. He put
[1:32:13] this thing, well, I've got to fight this
[1:32:14] battle, but I'm going to get this. I
[1:32:16] want it. So, whatever's in front of me
[1:32:18] has got to go down because this is what
[1:32:19] I want. I want this promise. I want my
[1:32:21] inheritance more than anything. Amen.
[1:32:24] So, so this word anch, it means it means
[1:32:27] here it says, well, so it just says
[1:32:29] here, so the name Anch means long
[1:32:31] necked. Amen. But even these uh you so
[1:32:34] so and and and these people were giants
[1:32:37] and some people say well yes they were
[1:32:39] lot you know had long necks but maybe
[1:32:40] they didn't you know but judging by
[1:32:42] these scriptures it means also they had
[1:32:44] a lot of necklaces a lot of jewelry.
[1:32:47] Amen. So so they're giants. This just
[1:32:49] mean giants with long necks and they got
[1:32:51] a lot of wealth. So basically what
[1:32:54] you're saying, Caleb, is we're going to
[1:32:56] get rich by taking these guys down. And
[1:32:59] they got long necks, so we'll be able to
[1:33:00] cut their heads off pretty
[1:33:02] easy. So they're a big target and
[1:33:05] they're wealthy. So I'm going to I'm
[1:33:06] going to really prosper if these giants
[1:33:09] come down. Absolutely. Amen. You got to
[1:33:12] realize downing the giant, you say,
[1:33:14] "Well, you know, behind that giant,
[1:33:16] behind that complex or that or that, you
[1:33:19] know, there is a perfect marriage behind
[1:33:21] it. Amen. You mean you can have a
[1:33:24] perfect marriage? Hallelujah. You know,
[1:33:26] you Well, there's this, you know, so I
[1:33:29] just got to I just want to read this
[1:33:31] here. Do you mean I'll prosper? You
[1:33:33] know, I'll I'll get very rich by
[1:33:36] defeating these things. See, some people
[1:33:38] see the giants, other people see the
[1:33:40] promises. You down a spirit, you get
[1:33:42] rich.
[1:33:44] You got a testimony. It's got great
[1:33:46] value. I mean, you mean we can be
[1:33:48] perfectly one in a marriage. We have a
[1:33:50] perfect family. Absolutely. What's the
[1:33:51] giant standing in your way? Is it
[1:33:54] complexes, pains, hurts,
[1:33:55] misunderstandings? You mean I can be
[1:33:57] have a victorious walk every day of my
[1:33:59] life? What's the giant trying to hold
[1:34:01] you back? He's worth killing. He's worth
[1:34:05] killing. You'll become very rich. He's a
[1:34:06] big target. Who's with me today? Amen.
[1:34:08] You got to look at look at the word.
[1:34:10] Look at what the word says about what
[1:34:11] you should be. Amen. And if you're not
[1:34:13] that, you say, "God, kill the giants of
[1:34:16] my life that I will possess that
[1:34:17] promise." Amen. You're prodals. There's
[1:34:20] a giant there saying they can never come
[1:34:22] home. That's a lie. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:26] Say never be well. That's a lie. That's
[1:34:28] a giant. Amen. You'll get rich by
[1:34:30] killing that thing down. Amen. You never
[1:34:32] have peace. Never have these things.
[1:34:34] That's a giant trying to stop you
[1:34:36] getting your promise. I see other people
[1:34:39] shout and be, you know, happy and
[1:34:40] rejoicing, but you know, something in me
[1:34:42] says I shouldn't be like that. That's a
[1:34:44] giant.
[1:34:45] That's a giant. Be free to be you, but
[1:34:47] don't be quiet because of a giant. If
[1:34:50] you're made that way, that's fine as
[1:34:51] long as the word's impacting your life.
[1:34:53] But don't be quiet because of a
[1:34:54] conflict. Well, this person think, well,
[1:34:56] that person think I'm not worthy. I
[1:34:58] can't do that because of this and this
[1:34:59] and this. No, kill that giant. Amen. You
[1:35:02] see, many giants are our memory of our
[1:35:04] past that God has already taken care of.
[1:35:07] Kill the thing.
[1:35:09] Amen. You say we won't we can't have a
[1:35:12] honeymoon anymore. Kill it.
[1:35:15] Kill that thing. We can never fall in
[1:35:17] love again. That's a giant. That is a
[1:35:20] lying spirit.
[1:35:22] Kill it. Don't put up with it. What do
[1:35:25] you do? You do the opposite. You don't
[1:35:27] let that thing rule you. Let him take
[1:35:30] down. Let God take down the wall in your
[1:35:32] life. Amen. I trust this is okay. I'm
[1:35:34] feeling pretty good right now. Amen. You
[1:35:36] see, you got to realize every promise is
[1:35:38] yours. Oh, you know, I can never shout
[1:35:40] and be happy and I can never receive the
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost. That's a lie. The devil
[1:35:44] telling you there's nothing to this
[1:35:45] message. That's a lie. Amen. something.
[1:35:47] Why? You say, "I don't feel anything. I
[1:35:49] don't feel a pull." That's a lie. That's
[1:35:51] an enemy trying to numb you. Amen. Well,
[1:35:54] you see, he wants to get See, do I have
[1:36:03] that? Who wants a lolly?
[1:36:08] Who wants it? Who wants it? There you
[1:36:10] go, bro.
[1:36:15] What stopped them? What stopped everyone
[1:36:18] else getting up first? Was anyone
[1:36:20] holding anyone back? Was anyone? No. You
[1:36:25] had to make a choice. I'm getting that
[1:36:27] lolly. It was given. It was shown. The
[1:36:30] promise was there.
[1:36:32] The promise was there. You had to come
[1:36:34] get it. Only one person came and got it.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah. But you see, he gave it to
[1:36:39] someone else. Hallelujah. That's a
[1:36:42] that's good, too. You see, but it's like
[1:36:44] any promise of God. We can see it's
[1:36:46] there, but it starts with a decision.
[1:36:50] That's mine. I'm going to get that
[1:36:52] thing. And I think maybe if one of the
[1:36:54] girls got over here, maybe there would
[1:36:55] have been a push.
[1:36:59] I don't know. I'll bring more lollies
[1:37:02] maybe next time. Anyway, but you know
[1:37:03] what I mean. You got to you got a
[1:37:05] purpose in your heart. Every divine
[1:37:08] promise Jesus died for is mine. I'm not
[1:37:11] putting up with anything less than every
[1:37:13] promises in my possession. If it's joy,
[1:37:16] I want it. Peace, I want it. Overcoming
[1:37:19] power, I want it. All besetting sins
[1:37:21] under my feet, I want it. This flesh
[1:37:23] under me. Amen. My imagination. Anything
[1:37:25] that's contrary to the word of God, you
[1:37:27] got to realize it's yours to subdue.
[1:37:30] Yours to take under your control. It is
[1:37:32] within your power. Amen. Hallelujah. It
[1:37:35] is within your power to do it. God did
[1:37:37] not. Brother Ram says
[1:37:39] overcoming. God doesn't force us through
[1:37:41] a pipe and say you've overcome.
[1:37:43] You've got to overcome. You've got to
[1:37:45] surrender your own self and let God use
[1:37:48] you to overcome. You say, "I've got a
[1:37:51] big complex." It's just an easier target
[1:37:53] to take down. Amen. Amen. It's like if
[1:37:55] you're on the slopes of Mount Rupe who
[1:37:57] you see these kids gliding down and if
[1:37:59] they fall over, they just get back up
[1:38:00] again. Us adults fall over, it takes us
[1:38:02] a while to get back up again. Why? Cuz
[1:38:04] the bigger they are, the harder they
[1:38:06] fall. Yeah. Amen. What are we afraid of?
[1:38:10] See, it's it's we got to we got to
[1:38:14] realize God's given us promises. We've
[1:38:18] tasted and seen the Lord is good. But
[1:38:20] there's more than just a taste. There's
[1:38:22] a whole land to enjoy, a whole buffet to
[1:38:24] enjoy. There's a table that's been
[1:38:26] prepared. Amen. There's there's Brother
[1:38:28] Bram says, there's untapped resources in
[1:38:31] God. Amen. untapped things, untapped
[1:38:34] promises that have been laying there for
[1:38:36] centuries, quotes that have been laying
[1:38:38] there in the message. Amen. That that
[1:38:40] faith hasn't struck yet to make it live
[1:38:42] in the church.
[1:38:44] Why not go looking for it? You know, um
[1:38:46] my children and I, we were watching this
[1:38:48] documentary of these people in
[1:38:49] Antarctica. They're looking for giant
[1:38:51] squids, you know, colossal squids under
[1:38:53] the ice. They had these, you know,
[1:38:54] submarines that going down. Now, they
[1:38:57] knew they were there, but they had to go
[1:38:59] exploring to find it. and they showing
[1:39:02] footage of this certain squid and and
[1:39:04] you know they're saying this has never
[1:39:05] been never been videoed before. But
[1:39:08] finally you could say the technology is
[1:39:10] here to go see it and document it. 100
[1:39:14] years ago they didn't have that
[1:39:15] technology. There was Shackleton with
[1:39:17] his boat the endurance and all those
[1:39:18] things happened. They couldn't go under
[1:39:19] the ice and film all these things. The
[1:39:22] technology is here. Faith is here.
[1:39:26] Amen. to dig into this. Dig into the
[1:39:29] message to find things that we've just
[1:39:31] heard about, but it becomes a living
[1:39:33] reality in you. Amen. So why not why not
[1:39:38] give your life to digging into the
[1:39:40] promises of God? Why not give your life
[1:39:43] to possessing every promise? Amen. That
[1:39:46] is yours. You say, "Well, the previous
[1:39:48] generation did this and they did this
[1:39:50] and they did this." That's not you.
[1:39:52] Well, this is you now. This is your
[1:39:54] time. Amen.
[1:39:56] Amen.
[1:39:58] Hallelujah.
[1:40:00] Amen. But you see now Joshua had the joy
[1:40:03] of the Lord. You say, "Well, he only got
[1:40:06] to enjoy that land for a few few years."
[1:40:08] Maybe that's irrelevant. He was 40 years
[1:40:10] in the wilderness saying, "Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Hallelujah." Can you imagine the noise
[1:40:15] coming out of his tent? Hallelujah.
[1:40:18] Amen. He'd gather I know I've said it
[1:40:20] before, but it always strikes me I think
[1:40:21] about it. Yeah. He'd gather his family
[1:40:23] around in the evening time. They're
[1:40:25] eating mana. And he'll begin to testify.
[1:40:28] Children, I know you've heard this, but
[1:40:31] I want to tell it again. I got to tell
[1:40:33] it again because it's so alive to me.
[1:40:35] Amen. You know, children, you know, 40
[1:40:37] years ago, 39, whatever, I went over
[1:40:41] with Joshua. And I saw a mountain and I
[1:40:45] saw giants on that mountain, but but
[1:40:47] something quickened in my heart, that's
[1:40:48] mine. Hallelujah. We've got a good land
[1:40:50] to go to. I tasted the grapes. Who was
[1:40:53] there? and maybe those of the age, you
[1:40:54] know, had some and all these things. And
[1:40:56] you know, you see this man of children,
[1:40:58] this is just down payment proving
[1:40:59] there's a land. Amen. What we're
[1:41:01] feasting on now is just down payment
[1:41:03] saying we're going to a land and God's
[1:41:05] given us this land and I'm going to and
[1:41:07] we're going to walk there one day. Amen.
[1:41:09] The promise is going to be ours. Amen.
[1:41:10] It's going to be tangible, alive. And
[1:41:12] I'm going to tell you what I told you
[1:41:14] all those years is right here, right
[1:41:16] now. Hallelujah. And there'll be
[1:41:18] shouting and hallelujah. But then you go
[1:41:20] to the other tents, not uh not Joshua's
[1:41:22] tent, but the other tents, complaining,
[1:41:24] moaning, upset.
[1:41:26] The joy of the Lord wasn't those
[1:41:28] people's strength because they didn't
[1:41:30] have a revelation the land was theirs.
[1:41:32] Amen. So when God anchors a revelation
[1:41:34] in your heart, these promises are yours,
[1:41:36] it produces a joy.
[1:41:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So then finally,
[1:41:42] Caleb's 84 years old. Says to Joshua,
[1:41:45] I'm as strong now as I was. You It's
[1:41:46] amazing. Caleb doesn't do any
[1:41:48] supernatural
[1:41:49] miracles. He doesn't do a single thing
[1:41:52] that's supernatural in terms of stopping
[1:41:54] the moon and the stars or you know doing
[1:41:56] what we would call but the faith in his
[1:41:58] heart the revelation in his heart was
[1:42:01] supernatural.
[1:42:03] Amen. Because he was fixated. I have a
[1:42:05] promise. I'm getting that promise in my
[1:42:07] season and it's going to be mine. Amen.
[1:42:09] And he walked in. He killed those giants
[1:42:12] and he possessed his promise. Now, how
[1:42:14] about you and I today? Because we're not
[1:42:15] here on the outside in the in the
[1:42:17] wilderness looking in and saying maybe
[1:42:19] one day we'll enter in. No, the promised
[1:42:21] land has become open up. The word is
[1:42:23] opened up that every divine promise is
[1:42:25] yours and mine. So now is the season not
[1:42:29] just to talk about it is to talk about
[1:42:30] it and possess it. So what's holding us
[1:42:33] back?
[1:42:35] What does hinder? It ain't you, it ain't
[1:42:37] God. It's the enemy. But you got to
[1:42:39] identify if your thoughts are contrary
[1:42:41] to the word saying that you can't
[1:42:42] possess something. That's the enemy
[1:42:44] talking to you. Amen. If you're all
[1:42:46] bound up in your thinking saying you'll
[1:42:48] get nowhere with God, that's not God.
[1:42:49] That's not you. That's your enemy. Amen.
[1:42:51] If if there's something telling you that
[1:42:53] God can't restore a marriage or can't
[1:42:55] restore your family or bring your
[1:42:56] prodals home, that's the enemy trying to
[1:42:58] stop you from getting a promise.
[1:43:01] Why do we settle for anything less than
[1:43:04] the promises of God? We need to take
[1:43:06] inventory and say, "Hold on. Where I am
[1:43:09] right now, I'm living below my
[1:43:11] privilege.
[1:43:13] Amen. God wants to live for us to live
[1:43:15] according to our privileges in him.
[1:43:18] Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] Amen. Then Caleb, he went, he took
[1:43:23] Hebron. Hallelujah. Killed the giants.
[1:43:25] He possessed his promise. What was given
[1:43:27] to Abraham, he possessed it. Now, I'm
[1:43:30] just going to finish with this quote.
[1:43:31] Maybe we'll have the musicians this
[1:43:33] morning. I just want to leave it with
[1:43:35] that because we got to look at it. Lord,
[1:43:36] you've given us all these, you died,
[1:43:38] Lord, these promises. Amen. that the
[1:43:41] apostle Paul would write about all these
[1:43:42] great things, the powers of God would be
[1:43:45] made known to the church. Amen. That
[1:43:47] you'd know the height and the depth and
[1:43:48] the brit and the width and the love of
[1:43:50] God, the fullness of God, you would know
[1:43:52] and experience. Every promise that you
[1:43:54] know, every promise in the word is ours.
[1:43:56] Amen. That Satan would be under your
[1:43:58] feet. I mean, you walk in joy. You know,
[1:44:00] brother Bram says that a man can be so
[1:44:02] drunk he can be drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:44:04] every day of his life till he leaves
[1:44:06] this world.
[1:44:07] Hallelujah.
[1:44:10] Amen. Lord, make that my promise, Lord.
[1:44:13] I want to be drunk on your spirit. I
[1:44:14] don't want to be drunk on this world. I
[1:44:16] want to be overcome by the stimulation
[1:44:18] of revelation. Amen. Where the goodness
[1:44:20] of God just bubbles out. I just can't
[1:44:21] contain it no more. It just comes out
[1:44:23] like a mighty gusher. How good our God
[1:44:26] is. Hallelujah. Then you can go into
[1:44:28] your job site. You go into work, go into
[1:44:30] school, and there's just such a
[1:44:31] anointing around you. It's not negative.
[1:44:34] It's not being dragged down by this
[1:44:35] world. There's such a such a positive
[1:44:37] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. Say, "My
[1:44:39] God can do anything." Amen. You know,
[1:44:42] you know what I think? This is just me.
[1:44:44] I think God can do anything that comes
[1:44:45] through these doors. He can fix any
[1:44:48] problem. He can meet any need. I'm just
[1:44:50] convinced cuz he is God. Amen. Not
[1:44:52] because of who we are. Because of who he
[1:44:54] is, he can do anything. Hallelujah.
[1:44:56] There's nothing out of his reach. Amen.
[1:44:59] Lazarus was 4 days in the grave. He
[1:45:01] wasn't out of God's reach. Hallelujah.
[1:45:03] His body was gone. Everything was gone.
[1:45:05] Somebody wanted to prove I am the
[1:45:06] resurrection and the life. Amen. I gave
[1:45:08] Abraham and Sarah a resurrection. Made
[1:45:10] their bodies knew they could fulfill the
[1:45:12] promise. I'm going to bring him out of
[1:45:13] the grave, too. Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] Our God can do anything. I just feel
[1:45:19] that way. Amen. So, let's stand. Well,
[1:45:22] let's just read this. There's nothing
[1:45:23] good in any of us, but when you forget
[1:45:25] about preachers and personalities and
[1:45:27] look to the Lord Jesus Christ, then
[1:45:29] you've got to get somewhere. Take God at
[1:45:31] his word. Amen. So just focus on his
[1:45:34] promises. Don't look at anything else.
[1:45:37] Look at his word.
[1:45:40] Amen. What are we What are we playing
[1:45:41] there?

[1:53:24] promise of God. Amen. anything hindering
[1:53:27] to be moved out of the way for the Lord
[1:53:29] to show you what it is. Not to agree
[1:53:31] with the devil no more, but he'd be cast
[1:53:33] out of every facet of our lives. We have
[1:53:34] victory would possess the full promise.
[1:53:36] Amen. Gracious heavenly father. Lord,
[1:53:39] you see the hands that are raised
[1:53:40] through the building. I've got both up,
[1:53:41] Father. Lord, because this is the hour
[1:53:44] of full of every divine promise you've
[1:53:46] given, Lord God, will become manifested
[1:53:48] in your church and your bride. And
[1:53:50] Father, you're here to prove your word,
[1:53:51] Lord Jesus. So, Father, I pray in the
[1:53:54] name of Jesus Christ, any any giants,
[1:53:56] any complexes, any hindrances, Father,
[1:53:58] Lord, like Caleb, Lord, he acknowledged
[1:54:00] the giants, but he knew that that
[1:54:02] mountain was his. So, Father, he
[1:54:04] defeated those enemies and he possessed
[1:54:06] his promise. So, dear God, any enemies
[1:54:08] in our life, complexes, hurts, pains,
[1:54:10] family strains, whatever it may be,
[1:54:12] Father, Lord, that are not of you, Lord,
[1:54:14] may they be exposed in the name of Jesus
[1:54:16] Christ and may they be cast out, Father.
[1:54:18] We're not, Lord, we don't want to live
[1:54:19] below our privileges, Lord. We're going
[1:54:21] to live according to our privileges in
[1:54:22] you, dear God. To be joint ears with
[1:54:24] you, Father, with the enemy under our
[1:54:26] feet, Lord, with overcoming power
[1:54:28] flowing through our lives, Lord Jesus.
[1:54:30] The enemy can't stand before us. We
[1:54:32] thank you, dear God, for these things. I
[1:54:33] just want to pray for each one here,
[1:54:35] dear God. May we look into your word and
[1:54:36] see the promises that are ours, Lord,
[1:54:38] and by faith pursue those things. And
[1:54:41] Lord, get a hold of them for your glory.
[1:54:42] Lord, we thank you, Lord. Like
[1:54:44] Mphibicheth, Lord, these things are
[1:54:45] without human merit, Lord. He didn't
[1:54:47] earn a place at the table, but David
[1:54:49] called him to the table, Lord. We didn't
[1:54:51] earn a place at your table, Lord. You've
[1:54:52] called us to your table. We're so
[1:54:54] thankful we can sit under it and feast
[1:54:55] and rejoice, dear God. We praise your
[1:54:58] holy name, Lord. Thank you, Father, in
[1:55:00] Jesus Christ's name, I pray your richest
[1:55:01] blessings upon everyone here, those who
[1:55:03] may be watching, Lord. Father, in Jesus
[1:55:05] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[2:01:28] And I know where I
[2:01:31] stand. And I have
[2:01:35] the king in my
[2:01:38] [Applause]
[2:01:40] head. Gates of hell. Gates of
[2:01:46] hell. You won't be
[2:01:49] there on the rock of revelation.
[2:01:54] My
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:57] faithful I said all stand before me but
[2:02:03] all end up behind me
[2:02:08] I'm
[2:02:10] cla everything and I know who I
[2:02:15] am I know where I
[2:02:19] stand and I have the soul
[2:02:24] of the king in
[2:02:29] my
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:39] head. Amen. Let's just um as the music
[2:02:42] music plays, let's just pray this
[2:02:44] morning, you know, and that's
[2:02:46] it's it's so true that every promise in
[2:02:49] the word of God is ours. And if there
[2:02:52] are things that are materially existent
[2:02:54] in the word of God, we don't need
[2:02:56] anyone's permission to go and possess
[2:03:00] it. Dare I say, we don't even need the
[2:03:02] Lord's permission because he already
[2:03:04] said it's
[2:03:05] here, you know, and
[2:03:08] um often times we the support we give
[2:03:11] each other is the encouragement that
[2:03:13] look just go and get it, you know.
[2:03:15] That's the that's what we offer and our
[2:03:17] prayer. If someone else is going through
[2:03:19] something and we've overcome that
[2:03:20] battle, our prayer actually can help
[2:03:22] them to possess their promise. You help
[2:03:25] me, I help you.
[2:03:28] You know, I'm thinking of sister Hannah
[2:03:30] like you for argument sake like like she
[2:03:34] has material promises that exist for her
[2:03:38] children. They just they're not
[2:03:40] negotiable, right?
[2:03:42] And and I was just sitting in the P. I
[2:03:43] was
[2:03:45] thinking, you know, wouldn't it be great
[2:03:46] if if say one once a week, just one time
[2:03:50] during the week, you all who are gods,
[2:03:52] who's a god here this
[2:03:54] morning? Who's who whose words matter
[2:03:58] and whose words have
[2:04:01] power? What you speak has power. It's
[2:04:04] not just an
[2:04:05] empty bit of vibration and air that just
[2:04:08] floats off into the atmosphere and means
[2:04:10] nothing. The words you speak by a
[2:04:13] revelation of faith in your heart have
[2:04:17] power. Like if we said to sister Hannah,
[2:04:20] Hannah, what would be the what would
[2:04:21] what would you what would be something
[2:04:23] that you want me to speak for you this
[2:04:26] week? What would it
[2:04:28] be? I'll put you on the spot,
[2:04:32] but just quiet the piano slightly.
[2:04:37] Okay, I can turn it back up. Okay. So
[2:04:39] the So she wants the salvation of all of
[2:04:41] her family. All right. Yeah. So So
[2:04:45] now cuz Satan's a bit of a slicker, he
[2:04:50] and he and he he tries to get out of
[2:04:52] things, you know, in a legal process if
[2:04:54] there's a court case that some the judge
[2:04:57] will a a a lawyer will know that his
[2:04:59] client's guilty of sin. But if the due
[2:05:02] process wasn't followed in that case and
[2:05:04] he's going to go, "Aha, we've got a way
[2:05:06] to get you out of this because they
[2:05:07] didn't present this bit of evidence
[2:05:08] properly." So we can get you out of we
[2:05:10] can get you free based on this little
[2:05:12] technicality when he knows or she knows
[2:05:14] the client is this client's wrong.
[2:05:17] That's nonsense. But Satan does that
[2:05:19] same way, you know. So the reason why I
[2:05:20] say that is
[2:05:22] because you I like to say my children I
[2:05:25] like to say their first name, their
[2:05:26] middle name, their last name just so
[2:05:29] Satan knows exactly who I'm talking
[2:05:30] about. This is who I'm talking about.
[2:05:33] I'm I'm talking about this person here.
[2:05:37] So, if I was to pray for Hannah, you I'd
[2:05:39] like to find out her children's middle
[2:05:40] names. Cuz I say, "I'm praying for
[2:05:41] Hannah, you and I'm praying for this
[2:05:43] person here. First name, middle name,
[2:05:45] last name." And this is what I want for
[2:05:48] them.
[2:05:50] Cuz then there's no doubt like, and then
[2:05:52] I know if I my prayer has power. Now,
[2:05:56] there's another scripture too that says
[2:05:57] about the, you know, the woman that
[2:05:59] always went before the
[2:06:01] king. Now, I know my prayer has power,
[2:06:03] but I'm going to come back the next
[2:06:05] week. And I'm coming back the next week
[2:06:07] and I'm coming back the next week and I
[2:06:09] don't feel like I'm pestering the Lord.
[2:06:11] Like, oh, I feel like actually I'm doing
[2:06:13] what you said. You told me come.
[2:06:16] You told me to do
[2:06:18] this. You told me to pester you.
[2:06:22] You told me to keep knocking.
[2:06:25] Then here I am.
[2:06:28] And here I am the next week and this is
[2:06:30] what I want.
[2:06:33] It's like like Ben ran up and got the
[2:06:35] lollipop. This is what I want.
[2:06:39] I'm not going to sit down there. I'm
[2:06:41] going towards it because this is what I
[2:06:44] want. And it's written here. I've got
[2:06:46] every right. I'm going in to get it.
[2:06:49] It's that
[2:06:51] simple. So maybe this week if we What's
[2:06:54] your um Who are we after? Can I do this?
[2:06:57] Is that all right? Who are we after,
[2:06:58] Sister Hannah? What's your What's What's
[2:07:00] the What's the Give her a mic. I just
[2:07:02] need a You got a pen. Can someone give
[2:07:05] her the mic? Can I do this? Is that all
[2:07:07] right? I was just sitting in my pew
[2:07:09] thinking I want to do this. I'll do it
[2:07:10] next week, but I'll do it this week. Can
[2:07:12] you remember names? Good.
[2:07:15] Write it down. Okay. Well, give me a
[2:07:17] give me your Give me your first child's
[2:07:19] name. Full name. Esther. You. No, she's
[2:07:23] all good. She's here. We don't need to
[2:07:25] We're not going to waste our energy,
[2:07:26] man. We got to This has got to be a
[2:07:28] decisive battle. We're going like she's
[2:07:30] good. Deborah U. What's her middle name?
[2:07:33] Don't have a middle name. Oh, that's
[2:07:34] easy then. Deborah U. You remember that?
[2:07:40] And she is the daughter of Hannah U.
[2:07:43] Okay. Just so it's clear who we're
[2:07:45] talking about. Okay. Sorry. I'm actually
[2:07:47] I'm from South Korea. Even though you
[2:07:50] know I got married to David U, but still
[2:07:53] I've kept my surname. Okay. So my
[2:07:55] surname is Hen. Hen. H A N. Okay, that
[2:07:59] very important. See, could have been a
[2:08:01] little slicker. Got around that. Hannah,
[2:08:04] do we say h? Hen. Hannah. Hen.
[2:08:08] Remember that? Say it.
[2:08:11] Okay. Hannah Hen. And Deborah U. Yeah.
[2:08:15] And Elizabeth. U. Elizabeth. U. No
[2:08:19] middle name. So I'm No. No middle name.
[2:08:21] You don't have middle names. That makes
[2:08:22] it easy. And they have own Korean name.
[2:08:26] Okay. What in English? No. Who does
[2:08:28] Satan know them as? The English or the
[2:08:30] Korean name?
[2:08:32] Who do we know them as?
[2:08:35] We know them as the English name. I
[2:08:36] think we're good. Yeah. Elizabeth, you,
[2:08:40] Hannah, I mean Deborah, you and the
[2:08:44] daughters of
[2:08:45] Hannah Han.
[2:08:48] Thank you. Now she she wants on the
[2:08:51] basis of the word of God, she wants
[2:08:54] those children to be their hearts to be
[2:08:56] fully surrendered to the Lord Jesus and
[2:08:59] to be serving him 100% and their
[2:09:01] allegiances and their life and their
[2:09:03] soul over to him nowhere else.
[2:09:11] What? Yep. Yep. And what David have no
[2:09:15] middle name for David?
[2:09:18] So that's David. You
[2:09:21] the the what's that saying? The bigger
[2:09:23] they are, the harder they fall. I'm not
[2:09:26] talking about David. I'm talking about
[2:09:27] the enemy that thinks he's got him. The
[2:09:29] bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[2:09:34] Okay. Now, we also want him to come to a
[2:09:37] full revelation of the truth of the word
[2:09:38] of God and surrender his life 100% to
[2:09:41] the word of God. And any enemy that is
[2:09:44] binding his mind in any way, we want
[2:09:46] that broken. Amen.
[2:09:48] Amen. Now, when we speak that every if
[2:09:51] you want to do it every day, you can.
[2:09:52] But I if you if you'll commit to once a
[2:09:54] week, that's a lot of that's a lot of
[2:09:57] prayers. And they're focused. They're
[2:09:59] not just Lord, save the
[2:10:03] world. No, because we can go in faith
[2:10:06] because we know Sister Hannah and I I
[2:10:07] think I can keep saying this
[2:10:09] because I don't believe there's anything
[2:10:12] hindering it. That's what I'm saying.
[2:10:14] You know, I don't I wouldn't just jump
[2:10:16] up and some a complete stranger. Let's
[2:10:17] just all pray this for that person. We
[2:10:19] don't know what. But I don't believe
[2:10:20] that's in this situation. I believe this
[2:10:22] is just something we're going to
[2:10:25] possess.
[2:10:27] And I'd like you all to use your faith
[2:10:30] this week and every week until we get
[2:10:32] this. We're not going to rest till we
[2:10:33] get this. We're not We're in this for
[2:10:36] the long term. If it's a day, if it's a
[2:10:38] week, if it's a year, if it's months, if
[2:10:39] it's We don't care. We're in this for
[2:10:41] the long haul. We're not giving up.
[2:10:43] We're getting this end of story.
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:49] Period. Not we're not relenting. We're
[2:10:51] not going to think well no. Every day we
[2:10:53] speak, we pray, we move
[2:10:55] forward. That's it. Every time we pray,
[2:10:58] it gets a little bit closer. It's just
[2:11:00] it's pulling it into there. It's things
[2:11:01] are happening when you profess it, when
[2:11:04] you claim it. And you can even speak it
[2:11:06] if you'd like to. You don't even need to
[2:11:08] pray in Jesus' name. I'm probably going
[2:11:10] on. But you are sons and daughters of
[2:11:12] God. You can actually speak it. I want
[2:11:14] this for
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] her. I'm just saying. Is that all right
[2:11:19] to say that? But I would suggest you can
[2:11:21] pray in Jesus' name. But I'm saying
[2:11:23] don't doubt who you are because you are
[2:11:25] Mrs. Jesus Christ anyway. Are you not?
[2:11:28] Yes.
[2:11:30] That is who you are. We have authority.
[2:11:34] We don't just have to sit back and say,
[2:11:35] "Oh, well, we have authority."
[2:11:39] And and I I just Yeah, I've won this
[2:11:43] battle before. So, I know it's it's
[2:11:44] probably why I'm speaking of it because
[2:11:45] I know it's overcomeable. I know you can
[2:11:47] win. That's why I want to It's why maybe
[2:11:50] it feels something to me cuz I know that
[2:11:51] we can win this one. It's like I fought
[2:11:54] this giant. I've slain this one, man.
[2:11:56] This one's doable. This giant's this is
[2:11:59] defeatable.
[2:12:01] You know, sorry to take up some of your
[2:12:03] time there, but I just would you get
[2:12:05] Would you do that for Sister Hannah? Can
[2:12:07] we do that for her? And can we do it
[2:12:09] once a week, everybody? Just once a
[2:12:11] week. Speak it. And we're going to We're
[2:12:12] dealing with this one. Sister Hannah.
[2:12:15] We're dealing with it.
[2:12:19] Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:21] Let's just pray. Hannah, come at the
[2:12:23] front. Let's just pray for Sister Hannah
[2:12:24] and Sister Elizabeth. Is that all right?
[2:12:25] Can we just do that? This means
[2:12:27] something to her. This is like this is
[2:12:28] life. This is what they This is
[2:12:30] important to her.

[2:13:58] salvation for the whole family. Let
[2:14:01] every demon power that is standing
[2:14:04] against Lord Hannah Han's wishes be
[2:14:07] broken in the name of Jesus Christ. Your
[2:14:10] blood speaks freedom this morning, this
[2:14:12] afternoon. Your blood says they are
[2:14:14] free. Hallelujah. There is nothing Lord
[2:14:16] too hard father for you. Let your
[2:14:18] promises be realized now Lord in the
[2:14:20] name of Jesus Christ. We lift up the
[2:14:23] Lord the you family into your presence
[2:14:25] Lord. We bring them, Father, Lord, to
[2:14:27] the throne of grace, Lord. And we pray,
[2:14:29] Father, that you would allow an
[2:14:31] expression of divine grace, Lord.
[2:14:33] Unmmerited favor, Lord Jesus, to be upon
[2:14:36] the you family, the Han family, Lord
[2:14:38] Jesus, Father. And I pray, Lord, that as
[2:14:40] Hannah delights herself in you, grant
[2:14:42] her the desire of her heart. And Lord,
[2:14:44] may you bring a reminder to each one of
[2:14:46] us, Lord, that we're batting for them,
[2:14:48] Lord. We're fighting for them, Lord.
[2:14:49] We're together in this, Lord. for
[2:14:51] without her family, we're not going
[2:14:52] nowhere, Lord Jesus, because they're
[2:14:54] part of this family in the name of Jesus
[2:14:56] Christ. Oh, we thank you, Lord. We know
[2:14:57] that Lord Hannah has battled through
[2:14:59] many, many years, many years, Father.
[2:15:02] She's fought for this. She stood for
[2:15:03] this, Lord. And Father, maybe we
[2:15:05] haven't, Lord, remembered it all the
[2:15:06] time, Lord. But now we will, Lord. We're
[2:15:08] here, Lord Jesus, with her, Lord. We
[2:15:10] are, Lord Jesus. Father, your wife, the
[2:15:12] bride of Jesus, Father, and Lord will
[2:15:14] stand. Let us speak, Lord, for the word
[2:15:16] is near us, even in our mouths, Lord.
[2:15:18] Let us speak the word with boldness. Let
[2:15:20] us speak the word with love. Let your
[2:15:22] love, Father, come and drive out any
[2:15:24] fear, Lord, and reneutralize any of the
[2:15:26] enemy's plans for Father, Lord. We know
[2:15:29] that the enemy has plotted lies against
[2:15:31] Hannah. The enem is plotted lies against
[2:15:33] David. Plotted lies against Deborah.
[2:15:34] Plotted lies against all Lord, all the
[2:15:36] family, Lord. Elizabeth, even Lord, who
[2:15:38] may be in here. Hannah may be in here,
[2:15:40] Lord. They're fighting, Lord. They're
[2:15:41] battling, Father. But Lord Jesus, we
[2:15:43] have overcome, Lord. For even our faith
[2:15:45] is the victory that overcomes this
[2:15:47] world. And Jesus says, "Fear not, for I
[2:15:50] have overcome the world." Don't be
[2:15:51] troubled in your heart. I've prepared a
[2:15:53] place for you. I've prepared a place for
[2:15:55] your family. I've prepared a place for
[2:15:56] David. I prepared a place for Esther. I
[2:15:58] prepared a place, Father, for for all of
[2:16:00] the girls. Oh, Deborah and Elizabeth.

[2:16:03] a seat. Oh, come to the table. Feast at

[2:16:58] the Lord.
[2:17:00] God bless
[2:17:02] you. God bless
[2:17:06] you. I felt the inspiration there when
[2:17:08] brother Andy prayed. There is a seat at
[2:17:11] the table for them.
[2:17:14] Like when you realize that, you're like,
[2:17:15] "Well, hang on. It's not going to be
[2:17:17] empty. There are no empty seats. No
[2:17:19] empty seats there. There's a seat there
[2:17:21] with their name on it. We can rejoice
[2:17:23] now, Sister Hannah. We're good. It's all
[2:17:26] good. We're good. Amen. Amen. Let's just
[2:17:30] um I'll just pray and just close the
[2:17:32] service in prayer. Lord, we just thank
[2:17:33] you, Lord, that we can come to
[2:17:36] you, Lord, and you gave us all things
[2:17:38] this morning, Lord. I mean that's we
[2:17:41] just thank you Lord that we are alive
[2:17:42] that we have the ability
[2:17:44] to have faith in you and to walk forward
[2:17:46] in your name Lord Jesus. I just pray you
[2:17:49] bless each one this morning Lord bless
[2:17:50] us as we go our way. May we may we just
[2:17:53] refresh our spirits in the Holy Ghost
[2:17:54] daily Lord so we can continue to fight
[2:17:56] the good fight of faith. We we know that
[2:17:58] in us, Lord, in our carnal nature, there
[2:18:00] is no desire to press forward by faith,
[2:18:03] Lord. But when we feed upon your spirit,
[2:18:05] when your spirit is burning in us, Lord,
[2:18:07] there's there's a there's an a a it
[2:18:10] seems so effortless to push forward in
[2:18:11] you, Lord, because there's a power in
[2:18:13] the Holy Ghost that's dwelling in us
[2:18:15] that just moves forward, Lord. It knows
[2:18:16] no way but forward, Lord. It was the
[2:18:18] same power that inspired Caleb, Lord,
[2:18:20] and Joshua to move forward, Lord. It was
[2:18:23] the same power that's inspired every
[2:18:25] saint all through the ages to move
[2:18:26] forward, Lord. and and we know it's not
[2:18:28] our works, Lord, but it's surrendering
[2:18:30] to you and letting your spirit come and
[2:18:32] dwell in us richly, Lord, that we could
[2:18:33] move forward by faith each and every
[2:18:35] day. So, I just pray you'll continue to
[2:18:36] refresh each one with the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:38] May they be diligent in their prayer
[2:18:40] time with you to to not walk in the in
[2:18:42] the flesh, Lord, but walk in the spirit
[2:18:43] each day so that we could walk and
[2:18:45] possess all that you have for us. Lord,
[2:18:46] thank you for the word this morning.
[2:18:48] Thank you for a pastor, Lord, that
[2:18:50] preaches faith, Lord, that preaches an
[2:18:52] entrance into the kingdom of God. Lord,
[2:18:54] that doesn't come here and preach doubt
[2:18:56] and preach just failure, but he preaches
[2:18:58] victory and faith, Lord, because we know
[2:19:00] that comes from you, Lord Jesus. So, we
[2:19:01] just want to commit each one to your
[2:19:02] hands this morning in Jesus wonderful
[2:19:04] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this
[2:19:07] morning. You're dismissed in Jesus'
[2:19:08] name. Let's sing um I know it's a little
[2:19:11] bit fast. Let's sing Come and Dine. I
[2:19:13] was just thinking about the
[2:19:17] table. No, no, let's sing. Actually,
[2:19:20] let's sing that table song that they
[2:19:21] sing in Sunday school. What? I was like,
[2:19:25] "Oh, can we do comment?" No, no, no. I'm
[2:19:28] so glad you got that.
[2:19:31] We'll do this. We'll do the other. We
[2:19:32] got plenty of time. Well, you you're
[2:19:34] dismissed in Jesus name, but you can you
[2:19:36] can stay if you want. Shall I shall I
[2:19:38] just change it? Actually, we'll do the
[2:19:40] other
[2:19:40] one. Do you know it's not Some people
[2:19:43] are too prideful to change. You know,
[2:19:45] they make a decision. They But humans,
[2:19:47] we have to admit we're fallible. You
[2:19:48] know, we think one thing one day and
[2:19:50] then we learn something that night, then
[2:19:51] we change our mind the next day. Nothing
[2:19:54] wrong with that. It's called growth.
[2:19:57] Hey, the Lord the Lord thinks something
[2:19:59] one day and the next day it's exactly
[2:20:01] the same. So, he never makes mistakes,
[2:20:02] but we
[2:20:07] do. Let's go higher.
