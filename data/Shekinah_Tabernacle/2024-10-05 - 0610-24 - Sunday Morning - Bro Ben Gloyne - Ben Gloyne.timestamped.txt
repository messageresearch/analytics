[5:24] emotional sort of Journey on that is it
[5:28] it makes your mind a little bit but I'm
[5:31] glad to be refresh in the Holy Ghost um
[5:33] this morning and yeah but I mean it's a
[5:34] sad it's a very sad time for the family
[5:36] for my brothers children for my parents
[5:39] for the siblings and that
[5:41] um you know and but I'm glad as a
[5:45] Christian you know like like like for
[5:48] me I've built my life upon the word of
[5:51] God so I can declare that when the
[5:55] storms of life
[5:57] come I stand
[6:00] you know you know people may make fun of
[6:03] the the things of God and that and Bel
[6:05] little at all you know but you let a
[6:07] storm hit sometime and you know all the
[6:09] ridicule is worth it then and all the
[6:11] all what you go through is worth it then
[6:12] when you can hold through any storm it
[6:14] just you just hold you know so I I thank
[6:17] God for that that that as Paul said none
[6:19] of these things move me you know we
[6:22] where as Believers you know we we build
[6:24] our life upon the word of God and we can
[6:26] stand so we're here this morning to
[6:28] praise the Lord and and we're going to
[6:30] have a great time in the Lord and I just
[6:31] just as a notice we could we do the
[6:34] choir practice sort of change the vibe a
[6:37] bit but I just want to make sure we get
[6:38] can we do the choir practice straight
[6:39] after
[6:40] church will that be okay you have a good
[6:43] little breakfast this morning cuz it'll
[6:44] be a little bit longer till you get
[6:46] lunch okay but we'll try and cuz some of
[6:48] the Brethren are not actually staying
[6:50] for lunch they got to they're going away
[6:52] to different places so if we could sort
[6:53] of stay straight after church including
[6:55] you Bruce
[6:57] [Laughter]
[7:02] okay so that'll be straight away so yeah
[7:03] praise the Lord let's stand this morning
[7:04] and and um yeah but the the the Lord
[7:08] willing I'm actually ministering next
[7:09] weekend and and some of the what the
[7:11] experiences that I've been through which
[7:12] were quite powerful will sort of weave
[7:14] into the thought I
[7:16] had in light of what's happened so yeah
[7:18] just that I maybe I may share a little
[7:21] bit a bit more then because we we serve
[7:24] such a powerful God you know and there's
[7:27] that the the the way that is the the the
[7:30] way that God's mind works is outstanding
[7:32] and the power that he has and and the
[7:35] power that he has to reach places and do
[7:37] things is outstanding you know and I've
[7:38] experienced a bit of that you know when
[7:40] he stretches forth his hand just a
[7:42] little bit further you think I wonder if
[7:43] God can reach there and he just reaches
[7:44] down to that point you know so yeah
[7:47] let's let's the Lord willing will sort
[7:48] of speak on a bit of that next week

[39:05] amen Camp soon praise God looking
[39:08] forward to that amen praise the Lord so
[39:11] Revelations 12: 7 I know is very
[39:13] familiar probably one of my favorite
[39:15] favorite scriptures I always like to
[39:17] read the end of the book and when I read
[39:19] a book and see who wins and who doesn't
[39:20] where you know and praise the Lord when
[39:22] you can see yourself in the end of the
[39:24] book amen so and there was war in heaven
[39:26] Michael and his Angels fought against
[39:28] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[39:29] angels and prevailed not I put that in
[39:31] yellow CU I like those words he didn't
[39:34] win neither was there Place found
[39:35] anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon
[39:37] was cast out that old serpent called the
[39:39] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[39:41] whole world he was cast out into the
[39:43] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[39:45] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[39:47] heaven now has come salvation and
[39:49] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[39:51] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[39:53] of our Brethren is cast down which
[39:55] accused them before our God day and
[39:57] night and they overcame him by the blood
[40:00] of the lamb and by the word of their
[40:01] testimony and their love not their lives
[40:03] unto the death amen so let's bow our
[40:06] heads in a word of prayer this morning
[40:08] amen if you want to be remembered in
[40:09] prayer just just raise your hands to the
[40:11] Lord amen God sees every need every
[40:13] desire amen let's pray together gracious
[40:15] Heavenly Father truly Lord our hearts
[40:17] desires that you Lord you'd re upon us
[40:20] with your spirit Lord there' be Showers
[40:22] of Blessings Lord Showers of refreshing
[40:24] from your presence oh God this morning
[40:26] so we just want to commit Our Lives into
[40:28] your hands once again Lord we just want
[40:29] to invite you to where we are father
[40:31] every situation we're walking in Lord
[40:33] may you just come and take over and have
[40:35] your way in our lives and mold us and
[40:37] shape us more into your image Lord and I
[40:39] pray father that Lord as uh as we read
[40:42] your word today or as we have read your
[40:43] word as we go through Lord this uh
[40:46] service I pray when it's all said and
[40:47] done we'd appreciate you more we'd love
[40:49] you more we'd have more confidence what
[40:51] you have done for us Lord we love you we
[40:54] thank you for what you've done We Praise
[40:56] You Lord be with those who could be here
[40:57] today as well Lord we commit them into
[40:59] your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[41:02] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[41:04] have your seats too uh uh this morning
[41:06] so I want to speak about I know this is
[41:09] um you know the Christian journey is
[41:11] actually a very simple one and actually
[41:14] walking in Victory is actually a very
[41:16] simple thing it's not a complicated the
[41:18] Christian Life is a very simple thing
[41:20] man makes it complicated the devil sure
[41:22] wants to make it complicated but it's
[41:24] very simple now as we as we read here
[41:27] they overcame and by the blood of the
[41:28] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[41:30] okay so that scripture is prophesying of
[41:32] you right you're living out that
[41:34] scripture whether you realize that if
[41:35] you're a Christian you believe this
[41:36] morning you're living that scripture out
[41:39] sure there's going to be battles like
[41:40] the brother like brother Ram said the
[41:41] devil will punch at you but he can't get
[41:44] you right but he'll fight you and do all
[41:45] he can but we got to realize we're going
[41:48] to overcome right and we are overcoming
[41:49] if you got faith in your heart this
[41:51] morning you've got overcoming power amen
[41:54] so now we're going to look into because
[41:56] the blood Yo God has put such a perfect
[41:58] barrier between us and the devil a
[42:01] perfect weapon a perfect armor A Perfect
[42:03] Defense amen but it's when we try and
[42:05] inject ourselves into it or you know if
[42:08] we try and emphasize well what do we
[42:10] have to do and do we have to protect
[42:12] ourselves no the blood protects us now
[42:14] if I may sound a bit flippant I'm not
[42:17] sounding flippant today okay but I want
[42:19] you to have full confidence in your
[42:21] defense full confidence in your weapon
[42:23] full confidence in your God because if
[42:24] there's ever a people upon the face of
[42:26] the plan
[42:27] am mean that can have full confidence in
[42:30] who the Lord is and what he has done it
[42:33] is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[42:35] because the True Believer does not
[42:37] inject his own human Works into his
[42:39] salvation or his victory amen no the
[42:41] True Believer has full confidence and
[42:43] what the Lord has done and he allows God
[42:46] to manifest that victory in their lives
[42:49] amen so this is where we are now I just
[42:51] want to go if you want to turn to me or
[42:53] you can just read it up here but you
[42:54] know I want to read about in the first
[42:56] Exodus there a there was instructions we
[42:58] know you we've been reading through
[43:00] Exodus as a family uh you as a chapter
[43:02] of night you with family prayer and so
[43:04] we just read recently this you know we
[43:06] are into the time where you know they've
[43:08] just danced on the other side of the Red
[43:09] Sea and maybe we'll come to that in a
[43:11] few Sundays I don't know but this is
[43:12] where we were not not that long ago but
[43:15] God tells Moses he says you know God
[43:17] comes down to a point where he's he's
[43:19] he's plagued Pharaoh long enough now
[43:21] it's time to leave now it's time to
[43:23] leave amen so you know there'll be a
[43:25] time when we leave but we must must be
[43:27] prepared to leave but God gives
[43:29] instructions here and and I'm just going
[43:31] to read it through it's a bit lengthy
[43:32] but we're going to go down to uh verse
[43:34] 17 but says and the Lord spake unto
[43:37] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[43:38] saying this month shall be unto you the
[43:41] beginning of months it shall be the
[43:42] first month of the year to you why
[43:44] because a new life is going to start
[43:46] right they've been in slavery now
[43:47] there's a transition they ain't going to
[43:49] be in slavery no more amen now speak ye
[43:51] unto all the congregation of Israel
[43:53] saying in the 10th day of this month
[43:55] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[43:57] according to the house of their fathers
[43:58] a lamb for an house and if the household
[44:00] be too little for the lamb let him and
[44:02] his neighbor next unto his house take it
[44:04] according to the number of the souls
[44:06] every man according to his eating shall
[44:07] be your count for the lamb your lamb
[44:10] shall be without blemish a male of the
[44:12] first year you shall take it from your
[44:13] sheep or from the goats now remember
[44:16] this is this is in type speaking of our
[44:18] Lord Jesus he is our Passover right so
[44:21] when we when we have this uh have this
[44:23] in mind there's a spiritual application
[44:25] we're going into now I know this is all
[44:26] familiar to all of but there is a pro
[44:28] you fear comes in among Believers when
[44:30] they say have I done
[44:32] enough all we are required to do is is
[44:35] is let God fulfill his word in our lives
[44:37] so God gives the word and then we allow
[44:39] it to live right so Moses told them take
[44:42] the lamb as we're reading take the blood
[44:45] apply the blood right they all they had
[44:48] to do was obey the
[44:50] word right that's all they had to do
[44:52] it's very it's it's not rocket science
[44:55] right it's not so okay and you shall
[44:58] keep it till the 14th day of the same
[44:59] month and the whole assembly of the
[45:01] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[45:02] the evening they shall take the blood
[45:04] and strike it on the two side posts and
[45:06] on the upper door poost of the houses R
[45:08] they shall eat it and they shall eat the
[45:10] Flesh in that night roast with fire and
[45:13] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[45:14] they shall eat it eat it eat not of it
[45:17] raw nor Soden it all with water but
[45:19] roast with fire his head with his legs
[45:22] and with the pertinent Parts thereof so
[45:23] they're instructed don't boil this lamb
[45:27] don't dilute this lamb don't add a bit
[45:28] of water to this lamb you got to roast
[45:30] it with fire so now we know our lamb is
[45:33] the Lord Jesus he is the word right so
[45:35] we are like they did they became one
[45:37] with their sacrifice right before I know
[45:39] I've said this byi every communion
[45:40] service but before this happened you'd
[45:42] see a family and a lamb then you saw no
[45:46] longer the lamb but then you saw the
[45:48] blood on the doorpost and then you saw
[45:50] the people walk out in the morning right
[45:53] they became one with their sacrifice and
[45:54] they left Egypt under the strength or by
[45:57] the strength of that lamb amen so it
[46:00] comes with us now there's the message
[46:02] but the message and you must become one
[46:04] you and the word must become one you see
[46:06] it was no good for them in Israel now
[46:07] notice here Moses does not say here you
[46:10] must be an Israelite believer to do this
[46:14] anyone could apply the blood anyone
[46:16] could apply the blood no matter how bad
[46:18] how good how how whatever they are
[46:20] whatever their past was that's
[46:21] irrelevant God wasn't looking at the
[46:23] ones in the house he was looking at the
[46:25] blood on the house that's what he was
[46:27] looking at he says when I see that blood
[46:29] not when I see you when I see the blood
[46:31] I will pass over you so it doesn't
[46:33] matter the condition of the Israelite
[46:35] before they applied the blood God wasn't
[46:37] looking at them anyhow I mean it's the
[46:39] same thing with you and I friends God is
[46:40] not looking at us he's looking at the
[46:42] blood but we look at ourselves we're
[46:44] looking at the wrong thing and we build
[46:46] up pressure because we look at ourselves
[46:48] but if we look at the blood we can let
[46:50] off the pressure rejoice and have full
[46:52] confidence God is going to protect us
[46:54] amen because the blood uh the death
[46:57] Angel went into he could not go into any
[46:59] of those houses where the blood was
[47:00] applied it was impossible for him to do
[47:03] it amen it was impossible it's the same
[47:05] thing when when that Death Angel because
[47:07] there's spiritual death riding the land
[47:09] today we understand that there's
[47:10] spiritual death that's on to come into
[47:12] churches come into houses come into
[47:14] individual lives and all these things
[47:15] but he cannot bypass or over go over the
[47:19] blood he cannot go beyond that barrier
[47:21] it's a perfect barrier amen and now we
[47:24] understand now I hope I'm not jumping
[47:25] here to my well just come to here they
[47:28] had to they had to have burn the whole
[47:31] lamb they had to roast the whole lamb
[47:33] they couldn't take that lamb and Butcher
[47:36] and just get the nice chops they
[47:38] couldn't just get parts of the word that
[47:40] they liked amen if the word said that
[47:42] your hair grow Out Sisters they let it
[47:44] grow out they ate that part amen if it
[47:46] said to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[47:48] Christ they ate that part they became
[47:49] one with that part right they didn't
[47:51] just say well I don't like that that's
[47:53] not to my taste none of us you know I'm
[47:55] sure we'd all agree
[47:57] I don't I wouldn't want to eat the whole
[47:59] lamb naturally I want certain parts
[48:03] we're all we're all very familiar you
[48:04] know with this you know I very rarely
[48:06] see a hunter come out of the Bush and
[48:08] he's got all the intrs of the
[48:11] deer no you don't Bry that
[48:15] okay but we got to take the whole word
[48:18] we can't just take the bits that are
[48:19] convenient that are sociably acceptable
[48:21] we must take the whole word and become
[48:23] one with it see it was no good on that
[48:25] day to sympathize with what Moses was
[48:26] saying see you got to be not just a
[48:28] hearer of the word but a doer of the
[48:30] word it says in James right so and now I
[48:33] know I'm looking at people who are doers
[48:34] of the word amen all right but you see
[48:37] and it's also now it says don't eat it
[48:39] raw nor Soden it at all with water so
[48:42] there got to be some fire in this I mean
[48:44] there's got to be some fire burning as
[48:46] you're eating the word as you're eating
[48:48] the lamb it can't be it can't be boiled
[48:50] right it's got to be there's got to be a
[48:51] Holy Ghost and Fire Burning in your
[48:54] souls as you as you eat the lamb amen as
[48:56] you take of the word there's got to be a
[48:58] fire there and it can't be a man-made
[49:00] fire it can't can't be just man-made
[49:02] enthusiasm or or or a human self-will
[49:05] that I'm going to be a Christian no
[49:07] there's got to be a fire there of the
[49:08] Holy Ghost amen there's got to be
[49:10] there's got to be some you know who
[49:12] loves you know the roast lamb comes out
[49:14] of the
[49:15] oven I want that the door may be half
[49:18] open I want that cuz it's been roasted
[49:20] it's being burn it's hot you know and
[49:22] the same thing with the word there's got
[49:23] to be a holy ghost fire burning in your
[49:25] soul as you partake of the word amen it
[49:28] can't be it can't be boiled it can't be
[49:30] diluted with water it can't be anything
[49:32] like that no it must be roasted with
[49:35] fire amen but the thing is he says thus
[49:37] you shall eat it with your loines GED
[49:40] your shoes on your feet and your staff
[49:41] on your hand and you shall eat it in
[49:43] haste for it is the Lord's Passover so
[49:45] now it's it it it seems very contrary if
[49:47] you think naturally when you invite
[49:49] people for a meal they don't come in and
[49:51] sit at your table dressed to go out in
[49:52] the
[49:53] outdoors normally you come in and sit
[49:56] and comfortable cloth to eat right so
[49:59] but they instructed you've got to be
[50:01] dressed to leave when you eat this lamb
[50:04] I mean because you're preparing to leave
[50:06] the applying of the blood the eating of
[50:08] the Lamb the sacrificing of the Lamb all
[50:10] these things is that is is is you are
[50:13] leaving here but they were instructed to
[50:16] stay in their house under the blood
[50:18] until marching orders came right they
[50:20] were ready to leave at any time but they
[50:22] had to stay in Passover until until
[50:25] marching orders came to leave now we are
[50:27] going to have marching orders to leave
[50:29] one day that Trump the dead and Christ
[50:30] are going to raise right that's time
[50:32] that that's when it's going to be you're
[50:34] leaving this Earth bride right but until
[50:36] that time we must stay under the blood
[50:38] in Passover with our lamb until marching
[50:41] orders come now we understand communion
[50:43] is
[50:44] a is a is a relationship right when we
[50:47] say we're taking communion it's more
[50:49] than just an ordinance of the Bible you
[50:51] know fulfilling the scripture but it's
[50:52] showing you have you have a relationship
[50:54] with the Lord Jesus Christ where he
[50:57] talks to you and you talk to him amen
[50:59] that it's an everyday Affair that that
[51:01] it's it's you and him together walking
[51:03] walking life's journey so this communion
[51:06] we we are told to stay in communion
[51:09] now let let's just get this out here
[51:11] everyday simple Christian Living is
[51:14] overcoming don't go after shiny things
[51:17] don't go after the new Fantastics of
[51:18] things walk with God and His word every
[51:21] day amen if you see the purpose of every
[51:24] day then you'll be victorious Joseph
[51:26] remember Joseph was so gripped by those
[51:28] two dreams that one day his family will
[51:30] bow to him he'll be in a place of
[51:31] leadership that he let his life be
[51:33] governed by that but what was he doing
[51:36] he was serving in Piper's house he was
[51:38] there in the prison he became the leader
[51:39] of the prison he was all these things
[51:41] but he was every day he was gripped by
[51:43] the fact that he was going to end up to
[51:45] fulfill that dream and God was going to
[51:47] cause that dream to be fulfilled so
[51:49] every day he saw the purpose of every
[51:51] day now every day was probably there
[51:53] probably wouldn't would not have been a
[51:55] lot of difference from Monday to Friday
[51:57] in a prison and Saturday Sunday too
[52:00] right or even pipus house it would have
[52:01] been very similar maybe things would
[52:03] change with Seasons different jobs will
[52:05] come up but it'll be a very similar life
[52:09] but he realized that this was all for
[52:11] his good to shape him because he was
[52:13] going to end up amen there at the right
[52:15] hand of pharaoh literally Pharaoh over
[52:17] Egypt right so we've got to see the
[52:19] value of everyday Christian Living right
[52:22] because we got to realize that if we
[52:23] stay in Passover now we're going to be
[52:25] living a life amen that's going to be on
[52:28] display through the whole world because
[52:30] words are very cheap I say words have
[52:32] never been cheaper than they are today
[52:34] people will give you all kind of
[52:36] promises give all kind of word salers
[52:37] get all kind of things but it's a life
[52:40] it's a character it it seems very
[52:42] strange nowadays character is very
[52:45] undervalued in this day it used to be
[52:47] politicians character was important now
[52:50] it's not
[52:51] important you can look at the
[52:52] presidential election here in you know
[52:54] there in the United States I'd say
[52:56] character is not even brought into it
[52:58] it's empty promises and word salads both
[53:01] sides it's a mad house but the world has
[53:04] to go mad and it is mad but you see
[53:07] character is a very cheap I mean in the
[53:09] eyes of man it's not really valued Much
[53:11] Anymore moral values and how men should
[53:13] be women should be in our character and
[53:15] even just being true to our word you
[53:17] know how many agreements do we sign
[53:19] contracts and there's so many sub
[53:21] Clauses and things to make sure you have
[53:22] to fulfill your your end of the bargain
[53:25] when it just used to be yeah I'll do it
[53:26] and if I can't do it I'll tell you if I
[53:28] can't do it it used to be that way so
[53:31] words are very cheap and character is
[53:32] not valued anymore but I say in The
[53:34] Bride of Jesus Christ because God values
[53:36] character God values genuine Christian
[53:38] character that you be a true
[53:40] representation your life is a true
[53:42] representation of the word of the Lamb
[53:45] because remember they walked out of
[53:46] Egypt by the power of that lamb the lamb
[53:50] was in their belly it gave strength to
[53:51] their limbs amen it caused them to walk
[53:53] out Amen in the morning right and it's
[53:55] the same thing with you and I it may
[53:57] sound contrary because I'm saying we're
[53:59] staying in Passover but we're walking at
[54:00] the same time right but you got to stay
[54:03] in fellowship with your lamb CU you see
[54:05] the things you eat are the things you
[54:07] become that's why that's why society's
[54:09] become so such a chaos it is today is
[54:12] because people have been living off amen
[54:14] the the cup of iniquity of the great
[54:17] not just religiously but
[54:19] entertainment wise remember there's Two
[54:21] Babylons one's in Rome one's in one's in
[54:24] Al they're both judged separate way you
[54:26] read Revelations 18 they're shown in two
[54:29] different things but you see the world
[54:30] has become drunk on those things and
[54:32] they have now embodied what has been
[54:34] dished out and I pray that we've be
[54:36] we've embodied what has been dished out
[54:39] amen by the message of the hour amen
[54:40] that we embody what a true Christian
[54:42] should be amen that Christian values
[54:44] should not be something we're trying to
[54:45] obtain to we see it living because of
[54:48] the power of the Lamb the life of the
[54:49] Lamb that's within
[54:50] us amen so
[54:54] now this would be a this would be thing
[54:56] that they had to stand now when you when
[54:59] you stand fellowship with the Lord
[55:01] there's a
[55:02] sweetness there is a joy there's a peace
[55:05] that passes all understanding right in
[55:08] spite of the worst situation in life you
[55:11] can have a joy and a peace that humanly
[55:13] makes no sense and it's not based on
[55:16] circumstance it's a condition that
[55:17] you're in because you're having
[55:18] communion with your God right you're
[55:21] feeding on the lamb I mean you're
[55:22] feeding on his word you're not you're
[55:24] not caught up in what's going on sure
[55:26] there's times we feel overwhelmed
[55:28] humanly right doesn't make doesn't mean
[55:30] we're just emotionally disconnected and
[55:31] that's how we know but there's a peace
[55:33] that when you really sit down you really
[55:35] think on the Lord and every in the
[55:36] situation you're in there's something
[55:38] that bubbles up who's with me on this I
[55:40] mean I trust you've all experienced this
[55:42] there's a peace that passes all
[55:44] understanding that's not about your your
[55:46] the condition you're in and it's because
[55:48] you're eating the lamb you're in
[55:49] communion as you're walking with God
[55:52] Amen you're staying under the blood
[55:54] having fellowship with our God
[55:58] amen praise the Lord
[56:00] now let's just let's just come down to
[56:03] this now I know I know there's a lot of
[56:05] many times people emphasize uh a phrase
[56:08] that brother Braham uses if you go study
[56:10] the token sermons he emphasizes this
[56:12] this phrase full obedience to the full
[56:14] word of God whole word of God entitles
[56:16] you to the Token right and then what
[56:19] happens is straight away is people now I
[56:20] may have said this before but I'm going
[56:22] to say it again now people what they do
[56:24] is they take the message and make it a
[56:25] checklist
[56:26] of things I must be obedient to but
[56:29] brother Bram never says that's what full
[56:31] obedience means no he because he says it
[56:33] here he says full obedience to the whole
[56:35] word of God to God's entire word will
[56:36] entitle you to this token how do you do
[56:38] it Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[56:40] repent every one of you and be baptized
[56:42] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[56:44] remission of sin and you shall receive
[56:45] the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[56:47] token amen so so to me that casts down
[56:50] every scarecrow because that's why fear
[56:52] Creeps in have I done enough am I doing
[56:55] enough
[56:56] and what happens is I I believe we're
[56:58] all sincere people we want to serve the
[57:00] Lord we want to closer walk with him
[57:02] where we are we're thankful for but we
[57:04] want more of him right so the devil
[57:06] plagues plagues us he uses our own
[57:09] sincerity against
[57:11] us amen so you see what happens is we
[57:14] begin to people begin to worry now have
[57:16] I done enough to make sure the blood is
[57:18] applied and the Death Angel can't get me
[57:21] well this is what you must do right
[57:24] because if you receive the Holy Ghost
[57:25] now the life in your lamb has come unto
[57:27] you and that life of the lamb now lives
[57:30] out of you right we know under the blood
[57:32] of bulls and goats there in there in
[57:34] Egypt there they could not the life of
[57:36] their sacrifice could not come in and
[57:38] change them because humans have souls
[57:40] animals do not have souls so the life in
[57:42] the lamb the nature of the Lamb could
[57:43] never come into them and make them lamb
[57:45] likee right that's why they had to
[57:46] continue to offer sacrifices and all
[57:48] these things it could not change them
[57:50] but when the Lord Jesus the true Lamb of
[57:52] God came I mean when he died on Calvary
[57:54] his blood was shed out of his body amen
[57:56] the life of that blood which is the Holy
[57:58] Ghost God's own life was now released
[58:00] Upon A people that whosoever believeth
[58:02] amen amen that that life now of your
[58:06] lamb your sacrifice comes into you and
[58:08] you receive God's nature amen amen and
[58:12] as you walk with him more and more what
[58:14] happens is your nature goes and his
[58:16] nature increases because really maturity
[58:19] in Christ is you see more of God in your
[58:21] life every day that's what maturity
[58:23] really is it's not even understanding
[58:24] all the Mysteries though we do know
[58:25] those things but that's not true
[58:27] maturity maturity is the life of the
[58:29] Lamb takes dominance over you am mean
[58:32] and the things that once toss you to and
[58:33] fro that don't toss you too too and
[58:35] throw anymore why because his life is
[58:37] having more
[58:38] preeminence amen aren't you glad I mean
[58:41] see see Christian you it's such a simple
[58:43] thing to be a Christian it's such a
[58:45] simple thing and and man does not like
[58:47] simple things we want great gadgets the
[58:50] greatest the best the furthest the
[58:52] fastest all these things but God says no
[58:54] it's not the shiny great things that
[58:55] people project is great no it's humble
[58:58] Meek Simplicity of
[59:01] God Amen so you see now if you've been
[59:04] if you've repented really repented and
[59:07] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[59:08] Christ for remission of sin you shall
[59:10] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[59:11] shall receive this token amen that that
[59:14] is full obedience to the word of God and
[59:16] if anyone puts any other scarecrows
[59:18] along your way forget it forget the
[59:21] Scarecrow amen because if you fully if
[59:23] you fully surrendered to the word of God
[59:25] his Spirit comes into you it'll start
[59:27] living out of you there'll be something
[59:29] that comes into you when you when you
[59:31] start to put a foot wrong God will say I
[59:32] don't want to do that I don't like that
[59:34] you shouldn't have done that and then
[59:35] what are you sorry
[59:37] Lord amen praise God aren't you glad he
[59:40] becomes the inside teacher I mean he can
[59:43] he he convicts you of sin when you've
[59:44] done wrong yes my Lord amen he guides
[59:47] you amen he doesn't he doesn't leave you
[59:49] but you see now the thing is we got to
[59:51] be careful what we eat I'm just coming
[59:52] back to that I I I said it earlier
[59:54] because Jesus would say
[59:56] Beware of the liven of which is the
[59:59] doctrine of the Pharisees scribes and
[1:00:00] Pharisees see the see the disciples
[1:00:03] thought he was talking about natural
[1:00:04] bread when he's saying beware of their
[1:00:05] leaven but he's saying no it's their
[1:00:07] Doctrine their teaching because what
[1:00:09] happens is the bread may look the same
[1:00:12] just like the word may look the same but
[1:00:14] what it produces will be very different
[1:00:17] you see this way he's saying
[1:00:19] beware beware their
[1:00:21] Doctrine because it will it will change
[1:00:24] your communion
[1:00:27] because he'd say because look at what it
[1:00:29] produces but all their Works they do to
[1:00:31] be seen of
[1:00:32] men now when when our lord Jesus was
[1:00:35] here he didn't go on promotion tours he
[1:00:38] didn't have a lot of adver the only
[1:00:40] advertising he had was was was people
[1:00:43] that he touched and it's amazing how
[1:00:45] many times he would say to people don't
[1:00:46] tell anyone about
[1:00:48] it he said no don't tell don't say
[1:00:50] anything but of course the person's just
[1:00:52] been delivered they've been set free how
[1:00:53] can they not well people said different
[1:00:55] what happened happened to you and they
[1:00:57] think he said not to say but I've got to
[1:00:59] say you see but he didn't he didn't
[1:01:01] publicize look how great I am look how
[1:01:04] awesome I am no he was the meek humble
[1:01:06] lowly man of Galilee but yet he was the
[1:01:09] Lord of creation and flesh he was God
[1:01:12] manifested In the Flesh he was the
[1:01:13] greatest one the greatest man that will
[1:01:15] ever walk upon the Earth as him amen the
[1:01:18] greatest one but yet he did not boast he
[1:01:21] didn't say this is how yeah I'm the
[1:01:22] greatest thing look at how great I am no
[1:01:25] there was no big shot in him he he
[1:01:27] didn't want to be the center of
[1:01:28] attention he wanted his father to be the
[1:01:30] center of attention even he'd say to his
[1:01:33] disciples it's not me that doeth the
[1:01:34] works it's the father that dwelleth in
[1:01:36] me doeth the works see so he didn't
[1:01:38] bring any he didn't he didn't try and
[1:01:40] get any praise for
[1:01:41] himself but you see but but you see cuz
[1:01:44] he was eating the right bread if I can
[1:01:46] put it that way he was having the right
[1:01:47] communion with his father am mean the
[1:01:49] same spirit that should be in you and I
[1:01:51] the Holy Ghost but you see now the Liv
[1:01:53] of the scribes of Pharisees they wanted
[1:01:55] to say look at how great I am look at
[1:01:58] how wonderful I am look at what I'm
[1:02:00] doing and it was all
[1:02:03] empty but all their Works they do to be
[1:02:05] seen of men they make broad their
[1:02:08] whatever that word is and you know
[1:02:10] basically they they make their clothes
[1:02:12] fancy to look great enlarge the borders
[1:02:14] of their garments and love the uttermost
[1:02:15] room at feasts and the chief seats in
[1:02:18] the synagogues the greetings in the
[1:02:20] markets to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi
[1:02:22] whomsoever shall exalt himself shall be
[1:02:24] a beast and he that himself himself
[1:02:27] shall be exalted you see so they really
[1:02:30] wanted worship this is what their Liv
[1:02:33] produced they wanted worship that's why
[1:02:37] what are greetings like this have the
[1:02:38] greatest part oh great Rabbi we're so
[1:02:40] glad you're here all these things they
[1:02:42] were looking for worship their leaven
[1:02:44] was the actually this is what the devil
[1:02:47] wants the leav was the wrong Le so there
[1:02:50] was no joy there was all they cared
[1:02:53] about was I want to be the biggest one
[1:02:55] the the smartest one the greatest one
[1:02:57] the deepest one all these things this is
[1:02:59] this is what they were striving to
[1:03:01] achieve but it didn't it didn't do them
[1:03:03] no good you see a woman at the well who
[1:03:07] was a Samaritan knew more of the
[1:03:10] scripture than them Legion knew more
[1:03:13] than them Peter James and John ignorant
[1:03:15] fishermen knew more than them you see
[1:03:18] and of course in those days a rabbi
[1:03:20] would just come and call his disciples
[1:03:22] and obviously Peter James and John they
[1:03:24] were passed over a long time ago that's
[1:03:26] why they weren't a disciple of anyone
[1:03:27] but Jesus said no you're my disciple
[1:03:30] hallelujah amen you see even this came
[1:03:32] into the galatian church you see they
[1:03:34] started off see um I love it how the
[1:03:37] Apostle Paul puts this here he says now
[1:03:41] this I'll just read from verse one oh
[1:03:42] foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[1:03:44] that you should not obey the truth uh
[1:03:47] before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[1:03:49] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:03:51] this only what I learn of you received
[1:03:53] ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or
[1:03:55] the hear ing of
[1:03:56] Faith are you so foolish having begun in
[1:03:59] the spirit you're now made perfect by
[1:04:01] the flesh see he's saying look you
[1:04:03] started this way but why have you gone
[1:04:05] off onto this that it's your own ability
[1:04:08] that will perfect you how did how did
[1:04:11] the Spirit come by the hearing of Faith
[1:04:13] so they started off in the right
[1:04:16] Passover but something was injected in
[1:04:19] that the sweetness and the joy and the
[1:04:20] victory Of God was gone and now became a
[1:04:24] self-focused self-centered walk of how
[1:04:26] am I doing am I doing enough this is
[1:04:28] what they were doing amen but the
[1:04:31] Apostle Paul said no no no I'm going to
[1:04:33] give you the right bread again because
[1:04:35] you're God's children you've gone off
[1:04:36] but I'm going to God's going to bring
[1:04:38] you back this is why I'm writing to you
[1:04:39] amen this is you know so so he'd say no
[1:04:42] you started this way but you've gone off
[1:04:44] he says uh this is verse five here he
[1:04:46] therefore that minister to you the
[1:04:48] spirit and worketh miracles among you do
[1:04:50] he do it by The Works of the law or by
[1:04:52] the hearing of Faith so he's saying no
[1:04:54] it's not by the work of the Lord God
[1:04:56] comes and manifest himself among you
[1:04:58] it's not your own ability and keeping
[1:04:59] the word in your own strength that's
[1:05:01] what I say it's got It's not a man-made
[1:05:03] fire that the Lamb's got to be roasted
[1:05:04] in it's got to be a holy ghost fire
[1:05:06] burning in the heart because if there's
[1:05:08] a holy ghost fire burning in the heart
[1:05:09] well you say how do I know I have that
[1:05:11] do you have a desire to please God to
[1:05:13] serve
[1:05:14] him the fire's on baby it's
[1:05:18] burning don't let it go over your head
[1:05:20] if you have a sincere desire remember
[1:05:22] brother Braham had an interview with a
[1:05:24] sister Bruce and God used used her in
[1:05:26] the body how how she was used she had a
[1:05:27] burden for prayer and different things
[1:05:29] and then you know and but and God has
[1:05:32] used her you can go through the message
[1:05:33] and see her life is recorded through the
[1:05:35] message not just that interview and
[1:05:37] God's been working with her working
[1:05:39] through and all these things and she
[1:05:41] comes to brother Braham saying I don't
[1:05:42] know if I have the Holy Ghost or not
[1:05:45] this is a question and and she is
[1:05:47] trusting the gift in his life is going
[1:05:48] to show him a vision that God will say
[1:05:51] actually at this moment this happened
[1:05:52] you've got it but brother Master um
[1:05:54] answers who her question with a simple
[1:05:56] question one day you're going this
[1:05:58] way now you're serving God you're going
[1:06:01] this way and he asked the question what
[1:06:04] did that and you can hear her say Christ
[1:06:06] and he says there it is see such a
[1:06:09] simple thing such a simple thing but
[1:06:12] he's saying you got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:13] sister Bruce God is using you in the
[1:06:15] body but your problem is the devil uses
[1:06:18] your own nature against
[1:06:21] you amen God built us all a certain way
[1:06:25] but we've got got to be say Lord we got
[1:06:27] to be very aware when the devil uses
[1:06:29] like if you're very melancholic you get
[1:06:30] down in the dumps you get blue and all
[1:06:32] these things so you built that way for
[1:06:34] God to use you a certain way but that's
[1:06:36] the devil using it against you right and
[1:06:39] there's all the other oh I don't have it
[1:06:42] on me but there's all the other
[1:06:42] different kind of personalities right
[1:06:44] God built you a certain way but you see
[1:06:45] it can be such a simple thing when God
[1:06:48] came and met you and changed your life
[1:06:49] but you got to stay in communion with
[1:06:51] your
[1:06:53] Lord amen if that's okay
[1:06:56] you
[1:06:56] see the the lamb gave them strength to
[1:07:00] go all the way to the promised
[1:07:02] land Moses would say to them if I can if
[1:07:05] I can find it he'd
[1:07:07] say he'd say that your shoes didn't wear
[1:07:10] out see this is verse 5 here I've LED
[1:07:13] you 40 years in the wilderness your
[1:07:16] clothes are not wax and old upon you and
[1:07:17] your shoes are not wax and old upon thy
[1:07:19] foot so the clothing that they dressed
[1:07:22] in when they left Egypt was still just
[1:07:25] as strong wasn't worn out wasn't damaged
[1:07:28] remember they they didn't they didn't
[1:07:30] walk up a nice sidewalk they didn't walk
[1:07:32] on nice green grass everything's nice
[1:07:34] they went through desert conditions they
[1:07:36] went through hard conditions but God was
[1:07:38] saying your your natural clothing is not
[1:07:40] worn out amen from the day you left
[1:07:42] Egypt to the day you are today I say if
[1:07:44] you're in Passover if you your if God
[1:07:47] has met you the blood the Holy Ghost has
[1:07:48] been applied to your life amen the
[1:07:50] Garment you're wearing to leave won't
[1:07:52] can't wear out amen the the
[1:07:54] righteousness of the saint amen it
[1:07:56] doesn't wear out it doesn't get old you
[1:07:57] don't need to change it amen but you're
[1:07:59] dressed and ready to leave amen but you
[1:08:02] see they had to realize they had 40
[1:08:04] years they didn't even realize really
[1:08:05] what had happened he says God has not
[1:08:07] shown you until this day do I have that
[1:08:10] with me no it's not there but you go
[1:08:12] read Deuteronomy 29 he says God has not
[1:08:14] given you a heart to oh there it is no
[1:08:16] yeah verse four yet the Lord has not
[1:08:19] given you a heart to perceive eyes to
[1:08:20] see and ears to hear until this day they
[1:08:22] didn't fully grasp what was what what
[1:08:24] had happened that's amazing they went
[1:08:26] all the way through it but they didn't
[1:08:27] grasp what had happened let the T on the
[1:08:30] way to Aus they living in the greatest
[1:08:31] week of History the death Buri
[1:08:33] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:35] they walked with the resurrected Messiah
[1:08:37] for 6 hours and he was opening the word
[1:08:39] breaking the bread to them feeding them
[1:08:41] amen hallelujah they were in Passover
[1:08:43] communion with their lord and they and
[1:08:45] they went there and he broke the bread
[1:08:47] in the house and their eyes came open
[1:08:49] amen because they did not have a heart
[1:08:51] to perceive or eyes to see for that
[1:08:53] 6-hour journey of a sermon of fulfilled
[1:08:55] prophet prophecy but God stayed with
[1:08:57] them just like he stayed with them amen
[1:08:59] till finally their eyes came open and
[1:09:01] they realized they're part of the vision
[1:09:03] God has delivered them and they're
[1:09:04] fulfilling prophecy and God's fulfilling
[1:09:07] prophecy in their lives amen hallelujah
[1:09:11] see you see now I believe this is the
[1:09:13] hour where really our our our hearts God
[1:09:15] has opened our hearts to fully perceive
[1:09:18] we're safe under the blood amen he's
[1:09:21] given us eyes of understanding they
[1:09:23] realize no the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:09:25] more than enough it's not equal it's not
[1:09:28] just it's more than enough amen the
[1:09:32] Simplicity of the power of the blood
[1:09:34] amen and how you know how the how the
[1:09:36] life in that blood because because we
[1:09:38] know the chemistry of that blood is gone
[1:09:40] even if I had even if this was I know
[1:09:42] this is not this is olive oil but if
[1:09:44] this was the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:09:47] would be a very sacred thing but it
[1:09:50] wouldn't do me any good now that may
[1:09:53] sound funny but if I if I poured his
[1:09:56] physical blood upon me that would give
[1:09:58] me an emotional experience but it
[1:10:00] wouldn't actually change me it has to be
[1:10:02] the life of the blood has to come into
[1:10:04] me and change me right that is the most
[1:10:07] important thing is when his life comes
[1:10:10] into you that shows that you're one with
[1:10:12] your sacrifice amen so now we can say
[1:10:15] the life of the blood the Holy Ghost
[1:10:16] comes into
[1:10:17] church amen we say we have the blood of
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ because of the spirit of
[1:10:21] the blood amen comes into church comes
[1:10:24] and dwells in the believer amen comes
[1:10:26] and washes us white as snow hallelujah
[1:10:30] amen Keeps Us in communion Keeps Us in
[1:10:31] Fellowship Keeps Us in the way walking
[1:10:34] with him amen praise the Lord but you
[1:10:36] see now this blood is the greatest
[1:10:38] barrier the Holy Ghost is the greatest
[1:10:41] barrier that's in existence nothing can
[1:10:43] pass through it nothing can get through
[1:10:45] it you say well what about Eve I say no
[1:10:48] Eve was God allowed that to happen for
[1:10:51] the fall to come right but he had to
[1:10:53] have his Plan of Redemption lived out
[1:10:56] right so now the people who are the
[1:10:57] beneficiaries of
[1:10:59] redemption amen God makes us in
[1:11:02] condition that we cannot
[1:11:05] fall we'll be tested we'll be tried
[1:11:08] we'll be tempted amen but the devil will
[1:11:11] never re over our lives like he caused
[1:11:14] it like he caused with Adam and Eve
[1:11:16] because of the blood that because of the
[1:11:18] protection that we're under amen he may
[1:11:20] bombard you day after day but he can't
[1:11:22] get you amen because remember I think it
[1:11:24] says in the Book of Job that a man will
[1:11:25] become a hiding place amen and our and
[1:11:29] our God is our Hiding Place amen he's
[1:11:31] our Strong Tower amen but we've got to
[1:11:33] have full complete confidence in his
[1:11:36] blood see we we are living in a day
[1:11:39] where the revelation of the power of the
[1:11:41] blood is more than enough is here it's
[1:11:43] not the blood and your own Good
[1:11:45] Conduct right we believe in Good Conduct
[1:11:48] we believe in Christian Living we
[1:11:50] believe in being honest right we believe
[1:11:51] in forgiving we believe in being sincere
[1:11:53] and genuine and right we We Believe
[1:11:55] those things don't we cuz we live it out
[1:11:58] right we well we let God live it out of
[1:11:59] us right but you see in former ages it
[1:12:01] was it was the blood and your own Good
[1:12:03] Conduct entitled you to Salvation or
[1:12:06] right but it is not that it is the blood
[1:12:08] alone when Paul wrote that we're saved
[1:12:11] amen it's let's let's just go to uh
[1:12:13] Ephesians chapter 2 now you think about
[1:12:15] this man that would write these you know
[1:12:18] God would give these Revelations too he
[1:12:20] was a Pharisee of the Pharisees the
[1:12:22] Pharisees added hundreds of laws on top
[1:12:25] the law of Moses and he was a Pharisee
[1:12:27] of the Pharisees basically saying I'm a
[1:12:29] good
[1:12:30] Pharisee I'm not all talk I really did
[1:12:32] it but then here' come so I don't have
[1:12:33] it up there but can you can you can you
[1:12:36] go to um tal can you just uh jump over
[1:12:39] to Ephesians chapter
[1:12:41] 2 and then he would
[1:12:45] um amen and and I would just like verse
[1:12:48] verse eight now this these kind of
[1:12:50] scriptures are not Baptist scriptures
[1:12:53] they are not just some confession of
[1:12:55] Faith this is bride scripture am mean
[1:12:57] because it's by Grace you are saved
[1:12:59] through faith and not of yourselves it
[1:13:01] is the gift of God just like Moses
[1:13:03] instructions that the so the death angel
[1:13:05] would not strike the Israelites in Egypt
[1:13:07] that was a gift of God that wasn't their
[1:13:09] own selves working it out and their own
[1:13:11] no God said this is how you're going to
[1:13:12] be safe when death strikes this land
[1:13:14] amen and same same thing we are saved by
[1:13:16] gra through grace through faith amen so
[1:13:18] God gives you Faith amen his grace comes
[1:13:21] into your life and it delivers us amen
[1:13:23] and is not of ourselves it's not your
[1:13:25] Good Conduct how many people I've spoken
[1:13:27] to they say well basically their their
[1:13:29] whole argument of why they're not a
[1:13:31] Christian is I'm not good
[1:13:33] enough that has nothing to do with it I
[1:13:37] me I remember you know before I met the
[1:13:38] Lord I was on this roller coaster
[1:13:40] because I had it in my mind hopefully I
[1:13:42] say this the right right way round the
[1:13:45] devil had it had me under this cloud of
[1:13:47] if I'm good enough for long enough I'll
[1:13:50] get the Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost no it is not you am it if you get
[1:13:58] your eyes off you and get your eyes on
[1:14:00] your lamb then you'll get the benefits
[1:14:03] of the Lamb amen you get the life of the
[1:14:05] Lamb the power of the Lamb the
[1:14:06] overcoming nature of the lamb but if
[1:14:08] your eyes are upon you even in your
[1:14:10] Christian Journey then you're going to
[1:14:11] be you're going to be disappointed
[1:14:14] because you're looking at you right but
[1:14:16] if you just look at the power of the
[1:14:17] Lamb you see so so I had that in my mind
[1:14:19] if I'm good enough for long enough and
[1:14:21] then of course I was never good enough
[1:14:22] for long
[1:14:23] enough but when came to a place of full
[1:14:26] surrender amen that's when he stepped
[1:14:30] in we we all got to come to the end of
[1:14:33] ourselves sometimes it can take decades
[1:14:35] sometimes it doesn't take that long but
[1:14:37] we all got to come to that point where I
[1:14:38] say I can't do this lord I can't be a
[1:14:40] Christian Lord I cannot I cannot do it
[1:14:43] you've got to help me Lord and he just
[1:14:45] stands there saying I've been waiting
[1:14:46] for you to do that Hallelujah because
[1:14:48] he's a gentleman he doesn't force
[1:14:49] himself upon anyone so we're save so so
[1:14:52] here was the Pharisee of the Pharisees
[1:14:53] and he would receive this Revelation for
[1:14:55] by Grace you are saved through faith and
[1:14:57] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:14:59] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:15:01] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:15:03] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[1:15:06] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:15:07] in
[1:15:09] them so it's not nothing but the blood
[1:15:11] in your own works or nothing but the
[1:15:13] blood of my own Good Conduct no it's
[1:15:15] nothing but the blood of
[1:15:18] Jesus what does that mean I just get all
[1:15:20] LAX and loose no if God ever reveals for
[1:15:25] you what he did for you on
[1:15:27] Calvary if he ever does it it changes
[1:15:30] your whole world it changes your whole
[1:15:32] nature it changes your whole desires it
[1:15:35] changes your whole life you cannot
[1:15:37] remain the same amen if it's just a
[1:15:40] story well it's just a story I remember
[1:15:42] in my own life when it was just a story
[1:15:44] but when his love was shed abroad My
[1:15:45] Heart by his holy ghost I realized how
[1:15:48] much he loved me because he died me on
[1:15:49] Calvary and how much I love him because
[1:15:51] of it amen now so I feel like we're
[1:15:54] running out of time here you say well
[1:15:56] how can we walk and how can we how can
[1:15:58] we uh be in Passover at the same time
[1:16:01] well well David would say thou H has
[1:16:02] prepared a table before me in the
[1:16:04] presence of my enemies thou anointeth my
[1:16:06] head with oil and my cup runneth over so
[1:16:08] David knew what it was like to stay in
[1:16:10] Passover stay in communion amen with God
[1:16:14] hallelujah and this caused a certain
[1:16:15] effect in his life what his cup runs
[1:16:18] over and he was amen and he was
[1:16:21] anointed praise the Lord the Galatians
[1:16:23] started this way but they went off into
[1:16:25] their own ability then God brought them
[1:16:26] back amen hope this is okay this morning
[1:16:30] amen now remember the life I'm just
[1:16:32] going to read a bit of this here now
[1:16:34] well let's let's actually jump up here
[1:16:36] because a picture uh is a thousand words
[1:16:39] now I just found this I like I like
[1:16:40] emotion in pictures now here is the now
[1:16:42] I don't know if exactly this way with
[1:16:44] the eldest son holding the Basin of
[1:16:46] blood you know we know the father would
[1:16:47] have applied the blood to the house and
[1:16:50] uh yeah and there's maybe the mom there
[1:16:52] with the lamp and all these things but
[1:16:54] to me
[1:16:55] to me this embodies the whole thing now
[1:16:58] we are all the head of the house
[1:17:00] individually right you've all got to
[1:17:03] apply the blood let the blood be applied
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost come into your life
[1:17:06] yourself there's an individual Affair
[1:17:08] between you and God okay but you see you
[1:17:10] have here now the the father has heard
[1:17:13] the word of Moses he says amen I believe
[1:17:16] that we're leaving let's get ready amen
[1:17:19] we've been here long enough slavery is
[1:17:20] over we're going out amen so he takes
[1:17:23] the lamb he kills the lamb they've
[1:17:24] already roasted it you know they uh you
[1:17:26] know it's ready and they take the blood
[1:17:28] as that's going on and then he applies
[1:17:30] the blood to the the the lintle in the
[1:17:33] two side posts of the of the door
[1:17:35] showing now that the that the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] should not just be applied to your flesh
[1:17:39] or applied to your spirit it's got to be
[1:17:41] applied to your soul it's got to be in
[1:17:43] all of you not just anoint you not just
[1:17:45] heal your body but it's got to dwell in
[1:17:46] your soul amen and now there's the
[1:17:49] there's the mom she's she's thrilled
[1:17:51] look at the smile on her face praise God
[1:17:54] God's taking us out of here but you see
[1:17:56] the oldest son he's he's not so
[1:17:58] sure what's really going on Dad I don't
[1:18:01] really understand now you see if you
[1:18:03] have that kind of expression the reason
[1:18:05] she is happy and and the son is
[1:18:07] concerned maybe one CU he's the son
[1:18:09] death can strike him but too she has a
[1:18:11] revelation like her husband does we're
[1:18:15] safe we're the the blood is being
[1:18:17] applied we're safe but he's not so sure
[1:18:20] about it and you see it's when you're
[1:18:22] not so sure and and the reason he
[1:18:24] wouldn't be so sure is because he
[1:18:27] doesn't have the full confidence in the
[1:18:29] word through the prophet and the
[1:18:30] applying of that word in the life right
[1:18:34] but you see and and that's where
[1:18:35] pressure builds up because he begins to
[1:18:37] get worried have we done enough my life
[1:18:40] is on the line what's going to happen to
[1:18:42] me is this really going to work that's
[1:18:44] where pressure builds up that's where
[1:18:46] the focus goes from the blood to
[1:18:49] yourself who's following me on the S
[1:18:52] right you see so so there's pressure now
[1:18:53] on him because he's the eldest he can
[1:18:56] die you know his life is in Jeopardy and
[1:18:58] when we really become sober enough we
[1:18:59] realize our lives are in Jeopardy we got
[1:19:02] to be sure that our Eternal destination
[1:19:03] is
[1:19:05] secure right so so then now you know
[1:19:08] after this all done they're in the house
[1:19:10] they're having the Passover feast there
[1:19:12] the unliving bread and the and the lamb
[1:19:14] burnt with bitter herbs they eating this
[1:19:16] but you know no doubt the father and the
[1:19:18] mother they're just they're happy
[1:19:21] they're thankful they're rejoicing maybe
[1:19:24] it's a sober time but it's a thankful
[1:19:25] time you know sometimes you know when
[1:19:27] God really affects me I get real
[1:19:29] quiet because the magnitude of what he's
[1:19:32] done become so real and maybe it's like
[1:19:36] that they're eating maybe tears are
[1:19:37] going down their cheeks but you know
[1:19:39] he's you know the sun is all antsy he's
[1:19:42] getting stressed he's worried because
[1:19:44] you know what's going to happen to me
[1:19:45] and is this really going to work and
[1:19:46] then eventually he can't take it anymore
[1:19:48] as he hears maybe there's a there's a
[1:19:50] sound on the outside the death angel has
[1:19:52] come down into come down into Egypt and
[1:19:54] he hears maybe a few a few houses up the
[1:19:57] street where maybe an Egyptian family
[1:19:59] lives maybe a family just didn't apply
[1:20:01] the blood and they hear a scream and
[1:20:02] it's a Mourning and begins to sweep
[1:20:04] through the land because there was a
[1:20:05] great cry that that night the Bible says
[1:20:07] there's never been a cry like it you
[1:20:09] know and then and then and and then that
[1:20:10] cry is getting maybe closer to where he
[1:20:12] lives and he just can't take anyone says
[1:20:15] Dad do you hear what happened you hear
[1:20:18] Little Johnny's dead I can hear his
[1:20:20] parents crying what about us are we
[1:20:23] going to be okay
[1:20:25] and he'd say and then his father cuz he
[1:20:27] got a revelation come here
[1:20:30] son see what we're
[1:20:32] reading this is Jehovah's lamb God's
[1:20:35] provided a lamb for us son you held the
[1:20:38] Basin of blood son you saw me apply the
[1:20:41] blood that's what the prophet told us
[1:20:43] he's got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah
[1:20:47] you hear those cries son they can't come
[1:20:49] into this house they can't come here
[1:20:52] son why dad is it cuz we're good enough
[1:20:54] is it because we're Abraham's Our Father
[1:20:56] no son it's because of this lamb that's
[1:21:00] why your mom's so happy son that's why
[1:21:03] I've got peace just let off the pressure
[1:21:06] son let off the pressure don't be
[1:21:09] stressed about your walk anymore don't
[1:21:12] be so burdened about if you're good
[1:21:13] enough for long enough and am I really
[1:21:15] going to make it let off the pressure I
[1:21:17] mean God has provided a perfect lamb
[1:21:19] it's not a denominational lamb it's not
[1:21:21] a lamb of man's ideas no it's a lamb of
[1:21:23] God the pure word of God Amen has been
[1:21:26] has been sacrificed on our behalf and
[1:21:28] we've applied the blood you can let off
[1:21:31] the precious son you can relax am me
[1:21:33] when death is striking the world you can
[1:21:35] relax and be at peace son because this
[1:21:38] is a sign that blood because he said
[1:21:40] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:21:44] Dad are you
[1:21:45] sure but what if there's a gap there
[1:21:47] ain't a gap son there ain't a gap the
[1:21:51] blood's covered us he can't get inside
[1:21:54] let off the pressure I'll say this to
[1:21:58] you let off the pressure stop putting
[1:22:01] the burden on yourself to fulfill the
[1:22:03] word of God let God be the Christian in
[1:22:06] you let him mold you and change you let
[1:22:10] just stay in Passover with your lamb
[1:22:12] don't eat all this bread that makes the
[1:22:15] pressure be on
[1:22:16] you amen amen let off the pressure you
[1:22:20] say am I accepted was their blood
[1:22:23] accepted
[1:22:25] is our lamb has he not been accepted
[1:22:29] well how do you know he's been accepted
[1:22:31] he rose one of my favorite scenes in the
[1:22:33] whole Bible Mary goes to the tomb thinks
[1:22:35] he's a gardener he calls it by name
[1:22:39] hallelujah amen all of her despair
[1:22:41] turned to Joy and Elation he's alive but
[1:22:44] but but but he says don't touch me yet I
[1:22:46] haven't ascended I'm going to ascend to
[1:22:48] my God and your God my father and your
[1:22:50] father Hallelujah so what he took his
[1:22:53] blood up into into Glory it was accepted
[1:22:56] why because the Holy Ghost was poured
[1:22:58] out on the day of Pentecost that's the
[1:23:00] proof that the blood was accepted
[1:23:02] because none other blood could cleanse a
[1:23:04] human soul that God himself could
[1:23:05] Tabernacle in that person am mean so his
[1:23:08] blood was accepted and it was proved
[1:23:10] because the Holy Ghost was poured out on
[1:23:11] the day of Pentecost and I'll say that
[1:23:13] same Holy Ghost is poured out in 2024
[1:23:17] amen proving amen the blood still works
[1:23:19] amen the blood is still there amen we
[1:23:21] still have a Living Sacrifice a living
[1:23:24] ad
[1:23:25] Jesus Christ the righteous
[1:23:28] hallelujah hallelujah amen so we can let
[1:23:31] off the pressure he say what about my
[1:23:34] family God gave you a revelation for
[1:23:37] you you pray till that Revelation is for
[1:23:40] them and then you can walk in confidence
[1:23:43] you see I think brother Greg brought it
[1:23:45] up about the fears that job had came
[1:23:46] upon
[1:23:47] him he applied the blood and praise God
[1:23:51] he did but he's doing it out of fear we
[1:23:54] should not be Christians out of fear we
[1:23:57] should be Christians out of love
[1:23:59] thankfulness and
[1:24:00] Faith amen remember because he did not
[1:24:04] call you to lose you he saved you to
[1:24:07] keep you amen and so just stay and
[1:24:11] Passover with your lamb stay under the
[1:24:15] blood you say well how do I do that job
[1:24:18] had the great challenge of his life I'm
[1:24:20] I'm skipping a lot of things here but
[1:24:22] job had a great challenge of his life
[1:24:23] now if I can find this
[1:24:25] here where his friends would come and
[1:24:27] say you're a secret sinner you've done
[1:24:29] this you've done that but he he knew
[1:24:32] that he was righteous not because of his
[1:24:35] what he has
[1:24:37] done but because he stayed under the
[1:24:40] blood he had full confidence in the lamb
[1:24:43] that he
[1:24:44] offered that's how he stayed under the
[1:24:46] blood he didn't try and inject his own
[1:24:49] self into his
[1:24:51] salvation I know this is simple but
[1:24:53] Christianity
[1:24:56] simple we got to have full confidence in
[1:24:58] our lamp job
[1:25:00] did and God gave him a revelation of the
[1:25:03] Resurrection that he was part of it now
[1:25:05] I know my redeemer liveth he didn't
[1:25:07] understand what was going on in his life
[1:25:09] God didn't come before the time and say
[1:25:10] now Satan's going to come this is going
[1:25:12] to happen your friends are going to come
[1:25:14] they're going to say this this no he
[1:25:16] didn't say any of those things but job
[1:25:18] could stand staying under the blood
[1:25:21] because he had full confidence in that
[1:25:22] blood
[1:25:24] how about you we've had a lot of curve
[1:25:27] life is full of
[1:25:28] curveballs
[1:25:30] right but what do we do when we don't
[1:25:33] understand what's going on we stay under
[1:25:34] the blood by having full confidence in
[1:25:36] our
[1:25:39] lamb
[1:25:41] amen amen I was going to find a find a
[1:25:45] place to get off and then we can we can
[1:25:47] Rejoice a little bit you
[1:25:50] know we take things because some people
[1:25:53] don't like simplistic
[1:25:55] I'm not saying you don't but some people
[1:25:56] like complicated things I like simple
[1:25:59] things you say well you studied science
[1:26:01] and worked in science I like simple
[1:26:03] things I like simple things does it work
[1:26:05] yes good okay let's do it it's simple
[1:26:09] right now we believe in the power of the
[1:26:12] blood for the forgiveness of sin do we
[1:26:14] not we believe that our sins are not
[1:26:17] just covered by the blood of Jesus
[1:26:19] Christ they're gone right you got to
[1:26:22] realize the power of genuine
[1:26:24] confession brother Bram would have a uh
[1:26:27] brother Tim PR he um I don't know if um
[1:26:30] he has a sister in his church who was a
[1:26:32] young teenage girl there in brother
[1:26:34] Brown's meetings now I know I've shared
[1:26:36] this before but I just want to tell you
[1:26:37] the power of confession the power of
[1:26:39] this Blood she was in the prayer line
[1:26:42] teenage girl and and and her parents
[1:26:44] were in the audience there they came to
[1:26:45] church together she was in the prayer
[1:26:47] line she was secretly smoking and hiding
[1:26:49] it from her
[1:26:51] parents and then now I think two people
[1:26:53] in front of her a man standing before
[1:26:55] the prophet and the angel of the Lord of
[1:26:57] course is there and and God is
[1:26:59] Discerning through the prophet what's
[1:27:00] going on in his life he says you're a
[1:27:02] smoker and um and then so she hears this
[1:27:05] and then she starts panicking because
[1:27:08] she realizes when she stands in that
[1:27:10] presence nothing is hid from God
[1:27:12] nothing's hid from God and God's going
[1:27:14] to call out that she's smoking secretly
[1:27:16] lying to her parents about it and so she
[1:27:18] starts repenting in her heart she starts
[1:27:21] calling on God say God I'm sorry I'm
[1:27:23] wrong forgive me of the sin Lord then
[1:27:26] she stands in front of the Prophet
[1:27:28] there's no mention of it why because if
[1:27:31] if Sinners confess a genuine confession
[1:27:34] into the blood of Jesus Christ God don't
[1:27:36] see it God don't see it you may remember
[1:27:39] it but God don't see it amen so that's
[1:27:42] that is the power of this Blood a
[1:27:44] genuine confession well do I have to
[1:27:45] have tears do I have to scream I shout
[1:27:47] no what's your heart say what's the
[1:27:49] genuiness of your heart right when you
[1:27:52] sincerely say Lord forgive me for this
[1:27:54] I've done this it's dipped into the
[1:27:56] blood of Jesus Christ God don't see it
[1:27:59] no
[1:27:59] more amen God don't see it no more he
[1:28:02] don't remember it no more that is the
[1:28:04] power of this Blood of this lamb that we
[1:28:07] have now so if it if it is that powerful
[1:28:09] just for confession of sin then can it
[1:28:12] not keep the devil
[1:28:14] away see he may punch at you he may
[1:28:16] tempt you trial different things but can
[1:28:18] it not I know I'm repeating myself but I
[1:28:20] just want to emphasize this can it not
[1:28:22] protect you for your your worldly your
[1:28:25] Earthly Journey can I not protect your
[1:28:28] house can I not keep you
[1:28:31] from all the you know the devil's
[1:28:35] devices can it not can we not have full
[1:28:39] confidence that the blood is more than
[1:28:41] enough for us amen oh but I've got to be
[1:28:44] good I've got to do this no you just got
[1:28:46] to have full confidence in your lamb
[1:28:48] because when you do it'll change you not
[1:28:50] just the situ it'll change you amen
[1:28:55] praise the Lord let's just finish with
[1:28:57] this oh let's just go here you see
[1:28:59] because because that Death Angel could
[1:29:01] not come into a house where the blood
[1:29:02] was right so it's just like that that
[1:29:05] spiritual death that's riding the land
[1:29:06] now it may come to other people but
[1:29:08] there's something different in you is
[1:29:10] the strong man of the house and there's
[1:29:12] no one stronger than our God there's no
[1:29:15] one stronger than our God and he can't
[1:29:17] even be wrestled with by the devil and
[1:29:19] the devil can't even nearly get him no
[1:29:21] the devil's
[1:29:22] defeated now I'm not saying things
[1:29:24] flippantly I'm trying to tell you our
[1:29:26] God is far greater than any circumstance
[1:29:28] any enemy anything right but we got to
[1:29:30] stay sincerely and Passover rejoicing in
[1:29:33] the lamb trusting in our God more than
[1:29:36] anything amen so he says about the
[1:29:38] strong man if he you know everything saf
[1:29:40] but if a stronger man comes in and
[1:29:41] overcomes and then all all his armor and
[1:29:43] things he trusted is divided and he and
[1:29:45] he divideth the spoils right but our God
[1:29:48] is the strongest man so if he's on the
[1:29:50] inside if that token of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] is on the inside the devil can't get you
[1:29:56] amen but now what is what is the world
[1:29:59] looking
[1:30:00] for oh wait let's just go here now when
[1:30:02] God puts a seal upon a man and the seal
[1:30:04] is the Holy Ghost uh when his when he
[1:30:06] seals a man like that he's gone to his
[1:30:08] eternal destination no no one ever can
[1:30:11] he ever ever go back anymore cuz
[1:30:13] remember Ephesians 4:30 grieve you not
[1:30:14] the Holy Ghost of God whereby you're
[1:30:16] sealed uh for all times the time of your
[1:30:19] destination see you're sealed forever
[1:30:20] you are sealed eternally into the
[1:30:22] kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit now
[1:30:24] think of that then you the devil will
[1:30:26] punch at you he'll say everything to you
[1:30:28] and accuse you and try to make you think
[1:30:30] that you're not but don't you listen to
[1:30:33] them remember you were there when it
[1:30:35] happened
[1:30:38] amen amen we're just going to finish
[1:30:40] with this and the musicians can come now
[1:30:42] what the world is looking for just a
[1:30:44] moment is to see some display not of
[1:30:47] shouting that's all right I believe in
[1:30:48] that not of speaking in tongues now
[1:30:50] that's all right I believe in that it's
[1:30:51] in its place I believe in the whole
[1:30:53] Bible not some Mir of healing I believe
[1:30:54] in that every bit of it what the world
[1:30:56] is looking for is to see some real
[1:30:58] Christianity some real life that you
[1:31:01] live out on the street wherever you are
[1:31:03] sealed with the power of God with the
[1:31:04] glory of God not running down the street
[1:31:06] hollering hallelujah hallelujah that
[1:31:08] isn't it but a sweet humble Christian
[1:31:10] walk before men Living the Life acting
[1:31:12] like a Christian being like a Christian
[1:31:14] behaving yourself like a Christian
[1:31:16] that's what the world's wanting to see
[1:31:18] and people will go down the street and
[1:31:19] say if there ever was a Christian a
[1:31:21] sainted person there she goes or there
[1:31:23] he goes but you see what we've done you
[1:31:26] know it's the truth friend that's what
[1:31:28] the world's looking
[1:31:29] for well how do I say that stay in
[1:31:32] communion with your lamb stay in
[1:31:35] Passover amen because
[1:31:39] they sorry I know I've said one more but
[1:31:41] I just want to say this one
[1:31:45] more Moses tells the children of Israel
[1:31:47] to keep the Passover every year and then
[1:31:50] there'll come a time when that when your
[1:31:52] children shall say unto you why mean you
[1:31:54] by this service so in other words it
[1:31:56] should be questioned why do we live like
[1:31:58] this mom why do we live like this
[1:32:01] Dad this is really I mean to me this is
[1:32:04] what the children should be asking then
[1:32:06] you shall say it is the sacrifice of the
[1:32:08] Lord's Passover amen who passed over the
[1:32:10] houses of of the children of Israel in
[1:32:12] Egypt when he smot the Egyptians and
[1:32:13] delivered our houses and the people
[1:32:15] bowed the head and worshiped so there
[1:32:18] should be a question why are we this way
[1:32:21] well it's simple because we've got a
[1:32:22] lamb we've got the Lamb of God he's in
[1:32:25] our house this is why we live this way
[1:32:27] this is why we're Christians because his
[1:32:29] blood has been applied amen we're
[1:32:32] dressed ready to leave this
[1:32:34] world Amen and when that comes in you
[1:32:36] can say well I remember the time I was a
[1:32:39] slave amen I remember the time I was a
[1:32:41] slave those those task Masters were
[1:32:43] cruel those Egyptians were cruel those
[1:32:45] Spirits were cruel then God sent his
[1:32:47] word amen delivered me he says just get
[1:32:50] under the blood the death angel can't
[1:32:52] strike you you're safe and and daughters
