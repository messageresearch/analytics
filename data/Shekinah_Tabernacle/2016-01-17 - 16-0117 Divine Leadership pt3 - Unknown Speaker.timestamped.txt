[41:52] here so
[41:54] 26-37 of of Luke chapter
[41:59] 17 and as it
[42:02] was and as it was in the days of Noah so
[42:05] shall it be also in the days of the son
[42:06] of man they did eat they drank they
[42:09] married wives they were given a marriage
[42:10] until the day that Noah entered into the
[42:12] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[42:13] them all likewise also as it was in the
[42:16] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[42:18] bought they sold they planted they build
[42:20] it but the same day that lot went out of
[42:22] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[42:24] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[42:26] shall it be in the day when the son of
[42:28] man is revealed and that day he which
[42:30] shall be upon the Housetop and a stuff
[42:32] in the house let him not come down to
[42:34] take it away and he that is in the field
[42:36] let him likewise not return back
[42:38] remember Lot's wife uh whosoever shall
[42:42] seek to save his life shall lose it and
[42:44] whosoever shall lose his life shall
[42:45] preserve it I tell you in that in that
[42:49] night there shall be two men in one bed
[42:51] one shall be taken the other shall be
[42:53] left two women shall be grinding
[42:54] together one shall be taken and the
[42:56] other left two men shall be in the field
[42:58] one shall be taken and the other left
[43:01] and they answered and uh and they
[43:02] answered and said unto him where Lord
[43:04] and he said unto him wheresoever the
[43:06] body is uh thither will the Eagles be
[43:10] gathered together amen let's just bow
[43:12] our heads in word of
[43:14] prayer gracious father gracious Heavenly
[43:16] Father we just want to Lord I'm so glad
[43:19] we can say Our Father which are in
[43:20] heaven Hallowed be thy name Lord we're
[43:23] so glad that you've revealed to us that
[43:24] you're our father Lord spirits come into
[43:26] us where I we cry Abba Father my father
[43:29] my father and Lord we want to thank you
[43:31] we can truly say we are amazed that you
[43:33] love us Lord we're amazed that you care
[43:35] Lord we're so glad you you've washed all
[43:37] our sins away Lord we're not stumbling
[43:40] blind in this world but we see where we
[43:41] are Lord we see where we're going we see
[43:43] who we are father we want to thank you
[43:45] for that privilege Lord just to walk
[43:47] with you Lord to feel our hand in yours
[43:49] Lord every day father what a privilege
[43:51] it is Lord and dear God we just pray as
[43:54] we have assembled One More Time Lord I
[43:56] pray you'd come one more time father
[43:58] speak to our hearts Lord may we walk out
[44:00] different Lord may you be the preacher
[44:03] this morning oh God take your word and
[44:04] make it live in front of us Lord I pray
[44:07] father may you give us receptive Hearts
[44:08] attentive AO Lord I pray as well father
[44:11] I pray you bless those who are not here
[44:13] Lord be with them Lord I pray they would
[44:15] Lord you'd gather Lord them Lord to
[44:17] yourself father may they have a little
[44:18] time together and may you just be there
[44:20] as well oh god father we want to commit
[44:22] the service into your hands may you have
[44:24] your way please and in Jesus Christ's
[44:27] name amen amen God bless you you may be
[44:33] seated so I want to I want to continue
[44:35] in my thought of of of divine leadership
[44:38] and you may think well that's kind of a
[44:40] unusual text to be reading but we
[44:43] understand that uh you know there is a I
[44:47] want to look into God's leadership in
[44:49] times that Jesus said it would be like
[44:52] when the son of man is revealed so uh so
[44:55] this morning morning I might not even
[44:56] really get into the subject I maybe want
[44:58] to lay a
[44:59] foundation but you see it's important
[45:02] see Jesus in the scripture he was laying
[45:04] out as it was the days of lot as it was
[45:07] the days of Noah so shall it be when the
[45:08] son of man is revealed so you might this
[45:11] may be very foundational to many people
[45:14] but it's very important because he says
[45:15] when you see these conditions upon the
[45:17] Earth then this is a time when I'm going
[45:19] to be revealed and we understand that
[45:22] how the True Believers you know it's
[45:24] important because the same conditions
[45:27] that Noah faced and the same conditions
[45:29] that Abraham and Sarah faced they have
[45:32] come right back around again and we're
[45:33] living in those days again and so if
[45:37] that is true then how the True Believer
[45:39] will be led will be the same today how
[45:43] the make believer acted will be how they
[45:45] act today and how the unbelievers ACT
[45:48] then will be how they act today so you
[45:50] see the same story just repeats itself
[45:52] it's just different people but so so how
[45:54] Abraham and Noah and Sarah were LED will
[45:57] be the same way the Believers LED today
[45:59] how the unbeliever hang around the
[46:01] believer then will be the same way they
[46:03] hang around them today and how the
[46:04] unbeliever is then is how they are today
[46:08] so it's just a it's just history has
[46:10] come around in a circle again and
[46:12] history's repeated
[46:14] itself so I just want to I just want to
[46:16] go to the conditions a little bit you
[46:17] know uh so Jesus that first scripture he
[46:20] read says as it was the days of Noah so
[46:22] shall it be in the days when the um so
[46:24] shall it be in the days of the son of
[46:25] man now let's go to Genesis chapter 6
[46:28] this is going to be a bit of a Bible
[46:29] study today uh but I want you to just
[46:32] see this is uh this is vital because if
[46:35] we can if we can just you know we've
[46:37] heard I'm sure some of us have heard for
[46:39] years we're in living in the days of lot
[46:41] we're living the days of Noah we see the
[46:43] conditions but we have to go just beyond
[46:45] of well these conditions we got to see
[46:47] how the people lad because if if the
[46:50] believer was led a certain way then
[46:52] they'll be led the same way today amen
[46:55] and the and the the make believer act
[46:56] the same way the unbeliever the same way
[46:58] so it's very important and and so we
[47:02] need to go into these things so let's
[47:03] just read here so Genesis 6 and we read
[47:06] verses 1 to8 and it said and it came to
[47:09] pass when men began to multiply on the
[47:11] face the earth and the and daughters
[47:14] were born unto them that the sons of God
[47:16] saw the daughters of men that they were
[47:18] fear and they took them wives of all
[47:20] which they chose and the Lord said my
[47:23] spirit shall not always strive with man
[47:26] for that he also is flesh yet his days
[47:28] shall be 120 years there were giants in
[47:31] the earth in those days and also after
[47:33] that when the sons of God came in unto
[47:35] the daughters of men they bear children
[47:37] unto them the same became Mighty Men
[47:40] which were of old men of reown and God
[47:43] saw that the wickedness of man was great
[47:46] in the earth and that every imagination
[47:48] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[47:50] evil continually and it repented the
[47:52] Lord that he made man on the earth and
[47:54] it grieved him at his heart heart and
[47:56] the Lord said I will destroy man whom I
[47:58] have created from the face of the Earth
[48:01] both man and Beast and creeping thing in
[48:03] the fouls of the year for it repented me
[48:05] that I made them but Noah found Grace in
[48:09] the eyes of the Lord so here's a picture
[48:11] now now but I want to I want to uh just
[48:15] just just look into this a little bit
[48:16] because you know many times we read the
[48:19] scripture we think the days of Noah and
[48:20] we think well there's great violence
[48:21] upon the Earth you know and there
[48:26] you know so so it's wickedness people
[48:28] were evil you know and we and we can see
[48:32] that is true man's imaginations
[48:34] continually evil as it was in the days
[48:36] of Noah we can see that you know it's
[48:39] actually how how the you know you know
[48:42] they married
[48:44] wives you know and then you know you
[48:47] they took them wives all of which they
[48:48] chose so so you know there's a lot of
[48:50] intermar you know marriage and
[48:51] remarriage all these things going on and
[48:54] then man has multiplied it says the
[48:55] first verse when men begin to multiply
[48:57] upon the face of the Earth and you can
[48:59] see you look at world population the
[49:00] world is greatly increased in population
[49:03] you know we can see that man's
[49:05] imagination is evil continually today
[49:08] but the question is what caused it to
[49:10] end up in this condition because you got
[49:12] to look at now what is the cause because
[49:14] if you can go to the cause then if you
[49:16] remedy that you know if you reverse what
[49:18] the cause is then you can undo the
[49:20] effects amen so now the very simple
[49:24] reason that
[49:26] God actually came to a stage where it
[49:28] actually repented him that he made man
[49:29] it grieved him he was you know he's
[49:31] actually sad that he even made man is
[49:34] actually it was the sons of God and what
[49:36] they did caused the world to come into
[49:38] this condition it was the sons of God
[49:40] doing it it wasn't now we understand in
[49:43] in in verse one and and verse two it
[49:45] says that the son you you're the
[49:47] daughters of men and the sons of God
[49:49] those are not Angels pressing themselves
[49:51] into human flesh we understand that the
[49:53] sons of God is from Seth's line and the
[49:55] Daughters of men are from Cain's line
[49:58] and there became an inter you
[49:59] interbreeding going on between God's you
[50:02] Seth's line and and can's line and so
[50:05] it's when it's when these two came
[50:08] together by by them coming together they
[50:12] caused the
[50:13] flood they caused it was the sons of God
[50:16] falling from their position because no
[50:19] doubt Adam would have said stay away
[50:21] from them they are not they are from the
[50:24] serpent a amen they knew it was a blood
[50:27] sin in in the garden amen so they would
[50:31] have said stay away from those they are
[50:33] not they may look human they may be the
[50:36] same they have a soul you know but
[50:38] they're not part of us okay so what but
[50:42] then what happened is there came a time
[50:43] now when the sons of God married into
[50:45] the daughters of men and it caused this
[50:48] fall amen they fell from their position
[50:52] and by falling from their position they
[50:54] actually caused the flood so it wasn't
[50:56] the daughter it wasn't necessarily what
[50:58] Cain's lineage was doing it was the sons
[51:00] of God what they were doing caused
[51:03] caused the flood to come so them falling
[51:06] from their
[51:07] position caused them and then you can
[51:09] see this if we go into second you know
[51:12] you you take Ahab marrying Jezebel
[51:14] because things just cycle around history
[51:16] repeats in Cycles you see Ahab he was an
[51:19] Israelite he was the king there but he
[51:22] married an unbeliever Gentile and she
[51:25] didn't become a Believer like Ruth did
[51:27] when she married Boaz or or Rahab
[51:29] married Salon um yeah yeah Salon or you
[51:32] know they they became Believers but
[51:35] Jezebel brought her religion into bail
[51:37] worship into into Israel and it became
[51:41] sanctioned by the state and they killed
[51:43] all the prophets and then the you know
[51:45] of God and they and they just worshiped
[51:47] ba so what happened is Ahab by marrying
[51:51] Jezebel caused the whole nation to
[51:53] fall amen
[51:57] and then you can see the same thing
[51:59] where the king of Judah which is um uh
[52:02] Jam uh Jarome if if that's how you
[52:04] pronounce it he married so so Ahab was
[52:07] the king of Israel you know you know at
[52:09] that time there were two kingdoms there
[52:10] was Judah and Israel there was a split
[52:12] and so Ahab married Jezebel and that
[52:14] brought in B worship he married the
[52:17] wrong way he didn't marry a Believer and
[52:19] then so that caused she and she didn't
[52:21] become converted she just brought her
[52:23] gods in and and they polluted Israel
[52:25] completely and then now what happened
[52:27] was the king of Judah now uh jihar or
[52:32] however you pronounce it um um I'm sorry
[52:36] he married ahab's daughter and then
[52:39] through her Bale worship came into
[52:42] Judah so by marrying the wrong they fell
[52:46] just like in Genesis 6 the sons of God
[52:48] saw the daughters of men they married
[52:49] them and they fell from their
[52:51] position amen so that actually that
[52:55] actually caused that actually caused the
[52:59] flood because you got to look at oh
[53:01] there's violence there's there's there's
[53:02] multiplication of people there's
[53:04] imaginations evil continually well well
[53:06] that's that's the symptoms but what's
[53:07] the cause how did this
[53:09] begin and that's how it
[53:12] be and then we can see even the same
[53:15] thing let's go to Matthew 24 are you all
[53:18] I trust this is not so out of left field
[53:20] I I trust you can see it in the Bible
[53:22] amen they fell from their position and
[53:24] by them falling it caused the
[53:27] flood so I'm just looking into some some
[53:30] conditions
[53:31] now CU you got to look at what Noah was
[53:35] facing am mean you got to see the
[53:37] conditions that you know you know that
[53:38] he had to he he had to wrestle with and
[53:41] then so Matthew 24 and we'll go to verse
[53:45] 27 so now remember so Matthew 24 the
[53:50] disciples asked three questions when
[53:52] shall these things be the destruction of
[53:54] the Temple when are you going to come
[53:56] and when's the end of the world and then
[53:57] he answers those three questions in that
[53:59] chapter Matthew 24:25 those two chapters
[54:02] and so now let's read from verse 27 down
[54:06] to verse
[54:07] 31 and then we're going to break this
[54:10] down for as the lightning cometh out of
[54:13] the East and shineth even unto the West
[54:15] so shall also the coming of the son of
[54:17] man be so as it was in the beginning
[54:19] it'll be the same same thing same same
[54:21] Ministry on display for whever the
[54:24] carcasses
[54:25] there will the Eagles be gathered
[54:27] together and then he um it's important
[54:30] when you read prophecy like this in the
[54:33] Book of Revelation and things it's not a
[54:35] linear thing it's like a step letter it
[54:37] goes up and down okay because be because
[54:43] we have had the son of man he has come
[54:46] he has revealed
[54:47] himself and then the Eagles have
[54:49] gathered to the word which is the
[54:50] carcass which is the word and he says
[54:53] immediately so so now he's going to put
[54:54] the in time immediately after the
[54:57] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[55:00] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[55:02] her light and the Stars shall fall from
[55:04] Heaven and the powers of the heavens
[55:08] shall be shaken that sounds a bit vague
[55:10] but this is what it means so he says
[55:12] remember he's talking he's talking to
[55:14] Jews here the apostles were Jews so he's
[55:17] saying immediately after the tribulation
[55:19] of those days and that tribulation is
[55:22] not the Great Tribulation that
[55:23] tribulation is what the suffered there
[55:25] in the Holocaust and and and those times
[55:29] where they were you know you know
[55:30] murdered and massacred and all these
[55:31] things that was a Great Tribulation they
[55:33] went through so that was the tribulation
[55:35] those and then after that the sun shall
[55:38] be
[55:39] darkened now this is all s you know
[55:41] symbolic it's not literally the Sun is
[55:43] going to be a permanent eclipse and all
[55:45] these things but the sun in the
[55:47] scripture represents Jesus yeah yeah it
[55:49] represents the light of the word amen so
[55:53] the Sun so the sun shall be darken so
[55:55] the light of the Gospel will not be able
[55:57] to shine as it has been and then if we
[56:01] go to Revelations chapter 9 and we don't
[56:03] have I don't want to give you too much
[56:06] detail I mean yeah I don't want to give
[56:07] you too much I want to get this thought
[56:09] out clear but you go to Revelations
[56:12] chapter 9 and there's a Angel Falls
[56:14] which is Lucifer himself he's given the
[56:16] key to open the bottomless pit which is
[56:18] hell and smoke comes out of the pit and
[56:21] smoke darkens you know when you try and
[56:24] look through through smoke you can't see
[56:26] things amen you can kind of see it have
[56:28] you ever had a big bonfire and there's a
[56:31] sun there or seen tried to look at the
[56:32] sun through smoke you can see the
[56:34] outline of it but you can't really see
[56:36] it as it as it would be if there was
[56:38] nothing in the way and smoke also gets
[56:40] in everything it blinds people you know
[56:42] you know have you ever had a barbecue
[56:44] whatever or you know a campfire and the
[56:45] smoke just comes into your eyes you
[56:46] can't even see and you know and so this
[56:49] is actually the effects of Hell coming
[56:51] upon the Earth has actually tried to
[56:53] darken out the gospel light
[56:56] shining amen because you think about it
[57:00] if this message came like at ausa Street
[57:03] or even before that before these things
[57:06] happened you think imagine the power it
[57:08] would have upon the whole
[57:10] world Amen why doesn't have the power
[57:13] why it's calling out the elect but it's
[57:14] because there's a blindness going on
[57:16] because something has been released and
[57:18] God's allowed it to happen said Darkness
[57:21] has come up smoke has come up out of the
[57:22] pit and this is what causes the sun to
[57:24] be
[57:26] darken amen and the moon shall not give
[57:30] her light now we understand that the
[57:32] Moon is a representation of the church
[57:34] and the moon doesn't have its own light
[57:36] it just reflects the light of the Sun
[57:38] and we don't have our own light we just
[57:40] reflect him amen so the Moon the Moon
[57:44] shall not give her light so there'll
[57:46] come a time when the church world is
[57:47] totally blacked
[57:49] out and I'll read you
[57:53] something this is in this is in shalom
[57:56] in
[57:58] 1964 and we're taught in the New
[58:00] Testament he says don't fail to get this
[58:03] in the New Testament that we're not of
[58:04] this city Jerusalem on Earth but we are
[58:06] from the New Jerusalem Above So this
[58:09] must be the moon Jerusalem not the New
[58:11] Jerusalem above so the moon representing
[58:13] the church Earthly and isn't it strange
[58:17] that just before the pope took his
[58:18] journey to Jerusalem that the moon and
[58:21] the heavens made a total blackout just a
[58:24] few days before he took it his journey
[58:26] he's coming there also I mean coming
[58:28] here also you know see now it's never
[58:31] been known see like for that to happen
[58:34] but what does it show that this he's
[58:37] he's doing this to win Fellowship as he
[58:40] met on the day after he came into
[58:42] Jerusalem he met the Greek Orthodox
[58:44] hierarchy and what does that reflect
[58:47] Fellowship they wanting Protestants and
[58:50] c and Catholicism joining together which
[58:53] they are doing and will will completely
[58:55] do and we've seen that lived out and God
[58:58] reflected this to us in the moon of a
[59:00] total blackout by his mercy and Grace
[59:03] did any of you see the paper where they
[59:05] took the pictures of the Moon I have it
[59:07] here if it ain't a perfect image leaving
[59:10] out the seventh age which is not yet
[59:12] exactly the way ijw it by the Holy
[59:14] Spirit the church ages there's six of
[59:16] them now these pictures are in the
[59:17] church age book if you want to see
[59:20] them um the six so the six conditions of
[59:23] the Moon how its brightness in the first
[59:25] church age dark in the second third
[59:28] fourth fifth and sixth just the way the
[59:30] Holy Spirit led me to draw them on the
[59:32] board and then identified them with
[59:34] himself on the wall of the Tabernacle
[59:35] two years ago the moon reflects it's uh
[59:39] sorry the moon reflects itself and
[59:41] science again picks up the picture of
[59:43] the church ages just as they picked up
[59:45] the light Yonder and put it in Life
[59:47] Magazine of the opening of the seals of
[59:49] the revealing in the age of the um uh uh
[59:52] um of the seventh angel and the days of
[59:54] his Ministry the seventh messenger the
[59:56] mysteries of God which all the Mysteries
[59:59] has been along the ages should be
[1:00:01] revealed made manifest it should be at
[1:00:03] that time and he did it his words don't
[1:00:06] fail isn't it that a mysterious thing
[1:00:08] God drawing in the heavens the same
[1:00:11] thing that they hold same God let me
[1:00:14] draw on the Blackboard and then by
[1:00:16] himself there's three times he's
[1:00:18] perfectly identified it and just before
[1:00:20] the pope goes into Jerusalem which that
[1:00:24] was the church Church the Moon is the
[1:00:25] church represents the church and before
[1:00:28] the church the shadow of the world
[1:00:30] crosses the moon and the shadow of
[1:00:32] worldl ism the shadow of worldliness
[1:00:35] worldly church has swept across to black
[1:00:37] out the entire light of the Bible the
[1:00:40] world got in the light of the reflection
[1:00:42] do you uh do you understand the world
[1:00:45] crossed in the light of the Moon and
[1:00:46] blinded out the sun and the reflection
[1:00:49] of the Moon that's supposed to be giving
[1:00:51] light to the Earth it was blacked out
[1:00:53] and it come and and draw the pictures
[1:00:55] just exactly like he did by inspiration
[1:00:57] before it happened so he's explaining
[1:00:59] when he when he's at the end of the
[1:01:01] series of the church ages he's I think
[1:01:02] he's in the revelations there and God
[1:01:04] came down and the PFI drew the circles
[1:01:07] of the church changes on the wall of the
[1:01:08] Tabernacle there's one sermon and right
[1:01:10] the end you hear a woman scream and it's
[1:01:12] right then when when God because the
[1:01:14] whole place saw it you hear a woman
[1:01:16] scream because she sees it and and God
[1:01:19] draws that and then later there's
[1:01:21] there's before the pope first time the
[1:01:23] pope ever goes to Jerusalem
[1:01:25] there's there's a there's a lunar
[1:01:27] eclipse before he goes to Jerusalem and
[1:01:29] this is why he's talking about the
[1:01:31] photographs so he so and things happen
[1:01:34] in heaven before it happens upon the
[1:01:36] Earth amen so he's saying that the sun
[1:01:39] shall not give her light I mean to the
[1:01:40] moon shall not give her light and it's
[1:01:43] already been shown the moon doesn't give
[1:01:45] her light anymore
[1:01:48] amen I'm just and the Stars shall fall
[1:01:52] from Heaven and the power
[1:01:54] of the heavens shall be
[1:01:57] shaken now the
[1:01:59] Stars the Stars Abraham he saw the sand
[1:02:03] of the sea and he saw the Stars he said
[1:02:06] this is how your seed is going to be the
[1:02:08] the sand of the seashore was the Jews
[1:02:11] and the stars in heaven were the
[1:02:12] Gentiles amen yeah you know the story
[1:02:16] God tells Abraham you're going to be the
[1:02:17] father of many nations can you number
[1:02:19] the sand of the sea can you Number the
[1:02:21] Stars I can't number that's how many you
[1:02:23] know you know
[1:02:25] you know you you know they'll be without
[1:02:27] number yeah so the stars represent
[1:02:30] Gentiles amen and the Stars falling
[1:02:33] because the literal stars are not going
[1:02:34] to fall to the Earth remember stars in
[1:02:37] heaven they're not these little bitty
[1:02:39] things they're massive they're not
[1:02:41] literally going to fall because if they
[1:02:43] fell if one fell to the Earth we
[1:02:44] wouldn't even be here so it's not
[1:02:46] speaking of a literal Stars falling it's
[1:02:49] Sy it's you know it's all symbolic and
[1:02:51] so the Stars shall fall from Heaven and
[1:02:53] the powers of the heavens shall be
[1:02:55] shaken so the stars now so these are
[1:02:57] meant to be Believers reflecting a light
[1:02:59] but they fall from their position what
[1:03:01] sons of God falling the you know from
[1:03:03] their position again and because the
[1:03:05] heavens we are seated in Heavenly places
[1:03:07] in Christ Jesus so the heaven has been
[1:03:10] here is a position see he's saying
[1:03:12] there's going to be Darkness the sun is
[1:03:14] not going to show her light the Moon is
[1:03:17] you know you the moon is going to be
[1:03:19] darkened and the Stars shall fall from
[1:03:20] Heaven and the of the heavens shall be
[1:03:22] shaken the church will be shaken
[1:03:25] and this has already
[1:03:27] happened amen
[1:03:29] so so he's saying this is what's going
[1:03:32] to happen and we say why is the world so
[1:03:35] bad is because the church has fallen
[1:03:37] from its position I'm just showing what
[1:03:40] happened there in the natural there in
[1:03:42] in in the days of Noah has repeated in
[1:03:44] the spiritual
[1:03:45] today this is why the
[1:03:48] world you know that's the reason the
[1:03:50] world's in its condition is because the
[1:03:52] church has fallen from its position am
[1:03:54] mean who's who's really the you know the
[1:03:57] voice against the wrong who should
[1:03:59] really stand up and say no that you know
[1:04:01] that is a moral that yo that that that
[1:04:03] we allow that to happen who used to
[1:04:06] censor things who doesn't censor things
[1:04:09] anymore who gobbles it up the church
[1:04:11] does christians do
[1:04:13] soal and he says this brother BR
[1:04:16] speaking the influence of another so
[1:04:17] it's not the you know the reason the
[1:04:19] world because there is never a vacuum in
[1:04:23] this life right there is never a void
[1:04:26] something will always fill the vacuum or
[1:04:27] fill the void and if so so if the if the
[1:04:32] church falls from its position
[1:04:33] something's going to fill that void
[1:04:35] who's filled the void the devil's filled
[1:04:37] the void who who dictates the society
[1:04:40] this is the way it should be the devil
[1:04:42] does Amen because this scripture has
[1:04:45] been
[1:04:46] fulfilled amen you must that it's very
[1:04:49] important and then so he says in in in
[1:04:52] in the influence of another
[1:04:55] he says
[1:04:58] this
[1:04:59] um he says they don't know sorry I'll
[1:05:03] just read this from the beginning don't
[1:05:05] try to make yourself big like Uzziah so
[1:05:07] remember Uzziah he was the king he was
[1:05:09] blessed and he tried to take the priest
[1:05:11] place but he was a king he had no right
[1:05:13] to be a priest and so he tried to offer
[1:05:15] incense before the Lord he was struck
[1:05:16] with
[1:05:17] Leprosy so don't try and make yourself
[1:05:20] big like uzai basically I can do what I
[1:05:22] want he got in the he said I'll do this
[1:05:25] anyhow whether you ain't got no business
[1:05:28] telling me see the priest actually said
[1:05:29] you shouldn't do this but he just he
[1:05:30] just went it anyway he would have made
[1:05:33] himself humble yes Servants of God
[1:05:35] pardon me he'd never took leprosy if he
[1:05:38] just humbled himself no um I know that's
[1:05:42] your job God called you that's your
[1:05:43] office you go ahead and do it sir I'm
[1:05:46] very sorry backed off then uh uh there'd
[1:05:50] be a different writing in this book see
[1:05:52] see if he actually did that
[1:05:54] but when he was corrected he got angry
[1:05:56] you can correct people about something
[1:05:58] or tell them tell them about their
[1:06:01] wrongdoing they'll leave the church they
[1:06:04] won't got um they won't have none go to
[1:06:07] somebody tell tell woman they shouldn't
[1:06:09] wear short here well I'll go somewhere
[1:06:11] where they can wear it and a lady went
[1:06:13] here not long ago I sent my wife down
[1:06:15] there was in a meeting she didn't have
[1:06:17] time to wash her ha and I told her to go
[1:06:19] to one of them beauty shops and get her
[1:06:20] hair washed she went over there and that
[1:06:22] lady didn't even know how to put her
[1:06:24] hair up she had to twist it up around
[1:06:26] the top of her head come on said I never
[1:06:28] did wash anybody's hair with long hair
[1:06:30] she didn't know anything about it I
[1:06:32] don't know oh my see they don't know
[1:06:35] what it's all about why why so so notice
[1:06:39] the reason he goes why is the world in
[1:06:40] this it's because of weak pulpits they'
[1:06:44] have been sitting under that's right
[1:06:46] it's exactly right the weak pulpits that
[1:06:49] won't tell the truth they compromise
[1:06:51] with it so it wasn't so so so he didn't
[1:06:54] go to oh it's Hollywood and it's
[1:06:55] influence and this is why they do that
[1:06:57] now he says it's weak
[1:06:58] pulpits amen it's weak pulpits they
[1:07:01] compromise with the truth and that's why
[1:07:03] the world see the powers of heaven will
[1:07:05] be shaken amen the moon won't reflect
[1:07:08] the light anymore why because the church
[1:07:10] has
[1:07:13] fallen
[1:07:16] now I would have been better uh it would
[1:07:19] have been better if you hear it and you
[1:07:22] was to talk to one of them they'll get
[1:07:24] up and blow up and say I'll never hear
[1:07:26] that Holy Roller again see go ahead
[1:07:28] youai that's right leprosy well I'd
[1:07:31] rather have leprosy anytime than that
[1:07:33] kind of leprosy well that's leprosy of
[1:07:35] the Soul see so sin in your soul see
[1:07:38] when you go up and broke out you're
[1:07:41] right when you broke out again leprosy
[1:07:43] sin which is worse than leprosy it's
[1:07:45] leprosy of the Soul Uzziah probably went
[1:07:48] and slept with his fathers in the Bible
[1:07:49] said which he was saved because he just
[1:07:53] did something wrong but when you do it
[1:07:55] knowing better then you break out a
[1:07:56] leprosy of the soul and then there's no
[1:07:59] way to take a uh Lep's soul in you know
[1:08:02] that go then make yourself little humble
[1:08:05] yourself because uh uh humble yourself
[1:08:07] before God recognize don't get all
[1:08:09] puffed up and blow up search the
[1:08:11] scriptures and see if it's right see
[1:08:14] he's saying the reason the world's in
[1:08:15] this condition is because of weak
[1:08:17] pulpits amen what is that that is the
[1:08:20] sons of God falling from their position
[1:08:23] as it was the days of no so shall it be
[1:08:25] when the son of man is
[1:08:27] revealed
[1:08:29] amen so that's why and we see that
[1:08:31] Christianity has fallen from where it
[1:08:33] once was and and and once again it's
[1:08:36] because of a uniting of with Pagan
[1:08:38] Darkness just like Ahab and Jezebel and
[1:08:41] drum did marrying so just as Ahab
[1:08:43] married Jezebel and drum married their
[1:08:45] daughter as a uniting of real you say
[1:08:48] Christianity and Pagan darkness and
[1:08:49] that's what caused the fall and that's
[1:08:51] what happened there in the natural there
[1:08:54] in the days of Noah
[1:08:57] amen now we have to unfortunate well not
[1:09:02] unfortunately we have to admit that
[1:09:03] there's always three classes of
[1:09:05] people yeah there's Believers make
[1:09:09] Believers and unbelievers there's always
[1:09:13] three and now so we see so if we see how
[1:09:18] so Noah Noah was divinely led we can all
[1:09:22] agree it's said he found Noah found the
[1:09:25] grace in the sight of the Lord he
[1:09:26] received a vision now you going to build
[1:09:28] the ark I'm going to destroy the Earth
[1:09:29] but I'm going to give a way of escape to
[1:09:31] whosoever will let them come so the True
[1:09:34] Believer is led directly by God from his
[1:09:37] word amen the True Believer is led
[1:09:40] directly by God they know the author of
[1:09:42] the book and the author leads them in
[1:09:44] his word amen this may be very
[1:09:47] Elementary but but there's a great
[1:09:48] dividing line between a real believer
[1:09:50] and a make believer but remember a real
[1:09:52] believer at once stage can be an
[1:09:54] unbeliever then they can be a make
[1:09:56] believer because they want to believe
[1:09:58] but then eventually God will make them a
[1:09:59] Believer but an unbeliever can never be
[1:10:01] a believer and a make believer can never
[1:10:03] become a real believer amen and you must
[1:10:07] understand if the word calls you a lot
[1:10:08] or calls you a you know some some some
[1:10:11] make believer remember lot could not
[1:10:13] have a second birth amen you know you
[1:10:17] know the make Believers that hung around
[1:10:18] the ark they could only be make
[1:10:20] Believers but we have we have the
[1:10:22] opportunity to receive another birth to
[1:10:24] make us a Believer amen so we can be
[1:10:27] born again so we made a Sarah and
[1:10:29] Abraham amen but lot never had that
[1:10:31] opportunity Cain could never be birthed
[1:10:34] amen again to become a real believer he
[1:10:37] didn't have that opportunity that side
[1:10:38] of
[1:10:39] Calvary but but we have that
[1:10:43] opportunity so there's always three
[1:10:44] classes of people but as I said the um
[1:10:48] the believer can at one time be a make
[1:10:50] believer or an unbeliever I was an
[1:10:52] unbeliever one time but in me was to be
[1:10:55] a real believer and then God came across
[1:10:57] my path and just revealed himself to me
[1:11:00] and showed hey you're actually a
[1:11:01] Believer I mean you're not a make
[1:11:03] believer an unbeliever though you were
[1:11:05] in those conditions you actually became
[1:11:07] a real believer and so now we can see
[1:11:10] lot as it was the days of lot now lot
[1:11:14] was a make
[1:11:15] believer amen lot was not Abraham and
[1:11:19] Abraham was not
[1:11:20] lot and it's the same thing in Noah's
[1:11:23] day we say who were the make Believers
[1:11:24] in Noah's day there would have been
[1:11:26] people hanging around the
[1:11:27] ark amen you see it today when
[1:11:30] California goes in then I'll know the
[1:11:32] message is
[1:11:33] true amen they're just hanging around
[1:11:36] they you know they got the air out they
[1:11:38] know something's going to take place
[1:11:40] when California sinks in then I'll RAR
[1:11:42] come to the Lord I'll give my life
[1:11:44] that's being a make believer because I
[1:11:46] believe when that happens it'll be too
[1:11:48] late amen we'll really know as a prophet
[1:11:51] when California thinks yeah you will but
[1:11:52] you'll be outside
[1:11:54] you don't want to be outside what's that
[1:11:56] people hanging around the ark people
[1:11:58] hanging around the place of safety
[1:12:00] knowing there's a place of safety they
[1:12:02] just hang around how you doing Noah
[1:12:04] how's how's the boat going today well I
[1:12:07] just put in the cross beams and now I
[1:12:08] put this floor and oh can I help you
[1:12:10] with that a little bit amen what can I
[1:12:13] do in church I'm just going to hone a
[1:12:15] drill down if this is quiet it's fine
[1:12:18] amen what can I do and then so you know
[1:12:20] they come and they hang around and they
[1:12:22] even try and partake of things but they
[1:12:25] don't when it comes to the crunch
[1:12:27] they're not willing to step
[1:12:28] inside amen they're not willing to
[1:12:30] actually step into the door the door's
[1:12:32] there hey it was a big door amen no
[1:12:35] would have had a big door into the ark
[1:12:36] two by two they went in it would have
[1:12:39] been a big door even if they just took
[1:12:40] the baby elephants and you know you know
[1:12:42] a baby elephant's still a big animal a
[1:12:45] baby hippo is still a big thing you you
[1:12:47] know wouldn't have been one of these
[1:12:48] doors would have been a big door amen
[1:12:51] just walk in there and and and and stay
[1:12:52] in there
[1:12:54] oh yeah we will and they would have
[1:12:55] thought you know oh now the door's shut
[1:12:57] God shut the door no or open it when it
[1:13:00] rains but God shut the
[1:13:02] door amen but Noah those people weren't
[1:13:07] led by God to to build the ark they did
[1:13:11] not have a commission by God to do this
[1:13:14] but then you see Noah's family had to
[1:13:16] come under that same vision and so all
[1:13:19] Noah had to do is just lay the blueprint
[1:13:21] lay the blueprint in front of his family
[1:13:24] amen you got to lay the blueprint you
[1:13:26] know you know no what I said God's told
[1:13:28] me to build this
[1:13:30] boat because they would have come a day
[1:13:32] but it found great you Noah found Grace
[1:13:34] in the sight of God there would have
[1:13:36] come a day where where his sons would
[1:13:38] have come to him what's happened to you
[1:13:42] you know he would have been he would
[1:13:43] have been stirred up we're going to
[1:13:44] build this boat we going to cut some
[1:13:45] wood I got to you know I got to build
[1:13:46] this big he would have been stirred up
[1:13:49] something happened to Noah dad what
[1:13:51] happened to you what are you doing
[1:13:53] building boats we we don't even live
[1:13:55] near water it's going to rain it's never
[1:13:57] what do you mean it's going to rain God
[1:13:59] told me it's going to rain and maybe
[1:14:01] they would have laughed at them to begin
[1:14:03] with amen hey they were people like
[1:14:06] we're people amen their family like we
[1:14:10] have
[1:14:11] family amen but I believe they would
[1:14:13] have seen a difference in Noah and so
[1:14:16] Noah just kept laying the blueprint out
[1:14:17] God's to do this look at the world and
[1:14:20] how bad it is we know our God is a
[1:14:22] righteous God and he's a judge and if
[1:14:24] he's a judge there has to be a penalty
[1:14:26] for crossing his word and look at how
[1:14:28] these people are but they're good people
[1:14:30] Dad no let's just build the ark and
[1:14:32] let's give them an opportunity and show
[1:14:35] them they just need to get in the door
[1:14:36] when it's finished am me but let's focus
[1:14:39] building the ark and then eventually
[1:14:41] because it took Faith to step into that
[1:14:43] door it took genuine Faith to step into
[1:14:45] the Ark in that day so his so his sons
[1:14:49] and their wives had to believe like he
[1:14:51] believed they had to have the the same
[1:14:53] faith that he had but remember he had
[1:14:55] the vision to build it but then they
[1:14:57] came under that same anointing to build
[1:14:59] the ark because they believed if they
[1:15:02] didn't believe they would never have
[1:15:03] gone to the ark this why you just got to
[1:15:05] lay the blueprint in front of your
[1:15:07] family why are we why are we doing these
[1:15:09] things dad why are we doing these things
[1:15:11] Mom it's because we're this is an arc of
[1:15:15] safety amen and love is drawing us into
[1:15:18] that Ark of Safety amen and we do these
[1:15:21] things because we love the Lord
[1:15:25] amen if that's all you can drill into
[1:15:27] your kids drill it
[1:15:28] in amen it's important we love him this
[1:15:31] is why we do this not because of fear I
[1:15:34] don't live this way because I'm scared
[1:15:35] I'm going to go to hell I don't I'm not
[1:15:38] scared I'm going to you know I don't
[1:15:39] live this way because I'm scared I'm
[1:15:40] going to go into the
[1:15:41] tribulation amen because if fear is
[1:15:43] driving you it won't get you in but if
[1:15:45] love drives you you pulled in I feel a
[1:15:48] pull Lord I Surrender my life amen you
[1:15:50] getting pulled into the ark h there's
[1:15:53] got to be that love there then that love
[1:15:56] has to be projected to your
[1:15:59] family so they had to they had to become
[1:16:01] Believers like Noah did but the make
[1:16:04] Believers just hung around the ark amen
[1:16:08] and there would have been and and and
[1:16:10] and and there came a separation time
[1:16:13] because the make Believers would have no
[1:16:15] doubt acted like Noah's
[1:16:16] family at a stage amen they would have
[1:16:20] said yes you know you know you're a
[1:16:22] prophet of the Lord I believe your word
[1:16:24] Noah but they only confessed it with
[1:16:27] their mouth they didn't put their hand
[1:16:28] to it and actually gone to the ark
[1:16:33] amen so that was that was the make
[1:16:37] Believers that he had to contend
[1:16:40] with and then so Abraham had the same
[1:16:43] thing with
[1:16:44] lot amen is this
[1:16:49] okay so first we have to admit there's
[1:16:51] three classes of people and I and and
[1:16:54] this is from God as his own interpret in
[1:16:56] 64 it meant just exactly what he said as
[1:16:59] it was in the days of lot so shall it be
[1:17:01] at the coming of the son of man what
[1:17:04] about the days of lot let's go back just
[1:17:06] for a moment and find out what they were
[1:17:08] doing there were three class of people
[1:17:11] in the days of lot believer make
[1:17:13] believer unbeliever remember a make
[1:17:15] believer can
[1:17:17] actually you know brother bam he you
[1:17:19] know gives an illustration that a mule
[1:17:21] which is a hybrid between a donkey and a
[1:17:23] horse can outwork a real horse a real
[1:17:27] thoroughbread horse a mule could outwork
[1:17:30] a real thoroughbread horse amen so but
[1:17:34] that is actually just a Hy he says he
[1:17:36] said modern day Christianity is a mule
[1:17:38] it's a hybrid religion so it going to
[1:17:41] appear to do more than a
[1:17:43] real amen so that's why you never
[1:17:47] actually look at someone because I just
[1:17:49] had a feeling oh you think now I'm
[1:17:50] getting all
[1:17:52] legalistic remember Lot's wife she undid
[1:17:54] one part of the wood she became a pillar
[1:17:56] of salt but remember the make believer
[1:17:59] many times will be more religious than
[1:18:01] the
[1:18:02] believer amen a mule can can can can out
[1:18:07] horse a
[1:18:08] horse amen so a make believer a message
[1:18:12] make believer can out message believer
[1:18:15] you know can can actually out be out
[1:18:18] Christian a real message
[1:18:20] believer
[1:18:21] amen am amen so don't don't NE look at
[1:18:26] what people do or what they say they do
[1:18:29] look at the LI go be no when I say look
[1:18:32] at the life you got to look at more than
[1:18:34] just well they do this and they do this
[1:18:35] and they always come to church and they
[1:18:36] always do this and they do this that's
[1:18:38] not what I talk about that's not what
[1:18:40] I'm meaning I mean look at their look at
[1:18:42] their life how they are with their
[1:18:45] family hey they have we all have
[1:18:46] struggles Abraham had
[1:18:48] struggles amen he didn't he didn't live
[1:18:50] on the best part of the land he lived up
[1:18:51] in the desert parts
[1:18:54] amen they they had struggles but they
[1:18:56] were
[1:18:57] Believers you
[1:19:00] understand and so don't look at how they
[1:19:03] look at how they live a Believer but I
[1:19:06] mean but don't say someone's a real
[1:19:08] believer because they can out you know
[1:19:10] they can make you look like you're not
[1:19:12] even
[1:19:13] in because some people are very good at
[1:19:16] that hold on hold on don't but then at
[1:19:20] the same time don't lean too far and say
[1:19:22] well I need to do anything but what is
[1:19:25] your what is your what is your you know
[1:19:28] what is your
[1:19:29] motive if your motive
[1:19:31] is I want to be the best Christian I can
[1:19:35] be in My Own
[1:19:37] Strength that is actually that is
[1:19:39] actually a wrong
[1:19:40] motive amen because Lucifer said I will
[1:19:44] be like the most high he said I will be
[1:19:46] like the most high that was his ambition
[1:19:49] so if someone has the ambition I will
[1:19:52] personify this message in
[1:19:54] flesh amen we all want to be like Jesus
[1:19:57] but there's a big difference between
[1:19:58] saying I shall be the bride of Christ
[1:20:01] then Lord You' have made me the bride of
[1:20:03] Christ because one is actually
[1:20:05] Antichrist I will be like the most high
[1:20:08] that was Satan's ambition I will
[1:20:10] personify this message I will be the
[1:20:12] word and
[1:20:13] flesh the problem with that statement is
[1:20:16] I I will it's not you will he will amen
[1:20:21] it's not your ability it's his
[1:20:23] ability amen because if we're you know
[1:20:26] if we're not careful we'll start to
[1:20:28] flatulate ourselves by looking at what
[1:20:30] we don't
[1:20:31] do amen but we forget God gives
[1:20:35] Grace amen he understands when you're
[1:20:37] busy he understands when you're stressed
[1:20:40] he understands when you're sick he
[1:20:42] understands when you're tired he doesn't
[1:20:45] beat you because you're tired that's not
[1:20:47] the that's not how God operates he
[1:20:50] understands that but then he also
[1:20:51] understands when you're
[1:20:54] lazy amen he just understands in a
[1:20:57] different way and he may and he also
[1:20:59] understands when you just make
[1:21:01] excuses amen I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:21:04] keep it down the middle of the road but
[1:21:05] if it's if it's
[1:21:07] love if your homeo of is love why do you
[1:21:11] pray do you pray because you want to
[1:21:13] feel some great anointing and be have
[1:21:15] some great big experience or do you pray
[1:21:18] because you love
[1:21:19] him amen do you read your B because you
[1:21:23] want to see you know Eve the reason Eve
[1:21:26] fell is because she received Satan's
[1:21:30] wisdom which is actually ahead of the
[1:21:32] plan of God
[1:21:35] Amen yeah she actually thirsted for
[1:21:38] knowledge and that why she fell you'll
[1:21:41] be like Gods you know between good and
[1:21:43] evil that was the that was the carrot
[1:21:46] but it wasn't the stick the stick was
[1:21:48] death amen so she actually thirsted
[1:21:51] after something before God was actually
[1:21:52] willing to reveal
[1:21:55] it
[1:21:56] amen so then now we can actually and if
[1:21:59] you read spoken words The Original Seed
[1:22:01] I believe it's in there brother Braham
[1:22:02] speaks about the same danger the church
[1:22:05] tries to obtain things before it's God
[1:22:08] season to reveal it and that's why
[1:22:10] there's been splits in the messages
[1:22:12] because because Doctrine has been
[1:22:14] partially revealed then what happens
[1:22:16] people grab it and they begin to preach
[1:22:18] it before it becomes fully
[1:22:20] mature and it causes division
[1:22:23] because if you look at we are the vine
[1:22:25] he is the vine we are the branches he's
[1:22:27] speaking of a grape vine if you pla
[1:22:30] grapes before they're fully ripe they're
[1:22:32] bitter they're sour are they not amen so
[1:22:36] now people have come and they've plucked
[1:22:40] Revelation before it's become fully
[1:22:41] mature and they've preached it and what
[1:22:43] does it cause bitterness sourness
[1:22:46] division amen why because what happens
[1:22:49] is man it's always man's ambition
[1:22:53] to take this and they want to see more
[1:22:56] than the next
[1:22:57] man amen it's always been man's
[1:23:00] ambition instead of waiting for God to
[1:23:03] reveal it they try and put it all
[1:23:04] together and it's oh but where the bride
[1:23:07] of Christ look down through history
[1:23:08] you've seen last 50 years it's been
[1:23:10] happening over and over
[1:23:12] again why because man has been thirsting
[1:23:14] for
[1:23:16] knowledge amen well shouldn't it say
[1:23:18] that we should understand the breadth
[1:23:21] and the height and the depth of the love
[1:23:22] of God Amen it says that no man has seen
[1:23:25] you know you hasn't even entered into
[1:23:27] the mind of man what God has revealed or
[1:23:29] has in stored for them that love him but
[1:23:31] the spirit SE searches out the Deep
[1:23:33] things of God
[1:23:35] absolutely so you should seek these
[1:23:37] things out but if you're seeking it see
[1:23:40] I don't know if youve I'm sure this is
[1:23:42] pretty obvious but man uses this as a
[1:23:45] weapon and he uses this to dominate
[1:23:48] other men or women amen so he comes
[1:23:52] along and says this is what I
[1:23:55] know and he just learns it and he
[1:23:57] actually uses that to dominate
[1:24:00] people and brother B he makes a quote
[1:24:02] and maybe I'm just jumping waye to
[1:24:05] myself but he makes a
[1:24:07] quote he says this isn't trying to to
[1:24:10] God a service without his um um without
[1:24:13] his
[1:24:14] will and he speaks about the conditions
[1:24:18] of the of the uh you know of the church
[1:24:23] and he says he says here he says and
[1:24:25] millions of people spend their money and
[1:24:27] put in great Crusades and churches all
[1:24:29] went together great auditoriums and
[1:24:31] great things and great things taking
[1:24:32] place why did it fail it's because they
[1:24:35] never know the hour they're living no
[1:24:37] wonder Jesus stood and in his heart he
[1:24:39] wept tears down his cheeks he said
[1:24:40] Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how often will I
[1:24:43] have hovered you you as a hen would have
[1:24:45] brooded you stoned every Prophet I sent
[1:24:47] to you but you would not but now your
[1:24:50] hour has come can't you Fe feel the Holy
[1:24:53] Spirit screaming out from you oh United
[1:24:55] States and the world how off I would
[1:24:57] have gathered you but you would not now
[1:24:59] your hour has come your God of Pleasure
[1:25:01] your god of Filth your Sodom and
[1:25:03] Gomorrah God that's come among you even
[1:25:05] our little kids Beetle haircuts and
[1:25:07] bangs down their faces little pervert
[1:25:09] starting out our women are gone beyond
[1:25:11] Redemption our men has become big
[1:25:13] sissies walking around with little
[1:25:15] shorts on and acting like a girl and
[1:25:17] hair hanging down their necks where're
[1:25:18] sodomites and the fire and the wrath of
[1:25:21] God waits for for
[1:25:23] us you'll know and so and so he's saying
[1:25:28] actually the whole world is in this
[1:25:29] condition and how does that come into a
[1:25:32] religious realm man controlling man amen
[1:25:37] man dominating man that's actually a
[1:25:39] sodomite condition in the religious
[1:25:41] realm I know I'm probably using strong
[1:25:42] words but you take man because you know
[1:25:46] a minister if he is preaching his own
[1:25:50] thoughts or you know if he is preaching
[1:25:54] either his personality or his own
[1:25:56] thoughts or his motives that is that is
[1:25:59] actually his own
[1:26:03] seed amen a minister is meant to be a
[1:26:06] unic as in it's not he's just a mailman
[1:26:09] that just gives you mail it's not him
[1:26:11] writing the mail it's God writing the
[1:26:12] mail amen it's not his his thoughts his
[1:26:15] motives his objectives because of it is
[1:26:18] that's actually man on man that's man
[1:26:20] controlling man amen man is this okay
[1:26:24] you got to think about it real deep
[1:26:26] because if someone if I come with my own
[1:26:28] thought we we become into that
[1:26:31] condition amen but if I come with with
[1:26:34] with with Not My Thoughts not what I'm
[1:26:37] thinking and God just comes and speaks
[1:26:39] that's a very different thing that
[1:26:41] that's when God is actually delivering
[1:26:43] the male so he's actually saying that we
[1:26:45] are and so the church world has become
[1:26:47] this way is because man has taken his
[1:26:49] own thoughts he's taken this as a weapon
[1:26:52] look at all the books I've written look
[1:26:53] at all the years I've studied and they
[1:26:56] actually use it to try you know and they
[1:26:58] control people with their own knowledge
[1:27:01] why because man thirst for
[1:27:04] knowledge instead of waiting for God to
[1:27:06] reveal it well does that mean we
[1:27:08] shouldn't read and and pray and listen
[1:27:10] to the message you should absolutely do
[1:27:12] those things God reveal
[1:27:14] it you got to let God reveal it amen do
[1:27:19] your Bible studies look into things
[1:27:20] absolutely but God put it together you
[1:27:24] understand so so I'm not preaching
[1:27:26] spiritual ignorance here dig in dig into
[1:27:28] the resource we have in this age I mean
[1:27:31] dig into the word dig down until you get
[1:27:33] something and then refine it up
[1:27:35] absolutely but don't just don't thirst
[1:27:38] for
[1:27:39] knowledge there's a you know there's a
[1:27:42] big difference between wanting to know
[1:27:44] and thirsting for
[1:27:45] knowledge amen because one has the right
[1:27:49] objective one has the wrong
[1:27:51] objective and the wrong objective
[1:27:53] normally is look at me I know more than
[1:27:56] you
[1:27:58] amen so
[1:28:01] now he
[1:28:04] says so
[1:28:08] lot lot hung
[1:28:11] around remember lot was not called like
[1:28:14] Abraham was called lot was not even part
[1:28:17] of the picture but lot decided to go
[1:28:19] with Abraham and the blessing that fell
[1:28:22] on Abraham fell on lot cuz there came a
[1:28:25] time where both their herds were too big
[1:28:28] and their Shepherds were fighting and
[1:28:29] then so they had to separate so it
[1:28:31] wasn't only Abraham being blessed it was
[1:28:33] Lot was being blessed amen so the make
[1:28:36] believer can be with right with the
[1:28:39] believer and they can receive the same
[1:28:41] blessing amen because they're hanging
[1:28:44] around the real
[1:28:46] believer but if but the real but but
[1:28:48] then what defines the two is the real
[1:28:51] believer has a in their heart this is
[1:28:52] the end goal I mean they actually know
[1:28:55] where they're going they know why
[1:28:56] they're traveling they know why they're
[1:28:59] walking this way so so so Abraham God
[1:29:02] called him said get out of your country
[1:29:03] go to another country I'll give you the
[1:29:05] land you're going to be the father of
[1:29:06] many nations so he had that Divine call
[1:29:09] and then so he
[1:29:10] went amen but lot just just tagged along
[1:29:14] he didn't have that Divine call and so
[1:29:17] it's the same thing today when God comes
[1:29:19] to you amen leave your country leave and
[1:29:23] I'm not talking about physical location
[1:29:25] leave your condition leave leave the
[1:29:27] world Amen leave the church you were
[1:29:30] once in leave that place and I'll show
[1:29:32] you your inheritance am mean I'll take
[1:29:34] you into a different land that you know
[1:29:36] nothing about I mean then God called you
[1:29:38] and you begin to realize there's more to
[1:29:40] this than I knew amen and you put down
[1:29:43] your Sunday school literature and the
[1:29:45] denominational ideas you pick up the
[1:29:47] inheritance amen and then God begins to
[1:29:50] transform you as he transforms Abraham
[1:29:53] Hallelujah and then so that's a big
[1:29:55] difference Abraham actually knew where
[1:29:57] he was going and why he was going and
[1:29:59] and and that's the same thing with the
[1:30:00] bride in this hour we know why we're
[1:30:02] walking the way we walk because we've
[1:30:05] received a Divine call even it's just
[1:30:07] God saying you're wrong how do you know
[1:30:10] God's calling you because you something
[1:30:12] and you just says I know I'm wrong and
[1:30:14] then you give yourself to him it's not
[1:30:17] necessar a big thunder and lightning
[1:30:18] time but there's something in you says I
[1:30:20] know and then you just surrender your
[1:30:22] life amen and then you start the journey
[1:30:25] Hallelujah so the bright and and that's
[1:30:27] why the Rapture is becoming a greater
[1:30:29] reality to us I mean the change in the
[1:30:31] body is becoming a greater reality is
[1:30:34] because just like Abraham's promise it
[1:30:36] started off with there's a land that I'm
[1:30:38] going to give you and then you and then
[1:30:40] you're going to be father of Nations and
[1:30:41] it honed it down where God said no you
[1:30:44] and Sarah are going to have the promised
[1:30:45] son and he says now look and then now
[1:30:47] these are the borders of the land you
[1:30:49] know you going to be the promise was
[1:30:51] refining itself self all the way down
[1:30:53] it's the same thing with us you know you
[1:30:56] know you walk into the prince of God God
[1:30:57] calls you and then you know you know
[1:30:59] you're a sinner and you surrender your
[1:31:01] life and then he picks up that life and
[1:31:03] then you begin to find out there's a
[1:31:05] Rapture and then you begin to find out
[1:31:07] there's a Rapture call and then you
[1:31:09] recognize I've heard the call and then
[1:31:11] you actually begin to recognize I am the
[1:31:12] Rapture cuz I'm going in it
[1:31:15] Hallelujah
[1:31:17] so you know there's always but then lot
[1:31:22] lot did not have that
[1:31:24] call and that's why it's vital that you
[1:31:27] know him amen you you got to know you
[1:31:31] got to know that you're called amen
[1:31:35] there's something in your a deep calling
[1:31:36] to the Deep you got to know that there's
[1:31:37] a deep
[1:31:39] there amen
[1:31:42] now so
[1:31:44] the so Then There came May so lot just
[1:31:48] went along and received the blessings
[1:31:50] that fell upon Abraham
[1:31:52] now I just got on my notes may we never
[1:31:54] fall into that
[1:31:56] bracket amen as I said lot could not be
[1:31:59] born again and become an Abraham but
[1:32:02] this s of Calvary the make believer can
[1:32:05] be birthed and be made a real
[1:32:07] believer amen and then we can see now we
[1:32:10] can see lot's condition because when
[1:32:12] they came that separation time Abraham
[1:32:15] told lot look up and choose where you
[1:32:18] want to go in the land and I'll just go
[1:32:20] the different way and so lot looked down
[1:32:23] and he beheld the plain of Jordan and
[1:32:24] all the well watered you you know that
[1:32:26] were all well watered um and this is
[1:32:29] before God destroyed s Gomorrah so he
[1:32:31] said I'm going to live there and then
[1:32:33] but he said then he pitched his tent
[1:32:34] towards Sodom so then he so he went to
[1:32:38] the well watered places but then he
[1:32:40] pitched his tent in such a way that it
[1:32:42] was facing Sodom and
[1:32:45] Gomorrah and even even when he did that
[1:32:48] it says but the men of Sodom were Wicked
[1:32:50] and sinners before before the Lord
[1:32:52] exceedingly so Sodom and Gomorrah were
[1:32:53] already in its condition when lot came
[1:32:56] and pitched his tent towards it yeah so
[1:33:00] unfortunately because Abraham was called
[1:33:02] lot didn't have what he needed in him to
[1:33:05] be dragged out of that condition because
[1:33:07] he started off being
[1:33:09] separated in the plains and then I don't
[1:33:12] know how much longer after this he's
[1:33:13] living in
[1:33:15] Sodom
[1:33:17] amen and so the make believer that's why
[1:33:20] that's why you got to have a real birth
[1:33:22] Because unless Abraham you know if
[1:33:25] Abraham did not have the calling he had
[1:33:28] and did not have the visitations of God
[1:33:29] that he had he would have ended up in
[1:33:31] Sodom
[1:33:32] too he would have because man is man
[1:33:35] amen whether whether we like it or not
[1:33:37] oh God has done all this for me unless
[1:33:39] you've been real
[1:33:41] change
[1:33:43] amen I'm so glad for the new birth now
[1:33:47] so but then it came to him and so maybe
[1:33:50] maybe he thought you know know remember
[1:33:53] he was a rich man he had a lot of cattle
[1:33:54] he had a lot of herds of things but then
[1:33:57] somehow he thought life in sodum would
[1:33:59] have been better than life and life out
[1:34:01] in the fields as a farmer so somehow in
[1:34:03] his mind he must have reasoned it out
[1:34:05] maybe I can get a better job down in
[1:34:06] Sodom maybe I can just help them and and
[1:34:09] get them to turn from their ways or you
[1:34:11] know you know he must have he must have
[1:34:13] reasoned it in some kind of you know
[1:34:15] maybe I could look after my family in a
[1:34:17] better way by going down and there but
[1:34:20] then it came then but then it came to a
[1:34:23] point where it says in second Peter 2:6
[1:34:26] and turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:34:27] Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with
[1:34:29] an overthrow making them an example unto
[1:34:33] those that should that that should um
[1:34:36] that after should live ungodly and
[1:34:38] delivered just lot vexed with the filthy
[1:34:41] conversation of the wicked for that
[1:34:44] righteous man dwelling among them and
[1:34:46] seeing and hearing vexed his righteous
[1:34:48] soul from day to day with their unlawful
[1:34:51] Deeds
[1:34:52] so he was actually vexed living in Sodom
[1:34:56] he was vexed but then the question is
[1:34:57] now who was he righteous compared to
[1:35:00] because he wasn't righteous compared to
[1:35:02] Abraham amen he was a righteous man
[1:35:04] compared to the sodomites but you see he
[1:35:07] was in that
[1:35:09] place but he didn't have what he needed
[1:35:11] to change them amen he didn't understand
[1:35:16] the day and hour which he was living in
[1:35:18] because if he understood the day and
[1:35:20] hour he would have remained with
[1:35:22] Abraham amen because there was a time
[1:35:25] where that city was going to be burned
[1:35:26] and God himself was going to Vis Abraham
[1:35:29] and Sarah and they going to have the
[1:35:30] promised son that was a promise for the
[1:35:32] age amen so if he really recognized the
[1:35:35] day he was living in he would never have
[1:35:37] ended up in Sodom and gomorra he would
[1:35:39] have stayed up with
[1:35:40] Abraham and so the place vexed him but
[1:35:44] he couldn't do anything about it to
[1:35:46] change them and you see people today are
[1:35:48] trying to fix the
[1:35:50] world amen you see people in America
[1:35:53] they're saying let's save America and
[1:35:55] we'll make the nation great again and
[1:35:57] and you know you know especially the
[1:35:58] conservative right there they're very
[1:36:00] vexed by the Liberals and they're very
[1:36:02] vexed by the gay marriage and all these
[1:36:04] things that have come into the country
[1:36:05] and that's worldwide there's actually a
[1:36:07] lot kind of people that are vexed and
[1:36:10] they're trying to trying to redeem the
[1:36:13] place trying to make it better but they
[1:36:15] won't do it and they can't do it amen
[1:36:18] and sure we should be vexed as well cuz
[1:36:20] them that seal receive the Seal of God
[1:36:22] sigh and cry for the Abominations done
[1:36:24] in the city so we should be vexed about
[1:36:26] the wrong we should speak about the you
[1:36:28] against the wrong but we shouldn't let
[1:36:31] it entangle
[1:36:32] us amen because he was entang he
[1:36:35] couldn't get out of Sodom of his own
[1:36:36] strength you know you read the story The
[1:36:38] Angel literally grabbed them by their
[1:36:40] hands and pulled them out the two angels
[1:36:42] literally grabbed them and pulled them
[1:36:44] out of the city they were going to
[1:36:46] stay amen and and and and the fire was
[1:36:49] about to fall
[1:36:52] so lot he couldn't he couldn't you know
[1:36:56] and then you see you see people there as
[1:36:58] I said they're vexed and that's why be
[1:37:00] careful what you focus on Amen if you
[1:37:04] focus on the wrong thing like I you know
[1:37:06] you know some people get so caught up in
[1:37:08] you know things like abortion that's a
[1:37:10] terrible thing of course it is but some
[1:37:13] people get so fixated on it that's all
[1:37:15] they see in Life or they see the gay
[1:37:17] marriage problem they just get so
[1:37:18] fixated on it that's all they see how
[1:37:21] wrong the rest of the church world
[1:37:23] is amen and they just get fixated and
[1:37:27] they get bitter about life cuz that's
[1:37:28] all they look at you're looking at the
[1:37:30] wrong thing if lot looked at the right
[1:37:33] thing he would have gone up where
[1:37:35] Abraham was when's mestic coming amen
[1:37:38] when's the promised son coming
[1:37:41] Hallelujah he should have been looking
[1:37:42] at that the promise for the age but
[1:37:44] because he was a make believer he didn't
[1:37:46] see the Promise and he didn't I don't
[1:37:48] think he must not have hung around
[1:37:49] Abraham long enough or really spoke to
[1:37:52] him and asked him what's this all about
[1:37:54] why are we making this road trip
[1:37:57] amen why didn't he just sit down and say
[1:38:00] what's this all about I need to know
[1:38:02] amen he should have done that and if he
[1:38:04] done that he would not have ended up
[1:38:06] there I believe
[1:38:08] that so so he was vexed and he was stuck
[1:38:12] because because you know lot was sitting
[1:38:15] by the gate of the city when when the
[1:38:18] Angels came in and the Gate of the city
[1:38:20] is very important place in in uh
[1:38:23] especially in the Old Testament because
[1:38:24] the Judgment was always at the
[1:38:27] gate and we can see this with Daniel
[1:38:30] Daniel and uh Daniel 248 and then uh the
[1:38:34] king made Daniel a great man and gave
[1:38:36] him many great gifts and made him rule
[1:38:38] over the whole province of Babylon and
[1:38:40] the chief of the governors over all the
[1:38:42] wise men of Babylon then Daniel
[1:38:44] requested of the king and he said
[1:38:45] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the
[1:38:48] Affairs of the province of Babylon but
[1:38:50] Daniel sat in in the gate of the king
[1:38:52] and you can see Absalon when he started
[1:38:54] his Uprising he went to The City Gate
[1:38:58] and then he actually caused all the
[1:38:59] people he said why are you coming here
[1:39:00] to see the king because of this
[1:39:01] grievance and this grievance says oh if
[1:39:03] I was a judge in Israel I'd do things a
[1:39:04] little bit differently amen and then
[1:39:07] Boaz when he went to redeem Ruth and
[1:39:10] Naomi he went and spoke to the elders at
[1:39:12] the Gate of the city so it was actually
[1:39:14] an important place so lot wasn't just a
[1:39:17] Joe average you know in Sodom he was he
[1:39:20] was the head guy he was one of the
[1:39:22] leaders of the place that's why he was
[1:39:25] in the gate so he was a man of great
[1:39:27] influence but his influence didn't do
[1:39:29] any
[1:39:30] good amen even though he wanted it to do
[1:39:35] good so lot now remember Jesus said
[1:39:38] remember Lot's wife there's a reason why
[1:39:41] he said remember Lot's
[1:39:44] wife and the reason the reason that is
[1:39:47] so is because Lot's wife she he just had
[1:39:51] one look back remember here came here
[1:39:54] came the time where the Angels were
[1:39:56] going to grab them and pull them out of
[1:39:57] the
[1:39:58] city and then the angel
[1:40:01] said haste thee Escape hither for I
[1:40:04] cannot do anything till thou be come
[1:40:06] hither therefore the name of the city
[1:40:08] was called zoah uh the sun was risen
[1:40:11] upon the earth when lot entered zoah
[1:40:14] then the Lord reigned upon s gomor
[1:40:17] Brimstone and fire from the Lord out of
[1:40:19] heaven and he overthrew those cities and
[1:40:21] all the plain and all the inhabitants of
[1:40:23] the cities and that which grew upon the
[1:40:25] ground but his wife looked back from
[1:40:27] behind him and she became a pillar of
[1:40:31] salt now this this word z z z however
[1:40:35] you pronounce it the meaning of this
[1:40:38] remember they were they were people of
[1:40:39] influence in in in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:40:41] they people of influence but this place
[1:40:44] they escaped to the meaning or the
[1:40:47] Primitive root of the word is to be
[1:40:48] small that is to be brought low and it's
[1:40:52] figuratively to be uh
[1:40:55] ignorable and that so that's IG n o b e
[1:40:58] how you pronounce that word and that is
[1:40:59] to be of of humble origin or social
[1:41:02] status to be humble amen so they had to
[1:41:05] flee to a place which was a humble place
[1:41:08] as actually speaking now that lot and
[1:41:10] his family had to Humble themselves and
[1:41:12] bring great people and go and and go
[1:41:15] down to a humble place you understand
[1:41:17] they had to Humble themselves not think
[1:41:19] themselves anything to to escape the
[1:41:24] fire but then lot Lo uh Lot's wife
[1:41:27] looked back and Jesus said remember
[1:41:28] Lot's wife all she had to do you know
[1:41:32] all she did was look back cuz I told
[1:41:35] don't look back just run run to that
[1:41:38] place but she looked
[1:41:41] back and
[1:41:44] so this is in this is in Jehovah Gyra
[1:41:47] part 3 and 62 notice now the so so
[1:41:50] notice now the word being so important
[1:41:53] and notice another while we're on it lot
[1:41:57] Jesus said himself remember Lot's wife
[1:42:01] if the word isn't so important if
[1:42:03] reasoning is all right when that angel
[1:42:06] said to lot and his family go to zor but
[1:42:08] don't look back and Lot's wife on a
[1:42:11] little insignificant thing as to turn
[1:42:13] back and look back but it was contrary
[1:42:15] to the words you turned to a pillar of
[1:42:17] salt then you say telling woman about
[1:42:19] cutting hair wearing clothes God said
[1:42:21] don't do it you follow the word and lot
[1:42:24] had no doubt a nice wife but she didn't
[1:42:26] follow the the Commandments to the word
[1:42:29] lot Eve was a good woman but she didn't
[1:42:30] follow the Commandment of the word just
[1:42:33] reasoned a little with it isn't it
[1:42:34] reasonable brother Brandon that we
[1:42:36] should do this I'm an American citizen I
[1:42:38] have a right to do whatever I want
[1:42:40] that's my American privilege it's your
[1:42:42] American privilege but it's not your
[1:42:44] Christian privilege for by Christian we
[1:42:46] are a sheep and a sheep ful fits its
[1:42:49] rights it lays still and let you take
[1:42:51] away from it all the rights it has but a
[1:42:54] goat will kick up a storm about it
[1:42:56] that's right but a sheep ful fits its
[1:43:00] rights amen so that's why Jesus said
[1:43:03] remember Lot's wife don't look back amen
[1:43:06] just run that's all they had to
[1:43:09] do so lot
[1:43:12] remember lot escape the fire because of
[1:43:16] Abraham interceding for
[1:43:18] him amen and so we we can see people who
[1:43:23] are you know you know as I said if you
[1:43:26] I'm not trying to call anyone a lot or a
[1:43:29] make believer an unbeliever I'm not
[1:43:31] that's not my interest I'm saying if you
[1:43:34] feel people in that position you pray
[1:43:36] for them amen and never come overbearing
[1:43:39] on people remember Jesus was the meekest
[1:43:41] lowest person amen and you can only help
[1:43:45] someone if you actually come underneath
[1:43:48] them amen you can't say now this is this
[1:43:52] and this and this and this and this is
[1:43:54] and look what I know and all they look
[1:43:55] at look at me that doesn't help anyone
[1:43:59] amen but if you come underneath them
[1:44:01] come alongside
[1:44:02] them amen then you can actually help
[1:44:07] them you
[1:44:09] see so Abraham was called lot was not
[1:44:13] called I just read the scripture and
[1:44:15] I'll
[1:44:18] close now remember the righteous so so
[1:44:21] lot he was vexed with the filthy
[1:44:24] conversation of the wicked but this is
[1:44:26] such a contrast to
[1:44:29] Abraham so when when remember God wrote
[1:44:32] through Peter to write about lot and God
[1:44:34] wrote through Paul to write about
[1:44:36] Abraham he says by faith Abraham when he
[1:44:39] was called to go out into a place which
[1:44:41] he should after receive an inheritance
[1:44:43] obeyed and went out not knowing whether
[1:44:45] he went and by faith he sojourned in the
[1:44:48] land of promise as in a strange country
[1:44:50] dwell ding in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:44:52] Jacob the the ears with them of the same
[1:44:55] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:44:57] had foundations whose Builder and maker
[1:44:59] is God through faith also Sarah herself
[1:45:02] received strength to conceive and was
[1:45:04] delivered of a child when she was past
[1:45:06] age because she judged him faithful who
[1:45:08] had promised therefore sprang there even
[1:45:11] of one uh and him as good as dead so
[1:45:15] many as the stars in the sky in
[1:45:17] multitude and as the sand which are by
[1:45:19] the sea innumerable these all died in
[1:45:22] faith not having received the promises
[1:45:25] but having seen them a far off and were
[1:45:27] persuaded of them and embrace them and
[1:45:29] confess that they were strangers and
[1:45:30] pilgrims in the land for they uh that
[1:45:34] say such things declare plainly that
[1:45:36] they seek a country and truly if they
[1:45:39] had been mindful of that country from
[1:45:41] when they came out of they might not
[1:45:43] have had the opportunity I mean they
[1:45:45] might have had opportunity to have
[1:45:47] returned for now they desire a better
[1:45:50] country that is and Heavenly wherefore
[1:45:52] God is not ashamed to be called their
[1:45:54] God for he has promised them a
[1:45:56] city that was that was when God was
[1:45:59] writing about Abraham but then you may
[1:46:01] say why did Lot's wife turn into a
[1:46:03] pillar of salt why didn't Sarah be
[1:46:06] destroyed when she laughed at God in
[1:46:10] herself amen because because Lot's wife
[1:46:13] she just un part of the word and she
[1:46:16] turned into a pillar of salt Sarah
[1:46:18] doubted the word and she wasn't
[1:46:20] destroyed why didn't she receive some
[1:46:22] you know it's because God's grace is so
[1:46:25] great that if you're part of the
[1:46:26] Covenant promise amen you may even doubt
[1:46:30] it amen you may even disbelieve it but
[1:46:34] God will cause you to believe it
[1:46:36] eventually that's right amen hallelujah
[1:46:39] because remember Abraham was called lot
[1:46:42] wasn't called and if Abraham was called
[1:46:44] that means Sarah was called amen Lot's
[1:46:48] wife wasn't called that's why she became
[1:46:50] a pillar of salt when she
[1:46:53] doubted amen so if you're part of the
[1:46:57] promise God will cause you to recognize
[1:46:59] you're part of the promise because she
[1:47:02] came to a stage where she judged him
[1:47:04] faithful that which had promised but
[1:47:07] before she didn't judge him faithful
[1:47:09] we're living out here Lot's wife is
[1:47:11] wearing the greatest Fashions here in
[1:47:13] SAR they're living it up in the High
[1:47:15] Life In The City we're out here on the
[1:47:16] Hills there's no good water our look at
[1:47:19] the state of our flocks and all the
[1:47:20] these bad things you know so she thought
[1:47:23] how's this ever going to happen Abraham
[1:47:25] are you sure you haven't gone mad look
[1:47:27] at but then eventually God came and
[1:47:30] visited her amen remember the revealing
[1:47:33] of the secrets of the hearts here in
[1:47:34] Genesis 18 that wasn't for Abraham that
[1:47:36] was for Sarah amen that wasn't for Abra
[1:47:39] he already believed but Sarah didn't
[1:47:41] believe amen how am I going to be what
[1:47:45] why are you calling me a different name
[1:47:47] I'm Sarah I'm not Sarah I'm not a
[1:47:49] princess with God how can I be a
[1:47:51] princess amen you'll find out one day no
[1:47:53] doubt Abraham would have thought in his
[1:47:55] heart why why do I have to call you
[1:47:57] Abraham what do you mean father of
[1:47:58] Nations how are you your F you're just
[1:48:00] Abraham what do you mean call me a
[1:48:02] different name one day he would have
[1:48:04] thought one day and then brother said
[1:48:07] when Abraham was there he knew the
[1:48:09] visitation was
[1:48:11] coming and he just kept the spiritual
[1:48:13] atmosphere around himself and he knew he
[1:48:16] knew it was coming because Sarah was
[1:48:18] acting up there was hard in the camp
[1:48:21] things were going wrong but he says he
[1:48:23] kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:48:26] amen he didn't let those things drag him
[1:48:28] down into those problems amen and then
[1:48:31] so he waited and then he saw three men
[1:48:33] walking Hallelujah then he recognized
[1:48:36] one was God Amen and then after that
[1:48:39] meal and then God said where is your
[1:48:41] wife Sarah she's in the tent behind you
[1:48:43] you know according to time of life now
[1:48:45] that's a woman according to time of life
[1:48:47] you going have the promised son she
[1:48:48] laughs within herself how can I have the
[1:48:49] promised son
[1:48:51] and then God says why did Sarah laugh no
[1:48:53] I didn't laugh he said yeah you did amen
[1:48:56] that whole that whole there that whole
[1:48:59] bit there was for Sarah it wasn't for
[1:49:02] Abraham but Abraham kept himself in a
[1:49:04] spiritual
[1:49:06] atmosphere because he knew his wife
[1:49:09] needed a
[1:49:10] visitation amen you may see the same
[1:49:14] thing because no doubt she would have
[1:49:16] said why do we have to live up here I'm
[1:49:18] sick of live 20 5 years you've been
[1:49:20] telling me about this promise it was so
[1:49:23] much nicer where we were we're in the
[1:49:25] because they were from the plains there
[1:49:27] in there in Iraq M Iraq water well
[1:49:29] watered Plains and now they're living up
[1:49:32] on these Hills in Judea or whatever was
[1:49:34] called 25 years I be look at our cattle
[1:49:38] why I thought you were a Shepherd you
[1:49:39] have all these people under you why are
[1:49:41] we living on this piece of dirt he just
[1:49:44] kept himself in a spiritual
[1:49:46] atmosphere amen what a challenge that is
[1:49:49] and that can be vice versa as well I
[1:49:51] mean husband what you
[1:49:54] know but he he knew she needed a
[1:49:56] visitation and then but then if he
[1:49:59] responded if he responded you know to
[1:50:02] her you know shut up woman I'm sick of
[1:50:05] this I'm Abraham father of Nations God's
[1:50:08] visited me I'm his Prophet amen would
[1:50:12] never have
[1:50:13] happened
[1:50:16] amen and and that's
[1:50:18] why we you know
[1:50:20] things go wrong at home at work your
[1:50:23] workmates May how's this ever going to
[1:50:25] happen with you and they get all
[1:50:26] stressed about it I just think y maybe
[1:50:29] I'm too relaxed but hey they say you're
[1:50:31] just too chilled out why should we get
[1:50:33] stressed about
[1:50:35] things amen you commit it to God you do
[1:50:37] your best you don't be you know you you
[1:50:40] know you know you don't be lazy about it
[1:50:42] you know Friday at work it's always a
[1:50:44] stress day but then I realized well it
[1:50:47] doesn't have to be a stress but everyone
[1:50:48] has in their mind oh Friday you know
[1:50:50] everything's going to go wrong and
[1:50:52] stuff's du and all this stuff I just
[1:50:53] thought to myself why why do we have to
[1:50:56] be stressed why do we have to be worked
[1:50:57] out about you know you know worked up
[1:50:59] about Friday you don't have to be just
[1:51:01] because everyone else is you know don't
[1:51:03] don't go into their realm remember we
[1:51:05] have something they don't have we
[1:51:07] actually have the Lord amen and and they
[1:51:10] all get worked up because they're
[1:51:12] thinking through this you know you know
[1:51:14] through the human thinking and sure
[1:51:15] everything may go wrong it may be a
[1:51:17] disaster but worry has no virtue faith
[1:51:21] has virtue amen well why believe because
[1:51:25] Faith might deliver me or faith might
[1:51:27] help me what's worry going to do worry

[1:51:50] bear their approach of living up in the
[1:51:51] hills you know having having his flocks
[1:51:55] not go well you know all those things
