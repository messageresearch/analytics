impossible and i want you to think if there's anything impossible in your life that you know you cannot accomplish and you know that no human no nothing can accomplish other than god i want you to just grab a hold of that promise as we sing and i just pray that god will bless you and you know this is a an answer to a burden and i believe i'll just tell you this but quickly as you know i was praying i'm praying a lot for the young people in the message and for the elect to come to their position and you know we look at all the impossible scenarios and we think i cannot do this none of us can do it but he can and i said to the lord one night i said lord this is impossible what can we do lord and he said not by power nor by might but by my spirit amen and so and he sent me to zechariah 4 and he says see that mountain zerubbabel it shall be made a plane and i'm going to do the impossible and what you all these things that you see that may be impossible you watch what god can do see what my god can do see how much my god can save amen because he's got power amen he wants to release that power and i believe tonight you can receive that and if whatever promises are for you that you

[Music] [Music] i felt [Applause] praise the lord i really enjoy can you tell me down a bit man i really enjoy the um items that different people give because you can tell when it comes from somebody's heart you know there's often um songs you know the brother ben calls it kane sacrifice you know in the sort of denominational churches do their big thing and you know and the music's always very good you know but it's sort of the the look puts you off right and he he's like oh just looks like kane sacrificed to me you know trying to offer up something to god but and there's a there is truth to that but will do the same song and i'm like man that's such an anointed amazing song but it's it's from her heart you know and it's i don't know how to describe it but it's different and you know brother andy when brother andy sings the songs come from his heart and and that's what that's what blesses us as we we we can feel it we sense it so i'm glad so glad for that okay we've just got one more and then we'll do some worship songs um the next one yep this one here was um i was going through this very bad situation who's been through a few bad situations really i thought i was the only one and i went back around behind my water tanks and i just didn't know what to do and i was just overwhelmed by the situation and then this little virtue came straight to my head with this song and it said if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you'll make it all he'll make it all make it all right and it was a and and that's what i try and do these days when we when i get in a situation just let go and give our trouble to jesus he'll make it all right somehow he'll make it all right amen okay just let me remember how this goes if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you make them all you make them all make them more right looking up ahead in the distance it's hard to understand that every move and every step you've waited in your hand so many times i wished i could do it all again so many things that i know now that i wish i knew back then life has got a way to bring us to our knees it's funny when we lose it all we gain everything if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you make them all you make them all make them more right if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you'll make them all you'll make them more make them more alright i remember when i thought it was easy i thought i knew the way shoulders back and my head raised up in the cool breeze on my face but then as the miles they rolled on heart aches and broken plans sitting on the side of a dusty road with my head down in my hands life has got a way to bring us to our knees it's funny when we lose it all we gain everything but if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you'll make them all you'll make them all make them more if you just let go let jesus take your troubles you'll make them all you'll make them all make them more right like the desert

[Music] dear lord jesus lord such a privilege to come as a body of believers lord for another year of special meetings on a weekend such as this lawn father we are so thankful lord that you have by your grace provided this time and made it possible lord for those of us who are gathered here to be able to come and spend time in your presence in a setting such as this over this weekend lord god father we ask your special blessing lord upon all the services lord two meetings have come lord i have not heard those meetings but i believe they were an immense blessing to all those that tuned in all those that were here lord god we pray for the continuation of the services a couple of days ahead lord god that you would bless them mightily each service father would tie in so perfect with that which went before it and that which will come after it we pray lord god lord we are here to welcome you the services law the meetings our time together is all about you father it's not about a man projecting himself we are not here to compete lorne really farther than an hour late so late is this how can we do anything else but desire to draw closer to you fallen and for you to have the utmost preeminence in our lives lord god we realize fathers the word is made so plain before us we see our humanity we see how our flesh often obstructs you from being able to achieve your your purpose and its fullness in our lives are gone but yet knowing at the same time we are precisely where we are supposed to be for the time we are living in and that nothing will hinder you lord from bringing us to the full potential that you have called us to that is our consolation father all things are precisely on time nothing is behind and nobody is ahead we are exactly where you want us to be we thank you for a time such as this thank you for the worship tonight lord khan the songs that were sung lord the excitement and the anticipation of the people father we pray that you would receive the glory tonight you would be magnified that you would touch each heart lord god i pray lord above all things law that for all of us we could realize the urgency and lightness of the hour lord this is not a time to fall around and father we can feel it in the atmosphere the hour is short and the time to go home is very soon lord may you strip away from us all that is not of you the lord god all that would be there is the character of jesus christ radiating through us father we ask these things in your precious name of jesus christ amen amen praise the lord while you're standing saints before i pass greetings and so forth we'll take our scripture um and i want to thank your musicians all the talent and the singers all the talents and so forth while you're standing if you would like to take your bibles this evening to revelation chapter seven we're going to read two scriptures tonight i must say i marvel at the efficiency of the deacons they they they are the best deacons i have seen as far as how they they think in advance about the needs of the minister and all the variables that might arise it's it's it's very very good revelation chapter 7 we want to read from verse 1 to verse 3. the scripture says john speaking and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads amen you see even the angels receive greater instruction amen revelation chapter 13. verses 16 and 17. is that me the scripture says and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name now notice in revelation 7 there is an angel who's going forth seal to mark a people and now in revelation 13 here is another class who are being sealed who are being marked amen let's let's pray one more time gracious father lord take these two scriptures tie them together for the time that we are living in lawn for this day we are seeing that a portion of the scripture is fulfilled even now and a portion is yet to be fulfilled in the tribulation the lord god we want the holy spirit to move tonight and lord god touch every life there are those here who are sealed there are those here who are not sealed father and lord by election your holy spirit can move and will move and accomplish its eternal purpose father we ask your blessing on the service now as we go into the scriptures lord keep us sharp may we follow the continuity of the word and lord may we just be excited to go forth from this building to have the privilege and the honor to live in the age that the forefathers long to live in of the great catching away of the bride of jesus christ without seeing death we ask these things in jesus name amen amen god bless you may be seated this evening amen my subject this evening is that which i preached last in our home church sealed into god's system and locked out of the beast system sealed into god's system and locked out of the beast system and before we go any further i want to extend a special thanks to shekinah tabernacle for the past six years i understand of camp meetings that they have had i understand here in otaki we think over the past six years saints we have had various ministers who have come and stood here and preached the word or over in the basketball stadium area meetings have been preached and many different people have come to these meetings over the years lives were touched lives were the livin people received the holy ghost all sorts of things have happened over the years through the the meetings that have been established here and we have all been greatly blessed by those things and i want to say to you as a church and especially to brother ben as the pastor god bless you all and may the lord richly reward you for the time and the effort and the finances that you have put into meetings such as this and whether you know it or not lives have been touched and impacted and forever changed in small ways and great ways that we will not know about until we get on the other side and so i say that because saints i don't know if there will ever be another meetings like this again and so here is an opportunity tonight to say to shekinah tabernacle god bless you and thank you for hosting meetings such as this over the years i do not know whether we will be able to gather like this as a body of believers by this time next year the time is short the pressure is on and i want to say thank you and god bless you richly for then let's give them a hand of thanks and appreciation for those things that they've done amen since i believe we are going home soon amen this is not something that we we thought was something nice to to to dream about as i say you can feel it in the atmosphere there is a pressure that you can feel coming on that is going to swing you based on your election one way or the other all seed will manifest and is being manifested in a time such as this and i for one was not expecting to be here standing tonight to speak i was coming to sit in the meetings as most of you are and i received the whatsapp message from brother ben asking if i had something if i could come armed and dangerous armed and dangerous for the meeting [Applause] and when i read his whatsapp message i immediately knew what to bring which is this thought and the reason why it was this thought is because i preached at last in the church on a wednesday night and it is very much burning within me because it's for this time it's right now you can see what i'm going to speak about tonight you can see it and i want to shake you up tonight we have some of the local saints here and in one form it's a reheat but in another form when you reheat the same meal all the juices have gone deeper and there's more flavor and there's a lot more to it and so i trust that for those who've already heard it that you would be blessed again and the lord would open up more things through this thought of being sealed into god's system and locked out of the beast system now i want to say to you tonight saints that when we look at the world today in october of 2021 we see a world that is changing with such rapidity that we cannot keep up with it and the politicians likewise cannot keep up with everything that is happening with such rapidity they can't contain it amen so what is acceptable today is suddenly change tomorrow and then reverse the day after because they are trying to contain events that are spiraling out of control in a world that we live in amen and it seems like the the normal that we once knew is gone forever the truth is it has the normal we once knew is gone forever we will never go back to the former things we once enjoyed those things are history saints we see that all events are engineered to bring the plan of god to pass the devil is having a field day under the direction of god amen to really make you ready for the catching away amen now if you look at the world today you realize that your life in the flesh has become highly restricted that the freedoms that you once enjoyed you cannot enjoy unless you follow certain criteria and so when you look at the world today it seems like what you want to do has now become impossible what you would like to do is now an impossibility it is out of reach and if you look through eyes of flesh you see a world that has made your life impossible it's made your life impossible looking at it through the eyes of flesh but if you are a son of god or a daughter of god who is anointed and indwelled by the spirit of the living god and whose spiritual eyes are anointed by the spirit of god you are looking at the same world as the man who looks at the world through the eyes of flesh and when you look at the world you marvel at how great the supernatural of god is to do what he said you are going to do and for you to go where he says that you are going to go in a time where the world says you cannot do these things now if you're looking at the world through eyes of flesh it's a world of impossibility but if you're looking at the same world with eyes that are anointed by the spirit of god you marvel at how god will do and perform his will in a way that you cannot conceive or imagine god is going to do something in a way that you have not calculated praise the lord and saint if you are in a state of fear and trepidation and unsurety about the future you need your eyes anointed by the spirit of god amen and the thing is things is that you can have the infilling of the spirit but this flesh likes to rise up and satan can anoint this flesh and your spirit realm and sow a seed of doubt to pull you away from seeing things how the spirit of god which is in you wants you to see the world amen so this evening saints it's to stir you up and have your eyes anointed to realize the time that we are living in do not look at this world and see impossibility see that this is a time of immense supernatural amen a time of immense supernatural praise the lord what i want you to understand tonight saints is in these scriptures that we have read from revelation 7 and revelation 13 that the whole world is being split into two camps those who are going to fall down and worship the beast all those who are going to fall down and worship the lamb you are going to either worship the beast or you're going to worship the lamb and there is no in between and the world today is designed to put you in one camp or the other by god's design praise the lord and the lamb is the lord jesus christ and the beast is satan himself who uses the powers of the world to exercise his dominion over the world that was given to him by god amen but understand it's god always at the top god is always at the top and tonight saints you are faced with a decision and at the end of these meetings you're faced with a decision whether you are going to worship the lamb follow the lamb and his will all fall down and worship the beast amen praise the lord now we see in the scripture there was a ceiling there was a ceiling of elected of an elected people and then there was a ceiling of those who were not elected and that's this time saints everybody is being sealed whether you believe this word is the truth or not does not change that you are being sealed to renounce the word is to be sealed to accept the word is to be sealed to embrace this word is to take the seal of god to reject this word is to take the mark of the beast amen there is no in between the seed what is in your heart will surely manifest this hour is designed to manifest what is in your heart amen now watch in the scripture that revelation 7 speaking of a sealing angel this ceiling angel is going forth and stealing jews but notice that where revelation 7 is put in the scripture is where the seven seals are written revelation six were the six seals revelation eight is the seventh seal and between revelation six and revelation eight is the seventh chapter talking about a ceiling angel sealing jews a jewish type is put in the bible where the story line of the seals are to do with gentiles but watch in revelation 10 we know the scripture a very famous scripture again we have the same angel the sealing angel who is jesus christ coming down with a book to seal a people and he's selling who gentiles but look at what is written around revelation 10. the ninth chapter is six trumpets the eleventh trumpet the the uh the eleventh chapter is the seventh trumpet and trumpets are to do with the jews and the prophet said what the seven seals are through the gentiles is what the trumpets are to the jews so where the seals are recorded which is to do with the gentiles a jewish type has put in other people being sealed and where the trumpets are speaking about the jewish people a gentile type has put in of the mighty angel coming down and sealing a people to show really what god is achieving in a time such as this there is an angel here who is christ himself ceiling of people before the wrath of god is released in its fullness the rest of god is here now in a minor form but will not be fully released until he that restrainteth which is a spirit of god and his bride is taken away praise alone and you see the same thing in the old testament in ezekiel 9 how that there were six angels i preached this in the local church and even in wellington recently or earlier this year slaughtering angels going forth to slay who those who did not have the mark of gods that's this time but before they could go forth by god's commission and destroy the ceiling angel the holy spirit went forth then after the elected are sealed then the slaughtering can take place praise the lord so in these last days god has seen a prophet who was a little man but in him was god himself he was not god but in him was god even as god is in you it does not make you god but it does make you god isn't that a paradox amen and that man who stood there and preached faithfully faithfully for your sake what was going forth on his words was the holy spirit and your response to that message is determining the world you are going to amen praise the lord now let us take our scripture of bibles and read from deuteronomy 8 verses 1 to 4. before moses died he we know that he was not to go into the land because he disobeyed the lord and smote the rock rather than speaking to the rock and the lord said because you have done this you will not go into the land so moses never went into the land but in revelation 11 he's in the land amen deuteronomy chapter 8 verses 1 to 4 moses is instructing the people as the prophet as the representative of god to the people he is speaking to them warning them and admonishing them before he goes off the scene and he says in verses 1 to 4 all the commandments which i command thee this day shall he observe to do that he may live and multiply and go in and possess the land saints if you are not possessing inheritance in your life follow the word go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers unto paul and to irenaeus martin and columba the apostolic fathers that which he swore unto them that their people would would enter into that he's going to keep his word he will keep his word by you keeping his word and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years have you been reflecting on the last six years of kim the way the lord has led have you reflected on the spiritual journey of your churches of your own individual lives when the lord touched you and the journey he took you on how the spirit dealt with you and how the lord chastened you and how the lord built you up and how he broke you down are you rehearsing your journey remembering these things thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years and for forty years they went in the wilderness by disobedience and the lord still led them when they refused to go into the land when they came to kirsh barnea the lord let them wonder 40 years because of disobedience and he led them in their disobedience amen now what about you tonight every phase and stage of your life when you followed god and walked away from god in all those things if you are a son of god a daughter of god you are being led by the spirit of god reflect on those things saints for even in your disobedience he is honing you and molding you and getting you ready for the great catching away amen to humble thee and to prove thee whether thou just keep his commandments or no verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed me with manna he allowed your economy to crumble that he might show you an economy that's greater and he fed there with manna which thou knewest not in other words things that had never happened before were now opened up by this pillar of fire was leading the people things that were spoken of and might be suddenly appeared that it never appeared before manna had never happened before quails had not appeared before water from the rock had not happened before god was showing there is a supernatural they are not calculated that came into effect when the need arise neither did thy father's know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live every breath you draw is by god's permission the mobility you have and the joints of your body is by god's permission the money in your bank the car you drive the house you live in is by the word of god and if he decrees tonight that it will burn down and be taken away it's by his word you will live by his words amen there is nothing you have nothing you do or will achieve that was you it was by god's words even the devil does all things by god's word verse 4 by raymond's wax not old now look at that we always have to change our clothing every few years our shoes wear out the shoes is the piece that we wear that probably wears out the fastest but here for 40 years there was preservation of footwear by raiment wax not old uponly neither did thy foot swell these 40 years there was a care being given the lord was watching over preserving and giving longevity because there was no mall in the wilderness there was no mall that they could go to to get new sneakers amen whatever clothing that you would like to wear or you're dreaming about buying in the near future there was nowhere in the wilderness to acquire those things so what they had because they were always on the move god had to preserve it which means there's another economy coming into effect when they have no means of procuring other things that's right that's for us amen but when they went into the land then their footwear wore out the clothing got tetted why because there was an ability in the land to make new footwear to make new clothing but when there was no ability to do that god preserved another economy came into effect you understand if you're walking in the ways of the lord in the word of the lord there is a higher economy that comes into play to meet need not want need amen and that is where we are moving into now saints what we enjoy now will be taken away that's what i'm speaking about today saints he has been with us this far he said i i took you 40 years through the wilderness i watched over you i preserved your footwear your clothing i fed you i watered you i have been with you 40 years he's been with us this far saying he will be with us till the end he's not going to just come on the scene he's been with you all these years people are wanting jesus to come on the scene he's been on the scene he's here and he will see you through he's not responsible for those who are not carrying his seal he's responsible for his wife who bears his spirit which is his life which is a seed he will see you through now if you can see that and get that to drop below your brains then you'll look at the world today and marvel at how the supernatural of god will maneuver your life in ways that you can't figure out now let me read a quotation of the prophet look away to jesus 1963 talking about the ecumenical world which was the church world where they were getting all you know you had to belong to associations in order to be able to intermingle and have church and he says it's tightening this is 1963 and then when the time comes and the press comes to a place the press comes to a place where you are pressed out that's your future saints don't hope for a change in the world you will be pressed else amen then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then watch the third pull then the third pull is not just the opening of the word and the revealing of the word it's god taking care of his people c and it will be absolutely to the total last the third pull and for the saved but it will be for the braid look at that it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the brain and the church amen what a paradox everybody gets to enjoy the third pool some are not going to enjoy it saints the squeeze is not coming here it's called a squeeze because what the word is is what it means squeeze means to squeeze it's not immediate full power application it's like a boa constrictor it winds or wraps around you and say once it's wrapped around you you can't get out it's got you and then it starts ramping up muscular pressure as it's ramping up it's pressured forcing all the life out of you that's the squeeze saints you know what we are not going to perish by this constrictor amen because the reality is this is the devil using what is happening in the world to wrap himself and try and squeeze the life out of this brain but the lord said through his prophet watch the third pool amen it's it's beyond our mental ability to try and figure out a way around the world today it's beyond me i'm not a smart person it's beyond me but i have a lot of confidence in the god i serve because he created everything and the prophet said they can't make one blade of grass they're building a rocket but a rocket is not even a a pinch of the complexity of a plate of crust and how god made that your god is very intelligent sense now why not trust in he who not only made the blade of grass but designed all the serpent seed to do what they are doing he's got absolute control now if you look at it that way why would you fear in a time such as this you could only be excited amen and if you're feeling fear that is normal in a flesh body that's unconverting to fear to fear because it's not converted the soul is but not the flesh not the spirit the soul is be that into a man feed that in a man's saints that what as you feed the inner man it brings flesh and spirit subject amen that's how it is feed the inner man right that's why if we look back to victories of history it was a ceasing of feeding in a man amen and if you desire to see greater things in your own life and a realization of your potential feed the inner man i can vouch where i fall short saints is a lack of fellowship with god a lack of feeding in a man a feeding of both worlds and enjoying of both worlds is what brings defeat that's what it is but i don't content myself that this is how i will stay and nor should you feed the inside man speak to the law follow the leadership of the holy ghost and see the change don't look for change in somebody else you want change in me and change in you amen now he says watch the third paul now this is it saints when the bride goes up the prophet thought this when we are caught away into glory satan is cast down from heaven he has access to heaven not as a a brother he has access as the accuser in heaven as he was seen in job one accusing job before the lord he is allowed into heaven to accuse we've seen the book of kings an evil spirit came up before the lord to do the will of the lord in causing the prophets to prophesy a lie to fulfill the word of god but when the bride goes up the accuser is cast down this is what i want you to see now the accuser is cast down and he will incarnate himself in a man because god wants to get into flesh satan wants to get into flesh god will incarnate himself in a people satan will incarnate himself in a man and we know in the scripture that that man he is called the false prophet and the false prophet is the pope because he claims to speak for god but his authority is not of god did not come from god he was not commissioned by god amen there's no pillar of fire following their man but there's a pillar of fire that was above the head of the true prophets [Music] satan will incarnate that man so the evil spirit that is on that last pope will leave that pope and satan will come into him amen that will be satan incarnate now watch in the book of revelation you read about the antichrist spirit the false prophet and the beast you read that if you read your bibles dust the cobwebs off and go and read it the antichrist spirit the false prophet and the beast the antichrist spirit is satan himself all his devils are antichrist spirits likewise but he is the chief one he is the the head of his fallen kingdom he is the antichrist spirit and when he is cast down the evil spirit in the pope will leave will vacate and satan will step into him the antichrist spirit satan goes into the false prophet making him the beast satan incarnate makes him the beast and when he incarnates him then he lays down the mark of the beast he lays down the mark of the beast but before that can happen you have to ascend you have to be pressed out as the prophet said amen now what is this laying down of mark i'm thankful that i got to preach this in our home church because then when the questions come it allows me to clarify for tonight we know things of god that the mark the seal of god is a spiritual thing the mark of god is a spiritual thing and likewise the seal of the beast this mark of the beast is a spiritual thing amen and in the bible the first one who was marked was cain and he was marked by god for refusal to offer even his abel orphan cain was not required to understand the reason behind the offering of blood he was required to apply the blood and that was it and if god will that he would provide understanding behind the offering of blood but cain could not take that wood and refused and was giving a spiritual offering the fruit offering was a spiritual offering but the the sacrificial offering always came first so he had the right offering at the wrong time he would not go in the order that god had ordained and he was marked by god a spiritual mark so what was in his heart manifested because he then slew his brother but god already saw his heart so watch today in this world you have a people seven billion people and most of them cannot receive the word they cannot they are already marked if they've heard the gospel and turned it down if they've heard the word i'm saying and turn it down they have been marked god knows their heart but now when they go into the tribulation what is in their heart manifests so that they will give remember the seal the mark was placed in the forehead and in the right hand speaking of thinking and action you see sayings if a time would come where they they put something like a chip in you or whatever those things only perversions that's not the mark it's only a perversion a submarine is only a perversion of a whale an aircraft is only a perversion of a bird amen it's only a perversion of what god has already done so at that time what is in their heart will manifest because what is happening is the world is being broken right now the economies are being broken by design and the prophet said the economy will be restored against gold but for that to happen the economy has to be broken so the world is being broken that the man of sin and who is incarnated by the devil can enthrone himself restore the world and to function inside that economy you must comply with their mandates their decrees that go contrary to the word and if your heart cannot receive the word you will comply you will complain that's the mark he will cause you that the only way you can function that world system and that world economy to transact is by you forfeiting the word for that that's in the tribulation but we are seeing the ushering in of it now the tribulation being actually then right now sings we are moving into it and the bride is taken away before it comes in its fullness praise the lord he sets down the mark you read that in 1963 under the first seal the prophet shows how that the spirit the that evil spirit and the pope will leave satan incarnates him amen the same thing it was with judas iscariot who betrayed the lord jesus amen the evil spirit left him and satan stepped into him and he sold out the lords praise the lord and so the bride is gone but before she's gone she's already pressed out of this world system she's still living on this earth but she can no longer function in the natural economy she's totally pressed down as the prophet said and that's why tonight my subject is sealed into god's system and locked out of the beast system amen this is where it is going saints whether you like it or not this is where it's going and this is why it's important these things get shared to realize we're not in some fantasy fairy tale the life goes on we have more camp meetings and and it's all wonderful it's decision time it's time to get real with god amen young and old get real with god you see saints if you don't have the seal of god you go into the tribulation now that's not to bring fear we serve god because we love god amen and you realize that the seal of god is given by the grace of god and if it's his grace it sealed you would you not want to serve him you didn't have to set an exam to receive the seal of god by his grace he gave that to you before the foundation of the world and the prophet said as long as there is a little something in your heart tugging for the things of god you have not crossed the dividing line between mercy and judgment amen so tonight saints if there is as long as there's something in your heart that is tugging at the preaching of the word it shows there's still hope to still hope saints amen praise the lord i'm thankful for the grace of god because i don't pass exams too well i don't study for starters i remember one sister said here if you're going to if you're going to see an example at least pray at least study you know you can pray the past exam at least study and when she said oh yeah that's true that's probably where i went wrong but you realize saints that there will be people in the tribulation that love the lord they'll love his word because you are his bride by election by grace by grace saints and in matthew 25 we find jesus gave the parable of wise and foolish virgins one one had the oil the other did not and since the oil was the spirit but both had the letter both had the word both had the message but one didn't have the spirit of the message one did not have the spirit of the word that is why they could not take a rapture amen so a true believer is not somebody that can explain all the deep intricacies of the word a true believer is they that have the spirit of god amen praise the lord there are many people who can explain going in the tribulation because they do not have the spirit of god god is only rapturing his spirit when he is saying that he sent his spirit down on the earth now he's come to collect the spirit which isn't a multi-member brain amen so these foolish virgins love the lord now think about it jesus is the great man that everybody wants to be married to because he is the absolute example of the male specimen amen now think in the natural world you might have a real dashing good-looking man muscular and and very fashionable and extremely intelligent and every girl that sees him likes him and loves him and and follows him and hangs onto every word he says and they would love to be his wife because he is everything that they want but you know what he chooses who his wife is and that man then goes and he selects some girl and he marries her and all the other girls they still admire this man and love this man and wish that he was their husband and and perhaps follow him on on instagram and twitter and all these things and so forth but you know what they never know his true heart amen they might hear the words that he's saying but they don't know his true hearts and his wife can be sitting there with all the other girls hearing him say a certain sentence and they hear it on a certain line but she knows exactly what he means that is the true believer amen many sitting in the message ranks hearing the lord jesus speak and they love the lord jesus but only the true bride with the spirit of god knows the heart of god or what is being spoken amen and that's the difference so those people because they were not sealed to take a translation they have to seal their testimony with their blood they love the lord jesus but he just didn't choose them it's his decision saints they're not bad people it's his decision they're not my bride they love me but they will seal their testimony with their own blood and you find there'll be people in the message like that and and nominal christians out in the church world who will not bow down to this system who they can see it wrong by the word but they do not have the spirit of the living god dwelling in them to shape their character for translation see that the grace of god chose you saints amen so here in the scripture in these last days saints when you press play when you open the book you are seeing and hearing the words of the ceiling angel amen which is jesus christ which is the holy ghost which is the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel through the wilderness amen and then we find that he is called jesus he's called melchizedek he's called michael we've been through these things before michael is jesus christ who is the giver of revelation the revealer of his word sorry the protector of his word the defender of his word but as gabriel he's the revealer of his word when you find gabriel in the bible he's always imparting understanding that's jesus giving out understanding the word being opened when the word is being preached that's gabriel the holy spirit speaking and then when god comes to back his word up that's jesus that's michael amen and forcing his word michael vindicating his word the same jesus in a different office isn't it simple isn't it praise the lord and the only thing that is preventing satan from having absolute draconian rule right now remember he's limited right now is because the angel the great archangel michael jesus christ is here on the earth amen his feet are on the sea and on the land and as long as his feet that's the part of his body that's contacting the earth as long as his feet are on this earth satan is limited in how far he can go with his great plan but where is the mighty angel today this this great one that came down from heaven who was suppressing the devil and limiting the power of the devil where is he he's in pride fall because when john saw him in revelation 1 he was like the son of man that was jesus in his brain when daniel saw him daniel 7 was the light one like the son of man jesus in his brain meaning that as long as you are on the earth satan can only go so far with what he can do in the world today but when you leave the earth and the holy ghost is dwelling in you in the holy ghost which is the spirit which is the blood of god leave the earth nothing can restrict the devil anymore amen so saints this is the time to get ready we are going home you soon to fall asleep tonight sleeping virgins or you want to tune in because we're going home soon the beast saints is a system but it will also be in man i've shown you how that the prophet even said he says a man without the holy ghost he is a beast unconverted man he is a beast you find nebuchadnezzar he glorified himself all that i have achieved all that i have built and all my glory and and with all the talent of my kingdom i built it and what happened to him he was given the heart of a beast the seven years and god taught him to look up god had to teach a king to look up the leader of a world empire look up amen the beast is a system and we know that because in daniel chapter 7 daniel had a dream and he saw a great sea which was a mediterranean sea and he saw empires he saw beasts coming up from the sea beasts a lion a bear a leopard and a dragon that represented world powers that rose up for a season did certain works and then declined and were broken before the next power rose up a lion a bear and a leopard babylon persia greece and rome rose and fell beasts amen so it's a system a world power and then in revelation 13 you know the scripture i'll read it to you so you understand notice daniel saw a beast he saw a lion a bear a leopard and a dragon but in revelation 13 verse 1 here is john now daniel is the old testament book of revelation now here is john sing the same thing and i john stood upon the sand of the sea even as daniel in his dream was looking at the scene and i saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy now watch verse two and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard one beast having the characteristic of a leopard and his feet were yeah they just stuck together the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion look at that what was babylon what was persia what was greece at the end time was all wrapped up into one power which is the modern roman power that you live under today that you function under in the natural today all the attributes and characteristics of those powers of history are all here today embodied in the last world power the beast saints is a system before it becomes a man right it's a beast it's the roman power that we speak about which is the world system today and then we find in the tribulation satan himself enthrones himself by stepping into the man who is the leader of that kingdom that's what makes him the beast you follow that praise the lord and what you're up against is this beast this power this power now watch nebuchadnezzar he also dreamt of those same powers but nebuchadnezzar saw them as metals of an image he saw that he saw he had a dream i want you to notice things see the communication that you know is your phone your internet your email but look how god was communicating nobody can shut this off you thought about it nobody can shut this off right you don't get buffering nobody shuts this off this is something far superior [Music] and he has a dream of an image of gold silver brass and iron metals to represent those same powers babylon persia greece rome but what nebuchadnezzar saw was the exterior the outward appearance of those powers but what daniel saw was the spirit of those powers he was the prophet when he was communicated by god and god communicated with him god showed him the spirits you might look at something and might look so beautiful but if god shows you the same thing you'll see the spirit of it amen and saints of god i believe i think the prophet said if you could see the spirit that was on a woman dressed up like a tart going up the street you would never look at her again that spirit is so hideous how we need to be tuned in to a god that can help you spot the spirit i tell you saints that will sort out any troubles you have man you have trouble so lord sensitize me to the unseen because you're going to need it nebuchadnezzar's dream described the outward daniel saw the spirit and in all things saints we look at the spirits it's what the word is it's a discerner of the spirit praise the lord we the brain we are living in an age within an age we are living in the bright age that's an age within laodicea so that all around you saints is laodicea and the spirit of the age is all around you and the spirit of the age in revelation 3 was for the age to be rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing it was a materialistic age the last age was the age of materialism and you as the bride living in the bright age within laodicea have the spirit of laodicea all around you trying to influence you and so saints if your desire at a time such as this in 2021 is all about natural success natural success is not sinful it's perfectly fine but if that's what drives you if that's you your foremost thing in life is to be successful is to achieve in the natural world you are under the influence of leodycia and leo decea that condition that she was in the bible says she knew not that she was in that condition the lord says you're wretched miserable poor blind naked in other words you're insane and we can agree this world is insane it's not going to be insane it is insane but because it's happening all around you and you're exposed to it you sometimes don't realize that that's insanity because it's just happening around you but that's the spirit of the age they cannot see its condition and if you get caught up under that influence saints you will not see your spiritual condition if laodicea could not see it you will not see it that's why you need to be under the word you don't come and sit under the word once you come back to the word again and again and again to look at yourself in the mirror of the word see where you're falling short to take that spirit at bay because until this has changed saints you're going to need to sit under it [Applause] the influence of laodicea and but the thing is the paradox what i i have to laugh at is that this is the materialistic age that consumes the people in a time where they're going to be stripped of all things you're not leaving this world with anything material things that's the folly of this time it's the folly of the age you're going to leave this world with nothing if you've got a nice two-story house and a ferrari in a twin port garage you're going to lose the lot and the church that you attend you're going to lose that too and your sound system and all your instruments and all the money in your bank you're going to lose the whole lot in the age of materialism as the bride of jesus christ who will not comply to the evil of this age when you are pressed out you will be pressed out with nothing but god and god alone now does that shake you up in your thinking this is not a game saints you will lose everything and that is reality if you choose to stand for this word you are going to lose everything watch in the bible we find that there was no more middle class written off in revelation 13. if you are rich now if you live an average life now just middle class or if you're poor now you will have zero even if you're poor you will have less than that because poor people have something they just don't have a lot of it that's why they're poor but the little that they do have they will not have and the much that you do have you will not have you will have absolutely nothing by god's decree not by the decree of the state not by those evil people and government by god's decree saint if you have a problem with that go and take it before the lord he is the one that has set this decree that you are going to leave the earth with nothing of this earth praise the lord this future has been fixed by god established by gods to do what to lock you out of the beast system in order to lock you into god's system to lock you out of the beast's economy that he might lock you into his economy amen right now that you just taste of it here and there you see the lord come and provide here and there you only have a little dependence on the lord as long as you've got money in your bank you find that you don't depend on the lord that much when nothing saints that's why you see greater faith in the third world greater faith they have nothing so they rely on another economy their economy is finished no hope for the third world economies there's no hope for l1 but you've got something now and you find that the age of laid a seer makes you not so dependent on god so god will allow it to be all stripped away that what is within you will make you so connect with him praise the lord this has been fixed with god by god without the mark of the be saints you will not be allowed to carry out your day-to-day life in the world that we know today but without the mark of god you will not be able to function in god's economy you have a choice which economy which system you want to comply with you want to yield to submit two that's your choice tonight what system what world do i want to give myself completely over to because nobody is going to be in between you god has a requirement my mark the beast has his requirement my mark and whatever one you take that is what allows you to transact the transactive power of the spoken word is only for those with the seal of god and if you want to buy and sell and still have a bank account soon saints you're going to have to bow down to the beast that's the reality god wants to show you that there is an economy so great so much more superior so stable that he wants you to enjoy so he has to arrange things in our world to get you in tune with it signed up to it amen saints in this age the world is requiring many things of us you know you see it in the papers you need to have this in order to be able to do things god requires something too he requires his token to be on display if you want to be able to move about in the vastness of what he has made available he requires something to saints he requires his seal his spirit and i heard a profound thing of brothers in our church just on wednesday night he said the token in you applies itself the token must be on display the holy ghost the token in you which is the holy ghost will display itself amen it will display itself now watch saying i'm going to read you a scripture from acts chapter 8 to show you how that there is a world far greater right here right now amen there is an economy that is not going to come into existence it's already here and this scripture let's look at from the book of acts which again was a historic account of what god is doing again in the last days and in acts chapter 8 we read about philip and philip had a communication that was far superior to the communication of his day all the smoke signals and the ponies that were going back and forth and and the pigeons that later came and flew messages he had something far superior and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying and watch the exactness of the angel arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem to gaza this is a god who knows geography saints he actually knows the roads that you took to get here amen and what is going to be achieved by you taking that road so he's giving very specific instructions to philip go the specific way down from jerusalem to gaza which is desert and then philip just a base then question the lord then go and pull out a map to verify that everything was still as as the lord said and there'd be no changes redrawn on the map since god at last looked at the map god is god and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia and unit god never told him about the ethiopian he just said go i want you to take this route go didn't tell him that there would be a man that he was going to have interaction with and lead to the lord he just says i want you to walk god is not obligated to explain things to you saints when those angels were were sent forth in in revelation 7 to hurt the sea in the land they were just sent forth didn't tell them how long just go forth and hurt the earth and when i say stop that's when you stop amen so he goes down he finds us ethiopian a great man under the authority of candace queen of the ethiopians who had charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem to worship fought to worship and he was returning from jerusalem and sitting in his chariot reading isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and we find what unfolds from there is that he speaks and the ethiopian is asking what these things mean in isaiah and philip teaches him about the lord jesus which results in baptism and then in verse 39 as philip is coming out of the waters where he had baptized the ethiopian and when they would come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip he's not in a glorified body saints he's in a flesh body the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more just gone and he went on his way rejoicing but philip was found at a zotus somewhere else gone put over here no passport no passports amen he did not need anything of this world to be able to travel when the spirit of the lord has decided where you are going to go and what you are going to do god will do it amen do you know why things are called miracles because they defy the laws of the natural world but miracles and natural laws of the unseen world that this world doesn't know about this is a man connected to something that that roman empire of his time knew nothing about he could be in a cell as we find peter was and doors which should not be opening at that time in history opened praise the lord think about that a supernatural transportation system gps tracking god knew where the unit was gone you're here philip didn't know you just you follow i'll take you right there god knows where every one of us are amen praise the lord god is wanting by his word to make you conscious that there is a greater economy saints of a superior civilization that already exists in the unseen oil it is not coming to be it is here right now saints and we are being sensitized to that reality the preaching of the word is to sensitize you not to educate you to sensitize you to connect you to the unseen world and to the god who controls the economy of that world think of this saint he controls the natural world it controls the economy of the natural world you're going to see that tonight he controls the economy of the natural world and he controls the economy of the supernatural world he controls both why do you fear yeah why are you so uns so uncertain if he controls both and and ordain that you would live in this time hasn't he got absolute control is he not absolutely aware of where you're at your needs what you're going through if you've got the seal of god and you've overturned each stone and you know there's nothing between you and your savior can't you just rest with that confidence praise the lord now watch i'll read one more scripture here you don't need to turn in one samuel 28 verse 6 samuel a saul got away from the word of the lord he disobeyed the lord he he did not hearken to what samuel instructed him to do and saul got to such a low place that the philistines came and they gathered against israel and and saul went to seek the lord and the bible says and when saul and quiet of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets god's communication system saints by visions dreams the word of god which is the urem therma of this age and the prophet of the age god speaks but you get away from the leadership of gods out of step with god the same prophets the same word will no longer give you direction you pick up the bible and get nothing you come to church you'll get nothing when you refuse to walk and obey you don't have to understand saints you're called to obey it's his responsibility to give understanding praise alone so here is god communicating with his children in the bible and god is doing the same thing today and if you're wanting to have that real fellowship with god where he can speak to you in a night vision speak to you out of his word speak to you in the meeting tonight speak to you via hearing the hearing of the prophet or the reading of the word just get performed and fellowship with them lay this down that you might be sensitized to a higher channel a higher channel oh i tell you when we go home and our flesh acts up it's a battle but you will get there i will get that i do not let anything in my life cause me to get the press because i have a vision of where god will get me and i know i will get there right when he wants me to get their sins amen so god god god has already said in revelation 13 the middle class will be gone rich and poor free bond nothing in between god said that yes god has said it no more middle class in other words i'm middle class i will not be middle class the rich are getting richer the power are getting poorer saints that's the way it is and god said that is the way it is you see i said that god has control of the economy of the natural world now i'll show you in the word how he controls it let me read 2 kings 6 24 and 25 and it came to pass after this that then a dead king of assyria gathered all his hosts and went up and besieged samaria and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass's head essa's head what sort of food is that was sold for four score pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver in other words worthless goods nobody goes to the shop to buy an asses head to eat but here it was now in high demand and worth of fortune because of an economic siege and it happened because israel got away from the lord they got away from the lord and righteous people in that nation had to suffer because the king the leaders got away from the lord so the whole kingdom suffered you think all the animal kingdom has suffered because of eve's disobedience animals do nothing wrong saints they're under the effects of sin you're under the effects of sin but it was eve that disobey so when when the headship gets out from the wood everything in inside the under that in that kingdom will suffer but watch that was to king six verse 24 and 25 to kings seven verse one then elisha said yes hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow about this pain shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel and the gate of sumeria in other words prices that went up astronomically out of reach dropped in 24 hours 24 hours all the prices were plummet we're going to plummet by the decree of the prophet who is god's spokesman an economy changed by the decree of god through his prophet think of that so who and and we find as if you read to king seven what happened sirians were camped outside the city you realize that when you're surrounded in the city you can't get out nothing can come in so then the the food that you may have comes in shorts of play and now it's in high demand and now because it's the mind the prices go up because you can make more money when there's more demand now people can't afford and then when that's consumed there's nothing more to eat so the mothers are eating their babies what you read but then a decree came from heaven and there were some leopards that were standing in the gate of samaria and they said look if we stay here we're going to die why not let's just go to the camp of the syrians and see if we can get a feed and if we die there look we're going to die anyway let's try so they go and they find the camp of the sirians is empty they're gone because the sirians the lord allowed them to hear something that was not so the lord allowed them to hear things that weren't actually there they thought they had they could hear the sound of hoof beats sound of chariots and they thought that israel had hired the hittites and all the other heights all the purple tights and all these things who come against them and drive them out but god made them hear it and so they all left and when the lepers turned up at the camp of the sirians there was just so much food and they were they were no doubt tucking into it and then they can their conscience is pricked and they realize look hey there's a whole city there that's dying for a good feed maybe we should go back and tell the king so they go back and tell the king and these things were truly so and the food came into the city and the prices dropped and life returned to normal within 24 hours by the decree of the most high god who rose in the affairs of men [Music] and rules in your affairs so he has control of the economy and now we find in revelation 6 under the third seal what does the bible saying and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i john beheld and lower black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four bc watch a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see they'll heard not the oil and the wine now the thing to understand is that these measures that have been spoken of here require a whole day's wages to purchase because in matthew chapter 20 jesus gave the parable of the man the head of vineyard that was had come to harvest and needed all the grapes to be gathered and so he hired laborers to go into the vineyard and he agreed with them for that a day's wage would be one penny a day's wage was one penny and so when he hired throughout the successive hours of the day that was the agreement a penny for the day's labor and now here in revelation 6 under the third seal he's showing you that what you earn in one day will buy you hardly anything and that's what you're witnessing in the world right now everything is going up and up and up and in america things are getting very very bad yes and it's getting it's starting their first because they rejected their profit and what starts there is going to hit our shores that's the third seal and that's all the economics and let me tell you all the virus and and and and with the the the americans the american economy giving the people a basic living allowance which was more than they were earning when they were working they're staying home which makes a labor shortage which has created a shipping crisis which means there's less coming on your shelves it drives the prices up to fulfill what god said would be who's behind all the transportation crisis and shortage of workers who who caused the american government to go and pay out the american people more than what they were earning when they were working god did because he has his word to bring the past but he said when i'm doing all this i will see that the oil and the wine those people who have the oil my bride who has my spirits and stimulated by the word amen that comes by my spirit will be looked after even as god took care of elijah took care of the woman of zarephath took care he takes care of his own but he will bring his word to pass it doesn't feel good for us to have to live in this time but he's saying i will take care of you amen so you see no saints the stock exchange the exchange rates every aspect of the financial system is controlled by gods and all the economists can study it and theorize about it and try and change it they cannot for what has been decreed by god what will be and so saints if that is so when you are stripped by the system which you will be it's by god's decree as god gave job permission to lose all his wealth as god gave satan permission to strip job of all his wealth and of his health everything that you have comes from god the bible says by him we have our movement in other words the fact that you can walk around and not have aches and pains in your joints comes from god everything you think you're so great the prophet says people you know they don't want god he says they just haven't got sick enough yet we've got no time but guys they haven't got sick enough yet they tell you what sayings when you're sick a billion dollars winning the lottery you know when i get the when i get a cold and i feel low to win the lotto wouldn't make me feel better i just want to be better i want to be well everything you have comes from him god's dealings with you with the economy of a nation is but a type of how god deals with your economy as a family as an individual amen how he deals with the nation is but an expansion of how he deals with you all of you every family here is a an economy you have money you have assets you are an economy put all the families together you have the national economy that's how it works so if god is in control of the nation he's in control of yours because it's all the family economies that make up the national one now watch this is what you have to be aware of because you're living in laodicea and laodicea is the age of materialism and the bible says in job 1 verses 20 to 22 when job was stripped of all things more than you will ever be stripped of saints not only did he lose his assets he lost his family he lost his children showing the local church when when a son or daughter dies you can't get them back when sharon rose died the prophet couldn't get her back when hope died he couldn't get her back amen if your car dies you get another car but you can't get that same child back or if your car dies you can rebuild that same car now watch when job lost all things then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped amen look at his attitude our example he fell down upon the ground and he worshipped god you realize saints that many times we can only worship god when we are feeling up to it joe was not feeling up to it but fell down upon the ground and worships and say naked king i out on my mother's womb naked shall i return to the the lord gave the lord gave and the lord the lord is taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all this job sinned knots how many people go into the world when things don't go their way oh when they see this one walked away and this one walked away that was supposed to be a devout christian and they go and sin against the lord but in all this job who had no explanation from god sin nots and when god restored all things to job god still did not explain to him the conference that went on in heaven when god came down and made visitation to job in the form of the whirlwind he never explained to job that in heaven lucifer came up and made a challenge and god accepted the challenge job went to the grave not knowing that you know it and joe probably knows that now that he's in glory but on the earth he did not know god is not obligated to explain why things that you think should go this way don't go the way you want and because they don't go the way you want is not a reason to determine how you serve god he's still gone still worthy of worship even when things go beyond what you think they should be see job was sensitized saints he didn't have a fraction of the understanding that you have if i tell you what he had something in his soul that carried him through amen we will take nothing material with us to the next world saints the car that you polish you're not taking with you anything that you hold dear to you saints you're not taking it with you not sinful to have those things not sinful in a house have a computer these things are perfectly fine don't worship them though but the reality is god gave them to you god's taking them from you you came into this world with nothing and you're leaving this world with nothing materialistic the only thing that you are taking from this world is character the only thing that you're taking is character and the character that you are taking is the character of jesus amen not the character of method not the character of ben or anybody other person here you're taking the character of jesus with you so you must go through things in this life disappointments in this life where you get disappointed with god you must go through that in your life to shape and fashion your character so that when you are put in the position of rulership you will rule with the wisdom of god amen praise the lord we are taking only character with us saints in this world we have the poor the middle class and the rich and among the believers it's the same we are sitting here tonight a varied group and some of us are very well off some of us might be rich other others of us may just live average lives and some of us may be poor that's the reality things whether you like it or not some of us here are doing very well some of us here just live average lives and some of us just struggle we just struggle we can't make ends meet and god decreed it will be that way god ordains it that way he purposes it that way just because you're the bride does not make him obligated to make you well off he chooses whether you're going to struggle scrimp and scrape all your life and if he's chosen that then be happy maybe makes you wealthy be happy and if you just live in average life be happy because the thing is saying before you leave this world whether you're rich middle class or poor you're not going to be any of those you're going to have nothing zero no matter you've got a million dollars now you're leaving the world with nothing in the bank account with no bank account you see brethren sodom could have made abraham rich you know that sodom could have made him rich because when when lot was taken captive and then abraham went out to rescue his brother his nephew lot in doing so he managed to bring back all the other captives and the king of sodom was so grateful and wanted to reward abraham with the riches of sodom but abraham refused why lest thou sayest i have made abraham rich so who gave abraham the riches who gave abraham influence who gave abraham position god did yes amen you realize that before the king of sodom came to abraham to offer him great sums great wealth melchizedek already got to him amen the king of sodom didn't get to abraham till the end of the chapter melchizedek got there right before him abraham met melchizedek he had met the god who made him rich he met the god who made him influential who gave him position and power and gave him a name that is remembered throughout the ages people want to be famous because they want to be remembered you know anything that we do with ambition we want to leave a legacy leave a mark on time but abraham let god do that yeah let god do it saints live your life just live your life live for the lord don't live to be anything of this world just live for the lord and if it's his will to give you other things let him do it but let him do it amen god made him rich god increased him with goods that's laid to see isn't it rich and increased with goods but here is god doing it praise the lord and in genesis 15 verse 1 when abraham declined the offer of the king of sodom the scripture says and after these things the word of the lord came unto abraham in a vision a night vision a dream saying fear not abraham i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward hallelujah i was telling the church if you serve god you are serving one who owns the cattle on a thousand hills his resources are in finites amen and if you end up getting a hundred dollars in your bank realize that he who gave you the hundred has access to unlimited but he for now he wants you to have the 100. and they don't see how everybody got a hundred dollars in the bank thanks the god who gave you the hundred has access to all things as resources and finite how can you ever come to a place where you have nothing how can you ever come to a place where where no bill could be paid if you are connected with god you are in line with god his resources are there for you and he is mindful of what you need of your situation and that is where you place your faith that's where you place your confidence in him when you learn to submit to god's will for your life and you allow him to make you either poor to lead an average life or be rich and whatever god allows you to be you will be content you've never seen an age like this where people are not content i thank my i thank the lord because i genuinely i don't care about money i'm not money hungry at all i'm not ambition to be rich i just love the lord i love his word and that's what i enjoy i don't make money doing it i have no desire to make money do i just love the lord and because of that the lord always provides always provides i don't plan scheme plots he just everything works out i still make mistakes like all all of us do basically god knows my heart i make a thousand mistakes but god knows my heart i could say like like david saying i am a very good repenter if i repent all the time i have lots to repent of and god loves that because often says we are gauging christianity by performance he doesn't look like a christian not acting like one today you know the word of god should be achieving all these great and mighty things but look at this person look at this person saints don't look at the exterior look at the heart the spirit the desire amen god can still use you with all your flaws in a mighty way you think you've done nothing wait till you get to glory and you see how god so intricately manipulated every event and you realize how god used you in your life if you're a son or daughter of god you're not put here to do nothing god is using you whether you are conscious of it or not god is using you you know what saints i remember you've all seen the ten commandments movie and there was that man in the mud pits and uh and uh he obviously wasn't performing and one of the egyptians threw a a piece of wood at him you remember that and struck him and he dropped down in the mud and and moses was still prince of egypt at the time you know covenant mud came over to him and picked him up and sort of held him in his arms and and the man was dying and and you as he was taking his last breath he expressed his disappointment in god that he never got to see the deliverer but there was moses the prince of egypt covenant mud holding him in his arm and the last thing that man saw in the movie of course was was moses but the man wasn't conscious that god had heard his prayer and that was the last thing he saw and he went to the grave died disappointed but god saw it god answered it only a movie scene but it struck me how that you pray for things and you expect the fulfillment of those things a specific way and god fulfills them and you go to the grave or you go to glory not conscious god god saw the whole thing and answered it brother dean gilchrist who i was in his church a few years ago and he recounted experience that he had where he he experienced the presence of the lord he said in a very very real way in the realest way he's ever experienced in his life and he said in that presence he said there was total satisfaction that's what struck me about what he said he said in that presence you see there was just total satisfaction amen it didn't matter what what your needs were amen whatever you were going through in the presence of god there was just peace there's just peace and so saints you go in your life through all sorts of things that that play with your emotions all kinds of ways but go in the presence of god and stay there until the peace of god comes upon you then get up off your knees and get back into living your life because the presence of god will bring the peace of god amen even though you can't work it out he's still god a man who has connected with god and in fellowship with god is a man who is content with his lot in life you're not comparing what you have with what she has what he has you're just thankful for what god has done for you amen if you think you're the most untalented person be thankful that god made you that there's no body ungifted saints it's just that you think you're that way because you compared yourself with somebody a man in fellowship with god is content you realize saints of that beast that power that roman power and daniel chapter 11 the bible says that he divides the land for gain you know that scripture the roman power would divide the land for gain and and you see that how that the whole world was broken up into trading zones and economic blocks throughout the 20th century and in all that it's still not satisfying because the bible said that roman beast and daniel 7 will devour the whole earth so you think that if you attain a certain thing or buy a certain thing you get the latest phone you get a certain car that you'll be content no you'll be looking for more wanting more more more why you're not in the presence of god you're under the influence of laodicea that's a roman spirit saints that's a beast spirit it's an insatiable spirit can never be satisfied and so it keeps devouring and what happens things you start looking at what other people have you want to take you want to start breaching your boundaries breaching the territory god gave you and start taking things out of other people's land don't do that you see when we look at a man all of us all of us have a hunger and a thirst i'm winding down all of us have a hunger and a thirst from birth amen because you are flesh you are natural man and you're a spiritual man and you have to realize that what your hunger and thirst force part of it is of the flesh and part of it is from the soul but we put it all together and say this individual this man this woman they have a hunger they have a thirst they have a desire in them but if you're unconverted in the flesh you go after the things of the flesh in the natural world you want success you want to be you want to be married you want to have children you want to have a house better car boats you want to expand your business you're of the flesh thinking that by the attainment of these things you will find satisfaction you'll find the quenching of this but you find that by the attainment of those things you are not satisfied because you don't realize the depth of that desires coming from the soul and the soul is never satisfied by things of the flesh never it must be minutes ministered to by the supernatural but if you if you get the you need to get the order the right way and minister to the soul first minister to the soul first that will curb your hunger for the attainment of flesh things young people going through school or about to leave school or starting out in life feed satisfy the hunger of the spirit man the word man you'll find the ambition will not be as prominent you'll find now you want the will of god and not your will we want the will of god saints i look back in my life and i wanted to be a policeman i applied to be a policeman and i got through most of the selection and i was not allowed in and i was disappointed by jeremiah in 2021 i look at the world today and if i became a policeman i would be required to enforce things that go contrary to the word at the time i was very disappointed that was my goal that was my dream but god it is he that walks through the seven church ages he is seen in the midst of the candlesticks he moves back and forth through time he could see 2012 and 2021 and he knew what was best for me amen and now i look back at that i said thank you jesus i never became a policeman because there's no way that i would be doing what they require me to do you put your trust in him saints whatever you want to do in your life whatever you want to be you put it before the lord put it before the lord then you can live a life of peace and contentment and spiritual progress hallelujah minister to the soul we find solomon he was the richest man who had all things all the wives all the chariots greatest military most wealth most asset everything he says in ecclesiastes one verses one to three the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem vanity of vanities you know what vanity is it's just it's just a vapor is this vapor the phone that you once had is no longer yours maybe you broke it burn said well lost it it's a vapor a memory sayeth the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity all is vanity all this nice gear one day be dust a memory what prophet hath a man of all his labor what she taketh unto the son all that you've worked so hard for built yourself up to be to result in a little etching in a tombstone in a cemetery that nobody will read about your family once in a while without christ saints that's all you'll be all that you have achieved in your life will become some granite tombstone that will age and grow moss on it people walk past it it will be forgotten it's nothing but this this is no value since it's not 10 000 worlds it's it's beyond value this is what we need to focus on solomon who had all things he knew that the supernatural part is what must be ministered to he was the wisest man saints wisdom his wisdom was discernment and god gave him wisdom he gave him the sermon that's why when the prophet preached a greater than solomon is here he was talking about the discerning angel jesus christ himself who was here a few musicians would come i want to read the last quote i like this quote and i heard this recently the prophet told his life story and i like hearing the prophet's life story i like his transparency i never get tired of hearing him recount the story and he talked about how that when he disobeyed the lord his his wife as a result was dying and she was laying on a deathbed and and the prophet managed to get to her just before she was really gone and he called to hope hope hope and and it sort of brought her back to consciousness and she begin to speak to the prophet about what she was seeing when she was when her soul was moving across the dividing line between mortality and immortality and just play something that you feel to play something that's fitting uh and she says and the prophet says he says you know what i think i think god let her break into paradise just as she was going over yeah and she said you know bill that religion that we've been talking about since we received the holy ghost and i said yes i remember the prophet's distraught he is distraught rather than he is broken man she said don't never cease to preach that she said you say that religion that we've been talking about since we received the holy ghost don't never cease to preach that this is a woman this is a person who is seeing the next world you and i have not seen the next world our soul is connected to it oh you haven't seen it she did her soul was crossing over because it's supernatural vision and when the soul came back and she's telling the prophet she's teaching the prophet now she says she is now seeing the value of this gospel because she has just had a little glimpse of eternity and when a soul is coming back in the body she sees and can tell a prophet this gospel is of such value don't never cease to preach that she said stay with that she said that's the thing that's the thing saying what you want is not the thing this word this message this holy ghost that is the thing amen and the prophet said and i said honey if i would have if i just listened oh he was kicking himself saints because when hope goes she's not coming back [Music] our prophet had to make a mistake recount these things for you to appreciate the necessity and the value of this gospel amen and god allowed him to make a mistake that you might benefit that you that we might tonight he said oh if i would have listened she said yes bill she said now look honey she says i'm going fast in other words i'm i'm about to it's my last words my life's about to leave the body because i'm going far she says but remember remember that wonderful holy spirit that we've received she said it's taking me through that wonderful holy spirit that we have received the seal of gods the mark of gods that is what takes you through the veil that's what takes you into glory that's what connects you with an economy that you will have great need of saints in the times in the days months days weeks and months ahead she said it's taking me through she says promise me this honey that you'll never cease you'll never let up you'll always stand true to that she said it's wonderful in death oh from the words of a dying woman sealed by the spirit of the living god it's wonderful in death the prophet said in response to his wife says i will i'll preach this gospel and he did he preached a gun barrel straight saints faithfully suffered made mistakes to give you this gospel this message that by your reception to this message this word that the world has shunned by your receiving it you can change dimensions how faithful he was how he suffered in order that by your receiving you could be changed a pure straight undefiled word and so many make a mockery of and shannon reject [Music] saints never cease to spend time in the world ministers never cease to preach this gospel the time is short but never cease preach it gun barrels straight clear airs don't mince your words people's souls depend what comes forth from your life what comes forth from your lip saints this wonderful holy spirit that we have received that's the seal of god locks you into his economy a faith economy of a faith civilization and we'll take you to that civilization let's stand well [Music] we enjoyed the word tonight [Music] be very nice to minister to you all this evening thank you for the opportunity trust it's encouraged you only frightened leave happy things purpose in your heart to draw closer to the mind amen what what song is that that's being played there it's like what song is that i am mark that's it i am [Music] his spirit [Music] divine oh glory to god [Music] praise the lord [Music] i [Music] am [Music] [Applause] [Music] give him worship [Music] [Music] [Music] one more time i am [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i think this is a time to where you are just look at yourself in the lights of the word that has gone forth [Music] tonight it's an urgent hour since [Music] you know where you stand in relation to the lord i know where i stand i see my faults i see my humanity but i see a promise too saints think of something that was said and the message of the hour a man had a child that was dying and the cardiogram said the child would die the technology said that the child would diet and never failed before but the prophet had seen that the child would live and the man had such a confidence in the word of the prophet he was so happy his wife was so happy and the nurse and the doctor couldn't understand it we're trying to point him back to how that the the chart the cardiogram had never been wrong it was calibrated it had proven itself time and time again with other cases that proved fatal but that man he put his shoulder on he put his hand on the shoulder of that nurse he says lady you're looking at a cardiogram he says but i am looking at a divine promise hallelujah saints look at the divine promise of the word don't look at your circumstances look the promise of the word confess for words each day let faith build listen to the word sit under the influence of the word let it quicken faith faith to be changed it's just by our heads lord jesus heavenly father lord we cannot thank you enough [Music] lord sometimes when we hear your word we cry the times lord we shout sometimes lord we laugh lord just depending on what we're going through how that you are speaking to us at that time stirs us lord sometimes lord we feel nothing but you are ministering all the same you are still god lord it's not subject to our emotions you are god we thank you lord for grace sovereign choosing lord i ask your blessing upon each one here lord jesus i can do nothing for the lord i'm just a man i'm just flesh as they are fun but you are the most i god i pray lord for each one lord this may be our last time together like this looking that way lord god i pray for each one gathered here for these meetings lord may they go forth father never letting [Music] that lord little something in them get less but lord they would earnestly seek your face then lord you would come down and minister to them only you can do that lord as much as we want it it's

god will guide us home i'm so glad i can stand and say i can't be marked with the mark of the beast you've already been sealed by the seal of god amen the devil came too late hallelujah i trust that's everyone else's testimony and if it's not your testimony just say lord take everything out of my life that's contrary to your word you can dwell in me and he'll do the rearrangement he'll do the removal and then he'll fill you amen we don't want to have one foot in the world of one foot in god's kingdom we just want to be head foot everything we are to god's kingdom amen burn every bridge there's no point going back what's there to go back to destruction and death i just rather go into life amen we're here choose life hallelujah that's what we heard tonight choose life amen hallelujah yeah there's a scripture in revelations that says that god puts it in the mind of man to fulfill his will well i think it's revelation 17 or 18. so i'm just i'm just repeating what brother matthew said because some people think it's too far-fetched that god's actually in control no it's not too far-fetched he's put in the minds of everyone who thinks they're in power to fulfill his word whether they're aware of it or not they're fulfilling his word but we're here to fulfill his word too amen it's not just us being like a puppet master no we've willingly given our lives i mean to serve him in the same time hallelujah amen you're the lord jesus amen he's never had a conscription but he's had the most volunteers in all of history in an army to gather to him i volunteered i signed up over my own free will amen the devil tried to get me to sign up but no i just saw his terms and conditions and i saw the pay i get and his pay is the wage of sin or death so i thought i don't want that payday but then god said i'll give you life eternal and even on this side i'll give you life and life more abundantly so i thought well that's a pretty good deal that's a pretty good salary to draw that's a pretty good life insurance to draw dividends it pays off sister hope said to brother brown what we heard the end it pays off this holy ghost gospel pays off it's not in vain hallelujah i mean the word's going to guide us home hallelujah let the world fall apart it has to fall apart amen we're not we can't fall apart but don't if you're if you're teetering back and forth i pray an angel just pushes you over into into grace into salvation but god doesn't force you the devil's a cruel task master he tricks you into it then he traps you and thinks you can never be free because you knew better he does that doesn't he yes yeah but the devil's a liar you've got a you're a denounced one to accept the other or you denounce the other to accept the one so i denounced satan and i accepted the lord jesus i had to renounce the devil to accept the lord but then other people will denounce the word the lord to accept the devil i don't even want to fall into that category it's not worth it so i'd say in these meetings you know them say by some big prayer but from your heart you say lord i choose life i want your life in me lord i want you to live in me that's what i want i want to be sealed in that i can't be marked with the mark of the beast hallelujah i'm sick when you're glad that day brother phil brother fish you chose life hallelujah brother andy where are you he's probably cooking but he chose life one day hallelujah he was in a prison cell and god found him in a prison cell hallelujah hallelujah amen i pray if you god will find you here amen god bless you brother matthew appreciate it amen god bless you appreciate you thank you [Music] hallelujah hallelujah our god's great he's worth serving amen amen he's worth surfing let's just sing this again shall we amen i'm so glad [Music] hallelujah you know you should ask i won't tell the testimony i'll tell a very condensed form sister christine can tell it to you but her auntie was dying of of of brain cancer over in switzerland and and and she went over there to nurse her as she was dying she didn't know the lord and she was actually on death's door and she was terrified there were dark streaks and things moving through the through the room because she hadn't given her life to lord and and the the doctor said she was gonna die and christine interceded said lord don't let her die she's not ready and she didn't die and then during a process of time the time where the lord gave her grace and she surrendered her life and then she was going to cross over she didn't see dark streaks and demons in the room to torment her she said it's so beautiful can't you see those birds can't see that paradise hallelujah and the lord told christina said actually she's going to die i think in the next week or something and she passed on but if she could if beatrice i don't know what her last name was her her maiden name's ruik but if she could come here right now she would say that decision was worth it all the fair go she wasn't afraid to die after that sister hope if she could stand right here she'd say it was worth it brother brown would you stand here and say it was worth it the apostle paul would stand and say it's worth it all the believers down through the ages those fed to lions sauna sunder whatever that's it was worth it hallelujah it's worth it amen yes sir okay we're gonna pray for brother arimand hallelujah he's a trophy of these camps the stewart family a trophy of these camps hallelujah god's done great things and i believe this campground was built for us i believe it was built for us hallelujah so we're going to pray for him now but if you want to give your life the lord and prayer just say lord take my life take all i am he'll receive you he says all that come to me i'll know why it's cast out irrespective of the baggage we carry he's not worried about the baggage he's interested in you amen says pray shall we gracious heavenly father i feel so moved i'm just so happy lord lord you found me at university lost i so lost lord we allow the message to come my way lord i didn't have a church or anyone but you found me i'm so glad lord i'm so glad you found me lord you chose to find me and lord evan here there's many here that they can go back in their life and they can go back to that time where you found them lord it wasn't us seeking you as you seeking us because you can't lose a child of yours you can't lose a son or a daughter hallelujah lord you said all that the father's given me will come and all that come to me i'll know why it's cast out father i pray for each soul here maybe those who are streaming lord if they haven't made up their mind may they give their lives to you it's worth it lord it's worth it lord if that mighty host of witnesses could just come through the veil and they could speak to us they none of them would say it wasn't worth it that all of them say it's worth it it's greater than we can imagine lord as your prophet went beyond the curtain of time he came back lord he could describe the condition of the people and lord those things but he couldn't describe how sublime it was how great it was lord to be in that great land lord jesus and we believe and we know and soon very soon you're going to take us into that land lord we're looking forward to that time where we step into that land so father i pray lord you'd move on every heart here as it made up their mind may they say i want to go to that land may they give their lives to your mother be sealed in lord sealed into the kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost lord not just religious not trying to be a better person but may they surrender and die out lord mother be birthed into the kingdom by the holy ghost o god lord may conviction fall in every heart i pray and lord we want to lift brother i reminded your presence by prayer father he's labored so much love with the sound and lord different things behind the scenes oh god father i pray you touch his body in the name of jesus christ lord the devil's trying to rob him lord of lord of being here lord i pray that that sickness would leave him now in the name of jesus christ while they'd fully restore his health oh god may you minister him even now where he is oh lord bless him abundantly father lord we thank you for his life we thank you for the steward family lord bless them lord we thank you for their labor of love behind the scenes and their god we just want to commit the service into your hands i'm so glad i can't be marked by the mark of the beast the devil came too late oh hallelujah to your great name lord jesus oh we praise your name father thank you lord i pray to god as we dismiss the service now lord may your presence go with us i pray so go and have supper or we stay here and linger and pray may these things not leave us may there not just be like waters off a duck's back but might anchor down into our souls i'm sealed into the day of my redemption oh god and
