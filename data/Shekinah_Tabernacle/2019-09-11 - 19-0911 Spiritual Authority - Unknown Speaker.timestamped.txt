[0:00] but too late okay beginning a fib it's a
[0:03] nice day and then autumn sitzen yeah but
[0:12] you know am i you're not on rusty
[0:22] how's it okay good
[0:26] there's a song that says I'm living on a
[0:29] mountain underneath a cloudless sky I'm
[0:31] drinking from a fountain that never
[0:33] shall run dry I'm feasting on the manner
[0:36] of a bountiful supply for I'm dwelling
[0:38] in butyl and you know when you when you
[0:41] well in the holiest of Holies it doesn't
[0:45] really matter what the climate that side
[0:48] is doing what the weather is doing
[0:50] anything like that it's irrelevant what
[0:52] the situation is like in your life
[0:53] whether it's good or bad or that it
[0:55] doesn't matter and that's the epitome of
[0:57] the Christian walk is really dwelling in
[0:59] that place because when you boil it all
[1:01] down what does all this really matter
[1:03] whether this or that it's all temporal
[1:06] you know set your eyes on things eternal
[1:08] that the thing the unseen things are the
[1:11] eternal things but these temporal things
[1:14] come and go you know we worry so much
[1:16] about temporal things they will just
[1:18] come and go set your eyes on things
[1:22] eternal I'm just let something stand and
[1:28] see them we'll just pray this evening
[1:30] come with the service to the Lord and
[1:31] then we'll sing a few songs Lord Jesus
[1:36] we just think that we can gather here
[1:38] the Lord in your house again let me just
[1:41] thank you Lord that you've made a way
[1:43] for us to enter into the holiest of
[1:45] Holies Lord
[1:47] Lord where there where there was no way
[1:50] for man Lord we were shut out from your
[1:53] presence Lord by son but we are so
[1:56] grateful that you made that way Lord
[1:58] that we could come back into fellowship
[1:59] with you Lord and may we always take
[2:02] advantage of that Lord to love it dwell
[2:06] in that place Lord we know when we dwell
[2:08] in that the place of the flesh Lord
[2:10] that's where all of our trouble starts
[2:11] Lord because this this flesh has worried
[2:13] and has fear and has anxiety
[2:15] it has all those things Lord but when we
[2:19] dwell in perfect love there's none of
[2:20] that around the Lord and we're just so
[2:22] grateful the weekend being an atmosphere
[2:25] all where where we can be be in that
[2:28] place of love Lord we just pray that
[2:30] your spirit would fill up your heart
[2:31] here the season law Bailey may our minds
[2:34] focus upon you Lord may we see things
[2:37] with spiritual eyes this evening not
[2:38] natural eyes maybe look to the spiritual
[2:41] things Lord we bless brother benasi
[2:43] Merciless bless the songs Lord and just
[2:46] bless us Lord forgive us of all our sins
[2:48] and mistakes thought and help us each
[2:49] day to just walk before you lord as
[2:52] David said thy word have I hid in my
[2:54] heart that I might not sin against thee

[32:33] each one father in Jesus Christ name
[32:35] Amen amen god bless your friends you may
[32:38] have your seats this night so I want to
[32:40] speak about scriptural authority no no
[32:43] I'm not speaking about the authority of
[32:45] Scripture necessarily how we know the
[32:47] word is true you know the Bible is
[32:49] correct we have the right translation
[32:51] but I want to speak about having having
[32:54] scriptural Authority where God comes in
[32:56] and he and he testifies of of the
[33:02] believer now brother brems isn't me in
[33:04] the way of a true prophet 1962 he says
[33:07] as I was saying the other day someone
[33:09] talking about purgatory and give
[33:11] references to many like st. Francis and
[33:14] st. Cecilia and she praying for certain
[33:17] people and out of purgatory and give
[33:20] such authorities as that that's
[33:22] unscriptural authority it's people who
[33:25] does not have an authority the Apostles
[33:28] had the scriptural authority and if it's
[33:30] contrary to them it's a lie as far as
[33:33] I'm concerned so many people they come
[33:36] and authority of a of a nation you know
[33:38] ambassadors will come and they and the
[33:40] authority of that nation as is backing
[33:42] them up and people come in the authority
[33:44] of a church or some great teaching or
[33:45] some Bible School or but the believer
[33:48] doesn't come in those kind of
[33:49] authorities the believer comes and the
[33:52] authority of the word where the word
[33:53] himself is behind the believer now Jesus
[33:56] was asked this question and it's amazing
[33:58] because here we are a young mark you
[34:01] know they were you know they came to him
[34:03] after he had done incredible miracles he
[34:05] had raised the dead he had come the
[34:07] storm he had done many incredible things
[34:09] and they came to him and saying by what
[34:11] authority do you do these things you
[34:13] know they could see that the authority
[34:15] he had wasn't the authority they had it
[34:17] was an otherworldly Authority they
[34:19] couldn't understand it you know but yet
[34:21] before this Nicodemus came to him by
[34:23] night said Jesus master we know that
[34:26] thou art a teacher come from God for no
[34:28] man can do these things unless God be
[34:30] with them so they knew that he was he
[34:32] was more than just in the man with a
[34:34] teaching but this was more than a
[34:36] even a profit I could say but you know
[34:37] this was someone with authority and we
[34:40] know that he had supreme authority he
[34:42] didn't just have a lesser authority but
[34:44] here was the creator himself was made
[34:46] flesh I mean the one who created all
[34:48] things the one who is there to purchase
[34:50] the redemption of his bride was standing
[34:52] upon the earth yeah you know the you
[34:54] know the the promise that had been given
[34:57] in the garden of the scene of the woman
[34:59] was there and he had supreme authority
[35:01] there was no devil that could hold him
[35:03] nothing could withstand him hallelujah I
[35:06] mean he had supreme authority now now
[35:11] Authority just just just the meaning of
[35:13] it if you don't mind me your authority
[35:15] it means the power or right to give
[35:18] orders to make decisions and to enforce
[35:20] obedience and Webster Webster's
[35:23] dictionary would say it's a power to
[35:25] influence or command thought opinion or
[35:28] behavior an authority is also a freedom
[35:30] granted by one in authority hallelujah
[35:34] so you know he had authority and he's
[35:37] given us the same Authority you got to
[35:40] know what's backing you up
[35:41] amen your brother Bram he would say many
[35:43] times about how ministers would come to
[35:45] him out of denominations and they'd say
[35:47] we know what your preaching is the truth
[35:49] but if we begin to preach these things
[35:51] our churches will kick us out our
[35:52] denominations will kick us out so they
[35:54] weren't willing to make the step but he
[35:56] said don't you know Christ as you're
[35:58] backing up I mean you don't need a
[36:00] paycheck you don't need a church to back
[36:02] you up I mean but your authority comes
[36:04] should come from heaven I mean so we
[36:06] have to have I trust we have the UM you
[36:08] know the confidence that Christ is our
[36:11] backing up I mean the word is our
[36:12] backing up I mean if we stand for him
[36:14] he'll stand for you amen so now this
[36:17] word Authority in in the scripture it
[36:21] comes from the Greek word and I probably
[36:23] can't pronounce it even close to or lets
[36:25] me to sound like but it's a excuse eeeh
[36:28] which means a power that means the power
[36:32] of choice that means the power of
[36:34] authority and influence and of a right
[36:36] or a privilege I mean so if you have
[36:39] been given authority if you have
[36:41] scriptural authority then you have a
[36:43] right or privilege given by God to you I
[36:46] mean as as as the Apostle Paul
[36:50] speak about Jesus and the book of
[36:52] Hebrews and he would say you know
[36:54] contrasting the blood of bulls and goats
[36:56] being being not as great as the blood of
[36:58] Jesus Christ he would he would say the
[37:01] blood of Jesus Christ is greater than
[37:02] that of blood of bulls and goats you'd
[37:04] say the priesthood of our Lord Jesus is
[37:06] greater than the high priests you're the
[37:07] natural lineage of of of Levi amen and
[37:11] then he would say for if the blood of
[37:13] bulls and goats and the ashes of a
[37:15] heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies
[37:18] to the purifying of the flesh how much
[37:20] more shall the blood of Christ who
[37:22] through the Eternal Spirit offered
[37:23] himself without spot to God purge your
[37:26] conscience from dead works to serve the
[37:28] Living God
[37:29] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[37:32] the New Testament that by means of death
[37:34] for the redemption of the transgressions
[37:36] that were under the first Testament they
[37:39] which are called might receive the
[37:40] promise of eternal inheritance for where
[37:43] a testament is there must also of
[37:47] necessity be the death of the testator
[37:49] so the testator's the one who gives no
[37:52] no there another word for Testament is a
[37:54] will right so the testator is the one
[37:58] who actually writes down the will and
[37:59] then gives it before he dies for a
[38:01] testament is of force after mina did
[38:07] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[38:10] while the testator liver so he's saying
[38:12] now if the if the man just say for
[38:15] example if I have a will and I'm alive
[38:17] then what's in the will could not be
[38:19] distributed to those who I've named in
[38:21] the will I mean it has no force is no
[38:23] effective and it's just on paper but if
[38:25] I am dead now then someone worth with
[38:27] legal authority has the right to
[38:29] dispense my estate to those who have
[38:31] given it to hallelujah so it's the same
[38:34] thing so there's an authority that's
[38:35] been given I mean like a lawyer has an
[38:38] authority he has a right or she has a
[38:40] right to actually dispense the contents
[38:43] of a will that I would leave so for
[38:44] example if I had a house and I put in my
[38:46] will that the house goes to Annalise
[38:48] within therefore there's now the law is
[38:50] behind that decision that she has to
[38:52] receive the house or if I have a
[38:54] tropical island and it goes to Lilia
[38:56] where has to go to Lilia or Gabriel on
[38:58] my jet plane I don't know but it has to
[39:00] go to them right it has to go to them
[39:02] because there's no
[39:03] Ferdie given to the lawyer to give them
[39:06] the contents of the will that is under
[39:08] their name hallelujah and it's the same
[39:10] thing with us our Lord Jesus now he
[39:12] lifts us with the will I mean he lifts
[39:15] us with with an inheritance right and
[39:18] now there is an authority being given as
[39:20] the Apostle Paul would say a
[39:22] dispensation of the Gospels been
[39:23] committed to me now that dispensation
[39:25] was now he was going to assure the
[39:27] Gentiles this is what's been in the will
[39:29] I mean it was hidden in the mind of God
[39:31] it was hidden in types and shadows in
[39:33] the Old Testament but now I'm gonna I
[39:35] have been given Authority I've been
[39:37] given authority by God because the
[39:39] testator died Jesus Christ died so now
[39:42] the will comes into force I mean but he
[39:44] didn't just die he rose again I mean
[39:47] that his spirit now would distribute
[39:48] that would the contents of the will to
[39:51] the elected ones hallelujah so now here
[39:53] was because God always uses man God God
[39:56] sent the Apostle Paul I mean with a
[39:58] dispensation of of the gospel to to the
[40:01] Gentiles and he would begin to preach
[40:03] and what in what was happening as God
[40:05] was releasing the contents of the will
[40:07] to as the lik people I mean so once once
[40:10] they were dead in trespasses and sins
[40:12] but that was not what was written in the
[40:14] will for them are you following me
[40:15] I mean their inheritance would not be
[40:17] they were dying just and just be
[40:19] destroyed and like a fire but in the end
[40:21] the contents of the will was eternal
[40:23] life for them hallelujah but they had to
[40:26] come to a place where they would hear
[40:28] the word and faith cometh by hearing and
[40:30] hearing the Word of God and they had to
[40:32] hear the word of God they had to work
[40:34] here the contents of the will there was
[40:36] for them hallelujah
[40:38] that's why you come and you hear the
[40:40] message or something and it quickens to
[40:42] your soul like no other word can why
[40:44] because the contents of the will is
[40:47] being distributed to you I mean so part
[40:49] of what's in the inheritance eternal
[40:51] life hallelujah there was one in this
[40:54] day
[40:54] I mean who had Authority Holly he's in
[40:57] Supino he was in Sabino Canyon in there
[41:00] and the sword landed in his hand and
[41:01] then in the brother was wondering what
[41:03] you know he says I was scared of a knife
[41:06] you know cutting people and yo-yo he
[41:09] said he's glad he didn't live back in
[41:10] those days and and and and and the voice
[41:13] said to me angel said it's it's the king
[41:15] sword
[41:17] and he said eyes it like you know dua
[41:18] night people as well no he says but but
[41:21] then the voice said no it's not a king
[41:23] sword it's the Kings sword and the only
[41:25] the King is the word I mean your here's
[41:27] the waiter now and the only sort of the
[41:29] King as the word himself I mean so now
[41:32] the word was placed in the prophets hand
[41:33] I mean so now I'm in the contents of the
[41:36] will that was sealed up and seven seals
[41:38] could be distributed to the
[41:40] predestinated hallelujah are you
[41:43] following me where we have authority
[41:44] remember the Lord has given authority to
[41:47] his bride I mean that she would receive
[41:49] her inheritance in Christ hallelujah
[41:53] because now now after you meet the Lord
[41:55] it's just you're going through a great
[41:56] big arcade of the word saying now what
[41:58] belongs to me
[41:59] I mean I want to see what's in this
[42:01] aisle I want to see what's up on this
[42:02] shelf I mean every I don't just want to
[42:04] walk in the front of the you know you
[42:06] know the front of the wood and say well
[42:07] this is nice I want everything oh and
[42:10] every part of the inheritance is mine by
[42:12] His grace and I want to receive it
[42:16] hallelujah so now otherwise so for a
[42:18] testator as a force a testament as a
[42:21] force after mina did otherwise it is of
[42:24] no strength at all while the testator
[42:27] liveth now moses would take the blood of
[42:29] bulls and goats and after he had
[42:31] received the law on Mount Sinai he wrote
[42:34] hey yo yo so so that was already
[42:36] sprinkled he took that blood and he
[42:38] sprinkled the people and the book with
[42:41] that same blood and he'd say this is the
[42:43] blood of the Testament which God hath
[42:46] enjoined unto you so he said now the
[42:47] blood connected what was in the law to
[42:50] the people amen and we know many know we
[42:53] know that the law was just a policeman
[42:55] that put people in jail amen but if
[42:59] those who actually lived according to
[43:00] the law would receive the promised land
[43:03] there was power in the law to overcome
[43:06] their enemies right it wasn't just to
[43:09] condemn them there was power in that law
[43:11] that they could go and they could take
[43:13] Jericho they could take AI they could
[43:16] conquer all of their inheritance you
[43:18] following me I mean there was power in
[43:20] that law hallelujah so now so now the
[43:24] blood connected them to the law I mean
[43:27] and if they fully serve the Lord God God
[43:30] than through Moses that they fully
[43:32] served him they would possess the land I
[43:35] mean but if they turned and followed
[43:37] idols in then they'd be consumed off the
[43:39] land they had a choice I'd rather just
[43:41] serve the Lord I mean you look at the
[43:43] benefits of serving him I mean so so so
[43:48] he he he sprinkled the book and the
[43:51] people and says this is the blood of the
[43:53] test which God has enjoined unto you so
[43:55] he okay well I'll just read it for it
[43:57] whereupon this is in Hebrews 9 I'm still
[43:59] there 18 whereupon neither the first
[44:01] Testament was dedicated without blood
[44:03] for when Moses had spoken every precept
[44:06] to all the people according to the law
[44:08] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[44:10] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[44:13] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[44:15] people saying this is the blood of the
[44:17] tests in which God hath enjoined unto
[44:19] you so he connected the people in the
[44:21] book together so the contents of the
[44:23] word was was connected by the blood of
[44:26] bulls and goats and those who fully
[44:28] served him possessed what was in the law
[44:30] because remember the purpose of the law
[44:33] coming was that God would dwell among
[44:35] him I mean they would they would live in
[44:37] their inheritance what God predestined
[44:38] for them to receive they would receive
[44:40] it so Manasseh would receive manassas
[44:42] portion Ephraim would receive Ephraim's
[44:44] portion Amen Jojo
[44:46] all the tribes would receive Judah here
[44:49] Benjamin here is the car here you know
[44:51] they would receive their inheritance in
[44:53] the land now that is just under the
[44:55] blood of bulls and goats now so there
[44:57] was an authority given by Moses to
[45:01] connect the people to the book but Moses
[45:04] representing the law could not take the
[45:06] people into the land so now the
[45:09] authority was given to Joshua take the
[45:12] people across Jordan take them take them
[45:15] into their inheritance you know what's
[45:18] the first words that you know you know
[45:20] God would speak to Joshua in the Book of
[45:21] Joshua Moses my servant is dead so we've
[45:25] come from so now God saying I'm turning
[45:27] a corner they've come out of Egypt but
[45:29] this is not the end of the destination
[45:31] now they've got to go in a mincer now
[45:33] brother Brown when he would come and and
[45:36] and the time of the seals was
[45:37] approaching he had a vision of walking
[45:40] he was he said there are two thirds of
[45:42] the way oh you're
[45:44] on their journey towards Jordan hey sure
[45:46] and he said every promise lays over
[45:48] Jordan in the promised land and then so
[45:51] and then and then a hand came down and
[45:53] showed him Joshua one and his commission
[45:55] and he preaches sermon as I was with
[45:57] Moses so I'll be with you so now a time
[46:00] was coming where a church was coming out
[46:01] of the wilderness and was now a time
[46:04] where the bride would go across Jordan
[46:06] and she would possess every promise
[46:08] that's in the land hallelujah I meant
[46:11] there was great victories in the pro you
[46:13] know in the end the wilderness but
[46:14] that's not our final resting place I
[46:16] mean that's just a journey part of the
[46:18] journey but our destination is in the
[46:21] promised land
[46:21] I mean to cross Jordan I mean and gone
[46:24] to the promised land now here we have
[46:26] now I feel like I'm going a bit fast are
[46:30] you following me remember Paul parallels
[46:34] Israel coming out of Egypt and and going
[46:38] into the Promised Land as the journey of
[46:40] the believer you come out of Egypt come
[46:42] out of the world you're justified you're
[46:44] baptized sanctified in the wilderness
[46:46] but then you've got a cross and go into
[46:48] your wrist which is receiving the Holy
[46:50] Ghost I mean so now so now brother
[46:54] Branham would preach a sermon before
[46:55] they're saying about its figure out
[46:56] turning northward and and he would speak
[46:59] about how God would tell Moses you've
[47:02] been going around this mountain in the
[47:03] wilderness long enough
[47:04] they've got turned northward and go over
[47:07] Jordan hallelujah and he said the church
[47:10] has been going round the mountain until
[47:12] the old generation the fighters died off
[47:14] but now here comes another generation
[47:16] raises up that believes the full Word of
[47:18] God they can go on and possess the land
[47:21] hallelujah so now we are living we are
[47:23] we are those people I mean we're not
[47:26] looking for another church age to come
[47:28] we're not looking for other people to
[47:29] come I mean oh it's us that will cross
[47:31] Jordan and I believe most of us have
[47:33] crossed Jordan I mean where were what do
[47:36] you mean by crossing Jordan crossing
[47:38] Jordan as as death to self I mean were
[47:40] you died out to your ambitions your
[47:42] hopes your plans everything you are
[47:44] I mean you fully surrender everything
[47:46] you die to yourself I mean and the word
[47:48] takes you across Jordan and to the
[47:50] promised land hallelujah and brother
[47:53] Bram would also say I mean he'd also say
[47:56] that the promised land is the son of man
[47:58] which is the word so you have to have
[48:01] just like you take you take when Jesus
[48:03] was here the first time those that
[48:06] really had an experience with him
[48:08] they went into Christ they received
[48:11] their inheritance so it wasn't just
[48:13] those that were healed or those that
[48:15] that ate the loaves or maybe saw a
[48:18] miracle it wasn't them it was those that
[48:20] went into the upper room those are the
[48:23] ones that receive their inheritance in
[48:24] Christ when they look you know just like
[48:27] Peter said you know Jesus asked him who
[48:30] do men say that I am he says thou art
[48:32] the Christ the Son of the Living God he
[48:34] said blessed art thou simon barjona for
[48:36] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[48:38] under thee but my father which is in
[48:39] heaven and upon this rock I'll build my
[48:42] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[48:43] prevail against it so he he looked
[48:46] beyond the flesh of a man and he saw God
[48:48] he saw God veiled in a body
[48:50] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[48:52] you and I when you can see this message
[48:54] and hear the voice behind the voice and
[48:57] it were I'm glad I'm not caught up in
[48:59] belt buckles and hunting in and their
[49:01] big gallon hats and you know fishing and
[49:03] everything the Prophet did I'm not
[49:04] caught up in his personality oh no
[49:07] that's not why I listen to I I listen to
[49:09] it because God showed me this is me
[49:10] speaking to this generation I mean
[49:12] you've got to hear the voice behind the
[49:14] voice and when you can recognize that
[49:16] it's a scriptural voice I miss the voice
[49:19] that wrote this scripture has spoken in
[49:22] this generation I mean and what is that
[49:24] now that's the son of man revealing
[49:26] himself to you and now that opens our
[49:28] land you that every promise in Christ is
[49:30] in you I mean that you receive it
[49:32] hallelujah well the man would say you
[49:35] know the true new birth is the
[49:36] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[49:38] you where he becomes real to you he
[49:42] reveals himself and hears the word when
[49:44] he when he becomes real to you that is
[49:47] the new birth hallelujah I mean what's
[49:51] happening why Christ has become alive
[49:53] this is no longer just a book you read
[49:55] because you're raised to read it know it
[49:57] becomes a personal love letter
[49:58] it becomes a personal book hallelujah I
[50:01] mean where where wherever you read it's
[50:03] at speaking to you it's no longer
[50:05] stories it becomes a reality it actually
[50:08] becomes a light to your feet hallelujah
[50:11] a lamp unto
[50:11] path because it becomes a personal
[50:13] relationship with you you and him Amen
[50:18] now brother Brown would say in the
[50:24] Misses presuming and he preaches it a
[50:27] few times but he said that the that the
[50:30] believers in the first church they he
[50:37] said he said the day of Pentecost they
[50:40] waited till they had scriptural
[50:42] authority because now they that they had
[50:45] to have something to stand upon when
[50:47] times got tough it wasn't all we've been
[50:49] with Jesus no they had to have
[50:52] scriptural authority jesus knew who he
[50:54] was
[50:54] this is backtrack he says in John he
[50:57] sees in John 5 he says search the
[50:59] Scriptures for in them you think you
[51:01] have eternal life and they are they
[51:03] which testify of me and really a more
[51:07] correct way of saying that as ye search
[51:08] the Scriptures for in them ye think you
[51:11] have eternal life and they are they
[51:12] which testify of me so he knew that the
[51:15] word spoke of him and that gave him
[51:17] scriptural authority I mean because he
[51:20] knew he was the fulfillment of the
[51:21] scripture I mean he knew he was the
[51:24] fulfillment of the Old Testament here he
[51:26] was so that gave him scriptural
[51:27] authority he didn't come in his own
[51:29] opinion he says the doctrine are
[51:31] teachers not mine it's my father's I
[51:33] mean he says here's another one that
[51:34] bears witness I mean that's my father
[51:36] bears witness of me see he had true
[51:38] scriptural authority hallelujah it's on
[51:42] the day of Pentecost because Jesus says
[51:45] to them in the book of John as my father
[51:48] has sent me so send I you
[51:50] Allu you I mean so now they had to wait
[51:54] until they received scriptural authority
[51:57] he says the day of Pentecost they waited
[51:59] till they had scriptural authority
[52:01] that's right before they claimed
[52:02] anything they know they had it they
[52:05] didn't say well I feel a little
[52:06] sensation they felt it saw it something
[52:09] else they knowed it was there they seen
[52:11] it moving in them working in them
[52:13] talking through them everything it was
[52:15] there they didn't have to presume
[52:17] nothing that was there talking for
[52:20] itself and a man when he is born again
[52:23] of the Spirit of God is the same thing
[52:25] today
[52:25] you don't presume now to presume it
[52:28] means to venture without authority so
[52:31] you're just basically doing a stab in
[52:32] the dark guessing I think I'm there but
[52:35] the believer does not presume I mean the
[52:38] believer doesn't need to presume the
[52:39] believer doesn't need to guess that
[52:41] believer knows they've met him that
[52:43] believer has the experience they know
[52:45] they've met the Lord Jesus Christ so
[52:47] they're not presuming and guessing I
[52:48] think I'm a believer they know they're a
[52:50] believer and because God comes them
[52:52] behind their life and vindicates their
[52:54] life to prove that they have true
[52:56] scriptural authority hallelujah and I'm
[52:59] so glad that you know the bride in these
[53:01] last days remember to have scriptural
[53:03] authority is not to have a good sounding
[53:05] argument I mean it's not to have a bunch
[53:08] of traditions behind you well I go to
[53:10] the oldest church has ever been people
[53:12] look for authority for you know you know
[53:14] generations been in the message or or
[53:16] many years or you know my church has
[53:19] been around forever that doesn't give
[53:21] you scriptural authority
[53:22] I mean it's when God meets you for
[53:24] yourself that gives you scriptural
[53:26] authority that gives you authority to
[53:28] stand upon the word amen and we know
[53:30] also that that if this be so I mean we
[53:34] should have such confidence if God is
[53:36] our backing up as the Apostle Paul would
[53:39] say if God be for us who can be against
[53:41] us nothing can be against us hallelujah
[53:45] now the Apostles had scriptural
[53:48] authority on the day of Pentecost
[53:49] because Jesus told them to tarry injure
[53:53] an in Jerusalem until their endued with
[53:55] power from on high so they didn't wait
[53:58] until why I guess you've been here long
[54:00] enough Andrew should we go out or it's
[54:02] been nine days Peter should we go they
[54:04] said no no no we've got to wait
[54:06] something's got to happen to us it's got
[54:08] to be a reality not just a well if one's
[54:11] happy and here we are for you know do
[54:14] you think it happened no it's got to
[54:15] happen right and then now when when the
[54:19] day of Pentecost was fully come and and
[54:22] that same one that was in Jesus Christ
[54:24] without measure was now in his church
[54:26] the same God he believed was the same
[54:28] God wasn't a different one wasn't a
[54:31] third person it was the person came and
[54:33] dwelt in his church and then so and then
[54:36] and then they were speaking other
[54:37] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[54:38] utterance
[54:39] I mean and and the people are saying
[54:41] these men a drunk of new wine and then
[54:44] Peter stood up said he said he said you
[54:47] men of Judea and all that 12 all that
[54:50] dwell at Jerusalem be this known aren't
[54:52] you and hearken to my words we are not
[54:54] drunken as uses you suppose being about
[54:57] the third hour of the day now he's going
[54:59] to go and show some scriptural authority
[55:00] because he's saying this is that spoken
[55:03] by the Prophet Joel he was showing that
[55:05] what you see in front of you is the
[55:07] fulfillment of prophecy I mean this is
[55:09] prophecy being fulfilled holy are not
[55:12] yesterday but today amen and that gave
[55:15] them scriptural authority this was this
[55:17] is that spoken by the Prophet Joel and
[55:19] it shall come to pass in the last days
[55:21] saith god i will pour out my spirit upon
[55:23] all flesh and your sons and your
[55:25] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[55:27] men shall see visions and your old men
[55:30] shall dream dreams and all my servants
[55:32] and all my handmaids i will pour out in
[55:34] those days of my spirit and they shall
[55:36] prophesy and I'll show wonders in the
[55:38] heavens above and the signs and the
[55:40] earth beneath blood and fire and vapor
[55:41] of smoke the Sun shall be turned into
[55:43] darkness and the moon into blood before
[55:45] the great and audible day of the Lord
[55:47] come and it shall come to pass that
[55:49] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[55:51] Lord shall be saved so they were stirred
[55:55] up because this was prophecy being
[55:57] fulfilled I mean they were living out
[55:59] Joel's prophecy and that's why they
[56:01] could stand on the word saying this is
[56:03] that and and they could look at the
[56:05] scribes and Pharisees and they could say
[56:07] shall we serve you or God should we
[56:08] please Mina please God you tell me they
[56:11] were just real simple about it should we
[56:13] please men or please God answer me that
[56:15] question
[56:16] they didn't lead anything pushed him
[56:18] around because they knew God was there
[56:20] backing up I mean it wasn't because
[56:22] someone talked them into it arose it
[56:24] sounded like a nice idea or mommy or
[56:25] daddy did it no they met God I mean they
[56:28] they worse the scripture fulfill for
[56:31] their day they are part of the prophecy
[56:32] I mean and it's the same thing when the
[56:34] when the Bible speaks about a bride let
[56:37] us be glad and rejoice for the marriage
[56:39] of the lamb has come and his bride has
[56:41] made herself ready and to her it was
[56:43] granted that she be she should be
[56:45] arrayed in yo linen clean and white the
[56:47] righteousness of saints hallelujah we're
[56:50] not looking for that to happen it's
[56:51] happening
[56:52] hallelujah that's happening right now
[56:54] we're in the we're in the midst of it
[56:56] God is calling his bride she's being
[56:59] arrayed and find them and clean and wipe
[57:00] the righteousness of saints hallelujah I
[57:03] mean that's why you know we have to we
[57:09] can we can rest that the scripture is
[57:12] the truth and this message calls us to
[57:14] believe the whole Word of God I mean we
[57:17] don't say well the Apostle Paul that's
[57:18] his opinion there and this is someone's
[57:20] idea here no this is all God's Word it
[57:23] turns our heart because the the Ministry
[57:26] of brother brown Malachi 4 was to turn
[57:28] the hearts of the children back to the
[57:30] father's I mean and they believed the
[57:32] whole Word of God amen they believed the
[57:35] whole Word of God and we're being
[57:36] restored back the original faith of the
[57:38] fathers
[57:39] hallelujah where it's not just all that
[57:40] someone's opinion that's Peters opinion
[57:42] no that's God speaking hallelujah amen
[57:47] so now if we have scripture it's like
[57:50] it's like baptism I heard brother Brown
[57:52] say the other day Jesus never said speak
[57:55] these names over them and immerse them
[57:57] in water in the name of the Father Son
[57:59] Holy Ghost is here baptized in the name
[58:00] I mean the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:03] I mean so if you don't do it the
[58:05] scriptural way you have no scriptural
[58:07] authority I mean that the people will
[58:08] receive the Holy Ghost I mean a true
[58:11] birth but if you come according to God's
[58:12] pattern I mean then you can stand on
[58:14] that scriptural authority say Lord I've
[58:16] come according to your word I mean if
[58:18] you have promised me a certain thing I
[58:20] shall receive it hallelujah I mean it's
[58:22] like it yeah you know the scripture says
[58:24] if you draw nigh to me I'll draw nigh to
[58:26] you and if you draw nigh to him with a
[58:28] pure heart he has to draw nigh to you
[58:30] because his word says he will maybe says
[58:32] repent and be baptized in the name of
[58:34] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[58:35] of sin then you shall receive the gift
[58:37] of the Holy Ghost for the promises to
[58:39] you your children those that are far off
[58:40] even as many as the Lord our God chuckle
[58:43] hallelujah so parents that have the Holy
[58:45] Ghost they mean that means the promises
[58:46] to your children hallelujah I mean so we
[58:50] can stand on that promise because we
[58:52] have scriptural authority
[58:54] I mean if Peter said it's for those that
[58:56] he's calling and he called me and I
[58:57] answered me fill me with the spirit
[58:58] there for us for my children hallelujah
[59:02] we have something to stand on in this
[59:05] hour it's not
[59:06] shifting sands of man's opinion and as
[59:08] US saith the Lord according to the
[59:10] scripture hallelujah that's why we
[59:12] should have such confidence
[59:14] we have scriptural authority hallelujah
[59:17] the Apostles overcame because of
[59:20] scriptural authority in their day the
[59:21] same thing will happen at the end if
[59:23] that was the first Church the last
[59:25] church would go out the same way
[59:27] hallelujah amen Abraham would Abraham
[59:32] would come to a place where there was
[59:34] fighting and his and his nephew lot was
[59:37] taken prisoner but he had Authority God
[59:41] spoke to him it may not have been
[59:43] written down but God spoke to him this
[59:44] is your land this is your inheritance
[59:47] he felt heir to all things and lot was
[59:50] taken prisoner there was war and he
[59:53] would and he would arm his servants he
[59:56] would arm his servants and he would go
[59:58] get back his nephew because he had
[1:00:01] scriptural authority this is from
[1:00:05] possessing all things you say brother
[1:00:07] Bram I need healing remember if you're

[1:00:24] bit everything's yours I mean so I
[1:00:27] wouldn't sit back and just say well
[1:00:29] whatever will be will be no David when
[1:00:32] his child with Bathsheba was dying he
[1:00:35] was on his face seeking God Amen
[1:00:38] interceding for it but then when the
[1:00:40] baby died
[1:00:41] David washed himself went into the house
[1:00:43] of God and worshipped because he need
[1:00:45] God was in control of all things but he
[1:00:47] didn't just sit back in some fatalistic
[1:00:49] opinion saying well whatever will be
[1:00:51] will be if it's predestinated it'll be
[1:00:53] produced so no he Preston he sought the
[1:00:55] father's face he saw the Lord's face

[1:04:53] that matters take 120 in the upper room
[1:04:55] there was a woman at the well was there
[1:04:57] Peter tried to kill a God the sword
[1:04:59] there's Mary Magdalene Seven Devils were
[1:05:01] cast out of here all kinds of people
[1:05:03] were there and didn't matter where
[1:05:04] they're from but they stood on God's
[1:05:06] promise when Jesus said tarry in
[1:05:08] Jerusalem they said yes Lord
[1:05:10] until you are endued with power from on
[1:05:12] high yes Lord
[1:05:13] Halle and they receive the promise
[1:05:16] hallelujah he says these signs shall
[1:05:19] follow them that believe yes Lord I have
[1:05:21] scriptural authority I mean to stand
[1:05:23] upon that take God at His Word
[1:05:26] hallelujah what are you gonna do about
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:29] amen hallelujah now brother I'm seizing
[1:05:37] God of this evil age he's speaking about
[1:05:39] natural life that he goes into spiritual
[1:05:41] life he says for as the germ of natural
[1:05:43] life has brought down Dermott eyes from
[1:05:46] father to father
[1:05:47] - father - father souls the life of
[1:05:49] Christ German ties that's the reason God
[1:05:52] uses Elijah's spirit five different
[1:05:53] times what is it it's the handing down
[1:05:57] just as your natural life and traits is
[1:06:00] handed down from the natural breeding of
[1:06:01] your father
[1:06:02] so as the Spirit of God that was pre
[1:06:04] dear said before the foundation of the
[1:06:06] world what sit down passed down from
[1:06:07] generation to generation
[1:06:09] hallelujah so the same victory that it
[1:06:12] won in the first generation will be in
[1:06:13] the next hallelujah if the first
[1:06:16] generation overcame the second
[1:06:17] generation will overcome at their same
[1:06:19] spirit sin and they'll have to overcome
[1:06:21] because the same God hallelujah that's
[1:06:24] why he looked through the scripture what
[1:06:25] is it it's a record of God having
[1:06:27] victory I mean - think they'll swore in
[1:06:30] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[1:06:31] against the dragon his angels that
[1:06:33] dragon prevailed not was cast down to
[1:06:35] the earth so they were fighting in him
[1:06:37] and now he has cast down who chases them
[1:06:39] down to the earth God comes down holy
[1:06:42] and God comes down after his enemy
[1:06:43] hallelujah and then finally there's
[1:06:45] finally there's Moses he walks into
[1:06:48] Egypt and the devil recognizes he looks
[1:06:52] at Moses I say I've seen those eyes
[1:06:53] before I've seen you before somewhere
[1:06:56] that's why I tried to kill all the baby
[1:06:58] boys here and you know you know before
[1:06:59] Moses was born he's trying to wipe out
[1:07:01] that deliverer hallelujah so he looks
[1:07:04] him in the face I've seen this one
[1:07:05] before
[1:07:06] hallelujah the emojis has taken off the
[1:07:09] scene he was a he was a serpent bruiser
[1:07:11] demon defeated he was a liberator
[1:07:13] hallelujah God God showed his power
[1:07:15] there and Moses

[1:07:18] Pharaoh no you're gonna leave some
[1:07:20] behind no we're not gonna leave some
[1:07:22] behind and I'm gonna plant your kingdom
[1:07:24] until you say let them go how many
[1:07:26] plague the kingdom and play the kingdom
[1:07:28] he wasn't sidling for anything less
[1:07:29] hallelujah and they walked out of Egypt
[1:07:32] with all of their ones hallelujah and
[1:07:34] then Moses has taken off the scene he
[1:07:37] comes Joshua as I was with as it was was
[1:07:40] Moses I'll be with you and then the
[1:07:43] devil looks at Joshua I've seen that
[1:07:46] look before
[1:07:47] what's God veiled God manifesting
[1:07:50] himself down through the Old Testament
[1:07:51] he's got trouble
[1:07:53] hallelujah and then and then finally
[1:07:56] then finally it goes down through and he
[1:07:58] makes them all fall in some way because
[1:07:59] their fallen men
[1:08:01] then finally God becomes flesh God's
[1:08:03] encountered in a man and Satan looks at
[1:08:06] him I've seen this one before
[1:08:09] I've seen this one before then finally

[1:13:37] a hundred years before Luther had a
[1:13:39] burden the Bibles could be in their own
[1:13:41] language he believed virtually the same
[1:13:42] thing Luther would one hundred years
[1:13:44] later and before and he stood he came to
[1:13:46] a place where he was alone to be burnt
[1:13:49] at the stake all of his friends for
[1:13:50] sukham but he met someone he met the
[1:13:55] master in his day he couldn't recant
[1:13:57] how can you recant once you've met him
[1:13:59] it's impossible hallelujah and then so
[1:14:02] but he said in a hundred years
[1:14:04] a man will stand up with these same
[1:14:05] things you won't be able to destroy him

[1:15:59] delivered cross our children their eyes
[1:16:01] were fixed cancers were work were
[1:16:04] destroyed people who were dead there was
[1:16:05] one woman had he wore dropper than her
[1:16:07] neighbors cheers been carried up in a
[1:16:09] prayer lighter thing in Phoenix in the

[1:16:33] true that happened hallelujah meeting
[1:16:36] after meeting the devil's defeated and
[1:16:38] the devil's defeated and the devil's
[1:16:39] defeated because he looks in those eyes
[1:16:41] and said I've seen that look before
[1:16:42] I thought I got rid of that look but
[1:16:44] it's still there
[1:16:46] hallelujah but then now but then now the
[1:16:48] prophets taken off the scene because God
[1:16:51] just doesn't want to show what one man
[1:16:52] ministry that's not the end of the
[1:16:54] scripture
[1:16:55] that's now thou must prophesy again
[1:16:57] where a bride will take the book take
[1:17:00] the Testament become one with it and
[1:17:03] then manifest its speak it forth

[1:17:06] so now it's not just one it's an a mini
[1:17:08] membered body around the world so the
[1:17:11] devil goes to every country under heaven
[1:17:13] I believe they're everywhere these
[1:17:15] people almost over whose hearts are all
[1:17:16] aflame and he looks them in the eye mmm
[1:17:22] I've seen this before
[1:17:24] I can't burn it out of them I can't boil
[1:17:26] it out of them I can't I can't bribe it
[1:17:29] out of them hallelujah and it's a
[1:17:31] torment that's a torment because he
[1:17:36] wants control you're like a bully a
[1:17:38] bully
[1:17:39] is not happy if there's someone
[1:17:40] resisting him or her they want to just
[1:17:43] break everyone and just have them as
[1:17:45] little puppets dancing around them
[1:17:46] that's what the devil does that's what
[1:17:49] he wants to do but these are people in
[1:17:50] art and I believe I'm looking at them
[1:17:52] where they don't put up with the bully
[1:17:55] because they know in whom they have
[1:17:57] believed hallelujah it's not thee you
[1:18:00] know it's not it's not us
[1:18:01] you're like brother and seasoned about a
[1:18:02] policeman a policeman doesn't have power
[1:18:05] but he's got authority amen and and
[1:18:09] Jesus said wait tarry in Jerusalem until
[1:18:11] you are endued with them with powerful
[1:18:14] my prompt from on high so the power they
[1:18:17] received wasn't their own power but they
[1:18:18] had the authority to get it but they are
[1:18:20] endued with it and that would and jus
[1:18:22] means to be like put on a dress put on a
[1:18:24] garment you'll be clothed and this power
[1:18:26] just like a policeman he he looks like
[1:18:29] anyone else he puts on a uniform he's in
[1:18:31] dude with power not his power sipar of
[1:18:34] the state parlor and he's got a badge
[1:18:37] and he can be the smallest little fellow
[1:18:39] but everything must if he goes out on
[1:18:41] the street everything's got to stop
[1:18:43] because of the badge that he has he's
[1:18:46] got authority to use the power of the
[1:18:48] state Allu you know that's just a
[1:18:52] policeman how much more believer I mean
[1:18:56] you can have a policeman he's got a
[1:18:57] pulled leg he's not feeling too good but
[1:18:59] he's a policeman he can be this big
[1:19:01] after this many donuts he's still a
[1:19:02] policeman a mint cook he's got authority
[1:19:06] and if he's a real police
[1:19:09] he's not afraid to use that authority
[1:19:11] hallelujah and it's got to be the same
[1:19:13] thing with you and I we can't be afraid
[1:19:16] to use our god-given Authority because

[1:19:21] authority over sickness we have
[1:19:23] authority over every spirit that can be
[1:19:25] named hallelujah

[1:19:28] the testimonies recorded to show
[1:19:30] everything that can be named must bow to
[1:19:33] the name of Jesus Christ and it does
[1:19:35] doesn't matter what kind of sickness
[1:19:37] doesn't water doesn't matter what kind
[1:19:39] of label that man puts on it's a medical
[1:19:41] term at Muspel it must bow to the name
[1:19:44] of Jesus Christ it has to cause that

[1:20:39] an unseen Authority where he had a right
[1:20:43] to go into a throne room of a man who
[1:20:45] thought he was a god and he could say
[1:20:47] let my people go I'm not here to
[1:20:51] negotiate I'm not here do whatever you

[1:22:53] produced the fall to give us a fall of
[1:22:55] nature that we have to dance to his tune
[1:22:56] but that's not the end of the story so
[1:22:59] he cursed humanity thinking we're under
[1:23:01] his puppet strings but then God takes
[1:23:04] the same humanity doesn't change the
[1:23:06] bodies they're born but redeems their
[1:23:08] souls give them a new spirit he comes
[1:23:10] and dwells in them I mean and in the
[1:23:12] same lips that we use for cursing now

[1:25:15] had something in his mind he wanted to
[1:25:16] achieve and God is in control of
[1:25:19] everything so it doesn't matter what we
[1:25:20] think about him he's at all in God's
[1:25:22] hand like anyone else the book of
[1:25:24] Revelation says that God puts it in the
[1:25:26] heart of them to fulfill his word and
[1:25:28] they may not be aware of it God is in
[1:25:30] control of all things nothing's out of
[1:25:32] cater right but what is the good of him
