[18:08] [Music]
[18:13] it's great to be home great to see
[18:16] everyone here this weekend weekend super
[18:24] amen this Friday night everyone is
[18:42] Vandal we're going to go clean the place
[18:43] so it's already after dinner sometime
[18:47] say see you at 6:30 7 o'clock we will go
[18:50] clean you know anyone available they'll
[18:51] be wonderful and we need folding tables
[18:53] gonna hit the folding table but lots of
[18:55] chairs willing to fold tables and I
[19:05] would like to thank all the youth for
[19:07] the Youth Service amen Joshua did
[19:19] outstanding job that was excellent I
[19:20] couldn't be here for I already wanted to
[19:22] but next time I want to say really the
[19:26] youth service really was a was a
[19:29] testament of brother Isaac and sister
[19:32] Shannon's laid with
[19:36] [Applause]
[19:51] in this atmosphere shall we
[20:17] [Music]
[21:11] [Music]
[21:27] amen
[21:29] god bless you I'm very nervous
[21:36] I'm very nervous because I don't do this
[21:39] thing of standing before the people of
[21:42] God every day amen
[21:45] so I give you all in the name of our
[21:48] Lord Jesus Christ I believe that you're
[21:50] all happy tonight and if you are not
[21:54] happy I want to ask you to be happy got
[21:59] no reason not to be happy amen amen
[22:02] so um I just want to put this property
[22:08] so that I must not take too much time
[22:11] and I know it's a midweek service and
[22:16] will come with great expectations and
[22:18] you know one was supposed to come and
[22:21] stand in the front here you wish only
[22:22] few people can come so as I see many
[22:25] people come in I said ma I get to change
[22:29] his brother Ben so but I think I believe
[22:34] that to come to the house of God is not
[22:37] to come to listen to a person if you go
[22:40] come from home you afraid up you speak
[22:43] to your God to come and stick to you
[22:45] because our God is able even to raise a
[22:49] stone to come and preach because he said
[22:54] he will build his own church
[22:55] he didn't say me and random poll me and
[22:59] brother Isaac will build my church is
[23:01] that I your hope I will build my church
[23:04] so all we need to do is ours to be
[23:07] available let's just read from the book
[23:10] of Ephesians chapter 6
[23:12] a few years after 6:00 then maybe like I
[23:21] always like to do at home maybe someone
[23:24] can also open for us as Peter someone
[23:31] can also open as first Peter and we will
[23:35] also read amen
[23:38] first Peter chapter 5 that won't read it
[23:42] from this eighth buttless we are
[23:44] starting with Ephesians 6 from the stem
[23:46] 2 to 18
[23:47] amen amen destined Ephesians chapter 5
[23:55] October 6 I'm with my friend my good
[24:00] friend baby even the Bible says from
[24:04] this on this six they say that
[24:10] understand sorry finally my brethren be
[24:15] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[24:18] his might put on the whole armour of God
[24:23] that ye may be able to stand against the
[24:26] wiles of the devil for we wrestle not
[24:30] against flesh and blood but against
[24:34] principalities against powers against
[24:37] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[24:39] against spiritual wickedness in high
[24:42] places and I think this is where where
[24:45] our little same one is going to be based
[24:46] on verse 12 but let's proceed just just
[24:49] underline hold that the vessel 12
[24:52] misstating wherefore take unto you the
[24:55] whole armour of God a postal police
[24:58] repeating that wait Amma which is that
[25:01] invested and is repeating it is
[25:03] wherefore take unto you the whole nut
[25:06] part of the ummah and not a piece of the
[25:09] AMA the whole armour of God that he may
[25:13] be able to withstand the evil day and
[25:16] having done all to stand stand therefore
[25:20] having your loins get about with truth
[25:25] and having on the breastplate of
[25:27] righteousness and your feet shod with
[25:31] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[25:34] above all taking the shield of faith
[25:38] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[25:41] the fairies fairy dust of the wicked
[25:44] verse 17 and take the helmet of
[25:47] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[25:50] hmm and the sword of death spirit which
[25:54] is the word of God amen
[25:58] I like that I like that verse it
[26:00] specifies which is the Word of God
[26:03] last verse praying always praying always
[26:07] with all prayer and supplication in the
[26:11] spirit and watching thereunto with all
[26:15] perseverance and supplication for All
[26:18] Saints let us pray
[26:20] gracious eternal Heavenly Father lord I
[26:24] can't speak to these people Lord and you
[26:27] know further that I'm not a speaker I
[26:29] pray Lord that as the thought that you
[26:32] put in my mind Lord that you can just
[26:34] inspire it Lord and anointed father and
[26:37] just just remove my mind and my thoughts
[26:40] because I'm not able Lord Jesus I pray
[26:44] that you just give each and every one
[26:46] your portion because your children have
[26:48] left their homes father and they have
[26:50] come here and lord I cannot listen to me
[26:56] Father
[26:56] but they can only listen to you Lord
[26:59] Jesus just help me Lord God and just
[27:01] guide you commit the service into your
[27:04] hands tonight father in the name of our
[27:06] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[27:10] you may be seated I mean so what I want
[27:16] to talk about is it's pretty much what
[27:19] he has been I don't know why the
[27:21] brothers from brother nd that
[27:24] understanding all of standing in the
[27:28] morning right he preached about
[27:32] possessing who remembers our brother in
[27:35] depreciable
[27:36] possessing the Eternal Word
[27:38] not proton in the brother nd the other
[27:41] Sunday when he came from Vietnam didn't
[27:45] he bridge oh you can see forget he
[27:49] pleased about possessing the eternal he
[27:52] pleased about possessing who she was
[27:55] more about what I want to talk about but
[27:57] tonight we want to speak about the
[27:58] message that the Prophet spoke about in
[28:01] 1963 I'm not mistaken the greatest
[28:04] battle ever fought he preached it in 62
[28:06] March 11 Amen we won't finish that
[28:09] message but it's a wonderful it's always
[28:11] so nice when you read the Word of God
[28:12] don't rush it you just you know it's
[28:15] like when you've got nice dessert in the
[28:19] fridge you just take a little bit and
[28:21] just enjoy this little boy of mine likes
[28:25] to to just when you give you something
[28:27] nice adjust it can take the whole hour
[28:30] so that's what we need to do with the
[28:32] Word of God let it sink in let me teach
[28:34] us let it grow as then tomorrow you'll
[28:36] come and you just dine in the presence
[28:38] of God so that's what you'll do tonight
[28:39] wherever the Lord will lead us then
[28:42] we'll go there and then there's already
[28:44] six minutes so now now now what I want
[28:49] to talk about is that the greatest
[28:51] battle ever fought the Prophet teaches
[28:53] us that I forgot that we read but we'll
[28:55] read it as we go along
[28:56] first Peter already but I forget because
[29:00] I don't always tend to just remind me
[29:01] ABA Abraham poor first Peter chapter 5
[29:05] now what what is a battle may be must
[29:10] start by asking yourself that question
[29:11] what is a better you know a battle is
[29:15] something that results from a conflict
[29:18] if they see a conflict whether between
[29:21] the nations the kingdom the governments
[29:23] or a battle is not between two people
[29:26] that is a fight or a war a fight but the
[29:30] battle is you know it can have wars
[29:32] inside now a battle is it can come from
[29:36] two sides they can be many particulars
[29:39] in their battle there can be many
[29:41] participants in a bedroom but the fact
[29:43] of the matter is in your battle usually
[29:46] there's always two sides there's always
[29:49] two sides in your battle you won't find
[29:52] you can find many participants you know
[29:54] you know like we know the nations will
[29:56] have their own allies and they'll have
[29:58] that one supporting them but ultimately
[30:00] there's two sides that is the battle
[30:04] that we are talking about tonight this
[30:06] battle the Prophet says he started in
[30:07] heaven it's not that in heaven and
[30:10] Lucifer lost that battle and then he was
[30:14] kicked down ta right I'm excited for
[30:19] that now now now I don't know I don't
[30:22] know what I must say the unfortunate
[30:24] part of it but in every battle the
[30:29] Prophet says there must be a
[30:31] battleground there must be a place you
[30:33] know according to the rules of war those
[30:36] that understand or battles that there
[30:38] must be an agreement in the orange eyes
[30:41] in the olden days that the Israelites
[30:43] and the Philistines just together you
[30:45] know Galia skies got there by that hill
[30:47] there and the Israelites decide that
[30:49] they said David Matt go Leah under very
[30:51] the Prophet says and then and then they
[30:53] must be like no man's land or a place
[30:56] which we agree that we are going to meet
[30:58] there the result one is the war of Iraq
[31:00] they have fought it in the hindered in
[31:02] the desert huh so now this one that we
[31:06] are talking about there was an agreement
[31:07] also that the battle is going to take
[31:11] place in the human mind huh that's
[31:15] interesting yeah is it not so good
[31:18] sister Melissa I don't know but this is
[31:20] the situation the agreement was that
[31:22] sorry I'd like to participate you know I
[31:25] like to sorry if I Kalyani alright I
[31:28] like to make sure that people follow me
[31:31] as we talk so that way it was agreed
[31:35] that is going to be in the human man I
[31:37] don't want to say here because many
[31:40] times we would want to think that when
[31:44] we talk of the mind is only the head
[31:46] isn't it the Bible says out of their
[31:49] heart the mouth speaketh so which means
[31:52] the hottest for some element of
[31:53] processing certain things in a human
[31:56] body so we know we must just not jump
[32:00] ahead of myself now now the human mind
[32:04] was was agreed that is
[32:05] going to be the battleground now what do
[32:08] you need now for the better
[32:09] what what what do you need for you to
[32:11] engage in a successful battle brother
[32:13] mount was trained I believe in the army
[32:16] you know in South Africa in the olden
[32:18] days it used to be compulsory when you
[32:20] reach a certain age you go to the army
[32:21] one year to be disciplined to be trained
[32:24] to understand and to know that we are
[32:25] not here to play right now in the Army
[32:29] you know a tactful sight will know that
[32:31] for for a battle to be successful
[32:34] there's certain things that you require
[32:35] right you require soldiers number one
[32:38] right you require ammunition you require
[32:41] them to be trained huh
[32:43] you require the captain you don't want
[32:45] the leader you need someone who will
[32:47] lead you the captain if you don't have
[32:49] the captain you become like what you
[32:52] wanted a strategy or never if you want
[32:55] you're under the direction all right so
[32:57] you need the captain but and you need
[32:59] strategy you need the tactics of all
[33:01] that is I'm telling you about the basic
[33:04] things of a natural war and I'd like you
[33:07] to think about the fist the spiritual
[33:09] war as we'll go into that now you need
[33:12] the soldiers and you need you know and
[33:15] nowadays they color they talk about air
[33:17] force you know ground force you know a
[33:20] navy there's all sorts of things right
[33:22] but in the world that we are talking
[33:24] about the role of the Lord the Lord has
[33:28] got his own ingredients he's got his own
[33:30] things that you knew me and you must
[33:32] have in order to fight this war because
[33:34] the Prophet says that war after it was
[33:37] brought here huh down here to earth and
[33:40] it was going to be fought and he
[33:42] staggered he started already the Prophet
[33:44] says we are in the middle of that war is
[33:46] fighting as we speak and I'll tell you
[33:49] what that fight or that war or that
[33:51] battle
[33:53] who is raging it we are on the last lap
[33:56] we are on the last lap so you can
[33:58] imagine for those who did Atlantic's you
[34:01] know that when we we run around then and
[34:04] then there's a baton that you must give
[34:05] me if I'm on your side that gives us
[34:07] that case that gives stop Bronwyn
[34:09] brother brother mutely then the last one
[34:12] is brother Isaac the last one who's on
[34:14] the last left who's going to win
[34:16] normally the coach will put the first
[34:19] person that's not the one who starts
[34:21] might be the first person you know that
[34:24] pulse that I've laid a foundation God
[34:28] needed to prepare a special vessel for
[34:31] for that first lip to land because that
[34:35] first lip and the last lip he'll squat
[34:37] has got a great impact of the outcome or
[34:39] the results am i right
[34:41] Donna the last leg is very important we
[34:44] are in the last lab today me and you you
[34:47] can imagine how how fury this battle is
[34:50] you can imagine that this that is not
[34:52] gonna be an easy one now in the soldiers
[34:55] must be properly trained and those
[34:59] soldiers the captain has got confidence
[35:00] in the soldiers the Lord is given enough
[35:04] ammunition enough training enough
[35:06] captain everything in this day for us to
[35:09] be able to to run the last leper amen
[35:12] Sona you also need experience what do
[35:20] you call them in the in the military
[35:21] brotherman and these groups of soldiers
[35:24] you know they say the the regiment's you
[35:28] know there's different regiments and
[35:30] some special forces there's some distant
[35:32] that and you don't just want the FS in
[35:34] elementary guys and you put them in the
[35:38] forefront you put each one you know you
[35:41] need experience right in this journey
[35:43] what do you need yeah Joshua what do you
[35:47] need you need experience in this battle
[35:49] right can you hear me Jonah you need
[35:51] experience in this battle you need to
[35:54] have experience if you are a soldier you
[35:57] are going to get experience now we are
[35:59] the soldiers we get experience in this
[36:01] battle and we fight it and we get
[36:03] experience based on what we do in the
[36:07] war or in the battle Emma right now if
[36:11] we procedure there I want to approach it
[36:15] like this that the enemy that we are
[36:17] fighting it's like this you also you
[36:19] need to be able to understand the type
[36:21] of the enemy that you are fighting
[36:23] because if you don't understand the
[36:24] enemy the enemy is like this each and
[36:30] every one of us
[36:32] the enemy has got some photo you know a
[36:35] database you know the enemy our squad
[36:38] has got a desk board like your screen
[36:40] it's got been here for yeah good good
[36:44] Joshua Jaden everyone you squat you
[36:46] database for each one and every one of
[36:48] us and he knows that kou been what aku
[36:53] been his weaknesses what lq been
[36:55] strengths he's not going to waste time
[36:57] and up an approach where the cuban on
[36:59] the side where he's strong he
[37:05] understands that as for Ben even when I
[37:08] go before the Lord to accuse him I must
[37:10] be careful on this site and I talked
[37:13] about this before the Lord you know and
[37:15] say no but law and it was all IQs I goes
[37:18] before God now he knows us and he
[37:21] understand where we are weak where we
[37:24] are strong now we better also do that
[37:27] even more than him we need to know our
[37:29] enemy and understand that hey the Bible
[37:33] says we are fighting against
[37:34] principalities powers on you know in
[37:37] high places
[37:38] now if you're fighting those kind of
[37:40] things you need to be able to know that
[37:43] that one is not my brother that's the
[37:46] enemy this one and how I want to
[37:48] approach it then you need to be able to
[37:50] know that this devil he can make you
[37:53] fight with your brother
[37:54] you can't let you look at this I can say
[37:56] ah this is the devil you you need to be
[37:59] able to know that the devil how does he
[38:02] fight for you and that would take the
[38:05] experience and experience cannot just
[38:08] come you need to hear the way but then
[38:11] believe it right faith comes by hearing
[38:14] here you want the way so it can't just
[38:17] come it's like it's a sequence if
[38:20] everything joins each other now you hear
[38:22] the word it grows up your faith you
[38:24] become strong then then you get
[38:26] experience then you get tested then you
[38:28] know that not the nature of the battle
[38:30] that we are fighting am i right now the
[38:34] purpose of the of the war is to win but
[38:37] through the prophecies but the devil the
[38:39] purpose is his engagement in door is to
[38:43] destroy he wants to destroy
[38:45] he's not a good fighter in fact
[38:47] according to him if I can just add
[38:50] according to the devil I'm sure he he
[38:53] shouldn't have even agreed with God
[38:54] we're to fight the bedroom
[38:55] according dream we were supposed ambush
[38:57] us you know what is to ambush to ambush
[39:00] I don't I don't tell you citizen tell
[39:02] that I'm coming you know you just just
[39:05] cut then you are surprised what what is
[39:08] happening why does this surprise is
[39:10] finished kill you finish is done that's
[39:13] the kind of an enemy that we are
[39:14] fighting he's a bad enemy so according
[39:18] to him yuria blab just to come in and
[39:21] push you and finish you while you are
[39:23] still you know because he wants to
[39:24] destroy you know he comes to steal and
[39:27] to kill one scripture says Amen turn out
[39:31] we win but God wants to win this battle
[39:35] in order for God to demonstrate who he
[39:37] is he the devil is not even of the
[39:40] revelation that God made you for the
[39:42] people's huh to demonstrate how great
[39:45] and mighty is so he thinks he's caught
[39:48] you call with God and he can fight God
[39:50] and he can prove God but God God Jason
[39:52] oh poor thing you know Turner so now we
[39:59] need to be able to see that now the
[40:01] Prophet says here that the reason why it
[40:06] was decided that the battle must be
[40:09] fought in the human mind is because the
[40:12] human mind makes decisions the human
[40:15] mind that's where decisions takes place
[40:17] that is why he made us free moral agency
[40:20] even though God knows that you are my
[40:22] son I protest in 88u I chose you but God
[40:25] because he's the same yesterday today
[40:26] and forever he he
[40:28] God always repeat himself he doesn't
[40:30] change in the future and say no no I did
[40:33] this today know what he did yesterday if
[40:35] he fought the battle in heaven and
[40:37] yannick you do it today yes so now he
[40:40] fought the battle and he won it and
[40:42] today you repeat it because he's the
[40:45] same yesterday today l
[40:46] forever I'm not gonna finish no no no no
[40:50] no no no the Prophet talks about those
[40:51] three circles you know them children the
[40:53] three circles the three rings the inner
[40:56] one where we find faith
[40:58] doubt and you've gotta spill it and then
[41:01] we've got the outer side right he says
[41:04] now the battle that's not stacked on the
[41:07] outside the petal does not start here
[41:09] with our outside five senses not even
[41:12] the inner senses of conscience your
[41:14] equations your your reasoning your you
[41:18] know I call them comic because it's your
[41:21] clenches is your affections is your
[41:23] reasoning imagination and memory am i
[41:26] right so now it does not even fight you
[41:28] you cannot fight the devil and win him
[41:31] day in as much as those things are
[41:33] important but you don't use them to
[41:35] approach or to fight this enemy before
[41:38] you start from the inside he says is the
[41:40] battle start from the inside out which
[41:44] means that there's some process of the
[41:46] mind process that takes place there
[41:48] inside there because he says here that
[41:52] let this mind be in you which was in
[41:54] Christ Jesus
[41:55] that's Philippians chapter 2 that means
[41:57] that there's a process in the inside day
[41:59] where there's either faith or doubt now
[42:02] from there that's where the battle
[42:04] starts when you when you believe God is
[42:06] fast if you doubt God is that then it
[42:08] goes outside you're either for God or
[42:10] against him you're either for the devil
[42:12] or against you've got no other choice no
[42:14] other two two two three three ways right
[42:17] then it starts from there it goes
[42:18] outside then only then then then your
[42:22] your your next second your next three
[42:24] questions your memory then they start to
[42:27] follow suit of what is happening inside
[42:29] there am i right then the outside also
[42:32] that is my Paul could be bitten by a
[42:34] snake there that night how you just
[42:36] shake it in the fire because the spirit
[42:42] was everywhere in his body he couldn't
[42:44] we must have the Spirit of God on every
[42:46] fiber of our body nothing everything you
[42:50] know even your eyes my annuity payment
[42:55] so so that's how we need to be amen I
[42:58] have to stop brother Ben because then we
[43:01] can one day we can we can finish up this
[43:04] message you see like I said at the
[43:06] beginning is a big one and it's a nice
[43:07] one now
[43:09] now now it has to start inside and then
[43:12] a certain certain tag yes the principal
[43:14] part he Tigers the the part that he
[43:17] knows that is important there inside
[43:19] that's where he goes it's Thursday and
[43:21] if we can just make you doubt God from
[43:23] there then he knows that the rest of the
[43:26] other little rings will follow suit ah
[43:28] and God also tackiest the big part the
[43:32] important part the inside where he puts
[43:35] faith and he knows that from there it
[43:37] will pop someone who's saying him
[43:39] personally grandma told me that he pops
[43:40] like like it like I said what like a
[43:43] popcorn you know it pops it pops from
[43:45] the inside they heat stuff from the
[43:47] inside popcorn popcorn doesn't pop from
[43:54] outside Khan come inside no no from
[43:56] inside out right so that's that's how it
[44:00] pops now they just your thoughts that do
[44:03] not your thoughts alone cannot you know
[44:07] God has to open the channel of your
[44:09] thoughts the way that your thoughts are
[44:11] my brother Cuban always pray when it
[44:12] says God just bring us through the
[44:14] channel you know an octave of the
[44:16] channel where God must bring you so that
[44:19] it can it carry can pierce through you
[44:21] know through to your heart so that every
[44:23] channel can be cleared there's nothing
[44:25] that so disgust me like something that
[44:28] is brought you know you know you know my
[44:30] will tell you I always don't like block
[44:32] drainages I don't like them back home we
[44:35] live in a plot I get annoyed because God
[44:44] open that channel of your thoughts and
[44:46] he he he goes deep inside was once
[44:49] there's that communication through the
[44:51] channels of your thought then everything
[44:54] now flows God does that clear
[44:56] communication right through your body
[44:57] amen we need I need to stop him that now
[45:01] we can some other time finish off or
[45:04] pray about it or just go hit it isn't it
[45:08] if you read that message not it it not
[45:11] in your eyes then you just read it and
[45:13] just post and make notes you'll find
[45:16] that is such an anointing it's such a
[45:18] powerful message because it teaches you
[45:21] how to fight this enemy
[45:23] many times we fight the enemy and we are
[45:26] not aware of the enemy when he comes
[45:29] because he uses their mind you know he's
[45:31] able I can sit right here brother Isaac
[45:34] and he can come into my mind and tell me
[45:38] about Isaac you know when I'm thinking
[45:41] about Isaac negatively then he just put
[45:44] me on a pause he goes to Isaac the same
[45:46] demo then he met Isaac to to look at me
[45:50] I got a conflicting ideas and we need to
[45:54] know those things that the devil can
[45:56] compete in a mother and a father and
[45:59] make them fight on something but he is
[46:01] concocting huh he just continued and
[46:04] callek at home a sister he's a scar
[46:06] between David and Jesse and he says you
[46:08] see David B tells Jays now where's Jesse
[46:14] he says then he says you see you see
[46:16] David what is doing he sexually
[46:18] demeaning you is thinking about Jesus
[46:20] you are nothing
[46:21] that's the data now if you don't know
[46:24] the enemy you are going to fall for that
[46:26] trip and I start to look at your brother
[46:28] in your wrong way then when he finishes
[46:31] with you he proposes he goes to David
[46:33] and say at this point it's disrespectful
[46:35] can you seem to you like that and I
[46:40] remember the dinner he knows what type
[46:42] of a battle he must bring to you if you
[46:44] are a I'm not standing in a strong
[46:46] and he knows that this one is thrown
[46:47] when I come to him I must bring strong
[46:49] demons I must bring babies when he come
[46:52] to boys he bring small small demons
[46:55] those ones of sleeping engines you are
[47:02] they're small when he comes to a balance
[47:04] and other than the Deacons well past us
[47:07] he smaller little demons when he can't
[47:09] bring he says hey guys you can't go to
[47:12] harm and just the two of you you must
[47:16] take that guy with extra special forces
[47:20] of the demons now the Lord do that also
[47:23] turn out the Lord has got so much
[47:25] confidence in me and you that we can be
[47:27] able to fight this battle because you
[47:30] know why that captain that might be part
[47:32] of the team is the Holy Spirit he's the
[47:34] captain
[47:35] brother Nasir on Sunday the captain who
[47:38] is the Holy Spirit who is taught by
[47:40] Joshua he's the one who lists us he's
[47:44] the one who did the forces that same one
[47:47] Joshua made and Joshua said who are you
[47:49] for us or against us and he drew the
[47:52] sword he's a lamb I'm the captain
[47:54] there is about in worshiping he
[47:57] worshiped that's why because you are the
[47:59] captain he's the Holy Spirit is the one
[48:01] who leads us if we learn how to listen
[48:03] to orders of the captain and have that
[48:06] experience then we shall be able to
[48:09] fight this battle we shall be able to
[48:11] know that for God so loved the world we
[48:15] shall be able to look at people out
[48:17] there as creatures that God wants to
[48:19] save not as this sin us
[48:22] oh these gangs oh these people oh that
[48:25] sister oh no no the Prophet says you
[48:28] don't look at your sister
[48:29] don't look at your brother why because
[48:32] you're a soldier you you're holding a
[48:34] gun can you imagine us all joined the
[48:37] battle holding a gun fighting and then
[48:39] but looking at another soldier like this
[48:40] huh if even you think that's not on the
[48:44] trigger he's looking at this ah that
[48:46] that Center is not ut-oh
[48:50] then they should do what fighting you
[48:57] are supposed to be only a post of duty
[48:59] it's not your job to be saying AHA
[49:01] system run man named brother Ben you
[49:07] know if I was the past I'll do better
[49:09] no no no that's not my job that's not
[49:11] our job that's the job of the Lord who
[49:14] gave him that calling your job is to
[49:16] support him to make sure that if he's
[49:19] shooting you are behind him brother ever
[49:20] a man was preaching then you shoot and
[49:23] you see the enemy coming towards him is
[49:24] not our
[49:25] you shoot the enemy amen but you cannot
[49:27] do that if you don't have those I'm
[49:30] amazed that you are talking about our
[49:32] we'll talk about them at that time well
[49:34] what what do you need now how do you
[49:36] fight this battle how do you fight it
[49:40] how do you go about fighting this battle
[49:42] for winning because the enemy is
[49:44] fighting every day now
[49:47] you might try to take your thoughts
[49:49] everyone visit Toki he can dress a
[49:51] brother okay
[49:52] I can't even hear him no no you can hear
[49:54] me you just have to listen the enemy the
[49:58] enemy the enemy just who do anything say
[50:00] very bad enemy if he fights haphazardly
[50:03] he he just you know I don't know how to
[50:05] explain it but he just makes things
[50:06] mixed up he was you know in the dust but
[50:08] the time the dust settles he finished
[50:10] with you so we need to know the time of
[50:12] an enemy and be ready for him so that we
[50:14] can be able to overcome him I'm gonna
[50:16] stop here I've taken already ten minutes
[50:18] more
[50:18] eight minutes more so may the Lord bless
[50:20] you and then we are going to to play
[50:24] together and then I'm so sorry please
[50:28] forgive me for going for the time I love
[50:36] this message so much one day appreciated
[50:48] okay thank you so much thank you so much
[50:51] because because the Prophet read those
[50:53] two scriptures if not more amen
[50:56] let's see it first first Peter father
[50:58] Peter I see here yeah first Peter 5:8
[51:05] 210 thank you for reminding me
[51:09] first Peter 5:8 then you'll hear what he
[51:16] says is this now this is part of how you
[51:19] need to fight this battle he says be
[51:22] sober sober you kind of fight it if you
[51:25] are not sober you need to be sober sober
[51:27] minded otherwise you are going to have
[51:30] your own thoughts and the enemy that's
[51:32] exactly where he wants you you know
[51:34] someone who's drunk by Luca is not sober
[51:36] he's not in his own right mind so be
[51:40] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[51:42] the devil is roaring work at about
[51:46] seeking whom he can devour who resist
[51:52] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[51:55] same afflictions are accomplished in
[51:59] your brethren that
[52:01] in that well amen
[52:05] but the God of all Grace who had called
[52:09] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[52:12] Jesus after death he have suffered a
[52:14] while made you perfect establish
[52:17] strengthen thank you that's the captain
[52:22] now that's what the captain does so so
[52:25] he does not let us to be in this battle
[52:27] for us to lose he doesn't let us to be
[52:29] in this battle for us to give up or to
[52:32] lose hope
[52:33] no he brings us in this battle for a
[52:35] purpose and his good that day we must I
[52:38] remember the back head one day a
[52:39] minister he said we must appreciate God
[52:42] for the test and the trial we must
[52:44] appreciate God for that because if we
[52:47] don't get files and temptations and
[52:48] tests how else are we going to look like
[52:51] Jesus Christ how else we must have those
[52:54] things but for us is to fight patiently
[52:57] to know you know I always say is easy to
[53:00] say and to do so we must come to the
[53:03] point where we say no no it's easy to to
[53:05] than to say Amen
[53:07] so you must do more than saying it so
[53:11] may God help us amen and we are going to
[53:16] pray together and then but I love this
