[10:53] sister belinda
[10:54] and sister litava that's going to give

[10:59] sister belinda do you need the guitar
[11:18] [Music]
[11:30] god bless you um praise the lord it's so
[11:34] good to be here
[11:36] and just a wonderful presence you know
[11:38] it shows people that really know their
[11:40] god
[11:40] there's an atmosphere that comes you
[11:42] know and i believe and i can say it's
[11:45] here tonight
[11:46] um this song is called stand still and
[11:49] let god move
[11:50] and it was on my heart this week um you
[11:53] know
[11:54] it's not always easy but
[11:57] praise the lord getting there you know
[11:59] just
[12:00] i believe that's the key actually is to
[12:03] let god move you know and um
[12:05] the song i don't know who wrote it but
[12:07] there's some extra verses been added
[12:09] obviously
[12:10] since after the covert 19. and um
[12:14] and i'm thinking of you know the prophet
[12:15] spoke about
[12:17] when he was in germany that time and he
[12:19] saw a painting and it's called the cloud
[12:21] land
[12:22] and from a far distance it looks like a
[12:24] real horrible sight
[12:26] it's gloomy and dark and it's not until
[12:29] you walk right up on it
[12:31] that you see it's actually angel's wings
[12:34] they are shouting hallelujah he says
[12:36] so sometimes it's like that for us it
[12:39] might be gloomy it might be dark
[12:41] but we just need to draw so much closer
[12:43] to him
[12:44] and be certain of god and then we can
[12:46] see his own
[12:47] angels in disguise so praise the lord
[12:51] that's our god
[12:52] he's the one that created all things
[12:56] [Music]
[12:59] the father has a plan
[13:03] though it's hard to see it now
[13:07] i feel you walking all alone
[13:11] he is there no doubt
[13:14] when the storm around your ages
[13:18] and you're tossed to and fro
[13:21] when you're faced with life's decisions
[13:25] and not sure which way to go
[13:28] stand still
[13:32] watch god move
[13:36] standing still
[13:39] is hard to do
[13:44] when you feel you have reached the earth
[13:47] he'll make a way
[13:49] for you stand still
[13:54] and not good moves
[13:59] the enemy surrounds you
[14:02] and the wars are closing in
[14:06] when the tide is swiftly rising
[14:10] and you wonder where he's been
[14:14] there has never been a moment
[14:18] that is arms when reaching out
[14:21] you can rest assured and be secure
[14:25] god is moving right now
[14:28] stand
[14:31] [Music]
[14:36] standing still is hard to do
[14:51] standing still
[14:55] and watch good news
[15:03] many are afraid don't know what to do
[15:05] [Music]
[15:07] they panicking despair
[15:10] as this plague is moving through
[15:14] but a precious pride of christ
[15:18] he says to you don't you fear
[15:22] just the blood the token is given
[15:27] [Music]
[15:36] standing still
[15:41] [Music]
[15:51] stand still
[15:55] [Music]
[15:59] remember back in genesis
[16:03] the earth without forming void
[16:07] and darkness was upon him
[16:11] everything had died
[16:14] remember how god moved
[16:17] he brought it back to life
[16:21] spoke into existence
[16:25] let there be light stand
[16:29] [Music]
[16:30] still and watch
[16:37] still is hard to do
[16:43] when you feel your average seal
[16:47] he'll make a way for
[16:50] [Music]
[17:01] see how they panicked and
[17:04] cried saw the egyptians coming
[17:09] and so they all would die
[17:13] but then the prophet moses cried
[17:16] today you see them no more
[17:21] see the salvation of your god
[17:24] fear not just stand still
[17:32] [Music]
[17:42] it's not a storm it's only angels
[17:50] it's a blessing in
[17:52] [Music]
[17:59] little disguise watch god move
[18:05] for there's a man here who can turn on
[18:08] the light

[29:35] heaven he answered and said unto them
[29:37] when in this evening it will be fair
[29:38] weather for the sky is red and in the
[29:40] morning in the morning it will be foul
[29:42] weather today for the sky
[29:45] is red and lowering oh you hypocrites
[29:47] you can discern the face of the sky but
[29:49] you can
[29:50] but can you not discern the signs of the
[29:52] times
[29:54] amen my little bless is where you can
[29:56] take your seats um this uh
[29:57] this evening okay do we have a little
[30:01] tissue here
[30:04] i don't have covered but i've just got a
[30:06] runny nose
[30:11] so i've got quite a lot to get
[30:15] through this evening it's not really a
[30:18] lot but just
[30:20] but i'm going to go through it quite
[30:21] fast but as i always say you look like a
[30:23] very intelligent bunch of people to me
[30:27] so so i'm just going to run through this
[30:30] it's really fast um
[30:31] and i'm what i'm going to say is i
[30:34] believe it to be the truth it's very
[30:35] simple
[30:36] thought it's not it's not anything that
[30:37] is going to be
[30:39] out of left field or anything i don't
[30:40] have the capacity to do that
[30:42] not that intelligent but it's going to
[30:46] be truth but i'll just go around a few
[30:47] different areas
[30:48] um around this but i'm not going to be
[30:52] afraid to speak it the way that i think
[30:53] that it is
[30:55] and i think i'm in the company that will
[30:56] understand that's what i'm trying to do
[30:58] you know so some of it could be deemed
[31:00] highly offensive but it doesn't matter
[31:01] because if it's the truth it's the truth
[31:04] right it doesn't now you'll see what i
[31:06] mean when i get through to different
[31:06] parts of it but
[31:08] but you'll know what i you'll understand
[31:10] what i'm saying when i get to it because
[31:11] it's just
[31:13] we can't be afraid just to speak the
[31:14] things as they are right but
[31:16] um and it's a little bit political but
[31:18] i'm but i
[31:19] am not going to be passionate about
[31:21] anything because i'm not political
[31:23] these days or i am for the kingdom of
[31:25] god you know so
[31:27] so that's what i'm going to get
[31:28] passionate about but other political
[31:29] stuff i don't
[31:30] i really have no time for because i see
[31:32] satan as involved in all of it
[31:35] okay so i'm i'm i'm very very over it
[31:37] all
[31:38] now let's get this going so once i start
[31:41] i'm gonna
[31:42] go very fast is that right okay cool
[31:45] thank you
[31:46] okay my sermon tonight is nothing new to
[31:47] you you're going to know what i'm
[31:48] talking about it's very easy it's called
[31:49] uniting time
[31:51] but this is front page news this was
[31:53] preached in back in the 60s but this is
[31:55] front page news
[31:56] what it's happening right now and con
[31:59] and
[32:00] i guess the the the things i'm going to
[32:02] touch on the communism denominationalism
[32:04] and the bride
[32:05] so now i've got this this idea of
[32:07] communism you know when we think of
[32:08] communism we often just think
[32:10] of um russia or china and this funny
[32:12] little thing that we've a lot of us here
[32:14] have had nothing to do with communism
[32:15] essentially in these
[32:17] western countries that we know of but
[32:19] brother branham
[32:20] his idea of when he talks about
[32:21] communism is not just to do with that
[32:23] it's to do with evil this
[32:24] godless evil force is what he's talking
[32:27] about you can't just refer it to i
[32:29] haven't seen any
[32:29] russians over here attacking us
[32:31] therefore communism isn't having an
[32:32] effect on us
[32:33] we've got to understand what he's
[32:34] meaning by communism he's talking about
[32:36] there's a spirit which is just an
[32:37] ungodly spirit he just calls it
[32:38] communism but it's not so much
[32:39] you know if they're not russian or
[32:40] chinese then don't worry about it sort
[32:41] of thing but i just want to run through
[32:43] these things about communism
[32:44] this is from a communist question of
[32:47] confession of faith
[32:49] um questions this is from you know karl
[32:51] marx he was him and another guy
[32:52] they sort of formed this idea of
[32:55] communism
[32:57] right he was german
[33:00] are you a communist yes to say he would
[33:02] answer right
[33:03] question two a question when are you a
[33:05] communist yes question two what is the
[33:06] aim of the communist
[33:07] answer to organize society in such a way
[33:09] that every member of it can develop and
[33:11] use all its capabilities and powers and
[33:12] complete freedom
[33:14] and without thereby infringing on the
[33:15] basic conditions of the society
[33:17] good question three how do you wish to
[33:20] achieve this
[33:20] aim answer by the elimination of private
[33:23] property and its replacement by
[33:24] community of property
[33:25] property so this is now communism right
[33:27] now the idea of it is very actually
[33:29] actually very good this if that was
[33:30] all there was it's a good idea that's
[33:33] not all just one person hoard everything
[33:34] that shield around everyone has you know
[33:36] gets to use all the stuff and it's a
[33:37] very it's a very good idea
[33:38] and i've got a quote from brother
[33:39] branham saying that same thing he said
[33:40] well communism is right
[33:42] you know the idea is right but not
[33:43] forced like that russia communism is
[33:45] only a revival of the devil like
[33:47] pentecost said pentecost had real
[33:48] communism
[33:49] everybody sold everything freely and
[33:50] divided among them so the early church
[33:52] were actually communists they had
[33:53] everything in common
[33:55] that's the truth because acts 2 44 says
[33:58] and all that believed and all that
[34:00] belief were together and all had all
[34:01] things in common
[34:02] right communism and they sold their
[34:03] possessions of goods and parted them to
[34:04] all men as if men had need
[34:06] right then that's a very good idea we
[34:09] may get back to that
[34:11] that's the way they were right another
[34:13] verse here
[34:14] and neither was there any among them
[34:15] that lacked for as many as were
[34:16] possessors of lands or houses sold them
[34:19] and brought the prices of the things
[34:20] that were sold and laid them down at the
[34:22] apostles feet and distribution was made
[34:23] unto every man according to as he had
[34:25] need
[34:25] communist socialist there you go very
[34:27] good okay now
[34:29] and brother and says i made the
[34:30] statement in the federal court so i said
[34:32] if communism had christianity in it i'd
[34:34] be a communist
[34:35] okay because the principle is very good
[34:37] right but i can't be because it denies
[34:39] christianity is there anything wrong
[34:40] with it right
[34:41] now now that keep in mind this thought
[34:44] here hijacking a good cause for evil
[34:45] intent because i've got to i'm going to
[34:46] come back to this thought later on
[34:48] and this is what satan does all the way
[34:49] through and i'm gonna touch on
[34:51] on a current affair that's happening to
[34:53] to point this out to you but you'll see
[34:54] when i get there
[34:55] so now um if we go through to the next
[34:58] question this is down down the line a
[35:00] bit question 22 was
[35:01] do communists reject existing religions
[35:04] answer
[35:05] all religions which have existed
[35:06] hitherto were expressions of historical
[35:08] stages of
[35:09] development of individual peoples or
[35:10] groups of peoples but communism is that
[35:13] stage of historical development which
[35:15] makes all existing religions superfluous
[35:17] and supersedes them
[35:19] so essentially saying when you get to
[35:20] the point of communism of this this
[35:21] brand of communism then all religion all
[35:23] god everything is out of the picture you
[35:25] no longer need that
[35:26] it's done away with and that's that's
[35:28] always been the driving force behind
[35:29] communism it's it's godless you know
[35:31] we we can do without god we don't need
[35:33] god right that's the
[35:34] and that's that's the motivation that
[35:36] that that drives this thing
[35:38] and brother brown says here so now he's
[35:41] starting to get onto the idea of
[35:42] communism the way that he's describing
[35:44] it
[35:44] see that great intellectual that we all
[35:46] so hold to what's communism today what
[35:48] is their god it's the intellectual
[35:50] science what are we doing anyhow um
[35:52] where are we living consider these words
[35:53] today so he's saying it's
[35:55] when he talks communist he's talking
[35:57] about this evil godless
[35:59] smart educated group you know that
[36:01] that's what he's saying it is
[36:02] now we find out that he sprayed this
[36:04] poison spray and that spray was a spray
[36:06] of modern understanding education
[36:08] science and the civilization the very
[36:10] things that we cherish so much
[36:11] did you ever stop to think that our
[36:12] great enemy and the natural life today
[36:14] among the nations is communism
[36:15] what is the god of communism
[36:17] civilization and education science
[36:18] that's right isn't it
[36:19] that's what they live on and thrive on
[36:21] it's science scientific sciences the god
[36:23] of science now
[36:23] if you adjust with the poison spray of
[36:25] modern civilization science and
[36:27] education so now when he's talking
[36:28] communism that's what he's talking about
[36:29] not so much russia and china if you
[36:31] understand what i mean he's saying
[36:32] there's a
[36:32] driving godless spirit behind us okay
[36:35] um and then he's one so then in the 30s
[36:38] or 40s he says
[36:40] during the prophecy actually before that
[36:41] he said there will be three great isms
[36:42] communism fascism and nazism he said
[36:44] they'll wind up in one ism and that
[36:46] ism will dominate the world and will
[36:47] burn the vatican city and you remember
[36:49] me saying that years and years and years
[36:50] ago in just
[36:51] exactly that way so he's saying
[36:52] communism is going to be the ism that
[36:53] will
[36:54] eventually dominate to destroy the
[36:57] catholic the catholic church okay now
[37:00] i'm just going to touch on a few of the
[37:01] places where communism took hold
[37:03] and see if it actually did a great job
[37:05] or not
[37:06] but how can you with a godless mentality
[37:09] right so
[37:10] so um these guys here vladimir lenin
[37:13] he was inspired by it there these guys
[37:15] start off as socialists and they take on
[37:17] this
[37:17] they read they read the books they read
[37:19] karl marx's writings and they think
[37:20] that's going to be a great idea
[37:21] so this guy in a political sense he did
[37:23] quite well vladimir lenin to eventually
[37:25] end up ruling russia
[37:27] he fought a hard fight to get there and
[37:28] then so then he wanted to bring his idea
[37:30] of communism into
[37:31] to russia and once he died then joseph
[37:34] stalin carried on the idea
[37:36] they were they were working together so
[37:38] um
[37:39] and they implemented you know communism
[37:41] according to karl marx
[37:42] with the the slight variance of it but
[37:43] essentially um
[37:45] that's what they did but they it
[37:47] involved a lot of change and it evolved
[37:49] adjusting things and and it was very bad
[37:51] for the country um
[37:53] so this is the outcome of communism in
[37:55] that place that i'll just read this this
[37:57] just there's a there
[37:58] were a lot of bad things but this is one
[37:59] that month stalin and
[38:01] yoshi have signed order number zero zero
[38:03] four four seven listing 268
[38:05] 950 people for a rest of whom 79 950
[38:08] were executed
[38:09] he also initiated national operations
[38:11] the ethnic cleansing of soviet
[38:13] of non-soviet ethnic groups among them
[38:14] poles germans latvians finns greeks
[38:17] koreans and chinese
[38:18] through internal or external exile
[38:20] during these years approximately 1.6
[38:21] million were arrested
[38:23] seven and seven hundred thousand were
[38:25] shot in an unknown number died
[38:27] under nkvd torture so
[38:30] you're talking about a million people
[38:31] killed for different to for this
[38:35] cause so that's that's the outcome of
[38:38] communism there
[38:39] however i've just got this interesting
[38:40] quote that i just threw in here
[38:42] brother adam says but everyone tells you
[38:44] we hear a lot of propaganda that
[38:45] russia's all communists and
[38:46] you go in there don't you believe that
[38:48] nonsense there's millions of christians
[38:49] in russia
[38:50] well you know that russia there's only
[38:51] one percent of russia in the whole
[38:52] there's communists
[38:53] that's government statistics one percent
[38:55] what russia needs is a revival
[38:57] they need meat of god to stand out with
[38:58] something real it's amazing how these
[39:00] guys got into power when there's so few
[39:01] of them because it was actually
[39:02] and i found this other statistic here
[39:04] this is obviously statistics now but
[39:06] there is no official census of religion
[39:08] and russian estimates are based on
[39:09] surveys according
[39:10] to a 2012 street arena survey 46.6
[39:14] percent of the russian population is
[39:16] christian including 41
[39:17] russian orthodox however later that year
[39:19] the levada center determined that 76
[39:21] of russians are christians and in june
[39:23] 2013 public opinion foundation
[39:25] determined that 65
[39:26] of russians then another one determined
[39:28] there's about 77 percent
[39:29] so so these guys were all saying that
[39:31] there's about there's about 78
[39:33] 70 of russians are christians even
[39:35] though it's a communist country
[39:36] right so so maybe back when in the 50s
[39:39] fought
[39:40] when brother brown was talking about it
[39:41] there was even a lot more proportion of
[39:43] christians there
[39:44] not that that means anything for this
[39:45] but now i want to carry on we see our
[39:47] world at bankruptcy we see communism
[39:49] sweeping in
[39:50] an ungodly spirit called the iron
[39:51] curtain which was russia that spirit
[39:53] coming in there
[39:54] we see one rising under in china called
[39:56] the bamboo curtain and we see one rise
[39:58] called the purple curtain the roman
[39:59] curtain taking over the world now you
[40:00] gotta
[40:01] understand this is the 50s when these
[40:03] these movements were in the height of
[40:04] their power when
[40:05] when there was a lot of killing and a
[40:06] lot of that sort of stuff were going on
[40:07] and during this time so this this was a
[40:09] big deal in the
[40:10] 50s and because because now we'll go to
[40:12] this one you had
[40:13] and china at the same time you had mao
[40:15] zedong and china
[40:16] bringing in communism to to china and
[40:19] the
[40:20] results were similar to what the results
[40:22] they had in russia
[40:23] and i'll just read you some of the stuff
[40:24] um this is
[40:26] a 55 to 57 you know we hear other
[40:28] sermons from 55 this is from 57 well at
[40:30] the same time this is happening
[40:31] in china mao launched the super movement
[40:33] and the anti-rightist campaign
[40:35] with at least 550 000 people persecuted
[40:37] in the latter
[40:38] most affirmative intellectuals and
[40:40] dissidents in 1958 he launched the great
[40:42] leap forward which
[40:44] turned out to be a great leap backward
[40:47] that aimed to rapidly transform china's
[40:49] economy from
[40:50] agrarian to industrial which led to the
[40:52] deadliest famine in history in the
[40:53] deaths of
[40:54] 20 to 46 million people in 1958 and 1962
[40:58] so during those years he listened to the
[40:59] sermons
[41:00] 20 milli 20 to 40 million chinese
[41:02] starved to death because of a famine
[41:03] because of this effects of trying to
[41:04] bring communism this certain idea into a
[41:07] country
[41:08] and then in 63 male launched the
[41:11] socialist education movement and in 66
[41:13] he initiated
[41:14] initiated the cultural revolution a
[41:15] program to remove counter-revolutionary
[41:17] elements
[41:18] in chinese society which lasted ten
[41:19] years it was marked by violent class
[41:21] struggle widespread
[41:22] destruction of cultural artefacts and
[41:24] unprecedented elevation of mao's cult of
[41:26] personality tens of millions of people
[41:27] were persecuted during the revolution
[41:29] well the estimated number of deaths
[41:31] ranges from hundreds of thousands to
[41:32] millions no one knows how many died but
[41:34] there were a lot um
[41:38] at that time okay so now this is what's
[41:42] happening in the timeline brother and
[41:43] i'm speaking this and so i've just got a
[41:44] few quote series is
[41:46] all of our subjects is on communism beat
[41:48] communism out i hear it until i get sick
[41:49] of listening to it i'm against it too
[41:51] certainly i'm against it
[41:52] because everyone all the preachers are
[41:53] preaching about this got this bad
[41:54] communism but he's saying i'm more
[41:55] against the man or woman that rejects
[41:57] christ the word or whether
[41:58] you be a preacher or whatever you are
[41:59] you are more indebted to christ than to
[42:01] the communist he is ignorant and knows
[42:03] nothing about it you're supposed to know
[42:04] see you can discern the time of
[42:06] communism but you can't discern the sign
[42:08] of the day you're living in
[42:09] because at the time that was you know it
[42:10] was there it was everything
[42:12] what's the matter with the preachers
[42:14] today this is in 62.
[42:16] um communism every preacher is out there
[42:18] trying to fight communism
[42:19] he says communism nothing the thing the
[42:21] devil is weaving right under your nose
[42:22] and you don't know it is romanism
[42:24] denominationalism and rome is the mother
[42:25] of denominations the bible says she was
[42:27] a [ __ ] and her daughters were harlots
[42:28] against god against his word
[42:30] okay for the hour is coming when
[42:31] communism is swallowing them countries
[42:34] up and they'll not be privileged to
[42:35] preach the gospel because it
[42:36] does away with god that's what mel did
[42:38] actually in that that time too he shut
[42:40] down all the churches
[42:40] so you couldn't have any churches from
[42:42] the 60s to the 70s there were no
[42:45] no churches at all not even the three
[42:46] south church i don't think which is the
[42:48] official um
[42:50] chinese one for the hours coming well
[42:53] com when communism is sweeping them
[42:54] countries up and they'll not be
[42:55] privileged to preach the gospel while
[42:56] the door is open may every missionary
[42:58] minor person either go or support
[42:59] someone that can go so
[43:01] china was a funny place like that in a
[43:03] funny way because after the
[43:05] um i think when mao died in about the
[43:07] 80s it did open up they had
[43:09] economic reforms and the country opened
[43:11] up you know into the sort of 2000s
[43:13] it slowly opened up to where um i think
[43:16] they were more interested in making
[43:17] money than controlling what religion was
[43:19] doing so
[43:19] there's been a period it's coming to an
[43:21] end now but there has been a period
[43:23] where religion was
[43:24] eased up on you know you could there
[43:26] were a lot of home churches and the
[43:28] um what were they just not official
[43:31] there was a government official
[43:32] government church but there were a lot
[43:33] of home churches they they went on
[43:34] without any problems you know some of
[43:36] these churches were 1500 people big you
[43:37] know they just carried on they weren't
[43:39] an official church they were it was
[43:40] against the law but no one seemed to
[43:41] care because they
[43:42] were making money who cares about this
[43:44] whole thing it's changing now
[43:46] it's going back to the way it used to be
[43:47] like there's a there's a big crack down
[43:48] at the moment now on religion
[43:50] and on all these home churches like this
[43:51] church here they now meet they had i
[43:53] think 1500 people
[43:54] but they now meet um on riverbanks and
[43:56] things because they their churches have
[43:57] been shut down
[43:58] and this is i think that this is another
[44:00] one the police are always out the front
[44:01] of the building where the churches
[44:02] and they've closed the church this was
[44:04] maybe another thousand people in this
[44:05] church but
[44:06] there's at the moment it's going the
[44:08] other way so the this
[44:10] the there's a push to stop these
[44:12] churches operating
[44:13] okay and don't ever underestimate
[44:16] satan's power of deceiving don't you
[44:17] never underestimate him he's smooth as
[44:19] can be and the antichrist spirit isn't
[44:20] communism so as bad as this whole
[44:22] thing appears he's saying it's not
[44:23] that's not that's not the antichrist
[44:25] spirit that
[44:26] that he's that he's fighting against
[44:27] anyway all right
[44:29] the united states will come to a time
[44:31] that church and state will unite
[44:32] together
[44:32] and the protestant and catholic will
[44:34] throw their things together to fight
[44:35] communism
[44:36] and that's exactly playing into the
[44:37] hands of what god said right here okay
[44:39] he says the next one great big
[44:40] evangelical church of the protestants
[44:42] will cooperate
[44:43] and join them with catholicism to combat
[44:45] communism
[44:46] right so now he's starting to say this
[44:49] is what's going to happen is we're going
[44:50] to see this as the big evil and the
[44:51] churches are going to combine together
[44:53] and to fight off this evil okay so now
[44:56] this is where we might get controversial
[44:57] but but i want to point out some of the
[44:58] modern day events that are happening to
[45:00] to understand there's a force that's
[45:02] happening we're in a very very
[45:04] vicious war at the moment and it's only
[45:06] going to get worse
[45:07] and the war is spewing out into the open
[45:10] it's a it's a it's a
[45:14] we've got to know where we stand in this
[45:16] war
[45:18] otherwise we're going to get sucked into
[45:19] this whole thing but let me tell you
[45:20] it's a raging war
[45:22] you there's never been there will never
[45:24] be a war like this again on the face of
[45:25] the earth
[45:26] because it's going to be a global war of
[45:27] ideas and it's going to play out in
[45:29] different places and
[45:30] the bride needs to know what's going on
[45:33] where do we stand
[45:35] where do we fight you see because we can
[45:37] easily get caught up in a war that we're
[45:39] not supposed to be
[45:40] have any part of right so right so just
[45:43] i want to bring this on
[45:44] so now we're going to get this idea of
[45:46] hijacking a good cause for evil intent
[45:47] once again right okay so i know you're
[45:50] something that
[45:51] that um well this is my next blm and
[45:54] communism how i want to show you this is
[45:55] not the only place where communism is
[45:57] coming in but it's coming in
[45:58] this is just the most current affair so
[46:00] it's front page news but it's been
[46:01] happening for a long time news media
[46:03] everything that's been coming in from
[46:04] all angles
[46:05] people are people like believers not
[46:07] believers christians are now starting to
[46:09] wake up to it and think wow there's a
[46:10] spaghetti coming in all around me i've
[46:11] got to fight back that's what's
[46:12] happening at the moment
[46:13] there's a war brewing massive massive
[46:16] war brewing
[46:16] huge global war and rome is actually
[46:19] going to win for an hour
[46:21] and dominate but and but it's a massive
[46:23] war and
[46:25] it's amazing what's happening at the
[46:26] moment it's such an exciting time to be
[46:27] living in because this was
[46:28] spoken in the 60s and we can basically
[46:30] read a script and say this is what's
[46:31] going to happen
[46:32] and we can watch it and we we read the
[46:34] news we see it all playing out we think
[46:35] well this is exactly what brother evan
[46:36] said would happen right
[46:38] so now here if you can read that now
[46:40] this is brother i'm speaking i've told
[46:41] you here in this pulpit martin luther
[46:42] king is the greatest independent the
[46:44] color people ever had right
[46:45] that man's going to lead a thousand of
[46:47] them to a slaughter
[46:48] that's right inspired by communism let
[46:50] me prove my point i said that about two
[46:51] years ago look what's happening right
[46:53] now
[46:54] um they said they were fighting for
[46:55] integration and when the law gave them
[46:56] integration new people that don't
[46:58] believe in integration be ashamed of you
[46:59] our nation permits integration and we
[47:01] should
[47:01] do what the big boss says that's exactly
[47:03] right and now you say
[47:04] now to come to places and so forth like
[47:06] that is shopping and sit in the back of
[47:07] the bus and so forth no sir the lord
[47:09] says he just the same as we are
[47:10] so we're the same as they are so let's
[47:12] act that way let's be that way and
[47:13] that's exactly what all the really true
[47:15] born again people believe and now i
[47:16] believe that's in their heart
[47:17] right now now this is straightforward
[47:19] stuff this is like like a christian
[47:21] a born-again christian doesn't think
[47:22] like that right it's like saying if i
[47:24] let the keys to brother so-and-so to
[47:26] pick something up from the church you
[47:27] know
[47:27] i don't know brother you might steal
[47:28] things from the church you know it's
[47:30] like hey come on
[47:30] the guy's a believer you know thou shalt
[47:32] not steal he's not going to steal things
[47:34] the second commandment is uh they also
[47:36] love their neighbor as itself you know
[47:37] if you're a believer your neighbor is
[47:38] whoever's next to you no matter what
[47:40] color they are that
[47:40] that's how the christian operates right
[47:42] so so there's no need to
[47:44] to try and oh i've got a lot of this
[47:45] sort of friend that's free off i'm not
[47:46] like that believers aren't like that
[47:47] full stop you know
[47:48] they won't get past the the chastisement
[47:51] of the holy ghost
[47:52] if they've got that wrong mentality
[47:53] right so that that's so
[47:55] say look just to get that aside that
[47:56] they say that that's what it is but
[47:58] to still approach it in a in a way it
[48:01] carries on
[48:02] well now what is it now to show you this
[48:04] is the movement back in the 60s
[48:06] now to show you that it's communism and
[48:08] not them colored people say
[48:09] it's an idea but it's been hijacked by
[48:11] this idea of communism
[48:12] that that's how communism has always
[48:14] come in to take over they do that in
[48:15] every nation
[48:16] that's how they do it getting you
[48:17] fighting amongst one another revolution
[48:19] and they take
[48:20] in without a shot they don't want to
[48:22] block the country they want it
[48:23] they can wound weed it in and now
[48:25] they've seen a case of doing that and
[48:26] now
[48:27] what your revolution was they thought
[48:28] they'd start another revolution be
[48:30] saying
[48:30] they're coming in from a different
[48:31] they're hijacking a and an
[48:34] agenda that is a good agenda but they're
[48:35] hijacking it for a
[48:37] an evil intention right okay so let me
[48:39] know i've got these few this is one of
[48:41] the co-founders of the
[48:42] blm movement and i've got a little quote
[48:44] that she said you probably can't read
[48:45] that at the bottom but it says
[48:47] that we actually do have she's just
[48:48] speaking speaking of speech we actually
[48:50] do have an ideological
[48:51] frame myself and alicia which was the
[48:53] co-founders of an actual
[48:55] movement not just an idea but a movement
[48:57] like an organization at trained
[48:59] organizers we are trained marxists
[49:01] we are supervised on that so she's
[49:03] saying she's saying we are communist we
[49:04] are trained marxists you know
[49:06] from karl marx that so this is not a
[49:08] secret right
[49:10] right so now here's
[49:13] oh that was the next part of the quote
[49:14] right
[49:16] just to show you the battle that's
[49:17] that's going on that it's this is a
[49:18] battle of
[49:19] this is a spiritual a created spiritual
[49:22] battle
[49:23] it okay this is what's happening and
[49:26] just this is just one instance but it's
[49:27] happening in
[49:28] every area of life every area of life
[49:31] right
[49:32] and i've got these two guys up here this
[49:34] is a um
[49:35] this was an interview on cnn now people
[49:37] joke about cnn you know it's called
[49:39] cable news network but people joke
[49:40] around say it's communist news network
[49:41] you know because
[49:42] it's well known that okay they're from
[49:44] the left sort of communist side and
[49:45] they're fighting against this way and
[49:46] other organizations are this way and
[49:48] that's how this is all unfolding right
[49:50] um and so one of the the guys on cnn is
[49:54] saying
[49:54] that uh they're trying to shut down the
[49:57] other guy because he's saying
[49:58] i don't agree with this movement it's
[49:59] wrong and because he's a he's more of a
[50:01] conservative right
[50:02] they're both the same they should both
[50:04] be going for the same thing but
[50:05] one is talking but they're they're not
[50:07] arguing on whether
[50:08] the ideal itself is right they're
[50:09] arguing on the direction they're both
[50:11] coming from in a spiritual sense
[50:13] do you understand now so that so that
[50:15] the caption under here was very good
[50:17] that it says so what is black lives
[50:18] matter really about
[50:19] this now this is just facts of what
[50:20] people are thinking right
[50:22] many conservatives and such black lives
[50:24] matter as a marxist anti-police racial
[50:26] organization that wants to tear down
[50:27] america
[50:28] meanwhile most liberals simply view
[50:30] black lives matter as a heroic movement
[50:32] and powerful slogan signaling support
[50:35] for racial justice and
[50:36] opposition to police brutality and he
[50:39] says both are right
[50:40] there's black lives matter trademark
[50:42] organization and then there's black
[50:44] lives matter
[50:45] as a as a good idea right right and so
[50:48] but they're both coming
[50:49] so they're both right but they're both
[50:51] both ideas of who they are right but it
[50:53] depends what side they're coming from
[50:54] okay you understand that that makes
[50:56] sense right so they put it well now
[50:59] and now there's because these narratives
[51:01] that get pushed that don't like to be
[51:02] exposed like like
[51:03] like these guys are totally against
[51:05] these are conservative guys you know
[51:06] they don't look like they should be
[51:07] conservative but they're conservatives
[51:09] and they're against the
[51:10] the movement because they can see the
[51:13] the nature that it is
[51:14] in their opinion right they're saying
[51:16] this is an evil intended
[51:18] uh communist movement we're against it
[51:20] and anyone that's conservative
[51:22] christian in this time a lot of them are
[51:24] forming this sort of camp right
[51:25] and so these guys they will play this
[51:27] video of like they say look there's
[51:29] here's these black lives matter people
[51:30] processing outside of church and
[51:32] screaming at people why are you serving
[51:34] god and why are you going to church in
[51:35] that he's saying what's that got to do
[51:36] with the policemen up the road
[51:37] you know in the end you know and this
[51:40] and you've got races on both sides that
[51:41] you've got the guy
[51:42] and the and the tires goes to the church
[51:44] you know why are you going to church you
[51:45] should be ashamed of yourself and
[51:46] you know and then you've got the you
[51:49] know little babe
[51:50] kids walking past and the guy's yelling
[51:52] at his megaphone this little kid you
[51:53] know it's it's
[51:54] it's he's saying hang on this is this is
[51:56] more than just a
[51:58] you know what's going on here right now
[52:00] i'm just saying this is as information
[52:02] right so you can get the idea
[52:04] of this war that's brewing between a lot
[52:06] of
[52:07] a lot of factions and i want to show you
[52:09] we
[52:10] we're not supposed to be part of it it's
[52:12] very very it's a
[52:14] which i'll show you what camp we're in
[52:15] in a little bit but i just want to read
[52:16] you some of these quotes right because
[52:17] this is now what's
[52:18] what's starting to happen in the world
[52:19] are people are in their opinion waking
[52:22] up to this evil you know
[52:24] but they're not really waking up to it
[52:26] they've been sucked into it right it's
[52:28] it's amazing what's happening we've
[52:30] known this for a long time now here's
[52:32] some of the comments hey correct me if
[52:33] i'm wrong but isn't that religious
[52:34] persecution shouldn't that count as a
[52:36] hate crime you know
[52:36] doing that and and someone else anyone
[52:39] else getting tired of
[52:40] someone else straight up demons are
[52:41] coming after christians once again
[52:42] history repeats itself
[52:44] another quote it's a marxist movement
[52:45] destroying history and religion to have
[52:47] their former government establish
[52:48] communist socialists beyond
[52:50] heartbreaking seeing the nation being
[52:51] hijacked
[52:53] right now i'm not saying that person's
[52:54] right to said that but i'm saying
[52:56] there's this movement to understand
[52:58] what's happening because they're saying
[52:59] there's this big communist movement
[53:01] happening and we've got to stand up
[53:02] against it right
[53:04] this is a war this is actual war that
[53:06] we're involved in
[53:08] and it's kind of getting it's getting
[53:13] you don't even want to keep up with it
[53:14] because it's crazy like this lady here
[53:16] is a police chief in seattle seattle
[53:18] they've had riots and stuff like that
[53:19] and you know abolish the police and all
[53:20] that kind of stuff
[53:21] and she's saying and the police chief
[53:23] which is actually an african-american
[53:25] woman resigned she said i can't do this
[53:26] anymore i've had enough this is just
[53:28] there's no respect for the police i'm
[53:29] resigning this is a you know
[53:31] as a result of a movement that's
[53:33] supposed to be for her you know
[53:35] and making a resign and she's saying
[53:37] she's saying the problem is you guys are
[53:38] cutting the funding to the police force
[53:39] this is in the article
[53:40] and now we've hired a whole lot of new
[53:42] police that are minority groups and that
[53:43] to come in and
[53:44] to increase the diversity of our police
[53:46] force and now we have to lay them all
[53:47] off
[53:47] see what's the point of this now now
[53:50] that you can see there's another
[53:52] intention behind this this movement
[53:53] which is not just this it's not limited
[53:55] to this it's all over the place but
[53:56] you get what i'm saying this is just the
[53:58] current one
[54:00] i don't think i uh yeah i'll read this
[54:02] because this is just now people's
[54:03] commentary on the situation right
[54:05] this is mrs cullers is one of the
[54:07] founders that said she was a marxist
[54:08] as unapologetic in describing black
[54:10] lives matter founders as trained
[54:11] marxists
[54:12] so it's worth examining the words that
[54:13] inspire their deeds marxism the 19th
[54:15] century
[54:16] worldview system systemized by german
[54:18] revolutionary
[54:19] karl marx is fundamentally atheistic
[54:22] when you know god
[54:22] it subscribes to a theory that matter
[54:24] physical stuff compromises the
[54:26] fundamental reality of human existence
[54:28] the transcendent experiences of the
[54:30] human heart are regarded as nothing more
[54:32] than biochemistry like there's no god
[54:33] there's none of that
[54:34] fantasies of brain function stuff
[54:37] whether molecule or man
[54:38] is just soulless stuff and short matter
[54:40] doesn't really matter you know we're
[54:41] just nothing we come from nobody who
[54:42] cares
[54:42] that's saying that's his idea now this
[54:45] is where
[54:45] this is where the war starts raging
[54:47] right clearly marxism stands in
[54:49] diametric opposition to the judo
[54:50] christian foundation of america or this
[54:53] you know which views each person is
[54:54] infused with a spirit abounded by time
[54:56] and space a manifestation of an
[54:58] omnipotent creator human lives matter
[54:59] all of them a belief under good and the
[55:01] american founding in the declaration of
[55:03] independence we hold these truths to be
[55:04] self-evident that all men are created
[55:06] equal that they are endowed with their
[55:08] by their credit or certain unalienable
[55:10] rights
[55:11] these among that among them are life
[55:13] liberty and their pursuit of happiness
[55:14] right so they're saying these these two
[55:16] thoughts are at opposing ends of the
[55:17] scale
[55:17] this is this these will be non
[55:19] non-christian people essentially saying
[55:21] this it's not this is not a christian
[55:22] view this is a
[55:23] you know what i'm saying but i just
[55:24] wanted to put it out there for right too
[55:28] but to show you that the fight is all
[55:30] over the place
[55:32] and it's been created to this left and
[55:34] right fight right and
[55:35] that's that's that's evil it's of satan
[55:37] like
[55:38] like you the the camps have been
[55:40] separated to create a big
[55:42] division because we are
[55:45] i'm left and i'm right i believe i'm a
[55:46] socialist communist as far as
[55:48] they're good and i'm this way but but i
[55:50] can't be a
[55:51] i can't be a left-leaning person without
[55:53] him i have to support
[55:54] like uh um abortion i'm expected to
[55:58] support that and then be against god you
[55:59] know but i'm like hang on i i
[56:01] don't support their support these other
[56:02] things but then see how you get put in
[56:04] camps and that's what's been trying to
[56:05] happen as you get put in camp
[56:06] you go to the right i believe in some of
[56:08] those principles but where they are too
[56:09] hard on people and
[56:10] they actually they are not correct in
[56:13] their view and they are actually racist
[56:14] and evil i'm against that view
[56:16] you know but it's like if you go there
[56:17] you have to subscribe to all that you
[56:18] know it's
[56:19] but that's what's been happening right
[56:20] that's and it's playing out on the open
[56:22] stage it's not this is not a secret
[56:24] anymore
[56:24] and so this is the sort of thing that
[56:26] that these powers are
[56:27] and this is why people are kind of
[56:29] getting the message or they're
[56:31] engaging in this battle these are quotes
[56:33] that probably wouldn't get heard of
[56:35] 20 years ago 15 years ago but here's a
[56:37] here's a president of a country
[56:38] attacking another
[56:39] you know the guy that's going to try to
[56:41] take his job and he's saying
[56:43] mr trump who is invited himself as a
[56:45] presbyterian said of mr biden which is
[56:46] the
[56:47] you know you've got this right and left
[56:49] christian non-christian evil force and
[56:51] christian guys
[56:52] coming here to head so what does trump
[56:54] say he says this guy is going to take
[56:56] away your guns destroy a second
[56:57] amendment
[56:58] no religion hurt the bible hurt god
[57:01] he's against god he's against guns he's
[57:03] against energy our kind of energy
[57:05] so he's clearly saying that we've got
[57:06] this is an evil communist
[57:08] force you know we've got to rise up in
[57:10] the name of god and fight it
[57:12] you know and people are subscribing to
[57:13] this now this is not just a
[57:15] thing of our imagination this is
[57:16] happening right this is a real thing
[57:18] happening
[57:19] we can't say it doesn't because this is
[57:20] existing it's just it's in
[57:22] all sorts of places happening over here
[57:25] too who knows israel
[57:27] he's the he was the australian um rugby
[57:30] player
[57:31] he went he went um one time to express
[57:34] his opinion on facebook
[57:35] and this was his he's a christian guy um
[57:38] warning
[57:39] drunks homosexuals with a dollar is
[57:40] always fornicated saves atheists
[57:42] idolaters hallelujah repent only jesus
[57:44] saves
[57:44] lost his job with the australian rugby
[57:46] union but he he fought back and
[57:48] said no i'm not going to take this and
[57:50] i'm going to make a stand he fought back
[57:51] and got a massive payout from them
[57:53] right now now then he goes and plays for
[57:56] another team
[57:57] overseas and uh then they have this they
[57:59] all sort of take a knee at the
[58:01] at the start of the game and support a
[58:03] black lives matter but see he's now i'm
[58:05] against this whole communist evil force
[58:06] so i won't bow you know i'm a christian
[58:08] and
[58:09] now he's under attack again now
[58:12] see now these people are considered
[58:13] champions off this side now we've got to
[58:14] stand behind this guy you know so then
[58:16] you see all this
[58:17] stuff on social media support this guy
[58:18] you know stand with him you know we're
[58:20] going to fight back against this evil
[58:21] thing
[58:22] you know that's that's what they're all
[58:23] saying you know let's let's fight back
[58:24] against this communist organization
[58:26] you know and he becomes like a hero
[58:29] right
[58:29] don't get caught up in it i'm not going
[58:31] yeah let's fight back with him because
[58:32] we're not fighting against that
[58:33] organization
[58:34] we're not but this is not our fight but
[58:35] i just want to show you this is what's
[58:37] happening
[58:38] this is the world we live in and it's
[58:39] only going to get worse
[58:41] until rome finally rome will win in the
[58:42] end see these guys will start to
[58:44] actually win
[58:45] we now i'm not going to say we but the
[58:47] christian faith
[58:48] will actually start to win and they will
[58:50] eventually win for an hour
[58:52] and then and then and then russia will
[58:54] destroy rome
[58:55] you know that's what's going to happen
[58:56] so so that as dark as what it looks like
[58:59] people think i saw a quote the other day
[59:00] you know christianity america is dead
[59:02] i'm like you don't know what you're
[59:04] talking about
[59:05] christianity is going to win for a short
[59:06] amount of time you know
[59:08] all the dominations everyone's going to
[59:09] band together to fight this evil
[59:11] communist
[59:12] darkness and they're actually going to
[59:13] win and and people
[59:15] see courage like this they see cars like
[59:17] trump standing against they're like we
[59:18] can do this you know we can fight back
[59:19] christians do
[59:20] but don't get caught up in it i
[59:22] shouldn't but just to show just to show
[59:23] you what's actually happening like the
[59:25] the nba is a as a known really
[59:27] left-leaning unapologetic we hate
[59:28] conservatives we hate
[59:29] they're very pro-china you know they're
[59:31] just open about their beliefs
[59:33] and for years it's gone on okay but
[59:36] their viewership now is has dropped by
[59:38] fifty percent from like five million a
[59:39] game two and a half million a game
[59:41] and when you read the comments and this
[59:43] people are saying this because we don't
[59:44] support a communist organization that's
[59:45] trying to come in with all their
[59:46] left-wing ideas
[59:47] so people aren't watching so their
[59:49] ratings are going down by 50
[59:50] they're saying look if this was a sitcom
[59:53] they'd be cut you know
[59:54] right but this is about a fight this is
[59:57] not about a game this is about a fight
[59:59] of ideas
[1:00:00] that's what it is it's not it's that's
[1:00:01] what it's about it's not
[1:00:03] this is it just spews over in this you
[1:00:04] know spews over in different places
[1:00:06] spews over in hollywood spews over
[1:00:07] everywhere
[1:00:08] but the the the good guys are fighting
[1:00:11] back and they're supposedly winning like
[1:00:12] they're saying ha look at your
[1:00:13] organization
[1:00:14] now it's going down you know your
[1:00:15] viewership's down by 50 we're winning
[1:00:16] you know
[1:00:17] and when people win they start to get
[1:00:18] encouraged and that's what's starting to
[1:00:20] happen
[1:00:21] now i'm going to carry on with this pope
[1:00:23] john wants all the churches to come
[1:00:24] together to fight communism and god
[1:00:26] anybody that knows the bible knows
[1:00:27] god organized communism to kill her with
[1:00:29] whether it burn
[1:00:30] burn the [ __ ] that's rome and burn her
[1:00:32] children are bear to fire sure he's
[1:00:33] using it just like he did king
[1:00:34] nebuchadnezzar
[1:00:36] the protestant churches will unite
[1:00:37] themselves together and make a council
[1:00:38] of churches and pentecost write with
[1:00:40] them why they don't know the word that's
[1:00:41] exactly the words promising that they're
[1:00:42] going to unite together to fight
[1:00:43] communism this evil force that's coming
[1:00:45] on the world
[1:00:46] and that's exactly what's happening
[1:00:48] right and finally will unite this
[1:00:50] brotherhood not come out as catholic and
[1:00:51] they'll be united as a brotherhood to
[1:00:53] try and stamp out communism
[1:00:54] the evil left you know okay
[1:00:57] yeah oh what did i do there
[1:01:01] okay into new zealand so we've got our
[1:01:04] own fight brewing on our hands right
[1:01:06] well i don't because i'm not fighting
[1:01:08] this thing you know i'm not fighting
[1:01:09] this whole i'm not into this whole cause
[1:01:10] but
[1:01:10] we've got something we we have so this
[1:01:13] is our prime minister
[1:01:14] and i think she's actually a very strong
[1:01:16] lady i think she's you know in terms of
[1:01:18] um i was saying to shannon the other day
[1:01:21] like in terms of
[1:01:23] she's she must be going through a lot of
[1:01:24] troubles and then she has to come out
[1:01:25] and she talks like she's not you know
[1:01:26] she's a very strong lady i've got a lot
[1:01:28] of
[1:01:28] admiration for her ability to she's done
[1:01:30] well in her career
[1:01:32] let's say that she's done very very well
[1:01:33] you know and you've got to acknowledge
[1:01:34] people that have done well
[1:01:35] i think she's very intelligent she's
[1:01:36] done very well um
[1:01:40] so this this group here is called the
[1:01:42] international union of socialist youth
[1:01:44] it's mainly from all the left-leaning
[1:01:46] parties around the western world in
[1:01:47] south africa and different ones are all
[1:01:48] part of this group and they
[1:01:50] each year they have different presidents
[1:01:51] of this international union of socialist
[1:01:54] youth which goes way back they had a bit
[1:01:55] of a spat with communism and they kind
[1:01:56] of split up
[1:01:57] in the earlier days but they're still
[1:01:59] that sort of way you know
[1:02:00] and the president of that in 2008 was
[1:02:03] jacinda ardern before she came back here
[1:02:04] and became
[1:02:05] our prime minister right so now that the
[1:02:07] the good guys see this and go oh hang on
[1:02:09] these like the socialists coming in and
[1:02:11] right that's that's and that and
[1:02:15] like i said socialism and communism they
[1:02:17] they're all they're good they're very
[1:02:18] good principals
[1:02:19] but they always seem to come with this
[1:02:20] godless idea like we don't need god you
[1:02:22] know
[1:02:22] so that's kind of has to you almost
[1:02:25] can't be it
[1:02:26] unless you have that belief you can but
[1:02:28] it's it's pushed the
[1:02:29] narrative is pushed that way and that's
[1:02:31] that's why it's becoming toxic
[1:02:33] to be involved in anything very toxic
[1:02:36] everything is toxic every every new
[1:02:38] avenue is toxic i'm not involved in any
[1:02:39] of it anymore because it's way too toxic
[1:02:41] it's just for a believer but a believer
[1:02:43] is not fighting there anyways i'll show
[1:02:45] you in a little bit right
[1:02:46] now i want to say this because this is
[1:02:48] the world we live in this is the world
[1:02:50] we live in and this is what we face and
[1:02:51] this is what our minds have to
[1:02:53] comprehend on a daily basis this is us
[1:02:55] people and this and it's only going to
[1:02:57] get worse
[1:02:58] it's only going to get worse right so
[1:03:00] now we're bringing this whole current
[1:03:02] affair right there's this
[1:03:03] cover 19 thing now this this has got
[1:03:05] that con
[1:03:06] i wouldn't say a conspiracy theorist i'd
[1:03:07] say the guys that are trying to fight
[1:03:08] against communism and all that stuff
[1:03:10] that this has got them like
[1:03:11] they've they're running red hot you know
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:14] right and and and they've got they've
[1:03:17] got cause too they look at the
[1:03:18] socialists you know she was she's
[1:03:20] she was a socialist coming in now she's
[1:03:21] running the country and so should this
[1:03:22] like
[1:03:23] distribution of wealth you know like to
[1:03:25] cinder's argument for the the last
[1:03:26] financial crisis was how we're going to
[1:03:28] fix it all we just redistribute all the
[1:03:29] wealth and then we'll solve all the
[1:03:30] problems you know
[1:03:31] but that's the common which probably
[1:03:34] might work but
[1:03:36] now i just want to show you this until
[1:03:38] it all runs out
[1:03:39] jersey forecast show that it's
[1:03:40] definitely not the case they show
[1:03:42] net new borrowing of 100 this is new
[1:03:43] zealand's finances now 163 billion over
[1:03:46] the next five years
[1:03:47] and so they're saying eventually our
[1:03:51] deficit is going to get to 200 billion
[1:03:53] now 11 months ago they're saying it was
[1:03:54] 60 billion so and
[1:03:55] in the space of about four years we're
[1:03:56] going to go from 60 billion of debt to
[1:03:58] 200 billion that's a massive jump that's
[1:04:01] like 300 or something in the space of
[1:04:02] four years they're like
[1:04:03] oh hang on hang on this is huge what's
[1:04:05] going on here this is like
[1:04:06] this is unheard of and unheard of
[1:04:09] escalation of debt what's going on
[1:04:10] there's some sort of conspiracy
[1:04:11] you're trying to ruin the country you
[1:04:13] know which which could be the intention
[1:04:15] who knows it may be okay now
[1:04:19] all this means that a forecast borrowing
[1:04:21] now they're saying there's no problem
[1:04:22] with it though because the rates the
[1:04:23] interest rates on this
[1:04:24] 1060 billion are low they're they're at
[1:04:26] two percent you know for the next
[1:04:27] 10 years so even in 10 years time we're
[1:04:29] only going to be we're not going to be
[1:04:30] paying a lot more than what we're paying
[1:04:31] now because the interest rates have come
[1:04:32] down
[1:04:33] even though the borrowing's gone up the
[1:04:34] interest rates have come down so we're
[1:04:35] paying three billion now and ten years
[1:04:36] will only be paying four billion you
[1:04:38] know
[1:04:38] rest rest easy everybody never mind the
[1:04:41] fact they're still trying to bill you
[1:04:42] know it doesn't matter
[1:04:43] the interest rates are going to be low
[1:04:44] you know it's that's
[1:04:46] you know so their treasury is always
[1:04:48] easily sustainable you know if it's like
[1:04:49] we haven't talked about paying it back
[1:04:50] yet have we gonna
[1:04:51] do that but i guess it doesn't matter so
[1:04:54] then this is the next thing so who will
[1:04:55] lend us the money this is the article
[1:04:57] who will lend us where we're going to
[1:04:58] get this money from let me read this to
[1:05:01] you then there's also demand from our
[1:05:02] own reserve bank for those bonds
[1:05:03] government bonds it has just doubled its
[1:05:05] appetite to 60 billion inside two months
[1:05:07] and as said it will borrow up to be able
[1:05:09] to borrow up to 50 of government bonds
[1:05:11] on issue this implies that the reserve
[1:05:12] bank still has room to increase its
[1:05:13] quantitative easing program by another
[1:05:15] 40 billion to at least 100 billion
[1:05:17] they believe only 40 billion to be lent
[1:05:19] by overseas and local investors let me
[1:05:20] to explain to you what that means
[1:05:22] we're going to print money we're going
[1:05:24] to print money like
[1:05:26] and it's cleverly worded like there's
[1:05:27] demand from the reserve bank
[1:05:29] you meet them what are they getting for
[1:05:30] their buck they're just oh look we
[1:05:31] decided we're going to print some money
[1:05:33] and buy some of your
[1:05:33] bonds you know you give us an iu we'll
[1:05:35] give you the money you know and where
[1:05:37] that demand came from i don't know like
[1:05:39] we don't need it we're not getting
[1:05:40] anything for our money we're going to
[1:05:42] print money and you know
[1:05:43] there's demand there's no demand it's
[1:05:46] like
[1:05:46] we're just going to print money and
[1:05:48] we're going to print we're going to
[1:05:49] print 100 billion because quantitative
[1:05:51] easing means i'm going to print money
[1:05:52] and lend it to you
[1:05:53] that's what it means right they're just
[1:05:54] that's that's that's the it's
[1:05:56] that's a flash word for and we all know
[1:05:58] that does it creates inflation and makes
[1:06:00] your dollar worth less and
[1:06:01] all the rest of it right cares don't
[1:06:04] worry about it it's just what's
[1:06:05] happening there
[1:06:06] don't get all stressed bring it on print
[1:06:09] some more
[1:06:11] throw it out there you know yeah
[1:06:14] the younger generations of voters are
[1:06:16] entering a world see if i was
[1:06:18] of this camp i'd be like we've got to
[1:06:20] fight this because they're ruining the
[1:06:21] country they're ruining our god society
[1:06:22] and you know
[1:06:23] ruin it who cares it's gone it's not our
[1:06:27] fight
[1:06:27] it's gone it's done we've got another
[1:06:29] fight we're doing
[1:06:31] and it's to find the bride of christ
[1:06:34] okay
[1:06:34] the younger generation of voters are
[1:06:35] entering a world their parents would not
[1:06:37] recognize
[1:06:37] debt is one worry that they can relegate
[1:06:40] behind others
[1:06:41] including housing affordability climate
[1:06:43] change geopolitical tension in their own
[1:06:45] households
[1:06:46] and then i've got all this debt it's
[1:06:47] that it's no big deal you know we as
[1:06:48] long as we've gonna afford a house
[1:06:50] you want to be buying a house if your
[1:06:52] country's bus but anyway but anyway you
[1:06:54] know what i'm saying it's like oh it's
[1:06:55] no big deal
[1:06:55] and i just found some funny right here
[1:06:58] now but there are people that are saying
[1:06:59] we don't like what's going on and this
[1:07:00] is ordinary new zealanders are starting
[1:07:02] to
[1:07:02] wake up right that these are people that
[1:07:06] have had sort of christian upbringing or
[1:07:07] just
[1:07:08] uh that way inclined they're they're
[1:07:10] kind of going well hang on what's going
[1:07:11] on here like
[1:07:12] different it's coming on now like a same
[1:07:14] as what's happening in america it's the
[1:07:15] force is sort of rising up
[1:07:17] awakening you know by imposing this is
[1:07:20] an
[1:07:20] article in the otago daily times by
[1:07:22] imposing lockdown restrictions that were
[1:07:23] far tighter than they needed to be
[1:07:24] jacinda arden has brought the country to
[1:07:26] its knees now through generous subsidies
[1:07:28] even the private sector is becoming a
[1:07:29] state beneficiary
[1:07:30] into me thank you anymore
[1:07:34] there's no doubt about it our prime
[1:07:35] minister is again leading the world with
[1:07:36] bold measures this time it's not global
[1:07:38] warming or nuclear free
[1:07:39] moment not closing down the oil and gas
[1:07:40] exploration industry it's a much more
[1:07:42] fundamental and potentially far more
[1:07:43] destructive
[1:07:44] just in the arduino's transform new
[1:07:45] zealand into a socialist state
[1:07:47] and the tragedy is that most people are
[1:07:49] completely unaware that it's happening
[1:07:51] right socialist communists are there
[1:07:52] saying this big evil thing is coming in
[1:07:54] we've got to stand up and fight again so
[1:07:55] that's what's going on right
[1:07:57] and this i thought this was an
[1:07:58] interesting thing how new zealand
[1:07:59] learned to stop worrying and love
[1:08:00] government debt
[1:08:01] you know here's our treasure with us you
[1:08:03] know sitting in a pool of money you know
[1:08:05] just
[1:08:05] throwing it out there there's been a bad
[1:08:07] word in wellington for decades all of a
[1:08:09] sudden the government has planned to
[1:08:10] spend billions of dollars we don't have
[1:08:11] because of covert 19.
[1:08:13] um then then justice says justin looks
[1:08:15] at the new appetite on debt and how it
[1:08:17] compares with the rest of the world so
[1:08:18] they're saying well we don't really care
[1:08:20] anymore just yet borrow money and give
[1:08:21] us some cash right
[1:08:24] so i just want to talk about this so so
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:27] in new zealand we have certain laws i
[1:08:28] want to talk about the lockdown real
[1:08:29] quick but and it was um
[1:08:31] the the on the last lockdown that we had
[1:08:34] it was um i often wondered if it was
[1:08:36] legal because i thought that's kind of
[1:08:37] strange i don't think you can just put
[1:08:38] people in their houses and lock them
[1:08:39] away it's a little bit
[1:08:40] funny right so and and that is also
[1:08:42] getting the conspiracy guys and the
[1:08:43] the good godly rights fighting this
[1:08:46] thing to
[1:08:46] like well hang on hang on you can't lock
[1:08:47] us up you know it's against my rights
[1:08:49] and this evil thing is trying to lock me
[1:08:50] down
[1:08:50] turn us into a communist country you
[1:08:52] know they're all up in arms at it
[1:08:54] you know which there is there is truth
[1:08:55] to it because it is going to be a war
[1:08:57] that is happening because brotherhood
[1:08:58] said it would happen so there is truth
[1:08:59] to it i just want to make light of it
[1:09:00] because i don't want to make it like
[1:09:02] i'm a part of this mess you know and i'm
[1:09:03] fighting trying to fight for this
[1:09:04] because i'm not
[1:09:05] right but back then they had to we have
[1:09:08] what they call a
[1:09:09] civil defense emergency act so
[1:09:12] so and we have certain laws you know
[1:09:15] that we are certain rights are protected
[1:09:16] on a daily basis but when there's a
[1:09:19] winner either a mayor of a town of an
[1:09:22] area or the
[1:09:23] the government can declare either a
[1:09:25] state of local emergency or a state of
[1:09:26] national emergency
[1:09:27] and when that happens then there's
[1:09:28] different laws they enact a different
[1:09:30] set of laws that apply within that
[1:09:31] period of time and i think these are
[1:09:32] generally two weeks they can go on for
[1:09:34] seven days and they have to declare
[1:09:35] another one so they officially have to
[1:09:36] say i declare a state of emergency and
[1:09:37] then
[1:09:38] and then and there are different laws
[1:09:39] within that like there are sort of
[1:09:41] health laws and things within that that
[1:09:42] they can enact
[1:09:43] essentially it kind of they can sort of
[1:09:46] make their own rules up you know they
[1:09:47] can close roads off and things that they
[1:09:48] wouldn't otherwise be able to do i'll
[1:09:49] put this one in there because i thought
[1:09:50] it was quite funny that
[1:09:51] you know if there if if there's an area
[1:09:53] that's declared to be a state of local
[1:09:55] emergency or
[1:09:56] national emergency and there's a vehicle
[1:09:57] there or a boat or anything like your
[1:09:59] car sitting there they can just
[1:10:00] break into your car and take it and use
[1:10:02] it for the cause that they want to use
[1:10:03] it for you know
[1:10:04] so but the idea is fine you know hey
[1:10:06] look we're it's a time of trouble we
[1:10:07] need to
[1:10:08] your cars there we needed your diggers
[1:10:09] there your boats there we needed it to
[1:10:11] help the cause you know
[1:10:12] it's fine that's just the way that these
[1:10:14] things work right but but
[1:10:16] i think people were researching it and
[1:10:17] thinking actually you don't have the
[1:10:18] right to lock us down like hey you did
[1:10:19] you know you can't lock us away
[1:10:21] fighting back at this evil thing you
[1:10:22] know so then
[1:10:24] so then as a result quickly when
[1:10:26] everyone was locked away i think the
[1:10:27] government
[1:10:27] realizing we've kind of we may have we
[1:10:29] may get in a wee bit of a pickle here
[1:10:32] we may that because legal forces were
[1:10:34] sort of coming against them to say
[1:10:36] you can't lock us down you know that so
[1:10:37] they had to quickly enact another law to
[1:10:39] make it like
[1:10:40] you know russia law through right to
[1:10:41] make it's okay we can now we can lock
[1:10:42] you down
[1:10:43] they kind of had to they were on the
[1:10:44] back foot a bit because it because even
[1:10:46] during the time of lockdown the police
[1:10:47] didn't know what they're like well can
[1:10:48] we tell people to go home can we
[1:10:49] you probably could have just walked
[1:10:50] around and said no you can't show me
[1:10:52] what law there is to you know what i
[1:10:54] mean
[1:10:54] you could have gotten away with it
[1:10:55] because they didn't even know what their
[1:10:56] rights were and what they could do right
[1:10:57] there was
[1:10:58] it was all so they quickly rushed this
[1:10:59] law through you know which
[1:11:01] but hey it is what it is but this really
[1:11:04] gets the conspiracy theorists in there
[1:11:05] well not the complete the right you know
[1:11:07] the
[1:11:07] the god god you know it gets them all
[1:11:10] going
[1:11:10] because this law this this is the order
[1:11:13] now this is this is essentially not a
[1:11:15] laughing matter when you look at what it
[1:11:16] says
[1:11:17] right because it's people around the
[1:11:18] world are going what's going on in that
[1:11:19] country you guys are like look like a
[1:11:21] communist country now
[1:11:22] and so it's basically saying here's
[1:11:23] here's this law and the minister or
[1:11:26] the director general can can say say
[1:11:29] within the god framework of this law
[1:11:30] that this is what's going to happen
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:32] i want to just you guys read this one
[1:11:34] okay i'll read this is the law you're
[1:11:36] under right now because this law is
[1:11:37] enforced for two years and it's got to
[1:11:38] be renewed every three months but it's
[1:11:39] for two years this law is now in force
[1:11:42] right this is what we're looking at so
[1:11:43] so they can order you they can say
[1:11:45] uh anyone here rimpo you must stay at
[1:11:47] any specified place or retain from going
[1:11:50] to any specified place you you you
[1:11:52] either stay there we don't go there they
[1:11:53] can
[1:11:54] when they say that you legally have to
[1:11:56] stay there you can't go there
[1:11:57] you'll be a law breaker if you do that
[1:11:59] right you've got to refrain from
[1:12:01] association with specific persons you
[1:12:02] can't see andy
[1:12:03] in the story right stay physically
[1:12:05] distant from any person in any specified
[1:12:07] way they can tell you this
[1:12:08] refrain from traveling to or from any
[1:12:10] specified area aucklanders you can't go
[1:12:12] to wellington that's why now they can
[1:12:13] have police roadblocks because it's now
[1:12:14] a law because that
[1:12:15] what's happening now this this latest
[1:12:16] one is under this law so the police can
[1:12:18] stop and say where you're going oh i'm
[1:12:19] going to
[1:12:20] commend up to my batch no you're not you
[1:12:22] you and this region had to stay here so
[1:12:24] we can arrest you if you don't turn
[1:12:25] around and go back that's the law now
[1:12:26] they and then the police know they've
[1:12:28] got this power right
[1:12:29] retain from carrying out specific
[1:12:31] activities because this is one that got
[1:12:32] the other got them
[1:12:33] mixed up last time for example business
[1:12:34] activities involving close personnel
[1:12:36] contact will require specific activity
[1:12:38] to be carried out
[1:12:39] only in any specified way or compliance
[1:12:41] with specified measures like oh you've
[1:12:42] got to stop you stop your business
[1:12:43] you know there was really no real law in
[1:12:45] the last one to do that so we could have
[1:12:47] still operated
[1:12:48] just looked bad well i don't know that
[1:12:50] for a fact but you know it's it's
[1:12:52] sort of like that be isolated or
[1:12:53] quarantined in any specified place or
[1:12:55] any specified way
[1:12:57] just refrain from participating in
[1:13:01] gatherings of any specified kind in any
[1:13:03] specified
[1:13:04] place or any or in any or specified
[1:13:06] circumstances you know
[1:13:08] now this is the one that gets people
[1:13:10] right report for an undergo a medical
[1:13:12] examination or testing of any kind
[1:13:15] and at any place or time specified and
[1:13:17] in any
[1:13:18] specified way or specified circumstances
[1:13:22] that means now let me explain to you
[1:13:23] what what that means is that means
[1:13:26] they can walk into your house at any
[1:13:27] time of the day not they're saying we
[1:13:28] won't do that but this is what the law
[1:13:30] implies can be done walk into your house
[1:13:32] at any time of the day and i am forced
[1:13:33] you to have this medical test and
[1:13:35] and that's law and if you don't we can
[1:13:36] arrest you for breaking the law right
[1:13:39] um so that's pretty intense you know now
[1:13:42] if you're if you're against this evil
[1:13:43] communist thing you go man are we living
[1:13:45] in china or something are we living in
[1:13:46] russia you know
[1:13:47] police state is that what we've come to
[1:13:48] because these are right
[1:13:50] bring it on provide and specify
[1:13:53] circumstances or any specified way any
[1:13:55] information necessary to the purpose of
[1:13:56] contract tracing
[1:13:57] right so that's this is what's happening
[1:13:59] in our country too it's it's this
[1:14:01] it's this evil force of socialist
[1:14:02] communism coming in and you know like
[1:14:05] destroying our liberties into now the
[1:14:06] champions of the
[1:14:08] you know you know enter the savior
[1:14:11] that's going to come in and fight
[1:14:12] against us you know so political parties
[1:14:13] are rising up now
[1:14:14] we've got our own if you want to join
[1:14:16] you can join and fight this evil thing
[1:14:18] right
[1:14:18] it's not just in america not just in the
[1:14:20] uk in europe it's here as well we
[1:14:23] you know we can do this and it inspires
[1:14:25] us we're like yeah i love this country
[1:14:26] i'm going to fight back against this you
[1:14:27] know but
[1:14:28] be very careful don't get involved in it
[1:14:30] well that's just my
[1:14:32] opinion that's what i've chosen to do
[1:14:34] because this is not my fight right
[1:14:35] but there's a party called the advanced
[1:14:37] new zealand party or the nzpp there's
[1:14:39] two parties that are combined and
[1:14:40] there's a few guys on this but these
[1:14:41] guys seem to have gotten the most
[1:14:42] traction
[1:14:43] and they they come in and said we are
[1:14:44] against this we know what's happening
[1:14:46] you know it was it was run the advanced
[1:14:49] party is this guy um
[1:14:50] he's jamie lee ross he's actually
[1:14:52] sitting in p so he's in parliament at
[1:14:54] the moment fighting against all this
[1:14:55] stuff and
[1:14:56] and he had the um and his that another
[1:14:59] party called
[1:15:00] um the new zealand public party which
[1:15:02] was this guy billy taka christian guy
[1:15:04] very nice guy very very cool guy you
[1:15:06] know very cool very like
[1:15:08] very personable like he he would be a
[1:15:10] great guy to everyone he's a very nice
[1:15:11] guy
[1:15:11] but he's vehemently against this
[1:15:13] communist evil regime coming in and
[1:15:15] and he's fighting back hard you know
[1:15:17] these guys are fighting back and they're
[1:15:18] saying don't worry people we're going to
[1:15:19] be calm we're going to fight back at
[1:15:20] this thing
[1:15:21] and they're getting traction like
[1:15:22] wouldn't believe around the country
[1:15:23] their numbers are just growing and
[1:15:24] growing and growing people like yeah man
[1:15:25] let's fight back at this thing
[1:15:27] now you know there's some of his quotes
[1:15:29] secured everyone well democracy just
[1:15:31] suffered another punch in the stomach
[1:15:32] with the delay of elections and i'm
[1:15:33] deeply concerned that this government is
[1:15:34] going to continue its assault on our
[1:15:35] freedoms
[1:15:36] and our economy you know he's saying
[1:15:38] they're saying all the right things
[1:15:39] um here we knew this lockdown was
[1:15:41] planned and we announced it exactly one
[1:15:42] month before it happened like the august
[1:15:44] one we're saying they said look we've
[1:15:45] got government
[1:15:45] we've got information from our sources
[1:15:47] that there's going to be a lockdown and
[1:15:48] the second week of august people have
[1:15:49] told us it's going to happen get ready
[1:15:50] they're planning for it it's going to
[1:15:51] happen
[1:15:52] second week of august there was a
[1:15:53] lockdown right they're saying we told
[1:15:54] you so we
[1:15:55] this is a conspiracy there's this evil
[1:15:57] force coming on you know
[1:15:58] people are well we've got to fight back
[1:15:59] against us you know so these guys are
[1:16:01] gaining a lot of traction
[1:16:03] um now when the when the two-day
[1:16:06] lockdown was like was enforced now
[1:16:08] saying what they're going to do next
[1:16:10] these guys said right we're going to
[1:16:11] protest in the streets we're going to
[1:16:12] fight back at this we can't let this
[1:16:14] happen
[1:16:14] and this is just me but i believe some
[1:16:16] of their movement actually
[1:16:18] i think because conspiracy theories
[1:16:20] suddenly started to get a lot of
[1:16:21] traction in the
[1:16:22] social media and even mainstream news
[1:16:24] people were trying to fight back
[1:16:26] i could be wrong in this but i think
[1:16:27] these sort of protests actually stopped
[1:16:29] there from being a worse lockdown than
[1:16:30] what there was because this was gaining
[1:16:31] a lot of momentum and people aren't
[1:16:33] not aware of this stuff and they were
[1:16:34] like oh actually and a lot of it was
[1:16:36] from the indigenous from the maori
[1:16:37] people and they were fighting back
[1:16:38] saying no way no no
[1:16:39] right so so these did have an effect
[1:16:41] right this this actually pushed
[1:16:42] i think it pushed it back because they
[1:16:44] were like well there's a big force
[1:16:45] rising up like
[1:16:46] we probably can't just easily do this
[1:16:47] one because these guys were getting a
[1:16:49] lot of traction
[1:16:50] that doesn't mean he's doing it i'm not
[1:16:52] yeah i'm just saying this is what this
[1:16:54] is what's happening in our country right
[1:16:55] and here's some of their policies i'm
[1:16:56] going to move on shortly
[1:16:58] some of their policies we will fully
[1:17:00] investigate and remove any and all
[1:17:02] united nations u.n agenda and agreements
[1:17:04] from new zealand government and society
[1:17:06] if they do not serve the people of new
[1:17:07] zealand because they're saying there's
[1:17:08] all these agendas from this global
[1:17:09] communist body that have come in and
[1:17:11] putting agendas on us we're going to
[1:17:12] remove all those right
[1:17:14] and he's saying the chinese communist
[1:17:15] party has been fully implicated in
[1:17:17] funding new zealand's main political
[1:17:18] parties labour and national we're gonna
[1:17:19] we're gonna look into that if we get
[1:17:21] into power and find out where is this
[1:17:22] communist money going and what's it
[1:17:23] backing and why they're doing all this
[1:17:24] you know
[1:17:25] so they're aware of you know starting to
[1:17:27] see and people are waking up you know oh
[1:17:29] yeah let's
[1:17:30] you understand what i'm saying it's it's
[1:17:32] everywhere this is
[1:17:35] this is i just threw this in there
[1:17:36] because i just thought i would in new
[1:17:38] zealand too they've been trying to now
[1:17:39] divide the politics left and right as
[1:17:41] well into you know the
[1:17:42] left-wing godless kind of groups and
[1:17:45] then the
[1:17:45] right-wing christian you know they're
[1:17:47] trying to and racist all sort of that's
[1:17:48] what they're trying to
[1:17:49] do right in the end they've tried to do
[1:17:51] it with the national leader
[1:17:53] to get to put her in that camp because
[1:17:56] you know she'll come out and say things
[1:17:57] like oh does it matter that i'm white
[1:17:58] you know and i look that proof she's
[1:17:59] like that but
[1:18:00] i'm just saying this because this is
[1:18:01] what we we face right but they her
[1:18:03] narrative is slightly harder to get
[1:18:04] across because this is her um
[1:18:06] her high school sweetheart to be married
[1:18:07] to forever you know
[1:18:09] and that's their family so to call her
[1:18:11] you know this is what you're like is
[1:18:12] this
[1:18:13] it's but if there were other people in
[1:18:15] in power that
[1:18:16] you know that's the way this country's
[1:18:17] going as well okay so
[1:18:20] now i'm i'm gonna go back onto this now
[1:18:23] we'll never do any good with politics
[1:18:24] this is what i think about this whole
[1:18:25] thing too
[1:18:26] it's rotten god's idea of having a king
[1:18:28] a righteous king is right but politics
[1:18:30] simply spread out you
[1:18:31] you can buy anything out cheat lie steal
[1:18:33] everything else and i said a few sundays
[1:18:34] ago and look where you're at see
[1:18:36] nothing but just a crooked mess of
[1:18:37] everything but a righteous king can make
[1:18:39] his own laws and you can you can kill a
[1:18:41] man like saying
[1:18:41] and if you know good politics or
[1:18:43] politicians that's all right you'll get
[1:18:44] out of it see
[1:18:46] what he's saying is god's way was having
[1:18:47] a righteous king that was balanced that
[1:18:49] his views went from there to there
[1:18:51] and he had a balanced view and he would
[1:18:52] he would apply the right opinion in the
[1:18:54] right situation i'll apply this
[1:18:56] view this left view to that situation
[1:18:58] because right below apply this view to
[1:18:59] that situation
[1:19:00] he was balanced now that that's actually
[1:19:02] that's that's what he's
[1:19:04] that's what is the actual ideal way of
[1:19:06] god doing it of course that's not going
[1:19:07] to happen
[1:19:08] because people are scared of one person
[1:19:10] ruling inhabit but a righteous king is
[1:19:12] is an ideal scenario because he's he's
[1:19:14] all things right
[1:19:17] the democracy is a good idea but it
[1:19:18] won't work just like communism all
[1:19:20] things are common it sounds good but it
[1:19:21] won't work no the god's way of having a
[1:19:23] king like king david was was right
[1:19:25] and you've got one mind centered over it
[1:19:27] you know balance the view
[1:19:29] over it like one leader and a bunch of
[1:19:30] geese and so forth you can
[1:19:32] you can't take two or three of them you
[1:19:36] then you miss them all together and you
[1:19:37] come up with any kind of idea you know
[1:19:38] you it
[1:19:40] which is what we've got now i want to
[1:19:41] start talking about where we we fit in
[1:19:43] this now we see this uniting time coming
[1:19:46] now watch when the church has united
[1:19:48] itself
[1:19:49] against the message and then when it
[1:19:52] does that
[1:19:53] the nations are uniting themselves
[1:19:55] against communism to destroy the church
[1:19:56] again
[1:19:57] just exactly what it did in the first
[1:19:58] place see it repeats itself right again
[1:20:00] israel had to turn down the message
[1:20:02] first and when they turned down the
[1:20:04] message then the military the national
[1:20:06] life
[1:20:06] itself united together of the other
[1:20:08] nations and come in and destroyed the
[1:20:10] church
[1:20:10] and today they've turned down the
[1:20:12] message of the lord jesus and they've
[1:20:13] turned it down and now the time has come
[1:20:15] to where communism is uniting the world
[1:20:17] together
[1:20:17] against the church see it has to be that
[1:20:19] way now it's hard to say that
[1:20:22] okay it was hard for them jews to
[1:20:24] believe they said now come brethren we
[1:20:25] see that our god is with us
[1:20:27] and i'll talk to this in a bit so we're
[1:20:29] going to the temple this is when titus
[1:20:31] was coming against
[1:20:32] them after they finished rejecting the
[1:20:34] word
[1:20:35] then then then this evil came upon them
[1:20:39] and they thought now god you're going to
[1:20:40] deliver us
[1:20:40] right and it's the same thing's
[1:20:42] happening today our god is with us we've
[1:20:44] gone to the temple and now we will pray
[1:20:46] and let the holy father so and so and
[1:20:47] holy father so-and-so lead in prayer
[1:20:49] close the gate you know we'll fight and
[1:20:51] titus took a stand and still right there
[1:20:52] for about a year or more
[1:20:53] see right on guard and starve them right
[1:20:55] out there couldn't be a one of them even
[1:20:57] get outside the city and they died
[1:20:58] starved and when he went in there
[1:21:00] and tore down walls down and blood
[1:21:02] gushed out and run like rivers down
[1:21:03] there we slaughtered everything that was
[1:21:05] in there
[1:21:06] that was the eventual end of then once
[1:21:08] they turned away the word and they tried
[1:21:10] to
[1:21:11] fight but now the followers of christ
[1:21:15] of the lord jesus that were actually in
[1:21:16] there they said when you see the armies
[1:21:18] encompassed around jerusalem
[1:21:20] flee get out flee so so
[1:21:23] titus pulled back i think because it was
[1:21:25] winter and they and they said
[1:21:26] this you're fighting a losing fight we
[1:21:28] got told to flee so they fled right now
[1:21:30] we've been told the same thing
[1:21:32] flee get out of it right so
[1:21:35] just to put it in like a graphical term
[1:21:37] so because this is what i'm saying
[1:21:39] to picture this is where we as bride fit
[1:21:42] into this equation
[1:21:44] because what happened there is exactly
[1:21:45] what's happening today it's now front
[1:21:47] page news you know it's all around us
[1:21:50] in that time you had the you know you
[1:21:51] had the the pharisees
[1:21:54] essentially jesus came to the jews which
[1:21:55] were mixed you know the pharisees and
[1:21:57] then everyone was mixed in there and
[1:21:59] i've got divided into three people that
[1:22:01] unbelievers make believers and true
[1:22:03] believers which essentially
[1:22:04] the three that you got on you know in
[1:22:05] this case the romans that that force
[1:22:07] were the
[1:22:07] unbelievers although they were you know
[1:22:09] just in type they were they were
[1:22:10] believers come out but you know
[1:22:12] as a force the pharisees in that line
[1:22:14] were the make believers and the
[1:22:16] the disciples the ones that the lord was
[1:22:18] calling out the true believers so so
[1:22:19] the word came in and ministered you know
[1:22:22] and and
[1:22:23] then the first thing that had to happen
[1:22:25] was you know that's the lord coming out
[1:22:26] and preaching the word coming
[1:22:28] and and the first thing the uniting had
[1:22:30] to happen from the
[1:22:31] the make believers had to unite first
[1:22:33] against christ and against all of his
[1:22:34] followers to
[1:22:35] to get him out you know if he comes into
[1:22:37] your synagogue and preaches
[1:22:39] you're not welcome you know we're gonna
[1:22:40] we're gonna kick you out of the
[1:22:41] organization and so they united first
[1:22:43] because we're talking about now uniting
[1:22:44] they're united first against christ and
[1:22:46] any of his followers you know
[1:22:47] who who's this man you know were you
[1:22:49] born blind you know
[1:22:51] they told them the truth then they beat
[1:22:52] him you know they they're they're
[1:22:54] against
[1:22:55] this so the first thing they had to do
[1:22:56] was unite against
[1:22:58] the word against christ and against his
[1:23:00] followers so they did and they they
[1:23:01] pushed them out
[1:23:02] and then see that's this is what
[1:23:05] happened in that time
[1:23:07] and then then after that the unbelievers
[1:23:09] the romans then
[1:23:10] united against the against the church
[1:23:14] against the not the church but the they
[1:23:16] make believers right that's what
[1:23:17] happened next
[1:23:18] and now when they saw that coming on
[1:23:20] they then all united together to fight
[1:23:22] back against it
[1:23:23] right that was the type and and
[1:23:27] now eventually they they were totally
[1:23:29] destroyed
[1:23:31] which rome will be totally destroyed by
[1:23:32] communism by russia is gonna
[1:23:34] and one day your destruction will come
[1:23:35] that's that's what's been prophesied in
[1:23:37] this whole
[1:23:37] this whole movement it's gonna be it's
[1:23:39] gonna it's a win for an hour but it's
[1:23:41] gonna
[1:23:41] all be done away with right all around
[1:23:44] the world
[1:23:45] just wanna read this all around the
[1:23:46] world i guess you know what i mean then
[1:23:49] everywhere why did you turn me down in
[1:23:50] switzerland why did you do it finland
[1:23:52] the blood's going to be upon your hands
[1:23:53] that's upon you not me you never turned
[1:23:55] me down
[1:23:55] you turned him down not me because he
[1:23:57] said i don't believe in such the words
[1:23:58] say such there you are blind pharisee
[1:24:00] they can discern communism to send all
[1:24:02] these things
[1:24:02] but the hour they're living and they
[1:24:04] can't discern that's exactly right
[1:24:06] now this is what happened in this time
[1:24:08] when the spirit falls they become
[1:24:10] and there becomes a move amongst the
[1:24:11] people them denominations will swing
[1:24:12] together just as certain as i'm standing
[1:24:14] in this pulpit and the church of god
[1:24:15] will be ousted that's the bride
[1:24:16] and they'll make such a racket until
[1:24:18] their confederate and put a boycott on
[1:24:20] anybody who don't belong to them
[1:24:21] rome will rule the world for just an
[1:24:23] hour she'll rule for a little peace not
[1:24:25] communism
[1:24:26] rome will room will rule the world with
[1:24:28] the cooperation of protestantism
[1:24:30] and a denominational form of church
[1:24:32] which god has rejected that's as close
[1:24:33] to the word of god
[1:24:34] as i know so that's what's on the um if
[1:24:37] you want to read the script that's
[1:24:38] what's going to happen
[1:24:39] don't think this evil communist is going
[1:24:40] to win in this battle
[1:24:43] rome is going to win this whole fight
[1:24:44] that's happening rome is going to win
[1:24:45] and
[1:24:46] you'll see it play out before you right
[1:24:48] and the bible says she'll come up like a
[1:24:50] lamb freedom of religion two little
[1:24:51] horns civil and ecclesiastical and after
[1:24:52] a while they united and spoke like the
[1:24:54] dragon did
[1:24:55] and done everything the dragon did
[1:24:56] before him and the bible said they made
[1:24:58] an image unto the beast the
[1:24:59] confederation of church
[1:25:00] just what they got in right now here in
[1:25:02] new york city and and there they
[1:25:04] the great big morgue up there so he
[1:25:05] calls it a morg all you baptist
[1:25:07] or methodist baptist and pentecostals
[1:25:08] and every one of you economical uh
[1:25:11] economical people out there trying to do
[1:25:12] such things as that and selling out your
[1:25:14] birthrights like joining up with
[1:25:15] the catholics to fight the communists to
[1:25:17] join that bunch of babylon what's the
[1:25:19] matter with you sure selling your birth
[1:25:20] rights like esau did for a mess of
[1:25:21] potter's that's all you're going to get
[1:25:22] that's all
[1:25:24] now what brother branham said is there's
[1:25:26] a time when they couldn't put aside
[1:25:27] their differences
[1:25:28] and unite together because there was no
[1:25:29] purpose to right but
[1:25:31] but when there's when it looks like your
[1:25:33] whole belief system is going to be
[1:25:35] overtaken then you're going to put aside
[1:25:38] your differences and unite together and
[1:25:39] fight back
[1:25:40] right and that's the the climate that
[1:25:42] we've got now is that there's so much of
[1:25:43] this evil communist dark force coming
[1:25:45] around that that
[1:25:46] that the christians and this whole group
[1:25:49] are saying actually we've just got to
[1:25:50] put everything aside because we've got a
[1:25:51] greater cause
[1:25:52] which is this and we can put aside all
[1:25:54] our differences and we can now unite and
[1:25:56] that's what's happening
[1:25:57] that's what's happening and and it will
[1:26:00] get exciting when they start winning
[1:26:02] because for a long time it's like
[1:26:03] they've been losing and it's going to be
[1:26:05] exciting when they start winning because
[1:26:06] they're going to start winning that's
[1:26:08] what
[1:26:08] is prophesied and they're going to be
[1:26:10] like wow we couldn't believe and it's
[1:26:11] there's going to be a
[1:26:12] revival you know we can't believe we're
[1:26:14] winning you know praise god
[1:26:16] you know but it's all of the devil
[1:26:20] right so now here's our diagram again
[1:26:22] but this is now this is now the
[1:26:23] this is us right now 2020 exactly what's
[1:26:27] happening the same way
[1:26:28] you've got you've got the three groups
[1:26:30] the unbelievers
[1:26:31] i'm not people but you know just the
[1:26:34] unbelievers make believers and true
[1:26:35] believers that unbelievers are like this
[1:26:36] communist evil force that's coming on
[1:26:38] the make believers are romanism and
[1:26:40] dominationism that sort of
[1:26:42] and then you've got the true believers
[1:26:43] which is the bride and you had the same
[1:26:45] thing
[1:26:46] again you know the the word came you
[1:26:49] know
[1:26:49] but the the denominations united against
[1:26:53] the word and and in everywhere that it
[1:26:55] was they kicked it out and
[1:26:56] that's where we stand today is you can't
[1:26:58] the word is not welcome in any
[1:27:00] any places right so this is now
[1:27:05] we stand in a very awkward position
[1:27:06] people because we've got no friends
[1:27:09] right see the only friend we've got in
[1:27:13] this whole thing
[1:27:14] the only friend we have is the lord
[1:27:15] jesus and and the bride
[1:27:18] that's when you look at that's that's
[1:27:20] all we've got no one else is on our side
[1:27:22] just give me jesus that's
[1:27:25] and that's that's hope that's our whole
[1:27:28] that's our whole political theme
[1:27:29] jesus that's all we got you know
[1:27:32] that's a so that's so that's where we
[1:27:34] stand in this this whole battle you know
[1:27:37] now once that happened then of course
[1:27:41] this next scenario happens where the
[1:27:44] where this communist this evil force
[1:27:46] comes and rises up against the church
[1:27:48] against
[1:27:48] against that you know and that's what's
[1:27:50] happening now and then
[1:27:52] like i said it all bands together to
[1:27:54] fight back
[1:27:56] against this communism against this
[1:27:58] force of evil
[1:27:59] that's what i'm saying we don't have a
[1:28:00] part in this fight yeah that's what i
[1:28:02] was saying earlier
[1:28:03] this is not our battle we're not we're
[1:28:05] not on any of these teams you know we're
[1:28:07] not on the unbelievers team we're not on
[1:28:08] this other team
[1:28:10] we're all on our own with just the lord
[1:28:12] but that's all that we need we don't
[1:28:13] need anyone else you know
[1:28:15] we don't we we don't we don't need to
[1:28:18] we're not we're just fighting for his
[1:28:19] kingdom
[1:28:20] for his bride you know and for his cause
[1:28:22] which is just to
[1:28:24] just to find the last one and go
[1:28:27] you know so in amongst this ferocious
[1:28:29] battle it's ferocious
[1:28:31] all around us it's going to be very
[1:28:33] challenging for us not to
[1:28:35] get caught up in it because it's going
[1:28:36] to get worse and worse and worse it's
[1:28:38] going to be
[1:28:38] we have to make sure that we know
[1:28:42] what we're doing and just stay on track
[1:28:44] because it's going to be very tempting
[1:28:46] very tempting to to join in especially
[1:28:49] when people start their
[1:28:51] our people start winning it's like oh
[1:28:54] maybe i should you know
[1:28:55] sign up now i'm not saying don't sign up
[1:28:57] i'm not saying that look i'm not trying
[1:28:58] to advocate political things but i'm
[1:28:59] just pointing out to you
[1:29:01] the overarching truth of the matter is
[1:29:04] this is our team christ and his word are
[1:29:07] our team
[1:29:08] you know and and that's the he's going
[1:29:10] to be the winner in the whole thing so
[1:29:12] we're already with a winner there's no
[1:29:13] need to go with any other winners
[1:29:15] i've got three quotes to read then i'm
[1:29:16] done and this is just finishing it
[1:29:19] communism has to rise these other things
[1:29:20] has to rise and the church has to unite
[1:29:22] itself at yonder
[1:29:23] when those in the nations out there for
[1:29:24] the world council of churches and the
[1:29:26] bride has to unite itself under the word
[1:29:27] of god
[1:29:28] in order to do that god has sent down
[1:29:30] the heavenly sign and things that prove
[1:29:32] to the church
[1:29:33] and he has to and as he has to the
[1:29:36] nation amen
[1:29:38] god uniting time yes oh my now you
[1:29:40] remember now
[1:29:41] there is the uniting of the word uniting
[1:29:43] back again bringing back the faith that
[1:29:45] was once delivered to the saints
[1:29:47] bring him back this could only be done
[1:29:48] on this day the only time it could be
[1:29:50] done is right now
[1:29:52] it never was attacked anywhere else they
[1:29:54] went off on denominational sprees
[1:29:56] but now it don't belong to no
[1:29:58] denominational denominational spree
[1:30:00] because it's time for the uniting of men
[1:30:02] and women of every race every color
[1:30:05] every creed everything under christ
[1:30:07] by the baptism of the holy spirit and
[1:30:09] back to the word
[1:30:10] uniting time for the bride oh my uniting
[1:30:13] every word that's been scattered all
[1:30:15] abroad by these organizations
[1:30:17] ever since that night here rome when
[1:30:19] they organized the first church and
[1:30:20] they've organized luther they've
[1:30:21] organized wesley
[1:30:23] they organized all the rest of the
[1:30:24] churches and doing that they had to
[1:30:25] adopt the creed
[1:30:26] and then when god sent someone else they
[1:30:28] could not receive it therefore it was
[1:30:30] not possible until
[1:30:31] now and god promised in the last days
[1:30:32] that the faith of the fathers will be
[1:30:34] restored back to the bride again
[1:30:36] and that it will be this way and it
[1:30:38] couldn't be no other time
[1:30:40] but this time right now
[1:30:43] look what a sign from heaven is a pillar
[1:30:45] of fire hanging amongst us
[1:30:46] and with signs and wonders of the lord
[1:30:48] jesus christ and while he speaks to us
[1:30:49] that never fails to be perfectly on the
[1:30:51] dot
[1:30:52] amen then when we see where we're
[1:30:55] standing
[1:30:56] uniting time we see nations uniting we
[1:30:58] see the world uniting we see communism
[1:31:00] uniting
[1:31:00] we see the church is uniting and we see
[1:31:03] god uniting himself with his bride
[1:31:05] until here in the church is the same
[1:31:07] thing hallelujah like the pyramid there
[1:31:09] right uniting themselves together god
[1:31:12] uniting why never
[1:31:13] never before since the early church was
[1:31:15] a pillar of fire ever among the people
[1:31:17] never before since the early church did
[1:31:18] they ever see the things that we're
[1:31:20] seeing
[1:31:20] today
[1:31:23] sorry and this was only made possible
[1:31:25] when god sent the seven seals and give
[1:31:27] us a sign bite and send seven angels
[1:31:29] down out of heaven
[1:31:30] and come to bring back that scattered
[1:31:32] word in them denominations
[1:31:33] and tie it back to the word of god again
[1:31:35] and bring down his holy spirit
[1:31:37] jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:31:39] word abide in you then ask what you will
[1:31:41] it shall be done unto you
[1:31:42] uniting the bride back with the word
[1:31:44] which is god the church and the word
[1:31:46] not the church and the creed the church
[1:31:48] and the word the bride and the word
[1:31:51] united together it's uniting time
[1:31:56] and that's that's the that's the camp
[1:31:59] that we're in
[1:32:00] is the camp of christ being united with
[1:32:01] christ and his word according to the
[1:32:03] message of brother branham the
[1:32:05] the the the inspired word for this
[1:32:08] this time not just any old word but the
[1:32:10] word through a prophet of this time
[1:32:12] and do we want with all the other stuff
[1:32:15] but just keep in mind
[1:32:16] our main main goal and it's going to be
[1:32:19] a privilege to go through these times
[1:32:21] with you all
[1:32:22] right because it's we're in treacherous
[1:32:23] times you know this is very treacherous
[1:32:25] we're in
[1:32:27] but it's only going to get better for
[1:32:29] the bride that's what our promise has
[1:32:30] been it's actually going to get better
[1:32:32] and better and that
[1:32:32] the power and the presence of god is
[1:32:34] going to come more and more
[1:32:36] all the time that's what's going to
[1:32:37] happen so it's actually going to be one
[1:32:38] of the best times
[1:32:40] for humanity for for the christian to
[1:32:42] ever be and it's going to be now
[1:32:44] it's going we're we're approaching the
[1:32:45] greatest time for the believer that
